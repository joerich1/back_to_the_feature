THE SON pg3

PETER
Has something happened

KATE
Yes

She hesitates lost in emotion as if she doesn’t know where
to begin This seems to irritate PETER

PETER
Well tell me

PETER glances discreetly back through the door to check that
BETH is not listening in on them KATE notices

KATE
Am I bothering you

PETER
What

KATE
This is your son I’m talking about
Shouldn’t you be just a little bit
concerned

PETER
Of course I’m concerned Why are

her account

PETER (CONTD)
What’s going on

THE SON pg4

PETER
Back up a minute He hasn’t been
to school for almost a month And
all this time you never noticed
anything How is that possible

KATE
He headed out every morning with
his bag and everything he needed
for the day as if nothing was
wrong Except he didn’t go there

PETER
And the school

KATE
Seems they sent me a bunch of
emails but I never got them

PETER
But What was he doing I mean
all day Where did he go

KATE
I don’t know He barely even
answers my questions anymore

PETER is having difficulty grasping this What’s going on

I’m so worried about him Peter

Suddenly BETH appears in the doorway PETER’s embarrassed
as if caught in a compromising situation

What’s going on
PETER
Ah Beth Yes I’m Kate’s here

to talk to me about Nicholas We’ve
just found out he hasn’t been going
to school and

KATE
It’s not only that Peter He’s not

A slight feeling of discomfort

KATE (CONTD)
You need to speak to him I can’t
deal with it any more He needs
you Peter You can’t abandon him
THE SON

PETER
I’m not abandoning him Why do you
keep saying these things

KATE
The other day I asked him to I
can’t even remember what to take
his plate out or something and

he looked at me with such with
such hatred I thought he was going
to

PETER
To what

KATE
He scares me okay

This admission sends chills down his spine

KATE makes an affectionate gesture to thank him It’s enough
to make PETER feel embarrassed in front of BETH KATE

notices

In the distance the baby starts crying and BETH after a
slight annoyed hesitation goes off to look after him

PETER and KATE remain on the landing An intimate moment

PETER
I’1l go see him tomorrow I’11

NICHOLAS is already on the sofa biting his nails

PETER
Your mother told me you haven’t
been going to school What’s

me

Pause NICHOLAS doesn’t answer PETER sits down opposite him

hard time at the moment And I
know youre mad at me But that’s
not a reason for us not to talk to
each other Why have you stopped
going to school

NICHOLAS
Don’t know

PETER
You don’t know

NICHOLAS shakes his head
THE SON

PETER (CONTD)
There must be a reason

NICHOLAS shrugs

Pause

PETER (CONTD)
You can’t decide to suddenly stop
going to school It’s not an
option

PETER (CONTD)
Do you hear what I’m saying

NICHOLAS
Yes

PETER
Are you having problems

NICHOLAS sighs

PETER (CONTD)
Why are you sighing

NICHOLAS
No reason

PETER
There’s got to be a reason Tell
me

NICHOLAS
I don’t want to talk about it

He gets up and heads for his bedroom

appears in the doorway

hasn’t seen for some time

PETER (CONTD)
What were you doing All those

NICHOLAS
I walked

PETER
You walked

NICHOLAS nods

PETER (CONTD)
On your own

NICHOLAS
Yes

PETER
In the street

NICHOLAS
Or in the park

PETER
But why Nicholas You think
that’s acceptable And with your
SATs coming up as well

NICHOLAS still doesn’t say anything

PETER (CONTD)
And stop biting your nails You’1ll
make them bleed

NICHOLAS takes his hand away from his mouth

PETER (CONTD)
You realize the school is talking
about expelling you

NICHOLAS
I wasn’t feeling well Going for

relaxed me

PETER
Why weren’t you feeling well

No answer PETER comes and sits down next to him on the bed

PETER (CONTD)

you to boarding school Is that
what you want

NICHOLAS
No

PETER
So You have to do something You
can’t just let things go like
this

It’s clear that the mention of boarding school has shaken
NICHOLAS He stands up and moves away from the bed

NICHOLAS
I can’t deal with any of it

PETER
What makes you say that Has
something happened at school

NICHOLAS
No
PETER
Or outside of school We can

Yes
NICHOLAS

I don’t know how to describe it

PETER
Tell me in your own words

NICHOLAS
It’s life it’s weighing me down

PETER seems moved by this confession made with a disarming
sincerity

PETER
What is it about life that isn’t
working for you
THE SON pg-11

NICHOLAS
I don’t know I want something to
change but I don’t know what
That’s why I’ve been telling
myself that maybe

NICHOLAS is hesitating

PETER
Tell me

NICHOLAS
Id like to live with you

PETER is caught completely off-guard

PETER
With me you mean

NICHOLAS
I can’t go on here Because I know
I could get out of this But not

difficult

PETER
Yes but

NICHOLAS
Me and Mom we’re not getting

brother

PETER
Yes

NICHOLAS

head feels like it’s exploding

close to tears
THE SON pg12

Disarming sincerity PETER hugs him closer

concerned there’s nothing to discuss He puts on this coat

wondering if it would maybe be
better to start again in September
with less pressure and

When I’m in pain it’s a way to
channel the pain

PETER
But what pain Nicholas A way to
channel what pain

NICHOLAS lowers his eyes Still no answer PETER tries to
calm down and pull himself together

more I’m forbidding you to do

No answer

PETER (CONTD)

just don’t do

NICHOLAS
Was it Beth who found it

PETER
Doesn’t matter
THE SON pg-51

NICHOLAS
What’s she doing searching through

PETER
She’s not searching through your
stuff She was kind enough to make
your bed Since you never make it
yourself

NICHOLAS sighs

PETER (CONTD)
Well Nicholas you took a knife
out of the kitchen to

NICHOLAS
No At first I just wanted to have
something to defend myself

PETER
Defend yourself Defend yourself
from what What are you talking
about You realize this makes no
sense at all

NICHOLAS
Well you have a gun

PETER
What

NICHOLAS

In the laundry room behind the
closet there’s a gun

PETER
Huh Yes but that’s That’s
different It’s it was a gift

NICHOLAS
Who gave you a gun

PETER clearly doesn’t want to go into the details but he
feels obliged to offer some explanation

PETER
My father A long time ago He
loved hunting It’s a hunting
rifle See It’s not there so I
can “defend myself”

NICHOLAS
Why did he give you a hunting
rifle

THE SON pg52

PETER
To He must have thought I’d like
it That it was something we

could do together That But
you know I never used it I hate
hunting And everything that goes
along with it

NICHOLAS
So why do you keep it
PETER
Nicholas This is not what we are

talking about
PETER attempts to calm down and change his approach

PETER (CONTD)
I don’t understand why you are
doing this kind of thing

NICHOLAS
I know

PETER
What happened at your last school
This might be the time to tell me
about it don’t you think

No answer

PETER (CONTD)
Because something must have
happened Otherwise

NICHOLAS doesn’t answer

PETER (CONTD)
If you don’t want to talk to me
I hope you talk to your therapist
about it

Pause

PETER (CONTD)
This is important Nicholas

NICHOLAS seems to say “yes” with his head PETER approaches
his son He gently takes his arm and looks at his scars

PETER (CONTD)
I’m going to get you some
disinfectant

NICHOLAS
No no It’s just scratches

THE SON pg53

PETER makes an affectionate gesture

PETER
You know when you hurt yourself
it’s as if you were doing it to me

NICHOLAS
And when you hurt Mom you were
doing it to me

PETER is caught off-guard and doesn’t know what to say
NICHOLAS goes leaving PETER alone with his guilt

NICHOLAS looks at his little brother and smiles He goes to
sit down beside them He seems melancholy

BETH (CONTD)
Still thinking about that girl

NICHOLAS is surprised How does she know BETH feels the need
to explain

BETH (CONTD)
Your dad told me I mean he told
me you’d finally explained to him
what happened At your old
school

NICHOLAS
What did he tell you
BETH
Nothing He just said I mean

that you’d had this girlfriend and
that you’d broken up

NICHOLAS lowers his eyes

BETH (CONTD)
Don’t worry In the end we forget
these things

He smiles at her a touch sadly Then he stretches out
alongside his little brother

NICHOLAS
You know I meant to say I know
you I mean you didn’t choose to
live with me And I I do I

appreciate the fact you That you
weren’t against my moving in here

BETH
Why should I be against it You’re
Theo’s brother So it’s your home
too

EXT WASHINGTON DC HOUSE DAY 62

PETER rings the bell He seems on edge The door is opened by
ANTHONY 83

ANTHONY
You’re early
PETER
Hello Dad
ANTHONY
Come in
PETER does so
INT WASHINGTON DC HOUSE HALLWAYOFFICE DAY 63

PETER follows ANTHONY who’s heading for his den or office

ANTHONY
Something to drink

PETER
Why not

ANTHONY’s already pouring two whiskies PETER steps into the
office behind him He’s re-experiencing the very particular
atmosphere of this house and especially this office There
are several hunting trophies on the wall illustrating one of
ANTHONY’s passions There are also a number of photos of
ANTHONY with various politicians including George W Bush
He’s clearly had an A-list career in Washington

ANTHONY turns to PETER and hands him a glass

ANTHONY
So To what do I owe the honor of
this surprise visit

PETER
I No particular reason I I
was passing through DC I wanted
to see how you were doing

ANTHONY is looking at him suspiciously He doesn’t appear to
believe there’s any action without ulterior motives

ANTHONY
Don’t listen to the rumors about my
health There’s nothing wrong Just
a minor complaint I’ve never been
fitter

PETER
Well good

THE SON pg58

ANTHONY
Maria’s prepared a little dinner
for us Cheers Duck how does
that sound

PETER acknowledges this and takes a mouthful of his drink
Clearly he has some difficulty knowing how to behave in his
father’s company

sweat-shirt

The washing machine is on

INT WASHINGTON DC HOUSE DINING ROOM DAY 66

They’re in the middle of dinner ANTHONY’s in full flow
PETER listens politely dispassionate as if he’s heard all
this a hundred times before

ANTHONY
No the problem these days is that
people are scared of everything
Just look around you A bunch of
sniveling cowards Nobody ever
wants to take any kind of a risk
That’s why the West isn’t going to
last much longer I’ve been saying
it for years and the facts are
beginning to bear me out If you’re
looking for energy courage and
enterprise I’m sorry to say this
you have to go to Asia In the
coming decades it won’t be
Washington it’1ll be Beijing

MARIA appears She’s serving the food She offers PETER a
second helping

PETER
No thank you Maria It was
delicious

MARIA
My pleasure

She smiles She moves towards ANTHONY
THE SON pg59

ANTHONY
No thanks

MARIA leaves the room ANTHONY pushes his plate away

ANTHONY (CONTD)
So what about you Tell me I
thought you hated DC What are you
doing in this neck of the woods

PETER
I had a meeting with Brian Hammer

ANTHONY
Oh

It seems the referencing of the Senator has some positive
effect on ANTHONY PETER senses this He derives a strange
kind of pride from his desire to impress him

PETER
He’s going to stand in the
Primaries

ANTHONY
Yes I know

PETER
And he wants me to help him with
his campaign

ANTHONY
He’s offered to take you on his
team

PETER
Yes

ANTHONY inclines his head to convey “well done bravo” All
the same he seems dubious knowing his son has always felt
ambivalent about politics Above all this Senator is not in
ANTHONY’s party

PETER (CONTD)
But I haven’t decided if I’m going
to accept

ANTHONY
Why not

PETER
The problem is it’ll take too much
of my time

ANTHONY
So
THE SON pg60

PETER
So it’s complicated

ANTHONY
What’s complicated about it

PETER
It’s not a very good time Nicholas
is going through a difficult
spell He’s seventeen He’s come
to live with me and He’s
improving but I think he’s still
fragile I wouldn’t want to be away
just when

ANTHONY has started to laugh quietly which stops PETER short
in mid-explanation

PETER (CONTD)
What

ANTHONY
Is this why you came to see me To
tell me what a good dad you are

PETER
No I

ANTHONY
Obviously it is You came to show
me irrefutable proof of your moral
superiority It’s true isn’t it
You came to demonstrate to me that
you you can give up your ambitions
to look after your son As opposed
to me is that it

PETER
Not at all you

ANTHONY
Are you still at it Really
Blaming me for what happened more
than forty years ago Trying to
show me what a model dad you are
What do you want Applause

PETER
It’s funny you should say that
because The other day I was

thinking again about The time
When I was Nicholas’s age That’s
right

ANTHONY

See

THE SON pg-61

PETER
Mom was ill I went to see her in
the hospital every day after school
and sat with her You never
showed up You were traveling all
the time

ANTHONY
I was working

PETER
But the week before Before she
died I ran into Tom He told me

he’d had dinner with you the night
before I didn’t even know you
were in town You didn’t think it
was worth telling us or coming to
see her

ANTHONY
Listen if it suits you I can
easily take on the role of monster
And bow before your perfection
Yes you suffered so much Yes
your daddy wasn’t nice to you Or
to your momma Fine So what Don’t
you think it’s time you started
growing up Because believe me
it’s pathetic watching a man of
fifty chained to the teenager he
once was If you want my advice
get over it Get over it for God’s
sake

INT PETER and BETH’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT 67
PETER opens his eyes It’s the middle of the night THEO is

No On the contrary

He smiles at her and steps into the living-room

INT PETER and BETH’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAY 69

comes to sit down beside him

Yes

PETER

He moves away out of the room

BETH
You haven’t seen them
NICHOLAS
What
BETH

My mother-of-pearl earrings The
ones your father gave me They
were here somewhere a minute ago

She sounds almost suspicious

NICHOLAS
No

NICHOLAS turns off the TV and gets up as if he were trying
to avoid the conversation
THE SON pg64

BETH
I keep losing things

NICHOLAS is watching her from a distance
NICHOLAS

You changed your dress That one
looks good on you

THE SON

NICHOLAS leaves somewhat disappointed PETER looks daggers
at BETH

BETH
What

PETER indicates “nothing”

BETH (CONTD)
Why are you looking at me like

that

PETER
Why do you think He made a kind
suggestion I don’t know why you
refused

BETH
You don’t

PETER

No He’s his little brother He can
look after him

BETH
I’m just not sure He’s only a baby
and

PETER

And what You always see things in
such a dark light

BETH
Better to see things in a dark
light than not to see them at all

PETER
What do you mean

BETH
Nothing

She goes toward the kitchen He follows her

PETER
Yes tell me What am I not
seeing

BETH
Forget it

PETER
You really believe Nicholas is not
capable of looking after his little
brother when he’s asleep

pg66
THE SON pg67

BETH
He’s You know very well He’s
been depressed He’s still
unstable He’s even I’m sorry if
this shocks you But I’m not
trusting my son to

PETER
To

At this moment NICHOLAS appears in the doorway He’s holding
the earrings in his hand But PETER and BETH aren’t aware of
his presence

PETER (CONTD)
Go on say it You’re not trusting
your son to
BETH
Stop it
PETER
Say it
BETH

He’s weird Don’t say he isn’t In
fact he’s really weird The look
in his eyes it’s worrying
sometimes He I mean let’s
face it why can’t you see what’s
there in front of you he’s not
right in the head

Suddenly BETH becomes aware of NICHOLAS PETER seeing
BETH’s aghast expression turns and also sees NICHOLAS who
has clearly heard the whole conversation

PETER
Nicholas You What are you

NICHOLAS doesn’t move
PETER (CONTD)
We didn’t mean We were just
disappointed we couldn’t go out
tonight It’s nothing to do with
you
NICHOLAS puts the earrings down on the table

They were out in the hallway

Then he heads for his room

I mean You Are you all right

INT KATE’S APARTMENT KITCHENDINING ROOM DAY 74

NICHOLAS is sitting at the dinner table KATE comes from the
kitchen with a glass of milk which NICHOLAS doesn’t touch

KATE
Your dad told me you were happy at
your new school Aren’t you

NICHOLAS nods but not very enthusiastically

KATE (CONTD)
Huh And he told me everything was
going ok for you at his place

NICHOLAS
I hoped

He can’t finish his sentence

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
But in the end there’s no room for
me They find me disturbing more
than anything else And he puts so
much pressure on me

KATE
Your dad

NICHOLAS
He doesn’t realize it but he never
stops talking to me about my school
work As if that’s all there was to
life
THE SON pg69

KATE
It’s normal He worries about you

NICHOLAS
No he doesn’t give a shit about
me I mean about who I really am
He just wants me to succeed like
him The way he has But I have no
desire to be a law student or to
become a lawyer It doesn’t
interest me

KATE
You used to dream about being a
writer Are you still writing

NICHOLAS shrugs

KATE (CONTD)
You remind me of my brother Both
of you are artists

NICHOLAS
I never said that Anyway he went
into insurance So thanks for the
comparison

KATE
I always thought he could have done
great things If he’d persevered
And so could you

NICHOLAS
Anyway I’m not feeling good over
there I’d rather come back and
live here

KATE tries very hard to conceal her pleasure

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
I don’t think I’1l ever be up to
standard

KATE
What are you talking about Your
father wants the best for you
Nicholas He loves you He believes
in you It’s just you’re very
different And I suspect that at
the moment he’s also under a lot of
pressure All this business with
the Primaries don’t you think

NICHOLAS shrugs
THE SON pg70

KATE (CONTD)
It’s important to him you know
He’s been dreaming about doing this
for years

NICHOLAS moves away

NICHOLAS
It’s not just that

NICHOLAS hesitates to confide in her further KATE pushes him
to do so

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Im not well Mom

KATE
Your dad told me you’d broken up
with a girl

NICHOLAS
Yes I know that’s what I told
him He didn’t understand what was
wrong He needed a rational
explanation You know what he’s
like So I told him what he
wanted to hear But I never even
went out with that girl It’s
just

His mother looks at him questioningly

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
It’s just that I’m not made like
other people Sometimes I feel I’m
not made for this life I can’t
deal with any of it Even so I
try every day with all my
strength but I can’t deal with it
I’m in pain all the time And I’m
tired I’m tired of being in pain

NICHOLAS weeps

KATE
Nicholas

She takes him in her arms

NICHOLAS
I want it to end Mom

KATE is extremely upset

KATE
Don’t say that my love You have

so much ahead of you

JULIA
Yes it will I remember it was
the exact same with Josh And
then gradually

Suddenly BETH sees a figure in the distance who looks like
NICHOLAS

JULIA (CONTD)
What Who’s that

Nobody

The distant figure disappears behind a tree BETH’s on her
feet She could have sworn it was NICHOLAS

Yes

pg72
THE SON

pg73

PETER
How did it go

NICHOLAS
Well I think

PETER
Good

PETER stares at NICHOLAS to see if he’1ll lower his guard but
NICHOLAS seems completely sincere This astonishes PETER

PETER (CONTD)
Only you see this afternoon Beth
went to the park And she saw you
I don’t know what you were doing
but in any case you weren’t at
school So I’m going to ask you
one last time and this time I want
an answer What’s going on

NICHOLAS lowers his eyes

Pause

PETER (CONTD)
Youve started to skip classes
again is that it

NICHOLAS
No

PETER
Then why weren’t you in school
today

NICHOLAS

Why did she tell you that

PETER
That’s not the problem

NICHOLAS
Yes it is the problem She wants
to turn us against one another

PETER
No the problem is you’re lying to
me Nicholas

PETER (CONTD)
Why weren’t you at school today
I’m listening

NICHOLAS
I didn’t feel good I I couldn’t
bring myself to go

(MORE)

THE SON pg74

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
I’m under too much pressure because
of this test and I I’m sorry

PETER
You’re sorry

PETER cannot believe Nicholas has the nerve to lie to his
face He goes to sit down He seems crushed by the situation
Pause He tries to stay calm

PETER (CONTD)
I called the school I called them
And you know what they told me
They told me you’d never been back
there

NICHOLAS doesn’t dare look his father in the eye

PETER (CONTD)
They told me you were there on the
first day last month and
afterwards you never came back
Never Not once It seems they got
an email from me saying wed
decided to send you back to your
old school

NICHOLAS says nothing

PETER (CONTD)
Nothing to say

Pause

PETER (CONTD)
So you’ve become a world-class
hacker am I right

PETER gets up

PETER (CONTD)
When I think you had the balls to
tell me you were getting As and
being invited to parties and The
whole time you were lying to me

PETER starts pacing up and down
PETER (CONTD)
What have you been doing all these
days Going for walks Is that it
You

PETER seems more and more at a loss

THE SON

PETER (CONTD)
We give you a chance to climb back
up and what do you do You do the
exact same thing You lie to
everybody You

He can’t think of what else to say

PETER (CONTD)
Explain it to me What’s going on
Are you on drugs

NICHOLAS smiles

PETER (CONTD)
Then explain it to me I don’t know
what else to do with you I’m
telling you straight I just don’t
know I’ve tried to listen to you
to be there for you to give you
strength and confidence but
obviously none of that’s any use

Pause But PETER now can’t stop himself NICHOLAS bites his
nails

PETER (CONTD)
You think you can live your life
like that Just doing whatever the
hell you feel like Getting out of
school never taking any
responsibility refusing to grow
up What do you want

At this point NICHOLAS raises his eyes and from now on
stares fixedly and as if defiantly at PETER

PETER (CONTD)
What are you going to do with your
life If you’re not doing anything
Tell me what’s going to become of
you

No answer

PETER (CONTD)
Naturally you have no answer

PETER notices NICHOLAS’s fixed stare

PETER (CONTD)
And stop staring at me like that

intimidate me That’s not going to

way

PETER

about life and work then you
abandon us as if we were pieces of

asshole

NICHOLAS tries to leave but PETER is holding him back

PETER (CONTD)

those years for your sake So why
are you saying this Why

NICHOLAS tries to struggle free but PETER holds on to him

NICHOLAS
Let me go

PETER
Tell me why Is it because I fell
in love with another woman Is that
my crime

PETER’s in tears and he shakes his son more and more
violently He’s desperate

NICHOLAS
Stop it

How is it any of your business I
have the right to reinvent my life
Fuck It’s my life You hear me

NICHOLAS falls on the floor He is terrified Like a 6-year-
old

PETER is wracked with the emotions he’s just expressed and
the violence which has swept over him Pause

PETER reaches for NICHOLAS’s shoulder as if to pacify him
PETER (CONTD)
I’m sorry Nicholas I I don’t

know what just happened

He wants to help him get up but NICHOLAS snatches his hand
violently away and heads for the front door

the end

Suddenly the EMERGENCY ROOM PSYCHIATRIST appears KATE gets
up as soon as she sees her

PETER (CONTD)
Ah doctor

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Good afternoon I’m Dr Leiner I’m
looking after your son

She shakes KATE’s hand

KATE
Where’s Nicholas

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Don’t worry He’s resting He’s no
longer in danger I assure you

KATE
Can we see him
THE SON pg82

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Some of our medical team are still
meeting with him So let’s give
them a little space for a moment
In the meantime I’d like to
discuss the situation with you

She motions to invite them into her office

84 INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE DAY 84
KATE and PETER step into the office

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Please sit down

KATE
What’s happening

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Your son was treated very quickly
And the cut wasn’t too deep It
should heal well

KATE
You’re absolutely sure of that

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Yes Trust me

KATE
Thank God

KATE sits down

ER PSYCHIATRIST
But we need to make some
decisions I’ve talked to hima
little

KATE
What did he say

ER PSYCHIATRIST
He seems frustrated to have woken
up here Which is very common in
this sort of case

PETER
Has he said anything About what
caused him to

ER PSYCHIATRIST
You know we’re very used to these
situations

(MORE )
THE SON pg83

ER PSYCHIATRIST (CONTD)
And I think it could be important
for Nicholas to spend some time
under observation

KATE
Under observation

PETER
You mean

ER PSYCHIATRIST
I just checked and there is a
vacancy in our facility

KATE
What I mean You just told us
he wasn’t in danger

ER PSYCHIATRIST
What we want is for him to acquire
an awareness of what he’s done His
tendency at the moment is to
minimize it somewhat which seems
to me dangerous We wouldn’t want
him to try it again

PETER
But how long would he need to stay

ER PSYCHIATRIST
What’s important is for us to be
able to monitor and treat him Then
there’ll be regular meetings with
the In-Patient Psychiatrist and
Nicholas so we can all assess his
progress

KATE
This is a nightmare

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Don’t worry he wont be on his
own We have a whole department
that specializes in treating young
people and adolescents So
there’ll be a medical team as well
as the other patients There are
all kinds of activities for them to
be involved in and Nicholas will be
under very close supervision

KATE
Id like to see him doctor

A MALE NURSE knocks and puts his head round the door

THE SON pg84

ER PSYCHIATRIST
Please excuse me for a minute

She moves away exchanging a few words with the NURSE in the
corridor PETER and KATE remain silent absorbing the shock
PETER takes KATE’s hand

The PSYCHIATRIST comes back to them
ER PSYCHIATRIST (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m needed upstairs A
social worker will be in to help
you with the paperwork for Nicholas
to be admitted They can answer any
further questions at this stage
All right
PETER and KATE don’t know how to respond
ER PSYCHIATRIST (CONTD)

Please don’t worry finally he’s in
very good hands

suffering

EXT CORSICA DAY (FLASHBACK) 87

PETER and YOUNG NICHOLAS are crouching on the beach
gathering pebbles

YOUNG NICHOLAS points out a black pebble stained with little
yellow marks

YOUNG NICHOLAS
What about that one

PETER studies it carefully
PETER

That’s a “constellation” It’s like
you can see stars in it
THE SON pg85

YOUNG NICHOLAS
Is it rare

PETER
Pretty rare

YOUNG NICHOLAS
And that one

YOUNG NICHOLAS points out another pebble PETER looks at it
carefully

PETER
That one That’s a “Saturn” See
it has like rings round it

Suddenly KATE’s voice is heard in the distance

KATE
Peter

PETER sees her She’s wearing her big hat She’s aboard the
sailboat anchored a few meters out from the beach She’s
waiting for them and waves to them

PETER
Ah I think Mom’s getting
impatient Shall we go back

YOUNG NICHOLAS
Wait Daddy

YOUNG NICHOLAS hands him one of his armbands which has
deflated for him to blow up PETER breathes into it

PETER
Ah It’s split

YOUNG NICHOLAS
What are we going to do

PETER
We’1ll have to swim

YOUNG NICHOLAS
I can’t I’m only six and a half

This makes PETER smile

PETER
Youre right Just exactly the
right time to learn Come on

PETER starts walking towards the sea Then he turns back
YOUNG NICHOLAS hasn’t moved an inch He’d like to but he’s
scared PETER softens and reaches out a hand

THE SON pg87

PETER
Sure Everything alright

KATE
I’ve just had a call from Dr
Harris and I wanted to discuss

it with you

PETER
Is there a problem

KATE
He thinks it might be better if we
didn’t go and see Nicholas for a
few days

PETER
What

He stands

KATE
I know But it seems Nicholas is
having some trouble accepting the
treatment They’ve had long
discussions with him to try to
understand why he Seems he’s
talking a lot about the divorce
about your new life about the
tension between us And he
thinks Dr Harris thinks it might
help them if we left them in peace
for a few days

Pause PETER turns towards the big bay window and
contemplates the cityscape

KATE (CONTD)
Are you there

PETER
Yes

KATE
He says it would help give everyone
a bit of perspective take some

pressure off

PETER
He can’t stop us seeing Nicholas

KATE
He’s asking not demanding There’s
still our meeting on Monday to
take stock but in the meantime
he’d like us to

He gets closer and makes an affectionate gesture

BETH
Why can’t you come with us

to do here

PETER
I can’t

BETH
When is he coming out

PETER
I don’t know I’11 know more on

BETH
And then

Brief pause PETER doesn’t have an answer He goes to the
window

BETH (CONTD)
Why are you refusing to let him go
back to his mom’s I mean if
that’s what he wants

PETER
I didn’t say I was refusing It’s

just it won’t solve the problem

would be such a failure

BETH
For him or for you

THE SON

PETER
I hope I can be a better father to
Theo

BETH

Stop all this Peter You’re a very
good father

PETER raises his eyebrows He’s not convinced He looks out

of the window

PETER
What makes me sad is to have to
play a part I hate with everything
in me These last few weeks I keep
catching myself saying things
Exactly the same things my father
used to say to me when I was
young Things which made me
genuinely hate him And now it’s my
turn Makes me think I’ve wound up
being just like him

BETH
What kind of things

PETER
“What are you going to do with your
life” or “When I was your age I
did this or I did that” or “What
are we going to do with you” If
you knew how ashamed it makes me
feel

BETH receives a text

BETH
Right We have to go

He turns towards her

PETER
Before you do tell me you forgive
me for yesterday

BETH
Id really like us to stop fighting
like that

PETER
Me too

BETH
These last weeks have been
really

No you’re not on your own

BETH
Yes I am And I’m tired And
there’s Theo as well Your other
son And he needs you too

PETER
Beth please Let’s not start
again

Pause BETH tries to calm down
BETH
All right I’11 call you when we
get there OK

BETH goes to fetch her suitcase He catches her hand as she
passes She gives him a sad smile and frees herself

PETER approaches the stroller He smiles at THEO Then he
picks him up

PETER
Come on little man Give me a
hug I’m not going to see you for

a week And I’m going to miss you
He hugs him very tight

PETER (CONTD)
You’re going to discover the sea
You’1l see how big and beautiful it
is I’m sorry I can’t be with
you I really have to stay
here Do you understand But

All three of them embrace The NURSE interrupts their

reunion

NICHOLAS
Mom

Sweetheart

NICHOLAS

I’ve missed you so much

months

PETER
How are you

NICHOLAS starts talking fast as if he only has a few minutes
to explain the situation to them

NICHOLAS
It’s horrible You have to get me
out of here

PETER
Don’t worry

NICHOLAS
You absolutely have to get me out
of here Promise me

KATE
What’s wrong

NICHOLAS
It’s been terrible Mom The worst
week of my life I’m too sensitive

for a place like this I swear to
you it’s hell You can’t leave me
in hell

PETER

That’s what we’re here for to
discuss it with the doctor

NICHOLAS
He’s an asshole He doesn’t
understand anything He stuffs me
full of medication but he doesn’t
understand anything about what’s
going on in my head He thinks I’m
ill He told me I was going to have
to stay here for weeks and weeks
But I’m telling you I can’t I
won’t be able to take it I’1l
crack up You know what I’m
like I’m not just saying these
things I feel much worse here
than I do at home I need you
You have to take me back home
Please Dad please Mom I’m
begging you

PETER and KATE are unsettled by NICHOLAS’s nervous state
PETER

Calm down son We’ll talk to the
doctor

sweetheart

NICHOLAS smiles

NICHOLAS
I’m so happy to see you

The DOCTOR knocks on the door and comes in followed by the
NURSE

INT HOSPITAL MEETING ROOM DAY 98

DOCTOR
Hi good afternoon

KATE
Hello Doctor Harris

They shake hands

DOCTOR
Ok Why don’t we all sit down
Sit by me please Nicholas

This places NICHOLAS opposite rather than next to his
parents

DOCTOR (CONTD)
I’m going to ask Michael who’s
been looking after Nicholas to sit
in with us if you don’t mind

The NURSE closes the door and comes to sit close to NICHOLAS
NICHOLAS starts biting his nails

DOCTOR (CONTD)

Great Now I guess Nicholas has
told you he wants to leave the
hospital

PETER
Yes

DOCTOR

Yeah he’s said that to me too I
understand these last few days have
been tough on him

KATE
They really have been why is that

DOCTOR
We often get this reaction during
the first week

THE SON

pg95

NICHOLAS
I don’t want to stay here

DOCTOR
I understand you want to go home
Nicholas I really do But it’s not
something I’d be able to recommend

NICHOLAS turns to his parents

NICHOLAS
You see

PETER
Why not

DOCTOR

Nicholas is suffering from acute
depression I think it would be
safer for him to stay in the
hospital

NICHOLAS
No I’m better I just want to come
back home There isn’t going to be
a problem I promise

DOCTOR
I know that’s what you believe
Nicholas but in my experience

NICHOLAS stands up The NURSE also stands up as if prepared
to contain an outbreak of violence on NICHOLAS’s part

NICHOLAS
You see he knows how I’m feeling
better than I do

PETER
Calm down Nicholas

NICHOLAS
I am calm It’s this moron who
doesn’t understand anything

KATE
Nicholas please

Nicholas sits down So does the nurse Tense pause

PETER
What do you suggest

DOCTOR
Essentially we just need some more
time

(MORE)

THE SON

DOCTOR (CONTD)
Suicidal impulses they’re really
difficult to identify even for the
patient

(MORE)

pg95A

THE SON pg96

DOCTOR (CONTD)
But we can’t pretend they don’t
exist Second attempts are very
common

NICHOLAS is shaking his head As far as he is concerned the
DOCTOR is completely missing the point

DOCTOR (CONTD)
I think Nicholas is still suffering
from a certain disconnect from
reality which is causing him all
kinds of anxieties Which we can
treat We just have to stabilize
him first - and then we can start
thinking about when we can let him

go

KATE
And when will that be

NICHOLAS turns to his mother imploring her

NICHOLAS
Mom

DOCTOR
See Nicholas right now you need
looking after You need the whole
medical team doctors therapists
and project supervisors

NICHOLAS
You think you’re going to cure me
with a pottery class

DOCTOR
It contributes to the process yes

NICHOLAS
It’s a bunch of crap

KATE
Nicholas Calm down please

PETER
Maybe it’s for your own good if

NICHOLAS
My own good

NICHOLAS tries to calm down He knows he has to change his
approach in order to convince his parents

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
How can I get better if I’m
surrounded by people who are much

sicker than I am
(MORE )

THE SON pg97

NICHOLAS (CONTD)

I’ve been thinking about this you
know About my life All these
hours doing nothing And I’m not
the same any more I’ve grown up
all of a sudden I’ve understood
about things Things I won’t do
any More

NICHOLAS puts all his energy into trying to be convincing in
front of his parents

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Being here has been like an
electric shock And now I feel I’m
ready to return to normal life I
feel I can go back to school I
feel it You got to trust me You
got to take me out of here
Otherwise I’m going under I mean
it I can’t take this

KATE looks at PETER Does he feel like she feels NICHOLAS
senses his father may also be changing his mind

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Dad You understand me I know
you do You always have But here
they don’t I’m begging you Dad
Don’t abandon me

Pause PETER looks at KATE then he turns to the DOCTOR

PETER
What would be the procedure for
taking him out

NICHOLAS smiles profoundly relieved
The DOCTOR for his part seems rather annoyed

DOCTOR
As long as he’s under-age Nicholas
is your responsibility And this is
your decision But please listen
very seriously to what I’m telling
you your son is not in a state to
leave here All you have to do is
sign the papers and he can go
home But it’s my professional
opinion you’d be taking a genuine
risk

NICHOLAS
What risk
THE SON pg-98

DOCTOR
A risk Id never take with my own
son

NICHOLAS is becoming increasingly nervous as he sees his
parents may be changing sides

NICHOLAS
You can’t force me to stay here

DOCTOR
Well you know technically I
could But I’d have to get a judge
to agree and I really don’t want to
have to do that I’d rather help
your parents to make the right
decision

NICHOLAS
Dad Mom

DOCTOR
Believe me I know this isn’t easy
for you Especially here in front
of your son But Nicholas needs
treatment And that’s not part of
your role as parents It’s a job
for a psychiatrist

NICHOLAS
Dad I’m not ill

DOCTOR
If we make the right decision
together Nicholas will be able to
come back to you soon in much
better health and lead a normal
life But make no mistake The
stakes couldn’t be higher

NICHOLAS
Mom I want to go home
KATE
I know sweetheart I Peter

What should Say something

NICHOLAS
Don’t leave me here I’m begging
you I need you

DOCTOR
OK
THE SON pg99

NICHOLAS
I swear to you I understand now
You have to give me a second
chance It was a cry for help
I’m sorry about it with all my
heart I needed you to understand
my pain But I’1ll never do it
again I swear to you

DOCTOR
I think your parents have heard
your arguments Nicholas

NICHOLAS
Please

DOCTOR
Now I’m going to have to ask you
to make a decision

PETER
Now

DOCTOR
Yes Nicholas has to understand
that you support the medical team

NICHOLAS
Dad

PETER still doesn’t say anything he’s tortured by this
impossible decision

DOCTOR

Don’t feel guilty This is not
about how much you love your son
It’s about protecting him In these
circumstances love is not enough
Love will not be enough

NICHOLAS

Dad

DOCTOR
It’s lunchtime Nicholas Michael’s
going to take you up to the
cafeteria

The NURSE stands up

DOCTOR (CONTD)
But first I think it’s important
your parents make their decision in
front of you It’ll help you accept
your treatment

Mom

Brief pause She looks at PETER
NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Dad take me home I’m begging you

PETER closes his eyes He’s made his decision He finally
brings himself to express it

I’m sorry Nicholas

NICHOLAS jumps up full of pain and rebelliousness

No Dad You can’t do that to me
Not you Dad Not you

NICHOLAS pushes the NURSE away violently

NICHOLAS
What did I ever do to you

The NURSE tries again to control him

have to trust him That’s
important

KATE
Yes

And if he doesn’t improve over the
next few days we can always take
him back But in the meantime he’s
better off here

NICHOLAS
It’s ready in one minute

He leaves the room toward the corridor

PETER stands and has a look towards the corridor to check

KATE
How do you see things I mean
Down the line

where Nicholas went to

PETER
Seems a little optimistic to hope
he’ll go back to school It’s May
already If you ask me the best
thing would be for him to get his
strength back and quietly start
again next school year

KATE
But what’s he going to do all day
He can’t be left on his own

He sits in front of her

We hear the sound of the kettle from the kitchen underlining

PETER
Maybe he could go back to live
with you if this is what he
wants And during the day I
could take him to the office To
work I mean as an intern

NICHOLAS’s absence

Nicholas reappears from the corridor and goes to the kitchen

KATE
You think that would interest him

PETER
In any case he’d learn a few new
things And I’d be there

KATE
With all the work you have going
on

PETER
I’m going to turn down Brian’s
offer

Why are you laughing I smell bad

I like seeing you together It’s
been a long time I mean since the

KATE
That’s true

NICHOLAS
It’s like the good old days

all together at last Is this what NICHOLAS has been trying

to achieve from the start

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Right I’1l take a shower

NICHOLAS stands

KATE
See you soon Ill wait for you

NICHOLAS is about to leave but he turns back to them

NICHOLAS
I just wanted to say I’m really

ask you to forgive me And I wanted
to tell you that I love you

feeling they’ve rediscovered the sweet and grateful child
they knew for years KATE smiles

How about that

PETER raises his eyes to the skies as if to say “tell me
about it”

He sits close to her

KATE (CONTD)
If you’re not doing anything today
why don’t you come to the movie
with us I’m sure it would make
Nicholas happy

PETER
I don’t know What were you
planning to see

KATE
You remember the time we used to
go to the movies in the middle of
the afternoon We used to tell
everyone we had very important
meetings and then we’d secretly
meet at the Angelika

PETER
Yes

KATE
I used to love that It felt like
playing hookey

The memory makes PETER smile

KATE (CONTD)
It was so long ago

Pause

Go on Come with us

She moves closer to him It’s years since they’ve been so
close to one another

Come with us today

PETER’s on the verge of agreeing KATE’s voice is almost a
whisper

KATE (CONTD)
Don’t you want to

Pause PETER is about to answer

Suddenly there’s a detonation They have a fraction of a
second of dread before they react And they thrown themselves
towards the laundry room

INT PETER and BETH’S APARTMENT CORRIDOR DAY 105

The CAMERA keeps its distance The inside of the laundry room
is not visible

PETER arrives at the doorway to the laundry room it’s clear
his son is on the floor He is gripped with dread A vision
of horror KATE throws herself into the laundry room and
drops to the floor to try to revive him

Their voices are almost covered by calm MUSIC which seems to
play against the panic and horror of the scene possibly
Fauré’s “Pie Jesu”

KATE
Nicholas Nicholas No oh no Oh
no Nicholas

KATE screams at PETER to go and find some help

KATE (CONTD)
Call somebody Peter

PETER goes running off to find his cellphone

KATE (CONTD)
Quick Hurry up Oh my God My
God no Not my little boy
Peter

PETER returns at once his phone stuck to his ear waiting
for the emergency services to answer General air of panic

KATE (CONTD)
Nicholas Open your eyes Here
Stay with me
THE SON pg108

YOUNG NICHOLAS is watching him intently You can feel the
magnitude of the effort he’s making to reach PETER It’s in

for this attempt

THE SON pg113

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Here it is

PETER
What’s this

NICHOLAS
My first novel

PETER is stunned

PETER
It you wrote this

NICHOLAS
I didn’t want to tell anyone about
it out of superstition But now it
actually exists I wanted you to
be the first person to have it

PETER reads out the title

PETER
“Death Can Wait” Fantastic When’s
it coming out

NICHOLAS
In two months And if you open it
youll see it’s dedicated to you

PETER opens the book and confirms that it is in fact
dedicated “For my father For everything he’s done for me”

PETER doesn’t say anything but it’s clear he’s swept with
strong emotions

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
So of course it talks a bit about
what you already know All those
really tough years for you and
Mom But at least it’s ended
well

PETER and NICHOLAS smile at one another

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
I wanted you to be the first person
to have it because I know that if
it wasn’t for you I couldn’t
have

PETER is overwhelmed but he’s trying not to show it
PETER

I’m so proud of you My big boy
I’m so proud of you
THE SON pg114

NICHOLAS
Better wait till you’ve read it
You might not like it

PETER
I know you I know it’1l be
beautiful And really what I want
to tell you is I’m so proud of
you

PETER looks at the young man NICHOLAS has become with pride
and emotion He’s trying to stop himself from crying

NICHOLAS
Now you’re not going to start
crying

PETER
No sorry

PETER hugs him tightly This goes on for some time

NICHOLAS
Now we just have to hope it’1l be
a success

PETER

Theo a hug I’ve missed him a lot
as well

PETER

happy to see you He’s always
talking about his big brother

NICHOLAS smiles at him But PETER holds him close for a few
more seconds

PETER (CONTD)
He’s in the bathroom

NICHOLAS sets off for the bathroom to give his little brother
a hug Suddenly BETH appears from the kitchen She looks
troubled

BETH

But PETER doesn’t answer He’s watching NICHOLAS who turns
back to him just before leaving the room They exchange a
look heavy with meaning and ambiguity What are they trying
to say to one another
THE SON

BETH (CONTD)
What are you doing Peter

BETH doesn’t understand NICHOLAS is invisible

BETH (CONTD)
