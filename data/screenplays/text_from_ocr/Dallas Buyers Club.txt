Azidothymidine or AZT -- was originally
developed as a treatment for cancer

INT DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Barrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS slick well-dressed gold
Rolex 40s stands before DR NATHAN SEVARD 50s arrogant
DR EVE SAKS early 30s sophisticated and five other
PHYSICIANS 40s-60s all members of the hospital board

RICK FERRIS
With the onset of HIV however we at
Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we
administered AZT to infected lab animals
Initial findings suggested increased CD4
counts restored T-cell immunity and also
evidence of inducing weight gain

SEVARD
Isnt it also true that it had some
concerning side effects in animal tests
significantly decreasing the animals red
and white blood cells

RICK FERRIS
Yes but its effect on the virus is
better than anything else thats been
tested

EVE
(looking into her file)
In 64 when AZT was developed for cancer
treatment it was shelved due to lack of
anti cancer efficacy and toxicity

Dallas Buyers Club Green Revision Dec 2 2012 P 8

RICK FERRIS
We believe those problems were dosage

based

EVE
So youre conducting another animal
study

RICK FERRIS
Actually the FDA has given us permission
to go straight to human trials which is
what brings me here today Were
conducting a double-blind placebo-
controlled randomized trial throughout
the United States Dallas Mercy is one
of the proposed sites

EVE
How long do you see the study going on

RICK FERRIS
Were hoping to fast track it within a
year During which time the hospital and
its administering physicians will be very
well compensated for their efforts

Eve notices as Sevard trades looks with Board Member 1

RICK FERRIS
Sadly the AIDS crisis will only get
worse before it gets better And I
know I speak for everyone at Barrow
Wilkem when I say getting this drug to
market is our number one priority This
is a unique opportunity A chance to be
on the forefront in finding a cure

Eve looks at Ferris and smiles

EVE
Does it not drive you just a little bit
crazy when these guys stand up there
talking about curing the sick while

they know about sick patients

DR SEVARD
Theyre pharma reps not doctors And
like it or not this is a business
Dallas Buyers Club Green Revision Dec 2 2012 P 8A

INT COURTROOM - SAN FRANCISCO 146

Ron dressed in a conservative suit is looking extremely ill
Next to him is David Wayne and two other younger ATTORNEYS

On the opposing side are FDA representatives including Richard
Barkley and others who we haven’t ever seen before They have
a team of four attorneys

JUDGE
The constitution specifically the ninth
amendment does not state that you have
the right to be mentally healthy or
physically healthy It does state that
you have a right to chose your own
medical care but that is interpreted as
medical care that is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration

The Judge looks over to the FDA table

JUDGE
Regarding the FDA the court is highly
disturbed by its bullying tactics and
direct interference with a drug whose own
agency has found to be non-toxic The
FDA was formed to protect people not
prevent them from getting help

The Judge sighs

JUDGE
The law does not seem to make much common
sense If a person has been found to be
terminally ill they ought to be able to
take just about any drug they feel will
help but that is not the law Mr
Woodroof there is not a person in this
courtroom who is not moved to compassion
by your plight what is lacking here is
the legal authority to intervene Im
sorry This case is hereby dismissed

The Judge bangs the gavel

David Wayne raises in frustration Ron closes his eyes
defeated

is up the bull is out and the crowd whoops it up

Rodeo contestant number “43” Ron Woodroof rides the bull his
hands legs and heels all working together His “off” hand is
held out above him cutting the air for balance

The bull makes an abrupt change of direction catches Ron off
guard and just when it seems that he’s about to be thrown in
the air we hear Eve screaming her guts out as the image
freezes on a PERFECT FRAME on this cowboy in action to control
the beast

The crowd’s CHEERS are echoing in the distance blended with
the soft strange ring that we know that only Ron could hear

And as we zoom in on the image

FADE TO BLACK
Ronald Woodroof died on September 12 1992 seven years after he
was diagnosed with the HIV virus He managed to stay alive

using unapproved drugs and was memorialized by 1000 gay men in
Dallas Texas
Dallas Buyers Club Green Revision Dec 2 2012 P 93A-95

FADE OUT
Fluconazole and Alpha Interferon are now FDA approved

DDC was approved in 1992 but is no longer used due to its
highly toxic effects

Peptide T remains unapproved but still in studies for
neurological diseases like Alzheimer

Today it is had been scientifically proven that HIV is the
cause of AIDS Based on this knowledge great strides have
been made in treating this infection with anti-HIV medications
but a cure has yet to be discovered

The first studies with AZT as a single drug (monotherapy)
while showing initial good results did not ultimately prove to
be a long term solution for HIV treatment

By 1996 medical researchers learned that HIV is best treated
with a combination cocktail of at least three HIV medications
AZT was frequently used as a part of these early combination
therapies Today AZT has been largely replaced by safer new
HIV medications
