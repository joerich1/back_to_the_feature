FADE IN

1950s SCI-FI FILM Black and white retro stilted acting
bad effects

EXT WOODSPARKING AREA - NIGHT

This is a make-out zone CAMERA MOVES to find the back of a
car where two teenagers are kissing The angle is SUPER
TIGHT the lighting dark so we CANT SEE THEIR FACES

ONE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS As we REVEAL the car the
automatic convertible top is coming down When we see the
couple inside its from behind the now scrunched rear
window The framing of the window cuts off the tops of their
heads hiding their antenna Also we see them in silhouette
so we dont see their green skin

Dialogue starts VO as CAMERA leisurely reveals the
silhouetted couple in the car

TEENAGE GIRL
Ive never gone parking before Im
really not that kind of a girl

TEENAGE BOY
Im not the kind of a guy who would
go with that kind of a girl

TEENAGE GIRL
Thats so sweet - I think

The boy leans closer getting ready to kiss her

TEENAGE BOY
Theres nothing to be scared of

And they kiss

From the distance comes a rumbling approaching fast The
car starts shaking

From the front of the car an alien ship rises up over the
cliff Its monstrously huge though a cheap-looking 50s
sci-fi model

TEENAGE GIRL
I knew this would happen if we made
out

The teens SCREAM and the car takes off
The car zooms down the empty road dodging lasers from the
alien ship

Suddenly the car grinds to a halt trapped The alien ship
is about to strike when

BLAM Its hit with one artillery round

REVEAL dozens of soldiers with tanks and artillery are in
position and ready for battle

From behind the alien ship a dozen more approach from the
sky

The hatch of the first ship opens An alien steps out

CAMERA MOVES up behind a jeep Before reaching the GENERAL
we see his AIDE from behind

AIDE
General what are your orders

Now we REVEAL the General from behind still not seeing his
antenna

GENERAL
This is a war for our world

Theres a CAMERA MOVE that circles around to the front of
the General that enables us to see his face Elaborate but
important for the FIRST REVEAL of our aliens

GENERAL (CONTD)
Kill every last alien

The frenetic glow of gunfire is reflected on the GENERAL as
we MOVE IN on his face (NOTE A main goal here is to create
a dynamic REVEAL that this is an alien This needs to be
close and come up suddenly for full impact Once we reveal
this we need to cut very quickly to the theater of aliens
watching for the full effect)

Suddenly they all start shooting as we

CUT TO

INT MOVIE THEATER - DAY

The audience watching this movie are also ALIENS with green
skin and antenna This is an alien world (now of course in
color) going through its 1950s sci-fi movie phase
They all wear 3-D glasses and jolt back in fear Some munch
pop corn girls hug their boyfriends little boys are on the
edge of their seats SOUND of the battle from the screen

We MOVE among them and come to a 9 year old boy ECKLE
Suddenly someone pulls his 3-D glasses off Its ECKLES MOM
and shes pissed She takes him by his antenna and drags him
out of there

EXT MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Eckles Mom drags her son away This begins the OPENING
CREDIT SEQUENCE In the scenes that follow titles will show
up in unlikely places billboards store signs traffic
signs etc As this introduces us to the planet well hear
a light stylized 50s SONG

We follow Eckle and his Mom until we come to a woman walking
her stroller

We then FOLLOW HER as she walks up to a crossing guard The
guard does a guchie-goo tickle as if under the babys
chin but we REVEAL the baby is an egg

They walk on and we pick up a MILKMAN and MAILMAN who greet
each other in a super friendly way

MATLMAN
Hello Plark

MILKMAN
Morning Serbok

They pass kids playing HOPSCOTCH on the street We HOLD on
them Instead of squares they jump in a pattern like a crop
circle

Nearby a beauty parlor Inside a suburban mom luxuriates
as her antenna are groomed

incredible truth

REVEAL were actually seeing

INT PLANETARIUMAUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

This is a star show in a classic 50ish planetarium Watching
the show is an auditorium full of school kids

Up from the middle of the room rises a platform containing
the star machine and its OPERATOR LEM a high-school
junior 16 passionate fairly geeky yet kind of cute for
someone with green skin Its his voice we were hearing

Hes about to continue with his lecture but hes new and
uneasy in this job He stumbles dropping his script
Bending down to pick it up he knocks the star machine
making it pivot 180 degrees sending stars flying all over
the dome

The kids OOOOH and AHHHHH loving it covering his mistake -
or so it seems But Lem looks over to an older man sitting
prominently in front This is the CURATOR He takes notes on
Lems presentation grading him From his face the grade so
far doesnt look good

From nearby Lem hears PSSSST

He turns to see SKIFF sitting nearby Lems age Skiff is
quirky paranoid He motions for Lem to keep going and gives
him an encouraging thumbs up

Lem makes himself continue He hits some buttons on the star
machine as he narrates the following

LEM
How vast is space If you could
stretch a rope from one end to the
other it would reach over 500
miles
Ooooohs from the audience

LEM (CONTD)
Ever try counting the stars Dont
bother theres too many Over ONE
THOUSAND

Even more Oooooohs from the audience Lems feeling
confident now

LEM (CONTD)
Ill bet you think stars are tiny
points of light Wrong
On the dome Lem zooms into an individual star
LEM (CONTD)
Each star is over 3 feet wide And
so hot it can boil water

The biggest set of Oooooohhhhs

Lem brings up an image of their planet struggling a bit to
shove the slide in the right slot

LEM (CONTD)

But dont worry about our planet

Its so far from the nearest star

nothing could ever happen to it
Maybe the real planet is but Lem put the slide of the
planet in wrong It starts to catch fire causing the
planets image on the dome to bust into hellish flames as if
their planet is dying
A terrified MOAN from the kids some SCREAMING and CRYING

KIDS
Were gonna dieI want mommie

Lem looks over at the Curator who shakes his head and makes
a note

CUT TO

INT PLANETARIUMAUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER
Kids are filing out

ON THE CURATOR summing up Lems score as two boys file
past He overhears
BOY 1
You see the whole world blow up

BOY 2

But the Curators not impressed

ON LEM waiting nearby for his score Eckle rushes over
speaking rapid-fire Lem is uneasy with the Curator hear
this

ECKLE
What about aliens Can they really
suck out our brains How do you
spot an alien zombie Are you in
the they dont blink school or
the show no emotion school

Eckle is interrupted as Lem covers his mouth and looks
uneasily to the curator

LEM
Hes a riot isnt he Aliens
(to Eckle condescends)
Science proves theres no aliens
(to Curator)
Too many comic books

Lem taps Eckles head to indicate brain damage The Curator
marks another box on Lems score Its not looking good

EXT PLANETARIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Lem comes outside looking glum

ON ECKLE AND SKIFF waiting for the news They exchange a
concerned look

SKIFF
Didya get the job

Suddenly Lem brightens He was misleading them
LEM
Youre looking at the new junior
assistant curator

His friends smile They walk on

CUT TO
EXT TOWN STREET - A BIT LATER

Lem Skiff and Eckle are upbeat walking walk down a
suburban street We see more of the neighborhood part of
this town

The Milkman passes by and calls

MILKMAN

MILKMAN
Knew you would

As they pass the Milkman their conversation continues

LEM
I can see my whole future A house

(confides happy)
But yes

A cop car pulls up Inside CHIEF GORLOC speaks over his
LOUDSPEAKER

CHIEF GORLOC
HEARD YOU GOT THE JOB NOW GO MARRY
THAT GIRL

Lem looks around slightly embarrassed but smiles anyway
and gives the Chief a thumbs up

LEM
Thanks Chief

The cop car pulls way REVEALING behind it the movie
marquee There we read COMING SOON HUMANIACS 3 Below
that a huge poster for the movie showing invading aliens
A banner overhead announces SIGN UP FOR THE PREMIERE

ECKLE
(in movie trailer voice)
Humaniacs 3 The final battle for
our world has begun

BOTH SKIFF AND ECKLE
Victory or extinction

They both make a high-pitched sci-fi sound Lem sees the
sign for the costume contest

LEM
If you guys go in costume Im
pretending we never met

Lem starts to walk down the street Skiff and Eckle follow

SKIFF
Wait a minute youre not going
You said Humaniacs 2 was the best
sequel since I Married My Alien
Abductor
LEM
Im a planetarium professional now
I dont have time for science
fiction And I dont believe in
aliens

SKIFF
If I didnt know better Id say you
were an alien sent to make us think
theres no aliens

LEM
Skiff

Skiff stops Lem in front of a shop so he can talk to him

SKIFF
Theyre here Lem Walking among
us Studying us using
(whispers
conspiratorial)
-the anal probe

LEM
Aliens came here to look up our
butts

Skiff puts a hand on Lems shoulder to emphasize

SKIFF
The anus is the key to everything

This is said just as a shopping woman exits a store and
winds up in the tight shot with them in time to catch this
homoerotic sentiment Her face drops

Lem walks on and Skiff and Eckle follow We leave the
shocked woman to follow them

SKIFF (CONTD)
The government knows Theyre
hiding the evidence at Base 9 Base

brain

Lem turns away and finds Eckle staring at him with an
expectant smile

LEM
Dont listen to him Theres no
such thing as aliens

CUT TO

EXT CROP CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

To contradict Lems statement we see an alien formation in
the grass

REVEAL this is actually a baseball field A game is in
progress But flying overhead unnoticed is an actual alien
ship

(NOTE I like this scene here because it feels like a
precursor to the alien arriving and also incorporates
information about their world Also Im not sure we need to
introduce Base 9 here The key information for us now is
that an alien ship is arriving Im concerned were putting
too much on our audience by introducing Base 9)

affectionately

Slowly a rumbling starts Next door still working outside
Lems parents hear it too They all wonder whats going on
Then from out of the sky comes a fiery rocket A NASA
landing module approaches and slowly lands

Pause The hatch opens Out steps an astronaut Like the
first man on the moon he charges out in self-simulated low
gravity slow-motion and plants the American flag in the
ground Then he looks around and realizes
Hes in suburbia on a strange planet

Eckles and Lems parents stare in shock Eckle realizes
its a spaceman like the kind in his comic book Beaming he
grabs a pen to get the aliens autograph

The astronaut already freaked takes a step back Through
his POV we see Eckles Dad holding the big fork with cooked
meat in a way that could be seen as hostile Then the
automatic sprinkler is triggered coming between he and his
ship Then Lems Dad inadvertently ignites his grill

sending up an scary spire of flame

The astronaut freaks turns and runs off down the street -
this just as Lem comes out in time to see him run off

the barber is heading out hastily putting on his civic
patrol uniform

Hes heading over to the civic patrol group assembling
outside also joined by a grocer from across the street
taking off his apron and trying to fit his too-tight
ammunition belt around his waste

Civic Patrol citizens gather around a CIVIC PATROL CAPTAIN

LEM
Guess I was wrong What do they

Skiff looks around secretly then shows Lem some crudely
drawn architectural plans

SKIFF (CONTD)
Im building an air raid shelter
Ill have enough food for six
months if you want to come

LEM
(yuck)
Six months underground with you

SKIFF

SKIFF
(realizes)
Oh wait I already used that one

Lem tosses the cork up like it was a hot coal
LEM
Gross

While Lem is busy with that Neera comes by

NEERA
Hey Lem Whore you talking to

Lem turns to see that Skiff has disappeared He shakes his
head

that way herself

NEERA (CONTD)

This is a huge round atrium room with a multitude of
scientific exhibits from a huge hanging mobile of planets
and stars to telescopes etc

Lem starts to prepare the place to be shut down He doesnt
notice but fairly well-hidden in one of the displays is the
NASA astronaut sleeping

MOVE IN ON THE ASTRONAUT as suddenly a light on his chest
starts to blink red just like Rovers It wakes him up He
stirs knocking over something and creating a racket

ON LEM turning wondering what happened stepping over to
investigate as

The astronaut straightens himself up and

The TWO OF THEM STAND FACE TO FACE for the first time A
frozen moment of terror Suddenly

BOTH SCREAM And run away in opposite directions
ANGLE ON EACH running away screaming The astronauts
screams are muffled inside his helmet Each knocks over

things in a panic to get away

What they dont realize is that the room is round and their
fleeing is leading them right into

Each other SMASH they crash into each other and both fall
Each sits up Each screams

They run away The astronaut winds up falling into a tangle
of mobile wires and stuck in the air as if floating in
space

Lem keeps running until he realizes hes not being chased
He turns and looks back

He sees the astronaut struggling to get free

Suddenly on the astronauts spacesuit the hose gets caught
on a wire and is pulled out

SOUND OF AIR HISSING
ON THE ASTRONAUT realizing hes in trouble He checks his
oxygen gauge Its quickly draining Now the astronaut

panics terrified

ON LEM seeing how scared he is He feels bad for it He
notices the wires and follows them to where theyre held to
a hook in the wall Lem gets an idea one thats going to
take some courage

He takes a breath and crosses to the hook He looks back at
the astronaut

LEM
Wish I had that cork

Taking a brave step he unhooks the wires The mobile wires
- and astronaut - come crashing down

The astronaut scrambles to his feet and looks at the gauge
IT READS EMPTY

Freaked choking he looks all around He has no choice He
undoes the metal lock around his helmet He turns to the
side and slowly pulls off his helmet We the face of
CAPTAIN CHARLES (CHUCK) BAKER mid-30s handsome His
cheeks are puffed as he holds his breath Finally he lets
it out and takes a scary breath To his surprise its okay

He takes another

at his own much slower pace

soldiers This is GENERAL GRAWL Towering mighty Even from
behind hes perfect every hair of his crewcut in place his
uniform sharp and crisp His walk resonates authority

Grawl suddenly stops at one soldier

ANGLE ON THAT SOLDIER not moving but registering terror
Whats he done wrong His eyes drift down over his uniform
to

horror of horrors an errant thread on his jacket His
eyes go wide

Finally we REVEAL the face of General Grawl Theres nothing
about him that isnt perfectly in place Hes handsome and
stern Burt Lancaster with antenna

GRAWL
Do you know why we call ita
uniform son

The terrified soldier shakes his head
GRAWL (CONTD)

Because when were all uniform
then we can see who the enemy is

The soldier nervously reaches down and pulls off the thread
A killer pause Grawl walks up to the CAPTAIN to get his
first look at the ship

GRAWL (CONTD)
Captain have your men search the
flying saucer

The Captain salutes and motions to soldiers in radiation
suits who approach the ship Others ready their rifles to
back them up

ON CHUCK not liking this

ON LEM trying to get back to the car finding soldiers in
his way He stops and forces a smile

ON THE SHIP as the soldiers exit with armfuls of stuff NASA
food moose hair product Vanity Fair magazine etc Theres
also an MP3 player

A soldier drops the MP3 player It starts to play Space
Oddity by David Bowie

They all run for cover A horrified pause

SONG
Ground Control to Major Tom your
circuits dead theres something
wrong Can you hear me Major Tom

Suddenly three shots are fired killing the player
REVEAL GRAWL fired the shots

GRAWL
This is worse than I thought

CAPTAIN
The music Sir

GRAWL

Thats no music I ever heard It
must be some sort of alien mind-
control Seal off the town I want
that alien pilot found

From the onlookers a voice

A VOICE
I protest
REVEAL the voice belongs to Glar Flanked by the Teens and

Neera he steps up and gives his guitar a STRUM

GLAR
Daddeo youre bumming me out with
those negative vibrations

A pause They look at Glar blankly

GRAWL
Never mind Captain the aliens
right here

Soldiers grab Glars arms Neera steps forward

NEERA
Glars not the alien

GRAWL
Oh no Then what do you call
this

Grawl holds Glars long hair

NEERA
Hair He likes it long

GRAWL
Very unusual You might even say -
very alien

The Teacher watching nearby speaks up

TEACHER
Uh General he does go to the high
school
That stops Grawl
NEERA

Glars just trying to say the
aliens might be friendly

(sees Lem)
Lem you know astronomy If an
alien came all this way wouldnt it
be smart enough to come in peace

Lem is about to answer when he notices a soldier peering
his car another reaching for the door He rushes over

LEM
Nott

in
He stands between the soldier and the door He looks around
realizes hes acting suspicious and tries to cover

LEM (CONTD)
I mean Theyre everywhere They
want our brains with hot sauce We
should all go home and hide

Eckle - standing nearby - happens to look inside and catch a
glimpse of Chuck His eyes go wide Lem gets in the car

GRAWL
Thats a sensible young man
(to soldiers)
Let him go
(to bystanders)
And the rest of you go to your
homes and wait for instructions

The soldiers let Lem drive past People start disbanding
Passing Neera Lem sees the look on her face Shes
disgusted by what he just said Lem feels horrible but with
all the soldiers there he has to drive away

He pulls the car into his garage

CUT TO

INT LEMS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The door open we see Lem sneaking Chuck upstairs and into
the room As they enter Lem goes about shutting the shades

CHUCK

LEM

From behind Lem

length mirror

CHUCK (CONTD)

fat

CUT TO

EXT SUBURBIA - CONTINUOUS
Army trucks go by Pause Rover peers around the corner

Suddenly a rock lands next to him Rover stops picks it
up examines it and grows excited Happy he stores it in
his compartment

Then another rock lands by him Rover looks up and around
Then all at once a handful of rocks comes down Rover races
to catch them all excited as can be

WE FINALLY REVEAL SKIFF coming out of a hole dug in his
yard Hes been digging an air raid shelter

Skiff carries a huge rock too big to be thrown from below
Just as hes ready to toss it Skiff sees Rover staring at
him Skiff recoils

Rover eyes the rock He really wants it He approaches
Skiff

SKIFF
Dont probe me Theres nothing up
there you wanna see

But Rover comes closer Skiff panics He winds up and tosses
the rock at him

Rover catches it and dances with excitement He holds it up
examines it savors it and finally stores it in his inner
compartment He looks back at Skiff lovingly grateful
Skiff realizes hes next Horrified expecting the worst he
runs off

INT BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
Skiff enters and closes the door behind him We dont see

where he is yet He runs right up to camera a la the end of
Invasion of the Body Snatchers He shouts

SKIFF
Theyre here Theyre here now
Cant you see Youre next

(right to camera)
YOURE NEXT

REVEAL hes inside
THE LOCAL BOWLING ALLEY Only a couple of people bowl The

rest are watching invasion news on the TV No one pays him
any attention

ANGLE ON THE DOOR as Rover enters Hes low to the ground so
no one else notices him He stops when he sees rack after
rack filled with bowling balls So many rocks He dances
with glee and turns to Skiff with love Skiff backs up in
fear

Suddenly a woman sees Rover and SCREAMS Quickly the whole
place is in a panic as people bolt for the doors

Soldiers enter Rover sees and quickly races away and hides
behind a curtain

Turns out hes hiding inside the photo booth shaking in
fear He sneaks a peak at the incoming soldiers through the
curtain and doing so accidentally turns on the machine and
gets 4 pictures taken The way he looks at the flashing
light of the photo booth it almost seems like hes posing
for them

That draws the attention of the soldiers They surround the
booth

Suddenly Rover bursts out The soldiers chase shooting
Rover ducks behind a rack of balls tossing it over to make
the soldiers scatter

Now Rover is making a dash down the lanes dodging bullets
heading for the pins A small PIECE of him is shot off and
falls on the lane

SMASH he gets a strike
The soldiers go after him but cant find him in the mess of
pins Where did he go

END ON SKIFF watching the whole thing amazed

BIG MOVE IN TO CHUCK as he dramatically realizes

CHUCK (CONTD)

Lem enters the bedroom

LEM

Chuck rises ready for action

CHUCK
Couldnt agree more Whats the
plan

LEM

The plan is you get out of my life

Well there it is

Lem opens the shade to reveal the ship Theres double the
number of soldiers around spotlights on the ship search
lights on the sky Its like his house has been placed in
the middle of a sci fi thriller

Lem closes the shade discouraged He heads off

LEM (CONTD)

furtively he rolls behind some bushes to wait

INT LEMS ROOM - A BIT LATER

Lem is making up Chucks bed as Chuck brushes his teeth with
some weird alien toothpaste The TV is on in background

CHUCK

SHOW DISSOLVES TO A CLASSROOM Students approach the
teacher

STUDENT 1
Hey Professor Kipple Whats all
this guff about aliens

ON TV REVEAL THE TEACHER PROFESSOR KIPPLE Bald and short
Though hes normally weird and perverted hes acting like
the perfect 50s authority figure here

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Why Gippy aliens arent so scary
once you understand them Hit the
lights

ON TV Kipple throws a switch for a projector Up comes a
CRUDELY ANIMATED 50ish version of aliens

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (CONTD)
Aliens are a lot like us except
for their hypodermic fingertips
spare set of teeth and beaks for
sucking brains out of their
victims heads

ANGLE ON LEM looking at Chuck suspiciously

CHUCK
What

Lem looks back at the TV

ON TV crude animation of pods a la ‘Invasion of the Body
Snatchers’

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Aliens can replicate our bodies
using an advanced technology called
pods And their huge brains have
the power to turn us into zombies

Kipple is cut off as Lem turns off the TV He crawls into
his bed

LEM
Im harboring the most wanted
fugitive in the world Yesterday my
life was all set Now - my whole
world is upside down

Chuck settles into his bed and looks up
CHUCK
At least you have a world
(realizing)
Ill probably never see mine again

From HIGH ANGLE PULL BACK on Chuck looking up higher and
higher to

with his ship About 2 days and 7 hours

DISSOLVE TO

EXT TOWN STREET - MORNING
We establish the paranoia People on the street staring each
at each other in mistrust a storekeeper whos frightened
and locking his door people afraid to meet each others
eyes

The mail truck pulls up next to a milk truck The Mailman
and Milkman get out and cross paths warily

MATLMAN
Hello Plark if thats really

MILKMAN

The Mom SCREAMS and runs from the soldiers

EXT LEM AND ECKLES STREET - CONTINUOUS

A paperboy rides his alien bike through the bright suburban
streets He tosses newspapers as he goes past the soldiers
bivouacked on the suburban lawns Finally passing Lems
house he throws the paper

We FOLLOW THE PAPER as it hits the front door and lands on
the front step Suddenly Rovers arm reaches over from the
nearby bushes and snatches it

ANGLE BEHIND THE BUSHES REVEALS ROVER holding the paper and
ducking

ON THE FRONT DOOR as Lems Dad steps out No paper Leaving
the door open he walks onto the walkway
LEMS DAD
(to himself)
Thats funny wheres the paper

When he turns back he sees the newspaper is sitting on the
front step

ANGLE BEHIND BUSHES shows Rover is no longer there
presumably inside the house now

ANGLE NEARBY as soldiers snap to extreme attention Up walks
General Grawl

IN THE BACKGROUND soldiers keep working around the ship
Some in radiation suits examine the planted American Flag
with their version of Geiger Counters

Grawl reaches the Captain

CAPTAIN
No trace of the alien sir

GRAWL
How can something so different hide
in all this beautiful sameness

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (0S)
I can answer that General

Through the throng of soldiers Professor Kipple approaches
They step back All know and respect him

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (CONTD)
By using its enormous brain to
control our thoughts Even YOU
could be an alien zombie and not
know it

GRAWL
Good point Professor
(to Captain offers
sidearm)
Captain place me under arrest

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
No need for that But we cant be
sure of anything For all we know
that flag could be a doomsday
device Pull it out of the ground
our whole world could vaporize

ANGLE ON THE FLAG The soldiers with Geiger Counters have
found it clean and backed away as another soldier has just
begun to pull it out of the ground Hearing Kipple he
stops

The soldier smiles uneasily and furtively slips the flag
back

GRAWL
What do we do

ON KIPPLE this is what hes been leading up to

PROFESSOR KIPPLE

Capture the alien - alive - and
bring it to me

(hungrily)
I will unlock the secrets of its
brain

Grawls hand reaches in offering a handkerchief

GRAWL
Here Professor you were drooling

A jeep drives up and screeches to a halt in front the
General A soldier jumps out and salutes

SOLDIER
We detained the witnesses at the
bowling alley And we found this

He hands Grawl the PHOTO BOOTH PICTURES OF ROVER Grawl and
Kipple exchange a look

backs up

SKIFF
Youre not Lem Youre a replicant

Such an obvious fake Whatve you

LEM
(eyes windows nervously)
You gotta keep it down

Rover sidles up to Skiff and nuzzles him Skiff is scared at
first but he stops and looks at Rovers cute face Rovers
one eye blinks so adorably as he tilts his head like a dog
Skiff melts

SKIFF
Its kinda cute the way he does
that

Lem jumps on the opportunity to calm Skiff down

LEM
Look at his face Is that the face
of evil

SKIFF
(softening)
I dont think so

LEM
Of course not They need our help
They just wanna go home

Skiff slowly reaches out and pets Rover Rover sidles up
affectionately

SKIFF

Suddenly another knock at the door Lem has had it
LEM

Suddenly they see Chuck and aim their files fumbling
nervous They enter

SOLDIER 1 (CONTD)
Whatta we do

SOLDIER 2

soldiers making a high-pitched sci-fi HUMMING SOUND

CHUCK (CONTD)

Lem holds his head in mock fear

LEM

Chuck reaches out and puts a hand on each of the soldiers

heads He speaks like Spock The MUSIC becomes Star Trek-
like

CHUCK

Spock

The soldiers exchange a confused look but obey

Chuck pulls Lem aside near the window

CHUCK (CONTD)
Maybe they can get me on my ship

Lem looks outside The place is swarming with soldiers

LEM
Too many soldiers
Then Lem spots the TV crew outside A lightbulb moment

LEM (CONTD)
But I have another idea Youre

them your friendly But first we

Lem spots the mind-controlled soldiers and realizes how

EXT LEMS HOUSEGARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The door opens automatically revealing an army jeep The
mind-controlled soldiers are in the front seat Lem and
Skiff in the backseat Chuck and Rover hidden under the
backseat

As the jeep starts up Eckle climbs in

LEM
Go home Eckle

But Chuck reaches out and positions Eckle as a shield to
hide behind

CHUCK

The jeep slowly pulls out past many soldiers who have to
step out of the way Very tense Finally they pass the
soldiers and takes off

emergency

Skiff snatches the toy from Chuck

He points to a Hisk at the far end of the room standing by
an electric console

GRAWL (CONTD)

THING TO WASTE - MAKE LOVE NOT INTERSTELLAR WAR

They chant

his neck Hes starting a song similar to Times Are A
Changing

GLAR
Now come all you aliens dont be
afraid Your welcome we still are
arranging We used to think youre

chain He presses it causing the roof overhead to split and
start to open revealing the sky above A beautiful moment
They all look up thrilled

Some affectionate chucks on the shoulder for Eckle

CHUCK

THROUGH GRAWLS POV his scope on Chucks head we SUDDENLY
SEE LEM STEP IN FRONT

Lem approaches the General gingerly trying to have a heart
to heart talk As he talks he gets closer and closer

LEM

General I know what youre afraid
of I understand Im afraid of it

aliens or monsters Its something
even scarier Its the unknown
Ive spent my whole life running
from it And I think maybe you have
too But the unknown isnt
something to be afraid of

(with a smile at Chuck)
It can be your best friend

(to Grawl)
And just when you think it means
the end of everything you know

(a sly look at his team)
Its really just the beginning

Lem suddenly grabs the REMOTE BASE DESTRUCT DEVICE and
presses the red button

A frozen moment Grawl stares in disbelief Lem cant even
believe it And suddenly

THE BASE ALARM SOUNDS They hear

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE

The soldiers all stare in horror They exchange looks Lem
turns to Kipple

right at Lem

Lem floats to the window where he looks out at the view of
a lifetime Chuck floats next to him
