EXT SAINT FRANCIS HOTEL SAN FRANCISCO NIGHT

We open inside a NEWS VAN Four monitors show different
competing feeds A waiting reporter Color Bars A political
commercial One monitor is cueing up a debate clip

A light pops on the reporter and he springs to life

TV REPORTER

Yes we learned just a few minutes
ago that Senator Hart will soon be
leaving this hotel back to the
convention hall where he will
concede -- yes he will concede --
to former vice president Walter
Mondale Hart won every state --

We pull out to reveal a PRODUCER hovering over an ENGINEER

PRODUCER
His hair looks like shit When’s he
getting it cut

ENGINEER
That is the new cut
(shakes his head)
We can’t get a clear line

PRODUCER
Are we at full stick

The producer pops her head out to check the dish We tilt up
to see people watching from above as the dish slowly rises

We pan to find the blown-dry reporter Beyond him is another
NEWSMAN delegates protestors cops etc

TV REPORTER
-- West of the Mississippi River in
this fight for the Democratic
nomination But in the end it was
Mondale’s taunting question taken
from a Wendy’s advertisement that
dogged his insurgent campaign

PRODUCER HART (0C)

Roll tape Go I think the dedication of our
party to minority people in
the South
Yellow Rev 2

We push back into the van to see ACTUAL FOOTAGE - WALTER
MONDALE at a debate with Hart

MONDALE
I hear your new ideas I’m reminded
of that ad - Wheres the beef
A ROAR of laughter and applause as Hart tries to be heard

HART (0C)

PRODUCER
Ok go Steve

REPORTER (0C)

ENGINEER

REPORTER PRODUCER

(continuing unbeknownst)
Share his thoughts with the
many thousands of voters and
activists who fought hard
these last months

The fuck is going on up
there Talk to me Are we
facing south

(peering up at the roof)
Steve would you shut up We
lost the signal again

ENGINEER (CONTD)
I think were facing South
Supposed to be south yes

PRODUCER
Well maybe you should invest ina
god damn compass

REPORTER
(continuing unbeknownst)
Senator Hart broke from
relative obscurity when he
took the New Hampshire
primary

We pop back outside the news

PRODUCER (CONTD)
Would someone tell him to
shut the fuck up No one’s
listening Ah what’s the
point

van to find a couple guys well

come to know as STRATTON and WILSON Smoking cigarettes
Yellow Rev 3

STRATTON
- Guy just tried to pin my lapel
Didn’t even ask

WILSON
How far are we from the O’Farrell
Theater Just curious

They cross the street through traffic Stratton tells a story
about losing the tip of his finger while starting a golf cart
as a young staffer

We boom up and find a THIRD FLOOR WINDOW A guy we’ll come to
know as EMERSON is sitting on the sill He’s wearing a WHITE
ELECTION HAT It reads “HART” He takes it off examines it
one last time then tosses it down to the street below

INT VIP SUITE ST FRANCIS HOTEL CONTINUOUS

Stratton and Wilson enter the room still jawing The staffers
were cute on the McGovern campaign

We pan to find a guy we’ll come to know as BROADHURST He’s
smoking in the bathroom with a attractive female staffer

BROADHURST
You can’t even imagine There
ain’t nothing like sleeping on the
open ocean darling

We find Emerson grabbing a drink at a small wet bar It’s a
mixed crowd Staffers and donors The mood is low key but
people still mingle

EMERSON
What’s the plan for after

STRATTON
Can we hold off the ‘88 talks for
just a moment

EMERSON
I meant drinks

STRATTON
Oh the Hawaiian place

WILSON
It’s Polynesian

We move through bodies to find GARY HART sitting on an aging
sofa PHONE and a VODKA finishing up the worst phone call
you can make in politics
Yellow Rev 4

HART
(cradling a corded phone)
Yeah OK I appreciate it Walter

His wife and college sweetheart LEE wipes an eye and holds
his arm He makes meaningful eye contact with BILL DIXON

Nearby are his son and daughter JOHN and ANDREA
HART (CONT’D)
(to his wife Lee quietly)

I’1l come with you back to Denver

LEE
You should stay

Nearby JOHN EMERSON chats up BILLY SHORE about the Russian
Olympic boycott

Stratton checks his watch and shows Shore the time He nods
Wilson pulls out speech and checks it one last time

Stratton and Shore approach the sofa where Hart sits

STRATTON

WILSON SHORE
(to Hart) (to Wilson)
Remember to hit homelessness Doug Come on

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The team moves through heartbroken supporters offering ad
libbed “Dont leave stay in it” A couple secret
service agents push through as PHOTO FLASHES POP

Wilson continues to remind about policy

SHORE
We promised homeless to Mondale

WILSON
People are homeless The name of
the issue is “homelessness”

STRATTON
(struggling)
Come on clear a path
WILSON
(to Hart)
And Perestroika

SHORE
It’s a marker for 88

HART
(to Wilson)
Homeless and Russians got it

Suddenly COMMOTION A woman screams The secret service
agents RUSH at Hart pushing him back towards the suite

STRATTON
What the fuck is --

Other agents converge on a man For a moment we see an ARM
WITH A GUN being held up in the air

AGENT
Active shooter Active shooter

LEE
Oh God What

The agents move like a scrum pushing them back into

INT VIP SUITE ST FRANCIS HOTEL CONTINUOUS

away to reveal him doubled over clutching his side

SHORE

Lee gets down on her knees to help but Hart rears up
LAUGHING hysterically barely able to breathe

LEE
Gary

But he can’t stop laughing After a long beat
HART
Who shoots the loser
INT TRADER VICS SAN FRANCISCO - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

HART
We’ve been through that It’s a
good plan It was a good plan

Reveal we are watching from another table over the shoulders
of a younger generation of reporters

HART (CONTD)

reasons

We find Hart and Woodward now at the bar sharing whiskeys

WOODWARD
-- She’d have won you New Jersey
if you hadn’t made that dumbass
crack about the water

HART
No one’s got a sense of humor
anymore

WOODWARD

Fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke
(beat while he drinks)
How’s Lee doing

HART
She needs a rest

WOODWARD
Mondale did you a favor Reagan’s
going to crush him
Yellow Rev 8

INT BEDROOM GEORGETOWN EARLY MORNING

Tammy Faye Bakker cries through runny mascara on CNN -
“Charges expected in Bakker Family Scandal”

The room is dark but we find Gary’s legs on the edge of his

TAMMY FAYE

Gary stands and leaves

INT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM WASHINGTON
A debate between GARY HART and BOB DOLE is in full swing

HART
President Reagan has allowed our
cities to decay while he buys
enough warheads to destroy the
planet 30 times over

(MORE)
Yellow Rev 9

HART (CONTD)
Imagine if every library could have
a computer Every school Every
home

DOLE
Why don’t we just buy everyone a
microwave And a television set
while we’re at it

HART
I’m interested in educating the
next generation not entertaining
them

MODERATOR
This is beginning to sound like a
campaign debate Did either of
you want to announce something

Light laughter and clapping from the audience Young people
are clearly charmed by Hart’s charisma

In the wings we find Billy Shore four years older He’s
watching and nodding ALAN WEINBERG approaches with a smile

WEINBERG
Mr Billy Shore what’s the story

SHORE
It’s not going to happen today
Alan But keep asking

WEINBERG
You hear Sonny Bono announced He’s
running for mayor of Palm Springs

SHORE
Come on I can guess his slogan

They both stumble some sort of “Hes got you babe”

Ain’t gonna hold twenty-five lines

Mid-way through the room 50 or so VOLUNTEERS and STAFFERS
are gathered in a circle rapt with DIXON campaign manager

DIXON
These other candidates they’re all
decent guys They all want the best
for this country But they are Not
Going To Win You know it they
know it most importantly George
Bush knows it That’s why they’re
all gunning for us We don’t win
this primary kiss the White House
good bye And kiss your future
goodbye Because and I don’t know
how the hell this happened but
damn near all of you in here are
younger than me So it is truly
your future that is at stake here

The phone tech continues to pry ceiling tiles loose using a
staple gun to drop phone cord from the ceiling

MODERATOR (ON TV)
They call you and some of your
younger colleagues the Atari
Democrats

HART (ON TV)
Ive heard I didn’t coin that

MODERATOR (ON TV)
Have you played Atari

HART (ON TV)
I tried Asteroids with my son a few
times I mostly drifted around
getting pelted with rocks Felt
like my first term in the senate

KELLY WILSON
Use line four (watching the TV)
How does he look that good

Swing back to Dixon building with steam withe volunteers

DIXON
So when you’re tired and your feet
hurt and your hands are freezing
because you’ve been knocking on
doors in Nashua for twelve straight
hours When you miss your
boyfriends and girlfriends your
kids When you’re tired of eating
leftovers because we don’t pay you
jack shit you think about the
opportunity we have right now and
the cost to this great country if
we squander it The future of this
country is in your hands That’s no
exaggeration It’s in your hands
Hold it carefully

INT THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM CONTINUOUS
The newsroom’s humming as Hart’s debate continues on TV

BEN BRADLEE’s office where the legendary editor seated
behind his desk with Watergate-era photos behind him is
meeting with about 7 editors and reporters

In the room are ANN DEVROY (30s the political editor)
DAVID BRODER (50s the chief political correspondent) BOB
WOODWARD (40s reporter of Watergate fame) BOB KAISER (40s
national editor) and AJ PARKER from earlier

BRADLEE
Let’s assume Cranston’s out Who’re
we missing

BRODER
If Cranston doesn’t know he’s out
someone better tell him

Devroy looks at the TV part distracted part annoyed

DEVROY
Gore’s looking at it
Yellow Rev KAISER BRADLEE
Al Gore Is he old enough

DEVROY (CONTD)
He’s 38 I think

BRODER

His daddy could win him the South
KAISER

Have you seen the wife Tipper
BRODER

And Dukakis maybe
BRADLEE

Who
BRODER

Governor of Massachusetts

BRADLEE
Du-ka-kis That’s not going to look
good on a campaign poster

KAISER
Add a “K” He could win the South

Bradlee watches Hart on TV for a moment Parker notices

PARKER
Gallop’s got Hart beating Bush by
twelve

BRADLEE

Twelve Jesus Woodward you know
the guy What do you think

WOODWARD
Gary Hart He could win it I mean
he’s got the hair

DEVROY
How many points you think the hair
is worth

BRADLEE
Six points Four if it’s windy

Laughter as we hear from the TV
Yellow Rev DOLE
I think its a little lofty for
Senator Hart to be discussing our
grand future without crediting
President Reagan with the reforms
were seeing in the Soviet Union

HART
We didnt bankrupt the Soviets
Communism bankrupted itself
morally and economically You dont
get credit for kicking down a door
thats already open

Applause Hart smiles at Dole who kind of smiles
There’s genuine camaraderie amongst these men

INT HART CAMPAIGN OFFICE DENVER CONTINUOUS
The campaign team sits in folding chairs

KELLY
Ribbon-cutting at the end of the
week and then a run-through of the
grand announcement six thousand
feet above sea level at Red Rocks

SWEENEY
Has anyone been able to move him
off this weird mountain man thing

EMERSON
He’s entrenched

WILSON
Technically he can’t be entrenched
if he’s on top of a mountain

DIXON
There’s a long storied history of
announcing one’s candidacy in a
drab shit colored ballroom with
electricity and lights

SWEENEY
And elevators

KELLY
Has anyone told him we can’t drop
balloons from a mountain

STRATTON
Maybe we can rent a plane

back

Yellow Rev 14

Wilson continues to watch Hart on TV enamored

WILSON
We didn’t prep any of this He’s
just shooting from the hip

Dixon gets the attention of a young female staffer GINNY
TERZANO He motions for a coffee She nods and walks off

KELLY
She’s not the one who gets the
coffee

SWEENEY

We’ll need water for the press
Maybe oxygen

EMERSON
And beer

STRATTON
Good luck I moved two weeks ago
and still can’t find a decent
package store

DIXON
Okay come on let’s focus Please

KELLY
We’ve got a down weekend in Miami

An exchanged glance over this

WILSON
(turning to Stratton)
You haven’t found the one on
Wynkoop Right around the corner

STRATTON EMERSON
(to Emerson) I’1l put together some local
Doesnt it close at like 5 party leaders out of Fort
Lauderdale
DIXON

We’re not doing that

EMERSON
We’re not getting endorsements

DIXON
Were not filling up photo albums
with people who’1l think we owe
them something

SWEENEY
(to Dixon surprised)
Youre going to Miami

KELLY
Billy B Broadhurst not Shore

SWEENEY
Damn there’s a lot of Billy’s
around here

DIXON
I’m Bill Only an 8-year-old should
be called Billy

STRATTON
What is Billy B’s exact position on
this campaign

DIXON
He’s a Louisiana lobbyist His
chief contribution to the political
process seems to be gumbo and
bourbon

EMERSON
And dirty jokes He makes the
senator laugh

KELLY
Last week in April we kick off and
hit the road starting with a grip
and greet in Kansas
Yellow Rev SWEENEY
Kansas is a go
DIXON
We think Kansas is a go
SWEENEY
He’1l actually talk about his
parents
DIXON

He finds the subject irrelevant

WILSON
How Everyone’s got parents
It’s relatable

DIXON
That he was born

SWEENEY
This isn’t four years ago He’s up
by twelve points People are
going to want to know him

KELLY
Is the senator comfortable
“sharing”

DIXON

I’ve never met a man more talented
at untangling the bullshit of
politics into something anyone can
understand It’s a gift - That he
wants to share And all people want
is him to pose for a stupid photo
He will never understand that

Everyone digests this Terzanno returns with coffee

KELLY
After Miami it’s up to New York
for the newspaper publishers

SWEENEY
Speaking of What am I telling
People

DIXON
People is not a newspaper

SWEENEY
It’s circulation is thirty million
I think it counts

Yellow Rev 17

DIXON
If you run covers about the sexiest
man alive you’re not a newspaper

INT BEN BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST CONTINUOUS
ON THE TV -- CHEERS for Hart

KAISER
He ever find the beef

WOODWARD
Uh yeah he wrote a pamphlet on it -
Reform Hope and the Human Factor
(adding)
It’s 94 pages

KAISER DEVROY
Some pamphlet (looking over at the TV)
What about his marriage

More CHEERS from the TV as Devroy annoyed now reaches over
and turns the volume OFF We still SEE but can’t HEAR Hart

KAISER
I heard she looks the other way

BRODER
Sounds pretty ideal to me

BRADLEE
Sounds like a zipper story

DEVROY
What is the candidate’s position on
zippers

WOODWARD

He prefers them open

BRADLEE
Bob weren’t you two roommates at
one point

WOODWARD
When Lee kicked him out a few years
back he crashed on my couch

DEVROY
And
Yellow Rev WOODWARD
And anything that happens on my
sectional sofa is irrelevant

DEVROY
AJ says the trail reporters are
obsessed with it

BRADLEE
Mr Parker Is that right

PARKER
(stepping forward now)
Just a lot of stories circulating

BRADLEE
Such as

PARKER
I heard one when I was in Dallas
Someone saw Hart go up to his hotel
room with this blonde heiress after
a fund-raiser

BRADLEE
Hm When I was on trail we were
fucking each other not writing
about it

PARKER
I’m married

BRADLEE
Good luck with that

DEVROY
Should we follow up

BRADLEE
It’s gossip Do you know how many
members of congress I mean wed
have to expel half the senate

BRODER
And you wouldn’t be thrilled with
who was left

DEVROY
I’m not thrilled now

Yellow Rev INT HART CAMPAIGN OFFICE DENVER CONTINUOUS

Where Hart is still giving his speech on the TV Wilson
mostly paying attention and the rest of them mostly not

DIXON
Why do they need three hours to
take a picture

SWEENEY
That’s just what they do It’s the
cover of People

EMERSON
And they want Gary and Lee

SWEENEY
They call me every day and they’re
not the only ones I need to know
what the plan is here

DIXON
As in

SWEENEY
There’s a ton of interest in the
separations the getting back
together Wouldn’t hurt us to put
them both out there Together

DIXON
What are you talking about

SWEENEY
The state of things I mean
Are we talking about I don’t know
whatever their arrangement

DIXON
Arrangement - Did you really just
say that out loud

SWEENEY
People want to know the Harts They
want to see them walking their dog
pumping gas being regular people

DIXON
He’s not a regular person He’s the
next fucking president of the
united fucking states

Yellow Rev 24
A large sign reads - “HART FOR PRESIDENT NEW IDEAS” We SEE
assembled staff and supporters cheering and whistling

Hart tries to cut the ribbon twice but the scissors are too
small and dull He smiles gamely

HART
Well this isn’t much of an omen

Amid the LAUGHTER Shore appears to hand Lee a larger pair of
scissors which she hands to Hart

LEE
To second tries

Raucous LAUGHTER as Hart finally cuts the ribbon

INT HART CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - THIRTY MIN LATER

Quieter now as Hart moves briskly from cubicle to cubicle
accompanied by Dixon and Shore meeting the STAFF

We see dozens of young people at desks folding tables
cubicles -- trying to look busy as they wait eagerly for
Senator Hart to say hello to them As he lets go of a YOUNG
WOMAN’s hand moves on to the next --

DIXON
This is Joe Trippi Senator He’s
handling mail

HART
Hi Joe

EXT RED ROCKS STATE PARK COLORADO MIDDAY

Gary Lee and the campaign trudge up a dusty hill under the
hot sun The wind WHIPS around them audibly obscuring some
of the dialog which is rushed and sometimes overlapping

DIXON

Can you run this much cable

STRATTON
We’ll use a mult box

DIXON
How much higher are we going

The altitude is brutal on all of them but the Harts

HART
Just a little bit further

STRATTON

make brutal shadows I’d like to
shade him somehow for the cameras

Dixon pulls Hart away a couple steps

DIXON (CONT’D)
Is all of this really necessary
Brown Palace has a perfectly fine
ballroom

HART
Dix You know what brought me to
Colorado originally
(Dixon doesn’t know)
The railroad I spent a summer
hammering railroad ties Can you
imagine

DIXON
I actually can

HART
You know the last time a democratic
president came out of the west

DIXON
Never

HART
Exactly The west is the future It
always has been And it still is

OFF Hart hair whipping in the wind moving back to his
podium spot Dixon watching him amongst the grandeur of the

Lee recedes with her staff as aides bicker over where Hart
should stand Someone mindlessly fixes his hair

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN DAY
SILENCE except for the sound of the GULLS softly cawing

The sun reflects off the ocean It’s as peaceful as the last
scene was hectic We linger on the water for several seconds
seeing and hearing no one

Then we realize our POV is Hart’s POV

In a a tee-shirt and shorts and dark shades he leans on the
HOTEL BALCONY RAILING and stares out over the ocean He’s so
relaxed we barely recognize him

EXT TURNBERRY ISLE PIER MIAMI AFTERNOON

Hart drifts aimlessly down the pier with BILLY BROADHURST
early 50s a Southern raconteur

BROADHURST
He says Billy B for that I will
trade you the car and the crawfish
I took that deal I took it
(laughing)
There it is up ahead

We SEE a YACHT with a dozen people milling around on deck
drinking We HEAR strains of Miami Sound Machine

BROADHURST (CONTD)
Belongs to a guy named Soffer Real

EXT ABOARD THE MONKEY BUSINESS NIGHT

A PARTY AT SEA It’s LOUD and Hart and Broadhurst are

ARMANDT
Wow Like in Florida
Yellow Rev 30

Broadhurst leans into Hart He points at a couple rich guys
across the way asking if Hart wants to meet them

HART
Not interested

An attractive 29 year old blonde joins the group She
whispers something in Armandt’s ear This is DONNA RICE

Rice introduces herself but Hart can barely hear her name

EXT RED ROCKS STATE PARK COLORADO DAY

For a moment we see a caravan of reporters hiking up to the
press conference as they struggle to breath

Ideas have power Ideas are what
governing is all about

TIME CUT - A CAMERAMAN is on his knees in the orange dust a
massively heavy camera slung on his shoulder

We see Parker taking notes Fielder a couple rows back Hart
stands without podium framed by the majestic rocks

HART (CONTD)
We are running for the highest and
most important office in the land

We find Emerson Shore and Stratton in a heated discussion

EMERSON

It is your job specifically to
convince the senator not to do
things exactly like this

SHORE
What exactly do you want me to say
Yellow Rev 31

EMERSON
That he’s going to look like an
idiot or worse kill somebody
What the fuck is an axe throwing
contest anyway

WILSON
I believe they call it Timbersport

STRATTON
I can look into light weight axes

WILSON
Like for children

SHORE
Roosevelt was an outdoorsman He
killed a grizzly once
(aside)
You know that’s where teddy bears
came from

EMERSON
Fuck off

WILSON
He’s correct

SHORE
It’s true Teddy Roosevelt killed a
giant bear and they commemorated it
by making plush toys for children
It was a national sensation

STRATTON
Maybe he’d settle for log rolling

EMERSON
How will they commemorate Gary Hart
impaling a lumberjack

SHORE
Might play well with the far left

MCDANIEL

home after thirty years

SWEENEY

The Senator has very fond memories
of Kansas He cannot wait

MCDANTEL
No one has fond memories of Kansas

We find Dixon Germond Broder and Wyman playing cards We’re
watching them from behind the economy curtain In the BACK
with most of the REPORTERS Parker watches carefully

An ORANGE enters foreground A Sharpie scrawls a message on
the peel After a big windup Weinberg rolls the orange up
the aisle of the plane It disappears into the front cabin

A few REPORTERS cheer in their seats We notice TOM FIEDLER
early 30s and nerdy among them He feels on the outside

FIELDER
What’d you write on it

WEINBERG
I asked where the goddamn food is

SHANAHAN
Good I’m starving What do they
have in Kansas Hardys

WEINBERG

Parker looks up to first class He sees Germond Broder and
Wyman leaving the front section and heading back

Billy picks up the ORANGE Shows it to Hart He smiles

bus had a flat outside Dubuque

Parker is watching Hart chuckle in response when Sweeney
arrives at his seat

SWEENEY

youre ready

Parker practically hops out of his seat
Yellow Rev 33

WEINBERG
Go get’em tiger

FIEDLER NOTICES and pulls Sweeney into the galley

FIEDLER
Hey when can I get some face time
with the Senator

SWEENEY
Well do a presser in Kansas

FIEDLER
I mean one on one

SWEENEY
We’re not doing that this time

FIEDLER
(motions to Parker)
What do you call that

SWEENEY
The Washington Post

Sweeney keeps moving as Fiedler takes this in

Just then Weinberg notices the orange a few feet away
tumbling back down the aisle He reaches out and grabs it

We see the words written on the orange in all caps “HAVE AN
ORANGE - GARY”

INT HART CAMPAIGN PLANE FIVE MINUTES LATER

Off the flipping of a NOTEPAD we find Hart and Parker facing
each other in the front with Sweeney watching carefully

PARKER
But you think the president hasnt
gone far enough

HART
I know he hasn’t I know Gorbachev
too don’t forget

PARKER
What can we do Aside from
negotiate more reductions
Yellow Rev 34

HART
There won’t be any peace dividend
if we don’t meet Gorbachev more
than halfway I’d invite him to my
inauguration

PARKER
(doubtful)
The Soviet premier

HART
Sure Why wouldn’t he come Why
wouldn’t we show him democracy in
action We need to be bolder

PARKER
You really think that might lay the
groundwork for more negotiations

HART
Groundwork The groundwork is laid

A BUMP OF TURBULENCE rocks the cabin for a moment Gary
casually catches his drink Parker grabs his armrests

HART (CONTD)
(calming)
It’s just wind

PARKER
Yeah uh huh

A few more bumps Parker doesn’t love it

HART
Close your eyes
(off Parker’s reluctance)
Seriously

Parker finally shuts his eyes

HART (CONTD)
Were driving down a country road

The cabin jostles again

HART (CONTD)
See We hit a few bumps Truck
keeps going You’ve been doing this
your whole life Some roads aren’t
paved That’s all

The plane settles Parker opens his eyes
Yellow Rev 35

PARKER
(embarrassed)
Thank you

HART
You got it So the Soviets are in
an economic tailspin but change
has to be managed Otherwise you’1l
get a power vacuum in Asia and the
MidEast You know what fills
vacuums

PARKER
Human nature

HART
Exactly Wars Dictators Religious

PARKER

Thats your view of human nature

Didn’t they teach you Tolstoy at

PARKER

Hart kind of notices his guys grumbling Lee brightens

LEE
(prompting)
Remember George used to sit out
here all day

HART
Of course Whenever I got home
my granddad would always be sitting
here on the front porch with a
Bible open in his lap Every day
One time a neighbor asks him just
to be friendly “What are you doing
up there” Grandad says “Cramming

Lee and the reporters laugh More photos Hart turns and
gives a reluctant smile

It’s a 30-minute delay guys Go

Stratton walks back towards Wilson and Emerson

EMERSON
It’s a travesty

WILSON
A designer suit

EMERSON
It’s not about the suit It’s the
presentation of things

STRATTON
What’s this

WILSON
Ralph Lauren announced they’re
doing wardrobe for CBS News

STRATTON
You prefer Hugo Boss

EMERSON
There’s that word - Wardrobe Like
they’re on Threes Company

STRATTON
It is a television show

EMERSON
No it’s the news A bad suit
should mean something It’s
trustworthy

We see Hart hits a key on the phone and holds it up

And everyone says - Dont they look
nice - Pretty soon Vidal Sassoon is

Maybe some music

EMERSON
Sure Mark Knopfler’s writing some
opening theme song and they‘1l1 have
action shots of the anchors leaping
away from fires and pulling kittens
out of storm drains

STRATTON
Hey maybe they don’t even need to
read the news

EMERSON
Fuck why have newsmen at all
Let’s just hire models and teach
them to read You know someone you
can really jerk off to

EXT NORTH COUNTRY NEW HAMPSHIRE DAY
Two strong hands yank the ax out of the log

A burly LUMBERJACK hands the LARGE AXE to Hart who wears a
flannel shirt and jeans

The crowd whispers in anticipation

Quick shot of a gaggle of reporters Parker among them
snickering skeptically Fiedler from the Miami Herald lifts
a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL towards Parker

FIEDLER
Ten bucks says he misses

PARKER
I’m alright thanks

Fiedler shrugs Suit yourself
Quick POP of Sweeney head in hands
EMERSON
This is a first He might just
actually throw away his campaign I
can’t fucking watch this

Shore munching on an apple looks on with detachment

Hart smiling lifts the ax over his head and hurls with all
his might It travels 25 feet and - THWACK A dead bulls-eye

Even the reporters CHEER as Hart lifts his arms above his
head and grins triumphantly

Parker gives Fiedler a little nod Shore looks at Emerson

Gary starts working his way through a line of WOODSMEN eager
to shake his hand particularly after that throw However
there’s a few dissenters including one particularly ANGRY
WOODSMAN who keeps his hands in his pockets

ANGRY WOODSMAN

Just keep your hand out of my
pocket

HART
What was that

ANGRY WOODSMAN
Taxes are high enough Keep your
hand out of my pocket
The woodsman begins to walk away Hart kind of smiles
HART
So are we going to talk or are you

just going to walk away

sheepish Hart is unflinching

Chuckles around the room

So where should we start

Note in this scene questions will come from the crowd We
won’t see each person talk The group is speaking as a whole
Yellow Rev 43

HUNTER 1
What are we supposed to ask

HART
Let’s talk about anything you want

We find the campaign team on the side visibly nervous

Chuckles around

Not so much When I was a kid my
uncle taught me to track bears

This calms the room a bit for a beat

What about Mexicans

HART
What about them

HUNTER 5
They’re taking our jobs
Yellow Rev HART
(thinks for a moment)
You think they want to leave their
lives behind Their families

Would you

HUNTER 3
They’1l work for nothing

HART
That’s why we need to invest in
Mexico

HUNTER 2
You want to buy a jalapeno farm

HART
Is that what you do You’re a
farmer

HUNTER 2
I make chairs

HART

(riffing)
So why don’t we invest in their
enterprise Their industry Create
opportunity for Mexicans in Mexico
Instead of stealing your jobs
they’1l buy your chairs

HUNTER 5
They’re not very good chairs

HART

Well I can’t help him with that

(a thought)
I mean forget jobs for a second
think about security You really
want a chaotic nation on the brink
of economic collapse just south of
the border

HUNTER 2
Sounds like Massachusetts

Real laughter

So you anti-military or something

HART
Why do you say that

Yellow Rev HUNTER 4
You’re a democrat

entire book on military reform
Sold twelve copies I don’t suppose
anyone here read it

Any of you guys

Sheepish looks amongst his team Wilson raises his hand

WILSON

flying over the Superbowl

But let’s face it we’re building a
military that’s only good at
bombing And after twenty years of
bombing you know what we’1l be
left with

He looks around the room genuinely open for an answer

HART (CONT’D)
Rubble Rubble that we’ll need to
rebuild And people who hate us
But we won’t have a conventional
military ready to fight in the
jungles and deserts where they hate
us the most

HUNTER 1
Nuke ‘em
HART
Okay Sure Who you going to nuke
(long beat)

The cold war is over and our
addiction to oil is going to take
us into battles we don’t know how
to fight in places like the middle
east where stateless Islamic
terrorism will become an epidemic

HUNTER 4
I’m not worried about some ragheads
in the desert

yourself why

The mail clerk an old guy with a limp wheels his mail cart
past the desk and stops

FIEDLER (CONT’D)
Thanks Earl

He stares at the sheet Fiedler’s brain clicks He starts
walking We follow Fiedler to Murphy’s desk

MURPHY

FIEDLER

something

HAMBURGER He’s using a RULER as a spatula and a flattened
ball of lined paper as a BURGER

HART

STRATTON

Others from the team chime in

WILSON

healthcare farming subsidies

STRATTON

INT TRUCK STOP NORTHEAST - DAY

PARKER
Just about

HART
You read the book yet

PARKER

Parker looks down at his notepad A series of questions have
been crossed off One word remains - “Marriage”

PARKER (CONTD)
(visibly uncomfortable)
Can we talk about your separation

Sweeney looks up

HART
It’s a fairly common occurrence
Id avoid it if you can

PARKER
I’m not having fun asking about
this In case you were wondering

HART
I wasn’t

HART (CONTD)
Why should anyone care How is it
relevant

PARKER SWEENEY

Yellow Rev HART (CONTD)
People Who are these ‘people’
everyone keeps telling me about

PARKER
Fine maybe we feel that way

HART
So reporters

PARKER SWEENEY
Some of us AJ either ask something
else

HART (CONTD)
Some of you who were in high school
when I ran McGovern’s campaign
It’s not my fault you’re just
arriving at the party

PARKER
OK so around that time you told
Gail Sheehy you believed in “reform
marriage” What did that mean

HART
For crying out loud I was young
and tired and living across the
country from my wife and I made a
stupid joke You know this is why
people don’t want to be in public
life Because someone will dredge
up something you said in a moment
15 years ago and act like it
somehow encapsulates your life

PARKER
It’s just --

HART
I’m going to answer one more of
these and then I’m not going to
sit here anymore We’ve covered all
the stuff that matters Did anyone
ask Reagan about his marriage

PARKER SWEENEY
I don’t think -- Let’s wrap this up

HART (CONTD)
Did you ask Carter these questions

PARKER
There’ve been rumors --

Yellow Rev 57

INT MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT FRIDAY AFTERNOON

Were watching the ESCALATORS over the shoulders of Fiedler
and Murphy Mostly tourists and businessmen Fiedler is
flipping through a magazine nervously He’s so nervous it’s
comical Murphy is trying to keep it cool

MURPHY
Just calm down

FIEDLER
What am I supposed to do

MURPHY
Act bored Most people usually look
bored What does she look like

FIEDLER
Attractive Hot enough to make you
leave your wife

MURPHY
Honestly wouldn’t take much

Murphy looks ready to give up and then they see her DONNA
Armandt walks alongside her Without saying a word they
begin following her towards the gate
Yellow Rev 58

INT BOEING 737 TO DC - EVENING
Fiedler and Murphy sit deep in coach Fiedler leans into the
aisle to get a look at Donna who’s reading a book a few rows

down He leans a little further and is suddenly hit by the
BEVERAGE CART making a bit of a mess He flinches back

INT NATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL DC - NIGHT

Fiedler and Murphy walk 15 feet behind Donna and Armandt
trying to play it cool

EXT NATIONAL AIRPORT TAXI LINE - NIGHT

Donna and Armandt are shown into a waiting cab

Several people back in the line Fiedler and Murphy watch
anxiously as their marks pull away

MURPHY
Do we know where they’re going

FIEDLER
I fucking hope so

EXT HART’S TOWNHOUSE CAPITOL HILL FRIDAY NIGHT

Fiedler’s TAXI comes up on a stately two-story row house
Lights shine in the windows and illuminate the sidewalk

No one’s visible inside or out
Fiedler and Murphy fight for the driver’s side window

FIEDLER
This one here on the left

CAB DRIVER
You want me to pull over

FIEDLER
Just hang a second

MURPHY
No security Nothing You sure this
is right

FIEDLER
It’s his place
Yellow Rev 59

MCGEE CAB DRIVER
(looking at the house) You guys getting out
Doesn’t feel right

FIEDLER (CONTD)
Just give us a second

Fiedler looks at the windows hoping for an answer

MURPHY
No secret service

FIEDLER
He isn’t the nominee yet

CAB DRIVER
Look I’m not sure what you guys
are up to

MURPHY
(to Fiedler)
I think you got taken buddy

FIEDLER
We’ve been here all of two fucking
seconds

CAB DRIVER

This isn’t a peep show one of you
has to pay me

MURPHY
New destination we need a hotel

FIEDLER
Hold on

Suddenly the lights turn off inside the house
Fiedler and Murphy go silent

CAB DRIVER
Which one of you is going to

FIEDLER
(quietly)
Pull over there

The cab pulls over Inside they all hold still waiting to
see what will happen next

We SEE the front door open A man’s arm holds it open

Hart and Donna come out onto the stoop
Yellow Rev 60

MURPHY
Fuck me

Broadhurst and Armandt follow They walk down to Hart’s
SEDAN all get in and drive off

BACK TO Fiedler suddenly vibrating with mixed energy

MURPHY (CONTD)
We’re gonna need a photographer

CUT TO

THE BACK OF AN SLR CAMERA BEING LOADED WITH FILM

EXT STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE CAPITOL HILL DAWN

Murphy sit in a rental car outside the house as the sun
appears on the horizon He does a crossword In the back seat
with the camera is ROY VALENTINE a photographer

ROY
Youre sure they’re in there

MURPHY
Yep Have you staked out before

ROY
(scoffs)
I mean I’m not a paparazzi Are we
even allowed to do this

MURPHY
A few years ago I figured out most
of the planes carrying kilos of
coke into the US weren’t coming
from Colombia They’re actually
coming from the fucking Bahamas So
I dig a little deeper Turns out
the prime minister is taking pay
offs from Miami lawyers to leave
beach front runways unguarded

ROY
Wo

MURPHY
Yeah “Wo” Sometimes you need to
catch someone in the act I mean
fuck have you ever had to do this
kind of investigative journalism
Yellow Rev ROY
(uncomfortable sharing)
Last year I snuck into the Magic
Kingdom as a tourist I cut right
into Tomorrowland bought a rocket
pop and when no one was looking I
climbed a barricade and caught the
first images of Captain EO
(long beat
It was terrifying but worth it

A long look from Murphy Suddenly THE DOOR OPENS It’s
Fiedler He’s holding a printed out FAX

FIEDLER
Follow me around
(passes it to Murphy)
Hart told the Post to follow him
around

MURPHY
“Follow me around Put a tail on
me Youd be very bored”

FIEDLER
He asked us to follow him

ROY
Technically speaking we were
already following him

MURPHY
Are you fucking kidding me

FIEDLER

It’s an invitation

(off Roy’s skepticism)
Look if this were 20 years ago and
party bosses were still picking the
candidates in back rooms that
would be one thing But things
changed Everyone forgets that
They just handed these primaries
and caucuses back to some folks in
Iowa lined up around the Country
Kitchen to pick nominees they’ve
never heard of you know to vet
some governor or congressman from
god knows where We have a
responsibility here to hold
these guys accountable

EXT STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

It’s RAINING The rental car sits there Three silhouettes
behind the windshield

Inside they’re eating individual cartons of Chinese Just
watching and waiting for something to happen

EXT STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

The car parked in the same spot Murphy and Roy asleep
Fiedler looks up from his newspaper

He SEES a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE and then a JOGGER
Then WILSON (policy aide) approaching the front door

Murphy sits up for a better look He lowers the window an
inch hoping to hear We barely hear the DOORBELL

A moment later the townhouse door opens revealing Hart
wearing a white hoodie and jeans

Wilson hands Hart a thick envelope We barely make out what
they’re saying

HART
Thanks

WILSON
Hopefully this is the last draft

HART
Yeah I’1l give it a look

And then Hart freezes He seems to be either lost in thought
or STARING STRAIGHT AT THE RENTAL CAR Fiedler holds stock

still not sure whether to go back to his paper or drive off
when Hart gives a quick goodbye to Wilson and shuts the door

Fiedler gives Murphy a shove

MURPHY
What’s happening

FIEDLER

MURPHY

Thinks for a second
CUT TO

TAGS BEING RIPPED OFF NEW JOGGING CLOTHES

EXT HART’S TOWNHOUSE - LATE IN THE DAY

Fiedler pretending to run in a ridiculous jogging suit
trots past the rental car giving Murphy a furtive glance

He jogs onto the sidewalk and slows down as he passes Hart’s
townhouse He’s trying to see through the windows but can’t
quite make anything out

INTEXT FIEDLER’S RENTAL CAR - LAST LIGHT

Fiedler finishes his loop and jogs back up to the rental car
and gets back in the passenger seat He’s sweating Hard

MURPHY
Jesus you ran around the block

FIEDLER
Fuck off
(looking for Roy)
Where’s our shooter

Murphy nods toward the house We SEE Roy with his CAMERA
crouching behind a bush trying to get a good angle

FIEDLER (CONTD)
Are you fucking kidding me

MURPHY
He’s young excited What was I
going to say

FIEDLER
He’s going to get us caught

We watch from the car as Roy gets closer to the townhouse
Suddenly one by one the WINDOW BLINDS SLAM SHUT
Yellow Rev 64

FIEDLER (CONT’D)
Fuck

EXT HART’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

A beat as they watch the townhouse The last glow of ambient
daylight disappears into night

And then the front door of the townhouse opens Hart comes
down the steps still wearing his white hoodie

Hart climbs inside his Chrysler He’s visibly nervous A
stark difference from his usual confidence and calm

Hart checks the mirror as he pulls out slowly onto the
street We SEE the Herald’s rental car reflected in the
mirror pulling out to follow him

Hart puts on his blinker and deliberately takes a right turn
onto a side street He checks the mirror again sees the car
following

His jaw clenches His breathing grows shallow We can almost
hear his adrenaline

He pulls to a slow crawl at a stop sign waiting for the
Herald car to get close enough and then Hart hits the brakes
- His TAIL LIGHTS illuminate the car behind him

We can’t quite make out details but we see three male faces
bathed in a red glow He shakes his head to himself

Hart hits the gas Quickly he makes three right turns
bringing us back to

EXT HART’S TOWNHOUSE CAPITOL HILL - NIGHT

Hart re-parks the car outside his house He takes a deep
breath He gets out and looks behind him at the Herald’s

rental car which has come to a stop a few car-lengths away

He puts his head down shoves his hands into his pockets and
heads off briskly into the side alley

The moment he rounds the corner the Herald team quickly
pulls over and jumps out of the car They briskly follow to
the mouth of the alley visually checking in with each other
as they walk

intersection where a side alley meets a BACK ALLEY

You were too close

FIEDLER
(hissing back)
He was already on to us

As they turn the corner into the back alley --

HART (0C)
Good evening gentlemen

Standing in front of them in his white hoodie is HART

A long silent beat The three journalists from the Herald
line up across from Hart Murphy out front Fiedler in the
shadows There’s an eerie High Noon quality to the stand off

No one knows what to do No one has ever been here before
For better or for worse they’ve breached a historical trust
between candidate and the press and they must figure out
the next moment on their own

MURPHY
(nervous )
Good evening Senator I’ma
reporter for the Miami Herald We’d
like to talk to you

Hart holds his ground trying to decipher what’s happening

MURPHY (CONTD)
Um We’d like to ask you about
the woman who’s been staying in
your townhouse

Hart doesn’t move Composes his thoughts specifically

HART
No one is staying in my
townhouse

HART

FIEDLER
Okay Then can you tell us how you
know her

FLASH - Another photo startles Hart

HART
Well I don’t think that’s
relevant

MURPHY
(scoffing)
Oh I assure you Senator it’s
relevant --

FIEDLER
It’s just that we saw you leave
and come back with this woman And
we didn’t see her leave again

Yellow Rev 67

FIEDLER

that Tom I am not --

FLASH

MURPHY
Can you produce the woman so she
can corroborate what you’re saying

HART
I don’t have to produce This has
gone on long enough

Hart takes a step forward as if to leave and Roy snaps two
more photos blinding Hart momentarily Hart blinks The
flashes begin to build now more and more - Frustrating Hart

FIEDLER
Senator we know you’ve made calls
to this woman You called her from
Kansas And New Hampshire We have
the dates

HART

how I’d remember and I don’t see

owe it to us to be forthcoming

our own eyes

HART
The only thing I deny is the idea
that somehow you have the right to
ask these things

FIEDLER
Youre running for president

HART
I’m aware of that Tom It’s in the
papers
FLASH FLASH
FIEDLER

Then you have a responsibility --

HART

responsibilities are

Do you know yours

Hart goes to leave but Murphy steps into his path

MURPHY

Hart moves to the back door of the townhouse amidst multiple
FLASHES And then he’s gone

A moment as the two journalists and the photographer catch
their breath and look at each other - What just happened

And then they scuttle off down the alleyway We boom up to a
WINDOW and find Hart catching his breath He grabs for a
phone Begins to dial

DIXON (CONTD)
We need to go through some things
This boat cruise I’m hearing about
for one and --

WILSON
Do we think they completely missed
the back door of the townhouse

SHORE
It’s not in the piece They must
not have checked

STRATTON
If they don’t have her leaving

DIXON SHORE
Without the back door the
entire article amounts to -

STRATTON (CONTD)
- Garbage Come to think I don’t
remember many alleyways in Florida

WILSON
Of course Florida developed after
the industrial revolution No horse
and carriage It is a primarily
front door community

HART
Forget the fucking back door The
point is it’s nobody’s goddamn
business None of it is They
shouldn’t have been there period
(beat)
Now if we can all move on

DIXON
That’s what we’re trying to do

HART
I’ve been doing this for 20 years
So have you The public doesn’t
care about this crap They won’t
stand for it

DIXON
This isn’t 72 It’s not even ‘82
It’s different now I don’t know
why but it is If we get our story
down we can --

HART
There is no story They can write
all this crap all they want but
they will not earn the dignity of
my response

DIXON
Jesus Gary How about us Do we
deserve a response

HART
About this No

Shore and Wilson look like kids whose parents are fighting

DIXON
I’ve got a hundred kids unpacking
boxes back in Denver right now
because we told them you would do
what it took to win I told them
The best and the brightest They
left families and jobs Billy left
his fiance --

SHORE
She left me --
Yellow Rev DIXON
People are sacrificing for you

HART
I’m not sacrificing Should I
sacrifice my privacy My self-
respect It won’t just be me who
gets dragged down None of those
kids you’re talking about will ever
work another campaign where some
candidate doesn’t have to account
for who comes and goes from their
bedroom And that’s just the
beginning

DIXON
We’re not talking about that
Future campaigns at the moment
are not our responsibility We’re
talking about how you get through
today without pissing away
everything we’ve worked for on this
campaign

HART
This campaign is about the future
not rumors and sleaze I care about
the sanctity of this process
whether you do or do not

And he’s finished Dixon pauses Watching

HART (CONT’D)

I want to reexamine the language on
page 17 It’s not just the specter
of a trade war I worry about It’s
the loss of influence globally

using it after the fact to justify
some tabloid bullshit

who by their own admission
undertook a spotty surveillance

correctness of our story

This is a story about a married man
who spent a considerable amount of
time with an unmarried woman Weve
never speculated on what went on

If I may it’s because you simply
don’t know Despite hiding in the
bushes outside my home

We briefly find Fiedler in the audience

We know you called Donna Rice
several times from the campaign
trail We know she was seen leaving
your town house in Washington

Well was she leaving or not In
your story she didn’t leave my
home Now you’re saying she did

MARTINDALE
Senator when we interviewed you
Yellow Rev 104

HART
Your newsmen accosted me in my
alleyway Some interview

MARTINDALE
With all due respect

HART
It’s a little late for respect
sir You ambushed me outside my
home in the middle of the night
after putting me under some half-
baked stake out During which
your crack reporting team failed to
realize my home had a back door

MARTINDALE
(youre going with that)
A back door

HART
Some surveillance is no better than
zero surveillance In fact it’s
worse

MARTINDALE
You do your job we’ll do ours

HART
It would be a welcome change

Martindale throws his hands in exasperation Meanwhile Parker
furiously takes notes

Now if no one else minds I’d like
to discuss something a little more
exciting Economics

LAUGHTER as we close in on Fiedler also taking notes when a

No thanks

BRADLEE
Run me through this again

DEVROY
They’re part of a PI report A
certain Senator thought his wife
was sleeping with Hart

BRADLEE
Jesus this guy
DEVROY KAISER
Who Were thinking Tydings
DEVROY

But as it turns out Hart isn’t
fucking Mrs Tydings He’s been
schtupping this other woman

We SEE a few photos up close - A smart looking political
woman is EMBRACING Hart and letting him into her house

BRODER
What a town

BRADLEE
How did we get this

DEVROY
Anonymous package

BRADLEE
I hate those You got something to
say - Say it
(to Kaiser)
Give me some of that gum

KAISER

You think Tydings sent it
DEVROY

But why
BRODER

Are we going to even talk about
Bush Hart’s running against the
former head of the CIA
Yellow Rev BRADLEE
Not yet he’s not

DEVROY
No return address no note Just a
date Six months ago

KAISER

Well there’s your other shoe Ben
BRADLEE

Yup
PARKER

I mean just because an unmarked
envelope lands in our laps That
doesn’t obligate us to

DEVROY
It’s a pattern of behavior
Womanizing Lies

PARKER
He’s not lying to us

DEVROY
Christ don’t be so naive

BRADLEE
I have no doubt the same envelope
probably landed in the laps of
three other enterprising reporters

PARKER
Okay I mean can’t we let some
other paper run gossip as front
page news Doesn’t mean we

BRADLEE

But it does AJ It does now
(professorial)

We decline to publish and then
some other pissant paper runs with
it anyway I don’t know the
Poughkeepsie Journal or the
Miami Herald or the New York
Times And the TVs go fucking
apeshit over the story And we get
on our high horse and say well we
still dont think it’s news
because after all we didn’t think
it was news before right

BRADLEE (CONTD)
And now the wires are running a
story about how we won’t cover the
only thing anyone in the entire
country is talking about and so
on and so on

A beat of silence Bradlee looks to Broder - What do you
think Broder shakes his head - no

INT BREAK ROOM WASHINGTON POST - EVENING
Parker walks up to find Devroy making coffee by herself

PARKER
Why do you hate him so much

DEVROY
I don’t hate Gary Hart I don’t
think I trust him

PARKER
That’s one approach

DEVROY
That’s my job

PARKER
To pass judgement

DEVROY
To be skeptical I don’t think his
own wife trusts him Why should I

PARKER
I think you should trust him on the
things that matter

DEVROY
Okay I question his respect for
women

PARKER

Are you kidding me He loves women
Too much frankly

DEVROY
He uses them

PARKER
Aren’t we being a little precious
here He’s smart and handsome and
these women are throwing themselves
at him
Yellow Rev 111

DEVROY
He’s a man with power and
opportunity and that takes a
certain responsibility If he was
some day trader screwing cocktail
girls I could handle just not
liking him but as our potential
next president as a woman that
makes me nervous And as a
journalist you should care

PARKER
I think you’re being a little
sensitive

DEVROY
Oh fuck you You know what name
I’d like to hear Gary Hart say
Donna Rice

PARKER
(combative)
What exactly is he supposed to say

DEVROY
I don’t know I’m not running for
president He is And now we get to
see what he does when he’s under
pressure He throws a woman under
the campaign bus

Devroy leaves with her coffee A nearby clerk motions for
Parker’s attention

INT DARTMOUTH INN HANOVER NH - NIGHT

We find Irene Kelly subdued inside a phone booth Dialing a

INT BILL DIXON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The phone is ringing We turn to see Dixon in his favorite
chair watching the BASEBALL GAME He ignores the incoming

call for a long time then finally lifts the receiver

DIXON
Yeah

KELLY
You’re missing all the excitement
Yellow Rev 112

DIXON
(a beat)
Thank God

KELLY
Looks like we’re turning the corner
out here I could get you a flight

Dixon has no response Perhaps Kelly expected that

DIXON
What’s on your mind

KELLY
I just keep thinking This is
never going to be over for her
Every time she applies for a job
She doesn’t have a staff of
overeducated volunteers As far as
I can tell she’s alone

A long pause

KELLY (CONT’D)
You got anything for me

Dixon thinks He can’t tell her that she’s wrong

DIXON
Buck up kid You’ve got work to do

Kelly nods Sucks it up

INT VIP SUITE DARTMOUTH INN - NEXT MORNING

HART
I don’t need one

WILSON
(to Stratton)
You couldn’t get a podium

STRATTON
Don’t start with me
Yellow Rev 113

SWEENEY (0S)
How’re voters supposed to believe
you You’ve clearly been lying

HART
They will or they won’t I don’t
think they much care

We SEE Shore sitting in plush chairs nearby sipping a Coke
Sweeney is pacing Hart pops up

SWEENEY
(friendly again)
You can cite the polls here

HART
I don’t care about polls

SHORE and WILSON
(finishing each other’s
thoughts )

Yes you do Gallup just came out of
the field - Do you think the media
went too far in its reporting on
Senator Harts private life 64
percent say yes Do you think a
candidates behavior in his
marriage is relevant to his
qualifications as president 38
percent say yes 52 percent no

SWEENEY
Take that fuckers

HART
64 percent Got it

WILSON
(quietly to Shore)
They’1l ask about phone calls

HART

Uh-huh I call lots of people
SWEENEY

Right That’s fine
KELLY

Are we going to bring up Donna

Rice

The mention of her name chills the room
Yellow Rev 114

KELLY (CONTD)
We could ask the pool to respect
her privacy

SWEENEY
Are you fucking nuts
KELLY
It could be seen as a noble

gesture

Kelly looks to Hart for a response but gets nothing

SHORE
(to Hart)
They may ask you about you know
Women
HART

They can talk to Irene or Ginny
Anyone who’s worked for me

SWEENEY and SHORE
Yeah I think what Billy means
Have there been others Women that
aren’t your wife

HART
(turning quickly)
Now you have got to be kidding me
I’m not going to answer that Not
for them and not for you That’s
nobody’s goddamn business

SWEENEY
That’s it That’s perfect That’s

your answer

There’s a knock at the door It opens revealing LEE HART
The team quickly begins gathering their things to leave

SHORE
I’1l come back when it’s time

The door closes behind them leaving just Gary and Lee He’s
sitting on the edge of the bed unsure whether to move

Lee walks to the window

HART
I I’m sorry I
Hart bows

Yellow Rev 115

LEE
I’ve woken up the last two mornings
to the sound of helicopters
They’re waiting at our gates
Dozens of them Trucks with
satellites Their trash littered
all over our driveway

HART
How’s Andrea

LEE
She’s disappointed

his head in shame

LEE (CONTD)
(stoic)

Just to leave our home She had to
climb in the back seat One of your
staffers threw an old blanket over
our daughter That’s how she left
our house Hiding like a criminal
Like she should be ashamed

HART
(stumbling)
These people should be ashamed
(adding)
The public won’t stand for it

LEE
(staring out the window)
Right

HART
Lee I’m so sorry

LEE

I can imagine Sorry you got

yourself in this mess
(scoffs)

I’m sorry too

Gary wants to apologize but doesn’t know how

HART
I feel so foolish

LEE
Maybe I’m the foolish one I gave
you all that rope and then I
tripped over it
Yellow Rev 116

Lee begins walking to Gary

LEE (CONTD)
Were you thinking of me when you
were flirting with this girl Were
you thinking of me on that boat
when you were making her laugh in
front of fifty other people Were
you thinking of me when you invited
her into our home

Gary shakes his head then drops it A long beat

HART
Are you leaving me

LEE

I didn’t fly across the country
just to say goodbye That’s what
phones are for

HART
You think you can you accept my
apology

LEE

Not right now - Not yet - Maybe at
some point And that might feel
like a burden It should You hurt
me and you need to know that
You need to feel it Carry it so I
don’t have to

(a beat)
There’1l be a time for us to talk
about why you did this and why I
should ever trust you again But
that will have to wait When it’s
just the two of us

Lee now standing before him as he sits hunched on the bed He
reaches out and wraps his arms around her torso hugging her
She rests her hands on his shoulders

INT WASHINGTON POST - EVENING
Devroy is working with a LAYOUT EDITOR at a LIGHT TABLE
LAYOUT EDITOR
If we push the girl scout diamond

anniversary to page three we’ll
have to lose the picture
Yellow Rev DEVROY
Fuck I liked the picture Is this
to make room for the tank piece

Bradlee wanders in

DEVROY (CONTD)
(to Layout)
Find a way to save the girl scouts

Bradlee and Devroy begin moving copy on the light table
absentmindedly as they discuss the following

BRADLEE
At some point we need to draw a
line in the sand We might not
agree where that line is

DEVROY
Where does honesty fall

BRADLEE
Ask a man enough questions and
youre going to reach a point where
he either has to lie or simply
refrain from answering which is
kind of the same as lying

DEVROY
Maybe if he didn’t put himself ina
position where he needed to lie

BRADLEE
I’m talking about what’s relevant
Some paper is going to want to know
if the president can still get it
up or if the first lady still goes
down on him

DEVROY
I’m not asking to know any of that

BRADLEE
But we’re opening a door I don’t
know Maybe the door’s already
open

DEVROY
I’m a reporter I can only work
with what’s presented to me I
follow leads I look for the truth
And the truth is he lied to his
wife and then he lied to all of us
Is that relevant
Yellow Rev 118

INT PARKER’S CUBICLE WASHINGTON POST - EVENING

Bradlee walks by Parker’s desk He drops the ENVELOPE OF

BRADLEE
You have a train to catch

Puts his hand on Parker’s shoulder and keeps moving

EXT DARTMOUTH INN HANOVER NH - NEXT MORNING

The news vans have assembled It’s as bad as we’ve seen it

INT DARTMOUTH INN RESTAURANT - MORNING
Shore walks up the staircase to the second floor dining area

The place buzzes with anticipation We find Parker at a table
with a NOTEPAD and coffee

At another table McDaniel Weinberg and Shanahan watch
Parker with mixed envy

SHANAHAN
Follow me

WEINBERG
Can you believe that He just
stumbled into a Pulitzer

MCDANTEL
I don’t know

SHANAHAN
What don’t you know

MCDANIEL
I want my president to be smarter
than me not trying to outsmart me
Broder sits with the older crew - Germond Broder Wynman
Shore comes walking through and Germond grabs his attention
WYMAN
Let Gary know we’re around if he

wants a drink With old friends

SHORE
The senator is unavailable
Yellow Rev 119

Shore keeps walking Germond takes in the moment The others
at the table weigh the feeling of being shut out Broder
stands up and walks over to AJ Parker

BRODER
You know you don’t have to do this

Parker looks up in question

BRODER (CONTD)
You think you’re the first guy he
asked

Off Parker’s look Broder keeps walking Parker nods

INT HART’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

ready in silence There’s a distance though they are
preparing for battle together Lee gives her husband a look
She fixes his tie NEWS about Hart plays on the TV

PRELAP of the press conference - A dozen cameras firing away

HART (0S)
Yes over there Ann

INT DARTMOUTH INN BANQUET ROOM HANOVER NH AFTERNOON

Were in a tight room with no raised platform or podium Hart
stands surrounded by over one hundred sitting journalists and
photographers Close enough to bite him His team leans
against the wall along with Lee who stands by Irene Kelly

MCDANIEL
Doesn’t this episode call your
judgment as a leader into question

HART
Yes I suppose I made some
mistakes But I think judgment
like character has to be measured
in the full context of a career I
think what I’ve undertaken in the
Senate the plans I’ve outlined for
the nation speak to my judgment
I’m not aware of anyone having
questioned my integrity as a public
servant

VARIOUS REPORTERS
Senator Hart Senator Over here
Yellow Rev 120

We see Stratton on all fours trying to body-block the crowd
of reporters from Hart

A quick look at Lee Smiling and composed Then we see Parker
watching her

HART
Yes

GERMOND
You were quoted once as saying you
love danger Is that why you think
you put yourself in this position

HART
(smiling)
I don’t love it that much Jack

LAUGHTER among the press corps A releasing of tension
Angle on Shore Sweeney Wilson exchanging a relieved glance

SHANAHAN
You said there’s no relationship
Are you willing to take a lie
detector test

HART
I think the voters are a pretty
good lie detector test

Broder and Germond chuckling

WEINBERG
Will they believe you

HART
Well I think they do The last
poll I saw said that most voters
think the Herald was out of line
More than 60 percent in fact

SWEENEY
64 percent

HART
When the numbers are in your favor
always be specific

Another chuckle from the group More shouts for attention
HART (CONTD)

(pointing towards Parker)
Yes
Yellow Rev 121

Parker and another reporter hesitate unsure of which one
Hart’s pointing to

HART (CONTD)
Mr Parker Go ahead

Parker steadies himself

PARKER
(voice quivering)
Yes Senator Thank you Good
afternoon

HART
Good afternoon to you AJ Glad you
could make it

PARKER
Yes Senator in your speech
yesterday you raised the issue of
morality I’d like to um ask you
what you mean specifically by
that I have a series of questions
if you don’t mind

HART
All right

PARKER
When you said you did nothing
‘immoral’ did you mean that you
had no sexual relationship with
Donna Rice last weekend or at any
other time

HART
I’ve said there was no
relationship That’s correct

A pause Parker continues

PARKER
Do you believe that adultery is
immoral

HART

Do I Well yes I do
Hart’s team grows uncomfortable with where this is going
PARKER

Senator Have you ever committed
adultery
Yellow Rev 122

It gets so quiet we almost hear a GASP in the group
Older reporters shake their heads in disbelief
Lee’s face falls

We can see Sweeney hoping for Hart to come back swinging
Come on Come on

SWEENEY
(under his breath)
Say it Say it
Hart opens his mouth but freezes No sound emerges
He looks to Lee He looks to his feet
HART
III guess I don’t think
that’s a fair question
It’s a flinch The campaign team bows their heads as the room
goes mad with questions and camera flashes arms lifting for
follow up questions
WYMAN a photographer we recognise from earlier bar scenes a
friend of Hart makes eye contact with Hart then goes back
to taking photos

We see Broder leaving the room

Hart and Lee exchange a look amidst the noise Too many
questions at once

And then quiet

INT INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN BUS - DAY

The Harts and their entourage sit quietly They’re shell-
shocked For a long moment no one speaks

SWEENEY
Are we doing the last event

Hart’s rummaging in his suit pocket distractedly
SHORE
Supposed to have a Town Hall in

Littleton

Hart produces a small blue figurine from his pocket He
examines it in wonder
Yellow Rev 123

LEE
What’s that

HART
I believe it’s called a Smurf

SHORE
Brainy Smurf actually

INT RESTAURANT OF THE LITTLETON INN - DAY

A WAITER clears plates from the table where Hart Lee Shore
Stratton and Wilson are eating

the schedule as tight as we can

STRATTON

The waiter is looking at Gary who stares straight ahead

LEE (CONT’D)

HART

Hart waves off the waiter

MOVE TO the entrance of the restaurant SWEENEY is returning
from the bathroom He’s stopped by PARKER who is holding a
now familiar PADDED ENVELOPE

PARKER

Yellow Rev 124

SWEENEY
(venom)
Are you fucking kidding me

PARKER
Something’s come up I have some
questions

SWEENEY
You think anyone’s letting you
anywhere near their candidate

PARKER
Come on man

SWEENEY
Oh and I used to steal beer from
the corner deli in high school I
tried coke at Berkley and I

cheated on my girlfriend Twice
Just to save you the time

Parker starts opening the PADDED ENVELOPE
We move back to the Hart table

SHORE
Maybe we move up military reform
Do a big rollout here

STRATTON
Yeah It’s just

LEE
(to Gary)
I need to call Andrea I’11 be
right back

Shore finds a couple dimes for Lee

Hart kind of nods as we follow Lee to the PAY PHONES on the
wall She begins to dial

Back to Hart and the campaign team We begin to push on Hart
as the chatter between Shore and Stratton becomes a low
whisper Just noise along with the silverware

STRATTON
I’m all for shaking more hands I’m
just not sure I can get him
anywhere near them just yet
Yellow Rev 125

SHORE WAITER
Could call Denver get some (returning)
more bodies -- Fresh coffees On the house

STRATTON (CONTD)
What if we booked some TV time
I mean how long would it take to
shoot a 30-minute spot

WILSON
Saying what

SHORE
Can we pay for that

STRATTON
Go directly to the voters Talk
about reporters out of control
invasion of privacy

Hart looks to the entrance He SEES Sweeney and Parker
Sweeney is leafing through PHOTOS His posture falling

Hart leans towards Irene Kelly for a moment

HART
Any word from Miami

KELLY
How do you mean

HART
Is she okay

KELLY
I don’t know how you want me to
answer that

Hart’s face tightens He nods Registering the guilt

BACK TO Sweeney and Parker Sweeney now leafing through the
photos His face doesn’t betray his feelings He looks up

SWEENEY
Congratulations You just became
the National Enquirer You’re fifty
cents at the register

Back to the campaign team Their conversation is down to a
whisper The noise of the restaurant continues to build

SHORE
I’m not sure enough people would
see it
Yellow Rev 126

STRATTON
If the media won’t talk about it

WILSON
Wed need a national buy

STRATTON
Where the hell is Dixon

And then Hart hears LEE on the phone cutting through the
rest He turns to the PAY PHONES Lee is clearly emotional

Hart stands up and walks over to his wife

LEE
(emotional on the phone)
OK you’re home now And you’re
safe

We faintly HEAR Andrea’s voice CRYING as she speaks Hart is
slowly cracking

LEE (CONTD)
(on phone)
It’s outrageous They cannot they
will not hound you like this They
shouldn’t be anywhere near you We
will take care of this

Lee’s eyes begin to tear up as Gary pulls her into his arms -
A family just trying to hold on

HART
(quietly)
Lee It’s time to go home
We move back to the campaign table Sweeney is joining the
table but Stratton Shore and Wilson have already clocked
the Harts at the pay phone It couldn’t be more clear

It’s over

EXT DRIVEWAY TROUBLESOME GULCH COLORADO MORNING

We SEE the WAGONEER weaving through the NEWS VANS

EXT HART’S FRONT PORCH TROUBLESOME GULCH - DAY

Trippi pours ice tea for the campaign team as Hart writes
notes on a legal pad Ad-libbed thanks and comments but it’s
mostly quiet Stratton looks out the side checking out the
helicopters with bewilderment Shore pulls him away
Yellow Rev 127

Hart pauses He looks out into the trees - Vast beautiful
Colorado It’s wild and unmistakably American

HART
You know when General Lee resigned
his commission in the union army to
command the confederate forces he
had to leave his house in
Washington behind

The campaign team turns to listen As does Lee even though
she’s heard this story before

HART (CONTD)
The union informed Lincoln and
asked if they should tear it down -
Light it on fire what have you
But Lincoln had a different idea
He told them to bury the
confederate soldiers in Lee’s

backyard
STRATTON
Jesus
HART
That’s how we got Arlington
cemetery

Hart looks at his backyard - an infinite run of trees leading
to red mountains

INT HART CAMPAIGN OFFICE DENVER - MORNING

For the first time - Quiet A couple people answer phones

Dixon approaches Terzano Her eyes are red He hands her an
ENVELOPE from a stack She eyes him quizzically

DIXON

Cash it before the end of the day

Dixon moves to Bill Martin and hands him an envelope

INT CORRIDOR EXECUTIVE TOWER INN DENVER - MORNING

PRELAP the rapid clicking of a hundred camera shutters
Yellow Rev 128

HART (0S)

In public life somethings may be
interesting but that doesn’t
necessarily mean they’re important

Hart is moving down a line of his campaign team shaking
hands In effect saying goodbye to them At 51 he is about
to walk way from public service for the rest of his life

Each good bye carries its own weight - Stratton Emerson
Wilson Kelly Sweeney Shore

INT HOTEL ROOM EXECUTIVE TOWER INN - DAY

Hart enters to find Lee waiting for him He sits across from
her For a moment they just stare at each other We can tell
by their body language that this is the beginning of a
difficult conversation What will be the first of many But
we CANNOT hear them Rather we give them their privacy

Meanwhile in the corner on a television we see Hart ata
podium with no notes giving his farewell

INT EXECUTIVE TOWER BALLROOM (ON TV) - DAY
The camera scans the crowd then cuts to Hart at the podium

HART (ON TV)
Clearly under present
circumstances this campaign can’t
go on I refuse to submit my family
and my friends to further rumors
and gossip It’s an intolerable
situation

In the room Hart reaches for Lee’s hand
On TV We see a brief moment of Parker watching

HART (ON TV) (CONTD)
But we’re all going to have to
seriously question the system for
selecting our national leaders that
has reporters in bushes and
photographers peeking in our
windows That reduces the press of
this nation into hunters and the
presidential candidates into the
hunted

ON TV As Hart gathers himself we SEE Kelly standing with
Shore and Wilson starting to cry
Yellow Rev 129

HART (CONT’D)

After which ponderous pundits
wonder in mock seriousness why some
of the best people in the country
choose not to run for high office
Politics in this country is on the
verge of becoming another form of
athletic competition or sport We’d
all better do something to make
this system work or we’re all
going to be soon rephrasing
Jefferson to say I tremble for my
country when I think we may in
fact get the kind of leaders we
deserve

The TV goes out of focus We push in on the Harts as Lee
takes Gary’s hands into her own

CUT TO BLACK
