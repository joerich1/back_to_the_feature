CLOSE ON Shaking old hands clip an article out of a
newspaper Several lines have already been underlined

“SEEMING TNABILITY TO GAIN CONVICTIONS IN EVEN THE MOST
HEINOUS CRIMES”

“ APPARENTLY FALTERED UNDER THE AWESOME BURDEN
COMPLEXITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF HIS OFFICE”

“I HAVE NOTHING BUT SYMPATHY FOR THE MAN WHO ONCE SERVED
HIS COUNTRY SO WELL”

CLOSE ON Beads of sweat on a forehead The phone rings The
sound of someone picking up then a voice on the other end

OLD HELEN GANDY (VO)
Sir the writer is here from the PR
Department

OLD HOOVER (V0)(0S)
Set him up a typewriter in my outer
office and show him my photos of
A Mitchell Palmer

INT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME LIBRARY - 1919 - NIGHT

A tall strong square jawed man in his late 40’s A
MITCHELL PALMER sits in the downstairs library of his four
story townhouse on R street a posh DC neighborhood in 1919

OLD HOOVER (VO)
Attorney General Palmer was a
Quaker He didn’t believe in war
But he understood the necessity of
strength and resolve Believe--

Palmer watches his WIFE pad quietly up the stairs He checks
a clock against his watch and corrects the minute hand 11PM

INT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Palmer undresses but instead of joining his wife in bed he
clicks on a lamp by a chair and settles in with a book

OLD HOOVER (VO)
--what you will from historians
Most write from a present
perspective forgetting context
Mitchell Palmer was a hero
Palmer looks to a window listening to the WHIR OF A
MOTORCAR the HORSE HOOVES ON THE COBBLESTONES He goes back
to reading ignoring the new sounds outside A CAR PULLS UP A
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THEN A CRASH
DOWNSTAIRS AS IF SOMETHING WAS THROWN AGAINST THE DOOR

A BLINDING FLASH A MASSIVE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE HOUSE
THE WALLS CRACK GLASS SHATTERS FURNITURE GOES FLYING

Palmer is hurled from his chair his wife thrown from her
bed Palmer lifts himself off the floor rushes to his wife
and pulls her out of the room

INT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

They race down the twisted crumbling stairs Palmer falls
through a broken step pulls himself back up and wills them
to a bedroom door where a GIRL CAN BE HEARD SCREAMING

The door frame has buckled but its no match for Palmer’s
brute strength He throws his body against the door
revealing his TEEN DAUGHTER crying hysterically the electric
lights flickering on and off His wife runs to her side

Everything is suddenly silent Palmer cautiously navigates
what remains of the stairs Around any corner is a potential
assassin A sudden crash An assailant He braces himself and
pulls a banister rung off to use as a weapon

As he turns the corner to the ground floor he finds utter
destruction A STUFFED ELKS HEAD thrown to the floor parquet
flooring ripped to pieces piles of rubble and everywhere
SPOTS OF FRESH BLOOD starting to drip down the walls

He looks to where his front wall and windows once were Out
on the street a car has blown over And piercing the silence

FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT (VO)
Mr Palmer

Palmer rushes beside the mantle for protection but its
bricks crumble to the floor

Stepping into the cavernous remains of the home is a 30-year-
old version of future president FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT with
braces on his legs and a crutch Behind him lifting her
skirt to avoid stepping on the hem is a young ELEANOR

MITCHELL PALMER
Mr Roosevelt Thank Thee Thank
thee Lord it’s you
EXT WASHINGTON DC SEWARD SQUARE - THAT NIGHT

A young man 24 burst out the door of a modest two story
home in a simple suit holding a bike He’s built like a fire
plug with wavy black hair attractive in a bulldogish way

He hops on his bike and peddles determinedly stopping at
each intersection like a model citizen then peddling his
heart out again This is young JOHN EDGAR HOOVER

OLD HOOVER (VO)
Across the country eight bombs
exploded that night All at 11PM
Two United States Senators four
cabinet members a Supreme Court
Justice John D Rockerfeller JP
Morgan All of them targeted

As he rides out of frame REVEAL only a few blocks away the
dome of the US Capital peaks over the tops of the working
class homes Further in the distance puffs of smoke and
flames The city is in turmoil

EXT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

Not a single window on the block survived the blast Tree
limbs are down Cars are on their sides The block is lit up
with flood lights Detectives and reporters swarm Police
push neighbors back roping off the neighborhood

A LONG POV Mitchell Palmer’s giant shoe steps through the
wreckage almost crushing a severed finger lying in the
street He is flanked by young Roosevelt and another up and
coming neighbor young DWIGHT D EISENHOWER

MITCHELL PALMER
This may be the end of days for
this country Dwight

Palmer picks up the finger without putting on a glove and
hands it to an INSPECTOR who puts it in a TRASH TIN

REVEAL this is all young Edgar’s POV He is on his bike just
behind the police ropes watching the investigators carelessly
sweep up evidence two guns remains of a suitcase an
EnglishItalian dictionary

IN A MANNER THAT WILL BECOME A TRADEMARK OF THE FILM we see
what Edgar sees a brief imagined STRING OF LIGHT connects
the severed finger to A BLOWN OPEN BRIEFCASE He’s making
connections Organizing
But the strings vanish when the inspectors use buckets to
CLEAN UP THE BLOOD instead of collecting it It’s not clumsy
it’s customary This isn’t 2009 it’s 1919 Still Edgar is
disturbed by the vanishing connections

Suddenly a gust of wind shakes the trees and reveals
hundreds of PINK HAND-BILLS in the road Their festive color
stands in stark contrast to the destruction Edgar gathers
any that blow past the police line He reads one We hear

OLD HOOVER (VO)
“There will have to be BLOODSHED
there will have to be MURDER we
will KILL because it is necessary
we will destroy to rid the world of
your tyrannical institution”

ANGLE ON Palmer notices Edgar collecting the fliers

INSPECTOR
Is he a neighbor sir Should we
question him

MITCHELL PALMER
No He works in my office

INSPECTOR
Is he an investigator

MITCHELL PALMER
He manages the filing system

And without knowing he’s been spotted Edgar jumps back on
his bike and peddles away holding the BRIGHT PINK FLIERS

AGENT SMITH (VO) (PRE-LAP)
You were at Attorney General
Palmer’s home that night

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FBI HALLWAY - 1963 - DAY

The camera cruises down the halls of the “MODERN” FBI The
agents are dressed to perfection Everything is in its place

OLD HOOVER (VO)
Leave that to the reader’s
imagination It’s important to give
the protagonist a bit of mystery

INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE —- SAME TIME

A handsome clean cut young FBI agent AGENT SMITH sits
behind a 60’s typewriter taking notes on a pad of paper
AGENT SMITH
I could allude to a young man whose
description matches yours The best
of both worlds

REVEAL standing across the room behind a mahogany desk is a
stout old man with a mashed in nose wearing a three piece
suit and holding one of those OLD PINK FLIERS from 1919 This
is Hoover almost 40 years later now J EDGAR HOOVER He
lets out a laugh that leaves behind a smile He isn’t the
brute he’s come to be known as He’s surprisingly warm

OLD HOOVER
Where did you get your law degree

AGENT SMITH
George Washington I grew up here
I had a mom to take care of so I
stayed close I received an English
degree there as well

Hoover walks behind him reads out of his typewriter

OLD HOOVER
Then I don’t have to tell you that
what determines a legacy is often
what isn’t seen What’s critical
at this moment is that we RE-
clarify the difference between
villain and hero How do you think
that compares with today

The young man winds the paper out of the typewriter

AGENT SMITH
I’m not sure sir I’d like to hear
more I could come back tomorrow

OLD HOOVER
Fine The pages stay here though

AGENT SMITH
Yes sir

Hoover grabs the young agent’s hand and shakes it holding it
a bit longer than normal The agent knows he’s being sized
up He goes taking his typewriter with him

Left alone Hoover inspects the hand he just shook with IT’S
PERFECTLY DRY It WAS a test and Hoover seems pleased He
puts the OLD PINK FLIER back in an ancient file folder
INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FBI HALLWAY - 1919 - DAY

Young Edgar walks down the long hall (same as earlier but 45
years earlier) with a staccato gate in a crisp white shirt
holding that same (but brand new) file with THE PINK FLIERS

A GAGGLE OF SECRETARIES dresses to the floor are headed
right toward him Most are far older than him

HEAD SECRETARY
Good morning John Mr Palmer has
asked that you attend the emergency
meeting today

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s Mr Hoover please

HEAD SECRETARY
Two o’clock Don’t be too early
again It’s as rude as being tardy

She bustles off with the rest but not before a slim young
secretary 22 with dark hair lovely eyes and a high
collar makes eye contact with him Edgar isn’t shy

YOUNG HOOVER
And who is this lovely addition to
the secretarial pool

HEAD SECRETARY
Helen introduce yourself

HELEN GANDY
Pleased to meet you Mr Hoover
I’m Helen Gandy

YOUNG HOOVER
Welcome to the Department of
Justice Miss Gandy Please let
Mr Palmer know I will attend

As if he had any choice in the matter The secretaries brush
off mocking his attempt at grandiosity Edgar shares one
last glance with Helen before she vanishes

EXT WASHINGTON DC PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - EVENING

Packards Model Ts bikes and horse drawn coaches rumble by
Edgar’s trolly all sharing the cobblestone streets

IT’S THE MIDDLE OF THE DC RACE RIOTS Smoke drifts from a
business a block down The trolly keeps pace with OFFICERS
chasing a BLACK MAN But as they reach an intersection the
police are greeted with a CROWD OF OTHER BLACK MEN The
police are overwhelmed Edgar watches like it’s a play
refusing to let it dampen his mood

EXT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME —- LATER

As Edgar approaches the house he spots a GRAY-HAIRED
EMACIATED MAN rocking manically on the porch in a wicker
chair Edgar steels himself and climbs the steps

As soon as the old man spots Edgar he starts SCREAMING
BLOODY MURDER Edgar ignores it he won’t let this ruin his
cheerful mood either He walks into his house

INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME — CONTINUOUS

As Edgar walks in he sees his MOTHER a stout outgoing
opinionated woman bent over tuning the radio her giant back
side to him It’s all he sees A FLASH--

INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - (IN HIS MIND MEMORY)
Edgar sits at his mother’s feet She pets him like a child

HOOVER’S MOTHER
Madame Marcia held court this
morning Her premonition I
should buy a dress She said your
father will die soon and when he
does you will rise to be the most
powerful man in the country Your
brother is a good man EDGAR but
you will restore our family to
greatness EDGAR--

He looks up with childlike fear Her “Edgar’s” cross the cut--
INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT
In reality Edgar is sitting by the radio with his Mother

EDGAR’S MOTHER
--Edgar Am I boring you

YOUNG HOOVER
I’m listening You fired the maid

EDGAR’S MOTHER
I told her after she was through
with her work she could quit as I
was not paying for her impudence
The whole Negro race is in open
revolt
YOUNG HOOVER EDGARS MOTHER
I could open an They’ve gotten too
investigation comfortable

YOUNG HOOVER
Did you hear me I said I could
open an investigation

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Say what you mean

YOUNG HOOVER
(beaming)
Mr Palmer called me into a meeting
today The war against the radicals
has begun He insisted that I lead
a new Anti-Radical division

EDGAR’S MOTHER
(skeptical)
And did you leap like a dog

YOUNG HOOVER
I told him “This is perhaps the
greatest threat our nation has ever
faced I can NOT take the job
unless I feel certain I can be
effective”

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Well done But you’1ll take it

YOUNG HOOVER
Three thousand a year

EDGAR’S MOTHER
I’ll have to get you all new
clothes You can’t dress like this
anymore

YOUNG HOOVER
I have forty names of suspected
radicals already in only four
hours I’ll have ten thousand by
the end of the month And I have my
own staff Trusted agents

EDGAR’S MOTHER
(critical)
Are you smoking Edgar
YOUNG HOOVER
(ashamed)
It doesn’t come naturally

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Listen to the doctor With this new
burden your nerves could get the
best of you You don’t want to end
up like your father Go try one
now You can put your father in his
room

YOUNG HOOVER
I have to get ready for dinner

EDGAR’S MOTHER
You’re abandoning me tonight

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s with a typist She’s very
organized

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Is it a date

YOUNG HOOVER
I think so I’m going to show her
my old card catalogue system at the
library of Congress

EDGAR’S MOTHER
(disappointed critical)
Card catalogues Edgar

And with that the screen door opens and Edgar’s emaciated
father walks in and down to the basement without saying a
word Both pretend not to see or hear him She leaps up and
heads to the basement door

EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Romance her Wear a blue tie You
look so handsome in that blue tie

And she slams the basement door shut trapping her crazy
husband downstairs She seemed downright jolly about it

INT LIBRARY OF CONGRESS - NIGHT

Edgar (in his blue tie) and Helen are surrounded by THOUSANDS
OF BOOKS AND SHELVES standing in front of a MASSIVE FILING
SYSTEM in the dimly lit breathtaking heart of the Library
It’s romantic clandestine The only other person there is a
NIGHT GUARD well in the distance

YOUNG HOOVER
I helped develop it You see each
item is assigned an index card with
a completely unique code indicating
its topic title author and
location What took days to locate
now takes minutes Name a topic or
an author Anything

HELEN GANDRY
Indiscretion

YOUNG HOOVER
What era

HELEN GANDRY
Present day

YOUNG HOOVER
Time me

Edgar dives into the catalogue system Much like the blood
and briefcase at the Palmer house bombing we see this search
through Edgars mind The same LIT STRINGS appear momentarily
sending him to one row of files then one column then one
specific file LIT STRINGS appear and evaporate with the
splendor of lightening bugs on a southern summer

He pulls out a single card and flashes it to Helen She
giggles He leads her in his speedy way to a towering row of
book cases LIT STRINGS ARE EVERYWHERE all leading to a
single book He pulls it out CONTEMPORARY COURTSHIP

HELEN GANDY
(teasing)
How do you know I didn’t mean
POLITICAL indiscretion

YOUNG HOOVER
If you’d like to start over we can

HELEN GANDY
No This will do

YOUNG HOOVER
How long did I take

HELEN GANDRY
One minute ten seconds

YOUNG HOOVER
Imagine if every citizen in the
country was uniquely identifiable
(MORE)

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
with their own card and number
Say the pattern on their fingers
Imagine how quickly they could be
found when they committed a crime

He re-files the book clearly missing that she’s been
flirting She’s a little disappointed

HELEN GANDRY
It’s all very impressive John

YOUNG HOOVER
I’m sorry Should we go

HELEN GANDRY
It’s up to you

He knows what he needs to do And with his hands at his side
he leans in for a kiss It’s awkward Like a school boy

HELEN GANDRY (CONTD)
Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
Did I do something wrong

HELEN GANDRY
No But I’m not sure where you
think this is headed

YOUNG HOOVER
Right Of course

And with the precision of an army cadet he gets down on one
knee and grabs hold of her hand

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
Miss Gandy despite the brief time
we’ve known each other I feel
assured that you would make a fine
companion Your strength your
character your education--

HELEN GANDRY
Are you poking fun at me

YOUNG HOOVER
Of course not

HELEN GANDRY
Please stand up Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
(he does humiliated)
I would appreciate it if you didn’t
share this with the other women in
the typing pool

HELEN GANDRY
Of course not

YOUNG HOOVER
Would you mind telling me wh-wh-wh-
what f1--
(speeds up to kill the stutter)
flaw you’ve found in my character

HELEN GANDRY
No We just met

YOUNG HOOVER

(speedy defensive)
Of course But I’m a fast and
accurate judge of character We’ve
gone out three times Many people do
but I don’t It’s my most treasured
skill I see people right off for
what they are And please call me
Edgar It’s what my mother uses

HELEN GANDRY
Edgar can you keep a secret

YOUNG HOOVER
You have my word

HELEN GANDRY
I have no interest in getting
married My work comes first

YOUNG HOOVER
(bruised)
I see Then perhaps you’1l
consider the position of personal
secretary for the new radical
division In this moment of need
for our country

That’s a proposal she can accept He fights back the
humiliation chin up and makes a bee line out of there

INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE
This is Hoover’s small private office A RED BUZZER rings on
his desk He glares at it It buzzes again

OLD HOOVER
Miss Gandy

And an OLD HELEN GANDY walks in carrying files

OLD HOOVER (CONTD)
The nitwit Kennedy child rang his
baby buzzer again Perhaps he needs
a fresh diaper

Hoover takes her files and neatly orders them into his
private cabinet He locks it back

OLD HELEN GANDRY
Would you like me to find out what
the Attorney General needs

OLD HOOVER
I would like you to finish the
transcript from the Los Angeles
recording When you’re done we’1l
answer his buzzer

OLD HELEN GANDRY
Okay Edgar Agent Smith is back
He has questions about the Palmer
raids Should I tell him to go

OLD HOOVER
(lights up)
No Do you like him Helen

OLD HELEN GANDRY
I don’t have an opinion of him yet

OLD HOOVER
I like him I trust him

OLD HELEN GANDRY
I’ll set him up in your outer
office

OLD HOOVER
No Set him up a desk in here

INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE
Hoover is bright and cheery again as he spins a tale in his
rapid pace for the young FBI agent who sits typing away

OLD HOOVER
In 1920 we had no federal laws no
power no firearms and Congress
(MORE)

OLD HOOVER (CONTD)
liked it that way The criminals
ran free But there was no law
against keeping track of radicals
I compiled note cards on over 5000
names And called the one
Department that held a small piece
of untested power

AGENT SMITH
The Department of Labor The power
to deport sir

OLD HOOVER
But only to deport people who
checked two boxes They had to be
foreign citizens AND they had to
be working to harm the country

YOUNG FBI MAN
The Labor Department cooperated

OLD HOOVER
Of course not No one freely shares
power in Washington DC Agent Smith

INT DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OFFICE - DAY
Young Edgar sits behind Palmer who shakes EDGAR’S NOTE CARDS
bearing names of suspected radicals Edgar is in awe as his
mentor rants to the heads of the Labor Dept ABERCROMBIE and
CAMINETTI and their young LABOR DEPARTMENT LAWYER

MITCHELL PALMER
You mean to tell me there is no law
under which YOU can issue a warrant
for the arrest of an alien when L
certify that he is subject to
deportation

LABOR DEPT LAWYER
Without evidence Mr Attorney
General No There exists a Due
process of law sir

MITCHELL PALMER
Due process of law What about the
threat to our country

Edgar looks to an old man in the corner CAMINETTI A FREEZE
FRAME OF EDGAR’S POV OF CAMINETTI’S UNFLATTERING SCOWL

OLD HOOVER (VO)
But one of their heads A Mr
Caminetti well he WAS wary of
(MORE)

OLD HOOVER (VO) (CONTD)
our Justice Department but he
hated one person more--

EXT A PACKED HALL - 1919 - DAY

A fiery stout woman (hair up glasses on her nose) stands on
stage shaking her fist at a crowd of 3000 red-banner waving
slogan chanting Russians Jews Fins Poles Italians

EMMA GOLDMAN
I am a revolutionist by nature and
temperament and as such I claim the
right to rebel and resist invasion
by all means force included
consequently a destructionist

From a balcony Edgar listens jotting down notes

OLD HOOVER (VO)
--Emma Goldman hero of the radical
movement She was set to be
released from prison in two weeks
If I could hand CAMINETTI Emma
Goldman he’d deport her without a
thought We’d have our precedent

INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE
AGENT SMITH
But she was a citizen sir

Hoover has gone silent He’s focused on his frosted glass and
steel back door He watches the SILHOUETTE OF AN OLD MAN walk
past and pause He waits breathless The figure limps away
The sound of a door beyond his opens and closes

YOUNG FBI MAN
Would you like to stop sir

OLD HOOVER
No It’s hard for you to imagine
today but there was a time when
the average American feared for
their safety and survival In--

EXT CHICAGO SKYLINE - 1919 - NIGHT

The only thing lighting the city of Chicago is a half moon
and burning buildings

OLD HOOVER
--Chicago a coal strike started by
communists labor shut off all the
power Riots followed And on--

EXT CENTRALIA MAIN STREET IWW HALL - ARMISTICE DAY
A PARADE OF VETERANS march down a street lined with citizens
and boy scouts SHOTS RING OUT from a rooftop Onlookers
scream and scatter Bodies lie bleeding in the street

OLD HOOVER (VO)
--Armistice Day in Centralia
Illinois veterans fresh back from
War were murdered by radicals The
red revolution was on our soil

EXT NEW YORK CITY PRISON - NIGHT

Young Edgar in a long coat waits outside watching the faces
of the men who exit He approaches one posing as a fan

YOUNG HOOVER
Excuse me sir
(the man ignores him)
Is Mrs Goldman really in there

MAN AT JAIL
Who’s asking

YOUNG HOOVER
I’m a fan I’ve read your writing
as well Do you work with her

MAN AT JAIL
If you’re truly interested in the
Party then you shouldn’t be
stalking members on the streets
like a sycophant Come to a rally
Organize

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes sir But for now may I have
your autograph

Hoover holds out a newspaper with a story by the man
“Bolshevik America” The man autographs the article

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUREAU FILE ROOM
Edgar is with his new inner circle THREE HANDSOME AGENTS and
Helen Gandy WORKMEN are installing rows of filing cabinets

YOUNG HOOVER
We can’t take them down one by one
or they’1ll go underground and we’1l
find a bomb in every Senator’s
(MORE)
YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
mailbox It must be a simultaneous
raid Hitting all of them at once

An older agent with a BIG MUSTACHE has questions

MUSTACHED AGENT
And who are “they”

YOUNG HOOVER
That’s what you have to find out
We need a card on every radical
person in the country Who they
are where they live what they
say what group they belong to

MUSTACHED AGENT
Who have already committed crimes

YOUNG HOOVER
I care less if they’ve already
committed a crime and more if they
plan to

FBI AGENT 2
How many are on our team

YOUNG HOOVER
Only you four

HELEN GANDY
Ill have locks installed

YOUNG HOOVER
No locks That would draw
attention Nothing will be
alphabetically ordered The cards
will be broken down into subjects
and categories The system will be
simple enough if it’s been
explained If not finding
information will prove impossible
Trust no one Not even fellow
agents Half of our colleagues are
on both sides of the payroll

MUSTACHED AGENT
And the crimes we are investigating
aren’t crimes they are ideas

YOUNG HOOVER
If their idea is to come to this
country and plot the overthrow of our
government then that IS a crime

MUSTACHED AGENT
Mrs Goldman is not an alien She
married a US Citizen

Edgar opens the article he had autographed outside Prison

YOUNG HOOVER
The man she married hasn’t visited
her once in prison but the man
she’s lived with since her wedding
day visits her nightly

MUSTACHED AGENT
Smells like a Mitchell Palmer
publicity stunt to me Tell me
John what happens when we raid
this list of yours and we find
NOTHING No guns no bombs just
innocent people deported--

YOUNG HOOVER

(taking it personally)
From every corner of this nation
the American people have urged the
Attorney General to do something
about the violence and return the
United States to peace and glory I
am happy to send your objections to
Palmer himself but in the
meantime you will expose Miss
Goldman’s sham marriage and
change that suit of yours

FBI AGENT 1
Pardon me John

YOUNG HOOVER
(re his unfashionable suit)
Your suit Have some respect for
yourself and more importantly show
some respect to this Bureau

Edgar leaves the room in a huff The other agents turn away
from the challenging mustached Agent He’s played his hand

EXT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LOBBY - DAY

Edgar walks toward a group of press Writers Cameras all
waiting for him They eye him curiously who is this kid

YOUNG HOOVER
Today um upon her release Miss
Goldman was immediately served
(MORE)

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)

our information she is one of the
most dangerous anarchists in this
county

REPORTER
Yeah Who are you mister

YOUNG HOOVER
John John E Hoover

It’s not a home run but they scribble down his name
INT ELLIS ISLAND COURTROOM - DAY

An INSPECTOR oversees a formal examination Edgar hands him a
checklist of accusations and sits directly in front of a
tired looking Emma Goldman at a table filled with government
lawyers He examines her ill fitting “fraud of a dress” She
catches him doing it and is distracted

INSPECTOR SCHELL
Miss Goldman do you live with the
man you claim to be married to

EMMA GOLDMAN
I decline to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL
Are you aware the man who married
you had no authority to do so

EMMA GOLDMAN
I decline to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL
Miss Goldman are you an anarchist

EMMA GOLDMAN
I decline to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL
(growing frustrated)
Do you deny that you are an
anarchist

EMMA GOLDMAN
I decline to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL
Do you believe in the overthrow by
force or violence of the Government
of the United States

EMMA GOLDMAN
I refuse to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL
Do you advocate the assassination
of public officials

EMMA GOLDMAN
I refuse to answer

INSPECTOR SCHELL

(composes himself then)
This ALIEN has refused to answer
any questions pertaining to the
charges contained in the warrant
notwithstanding the fact that every
opportunity was afforded her I
recommend deportation

EDGAR’S POV of old Caminette’s face (earlier) Again THE
FRAME FREEZES THIS TIME ON HIS EQUALLY UNFLATTERING GRIN

OLD HOOVER (VO)
And just like that we had our
precedent
INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUREAU FILE ROOMS
The File room has grown exponentially The cabinets are
spilling over Edgar is pulling out cards There are LIGHT
STRING CONNECTIONS everywhere Helen Gandy interrupts
HELEN GANDY
Edgar Should I arrange our travel
to Paterson for Valentines Day

There’s trepidation in his pause Is this a romantic gesture

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes Of course Miss Gandy

EXT NEW YORK CITY RAIDS MONTAGE - 1920 - NIGHT

SET TO BOBBY BENTON’S 1963 hit “ROSES ARE RED (MY LOVE)” a
title card reads VALENTINES DAY 1920

An Army of 500 Police 35 troopers and bomb squad detectives
barge out of a station and fan out across Manhattan

EXT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLES HOUSE COMMUNITY CENTER - THAT NIGHT

FBI MEN in white shirts ties and winter coats and POLICEMAN
with copper badges and batons burst into a building They are

greeted with jeers taunts and bottles from the Russians and
anarchists inside

The batons come out Heads are split Students are pushed
down stairs bookcases are overturned there’s blood and
broken bones everywhere -- IT’S VIOLENT AND BLOODY

INT TRAIN BETWEEN DC AND PATERSON NJ -— THAT NIGHT

CLOSE ON A puff of smoke as Edgar lights up a cigarette to
try and calm his nerves Helen Gandy is sits next to him

YOUNG HOOVER
They found a counterfeiting press
five pistols two automatics And
in Trenton they found gunpowder
copper brass wire batteries-—-

HELEN GANDY
A bomb factory

YOUNG HOOVER
120 arrests in Detroit 41 in
Philadelphia 17 here so far

REVEAL On his lap are 33 more warrants “for subversive
radical activity” Can’t leave the work at the office

EXT NARROW CITY STREET NEW JERSEY - LATE THAT NIGHT

Black sedans drive slowly down the snow covered street Their
lights shut off and they coast to a stop Edgar and Helen’s
feet step out quietly But this is no date -- a dozen other
officers get out with them

A SECRET SERVICE OFFICER preps his ten men

SECRET SERVICE OFFICER
These men are armed violent and
prepared to kill to avoid capture--

Privately Edgar hands out firearms to SIX OF HIS MEN

FBI AGENT
Are we allowed to use these sir

YOUNG HOOVER
These are gifts from me to you
There is no law preventing us from
using our own weapons

Edgar can’t naturally handle a firearm He tucks it away
concealing it from a journalist and Miss Gandy who stand at a
remove

INT PRINTING PRESS NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER

Bureau Agents Secret Service and local cops burst through
the front door guns drawn It’s a classic raid

CHORUS OF OFFICERS
Hands in the air -- On the ground

THE RADICALS inside dive for cover reach for weapons or run
up stairs but they are quickly tackled beaten and pursued

One YOUNG RADICAL escapes up the stairs Two agents chase
him Edgar the last in the door slowly starts up the stairs
after them HE CAN HEAR A SCUFFLE It sounds violent He
slows his step and draws his gun

He reaches the door ready to fire the first shot of his
life but finds it’s not a scuffle at all The young radical
is being beaten within an inch of his life by the officers

Edgar watches He’s never seen such violence first hand Is
it revolting Titillating Both

YOUNG HOOVER
That’s enough

The room goes silent making the screaming downstairs seem
all the louder Edgar ignores it He’s focused on A PRINTING
PRESS in the corner -- AND A STACK OF PINK PAPER -- identical
to the color found the night of the Palmer house bombing A
STRING LIGHT FLASHES OUT THE WINDOW AND CONNECTS TO --

EXT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME - FLASHBACK
--all of the PINK PAPER at Palmer’s house months ago

Edgar has completed the circle -- Guns bombs and the
solution to the Palmer raid mystery The raids are a success

EXT ELLIS ISLAND HOLDING CELLLS - MIDNIGHT

Snow covers the ground Edgar is dressed warmly walking with
a congressman dignitaries and reporters

Hundreds of prisoners are being marched through the snow
single file to a gangplank and onto a tugboat Edgar watches
a tired filthy Emma Goldman struggle up the gangplank to the
tugboat and disappear

The camera reveals a massive rotting 5000 ton ship THE
BUFORD This won’t be a pleasant journey for the prisoners
Above them all looms the mighty Statue of Liberty

AGENT SMITH (VO)
But everyone in the Bureau involved
in those arrests lost their jobs
correct Even Palmer himself

OLD HOOVER (VO)
Most did And there is the lesson
The bombs stopped Peace came And
the American people forgot there
was ever a threat --

EXT ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S OFFICE
From afar Edgar watches assistants carry boxes out of his
boss’s office as Palmer takes a moment to assess his loss

OLD HOOVER
-- So when political adversaries
attacked Palmer in his run for the
White House when they attacked the
Bureau the country let it happen

Palmer feels eyes on him and looks up to Edgar
INT HOOVER’S INNNER OFFICE - DAY
YOUNG FBI MAN
But why Palmer and not you If you
orchestrated the raids

OLD HOOVER
(defensive a sore spot)
I was only twenty four years old I
was following orders Agent Smith

YOUNG FBI MAN
(regretting the question)
I understand sir

OLD HOOVER
But If we hadn’t of done it you may
very well have been born into a
communist State instead of the
country you love today am I right

YOUNG FBI MAN
Of course sir

A door opens across the hall Hoover looks up and sees the
earlier silhouette again limping toward his glass back door

OLD MAN’S VOICE
Edgar

OLD HOOVER
(quietly to Agent Smith)
Ignore him

OLD MAN’S VOICE
Edgar

OLD HOOVER
Mr Toulson I will be out ina
moment I am in a meeting

OLD MAN’S VOICE
Dont forget your appointment with
the Attorney General Edgar

OLD HOOVER
The file is not complete yet Mr
Toulson Go away

The casual familiarity of the exchange in front of Agent
Smith bothers Hoover

Smith is packing up Hoover extends his hand for a shake
apparently wanting to dispense with the earlier tension

AGENT SMITH
Thank you sir I apologize I will
finish this chapter tonight

OLD HOOVER
Very good Agent Smith

The Agent goes Hoover checks the hand he just shook with
The young agent’s palm was sweaty He seems heartbroken He
had truly liked Agent Smith--

INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
Hoover is in his outer office with a new agent AGENT JONES
22 He’s from Indiana He’s by the books

OLD HOOVER
Say I wanted to include the story of
how I became director Do they tell
that story in the Academy

AGENT JONES
Yes sir You were called into the
new Attorney General’s office—-

OLD HOOVER
Harlan Fiske Stone

AGENT JONES
Yes sir Attorney General Stone He
called you into his office and told
you to sit down sir

INT ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - 1924 - DAY

Young Edgar is let into HARLAN FISKE STONE’s office Stone is
60 an imposing figure at 6’6” and 260 lbs

HARLAN FISKE STONE
Sit down

Edgar does Stone examines him intently over his desk Edgar
calms his nerves by manically talking business

YOUNG HOOVER
Sir there are almost a dozen
vacancies in Chicago With the
robbery rate rising it would
actually profit the bureau to fill
these vacancies and start making
recoveries I have cabinets filled
with files on suspects and with a
Congressional hearing--

HARLAN FISKE STONE
Lower the treble son You didn’t
call this meeting I did

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes sir

HARLAN FISKE STONE
Everyone you’ve worked with here is
gone And there’s a reason for
that This Bureau is of exceedingly
bad odor Would you agree

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes sir

HARLAN FISKE STONE
And no offense but you seem to
have no social life no wife no
girlfriend and as far as I can
tell no pals at all

YOUNG HOOVER
That’s accurate sir

HARLAN FISKE STONE
And you’re shamelessly distracted
by this hodgepodge fingerprinting
affair

YOUNG HOOVER
It wouldn’t be a hodgepodge if we
could centralize the prints here

HARLAN FISKE STONE
It’s a speculative science at best

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes sir

HARLAN FISKE STONE
And why do they call you “Speed”

YOUNG HOOVER
Who calls me that

HARLAN FISKE STONE
They all do Behind your back
evidently

YOUNG HOOVER
(unaware covering)
Well S- S- Sir I earned a
reputation for delivering groceries
when I was ten years old I was the
fastest in the neighborhood It was
a nickname

HARLAN FISKE STONE
Are you sure it’s not for the way
you talk

YOUNG HOOVER
Perhaps sir

A long beat of silence Edgar is ready and willing to be
fired -- if only to stop the humiliation Instead

HARLAN FISKE STONE
Young man I want you to be acting
director of the Bureau of
Investigation

Edgar absorbs the unexpected good news covers his shock
looks back across the desk at Stone’s imposing forehead

and

YOUNG HOOVER
Ill take the job Mr Stone But
only on certain conditions

Stone gives a quizzical look How dare he name conditions

HARLAN FISKE STONE
What are they

YOUNG HOOVER

(as if prepared)
The Bureau must be divorced from
politics and not be a catch-all
for political hacks Recruits must
be college educated Appointments
must be based on merit Promotions
will be made only on proven
ability And the bureau will be
responsible only to you sir the
Attorney General

HARLAN FISKE STONE
(a beat then)
I wouldn’t give you the job under
any other conditions
(cutting Edgar off)
That’s all Good day

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FBI OFFICE
All of the agents in the FBI are lined up in two long never
ending rows facing each other Edgar walks down the long
isle between them shaking each Agent’s hand

YOUNG HOOVER
I am determined to summarily
dismiss from this Bureau any
employee whom I find indulging in
the use of intoxicants I--

He gets to a chubby agent shakes his hand Sweat He turns
to Helen beside him She takes note He continues indicating
each man with a bald spot each man not neatly dressed

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
--believe that when a man becomes a
part of this Bureau he must so
conduct himself both officially
and unofficially as to eliminate
the slightest possibility of
criticism as to his conduct

He stops at a handsome linebacker of an agent with dark hair
RAYMOND CAFFREY 29

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
And your name Sir

RAYMOND CAFFREY
Agent Caffrey Sir

YOUNG HOOVER
What is your assignment

RAYMOND CAFFREY
Special Agent to Kansas City
aiding in the search for escaped
murdered Frank Nash Sir

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s dangerous work But when you
return you will be rewarded for
you service to our country

Edgar shakes his hand This is the kind of Agent he wants in
his Bureau (and his dinner table) Next to him though is the
MUSTACHED AGENT who challenged Edgar during the Palmer raids

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
You still fancy facial hair Agent
Stokes

MUSTACHED AGENT
The ladies appreciate it

YOUNG HOOVER
And the ladies’ opinions’ are more
important than the Bureau’s

MUSTACHED AGENT
No sir

YOUNG HOOVER
Mr Stokes perhaps you are better
suited for the Police force than
the Bureau of Investigations

MUSTACHED AGENT
Ive been here seven years Edgar
As long as you

YOUNG HOOVER
No You were with the old bureau
seven years That bureau is gone

INT BASEMENT BED - (HOOVER’S MIND)

Edgar stands above his emaciated father examining him with
scientific curiosity The man’s eyes open wide lock on his
son and he lets out a TERRIFYING SCREAM Edgar bears it
Silence His father dies his jaw still ajar mid scream

INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME HOOVERS BEDROOM - DAY

A WORKMAN is installing a personal telephone line into
Edgar’s childhood (and current) bedroom Dressed all in
black Edgar supervises from the doorway

WORKMAN
Why the phone in your son’s room
and not in the master bedroom

YOUNG HOOVER
I’m paying you to put in a line
not ask questions
And Edgar pulls out a pack of LUCKY STRIKES

EXT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
Edgar and his NEICE 12 (also in black) are smoking
YOUNG NEICE
I thought Lucky Strikes were only

for girls

YOUNG HOOVER
You thought wrong Hold it in your
lungs or it’1l do you no good

Bouncing up the street in a bonnet holding a mass of shopping
bags (and not in black at all) is Edgar’s mother

INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
Edgar’s mother spins around in a new dress
HOOVER’S MOTHER
I had two made Same cut different
pattern And two suits for you

They’1l be delivered on Friday

Edgar sits down at the dinner table At his place is a
sapphire ring He examines it She cozies up

EDGAR’S MOTHER
It’s platinum Six diamonds and a
star sapphire I’ve told everyone
in the neighborhood They all know

YOUNG HOOVER
What about the funeral for father

EDGAR’S MOTHER
(serves up some pot roast)
There’s no time for that now

YOUNG HOOVER
I shouldn’t mother I’ve been
gaining weight

EDGAR’S MOTHER
It’s solid weight There’s nothing
wrong with solid weight on a man
I’m so incredibly proud of you
Edgar

She pulls out a clipped newspaper article It’s small barely
a mention but it announces his new job

EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
I’m starting an album for you I’m
going to put everything in it This
is just the beginning

He slips the sapphire ring on his finger -- where it will
remain the rest of his life

INT MAYFLOWER HOTEL LOUNGE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Edgar holds court at his corner table with SPECIAL AGENT
CHARLES APPEL and another handsome agent The wait staff pays
them special attention but Edgar doesn’t notice He has his
eye on a GROUP OF YOUNG MEN celebrating at the bar

Edgar is focused on a tall slender SHARPLY DRESSED MAN
Trouble is another man in the group LAWRENCE RICHEY knows
Edgar and waves Edgar returns the gesture but feels

caught His discomfort doubles when Richey heads toward him --
THE SHARPLY DRESSED MAN JUST BEHIND (CLYDE TOULSON 28)

LAWRENCE RICHEY
Mr Hoover Good to see you I’d
like to introduce you to Mr Clyde
Toulson He graduated from George
Washington University Tonight With
a law degree
YOUNG HOOVER
Congratulations Mr Toulson

YOUNG TOULSON
(the quiet type)
Thank you I believe you’re one of
our most distinguished Alumni

YOUNG HOOVER
I did yes I do have a
degree from the school Yes
(an awkward beat covering)
I was just admiring your suit Mr
Toulson You could take a lesson
from him Lawrence

YOUNG TOULSON
It’s a custom cut From Garfinkel’s
Department store sir

YOUNG HOOVER
Do you have a card Mr Toulson

YOUNG TOULSON
I do Of course

Clyde hands his card to Edgar Edgar looks it over hands
Clyde his own card and just as quickly goes back to his meal
-- as if he never paid Clyde any special attention

YOUNG TOULSON (CONT’D)
Thank you sir

INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Helen and Edgar are going through applications One pile for

interviews one for rejects The reject pile is

HELEN GANDY
(rvedacting an application)
Well educated Highly recommended
Willing to guarantee five years
service Has a family in New
York And a new baby

YOUNG HOOVER
No interview

HELEN GANDY
The family in New York or the baby

stacked high
YOUNG HOOVER
Five years is not enough We want
men willing to dedicate their
lives How many is that so far

HELEN GANDY
320 denied and 21 interviews

YOUNG HOOVER
Did you receive an application from
a Mr Toulson

HELEN GANDY

(finds the report wary)
Yes His report states he “has
confidence poise his diction is
excellent” But “Although
physically fitted for it might be
displeased with rugged work” His
only interest in the Bureau is to
gain experience that would benefit
a private law practice And he has
no interest in being here for any
period of time which would
“Render employment speculative”

She waits for him to say “No interview” but he doesn’t

HELEN GANDY (CONT’D)
He did receive a letter of
recommendation from the executive
assistant of the Secretary of War

YOUNG HOOVER
That’s fantastic Miss Gandy

HELEN GANDY
He well mentions here that Mr
Toulson “Showed no particular
interest in women”

It’s 1930s code for gay She offers a bright side

HELEN GANDY (CONT’D)
Then again some of our best agents
excel because they have no
family incumbrance

YOUNG HOOVER
You’re right Bring him in for an
interview

Helen adds him to the yes stack Edgar tries to change the
subject

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
The problem Miss Gandy is that
these men don’t look up to me

HELEN GANDY
Of course they do

YOUNG HOOVER
I don’t mean figuratively I mean
They don’t look UP to me

He doesn’t want to be any clearer than that It’s too
sensitive a subject -- he’s shorter than most

HELEN GANDY
Well if you could conduct the
entire interview from behind your
desk instead of walking about the
office I could correct that

YOUNG HOOVER

(considers it then)
Miss Gandy say I had private
information on someone in a position
of power Harmful information Now
Destroying information goes against
my nature but I don’t trust it in
the general files either Could I
trust it with you If we created a
confidential file

HELEN GANDY
of course Edgar

And with that he slides his first “Private and Confidential”
file across his desk to her IT’S MARKED “ELEANOR ROOSEVELT”
She sets it carefully in her lap

MATCH CUT TO
EXT ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY’S OFFICE - DAY
OLD Miss Gandy sits outside the AG’s office with A STACK OF

SIMILAR FILES IN HER LAP She patronizes ROBERT KENNEDYS
SECRETARY with a smile

INT ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Kennedy stands by a window pensive A FILE sits casually on
the corner of his desk Hoover is relaxed in a chair focused
on a FIREPLACE in the office He breaks the silence

OLD HOOVER
Was the fireplace always here or
did you have it put in

ROBERT F KENNEDY
It was put in What were you
doing with wire-taps in that house

OLD HOOVER
You asked that I pursue this
“Organized Crime” element Mr
Kennedy and that’s what I did
With diligence Do you use the
fireplace

ROBERT F KENNEDY
Rarely Who else has heard the
recording

OLD HOOVER
Ive filed this matter “Personal
and Confidential” I’m the only one
with access to it

ROBERT F KENNEDY
Mr Hoover I asked you to pursue a
real threat Instead you have
publicly denied the existence of
Organized Crime and now this gross
display of intimidation

OLD HOOVER
Sir I was only following orders
We bugged the basement of a home in
Los Angeles that is a known
gathering place for lawbreakers
How was I to know that a criminal’s
girlfriend and an east German
communist would be down there
having sex with your brother the
President of the United States Do
not shoot the messenger sir I am
here to protect you both

ROBERT F KENNEDY
What do you want from me

OLD HOOVER
If this information was discovered
by the public it would create wide
spread distrust in your brothers
leadership ability and before all
else I hold the well being of our
Country paramount

ROBERT F KENNEDY
So how may I HELP you Mr Hoover

OLD HOOVER
If I am to pursue the elements you
consider a threat I humbly request
that you allow me the same power
and access to follow the groups I
see as IMMEDIATE threats

ROBERT F KENNEDY
It’s not 1920 anymore

OLD HOOVER
Do you know who Stanley Levinson is

ROBERT F KENNEDY
A lawyer

OLD HOOVER

A white communist lawyer who is
organizing at the highest levels
Including the SCLC His group is
growing their aim is entirely self
serving and their leadership is
openly critical of this Department
Have you read the clippings I sent

ROBERT F KENNEDY
I can’t say I have

Hoover pulls out the critical newspaper clippings (the ones
that made him sweat in the opening scene)

OLD HOOVER
They claim we are “Unable to get
convictions in even the most
heinous crimes” and that we have
“Faltered under the pressure
complexities and responsibilities
of our office” In PRINT in the New
York Times

ROBERT F KENNEDY
You can’t bear a little criticism

OLD HOOVER
It depends on what their aim is
They are gaining considerable
power their priorities are
singularly focused on their own
issues and they are trying to
incite revolt

ROBERT F KENNEDY
Frankly they sounds more critical
of your office than mine There’s
a new face to communism Edgar and
this isn’t it Communism is a
foreign threat now Not domestic

OLD HOOVER
Mr Kennedy Before you were even
born I heard that very same
argument from a Mr Mitchell
Palmer And do you know what it
took to change his mind A bomb If
he had sat in his smoking chair
five more minutes that night in
1919 we would have been lucky to
have found an intact index finger
I do not want to see that happen to
you or your brother

(attempting a conciliatory tone)
There’s no reason we can’t both get
what we want We can wage a war on
two fronts sir

ROBERT F KENNEDY
You can go now And please leave
the transcripts with me

OLD HOOVER
Yes sir Feel free to share them
with your brother I have a copy of
my own in safe keeping

And with that threat Hoover walks toward the door stops at
the fireplace inspects it and goes a smile creeping into
the corners of his mouth The rhythm of his shoes on the
flooring cross the cut matching the rhythm of--

INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE —- DAY
--Young Edgar doing push ups in his office with the window
open to let in air and dry his brow FOOTSTEPS

Edgar takes a handkerchief from his pocket and dabs his brow
but he’s not sweating

MISS GANDY
Your four o’clock is here sir

He hurries to close the window but the curtain gets stuck
the window jams and the handkerchief falls from his pocket
He heads for his desk His office door opens Miss Gandy lets
in the next applicant it’s dapper Clyde Toulson (earlier)

YOUNG HOOVER
Have a seat Mr Toulson

Edgar rounds his desk and STEPS UP ONTO A NEW SMALL PLATFORM
TO MAKE HIM TALLER Clyde smiles trying to relieve Edgars
embarrassment He steps toward the desk and extends a hand

YOUNG TOULSON
Mr Hoover thank you for this
opportunity

A SIDE SHOT reveals Edgar standing on his riser still not
quite as tall as Clyde They shake hands

YOUNG HOOVER
Please Take a seat

YOUNG TOULSON
Thank you sir

YOUNG HOOVER
There are several problems with
your application Mr Toulson not
the least of which is you do not
show the required dedication to the
bureau nor the dedication t--

As Edgar rattles he watches Clyde’s eyes Clyde sees the
curtain stuck in the window He sees the handkerchief on the
floor and the spot of sweat forming on Edgar’s brow

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)

(speeds up to stop stuttering)
the protection of the American
people and the American way This
is NO platform to a fatter paycheck
in private practice

We see what Edgar sees LIGHT STRINGS connect the evidence
Clyde is looking at It seems to Edgar that Clyde can see the
strings as well It’s frightening invasive titillating --

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
Is there something the matter Mr
Toulson

YOUNG TOULSON
Is exercise a requirement for all
Agents Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
(busted )
All agents must be in excellent
physical condition We must out
match and out wit the public enemy
at every turn

YOUNG TOULSON
What kind of routine do you do

YOUNG HOOVER
(making it up)
Sit ups push ups squatting

YOUNG TOULSON
How about chin ups

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes Of course

YOUNG TOULSON
I see Would you like me to fix the
curtain Mr Hoover Or perhaps
open the window I always enjoy the
air after exercise Don’t you sir

YOUNG HOOVER
If it would please you

And Clyde carefully and expertly removes the curtain from the
window bends over plucks up the handkerchief off the floor
and returns it to Edgar’s desk

YOUNG TOULSON
Where I may fall short in terms of
resume I apparently far exceed the
rest in terms of honesty I did not
lie to get this interview Like the
rest I WOULD like to start a
private practice eventually but I
could be persuaded otherwise if the
right opportunity arose

EXT GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Edgar steps out of a limousine and walks into the department
store Clyde gets out behind him and follows him in

INT GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE MONTAGE - DAY

Edgar is measured for a suit -- Clyde supervises fabric
choices -- Clyde pulls out ties and shoes -- Edgar tries on a
3-PIECE-SUIT It’s the first time we’ve seen him this put
together He looks like the “Hoover” the world now knows

INT GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER

Edgar is with a clerk his items laid out on a counter Clyde
is at a remove Something’s wrong Things get uncomfortable
when the department store CREDIT DIRECTOR appears

CREDIT DIRECTOR
Are you Mr John Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
I am Is there a problem

CREDIT DIRECTOR
It seems there’s a Mr John Hoover
whose credit has gone bad with us
That would appear to be you

YOUNG HOOVER
(quiet humiliated)
That’s not me On my word My
parents call me Edgar my niece
calls me JE And I sign John E
not John

CREDIT DIRECTOR
Sir may I suggest you choose ONE
name and re-apply

He presents a new application Edgar looks at the blank NAME

square -- the more dapper look he’1ll carry the rest of his

life Helen Gandy greets him with a grim face

YOUNG HOOVER

EXT KANSAS CITY TRAIN STATION (FLASHBACK) - DAY

GUN FIRE AND SMOKE Cars screech to a halt Passengers run
for their lives Police officers scramble for cover

A VOICE
Let ‘em have it

A MAN WITH A MACHINE GUN beside a Plymouth starts firing on

fire The two cops immediately fall to the ground dead

A MAN catches a bullet in his arm He drops to the ground and
scrambles to the side of a Chevy TOWARD AGENT CAFFREY(The
dark haired linebacker of an agent Edgar complimented
earlier)

Caffrey scrambles to the driver’s side of his Chevrolet to
provide safe haven for the wounded man but he’s cut short as
A BULLET BLASTS THROUGH HIS HEAD

been beaten back but--

But like communism America didn’t
react with scorn they gave the
American gangster their admiration

making the perfect stage A makeup woman powders his nose

Old Hoover is again talking to Agent Jones -- who is more
focused on the WORKMEN DEMOLISHING HOOVER’S BACK WALL

OLD HOOVER
But that summer a single crime
opened the door to set things
right Do you know what that was
Mr Jones

AGENT JONES
(distracted)
I’m sorry sir what was that

OLD HOOVER
Who is the most famous man of the

AGENT JONES
Joe McCarthy sir

Hoover clearly disapproves This guy is toast
INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Hoover is focused on the bald spot forming on the crown of
the Agent’s head That and the sweat are deal breakers

INT HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE —- DAY
Hoover is with yet another Agent AGENT GARRISON This one is
very young and handsome with a North Carolina accent

Well I suppose his notoriety
depends on the field he is in

You have to find him Edgar He has
to be brought home alive

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes mother

EXT THE LINBERG’S HOME NEW JERSEY - DAYBREAK

Edgar and Clyde arrive at the Lindbergh home a big white
house in the middle of a field All around are POLICE CARS
and GIANT LAMPS that must have burnt all night

Like the Palmer crime scene Edgar looks for clues little
LIGHT STRINGS making connections AN OFFICER talks AT Clyde

NJ OFFICER
This morning alone we’ve heard from
the Pennsylvania railroad Will
Rogers President Hoover Governor
Roosevelt the Customs Department
the US Mail and the Boy Scouts--

EDGAR WATCHES THE NJ POLICE trudge around an area under an
opened upstairs window He shouts out

YOUNG HOOVER
All of you Get off of that dirt
You are trampling evidence

Colonel Shwartzkoff (clearly the one in charge) approaches

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
There’s nothing there No defined
footprints It seems he was wearing
fabric on his shoes

YOUNG HOOVER
And you don’t think the size of the
print may have held some value
(re the upstairs window)
And how did he get up there Are
there marks on the window and wall
you’re erasing as well

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
There was a ladder We found it a
hundred yards away in three pieces
We moved it inside

YOUNG HOOVER
You moved it

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
Yes For safe keeping

YOUNG HOOVER
Congratulations You’ve completely
contaminated the crime scene Now

(MORE)

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
if you please get your boots off
of this property Mr Shwartzkoff

OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
What right do you have to be here
Mr

YOUNG TOULSON
J Edgar Hoover Director of the
FBI We have been sent by President
Hoover himself to make sure this
crime is resolved successfully

YOUNG HOOVER
The President has authorized access
to all documents and evidence--

OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
Mr Hoover you are free to
observe but New Jersey is not the
President’s domain

YOUNG HOOVER
Where is Mr Lindbergh I’d like to
hear his opinion on the matter

INT THE LINDBERGH HOME GARAGE - LATER

Surrounded by workmen installing a bank of phone lines Edgar
hovers over THE LADDER it’s home-made each of it’s three
pieces measure 805 inches We see Edgar’s LIT STRINGS as he
makes connections -- the sections must have fit neatly into
each other to form a 20 foot ladder that would collapse to 6

A side-rail on the center section has split along the grain

YOUNG HOOVER
He fell five feet

CHARLES LINDBERGH
Who did

Reveal CHARLES LINDBERGH dressed well but bearing the signs
of no sleep He seems interested in what Edgar has to say

YOUNG HOOVER
The kidnapper with the child in
his arms sir

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
That’s speculation Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
Mr Lindbergh sir if it had split
on the way up it would have
collapsed It was a miscalculation
Built to bear the weight of a man
going up but not the weight of a
man and a child coming down

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
We have other theories

YOUNG HOOVER
(annoyed but careful in
front of Lindbergh)
And the ransom note May I see the
note please Mr Shwartzkoff

Shwartzcoff pulls it out and hesitantly offers it up

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
Youve been touching it with your
bare hands as well

OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
We checked There were none of the
“finger imprints” you fancy so
valuable Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
None YOU could find perhaps Would
you please put it down

A moment of eye contact between Edgar and Lindbergh then as
Edgar reads it we see all the clues the distinct spacing
spelling and grammar GLOWING IN HOOVER’S TRADEMARK MANNER

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
“Have 5000 redy we will inform
you were to deliver the Mony We
warn you for making anyding public
or for notify the police Indication
for all letters are SINGnature” S-I-
N-G SING-nature “And 3 holes”

And the camera zeros in on the THREE HOLED SYMBOL the
kidnapper made in the bottom corner of the letter

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
I want this letter And the ladder

COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
(leans in close)
There is no Federal jurisdiction

for It’s time for you to go

Edgar looks to Lindbergh who is examining the letter now He
seems exhausted helpless unsure of who to trust

I’m afraid for his boy

YOUNG TOULSON
He trusts the local police more
than us

YOUNG HOOVER
No He thinks we’re ALL fools
He’1ll go around them too He’1l
bargain with the kidnappers

INT US CONGRESS - DAY

Edgar sits with Clyde before a Senate Committee He’s a
brilliant speaker never looking down never pausing

YOUNG HOOVER
President Hoover called me the
morning the child was taken and
asked that I do whatever was in my
power to help solve this crime But
do you know what ALL OF THE POWER
OF THE FBI means without federal
laws Without arms Without the
power to make arrests It means
nothing If we are one nation under
God then we should have a force
that can aid every state in this
nation and stop the wave of crime
that is pulling us into chaos Mr
Chairman I urge passage of the
Lindbergh Law making kidnapping a
FEDERAL offense To immediately
deliver every finger print in the
country to my office so that we may
have a central file To arm our
agents so that we have a fighting
chance against their sub-machine
guns I urge you to do this in the
name of little Lindy Because if he
can be taken then what child is
safe And if we cannot aid in his
safe return then what use are we

It’s a smashing success of a speech
INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE — DAY

Edgar watches from a window as trucks in the courtyard unload
massive files Something weighs on him

HELEN GANDY
What is it Edgar

YOUNG HOOVER
The rest of the Fingerprints from
Leavenworth and Chicago

She waits He turns That’s not what she meant

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
Our new President has scheduled a
meeting There’s talk of re-
organizing the FBI

HELEN GANDY
I’ve heard similar whispers

YOUNG HOOVER
Do you remember the file we built
on his wife Miss Gandy Would you
make a copy for me

He looks out the window and steps out onto the balcony
EXT HOOVER’S BALCONY — CONTINUOUS

Edgar puts on a big smile Down below on Pennsylvania Avenue
is Roosevelt’s inaugural parade Edgar WAVES DOWN to
Roosevelt as his car passes then heads back inside

INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - (APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS)
As if a continuous (but 32 years later) Hoover comes in off
the balcony He is greeted by his young writer Two workers
at the far end are now building the FACADE OF A NEW
FIREPLACE It looks identical to Kennedy’s

OLD HOOVER
Lindbergh hired criminals to look
for his son He even got an offer
from Al Capone to help pay the
ransom And he employed an eccentric
by the name of John Condon whod
placed a newspaper ad to act as a go-
between between with the kidnappers

AGENT GARRISON
Was Condon a criminal too

INT THE LINDBERGH HOME NURSERY - NIGHT
A white haired JOHN CONDON is escorted in and up to Lindy’s
crib It hasn’t been disturbed since the kidnapping night
Pins still hold the covers down The window is still ajar

Mr Lindbergh walks into the room

CHARLES LINDBERGH
Mr Condon You say the kidnappers
responded to your ads

CONDON
(hands over two letters)
Twice now I will reply in the
newspaper if you’1l allow it Did
he leave the note in the crib

CHARLES LINDBERGH
No On the window sill

Condon looks at the pins securing the blankets in the crib

CONDON
These pins are unique

CHARLES LINDBERGH
My wife uses them to hold the
covers in place Our son had a cold
when he was taken

CONDON
Can I take them with me

CHARLES LINDBERGH
(not sure of this man)
Why are you doing this

CONDON
So a mother may have her child
again and that you may know that
the American people are grateful
for the honor bestowed upon them by
your pluck and daring

CHARLES LINDBERGH
How do we know these letters of
yours are from the kidnapper
CONDON
The symbol matches the original
letter’s symbol doesn’t it
(silence)
What is it Mr Lindbergh

CHARLES LINDBERGH
In a moment of thoughtlessness I
showed the symbol to some other men
who had offered to help I’m not
sure they were trustworthy I’m not
sure anyone is trustworthy anymore
Mr Condon You should know that I
have decided to have your letters
analyzed to see if they are truly
from the same author

INT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S PRIVATE LIBRARY — DAY

Edgar storms into a law book jammed room with a studious
looking man MR ALBERT S OSBORNE and several agents

YOUNG HOOVER
Clear all of these tables

YOUNG AGENT
Where do we put the books sir

YOUNG HOOVER
Out of my sight Mr Osborne
what do you need from us

ALBERT S OSBORNE
Bright lights A microscope
Measuring instruments Magnifying
glasses a projector

YOUNG HOOVER
You have the full resources of the
Bureau Don’t be shy a child’s
life depends on this

ALBERT S OSBORNE
Okay Paper samples from every
regional manufacturer

YOUNG HOOVER
Mr Toulson you will get Mr
Osborne whatever he needs to
conclude without a doubt that these
letters come from the same author

And with that Edgar puts the three Lindbergh notes on the
now book cleared table Lindbergh has handed them over

EXT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S PRIVATE LIBRARY —- LATER

Clyde stands with an impatient Edgar outside the makeshift
lab A SIGN indicates this is the Attorney General’s library

YOUNG TOULSON
Should we tell the Attorney General

YOUNG HOOVER
So he can say “no” for the third
time Just post a sign

YOUNG TOULSON
To say what “Keep out”

YOUNG HOOVER
No “FBI Crime Laboratory” Have it
carved in wood and nailed in If he
wants it gone he can pull it out
himself It’s time we have at least
one thing the bad guys don’t

YOUNG TOULSON
Decorating skills

YOUNG HOOVER
Science Clyde

Albert Osborne walks out of his lab Edgar perks up

ALBERT S OSBORNE
The ink is different but the
handwriting is a match Whoever Mr
Condon is corresponding with IS the
person who wrote the original note

YOUNG HOOVER
OR Condon wrote all the notes
himself

YOUNG TOULSON
Lindbergh is planning to deliver
the ransom money through Condon It
may have already happened

YOUNG HOOVER
Call the Internal Revenue Service
Get them to Lindbergh’s home I
insist those bills be marked

Edgar starts down the hall Albert stops him with

ALBERT S OSBORNE
Is that all Mr Hoover I have a
230PM class to teach

YOUNG HOOVER
No you don’t Consider your pay
doubled You work for your country
now Mr Osborne

EXT GRAVEYARD GATES JEROME AVENUE - NIGHT
Condon waits at the FRONT GATE rereading his instructions

A MAN approaches but walks right by Condon checks his
watch 915 PM He considers then starts to leave As he
does he sees a WHITE HANDKERCHIEF being waved from inside
the cemetary through the bars of the gate

Condon approaches The man is in an overcoat with a fedora
covering his eyes the handkerchief now over his nose and
mouth Each time Condon nears he darts behind a gravestone
pulling Condon deeper and deeper into the graveyard Finally
the man shouts out in a German accent

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
Have you gotted the money

CONDON
I can’t bring the money until I’ve
seen the baby

Both men hear FOOTSTEPS The man jumps a fence and runs

CONDON (CONTD)
I promise you there are no police

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
(shouts back as he runs)
It’s too dangerous

The footsteps turn out to be those of a NIGHT GUARD Condon
waits for him to pass then pursues the man deep into the
park Out of breath and ready to collapse Condon slows his
pace So does the man with the handkerchief

CONDON
No one will hurt you

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
If they catch me they will
CONDON
They only want the child

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
They’1l give me thirty years if I’m
caught They could burn me

CONDON
No

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
I didn’t do it I am only the
messenger

He slowly approaches Condon Condon braces himself

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD (CONTD)
What if the baby is dead Would I
burn if the baby is dead

CONDON
Why would we be meeting if the baby
was dead

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
He’s not He’s treated well Better
than the diet in the newspaper ad
his mother put down But would I
burn if I did not kill it

CONDON
No And you’ve seen the child

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
You gotted my letter with the
SINGnature It is the same like the
letter with the SINGnature which
was left in the baby’s crib

CONDON
In the crib

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
Yes

Condon was told differently He pulls the pins from the
baby’s crib from his pocket

CONDON
Do you recognize these

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
Those are from the baby’s crib

CONDON
So you were there Yourself

MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
(feeling busted he flees)
Place another ad in the paper when
you have the money

And with that the man vanishes
INT LINDBERGH’S HOME GARAGE -— NIGHT

Condon and Lindbergh are with an officious little IRS man
ELMER IREY Edgar Clyde and AGENT SISK watch him record the
numbers off each gold markered bill onto a ledger

CHARLES LINDBERGH
I thought gold notes were going out
of circulation Mr Irey

ELMER IREY
That’s our hope It will make these
bills more identifiable

CHARLES LINDBERGH
I have no need to pursue the money
Mr Hoover I only want my son

YOUNG HOOVER
This isn’t just for your Lindy
sir I’ve already assigned a 26 man
team lead by Special Agent Sisk
here to pursue the case If we let
these people go free no child will
be safe

CHARLES LINDBERGH
If they find out you’re involved I
may never see my son again

YOUNG HOOVER
We won’t pursue a single lead until
your child is in his mother’s arms
You have my word

INT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Sitting in the audience Edgar watches a newsreel fire up
It’s a plea for the safe return of “Little Lindy” featuring
the happy curly headed toddler at his parent’s estate

Edgar looks to his left to his mother a tear on her cheek

INT HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME —- NIGHT

Edgar’s mother walks in sits on the edge of Hoover’s bed
and wakes him Only half awake he seems very boyish

split your skull open and were
left to die under a tree You were
found by two farmers passing on the
highway What trouble are you in

Condon walks alone The night is dark and there is only the
occasional passerby He’s been waiting for a while Finally

REVEAL This is Lindbergh’s POV from a Ford down the block
He hears the voice He watches Condon talk to the man from
afar and then dissapear with him

EXT A CITY STREET NEAR RAYMOND CEMETARY - LATER

Condon runs out of the cemetary and up to the driver’s side
door Lindbergh doesn’t see his child

CONDON
I talked him out of 20000 dollars

CHARLES LINDBERGH
I‘d prefer him happy than save the
money Mr Condon I don’t want to
upset him

CONDON
I’m sorry sir

Lindbergh again sees the man with the handkerchief This time
far in the distance Lindbergh hands Condon the BOX OF MONEY

LINDBERGH’S POV Condon returns to the man hands him the box
with his left hand and accepts an envelope with his right

The man kneels down and inspects the money Stands shakes
Condon’s hand blows his nose drops the handkerchief and
disappears Condon makes it back to the car

CHARLES LINDBERGH
The baby Where is the baby

CONDON
(hands over the envelope)
I promised to wait six hours before
opening it

CHARLES LINDBERGH
Get in

Condon gets in They drive away in silence Charles resists
opening the envelope but he can’t He tears it open

Garrison goes but not before noting the familiarity between
Toulson and Hoover Once alone with Toulson and Helen

HELEN GANDY
The Attorney General has authorized
your wire taps

OLD HOOVER
Very good Miss Gandy

OLD TOULSON
(not so pleased)
Are you sure you want this Once
you do it it’s done

OLD HOOVER
And when I prove myself correct we
will have saved this country
another radical revolution History
will remember that

OLD TOULSON
And if you’re wrong history will
judge it an illegal move over a
petty grudge

OLD HOOVER

Is our reputation petty to you Mr
Toulson Order the wires

OLD TOULSON
Can we discuss it over dinner

OLD HOOVER
After you order the wires

He sees the tension in Hoover’s face the doubt Helen goes

Edgar and Clyde have settled in to their booth

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s the same dance each time They
make me wait They imagine I’m
sweating that they’re showing me
who’s boss And I play along

YOUNG TOULSON
Did you play him the tape

YOUNG HOOVER
No The transcript But he didn’t
want to read it That was unique
He wanted me to tell him about it

YOUNG TOULSON
How you came across it

YOUNG HOOVER
No I explained up front we had
never expected to find Mrs
Roosevelt in the bedroom of a known
communist agitator Much less
having what sounded like an
intimate moment

(MORE)

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
(anxious laugh)
And that I needed his guidance in
how to proceed I wanted him to
know he had an ally

YOUNG TOULSON
Before he had a chance to ask you
to resign

YOUNG HOOVER
Exactly but when I was done he
simply pushed the file aside He
seemed unconcerned with it

States is afraid

YOUNG TOULSON
Afraid of you

Of course Mr Hoover

Clyde gives Edgar a look This is unusual

YOUNG TOULSON
You’re drinking now

YOUNG HOOVER
Were celebrating I feel I can
trust you with anything Clyde--

YOUNG TOULSON
Id like to think so

YOUNG HOOVER
(a big secret)
The President signed a secret order
granting me increased power of
surveillance Secret surveillance
of Communists and Radicals Without
warrant

YOUNG TOULSON
Is that legal

YOUNG HOOVER
Sometimes we have to break the
rules if we are going to keep our
country safe

Agreed
(searching Clyde’s eyes)
I want to ask you something

YOUNG TOULSON
Feel free

what’s at stake who I can trust
An Associate Director of the FBI
I know you’ve only been with us 12
months

(strangely intimate)
Youre missing my point Clyde I
want you to be my number two man

YOUNG HOOVER
I need you Clyde

The body was blackened the left
leg missing from the knee down A
visible fracture on the skull He’d
suffered a violent blow to the
head I told them months ago he
must have fallen on the way down
with the baby in his arms

She turns her head clearly in pain Clearly quite ill

grew to diabolical proportions

hands On your hands Edgar

Edgar is horrified at the idea but believes it deeply

AS BEFORE Edgar walks down the hall toward the press This

reporter who seems less than impressed

Clyde has pulled the disinterested reporter aside for a
private chat with Edgar

How many more pieces can I run on

relatives I need something fresh

YOUNG TOULSON
And if the director gives you a
piece of information exclusively
how does the country benefit

REPORTER
The country

A story on the FBI
(reading Edgar)
On its young director

YOUNG HOOVER
What angle

REPORTER
(considers then )
With the inescapable demise of the
American Outlaw the new American
hero is the FBI

YOUNG HOOVER
A story or a cover story

REPORTER
I can’t promise a cover But I have
a pal in the radio business if
you’re willing to share true life
stories Maybe even a comic book

YOUNG HOOVER

I would only want the truth to be
told Nothing colorful Just who we

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AG’S LIBRARY - DAY

The three pieces of the LINDBERGH LADDER are carefully
brought into the temporary lab in the AG’s old library

Edgar has his eye on the strangely dressed introverted man
who seems to be organizing things ARTHUR KOEHLER

YOUNG TOULSON
He claims to be the world expert on
wood analysis

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s easy to be the expert if
youre the only one in the world
with any interest

YOUNG TOULSON
He claims he can tell as much from
a wood cut as a doctor can from an
autopsy He has some social
difficulties--

YOUNG HOOVER
Is he mentally ill

YOUNG TOULSON
Only as mad as you are sir

The Attorney General storms across the hall toward Edgar

ATTORNEY GENERAL
This was supposed to be a
“temporary inconvenience” Mr
Hoover If you want your Sherlock
Holmes playtime I suggest--

YOUNG HOOVER
Where do you suggest I go

ATTORNEY GENERAL
I suggest you take your case to
congress and put my books back

YOUNG HOOVER

(turning red)
Would you like me to tell the
country we cannot solve the
Lindbergh case because we can’t
afford a proper labratory and the
Attorney General won’t even let us
use his library

ATTORNEY GENERAL
Fine Now Get your science fair
project out of here

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY

need chemists tracing their efforts
We must have the most advanced force
in the world if we are to have the
safest nation on earth

SENATOR
But Mr Hoover yours is already
one of the most well funded
departments in Washington

YOUNG HOOVER
That is true sir but our car and
bank robbery recoveries totaled 65
million last year and our budget
was only 2 million Unlike other
departments in Washington we run a
profit And you cannot possibly
quantify the value of our successes

SENATOR MCKELLER takes the mic He’s not half as friendly

SENATOR MCKELLER
Mr Hoover is it true that you
directly or indirectly spend the
Bureau’s money on advertising

YOUNG HOOVER
We are not permitted in any way to
engage in advertising sir

SENATOR MCKELLER
But you take part for instance in
the making of radio shows and comic
books I’ve seen several of these
G-men” programs and your picture
seems to be shown in conjunction
with them quite frequently

YOUNG HOOVER
(very uncomfortable)
We declined emphatically to lend
any form of endorsement and had
nothing to do with their
production furnished no advice
technical advice or other advice

Clyde leans back and tries not to look shocked -- this was
blatant lie For the first time Edgar starts to sweat

SENATOR MCKELLER
The very advertisement said the
broadcasts were “True reflection
as contained in the OFFICIAL
RECORDS Based on actual cases
from the files of Federal Bureau of
Investigation Saturday nights at 8
oclock”

(Edgar is speechless)

Mr Hoover what are your exact
qualifications for your leadership
position with this Bureau

YOUNG HOOVER
(his job now at risk)
19 years with the Department of
Justice 12 as Director

SENATOR MCKELLER
And in that time have you EVER
made an arrest yourself

YOUNG HOOVER
I have made investigations I
administer many cases at once Sir

SENATOR MCKELLER
That’s not what I asked The comics
show you with a machine gun making
arrests Is that just fiction

YOUNG HOOVER
I am responsible for thousands of
arrests sir

SENATOR MCKELLER
So you admit it’s PURE fiction In
fact it wasn’t you who hunted and
captured John Dilinger at all It
was Agent Purvis is that correct

YOUNG HOOVER
I have been in charge of all of
these cases but no sir I have
not personally made an arrest

Edgar’s blood is boiling humiliated
EXT THE CAPITOL - LATER
Edgar marches out rambling at Clyde at a frantic pace

YOUNG HOOVER
We spend our lives working for
justice and the thanks we get is a
political attack Would they rather
crimes go unsolved Why is he
fighting me Start a file on
Senator McKeller immediately I
want three agents on him at all
times Go through his trash
Photograph him at every dinner

Edgar arrives at his armored car and gets in Clyde follows

YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
Get out You can walk back

YOUNG TOULSON
We have lunch We don’t miss
lunches No matter what Remember

YOUNG HOOVER
You pulled away from me in there

YOUNG TOULSON
I’m sorry Edgar but it was a lie
An easily provable one If he had
pursued it there’s no telling how
much worse it could have been

YOUNG HOOVER
(a beat then)
Find out where Agent Purvis is He
is to be demoted immediately or
better yet fired

YOUNG TOULSON
Firing the man who killed Dilinger
would be a PR disaster

YOUNG HOOVER
Then he’ll spend the rest of his
career behind a desk And tell him
if he wants to keep that job he’d
best keep out of the papers

Edgar shuts the door leaving Clyde on the sidewalk The car
drives off The “lunch promise” is already broken but it’s
not the punishment Clyde took it as -- Edgar is breaking
down He sets in on a panic attack

Edgar rushes across the street from his hiding place his
heart pounding Clyde a step behind Karpis shuts his door

INT HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE — DAY

Clyde walks in holding a cereal box Edgar takes it and digs
through it like a kid looking for the toy -- but without any
of the joy Edgar pulls out a toy badge It says “PURVIS”

REVEAL the front of the box has an image of Agent Melvin
Purvis with “THE FBI AGENT WHO CAUGHT DILINGER”

YOUNG HOOVER
Write the cereal maker Let them
know they must print any further
boxes to read “FORMER-AGENT” of
the FBI
(with a grin)
Sit I have something to show you

He pulls a letter from his desk stifles a giggle and reads

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
“Only eight more days funny how
even the dearest face will fade
away in time Most clearly I
remember your eyes with a kind of
teasing smile in them and the
feeling of that soft spot just
north-east of the corner of your
mouth against my lips”

Edgar almost collapses with laughter

YOUNG TOULSON
What is it

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s from Lorena Hickock the White
House reporter with the bad
breath to Mrs Roosevelt

YOUNG TOULSON
What are you going to do with it

YOUNG HOOVER
Nothing I accused her of having an
affair with a man but Old Horse
Face is having an affair with Bat
Breath A woman I was wrong

Helen Gandy sticks her head in Edgar clears the tears from
his eyes He can’t stop laughing

HELEN GANDY
Mr Hoover they’d like to see you
in the labratory

YOUNG HOOVER
I’ll be right there Miss Gandy
(she goes)
Clyde the races begin in Del Mar
next week I was thinking of taking
a quick vacation I thought perhaps
you’d like to join me

YOUNG TOULSON
(smiles considers)
I’ve never been to a horse race

YOUNG HOOVER
It’s wonderful And between you and
me when I lose my bets the track
covers the losses

YOUNG TOULSON
And when you win

YOUNG HOOVER
They pay

YOUNG TOULSON
So where’s the thrill

YOUNG HOOVER
In the sun that comes down in the
stands The hotel rooms The
service The dinners The company
Come with me

YOUNG TOULSON
I would love to

YOUNG HOOVER
I‘ll have Miss Gandy make all the
arrangements It will be perfect

YOUNG TOULSON
Edgar I’m afraid I can’t now
But perhaps in a few months if I
start saving

YOUNG HOOVER
No It’s covered Completely

YOUNG TOULSON
I really couldn’t do that

YOUNG HOOVER
You’ve done so much for me For the
Bureau Consider it a thank you
(Clyde isn’t convinced)
Ill get a suite with adjoining
rooms instead of separate rooms
That will be savings enough

YOUNG TOULSON
It’s a deal
(smiles warmly)
You should go They’re waiting for
you in the crime lab Mr Hoover

INT THE NEW FBI CRIME LABRATORY - MOMENTS LATER

Clearly Edgar got what he wanted The basement of the FBI has
been turned into a massive new crime lab Rows and rows of
files hold FINGER PRINTS Rows and rows of SCIENTIFIC
INSTRUMENTS and LAB TECHNICIANS fill the halls

Edgar walks the long hall finally arriving at an EXAMINATION
TABLE Wood specialist Koehler (earlier) has disassembled
the Lindbergh ladder each rail and rung numbered As he
explains his findings we see Edgar’s LIGHT STRINGS
connecting the evidence These two are peas in a pod

ARTHUR KOEHLER
There are several kinds of wood
here Pine Birch Fir And if you
look closely you will see that
each has its own internal markings
rings and knots and its own
external markings as in here from
the machinery that milled the raw
timber And these that mark the
tools used to build the ladder

YOUNG HOOVER
(re a long piece of wood)
This one is very different

ARTHUR KOEHLER
Yes Number 16 It was a rail And
look at these four nail holes They
were NOT used in the construction
of the ladder

YOUNG HOOVER
It was used for something else
before the ladder was built

ARTHUR KOEHLER
Yes And it’s low grade sapwood
with NO signs of weathering so it
was inside not out And the pine
shows no signs of previous use
That tells us this ladder was built
for THIS job Nothing else

YOUNG HOOVER
How does this help us identify the
kidnapper

ARTHUR KOEHLER
I need more money sir

YOUNG HOOVER
For

ARTHUR KOEHLER
Postage I need to write to every
mill on the East coast to see if
their blades match these marks

Edgar considers Is this guy for real or really nuts He
looks at the wood again and ALL THE CONNECTIONS LIGHT UP

YOUNG HOOVER
I want a report on each mill And a
map to track all leads By the time
I’m in New York I want something
to report Mr Koehler

INT “G-MEN” MOVIE PREMIERE - NIGHT

Up on the screen is the movie “G-Men” Lighting quick James
“Brick” Davis (JAMES CAGNEY) jumps through a window

JAMES CAGNEY (IN THE FILM)
Hold your fire

The machine guns go silent He grabs the gun from the
suspect’s hand and hip tosses him over a table to the floor

Cagney now plays the “G-MAN” as the hero instead of “PUBLIC
ENEMY NUMBER ONE” The G-man has officially replaced the
criminal as protagonist The audience eats it up REVEAL
Edgar next to Clyde watching with pride

EXT “G-MEN” THEATER RED CARPET - NIGHT

THE STAR The press goes mad when A LITTLE GIRL WITH CURLS
marches up and Edgar bends down to her

SHIRLEY TEMPLE
Mr Hoover I was wondering if you
would join MY police force

YOUNG HOOVER
Why yes If you agree to be an
honorary G-woman Miss Temple
and give me one little kiss

SHIRLEY TEMPLE
I don’t know if your wife would
approve Mr Hoover

The press laughs So does Edgar He shoots back

YOUNG HOOVER
But Miss Temple you see I still
live with my mother

The press eats it up It’s everything Edgar ever dreamed of
for himself and his Bureau

INT LIMOUSINE —- MOMENTS LATER
Edgar gets in back with Clyde His mother gets in the front

YOUNG TOULSON

YOUNG HOOVER

Clyde smiles As the car pulls away Edgar moves his hand on
top of Clyde’s like it’s the most natural thing in the world

INT THE STORK CLUB NYC - NIGHT
Edgar and Clyde are escorted in by the CLUB OWNER

STORK CLUB OWNER
I have you at a table with Anita
Colby Lela Rogers and her
daughter Ginger have asked if
they can join

YOUNG HOOVER
As long as it’s near the front

And he leads them through the oogling crowd in this the most
exclusive night club in the city It’s immaculate The live
music and decor make the Great Depression feel like fiction

INT THE STORK CLUB EDGAR’S TABLE UP FRONT - LATER

Edgar holds court with a handful of actresses and singers
amongst them Lela Rogers and her daughter He goes on at a
mile a minute the women reacting with giggles and awe

YOUNG HOOVER
The bullet entered the back of his
head and exited through the front
near his cheek The thing people
don’t realize is that there is very
little blood The heat of the
bullet seals the wound as it
enters So the scene is far more
peaceful than you depict in your
moving pictures

REVEAL Clyde is at a remove literally pushed away by the
women to listen from afar and deal with the WAITERS

LELA ROGERS
And little Lindy Did you see the
child with your own eyes

YOUNG HOOVER
Those aren’t details I can share
with a group of refined women I
couldn’t stand to make a single one
of you shed a tear But I assure
you we’re on the case

MODEL -- ANITA COLBY
I saw the Lindberghs in Paris I
hardly recognized them

YOUNG HOOVER
Only justice can bring reason back
to their lives but I might share
one confidential clue with you If
you will swear secrecy

He holds out his pinky They giggle hold out theirs and make
a four way pinky pact More laughter Lela doesn’t let go of
his pinky She’s falling for him He gets quiet

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
The first gold notes from the
ransom money have surfaced And can
you guess where

MODEL -- ANITA COLBY
Tell us Please Mr Hoover

YOUNG HOOVER
In the Bronx On three occasions
And each of the shop owners who
turned them in claim they received
them from a man with a pointed
chin and a German accent

Anita gasps and cozies up to Edgar Lela clocks it She wants
him to herself Clyde watches it all play out from afar

ANITA COLBY
(flirting)
Take my word for it Mr Hoover
all the admiration in the world
can’t fill the spot where love
goes or keep your bed warm

Clyde tunes in Edgar tries not to notice

YOUNG HOOVER
I serve my country Miss Colby A
nation’s admiration is more than
enough for me

ANITA COLBY
But it likely makes for a cold bed

The band strikes up “RED SAILS IN THE SUNSET” Lela sees it
as an opportunity to pull “her Edgar” away

LELA ROGERS
Mr Hoover Would it be out of the
question to bother you for a dance

YOUNG HOOVER
(suddenly panicked)
How do you mean

LELA ROGERS
Well simply a dance You do
dance don’t you

YOUNG HOOVER
(turning red)
It’s a skill I haven’t mastered
and the night is getting long

LELA ROGERS
Then no time like the present This
is my favorite song

YOUNG HOOVER

(turning purple)
Mr Toulson I think it’s t-t-time
for us to go We have a good deal
of work t-t-tomorrow I’m afraid I
just don’t have t--t--time to
dance My sincere apology N-- Now
Mr Toulson This minute

And Edgar finally wiggles his way out of the table clearly
running away from the women Clyde follows

Lela and Ginger can’t contain their laughter Edgar catches a
glimpse of it on his way out He’s humiliated

INT WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL MOTHER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

On his mother’s bed is a now giant album of Edgar’s press
clippings with a new shot of Edgar from the premiere’s press
book Edgar is crying and stuttering at her beside

YOUNG HOOVER
I--I--I d--d--d-don’t like to d-d--
d--d-dance a-a--

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Edgar go look in the mirror and
talk the way the doctor taught you
to Be my little Speedie

He stands up looks in the mirror straightens his posture
and starts talking in his fast “speedie” way the way the
world knows him -- it’s his stutter cure

YOUNG HOOVER

Yes mother I can spit my words
out with precision diction and
clarity I don’t like to dance I
don’t like to dance with anyone
but mostly I don’t like to dance
with women mother It’s about time
you knew I find it humiliating and
I refuse to be publicly humiliated

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Edgar Stop
(he does)
Do you remember Barton Pincus

YOUNG HOOVER
(speedy in the mirror)
His father was the watchmaker He
(MORE)

YOUNG HOOVER (CONTD)
was 10 years younger than me and
you called him “Birdie” or “Daffy”

EDGAR’S MOTHER
Do you remember what happened to
“Daffy” after the school custodian
discovered him in the hoop skirt
and the flower bonnet

YOUNG HOOVER
He was made to stand outside our
school wearing the skirt and bonnet
as punishment

EDGAR’S MOTHER
And did you ever wonder why we
called him Daffy

YOUNG HOOVER
For his odd behavior

EDGAR’S MOTHER
It was short for daffodil Edgar
And do you remember what happened
to little Daffodile Pincus

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes He shot himself six weeks
after he stood outside school in
that skirt

EDGAR’S MOTHER
That’s right And I thank God every
day that my own sons don’t suffer
from his condition Edgar I’d
rather have a dead son than a
daffodil for a son

She closes Edgar’s album and wills herself out of bed

EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now I’ll to teach you how to dance

YOUNG HOOVER
Yes mother

Edgar cannot even face her He can only look at her through
the mirror It’s a heartbreaking moment

newfound passion for “traditional morality”

might pull a rifle on that hat

Edgar imitates how it must have bounced each time she took a

There is glass everywhere Edgar is speechless

Stop this

Clyde gets up in Edgars face It looks like he might fight
him physically

YOUNG TOULSON
You will never tell me what to do

see through you You’re a scared
heartless horrible little man

Edgar throws a punch It lands Toulson throws one of his
own It’s a brutal fight Years of pent up attraction

They crash to the floor Clyde pins Edgar He considers
pounding his face in Instead he kisses Edgar full on the
lips They hold for a moment Edgar hardly resists Finally
Clyde pulls away

YOUNG HOOVER
(not meaning it)
Don’t ever do that again

YOUNG TOULSON
I wont

Clyde checks himself for cuts and starts out of the room
He’s almost to his bedroom when Edgar stops him

(Clyde can’t answer)
Get a doctor

INT DC HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM - DAY
Flanked by TWO AGENTS and Miss Gandy Hoover looks quite ill

DOCTOR
He should be able to recover most
of his function but a stroke like
this will limit the hours he can
work The information he can
process For a while at least
Are you okay Mr Hoover

OLD HOOVER
I played in the yard with my dog on
Saturday Perhaps it’s dehydration

DOCTOR
That could do it But it may be
wise to reduce your work hours as
well At your age it’s important to
take leave

OLD HOOVER
Can I have some privacy please

The other Agents go Hoover steams

OLD HOOVER (CONTD)
If you ever denigrate me in front

railroaded out of your profession

I apologize sir

What do you have for energy

DOCTOR
We have diet medications that tend
to give a boost

OLD HOOVER
So I could lose a few pounds and
have more energy

You don’t need to worry about your
weight sir it’s solid weight

It’s ass kissing but Hoover appreciates it

OLD HOOVER
They’re giving him the Nobel Prize
(Toulson nods)
The degenerates and radicals are
being lifted up internationally
It’s like 1920 all over again

OLD TOULSON
Dont

OLD HOOVER
When he finds out we have this
tape that we know the truth about
his character he will decline the
award

OLD TOULSON
Johnson Wait

He ignores Toulson’s plea focusing instead on Toulson’s egg
struggle He gets up leans in close and peels it for him

OLD HOOVER

I can’t understand you Clyde You
have to work harder to enunciate

(Toulson looks concerned)
We have no legal recourse Law
enforcement hasnt kept pace with
the improved tactics of today’s
criminals

OLD TOULSON
What’s the idea

OLD HOOVER
We have friends in the press We
plant stories with them to insure
the activities of suspected radical
leaders see the light of day

OLD TOULSON
They’1l trace it

OLD HOOVER
Only if they’re true It’s Counter
intelligence Clyde The more
untrue the story the more dramatic
the impact I’m going to deliver
the hotel recording the day before
the Nobel Prize with a personal
letter If he still accepts it
I‘ll deliver the tape to the press

OLD TOULSON
The tape may not be legal

OLD HOOVER
That’s why the letter won’t be from
me It will be a fictitious letter
from one of his own

OLD TOULSON
There would be no room for
error I’m not certain we could
insure that

Hoover doesn’t like the prudent advice or his “special
friend’s” flagrant display of mortality

OLD HOOVER
I can’t understand you Clyde

Hoover hits his own yolk It’s hard He tosses it down to his
dog who’s been waiting expectantly

I need you back at the office
tomorrow It’s no time to relent

I can’t

It’s not the answer Hoover wanted

about the mysterious recipient

Hoover is with a new writer AGENT JONES He almost looks
black -- mixed race perhaps Hoover is trying to process it

AGENT JONES
Miss Gandy told me you stopped with

INT BRUNO HAUPTMANS HOME - DAY
Hauptmann is handcuffed standing in the middle of the room
His wife walks in Edgar’s focus shifts from a pricey

her from embracing her husband She starts to cry Hauptmann
tries to comfort her -- in German

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
Es ist nichts Es ist Uber meine

YOUNG HOOVER
What did he say

OFFICER ONE
That this is about his gambling

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
May I sit

He knows he’s been caught in a lie He sits by the window

YOUNG HOOVER
Where’s the rest of his money

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
I don’t know what you mean Or who
HE is

YOUNG HOOVER
You don’t know who Charles
Lindbergh is

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
Except maybe from the papers no

YOUNG HOOVER
This isn’t the kind of money a
carpenter makes Mr Hauptmann

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
I made Wall Street investments

Agents in the adjoining room start ripping open Hauptman’s
mattress but Hauptmann pays it no attention He simply gazes
out the window Edgar takes note He walks to the window
peers out and sees the small crude garage fifty feet away

INT BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S GARAGE —- LATER

Agents tear up the floorboards in the garage They find fresh
dirt grab a shovel and dig into it and quickly find a jar
buried in a hole but it is only filled with water

INT BRUNO HAUPTMANS HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Edgar stands in front of Hauptmann holding the empty jar

YOUNG HOOVER
Where is the ransom money Bruno
Did you spend it all on your old
lady’s shoe collection

His wife Anna’s shoes are in a pile in the middle of the
floor She’s having a nervous breakdown

Agents start carting out stacks of Hauptman’s papers filled
with his handwriting

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
Where are you taking my things

YOUNG HOOVER
To the FBI Mr Hauptmann Does
that worry you

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
You hunt the wrong man because I

Albert Osborne is isolated on a riser with 11x14 photostat
blow ups of letters and words from Hauptman’s writings

ALBERT S OSBORNE
In both the ransom note and Mr
Hauptmann’s personal writings he
wrote “haus” for house “anyding”
for anything”“gut” for good” and
“boad” for boat And notice the
inverted capital N”s and “y”s that
look like js

You’re right Agent Jones Alone it
wouldn’t have been enough So when
my agents arrived to replace the
local police we searched again

INT BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S GARAGE - DAY
FBI AGENTS are literally dismantling the garage EDGAR IS
STANDING WATCH The NYC Police simply observe Edgar is
focused on a piece of wood he finds odd It’s above the work-
bench -- a board nailed across two joists

YOUNG HOOVER
What purpose would a piece of wood
like this serve
REVEAL wood expert Koehler is now there too

ARTHUR KOEHLER
It doesn’t appear structural

JUMP TO AGENTS carefully pull the board off the joists
waiting to see if anything gives structurally It doesn’t
Behind it they finds TWO NEWSPAPER PACKETS Edgar opens one
carefully Inside are ONE HUNDRED TEN-DOLLAR GOLD NOTES

YOUNG HOOVER
Remove all the joists

JUMP TO ANOTHER AGENT finds a hidden shelf In it is a ONE
GALLON SHELLAC CAN He pulls out the rags stuffed on top
Inside is 11930 worth of ransom money

AT THE SAME TIME Arthur Koehler finds Hauptman’s tool chest
He opens it It’s neat and organized All of the tools are in
place except the STANDARD 34 INCH CHISEL He pulls
Hauptman’s saw from the chest and examines it

INT A NEO-COLONIAL BUILDING LIMBO - DAY

The same space the handwriting expert appeared in earlier --
now Arthur Koehler is explaining his own findings

ARTHUR KOEHLER
You see no two saws make the same
markings This saw from Bruno
Hauptmann’s tool chest makes
markings identical to those found
on the ladder used in the crime I
searched 1900--

(holds up a piece of wood)
--factories across the country to
see which blade made the other cuts
on the ladder I narrowed it down
to one Centralia lumber yard Four
blocks from Mr Hauptman’s home

CLOSE ON Edgar listens from a bench seemingly alone giddy
with this man’s scientific exactitude

INT BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S ATTIC - NIGHT

Edgar is with Agent Sisk and Arthur Koehler as they approach
an attic corner and see -- an eight foot board is missing

Koehler unwraps a long bag labeled -- “Rail 16” It’s the
original rail he pointed out to Edgar in the lab so long ago

ARTHUR KOEHLER (VO)
Rail 16 It didn’t match the rest
And those extra holes Why were
they there

He lays the wood next to the empty spot in the floor It’s a
perfect match The four extra holes match perfectly with the
nail holes in the floor joists

INT A NEO-COLONIAL BUILDING - DAY
Arthur is still in the white space

ARTHUR KOEHLER
The science is conclusive Mr
Hauptmann built the ladder

In a gray suit and shirt with a tie Charles Lindbergh walks
slowly and confidently up to the stand and takes the seat
next to THE JUDGE The room is hushed

Lindbergh looks through the crowd to the defense stand
stopping on Anna Hauptmann He remains calm unreadable

WILENTZ (CONT’D)
Picking up where you left off You
said you heard a voice in the
cemetary that night

CHARLES LINDBERGH
Yes Very clearly A voice coming
from the cemetary to the best of
my belief calling Dr Condon In a
foreign accent “Hey Doctor”

WILENTZ
And since that time have you heard
the same voice

CHARLES LINDBERGH
Yes I have

WILENTZ
And whose voice was it Colonel
that you heard in the vicinity of
St Raymond’s Cemetery that night
saying “Hey Doctor”

And for the first time Lindbergh turns his gaze from Wilentz-
-- to Bruno Hauptmann Emotionless Strong

That was Hauptman’s voice

Hauptmann locks eyes with Lindbergh They hold their gazes
for a moment The air goes out of the room Lindbergh looks
back to Wilentz and A GASP RUNS THROUGH THE ROOM

truth Have you told the truth

I told the truth already

WILENTZ
And the statements you made to
District Attorney Foley did you
tell him the whole truth

To a certain extent

And to a certain extent you didnt
tell him the truth is that it

It looks like 2974 and the numbers
down here 3-7154 is that right

BRUNO HAUPTMAN
Yes

WILENTZ
And between those numbers are some
words it looks like Decatur and
Sedgwick you see that You know
what that means dont you that

It is Dr Condons address and
telephone number The man who paid
the ransom Written in your writing

You dont usually do things without

He’s deliberately allowed himself
to be surrounded by Communists
With the power he’s gathered he’s
now the greatest domestic threat-—-

Edgar turns up the volume He focuses in on a chiron
“SWEDEN - NOBEL PEACE PRIZE”

OLD HOOVER (CONTD)
He’ll decline the award He knows
what we have could ruin him There
is no question He’s done Clyde

Hoover stops breathing He can’t hear the reporter He’s now
focused on the grainy BandW image of MARTIN LUTHER KING being
handed the Nobel Peace Prize And then his words

MARTIN LUTHER KING

(on TV)
I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace
at a moment when 22 million Negroes
of the United States of America are
engaged in a creative battle to end
the long night of racial injustice

(a jump cut)
--all the people of the world will
have to discover a way to live
together in peace man must evolve
a method which rejects revenge
aggression and retaliation

(a jump cut)
I believe that unarmed truth and
unconditional love will have the
final word in reality This is why
right temporarily defeated is
stronger than evil triumphant I
believe that what self-centered men
have torn down men other-centered
can build up

It’s now clear that the man Hoover’s been after this whole
time is King It’s also clear Hoover’s lost this round He
shuts off the TV Shamed

But did he act alone Is he the one
who actually took the child from
the crib How can you be sure

The mountain of evidence we
discovered uncovered clarified and
confirmed You can’t dispute it

Clarence Darrow did

OLD HOOVER
Of course That’s what he does

AGENT JONES
And Mrs Roosevelt issued a public
statement questioning his guilt

OLD HOOVER
Mr Jones She has plenty to hide
herself when it comes to un-
American activities

OLD HOOVER
The public would be And they
deserve to know the truth

BEN BRADLEE
The public might be curious But
with all due respect I’m not sure
it’s of serious interest

The SCLC has direct ties to
communism Mr Bradlee We are
seeing a pervasive contempt for law
and order The crime rate it
soaring there is widespread open
defiance of authority and mark my
words if this goes unchecked it
will once again plunge our Nation
into the abyss of anarchy

BEN BRADLEE
Ive found no connection between
Mr King and the Communist party

not careful And it spreads and it
corrupts the soul turning the

able to live with yourself knowing
you could have prevented the
bombings and violence

I appreciate you bringing this to
me Edgar I’1ll consider it

OLD HOOVER
(pleased)
I can tell you are interested Ben

BEN BRADLEE
Yes I am But I’1l be candid
Edgar I’m more interested in what
this says about you and your FBI

OLD HOOVER
If you’re going to be candid Ben
Be candid

BEN BRADLEE
You know the funny thing about
notoriety Especially the kind that
needs adoration fame for fame’s
sake If unchecked it inevitably
leads to villainy infamy

OLD HOOVER
Exactly And I’ve worked too hard
to watch the bad guys capture the
spotlight again

With all due respect sir I
suggest you look into what this
squabble with Mr King is really
about before you destroy the

know you love the most

out of his mind He walks to the window Outside there is a

He looks down just in time to see the presidential motorcade
It’s the inauguration of Richard Nixon

He looks out to the mall in the distance He can see an ocean
of anti-war protestors This isn’t the country he’s known --

He asked what I had in the files on

OLD TOULSON
What did you say

OLD HOOVER
What file sir” But he knows He
asked me to expand our wiretaps to
cover news reporters

OLD TOULSON
We can’t do that Especially now

That’s the problem Clyde If I
won’t do his “Black Bag” jobs
he’ll create his own private force

OLD TOULSON
That’s illegal

He didn’t say it I could see it in
his eyes He won’t be controlled
He’ll do anything to hold onto
power He’s a menace

I NEVER played his game If to some
it seemed like rule bending then
perhaps they need to look into

Sisk did You weren’t even at the
scene Just the photo-op
INT TOULSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

In atypical fashion Hoover is silent He knows it’s true

OLD TOULSON

Most of what you wrote was
exaggeration The rest lies and I
don’t know if you even realize it
anymore

(Hoover looks ill)
Edgar You can lie to everyone
else The whole world For your own
sake for the sake of the Bureau
But you CANNOT lie to me

Hoover is sweating Toulson hands him a handkerchief

OLD HOOVER
I should never have given you a
job You know that Clyde You
weren’t qualified
(Toulson readies for an attack)
Do you remember what you did in
your interview

OLD TOULSON
I don’t

OLD HOOVER
You fixed my window And you
found my handkerchief on the floor
And you handed it to me Do you
know why I was sweating

OLD TOULSON
Because you were exercising

And Hoover dabs his forehead with Toulson’s handkerchief
Toulson doesn’t interrupt he refolds the handkerchief

OLD HOOVER
No That was also a lie I was
sweating because I knew that I
needed you I’ve never needed
anyone else in my entire life Not
like that And I started to
perspire

OLD TOULSON
(a long beat then)
I know

Hoover puts a hand on his chest likely feigning indigestion -
- perhaps wanting a way out of this affectionate moment

OLD TOULSON (CONT’D)
Are you okay

OLD HOOVER
Yes Indigestion Would you like
to have dinner tomorrow night At
our old place

OLD TOULSON
(he knows he can’t)
Perhaps if I feel better

OLD HOOVER
Then you must We have a good many
things to discuss I can’t depend
on anyone at the Bureau now

And in his boldest show of affection in the film Hoover
kisses Toulson’s forehead holding his lips there for some
time Toulson grabs his arm

OLD TOULSON
Thank you Edgar

And Hoover goes trying to remain “J Edgar Hoover” despite
the feelings rising up inside him

INT HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME —- THAT NIGHT

Hoover walks into his home Something seems off but he can’t
figure it out

He plays with HIS DOGS They lead him to a portrait of his
Mom It seems she is making eye contact with him He
considers taking her down but instead straightens her Now
all is right

INT THE OVAL OFFICE — MORNING

Richard Nixon is with his Chief of staff HR HALDEMAN He’s
just gotten a piece of juicy news He’s stunned

RICHARD NIXON
Jesus Christ That old cocksucker

HR HALDEMAN
Ill get a speech prepared We
should go on Television

RICHARD NIXON
Not yet First seal off his office
Change the locks Do whatever you
have to I want those fucking
files

INT HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE - MORNING

Helen shows up to work as usual Cool as Ice Her phone
rings She takes the call in stride and makes a simple note
in her ledger -- CALL HOOVER HOUSEKEEPER ANNIE” She
walks back to her office door and closes it

INT HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME — MORNING

Old Toulson struggles up the stairs behind A MAID When they
reach Hoover’s bedroom door she stops She’s not going in

Toulson takes a beat considers the door He’s never been in
the room He pushes it open REVEAL it’s filled with Ming
vases porcelain Foo dogs Buddhas ivory elephants AND A
MULTITUDE OF NUDE MALE STATUES displayed on mahogany tables
draped in lace This is Hoover’s hidden world Any light that
might try and get in is blocked by Chinese screens

And there lying on the floor in his silk pajama bottoms is
the body of J Edgar Hoover Toulson kneels next to the body
and lovingly closes his eyes Hoover has passed

INT HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Toulson finds a stack of files sitting on the bedside table
On top is the manuscript of his unfinished book He picks it
up Under it is the King’s sex tape transcript and a folder
labeled “Eleanor Roosevelt” He opens it and pulls out a
photostat of a letter As he reads it we hear a replay of
Young Edgar reading it years ago

YOUNG HOOVER (VO)
“Funny how even the dearest face
will fade away in time Most
clearly I remember your eyes with
a kind of teasing smile in them
and the feeling of that soft spot
just northeast of the corner of
your mouth against my lips”

It’s the lesbian love letter to Eleanor that Edgar once
rolled with laughter at It seems he liked to keep it close
and read it often
INT THE OVAL OFFICE - INTERCUT
Broadcast of the President

RICHARD NIXON (VO)

It can truly be said of him that he
was a legend in his own time--

INT HOOVER’S OUTER AND INNER OFFICES - SAME TIME

NIXON’S MEN barge into Hoover’s old office seal it off and
search for his secret files They stand guard at the door
not letting anyone in or out

RICHARD NIXON (VO)
--His magnificent contribution to
making this a great and good nation
will be remembered by the American
people long after the petty
carpings and vicious criticisms of
his detractors are forgotten

INT HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

It’s too late Helen already has her boss’s private filing
cabinets safely in her office And as the President’s men
search Hoover’s office and change his locks she quietly dips
the last of his files into the shredder

RICHARD NIXON (VO)
The FBI he literally created and
built is today universally regarded
as the finest law-enforcement
agency in the world

INT HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME BEDROOM - DAY

Toulson lays down in Hoover’s untouched bed holding the old
Eleanor Roosevelt letter close to his chest

RICHARD NIXON
The FBI is the eternal monument
honoring this great American
FADE OUT
TITLE CARDS ON BLACK
The contents of Hoover’s “private and personal” files will
never be known Only a few clues from misfiled items have

ever surfaced

Clyde Toulson inherited Hoover’s estate moved into his
house and accepted the US flag draped over his coffin

Clyde Toulsons grave is a few yards from Hoovers in the
Congressional Cemetery
