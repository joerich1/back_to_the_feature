his voice before answering

Matt was so suddenly emotionally extended that the
anger

leaves him that quickly just a strange atypical
lightning

bolt of rage toward life and women

(again into phone)
You know what Im being a sort of
gutless wonder here Im yelling
back at you because Im embarrassed
I wont be able to take the kid when
I said Why dont you listen for a

holding

the phone This allows us to hear his ex-wife repeat
the

same sentence over and over again

MCALPINE
Good to see you
He speaks with an Australian accent gets half-up and
extends

his hand

MARTIN
and Burke Adler the producer

BURKE
So what have you been doing with
yourself
(checking resume)
the last few years

MATT
(to Burke)
Im real bad at interviews so if
you dont mind Id really prefer to
just read first

BURKE
Thats the way you want to do it

MATT
Yes

BURKE
Maybe we shouldnt even read Ill
just take your word that youre good

Matt smiles

BURKE
No Im serious Theres all different
ways Did you know Woody Allen never
reads actors He just looks at them
feels around a little and then decides
who he wants Thats his way Doesnt
hear them do a line I also have a
way What I do is interview first--
then read--maybe do it all over again
the next day I call up people the
actor has worked with--check him

out If hes famous I do an opinion
survey to test how much people like
him If hes not famous I put him

on tape and show it to everyone I

can grab I believe in screen tests
I believe in replacing if the dailies
are bad in cutting people out if

the previews arent there Because
Im not doing movies for theaters
where they serve cappucino in the
lobby Im doing popcorn movies You
want to know what I like Come to my
house look at my lamps you wont
find it in my movies In my movies
youll find out what I know I know
how to do detail What I dont know
I discover Yesterday we finished
mixing a movie--the last scene is in
a field of windmills which blows up
and all the blades of these windmills
slice through the air one of which
hits a four-story tank of propane
gas A humongous explosion scene I
kept on saying louder and they
finally said to me they couldnt go
louder without distortion We went
louder We had to discover a thing

a filter but we went louder I dont
question doing these things I do
them So if you want to know if its
okay to do it differently--not to

talk--to just read first I say
(pointing to John
Earl)

Ask him--hes the director

JOHN EARL
Whatever

BURKE
Okay lets do it Do you have any
questions
MATT
They only gave me these two pages
Id like to give this my best shot
So if I could read the script and
come back

BURKE
This part works tomorrow

Oh Who will I be reading with

Burke indicates Martin

MATT

I want you to do it wherever youre

note to the director

ANGLE ON REAR OF HOUSE

Where Burke spies the STUDIO HEAD and leaves Matts

ON STUDIO HEAD
As BURKE enters the frame behind him He is right

boss ear He leans in and offers an intimacy
BURKE
Im glad you came yourself instead
of sending your staff

The boss is startled--jumps BURKE eyes him there
must be
some way to profit from these stolen moments with a
powerful
man
BURKE
I wouldnt be surprised if tonights
screening is a monster
(emphatically)
Could happen right
STUDIO HEAD
Sure
BURKE
Okay
He moves back to Matt and Nan at the rear of the
audience
BURKE
(to Matt)
Eisner just said he thinks the
screening will be a monster
Strangely Burke seems truly buoyed by the words of
encouragement he himself manufactured He moves down
three
rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens
with a
series of violent explosions
CLOSE ON NAN
NAN
Please God let tonight give him
peace
Incredibly Burke turns and gestures to her that the
sound
of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of
his
movie Nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she
whispers

to Matt

NAN
Were short two card-counters can
you two help out

INT MOVIE THEATER - 14720 LATER

INT WHOLESALE BUTCHERS (THE FILM) - DAY

As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the

giant

refrigerated meat door He passes cows and dead men
hanging

from alternate hooks Suddenly he is attacked by the
villain

brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool The
hero

ducks the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh The
hero

grabs the only weapon he can find a large piece of
meat on

a large bone which he uses as a mace He clubs the
other

man--then again--and again Part of the audience is
whooping

and applauding

QUICK SHOT OF NAN

As she secretly reaches for and holds Burkes hand Is
sympathy or congratulations

TIGHT ON STUDIO EXECUTIVE FACES

As we see in ever-so-SLOWED ACTIONS tense lips turning
gloriously upward to reveal gums--then a smile More

EXT THEATER - NIGHT

Cathy and Matt are leaning against Burkes car

distraught--temporarily but horribly unsure of

Matt is looking at her If he had a little more

going for him right now he would make his move

now

CATHY
I never thought it would do this
well There were so many holes I
told everybody it wasnt going to do
business Why am I so public with my
opinions

MATT
You might be right

CATHY
Not with that score You know maybe
tonights the night Im losing my
entire mind but werent you in
Platoon

MATT
Incredible I was only there for a
minute in the rape scene moving
past Charlie Sheen when I left the
hut I had a great scene cut out
I was

CATHY
But there was that one long close up--
where you seemed ashamed of yourself
but still arrogant

MATT
Thats exactly what I was going for

CATHY
It reminded me of my last boyfriend

instinctively using this victory to

Cathy

But

they are two self-doubters on different trips
(indicating book bag)
Got to go

She hefts the bag--puts it back down--crosses her eyes
burlesquing the weight of the bag He helps her put it

on
her shoulder
MATT
You have to read all that
CATHY
Beast of burden
MATT
(sincerely)
So what are you totally wonderful
or what
She smiles and is gone staggering a bit under the
weight of
her scripts Matt looks after her Burke and Nan
approach

BURKE
How come you havent said anything
This is great right

NAN
No

BURKE
What no

NAN

The definite recommends are way off
for a score this high and even for
action-adventure its just too low
for women

(Burke looks anguished)
Im sorry

He leans against the car for support

BURKE
It was such a good score

NAN
(extraordinarily
sympathetic)
I know And unfortunately
yesterdays tracking wasnt
(he reacts)
Im sorry They just dont seem in
the mood for action-adventure right

(he reacts)
Sorry May I tell you one more
thing

(he looks up in

anticipatory fear)
I think its so wonderful that you
dont worry about even trying to act
strong

BURKE
Thanks You want to eat something
sometime

NAN
Im uh Im blushing from head to
foot

BURKE

Good Ill call you

As Burke moves to his car He SEES the Group Captain
paying
Matt

GROUP CAPTAIN
Thirty-two thirty-three

Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise

BURKE
You want to do this regularly for
me I was gonna offer but I thought
it would humiliate you

MATT
(straight at him)
I dont mind an occasional odd job
But I cant work tomorrow I have to
get my kid

As they get in the car Burke has the front door open
about
to get in--reconsiders and gets in the rear door

BURKE
Okay I got the cards to look at--I

Matt gets behind the wheel thereby ending the day as a
fledged chauffeur They drive off

INT TRACKING ROOM - DAY
The enter the room containing a maze of telephone

NAN
Nobody ever wants to see how we do
the polling but theyre like little
starved puppies when the data comes
in--running at you scrambling to

Burke hardly hears He is awed as if by a cathedral

VARIOUS WORKERS
1) How often do you go to the movies
2) Im going to describe a movie in
one sentence and then ask you to
rate it on a scale of

BURKE
(as the workers
continue)
I love this This is what counts and
this is where you count it

NAN
(soft and true)
Thats the same way I feel

BURKE
You phone all over--you know what
movies theyre waiting to see whether
your TV spots are working You know
what the country thinks

WORKER

Cher as a singer an actress or
potential date

BURKE
(again)

Within six-point-eight percent

BURKE
And you cant fix it right
NAN
No no Sometimes just for myself

I cant resist asking America a
personal question

BURKE
Like

NAN
(simply)
When do you feel more worthless--
mornings or afternoons

BURKE
I gotta get back

They pause by a workers to say goodbye

unusual about me

BURKE

NAN
Well maybe not urgent but
immediately significant and necessary
to tell

NAN
So long

He exits as the telephone pollster continues with the

list

of prospective Michelle Pfeiffer male co-stars

Shaking her head with a disapproval which will never
die

She turns and starts for the other room

MATT
What did she do

BETH
(turning)
I loved helped and supported in
every possible way a business man
who committed the terrible crime of
being financially imaginative with a
pension fund

She exits He sits down stunned in the headlights of

his

fate

INT APARTMENT - DAY

Matt and the Marshal in the foreground as Beth talks to

Jeannie in the background We see only glimpses of

Beths face as she leans towards Jeannie from one side
of

the doorway--just Jeannies legs dangling on the other
side

BETHS VOICE
Okay listen carefully Jeannie Be
still Now whats the most important
thing in life to know

JEANNIE
No one will ever love me as much as
you do

Matt and the Marshal exchange a look of mutual horror

BETH
Good Now concentrate with all your
muscles and remember everything Im
about to say to you

The Marshal and Matt shift uncomfortably
BETH
Dont talk to strangers They may be
killers Take your vitamins so the
poison in the food cant hurt you
What else now

JEANNIES VOICE
Teeth

BETHS VOICE
Right Thank you Brush right after
you eat or your gums will start to
bleed in your sleep and choke you

The Marshal and Matt can stand no more--they each call

MATT
I thought youd read them to her

BETH
(realizing)
Oh

MARSHAL
Im not faulting you You love your
daughter and this is a very tough
thing to go through You feel guilty
and caring and it all gets mixed up
so that theres so much important
stuff going down that theres no
sure way of dealing with it but the
best thing you can do is just make
sure you love her

BETH
Typical cop talk
(on his look)
But I understand what youre trying
to say Thank you Can I have another
minute with her
She returns to the doorway which still only provides us
glimpses as she SINGS DONT TALK TO STRANGERS The
MOVES down the hallway to INTRODUCE JEANNIE trying to

things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of
suitcases

INT SITTING ROOM - DAY

As the two females who bear his name approach Matt

silence with chatter Unfortunately he can only think
one word

MATT
Hi hi hi hi hi hi

(turning to Matt)
Beginning now you must give less
value to your own happiness and well-
being then hopefully you will reach
the point where you give that no
value whatsoever Give her everything
Theres no such thing as spoiling a
child

MAN
Even if you have to steal to do it

BETH

You dont really want to mess with

from inside their apartment Then the door opens and

door and knocks (NOTE Jeannie is dressed in layers of
clothing--some of the layers play clothes some fit for
coronation She is a pocket contemporary Annie Hall

happy
smile of the just saved plastered on his face

Your little boy fell so hes
screaming And you want her to stay

Lucy confused by his buoyant reaction nods

LUCY
Okay Seven dollars an hour

Just a second
(finishes counting)

The Group Captain notes the figure on a sheet walks to

doorway and hands it to Nan who is still deep into
conversation with Matt She begins walking back to the

without looking at the sheet in her hand

NAN
I felt terrible about the way I blew
up at you when I first met you
(before he can object)
Please
FULL SHOT - THEATER AREA - NIGHT

Burke and others waiting as Matt and Nan come to a stop
some
distance away

BURKE
What are they doing

NAN
I began taking anti-depressants when
we moved here from Washington I had
some small reactions--sleeping 14
hours no libido I gained 17 pounds
in nine days--that sort of thing So
they gave me pills to deal with the
side effects And then pills to deal
with the side effects I was getting
from those pills All this besides
the stuff the nutritionist was giving
me The combination formed some sort
of potion so that I keep telling the
truth I dont have a choice Thats
why I was so rude to you

MATT
Your doctor says this

NAN
Oh yes Hes excited but only
because he sees glory for himself in
it See ordinarily I wouldnt say
that about my doctor but I cant
help it its the truth Hes
monitoring me for a while longer
before writing it up for this medical
journal

Cathy has joined them

CATHY
Burkes going crazy waiting for the
score
NAN
Coming
CATHY
(to Matt)

How are you anyway
Matt shifts figuring out his answer

CATHY
(a small laugh)
Its a tough one huh Me too
Nan looks down at the score
NAN
Oh my Matt Id better drive him
myself
She starts for Burke

ON BURKE AND OTHERS

As Nan arrives and hands the Studio Executives the

score
Burke looking over their shoulders
BURKE

FEMALE STUDIO EXEC

She kisses his cheek and leaves A beat of silence
Burke

turns to Nan

BURKE

something of

Matt
another
the

Giant

a valuable observation to offer at this dark moment

NAN
Yes I can
BURKE

NAN

Its only a movie
As Burke looks at her from the depths of his pain and
her confidently believing that she has imparted
value the movies marquee lights go off giving us a

INT MATTS HALLWAY - NIGHT

As he carries an enormously resistant Jeannie wearing
borrowed T-shirt nightie back towards his apartment
has Jeannie under one arm--her clothes and shoes in
Jeannies arms are extended towards Lucy who stands in
open doorway of her apartment She begins thrashing

tears come--the moment is operatic

JEANNIE
Let go Please Lucy dont make me
go

MATT
Everyones tired You can come back
tomorr

LUCY

Listen to me Jeannie

JEANNIE
I want to live here with these people
God let me live here

MATT
Maybe if she stayed tonight she

and

JEANNIE
I love it here so much that

Now her fathers last words have registered on her--she
immediately stops crying though tears still roll down

cheeks

JEANNIE
Daddy says I can stay

Jeannie wriggles away towards Lucys doorway Lucy
several steps toward Matt who obviously fears the
exchange
LUCY
I no think you can give her what
pleases when she act like this

Because then she think

Matt is very much like a fighter taking a great deal of
punishment knowing he is beaten but being told by his

he must make a fight of it He nods his head repeatedly
agreement

MATT
I know I know

Now he sniffs the air in quick rhythm hoping to draw
some courage and resolve He moves to Jeannie
MATT
Youll see Lucy in the morning Were

going home

JEANNIE
No Im not STOP

HER POV

Matt upset in a way he has never imagined as he pops
beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and

to read a book on child behavior modification

ON JEANNIE

Feeling the restrictions of her punishment pacing and
she begins to wail THIS LONELY LIFE Few adult women
sung with such appropriate passion out of need and
aloneness and confusion The song finishes Jeannie

huddled

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY
This rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for

Pictures There are a few tables snack machines and
umbrellas The whole D staff is there including

having lunch along with Claire the casting assistant
the bg we see Matt huddled sitting on the roofs
green outdoor carpeting feeling much the same as
the previous scene
ON MATT
Off in the distance the Popcorn execs contentedly ply
trade As he overhears their conversation and the words
to register in all their horror

MILLIE

Will somebody take a minute to look
over my casting list before Burke
gets here

MALE D PERSON
(scanning list)
This isnt so great Millie

MILLIE
Well I wanted to put in people we
had a shot at getting

MALE D PERSON
(reading from list)
F Murray Abraham Jeff Daniels Ed
Harris John Lithgow Rip Torn Willem
Dafoe John Malkovich For an action
lead

MILLIE
Could you at least take it one person
at a time instead of

MALE D PERSON
Okay Lets play State the
Obvious F Murray Abraham has a
nose as long as an Aspen ski line
Ed Harris is losing his hair Joe
Mantegna has never played the lead
in a big movie Willem Dafoes

when he takes off his shirt
Malkovich

Matt can take it no more He hears a loud voice coming
from
his own throat He wigs out

MATT
I cant stand it anymore I cant

CATHY
Whats wrong What happened

MATT
What in Gods name are you doing
in this job you have

SHOT
As they all start to answer at once

MATT
I mean him What in Gods name do
you know about casting

MALE D PERSON
Me

Matt rises and walks towards the Male D Person

MATT

Yes What do you know About anything
You dont even know you have a habit
of touching your tongue with a finger
like you want to lick yourself

(note this is his

little habit)
Yet you talk like you actually know
something So I want you to tell
me

(louder)

-what you know

MALE D PERSON
Im not going to be drawn into this

MATT
Ive been an actor most of my life
and this is the first time Ive ever
heard what the people calling the
shots sound like when theyre casting
So I really want to find out what
if anything you know because what
if nothing you know

FEMALE D PERSON
I dont think the yelling is
necessary

MATT
Oh you couldnt be more wrong And
Im not talking to you And I dont
like you

MALE D PERSON
How about you just mind your own

business

Matt is very close to him--he shakes his chair

MATT
Youre minding my business Thats
the problem so just tell me

what do you know
around

reach

complicated

ON MALE D PERSON

Matts manner is threatening The Male D Person looks

for some support and finds little then Matts tone
changes its reasonable almost seductive
MATT

Just tell me and Ill shut up

MALE D PERSON
(taking the bait)
First of all Ive been going to
movies since I was six for Gods
sake

MATT
What you know is the size of a
schnozz What you dont know is that
these guys
(indicates list)
are for real

ON CATHY

She is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says as he
continues to indict the Male D Person and unknowingly

her instead His fury grows and becomes more
containing an element of mourning

MATT

(again)
that they can make something
happen and even they dont know
hat that is till they get in there
nd play a little they can make
omething happen that you cant even
magine and its not your fault
his stupidity cause youre just
his scared little prick who gets to
ay hes making movies and the only
hing they ever taught you is that
hat you like doesnt matter

ZEtunttpeuo s

MALE D PERSON
(frightened)
Thanks for understanding

The anger leaves Matt He is depleted
MATT
But isnt it almost good manners for
you to feel a little shame

Cathy rises and begins to exit

MATT
(again)
I didnt mean you

CATHY
If you didnt you sure should have

She exits The D Persons Colleagues have taken

advantage of
the beat to egg him on

MALE D PERSON
You talk about manners--are you
actually so bitter you dont realize
how you acted just now Youre gone
pal But at least know that we cant
help that were making it

MATT
Oh shit You win You got lucky
with bitter That word just scares
me to death

INT STAIRWELL - DAY
A distraught Cathy is walking down as Burke bounds up

BURKE
You look down

CATHY

BURKE
Thank you I appreciate the support

CATHY
Im not down for you Im down about
myself

BURKE

(not hearing)
Oh What if Ground Zero doesnt do
well this weekend

CATHY
Please listen to me
He nods but she pauses disconcerted

BURKE
What

CATHY
I just got this feeling of seeing
myself talking to you and how this
is the most important moment of
ever

BURKE
(brusquely)
Okay Good What is it

CATHY
Ive been watching this company make
movies that cost tens of millions of
dollars and all the while Ive known
about this wonderful script which we
can somehow own and we could make
for about 14000000 3000000
if you can live without stars or a
name director

BURKE
Is that it Okay send me

CATHY
Ive sent you coverage on it nine
times I swear to you Burke it
will work Youve never heard me say
that

BURKE
How about last night

CATHY

(an unexpectedly fierce

outburst)
I dont know anything about action-
adventure

(on his look she

gains control)
I have no idea where that came from
Hey I know everyone thinks I dont
have any commercial sense because of
what I said at the Gremlins preview
and all And you think I cant put
myself on the line Well if this
picture doesnt work fire me Have
me killed if it doesnt get good
reviews If this doesnt get a 70
percent definite recommend from women
49 and under I promise to be your
sex slave until they drop ticket
prices back to five bucks and start
enforcing the R rating

BURKE
Youre selling very excellent Very
excellent presentation

CATHY
Youve got to do this I think this
movie can save me

BURKE

into a pink childs cassette player and MUSIC BEGINS
Jeannie sings along with the childs chorus on the

YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL making with little hand

the last thing Matt needs but in due course he

actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his

troubles and into the

fact that his daughter is

But before the mood can fully sweeten Jeannie forgets

lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the

continues to play

JEANNIE
I cant even remember the words I

As Cathy drives past some rough examples of street

in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own
expensive system and gets out

quick and push hard

In the bg WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father
make the person wait till shes finished dressing
the SOUND OF the buzzer Cathy hurls herself at the
good four times before finally timing it right and
the necessary strength to spill through
INT MATTS HALLWAY - EVENING
Cathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside
JEANNIES VOICE
But why cant I stay just a little
while
MATTS VOICE
Because this is a very special friend
of Daddys and I need privacy Be
fair I let you wear that dress

Cathy knocks Matt opens the door

MATT
Hi

He steps aside so Cathy may enter The place is
He has changed his clothes and Jeannie is wearing a
dress fit for a young princess complete with flowered
and ballet slippers with trailing blue ribbons at the
and a velvet cape
MATT
This is my daughter Queen Elizabeth

Jeannie this is Cathy

CATHY
Hi What a pretty dress

No Youre going next door

Jeannie is crest-fallen for a horrible second it
looks as

if she may start to wail Matt moves into action with
pep talk

MATT
Remember our compromise Youre going
next door to Lucys to play and youll
show the kids your dress and Ill
come get you later and well go out
someplace and Ill buy you anything

She starts for the door doubles back and kisses a
surprised

Cathy full on the lips The gesture is beautifully
even

movingly carried off It is totally false

JEANNIE

Goodbye I love you

CATHY

(totally thrown)
Well thank you

Jeannie is on the run as she passes her father
MATT
(sotto)

Jeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past

Favoring Cathy Matt leans out the doorway until
Jeannie is
safely next door then re-enters

CATHY

Well come on whats original And

(how quickly status

changes things)
Or come on over

INT BURKES BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

A post-coital moment though only the man is visible

Burke
who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing
else
Nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is
recovering
from the deepest orgasm of her life
BURKE
Why not If you can test movies and
premises and want-to-sees why cant
you test screen tests
Nan hauls herself into view climbing back onto the
bed

NAN
I cant deal with your self-centered
dribble right now I have just had
the biggest orgasm of my life and
Im trying to figure out if Im in
love with you

BURKE
What
NAN
Whoops Tell me what made you rush
over and pick me up and bring me
here at six oclock I mean we seem
to have

She closes her eyes in a characteristic and touching
gesture
as the scientist in her struggles to be precise

NAN
(again)
this unspoken agreement not to
talk about why were together when
were together and I dont think
its good to let that become a pattern
for us

She focuses again on Burke Prepared for at last some
verbal
intimacy

BURKE
Why did I rush to you Because I
felt like I had to be with someone
and you were closest
(on Nans reaction)
Whats wrong

NAN
Youre not at all aware that youve
just said something
(her eyes close)
-unattractive

BURKE
Look Im sorry if that came out

NAN
m not looking for an apology

BURKE
m just trying to say that one of
the things Im not great at is

NAN

Lets not make this about your
shortcomings Im sure youve had
enough of those conversations to
last you a lifetime What Im

BURKE
No I havent

NAN
No you havent what

BURKE
Had a conversation about
shortcomings

NAN
(aghast)

No woman has ever told you that you
have an almost barbaric insensitivity
That you seem to have lapsed into
some final cynicism where you
actually believe that not only does
everyone think the way you do but
only you have the courage to express
it That you seem horribly certain
everyone else is sort of pretending
when they talk about love or seem to
care for anything outside their own
anus No ones ever said that sort
of thing to you

BURKE
Oh yeah But I didnt get what
you meant by shortcomings Hey if
you think things like that what are
you doing here

NAN
(indignantly)
Im here for the same reason 86
percent of older women loved Beauty
and the Beast I would like to
believe that underneath the creature
there is a sweet caring guy

BURKE
I sure hope youre wrong

Nan breaks up shaking her head ruefully

NAN
I have to pick up Leslie

Burke not having intended humor is also lighthearted
having
somehow avoided a tight spot

rings

EXT CATHYS HOUSE - NIGHT
Matt holding the script walks the small lane through
tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage We HEAR
from inside (A soundtrack) There is a note on the
which is slightly ajar reading Come right in if you
it--ring if you have reservations Matt enters
INT CATHYS HOUSE - NIGHT
White walls thick rugs great great fantasy garret
but cozy He walks a step then there is a girlish
and a naked Cathy streaks the rest of the way to her
from the bathroom
CATHY
(calling)
I mistimed it
(sticking her head
out the door)
I wanted you to catch me fully
frontal
She smiles broadly hurriedly putting on something
loose to match her buzz As she walks to him the phone

She ignores it

CATHY
So you loved it A lot A little

MATT
Give me a second--all of a sudden
theres a lot to deal with

She sits on the sofa--looking at him

MATT
(again)
Its terrific

CATHY
(pointedly)
Do you see why I think youre right
MATT
Because youre nice and you know I
need work

CATHY
(Lower)
You know this is really happening
so I wish you wouldnt kid around
about it

MATT

Sorry but I think the audition rule
is that I have to be serious unless
the person in charge is wearing a
bathrobe and her nipples are sticking
out

(holds fingers apart)
this much

Cathy peeks down her bathrobe Then broadly

CATHY
There are some mixed signals coming
out of here arent there
(phone rings she

answers)
Hi Working I cant write down a
number now Call me back

(to Matt)

The script

MATT
Its really good I get a little
nervous thinking about the
opportunity

CATHY
I want to hear everything You want
to go page by page

MATT
If its okay I kind of work on these
things in a private its just
its a little better for me if I
dont

CATHY
(hurt)
Okay

MATT
Okay lets do it It wont kill me

CATHY
Please I understand

An uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses

him A
sound escapes him They get up and begin walking to the
bedroom
MATT
I swear to God I dont know which
thing I want more the sex or the
conversation afterwards
CATHY
(a smile)
What do you mean
INT CATHYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
As they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts
undressing
MATT
I mean I havent been to bed with
anyone since Jeannie got here I
havent talked to anyone the way I
need to
(cradling her breast)
I havent seen anything this
beautiful I havent felt this good
about life I mean Ive been lonely
Cathy
CATHY
(as he enters her)
Ill tell you the truth Matt Ive
never felt more like turning my phone
off
She twists her body gracefully sexily towards the
phone

MATT
You cant shut the phone off I left
this number with Jeannies sitter

CATHY
I dont understand what youre worried
about
MATT
Im not worried But if the phone
was off I would worry

CATHY
But I get a lot of calls

MATT
Oh
CATHY
I could put the machine on monitor
but its going to be I dont know
MATT

It will be okay I think the most
important thing is to stop talking
about the phone Turn it off monitor
whatever

CATHY
Okay

She twists toward the phone again--not quite so

beautifully
OTHER ANGLE
As she hits the monitor button then turns back to
him
CATHY
You look so serious
MATT
I am so serious
CATHYS POV
Matt totally there this is major for him then he
does
something sensitive reads her concern over the depth
of
his need and interest and shrugs indicating he cant
help
it
ON CATHY

She likes him

THE COUPLE
As they make love their union thrown off kilter by
the

phone messages which roll in periodically as they
thrust and

sweat towards intimacy

YOUNGER MALE VOICE

(broadly)
Hi Cathy All my magazines came

hate Spy is bad this month
Scorsese didnt get the Time cover

The love making continues as the calls continue

us

Cathy in the throes of sexual union feeling a bit
divided
by the offer on the phone she shakes it off

MATT
Is this the kind of crap you listen
to all day

CATHY
Please were making love here

BURKES VOICE
(incredibly depressed)
If the TV show bombs theres going

have a point anymore Im really
questioning everything including
action-adventure Dont tell anyone

The sound of a hang up the couple having more
difficulty

is with her)

EXT POPCORN MOVIES - DAY
As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene
this time they are reading children of varied ages and
kids and their parents are all over the stairs etc
is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically
as she makes her way through this world of the young
to Cathys hand as the kids sing their version of
BELIEVE--the stage parents taking one verse At one
Cathys begins talking to someone blocking Jeannies
JEANNIE
Get out of my way

CATHY
Dont say it like that

JEANNIE
Which way should I
(polite little girl)
Get out of my way

The words coming so fast that Jeannie lets loose with a

bolt
of SONG as if taking a moment to catch her breath
Just a
few sung lines proclaiming happiness
JEANNIE

And everybody went yea and they
said they wanted me to be on

CATHY

by the time she got back they had
offered her the part Blame Burke

fury is
professional curiosity

MATT
Whats the part anyway

CATHY
The white kid in a multi-racial foster
home with all these kids of varying
ages Its not a bad show I sure
cant wait to see the test

MATT
How were they able to test her so
fast

CATHY
No They offered it to her off the
reading I meant your test

MATT
Oh A child actor Just what any
kid with problems needs to straighten
out--a series of her own

Cathy has nothing to offer Matt begins leading her
back We

HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matts
confidence

leans
into her

There is laughter in the room The actress smiles

through
her tears--pats Matt for being wonderful

ACTRESS

Ad-libbed enthusiasm mostly about the girl
ON CATHY
As the conversation about the girl grows more
pointed

Cathy impassive outwardly recoiling inwardly

concurring)

You wouldnt want to fuck him

FEMALE D PERSON
Well six years ago maybe

CLAIRE
I think hes talented and attractive

BURKE
So youd want to fuck him

CLAIRE
He might be light in that area

CATHY
The man is talented If you get one
of those directors who like actors
I think

BURKE
A director cant make you hot if
youre not hot Youll end up with
warm which is death

CATHY
(defending Matt
slightly)
We laughed

BURKE
Let me ask you something Would
you fuck him

CATHY
(wearily)
Everything doesnt boil down to

BURKE
Let me stop you before you embarrass
yourself

Burke rises and addresses his staff the camera has
his

back in the foreground as it MOVES TOWARDS A
RENDEZVOUS

Burke moving too as he continues

BURKE
(again)

We all can do our little lectures on
what things boil down to Everybody
else here was professional enough to
come out and say Id fuck her

I wouldnt fuck him and youre
ducking it I want you to forget
the acting stuff and totally focus
on the issue

And now Burke and CAMERA meet up--the effect being that
he

is talking directly to us as he continues

BURKE
(again)
We do have some kind of responsibility
to the audience You just saw his
screentest so if this is the
first time you saw the guy do you
come out thinking to yourself and

distance distraught and lost She sees Matt

JEANNIE
Theres such trouble

DIRECTOR
Shes very worried about being able
to pretend cry when she has to and
she doesnt get it about memorizing
Thats all

JEANNIE
(aghast)
Thats all

The Director beckons Matt to lead her away He does

JEANNIE
This isnt going to be good

MATT
Not with that attitude

She seems stung by this unusually vulnerable He
changes
tactics softening

MATT
(again)
Its just that they Well did

JEANNIE
(insulted)
I know what an audience is

MATT

Good Now because theres an
audience they want you to know all

and try hard I can help you

She grasps at this unlikely straw

JEANNIE
Can you help me to cry

Jeannie sits herself by the window protected by an
grill and sits listening to her mother There is about
pose something prescient unmistakably Jeannie will
this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of
guy but for now its her mother her crazy mother
blots out dread Matt is struck by how quiet and
Jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter

privacy Several beats Jeannie noticing her Dad

her--switching positions body language indicating that

wants to put him out of her mind then a thought
JEANNIE
Dad says hes going to make me to
really cry
MATT

Jeannie your moms not going to
understand what you mean

Jeannie shushes him resisting with surprising will and
strength when he tries to get the phone

JEANNIE

(to Matt)

Hes being terrible right now

(faster avoiding

Matt)
I love loved the coloring book you

MATT
Why dont you let me be on your side
for a second

JEANNIE
I cant even understand what youre
saying now

MATT
Do you know what trust means

JEANNIE
Not very

MATT
It means that even if something is
hard to believe you believe someone
you trust because you know he wouldnt
say it unless it were true

JEANNIE
I understand So I dont trust
anybody right

MATT
Yeah I think you get the concept

JEANNIE

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Burke and Nan eating together on an elevated balcony
overlooking the main eating area

BURKE
We look like jerks eating here this
early Everybodys going to think we
couldnt get a reservation for the
hot hours

NAN
Why do you do this to yourself Why
do you insist on eating dinner in a
restaurant where youre bound to see
all the people youre afraid of

BURKE
Im not afraid of them

NAN
What do you call it when you think

She takes this act
that what a group of people think of
you can confirm or destroy any decent
idea you have of yourself

BURKE
Normal

NAN
How did little Jeannie do today

BURKE
Isnt it something that they have
you testing the TV show

NAN
What I asked was how did Jeannie
do

BURKE
What are you talking about

NAN
Somebody else Jeannie How did she
do

BURKE
Dont talk to me like this

NAN

(really pissed)
I want to be treated as if Im really
saying words to you which you engage
and respond to I like Matt Id
like to know how his daughter did
So before you take your dance of
desperation across the restaurant
and I end up feeling so sorry for
you that I could die I would like
you to answer my question

BURKE
She did okay and dont worry about
Matt If the pilot sells his kid

will be making five thousand a week
So what do you know about People
Get Hurt

NAN
Im told that theyre not going to

release it

BURKE
I knew I knew What the hell are
you smiling for

NAN
Forgive me But telling you about
this latest failure of yours--it
pleases me I have no idea why

BURKE
I cant be with someone whos not
rooting for me

NAN
I think I am Its just that rooting
for you is a good deal more
complicated than you realize
(as he rises)
Dont go

BURKE
Dont worry Im not that mad I
gotta do this

MUSIC IN as Burke leaves the table This Dance of

Desperation is classical Burke himself lifting one of
the

women in greeting then as he puts her down

BURKE
(again)
Sorry I thought you were someone
else

As he continues to go from table to table
TIGHT ON NAN

As she looks down on him dying for him we HEAR her
sing

the song Poor Bastards Finally not only about
Burke--but

the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with Now

Nan can

take no more She exits

FULL SHOT - BURKE

As he sees her go past in the background he goes after
her

finally grabbing her near the Maitre D station This
just
as TWO IMPORTANT COUPLES arrive Burke frantically
tries to
cover

BURKE
Nan you know Victor and his wife
(he mumbles unable
to remember any wifes
name)
and Jay and his wife
(he mumbles)

NAN

Yes Im sorry I cant talk now Im
very upset about whats happening to
Burke so I just made up my mind I
cant be witness to it anymore if I
love him and I certainly shouldnt
be here if I dont so I was just
in the process of leaving when he
stopped me and you folks walked in
Im sure youve had something like
this happen to you some time some
horrible thing in your personal life
happening in public

They all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to
Burkes
amazement

NAN
(again)
Thank you for understanding
(to Burke)
Goodbye I wish only good things for
you even though I feel Ive been
really damaged by this relationship

She exits enormously upset Burke torn between
following

her and repairing the social damage But the couples
are

paying him no mind rather they are impressed with Nan
As

they comment ie

COUPLES
Wasnt that spectacular Ive never

seen anybody that secure

Burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him
as

just

which

cars and

contempt

Bastards

tentative

her

BURKE
Thank you Thank you Were very
close
EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The strains of Poor Bastards underscoring the moment
Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nans hand
as a valet brings her car
NAN
You dont understand that Im
exhausted from hurting Im through
with you
She begins to cry Ordinarily this would be a scene
would be unendurable for Burke However the lesson of
moment ago is not lost on him As people get out of
witness the sobbing Nan
BURKE
(to restaurant patrons)
Excuse me were working our shit
out Im sure it happened to you
you know private stuff in public
The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing
She drives off leaving Burke hurt and alone Poor
up and out
INT MATTS APT - NIGHT

as she talks to her father who sits watching intently
JEANNIE
I dont know if Ive been bad I

with encouragement Suddenly she is in his arms
hugging him
hard an emotional dam seems to have broken

JEANNIE
Oh I love you so much I love you
so much I love you so much

Matt holds on--clearly deeply moved Then he exercises
the

effort to control his emotions and speaks
surprisingly as

a Black woman

MATT
(as Black woman)

lot better Chile Cause it sure
goes a long way to cure what ails
me

JEANNIE

something resembling fleece which we now recognize as
the
strands of Jeannies hair being combed out to the side
by an
expert hair-dresser Jeannie is shifting nervously in
the
large room where each chair is filled with a child of a
different age and color In the bg we can HEAR the
voice
of the WARM-UP MAN

Rainbow House Just listen to our
band and Ill be back to tell you
more and make you love me
The audience laughs thinly The BAND PLAYS as someone
closes
the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage
sound
There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit
room
Jeannie sits between a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HISPANIC BOY
and a
FOUR-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GIRL The room is abuzz kids
running
lines and loudly talking this builds to a musical
life as
in our first audition scene there is a briefly sung
phrase

is a first of great moment in her life As they move

something her dad

MATT
Jeannie

She turns--sees her father and gives a small cursory
He moves quickly drawing even with her but still
a bit of space and a low-key pep talk

MATT
Just remember Youre not even here

little girl that youre pretending
to be who lives at Rainbow House
