NIGHT

Pitch darkness surrounds a narrow faced long thin nosed
blue round eyed girl dressed in grey robes TRIS 16 Around
her are 5 doors glowing pulsing

VOICE
(Hissed)
Choose Choose now my dear Choose
wisely youll live the rest of
your life there Don’t regret it

TRIS
(Panicked)
No Not now I need time I don’t
want to choose yet

VOICE
(Angrier)
CHOOSE

TRIS
(Pleaing)
Please I can’t

VOICE
Be that way and suffer the
consequences

Suddenly TRIS was falling and falling Looking around her
she doesn’t see the bottom and screams

INT TRIS’ BEDROOM - MORNING

TRIS jolts up in her bed and rubs her eyes She checks her
watch a simple watch with no adornments and sleepily gets
out of bed

TRIS
(To Herself)
Today is the day Testing day

She dresses in a simple grey robe and exits the room

INT CANTEEN - NOON

TRIS sits around a table with her brother CALEB and
neighbour SUSAN In the bg people gather in groups around
the canteen One group plays cards laughing and shouting
One group chats over books One group of all girls play hand-
slapping games One group debates
The people at TRIS’ table sit quietly A lady dressed
identically to TRIS steps into the room

LADY 1
(Shouting)
From Abnegation Caleb Prior

CALEB stands up and walks to the lady but hesitates and
turns around to face TRIS

CALEB
Good Luck Tris You’1ll be fine
And Susan as well

SUSAN nods her head in acknowledgement

SUSAN
Thank-you Caleb I’m sure you’1ll be
fine as well

TRIS opens and closes her mouth several times wanting to
speak

TRIS
Thanks brother

CALEB walks away and TRIS looks like she wants to say more
to CALEB

TIME CUT

INT CANTEEN - NOON

LADY 1 (0S)
From Abnegation Susan Black and
Beatrice Prior

SUSAN and TRIS walk to the exit and outside the cafeteria
and a row of ten rooms The rooms are separated by mirrors
SUSAN walks to room 5 and TRIS walks to room 6 SUSAN grins
at TRIS TRIS walks into room 6 and a dauntless woman with
small dark eyes wearing a black blazer TORI waits
inside TORI has a tattoo on her neck

INT TESTING ROOM - NOON

TORI
Don’t worry dear It doesn’t hurt
My name’s Tori now have a seat and
get comfortable

TRIS sits in the chair gracelessly and TORI attaches wires
to TRIS’ head

TRIS
Why the hawk

TRIS looks ashamed the moment she finishes asking TORI
laughs softly and looks amused

TORI
I’ve never met a curious Abnegation
before most certainly strange for
your faction I thought questioning
was considered vain and
unnecessary

Tris opens her mouth and closes it again like a fish TORI
looks at TRIS and just laughs gently not scornfully but
amused

TRIS
I’m just just taken back by the
tattoo We’ve never been allowed
them or anything else besides the
basics

TORI
That’s quite all right The hawk on
my tattoo in some parts of the
ancient world symbolized the sun
Back when I got this I figured if
I always had the sun on me I
wouldn’t be afraid not even in the
darkest of times

TORI passes TRIS a clear vial of liquid

TORI (CONTD)
Now Drink

TRIS
What’s this

TORI
Can’t tell you just trust me

TRIS tilts her head back and drinks

EXTREME CLOSE UP - TRIS’ EYES

TRIS’ eyes snap close
INT CANTEEN - NOON

TRIS stands in the empty canteen it is now snowing outside
There are two tables in front of her one holds a hunk of
cheese The other a knife over one feet long

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Choose

TRIS tenses up

TRIS
Why Why should I choose

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Choose

TRIS looks around her no one is there TRIS relaxes a
little and scowls

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONTD)
Fine Have it your way

The canteen disappears

DARK NOTHINGNESS

A dog with a pointed nose stands yards from her It crouches
growls and snarls TRIS stays absolutely still and proceeds
to bow The dog accepts the gesture and TRIS proceeds to
stroke the dog A girl appears dressed in white

GIRL WHITE DRESS
Puppy

The dog growls snaps and pounces towards the girl TRIS
hurls her body and pins the dog The scene dissolves

INT BUS - DAY

TRIS stands on a bus and looks around All the seats are
taken but one in the back TRIS moves towards the seat and
is stopped by a man reading a newspaper as he grabs TRIS’
arm and clenches the paper

MAN WITH NEWSPAPER
Do you know this guy

The Man taps the front page of the newspaper The headline
reads “Brutal Murderer Finally Apprehended” TRIS stares at
the paper blankly and shows signs of recognition
MAN WITH NEWSPAPER (CONT’D)
(Angrily)
Well Do you

TRIS looks thoughtful for a moment and seems scared TRIS’
expression changes to a blank one as she makes her decision

TRIS
Nope No idea who he is

The man snarls and leans close to TRIS’ face

MAN WITH NEWSPAPER
(Escalating)
Youre Lying You’re Lying YOU
LIAR

TRIS is visibly shaken

TRIS
(Shaking)
I am not

MAN WITH NEWSPAPER
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES

TRIS
Nope

MAN WITH NEWSPAPER
(Whispering)
If you know him you could save me
You could save ME

TRIS
(Hesitantly)
Well I Do Not Know Him

INT TESTING ROOM - NOON

EXTREME CLOSE UP - TRIS’ EYES

TRIS’ eyes snap open TORI is standing beside her with a
strange look

TORI
(slowly )
That was well perplexing

TORI stand slowly and leaves the room TRIS ponders at TORI’S
mysterious words The minutes drag on and TRIS becomes
worried TORI comes back in
TORI (CONTD)
Sorry to worry you

TORI’s expression changes and her posture tenses up

TORI (CONTD)
(Cautiously)
Beatrice your results were
inconclusive Typically the
factions would be eliminated stage
by stage You only eliminated 2 out

of 5
TRIS
(Surprised)

Two
TORI

Choosing the cheese would’ve
confirmed your aptitude for peace
and therefore Amity Choosing the
knife would’ve confirmed otherwise
You lied to the man on the bus and
your dishonestly ruled out Candor
only they tell the truth on that
one But that leaves us a problem
people who tell truth are Candor
and Abnegation

TRIS looks confused

TORI (CONTD)
But you threw yourself at the dog
in selflessness for the girl That
confirms Abnegation but on the bus
when the man said that you could
save him you didn’t tell the truth
Which rules out Abnegation

TRIS
(Interrupting)
Wait what does this mean for my
aptitude

TORI
Yes and No My conclusion is that
you display aptitude for
Abnegation Dauntless and Erudite
They are called

TORI tenses up and leans very closely to TRIS
TORI (CONTD)
(Very Very Softly)
Divergent

TORI rights herself back up

TORI (CONT’D)
Under no circumstance are you to
share that information with anyone
Absolutely no one never in your
life forever You understand

TRIS looks confused for a moment but nods

TORI (CONTD)
I suggest you go home and do some
thinking

TORI tenses up and grabs TRIS’ wrists as TRIS turns to
leave

TORI (CONT’D)

(Desperately)
Choose wisely Tris Wisely Choose
where you think you belong
sometimes YOU have to come FIRST
no one else YOU Choose for
YOURSELF and above all DON’T TELL
ANYONE

TORI lets go slowly as TRIS’ hesitantly turns and leaves

INT THE HUB’S LOBBY - DAY

TRIS CALEB and SUSAN stand together in a group of
Abnegation members They dress identically in gray shirts
and gray slacks The group enters the elevator taking up most
of the space The Amity dressed in bright colours attempt to
enter the crowded elevator and the Abnegation led by a Man
who looks like TRIS and CALEB their father offers Amity the
elevator The Abnegation walking in uniform follows TRIS’
FATHER up the stairs

INT CHOOSING ROOM - DAY

The room is arranged in concentric circles with a podium and
5 bowls in the middle and the 16 year olds stand on the
edges in alphabetical order The factions sit together in
groups (AmityPeace CandorTruth EruditeKnowledge
AbnegationSelflessness DauntlessBravery) TRIS’ FATHER and
MOTHER come up to her and CALEB
TRIS’ FATHER
(confidently)
Good Luck See you soon

TRIS
Thank-you father

TRIS’ PARENTS turn to CALEB but then TRIS’ MOTHER turns
back and clutch’s TRIS

TRIS’ MOTHER
(Whispered)
I love you Beatrice No matter
what Remember I love you

TRIS’ MOTHER forlornly turns away In the bg TRIS’ PARENTS
do the same to CALEB Then an Abnegation member stands up to
the podium and clears his throat

MARCUS
Welcome to the Choosing Ceremony
Today we honour the philosophy of
our ancestors which dictates we
each have our right to choose his
own way It was centuries ago that
our ancestors realized that war was
not born of ideology or beliefs
but the facets of mankind’s
personality of mankind’s nature
Factions were born of the belief
separated by the qualities they
believed responsible for the
world’s disarray

MARCUS waves to the bowl of earth

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Those who blamed aggression formed
Amity

The brightly clothes group smiles as MARCUS waves to the bowl
of water

MARCUS (CONTD)
Those who blamed ignorance became
Erudite

The group shifts as MARCUS waves to the bowl of glass
MARCUS (CONT’D)

Those who blamed duplicity created
Candor
The black and white dressed group looks to one another as
MARCUS waves to the bowl of grey stones

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Those who blamed selfishness made
Abnegation

TRIS moves and shifts in nervousness as her faction is
mentioned CALEB grabs her arms to steady TRIS and reassure
her MARCUS waves to the bowl of lit coals

MARCUS (CONTD)
Those who blamed cowardice were the
Dauntless

A group of tattooed and pierced people smiles

MARCUS (CONT’D)
These five factions have lived in
peace for many years coexisted in
harmony Abnegation provided the
selfless leaders in government
Candor provided the trustworthy
leaders in law Erudite provided
teachers and researchers Amity
has given us counselors and
caretakers and Dauntless supplies
us with protection from the
outside

MARCUS deliberately speaks the next words with emphasis

MARCUS (CONTD)
And from the Enemy Within But the
factions provided us also with
family purpose meaning and life
Apart from them we would not
survive for Faction before Blood
Therefore may this day bring new
initiates for a happier brighter
better future

The room erupts into applause MARCUS proceeds to read names
as the initiates proceed one by one to the bowls choosing
their faction

MARCUS (CONTD)
Caleb Prior

CALEB squeezes TRIS’ hand and hugs her one last time CALEB
brings his mouth very close to TRIS’ ear

CALEB
(Very softly)
Beatrice we should think of
family But But Sometimes we
must also think of ourselves

CALEB walks to the bowls and TRIS stands confused CALEB
takes the knife from MARCUS and presses it into his hand
drawing blood He stands over the bowls and very slowly and
hesitantly moves his hand to the bowl of water His blood
drops slowly into the bowl turning the water even redder The
room erupts into mutters led by the Abnegation CALEB is the
first Abnegation to transfer The Erudite looks smug and the
Abnegation tense

MARCUS
(Shouting)
Quiet Quiet Please

MARCUS looks down to the list

MARCUS (CONTD)
Beatrice Prior

TRIS walks very slowly and hesitantly over to the bowls The
room dead silent with indecision showing in TRIS’ eyes The
Abnegation tense up even more TRIS takes the knife and
draws blood from her hand shivering a little at the pain

EXTREME CLOSE UP - TRIS’ HAND

The blood wells up on Tris’ hand as her hand hesitates
between two bowls The blood drips onto the floor TRIS’ Hand
moves jerkily to one bowl and one drop of blood drips

TORI (VO)
(Desperately echoing)
Sometimes YOU have to come
FIRST CHOOSE for YOURSELF
Choose wisely

EXTREME CLOSE UP - DROP OF BLOOD

The drop of blood falls and falls and hits burning coals
The fire envelopes the drop of blood and burns stronger

TRIS turns to leave the podium and spots TRIS’ FATHER’S
EYES’ burning looking accusingly TRIS’ tenses up TRIS’
MOTHER smiles with tears in her eyes

EXT ROOFTOP - AFTERNOON

A train suspended on tracks 7 stories up roars by and a
stream of DAUNTLESS INITIATES jump out TRIS jumps out last
The Group walks to the opposite side of the roof where a
wrinkled dark-skinned gray haired Dauntless Leader MAX
waits for them

MAX
Several stories below is the
member’s entrance If you can’t
jump you don’t belong here
Initiates first

An ERUDITE GIRL gapes

ERUDITE GIRL
(Incredulously)
You want us to jump of a LEDGE

MAX curls his lips and looks amused

MAX
Yes

ERUDITE GIRL
Is there something down there to
catch us Water Mats

MAX
(Offhanded1ly)
Maybe Who Knows Volunteers

MAX steps aside and no one moves TRIS slowly and
hesitantly moves to the edge and looks down It’s 7 stories
high and at the bottom is a huge hole encircled by
buildings on all sides She looks up and at the hole again
and slowly bends her knees and jump It’s pitch black as TRIS
falls TRIS hits a net after a few seconds TRIS looks
relieved and shakily climbs off A Dauntless member with
deep-set dark blue eyes FOUR grabs TRIS’ hand and pulls
her up TRIS stands on a platform in an open cavern

FOUR
Can’t believe it A stiff first
Miraculous Probably why you left
in the first place What’s your
name

TRIS hesitates and FOUR faintly smiles
FOUR (CONTD)

Choose carefully you’1ll only pick
once

TRIS considers for a moment

TRIS
(with certainty)
Tris my name is Tris

FOUR holds up TRIS’s hand

FOUR
(Shouting)
First Jumper - TRIS

The crowd of Dauntless appear out of the darkness and cheer
FOUR pulls TRIS away as the next Jumper is heard

FOUR (CONTD)
Welcome to Dauntless

INT THE PIT - AFTERNOON

The initiates stand at the bottom of a huge underground pit
rising several stories high Caves are carved into the walls
for food clothing etc Narrow paths connect them with no
barriers The non-Dauntless initiates stand awed

FOUR
This is where we divide Dauntless-
born initiates Lauren is waiting
for you at the top of the Pit I
trust you do not need a tour of
this place

The Dauntless-born all hurry away and climb the pit with
deft skill TRIS looks around counting the initiates left
there are 9 TRIS’ abnegation uniform stands out from the
rest are Erudite and candor

FOUR (CONTD)
I normally work in Control but I
will be your instructor for the
next few weeks My name is FOUR

There’s a general murmur in the crowd at the name

FOUR (CONTD)
Is there a problem

The crowd silences immediately
FOUR (CONTD)

Now this is the Pit you will
learn to enjoy it

TRIS looks around there are no elderly Dauntless FOUR moves
into the light and his back is covered in a tattoo peaking
out from the collar of his shirt FOUR waves to the pitch
black right side of the Pit

FOUR (CONTD)
That will be the chasm Follow me
I will show you

The sound of fast moving water breaks the sound of footfalls
The initiates arrive at the edge and the floor drops off at
nearly vertically several stories There’s a river at the
bottom

FOUR (CONTD)
(Shouting)
Let this be the reminder that the
line between bravery and idiocy is
very fine One jump will end it
all It’s happened before and it
will happen again

The initiates murmur as they are led to the dining call
across the Pit The dining hall is full of people and
clattering silverware The Dauntless notice the initiates
and make noise applause stomps and shouts welcoming the
initiates

INT DINING HALL - DINNER

The initiates sit around a side table FOUR sits with them
The tables are laden with hamburgers TRIS looks at the food
confused

FOUR
It’s beef put this on it

FOUR passes tris a small container of red sauce ketchup A
Candor girl beside TRIS tall dark brown skinned with short
hair CHRISTINA looks surprised

CHRISTINA
You’ve never had hamburgers

TRIS
(Slightly Amused and
Curious)
NO
(beat)
So that’s what it’s called

CHRISTINA eyes widen ever furthur and looks shocked

FOUR
(simply)
Stiffs eat plain food extravagance
is apparently considered self-
indulgent and unnecessary food
clothing adornments everything

CHRISTINA’s expression changes from shocked to smirky

CHRISTINA
No wonder you left

TRIS rolls her eyes and giggles the sound still a bit
foreign

TRIS
Yup because of the food

CHRISTINA smiles and giggles and extends her hand

CHRISTINA
Christina from Erudite

TRIS accepts the hand and shakes it

TRIS
Tris from Abnegation

CHRISTINA
I can tell

INT OUTSIDE THE DORMITORIES - NIGHT

FOUR arrives leading the initiates He stops abruptly and
turns to face them

FOUR
We take initiation very seriously
so training is everything Some
rules you have to be in the
training room by 8 o’clock every
day Training is from 8 to 6 each
day with a break for lunch After
that it’s free to do whatever that
you transfers do There’s break
time between each stage

TRIS seems shocked by the concept of time off and free to do
whatever you want

FOUR (CONTD)
This will happen each and every
day Understood
The initiates all nod

FOUR (CONTD)
You can only leave the compound
with a Dauntless and beyond those
doors

FOUR gestures to the sturdy wooden door behind him

FOUR (CONTD)
Is where you will be sleeping for
the initiation There are 10 beds
and only 9 of you Evidently we
were expecting more to make it

CHRISTINA looks confused

CHRISTINA
But we started with 12

FOUR

(casually)
There are always at least one
transfer who doesn’t make it
Continuing on in the first stage
of initiation you are kept separate
from the Dauntless born but you
will be evaluated and ranked
together They will be better than
you so you must-—-

A Mousy haired Erudite girl cuts FOUR off

ERUDITE GIRL
Rankings Why are we ranked

FOUR
Your ranking serves two purposes
One only the top 10 are made
members Two the rankings will be
the order of your job selection
There are very few DESIRABLE
positions rank 5 or below and
you’1ll end up guarding the fence
with little chance of advancement
There are 11 Dauntless born and 9
of you 4 will be cut at the end of
the first stage the rest at the
end of the final test Those who
are cut must leave immediately and
be factionless

There is a murmur among the initiates at the word
factionless A broad shouldered Candor girl Molly
interrupts

MOLLY
That’s no fair The Dauntless born
have the advantage If we had known-

FOUR

(dangerously)
If you had known If you had known
what You wouldn’t have chosen us
If that’s the case then GET OUT
NOW If you really are us it
doesn’t matter you’re brave
BRAVE

FOUR turns around wordlessly and pushes open the dormitory
doors

FOUR (CONTD)
Enjoy Remember you chose us now
we have to choose you

INT DORMITORY - MIDNIGHT

TRIS lies awake staring at the ceiling the sound of 8 others
breathing in the background TRIS looks pensive and her eyes
tear up TRIS quickly dabs the tears out of her eye There’s
a soft strangled sob in the distance TRIS snaps out of her
daze and turns

EXTREME CLOSE UP - AL’S TEAR

A large and broad Candor boy’s AL eyes glaze A single
tear drips down his wet face slowly and very slowly falls
off his face and onto the ground

INT TRAINING ROOM - MORNING

FOUR stands at the front of the room containing shooting
targets punching bags sparring areas and different
varieties of fighting instruments and practice areas Another
DAUNTLESS with long dark and greasy hair cold eyes and a
face pierced in too many different places stands beside FOUR
the tension between them is very thick both standing tense
The initiates arrive and stand in a very straight line in
front of the two some of them nervous and others excited

FOUR
This is Eric he is a Dauntless
leader

FOUR gestures towards ERIC who just stands there with no
reaction

FOUR (CONTD)

You will learn how to fight to
prepare yourself to respond to
challenges For Dauntless it is
unthinkable to refuse to meet the
challenge That is life as a
Dauntless meeting the challenges
ahead head on Technique today
tomorrow youll fight Learn fast
and you won’t get hurt

The initiates each practice on a black faded punching bag
spaced 3 feet apart from each other TRIS tries out punch 1

FOUR demonstrates kick 1 with an explosive kick sending the
punching bag up and hits the roof

FOUR (VO)

INT TRAINING ROOM - PRESENT

TRIS tries kick 1 again the punching bag still barely
moves FOUR comes over and eyes her methodically and
calculatingly FOUR moves behind TRIS and suddenly puts a
hand to her stomach and pauses TRIS tenses

FOUR
(quietly)
Remember keep the tension here

(2 Beats)

FOUR retracts his hand and turns to walk away TRIS still
stands unmoving forgetting to breathe

FOUR (CONTD)
(beat)
Use your elbows and your knees

INT THE PIT —- DINNER

CHRISTINA elbows TRIS gently TRIS turns her head and looks
at CHRISTINA

CHRISTINA
That was insane He scares the hell
out of me that quiet voice he
uses

TRIS
Yeah he’s definitely very

TRIS looks for words

TRIS (CONTD)
Intimidating

CHRISTINA accepts that answer and nods A very large and
broad boy AL approaches them CHRISTINA spots him and
waves

CHRISTINA
Tris this is my uh friend from
my faction

CHRISTINA notices her mistake and quickly corrects herself

CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
My old faction Candor Al

AL reaches them and offers his had to TRIS

TRIS
Nice to meet you Al I’m Tris

TRIS takes Al’s hand

AL
Nice to meet you as well Tris

They let go and AL ponders and opens his mouth to say
something and closes it again and opens it once again

AL (CONT’D)
I want to get a tattoo you guys
coming with me

TRIS looks bewildered at this concept

TRIS
A tattoo of what

AL
I don’t know I just want to feel
like I’ve actually left my old
faction Stop crying about it

TRIS and CHRISTINA quickly look at the floor at the mention
of AL crying

AL (CONTD)
What I know you both heard me

TRIS and CHRISTINA smile at AL’s words and CHRISTINA punches
Al playfully in the arm

CHRISTINA
Yeah learn to quiet down will
you But you know you’re right if
we want to go all the way we’ve got
to really be the part

CHRISTINA specifically looks at TRIS when she says be the
part

TRIS
(defensively)
No I will not cut my hair dye my
hair or pierce my face or do any
of that sort of stuff

CHRISTINA drags TRIS by her wrist and pulls her into the pit
swarming with people AL follows them An erudite boy Will
approaches them and taps AL on the shoulder

WILL
Mind if I join you guys

AL looks suspicious
AL
Aren’t you supposed to be with your
Erudite buddies
AL points at EDWARD and MYRA

WILL
Nah they’re dating

WILL points at EDWARD and MYRA again they’re kissing now

WILL (CONTD)
I don’t want to be the third wheel

CHRISTINA looks at TRIS and sighs
CHRISTINA
(mumbled)
Your clothes
TRIS
(curious)
What’s wrong with my clothes
They’re not grey anymore

CHRISTINA
Come I’1ll show you

TRIS opens her mouth to protest but CHRISTINA silences TRIS
and drags her in a new direction

INT CLOTHING SHOP IN THE PIT - NIGHT

TRIS’ POV

TRIS’ eyes are closed as CHRISTINA is heard moving
mumbling

CHRISTINA
Eyeliner close your eyes tight

TRIS
You know you aren’t able to make
me look pretty

CHRISTINA
Watch me Besides who cares about
pretty I’m going to make you
noticeable

The sound of eyeliner being applied is heard

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
Okay open your eyes now

TRIS opens her eyes and in the mirror stands TRIS in a floor-
length black dress shimmering TRIS’ hair is now loose
hanging over her shoulders Her eyes are now piercing blue
not grayish dull blue Her features now fuller CHRISTINA
looks extremely proud of her work and gestures to TRIS

CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
(excitedly)
See Striking You like

TRIS

(beat)
Different like a different person

CHRISTINA gives her a funny look

TRIS (CONTD)
(hurriedly )
It’s a good thing Sorry it’s just
I’ve never been allowed to stare at
my reflection for this long

CHRISTINA looks shocked
CHRISTINA
That’s a real strange faction come

let’s go watch Al get tattooed

TRIS looks relieved at the change of subject and follows
CHRISTINA out of the shop

INT TATTOO PARLOUR - NIGHT

TRIS looks at Al’s tattoo of a spider with intrigue TORI
comes up to her and taps her on the arm TRIS jumps and
turns

TORI
Nice to see you again I thought
wed never meet again

TRIS’ expression suddenly changes as if she remembered the
importance of what TORI said to her testing day and the fact
that she seemed to be hiding something TRIS moves very close
to TORI and puts her mouth to TORI’s ear

TRIS
(Whispered)
I think we should talk sometime

TORI tenses and looks around her seeing no one of interest

TORI
(whispered)
I don’t think that would be wise I
can’t help you anymore

TORI’s posture changes

TORI (CONT’D)
(normal )
Want a tattoo

TRIS looks around and spots a flying dove design TRIS
points to it

TRIS
I want three of those Tattoos to
represent starting a new life
three to represent family I left
behind

INT TRAINING ROOM - DAY

ERIC and FOUR stand at the front of the training room the
initiates gather in front of them

FOUR
Over the next few days you will
learn to fight each other There’s
an odd number of you one of you
wont fight each day

The initiates all look at the list TRIS’ name is by itself
The rest are paired AL and WILL MOLLY and CHRISTINA PETER
and EDWARD DREW and MYRA

CHRISTINA
Looks like I’m paired with the
tank

CHRISTINA sights and TRIS looks at the list TRIS’ eyes fall
on the name beside CHRISTINA’s MOLLY

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
Yup Molly Peter’s slightly more
feminine-looking minion

CHRISTINA and TRIS look to CHRISTINA CHRISTINA in a group
with PETER and DREW They are all tall broad shouldered
bronze skinned and bulb nosed

MONTAGE
1 AL and WILL Fight punches exchanged AL wins

2 PETER and EDWARD fight evenly matched EDWARD wins in the
end

3 DREW and MYRA Fight DREW wins easily

4 MOLLY and CHRISTINA fight CHRISTINA is easily kicked to
the side by MOLLY as MOLLY assaults CHRISTINA over and over
again AL looks nervous as he watches the match TRIS is
intensely focused CHRISTINA attempts to move out of MOLLY’s
way but MOLLY pins CHRISTINA down and punches again and
again CHRISTINA’s jaw nose and mouth CHRISTINA screams
and screams as MOLLY continues to assault her

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
(wailed)
STOP
(beat)
Please I’m done
ERIC walks over to CHRISTINA furious

ERIC
You’re done Done

CHRISTINA weakly nods

ERIC (CONTD)
GET UP

FOUR walks up and grab’s ERIC’s shoulder

FOUR
According to Dauntless rules one
could also concede she did
concede

ERIC’s eyes narrow as does FOUR’sS

ERIC
According to the OLD RULES In the
NEW RULES no one concedes

FOUR
A brave man acknowledges the
strength of his enemies

ERIC
A brave man never surrenders

ERIC and FOUR eye each other for minutes as a clash of
different Dauntless ideals ERIC wins as he’s a Dauntless
leader ERIC motions to the entire group

ERIC (CONT’D)
Follow me

INT THE RIVER BY THE PIT
ERIC shoves CHRISTINA against the railing

ERIC
Climb over it

CHRISTINA looks dumbfounded

ERIC (CONTD)
(pronouncing deliberately
and slowly)
I said climb over the railing

CHRISTINA hesitantly begins to climb over the narrow metal
railing slippery with the spray of the river ERIC gives her
a shove and CHRISTINA speeds up

ERIC (CONTD)
If you hang over the chasm for 5
minutes your cowardice will be
forgiven If not well you better
hope the river makes a soft
landing

CHRISTINA gets to the top and slowly moves over shaking

CHRISTINA
(softly shaking)
Fine

INSERT - AL’S WATCH

AL sets his watch and the needle ticks TRIS AL and WILL
watch lips pressed together anticipation showing on their
faces The watch ticks to a minute and a half CHRISTINA’s
hands begin slipping just a little due to the water The
watch ticks to three minutes CHRISTINA’s slips even more
The watch ticks to four minutes thirty seconds and the river
hits the wall The white water sprays against CHRISTINA’s
back her face strikes the barrier and she cries out Her
hands slip and she’s just holding on by the fingertips of
her right hand CHRISTINA tries to get a better grip but
fails The watch ticks to 4 minutes 55 seconds

AL

CHRISTINA cries out again as her wet hands slip even more

AL (CONT’D)
1 second

AL turns to ERIC as the watch ticks to 5 minutes

AL (CONTD)
Time’s up

ERIC takes his time very slowly checking his watch

ERIC
Fine you can come up Christina

AL walks towards the railing

ERIC (CONTD)
NO Let her do it

AL
No she doesn’t her punishment is

ERIC doesn’t respond and walks away AL reaches over the
railing and grabs CHRISTINA’s wrists and pulls her up
CHRISTINA looks traumatized and her eyes skan our faces

CHRISTINA
(quietly)
Thanks

INT DORMITORY - MORNING

TRIS wakes up her face and body is covered in purple-blue
bruises TRIS rolls out of bed and sees that the word
“STIFF” has been spray painted in bright red paint on the
floor in front of her bed PETER the burly bulky transfer
from Candor walks in flanked by his two henchmen Molly and
Drew

PETER
Nice decorations Still a bit stiff
from our fight the other day are
we

TRIS quickly advances on PETER but winces because of her
injuries

TRIS

(dangerously)
Did I do something to you that I’m
unaware of If you haven’t noticed
yet

(beat)
Which I don’t expect you to we’re
in the same faction now

PETER

(lightly)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

(tightly)
And you and I will never be in the
same faction I thought you’d learn
that after our fight I distinctly
remember knocking you out

PETER leaves followed by his henchmen AL and CHRISTINA
walk in after a few seconds AL sees the paint and quickly
walks to TRIS followed by CHRISTINA

AL
Don’t worry about that we’ll clean
it up Peter’s an Idiot if you
don’t get angry he’1ll stop
eventually

TRIS looks unconvinced

TRIS
Yeah

CHRISTINA
Peter’s just evil spirited don’t
mind him he’1ll give up if he
doesn’t get his fun He used to do
bad things and pick fights with
the children from school and when
the teachers came he’d say that
they started it And everyone
believed him because he was in
Candor Despicable really

TRIS looks more convinced

TRIS
Yeah Al did you talk to Will
After well you know

AL

Yeah he’s fine not angry we all
know that if it wasn’t him it was
me

(Sighs)
Now I’1ll always be remembered as
the first guy who knocked someone
out cold

TRIS smiles

TRIS
There are worse ways at least they
won’t antagonized you

AL
There are better ways First

AL nudges TRIS TRIS AL and CHRISTINA notice the time and
quickly walks to the training room door They look at the
chalkboard and beside TRIS’ name is MOLLY

CHRISTINA
Oh no They’re making you fight
her

AL

Maybe you can just take a few hits
and pretend to go unconscious No
one could blame you

TRIS

TRIS (CONTD)
(determined)

FOUR moves to the arena

FOUR
Up first Tris and Molly

MOLLY walks confidently to the arena TRIS takes a deap
breathe and walks shakily to the area FOUR grabs her arm

FOUR (CONTD)
(quietly)
Attack first
(beat)
Youre fast

FOUR lets go of TRIS’ arm and TRIS continues shakily to the
arena

FOUR (CONTD)
(quietly)
You could win if only you could
learn to get them before they get
you

MOLLY smirks at TRIS

MOLLY
Ready to lose stiff Is that a
birth mark I saw on your ass this
morning

TRIS looks murderous and MOLLY suddenly makes the first
move TRIS ducks and drives her fist into her stomach MOLLY
doesn’t react to the punch and attempts to grab TRIS but
TRIS ducks and slips away TRIS punches MOLLY in the back
MOLLY doesn’t react to the blow TRIS sees FOUR standing
beside the arena right elbow bent at a right angle left
hand casually tapping it

FOUR (VO)
For those who don’t have much
muscle use your elbows and knees

MOLLY punches TRIS TRIS blocks with her forearms MOLLY
groans frustratingly and sloppily kicks at TRIS’ side TRIS
dodges and MOLLY loses balance TRIS rushes forward and
drives her elbow into MOLLY’s face MOLLY punches TRIS in the
ribs and TRIS stumbles MOLLY stands with her hands high
stomach and ribs exposed TRIS stands with her hands high
stomach and ribs exposed TRIS and MOLLY eye each other
TRIS rams her elbow into TRIS’ stomach MOLLY falls to the
ground and TRIS kneads her knee into MOLLY’s side

TRIS continues to beat MOLLY MOLLY moves to protect her
side and curls up

MOLLY
(whispered)
Please stop

TRIS
(angry)
NO HELL NO NOT after what you did
to me yesterday

INT DORMITORY - MORNING

TRIS enters the dormitory wearing only a towel she freezes
at the door PETER MOLLY and DREW stand in the back corner
laughing they turn and look at TRIS TRIS quickly walks to
her bed and fumbles at the drawer TRIS extracts a dress
PETER and MOLLY walk up behind TRIS and snicker TRIS turns
around and jumps TRIS tries to leave but PETER blocks her
way

PETER

TRIS

MOLLY
You look like a child Stiff No

government faction anymore Look at

DREW

her towel and yanks it off revealing TRIS’ naked body
PETER DREW an MOLLY laugh TRIS runs out

INT TRAINING ROOM - DAY

FOUR wraps his arms around TRIS and TRIS punches MOLLY

walk

TRIS

TRIS walks away

TRIS (CONT’D)
(to herself)
I’m fine I don’t feel guilty so

INT PIT - DAY

Parents and Adults mill around mostly Dauntless a few from
other factions The initiates all walk in Transfers and
Dauntless-Born They scatter to look for their parents

SERIES OF SHOTS

Peter stands with a tall man with busy eyebrows and a short
meek-looking lady both dressed in black pants and white
shirts

A Dauntless-born initiate with purple hair stands with a
woman with a pierced eyebrow and a tattooed father

Will stands with a woman in a blue dress very young similar
looking his sister

Christina hugs a dark-skinned woman in black and white a
younger sister stands beside them

TRIS’ POV

As she scans the crowd She sees initiates standing with
parents and Drew and Molly standing off to the side with no
family beside them Then Tris’ mother appears with gray
slacks and grey jacket buttoned at the throat Hair in a
simple twist and expression placid TRIS’ mother turns and
sees her and moves towards her

TRIS runs towards her mother tears jumping out of her eyes
she hugs her mother and collapses into her arms
TRIS’ MOTHER
(Whispered as she runs
her had over TRIS’ hair)

Beatrice

TRIS blinks and hugs her mother tighter

TRIS’ MOTHER (CONT’D)
Well look at you You’ve certainly
filled out Tell me how you are

TRIS
You First

TRIS’ MOTHER
(laughs )
Today is a special occasion I came
to see you so let’s talk mostly
about you It is my gift to you

TRIS
One question where’s Dad Is he
visiting Caleb

TRIS’ MOTHER shakes her head

TRIS’ MOTHER
Sadly no Your father had to be at
work

TRIS
(Looking Down)
You can tell me if he didn’t want
to come

TRIS’ MOTHER
Your father has been selfish
lately That doesn’t mean he
doesn’t love you I promise

TRIS looks shocked

TRIS
What about Caleb What about
visiting him

TRIS’ MOTHER
I wish I could but the Erudite
have been prohibiting Abnegation
visitors I would be removed from
the premises if I tried The
tension have never been higher

(sigh)
(MORE)

TRIS’ MOTHER (CONTD)
I wish it wasn’t this way but
there isn’t anything I can do The
lies they spread are greater than
ever now

TRIS
That’s terrible

TRIS’ mother looks around and sees Four She points at him

TRIS’ MOTHER
Who is that

TRIS
Oh just one of my instructors
Rather intimidating

TRIS’ MOTHER
He’s HANDSOME

TRIS
Yeah

FOUR moves down and heads over to TRIS and her Mother His
eyes widen at the sigh of TRIS’ mother TRIS’ mother seems to
recognize him TRIS’ mother offers her hand

TRIS (CONTD)
Hello My name is Natalie I’m
Beatrice’s mother

FOUR accepts the time and shakes it twice stiffly Both
stiff

FOUR
Four It’s nice to meet you

TRIS’ MOTHER
Four is that a nickname

FOUR
Yeas Your daughter is doing well
here I’ve been overseeing her

TRIS’ MOTHER
That’s good to hear I know a few
things about Dauntless initiation
and I was worried about her

FOUR
You shouldn’t worry

TRIS’ MOTHER
That’s excellent You look familiar
for some reason Four

FOUR
I can’t imagine why
(Coldly )
I don’t make a habit of associating
with the Abnegation

TRIS’ MOTHER
If you say so but don’t we all
know the truth
(Beat)
Few people do associate us these
days I don’t take it personally

FOUR
(Relaxing)
Well I’1l leave you to your
reunion

FOUR walks off and WILL arrives WILL’s SISTER CARA gives
TRIS and her MOTHER a withering look

CARA
I can’t believe you associate with
THEM Will

TRIS’ mother NATALIE purses her lips

WILL
Cara no need to be rude

CARA

Oh certainly not Do you know what

(points at NATALIE)
She is She’s a council members
wife is what she is She runs the
volunteer agency

(air quotes)
That supposedly helps the
factionless You think I don’t know
that you’re just hoarding goods to
distribute to your own faction
while WE DON’T GET FRESH FOOD FOR A
MONTH huh Food for the
factionless my eye

NATALIE
I’m sorry I believe you are
mistaken

CARA
Mistaken Ha Hilarious I’m sure
you’re exactly what you seem A
faction of happy-go-lucky do-
gooders without a selfish bone in
their bodies Oh definitely Right

TRIS
(Angry)
DON’T YOU DARE SPEAK TO MY MOTHER
THAT WAY OR I SWEAR I WILL BREAK

YOUR NOSE
WILL
Back off Tris
(beat)
You’re not going to punch my
sister
TRIS
Try me
(beat)

If you expect me to listen to
people who spread the lies of the
Erudite and of that hag Jeanine
then you will mistake me

CARA
Now how are you so sure they are
lies You haven’t personally gotten
involved with this government yet
you know nothing

TRIS

I may not know anything but I HAVE
MY CERTAINTY AND WITH THAT I WILL
PROVE YOU WRONG AND ON WITH THAT I
WILL GO UNTIL I PROVE ALL OF YOU
WRONG ESPECIALLY JEANINE Now I
suggest you move away and shut your
mouth before I seriously hurt you

NATALIE
Tris you’re not Come on
Beatrice We wouldn’t want to
bother your friend’s sister

NATALIE leads tris through the halls towards the dining
hall but turns suddenly into a side hall and rapidly moves
She stops and crouches near tris

NATALIE (CONTD)
I said no questions about me I
meant it

(MORE)
NATALIE (CONTD)
How are you really doing Beatrice
How have the fights been How are
you ranked

TRIS
Ranked You know that I’ve been
fighting You know that I’m ranked

NATALIE
It’s not top-secret information
how the Dauntless initiation works

TRIS
I’m I’m close to the bottom Mom

TRIS looks down in shame

NATALIE
Good
(nods )
No one looks too closely at the
bottom Now this is very good
news What’s more important was
what’s your aptitude results

TRIS looks conflicted and opens and closes her mouth

TORI (VO)
Don’t tell anyone

TRIS opens and closes her mouth again

TRIS
(hesitantly and softly)
They were inconclusive

NATALIE

(sighs)
I thought as much Many children
who are raised Abnegation receive
that result No reason they just
do You must be very careful during
the next stage of initiation
Beatrice Stay in the middle no
matter what you do no attention to
yourself Understand

TRIS
(surprised)
What’s going on

NATALIE
I don’t have much time but
remember I don’t care what faction
you chose I am you mother and I
want to keep you safe

TRIS
Is this because I’m D-

NATALIE cuts TRIS off immediately

NATALIE

Don’t ever say that word ever
TRIS

Why
NATALIE

I can’t say
Footsteps shuffle in the distance

NATALIE (CONTD)
I don’t have time now Visitng day
is over but there’s something you
should do If you see your brother
go find him and tell him to
research the simulation serum
Okay Can you do that

TRIS
Not unless you EXPLAIN some of this
to me Mom You want me to go to
the Erudites at least give me a
reason

NATALIE
I’m sorry I can’t I have to
leave but tell your brother and
don’t seem attached to me or your
brother

TRIS
I don’t care what I look to them

NATALIE
But you have to YOU MUST I
suspect they are already monitoring
you Have a piece of cake for me
all right The chocolate It’s
delicious baked by Tori we had a
good long history

NATALIE runs off into the distance and TRIS follows NATALIE
climbs up the wall with ease and on the ankle of foot a
tattoo TRIS sees and her eyes widen and she runs after
NATALIE

TRIS
Mom Were you Dauntless

NATALIE is no where to be seen

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

ERIC stands holding the list of rankings for stage one of the
initiation in the shadows invisible to eyes stands Jeanine

JEANINE
Eric I trust you know what to do
with the next section of the
initiation Watch for the signs

ERIC
And if I find them

JEANINE
Contact me and we will figure out
a PERMANENT solution to the
problems Especially her her
result was manually logged and
Abnegation

ERIC
But she displays perfect Dauntless
principles I expected much less
than what I have seen from her I
don’t think she will be a problem
she is not a problem to us I don’t
think she displays the attributes
Her slugging of Molly was
particularly brutal and Dauntless

JEANINE
Trust me remember my IQ is so much
higher than yours I got you this
job you know why we selected you
to carry out the Erudite
collaboration with the Dauntless I
trust I know where your loyalties
lie

ERIC
Yes ma’am

JEANINE
(tightly)
Good

JEANINE leaves heels clicking ERIC goes in the opposite
direction and takes a left going up to the wall outside the
dormitories He posts the list up on the board and the
transfer initiates all crowd around it TRIS AL WILL and
CHRISTINA stand near the back ERIC leaves as FOUR enters the
room and takes ERIC’s place in front of the list

FOUR
The ranks are here before you see
them there are some things that
need to be explained After the
first round of fights we ranked
you according to your skill level
The points you got are determined
by how you did relative to your
opponent You got more points for
improving and for beating someone
stronger If you have a high rank
you lose points for losing to a
lower ranked opponent

MOLLY coughs in the background

FOUR (CONTD)
Those who prey on the weak are not
rewarded THAT IS COWARDICE

FOUR glances at Peter

FOUR (CONTD)
Your rankings are separated by
Dauntless-born and Tranfers cuts
are announced tomorrow

TRIS AL CHRISTINA and WILL rush up to see the rankings
THey read 1 Edward 2 Peter 3 Will 4 Christina 5 Molly
6 Tris 7 Drew 8 Al 9 Myra The entire group looks
confused

MOLLY
(outraged)
How am I ranked lower than her
(gestures to Christina)
I beat her in minutes

FOUR
(smug)
Yeah And Your point being

MOLLY
I should be ranked above her

FOUR
If you intend on a high rank you
shouldn’t make it a habit to lose
to lower ranked opponents

MOLLY glares at TRIS and then turns on her heel and enters
the dormitories PETER and DREW follow WILL and CHRISTINA
slap hands and WILL hugs TRIS

WILL
Look at you Number six

WILL grins at TRIS

TRIS
(anxious)
Still might not have been good
enough

WILL
Don’t worry it will be We should
celebrate
CHRISTINA grabs CHRISTINA and AL’s arm
CHRISTINA
Come on Al You don’t know now the
Dauntless-borns did You don’t know
anything for sure we should still
celebrate while we still can
AL looks at his feet
AL
(mumbled)
I’m just going to go to bed

AL pulls his arm free and slouches into the dormitory

INT DORMITORY - MIDNIGHT

PETER stands in the darkness barely visible He stands over
a bed raises his arms he holds a knife in his hands

ANGLE ON - KNIFE IN PETER’S HAND

The knife is slowly raised and shakes Then the knife
suddnely plunges

A scream rings out EDWARD’S scream The entire dormitory
springs into action

CHRISTINA
Someone turn on the lights

The lights flicker on and EDWARD lies on the floor next to
his bed clutching at his face A halo of blood surrounds his
head and a knife juts out of his face

CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
Isn’t that the butter knife from
the dining hall

MYRA walks up to EDWARD and screams Someone else screams
and in the distance someone yells for help The sound of
vomit rings

EDWARD
Take it out It hurts Take it out

TRIS kneels next to him

TRIS
No You have to let the doctor take
it out Hear me Let the doctor
take it out Now breathe It will
be all right

EDWARD
It hurts

TRIS
It will be all right now breathe

The DAUNTLESS nurses arrive and carry EDWARD out of the
room TRIS’ hands and knees are now soaked in blood PETER
enters the room

INT DINING HALL

TRIS sits at the table with CHRISTINA AL and WILL eating
steak

CHRISTINA
Did you hear Edward and Myra
quit

TRIS

Really Myra
CHRISTINA

CHRISTINA
Yeah she was going to get cut

didn’t want to be here without him
anyways

WILL
Anyone find out who the two
Dauntless-born that got cut were

AL
Nope but at least I didn’t get
cut

TRIS and WILL all stare at AL

AL (CONTD)

What I was going to get cut if
Edward didn’t quite You know it’s
true
