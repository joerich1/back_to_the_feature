1- EXT RUSSIA -- NIGHT

We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post He is
wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
jacket Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian)

He sucks in a cigarette as though hes a drowning man lookin
for oxygen A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post the
guard looks asks a couple of questions and is given an
-envelope which he quickly examines he then attempts to stick
his head in the car A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his
face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back the
guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier

down and a gun barrel is stuck through The RUSSIAN DRIVER

looks dramatically calm

RUSSIAN
Pass him the money
Franky hesitates for a second

RUSSIAN (CONTD)

Franky you know you have no choice

So please can we get on with it
Franky knows discussion is futile He flips the case open
and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American
dollars The package is pulled out of the window the driver
doesnt move we dissolve for a passage of time the anxiety
is more than obvious but Four Fingers can do nothing All
of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car
speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery

Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of

a fist He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin
monocle to his eye Hes satisfied

money in the car wash machine

sOoL

Can you get this fuckin dog to stop
dribbling on me
Vin pulls the dog back

SOL (CONTD)

sure they would lick the salt of
your scrotum

The car wash starts

VINNY

What the fuck are you doing
TYRONE

I never do a job unless I have a

clean car I like to make my wheels
look crisp

VINNY

Are you serious You re a getaway

driver youre not here to show your

fuckin car off me
The machine starts They do the windows up and that point
the dog lets out a fart The water starts to hit the
windshield so they cant undo the windows There is more an
atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger

EXT CARAVAN CAMP SITE

Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their
Land Rover and pulls away They wave at Micky and he
reciprocates

MICKY

Hes a good dog Hell get a little

homesick for a while but hell get

over it
Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky
sitting next to him

INT CAR -- DAY

TOMMY

I dont know what all your fuss was

about They arent bad fellas
Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and
the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop
The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the
campsite

EXT CARAVAN -- DAY

They are looking at the damage Of course it

useless now

GORGEOUS GEORGE

Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesnt get a chance

MICKY (CONTD)

Look I have helped ya as much as I

car and I suggest you use it before

There is a silence for a while The atmosphere has gone
more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around

GORGEOUS GEORGE

Hey
Interrupted

MICKY

It was only a question of time before
you got some attention Nobody brings
a fella the size of you unless they
are trying to say something without
talking

TOMMY

Just give us my money and you can
keep your caravan

19

MICKY
Why the fuck do I want a caravan

concerned for his mum Pause as Micky waits for her to be
well gone

MICKY (CONTD)

I 1 1 fight you for it

Tommy looks at Gorgeous George Gorgeous George raises his
eyebrows

INT HORSE BOX PIKEY CAMP -- DAY

The two fighters start pacing It looks a bit ridiculous
Micky is dwarfed by comparison Gorgeous George takes a

swipe it was an impressive punch but Micky is a quick littl
bastard and sidesteps Micky does nothing to retaliate his
hands are still by hisside

Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and
groin picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him
against the car door All eyes are on Micky for a second or
two then he rises and appears little bothered by this he
gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again hardly
even looking at the big man

GORGEOUS GEORGE

You want to stay down my friend I
promise you you want to stay down
Micky ignores this and continues to pace the big fella grabs
him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable
door There is a terrible noise

GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONTD)

Now you fucking stay down boy or you

wont be coming up next time
It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour
that might have been around has now evaporated Micky raises
his head there is still no damage to speak of All of a
sudden he starts jumping up and down like hes warming up
throwing a few shadow punches taking off his shirt This
reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso and underneath
these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect

GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONTD)
This is sick I am outta here
MICKY -

Youre not going anywhere my friend

You stay until the job is done
Micky starts pacing and throwing out a couple of shadow
punches with his back to Gorgeous George he still hasnt
really acknowledged his opponent Gorgeous George moves in
for the coup de grace Micky spins on his feet and catches
the big man under the jaw

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a

head the size of a water melon There is blood streaming

out of every orifice in his head - hes inbig trouble We

are in slow motion- theres a lot of activity going on around
the body on the floor their mouths are open but we cant

hear what they are saying all we can hear is the voice over
given by Tommy

TOMMY (VO)

This isnt good if George doesnt
wake up in the next few minutes I

(MORE)

20 TOMMY (V O ) (CONTD)

have a problem I am scared really
fuckin scared There is something
coldblooded and practical about what
these people are thinking They

will pop me like a hot sausage if
George doesnt wake up Why do they
want to go to the trouble of
explaining why a man died ina
campsite These people dont exist
in society you cant find them
they live under their own laws and
ignore everybody elses I am scared
I am really fuckin scared

21 INT AMUSEMENT ARCADE 1 -- DAY

We see Turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his
face he has his customary pint of milk on one side he takes
a sip and ohhhs and arrrs for a while

TURKISH

run you through if Gorgeous hadnt
woken up

TOMMY

No his Mum stopped it If his Mum

TURKISH
What were you thinking of Why the

into a bare knuckle boxing match two
days before he had to fight the
Bomber

TOMMY

He was half his size
He pantomimes a man that would reach his navel

TOMMY (CONTD)

I didnt expect him to get hurt
TURKISH

You put the man into a bare knuckle

boxing match
He raises his voice

21

TURKISH (CONTD)

donut Tommy you did

TURKISH

hospitalized boxer and a good deal
Pause there is no correlation as Tommy knows

see they are accompanied by the muscle

The heavy walks over to Brick Top The heavy taps him on

the shoulder and whispers He acknowledges and gives his
drink to the heavy He walks over There is a cage next to
Brick Top which has a pit bull in and Brick Top who is
carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors The dog
snarls back

TYRONE
He swallowed it
The dog looks up having completed the task Vin who looks

29 EXT AIRPORT --
Doug and Alex are waiting to pick- up Hands
DOUG
Did you get Hands that car
ALEX

Doug is in shock

DOUG
What do you mean one like it
ALEX

I got him the Volante
DOUG

What did I say What exactly did I
say

ALEX
You said get him the Vantage
DOUG

Thats right I clearly said get him
the Vantage So why did you get the
Volante

ALEX
Because they look the same
DOUG

The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for young woman in
to the Greek word for virgin
because they thought they looked the
same coming up with the prophecy
behold a virgin shall conceive and
bear a son But there is a world
of difference between a virgin anda
young woman like there is between a
Volante and a fuckin Vantage
Pause she thinks about this

ALEX
Are you saying that the fact that
your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
instead of a Vantage is a profound a
mistake as a whole religion

DOUG

Yes I fuckin am

(MORE)

DOUG (CONTD)

Cars are his religion He can drive
a Valiant in the States but I cant
drive a Vantage because they wont
tolerate the emissions Well its
too late now thats Concorde

SHOT OF CONCORDES WHEELS TOUCHING DOWN

30 EXT AIRPORT -- DAY

Doug
He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug

Sol shrugs

SOL

TYRONE

What are we waiting for
SOL

We are waiting for a man carrying a
case

TYRONE

31

SOL

Because the deal is that we give the
Russian the case and we keep the
money

He rubs his fingers symbolically together
TYRONE

Whats in the case
Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone

SOL

Fuckin ell Tyrone you ask a lot of

questions You concentrate on the

driving okay
He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies he
is carrying a case

SOL (CONTD)
Shit was that him
VINNY

Dont ask me youre the one supposed
to keep an eye on it How many
fingers did he have

SOL

Are you serious I am sorry but I
couldnt get the binoculars out in

VINNY

Well lets not stand on ceremony

They get out of the van and go up to the bookies leaving
Tyrone in the van Theres a double set of glass doors
Sol pushes them open and Vinny walks in first while Sol
hangs back with the shotgun

32 INT BOOKIES -- DAY
Inside is the MAN with the case busy filling in a slip and
TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter Vinny doesnt mince
around and goes straight to the counter where the HEAD CLERK
PAULINE comes up to help
PAULINE

Yes sir how can I help

32

VINNY

You can start by giving me all your
money

PAULINE

Does Sir know who this bookies belongs
to

VINNY

It belongs to me now
Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing
Pauline
looks more than a little concerned

VINNY (CONTD)

If you know whats good for
He is cut short as Pauline triggers a button under the
counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid
rate of knots protecting all the counters This has the
unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it Poor Vin
is shot straight to the ceiling all we can see is half a
body and his desperately searching for ground legs Needless
to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state Hes
looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left
wondering what happened not having seen Vince impaled on
the ceiling Sol extracts the enormous shotgun

SOL
Vi nce Vince
He spins round looking for his colleague A muffled noise
tells him to look up 1
SOL (CONTD)
What are you doing Vince And what
the fuck are you doing up there
A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter
Sol panics some more and decides that emergency action is
called for
SOL (CONTD)
I have got your man out here If
you dont put down the screen Ill
blow his fucking head off You hear
me

PAULINE (OS )

I dont care you can do what you
like hes not related to me

SOL

You think you can try me

32 Sol raises the gun and fires into the side of- the wall

Theres an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in
the side of the wall The powerful kick from the gun also
makes Sol momentarily airborne

EXT BLACK GUYS VAN -- DAY

We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun

INT BOOKIES -- DAY

Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the
wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through

soL

Drop the screen now You just seen

what it did to this wall so think

what it could do to you
Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely
scared

PAULINE

(to the other clerk)
Do it I said do it
The screen comes down with a thud This means that Vince
comes down with just as serious a thud He lets out another
groan

soL

How you doing Vince
A weakened voice retorts

VINNY

How do I look like I am doing you

fucking idiot I would be doing a

lot better if you would stop using

my name
Consoled that his colleague is not dead its back to business
for Sol He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face
SOL
Now fill this bag --
PAULINE
All bets are off
sOL

I am not here to make a fuckin bet

34

PAULINE
All bets are off
SOL

Are you fuckin stupid I dont care
if the fuckin bets are off I want

PAULINE
If all bets are off then there cant
be any money can there
There is a pause Sol knows hes fucked She points to a
black board that clearly states ALL BETS ARE OFF
SOL

I aint buying that
PAULINE

I aint fuckin selling it its a
fact
Pause

SOL
Well what have you got
PAULINE

Nothing I mean we got a few coins
but no notes

VINNY

Can we just get out of here please
I am not feeling too funny
Sols temper does have a limit

SOL

Well I am not feeling too fucking
funny myself let me tell you
Sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case

SOL (CONTD)

Let me see your hands
The man holds his hands up He has got a perfect set of
five fingers on both hands Sol puts his head in his hands
Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on
the counter Sol picks them up and frowns hes not happy
with a bag full of change He puts his gun down and starts
to rifle through the bag Pauline can see Vinnys pistol on
the counter dropped after his encounter with the screen SOL (CONT D)

Copper coins What do you mean copper

fuckin coins
Pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol Sol goes
for it too but hes beaten to it Sol ducks pulling Vince
with him Pauline lets out a series of shots in their
direction Sol counter blasts over the top of the counter
The security screen comes flying back up

VINNY

Get me out of here now Sol
Vinny does sound convincingly desperate

soL

Were going Vin
He grabs the bag of copper coins grabs Vince and marches
towards the doubledoors They open the first set and then
they try to open the second They push the door nothing
happens There is no going back Sol starts to kick the
glass door but it doesnt budge With panic rising swiftly
Sol doesnt fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and
fires the bullet shatters the glass but it doesnt break
through and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors
shattering bullet-proof glass all around them Vinnys panic
filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory Sol is unaware
of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him Sol
fires another bullet Now he observes the problem and waits
for the inevitable The bullet tears through the bag of
coins which then empties its contents at Vins and Sols
feet Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh
Sol sinks to the floor he has given up Amongst the yells
emanating from Vince we can hear Sols pathetic and desperate
whimpering

SOL (CONTD)

No security eh
At that point Tyrone appears and pushes the door open The

door was open the whole time - only Sol was pushing it the

wrong way
TYRONE

What the fuck are you two doing
They stumble out into the street Vinny is in big trouble
They throw him into the van Just as Sol gets into the back
we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind Tyrone
pulls out And the rear doors of the van behind them fly
open Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this
van He was locked in due to the fact that the black guys
van was blocking his exit SOL

Tyrone get us outta here
Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky)
seeing that hes carrying a case and the case is connected
to his wrist

SOL (CONTD)
I said get us outta here Tyrone

We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van
He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van

There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun he
examines it and places it in his trouser front He then
turns to exit At which point there is a loud smash and
Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van)

WE CUT TO BLACK

Frankie wakes up He has a trickle of blood dripping down
the back of his neck he looks at his watch and panics He
kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens but on
the third kick the doors spring open Franky brushes himself
off and makes his way to the bookies

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES --DAY

We cut to Tyrone Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky
wrist Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky
Four Fingers head He falls to the ground Tyrone tries

to take the case off him but it s handcuffed to his wrist
So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in
to the back of the car with the other two

At which point Franky pulls out the gun from the secret
compartment in the case

FRANKY FOUR FINGERS

Now be a bunch of good fellas and
lie down on the floor

Tyrone goes for the big gun and Franky pulls the trigger
Nothing happens other than a big click there is silence for
a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut
eyes

understandably shocked and fires another It goes straight

through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind

CHARLIE

Go down-boy go down

Tony keeps going for him Charlie raises the gun and points
it at Tonys face and fires the last shot The bullet goes
straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
exits his cheek Tony is standing there with six bullet
holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet As he talks
blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is
frustrating the words

has set into Charlies face and has rendered him useless

soL

Let go of the gun

Vinny cocks his gun There is a pause and eventually Tony
lets go of it

BIT

I am talking for your benefit Now

dicks have drive and clarity of

vision
Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon
under the table unseen by the black guys He takes bits
out of one sock and bits out of another sock

BTT (CONTD)

But theyre not clever they smell
pussy and they want a piece of the
action and the dimmer the dick the
less he cares about the consequences
and you thought you smelt gooood ol

pussy and have brought your little

mincy faggot balls along for a gooood

ol time but you have got your parties

muddled up there is no pussy here

just a dose to make you wish you

were born a woman
We cut to the shell shocked brothers and the almost
completely built weapon

BTT (CONTD)

And just like a prick you are having

second thoughts youre shrinking

and your little balls are shrinking

with you
They stare on The brothers have lost this one and they
know it They start to reverse BTT lets the odd chicken
cluck out the corner of his mouth Vinny misses his step and
waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean They
back away into the corridor down to the back door of the

BTT can hear that the black guys and Hands have run into
each other and pulls out the complicated looking gun which
is now in one piece BTT cocks the gun and aims it at the

simulating the speed of their journey

109 INT CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

opportunity to duck Hands dives for cover too and drops

up and leg it

door behind them Vin looks uncomfortable Another door is
opened and a man brings out Lincoln Lincoln is in bad shape
and is relieved to see familiar faces they are now shut in
a room

soL
You alright Lincoln

ERROL

Do you know why the governor is the
governor

VINNY
Err

ERROL
I t s because people are scared of
him You know why they are scared
of him

sOoL
Err
ERROL

Its because of stories I am sure

youve heard one or two of those

stories For example did you hear

about the three black fellas that

did a very bad thing however they

made some effort to redeem that very

bad thing so the governor saw fit

not to kill em He thought it would

be a more advantageous concept to

let them kill each other and let the

survivor live to tell the tale

That way everybody wins well all

except the two that died of course
We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives
sitting provocatively Tyrone rushes for one of the blades
grabs it and runs at Vin Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps
running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun
at the last moment Tyrone slides the blade into Errol s
ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone The bullet
passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat Vin
Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just
happened

INT WAREHOUSE

Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse
He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of
encouragement and counter shouts Hes wearing a pair of
semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks
down the front Turkish walks behind him Micky still looks
bored He climbs into the ring Then from the same door as
the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with
a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a
frying pan HORACE GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON

THE REFF

Alright lads no eye gouging no biting
Do your worst Back to your corners

We drift again into Mickys pov his world is becoming more
and more surreal He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
words to him but hes not really listening A bell comes
from somewhere and Micky instinctively walks to the center
of the ring Good night is already there they pace one
another for a second or two Micky avoids a punch or two and
then he takes a hard one and he knows it we flash to white
Mickys in trouble he lets one of his missiles go and BANG

it shakes good night to his core all goes quiet We go
to super slow motion his knees buckle and good night is
in trouble Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
opponents knees threaten to betray him The crowd tries to
digest what is happening After a period of silence reality
dawns Brick Top mouths the words in silenceDonlt go down
you fucker The crowd wants Micky to finish the job But
common sense reins back the coup de grace Good night
eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward
after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
onslaught

TURKISH

I dont like the look of this Tommy

bring the van up to the back door
This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
seconds) We go in the mind of poor Micky We break the
music just as its starting to look dangerous The bell
goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner Turkish pulls him
back to his corner

TURKISH (CONTD)

They are on ya You got to hurt him

Micky Otherwise we are

rumbled you hear me Micky Do

-something it looks like it s rigged
Micky goes out again his hands are low BANG there is a flash
of white as Micky goes down in the dirt Dust rises from
where he fell He gets up quickly his hands are still low
BANG he goes down again in no time hes up

-

BANG he hits the ground again and this time when he hits

the deck he penetrates the dust covered floor like its
made out of water He falls through the water like hes
sinking his eyes are open and he cant breathe he continues
to fall but hes unpanicked (he is now Micky 1) When Micky

1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
kidney punches from Good Night hes winded and only semi-
conscious (this is Micky 2) Micky 1 makes the effort to

swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but hes stuck he
cant get through Micky 2 takes more punishment in the

ring as Micky 1 s hand continues to try to break the
underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
Micky 1 down again Micky 1 looks up again and sees how

much trouble Micky 2 s in the ring Micky 1 is panicking
now hes running out of oxygen and Micky 2s being beaten
Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
of his feet he looks up and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
hell his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
the floor And as the latter falls through Micky 1 manages

to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate

the surface The punch continues its trajectory and has the
power to fell a red blooded rhino it catches Good Night
on the jaw and its good night for Good Night its unlikely
that hell awake in the next hour Dear oh dear everybody

is in trouble

Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties
TURKISH (CONTD)

Tommy get the van

TOMMY

I have it its waiting
Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky

TURKISH

We are off Micky hold tight and

move quickly
Turkish pulls Micky away Its not as hard as it might be
trying to get out because the crowd seems to have found its
own disputes chairs start to fly Brick Tops boys are
frustrated in the mayhem Brick Top calmly dials into his
mobile telephone It rings

EXT CARAVAN PIKEY CAMPSITE

BTT opens a window The dog looks extremely relieved to
see
someone
HANDS

VINNY

He points to a pile of chewed up cushions

HANDS

He walks over and finds the remains of the box

VINNY (CONTD)

What do you mean have a look in the
dog

HANDS

I mean open him up
Tony is not sure about this

BIT

It s not a fuckin tin of baked beans

HANDS
I mean open him up
Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the
throat
BIT
Thats a bit strong isnt it

HANDS

You wouldnt have a problem if it
was a person

BIT

But its not its a dog and I have
never done a dog

HANDS

My heart bleeds
There is another pause

BTT
What dp I do
HANDS
Let me take a wild and reckless guess
Stick a knife in his guts and see if
its got a diamond in there Ill
hold it still andyou open it up
Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to
side
BIT
Fuckin hell alright then
VINNY

You cant do that

123 (-3)

HANDS
Well do it to you as well if it makes
you feel any better
Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the
awkward dog The dog starts to squeak Tony passes the
blade to Hands
BIT
It s squeaking

HANDS

What youve never heard a dog squeak

before Hold him still
The dog isnt sure about this either Vin is in a panic and
suddenly
VINNY
Stop I can see it I can see the
stone

Hands at the point of entry stops Vinny hops over to the
stone and picks it up Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
grip oh the collar The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated
Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare

HANDS
Well lets see it

Vinny holds it up Theres a sense of relief He then throws
the stone it cuts through the air And the dog seeing
-another projectile runs to intercept it Theres a pause
while all now focus again on the dog This is digested
literally and mentally The dog recognizes all the attention
its receiving And goes through the motions of swallowing
it Hands attempts an approach The dog understandably

feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
emergency action is needed and seeing the open window
launches itself out of it
