Living on the road my friend
was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breaths as hard as kerosene

INT 79 CAMARO - INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 WEST NEAR THE 1
TEXAS BORDERLINE NIGHT °

JIM HALSEY is asleep at the wheel

Lit up by a splash of headlights flooding the front
seat Windshield awash with the twin headlamps of an
eighteen-wheeler rig bearing down on him He has
drifted onto the oncoming lanes EAR-SPLITTING TOOTS
of the trucks HORN shock him awake Shouting he
spins the steering wheel hand over hand swerving wild-
ly onto the right side of the road Head-on collision
missed by inches The titanic tractor trailer THUNDERS
past shuddering the cars suspension in its afterblow
Then it is gone

Soothing country dark thick and tangible as oil flows
into the car again The world outside the windows is
black and empty save for a distant pinpoint of head-
lights ahead and the red and amber warning lights of
the truck receding in the rearview mirror Broken
white lines and blacktop roll out of the darkness in
the Camaros high-beams

Halsey gasps for breath long drags of air to calm
himself down In the white glow of the dashboard
lights Jim is seen to be a 20-year-old young man with
long dirty blond hair and rugged good looks de is
clad in a black leather jacket and a white tee-shirt
He has on blue jeans and Etonic running shoes Halsey
starts to nod off again He blinks and slaps himself
to stay awake

A signpost comets out of the void Welcome to Texas

The kid cheers punching the horn and pounding on the
roof above his head Made it

Droplets begin to fleck the windshield The drizzle
becomes a rainstorm He switches on the windshield
WIPERS and they SLAP away the splashing water THUNDER
CRACKBOOMS A slag of lightning jags across the gloomy
sky

The speedometer needle hovers at 45 mph Jim CLICKS
down his signal stick He checks his blind spot to see
if its safe to change lanes The Interstate is inky
pitch fore and aft Halsey steers his car sideways

HORN BLARE SOUND OF SHEARING METAL Something
rockets past on his left side scraping his door
showering sparks The kid yells out steering veering
his Camaro into the right lane again In his head-
lights the ghostly form of a white Volkswagen bug
hurtles on ahead

1

It has all its lights ominously off and it is swallowed
up in the dark like an egg in ink

His nerves shot he travels on The horizon ahead is
turning a shade of deep blue Dawn imminent

A second shard of lightning silhouettes a HITCHHIKER on
the highwayside in the strobing electrical flash He
resembles a drenched scarecrow Arm out thumb ex-
tended

The kid signals right He glides the Camaro over to
the shoulder of the road and sits waiting RAIN
SPLASHING WIPERS WHAPPING SIGNAL CLICKING ENGINE
HUMMING A TAP on the window of the passenger door
Halsey reaches his hand out to unlock the door It
hovers momentarily hesitant wary He shrugs and
opens the latch

The door swings open and the ROARING DIN OF THE STORM
shatters the silence The Hitcher hustles into the
Seat There is only a brief glimpse of him before he
shuts the door and the inside light goes off He is a
grimly gaunt man in his mid-thirties His bony skele-
tal physique is wrapped in a black rubber raincoat like
a cape He has a coyote face hair close-cropped to
his skull in convict fashion His skin is pallid and
bad A plastic tube is inserted in his neck at the
larynx His vocal cords have been removed and he has
an artificial voice box His eyes are his most
striking feature Pure black and bullet hard brute
force in them He settles in his seat fixing his -
eyeballs on Halsey

Jim shifts into gear and drives back onto the road
The stranger sits silent and still staring

HALSEY
My mother told me never to do this

No response
HALSEY
(continuing)
The names Jim Halsey man

He extends his hand The Hitcher shakes it He SPEAKS
with a VOICE like a TRANSISTOR RADIO

HITCHER
John Ryder

HALSEY
So where do you want me to drop you 1

No answer

HALSEY
(continuing)
You gonna tell me where youre
goin’ or what

No answer Eyeballs glinting in the dark reptilian
alien

HALSEY
(continuing)
What are you looking at me that
way for I said what are you
looking at

RYDER
Scare ya

His bullet eyes are riveted on Jim but Jims attention
has been diverted A white spectre in the watery wind-
shield the Volkswagen bug is parked off to the side of
the road all its lights off

The kid takes his foot off the gas pedal slowing down
alongside the car

Abruptly Ryder places his hand on the kids knee
pressing down firmly forcing the accelerator to the
floor The Camaro lunges on past the other car

HALSEY
Are you stoned or stupid

Ryder just sits and stares at him Jim glances into
the rearview mirror

Out of the backshield the ghostly automotive appari-
tion recedes in the red taillight A popping strobe of
lightning emblazons its windows translucent A swash
of dark liquid drips down the windshield The car
vanishes behind sheets of rain

HALSEY
(continuing)
Why did you stop me from stopping
by that car

No answer

HALSEY
(continuing)
I asked you a question man I
said I asked you a question

RYDER
Scare ya

HALSEY
Gimme a break

RYDER
Scare ya

HALSEY

The rides over

He steers the car over to the embankment and shifts
angrily to park Halsey looks Ryder in the eye

HALSEY
(continuing)
Goodbye

The Hitcher doesnt move a muscle Something about him
is very powerful

HALSEY
(continuing)
Get out

Ryders gaze is very very dangerous The kid holds it
but sweaty fear is setting in Condensation fogs up
the windows The sounds of breathing and heartbeats
Jim drops his eyes Ryder is not going to move and
Halsey knows he cant make him

RYDER
What youre going to do is drive

HALSEY
Oh boy

The kid reluctantly does what he is told The Camaro
glides back onto the Interstate The sky is now blue
and faint dawn light falls on the two men There are
no other cars in sight

HALSEY
(continuing)
What was wrong with that car back
there

RYDER

HALSEY

RYDER

HALSEY
So whats the real story with that
car back there

RYDER
Ran out of gas

HALSEY
So you want to find a gas station

RYDER
It would help

The kid breathes a sigh of relief

RYDER
(continuing)
Gas stations have cigarettes and I
need some smokes

1 1

HALSEY
What about gas

RYDER
I dont need no gas

The kids spirits sink

HALSEY
How are you gonna drive without
gas

RYDER

HALSEY

The Hitcher chuckles

HALSEY
(continuing)

Whats so funny

RYDER
Thats what she said

HALSEY
Who is she

-RYDER

She is the girl that was driving
that car back there Shes the
one who picked me up before you
did

The kid is quivering with fright Squinting through
the windshield he sees a sign whiz by “Pay Toll
12 Mile Ryder has his eyes set on Halsey and
doesnt spot it The kid accelerates

HALSEY
Where is she

RYDER
Im sure shes still back there
She couldnt have walked very far

HALSEY
Whys that

RYDER
Because I cut her legs off And
her arms And her head 1

HALSEY

Wow -
RYDER

And Im going to do the same to

you

Their faces are shined on by the glittering illuminated
tollbooth plaza just a few hundred yards away Four
Highway Patrol cars are parked by the side of the
structure Jim steers out of the exact change lane
towards one of the manned booths

Jim turns his head to stare square in Ryders face He
gathers up a mouthful of saliva and spits it at him

Drool dribbles down the Hitchers cheek He is un-
ruffled as the Camaro eases onto the ramp into the
terminal

The car nestles in next to the window Green lights
flash red Guard gatepost winds down

Ryder cups his hand over Halseys crotch METALLIC
SNAP A switchblade knife is secreted in the palm
The razor edge is laid against the fly of Jims pants
The smile runs away from the kids face

RYDER
Dont

The TOLL ATTENDANT is a tobacco-chewing old geezer He
rolls his eyes as he sees the two men in the car one
with his hand on the others privates Ryder blows him
a smooch The geezer grimaces in disgust flicking his
fingers impatiently

TOLL ATTENDANT
Come on Lets go sweethearts

The kid is pouring sweat Raw desperation He tries
to catch the old mans eye The Toll Attendant wont
acknowledge him aloof

The Hitcher fetches a crumpled greenback from his rain-
coat pocket He squeezes Jims fingers around it

RYDER
Pay the man

Jim starts to offer the bill He holds his breath as
he sees damp splotches of fresh blood smearing the face
of George Washington He might have a hope 1

Just a small one He holds the bill out his window
gozy side up for the Attendant to take

The geezer snatches it and plops it into the cash
drawer without so much as a second glance Jim emits a
choked sob gritting his teeth as Ryder applies a bit
of pressure to the knife against his genitals

RYDER
(continuing)
Drive

“Red lights flash green Guard gatepost winds up

Halsey clamps his eyes tight shut He puts his sneaker
down on the gas pedal and presses it in leg shaking
The Camaro VROOMS out of the tollbooth plaza

The two-lane blacktop ahead is deserted of cars as far
as the eye can see utterly desolate and an inconsol-
ably bleak place to die

The Hitcher rests the razor blade edge of the shiv on
the ridge of Jims eye socket He delicately pricks
the pinpoint tip on the white of his eyeball Tears
stream from the ducts Jim keeps his gaze religiously
fixed on the road

RYDER
(continuing)
Ya wanna know what happens to an
eyeball when it gets punctured
It deflates like a balloon and ali
the goo oozes out

HALSEY
Great

Ryder scrapes the switchblade in a red scratch line
down Halseys cheek and over the jut of his awbone
He indents the point on Jims throbbing jugular vein

RYDER
Ya got any idea how much blood
jets out of a guys neck when his
throats been slit Gallons
Youll be up to your ankles in the stuff

HALSEY
What do you want

RYDER
I want you to stop me 1

HALSEY
You got the knife Youd stick me
with it before I could do anything

RYDER
Thats right I would Im going
to So what do you got to lose
Stop me

HALSEY
I cant

A dark damp stain spreads across the legs of Jims
The Hitcher notices it and goes berserk

RYDER
Ya pissed your pants ya
vegetable Ya think that’s gonna
Save your ass Ya wanna know why
Im gonna gut ya like a fish
Even the lowest of animals got the
survival reflex to fight back when
its life is on the line If ya
aint got that youre like some
jelly amoeba with no backbone or
spine and ya aint fit to live
Im gonna hack you up chop you
apart piece by piece and 1 swear
youre gonna be conscious during

surgery

Jims eyes chance on the speedometer gauge Two illum-
inated words in red

Door Ajar
Face bloated flushed with adrenalin he sucks in air

HALSEY
I dont want to dielll

The kid ramrods his shoulder into Ryders torso The
Hitcher is slammed into the passenger door It springs
open jettisoning him out onto --

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 2

looselimbed over and over and over Flopping like a
limp rag doll onto his belly he recedes away into a
black speck in the --

-- rearview mirror The dot evaporates FROM VIEW

Halsey is spaced out jaw drooping out of it The
road ROARS through the open door He leans over and
yanks it shut Sits up straight

He pats his forearm knee and stomach and feels his
face to assure himself that they are all intact An
astonished expression hits his face He laughs and
cheers hysterically He slaps on the dashboard and
pounds on the aluminum roof and drums on the steering
wheel and punches the horn repeatedly HONK HONK
HONK HONK HONK

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - BACK DOWN THE ROAD - DAY 4

John Ryder is sprawled and splayed akimbo on the muddy
tarmac Fingers scraped raw

Twitch

White eyes pop open in a wild Kabuki mask of a face
War paint streaks cf rainy grime and gore

His body quivers and contracts in wracking stabs of
pain Shaking he rises to his hands and knees A
string of pink drool dribbles from the contorted ori-
fice of his mouth Stooped over he staggers onto his
feet and sways unsure of footing Bent he stumbles
around the blacktop searching for something Locating
it he grabs it up off the ground

The switchblade shiv gets clenched so hard in his fist
his knuckles go white

The Hitcher stands tall and awful on the empty freeway
staring in the direction the kid has fled

His lips pull back in an ear to ear deaths head grin

INT 79 CAMARO - DAY 5

Jim lays back in his seat smoking a cigarette spent
and gloriously happy One hand guides the steering
wheel He wears a beautific expression beholding the
badlands spreading out on all sides of him

Droplets of rain are drying on the windshield so he
turns off the wipers The titanic black storm clouds
are behind him

5

Ahead the great ceiling of sky glows with a silver
light that makes the desert incandescent The sun is
just about to rise and the world shines with a newness
and freshness that suggests someone just took the Saran
Wrap off it

Jims face becomes waxy as his adrenalin high wears off
and he starts to come down Looking chalky and sick
he steers his car over to the gravel shoulder and
shifts to park Urgently he bolts out of his door
onto --

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 6

Wretching and heaving he gets on his knees and chucks
his guts onto the tarmac He catches his breath when
his insides are empty and climbs back into the --

INT 79 CAMARO - DAY 7

He turns over the ignition and rolls back onto the
road Accelerating to speed he shakes his head to
himself

HALSEY
Welcome to Texas

The SOUND of an ENGINE behind him The kid consults
the rearview mirror

A Ford station wagon swells in the oval glass It
flashes its brights alerting its going to pass

Jim watches it out his side window as it goes on ahead
alongside

A middle-aged mother regards him blankly out the pas-
senger window her hair set in pink curlers

The car advances onwards and three children come into
view Faces pressed flat against the glass of the rear
compartment They stick out their tonques shooting at
Jim with plastic pistols and rifles

Halsey chuckles and returns his eyes to the road set-
tling back in his seat The station wagon glides on
ahead sliding over into his lane

The kid jolts bolt upright stricken speechless

7

The scalding visage of John Ryder glares at him through
the back tailgate window shrinking away as the car
picks up speed

Jim leaps into action He flattens the HORN button
BLARING it unremittingly He hits the hi-beams

Halsey smacks the steering wheel

HALSEY
No you stupid shit

gim eranes his neck to scout the oncoming lanes No
cars there as far as the eye can see He wheels the
Camaro over the solid yellow lines to the wrong side of
the road stomping on the gas pedal In seconds he is
racing nose to nose with the station wagon

The driver is the father A stern-faced crew-cutted
man who looks at Jim like hes some kind of nut

The kid leans over to unwind the passenger window As
he does so he inadvertently weaves his car treacher-
ously inward When he sits back up the dad is BEEPING

his HORN and angrily shouting in his direction

The kid hollers words of warning at the top of his
lungs His voice is drowned out by the roar of the
road Frustrated he tries exaggerated physical ges-
tures unaware of how ludicrous they come off

The father responds with a hand signal of his own A
jabbed upraised middle finger With that he gives
his car some gas and the station wagon lunges on ahead

Halsey is undaunted Gritting his teeth he throws the
Camaro into second The eight-cylinder muscle car
easily catches up with the rinky-dink Ford The kid
looks over to see the father miming another hand sig-
nal Forefinger frantically pointing ahead a
frightened look on his face

The BOOMING BLAST of a HORN Jims eyes snap front and
he screams

A trailways bus is rearing up bearing down on him

Jim hand-over-hands the wheel steering his car in a
right angle to the left

The silver cruiser chariots past Too close 7

A jarring SOUND of MASHING METAL The Camaro is struck
on the rear bumper and sledgehammered into a 360 degree
spin-out Halsey hangs onto the steering wheel for
dear life as the view through the windshield becomes a
loonily swirling blur of desert and highway SQUALL of
tortured rubber When everything settles down Jim
opens his eyes to see his car is sitting in the middle
of the Interstate He is breathing in spurts and
sweating all over Behind him the bus has pulled over
to the side of the road Dazed and somewhat incohe-
rent Halsey wipes a trickle of blood away from the
corner of his mouth Shutting his eyes he tries to
settle down

HALSEY
Cool down Down boy Whoa
Cool out

The kid turns on the ignition The Camaro shimmies and
shakes but turns over He puts down the accelerator
The car rolls out into the westerly lanes Hes in
business again

Jim squints up the straightaway Not a trace of the
station wagon to be seen

He puts the pedal to the metal and shifts up to second
The sports car thrusts beneath him He throws the
stick into third The Camaro bucks like a bronco into
high gear

The speedometer climbs steadily 80 85 90 100
110 115 120 125 MPH

A speck appears up ahead The speck becomes a dot
The dot rearranges into the now familiar tailgate of
the Ford station wagon The kid shifts down to first
and lifts his foot off the gas pedal Space closes
He squints through the windshield in suspense The
station wagon is sitting at a standstill in the middle
of the road

Jim slows his speed and steers his car alongside the
stopped station wagon He turns his head to look out
his window at it

The windshield is gruesomely smeared with finger paint
Streaks of bright red blood Halsey turns a whiter
shade of pale He screams and screams again until his
throat is raw and hoarse and only a rasping comes out
He stamps his foot on the accelerator and doesnt stop
He drives on down the road at full-tilt forgetting to
breathe He stares straight ahead not daring to look

EXT GHOST GAS DEPOT - INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 8

A derelict abandoned service and fueling station The
office and garage are bombed out There is a black -
crater in the asphalt where the pumps once stood

The Camaro barrels into the driveway and stops ina
skid Jim leaves the engine running He shambles out
of the car and hurries around the obliterated premises
searching

He walks into the cave cavity of the --

INT GARAGE - DAY 9

Inside all is gutted and blackened by fire A few
melted tires are welded together in a morbid
grotesquely suggestive mass in the corner Dim light
digging in the dirty window shows the shape of a pay
phone wall unit next to the glass panes

Halsey runs over to it He picks up the receiver and
lets out a sigh of relief when get a DIAL TONE Fish-
ing in his jeans for a dime he plugs one into the
slot dialing up 911 He waits tapping his foot

HALSEY
Hello Hello police You gotta
listen to me Im out here about
ten miles past the toll booth on
the Interstate

CRASH

A familiar fist punches through a pane of glass shat-
tering shards A switchblade stabs for his armpit as
Jim wrenches out of the way hollering The hand with
the Shiv entangles itself in the phone cord neatly
snipping it in two A dead line

The kid shuffles back toward the rear of the garage
His hand is clamped onto the severed receiver as he
backs himself into a corner

The opening to the garage is emblazoned by the molten
red fireball of the rising sun erupting over the
desert horizon spewing fiery rivers across the burning
sky

9

The silhouette of John Ryder steps into view framed
against the blazing sunrise As he approaches the-
steel blade glimmers in his hand as if it were red hot

Halsey wallops the burned brick masonry with the phone
receiver in his fist He holds it out threateningly
His muscular young form shakes from head to foot

HALSEY
Cmon

The Hitcher doesnt say a word He takes a few more
steps and stops where he is standing Purposefully he
outstretches his arm There is something in his fist
He revolves his wrist until the palm is downwards He
opens his hand and something metallic and glittery
drops onto the ground with a JINGLE Ryder turns on
his heel and walks back from whence he came disappear-
ing from view as he is swallowed up by the flaming sky

Jim watches him go uncomprehending Venturing over to
the spot on the ground where the object was dropped he
stoops down to retrieve it Halsey rubs it in his
fingers confused

His ring of car keys

The kid trods over to the gateway and sticks his head
out to peer around A stale dry breeze is whisking up
the dust at his feet I11 at ease he steps out onto --

EXT GHOST GAS DEPOT - DAY 10

Outside the little wind is shaping up into a freak
dust storm Grit and dirt are swept up and swirled
into tiny twisters whipping around the lot Jim has to
shield his face with his forearm

Squinting against the blowing scrub he can see the
scarecrow figure of John Ryder standing stone still on
the edge of the highway His black raincoat is flap-
ping around his skeletal frame bony body buffetted by
gusts of tumbleweed sassafras and sand

His hand extends in Jims direction fingers beckoning
compelling Come

The Hitcher becomes obscured behind a haze of desert
debris

Halsey claps his hand over his face and peers through
the space between his fingers

10

The clouds of flying matter die down long enough to
discern the blurry outline of Ryder His hand is still
held out but this time it is toward the road This
time his thumb is extended

The dust storm wreathes him in a brownish smoke screen
of dirt Molten red taillights melt through The
shadow shape of a black pickup truck All at once the
ground is upheaved in a HOWLING HURRICANE of sand and
scrub The truck is erased from view

Halsey takes off in a run in that direction He waves’
his arms and yells but his voice is drowned out in the
DUST STORM DIN He gets nowhere fast His body is
pummelled by the blistering winds and debris

HALSEY
Dont pick that guy up Dont

As quickly as it rose up the TUMULT DIES DOWN The
winds sigh into a breeze and whisper away into still-
ness and an UNCANNY SILENCE Straw dirt tumbleweed
sand and scrub settle into a fine carpet of dust as
visibility returns

The kid wipes off his face with his tee-shirt Dis-
oriented getting his bearings he sees he is standing
alone on the dirty blacktop of Interstate Highway 10
John Ryder and the black pickup truck are gone

Halsey ponders the key ring in his sweaty palm then he
looks up resolutely into the highways middle distance
into the vanishing point

HALSEY
Okay You got it

He sprints over to the Camaro and hops inside The
MOTOR ROARS on and REVS UP in snorts of exhaust It
tears out of the station and onto the westbound freeway
in a SQUEAL of BURNT RUBBER tread marks As it rockets
up the road it disappears from sight in its smokey
wake

The chase is on

INT 79 CAMARO - DAY 11

Halseys features are tight with concentration and
intent as he scouts the onrushing Interstate eyes
scanning left then right fingers wrapped firmly

around the steering wheel He twists his wrist to
uncover his Timex 535 am

il

The world is waking up Morning rush hour traffic
parades by in the opposite lanes A motorcade of
tractor-trailer eighteen-wheelers a yellow school bus
a milk truck a few commuter economy cars on the way to
work somewhere The routine daybreak traffic proces-
sion returns some sense of normalcy and sanity to the
highway that was so psychotically surreal only minutes
before The cars are turning their headlights off

Keeping a sharp lookout Jim uncaps the coffee thermos
he has resting on the dashboard sipping the steaming
liquid

A Marlboro billboard sails by

He grits his teeth in a caffeine rush satisfaction
screwing the cap back on the hot java He checks the
rearview mirror The road behind is as empty as the
one still to come

He lifts the container to place it back on the dash-
board

CAROQQOQQOOOMMMMMPH 1

The Camaro is lambasted from behind The car is rocked
by a shocking seizure that whiplashes Halsey’s forehead
into the steering wheel with terrific force The
thermos leaps out of his hand and douses his lap with
scalding liquid Jim barks in pain jumping in his
seat Recovering his sense quickly enough to regain
control of the car he fires off a glance into the
rearview mirror The back shield is filled with the
front end of the black pickup truck It is suggestive
of a skull with its grinning iron grill and darkened
headlamp sockets A bleached cow skull is rigged on
the hood

Once again it charges into the rear bumper jackhammer-
ing the Camaro The car is violently jarred slipslid-
ing in and out of its lane before regaining traction

The TRUCK THUNDERS up alongside Jim is getting des-
perate by degrees He stomps on the accelerator and
shifts down to gain power and speed as his vehicle
lunges beneath him The pickups ENGINE GROWLS and it
picks up speed It easily resumes its side-by-side
position

Without warning the truck dives in across the white
lines and piledrives itself into the left side of the
Camaro

il

Ll

The drivers door buckles in and Jim is flung -
helplessly into the next seat fingers pried free of
the wheel He clambers back into position but its
too late The car is bounding off the road and all he
can do is step on the brake The Camaro nosedives into
an irrigation ditch coming to rest half in and half
out Lifted at an angle

Halsey grimaces moaning in pain as he cuts the igni-
tion Looking over at the nearby highway he sees the
pickups tail end shrink away in the trailing cloud of
dirt Gone

The kid tenderly touches a welling welt on his fore-
head His brow knits in anger He spits He switches
on the ignition and REVS the eight-cylinder ENGINE
until it ROARS and ROARS Confident his car is intact
he shifts into first The Camaro jounces as it climbs
out of the water channel and back onto the gravel
shoulder

Halsey peers left and right Seeing the Interstate is
clear he accelerates back onto it

A blue road sign whizzes by GAS NEXT EXIT 14
MILE

Jim checks the fuel gauge on the dashboard The needle
pin is into the red shading on the E end

Swearing he taps up the signal stick and slows to
enter the exit ramp Over a small upgrade at the base
of the downgrade by the little intersection he eases
to a halt by the stop sign

A Texaco gas depot is across the way Towering twin
pinions support an illuminated signboard high overhead
A metal drawhorse reading Closed rests on the driveway

Jims eyes stare without blinking his tongue wetting
his lips suddenly gone dry

The black pickup truck is parked at the curb of the lot
inside Very slowly the kid drives his car across the
intersection Climbing his car up on the curb of the
smooth cement paveway of the gas station he parks at
the base of the ramp Shutting off the Camaro he
pockets the keys Unhitching the door he climbs out
onto --

EXT TEXACO SERVICE STATION - DAY 12
Halsey walks around the rear of his car to the trunk

The back fender is bent and dented in and his tail-
lights are smashed Inserting his key he lifts open
the storage compartment A Goodyear radial a lug
wrench and a tire iron lie inside He takes up the
crowbar and swings down the trunk door

Jim wields the iron like a crowbar and hikes up the
asphalt ramp onto the cement paveway The black pickup
truck is parked across from the gas pumps It sits
sheeny as a big beetle in the hot sun

To the left of it is another lot surrounded by a six-
foot-high wood slat fence

The kid takes a few more paces then stops He can see
from where hes standing that the cab of the truck is
empty He gives the station a once over Nothing and
nobody in plain sight He makes his way around to the
rear of the low white office building

Two doors against the wall “Men” “Ladies

The womens restroom door is slightly ajar

Jim brings the tire iron high up over his shoulder and
sidles up against the wall He counts under his breath

He launches off a kick that bursts open the door bust-
ing his way into --

INT LADIES ROOM - TEXACO SERVICE STATION - DAY 13

The kid wheels around with the crowbar poised The
lights are out and the room is empty He nudges the
door to the toilet stall open with the toe of his Pro
Ked Also empty

He shrugs and relaxes

He walks out into --

EXT TEXACO SERVICE STATION - DAY 14

Outside he gets back to business Clenching the tire
iron with one hand he tries the knob to the door of
the mens room with the other It wont budge He
presses his ear flat against the door but can detect
no sound inside

The kid decides to check around front again

14

He goes the other direction this time Turning the
corner of the building he spots the black pickup truck
sitting where it was before About twenty yards from
the slat fence

He cautiously goes over to it Up on his tip toes to
peer into the drivers seat Nobody home Down on his
hands and knees to peek below the chassis No one
hiding beneath He scratches his head An idea comes
to him He walks around front and examines the grill
and front fenders Spotless Not a scratch on it

HALSEY
This aint the same truck

Jim slogs back around the left side Resting his butt
against the rim of the tire he lights up a cigarette

KAB RRRAAAAAASSSSSSHHHHHH

A second black pickup truck explodes through the picket
fence in an eruption of splintering chunks of wood
planking It comes charging straight for the kid like
a rampaging steer A cow skull is rigged on the hood

Halsey comes alive swan-diving through the air out of
the path of the pickup He lands hard on the cement in
a belly roll just as the truck battering-rams its
brother The first pickup is tipped over onto its
side

With a GRINDING SNARL of SHIFTING GEARS the black
pickup TRUCK SCREECHES into reverse and SQUEALS forward
with a SNORT of exhaust

Jim gets to his feet and runs for his life The pickup
rears up behind him like a black bull Jim fakes the
truck out by breaking off to the right and dodging in
between the four gas pumps

The pickup speeds past slamming on its brakes It
does a full turnaround with almost animalistic agility
Spewing out noxious carbon monoxide fumes it barrels
headlong for the pump stalls the kid is climbing
through

BBARRRRAAAAANNNNEKKKKEKK 1

The truck bulldozes into the first row of pumps crump-
ling them into hunks of twisted steel under its tires

Geysering jets of Super Preminium and Regular Unleaded
skyrocket into the air from the underground tanks 14

Jim is caught square in the chest by a flying gas hose
handle and goes toppling onto his back Gasoline rains
down on him dousing him in a spreading pool In
seconds he is drenched with the stuff

The kid starts to scramble to his feet The black
pickup TRUCK ROARS straight for him Jim slips on the
viscous petrol and drops again The truck is on top of
him and it stops with its tire treads touching his
sneaker soles Halsey stares in raw animal terror at
the skull-faced front end of the vehicle looming over
him It sits there for long terrible moments

Finger lakes of petrol flow down the lot and ramp
streaming around the Camaros whitewalls

The drivers window of the black pickup truck rolls
down A familiar blanched bony hand holds out a stick
match between thumb and forefinger It strikes it up
with the thumbnail in a flash of flame The hand holds
the burning match out over the sea of gasoline the kid
is taking a bath in The flickering flame roasts away
the wood stick singeing the flesh of the fingertips

Jim can stand it no longer He leaps to his feet and
bolts in the direction of his parked car sneakers
Splashing through streams of Texaco Plus

The match is dropped
WWWHHHHHHHHOOQOOOOOSSSSSSSHHHHH

A fulgeration of fireclouds The flames blaze a fiery
trail along the oceans of petrol chasing him and
catching up Halsey scatters as fast as his feet will
carry him but the fiery licks are snapping at his
heels If it touches him he will ignite like a human
torch

He arrives at the Camaro in the nick of time diving

headfirst through the open door into the front seat as
the car is immersed in a swamp of burning gasoline

INT 79 CAMARO - DAY 15
Dripping with petrol and perspiration from the intense
heat Jim drags the door closed He jams the keys in

the ignition and takes position behind the wheel

The ENGINE TURNS OVER Throwing the car into gear he
stamps his foot down on the gas pedal

15

The windshield is awash with red and yellow fire Por
a second it is unclear whether the car is even

moving Suddenly the windshield flashes a view of ‘the
Interstate 10 overpass and the intersection beneath
Out of pure reflex Halsey manages to swerve the car
into the right side of the road and hurtle off down

it Home free

He lets out a hysterical howl of glee when he realizes
he has once again survived shifting straight up to
third and putting the pedal to the metal The perspec-
tive of the road ahead seems to flatten as he thunder-
balls down the two-lane strip He is trying to cover
as much ground as he can before the Texaco gas depot
blows sky-high

BBBBAAAAARRRRRROOOOCOOOQOOCOMMMMM

A blinding flash whites-out the world as far as the eye
can see The Camaro is tremored by an earth-shaking
shock wave The deafening EXPLOSION gives way to a
ringing SILENCE

Halsey keeps mumbling words to himself over and over
and over as he drives on and on and on

HALSEY
Its over buddy its over buddy
its over buddy its over buddy
its over

A signpost wings on past FoodRest 12 mile

A “Longhorn Sirloin Burger restaurant approaches
ahead Jim can barely drive anymore He has to keep
his hands glued to the steering wheel He keeps it
together enough to negotiate the simple turn into the

nose when he gets a whiff of himself

Halsey shoulders the strap of his duffel bag and closes
the door of his car He shuffles up the steps to the
restaurant and shambles to the glass doors

A WAITRESS is behind the pane of glass in the process
of unlocking it with a key in her hand The girl is a
pretty plain young woman of 22 with a simple rural
face and strong straight-ahead eyes She is just
pushing open the door as she looks up and sees the
soiled strung-out kid Rolling her eyes she pulls on
the door to shut it Jim catches the handle and holds
it half open as she holds it half closed

The young man and the young woman are having a tug of
war with the door

sympathetically and sets the napkin container on the

this day

Jim has taken a hearty mouthful of his cheeseburger
He stops chewing all of a sudden a puzzled expression
on his face He feels the top of the bun with his
fingertips Halsey lays the burger back down on the
plate and flips the bread lid

The kid chokes on the morsel of food in his mouth and
Starts to gag

A disembodied human eyeball floats gorily glassy on a
bed of gooey cheese

Jim swats the plate off the counter sending it sailing
against the wall and shattering to smithereens
Galveston puts her hands over her mouth shock-stricken
at the spectacle Halsey staggers off the seat and
stumbles around coughing choking to death He jams
the small of his back against one of the stools and
punches himself with both fists in the solar plexus

The bit of food is disgorged from his windpipe

He sits on the floor in a stupor Suddenly he is on
his feet in too much pain and shock to speak as he
flees out the door of the restaurant

The waitress is speechless She gathers herself to-
gether and walks to the window watching the kid
scramble down the staircase

draw out their 357 Magnums from their sideholsters
with practiced liquidity taking two-handed aim at the

look on his face

Halsey does what he is told Putting his hands behind
his head he climbs down onto his knees and flattens
himself face-first on the cement

The Highway Patrolmen hurry over to where he lies

his hand on the sides of the kids leather coat He
sticks his fingers in the pocket and pulls out some-

swerves around and comes to a stop TROOPER PRESTONE
and TROOPER CONNERS get out leaving the MOTOR RUNNING

Jim takes the sound of the doors opening as a cue
Leaping around the pillar onto both feet he trains the
hog pistol on the two Highway Patrolmen

HALSEY
Stop

Trooper Prestone and Trooper Conners obey

Their hands

hover by their hips The guns have not been taken out

of the holsters

TROOPER PRESTONE

Trooper Conners obediently follows Halseys directions
He places his wrists together in the small of his back 33

Trooper Prestone unhitches his cuffs from his belt and
clamps them securely around his brother officers
wrists

HALSEY
Were all gonna get in the car and

TROOPER PRESTONE

Jim walks over to the right hand back door and gestures
with the barrel of the 357 Magnum The subservient
troopers get together by the right front door

HALSEY
One of you open the door

Trooper Prestone gently unlatches the door and eases it

open Halsey opens his with one hand and keeps the gun
leveled with the other

HALSEY (contd)
--- Were all gonna get in at the
same time Ready Steady Go

The three of them climb into the vehicle in unison

INT HIGHWAY PATROL CAR - DAY 34

Trooper Conners slides over and Trooper Prestone gets
behind the wheel Halsey braces his sneakers against
the frame of the front seat Resting his elbows he

keeps a Steady and unwavering two-hand grip on the
cannon

HALSEY
Start the car Head for the
highway

The patrolman switches ON the IGNITION and shifts into
gear

34

He drives out of the parking lot down the dip of the
ramp and turns onto the road

A Motorola shortwave RADIO is under the dashboard The
light is blinking as a wire band frequency is monitored
on the speaker amid storms of STATIC

and rubs his eyes

HALSEY

TROOPER PRESTONE

lips

The two Highway Patrolmen who have been listening to
the conversation exchange flabbergasted glances The
kid grins broadly in relief

HALSEY
Pull the car over to the side of
the road

Trooper Prestone steers the car onto the shoulder and
slows to a stop shutting off the ignition He holds
out his open hand

TROOPER PRESTONE
Guess you better let me have the
gun

The angry SNARL OF AN ENGINE and a SQUEAL OF BRAKING
TIRES The kids and the troopers attention is com-
manded by a VEHICLE that zooms up and sits SNORTING
exhaust alongside the police car

The black pickup truck

Trooper Prestone and Trooper Conners rotate their heads
to peer out the open window at the darkened cab of the
malific truck

HALSEY
Noooocoocoo00 1

CRACKAKABOOQOOOOM CRACKAKABOOOOOQOOOM Muzzle flashes
of PISTOL SHOTS The cops slump like sandbags 34

The black PICKUP THUNDERS off up the freeway leaving
an ugly gray cloud of carbon monoxide-laden smoke and
dirt in its place

Jim has his hands clapped over his ears drowning out
the SOUND OF HIS SCREAMS splitting the RINGING SILENCE

The interior decorating of the squad car consists of a
bright red bloodbath Out of his mind the kid breaks
out the side door onto --

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 35

Shoving the 357 Magnum brutally back into his belt
Jim runs like a lunatic from the scene derangedly
dashing along the roadside as traffic flies by Stub-
bing his toe on a rock he stumbles to his knees chaf-
ing them raw Staying there he turns his dilated eyes
up into the broad expanse of sky

Sliding the gun out of his waist Jim turns it on him-
self Fitting this thumb around the trigger he opens
his mouth and stretches it wide He inserts the silver
barrel so deep it tickles the back of his throat The
muzzle chokes him up before he can fire and he gags
Sagging down he returns the 357 to the inside of his
jacket He raises his head and looks ahead of him

A truckstop diner lies a stones throw away pit
Stop A slapdash painted sign reads Last Food For
Miles

The kid pauses shambles to his feet and stumbles off
in the direction of the restaurant

INT PIT STOP - DAY 36

Jim walks through the revolving door A BELL RINGS
with a DING A counter with stools and a few booths by
the window devoid of customers The PROPRIETOR is
scrubbing the formica countertop with a Bounty towel
Jim schleps over to it drained and defeated

PROPRIETOR
Can I help you
HALSEY
Coffee Somethin’ I dunno

Coffee

36

PROPRIETOR
Its brewing Got a few minutes

HALSEY
Probably not

PROPRIETOR
To go

HALSEY
Bring it to me at one of the
booths If Im still here

PROPRIETOR
You okay kid

HALSEY
Nope

PROPRIETOR

Go on Have a seat

The owner goes into the kitchen The kid is totally
dejected and despondent He flops into a booth by the
window and stares forlornly out the pane glass at the
highway and the relentless procession of cars and
trucks streaking across it Jim rests his elbows on
the table and puts his face in his hands

Somebody slides into the seat across from him The kid
drops his hands

John Ryder is sighting him down with his trademark
bullet eyes His black raincoated shoulders unfurl
like bat wings his unearthly transistor radio voice
makes Jim sink into the seat cushion

RYDER
So how do you like shitsville
stupid

Jim gropes for his gun under his jacket This cant
escape Ryders notice but he takes it in stride

Under the table the CLICK of a HAMMER being COCKED
back on a 357 Magnum Jims face brightens in a de-
mented gloat

HALSEY
You stay sitting right where you
are Dont move or Ill blow your
brains out your ass 36

Ryder rolls his eyes

RYDER
Aint no bullets in that gun
HALSEY
Yeah
RYDER

Yeah oh yeah

The Hitcher sees the doubt written plainly on the boys
features and laughs incredulously

RYDER
(continuing)
Yer so stupid ya never even
checked did ya

HALSEY

So help me Ill blow you in half
RYDER

Squeeze the trigger if ya want
HALSEY

I will
RYDER

Go ‘head

Jim is on the spot He chews his tongue in his cheek
He is in no way capable of that action Under the
table there is a second similar CLICK The Hitchers
face becomes very serious

RYDER
(continuing)
Because you can sure as shit bet
Im gonna squeeze mine

The kid goes an ashen hue

RYDER
(continuing)
--- Bang

Ryder makes the sound of a gunshot and Jim jumps in his
seat Out of reflex he pulls the trigger summoning
only the hollow SNAP OF A HAMMER striking an empty
cylinder Aghast Jim squeezes the trigger again and
again but the gun is indeed empty

5l 36

The kid shrinks away as Ryder leans forward his pale
thin lips whitening into a scar-tissue sneer

Ryder digs into his pocket bringing his hand out with
something in his pallid fist He spits on the tips of
two of his fingers and balances twin copper pennies on
them Stretching his hand across the table he presses
the coins in Halseys eye sockets

Jim just sits there with the pennies on his eyes He
doesnt breathe

Moments pass The silence is so complete that the soft
puft of a container of coffee being set on the table
is deafening The PENNIES drop out of his eyes and
CLATTER around the tabletop

He looks around disoriented The Proprietor is stand-
ing over him with his hands on his hips John Ryder is
nowhere to be seen

PROPRIETOR
That coffees to go because I
dont want you hanging out here
Take it and get going

The owner goes away Phoenix scans the place in vain
for the Hitcher His gaze settles on something left in
front of him on the table

A napkin folded over some objects Two words scribbled
on the tissue Next time

The kid unwraps the napkin and exhales
Twelve 357 ammo cartridges

He scoops them hurriedly into his coat pocket before -
anyone could notice them His attention is suddenly
diverted

Out the window beside him he sees a Trailways bus
parked in the lot Its door opens and a bunch of pass-
engers step out to stretch and get some fresh air
Several of them come inside to fetch food from the
Proprietor Rest stop

Halsey downs his coffee in a single gulp smacking his
lips

HALSEY
Get your ass in gear buddy 36

The kid gets up out of the booth and makes his way past
the passengers at the counter to the door

EXT “PIT STOP PARKING LOT - DAY 37

The bus sits pluming heat waves into the baking noon
air

In the distance down the freeway a flurry of police
activity Sparking red road flares are set on the
blacktop A squadron of highway patrol cars are parked
around the blocd-spattered one Troopers are hauling
the dead bodies out and placing them on the tarmac

One cop is directing traffic

The bus driver waddles to the rear of the cruiser
absorbed in the spectacle down the road

Halsey steals out the door to the diner and sneaks
across the lot up the gangway and into the bus

INT RESTROOM - TRAILWAYS BUS - DAY 38

Uneccupied The door is pushed in and the kid steps
inside closing and locking it behind him

Jim throws some cold water on his face from the basin
Resting his rear end against the sink he dries himself
with a paper towel

Withdrawing the 357 Magnum from his belt he scoops a
handful of the big-bore cartridges from his jacket
pocket Halsey peruses the handgun fingering its
various components and fittings He hasnt a clue
about how to break the cylinder to insert the bullets
Patience nil he works himself into a red-faced frenzy
pawing at the pistol Tricking open the dead bolt by
accident he flips the tumbler out Plugging slugs
into the six holes and slapping shut the chambers he
returns the gun to his belt

Outside the bathroom can be heard the RUSTLING OF PASS-
ENGERS returning to their seats

The john quivers as the MOTOR RUMBLES on directly be-
neath the floor

The kid makes his move undoing the latch lock and
edging open the door

INT SEATING SECTION - TRAILWAYS BUS - DAY 39

Halsey ducks out the door and drops himself into the
aisle seat in the row set against the rest room Jim
settles in the cushion and has himself a smoke He
returns his pack of Marlboros to the pocket of his
leather jacket and looks about spotting the passengers
in the seats around him He hasnt been seen The kid
breathes a sigh of relief

Stiff he stretches his neck and sees someone sitting
in the rear seat row over his shoulder He shakes his
head and smiles

The girl is out of her waitress uniform and clad ina
denim jacket jeans a dungaree shirt and worn cowboy
boots GALVESTON NASH is sitting alone in the window
seat staring absently through the glass the side of
her face to him She has her handbag in her lap

Jim gets out of the aisle seat and slides onto the
cushion across from her Gal is removing a pack of
Merits from her breast pocket As she lights up she
gets her first look at her seat mate A double take

HALSEY
Hi

GAL
You

The girl tries to get up and run at the same time The
kid is wide awake and in action Jack-knifing himself
across the seats he drags her down in a clinch and
wrestles her onto his lap He stuffs his hand in her
mouth to silence her She bites down hard and he has
to stifle a yelp He draws the 357 Magnum from his
belt and holds it in his hand so she can see it She
stops struggling and stares at the gun

HALSEY
Are you gonna stop

Jim takes his hand from her mouth and suckles the red
teeth marks semi-circling the palm He lets her go
She sits up and smooths off her rumpled garments Her
eyes remain riveted on him

GAL
Are you gonna shoot me
HALSEY
Stop worrying about me shooting

you

He sticks the revolver in his belt and closes the flaps
of his jacket over it

HALSEY

(continuing)
ee See Ima kid Im a normal

kid - Im just like you

GAL
A kid with a gun

39

HALSEY
This gun I stole for protection
I havent fired it once It still
has all the bullets in it It
didnt have any bullets in it at
all until five minutes ago

GAL

So you have the bullets to shoot
me if I dont shut up

HALSEY
What are you doing here anyway

GAL
I commute from my job to my town
My stop is coming up next Are

HALSEY
Dont know what Im going to do
with you

GAL

If youre not going to let me go
youre going to shoot me like you
shot all those other people and
if youre going to shoot me Im
going to scream

The kid claps his hand over the girls mouth Seizing
her by the shoulders he hoists her over to him and
holds her face inches from his own

HALSEY
Look in my face Look in it Do
I look like somebody who gets his
rocks off wasting people Is that
what you see

She looks him over a long moment and shakes her head
sincerely Jim Halsey has made contact with somebody
and all the pressure and pain overcome him as he breaks
down and cries He weeps in shuddering sobs
Galveston suddenly sees a severely shaken strung-out
and scared young man and she is shocked He puts his
head on her shoulder She puts her arms around him and
hugs him softly He lays his head on her lap She is
astonished and affected 39

HALSEY
(continuing)
»- It doesnt stop I cant get
any relief I gotta get some
relief

Stunned she strokes his hair soothingly

GAL
I dont know who you are I dont
know whats going on I do know
you didnt shoot anybody You
settle down Its going to be
alright

A big glass portico looms behind the two of them The
highway recedes behind tinted glass The black pickup
truck is keeping steady pursuit hovering like some
relentless and poisonous beetle on the wing

GRIND OF GEARS as the bus shifts to a lower mode slows
its speed steers onto the road shoulder and comes to

a stop

The kid sits up and looks over the headrest out the
glass portico A Highway Patrol car with its party
Lights flashing is bringing up the rear It parks
behind the cruiser and two troopers climb out unsnap-
ping their side holsters The young man sinks down in
the seat with a groan

HALSEY
Its the cops

GAL
What are you gonna do

HALSEY
I gotta give up I got no choice

GAL
Ill go with you Its going to
be alright

HALSEY
Lets go

The two young people get up out of the seat and go down
the aisle The bus driver pistons open the door with
an AIRLOCK RELEASE

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 WEST - DAY 40

The 357 Magnum is chucked out the open door It lands
on the gravel “

TROOPER HAPSCOMB and TROOPER HANCOCK are approaching
the bus They draw out their handguns and wait in
apprehension

Jim Halsey climbs gingerly down the gangway He disem-
barks with his hands clasped behind his head

HALSEY
Im unarmed Im turning myself
in
The kid goes over to the cops calmly and carefully
The Highway Patrolmen point their pistols at him
Trooper Hapscomb reaches for the manacles on his belt

Trooper Hancock gives him a loaded look The policeman
leaves the cuffs on the clip

HALSEY
(continuing)
ee Im giving up but Im not
guilty

TROOPER HANCOCK
You spit on my wrist

Jim looks down at the wrist It is connected to a hand
which is clenching a 357 Magnum snub-nosed aimed at
his abdomen

TROOPER HANCOCK
(continuing)
ee Wipe it off

HALSEY
You can see Im unarmed

TROOPER HANCOCK
Wipe it off

HALSEY
Put the gun in your other hand

TROOPER HANCOCK
Wipe it off

INT SEATING SECTION - TRAILWAYS BUS - DAY 41

Galveston is biting her lip as she leans over the head-
rest of a seat looking out the tinted glass window at
Jim standing with his hands behind his head with the
Troopers on either side

41

A gum-chewing old woman and a little boy with a
knapsack rubberneck in their seats to see the scene
Trooper Hancock sees the spectators and slowly shifts
his position to shield the kid from the sight of the
passengers The girl swears and sprints down the
aisle

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 WEST - DAY 42

The young man swallows as he sees the cop cock back the
hammer of the gun with his thumb The kid understands
the situation He scrambles away and scatters along
the shoulder of the road The Highway Patrolmen drop
to one knee and draw beads on him Their fingers close
on the triggers

A GUNSHOT cuts the air
Halsey cries out and collapses on the blacktop tarmac

Troopers Hapscomb and Hancock stay still and start to
sweat

Galveston is standing outside the door of the bus Her
simple country girl face is flushed with anxiety She
is aiming the 357 Magnum she is holding in her hands
at the backs of the crouched Highway Patrolmen

Gunsmoke drifts from the barrel

GAL
I dont believe you were going to
do what you were going to do
Drop your guns

The policemen set their revolvers on the road

Jim Halsey gets to his feet Sick with anger he
stalks along the roadway to where Trooper Hapscomb and
Trooper Hancock are down on one knee He bends down
and grabs up a 357 Magnum in each fist He points the
guns grimly in the cops faces and grits his teeth as
they flinch and wince

HALSEY
I understand the situation

He is not interfered with as he walks past the Highway
Patrolmen to where the girl is standing holding the
handgun at her side

He heaves the two 357 Magnums over the guard rail
down a slope and into a small creek at the bottom of
the hill He takes the pistol from her grasp and
levels it on the policemen

HALSEY
(continuing)
Get up and get out your
handcuffs Cuff yourselves to the
guard rail

Grudging but obliging the cops disengage the manacles
from their belt clips close a clamp around a wrist and
clamp the other cuff to the guard rail crossbeam

HALSEY
(continuing)
» Chuck the keys

The policemen toss the car keys to the kid He catches
them and puts them in his pocket The Highway Patrol-
men glower at the girl who is growing concerned about
the consequences of her actions

TROOPER HAPSCOMB
Youre in a world of hurt young
lady

GAL
What was I supposed to do I
wasnt going to stand and watch
while you shot him in cold blood

TROOPER HANCOCK
Youre an accessory and youre
going to jail

HALSEY
Shut up asshole

The kid turns to the girl shoving the revolver in his
belt under his jacket

HALSEY
(continuing)
«e Im gonna grab the car and get
out of here You gonna come

GAL
I cant go with you 42

HALSEY
You cant stay here youll get
arrested If you come with me I
can drive you a couple miles and
you can get out and get away

She shuts her eyes and shakes her head at the situa
tion She shrugs and nods The kid takes the girl by
the hand and hurries her over to where the Highway
Patrol Mustang is parked with its doors flung open and
its ENGINE IDLING He helps her into the passenger
seat heads around the hood and hustles into the
drivers seat They slam shut their doors

INT CAB - BLACK PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 43

A skeletal hand sticking out of the sleeve of a black
rubber raincoat stubs out the butt of a Lucky Strike
cigarette in the pallid palm of the other hand It
wraps around the wooden stock of a 357 Magnum jammed
in the belt of the grey pleated trousers Yanking it
out it pulls the pin and flops open the cylinder
Digging into the pants pocket it comes up with two
fresh cartridges Wedging out the charred casings it
pops in the new shells

RYDER
Bitch

The bony hand slaps shut the chambers and spins them
around with a WHIZZ by the heel of the palm Stuffing
the revolver rudely back in the belt it grabs the
dangling key ring and switches on the ignition The
ENGINE SNARLS The hand slams the stick into first
gear

INT STOLEN SQUAD CAR - DAY 44
Jim Halsey turns over the motor The turbo-charged
ENGINE BURSTS on with a BLAST of horsepower The kid
shifts into gear and steers onto the Interstate and

into the midday traffic He looks at the girl sitting
apprehensively alongside him

Jim returns his eyes to the road

see two cherrytops flashing The flowering red flares
blossom brighter The two pursuing police cars get™
closer hot on their tail Gal looks over her
shoulder She looks at Jim distraught He shrugs
weakly

HALSEY
(continuing)
« Sorry

The kid starts to concentrate on his driving and he
stares straight ahead He ignites a Marlboro with the
dashboard lighter

HALSEY
(continuing)
« Buckle your seatbelt

The girls face is tight with tension as she extends
her strap and latches it into the niche

HALSEY
(continuing)
--- Do mine

Frightened and fidgety she reaches over and secures
his belt

Jim shifts straight up to fifth gear A RACING SURGE
OF THE V-8 ENGINE and the supercharged car sears off so
sensationally fast the two occupants suck in their
breath Halsey jockeys his way through the cars He
swoops in and out of traffic soaring from lane to
lane The speedometer needle swivels up to 110 mph
The SIRENS are growing LOUDER

The kid reaches into his jacket and drags out the 357
Magnum He drops it on the dashboard

HALSEY
(continuing)
I dont think Ill be able to
drive and work the gun at the same
time Do you know how to fire a
pistol

GAL
Im not going to shoot anybody

HALSEY
Aim for the tires 44

Two Highway Patrol black and whites blast over the
blacktop behind the backshield Jim angles his head
out the open window At this speed the violence and
velocity of the wind nearly beheads him He looks out
long enough to see one of the police cars take the lead
of its brother advancing on the left

Over the HOWL OF THE WIND can be heard the voice of one
of the Highway Patrolemn METALICALLY STATIC over the
MEGAPHONE

TROOPER (VQO)
We are ordering you to stop If
you ignore this warning you will
be shot down

The kid looks over his shoulder to see the squad car
keeping perfect pace alongside The passenger door is
so close he could reach out and touch it A bald
Trooper is aiming a sawed-off shotgun at point-blank
range resting his elbow on the base of the window for
a brace

Halsey spins the steering wheel hand over hand and
smashes the police car sideways The skinhead Trooper
is slammed into his partner at the wheel Jim watches
as the patrol car goes out of control sideswiping the
aluminum divider and slipsliding around the road It
recovers and resumes its pursuit The second squad car
drifts to the right and comes into alighnment

The THIN BLAST OF A SHOTGUN The backshield is blown
out in a hailstorm of tinted glass granules that hurri-
cane into the front seat Galveston covers her head
and screams

A SECOND BLAST The trunk door flies open peppered
with buckshot

A THIRD BLAST The trunk gate disappears

BRANNNNG It comes crashing down on the hood flopping
over the windshield

HALSEY
I cant see

The wind sweeps the obstruction off 44

The Highway Patrol black and whites fan out approach-
ing one on each side

Jim snatches the 357 Magnum off the dash tossing it
in Gals lap

HALSEY
Use it Were in trouble

Sobbing she rolls down her window Galveston bears the
huge hog pistol in both her slender little hands frig-
id with fear Squinting she points it in the general
direction of the squad car on her right side Shutting
her eyes and wincing she squeezes the trigger

CRACKAKABOOM The handguns potent kick lashes her
back into her seat The shot goes wild

The first police car maneuvers alongside the stolen
one Jim ducks as the bald Trooper FIRES a cloud of
PELLETS The hood is blown clean off in a flash of
sparks A smoke screen of steam enshrouds the wind-
shield Jim wheels his car inwards and sideslams the
attacking auto The other car is smashed into the
metal divider Halsey batters it again and again

THREE SHOTGUN BLASTS in rapid-fire succession from the
right

The rear side window spiderwebs

The back fender drops away

The roof curls like a sardine can

Goosed Galveston grits her teeth and sticks the 357
Magnum out the window again She squeezes off five
slugs in quick sequence KABOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
BOOM

The police car keeps coming not even fazed

The wind blows the pistol out of her hands

GAL
I dropped the gun

HALSEY
You what

The twin black and whites close in for the kill sand-
wiching the commandeered cop car on both sides 44

The girl looks over white with fright to see a blond
Trooper struggling to aim his shotgun over his part-
ners hands on the wheel The kid turns his head to
face the car beside him He looks up the smoking bar-
rel of a loaded 410

SHOTGUN BLAST Muzzle flash

The buckshot shears Jims door off at the hinges It
falls away Halseys exposed body is whiplashed by the
ROARING WINDS

The Highway Patrol car on the right edges up and the
blond Trooper locks them in his sights The Highway
Patrol car on the left holds its position The bald
Trooper draws a bead on Jims unshielded and vulnerable
figure

The kid flattens the brake pedal TRANSMISSION SHRIEK

and the SCREECH of shorn-off TIRE RUBBER Jim and Gal

are tossed forward like rag dolls The seat belts snap
tension saving them from being catapulted through the

windshield

The twin black and whites open FIRE on a car that was
in between them but suddenly isnt The autos are both
on the receiving end of each others iead shot The
storm of pellets peppers their front tires ripping
them to rubber ribbons Both cars suddenly ride on raw
rims and spin out of control

The police car on the right careens over the embankment
and becomes airborne It nosedives onto the hillside
and rolls top over tail down the slope

The police car on the left crashes into the divider and
flips onto the broken white lines in the center of the

blacktop Steaming emission from under the overturned

and crumpled hood

The stolen squad car sits stationary a ruined wreck
The kid and the girl lie back gasping

HALSEY
Are you okay

GAL
Yeah Yeah

HALSEY

Good 44

They look at each other with anxious alarm at the
wreckage they have wrought The kid reaches to the
dangling key ring and switches on the ignition The
FNGINE CHOKES It COUGHS It CHOKES again then it
SPUTTERS on He shifts to first and gently gives the
car some gas The vehicle shudders forward shakily

The two people roll to the scene of the smashup Gas
glass and mashed mangled metal litter the blacktop
Jim and Galveston have lumps in their throats as they
chance a glance over the embankment at the patrol car
set on its side on the slope The two Troopers are
alive and in shock stunned and stumbling along the
hillside

The kid and the girl breathe a sigh of relief and turn
to look at the overturned squad car The bald Trooper
clambers out He drags his partner grimacing and
glaring at the boy too weak and wounded to do anything
about it

Galveston applies a shear strip to a gash on Jims brow
from a box of Band-Aids in the glove compartment
Halsey shrugs apologetically at the Trooper grabs the
canister and chucks it to him The cop catches the
Band-Aids and pitches a surly stare in return The kid
gives the stolen squad car some gas and the auto starts
covering ground

Halsey pumps the gas pedal and floors it The savaged
car shivers and shimmies It is not well It is
having trouble maintaining a steady speed of 40 MPH

Gal looks over her shoulder She puts her face in her
hands and starts weeping Jim checks the rearview
mirror Reflected are a sea of sparkling red and white
pinpoints of light An armada of Highway Patrol cars
are approaching in the distance

The kid pounds on the gas pedal and punches the
steering wheel in frustration

HALSEY
Cmon Go Go

Something appears in the sky up ahead Jim snaps to
attention when he sees it A black dot A Bell Jet
chopper with the insignia of the Texas Rangers on the
side A little flash

PTAAAAAAAANK A fist-sized hole is punched in the
carburetor

A second flash 44

CRRRRAAAASHHH A windshield cobwebs The crater is
carved out of the vinyl upholstery an inch from Jims
ear He cries out

CRRRRAAAANNNNKSSSSSHHNK A third SHOT blows the
windshield to smithereens The 3006 shell RICOCHETS
around the interior of the car Galveston puts her
arms over her head and screams

Halsey looks over his shoulder to see the platoon of
patrol cars rising on the road to his rear in a flare
of slashing red light He looks through the smashed
windshield to see the black hornet of a helicopter dip
its gleaming glass dome of a nose and divebomb his
car dim reaches his hand over and pushes Gals head
down as he ducks

KAPOW KAPOW The headrests of the two front seats
explode in showers of stuffing A shadow crosses the
interior of the car as the chopper speeds over the roof
in a BUZZSAW of ROTOR BLADES Halsey sits up in the
seat staring all around him The helicopter is no-
where to be seen but the ROARING WHIRR of its ROTORS
is all over the place Whiplashing WINDS assault the
two people inside the car Jim has his hand on
Galvestons head and holds it there

HALSEY
Stay down

The kid looks into the rearview mirror to see the
shiny steely windshield dome of the helicopter
reflected as it lowers itself into position behind the
car A firecracker flash

The rearview mirror is obliterated in sharp splinters
of glass by a slug

The kid looks over his shoulder to see that the chopper
is out of sight The ROTOR ROAR rips the air A
RIFLESHOT shears through the metal roof of the car like
a spike Jim jumps out of the way as the parking brake
between the seats is blown to bits Halseys eyes come
out of his head as he sees the helicopter swoop sink
and settle alongside the car the landing struts sev-
eral feet away from the window The glint of sunlight
on the co-pilots gunbarrel

The kid jam himself back in his seat and spins the
steering wheel swishing his car sideways The roof of
the automobile strikes the struts of the chopper and
sends the aircraft into a WHIRRING WHIZZING spinout 44

The helicopter weaves and wobbles and slipslides across
the sky as it tries to stay airborne It swings up in
front of the automobile and tilts its nose down
angling its propellers to gain altitude and to batter
the two people inside the car with the wind from the
rotor blades

Amid the chaos the familiar SNORT of a familiar EN-
GINE The black pickup truck lumbers up alongside

The Hitchers hand extends out the drivers window a
-357 Magnum clenched in his fist The kid cowers The
gun is not pointed in his direction It targets the
bird of prey helicopter Six GUNSHOTS RING OUT as
Ryder pumps a pistol load into the aircraft

The truck hurtles on and disappears

Jim squints through the shattered windshield his hair
and clothes blown about by the RUSHING WIND Loud and
clear are the SOUNDS OF A HELICOPTER IN DISTRESS
Halsey sees the chopper zig-zagging across the sky
smoke funneling out of its rear rotor It goes into a
tailspin

The kid looks over his shoulder to see the cavalry of
cop cars closing in a quarter-mile behind As he
watches the HELICOPTER CRASHES on the center of the
highway It EXPLODES in boiling balls of fire and
billowing clouds of smoke Fiery debris rains down
No police cars are about to drive through the inferno

HALSEY
Gal We got away

Galveston has her face in her hands shivering in shock 44

Flaming licks and smoking sparks shoot out of the rav-
aged engine Anxiously Jim swerves the car to the
shoulder of the road and stops He throws on the emer-
gency brake and unbuckles his seat belt

HALSEY

door frame onto --

He hurries around the other side and heaves open her
door Unlatching her strap he hauls the limp young
lady out of her seat Heaping her against him he
helps her up the highway side

The bullet-ridden and burning BLACK AND WHITE BLOWS SKY
HIGH in a pillar of fire and smoke

He walks with her along the roadside A regulation

high pinions advertising Shell Exxon Texaco

of strength

The SOUND OF A KEY TURNING IN THE LOCK The door opens
The kid stumbles in with the girl holding her up with
an arm around her waist He drops her on the bed and
she lies there in a heap He shuts the door and locks
it with the key Barely able to stand on his feet he
slides his leather jacket off his shoulders and slings
it over the teievision console The remote switcher is
knocked onto the carpet He collapses on the mattress

Jim and Galveston are sound asleep in seconds

INT MOTEL ROOM 13 - NIGHT (LATER) 48

THROUGH THE CURTAINS out of the window the illumi-
nated gas station signs beam brightly in the blackness
of the night A table lamp on a bedstand casts the two
sleeping bodies on the bed in a warm and cozy glow

The kid stirs in his slumber Still asleep he rolis
over and puts an arm around the girls shoulders She
doesnt awaken but she responds to his warmth and curls
up against him He pulls her close and she clings to
his back with her hands The two fit together like a
soft glove and in sleep seek relief in the sanctuary
of each others bodies Snoozing their faces touch
their lips brush and they breathe each others breath

Jim and Galveston gently kiss She touches her fingers
to the back of his neck and runs her hands down his
shoulders He caresses her bosom beneath her clothes
He works open the buttons of her dungaree shirt Her
breasts jiggle free He squeezes them and suckles her
nipples She sighs and her smile seems to wipe the
anxiety off her face She rummages her fingers through
his hair as his hand ventures down her belly to the
snap of her blue jeans SNAP He ZIPS down her fly
and insinuates his fingers in under her panties at the
crotch She rolls her head from side to side She
takes hold of his hand softly and gently removes it
from between her legs He looks up into her face and
smiles She smiles back

The kid pulls his perspiration-stained undershirt over
his head and slam-dunks it into the waste bin He
reaches behind the curtain into the shower stall and
turns the hot water knob Steaming jets of water blast
out The NOISE is deafening The room begins to fog
up Jim wets his hands and splashes his face and chest

He pokes his head out into the doorway into --

INT MOTEL ROOM 13 - NIGHT 50
The front door is wide open

John Ryder has Galvestons head jerked back at an un-
natural angle by a handful of her hair His switch-
blade knife is laid against her throat She is too
scared to scream

Halsey cries out and jumps into the room

Ryder resembles the Grim Reaper in his black raincoat
and skeleton shape as he rears up over the struggling
girl he restrains so brutally His coyote face is
grimly set and his bullet eyes are afire with psycho-
sis

His forearm muscles flex to cut Gals head off

Jims gaze chances on the television remote switcher on
the carpet by his foot He injects the power button
with his big toe

The Sony Trinitron 24-Inch Diagonal flashes ON at FULL
VOLUME behind Ryder

Jolted Ryder glances over his shoulder for a eritical
instant

The kid dives over the bed and tackles the psycho
dragging him to the floor

Halsey seizes Ryder by the throat and smashes his head
through the glass screen of the television console
The SET IMPLODES in a FLASHBULB POP ELECTRIC CRACK-
LING BUZZ as SPARKS SIZZLE out the back of the unit
Ryder shrieks and screams as his face is fried with
high-voltage electricity His body spasms spastically
in Jims firm and merciless grip The kid yanks
Ryders head out of the gaping hole in the TV and drops
him on the carpet

Ryders face is charred and crisped Transistors and
chinks of glass confetti his cheeks and his hair is
burned off his scalp in spots Blood dribbles out the
corner of his mouth A bubble pops on his lips Res-
piration

HALSEY
I got you

Jim cracks the knuckles of his fists He sees the 357
Magnum in Ryders belt strap in a gleam of chromium
steel He bends down and extracts it To be sure he
opens the cylinder with practiced ease and checks to
see if its loaded Six copper cartridge casings
Halsey spins it shut He picks up the switchblade and
pockets it

Jim looks at Galveston She is crammed in the corner
of the room with her arms covering her bare bosom
watching him wide-eyed He puts the revolver in his
belt and puts out his arms to her

HALSEY
(continuing)
Come here

Galveston starts to sob She runs into Jims arms and
he embraces her hugging her hard She has her head on
his shoulder and he has tears in his eyes

HALSEY
(continuing)
« Its all over Were gonna be
alright Im gonna turn his ass
into the police and its all gonna
get sorted out I gotta call the
cops

The kid strokes the girls hair He walks to the tele-
phone on the dresser and picks up the receiver He
gets an outside line and dials 911 50

Gal sits down on the bed and looks at the skeletal
scarecrow of John Ryder sprawled on the carpet his-
scorched head steaming She shakes her head staring
at him like she would at some strange animal who has
been subdued and is safe to see Jim gets the police
on the line

The kid hangs up the phone

HALSEY
(continuing)
Theyll be here in a few minutes

Jim runs his hands through his hair He squints at the
outside lock latch of the open door Something is
stuck in the tumbler Halsey walks over to the door
and pries out a prong resembling a serrated file A
jimmie pick He looks it over and slips it in the side
of his right sneaker

Jim checks his watch and crosses the room Halsey gets
down on one knee beside the body of John Ryder on the
floor He draws out the 357 Magnum and looks over the
maimed man leaning in a little too close

HALSEY
(continuing)
«e Is he still alive

The Hitchers fist pistons a punch into the kids
throat Jims eyes go out of focus and he drools
dazed and dizzy The psycho claps his hands on
Halsey’s ears with eardrum-bursting force The young
mans eyes roll up in their sockets and the pistol
drops out of his hand He wilts like a limp rag doll
onto the carpet 50

John Ryder rises to a sitting position stuffing the
gun in his belt He shoots a searing stare at
Galveston in a state of shock on the bed The girl
Screams and runs for the open door The Hitcher has
the speed of a spectral spirit as he soars to his feet
and slams his back against the door shutting it sound-
ly He rips the 357 Magnum from his belt and holds it
at his hips on Galveston An overturned table lamp
sheds his skeletal silhouette up the wall and across
the ceiling his black raincoated shadow like a gigan-
tic bat folding the girl in its wings

RYDER
Back bitch

Galvestons pupils are dilated with fear as she shrinks
from him step by step She has her hands on her mouth
as she stuffs herself in the corner of the room

The Hitcher advances several steps and stands over the
out-cold body of the kid slumped on the floor He
stares down at the boy the scorched skin on his face
smoking his eyes burning with psychosis He seems in
a state of severe anxiety splitting apart at the
seams his finger rubbing a slick sheen of sweat on the
trigger of the pistol in his hand

John Ryder turns his head like a gun turret to regard

the girl squeezed in the corner shuddering scared
spitless Something stirs in his eyes

The black pickup trucks sheeny metallic finish glints
in the ink and oil night Its ENGINE is PERCOLATING

Red taillights like smouldering coals shed a sinister
light on Galveston

The girls hands are cuffed together at the wrist and
cuffed to the rear bumper Her feet are cuffed to-
gether at the ankles and cuffed to a heavy iron pole
lodged in the cement The tension on her body is tor-
tuously taut between the two braces Her limbs are
stretched in their sockets Her dungaree shirt is
stuffed in her mouth to smother her screams

Jim stands like a statue

He can see through the back window of the cab of the
truck Reflected in the rearview mirror cast in the
ghoulish green glow of the dashboard lights are the
Hitchers eyes Two bullets drilling into his skull

The passenger door of the cab is pushed open with a

The Hitchers transistor radio voice is garbled and
gurgling from the blood in his throat

The kid just sits there paralyzed with fear

Ryder nudges with his jaw to indicate the chromium 357
Magnum resting on the dashboard in between them

RYDER
(continuing)
« Its loaded up Go for it

Go head Maybe youll be
able to put a bullet in me before

Halsey shudders at the thought His teeth start to
chatter He makes no move for the gun

Youre thinking even if I grab
the gun and shoot him before he
pushes down the gas pedal his
foot will still come off the brake
and the truck will roll a foot
before I can press it down again
Aint that what youre thinking

pimpled and wet with sweat his face is soaked with
perspiration Hes got the shakes

Jims forefinger rubs on the trigger but he cant seem
to squeeze it His body is as rigid as a rock His
systems have shut down The scarifying situation has
set him in rigor mortis

Ryders mouth deforms into a disgusted grimace He
opens his hand and pries the 357 Magnum from Halseys
grasp He holds the revolver by the barrel with the
handle out wielding it like a hammer

He searches the police commanders face for an answer
in all forgetfulness A look of suffering in the mans
world-weary eyes suggests that for ali hes seen and
been through he would rather not go into details

Remembrance returns to Halsey like a set of molar and
incisor teeth chewing on his brain His body convulses
and contracts He lets out a scream of such raw horror
and revulsion the police and justice men screw up their
faces in pain and sympathy and the nurse covers her
ears The Texas Ranger bears himself up and seizes the

gunmetal grey armoured iron-clad prison bus parked by
the door to the prison quadrant of the building The
transport carrier is like a fortress on wheels The
windows are cages bars and steel slits on them The
massive menacing vehicle is sitting with its ENGINE
RUMBLING exhaust puffing out of its pipe

The bolted pole-locked door to the cellblock sector is
opened and five guards with riot helmets step outside
into the morning air They assume sentry position
against the wall with shotguns in their hands

Four policemen with rifles walk out in single file
The Hitcher in black raincoat his wrists cuffed and
padlocked to the chain on his waist is sandwiched
between them The kid is watching him like a hawk

The driver pistons open the hydraulic rear door of the
bus John Ryder is walked up to the stairwell leading
into a solitary steel cell in the back compartment of
the transport carrier He stands still and turns his
head to look at Jim Halsey standing thirty feet away on
the sidewalk °

The kid and the Hitcher lock eyes The young man
winks The psychopath squints

John Ryder gets a gun barrel in the small of his

back He has a small smile on his face as he climbs up
the steps of the stairwell into the steel cell

alone The driver secures the door behind him and
shuts the lock with a key in his hand He walks around
to the cab and hoists himself inside The ENGINE
GRINDS into gear and the ten-ton prison bus rolls out
in a HISS OF AIR BRAKES

Jim Halsey and Captain Eszterhas watch the tank-like
bus lurch onto the acess road The grey iron transport
vehicle with the bars and slots on the windows lumbers
out onto the freeway It drives into the distance and
disappears in the dust settling in its wake

The police commander pats the young man on the shoul-
der He walks him across the parking lot towards a
Texas Ranger car with a Captains insignia on the side
The cop hands the kid a subpoena pamphlet from the
state courthouse Jim reads it absently while he
walks 63

Captain Eszterhas unlocks Halseys door walking around
the hood of the car to unlatch his own The Texas

Ranger commander stuffs his hefty bulk behind the wheel
ane sticks the keys in the ignition Jim climbs down

INT TEXAS RANGER CAR - NIGHT 64

The kid settles into his seat as Captain Eszterhas
SWITCHES ON THE ENGINE shifts into gear and steers out
of the lot onto the access ramp The young mans fea-
tures look haggard battered and haunted in the early
traces of morning light The police commander drives
the car onto the freeway in the opposite direction of
the departing bus

HALSEY
Where are we going

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS

Yes I guess I do His trial is
set for two weeks from today
Youll be the star witness and
your testimony should serve to get
him committed to a high-security
Sanitarium for the rest of his
life

64

The kid looks out the window seemingly sleepy but
secretly awake and aware He is winding up as he
watches the tundra and brush blur by on the side of the
road His face registers a Richter scale reading on
the inner disturbance in his guts and intestines

HALSEY
You know you wont be able to keep
him in prison You know hell
break out You know hell get
loose

The Texas Ranger commander turns his head to look at he
kid and his eyes are soldered steel

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
You listen and you listen good

know what it is and I dont know
if I want to know I dont like
it And Ill warn you The
psycho is in the hands of the
authorities and whatever happens
to him will be decided by the
judicial process It doesnt have
anything to do with you

Halsey shrugs his shoulders and stares straight ahead
his mind working

HALSEY
You got a cigarette on you

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
Sure

The cop looks down at his breast pocket reaching to
remove his pack Jim snakes out his hand and snatches
the Colt 45 out of the police commanders sideholster
aiming it in a two-hand grip at the mans head
Captain Eszterhas is too slow to stop him Halsey
speaks in a soft whisper

HALSEY
Stop the car

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
Youre not going to use that 64

HALSEY
I cant say for sure that I wont
shoot you if you dont do what I
say Stop the car and dont do
anything stupid

The Texas Rangers eyes are iron He sees the kid is
talking straight So he slows down and steers onto the
road shoulder shutting off the ignition and putting on
the parking brake

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
What do you have in mind

HALSEY
Im going to have to ask you to
get out of the car

The police commander sits with his hands on the wheel
looking hard at the kid pointing the pistol in his
face

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
Youre going to get killed If
you dont die youll be
imprisoned

HALSEY
Im sorry sir I really am
Its something I gotta do

CAPTAIN ESZTERHAS
You dont know what youre doing

HALSEY
Well see

The cop shakes his head and sighs He opens the door
latch and climbs out onto the roadside

The kid slams the door shut jams the gun in his belt
positions himself behind the wheel and stomps on the

gas pedal He steers the car in a speeding SCREECHING
TIRE “U turn and rockets the car back up the road

EXT ROAD SHOULDER - INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 EAST - DAY 65

Captain Eszterhas stands in the smokey smog of dust and
dirt swirled up by the rapidly receding car

65

The Texas Ranger commander squints down the road at the
shrinking speck of the ‘car He swears and throws his
Stetson hat on the blacktop and broken white lines He
runs his hand through his hair his face registering
the realization that what is going to happen is out of
his hands As he stands in the desert stillness an
acceptance of the situation appears on his features

Captain Eszterhas sighs wearily and picks up his hat
He holds it weakly at his side and surveys his sur-
roundings Hes in the middle of nowhere The cop
shakes his head shrugs and sticks out his thumb

INT TEXAS RANGER CAR - DAY 66

Dawn is coming on like a freight train Jim Halsey is
sitting in the seat his hands squarely on the steering
wheel his sneaker stamped on the accelerator The
speedometer needle is climbing past 100 MPH The car
shivers and shakes rocked by the wind raging through
the open window

The kid brushes the hair from his face and gets a grip
on the Colt 45 thrust in his belt He draws it out
gritting his teeth and grinning as he sees something up
ahead on the road through the windshield

The gunmetal grey armored prison transport carrier is a
quarter of a mile away the iron-clad rear tailgate
curtained in a cloud of dust

Jim shifts gears and slows his speed decelerating to
take position behind the back end of the bus He BEEPS
his horn The vehicle HONKS its KLAXON in
acknowledgement Halsey ejects the clip of the gun in
his hand to see there is a full load of 45 calibre
shells He injects the magazine back into the pistol
and lights a cigarette puffing smoke

EXT PRISON BUS - DAY 67

The rear door of the back compartment of the transport
carrier BURSTS OPEN in the rushing air

The Hitcher appears like a black bat in the doorway
his handcuffs hanging open on his wrists his hair and
raincoat flapping furiously in the whipping wind

67

His black bullet eyes are bloodshot in his scarred
skull of a face as he stares at the Texas Ranger car
ten yards behind the bus below him The prong of the
lock pick is stuck in the inside tumbler of the door

INT TEXAS RANGER CAR - DAY 68

Jim Halsey stares in stunned awe at the skeletal scare-
crow standing in the doorway of the bus several yards
in front of him The kid snaps out of it snarls and
raises his Colt 45 attempting to aim a shot through
the windshield

John Ryder sees him and his stitched face smiles like
an open wound He propels himself off the back of the
bus and plunges through space His body strikes the
windshield of the car and shatters it to smithereens as
he slumps into the front seat in sprinkling showers of
splintered glass The kid screams and spins the steer-
ing wheel hand over hand swerving the car ina
SCREECHING TIRE arc around the slowing prison transport
carrier in front of him The pistol drops onto the
floor by his feet

The Hitcher sits up in the seat in a sea of blood and
broken glass He snatches the sawed-off shotgun from
the dashboard rack

The stitches on his scarred ripped-to-ribbons face
hang in tattered strings and a single bloodshot black
bullet eye stares down the sight of the shotgun he
levels on the side of Halseys head His finger is on
the trigger

RYDER
Hi kid

Jim braces himself and stomps his foot on the brake
pedal

The Texas Ranger car slams to a stop Halseys head is
whiplashed against the steering wheel with stunning

force Ryder shrieks as he is catapulted over the
dashboard and out the smashed windscreen onto --

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 WEST - DAY 69

The Hitcher is steamshoveled onto the blacktop tarmac
and broken white lines with a sickening sound

69

His shotgun spins away on the road The psychotic is
sprawled and splayed on the hot tar in the rising
rippling waves of heat

The Texas Ranger car sits stationary a short distance
away chunks of stripped smoking rubber on the road
near the skinned tires Steam wafts up from under the
hood

John Ryder stirs He rises to his hands and knees his
fingers stamping bloody handprints on the white lines
of the road In a spaced-out stupor he stumbles to
his feet and staggers towards the sawed-off shotgun
sitting in the dirt on the road shoulder

INT TEXAS RANGER CAR - DAY 70

The kid lies back in his seat squinting through the
windshield to see the skeletal scarecrow silhouette of
The Hitcher reaching for his weapon through the wispy
steam spewing out of the hood

Jim shakes the sand out of his head and shiveringly
picks up the Colt 45 lying at his feet He gets a
good grip on the weapon and rests his wrist against the
Steering wheel His eyes refuse to focus as he settles
his aim on the shadow in the smoke screen of steam

His finger finds the trigger The silhouette shape
raises its shotgun to its shoulder

Halsey screams his lungs out and squeezes the trigger
again and again using up all the slugs The FIERY
WOOSHES of flame spitting out of the barrel burn away
the steam Jim is smashed back in his seat by the
recoil He sits and stares silently at the sight of
John Ryder staggering spastically around the roadway
ruptured rips in his shirt where several shots have
struck him

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 71

The sun beats down on the back of The Hitcher as he
stumbles across the blacktop and broken white lines
The kid watches him breathlessly through the windshield
of the stalled-out car as he shuffles to a stop and
Stands straight with the sawed-off shotgun held in both
hands His bloodshot eyes are both blurry and clear
His body is riddled with bullets but some sick spirit
inside him refuses to die he is staying alive by sheer
psychosis

71

John Ryder raises the shotgun and rests the wooden
stock against his abdomen aiming from the waist and
swivoting his hips to point the weapon at Jim Halsey
sitting in the automobile He has a ghoulish grin on
his face

The kids eyes widen and he switches on the ignition
The car ENGINE ROARS on The Hitcher snarls and FIRES
the sawed-off shotgun shooting a cartridge and shear-
ing a hole through the grillwork of the hood of the
car shattering a headlight in a shower of sparks and
glass The MOTOR SPUTTERS and STALLS smashed by the
shotgun blast

INT TEXAS RANGER CAR - DAY 72

Jims face is flushed with adrenalin as he sees Ryder
recover from the recoil of the shot and revolve at the
waist to aim the weapon at Halsey through the wind-
screen The kid grits his teeth and twists the keys in
the ignition pumping the gas pedal for all he is
worth

The ENGINE WHINNIES and WHINES Its not working

Jim ducks down and covers his head with his arms as the
psycho COCKS the sawed-off shotgun and SHOOTS a round
of shot that splinters a section off the steering wheel
and smashes a hole in the stuffing of the seat Halsey
is sitting in The kid rises up straight to see The
Hitcher walking towards the car on the road COCKING
the gun and aiming it with the butt resting against his
waist a skeletal grin on his skull face Jim shrieks
and winds the key ring in the ignition slot summoning
a SCRATCHY SQUEALING from the ravaged ENGINE

John Ryders eyes shine as he laps his chapped lips and
FIRES the sawed-off shotgun in a licking tongue of
flame Halsey drops into the passenger seat as the
headrest is blasted to bits and the backshield is blown
out The kid sucks in air and sits up in his seat
staring straight into The Hitchers eyes as the psycho
stops walking and stands twenty feet from the car
COCKING the shotgun and aiming it with one arm at the
automobile

Jim crosses his fingers Halsey SWITCHES on the igni-
tion and slams the stick shift into gear stomping on
the accelerator

The MOTOR RAGES on The Texas Ranger car RIPROARS up
the road in a SCREAM of TIRES

72

For a single split second the eyes of the kid meet the
eyes of The Hitcher as the shadow of the advancing
automobile fails over his face and the ROAR of the™
ENGINE fills his ears A relieved smile spreads across
the psychos mouth

The bumper of the speeding car surges into the skeletal
scarecrow shape of John Ryder striking him in the
stomach at 40 MPH

Sim shouts in satisfaction as the automobile bumps
underneath him as it rolls over the bony body beneath
the wheels Halsey stares straight ahead as he steers
the car a few more feet and switches off the ignition
putting on the parking brake The kid shoves open the
door shouldering out onto --

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 10 - DAY 73

Jim stands on the hot tarmac in the wet waves of heat
He is a sizzling silhovette against the searing fire-
ball of the rising sun in the settling dust

He lights a cigarette and walks along the bloody tire
tread marks on the blacktop and broken white lines to
the remains cf John Ryder He stands and stares down
at it testing it with the toe of his sneaker

The Hitcher is definitely dead No doubt about it

The kid heaves the Colt 45 in his hand into the desert
as far as he can throw it

The SOUND OF SIRENS shatters the gesert silence Jim
looks up the road to see scintillating red sparkles

He walks back to the smoking steaming automobile

Halsey climbs up on the hood and sits on it awaiting
the arrival of the authorities

He smokes his cigarette in the sunlight of the day

FADE OUT
