FADE IN
INT DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT

JACOB JOHNSON is sleeping It doesnt look like a pleasant
experience He is sixteen dirty blonde his eyes visibly
moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in
his window seat The lights are dim -- the shade on the
window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead
The HUMMING of the jets engines vibrates through the cabin

The boys eyes snap open

Jacob glances around nervously He looks like an escaped
convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemens
Ball A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the
teenager a cursory glance then goes back to his book Jacob
lays his head back and tries to relax The engines continue
to drone

Until a new noise starts A WHOOSHING NOISE

The sound is very faint But distinct from everything else
Jacob frowns

The noise gets LOUDER Jacobs sure hes hearing it now He
looks at the Greyhaired Man The man catches his eye and the
two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob
turns away The Man returns to his book And Jacob
immediately turns back to him

JACOB
Do you hear that

The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets
louder

GREYHAIRED MAN
Hear what

JACOB
That noise

GREYHAIRED MAN
I dont hear anything

The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER -
- like its coming closer Jacob squirms in his seat --
sneaks a look at the man again How can he not hear that A
STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention

JACOB
Excuse me

STEWARDESS
Yes
The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now The greyhaired man
tries to ignore the two people talking over him

JACOB
What is that sound

STEWARDESS
Thats just the engines sir

JACOB
No its different Its not the
engines Its getting louder

The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly

STEWARDESS
Were just gaining altitude to get above
some rough weather Thats the sound of
the engines speeding up a bit
Everythings fine

JACOB
Umokay

The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to
bite his nails The whooshing is really starting to BLARE
now He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists
around to look behind He snaps back to the greyhaired man

JACOB (contd)
Cant you hear that

GREYHAIRED MAN
(losing patience)
Look kid Will you relax Its just
the damn engines okay

The man glares at him and Jacob backs off The sound has
grown DEAFENING Jacob grinds his seat like hes going mad
He looks at the closed window He reaches out his hand
grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see

A 747 coming RIGHT AT US

Jacob SCREAMS The planes CRASH

Impact - decompression - explosion The hull of the cabin
buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling
inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside

A huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely
missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired mans head clean off -
nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across

and out the other side of the cabin

And Jacobs seat drops down - sending him and us into
EXT SKY - NIGHT

Like an intricate ballet Jacob his body strapped to his
chair tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to
merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and
tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a
flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the
nighttime clouds and Jacobs shrieking face

And Jacob falls and falls and falls his hair sticking
straight up from the blasting wind

Thats when CORPSES start falling past him The captain of
the plane - the stewardess her body bent in half - the
greyhaired man his head gone but his book still in his hand
More men women crew people - and CHILDREN

But these children arent dead bodies Two LITTLE GIRLS and
one LITTLE BOY all dressed in white plummet down next to
Jacob head first like high divers And theyre singing

THE CHILDREN
One two Freddys coming for you

The children turn around in the sky so that they are
travelling feet first The Little Boys pants puff up and
the Girls skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking
away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their
hair

THE CHILDREN (contd)
Three four better lock your door

Leaving three tiny SKELETONS - taunting and laughing as Jacob
screams and covers his eyes

THE CHILDREN (contd)
Five six grab your crucifix

And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the
wind catching them and sending them up and away as their
voices echo in the sky

THE CHILDREN (contd)
Seven eight gonna stay up late

Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to
frantically pull on his seat belt SNAP - it flies off his
back and miraculously turns into a PARACHUTE Rope swirls
into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacobs body
slows with a violent jerk

But at least hes not falling anymore Jacob catches his
breath as he starts gently floating through the sky He
smiles This isnt so bad This is actually kind of fun
Not for long though because his new upward momentum carries
him back up to
The winged childrens Skeletons Jacobs eyes bug out as he
rises into them and they start to circle They move closer
and we can see something in their hands

SCISSORS

Jacob twists his body trying to steer his parachute away
from the demons One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face
and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacobs eyes It
sings alone

CHILD
Nine ten never sleep again

The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the
scissors blades into Jacobs sockets The arms swings
toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head heading
for

THE CHUTES STRINGS

The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one
of the ropes The other two Skeletons join it over Jacobs
head The three of them look down at Jacob their boney jaws
in a perpetual smile

JACOB
No

The Skeletons nod yes SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away
at Jacobs parachute as he swings underneath them trying to
pull away - SNIP - SNIP

The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and
Jacob plummets

ON JACOB

We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the
clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him The
ground becomes a town the town becomes a block the block
becomes a house the house becomes a roof and

INT JACOBS BEDROOM - NIGHT

KA-BLAM The ceiling explodes as Jacobs body plows through
slams down shatters the bed and we immediately

CUT TO
INT JACOBS BEDROOM - MORNING
Jacobs eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold
sweat A dream The worst fucking dream from hell anyone

would ever want to have -- but still just a dream He takes
a few deep breaths as a soft KNOCK is heard at the door
JACOB
Yeah

ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in Shes
thirty-two blonde with a caring smile

ALICE
You okay honey

JACOB
Yeah Mom Im fine

ALICE
Alright Better get cooking or youll be

late for school

JACOB
On my way
Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches
Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and
Jacob walks over to it He reaches out and pulls up the
shade

And theres nothing buy sky Jacob frowns and pokes his head
out the window

JACOBS POV - THE GROUND

is once again racing up towards us at seven-thousand miles an
hour The entire house is falling

BACK IN THE BEDROOM

Jacob leaps away from the window The WINGED SKELETONS
reappear outside -- dancing in the air -- cackling with glee

The bedroom starts to SHAKE violently as Jacob stumbles into
the center The roof starts caving in and the walls begins
to crumble

ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON JACOB

Jacob grabs his head looks up at us and SCREAMS We
suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we
punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an

ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE HOUSE

as it falls away towards the ground We watch as it becomes
a small dot - and finally impacts on the surface A mushroom
cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below

EXT TOWN - NIGHT - AT THE CRATER

Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth
Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant
toothpicks Some of the toothpicks start to move

Jacob rises out of the destruction charred scraped
battered and unfortunately alive He climbs up to the edge
of the crater He looks back a the remnants of his home

Then something starts to happen

Something his growing from the crater - spreading out Its
not a cloud its not smoke - its a DARKNESS Even though
its night this darkness is darker It creeps out from the
hole - fingers of blackness reaching out What it covers
doesnt disappear It becomes GLOOMY The shroud is getting
bigger

And its getting faster Jacob runs

WITH JACOB - RUNNING

He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic
He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger its
gloominess covering houses Then whole blocks

Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW

AT THE STREET CORNER

Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog He stops and
yells at her

JACOB
Get the hell out of here Its coming

WOMAN
Whats coming

Jacob points down the street The shroud is swooping down
the road - browning out street lights in its wake And the
woman doesnt find anything threatening about this Jacob
screams at her

JACOB
Dont you see it

WOMAN
See what

And its obvious now she doesnt see anything The Woman is
totally oblivious to the danger Jacob shakes his head --
stumbles away

The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER
She sighs

And begins to MUTATE Her hair gets scraggly her skin
bursts out in sores her back grows a hump -- all of which
she DOESNT seem to notice
She just shrugs her twisted shoulders

WOMAN (contd)
Kidswatcha gonna do

She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and
two heads

BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING

Like a bat running from hell he tears through the streets
passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become
passively accepting monsters

A VOICE booms out from nowhere

FREDDY (OS)
Jacob Youre too old to run away from
home

Jacob covers his ears and races out of town
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town He
rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him most of the town
is covered in an opaque gloom

Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its
source

HIS POV THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN

The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over
almost all of it now The sign reads WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD
POPULATION

And the numbers after the word population are changing
Theyre counting BACKWARDS clattering away like an old-time
gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the
thousands digit disappears then the hundreds then
tens then

CLINK - the count stops at 1 Springwood is entirely
engulfed in the shroud There is a pause

CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground It
vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of
the road The crack grows - moving out to the center of the
highway

BACK ON THE STREET

Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of
the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build The tar in
front of Jacob becomes molten It bubbles and pops

Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from
boiling asphalt

Its a hat

The hat a fedora to be precise pushes itself up A left
hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it Four sharp
blades jut out of the muck on the other side A head is up
now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat -
hiding the face The body beneath the head ascends The
veil of asphalt parts

Its FREDDY KRUEGER Jacob SCREAMS

Freddy LAUGHS He shakes off his layer of tar and looks
towards the clouded town of Springwood A look of pure
hatred appears on his ragged face

FREDDY
Payback time

Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then
INHALES an even larger one

A WINDSTORM starts the source being Kruegers own lungs
The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding
Springwood Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and
towards Freddys mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE
Freddy continues to inhale like hes never going to stop

Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the
entire town of Springwood is going with it Trees
buildings cars picket fences Its all crumbling and
fusing becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in
the nightmarish wind tunnel all piling into Freddys mouth

The vortex swirls into Krueger Then its gone Nothing but
a vacant lot the size of a town remains Freddy turns to
Jacob and BURPS it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP

JACOB
No

FREDDY
Dont worry I have a strong stomach

Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater
He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - anda
transparent stomach

Inside the stomach a black swirling mass Flashes of
houses people homes couples all trapped in horrible

anguish Freddy drops down his sweater

FREDDY (contd)
Springwood is mine boy

JACOB
I dreamed you away before I was born
Mom said you couldnt come back

FREDDY
Is that true Then she told you all
about me huh Lets see what else she
has to say

Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his
feet digs around a bit then pulls out

ALICE Jacobs mother Tar dripping down her body Krueger
has her by the neck waves his blades in front of her Jacob
gets up and runs toward him

Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob
back a good fifteen feet

ALICE
Run Jacob

The boy rolls painful on the hard road He sits up and
screams

JACOB
Leave her alone

FREDDY
Youre such a mommas boy

Freddy swings his knives out pauses for a terrifying beat
then swoops the daggers towards Alice

CLOSE ON JACOB

as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH Jacob
shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish

WIDE ON SCENE

Were far enough away so that we dont barf at the sight but
close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alices body on
his blades He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp
figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD

Krueger swings his arm out shaking off Alice sending her
flying over Jacobs head The body lands behind him

ON JACOB

as he runs to his mother She VANISHES just as he reaches
out to touch her bloody body He turns to Krueger and raises
his fists A look of sheer rage is growing in him blind
insane anger He bellows
JACOB
You fucker

FREDDY
Springwood is only the beginning All I
need from you is a ride

Suddenly between Jacob and Freddy three SHAFTS OF LIGHT
burst up from the road Three FIGURES appear as the light
dissipates

Theyre dressed in metallic black heavy boots helmets with
dark visors covering their faces One is large and muscular
The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under
her skin-tight outfit The third is a little smaller than
the other two with a slightly different face that allows us
to see his mouth

heyre the DREAM POLICE Jacob doesnt know this yet but
Freddy seems to The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns
at the sight of these new apparitions

Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob

FREDDY (contd)
See ya later

Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit
Two of the black figures start after him The third one
turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after
Freddy The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING

SOUND COP
WAKE UP

Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly

CUT TO
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
Jacobs eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash
Hes lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal
position Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up He
shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and thats when he
notices something in his hand
INSERT JACOBS HAND
its a bracelet a simple band of gold with a larger plate in
the middle like an ID band Jacobs fingers turn the plate
over Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelets

former owner ALICE Jacob has a souvenir

BACK TO JACOB
He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him It
goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty
fields

This is where Springwood used to be A look of anguish
crosses Jacobs face as he stares at the desolation

JACOB
Mom

HONK SCREECH

Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van
blasting right at him He rolls off to the side of the road
The truck barely misses him kicking up a cloud of dust in
its wake

Jacob chokes on the dust He slowly recovers and looks back
down at the bracelet in his hand He clenches his fist around
it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him He takes
a few deep breaths then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME
ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY

We can see a pickup truck in the distance Jacobs HAND
ENTERS FRAME thumb sticking out his mothers bracelet
dangling from his wrist

The pickup truck starts to slow down

EXT ROSEDALE - DAY

A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and
cheerful houses It looks a lot like Springwood the only
real difference being that it actually exists It also has a
sign WELCOME TO ROSEDALE POPULATION 8786

A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of
blocks down the road from us Jacob steps out of the
passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye He
shuffles into town

CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN

It reads DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE

The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry
expression MR HOPKINS

MR HOPKINS
Clean up your act somewhere else

He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE
EXT ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY

Its a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a
usually quiet neighborhood Today the home is surrounded by
about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs NO HALFWAY
HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DONT LOWER OUR PROPERTY
VALUES and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL The crowd mumbles
amongst itself occasionally bursting out with a chant in
protest

ON JACOB

We catch him walking down the sidewalk He tramps along with
his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the
pavement He looks like he hasnt slept in days The sound
of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention

Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young
girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES She
is KAREN MILLER dark hair sixteen very pretty but with a
faraway look in her eyes

Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a
zombie She doesnt turn to look at him as he speaks

JACOB
Whats going on

KAREN
Free speech The right of assembly

JACOB
What is this place

KAREN

Its a home A foster home For
teenagers Its where you go when things
get bad Its the place to figure out
what to do next Its a home for kids
that no one else wants

(beat)
Its MY home

Karen hasnt looked at Jacob once She suddenly seems to
steel herself and walks away from the bush towards the
house Jacob is befuddled

JACOB
Oh

He stands there and watches
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people head
up eyes staring forward The crowd parts ever so slightly
as the irked townsfolk start to heat up They have an actual
human to vent their anger on now Mr Hopkins lays in on her
as she passes him
MR HOPKINS
Why cant you find somewhere else to
shack up

Karen turns to him still walking flustered and hurt

KAREN
What have we ever done to you

MR HOPKINS
NothingYET

Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler
head Her groceries tumble onto the grass A hand reaches
down to help her Its Jacobs

He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr Hopkins
looms above them Both angry and embarrassed now

MR HOPKINS (contd)

Look weve been here for years This is
a quiet street Wed just like to keep
it that way

Jacob cant take this guy anymore He stands up and faces
the older man with a scowl

JACOB
Lighten up mister

MR HOPKINS

(smirks)
And what gutter did you crawl out from

(frowns)

We dont want your kind here

JACOB
My kind What kind is that

MR HOPKINS

JACOB

questions for youDo you love your

JACOB

JACOB
Whats it like

Jacob stares at Hopkins He doesnt answer He just huffs
and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front
porch of the home then into the floor

INT FOSTER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

Karen slams the door and takes a deep breath

KAREN
Assholes

JACOB

Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a
wall to hold himself up Karen looks concerned

KAREN

JACOB

KAREN

Then come help me unpack
She smiles and leads him further into the house
INT FOSTER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while
Karen finishes putting the rest of the food away

KAREN

JACOB

KAREN

JACOB

FOOTSTEPS are heard from below and a couple in their mid-
thirties enter from the basement door Theyre DAVID and
MARY ROSS both greasy and frustrated

MARY

They both start washing up at the sink not really noticing
the teenagers in the room Karen speaks up

leaves the room Karen gives Scott an angry look

JACOB

SCOTT

with cigarettes

GINA
His parents used to use them as a sick

gives Karen a confused glance

KAREN
His dad used to beat him One day he
couldnt take it any more

JACOB

KAREN
He killed him with his fathers gun
Self-defense

Jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in Gina
scootches away from him on the couch then gives him a glum
look

GINA
Everyone here has a fun tale to tell

Isnt that right Karen

Karen is staring out the window She has that spaced-out
expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush

KAREN
Yeah Right

No one has anything left to say Gina turns the sound on the
TV back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons

INT FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - NIGHT
Jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of NICK AT
NIGHT bandw sit-com re-run A cheerful family lovingly banters

away on the flickering tube Jacob just stares blankly

Karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee-shirt
with a glass of mil

KAREN
Why dont you go to bed

JACOB

KAREN

JACOB
No Im fine Thanks

Karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed Jacob
continues watching TV with a creepy glean in his tired eyes

INT OLD WAREHOUSE - DAY

The kids are here cleaning up the building The guys throw
rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up We
catch Jacob and Scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow
Jacob looks pretty ragged

SCOTT
Come on Lets hop to it Gotta make
way for those new indoor tennis courts
The fate of the world lies in the
balance Okay this loads full

Jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks
it up Scott sneers

SCOTT (contd)
You got that

JACOB
Yeah no problem

SCOTT
I dont know Maybe you should think
about switching to de-caf or something
Jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along Scott
takes some time off to smoke a cigarette He spots Karen
across the room bending over with a dustbin Scott lingers
on this view for a long time

AT A DUMPSTER
Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the

junk Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping She tries to
push a large crate aside by herself but slips and falls

Jacob jumps over to her reaches out and grabs her arm to
help her up

JACOB
You okay

Gina SCREAMS

GINA
No Yes Let go of me

She shakes off his grip and he jumps back She runs away
with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused
Jacob

KAREN
She doesnt like to be touched

JACOB
No shit

KAREN
Dont take it personally Its not her
fault

JACOB

What happened to her

KAREN
Her mother was a hooker She forced Gina
to carry on the tradition When she was

Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern Karen gives
him the same expression

KAREN

JACOB

bit The supervisors not around You

JACOB
I think I will

He gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm and Karen likes
it Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off
for it

ON SCOTT

Hes watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen
and he DOESNT like it

WITH JACOB

as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing
the brick wall He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the
inside of the building

JACOBS POV - THE BRICK WALL

sits there quietly for a few beats until

IT EXPLODES

Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall
revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through

DREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

Horrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us Gloomy
buildings under a pitch black sky MUTANTS and twisted
MONSTERS Shadowy streets and dark alleyways And FIVE
RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky

and down upon us as a VOICE rings out

VOICE
Hey you

INT WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB
Jacobs eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him

SUPERVISOR
No slacking off Back to work

The boys eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a
babbling crazy man

JACOB
What Jesus fuckingOh shit

SUPERVISOR
Whoa Get a grip boy

The supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to
reality again

JACOB
Huh Whats going on

SUPERVISOR
Nothing Thats the problem Now that

if you can change it okay

Jacob calms down and nods He walks away snatching a
nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall

EXT FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of
the house go to bed

INT WESLEY and JACOBS BEDROOM - NIGHT

staring out the window Wes switches off the lights and
turns to Jacob

WESLEY

Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness

JACOB

WESLEY

WESLEY
Youre not a shark

JACOB
I know Im just a kid Dont worry
about me Wes Go to sleep

Wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers Jacob
continues to stare out the window desperately trying to keep
his eyes open

JACOBS POV - THROUGH WINDOW

the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside There is a
pause Then we are suddenly PULLED THROUGH THE WINDOW
SMASHING glass careening back into

DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD

We SAIL through the gloomy air over the creepy buildings
And suddenly DIP DOWN right for the street and end up
CRUISING three inches off the asphalt really ripping down
the road until we grind to a SUDDEN HALT Right in front of

FREDDYS FEET Our shot TILTS UP Freddy looms above us and
grins

FREDDY
You cant stay awake forever boy

He LAUGHS his mouth gaping wide and then splitting open
impossibly wider Something starts pouring out of his mouth

right at us

Hundreds of GIANT BUGS spew down upon us covering us
completely as everything goes to BLACK and we

INT WESLEY and JACOBS BEDROOM - NIGHT
ON JACOB
his eyes are open his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM

It looks like his head is about to explode He lifts his
hand up to his face Hes holding an eight-inch long MONSTER
BUG

Jacob SCREAMS out loud this time tosses the mutant insect
away It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening

Jacob jumps to his feet sending his chair tumbling backwards
with a CRASH He shakes and moans a little drool dripping
down his chin

Wesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob

WESLEY
I told you youd go nuts

Jacob catches his breath gives Wes a dead serious look
JACOB
Get everybody else I have to tell them

something

WESLEY
In the middle of the night

JACOB
I MEAN it

Wesley is shocked by Jacobs manic state and jumps out of
bed

INT FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT
Five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of

sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief Jacob paces back
and forth

SCOTT
I dont get it Is this guy alive or
dead

JACOB

Hes neither He haunts your dreams and
if he kills you you die for real

Wesley the most gullible of the group looks pretty scared

WESLEY
I havent dreamed of him I have
nightmares like you wouldnt believe but
never of this guy

SCOTT
Thats because this all rates an eleven
on the bullshit meter I dont know why
we have to listen to this crap Youre
scaring the hell out of Wes here

GINA
Keep your voice down

SCOTT
It doesnt matter The Rosss sleep like
rocks which is what we all should be
doing

JACOB
I know this sounds crazy but I swear
its true I went to bed one night and
woke up in the middle of the road
Freddy Krueger killed my mother blasted
my whole town into his nightmare and
worst of all I think he wants to use me
to kill more kids and bring more towns
into his world

KAREN
How

JACOB
Im not sure I think Im some kind of
carrier Hes somehow inside me and as

soon as I fall deep enough into sleep
hell be let loose You guys were great
to take me in I just dont want to
thank you by getting you all killed

Scott gets up and goes to a desk He pulls out a map and
shows it to Jacob

SCOTT
Okay Show me Springwood

Jacob looks at the map and points

SCOTT (contd)
Theres nothing there

JACOB
Thats what Ive been trying to tell you

SCOTT
Theres NEVER been a town there

JACOB

Thats how YOU see it I was part of the
nightmare so Im the only one who
notices the difference

Scott stares at Jacob He actually grows sympathetic

SCOTT
Look Jacob You dont have to convince
us that nightmares are real Everybody
in this room has been through one And
some of us are still living it But the
thing is we know its just in our heads
now It can be just as bad as the real
thing was but its still only a memory
It cant hurt us physically unless we do
the hurting ourselves

GINA
And we dont want to see you get hurt

WESLEY
We know it gets crazy And well help
out the best we can

SCOTT
But this is just too hard to believe

Jacob plops down on the couch defeated He hangs his head
while the kids start to get up Wesley gives him a pat on
the back as he Scott and Gina leave But Karen is still
here

She sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes
Jacob looks up at her

JACOB
You dont believe me either do you

KAREN
I dont know

JACOB
Why are you still here

KAREN
Im not sure I guess I guess I see a
lot of me in you

JACOB
Feels good to see someone more fucked up
than yourself huh

Karen smiles and sits down next to him

KAREN
Yeah That must be it

JACOB
But you havent told me why youre here
at this place

KAREN
I cant talk about it right now Maybe
later Do you want me to stay with you

JACOB
Yeah thatd be great Dont let me
sleep okay
KAREN
Ill do my best

She reaches for the remote control and flicks on the TV
moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the
couch The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes

KAREN (contd)
Thank God for cable TV

JACOB
Yeah Thank God

They continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of
Jacobs hand

INT FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - MORNING

We are ON KAREN as she sleeps curled up on the couch Jacob
is in the background putting on his shoes He has a brown
paper bag with him

Jacob gets up grabs his bag and steps over to Karen He
gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face Then he
heads for the front door

EXT FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him He
crosses to the porch steps and stops He has to hold onto a
porch column just to keep standing

Karen appears behind him Jacob jumps a bit

KAREN
Where are you going

JACOB
Im leaving

KAREN
Why

JACOB
He cant hurt you if Im gone Maybe
Ill go to the desert or something Ill
lie down in the middle of nowhere and
finally get some sleep Krueger can feed
of the dreams of snakes and vultures

KAREN
Fine Youre just going to take off
then

Karen has an angry expression on his face Jacob gives her a
pained look
JACOB
Dont do this to me Im just trying to
protect you and the others

KAREN
Right You blow into town and then blow
right out Terrific

JACOB
I dont understand why youre so mad at
me

KAREN

You just dont get it do you

JACOB
Get what

Karen though still very angry looks like shes about to
cry Jacob confused sits down on the porch steps

JACOB (contd)
Maybe Im crazy

KAREN
Running away doesnt help

He sighs and smiles a bit

JACOB
And youre going to convince me huh

KAREN
Maybe

This time Karen smiles Jacob looks at her and sighs Then
he yawns

KAREN (contd)
Im going to make some coffee You

promise not to move

JACOB
Yeah Sure

Karen jumps and heads back into the house Jacob stares at
the grass in front of him his eyes heavy

JACOBS POV - THE LAWN
A bush sits there doing nothing Until it suddenly comes TO
LIFE Its leaves start to shrivel the lawn turns brown the

sky turns dark Everything changes and turns into

DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD
Were in a different front yard in a different town in a
different dimension

The mutant bush starts to change sprout legs grow arms
become human

ALICE
Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us

ALICE
Jacob Help me

Shes fully formed now And Freddy bursts out from the
ground behind her He grabs Alice reaches his knife arm
around

ALICE (contd)
No-o-0-0-0

Her words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut
and we re-live her death once more But its even worse this
time

Blood POURS from Alice like a burst fire hydrant spraying
and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human
sprinkler Freddy LAUGHS

FREDDY
Say it dont spray it huh Jacob Come

and join the fun

JACOB (OS)
NOOOOCOOO

Jacobs voice rips through the scene as everything starts to
BLUR RED

EXT FOSTER HOME - FRONT LAWN - DAY

Jacob is lying in the grass violently shaking Karen drops
down next to him

KAREN
Jacob

JACOB
Nooooo

His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an
epileptic seizure He SHRIEKS ignoring Karen completely
and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake Like
hes never going to stop

EXT MR HOPKINS FRONT DOOR - DAY

Were directly across the street from the Foster Home as
Jacobs cries echo through the neighborhood Mr Hopkins
opens the front door He sees whats going on scowls and
yells into his house

MR HOPKINS
I told you Its an overdose Jesus
Christ I saw this coming Call 9-1-1

He watches the commotion growing across the street and never
once moves to help

EXT FOSTER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher babbling
incoherently The residents of the Foster Home stand off to
the side while neighbors gawk from the street Karen is next
to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic

JACOB
No Dont let them take me

KAREN
Jacob itll be alright

AMBULANCE GUY 1
Calm down kid Well take care of you

Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy

JACOB
You dont understand Let me go

The ambulance guy straps Jacobs arm down Mr Ross grabs
Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed
teenager into the ambulance Scott shakes his head Wesley
looks terrified Gina keeps her distance from any human
Karen cant take it and runs into the house Mr Ross
frowns

DAVID
This is just what we need

The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the
kids angrily

INT AMBULANCE - DAY

Jacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a
syringe for injection

JACOB
Dont fucking put me under Youll set
him free

The ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home
Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over
JACOB (contd)
Hell kill them all

Jacobs head starts to go limp A VOICE rings out in the
van a voice only Jacob hears

FREDDY (OS)
Every town as an Elm Street

LAUGHTER echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window
EXT A STREET CORNER - DAY

The ambulance zooms by All is quiet for a second until
CRASH A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk
and settles at an ugly angle

Its an ELM ST sign
INT AMBULANCE - DAY

We PULL BACK from a wide awake Jacob who is now suddenly
alone in the van Outside the window there is only darkness
Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as

CLANG the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and
KA-BOOM the stretcher is shot out of the van like a
cannonball

INT WAREHOUSE - DAY

The stretcher with Jacob BLASTS through a wall and starts to
race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been
sweeping up the day before

It careens along actually taking a few turns like it has a
mind of its own heading for a shallow pit in the middle of
the warehouse

The stretcher hits the pit drops a bit swings up violently
and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been
stepped on AND A BLACK HUMAN SHAPE shoots out of Jacobs body
from intertial force staying upright as it slides across the
floor spins stops then changes into

FREDDY KRUEGER
Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face

FREDDY
Thanks for the lift kid

He saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical
stretcher Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue

JACOB
What do you want from me
FREDDY
I already got it The rest Im going to
get from your new little friends

JACOB
Leave them alone

FREDDY
Its my duty to clean up the
neighborhood

JACOB
What have you done with my town

FREDDY
Aw poor babys homesick isnt he
Dont worry Well all be one happy
family soon Wanna be the first recruit

Freddy raises his blades and SWINGS The straps around Jacob
drop away as his body falls to the floor He scrambles to
his feet and starts to RUN

Freddy laughs

WITH JACOB - RUNNING

as he heads for a door Before he gets there the door
swings open and Freddy leans casually in his way

FREDDY (contd)
Whats the matter Dont want to be part
of my expansion project
Jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse

AT THE DUMPSTER

Jacob races around to the other side and theres Krueger
again

FREDDY (contd)
Today Rosedale Tomorrow the world

JACOB
Over my dead body

FREDDY
As you wish

Freddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob And three
FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy Jacob rolls away
as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare The

light fades The DREAM POLICE have arrived

Well call the small one SOUND COP He stands there
motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from
his clenched teeth This guys bark is worse than his bite

The female in black is BLADE COP From nowhere she produces
two nasty-looking knives one in each hand She spins the
blades in the air like an expert Samurai

The large one well call POWER COP He reaches out for the
dumpster and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a
CRASH Freddy frowns

FREDDY (contd)
Uh oh Too many parking tickets

The Dream Police fan out around Krueger surrounding him
Power Cop leaps at Freddy grabs him and TOSSES him in the
air Freddy tumbles rolls and bounces right back up on his
feet Right next to BLADE

She swings her knives Freddy dodges Swings hi own blades
at her She ducks Freddy spins again Right towards

SOUND COP The short man in black opens his mouth and a
sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT The force
of it hitting Freddy like a fist

Freddy bounces back And once again he nimbly pops up He
glares at the Dream Police

FREDDY (contd)
Dont interfere

BLADE COP
We have to

SOUND COP
Its our job

FREDDY
Get a new one

And Freddy starts to SPIN Slowly at first then faster and
faster until his image starts to BLUR

The Police circle the whirling image holding back to see
what will happen next Krueger stops spinning And his
clothes are different His red and green stripes have been
replaced by black and white ones There is a number printed
across his chest Hes dressed like a CONVICT Freddy
grins

FREDDY (contd)
Time to blow this joint

BOOM A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above
Krueger The building is suddenly filled with the beams of
moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS
A rope falls down through the hole Freddy grabs it and
WHOOSH hes yanked up

FREDDY (contd)
Youll never get me coppers

and away hes gone After a few seconds the spotlights fade
away and the sirens die The Dream Police look up seemingly
unsure of their next action Then Power Cop kicks a pile of
lumber sending wood flying dozens of yards away

POWER COP
Goddamnit

Sound Cop shakes his head Blade looks frustrated Jacob
steps up behind them

JACOB
Alrightjust who the hell are you guys

The black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob
There is a pause Then

BLADE COP
Were the Dream Police

Jacob almost laughs

JACOB
The what

POWER COP
The Dream Police Didnt you hear her
man

Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing
his face Hes a sixteen-year old black boy Heavyset
features sweat dripping down his cheeks Hes KINCAID from
NIGHTMARE 3 And hes pissed

POWER COP (contd)
We try and save this guys ass and then
he goes off and cops an attitude

Sound Cop flips up his helmet Hes JOEY the former mute
boy

SOUND COP
I think youre the wrong guy to talk
about attitudes

BLADE COP
Guys guys This is getting us nowhere

She takes her helmet completely off long dark hair tumbling
over her shoulders Its TARYN the ex-junkie These three
theyre the Dream Warriors Or at least they used to be

JACOB
Hello May I butt in here and ask some
more stupid questions

The three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob Blade
walks up to Jacob Her two partners assume position behind
her

BLADE COP
We dont know much more than you do
What we do know is that weve been
recruited

JACOB
By who

SOUND COP
We dont know

JACOB
Why

BLADE COP
I think thats obvious

POWER COP
The shits about to hit the fan

SOUND COP
Kruegers discovered new powers

BLADE COP
Hes ripped a hole between dreams and
reality

POWER COP

Our own powers have been amplified

SOUND COP
We only hope it will be enough

BLADE COP
But were going to need your help

JACOB
Me What can I do Just who are you
guysreally

Blade puts her helmet back on Her face turns grim

BLADE COP
We were like you We fought Freddy
Krueger many years ago Our souls were
released from his grip No were back to
try again
All three of them drop their visors down at the same time

JACOB
I still dont understand what

Jacobs voice starts to GARBLE He keeps trying to talk but
the words come out twisted and clipped He raises a hand to
his throat The hand is transparent Jacob looks at his
body as it slowly starts to disappear and now hes completely
mute

SOUND COP
Freddy Krueger cant hurt us anymore

POWER COP
Because were already dead

Jacob vanishes completely
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob opens his eyes Hes in bed dressed in a white smock
A DOCTOR stands next to him with a clipboard in hand

JACOB
Whats going on

DOCTOR

JACOB
Thats what you say

DOCTOR

DOCTOR

JACOB

DOCTOR

anxiety attack At least thats what we

Jacob

JACOB

in danger

DOCTOR

JACOB

JACOB
But

DOCTOR

us to put them back on

Jacob drops back in bed The doctor goes to the door and
turns out the lights

DAVID
Sleep

He closes the door behind him

JACOB
Shit

and we hear it LOCK

CUT
A CRAZED LUNATIC
suddenly SCREAMING into the lens with desperation Dark
circles under bloodshot eyes hair matted with sweat A
not having a good day WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
The man is tightly bound in a regulation straight-jacket
tiny claustrophobic holding cell We can now tell that
image is in BLACK AND WHITE We continue PULLING BACK

INT FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT

Gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her

TO

guy

ina
the

lap
watching a béw 1940s potboiler with something less than
enthusiasm Wesley appears in the doorway checking out the
source of the screaming He looks at Gina who tosses the
blanket aside and rises frowning The lunatic on television
continues his blood-curdling SHRIEKS

GINA
Nice movie huh And I came in here to
mellow out

She smiles at Wes as she exits

GINA (contd)
Its all yours

Wesley murmurs a goodnight then looks back at the screen

ON THE TV

Some orderlies enter the lunatics cell and attempt to sedate
him as he thrashes violently SCREAMING bloody murder It is
gritty and awful but somehow riveting

WESLEY

moves to the couch clearly mesmerized by the scene He
curls up absently pulling the white blanket around him as he
watches

ON THE TV

The orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into
their patient who MOANS and SOBS pathetically

ORDERLY ON TV
Relax will ya buddy Everythings gonna
be just swell
The second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of
cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs (He bears a
suspicious resemblance to ROBERT ENGLUND)
WESLEY

vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more
tightly around him to compensate like a cocoon

ON THE TV
The second orderly smiles
SECOND ORDERLY
Yeah mac Youve just had a hard day

thats all

The orderly produces a pack of matches He goes to the
lunatic on the cot and LIGHTS the match off the guys
forehead As the match FLARES the lunatic SCREAMS
CLOSE ON WESLEY

he shuts his eyes tensely as the SOUND is magnified becoming
a sudden ROAR that fills the room

Wesley blinks his eyes open looks around from his blanket
cocoon Whatever that last sound was it did NOT come from
the TV

Beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances
about the room It remains quiet serene Deciding it was
his imagination reacting to the scene on TV Wesley nestles
back on the couch laying down now as the CAMERA MOVES TO
REVEAL

The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though
the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward

BACK ON THE TV the second orderly lights his cigarette as he
hands the pack to the first They both look down at the
madman as they savor their cigarettes

ORDERLY ON TV
You heard the man Wesley Just relax
Have a smoke with us

Wesleys brow furrows reacting to the coincidence Then he
stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the
lit cigarettes over the lunatics face

SECOND ORDERLY
Yeah Wesley Have a smoke

OUR Wesley has seen about enough of this movie He starts to
get up

WESLEY
Fuck this

but finds that he cant move The white blanket around him
restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on TV He
squirms and struggles

WESLEY (contd)
Hey

He struggles harder now but to no avail Hes wrapped
tight like a cigarette

ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed
lunatic poking his face with their lit cigarettes As the
lunatic SCREAMS the screams become magnified again becoming
that loud deafening ROAR we heard before Wesley squirms in
his blanket straight-jacket he jerks his head around
SEEING with each of the mans SCREAMS the walls of the room
SHUDDER INWARD and

Wesleys EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he
TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket but the
walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him He SPINS
back to the TV set where

The first orderly is now looking AT US Wesley REACTS as he
notices something familiar about the mans face

FIRST ORDERLY
Relax Wesley

WESLEY
Dad

The second orderly BOLTS into view He has become Freddy
Krueger

FREDDY
Yeah Wesley Everythings gonna be
great Just have a smoke on us

As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US their arms PROTRUDE
FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes

Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS
the floor with an ugly THUMP The wind knocked out of him
He rolls The couch is GONE

As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon the
frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the
room - furniture carpet TV even the door - are all gone
leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM

Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long
cylindrical white objects Clearly they resemble GIANT
CIGARETTES and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white
blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them

He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from
all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white
things toward him around him bunching them together until
they are in a tight cluster as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY
blocking whatever light source there is until all Wesley can
do is SCREAM one last time and

The screen goes BLACK

After a few beats we hear a huge deafening RIPPING SOUND
and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as Wesley looks up eyes wide
with unspeakable horror as the giant scarred face of FREDDY
looms over him grinning and we

INT FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM

The room is back to normal but not the occupant Freddy
Krueger now stands here alone He has just peeled the
wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become
one

FREDDY
Didnt Daddy ever tell you what the
Surgeon General says

Krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack
As before Wesley is immobile helpless Freddy holds him
between two fingers

FREDDY (contd)
Smokings bad for your health

Freddy looks around as if searching for something then
beams as he reaches into the air and

FREDDY (contd)
Ah A match made in heaven

He produces a puny version of WESLEYS FATHER In one hand
His body is straight and rigid like a match stick

Freddy places his thumb on the stiff mans head and flicks
his thumbnail causing the mans skull to BURST INTO FLAME
an evil grin spanning Wesleys Fathers face

He brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesleys tiny
feet and lights the end

VERY CLOSE ON FREDDYS HAND

Wesley SCREAMS as Freddy tosses the FATHER-MATCH and brings
the teenagers little head up to his fire-scarred lips

The boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy
takes a huge drag off of Wesleys head Where his feet should
be the tip of the Wesley-Cig GLOWS RED causing Wesley to
SCREAM with supernatural pain Smoke billows from Freddys
nose and mouth He savors it

FREDDY (contd)
Ahhhh Now were smokin

He CACKLES horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley-
Cig With each puff Wesleys white-wrapped body becomes
slat-black ash

FREDDY (contd)
Whats your sign Wesley It wouldnt be
Cancer would it

In between his demonic CACKLES Freddy DRAGS on the Wesley-
Cig each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but
his head is black and charred Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig
out poised to tap the ashes loose
FREDDY (contd)
Now say the secret word and you know what
youll win

WESLEY
Go to hell

Freddy grins

FREDDY
Right

And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger The ashes
immediately fall sifting in the air as Wesleys head -
charred and black at the neck where its been separated -
falls loose Wesley SCREAMS

WESLEY
Nooooocooo

and his severed head falls and falls and falls
INT FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

WE START on WESLEYS BODY Eyes closed head normal and
everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso
shriveled limbs all wrapped in the scorched blanket ZIP
A body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we PULL BACK

A FIRE MARSHALL and a COP are talking at the doorway in the
background The CORONER is here a world weary seen-it-all
older guy with his nervous ASSISTANT whos never seen
anything like this They whisper their conversation as they
lift the body bag onto a stretcher

ASSISTANT
I dont get it The couch is barely
scorched And how can he burn from just
the neck down

CORONER
It happens

ASSISTANT
It happens Thats your explanation

CORONER
Ive seen worse

We FOLLOW them as they push the stretcher towards the
doorway

ASSISTANT
What What worse

CORONER
Never mind

Our shot STOPS at the doorway with the fire Marshall and cop
while the wigged-out assistants voice trails off outside

ASSISTANT
No I wanna know Really What could
be worse than

FIRE MARSHALL
You know what the gossip rags are going
to say Spontaneous human combustion

COP
Whats that

FIRE MARSHALL
Thats where bodies are supposed to go up
in smoke for no reason Its all psychic
bullshit What really happened is called
the candle effect A tiny fire gets
started usually from a cigarette It
slowly smolders through the blanket and
clothes until the skin starts to actually
bake The body fat begins to melt and
liquefy fueling the fire like a slow
burning candle It takes hours but its
real

The cop makes some notes Behind them we see Scott Karen
and Gina The girls have been crying and even tough-guy
Scott looks pretty screwed up by all this The cop nods

COP
He fell asleep while smoking What a
waste

The kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men
walk off

SCOTT
Thats impossible

Scott and Karen head for the front door

EXT FOSTER HOME - DAY

A coroners van a fire chiefs car and the now familiar mob
of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the
house as the stretcher with Wesleys body is put away A
small van marked ROSEDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL pulls up and Jacob

jumps out of it

Jacobs face turns grim as a tearful Karen runs up to him
Scott following

JACOB

KAREN

JACOB
Oh my God Its started

SCOTT
He fucking burned alive

KAREN
They said he fell asleep smoking

SCOTT

Mr Ross appears behind the three teenagers a wasted look on
his face

SCOTT
Dont start with that shit

JACOB
Its not shit

DAVID
Cmon kids Everyone inside Now

David leads them back to the house as the coroners van pulls
away

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Jacob Scott Karen and Gina stand around in various states
of utter shock as David tries to console them

DAVID
We have to be strong

He puts an arm around Karen and reaches out to put the other
one around Gina but pulls away at the last minute when she
starts to flinch

DAVID (contd)
We need to pull together and help each
other Mrs Ross is upstairs in bed
Shes pretty messed up We need to help
her deal with this

SCOTT
He would never touch a cigarette You
know that
DAVID
We dont know anything until the
authorities are finished with their
investigation In the mean time no work

Monday its back on the job Jacob
wasnt covered in our health plan and his
little stint at the hospital cost us a
bundle We have to work together or we
might lose this place Okay

The kids all nod but not convincingly They care more about
Wesley than the house

INT WESLEY and JACOBS BEDROOM - DAY

Jacob closes the door All the kids are here Gina
absentmindedly plays with some of Wesleys things

JACOB
When I was put under Freddy was
released I know this because I dreamed
it

SCOTT

And that dream was real

JACOB
Yes Wesley was his first victim

SCOTT
Aw man

JACOB
You said it yourself How could it have
been a cigarette

KAREN
And how could hedire that way and not
wake up
GINA
(mockingly)
Maybe the authorities will figure it
out
SCOTT

Im sorry I just cant buy into this

JACOB
Call me crazybut I think hes after
Rosedale The whole place In my dream
he said something about needing a few
souls to get the job done I think he has
to kill in order to get the power to suck
in a new town
SCOTT
You are crazy

JACOB
Thank you Theres more There are
other people in there In the
nightmares

KAREN

Scott actually laughs

SCOTT

JACOB
Hey Im trying to save all of us

SCOTT
I wont believe it until I see it

Jacob is crushed that hes not getting through to them
JACOB
By then itll be too late It was too
late for Wesley
The kids stare emptily at Wesleys earthly possessions

EXT FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Jacob and Karen sit on the steps Across the street we can
see window curtains part as Mr Hopkins sneaks a wary peek

KAREN
Theyre going to use all this to shut us
down

JACOB

I know Its my fault

KAREN
You going to try to run away again

JACOB
Its too late for that I have to stay
and try and put a stop to it

KAREN
Im sorry Its all so hard to accept

JACOB
I wish I could convince you of the danger
you and the others are in

KAREN
Ive been in danger before THAT I can
handle

JACOB
This is worse than anything you can
imagine

KAREN

I wouldnt be so sure about that Come
on Lets go inside

She stands up
INT KARENS ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob and Karen lie in bed clothes on cozy Not sexual
She stares at the ceiling while he listens
KAREN
She was great Loving Supportive
caring - everything a mom should be
Except she had one fatal flow my father
You see she was raised at a time when
they still had the obey part in the
wedding vows He was always jealous
She couldnt talk to another man without
him thinking she wanted to go to bed with
him He never hit me But the things he
did to herand she would always just
take it She never fought back Hed
get drunk andshed tell people she
just fell down or something Then one
nightI was thirteen Something
happened My mom suddenly wouldnt take
it anymore Something made her say
enough is enough She hit back Tat
only made it worse I watched as he hit
her over and over Then he knocked her
down the stairs She broke her neck
And when y father saw what hed done - he
finally became human He cried over her
body for a while then went into the
garage and blew his brains out with a
shotgun To this day I dont remember
what that final straw was The shrinks
say Ive blocked it out of my memory
Theres no one else alive who knows what
really happened I have dreams about it
sometimes but theres always that blank
spot A missing piece

She stops and closes her eyes Jacob closes his eyes for a
second also - feeling her pain

DIFFERENT ANGLE

Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karens arm She finally
turns to him

JACOB
Im sorry

KAREN
I know nightmares are real Jacob I
know

JACOB
So did my mom She taught me a lot about

dreams

KAREN
Like what

JACOB
She told me that a lot of people have
special dream powers I inherited some
from her - and some I have all to myself
She showed me how I could link up with
other peoples dreams - to actually be
inside with them

KAREN
That sounds wonderful ButI dont
know

JACOB

A little hard to imagine huh

KAREN
Yeah Im sorry

JACOB
I can convince you

KAREN
How

JACOB
Easy Were doing it now

Jacob smiles gets up and walks over to the bedroom door
Karen is confused

KAREN
What do you mean

JACOB
I mean were dreaming You and me
Together

He opens the bedroom door And theres a FOREST OUTSIDE
Karen is a little scared at first totally blown away by
whats happening But then she stands up and smiles

JACOB (contd)
Want to go for a walk

Karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway
into daylight

EXT FOREST - DAY
Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from
the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the

bedroom door

KAREN
I dont believe it

JACOB
Its true Were really doing it
KAREN
But what if Im just dreaming of you
telling me that

JACOB
Well compare notes when we wake up
Then youll know
Karen looks around Then she giggles She likes this a lot
Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited

little girl Jacob frowns

JACOB (contd)
Karen Wait

He heads off after her
AMONGST THE TREES
Jacob runs Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs

JACOB (contd)
You have to be careful

KAREN
Did you bring us here on purpose Can
you go anywhere you want

JACOB
Sometimes Its not as easy as linking
up though

KAREN

Wow I never knew
She starts wandering off again Jacob follows her

KAREN (contd)
You know what I like to do in my dreams

She ducks behind a tree And comes out suddenly dressed as a
sharp BUSINESSWOMAN Jacob is slightly taken aback

KAREN (contd)
I like to be other people

Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN
walks out in her place Jacob is really taken aback this
time

KAREN (contd) (as fireman)
I can be anybody I want

JACOB
Show off
Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall
VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD

KAREN (AS REDHEAD)
When things get bad it helps to be
someone else I use it to protect
myself

The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob He raises his
eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample

cleavage inches away from his nose

KAREN (contd) (as redhead)
What do you think

JACOB
I think I like you the way you always
are
He smiles
DIFFERENT ANGLE

And now Karen is herself again Theyre still very close

JACOB (contd)
Much better

They look like theyre about to kiss but Karen suddenly
sees something that grabs her attention

KAREN
Look

Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR Its not the
one to the bedroom It just hangs there in space between two

trees

KAREN (contd)
I wonder where it goes

She reaches for the knob and opens it

JACOB
Karen no

But shes already stepped through Jacob runs up to the
doorway and it SLAMS in his face Jacob tries to open the
door It doesnt budge He keeps twisting the knob to no
effect

JACOB (contd)
Karen

Jacob starts to pound on the door as we

CUT TO
INT KARENS HOME - KITCHEN

Sixties style decore appliances that look about twenty-five
years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all Karen is
standing in the middle of the room completely disoriented
She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed
picture

Its a picture of HER Karen age thirteen Karen sets the
picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in

INT KARENS HOME - LOWER HALLWAY

Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting hoping to be
back in the forest again Nope She blinks Then she
starts to walk down the corridor

More pictures on the wall this time One of a WOMAN and
another of a MAN (Karens MOM and DAD)

Karens sure of it now Shes home The center of her worst
nightmares She creeps along to the main stairs And thats
when the NOISES begin A thumping from upstairs A CRASH
like something hit the floor above More thumping
repeatedly and then human MOANING the sound of pain

Somebody is getting beaten

KAREN
Oh no

Something is twisting deep inside the girl Her face goes
shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the
stairsand starts to climb them

ON THE STAIRS

Karen goes up step by painful step as the sounds of the
BEATING increase in their intensity Every hit seems to
touch Karen as she flinches Shes afraid to go on - but
cant seem to stop

INT KARENS HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Karen slowly heads for a door at the end nervously reaches
out for the knob

INT KARENS PARENTS BEDROOM

Karen opens the door What she thought she was going to see
was bad enough - but this is worse

Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room In front of him
is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching
doll the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back But
the doll doesnt have the image of a clown on it
Its a flattened wrapped-around version of KARENS MOTHER a
pitiful beat-up look on her plastic face

Freddy SMACKS the doll - it falls to the floor - and just
bounces back up And now the face on it has a NEW BRUISE

THWACK He hits it again CACKLING with glee Swoop
bounce More bruises develop Krueger looks at Karen

FREDDY
Welcome to Romper Room

BAP BOOOOING The face on the punching doll changes again
its even sadder now And its looking at Karen

KAREN
Why are you doing this

FREDDY
Dont you remember

ZING Krueger whips up his finger knives SWOOP he RIPS
them through the plastic doll SISSSSSssss The doll starts
to deflate SKREEEEeeeee The escaping air sounding like a
human SCREAM Freddy turns to Karen

And a HAND reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of
the room

INT KARENS HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Jacob pulls Karen away from the door and slams it shut He
grabs her hand

JACOB
Come on

They turn to run down the hallway and its CHANGED There
are now NO DOORS and NO STAIRWAY The only way out is the
bedroom door they just closed They stop and Jacob turns to
Karen

JACOB (contd)
Wake up

KAREN
What

JACOB
You heard me I said wake up

KAREN
How This is my old house How did I

get here

He begins to shake her She is confused and disoriented A
CRASH is heard at the bedroom door FREDDYS COMING

And Jacob HITS Karen Nothing major Its a good slap
nonetheless She stares at him unbelievingly He WHACKS her
again

KAREN (contd)
Why are you doing this to me

JACOB
This is a dream You have to get out of
here Im not hurting you only he can
really do that Wake up now

SLAP Karens getting angry She doesnt know what shes
supposed to do KA-BLAM Freddy blasts through the door in
a shower of splinters He sees them and grins

FREDDY
Gettin kinky huh

Jacob turns to Karen raises his hand KA-BLAM Something
blasts through the wall across from them Its POWER COP

CRASH The other wall explodes BLADE appears in the
rubble

BOOM A piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor
SOUND COP steps through

Karen looks at all this nonsense then at Jacob

KAREN
I think I get it now

She closes her eyes and DISAPPEARS out of Jacobs hands The
DREAM POLICE stand in the hallway Freddy just puts his
hands on his hips and LAUGHS at them

Then Krueger lays his arms flat on his sides takes a deep
breath and begins to INFLATE His body expands his clothes
and skin stretch and flatten The bottom half of him getting
fatter

He turns into a giant FREDDY PUNCHING DOLL

Power Cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose
a devastating swing POW The Freddy Doll swings back and
BOUNCES right up again

POW POW POW POW POW The big Dream Cop pummels away at the
Krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and
his fist until SHINK Two knives appear in Blades hands and
SWOOP She swings them out

RIP The Freddy Doll tears air blasting out in a grating
SHRIEK which screeches and hisses until it becomes
Freddys LAUGH The red and green plastic flutters to the
ground as the evil guffaws fade away and we

CUT TO
INT KARENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Karen shakes Jacob awake His eyes open They stare at each
other for a few beats then Karen frowns

KAREN
You hit me

JACOB
Are you hurt

KAREN
Umno

JACOB
If he had done it youd be dead

Karen is confused She doesnt know what to make of all
this She looks at a clock Its late

KAREN
You better get back to your room We
dont want anybody to get the wrong idea

JACOB
(smirks)
Or the right one

Karen finally relaxes She smiles and playfully pushes him

KAREN
Get out of here

Jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out Its
the framed photo of Karen age thirteen - from her dream He

hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment

JACOB
Thats something else my mom taught me

He gets up and goes to the door turning back to her

JACOB (contd)
Dont sleep

KAREN
No Not tonight

She holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those
faraway eyes
INT FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jacob starts to get defiant
JACOB

DAVID

David catches his breath He looks like he wants to say
more but doesnt have the energy left He just walks out of
the room leaving a frustrated Jacob

EXT FOSTER HOME - NIGHT

Mr and Mrs Ross are getting into their car The engine
starts and they drive away

INT JACOBS ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob sits in bed staring into space Karen quietly enters
the room carefully shutting the door behind her

She sits down next to him Jacob looks at her with weary
eyes

JACOB

She kisses him quickly on the cheek He needed that Karen
gets up and quietly leaves Jacob yawns

INT GINAS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gina sits on her bed in her night clothes She holds a deck
of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed
sheets

She flips a card from her deck A black nine She puts it on
top of a ten Another card Queen of diamonds She lays it
on top of a king of clubs Gina yawns Takes another card

Its the Freddy of Spades

Gina frowns Freddy Kruegers image stares up at her from
the card She looks at her stacks Theres no place to put
this one She starts flipping through the deck of cards
trying to see if there are any more Freddys Thats when a
HAND RIPS UP through the bed and grabs her arm

Gina SCREAMS pulls away from the hands grip and jumps back
up on the bed And ANOTHER HAND shoots up from a pillow and
grabs her shoulder Gina twists

RIP TEAR GRAB More hands appear out of the mattress
lunging for any part of Ginas body as she SHRIEKS from their
touch And Gina jumps out of bed

She leaps to the other side of the room bumping against her
dresser drawers Turns to her bed

SWOOP The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress
There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath

Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers
next to her Latching indiscriminately Some grabbing her
legs and arms Some grabbing more intimate parts

Gina SCREAMS Pulls away from the dresser Yanks a few
drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another
wall

Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her
Two grab her hair Three on each arm Her legs are pinned
Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms Beating the hands
with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously She
starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND
SCARRED pops out between her legs Aiming right for her
crotch and in an incredible show of strength the girl pulls
away from the horde

Gina heads for the door CRASH Hands blast up from the
wood floor She leaps around them CRASH More hands try
to block her way

Gina jumps around like shes in a mine field made of hot
coals She finally reaches to door and flings it open

INT ELEVATOR

Gina hits the lifts opposite wall having expected it to be a
hallway The elevators doors close on her bedroom and she
turns to see

Freddy A razor finger poised over the elevators buttons
He smiles politely

FREDDY
Going up

Gina is shocked and speechless She backs away into a corner
like someone trapped in a closet with the devil Which is
exactly what she is

Rising past the terror is Ginas realization that everything
Jacobs been saying is true

FREDDY (contd)
At your service

He punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES Gina
grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually
begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly

GINA
Youre not real

FREDDY
Ah but who is

The elevator begins to slow

FREDDY (contd)
Fourth floor Overpopulation

The elevator stops The doors begin to open Gina leaps for
the way out But shes blocked

Blocked by PEOPLE They fill the entrance to the lift and
start to pile in All kinds of people businessmen nurses
plumbers And theyre all ZOMBIES

Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies
keep coming in Pushing Gina back into the elevator
Filling it to capacity and beyond

The doors close and the elevator starts to move up Twenty
bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure smashed together
surrounding the poor teenager drool oozing out of their
mouths breathing down her neck SMASHING her so hard she
cant even yell for help Gina turns her head

WESLEY is pressed up next to her A very dead look on his
face Begin squeezed by the zombies around him One of his

eyes POPS out of its socket

Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream
FREDDY (contd)
Eight floor - the morgue

The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to
spastically pile out Gina having only been held up by the
crushing bodies falls to her knees as the last of the
monsters exit the lift She breathes in ripping gasps like
shes having a coronary But she sees the open door And
Gina jumps for the exit

Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently Gina
falls to the floor again as the doors shut Freddy waves his
fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very
bottom one This button doesnt looks like the others

Its in the shape of a little heart
Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look

FREDDY (contd)
Time to go down Gina

He presses the heart button And the floor disappears Gina
falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and
LAUGHS

INT HONEYMOON SUITE

Gaudy colors mirrors a cheesy heart-shaped bed Ginas
body drops down unexpectedly softly landing on the fluffy
satin sheets

shes dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE She
moans and tries to sit up

And four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the
bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs pulling her
down and yank her tight

Shes trapped Thats when the door to the room opens and in
walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN He barely fits through the
door as he closes it behind him Puffy cheeks permanent
seat dirty fingernails and a lecherous smile

Ginas eyes widen
FAT MAN
Hi there princess Your moms told me

all about you

Gina SCREAMS as he approaches her the ground actually
shaking from his weight

FAT MAN (contd)
She said youre even better than she is

He looms above her now Starts to unbutton his shirt to
reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh Gina is
repulsed

FAT MAN (contd)
Aw come on Im really a nice guy You
know what they say Inside every fat
person

RIP Kruegers finger blades JUT out of the abdomen ad start
tearing a huge SLIT up the front of his body The Fat Man
starts to fold back as Freddys head pops out of the front

FREDDY
is a maniac trying to get out

Freddy steps out of the Fat Man sluffing the bulbous remains
aside He towers over Gina That creepy serious look on his
face again

FREDDY (contd)
Now its time for YOU to put out Gina

Gina gasps in horror as Krueger moves in But then a KNOCK
at the door

ROOM SERVICE (0S)
Room service

FREDDY
Huh I didnt order anything

Freddy frowns and walks over to the door He turns back to
Gina

FREDDY (contd)
Maybe its complimentary champagne

Krueger opens the door On the other side is a dinner cart
and a waiter behind it The waiter is JACOB

CRASH Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into
Freddys gut shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled
heap Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room The
Dream Police materialize

Freddy jumps up growling Power Cop grabs him from behind
Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel releases
Gina from her satin bonds Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and
pulls her towards the door

JACOB
Come on

Freddy jumps out of Power Cops grip and the Dream Police
surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room

INT HOTEL HALLWAY
Jacob pulls Gina along as the hotel room door SLAMS shut by
itself Gina yells at Jacob

GINA
Let go of me

She squirms out of Jacobs grip and bounces away from him
like he has the plague CRASHING is heard from the hotel
room A violent battle is under way Jacob pleads with

Gina

JACOB
Im here to help

He holds out his hand to her Gina shivers than looks into
Jacobs sincere eyes SOUNDS of destruction continue behind
the door as the girl battles with her worst fear Finally
Gina takes Jacobs hand

GINA
Lets get out of here

They start running down the corridor - together

INT HONEYMOON SUITE

The entire room is filled with SWIRLING DUST and SMOKE
completely obscuring everything from sight As the sound of
BREAKING FURNITURE and grunting fighters echoes a few pieces
of debris bounce into view

And then there is SILENCE

The dust settles and the smoke dissipates The DREAM POLICE
stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room

POWER COP
Whered he go

SOUND COP
I thought you had him

BLADE COP
Shit

Krueger has escaped
HOTEL CORRIDOR

Jacob runs Gina trailing behind him the two of them trying
to find a way out They pass a door

The door SLAMS open and Freddy reaches out grabs Gina and
yanks her into the room The door BANGS shut

Jacob twirls around and runs towards the door
And the door DISAPPEARS Nothing but flat wall remains as
Jacob hits it He starts banging his fist against the side
of the corridor

JACOB
No no no no

The Dream police run up next to him Jacob spins around
angry

JACOB (contd)
Hes got Gina

SOUND COP
Stand back

Everyone backs off Sound Cop opens his mouth BOOM An
almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and
CRACK a huge hole is punched in the wall

The Police leap into the hole quickly followed by Jacob
INT HOTEL ROOM

This ones pretty normal Maybe the business suite And
its EMPTY except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the
middle of the bed Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as
Blade picks up the box and opens it Dozens of COCKROACHES
pour out onto the floor Now Jacobs really pissed

JACOB
You let him get away

SOUND COP
Its difficult

POWER COP
Hes been at this longer than we have

BLADE COP
He can do anything

SOUND COP
But we have to catch him in the act to

JACOB

INT LIMBO

All is BLACK Except for Freddy and Gina He has her from

behind his hands locked on her shoulders

FREDDY
Ahalone at last

Gina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds
away Freddy wraps his arms around her hugging her

And he KEEPS wrapping his arms They STRETCH and elongate
wrapping once around his body and then around hers again

Freddys rubber limbs curl around and around
Spiraling up and down
touching and

And then again
an around Ginas quivering body
Encircling on all sides on every part of her
grabbing her EVERYWHERE

Until Kruegers arms cover her entirely Gina whimpers

FREDDY (contd)
Touching isnt it
And he starts to SQUEEZE Gina gags as Freddys snake-like
embrace TIGHTENS around her draining the life out of Ginas
body

That hit home Jacob uncovers his face His ID bracelet
dangles from his wrist He looks at the bracelet ALICE
glints in the setting sunlight He remembers Jacob looks
up at Karen

KAREN (contd)
We still have one night together

JACOB
And were not going to waste it

Jacob stands up
INT JUVENILE HALL LOUNGE - NIGHT
Jacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen

KAREN

SCOTT

SCOTT
The old stomping ground

JACOB
Yeah Only right now its not a very

pretty place

KAREN
What do we do when we get there

JACOB
Play it by ear And try and stay alive

A SOCIAL WORKER sticks his head into the lounge

SOCIAL WORKER
Half hour til lights out everyone

The kids get up and start for the door

JACOB
Off we go

SCOTT
Into the wild black yonder

Scott shakes his head as they leave

INT KARENS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Karen lies in bed under the covers She holds the picture
of herself thirteen years old She stares at it Still
that missing piece

Karen puts the picture on a nightstand and closes her eyes

INT SCOTT and JACOBS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds Jacob is on the
bottom and already looks asleep
ON SCOTT

Hes still awake Maybe hes starting to believe some of
Jacobs ramblings because he nervously fidgets in bed

SCOTT
Freddy Krueger Yeah right Years ago
some sicko gets fried and now he comes
back to stick it to you when youre
snoozing Stupid bedtime story

he sighs looks at his wrist but his watch isnt on Then

SCOTT (contd)
Hey Mr Creepoid you still up
(a beat)
Yo Jacob

Theres still no answer Scott rolls and peeks over the edge
of the bunk bed And Jacobs not there

SCOTT (contd)
Huh

Scott sits up looks around And FALLS right through the
middle of his bed NOT appearing underneath the top bunk He
just disappears

EXT NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - SOUTH STREET - NIGHT

Scott falls out of a tree and lands with a THUD He groans
slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings

The road is dark and desolate The street lights emit a grim
brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky

SOUNDS echo through the trees and buildings Weird MOANS
odd GURGLINGS eerie WHISPERS and an occasional unearthly
HOWL

This does not comfort Scott

SCOTT
Oh this is lovely

He starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk SOMETHING
flies by with a FLAPPING Scott ducks Was it a bird or a
bat or what Its already gone

Then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree

BUM
Hey buddy

SCOTT
Yeah what
Scott is understandably jumpy The dark figure of a BUM
starts walking towards him Scott backs away

BUM
Can you spare some change

SCOTT
Um well let me see

Scott starts sifting through his pockets and the BUM steps
out into the light

He has THREE EYES and a HUMP BACK Scott YELPS

SCOTT (contd)
Holy Jesus Christ

The Bum grins and Scott starts stumbling away his voice
trailing off

SCOTT (contd)
Ill catch you next time buddy

The mutant bum belches
EXT NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - PARNELL AVE - NIGHT

Karen rounds a corner She walks nervously down the middle
of the street There are no cars and she wants to keep as
far away as possible from the houses on either side

There is a CREAKING sound from one of those houses Karen
turns her head to look

A craggy OLD WOMAN is rocking back and forth on her front
porch Shes eating something something stringy and slimy
She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes

The something in her hands MOVES slightly The old womans
meal is still alive

Karen gags and walks faster And a PANTING sound is heard
like two dogs Someone is walking their pet down the
sidewalk

Its the MUTANT WOMAN from Jacobs opening nightmare
straggly hair oozing sores limping The source of the

multiple paintings is her single dog all two heads of it

The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen Karen whimpers
and starts to RUN

WITH KAREN - RUNNING

She stumbles quickly down the street We catch fleeting
glimpses of other horrors twisted shapes bent shadows
Karen rounds a corner and SCREAMS when she bumps into
someone Its Scott out of breath from his own sprinting

KAREN
Scott Youre here

SCOTT
Yeah Fun town Talk to any of the
neighbors yet Theyre a swell bunch of
folks

KAREN
Uh-huh Real friendly too

SCOTT
So this is a dream

KAREN
And Im in it with you Convinced

SCOTT
Maybe Im just dreaming bout being here
with you Wouldnt be the first time

KAREN
Nope I tired that one already Doesnt
work Come on we have to find Jacob

Scott nods and they take off down the street A cat with
three tails slithers by

EXT NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road He
stares down into the darkness a wooden expression on his
face

Karen and Scott are running up behind him

KAREN
Jacob Thank God

SCOTT
So this is the place huh

Jacobs eyes are steady He hasnt yet acknowledged the
others presence He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in
front of him A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our
SHOT MOVES IN on him

JACOB
Im home

Karen and Scott are next to him now They stand silently
with Jacob for a few seconds Then

KAREN
What now

JACOB
Scott are you with us

SCOTT
A deals a deal

JACOB
Then we wait

And not for long FLASH In three bursts the Dream Police
appear directly across from the teenagers Scott and Karen
jump back Jacob hold his ground

SCOTT
Whoa

The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows

SCOTT (contd)
Nice outfits

POWER COP
Is this all

JACOB
All thats left

SOUND COP
Itll have to do

SCOTT
We can always come back later Like when
its daytime

POWER COP
Its always night here

JACOB
Whats the plan

BLADE COP
We need you to draw him out

SCOTT
Terrific Were supposed to be bait

SOUND COP
Essentially

JACOB
Then lets do it

KABOOOOOOOOM A huge BRICK WALL ten feet high and spreading
out across the street and through the houses BLASTS up from
the asphalt Right between the Police and the kids
ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE
The three cops crouch into battle positions
ON THE TEENAGERS SIDE

The three of them have hardly any time to react before three
perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them

And Scott Jacob and Karen fall into darkness
ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE

Sound Cop stands up and his body begins to VIBRATE A new
noise emits from his mouth a HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL

And like the walls of Jericho the bricks in front of them
fall apart and tumble to the ground Dust settles and the
Police walk over the rubble to the other side The kids are
gone

BLADE COP
Fan out

The Dream Police break formation and scatter
EXT A STREET

A hole opens up in the road and WHOOSH KAREN is elevated up
into the scene and the hole seals up instantly

She jumps a few feet and drops to her knees holding onto
the ground She looks up at a street sign It reads ELM
ST Karen stands up and heads down the road

EXT ROCHESTER AVE

Another hole and VOOM Jacob is shot up into the street He
spins around trying to get his bearings It doesnt take
him long He knows exactly where he is

JACOB
Oh no

He starts to run and we FOLLOW him

Jacob jumps over a procession of RATS making their way across
the street and just keeps on sprinting Until he reaches a
certain house He catches his breath as he looks at the
building pain registering on his face

JACOB (contd)
Mom

Jacob runs towards the house as our shot MOVES IN CLOSE to
the mailbox and ate name printed across it It reads
JOHNSON
INT NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

Jacob bursts through the door He turns on a light switch
A lamp SPUTTERS into semi-life and keeps sputtering casting
a candle-like glow over the interior

Cobwebs and dust cover everything Rats and tarantula
spiders skitter about Jacob grits his teeth and walks in
deeper

EXT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

Scott BLASTS out of the asphalt He staggers for a few
seconds from the ride then looks at the building in front of
him A puttering neon sign OSPRINGWOOD TAVERN marks the
local saloon Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the
cracks of the double doors

Scott looks around then shrugs He heads for the entrance
INT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

Dump is too clean a word dive is too nice abomination is
more like it A greenish haze covers everything Instead of
sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that
looks like a compilation of human teeth crushed bugs and
pools of unmentionable goo

Then theres the people

Imagine any profanity any obscenityany blasphemy add them
all up - then double them It wouldnt even come close to
the patrons of this joint

They dance they yell they drink bloody bubbling mixtures
Theres a guy to the right that doesnt seem to mind that
half his brain is showing That girl over there has no jaw
In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips A
ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his
hand up the back of a real body

Scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times
Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn
around and go right back out

A MUTANT BOUNCER half his face a skull blocks Scotts way

MUTANT BOUNCER
Two drink minimum

SCOTT
Ah thats okay I think Im underage
anyway

MUTANT BOUNCER
Two drink minimum

SCOTT
No really Im driving

MUTANT BOUNCER
Two drink minimum

The bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant Scott
backs off and turns around He carefully moves forward A
MUTANT WAITRESS with three breasts slips next to him

MUTANT WAITRESS
Can I get you anything

SCOTT
Thats okay Ill just sit at the bar

MUTANT WAITRESS
Alright honey You call if you need
anything

SCOTT
You bet Youll be the first to know

Scott turns away trying to keep his eyes in their sockets
He slides up to the bar next to a MUTANT BUSINESSMAN The
mans head is on backwards his arms lean on the bar while
his face looks out into the crowd He has to twist his neck
to sip his vile drink

A BARTENDER surprisingly normal-looking steps up to Scott

BARTENDER
Whatll it be

SCOTT
Um a beer I guess

The bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown
liquid Chunks of matter float amongst the foam Scott
takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next
to him The mutant smiles at him

BARTENDER
Go on Puts hair on your back

SCOTT
And thats all

The bartender returns Holds one of those half pineapple
type drinks in his hand except this one has the back end of
a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny
umbrella He gives it to Scott

SCOTT (contd)
Thats okay thisll be plenty
BARTENDER
No charge Compliments of the man at the
end of the bar

The bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look
down the bar

SCOTTS POV

The crowd blocks his view but we can see a gloved hand with
four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the
surface of the wood

BACK TO SCOTT

He picks up his drinks holding the moving one at arms
length and heads down the bar

AT THE END OF THE BAR

sits Freddy Krueger He sips coolly on some hideous
concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and
lights a cigarette trying to look equally cool

FREDDY
Welcome to my favorite haunt

SCOTT
So youre the man

FREDDY
At your service

SCOTT
Whats on your mind

FREDDY
A deal

SCOTT
A deals what got me into this

FREDDY
Bring Jacob to me

Scott valiantly holding on to his nerve raises an eyebrow

SCOTT
Whats in it for me

FREDDY
Power You dont need to hang out with
those losers Youre a take-charge kind
of guy Scott Like when you took charge
of your father
Suddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free
hand Scott grimaces

SCOTT
Leave my father out of this

FREDDY
Ill make you mayor of Rosedale

SCOTT
After you make it look like this

FREDDY
You can have Karen

That was Freddys trump card It really hits a nerve in
Scott Karens everything hes ever wanted

SCOTT
Alive

FREDDY
Any way you want her

SCOTT
(after a beat)
Okay
FREDDY
Shake

Krueger holds out his knives Scott shakes his head

SCOTT
No thanks I trust you

Freddy laughs
INT NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ALICES BEDROOM
Jacob opens the door into darkness

JACOB
Mother

He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room
Jacob looks up The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with
blood

Jacob walks into the room tears welling He walks by
Alices vanity her makeup still sitting there as if she
might show up and use it at any moment

He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it
lightly He reaches out and slowly almost reverently opens
the doors
Dozens of writhing SNAKES drop out of the closet and slither
onto the ground

Jacob jumps back and SCREAMS

Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming
reptile mass not giving a shit anymore going insane His
fists clenched his head tilted back as he YELLS into the
air like a wolf baying at the moon

EXT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

Scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the
street He thinks and we MOVE IN on him

SCOTT
Mayor of Rosedale

Scott sneers

SCOTT (contd)
What a crock of shit

We PULL WIDER as Scott cups his hands around his mouth
SCOTT (contd)
Hey Hes over here Yo Dream Police
Hello Come on Move you collective
asses
CLOSE ON SCOTT

He puts his hands on his hips and sighs

SCOTT (contd)
Never a cop around when you need one

GLITCH a stabbing sound of flesh and Scott JERKS violently
as our shot PULLS BACK to reveal

Freddy behind Scott his deadly fingers buried in the boys
back Scott chokes on his own blood as Krueger growls

FREDDY
I hate a snitch

Freddy pulls out his blades as Scott falls forward and with
his final breath utters

SCOTT
Eat shit

His body hits the ground with a THUD as a sudden ROAR fills
the air Freddy looks around for its source And Sound Cop

drops down on him with a SMACK

The two of them tumble then both jump up Freddy laughs
Sound Cop looks down at Scotts body then back up at
Krueger His body is shaking with furyand he opens his
mouth

The loudest sound yet comes from Sound Cop KABOOM A blast
of air at Mach 3 smacks into Freddy and sends him sailing
back SMASHING right through the Tavern wall

INT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

Freddy flies sideways right through the bar destroying
chandeliers as he careens through and punches yet another
huge hole through the opposite wall

The nightmarish customers dont even seem to notice
INT NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY

Jacob is shuffling down the stairs as a SONIC BOOM of noise
echoes through the streets outside

He knows exactly what that sound means as we MOVE IN on his
face

JACOB
Krueger

Jacob races for the front door
INT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

The dust is just starting to settle as a THUD is heard coming
from the hole in the opposite wall Quickly followed by
Freddys soaring body Krueger SMASHES into some tables and
slides across the floor Power Cop steps through the hole
his fists clenched Freddy stands up and dusts himself off

FREDDY
Lighten up bone brain

Power Cop has no intention to He bolts over grabs Krueger
raises him over his head like a wrestler slams him down on
the bar and SHOVES Freddy knocking glasses and ashtrays
aside until he SMACKS into yet another poor wall

Krueger barely gets back on his feet when Power Cop is right
on him again The big man in black SWINGS but this time
Freddy DUCKS CRACK a support column bursts into dust
Freddy twirls around And the two of them start to PUNCH
each other

Its a barroom brawl between non-humans as Power Cop and
Freddy Krueger exchange multiple blows

SMACK SMACK SMACK Freddy nails Power Cop whose head barely
seems to budge from the hits
POW POW POW Power Cop lays into Krueger sending him
spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the
process all over again

This goes on for a while and Krueger is losing

The mutant bouncer finally steps up to Power Cop to try and
put a stop to all this

MUTANT BOUNCER
Take it outside

CRUNCH Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious
elbow in the chest All this gave Freddy a few seconds to
grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cops head
The pummeling begins again

THWACK THWACK THWACK Power Cop is punching Freddy towards
the door

EXT SPRINGWOOD TAVERN

Like in an old wester Krueger flies out of the double doors
and somersaults onto the pavement Sound Cop is a few yards
away knelt down next to Scotts dead body He looks up as
Freddy sneers

FREDDY
No more playing around

Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND It
grows like an inflated beach ball except it doesnt look
soft at all Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance
and raises his giant hammer hand Power Cop steps through
looking for blood Sound Cop tries to warn him

SOUND COP
Kincaid

Too late BAM Freddys fist slams down on Power Cops
head Hes actually shoved down into the ground a full two
feet - trapped at the legs

BAM Freddy hits him again Power Cop is down to his thighs
and he cant get out

A RUMBLING is heard Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting
to open his mouth Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs
a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop

FREDDY
Put a lid on it

THUNK The brick lands squarely in Sound Cops mouth
stretching it painfully and blocking it completely Sound
Cop reels from the impact Tries to pull out the firmly
wedged plug
Freddy turns back to Power Cop BAM Hits him down to his
hips The giant fist swings BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM like
hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground

Freddys hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the
struggling Sound Cop

Sound Cops head is EXPANDING Pressure seems to be building
up somethings gonna blow Freddy picks up a boulder from
the street rubble He catapults it with both hands at Sound
Cop The boulder hits Sound Cops head and takes it CLEAN
OFF

Sound Cops decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick
still stuck as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of
his neck with a SCREECH

Sound Cops body stumbles for a few seconds then falls over
limply

Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs KACHUNK until a KNIFE
embeds itself in his back Krueger spins around

CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK Three more knives slam into his body as
he staggers back in surprise Blade Cop stands twenty feet
away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after
knife flinging them at Freddy They sail like flying
bullets

CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK Krueger falls back from the sheer force
of the onslaught at least a dozen blades sticking out of his
body

Blade stops She stands there for a beat waiting to see what
Freddy will do next

Krueger sways looking like an inhuman pincushion Then he
grins His body steadies and he suddenly poses like a body
builder and flexes every muscle

POP POP POP The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs
CLATTERING to the ground

The girl in black steps back and raises her arms SHINK
SHINK Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms
Theyre not held by her theyre a PART of her exiting from
the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists She crosses
the blades in front of her

FREDDY (contd)
(smiling)
Ah a girl after my own heart

KACHINK Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND
to double their normal size He raises them and takes on a
fencing stance
FREDDY (contd)
En guard bitch

SWOOPCLANG A swordfight ensues Freddy swinging his four
long knives Blade slashing her rapier-arms They lunge
they parry they leap they duck

CLANG They connect SCREEEEE Metal scrapes metal Its
a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop
and Freddy are equally matched Blade moves to get the upper
hand

CLINK CLINK Blades shoot out of the girls ELBOWS Now
when she takes a swing with her fists another sword is right
behind it on the follow-through

Freddy gets caught off-guard Gets slashed twice in the
shoulder and twirls away Then starts to move FASTER

Blade counters with an equally increased intensity Freddy
ducks SWOOPS out twice quickly A fold of black cloth drops
down on Blades stomach revealing naked skin and a little
blood They pause for a second

FREDDY (contd)
Touche

And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame
twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from
her RIGHT HEEL chopping off Freddys left hand

Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out
of the stump

Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again
swinging away at an incredible rate An impossible rate

JACOB rounds the corner He stumbles into the action just as
the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING
MASS Pieces of them start to drop away

Blades foot hits the ground Freddys arm plops away A
broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud then
one of Blades arms

CLOSE ON JACOB

as he watches his eyes dart to try to follow the action
thats moving too fast for him to see

Then theres silence

We PULL BACK and PAN to follow Jacob as he walks into the
scene of carnage He steps up to two pills of remains one
black and flesh colored covered with red blood the other a
heap of red and green cloth scarred tissues and pukish
green glop

Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits
the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air

Jacob sees something else and walks over to it Its Scotts
body Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager

JACOB
Im sorry Scott

A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up Over to the now-
silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the
cement With a crumbling of granite Power Cop rises from
the earth

Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns then SCREAMS
Sound Cops headless body walks into the shot his arms held
ABOVE FRAME over his neck

Then Sound Cops arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his
stump push it down twist it til it stays With great
effort Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth

Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else something that
REALLY makes his eyes widen We get to see the shadow of
what Jacob sees projected on the wall of the bar behind him

The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop
begins to MOVE The pieces start to REFORM leg to torso
arm to shoulder head to neck The shadow on the wall rises
and we PULL BACK

Blade Cop stands across from Jacob whole again except for a
flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the
experience

Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police
step around him

JACOB (contd)
Okay Im impressed

Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girls face

BLADE COP
You shouldnt be

Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of
Freddy remains But theyre not remains anymore All thats
left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants

A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness
The other two Dream Police raise their visors looking

equally distraught They all face Jacob

BLADE COP (contd)
This is what we were afraid of

SOUND COP
He still exists

JACOB
What How

POWER COP
Were already dead thats why he
couldnt destroy us

BLADE COP
But hes not dead Hes not alive either
Hes something in between

SOUND COP
Hes not entirely part of reality or part
of dreams Hes unique

BLADE COP
WE cant kill him

POWER COP
We can wail away on each other until
doomsday and not do any good

JACOB
Then whos going to kill this fucker

SOUND COP
YOU have to

JACOB
How the hell am I supposed to do that

BLADE COP
Kruegers power comes from his rage and
the souls of children

POWER COP
You have to find the original source of
that rage and use it against him

BLADE COP
This town in its present condition
encompasses all evils from all times in
its history The answer is here
somewhere

Jacob sighs then gets an idea

JACOB
I think I know where

And he starts to run down the street
BLADE COP
Jacob wait We have to find him first

JACOB
No time You guys find Karen

He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down
their visors

EXT ELM STREET HOUSE

Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down
building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation
This isnt just an ELM STREET house its THE Elm Street
house And for some reason Karen is drawn to it She looks
to her let at the bent mailbox

It has a name plate on it Another one underneath it And
another Its as if people moved in and out and instead of
changing the plates on the mailbox they just whacked a new
one over the old Karen steps closer to the mailbox

The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS She touches it
with her finger and it drops off the nails holding it on
rusted away to dust A new plate is revealed This one says
THOMPSON Karen picks lightly at it and it swings away The
name underneath makes Karen gasp

It reads KRUEGER

And theres still another one under that horrible name
Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off The last sign
reads UNDERWOOD

Karen frowns She turns back to the house a determined
expression on her face

KAREN
No more

She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house

INT ELM STREET HOUSE

Weve been here before havent we But for Karen its the
first visit as she opens the front door and walks in She
takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and
then begins to SEARCH it

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Karen races through pulling open desk drawers rifling
through shelves flipping through books She doesnt know
what shes looking for but she knows she hasnt found it

yet

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN
The intensity of Karens quest increases as she yanks open
cabinets and tosses plates to the floor Still nothing

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS

Karen runs up them a girl with a mission

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

Karen flings the door open Nothing but a bed and a set of
drawers No hint as to the occupants lives She doesnt
bother ransacking this one and goes on to

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDYS BEDROOM

Jackpot Karen stares through the open door at a childs
room a very twisted childs room She slowly walks in

A bed a desk a dresser Theres a Jack-in-a-box with its
head torn off A disemboweled Teddy Bear White puffy guts
hanging out of it A clown doll with its face caved in A
hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes

And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes

Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her
toe A small pair of pants about the right size for an
eight-year-old A black pair of shoes Anda little
sweater a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater

Karen goes over to the desk There is stack of drawings on
it - a childs drawings On one of them it looks like
someone was practicing writing their name FREDDY UNNERWOOD
FREDDY UNDERWUD FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again Until
the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out
replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER

Another piece of paper a set of human stick figures A
small one is labeled FREDDY The large one is labeled DADDY
he Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure

There are more drawings all of them violent the large
figure beating away at the small one

Suddenly a CREAKING Karen jumps Hides behind a bookshelf
Shes nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed
picture catches her attention on the shelf Its a picture
of a tall dark man and a little boy Karen reaches out to
grab the picture but accidentally knocks over a glass mug
with a CRASH

FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs

Someones coming and Karens on the edge of panic She looks
around and finds an old baseball bat She grabs it and runs
to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the
hallway Karen raises the bat

And Jacob appears Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob
jumps away from her

KAREN
Jacob You scared the shit out of me

JACOB
The feeling is mutual

KAREN
Where are the Dream Police

JACOB
I told them to look for you What are
you doing here Dont you know what this
place is

KAREN
I do now Look what I found

She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings

JACOB
Youve got to get out of here

KAREN
Wait You have to see this

JACOB
You dont understand The Police cant
kill Freddy They literally chopped each
other to pieces and hes still alive
Now Im supposed to figure out how to get
rid of him

KAREN
But I think I found the answer Shut up
for a second and look at these

She starts showing him the scrawlings

JACOB
Okay so hes a bad artist

KAREN
No You told me Kruegers mother
committed suicide and no one knows who
his father was right

JACOB
Yeah

KAREN
Freddys been pushing all our buttons
with our pasts These are HIS past
Dont you get it HE was a foster child
too

She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of
LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDYS FOSTER FATHER

KAREN (contd)
Someone had to have taken care of him
This guyhe was Freddys father Those
drawingsthey were Freddys childhood
This houseits where it all happened

JACOB
But in reality Freddy hasnt lived here
for decades

KAREN
Like you tried to tell me once before
this is a dream Who knows why this is
all here

JACOB
All evils from all times in history

KAREN
And isnt this where it all started in
Springwood On Elm Street

Jacob thinks for a second Its all starting to make sense

JACOB
But what does this do for us

KAREN
Theres got to be a way to use it against
him

JACOB

Okay but were not going to stand around
here to figure out how Its too
dangerous

He grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door

JACOB (contd)
Lets get out of this house

They head out to
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor The
two teenagers stop

JACOB (contd)
Thank God Freddys going to show up any
minute
KACHINK A knife shoots out of Blades right hand ready for
action (but wait a minute her uniform isnt ripped
anymore) Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs

He turns to Blade

JACOB (contd)
Where are the others

Blade walks up to him and stands there Then JAMS HER KNIFE
into JACOBS GUT Karen SCREAMS Jacob chokes Blade Cop
shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacobs
back She turns

Then BECOMES FREDDY

FREDDY
Time to join your mommy

Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacobs limp body
falls at Karens feet Karen shrieks and cries dropping to

her knees to hold him

KAREN
No no no no no no noJacob

He looks up at her slowly dying She strokes his forehead
while Freddy laughs at the sentiment

FREDDY
Young loveha

JACOB
Karendreampowers

And Jacob is gone Karen sobs so torn apart that she is
ignoring the incredible danger above her But not for long

Krueger grabs Karen by the neck

FREDDY
Its past your bedtime young lady

And he starts to DRAG her kicking and screaming her body
scraping across the floor towards the

MASTER BEDROOM

Freddy drags Karen in and TOSSES her across the room She
lands with a THUD on the bed He saunters over to her and
climbs up on the bed next to her Gets on top

Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and its
horrible because there he is pressing down on her right in

her face mounting her as if hes going to rape her

FREDDY (contd)
Aw sweetheart This wont hurt a bit
She screams as he presses even harder

FREDDY (contd)
Come on Be Daddys little girl

And the last three words of that sentence seem to ECHO
through the room swirling around Karen DADDYS LITTLE
GIRL Daddys little girl Karen twists her head away

And Freddys become Karens FATHER He looks down on her
with a lecherous grin

KARENS FATHER
Thats my baby Thats Daddys little
girl

Karen stops struggling The realization grows on her face
with the resurfacing memory

KAREN
Oh no

KARENS FATHER
(Freddys voice)
Now do you remember

She does And she has an answer for him

KAREN
Youre NOT my father

KARENS FATHER
But were going to have the same fun

Karen stares at him defiantly And a HAND grabs Karens
Father and yanks him away We PULL BACK

KARENS MOTHER is next to the bed Furious

KARENS MOTHER
Thats enough

And she SLAPS Karens Father He stands up SLUGS her across
the jaw She tumbles back Karen sits up

KAREN
Mommy no

Karens Mother gets up a defiant look just like Karens on
her face

KARENS MOTHER
Youre never going to touch her again

KARENS FATHER
Ill touch what I want

BAP He strikes her again sending her right out the door
He follows her Karen stands up and runs after them

IN THE HALLWAY

CRACK The man hits the woman down to the floor Karens
mother stands up just taking it Shes at the top of the
stairs Karens Father swings his arm back and Karen jumps
on him He shrugs her away violently

WITH KAREN

as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacobs body
She looks up

WIDER

And Karens Father is now FREDDY again He swings his fist
SMACK

Karens Mother reels from the hit falls backwards Karen
jumps up to try and help her reaching past Freddy But its
too late

Karens Mother tumbles down the stairs head hitting bones
cracking disappearing into darkness

Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her DANGLES her
over the top of the steps

FREDDY
Be honored bitch Youre the last soul
I need

And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger GRABS him Freddy DROPS
Karen She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy
turns his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacobs gut one
more time IMPALING him against the wall Jacob gasps out
his final breath

JACOB
Ill be back

FREDDY
Ill be waiting

Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall The boys
body hits the floor for the last time Freddy turns back to

the stairs and looks down them

FREDDY (contd)
Wheres my little pumpkin

He strolls down the steps
DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY
Freddy walks down and no ones there Karens Mom was just
an illusion but Karen herself dead or alive is nowhere to

be seen

FREDDY (contd)
Play time is over bitch

He walks down the hallway Eyes darting Until a BOOMING
VOICE is heard from the kitchen

VOICE
FREDERICK

Freddy cocks his head and frowns

VOICE (contd)
Frederick What have you done

And amazingly a look of FEAR crosses Kruegers face
Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of
the creature that fears nobody

Krueger turns to the kitchen door A man steps out of the
shadows a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his

eyes A man weve seen somewhere before - in a picture

Its FREDDYS FOSTER FATHER - MR UNDERWOOD And he looks
pissed beyond belief

Freddy shrinks back eyes widening

FREDDY
Daddy

MR UNDERWOOD
Dont you Daddy me

Mr Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the
skull Krueger tumbles back into the hallway

Freddy scrambles to his feet Shakes with dread Looks like
a scared little boy Mr Underwood advances on him

FREDDY
No Daddy Please

Freddy turns and bolts for the front door He flings it
open Power Cop stands in his way and SHOVES Freddy back -
back in front of his foster father

PUNCH - a vicious blow from Underwood sends Krueger into

THE LIVING ROOM

where Freddy falls over a couch Underwood stomps into the
room Krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading
into the dining room

BLADE COP blocks the escape The ripped flap of her uniform
proving shes the real one She KICKS Freddy back and into
Underwoods hands The man picks up Krueger and HITS him
again And again And again

FREDDY (contd)
Stop Youre hurting me Stop

Freddy wriggles away and opens a window Sound Cop fills the
window cutting him off Pushes him back inside

Mr Underwood grabs Krueger and slaps him over and over
Slugs him Gives the beating hes got coming to him

And Freddy MOANS and YELLS like a blubbering child Shrinks
into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling

Power Cop stands at the exit to the hallway Blade Cop
continues to obstruct the dining room arch Sound Cop steps
through the window and stands in front of it The Dream
Police just stare in silence

Its not a street fight not a punching match Just a
ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it werent
for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in
history has ever deserved it more

Underwood stops the whipping and stands over Krueger who is
lying on the ground whimpering pleading for mercy

FREDDY (contd)
Why Daddy What did I do

MR UNDERWOOD
You took some things that dont belong to
you

And with that Underwood brings his fist down and JAMS it
into Freddys stomach Right THROUGH IT Shoving it into
his very body

Freddy SCREAMS Underwood violently pulls his fist out and
theres SOMETHING in it A shimmering flowing thing
Crackling with unworldly LIGHT Its a SOUL Its Wesleys
SOUL Underwood flings his arm out and lets go Wesleys
soul flies into thin air and DISSIPATES

Kruegers father brings his hand down again and RIPS out
GINAS SOUL Again JACOBS SOUL Freddy opens his mouth
and shrieks As Underwood raises his arms and begins to
SPARKLE FLASHES of light bounce around his body Hes
changing

And somethings happening to Freddys too Steam is rising
from the creature His feet are starting to flatten as he
lays on the ground and BLACK GOO oozes from his pores

Hes melting And still screaming as he watches his foster
fathers image turn into

KAREN An aura of LIGHT vanishes around her body as she
lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face
Freddy DIES

A look of horrified realization burns in Kruegers eyes as he
sees Karen and CONTINUES to scream inhumanly

His body dissolves all of it liquefying into BLACK SLIME
Gone Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left His
SHRIEK echoes through the room and everywhere else

Then the GUNK grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins
to EXPAND

Power Cop runs up grabs Karen and yells

POWER COP
We gotta get outta here

Karen almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in
front of her stumbles away with Power Cop

EXT ELM STREET HOUSE
The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run
down the street as a RUMBLE joins Freddys thunderous SHRIEK

and the entire town begins to SHAKE

We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations
continue

And the Elm Street House EXPLODES The BLACK CLOUD punches
out the roof and the walls sending wood and debris flying

everywhere

The rubble flies into the air hangs there for a beat then
falls to the ground

All is SILENT And the dark cloud turns WHITE The milky
fog spreads out

EXT ELM STREET INTERSECTION

Karen falls to her knees on the pavement not looking back at
the destruction one block away

The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her Karen
hangs her head and cries

Blade steps forward
BLADE COP
It took a human touch It took knowing
HIS nightmare Goodbye Karen

Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away
KARENS POV - THE DREAM POLICE

walk off into the distance Just as they are about to vanish
into the darkness a FOURTH FIGURE appears and joins them in
formation Then they all disappear

ANGLE ON KAREN

Her mouth drops open at what shes just seen What she
DOESNT see is the white cloud swooping down the street
behind her She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist
envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE

FADE IN FROM WHITE TO
EXT PARK BENCH - DAY

Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees
Her eyes open and squint at the bright light She sits up
and tries to get her bearings Some hair falls into her face
and she brushes it away Only then noticing that shes
holding something in her hand

She opens her hand and looks down
KARENS POV

Its an ID bracelet A band of gold with a larger plate
dangling from the middle of it Karens hand turns it over
This time the printing reads JACOB

WITH KAREN

she chokes back the tears We hear a PANTING OS Then a
womans voice

WOMAN
You okay honey

Karen looks up as we PULL BACK A pleasant-looking woman no
longer a mutant is walking her cute dog She looks
sincerely concerned Karen nods

KAREN
Yes Im alright

WOMAN
Ive never seen you around Are you new

in town

KAREN
Sort of

WOMAN
Well then
(she smiles)
Welcome to Springwood

The woman continues on her way Karen sighs and puts the
bracelet on her wrist She stands and our SHOT PULLS UP AND
AWAY as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town
shes never seen - except in her dreams

FADE OUT
