Founding the corner John comes upon 4 T-3 with its back
armed John quickly spins around feet iosing traction on
tne polished concrete floor The T-i about-faces and levels
its chain gun

Zohn (carrying Ribberdy) ducks around the corner bullets
iraLling him

TUCSE ON THE T-1

“we see it fully assembled for the first time Strapped to

its back is a bulky bullet-proof AMMO PACKS -- 100 feet of

selt-fed CASELESS AMMO coiled densely allowing a seemingly
endless supply of gunfire

Mounted to its arm is a sleek CHAIN GUN An AUTO-AIM gun
Darrel pivots in sync with the T-l’s line of sight When it
turns its head the gun tracks with precision aim

The T-1 rounds the corner and levels its chain gun at John
But John beats the robot to the punch blasting the M-16 at
its robotic head

The T-1 is thrown off balance from the onslaught Unable to
right itself the robot stumbles John keeps firing until
CLICK Out of ammo

The T-1 finds its center of gravity and levels its chain gun
Sohn charges the robot and latches onto its (weapon) arm
forcing it off target

WHACK The T-1 backhands John across the face But John
Rangs on tight WHACK Another backhand sends John reeling
across the floor

The T-1 approaches John-and levels its chain gun to kill

TINK TINK TINK Three magnetic grenades fired at the back
of T-1 stick to its shoulder KA-BLAM The T-1’s (weapon)
arm is blown off

As the T-1 collapses we RACK FOCUS on Sarah who stands with
an HK69 40MM grenade launcher in her arms Needless to say
vohn is happily surprised

Suddenly the T-1 flops toward John on its back and grabs his
leg John kicks the robots head struggling to escape its
