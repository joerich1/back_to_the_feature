PRE-TITLE SEQUENCE 1

A glacial ice cover stretches for miles The last frontier
on earth is a harsh land of snow and ice WE MOVE CLOSER

Creeping slowly over a graveyard of skeletal remains Bones
and shards of bones protrude from the snow like small flags
And beyond those bones lies blood darkly rich in color
soaking deep into the once pristine snow This is fresh
blood

A BARN or a structure resembling a barn lives on the edge of
the sea covered in snow and surrounded by enoxmous tabular
icebergs This structure has been bruised by the hands of
time the weight of endless falling snow that gathers on its
roof and the wicked wind of this the coldest place on earth
SMOKE pours from a chimney

Antarctica - 1904

EX WHALING STATI T - DAY 2

The “barn” building is surrounded by two smaller buildings on
a narrow street in this tiny shack of a town JIMMY all of
nineteen frantically runs down the street He’s running as
if something is chasing him but we don’t see anything except
the terror on his face He’s freezing to death dressed in
only a t-shirt and jeans His hands and arms resemble frozen
sausages They are wickedly frostbitten The veins on his
arms look like long thin rivers His face is a deep rich
frosted blue He hears something Stops He looks in horror
as he sees BLOODY HANDPRINTS frozen into the snow

Jimmy‘s eyes follow the trail of bloody handprints to a small
building On the window are MORE BLOODY HANDPRINTS A pane of
glass is shattered Jimmy runs into the main building

INT BOUVETOYA WHALING STATION — DAY 3

ACRID SMOKE pours from the BLUBBER COOKERY BOILERS and
MACHINERY run loudly A HUMPBACK WHALE sits on the flensing

plan gutted MEAT and BONE are being GROUND DOWN in a COPPER
CAULDRON

Jimmy runs over the bloodstained floor frantically Looking
over his shoulder He falls over several barrels of whale

oil He picks himself up looks over his shoulder and starts
running again

Hanging from hooks on the wall are bloody HARPOONS LANCES
and LOUCHETS Jimmy crashes into them He falls He’s on the
ground now Exhausted Freezing And now badly cut up

And then he hears it The sound of his pursuer a sound like
a thousand mice being fed into a fire But there’s nothing to
see because nothing is there But that horrible sound grows
louder as it draws closer to him

INT ING 5 pa SS HALL —- DAY 3A

Jimmy runs into the mess hall Forty bowls and drinking jugs
sit on the long empty tables prepared for a crew of forty men
that are long gone

A slow but constant drip falls from the ceiling onto the
center table It looks like water but then Jimmy sees that
it‘s BLOOD Bloody human handprints are on the ceiling thirty
feet high How the hell did they get there Then

FOOTSTEPS TOO LOUD and too big to be human It’s as if a
giant had boulders for feet and was stalking through the
whaling station -- methodically taking each step its
movements louder than even the machines

The footsteps stop They’re very close Jimmy’s eyes do a
scan of the entire room but nothing is there Slowly Jimmy
turns around to find himself in the AWESOME SHADOW OF AN
ALIEN He looks up in horror He falls over a table bench
He‘s on the ground Hes on his back He’s helpless The
SHADOW OF THE ALIEN spreads over Jimmys terrified face

AN ALIEN en only in t of a few frames nearly
subliminal imagery The Alien lowers down inches from
Jimmys face The TWIN MOUTHS open and prepare to strike

SUDDENLY AN OPTICAL BLUR and the Alien is hit with tremendous
force He‘s knocked backward And now its the Alien that
falls to the ground itself badly wounded Blood drips from
the Alien onto the floor and melts right through it

REFLECTED ON JIMMY‘’S EYES we only GLIMPSE what he sees a
hunter stepping from the shadows It’s humanoid in shape but
clearly not of this earth A PREDATOR glimpsed in a
millisecond The footsteps Jimmy heard were his

PREDATOR VISION Jimmy is outlined in heat signature But
the Predator is not interested in him He wants the Alien
JIMMY is frozen with fear

JIMMY
Please Don’t I‘msorry

TWIN BLADES are fired from the Predator‘s wrist Their razor-
sharp edges catching the early-morning Light

Dark void For a moment everything is totally black Then
light begins to creep onto the SCREEN It slowly illuminates
what seem to be giant black spider legs They are almost
metallic in appearance For a moment any fan would be
forgiven in thinking that this was an ALIEN QUEEN

But as the light grows we see that the legs belong to an
orbiting SATELLITE We are in space 50 miles above an
unidentified planet As the Sun rises above the planet it
illuminates the globe and we begin to see the familiar green
and blue of -- EARTH

Suddenly THE CAMERA races forward - INTO the satellite We
streak through a complex web of circuitry coming to rest at
last by a large glass LENS The satellite is one giant
camera aimed towards the Earth And itss taking photographs

We see the imagery but very distorted Something on the

The floor RIPPLES revealing itself to be a pool of black
liquid and not the shiny floor we first imagined The ripple
is so subtle at first that we forgive ourselves for this rush
to judgement

It RIPPLES again And now slowly something is emerging from
this black pool A BLACK STATUE of some kind rising from
its sleep attached to the central machine by a LONG TUBE

Then ANOTHER emerges And ANOTHER And still ANOTHER
Until there are

THREE OF THESE TERRIFYING BLACK STATUES Their bodies are
bathed in a thick jelly-like goo And the bizarre LETTERING
is SUPERIMPOSED over their dark figures

A LOUD DEAFENING HISS pierces the room as one by one the
THREE STATUES’ tube-like lifelines are dropped releasing
them from their sleep and from their attachment to the

A giant black cauldron dominates the harbor Fifteen feet
high thirty feet across One of its four feet has been
knocked away and it tilts over at a crazy angle Only the
fact that it is frozen solid stops it from tumbling into the

Miller enters the frozen mess hall -- the same frozen mess
hall that Jimmy tried to flee from a hundred years ago It’s
an eerie sight Like some kind of frozen doll house The
tables are covered with sheet ice Cups plates spoons and
forks are frozen to the spot they were left since 1904
Miller tries to pick up one of the cups but the handle breaks
off into his hand

And as he realizes this there is MOVEMENT

not alone here

wrong Right now he needs to believe he was wrong Then the

across the floor fhe sound of an ALIEN FACE HUGGER getting
Closer Sheepish Miller recalls the toughest words he’s
ever heard and uses them as best he can

definitely moving behind one of the tables And it’s getting
closer Much closer

Sebastian Hes flushed and excited

SEBASTIAN

He leads them around the corner of the mess hall to reveal --
A GAPING HOLE in the snow and ice Perfectly round Ten
feet across Sebastian and the rest of the team are
gathering around the hole Off to one side is Quinn‘s

think about your life and how
youre going to be remembered You
know what I realized would happen

Sebastian desperately try and grab him but they both just
miss

Lex sees Weyland coming as we see just how fast her reflexes
are She pins Weyland against the tunnel wall holding him
in place by driving an ICE AXE into the ice preventing him
from falling further down into the tunnel

chains of incredible tensile strength run from the ceiling
and down into the vapor pool disappearing from sight

And around the Alien Queen is built a grotesque MACHINE in
which she is being held prisoner A complex web of pipes and
tubes which pierce her body in a hundred different places
She is literally part of the machine the ultimate BIO-
MECHANICAL synthesis This machine which holds the Alien
Queen prisoner is clearly of Predator design for it has all
the familiar TECHNO-MEDIEVAL features It could almost be
some giant gothic torture device from the Inquisition

As the chains continue to’ lift the Alien Queen into the air
we see that these shackles are attached to her every limb
There are even holes punched through the “crown” above her
head through which chains run The lifting chains LOCK into
place leaving the Alien Queen suspended in mid-air hanging
above the floor of the chamber like some great DRAGON caught
in flight

Its a stunning terrifying image

CLOSE ON THE ALIEN QUEEN unmoving Her head covered in a
thin sheet of ice Residue of the freezing vapor in which
she has been stored

SUDDENLY THE ICE BEGINS TO CRACK

Without warning the twin mouths of the Alien Queen shoot out
and begin to snap at the air She is waking up Her whole
body struggles and strains against the chains But in vain
Despite her immense size and incredible strength she is a
prisoner here

CLOSE ON THE EGG SACK below the Alien Queen held firmly in
Place by the Predator machine that surrounds her Almost as
soon as the Alien Queen awakes she begins to lay eggs

Beneath the egg sack is an automated CONVEYOR BELT which
takes the eggs away from the Alien Queen She lays every
fifteen to twenty seconds feeding the conveyor with a steady
stream of eggs We now see that the whole chamber is one
giant machine built to service the captive Alien Queen This
could be an image from BOSCH or BREUGEL

goes BERSERK straining against her chains to be free But
it is hopeless

Humanoid but not human Predator The distinctive TWIN
BLADES slide from the Predator’s wrist Quinn sees these
blades perfectly for the razor sharp edges are outlined with
the steaming blood of dead men

slices straight through it cutting his arm Quinn has
bought himself a few seconds He uses them to run

more bodies All strung up by their ankles completely
gutted Swaying in the wind Where their head used to be
long red ICICLES hang from the neck stump With horror
Quinn realizes that the icicles are frozen blood This is

The Predator knocks the gun out of Quinn’s hand We prepare
for a fight between the Predator and the one man who can
probably fight a Predator

Quinn charges the Predator but the Predator backhands Quinn
in the chest and he goes down hard Quinn is stunned by the
Predator’s awesome power

Quinn picks himself up and charges the Predator again He
lands two quick punches on the Predator but when he goes to
smash him with his elbow the Predator catches his arm and
snaps it in half like a twig The powerful Quinn goes down
on one knee reeling in pain

The Predator grabs him by the throat lifts him into the air
and throws him down the mouth of the tunnel Quinn screams

Quinn slides down the tunnel gaining speed every second

pulls out his ice axe and strikes it into the ice to slow
himself down Shards of ice spray everywhere

Quinn is holding his breath He can’t believe it as the
Predators walk STRAIGHT PAST him So close that he could
reach out and touch them After a moment Quinn cranes his
neck to see where the Predators are going He sees two

the tip of his sacrificial blade in the body of the Alien
Then holding the blade above the handle of her spear he
lets a drop of Alien blood fall The acid blood immediately
begins to eat its way through the handle of the spear

Next Scar holds the blade above the long piece of Alien hide

lets a drop of Alien blood fall The acid blood rolls
harmlessly off the Alien hide like it were just a drop of

ECHOING VOICE
Lex

It is coming from a cluster of STONE STATUES close by

ECHOING VOICE (CONT’D)
Lex

Lex advances on the statues Eyes straining to see in the
half light of the chamber

ECHOING VOICE (CONT’D)
- help me

Up ahead there is one statue in particular Some kind of

grotesque beast It seems impossible but the voice seems to
be coming from this statue

ECHOING VOICE (CONTD)
- help me Lex

Lex draws closer and only now does the horrific truth become
clear What Lex thought was a statue is alive And what she
thought was a beast is a man - Sebastian The Alien had
not killed him but instead encased him in some kind of
monstrous ALIEN COCCON

LEX
Sebastian

Sebastian is held tight in the cocoon In front of him an
EMPTY Alien Egg Hes clearly in a lot of pain

LEX (CONTD)
I‘ll get you out of here

SEBASTIAN
No Lex Listen to me

Sebastian suddenly convulses Weve seen this before Hes
ready to give birth to a Chest Burster

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
in unimaginable agony)
God it hurts
Scar appears at Lex’s shoulder

LEX
Its okay

Scar tries to pull her away from Sebastian

Get off me

Lex has already seen so many die Shes not about to lose
Sebastian But Scar knows that the human is doomed That
there is nothing Lex can do for him

LEX (CONT’D)
(struggling)
I have to help him

Scar pulls at her

LEX (CONTD)
Get off me

SEBASTIAN
NO Lex it’s too late You
have to stop these things

Sebastian SCREAMS in agony

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
Lex they can’t reach
the surface

Lex nods slowly

LEX
I know

His skin is starting to stretch tight An Alien Chest
Burster is about to break free Something that will haunt
Lex forever Without hesitation Scar targets his weapon

The three red dots of the laser sighting system appear on
Sebastian

LEX (CONT’D)
No

She blocks Scar‘’s shot

LEX (CONT’D)
No

Behind her Sebastian SCREAMS again Lex turns to face him

tears in her eyes She brings up Millers handgun that she
found

SEBASTIAN

She can see it in his eyes -- death would be a mercy

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
--- please

LEX
(softly)
I’m sorry

Lex closes her eyes and makes the impossible and unthinkable
choice to fire Her gun racks back as she just fired the
last bullet And we HOLD ON her eyes experiencing the
horror of this moment entirely from her tortured perspective
Sebastian’s agonized screaming comes to an abrupt end

Scar watches her closely From his reaction he appears to
respect her more and more with every decision she makes

SCARS PREDATOR VISION We see Sebastians dead body slumped

on the floor His body begins to convulse Sebastian’s skin
begins to distend

THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER leaps through the air With
lightening-fast reflexes Scar catches it

CLOSE ON SCAR as he holds the newly born Alien up to his
face He turns it in his hand examining it

CLOSE ON THE ALIEN Its teeth snapping at Scar‘s face
Unbelievably vicious Then in one simple move Scar casually
SNAPS its neck between his fingers Just like it were a
matchstick

INT PYRAMID — ALIEN QUEENS CHAMBER 114

The Alien Queen hangs from her chains a prisoner Slowly
dark figures emerge from the shadows of the chamber Aliens
Her children Led by Grid They almost seem to bow in
supplication to the Alien Queen Then as a group they LEAP
upon their mother Their claws and mouths TEARING at her
flesh in a frenzied attack The Alien Queen begins to bleed
Her hissing burning blood flying everywhere Her acid blood
begins to eat through the chains And only now do we realize
what the Aliens are doing --

They are not trying to kil their mother they are trying to
free her

The first of the Alien Queens limbs break free from the
weakened chains Then another then another Then Alien
Queen wounded but magnificent drops to the floor of the
chamber Free at last

(in a distorted version of
Lexs own voice)
Keep it together Make it to the

Scar presses several buttons on his wrist computer There
are several loud BEEPS A cluster of predator symbols
instantly appear on the wrist computer

Scar shows it to Lex She shakes her head

LEX (CONT‘D)
What What is this

He points to the wrist computer

Scar makes a tight fist with the hand that the wrist computer
is on Then he uses the opposite hand to point to the wrist

Lex looks back There is no sign of Aliens behind them They
are safe for now She finds herself face to face with Quinn

She almost screams in surprise Quinn‘s body is frozen solid
at the foot of the ice tunnel

Shaking off the surprise Lex sees that one of the large
equipment cases is still fastened to the automated winch and
pulley system Lex rips the top of the case off and flings
it away The empty case now resembles a SLED Lex grabs the
control box for the automated winch She shouts to Scar

LEX
Get in

But as Scar turns an Alien claw cuts into his shoulder
smashing his plasma gun AN ALIEN HAS MATERIALIZED OUT OF NO
WHERE THE ALIEN is hunched over Scar’s back A blur of
teeth and claws Lex sees the PITON GUN on the sled and
grabs it and shoves it into the Alien‘s mouth

LEX (CONTD)
Wrong girl

She pulls the trigger and blows the back of his head off

A second Alien “Grid” appears and rushes the sled Grid
smashes the piton gun Scar reaches for his throwing disc
and drives it into Grid’s crown wounding him badly Acid
blood pours from Grid‘s wounds splashing Scar and burning

through Scars armor Scar’s wounds are brutal but not
deadly

Grid and Scar are locked in deadly combat Grid is clawing

at Scar with blow after pounding blow Scar throws Grid
back against the wall of ice

Lex grabs Scar and they tumble back into the sled together

instead of a slow steady rise to the surface the sled takes

with a MASSIVE IMPACT Scar and Lex are thrown clear

Lex lands HARD in the snow The katabatic storm rages around
her prone figure but Lex is oblivious She has been knocked
unconscious by the impact

Sear is already back on his feet Oblivious to the open
wound in his shoulder He strides back to the mouth of the
tunnel and looks within

Far below the Alien Queen is ascending the tunnel Razor

The massive underground explosion throws Lex to her knees
A GIANT SHOCKWAVE shudders through the snow AND THEN THE

GROUND BEGINS TO GIVE WAY The entire ice cave and Pyramid
beneath them has started to collapse

AvP Draft September 26 2003 92

The mouth of the tunnel and everything around it is sucked
down into the bowels of the Earth The drilling rigs the
base camp all swallowed from view

But the collapse is spreading outward like ripples in a
pond It is starting to consume the whaling station
Building after building is sucked into the abyss Scar
forces Lex to her knees as the snow and ice around them
starts to CRACK and give way No matter how fast they run
however the cracks are already spreading ahead of them

Then the very ground beneath their feet begins to give way

Scar and Lex make one last desperate JUMP as the earth
literally DISAPPEARS beneath them

EXT RAZORBA POINT — 5) MOMENTS Tr 128
CLOSE ON LEX -- lying in the snow looking up at the sky
Above her towers the Separator -- the giant vat for boiling

whale blubber that she and Sebastian once discussed

LEX rolls over to see - She and Scar are lying on the very
edge of a GIANT CRATER Half the whaling station is gone
All that remains are smashed timbers the iced-over harbor
and the Separator It is the only piece of structure left
standing intact Lex struggles to her knees It‘s hard to
see the full expanse of the crater through the katabatic
storm but it’s vast Far below lie the wrecked timbers of
the whaling station Scar stands beside Lex He too has
survived

The SNOW around them HISSES and melts where chunks of Alien
carcass have landed One of these chunks looks familiar
Its a piece of Grid’s head -- his signature pattern clearly
visible Scar leans down and picks something up He carries
it over to Lex She is still dazed and it takes a moment
for her to realize what is happening Scar holds an Alien
finger still dripping acid blood rightin front of her
face Lex tenses in pain but makes no sound as the
Predator begins to “blood” her Burning the distinctive
Predator warrior scar into Lex‘s forehead with the acid blood
of a dead Alien

She has earned the mark of a warrior

THE CAMERA begins to PULL BACK and the MUSIC SWELLS We are
left with the classic image of two tiny figures in a vast
landscape The last survivors

SUDDENLY BEHIND THEM THE ALIEN QUEEN BURSTS FROM THE SNOW

AvP Draft September 26 2003 93
128

None of her brood have survived but the mother lives and
she’s out for blood

THE ALIEN QUEENS TAIL whips around smashing into Scar
flinging him into the remnant of the whaling station Scar
survives the impact and falls to the ground as we see chunks
of smashed concrete flying in the air

THE ALIEN QUEEN closes in on Scar to finish him off but then
plasma shells fire past her blowing chunks off the Alien
Queen’s crown PULL BACK to reveal LEX FIRING

THE ALIEN QUEEN turns to face her Lex has to duck to avoid
a CHAIN as it whips above her head Many of the restraints
that had held the Alien Queen prisoner are still attached to
her body And as she moves her limbs these chains flail
around her like giant steel WHIPS

Lex lines up to shoot again But this time one of the chains
catches her plasma gun sending it flying into a bank of deep
snow by the separator

LEX recovers quickly desperate and cold She runs toward the
snow bank to try and get the gun back Behind her emerging
from the fury of the storm is the Alien Queen chasing after
her at top speed

LEX desperately digs into the snow bank in a futile search
for her gun Lex is helpless A sitting duck for the Alien
Queen

THE ALIEN QUEEN is about to impale Lex when she rolls
underneath THE SEPARATOR It sits six feet off the ground
and it is a complex web of metal wood support

THE ALIEN QUEEN starts smashing through them using her claws
and tail

LEX is narrowly avoiding the tail smashing in and out of the
separator The Alien Queen smashes another support beam
causing THE SEPARATOR to drop three feet instantly nearly
crushing Lex

Lex finds a moment and escapes from underneath the separator
She runs toward the Whaling Station

INT REMNANTS OF WHALING STATION 129
LEX runs into the dilapidated whaling station and hides in

between two walls where the insulation sits She is cold and
the insulation helps keep her warm

AvP Draft September 26 2003 94

The space is very narrow very long and very claustrophobic
She has just a moment to catch her breath when

THE ALIEN QUEEN’S TAIL smashes through the wall next to Lex’s
head almost impaling her

Lex falls to the ground as

THE ALIEN QUEENS TAIL smashes through the wall next to her
leg narrowly missing her

THE ALIEN QUEEN moves her head into one of the holes she
smashed looking for Lex

LEX scrambles out of the walls barely escaping just as the
Alien Queen rips another hole into the wall She emerges from
the whaling station

SCENE 130 HAS BEEN DELETED 130
EXT RAZORBACK POINT - HARBOR 131

Lex finds one of the LONG CHAINS still attached to the queen
and works quickly to get the chain of the Alien Queen around
the separator She is pushing at the one weakened support
that stops the Separator from tumbling into the harbor below
The one weakened leg of the Separator finally gives wayas

THE SEPARATOR tumbles down the hill The chain PULLS TIGHT
and DRAGS the Alien Queen with it It hits the pack ice

covering the harbor It cracks the ice but doesn’t break
through completely

THE ALIEN QUEEN is dragged to the edge of the harbor and it

brings her closer to Lex but not into the freezing depths
below

A hundred feet below lie the broken remnants of the whaling
station - now transformed into a forest of sharp wooden

stakes thrusting up into the air To fall on these would be
instant death

ON THE SEPARATOR as a spiderweb of cracks spread out through
the pack ice The ice is weakening breaking up but not
fast enough

THE ALIEN QUEENS CLAWS slash past they rake through Lex’s
clothing

blow

The Alien Queen leans down Her face hovering inches from
Lex’s Her jaws open revealing the inner mouth Ready to
strike Lex closes her eyes

CLOSE ON A PREDATOR DISC as it arcs through the storm and
impacts with the Alien Queen The Alien Queen HOWLS in pain
The disc has embedded itself in an open wound - where the
explosion had torn a hole in her armor The Alien Queen
thrashes around in pain attempting to dislodge the Predator
throwing disc Eventually she succeeds and the furious
Alien Queen turns to face the culprit Scar stands in a
Samurai pose Ready for battle With one hand he motions
for the Alien Queen to begin

SCAR AND THE ALIEN QUEEN FACE OFF There’s something medieval

‘about the image An armored knight facing off against some

mythic dragon While around them an apocalyptic storm rages

THE ALIEN QUEEN AND SCAR CIRCLE The Alien Queen stabbing
with her tail Scar parrying with his spear Scar cuts
through the Alien‘s defenses and drives his spear deep into
her side For a moment there is a feeling of triumph But
it is short lived The Alien Queen STABS Scar with her TAIL
IMPALING him and lifting him clear off the ground The Alien
Queen studies him for a moment then with a violent flick
she sends Scar flying He’s badly injured

THE ALIEN QUEEN advances on the prone Scar closing in for
the kill He tries to stand but he’s never going to make
it

LEX appears at the Predator’s side The spear fashioned from
an Alien tail firmly in her hands For a glorious moment she
and Scar fight side-by-side

uy Predato nit against thi timate Alien threat

Their actions are heroic but futile They cannot defeat THE
ALIEN QUEEN as she begins to TEAR THEM APART It’s only a
matter of time a very short time before Lex and Scar are
destroyed

The towering Alien casts a giant shadow across Lex With
lightning speed she suddenly moves DIVING UNDER the Alien
Queen’s CLAWS she rolls forward pulls out her knife that
she made from the Alien‘’s tail and stabs the Alien Queen a
few times causing the acid blood of the Alien Queen to spill
out

JHE ALIEN QUEEN attacks with her claws and Lexs knife is
knocked away

Lex now only has the shield she made with Scar to protect her
and it won’t protect her for long

THE ALIEN QUEEN’S acid blood narrowly misses Lex and strikes
some concrete on the separator melting right through it
What it would have done to Lex is unthinkable Her shield is
a battered and bruised mess She won’t be able to keep the
Alien Queen back much longer - She rolls out and narrowly
escapes

SCAR flings his Predator Spear high into the air Its a
seemingly insane move -- giving up his only weapon But then
the spear begins to descend toward the ice With perfect
accuracy the spear lands WITHIN the deepest of the cracks
The impact is just enough and with a massive GROANING SOUND
the pack ice finally breaks up But Scar is now defenseless

and the Alien Queen pins him to the ground with one mighty
blow

THE SEPARATOR slips through the ice and is sucked into the
water below The chain PULLS TIGHT Dragging the Alien
Queen off the prone body of Scar The Alien SCREAMS in
protest but there is nothing she can do She smashes
through the remnants of a building and is dragged into the
harbor by three tons of solid iron

Scar lies in the snow A fallen warrior Bloodied and
broken but dying with honor Lex cradles his head in her
hands

Scar reaches out and touches Lex’s forehead His movement
are gentle for such a big creature He traces the Predator
warrior scar marked into her flesh

Then Scar dies

For a moment the storm seems to reduce in fury The sky
clears to reveal the PREDATOR SPACECRAFT hovering directly
above the remnants of the whaling station On a low rise
overlooking the battleground stand a DOZEN PREDATOR ELDERS
They had been watching all along MULTIPLE SHADOWS cast
seemingly from nowhere play over Lex and Scar Then four
More PREDATORS become visible They pick up Scar’s body and
carry him toward a long ramp leading up to the belly of the
spacecraft

Lex faces off against A DOZEN PREDATORS She’s ready for
battle She doesn’t care She‘ll take them all on For a
Moment there is a tense standoff A PREDATOR ELDER stares at
the Human Woman He sees the distinctive Predator warrior
scar on her forehead The same scar that he and all the

others wear Then he nods in RESPECT As the rest of the
Predators file back onto the Spacecraft the Predator Elder
hands Lex his SPEAR The gesture has the feeling of ancient
ceremony about it The message is clear’ -

LEX IS NOW A HUNTER

Lex takes the spear And the Predator Elder turns back to
the Spaceship As he turns he shimmers and becomes
invisible The MAIN THRUSTERS of the Predator Craft are
starting to fire up Intensifying the snowstorm beneath the
ship

Lex is covered in blood and bruises holding the warriors
spear and maxked with the Predator warrior scar Lex has
never looked more formidable She seems more Predator than
Human She watches the Spacecraft as it rises into the

heavens becoming lost in the storm in a matter of moments

Lex takes something from her pocket It‘s Sebastian‘s bottle
cap She turns it over in her hand the emotion of the

moment clear

Lex looks up to the heavens A break in the storm reveals a
giant FULL MOON hanging in the sky
