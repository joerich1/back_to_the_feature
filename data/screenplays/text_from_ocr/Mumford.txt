SHOOTING DRAFT

EXT MAIN STREET SMALL TOWN - DAY

A freight truck of late 1950s

the road in a small rural town

gets out of the passenger side
NEWCOMER carries his coat over
suitcase

hes got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour
shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps

vintage pulls to the side of
A handsome well-built man
and thanks the Driver THE
his shoulder and a beat-up
his
He

wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around
Until noted below this section of the movie is in BLACK and
WHITE

FOLLETT (V0)
I get outta the truck in this two-
bit town I got no money and no
prospects What I need right now is
a stiff drink a cold shower anda
hot broad Ill take em in any order
they come

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling
picket fence and a scruffy yard The sign says -- ROOMS TO
RENT The Newcomer goes in the gate

FOLLETT (VO)
Oh yeah one other thing I need --

an angle

He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing
then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood

FOLLETT (V0)
I was thinking -- if it werent for
bad luck I wouldnt have any luck
at all

LANDLADY (0S)
Can I help you

The Newcomer turns toward the door Standing there holding
the screen open is the LANDLADY Shes a knockout in a cheap
small-town way a cotton dress that buttons down the front
and clings with sweat to her generous curves

FOLLETT (V0O)
Either my luck had just changed or
Fate just bought me another round of
trouble

INT BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

The Newcomers POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the
narrow gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third
story attic She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk We
can barely HEAR her DISTANT ECHOEY DIALOGUE

LANDLADY
-not very fancy house needs
repairs We havent had a man around

here for so long

FOLLETT (VO)
She kept yammerin the whole time
but her hips were doing all the
talking

The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs
and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed bureau and

tiny window The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous
body to get inside and look around It doesnt take long

His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the
door chest thrust forward He focusses on her fingers toying
with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage

FOLLETT (V0)
It couldnt a been any clearer what
the set-up was The next move was up
to me

The Newcomer takes a step in the Landladys direction --

MUMFORD (V0O)
Dont tell me

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY
CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing

MUMFORD
(softer)
-- Thats all the time we have
Sorry
(indicates his watch)
next time

We see Mumfords office the office of a Psychologist a
therapist with a doctorate Its modest comfortable neat
with a calm relaxed ambience The movie is now in COLOR
His patient HENRY FOLLETT looks nothing like The Newcomer
in the soft-core fantasy hes been narrating Instead hes
a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding
hairline Only the voice is the same its as studly as his
fantasy alter-ego Follett has been lying on a couch but
now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford

FOLLETT
I have eighteen more minutes

MUMFORD
I dont want to hear any more today

FOLLETT
Why not

MUMFORD
Mr Follett do you trust me or dont
you

FOLLETT
Well I dont know I only been
seeing you --

MUMFORD

Without trust theres no point to
any of this You might as well not
come

FOLLETT
Now hold on I didnt say I didnt
want to come --

MUMFORD
Good then go

INT LILYS CAFE- DAY

Lunch crowd Mumford can be seen out the big front window
crossing from the two-story building that houses his office
on the main drag of this small town which oddly enough is
also called Mumford He comes inside and goes to the counter
to pick up some take-out The Proprietor is a woman around
forty named LILY who talks to him as she works

LILY
Youre early its not ready What

MUMFORD
My patient had to leave early

A Patron passes on the way out

PATRON

LILY

MUMFORD
Oh I dont know

LILY
Four months two and a half weeks --

(Mumford gives her a
look)
And youve already got more patients
than those other two shrinks combined

MUMFORD
Lily I dont think even you could
know that --

Lily sees something out the window

LILY
Look at that guy

Mumford turns to look out the window A young man of about
30 in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt is skateboarding down the
street at high speed weaving in and out amongst the cars
He zips past the front of the restaurant

LILY
You know who that is dont you
(Mumford does not)

You really dont Thats Skip

Skipperton man He gets himself hit

by a truck this whole town shuts

down

MUMFORD
Oh so thats him The Panda Man

LILY hands over Mumfords bagged order rings it up Back on
track

LILY
So what makes you so popular Whats
your secret

MUMFORD
(takes his bag to go)
You like me How come

LILY
Not sure Let me think about it

Mumford is smiling as he goes out Another Patron LIONEL
DILLARD a lawyer brings his check to Lily watching Mumford
cross the street Lily cant stand this guy

LIONEL
Thats the new psychiatrist

LILY
Psychologist Hes not medical

LIONEL
Probably thinks hes pretty smart

Lily gives him a look as she takes his money
INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

An overweight teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on
Mumfords couch She fidgets as she talks and cant decide
whether to lie down (so shes looking away from him) or sit

up and face him She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps
taking out a lighter then stuffing it back in her big sloppy
handbag

NESSA
Sso he already had the tattoo that
said Naomi Forever and now

theyre broken up see and he has
to have it removed But while the
scar is still healing or whatever
you call it when you have a tattoo
removed he meets Chandra And its
serious immediate love So in no
time hes gone from the most gorgeous
model in the world to the most
gorgeous actress in North America

MUMFORD
What do you mean in no time

NESSA
In maybe three or four issues

MUMFORD
Weekly or monthly

NESSA
Monthly God how shallow do you
think Brad is Why do I waste my
time telling you this stuff

MUMFORD
Why do you think you tell me Nessa

NESSA
Dont do that thing
(Mumford what)
that shrink thing

MUMFORD
Its a big part of the show

She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter
but is afraid to actually break his rules

NESSA
You really need to let people smoke
in here you know Its perverse
What are they paying you to see me

Mumford indicates nothing

NESSA
The school board doesnt pay you
What kind of deal is that

MUMFORD
Its called pro bono

NESSA
Pro boner
(he waits her out)
Pro bono huh For whose good
supposedly

MUMFORD
Its my bit for the community

NESSA
Fuck the community
(he wont go for it)
There was this article my friends
and I read It was 25 Signs Hes
Great in Bed It was very
fascinating

MUMFORD
Where was this

NESSA
Where The New York Times The
first one was -- he handles produce

well Which we already knew

(an expression she

uses)
The point is you have a lot of the
signs

MUMFORD
You been spying on me in the
supermarket Nessa

NESSA
Have women found you attractive

Mumford laughs

NESSA

I knew you wouldnt answer Ive
been thinking about what you said
last time How me trying to lose
weight -- and constantly not -- is
like a lot of people with addictions
How maybe I cant lose the weight
ever

(quietly)
Which we already knew

MUMFORD
Thats not quite what I said --

NESSA
Its a really weird thing for a shrink
to say and then you said maybe

peopled be happier if theyd accept
that some things dont change --
that itd be some kind of a relief
or something

Mumford waits

NESSA
Well I guess Im just a dumb bitch
but how depressing is that moment --
the moment when you give up

EXT HIKING TRAIL MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC
The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees
as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well

EXT BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock settles himself on the
edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle

WHAT HE SEES far below at the foot of these hills lights
just twinkling on is the town of Mumford He stares at it
for several long moments Then he takes a small headlamp
from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks
like a miners light) He twists the light on to test it and
turns his head to watch the beam move about

WE CUT BACK WIDE After a beat Mumford settles back and
turns off the light

INT SCATTERGOODS TAVERN - NIGHT

The place is quietly busy with the regulars Mumford has a
favorite spot at the far end of the bar Right now hes
sitting alone reading the remnants of a newspaper

SKIP SKIPPERTON the man on the skateboard comes in Everyone
in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here Several patrons
greet him as he makes his way deeper inside looking around
Hes uncomfortable He seems relieved when he spots Mumford
and heads back there Mumford doesnt notice Skip waiting

for his attention

SKIP
Hi

Mumford looks up smiles Skip offers his hand

SKIP
Youre Doc Mumford
(Mumford nods)

Skip Skipperton

MUMFORD
How are you

SKIP
Fine Okay Pretty good Ive been
hoping wed meet Ive heard a lot
about you

Mumford waits friendly Skip runs out of gas gets uneasy
glances around

SKIP
Do you think we could Can I buy
you a drink
CUT TO

LATER IN A BOOTH near the back Theyve been at it a while
but nothing is clear to Mumford yet Skip keeps his voice
down he doesnt want anyone else in the bar to hear him

SKIP
Find the need and fill it my
dad used to say -- I guess a lot of

dads say that -- but I did and it
just took off

MUMFORD
No kidding Panda Whered that
come from

SKIP
Panda Ive always liked giant
pandas Ive been to China and
seen them in the wild Thats the
kind of thing I can do if I want
now I can do pretty much anything I
want to do these days

Skip stares into his beer for a moment as though the thought
depresses him He catches himself and snaps back --

SKIP
So now we make 23 of the modems in
the market which is pretty good

Skip glances around leans in confidential

SKIP

When I was growing up here the town
was about dead The timber business
was played out Panda changed all
that Now just about everybody in
town either works for the company or
depends on it somehow Which is kinda
the problem

Mumford waits watches Skip gets uncomfortable

SKIP
Would you like another beer

MUMFORD
Nah scotch

SKIP
(brightens like a
kid)
Far out Single malt
(gets up)
Can I pick it

Skip heads off to the bar Mumford looks around Everybody
is watching

DISSOLVE TO

LATER The bar crowd has thinned Both Mumford and Skip have
had a few In fact Mumford is now carefully pouring them
each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the
table

MUMFORD
You want me to be your friend

Skip beams Mumford leans forward in the same confidential
way Skip did before he indicates that Skip should lean in
too Mumford is almost whispering --

MUMFORD

But thats not whats really going
on

(Skip is excited)
Whats really going on is you
have some problems and you want some
therapy but you feel it could be
very bad for Panda Modem stock if
word got out that you were having
head problems

Skip confirms thats it

MUMFORD
Can I ask you a personal question

SKIP
Of course Thats exactly what I
want

MUMFORD
Have you thought about getting a
wife

Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large YES
but also total frustration and failure

SKIP
When Panda started to happen I was
dating women from New York San
Francisco LA They came out of the
woodwork Models actresses venture
capitalists These were not the
kind of girls who were interested in
me before I hit it And you know
what I discovered I discovered these
girls did not love me for myself
The majority of them didnt even
like me But a lot of them wouldve
gladly become Mrs Skipperton for a
while Can you imagine that --
marrying someone just because theyve
got money

Mumford considers that
SKIP

I gotta pee
(he gets up a little

wobbly)
Can I ask you something This town
is called Mumford Been that way
since 18 18-0 18-0

(finally remembers)
thirteen Right
(Mumford if you say
so)
Now heres the question -- Your name
is Mumford too

MUMFORD
Is that the question

SKIP
You moved here from back East and
your name is the same as this town
Is that right

(Mumford shrugs)
Far out

Skip takes a few steps toward the mens room then comes
back and leans down toward Mumford

SKIP
I hope you dont think I want you to
do this for free Just because were
gonna play it like were friends
doesnt mean I wont pay you like a
doctor

MUMFORD
I understand

SKIP
I have a lot of money Do you know
how much money Ive got

MUMFORD
Dont tell me ‘cause Im not going

to tell you what Ive got

SKIP
Ive got three big ones

MUMFORD
Im impressed I couldnt make three
million dollars if I lived three

lifetimes

SKIP
No no I have three billion
dollars

Skip stumbles off to take a leak Mumford takes a moment to
digest that Its difficult

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

Mumford is listening to Lionel the arrogant lawyer who asked
about him in the restaurant Lionel is lying on the couch
talking with enormous energy he has a serious superiority
complex Mumford cant stand him and the session seems to be
lasting an eternity

LIONEL
so Im watching Brokaw and theyve
got some astronomer this little
limey know-it-all and hes telling
how with this Himball telescope
theyve discovered there are maybe
400 million more galaxies than they
thought there were And I guess thats
supposed to make me feel small Im
supposed to feel insignificant Is
that the point Because I can tell
you it didnt

Mumfords eyes dart to look at --
THE CLOCK on the bookshelf 223
MUMFORD

Lionel since this is our first
session together maybe --

Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at
Mumford

MUMFORD

-- you can sit up and look at me if
youd like --

(Lionel waves that

off and looks away)
-- maybe it would be helpful if you
told me a little about what brought
you here

LIONEL
Kind of impatient for a big-time
headshrinker arent you How bout
you let me explain it my own way
As Lionel goes on Mumfords eyes again dart toward -- THE
CLOCK still 223 Hold on it Finally it moves Mumfords
eyes dart toward his desk --

A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur
stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthurs stone

LIONEL
and in the dream its always the
same I wake up in my room from when
I was I kid in Ohio and I realize
this is the day of the big exam at
school

Mumfords head rocks slowly back for a moment as if hes
going to drift off He snaps back to life and stares hard at
the top of Lionels head where there is a bald spot starting
to take hold The sound of LIONELS VOICE begins to echo --

LIONEL
-which is no problem for me because
I remembered it was coming and Ive
attended every class so Im totally
prepared Then I see myself running
down the hall at school

MUMFORDS GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionels bald spot to the
gleaming letter opener

Mumford closes his eyes We CUT TO

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A boy unmistakably the Young Lionel runs down the deserted
hallway toward a bright doorway LIONELS DREAM has a BLUE
TINT

LIONEL (V0O)
-but its not really my school --
and this is very interesting -- its
the school from the next district --

MUMFORD (V0O)
-- Go on

INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and
stares alarmed

LIONEL (V0O)
And even though I arrive a little
bit early everybodys already there
But the surprising part is --

WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES Everyone in the class including the
Teacher in the front is naked The Teacher holds out an
exam toward Young Lionel

LIONEL (V0O)
-- Im the only one whos prepared

CUT TO
INT WAITING ROOM MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

ALTHEA BROCKETT a woman in her forties sits on the couch
reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings There
are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed
woven carry-all

The door to Mumfords inner office opens with some force
Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel who
is getting up from the couch in some confusion

LIONEL
-- you crazy You cant do this

MUMFORD
Sure I can Lionel

LIONEL
Im a criminal lawyer -- you think I
like my clients I cant stand most
of them But I dont kick them out

MUMFORD
See that sign -- We retain the right
to refuse service to anyone Im not
going to charge you for this session
but I dont want to see you back
here

Lionel looks around but there is no such sign He does spot
Althea watching the show from the couch

LIONEL
Dont you at least have a back door
I can use

MUMFORD
Come out this way Theres no shame
in getting a little therapy is

there Althea

Althea stands up smiling She thinks Mumford is the bees
knees

ALTHEA
Not at all It takes guts Lionel

Lionel steams by them in a black mood

LIONEL
Maybe some of us dont need this
crap

MUMFORD
And its the Hubble Telescope not
the Himball Telescope

Lionel bangs out the front door Mumford motions Althea inside

MUMFORD
Jeez what an asshole

Althea heads inside giggling wildly She cant get enough
of this guy

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE -DAY

Althea is sobbing Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the
box next to the couch She wads it with her current one and
tries to stop crying Mumford settles back in his chair
patient

ALTHEA
What do they want from me
(more sobbing)
What have I done thats so wrong
(pulling it together)
They act as though they dont have

their own peculiar things They
do Believe me Everybodys got
something

(looks at Mumford)
Even you probably have things

MUMFORD
Me more than most

ALTHEA
Why are they ganging up against me

MUMFORD
Im not sure But I think theyre
worried about you

ALTHEA

Its the kids you know not Jeremy
He had nothing to do with this --
except pay of course Hes always
willing to pay Hes extremely
generous

(a long beat)
Im so humiliated that my own children
would threaten me

MUMFORD
How did they threaten you
ALTHEA
They said if I didnt get help they
wouldnt deal with me any more
(a beseeching look)
What do you think about that

MUMFORD
Good kids

Althea stares at him a long moment She knows hes right
Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks She grabs
another Kleenex In the midst of the torrent she tries to
talk but its undecipherable

ALTHEA
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm

MUMFORD
Hmm

Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face

ALTHEA

I said you must come out to the
house for dinner on Thursday

MUMFORD
Really You think so

ALTHEA
Yes Jeremy will be home for the
weekend And you can meet the kids

Mumford considers then nods his assent

EXT MUMFORDS STREET - MAGIC

street which rises out of the main business district seen
beyond Mumford

EXT THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes to the house where he lives He heads down the
driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment

The front yard is completely fenced Lily the owner of the
restaurant is almost visible in there working among the
greenery of a lush garden Her friendly dog AINGE sees
Mumford leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around
Mumford who has no free hand to pet him

MUMFORD
How ya doin Ainge Evenin Lily
LILY
Doc

Ainge

The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard Mumford hurries
up the stairs

INT MUMFORDS APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen
counter He goes directly to the table by his main chair and
picks up the TV remote He switches it on and changes the
channel The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just
beginning It previews the stories on that evenings episode

disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack
hosting

CLOSE ON MUMFORDS FACE as he watches Only when the whole
show has been previewed does he seem to relax He leaves the
show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the
bags

INT COOKS HARDWARE STORE - DAY

sixty-ish proprietor has been watching from a distance but

now --

COOK

MUMFORD
(doesnt really know
him)
Mr Cook
COOK

Mystified Mumford follows Cook through the door into the
back

BACK OF THE STORE Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat
of honor in the work area but Mumford prefers to stand
Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start Finally --

COOK

thing either

MUMFORD
Whys that

COOK

Cook nods but looks worried

COOK

MUMFORD
Generally that doesnt work out so

people who need to make a change

Cook is quick to agree he doesnt want to make waves But
hes worried

EXT MAIN STREET - DAY

Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-
foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder Folks greet him
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford who stops

MUMFORD
Hello Lionel

LIONEL
Youve got to have the right ladder

in trouble

MUMFORD
Youre right as usual See you

Mumford continues up the street We STAY WITH Lionel who
watches Mumford with a sour look then turns to enter a small
medical building

INT DR DELBANCOS OFFICE - DAY

DR ERNEST DELBANCO a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish
vanity hair and PHYLLIS SHEELER a psychologist in her
thirties sit on the doctors comfortable furniture
listening The remains of their take-out lunch is on the
coffee table They seem a little impatient with their as-yet-
unseen visitor --

LIONEL (0S)
completely inappropriate and highly
unprofessional Now I dont want to
presume to tell you how to run your
businesses --

SHEELER
-- practices

Lionel is sitting across the room making an ardent case --

LIONEL

-- Whatever Six months ago you two
were the only games in town The
value of your

(mocking)
practices could be seriously
undermined by this bozo A town this
size has only so many headcases to
go around

DELBANCO
What exactly would you have us do
Lionel

LIONEL

Protect your turf Check this guy
out I smell a rat I tell you

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look they find Lionel
distasteful

SHEELER
Mr Dillard Im sure Dr Delbanco
shares my gratitude for your concern
But I also know hed agree that you
misunderstand the nature of our
calling to mental health Were not
in some widget business trying
to crush our competition

LIONEL
What the hells a widget

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR DELBANCOS OFFICE - DAY

Lionel comes out of the office miffed and goes down the
stairs A moment later the door opens slightly and Delbanco
peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone He closes the door on
us

INT DR DELBANCOS OFFICE - DAY

Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at
Sheeler

DELBANCO
What an asshole

SHEELER
(agrees)
Ernest what do you think

DELBANCO
I think hes got a point

So does she
EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY

Idyllic The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by
lush woods Standing about forty feet apart Mumford and
Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and
forth For quite a while the only sounds are the birds the
wind and the regular SLAP of ball into glove Finally --
SKIP
This is great

SLAP SLAP

SKIP
This is exactly what I wanted

SLAP SLAP

MUMFORD
Skip you must have lots of people
you can throw a ball with

SKIP
Youd be surprised Most guys have
kids or wives or girlfriends Theyre
busy Its not as easy as you think

MUMFORD
Skip youre the head of the whole
deal here Are they busier than you

SKIP
Well you know thats the thing
Like I said just about everybody in
town works for me And its just not
the same asking someone to throw a
ball when they work for you Its

like an order or something And no
one -- no one -- asks me
Mumford considers SLAP SLAP SLAP
MUMFORD
So would you say were out here
let me think how to put this Is
your problem really that youre
lonely
SKIP

Dont you like this

MUMFORD
Hell yes I like it Whats better
than this Most guys would kill just
to have someone do this with them
whenever they like

SKIP
Okay then
(SLAP SLAP)
Have you got a lot of friends

MUMFORD
(nope)
Lily and I talk a bit You know Lily
runs the coffee shop

SKIP
No Ive seen her Good-looking
woman
MUMFORD
(agrees)
Shes probably ten years older than
you
SKIP
(SLAP SLAP)

Good-looking woman

MUMFORD
Lives downstairs from me Shes got
a great dog named for Danny Ainge

SKIP
(sparks to that)
Really Im the only person I know
that likes Danny Ainge outside of
Celtic fans Maybe Phoenix

MUMFORD
Well theres Lily

SKIP
Did you know that Danny Ainge was
drafted by the Blue Jays Do you
know what kind of athlete you have
to be to play in the NBA and in the
bigs

MUMFORD
Amazing

SKIP
Unbelievable
(SLAP SLAP)
And Lily named her dog after him
Far out

MUMFORD
What kind of person do you have to
be to do this

Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet
seen

SKIP
What

MUMFORD
This --
CUT TO

REVERSE ANGLE The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast
lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS a
brand new distinctively original high-tech office park
Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage it is
in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face black
eyes and ears round body

Skip is suddenly self-conscious embarrassed

SKIP
I wouldve traded any of it to have
made the Mumford High varsity

Mumford takes that in SLAP SLAP

SKIP
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient
of yours Hes my pharmacist

MUMFORD
Yeah
(SLAP SLAP)
Guys got some serious sex fantasies

Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford but he
just throws the ball

MUMFORD

Pretty good too Lots of detail
Nothing hard core Old-fashioned
ones from back when people cared
about atmosphere and character

SKIP

Uh-huh

MUMFORD
Problem is his fantasy lifes a lot
better than his real one Nothing
can live up to it His wife got sick
of it and left him Took his kids
with her

SKIP
I wondered what happened to her

Skip is fascinated but a little uncomfortable Mumford seems
oblivious unusually talkative --

MUMFORD
Of course its not that simple
Theres something powerful going on
there Weve got a lot of work to
do
(announcer voice)
Its hit to the warning track

For the first time Mumford throws the ball way high like a
long fly ball Skip delighted as a dog takes off running
and just barely catches it on the run He pegs it back to
Mumford

MUMFORD

In these fantasies Henry Follett is
played by a handsome guy with biceps
Can you imagine that Where your
self-esteem has to be

(throws him the ball)
Man Id just like to move the guy
to the point where he gets to appear
in his own fantasies

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

Silence Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly an unlit
cigarette in her mouth Mumford looks at the clock -- 300 --
and stands up session over Nessa quickly lights her
cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands
up too She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly
to the back door of the office which Mumford has opened for
her and goes out

Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he
walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it

MUMFORDS POV As the door swings open the first figure we
see is Mr Cook he twists around at the sound of the door
He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to
reveal sitting exhausted in a chair his daughter --

SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat
disguised at present by her wan ashen visage She regards
Mumford with some resignation Her father helps her out of
the chair Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford

CLOSE ON Mumford watching her
INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY
LATER Mr Cook is gone Sofie is sitting up on the couch

facing Mumford She looks like she might pass out at any
moment but her voice is stronger than youd expect

MUMFORD
Feel free to lie down Most people
do

SOFIE

Id better not Ill fall right to
sleep I think its too soon for me
to be sleeping with you

A joke Mumford smiles

MUMFORD
What can you tell me about this

SOFIE
Oh lord Its almost too exhausting
to tell you

(tiny smile to herself
about my exhaustion I didnt
really want to come Im not hopeful
right now But I couldnt take the
look on my dads face Hes a truly
kind person which is pretty
extraordinary if you knew the story
Hes the opposite of me I guess --
all stamina and resolve

Its taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a
bit into the couch

MUMFORD
When did you start to feel this way

SOFIE
About six months ago I guess it is
now God it seems like years What
a bore Im embarrassed by it Before
this happened -- when Id hear people
talk about this kind of thing -- I
thought it was a bunch of bullshit

She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- its a
weak but magical sound

MUMFORD
What

SOFIE
You think that now You think its a
bunch of hooey dont you

MUMFORD
(unconvincing)
No

SOFIE
I saw it I saw it in your eyes

Mumford is knocked off balance -- shes right She saw him
clearly
SOFIE
Thats okay Maybe it is My mother
always says -- Everything thats

wrong with you is in your head I
suppose thats true
MUMFORD
Back when this started was there
anything unusual happening in your
life A change of job of living

situation a loss of some kind
SOFIE
No but it started one year to the

day after my divorce became final

Thats not too suspicious is it
But it wasnt like I was feeling bad
about the divorce Just the opposite

MUMFORD
Hmm

SOFIE
Hmm Is that a professional opinion

MUMFORD
Hmm as in -- thats interesting
Sometimes with enough clues its
possible to figure these things out

SOFIE
Even if you dont think its real

MUMFORD
I dont know whats real and what
isnt Thats never been my strong
suit But if youre tired all the
time and youve had to give up the
life you were having and come back
home when you didnt want to thats
worth trying to fix Maybe I can
help you do that

SOFIE
What would you do

MUMFORD
We we would try several things
But I need to see you a lot

SOFIE
I dont know I barely made it today

MUMFORD
Ill come to you Well try a little
walking

Sofie suddenly looks defeated
MUMFORD

Well take it slow Youll never
feel you cant handle it
SOFIE
I dont think I can afford it I
dont want my dad paying

MUMFORD
Well work it out

Sofie gives him a long look

SOFIE
You have the best answer for
everything
(Mumford shrugs)
You seem so hopeful Are you always
this sunny
MUMFORD

No one ever thought so You must
bring it out

SOFIE
Is it contagious Cause everyone
agrees my immune systems way down

MUMFORD
Maybe youll catch it

SOFIE

Can I ask you something

(Mumford of course)
Didnt you tell my dad you didnt
think it was a good idea to come to
the patient

(he admits it)
So what changed

Mumford just smiles He doesnt want to tell her the truth --
everything

EXT BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brocketts large and
beautiful house which sits on an isolated lot on the
outskirts of town

INT HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed
house The weird thing what gets in the way of the decor

is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked
everywhere Many are unopened but the rest are spilling

their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some
hint of their contents a huge variety of catalogue-ordered
housewares clothing linens gadgets and knickknacks If

it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything
can) it is here Althea sounds very nervous cheery
ALTHEA

-- sorry everythings in such an
uproar Lots of big occasions coming
up and of course Christmas is only
eight months away --

(giggles uncontrollably)
-- I dont know whats keeping Jeremy
You know he stays in the city three
nights a week -- I guess I explained
that

(Mumford nods)
1 know Katies here but Im not
so sure about Martin Im making
dinner myself tonight so Ill have
to leave you Im afraid

EXT REAR VERANDA BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

They come out onto the wide porch which commands a
spectacular view of the surrounding countryside Theres an
elaborate bar cart out here which Althea points Mumford
toward

ALTHEA
Im awful I know but will you please
help yourself I just got a new copper
sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and
Im afraid itll be the death of us
all if I dont get back in there

She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door Mumford
gets a drink for himself taking in the view He sees
something out there

MUMFORDS POV Way in the distance coming out of the woods
and down toward the house is a teenage boy

KATIE (0S)
Youre the doctor arent you

Mumford turns to see that Altheas thirteen year old daughter
KATIE has silently appeared Her jeans and little tee-shirt
are meant to be sexy it seems sad on her Mumford nods

MUMFORD
You must be Katie People call me
Doc

KATIE
(motioning urgently)

Cmere Quick cmon

Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the
porch

INT SIDE HALL BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance
Here too the walls are lined with boxes She tiptoes to one
of two facing doors and waits for him

When he has joined her she motions him back a foot for
safety then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in
closet Katies caution becomes understandable the space is
packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons
that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless
move Katie closes the door then pirouettes to the opposing
door which she swings open freely -- REVEALING what was
once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of
cartons in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes

Mumford is taken aback Katie points at packages and speaks
in a hypnotic WHISPER --

EXT REAR VERANDA BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner MARTIN
Altheas sixteen year old son crosses the yard and comes up
onto the porch Hes wearing an old black leather jacket

with a lot of zippers dirty jeans and black Converse All-
Stars that are coming apart In his hand casually but
properly held is a 22 caliber rifle He looks Mumford over

MARTIN
Is this him

KATIE
(nods)
I showed him

MARTIN
(to Mumford)
Do you get it now This is no joke

Mumford takes them both in and nods He understands Suddenly
their manner changes for the worse What they can see that
Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT Altheas husband who has
come to the back screen door with the bustle of a late
arrival

JEREMY
Hey kids Oh hi
Seeing Mumford Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his
hand Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser his
Armani outfit cost 4200 all in His tone hearty and strained

JEREMY
You must be Dr Mumford of Mumford
Jeremy Brockett

MUMFORD
Doc Nice to meet you

JEREMY
Sorry Im late traffic was a
motherfucker Have another drink
Ill be back in five

Jeremy goes inside Martin and Katie exchange a look with
each other then to Mumford Martin goes inside

DISSOLVE TO

EXT REAR VERANDA BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT

LATER Dinner is over Jeremy comes out onto the veranda
carrying two Cuban cigars His casual outfit is as stylish
and pricey as his work outfit He joins Mumford and Althea
who immediately gets up

ALTHEA
Ill be back

She goes inside The men each have a snifter of cognac Jeremy
makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --

JEREMY
I think youll like this Know much
about Cuban cigars

MUMFORD
Nope

Jeremy puts the cigars down pulls a joint out of his cashmere
pullover and fires it up After exhaling a huge cloud of
smoke he offers the joint to Mumford who declines

JEREMY
Makes the whole thing that much
better

Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down He
gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford who begins to
light up --

JEREMY
Just hold the flame a little bit
below the end thats it now
just turn it slowly as you draw

Mumford does as hes told Jeremy lights his own cigar

JEREMY
Are you a man who likes to treat
himself right

MUMFORD
Ive had my moments

JEREMY
I am And Im not ashamed of it
Nobody ever said on their death bed --
I treated myself too well

MUMFORD
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said
I should have spent more time at
the office

JEREMY

Fill in the blank I dont mind the
office The point is you only go
round once Like the Zens say -- Be
here now

MUMFORD
What do you do

JEREMY
Althea hasnt told you

MUMFORD
(no)
Weve been talking about her mostly

JEREMY
Well in 85 four of us left our
firms and formed an investment banking
venture Weve got twenty-three people
working there now

MUMFORD
Youve done well

The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-
satisfied condescending look on his face that no straight
mind would dare His response includes their lavish immediate
surroundings-—

JEREMY
Weve done very well You know
anything about addiction Doc

MUMFORD
A little

JEREMY
Well Im addicted to winning I say
when youre in the red zone you
gotta score
(watches Mumford smoke)
So what do you think

MUMFORD
Tastes good
JEREMY
No I mean about Althea About

her

(makes a face)
behavior Do you think you can
fix her up

MUMFORD
What do you thinks wrong with her

JEREMY
Shes gone weird is whats wrong
with her Out of control Probably
from living out here in Mayberry

Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter then takes a
mouthful of cognac savoring the sensations Mumford watches

fascinated by this guy

JEREMY
Youre the doctor what do you think

MUMFORD
She seems very unhappy

Jeremy gives him a look as if to say duh

JEREMY
I think we all knew that professor
The question the real --
(drawn out stoned)
-- quest-tio-nee is why

Mumford looks at him a long time

EXT ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT

Jeremy Brocketts Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve
INT BROCKETTS MERCEDES - NIGHT

Martin is driving Mumford back to town

MARTIN
But you know how to drive
MUMFORD

MARTIN

MUMFORD
Dont need it

MARTIN
I just got my license two weeks ago

MUMFORD

MARTIN

MUMFORD

MARTIN

MUMFORD

MARTIN
(intense)

They drive in silence for a bit Then --

MARTIN
Nessa Watkins She comes to you

right
Mumford gives him a surprised look then acknowledges it

MARTIN
Whats wrong with her

MUMFORD
Is she a friend of yours

MARTIN
No sort of Man she could be
cool but all she does is get wrecked
and do all the guys Shes blowin
them in the parking lot

Mumford knew that
MARTIN
A persons got to hate themselves to
act like that

Mumford regards Martin with respect then turns to look out
front After a few moments --

MARTIN
Have you ever met a bigger shithead
than my stepfather

EXT THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford
gets out Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his
paws up on the drivers door to greet Martin we HEAR the
clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface Martin rubs
the dogs head

LILY
Ainge
MARTIN
Thats okay Jeremy wont mind Good
dog
LILY
Ainge

The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily
Mumford waves as Martin pulls away

LILY
(to Ainge)
Do we run into the street No I
didnt think so
(looks after Martin)
Nice car Hows that place

MUMFORD
Its a pretty piece of land

They walk up the block with the dog

LILY
And the Brocketts

MUMFORD
Horror show Whatd you do tonight

LILY
It was insane here man Hadda call

(he nods)
Then I did my laundry watched

MUMFORD

(Mumford reacts)
You heard it here first Oh and
being a supermodel its no walk
in the park

MUMFORD
Why do you watch

LILY

No gentleman caller Doc

(they turn back)
Not that I care Ive had it with
men Theyre so fascinated by their
own crap Took me four years to get
the last one out Almost turned me
into a dyke These days my idea of
a hot date is a long shower by myself
before bed Now that feels good And
you dont have to do all that
listening

Mumford laughs

LILY
Oops sorry I guess thats the
story of your life

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN A health information library
website has been called up on Mumfords office computer
Right now its beginning to spew information about CHRONIC
FATIGUE SYNDROME -- Definitions Signs and Symptoms
Diagnostic Measures etc

Mumford is hunched over the computer reading avidly His
printer is churning out hard copies

EXT FRONT PORCH COOK HOUSE - DAY

Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie
He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively

SOFIE
Im not making any promises

MUMFORD
Well turn back anytime you want

SOFIE
(seeing something)
Oh boy this should be interesting

Mumford looks out toward the street A woman in her fifties

is turning into the front walk She stares at them

as the two parties converge She is MRS COOK

SOFIE
Hello Mother I want you to meet
Dr Mumford

MRS COOK
Mumford like the town

MUMFORD
(offering his hand)
Yes Its nice to meet you Mrs
Cook

She finally takes his hand but its not friendly

MRS COOK
Whats happening here

SOFIE
Were going for a walk

MRS COOK
Do you think thats a good idea

SOFIE

Dr Mumford does yes Ive put myself

completely in his hands For today
anyway

MRS COOK
What kind of doctor are you

MUMFORD
PhD psychologist

MRS COOK
Oh not a real doctor

MUMFORD
Thats right the fake kind

Mrs Cook is not amused Sofie pulls on Mumford

SOFIE
Wed better go or Im liable to bail
on the whole thing

Mrs Cook steps aside as they move up the walk

EXT SIDEWALK NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY

unsmiling

Mumford and Sofie foreground walk slowly up the block In
the background Mrs Cook watches for awhile before going
inside

SOFIE
Moms such a cutie

MUMFORD
People usually have to get to know
me before they hate me

SOFIE
Shes not in a bad mood Shes like
that all the time
(a beat)
It doesnt bother me anymore Its
my dad and my brother I worry about

MUMFORD
Maybe but youre the one whose
ass is dragging

SOFIE
(laughs)
Is that the technical description of
what Ive got

MUMFORD
Is she against you getting help

SOFIE
We dont discuss it

MUMFORD
Somethings bothering her

SOFIE
Oh weve all disappointed her Me
especially but Dad of course She
thinks my brothers all right but
she didnt expect much Its what
happens when you marry beneath
yourself

Sofie suddenly seems to be fading

MUMFORD
Please forgive me

SOFIE
What

MUMFORD

Negative thinking makes everything
more difficult If youre going to
have enough strength to do this we
have to talk only about positive
things All right
She looks at him unsure if hes serious It seems so corny
But she agrees

MUMFORD
Okay then Are you positive your
mothers a bitch
(she laughs surprised)
Just kidding

SOFIE
Youve got a funny idea of funny

MUMFORD
(seems worried)
Ive offended you

SOFIE
No

MUMFORD
Really What would it take

She laughs again surprised again Hes got her off balance
makes a rim shot sound

SOFIE
Is this the treatment

MUMFORD
Sorry Im done

SOFIE
Cause Ill tell you none of the
others have tried this approach

Theyve come to the corner He gestures to ask -- shall we
cross She considers for quite a while gauging her strength
then still on his arm steps off the curb --

SOFIE
(absurdly unconvincing)
Hey ‘Just do it

THEY CROSS OUT OF FRAME as we HEAR

MUMFORD (0S)
I want you to tell me all your
symptoms

EXT PATH BY RIVER - DAY

ANOTHER DAY Theyre dressed differently Sofie seems more
vigorous

SOFIE
Im embarrassed The list is so long
MUMFORD
Be specific

SOFIE

Well Im tired all the time
obviously I always feel like taking
a nap But when I try to sleep I
have trouble

(Mumford nods)
My muscles ache And my joints I
feel like an old person or like I
did back when I used to work out too
hard What else

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

EXT HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY
ANOTHER DAY Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest
set of calisthenics ever devised Now theyre doing waist
bends and arm waving Even so its taking everything Sofies
got

SOFIE
I dont know if I mentioned the
headaches

MUMFORD

Did you get headaches before this
(Sofie yes)
But you get more now Or more severe

SOFIE
No not really Theyre about the
same My marriage was one long
headache

MUMFORD
So the headaches may not even be a
part of this

She considers that reluctantly agrees

MUMFORD
I can give myself a headache
instantly

SOFIE

Is that like a party trick

MUMFORD
All I have to do is have two
conflicting thoughts at the same
time Like Ill think -- Taking
these walks is going to help Sofie
get better But then Ill also think --
Mumford you just enjoy taking these
walks and youre kidding yourself
about the benefits

Sofies not sure how to take that She looks away

MUMFORD
There Ive given myself a real
whopper

SOFIE

You actually address yourself by
name in your thoughts

(Mumford laughs)
So you really think having two
opposing ideas in your head does
some kind of damage
MUMFORD
Sometimes yeah pulling in two
different directions at once It
makes tiny little tears in our fabric

SOFIE
Well then my life has been some
kind of huge rip

INT BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETTS FANTASY) - DAY

The handsome Newcomer of Folletts fantasy comes down the
steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt towel
thrown over his shoulder He goes into the bathroom off the
second floor hall and begins to wash up Again Folletts
fantasy world is in BLACK and WHITE

FOLLETT (VO)

The town was a rubes heaven but I
found work my first day out down at
Old Man Sutters gas station and
diner I knew his stacked young wife
was going to be a problem but hey
life is full of problems Back at

the boarding house I was washing up
when I heard a load of yellin and --

IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR the Newcomers POV a nubile teenager
17 going on 35 in a tight cheerleaders outfit comes up

the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down

at her mother Her dialogue distant and echoey

LANDLADYS DAUGHTER
get off my case You dont like
any of my friends

FOLLETT (VO)
I got my first look at the
landladys daughter

The LANDLADYS DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer
watching her through the half-open bathroom door She gives
him a petulant white-hot look then turns on her heel and
goes into her room at that end of the hall She bangs her
door behind her but it bounces open again about a foot The
Newcomer still watching in the bathroom mirror now has a
view of the bureau mirror in the Landladys Daughters room
In there seemingly oblivious the girl quickly strips off
the top of her outfit revealing a 50s-era white bra

FOLLETT (VO)
Lucky for me she was plenty upset
but not too careful

Suddenly in mirror reflection of mirror the Landladys
Daughter meets the Newcomers smoldering stare and her lip
begins to curl
FOLLETT (VO)
Or maybe it wasnt an accident at
all --

MUMFORD (VO)
Mr Follett

FOLLETT (V0)
-- cause in that instant I saw the
beginning of a vixens smile and I
knew --

MUMFORD (VO)
Henry

Mysteriously the door to the girls bedroom slams shut
cutting off the Newcomers view He looks with surprise into
his mirror -- it suddenly shatters

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward
Mumford agitated

FOLLETT
What

MUMFORD
Stop now

FOLLETT

Why Im paying for this

MUMFORD
Not for this Not me youre not

FOLLETT
(challenging)
You find it distasteful dont you

MUMFORD
It doesnt matter how I feel about
it Its how you feel about it that
matters

FOLLETT
I enjoy it Does that make me some
kind of pervert Just because a man
has a rich imaginative life --

MUMFORD
You didnt come to me because you
have a rich imagination

FOLLETT
No
MUMFORD
You came because its taking over
Youre in its grip

FOLLETT
I never said that

Mumfords tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel

MUMFORD
Wheres your wife Henry

Follett flinches settles back down onto the couch sulking

MUMFORD
Wheres your wife Henry

FOLLETT
Go to hell

MUMFORD
(softer)
I didnt hear you

Follett mutters something to himself then is silent until --

FOLLETT
We got divorced
(petulant)
I had to get rid of her She couldnt
satisfy me

MUMFORD
(shouts Follett jumps)
What

Follett seems to shrink in size Theyve been here before
and he doesnt like it

FOLLETT
(softly)
I was never satisfied

MUMFORD
(normal again)
Now were back on track

Again Follett says something under his breath

MUMFORD
Whats that

FOLLETT
(long beat)
You are so mean
EXT HIKING TRAIL - MAGIC

Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion He
comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting
for him looking serious

MUMFORD
Hey Skip

SKIP
Doc I know were not supposed to
get together till Wednesday

MUMFORD
Thats all right Whats on your

mind

Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail

SKIP
How many sessions have we had now
Doc
(Mumford tries to
remember)
Six And its been good like we

were two buddies hanging out Just
shootin the shit

MUMFORD
Yep

They walk in silence for a while

SKIP
This is really hard Everything I
want to say is hard

EXT BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford and Skip come out of the trees climb onto the big
rock and settle down The sun is falling over the town of
Mumford

SKIP
-Were like friends almost who
trust each other

He checks Mumfords reaction Mumford nods offers Skip water
who turns it down Mumford takes a swig

SKIP
I want to tell you something Doc
but before I do I need to ask you a
question Because for me to tell
you this thing -- well I havent
told anybody about this Its the
biggest secret Ive got
MUMFORD
Sometimes its best to keep a few
things just for ourselves

SKIP
Youre a shrink Doc Arent I
supposed to be able to tell you
everything

MUMFORD
Its just a thought

Skip even more unsure now looks away at the town below

SKIP
That really relates to the thing I
want to ask you Ive noticed that

sometimes not a lot but sometimes

when were hanging out throwin the

ball or that time we went

bowling sometimes youll like --
(gets it out fast --)

-- tell me things about your other

patients

Mumford lets that hang a few moments then acknowledges it
silently Now Skip is even more nervous

SKIP
Hey maybe thats all right I dont
know all that much about psychology

or therapy or ethics so maybe
theres something I missed or
something

MUMFORD

Youre concerned that maybe I cant
be trusted with a secret

SKIP
I trust you Definitely No question
But yeah Im a little concerned I
mean youre not supposed to tell
anyone about your patients
problems are you

Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment
MUMFORD
That is correct Skip Im going to

have to take a long look at that

The conversation seems to end there Skips not sure where
to go next Finally --

SKIP
Yeah well what I was gonna tell

you --

MUMFORD
-- Skip Knowing what you do about
me --

SKIP
Doc I trust you Youve listened to
me better than anybody maybe ever

(leans in intense)
And this secret Ive got I cant
stand it anymore I dont know if
Im some kind of --

Skip looks around at the darkening woods though clearly
theres no one around

SKIP
-- I dont know if Im a pervert or
what Its taken me this long to get
where I can come out and say it I
cant back away now I cant spend
another day not knowing if Im nuts

Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself

SKIP

All right Im just gonna tell you
as simple and direct as I can

(one last spasm of

doubt)
And you understand that this is a
big secret Just between us

(Mumford does)
Okay You know Ive got this gift
for certain kinds of machines

MUMFORD
You are Panda monarch of modems

SKIP
Thats right And you also know that
even though I make 23 of the modems
in the world I cannot make one
simple connection with any woman who
could truly love me

MUMFORD

Okay lets say that for now
SKIP

Its true believe me So do you

know what Ive been doing all alone
in my workshop for almost two
years Mr Find-the-Need-and-Fill-
It How I spend my every solitary
hour
Mumford shakes his head no

SKIP
Guess
(Mumford demurs)
Go ahead guess

MUMFORD
(if he must)
Jerking off

SKIP

No Although thats a good guess
No what Ive been working on what
the world really needs and no one
has been able to create --

(leans in whispering)
-- a virtually life-like humanoid
gender-specific anatomically
functional sexual surrogate slash
companion

Mumford tries to put that all together Finally --

MUMFORD
Slash what

SKIP
Sexual surrogate slash
companion

MUMFORD
A doll

SKIP
No Doc not a doll I am Panda Im
talking about much much more than a
doll The world has never seen what
Im talking about except maybe in
the movies

Mumford considers that a long time watching as the sun
finally sinks below the horizon He looks back at Skip

MUMFORD
Hows it coming

SKIP
You dont think Im insane

MUMFORD
(no)
And thats your secret
(Skip yes)

You meant -- like a trade secret
SKIP
No Doc a private secret Its
perverted its pitiful What am I --
Dr Frankenstein Arent you repulsed

MUMFORD
Sounds like kind of a good idea

SKIP
(nonplussed)
Really
MUMFORD
Definitely

Its getting dark fast now Mumford reaches into his bag and
takes out the headlamp we saw earlier He fits the straps
carefully over his head

MUMFORD
Skip thats not much of a secret

SKIP
(hurt)
Its not

MUMFORD
Oh its okay Its just not something
to be ashamed of Maybe you dont

want people knowing -- and believe
me its safe with me -- but on the
scale of dirty little secrets Id
give it say a two

Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the
dusk Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip

MUMFORD
You want to know a secret Ill tell
you a secret Since its just between
us and all

Skip hanging on every word now agrees emphatically

MUMFORD
The secret Skip is this -- I am
not now nor have I ever been a
psychologist

At first Skip thinks hes misunderstood Mumford But in the
huge silence that ensues he replays it and knows hes heard
right Mumford looks around adjusts his headlamp and gets
up

MUMFORD
Wed better get going Just follow
my light And Skip watch your step
EXT MUMFORDS PORCH THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT
This porch is directly above Lilys porch Mumford and Skip
sit nursing beers Theres a cooler on the floor Mumfords

legs are propped up on the porch railing

SKIP
Who else knows

MUMFORD
Just you

SKIP
Its time you did some talkin Dr
Mum -- Wait a minute That is your

name isnt it
Mumford takes a drink of beer

SKIP
Damn What is your name

MUMFORD
Doesnt matter You can call me Doc

SKIP
It matters to me

Mumford gestures sorry no can do

SKIP
Ive told you a lot of private stuff

MUMFORD
I can tell you anything else

SKIP
What about everything How did this
happen

Mumford looks at Skip considering He takes a long pull
from his beer then looks at the frosty bottle

MUMFORD

Did you know that every species of
mammal has found some way to drug
inebriate or anestnetize itself
Even if its just banging its head
against a rock Seems to be some
natural urge to get away for a
while

(one more look at

Skip)
Ive had it for as long as I can
remember The first place I wanted
out of was home

AS MUMFORD TALKS we SEE IMAGES FROM HIS PAST all FROM
MUMFORDS POV We do not see him in the scenes Instead
everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD
even if theyre just ignoring him

glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly clearly
drunk Suddenly her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE
FRONT DOOR which is opened roughly by MUMFORDS FATHER a
coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work But
its his scary scowl that impresses His eyes take in his
wife (and her drink) but he says nothing He barely gives
Mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and
disappears into another room

MUMFORD (V0O)
I thought I had the best parents in
Bald Knob West Virginia till I
was seven years old and got a look
at some others They werent bad
folks

AT THE DINNER TABLE Across the table MUMFORDS OLDER SISTER
eats with her head down On the right Mumfords Mother is
picking at her food Mumfords POV shifts to his Father who
is yelling something at his wife

MUMFORD (V0O)

puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into
the back seat In the shadows is a teen-age girl MUMFORDS
DATE As Mumford moves toward her she flames a Bic lighter
and gleefully lights a fat joint her blouse is unbuttoned
and gaping

MUMFORD (V0O)
On the other hand it made some of
my classmates like me better I
dont know what it was in me maybe
some genes from my mom maybe some
discomfort with myself but early on
I was drawn to any substance that
made me numb

EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Graduation Ceremonies MUMFORDS POV moving across a platform
toward the diploma being proffered by the PRINCIPAL PAN TO

West Virginia

MUMFORDS POV moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a
sheet on the bed He reaches out and lifts the edge to REVEAL

feelings go away was fun Fun was
drugs fun was sex fun was
aggressively doing nothing The only
problem I had with degenerate self-
destructive behavior was I couldnt
get enough of it

INT UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - DAY

A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination
on the desk in front of Mumford The problem is -- Mumford
is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination
paper keeps changing shape

MUMFORD (V0O)
All that fun eventually had an impact
on the work I was doing I figured
what the hell it was only college
after all Id straighten up when I
went out in the real world

INT OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into
Mumfords palm over a water fountain They disappear toward
camera as we dip down toward the stream of water
MUMFORD (V0O)

had no career that turned out to be
not much of a problem

MUMFORDS POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the
endless deserted corridor of the huge building We begin
TRACKING DOWN the hall checking out the various doorways A

never had a problem with was alcohol
I never got drunk I didnt like the
feeling But really when youre as
fucked up as I was big deal

Mumford stands up and stretches then sits on the railing
facing Skip

MUMFORD
Eventually doing all these different
jobs I noticed something For some
reason probably because I was too
stoned to talk everywhere I went --

INTEXT SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS

environments are radically different but the activity is
always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his
heart out to camera

found myself working at the Internal
Revenue Service District 14 Central
Administrative Office I started off

SERIES OF SHOTS computer records scrolling rapidly paper
files being pulled documents being routed

MUMFORD (V0O)

lot of appeal to me

A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut

had ever had

INT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY

MUMFORDS POV SHIFTS around the office First hes looking
at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE
OFFICER who remains unruffled --

But I sure didnt want to be a Revenue
Officer where you were face to face
abusing -- and getting abused -- all
day long

His POV PANS with a couple of intense COLLECTION AGENTS who
pass behind the first scene on their way out of the offices

MUMFORD (V0O)
And being a Collection Agent was
definitely not in my genetic make-
up

His POV STOPS letting the Collection Agents go on another
fellow with the disreputable cocksure demeanor of a private
dick who is lolling near the water cooler watching the
altercation with amusement He is GREGORY an IRS
INVESTIGATOR

MUMFORD (V0O)
But there was one job that looked
like it might be fun -- Investigator

EXT SECOND FLOOR PORCH THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT
BACK TO PRESENT Skip is leaning intensely toward Mumford

(Yul Brynner accent)

Whatever problems I was having were
suddenly gone I had no friends and
I didnt talk to my family The only
constant stabilizing force in my

life was drugs

SKIP
An IRS investigator with a drug
problem

MUMFORD

It wasnt the best situation

SKIP
Did you carry a gun

MUMFORD
Didnt need one We didnt even need
a warrant for most of the shit we

did Man the IRS we could go in
your bank account your credit
cards hell we used to go into

doctors files and get all the juicy
details Nobody wants to argue with
the IRS

EXT ALLEY REAR OF DRY CLEANING FACILITY - MAGIC

leaving

EXT FIRESCAPEROOF BUILDING IN CITY - DAY

MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto
the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial
neighborhood

MUMFORD (V0O)
The way the District Managers got
ahead and won their bonuses was by
generating maximum payments That
meant the revenue officers had to
use all their collection tools --
seizures liens levies -- even if a
more reasonable compromise could
have been worked out The best way
to reduce resistance from the
taxpayers was to build a convincing
case -- whether thered actually
been a violation or not

Mumford follows Gregory crawling to the edge of the roof
and looks down on a building one block over It is a small
furniture factory Employees are eating their lunches on the
loading dock

MUMFORD (V0O)

a particular sonuvabitch and he
knew just how to get Gregory crazy

The parties met repeatedly over a
period of months The IRS offered to
settle for a sizable but they said
fair amount Worrell said hed done
nothing wrong and threatened to fight
it all the way to Washington He
seemed pretty strong I was secretly
pulling for him McLure and the
District Manager stepped up the
pressure

MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregorys government car as
it comes speeding into the parking lot There are two flashing
Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance As Gregorys

car hits a speedbump the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN --

MUMFORD (V0O)
What none of us down at the Service
knew was that Edmond Worrell had a
story too Worrells was that hed
been fighting chronic depression for
thirty years Under the heat of the
investigation he fell off his
medication One Tuesday morning he
went down to the factory early wrote
his family a letter then used the

Mumford nods

MUMFORD
Harder than I thought Took me three
tries But I was highly motivated --
figured there was no point in leaving
me and taking that along After two
bomb-outs I found a place in the
desert

about broke

EXT SECOND FLOOR PORCH THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT
Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door

something new Be back

they just kept you wet all day

MUMFORD
Whod you go with
(Skip alone)

SKIP

Howd you do it

(Mumford is confused)

MUMFORD
You know how easy it is A kid can
manage it if he wants a fake ID
You can do practically the whole
deal at your local Kinkos The only
variable is how much pride you take
in the product
SKIP
I know it starts with a birth
certificate

MUMFORD
All new people start with that

INT ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating
the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already

bears the official-looking designs of Green County State

MUMFORD (V0O)
With desktop publishing you dont
have to deal with printers supply
houses or pesky government agencies
Eventually you do have to get your
hands on a typewriter Ever seen one

this town on a map I thought maybe
it was a sign See

INT ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

The typewriter is just pounding out MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O-
MUMFORD (V0O)
Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rices
kindergarten class with me He was
killed with his parents in a wreck
on their way back from a Steelers
game He was only six years old
which is a real plus so theres a
birth certificate if anyone checks --
but not much else They died in
Pennsylvania so theres no death
certificate in West Virginia thats
also good

ON A KITCHEN TABLE the new birth certificate now filled
out for Michael Mumford is carefully lifted from a shallow
bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby) The paper has
taken on an aged sepia look CUT TO

A STACK OF BOOKS The ones on top are lifted away The bottom
book is opened to reveal the birth certificate It has been
folded in an official way Now Mumford unfolds it then
refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases its
starting to look old

And a birth certificate is enough

doesnt can be easily purchased

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE

Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first
light Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around
his neck At each house he consults the list in his hand
then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper which she throws -- with
varying success -- toward the front doors The activity is
tiring for her but shes committed

SOFIE
SO we get on this incredible steam
engine train that runs up into the

mountains

(she tosses a paper

grunting)
and this trip is everything its
cracked up to be an open car

great views the mountain air blowing
through Were sitting there married
for six years and he says how he
likes it better when I put my hair
back

Mumford hands her another paper which she heaves with all
her limited strength missing the front porch badly Mumford
who cant get enough of watching her doesnt notice at first

SOFIE
That wasnt so good

Mumford snaps out of it He goes up on the lawn and flips
the paper deftly onto the porch As they continue --

MUMFORD
Youre doing great

SOFIE
I dont know if Im going to make it
the whole way

MUMFORD
It doesnt matter Go on

SOFIE
Oh this makes me sound irrational
which is probably right but there
was something about him saying this --
it was maybe the millionth time hed
told me about some preference of

his Well I was so tired of it
(memories)

Seems like my whole life someones

been telling me Im just not

getting it right Can we rest for a

second

She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps
breathing hard

SOFIE

Youre purposely making me talk while
we do this

(Mumford nods)
because you think this is good
for me

(nods again)
and youre a sadistic bastard

MUMFORD
Yes

SOFIE
who thinks theres nothing really
wrong with me

MUMFORD
Oh theres something wrong with
you all right Especially after
hearing that dream of yours about
the Roto-Rooter

She laughs Theyre playing with each other

SOFIE
That was really bad wasnt it

MUMFORD
Disgusting

SOFIE
And Ill bet you can interpret the
whole thing

MUMFORD
Its pretty obvious to a trained
professional

Sofie starts walking again taking another newspaper from
his sack He points to the next house

SOFIE
I hate those dreams where everything
means something

Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch She turns to
him with pride but when she sees the way he looks at her
she glances away uncomfortable

MUMFORD
Is that when you split up

SOFIE
No thatd be a good story but that
was just the beginning of the end
We went on for another year or so

Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house

SOFIE
So whose route is this

MUMFORD
Brady Pecks Fourteen years old
Lives next door

SOFIE
And hes where

MUMFORD
In the capitol for Boys Nation

living doing this How hard could it

SOFIE

MUMFORD
Then you can expect me at 530

SOFIE
And this is legitimate therapy

MUMFORD

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick glossy magazine
pages each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED
SNAP of the page being turned like a gunshot Were SO CLOSE
to the images we cant tell when the magazines change --

from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity
Fair And it doesnt matter Whether the images are ads or
fashion spreads or celebrity candids the look is the same --
jaded hip disinterested apathetic either impossibly buff
or anorexic but always severely beautiful The PAGE TURNING
starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense
Finally --

MUMFORD (V0O)
What is it Nessa

The IMAGES CONTINUE

NESSA (VO)
Isnt she amazing That is such a
wicked look

MUMFORD (V0O)
What do you want me to see

NESSA (VO)
Just chill for a second Look at
this guy it appears hes actually
dead but gorgeous

Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch At their feet
is a mess of magazines Nessa discards one and immediately
starts flipping through a new one beneath it She is very
agitated Mumford stands up walks over and sits in his chair
NESSA
What are you doing Were not done
I just need to find the thing

MUMFORD
If you dont want to have a session
today its okay

NESSA
I want to have the session I thought
it would be cool if I could show you
some of the things that interest me
But I guess youre not into it
which we already knew

MUMFORD
What happened today

NESSA
What are you talking about

MUMFORD
Was it something that happened at
school

NESSA
(petulant)
These appointments were not my idea
remember

MUMFORD
True Should we stop them

A look of panic crosses Nessas face but she instantly hides
it busily taking out cigarette and lighter which she doesnt
use Instead she lies down on the couch balancing the closed
magazine on her chest

NESSA
I dont think you know what youre
talking about

MUMFORD
Uh-huh

NESSA
This shrink school you went to
did you hear about it on an
infomercial

Mumford waits Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin

NESSA
I want to live in the world these
people are in No one ever says
anything in there have you noticed
So theyre very cool Like theyre
all really deep Its when people
start talking that everything goes
to shit

Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears but beats it back

NESSA
Theres this kid at school Martin
Brockett He has some gigantic idea
of himself that no one else shares
You wouldnt believe the crap he
lays on me Who appointed him my
spiritual leader If he has everything
so figured out how come his best
friend is a 22 rifle And whys he
spend all his time chasing after me
Probably thinks Im gonna give hima
hummer

MUMFORD
Do you think thats what he wants

NESSA

(after a beat)
No I dont know what he wants But
I know I dont like being watched
Nobodys ever paid any attention to
what I did and I liked it just fine
Where does he get off telling me I
disrespect myself

(a beat)
Fuck him Look in a mirror bozo

EXT LILYS CAFE MAIN STREET - DAY

Hello Mrs Saito good to see you

then back out there

WHAT HE SEES Skip is once again zipping down the street on
his skateboard in the midst of traffic He has not noticed
Mumford

MUMFORD (0S)
Hey Skip

Skip looks over then immediately changes course toward them
barely checking the surrounding traffic He is extraordinarily
skillful When he gets to the curb he pulls a snazzy board-
flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk
Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight

SKIP
Doc

Skip notices the tour members filing by but is immediately
distracted by the presence of Lily whos a little excited
to meet the local celebrity

MUMFORD
Lily I want you to meet Skip Skip
Lily

LILY

Its a pleasure to meet you

SKIP
(flustered)
Yeah me you too I was at your
house
LILY
Oh
SKIP
Upstairs with Doc Yeah its
very nice I heard your shower

Skip cant believe what he just said Neither can the other

two actually Mumford cant stop himself from laughing but
he cuts it off fast Lily blushes but Skips agitation has

charmed her Somethings happening here

LILY
Ive seen you going by on your board
but I didnt realize -- youre so

young to be so

SKIP
What

MUMFORD
so rich

LILY

(gives him a look)
SO accomplished

SKIP
I may be young but Doc can tell
you Im very immature

Hes making a joke and it represents quite a recovery Theyre
all relieved Then theres an awkward silence Skip watches
the last of the tour enter the restaurant

SKIP
So is this like a Japanese
restaurant

LILY
Id better get in there

SKIP
Thats a lot of people all at once

LILY
Its okay They pre-order Theres a
choice of three entrees

SKIP
What are they

Lily gives him a careful look Is he really interested
Theres something about him

LILY
Meat loaf turkey quesadillas or
salad nicoise

SKIP
Salad nicoise I love salad nicoise

LILY
(giggling)
You do
SKIP
Yeah
LILY

Well come on in
She motions him in and starts to follow Mumford makes a
what about me sound Lily grinning just points to the

sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk

DELBANCO (0S)
Dr Mumford

Mumford turns to find Dr Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler the

shrinks Lionel had conferred with standing nearby
a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco Finally
hands --

MUMFORD
Dr Delbanco Its nice to see you
again

DELBANCO

I dont think you know Dr Sheeler
Shes the other therapist here in

town
MUMFORD
(shaking her hand)
Of course Ive heard great things
about you
SHEELER
Thank you
DELBANCO

You never got back to me
(Mumford doesnt

understand)
I called to say wed like to take
you out for a meal Kind of a

professional welcome
Mumford makes a show of remembering

MUMFORD
Forgive me please What a gracious
thought We must do that

SHEELER
When

MUMFORD
Why dont I call you when Ive got
my calendar in front of me

DELBANCO
What are you doing for lunch

MUMFORD
Right now

It takes
shaking
The other two nod in unison Mumford considers trapped
INT THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY

The towns upscale dining spot Mumford Delbanco and Sheeler
are in a red leather booth Sheeler listens with rapt
admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --

DELBANCO

-annihilation anxieties engendered
by bad experiences with a depriving
mother but no one can escape the
fear of death It is as Henry James
put it the worm at the core Try
as we may to forget or ignore our
mortality James said --

(theatrically)
-- the skull will grin in at the
banquet

Mumford nods appreciatively (He really is an extraordinary
listener) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheelers
adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --

DELBANCO
Ive run on Forgive me Were here
to talk about you

MUMFORD
Are we
SHEELER
(covering)

What Ernest means I think is were
very interested in other
methodology different kinds of
training Were great believers in
learning from each other Ive learned
so much from Ern -- Dr Delbanco

DELBANCO
And I from Phyllis

SHEELER
(back to a previous
thread)
So the University of Kentucky
Who runs the program down there

MUMFORD
My mentor was an amazing teacher
named Benton Mandlebaum Died quite
tragically in the collapse of a
gazebo

DELBANCO
I think Ive heard of him a
disciple of Rothberg wasnt he

Mumfords response and all that follow is calm and pleasant

MUMFORD
Its possible I dont know about
that

SHEELER

I suppose your extended training was
at an institution in that area

MUMFORD
Lots of institutions My graduate
advisor believed we should experience
as many environments as possible --
prisons clinics half-way houses
For a while I was chief therapist in
a shopping mall Had a little spot
next to the yogurt place

DELBANCO
Interesting approach What was his
name

MUMFORD

Dorothy Fowler Fantastic woman She
passed last year in a train wreck
Damned Amtrak

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look Sheeler adopts a
casual tone --

SHEELER
I trained in the east myself --
Cornell -- and I dont care what

anyone says there really are regional
differences I found the state
certification exams out here quite

harrowing Did you
MUMFORD
Oh yeah very tough But I guess
thats good to keep out the quacks
SHEELER

Which examiner did you have I
probably know him

MUMFORD
Wallace Franklin from Greensburg

A dark look comes over Sheelers face for a moment

SHEELER
That was a terrible thing
MUMFORD
(agrees)
I dont even know why hang-gliding
is considered a legitimate sport

DELBANCO
(back on track)
Were interested in any new therapies
How would you characterize your
approach

MUMFORD
My approach

SHEELER
Yes your particular approach

MUMFORD
I dont have one really Most of the
time Im faking it See I think
theres not much that can be done
about most problems theyre too
complicated too deep-rooted by the
time I hear about them The most I
can do usually is look and listen
real closely try to catch some
glimpse of the secret life everybodys
got If I can get a sense of that
well then maybe just maybe I
can help them out a little

Mumford sits back considering the couple across the table
His gaze is so crystalline that after a moment they become
uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other Finally --

DELBANCO
I see

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON Althea Brockett

ALTHEA
-- The argument had nothing to do
with it

MUMFORD (0S)
I understand I just want to know
what the argument was about

ALTHEA
(hates to say)
I had ordered some books The 100
Greatest Books Ever Written

MUMFORD (0S)
Uh-huh What are they
ALTHEA
Oh all the great writers --
Shakespeare Charles Dickens Moby
Dick those people Each is bound
in genuine premium leather with 22
carat gold accents Its a magnificent
set -- and only 3350 per volume
Right away you get Great Expectations
for just 699

MUMFORD (0S)
One hundred books

ALTHEA
Its irrelevant It had nothing to
do with what happened

MUMFORD (0S)
What happened

Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford She has a
bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the
only sign that shes not completely calm

ALTHEA
We argued on Sunday He went to work
on Monday and stayed in the city
during the week like always But on
Thursday when he normally comes
home he didnt Didnt call either
Not till Saturday afternoon

MUMFORD
You must have been concerned

ALTHEA

Its happened before

(a beat)
Im shocked by how little Im feeling
I cant understand it

(a real question --)
Ill probably have a complete
depressoid collapse soon wont I

MUMFORD
Doubtful What did he say

ALTHEA
He said he wasnt coming back He
said it wasnt working for him any
more That it hadnt worked for
him for quite a while You know
what I regret the most Im sorry I
let him make the kids take his name
He was an acquirer

(off Mumfords look
He liked to acquire things
Mumford looks away Althea realizes what hes thinking

ALTHEA
You think that has something to do
with my problem Ordering all those
things

It hadnt occurred to Mumford but its an interesting
thought

ALTHEA

Like I was on some kind of campaign
to out-acquire him

(excited now playing

it out)
If I was just an acquisition to
him and he lost interest once he
had me --

She stops shakes her head

ALTHEA

That cant be it Its too simple
And besides I still like it This
morning I ordered a marble turtle
cheese board from The Horchow
Collection

(an odd look)
Can I tell you something just awful
You know how people who are just
assholes will sometimes look at a
woman whos got problems and say
What she needs is a good shtupping

Mumford nods

ALTHEA
Well there may be something to that
Jeremy didnt keep up his end -- Oh
what difference does it make
(suddenly)

Why do I feel elated Am I in denial
You know what it feels like

She glances at her watch then starts talking fast --

ALTHEA
I know my times up but Ive got to
get this out while Ive got hold of
it --

MUMFORD
Take your time

ALTHEA
(no slowing down)
-- When I was in high school the
thing I wanted most when I was stuck
in class the thing I was always
desperately in pursuit of -- was a
hall pass Thats all I wanted I
loved moving freely around the school
while everybody else was trapped in
there And thats how I feel right
now Like I have some giant all-
day hall pass

She is beaming but suddenly becomes self-conscious She
stands up abruptly flushed

ALTHEA
My god did it just get hot in here
or what

She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her
purse She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up
the front and hugs her body WE SEE for the first time what
all her other outfits have hidden Althea has a terrific
voluptuous figure

ALTHEA
See you next time Ill probably be
a basket case by then

She heads toward the door to the waiting room Mumford
indicates the back door

MUMFORD
You can go out there if you like

ALTHEA
(quoting Mumford)
Theres no shame in getting a little
therapy right Doc

She opens the door to the waiting room startling Henry
Follett who jumps up from a chair out there magazine still
in hand

INT WAITING ROOM MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here But thats
secondary to the impact Altheas current appearance -- sexy
body framed in the doorway -- is having on him Shes been a
customer in his store but hes seeing her now as if for the
first time All his libidinous buttons are being pushed
Althea breezes by oblivious to his reaction

ALTHEA
Hello Mr Follett Have a good
session Bye Doc
She goes out

MUMFORD
Henry

But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has
gone

INT LOBBY ATRIUM PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a
PANDA SECURITY AIDE Her informal uniform and all the other
details in the building carry out the Panda design motif
As they head down the main corridor --

SKIP (0S)
Hey Doc

Mumford looks that way In the distance Skip is descending
from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of
ramps designed for that purpose alone None of the hustling
Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of
the sight

Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp
with a spectacular stop

SKIP
Thanks Jennifer Ill take him from
here

The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside)
leads Mumford into a side corridor

INT BOWELS OF THE BUILDING PANDA MODEM HEADQUARTERS - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS Skip and Mumford move through a maze of
hallways with progressively less foot traffic

SKIP
Ive never brought anyone down here
before

MUMFORD
Im honored

SKIP

Doc theres something about what
you told me the other night I cant
get out of my head Its driving me
batty --

(Mumford nods waits)
Why me How did you know you could
trust me

MUMFORD
Youre completely reliable
Skip is pleased They approach a heavy steel door the
entrance to Skips Workshop A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits
at the end of the intersecting hallway watching this area
Skip shouts down there --

SKIP
Its just me Dino

The old man nods barely awake

MUMFORD
Skip Ive got a problem and I need
some advice

SKIP
You want my advice Far out

Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall Some
lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches
Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door He
hesitates suddenly concerned --

SKIP
I hope nothing youre about to see
will shake your faith in me

Mumford reassures him with a look Skip pushes the door open
far enough for them to enter then pulls it closed behind
them

INT SKIPS WORKSHOP - DAY
Mumford and Skip enter the large windowless workspace What

at first appears chaotic is in fact carefully organized
Many different disciplines interface here

THE BODY SECTION The first thing one notices -- some
incredibly life-like anatomically correct
sculpturemannequins -- both male and female You half expect

them to breathe From there a full wall of forms descends
from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a
huge variety of inflatable sex dolls

THE CYBER SECTION A dizzying array of computers and screens
some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated
motion Above them on a huge corkboard hundreds of computer
generated renderings of skin eyes limbs sexual organs

THE BODY PARTS SECTION Medical models of teeth eyes lips
limbs Hundreds of porn store samples plastic dildos rubber
vaginas sucking machines and sundry genitalia

THE FORM-CASTING SHOP All the machinery you need to make
rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer
designed
All these weird objects are set upon shiny spotless high-
tech work surfaces Skip watches Mumford move about in awe
picking up the odd item

SKIP
Pretty creepy huh Are you totally
disgusted
MUMFORD
(no)

Skip youre a visionary That can
be a burden

SKIP
This doesnt seem a little
perverse

MUMFORD

There are a lot of lonely people in

the world Somebodys gonna figure
this out someday

SKIP
Its not going to be me Im giving
it up

MUMFORD
Really

SKIP

Its all your fault In the last 48
hours Ive completely lost interest

MUMFORD
Whatd I do

Skip looks at Mumford a wide grin on his face

SKIP
Lily
MUMFORD
Lily
(gets it)

Skip thats great You and Lily

SKIP
Oh she doesnt know about it yet
Right now of the two of us Im the
only one in love But Im very stoked

Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section framed by
an array of limbs and sex toys Theres an assembled pelvic
section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him

SKIP
Doc how I can be of help to you
Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a
button The pelvic section begins to hump slowly and
sensually in place Its amazingly life-like but it makes
a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND Skip fumbles to turn it off

SKIP
Sorry

MUMFORD
Wow

Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford

SKIP
Im here for you Doc

MUMFORD
Skip you know that its improper --
completely unethical -- for a licensed

psychologist to carry on a romantic
relationship with one of his patients

SKIP
I guess that makes sense

MUMFORD
Yes yes it does

Mumford sinks into silence He begins to wander the room

SKIP
Youve fallen in love with one of
your patients

Mumford nods Skip is desperate to say something useful
Suddenly he has an alarming thought

SKIP
Doc Its not me is it

MUMFORD
What

Mumford understands and cant stop a laugh
MUMFORD
No Skip its not you But I like
you a lot

Skip is relieved He has another thought and brightens

SKIP
Doc what about this Youre not
really a licensed psychologist

Mumford turns to meet Skips gaze Skip realizes the
ramifications of what hes just said

SKIP
Hmm I guess that doesnt help I
see where youre going here Its a
mess

MUMFORD
Yep

INT DR DELBANCOS OFFICE - DAY

Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler This time Delbanco
is behind his desk Sheeler across the room on the sofa

LIONEL
Dont you find it incredibly
convenient that everyone who could
possibly corroborate his story has
recently died some exotic death

DELBANCO
Theyre neither all recent nor exotic

SHEELER
But theyre certainly dead And yes
personally I find it a bit odd

DELBANCO
It could happen What about his state
certification exams The records
seem to be in order

Lionels derisive snort is so obnoxious its hard to bear

LIONEL
Whats easier than hacking your way
into a state computer and inserting
some numbers For all you know he
never even took the exams

SHEELER
Thats true

DELBANCO
I dont know that its all that
easy

LIONEL

Doctor correct me if Im wrong but
it sounds to me like youve gone for
this guys story hook line and bull-
twaddle

SHEELER
You do seem much more disposed toward
him than I understand Ernest Did I
miss something

DELBANCO
(sharply)
Oh for gods sake Phyllis -- we
have no reason to doubt the man Are
we listening to Lionel now

Sheeler jumps so shocked is she by his outburst and so
humiliated for Lionel to witness it Fighting tears and trying
to maintain her dignity she gathers up her things and walks
to the door Delbanco immediately contrite stands up

DELBANCO
Phyllis Im sorry I didnt mean to
shout

SHEELER

No Dr Delbanco it is I who am
sorry Sorry to have wasted your
time with such

She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office Delbanco
is left facing Lionel who gives him exactly the look the
doctor least wants to see

INT LILYS CAFE - DAY
Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter He watches Lily

busily working the midday rush She sees him grinning at
her but doesnt say anything for a while Finally blushing -

LILY
Stop it Hes a kid Im old enough
to be his older sister

Mumford smiles eats
INT ENTRY HALL COOK HOUSE - NIGHT
Mr Cook opens the front door to Mumford

COOK
Dr Mumford Please come in

Mumford comes in reluctantly

MUMFORD
Hello Mr Cook I was wondering if
Sofie was around

COOK
Were you supposed to have a session

MUMFORD
No Its sort of spur of the moment
INT LIVING ROOM COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford follows Mr Cook into the room Mrs Cook and Sofies
thirtyish brother BEN are in there watching television
Mrs Cook keeps knitting Ben stands to shake Mumfords hand
muting the TV with a remote

COOK
Look whos here Have you met Sofies
moth--

MRS COOK
-- Weve met

COOK

And our son Ben

BEN
(vigorously shakes
hands)
This is a real honor Doctor Have a
seat will ya

Mumford continues to stand
MUMFORD

Well actually I cant really Do
you think I could see Sofie

BEN
I insist Ive been wanting to meet
you
Mumford sits
MRS COOK

(icy)
Sofies not here

Mumfords surprised Mr Cook speaks with some pleasure

COOK
Her friend from the city came and
took her out to dinner First time
in a long time shes been willing

MUMFORD
A friend

BEN
We owe that to you Shes perked up
a lot since you started treating
her

Mrs Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting
MRS COOK
Whatd you want

MUMFORD
Theres something I think we need to
talk about

MRS COOK
What

MR COOK
Elizabeth

MRS COOK

I think we have a right

BEN
We certainly do not

MRS COOK
Keep it zipped Ben

Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look but doesnt argue
MR COOK

Is there something we need to know
Dr Mumford

Mumford is conflicted not sure what to share with them

MUMFORD
Well yes I guess I should tell
you I dont think Im going to be
able to treat Sofie anymore

Mr Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance Mrs Cook
actually cheers up

MRS COOK
Finally some common sense

MUMFORD
What do you mean

MRS COOK
I think you know what I mean

MUMFORD
No I really dont

MRS COOK
I think you do

MUMFORD
Why dont you tell me

MRS COOK
(very calm)
Why dont you go to hell Its alla
bunch of nonsense and you know it

MR COOK
Elizabeth Im tellin you stop
this
MRS COOK
(dismissive)

Youre telling me Thats rich

MUMFORD
(standing up)
Id better go

BEN
Why cant you see Sofie I know the

treatments working

Mumford looks from Ben to Mr Cook who nods his agreement

MUMFORD
Well you see the problem is --
MRS COOK

-- the problem is youre a big fake
You havent got a clue whats wrong
with that girl

Mumford looks at Mrs Cook and cant stifle a laugh

MUMFORD
Wow Youre something

MRS COOK
Take a hike Dr Quack

MR COOK
(ignoring her now)
What is the problem Doctor

Mumford cant take his eyes off Mrs Cook even as he speaks
to Mr Cook

MUMFORD
Problem I guess there is no
problem Uh this friend of Sofies
whered he take her

BEN
Its she -- Roxy Used to work with
her I think they went over to The
Lantern

MUMFORD

(delighted)
Oh Roxy Excellent Roxy

Mrs Cook looks at him sharply Shes heard what the other
two have not

EXT SIDE STREETALLEY - DAY

Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and
into an alley As he passes a secluded space created by two
adjacent buildings something catches his eye

MUMFORDS MOVING POV A young couple is embracing and talking
intimately As they separate we can see that it is Nessa

and Martin Brockett Martin sees Mumford but makes no sign
Nessa twists to see what Martins looking at just as the

view is interrupted by a wall

Mumford walks on mulling what hes seen
EXT BACK DOOR FOLLETTS PHARMACY - DAY

There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to
the back room of the pharmacy but the door inside is open
When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there Mumford raps on
the metal screen

INT HENRY FOLLETTS OFFICE - DAY

Folletts private space is above and at the back of his
drugstore When you sit at his desk and in front of it as
Follett and Mumford are doing now you can see down into the
store through a floor-to-ceiling one-way mirror

The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men unopened

FOLLETT
What is it

MUMFORD
Its a thought I had

FOLLETT
Should I open it now

Mumford seems hesitant but nods Follett takes out an Exacto
knife and makes the first incision but as hes about to go
on Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him

MUMFORD
Let me just say something here I
have no idea if this is going to
help

FOLLETT

What exactly is it supposed to do

MUMFORD
You remember when I asked you about
pornography --

FOLLETT
-- I find it degrading Maximum
gynecology and minimum turn-on --

MUMFORD
-- and you told me that Still
theres some kind of imagery thats
haunting you and I think getting
in your way --

FOLLETT
-- Which I dont necessarily agree

MUMFORD
But you did come to me

Follett reacts Its true even if he keeps forgetting

MUMFORD
My guess is these images were burned
into your brain when you were young
Maybe if we could nail down the exact
fantasies that are haunting you --
maybe you could get past them
Anyway I thought we could try an
experiment

FOLLETT
(indicating the box)
And the experiment is in here

Mumford nods but suddenly looks depressed distracted

MUMFORD
You know what I think this was a
dumb idea

He starts to take hold of the box

MUMFORD
I just heard myself talking and I
realize Im completely unqualified
to be doing this Lets forget the
whole thing

Follett grabs the box back

FOLLETT
Whoa whoa what are you doing I
want to know whats in here

MUMFORD
(pulling on the box)
Theres absolutely no reason to think

this is going to have any impact on
you Im embarrassed to have --

Follett stands up and grabs the box taking sole possession
Loud --

FOLLETT

Hey I agree with you that you dont
know what youre talking about Thats
what Ive been saying all along And
I can guarantee you that looking at
the Lost Ark or whatever you got in
here is not going to mean diddly to
me

(quieting down)
-but if you think Im going to let
you walk out of here without seeing
whats in this box you dont know
much about Henry A Follett

Mumford gives up Follett gestures to ask whether its safe
to put the box on the desk Mumford reassures him Now with
much more anticipation and ceremony than before Follett
carefully cuts open the package

THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the
flaps There is an inner brown paper wrapping upon which
has been set a low-rent catalogue METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES

Periodicals Erotica Adult Nostalgia Follett lifts away
the wrapping --

There are perhaps a dozen mens magazines of the late fifties
and early sixties Nugget Adam The Adam Reader Swank
Dude Plus several cartoon collections Sex to Sexty Stag
Humor Plus trashy adult novels of the era with provocative
illustrations on the covers Night Call Nurse The Neighbors
Have No Curtains Secretarial Sluts etc Finally two video
tapes both of Russ Meyer films MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW
CABIN

We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Folletts hands
shuffle through it rapidly flipping through the pages Very
soft-core by todays standards the common thread is clear
voluptuous heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out
of them) tempting muscular he-man drifters or libidinous
businessmen A world of lusty secretaries siren babysitters
and frustrated neglected wives In other words exactly the
erotic ambience of Folletts fantasies

SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETTS FACE He is transported mesmerized
galvanized In fact at this moment as the MUSIC SWELLS a
tear is rolling down his cheek He dare not take his eyes
from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford The only thing
that could wreck his mood now is --

YOUNG PHARMACIST (0S)
Mr Follett --

Follett jumps startled from his revery As the Young
Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office Follett jams
everything back into the box as best he can and tries to
cover it

FOLLETT
What What the hell is so important
I cant have five minutes --

The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesnt advance into the
room

YOUNG PHARMACIST
Its her sir You told me to get
you when she came to pick up her
prescription

It takes Follett a moment to understand but when he does
his whole manner changes He dismisses the Young Pharmacist
with a nod then gives a quick self-conscious glance to
Mumford

FOLLETT
Uh sorry Im going to have to
(indicates box)
I really appreciate what youre
trying to uh I cant thank you
enough for

MUMFORD
My pleasure

Follett heads for the door pausing briefly at a mirror to
check his appearance pushing at his hair with his palm

FOLLETT
Ill see you on whatever

He hurries out Mumford stands up to leave but first looks
down through the one-way mirror

WHAT HE SEES Follett hurries up behind the prescription
counter where Althea Brockett is waiting once again she
looks quite sexy Follett brings her prescription up and
begins playfully flirting Althea is responsive Follett
motions Althea down the aisle where its more private He
comes out from behind the counter ostensibly to show Althea
something on the prescription bottle Althea leans back
against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in
Folletts first fantasy

Mumford reacts bemused

EXT HIKING TRAIL - DAY
Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail Despite
her labored breathing its clear Sofie has made enormous
progress since we first saw her

SOFIE
When I was in high school we used to
come up here and make out I liked
to sit on the rock and watch the sun
go down

MUMFORD
Thats what I like

SOFIE
Which thing

MUMFORD
Either one

SOFIE
Whyd you come to the house the other
night

MUMFORD

I thought I had something to tell
you But it turned out I didnt

SOFIE
My brother said you were about to
fire me

MUMFORD

Thats one way to put it

SOFIE
I bet I know what changed your mind
(Mumford looks at her)
My mother She was so horrible
you decided you couldnt desert me

MUMFORD
I thought only action movies had
villains like that

Sofie gestures ahead

SOFIE
Thats the cut-off isnt it
(Mumford nods)
I know why you were going to quit
seeing me

Mumford slows at this Sofie heads off the trail into the
woods

EXT BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY
Sofie appears first but she waits for Mumford before she
steps tentatively onto the rock Mumford takes firm hold of
her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle
herself

SOFIE
You feel like a fake an imposter

Mumford looks up sharply

SOFIE
as if maybe you dont know what
youre doing

She puts a hand on his arm

SOFIE
Everybody feels that way sometimes
like were not who were supposed to
be But I have to tell you Dr
Mumford --

He winces at her formality

SOFIE
-- youve been a tremendous help to
me

MUMFORD
Yeah

SOFIE

I cant tell you how much I admire
you You have a wonderful way with
people And youre very insightful

I feel like youve seen me clearly
I never used to admit what a horrible
person my mother was Youve made
that possible for me

MUMFORD
Thats good
SOFIE
Yes And my ex-husband -- he never

accepted me for who I was just like
Mother The things youve said have
helped me understand what a dick he
is

MUMFORD
I dont know if --

SOFIE
Youre shockingly honest thats
what makes you great Ive never had
aman treat me this way With you I
feel really listened to

(gives him a look)
Can I tell you something Its a
little embarrassing but I feel very
unguarded with you

MUMFORD
Of course

SOFIE

Thanks to this therapy I now know
what Im looking for I need to find
a man like you

(laughs)
Not one whos treating me of course

(full of resolve)
And Im going to do it dammit Youve
given me the confidence

Mumford is in agony

MUMFORD
Sofie that makes me very happy

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

Nessas on the couch playing with her usual unlit cigarette
Theres an uncharacteristic lightness to her

NESSA
I mean Doc the dude is seriously
deluded I said that to him I said
If you think Im gonna do all that
shit for you man you are seriously
deluded

MUMFORD
Whatd he say

NESSA
(cant hide her
pleasure)
He said -- Which we already knew

Mumford laughs delighted

MUMFORD
What did he want you to do

NESSA
First off he tells me to stop smoking
cigarettes I told him abso-fuckin-
lutely no As you can see --

She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle
finger flipping the bird
NESSA
Then he says stop smoking dope No
again So then he says he doesnt
want me getting together with any
other guys

Mumford doesnt have to see her face to know how much pleasure
this gives her despite her hard-ass cover

NESSA
-What balls on this guy Whatre
we
(too geeky for her)
going steady Jesus

MUMFORD
No again

NESSA
(long pause)
I said Id consider it Nobody owns
me And the last thing was insane I
dont know whats wrong with him
No magazines

MUMFORD
Really

NESSA
I dont know if I can quit Were
gonna try it together like you
know AA or something And I made
him give up his 22 No more sneaking
around the hills with his fucking
nut gun like some loony tune

MUMFORD
He agreed

NESSA
(yes)
Hes pitiful Doc a goddam puppy I
dont know how much longer I can put
up with it I already got two arms
and legs I dont need another
appendage

She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her
cigarette as she stands up --

NESSA
Oops gotta go

She heads toward the waiting room Mumford gestures to
indicate the back door She waves him off He shakes his
head -- no one wants to use the back anymore
Nessa opens the door to the waiting room Martin Brockett is
sitting there He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the
fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying
around then stands up She goes into his arms like maybe
shes the puppy He beams and looks at Mumford

MARTIN
Hiya Doc

MUMFORD
Martin

MARTIN

(pulling Nessa tighter)
Did you straighten her out

Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side then blows
smoke in his face

MUMFORD
How are you

MARTIN
Insane Didnt ja hear My family
got five hundred times better
(turning Nessa)
Lets go Vanessa

Nessa gives Mumford an embarrassed aint he corny look
but as they go out the door shes never looked happier

GILROY (0S)
Doctor Mumford

Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit GILROY rising
from the chair behind the door Hes got a briefcase and a
document in his hand

MUMFORD
I didnt see you there Can I help
you

GILROY

My names Gilroy Im from the State
Certification Board

He proffers the document in his hand but Mumford doesnt
take it

GILROY
Its all right it wont bite you
Under civil code 129467b you are
entitled to be notified that your
status and certification are being
reviewed This is the notice

MUMFORD
(takes the paper)
Do you want to come in

GILROY
(already leaving)
No thanks Plenty of time for that
when were a little further along

MUMFORD
Mr Gilroy --

Gilroy stops outside door already open

MUMFORD
What brought this on

GILROY
Im not at liberty to say Sometimes
its just routine sometimes theres
been a complaint Well be in touch

He goes out Mumford considers the paper in his hands
thoughts elsewhere

INT MUMFORDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A PACKING CARTON half full of books PULLING BACK

and FLOATING OVER other boxes half-packed with Mumfords
personal belongings -- he doesnt have a lot On the bed an
open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in Were STILL MOVING
across the room and out onto the porch to REVEAL Mumford in
his chair nursing a beer looking up at the starry sky

Mumford HEARS THE SHOWER GO ON downstairs at Lilys Then
the MURMUR AND GIGGLE of a wet couple

SKIP (0S)
Far out

Mumford smiles He gets up and goes inside closing the door
behind him so as not to violate their privacy He goes to
the suitcase takes out some clothes and begins putting them
back in the dresser Right now hes not going anywhere

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco We cant tell where he
is at first As he speaks we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying
on Mumfords couch -- a patient

DELBANCO
and when you said at lunch about
everybody having a secret life
something just snapped inside me I
knew I could no longer continue my
relationship with Dr Sheeler It
was tearing me up inside And I know
Phyllis wasnt getting what she needed
from it What had started as a genuine
respect I think for each others
professional abilities and became
over time a personal attraction had
somehow migrated into a rather
torrid sexual relationship

Across the room Mumford sits chin in hand displaying no
reaction

DELBANCO

I wont go into that today Though
if we should continue these sessions
as I certainly hope we will there
are some aspects of that I would
like to look at God knows Ive
listened to enough people giving me
the juicy --

(catches himself
-At any rate I just wanted to
acknowledge the catalyzing effect
your comment had on me I just hope
that it doesnt come roiling back
upon you like some dreadful undertow

MUMFORD
How do you mean

This next is painful for Delbanco

DELBANCO

Well you see when I broke it off
with Phyllis she was naturally upset
and she became more determined than

ever to pursue certain -- how to put
it -- doubts shes been harboring
MUMFORD

What kind of doubts

DELBANCO
About you your background and
your qualifications Im afraid
Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in
her fury with me and actually took
the whole issue to the state board

Mumford digests this

MUMFORD
I see

DELBANCO
And please for whatever small way I
may have encouraged this accept my
apologies
(brightens)
There is good news though

MUMFORD
Whats that

DELBANCO
Phyllis has decided to leave town
and pursue her practice in the city
Which leaves you the only psychologist
in town

MUMFORD
Dr Sheeler is leaving Mumford Im
sorry to hear that

DELBANCO
As you can imagine my own feelings
about this are mixed Unlike I

must say those of my wife
Mumfords head snaps up He had no idea Delbanco was married

EXT GAS STATION SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETTS FANTASY) -
DAY

We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS
behind Old Man Sutters gas stationdiner in the Folletts
fantasy town In BLACK and WHITE Beyond them Old Man
Sutters stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the
backdoor of the building We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet

FOLLETT (V0)
Old Man Sutters young bride had got
me in hot water all right and now I
was bein dealt the beating of my
life If thered just been two of
those bastards it would have been a
little closer

One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace
CUT TO BLACK then FADE UP ON

INT ATTIC ROOM BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady cleavage
foremost stands away from us having patted the unseen
Newcomers face with a washcloth Beyond her near the half-
open door stands her Cheerleader Daughter worriedly chewing
on her thumb

FOLLETT (VO)
The Landlady was good at quite a few
things but doctoring wasnt one of
them

CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero who this time is actually
played by Henry Follett appearing in his own fantasy for
the first time Hes lying in bed his face bruised in the
manner of a fifties movie

FOLLETT (V0)
Lucky for me one of the other
boarders the broad who lived
downstairs in the front room

BACK AT THE DOOR the Cheerleader hears someone coming and
steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett dressed now
in a nurses uniform so tight the buttons are straining

FOLLETT (V0O)
-Was a nurse

As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door
Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages
and a bowl of steaming water a lascivious look of concern

on her face

FOLLETT (V0)
and she had ways to make you feel
better they didnt teach in nursing
school

Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Folletts eyes
BLACKING OUT THE SCENE

INT MUMFORDS OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch Mumfords
glance takes in the clock and he stands up signalling the
end of the session Follett snaps out of his revery and gets
up

MUMFORD
Im very happy for you Henry

Mumford surprisingly takes Folletts hand and shakes it
vigorously

MUMFORD
I feel like were making real progress
here

FOLLETT

Me too Doc And I cant tell you
what that package meant to me --

Mumford stops him with a dont mention it gesture Follett
accepts and goes out the back door Mumford is pleased someone
still wants to use that door

Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers
when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room Not
expecting anyone he checks the clock then goes to his office
door and opens it

Sofie is standing there very agitated just about to knock
She peers past him to see if hes alone

SOFIE
I need to talk to you Doctor Can
I come in

MUMFORD

Of course

Sofie sits on the couch Mumford sits in his chair facing
her Her voice is as strained as her manner

SOFIE
We havent met in this office since
that first time This is how a real
professional and his client are
supposed to see each other

Mumford waits

SOFIE
It mightve been more appropriate if
we had followed a traditional approach
to the doctor-patient relationship

MUMFORD
Is something wrong Sofie

SOFIE
Yes somethings very wrong Dr
Mumford

MUMFORD
Youre upset

SOFIE
How intuitive That must take years
of training right there Maybe you
can guess what has upset me

Mumford considers a long moment several scenarios racing
through his mind Finally carefully --

MUMFORD
Is it something youve heard about
me

SOFIE

No it is not something Ive heard
about you It is someth--

(stops suddenly)
Why Is there something I should
have heard about you
MUMFORD
Why dont you tell me whats on your
mind

Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes she
looks around frenetically for a moment Then

couch --

SOFIE
May I

indicating the

Mumford gestures of course Sofie swings her legs up and
lies on the couch so they can no longer see each others

face (Its the most vigorous movement shes yet shown us)
This seems to help Sofie a bit

SOFIE
All right Im going to come right
out and say this because thats
what your shrink is for right so
you can tell him whats bothering
you

MUMFORD
Um-huh

SOFIE
(tone still rough)

First of all I have been feeling
much better lately I dont know if
the syndrome is over -- if its just
run its course or something -- but I
feel a hundred per cent better than
when I first came to you

MUMFORD
Im glad

SOFIE
Given that Im obviously not going
to be judging things in the most
realistic way

MUMFORD
I dont follow you

SOFIE
(sharply)
Im saying that since Im doing so
much better -- which I attribute to
you -- Im liable to misinterpret

some of my feelings

MUMFORD
(tentative)
Okay
SOFIE
The point is this -- I am not a blank
page I did not just fall off the
turnip truck Do you know what I
mean

MUMFORD
I think so

SOFIE
I know a little about psychology I
took three different courses in
college Its true none of them
were above the two hundred level
but I took them And there was one
concept I remember very well

MUMFORD
What was that

SOFIE
Transference

MUMFORD
Transference

SOFIE

Yes and that is what I have got
right now I have taken my feelings
of gratitude and relief and
transferred them onto you I have
taken all those warm grateful
emotions and confused them with
feelings for you So that now I am
under the delusion

(a deep breath)
that I am in love with you

Mumford appears frozen in his chair There is a heavy silence
in the room Sofie does not look back there

SOFIE
Hello

MUMFORD
Hello

SOFIE

I think you can understand why I
have some serious questions about
your methods I mean obviously it
becomes much more likely that Im
going to have confusion about this
when your idea of treatment is to go
walking in the woods and up to make-
outs-ville and do all these highly
romantic activities --
Suddenly Sofies voice cracks She is starting to cry but
refuses to acknowledge it

SOFIE
-- We had a paper route together
for godssake Do you understand how
I might be a little resentful Knowing
that this so-called love Im feeling
is totally bogus and just a pathetic
case of transference

Mumford doesnt know what to say Hes on the rack Finally --

MUMFORD
Yes

Silence Then Sofie gets up wiping at tears with the back
of her bare hand Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue
but she ignores it She will not meet his gaze

SOFIE
Maybe you ought to think about how
youre going to fix this And when
you do
(suddenly losing her
will)
please get back to me

Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room but after a
step she stops pirouettes and goes out the back

EXT THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes up the street lost in thought and turns into
the driveway toward his stairs Ainge leaps over the front
yard fence Mumford pets the dog distractedly still moving

MUMFORD
Hey Ainge

Lily rises up suddenly from where shes been working in the
garden

LILY
Doc
MUMFORD
(keeps walking)
Lily
LILY
Doc

Mumford reluctantly stops Lily comes up to the fence

LILY
I dont want you to be mad at Skip

MUMFORD
He told you

LILY
(yes)
Skip and I wouldnt have got together
if it werent for you Thats a big
deal

MUMFORD
(dismisses it)
You would have met in some shower
eventually

LILY
I want to give you something Will
you let me

MUMFORD
Thanks Lily I dont need anything

LILY
Yes you do you damn well do

MUMFORD
(cant fight)
Okay
LILY
Here it is some advice -- do the
hard thing
MUMFORD
Thats it Thats what youre giving
me
LILY
Clean up the mess No matter what it
takes

Mumford leans down to pet Ainge

MUMFORD
What it might take is doing time

LILY
Too bad Thats tough I mean it
Im not unsympathetic But Skip says
youre in love

Mumford straightens looks at Lily and acknowledges it

LILY
Then its worth it
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment then leans over the
fence and kisses her on the forehead Ainge jumps back over
to her side

MUMFORD
Ill tell her tonight

Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs
INT MUMFORDS APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in drops his coat gets a carton of orange
juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it
Distracted he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter
and switches on the TV then opens his freezer and stares
inside

UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on The opening segment previews a
story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from
Gianni Versace then one about a yacht that went down near
Venezuela ROBERT STACK in his characteristic fragmented
delivery intones the preview for the last story accompanied
by appropriate footage

the lonely southwestern desert

run by reclusive monks becomes
the point of departure in a mysterious
vanishing

of a younger Mumford badly photographed in suit and tie
His name is not visible

investigator disappears -- without a
trace

In the kitchen Mumford spins to look DISSOLVE TO

LATER IN THE PROGRAM Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters
etc are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from
Mumfords life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like
Mumford playing him

IN MUMFORDS APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING Clearly
its not the first time Mumford watching the show intently
lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up
When it immediately RINGS AGAIN Mumford takes it off the
hook cuts off the call and buries the headset under a sofa
cushion

ON THE SHOW scenes of tax investigation -- in the shows
version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -
are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking

ROBERT STACK
despite brilliant promise as a
fearless investigator found himself
on a downward spiral of drug abuse
and dissolution

MUMFORDS SISTER the real thing a plain middle-aged West
Virginia woman appears in a dramatic badly-lit interview
(As with all the interviewees she is identified by a supered
title)

MUMFORDS SISTER
we didnt talk much after our
folks died but I know he felt his
life had taken a wrong turn

A snapshot of some IRS-era party happy revelers posing for
a flash Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford smiling and high his
neck encircled by Gregorys arm Candy is on the other side
of Gregory

GREGORY
The guy was obsessed didnt always
know where to draw the line but I

would have trusted him with my wife --
er my life --
(looks off camera
laughing)
-- Whatd I say Both actually
(gets serious again)
Il cant say I was surprised
though when he disappeared

Ragged telephoto shots of the Drug Rehab Center in the desert
low innocuous adobe buildings

ROBERT STACK
Who was this enigma a courageous
public servant or a debauched
addict Either way his last known
stop was here isolated in the

order of devoted monks

cooperative

We dont talk about the people whove
been our guests but I can tell
you this about our order -- we believe
everybody has the right to start
over everybody deserves a second
chance

Shots of wind-swept desert cactus and dust-blown highway

ROBERT STACK
And perhaps that is exactly the
chance the now-sober pilgrim took
on a blustery November day walking
away from the rehab center never
to be heard from again

MUMFORDS SISTER AGAIN

MUMFORDS SISTER
Id like to know if hes alive If
he is I just hope hes happy and
his new life is
(not sure how to put

it)
-well I hope hes found what he
was looking for

Mumford in his apartment watches with real emotion

His sisters face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford
dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform as the MUSIC on
the show comes up A 1-800 telephone number appears across
the bottom of the frame

ROBERT STACK
If you have any information about
this man or know anything about his
whereabouts contact the Sheriffs
Department in Cochise County Arizona
or call this number

EXT SECOND FLOOR PORCH THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of
Mumford

WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees) all across the nightscape
one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV

light

EXT COOK HOUSE - NIGHT
MOVING IN on the porch steps Mumford runs into the shot In
fact hes run the whole way from his place and hes out of

breath He takes the porch steps three at a time rings the

doorbell and waits

Mrs Cook peeks out then opens the front door an especially
sour look on her face She speaks through the screen door

MRS COOK
Well look whos here

MUMFORD
Good evening Mrs Cook

MRS COOK
Just who is here can you tell me

MUMFORD
Could I see Sofie please

MRS COOK
No you can not I wouldnt know who
to say is calling

SOFIE (0S)
Mother

Mrs Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie then
hisses at Mumford --

MRS COOK
I could see right through you from
the start you imposter I know what
youre after I knew it then and I
know it now

Sofie appears behind her mother

SOFIE
Mother
MUMFORD
What do you think Im after Mrs
Cook
MRS COOK
Sofie Its so obvious youre

after my daughter

MUMFORD
Well I gotta say Mrs Cook youre
right about that

Both Sofie and Mrs Cook are set back for a moment Mrs
Cook recovers fastest --
MRS COOK
Itll never happen Youre in big
trouble mister

SOFIE
(scary strong)
Mother go away

Mr Cook suddenly appears takes Mrs Cook by the arm and
makes her vanish Sofie and Mumford are left alone She looks
at him through the screen

MUMFORD
I guess you saw the show

SOFIE
Which show was that

MUMFORD
Sofie

SOFIE
Part of it We were watching ER
until someone called

MUMFORD
You probably got the idea

Sofie comes outside She doesnt get too close or look at
him as she walks to the other end of the porch

SOFIE
Do you know what a betrayal this
is
Mumford knows
SOFIE

How violated I feel

MUMFORD
Youre not the only one

Sofie turns sharply to look at him ready to blow up

SOFIE
You feel violated

MUMFORD
Not me all my other my patients
I smelled tar and feathers on the
way over here

SOFIE
You deserve it

Mumford agrees He watches her closely
SOFIE
I should be irate

Mumford immediately perks up Sofie tries to correct --

SOFIE
I am irate
MUMFORD
(grabbing at the thread)
But
SOFIE
But nothing Im mad as hell This

is a terrible thing youve done

MUMFORD
I know it Please believe me I know
that

Mumford steps closer to her

MUMFORD
But there is one mitigating factor
I want you to consider before you
write me off

SOFIE
What

MUMFORD
Will you think about it

SOFIE
I dont know Depends Im in a bad
mood

MUMFORD

I love you More than Ive ever loved
anyone or anything in my life

She looks into his eyes

SOFIE
Oh

MUMFORD
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you but Im not sure you

feel the same way
She regards him for several moments her mind racing

SOFIE
I sort of do
Mumford feels joy Now finally he takes her in his arms

SOFIE
-but first you have to tell me
something

MUMFORD
Anything just ask

SOFIE

first time a tough guy in his sixties

JUDGE OTTO
Clarence Norman White do you
understand how serious are the crimes
with which you have been charged

MUMFORD
I do

JUDGE OTTO
Do you realize how insidious it is
to invade the most private thoughts
and secret lives of unsuspecting
people

WE SEE theres a pretty big turnout for this hearing
Prominent among the onlookers Lily and Skip sitting
together Nessa and Martin holding hands Dr Delbanco and
MRS DELBANCO Gilroy from the State Certification Board

say you are

MUMFORD
Yes your honor

JUDGE OTTO
It means absolutely nothing to me
that so many of your patients have
come forward with praise for you and
your therapeutic skills You
understand that

MUMFORD
Yes

Follett is sitting in one of the back rows apparently alone
But now he looks down the row Althea is sitting down at the
end in a stylish suit completely appropriate but a size
too small

She gives Follett a sidelong glance then crosses her legs
provocatively Whatever fantasy theyre currently enacting
is working really well for both of them

JUDGE OTTO
Mr White I am frustrated that the
criminal code in this state allows a
maximum sentence of only six months
and a maximum fine of only 2000

MUMFORD
Im sorry your honor

JUDGE OTTO
What

MUMFORD
Im sorry youre frustrated

JUDGE OTTO
Are you disrespecting this court
Mr White

MUMFORD
No sir I was empathizing Sorry

JUDGE OTTO
Maybe you can empathize with this --
Maximum fine Three months in jail
three months house arrest Sentence
to begin immediately at the Orchard

closed This court is adjourned

The judge slams down his gavel stands up and stalks out A
DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford Lionel stands up
