of Aileen Wuornos-

OVER BLACK

AILEEN (V0O)
I always wanted td be in the movies

RAINDROPS ripple the blackness We’re staring at a puddle A
faded wrinkled photograph of a cute blonde 7 year old girl
flutters into the water

AILEEN ‘LEE’ WUORNOS’s adult voice is light and whimsical

AILEEN (V0O) (CONTD)
When I was little I thought for sure that
“one day I was gonna be a big big star

The PHOTOGRAPH comes to life
INT BEDROOM — DAY

Young AILEEN plays dress up in her mother’ s clothing She
preens into camera like a star

AILEEN (VO)
I used to imagine there was a camera
following me around that could see what
nobody else could And I just knew one
day Id be famous

She pretends to smoke and laughs gaily as if chatting with
friends

CUT TO

A child’s hand gripping a dingy BARBIE DOLL It dances across
the top of a cardboard box The Barbie turns as a nutcracker
is lifted to the stage

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
Or at least rich Rich and beautiful like
the glamorous women on the television

INT GARAGE - LATE 60S - DAY

An old fashioned garage empty except for Aileen She lays in
front of the box on an oil stained floor

AILEEN (VO
Id have a good Looking husband and great
big family and a house on the beach

The two dolls are held together in a kiss They turn and walk
off of the box side by side

Getting up Aileen runs her dolls around the floor as if they
were driving then lifts them up into flight

‘ 2

They coast toward the garage door window and part The dolls
aa drift to her side She continues to stare out

CU on Aileen lost in daydream She has a dark BLACK EYE
Lacerations peer out from the collar of her dress She grins
with innocent pleasure

AILEEN (CONTD)

I had a lot of different dreams About
what Id be like How Id live Who Id
be

CUT TO
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is bare Aileen lays in bed She holds her covers
tight

AILEEN (VO)
As I got older I learned to stop sharing

this with people but still whenever I-was
down I would just escape into my mind

She is frightened Her eyes dart nervously then CLENCH SHUT
with DREAD

a AILEEN (V0) (CONTD)
-to my other life where I was someone
else

The bedroom door slowly opens

CUT TO
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET CORNER - 1970 - DAY
TEENAGE AILEEN dirty and unstylishly dressed approaches a
group of teenage girls huddled together waiting for the bus
They glare and erupt into SOUNDLESS peels ot laughter
Aileen’s smile turns to a hardened scowl
AILEEN (VO)

All these people just didnt know yet who
I was gonna be But one day they would

CUT TO
EXT BACKYARD - DAY

f° Teenage Aileen stands behind a garage made-up and
provocatively dressed Teenage boys crowd around

a AILEEN (V-O-)
I started wearing make-up real young and
was always super concerned with my
image

She nonchalantly takes a dollar and lifts her blouse Her
gaze lingers wistfully on a CUTE BOY

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
I was always secretly looking for who it
was gonna be would discover me Was it
this guy

The cute boy stares at her chest then meets her gaze with a
sneer Aileens face contorts instantly into an indifferent
glare

She tucks the dollar in her pocket
cuT TO
EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Teenage Aileen lingers on the edge of an alley A car driven
by a 50 year old man pulls over and Aileen hops in

Ct AILEEN (VO)

Or maybe this one You never knew

But even if they couldnt take me all the
way somehow somebody would believe in me
just enough

The man smiles lasciviously Aileen leans into him Her head
drops out of frame

cuT TO
INT CAR - NIGHT

Her head pops back up Dark now different car different
man Mid twenties and HANDSOME He moves to kiss her veering
away from her mouth and digging into her neck She SWOONS

AILEEN (VO)
They would think I was beautiful Like a
diamond in the rough They would take me
away to that new life That new world
Where everything would be different

PUSH IN ON Aileen’s face her eyes are closed They flip
open anxiously
¢ INT RURAL HOME - NIGHT

18 year old Aileen stands stock still frozen in a shabby
living room The young man and his MOTHER surround her
arguing No words are needed to know the subject is Aileen

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lovers fight behind an idling car He tries barely to
soothe her Aileen is hysterical and violent He loses his
temper and throws her to the ground His car peels away into
the night

Aileen sobs in the dirt Screaming pounding the earth

AILEEN (V0O)

1 lived that way for a long long time
In my head dreaming like that It was
nice

BLACK Her voice returns somber now

AILEEN (CONTD)
But one day it just stopped

The deafening sound of POURING RAIN

cut TO
EYES WORN and RED hold a cold stare
EXT HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - FLORIDA - AFTERNOON

Headlights streak down the highway in the pouring FLORIDA
rain A figure is tucked in the crook of an underpass

AILEEN ‘LEE WUORNOS now 30 years old leans against a
concrete support She is dirty and disheveled The rain howls
through her thin jacket but she doesn’t seem to notice The
contents of her purse are spilled in the muddy water She

stares into her lap trance-like

(NOTE Aileen will be referred to as Lee in the present tense
of the script and Aileen in VOICE OVER only)

Follow her stare down to a dirty 22 handgun She gently
fingers the trigger A rumpled and torn FIVE DOLLAR BILL is
clutched in her other hand

She leans her head back and closes her eyes She draws a deep
5 breath and opens them
fo EXT RAINY HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

A thumb juts into the drizzling rain Lee stands on the
shoulder of the road squinting at the passing cars

AILEEN (V0)
By the time I met Selby Wall shit
all I wanted was a beer

FADE UP the chatter and clinking glasses of a bar
INT THE ZODIAC BAR - DAYTONA BEACH SAME

PUSH IN on SELBY WALL sipping a Jack and Coke through a
straw She is 26 chubby and nondescript but has a soft
attractiveness that betrays her masculine attire Her right
wrist is in a cast

She bobs along to Patsy Clines ‘He called me Baby amid the
DIN OF LAUGHTER and joking

At the other side of the table a BUTCH LESBIAN has a GIRL in

a skirt sitting on her lap The Girl tells an animated story

to the crowded table When the Girl-is not looking the

lesbian winks mischievously to the others and slowly raises
r her Girl’s skirt

Selby GRINS with delight

The Girl scratches her leg but doesn’t notice The lesbian
does it again The Girl catches her and slaps her hand The
Lesbian feigns ignorance Everyone laughs

Selby laughs

The Lesbian tries again and the Girl leaps up in reprimand
She looks around for somewhere else to sit Seeing something
across the room she walks over

Selby’s smile vanishes then awkwardly reappears PULL OUT to
reveal that Selby is sitting ALONE on the other side of the

room

The Girl leans in

GIRL
Hey
SELBY
overly eager)
Hey
GIRL

Someone sitting here

f SELBY
Oe

The Girl swoops up the chair and returns to her table
Selbys face falls She glances around self consciously

The surrounding tables in the meat-market style gay and
lesbian bar are all overflowing Selby nods her head to the
music trying to appear “a part of the action” which only
makes her stick out more

A DOOR CHIME tinkers as someone enters off-screen

The crowd turns to steal a glance in the direction of the
front door Selby follows their gaze but can’t see it She
awkwardly cranes to the side She FREEZES MESMERIZED by

LEE stands at’ the front door shaking off the rain a striking
figure despite the soaked and dirty clothing that shout out
her profession Tall with a shock of wild blond hair her
good looks have hardened into a dangerous shell frightening
and compelling like a wild animal She shoots a scowl at her
observers

Selby almost drops her drink

a Lee pushes through the crowd and slides onto a stool-at the
end of the bar

LEE
(to bartender)
Hey man You got a towel or something

The BARTENDER makes a show of responsibility by rolling his
eyes and speaking loudly

BARTENDER
Ma’am our services are for patrons only

LEE
Yeah I’m gonna buy a fucking beer
alright

Lee pulls out the FIVE DOLLAR BILL and throws it on the bar
He tosses her a dirty bar rag She frowns and pats her hands
on it with disgust

LEE (CONTD)
Wow thanks a lot Gimme a Miller
please

( - She notices a MALE GAY COUPLE staring at her but looks away
with disinterest The beer arrives and the Bartender gingerly
takes the five

)

a LEE (CONTD)
Hey Whats this like a gay place

BARTENDER
Uh yeah

LEE
Hey whatever man

Lee tosses the towel at him and throws back the beer
ACROSS THE ROOM Selby is watching Mirroring Lee she tosses
her beer back for courage She gets up and strides towards
Lee actually to the jukebox behind Lee
SONG PAGES flip by and land on PATSY CLINE

Selby pretends to look at them She darts nervous glances at
Lee punches in some numbers and approaches

SELBY
Hey--
LEE
(to bartender)

Lee points to her mug Selby slides in two stools down Lee
glances over Selby sits at attention Lee looks away The
beer arrives

SELBY
(awkwardly over-friendly)
Hilt Can I buy you that drink

Lee rolls her eyes and stares ahead

LEE
Ive got money

SELBY
(to Bartender)
Oh uh can I have a pitcher Whatever

Lee sighs

SELBY (CONT‘D)
So do you come in here a Lot

Lee snorts a laugh

r

fr LEE

No Hey you don’t have a kleenex or
anything do ya

SELBY
Oh sure

‘Selby looks around hopefully She jumps off her stool and
momentarily returns with some napkins

Lee carefully unfolds them and pats off her face and hair
The gay couple stares smugly entertained

LEE
(to the men - vicious)
Hey you got a fucking problem

Selby jumps with a start The couple looks away Selby is
delighted

LEE (CONTD)
Thanks Do I have mascara runnin

SELBY
No You look beautiful

a Lee snorts uncomfortably surprised but quickly recoils

LEE
Hey I’m not gay alright

Selby tries to hide her disappointment She pours her beer
with a shrug

SELBY
No Well that figures If you were you
probably wouldn’t even be talking to me
None of these girls will So what are
you doing in here

LEE
Truck broke down I‘’ma I got a
pressure cleaning business-

SELBY

upholstery so I’m just getting out of
the rain

SELBY

LEE
Lee

Lee studies the single dollar bill on the bar She shoves it
forward

LEE (CONTD)
Fuck I’m out of here

She gets up Selby watches her desperately

SELBY
Are you sure It’s still raining--

LEE
Lock you fat fucking dyke Don’t waste
yer time Im not gonna fuck you for a
beer

Selby is hurt Lee collects her things As she turns to leave
the insult musters Selby’s courage She grabs Lee’s arm

SELBY
Hey you know what I wasn’t trying to
f fuck you - for your information - I know

you wont fuck me I just wanted to talk’
to you and I thought maybe if I bought
you some beer youd talk to me So get
over yourself

Her confidence fades under the weight of Lee’s intense stare
A long uncomfortable pause

SELBY (CONTD)
I was just trying to have one decent
night out at least talking to someone
before I head right back into my parents
closet anyway So I don’t see how sitting
here with the best looking girl in the
place is a waste of time if I’m the
lesbian

Lee’s eyes bore holes through Selby
SELBY (CONTD)
Sorry I bothered I wasn’t trying to
insult you

Lee pulls out the stool sits back down

SELBY (CONTD)
You you don’t have to stay

( )

a LEE

just trying to be straight with you

Selby nods They both stare awkwardly at the pitcher of beer

SELBY
So are you really a steam cleaner

Selby pours Lee a beer
LEE
No its a real good job actually -

shots at the bar Theyre drunk and happy-

LEE

Lee extends her hand and they shake

LEE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I called you a fat dyke

Selby nods still hanging onto her hand
LEE (CONTD)

Selby blushes She lets her hand go and shrugs Lee looks
around It’s obvious she has nowhere to go

LEE (CONTD)

Lees intense stares returns

SELBY (CONT‘D)
‘a Not like- Youn’t have to do nothin’

LEE
No I know Uh yeah I guess since my
truck you know Sure

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE NIGHT

A cheap plastic globe-shaped splay of FIBER OPTICS softly
illuminates a traditional family room decorated in country
floral The door opens and Selby creeps inside

Lee tip-toes cautiously behind her like a dog who has never
been let inside before She takes in the surroundings with
surprise

Passing through a KITCHEN a LAUNDRY ROOM and through a
GARAGE filled with pool supplies and fishing gear before
entering a make-shift

BEDROOM

The tiny room is filled with boxes that surround a neatly
made full size bed Stuffed animals line the pillows and a
large cross hangs over the bed A small bathroom joins to the
laundry room

SELBY
(off Lees confusion)
Smy aunt’s house

Lee nods in understanding

SELBY (CONTD)
You wanna take a shower or anythin’

Lee is embarrassed but nods

BEDROOM - LATER

Selby sits stiffly on the bed The shower turns off Selby
writhes around adjusting the sheets and frantically trying
to look casual

Lee enters in a pair of oversized pajamas obviously Selby’s
She looks strangely vulnerable She struggles to maintain her
tough facade and climbs into the bed

They exchange awkward ‘goodnights’ and Selby clicks off the
light her eyes are wide with disbelief She steals drunken
glances at Lee Lee laughs uncomfortably

SELBY
Isorry I jes cant believe yer here

LEE
Yeah Me neither

Selby rolls to face her The alcohol has dampened her
inhibitions and she forgets herself for a moment Her eyes
droop open and closed studying Lee’s face with unabashed
wonder Lee breathes slowly and stares at the wall

SELBY
Can I can I touch yer face

LEE
“Yeah I guess

Selbys fingers slowly raise as if approaching a precious
object They skim ever so lightly down Lee’s cheek

SELBY
Yer so yer so pretty

Selby‘s head sinks down Her nose lands inches from Lee‘s
shoulder She breathes it in Her hand slowly grasps at the
pajama fabric

Lees eyes are open and vulnerable Finally they slip shut
Her chest heaves slowly as she absorbs the affection

They lay together perfectly still content

Lees eyes open again now much softer She looks out the
window

AILEEN (V0)
Ive always moved too fast in love but
Id spent most of the day sitting in the
rain about to kill myself so you can
understand I wasn’t feeling particularly
cautious

The NIGHT SKY is bright with stars CICADAS whir in the
distance

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
Hookers had been showing up dead all over
the Florida highways and when I found
myself secretly hoping the guy would just
get me and finally end it all I knew I
had nothing more to lose

A LIGHT BULB clicks on
INT LAUNDRY ROOM

The washing machine lid opens Lees clothing tumbles in

( )
co

AILEEN (VO)
Everybodys got faith in something For
me all I’d had left was love But when
my boyfriend took off and stole all of my
pressure cleaning equipment something
finally broke

She adds some detergent and spins the dials The washer WHIRS
into action —

The FRIDGE DOOR swings open on the fully stocked fridge
KITCHEN
Lee is delighted and starts pulling things out

AILEEN (VO)
I ‘know that part had sounded like a lie
but Id spent two years saving up for
that stuff so when he left I was pretty
sure I’d never love a man again

A beer CRACKS open Tupperware PEELS apart Boxes are OPENED

Lee sits at the kitchen table in front of a feast of
leftovers She voraciously stabs at everything

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
And without love without even hope of
it what’s the point Even a bum on the
streets is looking for something
alcohol drugs something

The lights on a STEREO SYSTEM flip on
LIVINGROOM

Lee turns up the volume CLASSICAL MUSIC fades up She kicks
off her shoes tumbles into the couch and picks up a
magazine

AILEEN (VO0) (CONTD)
The only reason I didnt do it was a five
dollar bill I kept feeling it in my
pocket and it was bugging me

Suddenly uncomfortable Lee digs in her pajama pocket She

pulls out a crumpled five dollar bill and tosses it onto the
coffee table

a

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
I knew Id probably given some asshole a
blow job for it so it really started to
piss me off that if I killed myself
without spending it then I would have
basically sucked him off for free

A FAINT CRY is heard Lee grabs the remote turns down the
radio and listens

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
(worried)
Honey

Her face tenses with concern After a beat she gets up and
slowly heads up the stairs

AILEEN (VO)
So I made a deal I said “God youve
done this to me and I don’t know why
Now I’m going into town to spend this
five bucks but when it’s gone so am
I
Reaching an upstairs corridor she swings a left
AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
So if youve got something for me in
this world you had better bring it on”

Light spills from beneath a closed door Her hand grips the
doorknob and turns it

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
And sure enough there she was

Reverse to SELBY dressed like a HOUSEWIFE propped up with
pillows in a king sized bed She lowers a book

SELBY

Lee beams with absolute love

Lee jumps up into an aggressive position as the door opens
and AUNT DEBBIE leans in Her face contorts in shock She
SLAMS the door shut Selby scrambles up

Selby leans out the door but she’s gone

Lee is out of the bed and dressing They exchange worried
guilty smiles

He rolls his eyes and moves to the couch Debbie glances up
sternly as Selby rounds the corner from the garage with Lee

Selby nods obsequiously and they turn back

Lee winks sheepishly squeezes her hand and walks away
INT KITCHEN - LATER

Debbie folds the ironing board Trevor sits dressed and
sullen at the table Selby walks in picks at a plate of
pancakes She studies Debbie who avoids eye contact with her

RANDY a big man with an angry demeanor stomps through the
kitchen with his keys

RANDY
Let’s go

DEBBIE
Just one sec

Randy swings back around furiously

RANDY
Well don’t hurry me to get ready if

Debbie quickly stashes the ironing board snatches the plates
off the table and drops them in the sink

EXT SURE-SAFE STORAGE - DAY

Lee SNEAKS between rows of storage units beside a large
dilapidated house Inside the blinds whips open Lee ducks
around the corner

RITA an overweight woman with a permanent scowl storms up
to find Lee disappearing under a metal grate

Lee stifles shame with an indifferent sneer She pulls out
clothing a comb and some make-up and sets it aside

THOMAS late 40’s in fatigues and a POW MIA t-shirt comes
around the corner His leg is extremely crippled and he drags

INT GAS STATION BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Water splashes into a filthy sink Lee is in her underwear
and washes down with hand towels

A HAND DRIER roars on
She flips her head upside and hangs it underneath
Lee scrutinizes the mirror Carefully feathering her hair
INT MOONLIGHT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT

The GLITTERING COLORFUL LIGHTS of a MIRRORBALL shine down on
the lower class masses (Note Throughout POP MUSIC circa

Selby sits in the CONCESSION AREA anxiously scanning the
room Through the crowd she spots Lee at the entrance

Selby jumps up checks her appearance and calms herself

ANGLE ON Lee seeing Selby and doing the same Selby walks
up already reaching in her pocket They try to act

nonchalant
SELBY

Selby turns beet red and takes her arm Lees hand reaches
around her back She skates backwards fluidly glancing
behind her

Trevor spots them from the railing He shoots a smirk at

They look in each ‘others eyes Selby flushed with fear and
excitement Lee’s hands tighten around her back Selby’s eyes
are vulnerable searching Lee for proof that this could

her teeth with hatred as soon as she turns

A tear wells in Lee’s eye She wipes it away and instantly
shakes it off with a grin Selby is stunned Her mind churns
fighting against persuasion but struggling

LEE (CONTD)

stuff For you to know but look

cash on the table Selby’s jaw drops

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)

I had a plan and a knife I knew he was
coming to dinner so I went to his house
and hid outside in the bushes I was so
ready and so filled with hate but when
he finally stepped out he looked so big
and I felt so small and ridiculous that I
lost my nerve

She unlocks the car tosses her bag in and opens his wallet

AILEEN (VO) (CONTD)
I couldn’t do it Just watched him walk
away Went home and ate dinner with him
Mom yelled at me for being rude when he
asked me for the salt

She pulls out a 10 and some single with a frown Flips on

A portrait style PHOTOGRAPH of Evan and his WIFE She’s in a
WHEEL CHAIR They smile happily His eyes loving and warm

Lees jaw sets she doesn’t want to see this
AILEEN (V0) (CONTD)
Years later when I found out he had died
in a car accident I was overjoyed It
was like God finally struck him down for
all his evil I loved it

She flips through the plastic sleeves Page after page of
photos and souvenirs replace credit cards
