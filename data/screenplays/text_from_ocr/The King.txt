EXT FIELD NORTH ENGLAND - AFTERNOON

TITLE CARD the early 15th century

A scorched battlefield littered with the dead and dying
Hundreds of tangled bodies strewn across the field Horses among
them So thick and twisted they carpet the sodden earth A

deformed mass Bloody black and brown

A WARRIOR walks the field Broad shouldered A cape of fur over
leather and chain mail He walks laboured

A body squirms at his feet He stops He raises his worn sword
and as if planting a flag he thrusts the metal down into the
dying man’s back The body arches stiff and then goes limp

He continues on in this fashion casually roaming the destroyed
bodies and giving those still moving their silence Around him
across the field others pore over the bodies pilfering
valuables or taking the not-fatally wounded hostage

The warrior turns His scarred face young but lined Sad
soulful eyes Despite being a clear victor here he looks
displeased agitated dark

This is SIR HENRY ‘HOTSPUR’ PERCY He continues his macabre
walk

He stops at the body of a man wheezing his last shallow breaths
into the dirt With his filthy bloody boot Hotspur heaves the
man onto his back and regards him with what looks for a moment
like pity He then plunges his sword into the man’s chest

Walk Stab Walk Stab

He watches an injured man stand shakily and walk - fall - get to
his feet again and walk The man trips and keeps moving

Hotspur walks beside him for a few steps Falling into step he

watches the limping man’s action studies him curiously Blood

from a deep gash across his face makes it impossible for him to
see from either eye Other injuries too

HOTSPUR
Where go you my friend

The man turns to the sound Scared he tries to continue

HOTSPUR (CONTD)
You’re hobbling in the wrong
direction That wind you feel is
blowing from England Scotland is
that way
The limping man uncertain turns and follows the wind

Hotspur turns and walks away Stab

INT ANTECHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Royal Court London Hotspur cleaned from the battlefield
walks the hall with his father the EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND beside him Northumberland appears wary Hotspur strides

They are met by sentries and the Chief Justice SIR WILLIAM
GASCOIGNE

WILLIAM
My Lords Percy

HOTSPUR
We have come to see the King

WILLIAM
Im afraid His Majesty is engaged
with other concerns Is he
expecting your visit

HOTSPUR
I should hope he is We are but the
men who have spilled blood in his
name I should hope that he expects
our visit with enthusiasm

William notes Hotspur’s hostility and disappears through the
antechamber to a room beyond

Hotspur’s agitation is a source of unease for Northumberland -
an unease which cannot be addressed openly before the silent
helmeted sentries standing watch

NORTHUMBERLAND
My son Be calm

Hotspur stares boiling in the direction of the door beyond
which the King is engaged with his other matters

INT PARLOUR ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hotspur and Northumberland sit at one end of a long dining
table They are quiet Hotspur’s agitation boils

A door opens KING HENRY IV hobbles in Royal courtiers follow
William the EARL OF WESTMORLAND LORD SCROPE OF MASHAM the
EARL OF CAMBRIDGE SIR THOMAS GREY the EARL OF DORSET among
them
HENRY IV
My lords I am most sorry for
making you wait I know you have
travelled far and from great
travail

The King extends his signet for the lords to kiss
Northumberland does so obligingly eyes lowered Hotspur
kisses the ring while looking Henry coldly in the eye

HENRY IV (CONTD)
I pray you will know this time of
civil unrest consumes me day and
night

As the King and his courtiers take their seats servants bring
food to the table Others present jugs and bowls of water for
the men to rinse their hands

HENRY IV (CONTD)
I understand battle with the rebel
Scots was hard fought Is this
true

Hotspur stares Northumberland fills the awkward space

NORTHUMBERLAND
It was my liege We lost some
three hundred men

They bow their heads as the King says a Latin blessing

HENRY IV
Benedic nos Démine et haec Tia déna
quae de Tia largitate stmus
sumpttri Per Christum Déminum
néstrum Amen

ALL
Amen

The men eat the King as heartily as his frailty will allow
Hotspur doesn’t eat Henry looks to him

HENRY IV
And how many prisoners were taken

NORTHUMBERLAND
Some two hundred my liege

HENRY IV
Good Hotspur you led the charge
Were any prisoners of note taken
HOTSPUR
Many

HENRY IV
Are they in train

HOTSPUR
No

Henry eats ignoring the insolence

HENRY IV

And why is that Why have they not
been brought directly to me as is
their designation

HOTSPUR
Why will you not pay cousin
Mortimer’s ransom

HENRY IV
Youll need to speak up my boy
I’m an old man My ears are filled
with hair

HOTSPUR
Cousin Mortimer is held by the
rebels of Wales Why do you refuse
to pay his ransom

HENRY IV
I refuse to pay Mortimer’s ransom
because I refuse to believe
Mortimer a prisoner I rather
believe Mortimer to be a traitor

Henry lets this sit He eats Hotspur boils Moments pass

HENRY IV (CONTD)
Your victory over the Scots was a
most heroic one heroic because
improbable Our most recent loss to
the Welsh however should not have
been suffered Our strength should
have had it staved And I must
conclude only that it was suffered
with Mortimer’s help that Mortimer
has joined the Welsh rebels that
he has betrayed England and that
far from being a prisoner your
cousin is now an enemy of mine and
therefore of yours

Henry examines his chicken wing Hotspur stares The other men
try not to be noticed

HENRY IV (CONTD)
Do you agree with my précis good

Hotspur
HOTSPUR
No
NORTHUMBERLAND
My son
HOTSPUR
I believe yours to be the ramblings
of a crazy old demon
NORTHUMBERLAND

Harry Please Stop this

HENRY IV

Let him speak I wish to hear him
NORTHUMBERLAND

My liege -
HOTSPUR

Yours are the ramblings of an old
man so saturated with malice and
mistrust that he no longer knows up
from down who can no longer see
beyond the walls of his own
monstrous schloss

Henry stops eating He pays Hotspur his full attention almost
inviting Hotspur to continue Hotspur emboldened does so

HOTSPUR (CONTD)
My family has served you My
father my uncle We aided you in
your ascension And still we fight
for you Cousin Mortimer has fought
for you - hard and for many years
And yet while you now slobber over
that chicken’s wing he shivers in
a western prison awaiting
mutilation at the hands of Welsh
witches

NORTHUMBERLAND
My liege you must forgive my son
He needs rest We come only to
advocate for your help in securing
Mortimer’s release
HOTSPUR
All that we have done for you we
have done for the good of England
but I fear now that we have made a
terrible mistake I fear the
battles we have fought have been
fought only to indulge your hateful
madness Our lands are now more
riven with war than ever before
You have rebellion stewing in all
corners The Scots are not
finished The Welsh have only just
begun And for what Why do you
think this might be old man Who
do you imagine might be to blame
for this

All are stunned silent Henry watches Hotspur strangely and
impassively for a protracted moment

NORTHUMBERLAND
My liege

HENRY IV
They say chickens can’t fly but
I’ve seen one eke enough wing flap
to clear a fence And then it’s
free But then so too are the
foxes

Henry continues his dull stare at Hotspur Hotspur boils but
Henry’s gleeful crypticism is intimidating

HENRY IV (CONTD)

You are right young Percy I owe
you much I owe your family still
more You have fought nobly for me
You carry wounds fresh for me to
see And your grievances too - they
have been heard But if the
Scottish traitors you have taken
prisoner are not brought to me as
speedily as they might travel I
will hang you by your fucking neck

Henry watches him another moment

HENRY IV (CONTD)
Has this been heard Percy

Hotspur fumes He heaves his chair from the table and strides to
the door Northumberland rises meekly and bows

Scrope looks to him catching his eye
NORTHUMBERLAND
Please forgive us Your Majesty

They scurry after Hotspur Henry watches them leave The
courtiers remain silent unable to read the King’s disposition

HENRY IV
What a venomous boy He’1ll betray
me now I’m sure of it
Henry returns his attention to his chicken wing
HENRY IV (CONTD)
But if only he were my son

INT APARTMENT EASTCHEAP - DAY

PRINCE ‘HAL’ HENRY lies face down and naked on a bed in
a spartan single-room apartment He’s sprawled and snoring

Daylight punches through the window Sounds of people and
animals from the street below

The sound of keys in the door It opens An unkempt SIR JOHN
FALSTAFF and BEALE enter Falstaff’s arm bleeds badly

Falstaff shuts the door behind him loudly Hal wakes with a
start

HAL
What is this

BEALE
Falstaff has injured his self

HAL
How did you get in

FALSTAFF
The door was ajar
HAL
It wasn’t
FALSTAFF

It was It was ajar

HAL
It was not ajar

FALSTAFF
How else might I gain entry Are
you accusing me of having cut
myself a secret key

HAL
Yes

BEALE
Falstaff has injured his self Hal

HAL
Why have you come here What happened
to you

Hal’s head is throbbing Beale rifles through Hal’s stuff

FALSTAFF
I think it best a man of your
standing not be burdened with those
particulars I think it best the
circumstances in which the injury
was accrued be left entirely
mysterious

Beale has found a bottle of liquor

BEALE
(to Hal)
Will you perform the small repairs
HAL
No
FALSTAFF

Your Highness This task requires
expertise Should you not assist I
fear our friendship may come to a
foul end right here on your floor

INT APARTMENT EASTCHEAP - MOMENTS LATER

Hal stirs honey in a pot Beale pours wine over the gash in
Falstaff’s arm

FALSTAFF
There’s a fresh coin in this for
you

HAL

I don’t want your coin I will
require your undiminished loyalty
and devotion from here til Megiddo
FALSTAFF
You have that already You’re a
soft negotiator

Hal puts the honey pot down and goes to the fireplace He pulls
an iron rod from the fire Beale trickles more booze

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
You’re wasting good wine

BEALE
I’m keeping it clean

Hal sits beside Falstaff He wipes the wound with a strip of
linen He then presses the red hot poker right onto it Falstaff
screams a scream that quickly turns to maniacal laughter

EXT STREET EASTCHEAP - DAY

Hal Falstaff and Beale walk the street in a mangy part of
London Butchers’ stalls garbage and mud Fires and smoke
Dogs pigs and filthy kids

Two men in clean cloaks step out of a dark doorway and follow

Another two men appear from an alley and step in front of Hal
their mouths and noses covered by handkerchiefs

CLOAKED MAN
Prince Henry

Falstaff and Beale are immediately on edge They reach
discreetly inside their coats for concealed weapons

HAL
Who are you

CLOAKED MAN
We come from the royal court We
wish to speak with you privately

HAL
For what

CLOAKED MAN
Please sire Privately

FALSTAFF
Privately in the middle of
Eastcheap Shall I make a quick up
and down to request a mass covering
of ears

CLOAKED MAN
(ignoring Falstaff)
Please sire

Hal registers the look of earnest intent on the cloaked man’s
face He leads him away into a darkened alcove

HAL
What is this

CLOAKED MAN
Your father His Majesty King -

Hal pulls the kerchief from the man’s face forcing him to
breathe the fetid air

CLOAKED MAN (CONTD)
Your father His Majesty King
Henry is ill He requests your
presence

Hal pauses momentarily processing this mention of his father

HAL
For what

CLOAKED MAN
Your presence has been requested

HAL
I suggest you return to the palace
directly and tell him his request
was wholly ignored

CLOAKED MAN
I have been instructed to deliver
the request with great urgency

HAL
Then you might tell him your
urgency was also wholly ignored

Hal steps past the man leading Falstaff and Beale away

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - DAY

A dingy tavern Falstaff sits with others among them Beale and
a drunk Hal

FALSTAFF
Remember Remember that as we speak
there are two Popes Two One in
Rome One in France

(MORE )

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
They both claim to be the Lord’s
voice here on earth They can not
both be Why would a good Lord
allow his kingdom to be so puzzled
He wouldn’t is that question’s
answer

DRINKER
Which then is the true Pope

FALSTAFF
I say not one or the other I say
the very fact of their quarrel
makes them both snakes And so if
our holy Roman fathers can not
convey to us a true voice of
authority why should we assume
that those snakes beneath them
speak with any authority The whole
house is writhing with snakes -

DRINKER
Stop this now

FALSTAFF
Why now

DRINKER

I says stop

FALSTAFF
Are you afraid Thomas might come
for you in the night Don’t be
afraid of my ideas They’re only
ideas

DRINKER
You sit before me now and tell me
you no believe in the power of the
one true God

FALSTAFF
I do not I do believe in the one
true God How dare you suggest
otherwise I do not believe that
our Archbishop of Canterbury speaks
for him I would say our Archbishop
Thomas Arundel only claims to speak
for him

DRINKER
To what end

FALSTAFF
Clearly to his own damned end

DRINKER
You best bite your tongue in the
company you keep You’1ll have
yourself necked

FALSTAFF
(to Hal)
You would have me necked

Hal smiles

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
(to the drinker)

I would say your devotion to the
Archbishop - if it is devotion and
not a slickly ruse to warm the mood
of this company I keep - I would
say it has me a more true believer
in the one God than you

DRINKER
Bite your tongue or I will neck you
myself

FALSTAFF

Bite my tongue Why on this earth
would I bite my own tongue

DRINKER
Your word in this air is a poison

FALSTAFF
Oh My voice riles you Maybe then
better you should bite your own
ears off
(starts laughing at the

thought of it)
Bite your own ears off And maybe
after you should kick yourself in
your own balls

The drinker stands as if to confront Falstaff Hal laughs
From across the room the tavern’s hostess HOOPER yells -

HOOPER
Stop now

Falstaff meanwhile is attempting to bite his own ears off
And then as the drinker takes a step closer Falstaff springs
up and pins him against a wall a dagger to his throat

FALSTAFF
Now now Settle my petal You have
a little brutish feeling in your
belly I see there be only one
course to straighten this
dispute
(beat cold stare)

You and I will cockfight
(releases the drinker his
tone lightens instantly)

Hal my knee is queer You must be
my cock

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - MOMENTS LATER

A space has been cleared on the floor to stage the cockfight
The ‘cocks’ are Hal and the drinker crouched on haunches and
facing off Beale stands behind Hal holding a horizontal
sword six inches over his head Another man stands behind the
drinker holding a stick six inches over his

FALSTAFF

Rules are plain You topple over

you lose You rise your head to the

level you lose Those are the

rules Un deux trois
The fight is on Hal and the drinker waddle towards each
other swiping and grabbing They tussle retreat Tussle
retreat Onlookers yelp support And then Hal grabs the
drinker by his knee and topples him over Onlookers howl
Falstaff raises his arms in the air

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
The Lord hath spoken

Hal lies on his back laughing

INT APARTMENT EASTCHEAP - NIGHT 8
Hal is drunk He kisses a young woman on the bed They laugh

WOMAN
Your Highness

Hal stops laughing

WOMAN (CONTD)
Your Highness

Hal covers her mouth He is suddenly dark and distant

HAL
Stop

She is taken by surprise intimidated

HAL (CONT’D)
Stop

Hal takes his hand away She seems uneasy He kisses her The
woman has gone quiet

INT APARTMENT EASTCHEAP - MORNING

Hal snoring The woman sleeps beside him Then the sound of a
key in the door -

Falstaff enters He opens the curtain stirring the woman With
unforced chivalry he coaxes her from bed Hal doesn’t stir

FALSTAFF
My lady It’s time to leave

He gathers her clothes She wakes groggily
FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
That’s good my dear Jump up The
day has begun

WOMAN
Why
FALSTAFF
Shhh The day has begun Look Out
there It’s well underway You might
miss it
Disoriented the woman lifts herself Falstaff holds her shirt

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
That’s the spirit Lift your arms

She lifts her arms Falstaff pulls the shirt down over her head

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
I’m sorry to interrupt your slumber

He ushers her out of the room and closes the door behind her He
places a cup of ale beside Hal and sits

HAL
What are you doing

Hal speaks muffled groggy face smudged into the pillow

FALSTAFF
Can you hear me
Hal grunts

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
You must get that door fixed

HAL
What is it

FALSTAFF
Visit with your father
HAL
Go away
FALSTAFF

If your father is indeed enough
gravely ill to request your
presence then you must visit with
him - it should be better to regret
having done so than it would to
have not No matter your feelings
for him If your father is ill you
must visit with him And - let me
add - I say it not out of concern
for our king’s well being more for
fear of the drunken soak to which
you be likely to succumb should you
fail to heed his call and he were
to die without you having squared

your ledger I fear it would be
soak enough to put even me to
shame

Hal stares at Falstaff lucid and penetrating with his one eye
not smudged into the pillow Falstaff watches Hal a moment

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
Do it If nothing else I ever
suggest

Falstaff rises and exits Hal percolates Falstaff’s advice

EXT ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal at the palace gates Without exchange with the guards he is
granted entry All watch him with cold interest if not disdain

INT ANTECHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal walks the hall under escort As he approaches the
antechamber he crosses paths with Grey and Cambridge on their
way into the great hall Grey eyes him with contempt
Cambridge looks at him cautiously searching

William approaches Hal with something more like compassion He
genuflects subtly

WILLIAM
My lord Your father expects you

HAL
He shouldn’t

William observes Hal’s state of dishevelment

INT GREAT HALL ROYAL COURT - DAY

King Henry is in his chair visibly weak presiding over a
sitting of parliament The full court plus THE ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY and clerical attendants are there

THOMAS OF LANCASTER the King’s 18 year-old son Hal’s younger
brother is there too

The Archbishop is addressing the king He’s bumptious but
nervous and has a lisp

ARCHBISHOP
Never Never would I dare doubt
Your Majesty’s piety however I
would remind you of the service we -

HENRY IV
Archbishop I would have thought
our lord above would want us all to
share in his bounty

ARCHBISHOP
My liege while I see the strain
your treasury is under I can not
help but wonder if the canker of
Lollardy be somehow at the root of
this suggestion that I - or rather
the church - be burdened with a tax
to relieve problems that are not of
the church’s making

WILLIAM
Your Highness

Hal

King looks up Others turn also as Hal steps into the room

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Henry Prince of Wales

HENRY IV
My son Come to me

Archbishop appears put out He regards Hal with derision

crosses the room He bows before his father taking in
frailty Henry takes in his son’s slovenliness

HENRY IV (CONTD)
Come closer

takes a step closer Henry watches him a moment

HENRY IV (CONTD)
I feel my life is nearing its
natural end and yet still even I
must appear of ruder health than
you

doesn’t respond He continues looking his father in the eye

HENRY IV (CONTD)
The time has come for me to
consider the issue of my
succession You will not be king

remains fixed A barely concealed smirk on the face of Grey

HENRY IV (CONTD)
While you are my eldest son for
reasons that must be evident to
you that are on display for all
here to see and smell you will not
inherit this crown

HAL
Nor have I sought it

HENRY IV
That privilege and responsibility will
instead fall to your brother Thomas

Thomas straightens postures regally It doesn’t suit him

HENRY IV (CONTD)
As you may be aware - to whatever
degree you are aware of the world
outside your own - I will assume
you are aware that the kingdom is
at war with itself Matters as
grave as these require leadership
committed to their resolution and
you - of this I am sure - you can
not provide that commitment
Thomas however can He is soft
but he is eager and he will lead my
army against the newly treasonous
Percy Hotspur

Hal looks at Thomas who has trouble meeting Hal’s eyes

HENRY IV (CONTD)
I will assume this news comes to
you as neither surprise nor
disappointment I do however see it
as my duty as King and as father to
say it to you directly

Hal walks to Thomas Thomas raises his head holds Hal’s
eyes

HAL

How do you feel brother
THOMAS

Strong
HAL

When do you fight

THOMAS
I set off tomorrow We fight by
week’s end

HAL
You need not fight These feuds
need not be yours

Hal takes Thomas’s face in his hand Thomas leans his head
away and tries to stare at Hal He is young and afraid

HENRY IV
I have said what you were summonsed
to hear Leave us now

Hal turns to his father one last cold look then leaves

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - NIGHT

Slow-motion Falstaff is drunk dancing in women’s clothing
owning the room with his sweaty heft Other drinkers laugh

Hal sits in the corner oblivious and darkly contemplative

EXT FIELD ENGLAND - MORNING
A foggy field Men in armour horses an air of trepidation

Thomas is helped into his breastplate by an AMROURER He’s
nervous He raises his arm as a strap is tightened A CAPTAIN
waits nearby

THOMAS
(pained)
Is it not too tight

ARMOURER
It has been made to the
measurements I was given sire

THOMAS
May be you were given the wrong
ones It feels tight I can barely
turn

ARMOURER
It is to be worn tight sire

Thomas steps away like he’s trying on new shoes He seems
awkward in his heavy suit overwhelmed by it He walks among
men nearby He smiles wanly The men regard him with
uncertainty

THOMAS’S CAPTAIN
My lord we must meet with your
marshals As the sun rises the day
will unfold We must complete our
preparations

THOMAS
Of course
EXT TENTS FIELD ENGLAND - MORNING
Thomas enters the circle of seated men awaiting him They bow

their heads but clearly doubt his skill and experience and
worry about their own fate as a consequence

THOMAS
Lord Dorset are your men ready for
the day

DORSET

They are sire

THOMAS
Very good
(awkward beat)
Tell me of your preparations

- and then a commotion from beyond the tents
Hal approaches slowly on horseback A lone muscular figure

A hush descends To most here Hal is an almost mythical figure -
the renegade son of their tyrannical king

He dismounts He walks to Thomas The crowd parts for him He
looks sharp determined steely

THOMAS (CONT’D)
Why are you here

HAL
I will not allow this havoc to
transpire I have come to see it
stopped

THOMAS
This is my battle You have no
place here

HAL
If I have my way there will be no
battle
Hal turns to a HERALD nearby

HAL (CONT’D)
You Come here

THOMAS
You have no place here
HAL
(to herald)

Go to the rebel camp and deliver
this message to Percy Hotspur Tell
him that Prince Henry challenges
him to settle today’s score man on
man He and I We fight in our
armies’ places

THOMAS
I do not need you to fight my
battles

HAL

This battle is not yours
The herald hasn’t moved confused Hal steps towards him

HAL (CONT’D)
Why have you not moved Go

The herald scurries away Dorset rises from the circle

DORSET
Who do you think you are

HAL
I am nobody to you As you are
nobody to me

As Hal walks away he watches the herald’s horse gallop across
the field toward the rebel camp
INT TENT REBEL CAMP ENGLAND - MORNING

Hotspur stands Northumberland sits Scrope is there having
defected from the King’s inner circle

HOTSPUR
I will fight him I will defeat him

NORTHUMBERLAND
That you surely would my son

HOTSPUR
I will defeat him and we can leave
this field whole and victorious

SCROPE

That thrill of victory you so
foresee would be short lived for
there is little chance that the
King Henry would allow us walk free
from this field He would have us
forever marked as traitors and we
would spend the rest of our days
awaiting his recrimination

HOTSPUR
The offer has been made

SCROPE
The Prince Henry speaks not for his
father Of this I am certain You
have started something we have
started something much larger here
and we must see it properly
concluded

NORTHUMBERLAND
Youre eager to fight my son And
you will And we shall fight
alongside you We will burn them
We will burn Henry’s reign to the
ground

EXT TENTS FIELD ENGLAND - MORNING

Hal is fitting himself with armour He does so solemnly and
meticulously These may be his last moments alive

Thomas approaches him furious

THOMAS
It is unconscionable that you
should seek to commandeer this
moment of mine This moment belongs
to me

HAL
This is not a battle you should be
compelled to fight These troubles
are not of your making

THOMAS
This is not for you to decide This
is not your place

HAL
You do not know war Thomas

THOMAS
I do know war

HAL
You do not You may have skirted
its perimeter but you have not
been inside it such as that which
brews here on this field And this
here is not a place any sane or
good man should aspire to know

Hal looks at Thomas hoping he can see his sincere concern

HAL (CONTD)
You have been recruited to our
father’s madness to wars that need
not be fought When I turned my
back on him on my birthright I
was turning my back on this field
These men are not our enemies but
our father has made them thus

THOMAS
Why then are you here You so
disapprove of our cause and yet
still you find it necessary to
upstage me

HAL
I do this not to steal your
thunder brother I do it to save
your life

THOMAS
These are not your decisions to make

Westmorland approaches John turns agitated

WESTMORLAND
Pardon me my lords

THOMAS
What is it

WESTMORLAND
Our herald is returned from the
rebel camp They have refused
Prince Henry’s offer

Thomas is stunned silent

EXT FIELD ENGLAND - DAY

A line of two thousand men and horses - a battle-ready army Far
across the field the thin line of Hotspur’s force is visible

Thomas strides to Dorset and other officers All is quiet
DORSET
You should address the men my lord

- as is customary

THOMAS
Of course

Thomas looks around at the mass of men before him They watch
him He clears his throat

THOMAS (CONTD)
Men This day shall be a glorious
one It shall be a day that will
live on in our memories for many
years to come

Beat Thomas looks nervously at the men staring back him
cold distrustful His pause is awkward long He continues
weakly

THOMAS (CONTD)
Battles such as this one are the
pillars upon which a man’s life is
built

Thomas stops A murmuring from the men Dorset leans in
close

DORSET
You must speak up sire The men
are having difficulty hearing you

Thomas is rattled embarrassed He steels himself and then
loudly yelling uncomfortably -

THOMAS
I know that many of you doubt me I
know many of you think me unworthy
of your respect But I promise you
that today from this moment I
will do everything in my power to
make myself worthy of your respect

Awkward silence The men wait for more None comes

EXT REBEL CAMP ENGLAND - DAY

Rebel preparations Hotspur is now in formidable knight’s
armour elaborate and fearsome He seems troubled He dons
his helmet and mounts his horse also decked in intimidating
armour Together they look powerfully murderous

Hotspur looks around the camp a moment breathing deep behind
his visor He then spurs his horse hard and gallops away
across the field towards the English army Startled
attendants call after him

EXT FIELD ENGLAND - DAY
Thomas stands weak before his men

OFFICER
Loke There

All turn to see Hotspur’s lone sharp approach across the field

Hotspur rides steadily towards Thomas’s army As he nears he
slows then stops close to the line He removes his helmet

HOTSPUR
Where is Henry I have come to
fight him in our armies’ stead

Thomas steps forward distressed and angry

THOMAS
No His offer was refused We are
ready

HOTSPUR

The offer has been reconsidered I
will fight Henry The outcome of
that fight shall stand for the
larger battle forestalled It will
be done

Hotspur dismounts his horse

THOMAS
I said no It will not be done

Hotspur walks closer
HOTSPUR
Why is the little dog barking
Where be the big dog

Hal steps forward helmet under his arm sword by his side

HAL
It will be done
THOMAS
No
HAL

If this here might prevent the
death of countless of your men then
you should wish it be done You
should wish it be done

Thomas can feel the heavy stare of men who would rather not
die many of whom are themselves unsure of this battle’s aim
Hal watches him a moment then steps further towards Hotspur

HOTSPUR
And here I am with the whoring
fool

HAL

This fight need not be had Percy
My father will soon be dead and
your grievances will die with him

HOTSPUR
Don’t be afraid of our small
contest little Hal I promise to
finish it quickly

Hotspur dons his helmet Hal watches him

Hal dons his own helmet He stands firm raises his sword
Hotspur advances calmly Hal circles him

HOTSPUR (CONTD)
Your father is plague to England

Hal charges forward swinging his sword
Hotspur blocks and deflects him easily Hal stumbles
Hotspur stands calm and cocksure as Hal regathers

HOTSPUR (CONTD)
Come for me big dog

Hal attacks again this time steadier more sure-footed
They trade blows Hotspur is a powerful and battle-fit warrior

Hal seems more troubled by the contest struggling to keep his
feet and trade blows

They fight separate and circle each other

Despite his ascendency Hotspur seems surprised by the fight Hal
puts up He expected the win to be easier He concentrates hard

Northumberland and Scrope have arrived on horseback from the
rebel camp They watch the fight

Another vicious exchange The men break They watch each
other catching breath

They circle one another

HOTSPUR (CONTD)
Come for me again dog

Hal raises his sword and stands firm and waits Hotspur fixes
coldly on him then charges The exchange is brutal Hal loses
his sword He stands vulnerable He pulls his dagger from its
scabbard

Hotspur laughs from behind his visor then charges again

Hal ducks spins Hotspur trips and falls Hal wheels around and
thrusts his dagger straight through Hotspur’s throat

Hotspur is killed Hal stands over him heaving for breath

The massed English army bearing witness stand silent
shocked relieved confused - certainly they didn’t want to
die but many felt a greater allegiance to Hotspur than they
did the family they were to fight for today

Hal pulls off his helmet He tosses it on the dirt He bends and
lifts Hotspur’s helmet off He contemplates Hotspur’s lifeless
face He seems saddened by it

Hal carries Hotspur’s helmet over to Thomas All watch
silent

He drops the helmet at Thomas’s feet

HAL
Some day this will be your head
dropped at the feet of a man who
might otherwise have been your
brother Walk away from this field

THOMAS
After you have stolen its prized
scalp This is what shall be spoken
of tomorrow This field was mine
it was to mark my dominion Instead
now it marks only this head This
fucking head

Thomas kicks Hotspur’s helmet like a football and walks away
through the crowd
INT BEDROOM TAVERN EASTCHEAP - NIGHT 21

Falstaff is asleep in bed snoring A knock at the door The door
opens - it’s hostess Hooper

FALSTAFF
Go away

HOOPER
You might wish to see to your
otherwise well appointed friend He
seems to have taken a pitiful turn

EXT STREET EASTCHEAP - MOMENTS LATER 22

Falstaff steps into the dark quiet street to find Beale trying
to rouse Hal who lies drunk and sick against a wall

BEALE
Hal’s up-chucked again

Falstaff crouches before Hal Beale steps away

FALSTAFF
Hello friend What’s this foul
mess you’ve chosen to lie in

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - LATER 23

The tavern has emptied Hal sits against a wall with a sick
bucket Falstaff sits beside him staring ahead

FALSTAFF
Battle is ugly brother Many times
have I seen men in your state I’ve
been in it many times over myself
For all our rejoice of courage and
valour nothing stains the soul
more indelibly than killing Never
have I felt more vile than standing
victorious on a battlefield The
thrill of victory fades quickly
What lingers long after is always
ugly Nothingness Ugly

Falstaff sits remembering war He shudders shakes it off

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
Never again I say

HAL
Stop Stop talking old man

Falstaff smiles and pats Hal on the shoulder

FALSTAFF
I will never stop talking Hal

Falstaff stands and heads for the stairs

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - MORNING
Hal is asleep on the floor A gloved hand shakes his shoulder

VOICE
My lord

Hal wakes William stands over him accompanied by a guard

HAL
What business

WILLIAM
It is a matter of great urgency

HAL
You should hurry along then

WILLIAM
Please my lord

Hal sits up It’s a struggle His head is throbbing
WILLIAM (CONTD)

Your father my lord He is gravely
ill

HAL
That hook has lost its worm

Hal massages his temples William addresses his guard

WILLIAM
Wait for me outside

The guard exits William sits on a bench beside Hal

WILLIAM (CONTD)
England needs a king

HAL
England may do better without one

WILLIAM
No doubt your father has brought
much trouble to this kingdom but I
fear the chaos that might erupt in
his absence England needs a king
and I suspect those sentiments of
yours that had you resile from him
might be precisely those the
governance of this land needs
You must be king

HAL
Why do you say this to me Speak to
Thomas Is he not to be your new

king

WILLIAM
I’m afraid that is not possible my
lord

William pauses Hal looks at him suddenly concerned
WILLIAM (CONTD)
Your brother was killed in Wales
not a week gone by After your
defeat of Lord Percy young Thomas
pressed on to the western fields
This is where he met his end
The news rocks Hal
WILLIAM (CONTD)
It is said he gave valiant account
of himself

Hal stands and heads for the door William watches Hal’s exit

Soon he will have it

The King lies prone in bed breathing shallow face contorted

ARCHBISHOP
He’s dying

HAL
Leave then It’s too late for you

ARCHBISHOP
I give him comfort -

HAL
(yelling furiously)
Get away

The Archbishop backs away scurries for the door

Hal grabs the sheets from the bed and pulls them off He stands
over his dying father shrivelled and exposed on the bed

HAL (CONT’D)
You deserve no comfort

The King struggles for breath wracked with fear He is crying

HAL (CONT’D)
Do you feel the cold

Hal waits for some kind of response Henry is distraught
HAL (CONTD)
(yells)
Speak Do you feel this cold

The King stares into some middle distance broken and childlike

HAL (CONTD)
Speak

Hal starts crying now And then his anger rises again

HAL (CONT’D)
Speak wretch Speak to me

Courtiers sit quietly cautious The King whimpers
HENRY IV
(barely intelligible)
You must be king my son Please I
love you

Hal takes this in His tears run harder The King wheezes

HENRY IV (CONTD)
I know not what I have done

He continues to wheeze as he fades Hal looks to the crown
sitting on a beside table He stares at it

Others in the room wait uncomfortably staring at Hal’s back
Hal stands He turns All stoop apprehensively to a knee

ALL
My liege

Hal stands before them

HAL
Look at me

The men look up He looks them all square He has hardened

HAL (CONTD)
He will be dead by morning

No one breathes Hal watches them - his world shifting

HAL (CONTD)
You know not what will become of
you
(beat)
And so I offer you now the most
blessed reprieve and the most
dreadful misery - one and same -
that you shall suffer the indignity
of serving me the wayward son you
so revile

Hal stares them down
HAL (CONTD)
But know now that you will be
watched over by an altogether
different king
Pause The men genuflect again
HAL (CONTD)
Before you falsely honour your new
king you might with fondness
farewell your old

and two guards enter to find Falstaff startled awake and

disoriented in Hal’s bed

FALSTAFF
What is this

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Who are you

FALSTAFF
I am I Who are you

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
What is your purpose here

FALSTAFF
I think you just woke me up from it
didn’t you

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Rise from that bed At once

FALSTAFF
Who are you Where is Hal

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
These lodgings and their contents
are the property of the King of
England You are trespassing and I
order you to vacate at once

Falstaff is momentarily taken aback He scoffs

FALSTAFF
What King of England

INT KING’S BEDCHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Dressers fit Hal in ceremonial robes William sits watching The
Lord Chamberlain is there too at attention

WILLIAM
Are you comfortable

Hal adjusts his garments He isn’t comfortable

WILLIAM (CONTD)
You need only follow the
Archbishops lead A coronation is
one such event at which the King
need be little more than present
And awake I suppose

(beat)

Many hours might this day consume
but like any other it will end
You are an honourable man You will
not be alone in your endeavours I
can assure you of this You shall
have me beside you at every turn

EXT WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

Hal walks barefoot in ceremonial procession through a crowd
of noble onlookers William Dorset and Westmorland are with
him The Archbishop leads Hal seems vulnerable The crowd
watches with quiet reserve He may have inherited the
kingdom but it feels today as though the kingdom owns him

INT WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
The abbey is huge and full of peers and nobility watching -

Hal on all fours on the chancel disrobed wearing only
breeches The Archbishop stands over him massaging oils into
his arms back and shoulders Hal seems vulnerable
submitting to the arcane unsettling almost sexual ceremony

Bishops bear witness The crowd watches in silence

LATER Hal clothed in full regal attire sits on a throne by
the altar The Archbishop addresses the large crowd

ARCHBISHOP
Will ye sirs at this time give
your wills and assents to this
consecration whereunto the people
shall say with a great voice yea
yea yea so be it King Henry
King Henry King Henry

CROWD
King Henry King Henry King Henry

The crown of Saint Edward is placed upon Hal’s head In
procession he is kissed by each of the bishops as he stares
out at his inscrutable subjects

INT GREAT HALL ROYAL COURT - NIGHT

Hal stands at a huge banquet table flanked by William the Duke
of York Dorset Westmorland Grey and Cambridge A few seats
from Hal sits the Archbishop In all forty or more Dukes and
duchesses Men of church war and politics - and beside some of
these men women sit watching the new king carefully

Among them is QUEEN PHILIPPA Hal’s 21 year-old sister who -
in marriage - is now Queen of Denmark Norway and Sweden She
sits beside her husband ERIC OF POMERANIA

Laid out on a side-table near Hal is a great pile of gifts
Servants remove plates from the table A meal has been eaten

The Lord Chamberlain presents one of the gifts to Hal

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
From Wenceslaus King of Bohemia

Hal opens the box and pulls out an ornate vase He inspects it

LORD CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
(reading from a card)
‘I King Wenceslaus of Bohemia
present this gift to King Henry of
England To long and good health’

HAL
Beautiful

Hal looks to Philippa He walks round the table to her

HAL (CONTD)
As I’m sure you all know my young
sister Philippa has joined us here
today Queen of Denmark

Hal stands behind her He lovingly holds her shoulder

HAL (CONTD)
I am thankful that she and her
husband the good King Eric have
travelled all this way to wish me
well To wish England well

(to Eric)

How stands she Eric As queen I
hope nobly

ERIC
Well she stands Your Majesty

HAL
I’m happy to hear it I wish for
you take this vase my dear Let
its beauty stand for your beauty
which stands in turn for England’s
beauty

Hal puts the vase on the table before Philippa and kisses her
cheek She smiles

PHILIPPA
I thank you my liege

Hal returns to his seat

HAL
The next surprise Lord Chamberlain

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
From Zsigmond King of Hungary
(reading card)
‘May your reign be peaceful and
your kingdom eternally prosperous’

Another box Hal opens it Inside is a quill and ink pot
inspects it

HAL
A quill A nice one
(to William)
I feel you should have this gift
Chief Justice for the signing of
royal decree Let it represent
England’s lawfulness

WILLIAM
Thank you my liege

All at the table enjoy this display of largesse from Hal
are smiling awaiting the next surprise

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
His sincerity the Doge and the
republic of Venice present this
gift in your honour my liege

Hal inspects the box trying to figure out how it opens

LORD CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
(reading the gift letter)
It says it is a bird from
Constantinople

HAL
A bird A dead one I should suppose
if it has travelled here from
Constantinople by Venezia in this
box

Hal

All

Laughter at the table Hal manages to open the box

a small intricately crafted metal bird
Hal studies it

WILLIAM
If I may my liege

Inside is

Hal hands the bird to William William inspects its underside
and twists a dial there He places the bird down on the table
upon which it flaps its wings like the wind-up toy it is

All at the table gasp enthralled horrified watching the
bird twist and flap They’ve never seen anything like it

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Unnatural mechanics from the edge
of Christendom

Hal watches the bird with fascination as it comes to a stop
He picks it up turns it over inspects its underside

HAL
A wonder Well this belongs to
my old friend Lord Cambridge

Hal walks around the table to Cambridge’s seat He puts the bird
on the table before him and clasps him by the shoulders

HAL (CONTD)
Of all at this table none have I
known longer than I have you I
have indeed known you longer than I
have my own young sister

Hal smiles at Philippa She smiles back carefully Hal
returns his attention to Cambridge

HAL (CONTD)
We were raised together We played
games together We have fought in
battle together You have been like
an older brother to me And so in
honour of this I think it only
fitting that you my good Lord
Cambridge should have this magical
bird from Constantinople Let’s
hope its magic isn’t black and
unholy Constantinople indeed

Hal kisses Cambridge’s temple as all laugh and applaud Hal
returns to his seat as Cambridge inspects his new toy

HAL (CONT’D)
More

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
From Charles King of France

The Lord Chamberlain inspects the card

LORD CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
Pardon me Not from the King It’s
from the Prince his son The
Dauphin

The Lord Chamberlain turns the card over

LORD CHAMBERLAIN (CONT’D)
No message

HAL
No message from the Dauphin

Hal puts the small chest on the table before him He opens it
and freezes staring into the box

All wait in anticipation They sense something wrong
Hal reaches into the box and pulls out an old-style tennis ball

HAL (CONTD)
A ball

Silence This is clearly an insult to the new king

HAL (CONTD)
There is no accompanying message

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
No my liege

Hal continues looking at the ball He closes the chest

HAL
I shall keep this gift This one is
sent for me

He examines the ball turns it in his hand

HAL (CONT’D)
For the boy that once I was

Hal steps back from the table and throws the ball hard against
the stone wall It echoes loud and bounces back to him

HAL (CONTD)

The Prince and I might play a set
one day

(to Cambridge)
You shouldn’t mind Lord Cambridge
if I found myself a new play
friend would you For jeu de
paume

Muted laughter Cambridge smiles politely The women - Hal’s
sister Philippa especially - watch Hal closely

HAL (CONTD)
Lord Chamberlain Next Make this
one a good one please

We hold on Hal as the Lord Chamberlain sorts uncomfortably
through the remaining gifts

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
From The King of Denmark Eric of
Pomerania -

HAL
(flat)
Ah good Eric I was hoping yours
might be next

As the Lord Chamberlain reads the card Hal becomes distant

INT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal sits at the King’s desk examining a mess of papers
William sits unsettled holding the Dauphin’s ball

WILLIAM
We must respond This ball is an
insult to you and to your kingdom

HAL
Remember where as Prince I whiled
and how I spent my days

WILLIAM
You spent them in considered
privation

HAL
And drinking Drinking and
clowning So is there not some
truth in this jest If the Dauphin
wants from me a paroxysm why give
it him

WILLIAM
It would not be a show of foul
temper for you to respond
forcefully to an insult such as
this my liege It would be a show
of strength

HAL
I appreciate your umbrage William
And your loyalty

(MORE)

HAL (CONTD)
But my strength does not lie in me
flapping up and down at the
slightest barb like some unholy
mechanical bird

Hal focusses on the papers spread before him William sits
beside him waiting Hal stops rubs his eyes

HAL (CONTD)
(re the papers)
Make sense of this This is what is
pressing

WILLIAM
It’s most complicated my liege
Civil strife has consumed us War
drains the purse like little else

HAL
This strife must end And it will
end by conciliation We shall
pardon our adversaries Lord Scrope
among them We shall pay Mortimer’s
ransom and have him returned from
Wales I will write these pardons
in mine own hand I want it known
these sentiments are so personal to
me We shall let these men know
they were my father’s enemies not
mine

WILLIAM
Certainly my liege

HAL
(beat)
How does this strategy greet you

WILLIAM
Great policy shifts are best
enacted with regime change If this
is how you wish to proceed - and I
will support you in that endeavour
if it be so - then yes my liege
now would be the time to do it

EXT GARDEN ROYAL COURT - DAY
Hal is with his sister Philippa in the palace gardens They

stand at the fence of a pen holding two Bactrian camels
Philippa is enchanted She’s never seen anything like them

Behind them at respectful distance attendants hover - some
armed Hal throws a stick for two dogs to fetch

Philippa is smiling Their talk has been light and tender

PHILIPPA
He is kind to me I’m happy there
I am yet to give him a child but
he seems not to mind

HAL
He is a good man And you are
young

PHILIPPA

Did you reconcile with our father
before his passing

HAL
There was no reconciliation to be
had His passing itself was my
reconciliation He did untold harm
to this kingdom His passing will
bring calm with it

PHILIPPA
I ask not after the kingdom What
of you

HAL

I want an end to this unrest

Beat He hasn’t answered her question

Hal looks

PHILIPPA

I look around that table last
night I look at the faces of the
men seated at it And I can feel
this calm of which you speak I can
see the the hope that your
vitality and your measure
promises them I do believe they
wish you well

(beat)
But I also see that they have their
own kingdoms - behind their eyes
Do you understand what I say

at her
PHILIPPA (CONTD)

These men are more than mere empty
vassels awaiting your instruction

Hal looks away She searches his face trying to read it

PHILIPPA (CONTD)
I know them not I’ve been away too
many years And I’m now to return
to Denmark But I have in my time
in that court been privy to its
commissions I have seen there
again and again that no one ever
speaks true - wholly true Even
when their intentions are virtuous
and their hopes for the realm are
honourable they are still first
and foremost the sovereigns of
their own kingdoms - the kingdoms
of their own imagining

Hal’s shoe’s buckle has come loose He crouches to re-fasten
it Philippa stands over him She looks at him sadly

PHILIPPA (CONTD)
Choose your steps wisely dear
brother Tis likely not my place to
offer you counsel But that is my
counsel nonetheless Abstract as it
may be

Hal looks up as Philippa wanders away Hal watches her
suddenly feeling strangely alone

INT GREAT HALL ROYAL COURT - DAY

Full sitting of parliament The Archbishop has set up an
easel for a presentation On it is an incomprehensibly
complicated genealogical diagram He has performance jitters

All are assembled When Hal enters with William all stand
HAL
Archbishop a presentation I’m
told A performance
The Archbishop bows Hal sits
ARCHBISHOP

Yes my liege Please make
yourself comfortable

HAL
Comfortable How long is this
performance to be

Awkward pause The Archbishop isn’t good at playful banter

ARCHBISHOP

I speak to King Charles of France’s
claim to be the legitimate
sovereign ruler of said lands Tis -

(trying to control lisp)
Tis said that the law Salic would
have no succession of the French
crown fall to a woman Meaning no
rule left in the lineage of the
female shall by rights pass to her
issue The French have long
stripped such titles in favour of
another whence the title was in
fact left in the female thread in
the absence or death of a male
heir Now the law Salic which is
of Salic land and tethered to said
lands is not ah not therefore
legally bound - or adherent at all
in fact - to the lands of France
But to those of Salic Which as
you know lies between the lands of
Elba and of Salve I claim here
with proof that hence it follows
that the law Salic which has seen
French sovereignty stolen as such
from a true lineage Thrice as I
can illuminate the French have
cited the law Salic as reason to
bar a female succession -

HAL
With reverence

ARCHBISHOP
Yes my liege

HAL
You have yet to introduce your
extraordinary puzzle picture there
and already I’m finding this story
impossible to follow

ARCHBISHOP
My liege I question the French
King’s claim to the throne upon
which he sits
The Archbishop flummoxed looks to others for

Beat Hal

Beat

HAL
Is that so What confuses me now is
why you are telling me this story

HAL (CONT’D)
Archbishop I’m sorry Have I
muddled you

ARCHBISHOP
My liege I simply hope to bolster
your claim to France should the
need to meet her with force soon
arise

is unsettled by talk of war

HAL
And you believe that need will
indeed soon arise

ARCHBISHOP

I ah my liege - by way of
preparedness I think it I believe
it always wise -

HAL

Preparedness If we are to war with
France it will be driven by
matters hot and current I thank
you for your performance I’m sorry
to cut it short But war will not
come as a consequence of old and
impenetrable libretto

ARCHBISHOP
France was your father’s long held
ambition Had he not been bogged in
civil feud he would most surely
have taken the fight to her And
then on to Jerusalem

HAL
Jerusalem We’re all the way to
Holy Land are we And to sack the
rest of Christendom along the way
I presume

ARCHBISHOP
My liege -

support

HAL

I am not my father Archbishop I
would have thought this clear by
now

(beat steely)
Do not think me a sapling
gentlemen Do not think I might
bend to light wind Only with a
storm will I uproot Until then
Well acted

Hal stands and leaves The Archbishop looks stung

EXT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal sits in an armchair contemplative William sits nearby

WILLIAM
The Archbishop is a far from gifted
orator

HAL

Which is strange given I would have
thought gifted oratory to be a
requirement of the position Why is
the Archbishop speaking to me of
war with France

WILLIAM
What you are witnessing here is a
stirring Of which we must be wary
I applaud your restraint my liege
After so many years of strife you
are proving to be more than your
father’s son And this is
admirable And sage You wish to be
a king for the people We must
ensure to that end however that
you do not remain oblivious to the
mood of the people

HAL
And what mood is this

WILLIAM
That France is taunting us

HAL
Do you share this mood

WILLIAM
My opinion matters not My loyalty
is to you my liege Unwavering
(MORE)
WILLIAM (CONTD)
I stand by you The mood is a
fantasy That doesn’t mean it isn’t
felt true

to shoo away a persistent scavenging dog

He finishes pulls up his breeches and joins Beale
nearby They walk The street is busy and filthy as

FALSTAFF
Why in heavens a dog would want to
eat my shit I cannot fathom Why
would it not eat its own shit if it

I had a taste for my own shit I’d
need never search for food again

BEALE
Dogs do eat their own shit I seen

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - DAY

Falstaff and Beale enter the tavern It’s busy despite the

makes it half way across the room before he is

HOOPER

FALSTAFF
Yes

Hooper makes her way across the room to him as he takes a
seat at a table with other men

HOOPER
No

FALSTAFF
Yes

HOOPER

You’re not welcome here Unless
youve come to pay what you owe me

FALSTAFF
I’ve paid you

HOOPER
Youve paid me a snatch of what you
owe And I presume too from the
proceeds of thieving

FALSTAFF
Lies

HOOPER
And so by all account you be not
specially good at thieving neither

FALSTAFF
Lies How dare you so address me
Why would you be so churlish with
the very man most likely to lift
you from this stinking rat-hole
Maybe youve forgot but my
associations now stretch to the
highest reaches of the realm Your
insolence might as well be directed
to the King himself Ponder that
now

HOOPER
Are you speaking of Hal

Falstaff haughty pretends the question is beneath him

HOOPER (CONTD)
Where is he Where is Hal Where is
our King

(MORE)

HOOPER (CONTD)
He be gone weeks and weeks now
Where is he I would say you be the
one who’s been forgot I would say
your dalliance with the upper
reaches of the realm were short-—
lived in and around his stinking
sick bucket Seems you were little
more than passing keeper of a
prince’s puke Ponder that now

Men at the table laugh Falstaff is embarrassed

BEALE

Nell Sir John is down on his luck
FALSTAFF

I am not
HOOPER

You find someone to pay your way
here I’1ll not be paying it for you

Hooper walks away leaving Falstaff embarrassed

INT HALLWAY TO DUNGEON ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal walks at pace with two sentries They head down a spiral
stair past guards into a dark and dank corner of the
palace A buzz in the air Hal is concerned

INT DUNGEON ROYAL COURT - MOMENTS LATER

Hal is led into the dungeon Guards loiter William is there
William looks to the guards They exit Hal sits opposite
GILRICH an effete Frenchman in chains Hal and Gilrich

will speak to each other in French subtitled

HAL
Who are you

The man says nothing He looks to William

WILLIAM
He seeks asylum in return for his
tale

HAL

I do not doubt this can be
arranged

GILRICH
Can it or not You are the King
no

Beat Gilrich and Hal size each other up

HAL
It can be arranged

GILRICH
I have been sent by the King of
France to assassinate you

HAL
Charles himself sent you You know
this to be certain

GILRICH
The order’s origin I know yes
From the King

HAL
What was the order

GILRICH
That I should kill the King of
England

HAL
How

GILRICH

However Any way How many ways to
kill a man Tis my talent - killing
men who do not expect to be killed

Hal contemplates his prospective killer

HAL
In return for this admission you
seek impunity and sanctuary here in
England

GILRICH
Oui Yes
INT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal with William Dorset Cambridge Grey Westmorland - and
Scrope newly returned from his rebel defection

DORSET
This is an act of war

SCROPE
The man we have chained now is but
a coward Maybe he was too low
paid Whatever his grievance he
was sent Which means another may
come And I fear the next may be of
firmer mettle than the weasel that
nests in the dungeon beneath our
feet

HAL
At such a time as I endeavour to
foster a fresh and peaceful air for
this kingdom to breathe it is not
in my interest to stir hostility
with another I would expect you
Lord Scrope to understand this as
well as any other I have welcomed
you back to this court so as to
forge quite the opposite of
whatever bellicose fever it was
that had you turn your arms against
it

Scrope looks at Hal with defiance He has indeed been
welcomed back - only to be shut down William breaks tension

WILLIAM
Understand we do my liege but -
with respect - to ignore such an
audacious act of aggression will be
seen as weakness This is no game
ball This is an assassin

HAL
Would you consider me weak Chief
Justice

WILLIAM

Certainly not my liege No I see
the honour in your intent I speak
more of the kingdom of what the
kingdom sees

HAL
Of what the kingdom sees And how
pray might the kingdom see the
weasel beneath our feet

WILLIAM
That weasel is a pimple If
France’s animus towards you runs
deep enough for them to send an
assassin then it will be felt in
the streets ours and theirs It
will be known

Hal feels his leadership tested The other men wait and watch

WILLIAM (CONTD)
We share your concerns my liege
We share your longing for peace
But the stability of peace today
needs more than harmony It needs
strength and confidence These are
qualities that can originate only
in you the King They must be seen
- and felt

Hal looks at William He thinks He turns to an attendant

HAL
Take down these words addressed to
King Charles of France

Hal takes the ball from the Dauphin’s chest He bounces it once
twice on his desk

HAL (CONTD)
This assassin you send can be taken
as nothing other than an infant act
of war If this be your intention
I say you let it be known plainly
and honourably and that you desist
from the timorous slither in which
you presently engage If it be war
you seek send the full weight of
your army for a lone and cowardly
assassin will not topple this King
Henry the Fifth of England you so
underestimate

Hal lifts the chest and empties the tennis balls on the
floor He drops the chest back on his desk

HAL (CONTD)
Fill this with gun-stones and send
it back to France

INT GREAT HALL ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal on his throne A full sitting of parliament A speech is
being given Hal half-listening searches the faces of the
men before him All inscrutable

INT CHAPEL ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal alone on his knees at the altar deep in prayer

EXT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - EVENING

All is ominously still The sky the colour of blood

EXT CAMBRIDGE’S ESTATE - EVENING

A stately manor house in last light A carriage pulls up
outside it A man alights looking around warily

INT CAMBRIDGE’S ESTATE - EVENING

Cambridge steps into the entrance hall to meet his STEWARD at
the front door Cambridge’s children are in the kitchen
behind him There is a wary tension in the air

CAMBRIDGE
Who is it

CAMBRIDGE’S STEWARD
A Frenchman sire He says he
wishes to speak with you privately

CAMBRIDGE
About what

CAMBRIDGE’S STEWARD
He wouldn’t say sire I asked of
him He wouldn’t say

INT PRIVATE CHAMBERS CAMBRIDGE’S ESTATE - NIGHT

The man a French ENVOY takes a seat in Cambridge’s sitting
chamber He waits for the attendant to leave before speaking

ENVOY
My King has sent me to seek out men
he feels he can trust He believes
there is discreet discussion to be
had
CAMBRIDGE
What discussion

ENVOY
He believes there is discussion to
be had about your new King of
England

Cambridge realises he is now in a precarious position

INT ANTECHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Cambridge and Grey with William in a quiet corner

CAMBRIDGE
Only myself and Lord Grey were met
We knew not where to turn about
what was spoken to us

Nervous he looks to Grey who stands eager to cut the

GREY
We are all of us aware that there
is a standing problem Our King is
of low repute

WILLIAM
The French King teaches you this
Is he not thankful for young
Henry’s light reaction to his
provocations Or does he come on
spoiling

CAMBRIDGE
The assassin he swears he knows not
of Tis a charge he denies

WILLIAM
The plot came to nought Of course
he would wish to wipe his hands of
it

fuss
CAMBRIDGE
Whatever the root they have
expressed grave concern regarding
our King’s mental fortitude and
what it might mean for relations
between our kingdoms

William thinks watches Cambridge

CAMBRIDGE (CONTD)
I myself once counted His Majesty a
brother but my lord as you say
much has -

WILLIAM
Is the envoy to be trusted

CAMBRIDGE
I believe so As if you yourself
were to voyage on Henry’s behalf

WILLIAM
Charles wishes to dethrone our King

CAMBRIDGE
They have proffered no course of
action They merely wish to
establish that their concern is
mutually held

GREY
The issue is not France This is
but a reminder to us of a more
general lunacy A man who but weeks
ago was a drunken boor from the
sewers of Eastcheap now wears
England’s crown What shall
become of us What shall become of
us when civil misdeeds are forgiven
as if they were but indiscretions
When traitors are invited to rejoin
the court as if they had been but
away on sojourn When it appears -

WILLIAM
Yes These concerns are current and
numerous Something must be done
And something will be done

INT WILLIAMS CHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal is seated William stands beside his desk

WILLIAM
Thus is the King’s burden A king
must make decisions lesser men are
neither willing nor able to make A
king is indeed presented with
quandaries lesser men might never
encounter in the course of their
whole lives

Hal drops his head stares at the floor

WILLIAM (CONTD)
I wish it were not so But
problems my liege - this is my
experience - problems left
unattended have a habit of becoming
crises You have a chance here to
unite this land truly You have
refreshed its mood with promise
But promise must be fulfilled
Promise can never be an end in
itself

Pause Hal looking at the floor thinking

HAL
One does not secure the integrity
of his house by ignoring the
woodworm
(looks up at William)
Nor by attempting to make peace
with it

INT GREAT HALL ROYAL COURT - DAY
The full court gathered chatting casually William on edge
Hal enters steely The men go silent as they notice him

HAL
As of this day we are at war with
France

Stunned silence Grey and Cambridge shuffle nervously

HAL (CONTD)
Twice I have given her the benefit
of my doubt Once as a trifling
joust which I paid The second I
met with messaged caution This
third will not be left unchecked

DORSET
(beat cautious)
What be this latest provocation to
arouse thy fury my liege

HAL
And so in order to flush these
French rats from their nests I
will have it communicated to them
that we are now at war

Hal stares strangely at the men

HAL (CONTD)
And who do we propose might deliver
this declaration An envoy A man
or men of high standing

Hal steps directly to Cambridge and Grey

HAL (CONTD)
Lords Grey and Cambridge I would
ask you deliver this message to
France given your familiarity with
its recipient but I believe in the
morning you be otherwise engaged

Cambridge nervous waits for Hal to continue Hal doesn’t

CAMBRIDGE
Pray how my liege

Hal looks him square in the eye It’s deep and personal

HAL
Tomorrow you will have your heads
axed off I have chosen to send you
as an advance party to Hell for the
considerable French number that
will soon be needing to find space
there

Hal looks at Cambridge The room is pin-drop still

HAL (CONT’D)
You were once my friend

Cambridge is stunned bewildered

CAMBRIDGE
I am your friend

Hal moves away Grey looks to William who watches him coldly

EXT EXECUTION YARD - DAY 55

Cambridge and Grey on a platform - before them a beheading
block Abject fear on their faces

The full court gathered Hal and William watch steely

A guard pushes Grey forward and onto his knees his neck on
the block Grey breathes hard hyperventilating

CLERGYMAN
May God take pity on you

A moment passes Strange silence The HEADSMAN swings his

axe Grey’s head comes off Blood gushes Hal watches and
then meets Cambridge’s terrified and confused eyes

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - NIGHT

The tavern is busy Noise loud voices in a confined space
The door opens Six armed and masked guards enter and stand
ominously at the entrance The noise dies quickly

GUARD
All leave Now

Scoundrels grab their cloaks and make their way hastily to
the door They file timidly out past the guards

Falstaff sits at a far table watching warily He takes his
scarf and goes to make a quiet exit

GUARD (CONT’D)
You Stay

Falstaff sits again weighing his options as the room empties
Hostess Hooper remains at a table A guard points at her

GUARD (CONTD)
You Leave

HOOPER
This is my place

A hooded figure walks in and stops at the top of the stairs

HOODED MAN
The hostess can stay

The man removes his hood It’s Hal He steps in He approaches
Falstaff Falstaff remains wary watching Hal suspiciously

HAL
That’s my welcome

FALSTAFF
You want me to curtsey That could
take a while with my funny knee
and all First I’d have to stand
Then I’d have to bend over We
could be here all night I think
I’‘1l just stay sitting if it suits
Your Highness

Hal places a purse of coins on the table for Hooper
HAL
For the loss of patronage

(to Falstaff)
I beg a moment of your time

INT TAVERN EASTCHEAP - LATER

Hal and Falstaff sit at a corner table Falstaff drinks ale

HAL
I expect nothing of you I am here
to ask Simply

FALSTAFF

And simply I refuse I won’t jump
to your attention and surely not
to retread vile ground I vowed I
would never walk again A man who
has found it so easy to shed his
skin should find wholly sensible
the sentiments of this here snake

Hal can clearly sense Falstaff’s underlying hurt feelings

HAL
I acknowledge my neglect of you
John I regret it deeply A new
chapter of my life was begun before
the last could be properly closed

FALSTAFF
Why won’t you drink with me

Hal pauses not sure if the question is a thaw in tension

HAL
Drinking is what men do when they
wish to take temporary leave from
life I no longer have this luxury

Falstaff drinks and smiles to himself

HAL (CONTD)

Already I can feel the weight of
this crown I wear I know you
remember I once wished to eschew
both its burden and its
pretensions But to do so now would
be cowardice It is incumbent upon
me to steer a course for the
defence and the betterment of
England This is that course

(beat)
These concerns are mine and mine
alone But the fact that this here
now be the first occasion I’ve had
to sound them aloud to anyone other
than myself speaks volumes It
speaks to the loneliness of the
position in which I find myself To
steer our present course I’ve been
forced to rely upon the counsel of
men whose loyalty I question every
waking moment Every waking moment
I need around me men I trust beyond
doubt - and of them there is only
one on this earth I can identify
with anything near certainty

Hal looks to Falstaff with humility Falstaff reads it

HAL (CONTD)
I expect nothing of you John
Whatever decision you make I will
respect without question But I’m
here because I love you and because
at this point in this chapter I
need that love like I need the air
I breathe I’m here because you are
my friend

FALSTAFF
A king has no friends A king has
only followers and foe

The moment hangs heavy Hal stands and dons his cloak
HAL
I’m sorry that my occasion to visit
carries with it this doleful
weight

Falstaff watches him unmoved Hal heads for the exit Then -

FALSTAFF
Hal

Hal stops and turns

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
I will come with you

Beat Hal watches him

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
I ask only one favour in return

The moment is loaded Falstaff points to Hooper

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
Square my account with this
terrible hag would you

INT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal walks a line of assembled men The full court plus the
Duke of York and handful of others

HAL
We welcome those newly arrived here
Sir Daffydd from Wales

He comes face to face with the noblemen one by one

HAL (CONTD)
Cousin Westmorland Lords Warrick
and Dorset Great men all Turn
us now in common poise with one
mind sharpened Let past
grievances be forgot Our minds
make free to one end Together we
will bring France down Together we
will bring her to her knees

(beat)

Captains all to this end I
introduce you to a new marshal of
our campaign

Hal pauses Anticipation

HAL (CONTD)
Sir John Falstaff

Falstaff steps forward strangely polite and nervous He
wears the best outfit he could muster at short notice He
looks out of place but clean and combed and strong

The other men in the room are confused William is unsettled

HAL (CONTD)
Sir John’s experience in battle
should need no recitation You know
of him Some of you have had the
honour of fighting alongside him
Others have heard tale of his
exploits and his bravery of his
redoubtable command of men But I
have tasked Sir John to join this
campaign for one most vital reason
alone he respects war as only a
man who has seen its most monstrous
form can He lusts after it not
but rather regards it with the grim
sobriety that you and your men
should hope he would You will
listen to him as you would to me
He is my eyes and my ears my heart
and my head

Falstaff on long-estranged ground feels rusty Hal looks to
him to speak which he does without fuss or flower

FALSTAFF
Welcome and thank you good sirs
You are all well met

INT BEDCHAMBER ROYAL COURT - NIGHT

Falstaff is in a bathtub A pageboy sits on a stool beside
the tub massaging Falstaff’s foot which hangs over its edge
He looks uncomfortable Falstaff scrubs his armpit He
squirms and laughs

FALSTAFF
Hard Not soft Hard Be forceful

A knock at the door

FALSTAFF (CONT’D)
Enter

The door opens Hal enters He takes in the scene He closes
the door behind him and takes a seat near the tub

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
I’m having to explain to this
stripling that a soft scrub of the
foot might be construed in some
circles as a tickle

Hal is unsettled by Falstaff’s drunken jocularity

HAL
Are you ready for what awaits us
FALSTAFF
One is never ready for what awaits
us
HAL
Do you prepare yourself as best you
might

Falstaff knows Hal needs reassurance He sobers a pinch

FALSTAFF
You know me well I see first to
the fettle of my humours My wits
depend on it As do yours I
counsel you follow my lead

Hal smiles wearily He’s tired He looks at the pageboy with
his head bowed He stands and heads for the door

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
Rest well my liege

EXT ARMOURY - DAY

Under a foreboding sky a hundred men load supplies into
crates on the backs of horse-drawn drays Blacksmiths hammer
and solder Stockpiles of armour and weaponry are sorted
Macabre instruments of death and destruction The dirty
industrial end of the war machine An imposing enterprise

Around a corner Falstaff is with two lowly conscripts

FALSTAFF
I can’t understand the garble
coming out your mouth hole

HAMMOND
We don’t want to get on that ship
for no war or such

FALSTAFF
You don’t want to get on that ship
for no war or such

HAMMOND
We know you got the position to get
us off it now We don’t want to go
to no war in France

FALSTAFF
So while other men - few of whom I
imagine want to go to war - do so
anyway for their good King has
called to them you imagine I
should grant you some form of
official exemption on account of
your simply not wanting to ‘go to
no war in France or such’ Have I
understood you And what might be
the benefit for me In the gross
violation of order such sympathetic
dispensation would constitute

HAMMOND
What

FALSTAFF
Coin brownface What coin have
you

The conscript pulls a sack of coins from his filthy pocket

HAMMOND
This

Falstaff takes the sack and starts counting coins discreetly

FALSTAFF
What are your names

HAMMOND
Hammond and Horland I’m Hammond
and he’s Horland

FALSTAFF
I don’t care which one of you is
which

Falstaff finishes his count and pockets the sack

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
Right Piss off now Hammond and
Horland

Hammond and Horland scurry away As Falstaff heads back round
to the main yard he looks up and waves to someone

Looking on from across the yard Hal stands watching the
industry He nods reply to Falstaff’s wave William is beside
him Hal looks concerned

WILLIAM
My liege I must ask You believe
Sir John to be fit and suitable
enough to captain this effort

Hal lets this sit The ugly weapons being prepared and packed
portend only blood and death

HAL

This is what we have set in motion
I must know that it will be
captained by men of good intent -
above all else There are few of
whom I know it clear and true

(beat looks at William)
You might be the only other
William You’re a man of good
intent But you’re not a soldier

Hal looks back down at the war preparations
HAL (CONTD)
John is a good man
EXT SHIP - DUSK
Above deck Hal with William Dorset and Falstaff a map laid
out before them Hal is deep in thought The other men watch
him Beyond a huge flotilla of English ships on the channel
HAL
We shall know soon enough They
meet us at sea or upon our landing -
we shall know all in the morning
You must rest

Hal rubs his face deeply The men rise to leave

HAL (CONT’D)
John

As the men file down a ladder to the lower deck Falstaff
waits Hal looks at him Falstaff about to break the silence -

HAL (CONT’D)
Thank you

Hal clearly had something else to say but couldn’t find it

FALSTAFF
For what

HAL
For being here With me

FALSTAFF
Small price to pay to get that
detestable Hooper woman off my back
Hal smiles sadly

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
You too should rest my liege

Falstaff smiles nods and climbs the ladder

INT SHIP BELOW DECK - NIGHT

Falstaff steps down below deck dark and cramped with men He
roams among them - trepidation outright fear on their faces
an eerie quiet under the ship’s creak and groan

Falstaff puts his hand on shoulders makes much eye contact
These looks he has seen on many faces before - the looks of
men who wonder if their remaining lives might now be counted
in hours He tries to reassure with his calm smile but knows
nothing can ever truly assuage their feelings

He takes a seat on a sack of grain at the end of a row of

hammocks He folds his arms watches the men a moment longer
then closes his eyes

EXT BEACH - DAY

Fog A boat grinds its bow onto the sand Hal and Falstaff
in light armour jump into knee deep water and wade ashore
EXT HARFLEUR TOWN - DAY

Over the dunes Hal Falstaff Dorset and a collection of
twenty or so men-at-arms walk warily between seemingly
abandoned farm buildings They tread lightly swords drawn

Two soldiers act as point men ahead

Terrifying stillness No one speaks The town feels freshly
abandoned The mist drifts like smoke through it

A lone donkey wanders aimless The men watch it warily

On the rise beyond a castle looms

EXT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Light rain The English have set up a makeshift camp on the
outskirts of Harfleur Thousands of men and horses Giant
trebuchets are being assembled

EXT TENT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

Hal with Falstaff William Dorset Scrope and Westmorland
They sit by a fire under a canopy slung from a tent

DORSET
We must storm that castle It will
be bloody We will most surely
sacrifice souls Thus is the nature
of war It is bloody and soulless

Hal listens thinking

DORSET (CONTD)
If circumstances were other we
might hold this place to siege but
I fear the march of time is our
second enemy We have no way of
knowing how well supplied they are
behind those walls A siege may
take months and months I fear we
have not at our disposal Our force
is too large to sustain a lengthy
siege We must move Men in these
numbers fixed here will fall to
hunger and disease

Hal takes this in then looks to Falstaff Falstaff spits

FALSTAFF
War is bloody and soulless

Hal looks to the dirt at his feet

EXT HARFLEUR CASTLE - NIGHT

The now assembled trebuchets - huge wooden machines of
medieval warfare - are being armed by English soldiers
working by the light of giant bonfires Once loaded each
trebuchet hurls a terrifying fireball through the dark across
the field to crash into the castle’s walls

Hal stands and watches while fires burn all around him

EXT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

The rain has eased but the sky is grey and the ground muddy
Men are already looking cold wasted forlorn Some eat soup

Hal William and Falstaff stand watching the trebuchets
continue their horrible bombardment on the castle on the
hill Smoke billows from within the walls

WILLIAM
The Archbishop has arrived

From the beach below a small retinue of soldiers approaches
Leading them is the Archbishop Attendants accompany him
holding a canopy over his head Hal watches them waddle
through the mud in full silly clerical regalia

ARCHBISHOP
Your Majesty tis good to see you
well
INT TENT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY
Hal Falstaff William and Dorset sit with the Archbishop
ARCHBISHOP

Surely you can not simply idle here
until they decide to come out

FALSTAFF
That’s precisely the definition of
a siege

ARCHBISHOP

How long might that take Surely
there is no way of knowing

FALSTAFF
That too is a common characteristic
of a siege

HAL
I will not send my men up that
hill

ARCHBISHOP

But why in heavens not

HAL
I will not sacrifice my men so
flagrantly nor so speculatively

ARCHBISHOP
This is war Men die in war

Hal lets this sit He watches the Archbishop coldly

HAL
How fortunate you are to find its
horrors so unexceptional

ARCHBISHOP
Well then why do you not simply go
around If they insist on hiding in
their castle why do you not simply
go around it Let them hide Hiding
is an admission of defeat Take it
as such and we can press on

Hal looks to Falstaff and William to share his bewildered
disdain He turns back to the Archbishop

HAL
And so well versed in the art of
warfare

Hal stands and exits the tent

WILLIAM

(to Archbishop)
We must take this town We must
establish a garrison foothold here
for our lines of supply from
England Simply ignoring the force
behind those walls is entirely
untenable

The Archbishop is uncomfortable speaking candidly in
Falstaff’s presence

ARCHBISHOP
We must expedite these concerns my
lords You understand this Do not
forget that I have underwritten
this campaign I have interest
here And I will be heard

Beat William stands and exits The Archbishop is left to
squirm under Falstaff’s stare

EXT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Hal walks between tents He is startled by the sound of a
distant horn Westmorland approaches out of breath

WESTMORLAND
My liege They have surrendered

William walks to them Hal turns to him

HAL
Our debate now it seems is
irrelevant

The distant horn blows again Hal smiles

HAL (CONT’D)
As are the Archbishop’s bleatings

EXT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Dorset Scrope Westmorland the Archbishop and William stand
beside Hal who sits on his throne under a canopy

The CAPTAIN OF HARFLEUR JEAN D’ESTOUTEVILLE genuflects
before him

D’ESTOUTEVILE
(in French subtitled)
The day is yours We ask only that
our women and children be freed
There are already many hungry and
wounded and becoming sick

HAL

(in French subtitled)
Upon full account of the castle I
see no reason to deny your request
You will have tonight to oversee
this evacuation and to corral your
men prisoners Lord Scrope will
oversee this night and take full
possession of the castle in the
morning

D’Estouteville stands and nods Scrope escorts him away

EXT CAMP HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Falstaff moves through the filthy camp

INT TENT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Falstaff enters Hal is with William Westmorland and Dorset
Hal is on his throne

WILLIAM
I am told it would be but a day
before his arrival Perchance two

DORSET
He wishes to slow us

FALSTAFF
Who wishes to slow us

WESTMORLAND
We have received word that the
Dauphin is en route He wishes
conference with His Highness

HAL
We know nothing of his purpose

WILLIAM
We know only that he desires
conference I would hope his
purpose be to deliver his father’s
early surrender

DORSET
I strongly advise we disregard this
word of his approach and ready our
movement The Dauphin will be in
haste cobbling a bickering army
from all corners We mustn’t let
him dally us We must make
advantage of their disarray

All wait for Hal to speak Hal turns to Falstaff

HAL
Sir John please your counsel

The men look to Falstaff He shrugs

FALSTAFF
I’ve never met the man this French
Prince I can’t speak to his
motivation

The men wait for more from Falstaff None is coming

HAL
We wait one day more After this
the Prince can deliver his message
to us on the move

INT HAL’S TENT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Hal is asleep in his bed The Lord Chamberlain is asleep on

He’s here Can you smell him He has
doused himself in perfume

INT TENT HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

The French Prince THE DAUPHIN LOUIS DUKE OF GUYENNE sits
on Hal’s throne laughing with his men Hal and William
enter Falstaff Westmorland and Dorset are already there
The Dauphin is dressed ostentatiously flamboyant vain

DAUPHIN
Your Majesty Excuse the hour I
have never visited here before I
find we have lost our way
Hal assays the Dauphin and his men

DAUPHIN (CONT’D)
Please sit Or I beg your pardon

He stands
DAUPHIN (CONTD)
You must invite me of course This
is your domain

Hal doesn’t move The Dauphin sits again raises his cup

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
To your little victory

Hal stares

DAUPHIN (CONT’D)
Do you wonder why I have come

The Dauphin looks to Hal then to William and Falstaff then
back to Hal He raises his eyebrows

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
Do you wonder this

Hal stares impassively at the Dauphin

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
I have not come to offer you
surrender if that is what you were
hoping I have come instead to
describe for you your end days the
screams of your men as they die
slow

The Dauphin stares at Hal trying to be intimidating

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
And so King of England you seem
so intent on making France your new
home I will help you I will drain
your body of its blood and I will
bury it under a tree A little
French tree Very young and small
Since perchance that is fitting of
your mind to come here Small And
maybe your -

He gestures to his cock

DAUPHIN (CONT’D)
But no your balls must be big

His humour is forced He smiles a gloating smile to his men

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
A tiny little cock And giant
balls

The Dauphin laughs falsely and loudly then sobers

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
And the sound of your wives and
children weeping I will use to lull
me to sleep at night Oh but of
course there is no one for you To
weep for you No wife or children
No I might just use that thought
to lull me to sleep at night

Falstaff yawns wide and loud The Dauphin is taken aback

FALSTAFF
Pardon me

Hal stares dully at the Dauphin

DAUPHIN
Have you heard what I have said

HAL
I have It was stirring
(to Falstaff)
Sir John walk with me

Falstaff nods and stands Hal puts his hand on Williams
shoulder and smiles to the room

Good night all

EXT CAMP HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Hal and Falstaff walk between tents Hal is dark and
focussed

HAL
Ready the men to move Waste no
time

EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Hal rides the length of his massive army train Weary men
Many are sick with dysentery - archers food carriages
masons livestock And shackled French prisoners on foot
A carriage carries the Archbishop He smiles as Hal passes
Hal ignores him

EXT RIVER SOMMES - DAY

Hal Falstaff and Dorset at a forest’s edge They are joined
by William and attendants

DORSET
We must cross these woodlands We
drift still further north if we
stay along that road

Hal turns to Falstaff who shakes his head

FALSTAFF
I don’t like the smell of these
woods They smell of French prince
Hal looks into the dense thicket Falstaff smells the air

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
Peculiar smell it is

Falstaff ambles off Hal watches him Dorset boils

EXT HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

Sure enough the Dauphin and a handful of his soldiers hide
on the forested rise of the hill flanking the crossing He
watches the English move on He spits and walks away

EXT RIVERSIDE CAMPSITE FOREST - DAY

The English in full swing making camp Tents are raised
Hammers post pegs Horses are freed of their saddles

Hal sits on a crate and pulls his boots off He looks around
Men cough and collapse exhausted

Three BOY ATTENDANTS leave the camp to gather wood and water
Two carry axes one a pail

EXT FOREST - DAY

The boys wander through the forest Shafts of light through
the trees The sound of the bubbling river

Moments later - two of the boys gather kindling

Meanwhile the third boy gets to the river’s edge He scoops
water into his pail When he stands a figure holding a
dagger appears behind him A hand reaches around and grabs
his mouth He is stabbed through the spine The noise -

Alerts the other boys 30 yards away They drop their kindling
and run Two more French soldiers give chase one with a
crossbow

One of the boys is dropped by a crossbow bolt

The other runs straight into The Dauphin standing in wait
with another soldier

The Dauphin’s face is camouflaged with charcoal

He crouches before the frightened boy

DAUPHIN
(in English)
Hello little boy

The boy is practically paralysed with fear

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
Don’t be afraid

Strange beat The Dauphin looks the boy over studies his
face The boy’s fear is mounting tearful sickening

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
Hush now small one Don’t be
afraid You will live I shall have
you deliver a gift to your king

He strokes the kid’s hair

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
Will you do that for me

EXT RIVERSIDE CAMPSITE - LATER

Tight on the blonde boy’s traumatised face as he walks slowly
out of the forest and back into camp At the edge of camp
men notice him and stand back in horror

The boy carries the severed head of the pail boy

INT HAL’S TENT RIVERSIDE CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER
Hal sits boiling Falstaff watches him

HAL
Double the guards to twenty yards
through the night Three hours at a
watch I want these men fresh and
alert Any man caught sleeping will
have his eyes gouged Any caught
speaking will lose his tongue

He looks at Falstaff Falstaff stands

HAL (CONTD)
And I want all French prisoners in
our train put to death Leave their
corpses speared on pikes by the
rivers edge

FALSTAFF
I will heed the first command The
second - you’ll need to carry out
that mass execution yourself

HAL
What did you say to me

FALSTAFF
You are not that man

HAL
How dare you

FALSTAFF
Show your feeling in here with me
But do not let it leave this tent

HAL
How dare you defy me I am your
king I should have you killed
alongside those shackled French
pigs

Hal breaths hard looking at Falstaff with venom

HAL (CONT’D)
And where is the fearsome old
warrior about whom I’ve heard so
much that trumpeted his battle-
smarts to me so loudly You’ve been
mute since we crossed the sea I
seem to be serving as my own chief
tactician my own commander my own
counsel Where is the great warrior
Falstaff

Beat Falstaff is calm He watches Hal fume

FALSTAFF
I speak only when there is
something to be said Too often
have I seen men of war invent work
for themselves work that leads to
nought but vainglory and
slaughtered men I am not that man
And this here is the war you have
chosen to wage

Hal charges Falstaff collars him a knife to his throat
HAL

I will disembowel you right here
with mine own hand

Falstaff stares coolly into Hal’s eyes

FALSTAFF
You’re not that man either

They hold a look Hal fumes then backs down Falstaff exits

EXT RIVERSIDE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

The air is muted Men are in shock Some stare into fires
Others lie still Somewhere in the shadows a man sobs

Falstaff roams among them He lugs a bottle He’s drunk He
has a wild look in his eye

He stumbles upon three men kneeling in prayer eyes closed
He sits and watches them quietly They finish Amen They
open their eyes They notice Falstaff They bow their heads

FALSTAFF
Have you ever had cause to hear the
Archbishop of Canterbury speak

None answer

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
It’s quite a show You’re
prostrated there already I shall
sermonise I’1ll render it for you

Falstaff looks around He finds a bucket He puts it on his
head upended like the Archbishop’s mitre He exaggerates the
Archbishops lisp tongue hanging from his mouth

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
And the Lord saideth I knoweth
thou hath savour for spelt and
sorrel and steer steaks with juices
and sauces But I give you this my
sacred promise I will summons a
great pestilence carried by
serpents on floodwaters - such
unspeakable suffering unspeakable
suffering from which there shall
be no succour - should you forsake
the simple sausage

The men smile wide try to contain their laughter

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
And know that when this pestilence
comes it comes not to smite thee
for thine past sins committed
(MORE)

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
It comes because thou’st forsook my
unassailable love for sausages

Men laugh More gather Falstaff hands off his bottle

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
And when thou’st can find no
sausages thou’st must take to the
seas in ships - sailing ships
splendid sailing vessels - so as
to search for delicious fishes of
all descriptions Salty sea
creatures and shellfish to be
savoured with sesame and ah ah -

SOMEONE
Spinach

FALSTAFF
Spinach Yes indeed Spinaci -

Falstaff chokes and laughs and chokes

EXT RIVERS EDGE - DAY

Falstaff rides in his forward position He hones his eyes
through the trees around them He knows the French are close

Hal rides up to take his position The look they exchange is
cold The air is tense The men are eerily silent

EXT RIVER - LATER

The English train crosses a swamp Horses wade Men struggle
to keep their supplies from tumbling into the water

EXT AGINCOURT - LATER

The train has halted Hal William Dorset and Falstaff
survey the field before them Pristine countryside A gentle
slope to a small hill on its far side Dense forest to the
right and left but in between - a huge empty tranquil field

HAL
Dorset summon your fastest rider

DORSET
Yes my liege

Dorset turns to his ATTENDANTS nearby

DORSET (CONT’D)
Dartmouth

DARTMOUTH skinny like a jockey trots to the group

DARTMOUTH
Sires What can I do for ye

Hal points to the crest of the far hill

HAL
Tell me what lies over that hill Ride
fast and return directly

Dartmouth spurs his horse The men watch him cross the field

EXT FIELD AGINCOURT - CONTINUOUS
Dartmouth rides hard into the wind as he crests the hill

At the top over the other side he can see thousands of
Frenchmen - an army lying in wait An intimidating sight

OMITTED

INT TENT AGINCOURT - EVENING
Passions high William sits quiet Falstaff eats an apple

DORSET
We are both outnumbered and out-
positioned They have the down-
slope in their favour Our need to
advance puts us already at
disadvantage

HAL
The longer we wait the larger
their force will grow And with it
our disadvantage Your archers my
lord are of superior faculty
French crossbows are no match for
an English longbow We should
hobble their number on first
assault by these means alone

DORSET
York’s charge in centre faces four
lines of mounted knights

(MORE )

DORSET (CONTD)
Three of men-at-arms Our archers
here might weaken those by half
But not eight lines Nine Ten
More

Hal can’t argue with this

DORSET (CONTD)
You speak true my liege The
longer we wait the greater our
disadvantage But it is possible
our disadvantage has already grown
insurmountable A great many men
are already desperately ill and
weak from hunger

HAL
(challenging)
What then my Lord do you propose
we do

DORSET
(beat)
I propose we consider turning back
my liege To return again at a
later date stronger better
prepared

Hal stares defiantly but knows opinion runs against him

DORSET (CONT’D)
I know it will not bring the
outcome we desire but nor will the
evisceration of our army I’m
reticent to speak for others here
now but I’m certain my fears are
shared

Hal looks at Dorset a moment longer then -

HAL
Who here agrees with Lord Dorset

Silence No one will admit to it Hal looks around the circle
Men avoid his eyes The silence lingers Until -

FALSTAFF
We can win this battle

All turn to Falstaff He lets the attention soak in He chews
his mouthful of apple

DORSET
Is that so Sir John
FALSTAFF
Yes

Dorset’s patience with Falstaff has worn thin

DORSET
And precisely how is it so Sir
John

FALSTAFF
We fight without horses and without
armour

Dorset throws his arms in the air and looks to the sky

DORSET
Heavens above Please spare us from
this man

FALSTAFF
Their forward defence is a
frontline of mounted men many
deep Knights all All on
horseback all in heavy armour The
ground down there is a floodplain
already half-sodden And when the
rain falls again tonight as I know
it will that ground will turn to a
muddy bog With their horses and
their armour they will get stuck
they will fall and they will
flounder like upturned beetles

WESTMORLAND
As shall we

FALSTAFF
Not if we travel light without
horses and without armour Speed
and mobility will be our advantage
We will pick them off like lame
cattle and that great mound of
fallen French knights will serve as
our battlement

WESTMORLAND
And how on earth can you be sure of
rainfall tonight

FALSTAFF
My left knee is aching - it only
does that when rain is near

DORSET
Oh save us My liege please put
a stop to this drivel

HAL
(ignoring Dorset)
This would require their armoured
frontline come meet us in the mud
How do you propose we invite that

FALSTAFF
A small forward armoured attack of
our own A false advance They will
counter We save our weight and
muscle for a nimble assault from
the flanks

DORSET
They shan’t be so easily deceived
They will not respond to false
attack

Dorset shakes his head incredulous Falstaff smiles and
then suddenly tosses his apple to Dorset Dorset reacts
startled catches the apple

FALSTAFF
They will respond

He has their full attention Dorset fumes drops the apple

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
We move they will meet us in the
mud Our men-at-arms are
outnumbered This they know They
will hope to overwhelm us and so
will meet us with full force no
matter how small our first advance
Our great longbows will rain chaos
upon them from above That chaos
will be our favour

Hal ponders this searching Falstaff’s eyes for motivation

DORSET

My liege I implore you We mustn’t
listen to this madness What is the
true experience of this man He
once fought for Richard Many years
ago Since then he has done nothing
other than ride with the companies
robbing and tormenting

FALSTAFF
I never robbed anyone who didn’t
deserve to be robbed

Beat Hal looks only at Falstaff

HAL
If it rains tonight we fight
tomorrow

EXT FALSTAFF’S TENT AGINCOURT - NIGHT

Falstaff sits alone by a fire outside his tent short of
friends Hal sits beside him and stares into the flame

HAL
If you have concocted this plan
half-baked and speculative merely
to prove to me your worth please
say so now

FALSTAFF
All plans are speculative my
liege

HAL

Please John do not call me that
when we’re alone It makes me feel
as though we are living a fiction

FALSTAFF
Are we not

A loaded moment Hal drops his eyes penitent

HAL
Though you might not think it
possible you are my friend

Falstaff stokes the fire For Hal a disconsolate moment
Falstaff eases it

FALSTAFF
All plans are speculative And as I
say I only speak them when I can
feel them true This one I feel in
my bones This one I can feel in my
kneebone

He smiles Hal shares it Silence Hal stares into the fire

HAL
Here we are on the eve of this
fight and I’m scared to wonder to
tell it true why we are even here

FALSTAFF
You best discover the answer to
that for yourself The men out
there deserve it These are the men
are who are still here These are
the men that tried not to bribe
their way home that chose not to
run to their villages to hide
These men are your willing shadows
Theyve given their lives over to
you

(beat)
I can’t say I know what forces have
conspired to bring you here but
these men need you just as you
need them These men deserve your
confidence If you can not give
them that at least then tell them
a magnificent lie

HAL
Why are you here

FALSTAFF
I’m here because you asked me to
come

Falstaff looks at Hal warmly then pats Hal’s leg and stands

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
Good night Hal Sleep well

Falstaff steps inside his tent leaving Hal alone

Hal looks out over the sprawling camp - small fires dotted
among clumps of cold and tired men shadows in the dark
INTEXT FALSTAFF’S TENT AGINCOURT - DAWN

Falstaff wakes The sound of light rain on the tent

He steps outside looks to the sky feels the drops on his
face

He crouches before an old chest He unlatches and opens it
Inside is a suit of heavy armour He lifts out a helmet He
brushes dust off it and regards it wistfully

INTEXT HAL’S TENT AGINCOURT - MORNING

Hal kneeling in prayer The Lord Chamberlain stands quietly
by Hal stands and exits his tent

William is waiting outside They survey the camp beginning
its preparations

HAL
Is this folly

WILLIAM
As you say my liege I am not a
soldier Tis not for me to question
your instinct I can advise on
strategy not tactic I would say I
fear the pall it should cast on the
vigour of your fresh crown were we
to return home today To be sure
defeat here might cast that same
pall Retreat would guarantee it

EXT ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - MORNING

In amongst the wider battle preparations around the camp
Westmorland briefs a contingent of twenty knights seated and
standing and rumbling with disquiet

WESTMORLAND
These are the King’s orders We are
to fight unarmoured and without
chargers

KNIGHT
We are to be sacrificed Is that
what he asks of us

WESTMORLAND
His belief is that fighting
unarmoured and unmounted will not
only secure us victory it is the
surest way to keep you alive

KNIGHT
Rot

WESTMORLAND
And I will say this if our King
were to ask you to sacrifice
yourself for the greater good of
the realm I’d expect you honour
that request as any loyal and
stouthearted subject should

EXT ARMOURY TENT AGINCOURT - MOMENTS LATER

Hal walks the camp in only the lightest of armour Archers
string bows arrows are bundled Horses sense looming danger
and scuff hoofs in the dirt

Hal rounds a corner to find Falstaff outside the armoury tent
being dressed in his heavy armour Metal all over He sees Hal

FALSTAFF
This wind whips from the north
(smiles)
These are clouds sent from England

HAL
Why are you being fitted We were
to fight without plate

FALSTAFF
We need a front line to draw them
in

HAL

It can’t be you

FALSTAFF
The idea was mine Some man must
lead that first push to sell it
well

Falstaff fastens his armour

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
My men have been assembled Most
would rather wear the full suit It
gives comfort And I can’t in all
good conscience send them down
there to realise my speculative
drivel without getting muddy
alongside them

HAL
I will fight with you

FALSTAFF
(smiles)
Noble You know it can’t be

The armourer lifts Falstaff’s shoulder plate over his head

FALSTAFF (CONTD)

Hal

(corrects himself smiles)
My liege This is what I was built
for I die here or I die over a
bottle in Eastcheap I think this
makes for a better story And you
have things still to do

(beat)
You will join the fight Be sure
not to join it early Promise that
No matter what you see down there
We must first draw them all in All
of them

Falstaff rests his palm on Hal’s cheek

FALSTAFF (CONTD)
We win It will be an honour So
win my friend And maybe then
you’1l lighten enough to have a
drink with me

He grabs his helmet and waddles away Hal watches him lost

EXT ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - MORNING

Light rain continues to fall Hal strides between tents
distressed His horse is tethered attendants in wait He
checks and tightens its saddle The Archbishop appears beside
him An attendant holds an umbrella over the Archbishop

ARCHBISHOP
Your Majesty I have come to wish
you well I hope to offer a prayer
for the men before you set off

Hal ignores him mounts his horse and rides into the camp
Men watch him pass William among them as he makes for the
empty battlefield and then rides at speed alone across it
towards the French camp All are dumbfounded
EXT FRENCH CAMP AGINCOURT - MORNING
Commotion at the French camp at sight of Hal’s lone approach
Hal arrives and dismounts Frenchmen are armed and wary

HAL

(in French subtitled)
Where is the Dauphin

EXT DAUPHIN’S TENT AGINCOURT - MORNING
Hal on bended knee

HAL
(in French subtitled)
I humbly thank you for receiving
me noble lord

The Dauphin smug on his throne surrounded by his entourage

DAUPHIN
Speak English Please I enjoy to
speak English It is simple and
ugly

Hal stands trying to hide his contempt

DAUPHIN (CONTD)
I have been awaiting your surrender
all the morning All the night It
might have saved us all a great
unease had you offered it sooner

HAL
I know you speak not for your
father -

DAUPHIN
(haughtily)
I do speak for him

HAL
I know you do not speak for your
father and so I come now to you
directly I have not come to
surrender But too much Christian
blood will be spilled on this field
today and so I propose that you
and I fight one man on one man we
fight in our armies’ stead If I
lose my men will leave this place
forthwith and forever If I win I
will assume this kingdom’s crown
upon your father’s death I know he
is not long for this earth and so I
will let him see done his days in
peace But once he is gone France
will be mine

The Dauphin doesn’t respond then squirms and scoffs

HAL (CONT’D)
What say you

DAUPHIN
Are you afraid young Henry

HAL
What say you

DAUPHIN
Are you afraid of this battle
There is no shame of it

The Dauphin’s posturing is hollow Clearly he doesn’t want
to fight Hal Clearly his men would rather he did

HAL
Save your men

DAUPHIN
(anger rising)
Save your own men Surrender to me
You have come here To me

HAL
I can not do that

DAUPHIN
Well then boy let us make famous
that field out there Let us make
famous this little village of
Agincourt that will forever mark
the site of your callow disgrace

Hal stares him down He knows there is no deal to be done

EXT FRONT LINE ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - MORNING

The rain has intensified Hal rides slowly back from the
field and between rows of his ready men Falstaff’s smaller
armoured vanguard Archers Infantry All wait Thousands of
hardened nervous men All eerily silent

Hal surveys them He searches their eyes his distress
visible All is strangely quiet Then -

HAL
You expect of me a speech I have
only one to give - and it is the
same one I would were we not
standing here on the brim of a
battlefield It’s the same one I’d
give were we to meet by chance in
the street It is this I have only
ever hoped I have only ever longed
for one thing

(MORE )

HAL (CONTD)
To live to see our kingdom united
To see our kingdom united under
this English crown

He dismounts and walks among the men searching their faces
He is on the verge of tears The men watch him uncertain

HAL (CONTD)
All men are born to die We know
it We carry it with us always If
your day is today then so be it
Mine will be tomorrow Or mine
today and yours tomorrow It
matters not What matters is that
you know in your hearts that
today you are that kingdom united
You are England All of it Each
and every one of you England is
you And it is the space between
you Fight not for yourselves but
for that space

Hal takes an arm each of the two men nearest him and places
it on the other’s shoulder

HAL (CONTD)
Fight for that space Fill it Make
it tissue Make it mass

He urges others to place their arms on others’ shoulders The
gesture quickly spreads across the entire army

HAL (CONTD)
Make it impenetrable Make it
unassailable Make it yours

Hal’s emotions have spilled over He lets the men see his
vulnerability his raw wound They look back at him They
soak him in

HAL (CONTD)
Make it England

Beat And then loud -
HAL (CONTD)
Captains to it Lords and great men

all Each man to it

Falstaff smiles and puts on his helmet His men follow suit -
a formidable battalion of knights

The Dauphin watches almost smiling

EXT FRONT LINE ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - SAME

Falstaff crosses the line of his men He drags his sword over
their armour chest plates a version of his own speech

He lowers his face guard breathes and then - his band of
men begin their slow foot-march across the field

Hal stands with Westmorland They watch tense He moves away
towards the flanking forest

EXT BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Falstaff and his men march across the field Their line is
tight They move slow

EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Hal strides through the forest flank all the while watching
Falstaff’s advance He meets Dorset who waits with hundreds
of other men - a team of guerilla fighters on the edge of the
forest Maces and daggers and leather tunics at most
Everyone stripped down to bare minimum garb

The French still haven’t moved Tension rises

EXT BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Falstaff’s retinue continues its march The French mounted
line on the hill before them still hasn’t moved

EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Hal watches the field And then a horn blows and the first
French cavalry line begins its descent down the hill - but
it’s only one line moving slow

HAL
Archers

VOICE (0S)
Archers

The archers call is relayed through the forest to -

EXT FRONT LINE ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - SAME
- Westmorland who raises his hand

WESTMORLAND
Archers

Thousands of English archers step forward and load their
bows They raise them to sky - and then release in unison

EXT BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

A swarm of arrows rain down on the advancing French force
already slipping on the wet ground As the arrows hit with
deadly force chaos erupts - horses bash into each other the
French line splinters knights fall from their mounts and are
trampled

Those horses still advancing break into a gallop towards the
marching line of Falstaff’s men

Falstaff’s men hold tight and then as the mounted French
disarray is almost upon them they take to a knee pole-axes
and swords braced into the ground When the French line hits
these weapons are speared into the breasts and legs of horses
that fall and thrash French knights are thrown into the mud
and all hell breaks loose

The battlefield quickly turns into a seething mess of mud and
flailing knights and confused thrashing horses Men are
trampled and bashed

A knight fallen in the mud gets stuck face down and crawls
around helplessly He tries to lift himself A horse falls on
top of him pinning him to drown in the sodden earth

Falstaff is himself crawling on the ground wrestling with a
French knight He holds the knight’s helmet in the mud
suffocating him while himself being pummeled by men and
horses When the knight stops moving he tries desperately to
get back to his feet - near impossible with men and horses
right on top of him

He manages to grab onto a horse’s stirrup and lift himself
up only to find himself jammed between the rumps of two
terrified horses Desperate for breath Falstaff manages to

get his helmet off He lifts his face to the sky and sucks in
the air

EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Hal watches the carnage from the forest flank He wants to
fight but knows he can’t until the rest of the French force
is drawn in That force sits on top of the hill unmoving
EXT FRENCH CAMP AGINCOURT - SAME

The Dauphin watches from his position as the fight unfolds
below He signals to his commander

COMMANDER
Avance

The Dauphin dons his menacing elaborately decorated helmet

EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

Hal watches as a horn blows and the rest of the French force -
hundreds of armoured knights on foot - march down the hill
Hal turns to Dorset

HAL
They come
EXT ENGLISH CAMP AGINCOURT - SAME
Westmorland signals again

WESTMORLAND
Archers

The archers loaded and ready raise their bows to the sky
and release another barrage

EXT BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME

These arrows rain down on the second French line sending it
into its own chaos

The battlefield is now like a swirling mosh-pit Knights are
either on the ground being trampled or somehow still upright
but without room to lift their arms let alone to swing a
weapon in their heavy armour

EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - SAME
Hal is poised

HAL
Now Call it

DORSET
Men-at-arms

HAL
On me

A horn is blown And with that from all sides the stripped-
down English infantry run like crazy looters from the
forested flanks onto the field Hal leads the charge

As men are cut down around him he throws himself into the
fray confounding the French with speed and agility just as
Falstaff had pictured He slides and falls but is nimbly
back to his feet dodging and moving cutting and stabbing
Armoured French knights fall and flail Hal jams his dagger
into their throats as he is sucked into the swirling pit

Hal is dragged to the ground by a floundering French knight
He caves the knight’s helmet in with the hilt of his dagger
and then crawls beneath a horse’s belly to get back to his
feet

He manages to suck in air He looks to the sky as another
barrage of English arrows flies overhead

All slows down as he surveys the field - and we are lead into

a slow-motion sequence of shots of the terrified horses on
the battlefield The RAIN begins

OMITTED

EXT BATTLEFIELD AGINCOURT - LATER

As we return to real time again the rain is falling Hal is
somehow lying on the flank of a dying horse

He is dragged off and thrown into the mud While the ground
is carpeted with dead and dying the fighting is already
beginning to thin From the ground Hal can see Westmorland
being attacked by two French knights

As he’s about to be overcome Hal steps in and hacks one of
them down giving Westmorland the time and space to finish
the other

Hal is sucked back into the morass - until eerily it clears
Hal turns to see the Dauphin before him high on his horse
flanked by two equally menacingly armoured mounted guards

A space clears on the thinning field as the Dauphin
dismounts and approaches Hal

Hal picks up a discarded sword and readies himself

DAUPHIN
Come then King of England

Hal approaches him slowly and venomously

The Dauphin charges - and then immediately slips over in the
mud He flounders Tries to stand slips again

Hal watches him - as do all the other men on the field -
exhausted sucking in air battle-scarred

Hal looks to the Dauphin’s guards atop their horses

They offer no assistance They sit motionless atop their
horses looking down on their squirming leader

Hal steps back and nods to a group of his own men - who
charge at the Dauphin tackling him to the ground and tearing
into him with their daggers

Hal walks away as the sound of HORNS echoes across the field
and his tired army breaks into a victory roar

Hal forges a path through the mud and gore scouring the
ground searching faces of the dead and dying while riderless
horses roam the field too - as if on their own search

He searches more urgently until he stops over another corpse
He drops to his knees then sits in the mud beside the body
Falstaff - lifeless and serene
Hal sits with him and cries He looks out at the battlefield
watching the celebration of his men He then rests his head

on Falstaff’s back He sits this way a long moment

Finally Hal looks up He sees a mass of his fellow soldiers
spread across the field watching him Some two hundred men

Then - the closest soldier kneels Followed by a second
Hal is soon faced with an entire army kneeling before him

He stands and walks slowly across the field as more take up
the position

Westmorland approaches filthy exhausted He bows

WESTMORLAND
My liege

He stands and smiles They hug but Hal’s is without joy
WESTMORLAND (CONTD)
The prisoners we have took are a
rabble I fear we will not secure
them should their army regroup

Hal looks at him strangely distant

HAL
Kill them all

Hal walks away

EXT NANCY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

The English army marches in slow silent procession along a
trail towards the town of Nancy

Hal on horseback leads the procession William and Dorset
beside him The Archbishop is there too smugly proud

A thin crowd of peasant villagers lines the trail The
atmosphere is strange cold and muted The people have come
out to see the invaders their conquerors

EXT MAYORAL BUILDINGS NANCY - DAY

In the courtyard of impressive civic buildings Hal
dismounts French officials are there to greet him

The FRENCH LORD STEWARD genuflects The air is tense

FRENCH LORD STEWARD
(in French subtitled)
Your Highness His Majesty King
Charles is here to meet you
(beat)
He is sunning himself

EXT PORCH MAYORAL BUILDINGS NANCY - DAY
Hal is lead onto a colonnaded stone porch

FRENCH LORD STEWARD
(in French subtitled)
Your Majesty King Henry the Fifth
of England

Across the porch an old man in regal attire sits ina
reclined chair He is barefoot He speaks English

KING CHARLES VI
Your Highness Welcome Please
come sit here with me

Hal crosses the porch Charles gestures for him to sit

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
Please

Hal sits William the Archbishop and others remain standing

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
I like to have the sun on my skin
But not too much Too much is very
dangerous So I take only a small
amount

Among Charles’s entourage seated discreetly in the setting
is a young woman 20 - the only woman in the room

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
And here I meet the man about whom
I have heard such a great deal
Much of it apocryphal no doubt
Rumour and gossip

(MORE )

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
And yet when finally you are here
before me this apocrypha becomes
air Or memory Nothing

He searches Hal’s eyes Hal seems calm and quietly contained

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
I can only imagine the stories that
have been told about me And about
my own son No doubt you have heard
many I suspect they may be the
reason we are here today My son
was impetuous And what he felt he
felt keenly - for better or for
worse Very often for worse And
the best defence I can summon now
is that he was young Maybe it is a
poor defence But I hope it is one
with which you might feel some
affinity I hope also that you
might understand my need to grieve
his death as all fathers must
grieve their lost sons - whatever
their failings

HAL
I do understand

KING CHARLES VI
Thank you

Charles pauses thinking

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
This conversation we have - or are
about to have - has been had many
times before and will be had many
times again for centuries to come
between men from all corners
between men of vanity and men of
good reason in whatever
combination I would like to
believe that you and I are men of
good reason Men of vanity would
have this trouble continue until
the brink of our mutual
devastation Maybe beyond

Charles looks around at Hal’s entourage gently assaying these
men for the first time

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
I have of course travelled here
to offer you my surrender

The Archbishop smiles proudly

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
Maybe it is our shared destiny that
our lands be ruled as one We have
shared histories - shared
apocrypha Might it be that this is
the path we have travelled to make
our unity so

Hal looks at the old man His equanimity is humbling

HAL
Do you ask anything of me in
return

KING CHARLES VI
No

Charles searches Hal’s eyes then shifts his gaze to the
woman sitting nearby She lowers her eyes

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
I do however have for you a
proposition - that as a gesture of
harmony and goodwill you take the
hand of my daughter Catherine in
marriage

Hal looks to PRINCESS CATHERINE who looks back at him
defiant

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
My son caused me much pain And by
extension he caused more pain to
both of us than I care to examine
But my daughter She would follow
me to the far corners without
dispute I would hope that a bond
between you between us might
prevent these troubles from
recurring

Charles looks to Catherine Hal looks to her also

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
It is most uncanny and yet not so
at all that the great movements of
history so frequently find their
origins in the minutia of family
(MORE )
EXT SHIP

KING CHARLES VI (CONT’D)
That in ways I dare not unsettle
here I must only assume that my
relationship with my son and yours
with your father - these are the
things that have led us here today
We are leaders of lands and of
peoples and yet it is family that
moves us Family consumes us

- DAY

Hal sits alone at the ship’s bow He looks out to sea at his
fleet returning home The weather is clear and calm All is

strangely

quiet William approaches

WILLIAM
My liege

He takes a seat beside Hal

Hal nods

WILLIAM (CONTD)
How do you feel

HAL
Tired

WILLIAM
My condolences to you for the loss
of Sir John I know you must feel
this loss deeply

HAL
Thank you William Your loyalty to
me has been comforting

WILLIAM
It is my honour and duty my liege

HAL
It would seem comfort is a valuable
commodity to a man in my position

WILLIAM
You have proved yourself a most
worthy king I should say that
already you have proven yourself to
be one of England’s great kings

A tired smile He looks out to sea

warrior and king

He is a victorious

INT KING’S BEDCHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal is dressed in finery He stands alone at the window
listening to a huge crowd outside

The Lord Chamberlain enters

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
My liege A crowd has gathered

HAL
So I see

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Shall I escort you to the east
wing

HAL
No I will be ready shortly

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
As you wish Your Majesty

The Lord Chamberlain exits Hal stands thinking a moment
longer He seems calm He turns and heads for the door
INT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal walks the hall Aides bow as he passes unexpectedly

INT BEDCHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Princess Catherine is attended by ladies-in-waiting There is
a KNOCK at the door

LADY-IN-WAITING
Enter

Hal enters He closes the door behind him and bows
CATHERINE
(to her aides)
Veuillez nous laisser
The aides file out of the room Catherine is seated
CATHERINE (CONTD)
(in French subtitled)

Please sit Your Majesty

Hal approaches hesitantly and sits opposite Catherine
Beat

HAL
(in French subtitled)
You are beautiful

CATHERINE
Merci

HAL
(in French subtitled)
I will no longer speak French We
must speak English

CATHERINE
(in French subtitled)
I cannot speak English

HAL
(in French subtitled)
You will learn

CATHERINE
(in French subtitled)
I wonder then how our union might
proceed in the meantime

HAL
There is much I wonder about a
great many things

CATHERINE
(in English)
Indeed there must be for you to
contemplate marriage to a woman
about whom you know so little

Hal is caught off guard She watches him a moment

CATHERINE (CONTD)
I will not submit to you You must
earn my respect I am not my
father My father is old and tired
and he no longer has the will to
fight But I am young and I have
that will in abundance This is the
woman you have chosen to take as
your wife

Hal looks at her still befuddled

HAL
I understand that

CATHERINE
Do you

HAL
I do

CATHERINE

Do you feel a sense of achievement

HAL
In what regard

CATHERINE
In any regard

Hal looks at her He wasn’t expecting to be challenged

HAL
I have achieved that which my
father never could I have united
this kingdom in common cause

CATHERINE
You have achieved momentary
respite A unity forged under false
pretense will never be a unity that
prevails

Hal is taken aback but engaged by Catherine

HAL
How pray have my endeavours been
forged falsely

CATHERINE
Why did you bring war to France

HAL
Your father came on spoiling

CATHERINE
How so How was he spoiling

HAL
He sent an assassin

CATHERINE
There was no assassin There was no
plot to kill you

HAL
And how might you be sure

CATHERINE
Because I was with my father when
he received word of your charge I
know him well enough to know his
reaction to be genuine

HAL
How was his reaction

CATHERINE
He laughed He laughed very much
He said you must be drunk

HAL
Your father is a madman

CATHERINE
He may be mad but he is true His
madness makes him true He says
only what he believes That is why
he is loved

Hal’s demeanour starts to shift darken

HAL
The assassin then was sent by your
brother

CATHERINE

My brother My brother was too
stupid to conjure such a plan For
all of his failings he was not one
to send a killer in his stead He
preferred to do his killing
himself What was your true reason

HAL
Did you know of the ball he sent
The ball that he sent to me

CATHERINE
He sent to you a ball

Beat She lets this hang Hal shifts uncomfortably
CATHERINE (CONTD)

He sent to you a ball Is that
why you have -

HAL
Why should you question my intent
Your father’s rule is illegitimate
He has no right claim to his -

CATHERINE
All monarchy is illegitimate You
yourself are the son of a usurper

Hal sits thinking darkening

CATHERINE (CONTD)
It would seem that you have no
explanation for what you have done
You have shed the blood of so many
Christian souls and yet before me
now I see only a young and vain and
foolish man so easily riled and so
easily beguiled

Hal is staring at her now His thoughts are splintering
CATHERINE (CONTD)
Have you contemplated this Have
you contemplated the ambitions of
the men around you
Still no response from Hal
Hal and Catherine stare at each other She isn’t sure how Hal
will react - she expects opprobrium She knows she has spoken

provocatively Instead Hal responds with unsettling calm

HAL
I must leave you now

He stands and bows She nods cautiously Hal exits

INT ANTECHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal walks the hall briskly his head swimming More nervous
genuflection from aides caught off guard by his passing

He rounds a corner down a hall his eyes fixed and cold He
reaches a door He opens it without pausing or knocking
INT WILLIAMS CHAMBER ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal enters William is standing on a little stool having his
gaudy ceremonial robes lint-brushed by a pageboy

WILLIAM
(sprightly)
My liege

Hal closes the door behind him He sits in a chair by the
door and watches William who looks at himself in a mirror

WILLIAM (CONTD)
You must be sure to revel in this
day A crowd gathered to honour
victory These are the rare moments
for which a king lives

Beat Hal tries to still his swirling thoughts

HAL
In all my preoccupation I have
neglected to ask after your family

WILLIAM
Your preoccupations are hardly
trifling my liege

HAL
You have two sons
WILLIAM
I do
HAL

And your wife minds your estate in
your absence

WILLIAM
She does Yes

HAL
Yours is sheep You’re a man of wool

WILLIAM
I am As my father was before me

HAL
How many head

WILLIAM
Some four thousand at last count
Mostly Dorset horns

HAL
How much land have you

WILLIAM
To be true I’m not wholly certain
Many hundreds of beautiful acres

HAL
What lands in France have you now
annexed

A pause William looking at himself in the mirror

WILLIAM
I’m not sure I understand my
liege

HAL

Now that France is ours how much
of her land is now yours

WILLIAM
My liege

HAL
Her farming land her sheep grazing
land How much of it is now yours

William is troubled by the course Hal’s enquiry has taken
WILLIAM
This has yet to be determined Our
conquest is so recent Why do you
ask my liege
Hal watches William contempt brewing

WILLIAM (CONTD)
My liege

William moves to step down off his little stool

HAL
Don’t move Stay up there

Hal stares at him William steps back onto his little stool

The pageboy can clearly sense the tension He sits back on
the floor and tries to make himself invisible

HAL (CONTD)
How did my assassin come to you

WILLIAM
(flustered)
I am afraid I do not understand
your meaning

HAL
My question is simple You brought
the assassin to my attention Under
what circumstances did he come to
yours

WILLIAM
I I fail to remember at this
moment

HAL
Remedy this failure

WILLIAM
I ah let me recall So much has
happened in the intervening months

HAL
An event so pivotal should be amply
equipped to penetrate the fog of
time elapsed

WILLIAM
Yes of course Let me recall

HAL
Was it in the street Did he come
to you in the street

WILLIAM
Yes Yes he did He approached me
in the street most unusually My
liege please tell me the cause of
this concern

William moves again to step off his little stool

HAL
Stay up there

William shuffles awkwardly back on to the stool

HAL (CONT’D)
He came to you in the street Did
he know your name

WILLIAM
I ah I do not believe he did

HAL
How then did he know who you were
to approach

WILLIAM
I ah I’m not certain
Perchance But no give me pause

- the memory is returning Of
course He surrendered himself to a
palace guard and the matter was
brought to my attention and I was
then taken to him in his cell

HAL
So he did not meet you in the
street

WILLIAM

No It was not in the street
Forgive me I was summoned to the
cells to interrogate the wretch He
had already surrendered himself

Hal stares at him William squirms
WILLIAM (CONTD)

My liege please Has a problem
arisen

HAL
Yes A problem has arisen And it
wobbles before me now on its silly
little stool at mine own elevation

WILLIAM
My liege I don’t understand

HAL
Stop this charade now

WILLIAM
Sincerely I don’t -

HAL
(yelling
STOP THIS FUCKING CHARADE

WILLIAM
(explodes )
I have given you what you wanted
boy Have I not

William and Hal breathe shocked at their own respective
outbursts Everything has changed

William steps off his stool and goes the window
WILLIAM (CONTD)
You wanted peace This is how peace
is forged It is forged in victory

The crowd noise outside swells William points to the window

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Listen Do you hear it

He and Hal listen to the crowd

WILLIAM (CONTD)
That is the sound of peace

Hal watches him then drops his head William steps gently
toward him

WILLIAM (CONTD)
That is the sound of peace

Hal looks up defeated lonely William extends his arms

WILLIAM (CONTD)
That is the sound of your
greatness

William takes Hal’s head gently in his hands Hal lets
himself be mollified William smiles

William lowers himself and genuflects He bows with reverence
and rests his forehead on Hal’s knee

Hal lets it sit there a moment and then - he takes the ends
of the scarf draped across William’s shoulders and pulls them
tight around William’s throat

William struggles immediately He writhes and kicks as Hal
chokes him

Hal’s grip is deathly strong His eyes glaze with venom As
William thrashes Hal stares coldly ahead at the pageboy
kneeling motionless and staring at the floor

William takes a long time to die Eventually his writhing
slows And then stops

Hal drops him like a sack to the floor

Hal breathes He stands and exits

OMITTED

INT OFFICE ROYAL COURT - DAY

Hal enters the office which is now full of courtiers - among
them Dorset and Westmorland The crowd outside is loud

As Hal enters all present bow He stands and surveys the
room He surveys the people in it genuflecting before him

Catherine is there He goes to her She watches his approach
She can see that something has shifted in him

Hal holds his hand out to her She takes it cautiously
HAL
(quiet only for her)
I ask nothing of you other than
that you will always speak to me
clear and true Always Will you
promise me only that
She looks at him gently searching his face

CATHERINE
I will

He leads her to the balcony

As they step out into the blinding light the crowd roars

THE END
