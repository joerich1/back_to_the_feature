In the passenger seat 14-year-old EMMETT TILL is playfully
lip syncing too

EMMETT
(lip syncing)
Oh Lord won’t you tell me why I

The two are having a ball
Soon Emmett performs solo while Mamie laughs and continues
to drive As she glances at her son full of so much joy her

face quietly falls with serious contemplation

INT MARSHALL FIELDS DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 3
Mamie confidently walks past aisles of mostly white affluent
CUSTOMERS She has a shoe box under her arm and heads towards
Emmett looking at wallets several yards away

A white male SECURITY GUARD intercepts Mamie’s path

SECURITY GUARD
Are you looking for something

MAMIE
(surprised)
No
Mamie senses he is not trying to be helpful She glances at
the sea of white Customers who will not face the same
interrogation

MAMIE (CONTD)
I’m just doing a little shopping

He looks down at Mamie’s box of shoes

SECURITY GUARD
We also have shoes in the basement

Mamie’s jaw tightens

MAMIE
Do your other customers know that
too --

EMMETT

(calls out)
Mama Which one do you like b-b-
better
He often stutters on his Bs and Ps

Mamie gives the Security Guard a final look and speaks with
masked contempt

MAMTE
Pardon me

She walks to Emmett with her head held high
Emmett holds out a wallet to Mamie

EMMETT
I think I like this one
Pink Rev 3

She flips it open to reveal a STOCK PHOTOGRAPH of the white
movie star HEDY LAMARR Mamie notices the Security Guard
scowling at them from afar She subtly obstructs Emmett’s
line of sight so he wouldn’t notice the policing

MAMIE
Will you really need a wallet while
you’re down there

EMMETT
Pleeeeease

Emmett pleads with a goofy adorable smile Mamie knows she’s
wrapped around his finger

EXT MAMIE’S HOUSE - DUSK 4

Emmett bows to applause by his audience on the couch ALMA
(50s) and GENE (30s) who has his arm wrapped around Mamie

ALMA
And you didn’t stutter not one
time

Emmett jumps on the couch next to Mamie and stuffs a handful
of popcorn from the bowl into his mouth

What’s wrong

Mamie doesn’t answer at first but then says what’s been
her mind

MAMIE
Weve never been apart this long

ALMA
He wants to see his cousins And
there’s nothing wrong with him
knowing where he comes from --

MAMIE

Emmett looks at his reflection in the mirror with approval
and continues singing

dance

EMMETT

“He thought he was the cream of the

Emmett’s shirt collar She then turns serious

MAMIE

talking about They have a
different set of rules for Negroes

around white people You can’t risk
looking at them the wrong way --

Emmett becomes stilted like Buster Keaton and shuffles
around Mamie shakes her head and giggles half-heartedly

INT MAMIE’S BEDROOM - DAY 10
Mamie removes a yellowed envelope from a jewelry box

She explores the details of the envelope -- US ARMY SEAL AND
ITEM NUMBER -- then dumps the contents into her palm a
SILVER RING with the inscription “MAY 25 1943 LT” Her
expression shows deep reminisce

She turns around to Emmett

MAMIE
Instead of your father’s ring how
about you wear the cufflinks I got
you for Christmas They’1l look so
handsome on you

EMMETT
No Mama I wanna wear the ring

He looks at her with pleading eyes She gives in and
carefully hands the ring to Emmett

Mr Huff and none of them seem to
have anything to do with my son

Huff takes a beat

HUFF
I’ve been briefed about your case --

MAMIE
Bo’s not a case

Huff takes another beat and tries again

HUFF
I drafted two telegrams to send to
Governor White in Mississippi and
Governor Stratton here in
Illinois It’s important they know
about Emmett

He pulls out two pieces of paper from a folder

HUFF (CONTD)
In light of what happened to
Reverend Lee and Mr Smith the
Negro press in Mississippi is
starting to write about Emmett’s
kidnapping but it’s not creating
enough pressure needed to force a
state-wide search As your counsel
Id want to utilize all the press
here in Chicago it’1l be more
likely to get picked up in other
cities that way You would have to
talk to the reporters and speak in
front of cameras So we like to
make sure that the person who is
telling the story will be in public
favor

they were killed right before Bo
got down there

holds out the pamphlet about the citizen’s council

MAMIE
I know these citizens’ councils are
everywhere down there You think
they had a part in any of it

Huff doesn’t want to answer but must

HUFF
When your message to white people
is to stop Negroes from voting or
advancing by any means short of
violence it’s only a matter of
time before someone doesn’t stop
short of it

GENE
Let’s just focus on finding Bo

Gene picks up the telegrams and signals for Mamie to read
them with him

As she and Gene look through the telegrams Huff’s face
softens

HUFF
Why do you call him Bo

Mamie looks up and takes a beat

MAMIE
When I was carrying him my Mama’s
friend would bring him gifts all

could identify the body you saw
there at the funeral home as that
of your son Emmett Till

MAMTE
I could

Mamie takes her time speaking to the whole room

MAMIE (CONTD)
It’s hard to describe what a mother
knows

SMITH
Please

MAMIE
The first thing I noticed when I
became a mother was that my hands
were busy all the time Rocking
carrying swaying Always full one
hand for him and one hand for what
he needed When time came to place
him down so he could make his own
way around I’d touched every inch
of him every bend My hands knew
him with my eyes closed Just like
I would know his laughter ina
crowded room It’s the same thing
when you know all of someone

Mamie breathes in strength then closes her eyes She reaches
out her hands gripping the memory

MAMIE (CONTD)

I started by laying my hands on a
foot then I found his knees I
remembered him as my fingers traced
his hair line and bumped over the
crease of his eye lids He was
spoiled and puffed but these were
the same parts of a boy I nurtured
and loved Nothing and no one could
hide him from me

You have been quoted in the colored
press “I told him several times
before he left Mississippi that he
should kneel in the street and beg
for forgiveness should he insult a
white person”

Mamie’s jaw clenches

MAMTE
Not those exact words

BRELAND
Did you caution him not to insult
white women

MAMIE
I referred to white people in
general

BRELAND
Did you caution your son how to
conduct himself and behave himself
while he was down here in
Mississippi

Mamie’s eyes narrow

Mamie looks at John and Medgar confused by the question
Pink Rev MAMTE
Several times

BRELAND
Several times Do tell us how

MAMIE

I will give you a literal
description of what I told him
How coming down here he would have
to adapt himself to a different way
of life

(caustic)
Be very careful about how he spoke
and to whom he spoke and to always
remember to say “Yes Sir” and “No
Ma’am” I told him that if ever an
incident should arise where there
would be any trouble of any kind
with white people that if it got
to the point where he even had to
go down on his knees before them
well I told him not to hesitate to
do so

(angry)
Like if he bumped into somebody on
the street and then they might get
belligerent or something Well I
told him to go ahead and humble
himself so as not to get into any
trouble But you know

BRELAND
No I don’t Please continue
Mamie

MAMTE

(almost holds back but)
Well I raised him with love for
fourteen years My sudden warnings
about hate weren’t going to get
through

Breland looks pleased by Mamie losing control of her
emotions

has shown me that what happens to
any of us anywhere in the world
had better be the business of us

CUT TO

INT MAMIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 152
She --
Unpacks her suitcase

Removes her high heels and jewelry (including Emmett’s
watch)

Wraps her hair in a headscarf and lays down on her bed

She sits in silence for a beat and then turns to her record
player

She gets up to play a DIZZY GILLESPIE record and takes in the
music with reminisce

Pink Rev 105

She then has a thought

INT EMMETT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 153
With the music filling the house Mamie enters Emmett’s room
and turns on the light The room has been completely
untouched

Mamie takes a few steps inside and looks around at the very
place she and Emmett had danced the day he left for
Mississippi

And then she stares ahead

WE ENTER MAMIE’S IMAGINATION

The CAMERA PANS AROUND to reveal Emmett standing by the
doorway dressed in vacation clothes and the hat he wore to
Mississippi He is all smiles

Mamie turns to Emmett and smiles back

CUT TO

THE FOLLOWING IS A CACOPHONY OF SHOTS THAT BLUR TOGETHER
LIKE A DREAM

vacation attire Emmett is playing around in the backseat
Mamie and Gene are laughing hysterically

EXT BEACH - DAY 155
Mamie jumps into the water with Emmett and Gene Mamie and
Emmett’s faces are full of joy as they float in the perfectly
blue water

INT CHURCH - DAY 156
It’s Mamie’s wedding day John and Emmett walk her down the
aisle to Gene She passes Alma Ollie and Willie Mae on her
way to the altar Emmett looks up at her with a smile Mamie
smiles back

She and Gene kiss

Pink Rev 106

INT RECEPTION HALL - DAY 157

Mamie her family and friends all dance together having a
ball

Mamie takes Emmett’s hand and the two of them dance together

As they dance the crowd fades and the world becomes just the

two of them

They laugh and dance and twirl

They look into each other’s eyes filled with so much joy
Until Mamie’s face begins to fall

Emmett slowly lets go of Mamie’s hand

And reality sets in

The music stops

FADE OUT

OMIT 158
