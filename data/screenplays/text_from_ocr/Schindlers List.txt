As a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a
registration card there is absolute silence then

the Hungarian love song Gloomy Sunday distant
stripe bleeds into COLOR into BRIGHT YELLOW INK

INT HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW POLAND - NIGHT

The song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink
The light in the room is dismal the furniture cheap
curtains are faded the wallpaper peeling but the
laid out across the single bed are beautiful

The hands of a man button the shirt belt the slacks
slips into the double-breasted jacket knots the silk
folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket

all with great deliberation

A bureau Some currency cigarettes liquor passport
an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or
which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant
jacket

He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror
likes what he sees Oskar Schindler -- salesman from
looking almost reputable in his one nice suit

Even in this awful room

INT NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW POLAND - NIGHT

A spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club
small stage where a cabaret performer sings

It’s September 1939 General Sigmund Lists armored
divisions driving north from the Sudetenland have
officers and

Cracow and now in this club
conducting business

drinking socializing
is a strange clientele SS
Polish cops gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs
together by the circumstance of war

Oskar Schindler

drinking alone slowly scans the room

faces stripping away all that’s unimportant to him
only on details that are the rank of this man the
rank of that one money being slipped into a hand
WAITER SETS DOWN DRINKS

in front of the SS officer who took the money A

he’s at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking
officer

WAITER
From the gentleman
The waiter is gesturing to a table across the room
Schindler seemingly unaware of the SS men drinks with
best-looking woman in the place

LIEUTENANT
Do I know him

His sergeant doesn’t His girlfriend doesnt

LIEUTENANT
Find out who he is

The sergeant makes his way over to Schindlers table

Theres a handshake and introductions before -- and the
lieutenant watching cant believe it -- his guy

the chair Schindlers dragging over
The lieutenant waits but his man doesnt come back
forgotten already he went there for a reason Finally

it irritates the SS man he has to get up and go over
table

him for

SS

LIEUTENANT
Stay here

His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindlers

Before he even arrives Schindler is up and berating
leaving his date way over there across the room waving
the girl to come join them motioning to waiter to

some tables together

WAITERS ARRIVE WITH PLATES OF CAVIAR

and another round of drinks The lieutenant makes a
halfhearted move for his wallet

LIEUTENANT
Let me get this one

SCHINDLER
No put it away put it away

Schindlers already got his money out Even as hes

his eyes are working the room settling on a table

girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking
men

A TABLECLOTH BILLOWS

as a waiter lays it down on another table thats been
to the others Schindler seats the SS officers on

side of his own date --

SCHINDLER
What are you drinking gin

He motions to a waiter to refill the mens drinks and
returning to the head of the table(s) sweeps the room

with his eyes

a better time than those people over there His guests
swelled to ten or twelve -- SS men Polish cops girls
and he moves among them like the great entertainer he
making sure everybodys got enough to eat and drink
Here closer at this table across the room an SS
gestures to one of the SS men who an hour ago couldnt
the girl to sit at his table The guy comes over

SS OFFICER 1
Who is that

SS OFFICER 2
(like everyone knows)

Thats Oskar Schindler Hes an old

friend of I dont know somebodys
GIRL WITH A BIG CAMERA

As the bulb flashes the noise of the club suddenly

EXT SQUARE - CRACOW - DAY
A photograph of a face on a work card BLACK and WHITE

Stern
Behind Schindler the door to another apartment closes
A radio somewhere is suddenly silenced

SCHINDLER
Are you Itzhak Stern

At the door of this apartment a man with the face and
of a Talmudic scholar finally nods in resignation
number has just come up

STERN
I am

Schindler offers a hand Confused Stern tentatively
for it and finds his own grasped firmly
INT STERNS APARTMENT - DAY
Settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple
Schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask
SCHINDLER
Theres a company you did the books

for on Lipowa Street made what
pots and pans

Stern stares at the cognac Schindlers offering him He
doesnt know who this man is or what he wants

STERN
(pause)
By law I have to tell you sir Im
a Jew

Schindler looks puzzled then shrugs dismissing it

SCHINDLER
All right youve done it -- good
company you think

He keeps holding out the drink Stern declines it with
slow shake of his head

STERN
It did all right

Schindler nods takes out a cigarette case

SCHINDLER
I dont know anything about
enamelware do you

He offers Stern a cigarette Stern declines again

STERN
I was just the accountant

SCHINDLER
Simple engineering though wouldnt
you think Change the machines around
whatever you do you could make other
things couldnt you

Schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly
be
someone else listening in somewhere

SCHINDLER
Field kits mess kits

He waits for a reaction and misinterprets Sterns
silence
for a lack of understanding

SCHINDLER
Army contracts

But Stern does understand He understands too well
Schindler grins good-naturedly

SCHINDLER
Once the war ends forget it but
for now its great you could make a
fortune Dont you think

STERN
(with an edge)
simple

Stern

abruptly

aside -

another

I think most people right now have
other priorities

Schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could
possibly be He cant

SCHINDLER
Like what

Stern smiles despite himself The mans manner is so

so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being
Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939 He really doesnt know
decides to end the conversation

STERN
Get the contracts and Im sure youll
do very well In fact the worse things
get the better youll do It was a
pleasure

SCHINDLER

The contracts Thats the easy part
Finding the money to buy the company
thats hard

He laughs loudly uproariously But then just as

as the laugh erupted hes dead serious all kidding

SCHINDLER
You know anybody

Stern stares at him curiously sitting there taking
sip of his cognac placid as a large dog

SCHINDLER
Jews yeah Investors

STERN
(pause)
Jews can no longer own businesses
sir thats why this ones for sale

SCHINDLER
Well they wouldnt own it Id own
it Id pay them back in product
They can trade it on the black market
do whatever they want everybodys
happy

He shrugs it sounds more than fair to him But not to

Stern
STERN
Pots and pans
SCHINDLER
(nodding)
Something they can hold in their
hands
Stern studies him This man is nothing more than a
salesman
with a salesmans pitch just dressed better than most
STERN
I dont know anybody whod be
interested in that
SCHINDLER

They should be

and

The young Polish Jew from the street Poldek

kneels crosses himself and slides in next to another
man Goldberg going over notes scribbled on a little
inside a missal Pfefferberg shows him a container of
polish he takes from his pocket Whispered bored --

GOLDBERG
Whats that

PFEFFERBERG
You dont recognize it Maybe thats
because its not what I asked for

GOLDBERG
You asked for shoe polish

PFEFFERBERG
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold
it to the Army But by the time it
got there -- because of the cold --
it broke the whole truckload

GOLDBERG
(pause)
So Im responsible for the weather

PFEFFERBERG
I asked for metal you gave me glass

GOLDBERG
This is not my problem

PFEFFERBERG
Look it up

Goldberg doesnt bother he pockets his little notepad
intones a response to the priests prayer all but
Pfefferberg
PFEFFERBERG
This is not your problem Everybody
wants to know who I got it from and

Im going to tell them

Goldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time
and

notepad of his own --
PFEFFERBERG

Lets say this is what you give me

These are fees I have to pay some

guys This is my commission This is

what I bring you back in Occupation

The clerk satisfied with the figures is about to hand
to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an
when Schindler comes in from the street The clerk puts
money away gets Schindler his room key waits for him

leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg

Schindler doesnt leave he just keeps looking over at
Pfefferbergs shirt at the cuffs the collar

PFEFFERBERG
Thats a nice shirt

Pfefferberg nods Yeah thanks and waits for Schindler
leave but he doesnt Nor does he appear to hear the
burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up

street
SCHINDLER
You dont know where I could find a
shirt like that

Pfefferberg knows he should say no let that be the

end of
it Its not wise doing business with a German who
could
have you arrested for no reason whatsoever But theres
something guileless about it
PFEFFERBERG
Like this
SCHINDLER
(nodding)
Theres nothing in the stores
The clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing
this
transaction with just a look Pfefferberg ignores it
PFEFFERBERG
You have any idea what a shirt like
this costs
SCHINDLER
Nice things cost money
The clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look
that
this isnt smart
PFEFFERBERG
How many
SCHINDLER
I dont know ten or twelve Thats
a good color Dark blues grays
Schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off
bills
waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when its enough Hes
being
overcharged and he knows it but Pfefferberg keeps
pushing
it more The look Schindler gives him lets him know
that
hes trying to hustle a hustler but that in this
instance

at least hell let it go He hands over the money and

EXT GARDEN - SCHERNERS RESIDENCE - CRACOW - DAY
As Oberfuhrer Scherner and his daughter in a wedding
dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand the

guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive

CZURDA
The SS doesnt own the trains
somebodys got to pay Whether its
a passenger car or a livestock car
it doesnt matter -- which by the
way you have to see You have to
set aside an afternoon go down to
the station and see this

Other SS and Army officers share the table with Czurda
Schindler too nice blue shirt jacket only he

seem to be paying attention rather his attention and
affections are directed to the blonde next to him

CZURDA
So you got thousands of fares that
have to be paid Since its the SS
thats reserved the trains logically
they should pay But this is a lot
of money
(pause)
The Jews Theyre the ones riding
the trains they should pay So you
got Jews paying their own fares to
ride on cattle cars to God knows
where They pay the SS full fare
the SS turns around pays the railroad
a reduced excursion fare and pockets

Schindler gets up from the table Scherner his wife

daughter and son-in-law stare at the horses theyre
beautiful

Schindler appears takes the reins from the stable boy
one set to the bride and the other to the groom
SCHINDLER
Theres nothing more sacred than
marriage No happier an occasion

his camera so does just about everybody else Scherner
insists Schindler pose with the astonished bride and

One by one then they file past and spit on the scroll
The

exchange
a glance The rabbi finally does it the gangster

After a long tense silence

MAX REDLICHT
I havent been to temple must be

Schindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his
wife
Behind him through a doorway Klonowska can be seen
hurriedly

SCHINDLER
You know what youd like her
EMILIE
Oskar please --
SCHINDLER
What --
EMILIE
I dont have to like her just because
you do It doesnt work that way
SCHINDLER
You would though Thats what Im
saying
His face is complete innocence Its the first thing
she

fell in love with and perhaps the thing that keeps her
from
killing him now Klonowska emerges from the bedroom

thoroughly
self-conscious
KLONOWSKA
Goodbye It was a pleasure meeting
you
She shakes Emilies limp hand Schindler sees her to
the
door lets her out and returns to the table smiling to

A charade How could it be a charade

She doesnt know but she does know him And all these
signs

of apparent success just dont fit his profile
Schindler

lets her in on a discovery

SCHINDLER
Theres no way I could have known
this before but there was always
something missing In every business
I tried I see now it wasnt me that
was failing it was this thing this

An old man with one arm appears in the doorway and
Schindler
glances to the ceiling to heaven As the man slowly
makes
his way into the room Schindler sees the bruises on
his
face And when he speaks only half his mouth moves
the
other half is paralyzed
LOWENSTEIN
I want to thank you sir for giving

worker I expect to be compensated
TOFFEL
File a grievance with the Economic
Office its your right
SCHINDLER
Would it do any good
TOFFEL
No
Schindler knows its not Toffels fault but the whole
situation is maddening to him He shakes his head in
disgust

TOFFEL
I think youre going to have to put
up with a lot of snow shoveling yet

Unlike your radiators -- and your
boxes -- my products arent for sale
on the open market This company has
only one client the German Army
And lately Ive been having trouble
fulfilling my obligations to my
client With your help I hope the
problem can be solved The problem
simply is space

gentlemen

each a set of documents
SCHINDLER
Id like you to consider a proposal
which I think youll find equitable
Id like you to think about it and
get back to me as soon as --

KUHNPAST
Excuse me -- do you really think

this is appropriate

The man glances to Stern and back to Schindler his

look
saying This is wrong having a Jew present while we
discuss

admit
it Kuhnpast almost sighs
KUHNPAST
I can appreciate your problem If I
had any space I could lease you I

a cigarette Schindler tamps it against the crystal of
his
gold watch
GESTAPO CLERK
This standard of living comes entirely
from legitimate sources I take it
Schindler lights the cigarette and drags on it all but
ignoring the man
GESTAPO CLERK
As an SS supplier you have a moral
obligation to desist from blackmarket
dealings Youre in business to
support the war effort not to fatten --
SCHINDLER

You know When my friends ask Id
love to be able to tell them you

Recovering he tells Klonowska to stay in the car and
along the side of the train calls Sterns name to the
peering out from behind the slats and barbed wire

Goeth surveys the site from a knoll clearly pleased

But then hes distracted by voices -- a mans a
arguing down where some barracks are being erected
The woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave
hand and stalks back to a half-finished barracks The
one from the car Hujar sees Goeth Knude and Haase
down the hill and moves to meet them

She says the foundation was poured

wrong shes got to take it down I

(calmly)
Shoot her

Its hard to tell which is more stunned by the order
woman or Hujar Both stare at Goeth in disbelief He
her the reason along with a shrug --
GOETH
You argued with my man

Shoot her

Hujar unholsters his pistol but holds it limply at his

The workers become aware of whats happening and still
hammers

Goeth groans and takes the gun from him and puts it to

Although hes never been here the industrialist comes

He works his way around the table patting Bosch and
on the back -- he knows them -- shaking Hujars hand

to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to
SCHINDLER

Goeth watches him The others watch Goeth

SCHINDLER

HUJAR
I was explaining to Mr Bosch and
Mr Madritsch some of the benefits
of moving their factories into

SCHINDLER
Oh good yeah

Schindler clearly doesnt care but nods as though he
did

He drinks Goeth just watches him with what seems to be
growing amusement He nods to Hujar to continue

HUJAR
Since your labor is housed on-site
its available to you at all times
You can work them all night if you
want Your factory policies whatever
theyve been in the past theyll
continue to be theyll be respected --

Schindler laughs out loud cutting Hujar off Hujar
glances
over to Goeth nonplussed

food
thats set down in front of him

Goeth pours glasses of cognac

GOETH
Something wonderfuls happened do

Schindler nods pensively perhaps in agreement perhaps
at

some other thought Theres a silence broken finally
by --

SCHINDLER
I go to work the other day theres
nobody there Nobody tells me about
this I have to find out I have to
go in everybodys gone --

GOETH
Theyre not gone theyre here

SCHINDLER

His voice echoes into silence An acquiescent shrug
from
Goeth finally And a nod Schindlers right

SCHINDLER

(pause)
Occasionally sure okay you got to
make an example But thats good

Schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle

it

Hes in a foul mood They study each other

trying

determine perhaps whos more powerful Eventually --

Goeth tries to put the situation in perspective

GOETH
Scherner told me something else about
you

SCHINDLER

Yeah whats that

GOETH
That you know the meaning of the
word gratitude That its not some
vague thing with you like with some

guys

SCHINDLER
True

GOETH

You want to stay where you are You
got things going on the side things
are good you dont want anybody
telling you what to do -- I can

SCHINDLER

Goeth mulls it over his shrug saying maybe maybe

From another pocket perhaps not so valuable but then
who

knows a gold lighter Regarding this last item --

SCHINDLER
This I dont know maybe you can

and turning to leave
SCHINDLER

INT METALWORKS - PLASZOW - DAY
Goeth moves through the crowded metalworks like a
goodnatured
foreman nodding to this worker wishing that one a
good
morning He seems satisfied even pleased with the
level of
production Goldberg is with him They reach a
particular
bench a particular worker and Goeth smiles
pleasantly
GOETH
What are you making
Not daring to look up all the worker sees of Goeth is
the

starched cuff of his shirt

He finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the

Forty seconds

Again the rabbi works feverishly -- cutting crimping
sanding hearing the seconds ticking in his head -- and

finishing in thirty-five Goeth nods impressed

GOETH
Thats very good What I dont
understand though is -- youve

been working since what about six
this morning Yet such a small pile
of hinges

He understands perfectly So does Levartov he has just
crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds Goeth
stands

him against the workshop wall and adjusts his
shoulders He

pulls out his pistol puts it to the rabbis head and

pulls
the trigger click
GOETH
(mumble)
Christ --
Annoyed Goeth extracts the bullet-magazine slaps it
back
in and puts the barrel back to the mans head He pulls
the
trigger again and again theres a click
GOETH
God damn it --
He slams the weapon across Levartovs face and the
rabbi
slumps dazed to the floor Looking up into Goeths
face he
knows its not over As Goeth walks away --

No one confesses Goeth nods All right takes a rifle

from

a guard and shoots one of the workers at random With
this

added incentive he waits for someone to tell him who
stole

the chicken No one does

GOETH
Still nobody knows

He shrugs Okay points the rifle at another worker --
and a

boy of fourteen shuddering and weeping steps out of
line

GOETH
There we go

Goeth goes over to the boy and like a distant
relative to

a small child tries to get him to look at his face

MISS KRAUSE

They say that no one dies here They

say your factory is a haven They

indifference like in the portrait of Adolf Hitler on

worker has certain skills

Schindler send them all His place
is a haven didnt you know Its
not a factory its not an enterprise
of any kind its a haven for people
with no skills whatsoever

Sterns look is all innocence but Schindler knows
better

SCHINDLER
You think I dont know what youre
doing Youre so quiet all the time
I know

STERN
(with concern)
Are you losing money

SCHINDLER
No Im not losing money thats not
the point

STERN

What other point is --

SCHINDLER
(interrupts yells)
Its dangerous Its dangerous to
me personally

Silence Schindler tries to settle down Then --

SCHINDLER
You have to understand Goeths under
enormous pressure You have to think
of it in his situation Hes got
this whole place to run hes
responsible for everything that goes
on here all these people -- hes
got a lot of things to worry about
And hes got the war Which brings
out the worst in people Never the
good always the bad Always the

All right he does enjoy it so what
What do you expect me to do about
it

STERN
Theres nothing you can do Im not
asking you to do anything You came
into my office

But it isnt Stern who needs convincing its Schindler
himself Its doubtful he even realizes this but its

to Stern Schindler sighs either at the predicament
or at the fact that hes allowed Stern to place him
the middle of it He turns to leave hesitates He
a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with

He unstraps his watch hands it to Stern

They dont fear us because we have

because we have the power to kill
arbitrarily A man commits a crime

stare out over Goeths dark

he should know better We have him
killed we feel pretty good about

it Or

we kill him ourselves and we

feel even better Thats not power

though

thats justice Thats

different than power Power is when
we have every justification to kill --

and we

dont Thats power Thats

what the emperors had A man stole
something hes brought in before
the emperor he throws himself down

on the

floor he begs for mercy he

knows hes going to die and the
emperor pardons him This worthless
man He lets him go Thats power

Thats

power

It seems almost as though this temptation toward

this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the

merciful

emperor holds some appeal to Goeth Perhaps as he

out over his camp he imagines himself in the role

what the power Schindler describes might feel like

Eventually he g

on the porcelain He takes a deep breath to calm
himself

Then gestures grandly

Go ahead go on leave I pardon

of emperors hes supposed to be feeling But he doesnt
feel

Schindler glances away to the floor show nods to

Glancing back again he considers the SS men with great
sobriety

SCHINDLER
Yeah well in some eyes it doesnt
matter the amount we steal its
that we do it Each of us sitting at
this table

His thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither SS

The air seems thicker suddenly
SCHERNER
He doesnt deserve your loyalty
More important hes not worth you
making threats against us
SCHINDLER
Did I threaten anybody here I stated

a simple fact

The threat still stands despite Schindlers assurance
otherwise and they all know it So does Scherners

back to him and they all know that too But Schindler
grins and glancing away --

like theyre climbing into an oven

INT OFFICE - MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY

In a stiff-backed chair sits a very unlikely defender
racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth To an impassive SS

behind a desk Goeth tries to highlight extenuating
circumstances

GOETH
He likes women He likes good-looking
women He sees a good-looking woman
he doesnt think This guy has so
many women They love him Hes
married hes got all these women
All right she was Jewish he
shouldnt have done it But you didnt
see this girl I saw this girl This
girl was very good-looking

Goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk but his
like a wall

GOETH
They cast a spell on you you know

like I do you see this They have
this power its like a virus Some
of my men are infected with this
virus They should be pitied not

Goeth shifts in his chair he knows hes not getting

GOETH
Its a matter of money We can discuss
that Thatd be all right with me
In the silence that follows Goeth realizes he has made
serious error in judgment This man sitting soberly
him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable
SS COLONEL
Youre offering me a bribe
GOETH
A bribe No no please come on
a gratuity
Suddenly the man stands up and salutes which
confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank But
isnt saluting Goeth hes saluting the officer who has

stepped into the room behind him

SCHERNER
Sit down

The colonel sits back down Scherner pulls up a chair

an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man
suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to
chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into

We give you Jewish girls at five
marks a day Oskar you should kiss

us not them

Goeth laughs too loud drawing a weary glance from

Schindler smiles good-naturedly Hes out a little
for wear perhaps a little more subdued than usual

him away from the others taking him into his

GOETH
God forbid you ever get a real taste
for Jewish skirt Theres no future
in it No future They dont have a
future And thats not just good old-
fashioned Jew-hating talk Its policy
now

THE THIN GRAY SS OFFICER is back in front of the
swaying precariously a drink in his hand --

SS OFFICER
Gloomy Sunday again

Again they play the song Again he staggers across the
room to his chair in the corner paying no attention to

the
visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else --
TREBLINKA GUY
-- We can process at Treblinka if
everything is working I dont know
maybe two thousand units a day
He shrugs like its nothing or with modesty its
unclear
Goeth is dully impressed Schindler only politely so
TREBLINKA GUY
Now Auschwitz Now youre talking
What I got is nothing its like
a a machine Auschwitz though
now theres a death factory There
they know how to do it There they
know what theyre doing

almost
gratefully wrenching from the song all the
sentimentality
they can as if they could actually drive him to kill
himself
No one else in the room is aware of the exchange going
on
between them -- this man and this music -- which the

Approaching him furious he hesitates He sees a
trundled by Pfefferberg a corpse in it He fears the
is Milas but then sees her trundling another barrow
corpse in it Goeth calls to Schindler --

GOETH
Can you believe this

Goeth shakes his head dismayed Schindler joins him

stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging
workers layer upon layer

GOETH
Im trying to live my life they
come up with this I got to find
every body buried up here And burn
it

Its always something He glances off The pyre has
the height of a mans shoulder The workers move around
dousing it with gasoline

they didnt have a future I didnt

Under Department W provisions it is
unlawful to kill a worker without
just cause Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund I am entitled to
file damage claims for such deaths
If you shoot without thinking you
go to prison and I get paid thats
how it works So there will be no
summary executions here There will
be no interference of any kind with
production In hopes of ensuring
that guards will no longer be allowed
on the factory floor without my
authorization

His eyes meet Liepolds hold his icy stare then

the guards most of whom look like tired middle-aged
reservists

For your cooperation you have my
gratitude

From high above the factory Stern can be seen among
machines talking with a worker The man points up and
to his work

Stern stares up puzzled He locates a ladder that

the shop-floor to a series of overhead planks and with
trepidation climbs

He reaches a shaky landing high above the machines

Above the rim of the tank amid rising steam

head appears Then disappears Stern climbs a set of

the steaming water Schindler and the blonde

from the trial

STERN
Excuse me

Neither Schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit
embarrassed Only Stern He tries hard to pretend the

isnt there but he just cant

STERN
Ill talk to you later

SCHINDLER
No no what what is it

Schindler floats over closer to him waits for him to
whatever it is he has come to report leans closer
quietly --
STERN
Do you have any money I dont know
about Hidden away someplace

Schindler thinks long and hard

SCHINDLER
No

Silence except for the gently lapping water Half-

In the distance a lone boxcar stark against the
landscape There are patches of snow on the ground A
wind blows through bare trees

INT MACHINE SHOP - BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY

Tight on Poldek Pfefferbergs eyes behind a welders

He turns from his work to the voice welding torch in
hand

EXT RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAY

The torch firing at ice as hard as metal blue flame

steam Pfefferbergs eyes behind the mask again
concentrating

Around the abandoned boxcar in the gruesome cold
Schindler Emilie a doctor some workers and some SS
watching waiting

Pfefferberg steps back Sledge hammers pound at locks
Hands pull at levers The doors begin to slide

Out of darkness from inside the boxcar as the doors
open Schindlers face is revealed tight He stares
interminable moment before walking slowly away

Inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs a pyramid of

frozen white
From a distance a tableau the boxcar the workers and

guards

and Emilie outside it Schindler off to himself
several

steps away all of them still as statues

EXT CATHOLIC CEMETERY - OUTSIDE BRINNLITZ - DAY

Beyond a country church among the stone markers of a
small

cemetery walk Schindler and a priest

SCHINDLER
Its been suggested I cremate them
in my furnaces As a Catholic I will
not As a human being I will not

The priest nods he seems relatively empathic He
offers an
alternative --

PRIEST
heres an area beyond the church
eserved for the burial of suicides
aybe I can convince the parish
ouncil to allow them to be buried
here

cakKH

SCHINDLER
These arent suicides

The priest knows that But he also knows that the
provisions

of Canon Law regarding who can and cannot be buried in

consecrated ground are narrow

SCHINDLER
These are victims of a great murder

INT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

In a corner of the factory workers hammer at pine

lumber

They are building coffins

EXT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

As workers harness horses to carts others hoist the
coffins

into them Schindler is there watching He glances up

EXT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

Beyond the wire Rabbi Levartov leads the horse-drawn

Around him walk a minyan -- a quorum of ten males

for the rite A few guards lag behind

INT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY

Work continues but its apparent in their eyes they
only physically here in spirit they are all walking
the carts one great moral force

The roar of a machine suddenly inexplicably dies
another And another Schindler standing at the main
panel pulls the last of the switches and the factory
into absolute silence

EXT CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY

Just beyond the perimeter of the Catholic cemetery the
quickly and quietly recites Kaddish over the dead as
coffins are lowered into individual graves

Then there is only a low breathing of wind

EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - ANOTHER DAY

Amon Goeth in civilian clothes emerges from a car
eyes sallow from inadequate sleep sweep across the
compound with envy Its a nice place Oskars got here

Schindler appears beside Stern glances down Hes lost

Alone down there he seems disoriented

SCHINDLER
Probably looking for a handout

INT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY
Workers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit

their foulest dreams -- Amon Goeth crossing through the
factory

Schindler his arm around the killers shoulder as if
were a long lost brother leads him across the shop-

proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering Hilo

INT OFFICES BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

Schindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet

it on his desk snaps it open revealing clothes

uniforms his medals The ex-Oberstrumfuhrer touches

fabric gently then glances up gratefully to his
GOETH

Thank you

Warmed by cognac and friendship Goeth comes through
factory again carrying the suitcase Schindler at his
steering him to some degree

Goeths hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away
bothersome fly But it isnt a fly One of the workers
spit on him He turns in disbelief

Silence as his hand drops to his side to the holster
forgets isnt there He glances around for SS guards
arent there He looks to Schindler thoroughly

and whispers --

GOETH
Where are the guards

SCHINDLER

The guards arent allowed on the

factory floor They make my workers

nervous
Goeth stares at him bewildered Then again at the
spit Then at other workers the resolve in their eyes
They know he has no power here and sense he has no
anywhere His own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in

lap knitting needles in her hands Is this a dream

SCHINDLER
Ill discipline him later

Schindler good-naturedly throws an arm around Goeths
and leads him away The workers watch as the two
disappear out the factory doors

in static several different voices in several

none of them lasting more than a moment

Depression hangs over the barracks Most of the guards
straining to hear the news theyve been fearing for
time now some on their bunks just staring one at a
peering out at the black face of a forest as if

at any moment to see Russian or American troops

INT WORKERS BARRACKS - SAME TIME - EVENING

voice of Winston Churchill

Schindler on Liepolds doorstep The two men
each other across the threshold Radio static filters
from Liepolds room The word Eisenhower cuts through
the speakers voice is buried again
SCHINDLER

Its time the guards came into the

factory
He turns and walks away
INT BRINNLITZ FACTORY - NIGHT
All twelve hundred workers and all the guards are
for the first time on the factory floor Tension and

uncertainty surround them Its ominously quiet Then -

SCHINDLER
The unconditional surrender of Germany
has just been announced At midnight
tonight the war is over
his

doubts

thoroughly

where

SS as

remain

like

It is not his intention to elicit celebration Indeed
words echoing and fading in the factory echo the
they all feel

SCHINDLER
Tomorrow youll begin the process
of looking for survivors of your
families In many cases you wont
find them After six long years of
murder victims are being mourned
throughout the world

Not by Untersturmfuhrer Liepold He stands with his
dying to lift his rifle and fire

SCHINDLER

Weve survived Some of you have
come up to me and thanked me Thank
yourselves Thank your fearless Stern
and others among you who worrying
about you have faced death every
moment

(glancing away)
Thank you

Hes looking at the guards thanking them which
confuses the workers Just when they thought they knew
his sentiments lay hes thanking guards
SCHINDLER

Youve shown extraordinary discipline

Youve behaved humanely here You

should be proud
Or is he attempting to adjust reality to destroy the
combatants to alter the self-image of both the guards

the prisoners Moving across the SS mens faces they

inscrutable Schindler turns his attention back to the
workers and not at all like a confession but rather

simple statements of fact

Im a member of the Nazi party Im

free and I will be hunted

(pause)
ll remain with you until five
minutes after midnight After which
time and I hope youll forgive me
have to flee

That worries the workers Whenever he leaves something
terrible always seems to happen

SCHINDLER
n memory of the countless victims
among your people I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence

In the quiet in the silence drifting slowly across
faces of the workers -- the elderly the lame

wives beside husbands children beside their parents
together -- it becomes clear if it wasnt before that
as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise the

camp has been one long sustained confidence game
Schindler has never stood still so long in his life He
now though framed by his giant Hilo machines silent
the close of the noisiest of wars his head bowed

the many dead

When he finally does look up he sees that he is the

do so The faces few of which he recognizes are all

at him He turns to speak to the guards along the wall

Apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave

Pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his

His ragtag irregulars do the same the rest of their

SCHINDLER
Now would be the time to do it
Theyre all here This is your
opportunity

The guards hold their weapons as they have from the
they arrived here tonight at attention waiting it

to be given the official order from their Commander
who appears ready to give it

SCHINDLER
Or
(he shrugs)
»you could leave And return to
your families as men instead of
murderers

Long long silence Finally one of the guards slowly

his rifle breaks ranks and walks away Then another

another And another Another

When the last is gone the workers consider Liepold
appears more an oddity than a threat He is more an

than a threat And he knows it He turns and leaves
EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT

A watchtower Abandoned The perimeter wire No

The guard barracks Deserted The SS is long gone
EXT COURTYARD - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT

Schindler and Emilie emerge from his quarters each

He
a small suitcase In the dark some distance away from
his

Mercedes stand all twelve hundred workers As
Schindler and

his wife cross the courtyard to the car Stern and

Levartov
approach The rabbi hands him some papers
LEVARTOV
Weve written a letter trying to
explain things In case youre
captured Every worker has signed
it
Schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the
typewritten text and continuing for several pages He
pockets
it this new list of names
SCHINDLER
Thank you
Stern steps forward and places a ring in Schindlers
hand

Its a gold band like a wedding ring Schindler
notices an
inscription inside it

STERN
Its Hebrew It says Whoever saves
one life saves the world

Schindler slips the ring onto a finger admires it a

moment
nods his thanks then seems to withdraw
SCHINDLER
(to himself)
I couldve got more out
Stern isnt sure he heard right Schindler steps away
from

him from his wife from the car from the workers

SCHINDLER
(to himself)
I couldve got more if Id just
I dont know if Id just I

couldve got more

Oskar there are twelve hundred people
who are alive because of you Look

at them
He cant

There will be generations because of
what you did

SCHINDLER
didnt do enough

STERN
You did so much

Schindler starts to lose it the tears coming Stern

too
The look on Schindlers face as his eyes sweep across
the
faces of the workers is one of apology begging them to
forgive him for not doing more
SCHINDLER
This car Goeth wouldve bought this
car Why did I keep the car Ten
people right there ten more I
couldve got
(looking around)
This pin --
He rips the elaborate Hakenkreus the swastika from
his

lapel and holds it out to Stern pathetically

SCHINDLER
Two people This is gold Two more
people He wouldve given me two for
it At least one He wouldve given
me one One more One more person A
person Stern For this One more I
couldve gotten one more person I
didnt

emotion

consuming him

They killed so many people
(Stern weeping too
embraces him)
They killed so many people

From above from a watchtower Stern can be seen down

trying to comfort Schindler Eventually they separate
Schindler and Emilie climb into the Mercedes It slowly
out through the gates of the camp And drives away
EXT BRINNLITZ - NIGHT

A panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire
the camp and just sits there growling like a beast

it fires a shell at nothing in particular at the night
an exhibition of random spite -- then turns around and
back into the forest

EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT

From a watchtower a couple of workers having

tanks display of impotent might can make little sense
it Below many of the workers mill around the yard

to be liberated No one seems to know what else to do
EXT BRINNLITZ - DAY

Some Czech partisans emerge from the forest They come

the hill and casually approach the camp Reaching the
theyre met by Pfefferberg and some other workers
slung over their shoulders

Through the fence --

The partisan shrugs Suit yourself and wanders back

EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT
Five headlights appear out of the night five
marked with the SS Deaths-head insignia They turn
road leading to the camp gate and park the riders

off the engines

Shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp
Several armed and dangerous Jews

EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - LATER - NIGHT

As the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed

EXT BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAWN

A lone Russian officer on horseback tattered coat
reins emerges from the forest As he draws nearer it
apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard
the horse is a mere pony the Russians feet in

nearly touching the ground beneath the animals skinny
abdomen

He reaches the camp climbs easily down from the horse
in a loud voice addresses the hundreds of workers
at the fence

RUSSIAN
You have been liberated by the Soviet
Army

This is it This one man The workers wait for him to

more He waits for them to move to leave to go home

RUSSIAN
Whats wrong

A few of the workers come out from behind the fence to
with him

WORKER
Have you been in Poland

RUSSIAN
I just came from Poland

Are there any Jews left

The Russian has to think Eventually he shrugs no
that he saw and climbs back onto his pony to leave
