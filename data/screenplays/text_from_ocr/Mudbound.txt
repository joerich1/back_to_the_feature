Screenplay by
Virgil Williams
and
Dee Rees

Based on the international bestselling novel
by Hillary Jordan
OVER BLACK we hear the distant rumble of THUNDER
FADE IN
TIGHT ON THE FACE OF JAMIE MCALLAN (Caucasian 20s)

Black eye Cut lip He looks like a beaten prize fighter
who is dripping in sweat and mud WIDEN TO REVEAL we are

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM - IN A HOLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The ash colored storm clouds make it look like night Jamie
scrapes the muck off his shovel blade and resumes The mud
is so thick it’s like digging into raw meat

A distant lightning flash accompanied by THUNDER Jamie ups
his urgency as he chops at the wet earth An upside down
face appears in the hole’s opening It’s HENRY MCALLAN
(Caucasian late 40’s) Jamie’s salt-of-the-earth older
brother Henry is a man of few words who rarely smiles
They speak with the lilting garble of the Mississippi Delta

HENRY
My turn Take a break

JAMIE
We ain’t gonna make it

HENRY
We will We have to

Henry extends his hand and helps Jamie out of the hole

Then as Henry maneuvers his way into the hole we see that he
moves with a noticeable limp Jamie pulls a handkerchief
from his pocket and wipes mud from his face and hands As he
watches Henry dig we hear Jamie’s VOICE OVER

JAMIE (VO)

We will We have to That was my
brother Henry absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would
The weather would dry out in time
to resow the cotton Next year
would be a better year We would
get this hole dug before the storm
hit

(beat)
And his little brother would never
betray him

LIGHTNING and THUNDER Jamie looks up and sees angry black
clouds eating up the sky Then from inside the hole we hear
a CLANG as Henry’s shovel hits something hard
HENRY
Dammit

JAMIE
What is it

HENRY
Piece of rock I think

Henry shoves his hand into the mud to pull out the rock But
what he retrieves is actually a human skull missing a big
chunk in the back They trade a look Henry keeps digging
alternating between shovel and bare hands as he discovers the
rest of the skeleton A collarbone scapula and ribs

HENRY (CONTD)
No no no Oh Lord It ain’t
right This just ain’t right

Henry digs out the pelvis and leg bones We hear a metallic
CLINK Henry unearths the tibia and sees a crude rusted
iron shackle with a broken chain dangling from it

HENRY (CONTD)
Jesus This is a slave’s grave

JAMIE
You don’t know that

HENRY
See here Shot in the head
Must’ve been a runaway
(extending a grimy hand)
That settles it Help me out

JAMIE
Settles what

HENRY
I won’t bury our father in a
slave’s grave There’s nothing he
would’ve hated more

JAMIE
We don’t have a choice

More LIGHTNING and THUNDER

The brothers hold a look Henry knows Jamie is right

TIME CUT TO
EXT THE MCALLAN FARM - THE HOLE - DAY - LATER

The hole has grown longer and deeper and is now a foot over
Jamies head - a proper grave Henry’s face appears in the
opening of the hole

HENRY
Yep that should do it

Jamie hands the shovel up But then when Henry tries to
help Jamie out it’s no use The hole is too deep their
hands are too wet and the walls are too slick

HENRY (CONTD)
Ill fetch the ladder

Jamie nods and Henry moves off As the squelch of Henry’s
boots steadily grows quiet we see the pain and worry in
Jamies eyes All around him is oozing mud And overhead is
a crude rectangle of darkening gray

Then we hear the staccato pitter-patter of RAIN DROPS Jamie
looks up and they begin to hit his face At first just a
few but then they come faster Jamie tries to climb out
again But he slips back in Another try and this time he
almost makes it before sliding back down

Jamies panic rises as he tries to claw out of the hole But
it’s futile as his fingers cut through the mud like butter

JAMIE
Henry HENRY

The rain falls harder as the storm hits it’s stride And the
hole is already starting to fill with water Jamie’s eyes
grow wild as he suddenly throws himself against the walls
like a trapped animal

ON HENRY

As he limps back towards the hole with the ladder he hears
Jamie screaming

JAMIE (0S) (CONTD)
HENRY

Henry hustles back to the hole but Jamie is too frantic to
notice

HENRY
Jamie Jamie I’m here
Jamie snaps out of it as Henry lowers the ladder Jamie
scrambles up and promptly doubles over trying to quell the
panic

HENRY (CONT’D)
You alright

JAMIE
I thought maybe you decided to
leave me down there

HENRY
Why would I do that

Jamie glances up Henry’s looking at him like he’s crazy
Jamie hauls up the ladder and moves off

JAMIE
Come on Let’s get this over with

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - DAY

ON PAPPY MCALLAN (60S) eyes closed his expression
tranquil He is dressed as we will see him throughout in
his Sunday best WIDEN TO REVEAL Jamie and Henry standing
over him Henry pulls a sheet over Pappy’s face then regards
the ramshackle coffin made of mismatched scrap wood

HENRY
I wish to hell we’d been able to
get to town

Jamie moves to Pappy’s feet and Henry to his head as they get
to putting the body in the coffin As they lift

HENRY (CONTD)
Gently now

JAMIE
Right wouldn’t want to hurt him

HENRY
(sharp)
That’s not the point

JAMIE
Sorry brother I’m just tired

With ludicrous care they lower the corpse into the box
Henry reaches for the lid and starts to put it on

HENRY
Go on I’11l finish up here

Jamie nods and throws a last look at the corpse We STAY WITH
him as he drifts outside to the porch A HAMMER STRIKING A
NAIL gives him pause He produces an almost empty bottle of
bourbon from his back pocket He downs it

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - DAY

The rain and wind have slowed down ON A PAIR OF BOOTS as
they trudge through thick ankle-deep mud WIDEN TO REVEAL
that the boots belong to LAURA MCALLAN (Caucasian 30s)
She follows Jamie and Henry who carry the coffin Laura is
more plain than pretty and there’s a tired strength in her
eyes She stumbles in the muck and we hear her VOICE OVER

LAURA (VO)
When I think of the farm I think of
mud Encrusting knees and hair
Marching in boot shaped patches
across the floor I dreamed in
brown

The procession arrives at the grave Henry and Jamie set the
coffin down and work ropes underneath it as Laura looks on
The ropes slip the coffin tumbles to the ground Wood
GROANS and there’s a loud CRACK from inside

HENRY
Dammit

JAMIE
What if we stand at either end and
run the ropes lengthwise

HENRY
Coffin’s too narrow It falls
again it could break open

Jamie shrugs “so what”

HENRY (CONTD)
No

Laura reacts to a mule pulled wagon she sees approaching

LAURA
The Jacksons

As the wagon gets closer we see the JACKSONS HAP and
FLORENCE ride up front with their youngest RUEL Behind
them their children MARLON and LILLY MAY Henry
moves towards them

LAURA (CONTD)
Henry don’t
HENRY
Snot my fault what happened

LAURA
Just let them go

HENRY
Leaving us in the middle of the
season Least they can do is lend
a hand

Laura and Jamie trade a look as Henry waves the wagon down
Hap’s eyes are tight and cold as he clucks the horses to a
stop Laura ventures a nod at Florence Florence ignores her

HENRY (CONTD)
Can you help us out here

Hap considers Jamie The cracked coffin sinking into the mud

HENRY (CONTD)
Hap

Florence puts a hand on Hap’s hand They look to each other
for an answer that isn’t there Laura shifts her weight
looks away from Henry

LAURA (VO)
I was a thirty one year old virgin
when I met Henry McAllan in the
Spring of 1939

INT LAURA’S MEMPHIS HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

ON LAURA mud-free and squeaky clean She is smiling coyly
and we WIDEN TO REVEAL that she’s sitting across from Henry
who is quiet and inscrutable throughout The other guests at
the dinner table Laura’s brother TEDDY (late 20’s) and her
MOTHER and FATHER (50s) This place is a sharp contrast to
the farm It’s light and pristine with clean napkins and
crisp white shirts Laura’s V0O

LAURA (VO)
I lived with my parents in the
house I grew up in My world was
small and he was my rescuer from a
life in the margins

Laura’s mother has sniffed out the sparks between Laura and
Henry Mom gives Henry the hard sell with a smile as Laura
squirms in the spotlight
LAURAS MOTHER
Oh an engineering degree from Ole
Miss lLaura’s a college graduate
got her teaching certificate from
West Tennessee State

TEDDY
Oh my dear sister’s the smartest
one in the family Made better
grades than I ever did
(winking to Henry)
Never heard the end of it

LAURA’S MOTHER

Laura why don’t you play some
piano after dinner

(to Henry re Laura)
You really must hear her sing

(to Laura)
You should play something for Mr
McAllan later

LAURA
Momma

LAURA’S MOTHER

How about that hymn y’all did at
service last Sunday Or Ave Maria
that’s beautiful

LAURA
Momma

LAURAS MOTHER
What

LAURA

I’m quite sure that Teddy did not
bring his new boss Mr McAllan
over to hear hymns

LAURAS MOTHER
Well let’s ask him then Mr
McAllan would you like to hear
some music later

Eyes turn to Henry as he finishes a bite of food and wipes
his mouth

Laura

HENRY
I like hymns

INTEXT LAURA’S MEMPHIS HOME - NIGHT

Laura opens the door to REVEAL Henry with a bouquet of
flowers She smiles surprised

LAURA (VO)

I was unused to male admiration and
knew only that I wanted more It
was at least a reprieve from the
sincere pity and insincere kindness
directed at old maids

INT MOVIE THEATER

Laura and Henry gazing at the big screen She steals a
glance at him

LAURA (VO)

He didn’t feel the need to fill the
air with words like I did He had
the self confidence I lacked He
was after all a veteran of the
Great War

EXT OVERTON PARK - DAY

Henry and Laura walk hand in hand The dogwood trees are
blooming and flurries of white petals flit on gentle breezes
Henry picks a petal out of Laura’s hair and they hold a look

LAURA (VO)

Though he never spoke of it his
limp was a constant reminder of his
brave sacrifice I can’t say that
I was truly in love with him but I
was so grateful to him it dwarfed
everything else

Henry takes her face in his hands grinds a kiss onto her
mouth Laura recovers tries a smile waits for some
tenderness a grand romantic declaration--

HENRY
My brother Jamie’s coming up from
Oxford in a few weeks Id like
for him to meet you

INT TRAIN STATION - DAY

Jamie

Henry scans the crowd smiles

HENRY (CONTD)
There

Henry points Jamie strides through the crowd He is fresh
clean beautiful Henry moves to him as fast as limp will
permit A warm rocking hug They step back and study each
other’s faces

JAMIE
You look good brother

HENRY
Likewise

JAMIE
The air up here in Memphis agrees
with you
(looking at Laura)
Or is it something else

Jamie throws Laura a movie star smile And she is
immediately taken by his charm

HENRY
This is Miss Chappell
(to Laura)
My brother Jamie

LAURA
Pleased to meet you

JAMIE
The pleasure is all mine

With exaggerated gallantry Jamie takes Laura’s offered hand
and kisses it

HENRY
He thinks he’s a character in one
of his plays

LAURA
Henry tells me you’re studying
theater at Ole Miss

JAMIE
(forefinger in the air)
Ah but which play dear brother
Hamlet Faust Prince Hal

HENRY
Hopefully one of them fellas can
earn you a decent wage someday

JAMIE
What do you think Miss Chappell

LAURA
I think you’re more of a Puck

Jamie is impressed and the dazzle in his smile shows it

JAMIE
Dear lady thou speakest right I
am that merry wanderer of the
night

HENRY
Who’s Puck

JAMIE
(mock despair)
Lord what fools these mortals be

Despite being older Henry has always been in Jamie’s shadow

LAURA
Puck’s a kind of mischievous
sprite

JAMIE

A hobgoblin Forgive me I’m only
trying to impress her

HENRY
Laura’s not the impressionable
type

JAMIE

Good for her
Jamie smiles and winks at Laura
INT MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT
WELL-HEELED GUESTS lounging on Queen Anne couches BLACK

SERVANTS buzz about with trays A BLACK BIG BAND plays
something watered-down swing
It’s not a pleasant memory for Henry
SERVANT refreshes their champagne

Laura Henry and Jamie giggling in a lush nook
Laura is rapt Henry’s heard it

JAMIE
Next thing I knew I was sucked
under concussed and bleeding I
was as good as gone Another
victim of the great flood of twenty-
seven

LAURA
I can’t believe you never told me
this
(to Jamie)
Then what happened

JAMIE

I saw a glimmering light Like a
fallen star

(wiggling his fingers)
And a great big hand reached out of
it Thought it was God himself
come to take me But it wasn’t
It was my dear big brother Henry

LAURA
(smiling to Henry)
You saved his life You’re a hero

JAMIE
He is indeed

HENRY
What else was I supposed to do
Let him drown

HENRY (CONTD)
That’1l1 do--

JAMIE
Weve barely had any Don’t worry
Henry I’ve got more stamina than
you--

Jamie tips the servant’s hands extends the pour

HENRY
What from modeling clothes Don’t
know how you do that Seems so
undignified for a man

Jamie is mid-

As he shrugs it off a

JAMIE

Well have plenty of time later for
you to evaluate my life choices
brother Tonight we celebrate

(raising his glass)
Here’s to the future Whatever it
may hold May you be blessed with
happiness health prosperity
and

(to Henry re Laura)
if she’ll have you maybe even a
house full of children My love to
you both

Said genuinely Laura is touched Despite himself Henry is
too They clink glasses and drink

LAURA
Ooh bubbly

Just then the band switches the beat and ups volume It’s
time to dance As couples start to move to the dance floor
Jamie looks to Henry

JAMIE
Would you mind terribly if I hada
dance with your girl
(off Henry’s shrug)
Miss Chappell Care to take a
spin

Laura looks to Henry Henry nods

ON THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie and Laura whirl Jamie’s got Fred Astaire moves But
this is new to Laura and she’s awkward Jamie patiently

leads and soon Laura’s swept off her feet For a while it
feels like it’s just the two of them out there

LAURA (VO)
Jamie saw in a different way When
his eyes were on me I felt like I
was no longer invisible

Laura and Jamie lock eyes and the connection is overwhelming
The envious eyes of other women in the room Laura shrugs
off Henry’s questioning gaze The song ends Laura is
breathless

BACK AT THE TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie escorts Laura back to the table She’s flushed Henry
notices it

JAMIE
Excuse me I’11 be back

Jamie moves off and Henry looks to Laura

HENRY
You look especially pretty tonight

LAURA
Thank you

HENRY
Jamie has that effect on girls
They sparkle for him

(beat)
He likes you I can tell

LAURA
I’m sure he doesn’t dislike anyone

HENRY

At least not anyone in a skirt
(re the dance floor)

See what I mean

Laura looks and sees Jamie on the dance floor with a PRETTY
GIRL The girl effortlessly follows Jamie through a series
of turns and dips Laura suddenly feels foolish and tries to
cover it as she sips her champagne glass empty Henry refills
it

LAURA (VO)
Henry’s marriage proposal didn’t
play out like I’d pictured it
would He wasn’t kneeling and the
question actually came out as more
of a statement Henry wasn’t a
romantic He was made of sturdier
stuff But he was a good hard
working man And he loved me And
I knew that he would provide be
true and give me children And
for that I could certainly love
him in return

Laura steals glances at Jamie dancing and smiling

that would never be theirs They

Yet this man this place this law
say you need a deed All the blood
and sweat and dying with dirt under
your fingernails don’t count
Doesn’t make it yours Say you need
a deed not Deeds So what good is
a deed A deed is a piece of paper
One of my great-uncles Uncle
William got ahold of a piece of
land during reconstruction A good
piece of land right next to the
river He had a deed Had his piece
of paper and all Four white men
rode up on horses one day aimed
they pistols said it was theirs
My uncle’s good deed torn into
forty pieces and thrown to the
wind It was too good you see The
land he had claimed And so I ask
what good is a deed

The house is a large rickety shack with a deserted air It
has a warped tin roof and shuttered windows with neither

sucks her foot out her nice shoes are ruined

war are everywhere RONSEL sits atop his tank writing a
letter His tank is dirty and as beat up as he is

RONSEL (VO)
I’ve been keeping busy mostly
training and looking for Germans
Luckily we haven’t seen too many

That’s clearly a lie as Ronsel eyes a red-crossed ambulance
full of wounded soldiers driving by He continues writing

RONSEL (VO)
Of course by the time you get
this Ill probably be long gone
from here We seem to always be on
the move

A gruff SERGEANT (Caucasian) comes marching down the line

SOLDIER who marches past

SOLDIER
Hey jig Wha’ch you doing up in

hurt yourself

Ronsel eyes him as he rolls on eventually passing a sign
that points towards MUNICH 10 km

for a spell the locals treat us
real nice They’re not like white
folks back home

With a bouquet of flowers a cleaned up Ronsel knocks on the
door and waits

Then a pretty German girl (RESL 20s) answers and smiles
she’s been expecting him He presents the flowers and she
hugs him The hug turns into a kiss

I’m mighty grateful for that I
get homesick and they do what they
can to make us feel right at home

As Ronsel and Resl kiss we PRELAP the sounds of BATTLE

We hear the PINGS and PANGS of bullets ricochetting off the
armor It’s claustrophobic and hot in here as Ronsel and the
4 other African-American crew members operate like fingers on
a hand Ronsel is the commander CLEVE is the driver and
Weeks is the gunner

RONSEL

WEEKS
Identified I got him

RONSEL
Fire

The shell is loaded and BOOM From Ronsel’s POV through the
view finder we see the German tank get hit and blow up

RONSEL (CONTD)
Woo Nice shot

Weeks smiles for a moment then contorts his face as he RIPS
A LONG FART The guys in the tank react

CLEVE
Goddamn Weeks

WEEKS
It’s them C-rations Franks and
beans

RONSEL
We should load you in the gun and
fire you at the Jerries theyd
surrender quick

The whole crew busts up laughing But the laughter is cut
short by a VIOLENT BLAST Shrapnel flies and metal twists
Weeks absorbs the blow and gets most of his head blown off
Ronsel gets knocked back and splattered by blood and brains

Then there is RINGING and BLURRED FOCUS as Ronsel gets his
bearings Soon he comes to and sees a FIRE in the tank

Get outta the tank Get out

His eyes are drawn out the window PARACHUTISTS escaping

Would see me in the daylight But

Sunlight fills the room where Ronsel and Resl sleep
peacefully entwined We notice a delicate gold necklace with

acrucifix hanging from Resl’s neck A few quiet beats then
a cacophony of HORN HONKS and JEEP ENGINES crescendos

Ronsel wakes quickly but Resl snoozes on Then outside he
hears HOOTS and HOLLERS

Ronsel extracts himself from Resl’s sleepy embrace and moves
to the window There he sees a procession of American
soldiers hanging off jeeps and trucks waving American flags

SOLDIERS OUTSIDE
Wars over Hitler’s dead The
war’s over

Ronsel watches them wondering if it’s true Resl joins him
at the window as the impromptu victory parade rolls by

They look at each other both knowing what it means he’s
going home soon A melancholy embrace Ronsel closes his
eyes

truck bed and Jamie hops in the driver’s side Both of them
are aware of the men still watching from the porch

INT HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Jamie steals looks at Ronsel through the back window squirms
with guilt Memories of the B25 echo in his ears Ronsel
oblivious to it chasing his daydreams flitting across the
landscape Jamie pulls over

JAMIE
Come on up front

RONSEL
I’m doing just fine back here

JAMIE
Get in soldier That’s an order

A beat then the truck rocks as Ronsel hops off and gets in
the passenger side

RONSEL
How do you know you outranked me

JAMIE
I was a captain

RONSEL
We had Negro captains I served
under plenty

JAMIE
(shrugging)
You obeyed my order Bet you were
a sergeant

RONSEL

Fighting” Spearheaded for Patton
You

JAMIE
I flew B-25’s

Jamie reaches into the grocery bag between them and takes out
the bourbon bottle He uncorks it then takes a long much
needed swig and drives on

JAMIE (CONTD)
So sergeant how do you like being
back here in the Delta

Ronsel doesn’t answer he just looks away

JAMIE (CONTD)
Yeah me too
(beat)
Heard you and my Pappy had words

RONSEL
(stiffening)
I apologized for that

Then to Ronsel’s surprise Jamie toasts with the bottle

JAMIE
He’s a disagreeable sonovabitch
I’m sure he had it coming
(offering the bourbon)
Here’s to you

RONSEL
No thanks

JAMIE
You always this stubborn Or is it
just around white people trying to
be nice

Ronsel eyes Jamie then he grabs the bottle takes a quick
sip and tries to hand it back

JAMIE (CONTD)
What kind of NCO are you

Then Ronsel takes a big swig So big it makes him choke and
spill a little Jamie laughs

JAMIE (CONTD)
Don’t waste it now That’s my
medicine I need every drop

Ronsel admits a slight grin as he recovers and hands the
bottle back Jamie takes a pull then

JAMIE (CONTD)
Hey you tanker boys ever piss in
your helmets

RONSEL
Plenty of times
JAMIE
We had relief tubes up in the
cockpit but sometimes it was easier
just to use our flak helmets And
at twenty thousand feet That piss
freezes solid in less than minute

RONSEL
It’s that cold up there

JAMIE

I’m talking twenty thirty below
zero And one time we were on this
long haul and I went in my helmet
and forgot all about it Then when
we got close to the target I put
the helmet back on And were
doing our bombing run dodging
enemy flak and suddenly I feel
something running down my face

JAMIE (CONTD)
I smelled like a damn latrine

RONSEL
You must’a caught hell back at the
officer’s club

JAMIE
My buddies never let me hear the
end of it
(beat)
The ones that made it back anyway

RONSEL
Yeah Lost some friends myself

They drive on in silence

INT HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK - LATER

They both laugh as Jamie passes the bottle back to Ronsel

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM OUTHOUSE- DAY

Laura sloshes through ankle deep mud trudges to the leaning
outhouse

Laura opens the door to the BUZZING of flies It’s a hot day
and the smell in here is oppressive Breathing though her
mouth she lifts her skirt squats and pees She looks down
at the mud caked onto her boots and the hem of her dress

SERIES OF SHOTS LAURA’S TORTUOUS BATHING RITUAL

LAURA (VO)
Saturday was my favorite day of the
week

to the stove

It was the only day I felt truly
clean

bathes her muddy DAUGHTERS The water turns brown

--The girls clean-washed and napping on the porch LAURA
lowers herself into their cloudy lukewarm leftovers Laura
cups water over herself squats in the fleeting privacy of a
flapping sheet PAPPY happens by averts his eyes a little
too slowly

“Congratulations Love Jamie” Laura closes her eyes and
draws in the scent of the flowers

Then suddenly she has to pee like a pregnant lady

LAURA (CONTD)
Ooh excuse me Nature calls

Jamie and Ronsel stumble from the truck to the dilapidated
saw mill Ronsel hesitates

JAMIE
C’mon now we’re clear of town

(with a bourbon bottle)
Don’t make me drink alone I will
if I have to

Ronsel prys at a loose board
RONSEL

Hope this damn thing don’t fall
down on us

INT SAW MILL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie and Ronsel shimmy in through a ragged gap It’s old
decrepit and laden with cobwebs Shafts of sunlight jut in
through the wooden slats

RONSEL
Used to come here when I was a boy
Whenever I needed to be alone and
think

JAMIE
Well I love what you’ve done with
the place

Jamie offers Ronsel a smoke Ronsel accepts and Jamie lights
his own then tosses Ronsel the lighter Ronsel lights up and
tosses the lighter back

RONSEL
Why you treating me so nice
JAMIE
Because you look like you could use
it
RONSEL
Bullshit

Jamie drags on his smoke and measures Ronsel with a drunken
eye Then

JAMIE
We were somewhere over Austria and
we made contact with a swarm of
Messerschmitts They were
everywhere

painted red And one of ‘em he
buzzed me after the fight When I
looked over I thought I was seeing

He was colored

The fighter pilot looks at Jamie and salutes Jamie returns
the favor Then the fighter plane rolls and peels off

BACK TO

own misery

Laura stooped rushing through her house She draws her
bloodied hand from between her legs Doubles over on the bed

AMANDA LEIGH
What’s wrong momma

She grunts and writhes her hands pressed to her belly

AMANDA LEIGH (CONTD)
Momma

LAURA
I need you to be a big girl and go
fetch Florence from her house Do

Amanda Leigh nods tightly Another cramp hits and it hurts

LAURA (CONT’D)
Go Run as fast as you can

Amanda Leigh takes off and Laura goes to the ground A
growing blood stain forms around her crotch

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laura lays in the bed alone staring at the ceiling Her
expression is stoic and empty She does not react when
Florence enters with food and drink

FLORENCE

cramps

LAURA
Thank you Florence For

Florence lingers sits next to her Then after several
beats Laura’s face twists in sorrow and she weeps Florence
holds her lets the sobs ring out

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laura sits at the edge of the bed staring at the wall Then
Henry enters He approaches and puts a hand on her shoulder
Laura lets it rest there for a beat then she gently shrugs
it off Henry is concerned

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Laura lays in bed curled up and depressed She reacts when
Amanda Leigh and Isabelle enter with wildflowers

AMANDA LEIGH
We brought you flowers momma

LAURA
Thank you sweetheart

Then Isabelle holds up a molted rattlesnake skin

ISABELLE
This is for you momma We found
it in the yard

Laura is repulsed but she feigns delight

LAURA
Oh my that’s wonderful darling
I’‘1ll treasure it
(then)
Go on back outside now and play

The girls scamper out and with two fingers Laura puts the
snake skin far away

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
Laura lays there catatonic We hold on her stillness for a

beat Then the silence is broken by HAMMERING Laura tries
to ignore it but it’s loud and incessant

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie hoists Amanda Leigh high over a new wooden stall
There’s a rope attached to a bucket and pulley contraption
mounted up top

JAMIE
Easy now

Amanda Leigh drops lavender bunches into the bucket of water

ISABELLE
Momma look Uncle Jamie’s building

JAMIE

(to the girls re Laura)
I thought y’all were supposed to
keep a look out and tell me if she
was coming

(then to Laura)
Surprise Thought you might like a
little privacy every now and then
Well what do you think

Laura stares at it truly touched by the gesture

LAURA
I think it’s marvelous Thank you

Laura hugs Jamie It feels good and she sinks into him And
there’s a pin prick of light in the dark tunnel of her
depression

HENRY
What’s this

Jamie and Laura quickly break the hug when Henry walks up

LAURA
Your brother built us a shower

HENRY
You don’t say

Henry checks out the handy work and Laura and Jamie trade a
quick glance

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM - SHOWER - SUNSET

Laura enters with a towel The deep thrum of insects and
frogs mingles with the distant sound of Amanda Leigh
practicing scales on the piano in the house

As Laura gets undressed she looks up and notices large clouds
stained with hues of pink and gold from the setting sun

She pulls the rope and the bucket tilts and pours water into
another bucket punctured with holes which creates a shower
effect Then she releases the rope and stops the water flow
Jamie was thoughtful enough to put in a soap dish In it is
a purple bar of soap Laura puts the soap to her nose and
draws in the scent Lavender She smiles and lathers up

Then she pulls the rope all the way and the entire bucket
starts pouring The water is warm and it feels wonderful
It’s been so long since she had a shower She rinses and it
feels so good it’s almost sensual

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM - DAY

Henry drives his tractor through thick mud The crops have
grown-in but the field is flooded and in bad shape Then the
tractor lurches and gets stuck Henry puts it in reverse and
the tires just spin and dig deeper Henry puts it in drive
and tries the other direction To no avail

HENRY
Dammit

EXT COTTON FIELD - DAY

Still on one crutch Hap works the wet overgrown field The
mud makes the hard work even harder He loses his footing
and falls He gets up more covered in mud than he was
before

Ronsel sit against a tree smoking a cigarette He’s gota
thousand yard stare as he mindlessly drags and exhales

Henry’s truck pulls up Jamie behind the wheel Ronsel hops
into the passenger side Florence doesn’t like what she
sees Then the truck pulls out and Florence watches it go

EXT JACKSON CABIN - DUSK

Florence leaning against the porch post gazing into the
distance Hap hobbles out on his still-splinted leg He leans
his crutches against the house puts his arms around her

tune Florence melts onto him

hangs on the humid air

JAMIE
Don’t be impressed I got it for
being stupid

RONSEL
What

JAMIE
I almost drowned in a flood when I
was a kid Since then baths
swimming pools any kind of water I
hate it And this one mission I
changed course so we wouldn’t be
over the water so long And as
luck would have it we ran smack
dab into some enemy flak A lot of
it But I managed to hit the
target and bring us all back

RONSEL
You so scared of water you’d rather
get shot at than fly over it

JAMIE
Damnedest thing ain’t it

They share a laugh and a drink then

JAMIE (CONTD)
You ever miss it sometimes Being
over there I don’t mean getting
shot at but I actually miss it

RONSEL
Me too Over there I was a
Liberator Had folks lined up on
the street cheering and throwing
flowers Back here I’m just
another nigger pushing a plow

When we were in Wimbourne English
gal I never laid eyes on patted me
right on the butt Told me she was
checking for a tail because the
white GI’s was saying we were more
monkey than human So we made sure
to show ‘em just how human we were
every opportunity we got

JAMIE
German girls too huh

RONSEL
Yeah Wellone in particular

Ronsel drifts with the memory of Resl wistful

JAMIE
Uh oh I’ve seen that look before
She must’a been something special

RONSEL
Yeah She was But that was then
And this is now I’m back home
Right where I belong

Said with a cut of drunken sarcasm

INT THE JACKSON’S CABIN - NIGHT

Crickets outside as Ronsel lays in bed by candlelight wide
awake He’s gazing at Resl’s gold necklace and crucifix
Then with resolve he stuffs it into a small tin box next to
his bed and closes the lid shut Then he blows out the
candle still wide awake as he tries to forget her

INT THE MCALLAN FARM - HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Henry snores loudly So loudly Laura is awake She shakes
him and he stops Then Laura settles in and tries to get

comfortable But after a few moments Henry starts snoring
again Finally Laura succumbs to the futility and gets up

EXT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Laura exits the house into the moonlight She is startled
when she nearly trips over Jamie who is passed out with an
empty bottle of bourbon Fully clothed and breathing heavily
from drink he is peaceful and pitiful all at once

JAMIE
Nonono I can’t swim I can’t swim

Laura turns and sees Jamie writhing in his sleep

JAMIE (CONT’D) LAURA
NO AHHHH AHHHHH Jamie Jamie wake up

Laura shakes him hard Jamie shoots to upright eyes
darting Then he looks to Laura as the sense creeps back
into him A beat then he starts crying She pulls him to
her and he sinks into her arms

After a few moments Henry appears in the doorway Neither
Laura nor Jamie notice him Henry says nothing He just
stands there watching their embrace jealousy in his eyes
Eventually Henry moves back into the house

Then Jamie rips himself away from Laura’s embrace

JAMIE (CONTD)
I gotta get outta here

blubbering incoherent He falls asleep across the wheel
Headlights still on

frowns over the Sheriff’s shoulder Jamie shudders struggles
with the car door Sheriff helps rip it open Jamie stumbles
into the light

SHERIFF THACKER

Jamie and Henry clamber out of the ditch in silence Jamie
is hungover and haggard

JAMIE

Henry shakes his head in disgust
INT THE MCALLAN FARM - BARN - DAY
Henry hammers repairs while Jamie finishes milking the cow
When Jamie stands he trips falls and spills milk everywhere
Jamie laughs

HENRY

You think it’s funny spilling good
milk

JAMIE
(slurring)
Well you know what they say no use
crying over it

HENRY
No especially when it’s somebody
elses

Jamie stops grinning and turns sarcastic as he reaches into
his pocket and produces some coins and crumpled bills

JAMIE
I see What do I owe you Henry
About a dollar and a half lLet’s
just say two to be safe

Jamie pushes the money at him Henry slaps his hand away and
the money goes flying A clumsy half-hearted fist-fight

HENRY
For Christ’s sake this ain’t about
the money

JAMIE
Then what do you want from me

HENRY
For you to be a man

JAMIE
One pail of spilled milk and I’m
not a man

HENRY
You’re sure not acting like one
Disappear for days at a time doing
whatever you damn well please And
when you are here you’re drunk

JAMIE
I don’t answer to you

HENRY
You do when you live in my house
and work on my farm

JAMIE
Oh well I’m real sorry about that
Mr Boss man But don’t take it
out on me because your little
farmer dream ain’t working Ain’t
my fault your crops are getting
flooded out

HENRY
Well you sure as hell ain’t helping
matters It’s like having another
goddamn child to look after

JAMIE
You need to open your eyes big
brother You’re so busy walking
around here like God almighty so
wrapped up in yourself and your
damn farm you can’t even see your
own wife is miserable

HENRY
Watch your mouth

JAMIE
Or what

Henry clenches his fists and squares up Jamie stands his
ground But Henry restrains himself

HENRY
Know what You be whatever kind of
Man you want Just go do it
someplace else

JAMIE
Fine I’ll go to town

HENRY
I don’t mean just for the night In
the morning I’m going to Greenville
for a few days to see about some
livestock I’11 expect you gone
when I get back

They hold a look neither man seeing clearly through the fog
of anger and pride Then Henry leaves Jamie in his wake

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - BARN - LATER

As Jamie packs his things frustrated angry He reacts when
Laura knocks at his open doorway

LAURA

Uhno

JAMIE

LAURA

Jamie keeps packing The suddenness of this new reality is a
bitter prospect for Laura

LAURA
Does your father know

JAMIE
I’1l go down to the river and find
the girls And Pappy I’11 just
leave him a note

LAURA
You don’t need to go Jamie When
Henry cools off he’1ll listen to me

Jamie stops packing for a moment and stares at the floor
Then he looks at her so much hurt in his eyes

JAMIE
Laura I can’t stay here I feel
like I’m suffocating I can’t
explain it

LAURA
You don’t need to

Laura runs her hand along his suitcase and wishes she could
run away with him Jamie tamps his pain tired of being
pathetic Laura moves to him close They gaze at each
other for a very long beat neither wanting to say goodbye

Then with alarming swiftness Laura grabs Jamie and kisses
him Deeply Hungrily Then suddenly he pushes her away
Both of them breathe heavily their hearts racing Then
Jamie pulls her close and they kiss again Clothes get torn
off as they tumble onto the bed Jamie and Laura devour each
other

INT THE JACKSON’S CABIN - DAY

And Ronsel heads out the front door

HAP
Where you going now Ronsel

RONSEL
Ill be back

EXT MISSISSIPPI ROAD - DAY

The grey horizon hints at a coming storm Ronsel walks
along a swirl of emotion shaking his head in disbelief as
he reads the letter

Then he reacts to the rising sound of an APPROACHING TRUCK
He quickly shoves the letter into his pockets The truck is
moving fast The glint from the windshield prevents us from
seeing the driver But we hear the engine rev higher as he
steps on the gas

Ronsel moves to the shoulder of the road But the truck
swerves in his direction and bears down on him Ronsel runs
and dives into a ditch just as the truck rumbles up and skids
to a fast stop Then surprisingly Jamie tumbles out
laughing and drunk He’s got a bottle of whiskey and he
looks like absolute hell

JAMIE
You should’a seen the look on your
face

RONSEL

It ain’t funny

JAMIE
Actually my friend it was indeed

Ronsel gets up and brushes himself off Jamie is still
smiling Then soon Ronsel can’t help but smile too

RONSEL
Youre crazy you know that right

JAMIE
Can’t argue with that No sir

Jamie takes a pull from the bottle and plops to the ground
mess Ronsel sees the state he’s in

RONSEL
Hey Is something the matter

Jamie gets quiet and picks at the label on the bottle

JAMIE
What’s the worst thing you ever
did

RONSEL

(after a beat)
That lady I told you about The
one at the prison camp

JAMIE
No I mean something that hurt
somebody real bad And you knew it
was gonna hurt ‘em but you did it
anyway

This time Ronsel gets quiet for a long beat Then he pulls
out the letter and a photo and hands it to Jamie

RONSEL
Leaving her

Jamie looks at the picture then reads the letter Then he
reacts and smiles

JAMIE
Well I’ll be Congratulations
You’re a father

RONSEL
His name’s Franz
JAMIE
Franz That’s a good name

(then)
So that’s the German girl

Ronsel nods and we finally see the photo It is of Resl
holding a swaddled baby Jamie hands the photo back to
Ronsel and holds up the bottle

JAMIE (CONTD)
Well this calls for a celebration
Here’s to Franz

Jamie takes a swig and hands Ronsel the bottle

RONSEL
To Franz

Then Ronsel takes a drink and gives the bottle back to Jamie

JAMIE
So what the hell are you gonna do

RONSEL
I have no idea She wants me to go
to Germany

JAMIE
Long way off

Ronsel nods he knows Jamie stares into the distance as
Ronsel stares at Franz Then

RONSEL
What about you What’s the worst
thing you ever done

Jamie looks at him his mind on Laura and their tryst But
Jamie smiles and covers

JAMIE
Who me I’ma saint

RONSEL
Oh yeah I bet

Then there’s a distant THUNDER RUMBLE The clouds on the
horizon are getting darker Jamie kills the whiskey bottle
and tosses it into the ditch

INT HENRY’S PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
Jamie and Ronsel pass a new bottle and sing in unison

They both react to an approaching car and stop singing

JAMIE
Oh shit put your head down

Ronsel ducks The dust makes it hard to see but the road is
narrow and soon they pass the oncoming car Orris drives and
Pappy rides shotgun Jamie looks forward and Ronsel keeps
his head low Pappy and Orris crane their necks as the
vehicles cross

RONSEL

The threat of thunder has turned into reality of pounding
rain Ronsel runs to the spot where he told Jamie about the
letter He looks around desperately He finds the empty
whiskey bottle with the label Jamie picked off

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - DAY

Laura is in the kitchen Amanda Leigh and Isabelle are on
the floor playing with building blocks Pappy lingers by the
window anxiously waiting

PAPPY

JAMIE
Because I was giving him a ride

PAPPY

JAMIE
He can ride wherever I say

Lucky Strikes Pappy snatches them It’s empty

EXT MISSISSIPPI ROAD - NIGHT

Rain as Ronsel trudges up the road Then he reacts to the
crescendo of approaching cars He turns and sees two sets of
headlights approaching fast

Ronsel jumps down into the ditch But instead of passing

the cars pull up and stop Ronsel is a bit blinded by the

headlights and the rain But soon several figures in white
sheets and hoods pile out of the cars and rush at him

Ronsel runs but they are on him like a pack of dogs He
fights and struggles landing several hard punches But he’s
outnumbered

INT THE MCALLAN FARM HOUSE - LEAN TO - NIGHT

Rain beats on the roof as Jamie sleeps on his cot A beat
then he is poked awake by Pappy’s cane Jamie bolts up
startled to see Pappy Orris Stokes and the Sheriff are
behind him in white robes

JAMIE
What the hell’s going on

PAPPY
Put your boots on and come with us

EXT SAW MILL - NIGHT

Hard rain Orris Stokes’ car pulls up and stops among some
other parked cars Jamie Pappy and Orris Stokes get out
and move towards the saw mill We can see torch lights
coming from inside the mill As they go the Sheriff and
Stokes don their white hoods This gives Jamie pause and he
stops But Stokes shoves him along

STOKES
Go on

They open the door to the saw mill and enter
INT SAW MILL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Inside are a group of men in KKK garb In the middle of the
mill is Ronsel He has a burlap sack over his head a noose
around his neck and his hands tied behind him He’s strung
up from a rafter his tip-toes barely touching the ground
One of the white hoods holds the other end of the rope
Another man (DEX) stands nearby with a shotgun
JAMIE
What’s going on here Pappy

PAPPY
Shut up

SHERIFF THACKER
(re Ronsel)
Take it off

Dex moves to Ronsel and yanks the sack off his head As his
eyes adjust to the light we see that Ronsel has been beat up

JAMIE
Good Lord Turn him loose

PAPPY
I said shut up

JAMIE
Like hell I will Turn him loose
dammit

Stokes pulls his pistol and levels it at Jamie

STOKES
You best listen son

JAMIE
I ain’t your son And I suggest
you either use that thing or point
it elsewhere

Jamie readies lunge at Stokes

PAPPY
Jamie

SHERIFF THACKER
Bring forth the evidence

One of the white hoods moves forward and brings out the
letter and the photograph from Resl Both Jamie and Ronsel
see it and sink The white hood hands it to Pappy

SHERIFF THACKER (CONT’D)
You know why you’re here nigger
(off Ronsel’s silence)
I asked you a question

Ronsel stays silent Sheriff throws a nod to Orris who walks
over to Ronsel and slugs him with a left and then a right to
the ribs The thuds from the blows force grunts from Ronsel

Jamie winces But Ronsel stays as cool He will not show

them his fear

Pappy walks up to Ronsel and shows him the letter and the
picture of Resl and Franz Ronsel eyes the photo

SHERIFF THACKER (CONT’D)
Did you rut with this woman

PAPPY
We know you did it nigger We
just want to hear you say it

The white hood holding the rope jerks it

STOKES
Go on Say it

JAMIE
What the hell do you fellows care
about some Kraut whore

STOKES
Shut your mouth nigger lover

PAPPY
You knew about it Found the
letter in the truck after you gave
him a ride

JAMIE
Those Fraulein cunts got a lot of
our boys killed If Ronsel here
left her with a little half-breed
bundle of joy to remind her of it
I call it justice

Jamies logic lands for a moment and there’s hope

SHERIFF THACKER
Oh youre good pretty boy Too
bad you’re full of shit

JAMIE
How do you even know that Ronsel
here is the father

PAPPY
Says so right there in the letter

JAMIE
That doesn’t mean a damn thing

STOKES
Well let’s ask him why don’t we
(to Ronsel re the photo)
Are you the father of this I won’t
call it a child this
abomination

SHERIFF THACKER
Answer him

The noose tightens Ronsel won’t deny his own son and he
manages to choke out the word

RONSEL
Yes

SHERIFF THACKER
Leviticus 1919 “Ye shall keep my
statutes Thou shalt not let thy
cattle gender with a diverse kind
Thou shalt not sow thy field with
mingled seed” The penalty for
abomination is death

JAMIE
Have you all lost your damn minds
Killing a decorated soldier over an
enemy whore The man fought for
Patton for Godsakes --

STOKES
That’s enough --

JAMIE
You turn him loose now and maybe I
won’t go to the law Otherwise I
swear you better kill us both

Stokes can’t believe the nerve of Jamie and he moves towards
him with the gun

PAPPY
You gonna betray your own blood
over a nigger

Pappy tries to stand between Stokes and Jamie but Jamie
shoves him out of the way Stokes points the gun at Jamie
Jamie steps up and puts the gun barrel to his own forehead

JAMIE
Do it Go on
105A

The entire room hangs on the tension for a long beat Then
quick as a cat Jamie swipes the gun with one hand and
PUNCHES Stokes in the mouth with the other Stokes’s head
snaps back and he stumbles backwards and falls Jamie
quickly turns to Dex who has the shotgun

JAMIE (CONTD)
Drop it Dex
Dex hesitates and Jamie cocks the hammer

JAMIE (CONTD)

DROP IT

PAPPY
He’s bluffing And half drunk
besides

JAMIE

Shut up old man

PAPPY
Point the gun at the nigger

Pappy moves right into Jamie’s eye line blocking his shot

PAPPY (CONT’D)

He won’t shoot He don’t have the
balls to kill a man up close Do
you son

Dex points the shotgun at Ronsel Pappy steps closer to
Jamie

JAMIE
Stop right there I’m warning you

PAPPY
You not gon’ kill your Pappy

Then one of the white hoods charges at Jamie Jamie turns
and shoots him in the leg But that was enough to give the
others a chance to rush in

Jamie squeezes off another shot that misses before he gets
tackled In the subsequent melee they somehow manage to
wrest the gun from Jamie’s hands

But Jamie punches kicks and gives everything he’s got
fighting like a cornered animal But soon they overwhelm
him And they proceed to beat the shit out of him

Jamie and Ronsel lock eyes for a moment during the beating
Then a kick to the head from Stokes

CUT TO BLACK

PAPPY’S VOICE FADES IN echo-y and distant

PAPPY (VO)
Wake up Jamie Wake up dammit

SMASH CUT TO
INT THE SAW MILL - NIGHT

Jamie is awakened by a bucket of cold rain water He is
bruised blurry and dazed But as focus restores he sees a
mass of white hoods staring down at him

Among the hoods is Pappy’s face Jamie recoils and tries to
push him away but his hands are tied behind his back Pappy
yanks him upright and props him against the wall Jamie sees
that Ronsel now hangs from a cross-beam naked and bloodied

PAPPY
You make one more wrong move these
boys are liable to kill you

STOKES
(re Jamie)
What do we do with him

PAPPY
I told you already He won’t talk
Aint that right son

JAMIE
(re Ronsel)
Just let him go

STOKES
You ain’t exactly in a position to
make demands

PAPPY
He won’t go to the law Not if we
make him a part of it

SHERIFF THACKER
How

PAPPY
Nigger still needs to be punished
You let my son there decide how

SHERIFF THACKER
(after a beat)
Alright then What’1l it be

JAMIE
I won’t do it
PAPPY
You don’t want him killed Then
decide his punishment

JAMIE
No

Stokes unsheathes a HUNTING KNIFE

STOKES
You will Or I will

Dex moves to Ronsel and puts the shotgun to Ronsel’s head

SHERIFF THACKER
Ill give you a choice His eyes
His tongue Or his balls Choose
(off Jamie’s silence)
Choose godammit

JAMIE
No

STOKES
Dex --

JAMIE

Alright Alright
Jamie locks eyes with Ronsel This is an impossible choice

SHERIFF THACKER
Which is it boy

Jamies head drops and he mumbles something

DOC TURPIN
Speak up

As Turpin leans in the RISING MUSIC and the SOUNDS OF THE
STORM OUTSIDE TAKE OVER

Then in a SERIES OF FLASHES

--Jamie says something to the Sheriff that we cannot hear
--Stokes turns towards Ronsel with the knife

--White hoods hold a struggling Ronsel

--Stokes grabs Ronsel by the face and forces his mouth open

--Jamie can’t look and he averts his eyes

--Ronsel’s strange muffled screams

--Stokes slices and BLOOD spurts from Ronsel’s mouth and
stains some of the white robes around him

SMASH TO BLACK

Jamie is thrown onto his bed wet beaten and unconscious
Pappy and Orris Stokes glower above him Stokes drifts out

Pappy frozen staring at Jamie He removes his son’s boots
Throws a horse blanket over him Jamie sputters in his sleep
A confusion of feelings mottle Pappy’s face

Driving rain and howling wind outside Pappy sleeps
peacefully his breathing deep and steady A LIGHTNING FLASH
accompanied by THUNDER briefly ILLUMINATES the room

Several beats then more THUNDER and LIGHTNING and we see
Jamie standing by Pappy’s bedside He stares at Pappy as he
clinches the pillow in his hands Then finally he shakes
Pappy violently

JAMIE
Wake up

Pappy jerks awake and squints up at Jamie

PAPPY
The hell are you doing boy

JAMIE
I wanted to make sure I looked you
in the eye

With that Jamie shoves the pillow onto Pappy’s face Pappy
thrashes and claws Jamie presses harder Then soon the
thrashing weakens Pappy’s leg kicks become twitches and his
hands loose from Jamie’s And then Pappy is still Jamie
holds the pillow there for several more beats Then slowly
he pulls it from Pappy’s face Pappy’s eyes are wide and his
mouth agape

Where Laura KNOCKS on the door

No answer Perplexed she pushes the door open and enters
She reacts when she sees Pappy eyes wide open lifeless and
frozen in shock Then she reaches out touches his skin and
quickly recoils from the cold

She scans Jamie’s empty bed Something on the floor catches
her eye She reaches down and picks it up It’s Pappy’s
white hood Laura holds it up and sees the eye holes and
realizes

JAMIE (0S)
It’s exactly what you think it is

Laura sees Jamie sitting in the corner clutching the pillow
he smothered Pappy with She reacts to his beat up face

LAURA
What happened to you

What happened Jamie Jamie

Jamie reaches into a pocket and fishes out the crumpled photo
of Resl and Ronsel’s son Laura looks at it confused

need to get this coffin in

Hap pulls his arm away and steps down Florence spits over
the side of the wagon and glares at the McAllans

HENRY (CONTD)
Thank you for stopping

Hap takes an end of the rope Henry eyes Marlon

HENRY (CONTD)
Maybe he can help too
HAP
My son is not getting down outta
that wagon

Henry swallows this

HENRY
Okay

Henry takes two end of the rope Hap and Jamie each take one
and they maneuver the coffin down into the hole The coffin
touches bottom and they pull the ropes back up Henry stares
down at the coffin for a beat then

HENRY (CONTD)
We forgot to bring a bible

Hap looks to the sky and cocks his head like he’s listening
to something Then he bows it and pulls a small tattered
bible from inside his jacket

HAP
Done this plenty of times

HENRY
Thank you Hap But no

LAURA
If he’s willing to we should allow
it He is a man of God

JAMIE
I say we let him

HENRY
(after a begrudging beat)
Go on then

Hap flips to a certain page as they all bow their heads A
beat then Hap closes the Bible and quotes from memory His
voice is strong and ringing He’s not trying to comfort the
bereaved He’s sending Pappy to Hell

HAP
Man who is born of a woman is of
few days and full of trouble He
cometh forth like a flower and is
cut down he fleeth as a shadow
and continueth not And dost thou
open thine eyes upon such a one
and bringest me into judgment with
thee Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean Not one

Henry frowns not appreciating the tone or content of the
sermon Laura holds his hand Jamie looks up

HAP (CONTD)
For there is hope of a tree if it
be cut down that it will sprout
again Through the scent of water
it will bud like a plant But man
dieth and wasteth away As the
waters fail from the sea and drieth
up so man lieth down and riseth
not Till the heavens be no more
they shall not awake nor be raised
out of their sleep Amen

LAURA
Amen

JAMIE
Amen

Henry is silent His head still down he starts shovelling
angry mounds of dirt onto the grave Hap tips his hat and
makes for the wagon

Jamie moves to where the tarp hangs He can’t see inside
but he knows who’s in there

look Jamie’s eyes well up with guilt Hap manages a
