A YOUNG BOY maybe 8 helps a NUN wash clothes She hangs
them on the lines as the hot LOS ANGELES sun beats down

floating SPACE HABITAT A torus Bigger than the moon but the
same effect against the blue sky

different to me

She looks over at the Little boy for a moment then goes back
to hanging the laundry as we CUT TO--

We see the TORUS as it sparkles in all of its glory We fly
over millions of mansions covering the inner habitable side
of the torus as it spins slowly in the sunlight

only difference They are rich

that Earth was too dirty for them
and they wanted a new place to
live so they built Blysium

starving A flying machine heads toward the mob

It slows and hovers overhead The airborne vehicle is mostly
blue and has a UN peacekeeper vibe ELYSIUM FOOD PROGRAM
written on the side Max keeps walking alongside the mob

The rear bay decors open on the flying vessel and a robotic
DROID presses a release button on the cargo controls

Food aid bags begin ejecting out of the jet The huge grain
bags fall to the dusty ground People fight over the food

down on the humans Max watches as the jet seals up and flies
away while the starving people fight fiercely over scraps

looking GANGSTERS Each of them is scanned The robots pat
the suspects down fairly violently

leans back throwing a football up toward the roof and

She doesn’t look at him Max glances over at Crowe who
stares back getting uneasy in the Zero G

MATILDA
Mommy I’m scared

FREY
Don’t worry everything’s going to
be fine I promise
She slowly looks up at Max Their eyes meet He looks away

He grips the grenade so hard his tendons flex

He looks around the craft And his eyes slow on warning
legos warning pressurised hull’

Max looks out the porthole at the vacuum of space He sees
ELYSIUM coming into focus Frey looks at him Hard bitter

FREY (CONTD)

Le

He says nothing Deeply conflicted

Suddenly the jet hits the atmosphere of Elysium Shaking and
reverberating through the whole ship Matilda starts CRYING

FREY (CONT’D)
Its ok sweetie It’s alright

Kruger goes and sits dangerously close to Matilda

KRUGER
Tt’s just called reentry Were

Max looks out his window The ship slows rows of gorgeous
mansions extend forever His dream right there

He looks back at Frey Matilda The child terrified tears on
Freys cheeks Max blinks hard makes an impossible decision

MAX

He reels back and tosses the GRENADE all the Way up to the
cockpit It clinks and rolis up to Drake

screaming but she’s held by her harness Max hangs onto
Matilda for dear life as the impact sends everything flying
EXT ELYSTUM

grass hundreds of feet in the air

Martini sipping ELYSIAN women scream and PANIC jumping cut
of their hot tub as the ship tears through their garden

massive warning FOREIGN VESSEL IMPACT BETA QUADRANT

Rhodes abruptly stands and grabs her coat

Max looks around the sparking smoked-up interior He sees
Crowe beginning to stir

Max goes to Frey tries to get her out of the harness but-
it wont budge He runs over to a console of switches and
buttons at the back and hits them one after the next
accidentally the rear BAY DOORS hydraulically hiss open

Sunlight spills into the smoke-filled interior along with
ash and embers Fire from the jet fuel burns outside

As Max tries to find the button to release Frey Crowe begins

to rise Max looks over at him he looks back at Frey and
violently tries to rip the harness open It won’t budge

into a bracket connected to his chest armor

Max dives and grabs the DEFLECTOR off a weapons rack
Drake’s finger on the trigger CLICK
Max’s finger on the Deflector CLICK

at Max the deafening gun filling the interior with smoke

ULTRA SLOW MO the bullets hit the force-field around Max and
deflect in all directions knocking Max violently back Crowe
xeeps firing walking toward Max never letting up

CROWE
Die peasant

Most of the barrage of lead is sent out of the Raven tearing
up the lawn sending plumes of dirt up

EXT RAVEN
The force of the bullets knocks Max cut of the RAVEN onto the
dirt and the metal subsurface of Elysium exposed by the

crash

Despite the violence as soon as Max makes contact with
Elysium’s surface the mainframe becomes aware of him

HOLOGRAPHIC icons and data popup all around Max “deal on
HUGO BOSS” “amazon account - not registered” etc

Max falls on his back the deflector is knocked out of his
hand the force-field goes away Max moves like a lightning
bolt toward Crowe grabbing the huge gun while the psycho
continues firing Max uses his superior HULC strength and
smashes the gun in two over his titanium covered knee

With awesome martial arts moves Max grabs Crowe’s arm pops
his elbow Crowe howls in pain Icons and data pop up
showing directions to the closest medical bay

Max reaches over to Crowe’s tactical webbing pulls the pin
out of a GRENADE and kicks him back onto the lawn

Max moves back inside to help FREY BOQOOOOOM A cloud of
blood dirt and grass is hurled into the air behind Max

INT RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Kruger stumbles up very unsure on his feet Frey looks at
him trembles with fear He slowly pulls two throwing knives

KRUGER
The pain isn’t real

EAT ELYSIUM

Kruger huris the throwing knives with cobra-like snaps But
Max moves so fast that he deflects the blades in the air

MAX
Cmon You can do better

Kruger throws a barrage of four Max smacks three out of the
air one digs into his stomach he stumbles backwards

in the second it takes Max to pull the blade from his
stomach Kruger draws his KATANA and comes at Max full force

He swings his sword like a drunken pro Max uses the exosuit
on his wrists and shins as steel shields

KLINK KLINK Kruger’s sword is stopped by Maxs augmented
limbs But the sheer aggressive onslaught is too much
finally knocking Max back to the ground

The maniac stands over Max puts a boot on his chest
KRUGER
I’m going to enjey this I’m going
to hand deliver them your head
Kruger slowly raises the KATANA Maxs fingers outstretched

feeling for anything he feels the tactical webbing of the
remains of Crowe and then his fingers find Crowes SHOTGUN

As Kruger brings the blade down with bullet-like speed Max
grabs the shotgun and uses it as a shield

ULTRA SLOW MO the KATANA shatters like glass glinting
pieces of titanium fracturing and splintering into the
sunlight Twinkling in front of Max’s face

Max spins up and KICKS Kruger so hard the kick PLINGS Kruger
back against the Raven like a rag doll The coughing wheezing
maniac drops the remains of his sword trying to breathe
INT RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Frey watches as the violence unfolds just outside the ship
Max swings the shotgun up cocks it and steps right up to
Kruger who is now lying propped up against the Raven door
Max puts the shotgun in Kruger’s face

Kruger smiles and licks the barrel of the shotgun
CLOSE UP Max’s trigger finger CLICK

The shotgun pellets BLOW Kruger’s face off

slumps down Max moves toward her but she pushes past him

Matilda races out of the bushes rushes up to her mom Frey
drops down and hugs her little girl tighter than ever

Max turns to the rack of guns in the RAVEN and grabs a
RAILGUN He sees a MEDPACK on the ammo shelf and grabs it

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

He runs over to FREY about to pull the two girls to safaty ed
when he realizes the beauty and scale of BLYSIUM

Frey rises slowly holding Matilda The three egarthlings take
a moment They have never seen anything like this before The
stunning torus creates a horizon that never ends

But Max hears something He snaps his head over to see a
HOMELAND DEFENSE RAVEN incoming

MAX

Spider turns to see the security droids and politicians have
arrived at the end of the GANTRY

Max gets up and stumbles toward the MEDBAY Spider SHUTS the
security door behind them as they leave the gantry He MELTS
the control circuit sealing it

Max stumbles over to a MEDBAY and leans against the machine
His fingers caress the “DIAGNOSE” and “HEAL” buttons

We hear the sound of cutting metal Spider locks up to see
CCB DROIDS cutting through the security door

Max blinks hard He wipes his face and turns away from the
machine He lcoks back at the droids He limps toward Spider

MAX (CONTD)

He motions to the final airlock before the PROTOCOL ROOM He
steps away from the MED BAY he has made his decision

She is fighting back tears She sees the Immigration Droids
coming across the LAWN She leans over and pulls Matilda
closer But doesnt leave the monitor

INT PROTOCOL ROOM

Spider walks over to the central console and takes out his
little computer he plugs his USB wire into the PROTOCOL He
gives the other end to Max Max clumsily plugs it into his
own head He calmly looks back down at Earth He remembers
the locket on his neck He snaps it off holding it

it for a moment And then continues to play with Matilda
