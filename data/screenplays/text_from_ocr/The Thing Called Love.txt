FADE IN
INT APARTMENT - DAY

A small New York City apartment sparsely furnished MIRANDA
PRESLEY 21 sits on the floor amid moving boxes and suitcases
packing to move

out Shes sorting through a stack of old record albums looking
through them as she

piles them in a box We catch sight of some relics from the disco
era as well as several

classic country albums - Donny Osmond and the Saturday Night
Fever soundtrack

mixed in with Patsy Cline and Hank Williams and Elvis After a
brief look she piles

them in a box and closes the lid She looks outside her window
and sees the sun

coming up shes been up all night

Miranda goes over to the window and opens it Its barely light
out but already the

sound of someones radio filters in We hear a car alarm going off
in the distance

Miranda drags a large full trash bag over to the window looks
down and heaves it

out

EXT MIRANDAS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The trash bag falls from a fifth-floor window and into a dumpster
overflowing with
about ten huge trash bags Mirandas thrown out a lot of stuff
The garbage truck
arrives just as the bag lands in the dumpster

EXT MIRANDAS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The suns all the way up now Its a bright June morning Two
teenage boys sit on the

stoop next to Mirandas building They have a boom box and we
hear loud street

music Miranda comes out of her building carrying a moving box
She wears Levis cut

off mid-thigh sneakers and a black leather jacket over a white y-
shirt She carries the

box down the front steps and drops it on a pile on the sidewalk in
front of a waiting cab

The cab driver just leans against his car watching her work

MIRANDA

You know what would be great If you
could just stand there watching me carry
all these boxes out by myself Dont
carry out any yourself dont hold the
door for me and whatever you do dont
put them in your cab And if you could

possible start the meter running now

She leans over and peers into the cab The meters running

smiles at the cab
driver who doesnt seem to understand English

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Perfect Good job Thank you

She gives him a thumbs up He smiles and gives her one back

She goes back for
another box

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
We see the cab parked in from of a luxury high-rise apartment
building The cab driver

leans again the car waiting

INT ELLEN DALYS APARTMENT - DAY

She

A large expensively furnished apartment Mirandas boxes are

piled in the hallway

ELLEN DALY 43 and immaculately dressed socialite looks with

mild distaste at the
boxes cluttering her hallway

ELLEN

I just never imagined there would be this much Miranda

Miranda stands in the living room looking at pictures of Ellen and

a family that doesnt

include Miranda - a respectable clean-cut husband and two perfect

little boys There is

one small picture of Miranda she looks like shes still in high

school

MIRANDA
You should see how much I threw out
Ellen walks in and sits on the couch She sits formally she

doesnt exactly radiate
warmth Miranda turns away from the photos

MIRANDA (CONTD)
You can ship them to me as soon as I get
an apartment

ELLEN
Maybe I should keep them in storage until
you come back

MIRANDA
Im not coming back

Ellen looks at her like she doesnt believe her but shell go
along

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Mom I told you Im moving

Ellen occupies her hands by compulsively straightening the books on
her coffee table
which were already pretty straight

ELLEN

Saying youre going to do something and
actually doing it are two entirely
d

ifferent things I hate to see you give
up everything to go and pursue this

fantasy you have about being a country
singer Have you taken a moment to stop

and look at your behavior

MIRANDA
I1l1 do it on the bus OK

Ellen assumes the role of the voice of reason

ELLEN

I know you father made Nashville sound
very romantic I wish he were here now to
see you acting this way He could tell
you how difficult it is

MIRANDA
Thats not what hed tell me
(sadly remembering)
Daddy would tell me I can anything in
the world

ELLEN

Yes he probably would but in the real
world the chances of making it are a
million to one

MIRANDA

How can I pass up a one in a million
opportunity

She smiles Ellen doesnt

MIRANDA (CONTD)

I dont expect you to understand why I
have to do this I just want you to send
me my stuff

ELLEN
I really think you should think about this
for a few days

MIRANDA

(determined)

Ive been thinking about it my whole life
Its time for me to do it

Mirandas saying this more for her own benefit her mother doesnt
seem to be listening

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I have to go My cab is waiting

She goes to her mother and kisses her on the cheek

APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Miranda comes out of the building and crosses the sidewalk to the
cab She talks to the

driver not expecting him to understand

MIRANDA
My mother thinks she can control my life

Surprisingly the driver speaks with a heavy foreign accent
DRIVER
She stills sees you as a little girl

Miranda looks only mildly surprised that the driver has understood
everything she has

said She gets in the cab

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

We hear a simple country ballad A Greyhound bus travels through
the mountains

INT BUS - DAY

Miranda sits in a window seat asleep resting her head against
her jacket

INT BUS - NIGHT

Mirandas in the same seat awake now staring out the window into
the darkness

EXT TRUCK STOP - DAY

The bus is making a rest stop (We see that the destination sign
reads Nashville)
Passengers walk around stretching their legs Miranda leans

against a wall checking
her watch impatient

INT NASHVILLE GREYHOUND STATION - DAY

We still hear the country music Miranda comes into the terminal
carrying a huge

suitcase and a guitar She squints at the light reaches into her
jacket pocket pulls out

her sunglasses and puts them on She looks around Aman ina
cowboy hat sits ona

bench He gives Miranda a friendly smile and an almost tip of the
hat She looks at

him like shes trying to figure out what species he is and drags
her stuff outside

EXT GREYHOUND STATION - DAY

Miranda looks around and spots a taxi across the street She puts
her index and middle
fingers inside her mouth of whistles Everyone within earshot

turns and looks at her
The taxi driver looks up from his newspaper

INT LUCYS CAF - DAY
A young man takes the stage sits on the stool and begins singing

a mediocre country
ballad slightly out of tune

EXT LUCYS CAF - DAY

Miranda carrying her guitar in one hand and her suitcase in the
other gets out of the

cab and heads for the entrance of Lucys

At the same time JAMES WYNN 23 gets out of his pick-up truck in
Lucys parking

lot James is good-looking in a somewhat dangerous way He
picks up his guitar case

and strides over to Lucys getting there just before Miranda He
tries the door Its

locked

MIRANDA

James looks at her the way shes dressed the huge suitcase she
carries He looks
amused

INT LUCYS CAF - DAY

Another young songwriter auditions This one plays the fiddle and
has a friend backing

him up on guitar Hes energetic but the song isnt very good
Lucy sits in the back of the crowded room She reveals no

expression as she watches

the songwriter but we see her head shake no slightly as she
makes a notation on his
application and places it in what is presumably the reject pile

EXT LUCYS CAF - DAY

Miranda sits on the sidewalk outside the caf James locks her
suitcase in his truck and
comes and sits down next to her

MIRANDA

INT LUCYS CAF - DAY

Onstage a woman with teased blond hair fringed cowboy shirt
and matching white

cowboy hat and boots stands with her guitar dancing around as
she sings off-key

EXT LUCYS CAF - DAY

Miranda knocks quietly on the door No answer She knocks a
little louder The

door opens She gives James a look A face appears from inside
it belongs to

LINDA LUE LINDEN 20 a sweetly attractive Southern belle She

puts her finger to
her lips and lets them in

The blond woman finishes and steps off the stage Lucy calls out
the next name

LUCY
Nick Reynolds

NICK REYNOLDS early 30s gets up to and goes to the stage

sit down with Linda Lue at a table near the door Linda Lue finds
some blank

applications on the next table and hands them to James and Miranda

company logo He sits
at the microphone and addresses the room

NICK

Hi Im Nick Reynolds Im from Memphis
originally This ones called Shoot me
up run me down take me back and its
dedicated to you Lucy

Lucy seems unmoved by the sentiment A few auditioners smile

knowingly Nick

starts to play He seemed like a pretty soft-spoken guy up till
now but he was

apparently saving his personality for his performance The song

is humorous about
cartoonishly extreme devotions to a woman who wont pay him any

attention Nicks
fellow musicians are a good audience laughing in the appropriate
places

Lucy doesnt laugh at the song she matter-of-factly moves Nicks
application into the

yes® pile

Her song is cute

good either

KYLE

(laughs nervously)

Im a little nervous but it doesnt
really show

Kyle clears his throat and stares at the floor

KYLE (CONTD)
This song is called Blue and Blue

Kyle seems to be more than just a little nervous he barely
manages to raise his head

high enough to sing into the mike He sings without confidence
his voice cracking

The songs sounds like it might actually be good if he wasnt
butchering it Lucy stares

at Kyle deep in thought holding his application Miranda watches
him too listening

closely to his song

CUT TO

Lucys down to the last two applications She calls James name
out an edge in her
voice

LUCY

JAMES (CONTD)
Howdy James Wynn from Austin Texas I

and hes a charismatic

performer His song is great too (a ballad eg iIt Only Hurts

LUCY
Miranda Presley looks like you get to be

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

James and Miranda stand next to his truck He opens the passenger
door and takes out
her suitcase He sets it on the ground She looks disappointed

she doesnt know
where shes going to go now

JAMES
You want a lift somewhere

MIRANDA

Why I would be much obliges if you would
convey me in this Glen Campbell Hee-Haw
pick-up truck
James picks up the suitcase and tosses it in the back of the truck

JAMES

Just so you know Im not taking this
personally these little jabs and put-
downs about what a yee-haw hillbilly town
you have landed your cosmopolitan self in
Where are you staying

MIRANDA
I havent decided

Miranda sees Linda Lue crossing the parking lot next to her car and
calls to her

MIRANDA
Linda Lue Linden

Linda Lue turns around She looks pleased to be noticed and
comes over

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Thanks for sneaking us in

LINDA LUE
Oh youre welcome I dont normally
flaunt the rules but my little voice told
me I should open that door And I do
believe it was right

(to James)
You were real good You got a lot of

presence up there Some people they sing
real good but they got no presence you
know

JAMES
Thanks

One of the singers approaches his truck is parked next to James
We recognize him as

Kyle the one with stage fright He notices James
KYLE

They shake hands

KYLE (CONTD)

JAMES
(nods)

MIRANDA
(to Kyle)
Did you make it

He seems a little startled by her directness

KYLE
No

MIRANDA
Too bad I liked your song

He looks at her skeptically is she making fun of him

KYLE
Yeah I liked yours too Always have

She laughs then starts to sing Kyles song a cappella If we
didnt know it before we

now know its a beautiful song She sings just the first verse
and stops Kyle stares at

her drawn into her singing hearing his song the way it should
be Even after she

stops he stares at her Finally he grins

KYLE

Thats it exactly How did you know that

Miranda doesnt see what hes so excited about

MIRANDA
All I did was sing it on key

KYLE
Are you going to Reds A bunch of us are
going to Reds For a beer

Kyle looks like its important to him that she goes

LINDA LUE
That sounds like fun
MIRANDA
(to James)
Are you going

JAMES
Iam

MIRANDA
(to Kyle)
See you there

INT REDS BAR - NIGHT

Miranda James Kyle and Linda Lue sit together at a table We
see quite a few familiar

faces from Lucys audition at surrounding tables Everyone has a
bottle of beer except

for Linda Lue who drinks a Shirley Temple

MIRANDA

(to Linda Lue)

Dont even tell me you have least
three relatives who have died of
consumption

Linda Lue seems pleased with Mirandas accuracy

LINDA LUE

Well its four if you count Eddie He
was my mothers second cousin on her
mothers side He was found at the bottom
of my inflatable play pool I found him
actually

KYLE

(Whispering to James)
The bottom of the pool

Linda Lue goes on cheerfully oblivious of the stunned reaction
LINDA LUE
I noticed you have your suitcase Do you

have a place to stay

Miranda just looks at her
LINDA LUE (CONT®D)
I have a real cute motel room with two

beds Theres even a pool shaped like a
guitar We could share it

JAMES
(To Miranda pointedly)
She has a pool

MIRANDA
Youve known me fifteen minutes and you
want me to move in I could be a serial

killer for all you know

LINDA LUE
Oh I can see that youre not Im an
excellent judge of character Ive got a

touch of the power

Miranda doesnt want to ask what the power is

KYLE
My grandmother can tell when a tornado is
coming a week in advance

Linda Lue nods she knows exactly what he means

LINDA LUE
Some things are beyond our comprehension
(to Kyle)

Let me see your palm

He gives it to her

LINDA LUE (CONTD)
Now you you got a real strong heart line
see it here

KYLE
Is that good

LINDA LUE
Well sure but it can also be a little
dangerous My cousin Lester he hada

similar heart line and he threw himself
in front of a speeding train in the name
of love
Miranda smirks

MIRANDA
My cousin Leon did the very same thing

LINDA LUE

Isnt that a coincidence You want me to
do yours

Linda Lue reaches for Mirandas hand Miranda drops the parasol
and lets her have it

MIRANDA
If Im going to meet with a bizarre

premature death Id just as soon not know
about it

Linda Lue looks up from Mirandas palm and answers her gravely

LINDA LUE
All right

(looking at Mirandas hand)
Oh well I envy you this life line
Youre going to make your mark People
will remember you when youre gone

Miranda pulls her hand back

LINDA LUE (CONTD)

Im not saying itll be soon Dont you
want me to read your heart line

Miranda doesnt offer her hand

MIRANDA
No Thanks

JAMES
Hey let me see your heart line

Miranda holds out her hand James pretends to examine it

JAMES (CONTD)
You will remain unmarried until the age of
60 at which time you will wed a series
of men with one common characteristic

MIRANDA
Namely

He squints at her palm

JAMES
They will all be named Bubba Sometimes
it will be a nickname or a middle name

Miranda carefully extracts her hand from James He looks at her
suggestively as if

shes fighting the impulse to jump him She answers with a get
real look

The music on the jukebox has stopped Miranda reaches for her
guitar She starts to

play a song James watches her hears the opening chords and
reaches for his guitar

James starts playing the same song as Miranda I dont know why
you dont want
me Miranda begins to sing

MIRANDA

(singing)
Its the right time and though I feel
fine tonight

JAMES
(singing)
I dont know why you dont want me

MIRANDA

(singing)
Its the right place Ive got the new
face tonight

JAMES
(singing)
I dont know why you dont want me

Kyle and Linda Lue join in Soon the other hopefuls from the
audition are singing
along commiserating abut their rejection
INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Linda Lue has apparently had a hand in the decorating of this room
its hard to believe

the motel provided matching floral chintz drapes bedspreads and
pillows or a framed

photo of Loretta Lynn Linda Lues dog of the tiny furry white
variety sits on his

own floral pillow Miranda throws her suitcase on one of the beds

LINDA LUE

You can have either bed Ive been using
this one

She points to the one Miranda has not chosen

LINDA LUE (CONTD)
but you can take whichever you want

Miranda leaves her suitcase where it is and looks around There
are several stacks of

Bibles in the room She lifts the cover of one verifying what
it is and decides not to

deal with this information

MIRANDA
Is this the extra the Loretta Lynn suite

She flops down on the bed her eyes closed Linda Lues dog
comes over and sniffs
Miranda then settles in next to her Miranda opens her eyes
sees the dog and closes
them again The phone rings Linda Lue picks it up
LINDA LUE
(into phone)
Hello Hi Mama Well I just got in
this second Mama Things are real
good

Linda Lue sits up straight her right hand flat on her bed
Without looking down she

crosses her fingers first on her right hand then on her left
the one holding the phone

LINDA LUE (CONTD)
Uh-huh
(brightly)
I passed my audition

Mirandas eyes open she tilts her head back and looks at Linda
Lue upside down

Shes surprised at the lie but then again she really doesnt
give a shit Miranda gets

up and opens her suitcase She takes out a pair of jeans

LINDA LUE (CONTD)

Well I was waiting for you take a
breath Mama so I could get a word in
Yeah just like Loretta

Linda Lue rolls her eyes at Miranda whos changing into the jeans

LINDA LUE (CONTD)
Only prettier

Miranda smiles She pulls a black leather-bound notebook out of
her suitcase and picks
up her guitar Linda Lue covers the mouthpiece with her hand

LINDA LUE (CONTD)
Are you going somewhere

MIRANDA

Im just going to go to that coffee shop
across the street

She takes her motel room key off the table and puts it on a chain
around her neck next
to several other keys and a locket

LINDA LUE

But its late Dont you want to go to

and furry bedroom

slippers Her hair is pulled back with a pink band She looks
like an exceptionally tall
five-year-old She spots Miranda and pads over to her table

Miranda looks at her and
puts down her paper

LINDA LUE
Did I remember to give the spare room

MIRANDA

LINDA LUE

Miranda glances down at Linda Lues foot which sticks out from
under the table

MIRANDA
(noticing)

Your pajamas have feet

Linda Lue waits for an answer

MIRANDA (CONTD)

Look I came here to be alone Nothing
personal
Linda Lue looks hurt Miranda smiles at her kindly

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Nothing personal I swear Cross my
heart

Linda Lue draws herself up and speaks with conviction

LINDA LUE

Some people arent exactly the people you
they are when you first meet
someone

She gets up and pads out of the coffee shop Miranda watcher her
go

INT COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

KYLE
I just saw Linda Lue She said youd be

He looks at the dog who continues a low growl

MIRANDA
Thanks Let me know if she says anything else

She starts to close the door

KYLE

She open the door again The dog steps up the growl

KYLE (CONTD)

She closes the door The dog stops growling
EXT APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF - DUSK

Kyle and Miranda sit in beach chairs on the roof of his apartment
building with their

guitars Theres a grill next to Kyle hes barbequeing
something for dinner

Kyles finishing up a song a beautiful ballad (eg Keep me

from blowing away)
His voice is tentative and he watches his fingers as he plays

MIRANDA

All right Now start the song again but
instead of singing tell me about your
guitar

Kyle starts to strum the chords to the song

KYLE
What do you want to know about it

MIRANDA

I dont know some kind of amusing
anecdote about how your daddy traded a pig
for it or the ghost of Hank Williams Sr
Left it on your front porch

Kyle has started to watch his fingers again He looks up
decides not to let her get to

him

KYLE

My mom gave me this guitar She said she
could tell I had a lot of creative energy

MIRANDA
What about your dad

KYLE
I dont know what about him

MIRANDA
Anything Keep playing

KYLE

The first time I came to Nashville I was

here four months before I ran out of money
and had to turn around and come back home

I thought hed want me to give it up

since I hadnt made it But he just put
me back to work on the ranch Said he
could use me until I was ready to give it
another go

MIRANDA
Letting life teach you its own lessons

realizing your dreams werent the same as
his dreams

Kyle laughs

KYLE

Stop me if youve heard my life story
before

MIRANDA

I saw that episode of Gunsmoke Anyway
the important thing is youre playing the
guitar without looking at your fingers

He stops playing

KYLE
Of course I dont have to watch my
fingers Its part of my style

MIRANDA
Well dont do it anymore Now look at
me and sing some of the words

Kyle starts to play again looking Miranda in the eye He stops
and starts the song

over He opens his mouth then shuts it again Finally he
stops playing

KYLE
I cant do it
MIRANDA
Why not

KYLE

Its personal Its part of me You and
me here alone my singing to you is
practically like stripping down naked

Miranda raises her eyebrows as if he might actually disrobe

KYLE (CONTD)
Isnt it like that for you singing one of
your songs

MIRANDA

It seems to me that this is a rather
serious handicap for an aspiring
performer

KYLE

I dont want to be a performer Id have
to be insane to think I could ever make a
dime with this voice

MIRANDA
I thought you wanted to learn to sing

KYLE
I do So I can sing on writers night I

cant get my songs recorded if nobody
hears them

MIRANDA
Is that the only way to get them heard

KYLE
Ive done about a hundred demos me songs
with other singers Vince Gill put a song

of mine on hold last summer was thinking
about putting it on his new album but he

didnt end up cutting it
Miranda picks up her guitar

MIRANDA
Well maybe if you see yourself as an
actor like its not really you Play the
part in the song

She starts to strum a few chords She looks Kyle in the eye
she sings acting as if
the words were meant for him The sun is setting behind her

MIRANDA

(singing)
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
And none of the things you do
Could tear us apart
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
When I gave myself to you
You took only my heart

She puts the guitar down Kyle fell for the act he looks
slightly lovestruck

KYLE
Thats nice You write that
MIRANDA
(shakes her head no)
Lyle Lovett Hes my favorite
KYLE
Youre not proving your point until you
play me one of your songs
He gets up to check on the barbeque

MIRANDA

She smiles at him she doesnt have any songs

KYLE
You havent written any songs

MIRANDA
Youre a songwriter Im a singer

KYLE

MIRANDA
Nobody but me

Kyle shakes his head no

KYLE

Country musics all about the words
having something to say You wouldnt be
here if you didnt have those words inside

Miranda considers the potential truth of this

MIRANDA

Im the one who dropped my entire life and
moved someplace Ive never even visited
before I should get to figure out why
the hell I did it

NICK

(calls to the back room)
Lucy come on out here

Lucy comes out of the back room a look of annoyance on her face
She recognizes
Miranda

LUCY

Well if it isnt Miss Presley What can
I do for you honey

NICK

Shes interested in the waitress position
I told her youd probably want to hire
her

Both women look at Nick like they wish hed butt out The
bartender pages through a
booklet looking for a Shirley Temple recipe
MIRANDA
Look I dont want to be a waitress

LUCY
Then why am I out here

Miranda looks at Nick accusingly

NICK
I dont know but you sure do look nice

LUCY

Nick Ive got a million things to do
Darcy called me at four in the afternoon
to tell me she was quitting

NICK
(mock surprise)
Quitting Why

LUCY

Oh shes going on tour with Rodney
Crowell or some fool thing

NICK
Whats she going to do Drive the bus

Nick knows very well what Darcys going to do

LUCY

(to Miranda)
Darcys a singer She met Rodney Crowell

him a tape which is against the rules
and now shes singing back-up on his tour
Nicks a sucker for a happy ending but

theyre few and far between if you ask
me

Lucy heads for the back room

MIRANDA
Lucy

She turns around

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I just wanted to apologize For singing

Desperadog at the audition I knew I was
supposed to sing something I wrote

LUCY

No apology necessary Just dont pull
that again Youre welcome to try out
anytime with something of your own

(sighs)
And you can have the waitress job if you
decide youre interested by tomorrow

afternoon But no passing tapes to the
customers
Lucy goes into the back room The bartender has finally finished

the Shirley Temple
and Miranda picks up her drinks

MIRDANDA
(to Nick)
You think I should take this job dont
you
NICK

If you think opportunity keeps dropping by
until you like what hes wearing you
might as well pass this up

MIRANDA

Ever since I crossed the border into
Tennessee Its been an exercise in logic
to get a yes or no answer

NICK

Personally I think you should take the
job You got the voice to make it
someday

Miranda is surprised at the flattery but still concerned

MIRANDA
How long did Darcy work here

NICK
You dont want to know

Miranda goes back to her table James is going onstage The
audience applauds
Hes confident poised Two or three musicians assemble behind
him to back him up

JAMES

Hi Im James Wynn Im from Austin
where we like our music with a few rough
edges I hope thats all right with
yall If you like this one maybe you
can tell Lucy let her know Nashvilles
ready for something new for a change

Miranda looks confused She turns to Kyle

KYLE

I heard he wanted Lucky to let him play
without an audition He had all these
reviews from when he played in Austin I
also heard that he shot a record executive
in Austin but I dont think that parts
true

James signals the band and they kick in with an energetic
rockabilly-flavored song

Hes definitely showing he has the talent to back up his attitude
EXT LUCYS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

James leans against his truck drinking a beer talking to the
guys who played behind

him Miranda Linda Lue and Kyle come out of the bar James
says goodnight to the

musicians and calls out to Miranda

JAMES
Miranda Come here

She walks over to him leaving Linda Lue and Kyle waiting for her

MIRANDA
You were good

He reaches out and takes her hand surprising her

MIRANDA
No Did you

Kyles talking to Linda Lue He looks over and sees James holding
Mirandas hand

and stops mid-sentence Linda Lue turns to look and sees Miranda

EXT EMPTY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A large empty bowling alley parking lot Jamess truck travel
in circles tires
squealing

INT TRUCK - NIGHT

Inside the truck we see that Miranda is driving She grinds the
gears and wrestles with
the steering wheel Speed seems to be her only objective

JAMES
I cant believe youve never driven
before

MIRANDA
Im doing that well

JAMES
No I put that wrong I believe you when
you say youve never driven before A

blind man could see youve never driven
before

Miranda gives him a look and drives over a cement parking divider
James gets an idea

JAMES (CONTD)
I know Step on the middle pedal

She hits the brake The car stalls

JAMES (CONTD)
My fault I forgot to remind you about
the clutch

He opens the glove box and pulls out a bandana He holds it up in
front of Miranda

trying to put it on her like a blindfold She looks at him like
hes nuts

MIRANDA
Maybe this works with other girls

JAMES
Trust me

She lets him blindfold her

CUT TO
INT TRUCK - NIGHT
Miranda drives with the blindfold on Shes doing much better

driving in slow circles

James periodically tells her when to turn putting his hand on the
steering wheel to help

her

JAMES
Not too many people know this but
Nashville has a giant magnet - its right
under this very parking lot - that pulls
things in People pick-up trucks old
Roy Orbison eight-tracks It pulled you
here Turn left

She turns to look at him but cant because of the bandana

MIRANDA
Why didnt it pull anybody else I know

JAMES

It doesnt attract everyone Just hicks

and hillbillies and a few rednecks

Songwriters People who own cowboy hats
(CONTD

JAMES (CONTD)

guys with mustaches If you have a
pick-up sometimes itll get pulled with
you in it Some people try to ignore it
they get used to the pull and just never
come My theory about you is that youve
got this stray piece of hillbilly lodged
in you probably in one of your shoulders
You were smart not to fight it

MIRANDA

You know how you can have a job and an
apartment and friends and you think this
is my life If I leave this I have no
life

JAMES
Mmm Turn right

She makes the turn easily not thinking about the driving

MIRANDA
Well I woke up a few weeks ago and it was
really hot out and sunny and there were
kids everywhere It was the first day of
summer vacation and it was just like
every other day to me I wanted to be

out like they were I just wanted out

And I thought nothings holding me here
I can do whatever the hell I want And
if I dont do it now Ill keep going
forever doing what I think I have to do
when actually the only thing thats
definite about my life is that Im in it
Im the fucking lead I left the next
day

JAMES
That happened to me when I was seventeen

MIRANDA
And Ive always wanted to see Graceland

JAMES
How fast are you going

MIRANDA
About twenty

JAMES
Fourteen Shift down and make a sharp
right when I say now Now

Miranda follows his instructions and pulls smoothly onto the
highway

JAMES (CONTD)
Speed up

She does shifting into third

JAMES (CONTD)

Faster Get into fourth

MIRANDA

Fourth I cant go that fast in a parking
lot

JAMES

Promise me you wont panic

He pulls off her blindfold and she sees that shes driving on the
highway She smiles
proud of herself

EXT HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Miranda and James lie on their stomachs in the back of his pick-up
truck looking off
into the distance

MIRANDA
Youve got a strange idea of a good time

JAMES
Its better this way

We see that they are watching a drive-in movie except theyre not
at the drive-in

theyre parked overlooking the drive-in They have a good view of
the screen but no

speaker Its a clear summer night just barely dark out The
movie is lLove Story

JAMES (CONTD)
You can make up your own story

James sits up and reaches for his guitar He starts to strum the
guitar nods in the

direction of the screen and sings the first line of a song making
it up as he goes along

He plays waiting for Miranda to do the second line She doesnt
He keeps making up

lines making the song about the characters in the movie
Suddenly Miranda comes up

with a line of her own its just as good as one of James She
makes up the chorus and

they sing together

Miranda rolls over on her back and stares at the sky her head
flopped out the back of
the truck

MIRANDA
I didnt know there were this many stars

JAMES
Giant magnet Whats your favorite song

Miranda answers without hesitation

MIRANDA
Hooked on a Feeling®

JAMES
Me too
MIRANDA
Liar

JAMES

position as the only person on the planet
whose favorite song is Hooked on a
Feeling®

MIRANDA
Whats yours

JAMES

James laughs

JAMES
What can you do that no one else can do

MIRANDA

song Any Bon Jovi single Except lLay

Your Hands on Me® What about you

JAMES
I speak Spanish

MIRANDA
So do a billion other people

JAMES
Last month I punched a record producer in
the face

MIRANDA
I heard you shot him Only he was a label
executive
JAMES
See you should never believe rumors

MIRANDA
So what happened

JAMES

I met this producer in Austin who wanted
to do some demos with me try and get me a
record deal then as soon as we got into
the studio he started changing my songs

fucking with them so theyd sound more

like everyone else We had a fundamental
difference of opinion And he was a dick
MIRANDA

So you punched him

JAMES
I believe in doing what you feel like
doing at any moment in time

MIRANDA

Whats it like when you sing something
you wrote

JAMES
Dont you write songs

MIRANDA
No I think I might try it though This
singing thing isnt really working out

JAMES

The first time I played one of my songs
and people connected with it it was like
sex Well not exactly Like the first
time you kiss someone and your heart kind
of flips except it doesnt make you feel
weak it makes you feel strong If you
think its something you want to do you
should try it

MIRANDA
I think its something I want to do

They look straight at each other lean towards each other and kiss
EXT LUCYS CAF MALL - DAY

down the sidewalk and goes inside Lucys

INT LUCYS CAF® - NIGHT

indicates that its not what he ordered and makes her take it back
She carries the bottle

back to the bar where Nick sits at his usual post

MIRANDA
Did I thank you for bringing glamour and
excitement into my dreary life

NICK
Did you mess up another one

She slides the bottle over to the bartender

MIRANDA
(to bartender)
Michelob
(to Nick)

EXT MUSIC ROW - NIGHT

Kyle and Miranda come out of the building where they were
recording The walk down

the sidewalk Kyle carrying Mirandas guitar Miranda looks down
not stepping on

MIRANDA
So what are you going to do with the demo

KYLE

They11l put it on a list of available
songs and if someone comes in and wants
something like this they might listen to
it

MIRANDA

Thats it Thats how youre getting it
heard Thats a great song better than
most of the stuff on the radio

KYLE
Two words

MIRANDA
No wonder

She keeps walking Kyle stops

KYLE
No wonder what
She doesnt answer He thinks

KYLE (CONTD)

No wonder I cant get anything recorded

No wonder Il1l be just another guy who
never did what he said he was going to No

wonder I work in a record store Because
I didnt push my songs on every singer I
met

(seems to realize something)
Well I did that for awhile but those
songs werent that good

Miranda stops walking She turns and looks at Kyle

KYLE (CONTD)

For your information I stopped putting
all my energy into every new song because
I didnt want to be so damned disappointed
all the time

Miranda looks guilty She begins an apology
MIRANDA
Kyle
Kyle sits down on the curb Miranda sits next to him
KYLE
(realizing)
Youre right No wonder How can I

expect anyone else to get excited about my
songs if I dont I shouldnt just sit
back and wait for someone to find my
songs I should do something to get my
songs heard

He tries to think of an idea

KYLE (CONTD)
What do you think I should do

Miranda takes the demo tape out of her pocket

MIRANDA
I think you should - we should - take this
song to Wynonna and get her to listen to
it

She stands up Kyle remains sitting She tilts her head - a
gesture for him to come on
then stars walking away

KYLE
What right now

He gets up and follows her
EXT WYNONNA JUDDS HOUSE - NIGHT

Theres a car parked in the circular driveway Kyle and Miranda

MIRANDA

Are you sure this is the right house She
parks right out front Anyone could break

KYLE
I guess were the only ones who thought of
it Its her house I came to a party

here once

MIRANDA

So youre in her social circle but we
have to lurk around at dawn to give her a
tape

KYLE
I was parking cars and this wasnt my
idea

MIRANDA
Give me the thing

Kyle hands her a slim jim
KYLE

The thing I thought you had done this

Kyle puts his hand on her wrist to stop her

KYLE

OK Time to go

MIRANDA

She carefully inserts the slim jim between the car window and the
door She moves it

around expertly and after a few seconds the door lock clicks
Kyle jumps

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Give me the tape

Kyle hands her the tape She opens the car door As soon as she
raises the handle the
car alarm goes off

KYLE

Shit Lets go

MIRANDA

Miranda rolls her eyes at him

MIRANDA

How else is she going to know whose song

KYLE

But shell know I broke into her car

MIRANDA

drawback to the plan

The alarm continues to blare A light comes on inside the house
Kyle looks up and
sees it Miranda follows his gaze and sees it too

MIRANDA
Dont people ignore these things anymore

She gets out of the car Kyle gets in a pushes buttons on the
tape player

KYLE
Wheres the eject

Miranda hears something she looks down the driveway and sees a
police car pulling
up

MIRANDA
And when did the cops start responding so
quickly

angry Miranda leans over
the receiving desk pleasing with an unsympathetic cop

MIRANDA
I told you we werent trying to steal

The cop looks from one to the other he doesnt care whose idea

KYLE
You didnt mention the one drawback

MIRANDA
Any idiot would have figured out the one the one

still ahs and crosses that out too

MIRANDA
And youve never even gone out with him

NICK
(singing)
She wont even give me a chance

Lucy sighs she doesnt think this is nearly as interesting as
Miranda does

LUCY

Miranda looks at her expectantly

NICK
(singing)
She calls me sorry and thats just what I
am
LUCY
I met Nick about eight years ago My

husband and him

MIRANDA
Your husband

Nick starts a new song with a different melody

NICK
(singing)
That no good man wasnt no good for you

LUCY

My husband played guitar in Nicks band
Nick started acting pretty much the way he

acts now only then I was young and didnt
have much sense

NICK (singing)
I wouldnt give you a dollar for all the sense
in the world
LUCY
I eventually left my husband and took up
with him

She jerks her head in Nicks direction

MIRANDA

(singing)
It was the right love at the wrong
time

LUCY

Nick got a record deal He cut an album
and went on tour His first night on the
road he called me up and started talking
about what was it Nick Space
NICK

(singing)
Now it seems all the space in the world
is between me and you

LUCY

Well his album didnt exactly set any
sales records and his record label
dropped him Before I knew it he was

hanging around here thinking I was fool
enough to take him back

NICK

(singing)
You dont want to fool with this fool in
love with you

MIRANDA
Maybe hes learned his lesson

NICK

(singing)
But Ive learned my lesson you taught me
the hard way to fall

LUCY
He hasnt said anything so far to make me
think hes learned one damn thing Im
going to open up
She walks over to unlock the front door

NICK

(singing)
Open up your heart to me darling this
time I wont let you down

LUCY
Get off my stage Nick

around for something

She sees Kyle leaning against his truck Miranda stays where she
is Kyle walks over

to her

She looks at him doubtfully

KYLE (CONTD)

Miranda smiles

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Miranda and Kyle walk along the strip on night clubs and souvenir
shops Its a warm

night and they pass musicians playing on the sidewalk for tips
They pass an open

bottle of champagne back and forth drinking straight out of the
bottle

KYLE
Its lucky for both of us that my song was
so good or wed be in jail right now

MIRANDA
Its lucky for you that I sang on that
demo

KYLE
Hey I can sing pretty good Ill have you

MIRANDA
You1l have to show me that sometime

Kyle walks over to one of the street musicians and borrows his
guitar He leans against

a wall and begins to play Miranda and the musician watch him He
starts to sing its

the love song he did at the auditions the one Miranda sang to him
in the parking lot

Kyle does it a lot better than when he auditioned he looks right a
Miranda and sings the

words to her He finishes showing no signs of embarrassment and
hands the guitar

back to the musician

KYLE
Thanks buddy

He and Miranda walk away

MIRANDA
Not bad

She hands him the champagne bottle

KYLE
Not bad Not bad

MIRANDA
Youre Johnny Cash Youre Vince Gill
Youre George Strait

He puts his arm around her and she leans her head against his
shoulder

KYLE
You know whats funny

Miranda doesnt answer
KYLE (CONTD)

The first time I saw you I didnt even
realize how beautiful you were
She seems affected by this but only for a moment She pulls away

from him

MIRANDA

Just once Id like a sober man to call me
beautiful

KYLE

Its not just that its you I didnt

even care that I got arrested really
because I was with you You know how I
got better at that song

Mirandas look says she doesnt want to know

KYLE (CONTD)

I thought about you About everything I
wanted to tell you about how I feel And
I was sober at the time I promise

Kyle moves toward her She moves away starts walking again

trying to lighten the
mood

MIRANDA
So you realize theres a song for
everything that happens in life

Sometimes there are dozens for one moment
in time like now Yours could be that
REO Speedwagon song about wanting to be
more than friends and mine could be Baby
dont get hooked on me

KYLE
Ive always hated that song

MIRANDA
I got you arrested and Ill always remind
you of a song that you hate That should

be two strike against me

KYLE
Dont count on it

INT AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

James and Miranda come up to a gate carrying their guitars

walks up to the

James
window and watches a plan taxi up to the gate Miranda plops down
in a chair

MIRANDA
I think youre mistaken about how easy it
is to amuse me Its harder than this

James walks over and sits next to her He takes out his guitar

JAMES

Were not here to amuse you were her to
get you some inspiration Look at him

He points at an old man carrying a small bunch of daisies The man
stands looking
expectantly at the gate Miranda looks at him unimpressed

JAMES (CONTD)

Waiting for his wife The woman he
married when she was barely seventeen
The woman he loves just as much today as
the day he met her

MIRANDA
You could write a song from that

JAMES

No Not me I dont write about
everlasting love

MIRANDA
Say hes waiting for Gregor his thirty-
year-old Dutch lover They met in Venice

last Valentines day and have been apart
since then

JAMES
How come

MIRANDA

Howard over there had to have his wife
killed and her collection of exotic
parrots converted into hatbands

JAMES
Should be a touching reunion Not a
country song though What about him
James points at a man about 35 who looks anxiously out the
window at the plane

MIRANDA

He married his high school sweetheart
they have a lovely home and a wonderful
marriage or so everyone think Shes
returning from a Mary Kay convention

JAMES
Or so she says That has possibilities

He plays a few chords and sings a line about the American Dream
gone wrong

The door opens and passengers start coming into the gate area The
old man searches

each face almost as if hes frightened Suddenly his face lights
up A short blue-eyed

woman comes to him her smile just like his He holds her
tightly his fist clenching

the daisies behind her back Nearby a young couple kisses
passionately

James looks at Miranda he told her so Miranda stars at the old
couple who break

apart as if slightly embarrassed The man picks up the womans

bags Hes forgotten
to give her the flowers The young couple continues to kiss

The man who was looking out the window is standing on the edge of
the crowd of
passengers searching for someone

JAMES
Watch him

Finally the man sees who he hes looking for a five-year-old girl
gets off the plane

holding the stewardess® hand The little girl sees him and breaks
free of the stewardess

She yells Daddy and runs to her father who kneels down and
catches her lifting her

in his arms She wraps her little legs around him and hugs his
neck tightly you couldnt

find an inch of space between them

The father closes his eyes for a moment smiling
James looks at Miranda who stares at the father and daughter

She looks like shes
about to cry She turns away embarrassed

MIRANDA
Lets go

She picks up her guitar and walks quickly away from the crowded
gate down the
corridor James hurries to catch up with her

JAMES
Whats the matter

MIRANDA

Nothing

JAMES

OK You dont have to tell me

Miranda steps at an empty waiting area and takes a seat James

sits next to her

MIRANDA

I hate that Someone goes away for two
weeks and its like the end of the fucking
world

JAMES

Whats wrong with missing someone

MIRANDA

If you know theyre coming back you have
no right to miss them Its not like
theyre dead

They sit there a little while James sensing that Mirandas really
upset about something

JAMES

I remember when my grandfather died I
kept waiting for him to come to Sunday
dinner

MIRANDA
How old were you
JAMES
Twenty

Miranda looks at him a little surprised
opens her locket and shows
him inside

MIRANDA
Thats my dad

One side has a black and white photo of her
with a wide grin

The other side has a black and white photo o
James tries a little joke

JAMES
He looks just like Elvis

MIRANDA

That is Elvis He gave me this when I was
ten My decitennial accolade he called
it He raised me since I was five Just
me and him

She hesitates then

father a handsome man

£ Elvis pouting

She looks at the pictures then snaps the locket shut drops it

around her neck

MIRANDA (CONTD)

Presleys my middle name He had this
kind of Elvis thing Nothing weird
JAMES

MIRANDA
Three months ago

JAMES

Thats not very long Its only natural
that you miss him

MIRANDA

Mirandas quiet James just sits with her
silence

JAMES

You want to go

MIRANDA

EXT MOTEL POOL - NIGHT

James sits in a deck chair Miranda sits on the diving board
dangling her toes in the

water Its a hot summer night she wears a t-shirt and shorts
She has her guitar and

is singing Bad Medicine which shes transformed from popmetal
to country She

does the first verse then

MIRANDA
When I get married Im going to have them

play Bad Medicine® as I walk down the
aisle The Bon Jovi version

Miranda climbs off the diving board and sets her guitar in a chair
She goes over to the
pool stops and starts to climb in fully dressed

James starts to play something its the song he started writing
earlier in the airport

about living the American dream but only on the surface He has a
few really good

lines By the hes done Miranda has gotten all the way into the
pool except for her

head Shes been watching him intently the whole time hes been
singing James puts

down his guitar and sits at the edge of the pool

JAMES
Why do you always stay up all night

MIRANDA
Linda Lue snores

JAMES
Are you afraid of the dark

MIRANDA

If I was afraid on the dark I wouldnt
spend so much time in the dark would I
James pulls off his shirt and starts to climb into the pool
Miranda ducks underwater
and comes back up

JAMES
Nightmares

MIRANDA
Not since I was eight

JAMES
Whatd you do then when you a
nightmare

MIRANDA

I would wake up my dad hed come get me
and hed let me stay up all night Wed
light candles and make cookies and play
poker We used to crank call foreign
countries I learned the twist at four in
the morning Then when it got light out
Id go to bed and miss half a day of
school My dad once wrote a not for me
Miranda was unavoidably late to school
today due to a slight pterodactyl crisis
at home The problem has been remedied
and it is unlikely that this will happen

again

They move around the shallow end of the pool not approaching each
other

JAMES

So youve been sleeping during the day
since he died

MIRANDA

At first I couldnt sleep at all then
the only time I could even remember what
he looked like was in the middle of the

night I sometimes think about what Ill
say when I see him again and if Ill

recognize him then I realize I wont see
him again at all

James moves over to Miranda and stands in front of her
MIRANDA (CONTD)

Ive been thinking about something (He
takes her hands)

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I wonder if I1l1l know you in a year

JAMES
I dont know

James moves toward her trying to seduce her
shes going to respond

MIRANDA
If we go out and we break up I probably

wont Ill be just another girl you used
to go out with And someday therell be
so many you wont know which one I was

James backs away from her

JAMES
You want me to say well be together ina
year Because I cant say that

MIRANDA
No Thats not what I want

Its not clear if

A look of realization crosses his face He lets go of her hands

JAMES
You dont want to do this

MIRANDA
I dont think its a good idea

James gets out of the pool hes angry and hes leaving He picks

up his shirt and starts
to walk away then stops and turns to Miranda

JAMES

Im going to have to ask you to tell me
why

MIRANDA
I told you
JAMES

I need the real reason Then well be
friends or whatever it is you want

Miranda sits on the top step on the pool She looks away from him
an tells him the
truth

MIRANDA

Ive been trying to write a song Just
one song to prove I can do it Not even
a good song And you you see two
strangers at an airport and you turn it
into something so incredible Your
song was incredible

JAMES
What youre jealous I might not even
finish that song I have a song I started

three years ago thats not done yet

MIRANDA
Im not jealous Im overwhelmed I just
cant give you that see

JAMES
I dont care

MIRANDA
I do

She stares at him He sees shes set on this and gives up walking
away She sits in the
pool holding her knees to her chest watching him go

INT LUCYS CAF® - NIGHT

Later that night The performances are over and only a few
songwriters hang around

making arrangements to get together and write Miranda puts the
last chair up She

goes over to Lucy whos counting receipts at one of the tables

LUCY

Miranda sits with her
MIRANDA
Lucy do you think anyone can be a
songwriter

LUCY

Ive seen some people who tried about as
hard as a person can try and just never
get it you know I dont think you can
learn it I cant do it

Miranda looks discouraged

LUCY (CONTD)
I didnt mean to bring you down

MIRANDA
I always thought I wanted to be a singer

sing but it doesnt seem like enough
But songwritings so different I just
dont know if its worth it to try It
comes so easily to some people like
James

LUCY
You know whats in this case

She points to the glass case on the wall behind her

contains tacked-up papers

with handwriting on them pages torn from notebooks
napkins an air-

sickness bag Miranda looks and shakes her head no
up and examines the

writing

LUCY (CONTD)

These are all songs by my songwriters
Theyre not all hits but theyre special
songs Like a miracle some golden words
roll off of someones tongue Some of
the took ten minutes some if them took
years Every one of these songwriters
would tell you its worth it You write a

song like one of these and you cant ever
give up again You know what it feels
like to be special and theres nothing

which
cocktail

Lucy stand
and no one that can give you that same
kind of special

Lucy sits back down to get back to work

LUCY (CONTD)

Thats why I worry about you being with

even though Lou always washes them again
before she lets me drink out of them

Theyre standing at the foot of the bed

JAMES
I need for you to shut up now

The best things in my life happen after

He passes by her pulling back her shirt to kiss her shoulder
and sits at the table She

JAMES
I guess you didnt believe her

MIRANDA
Maybe I just decided to risk it

JAMES
Hows your song coming

MIRANDA
I have one line

JAMES
Every song starts with one line

MIRANDA

I dont know if its any good My dad
always said I could do anything I keep
thinking about this song he wrote for me

JAMES
Do you remember it
She nods

JAMES (CONTD)
Let me hear it
Miranda plays the song The lyrics are about a fathers unending
devotion to his
daughter She stops after the first chorus

JAMES

Thats a nice line about falling out of
the sky and landing in love

Hes hesitant like hes searching for something nice to say

MIRANDA
Is that the only thing you liked

JAMES

Its just well devotion is a tricky
theme Of course a parents devoted to
his child You have to have a point of

(CONTD

JAMES (CONTD)

view Like he wants a better life for you
than he had for himself This song starts
at the end of the story

MIRANDA

Every song doesnt have to be about
something you can relate to

JAMES
A good song has something to say even to

people who havent been in that situation

MIRANDA

(hurt)
So its not a good song because you dont
like it
JAMES
Im just telling you what I thought Ive
spent half my life writing songs I know
something about it I thought you were

trying to learn
She stands up

MIRANDA
If you had thought about it you would
have realized this wasnt a good example

She picks up her notebook and walks out of the kitchen James
looks like hes
realizing his mistake

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

She rummages through

the drawer of her nightstand and pulls out a cassette She puts it
in the player on top of

the nightstand and presses play We hear a mans voice speaking

VOICE

And I gave Fish-head four gallons of ice
cream for dinner just like you said Of
was that supposed to be one can of cat
food I couldnt remember and Fish-head
insists that she always has ice cream on
Thursday She also said to tell you she
misses you and she caught a giant spider
that I thought looked a lot like that
Billy Warren kid you think is so cute I
told her youd be home soon Remember if
you get homesick just keep your chin up

Miranda hits the fast-forward button When she hits play again we
hear her father

singing the same song she played for James We hear the second

takes that literally She

doesnt cry She hits the stop button her chin still in the air

notebook and opens it

Everyones laughing It must be getting late because theyre
getting a little giddy Joe

CUT TO
Miranda takes the guitar from Kyle and begins to play her song
Shes a little shy about

it but manages to perform pretty well Her song isnt bad it has
a nice melody but the
lyrics are not especially moving All she has is the first verse

MIRANDA
I dont like that last line

ERICA
No Keep that one I like that line

MIRANDA
Im not sure what it means

NICK
If you wrote it youll figure out what it

means eventually Thats the best line in
your song

LUCY
Miranda Presley

Miranda takes the stage She introduces herself quickly and sings
the song she sang at

Nicks house Shes left in the line that the other musicians
liked Its the most

evocative line in the song and it seems out of place with the
rest of the lyrics Luc

watches Miranda with a small smile on her face shes impressed
that Miranda is taking
this seriously

Lucy appears behind them and shushes him They look at her
guiltily She leaves

James reaches for Mirandas hand Shes reluctant to give it to
him but he gives her a

pleading look and gently takes her hand placing it palm up in his
left hand With his

right he spells something onto her hand with his finger When
she realized what the

message is she turns and watches him finish spelling He looks
into her eyes She

closes her hand into a fist turns away and pulls it under her

herself She watches Linda Lue finishing up her song James

INT RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

James is in the recording studio with a band of session musicians
DOUG ROBERTS

the manager who gave James his card at the Roadhouse sits in the
booth with the

engineer The musicians are all in their thirties and forties
most of them look like

somebodys father Theyre doing one of the songs weve heard
James do before but

this version seems to lack energy James is clearly dissatisfied
with the way things are

going but is trying to be patient He stops singing in the
middle of the song and cuts

the band

JAMES

We need to bring up the snares

DOUG
(over microphone)
They sound fine in here

JAMES
This tempos all wrong

DOUG

Dont worry It sounds great

JAMES

Im not deaf I can tell how it sounds

From the way he says this we know he hates the way it sounds

DOUG

We1l just get it down once this way ok
James

JAMES

No Thats not the way I wrote it

James looks determined Doug leaves the booth and comes into the
studio to talk some

sense into James The musicians watch uninterested Theyve seen
this before

DOUG
James I know you feel strongly about your
song You should its your baby But
Ive been doing this since you were a

baby I know what a hit sounds like
Dougs matter is soothing condescending
JAMES

I know what shit sounds like

DOUG

It doesnt sound like shit It sounds
like what every country radio station is
looking for I have to think in terms of
radio play

JAMES

I record this the way I wrote it or I
dont record it at all

The musicians start to take notice the fight is finally heating
up

DOUG
Im already taking a big risk with you

JAMES
Dont do me any favors

He starts to gather up his stuff

DOUG
Go ahead Walk out No one else will
touch you Everyone knows about you

James stands face to face with Doug

JAMES
What does everyone know about me

DOUG
Youve got a hell of an attitude for a
pretty boy with a couple of good songs

This is just part of Dougs act the way he keeps singers in line
but James anger

flashes Before Doug can see it coming James punches him in the
eye
The musicians look at each other entertained James walks out

MIRANDA
Yes Its enough
LINDA LUE

they fall around her
face Miranda steps back and appraises her work

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Better Wait

Miranda reaches to the dressing table and gets a Q-tip She runs
the Q-tip under Linda

Lues eye removing some of the eyeliner then does the same for

JAMES (CONTD)
You know what this reminds me of

He looks at Miranda she has no idea

JAMES (CONTD)
When I was a kid my dad used to take me

in
having a boys® night out going bowling or
to the movies or the rodeo if there was

house for a long time he was seeing my
fifth-grade health teacher

Miranda studies him looking for signs of sadness at the memory
and finding none

JAMES (CONTD)

And Id sit in the car we had a blue
Pontiac and hed leave me the keys and
Id listen to the radio

(laughs)

One night I taught myself how to drive in
that car waiting for my dad The antenna
had this bend in it

(motions with his hand)

and no matter what I did I couldnt get
one damn FM station in that car So Id
sit there and listen to the country music
station and stare at the house I never
could take my eyes off the house

He takes Mirandas hand his eyes still on Graceland

JAMES (CONTD)

Just like all those damn cheating songs

And all my life people would tell me
James youre just like your father
And I never said it but I thought no Im
not I never lie I dont pretend to be a
great guy The high point of my fathers
life was a football game in high school

No way was I going to be just like him

But now I wonder if I can help I it

Miranda looks confused

JAMES (CONTD)
Sometimes I feel like Im going to spend
the rest of my life with everyone thinking

Im someone Im not

MIRANDA

Its hard to think about what youre going
to do for the rest of your life You have
to pick one thing What if it doesnt
work out
James nods

JAMES
You look stupid Youre a failure

Miranda takes his chin in her hand and turns his face toward her
She kisses him

MIRANDA
I dont think you could ever be a failure

She climbs out of the truck bed She reaches inside the truck and
turns on the radio

tuning it to a slow song (eg Asking us to dance) She
climbs back up into the back

and stands next to James holding her hand out to him He slowly
gets up his eye

locked with hers and takes her hand

They start to dance underneath the stars holding each other
close James pulls her

closer tight against him until they arent dancing anymore

JAMES
(softly)
Im scared

MIRANDA
So am I

The song plays on as they hold on to each other Finally James
pulls away until he

isnt touching Miranda anymore He takes his hand and moves it
along her arm from

the shoulder down to her wrist without touching her

JAMES
Do you feel that

MIRANDA
Yeah

The skies have become cloudy Theres lightning in the distance
Elvis comes on the
radio and it begins to sprinkle

Linda Lue hugs her then gets up and closes her suitcase

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Linda Lue and the dog are gone Miranda sits cross-legged on her
bed her

notebook open in front of her We hear Pam Tillis passionately
singing

Maybe it was Memphis

Miranda picks up a piece of paper that looks like her marriage
certificate She

folds it in half and cuts it into a heart shape She unfolds it
and cuts the heart

into pieces with a jagged break She positions them on a page of
her

notebook

Theres a knock at the door Miranda opens it to find Kyle

standing there
EXT REDS BAR - NIGHT

Kyle leads Miranda out of the bar shes a little tipsy They
pass aman ina

cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk singing for tips Miranda
sings along

with him

KYLE
I dont know how productive this was

MIRANDA
Well Im having a pretty good time

Lets go somewhere else Wanna go to
Graceland

Kyles just trying to get her into the car without incident

KYLE
Lets get you home

MIRANDA
I dont get it

KYLE

MIRANDA
This whole thing Whats the matter with
me
KYLE
Nothing You are perfect
MIRANDA
No Theres something wrong with me
Nobody wants me Nobody cares about me
Shes really getting upset Kyle wraps his arms around her
holding her like a
child
KYLE
(soothing)
I care I want you
She shakes her head no He strokes her hair back off her face

KYLE (CONTD)
I care I care about you

Miranda still doesnt look like shes herself

MIRANDA
Do you love me

Kyle loosens his hold on her he has to protect himself now

KYLE
Miranda dont ask me that right now

MIRANDA
(persistent)
Are you in love with me

Kyle pulls away from her altogether

KYLE
Yes

She pulls him to her slowly and kisses him passionately He
kisses her back
then breaks away gently and looks at her quietly angry
KYLE (CONTD)
I dont know what youre doing but stop
it now I wont let you use me

She feels terrible she was using him

MIRANDA
Im sorry Really

KYLE

Damn it Miranda what do you want me to
do

MIRANDA

I dont know I want you to stay in love
with me always and I want you to get over
me and be my friend forever

KYLE
Do you think I have some kind of choice

Miranda gives him a questioning look she really doesnt
understand how he
feels

KYLE (CONTD)

Sometimes you hear a song on the radio

and its just the song you wanted to hear
right then Its like a gift Then its
over and youre just glad you heard it
You dont want them to play it again right
away Youll hear that song again or

another one thats just the perfect song
when you hear it

MIRANDA
And Im like that song the first one

KLYE

No you are nothing like that first one
Youre like if there was only one song in
the world I could hear for the rest of my

life what song would that be Youre
that song

MIRANDA
Maybe the needles just stuck

KYLE
Youre the song that stays in my head all

day and I dont even mind it Youre my
favorite song

MIRANDA
For awhile my favorite song was Shadow
Dancin® Its not anymore

KYLE

(angry)
You know what the problem with you is
You make it so hard for someone to care

about you that once they do theres no

turning back Its hot or cold theres
no lukewarm

Kyle realizes something sadly
KYLE (CONTD)
Thats why James11 come back

Miranda wont allow herself to hope for this

MIRANDA

No he wont Its ok This kind of
thing happens to me all the time

KYLE
Miranda What are you going to do when he
comes back

Miranda sits down on the curb Kyle sits next to her
MIRANDA

Im not going to be here Im going back

home

This is the last thing Kyle wants to hear

KYLE
This is your home

MIRANDA
Do you know how hard it was to leave New
York I had wanted to do it for years and
then my father died and I just did it
left everything behind I think I thought
I could pay him back for giving up his
dream Now I know he wouldve given it up
sooner or later anyway When you think
you have a dream all it does is give you
hope that you can have something good

then you find out you can never have that

Maybe it wasnt even there to be had

KYLE

Dont think that You cant live your
life thinking that

MIRANDA

Kyle all the signs are pointing in the
same direction Away from Nashville

Away from country music At some point I
have to pay attentions I have to start
again

KYLE

You could do that here You didnt come
here because of your father You came

here to write songs

MIRANDA
Saying youre going to do something and
actually doing it are two different things

KYLE
You have them inside you What if you go

to New York and you never get them out

MIRANDA

Dont make me feel any worse This is all
I have left

Kyle shakes his head disagreeing

KYLE
You still have everything that matters

She doesnt answer They sit side by side
by

James has picked up a hitchhiker and old man who listens passively

thinks she knows everything about me

Theyre all

empty He goes into the kitchen and finds a house key on the
table

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

touches her

arm Miranda raises her head and squints at her

WAITRESS

The waitress fills her coffee cup Miranda looks down at the
table Her

notebook is open the page is filled with words She looks at
them as if for

the first time She doesnt seem sure if she likes what she sees

INT LUCYS CAF® - NIGHT

James comes into the caf and finds Lucy and Nicks engagement
party in

progress A singer onstage dedicates a song to the happy couple
who sit ata

table near the back James looks around for Miranda and not
seeing her

goes over to Lucy and Nick
JAMES

LUCY
No honey Im sorry

Lucy doesnt want to have to tell him

LUCY
She told me she was going back to New
York

his is a blow but James still has hope

She left this morning

James deflates his hope gone

LUCY (CONTD)

Lucy nods and gets up James sits down next to Nick

JAMES (CONTD)
Congratulations

NICK
Thank you

JAMES
You want some advice from an old married
man Dont leave her

NICK
The important thing is you came back for
her No matter what happens you did the
right thing
James finds this little consolation

INT LUCYS CAF® - NIGHT

Later that night Kyle is onstage performing a love song for
Lucy and Nick
James has moved to the bar he faces away from the stage

Miranda walks in carrying her guitar She finds Lucy and goes to
her Lucy
is happy to see her They have a brief conversation which we
dont hear
because Kyle is singing We now that Lucy tells her James is here
because
Miranda looks over to where he sits She looks apprehensive then
takes a

deep breath and regains her resolve

Kyle finishes his song Lucy comes onstage and speaks into the
microphone

LUCY

Kyle Davidson Thank you Kyle

Everyone applauds as Kyle climbs off the stage He sees Miranda
waiting to

go on and grins surprised and glad that shes back He hugs her
and we see

from the look on his face that he knows hes really lost her now

The applause dies down

LUCY

Now this next performer is kind of
special to me and Im real glad she could
make it here tonight Here she is
Miranda Presley

James turns around Miranda sits on the stool and positions the
stand so that

she can read the pages she tore from her notebook She looks
nervous but

determined She doesnt look at James

Miranda begins to play She begins to sing the lyrics looking
down and
reading them The song shes written is beautiful and expresses a
personal

journey Shes realized that she has to accept her painful
emotions before she

can experience joy The song hardly resembles the one she
auditioned with

earlier but the one line she said she didnt understand is still

there and fits

perfectly in the new version of the song

The audience recognizes the beauty of this song Most just enjoy
it but we

see pride on the faces of Nick Lucy and Kyle James looks like
someone

whod fallen in love all over again Miranda realizes that
everyone is listening

to what she has to say and she loves it She looks at James
letting him know

the man she loves in the song is him She finishes the song and
theres a

pause before everyone applauds James seat is now empty She
smiles

triumphantly and gets off the stage Shes looking for James but
she doesnt

see him People are congratulating her but shes starting to
worry Suddenly
someone takes her hand She looks next to her and sees James

MIRANDA
(relieved)
I thought you had left
JAMES
I did but I came back I thought you had
left

MIRANDA
I did but I came back

She notices something in her hand

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Whats this

She looks its a thin silver wedding ring

JAMES
I figured out the best thing to do with

the rest of my life

She holds the ring out to him Confused he takes it back She
presents him

her left hand and he slips it on her finger They kiss When
they break

apart James notices something behind Miranda He puts his hands
on her

shoulders and turns her around to look

Lucy opens up the case where she keeps original copies of special
songs and

pins Mirandas song up next to them Miranda watches smiling

THE END
