MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and
whisper with desperate intensity

MR DASHWOOD
John you will find out soon enough
from my will that the estate of
Norland was left to me in such a way
as prevents me from dividing it
between my families

JOHN blinks He cannot quite take it in

JOHN
Calm yourself Father This is not
good for you

But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater

MR DASHWOOD
Norland in its entirety is therefore
yours by law and I am happy for you
and Fanny

JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected
delight

MR DASHWOOD
But your stepmother my wife and
daughters are left with only five
hundred pounds a year barely enough
to live on and nothing for the girls
dowries You must help them

JOHNs face is a picture of conflicting emotions

them is the ominous rustling of parchments
JOHN
Of course

MR DASHWOOD

A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHNs natural
hypocrisy

JOHN
I promise Father I promise

keenly

FANNY
What do you mean help them

JOHN
Dearest I mean to give them three
thousand pounds
frock

flapping
is in

helplessly

FANNY goes very still JOHN gets nervous

JOHN
The interest will provide them with
a little extra income Such a gift
will certainly discharge my promise
to my father

FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror

FANNY
Oh without question More than
amply

JOHN

One had rather on such occasions
do too much than too little

A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again

JOHN
Of course he did not stipulate a
particular sum

INT LAUNDRY - NORLAND PARK - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD is rushing about mourning ribbons
putting her knick-knacks into a small valise The room

chaos A young WOMAN (ELINOR DASHWOOD) looks on

MRS DASHWOOD
To be reduced to the condition of
visitor in my own home It is not to
be borne Elinor

ELINOR
Consider Mamma We have nowhere to
go

MRS DASHWOOD
John and Fanny will descend from
London at any moment followed no
doubt by cartloads of relatives ready
to turn us out of our rooms one by
one do you expect me to be here to
welcome them Vultures

tears

new house at once Until then we
must try to bear their coming

Fifteen hundred then What say you
to fifteen hundred
FANNY
What brother on earth would do half
so much for his real sisters--let
alone half-blood
JOHN
They can hardly expect more
FANNY
There is no knowing what they expect
The question is what can you afford
INT NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

at
the piano playing a particularly sad piece ELINOR
enters

Marianne cannot you play something
else Mamma has been weeping since
breakfast
MARIANNE stops turns the pages of her music book and
starts

playing something equally lugubrious

ELINOR
I meant something less mournful
dearest
EXT ROADSIDE INN - DAY

JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the

final
adjustments to their carriage The LANDLORD hovers
waiting
for a tip
JOHN
A hundred pounds a year to their
mother while she lives Would that
be more advisable It is better than
parting with the fifteen hundred all
at once
He displays some coins in his hand FANNY removes one
and
nods
FANNY
But if she should live longer than
fifteen years we would be completely
taken in People always live forever
when there is an annuity to be paid
them
JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD

ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a
small
staircase issues
ELINOR
Margaret are you there Please come
down John and Fanny will be here
soon
A pause ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied
and

truculent young voice stops her

MARGARET (VO)
Why are they coming to live at
Norland They already have a house
in London

ELINOR
Because houses go from father to
son dearest not from father to
daughter It is the law
Silence ELINOR tries another tack

ELINOR
f you come inside we could play
with your atlas

MARGARET (VO)
ts not my atlas any more Its
their atlas

CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this
statement

INT JOHN AND FANNYS CARRIAGE - DAY
JOHN and FANNY joggle on

JOHN
Twenty pounds now and then will amply
discharge my promise you are quite
right

FANNY
Indeed Although to say the truth I
am convinced within myself that your
father had no idea of your giving
them money

JOHN
They will have five hundred a year
amongst them as it is--

FANNY
--and what on earth can four women
want for more than that Their
housekeeping will be nothing at all
they will have no carriage no horses
hardly any servants and will keep no
company Only conceive how comfortable
they will be

INT NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS HALL - DAY

The entire family with the exception of MARGARET is
BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff
Cutlery clinks JOHN chews loudly MARIANNE is rigid
resentment MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool removed
ELINOR tries to play hostess

ELINOR
How is Mrs Ferrars

FANNY
My mother is always in excellent
health thank you My brother Robert
is in town with her this season and
quite the most popular bachelor in
London He has his own barouche
In the brief silence which follows this FANNY
surreptitiously
checks the hallmark on her butterknife

ELINOR
You have two brothers have you not

FANNY
Indeed yes Edward is the eldest
Mamma quite depends upon him He is
traveling up from Plymouth shortly
and will break his journey here

MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly JOHN notices

JOHN
(to MRS DASHWOOD)
If that is agreeable to you of
course

MRS DASHWOOD
My dear John this is your home now

FANNY looks about barely able to conceal her

satisfaction

INT NORLAND PARK - ELINORS BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels She
puts a

shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as
MARIANNE

thunders in looking mutinous

MARIANNE
Fanny wishes to know where the key
for the silver cabinet is kept

ELINOR
Betsy has it I think What does
Fanny want with the silver

MARIANNE
I can only presume she wants to count
it What are you doing

ELINOR
Presents for the servants Have you
seen Margaret I am worried about
her She has taken to hiding in the
oddest places
MARIANNE
Fortunate girl At least she can
escape Fanny which is more than any
of us is able

ELINOR
You do your best You have not said
a word to her for a week

MARIANNE
(truculently)

I have I have said yes and

no

INT NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

FANNY MRS DASHWOOD ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast

MARIANNE enters ELINOR catches her eye and indicates
FANNY

with a slight motion of her head MARIANNE makes a
face

MARIANNE
(very polite)
Good morning Fanny

FANNY is rather startled

FANNY
Good morning Marianne

ELINOR is relieved

MARIANNE
(to Fanny)
How did you find the silver Is it
all genuine

ELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further

ELINOR
Pray when may we expect the pleasure
of your brothers company

FANNY
Edward is due tomorrow And my dear
Mrs Dashwood in view of the fact
that he will not be with us for long
I wondered if Miss Margaret would
mind giving up her room to him the
view is quite incomparable from her
windows and I should so much like
Edward to see Norland at its best
at

gravel

shaken

prietorial

MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look
ELINOR

INT NORLAND PARK - MARGARETS BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARETs toys

MARIANNE
Intolerable woman

ELINOR
There is but one consolation if Edward
is anything like Fanny we shall be
only too happy to leave

EXT NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY

A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the
drive

CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant facade

INT NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
Everyone except MARGARET is present EDWARD has just

bands with ELINOR He behaves with great respect to the
DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNYs pro

air

FANNY
But where is Miss Margaret I declare
Mrs Dashwood I am beginning to doubt
of her existence She must run
positively wild

MRS DASHWOOD
Forgive us Mr Ferrars My youngest
is not to be found this morning She
is a little shy of strangers at
present

EDWARD
Naturally I am also shy of strangers
and I have nothing like her excuse

MARIANNE
(dangerous)
How do you like your view Mr Ferrars

ELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with
careful consideration

EDWARD
Very much Your stables are very
handsome and beautifully kept Mrs

Dashwood

FANNY
Stables Edward--your windows overlook
the lake

EDWARD

An oversight Fanny led me to the
wrong room I have rectified the
situation and am happily settled in
the guest quarters

MARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise

FANNY

looks furious

MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD

CLOSE on ELINOR She is impressed

INT NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY

FANNY is walking with EDWARD who looks at the pictures
with

interest

FANNY
They are all exceedingly spoilt I
find Miss Margaret spends all her
time up trees and under furniture
and I have barely had a civil word
from Marianne

EDWARD
My dear Fanny they have just lost
their father their lives will never
be the same again

FANNY
That is no excuse

INT NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY

FANNY leads EDWARD in She sniffs with distaste

to

EDWARD

his

table

her

FANNY
I have never liked the smell of books

EDWARD
Oh No The dust perhaps

As they speak EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating
apparently all by itself across the floor Someone is
obviously under the table pulling it out of sight He
registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to
it from FANNY He turns back searching for something

divert her

EDWARD
I hear you have great plans for the
walnut grove

FANNY
Oh yes I shall have it pulled down
to make room for a Grecian temple

There is a stifled wail from under the table which
covers with a cough
EDWARD
How picturesque Will you show me
the site
And he ushers FANNY out flicking a quick glance over
shoulder at the fugitives foot
INT NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY
ELINOR MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a

pounds a year I will send out more
inquiries today

There is a knock on the door Hesitantly EDWARD
EDWARD

Pardon my intrusion but I believe I

have found what you are looking for
MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical
but ELINOR immediately understands and rises in
relief
INT NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY
EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout

door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax
MARGARET out FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she

giving instructions EDWARD pretends to examine the

and she passes on unsuspecting

ELINOR (VO)
Wont you come out dearest We
havent seen you all day Mamma is
very concerned

More silence EDWARD thinks hard He makes a decision
INT NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY
EDWARD walks in loudly
EDWARD
Oh Miss Dashwood Excuse me I was
wondering do you by any chance have
such a thing as a reliable atlas

ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment

ELINOR
I believe so

EDWARD
Excellent I wish to check the
position of the Nile

EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere

EDWARD
My sister says it is in South America

From under the table we hear a snort ELINOR looks at

him in
realisation
ELINOR
Oh No no indeed She is quite wrong
For I believe it is in--in Belgium
EDWARD
Belgium Surely not You must be
thinking of the Volga
MARGARET
(from under the table)
The Volga
ELINOR
Of course The Volga which as you
know starts in
EDWARD
Vladivostok and ends in
ELINOR
St Albans
EDWARD
Indeed Where the coffee beans come
from
They are having such a good time that it is rather a
pity
the game is stopped by the appearance from under the
table
of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl
of

INT NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

JOHN is reading a newspaper MRS DASHWOOD sits across
FANNY who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine

is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the
of course we should like to leave as soon as

Suddenly she hears a commotion outside MARGARET runs
the window brandishing a stick EDWARD follows and

to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting
feint and parry EDWARD serious and without a hint of
condescension MARGARET concentrating furiously EDWARD
suddenly turns as though feeling ELINORs gaze She
but looks away quickly

INT NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is
to MARIANNE playing a concerto ELINOR stands ina
rather sad attitude her back to us Suddenly she

EDWARD behind her and turns He is about to turn away
embarrassed to have been caught admiring her when he

she has been weeping Hastily she tries to dry her
comes forward and offers her a handkerchief which she
with a grateful smile We notice his monogram in the

ELINOR

ELINOR
(apologetic)
That was my fathers favourite

EDWARD nods kindly

ELINOR
Thank you so much for your help with
Margaret Mr Ferrars She is a changed
girl since your arrival

EDWARD
Not at all I enjoy her company

ELINOR
Has she shown you her tree-house

EDWARD
Not yet Would you do me the honour
Miss Dashwood It is very fine out

ELINOR
With pleasure

They start to walk out of shot still talking

ELINOR
Margaret has always wanted to travel

EDWARD
I know She is heading an expedition
to China shortly I am to go as her
servant but only on the understanding
that I will be very badly treated

ELINOR
What will your duties be

EDWARD
Sword-fighting administering rum

and swabbing

ELINOR
Ah

CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing
the staircase smiling down at them CAM tilts up yet

to find FANNY on the landing above watching EDWARD and
with a face like a prune
EXT NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY

EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in
arm

in the late afternoon sun

EDWARD
All I want--all I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life but
my mother is determined to see me
distinguished

ELINOR
As

EDWARD
She hardly knows Any fine figure
will suit a great orator a leading
politician even a barrister would
serve but only on the condition
that I drive my own barouche and
dine in the first circles

His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness
to
it

ELINOR
And what do you wish for

EDWARD
I always preferred the church but
that is not smart enough for my mother
she prefers the army but that is a
great deal too smart for me

ELINOR
Would you stay in London

EDWARD
I hate London No peace A country
living is my ideal a small parish
where I might do some good keep
chickens and give very short sermons

EXT FIELDS NEAR NORLAND - DAY

EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback The atmosphere is
intimate the quality of the conversation rooted now in
their
affections

ELINOR
You talk of feeling idle and useless
imagine how that is compounded when
one has no choice and no hope
whatsoever of any occupation

EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it

EDWARD
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same

ELINOR
Except that you will inherit your
fortune

He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her
boldness

ELINOR
We cannot even earn ours

EDWARD
Perhaps Margaret is right

ELINOR
Right

EDWARD
Piracy is our only option

They ride on in silence for a moment

EDWARD
What is swabbing exactly

INT NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

Dinner is over JOHN and FANNY are examining plans of
the

Norland estate looking for somewhere to builda
hermitage

EDWARD is reading out loud ELINOR embroiders and
listens

MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE make up the rest of the
audience

the latter in a state of high impatience

EDWARD
No voice divine the storm allayed No
light propitious shone When snatched
from all effectual aid We perished
each alone But I beneath a rougher
sea And whelmed in deeper gulfs

than he

MARIANNE jumps up and goes to him

MARIANNE
No Edward Listen

She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with
passionate brio

MARIANNE
Can you not feel his despair Try
again

Rather mortified EDWARD starts again but not before
receiving a sympathetic look from ELINOR which seems to
comfort him a little

INT NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAY

MRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly MARIANNE rushes in
holding
a letter

MARIANNE
Mamma look This has just arrived

MRS DASHWOOD
(reading from the
letter)
I should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage as soon as
ever you have need of it why it is
from my cousin Sir John Middleton

MARIANNE
Even Elinor must approve the rent

MRS DASHWOOD looks at the letter again and thinks

MRS DASHWOOD
Has Elinor not yet seen this

MARIANNE
No I will fetch her

MRS DASHWOOD
Wait No Let us delay
MARIANNE
Why

MRS DASHWOOD
I think--I believe that Edward and
Elinor have formed an attachment

Marianne nods a little reluctantly

MRS DASHWOOD
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon and Devonshire is so far

MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision She takes the letter
and

hides it in the pocket of her gown MARIANNE looks on

frowningly

MRS DASHWOOD
Why so grave Do you disapprove her
choice

MARIANNE
By no means Edward is very amiable

MRS DASHWOOD
Amiable but

MARIANNE
But there is something wanting He
is too sedate his reading last night

MRS DASHWOOD
Elinor has not your feelings his
reserve suits her

MARIANNE thinks for a little

MARIANNE
Can he love her Can the ardour of
the soul really be satisfied with
such polite concealed affections
To love is to burn to be on fire
all made of passion of adoration
of sacrifice Like Juliet or
Guinevere or Heloise

MRS DASHWOOD
They made rather pathetic ends dear

MARIANNE
her

teasingly

suspiciously

Pathetic To die for love How can
you say so What could be more
glorious

MRS DASHWOOD
I think that may be taking your
romantic sensibilities a little far

MARIANNE
The more I know of the world the
more I am convinced that I shall
never see a man whom I can truly
love

MRS DASHWOOD
You require so much

MARIANNE
I do not I require only what any
young woman of taste should a man
who sings well dances admirably
rides bravely reads with passion
and whose tastes agree in every point
with my own

INT NORLAND PARK - ELINORS BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELINOR is

in bed deep in thought MARIANNE enters in

nightclothes carrying a book of poetry She reads

She jumps

MARIANNE

Is love a fancy or a feeling No It
is immortal as immaculate truth Tis
not a blossom shed as soon as Youth
Drops from the stem of life for it
will grow In barren regions where
no waters flow Nor ray of promise
cheats the pensive gloom--

onto the bed ELINOR smiles somewhat

MARIANNE
What a pity it is that Edward has no
passion for reading

ELINOR
It was you who asked him to read and
then you made him nervous
MARIANNE
Me

ELINOR
But your behaviour to him in all
other respects is perfectly cordial
so I must assume that you like him
in spite of his deficiencies

MARIANNE
(trying hard)
I think him everything that is amiable
and worthy

ELINOR
Praise indeed

MARIANNE
But he shall have my unanswering
devotion when you tell me he is to
be my brother

ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to
reply
Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately

MARIANNE
How shall I do without you

ELINOR
Do without me

MARIANNE pulls away her eyes full of tears

MARIANNE
I am sure you will be very happy
But you must promise not to live too
far away

ELINOR
Marianne there is no question of
that is there is no under standing
between

ELINOR trails off MARIANNE looks at her keenly

MARIANNE
Do you love him

The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR

ELINOR
up

amused

POV

FANNY
but

sweetly

I do not attempt to deny that I think
very highly of him that I greatly
esteem that like him

MARIANNE

Esteem him Like him Use those
insipid words again and I shall leave
the room this instant

This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort

ELINOR

Very well Forgive me Believe my
feelings to be stronger than I have
declared but further than that you
must not believe

MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks
her book again
MARIANNE
Is love a fancy or a feeling Or a

ELINOR
Go to bed

ELINOR blushes in good earnest MARIANNE goes to the

I do not attempt to deny that I
think highly of him greatly esteem

And she is gone leaving ELINOR both agitated and

INT NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

FANNY is standing by the window looking out We see her
of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden

MRS DASHWOOD enters pauses for a moment and then joins
at the window FANNY pretends not to have been watching

MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles
at her

MRS DASHWOOD
We are all so happy that you chose
to invite Edward to Norland He is a
dear boy and we are all very fond of
him

FANNY does a bit of quick thinking

FANNY
We have great hopes for him Much is
expected of him by our mother with
regard to his profession

MRS DASHWOOD
Naturally

FANNY
And in marriage She is determined
that both he and Robert will marry
well

MRS DASHWOOD
Of course But I hope she desires
them to marry for love first and
foremost I have always felt that
contrary to common wisdom true
affection is by far the most valuable
dowry

FANNY
Love is all very well but
unfortunately we cannot always rely
on the heart to lead us in the most
suitable directions

FANNY lowers her voice confidingly

FANNY
You see my dear Mrs Dashwood Edward
is entirely the kind of compassionate
person upon whom penniless women can
prey--and having entered into any
kind of understanding he would never
go back on his word He is quite
simply incapable of doing so But it
would lead to his ruin I worry for
him so Mrs Dashwood My mother has
always made it perfectly plain that
she will withdraw all financial
support from Edward should he choose

The entire family is present Everyone is watching MRS
DASHWOOD who has just made her announcement

EDWARD

He is devastated FANNY is thrilled MRS DASHWOOD looks
him with compassion and then at ELINOR who is trying
keep calm

MRS DASHWOOD
My cousin Sir John Middleton has
offered us a small house on his
estate

JOHN
Sir John Middleton What is his
situation He must be a man of
property

MRS DASHWOOD
He is a widower He lives with his
mother-in-law at Barton Park and it
is Barton Cottage that he offers us
FANNY
Oh a cottage How charming A little
cottage is always very snug

EDWARD
But you will not leave before the
summer

MRS DASHWOOD
Oh my dear Edward we can no longer
trespass upon your sisters good
will We must leave as soon as

possible

MARGARET
You will come and stay with us

Edward has long been expected in
town by our mother

MRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY

MRS DASHWOOD
Come as soon as you can Edward
Remember that you are always welcome

INTEXT NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY

ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE She
strokes the

soft face sadly Then she senses someone and turns to
find

EDWARD standing nearby

EDWARD
Cannot you take him with you

ELINOR
We cannot possibly afford him

EDWARD
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen

ELINOR tries to smile EDWARD looks at her for a long
moment
and then comes closer

EDWARD
Miss Dashwood--Elinor I must talk
to you

The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving

tone-—-
stops ELINORs breath altogether
EDWARD

She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR who

for a vase SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff
insensitivity

SIR JOHN
Miss Marianne I cannot see why you
should set your cap at Mr Willoughby
when you have already made such a
splendid conquest

MARIANNE
I have no intention of setting my
cap at anyone Sir John

COLONEL BRANDON
Mr Willoughby--Lady Allens nephew

BRANDONs light tone betrays no emotion ELINOR comes
in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to
MARIANNE

SIR JOHN

Aye he visits every year for he is
to inherit Allenham--and he has a
very pretty estate of his own Miss
Dashwood Combe Magna in Somerset
If I were you I would not give him
up to my younger sister in spite of
all this tumbling down hills

Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming Mariannes
preserver

at the top of her voice Everyone starts to move at
once

MARGARET is silenced BRANDON looks at MARIANNE whose

incandescent expression makes her feelings all too
clear

SIR JOHN
Here is the man himself Come Brandon--
we know when we are not wanted Let
us leave him to the ladies

ELINOR
Marianne Sir John and the Colonel
are leaving

MARIANNE looks up suddenly self-conscious

MARIANNE
Goodbye Colonel Thank you for the
flowers

ELINOR sees them out We hear WILLOUGHBYs voice

outside
CLOSE on MARIANNEs radiant anticipation

WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and
SIR

WILLOUGHBY
How do you do Colonel

SIR JOHN
How does he do How do you do more

ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY MRS DASHWOOD greets him
with
outstretched arms

MRS DASHWOOD
Mr Willoughby What a pleasure to
see you again

WILLOUGHBY
The pleasure is all mine I can
asstire you I trust Miss Marianne
has not caught cold

MARIANNE
You have found out my name

WILLOUGHBY
Of course The neighbourhood is
crawling with my spies

He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from
behind his

back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly
humorous

bow

WILLOUGHBY
And since you cannot venture out to
nature nature must be brought to
you

MARIANNE
How beautiful These are not from
the hothouse

WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDONs flowers

WILLOUGHBY
Ah I see mine is not the first
offering nor the most elegant I am
afraid I obtained these from an
obliging field

MARIANNE
But I have always preferred wild

flowers

WILLOUGHBY
I suspected as much

ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY

ELINOR
I will put these in water

MRS DASHWOOD
Our gratitude Mr Willoughby is
beyond expression--

WILLOUGHBY
But it is I who am grateful I have
often passed this cottage and grieved
for its lonely state--and then the
first news I had from Lady Allen
when I arrived was that it was taken
I felt a peculiar interest in the
event which nothing can account for
but my present delight in meeting
you

He is merry spirited voluble--a breath of fresh air
brings back WILLOUGHBYs flowers and places them next
BRANDONs on the side table

MRS DASHWOOD
Pray sit down Mr Willoughby

She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying
MARIANNEs footstool picks it up and--to her great
sits down on the stool at her feet

WILLOUGHBY
Who is reading Shakespeares sonnets

Everyone answers at once

MARIANNEELINORMRS DASHWOOD
I am We all are Marianne

Marianne has been reading them out
to us

their

delighted
synchronicity

though

ELINOR

WILLOUGHBY and

WILLOUGHBY
Which are your favourites

It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers

MARIANNE

Without a doubt mine is 116
WILLOUGHBY

Let me not to the marriage of true

minds Admit impediments Love is not

love Which alters when it alteration

finds Or bends with the remover to

remove--then how does it go

MARIANNE
O no it is an ever-fixed mark

WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and
ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances Clearly
contribution to this conversation will be minimal
WILLOUGHBY
That looks on storms--or is it
tempests Let me find it
WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book
WILLOUGHBY
It is strange you should be reading
them--for look I carry this with
me always
It is a miniature copy of the sonnets MARIANNE is
and mutually astonished at this piece of
they proceed to look up other favourites chatting as
they were already intimates
MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction
amused picks up her sewing MARGARET stares

MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other

EXT BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY
WILLOUGHBY is leaving He has a flower from MARIANNEs

bunch
in his buttonhole and is on his horse looking about as
virile
as his horse Everyone has come out to say goodbye
MARIANNE
supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD
WILLOUGHBY
Till tomorrow And my pocket sonnets
are yours Miss Marianne A talisman
against further injury
MARIANNE
Goodbye Thank you
He gallops off They all wave MARGARET follows him
down the

road for a while

ELINOR
Good work Marianne You have covered
all forms of poetry another meeting
will ascertain his views on nature
and romantic attachments and then
you will have nothing left to talk
about and the acquaintanceship will
be over

MARIANNE
I suppose I have erred against
decorum I should have been dull and
spiritless and talked only of the
weather or the state of the roads

ELINOR
No but Mr Willoughby can be in no
doubt of your enthusiasm for him

MARIANNE
Why should he doubt it Why should I
hide my regard

ELINOR
No particular reason Marianne only
that we know so little of him--

MARIANNE
But time alone does not determine
intimacy Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people
acquainted with each other and seven
days are more than enough for others

ELINOR
Or seven hours in this case

MARIANNE
I feel I know Mr Willoughby well
already If I had weaker more shallow
feelings perhaps I could conceal
them as you do--

Then she realises what shes said

MRS DASHWOOD
Marianne that is not fair--

MARIANNE
I am sorry Elinor I did not mean

ELINOR
I know Do not trouble yourself
Marianne

ELINOR turns back into the house

MARIANNE
I do not understand her Mamma Why
does she never mention Edward I
have never even seen her cry about
him or about Norland

MRS DASHWOOD
Nor I But Elinor is not like you or
I dear She does not like to be
swayed by her emotions

MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together
MARIANNE is dressed to go out The argument has

started indoors and is being continued here

MARIANNE
If there was any true impropriety in
my behaviour I should be sensible
of it Elinor--

ELINOR
But as it has already exposed you to
some very impertinent remarks do
you not begin to doubt your own
discretion

MARIANNE
If the impertinent remarks of such
as Mrs Jennings are proof of
impropriety then we are all offending
every moment of our lives--

The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL
on horseback
COLONEL BRANDON
(dismounting)

Miss Dashwood Miss Marianne

ELINOR
and

her

nods

tense

Good morning Colonel

COLONEL BRANDON
I come to issue an invitation A
picnic on my estate at Delaford--if
you would care to join us on Thursday
next Mrs Jenningss daughter and
her husband are traveling up

especially

ELINOR
Thank you Colonel we shall be
delighted

At that moment WILLOUGHBYs curricle hoves into view
MARIANNEs face lights up
COLONEL BRANDON
(to Marianne)
I will of course be including Mr
Willoughby in the party
Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects
manners She smiles kindly at BRANDON
MARIANNE
I should be delighted to join you
Colonel
The COLONEL helps her into the curricle exchanging
with WILLOUGHBY who is regarding him with some
WILLOUGHBY
Good morning Miss Dashwood good
morning Colonel
MARIANNE
The Colonel has invited us to
Delaford Willoughby
WILLOUGHBY
Excellent I understand you have a

particularly fine pianoforte Colonel

The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly

COLONEL BRANDON
A Broadwood Grand

MARIANNE
A Broadwood Grand Then I shall really
be able to play for you

WILLOUGHBY
We shall look forward to it

MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he
whips up
the horses They drive off waving their farewells

BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment and then
collects himself and turns to ELINOR who is less than
satisfied with their behaviour

COLONEL BRANDON
Your sister seems very happy

ELINOR
Yes Marianne does not approve of
hiding her emotions In fact her
romantic prejudices have the
unfortunate tendency to set propriety
at naught

COLONEL BRANDON
She is wholly unspoilt

ELINOR
Rather too unspoilt in my view The
sooner she becomes acquainted with
the ways of the world the better

COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks
very

deliberately as though controlling some powerful
emotion

COLONEL BRANDON
I knew a lady like your sister--the
same impulsive sweetness of temper--
who was forced into as you put it
a better acquaintance with the world
The result was only ruination and
despair

He stops and briskly remounts his horse

COLONEL BRANDON
Do not desire it Miss Dashwood
EXT BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY

People and carriages fill the drive the sun shines and

the
atmosphere is pleasantly expectant SIR JOHN is
organising
the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL
BRANDON
is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes There

stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-
looking
GIRL (LUCY STEELE) who are standing with ELINOR

MARGARET MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD
MARIANNE is standing slightly apart looking out along
the
road impatient for WILLOUGHBY
MRS JENNINGS
Imagine my surprise Mrs Dashwood
when Charlotte and her lord and master
appeared with our cousin Lucy The
last person I expected to see Where
did you pop out from Miss says I
I was never so surprised to see anyone
in all my life
LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground MRS
JENNINGS

continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD

MRS JENNINGS
She probably came on purpose to share
the fun for there are no funds for
such luxuries at home poor thing

LUCY
I had not seen you for so long dear
Mrs Jennings I could not resist the
opportunity

CHARLOTTE
Oh you sly thing It was the Misses
Dashwood she wanted to see not
Delaford Mamma I have heard nothing
but Miss Dashwood this Miss Dashwood
that for I dont know how long And
what do you think of them now you do
see them Lucy My mother has talked
of nothing else in her letters since
you came to Barton Mrs Dashwood Mr
Palmer--are they not the very
creatures she describes

MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted
expression

MR PALMER
Nothing like

CHARLOTTE

(laughing gaily)
Why Mr Palmer Do you know you are
quite rude today He is to be an MP
you know Mrs Dashwood and it is
very fatiguing for him for he is
forced to make everybody like him--
he says it is quite shocking--

MRS PALMER
I never said anything so irrational
Dont palm all your abuses of the
language upon me

MRS JENNINGS
(to Mrs Dashwood)
Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always
out of humour

MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under

siege
WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle MARIANNE
waves
to him with a radiant smile MRS JENNINGS nudges
CHARLOTTE
and points to MARIANNE
MRS JENNINGS
Here he is Now you shall see
Charlotte
WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible
making

her laugh

MRS JENNINGS
How now Mr Willoughby You must
greet my daughter Charlotte and Mr
Palmer--
WILLOUGHBY
How do you do

MRS JENNINGS
And my little cousin Miss Lucy
Steele

WILLOUGHBY
Welcome to our party Miss Steele

LUCY bobs demurely WILLOUGHBY inclines his head
politely

leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in MRS
JENNINGS

coos and chuckles at them CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR

CHARLOTTE
I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--
not that I ever spoke to him but I
have seen him forever in town Your
sister is monstrous lucky to get
him Mamma says Colonel Brandon is
in love with her as well which is a
very great compliment for he hardly
ever falls in love with anyone

ELINOR smiles politely WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle
out to

the front of the drive CHARLOTTE points after them and
laughs

with MRS JENNINGS LUCY edges up beside ELINOR

LUCY
May I beg a seat beside you Miss
Dashwood I have so longed to make
your better acquaintance I have
heard nothing but the highest praise
for you

ELINOR is relieved to change the subject

ELINOR
I would be delighted But Sir John
and Mrs Jennings are too excessive
in their compliments I am sure to
disappoint

LUCY
No for it was from quite another
source that I heard you praised and
one not at all inclined to
exaggeration

LUCY speaks in a knowing confidential undertone as

though
not wanting anyone else to hear At that moment a
HORSEMAN
thunders up the drive towards them Everyone turns to
face
the new arrival
SIR JOHN
What can this be
It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long hard
ride
He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter
which
BRANDON tears open MRS JENNINGS is puce with
suppressed
curiosity
COLONEL BRANDON
My horse Quickly
SIR JOHN
What is the matter Brandon
COLONEL BRANDON
I must away to London
SIR JOHN
No Impossible
Everyone gathers round BRANDON who is naturally
mortified
A SERVANT brings up the COLONELs horse
COLONEL BRANDON
Imperative
There is a murmur of disappointment from the party SIR
JOHN

is embarrassed and protests again

SIR JOHN
But Brandon we are all assembled
We cannot picnic at Delaford without
our host Go up to town tomorrow

WILLOUGHBY
Or wait till we return and start
then--you would not be six hours
later

COLONEL BRANDON
I cannot afford to lose one minute

As he speaks he is mounting his horse His grave

urgency
silences all protest and he gallops off leaving
everyone
stunned and of course deeply curious Then they all
start
to talk at once LUCY is still next to ELINOR
LUCY
Oh Miss Dashwood I cannot bear it
Just when I was to have the
opportunity of speaking with you
EXT MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY
Having been denied their trip the DASHWOODS and
WILLOUGHBY
have set out an impromptu picnic WILLOUGHBY is
wandering

restlessly about
The weather is sublime

WILLOUGHBY
Frailty thy name is Brandon

MARIANNE
There are some people who cannot
bear a party of pleasure I think he
wrote the letter himself as a trick
for getting out of it

MRS DASHWOOD
(indulgently)
You are a very wicked pair Colonel
Brandon will be sadly missed

WILLOUGHBY
Why When he is the kind of man that
everyone speaks well of and no one
wants to talk to

MARIANNE
Exactly

ELINOR
Nonsense
MRS DASHWOOD
Colonel Brandon is very highly
esteemed at the Park

WILLOUGHBY
Which is enough censure in itself

ELINOR
(half laughing)
Really Willoughby

WILLOUGHBY
(imitating Mrs Jennings
perfectly)
Come come Mr Impudence--I know you
and your wicked ways--oh

He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden

doing
her walk He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on
her
shoulder
WILLOUGHBY
Come Miss Dashwood reveal your
beau reveal him I say Lets have
no secrets between friends Let me
winkle them out of you
ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he
waddles

off to MARIANNE

WILLOUGHBY
(as Mrs Jennings)
I declare Miss Marianne if I do
not have you married to the Colonel
by teatime I shall swallow my own
bonnet

MARIANNE laughs WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly

WILLOUGHBY
As if you could marry such a
character

ELINOR

Why should you dislike him

There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBYs raillery He
flicks
MARIANNE to

her

MARGARET

them

from

ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps

her feet and starts to dance around the garden with

WILLOUGHBY

Because he has threatened me with
rain when I wanted it fine he has
found fault with the balance of my
curricle and I cannot persuade him
to buy my brown mare If it will be
of any satisfaction to you however
to be told I believe his character
to be in all other respects
irreproachable I am ready to confess
it And in return for an
acknowledgement that must give me
some pain

(he is slowing down)
You cannot deny me the privilege

(slower still)
of disliking him

(and stopping)
as much as I adore

He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other The
expression on WILLOUGHBYs face is heart-stopping

has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open
ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at
with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE
Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away
MARIANNE and gesturing to the house

WILLOUGHBY
--this cottage

The tension is broken MARGARET starts to chew again

MRS DASHWOOD
I have great plans for improvements
to it you know Mr Willoughby

WILLOUGHBY
Now that I will never consent to
Not a stone must be added to its
walls Were I rich enough I would
instantly pull down Combe Magna and
build it up again in the exact image
of that cottage

ELINOR
With dark narrow stairs a poky
hall and a fire that smokes

WILLOUGHBY
Especially the fire that smokes
Then I might be as happy at Combe
Magna as I have been at Barton

He looks at MARIANNE who has gone to sit at her

mothers
feet
WILLOUGHBY
But this place has one claim on my
affection which no other can possibly
share
MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks
like

an angel

WILLOUGHBY
Promise me you will never change it

MRS DASHWOOD
I do not have the heart

ELINOR
Or the money

sent--that is to say Lady Allen has
exercised the privilege of riches
upon a dependent cousin and is sending
me to London

He cannot look any of them in the eye

MRS DASHWOOD
When--this morning

WILLOUGHBY
Almost this moment

MRS DASHWOOD
How very disappointing But your
business will not detain you from us
for long I hope

WILLOUGHBY
You are very kind--but I have no
idea of returning immediately to
Devonshire I am seldom invited to
Allenham more than once a year

MRS DASHWOOD
For shame Willoughby Can you wait
for an invitation from Barton Cottage

WILLOUGHBY
My engagements at present are of
such a nature--that is--I dare not
flatter myself--

The atmosphere is thick with tension WILLOUGHBY flicks

a
glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute
astonishment

Nothing Please do not ask me
questions
MARIANNE struggles free
MARIANNE
Please let me be
She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door
slamming

There is a moment of stunned silence

ELINOR
They must have quarreled

MRS DASHWOOD
That is unlikely Perhaps this--Lady
Allen--disapproves of his regard for
Marianne and has invented an excuse
to send him away

ELINOR
Then why did he not say as much It
is not like Willoughby to be
secretive Did he think Marianne was
richer than she is

MRS DASHWOOD
How could he

She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with

a
frown
MRS DASHWOOD
What is it you suspect him of
ELINOR
I can hardly tell you But why was
his manner so guilty
MRS DASHWOOD
What are you saying Elinor That he
has been acting a part to your sister
for all this time
MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive ELINOR pauses to
think

ELINOR
No he loves her I am sure

MRS DASHWOOD
Of course he loves her

ELINOR
But has he left her with any assurance
of his return Cannot you ask her if
he has proposed

MRS DASHWOOD
Certainly not I cannot force a
confidence from Marianne and nor
must you We must trust her to confide
in us in her own time

ELINOR
(shaking her head)
There was something so underhand in
the manner of his leaving

MRS DASHWOOD
You are resolved then to think the
worst of him

ELINOR
Not resolved--

MRS DASHWOOD
(cold)
I prefer to give him the benefit of
my good opinion He deserves no less
From all of us

She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs

follows her

Mamma I am very fond of Willoughby--

MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door
ELINOR

is halfway up the stairs She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET
coming

down with a cup of tea

She would not let me in

MRS JENNINGS
Twas you took her off my hands Mr
Palmer and a very good bargain you
made of it too but now I have the
whip hand over you for you cannot
give her back

unhappy
truth of this statement

still

further so that ELINOR is obliged to move her chair
nearer

There is a particular question I
have long wanted to ask you but
perhaps you will think me impertinent

LUCY rises and takes ELINORs arm She guides her as

away as possible from MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE

ELINOR

I had no idea at all that you were

connected with that family
LUCY
Oh I am certainly nothing to Mrs
Ferrars at present--but the time may
come when we may be very intimately
connected

ELINOR

What do you mean Do you have an
understanding with Fannys brother
Robert

LUCY
The youngest No I never saw him in
my life No with Edward

LUCY
Edward and I have been secretly
engaged these five years

ELINOR is frozen to the spot

LUCY
You may well be surprised I should
never have mentioned it had I not
nown I could entirely trust you to
eep our secret Edward cannot mind
me telling you for he looks on you
quite as his own sister

ELINOR walks on mechanically Disbelief has set in

I was very unwilling to enter into

we loved each other with too great a
passion for prudence Though you do
nor know him so well as I Miss
Dashwood you must have seen how
capable he is of making a woman
sincerely attached to him I cannot
pretend it has not been very hard on
us both We can hardly meet above
twice a year

She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she

to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible

ELINOR seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has
dear moves quickly to a chair and sits down

LUCY
You seem out of sorts Miss Dashwood--
are you quite well

ELINOR
Perfectly well thank you

LUCY
I have not offended you

ELINOR
On the contrary

MRS JENNINGS has been watching Now she rises unable
contain herself
MRS JENNINGS
I can stand it no longer I must
know what you are saying Lucy Miss
Dashwood is quite engrossed

real urgency

Oh Miss Dashwood if anyone finds
out it will ruin him--you must not
tell a soul Edward says you would
not break your word to save your
life Promise me

we cannot possibly leave our mother

LUCYs calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with

Indeed the loss would be too great

A chorus of objections goes up particularly from MRS
DASHWOOD who is both delighted and relieved to see

My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss
to discover in what point I could be
so unfortunate as to offend you My
esteem for your family is very sincere
but if I have given rise to a belief
of more than I felt or meant to
express I shall reproach myself for
not having been more guarded My
affections have long been engaged
elsewhere and it is with great regret
that I return your letters and the
lock of hair which you so obligingly
bestowed upon me I am etc John

Oh Marianne
MARIANNE gives a great howl of pain and flings herself
across
the bed as though in physical agony

ELINOR
Marianne oh Marianne--it is better
to know at once what his intentions
are Dearest think of what you would
have felt if your engagement had
carried on for months and months
before he chose to put an end to it

MARIANNE
We are not engaged

ELINOR
But you wrote to him I thought then
that he must have left you with some
kind of understanding

MARIANNE
No--he is not so unworthy as you
think him

ELINOR
Not so unworthy Did he tell you
that he loved you

MARIANNE
Yes No--never absolutely It was
every day implied but never declared
Sometimes I thought it had been but
it never was He has broken no vow

ELINOR
He has broken faith with all of us
he made us all believe he loved you

MARIANNE
He did He did--he loved me as I
loved him

MRS JENNINGS bursts through the door in her hat and
coat
panting

MRS JENNINGS
I had to come straight up--how are
you Miss Marianne

MARIANNE begins to sob uncontrollably
MRS JENNINGS
Poor thing She looks very bad No
wonder Miss Dashwood for it is but
too true I was told here in the
street by Miss Morton who is a great
friend he is to be married at the
end of the month--to a Miss Grey
with fifty thousand pounds Well
said I if tis true then he is a
good-for-nothing who has used my
young friend abominably ill and I
wish with all my soul that his wife
may plague his heart out

She goes round the bed to comfort MARIANNE

MRS JENNINGS
But he is not the only young man
worth having my dear and with your
pretty face you will never want for
admirers

MARIANNE sobs even harder

MRS JENNINGS
Ah me She had better have her cry
out and have done with it I will go
and look out something to tempt her--
does she care for olives

ELINOR
I cannot tell you

MRS JENNINGS leaves MARIANNE seizes the letter again

MARIANNE
I cannot believe his nature capable
of such cruelty

ELINOR
Marianne there is no excuse for him--
this is his hand--

MARIANNE
But it cannot be his heart Oh Mamma
I want Mamma Elinor please take me
home Cannot we go tomorrow

ELINOR
There is no one to take us
MARIANNE
Cannot we hire a carriage

ELINOR
We have no money--and indeed we owe
Mrs Jennings more courtesy

All she wants is gossip and she only
likes me because I supply it Oh
God I cannot endure to stay

ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter There is a
rap at the front door Footsteps are heard and as she
the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON ELINOR rises to
him

ELINOR
Thank you for coming Colonel

He bows ELINOR is on edge BRANDON looks haggard with
concern

COLONEL BRANDON
How does your sister

ELINOR

I must get her home as quickly as
possible The Palmers can take us as
far as Cleveland which is but a day
from Barton--

COLONEL BRANDON
Then permit me to accompany you and
take you straight on from Cleveland
to Barton myself

ELINOR takes his hands gratefully
ELINOR
I confess that is precisely what I
had hoped for Marianne suffers
cruelly and what pains me most is
how hard she tries to justify Mr
Willoughby But you know her
disposition

After a moment BRANDON nods He seems unable to remain
still
or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking

COLONEL BRANDON
Perhaps I--my regard for you all--
Miss Dashwood will you allow me to
prove it by relating some
circumstances which nothing but an
earnest desire of being useful--

ELINOR
You have something to tell me of Mr
Willoughby
COLONEL BRANDON
(nods)

When I quitted Barton last--but I

must go further back A short account
of myself will be necessary No
doubt no doubt Mrs Jennings has
apprised you of certain events in my
past--the sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza

ELINOR nods

COLONEL BRANDON
What is not commonly known is that
twenty years ago Eliza bore an
illegitimate child The father
whoever he was abandoned them

This is strong stuff ELINORs concern deepens

COLONEL BRANDON
As she lay dying she begged me to
look after the child Eliza died in
my arms broken wasted away--ah
Miss Dashwood such a subject--
untouched for so many years--it is
dangerous

He paces about barely able to conceal his distress
shocked

COLONEL BRANDON
I had failed Eliza in every other
way--I could not refuse her now I
took the child--Beth is her name--
and placed her with a family where I
could be sure she would be well looked
after I saw her whenever I could I
saw that she was headstrong like her
mother--and God forgive me I
indulged her I allowed her too much
freedom Almost a year ago she
disappeared

ELINOR
Disappeared

COLONEL BRANDON

I instigated a search but for eight
months I was left to imagine the
worst At last on the day of the
Delaford picnic I received the first
news her She was with child and
the blackguard who had--

BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR

ELINOR
Good God Do you mean--Willoughby

BRANDON nods ELINOR drops into a chair utterly

COLONEL BRANDON
Before I could return to confront
him Lady Allen learned of his
behaviour and turned him from the
house He beat a hasty retreat to
London--

ELINOR
Yes He left us that morning without
any explanation

COLONEL BRANDON
Lady Allen had annulled his legacy
He was left with next to nothing
and in danger of losing all that
remained to his debtors--

ELINOR
--and so abandoned Marianne for Miss
Grey and her fifty thousand pounds
BRANDON is silent ELINOR is breathless

ELINOR
Have you seen Mr Willoughby since
you learned

BRANDON
(nodding)
We met by appointment he to defend
I to punish his conduct

ELINOR stares at him aghast

BRANDON
We returned unwounded so the meeting
never got abroad

ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment

ELINOR
Is Beth still in town

COLONEL BRANDON
She has chosen to go into the country
for her confinement Such has been
the unhappy resemblance between the
fate of mother and daughter and so
imperfectly have I discharged my
trust

A pause

COLONEL BRANDON
I would not have burdened you Miss
Dashwood had I not from my heart
believed it might in time lessen
your sisters regrets

BRANDON moves to the door and then stops He turns to

her
and speaks with effort

COLONEL BRANDON

I have described Mr Willoughby as
the worst of libertines--but I have
since learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day
Therefore I cannot deny that his
intentions towards Marianne were
honourable and I feel certain he
ELINOR is

MRS

as

her

would have married her had it not
been for--for the money

She looks up at BRANDON Silence

INT MRS JENNINGSS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space
kneeling by her holding her hands

ELINOR
Dearest was I right to tell you

MARIANNE
Of course

ELINOR
Whatever his past actions whatever
his present course at least you may
be certain that he loved you

MARIANNE
But not enough Not enough

INT MRS JENNINGSS HOUSE - STUDY - DAY
ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands Suddenly
JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased

MRS JENNINGS
Here is someone to cheer you up
Miss Dashwood

She is followed in by LUCY MRS JENNINGS leaves busy
ever LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on

face

LUCY
How is your dear sister Miss
Dashwood Poor thing I must say I
do not know what I should do if a
man treated me with so little respect

ELINOR
I hope you are enjoying your stay

with John and Fanny Miss Steele

LUCY
again
LUCY

ELINOR

He

I was never so happy in my entire
life Miss Dashwood I do believe
your sister-in-law has taken quite a
fancy to me I had to come and tell
you--for you cannot imagine what has
happened

ELINOR
No I cannot

LUCY
Yesterday I was introduced to Edwards
mother

ELINOR
Indeed

LUCY

And she was a vast deal more than
civil I have not yet seen Edward
but now I feel sure to very soon--

The MAID comes back

MAID
Theres a Mr Edward Ferrars to see
you Miss Dashwood

There is a tiny frozen silence

ELINOR
Do ask him to come up

ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up
EDWARD is admitted looking both anxious and eager As
is sitting in the window seat at first he sees only
EDWARD
Miss Dashwood how can I--

But ELINOR cuts him off

ELINOR
Mr Ferrars what a pleasure to see
you You know Miss Steele of

course

EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCYs glassy smile

smile

MARIANNE

forgets

all but blanches Then bows and clears his throat

EDWARD
How do you do Miss Steele

LUCY
I am well thank you Mr Ferrars

EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say He swallows

ELINOR
Do sit down Mr Ferrars

LUCYs eyes are sharp as broken glass EDWARD remains
feet looking helplessly from one woman to the other

LUCY
You must be surprised to find me
here Mr Ferrars I expect you thought
I was at your sisters house

This is precisely what EDWARD had thought He tries to
but his facial muscles wont work ELINOR decides to
help

ELINOR
Let me call Marianne Mr Ferrars
She would be most disappointed to
miss you

ELINOR goes to the door thankful to escape but

prevents her by walking in at that moment Despite her
anguish she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces

warmly

MARIANNE
Edward I heard your voice At last
you have found us

EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily
his own confusion
EDWARD
Forgive me Marianne my visit is

shamefully overdue You are pale I
hope you have not been unwell
MARIANNE
Oh dont think of me--Elinor is
well you see that must be enough
for both of us

MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD
seems
unable to look at her

EDWARD
How do you like London Marianne

MARIANNE
Not at all The sight of you is all
the pleasure it has afforded is
that not so Elinor

Again MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers ELINOR
tries

to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail
MARIANNE

puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY at
whom

she glances with a none too friendly air

MARIANNE
Why have you taken so long to come
and see us

EDWARD
I have been much engaged elsewhere

MARIANNE
Engaged elsewhere But what was that
when there were such friends to be
met

LUCY
Perhaps Miss Marianne you think
young men never honour their
engagements little or great

ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not
notice
it and turns back to LUCY earnestly

MARIANNE
No indeed--for Edward is the most
fearful of giving pain and the most
incapable of being selfish of anyone
I ever saw
EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise

MARIANNE
Edward will you not sit Elinor
help me to persuade him

Now EDWARD can stand it no longer

EDWARD
Forgive me but I must take my leave--

MARIANNE
But you are only just arrived

ELINOR rises desperate for them both to go

EDWARD
You must excuse me I have a
commission to attend to for Fanny--

LUCY jumps in like a shot

LUCY
In that case perhaps you might escort
me back to your sisters house Mr
Ferrars

There is an extremely awkward pause

EDWARD
I would be honoured Goodbye Miss
Dashwood Miss Marianne

He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE who is

silent

with dismay LUCY takes EDWARDs arm and looks up at
him

proprietorially

After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD
they

leave MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment

MARIANNE
Why did you not urge him to stay

ELINOR
He must have had his reasons for
going

MARIANNE
His reason was no doubt your coldness
If I were Edward I would assume you
did not care for me at all

EXT JOHN AND FANNYS TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY
A tranquil afternoon
INT JOHN AND FANNYS TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

LUCY is sitting with FANNY who is doing some pointless
basketwork LUCY hands FANNY rushes

LUCY
Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly
tother day When I think of her
deserted and abandoned it frightens
me to think I shall never marry

FANNY
Nonsense You will marry far better
than either of the Dashwood girls

LUCY
How can that possibly be

FANNY
You have ten times their sense and
looks

LUCY

But I have no dowry

FANNY
There are qualities which will always
make up for that and you have them
in abundance It would not surprise
me if you were to marry far and away
beyond your expectations

LUCY
I wish it might be so There is a
young man--

FANNY
Ah ha I am glad to hear of it Is
he of good breeding and fortune

LUCY
Oh both--but his family would
certainly oppose the match
silence

and
grip and

arms

will

FANNY
Tush They will allow it as soon as
they see you my dear

LUCY
It is a very great secret I have
told no one in the world for fear of
discovery

FANNY looks up curious to know more

FANNY
My dear I am the soul of discretion

LUCY
If I dared tell

FANNY
I can assure you I am as silent as
the grave
LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNYs ear

MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps
INT MRS JENNINGSS HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing Their mood is gloomy
and

uncommunicative MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room
fighting

for breath

MRS JENNINGS
Oh my dears What a commotion Mr
Edward Ferrars--the very one I used
to joke you about Miss Dashwood--
has been engaged these five years to
Lucy Steele

MARIANNE lets out a gasp She looks at ELINOR who nods
at
her in swift confirmation

MRS JENNINGS
Poor Mr Ferrars His mother who by
all accounts is very proud demanded
that he break the engagement on pain
of disinheritance But he has refused
to break his promise to Lucy He has
stood by her good man and is cut
off without a penny She has settled
it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert
But I cannot stop I must go to Lucy
Your sister-in-law scolded her like
any fury--drove her to hysterics

She leaves the room still rabbiting on There is a
silence

MARIANNE
How long have you known

ELINOR
Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered
to take us to London

MARIANNE
Why did you not tell me

ELINOR
Lucy told me in the strictest
confidence

MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity

ELINOR
I could not break my word
Clearly there is no arguing this point

MARIANNE
But Edward loves you

ELINOR
He made me no promises He tried to
tell me about Lucy

MARIANNE
He cannot marry her

ELINOR
Would you have him treat her even
worse than Willoughby has treated
you

MARIANNE
No--but nor would I have him marry
where he does not love

ELINOR tries hard to be controlled

ELINOR
Edward made his promise a long time
ago long before he met me Though
he may harbour some regret I
believe he will be happy--in the
knowledge that he did his duty and
kept his word After all--after all
that is bewitching in the idea of
ones happiness depending entirely
on one person it is not always
possible We must accept Edward
will marry Lucy--and you and I will
go home

MARIANNE
Always resignation and acceptance
Always prudence and honour and duty
Elinor where is your heart

ELINOR finally explodes She turns upon MARIANNE almost
savagely

ELINOR
What do you know of my heart What
do you know of anything but your own
suffering For weeks Marianne I
have had this pressing on me without
being at liberty to speak of it toa
single creature It was forced upon
me by the very person whose prior
claims ruined all my hopes I have
had to endure her exultation again
and again while knowing myself to be
divided from Edward forever Believe
me Marianne had I not been bound
to silence I could have produced
proof enough of a broken heart even
for you

Complete silence Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper

MARIANNE
Oh Elinor

MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around

ELINOR
who almost impatiently tries to comfort her

I have heard that your friend Mr
Ferrars has been entirely cast off
by his family for persevering in his
engagement to Miss Steele
EXT SQUARE IN FRONT OF MRS JENNINGSS HOUSE - LONDON -
DAY

ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square

COLONEL BRANDON
Have I been rightly informed Is it
so

ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query
ELINOR

It is indeed so Are you acquainted
with Mr Ferrars
COLONEL BRANDON
No we have never met But I know
only too well the cruelty--the
impolitic cruelty of dividing two
young people long attached to one
another Mrs Ferrars does not know
what she may drive her son to--

He pauses frowning in remembrance ELINOR waits in
suspense

COLONEL BRANDON
I have a proposal to make that should
enable him to marry Miss Steele
immediately Since the gentleman is
so close a friend to your family
perhaps you will be good enough to
mention it to him

ELINOR is completely taken aback She takes a moment to
reply

ELINOR
Colonel I am sure he would be only
too delighted to hear it from your
own lips

COLONEL BRANDON
I think not His behaviour has proved
him proud--in the best sense I feel
certain this is the right course

INT MRS JENNINGSS HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

ELINOR is waiting The MAID announces EDWARD and he
walks in

momentarily They are alone for the first time in
months and

for a moment neither speaks

ELINOR

ELINOR indicates a seat for him but neither sits
ELINOR

Thank you for responding so promptly
to my message
EDWARD
I was most grateful to receive it I--
Miss Dashwood God knows what you
must think of me

ELINOR
Mr Ferrars--

He interrupts her desperate to explain

EDWARD
I have no right to speak I know--

ELINOR has to stop him

ELINOR
Mr Ferrars I have good news I think
you know of our friend Colonel
Brandon

EDWARD looks completely bewildered

EDWARD
Yes I have heard his name

ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual

ELINOR

Colonel Brandon desires me to say
that understanding you wish to join
the clergy he has great pleasure in
offering you the parish on his estate
at Delaford now just vacant in the
hope that it may enable you--and

Miss Steele--to marry

EDWARD cannot at first take it in ELINOR sits down

EDWARD
Colonel Brandon

ELINOR
Yes He means it as testimony of his
concern for--for the cruel situation
in which you find yourselves

Now EDWARD sits--in shock

EDWARD
Colonel Brandon give me a parish
Can it be possible
in the

an

that

silent

ELINOR
The unkindness of your family has
made you astonished to find friendship
elsewhere

EDWARD looks at ELINOR his eyes full of growing
comprehension

EDWARD
No Not to find it in you I cannot
be ignorant that to you--to your
goodness--I owe it all I feel it I
would express it if I could but as
you know I am no orator

ELINOR

You are very much mistaken I assure

you that you owe it almost entirely

to your own merit--I have had no

hand in it
But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental
offer He frowns slightly before speaking with rather
effort

EDWARD
Colonel Brandon must be a man of
great worth and respect ability

ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing
she truly means

ELINOR
He is the kindest and best of men

This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed He sits
for a moment but then rouses himself to action
EDWARD

May I enquire why the Colonel did
not tell me himself

ELINOR
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend

EDWARD looks at ELINOR his eyes full of sadness
EDWARD
Your friendship has been the most
important of my life

ELINOR
You will always have it

EDWARD
Forgive me

ELINOR
Mr Ferrars you honour your promises--
that is more important than anything
else I wish you--both--very happy

There I fell and there I first saw

ELINOR
Poor Willoughby He will always regret
you

MARIANNE

But does it follow that had he chosen
me he would have been content
ELINOR looks at MARIANNE surprised

MARIANNE
He would have had a wife he loved
but no money--and might soon have
learned to rank the demands of his
pocket-book far above the demands of
his heart

ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly MARIANNE smiles
sadly

MARIANNE
If his present regrets are half as
painful as mine he will suffer
enough

ELINOR
Do you compare your conduct with
his

MARIANNE
No I compare it with what it ought
to have been I compare it with yours

ELINOR
Our situations were very different

MARIANNE
My illness has made me consider the
past I saw in my own behaviour
nothing but imprudence--and worse I
was insolent and unjust to everyone--

ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues

MARIANNE
--but you--you I wronged above all
Only I knew your heart and its sorrows
but even then I was never a grain
