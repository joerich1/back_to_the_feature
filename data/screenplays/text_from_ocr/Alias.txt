OVER BLACK WE HEAR

A vapid erratic HEARTBEAT Instinctively we react to
this The scariest sound in the world It’s the sound of
fear

CLOSE-UP of a WOMANS FACE

In SLOW MOTION -- she’s scared to death eyes wide looking
right at us Her DYED RED HAIR an ethereal aura because
shes wnderwater -- being held underwater

We study the fear in her eyes - more than fear actually
it’s shock Shock at the certainty that she’s about to
die

This is SYDNEY’ BRISTOW 26 and unless things turn around
real soon the world’s about to lose a hero

Then a MUFFLED SOUND can be HEARD MEN YELLING Not
English Then a RUSH of SOUND -- like an approaching ROAR -
- and we go to REGULAR MOTION and the WAVE OF SOUND COMES

TO A CRESCENDO as Sydney’s head is PULLED out of the water
to find were in

INT JANITORIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A dark room -- this is all shot LONG™LENS -- it’s hard at
first to tell where we are whats happening -- but one
thing’s for sure

Sydney is GASPING FOR AIR desperate for life -- a GUARD
holding her tightly by her hair -- he’s one of two men that
are here

Theyre GUARDS -- Taiwanese -- and theyre angry and scary
as hell as the one holding her YANKS HER BACK intoa metal
chair her chest heaving eyes closed tight --

The other Guard YELLS at her in MANDARIN close to her
face There are NO SUBTITLES

As he yells the other Guard punctuates the tirade with his

own abusive demands -- their yelling OVERLAPPING - then
the Guard holding her THROWS HER TO THE CEMENT FLOOR

oa

and we can see where we are now A janitorial supply room -
- mops brooms chemicals -- all labels in Chinese and
Taiwanese -- chipped paint on the walls and a deep metal
SINK currently being used to torture an American woman

On the cold floor Sydney dressed in tight black clothes
looking for all the world like a cat burglar gasps for
air just trying to recover --

When one of the Guards grabs her hair again -- demands in
Mandarin --

And then Sydney responds -- also in Mandarin What’s most
surprising is not how well she speaks -- as fluent as a
native of the country -- it’s that despite her panic she
gives her non-subtitled explanation with absolute bravery
and confidence

And they don’t buy a word of it The Guard drags her by
her hair -- we TRACK with her on the floor and she’s thrown

back into the chair -- the Guard SLAPS HER FACE HARD --

CLOSE ON Sydney as she winces in pain from the impact face
red --

-- then the SOUND of KEYS -- at the door -- and she looks
up thedoor UNLOCKING -- her eyes trained on the door her
mind racing -- who could that be And then finally ©
something peculiar happens

A harmless-looking Caucasian OLD MAN enters and it just
takes a beat to realize that we’re now in

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

-- a large university classroom Wood brick stone -- a
warm wonderful place Sunlight pours into the atmosphere-
thick room through giant windows tops of palm trees
peeking over the sills

There are a hundred desk-chairs here only a dozen still
occupied by GRAD STUDENTS all final-proofing their blue
book tests oe

Is this a flashback A flash-forward All answers in
time But meanwhile

As the Old Man (PROFESSOR MIZZY) walks past these students
they finally relinquish their exams to him

Then Mizzy gets to the last student A frantically-

writing cozily-dressed SYDNEY BRISTOW Her hair is LONGER
now in its NATURAL DARK COLOR -

Mizzy stands there for a minute Sydney knows he’s
there but she needs to get this out

MIZZY
Sydney ‘

SYDNEY
(not looking up writing fast
completely casual)
Yeah

MIZ2Y
Times up

SYDNEY
(finishing as she talks
purposely slowly)
Okay then I‘ll just
turn in my little
(the last words)
essay thank you

Mizzy takes the blue book and walks off Sydney watches
him go unconsciously biting her lip -- dread washing over
her face

SYDNEY (VO) (CONTD)
So I’m pretty sure I got a “D”

EXT UCLA CAMPUS - DAY

SYDNEY and DANNY 28 walk across the campus lawn
backpacks slung over shoulders Danny’s in scrubs and long
white coat on hospital break Handsome and low-key he
seems a bit preoccupied Despite her current concern
Sydney walks with a real bounce in her step

DANNY
You didn‘t get a “D”

SYDNEY
I think I got a “D” I think I got
like a sixty four maybe

DANNY
Syd youve never gotten a “D”
SYDNEY
Oh I’ve gotten a “D”
DANNY
Oh yeah Home Ec -- can we talk about

something For a second

SYDNEY
I told you about Home Ec Well that
was different that grade I deserved

DANNY
What’d you do Embroider something on
a sweatshirt

SYDNEY
That was the assignment
DANNY
But it was obscene right About the
teacher
SYDNEY

I said I deserved that grade -- and
you know what I deserve whatever I
get in Mizzy’s class-- I wasn’t

DANNY

So maybe you should quit this part-
time thing Take a leave of absence
from the bank- can I change the
subject for a second

SYDNEY
Sure what

As he goes through his backpack she watches Waits She
loves this guy

DANNY
I can’t go through double-shift again
holding onto this

He pulls out something she can’t see He gets on his
knees Then she drops to her knees Smiles at him
touched

SYDNEY -
Did you get the Dave Matthews tickets

DANNY
(annoyed)
Will you stand up please I’m trying
to do something here

She stands confused He looks up at her for a long beat

DANNY (CONT’D)
I was gonna wait do it this
weekend

SYDNEY
(it slowly dawning on her)
Danny what’s going on

DANNY
Just remember our firstdate The
bowling alley The bald guy

SYDNEY
(shocked)
mo

Then embracing the insanity of the moment but committing
to the act fully Danny begins SINGING “Build Me Up
Buttercup” to Sydney right there in the middle of the
campus green at the top of his lungs
Sydney tears welling in her eyes LAUGHS loving him so
much -- and we love him too now how can we not

Passing Students can’t help but look Some confused —
ethers getting it and loving it too Danny finishes the
chorus

DANNY
“ don’t break my heart”

- and he holds out an open RING BOX It’s a modest
antique ring -Sydney’s practically crying as Danny says
quietly sweetly

DANNY (CONT’D)
I can’t tell you how much I hope
youll marry me
(beat)
Despite what I just did

And she’s looking at him a tear streaks down her cheek -
she‘s sort of stunned and thrilled and nervous for reasons

we couldn’t possibly understand yet He looks up at her

waiting Finally some concern starts to wash across his
ace

DANNY (CONTD)
Are you gonna respond

And she drops to her knees takes his face in her hands --
and says quietly sweetly

fl

SYDNEY
Yes

INT SYDNEY’S APARTMENT - DAY
‘PRANCIE Sydneys best friend 26 stands in the apartment

doorway ogling Sydney’s engagement-ringed hand Sydney is
dressed in a sophisticated but understated dark suit

FRANCIE
No
SYDNEY ©
(beaming)
Yes
FRANCIE

(eyes on ring)
Okay we love him

SYDNEY
Isn’t it pretty

FRANCIE
(beat heartfelt)
Roney

And Francie gives Sydney a long hug Francie starts to
cry
SYDNEY
Oh Fran
FRANCIE
I know I cry at everything I’m such
a maudlin freak-
(sniffles forces tears away)

Willie’s never given me anything close
to- is this an antique

SYDNEY
It was his grandmothers

FRANCIE
God bless you Okay so tell me how
he did it I need all the details
otherwise I’m gonna have to make stuff
up and tell people my version

SYDNEY
He got on one knee-- 5 Sang to me

FRANCIE
(more than touched)
He sang to you

SYDNEY
Youre not gonna believe this - he
called my dad to ask permission

Sydney said that last line looking at her shoes as she put
them on -- throwing it away as much as she could Which
doesn’t work with a friend like Francie

FRANCIE
He called your dad Your dad

SYDNEY
(casual)
Uh-huh

FRANCIE
(freaked for a moment
borderline disgusted)
and how the hell did that go

ON SYDNEY for a moment who--is clearly an amazing actress
she looks like she’s trying to find the word “Flawlessly”
But finally gives in with

SYDNEY
Not well

INT UCLA HOSPITAL - DAY

PUSH IN ON Danny at a pay phone receiver to his ear
tense We HEAR a RINGING
a
MAN’S VOICE (V0O)
(on phone brusque)
Yeah

DANNY
Mr Bristow

INTERCUT WITH
INT JACK BRISTOW’S OFFICE - DAY

The sort of plain-wrapper office that denies the visitor
any indication as to the personality of its occupant And
there on the phone is dark-suited JACK BRISTOW 50
tries to pA one word comes to mind ordinary A beat as he

ries to place the voice

)

JACK
yes
DANNY
Hi it’s Danny Hecht Sydney’s
boyfriend--
JACK

(with some concern)
Is Sydney all right

DANNY
Oh yeah she’s great Nothing to
worry about Well unless-- anyway
I’m calling because I uh I‘m
planning on asking Sydney to marry me
And I was hoping to get your
approval

Jack takes a beat Isn’t amused Isn’t anything it
seems Even alone this guy’s guarded as hell Finally

fl

JACK
Danny let me ask you a question
DANNY
sure
JACK

How well do you know my daughter

DANNY
(thrown for a beat) -
Uh weve been dating for two years

JACK
Because if you feel the need to ask me
about this scenario I have a sense
you don’t know Sydney at all

DANNY
Sir I love your daughter and I want
to marry her that’s why I’m calling

JACK

First of all Danny the truth is
this is just a courtesy call Like
when you say to your neighbor “Were
having a loud party on Saturday night
if that’s all right with you” What
you really mean is “Were having a
loud party on Saturday night”

( )

DANNY
Mr Bristow--

JACK
Sydney doesn’t care what my opinion
is What interests me is that you do

DANNY
It’s just a custom to call the
father that’s all this is--

JACK
Well then Ill tell you what IJ may
become your father-in-law and that’s
just fine But I will not be usedas
part of a charming little anecdote you
tell your friends at cocktail parties
so they can see what a quaint old-
fashioned guy Danny really is

(beat)

Are we clear

DANNY
hating him)
yessir

JACK
Good Then welcome to the family

Jack hangs up And we’re ON DANNY who’s just poleaxed
INT SYDNEY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Sydney drinks Evian as Francie looks in the mostly-empty
fridge

SYDNEY
I’m not gonna put up with it My dad
being a jerk to Danny

FRANCIE
-Just please don’t waste your time
talking to him again hell just start
yapping about importing airplane parts
-- could the contents of your fridge
be any more pathetic

SYDNEY
It’s exporting airplane parts And I
know youre right
(beat)
I havén’t even called him yet And
there’s cheese in there -

FRANCIE
What about Clay

SYDNEY
I’m meeting him at the track after the
bank if you wanna come

FRANCIE

‘I’ve got three hundred orthopedic

surgeons to feed tonight And also no
desire to exercise ever Let Clay
down gently

SYDNEY
Francie

FRANCIE
Don’t play dumb you know what I mean

SYDNEY
My telling Clay I’m engaged doesn’t
require anyone letting anyone else
‘down ”

FRANCIE
Syd My blind sad friend Syd
SYDNEY
What has Clay said to you
FRANCIE
Nothing he doesn‘t have to--
SYDNEY
He and I are very dear friends
FRANCIE
Yes true -- he however lives with a

constant desperate hope like a
person with a terminal disease that
one day things will turn around for
him -

SYDNEY
No It’s simple you’re wrong Which
has happened before

As they head out

FRANCIE
Fine By theway Im not catering
your wedding

1l

SYDNEY
You can’t cater my wedding and be in
it-- oh my God I didn’t even ask you -
you’re my maid of honor Okay

FRANCIE
(tearing up)
Oh my God I’m crying again -- yes
Yes

Sydney LAUGHS as Francie hugs her --
EXT DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

MUSIC PLAYS -- a low-register synth sequence -- dark
swirling rhythm -- a sampled trip-hop drum loop -- and we
CIRCLE one of many shimmering office towers -- as we
DESCEND to street level --

-- and find Sydney heading for the entrance Before she
gets there she pulls off her engagement ring and pockets
it Then she heads in to

INT CREDIT DAUPHINE - DAY

The flagship branch of the French international bank
Sydney moves across the floor smiling at one or two
Workers at their desks

The MUSIC GROOVES as she moves to the main vault where the
two- foot thick door is open the metal-barred door closed
and locked An armed GUARD stands watch As Sydney
casually enters a series of numbers on a keypad she smiles
at the Guard

SYDNEY
Theo feeling better

GUARD
Much thanks for asking

And with a metallic CLANG the barred door unlocks Sydney
enters--

INT VAULT - DAY
Sydney moves through the vault arrives at the safety

deposit door also sealed She enters another series of
numbers and that door unlocks Sydney enters--

INT SAFETY DEPOSIT AREA - DAY

And the MUSIC becomes just a rhythmic SHAKER SOUND as
Sydney unseen and alone moves through the safety deposit
room - past rows of locked boxes She moves to a far
corner pulls out TWO KEYS And in an act she’s done
countless times she inserts each into a different box lock
-- turns them simultaneously --

Another deposit box opens -- she pulls it out -- it’s a
retina reader Sydney’s eyeball gets read by a laser
scanner and --

The MUSIC BASS LINE RETURNS as we see the section of the
floor she’s on BEGIN TO DESCEND FROM VIEW -- she and the
surrounding deposit boxes lower down to a secret floor
The whole section is replaced by an identical corner unit
from above

Within moments the vault is empty
INT AGENCY ENTRANCE CORRIDOR - DAY

What follows will and should raise countless questions
where exactly are we What is this place This is
intentional

The only clue AMERICAN FLAGS constantly visible

Sydney walks down a wildly long low-ceilinged corridor
dotted with closed numbered office doors -- at the end of
which is the vault section that just descended Miles of
multi-colored CABLE runs along the ceiling this place is
an information hub

The carpet grey the walls white the lighting fluorescent -
- giving this whole space a sickly inhuman glow A marked
contrast to the warmth of the rest of Sydneys life

She passes a dark-suited male Agent walking the other
direction wearing glasses and reading from a file They
nod to each other in greeting Then she turns at an
intersection and enters

INT AGENCY TASKING OFFICE - DAY

Endless cubicles the walls of which are all below sitting
eye-level Phone headset-wearing AGENTS stare intently at
their flat-screens gathering retrieving deciphering and
analyzing data

Although people personalize what they Wear with a colorful
shirt or necktie the dress code here Ls dark suits

Sydney walks swiftly down the cubicle alleys arriving at
AGENT LARRY HIRSCHs desk Hes 45 currently talking into
his headset ending an endless call in perfect Hebrew

HIRSCH

(in Hebrew)
-- fine like I said call me at this
number when you return from Kufrinjah
well set up a meeting with Jibril
Goodbye

(hits “hang up” then in

English to Sydney)
God I hate this thing

SYDNEY
(I know what you mean)
I was just saying if only Ramadan
Abadallah Shallah were still teaching
in Tampa
HIRSCH
(rips off headset)
Oh I‘m not talking about my casework -

- these new headsets -- they don’t
pinch your ear Like right here

Sydney swipes his headset and the scissors off his desk
and as she SNIPS OFF a section of the ear clip wire

SYDNEY
We‘re late ya know

HIRSCH
We still have thirty seconds
(examines his adjusted
headset)
Hey cool thanks

INT AGENCY DEBRIEFING ROOM - DAY

MUSIC STOPS AS WE DOLLY AROUND the conference table in the
darkened room as Sydney and Hirsch are addressed by 50 year-
old branch director ARVIN SLOANE Another dark suit He
wears glasses which reflect the images displayed on the
wall-mounted flat-screen monitor Currently a black and
white MUG SHOT of a 40ish ragged-looking MAN

The other guy sitting here is MARSHALL Oddly he’s a
mess Scraggly facial hair and a millet cut He wears a
vest over an old black Motley Crew T-shirt rounded by his
pot belly He just sits there checked out )

i

SLOANE
Oskar Kunther was killed last month
He was riding a moped through Berlin
hit by an ambulance of all things
We‘d had our eyes on this guy for a
while his was recorded as one of the
highest IQs on the planet

HIRSCH
Then again he was riding a moped

Sloane advances to the next few images police photos of a
ransacked apartment

SLOANE
As you can imagine there was a multi-
national frenzy to recover Kunther’s
notebooks and experiments None were
found not by the West

The next image a SATELLITE PHOTO of a Taipei government
building
SLOANE (CONTD)

Cultural Affairs building in Taipei

Hsincheng North Road section two

Its also an FTL cover station We

received word two weeks ago that one

of Kunther’s plans surfaced here

SYDNEY
Whos the mole

SLOANE
Antonio Quintero This was his last
transmission

Next image it’s a black and white low-res photo of a hand-
drawn construction plan -- on parchment in ink A plan to
build a wild-looking da Vinei-style machine -- if da Vinci
had skipped through MIT The writing on the plan is
wildly foreign

SLOANE (CONTD)
Uplink was on the fifteenth There
was a brush pass scheduled for
Tuesday but Quintero didn’t show

SYDNEY

(re image)
What is that hieratic

15

SLOANE
Demotic Taking notes in ancient
languages was just one of Kunther’s
quirks apparently he had a few

HIRSCH
So Quintero’s been burned

SLOANE
We don’t know The Cultural
Ambassador is throwing a reception for
Western investors at the building’s
annex next Tuesday

Sloane hands Sydney and Hirsch string-tied ENVELOPES As
they open them pulling out passports and IDs

Sloane (cont’d)
You fly to Taiwan Monday night
Youre employed by Modira Plastics

HIRSCH -
(reading red-paper document)
looking for a new manufacturing
plant

SLOANE
Quintero suspected the building’s east
wing Your job is to case that area
measurements lock specs IO the
nine yards You’ll locate the lab
where Kunther’s plans are being held
and come home But that’s all no
retrieval we can’t risk it

Sloane nods to Marshall who comes to life Relatively
speaking When he moves it’s slow and when he speaks
it’s without much force He’s sort of an idiot savant

The overall impression is that his brain’s fried from years
of severe drug use

Marshall slides over what looks like a shellacked wooden
cigar box Flips it open Two foam-encased items a
lipstick and a cigarette lighter Sloane pulls out the
lighter opens it reveals a TOGGLE SWITCH

MARSHALL
Okay so this is pretty cool It’s an
RF scrambler okay Disables ail
video signals for like a five
hundred yard radius

Marshall hits the switch -- the flat screen goes SCRAMBLED

16

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
(smiles)
Everyone on the block’s freaking out
right now

Sloane reaches over casually flicks the toggle The image
of the plan returns on the monitor

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
To keep it this size I had to use a
twenty-volt cell okay Which means
you get like four minutes a charge
so don’t like take your time okay

Marshall pulls out the lipstick Removes the cap reveals
two tiny LENSES He loves this one

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Okay this is the best lipstick Ive
ever made I’m pretty sure measures
space in three axes from one vantage”
point okay This lens projects a
grid this one analyzes the throw
You got three gigs in there which can
hold like five thousand snaps

SYDNEY
Thats good work

MARSHALL
(looks away blushes)
Thanks Agent Bristow

SLOANE
This might seem like a simple
reconnaissance op but keep your

eyes peeled Per usual your lives
are at risk

And we PUSH IN on Sydney considering this thinking
suddenly about Danny and how she can reconcile keeping
this world a-secret from him PUSHING IN on her face we
HEAR BREATHING -- HEAVY BREATHING -- the sound-of someone
RUNNING -- SMASHCUT TO

SYDNEY -- RUNNING

We cant tell where we are but it’s daytime and she’s
SPRINTING HARD -- and finally when her run is over we
realize we’re

EXT UCLA TRACK - DAY

Sydney completes her run with CLAY GIBBONS her good-
looking “guy friend” He almost asked Sydney out years
earlier but didn’t A week later she met Damny His
lifelong regret Suffice it to say Francie was right
about this guy

Both are wildly out of breath They walk it off near the
sprint track where a couple of Runners practice hurdles

Clay picks up a bottle of water offers it to Sydney first

SYDNEY
Thanks

And she swigs Then offers it to him He drinks

SYDNEY (CONTD)
Hey where were you last night I
called you

CLAY
Oh yeah I don’t wanna talk about
it

date

SYDNEY

A silence Clay’s stunned It takes a beat to sink in

ring God I didn’t even-- Syd

Clay turns and runs off We HOLD ON Sydney watching him
go SLOWLY PUSH IN on her her concern for this
friendship crystal clear And BETH ORTON starts to SING as
we CUT TO

INSERT - DEMOTIC WRITING
In a textbook on ancient Egyptian languages And we’re in
INT SYDNEY’S APARTMENT - DAY -

The MUSIC coming from the stereo Sydney wearing
Sweatpants and a t-shirt sits cross-legged on her bed
surrounded by college books She just happens to be
reading up on Demotic She looks up to Danny who sits on
the floor reading a medical textbook

She watches him for a beat so in love but so
concerned Then as if he felt it he looks up at her He
smiles She smiles back Thats all he heeds to move to
the bed and start kissing her Her mouth her neck

He lifts her shirt revealing her naked stomach which he
kisses sweetly Sydney’s head is back eyes closed
relaxing giving in Then his face against her stomach
Danny says

DANNY
It’s impossible isn’t it That one
day there’s gonna be a baby in
here

This triggers an uneasiness in Sydney She looks down at
him closer than ever to telling him the truth

DANNY (CONT‘D)
My patients wouldn’t like that
Knowing their doctor still can’t
believe that women can actually get
pregnant

He continues kissing her Finally quietly

SYDNEY
We need to talk about something
(beat he looks at her)
I don’t uh I don’t know if I can

have kids
Danny stops -- looks up at her Concerned confused
DANNY
what

She looks at him so on the verge of telling him

DANNY (CONT’D)
You love kids you said you wanted

five
SYDNEY
No I said “in theory Id love five”
DANNY -
(beat confused but sweet)
What uh Is this is this a

medical thing or

(she shakes her head looks

away a beat)

then Syd what are you talking
about

She looks at him for a long beat then makes a decision
She TURNS UP THE MUSIC on her stereo then extends her
hand He takes her hand and she leads him to 4

INT SYDNEYS APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

She turns on the LOUD SHOWER begins undressing He
smiles

DANNY
You do want kids or don’t want kids

SYDNEY
(simple earnest)
Get undressed

Intrigued Danny does And Beth Orton continues to SING as
they step inside the shower Sydney puts her arms around
his neck He kisses her but she stops him He’s
confused And the MUSIC BUILDS making this a purely
emotional not sexual moment

DANNY
Whats going on

A long beat then she finally says the words

SYDNEY
Im a spy

A moment as Danny takes this in The MUSIC continues as he
smiles -- then he laughs But he looks into her eyes
her face remains firm and constant and he’s never seen
this expression before

d his smi vanj as he j she isn’ idding

And we CUT TO a WIDE SHOT from outside the shower looking
at them through the shower door We can’t hear what she’s
saying but she’s talking to him Trying to explain and
he’s stunned Shes desperate Hes horrified And
though we can’t hear dialogue we can see in this
moment shes losing him

Finally reeling he turns and leaves the shower -- she
just stands there heartsick -- and as the steamed-shower
DOOR CLOSES hiding her face we SMASHCUT TO

INT JANITORIAL ROOM - NIGHT

The DOOR OPENS - our signature rhythmic SYNTH MUSIC
RETURNS -- Sydney’s hair -- again RED HAIR -- is wet

She’s handcuffed to the chair - a Taiwanese MAN in a DARK
SUIT and GLASSES enters with a horrific-looking SYRINGE --
Sydney’s eyes WIDEN IN HORROR -- the man preps the needle --
a stream of medication SQUIRTS into the air and the MUSIC

CRESCENDOS and Sydney’s about to SCREAM as a Guard SLAMS
THE DOOR SHUT ON US and we--

CUT TO BLACK

ENDACT ONE

ee

ACT Two
FADE IN
INT JANITORIAL ROOM - NIGHT

The two Guards hold down a tense resisting red-haired
Sydney as the eerie dark-suited glasses-wearing Man
injects quite a bit of medication into her arm She’s
terrified as the PLUNGER forces the liquid from the barrel
into her veins --

- -- and the Man pulls out the syringe The Guards let her
go She sits in the chair slumped from exhaustion but
looking up at the Man with the syringe Hers is a fierce
glare A devastating stare atypical of an underdog It
says in a silent universally understood instant it might
not look like it at the moment but I swear to God Im
gonna kick your ass

The Man slowly smiles as Sydney’s eyes flutter the
medication taking effect Her head drops out of a sudden
exhaustion The Man and the-Guards leave the room

Now she’s alone and were TIGHT on her eyes as she
looks off in a daze trying to keep it together and
as her eyes CLOSE we CUT TO

EXT SYDNEY’S APARTMENT - DAY

Danny leaves Sydneys apartment in a world of confusion
having just received the shock of a lifetime Sydney
(longer dark hair) follows him troubled

SYDNEY
Danny would you wait please

He gets into his fifteen year-old Land Cruiser and starts
the engine she opens the passenger door and gets in

INT DANNYS LAND CRUISER - DAY

She looks at him for a desperate beat He can’t meet her
gaze She tells this story heavy-hearted As if
describing why and how she made her pact with the Devil

SYDNEY
It was during the fall of my freshman
year

Danny looks up at her And as she continues we SEE THE
FOLLOWING IMAGERY CAMERA always floating MOVING through
the scenes

“i

EXT ACKERMAN UNION - DAY

Sydney’s a freshman here Dark even longer hair Shes
younger more insecure A loner She sits at a table by
herself highlighting a textbook

SYDNEY (V0)
-A man approached me

A 40-ish MAN in a dark suit sits across from Sydney
Introduces himself Extends a business card Sydney is
tentative

SYDNEY (V0) (CONTD)
He knew my name He told me that the
US government might be interested in
talking to me About a job

INT CLASSROOM - DAY
We FLOAT DOWN an aisle of Students taking a test

SYDNEY (V0)
When I asked “Why me” all he said
is that I fit a profile

And we find Sydney holding the business card Looking
at it Almost hungrily we MOVE IN on her’

SYDNEY (VO) (CONTD)
I could start training right away
Stay at UCLA Theyd pay my
tuition send me through graduate
school

INT UCLA CAMPUS - DAY

We MOVE AROUND Sydney at a pay phone surrounded by the’
university universe She’s dialing the number on the
business card

SYDNEY (VO)
Iwas lonely Francie was away I

INT DANNY’S LAND CRUISER - DAY

She’s looking off trying to make sense of it herself
tears welling in her éyes

SYDNEY

Six I-always imagined there was
something else That there had to be
Something I could belong to To make

The way she looks at him he somehow gets it she’s in too
deep Knows too much Owes them too much

DANNY
When you say “dangerous” what what

intensity that we can feel the threat of not following this
advice

SYDNEY

SYDNEY (CONTD)

(he nods)

beat he subtly pulls back This makes her want to cry

DANNY (CONTD)

He looks at her for a solid beat -- knowing now that the

story is a cover This is what their lives will be
DANNY

She just looks at him confirming his suspicions He nods
SYDNEY
(quietly)

stares off out the window at the darkness Hirsch looks
at her Smiles Then quietly

HIRSCH
You know Sloane doesn’t like it
(beat off her look)
That you’re still in school

SYDNEY
Yeah I know

Hed rather I not have any interest
outside SD-6

About what we are

His eyes meet hers It’s not even within the realm of
possibility

HIRSCH

loves being a banker

SYDNEY
How do you do it
(beat)
When she looks into your eyes how
do you shut that door To the person

How can that be okay

Hirsch starts to realize Sydney might actually be

considering telling the man in her life he’s talking to
her in a different tone now Warning her
HIRSCH
Because it’s not an option
(beat)

Because Syd if there’s one rule you
don‘t break that’s the rule you don’t
break You know how strict they are

Sydney senses Hirsch’s suspicion She nods forces a
smile -
“SYDNEY

It must just get easier After time

HIRSCH

We MOVE THROUGH the crowd past polite conversation --
hearing bits here and there in various languages and
accents Business talk investments mergers
acquisitions

And there near the grand red-draped windows is Sydney
And the transformation is extraordinary the girl we have
previously known as a graduate school sweetheart and dark-
suited agent now wears a devastating Michael Kors dress
She‘s stumning Far and away the most glanced-at woman at
this gathering she’s in conversation with a tuxedoed
Taiwanese BUSINESSMAN Both speaking Taiwanese

And during the conversation Sydney glimpses across the
room at Hirsch He too is talking with some Partygoers

Hirsch gives her a look the time is now

Sydney swallows the last of her champagne and excuses
herself from ‘the Businessman who quickly pulls out a
business card She takes it bows graciously and excuses
herself 7
As she heads across the party she passes a suit- and
glasses-wearing SECURITY OFFICER He stoically stands
guard earwire visible i

gripped by what appears to be a HEART ATTACK -- the people
he’s talking to react shocked as Hirsch drops his wine
glass which SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION -

People turn to look as Hirsch falls to the floor in

wincing pain The STRING QUARTET stutters to a stop --

INT TAIPEI CULTURAL AFFAIRS BUILDING - EAST WING - NIGHT

Sydney grid-measures another dark office Then she heads
down the hall again when she HEARS approaching VOICES

She retreats -- taking cover in the office she just gauged
She peeks through the ajar door watching a MAN and WOMAN
pass by in conversation Theyre wearing lab coats Once
they’re gone Sydney heads out continues

listens to the door Hears nothing Tries the handle No

She hikes up her dress lifts her right foot and pulls from
the heel of her shoe an ultra-thin LOCK PICK and an equally
miniature TENSION WRENCH She goes to work on the lock
Were TIGHT ON Sydney as she plies her trade -- she glances
up for a flash then back at the lock --

satisfying CLACK and the door opens --

INT TAIPEI CULTURAL AFFAIRS BUILDING - LAB - NIGHT

A darkened research laboratory Sydney enters aims her
lipstick and takes a GRID snapshot Then she notices
something across the room Hidden behind other pieces of
lab equipment something is glowing

She moves toward the bluish light something drawing her
to it and as she approaches we see it with her

sealed in a LOCKED GLASS CASE remember the plan for that

odd machine designed by Oskar Kunther

- They’ve built one

—
And whatever it is it’s a miraculous construction -- far
smaller than you would have imagined on an 8x6-inch wooden
board it’s an amalgam of old technology and new
Resistors and tubes soldered wires and computer chips
Its attached to a simple 9-volt battery but here’s what’ s
amazing at the center of the board are two copper
connections -- little cones pointing at each other a
three-inch span between them Floating between the two
copper points is an UNDULATING BALL OF BLUE LIGHT
Whipping around the ball are LIGHT RINGS alternating their
rotation

It’s like a miniature spinning holographic representation
of Saturn

And whatever this machine is Sydney is compelled to look
closer closer what the hell is this

As Sydney heads back to the party SUIT AND GLASSES rounds

hand on his shoulder as he assists her back to her feet
She kindly subtly touches his face Says quietly

porcelain Maneki-Neko LUCKY CAT

‘She moves through the apartment heads for the bathroom

SYDNEY (cont’d)
Remember that lucky cat That Kevin
had I think you’re gonna love this

And she pushes the door open -- and what she sees horrifies
her -- she DROPS the cat which BREAKS into pieces --

Were looking past the bathtub -- but there’s enough of a
glimpse of the FOREGROUND to see the BLOOD splattered on
the white tile

Sydney unable to breathe moves to her fiancé’s dead
body she looks at the horrible sight for a long moment
before finally breaking down sobbing She reaches for
him Cradles him

And we CUT BACK to a WIDE SHOT of Sydney on her knees at
the bathtub her cries reverberating on the bathroom walls

EXT DANNY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

desk And the MUSIC STOPS -- it’s all quiet now He looks

up at her Her eyes like a demon’s -- she’s quaking with
emotion We know she can kill with her hands in this
Moment we wonder if she’s about to
SYDNEY
What did you do

A beat Sloane just looks at her Doesnt give He hits
a button on his desk remote The door closes behind her
Locks

SLOANE
I might ask you the same question

-Of course she knew But this is confirmation She works
to maintain her composure A losing battle

SLOANE (CONTD)
Security Section became aware of the
breach And they performed their
function

Sydney covers her mouth numb shaking

SLOANE (cont‘d)
Youre familiar with the codes of
conduct Agent Bristow And you knew
those codes applied to you Even as
you put this entire Agency at risk

Sydney drops to her knees now crying Sloane watches her
for a beat -- stern but with a trace of sympathy He moves
to her Holds out his handkerchief But she’s too gone to
even notice

SYDNEY
- Danny wasn’t he wasn’t a
risk he was just a man a doctor

he

But her cries overtake her words Sloane drops the
handkerchief beside her

SLOANE
Information about the Agency must be
treated like a virus There is only
one response and that is containment
(MORE)

SLOANE (CONTD)
You put us in a compromised situation

and while I despise the
countermeasure we had no-

LIGHTNING FAST she’s up -- grabs Sloane by the collar and
shoves him against the desk- fast as a cougar-strike

- SYDNEY
(sinister but hushed)
Stop saving “we” Stop talking about
Machine You killed the man I love
Forced back Sloane remains calm
SLOANE
No Agent Bristow
(beat)
You did

Sydney looks at him for a long moment She then lets go ofw
himand moves to the door -- tries the handle It’s
locked She turns to him eyes ferocious

SYDNEY
Let me out

SLOANE
I can’t imagine how difficult this is
for you

SYDNEY
Let me out

SLOANE
However before you can go anywhere
McColloch needs to see you
(off her dismay and fear)
You’re a risk now too

Sydney realizing what she’s up against just stands there
stunned Disgusted On the verge of sobbing again

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

HAUNTING MUSIC is the only sound as we PAN OUT OF DARKNESS
to reveal Sydney sitting in a darkened acoustic foam-
tiled room She’s got a dozen SENSORS attached to her skin
-- her forehead her chest her hands all running into a
next-gen LIE DETECTOR

She sits there staring off numb from the horror of the

night as AGENT MCCOLLOCH a 63 year-old agent intensely
questions her

She responds to all the questions without looking up
Staring at nothing Most answers mono-syllabic She
doesn’t even realize the tear that runs down her cheek

As McColloch questions her he scribbles notes on the
detector printout

We DISSOLVE from image to image question to question
Sydney is being subjected to hours of this As if they
keep drawing blood and bravely unmovingly Sydney keeps
giving

Finally McColloch stands ‘Taking some paperwork with him
he leaves the room The SOUND of DOORLOCKS

We HOLD on Sydney for a moment Her expression lost and
constant she simply reaches for the snake of cables
connected to all the wires attached to her and she
absentmindedly pulls

POP POP POPOPOP the sensors pull from her face her
chest her hands She looks over at the small-window in
the door

Sydney moves to the door and peers out
SYDNEY’S POV

Framed by the door window we see into the Agency corridor
where McColloch is talking to Sloane

McColloch’s expression is dispassionate impossible to
read as he reviews the printout results of Sydney’s
evaluation with Sloane Sloane nods taking it all in

Were on Sydney watching carefully Somewhere in her
expression of heartwrenching sorrow is a glimmer of hope
A CLOSE-UP of McColloch’s MOUTH as he speaks Then
Sydneys EYES She’s reading his lips Her eyes are’
welling with tears as Sloane nods again’ He understands
Thanks McColloch

McColloch walks off as Sloane alone looks over the file
Then he looks up His eyes meet Sydneys

There’s a moment where we can’t tell what the outcome is --
life or death

He seems to place a crumpled paper napkin into his right
hand which is now a fist

CLAY

blow Right here

(Joe blows on Clay’s right

fist)
Okay are you watching Check this

sweet that Sydney touches Clay’s shoulder in thanks ‘Then

EXT WESTWOOD - NIGHT

Were outside looking into a restaurant where Sydney sits
alone at a table She’s at the end of a solitary meal

She sips her coffee glances at a Couple at a nearby table
Obviously on a fun date She smiles watching them

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Sydney walks across the dark UCLA garage Not a person

in sight She arrives at her car -- a full-size Ford pick-
up -- and pulls out her keys She unlocks the door and
gets in

INT FORD PICK-UP - NIGHT

It’s so quiet in here there’s so little happening that

you can sense an approaching storm

Sydney too She goes still then glances to her left --
RACK FOCUS inside the car parked beside her a MAN -- FACE
OBSCURED BY A DARK FACEMASK - SITS UP AND AIMS AN AKMPS-SD

SILENCED SUBMACHINE GUN AT SYDNEY --

SHE HITS THE PASSENGER SEAT AS THE MAN EIRES -- HER WINDOW
SHATTERS -- Sydney scampers for the passenger door --

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Sydney rolls out of her car -- reaches in grabs her PURSE
as the SHOOTER’S CAR a SILVER SEDAN SCREECHES out of its
parking space Sydney RUNS FULL-BORE down the aisle of
cars she SPRINTS CUTTING ACROSS THE LOT as the silver
SEDAN SCREAMS AFTER HER -- the Shooter FIRES BULLETS POCK-
MARKING CONCRETE

She bolts into the stairwell -- the Shooter JUMPS out of
the sedan and follows on foot -- the sedan SCREECHES away -

Sydney RACES down the stairs the Shooter in hot pursuit --
KLAKLAKLAK

and she’s shot at again and again -- RICOCHET SPARKS and
CONCRETE SPRAY -- and she runs out to the next level --
RUNNING AS HARD AS SHE CAN turning into a row of cars
disappearing from sight

The Shooter moves through the aisles searching hard

We find Sydney hiding behind an SUV breathing heavily but
silently She pulls out a compact from her purse opens it
and slowly lifts it uses the mirror as a makeshift
PERISCOPE Sees the Shooter approaching in the reflection
combing the area

Sydney looks for a way out Nothing Her mind races She
pulls out her cell phone She uses the compact to check
again -- there he is and at a moment when the Shooter is
looking away she THROWS HER CELL PHONE across the lot to
another aisle of cars and takes cover again

The CRASHING SOUND makes the Shooter turn He runs in that
direction --
-
The Shooter arrives at another aisle of cars He searches
for Sydney gun at the ready it’s a tense moment when
suddenly Sydney‘s behind him -- in a wicked display of KRAV
MAGA Sydney DISARMS the guy BREAKS his nose WHIP-KICKS
him in the head SLAMS him into one parked car then back
into another -- he fights back but she’s too damn good and
after her third KNEE to his FACE he crumples onto the
pavement a bloody mess and she grabs the weapon aiming
it at him out of breath but tougher than ever --

Thats when a DARK SEDAN SCREECHES TO A STOP BEHIND HER --
Sydney whips around aims the gun and is shocked to see --”

Jack Bristow driving No man has ever seemed more urgent ”

JACK
GET IN
And suddenly nothing makes sense to her

TEARS AWAY pursued by the silver sedan --

INT SEDAN - NIGHT

Sydney looks at her father eyes wide her face wracked in
confusion -- confusion that only deepens as Jack pulls a
GUN from a hidden shoulder holster -- he checks the clip --

terrifying

Jack YANKS the steering wheel JAMS the brakes --
INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Jacks car pulls a sudden 180 -- he’s now FACING THE
ONCOMING SILVER CAR -- out his window Jack FIRES AGAIN AND
AGAIN -- SHATTERING THE SILVER CAR’S WINDSHIELD --

The MASKED DRIVER IS HIT -- HE SLUMPS AGAINST THE STEERING
WHEEL its HORN now BLARING --

Jack wrenches his car into REVERSE -- PUNCHES the
accelerator and DRIVES BACKWARDS as the silver kamikaze car
speeds toward them -- another well-trained maneuver and
Jack quickly turns the car at an intersection -- the silver
car continues straight and SLAMS into a concrete wall --
CHASE OVER

EXT CHIANG KAI-SHEK AIRPORT - NIGHT

Sydney walks speedily through the airport parking
structure dressed now ENTIRELY IN BLACK (the outfit shes
been wearing throughout the Suit and Glasses scenes) Her
eyes scan every vehicle here -- then she spots a parked
2000 Aprilia FalcoSL1000V motorcycle --

She makes sure she’s alone here as she approaches the bike

throbbing and intoxicating as Sydney crouching behind a
parked car pulls the rope from her backpack She quickly
ties a BOWLINE KNOT pulls the rest of the rope through the
loop She pulls out the two smallest screwdrivers then
ZIPS the backpack throws it into a nearby GARBAGE CAN and
heads across the street

wall which surrounds the building She heaves the rope
secures it She climbs

Sydney lands within the lawn-and-tree perimeter of the

she remains in the shadows She spots two Guards at a
distant corner of the building talking smoking SECURITY
CAMERAS dot the property

She scrutinizes the building weighs her options Giant
windows on the ground floor all closed ‘Then she sees on
the second floor beyond a balcony is adarkened room
window that is ajar She looks back at the Guards -- the
building -- the tree

And in a flash Sydney crosses the grounds low and swift
More feline than human she scales the tree with mind-
splitting confidence and speed -- higher than you’d think
necessary --

And then grabbing tight hold of a branch she jumps -- AND
THE BRANCH BENDS WITH HER -- PLACING HER WITHIN REACH OF
THE BALCONY She grabs the balcony railing -lets go of the
branch which WHIPS BACK --

The Guards turn toward the RUSTLE of leaves --

Sydney silently enters the building through the window
Looks around An executive office Three doors She

Sydney cuffed to the chair slowly awakens Her head is
back and she’s squinting at the hanging light Her face
is smudged with dirt and some dried blood As she lets her
head fall forward she groggily feels the agony of her
mouth With her tongue she feels the place a tooth used
to be

She looks around the room A small pointless window
Mops Spray bottles of-cleaning liquid Then the door
opens -- a Guard has unlocked the door Suit and Glasses
enters again Door closes He looks at her Smiles

KLAKS the pliers

She looks up at him sad empty out of gas She starts to
quietly cry His face barely changes but we can tell Suit

Then she speaks - her voice is so raw so thrashed from
screaming she can barely speak

Sydney stands at Danny’s grave Her hair is dark again
She looks pretty She sets a bouquet of flowers down upon
the now-grass-covered grave She looks at the tombstone
and while she isnt crying she is clearly overwhelmed by
this loss and the guilt

And after a long moment Sydney senses something She
turns around Standing six yards away is Jack Her look
says it all what the hell are you doing here

JACK
I wanted to say I was sorry
SYDNEY
You don’t have to
(beat)
I’m back at work again I guess you
know that
JACK

I meant sorry about Danny

She looks at her father hating him now more than
ever but revealing the depths of her repulsion might

give her away

SYDNEY
Thanks But I‘d really like to be
alone If you don’t mind

JACK
(trying it isn’t easy)
I know what it’s like
(beat)
To lose someone that you uh--

herself)
Listen I don’t know what you expect
Just because we’re working for the
same people just because I know the
truth about you How That doesn’t
change a thing between us

(beat)
I accept what I’m doing now because I
have to That doesn’t mean I have to
accept you

A beat Then Jack walks toward her -- she tenses -- he
reaches into his coat -- she takes a step back -- and he
pulls out a small SILVER CELL PHONE He offers it to her
Unsure she looks up at him He speaks quietly

JACK
I asked the Chief Director if I could
come tell you myself Chief Director
of the CIA
(beat)
You‘re in

She looks at him bewildered Finally at a whisper

SYDNEY -
» youre CIA

JACK
I appreciate you not naming me In

She averts his look -- at this small sign that somewhere
deep down she cares about him too

JACK (CONT’D)
You don’t know how dangerous it is
Sydney Doing what I do
(beat)
I wish youd taken me up on
Switzerland

She’s still reeling realizing that she and her father are
doing the same thing Then a flash of doubt

SYDNEY
How do you I know what youre telling
me is the truth

He just looks at his daughter regretful that after
twenty-six years this is the condition of their
relationship

JACW
I guess we’ll just have to learn to
trust each other

Jack holds out the phone After a beat she takes it He
tries to smile but it’s a failure He just turns and
walks off She watches him go overwhelmed
