stuffed-
nose voice

WALTER
When I was seven my mother and
grandmother took me to Vancouver We
were walking along the street one day
when these two men ran past and snatched
my grandmothers purse right from under
her arm Right from under her arm That
night a police officer came to our hotel
room to ask us questions Stood the
whole time

The ferry pitches again Will grabs on to the railing
Looking down at this little man Hate in his eyes

WALTER (contd)
His uniform looked brand new His shoes
and badge were polished his billy club
his belt buckle All perfect He was
like a soldier but better

Walter reaches up to blow his nose Wills eyes look on
in

disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen From

beating Kay Connell to death

WALTER (contd)
Made a huge impression on me His
goodness Gave me an instant respect for
the police I tried to become a cop when
I left high school but

He points to his hearing-aid

A COUPLE KIDS Further down the glacier Having a
fight
Will looks back at Walter Has to take it easy Shoves
away in disgust Walter falls down onto the snow

Watches Will pace Head throbbing Ribs screaming in
WALTER
Then why lie about it
Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid
it back around his ear
WALTER (contd)
I mean Im all for bending the truth

trade you might say But why cover it
up
Gets up Brushes the snow from his butt Checks

and watch an eight year-old boy get
picked up by his carpool across the

the boy get dropped off again He did
this for about six months Until one day
he got up the nerve to cross the street
and grab the boy before his carpool came
