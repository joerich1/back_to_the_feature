EXT SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Woodlands Beautiful Untamed Soaring old-growth elms
arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently
curving deep-water Santee River

SUPERIMPOSITION

SOUTH CAROLINA
April 1776
Upstream the swamps Beautiful Hundreds of BIRDS SING
Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy cutting through the
hanging moss and kudzu falling onto soft swaying ferns
covering the high ground

The water is clear with fields of floating lily pads
each with a stark white flower rising from it

SUPERIMPOSITION

THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A
TRUE STORY

EXT POND BLUFF - DAY

A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep
green of the swamps Good fertile land hacked out of
the wilderness

The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley hops
alfalfa and tobacco Two sturdy brothers NATHAN 13 and
SAMUEL 12 work one of the fields rhythmically swinging
scythes through the barley

The house built of native brick is well-constructed and
well-maintained Theres a barn a workshop and a forge
It is a home of substance rather than wealth On the
front porch MARGARET 11 pumps a butter churn while her
brother WILLIAM 6 watches

GABRIEL 18 strong and handsome walks out of the woods
with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his
shoulder At his side walks THOMAS 14 also carrying a
musket

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

A perfect colonial workshop fastidiously arranged with
every conceivable tool of the period A foot-powered
lathe A drop-forge A lifting saw Racks of tools
planes hammers augers drills blocks all hanging in
their places All very well-worn

FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe turning a
piece of hardwood shaving off tiny curls of wood with a
razor-sharp chisel Hes in his late-forties strong and
weathered His hands though big and callused handle the
chisel with a surgeons precision Self-educated and
self-sufficient he has built himself as he built his
farm brick by brick from the coarse clay of the earth

A finely-made rocking chair missing only the dowel on
which Marion is working sits on the work table The

chair is a work of art thin and light a spider-web of
perfectly turned wood no nails no glue

Sitting on the woodpile SUSAN 4 a silent stone-face
wisp of a child watches her father

Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe carefully
fits it into the chair inserts a peg and taps it into
place Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork

He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale
countering with a three-pound weight The chair floats

Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks Susan
nods so far so good Marion puts the chair on the floor
and walks slowly around it checking every angle

Then the acid test He takes a deep breath and lowers
himself onto the seat gingerly adding an ounce at a time
Not a creak He smiles and sits back with a sigh

CRACK THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marions weight DUMPING
HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood

MARION
Damnation

He picks up some of the wood about to fling it across the
room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look
He calms himself

MARION
Sorry

Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of
the chair in the fireplace As she climbs back up to her
perch Marion steps over to his wood rack extracts a
fresh dowel fits it into the lathe and starts all over
again

END CREDITS

Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side Nathan

and Samuel walk past exhausted from their day in the

Father I saw a post rider at the
house

MARION
Thank you Did you finish the upper
field

SAMUEL
We got it all cut and we bundled

Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his
contrite sons who jostle one another trying to pass off
the blame Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn

GABRIEL

Charleston You have a letter

inside

Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and
Thomas to the house She does so and Marion walks on
alone toward

EXT HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSET

The loveliest spot on the farm A beautiful view of the
house barns river fields and hills beyond A
gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree It
reads

ELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION 1738-1773

Above her name is a carving of the night sky at the
center of which is the NORTH STAR steady and guiding

Marion approaches He gives himself a moment to look at
the grave then he starts picking apples speaking to the
gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact
than sorrowful

MARION
» and they bundled half almost
no trace of the boys you knew

A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground
Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply

MARION
» no she still hasnt spoken
Margaret was her age when you I
remember the time at the river when
we couldnt find Catherine you
couldnt stop crying and she was
asleep in the wagon the entire
time

Marion pauses remembering The CRASH OF A PLATE

exasperated sigh

the lights of candles and oil lamps

the children

and shoos the children inside Gabriel steps out and
joins them

MARION
What news

GABRIEL
The British army is barricaded in
Boston Harry Lee is here from
Virginia recruiting for a
Continental Army

MARION
Is that why the Assembly was
convened

GABRIEL
Yes He seeks a levy of troops and
money

MARION
And the Governor

GABRIEL
He vowed that if the Assembly votes
a single shilling to Lee hell
dissolve the body

MARION
Which would force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for
independence

CHARLOTTE
And send us to war alongside
Massachusetts

MARION
Our governor is a bigger fool than I
thought

GABRIEL
Lee is counting on your vote and
expects you to be the first to
enlist

Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks
of Lees expectations Marion turns back to watch the
mob

EXT ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY

The capital building of South Carolina A large crowd of
lower-class men and women is massed in front of the

INT ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

Two dozen ANGRY YELLING MEN OF PROPERTY Among them are
ROBINSON HAMILL and JOHNSON who are Patriots Opposed
to them are SIMMS WITHINGTON and BALDRIDGE who are
Loyalists (loyal the the King) As Marion makes his way
to his seat the SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY POUNDS HIS GAVEL

SPEAKER
ORDER ORDER

Slowly the room quiets down

SPEAKER
Our first order of business

SIMMS
And out last if we vote a levy

The ROOM ERUPTS

SPEAKER
ORDER ORDER Mr Simms you do
not have the floor

The ROOM SETTLES DOWN

SPEAKER
Our first order of business is an
address by Colonel Harry Lee of the
Continental Army

An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of
the assembly Hes COLONEL HARRY LEE about Marions age
and cut from the same cloth -- strong weathered with a
powerful bearing The room quiets down

Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod which Marion
returns stone-faced Then Lee speaks simply and
clearly

LEE
You all know why I am here I am
not an orator and I will not try to
convince you of the worthiness of
our cause I am a soldier and we
are at war and with the declaration
of independence we all expect from
Philadelphia it will soon be a
formal state of war In preparation
for that eight of the thirteen
colonies have levied money in
support of a Continental Army I
ask South Carolina to be the ninth
SIMMS
Colonel Lee Massachusetts may be at
war along with New Hampshire and
Rhode Island and Virginia but South
Carolina is not at war

LEE
Massachusetts and New Hampshire are
not as far from South Carolina as
you might think and the war theyre
fighting is not for independence of
one or two colonies Its for the
independence of a nation

WITHINGTON
And what nation is that

Robinson one of the Patriots stands up

ROBINSON
An American nation Colonel Lee
with your permission

LEE
Please

ROBINSON
Those of us who call ourselves
Patriots are not seeking to give
birth to an American nation but to
protect one that already exists It
was born a hundred-and-seventy years
ago at Jamestown Virginia and has
grown stronger and more mature with
every generation reared and with
every crop sown and harvested We
are a nation and our rights as
citizens of that nation are
threatened by a tyrant three
thousand miles away

LEE
Thank you Were I an orator those
are the exact words I would have
spoken

Laughter Marion rises

MARION
Mister Robinson tell me why should
I trade one tyrant three thousand
miles away for three thousand
tyrants one mile away

Laughter from the Loyalists Surprise from Lee and the
Patriots In the gallery Gabriel winces
More laughter

Laughter

ROBINSON
Sir

MARION
An elected legislature can trample a
mans rights just as easily as a
King can

LEE
Captain Marion I understood you to
be a Patriot

MARION
Its Mister Marion

LEE
I understood him to be a Patriot as
well

MARION
If you mean by a Patriot am I angry
at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp
Act Then Im a Patriot And what
of the Navigation Act Should I be
permitted to sell my tobacco to the
French traders on Martinique Yes
and its an intrusion into my
affairs that I cant legally

MARION

And what of the greedy self-serving
bastards who sit as Magistrates on
the Admiralty Court and have fined
nearly every man in this room
Should they be boxed about the ears
and thrown onto the first ship back
to England Ill do it myself

(beat)
And do I believe that the American
colonies should stand as a separate
independent nation free from the
reins of King and Parliament I do
and if that makes a Patriot then
Im a Patriot

Marion grows more serious

MARION
But if youre asking whether Im
willing to go to war with England
the answer is no Ive been to war
and I have no desire to do so again
The room is quiet the Assemblymen having been thrown off-
balance Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his
fathers speech

ROBINSON
This from the same Captain Francis
Marion whose anger was so famous
during the Wilderness Campaign

Marion glares at Robinson then smiles

MARION
I was intemperate in my youth My
departed wife God bless her soul
dampened that intemperance with the
mantle of responsibility

Robinson looks derisively at Marion

ROBINSON
Temperance can be a convenient
disguise for fear

Marion bristles but before he can answer Lee steps in

LEE
Mister Robinson I fought with
Captain Marion in the French and
Indian War including the Wilderness
Campaign We served as scouts under
Washington and I have no doubts
about Captain Marions courage or
competence on a battlefield
Theres not a man in this room or
anywhere for that matter to whom I
would more willingly trust my life

ROBINSON
I stand corrected

LEE
Nonetheless I would like to know
Mister Marion how how how

Lees oratorical skills peter out

LEE
Damn it Francis How in Gods name
do you expect to gain independence
without going to war

MARION
Harry Harry Harry

Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more
than two old friends pissed off
LEE
My hairy arse You live in a cave
if you think well get independence
without war

The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL

SPEAKER
Gentlemen Please This is not a
tavern

MARION
Wasnt it a Union Jack we fought
under

LEE

A long time ago

MARION
Thirteen years

LEE
Thats a damn long time

The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again

SPEAKER
Gentlemen Please

Marion and Lee ignore the speaker

MARION
You were an Englishman then

LEE
I was an American I just didnt
know it yet

The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch
the argument avidly turning their heads in simultaneous
anticipation of each rejoinder

MARION
We dont have to go to war to gain
independence

LEE
Balderdash

MARION

There are a thousand avenues other
than war at our disposal

LEE
Name five hundred

MARION
Royal petition delegates to court
judicial redress economic boycott
bribery

LEE
Thats five keep going

MARION
time royal succession
regicide bribery

LEE
You said bribery twice

Marion speaks slowly and firmly

MARION
We do not have to go to war to gain
independence

Lee says nothing for a moment then he speaks more
seriously quietly grimly

LEE
Francis I was at Bunker Hill It
was as bad as anything you and I saw
on the frontier Worse than the
slaughter at the Ashuelot River
The British advanced three times and
we killed over seven hundred of them
at point blank range And still
they advanced and they took the
ground That is the measure of
their resolve If your principles
dictate independence then war is
the only way It has come to that

Marion is silent for a long moment He softens finds
himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever
wanted to

MARION
I have seven children My wife is
dead Whos to care for them if I
go to war

Lee is stunned by Marions honesty and his show of
weakness At first Lee has no answer then

LEE
Wars are not fought only by
childless men A man must weigh his
personal responsibilities against
his principles

MARION
Thats what Im doing I will not
fight and because I wont I will
not cast a vote that will send
others to fight in my stead

LEE
And your principles

MARION
Im a parent I dont have the
luxury of principles

The other Assemblymen both Patriots and Loyalists
at him appalled Marion feeling weak sits down
looks at his friend with more sympathy than

Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses

disappointment
the chair

ROBINSON
Mister Speaker I call for a vote on
a levy to the Continental Army

The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron
They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air
Other soldiers STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND
DRUMS Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table
YELLING and jostling for position

The delegates walk out Both Patriots and Loyalists give
Marion a wide berth

Marion sees Gabriel standing near the crowd at the
recruiting table Marion walks up to him

GABRIEL
Father Ive lost respect for you
I thought you were a man of
principle

MARION
When you have children I hope
youll understand

GABRIEL
When I have children I hope I dont
hide behind them

Marion looks closely at Gabriel

MARION
Do you intend to enlist without my
permission

GABRIEL
Yes

They lock eyes for a moment then Gabriel turns from his
father and walks away joining the crush around the
recruiting table

Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos The FIFES
AND DRUMS continue to play Marion doesnt hear them

Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant
group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly

Lee excuses himself and steps over next to Marion Lee
sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment
table

LEE
One of yours

MARION
Gabriel

LEE
I recognize him now Is he as
imprudent as his father was at his
age

MARION

No thank the Lord Hes more like
his mother

LEE
Ill see to it that he serves under
me

MARION
Thank you

They shake hands Then Lee walks over to the soldiers
Marion takes a last look at Gabriel then heads off
through the crowded square moving against the tide of men
headed toward the recruiting table

He hears nothing He snaps the reins and continues
plowing
INT MARIONS ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON

Dark Thomas steps up into the attic He finds a trunk
and opens it Lifting out some blankets he uncovers a
trove of Marions old military gear -- a worn battle coat
a box of medals a military sword rusted into its
scabbard

Thomas puts on the coat which hangs off his narrow
shoulders He stands in front of a dusty mirror
appraising himself then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPS
coming up the stairs

Its Marion tired and dirty from his plowing Thomas
grimaces expecting him to be angry but sees him shake
his head gently

MARION
Not yet Thomas

THOMAS

Marion looks closely at his son giving him the courtesy
of really thinking about the answer

MARION

THOMAS
But its already been two years and

He doesnt respond Margaret trailed by William walks
down toward Samuel

MARGARET
Samuel get up to the house You

Then she sees it too The pale pink is turning redder
and redder And then the BODIES First one then more
many more Torn apart Missing limbs Those with wide-
open wounds are already drained of blood Others are
still seeping leaving trails of deep red in the paler red
of the surrounding water

Samuel Margaret and William stand frozen appalled and
fascinated

MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at
the river He cant see what theyre looking at
Irritated he walks toward them Then as he nears the
river he sees the color of the water and the bodies that
have hypnotized his children He quickens his stride
speaking calmly but firmly careful not to frighten them

MARION
Up to the house now All of you
come on Now

EXT MARIONS HOUSE - NIGHT

Quiet Dark Marion stands on the front porch looking
out into the night listening hearing nothing He
glances up at the star-filled sky tracking his eyes from

the Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR

BEHIND THE HOUSE A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS carrying a
musket moves from shadow to shadow

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Margaret and Samuel and William talk their voices low

SAMUEL
Theyre going to come

MARGARET

A SOUND They all stop Something moved behind the
kitchen Margaret silently eases the others out of the
room through the darkened hall toward their father

SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM A BLOODY FIGURE

Big Hulking In uniform Margaret SCREAMS William
and Samuel CRY OUT The figure moves toward them

Marion on the porch hears the scream races into the
house He sees the figure moves toward it

THE FIGURE MOVES INTO THE LIGHT Marion sees the
bloodied face

MARION
Gabriel

Gabriel is wounded battered and dirty He carries a
musket and a dispatch case He sways Marion catches him
and eases him to a seat

MARGARET
Youre hurt

THOMAS
The battle were you there

MARION
Margaret get bandages and water
Thomas the porch eyes open

Marion checks Gabriels wounds which are nasty but not
life-threatening

GABRIEL
Have you seen any Redcoats

MARION
Not yet What happened

Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly
cleans Gabriels wounds and applies field-dressings

GABRIEL
It wasnt like Saratoga There we
stayed in the trees but this time
Gates marched us straight at the
Redcoats They fired two volleys
into us and we broke like straw I
was given these dispatches I saw
Virginia Regulars surrender as
they laid down their weapons the
British Green Dragoons rode into
them and hacked them to bits
killed them all over two hundred
men

Marions appalled

MARION
They had surrendered

Gabriel nods Marions stunned Gabriel tries to rise

GABRIEL
I have to get these dispatches to
Hillsboro

MARION

Youre in no condition to ride

GABRIEL
I have no choice I

Gabriel passes out Marion catches him and carries him to
a day-bed in the parlor As Marion lays him down they
hear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE VERY CLOSE

Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night
the children cluster around him seeing a strange sight

A SKIRMISH IN THE FIELD BELOW THE HOUSE

Pitch black Then a MUSKET FIRES creating a FLASH OF
LIGHT that illuminates a tableau of soldiers about three
dozen Redcoats and as many Patriots

The strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an
ensuing VOLLEY OF SHOTS in every direction Then
darkness punctuated by SCREAMS OF PAIN CONFUSED
HOLLERING and the RUSTLING OF ARMED MEN IN MOVEMENT

Then the pattern repeats itself A MUSKET FIRES
illuminating a tableau of targets for another MURDEROUS
VOLLEY OF SHOTS

MARION
Margaret take William and Susan
down to the root cellar Thomas go
to the back porch Nathan and
Samuel the side windows Keep out
of sight

They hurry off Marion steps into the house and opens his
gun cabinet He extracts two pistols and a pair of
muskets Then he steps back to the front door He waits
and watches

EXT LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAWN

First light The morning mist lies low over the field
Marion warily approaches the scene of the battle He
carries a Pennsylvania rifle has another slung over his
shoulder and has a pair of pistols in his belt

As Marion nears the field he sees appearing out of the
low mist a nightmarish vision Young Redcoats and
Continentals are scattered on the ground dead and
wounded Many have been hideously torn apart by the
massive musket balls Blood is everywhere Marion
hurries back toward the house

EXT LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - MORNING

Marion loads the wounded men onto a wagon helped by
Thomas Nathan and Samuel

EXT MARIONS HOUSE - POND BLUFF - DAY

The porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital
There are about two dozen wounded a few more Patriots
than Redcoats Thomas Nathan Samuel and Margaret help
Marion tend the soldiers William and Susan watch from
inside

Marion treats an arm wound retying a tourniquet
stanching an ugly flow of blood

Marion moves to the next of the wounded Thomas starts to
help but Marion shakes his head

MARION
Hes dead

Marion moves on to another

MARION
Thomas help me turn him over

They turn over a young Continental and see a horrible
wound on his back Thomas swoons

MARION
Thomas

A hard glare from Marion strengthens his son Together
they bandage the wounded man

EXT MARIONS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Triage completed Margaret and Samuel give water and
food Marion kneels next to a CONTINENTAL SERGEANT and a
COUPLE OF PRIVATES who are less severely wounded than the
others

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT
Thank you

Marion nods uncomfortable with the thanks

MARION
Sergeant there are seventeen
wounded men here Seven Redcoats
and ten Patriots counting my son
inside That puts me in a difficult
position

The Continental Sergeant knows whats coming The
Privates and Marions children dont

MARION
You three are the least severely
wounded I have to ask you to leave
and find care elsewhere

The Privates are stunned at the request The Sergeant
looks at Marions children and nods

SERGEANT
I understand

He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two
Privates to do the same

SERGEANT
Come on boys

Nathan Samuel and Margaret are confused

THOMAS
Father

NATHAN
But theyre wounded

MARION
There are rules even in war

Marion motions to a large old scar on his arm

MARION

After the Battle of Ashuelot River
against the French I got this and
the one on my leg I couldnt walk
Washington had to march north He
left me with other wounded men and a
like number of French prisoners
Nine for nine When the French
found us their surgeon gave me the
best of care Well be safe this
way

Marions children are not convinced The Sergeant and the
two Privates gather themselves to leave

MARION
Your best chance is in Bennington
seven miles east along the river
road

The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road

MARION
Thank you

Marion and his children watch them go
EXT POND BLUFF ROAD - DAY

A dirt road runs along the edge of the Santee Swamps
stretching toward green rolling hills beyond Beautiful
country Peaceful Then the GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE A
THUNDEROUS SOUND rises louder and louder HORSES HOOVES
From around a bend a detachment of cavalry gallops

British GREEN DRAGOONS The finest light calvary in the
world Hard strong men Excellent horsemen Their
mounts are powerful muscled and perfectly cared for The
Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans marked with
the blood and dirt of a recent battle Tired and
vigorous

Theyre armed to the teeth Each carries a flintlock
carbine a brace of pistols and a sword Some carry
lances as well Regimental flags flutter They are forty
of the most imposing frightening horsemen imaginable

And at their head the most imposing man of all LT
COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON The Butcher Aristocratic
Strong Dark A powerful horseman on the best mount of
the entire troop Decorated Imperious No temper just
hard cold authority His men struggle to keep up with
him

Behind them two dozen LOYALIST MILITIA CALVARY (American
civilians loyal to the crown) Nasty local men
Civilian clothes Riding at their head is AMOS GASKINS
grizzled lower-class wearing ill-fitting patricians
clothing

AROUND A BEND

The three wounded Patriots who just left Marions farm
hear the horses coming stand on the side of the road
raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender
The Green Dragoons rein in Tarleton stops in front of
the three men He motions for one of his men to lower his
weapon Then he speaks calmly quietly to the wounded
men

TARLETON
Youre surrendering

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT
Yes sir

TARLETON
What unit

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT
First Virginia Regulars under
Colonel Hamilton

TARLETON
Who cared for your wounds

They hesitate

CONTINENTAL SERGEANT
We did

TARLETON
With a lace table cloth

Tarleton turns to his second-in-command MAJOR WILKINS

TARLETON
Kill them

Tarleton rides off Wilkins and several other Dragoons
calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS killing the three Patriots

The troops ride off thundering past the bodies of the

three men

EXT POND BLUFF - DAY

Marion and his children tend the wounded Gabriel weak
but walking helps REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of the
woods heading toward the house Three dozen men Scouts
and flank units covering the main body Marion gathers
his family around him stands and waits

The Redcoats get to the house warily eye the wounded and
Marions family A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions his
men to check out the house and barn then looks at the
wounded doing a silent count He turns to Marion

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
These men are of my regiment Thank
you

Marion nods ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house
carrying Gabriels dispatch case

REDCOAT
Rebel dispatches sir

Gabriel steps up

GABRIEL
I carried those I was wounded
these people gave me care they have
nothing to do with the dispatches

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
I understand

The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES All turn and see
TARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONS

Thundering down the road toward the house Its an
impressive frightening sight

They rein in their horses stopping in the yard enveloped
by their trailing cloud of dust

Tarleton surveys the scene then speaks to the young
Redcoat Lieutenant

TARLETON
Lieutenant have a detachment take
our wounded to our surgeons at
Camden crossing Use whatever
horses and wagons you can find here

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
Yes sir

He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
We found this sir

Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents

TARLETON
Who carried this

GABRIEL
I did

TARLETON
(to Lt re Gabriel)
Take this one to Camden hes a spy
He will be hung

Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel
MARION
Colonel hes a dispatch rider and
thats a marked dispatch case

Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the
Lieutenant

TARLETON
Fire the house and barns

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
Yes sir

MARION
Colonel

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
And the Rebel wounded

TARLETON
Kill them

The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked
by the order Marion is also but hes more concerned
with Gabriel He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at
Tarletons mount looking up

MARION
A dispatch rider with a marked case
cannot be held for spying

Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion He looks down
at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles

TARLETON
Were not going to hold him were
going to hang him

MARION
But

Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion
Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly
Redcoat Corporal

GABRIEL
Father

TARLETON
Oh hes your son You should have
taught him about loyalty

MARION
Colonel I beg you please
reconsider By the rules of war a
dispatch rider with a marked case
Tarleton controls his shifting mount keeping his pistol
trained on Marions face

TARLETON
Would you like a lesson in the rules
of war

Marion doesnt answer He looks up at Tarleton coldly
taking his measure waiting to see if hes going to pull
the trigger

Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his
aim pointing the pistol among Marions children

TARLETON
Perhaps your children would

The children are terrified Thomas is more angry than
frightened Marion quickly steps between the pistol and
his children and speaks quietly to Tarleton

MARION
No lesson is necessary

Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of
Marions children He smiles at the effect Then he
holsters his pistol

Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats ties
Gabriels hands Thomas is beside himself

THOMAS
Father do something

Thomas grows increasingly agitated He sees that his
father is going to do nothing He gauges the distance
between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods

Then suddenly Thomas SPRINGS He RUNS THROWING HIMSELF
into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel KNOCKING THEM DOWN

THOMAS
Gabriel Run

Gabriel is too shocked to take flight A few of the
Redcoats including one of the ones knocked down shake
their heads with sad laughter at Thomas ineffectual
gesture One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the
neck and yanks him to his feet

TARLETON sees the commotion Without pausing he DRAWS HIS
PISTOL AND FIRES HITTING THOMAS IN THE BACK

THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot Stunned
confused he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in
his chest
MARION horrified catches Thomas as he falls easing him
to the ground

MARGARET CRIES OUT THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned to
silence

The REDCOATS are frozen in place Tarletons GREEN
DRAGOONS are impassive having seen worse

MARION holds his son looking at the huge
incomprehensible wound He knows that Thomas is already
dead though his body still moves

MARIONS stunned agony turns to fury He rises his eyes
trained on Tarleton then stops as

TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREEN
DRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines aiming them at Marion
and his children

MARION FREEZES torn between his fury and fear for his
other children He locks his eyes on Tarleton

TARLETON calmly baths in Marions anger Then with a
hard yank of the reins he jerks his horses head around
and utters a sharp command to Wilkins

TARLETON
Major

Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking
back His GREEN DRAGOONS THUNDER after him

MARIONS CHILDREN begin to cry Margaret tries to revive
Thomas lifeless body gently caressing his cheek

MARGARET
Thomas please Thomas

The Redcoats watch in silence MARION LOOKS AT GABRIEL
and turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant

MARION
Lieutenant please

The Lieutenant wavers but he looks after the departing
Tarleton and his resolve stiffens He turns coldly to
Marion

REDCOAT LIEUTENANT
I have my orders Sergeant

The Redcoat infantrymen scatter some to get horses and
wagons from the barn others to torch the buildings

MARION stands among the children all of whom look to
Marion with pleading eyes waiting for him to do
something

MARGARET
Papa look what they did to
Thomas

NATHAN
Father theyre going to take
Gabriel

With stone-faced fury Marion watches the Redcoats do
their work

From the barns they hear the sounds of MUSKETS FIRING and
the SQUEALS OF THE LIVESTOCK being killed

Other REDCOATS TORCH THE HOUSE BARN AND OUTBUILDINGS
THE FLAMES RISE

The Redcoats bring out Marions wagons and carriages and
begin loading the Redcoat wounded

The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men walk among

the Patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet

begging for mercy The Redcoats quickly OPEN FIRE as if
to get it over with

The WOUNDED PATRIOTS CRY OUT More SHOTS Then SILENCE

GABRIEL his hands bound behind him looks to his father
with a combination of resoluteness and fear Marion locks
eyes with him

NATHAN
Father you cant let them take
him

MARION
Quiet

MARION AND THE CHILDREN

Watch as the Redcoats form up and move out leading
Gabriel on a tether Gabriel looks back helplessly but a
hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him
around They disappear around a bend in the road

THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT MARION speaks
firmly to his weeping children

MARION
Dont move

MARION STRIDES to his front door and ENTERS THE BURNING
HOUSE

INSIDE FIRE EVERYWHERE Picking a route between the
flames Marion walks to his gun cabinet He opens it and
pulls out weapons -- two Pennsylvania rifles two muskets
two pistols a long-bladed knife and a worn tomahawk He
carries them with powder horns and ammunition pouches
back toward the door

Marion walks OUT OF THE BURNING HOUSE

MARION
Nathan Samuel

Without breaking stride Marion throws muskets to Nathan
and Samuel who catch them

MARION
Margaret take William and Susan to
the river shed Hide there If
were not back by dawn go up the
river to the Richardsons house
Theyll take you to your Aunt
Charlottes farm Nathan Samuel
and I are going to get Gabriel

MARGARET
But what about Thomas

MARION
Leave him Take care of William and
Susan

Marion runs off toward the woods Nathan and Samuel
follow Margaret hesitates then herds William and Susan
toward the river The house is enveloped in flames

EXT WOODED PATH - AFTERNOON

Marion runs breathing hard keeping a punishing steady
pace Nathan and Samuel run behind less winded than
their father Marion makes up with cold fury what he
lacks in youth

EXT WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON

Marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill Slows
Crawls the last few feet Nathan and Samuel just behind
him Looks over the hillside

A path runs through a glen about fifty feet below
Marions eyes dart absorbing the terrain looking for

advantage He points

MARION
Nathan there Samuel there

The boys go where theyre told

MARION
Ill fire first Then Nathan kill
whoever is standing closest to
Gabriel Samuel kill the last man
in the line

They stagger under the weight of the orders Marion
notices but continues

MARION

After that Samuel load for Nathan
If something happens to me put down
your weapons and run as fast as you
can that way downhill Hide in
the brush by the river then make
your way home get the others and go
to Aunt Charlottes farm

The boys hesitate Marion looks at them firmly

MARION
Boys steady

NATHAN and SAMUEL
Yes father

Marion disappears into the underbrush

DOWN THE PATH

The dozen Redcoats approach Leading Gabriel on the rope
AHEAD OF THEM

Marion waits in the thick undergrowth

On the hillside Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and
exchange a frightened troubled look

The REDCOATS enter the glen

MARION waits then picks his moment and FIRES killing the
Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest

NATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE dropping the last
Redcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriels rope

THE REDCOATS STOP in confusion
GABRIEL kneels out of the line of fire
The REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command

REDCOAT SERGEANT
FORM BY TWOS BACK-TO-BACK LINES

MARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat
Samuel finishes reloading swaps muskets with Nathan who
FIRES DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT

REDCOAT CORPORAL
READY

Marion FIRES killing the Corporal the last man of
rank

Marion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET
FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marions rifle smoke

FROM THIS MOMENT ON MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING He
strides rather than runs staying just inside the brush
offering only glimpses of himself He changes his pace
and direction repeatedly ducking and weaving firing and
loading while moving He never gives the Redcoats a
stationary target especially one marked by billowing
smoke from his flintlock Its an Indian tactic and it
works

The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS about to
fire Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD REVERSES DIRECTION
several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS

Six Redcoats left Some primed some reloading A
REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and
FIRES killing him

Samuel WEEPING as he loads hands a primed musket to
Nathan who FIRES

The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY
NATHANS SMOKE

Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS He
instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN drawing the Redcoats
attention from his sons

Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS killing two Redcoats

One Redcoat finishes reloading Marion rushes him
shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with the
butt of the musket

This is a DIFFERENT MARION a vicious savage Marion
killing with stunning brutality

Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE
REDCOATS LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves
that musket into another Redcoats belly and FIRES

Two Redcoats left neither finished loading

MARION CHARGES drawing his TOMAHAWK ignores a GLANCING
BAYONET WOUND to the neck HACKS a Redcoat open
Splattering himself with BLOOD

The final Redcoat a cherubic-face young man ducks into

the woods Marion tears after him

A FOOTRACE the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE
BRUSH the older Marion panting losing ground

A CLEARING the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the

trees on the far side

MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air and
SINKS IN THE REDCOATS BACK

Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat grabs his hair yanks
back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT

Then without pausing Marion wrenches the tomahawk from
the Redcoats body and races back toward his sons

AT THE GLEN

Nathan and a weeping Samuel stunned at the carnage
stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel Marion runs up
and motions for them to stop

Marion checks the Redcoats making sure theyre all dead

MARION
Samuel reload Nathan untie
Gabriel

They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and
scans the road and the underbrush In a moment theyre
ready Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle then he
and his sons disappear into the underbrush

trying to bandage his wound

EXT HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER)

Marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave
Near tears and unsure of what to do next he turns to

in his own tears he gathers the children around him and
lets them cry

MARION

EXT CAMDEN ROAD - DAY

Marion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small
skirmish Bodies Abandoned wagons Dead horses A
burning farm

EXT CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAY

Marion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill A vista
spreads out before them They see an awesome sight -- A
MASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE
A battle is taking place about five miles away

Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him

MARION
No its too late

Gabriel stops Marion points out brightly colored
clusters of men behind each army

MARION
Command posts Patriot
British

The distant slash of red stops Marion and Gabriel hear
only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS

Then from a black mass of the side of the red slash a
sudden silent eruption of white smoke

An instant later the blue slash quivers A moment later
the SOUND OF THE CANNONS RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls
over Marion and Gabriel

The RED SLASH STOPS moving It darkens as thousands of
Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel
into firing position

Marions eyes dart He knows whats coming
MARION
Break for the trees break for the
trees

A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red
slash An instant later the blue line starts to break up
as hundreds of distant Patriots fall

The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and
Gabriel like the pattering of rain

Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts
from the Patriot lines The red line holds firm

MARION
Send them to cover Goddamn you

But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field

From behind the Redcoats FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES
move quickly onto the battlefield CAVALRY

GABRIEL
Father we have to do something

The British cavalry slams into the blue line shattering
it Tiny bits of blue move in every direction

GABRIEL
Father

MARION
Its already over

Marion watches appalled At this distance the moving
slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely
beautiful Marion turns his horse and heads down the
hill toward the rear of the Patriot lines

EXT AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A nightmare SCREAMS OF AGONY A few hundred battered
Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move
out The battle so bloodless and beautiful at a
distance has in its aftermath become horrifically
painful and ugly

Marion and Gabriel ride into camp passing nervous
sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools
of blood and amputated legs and arms Marion sees HARRY
LEE at a make-shift command post barking orders trying
to pull things together

LEE
Damn you Sergeant dont move the
wounded twice put them straight on
the wagons from the surgeons
PATRIOT SERGEANT
Yes sir

LEE
Lieutenant detail men for
outriders We move out as soon as
the wounded are ready

LIEUTENANT
Yes sir

The Lieutenant rushes off Lee notices Marion and
Gabriel surprised to see them He jerks his head for
them to follow him into

LEES COMMAND TENT

Once out of sight of the men Lee loses his command
bearing Exhausted he leans on his campaign table and
looks closely at Marion asking with his eyes why Marion
is here

MARION
Green Dragoons came to my home
killed my son Thomas It was
Tarleton himself

LEE
Im sorry

MARION
Im sorry I wasnt here for this

LEE
Theres nothing you could have done
Gates is a damned fool

MARION
We saw

LEE
I begged him to stay in the cover of
the trees but he insisted the only
way to break Cornwallis was muzzle-
to-muzzle He spent too many years
in the British army

MARION
Where is he now

LEE
Last anyone saw riding hard
northeast his staff a hundred yards
behind trying to catch up

MARION
Whos in command

LEE
I am I think

MARION
What are my orders

Lee gives Marion a tired smile

LEE
If you want orders Ive got some
for you

Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel

LEE
Were a breath away from losing this
war In the North Washington is
reeling from Valley Forge running
and hiding from Clinton and twelve
thousand Redcoats

(pointing)

Here in the South Cornwallis has
broken our back He captured over
five thousand of our troops when he
took Charleston and today he
destroyed the only army that stood
between him and New York

MARION
So now Cornwallis will head north
link up with Clinton and finish off
Washington

LEE

And Patriots will start dying on the
gallows instead of the battlefield

(beat)
Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the
South until the French arrive A
treaty was signed at Versailles
after our victory at Saratoga The
French are sending a fleet and ten
thousand troops

MARION
When

LEE
Fall six months at the earliest

MARION
Long time

LEE
The bigger problem is where not
when The French fleet wont sail
north of the Chesapeake for fear of
early storms

MARION
So youre going to try to keep
Cornwallis in the South until then

LEE
Not me you Im going north with
every Continental regular I can find
to reinforce Washington or he wont
last six weeks

MARION
You expect Cornwallis to be held
here by militia

LEE
Not held just slowed down

MARION
Theyre nothing but farmers and
youre asking them to try to keep a
tiger in their backyard Theyd be
better off letting it move on

LEE
Theyd be better off but the cause
wouldnt be

MARION
How many men does Cornwallis have
under his command

LEE
Four thousand infantry and around
six hundred cavalry
(beat)
including the Green Dragoons
under Tarleton

At the mention of Tarleton Marion nods

MARION
Ill do what I can

Lee quickly writes something
LEE
Im giving you a field commission as
a colonel

He hands it to Marion Gabriel steps forward

GABRIEL
Colonel Lee I request a transfer to
Colonel Marions command

LEE
Granted

Lee scribbles another order and hands it to Gabriel Then
he turns to Marion

Good luck
Marion nods They duck out of the tent
EXT AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT (LATER)

Marion and Gabriel stand watching Lee and his Continental
regulars move out Gabriel turns to Marion

GABRIEL
What now sir

MARION
We put out the word Well start

Santee

GABRIEL
Wed cover more ground if we split
up

MARION

Its safer if we stay together
Gabriel steps in front of Marion

GABRIEL
Colonel I didnt request this
transfer because youre my father
I requested it because I believe in
this cause and this is where I can
do the most good

MARION
Oh

GABRIEL

Continental Army the best horseman
the best shot the best scavenger
and I know every deer path and swamp
trail between here and Charleston

MARION

Marion looks at Gabriel closely

MARION

GABRIEL

As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of
Madeira on one of the tables He stops

of plant-choked water

Gabriel leads several men riding along a dry path that
snakes through the swamp They cross a narrow land bridge
onto a wooded island joining a dozen-and-a-half men
including Marion who kneels at a campfire

CLOSE SHOT Several of Thomas brightly painted LEAD
SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan The little men fall to
their knees then lose form turning into bubbling molten
metal

The new arrivals dismount and greet the others
Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the

lead into a bullet mold closes the lid and dips the mold
into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS

GABRIEL
Father this war is about more than
Thomas
Marion doesnt look up
MARION
Is it
GABRIEL

If youre here only for revenge
youre doing a disservice to him as
well as yourself

MARION
How old are you

GABRIEL
You know how old I am

MARION
God help us all when youre forty

Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan Gabriel
shakes his head turns away and goes to tend his horse

EXT SNOWS ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

Day breaks A low thick swamp mist covers the
encampment Marion sits alone by the embers of last
nights campfire The men are awake Some eat others
talk

Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie He takes
the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch
attached to his weapons belt Then he rises and heads
over to the men

He surveys his brigade Twenty-six men framers
artisans mountain men none in uniform Marion walks
among them nodding familiarly to several He notices an
imposing looking Cherokee Indian BROTHER JOSEPH standing
a bit apart from the others They exchange nods

He notices a stern-looking man in partial clerical garb
REV CHARLES OLIVER

MARION
Reverend

REV OLIVER
I heard about your son Im sorry

Marion accepts his condolences He notes GEORGE DALTON a
tough-looking rustic man with an ice-cold distant stare

MARION
Dalton

Dalton doesnt respond Marion recognizes another face
ABNER BROWN African-American around thirty rugged

Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much
as just give him their attention

MARION
You all have your own reasons for
being here I lost a son and I
intend to kill the man who killed
him

Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel

MARION
But I dont consider that mans
life adequate payment for the life
of my son and killing him wont
keep the sons of other men from
dying

Gabriel nods approvingly

MARION
Cornwallis has to move north We
have to keep him right here If
hes south of the Chesapeake when
the French arrive if the French
arrive we have a chance of winning
this war
Marion looks from face to face

MARION
Eat get some rest we move out in
two hours

Marion heads back to his campsite passing Gabriel without
looking at him but very aware of his sons eyes on him

Gentlemen

CORNWALLIS
Major this is not an adequate map

MAJOR HUNTINGTON
We have better coming on the
trailing supply convoy from
Charleston

A useful place for our maps

MAJOR HUNTINGTON
Im sorry Sir it wont happen
again

Tarleton enters followed by Wilkins

CORNWALLIS
My harrier Join us Colonel
TARLETON
Sir

Tarleton and Wilkins join them around the map

CORNWALLIS
Gentlemen celebration is premature
We have a difficult campaign ahead
of us We are in predominately
hostile country and we cannot rely
on forage As we move north the
bulk of our supplies will reach us
by sea through Charleston which
will give us a long and vulnerable
supply line one that can only be
secured if the locals are loyal to
the crown

CORNWALLIS OFFICERS
(multiple)
Yes sir

Cornwallis turns to his field officers paying particular
attention to Tarleton

CORNWALLIS
Nonetheless we must remember that
this is a civil war

Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis look

CORNWALLIS

These colonials are our brethren and
when this conflict is over we will
be reestablishing commerce with
them Surrendering troops will be
given quarter and unwarranted
assaults on civilians will cease

Wilkins shifts uneasily Tarleton isnt cowed

CORNWALLIS
I expect this war to be fought in a
vigorous but civilized manner

Cornwallis looks at his other officers

CORNWALLIS
Have I made myself clear gentlemen

OFFICERS
(multiple)
Yes sir

Cornwallis shifts his eyes back to Tarleton who was not
among those who spoke Tarleton pointedly pauses a
moment then says

gather around

Now all we need is an army

Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and
ROB FIELDING a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen They
overlap dialogue rapidly speaking the private language of
colonial artisans

SCOTT
Reamer boring tool

MARION
Swage broach etching tool

FIELDING
A rolling gunsmiths shop

SCOTT
We can rifle those musket barrels

FIELDING
Get another hundred yards out of

MARION
Weve got clay to make a chamber

FIELDING
Oak to make charcoal

SCOTT
Oil cloth and barrel staves to make
a bellows

MARION
And we can yank a wagon wheel
weight it rig a piston and drive
shaft and well have a flywheel to
power the bellows

Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look

SCOTT
(to Fielding)
Thats why hes a colonel

Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work
Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN
and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE
GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons

BILLINGS
Shoot them Shoot the damn things

Dalton prepares to do so

MARION
Put that pistol down

SCOTT
They followed us from the bridge
They wont let anyone near the
wagon

Marion steps forward speaking softly but firmly to the
dogs

MARION
Stay stay stay

The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his
throat

MARION
Dont you growl at me

The dogs decide to obey Marion lets them sniff his hand
then firmly pats them

MARION
Now lets see whats in this wagon

Rev Oliver and Abner join him Billings eases past the
dogs Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with
bottles

ABNER
Rum French Champagne Madeira
Port

BILLINGS

No wonder they were guarding it

Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered
wigs all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig-
stands Rev Oliver opens one of several identical cases
and finds it filled with papers

REV OLIVER
My heavens personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis

Marion grabs some papers scans them then finds matching
cases on nearby wagons

MARION
These four wagons must be his

GABRIEL
And the dogs too Ill wager

BILLINGS
I say we drink the wine shoot the
dogs and use the papers for musket

wadding

MARION
His journals letters maps
books

Abner calls from another wagon

ABNER
Colonel we got a wagon full of
officers uniforms and more powder
and muskets here

Ignoring Abner Marion sits down on a stump with a pile
of Cornwallis papers and starts to read

EXT SNOWS ISLAND - NIGHT

Marion sits at Cornwallis ornate folding campaign desk
reading Cornwallis journal surrounded by Cornwallis
field gear which includes furniture music boxes oil
paintings and an elaborate folding commode The TWO GREAT
DANES sit nearby eyeing Marion warily

The men have divided themselves into two groups one
coarse the other civilized each clustered around a
separate fire

The coarse men including Dalton Brother Joseph and
RANDOLPH a grizzled black-toothed mountain man drink
and laugh loudly wearing Cornwallis wigs askew

The civilized men including Rev Oliver Gabriel Scott
Fielding and Abner talk quietly

Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the
campfire where the rougher men are gathered He stands
just inside the firelight and speaks loudly so that all
can hear

MARION
Today was hard earned but a good
start

Marion looks at Dalton then turns to the other men as
well

MARION
In the future wounded British
soldiers will be given quarters

DALTON
Like they gave quarter to my family
My wife and three children were
hiding in our root cellar when they
came The Redcoats locked the door
and torched the house

MARION
You have my sympathy but the
order stands

DALTON
And who are you to give an order
like that We all know what you did
after Fort Wilderness

That hits home but Marion remains calm

MARION
Im your commanding officer This
is militia not regular army I

cant hold you here but as long as
you stay youll follow my orders

Marion looks from face to face Most begrudgingly nod
Thats enough for Marion
As he heads back to his own campfire hes intercepted by
Rev Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other
men except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear

REV OLIVER
Thank you

MARION
For what

REV OLIVER
For trying to impose some decency on
that sort

MARION
Dont depend on my decency Im one
of that sort

Marion walks on Rev Oliver exchanges a look with
Gabriel then heads off As Marion joins Gabriel and
Billings at his campfire Billings grips his bottle

BILLINGS
Am I one of that sort

MARION
Youre the worst of that sort
Youre the sort that gives that sort
a bad name

Billings considers that then shrugs and takes a long
drink He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally
long drink Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle

MARION
Im going to check the watch

He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and
Billings at the campfire

GABRIEL
He shouldnt make light That
Redcoat should not have been killed

BILLINGS
Hes not making light

Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look

BILLINGS
You dont know him very well do
you

GABRIEL

Hes my father
Billings looks closely at Gabriel

GABRIEL
I know him well enough

BILLINGS
Dont fault him for having grown up
on the frontier It was a harder
time and a harder place than you
know

Gabriel looks at Billings then turns back to the fire
EXT SNOWS ISLAND - DAWN

The men are beginning to stir gathering around the
campfires cooking using pots pans and other gear from
the stolen British wagons

Marion reads Cornwallis journal He looks up stretches

and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel Billings and
Rev Oliver cook The dogs follow at a distance

BILLINGS
Well

MARION
Ive just been inside the mind of a
genius Lord Cornwallis knows more
about war than I could in a dozen
lifetimes

BILLINGS

Cheerful news to greet the morn

MARION
His victories at Charleston and
Camden were perfect strategically
tactically logistically But he
has a weakness

They all turn to Marion
MARION
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant His

weakness is that he knows it

GABRIEL
Father

MARION
Pride is his weakness

The men consider that

BILLINGS
Personally Id prefer stupidity
MARION
Pride will do

The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the
garment with deepest disdain

CORNWALLIS
And what praytell is this

VALET
Uh I borrowed it from Colonel
North I took it in at the back
added wider epaulets a court sash
and looped gold braiding on the
cuffs

CORNWALLIS

Its a horse blanket

(to Major Halbert)
First my personal baggage then half
the bridges and ferries between here

against Colonial regulars or the
French when they come

COLONEL HALBERT
Sir theyre not like regulars we

when or where theyre going to
strike

CORNWALLIS
How impolite And who leads these
clever secretive fellows

the light -- THE DRUNKEN REDCOATS ARE BILLINGS AND DALTON

BILLINGS

DALTON
To hell with the officers and their
fancy dress ball

GUARD

the guards back against the building

Dalton DRAWS A KNIFE and PLUNGES IT into the second
guards belly and HACKS HIM OPEN
Dalton shoves Billings out of the way SLITS THE OTHER
GUARDS THROAT Billings is taken aback by the speed and
ferocity of Daltons attack

Marion and Scott duck into the shadows of the doorway

silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of
the heavy door

Billings and Dalton take the posts of the guards while the
other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight
Everything appears as it should

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Grand Opulent Cornwallis speaks with a small gathering
of loyalist civilians among whom is the spectacular MRS

gunpowder across the floor

EXT BALCONY - CAMDEN INN - NIGHT

MRS TALBOT
You seem far away
CORNWALLIS
Its the weight of command and the
lot of a widower -- memories

(with a self-
deprecating laugh)
» and long gazes at the moon

Mrs Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her
fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located
inches above her stunning cleavage

MRS TALBOT
Oh you poor man

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT as a FIREBALL
erupts from the armory British officers including Major
Halbert and Tarleton RUSH OUT along with Mr Talbot and
other Loyalist civilians

MAJOR HALBERT
Good God

Mr Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at
his wife clinging to Cornwallis arm

MR TALBOT
These rebels seem to lack fear as
well as decency eh General

Cornwallis registers the insult glances at the hapless
Major Halbert then turns to Tarleton

CORNWALLIS
Colonel Tarleton you deal with

these damned rebels

She gives him a bit of a smile He checks out her teeth

GABRIEL
They look nice As white as can be

She tries to glare but she cant help but laugh

MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some
apples which he tosses into the air one-by-one catching
them behind his back a cocky move executed with a
disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again Marion
smiles at his sons flirtation Billings smiles as well

BILLINGS
He reminds me of you before you got
old and ugly

MARION
(softly)
No he takes after his mother
Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marions
words

MARION
the younger ones barely remember
her but Gabriel spent more time with
Elizabeth she taught him well
guided him she was his North Star
and mine her father was a
minister in Boston did you know
that

Billings nods

MARION
Gabriels already a better man
than I could ever hope to be

Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel
adopting a coarse joking tone

MARION
What do you mean old and ugly

BILLINGS
You got me beat on both accounts

MARION
The hell I do

They mount up grateful to leave the sincerity behind

Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off He
says goodbye to Anne then RUNS TO HIS HORSE MOUNTING
WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP He GALLOPS up taking his place at
his fathers side Marion doesnt turn to look at him
but he knows hes there

EXT CAROLINA ROAD - DAY

A patchwork of fields with a village visible in the
distance The ROLLINS BOYS 10 and 12 work a field
harvesting grain Hearing the SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES
they stop and listen

Then they see a CLOUD OF DUST rising over the ridge line
Growing excited they throw down their scythes and race
down the hillside madly stumbling and falling trying to
intersect the approaching sound

At the bottom of the hill they pass their father BEN
ROLLINS who watches his sons plant themselves on the side
of the road gazing in awe at

MARION AND HIS MEN THUNDERING BY Theyre an impressive
sight a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men on powerful
mounts raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the
road

EXT CHARLESTON ROAD - DAY

Marion and forty of his men including Gabriel sit on
their motionless horses in the middle of the road There
are a number of new faces among Marions men among them

Pembroke and get some

BILLINGS
You got salt last week

GABRIEL
Oh right

Baking powder we need baking

Gabriel sighs They hear a SOUND APPROACHING then see
two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX
REDCOATS commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT The Redcoat
Sergeant signals stop

REDCOAT SERGEANT
Halt Look alive boys

The young Redcoat privates nervously UNSHOULDER THEIR
MUSKETS

MARION
Sergeant this road is closed
Those wagons now belong to the
Continental Army

REDCOAT SERGEANT
Ready arms By twos

Marions surprised by the Sergeants order

MARION
Sergeant theres no reason for you
and your men to die Just leave the
wagons and go
REDCOAT SERGEANT
Steady boys

Marion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE The
underbrush parts and more of Marions men show themselves
MUSKETS LEVELED at the outnumbered Redcoats

REDCOAT SERGEANT
This is the Kings highway and I
advise you and your men to make way
(to his men)
Prepare to fire

Marion exchanges a look with Rev Oliver who like Marion
doesnt want to kill these men Seeing no other option
Marion turns to give the order then stops hearing a
FAINT BARELY DETECTABLE RUMBLING SOUND

A moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well HORSES
HOOVES LOTS OF THEM growing louder by the second
THUNDERING toward them from the road behind the British
wagons

Then the SOUND OF MORE HORSES coming in fast on both
flanks

MARION
Its a trap

The canvas sides of the British wagons are THROWN UP and
DOZENS OF REDCOATS armed with muskets spill out

Marions unmounted men run to their horses LEAPING into
their saddles

Then GREEN DRAGOONS appear galloping down the wooded
slopes on both flanks astonishing horsemen weaving

through the trees without slacking their pace SWORDS
DRAWN PISTOLS PRIMED

REDCOAT SERGEANT
FIRE

A THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry
KILLING several of Marions men

Marions men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS most of
their shots going awry

Behind the British wagons a huge detachment of GREEN
DRAGOONS appears TARLETON among them

MARION SEES THE DRAGOONS BUT NOT TARLETON HIMSELF

MARION AND HIS MEN spur their mounts taking off down the
road in the opposite direction
The FLANKING BODIES OF DRAGOONS gallop out of the woods
JOINING THE MAIN BODY riding in hard pursuit

EXT WOODED ROAD - DAY

They ROUND A CURVE AND STOP reining back their horses in
confusion as they see

FIFTY GREEN DRAGOONS heading straight toward them

THE DRAGOONS OPEN FIRE from both directions KILLING
several more of Marions men WOUNDING others

Marions men FIRE BACK as best they can caught in the
CHAOS OF BUCKING AND FALLING HORSES and WOUNDED AND
DISMOUNTED MEN

They remount doubling-up with the wounded

MARION sees an unaided wounded man LEAPS FROM HIS
HORSE heaves him onto his horse slaps it

Marions men head off both sides of the road into the
swamp struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee-
deep water

Marion on foot with four men only three horses A
DRAGOON aiming his pistol THUNDERS down on Marion
MARION FIRES killing the Dragoon

Marions men mount one motions to Marion

MARION
Go

Marions men ride off leaving him ALONE a Dragoon is
almost on him SWORD RAISED Marion his weapon spent
sees a thick branch on the ground two feet long grabs
it

The sword flashes and SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE WOOD Marion
YANKS brings the rider off his horse grabs the reins and
SWINGS HIMSELF UP INTO THE EMPTY SADDLE Marion rides
down the embankment

The Dragoons rein back slowed by the dead horses and men
They spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and
follow Marion and his men into the swamp
EXT BLACK SWAMP - DAY

MARION RIDES HARD galloping along a circuitous barely
visible dry trail A MOMENT LATER Tarleton and Green
Dragoons follow

EXT DEEP IN THE SWAMPS - EVENING

MARION CATCHES UP to a dozen of his men including Gabriel
and Billings Several of the men are badly wounded
barely clinging to their saddles

They ride through the shallow water get to a fork SPLIT
UP As they disappear into the swamp the sounds of their
horses are swallowed up in the LOUD BUZZING OF SWAMP
INSECTS and the CRIES OF THE SWAMP BIRDS

A moment later Tarleton and the vanguard of Dragoons ride
up Tarleton signals stop at the fork

Looks nothing Listens nothing Chooses a path
the one Marion took Rides off the Dragoons following

EXT DEEPER IN THE SWAMPS - NIGHT

Darker still Tarleton and his men come to a dead end
blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn
bushes

They rein back their horses stopping in a confused mess
Tarleton calls to Gaskins and the Loyalist scouts

TARLETON
Which way
GASKINS
This way no this I think
Tarleton makes his own choice rides off the Green

Dragoons follow the Loyalists bring up the rear
EXT SWAMP MORASS - NIGHT

Tarleton and his mounted Dragoons struggle through a
nearly impassable morass of swamp-grass reeds and
swarming mosquitoes

The exhausted Dragoons are wet covered with mud and
bleeding from swamp briars The horses are spent and
foaming

Tarleton struggles harder than any but finally even he
has had enough He reins back his horse

TARLETON
HALT
Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant-
choked water and swamp

TARLETON
Enough of this There are other
ways to run down a fox

Tarleton yanks on his reins turns his horse and starts
back the way they came His grateful men turn their
horses and follow

IN THE UNDERGROWTH Marion Gabriel Billings and three
badly wounded men with only four horses between them
calm their mounts

They can hear but not see the Dragoons Then through
the thick undergrowth MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
TARLETON

Gabriel tending the wounded men sees his father lock his
eyes on Tarleton

Marion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one
of the bullets he made from Thomas lead soldiers
Walking to his horse Marion loads

Marion mounts scanning the terrain planning a route

GABRIEL
Father no

As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton Gabriel
grabs the bridle He YANKS HARD stopping Marions horse
dead THE HORSE BUCKS nearly throwing Marion

MARION
Thats him Tarleton

MARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but is
JERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel Marion angrily turns on his
son

MARION
Damn you Let go

Gabriel looks up at his father never loosening his iron
grip on the bridles but speaking softly almost
pleadingly

GABRIEL
Father please

Marion looks down at Gabriel Then Marion looks over at
Billings and the three wounded men

One bleeds from an ugly neck wound their shared mounts
are nearly spent
Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing
Tarleton Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the
wounded Gabriel watches his father for a moment then
joins him with the wounded

EXT WOODED GLEN - NIGHT

Dark Marion and his battered men gather taking stock
Men drift in mounted and on foot in ones and twos past
wary sentries GABRIEL RIDES UP dismounts and reports to
Marion out of earshot of the other men

GABRIEL
Fourteen dead eleven wounded
eighteen captured

MARION
I should have killed him when I had
the chance

GABRIEL
When was that In the swamp at the
expense of your men Or when he
killed Thomas at the expense of your
family

MARION
No

GABRIEL
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense
of our cause

Marion is silent

GABRIEL
There will be a time and a place for
revenge but killing Tarleton at the
expense of your duty serves no one
but yourself
(beat)
Stay the course

The parental-sounding formality of Gabriels words brings
a thin smile to Marions face

MARION
Stay the course your mother used
to say that to me when Id get drunk
or lose my temper

GABRIEL
Shed say it to me when I picked on

Thomas or Nathan

MARION
You learned her lessons better than

I

GABRIEL
She got me at a more impressionable
age

Marion smiles nods a silent thanks to his son and heads
over to help with the wounded

EXT MARIONS ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A cold winter rain falls Most of Marions grim men are
huddled in lean-tos and around campfires Green and
several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of
supplies while Marion Scott and Fielding stow the
provisions

Gabriel and Anne sit at a fire under the cover of a lean-
to taking quietly Hes troubled She tries to be
hopeful

ANNE
Next time well bring more blankets

GABRIEL
That would be nice

ANNE
Maybe well be lucky this winter and
have just rain no snow

GABRIEL
That would be nice too

She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of
tea

ANNE
Just because the French didnt come
this fall doesnt mean theyre
never going to come

He nods and takes a drink of the tea She smiles
Gabriel smiles back to her revealing a mouthful of ink-
stained black teeth Before she has time to laugh

ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP Marion hurries over
accompanied by the Great Danes The other men gather
around

ROLLINS
Theyre to be hung

GABRIEL
But theyre prisoners-of-war
Marion isnt as surprised as Gabriel He is however
taken aback by Gabriels black teeth Gabriel notices
everyone looking at his mouth

Anne is embarrassed and regretful seeing her joke fly in
the face of the troubling news

EXT FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride out
of distant woods Its Rev Oliver carrying a white flag
with one hand holding a dispatch case in the other The
sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch

REDCOAT SENTRY
Sir

INT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered
farmhouse Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor
measures him and marks alterations on a partially
completed uniform Tarleton enters

TARLETON
General a message from the
commander of the rebel militia

Cornwallis reads the message
CORNWALLIS
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have

a formal parley

TARLETON
Are you going to meet with him

CORNWALLIS
Most certainly Arrange it

EXT CAROLINA ROAD - DAY

Marion rides trailed by Cornwallis Great Danes Behind
him two dozen heavily armed Patriots including Rev
Oliver who carries a white flag

A detachment of Redcoat Cavalry lead by Major Halbert
waits The Redcoats fall in on either side They ride
on

EXT FORT CAROLINA - DAY
Redcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoats
and open the gates Billings and the other Patriots stop

a hundred yards outside the barricades

MARION alone rides through the gates flanked by the
British cavalry the Great Danes following closely behind
INT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Major Halbert ushers Marion in The Great Danes follow
sniffing curiously sensing something or someone

MAJOR HALBERT
Lord Cornwallis will be with you
presently

MARION
Thank you

MAJOR HALBERT
You may of course keep your
weapons but I must warn you that

MARION
(interrupting)
Im familiar with appropriate
behavior at a military parley

MAJOR HALBERT
Yes quite but you should know
that

MARION
That will be all Major Ill wait
for Lord Cornwallis

MAJOR HALBERT
(coldly)
Yes you will wait

Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out

MARION
One other thing

Major Halbert stops

MARION
The proper form of address to a
superior officer even one of an
opposing army is Yes sir

Major Halbert sneers and strides from the room MARION
ALONE EXCEPT FOR THE DOGS allows himself a fleeting
smile Then he looks around the room He notes a rocking
chair Curious he hefts it Too heavy He puts it
down sits and rocks The dogs walk over and lay at his
feet

INT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY (LATER)

Marion patiently sits rocking One of the dogs has its
head in his lap and Marion scratches it behind the ears
DISSOLVE TO
INT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A stone-faced Marion stands in the center of the room

playing with the dogs One of the dogs jumps up putting
its front legs on Marions shoulders and licks his face
Just then Cornwallis walks in overjoyed to see his dogs

CORNWALLIS
Jupiter Mars

The dogs just look at Cornwallis He holds out his arms
waiting for them to rush to him They look up at Marion
who nods to them

MARION
Go

The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly
but not enthusiastic manner Cornwallis pats them
vigorously too vigorously for the moderate level of joy
the dogs are showing at their reunion

CORNWALLIS
My boys my boys you seem to
have been well fed Thank you for
that Colonel

MARION
My pleasure sir

CORNWALLIS
Please forgive me for keeping you
waiting

MARION

Apology accepted
CORNWALLIS
Thank you Colonel Im afraid I

dont know your name

MARION
Colonel will do

CORNWALLIS
As you wish

TARLETON ENTERS with four Dragoons all armed
Marion freezes

Marion and Tarleton lock eyes Marion searches for some
sign that Tarleton recognizes him Theres none
CORNWALLIS

Colonel Colonel Banastre
Tarleton
Tarleton nods
TARLETON
Colonel

Marion like ice looks Tarleton up and down Then he
slowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons two on either
side of Tarleton Marion measures the odds and finds them
wanting

With a supreme effort of will Marion forces himself to
turn from Tarleton to Cornwallis and the matter at hand

MARION
Shall we proceed

CORNWALLIS
Let us Unless you object I would
like to deem this meeting a formal
negotiation and as such there are
certain customary practices
Perhaps I could explain them to
you

MARION
Im familiar with how a formal
negotiation is handled

CORNWALLIS
Oh

MARION
I served in His Majestys army in
the French and Indian War

CORNWALLIS
Oh Very well then Would you as
the initiating party like to begin

MARION
Unless you would like to claim
aggrieved status

Cornwallis is surprised He exchanges a look with
Tarleton

CORNWALLIS
You are familiar with how these
things are done In fact I would
like to claim aggrieved status

MARION
Very well proceed sir

CORNWALLIS
First you have in your possession
certain belongings of mine
including clothing private papers
furniture and personal effects of a
non-military nature which I would
like to have returned to me

MARION
I will do so as soon as possible

Cornwallis is surprised

CORNWALLIS
Thank you

MARION
Please accept my apology for not
having done so sooner

CORNWALLIS
Apology accepted Now on the
matter of the specific targeting of
officers during engagements this is
absolutely unacceptable

MARION
That one is a bit more difficult

CORNWALLIS
Certainly you must know that in
civilized warfare officers in the
field must not be accorded
inappropriate levels of hostile
attention

MARION
And what are inappropriate levels of
hostile attention

CORNWALLIS
Colonel imagine the utter chaos
that would result from un-led armies
having at each other There must be
gentlemen in command to lead and
when appropriate restrain their
men

MARION
Restrain them from the targeting of
civilians including women and
children

CORNWALLIS
That is a separate issue
MARION
I consider them linked

CORNWALLIS
I beg to differ One is a command
decision on your part The other
represents nothing more than the
occasional over-exuberance of field
officers attempting to carry out
their duty in difficult
circumstances

MARION
As long as your soldiers attack
civilians I will order the shooting
of your officers at the outset of
every engagement
(beat)
And my men are excellent marksmen

Cornwallis sighs

CORNWALLIS
Very well let us move on to

MARION
Prisoner exchange

CORNWALLIS
Sir

MARION
You have eighteen of my men I want
them back

CORNWALLIS

I do have eighteen criminals under
sentence of death but I hold no
prisoners-of-war

MARION
If thats your position then
eighteen of your officers will die
Nineteen if you hang me with my
men

CORNWALLIS
What officers

Marion steps to the window checks the view A wooded
hillside is visible in the distance Marion reaches into
his jacket

The Dragoons move on him

Marion extracts not a weapon but a spyglass which he
hands to Cornwallis

MARION
In the clearing just down from the
crest to the left of the dark
pines

Cornwallis looks through the spyglass
VIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASS

Though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering
haze Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat
officers with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their
heads

CORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion

CORNWALLIS
Their names ranks and posts

MARION
They refused to give me their names
Their ranks are nine lieutenants
five captains three majors and one
fat colonel who called me a cheeky
fellow Their posts We picked
them up here-and-there last night

Cornwallis glares at Marion

CORNWALLIS
You are not a gentleman

Marion cant help but laugh at the insult

MARION
If your conduct is the measure of a
gentleman I take that as a
compliment
(coldly)
Get my men

Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington

CORNWALLIS
Arrange the exchange

Colonel Huntington leaves to do so
MARION
Thank you General Im sure your
officers will thank you as well

Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesnt return the salute

THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON He walks up to him and
looks him in the eye

MARION
You dont remember me do you

Tarleton examines Marions face finding him familiar but
unable to place him then Tarleton remembers

TARLETON
Ah yes that boy

Tarleton calmly holds Marions glare

TARLETON
Ugly business doing ones duty

MARION
Yes ugly business

Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton then speaks very
softly very slowly very clearly

MARION
If you are alive when this war is
over Im going to kill you

Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly
clear that he means what he says Tarleton tries to cover
his reaction but its apparent that hes taken aback by
Marions icy words

Marion turns and walks out The two Great Danes start to
follow but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND

CORNWALLIS
Jupiter Mars

THE DOGS FREEZE looking after Marion who doesnt turn
back The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis
side

EXT ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

Redcoats glare at Marion who sits mounted waiting His
eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and
directed to waiting horses Surprised to be freed they
mount up

CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of
Cornwallis headquarters and watch as Marion and his men
ride toward the gate

THE TWO GREAT DANES watch Marion from Cornwallis side
Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE

GATES They do so and Marion and his men without
hurrying ride out
Then just as the gates are closing behind him Marion
without turning around lets loose with a PIERCING
WHISTLE

THE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION making
through the gates just as theyre closing

CORNWALLIS seeing his dogs run after Marion SPUTTERS
then turns and storms back into his quarters

TARLETON still off-balance from Marions parting
statement watches Marion ride away Then he turns to

Major Wilkins who stands nearby

TARLETON
Take a detachment and go get our
officers
Wilkins hurries off

EXT HILLSIDE CLEARING - ABOVE FORT CAROLINA - DAY

Major Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up
the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that

Cornwallis saw through the spyglass As the Dragoons ride
out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead seeing

more than SCARECROWS IN REDCOAT UNIFORMS Theres no sign

of Marion or his men
INT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

warmth

TARLETON
They cant be far Check the
outbuildings and the woods

The Dragoons race outside
EXT CHARLOTTES HOUSE - NIGHT

A TORCH BURNS A dozen Dragoons light torches off of it
and fan out to search The thick fog turns the torches
into diffused floating balls of light turning the
Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions

CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES carried by a
particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of
the underbrush closest to the house As the torch moves
its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the
underbrush

The CAMERA STOPS to reveal in the brush TWO FACES
GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE dark motionless watching the
search Behind them MARIONS OTHER CHILDREN Nathan
Samuel Margaret William and Susan
Around them SEVERAL MORE OF MARIONS MEN including ABNER
BROWN weapons ready The moving lights play on their
faces

AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE the torches converge
illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order The
torches fan out and begin SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE BARNS
AND OUTBUILDINGS

all ease back disappearing into the brush

EXT SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

A compound of rude shacks built of scraps of lumber and
rough-hewn logs stands on the side of the Magpie River

Marions men wait with the children while Abner Charlotte
and Gabriel flanked by Aaron and Abigail Marions
middle-aged black servants seen in the opening sequence
talk with several stern-looking middle-aged black
FREEDMEN

The conversation which is out of the childrens earshot
is testy with one of the middle-aged freedmen
particularly troubled

Marions stone-faced children look around appraising
their surroundings registering the poverty of the shanty
town

THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guarded
exchange of handshakes Gabriel Charlotte Abner Aaron
and Abigail rejoin the children and Marions men

GABRIEL
Its all set

They follow Aaron down an alley to A SHACK Small
Barely standing The children stop in their tracks
knowing this is to be their new home

Charlotte sees their hesitation She walks up to the
little structure examining it with a critical eye She
looks on the doorway seeing a single room a dirt floor
wax-paper instead of glass in the windows a rude
chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall She smiles

CHARLOTTE
This will do fine

She turns to Aaron and Abigail

CHARLOTTE
Thank you

Charlotte walks inside without looking back The children
hesitate then follow her inside
INT SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

The children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out of
armloads of hay OUTSIDE Charlotte and Gabriel talk
quietly

CHARLOTTE
So hes the one they talk about the
Swamp Fox

and pieces we heard a veteran
fought in the French and Indian War
knows the swamps

GABRIEL
They wont stop looking for you and
the children

CHARLOTTE
Well be alright here for now
(beat)
How is he

Gabriel searches for an honest answer

GABRIEL
I dont know Im his son

Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags opens his pack and
pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte

GABRIEL
These are for you and the children

They sense someone behind them

SUSAN
Why didnt father come

Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his
heretofore silent sister Charlotte nods smiling

CHARLOTTE
Speaking for months now

SUSAN

GABRIEL
He wanted to Susan but he couldnt
leave his men

SUSAN
He left us

GABRIEL
I know he did and hes sorry Hell

Susan says nothing Gabriel continues hopefully

GABRIEL
There are some letters here from
him Some are just to you

SUSAN
I dont care I hate him

GABRIEL
You dont hate him

SUSAN
Yes I do I hate him and I hope he
never comes back

Gabriel kneels down and embraces her She stands coldly
with her arms at her sides

EXT MARIONS ENCAMPMENT - DAY
An astonished Marion talks to Gabriel

MARION
She spoke Susan spoke

GABRIEL
Full sentences As if she had been
speaking all along

MARION
I dont believe it and I wasnt
there for it
The cloud passes quickly
MARION

Tell me everything she said word
for word

Gabriel hesitates

GABRIEL
She said she loves you and misses
you but she understands why you
cant be there with her

MARION
She said that Oh my Lord she said
that

Gabriel nods

MARION
Isnt that something

Marion shakes his head at the thought smiling to himself
Gabriel uncomfortable with the lie changes the subject

GABRIEL
Father theres something else I
need to talk to you about

MARION
What

GABRIEL
Come with me Ill tell you when we
get there

Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel

the church

INT CHURCH - PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Marion walks in and stops dead At the altar of the small
sanctuary HALF-A-DOZEN PEOPLE stand with Rev Oliver At
the center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green flanked by
her parents

GABRIEL
Father Im looking for a best man

Marion is stunned but recovers quickly

MARION
Id be honored

They share a moment then head down the aisle Marion
greets Annes parents shaking hands with her father and
bowing to her mother Abner at the door nods that the
coast is clear

REV OLIVER
Dearly beloved we are gathered here
in the sight of God to join this man
and this woman in holy matrimony

MARION feels every word looking straight ahead but
knowing that hes standing next to his son
EXT CHURCH - NIGHT

In the shadows behind the church the bride and groom say
goodbye to the wedding party Anne talks quietly with her
parents Marion and Gabriel talk nearby

Gabriel nods then turns to his horse unnecessarily
checking his pack ropes Anne joins them Marion
embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss

ANNE

warning

MARION

He helps her mount up Abner on guard near the road

off

EXT WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

Marion Rev Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road
Its a beautiful moonlit night Marion breaks the
silence speaking as much for himself as the others

MARION
Its a good measure of a woman that

REV OLIVER
For richer for poorer in sickness
and in health til death do they
part

Marion nods They ride on
EXT SOUTH CAROLINA SHORE - DAY

A British packet a small fast warship lies anchored
just offshore A rowboat manned by half-a-dozen sailors
carrying a Redcoat Lieutenant beaches Several Redcoats
wait

The Lieutenant carrying a dispatch case jumps out off
the boat mounts a waiting horse and rides off

EXT SMALL BRITISH FORT - DAY

Cornwallis with his command staff clustered around him
sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch
rider waits Theyre on a hillside looking over the
burned-out remains of a small British fort as some
Redcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine

Cornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards from
the other officers and speak out of earshot

CORNWALLIS

From General Clinton in New York

(reading)
your request to move north is
denied until you have properly dealt
with your militia problem

(aside)
He underlined militia

(reading)
You have spent over six months
dealing with a six-week problem It
is essential that you quell the

militia
(aside)
Underlined again
(reading)

insurgency particularly
because of the likely move south of
Washington and the inevitable
arrival of the French Militia as
you have so often pointed out is
not worth the attention of a
significant army hence it is
mystifying why militia has bedeviled
you for so long

Tarleton smiles slightly enjoying the show
CORNWALLIS

(reading)
it is my fervent hope that the
vigor of your campaign comes to
match the vigor of your
correspondence with your
Parliamentary and Court patrons
Only then might you share in the
victory on the verge of which I now
stand

(beat)
Your guardedly respectful
Commander General Sir George
Clinton

Cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton

CORNWALLIS
If I fail you fail

TARLETON
Perhaps

CORNWALLIS
And if I triumph you triumph

TARLETON
Probably

CORNWALLIS
How can we end this madness

TARLETON
Difficult sir This is as you
pointed out a civil war

Cornwallis takes a moment then speaks simply

CORNWALLIS
Civility is a secondary virtue It
is superseded by duty

TARLETON
I understand sir

Tarleton salutes yanks his reins turning his horse and
rides off

EXT SMALL FARMHOUSE - SUNSET

Tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a
farmhouse looking out at a lovely sunset absentmindedly
picking at the petals of some wildflowers A HIDEOUS
SCREAM pierces the calm

Tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream
then rises passing several Green Dragoons who wait with
their horses in front of the farmhouse

TARLETON
I believe they are almost ready

IN THE FARMHOUSE

Blood is smeared on one wall where half-a-dozen corpses
lie in a jumbles mass on the floor

In the parlor Tarleton walks past more bodies including
a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over
the bloody bodies of her two young children both under

eight-years-old

In the kitchen Tarleton finds Wilkins some Green
Dragoons and Gaskins the Loyalist Militia commander and
some of his low-life men

Rob Fielding one of the craftsmen in Marions force is
tied spread-eagle to the table showing the terrible
effects of PROTRACTED TORTURE Wilkins and Gaskins are
nervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room

GASKINS
Im sorry Sir He died

Tarleton sighs irritated

TARLETON
Very well get one of the others

Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached
woodshed where Billings sits bound They roughly grab
him and drag him into the kitchen

BILLINGS
Damn your eyes Do your worst

TARLETON
I intend to

They tie Billings to the table

INT SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY

Silence A tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in
the floor disappearing into a gap between two

floorboards

Marion Dalton Rev Oliver and several other men walk
slowly through the farmhouse in stunned silence

Marion sees the body of the mother draped over her two
young children Marion turns to Rev Oliver who can only
stare offering no solace
They pass Fieldings body then enter the kitchen and see
BILLINGS DEAD still tied to the table Marion reels

EXT SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY

Marions men dig graves Marion watches Dalton steps up
next to him

DALTON
You still want me to give wounded
Redcoats quarter

Marion doesnt answer Gabriel GALLOPS up He reins back
his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting

GABRIEL
Tarleton has a list of our men most
are on it A regiment of dragoons
is going to the homes on the list
burning them killing whomever
resists women and children as

well
MARION
Where
GABRIEL
Seven homes along the Black River so
far

Rollins doesnt pause He rushes to his horse mounts up
and rides off Marion and the other men mount up and ride
off fast after him

EXT BLACK RIVER ROAD - DAY

Marion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on with
him

EXT ROLLINS FARM - DAY

The small farm seen earlier surrounded by hills where
the two boys Rollins sons ran down the hillside to catch
a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade

The house smolders No sign of life Gabriel Abner and
a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared
area around the house

Marion at the head of the rest of the brigade waits next
to an increasingly frantic Rollins They see Gabriel
wave Signaling all clear

MARION ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house
Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES Horrified he
reins back and dismounts almost falling
His TWO SONS WIFE an OLDER MAN and WOMAN lie dead in
the dirt Marions men silently watch Rollins agony
Weeping and confused he moves in a mad staccato manner
as if he were a marionette whose strings were being
jerked by a drunken puppeteer

Marion and Rev Oliver dismount and move toward him
Rollins sees them coming He hardens and strides to his
horse pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle
holster

Rev Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins

REV OLIVER
Its not time for vengeance its
time to mourn and

ROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER
BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT

Every man freezes in place For a long moment no one
moves no one speaks Then Marion pulls himself together
and addresses the men

MARION
Five day furlough for all men
Abner Dan Reverend spread the
word Well reform at Acworth Any
man who doesnt come back wont be
thought a coward or uncommitted to
the cause Attend to your families

The men mount up Marion and Gabriel ride off together
EXT PEMBROKE - NIGHT

Marion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up The
three of them ride off pulling a line of horses some
heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty
mounts

EXT SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

Dark Quiet Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while
Marion cocks his musket checks his pistols and walks
slowly toward the shack

He warily checks every shadow No one anywhere Then a
SOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER immediately followed by

MARGARET (0S)
Its him I told you it was him

MARIONS CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion Hes
practically bowled over as Margaret Nathan Samuel and
William fling themselves into his arms
NATHAN
Father

WILLIAM
Papa

CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS watching the reunion
as Marion covers the children with kisses trying to hug
all of them at once as they cling to him as if theyll
never let go MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the
heads of the children

MARION
Thank you

Charlotte smiles Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out
from behind Charlottes patched and mended skirt He
kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesnt
move

He smiles to her and speaks softly

MARION
Susan

She looks coldly at Marion tightens her grip on
Charlottes skirt and retreats further behind her Marion
looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance

Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces
of his other children

EXT CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHT

Marion rides leading his children Charlotte and Anne up
a steep narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded
hillside

EXT CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

The remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm The
house is gone leaving only an overgrown cellar hole

Nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed one end of which
has fallen to the ground A SOFT WIND WHISTLES AND
WHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the
structure

Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing A
MOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby startling him He looks
back at the children worried anticipating a negative
reaction Margaret smiles and turns to the other
children speaking for Marions benefit

MARGARET
I told you things would get better

The children smile and dismount
INT TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT

POURING RAIN The ceiling drips Marion lies awake
with his children huddled against him sleeping in one of
the few dry spots Theyre covered with tattered quilts

On the other side of the children Charlotte is also
awake She and Marion exchange a long silent look in the
darkness over the heads of the sleeping children

EXT WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAY

Marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan
and Samuel They listen carefully

MARION

The overlook up there should be
where you post the watch Work out
a schedule Short watches
especially at night

(pointing)
If you can catch some of those
mockingbirds you can make cages and
put them along there for alarms

(motioning for them

to follow)
Now lets find someplace to cache
extra weapons

They follow Marion like soldiers
EXT CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair She
takes her time touching him on the head and shoulders
extending the process Marion sits back enjoying it
He notices Susan nearby watching silently He smiles
She turns away

EXT TOBACCO SHED - CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Dark Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the
roof Marion standing in the shadows senses someone
coming He freezes

A figure rounds the corner Its William MARION
YELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT then chases his father
around the corner tagging him They laugh Marion
covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide

EXT CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAY
Marion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids

looking at him Using the knife weve seen him use in
battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them
MARION
Good apple

No response

MARION
Very good Sweet

He cuts a slice and offers it to her She doesnt take
it He puts the slice between them After a long moment
she picks it up but as shes about to eat it she stops
seeing something on it She puts it back

Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red
splotch on it He looks at his knife and realizes that
its dried blood

Off-balance he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead
a thousand miles from Marion

EXT CHERAW FALLS RIVER - DAY

Marion washes the knife carefully almost obsessively
Anne steps up behind him

ANNE
May I ask you a question

Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without
explanation

MARION
Yes of course

She speaks with a sly withheld smile

ANNE
Do you think Frances with an e is
too manly a name for a girl

MARION
No

ANNE
Do you think Francis with an i is

too womanly a name for a boy

MARION
No

ANNE
Good

Anne smiles and walks away Marion figures out what she
just told him

MARION
When

ANNE
Late summer

MARION
Congratulations

ANNE
Thank you

Marion laughs at the thought
EXT CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marions children swim and play with the two Great Danes

in the pond at the base of the falls along with Gabriel

and Anne Marion and Charlotte sit on the bank watching
them

Charlotte turns and looks at Marion for a long moment
Hes unaware As Charlotte looks at him her smile

disappears replaced by anger She snaps at Marion

CHARLOTTE
Im not my sister

Startled Marion turns to Charlotte

MARION
Excuse me

CHARLOTTE
I said Im not my sister

MARION
I know that

CHARLOTTE
Do you

MARION

Of course I do

CHARLOTTE
(irritated)
Very well then

She turns from him Marion tries to figure out what just
happened After a long moment he gets it Stunned at
first his gears turn After a very thoughtful moment he
turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile She
rolls her eyes

EXT CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

Dark A full moon shines
INT TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT

Marion wakes He looks across his sleeping children and
sees that Charlotte isnt in her place on the other side
of them He rises and walks out into the night

EXT GLEN - CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

Marion walks into the glen He tenses sensing someone in
front of him Then he sees CHARLOTTE AT THE EDGE OF THE
WOODS Neither one speaks

They walk silently to each other They stop looking at
each other closely as if seeing one another for the first
time

Only then do they kiss The kiss grows more passionate
then much more passionate

EXT CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion finishes tying his gear onto his horse The
children are silent He stands beside his horse One
after another the children walk to him and embrace him --
Nathan Samuel Margaret William

He sees Susan standing next to Charlotte He motions to
her but she doesnt move Then he kneels down and gently
hugs her

MARION
Just a little goodbye One word
Thats all I want to hear

Susan remains silent standing with her arms at her sides
not responding to the embrace

Finally Marion lets go of her She just stares at him
Marion stands and turns to Charlotte

MARION
Goodbye Charlotte

CHARLOTTE
Goodbye

They embrace Though the hug is chaste their eyes tell a
different story Only Anne and Margaret notice but to
them its as clear as a bell They exchange a knowing
look

Marion and Charlotte break apart self-consciously

Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away As
theyre about to round a curve and disappear SUSAN CRIES
OUT

SUSAN
Papa

With halting steps then faster and faster she runs down
the path toward Marion

SUSAN
Papa dont go Ill say anything

Marion stops turning in his saddle to see Susan running
after him her eyes filled with tears

SUSAN
Please Papa Ill say anything you
want

Marion yanks his reins turning his horse

SUSAN
Just tell me what to say Tell me
what to say

Marion spurs his horse straight toward her GALLOPING
toward the running crying child

SUSAN
Please Papa please dont go

MARION RIDES TOWARD HER

Charlotte Anne and Marions children watch as

MARION LEANS OVER IN THE SADDLE without slowing down
SWOOPING HER INTO HIS LAP

She sits astride the saddle facing him her arms wrapped
around him pleading the words tumbling from her as fast
as she can get them out

SUSAN
» Ill talk to you Ill say
anything you want just tell me what
you want me to say Ill say
anything I promise please Papa
just stay

Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl holding her
letting her cry fighting his own tears

He reins back the horse stopping in front of the
others

He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the
horse to take Susan
Marion gives Susan a final embrace and covers her face
with kisses

MARION
Ill come back I promise

Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte

Marion in agony averts his eyes yanks his reins and
spurs his horse

As he rides away the children take off after him running

Susan seeing the others running after Marion struggles
out of Charlottes arms and runs after them as well

Marion rides now joined by Gabriel faster and faster
leaving a trail of dust

The children slow then stop one after another watching
as they ride away

EXT PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - ACWORTH - EVENING

Grim The most rudimentary of the encampments weve seen
Rain pours Some of Marions men huddle under lean-tos
and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial
protection from the cold rain

Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire
going Rev Oliver tries to cook

Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount Marion joins
Rev Oliver

MARION
How many came back

REV OLIVER
About a hundred and twenty Less
than a third

Marion nods He and Gabriel join some of the men under
one of the lean-tos

EXT RIVERSIDE - DAY

The rain has stopped The ground is still wet Its
spring The first buds are on the maple trees A fox
tentatively comes out of its winter den followed by a
pair of pups

Marion stands on the side of a river looking up at a
chevron of Canadian geese flying north

EXT PEMBROKE - DAY
The Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her
fathers store tying food and provisions to a couple of
packhorses A mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock

Suddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see
HALF-A DOZEN REDCOATS Shes initially frightened but the
REDCOAT SERGEANT speaks politely

REDCOAT SERGEANT
Excuse me Maam everyone has been
requested to gather at the church

ANNE
Everyone

REDCOAT SERGEANT
Colonel Tarleton wants to address
the whole village

The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to
follow him and his men She sees several other
townspeople with Redcoat escorts already heading down
the street She follows along

EXT PEMBROKE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Tarleton and Wilkins on horseback watch as a large
mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry
directs the villagers into the church

One of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a
bowl of gumdrops As he starts giving them to a few of
the children their parents waver unsure of the gesture
but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy

The townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of
the Redcoats who though carry muskets are polite and
unthreatening

REDCOAT
Into the church please

ANOTHER REDCOAT
Colonel Tarleton wishes to address
all of you

Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the
church He nods to the Redcoats near the door

The Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS chaining them shut The
DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside

VOICE
Open this door

ANOTHER VOICE
By what right are we made prisoners

TARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who along with several rough-
looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN disappear into the blacksmith
shop They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES
and approach the church

Several Redcoats see whats about to happen and are
appalled Even some of the Green Dragoons including
Wilkins are troubled Wilkins rides over to Tarleton

WILKINS
Sir

TARLETON
Yes Major

Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church
torches ready waiting for the final go-ahead from
Tarleton The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church
grows louder

WILKINS
Sir there is no honor in this

TARLETON
The honor is found in the end not
the means This will be forgotten
(to Gaskins)
Proceed

The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers The Redcoat
officers turn to Wilkins who struggles with himself
Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins distress

Finally Wilkins accepts it Weakly steadying his horse
he takes his place next to Tarleton

The Redcoats and Dragoons follow his lead and watch as

Gaskins and the Loyalist Militiamen light the church on
fire heaving their torches onto the roof through the

windows and under the raised foundation

SCREAMS are heard from inside The DOOR THUDS with the
shoulders of men trying to escape The CHAINS HOLD

As the FLAMES RISE another group of Loyalist Militiamen
and some Redcoats drag half-a-dozen young women out of a

side-street

Among the women desperately pleading kicking and
screaming is ANNE

The men drag her and the other women into the livery
stable

Tarleton watches them carried off stone-faced
Then he turns and watches the church go up in FLAMES
A WINDOW SHATTERS with a chair heaved from inside

SOME MEN TRY TO CLIMB OUT but waiting Redcoats FIRE THEIR
MUSKETS POINT BLANK

KILLING THREE MEN driving the others back

The SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE CHURCH grow louder

The FLAMES AND SMOKE RISE

EXT WOODS - PEMBROKE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

SILENCE A dark forest of old growth trees No
underbrush Marion and a couple dozen of his men
including Gabriel Rev Oliver and Dalton ride warily on
a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke
visible over the treetops in the distance

With hand signals Marion directs his men to fan out

They do so weaving through the dark forest weapons
ready

EXT PEMBROKE - DAY

Marion and his men slowly ride into Pembroke The remains
of the church smolder only slightly The town is
deserted no one dead or alive is visible

Unsure what they have found Marion and his men spread out
and dismount warily checking out the buildings looking

for some sign of life

Rev Oliver and a few other men head for the charred
remains of the church

Side-stepping some still-hot charred beams Rev Oliver
looks through the rubble

Then he sees the bodies
THE CAMERA CATCHES ONLY A FLEETING GLIMPSE of

Dozens of charred blackened bodies intertwined with the
remains of the church

Rev Oliver staggers from the rubble
The other men see what he has seen

One-by-one Marion and his men walk over and look into the
remains of the church

Marion see several charred hands extended through a
shattered window as if grasping for escape one of the
hands is tiny A CHILDS HAND

Marion is stunned
No one says a word

Dalton and a few of the other men continue the search
weapons ready

They step into the livery stable then walk out a moment
later ashen faced

Dalton speaks quietly to Marion motioning toward an
increasingly frantic Gabriel who has just found Annes
packhorses

Gabriel notices the gesture he watches Marion walk into
the livery stable Growing more nervous by the second

Gabriel hurries after his father

GABRIEL
Anne

As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable
Marion walks out and intercepts him

MARION
Dont go in there

GABRIEL
Is it her Is Anne in there

MARION
She is Dont go in there

Gabriel understands he reels growing faint Marion
grabs him keeping him from falling

Marion holds Gabriel who begins to weep

EXT PEMBROKE - DAY

Marions men led by Rev Oliver tend to the dead Some
dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the
church Others carry out the grim task of pulling the
charred bodies out of the rubble

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN

Marion sits alone Gabriel walks up behind him

GABRIEL
Father tell me what happened at
Fort Wilderness

MARION
You know what happened

GABRIEL
No I dont

MARION
Everyone knows Its what made me a
hero Me Harry Lee all of us I
got a medal Men bought me drinks
They still do sometimes Everyone
knows what happened

GABRIEL
Tell me what everyone doesnt know

MARION
And what do they know

GABRIEL
That the French and Cherokees
captured the fort and when you
retook it you took revenge on them
for what they did during the
occupation

MARION
Thats right

GABRIEL
Thats not enough Tell me

MARION
Your mother asked me the same
question around the time you were
born I was drunk and I was foolish
enough to answer her

Marion shakes his head to himself

MARION
Thats why it was four years between
you and Thomas It took me that
long to regain her respect

GABRIEL
Im not my mother I cant have the
respect without the knowing

Marions quiet for a moment Then he speaks

MARION
It was in 63 It was a bad time
The French and the Cherokee had
raided along the Blue Ridge All
the English settlers took refuge at
Fort Wilderness but the French
captured it We were sent in
relief Harry Lee Billings sixty
of us We already had something of
a reputation for being harsh
When we got there the fort was
abandoned Not a French soldier or
Cherokee anywhere They had left a
week earlier What we found was
bad

Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad

MARION
They had left the settlers there
The men had been burned alive the
women were in pieces and the
children were on stakes

Marions silent for a moment

MARION
We buried them then we went to
track It was a cold trail and they
were moving fast We went faster
We caught up to them at Kentucky
Ford

GABRIEL
Go on

MARION

We took our time with them and gave
every one of them worse than they
had given at the fort It was two
weeks before they were all dead all
except two We put the heads on a
pallet and had the two we let live
take it to the French at Fort
Ambercon

(beat)
The eyes fingers and tongues we put
in a basket and sent that down the
Asheulot to the Cherokee
(beat)
The French stayed east of the Blue
Ridge after that and the Cherokee
broke their treaty with the French
and stayed out of the fight
(beat)
That seemed to make a difference
The war went another year things
went better and men bought us
drinks

Gabriel is silent Marion looks at him closely

MARION
It was a different time son And
youre a better man than that

GABRIEL
I see do as I say not as I do

MARION
Yes

They hear HORSES HOOVES Abner rides in from the opposite
side of the village from the church not having seen the
results of the massacre Excited he dismounts

ABNER
THEYRE HERE CONTINENTALS THEYRE
HERE

Marion and Gabriel just look at him Abner is confused by
their reaction Then he sees the remains of the church
and the laid out charred bodies

EXT PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Mixed gatherings of Marions militia and Continentals are
clustered around the campfires with more Continentals
arriving all the time

Some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with
tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired
talking quietly

A couple of Patriots play a MELANCHOLY TUNE ON FIFE AND
VIOLIN

Marions tent is set up but hes nowhere to be seen
Gabriel walks to Marions gear Finding Marions weapons
belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the
paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS LEAD
SOLDIERS As Gabriel takes one Marion steps up behind
him

MARION
If this war is about more than
Thomas its about more than Anne
as well Stay the course

GABRIEL
As you did at Fort Wilderness

Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO
THEM He dismounts excited voluble He strides over
pleased to see Marion oblivious to his and Gabriels
mood

LEE
Look at you I knew you could do
it
Lee laughs picks up a bottle and takes a big pull

LEE
We have a chance Better than a
chance Cornwallis is running to

the Chesapeake probably to meet his
fleet at Yorktown I wish I could
see his face when he sees a dozen
French ships floating there And
Washington should be a day or two
behind him

(beat)
And on top of everything I have a
son Born last month in Alexandria

Gabriel rises and walks away Lee finally tunes into the
pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel
He turns to Marion

MARION
His wife was killed yesterday She
was with child

LEE
Im sorry I didnt know

Marion nods They stand in silence Lee hands Marion the
bottle He takes a drink

to Marion

AT ONE OF THE CAMPSITES

Marion and Dalton and several of the other men look down
at some empty bedrolls

Cradling him

Gabriel is stunned confused by the wounds

the blood in to no avail

the PUFFS OF SMOKE OF INTERMITTENT CANNON FIRE

WASHINGTON AND MARION

Finish the walnuts They stop for a moment to catch their
breath

WASHINGTON
I was sorry to hear about your son

MARION
I lost another a year ago Thomas
He was only fifteen

WASHINGTON
Ive had no sons to lose nor
daughters
(beat)

I lose the sons of other men
They look out at the vista knowing that theyre looking
at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men

WASHINGTON
Life was easier when we only had
ourselves to get killed

They walk on joining the others on the crest of the hill
The officers are looking out some with spyglasses at
the British emplacements

WASHINGTON
Gentlemen what do we see

HAMILTON
Mortars center with two lines of
enfilading trenches

PINKNEY
More along the right flank and
behind the forward redoubts

LAFAYETTE
A formidable defensive position

Very formidable

HAMILTON
They could hold out for weeks

Washington nods and turns to Marion

WASHINGTON
Francis tell me about General
Cornwallis

MARION

Remember Braddock

WASHINGTON
That bad

MARION
Worse

WASHINGTON

Proud priggish and competent A
very bad combination in an
adversary

Washington sighs

WASHINGTON
For those of you who dont know we
intercepted a British dispatch this
morning General Clinton has sailed
from New York to relieve Cornwallis
That hits Washingtons officers hard

HAMILTON
How long before they arrive

WASHINGTON
Less than a week Sixteen ships and
over nine thousand Redcoats

LAFAYETTE
Sooner or later that message will
get through to Cornwallis

PINKNEY
And when it does hell just wait us
out

WASHINGTON

And when the British ships arrive
the French ships will flee And
when the French ships flee General
Rochambeau and the French troops
will flee as well

Marion speaks up

MARION
Then you must let the message go
through

They all turn to Marion most of them looking at him as if
hes insane

WASHINGTON
If Cornwallis receives news that
Clinton is coming hell simply hold
tight and wait Hell fight a
purely defensive battle and hell
win that

MARION

No he wont There are two things
you need to know about Cornwallis
First he is a very proud man He
would rather risk defeat than share
a victory

(beat)
If you give him what he thinks is an
out hell take it

WASHINGTON
And what is the second thing

Marion pulls Cornwallis journal out of his haversack and
leafs through it

MARION
Ill let him tell you himself
(reading)
Vl but it is this colonial militia
that is the most irksome Not
worthy of my attention but
demanding it not worthy of British
blood but taking it and not worthy
of a soldiers honor but sullying
it Those nights of mine that are
not sleepless are filled with
dreams of a cavalry charge on the
heels of fleeing farmers

Marion closes the journal

MARION
He has no respect for citizen
soldiers Thats your bait
militia

Washington nods considering it
EXT CORNWALLIS HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENING

Under fire Cornwallis and his staff Major Halbert
strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch

MAJOR HALBERT
Sir a dispatch from General Clinton
made it through the rebel lines

Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it It staggers
him He sits down

WILKINS
Sir

Cornwallis fumes His jaw sets with anger He slowly
crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury

CORNWALLIS
Call a general staff meeting

AIDE
Yes sir

EXT YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN

Marion stands at the American battlements looking out at
the British defensive works Above him stars are
visible but theyre fading in the light of the pre-dawn
glow from the horizon

Marion scans the disappearing stars searching out the
NORTH STAR but in the increasingly harsh light of this
day he cant find it He turns his eyes back to the
battlefield
EXT YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility
to a few dozen yards Men move like ghosts

THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist
There is no overview just separate detachments

An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY mounted
waiting steadying their horses

Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES

An American Command including Washington LaFayette and
two dozen staff officers attended by riders and
runners

And finally MARION AND HIS MEN who stand in the middle
of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long
valley-line depression

They stand silently unable to see anything other than
each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass
in front of them

Theyre all grim They know whats coming

Then the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM heard but unseen coming
from over the slope

Then MORE DRUMS more and more A COMPETITION OF DRUM
BEATS

Marions men listen turning their heads trying to
imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in
front of them

MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS Dalton Scott Rev
Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from
other units They quickly gather around

MARION
The British army believes in
officers I believe in soldiers
After we engage there will be no
more orders Every man here must
know what Im about to tell you

They listen closely

MARION
We are the bait in a trap Were
militia Cornwallis thinks were

rabble nothing more than a bunch of
undisciplined farmers And if he
thinks thats what we are thats
what were going to give him
Listen up

They gather around closer

EXT BRITISH LINES - DAY

Cornwallis surrounded by his staff officers including
Tarleton stands on a low hill trying with the aid of a
spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the

morning mist begins to burn off

Through the fog he just makes out the American lines He
turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass

CORNWALLIS
Do you see that Colonel

TARLETON
Unless Im dreaming I think I see
irregulars at their center
Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look
EXT LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING

Marion and his men wait

A STRANGE SOUND Soft muted The men turn their heads
listening their eyes shifting

They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS
advancing

THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they
listen to an unseen army approaching

ON MARIONS FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see
FLASH CUTS of what he knows hes hearing

The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS

Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles
SILENCE at a stop

MORE DRUMS

The men around Marion wait

THEN THEY SEE IT

A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of
them

Thousands of Redcoats in perfect formation marching in
lockstep straight for them
Marion sees the fear on his mens faces but none of them
move

The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER its almost
enough to drive a man to flight almost

The CAMERA explores the faces of Marions men faces that
we know Rev Oliver Scott Abner Marion All are
frightened but all are motionless

Closer and closer the British line approaches

The Americans dont move

Then the BRITISH LINE STOPS

At a flurry of commands the Redcoats ready their muskets
then aim

Still Marion and the Americans dont move
DEAD SILENCE

Then a single thin voice calls out from the British
lines

IN A THUNDEROUS MASSIVE VOLLEY three thousand Britis
muskets fire simultaneously just as the entire line of
AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND

Many Americans are saved by the move but many many others
are torn apart by the British musketballs

THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE it obscures
everything Each musket spits out a billow of think white
smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of
them just fired The massive opaque white cloud quickly
spreads over the entire battlefield

The astonished Redcoats instantly reload

And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and
FLEE

Some Redcoats laugh

ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD CORNWALLIS watches
through his spyglass trying to get a sense of whats
happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke
obscures everything

He barks to his SIGNALMAN
CORNWALLIS

Fix bayonets dispatch the Green
Dragoons
The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the
message

MARION AND HIS MEN are caught in the middle of the chaotic
retreat

THE BRITISH LINE advances at a quickstep bayonets
fixed

From behind them THE GREEN DRAGOONS appear at a full
gallop Tarleton at their head

THE BATTLEFIELD

Its an astonishing sight total madness hell a
painting by Hieronymous Bosch

The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing
Patriot militiamen

The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs
TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of
the Redcoats closing in on the fleeing Patriots The
cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter

THEN SUDDENLY

Stepping into view from behind a low grass covered rise
a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS rock solid

It open up allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through
it like water

then it closes again becoming a solid blue wall

MARION HIS MEN AND THE ENTIRE MASS OF FLEEING MILITIA
STOPS DEAD turns and joins the blue American line

A flurry of orders then the BLUE WALL ERUPTS WITH A
VOLLEY of musket fire that stops the disorderly British
advance in its tracks

Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly

Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with
them

The effect of the volley is devastating
The American timing is perfect

Again the amount of SMOKE is astonishing visibility
drops to less than twenty feet in most places

Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and
there but it is primarily a battle of sound
Men simply follow the men in front of them

The Blue Continentals advance in an orderly manner from
both flanks onto the Redcoats trapping them

The Redcoats try to flee

Fighting small gathered holding actions

MARION FIRES one of his pistols

Draws his sword

Slashes downward killing one Redcoat after another
No remorse no hesitation no pity

A relentless simple battle

Slashing through the Redcoat infantry

His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British
musket and is pulled from his hands

Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol

THEN THROUGH THE SMOKE MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
TARLETON

Marion freezes his eyes locked on Tarleton who is
fighting a pitched battle making his way toward the
perimeter of the field trying to escape back to the
British lines

Seeing nothing but Tarleton Marion hurriedly tears open
his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made
from Thomas lead soldiers

As he loads the pistol his eyes still trained on
Tarleton Dalton runs up in the chaos

DALTON
COLONEL OUR LINE

Marion finishes reloading distracted he turns to Dalton
for an instant

DALTON
OUR LINE IS FALTERING

Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line
seeing

Scott Rev Oliver Abner and a dozen more of his men in
the middle of a confused battle with a larger mass of
Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental
line

MARION IS TORN

He looks to Tarleton seeing him distracted vulnerable
but too distant a target for the pistol

Then Marion looks to Rev Oliver and the others Dalton
cant wait he runs off

Marion wavers

Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to
help the faltering Patriots

TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees
Marion himself his back exposed

AT THE PATRIOT LINE

Marion Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen
arrive at the same time beating back the Redcoats

As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line FIRING AT
THE FALTERING REDCOATS

TARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him

Marion is oblivious concentrating on holding the American
line

Tarleton mounts a terrified riderless horses draws his
sword and gallops back toward the British lines on a path
that takes him directly past Marion

Tarleton gets closer raises his sword slashes

Marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of
his eye

Diverts the blow knocking Tarleton from the mount

Tarleton hits the ground Marion draws his pistol about
to fire at Tarleton

Tarleton KICKS OUT knocking the pistol from Marions
hand

Tarleton GRABS HIS SWORD SLASHES AT MARION who dodges the
blow

Tarleton advances Marion scrambles back then rises

Marion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATED
BLOWS from Tarletons SWORD
Then Marion sees his pistol loaded with a bullet from
Thomas lead soldiers lying on the ground

Marion makes his way toward the weapon still BLOCKING
BLOWS from Tarletons sword

Marion focuses on the pistol leaving himself exposed

Tarleton sees the OPENING MOVES ON MARION TARLETON
RAISES HIS SWORD about to deliver the killing blow

Marion dives GRABS HIS PISTOL FIRES KILLING
TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST

Marion stunned exhausted and surprised to be alive
watches Tarleton fall

Marion stands over Tarletons body and gives himself a
moment of bitter triumph then he turns back to the battle
at hand

Marion picks up Tarletons sword and runs to the AMERICAN
LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev Oliver are joined
by Marion and a dozen other Patriots

The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line
Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body
along with the place and the moment of his death has
disappeared into the smoke of the battle

Marion and his men fight on then Redcoats start
fleeing the field

First one Redcoat at a time then more and more
EXT YORKTOWN - DAWN

The next day Silence The battlefield as far as the
eye can see is covered with the debris of war dead men
and scattered weapons

The British have retreated back behind their defenses but
have left many of their men on the field

The Patriots regulars and militia wait behind their
barricades

Then a single figure appears on one of the British
parapets A DRUMMER BOY no more than ten-years-old
Behind him a single British officer

They boy begins to beat the drum The officer raises a
white flag

In the American lines the men see the flag Some call
out some cheer some laugh most among them MARION
simply take a deep breath Its finally over
EXT YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY

A massive ceremony carefully orchestrated laid out on
the cleaned up battlefield

Thousands of men everyone in his place as if well-
directed actors in a grand theatrical performance

The French and American armies fifteen thousand men
between them stand in perfect formation on either side of
the field forming an avenue for the British army which
marches out of its fortification

At the head of the avenue WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand
waiting

A musical band of Continentals thirty men strong loudly
plays a tune The World Turned Upside Down a jaunty
British air with a melancholy undercurrent

CORNWALLIS marches with his officers eyes straight ahead
covering his agony as best he can

As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the
South Carolina militia

MARION standing with Dalton Rev Oliver Abner Scott
and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass

CORNWALLIS glances over noting what unit they are by a
tattered battle standard that flies over them Its only
a glance and he DOESNT PICK OUT MARION who is just one
man among the many

AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE

Cornwallis reaches Washington They exchange unheard
formal greetings

Cornwallis DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HANDS IT TO WASHINGTON

FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN American and French RAISE THEIR
VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME

With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony
between Washington and Cornwallis MARION quietly and
unnoticed slips out the back of the formation and walks
away

EXT YORKTOWN - DAY

The surrender ceremony continues Marion on the fringe
of the field finishes saddling his horses and prepares to
leave LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him They
lock eyes for a moment then Marion mounts up
