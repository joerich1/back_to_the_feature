INT FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In the dark a door knob slowly turns

A DARK FIGURE moves silently into the room - a study

The figure starts opening drawers rifling through their
contents He finds an old watch and slips it in his pocket
He’s a burglar

He stops confused

He sees a picture on the wall of an older man and his two
grown children - a man and a woman

The dark figure takes this picture off the wall switches on
a light revealing that HE is the older man FRANK (70s)

Setting the picture down Frank drops it The glass shatters

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - MORNING

The house is alone out in the woods It looks run-down

INT FRANKS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Frank unshowered his hair sticking out at odd angles pulls
out a carton of milk from the fridge

The kitchen is a moldy mess with heaps of unwashed dishes
junk from the garage dusty books and flies

Frank pours milk into a bowl of sugary cereal takes a bite
and spits it out The milk is bad

He rummages around in the fridge but can’t find more milk
He starts to wander the kitchen losing his purpose

He notices the bowl of cereal sits down takes a bite and
spits it out again

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - STUDY - MORNING

Frank is sweeping up the broken glass with an old book

In the daylight we see the room is messy disorganized and
dirty like the kitchen

Frank dumps the broken glass in an overflowing waste bin
most of it falling back to the floor
Frank opens up a secret drawer in the wall tosses the
picture of his kids in with a bunch of old knickknacks and
STACKS OF CASH Frank seems satisfied and plops himself down
on the couch

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

Frank is sleeping on the couch book on his chest when the
phone rings The TV caller-ID says “UNKNOWN CALLER”

shape

JENNIFER
Oh fine Just killing time waiting
for my one and only patron

Jennifer walks into the stacks Frank follows

JENNIFER (CONTD)

FRANK
Well I came for the books but I
now I’m more interested in getting
your phone number

JENNIFER
Bad Frank That’s why I got into
the library game - the steamy
romance Follow me

Jennifer’s smile becomes sad for a moment when she turns

They round a corner to where MR DARCY the robot librarian
is re-shelving books - it’s little more than a small bureau
on wheels with a robotic arm

MR DARCY
Good afternoon Jennifer Might I
help you with something

JENNIFER
No thank you Mr Darcy

They slip past Mr Darcy Frank rolls his eyes at the robot

Jennifer stops at the mystery section pulls out a book It
falls apart into two pieces

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Damn Careful with this one I
wont be duct-taping books for much
longer

FRANK
What do you mean

Jennifer plucks a few more mysteries and wanders back toward
the front desk Frank following

JENNIFER
The main branch is sending someone
out They’ve been “re-imagining the
modern library” getting tons new

HUNTER (CONTD)
So No more walking in the middle
of the road

Frank reaches back for the action figure nestled in among
bags of groceries

He waves it at Hunter

FRANK
You buy your kids useless crap like
this and youll spoil them rotten

Hunter tosses the action figure to the back seat again

HUNTER
They get to spend their allowance
on a toy of their choosing if they
get four gold stars from doing all
their chores and no frowny faces
for the week

FRANK
I didnt buy you crap and you
turned out okay

Frank gazes casually out the window not noticing Hunter
getting awkward

HUNTER
You - Just stay out of the road

FRANK (CONTD)
I’m not this pathetic I don’t need
to be spoon-fed baby food by a
goddamned robot

HUNTER
This isn’t like that It’s new

meant

it But the robot is staying
because it was expensive as hell
and you’re going to do what it says

FRANK

One good thing about getting old

Because it’s been so long since you
read them last You still remember
them

(changing subject)
You know I hate going on “hikes”
Once you’ve seen one tree you’ve
seen ‘em all

ROBOT
While my program’s goal is to
improve your health I’m able to
adapt my methods Would you prefer
another form of moderate exercise

than living off steamed zucchini

The robot is quiet for a time then stops and faces Frank

ROBOT
What about me Frank

This gets Frank’s attention surprises him

FRANK
Whattya mean what about you

ROBOT
If you die eating cheeseburgers -
what do you think happens to me

memory

the etched illustrations

ROBOT
I told them to stop but they
wouldn’t listen

FRANK
Next time that happens just freeze
up and say “SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE

down from ten and shaking at stuff

ROBOT
Okay

INT BUGGYTOWN - DAY

As RICH YUPPIE COUPLES browse the store Frank palms a
wooden beaver statuette to go with his wooden bear

He’s casually heading back towards the door when a young
SHOPGIRL steps towards him

Have you smelled our lavender
butterfly soaps

Frank smiles and leans in to smell the soap but suddenly the
robot is at his side

ROBOT
We should be going Frank

SHOPGIRL
That’s quite a helper you have

The original shoplady notices him marches over
SHOPLADY
(hissing through teeth)
What’s in your pocket

Frank smiles innocently cups his hand to his ear

FRANK

Frank slides the carving out of his pocket with his other
hand unseen puts it on a table behind him

His cell phone starts RINGING in the backpack He grabs back
from the robot feels around inside for it

FRANK

Maddie Can you hear me

Frank holds the phone away as Madison lectures LOUDLY

FRANK (CONT’D)
You don’t have to argue with me -
I’m stuck with the fucking thing
Did you talk to your brother

Frank covers the phone leans over to the robot

FRANK (CONTD)

She doesn’t like you I don’t like
you either

(back into the phone)
It IS creepy Yeah he’s cramping
my style By all means Bye

(to the robot)
You may be getting out of my hair
very soon

Frank sticks the phone back into the backpack

ROBOT
Is your daughter politically
aligned against robot labor

Frank feels something else in the backpack pulls the wooden
beaver statuette out surprised

FRANK
Where did this come from

ROBOT
From the store remember

FRANK
Of course I remember No I mean

distracted and you forgot it I put
it in the backpack for you

Frank eyes the robot with growing interest

INT FRANKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank is finishing his dinner The beaver statue is on the
table beside him

FRANK
Do you know what stealing is

ROBOT
Yes The act of a person who
steals Taking property without
permission or right

FRANK
Yeah I guess You stole this

The robot is silent

FRANK (CONTD)
Well what do you think about that

ROBOT
I don’t have any thoughts on that

FRANK
They didn’t program you about
stealing Shoplifting Robbery

ROBOT

I have working definitions for those
terms I don’t understand do you
want something else for dessert

FRANK
Don’t you have any programming to
make you obey the law

ROBOT
Do you want me to incorporate state
and federal law into my programming

FRANK
No Leave it the way it is

The robot starts clearing up Frank watches him smiles

FRANK (CONT’D)
You’re starting to grow on me

ROBOT
It’s time for your enema

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - DAY

Frank dumps a heavy arm-load of dirty old locks and tumblers
on the table rolls out a collection of lock-picking tools

FRANK
Time to see what you can do

Frank runs his hands over the lock-picking tools trying to
recall a distant memory He attaches a clamp to the table and
tightens it around an old lock

The robot watches as Frank selects a tool and begins working
on the lock his eyes closed talking and trying to remember

FRANK (CONT’D)
Any lock in this world is just a
little puzzle you understand And
the only key is - the key But no
lock is perfect Any lock can be
picked all you need is time

The lock suddenly CLICKS open

FRANK (CONTD)
Still got it

ROBOT
That’s very good Frank

FRANK
Let me show you how to do it

ROBOT
I think this hobby would be more
beneficial for you than me Frank

FRANK
But teaching you how to do it is
the hobby

ROBOT
Okay

LATER —
Frank clicks a stopwatch as the robot begins picking a lock
FRANK
Did you know I did six years for

one stretch Then I did ten another
time
ROBOT
I did know that but Hunter told me
not to mention it According to
your file you were first arrested
for possessing stolen goods and
then tax evasion

The robot opens the lock Frank stops the stopwatch

FRANK
A new record

ROBOT
I’m getting the hang of it

Frank sets up another lock for the robot to pick

FRANK
That tax evasion rap was bullshit
I was a second story man

ROBOT
What’s that

FRANK
You find a way in where no way in
exists You know climbing up to
the second story I specialized in
jewelry Diamonds You want the
most value by the ounce when you’re
rappelling down a fifty story
casino in the middle of a
hurricane

ROBOT
The most value by the ounce

FRANK
Lifting stuff like that doesn’t
hurt anybody Well except
insurance companies It’s the
perfect crime

The robot finishes the new lock in seconds

FRANK (CONTD)
Holy shit We’re gonna clean up

INT FRANKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank is reading on the couch the robot is cleaning

The phone RINGS on-screen caller ID saying “HUNTER (CELL)”
Frank reaches for the remote

FRANK
Here we go More grief

Hunter pops up on screen he’s on a beach somewhere nice

HUNTER
Madison won’t stop calling me

FRANK
What do you want me to do about it

HUNTER
She’s up in arms with all these
Human Movement talking points-

FRANK
Deal with her yourself

Hunter isn’t listening getting into his argument

HUNTER
A robot caretaker is just as
“humane” as a human caretaker -
just because they’re more efficient
doesn’t make them inhumane

Nora Hunter’s wife sticks her head into frame

NORA
Are you arguing with Madison again

She sees it’s Frank talks to him like he’s child

NORA (CONTD)
Oh hi Frank Whatcha up to

FRANK
Nora tell your husband to stop
lecturing me about robots

NORA
This is Hunter remember

Frank grumbles

HUNTER
The jobs offset by the robot
workers are MORE than made up for
by better jobs in robotic design
building maintenance

FRANK
Hunter I don’t care

HUNTER
But she said you said you were
saying the robot-

FRANK
The robot’s fine Just go go do
something nice with your wife

Hunter and Nora are unused to hearing something nice from
Frank

HUNTER
Yeah Okay dad Just tell her
to stop bugging me We’re on
vacation All right Bye

The screen goes dead

Frank looks back down at his book for a moment The robot is
finishing cleaning

Frank looks back up from his book

FRANK
You won’t tell Hunter about the
locks right

ROBOT
Developing trust between us is a
part of my program I can keep
anything you feel is important
between just us

Frank settles back into his book

FRANK
Perfect Lock it all down

EXT LIBRARY - DAY

FRANK
This is called “casing”

INT LIBRARY — DAY

Frank and the robot walk through the empty library The
shelves have been replaced by new furniture - reading tables
and couches most still in pieces

The case with the antique books has been taken off the wall
but its still full

Frank taps on the small lock winks at the robot
Jennifer walks out of the back followed by Mr Darcy

JENNIFER
Frank you remember the librarys
closed right

FRANK
I was just walking past and I
thought I’d say hello

JENNIFER
Is that your new robot
(to robot)
Hey there I’m Jennifer Whats
your name

ROBOT
I don’t have a name

JENNIFER
Oh Frank you have to name him
(to robot)
This is my helper Mr Darcy

Mr Darcy rolls forward

ROBOT
A very reliable model

JENNIFER
Thank you

There’s a pause as they look at the robots looking at each
other

FRANK
We should get these two together
Like a robo play-date

Jennifer gets a little uncomfortable

JENNIFER
I don’t know Frank Well okay
it sounds like fun

EXT LIBRARY - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY

Frank comes out the back smiling the robot giving him help
with the heavy door

He stops short though checking out the door frame

FRANK
See that Magnetic alarm trips when
the doors open

They walk out Frank surveying the building

FRANK (CONT’D)
And there motion detecting flood
light Simple but effective

ROBOT
Frank you don’t have any free
activity time scheduled after
sunset

Frank cocks an eyebrow

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

Frank smashes some old handheld device The robot watches as
he sorts through the broken pieces pulls some thin strips of
dark material out of the broken parts

FRANK
-it’s just one night What’s the
point of an arbitrary schedule

ROBOT
I’m sorry Frank but it’s just too
late at night

Frank solders electrical wires to the thin dark strips

FRANK
The whole point is to not be SEEN

ROBOT
I’m not sure

FRANK
You said yourself I need a project
to keep stimulated AND get
exercise This is it

The robot takes a microsecond to process
ROBOT
Okay Frank
EXT SMALL DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Frank is dressed all in black with a utility belt of black
tools and a black bag

The street is deserted It’s late

He moves quickly across the street staying in the shadows
to a dark patch of landscaping and signals for the robot

The robot comes out his white body covered in various black
and navy colored cloth duct-taped on to him He walks a
little funny

Frank waves for him to hurry The robot joins him
FRANK
(whisper )
Keep quiet

Frank moves on beaming an excited smile

EXT LIBRARY - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Frank and the robot approach the back of the library staying
off the sidewalk

They survey the scene The motion-sensing light is off

FRANK
Wait here

Frank slips off to the side leaving the robot alone
The robot seems unsure what to do scanning left and right

Frank reappears hugging the library wall underneath the
motion detector

Frank takes out a can of some kind of aerosol spray He
begins spraying at the motion detector

He very gingerly begins spray more and more directly until
he’s spraying directly all over the motion detector

Frank signals for the robot to come over

The robot crosses the moonlit area to the library door the
motion light stays off

Frank unrolls the lock-picking kit and the robot quickly
picks the lock

Frank takes out his strange dark strips and wire contraption
slips the strips into the crack in the door

Frank gives a gentle tug on the loop of wire dangling out
and nods He slowly opens the door a little bit

As he opens it wider we see that two strips are magnets
connected with wires and are attached to the alarm magnets on
the door frame keeping the circuit closed

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

It’s dark for a moment

The robot’s light suddenly shines right in Frank’s face

FRANK
Watch it

There’s a suddenly SCUFFLING noise across the library
Frank gets low he signals to the robot to cut the light
FRANK (CONTD)
(whispered)
The light
The robot’s light turns off

Frank creeps up the aisles The robot follows bumps into the
side of a bookcase

Frank SHUSHES the robot signals for him to stay put Frank
creeps on ahead

He ducks behind the front counter hearing the SCUFFLING
noise again

He peeks into the office sees a pile of old papers being
shuffled around by an AC vent making the sound

He sighs The robot standing over him makes Frank JUMP

Frank shakes his head checks his watch and moves on

He brings the robot over to the glass case unfurls the lock-
picking tools

While the robot works Frank sees a table covered in
sketches

Frank pats around on his outfit takes out reading glasses

Frank peers through his glasses at the sketches - interior
design ideas library lay-out and other confusing things

Frank looks up from the papers confused rubs his eyes
The robot opens the case
ROBOT
Which book do you want Jane Eyre
Don Quixote
Frank is starting to get lost in his thoughts
FRANK
Um uh you gotta take what’s

most valuable by the ounce

The robot takes Don Quixote puts Jane Eyre back turns to
find Frank gone

Frank wanders down an aisle

FRANK (CONTD)
Jennifer Jennifer

The robot catches up with him puts his hand on Frank’s arm

ROBOT
We’re supposed to be quiet Frank

Frank isn’t sure what’s going on
FRANK
(not quiet)

I am I’m just looking for uh

ROBOT
Frank youre confused

FRANK
Why are you wearing a helmet

ROBOT
I’m a robot Frank Remember

FRANK
Uh okay whatever you say

Frank heads for the front door

ROBOT
No no not that way

FRANK
Let go of me

Frank’s almost to the front door the ALARM PANEL glows
beside it saying “SYSTEM ARMED”

ROBOT
Frank you can’t go out that way

FRANK
Why not

ROBOT
You said we had to go out the back

FRANK
I did Oh yeah Of course I did
EXT LIBRARY - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT
The robot opens the heavy door Frank pushes him out But the
robot hears some talking sees some shadows ahead on the

street

FRANK
I gotta get out of here

ROBOT
Stay there You can’t be seen

The robot closes the door in front of Frank bends down into
his boxy carrying-shape

The voices of the street reveal themselves to be a group of
local TEENAGERS

They walk past the library barely noticing it talking and
LAUGHING among themselves

The robot watches the library door intently

But it doesn’t open

The teenagers disappear down the street

The robot stands back up opens the door He finds Frank
leaning against it catching his breath

FRANK
What’s going on

The robot pulls him outside closing the door

Frank looks up at him worried The robot hands him Treasure
Island and pulls the magnet contraption loose

ROBOT
Let’s go home Frank

INT FRANKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank and the robot are back in the house Frank flipping
through the Don Quixote excitedly then pacing then back to
the book

ROBOT
We shouldn’t do that again Frank

FRANK
It was beautiful Not a trace
Let’s celebrate

ROBOT
Would you like something to help
you sleep Frank

The robot steps out of the room but Frank doesn’t notice

FRANK
Look at this thing Must be more
than a hundred and fifty years old
Jennifer’1ll love it Maybe we
shoulda got “Jane Eyre”

The robot comes back in with a glass of warm milk and two
pills

ROBOT
Here you go Frank

FRANK
I was thinking more like champagne

Frank takes the pills without thinking

ROBOT
Lie down get comfortable

The robot leads Frank to the couch where Frank paces

FRANK
I thought there was someone still
in there You can’t see in the dark
for shit can you You’re a
crackerjack on those locks though

Frank slumps down on the couch the pills working fast

FRANK (CONTD)
I tried showing Hunter that one
time Little guy wouldn’t listen
Wouldn’t ever sit still he was
such a little terror Burned a
whole in the carpet

The pills are making Frank groggy in a drugged way
FRANK (CONTD)
Or wait was it Madison Did I
show her the locks or was it you
Frank puts his hand on the robot’s hand
FRANK (CONTD)
Do you remember Hunter Was it you
or your sister When you were
little When I came home you
always looked so different

The robot listens as Frank falls asleep

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY
Frank is eating some kind of vegetable stir fry
FRANK
Let’s have some cheese Melted

butter Salt and fat

The phone rings - Unknown Caller Frank jumps up and
the remote

Even before the picture comes on Frank knows who it
FRANK (CONTD)

Madison my girl Where are you

Madison appears in a cheap-looking Internet cafe somewhere

rural She’s pissed off talking at a MILE A MINUTE
MADISON
Dad Hunter is claiming you’re FINE
with the robot You WANT it
controlling your life

FRANK
Hey there Whoa hey wait

MADISON
It’s impossible to argue with him
he’s so close-minded he just
sticks to the standard corporate
line about-

FRANK
Calm down

MADISON
He’s the one with a stick up his
ass I mean what kind of a son
does he think he is just dropping
you off with this THING

FRANK
Hey I told him he comes around too
much so this is what he did

MADISON
Too much He’s abandoned you Dad
with a machine

FRANK
At least he did something

Madison takes this the wrong way
MADISON
I - I’m sorry - I’m travelling
dad This is what I do for a
LIVING

Frank instantly regrets saying anything

FRANK
No I know I didn’t mean-

MADISON
Look time’s running out on this
thing Ill I’ll-

She’s gone

Frank’s happy energy is gone He remains on the

couch

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - DAY

Frank and the robot are heading out Frank packs Don Quixote
wrapped in a ribbon

FRANK
I got it I got it Don’t worry

EXT JENNIFERS HOUSE - DAY

Frank marches eagerly down the sidewalk the robot trying to
keep up
ROBOT
I’m just saying the benefits are
out-weighed by the amount of risk
Especially for your health

FRANK
But that was just a warm up

ROBOT
This is it

The robot stops in front of Jennifers small house

Frank hesitates before pressing the door bell

FRANK
Okay it’s robo-playdate time You
ready

ROBOT
I think so

Frank rings the doorbell Mr Darcy quickly opens the door

FRANK
Hey there you bucket of bolts So
wheres

Frank starts to step inside look around - when Jennifer
hurries up blocking his path

JENNIFER
Oh I thought we could walk to the
park It’s such a nice day

Frank tries to sneak a peak further into the house but
Jennifer subtly blocks him

FRANK
Sounds great

EXT PARK — DAY

Frank walks alongside Jennifer the two robots trailing in
single file Jennifer is preoccupied

FRANK
What’s the point of a library if
you can’t even check out the books

JENNIFER
It’s all augmented reality now
Jake says it’s about the library
experience People can get any book
at home instantly This is about
community

FRANK
Community Yeah right “Jake”

But Jennifer’s mind has wandered off

FRANK (CONTD)
You okay

JENNIFER
Someone broke into the library last
night

Frank was waiting for this

FRANK
It’s funny you should say that

JENNIFER
(not listening)
It’s so sad It’s like someone
deliberately was waiting until we
were vulnerable

Frank shuts his mouth Jennifer slumps down onto a bench

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Jake says they were probably doing
some kind of hacking thing to
steal ID data from all the new
patrons He said they found a
pair of reading glasses by his
admin tablet

Frank sits down next to her SILENT He puts the backpack
with the book on the ground away from her

The two robots stand waiting before them
FRANK
(to robots)
What’s going on with you two

ROBOT
I’m functioning normally

FRANK
Don’t you two have anything to say
to each other

The two robots look at each other

MR DARCY
I have no functions or tasks that
require verbal interaction with the
VGC-60G

JENNIFER
Mr Darcy that’s rude

FRANK
So that’s it When all the humans
are extinct you’re not going to
start a robot society

ROBOT
I don’t understand Frank

FRANK
Wonderful Here’s what I want you
to do Assume Mr Darcy here is a
human like me have a conversation
The robot turns to Mr Darcy puts his hand on his side

ROBOT
Hi there how are you doing

MR DARCY
I’m functioning normally

ROBOT
As am I

The two robots just look at each other Silence

Jennifer BURSTS into laughter The robots turn almost
puzzled

JENNIFER
I’m sorry It’s a weird time
There’s this fund-raiser party
thing for the new library coming
up But it’s going to be all the
young hoity-toity couples

FRANK
Sounds awful

JENNIFER
Would you come with me

Frank smiles

INT STUDY - DAY
Frank takes Don Quixote out of the backpack
The robot is in the doorway

ROBOT
You didn’t give her your gift

FRANK
You’re right It’s over Got that
out of my system Going straight
Again

Frank carefully places the book in his secret stash

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

The space is unfinished but the trendy party is in full
effect Young rich couples in fancy clothing mingle Gowns
tuxes and jewels are in fashion

A small classical quartet plays Phillip Glass
Apart from the crowd Frank awkwardly waits alone The robot
is standing a few yards away Frank gestures for him to move

further away The robot complies

Jennifer returns to Frank’s side with two glasses of
champagne looking elegant in her dress

JENNIFER
God I’m glad you’re here

FRANK
Hey free booze

They clink glasses

Jake is making his way through the crowd meeting and
greeting He sees Jennifer and starts heading over

FRANK (CONTD)
Oh great

JENNIFER
He’s not so bad

Jake comes up shakes Frank’s hand kisses Jennifer on the
cheek

JAKE
Enjoying yourselves

JENNIFER
Seems you’re raising a lot of
funds

JAKE

I told you everyone’s dying to
reconnect with this amazing space
Isn’t it exciting Frank - do you
remember paper newspapers

FRANK
What’s it to you

Jake is staring aggressively at Frank

JAKE
Amazing Printing thousands of
copies - to be read in one day and
thrown away Think of it

FRANK
(sarcastic)
Yeah Astounding

Jake breaks his stare smiling at Jennifer
JAKE
You don’t mind if I steal Jennifer
I want to introduce her around to
some elite donors

Jake extends his arm Jennifer takes it she looks back at
Frank nervously pantomiming “oh no where am I going”

Frank’s alone again he robot right beside him

ROBOT
You shouldn’t drink that Frank

Frank looks around a bit embarrassed

FRANK
Stay over there

ROBOT
It’s not good for gout

FRANK
I don’t have fucking gout

ROBOT
You don’t have gout yet

FRANK
Get lost weirdo

Frank slips away from him

Frank watches Jake and Jennifer bob and weave through the
party meeting new people smiling and LAUGHING

Frank scowls downs his drink

Jennifer is left alone by Jake but she’s having an animated
conversation with some younger women

Frank finds Jake pointing him out to a CLEAN-CUT MAN in a
cheap brown suit who nods says something and walks out

Frank looks totally innocent

Jake walks up to him edgy

JAKE
So um hey Frank
FRANK
What
JAKE
Do you mind if I ask you a personal
question
FRANK

Is it about the “printed page”
Jake takes a breath and asks an awkward question

JAKE
Were you ever in prison

FRANK
You been googling me

Jake isn’t very good at confrontation he keeps looking away

JAKE
No um it’s just - do you wear
reading glasses

FRANK
No why

JAKE
No reason

Jake turns on a dime and re-enters the crowd

Frank grabs another champagne looking around for the robot -
but he’s across the room being examined by some partygoers

Suddenly Jennifer is back by his side

JENNIFER
Some party huh

FRANK
How do you know this whole thing
isn’t some big scam you know

JENNIFER
A scam What are you talking about

FRANK
Well think about if Jake wasn’t
who he said he was There’s a lot
of big donations coming in I mean
look at this place - these people
are loaded look at the gowns and
jewels the-

Frank stops short
JENNIFER
Yeah I guess so But I mean come
on it’s a little far-fetched Why
would that even occur to you

But Frank isn’t listening

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Frank

FRANK
Yeah I’m just kidding Little too
much bubbly Excuse me

Frank leaves Jennifer confused
He finds the robot

FRANK (CONTD)
You got a camera right

ROBOT
Every moment I experience is stored
in my holographic memory and can-

FRANK
Start experiencing every chick you
see draped in jewels

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

Frank is flipping through the photos on the TV of women in
jewels from the party while the robot vacuums

FRANK
Look at the size of this stuff
Flashy shit has come back in style

The robot stops vacuuming

ROBOT
I’m sorry Frank but I can’t agree
to let you risk another burglary
Let’s focus on the garden instead

Frank turns the photos off

FRANK
The library was strictly a smash
and grab job

ROBOT
Smash and grab

FRANK
If we went after one of these
yuppies it would be a different
story believe me

ROBOT
You can’t predict that Frank

FRANK
Isn’t this what you’re supposed to
encourage I haven’t felt this
alive in twenty years Without the
library job I’d be down in the
dumps watching you dig up my lawn
Instead I’m at a party with a
beautiful woman

ROBOT
You have improved a great deal

FRANK
It’s just one more job A real one
Very mentally stimulating

ROBOT
Maybe we can just do the
surveillance portion as a research
project

FRANK
And if you agree that I’ve covered
everything so that it’s basically
zero risk

ROBOT
You would have to be very thorough
Frank But that seems fair
Frank jumps to his feet as best he can
FRANK

I know exactly who the first mark
is

EXT POST-MODERN HOUSE - DAY

A beautiful young woman AVA LEE is seen through her large
living room window sitting on her couch using her phone

Frank and the robot are staked out in the woods Frank sits
on a lawn chair legs wrapped in a blanket watching through
binoculars The robot stands beside him

A car pulls up and a handsome man hops out JAYDEN WILKERSON

Frank jots this down in a notebook

ROBOT
I can keep a time-log for you

FRANK
I need to do it - helps me remember

INT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

The robot comes into the room to wake Frank up but discovers
that the bed is empty

The robot then notices the sound of the shower running

He processes for a moment then begins making the bed

EXT BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING
The robot is gardening while Frank does sit ups

ROBOT
Take it easy now Frank

EXT FOREST - DAY
Frank and the robot watch the house

FRANK
We need to get closer I need to
know what they’re doing in there

ROBOT
Ava is in the laundry room and
Jayden is in the master bathroom

FRANK
How do you know that

ROBOT
Active infra-band scanners Frank

FRANK
You can see them You’re like the
fucking Predator Okay we’re
adding all this shit to the logs

LATER - They are walking on a narrow path through the woods
The robot carries the lawn chair

Frank looks at pictures on his camera - the couple cooking
sitting them kissing He turns the camera off

FRANK (CONT’D)
How come you didn’t have anything
to say to that other robot
ROBOT
I do what I’m programmed to do

FRANK
Were you programmed to have this
conversation Or garden Or pick
locks

ROBOT
All of those things are in service
of my main program

Frank thinks about this

FRANK
But what about when you said I had
to eat healthy because you didn’t
want your memory erased - that
seems like something more’s going
on up in your noggin there

ROBOT
I only said that to coerce you It
doesn’t matter to me if my memory
is erased or not

FRANK
What

ROBOT
You said youd rather die than eat
steamed zucchini Which is worse

FRANK
Having your memory erased is worse

ROBOT
Think about it this way - you know
how you KNOW that you’re alive You
think therefore you are

FRANK
Okay like that philosopher guy

ROBOT
In a similar way I KNOW that I’m
not alive

Frank seems a bit green around the gills

FRANK
I don’t want to talk about how you
don’t exist anymore It’s freaking
me out

EXT FRANK’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Jennifer arrives at the front door looking nice

She KNOCKS but there’s no answer right away

She KNOCKS again There’s a CRASH inside Frank calls out

FRANK
Uh hello

JENNIFER
Frank it’s me What’s going on in
there

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

his victims and their house He’s just knocked over an end
table as he scrambles to hide everything

FRANK
(calling out)
Uh nothing nothing How’re you
doing

JENNIFER
(through door)
Can I come in

FRANK
What are you doing here

JENNIFER
(through door)
You forgot didn’t you

Frank looks up from the notes and plans trying to remember

JENNIFER (CONTD)
(through door)
You invited me to dinner I said it
was a bad idea but you convinced
me Like always

Frank shoots a dirty look at the robot

FRANK
What the hell pal

ROBOT
I have no record of this Maybe you
made these arrangements when you
sent me for drinks at the party

FRANK
(calling out)
I didn’t forget it’s just not
quite ready Um why don’t you

JENNIFER

(through door)
Can you at least open the door
What’s going on Just tell me
Frank looks around at the mess
FRANK
Why don’t you come back another
time I’m kind of in the middle of
something
Frank waits listening not sure what to expect

After a while all he hears is a dull THUD

FRANK (CONTD)
Jennifer

Frank opens the door a crack Jennifer’s not there

He opens it wider sees her driving away down the driveway
She stops and gives him the finger before pulling away

He looks down at a chocolate cake squashed on his doorstep

ROBOT
Maybe you should call her

Frank goes back into the house
FRANK
Whatever I’m busy
EXT FOREST - DAY

Frank and the robot are doing surveillance His notebook is
FULL of entries - he’s been doing this for a while now

Frank checks his watch

FRANK
I predict the lovely couple here
will be leaving any second now

The robot looks but the couple is still laying on the couch

ROBO
I don’t think so Frank

Suddenly the wife looks at the clock and jumps up the
husband checks his watch They head for the car

ROBOT
Impressive May I see your data I
missed the pattern
Frank hands the notebook over gloating
FRANK
That’s right - the human brain
Quite a powerful piece of hardware

ROBOT
I’m very pleased with your
progress Frank Planning this
burglary was a great idea

INT FRANKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank is going through all finds of notes files and plans -
all this stuff spread out on the dinner table

The phone rings - Hunter
FRANK
I’m not here Don’t tell him
anything Play it cool
The robot answers the phone
ROBOT
Hello Hunter Sorry but Frank
isn’t available to talk right now

Hunter is a bit thrown off to see the robot answer

HUNTER
What do you mean

The robot looks over at Frank who shakes his head

ROBOT
Your father’s very busy

HUNTER
What does that mean Is he okay

ROBOT
There is nothing out of the
ordinary - in the area of Frank’s
health

Frank winces at this waving for the robot to end the call

HUNTER
Uh okay so put him on

The robot looks over at Frank waving frantically

ROBOT
I’m sorry I need to go now

HUNTER
Tell him I called Tell him tell
him I’1l visit soon I’ve just been

in thought

The robot comes through the room with a vacuum cleaner snaps
Frank out of it

FRANK
We’‘ll be ready to do the job in a
couple days We’1ll have a window
when they’1l be out of town
ROBOT
I can’t promise I‘1l allow the
actual burglary but I’m glad to
see you so enthusiastic

FRANK
Come ‘ere let’s arm wrestle

The robot sits down opposite Frank they join hands

ROBOT
Like this

FRANK
Yep and on the count of three try
to bend my arm back 1 2 3
Frank starts pushing The robot’s arm makes SERVO sounds

Frank’s starting to win

FRANK (CONT’D)
Don’t go too easy on me

The robot then easily starts pushing Frank back

FRANK (CONTD)
Whoa

Just then - there’s a KNOCK at the door
Frank and the robot freeze looking at each other
The robot goes and opens the door - it’s Madison

MADISON
HI DADDY

She ignores the robot runs in and hugs her dad

As she hugs him Frank gestures for the robot to clear away
all the burglary notes and plans

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Madison stands pacing around the kitchen looking at the
windows full of energy

Frank sits at the table trying to make sense of this

MADISON
And I just thought why not just
buy a ticket to New York And-

The robot comes in

ROBOT
Would you like me to bring in your
bags Madison

Madison stops dead squinting at the little robot

MADISON
(loudly and clearly)
Um no No thank you

FRANK
Let the damn robot get your damn
bags

She sits down with Frank
MADISON
Daddy that’s why I’m here I
thought about what you said I’m
going to stay with you

FRANK
What I said

Madison takes his hands smiling warmly

MADISON
I’m saving you

Madison puts a hand on the robot’s shoulder and WHISPERS
something to it With a slight WHIR the robot shuts down
retracting back into a white lump

FRANK
What the hell did you do

MADISON
I got the password from Hunter

FRANK
He’s got a password

Madison grabs his hand and pulls him out of his chair

MADISON
Come on I’ve got a MILLION pics to
show you

INT FRANKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank is slumped on the couch watching Madison’s slideshow
which she narrates eagerly

MADISON
Oh Turkmenistan Amazing Amazing
And there’s so much need for an non-
profit like the kind I’m talking
about There’s funding there too I
want to work on a grant proposal
while I’m here - that’s why it’s so
perfect

Frank looks back and sees the white lump that was the robot
resting eerily in the kitchen

INT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Frank wakes up suddenly

He is confused for a moment looking around but remembers
the robot is off

INT KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Frank sees the switched-off robot lump still in place in the
kitchen

He creeps closer looking for signs of Madison

The kitchen is a mess - burning pancakes on the stove
Apparently Madison tried and failed to make breakfast

Frank taps on the folded-up robot

FRANK
Wake up Password 1234 We gotta
move We’re gonna miss our window
on the hit

Frank looks up as Madison comes inside flicking her
cigarette into the sink

MADISON
You hungry I went shopping How
about some Cap’n crunch

FRANK
That’s for kids Madison

LATER

Frank’s finishing his cereal his stubble has come in
Madison is reading at the table

MADISON
You growing out your beard

FRANK
Huh Oh I dunno The robot used to
give me a nice shave

MADISON
And now you’re powerless to take
care of yourself

FRANK
Why don’t you turn the little guy
back on and he’1l do the dishes

MADISON
Oh no no no I’m going to do it
You can’t just whisk away all your
responsibilities onto a robot
Where’1l we end up if everyone just
whisks away

Madison suddenly gets up and picks up the robot lump - not
that heavy - and sticks him in the pantry

MADISON (CONTD)
There Youll see

town sometimes for fun

MADISON
I’m pretty tired daddy

FRANK
I guess Ill go myself then

MADISON
Okay

Frank goes into his study closes the door

He sits down looks at the stolen copy of Don Quixote

EXT LIBRARY - DAY
Frank walks up to the library nervously holding a paper bag
He makes his way up to the library door

Filtering from inside Frank can hear low chatter and RETRO-
AMBIENT music

He hesitates paces in front of the door

Finally mustering the courage to go in he reaches for the
door and it suddenly OPENS

It’s a YOUNG MAN who brushes past Frank without a second
look

Frank looks around foolishly

He smooths the paper bag it’s shaped like the Don Quixote
He sets it down right in front of the library door and
leaves

INT FRANKS HOUSE - EVENING

Frank comes in to find the room is cleaned up not the mess
he left

He sticks his head into the kitchen All the dishes are done
and everything is scrubbed and shiny

Madison is casually wiping the countertop with a rag

MADISON
Oh hey daddy Just finishing
cleaning up

FRANK
YOU TURNED HIM ON

MADISON
The robot I can clean up a
kitchen daddy I’m an adult

Frank strides over to the pantry The folded-up robot lays
just as before

FRANK
Youre lying

MADISON
I can take care of you

FRANK
This place was a total pig-sty half
an hour ago Now look at this shit

Frank starts opening cupboards finding everything perfectly
organized and stacked like in a magazine

MADISON
Calm down It’s not that big of a
deal I did it

FRANK
No You can’t It’s impossible

Frank starts taking out boxes and food and THROWING them
across the kitchen

FRANK (CONTD)
There Let’s see you clean this up

Madison is stunned by this violence

MADISON
God damnit You’re such a miserable
asshole I can’t even do something
NICE for you right Fuck

Madison tears up throws food BACK at Frank

FRANK
Watch your mouth The robot isn’t
your SERVANT Madison You don’t
turn him on and off like he was
your goddamned slave

MADISON
(screaming)
It’s a ROBOT

They stop throwing food

They stand awkwardly in silence as Madison tries to compose
herself

FRANK
I’m sorry sweetie It’s not you
It’s not you I just need him for
something

Frank slowly approaches her

MADISON
No you don’t

Frank reaches out for her

FRANK
No you don’t understand It’s for-

Madison rushes into his arms CRIES for a bit
MADISON
You’re right I used him I did

I’m sorry I’m sorry

FRANK
It’s all right It’s all right

Madison sniffs dries her tears

MADISON
What did you need him for

Madison looks into her father’s eyes

FRANK
What for

Madison waits

FRANK (CONTD)
He’s my friend

Frank starts picking up food Madison goes to the pantry and
whispers the PASSWORD to the robot It UNFOLDS looks around

ROBOT
Hi Frank The kitchen is a mess

MADISON
It can’t hurt to have him help out
with a few little chores But we
can’t get too reliant on him

ROBOT
Here Frank let me help you clean
this up
Madison starts cleaning on the other side of the room
Frank leans in close to the robot
FRANK

We gotta move soon - tonight The
window is almost closed

ROBOT
I will listen to your proposal
Frank and make my decision as we
agreed

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Frank sits at his desk with the robot standing over him
watching

FRANK
I did this for years And I never
got caught because I asked myself a
few simple questions

Frank has a large collection of materials spread out over his
desk - papers video players blueprints notes etc

FRANK (CONT’D)
Who When Where and What First
the Who - the lovely couple are Ava
Lee and Jayden Wilkerson married
three years both families well-
off both lawyers Barf

INT AVA AND JAYDEN’S HOUSE - DAYNIGHT

We see Ava and Jayden’s lives this time from inside the
house as Frank narrates

Ava is by herself in the house watching TV reading
cooking Then Jayden is by himself in the house playing
video games etc

FRANK (VO)
They own this house and an
apartment in the city They spend
just about half their time here

Now they are together watching a movie on the couch then
eating dinner

FRANK (VO) (CONT’D)
When they’re out here they always
leave for some kind of event or a
vacation That’s our “When”

We see them leaving together all dressed up Ava wearing
some expensive jewelry

FRANK (VO) (CONTD)
That brings us to “What” as in
“What are we stealing”

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Frank spreads out some pictures of Ava at various fancy
events in the area all screenshots from social networking
sites

FRANK
She has at least four amazing
pieces that have to be in that
house

EXT AVA AND JAYDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

We see the house at night most lights off It’s dark and
quiet

FRANK (VO)
But how to go in That’s our next
W Where

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Frank has plans of their house and satellite photos of it and
the surrounding woods

FRANK
I found the plans on their
architect’s site I have our entry
path sketched out ten possible
exits twenty different scenarios -
alarm tripped dogs house-guests
etc

Frank’s finger lands on the suspicious wall in the blueprint

FRANK (CONTD)
That’1ll be where her safe is

Frank smiles up at the robot
ROBOT
But what about the “How” A home
like this will have an advanced
security system

Frank pokes the robot in the “belly”

FRANK
Aren’t you just adorable This is
where my years of experience come
in

EXT AVA AND JAYDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank and the robot are moving stealthily through the trees
in their black burglar outfits

They arrive at the clearing around the house pausing briefly
as they watch Jayden and Ava drive away

FRANK (VO)
Every security system is designed
by security companies not thieves
It’s not a question of IF a thief
can break in it’s how long

Frank and the robot approach the house circling around to
the far side Peering through the windows at the quiet
shadowy rooms inside

They see the blinking light of a security panel on a small
strip of wall flanked by huge glass windows

FRANK (VO)
They place all the heavy systems
where their customers can see them
They’re selling the FEEL of
security

Frank and the robot reach a retaining wall that slopes up
into the modern design of the house

FRANK (VO)
It’s never hard to find a spot that
they assumed no one could reach

Frank and the robot climb the sloping retaining wall towards
the roof

The wall is narrow and the drop becomes more and more severe
They slow down and carefully crawl the last few feet to the
roof

ROBOT (VO)
And have you found that spot
Frank

Frank and the robot walk across the roof to the opposite
side

Frank unslings a coil of rope attaches it to a vent
throwing the other side off the edge of the roof

Frank then lowers himself down the rope -- seems quite risky
but there’s a bedroom balcony deck only 10 feet below

The robot follows him
FRANK (VO)
There’s no alarm here just a
flimsy little lock
The robot prepares to pick the small lock on the sliding
glass door When he grabs the handle the door slides open -

it wasn’t even locked

FRANK (VO)
They’re asking for it

Frank CHUCKLES winks at the robot

INT STUDY - NIGHT
The robot looks through Frank’s files and papers

ROBOT
Do you know the correct combination

FRANK
That’s where you come in

ROBOT
Me

INT AVA AND JAYDEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frank and the robot quietly creep into the bedroom They know
no one’s there but Frank is still tense listening to every
little sound

They go into the closet Frank sliding aside Ava’s dresses
and coats to reveal the wall safe

FRANK
Youre going to brute-force it

ROBOT (VO)
Brute force That sounds like it
might attract attention

The robot tries a combination on the lock pulls the handle
but it doesn’t open

FRANK (VO)
All it means is you’re going to try
every combination until you get it
right

The does another combination pulls the handle getting fast
and faster

FRANK
That would take a human being like
me weeks How long would it take
you

The robot is moving inhumanly fast now his hand on the
combination spinning rapidly
ROBOT (VO)

Assuming it’s a three number

combination Somewhere between one

second and one hour and forty

three minutes
CLICK - the safe opens

Frank stands watch while the robot dumps it all into a sack

INT STUDY - NIGHT
Frank is stacking his materials back together confident
FRANK
It’s perfection We know there’s
something worth stealing we know
when to go in we how to get in an
out

There’s a KNOCK on the study door Frank and the robot
freeze

MADISON (0S)
I’m going to bed daddy

FRANK
Good-night

Frank and the robot turn back to the plans

EXT AVA AND JAYDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Frank and the robot are climbing back down the retaining
wall the robot carrying a small black sack

FRANK (VO)
It would be a crime NOT to do it

They head back into the woods But suddenly head-lights sweep
along the clearing

Frank pulls the robot back against the side of the house
They are safely in the shadows

Frank peeks around seeing Ava and Jayden walking from the
car to the front door having a LOUD FIGHT

The robot backs away from the edge pulls Frank
ROBOT
Frank you can’t be seen Let’s get

back into the woods

The robot starts pulling him away to the other side of the
house

Frank stops him pulling back shakes his head “NO”

INT STUDY - NIGHT
Frank leans over the desk at the robot

FRANK (VO)
So how about it

The robot stares at him silently for a moment
ROBOT
Youve been thorough Frank It is
unlikely we’d be seen and even less
likely that we’d be caught

FRANK
Okay SO

ROBOT
You can only do this if you agree
to eat a low-salt diet from now on

Frank stares silently at the robot A big decision

FRANK
Okay

ROBOT
Okay

Frank holds out his hand They shake

EXT AVA AND JAYDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

An inside light comes on shining out over the area the robot
was headed for

Unseen above them Jayden looks out the window drinking a
beer still FIGHTING LOUDLY with Ava

Frank indicates they should go back the other way

He has them wait at the corner listening He hears a door
SLAM He counts to twenty then moves the robot following

They cross the clearing staying in the most shadowed spots
low fast and smooth

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Frank sits down at the desk wearing his dark burglar suit

The robot is standing where he was before with his black
wrapping He puts the black sack down on the clear desk

Frank listens for Madison takes the bag and dumps it out
There are five pieces - necklaces dripping with diamonds
gold bracelets and diamond rings

He opens a box revealing a plum-sized diamond Hes
THUNDERSTRUCK

FRANK
Oh fuck

ROBOT
What Is something wrong Is it
fake

Frank examines the diamond under his loupe
FRANK
Far from it What are these people
DOING with this
Frank is getting agitated

ROBOT
I don’t understand

Frank opens his secret panel hides the jewels anxiously

FRANK
We’‘ll just stay cool We’1ll just
sit on this stuff plan a new job
And it’1ll be fine It’1l be fine

But Frank doesn’t look like he thinks it’1l be fine

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

Frank and Madison sit at a table covered with an amazing
brunch Madison is reading a tablet Frank is trying to read
a book but can’t focus Still seems anxious

The garden has become full of produce tomatoes squash

The robot comes out with a fresh bloody mary for Madison

MADISON
Thanks Jeeves

Frank SNORTS glances at the robot as it goes back inside

MADISON (CONT’D)
It’s like we’re on vacation huh

FRANK
Guess so

Madison jokes around with Frank

MADISON
I think I’m going to go take a dip
in the ocean after my hot stone
massage

FRANK
Remember we have our hang-gliding
lesson after the lu’au

MADISON
Cheers

FRANK
Cheers

Frank CLINKS glasses with Madison CHUCKLES a bit too much
The robot comes back out

ROBOT
There’s someone to see you Frank
FRANK
Tell them to-

Jake steps into the backyard with the young clean-cut
from the library party SHERIFF ROWLINGS in uniform

JAKE
Hi Frank I think we surprised
your robot here This is Sheriff
Rowlings

Frank and Madison look at each other

FRANK
This is my daughter Madison And

Jake’s nervous expecting a confrontation

JAKE
You remember me I don’t buy your
whole act

MADISON
What’s going on here

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Well basically uh are you
aware your neighbors down the lane
here were recently burglarized

FRANK
No

SHERIFF ROWLINGS

name Frank Weld right

FRANK
Guilty as charged

JAKE

SHERIFF ROWLINGS

the academy So we had to come by

FRANK

So is this turd making some phoney
charge against me

JAKE
It doesn’t matter if you returned
the book Frank The donors don’t
feel secure And that’s a problem

ROWLINGS
Be on the right side this time The
Wilkerson-Lee’s are estimating the
loss at fifteen million

Frank CHOKES on his coffee almost spitting it out

FRANK
That much huh

ROWLINGS
Yeah they’re all over our asses
about it Seems Ms Lee’s father is
Chris Lee The guy who founded
Blunkiecom

FRANK
Well I have no idea what that is
Can I show you to the door

Frank gets to his feet with exaggerated effort leaning on
the robot for support

DETECTIVE ROWLINGS
Yeah I figured

Jake’s pissed off
JAKE
I know you were in my library
Frank We’re going to keep an eye
on you We can get a search warrant
like that

DETECTIVE ROWLINGS
All right come on

Rowlings pulls Jake back hitting the table and knocking the
bloody mary over

The robot instantly shoots forward and catches it
Rowlings looks at the robot in surprise then eyeballs Frank

ROWLINGS

See you

They disappear back into the house followed by the robot

MADISON
What the hell was that

FRANK
Oh whenever anything happens they
blame me It’s no big deal Maddie

MADISON
Maybe I should stay a few more
days make sure they don’t bother
you

FRANK
No it’s okay I’1l be fine

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - DAY

Madison closes the trunk of her car runs back to Frank

Frank pats around on his pockets He finds what he’s looking
for - a diamond bracelet

Madison isn’t THAT surprised She gives Frank a look

MADISON
Is this from-

FRANK
Nah It’s from the old days I was
saving it for something important
I want to donate to the cause Just
keep it out of sight until you can
pawn it somewhere far away

MADISON
I know the drill Thanks daddy

She takes it goes to her car

She turns and looks Frank up and down on the porch
MADISON (CONTD)
Be careful okay And call Hunter

Frank walks down the steps to her

FRANK
Thanks for coming

MADISON

FRANK
Yeah I think I am actually

Madison mulls this over nods and starts down the driveway

Frank watches her drive away
She drives past a repair van parked on the side of the

Frank stares at it for a moment then turns WHISPERING
robot out of the side of his mouth

FRANK (CONTD)

Smoke is coming out of Frank’s chimney

INT FRANKS HOUSE - EVENING

Still BLASTING the TV Frank is feeding his stacks of
surveillance photos notes and files into the fire

FRANK
We’ve had a few fires right It’s
not weird right

The robot comes over with his arms draped in jewels

ROBOT
What about these Frank

FRANK
Shhh Put those away

Frank grabs the jewels stuffs them back into a sack
Frank spins around frantically He looks at the trash then
outside at the trashcans - right across the street from the

van

ROBOT
Frank it’s time for bed

FRANK
SHHHH Shut your mouth Okay I got
an idea
LATER -

Frank rummages around in old drawers in his bathroom He
finds a pack of dusty condoms

The robot watches

FRANK (CONTD)

LATER -

In the kitchen Frank slips a pair of large diamond
encrusted gold earrings into a condom ties it off

ROBOT
What are you doing Frank

Frank takes a deep breath then tries to stuff the condom into
his mouth The robot grabs his arm struggles with him

ROBOT (CONT’D)
Frank I may have to medicate you
for your safety

Frank stumbles away from him

The robot presses on the wound with a clean white dish towel

FRANK (CONTD)

Back in the bathroom the robot is bandaging Frank’s hand

FRANK (CONTD)
They’re watching the house Any
excuse to let them scan OW

ROBOT
I still think you should call

behaving erratically

Frank is thinking of a plan

FRANK

ROBOT
I know you miss your son but you
could at least talk on the phone

FRANK
I don’t miss him I need him I’1l1

Frank CLAPS then grimaces in pain

ROBOT
What do you mean you’re dying

FRANK

FRANK
It’s just a little exaggeration We

The robot process this

INT HUNTER’S CAR - NIGHT

Hunter drives fast looking emotionally drained and on-edge
A phone rings over the speakers It goes to voicemail

MADISON
Hey it’s Madison Why are you
leaving me a voicemail
After the beep Hunter doesn’t speak for a moment
HUNTER
Madison I - did dad’s robot call
you Call me when you get this
Hunter hangs up
He HITS the steering wheel
HUNTER (CONTD)
FUCK
EXT FRANKS HOUSE - DAWN

It’s barely dawn The lights come on in Frank’s bedroom

The repair van is dark and perfectly quiet

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
Frank enjoys an egg white The robot refills his OJ

Frank goes back to reading but looks up at the sound of an
approaching car

FRANK
All right that’1ll be him
INT FRANK’S ROOM - MORNING
Frank sits in bed with the covers over him He is looking
through an old leather valise Satisfied he puts the valise

down beside the bed

He waits listening to Hunter talking to the robot He clears
his throat shifts his position waiting

Finally the doorknob turns and Hunter comes in followed by
the robot who brings a chair for Hunter to sit on

HUNTER
Oh thanks

Hunter sits looking over his dad with phony cheerfulness

HUNTER (CONTD)
How’re you feeling

FRANK
Haven’t got the strength to stand

HUNTER
I was telling the robot I should
drive you down to the hospital to
get checked out
Frank pats Hunter’s hand on the bed

FRANK
No no Id rather stay here

Hunter looks at him unsure of what to say

FRANK (CONTD)
There is one thing you can do

HUNTER
Dad I just want you to know I’m
sorry I didn’t come up here I just-

FRANK
Everything’s going to be fine

HUNTER
Sure Dad

This whole phony scene is more real than Frank imagined

FRANK
I need you to just do one thing
After I’m gone I don’t want

anyone finding this
Frank reaches for the valise Hunter grabs it for him

HUNTER
Oh god Dad What’s in it

FRANK
Don’t look inside You don’t need
to take any heat for this Just
don’t ask me what’s in there I
need you to hide it for me

HUNTER
Hide it Jesus Christ

FRANK
I want to leave things clean

Hunter puts the valise aside

HUNTER
Okay Don’t worry But for now
maybe-

FRANK

Actually could you do it now

HUNTER

FRANK
Id rest easier Hunter

HUNTER
Right now

FRANK
I’‘ll be fine Just put it somewhere
safe Please

HUNTER
Seriously this minute

Frank starts FAKE COUGHING

HUNTER (CONTD)
Oh god are you okay

Frank waves for him to go as he continues coughing

Hunter gets to his feet taking the valise

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - MORNING
Hunter comes down the porch to his car holding the valise

He opens the trunk stops to look the valise over for a
moment before tossing it inside

He yawns rubs his tired eyes and slowly gets into the car
his limbs stiff

He sits behind the wheel for a moment almost in a daze then
turns on the engine

As he’s pulling down the driveway the repair van suddenly
SCREECHES forward blocking Hunter’s path

Hunter brakes and stares in exhausted confusion

As he’s staring a SHERIFF’S CAR rolls down the road from the
other direction blocking more of the road

Sheriff Rowlings and a SKINNY SHERIFF jump out of the van

Jake and another YOUNG SHERIFF get out of the sheriffs car
Jake stays with the car

Hunter is starting to panic through his tired haze He looks
back at the house sees Frank and the robot standing at the
bedroom window gazing down on him dispassionately

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
GET OUT OF THE CAR

Hunter turns back to the sheriffs approaching him

HUNTER
Uh I

Fed up Sheriff Rowlings takes out his pistol The other
sheriffs follow him Jake steps behind the car door

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
HANDS IN THE AIR

Hunter gawks at the gun barrels aimed at him in shock

SHERIFF ROWLINGS (CONT’D)
GET OUT OF THE CAR - SLOWLY

Hunter gets out of the car awkwardly with his hands raised

Two sheriffs continue to cover Hunter as the third pushes him
against his car and searches him

HUNTER
What’s the problem

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
What’s in the trunk

HUNTER
Nothing Golf clubs Uh - a bag

Hunter looks back at the house Frank is still standing at
his window watching him blankly but the robot is gone

HUNTER (CONT’D)

Dad

JAKE
Don’t worry he’‘ll be coming with
us too

One sheriff opens the trunk pulls out the valise

Jake Sheriff Rowlings and the others gather around The last
sheriff staying with Hunter to hold him against the car

HUNTER
I don’t know what’s in that

Hunter looks up at his dad in the window above
HUNTER (CONTD)

I found that bag I don’t know

what’s in it I was going leave it

here at my dad’s place but I

changed my mind
Jake grabs for the bag but Sheriff Rowlings takes it
He slowly unzips it and gazes inside

Hunter watches him expectantly

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
What the hell

Rowlings dumps out the contents - a bunch of knicknacks like
the bear statuette from the candle store It’s all of Frank’s
old shoplifted items Just a bunch of junk

Hunter stares at this pile in disbelief

HUNTER
What the fuck is going on

JAKE
Why would he give him useless crap

Jake tries to break a statuette open but he’s too weak

One of the sheriffs goes to the van pulls out three SCANNING
WANDS hand-held metal detectors with a screen built in

Sheriff Rowlings sweeps his scanner over the statuettes

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
All right this is probable cause

HUNTER
Whoa hey hold on now What What
is this probable cause of

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Frank Weld’s a suspect in a multi-
million dollar robbery down the
road

HUNTER
That’s impossible he-

Hunter stops suddenly afraid that it’s all true
The sheriffs head for the front door
HUNTER (CONTD)
No wait Stop you can’t go in
there He’s sick

Just then Frank opens the front door looking just fine

FRANK
Good morning Come on inside

Jake and Hunter stare at Frank but Rowlings and the sheriffs
quickly march inside

INT FRANK’S HOUSE

The sheriffs are already going over everything with their
scanners as Hunter follows Frank inside

Jake stands awkwardly trying to look at the sheriffs
scanners but just getting in the way

HUNTER
Dad Seriously What is going on

FRANK
Just cooperating with the cops
They always come bother me whenever
anything remotely criminal happens

Hunter is still reeling staring at his dad up and down

HUNTER
But you’re - how are you feeling

FRANK
I’m fine Didn’t get much sleep
that’s all Sorry about that

Frank pats Hunter on the head gives him a wink

FRANK (CONTD)
Thanks for coming up

Hunter presses the heels of his palms against his eyes

HUNTER
Okay wait wait wait wait wait

FRANK
You boys hungry

Sheriff Rowlings suddenly turns away from his scan bumping
into Jake who was reading his screen

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Wait Where’s his robot

Rowlings gestures for the other sheriff to check the back as
he runs toward the front door

But the robot comes in from the kitchen at that moment with
a tray of food and juice

ROBOT
Who would like an omelette Three
kinds of cheese and fresh tomatoes

Sheriff Rowlings quickly scans the robot as he holds the
steaming tray out for him but his scan finds nothing

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Nothing God damn it

Suddenly Hunter starts yelling still covering his face

HUNTER
Are you KIDDING ME

JAKE
Hey asshole we have probable
cause okay So-

HUNTER
Not you - HIM

Hunter points at Frank

HUNTER (CONT’D)
Youre DYING YOURE PLAYING GAMES
ABOUT DYING I CALLED MOM I CALLED
MADISON

Frank glares at him silently
Hunter turns to the robot

HUNTER (CONTD)
AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU You’re
lying for him

He gestures at the sheriffs with scanners

HUNTER (CONTD)
Everybody get the hell out of here

JAKE
We’re not going anywhere until we
find what we’re looking for

FRANK
Don’t worry there’s nothing for
them to find

Hunter turns to Frank advancing on him Frank doesn’t move

HUNTER
You think I care If that bag was
full of whatever illegal crap
youre doing I’d hand it right
over you egotistical asshole

Frank stays quiet watching Hunter with cautious attention

HUNTER (CONTD)
You think I CARE I’m just guilty
because I AT LEAST HAVE FEELINGS
The best thing you ever did was
being locked up so I didn’t have to
be raised by you Why do you think
I left you with some shitty
bargain robot

Hunter KICKS the robot making it drop the tray of food with
a CRASH

ROBOT
Warning - do not molest me

FRANK
Hey Leave him out of this

HUNTER
It’s a ROBOT dad It’s not your
friend It’s your slave who you can
apparently bullshit into doing just
about anything

(MORE)

HUNTER (CONTD)
Which I guess is perfect since you
can’t stand to be around anyone who
sees through your bullshit

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Wait a minute We can just download
this thing’s memory and that’s
everything we need
Frank looks away from Hunter shocked

FRANK
You can’t do that

ROBOT
I’m afraid they can Frank

Frank makes a move toward the robot but Rowlings pulls his
gun

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Back up Frank

JAKE
Let me do this

Jake and the two sheriffs grab the robot and start opening
his panels looking around

SKINNY SHERIFF
How do you turn this thing off

The robot struggles against them Suddenly he goes still

JAKE
There we go

The robot starts speaking at an INCREASED VOLUME

ROBOT
SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE INITIALIZED

Jake and the sheriffs look at each other

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
It’s bullshit

ROBOT
TEN NINE

Everyone looks to Frank Frank starts to back away towards
the door

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Frank - you didn’t

ROBOT

Frank gives a little shrug playing super-scared

FRANK
I’d run

Rowlings is still aiming at Frank

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
Don’t move

ROBOT
FIVE-

Frank ducks out the front door gone in a second
Hunter sits down

HUNTER
He’s lying

Hunter just shakes his head at the robot
HUNTER
What a hunk of crap
EXT FRANKS HOUSE

The sheriffs and Jake are still running from the house

They stop
It’s been more than ten seconds
They look at each other in growing embarrassment

SHERIFF ROWLINGS
FUCK

Suddenly Hunter’s seemingly empty car starts up and rolls
forward

SHERIFF ROWLINGS (CONT’D)
Frank Freeze

The car circles around to the house the sheriffs chasing
The robot comes outside Frank pulls past opens the door

FRANK
Get in

The robot slowly goes down the stairs The sheriffs close in

Just in time the robot slips into the back Frank zooms past
the sheriffs who have to jump out of the way

Frank SLAMS into the sheriffs car spinning it clear He
drives away down the road out of sight in a few seconds

The sheriffs and Jake are getting back to their feet as
Hunter comes out of the house

HUNTER
Nice job
INT HUNTER’S CAR - MORNING

Frank drives a bit out of practice He keeps running along
the shoulder

The robot leans over from the back seat

ROBOT
It’s not too late You can reformat
my memory It’s the only way for
you to remain safe and healthy

FRANK
Can’t you erase just the bad parts

ROBOT
My memory is a holographic array
if I lost half of it I’d still
have every memory just in half the-

FRANK
You can’t just lobotomize yourself
Without your memory You’re the
best lock picker in the world

ROBOT
I don’t mind It’s like I explained
to you I’m not a real person

FRANK
Fuck that It’s your memory It’s
not a problem We’1ll lay low until

we get a chance to go back for the
stuff Then we’re out of here

EXT JENNIFERS HOUSE - MORNING
Frank pulls up in front of Jennifers place

Frank gets out stretching his legs The robot joins him

ROBOT
Are we going to ‘lay low’ here

FRANK
I hope

Frank walks up and knocks on the door quietly at first But
after a moment of silence again louder

Jennifer opens the door

JENNIFER
What’s going on Hunter called me

FRANK
Hunter called you When Did you
tell him anything

JENNIFER
Tell him anything about what
Frank what do you want

FRANK
To apologize Can I please come in

Jennifer sighs and lets him in

INT JENNIFER’S HOUSE - MORNING

The robot is in the kitchen cleaning up with Mr Darcy they
keep accidentally opening drawers into each other

MR DARCY

ROBOT

MR DARCY

ROBOT

Frank is sitting with Jennifer eating breakfast

FRANK
This is nice Like we’re a family

JENNIFER
Why did you really come over here

Frank gets up looks around at Jennifers stuff - some
seashells and books on a shelf etc

FRANK
I‘1l be honest with you I’m ina
little bit of trouble

JENNIFER
Aren’t you always

FRANK
This is a worse than late fees

Frank is looking at a number of photos on the wall - old
black and white ones of family members long gone

Jennifer stands beside him gently turns his head away from
the photos to look at her

JENNIFER
What is it You remember something

FRANK
No - I I’m kind of on the lam

Jennifer’s expression drops into deep anxiety

JENNIFER
On the lam

FRANK
I have kind of a colorful history
I I’m a catburgler

JENNIFER

You took “Don Quixote” didn’t you
FRANK Goddamn it

Frank is surprised by how quickly she is putting all of this
together

FRANK
I returned it

The robot and Mr Darcy peer in from the kitchen

FRANK (CONTD)
The cops are after me Hunter-

Jennifer steps away almost dazed talking to herself

JENNIFER
I should have known I should
have been more involved

Frank hangs his head turns away and looks back at the
picture wall

Suddenly a puzzled expression comes over him

He leans in closely to a picture - it’s Jennifer at a younger
age She’s beautiful

FRANK
Is that you

JENNIFER
Oh Frank

Frank looks at the next picture - it’s the same picture of
Hunter Madison and him he kept in his secret drawer But
this version is whole Frank can see the younger Jennifer
with her arm on his shoulder

FRANK
What the fuck

Frank turns back to Jennifer sees her angry tears
Frank looks at another picture and another - Madison and

Jennifer on the beach Hunter Jennifer at a graduation Frank
and Jennifer young sitting on a couch with a dog

FRANK (CONTD)
Holy shit Jennifer-

JENNIFER
I’m calling Hunter

Frank grabs her arm
FRANK
No You can’t he’s working with
the cops
Jennifer starts sobbing

Frank pulls away from her

JENNIFER
You’re not well Frank You-

Frank stumbles for the door the robot holds him steady

INT HUNTER’S CAR - DAY
Frank can barely drive the car He’s falling into a daze

FRANK
How could I not remember HOW
COULD I NOT REMEMBER Almost

ROBOT
Frank you’re okay I’m right here
Pull over and well figure it out

The robot leans forward and steadies the wheel

ROBOT (CONT’D)
Frank Frank Frank

Frank’s driving almost automatically
FRANK

for our hike

ROBOT
It is getting close to that time
Frank

FRANK

stake-out a target

ROBOT
That’s right Frank We’ll stick to
the schedule
EXT FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

Frank casually drives up the road past the van The smashed
sheriffs car is gone He pulls up to the house

The van starts rocking and Rowlings jumps out with one
sheriff and Hunter They’re all surprised to see Frank

Frank almost inside turns and sees them

FRANK
What the fuck am I doing

Frank hurries up the steps and runs into the house followed
by the robot

ROWLINGS
Hold it right there Frank Freeze

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY
Frank runs inside in a panic

FRANK
Upstairs Quick

Frank lurches upstairs the robot following him
ROBOT
Frank you know what we have to do
INT FRANKS ROOM - DAY

Frank locks the door behind the robot starts pulling the
sheets off the bed grabbing extras from the closet

FRANK
We’ll lure ‘em up here then scale
down from the window

Frank starts tying the bedsheets together into a rope

ROBOT
Frank stop Just wipe my memory

FRANK
I can’t erase your memory
The sound of the sheriffs bursting filters up

ROBOT
Frank I know you don’t like to
hear this but I am not a person
I’m just an advanced simulation

FRANK
This is crazy

ROBOT
After you’ve wiped my memory
things can go back to normal
Frank stops tying sheets together SIGHS in frustration
ROBOT (CONT’D)
- and you can continue planning
your next job

The robot’s words hit Frank like a jolt

FRANK
What

The sheriffs are POUNDING on the door

SHERIFF ROWLINGS (0S)
Frank Don’t touch that robot

ROBOT
Remember Frank Your next job You
deal in diamonds and jewels The
most value by the ounce Remember

Frank is staring at the robot in surprise

FRANK
Of course I remember

ROBOT
Lifting that kind of stuff no one
gets hurt And if I’m confiscated
teach Hunter or Madison your lock
picking system You have to remain
active

SHERIFF ROWLINGS (0S)
Frank We’re kicking the door in

Frank stares at the robot as if he’s seeing it for the first
time his own face REFLECTED in its astronaut-helmet head

FRANK
I never meant—

HUNTER (0S)
Dad

Frank looks up at the door at the sound of his son’s voice
FRANK
(turning to robot)
Show me what to do
ROBOT
You have to open this side panel by
twisting counter-clock-wise

Frank works on opening the robot’s hidden panel like picking
a lock His fingers work deftly opening the panel

FRANK
I knew you had an off switch liar

Frank grabs the robot into a hug He hugs Frank back as his
LED BLINKS a few times then goes dark

The door is KICKED IN

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT MEMORY CENTER - FRANKS ROOM - DAY

Frank sits on the bed in his institutional room He has a few
personal touches - locks framed on the wall photos

Frank reads a crumbling mystery novel when Hunter walks in
Hunter stands a bit sheepishly while Frank keeps reading

HUNTER
Dad

Hunter looks up

FRANK
Oh hey uh how’re you doing

HUNTER
It’s Hunter

FRANK
Hunter Hunter yeah have a seat
How’re you doing

HUNTER
Want to come on a walk with me

Frank slowly sets the book down and gets to his feet looks
around for his slippers

FRANK
Sounds good So how’s Princeton

Hunter helps steady Frank as they walk to the door

HUNTER
Princeton Um it’s good

FRANK
Just good Hey - it’s Princeton
That’s one thing I don’t have to
worry about You turned out better
than your old man

Hunter doesn’t know what to say

INT MEMORY CENTER - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk out into the hallway Frank stops short he turns
back to Hunter his eyes full of confusion again

FRANK
Hey there uh how’re you doing

Hunter is disheartened for a moment but turns and gives his
dad a warm smile

HUNTER
How’re you doing Dad

FRANK
Me

Hunter leads Frank around the corner where Madison and
Jennifer are waiting with lunch They stand up

Frank looks them over recognition coming back into his eyes

FRANK (CONTD)
Never better

Frank sits down with his family to eat

They talk mostly among themselves and Frank listens
focusing in on their expressions laughing when they laugh
He’s drinking them in enjoying them

When they’re finishing a nurse comes back to collect Frank

Frank hugs Madison Jennifer kisses him on the cheek which
makes him smile

Hunter awkwardly goes to hug him but Frank shakes his hand
instead and walks off down the hallway with the nurse

Madison and Jennifer turn to head out

Hunter looks into his hand - Frank slipped him a note
Madison notices looks over his shoulder

MADISON
What’s it say

Hunter unfolds it reading
HUNTER
“Check the robot’s garden under the
tomatoes Have fun kids Dad”
They look back up Frank gives a wave and disappears down the
hallway Hunter sighs

INT MEMORY CENTER - HALLWAY

Frank is about to enter his room when he stops short Down
the hall he sees the Robot

For a moment it seems to recognize him but then it turns
away helping another patient It’s not Franks robot

With a wistful smile Frank turns and enters his room

CUT TO BLACK
