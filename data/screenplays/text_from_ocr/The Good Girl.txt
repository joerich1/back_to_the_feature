THE GOOD GIRL

Written by

Mike White

JUSTINE
(vo) As a girl you see the world
like a giant candy store filled with
sweet candy and such But one day you
look around and see a prison and youre
on death row You wanna run or scream
or cry But somethings locking you
up Are the other folks cows chewing
cud till the hour come and their heads
roll Or are they just keeping quiet
like you Planning their escape

(Camera zooms on HoldenTom)

JUSTINE
Sorry I’m just a little tired

GWEN
Its the food you eat Justine Look
at me I am 10 years older than you
and have 10 times your energy Cause
I dont eat meat and I dont eat dairy
Its probably why you cant get pregnant
honey And why you have that hung-jaw
look on your face Its the cheese in
your pizza and the chicken in your salad

JUSTINE
I went to the doctor He says Im fertile
He says I could repopulate the entire
planet

GWEN
Then whats the deal here Did he say
you get enough vitamins

JUSTINE
He didnt say

PHIL
You could make paint where at different
angles the house is different colours
You stand at the front door and the
house is red You stand at the street
and the house is green Or you could
make like an invisible paint Make
the whole house disappear

BUBBA
What would be really neat is a paint
that could change the molecular structure
of a house like a chemical acid deal

JUSTINE
Holden gave me two of his stories to
read Its like what a story would be
I was about a boy who was put upon
his mother was cold and selfish and
his father wanted him to play football
Other people didnt get him especially
girls Then the boy comes to believe
no one can ever really know him So
he starts actin out drinkin and
doin all kinds of drugs At the end
the boy kills himself but jumpin over
abridge The second story was pretty
much the same as the first Except at
the end the boy kills himself by drinkin
a bottle of bug poison

JUSTINE
Your stories are intense

HOLDEN
I just wanna leave some kind of legacy
Somethin great After that I dont
care what happens to me

JUSTINE
Dont say that I wish there was a story
about me I dont know who would read
it though

of Gwens body rottin away I thought
of how nice a person she was so full

JUSTINE
Thanks

(Justine arrives at Bubbas He opens the door and his
dog Bitz
is barking)

BUBBA
Easy Bitz easy Bitz Back in your corner
Back in your corner Back in your corner
Bitz Come on in I wanna show you somethin’
Sit (Yells at dog again) Im in shock

JUSTINE
Why

BUBBA
You know why

JUSTINE
Bubba sat like that for what seemed
like ten years before he began to speak
Finally when he opened his mouth he
talked a blue streak about the ruin
that was his life He talked about how
he loved Phil and how he loved me
And how he always wanted a girlfriend
just like me and to be a guy like Phil
to this imaginary girl like me that
he never found Then he wen on about
givin up your dreams and how its all
a part of gettin older Bubba had given
up on his dream to be like Phil and
accepted his fate as Bubba always and
forever Then last week a door that
remained shut swung wide open Bubba
thought this no chance coincidence
a cosmic force was at work The sounds
of me makin love to a man that wasnt
Phil was like a shout in Bubbas ear
from the creator himself What it meant
or what to do or why Bubba didnt know
All he knew was that he hated me for
poisoning the well of idealism that
he had drunk from for so long I was
no longer Bubbas image of perfection
To him I was just a liar and a whore
and that sickened him But on the other
hand he loved me for opening his eyes
and releasing him from the bitter chains
of evny that bound him to Phil Phil
was no superman just a cuckhold and
a foll and that was beautiful Bubba
felt that there was just one thing left
for us to do Something that would solve
both our problems and end this whole
tragic cycle

JUSTINE
Bubba I am not gonna sleep with you

BUBBA
But dont you see This is my chance
for liberation

JUSTINE
But one persons liberation is another
persons well badness Theres just
no way

BUBBA
Im gonna have to tell Phil then

JUSTINE
Why

BUBBA
Hes my best friend I cant keep him
in the dark about somethin this big
Hes a cuckhold

JUSTINE
You wanna cuckhold him yourself

BUBBA
Well thats different That isnt about
him Thats about my salvation Look
youve got your choice to make Either
destroy your marriage and break your
husbands heart Or have sex with me
right now

(Bubba is yelling at the dog again and saying
Justines name)
JUSTINE
Oh god There was someone in the window
Did you not see

BUBBA
Youre paranoid

JUSTINE
I gotta go

BUBBA
Phil is never gonna find out about any
of this Dont fret (the dog is still
barking)

JUSTINE
Get this damn dog away from me

BUBBA
Youre lookin at a free man Justine
A free man

JUSTINE
Great Good for you

BUBBA
Thank you (Yelling at dog again)
(TV sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom still
brushing
his teeth)

PHIL
Im nervous

JUSTINE
Youre nervous Why

PHIL
Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow
and jism into a cup thats why What
if I cant do it

JUSTINE
You can do it

PHIL
You know If you said youd help me

be on your lunch hour anyway

JUSTINE

Holden
in the car more depressed than ever)

JUSTINE

Justine

JUSTINE
Oh I I promise (car is parked somewhere
Justine and Holden are sitting on the
car Holdens smoking)

JUSTINE
I realized then that Holden was at best
a child and at worst a demon If I
was ever gonna go straight Id have
to ditch him Sometimes to get back
on the road to redemption you have
to make a few pit stops

(Justine goes up to the Blackberry Man)

JUSTINE

BLACKBERRY MAN

her the blackberries) There you go

day to day We gotta chart a course

eats a blackberry and then smiles) Theyre
sweet If I could only get my hands
on some money someone could just tell
me the answer I gotta do But If I
ever do I end up thinking about it
instead I gotta do But do what (Justine
pushes the blackberry hes about to
eat away from his mouth) What What

JUSTINE
They looked dirty I I think I saw
a bug in them or something
(Jack talking to Holden about something)

(Justines talking to Holdens parents)

ill He has this idea in his head that
weve had some sort of affair Which

devil knows Retail Rodeo was at the
corner on my left the motel was down
the road to my right I closed my eyes
and tried to peer into the future On
my left I saw days upon days of lipstick
and ticking clocks Dirty looks and
quiet whisperings and burning secrets
that wont ever die away And on my
right what could I picture The blue
sky the desert earth streching out
into the eerie infinity A beautiful
never ending nothing

CHERYL

hat day I read the story Holden wrote
or me It was kinda different from
he other one but kinda the same It
as about a woman who was put upon
hose job was a prison and whose life
ad lost all meaning Other people dont
et her especially her husband One
ay she meets a boy who is also put
pon and they fall in love After spending
heir whole lives not getting got with
one look they get eachother completely
In the end the boy and the girl run
away together in the wilderness never
to be heard from again
