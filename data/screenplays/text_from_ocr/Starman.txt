DRAFT SCRIPT

FADE IN
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very

faintly
through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue
rack
lights of a police car coming toward us It drops into
a
dip reappears almost immediately hurtling down the
center
of the deserted highway It gets closer and closer
until the
lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us
INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT
A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the
back
seat his hands clutched into the fabric between the
two
regular POLICE OFFICERS in front
GUARD
(an edge of fear in
his voice)
Its coming up Slow down
(he points out between
them)
There right there
Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick
up a

billboard announcing a new housing development

The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the
starts up a rutted dirt road The sign tells us we are

for Pinewood Estates

a housing development financed
the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin
INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT
The Security Guard is becoming more agitated He wipes
cold sweat off his brow The blue flashers reflect off
fog onto the faces of the men Suddenly the Security
lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren

OFFICER

(startled)

Benny God take it easy

BENNY (GUARD)
I dont want to scare them away

The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look
EXT HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

Using only its parking lights the police car creeps up
dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses

INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT

The windows are rolled down Periodically one of the
leans out for a better look at the terrain around them

SECOND OFFICER
Smells smoke

BENNY
I told you

EXT HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT
The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and

Above them on the next hill a necklace of embers from
grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog
The
men get out of the car

BENNY
(loud whisper)
There Up on the hill

The officer steps forward for a better look Benny
hangs on
his shoulder

BENNY
Right in line with that burning tree

OFFICER
I dont see anything

BENNY
Its there The fogs thicker now
but its there What do you think
started those fires

The officer strains to see through the fog

OFFICER
Benny theres nothing there

BENNY
There is They came out of the belly
of the ship and then went to the
first terrace and flew down into the
houses

OFFICER
Flew Oh come on Benny

The second officer is peering intently at something
down
among the houses

OFFICER
You hear that Mike Now hes telling
us

MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)
Whats that

Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing
What

appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs
among
the houses below them Further into the track another

beam
of light moves slightly from right to left but seems
otherwise
stationary
BENNY
What did I tell you
OFFICER
Probably kids
One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the
other
side
MIKE

Probably
EXT HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT
A light shines directly into our eyes As it swings
away
from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the
police
car which is idling along the dirt road with its
running
lights off The fire on the hill gives the fog down
here a
red tint
INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT
The police officers are beginning to feel anxious
Bennys
nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesnt help them
any
BENNY
Dont you think you should call a
backup

No we can handle this

over the sides of an industrial dumpster As we watch
hear an eerie high pitched whistle a shaft of light
rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between
houses

INT FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture
window a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside

silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen It
a hand to eye level There is a sharp SNAP and a
cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the
of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image

EXT HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT
The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt
Benny and the officers are intent on a light that
them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in
direction of the fire on the hill The police
swings onto the house
OFFICER
(over outside speakers)
This is the police Identify

It is deathly silent

and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground They

Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched
sweep by on his left He turns slowly to see through

ribs of an unfinished house a shaft of the white light
pointing at a cement mixer

BENNY
(to the officers his
voice cracking)
Theres one over here

The brilliant light swings toward him Benny his hands
trembling raises the gun

BENNY
Stop Police

The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a
shots The light goes out immediately
MIKE
(in Bennys direction)

What happened

BENNY
I think I shot one

MIKE
Jesus Benny What are you doing

INT FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure It
to a high window and looks out The reddish tinge of
outlines him

MIKE
Okay

Benny continues around the house He flashes his light
a doorway There is nothing but framing When he moves
figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space
raises its arms With a sharp snap cylindrical devices
off its wrist into its hands

At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and

The high pitched whistle starts behind him He stumbles
to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him

OFFICER

Benny this is me Im going to take

Bennys beam flashes back

BENNY
Dont leave me Im coming

The two men begin to trot toward the light It swings
around and accompanied by the high-pitched whistle

to stagger back up the hill Benny and the officer
into a run They are on their way up the hill when the
in front of them crashes to the earth It rolls over
lays still the beam shooting straight up into the air
and the officer slow their pursuit terrified of what
might find Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing

INT FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into
kitchen An indistinct image plays on the inside of its
faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive
language Through the window over the sink we can see
lights of the spaceship

The rockets flip into the humanoids gloved hands and
airborne out the open back door

EXT HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

From the road Benny and the officer watch as the
figure that just blasted over them flies between the
and into the white light emitting from the underbelly
spacecraft The noise from the ships power plant is
as it begins to rise above the trees

With Mike at the wheel the police car its rack lights
flashing fishtails up the dirt road and slides

a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer As
jump out of the way they find themselves facing into
super white beam of the figure that was in the house

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close
shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit By the
identification light that flickers on and off inside
helmet we see a MAN FROM THE STARS His skin is

coral He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his

DRIVER (VO)
It musta been a bird

PARTNER (VO)
How about if I drive now

Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off
the shining mass in the STAR MANS head and moves down
neck Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at
top of his single lung The white light spreads

the organ like a phosphorescent tide The STAR MAN
into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away

time of day

MAJOR BELL (MAN)
Very beautiful country up here

SHERMIN
Any signs of biological contamination
excessive radiation anything like
that
MAJOR BELL
Not on the landscape Were trying
to get a tube under the faceplate
for a reading on possible deadly
lifeforms but its hard going

SHERMIN
Can you see under the faceplate

MAJOR BELL
No

Bells hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the
one

in his mouth

SHERMIN
Theres a good chance you could be
wrong about this thing then

MAJOR BELL
Waitll you see it

He throws away the cigarette and begins to put on his

contamination hood Shermin follows as they start for
the

tent

MAJOR BELL
We had a flight of F16s play tag
with the spaceship over Michigan for
an hour Then it shot straight up
and disappeared

SHERMIN
Was there visual contact

MAJOR BELL
No sir Radar

swear theres another one that didnt
make the ship It might be alive

SHERMIN
People have made mistakes in these
situations before

MAJOR BELL

Ive been investigating sightings

for seventeen years Mr Shermin

This ones real We have a dead extra-

terrestrial in that tent and another

one in the area that might be alive

Weve been visited Its finally

happened and the sooner Washington

accepts that and starts figuring out

how were going to deal with these

beings the better off were going

to be
EXT FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK
It is still raining
The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start He parts
tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his
body It has changed in color from brown to a rich
ocher He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere
his lung expands and contracts easily He conducts a
inventory of his damaged spacesuit then struggles to

didnt they contact us first and
say

SHERMIN
Lock in

RADAR TECHNICIAN
Got it

Lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their
tracking

units and the views of the forest on three of the
television
screens change to images from their microwave scanners

neutron back scatters and doppler radar On a fourth
screen

the forward-looking infrared module begins creating a
picture

of the UFO The men relax as they recognize the
configurations

of a light sea plane

LYMAN
This is crazy What were we going to
do if that had been the ship We
have two thirty calibre machine guns
three M16s and some handguns

SHERMIN
Give it a rest Lyman

MAJOR BELL
(after a pause)
Ive never once heard of anybody
being hurt by an extraterrestrial

Shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps
to the

radio operator He begins to flip through a stack of
telex

messages

LYMAN
Thats because the ones that were
hurt died They couldnt talk to
you

SHERMIN
(to technician after
a look at Lyman)
Any reports about monsters people
in Halloween masks anything like
that

TECHNICIAN
No but there sure were a lot of
people who saw lights in the sky
last night Reports are still coming
in

Fox

He taps a three digit code and Fox comes into view

FOX
Ive got something for you

A photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops
on a second screen next to Fox Above lines of glowing
dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom pulsars a nude

a woman and Earths position in our solar system

FOX
Recognize this

MAJOR BELL
Its a copy of the plaque NASA sent
into space on the Pioneer probes

FOX
Houston found it in the
extraterrestrials suit

MAJOR BELL
They must have picked it up in space

SHERMIN
Then its not an accident that they
found us

FOX

We dont think thats necessarily
bad At least its a point of contact

SHERMIN
Not necessarily bad If they knew we
were here why didnt they let us
know they were coming

FOX
Well get those answers when you
find the one youre looking for

SHERMIN
Thats not going to happen George
unless you get us the help you
promised us

FOX
Weve been back and forth on this
all day and keeping in mind the panic
that would occur if this got to the
general public its been decided
not to expand the search at this
time

SHERMIN
Dont let them do it this way George
Its too important We cant find
this thing alone

FOX
You have to Were trying to contact
the ship If we do Ill let you
know immediately Good luck

some form of energy flows from the

in the wrong hole halfway down the front he looks like
innocent abroad He notices the shirt is askew across
chest and with his new hands awkwardly resets the

The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to

his face He squeezes the skin on his cheeks examines

sides

of his face folds his ears forward to check the skin
behind

them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his
hair to

see if it is on securely

He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the 45
and

a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the
bed

next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has
taken

The STAR MAN spots a station on the other side of the
Interstate

STAR MAN

He taps the fuel gauge which has dipped below empty

STAR MAN
No gas

They both scan the horizon for a gas station When one

in the wallet It is of the man he has become He is
leaning
against a fire truck in uniform

down

Jennys cheek

Like closing a zipper she slides her fingers across
her
mouth

JENNY
Mouth closed closed

The STAR MAN does as he is told He doesnt like it

but he
does it With his lips puckered he looks straight down
the
road The car rises out of a gulley Topping a knoll
straight
ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign
revolving
above it With his lips firmly pressed together he
tugs
Jennys sleeve and points
JENNY
I see it
The STAR MAN reaches forward and squeezes the satel
compass
back into his palms

Attendant is
already coming around the front of the car

The STAR MAN stuffs the gun into the left pocket of his

baggy
cords just as the Attendant arrives at the drivers
door
ATTENDANT

The STAR MAN looks at Jenny for help She sweeps her
fingers
across her mouth to indicate her lips are sealed The
STAR
MAN peeks around her at the Attendant

trots after her

for a moment then takes a long look at the mens room

room It is locked Not knowing what to do the STAR
stands uncomfortably in front of the door then like a
waiting for his mother he sits on the curb He watches

Attendant lift the Mustangs hood and reach in for the
dipstick The numbers on the pumps turn over adding up

gallons and the cost of the gas

Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of
cast by the gas station The STAR MAN pulls the camera
out of his pocket and points it at the pumps The cone
light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional
The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the
MAN who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture
The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming
the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to
feet

He is startled by the image of the RIDER In a one

driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space
traveller The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a

look and mutters something to himself in his language

The riders approach frightens the STAR MAN He backs
the ladies room door and knocks There is no answer
tries the knob With the other hand he inches the gun
out of his pocket

there are alien bacteria there her body would not like

JENNY
Eh you keep it Ive had enough

The STAR MAN takes another drink He stops dead when he

realizes

the
paper towel off his lap and flaps it in her face
jabbing at

STAR MAN

Jenny cant take it anymore and screams back at him
through
tears
JENNY
Kidnapped is what youre doing to me

at me and taking me from my house
Kidnapped is changing yourself into

Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND

STAR MAN
What

It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while then
reaches

in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray
marbles He
rolls it between his palms It changes to a glowing

gold as
it grows to the size of a baseball
JENNY

What are you doing
The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and
speaks
into it

easy to learn Will arrive on time
Wait for me
The STAR MAN opens his hands and to Jennys
astonishment
the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof
without
leaving a trace

Its not Jennys With a buzz the red dot appears and
Foxs

face interrupts the view of the Mustang

FOX (VO)

I just came from a meeting with the
Security Council and

(the picture breaks

up but the voice

continues)
in view of the extraterrestrials
radical change and the fact that all
our efforts

(the picture re-

assembles)
to contact its ship remain unanswered
it was decided to issue a ten state
all points bulletin for Scott Haydn
Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang
The officers have been instructed
not to approach the people or the
vehicle but to contact you You will
then move in and contain the subjects

Shermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests
this

SHERMIN
(sorting it out)
You sure you want this because
thats putting an awful lot of faith
in people we have no control over

FOX (VO)
Im afraid the situation demands
that kind of risk

SHERMIN
I dont like it George

asking for help Whats changed

A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a

likely

hiding place He moves through the underbrush toward
it

Without warning his feet begin to slip out from under
him

He struggles to regain his balance

When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a
RAGING

RIVER 150 feet below The bank on the other side is
just a

few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can
see a

flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the
distance

Slowly he backs away from the edge of the cliff

From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out
over

the ravine Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching
the

treeline The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny
and

the light passes without picking them up The STAR MAN
adjusts

his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite

searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash

men in the field He sees that their guns are drawn and
pointed in his direction The STAR MAN pulls back and

a marble from his pouch It grows and glows gold as the
MAN rolls it between his palms When it reaches the

a baseball he clutches it firmly in his right hand and
EMPTIES the 45 toward Shermin and the police This

there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE

looking past her left hand at the road when she notices

(takes a pack of Camels
out of his pocket)
You dont get rich as a cook either

STAR MAN

COOK

The STAR MAN takes it quickly examines it then
it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did His
raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on
end of his cigarette
The butane flame is swung in his direction and he
back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel He
the Cooks puffing and the end of his cigarette begins
glow
COOK

She wants to become a doctor Shes

a bright kid Hard worker I think

shell make it But the damned

inflations driven the tuition up so

high it makes it real tough ona

family like ours

The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows

at the windshield The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation

chokes His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he

to be cool and not cough The Cook takes no notice of
struggles

COOK
I got two other kids I dont know
what well do when they get old enough
for college

Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Mans nose and
mouth
Puzzled he re-examines his cigarette

COOK
Everybody blames it on the oil crisis
That might be where it starts But I
think a lot of people are just using
that as an excuse to rip the rest of
us off I see it every day in the
kitchen Peaches We use the gallon
cans The price has gone up three
times in the last year And now the
cans are only half full

The Cook takes another drag As if etiquette required
it

the STAR MAN hurries to copy him This time there are
no ill

effects

COOK
Do you have children

STAR MAN
No

COOK
Theyre damned expensive and a pain
in the ass sometimes but I wouldnt
trade having them for anything

The Cook flicks his ash out of the window A moment
later

the STAR MAN mirrors his action
