FADE FROM WHITE

ON A WINDING ROAD

lined with a wooden guide rail FOG rolls by as a FIGURE
approaches obscuring who or what IT is

As IT gets closer its gait can be discerned --

HUMANOID

ITS build is oversized yet solid -- and ITS face has two
LARGE BLACK EYES that cut clearly through the white snow
and fog like miniature black holes

IT continues to walk closer and a hand reaches up and PULLS
OFF THE EYES -- which are actually GOGGLES -- revealing ITS
identity

FIGURE
My name is Olatunde Osunsanmi the
director of 4TH KIND

Olatunde continues walking towards us his heavy winter
clothing bulking up his frame

OLATUNDE

This film will be a dramatization of

oe events that occurred October lst
through the 9th of 2000 in the
northern Alaskan town of Nome To
better explain the events of this
story I have included actual archived
footage throughout the film This
footage was obtained from Nome
psychiatrist Dr Abbey Tyler who
has personally documented over 65
hours of video and audio materials
during the time of the incidents
In an effort to protect their privacy
we have altered the names and
professions of many of the people
involved

(pause)

Every dramatized scene in this film
will be supported by either archived
audio video or as it was related
to me by Dr Tyler herself during
extensive interview sessions In
the end what you believe will be
yours to decide

Olatunde comes to a stop as breath rises from his mouth
OLATUNDE
Please be advised that some of what
you are about to see is extremely
disturbing

FADE IN
IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM

Several 50 inch WIDESCREEN MONITORS are mounted on the walls
creating a collage of ABSTRACT MOTION on their screens

THE REAL ABBEY TYLER sits in a chair the camera frames her
from the waist up

She is a thirty-eight year old female with a good deal of
pain evident in her eyes Shes rail thin edges of bones
pushing out her skin like needles under tissue paper

The left corner of her mouth twitches occasionally as she
looks to the right of camera where the interviewer sits

next to Will His eyes are open darting back and forth as

they study her

A shadow falls over Wills face and then
METAL SLAMS DOWN

into his

CHEST

BLASTING into his SKIN as

BLOOD EXPLODES UPWARDS

Abbey breaths in sharply and pulls back in SHOCK

up at the INTRUDER -- and FLINCHES back and
SCREAMS --
- FADE OUT LEFT FRAME --
RIGHT FRAME NOW FILLS ENTIRE SCREEN

Abbey SHRIEKS

She looks

at the top of her lungs and covers her face with her arms

TIMECODE 000243

ABBEY
Oh my God Someone stabbed him In
the chest Oh my G--

CAMPOS
Abbey Stay with me Stay with me
What do you see

ABBEY
I dont know I--its too much

Dr Campos tries to regain control counts her back out of
hypnosis as she wails uncontrollably

CAMPOS
--Focus on my voice--

ABBEY
-HES BLEEDING EVERYWHERE THERES
BLOOD ALL OVER ME-

CAMPOS
-Focus on my voice you will be fully
awakened and conscious in 54321

Abbey breaks hypnosis sits up doesnt remember crying
wipes tears sits a moment silently awkwardly before burying
her face in her hands and crying

Campos puts an arm around her shoulders

CAMPOS
Abbey

She cries for a little bit longer and then wipes her eyes

ABBEY
If I could just see his face we
couldI--feel soHe was killed
and I was right there--and I--I--
cant described who did it
CAMPOS
Its natural to feel guiltits
just as unnatural to feel it was
your fault

She wipes her face again
ABBEY

(whispers)
I cant help it

CAMPOS
You said something thereyou said
rts too much What did you mean

by that
Abbey thinks a momentand then slowly shakes her head

ABBEY
I dont know

CAMPOS
It feels like maybe itssomething
we should keep an eye on

Campos holds her hands in a very paternal way trying to
comfort her

TIMECODE 000457

CAMPOS
You should consider taking some time
off -- real time That two weeks
didnt count It may help you find
clarity with what happened--

ABBEY
I want to finish the study

CAMPOS
Which is exactly what I knew youd
say Which is what you always say
when confronted with the notion of
spending time away from work Uncle
Sam isnt exactly beating down your
door for a return on his investment

Abbey shakes her head
ABBEY
It meant a lot to Will He would of
wanted me to finish it as soon as I
could

C£E Campos look --

ABBEY
Ill be OK

She stands up abruptly lifting her face out of frame wiping
stray tears attempting to pull it together

ABBEY
I know you wouldnt but please dont
tell anyone about our sessions
(small smile)
Wouldnt be good for my practice

CAMPOS
Of course

SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS -- their rolling hills of white are
blindingly beautiful

THE REAL DR TYLER (V0)
I think Alaskans are lucky in that
way--that flying is one of the only
ways to get around the state

The plane SOARS UP and over another MOUNTAIN RANGE revealing
a town nestled next to the sparkling waters of the ARCTIC oy
and the MONSTROUS blue-white ice of a GLACIER behind it a

Father comits murder-suicide

By Kate Ripple
Fairbanks Daily News

Nome Alaska - Tommy Fisher murdered
his wife and two children before committing
suicide yesterday night at approximately 330
AM following several hours of hostage 2¢6-
otiations Authorities have yet to determine
motivation and no pote was left behind

er

—

Neighbors have commented that Tommy fr-
equently complained of insomia and i
regular visits to psychiatrist Homicide in
Nome is higher than the state average due to
multiple unsolved murder and missing persoa
cases dating back to the 1960s

—

ABBEY
Yeah

AUGUST
How do you know what he saw was real

Shes quiet a moment

ABBEY
I dont know that it was

AUGUST
So what youre telling me is that
Tommy might have done all of this
based on something that may not exist
at all

ABBEY
All I know is that he believed what
he saw And I saw more fear in his
eyes than Ive ever seen in my life

AUGUST
Had you not hypnotized him would he
have done these things

ABBEY
What do you mean

a AUGUST

If you hadnt hypnotized him would
he have murdered his family

ABBEY
Thats a ridiculous and offensive
questi--

AUGUST

--Whats ridiculous and offensive is
that an entire family is lying in
the morgue from a murder suicide and
the last meaningful contact the
murderer had was with you

ABBEY
What happened last night would have
manifested itself eventually
Whatever it was it was something
hed been suppressing In eleven
years of practice Ive never--

AUGUST
--Why didnt you notify us If you
suspected that he was unstable after
ms an admittedly violent episode in
and your presence in your office--

ABBEY
--When he left he was perfectly
coherent I called his wife and
asked her to keep an eye on him

AUGUST
And now shes dead

Abbey rises to her feet her eyes blazing

ABBEY

Im not gonna sit here--
AUGUST

Sit down
ABBEY

--and listen to your theories on how
hypnosis induced murder--

AUGUST
Sit Down

ABBEY
--caused this--

AUGUST
Im trying to figure out what caused
one of the worst homicides in the
history of Nome--

ABBEY
--Theres something going on in this
town that we dont understand
Theres something happening to people
when they sleep--

AUGUST
--I deal in what I see not
hallucinations Not visions in the
ether but real flesh and blood
things four of which are lying on
slabs next door--

Abbey SLAMS her fist onto the table

ABBEY
How dare you-- my husband was lying
on those same goddamn slabs and you
still havent found his killer--

AUGUST
--WHAT You know goddamn well what
happened to Will--the case is closed

for Christs sakes-- a
ABBEY
No--No--you cant just file these
things away without getting to what
really happened There are more
unsolved murders and missing people
in Nome than any other city in Alaska--
three years of which have been under
your watch Whatever is happening
in this town is real is dangerous
and must be dealt with

August glares at her hard then pushes stop on the recorder
and stands up towering over her

AUGUST
As Sheriff of this town Im warning
you professionally As a citizen
and someone who grew up here Im
warning you personally Stop
Whatever governmental study youre
conducting whatever you and your
husband were after is bringing
nothing but bad things to a town
thats had enough Now if I decided
to press I could make you an
accessory to a multiple homicide I
dont want thatjust like I dont
want whatever youre doing to
continue So in fairness let this
be understoodyouve been warned

THE MORNING SUN RISES

above Nome blazing rays off the snow and ice and revealing
a SNOW OWL sitting on a tree branch -- its eyes boring right
into us

CUT TO
CUTSIDE ABBEYS OFFICE DRIVEWAY

Light snow falls as Abbey drives up to find Theresa talking
guietly to someone unexpected -- Dr Abel Campos She kills
the engine and gets out

e

ABBEY
Abel

CAMPOS
I heard what happened I wanted
to make sure you were OK

ABBEY
You came all the way up here

He opens his arms wide and gives her a warm hug At first
she resists and then relents while fighting back tears

ABBEY
(sighs)
You didnt have to Im fine

CAMPOS
You want to talk

She pulls away and digs in her purse

ABBEY
I cant--not now Theresa could you
transcribe this for me

She hands her the PORTABLE RECORDER and starts to head
inside

THERESA
(watches inspects
her)
Do you want me to cancel your schedule--

ABBEY
No-no-

THERESA
--Im sure theyll understand

CAMPOS
Abbey

She finally turns back around

CAMPOS
How you feeling

ABBEY
(lies)
Ready to get the day started

CAMPCS
A lots happened None of it good
You think maybe its time to take a
step back maybe consider a
sabbatical

She shakes

ABBEY
I love that word it doesnt sound
anything like what it actually means
which is time off

CAMPOS
Then call it a break

ABBEY
I did a lot of thinking a lot of
soul searching aboutwhat Im doing
here about myself Will

her head slowly

ABBEY
I would have never ever thought in
a million years that Tommy would
do what he did and wipe out his entire
existence

CAMPOS
--Abbey--

ABBEY
--Nor would I have thought that Id
be sitting here as a widow when less
than a month ago I was happily married
and raising two healthy children
one of which has now lost their sight
as a result of all this

CAMPOS
--you need to step awayfor
perspective--clarity on what happened
You cant continue--

ABBEY
--No Abel I can And have to
Thats the only thing thats still
possible within my power
Continuing Finding out whats caused
this I dont believe that what
happened to Will and what happened
to Tommy and his family are unrelated
I dont think that five people slain
in a little over three weeks can be
chalked up to simple coincidence--
especially in a town that has a
history of death and disappearance

Campos says nothing staring at the snow

CAMPOS
Then would you mind if I stayed on
for a bit

(MORE)

CAMPOS (CONTD
Kept an eye on you since you dont
seem too keen on doing so yourself

Abbey cant help the tears she embraces Campos He holds
her fast

IN ABBEYS OFFICE LATER
Abbey walks in to find Scott Stracinsky and his wife

CINDY ALIAS seated on the couch Scott is clearly
agitated having trouble sitting still

ABBEY
Good morning

ScoTT
Hey

CINDY

‘Morning doctor

Abbey sets her things down and then sits in the chair next
to them They are clearly tense Abbey does her best to
ease into things

ABBEY
Solots to talk about

Scott anxious chomping at the bit

SCOTT
(almost blurting out)
What happened to Tommy

ABBEY
To cant really discuss another
patients--

SCOTT
--Hes dead You should be able to
discuss everything

Abbey relents a bit
ABBEY
It was something--I believe--to do
with his sleeping habits
Cindy caresses Scotts shoulders He is inconsolable
CINDY
Were really worried obviously

Its the second suicide in a month

ABBEY
I understand

SCOTT
We want you to hypnotize me too We ‘
need to know if theres anything Im y)

not remembering I feel like--we
feel like--that the best thing to do
is to face it

ABBEY

If you want to undergo that it has
to be done very delicately

(beat then)
Is it alright if I have Dr Campos
come in to observe Hes a visiting
doctor that I trust and I think we
should have another pair of eyes and
ears in here

The couple look at each other and nod in agreement

ScoTT
Sure

skin is this-this-this beige color
like the color of an egg and theyve
got these gigantic heads that make
a point in the back

(pauses)
And their eyes Theyre black and
so huge--

He cups his hands together making a GIANT OVAL

Abbey is absolutely floored Campos slowly shakes his head

AWOLCWA
“Our creation Examine Ruin

ABBEY

Ruin Destroy Who

AWOLOWA
Its an incomplete translation--we
dont know for sure whats being
said

ABBEY
Whatever it saidsounds aggressive

CAMPOS
(cant process)
This isnt making sense

AWCLOWA
If this is authentic then its the
first ever verbalized recording of
the Sumerian language Were talking
about the oldest language in human
history--

up the tape recorder--

AWOLOWA
--with a key on how to speak it

ABBEY
But what was happening in my room
What was being done to me

AWOLOWA
Whats unsettlingis that whatever
it isits vocalsit doesnt
sound ordinary

ABBEY
You mean human

CAMPOS
Stop Stop Stop Lets not fuel
any more of these fires
(to Awolowa)
Theres any number of reasons for
the distortion in that voice

AWOLOWA
Im not jumping to conclusions but
her voice sounds fine

CAMPOS
The tape could have been recorded
over and part of the old recording
is still heard--

ABBEY
I dont recycle tapes

CAMPOS
Well maybe you did this time

AWOLOWA
That still doesnt explain why that
voice is speaking a language that
pre-dates Egyptian hieroglyphics

Campos cant respond

AWOLOWA
Ive researched the Sumerian
civilization for the last fifteen
years of my lifeand the things
Tve found in--in relation to this
issue--are intriguing

As Awolowa talks ARCHIVAL IMAGES flash across the screen --

AWOLOWA
You can go into any Sumerian exhibit
and see what Im about to tell you

launching into the sky

AWOLCWA (CONTD)
The Alien-God legend has its basis
its origins in Sumerian history

Astounded they look at Awolowa trying to process the flood
of information The phone is ringing but no one hears it

AWOLOWA
You can find everything Ive described
in a museum right now

CAMPOS
Bullshit

AWOLOWA
And youre entitled to that reaction
I stated from the beginning that I
would draw no conclusions I am giving
facts Proof from thousand of years
of data collection and research

Campos turns to Abbey

CAMPOS
Its one thing to entertain a wild
theory its quite another to invest
in it You honestly believe you
were forcibly taken from your bedroom
by members of an alien race

Abbey flummoxed frustrated The phone continues to ring
incessantly Abbey reaches over wearily picking up the
receiver

ABBEY

try and calm down Do you think
hes a threat to you or to himself

Shes quiet a moment then slowly starts to shake her head

THE REAL DR TYLER
I--I cant watch it

CLATUNDE
I just want to play--

THE REAL DR TYLER
Theres no reason for me to--I cant
relive it

OLATUNDE
I thought if you could walk us through
like you did with the audio recor-- and

THE REAL DR TYLER
I said no

An intelligible male voice is heard off camera Olatunde
looks towards the voice

OLATUNDE
I want the audience to be able to
experience it with her--so they know
what it was like--so they can feel
what she went through at the time
Is that--

The voice interrupts utters something unintelligible

OLATUNDE
(to voice)
Thats all We only do it once
(to Abbey)
Is that OK with you

The male voice speaks again and Dr Tyler turns her head
awkwardly to look at him and then back to Olatunde and nods

ABBEY

OK

Thank you

THREE DEPUTIES including DEPUTY RYAN ALIAS 32 bearded

August approaches her and launches an assault --

AUGUST

ABBEY
Hes para--

and it twisted his body--an-and thats
probably what did it It was--it

Shes at a loss for words

August is very still very rational -- but his eyes are firing
e into her like the bullets of an Ax-47

AUGUST
(quietly)
Something was inside of him It
twisted his body

It takes her a moment to answer--
ABBEY
(pained)
Yes

AUGUST
And you have proof of this

ABBEY
It didnt record its all distorted--

The rage drains from August
AUGUST
Abbeyhow the hell do you expect

me

and is replaced by sorrow

AUGUST

ABBEY

I know what I saw

AUGUST

I know you just lost Will and Im
sorry about Ashley--my heart goes
out to you-- it does But you have
to understand that what youre doing
is hurting people horribly Its
time you face the reality at hand
Know I dont want to do this but
youve forced us to this situation

August moves putting his hands on her

ABBEY
What

As he turns her around and begins to handcuff her

AUGUST
You have the right to remain silent

ABBEY
What are you doing

AUGUST
Anything you say or do can and will

The deputies move towards her

THE REAL DR TYLER (VO)
Its aits a shock every time--as
if Im seeing it for the first time

A ways down the road DEPUTY RYANS COP TRUCK makes a U-Turn
away from the other trucks and pulls off to the side of the
road facing Abbeys house

IN DEPUTY RYANS COP TRUCK

Deputy Ryan turns off his truck from here he can see her
entire house with ease He grabs his radio mic

RYAN
This is Ryan sir Im stationed in
front of the Tyler home

AUGUST (on radio)
Roger that youre out there all

Ryan sighs

AUGUST (on radio)
She so much as opens that front door

RYAN
Copy that sir

CUT TO

THE INTERVIEW ROOM

Abbeys eyes are bloodshot tears rimming the bottom cf each
eye Her cheeks are puffy and red

THE REAL DR TYLER
You see it in their eyes in their
mannerisms You can tell by what
theyre saying that something isnt
right

(MORE)

THE REAL DR TYLER (CONTD)

(pauses)
And then all of a sudden you realize
that the person sitting across from
you is insane

(breath)
I became that personto everyone
else--they thought--they think Im
insane And the thing ishow can
I blame them What Im saying is--
isI wish I had made it all up
Because at least that way I could
walk away--with all the things that
I lost--

(she grows more

emotional)
--and I could continue to live my
lifebut I cant

(quietly)
Causecause I didnt make up

Qlatunde nods understanding
FADE IN LEFT SPLITSCREEN UPPER and LOWER FRAME

THE REAL DR TYLER
Andthen uhCampos and Awolowa
were both questionedby August

LEFT LOWER FRAME August questions Awolowa who glares at
the Sheriff

LEFT UPPER FRAME August interrogates Campos towering over
him as he verbally attacks him

IN RIGHT FRAME

THE REAL DR TYLER
Campos reminded him about the
disappearances and--

OLATUNDE
What about them

THE REAL DR TYLER
Homicides missing people dozens of
them Its been going on here since
the 1960s and the FBI has been
dropping in from time to time

CLATUNDE
What did they find

THE REAL DR TYLER
Nothingits inconclusive To
this day nothings been sclved

OLATUNDE
You mentioned the situation dated
back some time 1960s thats forty
years

THE REAL DR TYLER
theres a lot of government
activity up hereI mean they had
a couple of Blue Book cases back
then too

Olatunde is writing all of this down

OLATUNDE
What do you think all this means
How do you put it in perspective

THE REAL DR TYLER
They have categories for these types
of things--different levels--

OLATUNDE
--Explain

THE REAL DR TYLER
An encounter of the First
Kindthats when you see a UFO
The Second Kind Its when you see
evidence of it crop circles--
radiationThird Kind is when you
see an alien But the Fourth
Kindtheres nothing more
frightening than the Fourthyou
see that ones when they abduct
you

She looks at Olatunde hard

THE REAL DR TYLER

I think its all part of the same
thing its all connectedto Will--
the missing people--to everything in
Nome

(her mouth twitches)
You seethis kind of thingwhats
happening to Nome--to me I think
its happening to cther pecplenot
just therebut all over the
worldin towns cities--most of
them dont even know it

OLATUNDE
Know theyre abducted

THE REAL DR TYLER
How could they know
(MORE)

THE REAL DR TYLER (CONTD)

How could they remember what theyre
being forced to forget Unless
they had help

(forceful)
And I tried to give that help to as
many people as I could--no matter
what they say about me--I tried and
maybe failed but I did try

This floats in the air a couple seconds

OLATUNDE
So what happened with the Sheriffs
interview of Campos and Awolowa

THE REAL DR TYLER
August told them to stay away from
me--and I told them to go back home--
so I wouldntdrag them into this
any further butthey--uh--they
told me they werent leaving until
they were sure I was alright But
that night just got worse

CUT TO BLACK
FADE IN
333 AM
ig the time on Deputy Ryans dashboard as he snores
And then he wakes up

For a moment he stares straight ahead and then he starts
looking around frantically as if he missed something but
theres nothing

He rubs his head and sets his head back against the headrest --
at that moment he sees it just under his rear view mirror
out the window and above Abbeys home

Her lips tighten a part of her unwilling to part with her

ABBEY

Abbeys eyes gradually openlooking hard at sgomething we

Abbey SLAMS HER BODY

back into the chair and goes rigid her face screwing up as
if something were pushing on her SMOTHERING her body with
an immeasurable amount of pressure

She exerts quick rapid breaths trying to breath Campos
watches her helplessly

CAMPOS

ABBEY
(clenched teeth)
-Taking me out-- up-- up--
(desperation)
God Im so high Im so-- its not
stopping-- its not safe--AHHHHHH

She lifts her back out of the chair then COLLAPSES back
into it as if whatever vehicle she thinks shes in stopped

Eyes closed her head is making jerky movements to the left
and right as if it took great effort to move it

CAMPOS
Keep talking to me-- keep talking--
what do you see

Her arms raise into the air and with the motor skills of
someone who appears drugged she seems to be swatting
something away Her face is contorted into a flesh mask of
fear

ABBEY
(silent tears)
What are you What are you doing
to me

CAMPOS
Who are you talking to

ABBEY

from her

ABBEY

Suddenly her body goes STIFF her head snaps back into the
headrest--her arms slam down and her

LEGS spread OPEN

face from view as she FLOPS WILDLY as if in a SEIZURE

THE INTERVIEW RCOM

Dr Tyler is speechless not breathing as her mouth twitches
uncontrollably Behind her the monitors are black

CLATUNDE
What the hell happened in that room

THE REAL DR TYLER
they cameand we were-- we
were

Now her whole face is twitching her left eye blinking with
every movement

THE REAL DR TYLER
They abducted us all of us-- but
eventually brought us back but we
dont remember where they took us--
even with hypnosis its black--

The twitch has become a tremble making it difficult for her
to form her words

OLATUNDE
Are you OK Do you need a break

THE REAL DR TYLER
No Im fine

Dr Tyler takes a couple of breaths steadying herself

OLATUNDE
Why wouldanother entity not from
this world do these things Help us
understand the reasoning behind it

THE REAL DR TYLER
God I dont know--how can we know
If humans can mystify other humans
on a daily basisthen--I--I think
we can conclude that something from
another worldcan mystify us as
well

The import of her statement hovers in the air

OLATUNDE
Youre voice--its voiceit said

Dr Tylers face twitches--dcesnt respond

OLATUNDE

She looks down at the tablenot wanting to say these next

THE REAL DR TYLER

about Will

CUT TO

IN A NOME HOSPITAL ROOM

Abbey sits in bedher back against the headboard her
hair stringy moist unkempt Shes lost too much
weightbone is pressing against her skinan empty shell
of a once strong healthy woman

Her body is very still unmoving
August sits in a chair next to her a MANILA FOLDER in hand

AUGUST
I hate to ask you these questions--
now while youre in this condition
your in--but this is one of those
things in life that cant wait

Abbey nods weakly quietly

AUGUST
Abbey What happened to your
daughter

ABBEY
(quietly weakly)
I told you
AUGUST
What you told me and what actually
happened are two different things

ABBEY
No--theyre the same

AUGUST
OKyou want to play this game

ABBEY
Its not a game--

AUGUST
How did Will die

She hesitates pulls back--stunned by the question

AUGUST
CimonAnswer it

ABBEY
He was murdered

AUGUST
No Abbey What youre telling me
and what happened are two different
things Now one more time How did
Will die

Her eyes are darting aroundshes breathing harderher
skin is losing its colorpanic is welling in her throat

ABBEY
Why are you asking me this

AUGUST
(yells)
Campos Get in here

A deputy opens the door and Campos walks in circles to the
other side of the bed and kneels next to Abbey

ABBEY
What is this

CAMPOS
Its OKIts CK

AUGUST
No its not OK Were getting to
the bottom of everything now Again
How did your husband die

ABBEY
I told you an intruder entered our
house and killed him

August and Campos exchange looks

CAMPOS

Hes going to show you something
that will upset you But it has to
be done understand

She doesnt understand With what strength she has left
she looks at Campos hard

August opens his fileand holds up
a PHOTO
for her to see

She gasps--half SCREAMS doesnt have the strength to scream
again--her face is a perfect mask of revulsion of
tearsanguish

ABBEY
why

THE PHOTO is of WILL TYLER--with a BLOODY HOLE in the side
of his head the size of a GRAPEFRUIT

AUGUST
This is the head of a man--

e He holds up a SECOND PHOTO this one of a 9mm PISTOL

AUGUST
--who used this gun to blow his own
brains out

Abbey cant stop sobbing--her eyes are closed her head turned
away--whimpering Campos is caressing her face almost
protecting it from the photos

CAMPOS
Im sorry

August shakes the photos for emphasis

AUGUST
This is how you do it--and he did it
right Suicide Abbey Thats how
your husband died

ABBEY
stop

AUGUST
He took a pistol and shot himself in
-— the head--there was no knife no
intruder--just him and his own gun
at the edge of your bed

ABBEY
--hes not that man--he wouldnt do
that to us to his family--

AUGUST
--Ive seen it before Ill see it
again--

ABBEY

(to Campos)
Tell himtell him hes wrong I
would have known he was gonna--Ima
psychiatrist---Christ----1 would
have known--

Campos holds her close trying to comfort her

CAMPOS
You cant blame yourself for what
was going on in his head Who knows
what he learned what he didnt
sharewhat finally broke him--

ABBEY
Nono
CAMPOS
Sometimes the closest signs the
ones closest to us are the hardest
to read
AUGUST
to Abbey)

Now you know the reality
August puts the photos downand leans in

AUGUST
And for the last time Tell me what
happened to Ashley

She cant answer

AUGUST
Tell me

CAMPOS
You have to tell himfor Ashley

Tears wetting her cheeks she pulls away from Campos and
looks at himsoftly

ABBEY
You know what happened You
experienced it Except we came
backshe didnt

Campos eyes lock on hersand then they give in looking
down to the bed He cant refute her wordsnot after what
hes seen Not after what theyve been through

ABBEY
(to August)
I swear to you--I swear it She was
taken by-by somethingsomething
not from here I swear it

August looks between the two of them his face like a bull
ready to charge--but unsure which bulls eye to hit first

AUGUST
(then quietly)
Its difficult to go back

He arranges the pictures and closes the files just so

CAMPOS
Go back

August takes his time doesnt rush it

AUGUST
Back over the line from fiction to
reality You cant just stop being
insane whenever you want to Its
the kind of thing that stays with

you forever

OLATUNDE
So Will committed suicide

the kind of thing one would not want to admitwould not
want to say out loudbut she does--

THE REAL DR TYLER
-yes

OLATUNDE
Your credibilityHow do you expect
me-- the audience-- to believe
anything you have to say after you
were hallucinating the murder of
your husband

THE REAL DR TYLER
a They werent hallucinations--I just
couldnt--it can be difficult to
(MORE)

THE REAL DR TYLER (CONTD)
face the truth and with Willi thats

how I dealt with it Andno matter
what you believe the recordings do

You can doubt my words--
you would doubt me even if I were a
saint I mean were talking about
things that--that arent normal--but
what you cannot doubt are the
recordings--t-the other people--their
stories name removed is dead
name removed back is broken-- a-
and Ashleyshes still gone These
are hard facts

OLATUNDE
They appear to be--

THE REAL DR TYLER
(twitches)
L THEY ARE You can
sit there and speculate but I have
to keep hope aliveI have to believe
in what were doing--this film--my
story--that it will help I have to
believe shes still alive somewhere
that shes safethat theres a
chance Im going to see her again--
hold her again--

(starts to cry)
--hear her voiceI--I just want my
little girl back Shes all I have
I cant bring back Will Ronnie he--
he--he--blames me for everything--he
shut me out of his life Mothers
shouldnt be alone We shouldnt be
without our children

(desperate)
I just want my baby backI just
want her back

Tears glisten off her cheeks as her face continues to twitch
but shes somehow holding it together somehow preventing
the complete emotional collapse youd expect

CLATUNDE
I think we can stcp here

The cameras slowly zcom out in farewelland for the first
time we see that Dr Tyler is in a WHEELCHAIR with ARMS and
LEGS so WITHERED away they dont look like theyve moved in
years

By Kate Ripple
Fairbanks Daily News

Nome Alaska The only susp-
€ct in the disappearance of 5 year
old Ashley ‘Tyler was ‘Yeleased fr-
Om Custody yesterday with all c-
harges dropped after spending 2
months under house arrest for her
daughters disappearance on the m-
orning of October f0

“Weve got nothin ig On her and
we haven’t found the girl” chief
‘Moiteés said Asked if he beliey-
ed Dr Tyler wasgiiilty he stopp-
éd short of saying she was innoce-’
nt “Theres 6 motive no evide-
‘nee aiid no girl On Paper there’s
NO reason she should have kidnap- °
ped her own daughter But she’s
not here and we have no idea w-
here the hell she is”

Reports speculate that Ashleys
disappearance could be Telated to
the hundreds of people who have
disappeared in the city which has
cases going back to 1960 and occ-
urring as recently as last month
Most of Nome’s missing person
cases have gone unsolved as have
most missing person cases throug-
hout Alaska due to the severity of
the land
