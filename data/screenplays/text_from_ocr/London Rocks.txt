in any confidence game bunko
flim-flam grift or hustle
everything the con man says is
said for a reason everything he
does is done for a purpose If you
think you’ve worked out the play
youre wrong The real play is
hidden deep inside the twists and
turns of the booster’s imagination
The confidence man exploits all
human qualities - dishonesty
honesty trust vanity compassion
irresponsibility naiveté but most
of all greed It’s greed that makes
the ‘mark’ walk into a dark tunnel
with his wallet wide open

INT THE CHATEAU DE VERSAILLES - FRANCE 1792 - NIGHT

The dim burn of flickering wall LANTERNS warm a maze of
shadowy stone corridors The night calm is broken by a
maddening frenzy deep in the chateau - a disaster has been
alerted SERFS and MAIDS dressed in nightclothes panic and
scurry in all directions A LIGHT can be seen moving along
the far distance of the corridors Getting closer it
brightens the darkest crevices - a light befitting a king

In his bedclothes LOUIS XVI emerges from the darkness
followed by SERVANTS holding many lanterns aloft His walk is
urgent - his face is thunder His urgency fills the camera as
he passes and bellows
LOUIS XVI

OU est-elle
EXT THE CHATEAU DE VERSAILLES - COURTYARD - NIGHT
An unknown cloaked WOMAN on HORSEBACK The horse bucks high
on hind legs then races off hard under the portcullis and
into the night darkness As the horse gallops away

jolt of the car he loses balance and bumps the guy from
behind knocking him into Simone - she yelps

everything’s there The train doors open Dacey smiles

DACEY
Nice - giving blood

Dacey jumps off the train leaving the guy puzzled

INT PICCADILLY CIRCUS STATION - DAY

Simone leaps from the train and runs through the crowded
platform She catches up to Dacey and spins him around

SIMONE
Why did you do that

DACEY
(sotto voce)
Because - I could’ve lifted that
wallet wearing a boxing glove and
the dude only had a fifty We don’t
hit ordinary people - you’ve gotta
know your ‘marks’ better than that

SIMONE
You called him
DACEY
And you should’ve shaken it off
Over there

Further along the platform a PROFESSOR TYPE puts his ticket
into a POCKETBOOK that is stuffed full of POUND NOTES

If I’m not going to be a
pickpocket then why am I doing it

DACEY
Baby steps - you gotta learn the
basics from the bottom up

TWO ARMED COPS descend the down escalator Dacey senses
Simone’s nervousness he smiles and acknowledges the cops as
they pass

SIMONE
Friends of yours

DACEY
Never look away it makes you look
guilty Look them in the eyes -
like you’ve got nothing to hide

Dacey walks Simone off the escalator - they pass a BUSKER
playing the saxophone Dacey stops fishes in his pocket and
tosses a TEN POUND NOTE into the BUSKER’S HAT

EXT GREAT WINDMILL STREET - DAY

Dacey exits the station grabs a newspaper from a VENDOR and

walks along the street Simone skips out of the station a few
paces behind playfully slaps Dacey’s ass and runs off Dacey
gives chase - hand-in-hand they walk along together

Crossing the entrance to BREWER STREET PARKING STRUCTURE
they allow a PORSCHE 911 to pass Dacey admires the PRETTY
WOMAN driver - Simone whacks him for looking
911 passes a BMW is revealed parked across the street -
OBSTERS sit inside - waiting Seeing Dacey one of the
ters gets out of the car Quick as a flash Dacey pushes
Simone into the parking structure stairwell The mobster
crosses the street and follows them into the stairwell The
other mobster pulls the BMW into the parking structure and
slowly circles the floors

INT PARKING STRUCTURESTAIRWELL - DAY
Dacey and Simone urgently climb the stairs

SIMONE
Where are we going

DACEY
Picking up the car

Dacey looks through the small glass window of the 1 level
door - then pushes the door open

INT PARKING STRUCTURE1ST FLOOR - DAY
-almost bumping into the pretty 911 driver

DACEY
Oh Jesus I’m sorry

The 911 driver steadies herself brushes herself down smiles
flirtatiously at Dacey and walks on Simone gives the 911
driver a dirty look - then calls after Dacey

SIMONE
Do we have a car

DACEY
We do now

Dacey tosses the KEYS he’s just LIFTED from the 911 driver
into the air and turns to Simone

DACEY
(teasing)
And that is how you do it - c’mon
let’s get out of here

They scamper to the 911 - Simone clambers into the passenger
seat Dacey climbs behind the wheel and starts the engine He
sees the BMW heading towards them

DACEY
Shit
forces Simone’s head down into his lap - then ducks
imself Simone struggles - she pops her head up just as
BMW passes

SIMONE
I’m not doing that here

The mobster sees her - red brake lights burst on Realizing
theyve been made Dacey slams the 911 into first and
screeches out of the parking space The BMW hits reverse and
the chase is on Dacey heads for the down ramp - no good a
CAR from the lower level is coming up blocking the route -
Dacey hits the up ramp The mobster from the stairwell jumps
into the BMW and it sets off after the 911 Up a level and
another and another Tires burning rubber screeching The
BMW tight on the 911 tail - bumper shoving bumper Top floor -
trapped ‘What now’ Last gasp the down ramp appears Dacey
makes the turn The BMW doesn’t have the lock - quick
reverse it makes the turn and in chase again Down a level
dodging cars dodging people Faster and faster - being
shunted from behind by the BMW

Crap Small child - middle of the floor Quick turn hit the
next down ramp missing the kid by inches The BMW does the
same Hot in pursuit - more hard bumps from the BMW Simone

is panicked One mobster has a gun - he leans out of the
window and takes aim Hard right turn - hitting the next down
ramp - the mobster nearly thrown out of car Another car
coming down - Dacey cuts across it and makes the ramp The on-
coming car gets between the down ramp and the BMW - holding
them up giving Dacey a break

Ground floor exit barrier The 911 pulls to a sharp halt
Dacey feels in his pockets then frantically searches the
ashtray cup holders the side pockets for some cash -
nothing The lot ATTENDANT gives a look Dacey turns to
Simone

DACEY
I gave mine to the horn player
SIMONE
(snippy )
I had a fifty Oh no - you gave

it back

Dacey pulls a face at Simone The BMW appears in the rearview
mirror

DACEY
(to attendant)
Sorry pal

Hard first gear and crash - through the barrier
ONDON STREETS - DAY

Acar chase through tight narrow London streets The BMW
smashes its way toward the 911 Around BERKLEY SQUARE out
into PARK LANE - racing chasing manic driving Through HYDE
PARK the 911 missing the gates - just The BMW sideswiping
them - big dent Into THE MALL past BUCKINGHAM PALACE The
BMW never quite getting the make on 911 Bam The 911 hits a
hot dog stall sending it high into the air The stall and
its contents splatter all over the BMW KENSINGTON HIGH
STREET through red lights just missing a car Behind a
LONDON BUS The 911 tries to dodge around it - can’t get by
Ducking in and out avoiding oncoming TRAFFIC The BMW right
there now along side Simone looks over

SIMONE
Dacey

Dacey looks - again the mobster aims a gun No time to wait
Foot down around the bus bouncing off ONCOMING - causing
mayhem The BMW mounts the sidewalk and overtakes the bus on
the inside - fucking illegal Driving along the sidewalk
dodging pedestrians the BMW pulls level with the 911
flashing past lamp posts - trees - pillar boxes - lamp posts
trees - crossings Suddenly the BMW is faced with a BARRIER
Hand-brake turn - out onto the road the chase is on again

Through more London streets and landmarks The WATER COMPANY
repairing a leak - road soaked The 911 races through a giant
puddle throwing up a cloud of water and drenching TWO PARKING
ATTENDANTS The BMW does the same Still racing until - THE
FAMOUS BEATLES CROSSING ABBEY ROAD A line of school
children crosses ala - Paul John George and Ringo Dacey
stops The BMW slowly rolls up beside the 911 That’s it all
over - caught no place to run The mobsters have to wait for
the kids to clear before making their move A TRUCK
delivering a PIANO to ABBEY STUDIO’S moves off revealing a
COP CAR on the other side of the road Dacey smiles - the
mobsters are pissed Crossing clear Dacey politely waves
‘after you’ Reluctantly with the cops so close by the BMW
slowly pulls away Dacey watches the cops TURN LEFT in his
rearview spins a 360 and races off away The BMW does the
same and the chase on again

More high-speed streets - then HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE Road
works - room for only one car They race Wholl make the
gap Pedals to the floor squeezing each other’s road space
the 911 bounces off of the BMW Suddenly Dacey slams on his
brakes confusing the BMW driver The driver looks back at
Dacey - bewildered As the driver turns back he realizes his
BMW is heading for an unseen mound of tarmac The car runs up
the tarmac like a ramp launching the BMW into the air up
and over the side of the bridge and CRASH into the RIVER
THAMES A crowd gathers watching the BMW slowly sink The
mobsters get out of the car and flounder in the water Dacey
puts the 911 into first gear and slowly drives away

them onto the bed and then attacks another drawer Two
watches and a lighter hit the bed Dacey picks up a vase
checks for a makers mark and tosses it onto the bed He
looks at Simone - ‘well’

An eleven hundred lousy euros

CHARLIE
Simone did he ever tell you about
the first time I met him

DACEY
I was 2 years old

Simone shakes her head - Dacey’s heard the story a million
times before - he signs

CHARLIE
He was two years old
(at Dacey)

It was the day they took your dad
off to Statesville penitentiary
(to Simone)
His mom sat him on my knee and said
Charlie take care of Dacey while
I say goodbye to my husband
(at Dacey)
I had to change your diaper Youve
always been full of crap Pounds

SIMONE
Well take it

CHARLIE
Got anything else

Dacey stares at Simone She ignores the stare - he stares
harder With an indignant sigh Simone reaches into her purse
snatches out a small trinket box and slams it on the table
Charlie opens the box and pulls out the GOLD LOUIS XV BROACH
that was being crafted in the opening sequence

CHARLIE
What have we here
DACEY
Is it worth anything
SIMONE
We’re not selling it
(pouts )
We’re pawning it it’s been in my

family forever
Charlie gives Dacey a look - ‘heathen’

CHARLIE
Are you French

SIMONE
American - Louisiana

DACEY
Uh hello Family name Rousseau
You might want to think there’s a
little frog in there somewhere

CHARLIE
Louisiana named after Louis XIV
The French owned it colonized it
and governed it

DACEY
(sarcastic)
Wow Did I skip class that day How
much is it worth Charlie

CHARLIE
Thomas Jefferson brought Louisiana
back in 1804 for the Americans

DACEY
Charlie - value the pin

Charlie looks at the pin through his glass

CHARLIE
French broach late 1700s Louis
XVI - two grand

DACEY

one hundred We’1l take cash

Charlie scurries off to the back of his store

DACEY
Don’t tell me it’s fake

CHARLIE
(calls)
Give me a minute

DACEY

(calls)
Hope you’re getting the cash back
there Charlie

CHARLIE

(calls)
Back in France in the eighteen
century the world was introduced to
enlightenment

DACEY
Enlightenment - yeah that’s cool

Charlie returns with an armful of rolled up maps He unfolds
and discards several maps until he finds the MAP from the
opening sequence Charlie lays the map flat in the desk

CHARLIE
Enlightenment led to the French
revolution John Rocque was the
best cartographer of the time this
is his map of London - take a look

and Simone look but fail to share Charlie’s excitement

DACEY
What we looking at

Charlie pulls a huge arm mounted magnifying glass over the
map and holds the brooch under the glass

CU Of the magnified brooch Charlie twists the brooch 180
degrees revealing its pattern is a mini version of the map

SIMONE
It’s the same

CHARLIE
Not quite look

Charlie points to a small diamond in the broach’s center
CHARLIE

There’s a small diamond and
inscription Les le roi diamants

SIMONE
The king’s diamonds
Charlie smiles - “Yes”
CHARLIE
And these three fléches
DACEY
Fleches
SIMONE
Arrows

Around the edge of the pin are three strategically placed
arrows - each has an engraving next to it

CHARLIE
Trois cent Deux cent Cent et
cinquante

SIMONE
Three hundred Two hundred One
hundred and fifty

DACEY
So we got ourselves a copy of
Londons primo mapmaker’s map on
our pin What’s up with that Not
exactly the Da Vinci code is it

CHARLIE
This may be the Du Barry broach

DACEY
(interested)
And that’s good right

Charlie holds the broach aloft - Dacey takes it

CHARLIE
Madamme Du Barry was cortisan to
King Louis XV A low class
prostitute elevated to the court so
the king could have sex with her

DACEY
An eighteenth century pole dancer -
it’s in the genes

Simone sneers and takes the broach from Dacey

CHARLIE
Du Barry was a woman scorned When
the king died she was exiled from
the Royal Court And In 1792 during
the revolution when the French
Crown Jewels were stolen many
believe Du Barry was responsible

SIMONE
The King’s diamonds

CHARLIE
(smiles - yes)
Du Barry made several trips to
London - it’s thought to hide the
jewels It’s long been rumored that
she had a broach made revealing
the diamonds hiding place

DACEY
Shut up

Charlie’s face is serious

DACEY
So where’s it say the jewels are

Charlie sets out another newer map of London and marries it
to the older one

CHARLIE
Lets see trois cent Deux
cent and one hundred and fifty

Charlie puts a pin in the map at the cross points

Alex laughs to himself and walks out

DACEY
Yeah nice one Steve McQueen

DRISCOLL
How deep’s the tunnel you’d be
after Because you’ll need to be
below the services - electricity
gas water That’ll give you enough
ceiling to support the ground
weight But-cha big problem is the
tube Youve already got bloody
great tunnels running under half of
the city You won’t be getting many
fellas willing to dig with the
chance of the 530 from Cockfosters
slamming right up their arse

Dacey looks at Charlie

DACEY
I didn’t understand a word he said

CHARLIE
London underground trains Dacey -
they run under Trafalgar square

Dacey nods - he understands now

DACEY
Can you hit the diamonds

DRISCOLL
I could hit ya’ a matchbook if you
tell me the depth it’s buried
and give me right money

DACEY
How much is the right money

Driscoll strokes his chin grabs a pen from Dacey’s table and
scrawls a number on a piece of paper Dacey looks at the
number - his eyes pop and he swallows hard

DRISCOLL
For that I’11 build you a tunnel
thatll last a couple of decades

DACEY
How about a tunnel that’1ll last a
couple of days

DRISCOLL

COROZZO

DACEY
Would I come back without a good
reason for you to keep me alive

Corozzo smiles - ‘true’

COROZZO
The type of money you ask - would
buy me three good paintings

DACEY

Corozzo chuckles and then walks away

Dacey is desperate - he calls after Corozzo

DACEY
The Hope diamond is worth three
quarters of a billion There’s

missing - you get half

Corozzo stops He doesn’t look back but smiles at his
daughter GINA 32 stunningly attractive watching from the
far side of the garden Dacey and Gina exchange charged looks
- much is unsaid between them and Dacey clearly still has
feelings for her Dacey calls to Corozzo again

DACEY
I’ve gotta lot of paydays to make
this happen and I want up-front
guarantees for my team’s families

COROZZO
And what guarantees do you give me

Nothing from Dacey

COROZZO
No I thought not Maybe my
daughter should decide - she is
keen to come into this business

Dacey snaps a worried look towards Gina - her eyes are

suddenly full of venom - yet there’s honey in her lips -
pretty scary
