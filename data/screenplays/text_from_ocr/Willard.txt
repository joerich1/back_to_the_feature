Rats in the Basement

INT BASEMENT - WILLARDS HOUSE - NIGHT

In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east
coast cellar the audience sits amongst
SILENCE Then Rising from the THEATRES
REAR SPEAKERSfaint tiny claws many moving
as one scuttle seemingly in the roof of the
THEATRE CHEWING SCRATCHING TEARING

An elderly woman shrill and startling calls

dark
MRS STILES
Willard
(beat)
There are rats in the
basement

The scuttling stops Silence Beat another
thena metal doorknob distinctive to a
classic antiquated house CLACKS and echoes
OS A door slowly squeaks open

From an upstairs room a rhomboidal patch of
light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME
Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of
an average sized man at the summit of a flight
of stairs descending into a cold dark
cellar
OS a light switch FLIPS A FLASH An
exaggerated POP The light bulb blows in the
fg a fuse-box CRACKLES sprays tiny blue
sparks then returns to darkness

The shadow FLIPS the light switch with anxious
futility The basement remains dark

The shadow SIGHS shrinks before the man
DESCENDS an OS set of stairs the risers bare
The aged wood creaks Eerie as Arriving at a
landing he enters frame Remaining in
silhouette yet backlit by the light spilling
into the cellar from the upper room Although
face obscured by darkness his posture
reflects a dread as he continues down the
stairs

Upon reaching the cement floor CAMERA CREEPS
BACK The light is dim yet enough to reveal a
fuse-box beside wooden storage shelves lining
the walls With a hand against the stone wall
as a guide in the darkness the figure moves
to the fuse-box

Opening the fuse-box door releases residual
snaking blue smoke He twists the fuses taps
on them Nothing Closing the fuse-box he
notices the wires have been chewed

With cautious loathing the man blindly
continues to the shelves and rummages through
the supplies

His hands find a shoe box labeled FUSES and
begins sliding it off the shelf Untilhe

petrifies CAMERA SWEEPS into the shoebox lid
REVEALING half a dozen tapered rat droppings
Aghast the figure quickly pulls his hands
away trembling in the gray light He holds
Still shaking the hands quickly remove a
toilet plunger from a shelf CAMERA FOLLOWS
the improvised weapon as it RISES several
shelves Chewed holes replace the Quakers
eyes on a tube of oatmeal giving the
pilgrims smile the appearance of a madman
The toilet plunger pokes around discovering
chewed holes in boxes of Jello and Jiffy-Pop
Even candles and canned food have been gnawed
Tense the plunger pulls away knocking items
off the shelf A reflective glint rolls INTO
FRAME The bulb end of a cheap flashlight is
grabbed by the man and hurriedly lit

As the small light flaresSCUTTLING The man
spins toward the SOUND

IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM

several rat tails dashing through a hole ina

mother can read as reassuring however hes
enjoying lying to her
WILLARD
There are no rats

Willard moves to her with sincerity and
warmth carefully removing the pillows behind

purchase orders
MR MARTIN
That means My sales

floor inventory shipping
EVERYTHING comes to a dead
stop Because you allowed
purchase orders to
bottleneck on your desk
Willard appears driven to the brink of tears
He would never let them fall in front of Mr
Martin He takes his beating
Martin studies him yet looks through Willard
Then with a sadistic passive-aggressive
transition moves to the desk and sits before
Willard assuming a friend of the family tone
MR MARTIN

Willard For your job For
your fellow employees
Making matters worse Willards fellow
employees begin leaning out the office door to

MR MARTIN
Buyers feel a sense of
security when they see
proof that theyre dealing

that Mercedes AMG Class
theyll buy from us over
some slob with a Jaguar S-
Type
Slightly hyper-ventilating Willard tugs at

MR MARTIN
And do you know how Im

Because I get the job done
Because I never made my
boss carry a temp for eight
weeks

I made it because I never
caused my boss such grief

Youll never even own a
