EXT BOARDWALK AMUSEMENT PARK BOTTLE TOSS BOOTH NIGHT
It’s 1986

A colorful vibrant energy Pedestrians walk along the
boardwalk past game booths and souvenir stands as a ROLLER
COASTER SCREAMS by overhead

ADELAIDE (9 African American) wears a “Hands Across America”
T-shirt and her hair up in pigtails She holds a candied
apple and watches her father RUSSELL (33 African
American) hurl a baseball and TOPPLES a pyramid of bottles at
a “Bottle-Pyramid” booth He’s clearly in a bad mood and
takes it out on the bottles

RAYNE Adelaide’s mother (30 African American) CLAPS
obligatorily

The booth attendant DANNY a stoner feigns excitement
Judging by their physical energies Rayne and Russell had a
huge fight earlier Russell picks up a beer

DANNY
Great shot You put some heat on
that

RUSSELL
Thanks I guess I missed my chance
to go pro

DANNY
You can get a prize from the second
level or keep goin’ for a prize
from the third level

RUSSELL
What you think Addy Should we
stop or keep goin’

Adelaide looks at Rayne
RAYNE
Don’t look at me it’s your
birthday
Adelaide points to a T-shirt

ADELAIDE
I want that one

RUSSELL
Yeah alright That one

Russell takes the shirt then takes Adelaide’s candied apple
and hands it to Rayne

RUSSELL (CONT’D)
Here

Moments later

EXT BOARDWALK AMUSEMENT PARK MAIN STRIP NIGHT

Adelaide lags behind Rayne and Russell as they stroll down
the strip She wears a new oversized “Michael Jacksons
Thriller” t-shirt

RAYNE
(To Russell)
That shirt better not give her
nightmares

RUSSELL
In trouble for buyin’ my daughter a
shirt That’s a new one

RAYNE
She got scared when it was on TV
Youd know that if you were around

RUSSELL
Who let her watch it

ADELAIDE
I wasn’t scared

RAYNE
You hid your eyes when the people
came out the ground

ADELAIDE
No

RUSSELL
(To Rayne)
I need another beer

Adelaide turns her head and sees a drunk sailor TED spill
his drink on his white uniform

RAYNE
Mmmm Hmmm

RUSSELL
I can’t have a beer now

RAYNE
You can do whatever you want

RUSSELL
Okay then

The ROLLERCOASTER RUMBLES BY again Adelaide watches it The
screams startle her a little

RUSSELL (CONTD)
What about The Dipper Hey Addy
you wanna try it

RAYNE
You know she’s not big enough and
I sure as Hell am not going on that
thing

They pass a table where two teenagers MANDY and DOWNEY eat
fast food like pigs

Moments later Adelaide Rayne and Russell arrive at the
Whac-A-Mole booth

EXT BOARDWALK AMUSEMENT PARK WHAC-A-MOLE NIGHT

RUSSELL
‘Whac-A-Mole’ This is my game
(To the booth attendant TROY)
How many tickets four

TROY

Russell slams four tickets down grabs the tethered mallet
and starts playing

RAYNE
Addy come to the bathroom

ADELAIDE
I don’t have to go

RAYNE
Russ will you watch your daughter
please

RUSSELL

I’m watching

He’s not He’s playing Whac-A-Mole Rayne heads off Adelaide
watches Russell for a moment before her attention turns to
the ocean She walks towards the edge of the boardwalk A
young homeless man YOUNG FERDIE lurks by the wooden
staircase leading to the beach He’s clutching a cardboard
sign with a bible verse scrawled across it “Jeremiah 1111”
is written boldly and Young Adelaide stares at the numbers
as she passes him He looks right at her

Two teens GLEN and NANCY flirtatiously play “Rock Paper
Scissors” They keep landing on the same combination over and
over

GLEN
Oh my god

NANCY
That’s impossible

They do it again They land on scissors

GLEN
What the hell

NANCY
How are you doing that

GLEN
I’m not doing anything You are
EXT BEACH NEAR THE BOARDWALK NIGHT

Adelaide walks down the stairs and onto the beach where a
few teenagers act wild by a small campfire

Adelaide passes by the teenagers as she walks towards the
water’s edge

EXT BEACH NEAR THE WATER NIGHT

Moments later

She approaches the shoreline and scans the dark horizon In
the distance a large cloud erupts in silent lightning After
a breath she turns back towards the boardwalk

One attraction faces her on the beach level underneath the
boardwalk It’s called “SHAMAN’S VISION QUEST” a Native
American mystical themed funhouse with an entrance that faces
the water The facade is painted to resemble a forest with
colorful images of spirit-animals and a large Shaman who
glares pointing his finger directly at Adelaide Signs near
the arched doorway read “GET LOST” and “FIND YOURSELF”
INTEXT VISION QUEST PORTAL - NIGHT

Adelaide walks toward the Vision Quest portal

EXT BEACH NEAR THE BOARDWALK NIGHT

She drops the candied apple which falls onto the sand As
Adelaide gets near the entrance a THUP or two of thick rain
drops hit the sand The crowd over at the boardwalk MURMUR

INTEXT VISION QUEST PORTAL - NIGHT

Adelaide enters just as the rain hits full on

INT VISION QUEST FOREST ROOM NIGHT

Adelaide enters The Vision Quest and goes down a hallway
made to feel like a magical walk through a dark forest

The walls are dressed and painted like woods with the
occasional eerily pleasant deer rabbits and eagles A
CACOPHONOUS RECORDING OF NATURE SOUNDS plays over hidden
speakers

A cast-plastic owl on a branch pounces out from a dark
crevice startling Adelaide with a “HOO HOO” The owl emits a
HISS OF PRESSURIZED AIR and returns to its starting point

Adelaide calms herself and continues into the maze

INT VISION QUEST HALL OF MIRRORS NIGHT

Adelaide enters a room that’s still forest themed but also
covered in mirrors She walks past several distorted
reflections A short one a weird one and a weirder one

With a RUMBLE OF LIGHTNING the lights go out and the FOREST
NOISE STOPS What was kinda eerie when lit becomes downright
terrifying when dark

The only light comes from the glowing red exit sign She
walks towards it but hits a mirror She looks up The “EXIT”
sign appears forwards and backwards over and over again in
infinite reflections Adelaide reaches her hands out and
tries to make her way down the mirrored wall

She begins whistling “ITSY BITSY SPIDER” again to make her
feel at ease but she stops in near panic when a WHISTLE from
the halls overtakes hers Somebody somewhere in the mirrored
labyrinth is whistling in an attempt to emulate her tune

Something her size SCURRIES QUICKLY across the hallway
Adelaide backs up almost against a mirror She slowly begins
to turn 180 degrees to face the mirror behind her but HER
REFLECTION DOESN’T TURN This isn’t a mirror its the back
of another identical girl’s head

finger in front of his mouth like “Shhhhh” Adelaide knows
where this is going They look at the kids asleep in the

EXT BAYSIDE DAY

Adelaide Zora and Jason stand on the dock by their house
Gabe a pillar of pride stands triumphantly at the steering
wheel of a small motor boat that buzzes around in circles He
beams while Adelaide Zora and Jason remain thoroughly
unimpressed

Well What’dya think “Craw-
Daddy”
ADELAIDE
(unimpressed)

Wow

It’s got a cassette player and
everything All it needs is a new
coat of paint

They just watch him He holds up a life preserver

GABE (CONTD)
Hey “J” look It even came with
one of these

The boat engine SPUTTERS TO A HALT Smoke bellows from it

ZORA
(to Adelaide)
He’s kidding right

ADELAIDE
(under her breath)
He’s not kidding

GABE
Hold up He told me how to fix
this

Gabe goes to the back of the boat and pounds it with his fist
a couple times

GABE (CONTD)
Don’t worry I got it real cheap

ADELAIDE
I would hope so

GABE
She veers a little to the left so
you have to stay on it but other
than that it’s perfect

ADELAIDE
You think

GABE
Also Josh got a boat so we can do
a dual-family voyage

Ah I see

Zora are amused

INT WILSON’S CAR DAY

trees The rest of the family chills in their seats Jason
snaps in the back Zora reads Adelaide checks in on Gabe’s
mood

ZORA
Did you know this country produces
like twice as much waste per capita
as any other country in the
developed world

No one responds Jason looks at her dryly
ZORA (CONTD)
I forgot No one cares about the
environment
ADELAIDE
Since when did you become such a

tree hugger

ZORA
I’m not a tree hugger

ADELAIDE
I like it I’m just saying

Zora watches Jason continue to snap

ZORA
-Maybe you could just tell us
what’s supposed to happen and we
can picture it

He keeps snapping

ZORA (CONTD)
I mean at a certain point--

JASON
--Kiss my anus Zora

GABE
Oh

ADELAIDE
What

Zora is shocked and Adelaide tries to hide her smile

GABE
Why are we even talkin’ bout
“anuses”

JASON
“Anus” isn’t a curse word

ADELAIDE
That doesn’t matter

ZORA
Disgusting

GABE
See I wouldve preferred a curse
word in this case

JASON
(To Adelaide)
I can see you laughing in the
mirror

Gabe leans on the horn

GABE
OK you know what We don’t always
need to be talking There are
families that enjoy silence

The rest of them look around “yeesh” Adelaide knows her
family She turns on the radio “I Got Five On It” by Luniz
is on Gabe’s mood immediately lifts

GABE (CONTD)
“I got Five on it”

He grooves in his seat Zora and Jason share a look

JASON
What does “I got five on it” mean

ZORA
It’s about drugs

A cop waves the car past Jason watches the man

EXT BEACH BY THE BOARDWALK DAY

The Wilsons having parked step onto the sand carrying
folding chairs and other beach gear As they walk Adelaide
fights the urge to look behind her Eventually she steals a
nonchalant glance back in the direction of where the ‘Vision
Quest’ was when she was a child The attraction is still
there but it’s name has been changed to ‘Merlin’s Forest’
It still has the same “FIND YOURSELF” sign but the Shaman
has been replaced with an old white wizard who still points
his finger outwards like a bizarro Uncle Sam

JASON
Was that guy dead

ADELAIDE
Who

JASON

The guy in the ambulance

ADELAIDE
Ambulance means he’s alive right

Jason unsure nods and starts snapping again

a long way Not that you need it

Adelaide quietly doesn’t accept the compliment She
around the beach

KITTY (CONTD)

annoying

Adelaide almost says something but doesn’t

KITTY (CONTD)

ADELAIDE
Nothing

KITTY

Sometimes I have a hard time
talking

KITTY

You ever wonder “what if What if

LINDSEY

Jason tries to fly the kite Lyndsey cartwheels over to Zora
who reads on the beach

BECCA
Your brother’s so weird

ZORA
He just has a problem focusing

They look over at Jason who tries to fly the kite while
watching his own hand snap

BECCA
Are you going in the water

ZORA

Why not

Jason gets up and walks away from the water

Jason passes by them as he heads towards the Port-O-Potties

EXT BEACH PORT-O-POTTY - DAY

Jason takes a long walk past sunbathers and other people to
the port-o-potty near the boardwalk becoming increasingly
remote from the group When he arrives at the port-o-potty a
sour older lady emerges He lets her pass and then goes
inside

EXT BEACH PICNIC - DAY

ADELAIDE
There was this one competition
where I did a piece from “The

KITTY
(To Josh)

(To Adelaide)
You were saying

ADELAIDE
The ‘Grand Pas’ is supposed to be a
dance for two but I turned it into
a solo

KITTY

ADELAIDE
Nerve-racking I thought I’d get
disqualified but when I finished
the audience went crazy I won
first prize It was the best moment
of my lifebesides Zora and
Jasons birth

KITTY
The girls don’t make my top ten by
the way I’m convinced I would be a
movie star if I didn’t have them at
exactly the wrong time

Adelaide starts watching people on the beach around them as
Kitty drones on A guy chases his girlfriend who screams A
small group of people laugh hard A teen play fights with his
brother Each vignette seems to make Adelaide increasingly
nervous but she hides it well

KITTY (CONTD)
-I trained at Stella Adler and
booked two commercials before I met
Josh and totally stopped
auditioning when I got preggers
Then the move to San Fransisco was
like a fucking career killer The
whole thing was supposed to be I
would fly out for auditions but
that never happened I put myself
on tape for like half a year but
it’s really not the same You have
to be in the room for things to
fall into place

A red frisbee falls onto the towel they’re sitting on
Adelaide is startled

KITTY (CONT’D)
Jesus
(To Adelaide)
Oh look

Adelaide looks down The frisbee has landed perfectly on one
of the towel’s large printed polka dots Adelaide picks it

up revealing the same colored dot underneath It really is

eerily perfect Adelaide is quietly concerned

KITTY (CONTD)
Whoa That’s crazy We’ve been
having so many weird coincidences
happening lately

A guy runs over to claim the frisbee Adelaide gives it to
him

GUY
Thanks

He leaves Adelaide looks over and sees the twins playing
near Zora No Jason

KITTY
No “I’m sorry” Dick Anyway we
should go back to our place I
think it’s ‘vodka ‘o clock’

Jason comes out of the port-o-potty and starts walking back
to the beach but stops when he notices something strange A
man stands facing away from him on the beach about twenty
yards away The man has his arms stretched out at his sides
in a relaxed manner like a yoga pose Other people walk
around him only occasionally noticing him Jason is
transfixed He walks slowly and wide around the man trying to
see his face It’s tense

INT WILSON BAYSIDE HOUSE FOYER NIGHT
Adelaide Gabe and Jason stand out the front door window

Four people stand near the edge of the property silhouetted
by the moonlight Their contour seem to fit the same familial
archetypes as the Wilsons themselves On the left a boy
hunched and wavering Next to him a father hulking with
head tilted oddly Next a mother still and poised On the
right a daughter thin and sleek

Adelaide watches in horror

GABE ADELAIDE

GABE (CONTD)

goes)

response from the strangers tells him something might in fact
be very wrong

expected that to go

All of a sudden with a quick and coordinated dart the “BAD
FAMILY” break formation Gabe shudders The “BAD DAUGHTER”
goes left and the “BAD SON” gets on all fours and scurries
right Gabe falls back instinctively as the “BAD FATHER”
comes directly towards him

backing out of the room terrified as Adelaide comes and grabs
her

INT WILSON BAYSIDE HOUSE KITCHEN BREAKFAST TABLE NIGHT

Jason looks at a nearby window He gets closer to the glass
and tries to peek out

Suddenly the “Bad Sons” head pops up close He wears a
rubber burn mask

Adelaide rushes in with Zora and pulls Jason close

A SHARP WHISTLE cuts through the silence That familiar tune
“Itsy Bitsy Spider” terrorizes Adelaide

It’s her The “BAD MOTHER” walks slowly past the windows
towards the front door

A few FOOTSTEPS THUMP on the roof

EXT WILSONS BAYSIDE HOUSE FRONT LAWN NIGHT

We still can’t see their faces but the “Bad Mother” arrives
at the front door The “Bad Father” stops BANGING THE DOOR
She lifts a rock near the front steps

INT WILSONS BAYSIDE HOUSE FOYERLIVING ROOM NIGHT

Gabe takes a few deep breaths while the family huddles behind
him in the living room

Suddenly from outside a KEY GOES IN THE LOCK

ADELAIDE
The key
GABE
What key
ADELAIDE
The damn “Hide-a-key”
GABE
Hide-a-key” What kind of white-

shit

The door opens with force Gabe tries to hold it shut but
the Bad Father opens it anyway He swings at the “Bad Father”
who catches the bat and takes it away as if Gabe were a
child He brings the bat down on Gabe’s knee with a CRACK
Gabe goes down

GABE (CONTD)
Aaaaahhhhhggg

Adelaide Zora and Jason back up into the living room To
their left the “Bad Son” obscured by curtains scurries past
the window

To their right a Sky light crashes The “Bad Daughter”
falls into the kitchen

The “Bad Father” and “Bad Daughter” back the Wilsons into the
Living room as the “Bad Son” scurries past the windows
Adelaide holds her children close as Gabe tries to get up
Wincing he stumbles back into the living room in agony The
“Bad Father” follows him in to the room slowly bat in hand

ZORA

MOM
It’s okay Just stay close

The “Bad Daughter” turns into the living room
The “Bad Mother” enters She is RED Adelaide’s doppleganger
She walks in a calm erudite manner the clear head of her

family

It’s dark Red arrives at the chair in front of them and
sits She motions for them to sit

The “Bad Son” smashes a hole in the back porch door window
and enters

The Wilson’s sit on the couch Except for Gabe who tries to
stand aided by the arm of the couch

The “Bad Son” lights a match in his hand with a SNAP The
fireplace erupts in flames

The fire backlights the “Bad Family” The “Bad Son” shuffles
to Red’s side and sits like a dog She strokes his masked
head

We still can’t really see their features in full but at this
point it’s clear that these home invaders are DOPPLEGANGERS
of the Wilsons

ABRAHAM Gabe’s doppleganger seems a little out of it His
attention wanders like a rampage killer lost in some kind of
psychotic break

UMBRAE Zora’s doppleganger stands with perfect posture
sleeked back hair and an evil little smirk

PLUTO Jasons doppleganger breathes thick under his mask
He carries himself like an animal

The entire “Bad Family” wear red jumpsuits with and sandals
and one glove

Zora starts freaking out

ZORA
What What

JASON
(under his breath)
It’s us

Gabe isn’t ready to believe what’s in front of him

GABE
We don’t have anything here This
is our summer home We got in
today so--

ADELAIDE
--Gabe

Red clears her throat silencing Gabe She speaks Her voice
is quiet and craggy like it’s never been used

RED
Once upon a time there was a girl
and the girl had a shadow
The two were connected tethered
together So whatever happened to
the girl happened to the shadow
When the girl ate her food was
given to her warm and tasty but
when the shadow was hungry she had
to eat rabbits raw and bloody On
Christmas the girl received
wonderful toys soft and cushy but
the shadow’s toys were so sharp and
cold they’d slice through her
fingers when she played with them
Time passed They both got older
and one day the girl met a handsome
prince and fell in love At that
same time the shadow met Abraham
It didn’t matter if she loved him
or not he was tethered to the
girl’s prince after all Then the
girl had her first child a
beautiful baby girl but the
shadow she gave birth to a
little monster Umbrae was born
laughing The girl had a second
child a boy this time They had to
cut her open and take him from her
belly The shadow had to do it all
herself She named him Pluto He
was born to love fire

Pluto growls at Gabe

RED (CONTD)
So you see the Shadow hated the
girl so much for so long until one
day she realized that she wasn’t
being punished by the girl at all
She was being tested by God

INT WILSON HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Gabe tries to present a non-chalant tone and pull Red’s
attention off Adelaide

GABE

car

GABE
--Take whatever you want Hell you
can take the boat for all I care

ZORA
(through tears)
Nobody wants the boat dad

GABE
How about this Take me to the ATM
Ill get all the cash I can take
out and you can go We won’t

Gabe who has been in denial of the supernatural element at
play loses steam

GABE (CONTD)
What are you people

He finally gets Red’s attention She turns her head
disappointed with the question

RED
What are we

Red leans in

RED (CONT’D)
We’re Americans

Red holds up bronze colored handcuffs She gives them to
Pluto who walks to Adelaide and stands on the table

RED (CONT’D)
Tether yourself to the table

GABE
Addy no Don’t--

RED
(to Gabe)
--Or maybe I should cut something
off of you

Abraham takes a step towards Gabe

ADELAIDE
Just don’t hurt the children

Adelaide puts the handcuffs on one wrist and in connects them
to the heavy coffee table

GABE
Hey hey

Abraham grabs him by the wrist Gabe tries to resist but his
knee is jacked and he’s simply not as strong

GABE (CONTD)
Hey Don’t touch me Get off

ADELAIDE
No

Abraham pulls Gabe out the back living room door and off the
back poRch It’s easy as if he’s dragging a toddler in full
tantrum

ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
Okay okay

Pluto starts to growl Adelaide holds it together but her
voice shakes She looks in Jason’s eyes which he diverts

ADELAIDE
Okay Okay It’s okay Look at me
Youre going to be okay Show him
one of your tricks
Adelaide gives Jason a look that seems to say “be smart”
Jasons scared but he stands Pluto grunts jovially and
follows him upstairs

across from one another in silence

ADELAIDE (CONTD)
What

RED
Years ago I had a vision In this
vision I saw a line of blood on the
soil that stretched as far as I
could see

Red stands She slowly walks to Adelaide’s side

RED (CONTD)
During this vision God spoke to me
He said “the only way for a soul to
truly be free is to sever the tie”
And his voice It was the most
beautiful sound I’ve ever heard

A moment of silence Red places her hand on Adelaide’s head
and slowly pushes it to the table

RED (CONTD)
I call it “The Untethering”

INT WILSONS BAYSIDE HOUSE CLOSET NIGHT

Pluto holds a lit match Jason is so scared but starts to
lift Pluto’s mask Before we can see his face the match goes
out It’s dark again Pluto strikes another match and
illuminates his awful face It’s identical to Jason’s but the
bottom half is covered in burn scars Jason WHIMPERS

EXT DOWN THE STREET NIGHT

Zora is out of breath Her running slows to a walk She turns
to look behind her but doesn’t see anything She turns
forward and keeps walking just as we see a shadowy figure
come into view in the distance behind her closing in fast

After a few paces she turns around just as the figure runs
wide behind her Again she sees nothing Crying she turns
back to proceed and finds herself face-to-face with Umbrae
who’s curled around in front of her

to the other side of it Zora sees Umbrae stalking her
through the windows Suddenly Umbrae goes down disappearing

is on the roof of the car leaning over her

EXT OPEN WATER NIGHT

The MOTORBOAT BUZZES Gabe comes to in pitch black He pokes
a hole He’s in a garbage bag lying in the back of his own
boat He looks through the torn hole at Abraham who stands at
the steering wheel with his back to Gabe Gabe looks around
The bat is propped up by Abraham who also has his scissors in
his hand There’s a life preserver floatation device attached
to a coiled rope and tethered to the boat

Gabe starts slowly and quietly to pull himself out of the
bag He peers behind them The lights of the shore are far
and getting further away

He reaches for the floatation device and slowly pulls it
towards him Suddenly the boat’s motor coughs It’s failing
Abraham turns as Gabe shrinks back into the garbage bag
Abraham walks over He doesn’t notice the coil of unwound
rope he’s standing inside of

Abraham begins BANGING the motor exactly the way Gabe did
earlier It’s being stubborn

Gabe slowly crawls forward and gets the bat He sneaks up
behind Abraham and swings just as Abraham turns around
knocking him off the boat As he falls the rope tangles
around Abraham’s foot cinching into a knot The floatation
device and rope goes overboard with him

GABE
Ha ha Fuck you

Gabe hits the motor with the bat in triumph the motor revs
into action The boat takes off sending Gabe off the back
and into the water The boat drives away Gabe wades
frantically He looks around but doesn’t see Abraham
Then Suddenly Abraham surfaces and swings his scissors at
Gabe but the boat is now far enough away that the rope around
Abraham’s ankle goes taught and he is pulled away

Gabe is left there bobbing in the water as the boat pulls
Abraham away on his belly like an unwilling waterskier

Gabe watches as the boat WHIRS away into the dark night
water

GABE (CONTD)
Goodbye

Come here Come here

Umbrae gets off the car ready to pursue Zora Don walks
towards Umbrae

DON (CONTD)

Umbrae stops at “kid” Now she’s angry

As Zora runs huffing and puffing Umbrae goes down and
severs his Achilles tendon with her scissors He screams and
falls to the ground

EXT OPEN WATER NIGHT

Moments later Gabe hears the boat’s motor getting louder
again He prepares himself and faces the boat but when its
about 25 yards from him the MOTOR SPUTTERS out again The
boat slows to a glide and stops near him Gabe looks for
Abraham but doesn’t see him The life preserver floats by
him No Abraham Gabe grabs the rope and pulls himself
towards the boat

He climbs up the back of the boat just as Abraham attacks him
from behind Gabe hangs on the back of the boat with Abraham
hanging onto him Gabe hits the motor twice and it turns on
Abraham who’s torso is pressed against the propeller gets
SLASHED across his chest and face as he falls back into the
water Gabe exhausted falls into the boat as it drives
away

As Pluto grunts Jason begins snapping

JASON
Wait Wait Look

Pluto becomes curious and watches Jason’s hand Jason snaps
faster and faster when suddenly the trick works A few
sparks fly from Jason’s fingers catching Pluto entirely off
guard He’s startled Jason uses the moment to knock him over
and run out of the closet

INT WILSON’S HOUSE FOYERLIVING ROOM NIGHT

Red holds Adelaide down The coffee table cracks even more
Blood starts to pool on the side of Adelaide’s face

Jason trips and falls into the hallway Pluto confused gets
up and lunges towards Jason but Jason pulls the sock out
with his toes and SLAMS the door just in time with his
other foot

Pluto SCREAMS

INT WILSONS BAYSIDE HOUSE FOYERLIVING ROOM NIGHT

Adelaide and Red hear the SCREAM They watch each other for a
moment

ADELAIDE
That’s yours

Red’s still for a moment Then suddenly she stands and
leaves the room headed towards Pluto

Now alone Adelaide leaps into action First she tries to
get out of the cuffs but can’t She tries to break the table
with her foot She sees the fire poker across the room and
goes towards it but is stopped again by the heavy table

INT WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE HALLWAY NIGHT

Red opens the closet Pluto’s inside He stops yelling He
exits and looks around sniffing the air Jason is nowhere to
be seen Pluto skitters into Jason’s room Red starts walking
down the hallway in search of Jason

She takes a step into Zora’s room Red comes out She sees
the basement door is open and goes inside

INT WILSONS BAYSIDE HOUSE FOYERLIVING ROOM NIGHT

Adelaide sees the phone She grabs it dials ‘911’ again and
drags the coffee table a little

As the phone rings she slowly pulls the coffee table towards
the fire poker

RECORDED VOICE
All of our operators are currently
busy Please hang on the line

Adelaide is close enough to almost reach

ADELAIDE
Come on

She grabs the fire poker barely She darts over to the
coffee table and uses the poker and all of her strength to
quietly pry the wooden leg off the table

Adelaide does enough damage to the coffee table to free
herself

INT WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE BASEMENT NIGHT

Red walks through the basement looking for Jason She finds
the box of keepsakes picks up the stuffed bunny and looks at
it

INT WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE HALLWAY NIGHT

Adelaide looks down the hallway She sees no one She
whispers

Jason Jason

She sees Jason’s silhouette emerge from the cabinet in the
bathroom Relief but as he comes closer she begins to realize
it might not be him She clutches her fire poker ready to
strike but as he steps through the moonlight It is JASON

Just then Pluto scrambles out of his room and towards them
like a feral raccoon Adelaide pulls down the bookshelf in
the hallway blocking Pluto who tries to scurry around it

Adelaide grabs Jason and runs to the front door As Red
emerges from the basement

EXT FRONT LAWN NIGHT
They shut the door hard as Pluto gets near

ZORA
She’s crazy she’s crazy

Suddenly they hear the familiar BUZZ of the boat

The Wilson’s race towards the dock Pluto takes off after
them on all fours

EXT DOCK NIGHT

They get to the boat just in the knick of time Pluto lunges
at them but misses As the boat pulls away Pluto stops at
the edge of the dock He MOANS a menacing angry MOAN at them

Red walks calmly down the length of the dock

As the Wilson’s huddle in their boat Umbrae arrives too
back from her run Zora SCREAMS Umbrae paces impatiently
She laughs at Zora The Wilsons are silent with shock except
for Gabe

Abraham washes up on the shore Blood pours from the gashes
on his chest and face The “Bad Family” watch his body
emotionlessly

Umbrae begins to run in pursuit she disappears into the
woods Pluto stares at his father

The house has a modern clean interior and the lights are all

hanging everywhere A second level overlooks the large main

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Josh turns to look up at his daughters on the mezzanine
level A THIRD TWIN lurks right behind Becca

There’s a moment of confusion

EXT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE NIGHT

From outside looking in what commences next can only be
described as a seven second massacre

Three more figures enter from strategic positions They
along with the “third twin” are the “Bad” versions of the
Tylers They quickly and efficiently subdue and stab their
counterparts in the necks with brass scissors Blood
splatters and sprays against the white walls

The “Bad Tylers” stand looking at each other for a moment
Good Vibrations continues playing

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE NIGHT

Kitty Tyler is the still alive She chokes on blood as she
crawls towards her husband’s body TEX Josh’s doppleganger
moves in front of her and holds out his hand She reaches for
it but he pulls it away sadistically pushing it through his
hair

suppresses a laugh with wild-eyed intensity Kitty is
getting weaker The inevitability is sinking in

Dahlia leans over and finishes the murder

EXT THE TYLER’S BAYSIDE HOUSE NIGHT

Adelaide knocks on the front door frantically “Fuck the
Police” by NWA plays inside Jason and Zora help a limping
Gabe up the bayside lawn towards Adelaide and the house Tex
opens the door in Josh’s robe

ADELAIDE
Josh we need help We were
attacked in our home

Texs jaw drops into a shocked expression like he can’t even
process As he opens the door Adelaide sees some blood on
his fingers

Adelaide steps back from Tex who projects an overtly
sympathetic face and grabs her wrist

Adelaide swings her fire poker at Tex It strikes him in the
head hard A trickle of blood rolls down his face but he’s
still conscious

Tex grabs the fire poker and her wrist He tosses Adelaide
over the threshold and onto the floor inside the house

GABE
Hey

Dahlia and the “Bad Twins” NIX and IO pounce on Adelaide
and pull her deeper inside towards the staircase Josh slams
the door behind him staying outside He takes out his
scissors and drops the fire poker

Zora SCREAMS Tex looks at her with sadistic glee

Tex starts making his way towards Gabe and the kids With
each step he takes he makes a different taunting
exaggerated expression like some kind of evil mime

GABE (CONTD)
(To Zora and Jason)
Run

Zora and Jason stunned begin to run towards the driveway
Josh begins to follow them with his wild-eyed taunt

GABE (CONTD)
Hey What are you doing Huh You
think you a man Come get some
then Come try Bitch

Tex can’t help himself He turns away from the kids and
obliges Gabe who backs up towards the dock

Tex delighted with the taunt taunts back He BELLOWS A WEIRD
clicking NOISE at Gabe Crazy

TEX
Click Click Click

He follows Gabe down the hill

The kids look back at their father who is successfully
baiting Tex out towards the Tyler’s dock They then look back
at each other Jason is about to cry again but Zora hits him
in the chest firmly startling him out of it An unspoken
agreement they walk to the house Zora picks up the fire
poker off the lawn

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

Dahlia sits in front of her make up mirror She’s lost like
in a Marlyn Monroe haze She applies make up to her crazy
face like she’s at the peak of glamorous career

Adelaide sits on the floor now with both wrists in the cuffs
and bound to the dresser She looks around while Dahlia is
mesmerized by her Hollywood dream Adelaide accidentally
makes a noise Dahlia snaps out of her daydream and looks at
Adelaide with rediscovery

She approaches Adelaide and puts her scissors up to her face
She tries to decide where and how to cut Adelaide

EXT DOCK NIGHT

Gabe stumbles down the dock where his boat and Josh’s boat
are docked Tex follows

Gabe steps onto Joshs boat

INT TYLER HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

Kitty wants to cut Adelaide so bad but she stops herself
Frustrated she goes to the window She’s waiting for someone
to arrive not here yet She’s getting impatient Dahlia goes
to the dressing room mirror and puts the scissors up to her
face ready to cut INTO HER OWN CHEEK Adelaide looks away

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Zora and Jason open the door The room is a bloody mess The
original Josh and Kitty Tyler’s bodies lay lifeless

They quietly walk through the living room towards the stairs

They hear a THUMP THUMP from upstairs that stops them dead in
their tracks Jason picks up a heavy geode mounted on a metal
stand He shrugs They push forward up the stairs

As they get to the top of the stairs they see a red
jumpsuited twin cartwheel across the doorway at the end of
the hall

Zora and Jason hesitate before continuing down the hallway
past the dead original Tyler twins on the floor As they
reach a corner A GALLOP QUICKLY APPROACHES It’s Nix who
runs towards them at an alarming speed She bares down on
Zora with her brass scissors but Zora whacks her hand first
sending the scissors skidding across the floor

Zora hits her again sending her awkwardly careening over the
edge of the mezzanine and SMASHING through the coffee table
below

They continue past an open closet when Io’s legs lower from a
handstand in the closet She pops out lunging at them but
Zora nails her on the head with the fire poker knocking her
down Zora winds up and finishes her with two more WHACKS
Done Their adrenaline spikes from the trauma but they must
move on

EXT TYLER DOCK JOSH’S BOAT NIGHT

We see through Gabe’s eyes Crouched in the small dark cabin

The boat moves as Tex steps onto it He leans over into the
boat

Gabe face illuminated red as he shoots a flare gun at Tex
The flare misses but hits the side of the boat and lands in
the boat

The flare illuminates the entire area as Gabe gets the upper

hand and bashes Tex

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

The glow from the flare outside illuminates the entire
bedroom Dahlia rushes to the window with a freshly bloody
face Her eyes widen with excitement and horror A SILENT
SCREAM that loses itself in its own production and somehow
ends with a almost tickled glee

The door behind Dahlia slowly opens Zora takes a couple of
steps towards her and swings but Dahlia sees her in the
reflection of the window and turns catching the fire poker
She overpowers Zora who screams as Dahlia falls on top of
her

ADELAIDE
No

Adelaide lunges towards them but is stopped by the handcuffs
Dahlia raises her scissors over her head when all of a
sudden Jason stabs her in the back of the neck with the pair

he picked up

MOMENTS LATER

EXT THE TYLER’S BAYSIDE HOUSE NIGHT

Gabe gets to the front door Just before he can grab the
knob the door swings open It’s Zora covered in blood
She’s exhausted and out of it

She helps her dad in and they shut the door

The rest of the Wilsons clock her and one by one turn their
attention to the TV

Moments later

INT TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

hear some more harrowing first hand
accounts that paint a picture of
deeply disturbing and clearly
connected event which is very much
still in progress
If you’re just tuning in there is
still so much we don’t know but we
can say with some confidence that
we appear to be in the midst of one
of the most brutal and terrifying
wide-spread and coordinated attacks
this country has seen There is
obviously a lot of misinformation
out there so we’re being careful
what we report but what is clear
is that there are multiple
assailants and multiple casualties
and one common thread seems to be
the use of scissors or shears to
commit these attacks

GABE
And they look like us

ADELAIDE
They don’t even know that yet

NEWS ANCHOR (0C)

To our knowledge no group has
taken credit for this attack
And We have new images coming
in

We have new images coming in from
Chicago

chain down the middle of a street There are several dead
bodies laying nearby

This Okay this seems to be a
group of individuals engaged in
some sort of demonstration or
protest

It’s not clear at this time if or
how these people are connected with
the attack that is taking place
but A new bloody doppleganger
goes to join the line Other
“tethered” come from different
directions to add to the line as
well The anchor is stunned and
silent for what feels like an
eternity

She moves through walking towards Red’s back She just SNIPS
away

the Tethered For generations the
Tethered continued without
direction They all went mad down
