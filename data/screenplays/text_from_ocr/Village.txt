INT HILLTOP NOON

“One might describe the scene as beautiful if one could get by the child’s
’ coffin

A wooden sign in the dirt reads

“Here lies Daniel Nicholson
Beloved by all
Died October 3 1897”

A wilting man in his late forties sits on the grass next to the much too small
box

MAN(smiling)
Who will plague me with
questions now Who will
pinch me to wake me up Who
will laugh at me when I fall
(voice cracks)
Who’s breath will listen to so
that may sleep Who’s hand
will I hold so that I may walk

The wilting man’s face trembles

Behind him a respectful thirty feet away stand a group of about sixty
people equally still

EXT SUPPER TABLE - AFTERNOON

An enormous handmade wooden table sits in the center of a smal village of
Jog cabins All sixty members of the village are seated for the meal

The women wear bonnets The men have their farmer’s shirts rolled up at
the sleeves

‘THEN THE SCREAMS SLOWLY START TO MOVE AWAY

A man in his late forties stands He has the eyes of a child innocent and

pure This is EDWARD WALKER

WALKER
We came here to start anew-

Beat Eyes look up one by one Edward Walker stands silently appearing

suddenly overwhelmed A hand reaches up and squeezes his arm Edward -
Walker Jooks down to the wilting manwe saw earlier They look ateach
other quietly

‘Walker turns back to the table

WALKER
We came here to start anew
We are grateful for the time we
have been given

Walker sits Movement begins across the table as hands begin to pass bread
and corn and meat

AND THEN WE HEAR IT THE SOUND CARRIES THROUGH THE
AIR AND BLEEDS INTO THE VILLAGE IT COMES FROM THE
WOODS

SCREAMS IT 1S NOT HUMAN
All movement at the table stops except for a TALL BOY at the end of the
table He is barely in his twenties He is mentally handicapped He starts

clapping wildly

Everyone else sits uncomfortably still No expressions on their faces They
wait

The boy’s clapping slows and then stops as well The happiness trickles
from his face

The rest of the table waits til the last of the nonhuman screams have moved

away And then quietly hands start reaching across the table again

plates ata hand water pump that stands in the ground

“A strong older woman pumps the handle Bursts of water spurt out from the

pump’s mouth Two girls are holding bowls under the water One girl gets
splashed by the other They both start laughing The older woman makes a
disapproving noise with her mouth The girls looks over nod and return to

washing the bowls little grins on their little faces

porch Jike dancers

They’re giggling stops as one spots something They both stop p dancing
They look down at the base of the post that holds the porch roof up There
are two RED WILDFLOWERS peeking out from the fist full of weeds

They bend down quickly and yank the red wildflowers out They move off
the porch and knee down in the dirt-next to the porch

They use their hands to dig a small hole in the dirt They put the crushed red
wildflowers into the hole and methodically bury it

The two young women stand look around and wipe themselves off before
returning to the porch and picking up the brooms again

A group of children carrying cloth bags with books in them crowd around
something in the dirt

Edward Walker moves through the tiny gathering

WALKER
What manner of spectacle has
caught your attention so —
splendidly I ought to carry it
in my pocket to help me teach

Edward Walker parts the final layer of titillated children He stares down at
the thing on the ground Beat His expression becomes grave

WALKER
Who came upon this

It takes a moment before a little boy steps forward His eyes never look up

WALKER
Philip did you move this

PHILIP shakes his head “No” Everyone watches Walker who tums and
looks down again quietly

ITIS HARD FOR US TO SEE THROUH ALL THE TINY LEGS AND
FEET OF THE CHILDREN THERE IS SOMETHING DARK AND
MOIST LYING IN THE DIRT

CUT TO

INT CLASSROOM MORNING

The classroom is overcome by whispering Walker uses chalk to write the
date “October 5 1897” on a gray slate board framed in wood —

He turns to the children who range in age from seven to twelve

WALKER
Okay let’s have it What
delicious conclusions have you
come to

THIN BOY
An animal God created was
slain

WALKER
Donald please try to speak
plainly It disturbs your mother
when you speak so darkly
Everything need not be said
with such drama

Another hand shoots up
WALKER
Marybeth
MARYBETH

I inspected it carefully Its head
was twisted back and much of
its fur was removed

WALKER
I see

DONALD
It was murdered

Now the children become quiet

WALKER
So who is the culprit Who has
done this heinous act

Beat

MARY
Those we don’t speak of killed

it

WALKER
And there it is
- (beat) °
Why would such a notion enter
your heads

TWELVE-YEAR OLD BOY
Those we don’t speak of eat
smaller animals

BROWN EYED GIRL
Those we don’t speak of have
claws

WALKER

Children Those we don’t
speak of have not breached our
border for many years We do
not go into their woods and
they do not come into our
valley We do not threaten
them Why would they do this -

DONALD
It is a warning of the doom to
come

Walker watches the image of the foxes scamper

WALKER
(stern)
Donald

Walker gazes out at the classroom of concerned children

WALKER
Is it possible in your haste you
have missed the simplest
explanation That this small
animal was slain by a slightly
larger animal like a fox and
that this said fox carried it into
our village to avoid other
scavengers from coming and
eating his prize And when our
village awoke and started its
morning business the fox was
scared off and left its prize for
us to find

(beat)

I can’t say if that’s what really
happened but it’s certainly
more reasonable to think that
than something
unprecedented

MARY
I did see two foxes on the hill
yesterday

WALKER
Does anyone have further

questions pertaining to our

immediate doom

Walker winks at Donald No one raises their hand ‘

through the minds of the

WALKER
Then if it is agreeable let us
begin our studies

One by one the children reach into their cloth bags and retrieve their

notebooks

INT MEETING HALL - AFTERNOON

We are in one of the largest cabins Wooden chairs are scattered throughout

This is some sort of gathering place

Twelve of the chairs have been brought together in a circle Twelve of the
oldest members of the village are seated in the chairs

The Wilting man and Edward Walker are among them

FIDGETY WOMAN
We ought not to overlook the
Flight of the Birds We didn’t
have it last year and I for one
missed it desperately I know
Tabitha missed the children
dressed in feathers and such

A small gentle woman with her hair tied back looks up TABITHA sits to
Edward Walker’s side

TABITHA
J am fond of it

The two women slowly turn to Edward

EDWARD
I do not have a say in this
matter August Nicholson is
Chair of today’s meeting

exhausted August nods as he shuffles the papers in his hand

AUGUST
The Flight of the Birds will be
returned to this year’s Fall
Festival

The groupnods quietly

FIDGETY WOMAN
Let us speak of food then

THERE IS A KNOCK at the far end of the room All attention moves in that
direction

Another man in his mid forties steps in He carries a tiny smile his eyebrows
are raised
MAN
There is a young man who has

requested a word with the
elders

The group looks to one another This is unusual

AUGUST
Do have himn come forward

The man with the raised eyebrows steps out Beat The door stays still for a
moment and then it opens

A sinewy young man in his twenties steps in His deep-set brow and dark
green eyes never look up as he walks forward to the group

There are many glances to a pretty elder in her forties Edward looks to her
as well She stares back with the identical dark green eyes as the boy She
shakes her head slightly She doesn’t know why he’s here
The young man slows toa stop a few feet from them His hand t brings a
-paper up He begins to read carefully

GREEN EYES
My mother is unaware of the
reason for my visit today She
did not give her consent or
consult me in any form

The woman with green eyes moves forward in her seat without knowing it

GREEN EYES
J have spent all but my first
years in this village It is all that
I know It is a blessed place
this village Our days are filled
with love and compassion and

joy
His green eyes flick up just for a momenit He returns to the paper

GREEN EYES
But there is also some suffering
and fear The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness-

August Nicholson goes still

GREEN EYES
-and other events have
weighted on my thoughts We
have been taught of the greed
and corruption that exists in the
towns And the countless
wasted lives centered on the
exchange of money there But
we have also been taught about
their fascination with science
and machines and medicine

Beat

GREEN EYES
Could they have rescued Daniel
from his terrible illness

(beat)

1 ask permission to cross into

the forbidden woods and travel

- to the nearest town I will

gather new medicines and
information of what has
happened in the world and I
will return

Her eyes close

ALICE
How can a mother fail to
recognize her son Tell me
Tell me that

Lucius watches his mother become quiet Her breathing becomes steady and
soft

Lucius walks into her room and takes the quilt from the rocking chair and
gently places it over his mother’s sleeping shoulders He whispers in her ear -

LUCIUS
I do think about love

Lucius walks out of his mother’s room and exits the cabin quietly

EXT TOWER — NIGHT

FINTON COIN is a skinny boy with big curly hair He is on the platform
tonight thirty feet in the air

The trap door opens as Lucius climbs up Finton immediately relaxes

FINTON
Did anyone see your approach

Lucius shakes his head “No”

FINTON

I saw Christop Crane sniffing
around He suspects something
He has announced more than
once in my presence that only
one man should hold post in the
tower each night Why would
he say such a thing if he didn’t
suspect What a wretch he is
Is it so bad to be a trifle timid

a FINTON
7 Are you sure you were not ©

detected

Lucius shakes his head again “No” as he takes his seat in the corner Beat

FINTON
And I shared a portion of my
chicken with him not two days
ago A fine tender piece

The two young men fail into silence one sitting one standing And then out
of the silence-

LUCIUS
Do you ever think of the towns
Finton

Finton tums to the sound of Lucius’ voice

FINTON
The towns What for They’re
wicked places where wicked
people live that’s all

Finton doesn’t notice the expression on Lucius’ face as he sits in the
shadows Finton shrugs his shoulders and returns to Jooking out Beat

with deep red pickings

On the ground near the trees are baskets filled with apples A few are ©
toppled over

Standing in a tight group a few feet from the abandoned baskets are a group
of women The same quiet fearful expressions on their faces

They stare at something at the base of a tree We can’t see what it is but we

INT MEETING HALL — AFTERNOON

Every member of the village is jammed into this little building The elders
are standing towards the front of the room

Alice Hunt’s green eyes look compassionately over the gathering

ALICE
What we seem to have amongst
us is a scavenger of some type
Most likely a coyote or wolf
It’s manner of killing and
removing the fur but leaving
the flesh torn may be a sign that
the animal may suffer from
madness

An uncomfortable murmur flutters in the meeting room

ALICE
For the next fortnight we
should be vigilant for sightings
of this coyote Keep careful
watch over the little ones as
they play on the hills
(lowers voice)

As for the other notion we do
not believe our boundary has
been breached Those We
Don’t Speak Of are much larger
creatures than coyotes We
would know if they had been

KITTY

You do not believe me
WALKER

J have no judgment yet
KITTY

It must have been bubbling
inside me for a long time for it
came bursting forth not three
days ago I have thought of
nothing since

Edward nods his head

WALKER
‘Burting forth’ is it

KITTY
I realized since I’m the eldest
of your children and since you
were stricken with five girls
and no boys I decided to act as
if I were the son and ask your
permission

WALKER
- must correct you on the word
‘stricken’ I would not trade
any one of my five daughters
for a hundred of the finest boys
So now what is it you are
asking permission for

KI
I would like permission to
marry Pappa

WALKER
There is a proper manner in
which these things are to
happen Such as the boy would
normally be standing next to
you at a moment such as this
Where is the boy in all of this

Noah is bigger stronger and faster but hehas a hard timecatching the blind
young woman running ahead of him She moves effortlessly She does not

use her stick She knows every step of these hills She taps a tree as she runs
by She is laughing as she runs

Noah passes her just as they finish They both are out of breath as they reach

the rock formation

One rock juts out at the base of an enormous wall of rock buried into the
side of the hill There is shade here This is Resting Rock

There is someone sitting there when they arrive Noah goes right over and

sits with him Ivy sits and catches her breath before looking in their
direction -

IVY
My sister cried a lot

Lucius stops eating the biscuit he has wrapped in his handkerchief for his
lunch break Beat

Ivy
Do you wonder how I
recognized you

Lucius stares at the striking girl with the sweaty face and messed hair

- IVY
Some people just a handful
mind you give off the tiniest
color It’s faint like a haze It’s
the only thing I ever see in the
darkness Papa has it too

Lucius gazes quietly at Ivy as if she was a sorcerer Noah just smiles Beat

IVY
Do you wonder what your color
is Well that I won’t tell you
It’s not ladylike to speak of
such things You shouldn’t
even have asked

‘Lucius fights a smile Noah runs off after some nearby birds

Ivy smoothes her wrinkled dusty frock It is an uncharacteristic nervous

gesture
IVY
(serious)
I know why you denied my
sister
Lucius’ smile melts away
IVY

When I was younger you used
to hold my arm when I walked
Then suddenly you stopped
(beat)
One day J even tripped in your
presence and nearly fell J was
faking of course but stil you
did not hold me -

Ivy
Sometimes we don’t do things
we want to do so that others
won’t know we want to do
them

Lucius is about to say something when Noah comes back Noah sits down
between them Lucius turns his piercing eyes back to his biscuit

Noah h reaches i into his pocket He clutches something i in his hand He puts it
into Ivy’s lap

IVY
What’s this
She feels it in her hands Z
IVY

A flower what a splendid
present

Lucius glances over He goes still Beat

LUCIUS
(low)
Be cautious You are holding
the bad color

Ivy’s face changes as she holds the RED FLOWER

IVY

(even)
Noah it is not allowed This
color attracts Those We Don’t
Speak of You must bury it

She holds j it out to a saddened Noah Her hand is trembling slightly He
takes it back after a moment

IVY
You ought not to pick t that color
flower anymore

Lucius gazes at the flower in Noah’s hand

LUCIUS
He did not pick that now

Beat Ivy’s head turns a quarter turn towards Lucius

IVY
What’s wrong You’re
breathing has changed

LUCIUS
I’ve never set eyes on such a ©
flower

‘Lucius and Noah look at each other Beat

this

Lucius’ green eyes look up from his paper
WALKER
You do not need to address us

so formally You may just
speak

Lucius stares at the group of elders seated on the wooden chairs before him
Alice watches her son Jower the paper at his side He just stands there Beat

LUCIUS
We mustn’t-

Lucius eyes drift down He tilts the paper slightly as he tries to read the
words at a steep angle at his side

LUCIUS
We mustn’t-

Edward smiles
WALKER
Lucius you may read from the

paper if you wish

Lucius brings the paper back up
“ 39

LUCIUS
-or consult me in any form
(beat)
Today at Resting Rock Noah
Percy handed Ivy Walkera
flower of the bad color

Edward Walker sits up just a bit at the sound of his daughter’s name

LUCIUS
When asked where he found
this flower for it was not like
others I have seen he took us
’ there He led us to the peak of
the hill by the tree stump
There he pointed to a bush
covered in flowers of the bad
color

Lucius looks up He doesn’t look down when he says the next six words

LUCIUS
He was pointing into Covington
Woods

Lucius returns his eyes to the paper

LUCIUS
By my eye the bush of the bad
color was at the very least
seventy-five paces past the
forbidden line

Beat
LUCIUS
It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods and has
done so on many occasions

LUCIUS
It is also my belief that because -
of his innocence those
creatures who reside in the
woods did not harm him
(beat)
This strengthens my belief that
they will let me pass if they
sense I am not a threat I ask for
further consideration in my
request to travel into the woods
so that I may gather medicines
and informations from the
nearby town

Lucius slowly lowers his paper He exhales very slowly The elders just
stare

CUT TO
EXT SCHOOLYARD — AFTERNOON

Noah makes monster sounds He holds his hands up like claws as he slowly
chases the pack of laughing and screaming children around the playground

The group of elders have gathered at the edge of the schoolyard They watch -
Noah carefully as he runs around with the other children

Noah bares his teeth and growls as he catches one of the laughing ten-year-
old boys in the pack Noah picks him up and throws him to the ground hard
The child starts crying

- TEACHER
Noah Percy

Noah stops acting like a monster He runs and hides behind the other
children

‘The elders watch as the teacher pulls Noah off the schoolyard Noah is
throwing a slight tantrum as he is led to his punishment

‘INT HUNT CABIN - NIGHT

CUT TO

Alice Hunt sits at her small table Hands folded on her Jap

Lucius sits across from her His eyes flicker from the lamp light on the shelf

Lucius is shaking

ALICE
-” We shall speak of the town just
this once and we shall never
speak of it again

ALICE
When we lived there the three
of us you were but an infant I
would be telling an untruth if
said there was no joy We were
contented souls the three of
us But contentment is an

unwelcomed alien in the towns

There is something in the very
nature of the cities and towns
that rejects it Society survives

on greed and desire Its heart is

fed by wants It has no place

for something so untradable
and old fashioned as
contentment

(beat)

Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday at quarter past
nine in the morning He was
found robbed and naked in the
river two days later

LUCIUS

(barely audible)
Why do you tell me this
blackness

ALICE
So you will know the nature of
what you desire

LUCTUS
J do not desire it

Alice is sincerely unsettled by the sight of her son on the verge of yelling

LUCTUS
‘My intentions are true to my
word J think of nothing but the
people of this village

Alice lowers her eyes Beat She speaks in a softer voice

ALICE
I know that Forgive me am
but scared for my only son’s
life -

LUCIUS
J am not the one with secrets

Alice’s eyes lock on his

ALICE
What is your meaning
(beat)
Speak Do not retreat to your
silence yet

Lucius stands from the table He moves across the small room

LUCIUS
There are secrets in every
comer of this village Do you
not feel it Do you not see it

Lucius points to the bl ack box seated j in the corner of the room on a small
table It is identical to the one we saw in August Nicholson’s house

ALICE
That is for our own well being
So the things that scare us do
- not have power over us

LUCIUS
Then let us open it

ALICE
No-°

Alice looks ready to rise from her chair t to stop him Lucius doesn’t move
Beat

Alice visibly composes herself Her hands return to her lap
ALICE
(soft)
Perhaps we should speak with

Edward Walker together He
may-

LUCIUS
He hides too

Alice stares quietly at the stranger before her
LUCIUS

(soft)
He hides his feelings for you

‘Alice instantly rises from the table and moves into her room with great
dignity
LUCIUS
(calls to her)
Sometimes we don’t do things -

yet others know we want to do
things - so we don’t do them

Lucius doesn’t even understand what he said Alice walks back out of her
room

ALICE
What nonsense are you saying

Lucius is flustered He gathers his thoughts and looks to his mother Beat

LUCIUS
You needn’t worry Nothing
will happen to me

Alice gazes upon her son
ALICE
(gentle)

You remind me of a colt
sometimes

Alice moves back to the chair she started in Lucius takes his seat across
from her Beat

‘Alice cleans some dust off the table as she speaks

through their own thoughts CANDLIGHT flickers on this painting of a
‘mother and son at a wooden table

CUT TO
EXT BORDER DAY

We are at the edge where the grass ends and the woods begin On every tree
that touches the grass isa yellow slash of paint Every fourth tree holds a
flag of the same color

Two young men replace a broken flag They both wear hooded cloaks that
touch the ground The cloaks are a mustard-yellow

The young man who has been boosted up loses his balance He quickly
grabs a branch and steadiest himself He looks down to his partner They
share a tension filled jook as they glance into the forest They work as if they
are on a tight wire

A third young man in a mustard yellow cloak passes them Lucius carries a
wooden bucket of yellow paint He nods to them as he passes

Lucius walks along the perimeter of trees He stops a handful of trees down
the line The paint on this tree is fading Lucius dips the handmade brush
into the bucket and puts another coat on the tree

He picks up his bucket and continues on He glances over his shoulder asthe
figures of the two young men get smaller and smaller Lucius keeps walking

- He passes the large tree stump
Now he slows to a stop again He looks to the woods Seventy five paces

away from where he stands nestled between two thin trees is A BUSH
BLOOMING WITH RED FLOWERS

46

He looks down the line of trees to the two young men they move along the
perimeter and slowly move out of sight

Lucius steps to the edge of the grass His shoes are inches away from the
dirt of the forest floor In the dirt clearly visible to the eye are groups of
LARGE CLAWED FOOTPRINTS The indentations from the claw points
dig deep into the soil se

Lucius does not acknowledge any of this He stares quietly into the woods
‘ lowers his bucket to the ground Beat

HE STEPS OVER THE FORBIDDEN LINE INT O COVINGTON
WOODS

Lucius walks calmly His shoulders graze branches as he moves His eyes
stay Jocked on the bush with red flowers

WE HEAR A NOISE IN THE WOODS Lucius does not look over

He takes the last few steps to the bush He reaches into it and snaps off a
branch He straightens up

And then for the first time we sense him pausing

He tums and looks slowly over his shoulder

THERE IS SUDDEN MOVEMENT LEAVES AND BRANCHES SNAP
AS WE SEE FIFTY FEET AWAY THE DARK FORM OF A HUMPED
-CREATURE STANDING UPRIGHT IT SUDDENLY MOVES WE SEE
IT STRIDE AWAY INTO THE DENSENESS OF THE WOODS’

Lucius tums and starts walking Branch in hand he moves at a calm even

pace as he heads back to the bucket with yellow paint

But he does have a gentlemanly
way about him and he does care
for my sister deeply I think
Kitty is blessed

Ivy
