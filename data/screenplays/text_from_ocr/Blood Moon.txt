FADE IN

OPENING CREDITS
Background of the rising moon and it is Blood Red

Over this background the silhouettes of several fighters cross
back and forth throwing beautiful techniques hitting each other

Various other IMAGES of victims women swords weapons also
appear and then disappear Various Chinese characters all with a
MOON motif also appear

At the end of the credit roll one fighter the Killer stands
alone still in silhouette his arms raised to the sky

Fresh blood streams down the moon covering this image DISSOLVING
into the exterior of an old style traditional boxing gym

EXT BOXING GYM NIGHT

A back to the basics kind of gym full of old leather punching
bags and even more leathery fighters There are several cars in
the parking lot and the lights are on

INT BOXING GYM CONTINUOUS

In the ring a very muscular FIGHTER is sparring rounds He is very
good scoring at will on his sparring PARTNER The sense of
confidence the Fighter has can be FELT as he plays with his
Partner flicking in and out making contact but doing no real
damage

He is not however trying to put his sparring Partner out

There are people all around the ring working on heavy bags speed
bags treadmills exercise bikes stairclimbers

A banner above the ring reads Home of the Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World

The bell sounds and the action breaks in the ring both fighters
hitting their gloves together and going to their corners

CORNERMAN
Way to go Champ Closing time

FIGHTER
Im going to work the bag Ernie Listen
you go on Ill lock it up

The cornerman agrees and the fighters start migrating to the
doors

INT BOXING GYM LATER

The Fighter is hitting the heavy bag while in the WINDOW above
him the Blood Red Moon fills the glass

As the Fighter hits the heavy bag he hears something and suspects
that something is wrong Coated in sweat he goes looking around
the gym

He looks in several shadowy places only to find nothing Shaking
his head he starts back towards the heavy bag when he hears

KILLER
You fight well
(beat)
Champ

The KILLER a tall very muscular very handsome man appears at
the other end gym He moves with an easy grace and comes closer
to the Fighter The Fighter sizes him up An air about the Killer
tells the Fighter he knows what hes talking about

FIGHTER
All dressed up and no place to go

KILLER
You dont have the killer instinct
(beat)
I can show it to you
FIGHTER

Is that a fact Well maybe some time we
could go a round or two

KILLER
No time like the present Or are you
scared

The Fighter sizes the Killer up for a moment then smiles a small
confident smile

FIGHTER
You got a death wish buddy

KILLER
Did you notice that there is blood on the
moon tonight
The Fighter doesnt know what to make of this remark as they head
for the ring

The Killer and the Fighter climb up into the ring and face off

A single overhead light SHINES down on them throwing strange
SHADOWS on the ring and on the walls of the boxing gym

The killer starts toward the Fighter a small smile on his lips

KILLER
The key to winning is to take advantage of
every weakness Like how you never really
cover your side

He swings quickly three times and BURIES three deadly hooks in
the mans kidneys The Fighter bends over in pain his hands at
his side

KILLER
Always attack is lesson two

And the Killer does just that He throws powerhouse punches and
the Fighters defense cannot withstand the barrage He is getting
HIT
HARD

FIGHTER
Hey man thats enough

The Fighter has his arms up covering his face and head
Surrendering
KILLER
Its never enough Lesson Three A true

champion never goes easy never lets up

He comes on the blows cruel and calculated The Fighter doesnt
stand a chance

The Killer keeps punching his gloves glistening with the
Fighters blood

KILLER
Fight Goddamn it FIGHT

But in the face of the Killers onslaught there is no fight
only slaughter The Fighter falls to the canvas but the Killer
continues to drive his fists into the fallen man until there is no
more movement

The Killer stands over the fallen fighter
KILLER
Schools Out Champ

He turns to the window of the gym and raises his arms to the
moon

EXT STREETS MORNING

Establishing shot New York streets A man is riding a motorcycle
on the streets

EXT BOXING GYM CRIME SCENE MORNING

The boxing gym has been turned into a Crime Scene with police
cars in front of the gym Their lights flash against the dawns
light

CHUCK BURKE a black detective about 35 years old rides up on his
Black TRIUMPH motorcycle He gets off and walks into the busy
crime scene In front of the entrance to the gym is a pile of
stuff and Chuck instead of climbing over it gracefully jumps
from place to place in a very acrobatic way

The cops around the scene see him but they are used to his
eccentric ways They ignore it

INT BOXING GYM CONTINUOUS

Burke strides confidently into the boxing gym taking in
everything as he walks to the two UNIFORMS near the body

CHUCK
What do we have here ladies Somebody
talk to me

Chuck absently runs a scarf through his fist and it comes out
alternately blue and red red and blue

CRIME SCENE COP
(looking at his notes)
Well Detective we have one dead boxer
Eddie Cunningham 33 years old Light
Heavy Champion of the World Found in the
ring this morning (beat) Somebody beat
him to death

CHUCK
Guess we got a new champ Is this the

latest from our boy Do we make it three

CRIME SCENE COP
No witnesses no finger prints plenty of
blood and guts

CHUCK
Any chance he left a suicide note
(after a beat)
Boys and girls sounds like we have
ourselves a homicide

They share a grim smile and Chuck kneels down to look more
closely at the body Chuck shakes his head at the grisly sight

CHUCK
What the hell is going on

He runs the scarf through once more and it comes out completely
white

He respectfully lays it carefully over the face of the dead
Fighter

EXT POLICE STATION MORNING

Chuck arrives at the station and sees a phalanx of reporters
surrounding CHIEF HUTCHINS He looks frustrated and a little
angry Chuck quickly about faces and heads for a side door As he
goes we SEE Hutchins talking to the media

REPORTERS
(stepping on each other)
Is this the work of the same man
Do you have any suspects
What are you doing to catch him
Any communication with the killer

HUTCHINS
We are following up every lead We are
very close to cracking this case We just
need patience and cooperation from you
people in the media

Chuck pushes his way through the crowd to the side entrance of
the building

INT POLICE STATION LATER

Chuck comes in and sits down wearily at his desk It is covered
with papers maps notes books etc There are martial arts
magazines scattered all over his desk

CHUCK
Tell the ME I want her report on my desk
as soon as she has it I waited 15 damn
minutes for her bankers hours ass to come

SECRETARY
Chuck Chief on line 2

Chuck hits the phone off its cradle catching it while it is still
up in the air With his other hand he is juggling two balls in
the air

CHUCK
Hey hey hey This is Burke Im working
it Chief

HUTCHINS
Goddamn it We need some answers Son of a
bitch

CHUCK

Chief chief whats with that language
Yes Sir Yes Sir

Chuck moans and takes the phone away from his ear not listening
any more The Chiefs voice tinny and thin is heard through the
earpiece He puts the phone down on his desk and stands up to
meet one of the other OFFICERS in the squad who walks in to bring
him a computer print out a new challenge from the Killer

Chuck holds it up looking at it closely

OFFICER
Came in last night Before the boxer

Chuck nods his head and shrugs

It is a computer print out of a graphic a moon with blood on it
and the words Blood on the Moon

Chuck turns to his bulletin board and pins it up along with the
other messages challenging taunting deriding He continues
juggling with one hand

CHUCK
Variations on a theme Why didnt I get
this last night

OFFICER
It was attached to e-mail addressed to the
Chief

CHUCK

(wincing)
Did you see him Did he have the face
on

At this moment the Chief appears behind Chuck who is still
juggling the balls

CHUCK
Oh man the bulging eyes the popping
veins the quivering lips
ANGLE ON OFFICER
Who is reacting to the Chief standing behind Chuck
CHUCK
Hes standing right behind me isnt he I

TOLD you not to bring these balls in here

The Officer walks away quickly anticipating the fireworks

He turns around to face the enraged Chief still juggling The

Chief takes the balls from him one by one

HUTCHINS
Were up to our eyeballs in murder
victims and youre screwing me around
Any idea the pressure on me I was
crucified this morning by the press

Chuck tries to charm the Chief

CHUCK
Thats because you Chief are the man
Hey great to see you You should slum
down here more often

Chuck reaches out to smooth down his lapels and pulls a silver
dollar out of his jacket showing it to Hutchins with a flourish

HUTCHINS

Get some results Chuck You ever do that
again

(pointing at the phone on

Chucks desk)
The Great Chucker can book himself magic
shows in Atlantic City cause he wont be
working here

(beat)
Juggle these balls

The Chief stalks out of the doorway tossing the juggling balls

back to him When he is gone Chuck smiles

Chuck turns back to his wall scanning all the collected
information He starts juggling as he looks through it all

CHUCK
Hell Atlantic City If I could conjure
this sicko out of thin air Id be

headlining in Vegas
HOLD on picture of Moon

EXT MOON NIGHT

Empty shot of Blood Red moon in the reflection of a puddle of
water A car SLICES through the water and the CAMERA TILTS UP to
reveal an establishing shot of a Sleazoid Bar

INT SLEAZOID BAR CONTINUOUS

The bar is smoky and nearly empty DUTCH the owner of the bar
is a big muscular man who looks like he doesnt take shit from
anyone His trophies and photos from his fighting career rare all
over the bar

Dutch and his lady ROXY very sexy though a little slutty are
alone in the bar Roxy is sitting at the bar and she wants to
dance and Dutch complies They start to sway to the slow music
and Dutch kisses Roxy She responds and soon they are on one of
the pinball machines Dutch is undressing Roxy when she thinks
she heard something

ROXY
What was that

DUTCH
Nothing Dont break the mood

Dutch gets Roxys shirt off and starts on her bra but she is
sure she heard something She tries to push Dutch off but he is
in heat and wont take no for an answer He goes for her shorts
and has them unzipped before she can push him away

ROXY
I heard something goddamn it

DUTCH
Nobodys gonna mess with me babe Youre
just being stupid

ROXY
Thanks a lot
She starts away to look around the bar pulling her pants up as
she goes

DUTCH
Come back here you bitch

ROXY
(to herself)
My luck with men is for shit

KILLER
Roxy your luck is about to change

She turns with a wary look on her face and the Killer gently
CHOKES her out He catches her before she hits the ground and
lays her down carefully on the floor He then advances on Dutch
who has his back to the bar

DUTCH
You find anything

KILLER
She found me Crutch

DUTCH
The names Dutch

KILLER

It wont be after tonight
(he sizes up Dutch)
Marvelous night for a moondance

Dutch is ready for the Killer itching to fight The Killer moves
out to face Dutch He puts a scared face on

Dutch attacks and hits the Killer several times The Killer is
not fighting back he takes a couple of awkward swings but
misses by a mile

Dutch thinks hes in full control

The Killer backs up and holds his hand up

KILLER
(scared voice)
Can we talk this over Please

Dutch laughs and closes on The Killer

DUTCH
No way Youre mine

The Killers scared demeanor changes completely and he stands up
to his full height
KILLER
(smiling)
OK
He attacks Dutch first tearing him apart The Killer really takes
it to Dutch never letting up He hits him up one side and down
the other
Dutch is helpless

The Killer is enraged

He was looking for a good fight but hes not getting it Its the
pugilistic equivalent of a barrel shoot

KILLER
Why arent you better

He hits Dutch at will

KILLER
Tough man Youre not tough

The Killer grabs him by the head from behind and smiles He is
going to kill him

The Killer stops smiling and looks almost like he is going to let
Dutch go But then he wrenches Dutchs head breaking his neck
and killing him He lets Dutch slide to the ground

The Killer walks away from the death

INT MORGUE MORNING

The shattered body of Dutch is on the examining table the MEDICAL
EXAMINER having just finished the autopsy

Standing with him are Chuck Chief Hutchins and one other
OFFICER

MEDICAL EXAMINER

extremities the bones were shattered

MEDICAL EXAMINER
The killer has a knowledge of anatomy the
destruction is systematic precise every
strike is a vital area a nerve center or
a meridian He definitely has a signature
I recognize it

Chuck just nods

CHUCK
Any evidence of a weapon Or post mortem
mutilation

MEDICAL EXAMINER

EXT SEASHORE DAY

We open on a little girl LAUREN seven years old working on a
sand sculpture on the beach There is a straw sticking out of the
front of the sculpture Lauren is very concentrated on making the
sand as smooth and as nice as possible Suddenly the sand
sculpture SHIFTS a little

LAUREN
Dont move Dad

Just then the sculpture SNEEZES and ex-cop now retired KEN
OHARA comes out of the sculpture shaking the sand off of him
He ROARS like a monster and CHASES Lauren and they go running
into the water

EXT BOARDWALK LATER

Ken and Lauren are walking down the boardwalk with Lauren It is
their one day together Several SHOTS of Ken and Lauren tenderly
interacting shopping sharing an ice cream walking hand in hand
arm in arm

Suddenly a group of motorcyclists come near them Ken
reflexively and protectively pulls Lauren out of the way

As he does this Ken BUMPS into TERRY who is standing with his
GIRLFRIEND and a couple of other FRIENDS

Ken bump sends Terrys beer spilling all down the front of his
shirt and pants Terrys Girlfriend immediately laughs out loud

Terry spins around to face Ken really angry

KEN
Sorry man I wasnt looking where I was
going

TERRY

Youre gonna be sorry

KEN

Terry looks at his girlfriend who is still laughing

FRIEND

He pushes Ken HARD and Ken goes backward He is careful to gently
move Lauren out of the way

KEN

Terry advances on Ken and there is now a crowd of people
surrounding them watching the action

TERRY
Cmon man Put em up

KEN
Look I said I was sorry Hitting me isnt
going to dry your shirt

TERRY
Yeah but its gonna make me feel a hell
of a lot better

Terry takes a swing at Ken and he evades it sidestepping him
Terry keeps coming swinging wildly

Terrys girlfriend laughs even harder and Ken notices this He
shakes his head and resigns himself to the beating

Terry swings again and makes contact this time doubling Ken
over He hits him again and again and Ken just takes it

Hes not getting really hurt hes avoid most of the hits and
dissipating the force out of the others but hes not fighting
back

LAUREN
Daddy (to the Leader)
Leave him alone

KEN

TERRY

Terrys girlfriend is cheering for her man now and Terrys
Friends are impressed by his machismo

Ken gets taken to the ground and Terry towers over him

TERRY

KEN

LAUREN
Stop it Stop it

She rushes up to Terry and pulls on his arm trying to get him to
stop

TERRY
What do we have here

Terry smiles menacingly and pulls his open hand back to SLAP
Lauren

Suddenly it is stopped in Kens powerful grip

KEN
I dont think so

Terry goes to punch Ken again and Ken blocks it this time and
takes the man down subduing him As soon as he does this
however he is attacked by the Friends

Four to One

The odds are seriously against Ken

The Friends dont stand a chance

Ken handles them all his movements graceful beautiful powerful
He finishes them off not reveling in the violence In fact he
puts them out as humanely and quickly as possible They end up in
a pile on the ground Kens last action is a flying sidekick that
sends one of the Thugs OFF his motorcycle

Ken stands over them for a moment and Lauren runs up to him
hugging him and they continue to walk down the boardwalk
together

KEN
Im sorry you had to see that honey You
OK
She nods yes
LAUREN

Are you I dont like fighting
Ken stops and kneels down to talk to his daughter

KEN
I didnt want to fight them Lauren but
he was going to hit you I had no choice
Nobody hurts my family

LAUREN

KEN
They couldnt hurt me Im like Superman

LAUREN
(laughing)

She laughs and spins away from him Ken stays kneeling down and
holds up his hand to her

KEN
Hey help Superman stand up OK honey

She pulls him up and they continue walking down the boardwalk
hand in hand

startled and she stumbles into Chuck He catches her and they
share a laugh

Just then Ken comes walking up the sidewalk with his daughter He
sees Megan and Chuck embracing and grimaces He doesnt like

A few
(beat)

Were dealing with a very organized
killer someone who plans These killings
arent random spur of the moment things
He only kills who he wants to kill Low
risk victims in low risk areas no
witnesses everything planned out very
well

Out of the corner of his eye Chuck sees the Chief leave He turns
his attention back to Ken

KEN
His behavior reflects his personality and
his behavior is very controlled well
orchestrated His MO exists nowhere
else Now I thought

Chuck holds up his hand for Ken to stop talking

CHUCK
Let me stop you right there I know who
you are Ken You quit the force because
you were scared I cant partner with a

guy who is going to piss himself when he
comes face to face with the enemy

CHUCK
So you can have all the bullshit theories

INT RESTAURANT NIGHT

Ken and Chuck together sitting at a table in a restaurant They

are just relaxing fooling around Chuck is doing a magic trick

and Ken is laughing as Chuck makes the water disappear in a glass
right in front of his eyes They havent completely become great

friends but they are getting there

KEN
He didnt spring from nowhere This guy
had to have trained Hes too good

CHUCK
No one teaches killing people

KEN
Hes testing different killing methods We
believe the arts effectiveness but hes
actually trying it out Hes got a list of
victims

CHUCK
And we just made the top forty

KEN
Ive got the feeling that hes almost
done I just wish we knew the sequence
Who was next

He pauses for a BEAT looking into his glass of beer

CHUCK
Whyd you quit Ken

Ken looks at him for a long moment trying to measure why Chuck is
asking

Finally he sighs and resigns himself to telling the story maybe
for the very first time

KEN
I was working serials like you I tracked
the bastard got inside his head he had

killed 10 by then and I took him down
But I had seen too much done too much I
just never wanted to experience that kind
of evil again Didnt want it in my
life

CHUCK
He messed you up pretty good right

KEN
Almost killed me Killed my marriage too
Im trying to salvage it but you saw

for yourself
Chuck nods remembering the scene at Kens house

CHUCK
I was married long time ago When I was
in the academy It ended badly and I
blamed it on the job but that wasnt it
I just didnt try hard enough

KEN
Too bad

CHUCK
I dont know much about you Ken but you
dont seem like the kind of guy to give
up Am I right

KEN
Yeah I guess

CHUCK
Then you shouldnt give up on your
marriage man To this day my only regret
is that I didnt save my marriage when I
could have All I had to do was call
her

They sit in silence for a moment

CHUCK
All you have to do is call her

KEN
How is this parable about you suddenly
about me

CHUCK
The moral of the story is just give her a
call see if you can save it You got the
chance Take it
KEN
Maybe I will

CHUCK
Youve got motive and youve got
opportunity Youre guilty

He points to a line of phones at the back of the bar
Ken looks at the phones then back at Chuck

KEN
You know nothing about me

CHUCK
Dont want to know any more Believe me

Chuck produces a coin from Kens ear

CHUCK
Tell you what Heres an ordinary quarter
If it lands heads you call her Deal

Ken nods and Chuck flips it It comes up heads and Ken loses

Ken nods grabs the coin from Chuck going to the phones Ken
starts to put the coin in the slot then realizes it is a two
headed coin He smiles and throws the coin back to Chuck then
digs a quarter out of his pocket and dials

brief moment then the Killer disappears

Ken looks around moving through the forge
The Killer appears again and they fight some more

The Killer is leading him somewhere

The Killer then disappears again

Vanished

ANGLE ON KEN

He is looking through the factory complex He passes through
cavernous rooms and small office areas the glass in the windows
and lights long since smashed

He doesnt see anything or anyone out of the ordinary

Ken continues searching and he comes to a decrepit section of the
Forge and across the floor Ken sees

The Killer standing with his back to Ken

Megan and Lauren are tied up in the bg in a showplace position
behind the Killer

A BUNDLE is strapped to the wall behind them

He sees the situation and knows that he has to fight
The Killer settles into a fighting stance

KEN
They are nothing to you

KILLER
Exactly but they are everything to you
Now you have the motivation to fight me
with everything you have You are like the
samurai ready to die

KEN
I hope youre ready to die motherfucker

Ken walks up close to him and assumes a fighting position
They fight

The Killer KIAIS loudly and attacks

As the fight goes on it becomes clear that Ken is overmatched
and he is going to lose Ken is a superb fighter but so is the
Killer The Killer gets hit a little bit but he is doing more

damage to Ken that he is taking

Its going to take a little time but Ken is going to lose

And that means he is going to die and so are his wife and
daughter

KILLER
I still havent met my match

KEN
Youre going to meet your maker

KILLER
Not today

They continue to fight and it is spectacular

But Ken is losing Only by a little bit but the Killer is just a
little faster a little better He is no match for the Killer who

is a phenomenal fighter
The Killer senses that he has the advantage and starts to take
the fight to Ken Soon Ken is in real trouble and the Killer is

setting him up for the kill

Angle on Timer its getting close

ANGLE ON MEGAN AND LAUREN

They are terrified

ANGLE ON KEN AND KILLER

Ken is helpless and the Killer reaches back preparing the
killing strike a smile on his face

The Killer strikes the killing blow and
Chuck comes out of nowhere and KICKS blocking the strike The
Killer still hits Chuck in the leg and he collapses on the

ground

CHUCK
Go after them

The Killer enraged attacks Chuck hitting him at will
Ken meanwhile heads for Lauren and Megan

The Killer spots Ken running for his family and leaves Chuck
cutting Ken off

KILLER
You couldnt save Kelly your partner
your family And you cant save

yourself
They fight each other and the heavens open

Lighting flashes and the Gods watch the fate of the world in the
balance

Ken unbelievably is getting the upper hand He is taking a great
deal of punishment but its with a purpose

He is taking a shot to give a better shot and for the first time
in his killing spree the Killer is hurt

Soon Ken is taking less punishment and meting out more

ANGLE ON TIMER ITS ALMOST GONE
The Killer starts looking for somewhere to escape to get away
from this fighting machine that doesnt care about pain about

injury

KEN
Nowhere to run asshole

He SLAMS the Killer over and over finally finishing him off with
a series of beautiful techniques
ANGLE ON TIMER 30 SECONDS LEFT

grabbing them trying to shield them from the force of the bomb
ANGLE ON TIMER COUNTDOWN TO ZERO

The bomb EXPLODES

Ken THROWS Megan and Lauren to the ground protecting them from
the blast

But the blast is not what they expected

Its no bomb at all its a firework that has thrown millions of
pieces of silver confetti into the air

Its beautiful and its harmless
They are alive and they are unhurt
Ken goes to them throwing his arms around them

Chuck appears in the midst of the silver shower smiling and
holding up his hands He is hurt but still alive

KILLER VOICE
No slaughter of the innocents OHara

The Killers voice is coming from a small digital recorder
linked to the package
