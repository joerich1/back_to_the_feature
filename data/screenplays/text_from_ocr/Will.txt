EXT SPACE - DAY
Establishing shot of Earth from space

AIMSLEY (V0O)
The world

EXT SUBURBS MORNING

Sunshine A butterfly lands next to a squirrel on a tree
branch The squirrel spots an acorn in the road and crosses
the branch causing a leaf to detach and fall The leaf and
squirrel take identical paths to the ground Sights and
sounds harmonize The day is a composition The squirrel
darts in front of a chubby boy who is riding a Razor scooter
The boy swerves and crashes into a bush His candy bar and
Slurpee fall to the ground The butterfly lands on the boy

AIMSLEY (VO)
I love it

From the bushes the boy’s eyes widen as he spots a frog He
crawls out and grabs the frog saving it from a passing car

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
It’s got a special blend of cause
and effect which gently guides
each moment into the next

The car zooms by breaking the acorn and sending the leaf
whirling The leaf and butterfly move in synchrony Then as
if choreographed the squirrel and leaf arrive at the acorn
The squirrel starts to eat the acorn while the boy holds up
the frog and looks into its eyes for a moment Then he
shoves the frog into his pocket The butterfly floats away

INTEXT WILL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

The car is a crappy dusty hatchback The driver WILL 34
unremarkable eats an apple while he talks on a cell phone

AIMSLEY (VO) WILL
The world follows a simple (distracted)
set of basic rules Uh huh

As he drives Will writes “3” in a square of a Sudoku puzzle
The puzzle sits on Will’s empty passenger’s seat Out on the
sidewalk a mailman approaches a house A dog begins to
attack the mailman
AIMSLEY (VO) WILL
Or laws of Nature (into headset)
Uh huh Yep

Traffic slows to a stop Will checks the time Across the
street a man holding a broom stands at the side of his house
He looks up at a wasps’ nest lodged under his gutter and
pokes it with the broom Angry wasps burst forth He sprints
for his front door It’s locked He begins to wildly swing
his broom at the attacking wasps as Will drives by

WILL
(into headset)
Yes Right Honey

Will takes a final bite from his apple He opens the window a
a few inches and tries to toss the apple through it Nope It
hits the inside of the window and falls back into his lap

WILL (CONT‘D)
Son of a bitch
(then into headset)
Nothing

He opens the window and angrily whips the apple core though
it It lands not far from an apple tree Nearby a man drives
a lawnmower in his yard He turns just as Will does The car
and lawnmower are perfect unwitting mimics of each other

AIMSLEY (VO)
And those basic rules form
patterns countless patterns

Behind the mower a continuous pattern of diagonals The next-—
door neighbor on a similar mower has mowed the same pattern

INT TRACYS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TIGHTON a photo of a bath towel in a catalog Its diagonal
pattern is an exact copy of the lawns TRACY 30 cute
intense looks at the catalog Her desk is as neat as her
hair T RAC Y¥” in craft letters hangs from a shelf
Various Post-It notes adorn her cubicle As she talks on the
phone she aligns a figurine with a row of others on her desk

TRACY
(into phone)
Will I really need you to want to
be part of this decision

She compares two sets of towels from two separate catalogs
Like the lawns the towels are virtually indistinguishable
WILL‘’S VOICE
Okay Right

Surrounding the figurines are photos of Tracy and Will over
the years at a football game in college at a Halloween
party as Bonnie and Clyde vacation at Disney World then a
studio portrait- sitting on a rug in matching outfits jeans
white linen shirts bare feet They are incredibly typical

TRACY
Are you listening to me

She removes a piece of dust from her desk Next to a catalog
photo of an ottoman she places a Post-It note “Maybe” She
straightens the Post-It and glares at a less tidy co-worker

WILL’S VOICE
What Honey

She repeats the question The SCREEN SPLITS With each word
other people having the exact same conversation in various
places around the world chime in It grows geometrically

I 2 people “said” 4 “are” 8 “you” 16 etc
TRACY GROWING NUMBER OF OTHERS
(with others) “Are you listening to me”
“Are you listening to me”
WILL 256 OTHERS
(with others) Yes of couse

Yes of course

EXT “COFFEE COFFEE” -— MOMENTS LATER

One of the 256 others is ANGELA 30 pretty She is standing
in front of a coffee shop with PAUL 40 handsome He is
wearing rollerblades and elbow padsand knee padsand
wrist guards He puts on his helmet Definitely not cool

ANGELA
Yes of course

PAUL
Okay Let’s do lunch on campus

ANGELA
Um we’ll see Let’s talk later

Will pulls into the parking lot
INT EXT WILL’S CAR — CONTINUOUS

Will finds a space not far from where Angela and Paul are
standing He puts the car in “park”

WILL
(into headset)
Um well see Let’s talk later
Yes Uh huh-- No I do care about
the towels Okay Gotta go Bye

Will hangs up undoes his seat belt and looks at his watch
WILL (CONT’D)
(shaking his head)

Jesus Christ woman

A noise from the phone He looks at it - He hasn’t hung up

WILL (CONTD) AIMSLEY (VO)
(scrambling scared) You might even call some
Shit patterns “tendencies”-— sort

of built into personalities

Will hangs up removes the earpiece and looks down noticing
the odometer 4599999 He refastens his seat belt then
backs up the car a bit drives forward then back again
Back and forth some more as Angela and Paul continue talking

PAUL
-- then I have to go to Pilates--

They are both distracted by Will’s back-and-forth driving

ANGELA
(watching Will)
That guy must be very indecisive

Paul doesn’t get the joke SUDDENLY he spazzes loses his
balance and falls into Angela’s arms

ANGELA (CONT’D)
Whoa Easy Knievel

PAUL
I got it I’m fine
(he’s not)
You threw off my balance babe

ANGELA
Are you sure it wasn’t your wrist
things or your cup or something
INTEXT WILL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Finally Will’s odometer clicks 4600000 Yes Will checks
his watch again Crap He hurries

AIMSLEY (VO)
Of course it’s not all patterns
and rules and tendencies There’s
some chaos and chance mixed in too

Paul skates away awkwardly He hits a bump and jerks
backwards He almost falls but recovers Will gets out of his
car and shuts the door It catches his tie He starts to walk
but is yanked He jerks backwards exactly the same way Paul
just did This saves Will from a clump of falling bird shit

AIMSLEY (V0O) (CONT’D)
But beneath all of the chaos there
is a hidden order

INT COFFEE COFFEE - MOMENTS LATER

Will gets into a line of customers A busboy slips He jerks
backwards exactly as Paul and Will just did The tray of
coffee mugs in his hands crashes to the floor

WAITRESS
(sarcastic)
Nice Paco Like clockwork

A few more customers get in line behind Will each passes an
unnoticed cluster of cookie bits on the floor TIGHT ON A
line of ants leads up to the cookie bits PULL OUT The
people and ants are lined up in the very same formation The
broken coffee cups and cookie bits are arranged identically

Above the coffee shop birds float by in the exact formation
as the customers and™ants The birds approach clouds which
are a perfect copy of the cookie bits and broken coffee cups

AIMSLEY (VO)
Its a delicate balance which is
subtle People don’t notice it
Theyre not supposed to People
play a different role They’re the
stars of a million trillion little
stories

Will sneezes He looks at his hand He thinks about wiping it
on his shirt but spots an old lady squinting at him He
leaves the line for a napkin passing
DUMB GIRL
(into her phone)
No Stupid “touche” is French It
means you know touche

OLDER TAN LADY
(into her phone)
And then I was like “These are my
titties Carlo”

BUSINESSMAN
(into his phone)
You know Dave The midget No
the Asian one

ANGELA
(into phone)
Well tell him that there aren’t a
lot of places to do compatible
determinism right now and also
that he is a fat idiot

A heavy-set man hears this Angela doesn’t see him

ANGELA (CONT’D)
(into phone)
I know he’s not really fat but he
has that look - like he’s gonna be--
(listening then)
Two words Lady hips

She notices the man Oops She smiles at him

ANGELA (CONT’D)
(then into phone)
Not that “fat” always equals “bad”

Will returns to the line He squeezes in front of a TOUGH
GUY 30 muscles tan hair gel who has taken his spot

TOUGH GUY
What are you doing

Angela still on the phonewatches the scene in front of her

WILL
Just getting back in line

TOUGH GUY
I don’t think so
WILL TOUGH GUY
But-- You left the line It’s not
my problem Numb Nuts

ANGELA
(to herself)
Numb Nuts

WILL
Oh come on--

TOUGH GUY
Go to the end of the line Faggot

ANGLE ON Angela she’s interested THEN Paco worried
THEN Ants oblivious THEN the tough guy’s shirt “Female
Body Inspector” Will recoils and moves back a place

WILL
(to Angela as he steps in
front of her)
Hi

ANGELA
(into phone)
Karen hold on for a second
(to Will)
What are you doing

WILL
Uh--

ANGELA
Are you cutting me Cutter Hey
weve got a cutter here

All eyes focus on this confrontation

WILL
ce No No -F was--

ANGELA
I’m kidding Youre fine there
“Numb Nuts” Don’t worry I respect
the principles of spot-holding
unlike some people

The tough guy glares at them then faces forward again Angela
smiles at Will He tries to smile back but looks uneasy

ANGELA (CONT‘D)
(to back of tough guy)
Nice tan Hercules
The tough guy turns around This is not what Will wants

WILL
That was her

EXT ROADINT CARS - MOMENTS LATER
The squirrel is eating the candy bar the chubby boy dropped

AIMSLEY (VO)
Now combine the patterns and the
chaos with the underlying order
Then add some living things and
natural light and what you get is
the singular spectacular
production called Earth

The squirrel darts in front of the tough guy’s Porsche He
brakes hard His coffee spills all over him Will stops
behind him The Sudoku puzzle slides off his seat and falls
to the floor revealing a book Communicate with Your Mate
Dr Bill’s Relationship Rescue Angela stops behind Will and
waits to make a left turn she sings along with the radio

ANGELA
(singing tentatively)
I like big butts and I can not lie

A driver pulls up beside Angela She becomes self-conscious
and stops singing She sees an opening in on-coming traffic

ANGELA (CONT’‘D)
(to herself)
You can make that

She hesitates inches forward THEN out of nowhere The
chubby boy on the scooter appears--

aoe - ANGELA (CONT’D)
(swerving)
Whoa

The boy swerves and crashes into the stopped Porsche He
plops onto its hood His Slurpee spills all over the car He
grunts The frog crawls out of his pocket and hops away

As Will drives off his phone rings “Tracy” He presses
“Ignore” leans down grabs the Sudoku puzzle and puts it
back on top of the book Will checks his watch and passes
some children playing basketball in a school playground
EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - LATER
Establishing shot of a bustling college campus

AIMSLEY (V0)
I‘ve always been into the people

A student walks by and gets beamed in the head with a
frisbee

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
I love to think about how they
spend the little moments

INT CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

In an empty classroom Angela goes to erase the board Chalk
dust in the eraser makes a mark She notices this and starts
to pat the board with it making what looks like a bunny A
colleague enters and Angela quickly erases her artwork

EXT ROAD — MOMENTS LATER

A car honks and whizzes past Paul who is now standing on the
side of the road with his hand in his crotch He removes a
cup from his shorts turns it right-side up and reapplies it

INT TRACY’S JOB - MOMENTS LATER

Tracy is eating tiny carrots She stares at product photos of
throw pillows on a website called “Pillow Paradise” She puts
a Post-It on her monitor It says “Pillow Upholsterer”

EXT COMPU-TAUR OFFICES - LATER

A large bland building “Compu-Taur IT Solutions” A
landscaper working in front of the building stares at a
fiberglass Minotaur that has a computer for a head

INT COMPU-TAUR OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

In a giant grid of cubicles a small man struggles to replace
the large heavy bottle on the water cooler It gets away
from him He soaks himself
WILL (0S)
(to himself)
Come on

A large woman wearing headphones rocks out at her desk The
programmer next to her leans farts and then fans it at her

WILL (0S) (CONT’‘D)
Come on Where are you

TIGHT ON an intricate colorful page in a Wheres Waldo
book Will‘s finger enters frame and lands on Waldo

WILL (CONTD)
(whispering)
Yes Gotcha

Will’s cubicle like his car and clothes is messy Charts
and schedules surround him A framed studio portrait of Will
and Tracy like the one on her desk jeans white linen
shirts bare feet But in this photo they are sitting with
several white cats for some reason A Post-It on Will’s desk
reads “Meeting with Ken”

Will looks at the note and sighs anxiously then back to
Waldo Waldo stares back at him from a crowd Will starts to
pick his nose Suddenly MARIE 35 bitchy appears She
clears her throat Will looks up slams the book shut

MARIE
Kens going to have to reschedule
again He’s very busy

ANGLE ON Ken’s office KEN 45 greasy puts cologne on
himself using a free sample from a page in a men’s magazine

MARIE (CONTD)
(before Will can respond)
How ‘bout next Friday
ANGLE ON A large stash of puzzle books and self-help books
behind Will’s desk A book Assert Yourself sits beside
Really Assert Yourself “From the Author of Assert Yourself”

WILL
Next Friday You know this is the
third time that--

MARIE
Great

Marie walks away Will angry (if a bit relieved) starts to
type the new appointment into his on-screen calendar
ll

WILL
(calling to her)
This is total bull--
(then to himself)
Unbelievable

An Instant Message pops up on Will’s screen from Jason
Biatch It reads “Yo Douche Bag” Marie passes JASON 35
He is checking out AMY 25 hot as she bends over and
punches her computer tower On Jasons screen is a video game
and a reply message from Will “Working Talk later” Marie
passes the small wet guy as he dabs himself with napkins She
knocks over a large stack of folders on his desk

MARIE
(remorseless)
Oops

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

A bunch of employees watch two co-workers perform a “funny”
song On the wall hangs a sign Compu-Taur Corporate Identity
Day Jason pours some vodka into a punch bowl near a table of
pitiful hors d’eouvres Will is talking with Amy

WILL
But the great thing about computers
is that they’re great followers
You just have to tell them the
right things to do and they do it

AMY
Sounds like my ex-boyfriend

She laughs Will takes a long drink from a paper cup The
“funny” song finishes Applause SUDDENLY a drunk Jason hops
up on a chair He raises his paper cup to toast the room

oo - JASON
A toastto all the ladies You
make this company hot You know who
you are
There are basically no women in the room or on staff

JASON (CONTD)
Tech ladies rock my cock

Laughter and cheers

JASON (CONT’D)
And a toast to
(scanning the room)
To Will Will give us a toast

The room goes silent All eyes on Will He freezes and stares
at the audience A shiny bead of sweat rolls down his face

WILL
Uh Uh I uh

He goes to pick up a cup It slips He tries to save it and
knocks over another cup spilling a drink on the small guy

WILL (CONT‘D)
-Shit

The crowd erupts with laughter Will panics and runs out of
the conference room His co-workers playfully boo and hiss

INT COMPU-TAUR BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Will stands at the sink and splashes cold water on his face

WILL
(to the mirror)
Relax Deep breath

AIMSLEY (VO)

Now when I said I loved the people
and the world and everything I
meant it

We PULL UP through the roof into the sky THEN to black
THEN sparks THEN daylight We PASS INTO Another Dimension

EXT THE BEYOND - CONTINUOUS

It’s sunny beautiful - like wine country but more things
can fly This is clearly another world

AIMSLEY (VO)
-But more from a distance
Because I’m not from the world

A man and a woman stroll and talk The man’s shirt reads “I
Heart Humans” A dog with large wings floats by

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
I live in-- well it’s kind of a
different dimension
A woman stands before a crowd in a gazebo Through a portal
she presents an ocean wave down on Earth They applaud

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
I guess you’d call it The Beyond
It’s the place moments come from

We PUSH IN to what looks like the back lot of a giant studio

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
Even though we are not on Earth we
are involved with it intimately
You see we produce the Earth

We pass a building labelled “Truth” then a building labelled
“Beauty” then a building labelled “Bugs”

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
It’s actually a bunch of different
departments working together

We PULL UP between “Existence Management” and “Craft
Services” Buildings stretch infinitely over the landscape

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’‘D)
There are departments for just
about everything

A large building in the foreground “Department of Things”
Next to it “Department of Additional Things”

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
It’s all very organized - some say
too organized I don’t think so

A small building reads “Department of Departments” next to
Liaison to Department of Departments”

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
- The Beyond is not perfect It’s
just closer to it Literally

We PAN TO a building called “Department of Perfection” It is
undergoing renovation as usual A guy walks by and trips

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
We work in a higher realm where
time and space move differently

We PASS a building labelled “Time” In one window different
parts of a room are elapsing at different speeds
fay

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
In fact the other day I figured
out that one week in the Beyond is
equal to about one year on Earth

A toddler smoking a pipe operates an intricate machine An
old lady carrying many boxes walks into then through a wall

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
Were not angels but not people
either We’re kind of in between
I guess youd say our role is more
technical than spiritual Like me
for example I’m a life writer

PAN TO a building called “Life Writing” Inside several
writers stand in front of a projection of a person AIMSLEY
25 is the youngest writer in the room

AIMSLEY (CONT’D)
(impatient)
-That’s why I’m saying “Let’s
give him a limp or social anxiety
disorder”

EXT COMPU-TAUR OFFICES - DAY

Jason and Will eat lunch at a picnic table behind the office
Amy passes in the distance They wave to her She waves back

JASON
God she’s hot

They watch Amy as she suddenly kicks a pigeon

JASON (CONTD)
And pretty weirdBut I like that

He peers at Will’s-sandwich- it looks healthy and disgusting

JASON (CONT’D)

JASON
You lost me at “sprouts”

WILL
This is a gourmet sandwich
dipshit
JASON

WILL

No thanks Tracy and I just cut
processed sugars out of our diets

Jason shakes his head He and Will eat some more

WILL (CONTD)
Kens purposely avoiding me Hes
trying to screw me again

JASON
Listen Ken’s an asshole But it’s
your fault too

WILL
What

JASON
If you want a promotion you have to
go get it Don’t be so passive

WILL
But I’m due--

Will bites into his sandwich

JASON
(mimicking)
“But I’m due--” Horse shit You’re
almost 35 Stop being a pussy
Dont be so afraid of things

WILL
Afraid

ne -- “JASON
Yeah Afraid of Ken of dogs of
ever taking any chances Guess
what Will- life is unpredictable

(re Will’s sandwich)

Go ahead Eat those green pubes all

cancer

Jason bites into a Twinkie defiantly
WILL
(defensive)
Okay First of all I’m only afraid
of dogs that look like wolves--

JASON
Dude you get diarrhea when you
have to speak in front of people--

WILL
Well sorry I’m not “Mr
Spontaneous” So I don’t do speeches
or sing songs or dance dances Big

programmer not a showman

JASON
“Showman” What is this the 19th
century

WILL

jealous Because while youre at
the arcade eating ring dings I’m
moving in with Tracy eating right

me down and start growing up

Jason looks at him and thinks for a moment

JASON
You have sprouts on your chin
Asswipe

INT WRITERS ROOM - DAY

Aimsley stands by a projected hologram of a woman It is
covered with notes He is working with TERRENCE 40 LUCY
35 BRIAN 35 and ERIC 30 who is leading the rewrite

AIMSLEY (VO) LUCY
Sometimes we work in groups What if she gets amnesia
to do rewrites on life
scripts that need it

AIMSLEY
Nah Amnesia’s overused
ERIC
Not necessarily
TERRENCE
What about drugs
AIMSLEY AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
No It’s challenging because our
writing only controls so
much

The projected woman is part of an interconnected diagram
Lines link to other people in her life story The diagram
rotates revealing its connection to a massive causal
tapestry It rotates more Values for things like “Guilt”
“Insecurity” and “Body Odor” become visible

AIMSLEY (VO)
There are other factors involved
like matter physics causal
chainsand Eric who is a prick

ERIC
(to Aimsley)
So quick to shoot down ideas yet
so little to contribute

Aimsley puts up his index finger- as in “Hold that thought”

AIMSLEY
I’ve got it She forgets her keys
which leads to a class 2 self-
sabotage That goes into a Murphy
relapse just before he returns
so She remembers him but is
still emotionally unavailable

They consider this Brian types on a small keypad and the
diagram changes fast-forwarding through projected outcomes
for each person init (like a rapid slide show) Next to the
words “Relative Chaos Level” the word “Acceptable” blinks

BRIAN
Wow That works

TERRENCE
That solution is elegant

LUCY
And it gets us right into the Age
35 Crisis Wonderboy does it again

AIMSLEY
(to Eric)
You were saying
ERIC AIMSLEY (V0)
(moving on) Age 35 is what we call a
Okay We’ve got Siamese twins “pivot year” in a life
in Canada talking over each script Pivot years are
other important in a person’s life

because they help us shape a
person and guide their fate

INT SPLIT-SECOND FILMS - DAY
A younger Aimsley stands in front of hundreds of screens

AIMSLEY (V0)
Only a select few get chosen to
life write It’s a huge honor You
see every person on Earth has a
destiny It’s our job to make sure
it happens I got called up to life
writing about 35 Earth years ago

Wearing a headset Aimsley directs 50 things at once

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD)
At the time I was working at Split-—
Second Films I used to direct the
films that flash in front of
people’s eyes just before they die

We ZOOM through the portal down to Earth It’s 1966 An old
man is moving a piano with a friend at the top of a stairway

OLD MAN AIMSLEY
I got it I got it Okay and roll it

As the -piano crashes a split-second-long film flashes before
the man’s eyes Bam He arrives in the Beyond Staffers greet
him Two men dressed as angels (who look like they’re on
break) quickly run over to play their roles in this scene
Two lighting guys and a lady with a harp are there too

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONTD) AIMSLEY (CONTD)
This might sound braggy but Okay and
I was pretty much the best in
the field

We ZOOM DOWN A daredevil is about to jump his motorcycle
over a running helicopter He speeds towards the ramp

INT LECTURE ROOM - DAY

Aimsley and six other new writers sit near the front of the
room About 200 older writers sit behind them On the walls
impossibly intricate charts and graphs One reads “The
Universe” another “Intramural Schedule” The head writer
MAX 55 brilliant lectures Eric sits nearby

BIMSLEY (VO)
Each of us was hand-picked by Max
head of the department and all-
around legend in these parts

MAX
Soon you’ll be writing balancing
human destiny with the laws of the
Universe Try notto fuck it up

AIMSLEY (VO)
My recruit class was large there
were 7 of us Terrence came from
Skies Lucy worked at Emotion
Brian Hiccups Everyone was
impressive I was the youngest In
fact I was the youngest life
writer ever hired Even younger
than Eric when he started Again
not bragging - just explaining

MAX
--Alright Let me introduce you to
some of the current staff Tommy
A dumpy-looking bald man stands up
et -°MAX (CONT’D)
Thats Tommy He wrote Gandhi

INT LIFE WRITING BUILDING - LATER

Eric is giving the new writers a tour They walk past various
offices terminals and viewing screens

ERIC
Now back when Max started they
used to write every word of a
person’s life

(MORE)
iN
Oo

ERIC (CONTD)
Earth had fewer people then and
they didn’t live as long It was
easier

They watch two cavemen on a screen As one caveman grunts a
page from his life script FADES UP next to him

CAVEMAN 1 SCRIPT PAGE
Ugh Ahm Ohnd Brah Ugh Ahm Ohnd Brah

ERIC (CONTD)
But over time things changed As
society developed scripting grew
more complex More people meant
more stories and more life writers

They watch a screen that splits into hundreds of smaller
screens showing scenes from Earth in the past

ERIC (CONT’D)
But along the way something
convenient happened People
actually became more predictable
thanks to societal conformity and
the pioneering work of Max’s group

Pairs of people are having the same conversation

ERIC (CONT’D)
So nowadays we don’t have to
write every word in a life script
We just write the key scenes
People basically fill in the rest
for us

TIGHT ON One of the screens Two hippies are having a
conversation They look very similar to the cavemen

HIPPIE 1 SCRIPT PAGE

Ugh I’m stoned Bro Ugh I’m stoned Bro
ERIC (CONTD)

You see once a human being gets a

sense of his own limitations he

does exactly what you’d expect And

that’s great because it makes free

will much more manageable

INT LIFE WRITING LAB - DAY

Max lectures to the new writers using floating diagrams
iN
ray

MAX
Have fun with childhood Even for
the most ordinary person childhood
involves a high degree of freedom
That’s when they really dream

The diagram changes It shows a human developing

MAX (CONTD)
Of course by adolescence those
dreams need to be curbed Use the
awkwardness of puberty to
transition into more routine
behavior and realistic tendencies
“Growing up” is key in controlling
individual and overall chaos

INT LIFE WRITING CLASSROOM - DAY
Eric lectures to the new writers in front of sample pages
ERIC
-When it’s done I’1l look at
your scripts Each should then get
a green light and go to production
And that is when your person is
“born” as they say Good Luck
INT WILL’S CAREXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Will drives by the campus

WILL AIMSLEY (VO)

experimental pieces

ANGLE ON A homeless man on the quad He is dancing around

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
And every now and then a
masterpiece

PULL OUT He is dancing in front of a statue of Aristotle

AIMSLEY (VO) (CONT’D)
But the vast majority fall
somewhere in the middle

We MOVE from the statue INTO a building KAREN 30 bookish

electrodes attached to his head An assistant shows the
student a sad film while simultaneously tickling him

EXT CAMPUS - NIGHT
Angela stands with Karen Karen’s colleagues are waiting

KAREN

ANGELA
Nah You guys have your whole Psych

ANGLE ON Karen’s colleagues They are doing trust falls

ANGELA (CONT’D)

having a breakthrough on my paper

KAREN
All theory and no action makes
Angela a dull girl

ANGELA

ready to write an important life

Max pulls out four tattered scripts and throws them on his
desk in front of Aimsley

MAX
Here are four stock lives We use
these for about 95 of all the
lives we write Pick one use it as
a guide and start writing

AIMSLEY
- Stock lives But I want to write--

ERIC
Someone major Of course you do

MAX
And you might eventually But you
have a lot of ordinary lives to
write before you can even pitch a
major life A major life affects so
Many other lives You don’t just
waltz in and write one It’s a
privilege you earn

scripts They’re basically
interchangeable anyway

TERRENCE
Wow Can you do that

AIMSLEY

EXT LIFE WRITING BUILDING - DAY

Rain falls from colored clouds floating in the Beyond

INT LIFE WRITING BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
Max is walking down a busy corridor Aimsley approaches

AIMSLEY
Max do you have a minute

MAX
Not really I’m getting slammed
with all this unexplained weather
crap You can walk with me though

AIMSLEY
I wanted to ask you about free will-

As they pass an office marked “9 Deja Vu” a staffer walks
up to-Max-with a decument

MAX
(to Aimsley)
Hold that thought

Max looks at the document and signs it The staffer walks
away with the document

MAX (CONTD)
(to staffer)
See you tomorrow
(then to Aimsley)
Sorry Where were we Oh yes
(MORE )
Max pulls

MAX (CONT’D)
Free will Getting a little ahead
of yourself aren’t you

AIMSLEY
Just interested And I thought I
might try to outline a major life

MAX

Bad idea You’re not ready
AIMSLEY

But I’ve--
MAX

Settle down hotshot You’re not
going to skip any steps here But I
will answer your question The
question is not whether a person is
free It is to what degree does he
use that freedom

a floating chart from his pocket and references it

Aimsley takes notes

They walk

MAX (CONTD)
People have free will They always
have But in the modern era theyve
pretty much eliminated it - on
their own from not exercising it
You can think of it as like a
muscle that’s atrophied

past a room marked “10 Flashbacks” The door

opens the interior of the room is blurry (like a flashback)

They walk
revealing
stands in

AIMSLEY
Because their fear limits their
freedom-—-

MAX

Actuallyit‘s the combination of

fear distractibility and the
desire to be accepted by others
Remember it all springs from man’s
need for security

past a door marked “11 Infinity” It opens
an endless progression of doors inside A staffer

front of the doors

STAFFER
(to himself)
Where are my keys

AIMSLEY
Yeah But what about a major life--

MAX
Major lives are different They use
much more of their free will With
a major life you have to think more
in terms of the moment

AIMSLEY
The moment

Max puts away the chart Two serious-looking staffers wearing
stupid-looking hats emerge from a door marked “12 Nonsense”

MAX

Most ordinary humans avoid the
moment They dwell on the past or
the future or drink a beer But
the masterpieces - those rare
people are all about being in the
moment each moment They have
Presence

AIMSLEY
Presence I see

They pass “13 Supply Closet” A man emerges with a Unicorn

MAX
And it’s that presence that brings
other people into the moment with
them It can even inspire the free
will of the more ordinary people
they interact with

AIMSLEY
Aha Hence rewrites and all--

SS — “MAX
In fact in some cases we’ve seen
ordinary people literally override
their own pages after interacting
with a major life It happened to
Michelangelo’s cousin Thats why
there can only be so many major
lives Too many would be disruptive
and could lead to chaos

They pass a door marked “14 Coincidence” A staffer exits
holding a jittering box labelled “Chaos” They don’t notice
MAX (CONT’D)
Now do you understand why you have
to work your way up to pitching a
masterpiece Aimsley

AIMSLEY
Yes
(a long pause)
One last question What would
happen if a life had no pages If
it was all just “in the moment”

This question stops Max dead in his tracks

MAX

It wouldn’t happen It couldn’t
happen It would be way too risky
Remember were talking about
people here They need guidance

(beat)
Every person needs a destiny
Aimsley

Aimsley digests this

A staffer

Max looks
away with”

They stop

Frustrated Aimsley punches the wall

INT UNIVERSITY LECTUREHALL - DAY
Angela is lecturing to her class The room is packed

ANGELA
And so we arrive at the inevitable
question of causation - and the
famous Butterfly Effect the idea
that the flapping of a butterfly’s
wings in say South America can
trigger a tornado on the other side
of the world in China

INT DEPARTMENT OF ORDER MAINTENANCE - CONTINUOUS

Max is standing with a large group of people (from PAs all

the way up to executive producers) Everyone is tense An
order technician stands in front of the group

ORDER TECHNICIAN
- We foundthis in Osaka

He rolls footage of a very old Japanese woman in a rural
village She is juggling a soccer ball like Pele A few
villagers stare in amazement

ORDER TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
Tracing the causal chain
backwards

The footage REWINDS to a clip of a businessman in France
the middle of a corporate presentation using dry-erase

In

markers he undertakes an amazing drawing of female nude His

colleagues are stunned

ORDER TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
These are just a few of the
anomalies we’ve found so far I’1l
spare you the details and skip back
to the highest concentration of
disorder at the apparent source

He rewinds quickly past images of changes involving animals
and weather slowing down finally when he comes to

ORDER TECHNICIAN (CONT’‘D)
The source seems to be in this
town

Paco at Coffee Coffee He is juggling five coffee cups in
front of awestruck customers THEN

a

ANGELAS (0S)
-- then what does this mean for us
Are our choices our actions
really that different from the
butterfly’s After all we’re made
of the same stuff as a butterfly

REWIND TO A euphoric Karen lectures from atop her podium
She leaps off it as she makes a point THEN

ANGELAS (0S)
Perhaps our whole world is
connected this way Maybe the
things we did yesterday and the
choices we make today truly affect
the course of the Universe
tomorrow Perhaps that is destiny
itself

REWIND TO Paul finishing up his speech at dinner As he and
Angela speak their script pages FADE UP on screen

PAUL SCRIPT PAGE
Lets do it We’ll throw some Let’s do it We’ll throw some
stuff in a suitcase and just stuff in a suitcase and just

But I really don’t feel manic

AIMSLEY
Of course you don’t That’s part of

something Things may be messed up
right now and maybe I’m feeling a

really just a mutual deficiency
between two people It’s called
uh Mutual deficiency effect
syndrome

WILL
Why not

AIMSLEY
It’s not your destiny Will

the Universe isn’t that simple
Please I want you to live And I
don’t want anything to happen to

possible future events Chaos disaster danger

My God
AIMSLEY

I’m sorry Will I’m not trying to
scare you I’m only trying to help

WILL
Promise me that Angela will be
okay

AIMSLEY
Don’t worry The sooner you set
things straight the sooner she can
return to her destiny and safety
