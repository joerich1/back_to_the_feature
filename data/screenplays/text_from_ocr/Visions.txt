INT BEDROOM -- MORNING
Soft morning light plays on the body of sleeping JESSICA

Dark hair on a pillow Dappled sun on a hip A sheet
hanging on her curves as she turns

We are tight on her as she slowly wakes a languorous arm
stretching over her head--

--and smearing the white pillow case red as it passes

Jessica stops waking up -- blinking at the crimson stains
with sleepy eyes

She looks at her hand It is wet with fresh blood

Jessica sits up with a start -- and stares at the bed

The entire sheet under her is stained scarlet

The bloodstain is growing spreading up the bed towards her
Jessica SCREAMS--

--as she wakes up with a start in her sun-drenched bedroom
Unnerved she looks down at her sheets

Clean White No blood

cur TO

INT BATHROOM -- MORNING

JESSICA SPIRES -- 27 dark hair urbane -- splashes cold
water on her face trying to shake off the dream

She stops and looks in the mirror taking a deep breath
steadying herself

Jessica notices that some of her cosmetics and moisturizers
are on the floor

She picks them up and puts them back on the counter

INT FOYER -- MORNING

Jessica digs through her luggage stacked by the front door
The house around her is ultra-modern The foyer opens up
into a wide-open living space High ceilings Sleek clean-
lined furniture The walls mostly glass

Through the oversized windows we see rolling vineyards

Jessica finds what she is looking for pulling out a copy of
What to Expect When You Are Expecting

IN THE KITCHEN

Gleaming stainless steel appliances ring a butcher block
cooking station Chef skillets hang from a rack above

Breakfast on a tray is waiting for her fresh fruit
croissants steaming coffee in a warming carafe A small
vase holds delicate wild flowers

Jessica smiles as she plucks a note from the tray

“Good morning Sleepyhead We’re in the north vineyard
Love D”

ON THE DECK
Jessica leafs through her book as she sips her juice

Behind her the morning mist burns off golden green rolling
hills

She stops at an entry on bad dreams during pregnancy

cut TO

EXT VINEYARDS -- DAY

Jessica moves through rows of trellised vines green shoots
twist upward from gnarled trunks their first delicate buds
starting to flower

A sun hat shades her face She breathes in the rich smell of
the turned earth Enjoying the chittering sounds of birds
the breeze on her face--

--when a deep THUMPING shatters the sweet stillness
Following the sound she climbs to a crest in the vineyard--
--just in time to see a pick-up truck speeding down the road

bordering their property Its speakers THROB with heavy
bass
Jessica watches the truck until its brake lights kick on --
and it turns down the driveway of the neighboring property

cur TO

A SHARP CURVED BLADE
--as its glinting metal CUTS through tender sprouting vines

DAVID (0S)
It doesn’t feel right killing them
like this

We pull back to see DAVID SPIRES 33 bearded and a touch
fleshy but with glittering eyes and a dynamism to him
kneeling in the loamy soil pruning knife in hand

HAL 53 his weathered vineyard manager picks up a heaping
handful of the rich dark dirt

HAL
We need the land to express itself
in the fruit Less clusters means
more flavor

DAVID
Makes me nervous reducing the yield
like this

HAL

You’re the new kid on the block

David Your goal is to make one

great bottle Let them know who

you are Worry about yield once

you’ve made a name for yourself
(beat)

Looks like we have a visitor

Jessica approaches through the flowering vines
David and Jessica embrace without saying a word

They hug each other tight for a long beat then pull back
still holding hands

JESSICA
Hi Hal

Hal always the gentleman doffs his hat in greeting--

HAL
Welcome back Jessica
She take a breath -- trying to let it go She surveys the
blooming vineyard vines twisting around their trellises

JESSICA
Looks good honey

DAVID
We’re already getting bud break in
the warm patches

HAL
Which need our attention

DAVID
Right No rest for the wicked
(gathering his tools)
Hey I invited some folks over
tonight Thought we should
celebrate you being up here full-
time now You can try out some of
the new recipes for the cookbook
(noticing her hesitation)
What

JESSICA
Nothing I just didn’t sleep well
Bad dreams

DAVID
That doesn’t sound fun

JESSICA
The book says its normal “natural
expression of normal anxieties”

Jessica hesitates -- but she can see how much he wants to
entertain

JESSICA (CONT’D)
What time are they coming

DAVID
Eight

HAL
(glancing at the sky)
We need to get busy pruning the
north slope while we still have
light

DAVID
You okay getting back down
JESSICA
Stop worrying Go

EXT FIELDS -- DAY

Wind ripples through the shaggy field as Jessica kneels down
clipping wild herbs filling her basket Spring flowers
surround her

She pushes into the tangled chaparral to snip a lupine--

--and from this vantage can just see the property next door

Curious she pushes away some of the thick brush getting a
better view

Down below she sees an OLD FARMHOUSE its weathered siding
showing its age

The pick-up truck she saw earlier is parked outside

The barn door suddenly opens and a MAN staggers out A
breathing mask with cannisters covers his face

The man falls to his knees and rips the mask off coughing
violently

He is a large man with a full beard and shaved head Tattoos
cover his arms

Coughing under control the bearded man puts the mask on
again and heads back inside the old barn

Jessica stares not sure what she just witnessed

cur TO

INT KITCHEN -- LATER

Jessica places tomato slices on olive oil-coated bread
sprinkles them with cheese and puts a tray of bruschetta into
the oven

The counter is laden with fresh vegetables and loaves of
bread She is preparing a feast

She cleans as she goes loading bowls into the full
dishwasher then closing it and clicking it to run
Jessica turns to the moving box marked “KITCHEN” She digs
past her pepper mills tins of spices -- until she finds what
she wants

She unwraps a CERAMIC PIG wearing a chef’s hat The pig
holds a rolling pin The base reads “The Chef is Always
Right”

Jessica places the pig on the ledge over her sink She
smiles at her old friend

She pours herself a glass of water at the sink The wide
picture window looks out towards the front of the house

The long gravel driveway is now obscured by twilight gloom
A wreath of bony eucalyptus branches bends in the wind--

--when she hears a soft high-pitched WHISTLING

Jessica turns to the dishwasher and sees that it’s ajar
Frustrated Jessica jams the dishwasher closed again Yet
the soft WHISTLING continues She shoves it harder trying
to make it stop--

RIINNGG -- her cooking timer goes off making her jump

Jessica hurries to the stove and pulls out the tray of
bruschetta

cur TO

EXT WINERY -- EVENING

Jessica follows the dirt path connecting their house to the
refurbished barn that serves as the winery

She carries a steaming tray of food with her
INSIDE THE WINERY

She passes gleaming fermenting tanks hosing and aging
barrels all awaiting grapes

David and Hal are sitting on barrels drinking beer as they
pick dirt out of their boot soles

DAVID
Hey sweetie

He kisses her as she offers them bruschetta
JESSICA
Try these What do you think of
the sage

DAVID
(trying one)
Fantastic Seriously Make sure
you serve them to Helena Knoll
tonight

JESSICA
Who’s she

HAL
Top buyer in town I can’t believe
you invited her

DAVID
Thought it’d be a good way to get
on her good side

HAL
Didn’t know she had a good side

DAVID
If I can get on her shelves we’re
more than halfway there And I
figure Jess’s cooking is my secret
weapon

David pulls her close as he eats another bruschetta

JESSICA
Is someone new living in the old
Cherry place

DAVID
Yeah The old man died last month
I forgot to tell you His sons
there now Larry

HAL
No Leo

JESSICA
What’s his deal

DAVID
Dont really know too much about
him We hear him partying every
now and then Thats about it
Why
JESSICA
I saw him when I was picking herbs
He washe had a mask on -- I

don’t know what he was doing

DAVID
Whatever it was it’s none of our
business

curt TO

A BOTTLE BEING UNCORKED

--as David entertains a crowd of DINNER GUESTS at a long
candlelit table littered with bottles of wine bowls of
olives and plates of cheese

DAVID
You must try the salami with the
Lambrusco It’s like discovering a
new religion

Guests laugh and smile caught up in David’s exuberance
Bottles are passed around Warm laughter and conversation
cloak the outdoor table with cheer

Jessica carries a tray of roasted figs around to appreciative
guests They burble with praise complimenting her cooking

She offers the platter to HELENA KNOLL 61 a heavy-set woman
with salt-and-pepper hair and bulging eyes Helena sits by
herself observing the merriment from a distance

JESSICA
Would you like to try the roasted
figs Helena They’re a staple at
Cocobelle

HELENA
(brusque)
I appreciate the effort Jessica
I’ll taste your husbands wine when
its ready It makes the shelves
if its good not whether I like
your figs or not

JESSICA
I didn’t mean to--
HELENA
Of course not Now what I would
love is another glass of that Opus
David just opened

Jessica gets the bottle and refills Helena’s glass She
swirls and sniffs before drinking Purrs with pleasure

HELENA (CONT’D)
Come Have a seat Let me have a
look at you

Jessica sits down Helena peers at her with piercing bulging
eyes

HELENA (CONT’D)
The Porters who were here before

you -- they were never serious
about the wine This house they
built the vineyards -- it was all

just dress-up for them Just one
more thing for them to buy with all
that dirty money of theirs

Helena reaches out and takes Jessica’s hand in hers holding
it tight -- as if feeling for something

HELENA (CONT’D)
But not you two No not you Am
I right

JESSICA
(unnerved)
I’m not sure what you want me to
say

Helena keeps holding onto Jessica’s hand concentrating

HELENA
You and David You want to make it
work I can feel how much you want
it

JESSICA
When David was a sommelier all he
ever wanted to be doing was making
his own wine

HELENA
I’m not talking about the wine

Jessica stares at Helena caught off-guard--

--when VICTOR NAPOLI 67 an older gracious man chimes his
wine glass standing to make a toast Everyone quiets down

VICTOR
We are here tonight to welcome
David and Jessica to this valley
In honor of that I have brought a
very special bottle with me

Victor lifts an old dusty bottle the label aged and worn

VICTOR (CONTD)
This is a bottle of Ruston ‘89
That’s 1889 not 1989 It’s one of
the first bottles made from the
fruit of this valley Some of the
vines from this very ridge Some
still growing today

Victor circles the table filling everyone’s glass

JESSICA
Just a touch please

Done he raises his glass to all Fireflies buzz lazily over
the fields

VICTOR

They say wine is an expression of
the land It is soil and air and
time It is also us Our labor
and love lives on in these bottles
as well Tonight I want to welcome
another wine soul to the valley
Let us drink in the past as we
embrace the future

(he lifts his glass)
Welcome David and Jessica May
you bless these fields And may
these fields bless you Salud

ALL

(lifting their glasses)
Salud

INT KITCHEN -- A BIT LATER

Jessica slices watermelon as her old friend EILEEN 34 sips
wine She watches David out on the deck regaling guests
with stories

EILEEN
I see leaving the restaurant
business hasn’t dulled his social
skills

Jessica glances out at her husband Attractive FEMALE GUESTS
lean in as they laugh at his jokes

JESSICA
Let him have his fun My God all
he has for company up here is Hal
and those vines

EILEEN
You’re not worried After what
happened in LA

Jessica’s knife cuts through the red flesh of the melon

JESSICA
(a little too firmly)
That’s over That’s why we’re
here To start again

EILEEN
So you guys are good

JESSICA
Really good David’s doing what he
loves He’s never been happier

HELENA
Bathroom

JESSICA
Down the hall Second door on your
left

Helena staggers on Jessica turns back to Eileen

EILEEN
I still can’t believe you’re having
a baby

JESSICA

It’s so nuts It’s not like we
planned it or anything I mean
it’s kind of a crazy time to do it
with all that’s going on But hey
everything happens for a reason
right It’s so good for David
For us

--when they hear a strange CRY and then a thudding CRASH from
down the hall

We race with Jessica and Eileen down the hallway Jessica is
the first one into--

THE BATHROOM

--where Helena is convulsing on the floor

Her mouth is bloody from where she hit it on the sink
Bright red blood smears the tiled floor

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Ch my God

Jessica gets down on her knees to help Helena She holds her
tight trying to keep her from hurting herself any more

HELENA
(struggling to speak)
My bagpills

EILEEN
I’ll get it

Eileen leaves as Helena reaches for Jessica with grasping
hands clutching at her spittle flecking her mouth

JESSICA
It’s okay You’re going to be
okay

Jessica stares into Helena’s crazed eyes They are full of
fear--

--when David Victor and Eileen come rushing in Other
guests hover in the hall

DAVID
Holy shit

Eileen digs out a vial of prescription pills Victor helps
her give them to Helena forcing her to swallow

Jessica backs away her hands protectively covering her
stomach

DISSOLVE TO

INT BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Jessica sits in bed She absently holds a pair of knitting
needles A book of baby clothing patterns forgotten on her
lap

Lights reflect through the window playing on the ceiling as
a car pulls into the driveway

Jessica hears the door open -- and David soon enters

JESSICA
How is she

DAVID
Fine

David flops on the bed exhausted

JESSICA
What caused it

DAVID
She said something about the
figs

JESSICA

(kicking him)
No seriously

DAVID
She didnt say Just said thank
you for the lift and sent us home
Hal was right about her

David holds onto her leg rubbing his hand up her thigh
inching higher She pulls away

DAVID (CONT’D)
Come on The number one wine buyer
in the valley just had a seizure at
my first party I need some
loving

JESSICA
Let me just go to the bathroom

DAVID
I’1l be waiting

JESSICA
(smirks gets up)
Be right back
IN THE BATHROOM

Jessica sits on the toilet

From this new angle -- she notices a few drops of blood on
the counter tile that she missed earlier

Jessica wets some toilet paper and reaches over to scrub the
tile clean--

--when there is a SOFT KNOCKING at the door
JESSICA (CONT’D)
Hold your horses I’m going to the
bathroom

Jessica finishes up and flushes as she pulls up her boxers

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Okay Come in

The door stays shuts -- as Jessica notices that the
moisturizer has slipped off the sink again and is lying on
the ground

She kneels down to pick it up

Jessica puts the lotion back on the counter -- and in the
mirror sees that the bathroom door is now open

JESSICA (CONT’D)
David

Nothing

Jessica steps out into the empty hall

She walks back TO THEIR BEDROOM--

--David is asleep on the bed clothes still on as he snores
DISSOLVE TO

GHOSTLY DISTORTED IMAGES FILLING THE SCREEN

An undulating black-and-white sea of digital imagery comes in
and out of focus Eerie shapes form and re-form pulsating
with a strange life

We PULL BACK from the surreal sea and see that we are looking
at the screen of an ultrasound machine

IN THE DOCTOR’s OFFICE

DR GERALD NATHANSON 42 slides his ultrasound paddle over
Jessica’s stomach The imaging on the screen changing as he
goes

Together he and Jessica stare at the mottled images on the
screen in the dimmed office

DR NATHANSON
Everything looks good Feeling
okay otherwise

JESSICA
Yes Fine I’m up here full-time
now No more going back and forth
to the restaurant Ready to write
that cookbook

DR NATHANSON
Fantastic My wife will be first
in line She and her girlfriends
ate at Cocobelle last time they
were in the city Said it was the
best meal they ever had She
wanted me to tell you to open one
up here

JESSICA
(smiling)
No way The whole point was to get
away from that lifestyle It was
killing us

Dr Nathanson rolls back on his stool and flicks the lights
on He gives Jessica some towels to wipe the gel off her
belly as he makes notes on her file

DR NATHANSON
Any physical problems

JESSICA
Nope A little tired maybe

DR NATHANSON
And how’s being off the lithium
Any issues

JESSICA
None at all

DR NATHANSON
Now that you’re in your second
trimester you could go back on

JESSICA
Not if it might hurt the baby

DR NATHANSON
Well there is your history to
consider

JESSICA
(getting edgy)
That was a long time ago I’m fine
now

DR NATHANSON
Okay Let’s just keep an eye on it
then

He hands her a urine sample cup
DR NATHANSON (CONT’D)
Give it to the nurse on the way

out See you next month

INT YOGA STUDIO -- DAY

YOGA INSTRUCTOR
Feel your breath flow through your
body You are in control of your
own experience

Jessica struggles to follow the limber YOGA INSTRUCTOR She
sweats and grunts feeling very not-Zen

YOGA INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
Lay your mat out now and assume
shivasana position

Jessica lays on her mat trying to get comfortable The
teacher dims the lights and puts on soft new age music

YOGA INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
As we come to the end of our
session I want you to send your
unaysa breath to the child inside
you Speak to your child with your
breath

The Yoga Teacher makes a funny nasal noise as she sends her
breath through her body

All the women in the class make the same funny noise trying
to follow the teacher’s lead

Jessica tries snorting -- when the YOUNG WOMAN next to her
starts to giggle

Jessica looks over at the giggling Young Woman She is
trying to keep it in pressing her lips together

The Pregnant Women continue to make the silly snorting noise

The Young Woman next to Jessica can’t keep it in any longer
She starts to laugh

And Jessica laughs with her The giggles coming up out of
their bellies

All the other woman look at them with disapproval
Jessica continues laughing -- unable to stop

cur TO

INT YOGA STUDIO -- LATER

Jessica and the Young Woman put their shoes back on She is
Jessicas age but crunchier with braided blonde hair and a
wide cherubic face

The other women walk by them giving them a look

JESSICA

here than ruining someones moment
of Zen

YOUNG WOMAN
I think laughter is healthy We
should all try and laugh more It
made you feel better right

JESSICA

Jessica smiles imagining her bright future

SADIE

A BINOCULAR POV

--of the old weathered barn next door to Jessica A drizzly
mist hangs in the air

Jessica kneels in the tangled chaparral binoculars to her
eyes spying on her neighbor

She watches Leo the bald bearded man pace nervously besides
the barn checking his watch -- when he looks up

An SUV with tinted windows makes its way down his driveway

The SUV parks and a MAN with sunglasses gets out He goes
around back and pulls out a tub It sloshes with liquid

Leo hands the man a large wad of cash lifts the tub from the
SUV -- and almost slips Both men freeze with fear

The man in sunglasses cautions him to be careful with
whatever is inside the tub

Leo carefully carries the tub around to the barn and out of
Jessica’s sight

Jessica gets up in the chaparral She quietly pushes through
the brush trying to find a better vantage point

She finds an opening and settles in Binoculars to her eyes--
--she observes Leo opening the barn door
When a branch SNAPS under her

The two men turn at the noise looking for its source The
man with sunglasses POINTS in her general direction

JESSICA
(whispering)
Shit

Jessica backtracks as quickly and quietly as she can not
sure if they saw her or not

IN THE VINEYARD

Jessica hurries through the furrowed rows pushing through
the vines

She looks back towards Leo’s property Nothing but misty
brush

Jessica tries to calm down Maybe it’s nothing Maybe they
didn’t see her

She stops unable to catch her breath -- when she freezes

The entire row of vines is moving by itself shifting ever-so-
slightly as if something were moving through them

Jessica stares at the vines disoriented They are now
utterly still Maybe it was just the wind

Down at the end of the row she sees something bright red
hanging from a vine

She makes her way to the end of the row

Tied to the thick of the vine with red ribbon is a SHINY
PIECE OF METAL

Jessica holds the thin metal wrapped with red ribbon What
is this doing here

--when she sees someone move across the end of the row A
Shadow in the mist

Jessica turns and runs down the row away from the shadow
turning the corner--

--and running into A PICKING CREW They are listening to Hal
and David give them instructions

Jessica runs to David He takes her in his arm confused
She holds him tight The crew stares at her

DAVID
What’s the matter

curt TO

INT KITCHEN - LATER
Jessica paces nervously as David tries to keep his cool

DAVID
What were you even doing spying on
him I told you to steer clear

Outside late afternoon shadows creep across the land

JESSICA
What if they’re making crystal meth
over there

DAVID
Jess you dont know what you saw
It could have been anything

JESSICA
We can’t just do nothing

DAVID
I want you to let it go

Jessica faces her husband sensing his resolve

DAVID (CONT’D)
This is a tricky time for you
Don’t make it worse by getting
involved I don’t want you
anywhere near that place Promise
me

He holds her stare -- until Jessica nods

DAVID (CONT’D)
I’ve got to get back We need to
get everything pinned up while we
have a crew

JESSICA
Do you have to

DAVID
We’re already behind schedule
(sensing her distress)
What is it Jess

JESSICA
What if they did see me

DAVID
(trying to be patient)
Honey everything’s going to be
fine I’m right in the fields
Anything happens just call me

cur TO

THE TELEVISION SCREEN

--where a CRAFTS-LADY demonstrates a knitting stitch She
wears plaid has short grey hair and is very perky

CRAFTS LADY
Once again we put the lower needle
through the loop and pull through
And in no time we will have a
perfect little baby blanket

ON THE COUCH

Jessica tries to repeat the stitch with her own needles
Fails miserably

She has a bowl of ice cream on the coffee table

Jessica rewinds the DVR and repeats the step in slow-motion
She tries it again and hurts her finger jerking away

JESSICA
Shit

Frustrated she turns off the knitting show and turns on
Project Runway

Jessica kicks away the folds of rug gathered by her feet as
she digs into her ice cream

The would-be designers do their thing on the screen
Jessica leans back happy on the couch with her mint chip--

--when she notices that the rug is again bunched up around
her ankle tickling her bare skin

She stares down at the rug its creases almost wrapped around
her ankle -- then kicks it away again

IN THE KITCHEN
Jessica rinses out her bowl in the sink

On the window ledge the ceramic chef pig wields his rolling
pin watching her

Outside the big window over the sink it is inky dark in the
cloudy country night

Jessica turns on NPR to keep her company as she cleans up
Neal Conant hosts Talk of the Nation

She can see the glow of a set of headlights making its way
along the road leading past their house

As it comes closer the headlight beams cut through the trees
illuminating the long driveway out in front--

--and shine on a lone HOODED FIGURE standing at the edge of
the driveway

The Hooded Fiqure stands utterly still under a live oak Its
face is hidden

The headlights pass and the driveway is plunged back into
darkness

Jessica stares into the black Nervous Frozen
The water runs in the sink Neal Conant chats away
When another car slowly comes down the road

Its headlights pass by illuminating the same live oak -- and
there is no one there

Jessica turns on the porch lights But they barely light up
the front Only accentuating the darkness beyond

As she stares out the window into the black Jessica fumbles
for her phone punching numbers

It RINGS -- Jessica stares into the dark It RINGS again

DAVID (0S)
Jess

cut TO

EXT DRIVEWAY -- LATER
David and Jessica edge down the dark driveway together

He holds a heavy flashlight in one hand shining its beam
into the wet murk a baseball bat in the other Jessica
looks around nervously as they go

DAVID
What did he look like

JESSICA
It was hard to tell There was a
hood over his face

They move closer to the oak tree Jessica looks around

DAVID
Was it either of the men you saw
next door

JESSICA
I don’t know I just saw him for a
second

They reach the oak tree David shines his beam all around
Nothing

DAVID
Right here

Jessica nods
David shines the beam down on the ground examining the mud
The dark earth crawls with worms He sees his and Jessica’s

footsteps in the wet ground -- and nothing else

DAVID (CONT’D)
You sure

JESSICA
Yes I’m sure
David takes a deep breath

DAVID
Jess there are no footprints here
except ours If there was someone
here they would have left prints
in the mud

JESSICA
What So you’re saying there was
no one here That I made it up

DAVID
Maybe there’s another explanation

JESSICA
Don’t look at me like that

He turns and looks back down pained

DAVID
I’m just sayingyou’re off your
drugs I know you don’t like to
talk about it but who--

JESSICA
I know what I saw

INT RESTAURANT -- DAY

curt TO

Jessica and Sadie sit in an organic restaurant their yoga

mats rolled up under their chairs

SADIE
You probably just scared whoever it
was off and the rain washed away
his prints

JESSICA
I swear I saw someone

SADIE
The point is you need to do
something The chemicals they use
are highly toxic There could be
fumes or run-off into your water
It could harm the baby And you
guys are all alone out there

SADIE (CONTD)
You dont want all the riff-raff a
meth lab attracts running around
your property Who knows when
they’1l need some extra cashor
worse

JESSICA
Okay stop it youre scaring me

Sadie leans in intent

SADIE
Its up to you David doesn’t get
it like we do He doesn’t have a
baby inside him You are the
lioness protecting the cub
Rrroooarr

Sadie ROARS loud enough for other diners to take notice

SADIE (CONT’D)
Let me hear you roar

JESSICA
(embarrassed)
Roar
SADIE
Not bad

(flags down a waitress)
We need another order of the
chocolate mousse

JESSICA
No I can’t eat another bite

SADIE
It’ll do you good A lioness needs
her strength

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

Jessica drives home along the narrow winding road to her
house--

--when she slows the car pulling to the side
She peers down the long unkempt driveway to Leo’s property

A rusting mailbox with the name CHERRY on it The old
farmhouse obscured by brush and trees

Jessica stares -- but there’s nothing to see
She pulls back onto the road

cut TO

EXT HOUSE -- LATER

Jessica steps out of her car and approaches the front door--
--and notices that it is slightly ajar

She pushes the door open and steps

INTO THE FOYER

Jessica stops and looks around The house is silent

As she puts her car keys down on the foyer table she notices
a few coins are standing on their edges

Jessica stops peering at the coins for a moment -- before
she takes a step further in--

--and sees a partial wet boot print on the gleaming marble
flocr

JESSICA

Nothing

Jessica moves deeper into the silent shadowy house looking
around with caution

The door to their bedroom at the end of the hall is open
All the other room doors are closed

Jessica slowly steps down the hall The house is still She
hesitates at the threshold--

--before stepping INTO THE BEDROOM

Where the drawers have been pulled out of the dresser

Books and magazines lie scattered on the floor

The sheets and blankets on the bed twisted and rumpled

Jessica stares at her ransacked bedroom with shock

cut TO

Jessica rushes into the winery -- where David is dipping his
glass thief into one of the oversized oak barrels pulling
out a sample of wine

LEO CHERRY steps cut of the shadows towards her He holds
something sharp and glinting in his hand

Jessica steps back

LEO

bathroom Sorry

Jessica sees that he is holding the jagged stem of a wine
glass She turns to David losing it

DAVID

Leo puts down the shard of wine glass He turns to Jessica
with a sheepish smile embarrassed

LEO

Jessica says nothing as she heads down the hall David
follows after her

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DRIVE WAY -- DAY
Jessica pulls up to the gleaming modern house
The soft afternoon sun reflects on the window walls

She pops the trunk and pulls out bags of groceries

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Jessica unlocks the front door and steps into the foyer
juggling groceries

She puts a bag of produce down on the floor as she drops the
car keys and her loose change on the foyer table

We follow her OUTSIDE as she returns to her car to get the
rest of the bags

Jessica pulls more bags out of the back using her knees to
hoist them all up in her arms

She hurries back to the house balancing her bags trying to
keep the baguettes from falling out as she goes

Jessica steps back into the house pushing the door closed
with her foot -- when she suddenly stops

A few of the coins she left on the foyer table are now
standing on their edges -- all in a iine

Jessica peers at the coins as she puts down the groceries

JESSICA
David

Nothing

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Hal

The house is empty
Jessica stares at the balancing coins

INT KITCHEN -- LATER

Jessica is hard at work She dresses a chicken spreading a
lemon olive tapenade under its seasoned skin

The music is on soft indie on her iPod speakers

She cleans as she goes rinsing out dishes and loading them
into the dishwasher before moving on

Jessica notes measurements Her apron is smeared Her hands
greasy She is in her element

When the iPod starts skipping

Jessica wipes her hands to go deal with it She turns it
off

The big modern kitchen is suddenly quiet

In the stillness Jessica hears that same high-pitched
WHISTLING Like before only louder now

She stops Turns and looks at the dishwasher The door is
open the racks half-loaded

Jessica slowly turns around looking for the source of the
ethereal sound

She can’t find it anywhere -- then peers up at the central
air heating vent

IN THE LIVING ROOM
Still in her messy apron Jessica steps to the thermostat

She turns the heat off -- when she hears another sound Very
soft strange and distorted -- but human

Jessica slowly turns and stares at her empty house She
peers up into its modern corners trying to find the source

It sounds like it’s coming from down the hall

Jessica moves towards the source

As she gets closer she can begin to make out the sound
Itsounds like a WOMAN CRYING

Jessica stops at the door to the guest bedroom The soft
distorted CRYING sounds like it’s coming from inside

She slowly opens the door
The room is empty Full of unpacked moving boxes--

--when her cell phone sharply RINGS Jessica JUMPS -- before
picking up

JESSICA

EXT HOUSE -- TWILIGHT
Shadows creep across the driveway as the day winds down

The sharp modern contours of the house now in silhouette as
the sun falls behind the ridge

INSIDE

Jessica sits at the counter laptop open She types in the
name PORTER and their address Google pulls up links

She clicks through All of them are business articles about
Mr Porter’s embezzlement of pension funds

David steps into the kitchen refilling his drink

JESSICA
How much do you know about the
Porters

DAVID

Not much They built the house and
then he got busted for embezzling
pensions Why

JESSICA
Dont you want to know who else
lived here besides us

DAVID
No not really What’s up

JESSICA
(closing the computer)
Nothing I’m going to bed
DAVID
Full night’s sleep will do you
well Goodnight sweetie

David watches her go

cur TO

INT BATHROOM -- LATER

In boxers and T-shirt Jessica brushes her teeth Through
the door she can just hear the sound of David watching TV in
the den

Done she lathers up with cleanser scrubbing her face
Jessica reaches down into the sink to rinse her face clean

She looks back up and stops--

--in the mirror’s reflection she sees that the bathroom door
is now open

Jessica slowly turns and stares at the empty bathroom

IN THE BEDROOM

Jessica lies in bed playing solitaire on her laptop The
light of her computer screen casts a dim pale glow over the
dark room

She can still hear the sound of David watching TV down the
hall She pushes away the sheets bunched against her
computer trying to get comfortable

Jessica focuses on her game trying to wind down--

--when she sees the sheets push up against the back of the
laptop again

Jessica stops playing staring at the rumpled sheets in the
dim LED glow--

--when the bedroom door suddenly SLAMS closed

Jessica freezes alone in the dark silent room The faint
glow of her computer only accenting the shadows--

--when in the quiet she hears DRIP DRIP DRIP Wet droplets
right near her

DRIP DRIP DRIP
Jessica slowly reaches over and flips on her reading light--

--and sees that her white sheets are slathered in blood

Thick red blood spreads across the sheets below her The
stain growing larger and larger moving towards her

JESSICA
No

Jessica recoils from the blood scrambling out of bed
backing away with horror --

--when she trips falling over the drawers of her dresser now
all open behind her

Jessica gets to her knees crazed turning around back
towards the bloody bed--

--and sees a hand slowly reach up from the far side of the
bed

The hand claws at the sheets pulling itself up--

--as Jessica sees the head of a SHADOWY FIGURE slowly rise
over the lip of the bed long wet stringy hair hiding its
face

Jessica SCREAMS as she crawls madly away flinging open the
door out of the bedroom--

--just as David RUSHES down the hall towards her
He grabs her holding her
JESSICA (CONT’D)
(crazed)
There’s someone in there

Together they turn and look back into the bedroom

It’s clean The sheets rumpled but no blood Her laptop
lies on the floor butterflied the only sign of disturbance

Jessica pushes past David

She touches the bed -- then takes a breath and looks on the
other side where she saw the figure

Nothing The room is empty except for the two of them
She turns back to David
He stares at her with concern

DISSOLVE TO

THE VINEYARDS

--where fog sits heavy on the ridges A few drops fall on
the hungry vines the dark fruit growing

IN THE CAR

David drives Jessica beside him looking out the window
They say nothing The stormy sky reflected in the
windshield

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- DAY

A kindly Dr Nathanson looks at an uncomfortable David and
Jessica sitting across from him in his office

DR NATHANSON
And have you experienced any of
these things that Jessica’s
described

DAVID
Never

DR NATHANSON
And you’ve been living in the house
for how long now

DAVID
Nearly a year Jess has been
coming up on her days off from the
restaurant

DR NATHANSON
(to Jessica)
And you never experienced any of
this until just recently when you
moved up here permanently
JESSICA
Yes

DR NATHANSON
So these experiences in the house
started once you became pregnant

JESSICA
Uh huh

Dr Nathanson checks Jessica’s file once more before
proceeding

DR NATHANSON
First of all what you’re telling
me isn’t out of the ordinary in the
least Many women have sat in that
very chair and told me quite
amazing things During pregnancy a
lot of women find that their senses
are heightened Smell Taste
Other senses too It’s a very
trying time both physically and
emotionally The most important
thing is that both you and the baby
are physically just fine

JESSICA
It’s just my head you’re worried
about

Dr Nathanson pauses before continuing

DR NATHANSON

We can’t ignore your medical
history Jessica If these
incidents continue or increase in
severity I would suggest you
consider going back on the lithium
You’re past your first trimester
now The risks are greatly

reduced

JESSICA
But the drugs could still hurt the
baby

DR NATHANSON
Yes there are risks Life is
nothing but risk

JESSICA
Easy for you to say when it’s not
your baby

DAVID
Jess

DR NATHANSON
You’re right It’s your decision
I just want you to be aware of your
options What we all want to avoid
is a point where you’re at risk of
hurting yourself -- or your child

DAVID
Agreed

DR NATHANSON
And if I could offer some non-
medical advice try and relax
Socialize go out get your mind
off it Worrying often makes these
things worse

A CORKSCREW TURNING INTO A CORK

--as we pull back to see David opening a bottle of wine
Sadie and BEN 27 her strapping boyfriend with short hair
and John Lennon glasses sit at the deck table in the soft

candlelight The sun sets over the vineyards

David pulls the cork and decants the wine swirling it a bit

DAVID
Let’s just give it a few moments to
open up

platter of baby lamb chops ringed with fingerling potatoes
from the kitchen

David pours the wine Sadie puts a hand over her glass

rinses The bony trees dark silhouettes in the moonlight

Just a little hot

DAVID

She tosses him the wet dish towel as an answer
IN THE SHOWER
Hot water steams the stall

Jessica leans against the slick shower tile letting the
water pour over her--

--when there is a KNOCK at the door

JESSICA
Leave me be David

The KNOCKING continues

JESSICA (CONT’D)
I’m really not in the mood

--when she hears the bathroom door slowly open

Jessica turns and through the steamy curtain -- sees a
Shadowy figure on the other side

It’s not David

Jessica freezes Through the fog she sees the shadowy figure
move past the curtain and across the bathroom

Jessica backs up against the tile of the shower stall--
--when she hears something CLATTER to the ground by the sink

Jessica hugs the back wall of the shower The bathroom is
silent except for the sound of the flowing water--

--when the shadow moves right in front of the steamed
curtain

VOICE (0S)

Jessica moves back as far as she can -- and watches as a hand
slowly pushes on the curtain reaching for her

Jessica reaches forward -- and RIPS open the shower curtain

There’‘s no one there

Steam fills the empty bathroom as Jessica steps out of the
shower

She turns surveying the room Nothing but steam A few
bottles of cosmetics and moisturizer are knocked over on the
floor

Jessica backs up feeling for the door and stepping out--

INTO THE HALLWAY

hurrying away from the bathroom

The tickling continues

Jessica looks down--

reaching up fingers wrapping around her ankle

She JERKS back from the carpet

KICKS the rug away

Jessica slowly turns looking through the big window over the
sink

At the end of the driveway is the HOODED FIGURE
Jessica can see it shrouded in the foggy moonlight
Its face hidden Its dark cloak sodden

The Hooded Figure starts walking Slowly steadily

It passes by the window and out of sight -- heading right for

Drops of red blood drip onto the counter

Frustrated she puts pressure on her finger -- when she hears
a strange FLAPPING sound

Jessica freezes She turns off the iPod listening

There is a soft FLAPPING and BANGING coming from the back
pantry She stares at the closed door

Jessica takes a deep breath slowly opens the door and steps--

Blades out gently prying the clusters from their vines
dropping them into brimming plastic bins

David and Hal supervising as bin after bin is loaded into the
waiting truck

The machines noisily CHURNING as the grapes are crushed

Ripe fruit ground down as the precious juice spills and spits

INT POST OFFICE -- LATER

Jessica waits in line still rattled by her encounter with
Sadie -- when the weathered female CLERK calls the next
customer

She goes to the window and hands the Clerk a package

CLERK
Do you want to send it priority

JESSICA
No just regular mail is fine

The Clerk notices the return address on the package as she
prints out the mailing label

CLERK
Wait here

Confused Jessica waits as the Clerk leaves the window and
disappears into the back

Impatient people in line glare as if it were her fault

The Clerk returns and hands Jessica a box from Amazon

CLERK (CONT’D)
This is for you We sent out
slips but no one ever picked it
up Been gathering dust back
there

Jessica looks at it The package is made out to Jane Porter

JESSICA
This isn’t mine

CLERK
That your address

JESSICA
Yes

CLERK

It’s yours now

INT CAR -- LATER
Jessica gets into her car with her groceries

She looks over and sees the Amazon box sitting on the seat
next to her

Curious she starts tearing open the cardboard packing
There’s a book inside She pulls it out

Jessica stares at the title -- Poltergeists Examining
Mysteries of the Paranormal

Jessica waits She looks at the creepy cover of
Poitergeists

JANE PORTER (0S)

JESSICA

Jessica takes a breath then continues

JESSICA
Did you ever experience anything
strange while you were here

JANE PORTER Excuse me

JESSICA
I was at the post office and they
gave me the book you ordered from
Amazon on poltergeistsand I

JANE PORTER (0S)
I can’t talk to you Goodb--

JESSICA
Wait Please don’t hang up

There is a long pause on the other end

JANE PORTER (cautious formal)
I’m currently in divorce
proceedings with my husband

JANE PORTER (CONTD)
Therefore it is very important
that I present myself in the proper
light He’ll try anything to
discredit me make me look crazy

EXT VINEYARDS -- LATER
Jessica hikes up through the vineyards behind their house
She has the poltergeist book in hand

Two PICKERS carry plastic tubs of late-harvest grapes on
their shoulders down to the winery

JESSICA
Excuse me do you know where David
is El Jefe
They point up the slope
FARTHER UP THE SLOPE
The row is narrow the vines redolent with late growth
Breathing hard now Jessica hurries book in hand--

--when she trips stumbling to the ground

Jessica looks down and sees a vine snaked around her ankle
almost as if it grabbed her

She peels the vine off her skin -- when behind her she hears
a strange RUSTLING sound

Jessica slowly turns around -- and freezes

The vines are all moving on their own as if something is
pushing through them coming towards her

The stalks twisting and shaking all around her
Jessica stares The vines are alive

cur TO

INT BATHROOM -- LATER

Jessica gathers up all of the lithium needles
She shoves them into a plastic garbage bag
OUTSIDE

She carries the bag to the trash bin happily dumping them
into the trash can--

--when she sees David returning from the vineyard

DAVID
You were looking for me

Jessica turns to him thrilled

JESSICA
It’s not me It’s the house

DAVID
What are you talking about

JESSICA
There’s something here The
Porters -- that’s why they left
They felt something in the house
too

She shows him the poltergeist book

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Jane Porter ordered this book --
they were holding it for her at the
post office Then when I called
her she basically admitted it then
she got all weird and hung up on
me
DAVID
(confused)
You called Jane Porter Jess
what are you doing

JESSICA
It’s the house We don’t have to
risk hurting the baby

David notices the bag of needles in the trash

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Don’t you see -- it’s not me It’s
not me

DAVID
Wait hold onlets be rational
for a second

JESSICA
I am being rational

DAVID
Slow down Jane Porter got a book
on ghosts who knows for what
reason And then you called her up
bugging her about it and she was a
little weird which I might be too
if someone I didn’t know started
calling me asking about ghosts
And because of that you think the
house is haunted

JESSICA
I thought you’d be happy

DAVID
Calm down

JESSICA
Don’t tell me to calm down

DAVID
Lets just not jump to any
conclusions I mean this is no
reason to go off the medication
Things have been going so well

JESSICA
I won’t hurt our baby

DAVID
That’s not what I’m saying

David collects the needles back out of the trash

DAVID (CONT’D)
We need to do what’s best for--

Jessica slaps the needles out of David’s hands They scatter
across the ground

JESSICA
No more shots

David looks at her exasperated as he gathers up the
needles She backs away from him

JESSICA (CONT’D)
I’ll prove it to youI will

INT HELENA’S WINE SHOP -- DAY

Jessica moves past the blonde wood racks stacked with local
wines to the back counter where Helena is busy tasting

A nervous WINE MAKER watches Helena swish the wine in her
mouth before spitting it out into a bucket

Helena says nothing as she repeats the swirl swish and spit
on the next bottle

A mottled cat on the counter stares at Jessica with
unblinking yellow eyes

HELENA
(to Wine Maker)
No thank you I suggest you come
back when you learn the meaning of
balance

The Wine Maker slinks away as Helena turns to Jessica
HELENA (CONT’D)
Jessica my my what brings you
here in such a flurry
Jessica gathers herself
JESSICA

That night you were at my house
You felt something didnt you

HELENA
I just had a bit too much to drink
That’s all

JESSICA
No The way you touched my hand
you knew about me and David You
sensed it There was something in
the bathroom wasn’t there

Helena takes a long pause petting her cat before looking up
at Jessica with those bulging eyes

HELENA
I have what they call a sensitive
soul I can feel see things a bit
more than others Makes for a
great palette When I drink wine --
I feel the grapes the weather the
soil The same goes for people and
places Most of the time it’s
stuff that passes other folks by
So I let it go Usually best that
way Apparently it hasn’t passed
you by

JESSICA
What did you feel in my house

HELENA
(takes a deep breath)
First it was just a dark vibe But
then in the bathroom it was
stronger Much stronger Anger
and fear And then you Jessica
You were there with me

JESSICA
Will you come back over I need to
know what it is what it wants so
I can get rid of it

HELENA
Jessica I don’t really do that
kind of thing

JESSICA
(desperate)
I need to know what’s happening in
my house
HELENA

Well Im actually tasting up in
the valley tomorrow afternoon
Would that work

JESSICA
Yes Anytime

HELENA
Okay Around three

JESSICA

Around three See you then Thank
you Helena

EXT HELENA’S WINE SHOP -- DAY

Jessica steps out of the shop relieved

cur TO

She walks to where her car is parked along the town commons --

when she freezes

We follow Jessica’s stare across the town square to the front

of the main hotel

There is a man with a REDHEADED WOMAN From behind the man

looks just like David

The man and woman walk out of the hotel She laughs her
face hidden by branches The man touches her arm as he helps

her into an SUV
A bus drives by blocking Jessicas view

When it moves on they’re gone Jessica scans
she can’t find the man anywhere

She hurries along the sidewalk trying to get a better view--

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Jessica sits on the couch alone watching TV

She barely pays attention to Tom Cruise in Top Gun her mind
elsewhere--

a tie and shirt with his jeans -- just like the man she saw
earlier

DAVID
Hey sweetie

JESSICA
Hi

He comes over and kisses her on top of the head

DAVID
How you doing

JESSICA
Fine Where were you today I
tried to call you

DAVID
Yeah I was down in the Edna Valley
checking out some barrels Must
have been no reception Anyway
this guy makes them himself with
Hungarian Oak I think I might use
them for the red blend

JESSICA
You were there all day

DAVID
Pretty much

Jessica stares at him saying nothing -- as he sits besides
her getting comfortable

He reaches over and tries to rub her back

DAVID (CONT’D)

Jessica moves away from his touch He looks at her

They sit in silence in front of the television

INT HOUSE KITCHEN -- THE NEXT DAY

Jessica paces biting her nails Recipe notes and
ingredients lie forgotten on the butcher block

She glances at the clock It is nearly three
When her cell phone suddenly RINGS cutting the silence

JESSICA
Hello

There is only RASPING on the other end

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Hello

More RASPING and HEAVY BREATHING

Unnerved by the strange sounds on the line Jessica is about
to hang up -- when the RASPING becomes a LABORED VOICE

VOICE

JESSICA
Who is this

--when a loud CAR HORN suddenly sounds Unending Right
nearby

Jessica turns to the window over the sink -- and sees a SAAB
stopped halfway down her driveway horn BLARING

EXT DRIVE WAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Jessica hurries to the car stopped in her driveway engine
running its horn still BLARING

Inside she sees Helena slumped in the driver’s seat Head
against the horn her body TWITCHING cell phone still in
hand

Jessica opens the door Pulls Helena away from the horn

JESSICA
(checking her over)
Oh my Godare you alright
Helena tries to control herself capture her breathing

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Let’s get you inside

Helena GRABS Jessica fingers pressing into her flesh

HELENA
Noaway from here

Jessica looks into Helena’s eyes -- and understands

She gently slides Helena over to the passenger seat and gets
behind the wheel

With Helena WHEEZING next to her Jessica puts the car in
reverse turns it around and drives away from her house

ON THE ROAD
Jessica drives past vineyards clutching the wheel
Beside her Helena sits up her breathing now under control

JESSICA
Do you need water or anything

HELENA
I’m feeling better now Thank you

Jessica drives giving Helena time to gather herself
JESSICA
What happened back there Did you

feel something again

Helena says nothing for a moment -- eyeing an approaching
vineyard

HELENA
Pull in here and we can talk

IN THE PARKING LOT

Jessica pulls into a quiet space away from the wine tourists
making their way to the Spanish-style tasting room

HELENA (CONT’D)
It’s so much stronger now

JESSICA
What is

HELENA
Something happened there once
Something terrible

JESSICA
In my house

HELENA
No deeper than that It felt like
the land itself was stained

JESSICA
I don’t understand

HELENA
Sometimes when something truly bad
happens it leaves a mark Its
energy seeps into the land itself
And we feel the ripples of that
event over and over again

JESSICA
What happened there
HELENA
I don’t know I just felt the
energy It was so strong So full
of fear and anger
(remembering)
and something else

JESSICA
What Tell me

Helena turns to Jessica

HELENA
They know They all know

EXT VINEYARDS -- LATER
Jessica makes her way through the fields breathing heavily

The Fall vines now harvested the leaves wilting and falling
away from the gnarled trunks like shrunken fingers

Three black crows perch on an oak tree watching her

Jessica pushes through the land growing wild as she moves
past the rows of trellised vines to the wild uncleared former
orchards beyond

Feet slipping under her Jessica makes her way to where the
CREW is working at clearing the land with machetes

The crew stops when they see her They all stare

Jessica sees a red-ribboned charm hanging from one of the
fruit trees The same one she saw on the vines earlier

She grabs it holding it before her

JESSICA
I want to know about this

The crew turns to an OLDER MEMBER

The OLDER MAN steps forward summoning a younger CREW MEMBER
to translate for him

JESSICA (CONT’D)
What is this for

OLDER MAN
(through translator)
It keeps her away from us

JESSICA
Keeps who away

INT WINERY -- DAY

David and Hal shirts off are working on the tanks full of
fermenting grapes pushing the floating skins back down into
the blood-red juice--

--when Jessica stalks in David pulls his arms out of the
tank His arms and torso are stained dark red

Hal sensing trouble goes to check on the barrels

JESSICA
You knew
DAVID
What are you talking about

JESSICA
The Hooded Woman The spirit that
comes in the night You knew and
you didnt tell me How could
you

DAVID
Jess that’s just guys talking
They’re pickers -- they’re

superstitious That’s the wine
business One bad season and a
legend is born Everyone tells
stories

JESSICA
Not about evil spirits Aren’t you
worried that thing out there could
hurt our baby

DAVID
There’s no spirit out there Jess
I’ve lived here longer than you and
I’ve never experienced a thing
When you were on your meds you felt
the same way

JESSICA
Nosomething bad happened here
once Helena felt it

DAVID
Ch God please don’t tell me you’ve
sucked Helena into this too
Nothing bad ever happened here
Not with the Porters Not ever
There’s never been anything here
except orchards

JESSICA
You should have told me

DAVID
I didn’t want to fill your head
with stories about ghosts and
goblins I was worried that

JESSICA
Worried that what

DAVID
That you would start acting exactly
like this That it would tip you
in the wrong direction during a
very difficult time

JESSICA
We should leave Go back to LA

DAVID

No

(gathering himself)
Jess we can’t I’m so close
We’ve sunk everything into this
crop I get one shot -- one shot --
to make it out here We don’t have
the money for a second vintage
Walk away now and we go back to the
city back to the way it was Is
that what you want

JESSICA
Its no different here I saw you
with that woman The redhead I
saw you two at the hotel Who is
she One of the ones from LA I
never met Or is she a new one
Tell me David

David takes a long pause He starts to answer then stops
himself

David steps towards her trying to be calm

DAVID
I just want us to find a way back
to each other

David reaches out for her with red-streaked hands trying to
hug her

JESSICA
(slapping his hands away)
Don’t touch me

DAVID
Jesspleasewe both want the
same thing right For you and the
baby to be healthy Just like Dr
Nathanson said

But she’s not listening suddenly staring past him

Jessica pushes past David and picks up a wine bottle that is
sitting on his work desk

It’s the aged bottle that Victor Napoli gave him
She stares at the old decaying wine label half peeled off
There is a partial picture of an old grand house on it

curt TO

INT WINE CAVE -- DAY

Dapper Victor Napoli lays bottles into his wine cellar
Except his cellar is an actual CAVE underneath his winery

There are shelves and racks built into the cool dim cave

An ASSISTANT brings Jessica down

VICTOR
Ah Jessica look at you You look
wonderful -- the fruit of life
JESSICA

That’s kind of you to say Victor

VICTOR
You didn’t come here to have an old
man tell you how beautiful you are

JESSICA
It’s still nice to hear

VICTOR
How can I be of assistance

JESSICA
That night you came over you
brought us this bottle from the
valley

Jessica reaches into her bag and takes out the old bottle

VICTOR
Ah yes the Ruston

JESSICA
You said that it was vinted with
grapes from our land

VICTOR
Yes by a family of wine makers
from Alsace I believe

JESSICA
I’m trying to find out some more
about them

VICTOR
Such as

JESSICA
Look here on the label See that
It looks like a house right

VICTOR
Yes could be
(he smiles)
Come with me

DEEPER IN THE CELLAR

Victor leads The cave gets narrower Jessica has to duck
as she shivers against the cold

VICTOR (CONT’D)
I should have another bottle back
heresomewhere

He ducks deep into his wine archives

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Some of the Rustons still live in
the area In fact I met one of
them She pours over at Peachy
Canyon A true Titian beauty if I
remember correctly

Victor pulls out another old dusty bottle He examines it
with Jessica

VICTOR (CONT’D)
Voila Ruston ‘89

It’s the same label as before -- only this one is not
damaged There is a clear picture of a house on it

VICTOR (CONT’D)
There’s your house

He rubs the dusty label off There is a name written in
cursive above the picture -- oOsoco

JESSICA
Osoco What’s that

VICTOR
I don’t know It could be the name
of the vineyard Or the name of
the house Or the name of a pretty
girl Whatever it was that
inspired the wine maker

Jessica stares at the old label

DISSOLVE TO

INT TASTING ROOM PEACHY CANYON -- LATER
An owlish OLD VINTER puts a wine glass out for Jessica

OLD VINTER
What can I start you with today

JESSICA
I’m looking for Angela Ruston

OLD VINTER
Angela you have a visitor

At the other end of the rustic bar -- a striking young
REDHEADED WOMAN looks up

Jessica stares at her hesitating Could it be the same one

ANGELA

(smiling as she
approaches )

You must be Jessica

ON A PICNIC TABLE OUT BACK

Jessica sits across from the buxom Angela squinting as she
looks into the sun

ANGELA (CONT’D)
Yeah we always heard the old house
was haunted That was the family
legend My brother used to scare
the hell out of me whenever we
drove by saying the spirits were
going to follow us home

JESSICA
What happened to the house

ANGELA
It burned down I think You sure
I can’t get you anything Water

JESSICA
No I’m fine Thanks Do you know
what happened in the house that
caused it to be haunted Did
something really bad happen there

ANGELA
No the way I remember hearing it
the house was haunted when they
built it They never understood
why You should really talk to my
Aunt Marion Shes the one who
keeps all the family history

Jessica takes the old bottle of Ruston out of her purse

ANGELA (CONT’D)

Wow My Dad had a few of these

We used to drink them at Christmas
JESSICA

What about the name on the label

Osoco Do you know what it means
ANGELA

It was the old Indian name for the

valley I think My aunt would

know for sure

INT CAR -- LATER

Jessica is driving through wine country A light Fall shower
dots her windshield

Her phone RINGS Caller ID says it’s David She ignores it
Jessica turns the car off the main road down a driveway

Through the windshield we see her pulling up to the historic
San Miguel Mission

cut TO

INT SAN MIGUEL MISSION -- LATER

A JESUIT leads Jessica through the old Adobe mission the
arched wood-beamed ceiling high above them

They stop at a long wooden table where FATHER BURRIS 63 is
studying some old maps His belly hangs over his frock and
ketchup from the burger he is eating stains his collar

FATHER BURRIS
(not even looking up)
Busy Go away

JESUIT
This young lady wants to know about
the Osoco valley

FATHER BURRIS
Another ghost hunter huh

JESSICA
I live there

Father Burris looks up from his maps readjusting He eyes
Jessica’s belly

FATHER BURRIS
Please have a seat

Jessica sits down as Father Burris clears away his mess

JESSICA
Why did you think I was a ghost
hunter

FATHER BURRIS
Osoco is the Kurok word for Night
Walker Apparently they believed
an evil spirit lived there

JESSICA
What kind of spirit

FATHER BURRIS
“Spirit” may be the wrong word
The actual translation means
“reflection” or “residue”

JESSICA
Residue of what What happened
there
FATHER BURRIS
Nothing at all according to our
records The Kurok lived across
the whole area yet they refused to
ever settle there It was
completely unpopulated until some
wine pioneers came in during the
nineteenth century

JESSICA
Why does no one know about this I
googled the hell out of the name
and found nothing

FATHER BURRIS
Because it was a very long time
ago The only records we have of
it come from Father Albelda -- and
most of his research died with him

JESSICA
Who was he

FATHER BURRIS
When the Spanish first came to
California there was a Jesuit --
Father Albelda -- who took it upon
himself to drive the spirit of the
Devil from the New World He
traveled from mission to mission
determined to show the local tribes
the power of the Lord Jesus Christ
When he came here he of course took
an interest in Osoco Valley

JESSICA
What happened to him

FATHER BURRIS

We don’t really know And that’s
what the ghost hunters always want
to ask about

(off Jessica’s look)
Father Albelda went into the valley
to confront the evil that dwelt
there in the name of Jesus Christ

(beat)
They found his body two weeks
later Dead of a heart attack He
was twenty-six

EXT WINE COUNTRY -- EVENING

Jessica drives back on the dark country roads clutching the
steering wheel on the slick pavement

She rounds bends Her headlights cut the looming darkness
We see twisted vines A dash of fog A misting drizzle

Jessica turns off the main road down the narrow dirt road
that leads to her house

Her headlights illuminating the wet trunks of the eucalyptus
trees nearly home--

--when the HOODED FIGURE suddenly crosses the road right in
front of her

Jessica SWERVES wildly to avoid hitting it

Her tires SKID on the mud as the car slides off the road
CRASHING through the brush before sideswiping a tree

Jessica takes a moment In shock She checks herself
Thank God -- she’s okay

She grabs the emergency kit from under the seat removes the
flashlight and gets out of the car

Jessica shines the flashlight into the brush all around
The small beam bouncing off leaves and branches

She sees nothing

Jessica slowly inches forward branches scraping her shining
her flashlight in front of her from side to side--

--when something starts moving towards her through the brush
Frozen she shines the light on the shaking bushes--
--as David pushes his way through

DAVID

He runs to her looking her over holding her tight

DAVID (CONT’D)
What happened Are you hurt

JESSICA
She was here I saw her She ran
right in front of the car

David stops and looks at his wife Her face scratched by
branches The car hood steaming crashed in the brush

Oh Jess

JESSICA

hurt us

Jessica pulls away from him thinking

starts filling it with clothes

this house Not with that thing
out there

DAVID
Jess this is nuts Think about
it If the house is so haunted
how come you’re the only one who
can see it

JESSICA
I don’t know Maybe being pregnant
is making mé more sensitive
opening senses I didn’t know I had
like Dr Nathanson said

Jessica zips up the suitcase

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Something terrible happened here
once I don’t know what But it
left some kind of energy --
something bad Its out there
right now And it wants to hurt
us

DAVID
It’s the middle of the night
You’re pregnant You’re in no
condition to go anywhere

Jessica goes cold not wanting to hear any more

ANGELA (CONT’D)

JESSICA
What is it

ANGELA (0S)

Marion and I told her you were
living on the land now and she
insisted on seeing you

ANGELA (0S) (CONTD)
She says you need to know why the
house burned down

cur TO

EXT PASO ROBLES - THE NEXT DAY

It’s raining a storm in the sky as Jessica pulls up in
front of an unremarkable house on a quiet street

She hurries to the door knocking -- until Angela lets her
in

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Angela leads Jessica into THE KITCHEN She brushes aside
empty wine bottles and full ashtrays from the kitchen table

ANGELA
Aunt Marion just called -- she’s
stuck in traffic She’ll be here
any minute Can I get you
something to drink

JESSICA
Maybe some water please

ANGELA
Coming right up

Jessica has a seat as Angela fills a glass

ANGELA (CONT’D)
So it turns out there’s all kinds
of stories about the house Stuff
I never knew

JESSICA
Like what

ANGELA
Aunt Marion can tell you more but
my great-grandfather built it
himself It was his dream house
But as soon as he moved the family
in they started experiencing all
kinds of weird things Whistling
noises Pounding on the doors
The sound of a lady crying Made
no sense at all Things got so bad
that my great-grandmother moved the
family out and burned the house
down herself

ANGELA (CONTD)
apparently not only did she not
want to live there herself -- she
didnt think anyone else should
live there either

(beat)
Sorry probably not what you want
to hear about your property

The doorbell RINGS

ANGELA (CONT’D)
There she is

Angela goes to answer the door Jessica sits alone with her
glass The rain streaks down the window

She hears the door open and VOICES as Angela welcomes her
aunt inside

Jessica’s cell phone RINGS It’s David again She
hesitates about to answer--

--when Angela returns with AUNT MARION 51 a frumpy woman
with glasses Jessica turns her phone off

ANGELA (CONT’D)
Aunt Marion this is Jessica

JESSICA
Hi Thanks so much for meeting me

Jessica gets up to shake her hand Aunt Marion gets her
first good look at Jessica -- and goes suddenly pale

She just stares at Jessica Worried Angela holds her aunt
by the elbow to support her

ANGELA
Aunt Marionare you okay

Marion can’t take her eyes off of Jessica
AUNT MARION
(gathering herself)
We should sit down There’s
something you need to see

AT THE KITCHEN TABLE

Angela sits next to her aunt across from Jessica

AUNT MARION (CONT’D)
Before she moved out Lydia Ruston
brought in a medium to try and
cleanse the house The medium went
into a trance to contact whatever
spirits were trapped there -- and
while in that trance had a violent
reaction of some sort overwhelmed
by what she saw

JESSICA
What did she see

AUNT MARION
She could never say After that
night she never spoke again
Aunt Marion takes a breath before continuing
AUNT MARION (CONTD)
The only clue we have are the
sketches she made while she was in
her trance
Aunt Marion slowly pushes a frayed manila folder to Jessica

Jessica opens the folder

Inside are old drawings on aged paper Ragged pictures
etched with a mad hand

Jessica looks down -- at drawings of a hooded figure The
same figure she has been seeing

Then she turns the page
Her fingers tremble as she looks down
THE DRAWING IS OF JESSICA

She turns the page then the next -- all of the drawings
over a century old are of her and the hooded figure

JESSICA
NoI don’t understand

When she stops at the last drawing

It is of her and David

He lies on the ground There is a spear going through his
chest

cur TO

INT CAR -- LATER
The rain beats down on the roof The windows are steamed up

Near tears Jessica clutches the cell phone with both hands
as she talks

JESSICA
There was also a picture of you
with a spear or something through

there

DAVID (0S)
These drawings were from when

JESSICA
1891 They were made by the medium
the Rustons brought in She saw

us
DAVID Jess that was over a hundred years
ago

There’s a pause Jessica tries to calm herself The rain
beats down

DAVID Okay we’ll leave I don’t want to

EXT WINE COUNTRY -- NIGHT
Wipers try to push the rain away as it beats down in sheets

The road is muddy Wheels slip as they turn Jessica
curses trying to stay on the road

She turns down the road to her house The bare eucalyptus
branches hang wet and low

Through the windshield we see the house lit up against the
night

She pulls up to the house peering at the front door
Jessica HONKS

Nothing

She punches in David’s number on her cell

It RINGS No one answers

JESSICA
Shit

Jessica gets out of the car ducking into the rain and
hurries to the front door

She hesitates for a beat then opens the door and steps--
INSIDE THE HOUSE

--where she sees David in the living room He smiles

Relieved she runs to him hugging him--

DAVID
Hey there

--when she realizes that David is not alone

Eileen her friend from LA is there Dr Nathanson is
there And the REDHEADED WOMAN she saw David with at the
hotel Not Angela

Jessica lets go of David confused

DAVID (CONT’D)
It’s okay Jess Everything’s
okay

JESSICA
What are they doing here

EILEEN
We’re here because we love you
sweetie

DR NATHANSON
We all care about you Jessica
David asked us to come over tonight
to help you though this tough time

Jessica stares at the OTHER WOMAN

JESSICA
Who is she

DAVID
Jess this is Victoria Lambert
She’s the family therapist I told
you about We asked her here
tonight because we think she can
help you

VICTORIA
Hello Jessica It’s good to meet
you I’ve heard so many wonderful
things about you from your friends
and of course David

Ignoring her Jessica spins on David

JESSICA
You planned this

DAVID
It’s for your own good Our own
good

JESSICA

You lied to me

DAVID
Jess I just don’t want you or the
baby to get hurt

EILEEN
Sit down sweetie I’m making some
tea

VICTORIA

Your friends know you’ve been going
through a rough time They want to
help you regain control

Jessica barely listens to her She’s focused on David only

JESSICA
What is she going to do to me

VICTORIA
We’re going to go to my ranch A
safe nurturing place where you can
relax and be comfortable for the
remainder of your pregnancy

JESSICA
(to David)
Don’t do this Please No We
have to go We have to get out of
here Something bad is going to
happen

DAVID
Please Jess It’s for the best

--when a high-pitched WHISTLING noise cuts through the room

The same whistling Jessica has heard before -- oniy this time
clear undistorted earthly

Jessica turns to the sound oddly transfixed

DAVID (CONT’D)
Jess

She ignores him as she follows the whistling sound--

INTO THE KITCHEN
David and Fileen trail after her concerned

On the stove the tea kettle boils over forgotten emitting a
shrieking WHISTLE

Jessica stares at the steaming kettle for a moment

Eileen reaches forward and turns off the gas burner The
whistling dies down to a whimper

She pours the hot water into waiting mugs
EILEEN
What kind of tea do you want I’ve
got Sleepy Time Lemon Zinger and
Chamomile

Jessica doesn’t answer still staring at the kettle
thinking

--when from down the hall she hears the sound of a WOMAN
CRYING

The same crying as before only crystal clear now Human
Jessica turns staring down the dark hallway

She slowly walks towards the crying

David and Eileen exchange a look He follows after her
Jessica barely notices locked in on the woman crying

She stops at the closed door to the guest bedroom

The crying 1s coming from the other side

Jessica takes a breath -- and slowly PUSHES open the door--
--the bedroom is empty An open suitcase on the bed

Yet Jessica can still hear the crying

She pushes the door open all the way and steps--

INTO THE BEDROOM

Jessica turns to the sound of the crying

The television on the bureau is on Jessica looks at the
screen

A cheap movie plays An actress bends over a casket at a
funeral bawling her eyes out chewing up the scenery

Jessica stares at the television She picks up the remote
and presses mute The crying ends

David steps softly into the bedroom

DAVID
Jess
JESSICA
(thinking)

I heard this crying before So
did the Rustons But now its
real not a haunting

DAVID
Eileen just left the TV on That’s
all

David comes up behind her and gently touches her

DAVID (CONT’D)
Come on Let’s go back

JESSICA
(thinking it through)
They saw this night

Jessica turns and looks up at him He’s not listening

She goes rigid at his touch -- then soft as if deciding on
something

JESSICA (CONT’D)
I’1l do what you want

DAVID
It’s for the best I know it’s
hard
He puts his arm around her as they leave

Jessica takes a last look back at the now-silent actress
still crying on the TV screen

curt TO

INT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica sits on the couch Eileen sits next to her holding
her hand David stands behind her conferring with Victoria
Lambert and Dr Nathanson

It is raining cats and dogs Thunder RUMBLES in the
distance

EILEEN
That kid is going to come any day
now and then all of this is going
to just seem like a bad dream
Everything’s going to go right back
to normal You’ll see

Jessica nods barely listening as she looks around into the
quiet corners of the house still holding onto its secret

David comes and sits on the coffee table in front of her

DAVID
I’m going to finish packing your
bag Anything special you want to
bring

JESSICA
My photo albums I want to
organize them

DAVID
You want to bring all the photos

JESSICA
Yes Please

DAVID
That’s a lot of stuff

JESSICA
Please

DR NATHANSON
I’1l help you carry it out

David and Dr Nathanson go back to the den
Jessica turns to Eileen

JESSICA
I’d like to have that tea now

EILEEN
Alright You just stay there

JESSICA
Chamomile please

EILEEN
(warm smile)
You got it

Eileen goes into the kitchen leaving her alone with Victoria
Lambert Jessica glances to make sure David is far away

Victoria kneels in front of Jessica a kindly smile on her
face patting her knee

VICTORIA
I dont want you to be scared You
are not being locked up Think of
this as an opportunity to get
centered To go to a place where
you know you’ll be safe David
will come and see you every day
The most important thing is that
you and the baby are taken care of

JESSICA
Don’t tell me how to take care of
MY BABY--

--and Jessica SHOVES Victoria away from her knocking her to
the ground

Activating Jessica BOLTS running for the front door

As she runs she grabs her car keys from the foyer table not
looking back--

BANG BANG BANG

Something POUNDS on the door from the other side

Jessica freezes staring at the door

David comes up besides her taking her by the arm

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

David turns and stares at the door He can now hear it too
JESSICA (CONT’D)

Don’t open the doordon’t let it
in

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

DAVID
Stay here

David steps to the door

JESSICA
Nodon’t

David opens the door

The Hooded Fiqure is standing right on the other side

Rain pours over its sodden hood as it stands there a dark
specter in the wet night

Jessica backs up in terror -- as the wet Figure slowly pulls
back its black hood

And there is Sadie

She is wearing a black Patagonia raincoat She looks scared
and nervous

DAVID
Sadie

SADIE
We need your help

Jessica can only stare at Sadie She looks terrified

Ben comes sloshing up through the mud of the driveway bags
on his shoulder

SADIE (CONTD)
(freaked out)
We were drivingmy water broke
We were on our way to the hospital
and we saw something in the rain
and skidded and the tires blew
out

DAVID
Calm down It’s alright

Sadie puts a protective hand over her pregnant belly as wet
Ben comes up besides her He also looks nervous

SADIE

DAVID
Of course Come in lLet’s get you
out of the rain

SADIE

BEN

They step inside David takes Jessica by the arm gently but
firmly pulling her along with him

DAVID
(quietly)
Come on

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT
David and Eileen help Sadie to the couch

Jessica watches as they peel off her wet black jacket
Victoria sticks close to Jessica keeping an eye on her

Ben stands in the foyer watching anxiously

BEN
Is she going to be okay

DAVID
She’ll be fine

They lie Sadie down on the couch She is scared looking
around wildly

SADIE
My baby

DR NATHANSON
You’re okay now I’m a doctor
Tell me what happened

SADIE
(gathering herself)
My water broke The hospital said
to come in So we packed our bags
to go I’m not due for another
three weeks but they said it would
be okay that the baby was viable

Ben looks on as Dr Nathanson starts to examine her touching
her belly -- when Sadie SCREAMS with pain arching her back

DR NATHANSON
She’s having contractions We need
to get her to a hospital

David looks out the window It’s pouring

DAVID
Not in this weather

Dr Nathanson takes a deep breath

DR NATHANSON
It’s been a long time since I did
this Okay get a bed ready
Clean sheets

DAVID
The back bedroom

EILEEN
I’ll get it ready

DR NATHANSON
And I need hot water Lots of it
Boiled

VICTORIA
I‘1l get it
(turning to Jessica)
Jessica come with me please I
need your help

Jessica nods She starts to follow Victoria into the kitchen
when she stops and looks at Ben

He shifts nervously in the foyer watching hospital bags at
his feet

His boots leave wet footprints on the foyer floor -- just
like the ones she saw earlier

Jessica’s eyes follow up to his hand--

--where he absently turns coins over on their edges

One after another leaving them on their edges on the foyer

table -- just as she saw in the hauntings
Jessica stares at the turned-over coins -- as Ben senses her
look

He turns and looks back at her There is something cold and
mean in his eyes

Jessica backs into the kitchen after Victoria

VICTORIA (CONT’D)
Where are your big pots

But Jessica doesn’t listen She glances at the ceramic pig
over the sink -- The Chef is Always Right

As Victoria searches for a pot Jessica quietly slides the
deck door open and slips out--

INTO THE NIGHT
Jessica RUNS

Through the rain Sloshing through the mud Stumbling as
her feet stick Her big pregnant body clumsy

The storm pounds down The rain blinding in its intensity

Behind her there is a shaft of light as the door opens and
David comes out chasing after her

DAVID
Jess

Jessica ignores him keys in hand making her way to the car

She fumbles with the keys getting the door open almost
there--

--when David catches up to her

He pulls her away from the car grabbing the keys from her
She fights him but he holds her The rain soaks them both

JESSICA
(frantic)
We need to leave Now It’s all
happening tonight

JESSICA (CONTD)
All the hauntings were reflections
of tonight The bad thing that
happened here -- it’s us

DAVIDB
Calm down

JESSICA
All the hauntings the ghosts the
sounds -- tonight they’re real

Whatever happens tonight somehow
haunted back across time WE ARE
THE HAUNTING

She pulls against him with all her might David holds tight

DAVID

You can’t get in that car Look at

what happened to them No one’s

driving tonight
JESSICA

It doesnt have to happen We can

leave Together

She stares at him desperate loving--

--when the sound of a GUNSHOT cuts through the rain

It came from inside the house
David and Jessica turn back and look at the house
Then they look at each other

DAVID
Get in the car

Jessica nods

David hurriedly helps her into the car then gets behind the
wheel himself They say nothing

He starts the car wheels spinning eventually grabbing the
mud

Wipers beating back the rain David reverses turns the car
around and heads away from the house--

--when Ben steps into their path He is holding a rifle

David hits the gas bearing down on him Ben calmly stands
his ground

BANG -- he fires the gun at the car Jessica SCREAMS

Ben FIRES again Tires blow out The car SKIDS in the mud
coming to a stop

Ben is on them gun in hand He opens the door and roughly
yanks David out

David tries to resist Ben KICKS him brutally in the head
David curls up with pain in the mud

JESSICA
NO

Ben comes around to Jessica’s side

But she is gone

IN THE DRIVING RAIN

Jessica RUNS

The rain beats down on her Her feet slip in the mud
She looks back searching the pitch black night

In the faint glow from the house she sees Ben coming after
her He is moving quickly

Jessica scrambles looking around madly for a place to hide
She looks up -- towards the vineyards
IN THE VINEYARDS

Jessica moves through the wet rows trying to be quiet
hiding amidst the vines

She moves up the slope The vines are tall and thick
She looks around madly hardly able to see a thing
When lightning CRACKS overhead--

--and she sees Ben down the row coming after her

Jessica turns and runs madly as fast as her feet will carry
her

She THRASHES through the vines pushing them away crashing
between them

The vines twisting and giving way -- just as she saw in her
visions

Jessica slips on the wet slope She scrambles to her feet
but Ben is upon her gun in hand

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Noplease

But Ben is oddly gentle with her treating her gingerly

Ben gathers her up carrying her forcefully yet carefully
back towards the house

JESSICA (CONT’D)
What are you doing

She stares at Ben He says nothing

cur TO

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT

Ben helps Jessica inside as he roughly drags the half-
conscious David with his other arm

Sadie is finishing binding Eileen and Victoria covering
their mouths with gaffers tape They stare up in horror

Dr Nathanson lies face-down on the floor lifeless his
sweater soaked in blood

Jessica stares at the dead doctor then at Sadie in shock

JESSICA
What did you do Your baby

Ben throws David to the ground in the foyer still holding
onto Jessica

He goes over to Eileen and Victoria He CRACKS both of them
with the stock of his rifle knocking them out

Ben and Sadie exchange a look Sadie smiles sweetly so in
love

DAVID

(coming to)
Take whatever you wanthere’s my
walletthere’s cash in the barn
too about a grand take itjust

don’t hurt us

David pulls out his wallet and tries to hand it to Ben

DAVID (CONT’D)
Take it

Ben just smirks as he swats away the wallet It goes
skittering away beneath the couch

BEN
Give me the rope

Sadie goes to the “hospital” bag and pulls out a length of
rope She tosses it to Ben

Ben puts down the rifle and starts to bind David--
BEN (CONTD)
(to Sadie)

You’ll have your baby soon

--as Ben says this in a moment of distraction David
LAUNCHES himself at Ben catching him off-guard

David knocks the bigger Ben off-balance

Jessica grabs the distraught Sadie before she can help
holding her tight

Ben staggers his eyes going mean He turns on David coming
at him--

--when David grabs a glass lamp and SMASHES it hard across
his face

The glass shatters Ben staggers his mouth bloody David
hits him again HARD

Blood spurts Ben falls to the ground unconscious
Sadie watches silent something inside her turning hard
David takes the length of rope and begins to bind up Ben--

--as Sadie RIPS free of Jessica with an almost animal
strength

She heads towards David intent something flashing in her
hand

JESSICA
David watch out

David turns from Ben -- but it’s too late

Sadie is on him He looks at her -- then down

There is a knife in his side Blood is slowly staining his
shirt

David stares into her cold eyes Sadie shoves the knife in
deeper

JESSICA (CONT’D)
NO

David slowly collapses to the ground clutching at Sadie
As he falls David turns to Jessica
DAVID
(fading)

RunGet out of here

Jessica stares frozen with horror as David collapses
lifeless to the floor

Sadie turns to face Jessica bloody knife in hand

As Sadie gets to her feet David’s stiff clutch still grabs
at her trying to protect his wife and child

As she pries his weakening fingers off Sadie’s shirt shifts--

--and we see a pillow strapped to her flat belly

Disgusted at the gasping bloody David Sadie kicks the rug
over him

Frozen with shock Jessica stares at the pillow -- then at
the bloody knife in Sadie’s hand

The dots connect
Jessica RUNS

She dashes through the house as fast as her pregnant body
will carry her

The front door blocked by Sadie Jessica runs down the hall
and--

INTO THE BATHROOM
Frantic she locks the door behind her

Jessica grabs the phone madly punching in 911

Behind her Sadie POUNDS on the bathroom door

911 OPERATOR (0S)
What’s your emergency

JESSICA
HELP ME PLEASE HELP

911 OPERATOR (0S)
Is the perpetrator still there

JESSICA
Yesplease help me

Jessica sees the blade of a bloodstained knife slipping into
the door frame as Sadie tries to pry the lock

Jessica drops the phone and turns to the window throwing it
open She starts to try and squeeze herself through

Sadie’s blade WIGGLES the lock

Jessica continues trying to squeeze through the window
Halfway out now

She squeezes and squeezes -- struggling to get her pregnant
body out -- but she’s just too big

The lock POPS

The bathroom door swings slowly open
Sadie strides in

She yanks Jessica backwards by her hair

Jessica grabs for something to hold onto but cannot get
purchase her hand sweeping madly across the sink counter

Shampoo and moisturizer bottles clatter to the floor

Jessica fights against Sadie kicking and scratching at her
She bites her hand and Sadie relents for a moment Jessica
falls free whacking her head on the toilet bowl Dazed she
wobbles away from Sadie crawling into the shower stall
trying to hide

SADIE
Jessica

Sadie pushes through the shower curtain reaching for Jessica
-- just as she saw in the hauntings--

--and hauls the groggy Jessica out of the stall pulling her
across the cold modern tile

cur TO

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Sadie drags Jessica down the hallway
Jessica CRIES out Sadie pays her no mind

Jessica turns and sees that Sadie is pulling her towards the
master bedroom

JESSICA
Nono

FLASH -- to the blood spilling across Jessica’s sheets

JESSICA (CONT’D)
NO Not my baby

Jessica tries to grab out grasping the floor scraping the
wall anything to stay away from the bedroom

Jessica’s nails DIG into the walls as Sadie drags her --
SCRAAAATCH SCRAAAATCH SCRAAAATCH -- making the same wild
scratching sounds that she heard earlier

But Sadie will not be deterred the slight young woman fueled
by a primal ferocity

Sadie pulls the crying Jessica--

INTO THE BEDROOM

--and SLAMS the door shut behind her Just like before
Sadie roughly tries to shove Jessica up onto the bed

JESSICA (CONT’D)
No

She fights against her anything but that bed

She wriggles free her hands grabbing at the dresser shelves
pulling them out--

--but Sadie is too strong She hauls Jessica up onto the
bed

Jessica fights wildly scratching at her captor -- when Sadie
SLAPS her hard knocking pregnant Jessica back stunning her

Sadie gets up on top of Jessica and ties her up to the
bedposts with bungee cords from her hospital bag

JESSICA (CONT’D)
(crying)
Why are you doing this

Sadie doesn’t say a word as she finishes binding Jessica

JESSICA (CONT’D)
Don’t hurt my baby

Sadie turns to Jessica’s face shoving a sock into her mouth
While close Sadie pauses looking coldly at Jessica

SADIE
I would never hurt a child Not
like you

Sadie wraps gaffers tape around Jessica’s face holding the
sock in place

SADIE (CONT’D)
I should never have had a
miscarriage I was always meant to
be a mother Its who I am Sol
waited You were never meant to be
a mother I could tell All you
care about is yourself Not the
baby I tried to protect the baby
keep you from hurting it But you
wouldnt listen Now I’m going to
make things right The way they
were supposed to be

Jessica shakes her gagged head weeping as Sadie calmly goes
about her business

Focused Sadie turns back to her bag She takes out printed
surgical instructions from a website

SADIE (CONT’D)
Don’t worry Jessica The baby’s
going to be fine

Sadie takes out a box-cutter from the bag She ratchets out
the blade

SADIE (CONT’D)
I know what I’m doing

She takes out a lighter and holds its flame to the box
cutter’s blade sterilizing the metal

Sadie turns to Jessica and gently lifts her shirt up

Jessica’s engorged belly is exposed Her breath goes up and
down wildly as she hyperventilates

Sadie stares at Jessica’s belly A sick sweet smile spreads
across her face

She lays the blade flat against Jessica’s stomach and gently
touches Jessica soothing the restless child inside

SADIE (CONTD)
It’s okay Mommy’s here

Jessica yanks at her restraints desperate

Sadie smiles as she lifts the blade checking her internet
instructions before making the incision

Every cell in her body pulling veins pulsing Jessica
strains and strains--

--until she’s able to yank one hand free just a few fingers

Her hand flaps around searching for something anything to
protect her child with knocking over books and magazines--

--when her fingers land on the knitting needles on her night
table

Sadie touches the tip of the blade to Jessica’s belly Its
point pricks the taut skin

Jessica’s hand wraps around the long needle wielding it with
maternal fury--

--as she SLASHES out at Sadie

The knitting needle JABS into Sadie’s arm KNOCKING it away
from Jessica’s belly before she can cut

Sadie turns on Jessica Box-cutter in hand Cold madness in
her eyes

--when Jessica jerks her arm free and SLASHES at Sadie again

The needle goes into Sadie’s neck penetrating an artery

Blood SPURTS

Sadie stares at Jessica for a moment knitting needle
sticking out of her neck a strange sadness about her

SADIE (CONT’D)
My baby

--and falls forward as red blood pulses from her neck oozing
across the sheets

Jessica pulls back as blood flows across the white sheets --
just as in her vision

Jessica grabs the box-cutter away from the bleeding Sadie
desperately cutting at her bonds trying to free herself

Sadie slides off the slick bed falling to the ground with a
thump the life pulsing out of her

Jessica gets her other hand free She rips the tape from her
mouth pulling out the sock--

--when a bloody hand reaches up grasping for Jessica
Sadie’s head rises over the lip of the bed as she tries to

pull herself up staring at Jessica with sad eyes -- then
falls to the floor

Sadie is dead Jessica and her baby are alive
Covered in blood but alive

curt TO

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Jessica staggers out of the bedroom and down the hallway

She is spattered with blood in shock still holding the
knife

In the living room she stops staring at the carnage The
bloody rug covering her husband

Tears pour down her face uncontrollable
--when something moves under the rug

Fingers the shape of a hand reaching up to her -- just as in
her haunting

Jessica RUSHES to the rug throwing it back

There is David Bloody but alive
Jessica holds him for dear life

Flashing red and blue lights fill the living room as
emergency help arrives outside

Jessica and David embrace He smiles through his pain

We hold tight on their embrace her tears of terror now tears
of joy

FADE TO BLACK
