INT APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH rests on the night stand It’s THREE
GUYS in GRADUATION ROBES arms wrapped around each other as
champagne pours down over their heads

An ALARM GOES OFF The photograph is knocked off the table by
a hand reaching out to shut off the alarm

EVAN REYNOLDS looks out from under the covers at the
broken glass from the picture frame

EVAN
Shit

As Evan gets up we see a MORE CLEAN CUT version of the guy
from the photo this is the kind of guy you would trust to
date your sister

Evan stands in front of his closet TWO SUITS hang inside He
decides on the blue one Or maybe they’re both blue

Evan finishes making his bed grabs his pleather workbag
leaves the immaculate room and steps into

INT APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A DISASTER AREA Where the carpet isn’t covered with fast
food wrappers it’s stained with bong water Evan steps
through the obstacle course of trash and looks at the couch

JASON in a bathrobe stares bleary-eyed at a laptop
This is the second GUY from the photo He’s the guy you go to
the store with for a pack of smokes and end up in an illegal
poker game in Koreatown going all in with a pair of fives

EVAN
Are you watching porn on my work
computer again

A girl’s voice MOANS from the computer screen

JASON
Maybe Don’t worry I bookmarked
the Asian stuff for you

EVAN
My company monitors that shit Why
don’t you use your own computer

JASON
It crashed

EVAN
I know like a month ago
JASON
If you knew why are you rubbing it
in It’s kind of a dick move Ev
Evan looks around for his coffee mug in the FILTHY KITCHEN

EVAN
Can you clean up a little today

JASON
It’s Nardo’s turn to clean

EVAN
Nardo’s still in Mexico and it’s
getting pretty disgusting in here
JASON
I know Just imagine what it’s
gonna look like by the time he gets
back

Evan snatches the computer from Jason and leaves

EXT UGLY APARTMENT BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Evan emerges from the garage of the hideous pink stucco
apartment building in his brand new VOLKSWAGON GOLF Car and
Driver’s “Most Sensible Auto” for 2010

EVAN
Why are you calling me at work We
talked about this

JASON
I’m replaying GTA San Andreas and I
forgot how to bone that super
acrobatic stripper

EVAN
Youre replaying that game You
almost flunked Sophomore year
because of it

JASON
That’s not fair I almost flunked
because I smoked too much of that
weed YOU brought back from Canada
Come on Carl’s been pulling jobs
all morning he needs to get some

EVAN
(sighs )
Go to Le Sex Shoppe and put on the
gimp suit then grab the purple
dildo off the shelf

A SECRETARY (50s) passes by Evan as he says this She looks
at him aghast Before he can explain she quickly walks off

JASON
The Dildo Right thank you

EVAN
Please stop calling me

They hang up Evan goes back to working on bullshit

INT EVAN’S OFFICE - LATER

Evan is at his desk looking over a folder with a co-worker
METZNER (20s) a guy who lives for the bi-annual sale at
Restoration Hardware and loves “hilarious” email forwards

a presentation to a group of EXECUTIVES headed by
MACDONALDSON (50s) the company’s chief partner Sitting
behind Evan is a group of YOUNG ASSOCIATES

EVAN
--We were eventually able to
negotiate a deal at a fraction of
their current stock price

Evan clicks a button advancing the slide to a graph
demonstrating whatever he was just saying

MACDONALDSON

wrong about you

EVAN
(confused)

A SECRETARY KNOCKS poking her head in the conference room

SECRETARY

EVAN
No it wasn’t I need to be in that
meeting

JASON

take the bus again
EVAN
No way It’s a new car and you’re
a terrible driver

JASON

EVAN
Only because I was there to
supervise Forget it

Dejected Jason hands Evan the Paper Bag and leaves

EVAN
What’s this

JASON
Cruller It’s fresh That’s what
friends do Evan They buy each
other Crullers

Evan watches him leave He looks in the bag and pulls out a
HALF-EATEN CRULLER and looks at it

Metzner strolls up to Evan chomping on an apple They both
watch Jason get on the elevator

EVAN
Is the meeting over
METZNER
Yup
EVAN

Damn it Jason

METZNER
Yeah your roommate kind of screwed
you Did you think about my offer

Evan nods his head

METZNER
So you gonna sign that lease with
me or what

Metzner hands Evan a BROCHURE for the CHATEAU GARDENS

There’s a fountain in front of a two-tower complex and an
insert photo of a cheesy veranda where an attractive couple
toasts over glasses of iced tea

EVAN
(torn)
It is nice But I don’t know man
I’ve been living with those guys a
long time
METZNER
Sure I get it You’re hanging on
to the past

Metzner points to a page in the Brochure

METZNER
-But if you’re thinking of moving
on it might as well be in a corner
unit with a double view of the
park and a built-in Cappuccino
machine Think about it

Metzner leaves Evan stands there holding the brochure in
one hand the half-eaten Cruller in the other

Macdonaldson walks by Evans cube

MACDONALDSON
Missed you at the end of that
meeting Reynolds

EVAN
Sir I wanted to explain

MACDONALDSON
No need You’re out there

Evan sighs relieved Macdonaldson turns back around

MACDONALDSON

everything there is to know about
this Nakatomi Deal

INT APARTMENT —- LATER

Evan walks into the apartment slamming the door behind him
Jason is at the kitchen sink wearing RUBBER GLOVES

JASON
Ev you’re home Check this out--

EVAN
Youre unbelievable

JASON
Thanks man

EVAN
It’s not a compliment I have to go
golfing with my boss tomorrow so he
can hear all about the “Nakatomi
Deal” thanks to you
JASON
You’re pissed about that All you
talk about is trying to get your
boss to hear your ideas I just got
you like five hours of face time

EVAN

To talk about a deal that doesn’t
exist What the hell am I supposed
to say

JASON

Simple A group of German
terrorists seized the Nakatomi
building holding everybody
hostage and tried to steal six
hundred million dollars in unmarked
German Barabonds But a rogue cop
foiled their plans and killed them
all Now Nakatomi wants to unload
the Plaza for a price

EVAN
Nevermind I’1l1 figure something
out

JASON

We can fire up the Tiger Woods ‘09
if you need to work on your stroke

Evan ignores him He drops his bag and goes to grab a beer
from the fridge That’s when he notices

The kitchen is filthy SACKS OF SOIL spill dirt out on the
floor and the counter is lined with POTS FLUORESCENT LIGHTS
and PLANTING TROWELS

EVAN
What is all this

JASON
(proud)
It’s my new business

EVAN
Youre selling dirt

JASON
I’m growing Salvia Divinorum

EVAN
Salvia You’re growing drugs in our
apartment

JASON
It’s not a drug It’s a natural
herb It’s therapeutic

Evan looks at him skeptical

JASON
All right So it’s a natural herb
that when you chew it happens to
be a pretty gnarly hallucinogen

Evan picks up a bag of seeds and checks it out as Jason
enthusiastically fills a pot with soil

EVAN
This is crazy What are you doing

JASON
I think they call it “mulching”

EVAN
No I mean with your life When are
you going to get a job

Jason gestures to all the shit in the apartment

JASON
What do you think this is

EVAN
This isn’t a job It’s a hobby An
ILLEGAL hobby In our kitchen

JASON
Technically it’s not just in our
kitchen

Evan looks around The living room is filled with POTS He
walks into the bathroom the bathtub is filled with soil

Evan SIGHS and walks slowly back into the living room where
Jason is now watering his plants

EVAN
I’m moving out

JASON
Yeah right Can you toss me that
dirt scooper thing

EVAN
I mean it this time I’m leaving at
the end of the month

JASON
You’re serious

Evan hands Jason the BROCHURE for the CHATEAU GARDENS

EVAN
I won’t leave you guys hanging or
anything Ill pay my share until
you find a new roommate

JASON
When were you going to tell us

EVAN
I wasn’t really sure about it
(trails off)
-I’m telling you now

JASON
Youre really going to live alone
EVAN
I’m moving in with Metzner from
work
JASON

The “Bro-seph” guy Seriously

EVAN
Metzner’s all right

Jason slumps on the couch He picks up one of the bags of the
Salvia Seeds and starts pulling off the sticker

JASON
This is bullshit

EVAN
Don’t be like that We’ll still see
each other all the time You guys
can come hang out whenever you
want

JASON
No THIS is bullshit
(holding up Salvia bag)
I got ripped off They’re just
Coriander seeds with a Salvia
Sticker over them

Jason digs into an ashtray and pulls out a roach

EVAN
Are we gonna talk about this

JASON

Chateau looks delightful I’m happy
for you

EVAN
We’ve been roommates for five
years You don’t have anything to
say

JASON

had to a pet I’m not putting him
through that kind of loss

EVAN
(exasperated)
Fine I’m going to sleep Have you

Jason searches the mess on the coffee table He finds the
BOTTLE OF PILLS and tosses it to Evan

JASON
Drugs are never the answer dude

the roach

hundred clams

JASON

Kenny whips out a handheld METAL DETECTING WAND and starts
passing it up and down Evan’s body

Evan looks at Jason confused Jason shrugs

BEEP BEEP Kenny passes the wand over Evan’s watch He does
it again to make sure BEEP Kenny pulls out a little plastic
bin (like at an airport) and gestures for Evan to put the
watch inside

EVAN
It’s just a watch

Kenny holds out the bin expectantly

EVAN
It was a graduation gift from my
dad

KENNY

My house my rules You’1l get it
back when you leave

Evan irritated places his watch in the bin

KENNY

each other off or can we conduct
some business

INT NICE HOUSE - GARAGE - A LITTLE LATER

Jason sits on a stool in front of a blue background as Kenny
adjusts a LIGHT in his mini photo studio

Evan paces the room anxious He starts playing with a PAPER
CUTTER lifting it up and down

KENNY
(to Jason)
Can you tell your Butler not to
touch my equipment This stuff’s
expensive

Evan leaves the Paper Cutter and continues pacing

EVAN
I’m pretty sure using false
identification to enter a different
country is a felony

KENNY
You know what else is a felony
Being a total pussy

Jason starts laughing hysterically Kenny starts giggling
along with him suddenly child-like

EVAN
(to Jason)
What are you laughing at That
doesn’t even make sense

KENNY
Okay that’s enough Let’s get your
picture
Jason smiles big
KENNY

Don’t smile so much It’s your
driver’s license not the fucking

Kenny takes the picture Jason is BLINDED BY THE FLASH He
stands up and BANGS HIS KNEE INTO A TOOL BOX

JASON
(Re his knee)
Ow Fuck
KENNY

Hey keep it down

Kenny’s Mom grabs a BASEBALL BAT and starts SWINGING it
SCREAMING at the top of her lungs

KENNY’S MOM

Evan and Jason try to dodge the swinging bat Kenny giggles
at the scene thoroughly enjoying the chaos

Just as they manage to reach the door Jason stops goes

mailbox as he turns a corner Jason leans out of the window

EVAN
It’s a Rolex

JASON

windshield

JASON

Evan storms down the shoulder of the freeway Jason follows

EVAN
You can take the car I’1l figure
out my own way home

JASON

Evan ignores him and keeps walking

JASON
You know if I go alone I’1ll find
some way to fuck it up and Nardo’1l
end up dying in the Mexican desert

EVAN
I’ve got my own shit to deal with

JASON
Oh I get it now This isn’t your
problem You don’t need to worr
about Nardo because he’s not going
to be your roommate anymore
(MORE)

JASON (CONTD)
You claim nothing’s gonna change
but Nardo’s life is on the line
and you’re ready to abandon him

EVAN
This isn’t about Nardo It’s about
you pushing me into doing things I
don’t want to do And I’m sick of
it

Evan storms off Jason pulls out EVAN’S CHATEAU GARDENS
BROCHURE

JASON

(yelling out to Evan)
Fine Go ahead go back and chill
with Metzner in

“Mediterranean luxury with
Textured Saxony Carpeting gold-

have to come Don’t leave it to
Jason Hell fuck it up and I’11l
die out here in the Mexican desert

Jason RAISES AN EYEBROW “See”

Evan thinks about it He looks down the Freeway towards Los
Angeles then back toward Mexico

NARDO
Ev

EVAN
All right I’m coming Nardo

JASON
Yes

NARDO
I owe you for this bro Get here

dick off out here

EVAN
Well be there before you know it

Nardo looks down the road and sees HEADLIGHTS APPROACHING

NARDO
Fuck there’s a car coming

EVAN
Just find a safe place to hide

Evan hangs up

EVAN
(to Jason)
Okay no fucking around This isn’t
a roadie it’s a rescue mission
It’s not about fun it’s about
saving Nardo

JASON
What if I have fun like by
accident Are you gonna get mad

EVAN
Let’s just go get Nardo

EXT FLACO’S GAS STATION - SAME TIME

Nardo runs towards some empty oil barrels at the side of the
gas station and ducks down behind them

A beat up PICK UP TRUCK approaches at high speed A BOTTLE
flies out of the truck and smashes on one of the barrels
Nardo ducks as BEER and GLASS rains down around him

The Truck speeds off and Nardo breathes a sigh of relief He
looks around for something to wipe himself off

He sees the LEG of A PAIR OF PANTS sticking out from one of
the barrels

NARDO
Pants

Nardo crawls over to the barrel and yanks on the pant leg It
seems to be stuck He stands up and really YANKS on it
Something pulls it back in the opposite direction

NARDO
What the fuck

Nardo looks behind the barrel and sees that a SMALL MANGY
PUPPY is playing tug of war with him and the pants

NARDO
Hey little buddy I need these
more than you do
Nardo pulls the pants again and the Puppy GROWLS
NARDO
Okay game time is over Give me
the pants

As Nardo reaches down and SNATCHES the pant leg away from the
Puppy we hear the PANTS RIP

The Puppy HOWLS
NARDO
Sorry buddy that’s the law of the
wild Survival of the fittest

Nardo pulls on the pants They fit perfectlyExcept there’s
a massive HOLE IN THE CROTCH

NARDO
Ahhh man

Nardo tries to keep his balls from seeping out of the hole

Something GROWLS behind Nardo

Nardo turns around TWO VERY ANGRY looking FULL GROWN COYOTES
are baring their teeth foaming at the mouth

NARDO
Oh fuck me

Nardo backs up as the Puppy joins its Mom and Dad

NARDO
Youre a baby coyote how adorable
Now tell your Mom and Dad we were
just playing

The Coyotes move into an attack formation

NARDO
(backing up)
This is just one big
misunderstanding

The Coyotes lunge toward Nardo he takes off SPRINTING down
the HIGHWAY

NARDO
Please don’t bite me

INT VOLKSWAGON GOLF - SAME TIME
Evan and Jason are cruising down the Freeway

JASON
We should drive faster Did you
know in Mexico a gringo gets
abducted every seventeen seconds

EVAN
You made that up

JASON
Did I Do you really want to take
that chance

EVAN
I’m going seven miles an hour over
the speed limit It’s the amount
tolerated so you don’t get a

ticket

JASON
It used to be seven Now it’s
fourteen

(off Evan’s skepticism)
I read it in YOUR Men’s Health

Evan presses down on the gas speeding up a little

EVAN
Nardo should have listened to me I
showed him the travel advisory
warnings about Mexico

JASON
This isn’t Mexico’s fault This is
Tracy’s fault It’s like the old
saying “You date the same crazy
bitch for four years you end up
naked on a Mexican Highway”

EVAN
Tracy’s not THAT bad

JASON
On her own maybe But together
they’re banana shit pie

EVAN
I have no idea what that means

JASON
Just a bad combination

A SIREN BLARES behind them

EVAN
Damn it

Through the rearview mirror we see the FLASHING LIGHTS from
a PATROL CAR Evan glares at Jason as he pulls the car over

JASON
Don’t look at me It’s not my fault
Men’s Health doesn’t fact check

Jason looks over his shoulder at the FEMALE OFFICER getting
out of her patrol car

JASON
We can get you out of this ticket
EVAN
What are you talking about
JASON
The cop is a chick
EVAN
So
JASON
So let’s run “Klosterman’s Sister”
EVAN
She’s a cop not a drunk chick in a
bar
JASON

Same principle You work your
magic and she’1l definitely let us
off with a warning

EVAN
It’s not gonna work
JASON
Sure it will you’re the master at

this
Evan watches the Officer approach over his shoulder

EVAN
(considering it)
I am good at it aren’t I

JASON
Irresistible Come on I know how
much you hate getting “points” on
your record Just the thought of it
is probably giving you hives

EVAN
Okay Just don’t over do it

OFFICER GABRIELLA RAMIREZ (20s) a tough attractive Latina
knocks on Evan’s window

JASON
Whoa she’s hot

EVAN
Shh
(turns to Cop)
Evening officer

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Did you know you were driving
fifteen miles over the speed limit

JASON
It was fourteen Officer

Evan elbows Jason

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Can I see your license and
registration please

Evan reaches into his pocket Jason leans over taking a good
look at Officer Ramirez and widens his eyes

JASON
Holy shit You’re Klosterman’s
sister

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Excuse me

JASON
(to Evan)
Check it out It’s Klosterman’s

sister
(to Officer Ramirez)
When did you become a cop

OFFICER RAMIREZ
I really don’t know who you’re
talking about

Evan studies Officer Ramirez

EVAN
No man That’s not her She’s not
Klosterman’s sister

JASON
She is totally Klosterman’s sister
Look at her

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Do I look like a “Klosterman” to
you

JASON
So how is Klosterman anyway

OFFICER RAMIREZ
I’m going to say this one more time-

EVAN
No It’s not Klosterman’s sister
She’s much prettier than
Klosterman’s sister

JASON
Oh yeah You might be right

OFFICER RAMIREZ
I’m glad we got that behind us
Let’s move on

EVAN
It’s true Klosterman’s sister is
pretty cute but you’re even
better

OFFICER RAMIREZ
“Better”

EVAN
Yeah I would like pay to be with
you You know

Jason looks sharply at Evan mouthing “What are you doing”

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Wait did you just say you would
pay me

EVAN
No no no I didn’t mean it like
that I wouldn’t actually pay you
like you’re a hooker I just mean
youre really hot But I would only
have sex with you if it was free

Jason stares at Evan flabbergasted
OFFICER RAMIREZ

Are you offering me sexual favors

as a bribe to get out of a ticket

EVAN
Exactly No I mean

Officer Ramirez pulls out her pad and CLICKS HER PEN

OFFICER RAMIREZ
License and Registration

Jason looks at Evan disappointed in him

JASON
(leaning past Evan)
Officer I’m going to level with
you We know you’re not
Klosterman’s sister You know how
we know that

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Because I’m wearing a name tag that
says “Ramirez” on it

JASON
Nope Because there is no
Klosterman’s sister She’s made up
She’s a tool we use to flirt with
hot girls in bars It usually works
like a charm

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Wait that was flirting
(to Evan)
Is that what you were doing

JASON
He’s a little out of practice

OFFICER RAMIREZ
Listen guys I spend my whole night
pulling over idiots who try to get
out of tickets I hear a lot of
bullshit Yours was the most
insulting in a long time

Evan hangs his head ashamed

OFFICER RAMIREZ

But it was creative and
(looking at Evan’s Tux)

»-you did get all dressed up But
I can’t reward that execution I’m
going to give you a fix-it ticket
for the cracked windshield so you
have room to improve

She finishes the ticket and hands it to Evan

OFFICER RAMIREZ
But don’t go propositioning anymore
police officers I might get
jealous

Evan nods Officer Ramirez walks back to her car laughing

JASON
That’s a cool cop Funny too
(turns to Evan)
What the hell happened to you
(MORE )

JASON (CONTD)
We must have run Klosterman’s
Sister a hundred times and you
never implied that the girl was a
hooker

EVAN
Let’s just drop it okay

Evan starts up the car and pulls off the shoulder

JASON
“IT would only have sex with you for
free” Wow

EXT SMALL MEXICAN TOWN - NIGHT

Nardo hides in the alley of a SMALL MEXICAN TOWN He is out
of breath and frightened

His pants have been torn to shreds and his legs are all
scratched up He watches as the Coyote Family HUNTS for him
down the main street of the town

The Coyotes walk by THREE OLD MEN sitting in front of a store
playing DOMINOS As the Coyotes walk by the Men casually PET
them They wag their tails

NARDO
Sure youre nice to the Mexican
guys

Nardo goes to the other end of the alley and sees a PAY PHONE
down the deserted street He runs toward it

INT VOLKSWAGON GOLF - SAME TIME
Evan drives looking intense

JASON
Don’t beat yourself up about it

EVAN
(defensive)
I’m not It went fine We got out
of the ticket

JASON
Well you got a fix it ticket
which is kind of a bigger pain in
the ass And that cop is definitely
going to be telling all the other
cops a hilarious story about how
this pathetic guy tried to get out
of a ticket by calling her a whore
But yeah it went fine
EVAN
I just don’t want to be doing that
juvenile shit anymore

JASON
You mean talking to girls

EVAN
I mean running game on them That’s
not what I’m about now

JASON
(sarcastic)

Of course that’s not what “New
Evan” is about

EVAN
What “New Evan”

JASON
The one with the Men’s Warehouse
suits the sensible car and the
boring job that he won’t admit
sucks

EVAN
You don’t even know what I do How
can you say it sucks

JASON
Okay what do you do

EVAN
I research undercapitalized
companies and evaluate their
potential for growth

JASON
Yeah that SUCKS
(beat)
Youre prioritizing all this shit
over stuff that actually matters
It’s like you’re training yourself
to be unhappy

EVAN
I’m just growing up At some point
youre gonna have to do that too

JASON
Maybe but why would I want to do
it one second before it’s
absolutely necessary

EVAN
Because lying on the couch all day
watching The View and masturbating
to Elisabeth Hasselback isn’t a
life

JASON
Neither is sitting in a cube all
day updating your 401K and NOT
getting laid

EVAN
I’1l get back in the game when I
find a woman who appreciates a more
mature lifestyle

JASON
She sounds ugly

Nardo shakes his head vigorously turning away from her

NARDO

The Trashy Hooker gestures towards the HOLE in the CROTCH of
Nardo’s PANTS making a JACKING OFF MOTION offering him a
HANDJOB

TRASHY HOOKER
(whispering)

NARDO

The Trashy Hooker nods her head

NARDO

The Trashy Hooker hands Nardo an ID

Nardo looks up at “RAUL” and inspects “HER” closely Oh yeah

RAUL

Raul reaches for Nardo’s crotch Nardo jerks away

NARDO
No handjob just ID

EVAN

INT CHIEF JACKPOT’S CASINO - NIGHT

Evan and Jason enter the large high ceilinged casino with a
Native American theme It’s adorned with teepees and crafts

Jason is instantly intoxicated by the chips being shoveled
across felt and the bells on the slot machines

MARTY the slick MANAGER spots Jason and walks over to them

MARTY
Jason Good to see you

JASON
Hey Marty

MARTY

It’s MY money back there and I can

Jason nods pulling Evan aside He walks him over to the
COCKTAIL LOUNGE

JASON
Ev this is my thing and you’re
fucking it up Why don’t you just
chill at the bar There’s a killer
stage show

On a STAGE a muscle-bound Native American (HUGO) wearing
only a loin cloth THROWS TOMAHAWKS at a Spinning Wheel A
banner overhead reads “THE AMAZING HUGO”

EVAN
I don’t want to see ‘The Amazing
Hugo’ I want to save Nardo and get
back for my golf game

and pretty easy You should try
hitting on her

Evan sees the cute COCKTAIL WAITRESS in a POCOHANTAS outfit

EVAN
I’m not going to hit on a waitress

JASON
You need the practice Your
instincts are all out of whack

Evan doesn’t hear Jason He’s looking at a PRETTY GIRL
sitting at the bar wearing a BUSINESS SUIT

JASON
(RE “Business Suit” Girl)
This is a perfect example of what
I’m saying You never want to mess
with a girl in a business suit

EVAN
Why

JASON
You can’t trust them They’re into
weird shit Like businessand
suits

Evan scoffs Jason redirects his head back toward Pocohantas

JASON
Stick with the Indian Princess
It’s the safer play

INT CHIEF JACKPOT’S - LOUNGE

Evan watches Pocahontas sell a pack of cigarettes to someone
He considers talking to her for a moment but instead goes to
the bar where the Businesswoman (CHRISTY) is sitting

EVAN
Do you mind if I sit

Christy checks Evan out She smiles

CHRISTY
Are you sure you want to do that

EVAN
Why wouldn’t I

CHRISTY
Youve heard the story A nice guy
has a drink with a strange girl in
a casino She gets him up to her
room one thing leads to another
and then he wakes up three days
later missing a kidney
EVAN
I only have a few minutes so I
think I’1ll chance it

CHRISTY

You must be the new Magician

EVAN
No I don’t work here

Two more of whatever she’s having

CHRISTY

boring than it sounds

EVAN
Do you work with web-based models
or traditional elements

CHRISTY
(surprised)
Web-based You know this stuff

EVAN
Well I work in IP acquisitions for
Macdonaldson and Associates so I
guess you can say B2B is

(chuckles )
-kind of an intra-discipline
imperative
Christy laughs Apparently that was some kind of

CHRISTY

I didn’t know that Magicians were

so funny
EVAN

I didn’t know that Organ Harvesters
were so smart

CHRISTY
It’s not as easy as it looks

The bartender returns with two drinks

Christy holds up a glass They toast and drink Evan recoils
from the taste

EVAN

CHRISTY

Evan puts his down

EVAN
I’m driving I better take it easy

Christy puts her hand on his knee and moves in close
CHRISTY
One little drink isn’t going to
hurt you

She downs hers and looks Evan in the eye moving her hand up
his thigh He downs half his drink and smiles back at her

Christy takes a razor and starts shaving the hair around
Evan’s stomach There are some CIRCLES AND JAGGED LINES drawn

on his side with a sharpie

EVAN
Prepping me for what

CHRISTY
I warned you about drinking with a
strange girl in a casino

EVAN
Wait you’re actually going to
steal one of my kidneys

CHRISTY
I’m afraid so

EVAN
But why are your clothes off

CHRISTY
I didn’t want to get blood on them

Christy rubs alcohol on his kidney area Evan panics

EVAN
You can’t do this

Evan tries to get up but can only shake his head

EVAN
I can’t move I’m paralyzed

CHRISTY
Hugo Why is he awake

The Amazing Hugo the muscle-bound oaf from the stage show
comes into the bedroom

EVAN
(confused)
The Amazing Hugo How could you
I clapped for you man

CHRISTY
(to Hugo)
You were supposed to use a
tranquilizer

HUGO
This stuff was way cheaper

CHRISTY
Maybe that’s because it doesn’t
work

HUGO
He’s numb isn’t he Look

Hugo comes over and pinches Evan’s thigh HARD

HUGO
Does this hurt

EVAN
No

Hugo SMACKS Evan on his CHEST with his OPEN HAND

HUGO
Did you feel that

EVAN

(weepy )
No but you made a mark

Hugo and Christy look at Evan’s pale white chest and see a
RED HANDPRINT emerging on his body

CHRISTY
He’s numb but he’s going to freak
when he watches us cut him open

EVAN
Oh God

CHRISTY
See I haven’t even started yet

HUGO
I know what to do

Hugo takes out a SLEEP MASK from the side table and puts it
over Evan’s eyes

HUGO
Now he won’t be able to see his
insides get taken out

Evan tries to move his body again but his head just jiggles
around pathetically

HUGO
I think he’s trying to escape

CHRISTY
He’s not going anywhere Come help
me with the instruments

Christy and Hugo go to the bathroom and start running a bath

JASON
He looked Indian to me Where did

the next balcony several feet over

JASON
I don’t remember you being that
flexible
Jason starts to climb the railing slowly

POCOHANTAS

Jason looks down suddenly freezing at the sight of a THREE
STORY DROP TO A SWIMMING POOL

POCOHANTAS
Would you stop being such a pussy
and jump already

Jason JUMPS and LANDS HARD Pocahontas GRABS him breaking
his fall

POCOHANTAS

Christy and Hugo are in the bathroom with the WATER RUNNING
Evan still blindfolded and gagged has regained some feeling
in the upper half of his body He starts to swing his arms
back and forth

He gears up for one big SWING and yanks his upper body OFF
THE BED

Jason and Pocohantas slide open the glass door from the
balcony They creep into the room and stop short seeing

EVAN his face SMASHED INTO THE CARPET and his ASS IS UP IN
THE AIR with his pants around his ankles

Jason kneels down towards Evan and removes his Sleep Mask

JASON

Ev what the fuck are you doing

Pocohantas picks up a pair of RUBBER GLOVES and a METAL
SURGICAL INSTRUMENT off the end table

POCOHANTAS
Wow Hugo’s into some kinky shit

JASON

thing Did you PAY for this

Evan shakes his head vigorously trying to talk through the
gauze gag Jason removes it

numb Just get me out of here

Pocohantas peeks into the bathroom where Hugo and Christy
are filling the bathtub with ice

POCOHANTAS
We better hurry

JASON
Help me get him up

POCOHANTAS
Maybe pull his pants up first

Evan is humiliated Jason pulls Evan’s pants up They grab
Evan’s arms and drag him across the floor Jason sees the

Pocohantas shoves Evan as Jason yanks his arms forward

Evan immediately drops between the balconies Jason holds on
to his wrists to keep him from falling

JASON

(struggling)
Evan reach up and grab the
railing I’m losing my grip

EVAN

Evan’s feet are flailing in the air

JASON

heavy

They both JUMP OFF as Christy and Hugo open the sliding door
and see them land safely in the pool

CHRISTY

Hugo hurries back inside

IN THE POOL Evan’s head thrashes but his body can’t do
anything

EVAN
(gasping for air)
Jason helpI can’t breathe

Evan sinks to the bottom Jason swims down and grabs Evan
yanking him to the surface Evan takes a HUGE breath of AIR

EVAN
You tried to kill me

JASON
I was trying to save you

Jason pulls Evan out of the pool Evan tries to stand but his
legs give out and he slumps FACE FIRST ONTO A LOUNGE CHAIR

Pocohantas swims to the side of the pool Jason helps her
out and pulls her in for a kiss Pocohantas pushes him away

POCOHANTAS
No chance Jason
JASON

place
POCOHANTAS
You know my name isn’t Pocohantas
right
He doesn’t
JASON
Yeah
POCOHANTAS

What’s my name

JASON
(trying to remember)
Little feather

POCOHANTAS
You’re a dickhead

Suddenly an ARROW WHIZZES BY THEIR HEADS

Jason and Pocohantas look up at the balcony HUGO stands with
his bow another ARROW PULLED BACK FLING They duck as the
arrow flies past them landing with a DULL THUD

They turn their heads and see --

Evan still face-down on the lounge chair with an ARROW
STICKING OUT OF HIS ASS CHEEK

JASON POCOHANTAS
Holy shit Oh my God

Evan tries to turn his head to see what happened but he’s
stuck face down HE DOESN’T FEEL IT

EVAN
What What happened

Jason quickly runs up to Evan and inspects the arrow

JASON
NothingDon’t worry about it

Jason closes his eyes and PULLS THE ARROW OUT BLOOD SHOOTS
out of the wound and HITS Jason in the face

POCOHANTAS
Oof that’s nasty

JASON
(Re Arrow)
Did that hurt

EVAN
Did what hurt

JASON

Jason helps Evan up wrapping Evan’s arm over his shoulder
EVAN
Jay your face is bleeding Are you

Hugo runs out

EXT CHIEF JACKPOT’S CASINO - PARKING LOT

Pocohantas runs back into the hotel Jason watches her run

JASON

EVAN

Evan points to the side of the casino where Hugo emerges

JASON
Let’s move

ON HUGO as he pulls out his BOW AND ARROW aiming at Evan
and Jason trying to get a clear shot He takes out his
lighter and LIGHTS the ARROW ON FIRE

ON JASON hopping in the driver’s seat Evan is upside down
in the passenger seat with his legs flailing out the window
Jason PEELS OUT and drives toward the exit

Hugo pulls the FLAMING ARROW back in the bow FLING

INT VOLKSWAGON GOLF - A LITTLE LATER
Jason yanks Evan’s legs into the car helping him sit up

JASON
That was unbelievable It was like
a three story jump

EVAN
We could have died

JASON
Or your kidney could have ended up
on Craigslist

Evan’s head SLUMPS forward into the DASHBOARD Jason pushes
him back

EVAN
I can’t believe you got my message

JASON
What message

EVAN
The telepathic messageto come
save me You heard it right

JASON

(faking it)
Totally

EVAN

Hey do you smell that

JASON
I read that when you escape death
your body lets off all sorts of
smells You’re smelling survival

EVAN
No I’m pretty sure I’m smelling
something burning

JASON
It is kinda hot in here now that
you mention it

They look in the rear view mirror and seeA FLAMING ARROW
STICKING OUT FROM THE SIDE OF THE CAR

EVAN
Oh shit

Jason yanks the steering wheel pulling the car over to the
shoulder of the freeway as FLAMES spread across the trunk
Jason jumps out and RUNS AWAY FROM THE CAR

Evan opens his door but his legs are still not working so
he slumps down his face hitting the asphalt

EVAN
Jason A little help here I can’t
move

Jason turns around and sees Evan trying to CRAWL AWAY from
the car as the flames continue to spread

Jason runs back to Evan dragging him away

JASON
I got you buddy

EVAN
If we throw some dirt on the fire
we can save the car

JASON
You think

Suddenly the CAR EXPLODES flying up into the air flipping
over and landing on it’s roof

Evan and Jason crouch down covering their heads until the
debris settles They stare at what used to be Evan’s car

JASON
I think you might need to push back
that tee time by like twenty
minutes

INT MEXICAN BUS - DAWN

Nardo boards a small rundown bus as early morning light
creeps through the windows

He’s smiling wearing PANTS and a PONCHO and EATING a FUNNEL
CAKE smothered in POWDERED SUGAR

Nardo walks down the aisle approaching people with empty
seats next to them but they quickly move their bags over
filling them up

He stops by a HEAVYSET WOMAN with an open seat next to her

NARDO
Is this seat taken

The Heavyset Woman shrugs not understanding Nardo smiles
and SITS DOWN next to her

NARDO
Thank you
(offering)
Funnel Cake

The Heavyset Woman smiles and sheepishly and pulls off a
piece and eats it Then quickly helps herself to another

Both of them sit there smiling chewing on Funnel Cake
POWDERED SUGAR ON THEIR CHINS

NARDO
Good right

HEAVYSET WOMAN
(giggling)

Muy Bueno Senor

Nardo laughs too but stops suddenly when he sees a look of
terror on the Womans face

Someone TAPS ON NARDO’S shoulder Nardo looks up to see a
HUGE MEXICAN COWBOY hovering over him

MEXICAN COWBOY
You are in my seat

NARDO
Sorry I didn’t know

Nardo quickly gets up and works his away around the Mexican
Cowboy’s ample frame toward the back of the bus

MEXICAN COWBOY
What were you laughing about Were
you laughing at me

Nardo looks at the Heavyset Woman who’s looking nervously
at her shoes

NARDO
No Of course not I just sat down
It was a mistake

MEXICAN COWBOY
You gave my Wife some of your
treat

Nardo thinks about it He looks at the other passengers who
are watching the scene nervously They shake their heads like
Nardo should say “No”

NARDO
UmNo

The Mexican Cowboy inspects his Wife closely rubbing his
finger along her chin He brings his finger up to Nardo’s
face comparing the sugar

Nardo holds up the funnel cake

NARDO
Did you want some

Beat

The Mexican Cowboy slaps the cake aside and charges after
Nardo chasing him to the back of the bus

NARDO
Oh come on

EXT SMALL MEXICAN TOWN - STREET - CONTINUOUS

Nardo busts through the rear door as the Mexican Cowboy grabs
hold of the hood of his poncho Nardo manages to shimmy out
of it and runs SHIRTLESS down the street

The Mexican Cowboy gives chase Nardo sees a TRUCK with a
LARGE TRAILER ATTACHED driving by He runs towards it and
jumps on to the rear gate as it pulls away

Nardo opens the rear door to the trailer gets inside and
slams it shut behind him

INT TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

Nardo peers through a hole in the door and sees the Mexican
Cowboy shouting curses at him and giving up the chase Nardo
SIGHS in relief

He hears a LOUDER DEEPER SIGH respond behind him

Nardo turns around and sees a BULL staring right at him
just a few feet away separated by an IRON GATE

NARDO
Oh fuck

The Bull Snorts and drives it’s forehead into the bars
bending them Nardo recoils into the corner of the trailer

Nardo tries the open the door but it’s locked

NARDO
(losing it)
Fuck Fuck Fuck

The Bull SNORTS and BUCKS agitated by Nardo’s yelling Nardo
puts his hands up and sits down

NARDO
Okay I‘’1ll chill out Sorry

The Bull calms down Nardo looks exhausted

NARDO
You wouldn’t happen to know if this
thing is going to Tijuana would
you

EXT FREEWAY - EARLY MORNING
Evan and Jason sit on the shoulder of the deserted freeway

next to Evan’s COMPLETELY BURNT CAR Jason plays with some of
the wreckage as EVAN TALKS ON THE PHONE
EVAN

(into phone)
Hey Metzner sorry to wake you man
I need you to do me a solid Go
down to MacDonaldson’s club and
take my tee time with himI had
car troubleI know he’s gonna be
pissedTell him I’1l meet him at
the clubhouse in a few hours
Thanks I owe you for this

Evan hangs up the phone

JASON
“Solid”

EVAN
Shut up

JASON

What are you so pissed about

EVAN
Well let’s see I nearly died AND
my car blew up

JASON
But you didn’t die and you have
insurance on your car You’re
always so negative

EVAN
I’m supposed to be happy We have
no way of getting home and I’m
going to be fired

JASON
What about Nardo He’s stuck in
Mexico Sure he’s got enough money
for a pair of pants but if we
don’t go get him he’1l be fucked
and you know it

Jason gets up and starts walking down the freeway

EVAN
Where are you going

JASON
I’m going to finish what we
started Are you coming or are you
going to sit here mourning your
dead car

Evan doesn’t move

JASON
If we hurry we can still save
Nardo and get you back in plenty of
time to bullshit your way to a
promotion

EVAN
I’m not going to bullshit my boss

JASON
So you’re going to tell him the
truth That’s not gonna get you
promoted

Jason walks toward the off-ramp and looks back at Evan

Evan reluctantly stands and follows He’s now walking with
only a SLIGHT LIMP Jason smiles

JASON
(Re Evan’s walk)
Hey at least you got the feeling
back in your legs

EVAN
I still can’t figure out why my ass
hurts so much all of a sudden

Jason looks and sees the HOLE IN EVAN’S PANTS where the ARROW
PIERCED HIS BUTT

JASON
(covering)
Hmm don’t know what that’s all
about

EXT SAN DIEGO - CHEVRON GAS STATION - LATER

Evan is using a rag to wipe the soot off his tux Jason comes
out of the gas station bathroom wearing a CHEVRON shirt
with a NAME TAG reading “THUAN”

JASON
(re his shirt)
Check out what I scored in the
bathroom

EVAN
Nice work Thuan Let’s find a cab
and get moving

JASON
Let’s hitch a ride It’s Saturday
The road’ll be filthy with cute
girls heading to TJ for the
weekend

EVAN
I don’t care how we get there as
long as we get there quickly

As they walk by the gas pumps a brand new AUDI pulls in
blasting House Music and stopping short right by Jason An
OBNOXIOUS RICH TEENAGER gets out of the car

RICH KID
(seeing Jason’s Chevron
Shirt)
Hey gas her up for me and check
the oil will you Chan The door’s
open

JASON
It’s Thuan

The Rich Kid walks past them and into the Convenience Store

JASON
Looks like we found a ride
(off Evan’s look)
You said you didn’t care how we got
there

Jason opens the driver’s side door

EVAN
Just so were clear you’re saying
we should steal this car

JASON
BORROW this car Just for the day
Then we return it and leave a thank
you note on the windshield

Evan thinks about it a minute He starts nodding his head

EVAN
(sarcastic)
This is a GREAT idea

JASON
Thank you
(checks the ignition)
Fuck he didn’t leave his keys

EVAN
Too bad it was an ingenious plan

JASON
Wait we’ll just hotwire it

EVAN
Another brilliant idea You’re on
fire Remind me how do we do that
again

JASON
You pull the wires out from under
the steering wheel and cut the
green one

EVAN
I think you’re actually thinking of
how you defuse a bomb

JASON
Riiight I’m mixing up my movies
Hotwiring is even easier You just
take the exposed wires
(pantomimes )
And tap them together until they
spark and the car starts

EVAN
At least you’ve thought it through

Jason reaches under the steering wheel and starts to pull on
the wires Evan walks away toward the main street

JASON
(doesn’t notice Evan is
gone)
Okay I see a red wire and a white

wire
Jason pulls two wires apart

JASON
I think I got it

Jason turns and finds the Rich Kid holding an ENERGY DRINK

RICH KID
Hey what the fuck are you doing to
my car

JASON

Umchecking the fluids

RICH KID
That’s not where the fluids are

JASON
Don’t tell me how to do my job You
want me to tell you how much vodka
to put in your Energy Drink

RICH KID
(looking at his drink)
Sorry
JASON

Let’s get a look under the hood

Jason PULLS A LEVER inside the car and the TRUNK POPS OPEN

RICH KID
That was the trunk

JASON
You think I’d let you leave here
without a working trunk Go ahead
and close that for me

The Rich Kid goes to the back of the car and slams the trunk
closed When he looks up Jason is gone

EXT SAN DIEGO STREET - CONTINUOUS
Evan is walking briskly as Jason catches up to him

JASON
Okay that wasn’t a great plan You
have any other ideas

BELLS RING OFF SCREEN

EVAN
I do but it doesn’t involve
breaking any laws or putting our
lives in danger so I don’t know if
you’re gonna like it

JASON
Try me

Evan POINTS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET A TROLLEY comes to a
stop on a set of TRAIN TRACKS People file on filling it up

JASON
The Tijuana Party Trolley Of
course

EVAN

It’s leaving

Jason and Evan run for the Trolley

IE TIJUANA TROLLEY - CONTINUOUS

Evan and Jason jump onto the trolley just as it pulls away
Jason looks around at the crowd of rowdy passengers

JASON
(re The Trolley)
Hello old friend

A HEAVYSET TICKET TAKER (DE’SHAWN) comes up to them

DE’ SHAWN
Sorry guys But we’re at capacity
Youre gonna have to get off at the
next stop

EVAN
Please
(looking at his nametag)
De’Shawn we could really use a
break

DE’ SHAWN
Can’t do it The cops’1ll ticket me

JASON
Well I guess we have to find
another ride

Jason turns toward Evan flashing a DEVIOUS SMILE

JASON
(suddenly “upset”)
Wait a minute Is that It’s
Whitney

Jason gestures toward the front of the Trolley where a CUTE
GIRL (AUDREY) sits with her friend (JOANNA)

JASON
What is she doing here Ev We just
broke up and she’s flirting with
other guys

Jason points to TWO CHEESY GUYS hitting on Audrey and Joanna

EVAN
(sotto)
Jason no I’m not up for another
one of these

JASON
(turns to De’Shawn)
Do you think she’s with one of
those guys De’Shawn

DE’ SHAWN
If that’s your girl it sure looks
like she’s stepping out

JASON
See Ev De’Shawn thinks Whitneys
stepping out

EVAN
I’m not doing this

JASON
(sotto to Evan)
The trolley’s the fastest way to

TJ
EVAN
(sotto)
Still no
JASON
But I fucking love her Ev
EVAN
No Jay you don’t “fucking love
her”
JASON
I do I have to tell her how I
feel

Jason pushes past De’Shawn and RUNS towards Audrey

JASON (0S)
(shouting)
I fucking love you Whitney You
have to take me back

EVAN
Shit Sorry De’Shawn

Evan wades through the crowd to where a seemingly distraught
Jason is pleading with a very confused AUDREY

JASON
Please Whitney I’m lost without
you

Evan steps past the Two Cheesy Guys who look really annoyed

EVAN
Sorry Whitney I tried to stop
him but he’s been hitting the
Captain Morgan’s pretty hard since
you broke up

JASON
(to Audrey
How could you just sit there and
give me that blank stare

AUDREY
I don’t even know you

JASON
I don’t feel like I know you
anymore either But we can get
back to that place where our two
souls were one
(MORE)

JASON (CONTD)
Where we knew every inch of each
other’s tangled sweaty bodies

The TROLLEY PASSENGERS ARE ALL WATCHING the scene like it’s a
soap opera

Cheesy Guy 1 turns to Cheesy Guy 2 confused

GUY 1
(whispering)
I thought she said her name was
Audrey

Jason “checks out” the Cheesy Guys

JASON
Look Whitney I get why you would
want to be with one of these guys
The cool semi-matching Ed Hardy
shirts the leather wrist bands
And this guy

(points at Guy 2’s arm)
---has one of those awesome tribal
tatoos I’ve always wanted I can’t
compete with that

Audrey starts to catch on She smiles at her friend

AUDREY
(playing along)
What do you think Joanna Should I
give him another chance

JOANNA
I always thought you could do
better

De’Shawn walks up to them as the Trolley comes to a stop

DE’ SHAWN
Look guys you have to get off now

The TROLLEY PASSENGERS MUMBLE THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT

AUDREY
(mock sad)
Oh that’s too bad We were just
about to reconcile

JASON
Tell him Whitney tell him he cant
keep us apart
(to De’Shawn)
I fucking love her You can’t do
this to me

DE’ SHAWN
(leading Jason)
I’m doing it

De’Shawn pushes Jason and Evan towards the Exit

JASON
By what authority
(to the Passengers)
Is the Tijuana Party trolley a
dictatorship We’re still in
America right

The Passengers half-heartedly answer him “Yeah” “Sure” “I
think so”
JASON
And what do we stand for in
America
Passengers yell out “Kicking Ass” “Weed” “The Chargers”

Jason wiggles around De’Shawn and works the crowd

JASON
In America we stand for freedom
Like the freedom to get wasted on a
trolley and make total asses of
ourselves Or the freedom to make
out with strangers who’s names
well forget tomorrow

PASSENGERS
Wooo

Jason stops in front of Audrey

JASON
And what about the freedom for a
man to be with the woman he loves
and to have wild passionate weird
make-up sex right here on this
trolley Do we believe in THAT

Audrey CRINGES shaking her head “no” But the crowd is
loving it

PASSENGERS
Yeah Let him stay

Jason turns to De’Shawn

JASON
Well there you have it The people
have spoken You’re not going to go
against their will and separate two
people in love are you

DE’ SHAWN
I wouldn’t think of it

EXT STREET - TROLLEY STOP - SAN DIEGO
Evan Jason Audrey and Joanna are PUSHED OFF THE TROLLEY

AUDREY
(protesting to De’Shawn)
But we don’t even know these guys

They all watch as the Trolley pulls away

JASON
Well that normally ends
differently

AUDREY
You’re an idiot

JASON
Do you want us to walk you
anywhere

JOANNA
Fuck off Thuan
(to Joanna)
Let’s go call your mom

Audrey and Joanna walk off Jason grins widely

EVAN
What are you smiling at We totally
failed

JASON

Did you see me get those people
going I should run for office Or
be like a motocross announcer

EVAN
At least we’re closer to the
border If we hurry we can get to
Borrachos and might actually get
back to LA in time to save my job

INT TRAILER - SAME TIME
Nardo is huddled in the corner of the moving trailer wearing
the PANTS he got from the store The Bull sits calmly The

name “FERNANDO” is printed on a sign hanging on the cage

NARDO
I can’t believe Tracy ditched me

Fernando lets out a loud “SNORT”

NARDO

that I still love her

The trailer slows down a LOUD RUMBLING is heard outside
Fernando starts to get agitated rattling the bars with his
horns

NARDO
Whoa Fernando let’s stay cool

The rumbling grows louder Someone fumbles with the door

NARDO
Yes Open-o el door-o

The trailer’s gate OPENS to a tunnel Nardo hops out

the ceiling of the truck

NARDO

stands of the CORRIDA DE TORROS They CHEER as Nardo RUNS OUT
OF THE TUNNEL being chased by Fernando

Nardo runs by A FLAMBOYANT MATADOR who is clearly confused
by the sight of a skinny white kid in his arena

Nardo looks back and sees Fernando closing in on him
NARDO
(pleading)
Fernando give me a break

Nardo tries to turn right but SLIPS and FALLS FLAT ON HIS
FACE Fernando RUNS OVER NARDO STEPPING ON HIS BACK

CROWD

Nardo remains on his belly The Matador runs over to him

MATADOR

NARDO

The Matador picks Nardo up and pushes him into the middle of
the ring The Crowd goes WILD

Nardo tries to run for a side wall Fernando catches up to
him and BUCKS FORWARD His HORN CATCHES on Nardo’s PANTS and
RIPS THEM OFF

The Pants are stuck on Fernando’s head he’s thrashes around
trying to get them off

Nardo looks down he’s STARK NAKED again

NARDO
He got my pants That bastard

The CROWD BOOS Parents cover their children’s eyes Men try
to shield their girlfriends from the sight

A section of PRIESTS AND NUNS are horrified
Nardo runs around the ring waving frantically to the crowd

NARDO
Can somebody PLEASE help me

But the crowd only shouts insults down at Nardo People start
to throw TOMATOES TACOS AND MEXICAN SAUSAGE at him

Nardo gets hit in the head with an EAR OF CORN

NARDO
Hey

Fernando finally SHAKES the pants off his head
Nardo runs by the Matador who sneers at him
NARDO
Aren’t you a bullfighter Fight
the bull

Nardo grabs the Matador’s cape away from him fastening it
around his waist

MATADOR
That is a bad idea Sefior

Nardo turns around to see Fernando staring right at him

NARDO
I thought we were cool Fernando

Fernando taps his paw on the dirt a few times readying
himself He lowers his head and CHARGES at Nardo

NARDO
Oh shit

Nardo looks around he sees a SALIDA SIGN (EXIT) way up in
the stands behind FERNANDO There’s only one thing to
doNardo takes off RUNNING TOWARD FERNANDO

NARDO
I’m not gonna die I’m not gonna
die

Nardo and Fernando are in a deadly game of chicken Fernando
lowers his head ready to gore

Nardo JUMPS PLANTS HIS FOOT on Fernando’s head and is
LAUNCHED UP INTO THE AIR towards the crowd

Nardo reaches his hands up and grabs ONTO the RAILING
Fernando SLAMS into the arena wall and falls to the ground

The CROWD GASPS as Nardo pulls himself over the railing He
reaches the Exit and sees a GIRL IN A FRILLY QUINCEANERA
DRESS taking a picture of him with her CELL PHONE

NARDO
(to the Girl)
I’m really sorry about this

He SNATCHES HER PHONE and as he RUNS OUT OF THE STADIUM we
see the large HOOFPRINT IN THE CENTER OF HIS BACK

Which way South East

NARDO
I don’t fucking know I’m gonna die
here Listen whatever happens
don’t let Jason give the eulogy
He’1ll be really inappropriate

EVAN
Youre not going to die Just head
towards the arch We’1ll be waiting
at Borrachos Hang in there

Nardo hangs up He creeps along the alley wall peering out
into the empty street He makes a run for it

INT “BORRACHOS” BAR - LATER

Evan Jason and Gabby enter the crowded raucous bar It’s a
hybrid of traditional Mexican fare and American Frat House
They find a table near the window

At the front of the bar is a MARIACHI KARAOKE BAND playing a
Tejano version of “POKER FACE” by Lady Ga Ga which some
Drunk Girl sings along with

JASON
We are definitely doing some
Mariachi Karaoke

EVAN
No way We need to keep a low
profile and not call attention to
ourselves

(MORE )
EVAN (CONTD)
We wait for Nardo and get him home
We can’t afford for anything else
to go wrong tonight

JASON
Fine

Jason stops a waitress passing with a tray full of
and pays for three He puts them down on the table

EVAN
What’s this

JASON
You want to blend in You see
anybody here not drinking

GABBY
He has a point

Evan nods They lift up their drinks

JASON
To Rescue Missions

They clink and drink

GABBY
I’m thinking about a Margarita

Gabby turns to Evan placing a HAND ON HIS SHOULDER

GABBY
How about you guys

JASON
Sure

EVAN

Yeah I’1l have one
Gabby heads to the bar Jason smiles at Evan

JASON
All right what’s your plan

EVAN
(confused)
Wait for Nardo head home--

JASON
Don’t play dumb I’m talking about
the hot cop

EVAN
What about her

shots

JASON
She’s clearly into you The eye
contact the unnecessary shoulder
touching How are you going to
close the deal

EVAN

I’m not closing any deals This
isn’t the right time I’1ll get her
number or something

JASON

She didn’t come all the way to
Tijuana just to give you her
number

Evan looks up at the bar Gabby looks back at him smiling

EVAN
I don’t know

JASON
Trust me on this First we have to
get you two alone I’1l take care
of that part

EVAN
Please don’t

JASON
Then she’ll say something about the
Margaritas being strong

EVAN
How can you possibly know that

JASON
She needs to loosen things up
release herself from the personal
responsibility that would usually
prevent her from hooking up in a
border bar with a random dude she
just met So you’ll respond “I
needed something to take the edge
off” Then she’1ll laugh

EVAN
But that’s not funny

JASON
No but she’ll laugh anyway Then
she’ll say “I like hanging out
with you guys Your friend Jasons
really funny” And you’1ll be like
“Yeah I can see why girls like him
so much”

EVAN
I will never ever say that

JASON
Wait Then she’ll say “Some girls
don’t need a funny guy Some girls
just want a guy who’s sweet and
shy” And then you’ll say “Have
you met anyone like that lately”
And that’s when she kisses you

EVAN
Are we done here

JASON
No This is the most important
part While you’re making out move
in real close pressing your body
to hers so that your boner is on
her leg and then you rub it back
and forth on her thigh

Jason WAGS HIS FINGER BACK AND FORTH to simulate the motion
he’s referring to Evan looks at him disgusted

JASON
They call it the “Windshield
Wiper” It drives chicks crazy

EVAN
You’re full of shit

JASON
Youve been out of the game for
awhile This is Standard Operating
Procedure now If you don’t do it
she’ll think something is wrong
with you

Jason sees Gabby approaching He quickly changes his tone

JASON
-That’s a great idea Ev

GABBY
What’s a great idea

JASON
Evan wanted to see if there was a
back exit So if the heat’s on we
can get Nardo out safely

GABBY
(to Evan)
Cool Ill go with you

Evan leers at Jason As he gets up and follows Gabby Jason
WAGS HIS FINGER BACK AND FORTH reminding him about the
“Windshield Wiper”

Evan rolls his eyes shrugging him off
Evan and Gabby make their way through the crowded bar and
find an empty hallway behind the stage
INT “BORRACHOS” - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Gabby sees a door marked “EXIT” at the end of the hall They
walk up to it trying to push it open but it’s just a wall
with a realistic door painted on
GABBY
(laughing)
That figures

Gabby leans against the “door”

GABBY
At least it’s a little quieter back
here

EVAN
Yeah

Gabby takes a sip of her Margarita

GABBY
Mmm these Margaritas are strong

Evan cocks his head surprised Jason said she’d say that

EVAN
(unsure)
“T needed something to take the
edge off”

Gabby LAUGHS Evan watches amazed Gabby takes another sip

GABBY
This is fun I like hanging out
with you guys Your friend Jasons
really funny

Evan bites his lip a little painfully preparing to recite
his part

EVAN
“Yeah I know I can see why girls
like him so much”

GABBY
Not all girls like funny guys Some
girls just want a guy who’s sweet
Maybe even a little shy

Whoa it’s actually working Evan takes a step closer
EVAN
“Well have you met any guys like
that lately”

Gabby moves in and KISSES EVAN The kiss quickly builds and
Gabby pulls him closer their bodies pressing together

Evan’s eyes are open clearly torn Finally he clenches his
eyes tight and does it

Evan positions his boner on Gabby’s leg rubbing it back and
forth onto her inner thigh doing the WINDSHIELD WIPER

Gabby’s EYES POP OPEN She pulls back confused and a little
horrified Evan looks self-conscious

GABBY
What was that
EVAN
What
GABBY
That thing you were just doing on
my leg
EVAN

UmmThe Windshield Wiper

GABBY
The what

Evan’s mortified The awkward silence is broken by the sounds
of a bar full of people CHEERING

GABBY
Maybe we should get back

Evan nods sheepishly lingering for a moment as Gabby quickly
heads back into the bar room

EVAN
(to himself)
Windshield Wiper I’m such an
idiot

INT “BORRACHOS” - CONTINUOUS

Evan comes out into the bar pissed off He wades through a
crowd of guys bunched by the Karaoke stage and finds Jason
and Gabby

EVAN
(in Jason’s ear)
What the fuck How could you tell
me to do that

Jason ignores Evan fixated on the stage Evan notices and
turns to see what they’re looking at

EVAN
Tracy

ON STAGE TRACY Nardo’s girlfriend (20s petite blonde) is
slurring her way through a MARIACHI version of “POUR SOME
SUGAR ON ME” by Def Leppard

TRACY (SINGING)
Gotta squeeze a little squeeze a
little tease a little more Easy
operator come a knockin’ on my
door

Shes playing to crowd using an empty chair to do a mock lap
dance

JASON
I never would’ve thought anybody
could ruin this song for me Leave
it to fucking Tracy

GABBY
You guys know this person

JASON
That’s Nardo’s girl

GABBY
Wow

ON STAGE Tracy is really into it

TRACY (SINGING)
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh in the name of love
Cmon fire me up

The crowd go nuts as Tracy holds the last note A DRUNK GUY
jumps up on stage and starts making out with her

JASON
She seems to be taking the breakup
pretty well

EVAN
It’s an act This is what Tracy
always does when they split up

Tracy and the Drunk Guy are ushered off the stage

TRACY
(to Drunk Guy)
Hey Cutie why don’t you get me
another drink

As the Drunk Guy leaves Tracy sees Evan and Jason standing
there She approaches them

TRACY
I should have known you two would
rush down here to rescue that
idiot Don’t you have any dignity

JASON
“Dignity” is a funny word for YOU
to be throwing around right now
Trace

TRACY
(sweetly)
You know Jason the best part of
this break up is going to be never
having to see your face again

EVAN

Tracy you and Nardo have been
through too much to throw it away
on a bunch of sweaty drunk guys

JASON
I think the dudes in here can do
better actually

Tracy LUNGES at Jason Jason flinches and knocks into a
table a few GLASSES fall off the table and SHATTER

The BAR MANAGER comes over with a WHISTLE in hand

BAR MANAGER
Hey If you fuck up my bar I’m
calling the police

EVAN
No That won’t be necessary We’re
not going to fuck up your bar
(Re Tracy)
Shes with us

JASON
She is NOT with us

EVAN
Cut it out Jay
(to Bar Manager)
Everything’s cool here sir

The Bar Manager slowly backs away raising a threatening
finger to Evan Evan nods understanding

EVAN
(to Jason and Tracy)
Were just here to get Nardo home
safely I know you care about him
Tracy so let’s calm down okay

Tracy looks at Evan dropping her tough facade She fights
back tears

TRACY
I just can’t do it anymore Evan I
can’t put up with his shit

EVAN
But you love him

TRACY
Not Nardo I can’t put up with
(pointing to JASON)
-HIS shit anymore

JASON
Me Wait this is my fault now

TRACY
It’s always your fault When Nardo
broke his collarbone who was the
one to convince him to stage dive
at an AIR concert

JASON
The show was really boring until he
did that

TRACY

And who told Nardo to shave his
balls with a straight razor so
they’d be ‘extra smooth’

JASON
I did that for you

TRACY
And who’s idea was it for us to
spend our romantic weekend in
Mexico Because nothing bad EVER
happens in Mexico

(MORE )

TRACY (CONTD)
As long as he’s friends with you
he’s always gonna end up fucked up
and naked somewhere and I don’t
want to be a part of it anymore

Evan is looking at Jason

JASON
Don’t look at me like that Ev All
those things she just mentioned
were awesome

The Drunk Guy returns with a shot Tracy downs it and walks
off with him

Gabby comes up to Evan and Jason

GABBY
Guys I think your friend is here

Evan turns around and looks out the window

There’s Nardo huddled nervously in an alley across the
street from the bar

Evan turns back around and sees Tracy SITTING ON THE DRUNK
GUYS LAP flirting heavily

EVAN
Nardo’s barely hanging onto his
sanity as it is If he sees this
hell flip out and it’1ll be World
War Three

JASON
Good Nardo should see it
Maybe now he’1ll finally see what’s
obvious to everyone else

Tracy pulls herself away from Drunk Guy and Jason looks right
at her

JASON
(loudly)
That without make up and all messed
up Tracy’s a seven AT BEST
Tracy GASPS and attacks Jason

TRACY
Ill show you a seven

Tracy SHOVES Jason he flies into a table full of ROWDY GUYS

EVAN
Oh no

A FIGHT breaks out The BAR MANAGER BLOWS HIS WHISTLE Within
seconds TWO POLICIA burst in the front door

EVAN
Fuck Bean bag cops

The Cops fire their BEAN BAGS at people indiscriminately

GABBY
We have to get out of here

Evan and Gabby run for the front door

EXT REVOLUTION BLVD - CONTINUOUS

Nardo sees Evan and his eyes light up He smiles totally
relieved But his smile quickly fades as

Jason stumbles out of the bar with Tracy on his back
pounding him with both of her arms screaming in rage

NARDO
Tracy

JASON
Get it off Get it off

A COP follows them out of the bar and takes AIM with his GUN
NARDO
(thinking gun is real)
Nooooo

Nardo jumps in front of the gun to protect Jason and Tracy

BLAST The Bean Bag NAILS Nardo in the chest sending him
CRASHING to the ground

Evan and Gabby run over to help Nardo He’s rolling around
holding his chest which has a big RED WELT on it

NARDO
(rolling on the ground)
I’m bleeding out

EVAN
You’re fine
NARDO
I can’t believe I’m going to die in

Tijuana

(starts wheezing)
Tell them to donate my eyes to some
little blind kid Then visit that
blind kid and tell him about me

Evan reaches down and grabs a BEAN BAG and shows it to Nardo

EVAN
Youre not dying It’s just a Bean
Bag

NARDO

Don’t lie to me Ev I know I’m
bleeding out

NARDO IS YANKED UP BY HIS ARMS He is held by TWO MEXICAN
POLICEMAN (MIGUEL AND ROBERTO) They look closely at him

ROBERTO
Miguel this is him no From the
bullfight

Miguel looks and sees the HOOF PRINT on Nardo’s back

MIGUEL
I think it is

They immediately cuff him and drag him to their Police Car

NARDO
No pleaseEv do something I
just want to go home

The back door slams shut and Nardo is driven off

Evan and Jason watch the Police Car drive off in shock

EXT TIJUANA STREETS - LATER

A BEAT UP WHITE CABRIOLET with the license plate “NRDO GRL”
works its way through the streets of Tijuana

INT TRACY’S CABRIOLET - CONTINUOUS

Gabby drives as Evan sits shotgun looking angry and tense
He turns around and stares at Jason who’s in the back seat

Evan places his TWO INDEX FINGERS A COUPLE INCHES APART and
shoves them in Jasons face

JASON
(re Evan’s gesture)
What’s that supposed to be

EVAN
That close We were THAT close to
getting Nardo and being able to go
home And you had to go and do
something stupid to fuck it up

JASON
I didn’t do anything It’s Tracy’s
fault
Jason gestures to Tracy who is PASSED OUT next to him

EVAN
You provoked her Tracy was right
No matter how bad the situation
you always make it worse

JASON
You don’t really care Ev Youre
only pissed off because it
inconveniences you Because it
means having to spend a little more
time with us before you move out

EVAN
That’s right I’m done dealing with
your shit You claim that you’re
looking out for Nardo but you’re
the reason he got arrested

JASON
If it were up to you Nardo would
be wandering naked through the
Mexican desert while you’re at
home dreaming about hosting your
first “Game Night” with Metzner

EVAN

Make fun of Metzner all you want
JASON

Okay
EVAN

But at least he wouldn’t make me
look like an idiot in front of the
girl I like

Gabby looks over at Evan suddenly interested

JASON
(confused)
How did I make you look like an
idiot

EVAN
(wags his finger)
The Windshield Wiper

JASON
You did that Dude that was a
joke

GABBY

Wait he told you to do that

Jason starts LAUGHING hysterically

EVAN
It’s not funny

JASON
Yeah it is You’re one sick puppy

Evan grabs Jason’s shirt and pulls on it

EVAN
You always fuck with me and think
it’s funny and I’m tired of it

GABBY
Whoa both of you relax We should
focus on helping your friend

Evan lets go of Jason’s shirt and sits back in his seat
JASON
(readjusting his shirt)

Youre lucky Ev I was about to
make some pretty amazing points

EXT MEXICAN POLICE STATION - LATER

The sun shines over a small POLICE STATION Evan Jason and
Gabby are pooling money onto the hood of Tracy’s Cabriolet

GABBY
How much do you have

EVAN
One Hundred and sixty-seven
dollars That should be plenty to
bribe them right

GABBY
Why don’t you offer them free sex
like you did to me

JASON
This isn’t gonna work We should
just run something What about
“Toby’s Gonna Vomit” Ooh what
about “We Got Beef” That one got
Nardo out of campus lockup

EVAN
We’re not trusting Nardo’s life to
one of your stupid bar games Once
I put money in their hands they
won’t want to let go of it and
well have a deal

CUT TO
INT MEXICAN POLICE STATION - LATER

MIGUEL
(laughing)
This isn’t nearly enough

The Cops Miguel and Roberto are standing looking at the

money Evan has laid out in front of them

Behind them is a small jail cell where Nardo stands

nervously at the bars wearing a PONCHO that says POLICIA

EVAN
You’re going to have to release him
in a couple of days anyway

MIGUEL
A couple days in a Mexican prison
can be a long time A lot of things
can happen to a naked American Boy

NARDO
That sounds bad Ev I don’t like
the way he emphasized the word
“naked”

EVAN
Nardo let me handle this
(to Miguel)
Officer it’s all we’ve got

MIGUEL
Then I guess Sefor Nardo is staying
with us

Evan scoops up the money and hands it to MIGUEL

EVAN
(pressing money into
Miguel’s hand)
Wait just take the money for a
minute and think about it

Miguel takes the money looking down at it He keeps
as if fixated in a trance

Evan nudges Jason smiling It’s working

MIGUEL
Now that I’m holding the money it
seems like an even more offensive
offer And I am thinking that I
should make up a reason to arrest
both of you

Miguel hands the money back to Evan

staring

NARDO
Guys do something
(lifting up his shirt)
I’m really starting to bruise

There is a HUGE BLACK AND BLUE WELT on his stomach

ROBERTO
Bean bags they pack a punch yes

Roberto proudly gestures to the BEAN BAG GUNS HANGING ON A
WALL near the Jail Cell

JASON
I knew we needed a plan B

Evan stares at the Bean Bag Guns on the wall for a minute
Then he looks angrily at Jason

EVAN
Nardo wouldn’t be in this situation
if it wasn’t for you This is all
your fault

JASON
I thought we decided to table this
until we freed Nardo

EVAN

(in Jason’s face)

No I think we should have this
fight RIGHT NOW don’t you

Evan shoves Jason

JASON
What the fuck dude Chill out

NARDO

The Cops lean against the counter to get a better look
Evan and Jason are rolling around on the floor wrestling
JASON

Evan pulls Jason in a headlock SQUEEZING HARD

JASON

EVAN
(sotto)

JASON
Owww you know my nipples are extra
sensitive

EVAN

terrorist watch list while I was
studying abroad

JASON

Evan throws Jason up against the wall
Miguel pulls some money out of his pocket

MIGUEL (SUBTITLE)

ROBERTO (SUBTITLE)
Okay Wait which one is the little
one

Evan and Jason continue “grappling” Evan jams his elbow into
Jasons side

EVAN

Jason CHARGES at Evan who turns and grabs Jason under the
arm and LAUNCHES him FLYING OVER THE COUNTER

Jason slides across the desks and SMASHES into the wall near
the cell He lies there motionless seemingly knocked out

NARDO

hurt

Jason isn’t moving Roberto reaches in his pocket to pay
Miguel on their bet

MIGUEL
(counting his money)

Both Cops instinctively freeze at the sound of a GUN COCKING
They look up Jason’s AIMING a Bean Bag Gun at them

JASON
Hola Muchachos

Jason TOSSES one of the Bean Bag Guns to Evan
MIGUEL
(confused)

Evan cocks his gun

MIGUEL

JASON SHOOTS MIGUEL who goes down in a heap writhing on the
floor and cursing in Spanish

JASON
That was for Nardo

Evan grabs the keys from Roberto and opens the cell SHOVING
MIGUEL AND ROBERTO INSIDE and letting NARDO OUT
