1 EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 1

From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
fire engulfing a small two story house It burns and burns
Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window
lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes

He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
he might run back into the flames But the heat is
unbearable He runs toward us then past us through black
shadows We cannot see his face

1A EXT WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A
Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning
A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes

2 EXT YARD - EARLY MORNINGCONTINUOUS 2

The rock thrower TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open a shotgun
barrel appears and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
the porch

Thinking hes sure to be shot Tom runs into the old barn

3 INT BUSHS BARN - EARLY MORNINGCONTINUOUS 3

Panting in terror Tom is hunkered down in strips of light
trying to see through the cracks There is a loud SNORT and
the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
shoulder

Tom jumps panicked just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into

barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him

Tom freezes bends over and throws up

When Tom looks up a ray of light reveals the half face of a
fierce gray bearded man FELIX BUSH He is holding out a
handkerchief to the boy Shaking hard Tom hesitates then
takes it and wipes his mouth

Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the

boy will never forget before waving him away

4 EXT BUSHS BARN - MORNING 4

Looking back over his shoulder Tom runs for the road Two

of
his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust
BUSH steps into the sun and watches the boy run off
with
a look of muted anger sadness and something much deeper
5 INT BUSHS BARN - DAY 5
Bush enters the barn to check on his companion MULE is
older
than Bush in mule years and just as gray He wears an old
mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold He fidgets
nervously from all the excitement Bush comforts him
BUS H
Just a boy thats all
6 SERIES 6
7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
fresh oneNo Damn TrespassingBeware of Mule Bush checks
the road in both directions All clear for now
8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes Mule

dozes in the shade Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
into his road right past his new sign He glances at his
shotgun leaning against the shack

The Model-T comes to a shaky stop A MAN climbs out sees
Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation

HORTON
Mornin sir

BUSH
Hard life if you cant read

HORTON
Pardon Im uh Reverend Gus
Horton sir how you doing
Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton

BUSH
Dont need saving preacher

HORTON
Uh well Mr Wiley Starke has
passed on sir His funeral is
tomorrow and I thought you might
want to know since

BUSH

(SOFTLY)
What got him

HORTON
Just got old sir

BUSH
Yeah well
Bush returns to chopping wood
Feeling awkward Horton hesitates starts for his car
stops

HORTON
Mr Starke told me that you and him
ran away from home when you were 6
years old Is that true

BUSH
I talked him into it
Bush doesnt turn just keeps chopping

HORTON
Well anyway I alright
Horton shrugs get in his car and leaves
Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying

9 EXT CEMETERY - EVENING 9
frozen

he

in

The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
Starkes fresh grave The mounded earth is covered with
beautiful flowers and wreathes a loving send off from his
family and friends As we pan past the flowers and cards
we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty

Hunkered down nearby Bush is as still as a gravestone
staring at the last resting place of his old friend

As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands

staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave Now

turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction

10 INT BUSHS SHACK - NIGHT 10

Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush soaked to the bone
and shaking with chills rummages through an old hat box by
lamp light Letters news clippings and keepsakes He finds
what hes looking for A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
She smiles at us from happier days Realizing that he is
raging with a serious fever he tries to stand up only to
collapse back on the bed

11 OMIT 111213 11
14 EXT BUSHS SHACK - NIGHT 14

Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp Bush moves
slowly toward the barn But he is so wracked with fever he
has to stop It stuns him that he cant go on He never
thought anything could stop him Stuck in the rain with the
shaking lamp sizzling he stares into the forever darkness
the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light

BUSH
Well hell

15 INT BUSHS BARN - NIGHT 15
Somehow he has made it Sopping wet and shivering Bush is

bad shape and knows it
onto

Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises

Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
snatches his first meal in days

Bush tries to think through the fever He stumbles back to
the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
doesnt make it Satisfied he comes back and drops hard

a pile of hay near Mule

BUSH
Always thought youd go first
White as cotton Bush stares into the lamp that is running
out of oil the light fading fast to darkness Thoughts
tumble through his mind troubling him stirring the dark
waters of memory

16 EXT BUSHS BARN - MORNING 16

PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn The
door is still swung wide open

Back from the brink of death Bush emerges into the blinding
sunlight Mule is dozing in his favorite spot He swings his
big gray head over at Bush

BUSH
Ahh dont look so disappointed

17 OMITTED 17
18 EXT BUSHS BARN - MORNING 18

Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
the barn Mule climbs up on all fours Bush gets a set of
reins and walks toward him Mule starts to take a stroll
knowing what the reins mean

BUSH
You better not
Mule looks back sees an apple in Bushs hand and stops

BUSH
And coffee when we get there
19 EXT MAIN STREET - DAY 19

Old wheels creak and moan Bush and Mule ease up Main street
with the cart PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
recluse

Mule comes to a wearied stop breathing hard Bush climbs

off
the cart and walks Mule ignoring the eyes upon him
20 INT CHAPEL - DAY 20
Reverend Horton stoking the wood stove hears FOOTSTEPS
HORTON
Buddy

But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around
HORTON
Oh Hello
Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
critically looking around
HORTON
What can I do for you sir
Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20s) enter from the
vestibule with their new BABY In their own world and not
realizing that there is anyone in the chapel Kathryn picks
some lint from Buddys jacket He catches her fingers and
kisses them
Bush is transfixed by the loving moment
BUSH
I can wait
Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush Buddy
nods

to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
give Bush and Horton privacy

HORTON
Its alright have a seat
pew

Bush sits down uneasily in a pew Horton sits down in the

in front of him and twists around to face him

light from the near window washes over them

HORTON
Whats on your mind sir

BUSH
Bout time for me to get low

HORTON
Get what

BUSH
Down to business

The wintry

Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of

MONEY on the pew Hortons eyes bulge

BUSH
Need a funeral
Horton looks up from the money

HORTON
For who

BUSH
Me

Buddy peers around from the vestibule
hell until Kathryn pulls him back

HORTON
For you
(off Bushs impatient nod)
You want to buy a funeral for you

BUSH
Am I not talking right

HORTON
No yes Im sorry Are you sick

HORTON

BUSH

and stares into Horton

It feels like
everything in the world stops dead
Buddy peeks in again this time Kathryn peeks too

HORTON
Just stories
(off Bushs intense look)
-you know people talking

BUSH
What kind of stories Say one

HORTON
Sir my mother used to say that
gossip is the devils radio

(UNFORTUNATE ASIDE)
-not that she didnt play that
radio at full volume now and then
bless her heart but
(back to business)
-what matters when you come to the
end of your life is that youre
ready for the next one Have you
made peace with God sir

BUS H
I paid
Horton has no idea what Bush means He looks at the money
back at Bush

HORTON
Well you cant buy forgiveness
Mr Bush Its free But you do
have to ask for it

BUSH
Nothing in this world is free
preacher

Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out His hand bangs
into the pew and the money FALLS

Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops
back into the vestibule
wind

and

him

Bush storms past Buddy Kathryn and the baby like a hot

20A EXT CHURCH - DAY 20A
Bush heads off down the road on his wagon Horton Buddy
Kathryn appear at the door and watch him go

HORTON
That was uh different

KATHRYN
I heard such awful things about him
when I was a kid

HORTON
My mother probably told you some of
them
Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
at the baby Buddy lingers staring at Bush thinking

21 EXT MAIN STREET - DAY 21

Bushs wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies sits in
front of the Diner

Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
drinking it and loving it

Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
on the back of an old pick-up truck He sees Bush and
freezes

Bush looks up and stares at him

The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30s) Toms mother
steps out She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other

BONNIE
What are you doing son
Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on

Bonnie doesnt like this staring match at all

BONNIE
Empty those cans in your daddys
truck and get back in here Now
Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook
Relieved Tom heaves the can up into the truck Bonnie
hesitates then goes back into the diner just as
-CARL (30s) his sidekick GARY and two other MEN come
across the street toward the diner Gary sees Mule slurping
coffee from the big tin cup

GARY
Look at that A mule drinking
coffee

CARL

Finally found somebody that likes
Bonnies coffee
As they move past they see Bush standing there

WORKER
Yall better hush thats old Bush
Carl eyes him Gary and the others throw curious glances as
they head into the diner Carl stops

CARL
Hey

(NO RESPONSE)
Im talking to you
Carl picks up a handful of gravel tosses some over
nonchalantly in Bushs direction Bush ignores it

CARL
We know about you You stay out of
this diner Theres women and
children here and we dont want you
around them
Bush stands to mount up never turning around

CARL
You better hear me I see you here
again Ill Hey Hey
Hearing the hollering Tom looks up from the pick-up
Carl throws a stone harder this time to get Bushs
attention
him

grabs

But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule startling him Old
instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT

CARL
Shit
Carl moves up to try and calm him
-as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
GASH in Mules hind-quarter Mule whinnies painfully slowly
surrendering
As Carl steps up Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
and hits Carl in the chest Air explodes from Carl as he
gasps with pain Before he can move Bush hits him again in
the same place Carl wants to hit back but he has no air
Lightning quick Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
exact same place
Carl falls like a bag of bones He looks up and sees Bush
towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in

It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
Carl

TOM
Daddy
Wild with fear Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush

BONNIE
Stop it Get away
Gary the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
handle in Bushs hand and slow down
Bush comes to himself sees everyone staring sees Carl in
tears and now Tom and Bonnie trying to get him away
Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush More patrons
step out from the diner
Buddy races up sees Mule bleeding and eyes Bush as he

the reins and leads Mule down Main street still holding the
brake handle

CARL

(GASPING)
T1ll kill him
Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain
Tom stares after Bush mirroring his fathers hatred

32 EXT BUSHS SHACK - DAY 32

As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack he feels the
beautiful stillness and mystery of the place He KNOCKS
timidly on the door pressing an ear to listen

BUDDY
Hello
Nothing He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away
and knocks a little louder Nothing He inches to the window
and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
slide away

CLICK
Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
him his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddys eyes

BUSH
Want to see in my house do you
BOOM Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
Buddys head

BUSH
Hows it look
Buddy closes his eyes his last words are for his wife
BUDDY
Oh Katie

Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but cant see
Frank He doesnt know whether to run for it or not

33 INT BUSHS SHACK - DAY 33
The shack is spare as a monks chamber but has wonderful
MADE FURNITURE in it

BUSH
Sit down
There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass

a small stool under the window and sits down low The wonder
of not being dead makes him look at everything with new

On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE
emerging from a block of wood

Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit
pieces covered with bacon and white gravy

BUSH
Its how you put things together
see Some things go some things
never will Indians said that
everything spoke to them Thats
how they made medicine and knew
what to eat Things talked to them
clear as we talk You believe that

BUDDY
I I dont know sir

BUSH
If you dont listen you wont hear
nothing
Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down
Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the
table legs run right into the top without screws or nails
BUDDY
Did you make this furniture sir
Never seen any like it Cant even
tell whats holding it up

BUSH
Magic
Buddy looks up Bush is dead serious The word lingers
Finally

respect and offer a good

BUSH

happened in town

BUDDY

BUSH
That crazy old son of a bitch tried
to beat a man to death for no
reason That it

Buddy is caught off guard by Bushs lucid candor and finds
himself automatically responding differently to him

BUDDY
Theres two sides to every story
As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddys old yellowed plate

BUSH
People say that But they dont
mean it They think what they think
and they dont want to know
anything else

BUDDY
Yes sir but I think people are so
scared of what they dont know that
they make things up to feel better
about it

BUSH
Like life after dying Heaven

BUDDY

(THINKS)
I hope that parts true dont you

(BEAT)

But I dont think we know the

actual truth about much of

anything I know I dont Im just

guessing most of the time

Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try
the

rabbit Fearing the worst Buddy bends into the steam takes

a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise

BUDDY
Lord thats good

BUS H

throw rocks through my window for

BUSH
I rather you did

BUDDY
(startledleans back)
Well When I was kid I heard you
killed some men in a fist fight

BUSH
Is that all
Bush leans back stone-faced
In the silence Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
carving of the mule on the window sill at the big ears and
long face that are being born from the rough block It makes
him smile But when he glances back Bush is staring a hole
through him

BUS H
Whats your name again

BUDDY

It sounds almost like a threat It shorts Buddy out He

eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and
hes been dismissed

BUSH
Fancy car for the dead

FRANK

BUDDY
(out of nowhere)
We say that funerals are For the
Living but we forget what that
means sometimes I guess
(to Bush but almost to

HIMSELF)

I was thinking about your funeral

party before I went to sleep last

night and I think I understand it a

little now When I was a kid my

folks where killed in a bad car

wreck and the people at the funeral

home they did the impossible as

far as I was concerned I dont

know what I wouldve done without

them And I remember wishing that

my mother and daddy were there to

see how beautiful they made

everything

Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked
Bush

glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at
the

world rushing by too fast All at once he gives in to it

for her The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl

Felix Bush

MATTIE

my ex-wife to kiss my

MATTIE
What makes you think shed show up

FRANK

Because Dear vultures are

constitutionally unable to ignore

the dead

Mattie grins which delights Frank no end

Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank

HORTON
Its that big wad of money of his
youre after
There is a crack in Rays disinterest that he tries to hide

RAY
What money is that

MATTIE
Felix has money
Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards

HORTON
He came to see me wanting a
funeral had a big old greasy ball
of money Talked like he thought he
could buy his way to heaven with
it

RAY

(SERIOUSLY)
How much has he got Maybe he can
Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
suddenly truly concerned

MATTIE
Is he sick Gus
Horton shrugs Frank notes the concern and doesnt like it
Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat

CARL
Ill tell you one damn thing aint
nobody gonna go to a funeral for
that son of a bitch
Mattie gives Carl a look

HORTON
Language

FRANK
They might Hes inviting everyone
who has a story about him to come
You could tell about him kicking
your ass Carl
Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him

RAY
Old man is going to ride the Weird
Train right into the ground isnt
he

FRANK
Wouldnt you like to know what
everybody says about you behind
your back Ray
(off his look)
Yeah probably not

HORTON
I already know way more about
people than I need to

MATTIE
Or want to

HORTON
Amen

FRANK

Lets play some cards

RAY
Oh for Gods sake face it Frank
youre broke
This is not about cards Its a declaration meant to
embarrass Frank in front of everyone Frank feels their eyes
on him as he starts to pull off his watch Ray waves it off

RAY
Please Ive won that 4 times
already

FRANK

Its who has it last that counts

CARL
Say what you want but if there
hadnt been anybody there the other
day he wouldve killed me And I
guarantee you it wouldnt have been
his first time
It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie

MATTIE
Everybody knows you started it
(off his glare)
Dont look at me like that I
remember when you were born You

were the sweetest little boy What

is wrong with you

Momentarily shamed Carls face softens and we can see a
better man there He struggles to hold on to it but

CARL
I made a mistake But theres a
line and he crossed it and
everybody knows that too Yall go
on and have a party with the devil
for his money but Ill dance on his
grave someday
Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out

HORTON
You kind of hate to admit it when
it comes to Carl but hes got a
point You dont know what Bush is
doing What if he just wants to get
everybody in one place so he can
turn his shotgun on them

MATTIE
He wouldnt

HORTON
I looked in his eyes The truth is
nobody knows what hes capable of
Maybe even he doesnt know
She looks into him Frank starts to deal the cards

RAY
Go ahead and lay your watch down
Frank But I am going to keep it
this time alright on principle

FRANK
I got an idea Lets try something
different

(TO RAY)
The cards in your sock Leaveem
there
Everyone freezes Ray shakes his head

RAY
What are you trying to pull now

FRANK
You really think youre that good
that nobody sees

RAY
Sees what

FRANK
You cheat at everything you do
Even at the bank you loan people
just enough to getem deeper in so
you can foreclose on them

RAY
You are a pathetic man Anda
goddamn

FRANK

Am I Then stand up and roll down
your socks
(a deep dark look)
Stand up or Ill stand you up
Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
irreversibly exposed and alone The sound of Franks chair
scraping the floor makes him jerk up

He walks out trying to find his old confident rhythm and
failing Everyone sits in uneasy silence

58 INT HALLWAY - NIGHT 58

Horton waves and walks out leaving the door open Frank
walks Mattie to the door helping with her coat trying to
work up his nerve to say

FRANK
Ill walk you home

MATTIE
No Thank you

MATTIE
Oh I dont know Thank you for

MATTIE

You came because you dont know
what to do with yourself
(off her look)
I slept on the same side of the bed
my whole life right But after my
wife left me I switched sides
just like that and never been able
to go back

MATTIE
When someone you love is gone you
can pour everything even a
lifetime of things into the place
where they were but its still
always empty

He sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a
at

we

million miles away She hardly glances up when she says
MATTIE

He stares after her wishing that she could see him the way
he sees her

ropes She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bushs

Bush is stricken and white He would stop her if he could

it is too late

She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
disappear if she blinks

Finally she whirls and looks at him her face a tortured
mask A strangled sob escapes her

He gets up and stands there staring at the floor

Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out

Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door

161 EXT BUSHS LANDFIELD - DAY 161

162 EXT BUSHS LANDFIELD - DAY 162

Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage

At the last second Bush stares at the big microphone and
stops unable to go on

Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
and looks out a the sea of white folks

CHARLIE
Im Reverend Charlie Jackson Felix
wants to continue with his funeral
And hes asked me to say a few
words
the

Just below the stage Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn
Charlie glances back at Bush turns inward searching for

words Finally he holds his hands out wide apart

CHARLIE
We like to imagine that good and
bad right and wrong are miles
apart But the truth is very often
theyre
(brings his hand together
and laces his fingers

TIGHTLY)
-all tangled up with each other
Bush raises his head and looks at Charlies back

CHARLIE
Some 40 years ago Felix Bush
dropped into my life and then
dropped out In between he built
the most beautiful sanctuary that
Ive ever seen A lot of wonderful
things happened in that church
Suddenly Bush breaks away moves up beside Charlie and puts
his hand on his shoulder

BUSH
Thank you Charlie Thank you
Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing
Bush stares at the microphone takes a breath and walks up
to it and looks out over the huge crowd

BUSH
Had to go clear to Illinois to find
somebody that had anything good to
say about me Hell of a thing
His voice booms out over the crowd startling him He looks
down sees Buddy Kathryn Frank and Horton
He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
there The crowd murmurs Finally
BUSH
Im not a smart man or a wise one
I dont know what kind of man I am
I was always restless thought Id
see the world But I didnt hardly
go nowhere on purpose

(BEAT)
Because because I did something
that I was ashamed of Something I
couldnt ever fix

(GLANCES AROUND)
Yall probably think you know what
youd do or what you wouldnt And
I wish you good luck with that I
really do

(BEAT)
When I told Charlie what Id done
he told me to confess to God and
the law and to to someone else
so I could get forgiveness But I
didnt want forgiveness

(BEAT)
I needed to hold on to what I did
to be sick from it every day of my
life So I never told nobody else
He stops not knowing how to go on The crowd has quieted
completely
As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces he
suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd

Matties here Seeing that Felix appears to alright her
face

changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred

The look takes Bushs breath away But he suddenly seems to

accept it as his due and when he talks it is only to her

BUSH
I fell in love with a married lady
talking

And somehow she fell in love with
me It was the only time that I
have been in love

(GATHERS HIMSELF)
We made a plan to run off and start
a new life but she didnt show up
at the time that we said wed meet
got a funny feeling and I went to
her house
Buddy Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now see Bush

just to her

BUSH
Her husband answered the door

(BEAT)

He had blood on him

For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized

BUSH
I hit him pretty hard knocked him
down Cant remember going upstairs
but I remember I saw a hammer on
the steps and it had blood and hair
on it
The crowd gasps Mattie is trembling

BUSH
I found her in the bedroom She was
crawling across the floor

(BEAT)

But before I could get to her and
help her up a kerosene lamp hit
the wall And then her husband
jumped on my back Funny what
happens sometimes when things go
wrong Its like the clock stops
and you have all the time in the
world to think could see that
her husband had set the downstairs
on fire before he came up

(BEAT)

(MORE )
He

BUSH (CONTD)
And as I was slamming his head into
the wall trying to get shed of
him I could see clear as anything
that it was all my fault If Id
just never spoke to her

(BEAT)
And as I was thinking about that I
saw that the lamp he threw had set
the room we were in on fire too
Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie

BUSH
And then I realized that I was on
fire I tried to put myself out but
I couldnt everything was

(BEAT)
I dropped him turned around and
saw her lying on the floor and
called her name She looked up at

me
(BEAT)

-and the next thing I knew I was

flying

A loud roar of fire and crushing timbers
163 EXT BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT 163

A man on fire bursts through the second story window of a
burning house He lands hard and rolls across the yard to
smother the flames

back into the hell But the fire is too hot and he cannot

164 EXT BUSHS LANDFIELD - DAY 164
The crowd is motionless Nothing is moving It is as if the

whole world has stopped Frank Buddy and Kathryn are
frozen
Bush and Mattie are looking into each other one anguished
soul to another

BUSH
I dont know how I got out the
window

(BEAT)

(MORE)

BUSH (CONTD)
No matter how many times I play it
in my mind I cant remember
jumping I thought I killed him
but maybe he pushed me I dont
know
(lost as ever)
I swear to you if I left her in
there everything I know about
myself is a lie But that dont
matter

(BEAT)
I didnt get her out Little Bit I
didnt Im sorry

165 INT BUSHS SHACK - DAY 165

haunted

Bush pulls Buddy aside Frank stares over at them but cant
hear what they are saying He moves over beside Mattie

FRANK

She looks up at Frank for a long moment her face softening

MATTIE

looked at him and thats something hell hold onto

HORTON
Can we get a ride our cars about 2
miles down the road
Everyone piles into the hearse There is no back seat so

all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides
It makes everyone smile Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
embrace then climbs in Bush looks in on them all for a long
moment all then closes the door

As the hearse moves out he waves to Buddy who is looking

the back window Buddy waves back
BUSH

(TO HIMSELF)
Look at that My funeral and
everybodys in there but me
The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away

The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful He looks down the
road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
toward him He squints recognizes her and his face fills
with a timeless love

stands

picture

Its a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree Mule

hitched to the wagon The three dog grave markers are
frosted

A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
tree It is freshly carved with Felix Elijah Bush A pot of
fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker

Bushs beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave

Frank Mattie Charlie Buddy Kathryn and Horton stand
beside the grave Several MEN with shovels wait near the
tree Charlies eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
which Bush would probably love

CHARLIE
Well Felix this ones for real I
guess I didnt actually see them
put you in the box so
Charlie glances over and notices Charlie on one of the
dogs grave markers He snorts and shakes his head

CHARLIE
Wherever you are youre probably
giving someone a hard time or
something wonderful and priceless
just to confuse them Not
everything can be figured out nor
everybody I wish you peace from
the burdens of your mind and heart
I wish it for us all
Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave Frank puts a hand
out to catch her should she should stumble She stares down
at the FB on the coffin opens her hand and lets the

of her sister drift down onto the coffin
169 EXT HILLSIDE - LATER 169
Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave Buddy and

Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie Buddy
tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank

BUDDY
A 50 on the outside all ones
inside Less than 100

FRANK
What

CHARLIE
I told you Nobody listens to the
preacher

Buddy pulls some papers from his coat

BUDDY
The day of the party he told me
about the will he had in the secret
drawer of his table He left the
raffle money to all of us
Everyone is shocked touched

BUDDY

(TO FRANK)
But you have to pay for Mules
upkeep for the rest of his life
Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him

BUDDY
And he set up a fund for the
upkeep of your church

CHARLIE
Whats the catch

BUDDY
No catch sir

CHARLIE
Still dont get it do you With
Felix theres always a catch

BUDDY
Maybe he just knew youd go crazy
wondering what it was
They all laugh and move down the hillside As the laughter
fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
had upon them Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
pot of yellow flowers His curiosity about the fearsome old
man has not abated Nor will it ever
