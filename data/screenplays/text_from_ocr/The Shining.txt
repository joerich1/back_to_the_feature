CUT TO

MCS JACK
JACK
Eh - formerly a school-teacher

WATSON (OFF)
What line of work are you in now

JACK
Im a writer um Teaching has
been more or less a way of making
ends meet

CUT TO
MCS WATSON
WATSON
Well this ought to be quite a
change for you
CUT TO

MCS JACK

JACK
Well Im looking for a change

ULLMAN (OFF)
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly and for once I
agree with them

CUT TO
MS ULLMAN
ULLMAN
Lets see where were we Yes I
was about to explain that eh our

season here runs from oh May 15th
to October 30th and then we close
down completely until the following
May

CUT TO
MCS JACK
JACK
Do you mind if I ask why you do
that It seems to me that the

skiing up here would be fantastic

ULLMAN (OFF)
Oh it sure would be
CUT TO
MS ULLMAN

ULLMAN (CONTD)
but the problem is the enormous
cost it would be to keep the road
to the Sidewinder open Its a
Its a 25 mile stretch of road -
gets an average of 20 feet of snow
during the winter and theres just
no way to make it economically
feasible to keep it clear When
the place was built in 1907 there
was very little interest in winter
sports and this site was chosen
for its seclusion and scenic beauty

CUT TO
MLS ULLMAN over WATSON and JACK
JACK
Well its certainly got plenty of
that
JACK laughs
ULLMAN

Thats right And did they give
you any idea in Denver about what
the job entails

JACK
Only in a very general way

ULLMAN
Well

CUT TO
MS ULLMAN

ULLMAN (CONTD)

the winters can be fantastically
cruel and the basic idea is
toto cope with the very costly
damage and depreciation which can
occur And this consists mainly of
running the boiler heating
different parts of the hotel ona
daily rotating basis repairing
damage as it occurs and doing
repairs so that the elements cant
get a foothold

CUT TO
MCS JACK

JACK
Well that sounds fine to me

ULLMAN grunts off
CUT TO
MS ULLMAN

ULLMAN
Physically its not a very
demanding job The only thing that
can get a bit trying up here during
the winter is eh the tremendous
sense of isolation

CUT TO
MCS JACK
JACK

Well that just happens to be
exactly what Im looking for Im

eh Im outlining a new writing
project and eh
(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
five months of peace is just what I
want
CUT TO
MS ULLMAN

ULLMAN
Thats very good Jack because eh
for some people eh solitude and
isolation

CUT TO

(MORE)

ULLMAN (CONTD)
been known to give a few people
second thoughts about the job

CUT TO

JACK
Im intrigued

CUT TO

ULLMAN
I dont suppose they eh told you
anything in Denver about the
tragedy we had up here during the
winter of 1970

MCS JACK

JACK
I dont believe they did

CUT TO

MS BILL WATSON

MS ULLMAN

MCS JACK

MS ULLMAN

ULLMAN (OFF)
Well my predecessor in this job

CUT TO

ULLMAN (CONTD)
hired a man named Charles Grady as
the winter caretaker He came up
here with his wife and two little
girls of about eight or ten And
he had a good employment record
good references and from what Ive
been told I mean he seemed like a
completely normal individual But
at some point during the winter he
must have suffered some kind of a
complete mental breakdown

(MORE)

ULLMAN (CONTD)
He ran amok and eh killed his
family with an axe

CUT TO

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONTD)
stacked them neatly in one of the
rooms in the West Wing and then he
um then he put eh both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth

CUT TO
laughs

ULLMAN
Yes it is Oh its still hard
for me to believe that it actually
happened here but it did and eh
I think you can appreciate why I
wanted to tell you about it

CUT TO

JACK
Ah I certainly can and eh I
also understand why your people in
Denver left it for you to tell me

CUT TO
laughing

ULLMAN
Well obviously some people can be

CUT TO

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONTD)
put off by the idea of staying
alone in a place where something
like that actually happened

JACK
Well you can rest assured Mr

Ullman thats not going to happen
with me and eg as far as my wife
is concerned I am sure shell be
absolutely fascinated when I tell
her about it Shes a confirmed
ghost story and horror film addict
