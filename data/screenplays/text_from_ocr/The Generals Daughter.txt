THE GENERAL’S DAUGHTER

FADE IN

A DARK RANGE

of open ground bordered by black pine Stillness The shrill
of insects Thermal clouds flowing overhead underlit orange

Heat lightning flickers Thunder sounds distantly Half-seen
in the dark a standing form
THE SILHOUETTE

of a soldier Helmeted Unmoving

AGAINST THE NIGHT °

the shape of a hand bound by rope Jagged yellow electricity
branches across the clouds

THE SOLDIER’S

features illuminate The face like a mask no expression A

face of hard plastic Eyeless

A WOMANS FACE

in deep shadow Staring upward in terror and sorrow A tear
glinting spilling slowly

HER VOICE
Father
THE SKY

boils in fury clouds churning as if in God’s answer Crazed
streaks of lightning fracture the sky

HER EYES

flare reflecting the flashing sky A shadow falls over them
The heavens rumble
EXT CID HEADQUARTERS - FALLS CHURCH VIRGINIA NIGHT

Hot rain falling At the lit entrance two burly MPs standing
sentry Above them a legend reading

The General came home a hero Hes
recently accepted an appointment to
the National Security Council where
he’ll receive his third star He’s
also considered a contender in the
next Presidential campaign
An exterior shot of the White House Then an office within a
cadre of administrative and military leaders gathered with the
President to effect strategic planning

BURNS (0S)
With the military drawdown General
Campbell’s election would be vital
to our national defense

General Burns sits in silhouette below a projector lens The
lights in the room come up Burns Commander of the CID two
stars on each collar of his battle-dress greens gazes gravely
along the length of a conference table

BURNS
The directive from Washington is to
clear the homicide at Fort Hadley
before the General leaves command

Several high-ranking officers and government officials regard
him solemnly Colonel Hellmann Director of Operations hair
shorn in a military mohawk face chisled and seamed wants to
clarify the directive

HELLMANN
When is change of command scheduled
General
Burns considers Hellmann significantly

BURNS
In one week Colonel

Hellmann’s adjutant Lt Rogers looks up from her notations
Hellmann tries not to openly scowl

HELLMANN
This may be a complex investigation
sir
BURNS

And a volatile one The General has
been struck by a tragedy We don’t
want to see it escalating into some
kind of scandal that smears the Army
or derails his future Tight
containment and rapid closure are
imperative What’s the situation
at Hadley

Hellmann restrains his opinion of the timeline
HELLMANN
The crime scene has been secured by
Special Agent in Charge Hawthorne
sir I’m assembling a team of our
top homicide people for deployment

BURNS
(frowning)
We have no homicide agents assigned
to Fort Hadley Colonel

Lieutenant Rogers slides a computer printout over to Hellmann
He scans it seeing a name that makes him unhappy

HELLMANN
Chief Warrant Officer Brenner He’s
on loan to Procurement and Fraud
Hellmann looks up from the print-out his eyes flint

HELLMANN
Hed be my last choice sir

Burns stands expression ominous
BURNS
You have the objective I want the
investigation opened immediately
EXT DIRT ROAD - OUTSKIRTS - MIDLAND GEORGIA - NIGHT

Headlights flare A Chevy pick-up truck bounces over a rutted
track exhaust rumbling

ELKINS (V0O)
(deep South)
That’s her up ahead
INT PICK-UP - NIGHT

Armory sergeant Dalbert Elkins jittery and sweating his face
eroded by hard times has his eyes riveted ahead

ELKINS (CONT’D)
HQ -- White Americanist Movement
The driver Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner stares through
the windshield Rugged well-built somewhere in his forties
at present he is gritty and unshaven wearing the same type of
battle-dress fatigues and insignia as Elkins

BRENNER
Looks like they run a pretty tight
budget Elkins

They take in the junked cars and old Harley frames rusting in
the weeds Ahead a flood light burning from a squalid shack
Elkins draws feverishly on a cigarette smoked to the filter

ELKINS
Hell these old boys put all their
money in ordnance They see what
we got I gar-an-tee theyll buy

EXT YARD SHACK - NIGHT

Brenner and Elkins stand out of the truck look to the porch
where several dark shapes lounge in the shadows

JOHNNY RAY
How y’all Dalbert

A backwoods baritone Elkins squints nervously

ELKINS
Up to no good son Heh heh

Johnny Ray saunters off the steps Bald head pirate’s beard
Goes about two-fifty Made of bricks An extreme individual

ELKINS
Johnny Ray this here’s my partner
Armory Sergeant White We go way
back He’s good wood

Brenners eyes cut sharply to Elkins He looks to Johnny Ray
who studies him with keen intensity his focus resting on his
name tag

JOHNNY RAY
Love that name

Brenner manages a grin noting a set of prison-issue lightning
bolts emblazoned on Johnny Ray’s forearm -- modified German SS
declaring allegiance to an Aryan brotherhood
BRENNER
Nice bolts

JOHNNY RAY
You like skin art

BRENNER
You bet

Johnny Ray grins turns A short stocky bruiser has appeared
behind him Deuce Shirtless heavily muscled Bleary-eyed

JOHNNY RAY
Sergeant White likes skin art

Deuce focuses on Brenner insolently Tattooed vividly across
his chest a rising eagle a swastika clutched in its talons

DEUCE
This here’s a vision for him Wants
to see more I’11l drop my pants

Low laughter from the porch Johnny Ray has a dangerous glint
in his eyes

JOHNNY RAY
Deuce is my road dawg

Deuce high-strung and violent lunges suddenly snarling his
teeth bared He barks rabidly snapping at Brenner An eerie
and dead-on imitation of a pit bull

More laughter Deuce growls warningly glowering Johnny Ray
chuckles cavernously observes Brenner

JOHNNY RAY
What ya’ll think White

BRENNER
Trained him good

Deuce woofs swaggering over to Brenners pick-up all eyes on
him He parks himself before a front tire back to them rips
open his pants The drumming of a forceful stream hitting the
sidewall ensues He lifts one leg

The porch crew rock in hilarity Brenner frowns Johnny Ray
wheezes his frame shaking

JOHNNY RAY
Ever seen a dawg didn’t like to piss
on a tire
Deuce finishes grinning drunkenly He ambles away leans in
the open trunk of a Cadillac parked beyond the light lifts a
beer pops it raises it to Brenner defiantly Brenner looks
at Johnny Ray unsmilingly

JOHNNY RAY
Show us what you got

BRENNER
Dalbert

Elkins hustles to the pick-up drops the gate snaps back the
tarp in the bed to expose a heavy BFVS machine gun ammo feed
belt looped through the breech

ELKINS
Combat-loaded seven-six-two coaxial
machine gun Raps-off sixhundred
armor-piercing rounds per minute
Got a hot two-dozen of ‘em Desert
Storm’s blown into Georgia boys

Johnny Ray stares transfixed He reaches for it

ELKINS
That’s a vehicle-mount item hoss

Johnny Ray heaves up the heavy rig steps away from the truck
He sweeps the barrel over the yard the bore swinging around
on the two armory sergeants Both men step back Johnny Ray
grinning levels the gun on Brenners pick-up

He prepares to fire There’s no trigger He looks up at the
two armory sergeants accusingly

BRENNER
Gimme that

Brenner cradles the weight of the gun angles the sights onto
the hazy shape of a coupe past the lights strikes the manual-
fire pad

The weapon rattles deafeningly flame spitting streaks of hot
blue tracer ripping a line through the air The sheet metal
caves in glass explodes chrome crumples the trunk lid blows
off turning in the air Deuce’s mouth is open wide in a yell
that is drowned out by the gunfire

The firing suddenly ceases ejected casings flying blue smoke
billowing Deuce’s scream cutting in
DEUCE
-- HOOOWEEEE That’s some screamin’
shit hog

Awed commentary rises from the porch Deuce blearily studies
Brenners target His slitted eyes jump wide in recognition

DEUCE
Wait a fuckin’ minute THAT’S MY
RIDE

His Cadillac comes into focus blown to scrap-metal Brenner
squints toward it feigning concern

BRENNER
Aww Jesus I’m sorry

DEUCE
He smoked my fuckin’ car

Brenner shrugs helplessly Deuce advances for him Johnny Ray
steps in first He towers over Brenner

JOHNNY RAY
Whod you brang Dalbert

Elkins offers a rattled smile The crew on the porch descend
expressions malignant Brenner edges back

BRENNER
Okay I’ve decided I don’t like
your attitude Whole thing’s off

The pack of men start to move on him in unison Brenner puts
the gun on them unused rounds visible in the belt

BRENNER
Let’s go Dalbert

Elkins stares at him increduously

INT PICK-UP - NIGHT

Brenner blasts the vehicle out of the yard the ring of angry
men falling behind in the rear window Elkins rips a hide-out
semi-auto from his waistband slams it on the dash

ELKINS
Man what the fuck is wrong with you
BRENNER
You just blew a two-month operation
bonehead

ELKINS
Fuck that noise They were ready to
deal
Brenner faces him snarling
BRENNER
They were on to us You introduced
me as Sergeant White
Elkins pauses in confusion

BRENNER
Look at my name tag Elkins

Elkins looks at Brenner BDU blouse the nametag black letters
on a white rectangle It reads Wright

ELKINS
Oh shit

He stares at his mistake chagrined Brenner disgusted rams
the truck up onto the dirt road

BRENNER

They caught it immediately It was

downhill after that
EXT DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
The truck roars clay-dust trailing as it recedes on the road

EXT TRAILER PARK - NEAR FORT HADLEY DAWN

Brenner’s truck rolls up in front of a weather-faded sign that
reads Whispering Pines Trailer Park He gets out wearily

Ahead of him a few run-down mobile homes among rows of vacant
trailer pads He walks up a path of rotted planks toward a
battered Airstream framed against a band of light to the East

INT BRENNER’S TRAILER - NIGHT

Brenner switches on the light It flickers weakly revealing
shabby green furniture plaid carpet mustard-colored drapes

He strips off his wet battle-dress blouse tosses it moves in

through the dim clutter to the galley area where he takes up a
bottle of scotch finds a glass pours a stiff one

IN THE LIVING AREA
someone is seated in the shadows motionless watching him

Brenner stands in the galley Without seeming to look toward
the living area he finds a second glass

BRENNER
You havin’ one of these Hawthorne

Rodney Hawthorne Special Agent in Charge of the CID unit at
Fort Hadley leans forward Fifty weathered black-skinned
hair dashed with gray eyes jaded Rumpled suit tie undone

HAWTHORNE
Can’t sneak up on you anymore

Brenner tilts the bottle pours out another drink

BRENNER
When could you

He moves into the living area profers the glass to Hawthorne
Hawthorne takes it They regard one another Years of rocky
history Friendship

BRENNER
This a social visit sir

Hawthorne drinks his scotch surveys the trailer’s disorder

HAWTHORNE
Nothin’ social about this place

BRENNER
This is my front

Brenner throws some clothes off the sofa sits down The two
men drink watching each other

BRENNER
Knew a kid in infantry training who
lived in this trailer Summer of
Sixty-Nine Had a beautiful wife

Hawthorne watches him

BRENNER
He gave his all in ‘Nam Won some
medals Came home wife was gone
Shed divorced him married a draft-
deferred civilian

HAWTHORNE
Ain’t that a bitch

BRENNER
What’s really a bitch dumb bastard
re-upped He’s still in the Army

Hawthorne lifts his glass to Brenner

HAWTHORNE
And no smarter Here’s to him
They drink
HAWTHORNE
What’s your progress on the weapons
operation
BRENNER
Negligible But then so was the
operation
Hawthrone stares at him
HAWTHORNE

You got your twenty in Maybe it’s
time you cashed out

Brenner considers his drink the muggy Georgia sky lighting up
the trailer windows

BRENNER
Where the hell would I go

Hawthorne shakes his head sadly

HAWTHORNE
Two years Brenner That’s how long
you’ve been missing in action Fort
Belvoir is done man It’s time to
move on

Brenner becomes uneasy It’s a sore subject

BRENNER
That’s not why you came over at o-
five-hundred is it sir

Hawthorne sets his glass down

HAWTHORNE
There’s been a murder on the post

BRENNER
Who was the victim

HAWTHORNE
The General’s daughter

Brenner is still jarred by the news

BRENNER
General Joe Campbell

HAWTHORNE
Affirmative Captain Ann Campbell
was found on Rifle Range Six last
night Strangled Possibly raped

The magnitude settles on Brenner
HAWTHORNE
It’s a hard blow She was the Golden
Girl of Fort Hadley

BRENNER
What’s the crime scene like

Hawthorne shakes his head solemnly Bad Strange
HAWTHORNE
This case is gonna be big Brenner
Real big I got you in

BRENNER
You what

HAWTHORNE
As of this moment you are the lead
investigator on a priority homicide

Brenner regards him in disbelief

BRENNER
You cleared this with Falls Church

HAWTHORNE
Colonel Hellmann’s under the gun to
get this solved

Brenner’s face darkens

BRENNER
You know Hellmann wont let me keep
this He’s got me on back-water
assignments He’ll send in a hand-
picked team

HAWTHORNE
I just said I got you in Youll
have to figure out how to stay in

Brenner tries to calculate the depth of what lies ahead

BRENNER
Case like this could be career-
suicide

HAWTHORNE

Unquestionably Want it or not

BRENNER
Yeah I want it I need a comeback
It’s just that

He looks at Hawthorne his confidence flagging

HAWTHORNE
Youll go up against the same things
you went up against last time Even
worse I can bring someone else in

BRENNER
No

Hawthorne stands a large man still powerful He moves past
Brenner stands on the porch gazing out at the steaming pine

HAWTHORNE
I‘m out of the Army next week

BRENNER
Is that your choice

HAWTHORNE
Ive given everything I have There
ain’t no more to give

He turns looks evenly at Brenner His life spent in service
to something greater than himself

BRENNER
You always said stand by the truth
that comes out of an investigation
Never look the other way And you
never did

His eyes convey his respect and an apology for falling short

HAWTHORNE
That’s the job Brenner Don’t ever
let ‘em tell you different

They shake hands in farewell

HAWTHORNE
Provost Marshal’s waitin’ for you at
the infantry training field He’ll
brief you Good luck

EXT INFANTRY TRAINING AREA - FORT HADLEY - DAWN

Major William Kent Provost Marshal spit-shined in his white
helmet and white pistol belt stands on the field watching
with icy eyes as Brenner walks toward him from his pick-up

Brenner wearing a blue tropical worsted suit snaps a salute
They have a past one of restrained animosity The day hangs
heavy with humidity

BRENNER
Major Kent

KENT
Mr Brenner You‘re looking worse
for the wear
BRENNER
Thanks You’re still a marvel of
preservation Were you born or
engineered

Kent smiles his frame conditioned and as hard as his outlook

Brenner nods

KENT
I was forged wise-ass By the US
Army

He knew that Kent looks at Brenner’s pick-up

KENT
You CID guys goin’ redneck

BRENNER
That’s my front

KENT
Now that’s subterfuge

BRENNER
You‘ve been studying the vocabulary
in your Reader’s Digest

KENT
I heard you were here so I wanted
some ten-cent words ready I’m

surprised you’re still in business

BRENNER
So am I How’s the baton Spilled
any brains with it lately

KENT
Oh sure You know me

BRENNER
Yeah So you’ll understand why I’m
not anxious to work with you again

KENT
Same here But it won’t be for long
You won’t go the distance

Brenner receives the prediction with steadiness

BRENNER
You can make book on it when you’re
off duty In the meantime this
case is under my control and youre
here to serve the CID

Kent’s eyes glitter with amused dislike A boom reverberates
from beyond the barracks the post cannon announcing reveille
A bugle call floating from remote loudspeakers

Both men conditioned by military custom their eyes on each
other raise their hands in salute The bugle echoes in the
hot stillness

EXT RIFLE RANGE ROAD FORT HADLEY - DAY

Kent’s white Taurus stops in the middle of a road bordered by
flat vistas Kent and Brenner get out They begin walking

KENT
Crime scene’s locked down The SAC
sent some warrant officers who seem
pretty useless and I posted MPs
It’s virgin nothing’s been touched
Except her of course

BRENNER
You’‘ve informed General Campbell and
his wife of her death

Kent nods a tic of emotion working at the line of his mouth

BRENNER
I want to see the General as soon as
possible
KENT

He taking it hard but I’ll see what
I can do

The control tower for the firing range rises ahead of them
KENT
It’s a nasty killing I hope to God
it was committed by a civilian

BRENNER
Who made positive identification

KENT
A Sergeant St John found the body
He was on guard duty with her last
night And I knew her

BRENNER
Fill me in

KENT
She was an instructor Psychological
Operations School West Point
Smart Good-looking Standing tall
Poster girl Put her name on all the
duty rosters to set an example

Brenner hears possible invective files it for later review

BRENNER
Was she armed last night

KENT
She had her sidearm

Ahead of them a sand-colored humvee parked at the roadside

BRENNER
Why was Sergeant St John out here

KENT
Captain Campbell left headquarters
to check the guard posts and didn’t
return St John got concerned and
tried to locate her Found her jeep
parked here

They approach the humvee Brenner peers beneath the vehicle
then touches the exhaust pipe He moves to the window looks
inside sees a purse on the seat

BRENNER
Have you questioned the guard at the
nearest post

KENT
PFC Robbins She heard nothing but
saw some headlights

Brenner opens the door turns the purse over sorting through
the contents He lifts a ring of keys
os me

BRENNER
Detain St John and Robbins I’1l
want to talk to them

They walk toward the fire control tower where a number of MPs
and vehicles are stationed

EXT RIFLE RANGE SIX - DAY

Brenner and Kent move past the tower The firing range comes
in view a long expanse of open terrain black and white lane
markers receding to 500 hundred meters The sun hovers like

a disc of fire Brenner shields his eyes

A series of berms ahead Atop each pop-up targets simulating
soldiers with rifles Two MPs stand at parade rest at a berm
fifty meters ahead They salute as Brenner and Kent approach

Brenner regards the target on the berm its green plastic face
staring eyelessly at the sun He finds it unsettling

BRENNER
Where are the warrant officers the
SAC sent over

Kent looks to the MP’s one male one female both young and
pale under the shade of their helmets

MALE MP
One of ‘em’s losing his breakfast in
the bushes sir

They round the berm Brenner halts looks to the dirt ahead

Bluebottle flies whip through the air Her white naked flesh
glares in the hard light She lies stripped on her back her
wrists and ankles bound to plastic tent pegs

Captain Ann Campbell She is no more than thirty Once quite
lovely now drained vacant -- the triangle of her pubic hair
her mouth open tongue and teeth exposed her eyes rolled back
into her head Bitten deep into her neck a green nylon cord
knotted tightly

Brenner stares at the body reminded sharply and painfully of
another death another woman He turns from the image walks
away a few paces helpless anger filling him He looks down

at her bra filmy silk lying cast in the weeds near his feet

KENT
I should mention there’s a rape
counselor assigned to this case

Kent is behind him

BRENNER
The victim doesn’t need counseling
Major She’s dead

Kent clears his throat Brenner turns Special Agent Cynthia
Sunhill has arrived She stares at the victim silent outrage
in her eyes then at Brenner Late twenties trim attractive
without vanity features shaded by an edge a resolve within

SUNHILL
Warrant Officer Sunhill Mr Brenner
I was called in from Fort Stewart to
assist in this investigation

Brenner assesses her registering her correctness her youth
and her spiky attitude She promises to be a pain in the ass

BRENNER
By whom

SUNHILL
By Colonel Hellmanns office

She returns Brenner’s examination with her own her expression
indicating unfavorable conclusions

BRENNER
You’re a Grade One Ms Sunhill
Is Hellmann short-handed

Sunhill’s eyes glint stonily

SUNHILL
He’s assembling his team from Falls
Church And for the record when I
heard you were here I asked myself
the same question

Kent utters a short mocking laugh

BRENNER
Do we know each other

SUNHILL
Your reputation precedes you

BRENNER
Hope you’re not here to fax reports
on my conduct You’d never get off
the line

SUNHILL
I’m here because I have specialized
training in sexual assault cases

BRENNER
This may not be a sexual assault
An investigator’s trained not to
form conclusions in advance Says
so in the manual

She regards him thinly her eyes glittering

SUNHILL
Why don’t we get on with it Mr
Brenner

BRENNER

You go first

The body is between them they both kneel down Sunhill looks
at the victim’s naked skin withering under the heat

SUNHILL
Rigor has commenced Lividity in the
thighs and buttocks

Brenner watches her

BRENNER
Indicating death occurred when

SUNHILL
Seven eight hours ago Consistent
with the report

She pauses then forces her gaze to the neck the cord bedded
tightly into it

SUNHILL
Other than the ligature marks made
by the rope there are no apparent
bruises lacerations or bite marks

She glances at him Brenner is unimpressed Her face darkens
and she looks back to the body She stares at the eyes takes
her thumb to an eyelid hesitantly
Flies snap past her face

SUNHILL
The corneas have clouded Small
spotty hemorrhages in the lining
of the lids Presumptive evidence
of death by asphyxia

BRENNER
What about the hands and nails

Campbell’s stiffened hands in her own

She lowers her

Brenner rises

SUNHILL
There are no defensive marks No
blood or dirt under the nails

BRENNER
Go on

gaze to the abdominal region

SUNHILL
There’s no evidence of semen around
the thighs or the genital area
No outward signs of penetration

picks up the bra offers it to her

BRENNER
And this

SUNHILL
No rips or tears The clasp is not
bent or broken

BRENNER
So far there’s no support for sexual
assault In fact there are no signs

of a struggle Not on the victim and

not in the immediate area

Sunhill stands keeping her face even

SUNHILL
Youre saying she disrobed of her
own accord had herself staked out
and strangled

BRENNER
I‘m not saying anything yet Thank
you Ms Sunhill

Pressing herself she takes one of

Brenner crouches stares into Captain Campbell’s vacant face
for a long time Sunhill watches him wondering whether she
hates him or not Probably she does Kent and the two MPs
stand sweating silently in the sun

Brenner eyes fixed seems to make a resolution He rises

BRENNER
Where did Captain Campbell reside
Major
KENT

Off post in Midland I’d recommend
you clear a civilian search warrant
through Chief Yardley He’s a real
stickler for jurisdiction

Brenner ignores the advice scanning the range

BRENNER
Where’s her uniform and dogtags Her
Boots Pistol

KENT
We didn’t find ‘em

BRENNER
Has anyone called in the forensic
team from Fort Gillem

SUNHILL
I did

BRENNER
Major Kent can you set up a grid
search excluding an area of fifty
meters around the body Have your
people to collect anything that’s
not part of the landscape

KENT
This a trash detail

BRENNER
It’s an Army detail -- by-the-book --
lots of extra work You like that

Kent watches him face blank the light of hatred in his eyes

BRENNER

I need Captain Campbell’s medical
and personnel files sealed and in
your office by noon Major Tape
off her office impound her humvee
and her private vehicle Get me

a list of everyone who’s been here
for disqualifying footprints And
tell Public Affairs were running a
black-out on this

Kent nods curtly moves off Brenner looks at Sunhill and she
sees for the first time how haggard he is

BRENNER
How you feeling Ms Sunhill
SUNHILL
You want the truth
BRENNER
Hit me
SUNHILL

I want to nail the motherfucker
who did this to the wall

Brenner is taken off guard by the force of her language He’s
starting to reassess her

BRENNER
We have something in common Did
you bring a car
EXT VICTORY HIGHWAY - MIDLAND - NEAR FORT HADLEY - DAY
A new convertible Mustang GT moves rapidly down a wide street
bordered by Georgia pine
INT MUSTANG - DAY

Sunhill drives dark glasses on eyes on the road Brenner is
is making notations a folder on his lap He stops writing
BRENNER
Okay I’ve got a theory Since we
saw no signs of a struggle we have
to consider the possibility Captain
Campbell had a preplanned rendezvous
with a lover I’m talking bondage
Ms Sunhill Consenting partners

SUNHILL
That’s a typical male fantasy She
consented to being bound in the dirt
like an animal

BRENNER
I don’t know that the animal kingdom
enters into it

Sunhill stares ahead heat in her eyes

SUNHILL
I don’t think you know women Mr
Brenner I’m reasonably sure
you’re not cohabitating with one

He grins She’s outspoken smart aggressive and she really

wants to nail him

BRENNER
I did once But the cave got too
cramped

Sunhill shakes her head to herself

SUNHILL
Thank you Your analogy helps me
understand who I’1l be dealing with

BRENNER
Glad to be of assistance Pull into
that driveway please

She sees a sign at gated drive Victory Gardens
of brick-fascade townhomes

SUNHILL
I thought you were going by-the-book

BRENNER
Give or take a chapter

A complex

EXT REAR PATIO - CAMPBELL’S UNIT - VICTORY GARDENS - DAY

They enter a fenced area Potted plants a barbecue a chaise
lounge Brenner presses the buzzer at the kitchen door

-SUNHILL
This is illegal Mr Brenner You’re
jeopardizing the case not to mention
your career

Brenner takes out Campbell’s key ring sorts through the keys
BRENNER
My career’s been in jeopardy for some
time Ms Sunhill

The latch clicks he swings open the door peers into the dark
inside He turns to Sunhill

BRENNER
You armed

SUNHILL
Yes

BRENNER

Back me up

He moves inside

INT CAMPBELL’S KITCHEN - DAY

Dim light blinds drawn Gleaming sterile Brenner moves to
a door at the end of the kitchen eases it open looks inside
closes it He silently swings a chair out from the table and
props it under the knob Sunhill moves up her automatic out

BRENNER
Basement We’ll check it last
INT CAMBELL’S BEDROOMSTUDY - DAY
Simple and ordinary decor A tightly-made bed No frills no
sentiment Order Brenner stands at an open closet the rack

hung precisly with civilian clothes and uniforms

BRENNER
This place is sanitized

Sunhill replaces her automatic in her purse Brenner strolls
around the room moves into the bathroom back out Walks to
an alcove containing shelving with books Studies the titles

BRENNER
The complete works of Friedrich
Nietzsche Remember this old
favorite “In revenge and love
woman is more barbarous than man

Sunhill stands at the dresser examining an open jewelry box

SUNHILL
Spare me the misogyny Mr Brenner

Brenner shrugs He turns to the wall nearby scans the framed
plaques awards commendations

BRENNER
American Red Cross Victory Gardens
Safety Council Volunteer work at
Children’s Hospital

He looks over at her

BRENNER
She was perfect in every way Made
in the USA White-glove immaculate

SUNHILL
Is that a clue

His gaze falls on a flat carrying case on a shelf
BRENNER
Everything is a clue Sunhill The
lack of clues is a clue
He unzips the case exposing a notebook computer
SUNHILL
I guess I haven’t progressed to that
level yet Sounds Zen
BRENNER
This lady had no private life Does
that not strike you as odd
He considers her buttoned-down aspect

BRENNER
Well maybe not

SUNHILL
That’s very comic Maybe she was
what she was An unimpeachable and
dedicated officer
He removes the notebook computer from the case
BRENNER
Sorry I don’t buy it -- I want this
Can you fit it in your handbag

SUNHILL
We entered illegally You know any
evidence we find won’t be admissible

He crosses to her standing near and sizing up her handbag
BRENNER
We admit it into our strategy -- that
is great perfume

He hands her the computer She regards him with vigilance

SUNHILL
I dont wear perfume

BRENNER
Now I’m really intrigued

SUNHILL
You‘re not exempt from harassment
charges Brenner
She moves to the door expression stern

SUNHILL
Lets go down to the basement

Brenner’s eyes light up

BRENNER
But we have this great bedroom

Brenner watches her stalk down the stairs enjoying himself

INT CAMPBELL’S BASEMENT - DAY

her battle dress uniform and full field gear

They move toward it Campbell holds a radiotelephone checks

Well it’s subliminal How can I
point to it

SUNHILL

Your mind runs in very small circles

BRENNER
It’s only a thread Sunhill Part of
a vast fabric

She moves away Brenner remains gazing at the woman’s image
appreciating her beauty and wondering who really lived there

Campbells face looms larger frozen forever in printers ink

SUNHILL (0S)
I think you better look at this

He turns She has the broom closet door open staring within

He moves up next to her Inside the closet on a shelf above
the brooms and mops a black camcorder It rests on its base
turned to the rear of the closet lens aimed against the wall

Brenner reaches in slides the camera back revealing a gap in
the plaster where the lens met the wall They exchange a look
and Brenner presses in peering at the gap

SUNHILL
Is something behind there

BRENNER
Maybe It’s dark I can’t see in

Heavy footsteps shudder the ceiling The agents whip around
Sunhill wrestles her pistol free The basement stairs creak
A large man in a suit is descending

Brenner nudges the closet door shut The man stops short his
eyes lighting on them Heavy face pitted skin Built like a
refrigerator Sunhill trains her semi-auto on him

SUNHILL

Ignoring her weapon he raises a police radio-phone thumbs it
on the line crackling

ordered to secure this townhouse
over to goddamn Victory Gardens

His face inflames staring at the intruders the phone hisses

The floor shakes overhead Two eager and oversized patrolman
clamber down the stairs stopping short They see the agents
the gun both grab at their holsters Yardley growls at them

YARDLEY

Brenner glances at Sunhill He nods to her weapon Maybe it
would be a good idea to put it away She does Brenner one-
hands his wallet flashing his badge

BRENNER
Agents Brenner and Sunhill From
Fort Hadley Were investigating
the homicide of Captain Campbell

Yardley moves into the basement the patrolmen trailing him
He stands across from the agents clearly restraining a will
to do harm His voice is native Dixie and under hard duress

YARDLEY
I been notified Did you obtain a
search warrant Mr Brenner

Sunhill glances at Brenner shifting her handbag the notebook
computer buldging inside it

BRENNER
We’re working on it

Yardley breathes out a long sigh His patrolmen take menacing
positions behind him

- YARDLEY
I am very upset that you are here

Sunhill commanding and smart steps forward

SUNHILL
Chief Yardley this is a priority
investigation It’s important our
agencies work in a combined effort
on this

Yardley gazes on her curiously He shakes his head bemused

YARDLEY
Women in the Army

He gestures toward the poster of Captain Campbell

YARDELY
Look at that She’s got sixty pounds
of field gear How’s she gonna squat
to pee

The patrolmen chuckle appreciatively Sunhill’s face tightens
in anger Brenner gives her a sidelong glance She should’ve
known better

YARDLEY
Come here Wade

Wade the larger of the patrolman assumes a serious official
demeanor steps next to the Chief

YARDLEY
It was your responsibility to seal
these premises am I correct

WADE
Chief I had to get fueled

Yardley shakes his head No excuses Wade becomes morose

WADE
Yes sir It was

YARDLEY
And you know were family and that I
depend on your police-work

WADE
Yes sir

YARDLEY
Well then there’s nothing more for
me to verbalize is there

Wade nods swallows closes his eyes

WADE
No sir

Yardley throws a massive right Wham Wade goes down Hard

BRENNER
Jesus

The agents stunned gape at the fallen patrolman Sunhill’s
handbag slips from her arm the computer in it clanking as it
hits the floor She looks down at it then to Brenner who is
staring at her warningly Yardley sucks on his torn knuckles
seems not to have noticed

YARDLEY
Now Mr Brenner Let me explain
somethin’ I work on a cooperative
basis with Fort Hadley But you got
to get the proper clearances

Wade groans lurching to his hands and knees mouth streaming
blood Without looking at him Yardley lowers a handkerchief
into his reach

YARDLEY (CONT‘D)

Above all sir you got to be sure
you talk to me before you so much
as step in a pile of dogshit that’s
situated on civilian property Am
I makin’ myself understood

Brenner looks to the second patrolman who observes his fallen
partner neutrally Apparently he’s seen it before Sunhill
casually recovers her handbag

BRENNER

other guy go down

A violent blur of fangs and fur slams against the wires of its
cage -- a rhesus monkey shrieking and yammering its fangs on
prominent display Past it a line of rattling cages occupied
by crazed primates raising a cacaphonous din

At a lab counter a man in white working on a computer among
a clutter of electronic equipment Brenner and Sunhill stand
in the open doorway

BRENNER

Colonel Moore peers up at them lips twisted He turns a knob
on an amplifier an ultrasonic wave shudders the racket from
the cages instantly ceases A dozen monkeys stare silently at
him red-eyed with fear and hatred

Moore regards the agents A short man High domed forehead
Messianic eyes behind smeared glasses Lab coat well-sprayed
with monkey piss

Shocking I’m in a state of profound
distress

Did you have a close relationship
with the deceased Colonel

MOORE
I considered her my protege

SUNHILL
How would you describe her

MOORE
Skilled intelligent charismatic
courageous and utterly dedicated

BRENNER
Did she have any good qualities
Moores eyes become scalpels

The agents are

BRENNER
That was a joke Colonel

MOORE
This is hardly an appropriate time
for levity

BRENNER
Sorry sir the left side of my brain
got the better of me Was Captain

Campbell seeing anybody Dating A
boyfriend

MOORE
Captain Campbell considered men weak
and contemptible

SUNHILL
This was a personal view she shared
with you

MOORE
Professionally I was her therapist

given pause Brenner wants some clarification

BRENNER
You provided Captain Campbell with
psychological counseling Colonel

Moore’s glasses glint frostily Brenner’s implication evident

MOORE
You’re very quick aren’t you

BRENNER
We’ll need your transcripts

MOORE
There are no transcripts That was
our arrangement

BRENNER
That’s highly unusual isn’t it

MOORE
The term unusual has no application
in the frontier of psychology

BRENNER
Well we still use it out here in the
frontier of homicide Colonel And
we think it’s unusual that as her
superior and her therapist you’re not
cooperating in this investigation

A rhesus shrieks out the agents jump Moore unfazed stands
before the cage He and the monkey lock eyes

MOORE
Youve stumbled into the wrong door
Mr Brenner When and if you
stumble into the right one the real
investigation will begin

The animal shrinks before Moore’s will Its black primordial
eyes recording him Mortal enemy

BRENNER
You’re a very spooky man Colonel
If you’re withholding information
relevant to this case I’1l make
sure you see a court martial

Moore looks up from the cage triumphant Man over beast He
moves to the amplifier rests his hand on the knob

MOORE
I can’t tell you how frightened I am
If I’m a suspect arrest me and I’11
exercise my rights as such -- if not
then I’m extremely busy

paralyzing free-floating anxiety

Sir

He transfers his gaze to Brenner charm drained

HELLMANN
I see that youve been debauching
yourself

BRENNER

It’s called lack of sleep sir

HELLMANN
I‘m going to remedy that I intend
to replace you

Brenner subverts an urge to kill him A staff car is pulling

up nearby Hellmann’s transport to the General’s house

group starts walking toward it

BRENNER
Yes sir But I don’t think that
would be wise

HELLMANN
Why wouldnt it be wise

They pass a line of dark and lethal AH-64 Apache helicopters

BRENNER
This is a very sensitive case sir
And our findings so far say it’s
gonna get a lot more sensitive A
team will step all over it You
need a low-profile a delicate hand

HELLMANN
Delicacy isn’t a word that occurs to
me when I think of you Mr Brenner

BRENNER
That’s where Ms Sunhill comes in
sir My expertise her finesse

Sunhill throws a stabbing look at Brenner

BRENNER
This case gets very tangled Colonel
Were already untying the knots We
can bring it home In record time

HELLMANN
Is this a clumsy attempt to deceive
me Ms Sunhill

They both look at her

SUNHILL
We have some strong leads sir

HELLMANN
Twelve hours into the investigation
Id expect nothing less I’m certain
whatever leads you have will be put
to good use by the incoming team of
which you will be a part

Sunhill bleakly considers her part with the team They arrive
at the staff car The driver salutes

SUNHILL
Sir we expect a major break in the
investigation by tonight
Hellmann turns his full attention on her She’s in it now

HELLMANN
A major break

Brenner’s eyes urge her to plunge ahead
SUNHILL
Yes sir It’s going to blow this
case wide open
Hellmann stares measuredly at her
HELLMANN

I’m leaving at o-six-hundred You
have til then to substantiate that

He pauses before entering the car turning to Brenner

HELLMANN
If it goes unsubstantiated you Mr
Brenner will answer to a board of
inquiry seven steely-eyed officers
who will eat your ass for lunch
Long overdue in my opinion

He closes the door The agents stand in the twilight watching
the car drive away

BRENNER
You’re coming around

SUNHILL
We have maybe twelve hours What
if there isn’t anything behind that
basement wall

BRENNER
Then I’1l have some company at the
top of Hellmann’s shit list

SUNHILL
Why are you on that list

They begin toward her car She stares insistently at him

BRENNER
It’s under the bridge Sunhill

SUNHILL
That’s not good enough

Brenner keeps walking She grabs his arm halting him eyes
intense on his

SUNHILL
You were a top agent a few years ago
What happened

Brenner frowns looking out over the airfield heat rising in
the red twilight

BRENNER
There was a case A captain who was
beating his wife up on a regular
basis I had enough for an arrest --
felony battery

She waits for more Brenner is not forthcoming

SUNHILL
That’s it

BRENNER

No She told me she was terrified
he’d end up killing her But the
captain had an outstanding record
and some high-ranking friends It
was strongly suggested I should act
in the best interests of the Army
and drop it

She surmises the rest from his grim profile

SUNHILL
But you didn’t

BRENNER
No I did And ten days later he
beat her to death with his hands

He faces her his eyes stark An Army chopper rams overhead
lights blinking in the red sky

BRENNER
There was an inquiry Same people
who wanted the case dropped turned
around and helped rake me over the
coals Hellmann was one ‘em But
they were right about one thing --
I didn’t do my job

Sunhill watches him somberly

BRENNER
It comes down to this -- The Army’s
all I have I didn’t want to risk
it So I went along and she lost
her life for it I’m only on this
case because an old friend threw me
a rope

met the wall

He ducks out of the closet searching along the wall with his

bad but not so bad that Campbell can’t be identified again

stares into it Closing in on her rear at high speed a large
rust-colored vehicle

Brenner turns around as the truck looms up in the back window
It rides their bumper then pulls out to pass engine roaring

The agents look over to it as it comes up even A big dented
flatbed two men in the cab the driver huge the passenger
leaning out his window leering at them with a strange leather
harness clamped to his face

The truck pulls ahead Chained to the back a greasy pit bull
lunging against his chain and barking dementedly The flatbed
shoots up the road exhaust ripping the air harness-face half
out his window his jubilant howl trailing

Sunhill swerves the car jarred by the exhibition

SUNHILL
Good lord Who the hell is that

Brenner stares ahead grimly He knows who it is
SUNHILL

farming implement that rushes up in the headlights a bladed
disk harrow pulled broadside in their path

EXT MUSTANG - ROAD - NIGHT

The brakes scorch the car plows sideways toward the machinery
in screen of tire smoke narrowly avoiding the blades leaving
the road cleaving a wire fence slamming through brush right
hand wheels dropping into a drainage ditch

The car skids aslant metal shearing sparks flying comes at
last to a grinding halt under the trees

The interior turned at an angle the driver’s airbag inflated
Sunhill slides out from behind it tumbles against Brenner who
is slung tight against his seatbelt He looks dazedly out his
window the bottom of the ditch a foot and half from his face

In the hot quiet a backwoods baritone floats from the trees

VOICE (0S)
Tear ‘em up

Clawed feet scrabble Something is bounding through brush and
moving rapidly toward them Brenner and Sunhill stare out the
window panic in their eyes

SUNHILL
Brenner The dog

Sunhill lifts herself off Brenner He struggles furiously to
free himself as the sound of cracking brush and pounding paws
closes in

Brenner’s arm is pinned by his weight He tries to wrench it
loose A malevolent rumble They freeze

Above them in the dark at the top of the ditch the pit bull
wedge-headed fangs glistening It scans them with a killer’s
eyes shoulders and chest bunched with muscle

SUNHILL
Brenner do something

The dog’s heavy jaws drop open strings of spittle suspending

BRENNER
Nice doggy

The animal leaps in flying snarl Brenner wrests his service
automatic from his shoulder holster The gun cracks bucking
in his hand the dog yelps slain in mid-leap It soars over
them and thumps solidly against the roof of the car

Someone screams from the trees an anguished vengeful howl

A deeper voice is heard in reprimand The doors of a vehicle
clunk closed a big engine fires The flatbed pulls away the
sound of it receding

Brenner and Sunhill sag drained In a few moments the sound
of another vehicle is heard They raise up listening as it
swerves suddenly off the asphalt bumps slowly up through the
weeds stops nearby The door opens footsteps crunch closer

Brenner angles his pistol toward the top of the ditch A pair
of boots appear above them Chief Yardley squats down with a
flashlight examing the Mustang’s roof

YARDLEY
Damn that’s an ugly dog Anybody
hurt down there

The light probes Brenner’s face

Nope Just chillin’

himself out of the window kneels in the ditch to help Sunhill

man to another hold off for a while
I can help you find the real culprit

Brenner shakes his head

KENT
Thirty years as a military policeman
in this division Brenner I want

to leave with something

BRENNER
I’m sorry Major

Kent becomes deadly silent Brenner walks to his truck gets
in starts it He looks at Kent as he rolls by Kent stands
watching him forbiddingly

EXT ROAD - RIFLE RANGE SIX - DAY

Brenner’s truck moves past an MP checkpoint It drives past a
long row of cars vans belonging to the forensic team Ahead
Sunhill waiting for him outside a rental car Brenner parks
gets out moves up to her M-16 gunfire crackles from nearby

SUNHILL
We have an appointment with General
Campbell at eighteen-hundred hours

BRENNER
Good

SUNHILL
What did Kent give you

BRENNER
He’s coming unwound He denied any
part in the killing threw Yardley
at me

SUNHILL
Kent Yardley Moore And how many
others Any one of them could’ve had
a motive

They begin walking toward the fire control tower Beyond it
the peak of the team’s canvas pavillion

SUNHILL
I got the report to Hellmann Over
breakfast at the OC He said hed
review it but I didn’t like the
look in his eyes

BRENNER
Maybe his croissant was stale

Sunhill regards him tensely

Brenner frowns

EXT PAVILLION

SUNHILL
We’re in trouble Brenner Even if
he keeps us This case is not a
straight line It’s warped We’ll
never solve it before the General
leaves command

BRENNER

Relax Sunhill We have seven days
SUNHILL

Six
BRENNER

Who’s counting

- RANGE SIX - DAY

Brenner and Sunhill move down a path of tarpaulin toward the
berms where the huge green open-sided pavillion is erected
over the site of the murder

Forensic staff
firing cameras

swarm the area taking casts of indentations
scouring staked-off quadrants on their hands

and knees to collect evidence

Officer in Charge Cal Seiver approaches them A well-trained
neurotic short and bald wearing a dusty BDU cap and forever
piecing together chaos

Seiver looks at

SEIVER
The entire fucking world danced
around the body Mr Brenner

BRENNER
Agent Sunhill Chief Warrant Officer
Seiver

SEIVER
Pleased to meet you Ms Sunhill

BRENNER
Any non-military footprints

their shoes
SEIVER
Yours and hers I’11 need the shoes
for disqualifying Everything else
is boots Forensics ain’t easy when
everyone’s wearing the same fucking
thing

He takes off his cap mops sweat from his bald head

BRENNER
New memo from the Pentagon Seiver
You are not short and bald You’re
a vertically challenged man of scalp

Seiver looks at Sunhill

SEIVER
You have to work with this guy I
extend my sympathies

SUNHILL
Gratefully accepted Did you find
any indications of a sexual assault
Mr Seiver

SEIVER
We ran some tests Pathologist will
have the final word but my take on
it is she wasn’t raped

Brenner gives Sunhill a meaningful glance

BRENNER
What else do you have at this point

SEIVER
We dusted for latent prints vacuumed
for trace evidence analyzed for tool
marks and ran some seriology tests
To answer your question we have shit
at this point

Brenner glances at his watch

BRENNER
All right We requisitioned an empty
hangar over at Jordon Field You can
set up your lab and offices there

SEIVER
Puckin’ spectacular

BRENNER
All reports and inquiries go to me
sealed and confidential Instruct
your people not to talk to anyone
particularly the Provost Marshal

Seiver nods registering the implication here

SEIVER
How’d you pull this case Brenner

BRENNER
Dumb luck
INT - BRENNER’S TRUCK - ROAD - FORT HADLEY EVENING
Brenner drives Sunhill jots in her notebook evergreen blurs
BRENNER
Okay No signs of struggle no signs
of rape Consensual Orchestrated

Ritualistic What’s that suggest

SUNHILL
A sacrifice

He turns to her struck by the revelation

BRENNER
A sacrifice That’s dead-on But
to what

SUNHILL

And by whom Our killer’s hiding
in a suspect list that’s starting
to read like the phone book

BRENNER

Well have to flush him out
SUNHILL

How
BRENNER

We throw out the rules

SUNHILL
Oh God

Brenner loosens his tie

BRENNER
Had a homicide suspect once I knew
he did it He knew he did it But
we had no physical evidence He was
carrying this terrible secret around
Went to the post chapel every Sunday

SUNHILL
I know -- you planted the evidence
He gives her a narrow look
BRENNER

I capitalized on his sense of guilt
Got a confession

SUNHILL

How did you get a confession
BRENNER

In the confessional I sat in for

the chaplain

SUNHILL
You’ve got to be kidding

BRENNER
The man bared his soul to me I got
everything Then I held my badge up
to the grill He was expecting Hail
Marys It would have been thrown
out in court but after that how
could he deny it So he signed the
real thing

SUNHILL
That’s reprehensible

BRENNER
Of course it is So was the crime
I just leveled the playing field
And that’s my point That’s how we
get this guy

Sunhill eyes him envisioning the end of her career Brenner
slows the truck Ahead a drive shaded by magnolias a wooden
marker reading “Residence of General Joseph Campbell

They turn up the drive Coming into view an antebellum relic
of the Old South White columns white iron balustrades sun
declining behind the roofline

EXT PORCH - GENERALS RESIDENCE - EVENING
They stand on the porch Brenner chimes the bell

SUNHILL
I’m nervous as hell

BRENNER
Let me do the talking

SUNHILL
That’s what I’m nervous about

The door opens A young lieutenant appears Handsome broad-
shouldered His name tag reads “Elby”

BRENNER
Warrant Officers Brenner and Sunhill
to see General Campbell

ELBY
I’m the General’s adjutant Chief of
Staff Colonel Fowler wishes to speak
with you beforehand

INT GENERAL’S RESIDENCE - EVENING

The agents follow Elby to a waiting room He departs They
remain standing tense eyeing the period-style furnishings

In the doorway Colonel Fowler in dress-greens with colonel’s
eagles and insignia of the General Staff Imposing and case-
hardened a well-used weapon of a man He moves in his name
tag introducing him Brenner and Sunhill salute

FOWLER
Please be seated

They take seats Fowler sits across from them He examines
them sternly his eyes recording every detail the slash of
an old battle scar angling from ear to jawline

FOWLER
Forgive the recon I wanted to see
who was coming into the General’s
house It’s ingrained singling out
friends from enemies

His gaze meets Brenner’s
BRENNER
Hope you’re not going to radio in
the rockets sir

FOWLER
Why Can’t you duck an incoming

BRENNER
With a day’s advance notice

Fowler sits back considering him

FOWLER
Hundred and Ninety-Fourth battalion
Bantangan Peninsula LZ Dotty You
received a bronze star for carrying a
wounded soldier out of a minefield

Sunhill looks at Brenner He is staring at Fowler

FOWLER
Apparently you capitalized on your
weak knees Mr Brenner -- Airborne

School Ranger School Two decades
in the CID Commendations Awards
for valor A candidate for Master
Grade Five and then you fell off
the map

Fowler’s eyes veer to Sunhill

FOWLER

Agent Sunhill Masters degree in
Psychology Advanced training FBI
Academy Three years as an enlisted
criminal investigator specializing
in rape crimes Solid performance
rapid advancement Experience with
homocides -- limited

He pauses both agents watching him warily

FOWLER
Ive opened your files It’s crucial
we have the best qualified people on
this So Ill be blunt Is that who
you are

BRENNER
Sir do you want great reviews or do
you want results
———- -

A savage wrath

FOWLER
My requirements are straightforward
Mr Brenner -- Someone has violated

the very core of this division and
I want him found

ices his eyes Brenner meets them
BRENNER

Were going to have an arrest before
the General leaves command Colonel

Brenner glances at Sunhill

FOWLER
Elaborate

SUNHILL
Sir how well did you know Captain
Campbell

FOWLER

Well enough to deliver a eulogy when
her family buries her

SUNHILL
Did she have a good relationship with
her father Colonel

Fowler considers his words

FOWLER
General Campbell is an extraordinary
soldier Ms Sunhill His daughter
was strung with the same steel She
was in awe of him driven to live up
to his example

SUNHILL
The fact of the matter is Colonel
she was out of control

Fowler stares at her unblinkingly

FOWLER
Yes She was endangering her career
as an officer

SUNHILL
And the General’s
FOWLER
And the General’s

Everyone is silent

BRENNER
You have the floor sir

FOWLER
Captain Campbell was headstrong and
willful Her conduct off-duty had
become intolerable I conducted a
surveillance of her activities at
the General’s request It confirmed
the worst She was consorting with
many men

BRENNER
Were you aware they included Provost
Marshal Major Kent

The Chief of Staff regards him gravely

Brenner nods

FOWLER
Major Kent’s discharge is pending

BRENNER
I’d like to request those files sir

FOWLER
Major Kent has served this division
with extreme loyalty I don’t
believe he committed this crime and
I would be reluctant to release them

BRENNER
If that were the case sir I’d have
to subpeona them

FOWLER
You may well Mr Brenner I think
your perpetrator is outside the
military 1I’11 stand by my men until
the evidence tells me otherwise

he admires the attitude Fowler smiles warmth
cutting through his harsh exterior

FOWLER
This case seems to be in competent
hands Whatever else you need
let me know I’11 do what I can

BRENNER
Thank you sir

Fowler rises The agents rise

FOWLER
We’ll see the General now No need
to salute quick condolences Keep
it short

Major General Joe Campbell walks forward wearing battle-dress
and a chest-full of medals His face is craggy his hand huge
as he extends it out

BRENNER
Our deepest condolences sir

GENERAL CAMPBELL
Thank you Please be seated

Voice melancholy eyes glazed with grief He nods to Fowler
who leaves silently They all take chairs

GENERAL CAMPBELL
Colonel Fowler and I have served in
the Army together for forty-three
years We were boys in Korea men
in Viet Nam elders in the Gulf I
suppose as war becomes an antiquated
notion so do we

His smile is pained Brenner and Sunhill smile back politely
Campbell looks like a fierce Scottish clan chief a broadsword
wielder His smile leaves him

CAMPBELL
What’s the objective of this meeting
BRENNER

Sir to collect information that will

lead to a swift arrest

CAMPBELL

Then you have my full cooperation

He gazes on Sunhill It is evident that he sees in her youth

and attractiveness his own daughter

SUNHILL

Sir did you see your daughter often

CAMPBELL
Not infrequently We were to

have

breakfast the morning after she
was She never showed of course

He stares hollowly into her absence

SUNHILL

What was the nature of that meeting

sir
The General reflects sadly rueful

CAMPBELL
Frankly my daughter required

a bit

of a dressing down She was given
to obstinate behavior on occasion
I’d given her an ultimatum Change
her ways or incur paternal hellfire

He smiles at her brokenly

CAMPBELL

Perhaps you’ve experienced that sort

of episode yourself
The question triggers a tight reaction

SUNHILL

Yes sir My father was a command

sergeant and a disciplinarian
the highest order

Brenner sees animosity flicker in her eyes
away from her

CAMPBELL
Well She’s gone to us now

of

The General gazes

He sits without moving or speaking Staring A long silence
passes On the desk behind him a decanter of liquor nearly
empty a half-filled glass

BRENNER
I have to ask this sir where were
you on the night of her death

Campbell stirs himself
CAMPBELL
At my office at HQ I was working
late with Colonel Fowler

BRENNER
What time did you leave sir

CAMPBELL
At about twenty-three-hundred hours

BRENNER
General did you have have any
contact whatever with your daughter
on that night
Campbell’s eyes turn clouded desconsolate

CAMPBELL
No

The General slowly rises They rise This session is over
BRENNER
Sir is there anything we can do for
you
He looks down on Brenner darkly his voice very low
GENERAL CAMPBELL
Find the son of a bitch who killed
her

EXT GENERAL CAMPBELL’S RESIDENCE - EVENING

Lieutenant Elby closes the door behind the agents They step
off the porch move toward Brenner’s truck

SUNHILL
Maybe he’s the son of a bitch
BRENNER
Whats wrong with you You saw the
way she was killed The General is
clearly shattered by this

SUNHILL
He’s still accepting his appointment
to the Council He hasn’t said he’s
out of the next Presidential race

BRENNER
This father-daughter thing’s really
hitting a nerve isn’t it

His words elicit a withering look

Brenner stares

SUNHILL
It’s obvious Captain Campbell was
repressed by this man her whole
life He pushed her down and she
was going all out against it
That’s the reason she was killed

at her They stop at the truck

BRENNER
Don‘t let your personal biases get
in the way Sunhill You’ll start
forcing the pieces to make ‘em fit

SUNHILL
My personal biases This is a men’s
club I’m the woman Brenner Its
called objectivity

BRENNER
Better come up with more than that

She looks at him meaningfully

SUNHILL
I will

swift solid series of combinations into the canvas her gym

clothes sweated through She huffs out her blows aggressive

her teeth clenched in anger

Brenner in a nicely tailored gray suit stands in the doorway
beyond watching her

BRENNER
Anybody I know

Sunhill turns breathing hard

SUNHILL
Chances are good

She strips off her gloves She looks like she hasn’t slept

SUNHILL
I went through her files last night
All of them Exemplary history
Until you go back to the beginning

She picks up a towel Brenner watching her

SUNHILL
West Point Evaluation on admission
was good But third year evaluation
plunged Apparently she fell apart

BRENNER
Fell apart

SUNHILL
Grades attitude She had a series
of consultations with an Army
doctor named Zaccardo The records
are missing but his conclusion’s on
the evaluation -- stress syndrome

BRENNER
And you don’t buy it

SUNHILL
I think there’s something else here
This woman was acting out her anger
rage Maybe there was an incident
some kind of traumatic event It’s
worth tracking down

Brenner considers it Her eyes are on him intense full of
conviction

SUNHILL
I understand her Brenner I know
who she was

Seiver’s forensic operation is installed within the cavernous
space arched girders soaring high overhead the commotion of
his staff echoing

Sunhill and Brenner move past Captain Campbell’s humvee walls
of bulletin boards photos maps diagrams computers phones
vast tables of bagged and tagged evidence

They enter the lab section Seiver stands before three coffee
urns irritably trying to get half a cup filled

SEIVER
You want me to go without sleep get
me some fuckin’ caffeine

BRENNER
Get me some results Ill buy you an
expresso machine

SEIVER
Start shopping Item one Captain
Campbell’s clothes and dogtags were
recovered at Range Six They were
found in a plastic trash bag on the
roof of a latrine

They walk to another section of the lab Corkboard partitions
display a detailed diagram of the range bristling with multi-
colored pinheads designating prints A table holds dozens of
humbered plaster castings of impressions

SEIVER
Item Two Lots of tracks We matched
up the ones we thought were pertinent
and fed everything into the computer

Seiver stands at a computer monitor hammers some keys brings
up a graphic image Footprints They step across the screen
in a described pattern as if an invisible being were leaving
tread marks in its wake

SEIVER (CONTD)
That gave us the print sequence for
individual tracks We analyzed the
ones closest to the body

The screen brings up a three-dimensional image two bootprints
created with netted contour lines one overlaying the other

SEIVER
This is Sergeant St John’s boot and
the print it overlays is Major Kent’s
boot Indicating Kent arrived on the
scene before St John’s discovery

BRENNER
Is that positive

SEIVER
Im surmising We have two military
bootprints of the same make and same
tread depth made within hours of
each other If you want positive
I’1l send the photos and casts to an
expert

BRENNER
I want positive Get it on a plane

SEIVER
Right I have two sets of bootprints
here that havent been IDd yet

Brenner canvasses the area He sees a junior agent struggling
with a stack of reports He whistles shrilly waves him over

Hellmann sits next to Lt Rogers who looks up from her laptop

precision I can’t risk your track

Brenner’s expression hardens

hard ripping the line from the wall throws the phone across

the hot asphalt

BRENNER
You’re a real ballbuster Sunhill

SUNHILL
That’s right Brenner I’m not

stooges who think they can sweep
this under the rug

Brenner finds his keys rips open the door of the truck She
stops behind hin

SUNHILL
We said we were going all the way

sidelines make a fucking end-run

He stops where he is turns eyes savage

colored Abrams tanks howitzers Bradley fighting vehicles
massive engines of war mothballed in the military drawdown

gate They salute Fowler stops before them torso and arms
filling out his shirt eyes razor-edged

BRENNER
We have our man sir

FOWLER
Name him

Fowler assimilates the information grimly Beyond a private
dutifully scrubbing out the chamber of a tank

FOWLER
You say this understanding what my
position is

BRENNER
Yes sir You need to reconsider
your position

FOWLER
Why are we having this discussion
Mr Brenner

could do let you know There is

Keep me on this case

Fowler considers him wordlessly

INT PROVOST MARSHAL’S BUILDING - NIGHT

Brenner and Sunhill enter the doorway of the Provost Marshal’s
office a pair of MPs in tow Cabinets a wall of plaques and
awards his desk the chair behind it empty

SUNHILL

He didn’t bolt

Major Kent’s on the line sir

Brenner nods to Sunhill holding the phone Kent comes on

KENT (VO)
I hear you’re ready to close down
Brenner

BRENNER
Where are you Major

KENT (VO)

At the old infantry training field
I‘m just kind of walking around out
here I want to talk soldier-to-
soldier Brenner I’d really like
that courtesy

The line clicks off

EXT INFANTRY TRAINING FIELD - NIGHT

Summer thunder rolls distantly Brenner’s pick-up pulls up at
the edge of the field The headlights remain on Brenner and
Sunhill get out either door looking across the grass

The throw of the lights graze a tall figure in a white helmet
standing out in the middle of the field

BRENNER
Don’t wanna spook him Hang back

Brenner stares out at Kent uneasily
BRENNER
Unless he tries to kill me Then
don’t hang back

Brenner begins walking out

EXT FIELD FURTHER - NIGHT

Kent watches Brenner approach his face even stance relaxed
He puts a hand out motioning for him to halt

KENT
That’s far enough

Brenner stops about forty yards from him

KENT
You armed
BRENNER
I am
KENT
With what
BRENNER

With my weapon Major

KENT
Let me see it

Brenner sighs He snaps open his jacket exposing the butt of
a semi auto in a shoulder holster

KENT
Sig-Sauer Mll

Brenner studies him Kent’s own sidearm is still buttoned in
his holster

KENT
I stand by my Beretta M-9 It’s the
most accurate piece I’ve shot It’s
ergonomic friendly double-action
SA let-off is smooth the sights are
nicely proportioned regulation is
dead on

Kent eyes are on him glassy distant
KENT

It’ll absorb the recoil of a hot
NATO-spec load with total poise

Brenner sweats watching him The man is over the edge

thrum of crickets fills the humid night

BRENNER
That’s really great Major Not
many weapons can do that

He steps closer

KENT
Just stand there please I have
a few more things to say

His face is hollow and pale

KENT
I’ve been privileged to serve ina
great cause The Army has given
my life purpose I’ve loved it
fought for it bled Now I’ve
dishonored it I’m resigning my
commission Brenner

Brenner feels a ragged surge of pity

BRENNER
You’re doing the right thing Major

KENT
Don’t patronize me You don’t meet
the standards

Kent’s eyes glare white in the headlights
BRENNER

Easy Major Easy Just tell me
what happened that night

The

KENT
You tell me

BRENNER
You met her on the range It was
her idea of a thrill You’d done
it before But this time you lost
it It’s understandable Major
She was dumping you The tent cord
ended up in your hands By the
time you realized it was around her
neck

Kent shakes his head his face broken out with beads of sweat

KENT
Negative

BRENNER
Come in with me Major Just unhook
the sidearm Well make this easy

Kent grins eyes ignited Brenner wearily frees his pistol
starting toward him

BRENNER
Were not going hand-to-hand Major

KENT
Before you walk any further you
should know where you’re standing

BRENNER
Where am I standing

KENT
In a minefield

Brenner frowns Kent cracks his knuckles face anticipatory
KENT
I buried some Bouncing Bettys Anti-
personnel You buy that

BRENNER
Come on Major

KENT
Then you think I’m bluffing

Brenner sees elation fill Kent’s eyes He involuntarily scans
the dark grass around him It is unmowed and thick enough for
concealing dug earth

KENT
Remember how the Betty works First
man trips the primary Mine shoots
up Rest of the column walk into
the blast Their heads are removed
Or limbs Whatever

Brenner starts to move for Kent Then he sees just past the
reach of his headlights the upright shaft of what could be a
shovel jammed in the earth

KENT
Come and get me Brenner I11 wait
right here

Brenner stares at Kent trying to read him There’s a chance
the Provost Marshal is crazy enough to have planted something
dangerous in the grass

AT THE PICK-UP

Sunhill is watching adrenalin charged unsure of what Kent is
saying She has her gun in her hands

IN THE FIELD
Brenner stands motionless glances back to her then at Kent

KENT
You could turn around Walk out
the way you came in But if I am
bluffing you’re gonna look like
a coward in front of your partner

He stands easily savoring Brenner’s indecision the fear that
is beginning to take root

Brenner begins walking toward him his shoes crushing into the
grass He moves with purpose not looking down Kent watches
his every step with hollow glee

BRENNER
There’s no mines Major Youd be
in the kill radius too

KENT
I want to be in the kill radius

Brenner’s gait slows He stares ahead the headlights at his
back Sweat rolls down his face Crickets hum

KENT
Amazing what a load of shrapnel will
do to flesh and bone Take it clean
off -- well not clean at all
actually Youve seen the casualties

Brenner wills himself ahead nerves drawn tight looking down
watching for signs of disruption in the grass Kent is framed
against the night bathed in sickly light growing closer his
smile goading Brenner

Brenners shoe hits something He freezes Fear pumps sharp
and instantly His eyes bore into the grass his foot raised
half off the hidden obstruction

His chest constricts his breath audible swift He remains
still blinking sweat out of his eyes

Kents eyes are riveted to the grass where his shoe is poised
And suddenly the fear leaves He sees Kent for what he is a
sad loser playing a loser’s bluff

Kent sees the realization pass in Brenner’s eyes His goading
smile disappears stripped from him

BRENNER
It’s over

Brenner moves for him As the weight of his foot comes down
he feels it just under the rise of ground the steel of it

recognizes it and is diving in a running leap even as it is

triggered the primary charge cracking

The mine leaps up from the grass in a spray of sod Brenner
sprinting skidding belly down in a headlong dive the night
lighting up the air rocking in a massive concussion shards
of shrapnel whizzing

AT THE TRUCK

Sunhill shouts her voice drowned her face lit incandescent

IN THE FIELD

Smoke rolls wet clay rains down Brenner scrambles up to his
feet eyes wild

Through the drifting smoke Major Kent still standing BDU’s
shredded chest arms legs face perforated blooming blood

BRENNER
DON’T MOVE MAJOR

Kent’s eyes are blank He grins a ghastly grin and takes one

BURNS

It’s a grim outcome Mr Brenner
BRENNER

Yes sir
BURNS

Grim Deplorable Bad for business

Brenner holds silence anticipating being drawn and quartered
on the linoleum

BURNS
Apparently your work impressed the
Commander of the Post General
Campbell extended himself to keep
you on -- he called his personal
friend the Chief of Staff of the
Army My boss

He lances Brenner with his gaze

BURNS
In effect Colonel Hellmann was left
holding his dick on the airfield

Brenner catches Hellmann’s stare sorry he did The Colonel
is shooting death rays

BURNS
Did you have anything to do with
this Youre on your oath

Four sets of eyes bear down on him Brenner point-blank lies

BRENNER
No sir

BURNS
If I discover otherwise youll be
out of the Army so quick you’ll
think you were shot from a cannon

Hellmann stares at Brenner unhappily

BRENNER
Yes sir Sir has the objective of
this mission been met

Burns considers him shrewdly

BURNS
It has Damage sustainable I want
to make this clear Mr Brenner --
you‘re walking a very thin line I
advise you to keep a low profile

BRENNER
What did you get Seiver

SEIVER
He examined the tracks Says there’s
no method of determining with hundred
percent accuracy which came first

BRENNER
But he gave you his opinion

Seiver observes Brenner defensively

SEIVER
His opinion is Kent arrived on the
scene after St John not before

Brenner is stunned Seiver’s voice distending reverberating

I disagree with him Major Kent did
it The proof was collected ina

Johnny Ray offers advice to Brenner from his indolent slouch

JOHNNY RAY
That’s problematic for you

Deuce glides toward him Brenner shifts his stance Deuce’s
eyes flick over him contempuously

DEUCE
Hes tired

JOHNNY RAY
Give ‘ima rest

Deuce fearlessly plants himself across from Brenner unlimbers
his legs in a little bounce

DEUCE
Hey Johnny Ray You think he knows
hand-to-hand combat

JOHNNY RAY
Might You just got to stay hard as
white oak tree

Deuce’s eyes glaze psychotically

DEUCE
Man down in parking lot

He fires his leg at Brenner in vicious snap kick Brenner is
suddenly holding it tight in the crook of his arm He blurs
sweeping his own leg behind Deuce’s free leg and cracking the
point of his chin with a hard palm thrust reaping the man’s
standing leg out from under him Déuce slams the ground back-
first his cranial nerves short-circuited

Brenner releases his leg whips his pistol out levels it on
Johnny Ray who rolls off the car defensively his hand at the
rear of his waistband

in his work at a computer

The lights suddenly go out plunging the windowless room into
darkness The screaming primates fall silent Moore framed
in the dimness turns from his work He looks past the cages
toward the room’s entrance

Someone is standing there A vague shape Moore blinks his
lenses steamed in the close air

Moore lurches from the bench trying to feel his way forward

MOORE

A rhesus screams hurtling from its enclosure A projectile
of hair and muscle that rips past Moore’s face dislodging
his glasses The shape tears across the lab bench toppling
his monitor and vanishing

Moore gasps his glasses dangling He freezes eyes blindly
searching the dark A savage shriek pierces his ear Moore
screams a set of fangs rush out of the dark and snap at him

He stumbles along the bench flailing trips goes down to his
knees He brings his head up A set of red eyes blink at him
from a cage inches away A low lethal chatter commences He
hears the cage latch click

He glances up at her sunken-eyed and aged hard

ZACCARDO
Ms Sunhill I‘m Doctor Zaccardo
Apparently you have some sort of
an emergency today

SUNHILL
Yes

ZACCARDO
Remove your shoes please

Sunhill kicks off her flats The doctor leans down examines
her feet his spidery hands manipulating them

ZACCARDO
Actually you have exceedingly sound
conformation

SUNHILL
Actually it’s not my feet

The doctor’s eyes peer up at her from great dark circles His
complexion gray unhealthy

ZACCARDO
Explain please

SUNHILL
I’m here to talk about West Point

Zaccardo straightens up He stares down at her

SUNHILL
Nineteen-Eighty-Six Doctor You
examined a young cadet Her name
was Ann Campbell

Zaccardo’s face closes on her

ZACCARDO
I have no memory of her I examined
hundreds of cadets when I was at West
Point As you can see there’s been
quite an interval since then

SUNHILL
Captain Campbell was murdered at Fort
Hadley Georgia five days ago
Zaccardo moves to the door

ZACCARDO
I have a busy schedule

SUNHILL
I need your help Doctor

ZACCARDO
Who are you
Sunhill stares at him desperation rising She’s losing him

ZACCARDO
You’re an investigator Fine I’ll
call my attorney

He begins through the door

SUNHILL
I hope he handles malpractice

Zaccardo stops in his tracks Sunhill blinks stunned by what
she’s just said And it keeps coming

SUNHILL
I’m here for the plaintiff Doctor
Who asserts Captain Campbell’s death
was a direct result of the trauma she
underwent at West Point

He turns back to her fear flickering in his eyes

SUNHILL
And unless you can convince me you
were under orders to destroy her
medical files we’re slapping you
with a multi-million dollar lawsuit

The doctor stands uncertainly staring at her Sunhill opens
her purse removes a folded report She unfolds it reading

SUNHILL
Campbell Ann Grace Cause of death
-- asphyxia Aside from ligature on
neck no trauma to exposed tissue or
to bones brains mouth vagina

She pauses her emotions rising

SUNHILL
Some erosion of the cervix indicating
a prior disease abortion Stomach
bladder intestine contents analyzed
toxicology clean No drugs poisons
alcohol Trace fluids analyzed
Perspiration Tears

She looks up at him

SUNHILL
Tears running downward from the eyes

Zaccardo moves to the counter seems out of breath He leans
there not facing her

SUNHILL
This was a human being Doctor She
was crying when her life ended And
she was crying when she came to you
ten years ago

He remains immobilized against the counter
ZACCARDO
There’s nothing I can say that will
help her now

SUNHILL
You can tell the truth

Zaccardo slowly turns A man who has buried himself alive
ZACCARDO
It was so long ago I was sworn
to secrecy You have to understand
It wasn’t easy getting a position
He stares into the past

She fights it trying to keep her voice even

SUNHILL

There’s no record of the charges
ZACCARDO

She never filed charges
SUNHILL

Why

Zaccardo looks on her

ZACCARDO

Charges would have lead to a court
martial and a court martial would
have dishonored the institution
So far as the United States Army is
concerned it never occurred

SUNHILL
And the cadets who raped her

ZACCARDO
Never identified Men who’ve become
one thing or another blended
anonymously into military or civilian
life

SUNHILL
Was it Campbell’s decision not to
pursue a court martial

The doctor regards her bitterly

ZACCARDO

been waging a war against him ever

Her eyes fall to the chalk outline

BRENNER
You strangled her

Fowler is still watching him He speaks finally voice hard

FOWLER
Captain Campbell was a disgrace to
the uniform she wore Whoever the
executioner was he did the Army a
great service
BRENNER
Is that your confession

They stand silently in the dim dusty light A soft click is
heard From Brenner’s jacket pocket Fowler nods toward it

FOWLER
I think you ran out of tape

Brenner scowls his eyes falling to his pocket Fowler steps
toward the table where his briefcase rests Brenner puts his
hand near his weapon ready to draw it

BRENNER
That’s far enough

Fowler stands motionless Brings his full commanding gaze on
Brenner

FOWLER
Captain Campbell is dead and buried
Mr Brenner But you and I are part
of something that will never die
We continue The General continues
Were pieces of the same machine

His eyes bore into him

FOWLER

I’m putting a letter of commendation
in your file As you’ve seen I have
influential connections You can get
your Master Grade The respect and
prestige that come with it All you
have to do is just turn around and
walk out

Brenner watches him warily

BRENNER
A bribe Colonel
FOWLER
A reward For a job well done
BRENNER
No deal
FOWLER

Then you’ve chosen the alternative

He has a black pistol in one black-gloved hand An Army-issue
Beretta that freezes Brenners own hand at his lapel

FOWLER
Use that hand to remove the tape
recorder

Brenner slowly does so caught by Fowler’s stealth and speed

FOWLER
Toss it to me Underhand

Brenner underhands it Fowler catches it his weapon steady
He steps to his briefcase opens it drops the recorder in it

BRENNER
Now what

FOWLER
I shoot you With Lieutenant Elby’s
weapon Then I return it to where
he keeps it He’s been under a lot
of stress since you linked him up to
that basement sex ring

Brenner is coiled intent waiting for the slightest chance to
rip his piece out and fire it empty

BRENNER
It won’t fly Colonel

FOWLER
No one knows we’re here Mr Brenner
And Ive arranged an emergency for
Lieutenant Elby He’ll miss the
ceremonies entirely As for myself
I was in full view of four thousand
troops when he shot you

Brenner’s arm flashes his weapon halfway out as Fowler’s gun

cracks twice Brenner taking both shots in the chest kicks

backward lands on his back the rotten planks caving in under
him his body crashing through the floor

Dust billows Fowler moves over the hole in the boards His
sights rest on Brenner sprawled on his back in the filth of
the foundation three feet below Still as rock mouth gaping
eyes glazed two black holes blown into his jacket nearly on
center and close together
Fowler’s gun slams the muzzle blast lighting the dark of the
foundation Brenner’s body jolting as the middle of his shirt
explodes into white tatters the ejected shell tinkling across
the boards Fowler admires his marksmanship

FOWLER
One-inch group

He steps over the broken planking grabs his briefcase walks
swiftly out the barracks door

EXT PARADE FIELD - FORT HADLEY - DAY

General Campbell gazes out over the companies of his division
assembled in formation rows of bright flags shimmering in the
windless heat

CAMPBELL
I stand here an old infantryman with
a soldiers love for the Army It’s
grandeur It’s ability to make heros
of common men and women whose service
is given in faith and courage

His words ring over the field He wears battle dress a belt
with a holstered pistol a blouse filled with medals for wars
campaigns A line of senior officers stand behind him Fowler
among them his saber hilt glinting

CAMPBELL
We serve something much larger than
ourselves and to serve it we must
hold it dearer than our own flesh
and blood We are bound together
as only warriors can be bound I
have given my heart to my country
and my service to it will never end

The General turns The color sergeant formally offers him the
division flag The General receives it turning once more to
solemnly confer it upon the new Commander of the Post and the
chain of command continues unbroken

The General salutes him relinquishing his position and turns
his salute to his troops his face held rigidly against tears
There is a deep and awed silence The General steps down from
the platform in majesty and sorrow

A great cheer erupts from the companies standing in formation
Thousands of voices raised up in heartfelt farewell an uproar
that rocks across the still afternoon
EXT PARADE FIELD ROAD - DAY
Sunhill stands at her car above the field anxiously searching
for Brenner She holds a cellular phone the dialed number on
display the line audibly pulsing
SUNHILL

Come on Brenner
EXT BARRACKS 5 - DAY
Brenner’s truck on the hot asphalt the phone unit on the dash
pulsing light lit
INT BARRACKS 5 - DAY
The broken flooring In the dimness past it propped against
the wall and in considerable pain Brenner He is shirtless
streaked with dirt and sweat grimacing as he tears loose the
straps of a Kevlar bullet-proof vest
The vest slides off three black impact marks dented into the
heart region His chest is bruised ribs broken He hears a
phone pulsing faintly turns his head to the open barracks
door his truck visible past it
EXT PARADE FIELD ROAD - DAY

Sunhill frustrated stares at her phone the line unanswered

SUNHILL
Damn

She disconnects

EXT BRENNER’S TRUCK - BARRACKS 5 - DAY

Brenner leans out of the open door thumbing the phone on and
bringing it to his ear Dial tone
EXT PARADE FIELD ROAD - DAY

Sunhill moves away from her car stalled anxious looking for
some sign of Brenner Her beeper goes off she turns sprints
back to her car dives for the phone

SUNHILL

EXT BRENNER’S TRUCK - BARRACKS 5 - DAY

Brenner breathing in pain is sitting behind the wheel phone
in hand

BRENNER
Oh yeah

SUNHILL (VO)
Where the hell are you

BRENNER

(wincing)
Listen to me Find Fowler’s car
Look for his briefcase Moores
tape recorder should be in it

SUNHILL (V0O)

BRENNER
Then find the General That’s where
Fowler will be I’m on my way
He disconnects fires the engine slams into gear scorching
off across the asphalt

EXT ROAD - BELOW PARADE FIELD - DAY

The trunk of Fowler’s staff car The rend of metal the trunk
lid popping up In the well of the trunk Fowlers briefcase

A soldier with a slide-hammer moves back Sunhill stands over
the open trunk staring in
EXT AERIAL VIEW - PARADE FIELD - DAY

A vast green floor studded with columns of distant soldiers in
olive and tan Tiny colorful flags Brass glinting from the
military band the remote sound of horns and drums The field
lined with grandstands filled with civilians

EXT AERIAL VIEW - CLOSER

The parade march coming in louder The Generals personal car
on the lawn below A group of ranking officers gathered there
bidding the General and his wife goodbye Recognizable within
the gathering Colonel Fowler shaking hands

From the tan width of road below the officers a figure moving
across the grass toward them Sunhill her stride determined
The parade drums thundering beating out a martial cadence

EXT AERIAL VIEW - CLOSER

Sunhill approaches the group stopping a dozen feet away One
by one the officers turn to her Stillness falling over them
as the General walks out to meet her

They exchange words The General turns to where Fowler stood
but Fowler is no longer there He turns back to Sunhill The
drums reverberate She raises the tape recorder The General
stands listening to the playback

Sunhill turns the recorder off The General staggered walks
away from her He drops to his knees

The rumbling percussion fades out as a great anguished scream
rises up shaking the air

EXT BRENNER’S TRUCK - EDGE OF PARADE FIELD - DAY

The pick-up slams to a skidding halt Brenner bails out still
shirtless weapon in hand He races past the crowd that pours
out on the field soldiers and civilians staring shouting out
in alarm

EXT PARADE FIELD - DAY

The General is bowed on the turf his wife has rushed to him
Sunhill stricken turns from him as the shouting rises past
her Brenner is sprinting up through the midst of the crowd
his badge held high She runs toward him

SUNHILL
Fowler’s gone

Brenner and Sunhill desperately scan the field swarming now
with soldiers many armed and ready to shoot A group of MPs
pound toward them pistols out Brenner raises his badge up
bellowing hoarsely

BRENNER
CID FIND COLONEL FOWLER

Another wave of shouts and cries fills the air Brenner and
Sunhill pivot see a flurry of commotion a crowd rushing to
an area ahead of them

They take off at a dead run both quickly closing ground for
the fringes of the throng soldiers and civilians pushing in
toward something

They reach the edge of a human wall jump in tearing a path

BRENNER
CID STAND AWAY STAND BACK

They fight their way through the close pack of bodies Brenner
ramming forward yelling raggedly The crowd gives they push
out into an open circle of lawn bringing themselves up short
panting staring ahead

Colonel Fowler stands in a clearing ringed by shocked soldiers
and civilians saber drawn an MP arm slashed lying pale and
still on the grass below him his pistol under Fowler’s shoe

BRENNER
Give it up Colonel

Fowler face stone eyes black stares at him past reason or
redemption Several soldiers make a move toward him he cuts
the air with his steel growling they leap back as the crowd
shouts out

He glares savagely at Brenner swinging his blade in a circle
the sun gleaming off the razor-honed edge of it He advances
Brenner and Sunhill drop down defensively level their weapons
as the ring of onlookers fall back

BRENNER
Halt

Fowler raises the blade over his head The blast of a gunshot
splits the air a row of medals exploding off his chest The
Colonel lurches topples face forward dead as he hits ground
The agents frozen in a crouch stare in astonishment weapons
unfired The crowd stunned silent parting across the circle
of the clearing leaving one man standing alone

General Campbell His officer’s Beretta in his hand features
terrible eyes hollow

He lowers his gun It slips from his fingers Pandemonium

EXT MAIN BOULEVARD - FORT HADLEY - DAY

Hot Georgia sky Shadeless lawn Chanting A file of young
head-shaven recruits moving in step-time along the road their
drill sergeant dogging them

Sunhill‘s Mustang one flank scraped and battered drives past
them moving toward the main gate

EXT MAIN GATE - FORT HADLEY - DAY

She stands outside her car shading her eyes Brenners pick-

up approaches The truck stops he gets out crosses the road
to her

They stand facing each other glad to see each other sorry it
may be the last time

BRENNER
So you‘re really out

SUNHILL
It had to be that way

Brenner nods understanding She gazes at him regretfully

SUNHILL
What happens to you

BRENNER
I’m not sure They can’t decide
whether to give me a medal or hang
me Maybe I’1ll just cash out

SUNHILL
You’re a lifer Brenner

BRENNER
Yeah I guess I am

They smile their attraction to each other seen in their eyes

SUNHILL
Am I ever gonna see you again

BRENNER
Just let me know where you are

Their smiles fade They stand close to each other wanting to
embrace Instead he extends his hand in respect Her eyes
hold her own regard sincerity

SUNHILL
Thank you For everything

Their handshake lingers Sunhill turns her eyes damp enters
her car He leans over her window She looks up at him

SUNHILL
I turned a corner in my life My
father The General Fowler The
Army what it stands for they all
got it wrong

Brenner stares at her somber

SUNHILL
Who really killed her Brenner

BRENNER
Everybody

Their gaze lasts a moment more She smiles a plaintive smile
a look of goodbye Then she starts the car turning her eyes
to the future

Brenner remains there watching her pull out her car drawing
away on the road receding

FADE OUT
