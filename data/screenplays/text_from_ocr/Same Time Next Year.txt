INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 12
George is seated alone and is the only one in the room A
few people are having cocktails in the bar beyond A fire-

cocktail As he glances at his watch something catches his
eye

look

ANGLE —- DORIS - NIGHT 12-E

turns and pours her coffee She catches George watching her
and turns away

smile The waiter returns to her table ready to take her
order She indicates all she wants is coffee and hands him
the menu As the waiter moves away George on an impulse
calls him over whispers something in his ear The waiter
looks surprised glances over his shoulder at Doris looks
back at George George nods and then afraid he will change
his mind quickly buries himself in his magazine

on it in the form of a toast Doris starts to giggle

ANOTHER ANGLE - MONTAGE SHOT 14

rather formal overly polite They listen to one another
too attentively in the manner of strangers The restaurant

sive unselfconscious gesture The restaurant has started
to empty and there are only a few diners left The candle
on the table is half-burned down

The camera stays with him as he moves away from the bed and
stops as he takes the clothes strewn all over the room They

of my children and the look of be-
trayal in their eyes I keep think-
ing of our marriage vows the trust

nothing to be ashamed or afraia of

There is a knock at the door Both freeze their eyes reflect-
ing total panic

GEORGE

Just a second

They go into frantic action as they both dive for the clothes
on the floor bumping into each other in the process He
rolls sheet up stuffs it under the bed as she grabs her hat
jacket and purse and starts for the bathroom

(panic-stricken
in a desperate
hiss)

foal

Fairly large furnished with two garden chairs a small table
a couple of chaise lounges and decorated with flower pots
Although it has a marvelous view of the grounds and coastline
it also has a secluded feeling due to the trellis overhang
and shrubbery

As George peers down over the edge of the deck the angle lets
us see Doris come through the front door of the cottage move
through the room and out onto the deck behind George

DORIS
(in a deep
voice)
You have a woman in here

Startled he turns to face her When he has recovered he puts
tray down

perfect strangers can look at
each other across a crowded
room and suddenly want to poss-
ess each other in every conceivable
way possible

She thinks for a second

DORIS
No

GEORGE

Than how did this whole thing
start

ant

They didnt serve drinks Theyre
known for their steaks

stories -- one showing the best
side of my wife and the other
showing the worst Then you do
the same about your husband and
then lets forget that Okay

another woman it goes off like
a fire alarm Last night at

upright in bed with her head
going ding ding ding ding

A day in February 1956

Angle on a homemade sign reading Happy Pifth Anniversary
Darling

As the angle widens we see that George wearing a charcoal
suit and pink shirt of the period is pinning up the sign on
the inside of the front door He has put on a few pounds
his hair has just started to thin and at thirty-two he gives
the impression of more substance It is just an impression
Although his manner is more subdued than five years ago and
his insecurities flash through less frequently it is only
because he has learned a degree of his mercurial moods He
moves to check some champagne that has been set up on the
piano and then to the coffee table where he proceeds to
light five candles set in a small iced cake

GEORGE
Be sure and let me know when
youre coming out

DORIS (0s)
Right now

GEORGE
Wait a minute

He quickly moves to the piano sits

00355 35

GEORGE
Okay -- now

As Doris enters he sings and plays If I Knew You Were
Coming Id Have Baked A Cake She is dressed in a strap-
less black cocktail dress that was considered chic in the
suburbs in the fifties is slimmer than before and more
carefully put together The most striking physical change

in her is her very blonde hair shaped in a Gina Lollobrigida
cut She has acquired some of the social graces of middle
class suburbia is more articulate than before and has
developed a wry deprecating wit that doesnt hide a certain
tenseness of manner She does a little jitterbug step to the
music he stops playing embraces her

GEORGE
Happy anniversary darling

He indicates the cake

GEORGE
Cut the cake and make a wish

He moves to pour two glasses of champagne as she sits on the
sofa blows out the candles cuts cake He moves to sofa
hands her champagne sits beside her

GEORGE
What did you wish

DORIS
I have only one wish

GEORGE
What

DORIS
That you keep showing up every
year

They kiss tenderly She serves cake through following

GEORGE
That was one of the best ideas
you ever had

DORIS

year I dont think either of
us can take credit for that

DORIS (Contd)
It was just something we stumbled
into five years ago Matter of
fact that first year I didnt
think youd show up at all

GEORGE
I was sure you wouldnt of
course in those days I had less
confidence in my personal
magnetism

He moves to get champagne bottle

DORIS
Whered you get the champagne

GEORGE
(refilling her
glass)
Old Chalmers brought it while
you were changing

DORIS
Bit risky isnt it

GEORGE
Oh Im sure by now old Chalmers
knows the score

DORIS
I really think he does Every
time I go past the front desk
he winks at me

GEORGE
Thats not a wink He has a
tic in his eye

DORIS
Chalmers has a tic
(he nods)
Why didnt you tell me that For
five years Ive been winking back

He laughs gazes at her affectionately

kisses

GEORGE

Without changing his position he reaches out and takes the
phone

GEORGE

Hello
(his expression
changes)
Yes this is Daddy Is there
anything wrong

He rolls off Doris and assumes a tense position on the edge
of the bed

GEORGE
(into phone)
Funny Well thats probably
because Daddy was just -- uh --
I had a frog in my throat sweetheart

He is now sitting with the phone in his hand bent over
almost as if he has a stomach ache Doris moves off the
bed unobtrusively straightens her clothes and hair as she
drifts toward French doors

with passion

Sometimes
GEORGE
Youve never said anything

I just deal with it in a different
way
GEORGE

DORIS
Privately

Still agitated he starts pacing the room again

GEORGE
I dont know -- maybe men are
more sensitive than women

up on the piano George is still very much concerned with

brings you up short
(holds out
trembling hands)
I mean look at me I tell you
Doris - when she started talking

about the tooth fairy -- well it
affected me in a very profound
manner

(a beat)

On top of that I have indigestion
you cant believe It hit me
that hard you know

DORIS
George I have three children too

GEORGE
What do you want me to do Doris

DORIS
I think it might be a terrific
idea if you stopped talking
about it Its only making you
feel worse

GEORGE
I cant feel worse That pure
little voice saying ---

He sees her expression stops tries to shake it off with
a jerk of his head

GEORGE
No youre right Forget it
Talk about something else Tell
me the good story about Harry

During the following George tries to concentrate but is
obviously distracted and nervous

DORIS
Okay He went bankrupt

This momentarily jolts him out of his problem

GEORGE
How can anyone go bankrupt
selling TV sets

DORIS

Harry has this one weakness as a
salesman Its a compulsion to
talk people out of things they
cant afford He lacks the killer
instinct

(reflectively)
Its one of the things I like best
about him Anyway he went into
real estate Your turn

GEORGE

What
DORIS

Tell me your story about Helen
GEORGE

I already did
DORIS

You just told me the bad one
Why do you always tell that one

knee badly on a lawn sprinkler

He moves to pour liquor speaks over-casually

GEORGE
Oh listen something just
occurred to me Instead of my
leaving at my usual time would
you mind if I left a little

earlier
DORIS
(puzzled)
When did you have in mind
GEORGE
Well theres a plane in half an
hour
DORIS
(astounded)

You want to leave twenty-three
hours early

He moves to get suitcase puts it on bed and proceeds to
pack during following as she watches with unbelieving eyes

GEORGE
Theres a connecting flight in San
Francisco in ninety minutes

He glances up sees her expression

GEORGE
Look I know how you feel -- I

swallowed the tooth It could
be lodged God knows where

Uh -- have you seen my hairbrush
Anyway Im probably doing you a
favor If I did stay I wouldnt
be very good company and ---

Without a word Doris throws the hairbrush at him It sails

past his head and crashes against the wall He turns to
look at her There is a pause

GEORGE
You feel somewhat rejected right
Well I can understand that but I
want you to know my leaving has
nothing to do with you and me

She just stares at him

GEORGE
Doris this is an emergency I
have a sick child at home

DORIS

(exploding)
Oh will you stop Its got
nothing to do with the goddamn
tooth fairy Youre consumed
with guilt and the only way you
can deal with it is by getting
as far away from me as possible

GEORGE
Okay I feel guilty Is that so
strange Doris were cheating
Once a year we lie to our families
and sneak off to a hotel in
California and commit adultery
(he holds up
his hands)
Not that I want to stop doing it
But yes I feel guilt I admit
it
DORIS
(incredulous)
You admit it You take out ads

DORIS (Contd)
You probably stop strangers in the
street Youve probably got a
scarlet ‘A embroidered on your
jockey shorts You wander around
like an open nerve saying ‘Im
cheating but look how guilty I
feel so I must really be a nice
guy And to top it all you have
the incredible arrogance to think
youre the only one in the world
with a conscience Well that
doesnt make you a nice guy You
know what that makes you A
horses ass

There is a pause

GEORGE
(finally)
You know something I liked you
better before you joined the Book
of the Month Club

DORIS
Thats not why youre leaving
George

GEORGE

Well maybe we can talk about that
in the car

She looks at him in some surprise

GEORGE
I really hate to ask you Doris
but I need a lift to the airport

Youre surprised I insisted on
visiting the dead rabbits grave
(looks at him
puzzled)
How come youre wearing your pajamas
and robe in the middle of the after-
noon

GEORGE
(somewhat
irritably)
Im rehearsing a Noel Coward play

He sits she looks at him

DORIS
George is there something on your
mind

GEORGE

Not any more

He attempts to hide his displeasure with an incredulous small

half-laugh
GEORGE
You must be eight months pregnant

DORIS
Exactly

DORIS (Contd)
(seeing his
expression)
Honey its not that tragic Well
just have to find some other way
to communicate

GEORGE
Great You have any ideas
DORIS
Well we could talk
GEORGE
Talk I can get at home
DORIS
Well sex I can get at home

(grins)
And as you can see that aint
just talk

GEORGE
Oh really And what is that sup-
posed to make me

at him curiously

DORIS
George what is the matter with
you

GEORGE
What was that crack about sex at
home Is that supposed to reflect
on me You dont think I have nor-
mal desires and sex drives

DORIS
Of course I do Youre very normal
I just meant I look forward to see-

ing you for a lot of reasons besides

sex Do you think we would have
lasted for ten years if thats all
we had in common

He looks at her relaxes somewhat

GEORGE
Of course not
(sincerely)
Im sorry Doris You drive all
the way up here in your condition
and then I behave like a ridiculous
idiot You should have thrown
something at me Im sorry

DORIS
Is something else bothering you

He moves to get a bottle of Cutty Sark scotch from his
case

GEORGE
No Its just that I was looking
forward to an -- intimate weekend

He moves to piano to pour drink through the following
holds up bottle she shakes head

DORIS
You think we can only be intimate
through sex

GEORGE

I think it sure helps
DORIS

Oh maybe at the beginning
GEORGE

The beginning
DORIS

Well every year we meet its a
bit strange and awkward at first
but we usually solve that with a
lot of heavy breathing in between
the sheets

GEORGE
Honey if were not going to do it
would you mind not talking about it

DORIS

I just meant maybe we need some-
thing else to break the ice

GEORGE
(pouring himself
another drink)
Im wide open to suggestions

DORIS
How about this Supposing I tell
you some secret about myself Ive
never told anyone before in my
life

GEORGE
I think Ive had enough surprises
for one day

He moves to fireplace

DORIS
Youll like this one Ive been
having these sex dreams about you

He turns to face her

She nods

GEORGE
When

DORIS
Just lately Almost every night

GEORGE
What sort of dreams

DORIS

Thats whats so strange Theyre
always the same Were making
love but always underwater In
caves grottosswimming pools --
but always underwater Isnt that
weird

(she shrugs)
Probably something to do with me
being pregnant

GEORGE
Underwater huh

DORIS

secret about yourself

of Doris and Geroge in water of duck pond

GEORGE
Hey Im really sorry about before
Im really glad to see you anyway

DORIS
You want to tell me what it was all
about

ANOTHER ANGLE

We see that Doris and George are leaning on the rail of a
wooden bridge that spans a duck pond George looks at Doris
for a moment

GEORGE

Okay I may as well get it out into
the open I mean its nothing to
be ashamed of

(a beat)
Its my - my sex life Lately
Helen hasnt been able to satisfy
me

DORIS
(surprised)
She lost her interest in sex

GEORGE
Oh she tries -- God knows But I
can tell shes just going through
the motions

DORIS
Do you have any idea why this is

GEORGE
Well Helens always had a lot of
hang-ups about sex She always
thought cf it as just a healthy
normal pleasant function Dont
you think thats a bit twisted

DORIS
Only if youre Catholic

and

GEORGE
(earnestly)

Youre joking but theres a lot
to be said for guilt and shame I
mean if you dont feel a certain
amount of guilt I think youre
missing half the fun To Helen --
sex has always been good clean --
entertainment No wonder sne grew
tired of it

He finds Doris gaze somewhat disconcerting

GEORGE
Anyway for some reason my sex
drive has increased while hers has
decreased

DORIS
Thats odd Usually its the other
way around

GEORGE
(defensively)
Are you accusing me of lying

DORIS

Of course not Why are you so edgy
GEORGE

Because -- well naturally I feel

funny talking about this when shes
not here to defend herself

Doris straightens up puts hand on her back
stretches to relieve a muscle cramp

DORIS

Boy Ill tell you something That
Ethel Kennedy must really like kids

ANOTHER ANGLE

as they slowly move up the path that leads towards the inn

DORIS
Would you like to get to the more
formal part of your presentation

awkwardly

et

00355 61

GEORGE
About Helen

She nods

GEORGE
Okay Ill start with the good
story about her

DORIS
Youve never done that before
You must be mellowing

GEORGE
Doris do you mind We went to
London We were checking into a
hotel and there was a man ina
formal coat and striped trousers
standing at the front entrance
Helen handed him her suitcase and
breezed on into the lobby The
man followed her and very politely
pointed out that not only didnt
he work at the hotel but that he
was the Danish ambassador

They stop at a large shade tree

GEORGE

Without batting an eye she said
‘Well thats marvelous Maybe
you can tell us the good places
to eat in Copenhagen

(with an

amazed look)
And he did The point is that it
doesnt bother her when she makes
a total ass of herself I really
admire that

Doris sits on a wooden bench that circles the trunk of the
three

DORIS
And what is it that you dont
admire

GEORGE
Its that damned sense of humor
of hers

DORIS
Oh good -- these are the stories I
like the best

George sits down on the grass near her feet He speaks
quietly

GEORGE

wed come home from a party and
wed had a few drinks and we went
to bed and we started to make love
Well nothing happened -- for me -
I couldnt -- well you get the
picture It was no big deal We
laughed about it

(a beat)
Then about half an hour later just
as I was about to fall asleep she
said Its funny when I married a
CPA I always thought it would
be his eyes that would go first’

She looks at him sympathetically He avoids her gaze gets
up moves a few feet away looks out towards the ocean his
back to her

DORIS
(finally)
She was just trying to make you
feel better George

GEORGE
Well it didnt Some things
arent funny

She doesnt say anything

GEORGE
I suppose what Im trying to say
is that the thing that bugs me the
most about Helen is that she broke
my pecker

He picks up a stone throws it angrily toward the ocean
DORIS
(gently)

Youre impotent

GEORGE
Slightly

GEORGE
Okay now five people know Me

DORIS

GEORGE
Chet Huntley
(angrily pacing)
Im sure her mother has given him
the bulletin for the six oclock
news
DORIS
(sympathetically)
When did it happen honey
He turns to look at her
j GEORGE
Happen Doris were not talking
ya about a thruway accident I mean
you dont wake up one morning and
say Oh shoot the old family
jewels have gone on the blink
Its a gradual thing
DORIS
Hows Helen reacting
GEORGE
Oh we havent discussed it much
but I get the feeling she regards
it as a lapse in ones social
responsibility You know rather
like letting your partner down in
tennis by not holding your serve
She dcesnt smile
GEORGE
Seriously Ill be okay The
patients not dead -- just resting
Doris extends her hand

ya GEORGE

Doris that statement hardly calls
for congratulations

He takes her hand pulls her to her feet She puts her arm
through his and they start to move towards the cottage

INT COTTAGE - INN - NIGHT

George a drink nearby is lying on the sofa a February
1961 issue of Time on his chest He is not reading the
magazine but is contemplating the ceiling a troubled look
in his eyes The radio is softly playing Doris comes out

of the bathroom moves to sofa looks down at him for a moment

DORIS
Is there anything I can say that
will help

GEORGE
You can say anything you want except
‘its all in your head I mean Im

no doctor but I have a great sense
of direction

(moves to turn

off radio)
Look to tell you the truth Im not
too crazy about the whole subject
Lets forget it huh

DORIS
Okay What do you want to talk about

He sits on arm of sofa

GEORGE
Anything but sex Howd you feel
about being pregnant

She moves around to fire thinks it out

DORIS
Catatonic incredulous angry
pragmatic and finally maternal
Pretty much in that order

GEORGE
Your vocabularys improving

DORIS

Ah you dont know Youre talking
to a high school graduate

00355

GEORGE
(surprised)
How come
DORIS

Well I was confined to bed for the
first three months of my pregnancy
so rather than it being a total loss
I took a correspondence course

GEORGE
(admiringly)
Youre really something you know
that

DORIS
Theres kind of an ironic twist to
all this

GEORGE
What

DORIS

Well I didnt graduate from high
school the first time because I
got pregnant And now I did grad-
uate from high school --

(grins taps

stomach)
-- because I yot pregnant
Appeals to my sense of order

GEORGE
(teasing)
I didnt know you had a sense of
order

DORIS
Thats unfair Im much better at
housework now Must be the nesting
instinct Anyway the day my diploma
came in the mail Harry bought me a
corsage and took me out dancing
Well we didnt really dance -- we
lumbered Afterwards we went to a
malt shop and had a hot fudge sandae

both hands pressed on either side of her back

GEORGE
Doris are you comfortable in that

He takes her by arm leads her to sofa

He takes her shoes off during the following

GEORGE
(vaguely)
Oh -- fine Michael got a job with

She notices that he is staring at her with an odd fixed
expression

seventh birthday My uncle gave

Excuse me

He marches to the piano sits and aggressively launches into
Chopins Revolutionary Etude No 12 Surprisingly he plays
extremely well Not quite concert hall material but close
enough to fool a lot of people Doris absolutely astounded
finally recovers enough to stand up and move to the piano
where she watches him with an incredulous expression

DORIS
Thats incredible Are you as good
as I think you are

He continues to play until indicated

GEORGE
How good do you think I am

DORIS
Sensational

GEORGE
Im not as good as you think I am

DORIS
(puzzled)
But that piano has been sitting
there for ten years and youve
hardly touched it Why today

GEORGE
It beats a cold shower

DORIS
You play to release sexual tension

GEORGE
You dont even get this good without
a lot of practice
She watches him as he vigorously pounds away

GEORGE
Then how ---

DORIS

Dont worry darling Well work

They are standing by the bed She kisses him tenderly
Gradually he becomes more involved in the kiss until they
are in a passionate embrace Suddenly she breaks doubles

GEORGE
Doris for Gods sake what is it

She looks at him unbelievingly not saying a word

GEORGE
Doris what the hell is the matter
DORIS
(finally)
If -- if memory serves me correctly

-- I just had a labor pain

She sinks onto bed He stands stock still trying to
absorb this but not really taking it too seriously yet

GEORGE
You -- you cant have Maybe its
indigestion

DORIS

No theres a difference Indigestion
doesnt make your eyes bug out

GEORGE
But you cant be in labor When is
the baby due

DORIS
Not for another month

Ne stares at her for a moment and then puts his hands to
his head

GEORGE
My God what have I done
DORIS
What have you done
GEORGE
I brought it on My - my selfish-
ness

GEORGE
Excited I thought I had troubles
with my sex life before Can you
imagine what this is going to do to
it

DORIS
George will you ---

She stops aS a new pain hits her Breathlessly

DORIS
I think Id better lie down

She lies back on bed her top half propped up by pillows
George is too self-involved to notice her discomfort

GEORGE
(anguished)
What kind of a man am 1 What kind
of man would do a thing like that

DORIS
May I say something

GEORGE
Look I appreciate what youre trying
to do but nothing you can say will
make me feel any better

DORIS
Im not trying to make you feel any
better Im going to have a baby

GEORGE
I know that

DORIS
I mean now I have a history of
short labor

He looks at her for a moment and then shakes his head in a
firmly negative gesture indicated no -- this is not going
to happen to him backs away to a far wall trying to ward
off the unthinkable

Oh -- no Oh no

A new labor cramp hits her and he watches her
as she tries to weather the pain

GEORGE
(anxiously)
How do you feel

DORIS

(desperately)

Maybe its a false alarm It has

on her face She has taken her skirt off and is now in her
top and slip

DORIS
Were not going to make it to the
hospital My water just broke

The blood drains from his face

GEORGE
Oh my God

He slowly doubles over and clutches his stomach -- almost as
if he is having labor pains She moves towards the bed
half sits half lies on it

DORIS
Were going to have to find a
doctor in the area

This snaps him out of his sympathetic pains

GEORGE
What if we cant

She turns to look at him

DORIS
You look awful Youre not going
to faint are you

GEORGE
(in total shock)
Doris Im not a cab driver I
dont know how to deliver babies

In an automatic reflex action he puts the receiver against
his chest as if someone will overhear Then as her knees
come up under the bedcovers he waves his hands to get her to
put them dowr again panic-stricken that this will bring on
the birth She complies
GEORGE
Hold on Doris Youre going to be
okay Everything --

He stands up very agitated
GEORGE

He holds the receiver with both hands in vertical position
in front of his face and yells slowly and distinctly into
the phone
GEORGE
Well get in your car and drive

him Just -- get -- him
He hangs up and moves unsteadily to sit on a hassock near
the bed holds his stomach bends over and resumes his labor
pains
GEORGE
Its okay -- hes on his boat -- (X)

but its just down the road
Chalmers is getting him

Doris suddenly sits up a look of total panic in her eyes

On the other side of the room he ineffectually waves both
hands in a gesture to get her to lie back

GEORGE
Lean back and -- relax

He stares at her absorbs the situation and we see a
definite transformation takes place as he realizes he is
going to have to rise to the occasion He starts to roll up
his sleeves

out of his pocket and places them on the table The front
door opens and Doris bursts into the roon She is wearing
jeans turtleneck sweater Indian necklace headband long

So -- you wanta fuck

He takes an astonished moment to absorb this

GEORGE

GEORGE
Of course I did I just think

in snow trying to scrape the ice
off my windshield with a credit
card Besides there are a lot
of people out here with a lot of
money who dont know what to do
with it

bizarre appearance and resumes hanging up his clothes

GEORGE

Well you have to admit its a
bit odd becoming a school girl at
your age

Listen you think its easy being
the only one in the class with
clear skin

She gets off the bed moves to get something from her duffel
bag

GEORGE
What made you do it

DORIS
It was a dinner party that finally
pushed me into it Harrys boss
invited us over for dinner and I
just freaked

GEORGE
Why

She sits cross-legged on one of the chairs

DORIS
Id spent so much time with the
kids I didnt know if I was capable
of carrying on an intelligent con-
versation with anyone over the age
of five Anyway I went and was
seated next to the boss Well I
Surprised myself Ie talked -

his meat for him Thats when 1
decided Id better get out of the
house

GEORGE
Rut why school

She gets up moves to look out of window

DORIS
Its hard to explain I felt rest-

answers

GEORGE

What sort of answers

To find out where its really at
GEORGE

Jesus
DORIS

Whats the matter

GEORGE
That expression

DORIS
Okay- To find out who the hell

She raises her eyebrows gives him an amused look but he
misses the irony of his Statement signs check

DORIS
(amused)
When you were younger I dont
remember you as being exactly a
monk about that sort of thing

GEORGE
That was different Our relation-
ship was not based upon a casual
one-night stand

DORIS
(affectionately)
No its been fifteen one-night
stands
GEORGE

Its not the same Weve shared
things My God I helped deliver

DORIS
Remember I think of it as our
finest hour

She reaches across table squeezes his hand For a moment
he is caught up in the tenderness of the moment They get
up start to walk toward the foyer

Invent penicillin but get off

Surprised he turns to look at her

GEORGE
Thats not like you

She shrugs moves into room

DORIS
‘We seem to need something to bring
us closer together Maybe a really
lousy story about Helen will make
you appreciate me more

This finally gets a small smile from George

GEORGE
(sitting)
Okay

She drops crosslegged to the floor near his feet waits
expectantly

GEORGE
As you know she has this funny
sense of humor

DORIS
By funny I take it you mean
peculiar

most inappropriate times I had
signed this client -- very proper

tails to get acquainted with him
and his wife

GEORGE (Contd)

Well it was all pretty awkward but

we managed to get through the
drinks all right Then as we went
to leave instead of walking out
the front door I walked into the
hall closet Now that wasnt so

bad - I mean anybody can do that
The mistake I made was I stayed in
there

She looks at him for a moment bewildered

DORIS
You stayed in the closet

GEORGE
I wasnt sure if theyd seen me go
in I guess I figured Id stay

there until theyd gone away Okay

I admit I didnt think things
through I was in there for about
a minute before I realized Id --
well misjudged the situation
When I came out the three of them

were just staring at me All right

it was an embarrassing situation
but I probably could have carried
if off Except for what Helen did
You know what she did

DORIS
What

GEORGE
She peed on the carpet

She stares at him for a moment

DORIS
She did what

GEORGE
Oh not right away First she
started to laugh Her face was
all screwed up and she held her
sides and tears started to roll
down her face Then she peed all
over their Persian carpet

laughter)
What did you say

GEORGE
I said Youll have to excuse my
wife Ever since her last preg-
nancy shes had a problem Then
I offered to have the rug cleaned

DORIS
Did that help

GEORGE
They said it wasnt necessary
They had a maid

He stares at Doris who now helpless with laughter is pound-
ing the floor

GEORGE
You think this is funny

Doris manages to regain control

DORIS
Ive been meaning to tell you this
for years -- I just love Helen
GEORGE
(irritated)

Would she come off any worse if I
told you I lost the account

She looks at him for a Moment gets up

George has heard it all before His attitude is now one of
weary cynicism

There is a long pause as she stands transfixed trying to
absorb this

DORIS

Possibly he is wearing a mustache or a short beard
wearing an attractive kimono but during the scene will don
clothes and makeup that will project an image of expensive
After a moment or two she puts paper down looks
He smiles back at her

my side Makes me feel more
attractive

GEORGE
Why do you feel you need a valida-
tion of your attractiveness

During the following George completes putting on a neck

feedback

are trying to wi

den their emotional

horizons doesnt make the experience

learned to talk

as if youre

reasoning with someone about to

jump off a high

ledge

She is now dressed in very chic lounging pajamas She

presents her back to be zipped up
GEORGE
Okay -- okay I know I tend to

overcompensate for my emotionalism

loss of spontaneity Im working

Doris was supposed to act as a den
mother for your ten-year-old daughter
and her Indian guide group Well
she got hung up at the store and
was two hours late getting home
When she walked into the living room
she looked into the living room and
do you know what she saw’ A rather
overweight balding middle-aged man
witha feather on his head sitting
eross-legged on the floor very gravely
and gently telling a circle of totally
absorbedlittle girls what it was like
to bé in a World War II Japanese
prison camp She turned around
walked out sat in her car and thankea
God for being married to’a man like
you Areyou still there Harry
Well’ sometimes married people get
into an emotional’ straitjacket and
find it difficult to express how
they truly feel about each other
Total honesty is the key -- Yes
Ive known Doris for twenty ycars
and Im not ashamed to admit that
its been one of the most intimate
satisfying experience of my life

EXT GROUNDS - INN COTTAGE - DAY 74

A misty day in February 1977

LONG SHOT 75

We see Doris on the deck of the cottage arranging some red (X)
roses in a vase The vivid hue of the roses makes a small
splash of color against the muted tones of the misty day

As the camera moves in closer on Doris we see that she is

well dressed but her clothes are softer more traditionally
feminine and less fashionable than the last time we saw her

She takes the vase and moves back into cottage

INT INN COTTAGE - DAY 76

Doris puts vase of flowers on the piano admires them for a
moment then checks her wristwatch She has trouble seeing

it and has to hold it at arms length to find out the time (X)
(X)
She takes her purse and two books from the piano and moves (X)

to the dressing table She checks her face in the mirror and
then steps back and critically surveys her figure She presses
her stomach in with her hands She then sucks in her stomach
trying to hold it ina youthful posture She gives up exhales
breath lets stomach out She turns as the front door onens
and George enters His hair has been trimmed to a “conserva-
tively long length and his raincoat covers his comfortably
rumpled sports coat pants and turtleneck sweater They drink
one another in for a moment before they meet in the center of
the room and embrace affectionately

GEORGE
You feel good

GEORGE (Contd)

(pacing up

and down)
I was the one who got you back
together six years ago Why did
I do a stupid thing like that
I mean why was I so damned
generous

DORIS
Because you felt the same way about
Helen then as I do about Harry now

GEORGE
Whats that got to do with
anything

DORIS

‘If I hadnt gone back to Harry

you might have been stuck with me
permanently and you were terrified

He looks at her manages a sheepish grin

GEORGE
You could always see through me
couldnt you

DORIS -
Thats okay I always liked what
I saw

GEORGE
Well I want you now

DORIS
You can still have me once a year
Same time same place

He looks at her for a moment

GEORGE
(awkwardly sincerely)
Doris I need a wife Im just
not the kind of man who can live
alone I want you to marry me
but when I came here I knew there
was a chance youd say no

He continues to talk quickly without a break

hb 00355 124

76 - 11
GEORGE
What Im trying to say is -- without
you Ill probably end up with Connie
She knows -- all about you The

point is shes not the sort of
woman who would accept the situation
I suppose what Im saying is that
well never see each other again

He moves to take her hand sees that she is trembling

GEORGE
Doris for Gods sake -- marry me

DORIS
(finally torn)
I -- I cant

He moves away turns to look at her

GEORGE
I wish I could think of something
that would break your heart make
you burst into tears and come
away with me

DORIS
(shaky)
You know us Italians Irish We
never cry

He makes a gesture of helplessness

GEORGE
Yeah -- well I have to catch a
plane What time is it

She looks at her wristwatch but due to the combination of
misty eyes and bad eyesight she cant read it She

holds out her arm He moves to her takes her wrist looks
at watch

GEORGE
(puzzled)
Five fifty-five

DORIS
No its only two-thirty I always
keep my watch three hours and
twenty-five minutes fast

GEORGE
(puzzled)
How long have you been doing that

DORIS
Twenty-odd years
GEORGE
Why would anyone want to do a thing
like that
DORIS

Personal idiosyncrasy
There is an awkward pause as they stare at one another

GEORGE
Yeah - well ---

They embrace clumsily and awkwardly almost like two
strangers They break and he moves halfway to the door
turns

GEORGE
Who were your favorite movie stars

DORIS
Lon McAllister Cary Grant Marlon
Brando and Laurence Olivier

GEORGE
Youve come a long way

DORIS
We both have

He moves to door opens it turns
GEORGE
Always keep your watch three hours
and twenty-five minutes fast huh
She nods He makes a half-formed gesture of bewilderment
GEORGE
I cant believe this is happening
to us
He exits shutting the door behind him Doris stands for a
moment trying to absorb the shock of his Geparture Then
trancelike she gets her suitcase from the closet puts it

on the sofa and starts to pack but stops to look lovingly
around the room drinking in the memories

MEMORY FLASH 77

brush she threw hit

front door crashes open and George enters carrying his suit-
case

GEORGE

He throws his suitcase on the floor

DORIS
(astounded)
But -- But what about Connie

GEORGE
Connies eighty-seven years old

She stares at him speechless as he throws his raincoat and
hat down through following

GEORGE
Look I wanted you to marry me and
I figured if you thought someone
else wanted me I might stand a
better chance -- Okay maybe I
didnt think it through I was
desperate okay

She starts to laugh He turns to look at her

GEORGE
Look for once in my life I wanted
a happy ending Listen I dont
want to talk about it any more
Im back and Im going to keep coming
back every year until our bones are
too brittle to risk contact

She moves blindly into his arms and they cling to each other
tightly for a few long moments as we

SLOWLY DISSOLVE
EXT DECK - COTTAGE - INN - DAY - MED LONG SHOT 87
George and Doris their arms around each other come out

onto the deck take in the view for a moment before he helps
her down the steps to the grounds

ANOTHER ANGLE 88

As the camera pulls up and away until it takes in the grounds

00355 128

Finally Doris and George are two small figures her arm
through his as they move slowly through the grounds

chatting to each other like old good friends and we slowly

FADE OUT
