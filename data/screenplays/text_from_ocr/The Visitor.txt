piano Its a beautiful instrument

be that when your asylum case was
denied they let you go until your
appeal A lot of people didnt
bother with it Getting denied once
was enough to spook them

WALTER
So what happens if thats the case

MR SHAH

Its still a long shot Like I
said the Governments approach has
changed radically
