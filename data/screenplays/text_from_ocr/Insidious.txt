INSIDIOUS

Written by

Leigh Whannell

The universe is deathless

Is deathless because having no finite self

it stays infinite

A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead
of himself

By not confining himself to himself

sustains himself outside himself

FADE IN

INT DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT

A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface
white like the moon

In the darkness the towers metal skin is barely visible
We ROTATE AROUND revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP

not rising up from a surface but hanging down from a white
ceiling The bulb unlit

Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence
a sleeping child Chest rising and falling with each breath
We HOVER over the young boywatching him A blanket
emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs His
mouth is slack eyelids twitching to dreams unseen

The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for

We move away from him exploring the dark room Strewn with

toys The door is slightly ajar We float through it into--

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
His

--a long hallway Even darker than the bedroom And without
the boys rhythmic breathing even quieter

A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach
Someone is standing in front of it
The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away We

follow it tentative Turning a corner we see the figure
Standing in a doorway

Now we can make out the edges of the person It is an old
woman Hair in a Victorian bun A corseted dress

She stares at us

WOMAN
Let me in

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eyes flick open

A woman blinks awake gazing around the room Another
bedroom Sparse Just a bed and a cabinet It is 543 AM

Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark
heaving snores have woken her up

She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT With a quiet
determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks

but the lines of age are creeping in

She has settled into the ‘comfort years of a marriage hair
pinned up messily wearing dowdy pajamas

She beholds her husband taking him in Considering him He
snorts and smacks his lips Very unflattering

She climbs out of bed

INT LIVING ROOM LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
boxes

away

High ceilings Exposed beams Spanish style windows

Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
room No matter careful she is there is a loud creak with
each step A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily

There is barely any furniture in here only a BOOKCASE and a
PIANO What there is a lot ofis boxes Large moving

Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
the boxes marked BOOKS She plucks out a handful of books
and lines them up on the bookshelf Then another handful

They are all self-help and self-improvement books Titles
like “Be The Better You and “Inch By Inch Its A Cinch A
Guide To Achieving Your Goals pop out

She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS She strips

the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos

Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages The
happy couple Young Glowing Sadness washes over her

VOICE (0S)
Mom

She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT Her
son He approaches her rubbing his eyes (It is not the boy

we saw in the opening scene)

RENAT
What are you doing up kiddo

DALTON
I dont like my room

RENAI
Youll get used to it Its only
your first night

He climbs into her lap She bites on his ear playfully

RENAI (CONTD)
Argh Im going to eat you

DALTON
What are you looking at
RENAT
Just some photos

DALTON
What photos

She hefts another album from the box prying it open A
photo
of a grinning young girl greets them hair in pigtails

RENAI
Do you know who that is

DALTON
No

RENAT
Thats me

DALTON

It doesnt look like you

RENAT
I know Im so happy there But
its me When I was your age I was
a kid once too you know

DALTON
No you werent

Renai bursts out laughing She is famous for her big laugh

RENAT
Thanks Maybe youre rightI dont
remember being this person at all
I hope she smiled like that all the
time whoever she was

She sizes up her son The living embodiment of the photo

RENAI (CONTD)
This is a terrible thing to admit
Dalton but sometimes I get jealous of
you That youre so young That you
havent made any of your decisions yet

DALTON
I dont wanna grow old
RENAT
Well it starts happening to us
from the moment were born

She points to the hands on the grandfather clock

RENAI (CONTD)
Every time that clock ticks we all
get a little bit older

She turns the page in the photo album seeing an old man

RENAI (CONTD)
Thats your grandpa You wouldnt
remember him

DALTON
He smells like smoke

RENAI
Yeahgood memory He did smoke
that god awful pipe didnt he

DALTON
Show me a picture of dad when he
was a little kid

RENAT
I dont even know if we have any
Hes hopeless with keeping photos

DALTON
Show me a picture of me when I was
a little kid

RENAT
Your pictures are all in the computer
Nobody keeps photo albums like this
anymore theyre ancient relics They
should I like being able to touch
something instead of it floating
around in cyber world If the laptop
breaks your whole existence is erased

DALTON
What was I like when I was a little kid

RENAT
You are a little kid

She kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes

RENAI (CONTD)
If only you knew what I know

We hear a baby crying off screen

RENAI (CONTD)
You certainly didnt cry as much as
your little sister does Come on

JOSH LAMBERT gapes into the mirror face covered in
soap

He washes it off Now hes awake we see that he is a

clean-cut guy - a former high school nerd who got revenge by
growing into his body

He sorts through a box labelled JOSHS BATHROOM STUFF
He takes out two bottles - TONER and MOISTURIZER He dabs

toner on then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and
around his eyes

He suddenly notices a grey hair Looks mortified

JOSH

He plucks it out wincing melodramatically

JOSH (CONTD)

She threads the tie into a knot for him
JOSH

MALE STUDENT 1
Charles Darwin

JOSH

is famous for

MALE STUDENT 1
He said that people descended from
monkeys

JOSH
Half right He wrote a seminal book
that explained his theories on
natural selection and how the
different species on this planet -
including humans - evolved

ALANSO
I know I didnt evolve from no
monkey Shit

Everyone laughs

JOSH
Humans actually have a lot in
common with monkeys or more
specifically chimpanzees

ALANSO
Maybe you do but I was created in
the image of my Dios

He takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his
shirt
kissing it and holding it up That gets another laugh

JOSH
I respect your right to believe
that Alanso But I want to give
you all possible theories I want
this class to go out into the world
with an informed opinion
ALANSO
The theory is incorrect Mr Lambert

JOSH
How can it be incorrect Its a
theory A scientific theory

ALANSO
Yeah well science is bullshit We
didnt get here cos of no test-tubes

JOSH
Alanso if you keep talking like
that Im going to ask you to visit
the principal

ALANSO
Fine

He gets up and leaves as the class JEERS and BOOS

INT LIVING ROOM LAMBERT HOME - DAY
Peace and quiet at last

Renai gropes in behind the bookcase plucking a hidden
jewelry
box free She pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it

She sits down at her piano feeling the keys warming her
fingers up Sunlight streams in through the windows

She takes out a notebook filled with scribbled handwriting

She places the notebook on the sheetstand then sets a
small

mechanical METRONOME in motion and begins tapping out a
sombre

melody in time with it

RENAT

(SINGING)
Yeah Im looking west always been
looking that way gonna get it all
happening just cant do it today

She stops and makes a note in her book She starts over
rising to the emotion of the song Shes got a good voice
of

is

RENAI (CONTD)
(SINGING)
Yeah Im looking west always been
looking that way Im gonna be
somebody just cant be her today--

She is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying

She stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor the
source of the noise

Renai deflates her shoulders sagging in defeat She closes
her notebook and leaves the room

INT CALIS NURSERY - DAY

Renai scoops up Cali rocking her gently

A scratching sound interrupts Rough Frantic Like a dog
pawing at something

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Renai steps into the hall curious She can still hear it
She follows the sound to a door Grabs the door handle

The sound abruptly ceases

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
The door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set
stairs that descend into a gloomy basement

Renai stands at the top of the stairs squinting into the
inky blackness straining to see

She reaches up and yanks a light chain illuminating a bare
bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space

The basement is large and completely bare Cleaned out

Renai takes a step down She is still carrying Cali

FURTHER DOWN below her we see that there is one step that
now

inside

out

him

cracked and broken

She takes another step The broken step is right below her

One more step and she will fall

Cali squeals happily Renai pausesthen turns around
heading back up the stairs Stops when she sees something

DEEP VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKSrunning downwards on the

of the dooras if someone were trying to claw their way

EXT LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT

A Spanish-style home Very pretty This is not the suburbs
More of an inner city neighborhood Theres history here

Josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru

INT LIVING ROOM LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
The house almost looks liveable

Foster is watching loud zany cartoons on TV Cali is ina
high chair Renai is folding boxes She has unpacked most of
the living room and is very tired

Josh ambles in sees the work Renai has done

JOSH
Look at this Nice job

Foster bolts over and crashes into his dads legs hugging

JOSH (CONTD)
Whoa buddy Slow down

RENAT
Josh wheres the box of my lamps

JOSH
I dont know They should be here
We packed them up

RENAT
Yeah I packed them Theyre not here

JOSH
I remember the movers bringing them
in and putting them right there
RENAT
(PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)
Well theyre not here I would
know Ive been unpacking this
stuff all day
INT CORRIDOR LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT

Dalton wanders the hall sporting a red superhero CAPE and
carrying a plastic glowing light-sabre toy

He reaches a door The basement door He pulls it open

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Dalton holds up his light-sabre the glow allowing him to
make out the murky corners of the basement below

He takes a step down the stairs Then another step
The broken step is right below him
He steps again --

-- and falls Flails forward tumbling down the steps all
the way to the bottom His light sabre SHATTERS

He hits the ground his head smacking the floor

All is dark

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Josh sits with Foster zoned out in front of the droning TV

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT
Pitch black

Dazed Dalton sits up His head is cut and bleeding He is
alone in the dark He stares into the corner of the
surrounding cell
His eyes adjust making out a shape
A shadow

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Josh and Renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a
SCREAM

They spring into action scrambling to their feet

RENAT
Dalton Where are you

He doesnt answer Just keeps screaming

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Renai and Josh whip the door open glaring into the basement
from the top of the stairs

RENAT
Dalton

Dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps sobbing his
red cape gathered around him

Renai flicks the light on Her and Josh scamper down the
steps propping Dalton up

JOSH
What happened

DALTON
I fell

RENAT

Dalton you have to be careful You
shouldnt be coming down here in
the dark

JOSH
Where do you hurt the most

DALTON
My knee and my head I cant stand
up

by

the

Josh lifts him to his feet A severely grazed knee is dotted
with blood Hes okay

JOSH
You scared us champ

Josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs
Renai glances around the basement her eyes landing on the
lone object that resides in it

She frowns It wasnt there when she saw the basement last

It is a box One of her large cardboard moving boxes

It is marked LAMPS

INT DALTONS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dalton is lying in bed a band-aid slapped across his
forehead Renai tucks him in Josh standing over him

JOSH
Youre lucky you dont need stitches

RENAI
If I catch you falling down the
stairs again Im gonna break your
neck

DALTON
That doesnt make sense

There are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall all drawn
Dalton Josh taps one a drawing of Dalton flying through
night sky wearing his cape

DALTON (CONTD)
You might be a superhero but youre
not invincible Be more careful bud

Renai kisses him and gets up

RENAT
Sleep tight honey
They wave goodbye and turn out the light

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Renai flops into bed beside Josh exhausted

JOSH
Weve gotta lock that door

RENAT
Hes such a boy He goes off
exploring Sometimes I wanna keep
him on one of those child leashes

JOSH
Why bother with a child leash Ill
stop at the pet store tomorrow

She laughs and cuddles up to him resting her head on his
chest

RENAT
Im sorry I was pissy when you got
home I was trying to work on a
song today and then Cali woke up
and wouldnt stop crying

JOSH
didnt even notice

RENAI
feel guilty for wanting my own
time
JOSH

ts normal to want your own time

RENAI
s it My mother gave up everything
for me I keep waiting for the
completely selfless parent gene to
ick in but Im exactly the same
person I was when I was 22 only
now Im married with kids

JOSH
Youre a great mother

RENAI
No Im not They like you so much
better than me

JOSH
Thats not true

RENAI
Youre the cool dad who comes home
with presents and Im the one who
yells at them all day

JOSH
Now youre being crazy They love
you At least you get to connect
with them I work so much

RENAI
Believe me youre their hero They
try to play us off against each
other Theyre master manipulators
I guess they really are my kids

Josh laughs A lull settles over them

RENAI (CONTD)
Is this it Josh

JOSH
Is this so bad

She doesnt answer They sit in silence for a long beat

RENAI
Thank you for letting me take some time
off to work on my music again

JOSH
Well get by I want you to do it

RENAT
Theres a couple of songsI mean
not all of them but theres a
couple of them that I think are
really good And I think maybe I
could do something with them

JOSH
I love all your songs

They kiss

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It is 3AM All the remoteness of that hour is present
herewe can feel it

As still and quiet as deep space

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

The formerly bustling kitchen is now a museum at midnight

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

A long dark thoroughfare A ticking clock its only

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Stairs swallowed up by darkness The groan of settling wood

Another day another chaotic breakfast

Foster waves a stuffed toy around Josh charges in bits of

tissue on his face from shaving cuts Cali flails her arms
in

her high chair Renai is at the sink whisking eggs

RENAT
Foster sit down honey

She whips a look around

RENAI (CONTD)
Where is Hey Josh could you go

We FOLLOW Josh as he marches down the corridor to Daltons
bedroom poking his head inside

INT DALTONS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Josh knocks on the wall

JOSH
Time to get up my man Come on

Nothing from Dalton He doesnt even stir Josh rolls his
eyes and walks in Nudges Dalton with his knee

JOSH (CONTD)
Youre making me look bad here
Outta bed before your mother comes
in and kills both of us

Nothing Hes really out
Josh reaches down and shakes Dalton vigorously

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton get up Youve gotta get
ready for school

Josh waits for a response but none comes Dalton is as
slack

as a puppet Something resembling concern crosses Joshs
face

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton

He kneels down shaking Dalton hard He listens for
breathing

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton Dalton DALTON

His scream takes us into--

INT HOSPITAL ROOM ICU UNIT - DAY
--the stern sterility of a hospital

Josh and Renai eyes lined by dark circles stand in front

of
a dour neurologist DR JOEL SERCARZ Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue They are red with tears
Beyond a window in front of them lying on a gurney in an
ICU

chamber is the unconscious body of Dalton

DR SERCARZ

Okayas of yet our tests have
not drawn any conclusive answers
for you Repeated blood and CSF
cultures are normal making an
infective origin highly unlikely
Tests for Lyme disease and repeated
polymerase chain reaction are
negative Systemic vasculitis was
ruled out Dalton remains in an
areactive coma without focal signs
or abnormal brainstem reflexes

Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold multi-syllable
medical terminologylike stranded tourists keeping up with
a foreign language

DR SERCARZ (CONTD)
Weve looked for bacterial
pathogens like Meningoencephalitis
but havent seen anything

(MORE)

DR SERCARZ (CONTD)

I wouldnt say weve exhausted
every single anglebut were
close The underlying cause is
still unknown
Josh and Renai look in at their boy

DR SERCARZ (CONTD)

The good news is that hes
breathing without the use of a
mechanical apparatus and there are
no lesions or hemorrhages in any of
the CT scans

JOSH
Sotheres no brain damage or

DR SERCARZ

None that weve detected Technically
hes in a coma He doesnt respond to
stimuli he has no sleep-wake cycle but
theres no brain trauma or infection His
scans are normal To be honest Ive
never seen anything like it

JOSH
That fall he tookI mean it looked
like he hit his head pretty hard

DR SERCARZ

We definitely exhausted that
possibility but it was always
doubtful The cut was superficial
there wasnt even a skull fracture

RENAI
He cant just not wake uptheres
got to be something

Renai sobs tears streaming down her face Josh looks like a
deer in the headlights Stunned dumb

Sercarz clears his throat This part of the job isnt his
specialty

DR SERCARZ
Im sorry

JOSH
So what do we do now Does he stay here

DR SERCARZ

Well conduct some further testing but
beyond thatI really dont know

His pager goes off He checks it
DR SERCARZ (CONTD)

Excuse me for a minute I have to
step out A nurse will be with you

in just a moment

He leaves quickly Josh and Renai press on the glass
separated in body and spirit from their son

FADE TO BLACK

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE TWO MONTHS LATER

INT DALTONS BEDROOM LAMBERT HOME - DAY
A ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom

Dalton lies on his bed a heart rate monitor hooked to his
chest IV tubes run into his arms a Nasogastric feeding

tube

into his mouth

A young nurse ADELE CHALFIN checks the various tubes

as Renai watches on

ADELE

Are you having any more trouble

with the feeding tube

Renai looks broken the life drained from her A wilted
flower

She shakes her head her voice a low rasp

RENAT
(BARELY AUDIBLE)
Its okay

ADELE
Alright well Ill be back soon
Ill bring some new books Youre
probably sick of the ones you have

RENAI
Did he respond to any of the tests

Adele pauses
next

statue

ADELE
Nono he didnt But we have to
give it time Ive seen coma
patients with a much longer
inactivity time suddenly start

making noises

RENAT
Hes not in a coma remember They
dont know what to call it They
dont know what to do with him so
theyve given up
ADELE
No they havent Were going to
figure it out
Adele hugs her then exits Renai slumps down on a chair

to her son

The heart rate monitor pings Dalton is as still asa

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Renai shuffles down the corridor She passes a bedroom door
then stops and doubles back pushing it open and going into-

INT CALIS NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
--the babies room

She stares into the cribat her other sleeping baby She
sets the baby monitor and walks out softly

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Renai slumps in front of her piano Taps one of the keys
She plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand
present enough to hear it

She stops and buries her face in her hands
murmur

Renais

Then she hears it Whispering

Its so low you would miss it if the house wasnt absolutely
silent Renai looks up scanning for the source of the

It is coming from the baby monitor

Confused Renai picks up the monitor turning up the volume
all the way up The hissssssss of static fills the room

She presses her ear to the device then hears it again - a
hushed WHISPER almost indistinct from the static save for

the whistle of sibilants

VOICE
(FROM MONITOR)
They see usall of uswe have to be
quickthis life begs us to come back
The whisper trails offmore static
VOICE (CONTD)
(FROM MONITOR)
Renai drops the baby monitor leaping out of her skin at the
sound of the scream Nerves fried

The monitor smashes on the floor All is quiet

Renai moves to the door staring down the corridor at the
door to Calis nursery

It is open only a crack She hears crying Cali is crying

We follow her as she bolts towards the nursery smashing
through the door eyes filled with terror seeing--

--nothing

INT NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
Renai stalks into the room
The room is empty save for Cali crying in her crib

eyes land on the closet
ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET

Through a slight crack we see Renai approach Breath
quivering Her hand reaches out She FLINGS the door open

It is empty

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
The family is eating Its very quiet

Foster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence
Suddenly Cali breaks the quiet squealing happily

CALI
Dadda

Josh looks up smiling Amazed

JOSH

She said dad

Neither Renai nor Foster even look up

INT FOSTERS BEDROOM - NIGHT
A bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow

Renai gathers up scattered toys from the floor relocating
them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment

Foster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar
system

Renai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate crumpled
next to a school bag It says IN RECOGNITION OF SCIENCE
SKILL AWARDED TO FOSTER LAMBERT ON 31410

RENAT
Whats this

FOSTER
An award

RENAT

Thats todays date You got this
today
Foster nods meekly

RENAI (CONTD)
Why didnt you tell us honey

She sits on the edge of his bed He stares at the wall

strokes his hair

RENAI (CONTD)
I know its hard right now But
things will get better I promise

Foster nods

RENAI (CONTD)
Im going to show this to your dad

She plants a kiss his forehead and stands up

FOSTER
Im scared mom

RENAT
Scared of what

FOSTER
Dalton

Renai sits back down

RENAT
Were all scared Its normal to be
scared for him But we cant give up--

FOSTER
Why do I have to sleep so close to
him Cant I change rooms

RENAI
Why would you wanna change rooms

Foster swallows

FOSTER
I dont know

Renai stares at her son She kisses him again

RENAI
Your brother needs you Goodnight

She

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Josh lies in bed reading Fosters award Renai is beside
him

RENAI
Something happened today I didnt
want to tell you in front of Foster

JOSH
What

RENAT
I heard something coming from
Calis room A mans voice On the
baby monitorit scared the hell
outta me I went in there and no
one was there

JOSH
Could it have been interference

RENAT
I dont know It was so clear I
was sitting at the piano and I
heard thiswhispering on the baby
monitor So I held my ear up to it--

SUDDENLY - a noise interrupts An arrhythmic KNOCKING sound
like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing
It is the front door

JOSH
Who the hell is that

Josh knows its his job to check but he doesnt want to

JOSH (CONTD)
Stay here

He gets up

INT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Josh approaches the front door flashlight in hand He peers
through curtains at the front step
Its too dark to see anything

JOSH
Hello Whos there

Only the wind replies

He aims the flashlight at the glass shining it into the
thick darkness There is no one on the front step

Josh presses the flashlight against the window arcing the
beam across his front garden Leans in close to the glass

AND THEN--

Nothing Theres no one there

He makes sure the door is locked then flips open a security

system panel on the wall pecking at the buttons on it

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Renai sits up in bed listening Hears nothing

until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the
baby

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Renai surveys the living room It is a total mess

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Water cascades out of a faucet Steam rises from the water

Renai lets bath salts fall into the tub She almost looks
relaxed just smelling them

She starts to undress then turns --

-- and YELPS in fright

A person is standing behind the distorted glass window
staring in at her

The shape of the persons head and shoulders can clearly be
seen but the glass is too opaque to make out any features

Renai slips grabbing the sink When she glances up the
figure is gone

Trembling Renai opens the window Very very slowly

It is fifteen feet off the ground with a sheer drop below

EXT LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT

Renai sits on the front steps alone It is late She looks
somehow tired and wired at the same time Smoking a

JOSH
When did you start smoking

RENAI
Youve been coming home late every
single night Youve never had to
do that in all of the years youve
been at the school Now all of a
sudden you have to stay back late

JOSH
I dont like it either but Im
grading tests What choice do I have
Weve gotta pay Daltons bills

RENAT
Your mother is paying Daltons
bills Josh I know because she

reminds me every chance she gets

JOSH
Jesus I cant win with you Thats
my son in there too not just yours

He paces the anger sobering him

JOSH (CONTD)
Ive always felt like less than
good enough for you I feel it
every time you mention our bills
That subtle voice that says ‘cant
you get a job that pays more than a
teacher And now I cant even look
at you without feeling it

RENAI
Youre projecting that onto me
Youve written an entire story
about Im how Im feeling without
once asking me how Im feeling

JOSH
I dont need to ask I know you

RENAI
himself

twitches

I am losing my mind here in this
house Josh Im scared and I need

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Josh snoozes head arched at a bad angle His back will
regret sleeping on this couch
back

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Renai tosses and turns restless in sleep
Her eyes open and she sucks in a breath Bad dreams

She blinks and looks around the room surprised to be alone
sitting up in fright Until she remembers why She eases

onto the bed Then she looks over at the window

There is a man standing outside it

He is not looking in at herhe is pacing back and forth
furiously smoking a cigarette Back and forth back and
forth Agitated He has long black greasy hair and a grey
jacket

Every muscle in Renais body freezes She becomes a glacier
Her eyes are drilled to the man unable to move By sheer
will she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door

Opens her mouth but no words will come Finally--

RENAT
JooshJoshJosh

She glances back at the window
THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM

He paces back and forth between the bed and the window just
as he was outside ignoring Renai Smoking like a fiend

And then suddenly he stops pacing Looks up Straight at
Renai - as if just realizing she was there

For a moment their eyes are locked in silence

and then the mans face contorts in anger and he CHARGES
towards her arms outstretched GROWLING in fury

MAN
DONT YOU FUCKING DARE

Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint A
cry from the depths of her soul

She propels herself backward falling off the bed and
scrambling back into the corner
Josh CHARGES into the room flicking on the light--
--seeing only Renai huddled in the corner screaming

JOSH
What is it What is it

Renai is incoherent She cannot stop screaming Josh grabs
her by the shoulders

JOSH (CONTD)
Renai what is wrong

RENAT
The man -- he was there -- he tried
to -- there was a man there

Foster runs into the room visibly terrified He sees his
mother and instantly begins crying He runs to his dad
holding onto his leg

In the background Cali begins crying her screams
contributing to an overwhelming din

JOSH
Theres no one here

RENAT
I saw somebody

JOSH
Theres no one here

RENAI
Dont you dare not believe me

JOSH
I believe you okay I just dont

FOSTER

The realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai

All is suddenly silent save for the cries of Cali in the
background Josh holds his son tight

Speaking for myself Im not used
to this kind of stuff

SPECS

six per cent of the people we deal
with have had no experience with
this type of phenomena before

He takes out a notepad and pen

SPECS (CONTD)
I would like to start by

Pleased to meet you Im Elise

Elise takes her hat off and scans the room taking a deep
breath Tucker jabbers eager to please

TUCKER
We took Tri-field and EMF readings of
the whole house All the wiring
alarm clocks radios toasters TV
record player fuse box Nothing went
off the charts

ELISE
And the previous home

Tucker and Specs look at each other Oh shit

SPECS
Tucker hadnt monitored that yet I
could jump on that this afternoon
if you like Make up for lost time

TUCKER
Yeah but who would work the
equipment Ill need to be there
You know what dont even sweat it
Ill make myself available

ELISE
No thats fine gentlemen

She stares up at the ceiling as if seeing something they

cant
ELISE (CONTD)
I dont think bad wiring is the
problem here
She drifts over to the bookshelf her hand landing on the
stack

of photo albums Renai looked through in the opening scene
ELISE (CONTD)

Renai and Josh exchange a look
bag

ELISE (CONTD)
May I walk through the house

RENAT
Yes Of course

ELISE
Steven do you have your sketchbook

Specs hurriedly fishes a sketchbook and pencil out of his

SPECS
Yes I do Yes I do Yes yes I
do

ELISE

Good Were going to need it

RENAT
What is it for

SPECS
She tells me what she sees and I
draw it Its the most important
part of her process

TUCKER
His drawings and my photos comprise
her visual records

SPECS
Especially the drawings

TUCKER
Thats debatable

SPECS
Its not debatable

TUCKER
It is but whatever

SPECS
Onwards and upwards Find me a ghost

Elise begins walking through the house Tucker and Specs
trail her and we FOLLOW THEM into the--

INT CORRIDOR NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
--hallway

Renai and Josh stay back sheepish Elise stalks forward at
the front surveying every nook and cranny of the house

Elise stops suddenly She is staring straight at a corner of
the hallway next to the grandfather clock

RENAT
What is it

ELISE
There is something here

TUCKER
This is where I saw it

Elise calmly mutters something to Specs in a low voice but
we have trouble hearing it - only snatches of key words

ELISE
long hairgrey dressher
eyes are

He immediately starts sketching His line drawings are fast
but detailed Impressive

He outlines the wall the ceiling lamp the grandfather
clock

And then something else

Two young women Standing next to the grandfather clock
dressed in Amish garb Even in the roughness of the drawing
we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin

Tucker takes out a camera snaps some shots Josh and Renai
step forward seeing the sketch

Elise keeps moving heading straight for one door in
particular She stops running her hand over the wood

ELISE (CONTD)
Do I have permission to enter this
room

JOSH
Go ahead

ELISE
Maybe you could wait back there

Josh and Renai hug each other Tucker lowers the camera
Elise grips the door handle and turns it

INT DALTONS BEDROOM - DAY

The door groans open

Dalton is lying on his gurney surrounded by the sluggish
drone of hospital equipment The curtains are drawn and the
room is dark

Elise hesitatesthen steps inside

ELISE
Leave the lights off

Elise steps closer to Dalton She runs her hands over his
prone body She shivers as she does

A ripple of fear passes through her Her breath quickens

Slowlyvery very slowly she gazes up at a corner of
the ceiling Her eyes WIDEN and the look on her face
SHOULD
BE
ABSOLUTE

TERROR

Her arm raises up her finger extending and pointing at the
corner she is glaring at

RENAT
What is it What do you see

Elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to Specs
keeping her eyes GLUED to the far corner of the ceiling We
cannot hear what she is whispering

Hand shaking Specs feverishly starts to sketch We cannot
see what he is drawing

RENAI (CONTD)
What do you see

The strokes of Specs pencil become faster and rougher
keeping up with Elises whispers Sweat dots his forehead
ceiling

all

Tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively
He holds up his Viewmaster

POV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - we see the far corner of the

change color as Tucker rotates the lenses insidebut
nothing out of the ordinary appears Just a ceiling

RENAI (CONTD)
Tell me

Suddenly Renai charges forward snatching the sketch book

The drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of
the ceiling staring down at Dalton below It is the RED-
FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier

His naked body is charcoal blackwhilst also strangely
translucent the veins visible underneath the flesh A
corpulent stomach juts out as if he were pregnant

Terrified Renai flicks on the light --

-- revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - DAY
Elise holds court in the living room

Renai and Josh hold each other struggling to comprehend it

ELISE
Im not sure if you are ready to
hear this yetbut unfortunately I
cant waste any time easing you
into it There is no time left

She takes a deep breath preparing herself

ELISE (CONTD)
I want you to know that this is
what I believe and it may
contradict a previous medical
diagnosis However you called me
here and I am taking that as an
acceptance of my readings

RENAI
Go on

ELISE
Your sonis not in a coma His
physical body is here but his
spiritual body is not

(BEAT)
The reason these disturbances
followed you to a new home is
becauseit is not the house that
is haunted It is your son

This is too much for Josh Renai however wants to listen

RENAI

I dont understand

Elise considers what she is about to say carefully

ELISE
Have you ever heard of astral
projection

RENAT
Out of body experiences

Elise nods

ELISE
call them travellers These are
people with the ability to leave
their physical body and travel to
different places in an astral form
To some degree we all have the
ability to do itbut most of us
subconsciously suppress it or dont
now how to access it

Josh shakes his head agitated Renai leans forward
desperate for an answer to her terror

ELISE (CONTD)
Dalton isa very accomplished
astral projector He has been since
he was very young Hes not afraid
of his ability And that lack of
fear has led him to travel too far
and become lost

RENAI
Lost Lost where

Elise gazes up at the ceiling as if looking into another
world

ELISE
In The Further

RENAT
What do you mean

ELISE
The Further is that place beyond our
perception beyond our understanding
of the physical world that we can see
and touch It is a place without
clocks or measurements without past
or futurean infinite realm that
holds all of our dreamsand all of
our nightmares

She turns to look at them

ELISE (CONTD)
That is where Dalton is

Renai cries unprepared for what she is hearing

ELISE (CONTD)
The problem is that with his astral
body gone he has left a physical
body with us An empty vessel

Josh cant meet her gaze

ELISE (CONTD)
And there are entities that know
this They can smell it - the
chance to live again That is why
they have gathered around him

RENAI
How many are there

ELISE
There are five benevolent spirits
Five different entities for whom
Dalton has become a most prized
possession They are trying to get
inside his physical bodyand they
get closer with each passing day

Her words hang in the air like gunsmoke Pure fear courses
through Joshs eyes He fidgets agitated

ELISE (CONTD)
Then there are two entities who
arenot benevolent One of them
takes the form of a man the
other

She holds up the drawing that Specs di

ELISE (CONTD)
They work together so desperate
are they to possess Dalton They
are the closest of all the entities
to getting inside him

(BEAT)
I dont want to scare you but I
have never in all my years of
doing this experienced anything as
terrifying as their presence

RENAI
Is there a way to bring Dalton back

ELISE

There is something we could try A
way of calling him back I would
need your complete trust

Josh cant take it any more He stands up

JOSH
No No This has gone too far

RENAT
You said that youd give her a chance

JOSH
I have given her a chance and I
did that because I wanted to help
you But I cannot have somebody
telling us that the reason our son
is in a coma is because his soul is
floating off somewhere in another
dimension

ELISE
I know this is hard to hear

JOSH
No its not fair is what it is
Youre preying on peoples grief and
vulnerability which is really easy
to do in a situation like this

RENAI
Why did we go to all the trouble of
bringing them here if youre just
going to reject what they say

JOSH
Because I wanted to help you To
put your mind at ease and if this
helped then great But to drag
Dalton into this No

RENAT
Josh youre not being fair

JOSH
Fair How did the voice of reason
become the bad guy here Dont you
see You want to believe Of course
you do honey anybody would

The room goes quiet Josh turns to Elise

JOSH (CONTD)
Look I appreciate what youre
trying to do I really do But I
think its dangerous to start
throwing out false hope like this
I have to put my foot down My wife
is notmentally well at the
moment and I have to keep at least
one of her feet here in the real
world

RENAT
You never believed me

JOSH
Honey Im on your side But I
genuinely think this is dangerous
and frankly a little exploitative

He turns to Elise Specs and Tucker
self

JOSH (CONTD)
You come into a home with a
seriously ill child you make a
tenuous connection between him and
these experiences Renai is having
and viola - the client starts
crying because theyre desperate to
believe the tears validate your
power thank you thatll be six
hundred dollars please

SPECS
We reject more cases than we take
Were not out for money sir

JOSH
I know I knowlook I appreciate
your interest and your time I do
Thank you Thank you very much

He goes to the front door opening it

ELISE
I completely understand And I
honestly dont blame you for
reacting like this

She walks to the door followed by Specs and Tucker
sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly

RENAT
No pleasedont go

ELISE

Thank you for your time

They exit The door closes They are gone

INT MASTER BEDROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

who

Renai lies in bed awakea broken shell of her former

A bottle of anti-depressants sits on the bedside table

Josh enters the bedroom Sits down beside her

JOSH
Look at me for a second honey
(BEAT)
Look at me

She doesnt look up

JOSH (CONTD)
Did you really believe what she
said In your heart of hearts did
you actually take what she was
saying literally

A long beat of silence passes

RENAT
I dont know

JOSH
Do you think I dont want to
believe in that stuff Of course I
do It would make life a lot easier
if I did If I believed that some
supernatural force was responsible
for whats happened to our son

RENAT
I dont believe anything anymore
Josh I used to I used to believe
that I could keep my children safe
I used to believe everything would
be okay To believe in something
you have to know it to be true

She turns and looks at him

RENAI (CONTD)
The things that have happened to me
havent confirmed any beliefs -
theyve done the opposite Theyve
made me question what I believe
(MORE)

RENAI (CONTD)
Theyve made me realize that maybe
we dont know as much as we think
we do

Josh paces at his wits end
RENAI (CONTD)

You ask me if I believe what she
said to be true and the answer is I
the

hand

dont know But let me ask you this
- in your heart of hearts can you
say for certain that it isnt

INT MASTER BEDROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Josh lies beside Renai who is sleeping He is wide awake
staring at the ceiling

He gets out of bed

INT DALTONS BEDROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
The door opens

All is mute as Josh enters skulking carefully through the
darkness

The curtains lull in the slightest of breezes
Josh stands over Dalton

He stares down at his sons body then lets his gaze drift
around the roompast the CLOSET past the DRAWINGS pinned
to the wall and the TOYBOXall the way to the CORNER of

ceiling that Elise was so frightened of Joshs eyes drill
into the shadows

Is there something waiting there

Finally Josh sits down beside Dalton He grips his sons

JOSH
Where are you Where did you go
(BEAT)
Can you hear me Im begging you to
show me that you can hear meI
dont know how to help you Please
tell me what to do

Joshs torment fills the airbut Dalton doesnt move

JOSH (CONTD)
Please God please help megive

just to have him back

up

stars

Josh studies Daltons face for a response Nothing Not a
twitch He collapses forward onto Dalton Holding him tight

JOSH (CONTD)
I need him back I need him to show
me that he can hear me Please
For a moment all we can hear is Joshs breathing

Thensomething happens Something Josh doesnt see

Daltons face twitches It is a very slight movement This
movement is followed by something that is hard to miss--

One of the tacks pinning one of Daltons drawings to the
begins to wind loose

It pops free shooting across the room like a kernel of
popcornfollowed by another tack

The second tack lands in Joshs lap Puzzled he picks it

examining it He looks up his eye drawn to the picture on
the wall

With total astonishment he sees the two remaining tacks
works themselves free popping out of the wall

The drawing floats down to the ground

Josh stoops down picking it up

It is a drawing split into two halves The left half is a
self portrait of Dalton lying in bed looking down from
above

The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly

and bloated planets

Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side
flying above the house with another man

At the bottom of the first drawing Dalton has written “Last
night I watched myself sleep

A tear falls down Joshs face He begins to cry Deep and
painful tears he has long pent up
away

Beneath the second drawing Dalton has written “Then I flew

INT MASTER BEDROOM NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Renais eyes flutter open She glances over No one is

INT KITCHEN NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
Renai shuffles into the kitchen

Josh is sitting at the kitchen table staring at Daltons
drawing He hasnt slept and looks it He looks up at her

JOSH
Okay

Renai approaches Josh and they hugholding on for dear

EXT NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

The Lambert house is lit from within Like a Jack-O-Lantern

INT DALTONS ROOM - NIGHT
Action stations

Tucker sets up two stills cameras around Daltons room
zipping back and forth between the two tripods Specs opens
up a kit taking out his notepad and a pencil

A small circular table has been set up adjacent to

bed Elise sits at the table flanked on either side by Josh
and Renai

ELISE
Whats most important is that you
realize no two attempts are the
same I will be completely honest
with you about the results and if
no dialogue is established I will
tell you I am not in the business
of embellishing success What
happens happens
Josh and Renai nod grimly truly out of their depth

ELISE (CONTD)
Forget the limits and laws and logic
of this world We are treading ina
different place now

Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the
corner
holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA

TUCKER
These still cameras are rigged to
pick up changes in the atmosphere
electrical or temperature-wise Dont
be alarmed if they go off

ELISE
Everything I say while I am in tune
will be at a very low volume so
you wont hear any of it Steven
will write it down and repeat it
for you

Specs waits obediently at her side

ELISE (CONTD)

Hold on to each other and stay
focused Youll see things you
dont understand Confusing things
Do not question them or speak in
any way

She turns to Specs

ELISE (CONTD)
Dim the lights please

Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level

Elise closes her eyes concentrating She relaxes her head
as if meditating letting it loll on her shoulders

One of the cameras on the tripod goes off bathing the room
in white light for a split second

Elise inhales and exhales deeply slipping away Soon she
is
very still
Specs nods to Tucker silently then produces an odd looking
device made from GREY CLOTH

It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1 with a cone
shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose The snout

of

the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk coiling

outwards and ending in an old listening device like an
early

version of a microphone

Specs slips two hooks over Elises ears and gently places
the

device over her nose and mouth He then takes a seat next to
her behind Renai who holds Elises hand

Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus
around his neck that holds a flashlight in place

He flicks it on then holds the microphone end of Elises
facemask up to his ear a pencil gripped in the other hand

Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket

Then we hear something lilt through the old microphone It
is Elises muttered whispers Specs begins writing

Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in
cursive

we are calling out to you dalton
Renai grips Joshs hand tightly

SPECS
We are calling out to you Dalton

tell us that you are safe tell us where you are
SPECS (CONTD)

Tell us that you are safe Tell us

where you are

For what seems like an eternity all is quiet and still
until Elises eyelids flutter

Another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone
at Specs ear He writes

whos there
SPECS (CONTD)
Whos there
it is your mother and father we have been
looking for you
SPECS (CONTD)
It is your mother and father We
have been looking for you

Long pause Specs writes again more intense this time

i need help i cant see in here
SPECS (CONTD)

I need helpI cant see in here

follow my voice dalton come back to us
SPECS (CONTD)

Follow my voice Dalton Come back

to us

Another long pause A little too long

Why arent you talking anymore dalton
SPECS (CONTD)

Why arent you talking anymore

Dalton

A long beat Tuckers camera flash goes off again

if they hear me theyll hurt me
SPECS (CONTD)
If they hear me theyll hurt me

who will hurt you
SPECS (CONTD)
Who will hurt you

the man with fire on his face
SPECS (CONTD)
The man with fire on his face

can you find your way back to us
SPECS (CONTD)
Can you find your way back to us

SPECS (CONTD)
There is no way out

Elises head TWITCHES as Specs writes furiously trying to
keep up His pencil finally SNAPS He snatches up another

dalton are you there dalton
An agonizing ocean of silencethen this furious scrawl

HAVESEENYOU IKNOWWHOYOUAREBUTYOUANDTHE
Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes
furiously the scrawl getting out of control Sweat flies
from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down

Suddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and
he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise

With UTTER DREAD he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE
MASK She has taken it off and is panting heavily

The scream continues through the mic audible to
everyonethen peters out

Shocked silence follows

Josh glances over at Daltons bed

He is not in it

Stunned Josh turns back to the table--

--TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM STARING AT HIM

His heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renais as they

camera

grabbing

both turn towards Dalton Their son
Dalton stares at themnot a trace of emotion on his face

Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands
wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS
OWN JAW

Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them spit
flying from his throat his tongue hanging down over his
dislocated jaw

He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at
it Renai Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed
by a hurricane smashing into the wall with crushing power

We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table but
squatting down awkwardly Painfully

He stands up then steps forward As Josh and Renai watch
his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS the tendons stretching

snapping the knee bending in the opposite direction

His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
bending back

Specs is rigid in his chair rooted to the spot notepad
still in hand When he looks up at Dalton the flashlight
under his chin shines in Daltons eyes

Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
force of ten men Specs reels backwards hitting the wall
smashing his head and crumpling like paper

Elise stands to face Dalton The CAMERA FLASH goes off
lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
Daltons face

Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video

Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him
Dalton by the hair

ELISE
Leave this vessel Leave this vessel

Dalton BELLOWS again - a howl so course and ungodly that it
seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself

ELISE (CONTD)
LEAVE THIS VESSEL

Dalton FLIES backwards hitting the corner of the wall and
then CLIMBING IT arcing his body into the far corner of the
ceiling like an expert contortionist

He hisses at them as the CAMERA FLASH fires AGAIN AND AGAIN
showing them split second frames of the red faced CREATURE

ELISE (CONTD)
Leave this earthly body

Dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks
Elise down

The room begins to shake
Books fly
The closet doors burst open

With terror Elise looks over and sees several figures
peering out from within the closet

Two are the women that Specs drew Another is a small man
dressed like a child

They stare out at Elise their eyes glinting in the dark

Elise turns to see Josh The camera flash STROBES repeatedly
and gives us split-second glimpses of an OLD WOMAN dressed
in Victorian era garb - standing directly behind Josh

And then with absolute fear Renai sees the LONG HAIRED MAN

standing over her He SCREAMS at her and pushes her against
the wall licking her She cries out terrified

With the spirit world crashing in around her Elise pulls
herself off the floor and yells again

ELISE (CONTD)
Leave his body

Dalton suddenly SPASMS dropping out of the corner and
hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge

ELISE (CONTD)
The lights

Terrified Specs scrambles over to the corner flicking the
light switch The room is instantly flooded with light

The room has stopped shaking The screaming has stopped

RENAT
Dalton

Renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches
Daltons
limp body

RENAI (CONTD)
Dalton Dalton

She listens for breathing His chest moves He is still
breathing She holds him and cries More desperate than
ever

INT KITCHEN NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Tucker Specs and Elise convene in the kitchen slumped
amongst the boxes for the tech gear All are in shock

SPECS
I feel like a mountain climber
whos been waiting his whole life
to climb Everest and now that Im
standing on the summit I dont
know what to do with myself

TUCKER
Ill tell you what we do with
ourselves We make a short list of
our preferred media outlets thats
what

He holds up his video camera

TUCKER (CONTD)
Watch this

He hits play on a monitor that his video camera is cabled
to

Chaotic images of Dalton from the previous scene SPIT to
life
BEHIND DALTON we can just make out the blurry image of the

RED-FACED DEMON Puppeteering Dalton from behind
Controlling

his limbs like a human marionette

SPECS
Oh my God

TUCKER
After all the years weve been
dining out on morsels like a faucet
that turns itself on and offwe
finally have some empirical
evidence of the real thing Proof

He hits pause on the video freeze-framing the hellish
image

ELISE
Proof Proof of what Nine tenths
of the world believes that when you
die your soul ascends to sit with
God Would you be telling them
something they didnt already know

TUCKER
That is so not the point This is not
about religion Here we have
irrefutable evidence of a paranormal
experience Our job is to share it

ELISE
No our job is not to alert the press
and prove the existence of the
“paranormal as you call it Im not
out to prove anything Ive known
there was a higher plane ever since I
was a little girl and I could play
hopscotch with people whose names
were inscribed on tombstones What
you call paranormal is a fact of life
for me

(BEAT)
Our job is to help people The
least we can do is spare them the
indignity of Sixty Minutes

She snatches his camera away from him and stands up

TUCKER

Elise

Yeah until they get their book
dealthen youll wish youd listened

ELISE
No I wont Tucker Ill just be
proud of you You two stared down
something that would crush most
mortals tonight and you stood tall

They manage a smile

SPECS
So what do we do now

ELISE
We answer the door

SPECS
What do you mean

There is a knock at the front door

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Josh sits with Renais head in his lap She is too
traumatized to speak Rain dribbles down the window pane

Josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door Elise
shuffles over to answer it

She opens the door to reveal Lorraine wet from the

Elise steps aside and Lorraine walks in gravely sedate

JOSH
Momwhat are you doing here

ELISE
I asked your mother to come over I
called her immediately afterthe
session I told her to hurry over

JOSH
Why

Lorraines usual strong will has evaporated She looks to

ELISE
There is something we must talk
about Sit down Lorraine

Lorraine follows orders easing onto the sofa Eyes down
Thunder growls in the distance

ELISE (CONTD)
Go on Tell him

JOSH
Tell me what

Lorraine swallows and starts talking

LORRAINE
The reasonI knew to call Elise
in this situationthe reason I
know her so wellis because I
called her myself once Years ago

She looks up at Josh

LORRAINE (CONTD)
To help you Josh

JOSH
What are you talking about

Lorraine cant go on Elise steps in

ELISE
Its no accident that your son is
such a gifted traveller The
ability was handed down to him

By his father

FLASHCUT TO

INT DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
We have returned to the opening scene

We are looking down on a sleeping child Chest rising and
falling with each breath

This is JOSH as a child
We move away from him exploring the dark room

FLASHCUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT

Tucker and Specs enter the room lingering at the back

JOSH
NoIve neverdone that before

LORRAINE
When you were about eightyou
suffered night terrors Awful fits
of pure fear You were terrified of
an old woman who you said would
come to visit you at night

FLASHCUT TO

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Again we return to the opening scenefloating down a long
hallway

A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach
Someone is standing in front of it

The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away We
follow it tentative Turning a corner we see the figure
Standing in a doorway

Now we can make out the edges of the figure It is an old
woman Hair in a Victorian bun A corseted dress

IT IS THE SAME OLD WOMAN THAT ELISE SAW

OLD WOMAN
Let me in

FLASHCUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Lorraine closes her eyes struggling to go on
time

visible

LORRAINE
I dismissed your stories Told you
to grow up

(BEAT)
Then I saw her for myself

She looks to Elise who nods

Hand trembling Lorraine retrieves a packet from within her
coat The paper is yellowing Faded Soaked from the rain

Lorraine hands the packet to Josh who is dumbfounded

Renai peers over Joshs shoulder at a Polaroid of a boy
about nine years old sitting on a couch Early 70s period

It is a Young Josh Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A
FIGURE

Josh runs his finger over the shadow His heart rate speeds
up An old memory is coming back to him

LORRAINE (CONTD)
At first I thought it was a camera

problem Then I saw her again

Josh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of
Josh as a youngster This time he stands in an old kitchen

Once again there is a figure behind him - clearer this
but still hidden in silhouette A step closer to Josh
Josh flips to the next picture A BLACK AND WHITE shot of

himself as a young boy lying in bed

With dread Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD
WOMAN crouching beside his bed Staring at him

LORRAINE (CONTD)
In each photo she got closer and

closer to you

Josh flips to the next picture - in this one Young Josh is
standing by a car

Behind him the details of the Old Womans dress are

Her arm is extendedreaching out for Joshs neck
Renais hand flies to her mouth

LORRAINE (CONTD)
Finally I was so scared I called
Elise

Sweat pours down Joshs brow

He lets the photographs flutter from his fingers backing
away Fragments of memories rock his entire body

JOSH
I dontI dont remember any of
this

ELISE
Youve blocked it out

(BEAT)

But in the back of your mind
youre still afraid of having your
picture taken arent you

Josh grabs the wall weak at the knees

LORRAINE
Ive kept the photos hidden ever
since thenuntil tonight

ELISE
I advised Lorraine to hide them To
stop taking your picture And to
let you forget

JOSH
Who is she

ELISE
A parasite She befriended your
astral body then drew you out into
The Further just as Dalton has
been drawn out

(MORE)

ELISE (CONTD)
But she deceived you All she
wanted was an empty vessel A
physical body Yours

LORRAINE
Im sorry Josh
ELISE
I didnt want to make you remember
thisI only do it for the sake of
your son

A quiet descends over them

ELISE (CONTD)
Your son is out there

(BEAT)
And you are the only one who can
bring him back

Josh looks up at her

JOSH
How long do we have beforethat
thingtakes him over completely

All eyes are on Elise

ELISE
If you cannot reach him tonight
then he is gone forever

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The lights have been dimmed Josh sits on a single person
lounge chair

Elise sits opposite him

Tucker and Specs set up around her fixing their cameras in

place Renai leans forward on the couch opposite chewing
her

nails to the quick Lorraine is next to her

ELISE
Remember who you are and why you
are traveling Keep one foot in
this world

(BEAT)
Are you ready

Josh nods Renai hugs him and they hold onto it She
whispers

to him staring into his eyes

RENAI
I want you to know somethingyou
have never been less than good
enough for me Youve always been
perfect for me Youre my best
friendmy soulmate I love you so
much

JOSH
I love you too I have since the
first time you looked at me I
dont exist without you

Elise drifts over to the piano lifting the METRONOME from
it

She sets it down in front of Josh freeing the weighted
swing-
arm so it moves back and forth

TICKTICKTICK

ELISE
Close your eyes Joshand relax
Breathe deeply Let all life around you
fade out into the backgrounduntil
the only thing you can hear is the
ticking of the metronome

We PUSH IN on Josh inhaling and exhaling
TICKTICKTICK

ELISE (CONTD)
Focus on a spot in the center of
your forehead Feel that spot
getting further away as you drift
off to sleep

We are now in an ECU of Josh TICKTICKTICK

ELISE (CONTD)
I want you to relax your physical
body and let the astral body gain
strengthfeel it rising out of
your chest

Renai watches literally and figuratively on the edge of her
seat Tucker and Specs take notes from the corner

Josh breathes deeply Eyes shut tightly

ELISE (CONTD)
Detach yourself
chair

Joshs eyes open suddenly and he stands up frustrated
marching across the living room

JOSH
This is uselessI have no idea
what Im doing and you just
suddenly expect me to

He turns around and stops dead His words trail off
HE IS LOOKING AT HIMSELF

He sees his own body sitting in the armchair eyes closed
Elise is sitting opposite with her back to the Josh who is
now standing

The living room is exactly as it was - only Renai Lorraine
Tucker and Specs have disappeared They are nowhere to be
seen

Stunned into mute shock Josh stares at his own body in the
armchair

Slowly Elise turns her head away from the Josh in the
staring eerily into the standing Joshs eyes
She can see him

ELISE

(SOFTLY)
Now you are free

(BEAT)
Keep your guide and a steady
strideand into The Further you

go

She turns back to the Josh in the chair The room seems to
have darkened even more somehow

Josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it
yawns outwards eventually swallowed by complete blackness

He is not in another world He is in his own house
NOTE - The following scenes are not going to be movie

quiet They will be inhumanly quiet There will no score
Only sound scape This is another world and should feel so
does

desolate

Josh moves forward gliding down the hall slowly He looks
down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the
ground

He is floating

He moves into the darkness of the hallpast the bedroom

doors and closet doors

As he floats past he scans every darkened corner for the
slightest trace of movement
He reaches the front door He moves towards it and as he

it OPENS

EXT THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY BUT DARK

His street beckons beyond the door

Josh floats across his lawn

There are no people or cars on the streetit is as

as a post-apocalyptic wasteland
A
TOTAL
ABSENCE
OF
LIFE

Some lights flicker from within the houses but no movement
or signs of human forms Only mist

Josh floats an inch above the road moving down the street
One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon
or city scape hereJoshs immediate surroundings are
visible for about one hundred yards or soanything beyond
that in any direction fades into blackness As if someone
were shining a giant spotlight down on him

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD

Renai watches Josh He is completely stillin a trance

His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions
underneath
ELISE
Hes in
EXT THE FURTHER - NIGHT
Josh keeps moving his fear registering even in this world
He looks down at his feet

He is frustrated that he cant move any faster He
concentrates with fierce intensity--

--and then watches as his feet touch the ground

He is walking

He starts to move faster gaining control of his movement

JOSH
Dalton

The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were
inside a soundproof recording studio There are no walls or

angles for it to bounce off

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton Where are you

For a long time there is nothing

then he sees it

A figureshrouded in shadow Standing on the street corner
with his back to Josh

Josh moves towards the figure

Closer Closer

The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back
Josh glances around the corner There is nobody there

He continues down the street He sees a little girl Far in

the distance but close enough to focus on She stands and
stares
it

open

then turns and walks away Gonelike an apparition
He looks to his right and sees--

--A SHADOW

Behind a curtain in one of the windows back lit by candle
light As with the others the shadow turns away and
disappears

Josh walks towards the front door of the house He reaches

and turns the handle

INT HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
A long corridor beckons As with all of this world it is

dark here

Josh walks into the corridor looking to his left and right
into empty rooms Living rooms and bedrooms Devoid of life

The colors are mutedthe palate drained Only REDS and
BLACKS pop out Blood and darkness

Josh keeps moving down the corridor

Up ahead he sees a figure run past the top of the hall
ignoring Josh

He presses forward following the figure

JOSH
Dalton

He glances into an empty kitchen Food rots on the table

His footsteps have no sound as he continues on

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton

He passes a door that is partly open He pushes it wide

INT SMALL ROOM THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
His

The room is small and empty A strange roomlike a stage

A figure is sitting in the corner facing the wall like a
child being punished at school

Josh steps closer cautious Takes another step

JOSH
Where is Dalton

He steps closer yet again
His hand reaches out to touch the figures back
-his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder

Soft laughter behind him Josh glances back to look for the
source

When he turns back the FIGURE IS GONE

He wheels around seeing the small-statured figure of the
DWARF that Renai encountered stepping through the door of
the room

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS

Josh sidles back into the corridor His pace is sluggish
dream-like

Frustrated he stops Then turns to his left
SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE A MAN
The man is not looking at himonly standing very close

neck lolls on his shouldersaround and around He seems
stuck on a loop He is dressed in a fifties era suit

JOSH
Do you know where Dalton is

The man doesnt acknowledge him

MAN
Why do I have to put up with you
What a tramp You call this a home
I work all day for this

He marches away leaving Josh standing alone
stairs

to

middle

Josh keeps going whirling around He reaches a set of
The stairs descend into darkness
Josh squints into the dark afraid

JOSH
Dalton Where are you

The low rumble of this place is the only reply Josh turns
walk away A distant voice stops him

DALTON (0S)
Dad

Josh SNAPS back

The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of
the stairs

Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it

INT HALLWAY THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
The core of a rotten apple The bowels of hell
Drenched in shadow Josh fumbles forward into yet another

corridor of this labyrinth

He realizes he knows where he is He is in his OLD HOUSE An
alternate world version of it

The lighting is different - its darker There are no signs
of life Water drips somewhere

Josh stumbles forward seeing an open door

INT LIVING ROOM THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room
There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman a

aged man and a young girl They are all FROZEN standing in
place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life
an

floor

Her

possible

The woman is in the middle of ironing The man is sitting in
arm chair reading a newspaper The girl is lying on the

The whole scene looks like a macabre “Leave It To Beaver
tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time

Josh steps closer to the mother

-hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK
body moves slightly She is not frozen - merely playing
statues Like a street performer keeping as still as

Josh turns to the father He is the same His hand shakes
struggling to hold the newspaper in place

He backs away from them truly creeped out His back hits a
window and he turns peering through the glass down at the

street below

A figure hidden in silhouette is gazing up at him

INT KITCHEN THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS

Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room A weathered
door is adjacent to the kitchen

The door is ajar
Through it Josh can see somebodies leg

Josh approaches the door prodding it open gently with his
finger

It is a bedroom A tattered cot sits against the wall A
YOUNG MAN sits on the cot holding a rifle Like the
others he is trying to be completely still as if on pause

He is having more trouble than the family trembling
slightly

JOSH
Im looking for my son Dalton

The boy does not look up Does not move
in

Josh retreats scanning the kitchen There are soiled pots

the sink Rotting food but no bugs Josh turns the faucet
but no water comes forth

When he turns back the YOUNG MAN is gone No longer in his
bedroom

Josh glances back at the living room

The Young Man is now standing inside the living room
Again he is frozen Holding his rifle Looking down at his
family who are now splayed out on the carpet soaked in
BLOOD

Each of them has a bullet hole in their head

Repulsed Josh tip-toes past them He looks down at the
mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest

She blinksstill playing dead

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
More corridors disappearing into darkness

Josh wrenches his hair in frustration He boils over
screaming at the top of his lungs

JOSH
DALTON WHERE ARE YOU

His cry recedes into nothingness

DALTON (0S)
Dad

He heard that Excited he spins around trying to determine
where it came from

As he does he sees that the entire dead family is now
gathered at the door to the living room Watching him

He summons all his strength and starts running backing away

from them

He drives himself to move faster and faster
JOSH
DALTON

DALTON (0S)
Dadhelp me

JOSH
DALTON

A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway

It is the LONG HAIRED MAN IN THE GREY JACKET The man who
terrorized Renai

LONG HAIRED MAN
I hear you

He approaches

LONG HAIRED MAN (CONTD)
I hear you but you dont know what
youve done

He licks his lips

LONG HAIRED MAN (CONTD)
There is a place that you cant go
to and this is that place

He is only a few yards from Josh now He SCREAMS with
awesome
power his spit flying

LONG HAIRED MAN (CONTD)

YOU MADE A MISTAKE IM GOING TO
MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING
FOR YOU IM GOING TO RIP YOU APART
YOU CUNT

He CHARGES at Josh screaming with hellfire fury

Josh recoils falling onto the floor screaming

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD

Joshs body JOLTS in the chair and he makes a noise
somewhere
between a scream and a moan

RENAI
Whats happening to him
Elise leans in attempting to communicate with Josh

ELISE
Youre stronger then they are
Josh You are a living soul

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER

Josh struggles The Long Haired Man attacks him viciously

Then something changes in Josh - he gets angry

JOSH
Getoffme

He shoves the Long Haired Man back pounding into him with
the strength of TEN MEN

JOSH (CONTD)
Get away from me Leave now

Frightened the Long Haired Man retreats backing away until
he is swallowed up by the blackness

JOSH (CONTD)
Dalton

DALTON (0S)
(STILL DISTANT)
Im here

Josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this Escher-
like maze of passageways

JOSH
Dalton

DALTON (0S)

Here

INT BALLROOM THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS

From darkness into baroque extravagance

Josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected

opulenceas if a palace had been stormed the occupants
murdered and the place left to rot
rest

into

He

Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes the
having rotted way
Mirrors line the walls their surface too clouded to see

JOSH
Dalton

He weaves between pillars finally coming across a figure
slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog

It is Dalton

Josh runs to him His foot is chained to a PIPE behind him
the clamp binding his right ankle He looks pale and sick

looks like one of them

JOSH (CONTD)
Im taking you back

He sees that Dalton is terrified Looking over Joshs
shoulder

JOSH (CONTD)
What is it

He glances back spotting an open door at the end of the
ballroom light spilling from within it

There is somebody inside

INT MAKE-UP ROOM THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS

A grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold-rimmed
mirror at a baroque powder table

It is the RED-FACED creature seen by Elise

The creature daubs RED LIPSTICK onto its face arching
forward glaring into the mirror caking the make-up on

The room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDRENS
TOYS - teddy bears stuffed animals dolls (including one
white-faced black-haired doll we recognize) They are
scattered about like bones collecting dust in the shadows
Suddenly the creature stops what it is doing It sees
something in the mirror

What it sees is Josh

INT BALLROOM THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS

With horror Josh watches as the Red-Faced Man stands up and
staggers to the door peering through the crack at him

Josh wrestles to free Daltons leg from the chain No good

Behind them the Red Faced Man opens the door A rage unknown
to humans is building up inside the creature He hisses

DALTON
Help me dadtake this off me

The creature steps closer Taking his time Drool seeping
from his mouth with each drunken wayward lope

JOSH
Youre not really here Youre
asleep in your bed in our home
Just stand up

DALTON
Hes going to hurt me again

JOSH
This isnt real You can do this

DALTON
Hes coming
JOSH
Just stand up
Dalton does - and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer

attached to his foot

The Red Faced Man ROARS and the power of his breath sends
them FLYING BACK

RED-FACED MAN
Thisissssssreal

Josh smashes his head on a pillar blood leaking from his
head The power of this demon far outweighs the others

RED-FACED MAN (CONTD)
Thatissssmyboy

Josh scrambles to his feet and snatches up Dalton carrying

him to the door as the Red Faced Man pursues

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
Josh convulses in the chair choking
RENAI

Help him

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER
Josh surges down a corridor carrying Dalton

The Red-Faced Man hobbles up behind them his rasping wheeze
growing in volume

RED-FACED MAN
Youre here now With ussss

Josh stampedes through the front door of the house - but
instead of the street he is facing another corridor

They spill into the second corridor running again racing
past rows and rows of doors

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
Josh twitches in his chair sweat beading on his forehead

JOSH
(MOANING)
-omeonnnnn

Elise paces in front of him

ELISE
Theyve made contact I know it
Hes found your son

RENAI
What happens now

ELISE
We need them to come back We need
him to find us
Tuckers equipment begins to shake on the table The hanging
light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling

A force is building in the room

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER

As Josh and Dalton streak down the corridor each door opens
and a different figure staggers out

Grotesque figuresthe solemn dead Pale skin hollow eyes
Their dead eyes drill into Joshs soul

They want what he has - life

They begin running - chasing Josh Dozens of them
Josh stops seeing that the corridor seemingly has NO END
yells in frustration

JOSH

I want to get out
INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
Joshs body SHUDDERS the cry escaping his lips

JOSH

The room trembles again Elise looks to Renai

call from another world
RENAI (VO)

The voice seems to come from behind the door in front of
Josh He shoves it open--
INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
Renai glares at Joshs eyelidsas if he can see her
them

RENAI
Follow my voice Come back to us

The room stops trembling All is very still

For a moment it is as if time has stopped Nuclear silence
Thena drawer slides open in the corner of the room

Lorraine and Renai gasp at this supernatural interruption

Specs clambers to his feet approaching the drawer It

contains a note pad and nothing else

He reaches out to close itand then JOLTS as a HAND

out from within it

He FLAILS backwards in fright watching as the hand wrenches
a mop of hair into view

A FULL GROWN BODY BEGINS TO CLAW its way out of the drawer

INT DALTONS BEDROOM NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
Drawers in Daltons room slide open in unison Then
The closet BURSTS open

Pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the
different doors undulating out of impossibly small spaces
Forced

and falling onto the floor like limbless insects

Cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are
slithering through the fissures

INT KITCHEN NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME

More doors shoot open - cabinets closets the pantry

by unseen hands

More hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world

INT CORRIDOR THE FURTHER
Josh is exhausted pushing himself to the limits

He hears the voice again - distant and small An echo

RENAI (VO)
Find us

Josh follows the voice to a door
He staggers towards it still supporting Dalton He slams

door open falling through it into--

INT BASEMENT LAMBERT HOME THE FURTHER
-- the empty basement

He is in the basement of his old house The wooden steps
beckon above him

Renais voice cries out from behind the door at the top of
the stairs

RENAI (VO)
Hurry Come back to us

DALTON
Put me down I can run

Josh sets Dalton down who scampers up the stairs Josh is
about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face

of

the

THE OLD WOMAN

She leers at Josh through the window of the basement her
visage spookily flecked in candlelight

Josh is transfixed

DALTON (CONTD)
Come on dad Come on

JOSH
Go Im right behind you

Dalton charges ahead as Josh glares back at this face from
his past

JOSH (CONTD)
Youwhat do you want from me

The old womans eerily unblinking gaze cuts through Josh A
long dormant rage BOILS OVER inside him He approaches the
window vomiting fury at her
JOSH (CONTD)

Get the fuck away from me Im not

scared of you just leave me alone

Get away from me

The old womans lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard
molars A smile to buckle the steeliest nerve

She raises a lit candle to her lips

She snuffs out the plume with a single puffplunging the
basement into darkness

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME

Specs staggers back as the skeletal figures emerging from

cabinets ambulate into the living room surrounding Josh

INT BASEMENT LAMBERT HOME THE FURTHER

In another POV shot we SURGE up the basement stairs

INT CORRIDOR NEW HOUSE THE FURTHER
Our POV is only a few yards from Daltons bedroom door

The Red-Faced Man appears at the opposite end of the hall

The closest entity reaches out with gnarled fingers and is
almost touching Josh--

He reaches into his jacket taking out the eerie photos
Lorraine gave him of himself as a child

JOSH (CONTD)

Ill start by giving these back

As he hands them to Elise she sees with fear that his hand
is withered and wrinkled

Like the hand of an eighty year old woman

Shocked she looks up at his face

JOSH (CONTD)
Whats wrong

Elise stands She looks haunted Her eyes wide and unnerved

ELISE

She turns away reaching for something

JOSH
Whats the matter Elise

She spins around and lifts Tuckers camera up to her face
aiming it at him She depresses the trigger and takes a

of him bathing the whole corridor in white light
Josh recoils back in shock Elise lowers the camera She is
terrified Josh suddenly LUNGES at her slapping the camera
out of her hands

He SLAMS her against the wall his hands around her throat

Elise chokes in terror terrified of him

JOSH (CONTD)
You of all people You know Why
would you do that to me when you
know what you know You bitch

He abruptly stops attacking her staggering backwards
examining his hands as if he cant believe what hes done
Seething with fury Panting

Elise collapses catching her breath

Josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away
heading down the corridor

Sswallowed up by the darkness

Each room is empty Josh is nowhere to be found

INT LIVING ROOM NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
Elise stares at Tuckers camera in a state of catatonic
Renai backs into the room her own fear rising in her gut

She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders

RENAI
Elise what happened Youre
scaring me tell me where Josh is
Elise finally looks up at her Seeing the expert so afraid
unnerves Renai When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs
you know the lion is vicious

Elise opens her mouth to speakbut nothing comes out

Instead she simply holds up the camera showing Renai the
digital display of the photo she took

We do not see it
We simply see the look of horror on Renais face

--and in that split second Josh is replaced by the Old
Woman

Elise lowers the camera horrified For a beat the Old

just glares at her
her

as

THROUGH

then she CHARGES at Elise arms outstretched wrapping
white hands around the soft flesh of Elises throat
Elise CHOKES eyes bulging spittle flying from her mouth
the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax

of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
nails have CUT IN to the flesh

The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
Elises pain

She lets Elise go letting her drop to the floor

The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor Something
has caught her attention A distant scream

INT BATHROOM NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

The door groans open a blade of light penetrating pitch
black darkness

The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the

bathroom She steps up to the mirror then reaches into her
tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle

She lights the candle with a match holding it beneath her
chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror

Instead of seeing her own reflection though she sees

the mirror as if it were a window

In it she can see the BASEMENT of the Lamberts previous
residence

Josh bursts into the basement carrying Dalton

DALTON
Put me down I can run

Josh sets Dalton down who scampers up the stairs
We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in

mirror
Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar
face He looks at the Old Womanseeing her through the
window

DALTON (CONTD)
Come on dad Come on

JOSH
Go Im right behind you

Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman

JOSH (CONTD)
Youwhat do you want from me

He approaches the mirror WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman
past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL emerging on
the other side in--

INT BASEMENT LAMBERT HOME INSIDE THE FURTHER

--the basement

Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through
what he thinks is a window THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES He is
now in The Further and she is in our world

JOSH

not scared of you just leave me

alone Get away from me
We KEEP CIRCLING wiping past Joshs back and completing a
360 degree turn THROUGH THE WALL and back into--

INT BATHROOM NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

--our world

The Old Woman smiles at Joshs rage She finds it amusing
With an eerily unblinking gaze she snuffs out the plume of
flame with a single puff of breathplunging the bathroom

into darkness

and snuffing out Josh forever
and ever

FADE OUT
