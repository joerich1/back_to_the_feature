Over opening credits are images and highlights from the
Little League World Series over the past fifty years

Transition into ABC’s coverage of the 1973 Series The
graphics clothes and hair styles suggest the era

INT ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH BRENT MUSBURGER and REGGIE JACKSON wear the trademark ABC
jackets The game can be seen through the window behind them

BRENT MUSBURGER
Well it’s been one heck of a ball
game here in Williamsport But the
Firecrackers of Flint Michigan
have all but manhandled--or should
I say “boy-handled”--these kids
from Panama Just one out stands
between this team and the title of
1973 Little League World Champions
Which will be due in big part to
the arm of pitcher Danny Turner

REGGIE JACKSON
You said it Brent I mean wow
I’m the reigning AL MVP Reggie
Jackson and even Id hate to face
Danny’s knuckle curve ball a
wicked pitch that comes in slow
then drops and curves He’s got
future big leaguer written all
over him

EXT WILLIAMSPORT BALLFIELD - PITCHER’S MOUND - CONTINUOUS
Thirteen year old Danny winds up
SERIES OF SHOTS - strike one strike two strike three
BRENT MUSBURGER (VO)
And that’s it The Firecrackers
have done it
A chubby catcher rushes to pick up Danny in celebration
BRENT MUSBURGER (VO)
Danny’s teammates are lifting him
up on to their shoulders
REGGIE JACKSON (VO)

Soak it up Flint’s biggest
celebrity You’re only young once
Close on young Danny’s face which transitions into the face
of 52 YEAR OLD DANNY a big kid He wears the same baseball
cap - both are scruffy and a little worse for the wear

EXT WILLIAMSPORT BALLFIELD - PRESENT DAY
Danny is on TV which he doesn’t realize

BRENT MUSBURGER (VO)
Now if that face looks familiar
it’s because it belongs to the kid
who threw one of the finest games
in Little League history

Danny is on a hill overlooking the field Below players are
warming up As is tradition little kids slide down this hill
on cardboard Danny does it headfirst tumbling at the end
into a group of kids wiping them out like bowling pins

INT ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Brent and Reggie (oddly looking just about the same) watch
Danny on their monitor

BRENT MUSBURGER
Looks like you can take the boy out
of the game but you can’t take the
game out of the boy In addition to
his records Danny has added
something else to his Little League
legacy - his son Daniel Turner

Through the glass behind them down on the field pitcher
DANIEL is warming up He looks too serious for a 12-year-old
Fans of all ages crowd the nearby fence for autographs

REGGIE JACKSON
A ruthless pitcher with his
father’s same knuckle curve

BRENT MUSBURGER
Thank you hall-of-famer Reggie
Jackson

EXT BALLPARK - FIELD LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Danny pushes his way through the crowd by the fence trying
to make his way on to the field

DANNY
(to whoever will listen)
Yes I’m him Excuse me Oh thanks
for remembering Excuse me gotta
get through No autographs folks
(MORE )
DANNY (contd)
Sorry I’m not an asshole just
busy Alright maybe one

ANNOUNCER (0C)
And starting pitcher for the Flint
Firecrackers Daniel Turner

DANNY
Yeah Let’s go hot rod Show them
what you’re made of Me

(to fan next to him)
That’s my son

FAN
No really

At the gate Danny is stopped by a hulking SECURITY GUARD

SECURITY GUARD
You got some ID

DANNY
I think this should cover it

Danny shows his 1973 Little League championship ring
Security Guard opens the gate and Danny walks through

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry I questioned you champ

Danny turns around takes off his custom made 1973 champ’s
satin jacket and tosses it to the Security Guard

SECURITY GUARD
What Are you friggin’ kidding me
This is priceless one of a kind
Youre just like Mean Joe Green

Danny walks back over

DANNY
Yeah um look I just got caught
up in the moment there I really
need that back

Security Guard doesn’t easily let go but Danny wrestles it
back from him

DANNY
Thank you

Danny walks past kid players stretching and warming up He
dispenses advice to them as he goes
DANNY
Hey Scooter remember to shift left
for that big number forty four
Andy keep your elbow up on your
swing alright buddy Remember
boys losing is for losers

Danny makes over to his son Daniel

DANNY
How’s the arm son

DANIEL
From twenty minutes ago when you
asked it’s great Hey Dad can I
ask you something

DANNY
Of course Wow doesn’t it smell
great down here

DANIEL
Should I grow a mustache

DANNY
Yes No-- What Grow a mustache
Youre about to pitch the biggest
game of your career and you’re
talking about mustaches

DANIEL
Biggest game of my career Dad
this is the end of my career I’m
gonna throw these guys a beatin’
and then it’s on to finding a nice
girl like you did So the
mustache ladies dig ‘em right

RICK
Daniel is this man bothering you
Oh Danny it’s you Sorry I
mistook you for a drifter You know
it’s only players and coaches on
the field

DANNY
Good call Coach Rick I know it
puts you in a weird spot hassling
parents So just give me the word
and I’11 kick them out

Danny puts back on his Little League Champion jacket

COACH RICK cocky and mustached also around 50 walks up
DANNY
Just found out this was priceless
Who knew But hey enough about all
my accomplishments Pretty soon
here you’ll finally be a Little
League champ as well Now you may
not think winning as a coach is as
good--

RICK
Yes actually I think it is

DANNY
(laughs then)
Oh you’re serious Yes yes it is
just as good Well go get ‘em

INT ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
Back with Brent and Reggie

BRENT MUSBURGER
Deja vu Seems like only forty
years ago that these kids had
Farrah Fawcett on their wall
Stevie Wonder on their eight-track
and feelings they couldn’t quite
describe in their nether region

REGGIE JACKSON
Had me up until that

BRENT MUSBURGER
And a hot shot from Flint Michigan
took his team to the big dance
Reggie the history of Flint
please

REGGIE JACKSON
Well it’s certainly had its share
of great Firecracker teams Of
course the 1973 bunch won it all
But several teams have come oh so
close most notably the year right
before The 72 Firecrackers made
it here to the Series only to be
humiliated by the Panamanians in
the first round They returned the
following year for revenge It was
virtually the same team only with
added pitching phenom Danny Turner

BRENT MUSBURGER
If I’m not mistaken the pitcher
who was replaced by Danny is here
today

REGGIE JACKSON
That’s right Brent That
unfortunate kid is Firecrackers’
coach Rick Wannamaker You can bet
he wants some redemption

Coach Rick is now on their monitor

BRENT MUSBURGER
Oh baby he can just taste it

EXT BALLFIELD - CONTINUOUS

Coach Rick tries to coolly spit like a ball player but ends
up spitting down his chin and on himself He looks around and
tries to wipe it off before anyone notices

EXT BALLFIELD - STANDS - DAY

Danny walks through a sea of Korean fans He finds his seat
by his buddy T-BONE MALONE an affable big guy

DANNY
I gotta tell you T-Bone I’m
nervous

T-BONE
More nervous than when we were
here

A baseball vender goes by but he’s speaking Korean

DANNY
No come on I knew we’d crush the
Panamanians

Instead of hot dogs sushi is being passed down the row

T-BONE
Really Because as I recall your
first pitch went into the dirt and
your second into the stands

Koreans are passing money back down the row - Korean money
DANNY

Yeah but where did the next three
pitches go

The two have a little ritual - Danny mock throws T-Bone mock
catches then they both signal “out”

DANNY (CONTD)
Okay so I’m not as much nervous
as I am concerned Daniel is down
there talking about growing a
mustache

T-BONE
A mustache is a lot of
responsibility Never had the
mustache talk with my kids

DANNY
You have three girls

T-BONE
But I also have a wife who
bleaches I just had the whole make-
up argument with my youngest Be
glad he’s not into that

DANNY
Why are they trying to grow up so
damn fast I mean there’s a time
to be a kid and there’s a time to
be an adult

T-BONE
True enough Where’s Vicki

DANNY
She’s sitting with the Americans
She says I’m too much of a kid

They take off their shirts revealing painted bodies

DANNY
And that I’m not a responsible
parent or husband and that I need
to commit as much time to family as
I do building forts fantasy
sports and reliving my glory days
with my loser friends

T-BONE
Loser Do you think she meant me

DANNY
Not a chance We’re winners
They stand up to cheer On their fronts “Fire” and
“Crackers” On their backs “Death to” and “Kim Jong-il” To
the guys’ surprise Korean fans cheer at the sight of this

T-BONE
Reverse psychology Damn they’re
good

A KOREAN MAN with perfect English leans over

KOREAN MAN
Were from South Korea you
assholes

SERIES OF SHOTS - Daniel almost single-handedly beating the
Korean team

BACK IN THE STANDS - LATER

T-BONE
That pitch is a thing of a beauty
Wish I could pass on my wealth of
baseball knowledge to the next
generation Maybe I’1l write a
book

DANNY
That would mean you’d actually have
to write a book

T-BONE
Yeah you’re right Maybe I’1l
record an audio book instead

Daniel throws a final strike His teammates mob the field
Danny and T-Bone jump and hug each other

BRENT MUSBURGER (VO)
That’s it folks The Flint
Firecrackers are once again Little
League Champs

DANNY
Excuse us South Koreans

Danny heads down to the field
EXT BALLFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Brent Musburger with a camera crew finds Daniel The rest of
his team is still in a dog pile
BRENT MUSBURGER
There he is Congratulations
Daniel I don’t know if there’s
anybody who can stand in there and
hit that knuckle curve

DANIEL
Yeah one person My dad He’s the
one who taught me how to throw it

As if on cue Danny shows up

BRENT MUSBURGER
Credit where credit is due Danny
Turner back on the biggest stage
in Little League ball

DANNY
Thanks Brent But Daniel deserves
the credit here Four words - work
ethic work ethic

BRENT MUSBURGER
I can’t help but imagine what it’d
have been like if your two teams
faced off It would be like a lion
fighting a shark

DANNY
Yeah I mean I guess

BRENT MUSBURGER
Or the Abominable Snowman taking on
Big Foot No I got it A tornado
versus an earthquake Am I right

DANIEL
Well Brent wed have certainly
had our hands full Back in the
day that is

Daniel’s final comment surprises Danny

DANNY
Right son But we--

Danny is interrupted by the kids carrying by Coach Rick on
their shoulders then pouring Gatorade on him

INT PIZZA PLACE - LATER

Through the window the bus is parked outside with a banner
and shoe-polished windows that read “BEST EVER”

The players toast with sodas and slices of pizza They’re
acting like kids - blowing bubbles in drinks putting straws
in their mouths like fangs Danny looks like he’s over it

T-Bone and Danny take it all in

T-BONE
This is what it’s all about eh
buddy

DANNY
To the victors go the spoils of
war

PHIL a player’s dad comes up to the guys

PHIL
Hey T-Bone Danny Congrats Pretty
awesome the boys getting a
championship ring of their own

DANNY
It sure is
(seriously)
But heavy is the hand that wears
the ring Phil Know what I mean

PHIL
No not really

On a big screen ESPN’s SportsCenter is playing highlights
from the game Coach Rick shushes everybody to watch They
cheer at anchor STUART SCOTT’s mention of the team

ON TV - SPORTSCENTER

STUART SCOTT
No doubt about it this is the best
team of 2010 But the debate batted
around here all day is who’s
better the Champion 1973
Firecrackers or the new Champs
Like Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron
different era different game
Guess we’ll never know

Rick follows up

RICK
Oh I think we know Who’s the best

CROWD
We are

T-BONE
(to Danny)
Guess our reign is over I’m gonna
go drown my sorrows Or to be

more accurate stuff my sorrows

T-Bone walks away Danny watches Coach Rick get handshakes
and pats on the back Rick then approaches VICKI 40’s an
attractive down-to-Earth mom

RICK
Thank you for your cheering today
Vicki I couldn’t have done it
without you

VICKI
You mean “we” You said “I”

RICK
Well I meant the collective “I”

Danny approaches the two of them

DANNY
Coach Rick there’s a debate over
there about who should play you in
a Firecrackers movie I say Hilary
Swank

RICK
Get serious She doesn’t have the
range Besides I should play
myself of course Excuse me

Rick heads off to end the “debate”

DANNY
That guy is my Lex Luthor

VICKI
Making you Superman I think he’d
be more like your Eddie Haskell
Quite a game huh Your heckling go
over well

Danny says something in Korean

DANNY
I just insulted your family’s
appliances which in my book
doesn’t go over the line but just
enough to get in your head

An uncomfortable beat of neither knowing what to say
DANNY
Okay I know you’re still unhappy
with me

VICKI
True but I’m not ruining Daniel’s
night talking aboutour stuff

DANNY
Oh good I hate talking about our
stuff

VICKI

Don’t tell Daniel but in a way
I’m glad the season is over So at
some point soon you and I can work
on us We can’t just keep putting
our issues on hold and--

DANNY
Thought you didn’t want to talk
about this

VICKI
(louder )
And come back to them when it’s
convenient It’s never convenient

A family at the next table looks over

DANNY

(to table)
Our hotel in relation to the
stadium Not very convenient

(to Vicki)
I know that It’s just I’ve been
busy I had to come here early to
scout out the competition And
before that T-Bone and I were ona
serious mission to master all the
songs on Rock Band You’ll be happy
to know it kicked our ass

Daniel walks up

DANNY
Daniel Turner you just won the
Little League World Series What
are you gonna do now

DANIEL
Oh yeah the Disneyland thing
That’s cute I like how whenever I
walk over you guys stop talking

DANNY VICKI
We didn’t We weren’t

DANIEL
Oh really What were you two
talking about

DANNY VICKI
Rock Band Nothing

T-Bone comes back over He has a slice of pizza that is
staked obscenely high with cheese and toppings

T-BONE
Hey Vicki
(to Daniel)
Hey new champ remind me later to
show you our secret little league
champion handshake ritual

DANIEL
Thanks T-Bone

T-Bone takes a bite toppings fall everywhere

VICKI
What kind of pizza’s that

T-BONE
It’s my own design My babies’ mama
told me I could only have one more
slice So I scooped the tops off
of a six other slices and stacked
them right on top Six layers is
about the max you can do

DANNY
Bet I can do eight

T-BONE
Let’s go big talker

DANNY
Son you wanna go stack pizza

DANIEL
I’m good Dad You go ahead

Danny exits with T-Bone Vicki looks annoyed Coach Rick gets
on a microphone

RICK
Let’s hear it again for the 2010

Everyone cheers

VICKI
(to Daniel)
So I know I’m the hundredth person
to ask but how’s it feel

DANIEL

relief Don’t tell Dad but ina

As he hangs up Rick shows up with a “Manager Rick” name tag

RICK
Are you quite done

DANNY
Well I hung up if that’s what you
mean

RICK

to spread my wealth of knowledge
around Like the Robin Hood of home
improvement smarts I take away
ignorance and give them my genius

RICK
How noble Look as your boss--

DANNY
Just so you know “boss” sounds a
little ridiculous plus
(whispering)
(MORE )

DANNY (contd)
I don’t think anybody really
believes it Let’s just keep it at

“Manager”

RICK
Danny you may have been the big
man in junior high then also in

high school and now around town

VICKI
(loudly)
Guys throw your dirty clothes in
the basket not at the basket Or
at least get your own rebound

DANIEL (0C)
(yelling from his room)
Those are Dads

VICKI
Shocker I got it Danny But
what’s the point That you hate
working for Rick

DANNY
That’s the point I don’t work for
Rick I work for the company and
for way longer than him I might
add

VICKI
But he’s a manager So go into
management Problem solved

DANNY
Well yes that problem would be
solved but then I’d have the
obvious bigger problem I couldn’t
wear shorts and a T-shirt to work
Plus overtime sucks Unless It’s in
football or basketball then it’s
pretty awesome And honey jerk
off’s and d bags are in management
All the cool guys work on the floor
like me

VICKI
Fine Then get a new job I guess
But Danny “jerk off’s d bags
cool guys” You sound like some
teenage kid

DANNY
As I recall that’s what you first
liked about me - my boyish charm

VICKI
I did But not any more Which
brings us back to the root of our
problems

DANNY
That’s not fair honey We can’t
blame our problems on Coach Rick

EXT CITY PARK - DAY

On a large outdoor stage the roly-poly MAYOR is at a podium
Daniel and his team including Coach Rick are on one side
Danny and his three teammates are on the other

MAYOR
Texas has its high school football
Indiana loves college basketball
But here in Flint Michigan we got
Little League baseball

The crowd cheers

MAYOR
It is my pleasure to introduce the
MVP of the 1973 Little League World
Series and what has to be the
proudest father in Flint Danny
Turner

Danny joins the Mayor who hands him a huge TROPHY Danny
then turns to give it to the new champs

DANNY
Thank you Mr Mayor Proud indeed
Son Firecrackers from us to you
congratulations You deserve it

MAYOR
Thank you Danny Daniel come on
up here Tell us how does it feel
to be the best

DANNY
(under his breath)
One of the best

The microphone picks up Danny’s comment which gets the
attention of everyone Danny quickly backs away from the mic

DANNY
Sorry I didn’t mean-- Never mind

The mayor is about to continue but Danny can’t resist and
steps back to the microphone

DANNY
I just meant yes they’re awesome
but you can’t really say “the best”
because they never played us
That’s all

Part of the crowd cheers for their beloved 1973 team Another
part yells for the new champs Coach Rick steps forward

RICK
Well Danny all I know is - we’re
the best today Now I would say
let’s hit the field and settle it
but it would hardly be fair now

DANNY
True

Danny nods in agreement The situation seems diffused

RICK
Fair to you guys that is I mean
you’re old and slow and way out of
shape We’d kill you

DANNY
How about I take this bat and

Danny covers the mic but his animated gestures say it all

MAYOR
Actually I think it’s a wonderful
idea Not the bat in theyou
know The game of the century
Firecrackers versus Firecrackers

The place erupts excited about the idea

BRENT MUSBURGER
I can count the greatest moments of

STUART SCOTT
Um why don’t you just use the
other hand For the sixth finger I
mean

Stuart Scott demonstrates

BRENT MUSBURGER
Fair enough At the center of it
all are father-son combo Danny and
Daniel Turner For all of those
boys who have ever wanted to beat
up their dads and for all those
dads falsely accused of child
abuse this one’s for you The
talent is obvious but this
showdown will be all about
experience and “know how” versus
youth and speed

INTERVIEWS WITH FLINT CITIZENS

CITIZEN
It’ll be a good game but I gotta
give the edge to the young ‘un’s
They’re on a streak

WOMAN CITIZEN
Sure they’re awesome But they’re

makes each piece of clothing extremely small and tight

VICKI

DANNY
He gets to play an extra game
Against his old man no less It’s
like when Ken Griffey Junior and
Senior played together in Seattle

VICKI
No it’s not Danny They played on
the same team You’re playing
against Daniel I just can’t
believe you some times You just
refuse to grow up and take
responsibility for your actions

DANNY
It wasn’t my idea What was I
supposed to say

VICKI
How about “no” or “thanks anyway”
Or maybe “Sorry I’m a grown-ass
man”
(beat)
Danny I want you to go

DANNY
Go Go where

VICKI
I don’t know You’re a grown man T-
Bone’s house a motel the YMCA

Okay boys we got ourselves a
situation Less than a week ago we
won the World Series But now we
have a chance to do something even
greater Be the best of all-time
The season is over so this is
strictly voluntary Now who’s with
me

None of the boys move They all look to Daniel who is
reluctant to agree Rick notices

RICK
Let me put it another way You boys
will be men someday For some they
become men when they go off to war
For some it’s when they have their
first drink first woman or first
arrest For some it’s when they go
against the advice of friends and
relatives and grow a bad ass
mustache But for others it’s when
they stand up to their fathers toe
to toe mano y mano Your time has
come What do you say men

The speech is enough for Daniel He steps forward

DANIEL
I’m in

The other boys follow suit all agreeing to play

INT TURNER HOUSE

DANNY
Looks like everybody forgot our old

some fielding exercises

MOMENTS LATER

Juan tapes Carlos’s glove on his hand with duct tape Carlos

quiet

So you went to the trouble of
faking your death

COACH OZARK
It’s easier than you think Just up
and moved a few towns over in the
middle of the night Had a war
buddy in Bangkok send a letter to
the newspaper saying he saw me
die

DANNY
T-Bone and I came here for nickel
beer night last year and saw you
bowling He thought it was just
some poor bastard who had the
misfortune of looking like you but
I was convinced

COACH OZARK
So you got a chance to recapture
your youth and you want me to come

back
DANNY
It wouldnt be the same without
you
COACH OZARK
Bullshit

DANNY
Okay we’re terrible It’s like

coach the team fine

Danny starts to walk away

COACH OZARK

dream team and run its rep into the
ground Call the paper tell ‘em to

INT DANNY’S WORKSHOP - EVENING

It’s even more of a wreck than before looking more like a
college dorm with the guys all staying there

The guys all crowd on and around a couch playing Rock Band
Danny is picking up trash filling a large garbage can

DANNY
Guys come on This isn’t some
spring break youth hostel When you
take off dirty clothes from
practice at least throw them in
the corner

He opens the door to set the garbage can outside Vicki is
standing there He steps out and closes the door to hide the
loud mess inside

EXT WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

DANNY
Hey we’re just in there studying
game film

VICKI
You talk to Daniel

DANNY
Yeah I saw him at the ballfield
Said he was going to the mall
VICKI
With Alex I’m sure He was
supposed to be home an hour ago He
texted me from a blocked phone
number saying he was running “L8”

DANNY
“Late”

VICKI
Yeah not sure how much time he’s
saving not typing two more letters
Is it just me or did he grow up
overnight

DANNY
You’re right He’s got one foot out
the door

VICKI
He was washing his shoes out with
the water hose Isn’t that weird

DANNY
Um no Guys do that from time to
time Keeps ‘em fresh I should
probably do mine How’s the bank
and those staggered lunches

VICKI
They’re fine And how’s the Depot

DANNY
Great I’m working the late shift
so I never run into Coach Rick

VICKI
I know you don’t like him that much
but he sure does treat Daniel well

DANNY
What I don’t

VICKI
I didn’t say that Danny It’s just
Daniel looks up to him as a role
model Maybe despite the game you
could try putting your differences
with Rick aside

They hear a car pull up out front

DANIEL (0C)
Thanks for the ride B Dog Ill
hit you in a bit Alex

Danny and Vicki meet him at the side of the house Daniel has
a freshly pierced lip which he doesn’t even acknowledge

DANIEL
Hey guys Sorry I’m late I already
ate by the way

DANNY
Hold up Lemme see your ring hot
rod

VICKI

What the-- Is that a lip ring

DANIEL
It’s no big deal It was a thank
you gift from Alex I’m letting her
wear my World Series ring

DANNY VICKI
What the-- What the--

DANIEL
Do me a solid and chill out P’s

VICKI
Ps Watch that tone you little
SOB

DANNY
(whispering to her)
That would make us B’s

Daniel heads inside Vicki continues to freak out about the
lip ring while Danny freaks out about the championship ring

INT HOME DEPOT - NIGHT

The place is closed Danny and T-Bone push orange shopping
carts down an aisle They are filled with baseball equipment

DANNY
I mean I wouldn’t trade my ring
for anything

T-BONE
How about an extra penis That’d be
pretty cool

DANNY
What No man
(beat)
Itd probably just get in the way

T-BONE
Excellent point

The guys turn a corner into the garden department

DANNY
Thanks for doing this T-Bone
Coach Rick scheduled me to pull a
double and do inventory I thought
about burning the place down but I
need the health insurance So I
figured why not get a little
practice in

The guys unload equipment from the shopping cart

T-BONE
Hey Danny I gotta ask you What
if we lose

DANNY
C’mon losing is for losers
Where’s your confidence

T-BONE
I was just thinking I know we
should win They’re kids But if we
don’t somehow then we’ll be a
joke We’ll be the adults that
played children and lost Before
we were Little League champs Big
fish in a little pond sure but I
liked that pond I don’t want to
get out of that pond

DANNY
I guess we can’t lose then

Danny and T-Bone do their little ritual
A LITTLE LATER

The two have moved shelves and plants out of the way They’ve
set up a backstop and a pitcher’s mound made of mulch

DANNY
Alright let’s just kind of go half
speed Don’t want to wreck the
place

Danny winds up and throws a wild pitch that hits a bank of
lights

DANNY
Like that

T-BONE
Had to get one out of your system

A LITTLE LATER

The whole area is wrecked Entire shelves have fallen over
displays are up-ended

Other employees have gathered to watch An older INDIAN MAN
is at the makeshift plate

T-BONE
Alright ace Let’s see that sweet
knuckle curve

INDIAN MAN
Bring it Danny

Danny throws his infamous pitch - an easy strike

INDIAN MAN
Damn man I’1l never make it in the
bigs

Danny rubs his shoulder Just then Rick comes in

RICK
Just what in the hell

Employees disperse T-Bone nonchalantly acts as though he’s
doing inventory Rick approaches Danny

RICK
And to think I felt guilty

DANNY
Well that was probably your gut
feeling and you should go with it
So I’1l leave you now to clean this
up

RICK
Youre unbelievable And you’re on
graveyard

DANNY
Graveyard Do we even have a
graveyard shift
RICK
We do now

DANNY

Come on this just got a little out
of hand Okay a lot out of hand

Hey I just want to give you the
best game possible

RICK
Youre right Tell you what a
letter of apology should do it

DANNY
To corporate

RICK
To me And I’1l forget about this
Something like “Dear Boss I am
sorry for being a child In the
future Ill try harder to follow
your example of what a responsible
and professional man should--

DANNY
Orrr I could just shorten it to
“Dear shit head I quit”
EXT TURNER HOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY

Danny is cleaned up looks nice has flowers
the back door Vicki answers

VICKI
What is this

DANNY
I wanted to ask you out on a date
VICKI

a) pick up some hot wings watch
some mixed martial arts and then
sneak into the hot tub at the
Holiday Inn b) go out to a
romantic dinner then for a walk

awesome combo of the two

He knocks

RICK
Your mom and I have plans and your
dad wants to fight me

DANIEL

VICKI
You told me you wanted to talk
about Daniel

DANNY

RICK

model around a positive adult male
influence

DANIEL
I’m a teenager

DANNY
Come on Enough with the “teenager”
stuff Go to your room

DANIEL
Why We’re talking about me
Shouldn’t I be involved

INT TURNER HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
Rick and Vicki sit at the kitchen table He has a busted lip
RICK
Rick and Vick hanging out having

coffee We could be a talk show
“Hanging with Rick and Vick”

VICKI
Except my name is Vicki

RICK
“Hanging with Ricky and Vicki”
then

VICKI

What did you want to tell me about
Daniel
RICK

I just wanted to assure you that
I’m here for you guys You’re not
alone The season is over and soon
this game will be too But just
because I won’t be Daniel’s coach
anymore doesn’t mean he can’t still
come to me for guidance You too

VICKI
I can come to you for guidance

RICK
Maybe not guidance Other stuff
like friendship advice company

VICKI
Yeah I’m not sure

RICK
Danny’s great barrel of laughs I
tried to help him at work but he
wouldn’t let me I guess some men
are quitters and others refuse to
grow up Fortunately I’m neither

VICKI
Well I ama little concerned
about Daniel He wants to be so
grown up

RICK

“Growing up” is one of my
specialities That and poetry and
snuggling Maybe I could have a
talk with him If I don’t who
will right Also romantic
comedies another specialty And
taking walks Oh and listening
I’m the best listener you know

VICKI
Anything you’re not good at

RICK
Sucking Acting like a teenager
Killing defenseless animals like
kittens or bunnies Lying being
lazy or racist - I’m not good at
those things

As he goes on Vicki is clearly over it

INSERT ESPN SPORTSCENTER

EXT RUNDOWN FIELD - MORNING
The guys are stretching out

COACH OZARK
Okay Strawberry Shortcake and
Friends gather ‘round The game is
less than a week away and I thought
you should see a little action
(MORE )

COACH OZARK (contd)
So I set up a scrimmage A buddy of
mine runs a correctional facility
and he owed me a favor So he sent
over their softball team

A gray bus with barred windows pulls up A guard armed with a
shotgun steps off As the tough PLAYERS start to unload we
see on the side of the bus “Michigan State Women’s Prison”

The guys are lined up as the women players pass by Some of
the guys are nervous some scared some totally into it

DANNY
(to Coach Ozark)
Women Coach Really

COACH OZARK
Youre already playing children
Would you rather I got you an old
folks home to play Maybe a school
for the blind Just play ‘em like
you would men Only thing is you
gotta pitch underhand

DANNY
Perfect

LATER

The guys bat first The pitches come fast and accurate The
game might as well be against an inner-city gang The women
play vicious

MONTAGE

--The pitcher intentionally hits a few batters A runner from
third plows over T-Bone

--A disputed tag at second almost turns into a riot

--A guy runner trapped between second and third is tackled
--At first Danny can only throw grapefruits lobbing the
ball over the plate but as he watches and studies the

women’s pitcher he starts to get the hang of it

Tension builds with players bruised and bloodied Then as
soon as the game ends the women turn into ladies

WOMAN PRISONER
Thanks so much for having us

WOMAN PRISONER 2
We had such a lovely time

WOMAN PRISONER 3
Next time we get home field
advantage

Everybody laughs
LATER
As the bus pulls away hands stick out windows waving “bye”

COACH OZARK
The lesson here is Don’t play like
there’s no tomorrow Play like
youre being incarcerated tomorrow

CONTINUE MINI-MONTAGE

--As the days pass the guys practice enjoying themselves
getting better and back in shape

--After practice Daniel leaves his teammates to hang with
older kids

--Vicki reads Danny’s old notes on the fridge calender “Tell
Vicki she’s great” “Remind wife she’s a hotty” She smiles
then sees “Build rooftop water slide” She shakes her head

END MINI-MONTAGE
The guys head to the dugout hot and sweaty from practice

COACH OZARK
Alright Girls Gone Wild the game
is two days away Try not to do
anything stupid like get arrested
or punch out the other team’s
coach Now excuse me while I go
somewhere that you guys are not

EXT TURNER HOUSE - EVENING
Coach Rick shows up with a potholder He hands it to her
RICK
I brought you this potholder It’s
Macrame I made it It’s nothing
just another thing I’m good at
She sniffs then makes a face
VICKI

Check your shoes I think you may
have stepped in dog crap

RICK
No they were actually filled with
feces I refuse to throw them out
because then they win Pranks so
cute and childish The guys got us
pretty good Of course I’ve
directed my players not to
retaliate

VICKI
Can I help you with something

RICK
Oh well I just wanted to stop by
and check on you and Daniel Maybe
make amends with Danny be the
bigger man that kind of thing

VICKI
I think he’s gone to practice

RICK
Truth is Id like to talk about
Daniel Seriously On the serious
tip For “sers”
INT FONDU RESTAURANT - LATER

Rick and Vicki at a table with a pot of cheese between them

RICK
Welcome back to the “Rick and Vick
Show”

VICKI
So

RICK

So cheese makes everything better
I believe it was the Swiss who
invented it Before then macaroni
just laid there - plain Grilled
cheeses were just two pieces of
toast Personally I try to limit
my cheese intake And if I do goa
little overboard sure I’1l throw

it up

VICKI
Rick we were going to talk about
Daniel

RICK

Question Vick
VICKI
Vicki

RICK
Tomato tomaato

VICKI
No it’s my name It’s Vicki

RICK
Fair enough Question Vicki
What’s the most important thing in
the world to you

VICKI
I give up

RICK
Daniel’s future And it just so
happens that I have secured it

VICKI
I’m not following

RICK
Daniel will be in eighth grade next
year But I’ve made arrangements
with Lansing Prep--only the best
private high school in the state--
to accept him a year early He’1l
have special classes of course
But--and here’s the kicker--they’11l
give him a waiver to play high
school baseball

VICKI
Oh Rick I dunno I mean let me
talk to Daniel But he isn’t--

RICK
No I already asked him he’s into
it He loves the idea

VICKI
I’m sure he does But he’s already
trying to grow up so fastand now
to start high school early

RICK
(sympathetically)
With no responsible role model

VICKI
Exactly

RICK
Well that’s the best part Vicki
I’1l be with him The high school
is making me the head baseball
coach I gotta teach drivers ed
also Not too excited about that
But hey I can teach Daniel to
drive right

VICKI
Wait a sec Is your new job
contingent on bringing Daniel with
you

RICK
Define “contingent”

VICKI
Did you make a deal to recruit a
twelve year old boy in order to get
a job

RICK
Whoa I’m sensing hostility here
Yes Daniel and I are a package
deal But I wouldn’t take the job
without him He’s my prize horse

VICKI
Your prize horse

RICK
Bad example He’s like

VICKI
A fighting rooster a pit bull a
trained seal

RICK

Those are bad examples right
VICKI

Yes
RICK

Then no he’s not like those I’ve
been his coach for three years
Taught him the game I made him the
young man he’s become I love your
son like he was my own

VICKI
But he’s not your son And you
didn’t teach him to play ball or
throw a curve-slider or become a
young man Danny did Danny may not
be a responsible adult but I guess
he knows how to raise one Now
excuse me Rick

She gets up
RICK
But we still have a whole pot of

melted cheese Vick

VICKI
My name is Vicki

She takes his hat and pushes it down in the cheese She walks
out

RICK
(to whoever is listening)
Can I get a to go cup
EXT RUNDOWN PRACTICE FIELD - NIGHT

The “guys” gather around a campfire in the outfield sitting
on an old bench folding camp chairs etc

Hughes cooks a hot dog T-Bone roasts a dozen marshmallows on
a wire hanger Mouth counts them

T-BONE
What They shrink down in your
stomach

MOUTH

How many stomachs you got
Freedom has a squirrel cooking on a stick

FREEDOM
I’ve trapped enough squirrel and
possum for everybody So eat up

ROSS
Or we could just order a pizza and
inject ourselves with random
diseases - same thing

FREEDOM
Fine More squirrel for me

He tastes his smoldering squirrel

DANNY
This is it boys This is what life
is all about

General agreement from the others
DANNY

Hey you guys ever think we uh

MOUTH
No not really I went on to be a
lawyer

ROSS

Yeah I have a cabin and a boat

HUGHES
And my wife is hot way out of my
league I’m still not even sure how
I pulled that one off

CHARLIE

Thirteen was good But you kiddin’
I went on to have a top ten hit
well top twenty twenties it
was in the twenties okay Number
twenty eight For three weeks in
the Summer of ‘86 I was a god

Not getting the answer he was hoping for Danny tries again

DANNY
Well yeah right But still it’s
crazy all the sacrifices we made
for one more shot at glory

JUAN
Not us We hated that job Our boss
was skimming off our paychecks

CARLOS
We were plotting our revenge
involving kidnapping blackmail and
flame throwers

JUAN
But we can go back and do that
anytime

MOUTH
I can pretty much take off whenever
Id like Plus I’m what you call
“rich” so I’m not really missing
the income

T-BONE
I know a little about sacrifice
I’ve had to skip going to Home
Cookin’ Buffet on Tuesdays That
sucks

Again Danny doesn’t find anyone who identifies with him

DANNY
I guess I meant more us having
to give up family time

T-BONE
At our house Buffet Tuesday is
family time And yes Ill admit
it I have some gravy issues

FREEDOM
Family time was one of my reasons
for coming back Wanted to
reconnect with my folks Guess I
can check that off my list and
disappear for another ten years

CARLOS
Our wives are in Buenas Aires and
Mazatlan

JUAN

And Costa Rica

CARLOS
And Costa Rica almost forgot about
those wives But they’re all far
away so we do whatever we want

T-BONE
I just remembered I gotta be home
by eleven by choice

Danny realizes that maybe he’s alone in his situation

DANNY
I was thinking and tell me if I’m
crazy but what if you guys all
moved back to Flint

MOUTH
Yeah you’re crazy And I should
know I make my living with the
insanity plea ‘Course to convince
a judge I always recommend drawing
pictures with your do-do

DANNY
Hear me out If you guys lived
around here we could keep this
going maybe start our own league
What if we got a hold of the team
we played from Panama and had a re-
match

ROSS
But we already beat them

Danny stands frustrated

DANNY
That’s not the point

T-BONE
What is the point Danny

DANNY
The point is How many chances do
you get to be a kid

HUGHES
One And we already had it

The other guys all nod in agreement Danny takes this in
EXT PARK — DAY

Daniel and Alex are hanging out He’s showing her his knuckle
curve He has his supply bag with his equipment

DANIEL
The trick is where you place your
fingers Here and here

ALEX
That’s it Now I can throw the
famous Turner knuckle-curve ball

He walks over the back stop
DANIEL

Well that’s half of it The other
half is the release Go ahead
She throws a wild pitch

DANIEL
I should mention you gotta have
about five hundred hours of
practice

ALEX
Oh is that all

DANIEL
Now the real trick is being able to
keep it up It really wears on the
arm And if you throw it wrong you
could throw your shoulder out

ALEX
Your dad taught you this Shouldn’t
it be a secret

DANIEL
It is Nobody else knows it

ALEX
Why are you showing me

DANIEL
Well because you’re my
girlfriend

ALEX

Girlfriend huh

He cares about us being buddies
like he’s my big brother or
something All the other dads have
rules they punish their kids yell
at them give them advice My dad
builds tree houses organizes hot
dog eating contests or
challenges my baseball team And
did he ever think that maybe I
might want to be called “Danny”

T-BONE
But he’s Danny

DANIEL
Exactly

T-BONE
It’s true your dad is a bit kid-
like Okay more than a bit

Okay he’s a freakish man-child

straight A’s in parenting class

DANIEL

no such class That’s the thing
Daniel Parenting is something you
get from your own parents and TV

job My oldest daughter was like

been in trouble You’re smart
People like you You’1ll be in
eighth grade this year the big dog
in middle school

DANIEL
Actually I got a chance to start
high school a year early My dad
doesn’t know But I’m sure he’1ll
want me to so I can start pitching
in high school

T-BONE
Don’t be so sure pal Sure your
dad loves seeing you play and win
I know you want to be grown up but
it’s a little like leaving college
and entering the draft early

DANIEL
Exactly What’s wrong with that

T-BONE
Nothing If you’re twenty one and
about to get paid and ready to
start your life Here’s your other
option stay in eighth grade be
the most popular kid in school
history be a leader make a bunch
of friends

DANIEL
And play baseball

T-BONE
Or don’t Maybe you’1l want to
wrestle instead or play an
instrument or be an actor

DANIEL
Think my dad would let me

T-BONE
I know he would Because no matter
how old you are or how old you act
he respects your right to decide
what you want to do Would he be
disappointed Sure but would he
back you up Definitely

EXT RUNDOWN FIELD - DAY

Danny pitches to T-Bone practicing his knuckle-curve Danny
grimaces after throwing

T-BONE
How’s the shoulder

DANNY
Body doesn’t bounce back like when
we were kids

T-BONE
You and me both buddy You ever
wonder what we’d be like if wed
never played baseball

DANNY
No Why

T-BONE
I just mean we played ball all the
time growing up Nothing else
really What if Daniel decided
baseball wasn’t for him

DANNY

Yeah right That’s a good one

(beat)
But I guess as long as he was
happythen I guess that’d be
cool

(beat)
Why

T-BONE
Just wondering Working on being a
better parent I guess

DANNY
You and me both buddy

LATER
Coach Ozark has his team huddled up ready for practice

COACH OZARK
Alright listen up Mothers Against
Drunk Driving I got something to
say It’s as if a girl from my past
that I met at a party once called
me out of the blue and said
“Congrats you’re the father of
nine babies And they’re all boys
and they play baseball” Then I
took off before she could make me
pay child support or change
diapers Then years later I ran
into all of you and you’d grown
up Into a blood-sucking lawyer
a drifter auto workers with a
death wish and a has-been singer
and a bunch of other guys

DANNY
Thanks

COACH OZARK
Sit down I’m not done Eat a big
meal tonight Lots of pasta Get
your rest T-Bone if there’s any
way you can drop twenty pounds
tonight that’d be swell No final
practice today Instead I want you
to do whatever you do together -
tea party quilting circle
etcetera And remember your team
unity Going the distance for your
brothers willing to kill or bury
a body - no questions asked or
lend him your wife That was team
unity back in my day Wrecked a lot
of families now that I think about
it Now excuse me while I go
wrestle with the ghosts of bad
decisions

Coach Ozark heads off The guys look around unsure what to
do

DANNY
Anybody remember what we did the
night before the 1973 championship

T-BONE

DANNY
Let’s do this

SERIES OF SHOTS - The kids and adults seriously compete at
arcade games skee ball air hockey mini basketball Dance
Dance Revolution shooting gallery putt putt and go carts

Some of the kids pitch against a backdrop Their speed is
clocked by a radar gun

A teammate of Daniel grabs him at an arcade game

KID 1
Daniel they’re clocking pitches

You gotta try to beat it

Daniel walks over to the pitching game His teammates pat him
on the back encouraging him to throw Daniel starts
stretching out his arm Just then Danny walks up

DANNY
Hey son what are you doing You’re
not gonna pitch are you You gotta
save your arm You got a game

easy

Daniel tosses the ball up and catches it

DANIEL

MOMENTS LATER

An even bigger crowd has gathered The teenage game operator
hands Danny and Daniel each three balls

Daniel pitches first - 62 MPH
Danny pitches - 65 MPH T-Bone leans over to Danny’s ear

T-BONE

curve so release a bit sooner

Everybody laughs Daniel tries to take it in stride Danny
turns to walk away As he does he grimaces in pain T-Bone
catches up to Danny

T-BONE

DANNY
I think I just threw my arm out I
gotta go find some ice

As Danny heads for the exit he passes Bumper Boats Daniel
calls from the other side of the shallow pool

DANIEL
Rematch old man

Danny turns to face his son Like an old west saloon others
see how serious they are and clear out

MOMENTS LATER

Father and son are in bumper boats They head straight at each
other in a game of chicken Both boats overturn T-Bone jumps
in the water and grabs Daniel and Danny to make sure they’re
okay

KID PLAYER

EXT WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

stupid stunts went way too far

T-BONE
Oh you mean shaving dogs and
writing “1973” in the grass

POLICE
So you admit it

T-Bone and the guys rolling their eyes yes They laugh

POLICE
I got thirty eight ruined lawns

Transition from ESPN coverage to the game itself
EXT FLINT BALLPARK —- DAY

Coach Ozark and Coach Rick go to home plate and exchange
lineup cards with a sea of signs behind them The two huge
stands are divided in their support

Danny and T-Bone get ready to take the field They look
around The place is a circus

T-BONE
Man this is insane

DANNY
When did it become about so much
more than baseball

Coach Rick and Daniel are in the dugout

RICK
Remember today is about redemption
revenge payback personal satis--

DANIEL
It’s just about baseball

Charlie sings a “Big Hair” version of the National Anthem

The obsessed hair-cutting fan from earlier runs out onto the
field with scissors quickly tackled by two policemen

Daniel sees Alex by the fence He runs over

DANIEL
Did you wanna wish me luck Hey
where’s my ring

ALEX
Oh it’s at home I realized I
wasn’t meeting as many guys as I
used to when I was wearing it

DANIEL
Meeting guys You’re my girlfriend

ALEX
Right and you’re one of my
boyfriends And I’m here to support
you

Just then Pierced Kid walk up He has a black eye It’s
obvious that he and Alex are together

ALEX
Guess I’1ll see you around Oh
good luck

She and Pierced Kid walk away Daniel returns to his dugout
deflated

From his own dugout a concerned Danny sees the whole thing
Coach Ozark approaches Danny who is rubbing his shoulder

COACH OZARK
How’s the shoulder kid

DANNY
Not good I’m remembering why I
stopped playing

Coach Ozark claps his hands together loudly and slowly starts
rubbing them together The music swells Coach puts his hands
in Danny’s shirt on his shoulder and makes a few movements

COACH OZARK
Better

DANNY
Um No No not at all What
the hell was that

COACH OZARK

Saw that Japanese guy from “Happy
Days” do it in a movie once
Thought it was worth a shot All I
can tell you now is suck it up

UMPIRE

Play ball
SERIES OF SHOTS - Danny throws a few pitches
T-Bone approaches the mound
T-BONE

What’s up Danny I signaled for
you fast ball

DANNY
That was my fast ball

T-BONE
Oh wellthrow it a little faster

ANOTHER SERIES OF SHOTS
Danny gives up a few hits His arm starts to run out of gas

Daniel is striking out the guys except Danny who keeps
getting singles

Daniel is mowing down the rest of the guys one by one After
striking out T-Bone returns to the dugout

T-BONE
My God that kid is ruthless

DANNY
For the first time during this
whole thing I’m a little scared

T-BONE
What

DANNY
My shoulder can’t take much more

T-BONE
I thought this whole time it was
one of those situations where you
taught him everything you know but
maybe held back a few things

DANNY
Held back On my son Not only did
I teach him everything I know but
it looks like he learned a few
things behind my back

UMPIRE
Strike three

DANNY
Oh great I get to go out and pitch
some more

Danny and T-Bone do their little ritual - without much
enthusiasm Daniel and his team return to their dugout

A LITTLE LATER

Danny has walked another batter

UMPIRE
Batter take your base

T-Bone goes out to the mound

T-BONE
Hey stop making me come out here
so much Do you know how much all
this stuff weighs

DANNY
I’m done

Coach Ozark comes out

COACH OZARK
Did I lip read “I’m done”

DANNY
Coach I can’t throw

COACH OZARK
Oh hell if I leave now I can
still make happy hour Thanks for
nothing

Coach Ozark starts to walk away then turns back
COACH OZARK

Stop acting like a woman and start
pitching like one

DANNY
(to T-Bone)
Does he mean what I think he means
T-BONE
I believe he does Danielle

Danny swallows his pride and starts pitching underhanded
fast pitch like the ladies from the women’s prison

At first the kid players Rick and the crowd all laugh Then
Danny is able to get a few strikes across the plate

SERIES OF SHOTS - Danny gets in a groove Danny and Daniel
are now pitching almost everyone out at the plate Both
coaches come out to argue calls

LATER

It’s the sixth (and final) inning The score is 3-2 The kids
are ahead Ross on first With two outs Danny is up

IN THE STANDS - CONTINUOUS

Turns out Brent Musburger and Reggie Jackson are there as a
fans They talk to each other as if they’re on the air

BRENT MUSBURGER
“Mister October” you don’t need to
be Al Einstein to know this is it
Two outs down by one Coming up to
the plate father And on the
mound son Oh baby this is drama

REGGIE JACKSON
I tell ya Brent I’m just glad I’m
not in the car for that ride home

BACK ON THE FIELD - CONTINUOUS

As Danny walks out of his dugout he looks at the faces of
his teammates and recalls their words at the campfire
Lastly he bumps fists with T-Bone

DANNY
What are we gonna do tomorrow

T-BONE
I dunno I guess tomorrow we go
back to our lives

As Danny steps up to the plate he glances over at Vicki in
the stands then at Daniel

UMPIRE
(to Danny)
Whatever happens you gotta be damn
proud of that kid

DANNY
(looks back)
Sure am Time please

UMPIRE
Time out

Danny walks out to the mound Everyone in the stands dugouts
and announcers box is confused Even Vicki can’t quite figure
out what’s going on

DANIEL
Dad what are you doing

DANNY
Looked like things aren’t going so
well with Alex

DANIEL
Wanna say you told me so

DANNY
No I wanna say forget her
There’ll be others You’re a
teenager now almost a man And
I’m proud of you

DANIEL
Thanks I knew that though Can we
finish please There’s a lot of
people watching

DANNY
Let them watch

Coach Rick comes out to complain The umpire meets him at the
mound

RICK
Hey ump what’s going on This guy
is bothering my pitcher

DANNY
Give us a minute Rick

RICK
I don’t like it That’s my ace out
there and--

DANIEL
Coach Rick

RICK
What’s up super star

DANIEL
Go back to the dugout and sit down
and zip it My dad and I are
talking

Rick exits speechless The umpire also walks away

DANNY
Man you’re tough

DANIEL
I had a good teacher

DANNY
Thanks

DANIEL
I meant Mom

Vicki heads onto the field The crowd is now really confused
She passes by Rick who is headed back to his dugout

RICK
Good maybe you can tell him how it
is

VICKI

Like this You’re a conniving
spineless little excuse for a man
Stay away from my son stay away
from my husband and stay away from
me Or so help me I’11 take this
bat

Vicki picks up a bat leaning against the fence
IN THE STANDS

From Brent and Reggie’s vantage point we can see that Vicki
is telling Rick just where she’1ll put with the bat

BRENT MUSBURGER
What do you make of that Reggie
Jackson
REGGIE JACKSON
It appears Vicki Turner is giving
Coach Rick some batting advice
BACK ON FIELD

Vicki makes her way to the mound

VICKI
How’s the shoulder
DANIEL DANNY
Fine Fine
VICKI
How’s it going out here
DANIEL DANNY
Fine Fine
VICKI

What’s going on out here

DANNY
It just hit me Tomorrow we go
back to our lives And my life
isn’t much of one without you two
Even though I was probably the
coolest Dad of all time I
definitely could have been a better
Dad And this may come as a shock
to you but I think I could be and
should be a better husband

VICKI
Thank you I-- we needed to hear
that But I think we can talk about
this at home There’s like a lot of
people watching

DANIEL
Let them watch

DANNY

Baseball is important Little
League is important But you two
are the whole world to me I’m not
taking it for granted and I’m gonna
do whatever it takes to prove that

The three hug The confused crowd cheers Vicki heads back to
the stands Danny starts back toward the plate

DANIEL
Hey Dad this doesn’t mean you’re
going to take it easy on me does

it

DANNY
I’1l never take it easy on you
again

Danny grabs the bat and steps up to the plate

Daniel winds up and throws his knuckle curve Danny crushes
it deep to left field He starts jogging to first The ball
goes just outside the foul pole The kids breathe a sigh of
relief Daniel turns around to his outfielders

DANIEL
Guys shift left and move back way
back

The outfielders shift Daniel throws another knuckle curve
Danny hits it deep the opposite direction to right field
Everybody is on their feet watching as this one fouls the
other way into the parking lot

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

The foul ball smashes through the windshield of Rick’s car
EXT BALLPARK STANDS - CONTINUOUS

Brent turns to Reggie

BRENT MUSBURGER
That’s back to back knuckle curves
from Daniel and his dad has knocked
the stuffing out of them both

REGGIE JACKSON
With an 0-2 count you gotta think
he’1l throw a few in the dirt and
see if his old man will go after
them

BACK ON FIELD

DANNY
Uh-oh I think I found my swing
son

Rick comes out of the dugout

RICK

Infield move back Spread out
across the fence

(to himself)
He can have the base hit But I’1l
be damned if I’m giving him the
long ball

(to Daniel)
It’s all up to you Daniel

The kid players are now spread deep in the outfield Only
Daniel and his catcher remain in the infield

Daniel pitches Danny hits a grounder between first and
second and takes off

As Danny rounds first an outfielder scoops up the ball and
throws it to second base where Daniel is already standing

Daniel catches the ball just before Danny gets there Danny
runs right into him and Daniel hits the ground hard

Before the second base umpire calls Danny “out” he sees that
the ball was knocked out of Daniel’s glove Danny notices too
and heads for third where the kid catcher waits

Daniel jumps up and grabs the ball ready to fire it to
third He holds off as Danny has already stopped on base

Daniel and Danny lock eyes They both look over at home
plate which is left completely unguarded It’s on

Danny takes off from third and Daniel from second Both head
straight for home realizing it’s winner take all

They close in both diving head first It’s an even bigger
and badder collision than the one at second Daniel holds on
to the ball The home plate umpire is there to make the call

UMPIRE
You’re out

The Kids win They immediately mob the field

Danny shakes his head and smiles He lifts Daniel up on his
shoulder The crowd eats it up

The guys of the 1973 team seem bummed for a beat Then
taking a cue from Danny the guys each lift up a kid player
on their shoulders Before long all the kids are raised up

Coach Ozark just shakes his head Rick looks over at him and
points back and forth as if to say “You and me” Ozark spits
on the ground and joins the players

The town pours on to the field like the end of a college
football game

T-Bone bumps into the kids’ CATCHER

CATCHER
T-Bone Malone you’re the reason I
became a catcher

T-BONE
Is that right

A group of men in their 70’s wearing faded baseball
uniforms approaches Danny and his team The Commandant is
among them

COMMANDANT
Danny let us know when you boys
are done licking your wounds and
you want a real game

DANNY
Um yes sir Will do

The guys all nod “sure thing” humoring the old men

Danny looks over at Daniel and Vicki and mouths No way”
The three walk off the field Danny’s arms are around his
wife and son’s shoulders

EPILOGUE
As music plays we see the following

--Coach Ozark gives a Middle School baseball team the “puke
speech” Daniel is among the players

--T-Bone is there as an assistant coach giving special
attention to the kid catcher from the game

--Mouth is in a prison visit Turns out to be one of the
women from the softball game Mouth puts his hand to the
glass affectionately She does the same

--Freedom is content back in nature His new cell phone
rings - a call from “Mom” He smiles as he answers

--Charlie rocks out singing the National Anthem at a Major
League baseball ball game

--The Gonzales brothers are back at the auto shop The old
white guy points for them to get to work As he turns away
Carlos nods to Juan who pulls out a length of duct tape

--Rick who has been busted back down to “orange apron”
status tries to impress Home Depot customers with his ring
He has no luck

EXT DANNY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

The workshop has been turned into a business A new sign
above it reads “Dan’s Treehouses and Forts”

Vicki and Daniel pull up in the driveway Danny takes off his
toolbelt and wipes off his hands He greets Vicki with a
kiss

DANNY

hamburger patty

The three head inside

FADE OUT

DANNY
So I just smashed it up and added
tomato sauce and onions and stuff
and I’m now calling it chili
