This is Spinal Tap

Film Studio

Marty Hello My name is Marty DeBergi Ima film maker I
make a lot of commercials That little dog that chases the
covered wagon underneath the sink That was mine
In 1966 I went down to Greenwich Village New York City to a
rock club called the Electric Banana Dont look for it its
not there anymore But that night I heard a band that for me

redefined the word rock and roll I remember being knocked
out by their their exuberance their raw power -- and their
punctuality

That band was Britains now-legendary Spinal Tap Seventeen
years and fifteen albums later Spinal Tap is still going
strong and theyve earned a distinguished place in rock history
as one of Englands loudest bands

So in the late fall of 1982 when I heard that Tap was

releasing a new album called Smell the Glove and was

planning their first tour of the United States in almost 6 years
to promote that album well needless to say I jumped at the
chance to make the documentary the if you will rockumentary
that youre about to see I wanted to capture the the sights
the sounds the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road
And I got that But I got more a lot more But hey -- enough
of my yakkin Whaddaya say lets boogie

Outside the venue

Fan 1 Gives me a lot of energy makes me happy

Fan 2 Heavy metals deep you can get stuff out of it
Fan 3 The way they dress the leather

David Well before that we were in different groups I was ina
group called The Creatures and w-which was a skiffle group

Nigel I was in Lovely Lads
David Yeah

Nigel And then we looked at each other and says well we might as well
join up you know and uh

David So we became The Originals

Nigel Right
David And we had to change our name actually
Nigel Well there was there was another group in the east end called The

Originals and we had to rename ourselves

David The New Originals

Nigel The New Originals and then uh they became

David The Regulars they changed their name back to The Regulars and
we thought well we could go back to The Originals but

whats the point

Nigel We became The Thamesmen at that point

Philadelphia metropolitan area

David So you are hitting that market regardless of how were selling
in New York

Ian We are doing we certainly are doing well Im doing everything

blaming you

Marty But you dont feel these guys have an effect on an audience

Lets talk about your reviews a little bitregarding Intravenus
de Milo This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of
musical invention within The musical growth rate of this band
cannot even be charted They are treading water in a sea of
retarded sexuality and bad poetry

Thats thats nit picking isnt it

The Gospel According to Spinal Tap This pretentious ponderous
collection of religious rock psalms is enough to prompt the
question What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap and couldnt

e have rested on that day too

Never heard that one
Thats a good one thats a good one

The review you had on Shark Sandwichwhich was merely a two
word review - just said Shit sandwich Umm

All those arguments about touring or not touring and all

that its obvious we belong on tour you know

I couldnt agree more All that stuff about you being too

old and you being too white but

But what about the album Ian

Well thats the real problem theres no way to promote

something that doesnt exist you know

Its a very unimportant reason its just that theyre experimenting
with with some new uhpackaging materials Let me get the door
What kind of experimenting What they got monkeys opening it or

Tan

Yeah it should be out now its called Smell the Glove
yeahyeah yeah

Smell the Glove Its a provocative title

Wait till you see the cover wait till you see the cover
very provcative indeed

Bobbi Bobbi can I tear you away from all of this

Do you have a drink Everything ok

No I dont I dont really need one But listen umI really
I really do have to talk to you a bit about this uh

Ian come on tell me whatever is on your mind

this whole issue of the uhthe issue of the cover

Yeah
uh we feel I mean we feel and it seems to be facts
that uhthe company is rather down on the cover

Is that the case

Yes
You can give it to me straight you know
Listen umm they dont like the cover they dont like the cover

Uh huh well that is certainly straight

They find it very offensive and very sexist

Well what exactlydo you find offensive I mean whats offensive
Ian you put a greased naked woman

Yes

--on all fours

Yes

with a dog collar around her neck

with a dog collar

and a leash

and a leash

and a mans arm extended out up to here holding on to the leash
and pushing a black glove in her face to sniff it You dont find

that offensive you dont find that sexist

No I dont this is 1982 Bobbi come on

Thats right its 1982 get out of the 60s we dont have this
mentality any more

Well you shoulda seen the cover they wanted to do It wasnt a glove
believe me

I dont care what they wanted to do now see this is something Ian
that you are going to have to talk to your boys about

Were certainly not laying down any conditions

And I dont think that a sexy cover is the answer for why an album

sells or doesnt sell becuase you tell methe White Album
what was that There was nothing on that goddamn cover Excuse me
the phones ringing Ian well talk about this after

Okay bye bye

Hello Oh hi Dennis Uh oh okay Why dont you tell him
Okay hold on one minute Ian Its Eaton-Hogg he wants to talk
to you

Okay Thank you darling
Youre welcome dear
Hello Sir Dennis Hi how are you
(out of phone) Oh fucking old poofdah (into phone) But its
really not that offensive Sir Dennis come on Okay Ill call
you absolutely first thing in the morning (slam phone) Ah shit
They are not gonna release the albumbecause they have decided that
the cover is sexist
Well so what Whats wrong with being sexy I mean theres no
Sex-ist
-ist not sexy
Okay listen I wanted to tell you this and andI was holding back
because I didnt know what Dennis decision was going to be
but at this point both Sears and K-Mart stores have refused to
handle the album Theyre boycotting the album only because of
the cover If the first album had been a hit
If the company is behind the album it can shove it right down
their throats
Money talks and bullshit walks and if the first album was a hit
then we could have pressed on them then we could have told them

The musicevery cut on this album is a hit

LetsI dont give a shit what the albums

Its a matter of compromise we made a joke and it was a long time
ago theyre making it like a big deal

Thats true You know if we were serious and we said yes she
should be forced to sniffsmell the glove then youd have a
point you know but its all a joke isnt it were making fun

of that sort of thing

It is and it isnt she should be made to smell it but

But not you know over and over again

You know we can probably work something out Ill talk to Dennis
and maybe we can come up with a compromise A new design concept
that we can all live with

six words in the whole song you know Just repeat them over and
over again

Lets talk about your music todayuhone thing that puzzles me
-umis the make up of your audience seems to be uh
predominately young boys

Well its a sexual thing really isnt it Aside from the
identifying the boys do with us theres also a re-reaction to the
female of the female to our music How did you put it
Really theyre quite fearful - thats my theory They see us on
stage with tight trousers weve got you know armadillos in our
trousers I mean its really quite frightening

Yeah

Its a rather lurid cover I meanah its its like naked
women and uh

Hes tied down to this table

Uh-huh

And hes got these whips and theyre allsemi-nude

Knockin on im and its like much worse

Whats the point

Well the point is its much worse than Smell the Glovehe
releases that hes number three

Because hes the victim Their objections were that she was the
victim You see

I see

Oh

Ah

Thats alright if the singers the victim its different Its
not sexist

He did a twist on it A twist and it s-

He did he did He turned it around

We shoulda thought of that

We were so close

I mean if we had all you guys tied up that probably woulda been
fine

Ah

But itsits still a stupid cover

Its such a fine line between stupid an

-and clever

Yeah and clever

Just that little turnabout

I have a small piece of bad news Although it may not be that bad
For a change you mean

funds

The last time Tap toured America they where uh booked into
10000 seat arenas and 15000 seat venues and it seems that now
on their current tour theyre being booked into 1200 seat

arenas 1500 seat arenas and uh I was just wondering

does this mean uhthe popularity of the group is waning

Oh no no no no no nono no not at all I I I just think
that the uh their appeal is becoming more selective

Yeah Now I notice this here youve got this cricket bat here
Yes

Do you play

No I carry this partly of uh I dont know some sort of uh I
suppose whats the worduh

No its going to be that simple beautiful classic

Does look a little bit like you know black leather

You can see yourself in both sides

I feel so bad I feel so bad about this

David David every every movie in every cinema is about death
death sells
I think hes right there is something about this thats thats
so black its like How much more black could this be

and the answer is None none more black

I think like youve like rationalizing this whole thing like
into something you did on on purpose I think were stuck with a
very very stupid and a very and a very dismal looking album

this is depressing

Nigel David
David This is something you wear around your arm you dont put this on

David and Jeanine interview

David Before I met Jeanine my life was cosmically in shambles
it was ahI was using bits and pieces of whatever Eastern
philosophies happened to drift through my transom and she
sort of sorted it out for me straightened it out for me
gave me a path you know a path to follow

Marty I wonder if you have as much influence over his musical

expression

Jeanine Oh yeah I mean listen to him when hes experimenting and
things like that dont I Hes he plays things to me
sometimes when hes worked up and hes got a new bit he
wants to tell me about you know and I say Yeahthats good or
thats bad or thats shit or whatever you know

I hate to keep harping on this but I think that the notion of a
black album has really cursed us in a way

Believe me were getting some very substantial reports of airplay
I dont think we have to worry about that

You know it might have been better if the uh album had been
mixed right

Well I suppose you could cry about that of course its true

I mean its true

It wasntit was mixed all wrong wasnt it
It was mixed wrong
Yeah

Were you there
»you couldnt hear the
How do you know it was mixed wrong
But shesshes heard theshes heard the record
No but Ive heard the album
So youre judgement is that it was mixed wrong
You couldnt hear the lyrics all over it
You dont agree that you cant hear the vocals
No I dont I do not agree No
Well I think maybe
Its interesting that shes bringing it up
Well shed like to hear the vocals

David Ive yet to hear them Ive yet to hear them

Derek We can take the rational approach we can say

Nigel May I make a suggestion May I make a suggestion Ive got one
other suggestion

David Well lets hear yours Lets hear your suggestion

Nigel Stonehenge Stonehenge Its the best production value weve
ever had on stage

David But we havent got the equipment We havent got the equipment

Nigel Not yet we dont Lets start

David We havent got

Nigel Please please just a moment Musically musically we all know it

Tan We know it worksI dont think its a bad idea

Nigel Musically we all know it Right No problems musically We go
right on stage And its quite simple This is you knowIan can
take care of this

David I know what the Stonehenge monument looks like We dont have
that piece of scenery anymore

Nigel I know so we build a new one And this is it look

Tan Considerconsider it done

David So youre just going to take care of it like that Youre going
to find someone to design itusing that as a plan

Tan Lets try Lets try

I do not for one think that the problem was that the band was
down I think that the problem may have beenthat there was a
Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being
crushed by a dwarf Alright That tended to understate

the hugeness of the object

I really think youre just making a much too big thing out of it
Making a big thing out of it wouldve been a good idea

Nigel gave me a drawing that said eighteen inches Alright

I know he did and thats what Im talking about

Now whether he knows the difference between feet and inches is not
my problem I do what Im told

But youre not as confused as him are you I mean its not your
job to be as confused as Nigel is

Its my job to do what Im asked to do by the creative element of
this band And thats what I did Cmon

The audience were laughing

So it became a comedy number

Yes it did Yes it fucking well did and it was not pleasant to
be part of the comedy on stage Backstage perhaps it was very
amusing

Maybe we just fix the choreography Keep the dwarf clear

What do you mean

So they wont trod upon it

I dont think thats the issue I think its symptomatic that
maybe youre taking on more than you canuhuhuhhandle
Its not exactly the first time youve messed things up is it

I mean theres been some uh gaping holes in the business end
If thisif this uh

Not the first timejust a minute Excuse me This is a band
meeting Right Are you here for some reason

Dont worry about it Dont worry about it Shes shes with me
No but is she now in the band Is she singing backup or
something

Hey dont knock at me Dont knock at me

I mean its just a problem you know It gets solved

If it got solved that would be alright but it doesnt get
solved I mean what do you think happend out there What got
solved tonight
For one thing that goes wrongoneone single thing that
goes wrong a hundred things go right Do you know what I spend

my time doing I sleep two or three hours a night Theres no sex

and drugs for Ian David Do you know what I do I find lost
luggage I locate mandolin strings in the middle of Austin
Yes Weve seen you Weve seen you do that

You know I prise the rent out of the local Hebrews Thats what
I do

Well maybe you should get someone else to find the lost
luggage and you should concentrate on whats going on on stage
Yes yes Thats what were talking about

You mean you want me to be the road manager

All badNo all bad bauh could we

What Dave is trying to say if youd let him get a word
through isyou could maybedo with some help

Some help

managing the band

Its very simple its very simple

Its that clear

Maybe theres someone already in the organization We dont
have to pay insurance We dont have to pay extra room etc
Since shes already here shes already among us and uh

e canshe is certainly capable of taking over

e She Wait a minute Wait a minute

ell who do you think Im talking about Who do you think Im
alking about

er you were talking about

y not

am offering to help out here

o youre not offering to help out Youre offering to co-manage
e band with me Is that it

ABZHSTDHA Snow

Jeanine Yes

In so many words that is exactly it

Exactly

Im certainly not going to co-manage with somesomesome girl
just because shes your girlfriend

Dont call her my girlfriend

kids I dont know what youre doing managing a band

Why dont we just

Interview in storeroom II

Marty How would you characterize your relationship with David over the
years Has it changed in any way

Nigel Not really I mean you know they go weve grown up but really

s office

Were very lucky in the sense that weve got two visionaries in the
band

Right

David and Nigel are both like uh like poets you know like
Shelley or Byron or people like that The two totally distinct
types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically you see and
I feel my role in the band is to be kind of in the middle

of that kind of like lukewarm water in a sense

Listen I dont think youve got time to go to the hotel I think
we better go straight to the base

To the what

Base

The gig

To the Civic Arena right

These haircuts wouldnt pass military muster believe me Although
I shouldnt talk I my hairs getting a little shaggy too better

--- Spinal Tap performs Sex Farm ---

He totally ruined the gig there He walks off and then you know
he cant be expected to sit home and get money weve got to get
someone else in there

lobby

Has he ever done this before Has he ever

well no

-quit the band before

No but itsyouve got to understand that like in the world of

rock and roll there are certain changes that sometimes occur

and youve just got to sort of roll with them you know

I mean you read you read you saw exactly how many people
whos been in the band over the years 37 peoples been in this
band over the years I mean Its like you know six months

from now I cant see myself missing Nigel more than I might miss
Ross McLochness or Ronnie Pudding or Danny Upham or Little
Danny Schindler or any of those you know its

I cantI cant believe it I cant believe it you

know that youre lumping Nigel in with uh you know these people
youve played with for a short period of time

Well Im sure Id feel much worse if I werent under such heavy
sedation but still in all I mean youve got to be realistic
about this sort of thing you know

So what happens to the band now

What do you mean

Hes not coming back or

No we we shant work together again

and Amusement Park Stockton California

Oh no I told them once I told them a hundred times
put Spinal Tap first and Puppet show last

Its a morale builder isnt it

Weve got a big dressing room though

What

Got a big dressing room here

Oh weve got a bigger dressing room than the puppets Oh
thats refreshing
Viv Ive got some of this Mendocino Rocket Fuel thats supposed
to be really

David Can you playexcuse me Viv can you play a bassline uh like
Nigel used to do on Big Bottom can you double that You recall

End of Tour Party Los Angeles

Reporter So tonights the last show of the tour Hows that feel You
know is like this your last waltz are we talkin the end
of Spinal Tap or are you gonna try to milk it for a
few more years in Europe I mean

David Well I dont I dont really think that the end can be
assesseduh as of itself as being the end because what
does the end feel like its like saying when you try to
extrapolate the end of the universe you say theif the
universe is indeed infinite then how what does that mean
How far is is tis all the way and then if it stops whats
stoppin it and whats behind whats stoppin it so whats
the end you know is myquestion to you

Guy Sa good crowd Good crowd
Jeanine It is isnt it
Guy Yeah it really is I mean you know some of these things just

you know dont mean much
Jeanine It was hard to get at the last minute you know you cant
arrange it all overnight

be clear anyway

Were anything but racists

You know weve grown musicallyI mean listen to some of
the rubbish we did early on it was stupid

sophisticated view of the idea of sex you know and music-

If I were to ask you what your philosophy of life or your creed
what would that be

Havea goodtimeall the time Thats my philosophy Marty

makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesnt
believe anything

Welllike personally I like to think about sex and drugs
and rocknroll you know thats my life

Yeah
