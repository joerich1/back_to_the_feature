INT LIPSKY’S WEST END AVE APTLIVING ROOMOFFICE - NYC -
2008 - NIGHT

A bright unpretentious two-bedroom in a pre-war building
cluttered with books and papers reflecting its owner’s
lively mind The decor is that of a perennial grad student’s
digs the bachelor pad of a New York intellectual

A dog curled up on the sofa beside him DAVID LIPSKY a
boyishly handsome forty-three quick-witted tightly-wound
smokes and types speedily from scraps of handwritten notes
surrounded by books on his current journalistic subject
climate change A stack of copies of his recent publishing
success - Absolutely American - looms nearby

His iPhone vibrates He gets up and answers the call

LIPSKY
Hey Bob what’s up

BOB’S VOICE
(over phone) Listen According to
this unconfirmed report David
Wallace is dead

LIPSKY
(disputing) What No no no no must
be a college prank or something

Lipsky rapidly googles “david foster wallace death” and scans
the news

BOBS VOICE
I thought if anybody knew whether it
was true or not

Shock registers on Lipsky’s face OVER NPR reporter ROBERT

INT NPR - NYC - 2008 - MOMENTS LATER

Lipsky wearing headphones heart pounding nervously waits
for a cue from a woman producer in the control booth

ROBERT SIEGEL (0S)
-Writer David Lipsky has this
appreciation

The producer signals to Lipsky who reads his prepared
remarks from his shaky hands

LIPSKY
“To read David Foster Wallace was to
feel your eyelids pulled open

EXT BOOKSTORE - NYC - 2008 - DAY

Lipsky pensive smoking walks down the street on a crisp
autumn day stops at a window display honoring Wallace with
his picture and copies of his books The Broom of the System
Brief Interviews with Hideous Men A Supposedly Fun Thing
Ill Never Do Again and his magnum opus Infinite Jest

Lipsky rummages closet shelves until he locates a particular
shoe box labeled “DFW” He opens the box inside are a
motley bunch of audio tapes - eight or nine of them -
numbered scrawled with dates from four days in March 1996

LIPSKY (VO)
-cutting through our sleepy
aquarium our standard TV stores
political campaigns Writers who can
do this like Salinger and Fitzgerald
forge an unbreakable bond with
readers

state-of-the-art back in 1996 It doesn’t play He removes
its batteries and looks in drawers for new ones No luck

DAY

Lipsky takes the batteries out of his electric toothbrush and
puts them in the recorder

LIPSKY (VO)
You didn’t slip into the books looking
for story information but for a
particular experience The sensation
for a certain number of pages of
being David Foster Wallace”

With a mixture of excitement and trepidation he inserts
cassette 1 in the machine and presses play The sound of
David’s voice mid-tape is both comforting and moving

DAVID’S VOICE
(on the recording) -- there was if
anything a conscious attempt to not
give overt direction Although of
course you end up becoming yourself

LIPSKY’S VOICE
(on the recording) Did they want you
to be a writer

was like a really serious jock

city-wide football as a kid I was
real big really strong as a kid And
then for four or five years I was
gonna be a pro tennis player My great
dream Reading was just kind of fun A
weird thing that I did on the side -

Lipsky stops and presses rewind on the tape player He
ruminates as we HEAR the whir of the tape rewinding

FLASHBACK TO
EXT DOWNTOWN SKYLINE - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 10

The heart-stopping view of the illuminated twin towers tells
us we are in pre-2001 New York

INT BOOK SHOP - UPPER WEST SIDE - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 11

Lipsky stands before a paltry turnout - consisting of old
people and a few loyal friends (among them his pretty
girlfriend SARAH) - reading from his novel The Art Fair
Here Lipsky is 30 years old but looks like a student his
long dark Byronic hair framing his fine features

LIPSKY (CONTD)
- the warehouses the old buildings
the cobbled streets

Distracted by disinterested CUSTOMERS who continue to browse
Lipsky hears a muffled giggle and sees a YOUNG COUPLE in the
audience flirting and clearly not listening

LIPSKY (CONTD)
It wasn’t the Upper East Side and it
was dirty I felt marooned Our
mother had taken us off the track of
the nice life we’d been on Shed
moored us in a creepy cul-de-sac with
her art-world friends

EXTINT KGB BAR - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 14

Deafening music A crowded noisy gathering of mostly young
cool black-attired New York writers and artists

LIPSKY (VO) (CONTD)
None of the kids in my school had
parents in the art world It made me
feel different Like there was
something I had to cover up”

Lipsky gets two glasses of wine from a bar We FOLLOW as he
makes his way through the crowd He knows a lot of people
with whom he exchanges ad-libbed greetings along the way
They have to SHOUT to be heard above the din
BEARDED GUY
David hi How’d your reading go

LIPSKY
Great

BEARDED GUY
Sorry I missed it

LIPSKY
Don’t worry about it

Drinks held aloft Lipsky continues into the crowd A MODEL

MODEL
I heard you got the Rolling Stone job

LIPSKY
Well see I’m sort of on probation

Lipsky delivers the drink to Sarah who stands in a circle of
acquaintances in mid-conversation

SARAHS FRIEND

Magazine The guy’s been fucking

canonized

NIGHT

Lipsky at the bathroom door reads aloud Walter Kirn’s
review in New York magazine Sarah comes out ina
towel and he follows her to the bedroom

LIPSKY
“Next year’s book awards have been
decided” Can you believe this “The
plaques and citations can now be put
into escrow” Unbelievable “With
Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace -
a plutonium-dense satirical whiz-kid
opus that runs to almost a thousand
pages -

She kisses him as she goes past

LIPSKY (CONTD)
- (not including footnotes) - the
competition has been obliterated
It’s as though Paul Bunyan had joined
the NFL or Wittgenstein had gone on
Jeopardy The novel is that colossally
disruptive And that spectacularly
good” That’s the fucking opening
paragraph

SARAH
What if it actually is that good You
know You may just have to read it

INT LIPSKY’S W 77TH ST APTLIVING ROOM - NYC - 1996 - DUSK

If his 2008 place is grad-student-y the 1996 Lipsky

teenager’s domain We find Sarah on the couch reading the
current bestseller Primary Colors and Lipsky beside her
reading Infinite Jest Silence

editor BOB LEVIN 40 greying bearded

LIPSKY
How many times have we interviewed a
writer in the last ten years Guess

BOB
Um how many

LIPSKY
Zero I checked

BOB
Maybe that’s because Rolling Stone
doesn’t interview writers

LIPSKY
There hasn’t been a writer like this
one Once in a generation maybe
Hemingway Pynchon Let me have this
story

BOB
What story

Lipsky tosses Newsweek opened to a photo of Wallace onto

Where are you

LIPSKY

I think I may have made a wrong turn
somewhere Let’s see I’m on County

Your publicist sent it in her e-mail
just in case

Stormy skies Flat wintry terrain As the car pulls up
Lipsky sees through the windshield a modest one-story
brick house in the distance and a man emerging from it

From Lipsky’s long shot POV DAVID FOSTER WALLACE hands
shoved in his jeans pockets for warmth accompanied by his
two barking rambunctious black labs JEEVES and DRONE

Lipsky parks He takes a deep bracing breath before getting
out of the car to finally meet the man about whom he has
complicated feelings He walks toward him
This is the first time we see David up close and in focus
stubble long hair blue bandanna wire-rims Frye boots
6’2” and at this time in his life burly

DAVID
You made it

LIPSKY
Yeah Hi

David offers his wary tolerant hand This being the end of
his tour his patience is frayed and he’s just about talked
out But at the same time it’s Rolling Stone he wants to
make a good impression

DAVID
Dave Dave Wallace

LIPSKY
David Lipsky Pleasure

Lipsky is cowed but determined to hold his own These are
two really smart competitive guys out to impress each other
Wallace wants to be favorably profiled and Lipsky wants
Wallace’s approval - and a good story

LIPSKY
Sorry about the phone call

DAVID
95 joke

Lipsky laughs

DAVID (CONTD)
Sorry in advance about the dogs gonna
be slobbering all over you

LIPSKY
Oh I don’t mind I love dogs

DAVID

Yeah Well you haven’t met these
guys It’s cold let’s go inside
(to the dogs) Jeeves Drone Get over
here

Lipsky follows David and the rowdy barking dogs into the
house

INT DAVIDS HOUSELIVING ROOMKITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS 28

Lipsky drops his bag on the messy shit-stained shag carpet
The dogs are indeed all over him Lipsky scratches their
heads and speaks to them as a dog lover would speak to dogs

LIPSKY
Yes I’m very glad to meet you too
Who are you

DAVID
That’s Jeeves The Jeevesmeister I
got him ‘cause he was so ugly No one
else wanted him Now he’s like a
Cover Girl-dog Aren’t you Jeeves
Yes you are And this is Drone My
provisional dog

LIPSKY
Why provisional

DAVID
Just showed up one day while Jeeves
and I were out jogging and the rest is
history
(A beat)
I feel like I should offer you tea or
something

LIPSKY
Yeah Thanks That would be great

David goes to put on water We STAY on Lipsky casually
studying the room with the eye of a journalist taking in the
grad-student-like accoutrements cramped cinder-block
bookshelves hodgepodge of furniture an ALANIS MORISSETTE
POSTER conspicuously on the wall Lipsky glancing out the
window at the wintry landscape raises his voice to converse
with David who’s in the kitchen

LIPSKY
Nice view

DAVID (0S)
Thank you I can’t take credit for it

Lipsky smiles Pause

LIPSKY
So Have you always been unlisted

DAVID
(from the kitchen) I had to do that
recently It was getting crazy
LIPSKY
Because of fans

DAVID
I don’t know if “fan” would be the
right word I think what happened
was I had forgotten to tell my
parents not to give my number out So
it was people who tracked my parents
down and um —-

LIPSKY
(knowing) Ohhh

DAVID
I have this terrible problem I just
really hate to hurt people’s feelings
So I did something kinda cowardly

LIPSKY
Unlisting your number’s not cowardly

DAVID
It kinda is I mean I changed my
number so these folks couldn’t find me
anymore There was this computer
operator in Vancouver lived ina
basement Who I found really moving
In terrible terrible pain

LIPSKY
What did he want from you

DAVID
Wasn’t clear and when I would sort of
ask him he’d get angry and that’s
when it got scary

Lipsky sees a child’s drawing displayed on the fridge

“Chickenhead Dave Wallace”

LIPSKY

(re the drawing) Who’s the artist
DAVID

Hm (Lipsky points) Oh my friend’s

daughter Calls me Chickenhead and I
call her Chickenhead Her latest
salvo in the war

Laughing Lipsky takes out his tape recorder and starts to

set it up but stops

(Lipsky is a nervous laugher he laughs

alot not only where indicated)

LIPSKY
You mind if I

DAVID
Hey Do what you’ve got to do

David watches uncomfortably The ever-present tape recorder

becomes a third character in this conversation

DAVID
Listen Before we start putting stuff
on tape I gotta ask you something

LIPSKY
Okay

DAVID
I need to know that anything that I
ask you five minutes later to not put
in you won’t put in

LIPSKY
Absolutely

He clicks off the recorder
DAVID
Given my level of fatigue and fuck-up
quotient lately it’s the only way I
can see doin’ it and not going crazy

LIPSKY
I understand completely

Lipsky presses play

DAVID
Right back on huh

LIPSKY
You agreed to the interview

IE CARMAIN STREET - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY

LIPSKY
You like teaching there

DAVID
Yeah I do very much that’s what’s
so fucked I feel so bad for these
kids

LIPSKY
Why do you feel bad them they have
the best writing teacher in the world

DAVID
If I were there maybe The whole
fuss has taken me out of school for
the past two weeks and I’m gonna have
to leave again tomorrow We’ve got to
get up at the crack of dawn to leave
for the airport by the way

LIPSKY
Oh shit do we really

“on” and his students are eating it up

A campus romance story I gotta tell

eyes met over the keg”

EARNEST STUDENT
I just want my narrator to be funny

LIPSKY
Ill have the same

WAITER
I’1l be right back with your pop

The waiter goes Lipsky sets up the tape recorder Pause

LIPSKY
You don’t drink

David doesn’t answer right away

DAVID
Is that a question

LIPSKY
It’s an observation

DAVID
Ah I see No I do not drink You
can order whatever you want go right
ahead

LIPSKY
That’s all right My friends who have
been through the program say they
didnt want people to drink in front
of them so out of respect

DAVID

Im not any sort of authority on any
sort of “program” But from my very
limited outside understanding people
who have been in it for a while you
could snort cocaine off the back of
your hand and they’re okay

Lipsky is embarrassed for having been presumptuous

DAVID

You know what I would love to do
LIPSKY

What
DAVID

I would love to do a profile of one of
you guys who’s doin’ a profile of me

LIPSKY
That is interesting

DAVID
Too po-mo and cute
LIPSKY
Maybe for Rolling Stone
DAVID
But it would be interesting
(A beat)
I’m sorry
LIPSKY

What’s wrong

DAVID

It’s just you’re gonna go back to New
York and sit at your desk and shape
this thing however you want And that
to me is extremely disturbing

LIPSKY
Why is it disturbing

DAVID
‘Cause I would like to shape the
impression of me that’s coming across
I can’t even tell if I like you yet
‘cause I’m too worried whether you
like me

Before Lipsky can assure him the waiter brings their sodas

WAITER
(handing off the sodas)
Here you go Your food will be out
soon Can I get you anything else

LIPSKY
We’re fine thanks

The waiter goes

DAVID
So what’s this piece about What does
“Jann” want

LIPSKY
What’s it like being the most-talked
about writer in the country That
sort of thing That sounds so --

Lipsky seems embarrassed as soon as he says the words

DAVID

How do you learn to do this stuff
LIPSKY

What
DAVID

Interviewing Did you go to
interviewing school

LIPSKY
No I uh

A beat lLipsky feels a tad fraudulent to identify himself as
a writer to the man whose success and talent he envies

LIPSKY
I’m a writer

DAVID
Oh yeah

LIPSKY

I mean I write fiction Just published
my first novel as a matter of fact

DAVID
What’s it called

LIPSKY
The Art Fair

David shrugs He’s never heard of it Lipsky feels foolish
for having brought it up

LIPSKY
And I uh had a collection published
a couple of years ago

Lipsky’s pumping leg betrays his anxiety David notices

DAVID
You’re a nervous guy aren’t you

LIPSKY
No no I’m okay How are you

DAVID
‘Cause I’m terrified

LIPSKY
Are you I think it’s going to be a
lot of fun
33D INT RESTAURANTTABLE - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - LATER
The food is decimated David is loosening up

DAVID
The thing about this tour is I
would like to get laid out of ita
couple of times but Like people
come up they kinda slither up during
readings or whatever But it seems
like what I want is not to have to
take any action

LIPSKY
Like

DAVID

Like I don’t want to have to say

“Would you like to come back to my

hotel” I want them to say “I am

coming back to the hotel Where is
your hotel”

Lipsky laughs

DAVID
I can’t stand to look like I’m
actively trading on this sexually
Which of course I would be happy to
do In retrospect it was lucky that
I didn’t

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
Basically it just would have made me
feel lonely

LIPSKY
Why lonely

DAVID

Because it wouldn’t have had anything
to do with me it would have just
been

LIPSKY
Your fame

DAVID
Yeah Whatever

LIPSKY

You’re famous You can say that
Except if they’re responding to
your work and the work is so
personal then trading on it is
actually another way of meeting you

isn’t that right

A beat David is impressed

DAVID
That is so good

LIPSKY
Thank you

DAVID

by Lipsky’s analysis

This piece’1ll really be good if it’s

mostly you Talk

all you want man

save me a whole lotta trouble

So this is what a real car feels like
The one I have is like riding a power

LIPSKY
You think being handsome has anything
to do with your success

DAVID
(incredulously) What

LIPSKY
You are photogenic You look good in
your author’s photo

DAVID
Youd have to come put me down if I
even start thinking that way

LIPSKY
Thinking what way About how books
are sold

DAVID
Like “Do you want to do a Rolling
Stone interview do you want to do xX
do you want to do Y” worries me that
what I’m doing right now is being a
whore

LIPSKY
A whore Why

DAVID
You know cashing in somehow or
getting some little celebrity for
myself That will from some bizarre
set of misunderstandings sell more
copies of the book

LIPSKY
Right

DAVID
You can quote that Preferably in a
context where I don’t sound like a
total dweeb
(A beat)
By the way are they gonna send Annie
Leibovitz to take pictures

LIPSKY
I’m not sure Possibly

DAVID
I know Youre a good-looking guy We
should have ‘em photograph you and
say you’re me Maybe I’11 finally end
up getting laid

You don’t have to pay for my shit

It’s not coming out of my pocket
I’ve got an expense account

DAVID
All right if you insist

David goes back for more
INT CARCOMMERCIAL DRAG - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT

Riding through town the Davids are eating candy like
teenagers on a joyride

DAVID
If you ate this stuff all the time
what would be wrong with that

LIPSKY
Except for your teeth falling out and
getting really fat

DAVID
Yeah it doesn’t have any of the
nourishment of real food but it’s
real pleasurable masticating and
swallowing this stuff

LIPSKY
Like seductive commercial
entertainment

DAVID
Exactly and what saves us is that
most commercial entertainment isn’t
very good

LIPSKY
What about good seductive commercial
entertainment - like Die Hard

DAVID
The first Die Hard Great film

LIPSKY
Brilliant right

DAVID
The best

EXT DAVID’S HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT

The car pulls up parks They get out with the spoils from
the 7-Eleven Mid-discourse

DAVID
So if the book’s about anything it’s
about the question of Why am I
watching all this shit It’s not
about the shit it’s about me Why am
I doing it And what’s so American
about what I’m doing

We hear the dogs barking as David unlocks the door and they
enter the house

INT DAVID’S HOUSELIVING ROOMKITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS

The dogs run out to do their thing David puts away the soda
and snacks

DAVID
The minute I start talking about this
stuff it sounds number one very
vague And two really reductive

LIPSKY
I don’t think you’re being reductive
or vague at all

DAVID
Because it’s like I don’t have a
diagnosis a system of prescriptions
You know Like why are we - and by
“we” I mean people like you and me
mostly white upper middle class
obscenely well-educated doing really
interesting jobs sitting in really
expensive chairs watching the best
most sophisticated electronic
equipment money can buy - why do we
feel empty and unhappy

LIPSKY
Kinda like Hamlet With channel-
surfing

DAVID

I’m not saying TV is bad or a waste of
your time Any more than you know
masturbation is bad or a waste of your
time Its a pleasurable way to spend
a few minutes But if youre doing it
twenty times a day if your primary
sexual relationship is with your own
hand then theres something wrong

LIPSKY
At least with masturbation some
action has been performed though
right

DAVID
All right you could make me look like
a real dick if you print this Yes
youre performing muscular movements
with your hand as youre jerking off
But what youre doing is running a
movie in your head and having a
fantasy relationship with somebody who
isnt real in order to stimulate a
purely neurological response
Look as the Internet grows in the
next ten fifteen years and virtual
reality pornography becomes a reality
were gonna have to develop some
machinery inside our guts to help us
turn off pure unalloyed pleasure
Otherwise I don’t know about you but
I’m gonna have to leave the planet

LIPSKY
(smiles uncertainly) Why

DAVID
Because the technology is just gonna
get better and better And its gonna
get easier and easier and more and
more convenient and more and more
pleasurable to be alone with images
on a screen given to us by people who
do not love us but want our money
Which is fine In low doses But if
thats the basic main staple of your
diet Youre gonna die Ina
meaningful way youre going to die

Silence Lipsky mulls over the gravity of what David has
said David breaks the portentous silence when he pops a wad
of tobacco in his mouth

LIPSKY
Can I try that
DAVID
Be my guest It takes some getting

used to

Lipsky tries it and makes a horrible face David laughs

LIPSKY
You mind if I use your uh

Amused David points the way to the bathroom

DAVID
I believe it’s unoccupied

Lipsky goes leaving the tape running
INT DAVID’S HOUSEBATHROOM - 1996 - CONTINUOUS 39

Lipsky spits the tobacco into the sink He cups his hands
under the running water and rinses his mouth He looks at
himself in the mirror and takes a deep fortifying breath

He stealthily opens the medicine cabinet and finds it stocked
with jars of vitamins Stri-Dex pads and tubes of Topol
toothpaste for smokers He jots down notes

LIPSKY

Do you not have a TV
DAVID

I do not have a TV
LIPSKY

How come
DAVID

‘Cause if I had a TV Id watch it all
the time I don’t even know if I would
watch it it would be on all the time -
my version of a fireplace A source
of warmth and light in the corner that
I would occasionally get sucked into

LIPSKY
Did you watch a lot of TV when you
were a kid

DAVID
Yeah A lot You
LIPSKY
Me Yeah I did I moved in with a
woman who grew up without a
television and living with her the
first month was torture and then I
realized it was probably the best
thing for me

DAVID
Did you guys stay together
LIPSKY
It’s complicated
DAVID
Why
LIPSKY

I was seeing this woman then she
moved to LA and we theoretically
broke up And I started seeing this
ther woman but then I started seeing
he first woman again - trying the bi-
oastal thing - and the second

ell let’s just say she hasn’t taken
t very well

bea cto

DAVID

t’s so much easier having dogs You
on’t get laid but you also don’t get
he feeling you’re hurting their
eelings all the time I emphasize
trictly platonic relationship with
the dogs

Qt OH

LIPSKY
You’re not dating anyone

DAVID
Seriously dating No I’m out of
practice I wouldn’t know what to say

LIPSKY
You want to have kids

DAVID
Yeah I think someday I do do you

LIPSKY
Yeah Eventually I think

DAVID
Writing books is kinda like raising
children but you gotta be careful
you should take pride in the work but
it’s bad to want that glory to reflect
back on you

LIPSKY
You worry about having children

David seems far away this is difficult for him After a
beat he speaks sounding vulnerable which doesn’t go
unnoticed by Lipsky

DAVID
I don’t know that I want to say
anything more about it - okay

LIPSKY
(prepared to back off) That’s fine

DAVID
I mean we can joke about getting laid
on tour and stuff but

LIPSKY

I just thought it’d be nice to have
someone to be sharing all this
wonderful stuff with

DAVID
Yeah I really have wished I was
married the last couple of weeks

LIPSKY
You have

DAVID

Yeah because nobody quite gets it
Your friends who aren’t in the writing
biz are all just awed by your picture
in Time and your agent and editor are
good people but they have their own
agendas It’s fun talking to you
about it but youve got an agenda
too and a set of interests that
diverges from mine

LIPSKY
That’s true

DAVID
There’s something nice about having
somebody who kinda shared your life
and that you could allow yourself just
to be happy and confused with

LIPSKY
Somebody you can call when you get
back to the hotel

DAVID
Uh huh (A beat) So why aren’t you
married at thirty
LIPSKY
Why arent you married at thirty-four
DAVID
You first
LIPSKY

Okay Um I think its hard to cast
that role to fill it when you know
its for thirty or forty years
someone who whatever mental landscape
youre in theyre going to be in it
too you need someone wholl fit any
landscape you can imagine

DAVID
Well I cant put it as well as you
did about the “mental landscapes” I
just know Im hard to be around

Davids “mental landscapes” reference competitive fawning
mocking Lipsky isn’t sure

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
Because when I want to be by myself
like to work I really want to be by
myself I think if you dedicate
yourself to anything one facet of
that is that it makes you very very
self-conscious You end up using
people Wanting them around when you
want them around but then sending
them away

LIPSKY
Comes with the territory though
doesn’t it Self-consciousness
DAVID
There’s good self-consciousness And
then there’s this toxic paralyzing
raped-by-psychic-Bedouins self-
consciousness

Lipsky laughs

LIPSKY

(re Alanis poster)
Can you do me a favor Can you tell
me about that poster over there

DAVID
Alanis I don’t know I guess Im
susceptible like everybody else Why

LIPSKY
She’s pretty alright

DAVID

Yeah but in a very sloppy very human
way That squeaky orgasmic quality
in her voice Here’s what it is A
lot of women in magazines are pretty
in a way that isn’t erotic because
they don’t look like anybody you know

LIPSKY
True

DAVID
You can’t imagine them putting a
quarter in a parking meter or eating a
bologna sandwich But her I don’t
know I just find her absolutely
riveting

LIPSKY
How’d you get to know her her music
I mean

DAVID
Listening to cheesy Bloomington radio
and “I Want to Tell You” came on

LIPSKY
(correcting him) “You Oughta Know”

DAVID
What

LIPSKY
“I Want to Tell You” is the book 0OJ
Simpson wrote

DAVID
Oh right

LIPSKY

Wouldn’t it be great if OJ Simpson
sang “You Oughta Know” and Alanis
Morissette wrote a book about not
killing two people

They laugh Lipsky is pleased to make David laugh

DAVID
If somehow this whole fuss could get
me even like a five-minute cup of tea
with her

LIPSKY
Why don’t you put out feelers see if
shed be willing to meet you

DAVID
You serious I would never do that
LIPSKY
Why not
DAVID
Id be too terrified Why you would
do that
LIPSKY

If I were you Why not

DAVID

A date with Alanis Morissette What
would I say to her “Hello Miss
Morissette What is it like to be

you” (gruff voice) “I don’t know -
shut up And get the fuck away from
me”

LIPSKY

But you’d go if she called “Hey
Dave I’m at the Drake in Chicago
Let’s have that tea”

DAVID
Yeah except this is gonna look
ridiculous like I’m using Rolling
Stone as a vehicle to like -

LIPSKY
It’s been used for worse
DAVID
Yes I would do it I’d go ina

heartbeat
As Lipsky cracks up David paints the picture

DAVID
Perspiring heavily all the way up
there shoving Certs into my mouth
Goin’ nuts It would cost me like a
week of absolute trauma But yeah I
would do it in a heartbeat

David realizes the late hour
DAVID (CONTD)
Look I like I like talking to you

but we have to get up real early

lost track of time When should I
pick you up in the morning

There’s a Mitsubishi plant and
then there’s a lot of farm-support
stuff like Ro-Tech Anderson Seeds

aren’t you in New York

Every time I go to New York I get
caught up in this - there’s this
enormous hiss of egos at various
stages of inflation and deflation
It’s me-me-me

Lipsky takes out his tape recorder
LIPSKY
So I gotta ask What’s with the

bandanna

DAVID
What What do you mean

LIPSKY

People think it’s a way you’re trying
to connect with the younger reading
audience

DAVID
Is that what people think I don’t
know many Gen-Xers who wear ‘em
Jeez I don’t know what to say I
guess I wish you hadn’t brought this

up

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
Because now I’m worrying that it’s
going to seem intentional Like if I
dont wear it am I not wearing it
because I’m bowing to other people’s
perception that it’s a commercial
choice Or do I do what I want even
though it’s perceived as commercial -
and it’s just like one more crazy
circle to go around

LIPSKY
Sorry When did you start wearing
them

DAVID

In Tuscon It was a hundred degrees
all the time I would perspire so
much I would drip into the electric
typewriter I was nervous I was gonna
give myself a shock And then I
discovered that I felt better with
them on

LIPSKY
Uh huh

DAVID
I know it’s a security blanket for me -
whenever I’m nervous Or feel like I
have to keep myself together It
makes me feel kinda creepy that people
view it as an affectation or a
trademark or something It’s more of
a foible the recognition of a
weakness that I’m kinda afraid my
head’s gonna explode

Lipsky laughs

Never before

DAVID
I think I started a World War Two

What about

DAVID

A bunch of people with strangely
hyperdeveloped skills and powers who
are going to invade Hitlers bunker
Then in college I wrote a couple of
papers for other people

56B

LIPSKY
They were paying you to write their
papers

DAVID

Well I wouldnt put it that coarsely
But lets say there were complicated
systems of reward I’d read two or
three of their papers to learn you
know what their music sounded like
And I remember thinking “Man Im
really good at this Im a weird kind
of forger I mean I can sound kind of
like anybody”

Crap jobs Let’s see I was a security
guard for this software company for
three and a half months

LIPSKY
Really

DAVID
I had to wear this polyester uniform
and walk under these fluorescent
lights twirlin’ my baton checking in
every ten minutes mimes a walkie-
talkie “All clear at this cubicle”
Like every bad 60s novel about
meaningless authority

LIPSKY
And were you thinking “My God I had
two books come out when I was in my
early twenties and here I am”

DAVID
No As a matter of fact one reason I
liked that job is I walked around not
thinking In a really like “Huh
theres a ceiling tile”

LIPSKY
And after the security guard thing

DAVID
This is the worst I worked as a towel
boy at this chichi health club

LIPSKY
A “towel boy”

DAVID

They called me something other than a
towel boy but I was in effect a towel
boy Who every once in a while was
entrusted with the job of checking
people in having them show their id

LIPSKY
Uh huh

DAVID
Anyway Im sitting there and who
should walk in to get their towel but
this guy this writer I knew
Who received a Whiting Writers Award
the same year I had like two years
earlier

LIPSKY
Oh shit

DAVID
So I see this guy that Id been up on
this fucking rostrum with having
Eudora Welty give us this prize -

LIPSKY
Oh God

DAVID
- And two years later Im like Its
the only time Ive literally dived
under something to have somebody
avoid seeing me

LIPSKY
Did you think you were done then

DAVID
Yeah I was pretty sure life was over

LIPSKY
This is after your suicide watch

David blinks A beat

DAVID
How’d you know about that

LIPSKY
I read it somewhere McLean’s right
How long were you there

DAVID
Eight days I think

LIPSKY
Why were you there

DAVID

Mostly cause I was scared I would do
something stupid I had a friend from
high school who tried to kill himself
by sitting in a garage with the car
runnin And what it turned out was
he didnt die but it really fucked up
his brain

And I knew that if anybody was fated
to fuck up a suicide attempt it was
me

LIPSKY
So there you are still in your
twenties

DAVID
My late twenties

LIPSKY

Your late twenties somewhat in pain
about your desire to become a sort of
successful literary person

DAVID
I think probably the not very
sophisticated diagnosis is that I was
depressed Cause by this time my
egos all invested in the writing
Its the only thing that Ive gotten
you know food pellets from the
universe for So I felt really
trapped Like “Uh-oh my five years
is up Ive gotta move on but I dont
want to move on” I was really stuck
And drinking was part of that But it
wasnt that I was stuck because I
drank It was like I really sort of
felt like my life was over at twenty-
eight And that felt really bad and I
didnt wanna feel it So I would do
all kinds of things I mean I would
drink real heavy I would like fuck
strangers Oh God -- Or then for
two weeks I wouldnt drink and Id
run ten miles every morning ina
desperate like very American “I will
fix this somehow by taking radical
action” sort of thing

And here you are promoting this
acclaimed book Not bad

Now that David’s talking about the book Lipsky gives up in
frustration plops into a chair and quietly seethes

LIPSKY
What the fuck was that about

SARAHS VOICE

LIPSKY
You were on the phone with him for
like a half hour

SARAH’S VOICE
It wasn’t a half hour

timed it You were only supposed to
say hello

David still in boxers and Chicago Cubs t-shirt frazzled

EXT HOTEL WHITNEYLOBBY - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 - MORNING

Lipsky and David with his shower-wet hair pinned up find
Patty’s car out front They get in the backseat

PATTY
You’re wearing that

DAVID
For a radio interview Yes

Her disapproval showing she pulls away

INT MINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIOLOBBYCORRIDOR - ST PAUL - 1996
DAY

A pretty PRODUCTION ASSISTANT greets David and Lipsky

DAVID
Hi Dave Dave Wallace

PA
(blushes )
I know who you are

David introduces Lipsky

DAVID
My amanuensis Mr Boswell

The PA shakes Lipsky’s hand playing along with the joke

PA
(in greeting)
“Mr Boswell” Right this way

She leads David followed by Lipsky down a corridor past
glass-walled studios Lipsky sees people recognize David
whisper among themselves Young women smile shyly excited
to be in the presence of a cool celebrity

PA
We record digitally I hope that’s OK

DAVID
So only yes or no answers

She rolls her eyes Lipsky laughs David sees him scribble
in his pad

DAVID
If you do a really mean job I have
twenty years to get you back
Remember that

INT MINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIONPR STUDIO - 1996 - DAY T6A

The interview goes on the air Lipsky observes from outside
the booth The NPR GUY has a good radio voice

NPR GUY
My guest today is David Foster
Wallace who has burst on the literary
scene with his 1079-page three-pound-
three-ounce novel Infinite Jest

Jay McInerney called it “something
like a sleek Vonnegut chassis wrapped
in layers of post-millennial Zola”
David Foster Wallace welcome to our
show

DAVID
Thank you glad to be here

He exchanges looks with Lipsky outside the booth

NPR GUY
You have said that you saw yourself as
- quote - “a combination of being

incredibly shy and being an
egomaniac too”

DAVID
I think I said “exhibitionist also”

NPR GUY
Meaning

David glances at Lipsky

DAVID
Well I think being shy basically
means being self-absorbed to the
extent that it makes it difficult to
be around other people

NPR GUY
Difficult for you or difficult for
the other people

DAVID
I suppose a little bit of both
77 IE PATTYS CARMINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIO - ST PAUL - 1996 - 77
DAY

Patty waits outside her car as the Davids join her

PATTY
That was wonderful I listened to the
whole show So interesting I may
have to buy your book and read it

DAVID
Sorry about that

David and Lipsky climb in

PATTY
So you have the rest of the day free
Where would you like to go

DAVID
Do you know where the Mall of America
is

EI MALL OF AMERICAVARIOUS SHOPS - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY

They discover the vast courts at each corner of the mall
They walk through the amusement park ride a roller coaster
ride a carousel In a mirror maze they make their way
through trying not to bump into the walls They try flight
simulators play mini-golf and walk through the underwater
tunnels of the aquarium They stare blankly at Build-a-Bear
bear parts which stare blankly back at them

INT MALL OF AMERICAFOOD COURT - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY

David and Lipsky sit over lunch the recorder running on the
table between them They watch SHOPPERS

DAVID
I wanted to write something that had
kind of the texture of what life was
like in America right now This
enormous tsunami of stuff comin’ at
you And also - it’s not unfun

LIPSKY
Not at all It is sort of heavy
though I mean weight-wise

DAVID
My friend said when it hit the porch
it sounded like a car bomb going off

LIPSKY
Who are your readers College kids

DAVID

The people who seem most enthusiastic
are young men Which I guess I can
understand - it’s a fairly male book
a fairly nerdy book about loneliness
You can expect that somebody whos
willing to read and read hard a
thousand-page book is gonna be
somebody with some loneliness issues

LIPSKY
You think it’s about loneliness

DAVID
I think if there is sort of a sadness
for people under forty-five or
something it has to do with pleasure
and achievement and entertainment
And a kind of emptiness at heart of
what they thought was going on that
maybe I can hope that parts of the
book will speak to their nerve endings
a little bit

He presses stop on the tape recorder surprising Lipsky

DAVID (CONTD)
By the way if you quote any of this
youd do me a favor if you’d say that
I’m talking about what I hope for the
book or what the book is tryin’ to
do I don’t pretend that it has Okay

LIPSKY
That’s fine

Lipsky presses play

LIPSKY
So the Walter Kirn review in New
York Magazine -

DAVID
Didn’t read it I mean I heard

LIPSKY
“Next year’s book awards have been
decided” kind of thing How’d it feel

DAVID

I applauded his taste and discernment
What do you want me to say How would
you feel about it

LIPSKY
How would I feel That I’d known all
along it was good and here was
someone validating that

DAVID
All I know is this is absolutely the
best I could do between like 1992 and
1995 And if everybody hated it I
wouldn’t be thrilled but I don’t
think I’d be devastated either

It’s like if you’re used to doing
heavy-duty literary stuff that doesn’t
sell well being human animals with
egos we find a way to accommodate
that fact by the following equation
If it sells really well and gets a lot
of attention it must be shit Then
of course the ultimate irony is if
your thing gets a lot of attention and
sells really well then the very
mechanism you’ve used to shore
yourself up when your stuff didn’t
sell well is now part of the Darkness
Nexus when it does so you’re screwed
You can’t win

Lipsky is laughing

A loud explosive action scene from Broken Arrow with John
Travolta and Christian Slater fills the screen

Seated up close their heads craned looking up at the screen
Julie and Betsy sit together and Lipsky monitors Davids
reactions David is an ideal spectator totally engaged with
a child-like guilelessness that Lipsky finds endearing

DAVID
No the guy playing Letterman

JULIE
How do you know him

DAVID
Went to Amherst with him

LIPSKY
Friend of yours

DAVID
I hated his guts

Laughter Lipsky gets up to go to the kitchen which is
visible from the living room

LIPSKY
Does anyone want drinks or anything

JULIE
(calls) There’s also beer

LIPSKY
Soda’s fine thank you

JULIE
(to David) Why did you hate him

DAVID
He was just very cool and popular and
I was not that was the basic offense

Betsy gets something out of her bag and joins Lipsky in the
kitchen

BETSY
Hey

LIPSKY
Hey

BETSY

I brought you something

LIPSKY
You brought me something

She gives him a copy of the Kenyon Review

LIPSKY
Oh great This has your poem in it
Thank you

In the living room David shows Julie the TV listings

DAVID
Look what’s on next Algiers
Starring Hedy Lamarr Have you seen
it

JULIE
Uh no

DAVID
It’s one of the greats And Hedy
Lamarr is fascinating She invented
frequency hopping

David sees Lipsky and Betsy talking and doesn’t like it
Back to the kitchen

LIPSKY
Hey when I get back to New York you
mind if I e-mailed you with questions
about what Dave was like in grad
school and stuff

BETSY
Sure if it’s okay with Dave

LIPSKY
I’m sure it’s fine with Dave Can I
have your e-mail address

BETSY
Sure

She looks for something to write on scribbles her address
and gives it to Lipsky before going back to the living room

A moment later David gets up walks over to Lipsky and
backs him up against the fridge

DAVID
(whispers)
What are you doing

Lipsky initially thinks David is joking
LIPSKY

(smiling)
What
DAVID
I saw you hitting on Betsy

LIPSKY
Hitting on I was talking to her

DAVID
David I saw you You got her to give
you her address

LIPSKY

Her e-mail address In case I had
questions about the piece I am
writing about you

DAVID
Well I don’t want her talking to you

LIPSKY
Fine I won’t contact her

DAVID
I told you she and I dated when we
were in grad school The least you
can do is show me the respect of not
coming on to her right in front of me

LIPSKY
Dave I’m sorry if it looked that way
That was not my intention Besides
why would I want to get involved with
somebody who lives in St Paul

DAVID
Youre already involved with somebody
who lives in Los Angeles

David is glaring at him when we hear

JULIE (0S)
Are you okay
DAVID
(calls)
Everything’s fine Thank you
(to Lipsky)
Just stay away from her Okay Bea
good guy

David goes back to the women

DAVID (0S)

Once he catches his breath Lipsky breaking solidarity with
Davids abstinence gets a beer out of the fridge and
pointedly while making eye contact with David pops open the
can and defiantly takes a slug

Mid-flight David his beaten-up Robert Heinlein paperback

his bandanna’d head leaning against the window Lipsky
studies his sunlit face with new objectivity

EXT OHARE AIRPORTLONG TERM PARKING - CHICAGO - 1996 - DUSK 93

A fresh layer of snow covers every car in the lot making
them indistinguishable from one another David and Lipsky
walk through the rows of cars David carrying his knapsack

They continue to walk up and down the rows of cars looking
for the Grand Am Lipsky repeatedly clicks his key hoping to
have the car announce itself with blinking headlights

Lipsky clicks the key and locates the car Finally They
throw their bags in the trunk and start to get in

LIPSKY
What

DAVID
You didn’t think to write down where
we parked the car

Lipsky is cold feeling vulnerable fighting tears

LIPSKY

No I didn’t okay Sorry I fucked
up I’m a fuck-up Not everyone can
be as brilliant as you

DAVID
What is with you

LIPSKY
What the fuck is with you

They get into the car
INT CAROUTSKIRTS - CHICAGO - 1996 - DAY 94
They ride in silence Lipsky at the wheel collects his

thoughts before speaking his mind This is a more assertive
Lipsky than we’ve seen before

LIPSKY
I gotta say There’s something
basically false about your approach
here

DAVID
What do you mean “false”

LIPSKY
I think it’s part of your whole social
strategy

DAVID
In what way

LIPSKY
You still feel you’re smarter than
other people

DAVID
Oh really

LIPSKY

Yeah but you act like you’re in the
kids’ softball game but holding back
your power-hitting to try to make it
more competitive for the little ones

DAVID
When

LIPSKY
Here now for the past three days
it’s part of your social strategy

DAVID
You’re a tough room you know that

LIPSKY

You make a point of holding back -
there’s something obvious about you
holding back your intelligence to be
with people who are younger or maybe
not as agile as you are

DAVID
That would make me a real asshole
wouldn’t it I don’t think writers
are any smarter than other people I
think they may be more compelling in
their stupidity or in their
confusion
But I think one of the true ways that
I have gotten smarter is I’ve
realized that I’m not much smarter
than other people

LIPSKY
Yeah right

DAVID
There are ways in which other people
are a lot smarter than me Like I
don’t know it makes me feel kinda
lonely

LIPSKY
What

DAVID

There’s certain stuff I’ve told you
that’s really true and frankly I
think it’s been brave of me

LIPSKY
Absolutely

DAVID

I’ve written enough of these “pieces”
to know that you could present this in
a hundred different ways Ninety of
which I’m really gonna come off as a
monumental asshole But it seems like
your read of this is “Huh what an
interesting persona Dave is adopting
for the purposes of this interview”

LIPSKY
That’s not what I’m saying

DAVID

If we’d done this interview through
the mail And I had access to a
library and could look stuff up

My dream would be for you to write
this up send it to me and I get to
rewrite all my quotes - which of
course youll never do When I’m ina
room by myself alone and have enough
time I can be really really smart
Don’t get me wrong I think I’m
bright I think I’m talented I don’t
mean to sound disingenuous

LIPSKY
(amused) Oh no

DAVID
I am not an idiot I mean you know
I can talk intelligently with you
about stuff But I can’t quite keep
up with you

LIPSKY
That is such bullshit

DAVID
Believe me I’m not just “Aw-shucks
I’m just in from the country I’m not
a real writer I’m just a regular
guy” I’m not trying to lay some kind
of shit And I’m -

LIPSKY
You just did it again You flatter
me but are you just being
patronizing

DAVID
I just think to look across the room
and automatically assume that somebody
else is less aware than me or that
somehow their interior life is less
rich and complicated and acutely
perceived than mine makes me not as
good a writer

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
Because that means Im going to be
performing for a faceless audience
instead of trying to have a
conversation with a person If you
think thats faux then you think what
you want Ive got a serious fear of
being a certain way And a set I think
of like real convictions about why
Im continuing to do this why its
worthwhile Why its not just an
exercise in basically getting my dick
sucked And you know what this is a
very clever tactic of yours

LIPSKY
Tactic what tactic

DAVID
Get me a little pissed off a little
less guarded I’m gonna reveal more

Yes its true I treasure my regular-
guy-ness Ive started to think its
my biggest asset as a writer that Im
pretty much just like everybody else
(A beat)
You know what I’m not doing any kind
of faux thing with you Im not gonna
say it again

LIPSKY
Okay but the faux thing - what you
just said - is an example of the faux
thing You dont want to take the
risk of giving the full you

DAVID
Look I don’t know if you’re a very
nice man or not It’s very clear that
you don’t believe a word I’ve said

LIPSKY
All your protesting “I’m just a
regular guy” You don’t crack open a

thousand-page book ‘cause you heard
the author’s a regular guy You read
it because the author is brilliant
Because you want him to be brilliant
So who the fuck are you kidding

DAVID
I don’t have the brain cells left to
play any kind of “faux” games with
you

LIPSKY
Fine

David presses stop on the tape recorder

EXT HIGHWAYGAS STATION - CENTRAL ILLINOIS - 1996 -
AFTERNOON

In nasty weather Lipsky fills the tank leaving the cap on
the roof David runs around to the other side of the car to
take over driving duty from Lipsky They drive away

IE CAROUTSKIRTS - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - AFTERNOON

Closer to home Lipsky glances over at David at the wheel
who seems faraway and depressed

LIPSKY
What are you thinking

DAVID
Tour’s over

LIPSKY
Just hit you

DAVID
Yeah I’m gonna have to feel all this
now instead of just sleepwalk through
it

LIPSKY
What do you mean by “sleepwalk”

DAVID
I’ve kind of unplugged myself for the
last three weeks Meeting a whole lot
of new people having to do things
youre in a constant low-level state
of anxiety And sort of deep
existential you know fear that you
feel kind of all the way down to your
butthole

LIPSKY
What are you afraid of I mean
what’s the worst thing that could
possibly happen

DAVID
The worst That I’ll really get to
like it That’s the worst

LIPSKY
The attention

DAVID
Uh huh

LIPSKY

(nods then)
And what would be so wrong about that

DAVID

Become one of these hideous “Yet
another publication party and Hey
there’s Dave sticking his head in the
back of the photo” I’d rather be
dead

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
I don’t want to be seen that way
Why would you

LIPSKY
Well if you’re deriving your
satisfaction from talking about your
work as opposed to writing then
yeah I guess you’d get a lot less
done

DAVID
Exactly And there’s nothing more
grotesque than somebody who’s going
around “I’m a writer I’m a writer
I’m a writer”

Is that a dig at Lipsky Lipsky thinks so

DAVID
I don’t mind appearing in Rolling
Stone but I don’t want to appear in
Rolling Stone as somebody who wants to
be in Rolling Stone If you see me
like you know a guest on a game show
in a couple of years

Lipsky laughs Pause David is pensive again

DAVID
To have written a book about how
seductive image is and how many ways
there are to get seduced off any kind
of meaningful path because of the way
the culture is now What if I
become this parody of that very thing

Lipsky looks at David who stares straight ahead his eyes
maybe filling with tears

DAVID
Tomorrow you drive away get ona
plane this is over And I’m back to
knowing like twenty people Then I’m
going to have to like decompress from
getting all this attention Because
it’s like getting heroin injected into
your cortex

That registers with Lipsky

DAVID (CONTD)

And where I’m going to need real balls
is to be able to sit and go through
that And try to remind myself that
what the reality is that I’m thirty-
four years old and I’m alone ina
room with a piece of paper

They drive in silence
EXTINT DAVIDS HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT

The Grand Am pulls up its headlights the only artificial
light The Davids get out and remove their bags Inside
the dogs are barking in anticipation

David unlocks the door and the dogs greet him and Lipsky
exuberantly David kneels so that the dogs lick his face

DAVID
(in an Elvis voice)
I’m never leavin’ you again I swear

David looks around the carpet

DAVID
Shit Check
(discovers some)
Ah Look what you did

The dogs sheepishly watch David clean up their shit

DAVID
Happens to the best of us eh boy
Never fails Wait to do your thing
after the dog-sitter leaves
(to Lipsky)
Be sure your Rolling Stone readers
learn about that

David prepares to put on some music Tape recorder in hand
Lipsky approaches

LIPSKY
Uh Hey So I’m leaving tomorrow
and I’ve got to ask you about this
rumor

DAVID
Is this the heroin thing The heroin
thing again

LIPSKY
Yeah

DAVID
It isn’t true What is so hard for
you to believe

LIPSKY
The reason it is so hard to believe is
because there is so much about drugs
and addiction in the book

DAVID
That doesn’t mean it’s
autobiographical the drug stuff in
the book is basically a metaphor
Look at you You don’t fucking
believe a word I’m saying do you

LIPSKY
I didn’t say that

DAVID
I was not I never was a heroin
addict

LIPSKY

Okay The rumor I heard was that
in the late ‘80s when you were at
Harvard youd gotten involved with
drugs and had some kind of
breakdown

DAVID

I dont know if I had a breakdown I
got really really depressed I told
you that It had nothing to do with
drugs I mean Im somebody who spent
most of his life in libraries I never
lived that kind of dangerous life I
wouldnt even stick a needle into my
arm

LIPSKY
Okay so how do you think that rumor
got started

DAVID
I have no idea I have no idea

LIPSKY
Alright Calm down
DAVID
To tell you truly if you structured
this as some “and then he spiraled
into some terrible addiction thing”
it would be inaccurate It was more

like I got more and more unhappy The

more unhappy I would get the more I
would drink There was no joy in the
drinking I used it for anesthesia
Okay

LIPSKY
Okay What kind of drinker were you
Were you a falling-down drinker A
waking-up-in-the-curb drinker

DAVID
No I was not Okay Part of my
reticence about this whole thing is
that it wont make very good copy for
you Because no I was not like that
at all

LIPSKY
You did agree to this interview

DAVID
I know that I did

LIPSKY
Alright Im not gonna push much
further

DAVID

Im also aware that some addictions
are sexier than others My primary
addiction my entire life has been to
television I told you that Now
television addiction is of far less
interest to your readers than
something like heroin that confirms
the mythos of the writer -

LIPSKY
A myth I do not believe okay

DAVID
I know you dont believe that I’m
also aware that one of the things
swirling around here is you want the
best fucking article you can have

Why don’t you write whatever the fuck
you want but the fact of the matter
is it was not a Lost Weekend sort of
thing Nor was it some lurid romantic
writer-as-alcoholic-sort-of-thing
What it was was a 28-year-old person
who exhausted a couple other ways to
live really taken them to their
conclusion Which for me was a pink
room with a drain in the center of
the floor Which is where they put me
for an entire day when they thought I
was going to kill myself Where you
don’t have anything on and somebodys
observing you through a slot in the
wall And when that happens to you
you become tremendously
unprecedentedly willing to examine
some other alternatives for how to
live

David looks at him for a moment He walks out of the room
leaving Lipsky behind his head reeling Lipsky presses stop
on the tape recorder

INT DAVIDS HOUSEBATHROOM - 1996 - NIGHT 100

INT DAVIDS HOUSEGUEST ROOM - 1996 - NIGHT 101

Lipsky is in bed still awake in the moonlight The door
ajar David comes in He speaks softly in shadow He can’t
be seen and can’t see Lipsky very well it’s sort of like
confession

DAVID
You awake

LIPSKY
Yeah

DAVID

I was just thinking It wasnt a
chemical imbalance and it wasnt
drugs and alcohol It was much more
that I had lived an incredibly
American life That “If I could just
achieve X and Y and Z everything
would be OK”

(A beat)

Theres a thing in the book when
people jump out of a burning
skyscraper its not that theyre not
afraid of falling anymore its that
the alternative is so awful And then
youre invited to consider what could
be so awful that leaping to your
death seems like an escape from it I
dont know if youve had any
experience with this kind of thing
But its worse than any kind of
physical injury It may be what in
the old days was known as a spiritual
crisis Feeling as though every axiom
of your life turned out to be false
and there was actually nothing and
you were nothing and it was alla
delusion And that you were better
than everyone else because you saw
that it was a delusion and yet you
were worse because you cant fucking
function And it’s really horrible

(A beat)
I don’t think we ever change I’m
sure there are still those same parts
of me I’ve just got to find a way
not to let them drive Yknow

DAVID
Oh come on Now the whole world will
know what my mother’s known for years

He takes a bite
107 INT DAVIDS HOUSELIVING ROOM - 1996 - DAY

The dogs are in David and Lipsky’s faces while the men

eat

DAVID
Jeeves sit You see Jeeves gets
very obedient when food is around
You sit Drone It should be clear by
now that you’re not getting any of
this

Drone sits David feeds both dogs morsels of his food

DAVID
Good dog There you go thatta boy
(to Lipsky) Don’t leave food within
their reach - they will eat it

Lipsky takes a note

DAVID
You’re not gonna make me look like one
of those insane old women who talk to
their dogs are you

LIPSKY
Don’t worry

DAVID
I am worried my dogs’ll be offended

LIPSKY
Your dogs are not gonna read it

Drone playfully nudges Lipsky to the floor
DAVID
Wow - he’s never taken to a male like

LIPSKY

DAVID
Except for me of course

The phone rings David hands Lipsky his burger

DAVID

He turns away from Lipsky and lowers his voice but Lipsky can
still hear him

DAVID

Lipsky is stung After all the intimacy they shared Lipsky
is just “this guy”

DAVID

He hangs up Lipsky tries not to show his hurt

LIPSKY

cheesy 70s disco

LIPSKY
Really

DAVID

LIPSKY

DAVID’S VOICE

sculpture out of my car It’s like

David grabs his coat and gloves and goes outside Soon we
hear the sound of David scraping ice off his car which is
heard throughout the following

place softly describing what he sees into his recorder

INT DAVID’S HOUSEHALLWAYOFFICE - 1996 - DAY 112A

Lipsky sees the door to David’s office ajar for the first
time He pushes his way in and discovers a darkened room He
looks around quietly barely breathing sees the partially
illuminated keyboard and computer He goes to the closed
drapes pushes them aside and squints as he takes in the
brilliant snowy field

INT DAVIDS HOUSEGUEST ROOM - 1996 - DAY 112

The scraping is still heard Lipsky packs clothes a loafer
and stops when he sees his book The Art Fair He looks at
his author’s photo

EXT DAVIDS HOUSE - 1996 - DAY 113

His book in hand Lipsky trudges through the snow and finds
David systematically scraping away at his car

DAVID
Driving that rental of yours The
feeling of gliding This shit box
dudn’t even have shock absorbers

LIPSKY
What is it

DAVID
‘85 Nissan Sentra I know it doesn’t
look like much but man this thing
starts It’s actually a problem

LIPSKY
Why

DAVID
I gotta get a new one but I can’t junk
this

LIPSKY
Why not

DAVID
It’s my friend

LIPSKY
Ah

Pause
LIPSKY

Hey David I uh
Lipsky shyly presents David with a copy of his book

DAVID
Wow Just happened to have it on you

LIPSKY
I debated whether or not I should I do
this

DAVID
Why not

LIPSKY
I don’t know you don’t think this is
like some kid-brother sort of thing to
do

DAVID
No Thanks man I look forward to
reading it

LIPSKY
Youre welcome I wrote my address
and e-mail on the flyleaf

DAVID
I’1l read it soon as I’m done with the
Heinlein and I’1l send you a note

LIPSKY
Great Thanks

David flips through the book

DAVID
I’1l be curious to see what it’s like
being inside your head for a change
I like your cover

LIPSKY
Yeah me too I had them use the
cover art for the British edition

DAVID
Come on You got approval but I -
(stops himself)
It’s nice It’s very nice

Lipsky puts his bag in the Grand Am and slams the trunk

LIPSKY
Hey isn’t it reassuring that a lot of
people are reading you and saying
youre a really strong writer

DAVID
Itd be very interesting to talk to
you in a few years

LIPSKY
Why do you say that

DAVID

‘Cause my own experience is that
that’s not so The more people think
that you’re really good actually the
bigger the fear of being a fraud is
The worst thing about having a lot of
attention paid to you is that you’re
afraid of bad attention If bad
attention hurts you then the calibre

of the weapon that’s pointed at you

has gone way

up Like from a 22 toa

-45 But there’s a part of me that
wants a lot of attention And that
thinks I’m really good and wants

other people

to see it It’s one of

the ways I think we’re sort of alike

you know

LIPSKY

Uh huh

Lipsky smiles and nods

Pause

LIPSKY

(in farewell)

Well

Lipsky’s awkward attempt at a hug - unreciprocated by David -

turns into a clumsy han
David stands at his win

dshake Lipsky gets into the car
dow

DAVID
I’m not so sure you want to be me

LIPSKY

I don’t

DAVID

(A beat
Send my best

David shuts the door
while David returns to

looked back at his visi

MOMENTS LATER

Lipsky beholds a parcel The return address is “Dave
Wallace” What could it be He excitedly slices open the
box and peels away newspaper to reveal A SINGLE LOAFER And
a message written on a post-it “Yours I presume”
Accompanied by a smiley face Nothing on the reverse
Nothing else in the box That’s all Huh Lipsky smiles in
bemusement at the lone loafer

front seat of the car

INTERCUT
IE CAROUTSKIRTS - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY 119A

Flashes back to the car ride as described We see them
talking but cannot hear them all we hear is the sound of
tires on the road

LIPSKY (VO)
We are both so young He wants
something better than he has I want
precisely what he has already Neither
of us knows where our lives are going
to go It smells like chewing tobacco
soda and smoke And the conversation
is the best one I ever had

INT DANCE HALL - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - SUNSET 120

Lipsky imagines in slow-motion David dancing joyously

sweating like crazy with members of the church the night
Lipsky left the night that began the rest of his life

LIPSKY (VO) (CONTD)
David thought books existed to stop
you from feeling lonely If I could
Id say to David that living those
days with him reminded me of what life
is like -- instead of being a relief
from it and I’d tell him it made me
feel much less alone

The screen suddenly goes black
