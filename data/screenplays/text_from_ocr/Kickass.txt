EXT NEW YORK SKYLINE DAY 1

A wide shot in which you could be forgiven for failing to
spot a tiny brightly-clothed FIGURE on one of the rooftops

Over this we hear the voice of our hero DAVE LIZEWSKI

DAVE (VO)
I always wondered why nobody did it
before me I mean all those comic
books Movies TV shows You’d
think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume

We track in towards the figure a YOUNG MAN IN A SUPERHERO
COSTUME Perilously near the edge striking an iconic pose
With cool resolve he slips a pair of GOGGLES into position

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
Is everyday life really so
exciting are schools and offices
so thrilling that I’m the only one
who ever fantasized about this

He spreads his arms to reveal awesome MECHANICAL WINGS

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
C’mon Be honest with yourself

Calmly he dives off the roof
DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
At some point in our lives we all
wanted to be a superhero

A smile on his face A beautiful open vista of concrete and
glass windows reflecting the low sun He’s in flight

Oh wait No he’s not The smile fades This isn’t flying
Just good old-fashioned falling

YOUNG MAN
Fuuuuuck

Below pedestrians become aware of his impending approach
Pointing and screaming Camera phones Running to safety

He lands on a PARKED CAR It crumples like paper The CAR
ALARM strikes up over the crowd noise We needn’t look closer
to be sure that he’s dead But what the hell We track in

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
That’s not me by the way That’s
some Armenian guy with a history of
mental health problems On the
news his sister said he read about
me in the New York Post
EXT JERSEY CITY HIGH SCHOOL DAY 2

A huge antiquated building STUDENTS mill around outside A
CAR pulls up and out climbs highschool senior DAVID LIZEWSKI
Not quite Napoleon Dynamite but not quite Zac Efron either

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
That’s me Back before any of this
stuff happened Back when you’d
have to be a lot crazier than that
guy to try and be like me

He waves to his father MR LIZEWSKI who is driving

DAVE (CONTD)
Later Dad

And sets off towards the school entrance
DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Not saying there was anything wrong
with me Just that you’d have had a
hard time finding a hook
(a beat)
I mean I wasn’t into sport

HE strolls past a brace of SOCCER-TEAM GIRLS kicking a ball

INT HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 3

Dave joins the back of a line of kids all waiting to pass
one by one through a METAL DETECTOR ARCHWAY

DAVE (VO)
I wasn’t a mathlete

We move down the line to see three NICE KIDS ahead of him

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
or a hard-core gamer

Two BOYS Their t-shirts say “AFK” and “The cake is a lie”

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
I didn’t have a piercing or an
eating disorder or three thousand
friends on MySpace

Four skinny pierced EMOS stand at the front of the line

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
I wasn’t funny

A chubby white guy who we’ll come to know as MARTY dances
through the archway doing the “Soulja Boy” dance
INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM DAY 4
The bell RINGS Dave and the class scramble into their seats
DAVE (VO) (CONTD)

Like most people my age I just
existed

Dave’s teacher MRS ZANE 40 comes in A slightly chubby
borderline milf She takes off her jacket and hangs it up

INT DAVE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 5
Dave lies on his bed watching TV

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Kick in my bedroom door and youd
probably find me watching TV Or
talking to my friend Todd on Skype

Dave sits at his PC On the screen a You Tube page and ina
minimized window the face of Dave’s best friend TODD

TODD (ON THE SCREEN)
You watching Family Guy

DAVE
No

TODD (ON THE SCREEN)
Me neither

The sound dips and we return to Dave’s VO
DAVE (VO)

Or jerking off Mostly to my

biology teacher
INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM DAY 6
In a replay of what we just saw Mrs Zane takes off her
jacket Then she stares right at us and takes off her blouse
She reaches back to unhook her bra just as we cut to
INT DAVE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 7
From our vantage point under Dave’s desk we can see his

PANTS around his ankles A wad of SOILED TISSUES are dropped
into the WASTEPAPER BASKET by his feet

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Though to be honest it didn’t
take much to set me off

MASTURBATION MONTAGE 8

Dave’s COMPUTER SCREEN A homework document headed “The
Maasai tribe” and a shot of some bare-breasted tribeswomen

He types “traditional ceremonial bead-work” Then -
sentence abandoned - the cursor clicks to minimise the
document and bring the tribeswomen to the foreground

Another handful of tissues goes in the basket

Dave’s playing WORLD OF WARCRAFT His female NIGHT ELF is on
screen The cursor fliesto and fro removing all her clothes

Fingers moving urgently on the keyboard Dave types “dance”
The nearly-naked digital elf performs a sexy dance
Another tissue drops into the basket

A copy of TV GUIDE is tossed to the floor Followed by
another tissue

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
I tell you when my hormones
balance out shares in Kleenex are
gonna take a dive man

INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM DAY 9

Where we left off Mrs Zane takes her seat and leans forward
to put down her purse She catches Dave looking at her tits

MRS ZANE
Dave Lizewski You might want to be
looking at your textbook about now

DAVE
Yes Mrs Zane Sorry

She flashes a playful mock-stern frown then an amused smile
before looking away Truth is she’s flattered

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Sure a lot of what got me through
the average school day was making
deposits in the wack-off warehouse
for later But don’t get me wrong
I liked girls my own age too

INT HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR DAY 10

Dave walks the crowded corridor eyes fixed on a strikingly
cute girl who is fumbling in her locker KATIE DEAUXMA

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Especially Katie Deauxma

Katie looks up and breaks into a broad smile

KATIE
Hey gorgeous

DAVE
Hey

Katie claps her hand over her mouth and hearing a bark of
laughter from behind him Dave wheels round to see the person
Katie was actually addressing her best friend ERIKA CHO

KATIE
Oh my god

DAVE
No you meant - Erika I know I
knew that You were I was just

kidding I knew you didn’t

KATIE DAVE
Oh god »mean me
KATIE

DAVE
It’s cool Ok then See ya later

He hurries away Behind him Erika and Katie clutch each
other in helpless laughter as Katie dies of embarrassment

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
I was just a regular guy

INT DAVE’S KITCHEN DAY 11

Dave sits at the table with his DAD AND HIS MOM 42 She’s
eating cereal

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
No radioactive spiders No refugee
status from a doomed alien world

Dave morosely pours himself a bowl of CORN PUFFS
DAVE (CONTD)
Know what Todd said they do still
make Count Chocula They just don’t
sell it at the AandP any more

Suddenly Dave’s mom slumps forward onto the table

Her bowl of cereal crashes to the floor the spilled corn
puffs bouncing iconically towards us like the pearls from
Martha Wayne’s broken necklace

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
My mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen as opposed to a
gunman in an alley So if you were
hoping for any

Close on the cereal box as it morphs into

EXT GRAVE-YARD NIGHT 12

-A GRAVESTONE Behind it the New York skyline just visible
through a fierce storm Dave dripping wet fists aloft
raging at the heavens through the thunder and lightning

DAVE
I will avenge you mother

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
»-You’re outta luck

The tombstone morphs back into

INT DAVE’S KITCHEN DAY 13

-A box of COUNT CHOCULA cereal Just Dave and his dad at
the breakfast table now

DAVE (VO)
In fact in the eighteen months
since my mother died the only
epiphany I had was realizing that
like it or not life just goes on

Dave studies the cereal box

MR LIZEWSKI
They never had so many mallow
pieces when I was a kid

DAVE

INT COMIC BOOK STORE DAY 14

A fanboy’s dream Two storeys of comic books toys and
collectibles with a coffee-shop concession Dave is here
with Todd and Marty chatting and drinking frappucinos

DAVE
How come nobody’s ever tried to be
a superhero

MARTY
Gee I dunno Oh wait yeah I do
Cos it’s fucking impossible

DAVE
What putting on a mask and helping
people How is that impossible

TODD
That’s not a superhero though How

MARTY
It’s not even hero it’s fuckin’
psycho

DAVE

Hello What about Bruce Wayne He

in real life

DAVE
Yeah I guess I did mean that

MARTY
C’mon Anyone who did it for real
would just get their ass kicked
Theyd be dead in like a day

DAVE
I’m not saying they should do it I
just can’t figure out why no one
does Seriously out of all the
millions of people who love
superheroes you’d think at least
one would give it a try

(MORE)

DAVE (CONTD)
All those mid-life crisis guys in
the guitar store they’re never
gonna be rockstars but it doesn’t
stop ‘em buying guitars

MARTY TODD

DAVE (CONTD)
Jesus doesn’t it bug you Why do
thousands of people wanna be Paris
Hilton and nobody wants to be
Spiderman

MARTY

like no tits None at all

TODD
Maybe it’s the porn tape He
doesn’t have a porn tape

MARTY
You never saw One Night in
Spiderman

They all crack up But suddenly Todd is distracted

TODD
Holy shit check out the wheels

He nods over to the storefront window A huge black stretch
S-class MERCEDES has pulled up outside

DAVE
Looks like Mr D’Amico traded in
the hummer

TODD
Nah He probably kept it And has
like both

A teenage boy climbs out - CHRIS D’AMICO 17 and self-
conscious He shuffles in followed by a large BODY GUARD

Chris begins to browse a rack of comics sneaking a look over
at Dave and his friends before looking hurriedly away

DAVE
Is it just me or do you feel kinda
sorry for Chris D’Amico

MARTY
Yeah Woah Must suck to have a
rich dad and everything you want
(MORE )

MARTY (CONTD)
In fact I wish you hadn’t brought
it up I think I’m gonna cry

DAVE
Yeh but he’s always on his own

TODD
We should like talk to him See
if he wants to hang with us

DAVE
I wasn’t saying we should talk to
him just like -

TODD
Itd be awesome Think about it if
he was our friend no one would
ever fuck with us again

Dave and Marty consider this Marty nods over towards Chris

MARTY
Go on then Todd

TODD
Nuh-uh Dave should go

DAVE
Why I just said I felt sorry - Aw
shit ok fine
Dave makes his way over to the register where Chris is now
in line Nearby the Bodyguard pretends to read a comic
Chris sees Dave approaching and smiles Dave smiles back with
an awkward wave The bodyguard glances up from the comic

BODY GUARD
Fuck off

This guy is massive Dave does not need to be asked twice

From Chris’ pov we watch Dave return to his friends and re-
enact the encounter All three burst into laughter

EXT DODGY STREET DAY 15
Dave and Todd walk home carrying their BAGS of new comics

Then from nowhere TWO GANG KIDS block their path The
bigger kid holds out his hand matter-of-factly

slices the back of her hand She stops and studies the cut

EXT DODGY STREET DAY 40
At a junction Dave wheels his bike beside Todd and Marty
all carrying BAGS from the comic store This is where they
part company Dave mounts up waves goodbye and rides off

He rides on down the same shitty street we saw earlier

Nearby two boys skulk by a car The guys who mugged Dave and

Todd One has a SCREWDRIVER He looks up stares at Dave

DAVE (VO)
Like every serial killer already
knew eventually fantasizing just
doesn’t do it for you anymore It
was time to engage

gradually slows until at the next alleyway he stops dead

Dave chains his bike to a fire-escape He tears open his
shirt revealing his costume underneath This is it

EXT DODGY STREET DAY 42

The first gang kid has his screwdriver wedged under the
window rubber and is prying it off His friend loiters
nearby smoking a JOINT and keeping lookout

They pause utterly bewildered at the sight of Dave
Walking towards them in his full costumed splendor

SECOND GANG KID
What the fuck

FIRST GANG KID
The fuck are you looking at

Dave hesitates They start to walk towards him

FIRST GANG KID (CONTD)

a car that somebody probably worked
their ass off to pay for

DAVE
I’m not high I just think it sucks
that you figure you can do whatever
you want Walk away from the car
and we can just forget about it

Without warning the first kid steps up and punches Dave
Dave reels But now we see that behind his back he has a
piece of LEAD PIPE He cracks it over the kid’s head The kid
goes down the screwdriver flying from his hand

A beat Then the second kid sets on Dave The pipe gives Dave
an initial advantage But now the first guy is up again

FIRST GANG KID
Fuck this shit You crazy man

He pulls A KNIFE and before Dave even realizes it he’s been
stabbed in the gut He looks down in disbelief Then drops

The gang kids run Dave gets up and staggers to the road

EXT ROAD CONTINUOUS 43

Dave stumbles into the road as A CAR approaches He tries to
flag it but the ALARMED FEMALE DRIVER accelerates past him

Dave turns in disbelief to watch the car disappear into the
distance failing to see A SECOND CAR speed towards him It
ploughs into him sending him flying like a rag-doll

The car slows and a terrified BUSINESSMAN stares out to see

Dave is out cold his legs and pelvis grotesquely twisted
his costume covered in blood The driver is in serious shit

He looks around No witnesses Panicking he speeds away

INT AMBULANCE DAY 44

We fade up to Dave’s POV A SIREN is wailing A MEDIC is
cutting off his costume The medic shouts up to the driver

We fade up to Dave’s POV a blur of bright lights and
concerned faces as the hospital gurney speeds him along

DAVE (VO)
I don’t remember a whole lot from
the first days at the hospital
Just that the pain was a thousand
times worse than anything I’d ever
experienced

A nurse leans down with a needle

DAVE (CONTD)
And the morphine was a thousand
times better

Dave lies in a hospital bed bandaged and wired up asleep
Beside him sits his drained father staring into space

INT WAREHOUSE NIGHT 46

A rather battered Russian DANIL 30 sits on a chair hands
tied behind his back Nearby Big Joe talks on his cell

BIG JOE

more No They only treat the
lumber here now Yeah but the
thing they use for that is even
better Exactly Okay cool
(MORE )

BIG JOE (CONTD)
(to Huge Goon)
Go ahead

The Huge Goon pulls Danil up and followed by Joe begins to
walk him across the warehouse past piles of WOOD

DANIL
Look the guy tells me he is Tre
Fernandez what do I know Now you
say Fernandez is dead so okay
this guy he lie about who he is

They arrive at a large INDUSTRIAL MICROWAVE OVEN its door
open The Huge goon punches Danil in the face and pushes him
inside He bolts the door and studies the OPERATION PANEL

HUGE GOON
Does it have settings Like ona
regular microwave

BIG JOE
The fuck do I know We’re not
making a fucking Hungry Man dinner

Exasperated Joe leans past the goon and hits the LARGEST
BUTTON A very loud WHIRR starts up

BIG JOE (CONTD)
(shouting to Danil)
Who did you buy our coke from And
this time don’t tell us somebody
who’s dead

Danil peers out desperate his hand cupped to his ear
HUGE GOON
Can he hear you I don’t think he
can hear you
BIG JOE

I SAID WHO REALLY SOLD YOU OUR
COKE

Now Danil is in pain We can faintly hear him shrieking

Big Joe begins to mime his question one word at a time an
open handed shrug a “handing over” gesture a point

BIG JOE (CONTD)
WHO SOLD YOU

But before he can finish there’s a popping sound and -
SPLAT - the viewing window is decorated with Danil’s insides

BIG JOE (CONTD)
Shit

INT HOSPITAL DAY 47

Dave lies in bed awakening slowly from his sleep In the
chair where we last saw Dave’s father is his mother

DAVE
Mom What are you doing here

MOTHER
David honey you need to get better

you You really can’t go dying

Dave squeezes his eyes shut

DAVE
This isn’t real

Nah I don’t believe in ghosts

He opens his eyes She’s gone and in her place is a CHINESE
FAMILY in traditional rural dress - a MAN a PREGNANT WOMAN
and FIVE SMALL CHILDREN The woman turns to her husband and
whispers in Mandarin subtitled

CHINESE WOMAN
He believes in reincarnation

CHINESE MAN
(to Dave subtitled)
You do know that statistically
there’s a one in three chance of
coming back as a Chinese peasant

The woman rubs her belly and smiles ominously at Dave

DAVE
(in Mandarin subtitled)
Is that even true If you’re just
going on numbers aren’t I more
likely to come back as an insect or
something

The Chinese family have gone In their place a GIANT SPIDER
now sits in the chair

GIANT SPIDER
You have a point there

DAVE
Shit I really don’t wanna come
back as a spider

GIANT SPIDER
Why not

DAVE
I don’t know It’s just not really
how I saw things going Eating
flies fucking other spiders

The spider climbs onto the bed and straddles him

GIANT SPIDER
Hey don’t knock it ‘til you’ve
tried it baby

A doctor hurries into the room with Dave’s father They rush
over to the bed apparently unaware of the spider’s presence

MR LIZEWSKI
(to the doctor)
See I think he’s

DAVE

I’1l come back and break your
fucking legs

Dave turns to leave but Leroy steps into his path

Rasul grabs Dave’s shoulder but before he can do anything
else Dave has pulled his TASER He tasers Rasul who shrieks
and falls twitching to the ground

Dave tries to make a break for it but Leroy tackles him to
the ground Dave struggles to load his spare cartridge into
the now empty taser but Leroy is too strong

The other thug helps Rasul up and Rasul pulls a knife

RASUL
You are so fucking dead man I’m -

He stops in mid sentence and his eyes bug out as he looks
down in surprise at a LONG BLADE bursting from his stomach

He keels over forwards to reveal a huge knife through his
back and standing behind him the tiny costumed figure who
put it there Her mask conceals her face but when she pulls
a pair of butterfly knives from her little utility belt and
begins to flip them we know for sure that it’s Mindy

MINDY
Who’s next

Leroy and the thug look at one another in disbelief and Dave
stands frozen in shock as Mindy launches herself at them

It’s an extraordinary sight as this tiny lethal figure flies
between the two knives flashing deflecting every blow as
she slices and dices these two guys three times her size

When they lie bleeding she pulls the knife from Rasul’s back
and stares at Dave Terrified he aims his taser at her

MINDY (CONTD)
Dude that is one fuckin’ gay-
lookin’ taser
(a beat)
Chill We’re on the same team

Dave lowers it dumbstruck and watches as she turns the
apartment upside down Soon she finds a holdall and pulls
out several BAGS OF COCAINE She crams them back in the
holdall grabs it and heads for an OPEN WINDOW - the way she
came in we presume She climbs out onto the fire escape

Dave watches her still glued to the spot Mindy pokes her
head back into the room

MINDY (CONTD)
C’mon dipshit Can’t use the front
door now

EXT FIRE ESCAPE NIGHT 83

Too scared to protest Dave follows her up the fire escape

EXT HOUSING PROJECT ROOF NIGHT 84
Dave stops out of breath Reluctantly Mindy pauses too

DAVE
Wait wait Who are you

She holds out her little gloved hand It’s covered in other
people’s blood Reluctantly Dave shakes it

MINDY
I’m Hitgirl And that’s Big Daddy

She points to the next building where we can see Damon also
in superhero costume Dave gives him a small awkward wave

Damon salutes puts his fingers to his lips - shhh - then
draws his finger across his throat

MINDY (CONT’D)
Come on

She breaks into a run towards the edge of the roof

Dave runs too but as the gap between the buildings yawns
wide before him slams on the brakes in terror at the last
moment Mindy keeps going leaping fearlessly into the void
and landing on the roof opposite

She looks back shrugs takes Damon’s hand and waves goodbye
to Dave before the two turn and run towards the next rooftop
And they’re gone

EXT FIRE ESCAPE NIGHT 85
Dave climbs shakily down the fire escape to the street

DAVE (VO)

Hitgirl and Big Daddy they were
the real deal Me I was just a
stupid dick in a wetsuit

INT DAVE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 86
Dave sneaks into his room and sits down heavily on the bed

DAVE (VO)
A stupid dick with a real problem

The superhero duvet-cover toys and other detritus of Dave’s
childhood around the room remind us that he’s just a kid He
pulls off his blood-spattered mask curls up into a ball and
starts to cry

INT D’AMICO’S PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN DAY 87
A grim-faced Big Joe sits with Frank the huge goon nearby

FRANK

FRANK

He holds his hand out and the goon passes him a blood-stained
cellphone He wipes it with his sleeve and gives it to Frank

BIG JOE (CONT’D)
Sal’s phone It was in his hand

ON THE PHONE’S SCREEN A blurred image of a large costumed
figure - who we might recognise as Big Daddy - vaulting out
of an open window

BIG JOE (CONTD)

INT DAVE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 88

Dave lies in bed asleep and gradually we realize that is
this is a POV shot somebody is creeping closer as he dozes

Dave’s eyes snap open and he leaps out of bed cowering It’s
Mindy and Damon in full Hit Girl and Big Daddy costume

DAVE
I didn’t say anything to anyone I
swear

DAMON

Good move Let’s keep it that way

Dave nods like crazy Petrified Mindy holds out a handful of
unfamiliar-looking SMALL PLASTIC BITS Dave peers at them

MINDY
Know what this is All the
cartridge shit that comes outta
your gay taser when you fire it
You do know the police could’a
traced it right back to you if
they’d found it Lucky for you I
picked it up

DAVE
I I Thanks

Dave reaches out to take the pieces from her Damon’s hand
shoots out and grabs Dave’s wrist before it gets anywhere
near With his other hand he takes the pieces himself

DAMON
Let’s call it insurance Makes it
easier for me to take your word
See we like you But we don’t
trust you

MINDY
Don’t take it personal though We
don’t trust anybody

DAMON
I recommend it
(a beat)
Listen I re-routed your IP address
for you Finding you was way too
easy

DAVE
Shit I hadn’t - God I owe you
But you know I’m thinking of
shutting my site down anyway
quitting This is insane I’m in
way over my head

MINDY
Shame You have potential

DAMON
Your call But y’know we’re
around if you need us

DAVE
(humouring him)
Thanks That’s really nice of you

DAMON
We don’t do nice But put it this
way there’s a whole lot of people
in this town we’d rather see
accessorizing with a toe tag

DAVE
How do I get hold of you

MINDY
(deadpan)
Oh just contact the mayor’s office
He has this special signal he
shines into the sky It’s in the
shape of a dick and balls

DAMON
You need us put on your site that
youre on vacation Well find you

Dave nods confused Damon salutes takes Mindy by the hand
and climbs out of the window Mindy follows blowing a kiss

MINDY
Sweet dreams

So I didn’t get a mail back from

She emerges from behind the curtain in an absurdly sexy
dress She does a little twirl in front of the mirror

KATIE (CONTD)
What do you think

DAVE
-Awesome Just Wow
KATIE
Shit can you totally see my
nipples
DAVE

Uh No A bit Is that bad
She throws a few poses in the mirror frowning

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Being Katie’s gay best friend

get a boner

Katie sticks her hand into her top assessing the
transparency of the fabric

KATIE

Oh hey I read those old Ditko

actually pretty good

DAMON
Thank you Dimitri We appreciate
your cooperation

DIMITRI

smiles and hits a BUTTON The crusher grinds into action
Momentarily a small metal CUBE lands at her feet

MINDY

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT DAY 93

Gigante has called a group of COPS into his office All sit
around staring into space largely disinterested except
Detective Marcus Williams The cop we saw tailing Mindy

GIGANTE
Look I get that you all like him
I’m just saying we give hima
friendly reminder that we don’t
encourage the public to take the
law into their own hands

MARCUS
This is not about us liking him
Gigante It’s about having better
things to do than hunt down some
guy who roughed up a few gang-
bangers

GIGANTE
Ah Detective Williams Why am I
not surprised by your lack of co-
operation

MARCUS
Ill keep an eye out But trust me
we have bigger burgers to barbecue

GIGANTE
Then you better get your damn apron
on Marcus Dismissed All of you

INT DAMON AND MINDY’S PLACE DAY 94

There’s nobody here Suddenly the LOCK on the door flies out
and onto the floor Detective Marcus walks in

He inspects the apartment stopping at the wall Where before
we saw the row of comic-book style portraits is now a huge
pyramid arrangement of pictures The lower ones - all the
gangsters Damon and Mindy have killed including Rasul - have
red crosses through them The higher ones are as-yet
unmarked At the very top is Frank

Marcus keeps walking notes the huge stash of weapons He
opens drawers and rifles through their contents He picks up
what appears to be a home-made COMIC and begins to read

ANIMATED COMIC BOOK SEQUENCE 95

- We linger on the first panel static Two cops - a black
guy and a white guy bearing more than a passing resemblance
to Damon and Marcus himself - stand side-by-side beaming
proudly In front of them a photographer snaps a shot

- In the next panel also static we see the shot captured
in black and white on the cover of a newspaper The headline
above it reads LOCAL SUPER-COP TEAM LEAD THE WAR ON DRUGS

- We whip to the third panel still static to see the white
cop - definitely Damon - about to get into his cop car when a
hand taps him on the shoulder

- Now the artwork comes to life in animation as we see Damon
turn around to see a man who is unmistakably Frank He has an
oleaginous smile and a huge fistful of money

- A thought-bubble springs from Damon’s head containing an
image of himself and a pretty heavily-pregnant woman
standing together in front of a dingy apartment block The
image magically changes to show the two wearing new upscale
clothes standing outside a beautiful mansion

- The thought bubble bursts and we pan back down to Damon
shaking his head and holding up his hand to refuse the money

- Frank red-faced hands in angry fists smoke coming from
his head Suddenly a light-bulb appears overhead He grins

- Damon and his pregnant wife watch TV Suddenly a huge team
of cops burst in The cops tear through the apartment until
one - whom we recognise as Gigante - produces two huge bags
of white powder Damon and his wife react in shock

- An establishing image of jail house gates
- In a prison cell Damon sits his head in his hands

- Outside the jail a sad Marcus puts a comforting arm around
Damon’s now-even-more-heavily-pregnant wife who is crying

- In his penthouse Frank laughs maniacally

- In a female hand we see an envelope marked “bill” It is
tossed into the air and we follow it as it lands atop a
colossal tower of other bills We pan down to find Damon’s
pregnant wife sitting in its shadow weeping

- Marcus enters Damon’s place looking concerned His look
turns to horror as he sees Damon’s wife lying on the ground
a bottle of pills in her hand pills scattered about

- An ambulance streaks across the frame siren blaring

- A doctor lifts a newborn baby into view But we pan down
to see another doctor mournfully drawing a sheet over the
peaceful face of Damon’s wife She’s dead

- The first doctor hands the smiling baby to Marcus

- Marcus and the baby - now in a little pink dress a bow in
her hair - sit in a prison visiting room the baby waving to
a sad-faced Damon

- In a sunny playground Marcus plays happily with the baby
now a pretty little toddler becoming recognizably Mindy

- In the jail Damon works out aggressively transforming
from a regular guy into the Big Daddy we now know acquiring
a moustache and a psychotic look in his eye along the way

- A comic book caption says FOUR YEARS LATER Outside the
jail-house gates Marcus hands Mindy - now looking about four
years old - over to Damon and she waves goodbye to Marcus

- The sky darkens All around them we see the squalor of a
run-down crime-ridden neighbourhood And looming over them
filling the horizon is the giant demonic face of Frank

- Close on Damon’s big hand Mindy puts her little hand in
his Pull back to see they are now in costume Hit Girl and
Big Daddy Ready to fight back The image freezes and we pull
back again to see

Holy shit Stop

The driver complies and now we see what Frank has Kickass
Just walking The goon pulls his gun Frank stays his hand

FRANK (CONTD)

Follow that superhero
(to the heavens)
Thank you

The limo crawls along a discreet distance behind Kickass as
he continues on his way oblivious pausing only for the
occasional high-five from passers by He takes a left down a
quiet side-street

FRANK (CONTD)
Oh you are mine

As the limo corners Frank leaps out and runs at Kickass

FRANK (CONTD)
Hey Kickass

Kickass spins round to be met with a perfect round-house kick
from Frank He goes down instantly Frank utterly out of
control kicks him furiously as he lies there motionless

FRANK (CONTD)
Kill my men huh Take my fucking
coke

A lone ONLOOKER stops and stares in horror at the bizarre
sight of a well-dressed man laying into a superhero

FRANK (CONTD)
(to onlooker )
You want some
The onlooker runs away as the goon runs over gun in hand

HUGE GOON
Boss what the fuck

Frank snatches it and shoots the fleeing onlooker before
holding the gun to Kickass’s head and pulling the trigger

his thrill at finally being accepted into his dad’s world

EXT WAREHOUSE ROOF NIGHT 160
Close on THREE BULLET HOLES A little finger pokes them We
pull back to find Mindy The top of her costume hiked up so
she can examine her kevlar vest

She shrugs pulls her costume back down and reaches round to
the back of her utility belt She produces a small package
On it is written FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY

She tears it open She pulls out a piece of PAPER that reads
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME CALL MARCUS 212 555 7407

Then she pulls out a syringe She plunges it into her arm
Close on Mindy’s eye Her pupil dilates a black vortex

She puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION GOGGLES and - like a small
colorful deadly tornado - she leaps down from the roof

INT WAREHOUSE CONTINUOUS 161
The zippo lighter touches Damon At once he’s in flames

A small hand hits a light switch And everything goes black

Dimly lit by the screaming Damon alight we can see the
goons look to one another in puzzlement

Seconds later Hit Girl is all over them We cut between her
night-vision POV and the eerily beautiful darkness

illuminated by her burning father as one by one she slices
and dices the hoods into submission She’s taking a few hits
sure but she appears to be utterly oblivious to them

Last man down Mindy runs to Damon and beats out the flames
All is black now We hear footsteps as she runs to the light

ON A COMPUTER SCREEN The dark image of the room lights up
The tripod must have been knocked during the fight so what
we see now is several dead goons and in the corner of the

frame a shocked - but very alive - Kickass

INT WAREHOUSE CONTINUOUS 162
Mindy pulls a gun from her belt and levels it at the camera

Katie reacts with near-hysterical relief In sharp contrast
to the junkies who continue to stare impassively

INT WAREHOUSE NIGHT 167
Blinking in the light Mindy runs to Damon But as her steps
slow and her face falls we surmise that the sight greeting
her isn’t good And we’re right we need no medical degree to
make a grim prognosis for the thoroughly fried Damon

DAMON
So proud of you baby I love you

He closes his eyes His eyelids are the only things that
aren’t burned Mindy plants a gentle kiss on one of them

MINDY
I love you too Daddy Sleep tight

And he’s gone Her face set in a brave show of stoicism
Mindy moves briskly to the traumatised Dave and unties him

MINDY (CONTD)
Let’s get the hell outta here
EXT DAMON’S CAR NIGHT 168
Mindy and Dave arrive at the car Dave has removed his mask

DAVE

169 INT DAMON’S CAR NIGHT 169

The two drive through Manhattan battered and shell-shocked
Mindy can barely see over the wheel

DAVE
What’s your name I mean your real
name

MINDY
A superhero never reveals his true
identity

DAVE
Look you can’t However you

lived before It’s over Is there
anybody else Any other family or

MINDY
Fuck you I can take care of
myself I saved your sorry ass

DAVE
But I mean what about money
You’ve got to think long-term -

MINDY
I’ve got three million dollars in a
fucking suitcase That long-term
enough for ya Just leave me alone

DAVE
I’m not going anywhere ‘til i know
you’re okay I owe you If it
wasn’t for you I’d be dead

MINDY
And if it wasn’t for you my dad
wouldn’t be

DAVE
(a painful beat)
And I owe it to him to look
after you He wouldn’t have wanted
you to be on your own

170 INT DAMON AND MINDY’S PLACE NIGHT 170

The door opens into the dark Mindy hits the light

The first thing they see pinned to the wall is the Hit Girl
and Big Daddy picture that Damon did for Mindy’s birthday
They both stare at it A sad awkward moment

Dave holding MARCUS’S NUMBER breaks the silence

DAVE
We should call this number your dad
gave you
MINDY
Not now I’ll do it later okay
DAVE
Ok Look pack up whatever you

need And we’ll go to my place
I’1l figure out something to tell
my dad when he gets back from his
night shift I need to clean up

INT DAMON AND MINDY’S PLACE - BATHROOM NIGHT 171

It’s grimy Dave rinses the blood from his face and hair

INT DAMON AND MINDY’S PLACE NIGHT 172

Like a tiny Rambo Mindy begins to tool up weighing up
RIFLES and HANDGUNS sharpening KNIVES with a WATER STONE

We intercut between her and Dave’s clean up until finally
Dave walks out of the bathroom to find Mindy fully tooled up
and shoving additional WEAPONS into an OVERNIGHT BAG

DAVE
Woah I meant like pyjamas and
stuff And clothes You can’t

MINDY
You know what my dad would have
wanted He would have wanted me to
finish what we started And that’s
what I’m gonna do You can try and
stop me Or live Your choice

Dave looks around Blueprints and plans CCTV feeds on the
laptop Picture of Frank pinned to the wall by a shuriken

DAVE
Frank D’Amico

MINDY
You know him

DAVE
I know who he is

MINDY
My dad said Jersey City used to be
a real nice safe place to raise a
family Then D’Amico started up his
little business enterprise Flooded
the street with cheap drugs Armed
the gangs Bought-off the cops

Dave squints at the CCTV footage on the laptop then looks
over at the plans again Mindy continues to assemble a gun

DAVE
This is his place All this
security I don’t even see -

MINDY
Let him go the whole thing starts
up again New guys New supplies
All our hard work wasted

DAVE
I know but this plan of yours
Even if there were ten of you -

MINDY
My mom already died for nothing
I’m not gonna let my dad die for
nothing too

DAVE
You can’t do this on your own It’s
suicide

MINDY

Exactly You wanna deal with owing
my dad Then shut the fuck up and
pick your weapon

Mindy opens the big crate Dave gapes at its contents

DAVE
That what I think it is

MINDY
Damn straight Better start reading
the instructions cos you’re gonna
be using it in about five minutes

Dave picks up his duffle coat and his mask He looks at both
Then he puts on his coat and shoves the mask in the pocket
He shakes his head at her sadly

DAVE
Id do anything to bring your dad
back if I could Anything But
nothing will And if I

pull out again and find

The bodyguard - the one we first saw with Chris at the
comic store - watching the same images on D’Amico’s monitors

Suddenly the screens go DEAD He reacts What the fuck

INT D’AMICO’S APARTMENT BLOCK -LOBBY NIGHT 174

Posh Goon and ANOTHER GOON on guard look confused as Mindy -
innocent in her street clothes - stumbles in crying

POSH GOON
Hey What’s the matter

MINDY
I lost my mommy and daddy

Another hood steps forward and offers his cell

ANOTHER GOON
You wanna use the phone You know
your phone number

EXT ROOF TOP NIGHT 175

Dave stands on a rooftop gazing out towards the Manhattan
skyline No mask But no duffle-coat either

DAVE (VO)
Had I ever been a real superhero
The most I’d ever had to offer the
world was good intentions and a
slightly elevated capacity to take
a kicking

With no power comes no
responsibility

Except that wasn’t true

Dave pulls on his mask And he starts to run

INT D’AMICO’S PENTHOUSE CONTINUOUS 181

Mindy’s inside the apartment now and YET MORE GOONS are
down but two remain - Scary Goon and the Bodyguard also
armed They open fire She’s leaping around absorbing the
hits in her bulletproof vest until she trips and falls
Scary Goon aims at her head but he’s out of ammo

SCARY GOON
In the head She’s wearing a
fucking vest

The bodyguard raises his gun but before he can shoot
there’s an almighty smash from behind them as the GLASS
CONSERVATORY leading to the roof terrace explodes in a shower
of glass to reveal Dave coming in to land opening fire with
a machine gun in each hand The recoil sends him tumbling
onto his back on the terrace But he keeps shooting

The bodyguard and Scary have barely had a chance to turn and
register before they get it in the back and go down cold

Mindy’s smile lights up Dave smiles back Mindy limps over

MINDY
Gimme the guns

DAVE
We’re out of bullets

MINDY
(sniggering)
Rounds Ok Only one to go anyway

She runs towards the corridor Dave throws down the now-
useless guns and follows her

Mindy reaches the first door kicks it in It’s a bedroom We
see Angie cowering in a corner Mindy takes a step in when
outside we hear SIRENS Her face falls

MINDY (CONT’D)
You called the cops

DAVE
I called the number Your dad’s
friend Told him to meet us He -

MINDY
He is the fucking cops

In a hurry now Mindy turns her back on Angie and runs on to
the next door Dave racing to catch up She kicks it open
It’s Frank’s study The motherlode
INT D’AMICO’S PENTHOUSE - STUDY CONTINUOUS

A beat as Frank stands in the middle of the trashed
and stares at Mindy Dave catches up just in time to
Mindy fly at him

Now we have two fights going on - Mindy vs Frank and Dave
vs Chris The former a spectacular display of fighting
prowess the second essentially a messy scrap between two

frightened kids in superhero costumes

Just as it looks like Mindy is a goner she regains the upper-
hand with breath-taking aplomb and sends Frank crashing

through the window down 70 storeys to his death
Chris stops fighting and howls in horror

MINDY (CONT’D)
(to Chris)
Your turn

CHRIS
No wait please I never Please
don’t hurt me I’m just a kid

MINDY
So am I and you fucking shot me

throat

It’s not this that stops her however but THE COPS A
sizeable team of them crashing in towards them armed
FIRST COP
Freeze Police

Chris and Dave put their hands up immediately Mindy
however goes for a STUN GRENADE in her belt Before anyone
has a second to react it’s landed by the cops and gone off

In the fog and confusion Mindy grabs Dave’s hand They run

EXT D’AMICO’S ROOF TERRACE NIGHT

Mindy helps Dave into the jet pack and puts her arms round
him Just as the cops get to the terrace the two take off

One cop takes aim at them Suddenly a shout from behind him

MARCUS (0S)
Hold your fire

It’s Marcus He smiles as he watches them disappear over the

horizon like Superman and a very tiny Lois Lane

Finally he turns to go inside the smile still on
to find Gigante incandescent with anger

GIGANTE
You’1l go down for that Williams
Your ass is going straight to
tribunal I’1l see to it myself

Marcus grins and produces a framed photograph He

MARCUS

Oh this is nice You look awesome
GIGANTE

What
MARCUS

Just found this on D’Amico’s desk
Isn’t this a great shot guys

his face

admires it

Marcus shows the picture around to the assembled cops who

react in delighted shock Gigante reels He knows

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Hope Frank D’Amico paid you well
Gigante You’re gonna be needing
one fine-ass lawyer

EXT ROOFTOP DAWN

it’s over

Dave and Mindy land on the roof of Mindy’s building

MINDY
Thanks Kickass My dad would have
been proud of both of us

Dave pulls his mask off meaningfully

DAVE
Dave My name is Dave Lizewski

MINDY
I know that dumbass

A long pause Then Mindy pulls off her mask too

MINDY (CONTD)
Mindy Macready

She holds out her hand and they shake hands It’s over

EXT HIGH SCHOOL DAY 185

Mr Lizewski’s car pulls up outside the school Dave climbs
out and waves goodbye to him

As Dave begins to walk he turns around to see ANOTHER CAR
pull up Driven by Marcus In the passenger seat Mindy
Marcus hugs her and she hops out and runs over to Dave

DAVE (VO)
Mindy moved in with Marcus and he
enrolled her at my school - first
school she’d ever been to - on the
promise that I’d look out for her

Before she reaches him however a BIG MEAN BOY and his THREE
CRONIES block Mindy’s path He holds out his hand

BIG MEAN BOY
Hey New kid Lunch money Now

We cut to Dave’s concerned face OS there’s a scream

When we cut back to Mindy she’s once more trotting happily
towards Dave waving as if nothing has happened In the
background a CONCERNED CROWD has formed a circle around
whatever carnage Mindy left

DAVE (VO)
Not that she needed me to

Marty and Todd are sitting in the sunshine reading comics
Dave and Mindy join them Mindy checking out the comics

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
The guys never knew about what
happened And Katie

(MORE)

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
Well besides being deeply relieved
that my superhero days were over
Katie was the same as ever

From the other direction we see Katie walking over with
Erika and a slightly chubby FLAMBOYANTLY-DRESSED GUY

KATIE
Hey everybody this is Phil He’s
new Phil this is everybody

Marty Todd Dave and Mindy all wave their greetings

DAVE (VO)
And I loved her for it

Katie and the boy sit down with the group Dave rests his
head on Katie’s shoulder We’ve never seen him so contented

In the foreground TWO LABORERS walk past carrying the metal
detector archway away from the school

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
But the world around us was
changing

We pull back a little to see the two gang kids from earlier
peering into a parked car at the entrance to the school A
FOXY WOMAN IN A SUPERHERO COSTUME walks towards them They
nod at her shiftily and amble away

We pull back further and see the streets around the school
are patrolled by various other SUPERHEROES

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
People said I’d been the
inspiration for the others But I
saw it differently

We pull back further still across the water to Manhattan
Here’s the Armenian Guy from the beginning in his winged
suit climbing up the fire escape of a building There are
SUPERHEROES everywhere Walking the streets Running across
the cars in a traffic jam Leaping across the rooftops

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
All I did was make a door into a

world I’d dreamed about since I was
a little kid Now it was open And

the world was coming out

We pull upwards now further and further back ‘til the
superheroes are just brightly colored dots on the streets

DAVE (VO) (CONT’D)
That’s how it looked to me And I
liked what I saw

Just as we think it’s all over the camera pushes through a
window into

INT D’AMICO’S PENTHOUSE - STUDY DAY 186

The study has been restored and redecorated and there’s
someone sitting here with his back to us admiring his
reflection in the glass-topped table

The camera tracks round and we see Chris A crazy look in
his eyes wearing a new more menacing costume He slips on
an evil-looking mask Clearly a super-hero no more now a
super-villain He turns to stare down onto the street

CHRIS
A world full of superheroes huh
As a great man once said “wait
‘til they get a load of me”

FADE TO WHITE
