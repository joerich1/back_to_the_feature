scrapes at the ground revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING

made of WOODEN PLANKS He wedges a fallen branch under
one side and using a rock for the fulcrum pries up the
covering

WYBIE (CONTD)
See Supposed to be so deep if you fell
to the bottom and looked up youd see a
sky full of stars in the middle of the
day

CORALINE
(SOFTENS)

Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head
noticing her change in tone He steps off the branch and
the well cover thumps in place

her pad She sets the doll on a low table beside an open
moving box and smiles
The box is filled with her moms collection of
SNOWGLOBES She takes out her favorite - the BEAR
FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT Z00 - and shakes it She studies
the globe and sighs with homesickness She sets it
carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL then unwraps the rest
of the snowglobes and places them beside it

Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE
a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt his hand
holding an EMPTY CONE Coraline takes up pad and pen and
adds to her list muttering aloud

CORALINE
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
painting four incredibly boring
windows and no more doors

She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow
globe box Its gone

CORALINE (CONTD)
All right little me where are you
hiding

Scanning the room she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM
BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall

doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the

ANGLE ON CORALINE A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair She
knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE

CORALINE

(TRIUMPHANT)
I knew it was real

She opens her eyes smiles and CRAWLS FORWARD

ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW CAMERA PULLS BACK and
we FIND the BLACK CAT perched on the wet window sill
OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel
With a look of concern he exits frame

BLUE BOOTS BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS and a METALLIC GREY

SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS
She holds up the sweater to her body smiles then puts
down the clothes and digs into lunch

EXT OTHER HOUSE - SAME

Coraline dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES steps onto
the FRONT PORCH and BURPS Its always nighttime in this
world

A CAT MEEEROWS Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on
the porch roof above her

Coraline raises her brows studies the animal a moment

CORALINE
Hmmm Wybies got a cat like you at
home Not the quiet Wybie the one that
talks too much You must be the Other
Cat

The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the
basement stairs He shakes his head and SPEAKS

CAT
No Im not the other anything Im me

He tips his head to one side opal blue eyes glinting
Coraline is surprised

CORALINE
Um I can see you dont have button
eyes But if youre the same cat how can
you talk
The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers

I just can

He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large

FALLEN TREE

CORALINE
Cats dont talk at home

No

CORALINE
Nope

Climbs up the trees upended roots head held high and
proud

CAT

(DRYLY)
Well youre clearly the expert on these
things After all Im just a big fat
wuss puss

CORALINE
Come back Please I Im sorry I
called you that I really am

Coraline forces herself to be polite
CORALINE (CONTD)
Howd you get here

CAT
Ive been coming here for a while

He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up
then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline
startling her

CAT (CONTD)
Its a game we play She
(indicates house)
hates cats and tries to keep me out
But she cant of course

He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole then POPS IT
UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE ten feet away

CAT (CONTD)
I come and go as I please

CORALINE

(SKEPTICAL)
The Other Mother hates cats

CAT

(CONTEMPTUOUS)
Not like any mother Ive ever known

CORALINE
What do you mean Shes amazing

Cat climbs the trees branches onto the roof
CAT
You probably think this world is a dream
come true But youre wrong The Other
Wybie told me so

CORALINE
Thats nonsense He cant talk

The cat looks at her pitying her lack of intelligence

CAT
Perhaps not to you We cats however
have far superior senses than humans and
can see and smell and --

Suddenly the cat drops into a crouch and freezes
sensing something

CAT (CONTD)
(WHISPERING)
Shhhh I hear something Right over

He SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the
corner

Coraline shrugs skeptical and heads down to Spink and
Forcibles their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS

INT MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLES OTHER APARTMENT - SAME

She pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an
enormous darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats anda
high WOODEN STAGE
A FLASHLIGHT comes towards her carried by a black
SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes He looks up at her sniffs
then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of
BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES to a front seat by the Other Wybie
She squeezes his arm hello he looks back warmly

CORALINE
Hey Wybie

Light flash the audience quiets then the curtains open
on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES OTHER MISS
SPINK rises up on stage left in a MERMAID SUIT large
WIG BUTTON EYES and UKULELE

CORALINE (CONTD)

(SHOCKED)
Shes practically naked

And Miss Spink sings

OTHER MISS SPINK
Im known as the siren of all seven seas
The breaker of hearts by the bay

A flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind
her

OTHER MISS SPINK (CONTD)
So if you go swimmin
With bow-legged women
I might steal your weak heart away

She bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their
tails

Spink is LOWERED through the stage floor the SCENERY
CHANGES and on the right a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up
with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE clad in the bare minimum -

her homage to Botticellis BIRTH OF VENUS Shes facing
the wrong way

CORALINE
(whisper to Wybie)
Oh my God

A dog HOWLS alerting the near-blind lady who turns to
the audience and begins the next verse

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through
the waves
And hope to lead sailors astray
But a true ocean goddess
Must fill out her bodice

(indicates her ample bosom)

To present an alluring display

The dogs thump and woof Wybie and Coraline clap

Spink furious at the greater reaction gets back in the

competition Rising up she makes it clear just who shes
dissing

OTHER MISS SPINK
Beware of old oysters too large in the
chest
Lets banish them from the buffet

But Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts
to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and
down competing

OTHER MISS SPINK (CONTD)
Im far more nutritious
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
You smell like the fishes

OTHER MISS SPINK
Did I hear a banshee

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

With a crash the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE
Coraline winces The audience HOWLS with laughter as the
curtains close on the disaster

Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where

panting then hears a piano note being hit over and over

INT OTHER FATHERS STUDY - SAME

EXT OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT FULL MOON

She runs out the back porch towards the Other Garden
OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL

She crosses the trail the Other House in the distance

ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD

She runs down the path

OTHER ORCHARD

Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES

AND RIPE RED FRUIT

Shes panting hard and has to slow to a fast walk The
further she goes the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
become

She hears the CAT MEROWWW Surprised she looks down

CAT
And what do you think youre doing

The cat trots along by her feet She blinks

CORALINE
Well Im gettin outta here Thats what
IM doing
The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become

WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES
CORALINE (CONTD)
Huh Somethings wrong Shouldnt the
old well be here

The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
way to a PALE EMPTY NOTHINGNESS No ground or shadows

CAT
Nothing out here its the empty part
of this world She only made what she
knew would impress you

CORALINE
But why Why does she want me

They walk over the horizon

CAT (contd)
She wants something to love I think
Something that isnt her Or maybe
shed just love something to eat

CORALINE
Eat Thats ridiculous mothers dont eat
daughters

CAT

I dont know How do you taste

OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS

A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and
becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE Coraline and the cat
slow then the front yard and topiary the sky hills
white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL

IN
CORALINE
Huh But how can you walk away from
something and still come back to it

The cat curls its tail into a question mark and tips its
head to one side

CAT
Walk around the world

CORALINE
Small world

Coraline shivers The cat suddenly TENSES focuses on a
shrub

CAT
Hang on--

He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE
KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET Before
Coraline can blink hes PINNED IT DOWN

CORALINE
Stop hes one of the circus mice

With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw the cat KNOCKS the mouse
into the air and catches it in his mouth He gives a
QUICK KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse
TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT Coraline is stunned He
drops the rat on the ground

CAT
I dont like rats at the best of times
but this one was sounding an alarm
The cat picks the rat up and heads off Slack-jawed
Coraline speaks with admiration

CORALINE
Gooooood kitty

Coraline looks to the house with a determined look

On the porch she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the
UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand

INT HOUSE OTHER HALLWAY - SAME

Coraline standing in front of the living room doors
TESTS the cane in her hands and peers down the hall for
danger Its dead quiet -- no piano no sounds of
anything

She JAMS the cane through the doors handles and PULLS
with all her might One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the
door swings open into the pitch black living room The
hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other
Little Door on the far wall cracked open She steps into
the room

INT OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path
blocking the little door and all around her things start
to glow The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing
BUG MUSEUM with all sorts of glowing living specimens
in the place of the old furniture and furnishings The
radiators are now big caterpillars the Nordic Track a
serving bug

The Other Mother speaks out startling Coraline

OTHER MOTHER (0OS)
They say even the proudest --

The sofa now a LARGE BUG turns in place to reveal her
sitting on it

OTHER MOTHER (CONTD)
--spirit can be broken with love

Shes all smiles button eyes shining one hand held out
in a behold my handiwork gesture

A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the
Other Mother

The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug

OTHER MOTHER (CONTD)
Of course chocolate never hurts Like
one

She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES

OTHER MOTHER (CONTD)
Theyre Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar

Coraline is disgusted The Other Mother takes back the
dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE Its the first thing
shes eaten in the film

CORALINE
I want to be with my real mom and dad I
want you to let me go

The Other Mother FROWNS swallows She speaks with a
FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice

OTHER MOTHER
Is that any way to talk to your mother

Coraline is mad and feeling mad makes her brave

CORALINE
You arent my mother

The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS Her button eyes now DEAD
stare into Coralines

OTHER MOTHER
Apologize at once Coraline

Coraline stares right back not blinking

CORALINE
No
OTHER MOTHER
(TENSELY)

Then she stands up GROWING TALLER

OTHER MOTHER (CONTD)

She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on

TALL OTHER MOTHER

THREE

This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and
DRAGS her to the hallway

CORALINE
Ow what are you doing

INT OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the
end Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her
fists

CORALINE
Ow that hurts

Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE
MIRROR as if it was water

INT CLOSET-PRISON BEHIND THE MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

Coraline HITS the ground hard The Tall Other Mother
head thrust through the mirror stares down at her
angrily
TALL OTHER MOTHER
You may come out when youve learned to
be a loving daughter

She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS

Coraline pounds on the mirror-door kicks it with her
blue boots A SOB wells up in her throat

And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN

She turns She can just make out a sagging iron bed When
the voice speaks there is a faint glow from beneath its
stained cover

CORALINE

(FRIGHTENED)
Whos there

TALL GIRL GHOST (0S)

(WHISPERS)
Hush And shush For the Beldam might be
listening

Coraline steps towards the bed the faint glow from under
the covers in sync with the words she hears

CORALINE

(WHISPERS)
You you mean the Other Mother

She gently pulls back the sheets
The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN BUTTON EYES
SIT UP a SWEET GIRL GHOST Coralines size a TALL GIRL
GHOST emotional a young BOY GHOST very sad

CORALINE (CONTD)
Who are you

BOY GHOST

(WISTFUL)
Dont remember our names But I ‘member

The boy dressed like Huck Finn CONJURES up ghost
flowers

The strange-looking flowers wither and fade Hes so sad
that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it

CORALINE
Why are you all here

ALL GHOSTS
The Beldam

The ghosts move about in a dance macabre like ghostly
fish in water

SWEET GIRL GHOST
She spied on our lives
through the little dolls eyes

BOY GHOST
And saw that we werent happy
TALL GIRL GHOST
So she lured us away

TALL GIRL GHOST (CONTD)
with treasures and treats

SWEET GIRL GHOST
and games to play

BOY GHOST
Gave all that we asked -

SWEET GIRL GHOST
yet we still wanted more -

TALL GIRL GHOST
So we let her sew the buttons

BOY GHOST
She said that she loved us

TALL GIRL GHOST
But she locked us here

ALL GHOSTS
And ate up our lives

The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down
Coraline is stunned She thinks a little and then speaks
trying to steady her voice

CORALINE
Well she cant keep me in the dark
forever

not if she wants to win my life

Beating her is my only chance

A beat

Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way

SWEET GIRL GHOST

Perhaps

if you do win your escape

you

could find our eyes

CORALINE

Has she taken those

too

SWEET GIRL GHOST

Yes miss

And hidden them

BOY GHOST

Find our eyes

Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to
STAB CORALINE Coraline yelps hands up in defense But
its CANDIES she attacks sending sticky chips flying
making loud grunts as she stabs

She pulls a LARGE THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from
the rubble and passes it to Coraline

INT PARENTS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coraline dressed for bed with her blanket over her
shoulder walks into her parents room the PHOTO of her
and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground

She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her
parents out of pillows She fits an extra neck brace on
one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other
Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers very
sad

CORALINE
Good-night Mom Good-night Dad

She kisses them both and BEGINS TO CRY CAM PUSHES IN

DISSOLVE TO

INT PARENTS BEDROOM - NIGHT LATER

Coraline asleep SOMETHING blurs past camera One paw
and then two paws bat her nose She opens her eyes to
find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her Its the BLACK CAT
purring loudly

CORALINE
Hello How did you get in

The cat yawns his eyes flash
CORALINE (CONTD)
Do you know where Mom and Dad are

The cat blinks Then he heads out the door

INT LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She follows him wrapped in her blanket to the MIRROR at
the end of the hallway The mirror starts to GLOW and
then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass Its HER PARENTS
They cling together blue with cold as snow falls

CORALINE

MOM DAD

They look up and with a desperate look Mel BREATHES on
the inside mirror-glass to fog it She writes H E L P U
S her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL
SAD BIRD Frost RISES UP hiding the letters and then her
parents The image fades

Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can GLASS
SHATTERS and she drops to the ground shaking The cat
nuzzles her

CORALINE (CONTD)
How did this happen

INT PARENTS BEDROOM - SAME

From under the bed the cat drags out the BUTTON-EYED
DOLL REMADE into HER MOTHER on one side and HER FATHER

on her face as the background DISSOLVES TO

INT LIVING ROOM FRONT OF FIREPLACE - SAME

CLOSE ON DOLL BURNING in the FIREPLACE

Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out She
takes a breath and looks up at the mantel

ANGLE ON snowglobe the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from

Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go
Pulls her collecting bag from the closet her puffy vest
her boots grabs a candle and garden shears puts them in
the bag She stands to go taking her cap off the chair
The ODD PIECE OF CANDY the triangle green one with the
hole drops to the floor She hesitates a moment then
sticks it in her bag

INT PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

We hear the click of the door being unlocked It opens to
reveal the cat and - holding a lit candle - Coraline
She leaves the key in the lock like always takes a
breath and crawls forward

The candle casts huge flickering shadows along the wall
The cat his voice returned SPEAKS to her

CAT

trap

CORALINE

With great feeling she explains

CORALINE (CONTD)
They are my parents

CAT

Coraline thinks about it remembering

CORALINE
Hmmm okay

The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open the candle
BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK Coraline
tenses when a voice calls out

MOTHER

She runs forward eagerly and--

INT OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
--out the Other Little Door throwing her arms out to hug
her real Mom

MOTHER
Darling
(voice shifting)
Why would you run away from me

Coraline sees her mothers hand GROW as it wraps around
her Alarmed she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow
into the TALL OTHER MOTHER

The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a
fireplace fire

Coraline tries her best to be brave

CORALINE
Where are my parents

The Tall Other Mothers button eyes GLITTER

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Gosh I have no idea where your old
parents are Perhaps theyve grown bored
of you and run away to France

Her teeth gleam

CORALINE

Other Father a FOOT SHORTER than before his sagging
face a pale PUMPKIN color his hair VINES comes up
behind Coraline

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Now dont be difficult Coraline Have a
seat wont you

Other Father GURGLING happily herds Coraline onto the
walking bug chair

The Tall Other Mother standing by the little door turns
to it and CLAPS her hands

A moment later a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -
FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and childrens things -
carrying the KEY from the real world door

The Tall Other Mother takes the key locks the door and -
while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she

SWALLOWS THE KEY

CORALINE

(OFFHAND)
Why dont you have your own key

OTHER FATHER
Only one key
The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear

SHUTTING HIS MOUTH

TALL OTHER MOTHER

She turns him around her hands under his arms and drags
him out

OTHER FATHER
Squish squash pumpkin sauce

After a beat Coraline hears the very faint SOUND OF A
FINGER ON GLASS just like when her mother wrote HELP on
the mirror Coraline jumps to her feet looking around
the room for a sign of her real parents

CORALINE
(loud whisper)
Mom Dad whered she hide you

A muffled screen door slams OS and the Tall Other
Mother calls to her from the kitchen

TALL OTHER MOTHER (0S)
Breakfast-time

Coraline leaves frame

INT OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Coraline pauses in the doorway

CORALINE (VO)
(to herself)
Be strong Coraline

She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place her
back to the sink

Tall Other Mother humming happily prepares a mushroom
omelet and bacon Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the
oven

At the tables center Coraline sees the box with her
BUTTON EYES with needle and thread A bead of sweat rolls
down her forehead As casually as she can she asks

CORALINE (CONTD)
(anxious trying to be cool)
Why dont we play a game I know you
like them

The Tall Other Mothers button eyes FLASH

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Everybody likes games

CORALINE
(NODS)
Uh huh

Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove

TALL OTHER MOTHER
What kind of game would it be

CORALINE)
An exploring game a finding things

Other Mother tries to act disinterested but her fingers
drum with excitement
OTHER MOTHER
And what is it youd be finding
Coraline

Coraline hesitates

CORALINE
My real parents

TALL OTHER MOTHER
(DISMISSIVE)

Too easy

She folds the omelet over in the pan

CORALINE
And and the eyes of the ghost children

Tall Other Mother smiles now its getting interesting

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Huh

The meal ready she turns from the stove and takes the
food to Coraline

TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONTD)
What if you dont find them

CORALINE
If I lose Ill stay here with you
forever and let you love me
(indicates button box)
And Ill let you sew buttons into my
eyes

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Hmmm And if you somehow win this game

CORALINE
Then you let me go You let everyone go

children everyone youve trapped here

The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million
years smile

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Deal

She holds out her hand Coraline doesnt reach

CORALINE
Not till you give me a clue

Tall Other Mother snorts her smile sours She slowly
circles Coraline and speaks as if talking to a very
stupid child

TALL OTHER MOTHER
Oh right In each of three wonders
Ive made just for you a ghosts eye is
lost in plain sight

CORALINE
And for my parents

Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the
sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON
EYE with her finger nail Coraline turns away from her

CORALINE (CONTD)
(SHRUGS)

Fine Dont tell me

Extending her hand Coraline starts to turn back

CORALINE (CONTD)
»its a deal--

But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping
now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink

Coraline EXHALES walks to the sink stares at the
dripping faucet

CORALINE (CONTD)
What does she mean wonders

Out the kitchen window the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP
answering her question She FURROWS HER BROWS thinks
this was too easy

CORALINE (CONTD)
Hmmm

CUT TO

EXT OTHER GARDEN - SAME
Coraline walks through the gates The bright magic of the
garden is DARKER NOW with areas of black against areas
of glowing flowers

She passes the PITCHER PLANTS and the one with the frog
suddenly SWALLOWS the animal

She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS which now
LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall

At the top a few SNAPDRAGONS feeble now SNAP at her
She KICKS them down Behind her a brick tree ring OPENS
like a monsters MOUTH and five HUGE PALE SNAPDRAGONS
sneak towards her They ATTACK knock her to the ground
spilling her bag

CORALINE
No

They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles knees hips waist and
shoulder and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE

MOUTH

Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS She CUTS
OFF one mutant snapdragons head then another until she
is free The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth

Coraline winded goes to gather her spilled things when
a trio of HUMMINGBIRDSWASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN They dont
attack her instead they poke their long beaks into the

TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF

CORALINE (CONTD)
Stop

Coraline chases them but theyre getting away As she
crosses the little bridge she takes off her cap and
FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them SCORE They fall to the
ground near the eyebrow shrubs sawdust spilling out
She picks up the triangle candy
CORALINE (CONTD)
Why steal this

With a look of what does she have to lose she holds it
up to her eye and GASPS

CORALINE (CONTD)
Wow

EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing all
color gone She scans the garden turning slowly As she
turns back to where she started she sees something
right in front of her a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOSTS

EYE

CORALINE (CONTD)
That must be it

She lowers the stone from her eye to see that the
ghosts eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the
preying mantis tractor which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF
HER with the Other Father a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN at its
controls his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL

PIANO HANDS

HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE The
mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS and
the tractor LURCHES at Coraline its arms SLASHING She
yells backs away Other Father calls in a garbled voice

OTHER FATHER
Sorrry so sorrry Motherrr making meeee

Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the
fountains as the tractor moves in
OTHER FATHER (CONTD)
Dont waaaanno hurrrrrt you

The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away but the
mechanical hands are stronger It moves onto the bridge -
STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it
Halfway over it lurches then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE
HOLE IT HAS CREATED The tractor hangs precariously for a
moment

Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand and with ONE
HAND FREE manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB

OTHER FATHER (CONTD)

Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the
tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE

WATER

Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave the entire

GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD

Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH shaken The ghost eyegear
knob GLOWS RED no magic candy necessary

BOY GHOST
Bless you miss you found me But
theres two eyes still lost

CORALINE
Dont worry Im getting the hang of it

Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other
House A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun the full moon a pale
acid green
Coraline looks concerned then resolved and then she
heads towards the house A haunting version of Spink and
Forcibles show song starts to play

behind the entry curtains She steps close pulls the
curtain open Song stops

POV ON THEATER quiet and dark save for light coming
through entry curtains She spots ushers FLASHLIGHT on
the ground

ON CORALINE - she picks it up clicks it on and STEPS
FORWARD She sweeps the light beam around apprehensive
then HEARS SOMETHING overhead She aims flashlight up and
startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scottieshalf bats
One bares his teeth and GROWLS She clicks off the light
and shivers

On stage one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge
wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY It hangs from ropes and
sandbags

She cautiously climbs up onto the stage A HUMAN-SIZED
TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be
seen through the wrapper She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-
WITH-HOLE to her eye There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming
from inside the wrapper

Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper steels
herself then reaches inside She touches something
sticky and cold and inhuman Clenching her teeth she
grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD TAFFY
HANDS - Young Spink and Forcibles

Her heart thumps She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like
scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed

CORALINE

(REALIZING)
The pearl

The hands suddenly GRAB HER She SCREAMS Young Spink and
Forcible twisted together into one taffy monster THRUST

THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG

TAFFY MONSTER
Thief Give it back

Coraline PULLS AWAY STRETCHING the candy arm out across
the stage The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired
arm and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE ropes
swaying on pulleys

TAFFY MONSTER (CONTD)
(in unison)
You thief Thief Thief Thief Give it
back Thief Give it back Give it back
Thief Stop thief Thief Stop

Coraline desperate gets an idea She clicks on her
flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS They GROWL with
annoyance OPEN their wings
The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER Coraline hurls the
flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM Angered they
TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned

Bat-dogs are closing on the left the taffy monster on
the right She waits to the very last second and then

DIVES OUT OF THE WAY

BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE Coralines hand is
released by the taffy hands leaving her the PEARL The
bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-
stone - turn to dead grey ash as does the stage and
theater

The PEARL in Coralines hand PULSES BLUE

towards the ceiling and beyond

CORALINE

OTHER MR BOBINSKY
(last breath)
Not even that anymore

Coraline pulls off his hat Instead of his head a HUGE
PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball It barks
at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar

RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS Coraline pulls
back HORRIFIED as the clothes collapse scanning around
for the circus ball

Theres a rat bark behind her and she turns The HUGE RAT
- balanced on a wheel of cheese circus ball in paws -
TAUNTS HER then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR She GIVES

CHASE

ribs she weaves and STUMBLES the shots landing like
punches
CORALINE
Ahhh No

A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -
appears in the front door as the rat approaches

Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-

WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE

Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as
hard as she can AT THE RAT

The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards

the RAT just outside

--OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
with ATTACHED STAIRWAY

CORALINE
Noooo

The whole rig with Coraline on top ROTATES as it
collapses THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the
house when it HITS THE GROUND She BLACKS OUT a moment

WHEEZING for breath Coraline pushes up on hands and
knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white
gravel driveway looking for the cheese-wheel rat and
circus ball No cheese-wheel rat no circus ball ghost
eye

Coraline lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light
turns to look at the moon Its nearly covered now by the

DARK BUTTON SHADOW

Her HAND stings from a scrape BLOOD trickles from her
knee She feels nothing but COLD LOSS

CORALINE (CONTD)

(DEVASTATED)
Oh God Ive lost the game Ive lost
everything

She sobs hugs knees and face to chest The band of light
that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone

In the foreground the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -
CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND Sawdust
leaks from its neck Band of light STOPS NARROWING the
eclipse paused

Theres a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up

Across from her on the front yard sits the BLACK CAT
licking his paws rats head and circus ball at his feet

CAT
I think I mentioned that I dont like
rats at the best of times

Coraline smiles walks towards him

CORALINE
I think you might have said something
like that

CAT
It looked like you needed this one
however

He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline

She picks it up sticks it in her bag Around her the

YARD HOUSE TREES SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY

CORALINE
Thank you

Looks towards house

CORALINE (CONTD)
Im heading inside I still have to find
my parents
cut To

ANGLE ON MOON The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN and in
one beat the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED
OUT The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY

ON CORALINE WITH CAT A strange insect thrumming has
begun What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of
paper are falling Confused she looks up to see

The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the
SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL revealing dirty white
light The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant
hills the sound of a million invisible locusts growing
louder

UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE The cat hisses Deeply
alarmed they look from one direction to another

POV out front yard The destruction TRAVELS up the
driveway PULLS APART the poplars and then UNRAVELS the
topiary elephant and bird

DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat his TAIL TWITCHING WE
PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY

SHRINKING ISLAND

NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their
feet STARTS CRACKING white light coming through Cat
makes a fearful sound afraid for the first time in the
movie

Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal her
guardian angel

CORALINE (CONTD)
Come on quickly
The cat LEAPS and she catches him then CARRIES HIM up
the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door She
gets through just in time and SLAMS it shut

INT OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME

Its dark and stable in here with just some creaks and
intermittent vibrations A poisonous green light spills
from the other living room

Coraline goes there carrying the cat over her shoulder
past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes to the room
where she last heard the sound of her mothers finger on
glass

INT OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME

A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS
in the fireplace The bug furniture looks grey now their
lights flickering as if short-circuited legs and wings
twitching uncontrollably

Coraline scans the walls the ceiling looking for a sign
of her parents

ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground She senses the Other
Mother behind her a creature who is no sort of Mother at
all but a witch a Beldam She turns

The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden

BELDAM
So youre back
Her voice sounds dry and tired She turns her face
towards Coraline It is a WHITE DEATH MASK cracked and
peeling - her true face

BELDAM (CONTD)
And you brought vermin with you

Coraline shudders and steps back The cat makes a fearful
sound and digs his claws into her shoulder

CORALINE
No I I brought a friend

The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL She is WITHERED to the
bone with plate-like shoulders and hips her bustle now
an arachnids tail section Her true form

She reaches her long sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to
Coralines face

BELDAM
(FLATLY)

You know I love you

Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is

CORALINE
You you have a very funny way of showing
it

The Beldam smiles turns away then back her hand
outstretched

BELDAM
So Where are they - the ghost eyes
Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and
starts to hand them over But she catches herself

CORALINE
Hold on

And pulls back

CORALINE (CONTD)
We arent finished yet are we

The Beldam looks daggers then smiles sweetly

BELDAM
No I suppose not After all you still
need to find your old parents dont you
Too bad you wont have this

She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and
FLINGS it into the green fire The Beldam laughs while
the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops

ON CORALINE The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT
in her hand Coraline turns away so the witch wont see

SWEET GIRL GHOST (0S)
Be clever miss even if you win shell
never let you go

Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the
armoire bug and understands shes got to get the Beldam
to unlock it She furrows her brow as an idea comes to
her then nods

She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she
can muster says
CORALINE
I already know where youve hidden them

The Beldam turns from the fire both concerned and
sceptical

BELDAM
Well produce them

Coraline points to the little door

CORALINE
Theyre behind that door

The Beldam leans close knowing Coraline is wrong and
speaks very quietly

BELDAM
Oh they are are they

A smile creeps onto her terrible face And she STARTS
TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR moving in an odd laboring way
as if she had four legs instead of two She signals the
armoire bug to stand aside her back to Coraline

Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mothers finger on
wet glass Looks around desperate - where is it coming
from

The cats ears twitch and focus and then he SEES
SOMETHING on the mantel He whispers to Coraline --

There
-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -

OPAQUE WITH FROST

CU ON SNOW-GLOBE With a SOFT-CHIRP a section of glass
is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see
the tiny cold figures that are CORALINES TRAPPED
PARENTS Coralines heart races She purposely stays back
from them

CORALINE

(WHISPERING)
Mom Dad

ON BELDAM by little door Oblivious to Coralines
discovery she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand She turns
to Coraline expectantly

CORALINE (CONTD)
Go on Open it Theyll be there all
right

The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock turns
it leaves the key in place

She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low sing-song
voice

BELDAM
Youre wrong Coraline

She opens the little door revealing the empty spider-
web tunnel

ON CORALINE who glances from the open door to the cat -
obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam Shes
thinking very hard
BELDAM (CONTD)
(PITYING)
They arent there

She opens her hands one holds box with Coralines BLACK
BUTTON EYES the other a THREADED NEEDLE Triumphant the
Beldam softly gloats

BELDAM (CONTD)
Now youre going to stay here forever

Coraline strikes a warriors pose and summons all the
fury she can

CORALINE
No Im
She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER

HEAD

CORALINE (CONTD)

NOT

And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam The YOWLING ANIMAL -
face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and
lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCHS HEAD

FREAKED-OUT the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the
shrieking Beldam who STAGGERS to one side of the little
door

Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside
stows it in her bag and moves out to approach the door
from the other side
The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat The cat HOWLS LIKE A
BANSHEE RAISES HIS CLAWS and - quick as you can - TWO

SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAMS EYES

ANGLE ON CAT as hes thrown on armoire bug

ON BELDAM hands covering her face

BELDAM

NOOO0O000000

Her hands pull away to show EMPTY FLAT SOCKETS and TORN

THREAD

BELDAM (CONTD)
You horrible cheating girl

She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral
of floorboards that drive Coraline to the rooms center
A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR

The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT
There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS

The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture
straight to the little door and disappears into the
tunnel

Coraline falls the very bottom of the web

Fifty feet above the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS
DOWN like a huge flying spider

Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the
trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS
The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around
grasping blindly

BELDAM (CONTD)
Noo Where are you You selfish brat

Coraline nearing the top looks up and spots the LITTLE
DOOR still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room
She goes to climb back inside the web when her bag GETS
CAUGHT on a barb She pulls and pulls until it breaks

free sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB

TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM

BELDAM (CONTD)
Hahahaha

The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now

Coraline makes it to the little door but the BELDAM IS

COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST

BELDAM (0S) (CONTD)

YOU DARE

INT PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door KEY IN HAND and
grabs the doors handle Before she can shut it the

BELDAMS HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE
BELDAM

DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER

Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE knocking her back The
cat takes off down the tunnel

Coraline nearly shuts the door when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB
HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN

CORALINE

PLEASE SHUT

The ghost childrens FLUTTERY DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT
FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINES HANDS that grip
the doors handle And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED

The door STARTS TO SHUT The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY
at Coraline reaching through the closing gap with one
thin claw Theres a final moment of resistance - the
Beldams wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then
SNAP The DOOR SHUTS and the Beldams hand drops to the
ground

She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement

Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when
it is POUNDED from the other side green light coming
through cracks She takes off down the tunnel stooped
down as fast as she can

The pounding grows more insistent green light flashing

BELDAM (0S)

DONT LEAVE ME DONT LEAVE ME ILL

DIE WITHOUT you
And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW
SHORTER like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far
door with the blind one-handed Beldam on the other side

STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER

Ahead DAYLIGHT APPEARS and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE

REAL WORLD

INT REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway SHUTS AND
LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT A split-
second later the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
CRASH Coraline is THROWN BACK But the real-world door
and lock hold Its over

Coraline lies on her back as beat-up and tired as shes
ever been GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows
a little The room is brightly lit by sunlight the first
since she moved here and the sky out the windows is blue
with white clouds

n

he smiles remembering and turns to her bag with the
ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside

She opens it up and searches shoving aside ghost eyes
and garden shears But the snow globe is GONE

She gets on all fours starts searching the floor Her
hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace with tiny
bits of BLUE SNOW A drip plops down then another She
looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE
She stands up and finds that its BROKEN OPEN and
neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside

As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe
Coralines face clouds with confusion and fear What does
this mean and where are her parents Then her WONDERFULLY
REAL MOTHER calls to her

MEL (0S)
Coraline Were home

Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway a
dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair

CORALINE

Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around
them

MEL

Mel notices the broken snow globe

MEL (CONTD)
Oh no you broke my favorite snow globe

CORALINE

Charlie crouches low clutching his briefcase

Mel tells

CORALINE

But look at the snow on your clothes
But the snow melts without a trace

MEL

(CONFUSED )

Her parents walk off Coraline shrugs her shoulders and
looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel She
cocks her head deeply puzzled then leaves the room

DISSOLVE TO

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT SKY CLEAR

The VW is parked out front its interior light fading as
light in Coralines bedroom window switches on We HEAR
Charlie make a strangled sound

INT CORALINES BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING

Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED
wounds-dressed hair shining The KEY hangs from a string
around her neck A gibbous moon shines in the clear night
sky

Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like its
an alien face-hugger then FEIGNING DEATH falls on the
bed Coraline LAUGHS

CORALINE
So gonna order the tulips
He opens one eye pretends hes never heard about this

CHARLIE
Whats that

CORALINE
For the garden party

He sits up and kids her tickling her face with the
squid

CHARLIE

CORALINE

She turns to Mom arranging things on a shelf

CORALINE (CONTD)
So Mom Invitations Dont forget the
invitations

Her mother nods points up

MEL
Even Bobinsky

CORALINE
Mr Bs not drunk Mom hes
justeccentric
Charlie LAUGHS He bends down to kiss her

CHARLIE
Good night Coraline

As he steps away Mel slips a slim box under the covers
next to her daughter She gives Coraline a told you so
look and she and Charlie leave the room

Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - its the
GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES shed wanted She pulls one on to
admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window

CORALINE
Oh hello again

She walks over to the window opens it

CORALINE (CONTD)
You still mad

His expression says yes hes still mad

CORALINE (CONTD)
Im really sorry I threw you at her - the
Other Mother it was all I could think
of

The cats angry expression softens He rests his head on
her hand licking her fingers and purrs

Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and
carries him over to her bed

She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large
PEARL the CIRCUS BALL and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB She
holds them out to the cat
CORALINE (CONTD)
I think its time dont you To set them
free

The cat nods She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow
and gently lays down the cat lying beside her The two
of them close their eyes and in no time at all they
doze off to sleep WE SLOWLY TILT UP

MATCH MOVE DISSOLVE TO

EXT DREAMSCAPE - MAGIC TIME

A MAGIC ART SKY animates subtly

CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline studying sky her back to us
From behind CAM CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to
shine on her She turns toward us shielding her eyes

Coralines eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE
GHOST CHILDREN now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS EYES
RESTORED small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS

SWEET GIRL GHOST
Its a fine fine thing you did for us
miss

CORALINE
Well Im glad its finally over

A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children They
gather around Coraline and bow their heads
SWEET GIRL GHOST

(SIGHS)
It is over and done with for us
Silent beat
CORALINE

What aboutme

The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably then BLURTS

OUT

TALL GIRL GHOST
Youre in terrible danger girl

Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation

CORALINE
But how I locked the door

SWEET GIRL GHOST
Its the key miss theres only one and
the Beldam will find it

The KEY ON THE STRING around Coralines neck floats out
in front of Coraline She grabs it

The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly

BOY GHOST

(WHISPERS)
Taint all bad miss Thou art alive
thou art still living

They begin to swirl around her spinning faster and
faster Coraline starts to turn and then she --

CUT TO

INT CORALINES BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED FAST PULL BACK
above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by
her side

Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES
ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs She takes out the
key on its string and explains to the cat her voice

PANICKED

CORALINE
I -- Ive gotta hide this somewhere s-
somewhere she can never

The cat doesnt like the sound of this Coraline grabs
her blanket and heads to her door But the cat leaps down
and blocks her way

CORALINE (CONTD)
Outta my way

She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room The cat glares
after her
INT HOUSE STAIRWAY LOWER HALL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads
down the hall She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits
frame CAMERA stays on living room where on the LITTLE
DOOR in the corner wall SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE

WE ROCKET IN AND--

JUMP CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE Through the narrow gap at
the doors bottom the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM
CRAWLS OUT It scrambles out of frame in the direction of
Coraline

EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME

Coraline moves briskly the house below GRIPPING THE KEY
thats tied round her neck DARK ROPEY CLOUDS reach like
fingers across the gibbous moon Coraline sings her
fathers nonsense song her voice hardly trembling

CORALINE
Oh my twitchy witchy girl
I think you are so nice

EXT ORCHARD - SAME
She moves down past the old fruit trees now covered with
BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow

CORALINE
I give you bowls of porridge
And I give you bowls of ice cream

LOW ANGLE ON Coraline moving away The BELDAMS HAND
drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her

CORALINE (CONTD)
I give you lots of kisses
And I give you lots of hugs

EXT WELL - SAME

Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the
wells cover lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK

CORALINE
But I never give you sandwiches
With grease and worms and mung beans

Circling around behind the BIG STUMP the HAND SCAMPERS
behind one rock to a bush to a tree coming closer

Coraline manages to lever the wells cover off to one
side leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN Huffing and sweating
she wipes her brow then takes the key string thats
around her neck

The hand SEEING what is about to happen RACES TOWARDS

HER
Coraline lifts string and key not quite over her head

The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the
air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND

Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM her fingers caught
between the key string and her neck

The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the

LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION

A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE an AIR HORN
SOUNDS and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his
own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining
electric bike

WYBIE

YAHHHHH

Wybie GUNS the throttle and leaning out GRABS the
confused HAND with his slug tongs

He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL readying to
throw the hand in But the HAND GETS FREE and GRABS his
handlebars

OUT OF CONTROL Wybies bike HITS A ROCK and WYBIE AND
HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL HOLLERING he just
manages to hang on with one hand The Beldams hand
caught on Wybies coattail SCRAMBLES UP his body and
face and onto the wells edge where it STABS AT HIS
FINGERS to make him fall

WYBIE (CONTD)

(STRUGGLING)
Get off
Coraline choking rises to her feet She grabs her
BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the
crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND
It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it
The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF It
crouches to attack her

And then WYBIE IS BACK pumped with adrenaline a BIG
ROCK raised over his head He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
LEAPING HAND And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES

Wybie struggles to catch his breath Coraline - breathing
hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
neck She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
needles on it - around the rock and ties it all together
with the string The key is left attached

The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and

DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE By the light of a stray moonbeam
they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
the dark water at the bottom They slide the well cover

in place

Still catching his breath Wybie stands holding his
injured hand its glove ripped by the Beldams claw He
looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little
with moonlight

WYBIE (CONTD)
I-Im really sorry I didnt believe you
about all this evil stuff Coraline

Coraline shoulders rising as she catches her breath
stands and smiles he called her by real name for the
first time

CORALINE
Why did you change your mind

He walks over and takes out an old BandW photo from his
jacket

WYBIE
W-well Gramma showed me this picture
after I called you crazy

He hands it to her

ANGLE ON PHOTO two light-skinned black girls - dressed
in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink
Palace before it was divided into apartments One looks
just like the sweet ghost girl and holds the DOLL WITH
BUTTON EYES which looks just like her

WYBIE (0C) (CONTD)
Its her and her sister before she
disappeared

ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE Behind them blossoms fall
like snow in the orchard

CORALINE
The sweet ghost girl

Wybies grandmother loud and worried calls from the
distance

WYBIES GRANDMOTHER (0C)
Wyborne Come home

WYBIE
(re his grandmother)
Oh manwhat am I going to tell her

She looks up from the photo and smiles
CORALINE
Just bring her by the house tomorrow We
can tell her together

WYBIE
Wewe can

CORALINE
You know Im glad you decided to stalk
me

She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS

WYBIE
Wasnt my idea

The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS
Coraline smiles

We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds -
like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright
gibbous moon

DISSOLVE TO

EXT HOUSE GARDEN - DAY

One WHITE BALLOON floats against a blue sky with puffy
white clouds WE TILT DOWN past more balloons to a TABLE
OF REFRESHMENTS set up by the front gates

Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her
hard-working GUESTS all wearing garden gloves and
showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED
RED TULIPS

SPINK AND FORCIBLE along with their DOGS are set up at
a table below the steps Empty plant cartons are stacked
nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of
peat moss

CORALINE
Thanks for helping me Miss Spink Miss
Forcible

MISS FORCIBLE
(straining to see)
Oh look April - Pink Ladies

CORALINE

Coraline hands them the beverages then nods towards the
GREY DOG digging in the flowers

CORALINE (CONTD)
Hows Angus doing

Miss Spink sighs

MISS SPINK
Oh much better dear But he cant
duck his wings forever

Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a
heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in
the stone circle

CORALINE

Coraline delighted moves on
Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained
fish pond Hes stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips
from the dirt there and putting BEETS in their place

MR BOBINSKY (0S)

Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT to get his attention

his activities She smiles and hands him a drink

He drains his glass of lemonade A familiar voice is
heard approaching Coraline turns and smiles

the garden gates

CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and
BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front
On top of the sign sits the black cat who looks right
into camera blinks then walks behind the thin post that
holds the sign and DISAPPEARS
