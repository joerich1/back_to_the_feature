FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 050715
EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 1

The faces of FIVE MEN appear out of a thick cloud of mist
rising off a seething lake of boiling water They look like
pale phantoms Terrified

We HEAR the voice of FATHER CHRISTOVAO FERREIRA Strong
Resolute

FERREIRA (VO)
(reading)
Good Friday 1633 Pax Christi
Praised be God Although for us there
is little peace in this land now

CUT TO

EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 2

Now we see FERREIRA He is a Jesuit priest A missionary But

the look on his face does not match the reflective tone of the
voice we are hearing He is troubled at something he sees He

turns away

-but two GUARDS holding him force him to look back Vapors
of steam make them seem like creatures in a dream

FERREIRA (VO)
(reading)
I never knew Japan when it was a
country of light But I have never
known it to be as dark as it is now”

On those last words Ferreira is pulled through the steam
into close-up He struggles not to show the pain of what he
sees

EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 3

The five men are surrounded by SAMURAI and various OFFICIALS
Guards are pushing them forward The five men are THREE
AUGUSTINIAN FRIARS a FRANCISCAN FRIAR and a JAPANESE JESUIT
PRIEST

FERREIRA(VO)
“All our progress has ended in new
persecution new repression new
suffering

(MORE)
FERREIRA(VO) (contd)
The governor of Nagasaki first hoped
to destroy our Christian faith with
ridicule and by example”

Steam from the hot spring ebbs briefly to reveal the men are
Catholic priests Their hands are tied The water in front of
them is like a cauldron

FERREIRA (VO)
“But when the faithful resisted and
refused to renounce God he became
more cruel

In a grove of trees on a small rise in the near distance the
Guards hold tight to the priest Ferreira making sure he
doesn’t miss a thing They yank Ferreira like a dog on a rope
Closer to the spring

CUT TO

EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 4
The five priests tremble at the edge of the scorching spring

FERREIRA (VO)
He took four friars and one of our
own Society to Unzen There are hot
springs there The Japanese call them
‘hells partly I think in mockery
and partly I must tell you in
truth

The cold air makes the STEAM rise thickly from the lake

FERREIRA (VO)
The officials told the faithful to
abandon God and the gospel of His
love But they not only refused to
apostatize They asked to be tortured
so they could demonstrate the strength
of their faith and the presence of God
within them

The water throws scalding spray into the air burning the face
of one of the priests

Nearby still guarded by the samurai Ferreira bites his lip to
control himself His lip bleeds He watches as

the captured priest turns unbroken to his captors
refusing to capitulate
CAPTURED PRIEST
Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ
(alt Soul of Christ sanctify me)

Showing no anger an Official makes an abrupt gesture Guards
tear off the priests’ garments then dip long-handled ladles
into the boiling water of the spring

EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 5

Seen now from a distance as if on a stage guards approach the
five Christian prisoners who are tied nearly naked to wooden
stakes The guards DRIP the scalding water onto their bodies

FERREIRA (VO)
They used ladles filled with holes so
the drops would come out slowly and
the pain would be prolonged Each
small splash of the water was like a
burning coal

The crowd surges forward

FERREIRA
Some remained on the mountain for 33
days

CUT TO

EXT UNZEN HOT SPRINGS DAY 6

A month later Still from a distance The five Christians are
being untied from the stakes Their bodies are wracked from the
effects of exposure

FERREIRA (VO)
“The story of their courage has become
almost legend They give hope to those
of us who remain here against the
shogun’s order to teach the faith We
only grow stronger in His love”

Near the hot spring Ferreira collapses to the ground His
guard lets him fall He hides his face in his arms

TITLE UP COLLEGE OF MADRE DE DEUS MACAO Spring 1640 A
hand places a letter on a desk and Father Valignano removes his

spectacles reciting the last words of the letter He knows
them well

VALIGNANO
Ferreira is lost to us
(looks up)
This was his last letter

Valignano is a compelling man the senior Jesuit superior of
this mission on the very edge of the known world He looks
across at TWO YOUNG PRIESTS neither older than thirty who are
seated before him

One priest FRANCISCO GARUPE who has the lean restless
appearance of a hunting animal looks thoughtful He is
measuring his response

-when the second priest speaks He has an aspect of spiritual
assurance about him of untested righteousness but there is a

hungry haunted look in his eyes too Hes like a man who has

seen his own ghost His name is SEBASTIAO RODRIGUES

RODRIGUES
That was so long ago It says nothing
of him now

VALIGNANO
This letter came to us when you were
traveling from Portugal It took years
to reach us It was hidden smuggled
ransomed and finally put into my hand
by a Dutch trader Who had other news
as well

RODRIGUES
That he is alive

VALIGNANO
That he apostatized

The young priests are stunned

VALIGNANO
That he denounced God in public and
surrendered the faith and is now
living as a Japanese
GARUPE
That’s not possible (Father Ferreira
risked his life to spread our faith
all over Japan We are here today
because of him)

RODRIGUES
He was the strongest of us

VALIGNANO
He wrote those words during the most
sweeping persecution of all Now
things are even worse Thousands are
dead for what we brought them
Thousands more have given up the
faith

GARUPE
You said this trader brought news But
it’s not proven is it It could be a
slander created to further discredit
our faith

VALIGNANO
Given the extent of the persecution in
that country

GARUPE
Yes Father respectfully There must
be multitudes there who need us too

VALIGNANO
(more emphatically now)
--and the fact there has been no
other word of him and the news
brought by the Dutchman

GARUPE
Rumor Father only

Rodrigues gestures to Garupe to moderate his tone as Valignano
fixes him with a look of stern impatience Garupe lowers his
head in apology

VALIGNANO
I must conclude it is true

RODRIGUES
If it is true Father what would it
mean for the Society For our faith
For all of Catholic Europe

(MORE)
RODRIGUES (contd)
Father it seems our mission here is
more urgent than ever We must find
Father Ferreira

VALIGNANO
I cannot allow that

GARUPE
But you can’t allow us to abandon our
mission

VALIGNANO

Your mission was to find word of
Ferreira You have found it Take this
letter with you and return to
Portugal

RODRIGUES
Excuse me Father but the letter
relates a terrible history It says
nothing about Ferreira himself
Whatever happened to him is still
unknown All we know of his fate is a
slander Permit me Father Valignano
but I believe our mission still
stands

EXT STEPS OF A GREAT CATHEDRAL DAY 8

Valignano walks with the young priests down the steps of the
cathedral The great cathedral looms behind them Fog hangs in
the air like clumps of cotton Outlines of ships in the harbor
can be seen in the distance occasionally a MAST breaks through
the fog swaying with the roll of the tide then disappearing
again

VALIGNANO
If I permit you to go on to Japan
Id be condemning you This
Inquisitor this Inouehe is
terror itself He may not be the
devil but he is just as cunning
And he was baptized

(beat)

By me during my ministry Do you know
how many Christians the authorities
executed at Shimabara Thousands
Tens of thousands Most beheaded

RODRIGUES
Each a martyr
GARUPE
We must honor their memory and ask for
their prayers And we cannot abandon
whoever remains

Valignano is wavering swayed by the passion and idealism of
the young men And they know that

VALIGNANO
(a beat then)
No any missionary work in Japan of
any kind is now out of the question
for us The only European ships
permitted to enter port in Japan are
Dutch

GARUPE
Can the Dutch

VALIGNANO
The Dutch are heretics Religion is
just a business advantage to them No
it is far too dangerous for you

RODRIGUES
But how can we neglect a man who
nurtured us in the faith He shaped
the world for us (ALT1 He showed us
our calling)(ALT2 HE formed us as
Jesuits)

GARUPE
And even if this slander should be
true then Father Ferreira is damned

RODRIGUES
And we have no choice but to save his
soul Father

VALIGNANO
This is in your hearts then Both of
you

RODRIGUES
Yes

GARUPE

It is Like our first fervor (ALT
Like our first fervor we felt in the
novitiate We feel it is a call
Father)
VALIGNANO
Then I must trust God has put it
there He calls you to a great trial
From the moment you set foot in that
country you step into high danger

Rodrigues and Garupe walk briskly past the crowded docks of the
island waterfront A misty rain falls Junks are so closely
moored that their hulls make a scraping thumping SOUND like a
muffled cadence

The Europeans take broad strides the length of their step and
their height makes the Chinese population clogging the street
and congregating around the wharves give way before them A
CHINESE BUSINESSMAN has to almost trot to keep up

RODRIGUES (VO)
“May 25 1640 Pax Christi God be
praised Father Valignano as I begin
these lines I cannot be sure that
when they are done they will ever
reach you”

The Chinese Businessman bustles ahead of the priests and
gestures for them to follow him down a narrow alley

RODRIGUES (VO)
“But I want to maintain your
confidence in our mission and
vindicate your faith in us”

The Chinese Businessman stands at the entrance to a TAVERN
gesturing for the Priests to step inside Rodrigues enters
first with Garupe close behind him

As the Chinese Businessman hovers in the background the two
priests stoop to fit into this dank low place Seamen and
traders drink steadily at rough tables Others pass by with
women who seem to be holding them up as they pass through the
shadows There is a MOAN from the corner of the room

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN
He is not much You will see

There is another MOAN The Chinese Businessman bolts forward
and plunges into this heap of shadows

-pulling the body of a MAN (KICHIJIRO) into the feeble light
The disbelieving priests stare at the heap of humanity lying
before them He is their age ragged and rough-skinned

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN (contd)
But after almost two months he is the
only one

GARUPE
Are you Japanese

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN
Yes yes He was drifting on sea
Portuguese bring him

GARUPE
Are you really Japanese

RODRIGUES
Where are you from

Kichijiro crawls back into the comfort of the shadows The
Chinese Businessman stops him with a kick Kichijiro turns on
him groaning incoherently The Chinese Businessman takes a
prudent step back

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN

RODRIGUES

Listen to me We have money Help us
and we can take you home We can

Kichijiro abruptly INTERRUPTS Rodrigues HURLING himself at the
feet of the surprised priests He grovels weeping

KICHIJIRO
I want to go home Not for money
Japan is the country of my family
Please Take me please I beg you
Don’t abandon me here

The Chinese Businessman stares at the abject Kichijiro
Rodrigues nods his head slightly in silent assent and Kichijiro
immediately prostrates himself in drunken thanks The Chinese
Businessman helps Kichijiro up to leave

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN
You see He will be very good guide
He will be good

As they make their way out Kichijiro falls drunk onto a table
knocking into a man (Chinese Portuguese) The man pushes
Kichijiro away Kichijiro tries to stand up when he is pushed
again (attacked) He cowers and begs Rodrigues and Garupe
react The Chinese Businessman tries to protect them Rodrigues
and Garupe go to Kichijiro on the floor to stop the violence
They help him up and hand him to the Chinese Businessman

GARUPE
Our guide He can’t be a Christian

RODRIGUES
He says he’s not but can you believe
anything he says

The Chinese Businessman takes Kichijiro away down the alley
the taverners laugh

GARUPE
I don’t even want to believe he’s
Japanese

CHINESE BUSINESSMAN
(shouting back to priests)
You see He will be good

The priests look at Kichijiro

RODRIGUES (VO)
And he said to them Go ye into the
whole world and preach the gospel to
every creature Even to one such as

Kichijiro surfaces and LURCHES toward the land

animals being pursued by hunters they can only sense As soon
as they reach shelter Kichijiro is gone It startles them

GARUPE

betray us

Their fear increases at the SOUND of something moving across
the rocky beach Footsteps Drawing closer They huddle
together caked with soggy sand and dirt a couple of
landlocked sea rats

RODRIGUES
“Quod facis fac citius” “What
you will do do quickly

Rodrigues and Garupe press themselves deep in the shadows of

Garupe reaches for his companion and holds his head against his
chest trying to MUFFLE the sound

A band of soldiers went there with
lanterns and torches and weapons

The priests duck back behind their meager shelter as
a LIGHT FLARES suddenly just in front of them

The sound of feet close now And VOICES The priests exchange
a FRIGHTENED GLANCE then turn to see

the craggy glowering face of an OLD MAN looming over them
His very lack of expression is menacing He studies them for a
moment A long agonizing moment

OLD MAN (ICHIZO)
Padre

The priests are stunned to hear this word in their language
The old man makes the sign of the cross Tentatively
trembling Garupe blesses him

carrying torches surround them

with field hats and farmers’ overgarments In their midst
Kichijiro smiles at them with servile pride

RODRIGUES

The way of the Lord surpasses all
understanding

With Kichijiro always near the villagers form a protective
phalanx as they guide them off the beach

RODRIGUES (VO)

sounded so foreign here But they were
a sign that the seed of our faith has
been sown and survives with tenacity
Now it is our mission to tend and
nurture it lest it wither and die”

path and thrashes his way through the woods The others follow
The priests stumble trying to keep up The going is hard The

villagers don’t give a moment to rest They press on hard

RODRIGUES (VO)
“We were hurried to shelter because
our Christians feared betrayal by
those who had not embraced the faith
Gentiles they called them Although
nearly all the two hundred families of
Tomogi had been baptized many fell

Two hundred for a Kirishitan brother
And for a priest three hundred

GARUPE

Three hundred I’m flattered

RODRIGUES
You should go to the other villages
let them know priests are here again
In Japan again That would be good
You must let them know

Ichizo nods polite agreement but Rodrigues can see he hasnt
persuaded him It is as he reaches for his meager bowl of food
again that he notices Ichizo has not been eating

RODRIGUES
(to Ichizo)
You do not eat

ICHIZO
It is you who feed us

Rodrigues is struck by the simplicity and force of the answer
As he bends over his bowl his NECKLACE WITH A CRUCIFIX
ATTACHED SWINGS FREE across his chest

hands make an involuntary movement toward the crucifix

Heavy RAIN pelts the charcoal hut running off the straw roof
in great streams and LEAKING inside Garupe and Rodrigues are
PICKING lice off their clothes using their fingers as tweezers
Garupe mutters something under his breath

GARUPE
“Joy of my heart”

RODRIGUES
What

GARUPE

“We shall never find another race to
equal the Japanese They are the joy
of my heart” Our Saint Francis
Xavier’s words He must not have come
across any lice The only way we can
win against these things is to get out
of here

Rodrigues tweezes several small white lice with his fingers
Frustrated Garupe picks up a rock and pounds at them

GARUPE (contd)
(pummeling the lice)
Im sorry I know thats weak
(WHACK )
But all I feel for these people is
pity not love

RODRIGUES
I know I feel pity too
(beat)
Our Saint Francis also told us to
render an account first to God then
to our own conscience Then we can do
much good for our neighbors

GARUPE
Do you think we have Done good

RODRIGUES
Yes I do Of course I do

GARUPE
Much good

Rodrigues wipes his hands and passes Garupe a small bowl of
roots and pumpkin scraps

GARUPE
It’s just that these people are so
frightened Is fear all they have
(WHACK )
And lice

RODRIGUES
They have us We comfort them

GARUPE
How much longer can we do that

RODRIGUES
We asked for this mission Francisco
We begged Father Valignano for it We
prayed for it in the Exercises God

Then may He guide us to Ferreira So
we can know the truth

GARUPE
The truth

RODRIGUES
Do you think there’s any doubt

About what

RODRIGUES
You think his strength gave out and he
groveled in front of the Inquisitor
Inoue Went on his knees like a dog

GARUPE
That’s still just a rumor Even if
this Inoue is the devil everyone
claims Ferreira would stand up to
him

RODRIGUES
You don’t seem so certain Francisco
(no reply from Garupe)
One of us has to go to Nagasaki and
find him

GARUPE
It’s too dangerous If we’re caught
there will be terrible reprisals to
the people who shelter us

RODRIGUES
Then Kichijiro can go and bring back
word we can act on

GARUPE
Are you mad Where is he Kichijiro’s
never sober You know he can’t be
trusted

RODRIGUES
So we stay here like this No We must
do something to find Father Ferreira

Garupe bangs his food bowl down on another swarm of lice

There is a SOUND as of distant thunderand A RIDERLESS HORSE
GALLOPS through the cloud of dust and out of the village

From a hiding place on a hill just above the village Rodrigues
and Garupe watch silently fearfully

The dust cloud dissipates revealing armed samurai moving
inexorably forward

The samurai stare impassively ahead at the entire population of
the village assembled down the length of the dirt street all
trying to hide their fear Expecting the worst

And the villagers look up at the sound of another horsethis
one moving slowly It carries the SAMURAI COMMANDER who looks
down at the villagers with level and chilling indifference
Behind him is another rider an OLD SAMURAI wearing a huge
black hat like an umbrella He smiles at the villagers
benevolently

Behind him roughneck GUARDS lead a prisoner on foot The man
is tightly bound and pulled along harshly It is Ichizo

over the people

thing if you leave More of us would

be saved

Garupe and Rodrigues don’t understand what is being said but
from the fact that it is spoken in Japanese--and so angrily--
they know it does not bode well

Youcan’t say that They came to do

God’s work We can’t just give them up
to Inoue’s tortures after all they

have done for us

bones that remained were scattered in

still planted firm in the moonlit sand

RODRIGUES (VO)
“IT had long read about martyrdom in
The Lives of the Saints but this was
no such glorious thing Surely God
heard their prayers as they died But
did He hear their screams I prayed
that He might reach out to them but
how can I explain His silence to these

more about Shinmachi The last place
Father Ferreira lived and the place I

Father that if these are my last
words to you I ask forgiveness for my
weakness and my doubt and I beg God
for the strength to stand against
whatever suffering befalls me if Inoue
finds me And I ask you to remember
Father Garupe and me in your Masses
and in your prayers With my life and
whole heart I praise God Remember us
in your holy sacrifices your obedient
son”

They have to tear their glance away from the crosses which
stand like giant driftwood in the drift of the sea

Kichijiro was right If we’d left they
might still be alive

RODRIGUES
We don’t know that And we can’t
doubt That will be our death

GARUPE
Are we giving up Is that what we’re
doing Are we running away

RODRIGUES
It’s more of a test than we thought

GARUPE
After people have died for us I feel
like a coward

RODRIGUES
No Our purpose is the same We can’t
fulfill it if we’re captured
God will give us strength

Garupe REACHES inside his clothes and removes his rosary He
offers it to Rodrigues

Thank you brother But I have this

Rodrigues shows him the carved cross that Mokichi gave him

RODRIGUES

Rodrigues sounds as if he’s trying to convince himself of this
as well as give Garupe strength Garupe HOLDS HIS ARMS OUT to

OLD SAMURAI
That it all depends on you whether
they are set free Your Kirishitan God
is sensible at least in some things
Let him tell you to deny your faith

And if I refuse you’1l kill me “The
blood of martyrs is the seed of the
church” Like the priests in Omura and
Nagasaki

The Old Samurai looks at him sharply

OLD SAMURAI
Been thinking about this have you
Killing the peasants makes it worse
If they can die for their Deusu they
think it only makes them stronger

aware of his responsibility to be strong for them

SAMURAI 1
Father Rodrigues From Portugal yes
I am sorry Padre for my speaking My

Lordship the Governor of Chikugo is
anxious about your comfortcomfort

INTERPRETER
Perhaps “discomfort”

Discomfort yes About why you are

here And
He looks to the Interpreter who nods

SAMURAI 1 (contd)

Unsatisfied with the way he’s expressing himself he looks to

JAPANESE The Interpreter translates swiftly

1 speaks)
“Your trip was long There

of your determination touches
us greatly We know you have
also suffered greatly We do
not wish to add to your
suffering”

These words pierce Rodrigues’ heart They are gently spoken
but he senses the threat that lurks beneath them

SAMURAI 1

And the thought that we might
do so is painful for us too

RODRIGUES
Thank you

SAMURAI 1

Father the doctrine you

bring with you may be true in

Samurai 1 has to restrain his anger over this response Only
the OLD SAMURAI seems to understand what Rodrigues means and
even sympathize with it The priest is encouraged by the Old
Samurai’s response He GLANCES BRIEFLY over at the prisoners
watching from their cell window and continues boldly

RODRIGUES (contd)
You have no reply Why should you
Youre never going to change my
mind and I’m not going to change
yours If you really want to test

OFFICIALS settle themselves on them They stare indifferently
at FOUR CHRISTIAN PRISONERS on the ground in front of them

Rodrigues WATCHES from his cell window The whole scene is
played out from his POV through the bars on the window

Sounds of CICADAS and the SWISH of a fan or RUSTLE of a fine
robe worn by an official punctuate the weary routine of the
day OFFICIAL 1 almost sounds bored when he speaks up

OFFICIAL 1

This is just a formality really Just
one step that’s all We’re not asking
you to do it sincerely It’s only for
appearances Just putting your foot on
the thing won’t betray your faith
whatever it is Truthfully I’m not
interested The sooner you get it over

with the sooner we can all get out of
the sun

Rodrigues can tell the Official is trying to disarm the
prisoners and he can’t be sure how they will react

OFFICIAL 1 (contd)
Put your foot on it and nobody will
care what you believe Just rest
itbrush itlightly if you
likehowever you like it’s not
importantand you’ll be free
Immediately

Guards come forward carrying the fumie The Christians stare at
the face of Christ on the fumie Rodrigues SEES IT TOO and in
his cell mutters a prayer

RODRIGUES
Lord give them strength Lord give me
strength

The Official begins the formal ceremony by calling out for Juan
by his Japanese name

OFFICIAL 1
Chokichi

The Guards urge Monica’s one-eyed husband forward when he does
not respond He stands with his head bowed

OFFICIAL 1
Goahead Stamp on it
(Juan does not move)
It’s only a picture Crush it Do it

Juan can not will not obey One of the Guards SWATS HIM
impassively with a club pulls his head back by the hair
Looking straight at Official 1 Juan SHAKES HIS HEAD again

In a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS Juan’s FACE is replaced by the FACE
OF MONICAand then by the face of each of the other prisoners
in the yardEACH SHAKING THEIR HEADS in refusal

Official 1 SIGHS almost inaudibly then RISES The others
FOLLOW HIM into a hut at the far side of the yard The tension
has dissipated The Prisoners relax a little

Suddenly the VOICE of Official 1 CALLS across the yard

OFFICIAL 1
Take them all back But that one
(points to Juan)

--he stays

The Guards take three of the four prisoners to the hut Only
Juan remains behind continuing a conversation with the Guard

GUARD (0S)

Itseemsa pity to throw it away so
lightly

JUAN (0S)

Well it’s not lightly But it does
seem a pity

It sounds as if they’re talking about nothing more serious than
a corn husk Relieved Rodrigues draws away from the window and
rests his head against the cell wall

RODRIGUES (V0O)
Thank you Lord for hearing my
prayer

FLIES BUZZ around his face He SHOOS them away with his hand
then HEARS the SOUND of someone RUNNING ACROSS the prison yard
Then a kind of STEELY WHOOSHING SOUND

and then ANOTHER SOUND A dull CLAP OF IMPACT Curious
Rodrigues RETURNS to the window in time to see Juan’s severed
head coming ROLLING past him in the dust

Rodrigues RECOILS Official 1 and the Guard watch as Juan’s
headless body drops to the ground There are SCREAMS from the
hut as the Guard DRAGS Juan’s headless body to the RECENTLY DUG
HOLES in the yard and DUMPS it in Rodrigues SHUDDERS at the
sight

Official 1 stands in the doorway of the hut speaking loudly
now for all to hear

OFFICIAL 1
You’ve seen an example of what can
happen Now here is a perfect example

of how to avoid that fate Bring him
out here

Guards HAUL Kichijiro to the fumie

OFFICIAL 1
Goahead Just put your foot there
See how easy it is for him I admit

he’shad practice But look how simple
the movement is

Kichijiro dressed only in a loincloth puts his foot on the
face of Christ

OFFICIAL 1 (contd)

It’s not even as hard as bowing Is
it Is it

Kichijiro NODS his head

OFFICIAL 1

Or running Now go Get out of here
You see

He addresses the Prisoners now as Kichijiro DASHES for the
prison gatethrough the long RIBBON OF BLOOD on the ground
from Juan’s body

OFFICIAL 1
He lived up to his obligation We

stand by ours

Kichijiro vanishes into the busy street outside

The Officials leave the hut Guards take the prisoners back to
their cell The ordinary quiet of the yard is restored
Rodrigues stares into the bright stillness as if searching for
something

RODRIGUES
“Eternal Lord of all things I make my
offering with Your favor and help For
Your greater service and praise I
wish and desire to imitate you in
bearing all injuries and offenses”

The words turn to dust in his mouth His LIPS move but no sound
comes out

what this is

dust of the prison yard Then back to

Praying for But when I pray now I

is HOT to the touch Rodrigues places it on the ground He is
distracted uneasy Unsettled by the violence he’s witnessed

INOUE
I’m sorry I’ve neglected you for some
days now Padre but I had business in
Hirado I hope you’1l get to go there
yourself sometime

RODRIGUES
It must be very beautiful

INOUE
Well maybe more interesting than
beautiful There is an interesting
story about the daimyo who ruled
there You could say life had
overwhelmed him with generosity He
had four concubines Four They were
all beautiful but theyI’m sorry
maybe this is not a story for a
celibate priest

RODRIGUES
Please go on

INOUE

In any case they were beautiful but
they were all jealous and they fought
and fought without end So the daimyo
of Hirado drove them away from his
castle and peace came into his life
again

(beat)
Do you think this story has a lesson

RODRIGUES
Yes That this was a wise man as well
as a great one

INOUE
I’m glad you see it that way because
it means you see as I do The daimyo
is like Japan And these women are
Spain Portugal Holland England
each whispering bad bad lies about
the other into his ear Each trying to
gain the advantage against the other
and destroy the house in the process
If you think this man is wise then
you must understand why we must outlaw
the Kirishitan
RODRIGUES
Our church teaches monogamy What if
Japan were to choose one lawful wife
from the four

INOUE
You mean Portugal

RODRIGUES
I mean the holy church

INOUE
(laughs lightly)
Dont you think it would be better for
the man to forget about foreign women
and choose one of his own

RODRIGUES
Nationality is not so important ina
marriage What matters is love and
fidelity

INOUE
Love Padre there are men who are
plagued by the persistent love of an
ugly woman

RODRIGUES
That’s what you think missionary work
is

INOUE
Well from my point of viewour
point of viewyes What is the word
for a woman who cannot bear children

INTERPRETER
Barren

INOUE
A barren woman cannot be a true wife

RODRIGUES
If the Gospel has lost its way here
it’s not the fault of the church It’s
the fault of those who tear the
faithful from their faith like a
husband from a wife

INOUE
(Quietly)
You mean me

Rodrigues lets the question hang Inoue doesn’t seem angry

INOUE
Padre you missionaries do not seem to
know Japan

RODRIGUES
And you honorable Inquisitor do not
seem to know Christianity

Silence They have checkmated one another For the moment

INOUE

Padre there are thosethere are
manywho think of your religion as a
curse I do not I see it in another
way But still dangerous

(he rises)
Id like you to think about the
persistent love of an ugly woman And
about how a barren woman should never
be a wife

Inoue leaves the Interpreter BOWING as he passes

There is the sound of MOSQUITOS SWARMING just outside the door
Somewhere nearby a HORSE NEIGHS The Interpreter looks at
Rodrigues with a mixture of disbelief--that someone should have
spoken to Inoue in such a way--and pity--at the prospect of the
results of such talk

him you apostatized

The Interpreter observes Rodrigues’ shock with satisfaction

INTERPRETER
Nowdo you know what they use those
mats for

Guards WRAP the straw mats around the bodies of the three
prisonersbut NOT GARUPE One of the officials is talking
seriously to him

INTERPRETER
What could he be saying Maybe
this” If you are a priest with true
Christian charity you must pity them
You will not let them die because you
want your heaven”

Rodrigues is torn between desperation and fury as the
Interpreter continues

INTERPRETER (contd)
The Inquisitor promises that if Father
Garupe apostatizes the three will be
free They did deny the faith in his
office the other day anyway They
found it was not so difficult to take
a small step onto the fumie

RODRIGUES
If they did it then why are you still
doing this They did what you wanted
and

INTERPRETER

Oh we do not want them Three
Remember there are still hundreds of
Christian peasants on the islands off
the coast We want the Padre to deny
and be an example to them that is
all Then all this will be over

won’t be in Latin I wonder what he
will say Oh look

straw mats and are being PRODDED WITH LANCES to board a boat
that waits in the shallow water

INTERPRETER
Since you say mercy is the most
important thing in Christianity I
hope Father Garupe agrees

Garupe RUNS to the waters edge and SHOUTS something An
official in the boat shouts back to him

One of the guards on the boat STICKS a prisoner with his lance
sending him into the water The sea SOAKS the straw quickly
The man is PULLED DOWN under the waves drowned

GARUPE
“Lord have mercy Christ have
mercy”

And Garupe PLUNGES into the surf toward the boat

Guards PUSH another prisoner off the boat The prisoner SINKS
like a stone Garupe SWIMS like a man possessed of holy fury

The guards PROD Monica over the side She hits the water and
Garupe GRABS HER He starts to splutter a prayer but the
weight of the straw DRAGS them both down He will not let go

sweat His blazing blue eyes showing signs of pain and terrible
struggle

What little is visible of his body seems rigid and not just
with fear It seems to be in conflict with gravity itself At
war outside itself as well as within

And this is why

The ANGLE of the scene seems to PIVOT Ferreira’s world seems
literally to turn UPSIDE DOWN But the world is not out of
balance It is Ferreira himself

He is bound and SUSPENDED UPSIDE DOWN over a pit just visible
in GLIMMERS of light at the edges of this foul place

A TEAR RUNS from his eyedown his CHEEKwhere it JOINS a
thin TRICKLE OF BLOOD from the side of his head

A OS VOICE belonging to the INQUISITOR INOUE speaks softly
WE DO NOT SEE HIS FACE

INOUE
I am only asking you to take the path
of mercy Abandon yourself Do a
single simple thing

Ferreira’s head moves slightly Perhaps a nod of assent

solicitously

FERREIRA

INTERPRETER

writing About astronomy

FERREIRA
At Inoue Sama’s order There is great
knowledge here but in medicine and
astronomy much remains to be taught
I’m happy to help I’d like to show
you the lenses and telescope the
physician Albrecht just brought us
They’re very beautiful

Rodrigues stares at him incredulously
FERREIRA (contd)

It’s fulfilling to finally be of use
in this country

Rodrigues notices that Ferreira is SPEAKING so that the
Interpreter and the Old Priest CAN HEAR

RODRIGUES
Then you are happy Father

FERREIRA
I said so

The Old Priest looks IRRITABLE AND IMPATIENT at the course of
this conversation The Interpreter intervenes

INTERPRETER

Mention the other book you’re writing

Rodrigues notices that Ferreira HESITATES

INTERPRETER (contd)
It is called Kengiroku It shows the
errors of Christianity and refutes the
teachings of Deus Do you understand

Rodrigues searches Ferreira’s face for some sense of
shameeven embarrassment Ferreira lowers his eyes

Tell him
FERREIRA
(quietly)

It means Deceit Disclosed Or
Unmasked if you prefer a more florid
reading His Lordship the Inquisitor
has read the manuscript He praises
it He says it is well done

Rodrigues is stunned He SHAKES HIS HEAD in denial

INTERPRETER

It’s the truth
RODRIGUES

You use the truth like poison
INTERPRETER

What a funny thing for a priest to

say

Rodrigues LOOKS AGAIN at Ferreira who CAN’T MEET HIS EYES
RODRIGUES
It’s cruel worse than any torture
To twist a man’s soul this way

Ferreira TURNS HIS FACE AWAY from Rodriguesbut Rodrigues
thinks he glimpsed the trace of a tear in Ferreira’s eye
Perhaps this man he revered above all others has not changed so
thoroughly after all The Old Priest continues to look on
everyone like a stone Buddha

INTERPRETER
I think you must be speaking of
yourself Padre Not of Sawano Chuan

RODRIGUES
Who

INTERPRETER

Him He is Ferreira only to you He is
Sawano Chuan now A man who has found
peace Let him guide you along his
path The path of mercy That means
only that you abandon self No one
should interfere with another man’s
spirit To help others is the way of
the Buddha and your way too The two
religions are the same in this It’s
not necessary to win anyone over to
one side or another when there is so
much to share

(to Ferreira)
Go on

FERREIRA
I’ve been told to get you to abandon
the faith

He turns his head so Rodrigues can SEE a scar behind his ear

FERREIRA
This is from the pit You are tied so
you can’t move then hung upside down
and the incision is made You feel the
blood running down your cheek drop by
drop So it doesn’t run to your head
and you won’t die too soon

INTERPRETER
It was Inoue Sama’s idea It’s
practiced from Nagasaki all the way to
Edo You’re the last priest left here
now Padre I’m sure Inoue Sama would
be pleased to put an end to the pit
(MORE )
INTERPRETER (contd)
He is only a practical man Padre he
is not a cruel one

Ferreira leans in He still speaks quietly but his tone is
becoming increasingly emphatic

FERREIRA
I have been in this temple for a year
I have labored in this country for
fifteen years I know it better than
you Our religion does not take root
in this country

RODRIGUES
Because the roots have been torn up

FERREIRA
No

Ferreira’s tone has changed He speaks now with resolution
almost with vehemence There is no trace of the tear Rodrigues
thought he saw only moments before The light has returned to
his eyes

FERREIRA (contd)
Because this country is a swamp
Nothing grows here Plant a sapling
here and the roots rot

RODRIGUES
There was a time when Christianity
grew And flourished

FERREIRA
When

RODRIGUES
In your time Father Before you
became like

FERREIRA
Like who Like them Rodrigues please
listen The Japanese only believe in
their distortion of our gospel So
they did not believe at all They
never believed

RODRIGUES

How can you say this From the time of
Saint Francis Xavier through your own
time there were hundreds of thousands
of converts here

FERREIRA
Converts Francis Xavier came here to
teach the Japanese about the son of
God But first he had to ask how to
refer to God “Dainichi” he was told
And shall I show you their Dainichi

He POINTS to the skyto the setting sun

FERREIRA

(softly)
Beholdthere is the sun of God
Gods only begotten sun In the
scriptures Jesus rose on the third
day In Japan the sun of God rises
daily The Japanese cannot think of an
existence beyond the realm of nature
For them nothing transcends the
human They can’t conceive of our idea
of the Christian God

RODRIGUES
Youre wrong They worship God Our
Lord They praise the name of Deus

FERREIRA
That’s just another word for a god
they never knew

RODRIGUES
I saw men die for Deus They were on
fire with their faith

FERREIRA
Faith in the wrong god Their god not
ours And where does our churchyour
churchconsign believers in the
wrong God Your martyrs may have been
on fire Father but it was not with
faith

RODRIGUES
No I saw them die Those people did
not die for nothing

FERREIRA
Indeed not They’re dying for you

RODRIGUES
And how many did you save when you
crushed the image of Our Lord How
many beside yourself
FERREIRA
I don’t know Certainly not as many as
you may help

In the background there is the SOUND of bells and the priests
chanting sutras

RODRIGUES
Youre only trying to justify your own
weakness God have mercy on you

FERREIRA

Which god Which one We say
Mountains and rivers

(stops )
Im sorry You havent learned the
language thoroughly have you Theres
a saying here Mountains and rivers
can be moved But man’s nature cannot
be moved It’s very wise like so
much here We find our original nature
in Japan Rodrigues Perhaps its
whats meant by finding God

RODRIGUES
You are a disgrace Father I can’t
even call you that any more

FERREIRA
Good I have a Japanese name now And
wife And children I inherited them
all from an executed man

He gets up and WALKS INTO THE LENGTHENING SHADOWS of early
evening The Old Priest follows him Rodrigues watches him go
with a growing sense of helplessness If Ferreira gave up his
faith what hope can there be for him

be reading his mind

even more although they are strange hard to identify
sometimes they sound like groans other times like snores and
still at other times like animal sounds

piercing his soul

FERREIRA (contd)
Have you found the words on the wall
“Laudate Eum “Praise him” I cut
them there with a stone When I was in
this cell like you Do you think you
are the only one who doubted The only
one who called on God’s help and love
and got only silence in return

RODRIGUES
Be quiet You have no right to speak
to me

FERREIRA
I do because you are just like me You
see Jesus in Gethsemane and believe
your trial is the same as His Those
five in the pit are suffering too
just like Jesus but they don’t have
your pride They would never compare
themselves to Jesus Do you have the
right to make them suffer I heard the
cries of suffering in this same cell
And I acted

light

get what in return Only more

end Not God

a gaping pit of offal and filth Blood drips slowly from behind
their ears They moan in pain and desperation

The Interpreter and Ferreira stand on either side of the
stunned Rodrigues He has never been so close to their
suffering and the sight of it is like a mortal wound

FERREIRA
You can spare them They call out for
help just as you call to God He is
silent But you do not have to be

Apostatize Korobu Korobe

over They are here for you

apostatize they cannot be saved

receive their reward in heaven

Don’t make a mockery of those
beautiful words You’re only trying to
hide your fear Do you really believe
what you said

RODRIGUES
I believe

FERREIRA
You believe in yourself You set
yourself above them It’s your
salvation that obsesses you not
theirs You dread to be the dregs of

of love A priest should act in
imitation of Christ If Christ were
here

He quiets for a moment calming himself The MOANS from the pit
continue Ferreira resumes in a strong rational voice

acted Apostatized For their sake
Christ would certainly have done at
least that to help men

places on the ground before Rodrigues

will never do anything more important
than this

members of the house look on in mute terror

DIETER ALBRECHT (VO)
“In the year sixteen hundred and sixty-
seven a religious image was
discovered inside an amulet belonging
to a servant called Kichijiro”

CLOSE ON the amulet as a guard opens it Inside is a picture
of Saint Paul and on its reverse side the image of Saint
Francis Xavier and an angel

DIETER ALBRECHT
“The servant said he had won it
gambling had never looked inside and
could never have gotten the amulet
from Okada Sanemon since he was
always under guard The servant
Kichijiro was never seen again”

Rodrigues lips move silently No one but Kichijiro notices

DIETER ALBRECHT (VO)
“After that Okada Sanemon himself
was carefully watched But I must
relate to you Fathers that he never
acknowledged the Christian God Not by
word or symbol He never spoke of Him
and never prayed Not even when he
died”
