INT BEDROOM (DUSK)

Rosemary gets out of bed slides her feet into slip
pers the puts on her housecoat Going quietly out
of the bedroom she walks to the linen closet and
opens it The shelves look neat and orderly piled
with bath towels hand toweis and winter blankets

Rosemary takes everything out of the closet except
what is on the fixed top shelf She puts towels and
linens on the floor then lifts out the four ginghame
covered shelves The back of the closet below the
top shelf is a single large white-painted panel framed
with narrcw white molding Standing close and leaning
aside for better light Rosemary san see that where
the panei and the molding meet the paint is broken

in a continuous line She presses at one side of the
panel and then at the others presses harder and it
swings inward on seraping hinges Within is darlkmess3
second closet with a wire hanger glinting on the
floor and one bright spot of light a keyhole
Pushing the panel all the way cpen Rosemary steps
into the second cioset and ducks down

Through the keyhole Rosemary sees at a distance a
small curio cabinet that stands at a job in the halle
way of Mr and Mrs Castevets apartment RKosemary
tries the door It opens She sleses it and backs
out through her own closet and goes to the kitchen
From her knifesrack Rosemary takes the longest
sharpest carving knife As she is leaving the kite
chen we hear a key working in the lock of the front
door Rosemary rushes into the nursery brushing
against the new bassinet and presses herself against
the wall

‘Guy enters and goes into the kttohen opens ‘the fridge

and takes out ice cubes

Rosemary sees that the bassinet is swinging She
stops it with the point of the long knife

Guy comes out of the kitchen with Hutchs ise bucket
in his hand He opens the entrance docr and goes out

Rosemary listens for a moment then moves out to the
front door and chains it Holding the knife point
down at her side she goes down the hallway to the
linen closet door She opens it goes through again
into the second sloset (quick glance at the under-
neath of the fixed top shelf like in the dream)

Ahead are the foyer the front door and the archway
on the right to the living room The voices are
louder

MR FOUNTAIN (0S)
Not if hes still waiting for a

There is laughter and then hushing

MRS CASTEVET (05S)
Oh hell now Hayato youre just

is what we say over here

Rosemary is at the archway now She can see the
coven is at the other end laughing talking softly
Iee cubes clink She betters her grip on the’ knife
and moves a step forward She stops staring

Across the room in the one large window bay stands
a black bassinet skirted with black taffeta hooded
and flounced with black organza A silvér ornament
turns on a black ribbon pinned to its black hood
The stiff organza trembles The silver ornament
quivers and we can see that it is a crucifix hanging
upside down with the black ribbon wound and knotted
around Jesus ankles

Rosemary wipes her hands on her housecoat throws
pack her hair finds a fresh grip on the knifes
thick handle and steps out where they can see-her
Insanely they dont They go right on talking
listening sipping pleasantly partying Mr and
Mrs Castevet Guy Mr Fountain the Weeses Laura-
Louise and a studious-looking young Japanese with
eye-glasses All gathered under an over-the-mantel —

Rosemary watched them until she is by the bassinet -
which is angled in their direction With her free
hand she catches the blackcovered handle and swings
the bassinet slowly gently around to face her
Taffeta rustles the black wheels squeal She looks
in Smiling gently she slowly reaches her left arm
to take the baby The smile fades on her face and
ehanges into an expression of horror She backs
slowly away and freezes with her eyes wide open

brings the box to the bassinet She holds it up for
the baby to see shakes it and puts it on the

window seat There are other boxes similarly wrapped
and a few that are wrapped in black with black ribbon
Mr Castevet draws Argyron Stavropoulos forward

proprietary smile They close around it and look

into it silently Argyron Stavropoulos lowers himself
to his knees

into her hand and closes her fingers around it For
a few moments they rock the bassinet between them
thén Mr Castevet lets go and Rosemary rocks it alone
nice and slowly Mr Castevet withdraws silently to
where everybody now stands in a semi-circle watching
Dr Sapirstein comes into the room and looks at the
scene in surprise Mrs Castevet puts her finger to
her lips The Japanese steps forward and crouching
down to find an angle clicks his camera Very
softly Rosemary 1s humming From behind the window
we can hear the distant noise of thestreet and cars
hooting The sun-has already set ‘behind the buildings
and the pleasant evening light covers the city
