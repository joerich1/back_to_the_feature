JOHN MERINO
You’re coming down heavy on McBride

WARREN JUSTICE

These prisons John are maximus security
warehouses You don’t need so many guards
inside because nobody leaves his cell
You don’t even need so many guards out-
side because you’1l have what they call
“death fences Touch the fence and you
die That’s what McBride calls reforn
Reform is a code word For lock ‘em up
and throw away the key

JOHN MERINO locks at Tally then at Warren He shrugs

things they didn’t want to hear
