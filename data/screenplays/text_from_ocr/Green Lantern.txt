We begin

IN GREEN Vibrant verdant The longest fastest continuous
pullback ever begins A steady VOICE accompanies us

A MALE VOICE
We are not alone in the universe

Still pulling back to reveal an emerald LANTERN sky-
scraper tall and breathtaking THE CENTRAL BATTERY Then
the breathtaking liquid spires and towers of OA whip past

A MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
For years now we’ve known of a group of
extraterrestrials who patrol our universe
and keep it safe

Break orbit to reveal HUNDREDS OF GREEN LANTERNS Aliens
in a universe’s worth of variety each wielding POWER RINGS

A MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
We don’t know where they come from Or
where they get their power But we know
this much they’re good

They spar mastering ASSORTED WEAPONS of GREEN LIGHT Fluid-

Beautiful A sci-fi martial art

A MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
And they protect us Just as they
protect all life in the universe

And we’re off Suddenly flying through space Hyper-speed
Zipping past planets slaloming around suns and moons

A MALE VOICE (CONTD)
Impossible to imagine No more
impossible than when Columbus suggested
the Earth was round or when Copernicus
posited that it orbited the Sun

Then a familiar planet Neptune Then Uranus Saturn
Jupiter All raging past us until we arrive at

A MALE VOICE (CONTD)
There are heroes out there

EARTH Tumbling down into the atmosphere before landing
EXT TIMES SQUARE - NEW YORK —- DAY

It’s FULL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE stand in SHOCK and SILENCE
staring up at the trademark GIANT ASTROVISION TV SCREEN

A MALE VOICE
And now one of our own has joined them
Taking up arms against the forces of
evil Here and everywhere

ON THE SCREEN A weathered GREYING MAN (60’s) whom we’11
come to know as PIPE He’s at the end of a press conference
three seconds from changing the world

MALE VOICE PIPE (ON SCREEN)
One of us Now one of them
(then)
A Green Lantern

SMASH TO BLACK
A LEGEND APPEARS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
HAL (VO)
Jim says there’s gonna be thousands of
people here today

MARTIN JORDAN (VO)
It’s an air show Not the Superbowl

The blackness parts revealing DAYLIGHT Were in
INT AN AIRPLANE HANGAR - A PERFECT MORNING ON EARTH

Two massive doors split pushed by MARTIN JORDAN and his son
HAL We’re immediately jealous of their connection

HAL
Does it completely freak you out All
those people coming to watch you fly

MARTIN JORDAN
Naah It’s not me they’re coming to see
It’s this

The FLUORESCENTS FLICKER on revealing a fourth generation-
style JET the RAMJET Hal races toward it

HAL
Sweet When can I take her up

MARTIN JORDAN
When you’re big enough to get in the
cockpit without my help

HAL
Mr Ferris lets me use the simulator
I’m getting pretty killer

MARTIN JORDAN
Carol lets you use the sim If her pop
knew he’d kill you both
Martin lifts Hal up onto the wing

HAL
Does it bother you that Mom doesn’t come
watch you fly

MARTIN JORDAN
It’s not me flying planes she has a
problem with It’s me testing them

HAL
So why do you

MARTIN JORDAN
Someone’s gotta be first Hal

The concern in Hal’s look draws Martin closer to his son

MARTIN JORDAN (CONTD)
Someday if your brothers let you live
long enough you’re gonna be an adult
And youre gonna make a million choices
Like where to live What kinda car to
drive Who your friends are But every
now and then if you’re really lucky
something chooses you When that
happens there’s no fighting it Your
mother might not agree with what I do
but she understands that much

Martin watches the concept sink in with Hal Then

MARTIN JORDAN (CONTD)
So Wanna checkout the cockpit
(Hal leaps up)
Wait Youre gonna need this

Martin strips off his bomber jacket places it on Hal The
call sign “SABRE” on the chest As Hal gets in
HAL
You think Mom will understand if I’m

chosen to be a Samurai

MARTIN JORDAN
She’s handled worse

EXT FERRIS FIELD - A GORGEOUS DAY

WERE SOARING over open fields CARS lined up eight rows
deep LOCALS sit on hoods and roofs A BANNER shouts “THE
FERRIS ATR SPECTACULAR - A 5-YEAR TRADITION

A DEAFENING CHEER erupts as the RAMJET BUZZES the field

INT CONTROL TOWER - SAME TIME

Hal (still in the bomber jacket) turns from the glass --

HAL
That must’ve been Mach-Two

CAROL FERRIS a few years and orthodontist visits away
from growing into her looks steps beside him She does her
best to hide a blossoming crush

CAROL
Mach-Three When’re you gonna learn how
to read a sonic boom
(then notices)
Nice jacket Does it come any bigger

HAL
Nice braces Do they come any brighter

Hal crosses to a BOTTLE of chilled DOM

HAL (CONTD)
Mr Ferris can I crack her open

Amidst a half-DOZEN ADULTS stands an imposing CARL FERRIS
(40s) He dons a rare smile Into his headset

CARL FERRIS
Tower to Sabre Your son wants to know
if you’re done showing off and we can get
this party started

MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
Roger that Tower Tell my son I said
two fingers worth for him and that’s it

CARL FERRIS
(to Hal)
You heard him Hal Knock it out

Hal’s about to do that when BOOM And not the sonic kind
AN EXPLOSION Hal races to the window The RAMJET SPIRALS
through the air leaving a CORKSCREW of BLACK SMOKE

MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
Tower I got a flameout in the starboard
engine Over

CARL FERRIS
She can’t fly on one engine Eject

MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
Can’t do it Tower The jet’ll go
straight into the crowd

CARL FERRIS
Sabre get outta that plane Now

MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
I’m pushing her to the runway first

Carol turns to Hal but Hal is half-way out the room We i
FOLLOW HAL DOWN THE STAIRS bounding two at a time

CARL FERRIS (VO)
It’s too far away Martin

MARTIN JORDAN (VO) CARL FERRIS (VO) i
I can do it Sabre I said EJECT

MARTIN JORDAN (V0O) CARL FERRIS (V0O)
I’m clear Ejecting now -- Sabre I’m ordering you to

eject now

An EARTH SHATTERING CRASH as Hal flies out of the building
Carol is right after him watching Hal frantically search the
PLUME of BLACK SMOKE in the distance

HAL

Where is it Where’s his ‘chute
CAROL

Hal
HAL

Where’s his ‘chute

Carol looks at him heartbroken GO SLOW MO as Hal losing
it tries to run toward the crash site but an OLDER BOY
(JIM) grabs hold of him

We gaze down at the DEVASTATION Amongst the flames and
metal the SHATTERED COCKPIT tells us everything we need to
know We FOLLOW the rush of SMOKE into the blue sky HIGHER
and FASTER MUSIC BUILDS Then the pitch black of
EXT INTERSTELLAR SPACE
A LEGEND APPEARS SPACE SECTOR 2814
IT FADES THEN ANOTHER TODAY
A SHIP SHRIEKS BY -- a small otherworldly SPACECRAFT
INT ABIN SUR’S SPACECRAFT
A complex NAVIGATION DISPLAY Operating it is the craft’s
pilot ABIN SUR Noble features Magenta skin Abin’s
RING FLICKERS and a HOLOGRAM in GREEN LIGHT appears It’s a
prissy fin-headed fishman TOMAR-RE VIA RING
TOMAR-RE
You could have been there and back by now
if you’d gone by ring
ABIN SUR
Markot deserves the proper return home
It is not often a Lantern falls

In a corner a METALLIC COFFIN

TOMAR-RE
What will you tell them about how he was
lost

ABIN SUR

All that we know He was overpowered in
the service of protecting his sector

TOMAR-RE
And that three Lanterns were slaughtered
before him --

ABIN SUR
There’s no cause to spread fear

A BUMP makes his ship LURCH -- the nav system GOES OUT

TOMAR-RE
If you insist on traveling by ship Abin
at least learn to operate one

ABIN SUR
Weve been friends a long time Tomar-Re
Perhaps one day I’1l understand why

The hologram shuts off Abin’s RING PULSES He is instantly
enveloped in a BRILLIANT GREEN AURA

EXT SPACE - MINUTES LATER

Abin protected by that aura FLOATS OUTSIDE his ship He
takes a moment to appreciate the view a ballet of 63
MOONS rotating around SATURN Small universe

Abin surveys his ship’s hull He floats toward a BROKEN
DISH As he does a FLASH BEHIND HIM -- a GOLD BLUR Abin
doesnt see it But we do

Abin’s Ring creates TOOLS to fix the dish (the Ring just gets
cooler and cooler) The FLASH BEHIND HIM comes round again
This time Abin sees its GOLD LIGHT He turns to see --

A MASSIVE CREATURE blocking out the Sun The size of a WHALE
with tentacles of an OCTOPUS and a SHARK’S KILLER GRIN This
is LEGION And we fear it

ABIN SUR
(holy fuckshit)
Great Krona --

Abin FIRES A FULL FORCE RINGBLAST AT LEGION Everything his
ring has deployed in one massive magnificent pulse

But nothing happens His ring didn’t work on Legion -- which

fires forth A SERIES OF GOLD BLASTS Abin’s ring calls up a
GREEN SHIELD deflecting the incoming fire Barely

Legion’s tentacles LASH OUT grabbing Abin and curling him up
to the YELLOW FANGS of its DRIPPING MAW

Abin summons a huge GREEN HAND grabs a passing ASTEROID and
sends it RAMMING -- SMASH -- INTO LEGION Legion drops Abin
buying him enough time to climb back into --

INT ABIN SUR’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS

Abin slams down the controls so that the ship’s GUNS FIRE
SIMULTANEOUSLY AT LEGION ©

The force sends Legion flying back -- and propels Abin’s ship
ahead BURSTING THROUGH ONE OF SATURN’S RINGS Legion is
lost in the distance

Abin looks to a GAPING WOUND in his side A PURPLISH STAIN
colors his uniform Struggling for consciousness Abin’s
Ring generates a beam of light

ABIN SUR

This is Abin Sur chosen protector of
Sector 2814 I have seen what hunts
us Legion it lives The Ring holds
no effect no defense -- You must take
action Legion is real

(a raspy gasp then)
I have escaped but not with my life
I shall proceed to the nearest sentient
planet for selection

EXT SPACE - OUTSIDE THE SHIP
REVEAL what he’s aiming for Some 820 million miles away

EARTH Our comforting familiar blue home As Abin’s ship
straightens to find its course we DISSOLVE TO

ANOTHER SPACESHIP No it just looks like a spaceship It’s
actually the SABRE JET the latest brainchild of Carl Ferris

CAROL (V0O)
Pilots are obsolete

We’re watching the Sabre as it’s put through its paces on a
VIDEO playing on ALL FIVE FLATSCREEN DISPLAYS in

INT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - DESIGN SHOWROOM - DAY

Smart and modern Models of the SABRE in various design
stages CAROL FERRIS braces long gone and replaced with an
MBA mesmerizes A FEW SUITS and TWO GENERALS

CAROL
I know conventional wisdom says planes
can’t think like people And I know
conventional wisdom says U-CAVs arent
ready for mass deployment That the tech
isn’t there yet

(beat)

Conventional wisdom is for followers
Ferris Air is about to make all aerial
combat missions unmanned Today

The SUITS look intrigued -- except for one who speaks with
the confidence of a former astronaut current SENATOR

SENATOR
And what do you expect all those pilots
we spent thirteen billion taxpayer
dollars training to do

i

i

‘
i

CLOSE ON

familiar it should

CAROL
If our skies are safer and their lives
protected I expect them to thank me

SENATOR
Then you don’t know pilots Ms Ferris

CAROL
Enough to know pilots like you are few
and far between Senator Most aren’t
four-star NASA icons Most pilots are
far more human than that There are
pilots who are cocky Pilots who are
irresponsible

A WELL-WORN BOMBER JACKET on a floor

CAROL (VO) (CONTD)
And pilots who are both

If it looks

Its the one Hal’s father gave him

INT OCEAN VIEW APARTMENT - COAST CITY - THAT MOMENT

PAN to the bed and UP the INTERTWINED LEGS of JENNA a yoga-

toned hottie and HAL JORDAN

that much more mature

HAL
Now I remember why yoga’s my second
favorite thing in life

JENNA
Yeah What’s the first

HAL

Yoga instructors It’s a photo finish
with flying

JENNA
(they kiss then

15 years older and not all

)
» And what was that little maneuver

called again

HAL
A Split-S Also known as an Immelmann
Turn Dangerous stuff It should only

be performed by a certified professional

The sound of a CAR pulling in interrupts their good time

Then a DOORSLAM Jenna sits up sharply Not good

JENNA
Oh no -- he’s early

HAL
Whos early

Jenna starts throwing clothes at Hal a mile a minute --

JENNA
Okay so remember after we did those
shots how I said how weird it was that
Tibet was your favorite place in the
world too and I broke up with my
boyfriend because he wouldn’t ever go
with me and you were so my type --

HAL
Yeah I may have exaggerated my
enthusiasm for Far East travel --

JENNA
That’s okay I may have exaggerated how
much I broke up with my boyfriend

HAL
And he’s here
(she nods he is)
Now

Yep Hal takes a glance out the window and sees her
MOTHERFUCKING HUGE BOYFRIEND walking towards the house

HAL (CONTD)
You’re sure that’s just one guy

Hal puts his pants on both legs at once as --

CAROL (VO)
It comes down to fear

INT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - DESIGN SHOWROOM - RESUMING

CAROL
All pilots are susceptible It’s a human
instinct Train them for years spend
billions you can’t get rid of it And
it’s fear that causes mistakes

EXT OCEAN VIEW APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MOMENTS LATER
Hal is out the window pulling on his clothes when he
spots HIS BOMBER JACKET Still on the floor Inside
Jenna fends off her boyfriend’s suspicions
MOTHERFUCKING HUGE BOYFRIEND
I texted you all night babe Where were
you
JENNA
I taught a late Bikram class The steam
made my phone all sweaty
He’s about to believe the lie when he turns to find -- Hal
reaching in to retrieve his bomber jacket Busted
HAL
Forgot this Don’t let me interrupt you

And Hal TAKES OFF -- up the fire escape -- as --

CAROL (V0O)
End of the day pilots are only human

EXT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - HANGAR - RESUMING

Carol leads the SUITS into the ultra-modern hangar where an
even more ultra modern jet rests A SABRE PROTOTYPE

CAROL
Whereas the Sabres are more than human
Each has SARMTI and EOIR sensors which
feed into a sub-symbolic neural net
These aren’t drones They’re the chess
machine that can beat the grandmaster

SENATOR
Our pilots live for combat Ms Ferris
No machine can compete with the fire we
put in our boys

CAROL
In that case maybe you’d be willing to
suit up and fly against them in our
demonstration

The Senator decides to LAUGH it off CARL FERRIS himself
older and crankier sidles up to Carol Sotto

CARL FERRIS
Explain how pissing off the guy with the
government checkbook gets us closer to
congressional funding

CAROL
I can handle him Dad You worry about
getting a backup pilot Youre still
missing your third

CARL FERRIS
He’11 show

CAROL’
Really Because I’m running out of
shpiel and looking at an empty F-16

CARL FERRIS
I’ve been preparing for this day for
fifteen years I know what I’m doing

CAROL
There are better pilots out there than
Hal Jordan Who show up

CARL
We don’t need better pilots We need the
ones who’1l make the Sabre look good
Carol clocks her father’s savvy Checks her watch

CAROL
Three two one

As they exit the hangar doors to the tarmac on perfect
A SABRE BUZZES clean over all their heads

CAROL (CONTD)
Gentlemen the future of flying

EXT BEACH COMMUNITY - ROOFTOPS - RESUMING

Hal FLIES across the rooftops reminding himself

HAL
Next time down the fire escape

A glance backward JENNA’S BOYFRIEND is gaining And
homicidal Hal whips out his cellphone as he runs

HAL (CONTD)
(into phone)
Hey It’s me I need a favor I’m
running a little late

With that Hal LEAPS off the roof’s edge As he’s mid-flight

we MATCH CUT TO
A 1967 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE skidding to a dead stop

EXT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - PARKING LOT - A LITTLE LATER

Hal gets out as his best friend TOM KALMAKU (late 20s) RUNS
UP carrying a flight suit Tom’s part Eskimo all dedicated

cue

nerdling Hal snags the suit putting it on as they walk

HAL
They didn’t start yet did they

TOM
No ‘Cause they’re waiting For you

HAL
Nice how everything works out
EXT ON THE TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER

Tom and Hal round the corner toward the JETS Carol is
coming at them Tom suddenly shifts course away

HAL
Where are you going

TOM
To the tower She scares me

CAROL
You’re late

HAL
And your candy machine’s out of those
peanut butter crackers A guy skips
lunch because he makes certain
assumptions about snack availability

CAROL
Were making history with the Sabre today
-- not even you can ruin my mood

HAL
Nice name by the way Sabre I’m sure
your dad gave himself a good bonus pat on
the back for that one

CAROL
It’s in your father’s honor Hal

HAL
My father would’ve hated it It’s a
piece of metal with an X-Box for a
brain It’ll never replace a pilot

CAROL
It’s beaten most of them already

He climbs up and into his jet As he does

HAL
Hasn’t beaten me How about if I win
we go down to the riverbed and recreate a
little night I like to call Junior Prom

CAROL
It wasn’t a night more like three
minutes

HAL
Then make it dinner You me lobster
your company card

CAROL
Well see how hungry you are after you
get your ass kicked Fly safe

HAL
Never learned how

Hal watches her go A sight he’1ll never get over
INT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - CONTROL TOWER - MINUTES LATER

A 360 degree view of the sky ON TOM at the CONTROL STATION
headset on Carol takes her place beside him The Generals
and Carl arc around Into his headset

TOM
Gentlemen you are about to engage the
fearsome and mighty Sabre U-CAV I wrote
half the code on ‘em myself so I should
warn you

EXT FERRIS AIRCRAFT - TARMAC - SAME TIME

The THREE F-16s LINE UP ACROSS FROM THEM on the other side
of the runway the THREE SABRES line up opposite

TOM (OVER RADIO)
This is gonna suck hard for you

MUSIC RISES POUNDING LOUDER as the JET ENGINES flare
and THE SIX PLANES take off WE INTERCUT WITH

EXT THE CRISP BLUE SKY

A LIGHTING-FAST 3-ON-3 DOGFIGHT over the California
FOOTHILLS Hal breaks formation going after one of the
Sabres He’s more than a pilot he’s a natural A sharp
left and Hal’s got one CROSSHAIRED

HAL
Tower this is Highball Id like to
report a yawn fast approaching

Hal’s missile lock CHIMES but the Sabre DIVES in a
phenomenal physics-shattering move Dammit if the Sabre
isn’t pursuing Hal now

HAL (CONTD)
You didn’t mention they could teleport

CAROL
(to the Suits)
The Sabres utilize the same targeting
algorithms as your current U-CAVs but
the flying protocols are as close to
human-grade as you can get

Hal’s F-16 TEARS down towards the other two -- which are
struggling in their own dogfight with Sabres 2 and 3 A LASER
SPRAYS from Sabre 2 TARGET LOCKING right onto an F-16s
tail Sabre 2 births a MISSILE -- which EXPLODES out and --

HAL
Ion Break right

But the missile CONNECTS splattering the fuselage in YELLOW
PAINT Dead Hal FIRES a MISSILE at the Sabre But the
Sabre BANKS -- and SOMERSAULTS -- to come around laser
target and NAILS the third jet SPLAT

HAL (CONTD)
What are you feeding those things

TOM
F-16s

CAROL
For those keeping score it’s now three
against one

ALL THREE SABRES target Hal now Hal pulls every move he can
think of -- SKIMMING THE TREES -- HUGGING the GROUND -- but
nothing works They’re flies on shit

14

CAROL (CONTD)
The Sabres are programmed to perform
every flight maneuver within known
parameters

The Sabres stream closer TARGETING he’s a split-second
from toast when HAL SUDDENLY YANKS his throttle His F-16
CLIMBS MANIACALLY FAST The THREE SABRES fly hard after him

TOM
Highball what’re you doing

HAL
These things are programmed within known
parameters thought I’d try out the
other kind

Tom reads the screen so does Carol Uh oh

TOM
He’s taking them into --

CAROL
A coffin corner Can they follow

TOM
They don’t know not to We never
accounted for self-destructive behavior

One of the suits speaks up sending the concern --

A SUIT
What’s a coffin corner

SENATOR
The altitude where a plane’s stall speed
equals its Mach

CARL FERRIS
If a plane hits it it stalls out

Carol grabs Tom’s headset Pissed and a little scared
CAROL
Hal the F-16 youre flying is a nineteen
million dollar aircraft --

HAL
It’s insured right

CAROL
Youre not You won’t have enough oxygen
up there You’1l pass out
WARNING LIGHTS FLASH as the unimaginable G-FORCES overtake
Hal The SABRES are still right up his ass

HAL
Ill wake up

CAROL
Pull out Now dammit

Hal’s F-16 is a SPACE SHUTTLE barrelling the UPPER
ATMOSPHERE The Sabres start to SHUDDER -- but Hal has a
harder time breathing He RIPS off his MASK

TOM
I’m losing Sabres Alpha and Beta Make
that Alpha Beta and Gamma

The Sabres’ engines GO OUT Another STALLS As they all
become 100 million ROCKS and PLUMMET to the Earth

SUIT
What just happened

CARL FERRIS
The Sabres followed Hal into a stall but
because they’re unmanned they can’t
restart their own engines

SENATOR
Almost makes you wish you had a cocky
pilot flying them Ms Ferris

CAROL
(to Tom defeated)
Trigger a manual restart

The Sabres RESTART to return safely But Hal is STILL
CLIMBING He begins to lose consciousness

A QUICK SERIES of FLASH CUTS Young Hal watching his

father’s plane tumbling from the sky the BLAZE and HORROR
of the WRECKAGE itself

CLOSE ON HAL -- HE BLACKS OUT as his own engines FLICKER OUT

TOM
Hal just lost his engines

CAROL
Hal Wake up Hal

But Hal is out His plane begins to FREEFALL TO EARTH
SPINNING WILDLY - end over end with the SUN FLASHING in our
eyes as we TUMBLE WITH HIM --

CAROL (CONTD)
Dammit Hal wake up

Carol (and the rest of us) have almost lost all hope when
FOOM The F-16’s engines COME TO LIFE blossoming with
light The plane FIRES AHEAD PEALING RIGHT OVER THE GROUND
BACK INSIDE THE JET

Hal smiles rubs his eyes like he never had a doubt

HAL
Well that was easy
EXT AIRSTRIP - JUST AFTER
Carol beelines for Hal as he steps off his plane

CAROL
How stupid are you

HAL
Um “Amazing moves there Hal You sure
know your way around a Thatch Weave”

Hal spots Carl walking the Generals to their car He shouts

after them a young man’s fury

HAL (CONT’D)
If you’re gonna take jobs away from
pilots you better do it with something
that can pull out of a stall

CAROL
You almost got yourself killed
And for what To spite my father
(then)
After all the times I stood up for you
the one day I needed you to come through

HAL
I know why he wanted me here today He
thought I’d be an easy target Sorry if
I disappointed

She wishes she could fire him -- but she just can’t
too much history there too much everything
CAROL

Youre grounded Permanently You want
to see another jet come to the air show

Carol goes to leave Hal calls after her payback

HAL
So I’m thinking like eight tomorrow You
come by my place we have a drink first
I’m going casual but you should wear that
little blue cocktail dress --
(Carol turns)
The bet Remember

CAROL
(you’re so fucked)
If you’1l excuse me I have to go call
your mother

Back on Hal the first sign of fear in his eyes

Theres

EXT EARTH’S ORBIT - THAT MOMENT

Abin’s ship shoots into Earth’s atmosphere at destructive
speeds -- a dead weight SPIRALLING -- FLARING UP with the
immense heat so hot pieces of it MELT away --

EXT A PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

TWO KIDS play with their TOY SPACESHIPS -- SOMEHOW they don’t
notice THE REAL SPACESHIP STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY OVERHEAD

KID
Alien attack Ptchoo

EXT A DESERT —- DAY

Seconds before the ship hits the GREEN LIGHT surrounding it
focuses to the fore as it CRASHES

DRIVING DEEP INTO THE GROUND Dust flies then settles
Then all goes quiet No sign of life The wind picks up

A THIN SNAKE OF SMOKE rises set against the unkind sun
FOLLOW THE SMOKE DOWN TO A FRESH CRATER IN THE EARTH

CLOSE ON A CAPILLARY LINE of PURPLE BLOOD dripping between
rocks Follow the trickle to A MAGENTA-HUED HAND It’s
ABINS The wreckage crushing him He looks to his ring

ABIN SUR
(barely a whisper)
Someone honest someone brave

As if understanding the RING GLIMMERS then SPINS becoming
a SPHERE OF GREEN LIGHT Which RISES UP into the sky

EXT AROUND THE EARTH - THAT MOMENT

FOLLOW THE SPHERE as it FLIES AROUND THE PLANET at fantastic
speed A streak of light Seeking something or SOMEONE

It crosses the DESERT over the SUNSET STRIP and all the
CRUISING DRIVERS Picking up speed as it DOES A COMPLETE
CIRCUIT AROUND THE WORLD buzzing (UNSEEN) past THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE faces OLD and YOUNG PAST SOLDIERS and FARMERS
and BUSINESSMEN bypassing CONGRESS entirely

PAST A GLASSES-WEARING REPORTER at THE DAILY PLANET

OVER A COLLEGE FOOTBALL FIELD and a COACH with the name
“GARDNER” on his jersey (obscuring a hero we’ll meet in the
second film) the GREEN LIGHT CIRCLES him TWICE deciding --
then SUDDENLY SENSES SOMETHING ELSE As it BOLTS OFF
DISSOLVE TO A STREAK OF SPARKLERS SPINNING --

EXT JIM JORDANS HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

It’s a summer BIRTHDAY PARTY The Jordans are a large

gorgeous FAMILY You won’t be able to distinguish between
them at first that’s the point There’s a lot of them

JIM and JACK Hal’s All-American BROTHERS are
restocking the cooler They turn to see HAL approach

HAL
Sorry I’m late wasn’t the best day at
work

JACK

No kidding A coffin corner Hal
(off Hals look)
Yeah we heard Carol’s voice carries

HAL
Where’s Nathan

JIM
Wondering why his favorite uncle isn’t
here He thought you forgot Again

I remember everything

JIM
Like the way you remembered to pick me up
for my wedding --

HAL
I came back for you Listen You don’t
know if Mom knows too do you

Hal’s mother HELEN JORDAN (50s) heads over Her natural
beauty almost covers the tragedy behind her eyes Almost
The smile converts into a death glare

JACK
-- I’m gonna guess she does

Helen’s inches from Hal now Quiet stern

HELEN JORDAN
Risking your life to prove a point
(her anguish showing)
After what this family’s been through
Your father would be so disappointed

HAL
Yeah well he’s dead so

She SMACKS him Hal freezes knows he deserved it The rest
of the party notices Tense awkward silence

HELEN JORDAN
You only think about yourself How did I
raise such a selfish child

HAL
You didn’t I did this all on my own

NATHAN (0S)
Uncle Hal

Hal’s nephew NATHAN dives onto Hal Breaks the tension

HAL
Happy Birthday Flyboy

As Nathan laughs Hal looks back to his mother But she’s
already walking away

EXT BACKYARD - SOMEWHERE PRIVATE - MOMENTS LATER
They walk toward a SWING SET where Nathan sits Hal pushes

NATHAN
It’s okay if you didn’t get me a present

HAL
What do you know Maybe I did get you
something Look up there
(points to the stars)
See when I was in the Air Force --

NATHAN
Before you got thrown out

HAL
Stay with me telling a story here
When I was still in the Air Force I made
some friends in the Galactic
Exploration Division Top level
research secret space stuff I asked if
there were any good stars up for grabs
And you see that one right there No one
else claimed it so it’s all yours
You even get to name it

A moment of wonder Unfortunately Nathan’s a smart kid

NATHAN
You mean Hadar

HAL
It’s already got a name

A STREAK OF GREEN LIGHT whizzes past stopping suddenly It
HOVERS over HAL Dancing around him like a bee

NATHAN
A few Also Agena or Beta Centauri
‘cause it’s so close to Alpha Centauri
It’s the 11th brightest star in the sky

HAL
You know maybe you shouldn’t read so
much get a video game or something

The BALL OF LIGHT moves THROUGH HAL’S BODY shooting out the
other side and UP INTO THE SKY Hal reacts

NATHAN
Uncle Hal you okay

i

Hal looks down at his chest Unsure what just happened Did
I just see something He shakes it off

HAL
Sure Okay Flyboy you ready to loop
this sucker

Nathan YELLS excitedly as we FOLLOW THE LIGHT farther and
farther AWAY from THEM and up into the NIGHT SKY It HITS
the STRATOSPHERE and EXPLODES INTO

FOUR GLOWING GREEN SCIMITARS wielded simultaneously and
expertly We’re in the middie of a nasty fight in

An intense Sinestro storms down the hall As he does he
passes an ARRAY of ALIEN LIFE All wearing versions of the
same uniform He heads toward two ENORMOUS DOORS FIRING a
wild RING-BLAST that sends the great doors FLYING OPEN --
INT THE CITADEL - CONTINUOUS

Like the Roman Senate set against the starry heavens Above
and looking down are --

THE GUARDIANS

BLUE SKIN and ENLARGED HEADS TWO ROWS of them extending
into the distance Their red and white robes billow to the
ground giving them impossible stature

The Guardians communicate telepathically projecting their
thoughts as one directly into Sinestro’s mind

SINESTRO
Abin Sur is dead

GUARDIAN (V0O)
We know --

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
- The Guardians mourn with you

But there is no feeling to back the words

SINESTRO
When the first Lantern fell I came to
this council and was told to do nothing
Will you ask that same mindless devotion
of me now Something is out there --
strong enough to kill three Lanterns now
four We must fight back We must arm
ourselves

GUARDIAN (VO)
You already wield the greatest weapon the
universe has ever known

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
What greater arms would you carry

SINESTRO
You know better than I that there is a
light more powerful than this

Sinestro calls another GREEN BLAST EXPLODING into the ground
below shattering the ancient marble Gross insubordination

GUARDIAN (VO)
There was a time not so long ago that you
stood before us and begged to be called
Ringbearer --

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (V0O)
-- Begged for the right to defend your
sector with the very weapon you now deem
lacking

SINESTRO
My friend dies and that’s your answer to
remind me of my obligations
GUARDIAN (VO)
If you so wish to honor Abin Sur train
his replacement He comes soon
Off Sinestro sensing his defeat and hating it
EXT JIM JORDAN’S HOUSE - BACK ON EARTH - NIGHT

Jim walks Hal out Hal’s got extra birthday cake for later

JIM
Where you headed Please say it’s to see
some girl you barely know -- please say
she’s like 23 and vaguely ethnic I love
my wife but I’ve been married 10 years
and I live through you

HAL
Sorry been a long day I just wanna be
alone with my cake Will you

JIM
I’1l talk to Mom But do anything that
stupid again and you wont have to worry
about her killing you There’ll be a
line Got it

A hug goodnight Jim goes inside Hal slides into the i
Mustang starts it only the damn thing WON’T turn over
He tries again -- then it dies again No dice

HAL
Come on not now You start and I go
home and today can be over --

He turns the key again -- and for a second Hal notices in the
rearview mirror a GLIMMER OF THAT SAME GREEN LIGHT he thought i
he saw before but it’s gone just as the car STARTS

Just then the RADIO DIAL BEGINS TO GLOW -- and guess what
color That’s weird Hal SMACKS the dash a couple of
times But the GLOW SPREADS slowly ENVELOPING THE CAR
Hal pulls his hands off the steering wheel

HAL (CONTD)
-the hell is that Coolant

In a moment the car is surrounded by a HONEYCOMB OF EMERALD
LIGHT But before he can properly lose his shit -- the CAR
SUDDENLY JOLTS Hal falls to the floor He pulls himself up
just in time to see --

THE CAR LIFT UP OFF THE GROUND AND GODDAMMIT IF IT DOESNT
FLY Taking out a POWER LINE as it RISES INTO THE NIGHT SKY

HAL (CONTD)
Whoawhoawhoa --

Very reasonably Hal freaks the fuck out --

HAL (CONTD)
Car flying Not cool

He sees the ground diminishing as the car ROCKETS UP He
tries steering realizes that’s stupid so he buckles up

Hal leans over the window and realizes he’s 2000 FEET UP
Through the GREEN SHELL surrounding the Mustang he can see a
CESENA FLYING not a hundred feet off

REVERSE ANGLE The CESNA PILOT looks in Hal’s direction --
SEEING NOTHING The car is CLOAKED

Hals body is suddenly bathed in the most beautiful GREEN
LIGHT he’s ever seen coming from the AC vents It calms him
as WE HEAR A RESONANT VOICE coming through the RADIO

ABIN SURS VOICE
Listen well For you have been chosen

A FOCUSED BEAM OF LIGHT from the AC vent projects INTO HAL’S
EYES A SHOTGUN BLAST of IMAGES and INFORMATION unfolds

ABIN SURS VOICE (CONT’D)
Chosen by the Guardians of the
Universe

A SPIRAL into the Guardians’ CITADEL The blue-skinned robed
demigods float in a ring encircling the COSMOS

ABIN SURS VOICE (CONT’D)
-as the bravest of your world

IMAGES of wildly diverse ALIEN SPECIES assault Hal’s senses

ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Chosen to join the bravest of all
worlds The Green Lantern Corps

The CORPS Standing like an army on the foothills of TRINITY
CANYON on OA They raise their POWER RINGS in unison a
salute emitting a blinding GREEN GLOW

ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONTD)
Charged with maintaining peace

QUICK CUTS All manner of GREEN LANTERNS performing acts of
selfless heroism Rescuing a crippled spaceship

ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Across all 3600 sectors of the universe

MORE CUTS Evacuating a planet as a supernova blooms
Battling monsters

ABIN SURS VOICE (CONTD)
Without the Corps there would be only
fear and chaos

PUSH IN ON the Lanterns their grace winning the day

ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONTD)
To serve is the highest honor

And on “honor” the EMERALD LIGHT DISAPPEARS so that Hal is
looking out the windshield at the DESERT FIFTY FEET BELOW --
and the car PLUMMETS TOWARD IT

POOOOM His car CRASHES into the SAND As the dust settles
we catch a familiar GREEN STREAK moving away to

t
i

CLOSE UP Of the RING power depleted falling into a
MAGENTA HAND The hand closes around it

BACK ON THE TOTALLED MUSTANG The door POPS open A shaky
and freaked out Hal FALLS OUT He looks back to the car

HAL
That was so wrong

He backs away from the car like it was possessed backing
towards the jutting TAIL END of --

ABIN’S SHIP

BONK He whacks his head on the surface -- and turns to see
The strange craft illuminated by the Mustang’s highbeams

Hal stops SOMETHING IS STIRRING inside the wreck -- Hal
goes straight in WRENCHES a metal plate off the pilot

HAL (CONTD)
Hang on Ill get you outta there

One last effort and CLANG -- he throws the heavy fragment
off And then Hal sees ABIN SUR Sees his strange alien
features There’s no mistaking what he is But Hal shows no
fear -- he tries to help Abin

HAL (CONTD)
Man I don’t know what youre supposed to
look like but you don’t look so hot
Abin Sur is beyond concern for his own life now
ABIN SUR

There is no moment like the first There
is so much to envy in you

HAL
That was you talking to me You
brought me here

Abin’s breath is labored

ABIN SUR
Tell me your name
HAL
Hal Jordan
ABIN SUR

Hal Jordan I am Abin Sur Protector of
this sector And today I must die

HAL
Hang on we’ll get you to a hospital
(notices)
That carries purple blood --

ABIN SUR
(points inside)
In there The Lantern Place the Ring
speak the oath

HAL
Hold on Save your strength

And with that Abin finally gives his RING to Hal The
greatest gift in the universe

ABIN SUR
This Ring will take you to what you
cannot yet dream

Hal holds his thin alien frame as Abin draws his last breath
Moved Hal looks at the Ring this strange stranger gave him
Looks to the wreckage of the ship

INSIDE THE CABIN he sees it An object of cold unburnished
steel covered in verdigris THE LANTERN

Hal moves towards it Our expectation rises when Hal’s
cell phone CHIMES “Theme from Magnum PI” RINGTONE

INT TOM’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME - WE INTERCUT

controller in hand He’s pumped

TOM

Hal glances down at Abin’s corpse

HAL
You’d be surprised Listen I need you
to come pick me up

TIME PASSES as Hal finishes the work of burying the stranger
from another world The desert sun rises in the east A

A grey day Mourners gathered around Martin Jordan’s grave
YOUNG HAL stares at the coffin Carl Ferris stands at the
foot of the coffin Opposite Hal on the other side of the
grave sits YOUNG CAROL An ocean of grief between them

CARL FERRIS
Except for his wife and boys there’s
nothing Martin Jordan loved more than
flying Now he can fly forever The
open sky was where he was at home

Hal’s VOICE fades in overlapping with Carl’s --

CARL FERRIS (CONT’D) HAL’S VOICE

going home at last going home at last

EXT CRASH SITE - RESUMING
Hal reverent is addressing the grave

truck pulls up As he gets out

TOM
You want to tell me why we’re a million
miles from nowhere when I’ve got a ton of
code to comb through and I’m sorry but I
didn’t pack a snack and I’m really low
blood sugar cranky right now --

Then he sees it Abin’s ship Too real to mistake for
anything He bolts out No words

TOM (CONTD) HAL
Hal is that a -- Yeah

Tom sees the burial mound understands instantly
TOM (CONTD)
There was something in there
HAL
The pilot died Gave me this
He shows Tom the RING
TOM
He proposed
HAL
He told me to keep it
Tom eyes the strange craft possessively In love

TOM
Did he say anything about his ship

HAL
We just found proof of extraterrestrial
life and you want to strip the guy’s car
for parts

TOM
(hitching it up)
I’1l1 come back for your wreck tomorrow

for a Palsberg Grant Almost

PIPE
You’re here because you’re the only

Screw this I’m a pilot not a Hobbit --

Hal makes his way to the kitchen for a much-needed beer As
he opens the ‘fridge he sees a STRANGE GREEN LIGHT reflected
in the door Hal turns around slowly to see

GREEN WORDS Hovering in the air emanating from the
lantern Cycling through dozens of alien alphabets before
settling on ours Hal reads at first barely a whisper

HAL (CONTD)
“In Brightest Day In Blackest Night”

A LINE of GREEN ENERGY SHOOTS from the LANTERN to Hals ring
and UP HIS ARM He reads growing confident

“No Evil Shall Escape My Sight”

TOUCH the PIECE OF LEGION with his free hand

pulse He looks up to Pipe who peruses Hector’s notes

Take him home We’re done with him

Pipe gives a last look to Abin We sense there’s a story
(and perhaps even a prequel) there

Big open windows bigger drinks Think Gladstones on PCH
Carols with Hal who seems a million miles away

CAROL
So how do we do this Do I give you set
up lines or do you just start gloating
with the entrees

HAL
I’m not really in the mood

CAROL
You should be You always find a way to
screw up my life but sinking our
business unhinging a revolution in
aviation that was classic

HAL
Maybe if your dad could build planes that
didn’t crash --

They’re at it now Old flames same argument

CAROL
I’m curious what’s the statute of
limitations on blaming my father for
everything bad that ever happened to you

HAL
Not everything Just one thing

CAROL
We all lost something that day My
father lost his best friend Not to
mention your brothers or your mom But
we all moved on --

HAL
What did you lose

CAROL
Excuse me

HAL
You said everyone lost something I
wanna know what did you lose

She looks at him sadly

CAROL
What didn’t I After my dad’s breakdown
my parents split up the company nearly
folded Which led to me not going away
for school Which led to me missing out
on all the things I wanted to do with my
life I wanted to see the world not
just the town I grew up in

(finally)

Life’s full of disappointment Hal It’s
still no excuse to wallow in self-pity
and selfishness

HAL
If that’s how you feel why do you even
bother with me --

CAROL
Because when I look at you -- no
matter what I do I still see that kid
searching for his Dad’s parachute

The mixture of regret and pity hanging in the air is too much
for either of them They go back to their meal

Since when did lobsters become impossible
to open

I’1l get it for you It’s okay --

She turns away to grab a waiter

Waiter -- can I get a cracker please

Hal reaches to help when FROM THE RING COMES A HUGE GREEN
HAMMER which SMASHES HER LOBSTER Splat It tape measures
back into the ring before she can see Carol turns back

him Pure will and determination And from that will

OUT OF THE RING comes A TEN FOOT GLOWING GREEN FIST
It FLIES AT THEM -- PUNCHING the THREE MEN across their

faces They FLY BACK Out cold in the sand And just as
quickly the GIANT FIST zips back into the Ring

Hal stares at the Ring A thought passes through him and the
RING BLOSSOMS with LIGHT and suddenly

MOVES WAVES He’s controlling it He thinks it GROWS

It’s snatched in the grip of A GIANT GREEN HAND

grips the buoy far off in the distance Hal pulls his fist
back -- the tendril going taut like a fishing line
tighter until it SLINGSHOTS HAL out towards the ocean

Broome turns to leave but the door LOCKS Broome jiggles
the knob Nothing As he turns back

HECTOR HAMMOND
Actually John I’m just getting started

Hector moves toward Broome WIPING FRAME as we go to
EXT THE PLANET OA

An immense LONG SHOT of a resplendent AQUAMARINE PLANET

The tranquility is broken by HAL shooting out of a wormhole
He skids along the atmosphere like a stone across a pond
until he’s FLOATING in the stratosphere

He looks down at OA Then up to see SINESTRO Hovering
above him Backlit against the Oan suns

SINESTRO
Welcome to Oa

And then Hal passes out

INT A HOTEL-TYPE BEDROOM - LATER

Hal STARTLES awake Startles further when he sees he wearing
the green and black LANTERN UNIFORM He’s even wearing the

famous domino MASK (his pupils a gossamer white) Sinestro
leans against a wall amused

HAL
Am I back home

4l

SINESTRO
In the grand sense yes First
Ringflight triggers a manual return here
to Oa for training

HAL
So I’m still in
looks around beat)
Why does outer space look like a Hyatt

Sinestro waves at a panel which makes the room WARP to a
strange ALIEN DESIGN and back again It’s a HOLOGRAM

SINESTRO
I thought a familiar aesthetic might ease
your transition

HAL
Not unless there’s a fully stocked mini-
bar Who are you

SINESTRO
Thaal Sinestro Protector of Sector
Fourteen-—-

HAL

“Fourteen-Seventeen home to 8012

galaxies 40328 sentient species” --
(stops realizing)

That was not in elementary school Why

does my brain know that

SINESTRO
A maiden voyage to Oa is taxing We took
advantage of your rest to accord you
certain benefits

INT CORPS INDUCTION FACILITY - FLASHBACK

Hal floats naked in midair his head bathed in a green GLOW
Green LASERS beaming directly into Hal’s retinas

SINESTRO (VO)
Knowledge of all Universal Sectors
including your own Sector 2814 has been
placed in your cerebral cortex

JUMP CUT TO Hal’s body SPINS as thick swatches of green
black and white fly on to suit his form

SINESTRO (VO) (CONT’D)
Youve noticed your uniform which
designates you as one of our number

Hal’s head The green DOMINO MASK is CRYSTALLIZING right on
him turning his eyes WHITE

SINESTRO (VO) (CONTD)
The mask is protocol required to be worn
by all Lanterns from planets still
ignorant of life on other worlds

ean

SINESTRO (VO) (CONT’D)
(beat)
Few Lanterns wear them

INT FANCY HOTEL-TYPE BEDROOM - RESUMING

Sinestro moves towards the door which EVAPORATES to allow
his passage Even their “doors” blow Hal (and us) away

SINESTRO
Come Cadets arrive at Oa with much to
learn You even more so Being from
Gaia gives you certain disadvantages

HAL
Gaia You mean Earth

SINESTRO
Is that what you call it now Do you all
still believe the planet is flat

HAL
We’ve got that worked out now thanks

Sinestro’s gone Unable to resist Hal waves at the panel
The hologram flutters in and out Off Hal just beginning to
comprehend this is actually happening

INT THE GREAT HALL - OA - MOMENTS LATER

A place for those who fly more than walk GREEN LANTERNS of
LIMITLESS VARIETY fly and shoot and joke around

The BUILDINGS in the distance are tall as mountains Liquid
towers of living silver The Emerald City of Oz is a dump
by comparison Sinestro notices Hal’s awe

SINESTRO
I have seen sights in this Universe to
make the blindest eye water and I can
tell you there is nothing to compare
with Oa

Hal is struck silent Tomar-Re approaches

TOMAR-RE
Ah Our newest recruit He looks
warm-blooded I am Tomar-Re chosen
protector of Sector 2813 sector nearest
to your own

Hal can’t get over the site of a fish-man talking

HAL
Pretty convenient you all speak English

TOMAR-RE
(his top fin ruffles)
I speak chkgrvchk The ring translates
98 percent of the universes known
linguistic forms Surprisingly your
English is among them

SINESTRO
Your ring is the most powerful weapon in
the universe

INT THE TRAINING ARENA - OA - MOMENTS LATER

Corps members train An elegant ballet as they conjure an
endless variety of WEAPONS Like Samurai running through
morning exercises Hal watches boyhood fantasy blown away

SINESTRO (VO)
Its constructs are limited only by your
imagination Its strength limited only
by your will

Hal turns to what looks like a PILE of struggling GLs

HAL
What are they fighting

SINESTRO
Your instructor Killowog

The GLs suddenly go FLYING in all directions having been
thrown off by KILLOWOG a gargantuan rhino-creature He
lumbers over Looks down on Hal from ten feet high --

KILLOWOG
So you’re the Poozer from 2814
(sniffs)
You smell funny
(leans in close heheheh)
We’re gonna have fun training you

We’re not sure if Hal will ever speak again

SINESTRO (VO)
The Ring’s power comes from the Central
Battery

EXT THE CENTRAL BATTERY - OA - MOMENTS LATER

High atop an opaline plinth stands THE CENTRAL BATTERY (from
our opening) Majestic Enormous CRACKLING with energy

SINESTRO (V0O)
It fuels every lantern which in turn
fuels every ring

LANTERNS fly around and up to it charging their rings with
the formality of the righteous on pilgrimage to holy ground
FIND Hal and Sinestro below minute in comparison

HAL

So this is what makes all that green
SINESTRO

Green the light you see is only a

manifestation of what your mind cannot
comprehend

HAL
You lost me at “manifestation”

SINESTRO

All life is connected By love by hope
by all the noblest instincts of the soul
This is the center of that connection
The power drawn from that connection is
what you see simply as “green”

(gestures to the Battery)
All that power collected channeled
here delivered Entrusted to us

We can tell Hal is daunted by the grandeur of it all

SINESTRO (CONT’D)
Come let us pay our respects

Sinestro motions toward a waiting LINE of LANTERNS All

manner of CREATURES assembled before a MAGENTA-SKINNED WOMAN

Abin’s widow LIANA Regal in her sadness She sees them
approach Breaking ceremony she goes straight to Hal

LIANA
You bear my husbands ring

Hal doesn’t know how to answer

LIANA (CONTD)
You saw him You were with Abin Sur when
he died

HAL
Yes

LIANA
A thousand years together and a thousand
more taken from us

Hal can see the pain of loss He knows it too well

HAL
He told me to tell you he loved you
With his last breath

These words give her more comfort than the hundreds of well-
wishers She restrains a well-spring of emotion

LIANA
You wear the ring of a fine soldier
There are many who will miss him Even
more who owe him thanks Do it justice

EXT THE CENTRAL BATTERY - MOMENTS LATER

As Hal and Sinestro re-enter Hal studies the Battery closer
now A mixture of emotions cascading over him

SINESTRO
You lied to her and think it kind You
are human

Hal TOUCHES the base wall of the Battery as he does his ring
FLICKERS A HOLOGRAM manifests a rotating CORPS SYMBOL

HAL
Um is it supposed to do that

SINESTRO
A fallen Lantern will sometimes dictate a
final transmission to reveal itself
before the Central Battery --

Sinestro waits The logo FLICKERS into the face of

LEGION Ferociously ATTACKING ABIN We’re re-watching
Abin’s spacefight with Legion as a GIANT GREEN HOLOGRAM

ABIN SUR’S VOICE
This is Abin Sur -- I have seen what
hunts us -- Legion -- it lives --

INT THE CITADEL - OA

Sinestro stands beside Hal projecting Abin’s message for the
GUARDIANS to see The horrible hologram REPLAYS on a loop

ABIN SUR’S VOICE
The ring holds no effect no defense --
You must take action Legion is real

SINESTRO
“Legion is real” The dying words of our
most noble soldier

He points to the image of the snarling hellbeast

SINESTRO (CONTD)

Legion -- taking its revenge for offenses
long forgotten to all but itself And
ou the Guardians of our Universe

A GUARDIAN (VO)
What is it you desire Thaal Sinestro

SINESTRO
A Golden Light to match Legions If our
enemies command such power we must too

A GUARDIAN (VO)
It is agreed action must be taken

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
Gather your Lanterns Seek the beast out
and contain it

A GUARDIAN (VO)
Return with Legion defeated And we will
consider your request

Sinestro is far from sated with their answer

A GUARDIAN (V0) (CONTD)
We have faith in you Thaal Sinestro
And in the Lanterns at your side

Hal takes one last look at Legion which is currently
ROARING in his face as we HARD CUT TO

INT THE GREAT HALL - OA
Hal storms out moving somewhere anywhere --

SINESTRO
We were given leave to find Legion

HAL
You were I’m going home If you’re ever
near Gaia pop over we’ll grab a drink

SINESTRO
You are a member of the Corps now
You took an oath

HAL
I recited a poem floating in my
apartment It doesn’t make that giant
Spacemonster my problem

SINESTRO
The Ring chose you Hal

HAL
The Ring made a mistake

SINESTRO
Rings do not make mistakes Lanterns do

HAL

And Id make a million of ‘em Trust me

(then re his Ring)
Look I had a good life before this
showed up Before rhino instructors and
purple widows who quite frankly made me
feel really guilty This whole alien
army deal it’s not my thing

SINESTRO
Legion was in your sector Hal In your
home system If any trace of that demon
fell to your planet along with Abin it
will ravage your homeworld like a cancer
A look crosses Hal’s face Is it worry He catches himself
HAL
See the Ring did make a mistake
Because another guy -- he would care
EXT TRANSPORT BAY - OA

Hal’s on a PLATFORM Tomar-Re and Sinestro instruct him

TOMAR-RE
Leaving Well the Ring adheres to your
will Simply will yourself home

HAL
Where do I FedEx it when I’m done

SINESTRO
The Ring has selected you It is yours
until you fall in battle Or elsewhere
(a little grim)
We await your return Hal Jordan

Hal gives a nervous look -- then LIGHTING UP IN HIS GREEN

“It’s a bit like animating a puppet A

Broome tries to plead for his life But all of a sudden
finds he can’t speak

“Although I can control the subject’s jaw
and tongue efforts at creating speech

Thank you Senator

The Aide takes documents and exits --

SENATOR HAMMOND
Sorry to make you wait

No problem Dad Not like I’ve got
anything better to do

And we realize this is SENATOR HAMMOND Hector’s father He
produces a TICKET clipped to a FLIER

invited me to fly -- a slab of butter to

hes always suspected his father thought about him

recrystalizes back into his regular clothes

It’s not hard to figure out We had our
first serious conversation in years and
your 12 year-old brain couldnt take it
so you bolted

The air show’s tomorrow They’re making
sure the Senator’s F-16 is flight-ready

Well that wasn’t exactly Plan A but it
turns out one of my pilots screwed the
pooch on the flight demo

Meaning Hal Who looks over the line of aircraft eager

HAL
So which one of these bad boys is mine

CAROL
Well let’s see Not this one Or
this one Not this one either That’s
the thing about being grounded you stay

can’t win then spots a way for his day to get worse

walks to it Tom approaches He flips Hal the Mustang KEYS

on its feet now applauding But it ain’t over yet as --

SPIRALS its way overhead A GREEN BOLT OF LIGHT FLARES from
where the Green Lantern just stood as --

INSIDE THE COCKPIT the SENATOR SCREAMS Unable to eject

THE GREEN BOLT OF LIGHT races the runaway jet -- blindingly
fast outpacing it -- until the green blast MORPHS into --

A HUGE NET WHICH CATCHES THE FALCON It pulls taut
straining THE SHOT RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE NET to its
source THE GREEN LANTERN pulling with all his strength
It nearly yanks his shoulders from their sockets

BACK WITH HECTOR -- Concentrating on his father’s Falcon
fighting against Green Lantern’s amazing strength -- and
losing PAIN surges through Hector’s body -- as he “pushes”
harder with his power -- but --

Green Lantern has the Falcon secure The strain becomes too
much for Hector -- and the buildup of his power is RELEASED
FIRING OUT in a WAVE -- which blindsides Falcon 3 The jet
is suddenly PROPELLED with the full force of Hector’s mind

The PILOT EJECTS -- but --FALCON 3 CRASHES INTO THE BASE OF
THE CONTROL TOWER

A massive EXPLOSION of jet fuel A scream of tortured metal
as THE TOWER LURCHES FORWARD

Defeated Hector ducks into the crowd instinctively grabbing
his head in pain to quell the mounting pain as --

measures back into GL’s Ring But there’s no time to
celebrate as he BLAZES towards the tower

Stay there Nathan

No thought to her own safety Carol climbs onto the glass to
get him CRACKS spindle even further She reaches out
and HEAVES Nathan up OVER TO SAFETY -- but

The momentum CATAPULTS her forward further on to the
sloooowly shattering window and -- THROUGH IT

CAROL FALLS to the fiery ground below Seconds become
milliseconds Death’s arms opening wide until --

GREEN LANTERN catches her Holding her close as he ZIPS her
away from the rushing ground

And in one fluid motion GL whips around ring blazing to
project a GIANT HAND that PUSHES the leaning tower upright
A SECOND BLAST fuses the metal at the base The tower
stabilizes

ON CAROL -- who can’t believe it all For the first time in
Hal’s life someone looks at him like a hero It feels good

So does the ROAR from the euphoric crowd below as the GREEN
LANTERN flies off with Carol on his arm over their heads and
into the night sky Brilliant green against midnight blue

INT AIRFIELD BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

SLAM Hector stumbles to the sinks His hands pressed to
his THROBBING forehead in electric pain A gale-force
migraine burrowing into his brain

He reaches to splash water on his face but can’t make it
SLUMPING to the floor Something is happening to him his
head He howls in pain as his glasses SNAP OFF HIS FACE

It’s too much -- he PASSES OUT As we PUSH IN on Hector the
vein in his head PULSING sickeningly CUT TO

Calm down Flyboy Catch your breath

A SERIES OF CUTS
As Hal walks Nathan home

NATHAN
Do you think he’s an alien or mutant or
both Or maybe he’s a regular guy who
got his powers from a nuclear accident

As Nathan brushes his teeth Hal watches

NATHAN (CONTD)
Wait then there’d be radiation from all
his laser beams and everybody he savedd
grow like extra arms or a third eye

As Hal puts Nathan to bed

NATHAN (CONT’D)
Maybe he gets his powers from his suit so
anybody who wears it’d be able to fly
around What do you think Uncle Hal

HAL
(spitballing)
Maybe he’s one of 3600 space police who

it Super-person

That someone like that is real

someone like that around fifteen years

He’s reacting to the odd bulge at Hector’s temples

Never better Lately I’ve been
interested in space exploration I was
thinking of making a major donation

Good thinking It’s a fine cause

Hal trails Sinestro as they FLY over the city -- up and
through the fantastical architecture

SINESTRO
Next time when a friend gives you
warning heed it

HAL
I know I screwed up But I need your
help now How do I stop him

SINESTRO
You can’t Not alone at least

HAL
I thought this Ring was the most powerful
weapon in the Universe

SINESTRO
Would that it were

HAL
I don’t get it What is Legion anyway

Sinestro STOPS Landing atop the highest building All of
marvelous Oa behind him He faces Hal Gravely serious

SINESTRO
Legion is the Guardians’ shame

Sinestro extends his ring up and FIRES IMAGES UNFURL
Beginning with A GIANT BOOK pages fluttering open

SINESTRO (CONT’D)
There are teachings in the Book of Oa the
Guardians would not have us know But
moments we would prefer forgotten are
still moments in time

The IMAGES OF HIS RING CONTINUE so we INTERCUT between the
pictographic storytelling and -- FLASHBACKS to

EXT TRINITY CANYON - OA - FLASHBACK
The Guardians float in a ring over a continental crevasse

SINESTRO (VO)
In their efforts to protect the Universe
the Guardians sought to harness the
emanations of light But they did not
begin with Will They began with a force

far more potent With Will’s opposite
Their cumulative concentration culminates and A Guardian
swipes the air A THIN YELLOW FLAME -- the color of Legion --

appears in his palm

SINESTRO (VO) (CONTD)
Fear

The Guardian passes the meager flame to his neighbor It
grows Until the flame becomes a BLAZE burning one of them
The blaze widens beyond their circle

SINESTRO (VO) (CONT’D)
But the light of Fear could not be
controlled Even by the Guardians

The YELLOW BLAZE rips out of orbit towards the stars A wash
of toxic light spanning Creation

SINESTRO (VO) (CONT’D)
It spread Throughout Creation Taking
what is good and polluting it with Fear
And all things changed

EXT ROCKY PLANET - FLASHBACK

Craggy barren Two LIZARD CREATURES share their scavengings
as THE YELLOW BLAZE passes over them like a tide

SINESTRO (VO)
In trying to bring order to the cosmos
the Guardians unleashed chaos

The lizards’ expressions turn malevolent Distrusting their
brother They ATTACK EACH OTHER with a new ferocity

SINESTRO (V0O) (CONT’D)
The Guardians saw their mistake And
they took action They collected this
light of Fear

EXT ABOVE OA - ORBIT - FLASHBACK

The Guardians in a circle again Only now FACING OUTWARD
With their combined efforts the thin tendrils of Golden Light
return to their circle from all directions in the Universe

They collect the noxious Light into A FORM above them

SINESTRO (VO)
And once gathered they banished it

EXT THE LOST SECTOR - FLASHBACK

A starless space Blacker and bleaker than the singularity
at the center of a black hole

SINESTRO (VO)
To the Lost Sector A place of
containment A place to keep safe the
Guardians’ failures

The yellow torrent is cast within It spirals inside -- a
cyclone of fear and rage It twists and writhes coalescing
No longer merely a Light But a Life A nascent Beast lets
out a wild PRIMORDIAL HOWL

SINESTRO (VO) (CONTD)
But in that dark place the Fear grew
strength And form And shape
The swirl of fire MORPHS into a very familiar shape Legion

SINESTRO (V0) (CONTD)
And its rage was legion

The HOLOGRAM FADES AWAY as we TUMBLE down through --

INT SCIENCELLS - UNDERGROUND - OA - RESUMING

Sinestro leads Hal through an UNDERGROUND EDIFICE A
catacomb of CRYSTALLINE structure repeated matrices of GREEN
CELLS stretching on into fractal infinity

HAL
They made Legion

SINESTRO
That is why it hunts us To take revenge
on its captors And creators

In answer Sinestro SWOOPS down lower into the Sciencells

SINESTRO (CONT’D)
With the Guardians’ permission I led a
phalanx of Lanterns to scour all sectors
Even with our combined efforts our
combined will it killed thirty-three of
our number

HAL
I’m sorry

Finally Sinestro LANDS at his destination
SINESTRO

Yes Sometimes victory comes at too high
a price

HAL
Victory

SINESTRO
The Lanterns do not leave evil unbridled

Sinestro opens a CELL DOOR -- and he shows Hal why he’s
brought him here Hal’s eyes go wide with surprise -- and
horror -- at the sight of --

LEGION Captured Trapped by CHAINS OF GREEN ENERGY

A DOZEN LANTERNS (some wounded) keep a STEADY STREAM OF
RINGFIRE trained on Legion It thrashes and brays straining
with effort to escape the pain and confinement SHRIEKING
with a rage to make the Devil piss his pants

HAL
You didn’t kill it

SINESTRO
The Corps does not kill Certainly not
before Legion can repay its debt of
death

(approaching Legion)

The Guardians have seen enough death to
permit what true and final security
requires The forming of a new ring A
more powerful one

HAL
(understanding)
Of Fear
Sinestro’s eyes flash Oh Yes As if understanding
Legion BELLOWS Hal may have his doubts on how right any of
this is -- but that’s not why he came back here
HAL (CONTD)

A piece of that is still on my planet
If the Guardians let you go after the
motherload they have to help me stop
his spawnling back home

SINESTRO
I pray they will Or soon you will have
no home left
And with that dark warning and Legion’s black ROAR
GUARDIAN (PRELAP)
We will dispatch the Corps to your
planet’s aid Hal Jordan of Gaia --
INT THE CITADEL -— OA

Hal stands before the ringed assemblage of Guardians They
loom like planets set against the night sky above

HAL
Thank you --

A GUARDIAN (V0)
Once you complete your cadet training on
Oa Not before

Theyre refusing Hal cant believe what he’s hearing

HAL
But I don’t understand

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
The Corps defends its own --

A GUARDIAN (V0)
-- And you are not yet of the Corps

HAL
I thought “the Corps” was supposed to
protect the universe -- Earth is in the
universe We need help And youre
gonna let people die because I didn’t go
through your damn boot camp

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
Some measure of suffering is universal
There is always danger --

HAL
Well this danger is killing members of my
species You guys made that thing you
have to do something

The Guardians disapprove of his outburst and respond with a

thunderous SHOUT into his mind laying down their law --

A GUARDIAN (V0)
The counterweight to suffering is the
Lantern and his Ring --

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
-- Gaia is in Sector 2814 --

A GUARDIAN (V0)
-- If the Lantern assigned to its
protection is not able --

ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
-- If he does not yet know how to
manifest his ring’s potential --

A GUARDIAN (VO)
-- The fault lies with him Alone

Off their harsh condemnation -- and refusal -- A SHRIEK
rises loud enough to match Hal’s anger right now as --

INT SCIENCELLS - LEGION’S CELL - THAT MOMENT
Sinestro approaches Legion reverentially like an apostl

FOUR OTHER LANTERNS flank him as he nears the monster
Ring GLOWS and cruelly BINDS LEGION’S LIMBS --

e
His

84

A GUARDIAN (VO)
The Ring is the most powerful weapon in
all creation Used irresponsibly it can
produce evil greater than anything the
Corps was formed to oppose

Sinestro conjures a row of SHARP PRECISION INSTRUMENTS
ANOTHER GUARDIAN (VO)
It is why we have imparted rules
governing its use To prevent anarchy
Sinestro uses a SCALPEL TO CUT INTO LEGION’S HIDE Legion
REELS Straining against the green chains that bind him
They grow TAUT

A GUARDIAN (VO)
To prevent catastrophe

And SNAP Sinestro reacts instantly pointing -- FIRING --

SINESTRO
Secure it

INT CITADEL - RESUMING
Hal is shaking his head growing ever more frustrated

A GUARDIAN (VO)
Do you understand Hal Jordan of Gaia

HAL
If your training is just gonna teach me
how to let people down I already know

how to do that
Plink Hal has just set his Ring down on the marble pillar

HAL (CONTD)

Earth may be a primitive planet but you
guys with your whole bureaucracy
youd fit in just great there

Hal’s Uniform SHIMMERS off him replaced by his clothes All
his power gone refused The Guardians stare in disbelief

HAL (CONT’D)
Keep your Ring I might not have the
will of all that lives behind me but I
have my will to do what I can I’11 beat
this guy on my own

And Hal turns his back on the gods

INT THE GREAT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Hal exits quickly met by TWO GREEN LANTERNS a WING-EARED

WOMAN and an ivory-colored FEATURELESS MAN They flank him
ominously leading him towards the landingflight platform

Wing-Ears says something in a SQUALKY ALIEN LANGUAGE

HAL
Sorry No ring no speaky alien So how
do we do this You fly me home Or do
you give me a loaner Ring --

Instead of an answer -- Wing-Ears drops suddenly Cut down
by a YELLOW BLAST Hal looks up to see it

LEGION

is clawing its way out of the Sciencells Featureless
Lantern shouts at Hal in alien before Legion’s BLAST
knocks him to the ground Hal looks up Lanterns mobilize
from all directions FLYING Falling into --

AN INSTANT FORMATION OF LANTERNS

Hal ducks for cover as they whip overhead calling up weapons
and ATTACKING LEGION But Legion lets loose with its hot
hateful BLASTS -- the Lanterns are easily repelled

TWO MORE DIE in an instant Hal looks down to the fallen
Lanterns at his feet kneels down to them

They might look different but these are his brothers
PUSH IN ON HAL as --

He takes off the fallen Lantern’s ring And does the same
thing with the others

EXT OA - OUTSIDE THE SCIENCELLS

Glass and metal rain down as LEGION’S CLAWS explode through
the outer wall The monster wrenches its way out of
captivity like a demon hatching from a egg

EVERY AVAILABLE LANTERN mobilizes -- Kilowog and Tomar-Re and
the CADETS -- all swarming like hornets conjuring all manner
of weapons and blasts all useless as --

LEGION FLIES UP

In unison the Lanterns CRISSCROSS the sky with weblike-
BEAMS Legion SWATS LANTERNS ASIDE PULSES EXPLODING from
its jaws Lanterns fall and die making a hole in the sky
cover Legion is about to escape through it -- when --

A SCIMITAR SLICES OFF ONE OF ITS CLAWS

SINESTRO stands in its way His four blades swinging
Valiant but no match for Legion In an instant Sinestro is
grabbed Legion enjoys a moment of delight about to take
his head off in its endless fangs when --

A SHOCKINGLY POWERFUL RINGBLAST STRIKES LEGION

The momentary distraction causes it to RELEASE Sinestro --
turning its attention to its new attacker --

IT’S HAL BACK IN UNIFORM

WIELDING A POWER RING ON EACH FINGER A master of ten Rings

HAL
Yeah I really need more training

Hal’s Rings conjure up an army of objects -- SAMURAI SWORDS
ASSORTED WEAPONRY -- anything he can think of to distract
Legion from the others He succeeds -- Legion has a taste
for only his blood now And RACES for Hal Bait taken

THE CHASE BEGINS
EXT THE OAN SKIES

Hal flies fast leading Legion away -- slaloms and twists
weaving around the towers that rocket past Legion just
SMASHES through them Pursuing relentlessly

Hal rockets HIGHER -- where SINESTRO flies to his side --
matching his speed Hal couldn’t be happier for the help

HAL
Glad you could make it

Together they FIRE an arsenal of GREEN WEAPONS that work in
elegant SEQUENCE to whittle away at Legion’s strength We

see in these two the makings of a legendary team

But Legion is only scuffed not stopped Sinestro and Hal
barely dodge an EXPLOSIVE PULSE that takes out a BUILDING

HAL (CONT’D)
(yelling)
Am I allowed to kill him yet

SINESTRO
No number of rings will be enough to slay
Legion

HAL
I wasn’t gonna use the Rings

Hal loops around a DOME Legion SWIPES CRACKING THE DOME
WIDE OPEN -- REVEALING inside --

THE CENTRAL BATTERY

Crackling with infinite power He flies right for it --
FIRING AHEAD RIGHT INTO THE BATTERY We start to get the
idea that Hal has a plan And it’s a dumb one

He FIRES again -- right into the core -- which starts to
GLOW a nuclear bomb arming itself Growing LOUDER and
LOUDER until we feel its power surging OVERLOADING

LIGHTNING FIRES ALL AROUND STRIKING HAL But he holds his
fire INTO the Battery

SINESTRO
Get out now Youll die

HAL
(straining)
Just promise you’ll help my people
Sinestro nods He will Hal made braver by that promise

FIRES ONE LAST TIME -- INTO THE BATTERY -- which PULSES --
and ROILS -- until it finally gives out --

EXPLODING WITH POWER

A GREEN DETONATION like the Big Bang itself traveling
STRAIGHT THROUGH HAL

Coursing through his body It’s too much Hal holds it
together just long enough to bring his hands together --
channelling all that endless energy to --

FIRE WITH EVERYTHING HE HAS AT LEGION

A RINGLBLAST THE LIKES OF WHICH GOD HAS NEVER SEEN The
combined power of all life expended at once So much energy
the RINGS ON HIS HAND DISINTEGRATE

It is finally enough Legion is stricken And dies

The Lanterns who have come to witness the unthinkable feat
watch as Legion drops The nightmare ended The Corps’
surprise only outdone by their shock when they see --

HAL

still hanging in the sky He plummets Lifelessly He
POUNDS into the ground at the foot of the CRACKED and SPENT
battery

Sinestro and Tomar-Re are the first to reach him The smoke
starts to clear REVEALING Hal Unmoving

He is a hero today And he is dead

At least that’s what we think Until Hal shudders and
coughs Life returning Beaten up but still Hal

HAL (CONT’D)
(weak and la post-dogfight)
Well that was easy

Sinestro helps him to his feet Hal’s temples are now GREY
(Fanboys orgasm appropriately)

TOMAR-RE
You should be dead
HAL
Don’t sound so disappointed

Sinestro turns to ALL THE LANTERNS who have assembled

SINESTRO

Hal Jordan of Gaia came here seeking our
help and saved us instead

(then)
Today we show him how the Corps defends
its own For he has proven he is one of
us If his planet needs help it will
find us ready It will see a storm

The Lanterns CHEER Raising their Rings in unison
EXT SPACE

Appreciative holding her father Carol is distracted by

INT SHOWROOM HANGAR - THAT MOMENT

Carl moves through his workspace flicking off the lights one
by one He lingers over a Sabre model Saying goodbye

CARL FERRIS
Sorry Martin Let you down again

A moment of regret And Carl is suddenly SUCKED out of the
showroom -- CRASHING THROUGH a glass partition -- into --

The hangar He hangs in mid-air floating above one of the
SABRE PROTOTYPES terrified by the sight of

A GARGANTUAN HEAD It lists to one side neck no longer able
to support it fully We PAN DOWN over the cracked and
mottled scalp to recognize --
HECTOR His body useless He drools slightly His hands
tremble curled into claws around the arm of a WHEELCHAIR
pushed by haggard and disheveled BROOME a hellish orderly
HECTOR HAMMOND

Excuse me I’m looking for a Mr Hal

Jordan You know where I can find him
Carl stares back bloody and scared

CARL FERRIS
What are you --

Hector sighs as if he’s being put out

HECTOR HAMMOND

HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
Fine How about we bring him to us

His brow furrows and the engine FOOMS to life
INT FALLOUT SHELTER - RESUMING

TOM
It’s a prototype I’m working on a
cross-model design sorta thing took some
fuselages and probably won’t even fly
I thought of it when I was stoned --

CAROL
Do you honestly think I can’t recognize a
SPACESHIP when I see one

TOM
(flinching)
It’s not my fault -- just don’t hit me --

Before Carol can press the room is ROCKED by a THUNDERCLAP
from outside Carol BOLTS out Tom trailing as --

EXT FERRIS AIRCRAFT —- TARMAC - SECONDS LATER

TAKES OFF soaring into the horizon

Carol and Tom race across the pavement back to

Carol runs in -- Tom behind her -- but the sight of her
father writhing in mid-air freezes them in their tracks

CAROL

Her gasp snares Hector’s attention A MEMORY HIT Carol’s
face from Hal’s minds eye Hector grins “recognizing” her

Focusing on Carol Hector’s brow furrows using his new
power ANOTHER MEMORY Carol in “Paris” almost kissing GL

This is his fault It’s because of him
I’m this monster

EXT COAST CITY - THAT MOMENT

A pair of Sabres shoot over the coastline BANKING towards
homes and buildings

At the Ferris Wheel zenith Jim’s bored out of his mind as
Nathan presses his face to the gondola window entranced

NATHAN
Hey Dad
(pointing)
What’re those
Jim glances up to see two SABRES bearing down on them

No time to panic or answer as -- the Sabres split DIVING
towards the base of the ride -- GUNS BLAZING --

The wheelhouse CRUMPLES Metal cries in protest and

The entire structure starts to topple Like a redwood felled
and falling casting its vast SHADOW on the ground over

HELEN Feet rooted by fear

NATHAN lets out a SHRIEK -- Jim pulls Nathan close as they
fall -- it’s over --

Until the ENTIRE WHEEL is suddenly awash in GREEN LIGHT
Nathan and Jim open their eyes to see

A RHINO-SHAPED LANTERN KILLOWOG A FORCEFIELD from his
Ring holding the wheel then setting it upright

THE LANTERNS split off like fireworks streaks of emerald
blazing in all directions to address Hector’s mayhem

A SERIES OF CUTS AS

Killowog ring-welds the Ferris Wheel’s base secure

One of the Sabres DECIMATES the rollercoaster’s TRACK The
‘coaster FLIES off the rails about to CRUSH terrified
bystanders before being caught by a HUGE GREEN CLAW
Manifested by TOMAR-RE’S Ring

The Sabre comes around for another try buzzing the
boardwalk The crowd FLEES a TIDAL WAVE of people but
SINESTRO stands his ground awaiting the Sabre’s approach
like a gunfighter

THE OTHER LANTERNS crisscross over the city One stops a
LANDSLIDE with a GIANT GREEN SHOVEL Another rescues a
family from a collapsing building A SCHOOL BUS is set right
after teetering over an overpass

The PEOPLE’S appreciation overwhelms their fear of the
strange creatures saving them

BACK ON THE BOARDWALK

Sinestro and Hal side by side manifest the weapons that
dispatched Legion Scimitar and Samurai sword and SLICE
through the horde of U-CAVs flying right at them

Through the SMOKE they see two last Sabres coming at them
Sinestro prepares poising his scimitars

INT SHOWROOM HANGAR - 18 SECONDS LATER

A human-sized bullet hole RIPS open as GL bursts through He

searches No sign of Carol But --

TOM and CARL are held captive lifted high above a WHIRLWIND
of TOOLS and HEAVY EQUIPMENT SWIRLING around them dangerously
close All by HECTOR who’s slavering for the fight A

monster in a chair his vile head housing his murderous mind

HECTOR HAMMOND
You’re late I almost had to kill
everyone without you

Hector tries to penetrate Hal’s mind with his own -- to
CONTROL HIM -- but Hal’s aura shines brighter than ever

HECTOR HAMMOND
Sure

With a raised brow Carl and Tom go flying out the hangar
EXT TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

THAT GREEN HAND catches Carl and Tom Places them safely
INT SHOWROOM HANGAR - RESUMING

Annoyed Hector FIRES the maelstrom of metal at GL -- who
conjures a SHIELD to deflect it (A PIECE KNOCKS BROOME back
and unconscious) Hector’s chair wheels toward GL
confidently He makes a rag rise to wipe his sticky chin

HECTOR HAMMOND
Nice But not enough to save her
Your Carol
(knowingly)
I could see you all over her mind
years of disappointment Only to
disappoint her now One last time

Hal turns to Hector rage in his eyes --

HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)

Every memory she had of you is filled
with regret the years wasted waiting
for you You never did a thing for her
until someone gave you that ring

(eyes lighting up at the RING)
You don’t deserve all that power
Without that ring you’re not a hero
You’re barely even a man

GREEN LANTERN
(through his teeth)
Where Is She

HECTOR HAMMOND
Relax She’s right here

Hector glances over to that first Sabre prototype GL’s eyes
go wide when he sees Carol In the translucent PAYLOAD of
the U-CAV Trapped Pounding on the soundproofed plexi

Hector relishes the obvious pain on GL’s face
HECTOR HAMMOND (CONTD)
Now from what I’ve seen of your
childhood you don’t have such a good
history with plane crashes
Hector’s eyes close The Sabre’s engines FIRE

NEARBY The guidance computer LOCKS on a DESTINATION A
MOUNTAIN RANGE The trajectory of Carols death plotted

HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
All that power and you can’t do a thing
Youre paralyzed Get it
(laughing the point of it all)
Now you know what it’s like to be me

The Sabre’s engines ready for take-off GL steals a look
back at Carol Their eyes lock Sympathy Regret

GL can’t let her down Not again

GREEN LANTERN
But you don’t know what it’s like to be
me You want power Real power Just
let her go And I’11 give you this

He shows HIS RING We fear for the choice he is making

GREEN LANTERN (CONT’D)
This Ring can give you more power than
you knew existed Its only limit is what
you can hold in your mind And your mind
is a lot bigger than mine

Hector’s eyes light up at the thought

GREEN LANTERN (CONTD)
With this you can do anything Be
anything You can kill me as many times
as you want You can rule the world

(a final bargain)
All you have to do is let her go

Hector considers the shiny offer The WHINE of the Sabre’s
engines MOUNTS And finally -- SLOWING It’s a deal

HECTOR HAMMOND
Fine Take her

In response GL removes his Ring He opens his palm and
the Ring FLOATS UPWARD Pulled towards Hector by his mind

As the ring leaves Hal GL’s uniform dissolves And

FOOM THE SABRE TAKES OFF With Carol still trapped inside
(And before she could see GL’s true face)

HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
Sorry I lied

The ring flies to Hector’s hand And the second it does --
Carol BLASTS into the sky Off to her death

Hector EXPLODES the GUIDANCE COMPUTER with his mind Fear
fills Hal’s face as he watches his love recede into the sky --
he turns to see - HECTOR -- as he --

PUTS ON THE RING

The Ring GLOWS instantly with the connection ENERGY BEAMING
all around The LUCENT AURA LIGHTS AROUND HIM and

He RISES from his wheelchair the aura giving him the
strength his body lacks

Hector’s eyes grow wide with rapture His face ecstatic
He knows now what true power is

A flick of his wrist and he makes the WALL EXPLODE with GREEN
LIGHTNING Another and CRAGGLY CLAWED FINGERS (his version
of the Green Hand) RIP THE GROUND OPEN underfoot

SOMETHING GROWS out of the Ring RIPPING THROUGH THE GROUND
-- UP HIGHER -- THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE HANGAR -- A MASSIVE
CONSTRUCT -- Hector has the exultant look of a man just
named messiah

As Hector’s mountainous creation grows its spires begin to
CHANGE MORPHING into TENTACLES The entire construct’s
shape momentarily takes on the full form of

LEGION

IT FLARES Twisting and writhing The Ring’s power is too

much for Hector There’s A FLASH OF WORRY on HECTOR’S FACE
as the energy becomes TOO MUCH FOR HIM Hal grins

HAL
I lied too You weren’t chosen

Hector gets it now He doesn’t possess the will to control
the Ring -- until finally --

The ENERGY SURGES BACK DOWN Hector WAILS as all that energy
FIRES BACK AT HIM

AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT AND HEAT -- SEARING HECTOR

And it’s all gone Mangled mutated Hector has fallen back
into his chair twitching cataplectic And so he’ll stay
Of its own accord THE RING zips off Hector’s finger and
Flies right back into Hal’s hand

BROOME
That’s for making me rob a bank asshole

Broome looks up to thank his savior but Hal is already
BOLTING OUT -- chasing after Carol in the Sabre

fly -- BUT THE RING ONLY PULSES

IT HAS NO CHARGE LEFT The Ring can’t help him anymore

He looks His underground lair is a half mile off And the
Sabre is getting further away by the second closer to the
MOUNTAIN RANGE

Hal looks around -- his eyes landing on something and it
fills him with courage

AN F-16

waiting on the tarmac Without a second’s hesitation HAL
POUNDS FOR IT TOM approaches catching up --

TOM
What are you doing Use your ring

HAL
There isn’t enough time to charge it
She’s heading for the Maker Cliffs It’s
gonna crash

TOM
What are you gonna do
HAL
(as he climbs in the jet)
Stop it

How

HAL
I got the ride to figure that out

But he doesn’t need a ring Just aman Still a hero As

struggle muffled She sees the CLIFFS coming up ahead -- her
fear doubles She BASHES helplessly against the glass as --

swoops down in pursuit He’s caught up to the Sabre -- just
a few feet behind Carol now Hal swerves his F-16 ahead --

TRYING TO CATCH IT IN HIS SLIPSTREAM AND FORCING A TU --
but the Sabre presses on relentlessly making its straight
line for

Hal tries again BARRELLING over the U-CAV dangerously close
trying to PHYSICALLY PUSH IT DOWN But the Sabre is able to
maneuver out of every move Hal can think of And the CLIFFS
are DEAD AHEAD How the hell is he going to stop that thing

TOM (FROM HEADSET) (CONTD)
There’s nothing you can do

HAL (INTO HEADSET)
I can’t let her die

PULLS a switch that ARMS A WARNING LIGHT Tom reacts to what
he sees on his display Hal’s “plan”

TOM (INTO HEADSET) (CONTD)
Hal Nonono You can’t do it You’ll
hit the jet you’ll both die

And without a single thought for himself Hal YANKS a RED
LEVER Hard In an instant --

MARTIN JORDAN (VO) HAL
I’m clear Ejecting now -- I’m clear Ejecting now --

THE COCKPIT CANOPY EXPLODES HAL LURCHES UPWARD OUT OF THE
PLANE AND INTO THE SKY HE JUST HIT THE EJECTOR SEAT

In an instant Hal’s PARACHUTE deploys and entangles onto the

SABRE He SLAMS PAINFULLY AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE SABRE
CONTACT Like he just jumped from one train car to another
only at 10000 feet and nearing the sound barrier

Hal pulls against the crushing WINDSHEAR up the ‘chute --
closer His fingers SNAG the wing of the U-CAV With
impossible effort he PULLS himself up to the nose

CAROL is POUNDING on the payload from the inside now
SCREAMING And then she sees him HAL JORDAN What the
fuck is he doing on her plane

Hal sees the CLIFFS AHEAD -- they are SECONDS away from
impact He reaches for a PANEL on the top of the fuselage
Digs in and RIPS it open -- exposing a BUTTON Which he

PUNCHES THE PAYLOAD CANOPY goes FLYING Hal reaches in and
pulls Carol up Wind rips into them

CAROL

HAL WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

SAVING YOU
He grabs her FALLING BACKWARDS And --
THEY FALL
Above them the Sabre speeds off ahead -- and --
EXPLODES INTO THE CLIFFS
They may have been saved from that -- but they’re in FREE-
FALL No Ring No chute Just Hal and Carol clutching each
other as they achieve bone pulverizing terminal velocity
Tumbling in each other’s arms The air ROARING The
GROUND COMING UP FAST Death is seconds away
They hold each other tight The wind to painful too speak

But they don’t have to -- they both know it They have loved
each other their whole lives They love each other still

Nothing left to do they clutch each other even harder and

They kiss A lifetime’s worth of love shared in the one
moment left before their deaths The tenderest goodbye

SINESTRO (V0O)
All life is connected By love by hope
by ali the noblest instincts of the soul

If ever a kiss embodied those noblest instincts it is this
one All that passion unbridled

SINESTRO (VO) (CONT’D)
The power drawn from that connection is
what you see simply as “green”

The Ring feels it first It SHIMMERS -- DRAWING FROM ALL THE
POWER IN THAT KISS The radiance spreads Up his arm
Brightening the AURA REKINDLING enveloping them BOTH
his clothes recrystallizing back into the uniform of

THE GREEN LANTERN

Recharged HalGL and Carol are so lost in their embrace
their kiss so long awaited they don’t even notice

THEYVE STOPPED FALLING

HalGL realizes He looks to his Ring which SHIMMERS

Carol opens her eyes And looks Exhilaration replacing
terror as she sees it -- she’s being carried by the GREEN
LANTERN BY HAL The pieces fall together Life changes

CAROL
(hits him)
Iknew it was you

HALGREEN LANTERN
Yeah right

He smiles taking soft hold of Carol and FLYING across
the sky

THE PRESIDENT is at the podium addressing a standing-room
only crowd of MEDIA

THE PRESIDENT
My fellow Americans The past days have
seen events so miraculous they shatter
every conception we have about

ourselves our world our place in
Creation We can look on these wonders
with fear or we can find hope A new

beginning To provide answers and to
quell anxieties I’d like to turn this
briefing over to Special Counsel to the
President Mr Alan Scott

A weathered older man steps to the podium A familiar face

And now a NAME

PIPE ALAN SCOTT
The President has given me the honor and
solemn responsibility of making this
announcement one I suspect will be long
remembered
(a beat then)
We are not alone in the universe

EXT COAST CITY PIER - DAY

THE LANTERNS use their Rings to repair the widespread damage

PEOPLE marvel at the sight of ALIENS on Earth Tomar-Re

For years now we’ve known of a group of
extraterrestrials who patrol our universe
and keep it safe

EXT TIMES SQUARE - NEW YORK - DAY
And we realize that we’ve caught up with our OPENING
ALAN SCOTT (ON ASTROVISION)
Impossible to imagine No more
impossible than when Columbus suggested
the earth was round or when Copernicus
posited that it orbited the sun
EXTINT OTHER CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD - THAT MOMENT
People stare at the impossible news projected there as well

There are heroes out there And now one
of our own has joined them One of us

Green Lantern walks with Scott down a long concrete hallway

GREEN LANTERN
Nice speech

ALAN SCOTT
Ive known about the people you work for
since I was younger than you Ever

since I’ve worked for the goverment
Helping them get ready for a day just
like this when this planet finds out
it’s just a tiny pebble on a very large
beach

(beat)
And people need to know it’1ll be okay
when you’re gone

GREEN LANTERN
I havent said I was going anywhere

Scott nods Eyeing the Ring with a bit of nostalgia

ALAN SCOTT
The Ring came to you so that’s your
decision to make But I’11 tell you
this If I could do what you can do
I wouldn’t stay here I’d fly around
this Universe seeing things no humans
ever seen No one who wears one of
those belongs to any one planet You
belong to the stars

GREEN LANTERN
(sensing re The Ring)
Youve worn it haven’t you

A long silence Then through the haze of smoke and memory --

ALAN SCOTT
One like it a lifetime ago
(a sad smile)
But it wasn’t mine to keep I wasn’t
chosen Not like you

Hal in uniform stands with Carol and Tom This is goodbye
Floating a few thousand feet up are Sinestro Tomar-Re and
OTHER LANTERNS Tom stares a little too much

TOM
You get to go off with them and I’m stuck
here I can’t even play games with
aliens now just seems like a rip off

GREEN LANTERN
I got a surprise for you

GL FIRES his ring into HANGAR 18 A RUMBLE and ABIN’S
SHIP RISES OUT The ship HOVERS on its own Fixed The
single greatest thing that ever happened to Tom

TOM
It’s flying I have a space ship That
flies Oh my god I can visit you --

Tom hugs GL hard enough to hurt Then makes way for
Carol Time for her goodbye Not an easy thing

GREEN LANTERN
(to Tom)
Can I get a minute

Tom moves to his hovering craft by the hangar The Lanterns
in the sky fly off even higher Into the upper atmosphere

GL de-uniforms suit shimmering back into clothes Just Hal

HAL
Do me a favor Give my family a good
excuse why I left --

CAROL
I will

HAL
(missing her already)
I could be gone awhile

CAROL
It’s okay I’ll be here Besides
you’re worth the wait

HAL
So are you

And her lips meet his in a kiss that shows an understanding
words can’t His Ring SHIMMERS with it The SHIMMERING

at the brilliant blue Earth Sinestro senses Hals sadness

SINESTRO
It is a beautiful planet

HAL

SINESTRO

If we train you well there will be a
thousand planets you will love just as
much
The promise of things to come Of Adventure Hal drinks in
the Earth One last look
HAL
Then let’s go see ‘em
And with a smile and an explosion of LIGHT
Two GREEN STREAKS PAINT The Blackest Night
And we end where we began
