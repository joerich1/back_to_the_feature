in a lot of ways one of which was to
-eut short my conversations with her
ewhanever I could My Mom says TI
started talking when I was only ten
menths old Not just words but real
sentences and stuff Almost § Like
conversations I never found out how
much of that was true and how much of
it was Mom I meanmost kids start
talkin’ when they get to be about
two But she had these tapes these
old cassettes and she would swear up
and down that that was me taikin’
with my father (A SHORT PAUSE) My
mother kept those cassettes like most
people keep photo albumswe could
always find one somewhere around the
housewhich is more than I could

that Hartwell was ebout to take up
full-time residence in my thoughts

dangerous but this had been my first
confrontation with arrogant racism I

just didn’t know where to look

INT FORRESTERS KITCHEN - DAY

FORRESTER DISBES UP a couple of BOWLS OF TOMATO
SOUP as GEOFFREY SITS at an old beat-up KITCHE
TABLE

FORRESTER
Dont let it get cold It gets that
filmy stuff on top

GEOFFREY
What stuff
PORRESTER
Just stir it
GEOFFREY
Ours never gets nuthin’ on it
FPORRESTER
anything on it You put milk in it
GEOFFREY
Youre sposed to put milk in tomato

soup

FORRESTER SITS and PULLS OUT some cigarettes

’

FORRESTER
Ive never done any interviews but If
gotta be honest I always kinda
wondered what the first question
might be (PAUSE) Whether milk goes
in tomato soup wasnt the one that

jumped to mind

GEOFFREY
S‘that mean I can ask you something

FORRESTER LIGHTS UF a CIGARETTE

YORRESTER
There something you need to know

GEOFFREY

Bow come you didnt write another

book

TORRESTER (EXSALES)
I dont think so (PAUSE) You should
have stayed with the soup question
The scup question was the perfect
question

GEOFFREY has no clue

TORRESTER (CONT)
The object of a question is or
should be to obtain information that
matters to us right Not to ask 4
question we think others would ask
or that others would be impressed we
thought to ask It‘s like those TV

‘ reporters they ask these piss-poor

questions and in the middle of one
of the piss-poor answers they get
the camera cuts back so I can see the
expression on the person who asked
the question Now if the question is
a decent one what I need to see is
the expression on the poor bastard

whes answering the question You

asked if milk goes into tomato soup
which was perfectly reasonable when
you consider that your mother was

“probably raised in a home that never

dreamed of wasting milk money on soup
when a can of water was just fine Do
you put milk in tomato soup Good
question In contrast to “why didnt
you write a second bookwhich
fails to meet the criteria of
ebtaining information that matters to
us It may matter to some critic who
needs to write a piece in tomorrows
paper so he can keep his sorry-ass
existence going but to yourather

worthless

FORRESTER takes another drag-

GEOFFREY
I dont know if I have any more soup
questions

YORRESTER
No (PAUSE) So whyd you come here

GEOFFREY hesitates

GEOFFREY
I wanted to give you

FORRESTER
«eowe went through this the other
day Simple question soup question
Whyd you come here

GEOFFREY
I wanted to see if you really hated

fay writing that much

The GREAT WRITER lets GEOFFREY stew a minute

FORRESTER
You ever started reading a bookand
found cut a few pages in that it
wasnt worth a shit

GEOFFREY
Yeah

FORRESTER
And what‘d you do

GEOFFREY —
Stopped readin’ it I guess

FORRESTER
You find any red ink on the last page
ef your notebook

GEOFFREY

FORRESTER

FORRESTER

But I never said anything

FORRESTER

Yeah you did Most people anymore
they talk but they don’t really say
anything I-go out there and within
ten minutes somebody I‘ve never seen

Truth is that person doesnt care
what kind of a day Im gonna have
The less you care about someone the
More you talk to ‘em The people we

care about most we dont talk to

Funny how it works isn‘t it

GEOFFREY
Can I ask you one more thing

TORRESTER GRINDS OUT his cigarette and locks up
at GEOFFREY

GEOFFREY
Whats it like

FORRESTER
What‘s what like

GEOFFREY
Writing a booklike you did

FORRESTER thinks for a moment before SAYING

FORRESTER
Maybe youll find out

“INT GEOPFREY’S BEOROOM - NIGHT

GEOFFREY SITS in front of his COMPUTER but there
is none of the familiar clacking sound on the

keyboard

ADULT GEOFFREY (VO)
It would be nice to say that I had an
unspoken understanding with Forrester
that I was not to tell anyone about
him But when it came to matters of
privacy Forrester wasnt into the
unspoken thing He made it clear that
if I told anyone anything I couldn’t
come back Which I actually took as
good news because it meant I could
come- back But it was right about
then -that it started happening
Whether it was because I suddenly had
Forrester reading my writing or
Crawford picking it apartI was
having a let of trouble putting two
sentences together

A break in the conversation as they MUNCH

CLAIRE
So who did write on your paper

GEOFFREY

more about writing than you do And a
person who knows that mich doesnt
work at a high school in Brooklyn

GEOFFREY doesn‘t know what to say wanting so
much to have someone to talk to about FORRESTER
yet not wanting to break his trust

What was surprising is that I started
putting down that line almost every
night that season And while I was
putting down that kind of line on the
court I was putting down very few
lines on the paper My success on the
court end lack of it off was
fueling what Barvey had always called
“the plan I not only bought into
it I invested in itseeing each of
those shots as a step toward money
that would change everything

A MURMOR from the crowd but it is quickly very
quiet again

FORRESTER
«eel decided this morning that TI
would come up here on this stage
because a very good friend of mine
wasnt allowed to (PAUSE) I have a
problem with these competitionsand
the reason for that is that they
suggest that if a student fails one
year that heor shecan learn
enough to maybe win the next year To
improve (PAUSE) I‘m sure some of
them some of you do improve At
least your professors probably tell
you that a8 a courtesy

A RIPPLE of LAUGETER from the STUDENTS

FORRESTER
But there are some writers a small
handful who cannot and should not
be taught how to write What they
should be allowed to dois write
And it is that select few that are
the real teachers 7

GEOFFREYS EMBARRASSED CRAWFORD not sure if hes
HUMILIATED or FURIOUS FORRESTER merely shifts
his attention to the PAPER BELOW

LIGHT RESPECTFUL APPLAUSE from the AUDIENCE The
BACK DOORWAYS are suddenly CROWDED with TEACHERS

Losing familyforces us to find our
family Not always the family that is
our bleed but the family that will

Life is how you anticipate it If we
could look back on our lives to read
the three or four sentences that
someone would acribble for the rest
‘ef us not to care about wed learn
that the most important events in our
livespass by without us even
knowing until years later Sometimes

the question how will I be
remembered by cthers° while never
stopping to think about how we would
remember it ourselves

The AUDIENCE is CAPTIVATEO GEOFFREY LOOKS UP in
wonder as MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SQUEEZE into the
back of the room

FORRESTER (CONT)
Tf life is indeed a game we learn
too late that it‘s a game that is not
won or lost it‘s a game that too
often simply is not played We search
for answers while never caring about
the questions

FORRESTER PAUSES

FORRESTER (CONT)

And near the end the only thing that
is left to say isI wish I had seen
that or I wish I had done that Or I
wish (PAUSE) And the wish is only a
hope that cannot be granted We end
our lives on a wish that can only be
handed on to another who will desire
the same Anticipation

The CROWD is too stunned to even move FORRESTER

softly FOLDS the PAPER
—
OD FORRESTER

I have never been much of a religious
man so if confession is indeed good
for the soulwell I’m about to
‘find out As some of you in this room
may know I have a reputation as
having lived a rather solitary life
and when I am written aboutthe
word author is usually preceded by a
variety of descriptions resentful
hostile bitter (LOOKS UP) I can
dispute none of thosebecause for
the most part it is a proper choice
of-words Its a decision that I made
on my own (PAUSE) and its a
decision I regret

FORRESTER STOPS for a second to take a breath and
gather his thoughts

FORRESTER (CONT)
Mest of you are too young to even
know what the wishes are yet But I
look at the words that read “and
near the end the wish is only a hope
that cannot be granted —

For the first time FORRESTERS rigid demeanor
cracks On the verge of TEARS he continues

FORRESTER (CONT )
oe-and I realize that the one wish
that was granted me so late in life
is the friendship of a remarkable
young man
