DARKNESS The soft rumble of a motor idling the only sound

MARCUS (VO)
I read a story once where a man
walked into hell and the only way
he could get out was by not lookin’
back when he left Turned out
temptation got the best of him and
he fucked it all up had to stay
there forever Well I was born in
hell and I11 tell you one fuckin’
thing When my time comes I
ain’t lookin’ back

We HEAR the KA-CHACK of a clip being jammed into a pistol and
on screen appears

SOUTH JAMAICA QUEENS NEW YORK

EXT CHECK CASHING STORE JAMAICA AVENUE - NIGHT

Late Quiet Run-down neighborhood A stolen Suburban
idles near a Check Cashing store lights on but gates down
closed for business PAN the Suburban‘s bumper-sticker “My
Child Was Student of the Month at Garden City Middle School”

INT CHEVY SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS

The occupants five African-American males and a Guest
In the driver’s seat is KERYL 23 Next to him sits ROMEO
18 who tokes on a huge spliff a Glock 9mm in his lap

KERYL

Romeo passes the joint to BAMA 23 Southern accent who
holds another 9mm -- In the back MARCUS their 25 year
old leader holds an Uzi In between him and TYRELL 22
sits RODRIGO a trembling Colombian about 30

Lets do this

As they all pull ski masks down over their faces

INT CHECK CASHING STORE NIGHT

A chain-smoking KOREAN MAN 50s sits at a table counting
Iachine WHIRRING as it spits out stacks of HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS Nearby two KOREAN WOMEN tie the stacks with bands

Across the room a Colombian GUARD watches a Tony Robbins
infomercial on TV A few beats then a coded knock on the
Side door RAP RAP RAP-RAP-RAP The Guard approaches the
peephole his 45 pistol still in its holster

GUARD’S POV THROUGH PEEPHOLE - Rodrigo stands outside holds
up a Nathans bag As he unlocks the door

GUARD
Fuck you been I‘m starvin’ in--

BAMMMM The door kicks in violently knocking the Guard
backward nearly off his feet The Korean Women SCREAM
throwing up their hands as Marcus and Co pile in

MARCUS
Fuckin’ move I‘ll blow your fuckin’
heads off

In a flash Bama is on the Guard 9mm jammed in his eye
He quickly takes the 45 forces the guy to his stomach as
Tyrell shoves Rodrigo to the floor next to him

While Romeo covers the Women Marcus produces a nylon duffel
bag Workmanlike as the Grinch but ten times faster he
fills it with the cash As he loads the money

KOREAN MAN
Goddamn cocksucker

TYRELL
Shut the fuck up
Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 091204 3

At the table Marcus cleans out the counting machine shoving
the bills into the duffel bag Bama nudges the Korean Man

BAMA

BAMA

MARCUS
I said let‘s--

Just then another Colombian GUARD appears in the front
doorway raises a sawed-off shotgun

KA-BLAMMM A huge hole is blown in the wall inches from
Bama‘s head With the Women screaming Bama holds his
shattered eardrum as Marcus sprays the Uzi at the Guard
taking him out Marcus shoves the duffel into Romeo’s hand

MARCUS
Got Got

As Romeo bolts off Tyrell covers the room while Marcus grabs
Bama carrying him out the door with one arm
EXT DARKENED STREET - NIGHT

duffel in Marcus rushes up holding Bama Tyrell following

KERYL MARCUS

MARCUS
Drive Gol Gol

As they screech off SIRENS blare in the distance and we
CUT TO

A CHERRY TOP LIGHT -- spinning wildly flashing in the dark
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal it’s on an AMBULANCE that
screeches down the Van Wyck Expressway On screen appears

INT AMBULANCE - NIGHT

MARCUS (V0)
I was born in 1976 same year as
the Bicentennial

Laying on the gurney is KATRINA 15 pretty African-American
and very pregnant she moans loudly in full labor Her
MOTHER 40s holds her hand as a PARAMEDIC checks her vitals

KATRINA
It hurts Ohhh Motherfucker

MOTHER

A cramped room Stevie Wonder and Charlie’s Angels (the TV

three SISTERS asleep nearby Katrina lays awake staring at
a mirrored disco ball hanging from the ceiling

MARCUS (V0O)

I never knew for sure who my pops
was - she never really talked about
him at all She always told me I
was the immaculate conception
Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 091204 5

Suddenly the disco ball starts glowing a bright other-
worldy light fills the room reflecting off Stevie Wonder’s
sunglasses It washes down over Charlies Angels alighting
Katrina’s face as she sits up in bed

MARCUS (V0O)
I guess I liked that better than
the truth which was probably that
he was some no-account nigga from
the hood

INT TACO BELL DAY
Katrina now 19 scoops meat into a row of taco shells

MARCUS (V0)
It didn’t really matter anyway -
with my moms around I didn‘t need
no dad See most girls her age
woulda gone on welfare let the
government pay their ass but
Katrina Philips wasn‘t about
that shit

INT TACO BELL - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

him a foil packet of coke As he pulls away Katrina heads
back to her spot on the corner sips a Sprite Further up
the block a hard-looking hustler well come to know as
TOPCAT 28 gives her a subtle nod

of the screen door of a small neatly-kept house

CAMERON‘S FATHER

Marcus watches as Cameron crosses the street and goes inside

MARCUS (VO)
Every night when that street light
came on it was time for Cameron to

plays with it a bit then after a while starts talking to it
Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 091204 13

As Kenneth tries to yank off Cameron’s jacket Marcus reaches
in his pocket He squeezes the plastic Soldier then
purposefully strides across the schoolyard onto the street

KID 2
Where you goin’ Marcus

MARCUS (V0O)
Growin’ up in the hood it’s a
constant battle to get nice things

Barely missing a step Marcus grabs a loose six-inch piece
of concrete from the sidewalk around a tree

MARCUS (V0O)
Its a bigger battle to keep ‘em

Marcus approaches Kenneth whose back is to him as he roughly
yanks off Cameron’s starter jacket

MARCUS
Hey

Kenneth turns and WHAMMMM Marcus SMASHES him across
the face with the concrete A gash immediately opens over
Kenneth’s eye blood pouring down his shirt as he goes down

MARCUS
Touch him again I will fuck your
ass up All you motherfuckers
Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 091204 14

Kenneth crawls to his feet runs off His gang suddenly gets
very quiet Marcus stares them down - no one has the balls
to challenge him He leads Cameron back to the schoolyard

Over the next few years I made
a reputation for myself with the
other kids And in the hood
reputation is the cornerstone

of power

world today

MARCUS (VO)
The difference was I took it
serious actually worked at it

EXT PUBLIC SCHOOL - SCHOOLYARD -

The same KIDS are gathered near Marcus who raps to a beat
He‘s colorful clever and very talented but way too hardcore
for a 5th grader with lyrics about crack murder and pussy

A TEACHER walks by on her way into the school overhearing
Marcus as he raps And on her appalled expression

MARCUS (V0)
But much as I liked rappin’ it
was sort of just a hobby -- nothin’
gave me a rush like makin’ money

Junebug empties a Glock into YANKEE CAPS body finishing
him off with three head shots As blood pools on the
sidewalk Junebug locks eyes with Marcus then jumps back

by the time I was 15 I had more
“reward” than I could hide

EXT GUY BREWER BOULEVARD - DAY

As Marcus Junebug and a few other Hustlers look on from down
