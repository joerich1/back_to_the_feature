PHIL

BUTLER public relations head JERRY SIMMONS
operations

director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel

Donovan taps his pencil impatiently obviously waiting
for

somebody

DONOVAN
(checking his watch)
Thirty minutes late Think shell

show

MATTHEWS
Shes got to Shes the damn owner
now

DONOVAN

She didnt last week She was having
a guava facial
As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is

the
conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE
SECRETARY -
BODYGUARD enters clearing the way for MRS RACHEL
PHELPS a
flashy striking woman in her early forties Despite
the
designer clothes she favors there is the hint of
something
less refined about her She carries a Pekinese dog
CHA-CHA
on her left hip
RACHEL
Good morning gentlemen Welcome to
another season of Indians baseball
The men applaud but their hearts are barely in it The
Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of
the

table and Rachel sits

RACHEL
I know that it may not seem the same
without Donald here this year but I
promise you by the end of the season
this team will have made history

Several eyes roll up around the room

RACHEL

(picking up a newspaper)
Unfortunately there are some in the
press who feel that

(reading from the

page)
the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps
has no business being the owner of a
major league baseball team

Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away

RACHEL

Obviously Donald didnt feel that
way or he wouldnt have left the

team to me And I was more than
showgirl I was a dancer Now I

know some of you have doubts about
my ability to run this franchise

God help you if I ever find out about
it

This causes a few nervous glances in the room

Donovan

RACHEL
Spring training begins in two weeks
(throwing a sheet of
paper on the table)
Heres the list of people well be
inviting to camp this year

Butler and Simmons pour over the list

RACHEL
I could sit here and tell you what a
great year were gonna have but the
facts are we lost the two best players
we had to free agency We havent
won a pennant in 30 years We havent
even finished in the first division
for 15 Obviously its time to make
some changes What do ya think

SIMMONS
I never heard of half these guys
And the ones I do know are way past
their prime

DONOVAN
Most of these guys never had a prime

BUTLER
(pointing to the sheet)
This guy here is dead

RACHEL
Cross him off then

BUTLER
(under his breath)
Lets not be hasty

RACHEL
Its time to shake things up Charlie
Clear the board and start over

DONOVAN
Well its not the best material
Ive ever had to work with but Ill
do my best to see we move up a notch
this year

RACHEL
I know you will Charlie Thats why
Im movin you up to General Manager
Congratulations

Rachel sticks out her hand Donovan shakes it somewhat

feebly
bewildered by this whole development
RACHEL
Well that should do it for today
Thank you gentlemen Lets get to
work
With that Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room
with
her entourage leaving Donovan and the others
dumbfounded

INT RACHELS OFFICE - DAY CONT
RACHEL
Come on in Charlie Have a seat

DONOVAN
Im glad you called me in Im still
unclear on a couple things

RACHEL
Oh really Like what

DONOVAN
Well if Im the GM whos gonna
be the Manager

RACHEL
I was thinking of Lou Brown

DONOVAN
Lou Brown

RACHEL
Hes managed the Toledo Mud Hens of
the International League for the
last 30 years

This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan

RACHEL
I think hell fit right in with our
team concept

DONOVAN
What exactly is our team concept

RACHEL
Thats what I wanted to talk to you
about I want to put together a team
that will help us relocate to Miami

DONOVAN
What do you mean
(referring to the
roster)
Some of these guys are furniture
movers

RACHEL
Im serious about this Charlie
Its no secret Ive never liked
Cleveland much The weathers lousy
downtown is a pit the stadiums
falling apart and we cant draw
dick Another couple of years of
this and Im gonna have to start
feeding Cha-Cha dog food

Rachel bends down to give her dog Cha-Cha a little
love
pat while Donovan tries to contain his disgust

DONOVAN
Mrs Phelps you cant just up and
move a team on a whim

RACHEL
Its hardly a whim Miamis offered
to build us a new stadium -- 62000
capacity 45 V1IP boxes and no
rent for the first million at the
gate Plus a 12 million dollar media
guarantee 45 percent of the
concession gross all of the parking
and they pick up the stadium
operations costs No other franchise
in baseball can match that deal

DONOVAN
Even so the Leaguell never let us
leave Cleveland We got a lease with
the city

RACHEL
The lease says we have the right to
move if our attendance falls below
800000 for the year
(pushing across a
copy of the lease)
Paragraph 40 line 17

Donovan looks at it the paragraph highlighted in
yellow

RACHEL
If we play bad enough we should be
able to come in under that

DONOVAN
What are you saying You want us to
lose

RACHEL

No weve been losing What I want
us to do is finish dead last

wrappers

Donovan is stunned He casts around helplessly for some
response

DONOVAN
Mister Phelps would never have
approved of this
RACHEL
He knew it had to be done He just
didnt have the courage to do it
(with veiled menace)
Hopefully you will come to see the
wisdom of it
(pause)

If this team lives up to its

potential we could have the worst

record in all baseball
On Donovans sunken face we go to

BROWN

Welcome to Spring Training gentlemen
Most managers tell you at this time
that all the jobs are open that
nobodys a lock at any position and
that talent isnt everything Theyd
rather see desire and discipline in
a player Then they tell you that
most of all they want you to have
fun out there even though theyre
gonna work your ass off on
fundamentals and condition you till
you drop The difference between me
and those other managers is

EXT THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY
The players are spread out on the field doing

TAYLOR
struggling through a series of pushups He glances over
disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano who are doing them
pistons in competition with each other Cerrano even
doing them one-handed
Hayes isnt doing them at all merely pulling his head

and down while leaving his body on the ground
HARRIS
Cmon Hayes lets do em right

HAYES

Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory
worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands
knocking dirt off his spikes twirling the bat etc A
sluggers routine

BROWN

Cmon Hayes this isnt the All
Star Game Get up to the damn plate

Hayes gets in and takes his stance On the first pitch
takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitchers
We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches Hayes
prodigious swings at all of them producing three more
ups none out of the infield Brown calls a halt

BROWN
Well you may run like Mays but you
hit like shit

HAYES
My strokell come back once I get
warmed up

TEMPLE
(referring to some
stats)
Never did get warmed up last year

You gotta stop swingin for the fences

The next pitch comes in Hayes swings and pops it up

HAYES
Shit

Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch
ball rockets an inch over Browns head and slams into
backstop
Brown stands frozen a second contemplating his brush

eternity then turns to Pepper

BROWN
Nice velocity
PEPPER
Sounded like it

TAYLOR
Sorry Lou I wasnt quite expectin
that much octane

Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man whos holding a speed
gun

BROWN

Better teach him some control before
he kills somebody

RODGER DORN

fielding grounders at third base He plays them off to
his

left side a bit almost as if hes afraid to get bit by
them

BROWN
Cmon Dorn get in front of the
damn ball

bullfighter)
Dont give me this ole bullshit

DORN
I took one of these in the eye last
year Nearly lost my sight

BROWN
Im deeply moved Every time you
play it off your hip you give me
forty sit-ups

DORN
What Thats Little League shit

BROWN
So is this

Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position like
Betty
Grable shying from a mouse Dorn burns
PEDRO CERRANO

in the batting cage knocking the cover off pitch after
pitch
with his black bat

BROWN
Jesus this guy hits a ton How come
nobody else picked up on him

TEMPLE
(to the batting
practice pitcher)
Okay Harris thats enough fast
balls Throw some curves

Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin curve ball
Cerrano
swings and misses it a foot

BROWN
Oh

Dorn approaches Brown at the cage

DORN
Lou I wanna have a word with you
here

BROWN
Sure

DORN

(whipping out his

contract)
Those penalty sit-ups you want me to
do I got it right here in my contract
that I dont have to do any
calisthenics I dont feel are
necessary What do ya think of that

Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what
theyre

doing to see how Brown will react Brown looks at the
contract

a second then drops it on the ground unzips his fly
and

gives it a golden shower On Dorns stunned face we

INT THE LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
Taylor Hayes and Vaughn drag in looking beat from the
days
workout
TAYLOR
Shit the way I played today I
wouldnt be surprised if they red-
tagged me already
HAYES
What do ya mean
TAYLOR
Red tag in your locker means the
manager wants to see you cause you
just died and went to the minors
Vaughns hand freezes on his locker latch afraid to
open it
now
TAYLOR
Dont worry they dont cut anybody
the first day
Vaughn is still not so sure He sits down on his locker
stool
and glances over toward STEVE HARRIS a starting
pitcher

whose locker is adjacent As Harris takes off his

inside the button line

VAUGHN
What is that stuff

HARRIS
(pointing to them in
order)
Crisco Bardahl Vagisil Any one of
em will give you another 2-3 inches
drop on your curve ball

Vaughn cant believe this

HARRIS
Course if its cold and I got a shirt
on under my jersey I just ruba
little jalapeno inside my nose and
get it runnin I need to load up
the ball a little I just wipe my
nose

VAUGHN
(revolted)
You put snot on the ball
HARRIS
At my age you put anything you can
find on it I havent got an arm
like yours
Vaughn just looks at him incredulous
TAYLOR AND CARRANO
Taylor is undressing but his attention is diverted by
whose stall is right next to him Cerrano has set up an

in his locker In front of his bats which are lined up

sentinels is a table covered with pictures of baseball
players figurines of saints several lit candles and

the middle a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its

Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats He
an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish
doll

TAYLOR
What are you doin there Pedro

CERRANO
Bats They are sick

TAYLOR
So are mine Is somethin goin

CERRANO
No hit curve ball Straight ball
hit it very much Curve ball bats
are afraid I ask Jo-Buu to come
Take fear from bats

HAYES
Jo-Buu

TAYLOR
Maybe hes the pagan saint of
baseball

CERRANO
I offer him cigars and gin He will
come

Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next
to

the fetish doll Harris has been listening to all this

Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers

HARRIS
I wouldnt leave this gin sittin
around out here with this group

CERRANO
(with a certain gravity)
Is very bad to steal Jo-Buus gin
Is very bad

Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers

Thats bad but not bad enough

DONOVAN
Projected over the whole season we
stand to wind up 36 games under 500
and 28 out of first That should be
bad enough for anybody

RACHEL
We finished 24 out last year and
still drew 890000 When schools
out for the summer attendance is
liable to rise Plus this team is
showing signs of improvement I didnt
think wed win 15 games all year

Any ideas

DONOVAN
On how we can get worse
(sarcastic)
How about a series of fines for good
play Maybe a 30000 bonus to the
guy chosen Least Valuable Player

RACHEL

but its a long expensive process

BROWN
How am I supposed to keep my players
healthy with cold water and no therapy

RACHEL
Your players will just have to get a
little tougher What are they a
bunch of pansies

Immediately 30 arms shoot up behind her in the Italian
up-

yours gesture She turns around but by then the
players

have quickly returned to normal positions

BROWN
Over 162 games even tough guys get
sprains sore arms muscle pulls
RACHEL

Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area
deserted this time of night She wears a racing suit

lets her hair hang free The pool glows like a sheet of
emerald glass She shakes down a beat curls her toes

the coping slowly bends at the waist and then

into a full-out racing dive

We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley
the butterfly then the backstroke breaststroke and
freestyle We condense the time of course SHOOTING
underwater some SLO-MO as she knives through the
her hair flowing behind her an athlete alone with her
The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her
and her athletic ability but the fluid beauty of

its synthesis of power and form

As she begins the freestyle leg another body appears
pool next to her Its Jake and hes racing her the

lap She immediately responds to the challenge digging
harder picking up her kick They go neck and neck for

yards but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by
body length at the wall Both are winded

TAYLOR
You still got that great kick Just
like the first time I ever saw you

LYNN
You follow me here too

TAYLOR
Yeh what did you want to see me
about

The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland
suffice it to say by the end of the chase she appears
have ditched him

EXT LYNNS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lynn comes up the stairs unlocks the apartment door
steps inside Theres no particular urgency She feels
shes shaken Taylor

The apartment is full of packing boxes Tired from the

Seeing nothing she turns away from the window

Hello Lou what can I do for ya
Lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk

BROWN
I wanted to hand in my resignation
before you had a chance to fire me

RACHEL
What do you mean

BROWN
I know what you been tryin to do
with this team After the season I
want no part of it

RACHEL
Well I knew I could count on Charlie
to tell somebody I was just afraid
he might take too long

BROWN
Why would you want him to tell
somebody

RACHEL

So youd tell the team hopefully
getting them mad enough to knock
themselves out trying to prove they
belonged in this league I think it
worked

BROWN
You tryin to make me believe you
wanted us to win all along

Rachel nods

BROWN
Bullshit What about the plane the
bus the bad hotels

RACHEL
We were broke We couldnt afford
anything better Donald left the
team nearly bankrupt If wed had
another losing season I would have
had to sell the team I knew we
couldnt win with the team we had
so I decided to bring in new players
and see how theyd do with the proper
motivation There was never any offer
from Miami I made it all up

BROWN
Why should I believe any of this
Now that were winnin its easy for
you to jump on the bandwagon

RACHEL
If Id really wanted you to lose
all I had to do was send the best
players back to the minors But I
didnt did I

Brown has no comeback for this He knows now that shes
telling the truth

RACHEL
You think this was all an accident
I personally scouted every member of
this team except Hayes of course
He was a surprise They all had flaws
which concealed their real talent
or I wouldnt have been able to get
