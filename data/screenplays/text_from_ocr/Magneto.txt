CLOSE ON DRESS SHOES

Setting a steady if muddy course as we PAN UP to see the
man we know as MAGNETO A multitude of contradictions

Old And vibrant

Elegant And angry

Brilliant And base

CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE MAGNETO (HAND-HELD)

His trademark hat coat and swagger on display he remains
unaffected by virtually oblivious to the rainfall

And he stops in front of a 14 foot-tall GATE Rickety and
full of rust its less than formidable

But to Magneto its ghastly

He stares at it lids fluttering like the wings of a
hummingbird assaulted by memory

He pulls Erik closer - close enough to kiss - as tears streak
down the boys cheeks SOBBING in spite of himself

And only now do we see the hermetic gloves on his hands and

Tough to tell how much time has passed but his hairs longer

to discern what lurks in the other rooms along the periphery

We however cant look away

We settle on one of the many long tables where we find ERIK
staring at his reflection off the green gruel (POV) The face
that looks back is even more anemic Nearly skeletal

He doesnt touch the SPOON to the left of his bowl Glancing
up to meet inadvertent eyes with a GYPSY GIRL about his age

before Its slid a foot across the table

listens to the hushed conversation beside him

watching with the wounded eyes of a widow or a war veteran

His gaze goes to an‘OLD MAN whos propped up against a barren
brick wall beside others The prelude to an execution

A sinewy SS officer of obvious import orders an UNDERLING to
dispose of the helpless prisoners His name is HANS DECKER

in paindropping the daggerclutching madly at his skull

And we see the helmet TIGHTEN around his headleaving him
no choice but to yank it off toss it to the dirt

The helmets visibly bent

suspicious sneers as we angle towards

Where a rowdy band of fishermen congregate as ERIK sidles up
to the bartender

ERIK
Id like to get something to eat
please

The bartender waves him off shooing him towards the dining
section of the pub

And Erik glances down the bar to see several townsmen staring
at him He nods affably back

They dont reciprocate

And hes about to look for a table when he catches inadvertent
sight of a LOUD MAN at the end of the bar Clearly
inebriated theres something familiar about him

CLOSE ON ERIK

An epiphany in his eyes as he spots the prominent SCAR on
the mans xight cheek realizing

ITS KIRKEN

The guard last seen abusing a prisoner in Auschwitz

Only air and opportunity separating us from Kirken

ERIK

Moves closer trying to elicit a glance Still not wanting
to believe its him not wanting to believe this mans free

But a glimpse of those icepick eyes of that coarse skin
and theres no doubt who this is

Feeling eyes upon him Kirken looks at Erik nodding before
he drains another mug of ale

But Erik cant look away eyes unblinking Not so much
searing asstunned So once again -Kirken turns back

KIRKEN ‘

Can I help you my friend
Erik cant speak Cant breathe Can barely move
Kirken smirks Shrugs Motions the bartender for another
KIRKEN (CONTD)

English)
You speak English
Erik nods his chest swelling with each labored breath
And Kirken looks at ERIKS HAND on the counter it shakes

He says something in Russian(we dont translate)to the bar
flies eliciting LAUGHTER at Eriks expense

Then finally a voice culled from deep in Briks belly

ERIK
Youre German

Look closely and youll see a wrinkle flex across ‘Kirkens
forehead Replaced by a reflexive - -

KIRKEN
Im Russian A citizen Born and
raised Do not bother me boy
But Erik stays trembling with fear Or is that rage

And then emboldened Erik peels his right sleeve up
Revealing the NUMBER tattooed there

And Kirken looks at it And looks at Erik And smiles

English)
Not too late to finish what we
started boy
(raises glass in toast)
Well get to you soon enough

Frik towels his face off hand and voice atremble

ERIK
You have to pay for what youve done

Kirken peels back the fold of his coat exposing the PISTOL
tucked beneath his belt

KIRKEN
Maybe Ill get to you now -

Without warning he whacks the mug across Eriks face
shattering it as Brik stumbles back

No one blinks No one helps Many CHUCKLE
KIRKEN
Guffaws loudest of all hauling Erik to his feet Lifting
the lighter lad fistfuls of his shirt in- his grip as he
leans closer And growls
KIRKEN (CONTD)
You think we went away Were

He plugs the pistol underneath Eriks chin Hammer cocked
and ready for recoil

No one seems the least bit disturbed by any of this

But over Kirken’s shoulder we notice something else A STEAK
KNIFE At a nearby table MOVING

Rising on its own ostensible accordcoming closer

KIRKEN (CONTD)
The Fourth Reic - -

His words expire a tiny trickle of blood gurgling from his
mouth before THE CAMERA CIRCLES to show that steak knife

In Kirkens back

He unhands Erik wobbling left to right the gun CLATTERING

A gorgeous sight rendered grotesque

And only now apart from it all does Erik see (POV) the
commotion in the village

The prelude to a lynch mob
’ Appropriately inspired he moves towards it
FRIK POV Women and children scatter upon sight of us

Treated to whispers as we pass (warlockthe devil
himselfsome kind of sorcery)

A sea of eyes peek from behind biinds nothing heard but the
sound of doors being locked A chorus of CLACKS

ERIK

Looks ahead dark plumes of smoke ascendant

It quickens Eriks pulse

And his pace

Emboldened by thought and possibility he walks
He jogs

HE RUNS (HAND-HELD)

Heart pounding he moves towards the conflagration Scaling
a modest incline given full view of

HIS HOME

In flames A MOB of men amassed around it thrusting torches
and fists in the air Articulating the night with fire and
venom Trying to drive the demons out

But in a world of fight or flight Eriks all fight as he
runs TOWARDS the burning building the SCREAMS of his family
heard from inside

THE MOB

Thwart his path several FISHERMEN pouncing on him wrestling
him to the dirt

And still inside the house we hear the SCREAMS of Anya and
Magda through the CRACKLING flames

Anyas TEDDY BEAR sits abandoned on the front mat

Inspired Erik rises awkwardly to his feet gaze on a busted
POLE collapsed in the dirt

CLOSE ON ERIKS EYES

Alternately intense And ENRAGED

CLOSE ON THE BROKEN POLE
As it begins to rattle and shake As if possessed
THE RINGLEADER

A fire-hydrant with feet raises his bat to pummel Erik just
as we notice something odd” And not so odd

That metal pole AIRBORNE Approaching like a missile
Heading right for the ringleaders head THUNK

And the thug relinquishes his grip on the bat felled to the
dirt floor Unconscious Or worse

And upon sight of this sorcery the mob moves collectively
back Terrified

And Erik sprints towards the FIRE about to enter when - -

THE ENTIRE EDIFICE COLLAPSES

The columns crumbling with a show of sparks before Erik can
get to his beloved wife arid daughter

A burst of flames shoot out sending Erik back stumbling to
the dirt as he emits a pained HOWL

His wife and daughter scream no more

And now his face caked with soot and sweat a virtual mask
Erik resembles the demon they believe him to be

And he staggers across the soil halting to behold the
tattered remnants of his homeof his life

And the professor looks at Erik appraising Finally
NOAH WESENTHEIN
I cant help you Im sorry Hunting

Youll get yourself killed -

Erik nods - justas the professors plate of pasta plunges
into his lap Shit

mutters an “excuse mé and scampers into the next room(os)

But ERIK has other concerns Dark specs ‘and thin-coat donned
he occupies an outdoor table

Sipping iced coffee Sweating profusely

But despite the newspaper in his hand his gaze drifts across
the street To A BANK(POV)

And then back to that paper Or whats beneath it A

ON THE PHOTO A stern German man named Otto Reiner

Slides the photo aside Enabling us to see ANOTHER PHOTO

And Erik compares the two photos little doubt that this is

the same man Thinner hair Thicker waist Same grin

And only now do we notice THE HANDSOME MAN seated a few tables
down Buzz cut he studies Erik - whos oblivious to him

After a moment with a deep breath Erik stands Digs deep
in his pockets Comes up short

He leaves a few shillings on the table marching across the

Stalks closer on the carpet now eyes on

Uncluttéred our gaze goes to A COFFEE MUG

VOICE (0S)

Erik nearly jumps Startled to see
THE BANKER

Inches away That smile even more effusive up close

THE BANKER
You seem a bit lost

Eriks at a loss for words Stammering

THE BANKER (CONTD)
Are you new to our city

ERIK
Yes No

THE BANKER
(a laugh)
Well whichever it is if theres
anything you need my names John

He extends a hand that Erik tentatively shakes Watching as
the banker moves toward the back vaults

Frik focuses back on that desk And the COFFEE MUG atop it
A SECURITY GUARD circles close by

Erik sweeps the scene waiting for the guard to turn away
making sure customers are sufficiently occupied before

That coffee cup Rises And FLOATS through the air An
intoxicating moment for Erik the mug goes right into his
hand But then Erik sees - -

THE LITTLE GIRL

Staring at him Having witnessed the whole thing

The sight of her conjures memories of his beloved Anya

Erik puts a finger to his lips Shhhh And he winks with a
smile that never reaches his eyes

The little girl nods back accepting the tacit terms of their
contract Their little secret

But as Erik exits we notice that someone else has seen the

EXT CLUB - STREET - - NIGHT

HARD CUT TO

BAM A back door slaps open the banker and a lovely lass

spilling out Fully inebriated

And after a brief and graceless wrestling match the lass
wisely breaks free and stumbles off on her own

Leaving the banker behind Shouting drunkenly after her

And after a moment he forces perfect posture before ambling

down the vacant alley

Heeding nothing but the faint sound ofrolling THUNDER Ears attuned the banker squints down Spots the source of
the sound A small BALL BEARING Rolling towards him

The size of a large marble it halts at his

feet

And the banker peers down at it giggling like a school girl

Squatting for a closer look

ANGLE ON BALL BEARING

Its shiny surface enabling us to see the bankers bemused

expression He sees something else too
ERIK (BANKER POV)

Or so he thinks But when he turns around
there Sobering up the banker reaches for

On a flat surface the marbles behavior is
unscientific Subversive even

And the bankers certain hes seeing things

theres no one

Or beckoning

Questioning

his sanity buthe follows that steel ball

Bround a corner Where he runs right into - -

Standing in his path arms akimbo something concealed behind

But the banker makes no immediate connection between the

marble and Erik exasperated when he blurts

A fact that places even more suspicion on Erik the Marines

The Marines flex their firearms to enforce the point

And Erik shrugs And sighs And concedes

And we watch as those shackles peel slowly off on their own
To the ‘utter amazement of everyone

The ultimate distraction the rest happens fast

pistol from Marine 1s grip before

Erik kicks the gun from Marine 2s hand leaving him to
contend with a recent arrival well cleverly call Marine

Erik complies letting the bar CLANG to the carpet Right
before sucking the GUN from Marine 3s grip

The Marine stares at his empty appendage eyes agog
Not sure what else to do he RUNS

And remember that embassy official Hes not so calm anymore
cowering in a corner petrified

Erik looks to the staircase — where reinforcements flood
into view carrying M-1 machine guns and bad intentions

EXT ESTATE - -EAST SIDE - - NIGHT

The Nazis aborted scream has garnered the attention of THREE
of his comrades - who scamper into the house moving past - —

ERIK
Who ducks behind a stack of tires staring at the grounds

Only the full moon provides any source of light That and
the car BEAMS bouncing off the STABLE

From which we see TWO SOLDIERS transporting boxes towards
TWO JEEPS idling on the grass

ERIK

Slinks closer taking refuge behind a rustridden TRACTOR
Pondering options before his eyes fall on the alpha male
directing the action

DECKER

Time doing little to quell his penchant for tyranny

ERIK POV ANOTHER SOLDIER hauls a BOX of GRENADES towards
one of the jeeps carefully placing it in the back

One thing clear These men are assembling an arsenal

Then as if mesmerized Erik steps into the open moving
brazenly towards Decker i

The THREE SOLDIERS notice from behind Shouting HALT
And Decker turns to face Erik Mere feet away

And there they stand amidst the confusion rifle barrels
fixed on Eriks back (he seems less than concerned)

ERIK
You dont remember me

Decker calmly removes his sidearm Checks the ammo

DECKER
Dont trust Ill need to

Full of calm void of contrition he lifts said firearm as
some thirty yards away

A HAND GRENADE

Tumbles errantly from the back of the Jeep like a tomato

ERIK
Tell me what I amtell me what you
did to’me
That hand grenade Rolls closer to the soldiers
DECKER
Id rather show you what Im going
to do to you

Erik closes his eyes Keeps them there As if accepting
his fate Or expediting that of others And we hear a -

PLINK (OS)

The faint but indelible sound produced when a pins removed
from a grenade Invariably followed by a -

BOOOCOCCOOM

Sending shrapnel towards the soldiers behind Erik knocking
them to the dirt wounded and debilitated

DECKER

Shields himself from the explosion the Jeep launched into
the air before thundering back like a deflated tennis ball

Gradually activating each and every grenade in that box

A succession of EXPLOSIONS illuminate the night sending
everything into disarray Its as if the compounds under
attack Nazis firing at unseen enemies

ERIK

Uses the pandemonium to his advantage punching out the Nazi
whosapproaching from behind Delivering a debilitating
kick to anothers knee

He dislodges their firearms with a flick of his head

But Erik loses sight of Decker scouring the grounds for his
adversary when he feels

A NAZI

Blitzing him from behind nary a second to react whirling
to see THE GLINT OF A SWORD - -

- THAT DAGGER — -

- - INTO THE NAZIS BELLY — -

And theres nothing mystical about this murder blood bubbling
from the soldiers mouth as he blinks at Erik before
collapsing to the dirt DEAD

Erik looks at the body Looks at his bloody hands The
first murder hes intended to commit it gives him no joy

And he stares down for what feels like an eternity until

DECKER (0S) (CONTD)
I remember you now

full of steel And Erik tries to turn but - -

BLAM Hes blown back

ANOTHER EXPLOSION
Rocks the compound jeep debris reigning down

ERIK

Claws his way towards a water well as the stable doors slap
open HORSES scurrying out only adding to the chaos

The thoroughbreds dash in circles caught in the frenzy

HEAR the rumble of the remaining Jeep engine before we see
Nazis driving off ‘

And we HEAR the THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of helicopter blades
Erik looking up to see a CHOPPER given flight

and hardas Erik tries wounded hes unable to manipulate
metal his powers diminished

And hes left to watch clutching his gunshot shoulder as
the CHOPPER soars into the sky

INT CHOPPER - - IN FLIGHT
Decker looks down through the canopy at the wounded Erik

Erik stares back

EXT ESTATE - - BACKSIDE - - NIGHT

Erik staggers to his feet watching the helicopter recede
before surveying the scene the detritus of his deed

A field of flames

And Erik catches his breath as one of those errant HORSES
trots towards him

Erik reigns it in Pats its mane Calming the beast

An odd contrast to the violence weve just witnessed theres
a paradoxical tenderness to this man

ERIK
Shhh Its okaytheyre all gone

But he stops when he looks at the horses face

And sees one of its EYES is a synthetic shade of BLUE

subterranean confines coming into view revealing

And Charles exhausted from the journey into Eriks mind
barely musters the strength to nod

And more dangerous

Charles gathers himself perhaps avoiding the inevitable
question yet to come

From inside embalmed in darkness the double doors creak
open a shard of moonlight articulating

ERIK
In the doorway Inhaling a deep breath before stepping inside
the cavernous confines Consistent with any other farmhouse

Stalls Sawdust Barrels

ERIK POV Only look closer The stalls are empty not an
animal in sight

And those barrels cant help but conjure memories of Zyklon
B ‘the favored chemical used for Auschwitz exterminations

ERIK

Walks through no sign of the promised laboratory No sign
of humanity save the faint din of voices (os)

Growing louder Coming closer

He halts above a pile of sawdust his foot feeling around
the surface Stomping until a dull THUD calis back

His boot brushes sawdust aside to reveal STEEL DOORS on the
floor Sound beckons from within

And Erik strains to lift the doors peeking in to see a dark
dungeon-like lair below An inscrutable abyss

He descends steps

The darkness ceding to light BRIGHT LIGHT Where we find
a world unto itself A bunker like youve never seen

Erik creaks a door open to behold a spartan bunker

He enters cautiously tosee the rooms vacant save a few

step from the shadows

A disembodied and aurally enhanced voice follows

Erik makes a run at Twin 2 his fist caught in the larger

Walks calmly closer his breath visible in the night air as
a flicker of flames spurt from under the Mercedes hood

And Erik stops beside the car the heat on his skin

He looks inside the battered clump to see Kleinmein head
slumped on the steering wheel The crumpled car trapping
his body awkwardly inside

If not dead then close to it

Nothing heard but the continuous BLARE ofthe car horn

For Erik its the moment that separates forgiveness from
fury redemption from rage

He just stares at Kléinmein watching indifferently as FLAMES
spread from the car engine

Only now does Kleinmein rouse into consciousness

Erik sees the BLUE VIAL in Kleinmeins left hand reaching
over his hand on top of Kleinmeins

But not to comfortto squeeze

further expands from the front of the car
