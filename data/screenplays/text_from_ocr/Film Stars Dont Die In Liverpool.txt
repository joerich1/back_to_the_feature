transforms warming her vocal chords as she goes

did not wear socks whilst
trying on the shoes Both for
Madam’s fit and for the sake
of the shoes

GLORIA

(posh English)
Oh does one indeed Well Madam
doesn’t agree

(Hollywood accent)
I always wear socks It’s my
constitutional right to wear my
socks

Her father’s line descends from
John of Gaunt Duke of

Shakespearean one-

(collects herself)
“This royal throne of kings
This sceptered Isle This earth
of majesty This seat of Mars
This other Eden demi
Paradise

Peter about to clap when--

MOTHER
‘The Bard’ has always been
close to my heart from the
first time I played Ophelia

MOTHER
She was just as good an actress
as the other blonde you know

PETER

Peter Finally he gets up

PETER

Think what you wanna think

PETER
(beat)
I think It doesn’t matter

palmers too

Ay pilgrim lips that they
must use in prayer

do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest
faith turn to despair

her throat Peter unsure what to do - whether to go
over - call it a day But then--

JULIETGLORIA
Saints do not move though
grant for prayers sake

Peter smiles with pride at his ‘gal’

prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by yours my
sin is purged

EXT LIVERPOOL ROAD - AT THE SAME TIME - DAWN

a white fox fur on her shoulders a tragic goddess
from the ‘Silver Screen’
