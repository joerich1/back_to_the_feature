EXT CAB ON MARINE DRIVE - EVENING (DVFOOTAGE)

A digital camera is on in a cab which is stuck in
traffic inching its way along Marine Drive in the rain
Music plays on the cabbie’s radio and there is angry
honking from impatient drivers

The cabbie looks at the person who is filming in the back
seat through the rear view mirror He is a portly man
with greying hair and kind lines around his eyes

CABBIE
Nayi aayi hain mumbai mein

GIRL (0OC)
Ji paanch mahine ho gaye Phir bhi sab
naya hi lagta hai

CABBIE
Kahan ki hain aap

GIRL (0OC)
Malihabad UP

CABBIE
Accha Main bhi UP ka hoon Jaunpur
Jaunpur jaanti hain aap

GIRL (0OC)
Haan Ja chuke hain vahan

Cabbie nods looking pleased The camera pans to the
window and the girl opens it letting a spray of water
onto the lens She shoots the street pedestrians with
umbrellas trying to cross the road between cars the
churning grey sea The camera work is amateur We catch a
glimpse of the girl in the rear view not enough to see
her clearly

They pass Girgaum Chowpatty

GIRL (OC) (CONT’D)

(into camera mike ina

whispered voice)
Dekho Imran yehi voh mashoor Chowpatty
hai Marine Drive par Har din yahan bohot
log aate hain - bhel puri khane pav
bhaji khane Mere khayal mein zyadatar
log yahan ki khuli hawa khane aate hain
jiski badi kami mehsoos hoti hai (pause)
Samundar ki hawa kitni alag hai Lagta
hai isme logon ke armaanon ki mehek mili
hui hai
Some street kid comes up to her at the street light

STREET KID
(sadly)
Didi do rupya do na roti khayega

He notices the camera

STREET KID (CONT’D)
Arre tum shooting kar rah hai
(shouts to the others)
Eh Raju
(to her)
Mera bhi photo lo na didi “Pardesi
pardesi jaana nahin mujhe chhod ke”

The cabs pulls away as the kid continues to dance in the
rain while the other kids join him

TITLES OVER THE FOLLOWING SCENE

EXT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - EVENING

A bunch of construction workers work on the fourteenth or
fifteenth floor of what is on its way to becoming a
mammoth building They look thin poorly clad and poorly
equipped - few helmets no harnesses just one or two
with scruffy caps at jaunty angles

Crows and kites fly and perch as down below traffic
snarls its way slowly around Bombay’s congested roads at
home-going rush hour

One of the workers Selva squats near an edge to light a
bidi He finds he doesn’t have a light and asks a co-
worker in Telugu for matches He is tossed a light as
the guys all share a joke He lights his bidi and looks
out over Bombay The highrises all around the sea in the
distance the small pathetic clusters of the
construction workers children as they play in the rubble
The sun is setting

INT A FLAT - SUNSET

Arun and his broker Rakesh open the door of a disused
apartment Arun is around 35 a thoughtful looking man
attractive in a bookish serious sort of way Rakesh
tries a couple of light switches but nothing comes on
There’s a little light from the fading sun
Rakesh a weasly 23 year old umbilically attached to his
cell phone tries to push open a window which is firmly
stuck while talking into his phone cradled between his
ear and shoulder

RAKESH
Nahin nahin madam bohot accha hai
exactly aapke layak haan hai gas
connection hai day-night security hai
ab aaj ke zamane mein phone kisko

chahiye haan pani hai mostly subah ko
to zaroor hai aap dekh to lijiye
madam Bohot accha hai ok chhe baje
Ok madam

He has the window open and he turns around expectantly

RAKESH (CONT’D)
To kaisi lagi Arun ji

Arun looks around him and wanders round the room

RAKESH (CONT’D)
Arre perfect hai Thodi si painting aur
ye bilkul nayi lagegi Aap to painter
hai aapko idea hogi hain

Arun gives him a look to say stop bullshitting me

RAKESH (CONT’D)
Nahin soch lijiye yahan vo gyarah
mahine ka chakkar nahin rahega unlimited
lease aur yeh hai vo “bombay view” jo
aapko chahiye tha Vo dekhiye vo hai Aga
Khan ka tower Station nazdeek hai aur
toilet attached hai jo is type ke
building mein normally nahin rehta hai
Haan kitchen small hai par aap kahan
khana banate hain

Rakesh’s phone rings and he answers it while Arun looks
out at the view There are old buildings all round in
stages of disrepair The street below is busy and there
is a neon hoarding on the terrace of the opposite
building

As they leave Arun sees a lady sitting outside her flat
on a chair with an unseeing expression on her face
INT SALIM’S SLUM ROOM - NIGHT

Salim and Munna are watching a David Dhawan
comedy on tv smoking cigarettes and drinking rum
While Salim is an overweight affable sort Munna is a
good looking smart boy with a twinkle in his eye anda
sense of style Salim’s mother also watches in
between sealing little packets of fancy rubber bands
Salim’s younger brother Karim is studying from a
text book Much laughter We can hear trains in the
background

SALIM
Behnchod yeh hasa hasa ke maar dalega
saala Dekh dekh

MUNNA
Yaar kya actor hai yaar Main usse
milna chahta hoon

SALIM
Johnny Lever se Chal main milvata hoon

MUNNA

KARIM

Amma jab main exam mein fail ho gaya na

MUNNA
(mock serious)
Theek kaha Salim chup kar na yaar
Paanchvi fail Tu dekh saale apna Karim
padh likh kar ekdum top class gentleman
banega maloom kya Hai na Karim Eh
Karim bol na Correct na

Karim gives him a glare Munna gets up to go with a grin
and wink

SALIM
Kidhar ko nikla Kaam pe Tera yeh kaam
itna ghatiya hai na kayko karta hai
Munna Main bola na main setting kar ke
deta hun tujhe

MUNNA
Tere jaisa kaam nahi karna hai Chor
saala Mera hi kaam accha hai kyun
khala

He brandishes a heavy stick with a metal tip at the end
grinning Khala doesn’t react she’s used to this kind of
banter Munna playfully pokes his stick in Salim’s ribs
and Salim throws it off
SALIM
Chhi Hut saale

Munna leaves grinning

EXT SLUM ON THE RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT

Munna crosses the rail tracks

EXT MAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Munna darts across the road and a car swerves to avoid
him causing a little confusion Munna continues to walk
and the driver swears under his breath We cut inside the
car to Shai 29 very attractive and stylish and Pesi The windows are up and Shirley Bassey is on the
stereo

SHAT
Shit What did he think he was doing
Crazy

PESI

Shai don’t act the NRI now huh You’ve
forgotten traffic here or what

SHAT
And we are so late Pesi My mum left for
the show an hour ago

PESI
Babe nothing remotely interesting in
Bombay starts before ten darling Now I
really need to educate you in Bombay
etiquette

Shai rolls her eyes in a good humoured way

INT ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Its a modest sized interesting gallery opening the new
works of T Arun paintings etchings and some small
installations Well heeled so-called art lovers mingle
as wine champagne and hors d’oeuvres do the rounds
Press photographers take pictures Shai is being
introduced to some people by her mother Pravin while
Pesi talks to a serious looking man Later Shai looks at
the works
The installations which have an Escher-esque
construction about them are made from what seems like
scrap and waste materials Shai looks around a bit
fidgety observing all the different kinds of people
there Arun walks in She sees him and keeps looking at
him finding him attractive

PESI
Oh there’s Arun Finally He can’t even
make it in time for his own show
Actually I like this new work what do
you think Jatin

Jatin carefully weighing his words

JATIN
Well its hard to be apolitical when
you’re referencing the working classes
because the discourse goes into areas of
ethics I think this has a specificity
which belies its larger context really

Pesi nods thinking hard what he should say

SHAT
Which one is Arun

Pesi points him out She looks at him and widens her eyes
meaningfully Pesi returns the look first quizzical then
catching on

Vatsala calls everyone to attention

VATSALA

Ladies and gentlemen the artist has
decided to make an appearance

(claps all round some

comments and laughter)
I take great pleasure in presenting
“building” Arun’s new work I don’t
really need to formally introduce Arun
do I

(more comments and laughs)
Well the ignorant can read my expensive
brochure Now is the moment Arun hates
the most Arun come and say a few words
Everyone T Arun Arun be nice

(much clapping)

Arun steps up and looks at the crowd
ARUN
Well there’s not much to say I think
This is my most transparent work Its my
tribute to the people from Rajasthan
Tamil Nadu Bihar UP and elsewhere who
build this city in the hope that someday
they will find a rightful place in it
So to Bombay my muse my whore my
beloved

He raises his glass as a toast the crowd raises their
glasses in a ‘salut’ and Arun knocks back his drink and
hurries into the crowd Then there’s clapping and
bravo’s

Shai and Pesi also clap and the party is resumed Pesi
looks about him animatedly as if for a victim

PESI
There’s Feroz Bastard owes me five
lakhs

SHAT

Babe he’s beautiful

PESI
Who Feroz He’s not in the Oh him
(following her gaze to Arun)
He’s strange Too deep and dark for me
baba

SHAT
Thank god for that At least one boy in
Bombay is available then

Elsewhere Arun has been cornered by a lady in big
diamonds

LADY DIAMONDS
Ha ha You know But tell me do you
think you’ll ever do commissioned work
Like I need something for my house in
Alibaug something quite big in that old
style you used to have you know Very
abstract with lots of writing and things

Arun is looking tortured A bespectacled corporate-
looking man comes up to them

MAN
Hello sorry to interrupt hi Mona
(airkisses Lady Diamonds)
(MORE)
MAN (CONTD)
Arun I am Miraj Husain from the Indian
Council for Art I’ve been talking to
Vatsala about taking some works of yours
for a group show to Munich Brussels
London and Madrid

Arun nods a little high and wanting to escape Mona
drifts away bored

MIRAJ
Well I’m not sure if Vats discussed it
with you

Arun nods a negative vaguely looking around

MIRAJ (CONT’D)
Anyway its in September and she says
your next solo is much later so it
should work out Its a great showcase for
contemporary Indian art and is sure to
create a real buzz in the art market
Huge publicity probably a high profile
auction at the end You know Very big
names involved

Arun reaches for yet another drink and finishes it
rapidly Behind Miraj he can see someone writing a phone
no on his brochure resting it on one of his pieces Just
then Pesi comes up to them with Shai

PESI
Hi all Miraj you fraud you were
supposed to call me years ago

Miraj makes some sheepish excuses

PESI (CONT’D)
Anyway Arun this is Shai
(winking at her)
Enjoy love

Pesi engages Mira in conversation freeing Arun Arun
lets out a huge sigh smiles at Shai and looks relaxed
again

SHAT
That bad

ARUN
You have no idea Bless Pesi Arun

SHAT
Hi I’m Shai Yes I thought you looked a
bit stricken
Both laugh He knocks back his drink she’s vastly
amused and he looks at her with warmth They share some
sort of secret now

ARUN
So are you an artist too

SHAT
No no I’m an investment banking
consultant

ARUN
Means what Something to do with money
right

SHAT
(laughing)
Yes broadly speaking Essentially I
study investment trends in south Asian
economies

ARUN
Here in Bombay

SHAT
No in New York I’ve moved back here for
a bit though

ARUN
Oh Why

SHAT
Well I just needed a break from
things A new perspective some fresh
air in my head

ARUN
And you’re planning on getting that in
Bombay

SHAT
(laughs)
Maybe just a change of scene then Some
new faces no New York winter and no
talking about figures and projections

ARUN
Cool I could do with a holiday too

SHAT
Actually its not a holiday I’m ona
sabbatical
ARUN
Accha means what

SHAT
Means I’ve got a research grant to submit
a project about small and marginal
business and shifts in traditional
occupations Basically I have to write
some papers and do what I love doing
best - taking photographs

Arun raises his eyebrows as he keeps swigging his rum and
coke There’s a squawk from someone then a shriek anda
ripple of panic runs through the room as a rat scurries
to find safe refuge Shai is knocked against in the melee
and she gets red wine all over her shirt Arun starts
laughing and Shai though irritated can’t help laughing
as well wiping her shirt with a proffered napkin

SHAI (CONT’D)
Shit

ARUN
Now my show is truly open Cheers

They toast and drink together

EXT RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT

Munna walks along the tracks with a bucket of water in
his hand He has a towel and a soap in the other His
clothes have patches of brown dried blood on them and he
looks sleepy but not exhausted Its probably 4 am There
are lights on in some of the rooms of the slum as people
rise early for their jobs

He gets to an area beyond the slum and we see some
huddled shapes in the semi darkness doing their morning
jobs A drunk is lying with his head on the tracks Munna
puts his bucket down drags the drunk to a safer spot ten
feet away who mutters irritably and then carries on

He puts his bucket down at a point takes off his dirty
clothes and begins to splash the cold water on himself

his teeth chattering muttering some song words to

himself Soaping himself all over he washes his hair

then later sits in his towel with a lota to do his
morning job

As he heads back clean and sated the grey dawn breaks
and smoke curls out of the shanties

INT MUNNA’S ROOM - MORNING 9

The trains begin their rumble past Munna as he lies down
on his sheet inside his slum room (where another young
boy is sleeping) and falls asleep

INT A FLAT - DAY (DV FOOTAGE) 10

The digital camera is shooting the world waking up
outside an apartment window A big gulmohar tree covers
half the window and there is activity on the street below
- the milk vans people on their way to work

The camera zooms in to a window in the building opposite
where a woman in her nightie hurries to get breakfast and
tiffins ready in a kitchen The pressure cooker whistle
goes off in a cloud of steam and she stirs something in
a pan as she pours out tea into cups Her husband ina
dhoti with the morning paper comes in and gets his tea
and they exchange some inaudible words Over these images
we hear the same Girl’s voice whispered

GIRL (0OC)
Subah subah itni jaldi rehti hai sabko
jaise din sirf chaar chand ghante ki ho
Dekho kitni jaldi salan banati hai yeh
Lagta hai ki speed ke marks milte hain
yahan Phir zayke ka kya Kaun jane
Humare yahan bhi ek ‘Bai’ aati hai -
yahan kaam kaaj wali ko Bai bulate hain
Haay kya speed hai uske Jhat se bartan
kapde saphai sab khatam Do minute
zyada nahin thehregi Humari Zubeda khala
se itni alag voh to peeche pad jaati thi
ki aao baalon mein tel daal doon zara sa
maalish kar doon Bechari Kaisi hai voh
Use mera salaam kehna

INT ARUN’S APARTMENT - DAY 11

Its late morning Shai opens her eyes looking up at an
unfamiliar fan naked under a sheet She hears sounds
from the kitchen She shuts her eyes and smiles
snuggling back into the pillow

INT ARUN’S APARTMENT - LATER 12

Arun is standing at his window drinking tea fully bathed
and dressed looking out onto a noisy Bombay day

His apartment is small and in a mess Cartons lie
around and things look makeshift There is an empty
whisky bottle on the floor and two glasses Arun looks
worried

He turns around when he hears a click of a camera Shai
is in the room in an oversize man’s shirt over the
pantsskirt she had been wearing to the art opening She
has her camera in her hand

ARUN

wine stain

ARUN
(interrupting)

Arun goes to the kitchen and she follows He puts on the
electric kettle and rummages in the cupboard for a cup

SHAT

years And I don’t think I’ve ever danced
to what was it “Sexy Sadie”
(laughs)
You my friend are quite the dancer

ARUN
Milk and sugar

SHAT
Yes please
(she watches him)
I had a lovely time last night
She looks at him fondly but his smile is embarrassed and
he avoids looking at her He washes the cup and hunts
around for the sugar He pulls out a sachet from a bag of
sachets and goes to the fridge and pulls out a carton of
milk Shai wanders out into the living room and looks
around She sees a little sketchpersonal item of Arun’s
that she quickly puts in her pocket checking to see if
he saw She sees a painting on the bookshelf of a black
and white photograph of a couple The man is in army
uniform and the lady is a south Indian beauty in wedding
finery The photograph has been painted on with scraps
and bits stuck on - a button a safety pin a badge

SHAI (CONT’D)
(calling out to him)
Are these your parents

Arun hands her a mug of tea and settles against the
window again standing awkwardly while Shai settles into
a chair

Arun looks at the painting and nods with a half smile

She gives him a false smile and shuts the door behind

her He’s left staring at the closed door

INT LANDING OUTSIDE ARUN’S APARTMENT - DAY

As she disappears the lift reaches the landing and Munna
emerges with a bundle of clothes humming a tune

INT LANDING OUTSIDE ARUN’S APARTMENT - DAY (CONT’D) 14

washed and ironed clothes on the one available clear

of pouring rain

hugging the shade of the awnings while some are braving
the downpour with umbrellas and raincoats Men on cycles

cause a wave and get some healthy abuse from the victims

Then a car comes and does even more damage

freshly painted All the furniture is gone barring a
large dining table in the corner on which Arun has put
his computer and lots of books Siddheswari Devi is
singing thumri on his computer In the drawing room there
are two hooks for fans but only one has a fan There’s a
stack of cartons that he carries around looking for a
loft He finds one pulls a stool and tries to open it
Its stuck fast He gets a screwdriver and hammer and
chips it open In the light of his torch he finds a
couple of broken pieces of furniture and a small cloth
potli These he throws on the ground and stuffs the
cartons in

He sits at the table and opens the cloth potli In it
there’s a photograph of a girl and boy with an
old lady all smiling in a studio against a background of
a garden with tulips There’s also an old surme daani a
ring on a chain and three DV tapes The tapes have
written on their spine - Pehli Chitthi Doosri Chitthi

Shai is taking pictures of the circus artists from the
wings It seems like an impoverished troupe and the
clowns are not very funny Even the children aren’t
laughing The artists are so keen to pose for Shai one
of them (a juggler) forgets his cue They tell her how
the circus has lost its shine without the animals

There’s also a Wonder Dog an old Pomeranian who stands
on his hind legs and balances a ball on his head

She gives one-woof and two-woof answers to questions the
comic dog trainer asks her

DOG TRAINER
Toh bolo Sweety Uncle ko Aunty se pyaar
hai ki nahin

behind her ear and at some escaping flea on her back

INT THE FLAT (A) - NIGHT
Arun is on the phone The flat looks like its in order

ARUN

Rakesh yeh jo koi pehle rehte the na
yahan unka kuch saaman reh gaya kuch
tapes ek anguthi nahin chandi ki
kyun makaan malik ko de do na accha
voh log poochenge to Theek hai yaar
phenk deta hoon Par baad mein maangna
mat chalo

He disconnects then looks around and walks to the
window

In the flat across from his the lady is cooking dinner
The TV seems to be on there and a young boy runs in with
another boy talks to her and runs out On the other
side he sees a building under construction (which is
where Selva works) There is a big light on and workers
are still working

He looks around at his new space He picks up his drawing
book and sketches a bit of the view from his
windowdoodles then gets up stretches and looks around
He sees the stuff from the potli on the table He picks
up the photo and looks at it There’s a great warmth in
the faces bathed in clear light He picks up the tape and
looks at the cover turning it around in his hand

INT MULTIPLEX - NIGHT

Munna stands in the foyer of a theatre with two smartly
dressed girls He is wearing the cool striped shirt we
saw him hold up earlier and is toying with his cell
phone trying to look casual Salim comes up to them
balancing two bags of popcorn and a coke

SMART GIRL ONE
Salim hum itna popcorn nahin kha paenge

SALIM
Kisne kaha tum log ke liye hai

Salim and Munna laugh Salim hands one of the girls a bag
of popcorn and the girls laugh as well

SMART GIRL TWO
(to Munna)
Toh kaun se college mein padte ho

MUNNA
Main college nahin jata

SALIM
Arre college ke liye kiske paas time hai
Aur yeh Munna filmon mein kaam karta hai

The girls look very impressed Munna stares at him but
plays along with aplomb

SMART GIRL ONE
(a bit disbelieving)
Accha Kaun kaun si filmein kee hain

MUNNA
Maine er ek picture aayi thi Sanjay
Dutt ke saath jiska naam

Just then he spots Shai coming towards the entrance with
Pesi (who goes off towards the counter to buy them some
popcorn) and he tries to turn away so she doesn’t see
him But she does and she comes right over

SHAI
Zohaib right Hi

MUNNA
Erhi

SHAT
Kaun si film dekhne aaye ho

MUNNA
Yehi “Partner”

SHAT
Hum bhi vahi dekhne ja rahe hain Mera

As she heads in to the theatre Salim turns to Munna with
a raised eyebrow Munna’s stock value appears to have
appreciated

SALIM
Zohaib

MUNNA
Er Meri friend hai re Shai

They all begin to head in to the movie hall

SALIM
(knowingly teasing)
Achhaa Meri friend Shai huh Tu andar
chal beta main leta hoon teri class

INT CINEMA THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

Munna’s eyes follow Shai as she and Pesi find their
seats Salim notices this and smiles The lights go down

INT THE FLAT (A) - MOMENTS LATER

We see Arun sitting there with the camera connected to
the TV looking amazed He turns off the TV and looks
around him The same room the same dining table He
realizes that Yasmin lived in this very house He is
intrigued by that and starts thinking about it

INT LOCAL TRAIN - NIGHT

Its the late night train from Churchgate to - Munna

The city rushes by in pools of dark and light and neon

SALIM (0C)

(begins singing a love song)

Munna smiles and looks out

INT SHAI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Shai is in her dark room - a converted bathroom - where
she hand processes and prints pictures

She puts down some negatives to process then pulls off a
picture that’s hanging on the line to dry Its a black
and white picture of Arun looking out of a window big
buildings behind him in profile his eyes focussed on
something distant something unknown

The phone in the house rings and goes onto answering
machine Its her boyfriend Dale from New York

DALE
(a little crackly)

Hello This is Dale from New York for
Shai Shai I guess you’re not around

Hope this time out is helping Talk to
you soon Bye

We see her in the well appointed kitchen looking in the 29
fridge for something to eat There’s food in different
dishes but she spots a large watermelon on the counter

She chops it with a large knife getting juice all over
her and begins to cut wedges out

She is sitting on the bar stool in the kitchen eating
watermelon The TV is on (a small one on a high swivel)
and she is watching a game show where contestants who are
eliminated are crying and its all very dramatica soap
where frantic zoom-ins to women with yard-long sindoor
match the dramatic score

EXT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

One bright light illuminates the top of the building
where work still continues Our worker is laying bricks
and cement (or some work) and one can see the lights of
suburban Bombay around them

INT THE FLAT (A) - MORNING 31

Arun wakes up with a crick in his neck He had fallen
asleep watching the video the TV is still on and he has
the remote in his lap Daylight streams into the flat He
gets up stretches and goes over to the window He can
see the same lady in the flat opposite except her son is
almost a teenager now The lady is instructing the maid
now and she has henna in her hair Its a Sunday morning
and things are relaxed Arun looks radiant charged ina
way

He turns to the TV thoughtfully looking at the house
with new eyes Then he puts the kettle on for tea

INT SHAI’S APARTMENT - DAY 32

Shai is holding up her shirt which had the stain Its a
spotless white as good as new She turns and smiles
Munna avoids her gaze but one can tell he’s pleased

SHAT
Chai loge

Munna nods trying to look casual

Agnes who is standing near the two of them looks taken
aback at the exchange

SHAI (CONT’D)
Agnes please do cup chai banana

Agnes leaves not at all happy Shai walks to the
balcony gestures to him to follow

Munna looks around the house Sees himself in a mirror
and adjusts his hair He wears a cute Doors t shirt They
sit in chairs on the balcony and look out to sea Shai’s
camera is on a table which she has taken apart

SHAI (CONT’D)

about There’s a little awkward pause

Munna clucks his tongue in a negative

SHAI (CONT’D)

Bahut bhook lagti thi har vagqt bhook
Main jab Bambai aaya to chacha ne pehle
hotel mein kaam dilvaya Vahan mein khoob
khata tha - khana bhi aur thappad bhi

Shai laughs at the joke Munna is pleased

SHAT
Par vahan kya farming kya kehte
hain kheti nahin thi tum logon ki
MUNNA

Nahin hamare paas zameen nahin hai
Hamara jaat chamaar hai

Shai nods processing what that means Munna thinks for a
moment and then decides he should ask

MUNNA (CONT’D)
Aap mera photo le sakti hain

SHAT
Kya Sure

She reaches for the camera
MUNNA
Nahin nahin Aisa nahin Aap portfolio

of tea Shai looks at her pointedly and takes the glass
giving Munna the mug Agnes also holds up a shirt which
is Arun’s shaking it at Munna

(CrawfordMohammed Ali Road Null Bazaar) where bulbs
hang outside street stalls piled high with dried fruit
clothes ‘farsan’ and then bangles The camera stops at
the bangle seller and attempts to get through the thick
of girls trying on the discs of colour She finally
reaches the front and we see the spread of designs and
colours The bangle seller is not the very patient kind

BANGLE SELLER
Haan bibiji kya dikhaoon kaanch ke
chahiye arre main nikalta hoon
bibiji aap bas dikhaiye kaun sa

Meanwhile Yasmin is pulling out the ones she likes The
bangle seller is curious about her camera as are the

other girls there They smile at her and giggle when she
turns towards them

cadence

VANITHA
“The Brook“ by Alfred Lord Tennyson
“TI come from haunts of coot and hern
I make a sudden sally
and sparkle out among the fern
and bicker down the valley
By thirty hills I hurry down
or slip between the ridges
by twenty thorpes a little town
and half a hundred bridges
Till last by Philip’s farm I flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but I go on forever” Uske baad mein
bhool gayi

The Bai meanwhile has settled against the dining table
and done some tobacco rolling in her palm

Vah Bai yeh to bohot hoshiyaar hai

Arabic with pretty flourishes and loses it in the tug
of one wave

This time she quickly writes her name and as she
finishes it the wave takes it away Then she writes her
full name - Yasmin Noor - and then its erased Then as a
kick she writes - (atb)2 a2 2ab b2 and then its
gone She laughs
