BLACKNESS

Too inky and deep to see much A room of some kind And the
faint glow of an alarm clock’s LED reading 616

From another room a PHONE RINGS Muffled TALKING then

BOOM A door EXPLODES OPEN LIGHT pouring into the small
room revealing a WIRY RUSSIAN MAN asleep on a cot His WILD
HAIRED BROTHER shakes him awake

EXT BROOKLYN STREET - DAWN

The Russian Brothers exit their shit-hole walk-up dressed in
paint splattered work clothes and clutching mugs of instant
coffee They get into a Black Econoline Van and drive off

EXT SUPPLY STORE
The Black Van idling next to a loading dock RADIO BLARING

INT BLACK VAN

The Russians wait eyes on the Delivery Door Cold and
bored Wiry shakes out a line of crystal meth on the console
and SNORTS it

A STOCKY well-dressed MAN emerges from the side entrance
walks to the Van and drops a large paper bag onto the drivers
lap Speaks to them in Russian then disappears back inside

Wild Hair opens the bag and removes TWO TECH-9 HANDGUNS and
FOUR CLIPS of ammunition Hands them to his brother who
begins loading them

Wild Hair JERKS THE VAN onto a Brooklyn Street The Van
swallowed up by morning traffic

INT APARTMENT 4D - SAME TIME

Looking at the front door Chained dead bolted and police
locked Nothing out of the ordinary

Except the CAT in the FOYER that stares at the door
mesmerized at something we can’t see It just stares And
stares

Then suddenly the fur on it’s back stands on end and it BOLTS
just as

BOOM The door EXPLODES inward BATTERING RAM
DISTINTEGRATING the door jam HINGES FLYING every which way
as Police BURST inside WEAPONS DRAWN Lead team FREEZING
guns dropping to their side CAMERA drifts to the ground to
THREE shirtless DRUG COURIERS sprawled around acard table
covered with scales baking soda and baggies Elaborate
jailhouse tattoos interrupted with well placed bullet holes

Cannova pulls him inside the apartment

CANNOVA
I need you to baby sit this until
Uniforms get here Don’t leave

The hard-bodied cop then turns and herds the others towards
the stairs

Jack stands inside the apartment as the SOUND of both TEAMS
dissipate down the stairs

He takes out a handkerchief covers his nose and steps over

cabinets Finally finds a bottle of Cutty Sark under the
sink Flops down with it on a decomposing couch pulls a
DAILY NEWS from his back pocket and begins his wait

What’s left of the Russian’s face slides away revealing Jack
his gun barrel stiil smoking half-way across the street

EXT LAFAYETTE - SIMULTANEOUS

Jack stands in the middle of the street gun hand shaking
Tunnel vision and audio collapse washing over him Not
hearing the PEDESTRIAN SCREAMS or BRAKES SQUBAL around him

Nor seeing the Wiry Russian coming from around the Van
raising his Tech-9 until it’s too late

Turning just in time to HEAR the CHAMBER EXPLODE the exact
moment a skidding TAXI SIDESWIPES the Russian knocking the
shot a millimeter off line

PEDESTRIANS and SHOPKEEPERS scatter as the bullet SHATTERS a
plate glass window

and too crazed to register pain Leveling the machine
pistol and BLASTING AWAY

Eddie bends down and retrieves the notebook he dropped

Nugent looks at Jack with a shit-eating grin A large man
who doesn’t inhabit the room he consumes it Older than

there with a drink in his hand

confident

NUGENT

Jack hesitates Somethings not right about this Buthe’s
unable to keep his eyes off the booth near the door All
eyes shift across the room Eddie Bunker slowly rising from
beneath the table Eyes locking into Nugent’s A flicker of
recognition and fear Jack looking from Eddie to Nugent

Eddie BOLTS for the door but Mulvey and Torres grab him

Jack seeing Mulvey now uncuff Eddie and hold him while Torres
pulls a Saturday night special from his ankle and presses it
into Eddie’s shaking hand then lets it drop to the floor

Nugent looks back to his guys then to Jack

NUGENT (cont’d)
I figure it this way You pop the
guys trying to spring the rat
bastard but the little shit gets
your gun Takes you hostage We
come in and save the day “He dies

Like ordering a sandwich Waits for Jack to process it
Eyeing him like a father would the wayward son

NUGENT (cont’d)
Shit maybe you get a medal Get
your life straightened out Get
you back where you belong This
could be a good thing Jack

Torres nods to Nugent They’re ready

NUGENT (cont’d)
You want to stay for it

Jack doesn’t move Looks around the room Mulvey to his
left Torres on the right Shue dead center Now looks at
Eddie Body trembling eyes pleading with Jack

Eyes falling to his drink Staring into it like there might
be an answer there self loathing washing over his face
Nugent’s run out of patience and stands

NUGENT (cont’d)
Make yourself useful Pour us a
couple of drinks

Nugent crosses the room and nods to Shue Jack turns his
back unable to watch Reaching for the Chivas when he
catches Jerry Shue in the mirror eye-fucking Jack with a
shit-eating grin as he takes out his

Torres and Mulvey move away from Eddie Shue aiming the
gun

BLAM

The SOUND is DEAFENING Jack pulling the trigger on the
sawed-off Shotgun that was under the bar BLOWING Jerry
Shue’s left kneecap into tiny fragments Swinging and
racking at the same time both barrels leveled at Frank
Nugent’s heart arms a little shaky

Torres and Mulvey weapons still holstered freeze Dead
silence Every BREATH every CREAK magnified The writhing
unnatural MOANS of Jerry Shue the only SOUND

Frank Nugent doesn’t blink Stares right down the barrel of
Dominic Forlini’s taped up shotgun You’d swear his heart
never skipped a beat

NUGENT (cont’d)
That changes everything Jack

Jack moves around in front of the bar shotgun rising to
Nugent’s head

NUGENT (cont’d)
Jury’s tenure ends at ten That

Eddie hustles across the room and behind Jack Jack backing
the both of them towards the rear door

NUGENT
I can’t help you once you walk out
that door

Jack stepping over Jerry Shue eyeballs rolling back in his
head like an Atlantic City slot Eddie disappearing through
the curtain Jack holding Nugent’s stare trying to hold it
together

Then he’s gone

Torres and Mulvey grabbing their weapons Mulvey moving to
Jerry Torres out the back door Nugent looking down at
Jerry Shue with no emotion pulling his cell Eyeing the
neon clock over the bar

INT BASEMENT - CHINESE LAUNDRY

Dripping steam pipes feed a dozen industrial washers and
dryers Sweltering oppressive heat CHINESE WORKERS sort
and fold on both sides of a long cafeteria tables

Down a dark cinder block passageway Jack finding a drainage
grate dropping the shotgun into it

EDDIE
Don’t we need that

JACK
Had one shell in it for twenty
years Lucky it went off

Eddie staring at the drainage grate like it means something

Torres thick and massive moves with the methodical
concentration of a panther stalking its prey

INT CHINESE LAUNDRY

Street level Jack pulling Eddie out of the service elevator
and towards the door badge in the air for the surprised
OWNER to see Calming him in halting Chinese

Stepping next to a SEAMSTRESS working in the window peering
out No black van No Russian No Police

Jack unlocks Eddie’s cuffs Whips off his shirt tossing it
away Just a T-shirt now Hands Eddie a shirt from a
cleaning bin

JACK
Put this on

Then hands him a hanger of dry cleaning

JACK cont’d)
Walk slow Like you know where
you’re going Ill be right behind
you

EXT WEST BROADWAY - MORNING

Eddie steps into the street and starts South Jack three
steps behind the two weaving through the crowds Eddie dry
cleaning bag giung over his Shoulder hugging the shadows of
the building facades Jack’s eyes darting everywhere

PATROL CARS from Mid-Town South 1st and the 5th cruise by
from side streets None of it seems to bother Eddie walking
down West Broadway with a coolness in his step

JACK
They didn’t tell you Ryan was a
cop did they

EDDIE
I just saw his picture on the
table They never said he was
police

JACK
Well you’ re about to rat out the
top Homicide detective in the New
York City police department Bet
that’s worth more than a suit

Crossing Grand Street now blending in with the foot traffic
Getting lost in a sea of faces The Courthouse eleven
blocks away The clock on the MONY BUILDING steeple flashing

EXT GRAND STREET - SAME TIME

Frank Nugent stands in the doorway of a boarded up
Restaurant hands in his pockets One by one UNMARKED CARS
pull up and stocky MEN exit the vehicles Some in SUITS
others in WINDBREAKERS and JEANS WEAPONS jammed in the back
of pants and in shoulder holsters These are hard
unflinching COPS

We’re too far away to HEAR but it’s obvious Nugent is
briefing them No small talk either The facts the deal
and that’s it They break as quickly as they got there

Just as an OFFICIAL CAR pulls to the curb Out of it steps
DANIEL GRUBER Captain of the 5th and very pissed Again
we’re too far away to hear what’s being said But Nugent
seems to be a calming influence

They walk toward us and slowly we begin to hear

NUGENT
- put out descriptions over
precinct channels No names Or
that one’s a cop It’ll help to
have some eyes
(beat)
How long can you sit on this

GRUBER
He shot a cop for Christsakes
NUGENT
You’re the Precinct Captain Dan
How long
GRUBER
Hour Maybe a little more

Who’s on this with you

NUGENT
My guys Ortiz and Maldonado from
the six-six Touhey and Kaller
from the one-eleven A couple of
others you don’t want to know
about I’ve called in all favors

Gruber stares into the busy streets

GRUBER

falling down suddenly he’s a
cowboy What’s that about

UGENT
I woke him up That was my
mistake

(MORE)

NUGENT (contd)
He’1l probably do what he always
does and we can all go back to
work

GRUBER
And if he doesn’t

NUGENT
These are his streets Dan I want
to quash this thing before he gets
his legs back

(beat)
It’ll get ugly for the six of us if

destined to have And in order to
get there by noon I have to be

Eddie looks around the place then starts around the table

Alphonse making the man nervous appearing on the other
side

EDDIE (cont’d)

disinfected your utensils Or

Jack flinging it open Stares at the clothes a flash of
hurt and sadness appears on his face then it quickly
disappears

Leans down into the back of the closet and finally reemerges
with a dust covered 38 and a box of shells Eddie watchés
Jack stare uncomfortably at the clothes for a beat

Starting his way through the place Living room hallway

Returns to the living room holstering his gun

Almost out the door when Torres spots the empty shell box on
the coffee table

Torres quickly bolting the door turning senses heightened
Takes out his Glock and moves to the living room closet

Empty Now down the hall Into the bathroom checking the

Not prepared for THE MURPHY BED FALLING FROM THE WALL
Slamming into Torres and driving him into the ground
Pinning him underneath Jack and Eddie on top

Torres reaching his Glock fires a round through the
mattress The shell searing past Eddie’s ear

Jack rolling off the bed Torres feeling the cold steel of
Jack’s 38 against his temple Freezing as Jack COCKS THE

Eddie lifts the bed as Jack rolls Torres on his belly using
his handcuffs to secure his hands Jerks Torres to his feet
Eddie against the wall touching his ear Still feeling the
heat there

Always do what you’ve always
done

Lifts his foot grabs the token walks up and hands it to her

Jack says nothing Watches Eddie find a sliver of metal and
begin to fumble with the lock

to do that

how these beasts think

Forty-six hours later he hunts down
peddy and puts four in the back of

A long silence Mulvey entering Nugent’s room and nodding
silently

Why should we

JACK
Because we’re supposed to be the

(to Jack)
You went to my apartment

JACK
I needed my gun

EDDIE
It was very clean

Diane staring at Jack

EDDIE (cont’d)
There’s a hole in your Murphy bed
Other than that

She tries to continue working then stops Eyes boring into
ack

DIANE
I had Police grilling me for an
hour at the hospital

JACK
What’d you tell them

DIANE
That we’ve barely spoken in two
years That you were a self
medicating depressed individual
That you didn’t care anymore
About anything or anyone

(beat
I told them the truth
Jack stares at the floor Eddie very uncomfortable

DIANE (cont’d)
What’d you do this time Jack

EDDIE
Just saved my life three times
I’m an important witness to police
corruption

Diane looks to Jack for an explanation but gets none

EDDIE (cont’d)
He’s a good man lady Give him
another chance He’s gonna need
somebody to talk to when I leave

Jack and Diane stare at each other for several moments

JACK
Eddie Meet my sister Diane

EDDIE
Sister Shit For a second there
I had hope for you Even your
family don’t like you

Diane begins stitching the wound Eyes wandering to Jack

EDDIE (cont’d)
Haven’t seen my sister in eleven
years Lives in Seattle I’m
supposed to get on a bus tonight to
go see her

Diane smiles at Eddie but refuses to look at Jack

DIANE
The bullet missed his carotid I
did what I could with the mess in
there He moves around too much I
can’t promise it’1l hold

Ties it off and cuts Dresses it Slides over and takes
Jack’s hand Undoing the wrap

DIANE (cont’d)
He really shouldn’t be on his feet

JACK
A couple blocks

Diane sighs when she sees the bullet hole

JACK (cont’d)
I’m going to need one more favor

Diane’s EMT truck pulls out of the warehouse and slides onto
Franklin

INT BACK OF EMT TRUCK

Jack and Eddie bouncing around on opposite sides Weariness
oozes from both of them

EDDIE
And you never told me what you
wanted on your cake

JACK
Nothing in my life I want to see in

EDDIE

Gotta be one thing Pet first

There are some people who don’t
deserve to have part of their life
decorated on a cake I’m one of
them

I’m not a good guy Eddie

EDDIE

I think you are
(beat)

But if you don’t think so then
change There’s always a another
chance Third and fourth ones
I’m proof of that Just have to be
ready for them Look for the
signs Don’t quit

Jack stares into space at something only he can see

JACK
There are mistakes you make that
you pay for for the rest of your
ife No reprieves No second
chances

EDDIE

I don’t believe that

(beat)
Sometimes we do the right thing for
the wrong reason or the wrong thing
for what we think is the right
reason and it doesn’t work out and
we give up But if you do the
right thing for the right reason it
always turns out good Maybe not
right away But eventually

JACK
Eventually is a bunch of--

EDDIE
Don’t Let me have this one Jack
It’s all I got left to hold on to

Jack nods understands Long silence Then the Truck starts
to slow down

Moving down Leonard Street Top of the Courthouse peeking
above the buildings Not a cop in sight

EDDIE
Maybe they gave up

Getting to the corner of Centre and Leonard Peering out at
the Courthouse

JACK AND EDDIE’S POV THE COURTHOUSE

The towering granite monolith with massive columns supporting

the chiseled words “Only The Just Man Enjoys Peace of
Mind”
And beneath it a sea of blue DOZENS of Uniforms man

barricades that surround the Courthouse entrance MEDIA VANS
line the edges of Foley Park

Almost breathless from the sight Jack checking his watch

INT A VERY DARK ARBA - SAME TIME

Nugent clipping the radio to his belt then taking out his
Glock Torres and Mulvey hover in the shadows nearby

We can’t tell where they are exactly A blue emergency light
above a fire box the only illumination

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE

A massive steel columned structure sectioned off and
consuming the square city block

Jack and Eddie moving through a section containing City
Vehicles and trucks Just the SOUND of their footsteps and
the hum of fluorescents

JACK
Used to bring witnesses in this way
to avoid the media Called it
Gotti Avenue Hardly used anymore

They walk towards a set of double doors a hundred yards away
The reason we can see them in this darkness Is the blue
emergency light to the left of them

Walking in silence for a bit 60 yards away from those
shadows Both too tired to talk

Moving for the doors at the other end Twenty five yards
away Jack stopping and checking his watch

944
Reaching behind him for his handcuffs

JACK (cont’ d)
I should bring you in right

Eddie understands Hold out his arms

EDDIE
Think we’ll ever see each other
after this

JACK
Not in this lifetime Think of us
as two shits passing in the night

Turning and heading right for the doors Fifteen yards away
Moving under a section of giant steel beams

JACK (cont’d)
Hate this area You have to watch
out for all those pige--

Looking towards the rafters and seeing them empty - - A chill
going down his spine at that exact instant Shoving Eddie
out of the way as gun fire erupts from the shadows

Jack falling behind a Street Sweeper firing his 38 blindly
Firing two more shots and dashing to the other side to get
Eddie Finding him behind a snow plow

INT PARKING STRUCTURE

Nugent Torres and Mulvey step out of the shadows spread out
and advance with precision into the garage

JACK AND EDDIE

Moving silently between vehicles staying low Jack using
his gun to smaSh the fluorescents plunging the entire section
into darkness

Steering Eddie deeper into the cars Towards the back wall
but away from any way out

NUGENT MULVEY AND TORRES

Moving through the rows of cars and trucks parked end to end

No talk No taunts Just focused on killing and going home
Squeezing the target area smaller and smaller

JACK AND EDDIE

Crawling between a row City Sedans all the same color and
markings HEARING the SOUNDS of their movement but unable to
see them Stopping Jack easing open the back door to the
car

INT CITY SEDAN

Jack shoves Eddie inside removes the cuffs then cracks the
window a bit

JACK
Stay put When I yell your name
run for those double doors and
don’t stop till you get upstairs

Quietly shuts the door Eddie’s heart pounding as Jack’s
FOOTSTEPS ECHO away Neither on noticing the door not
completely closed

ON JACK

Staying low and moving away from Eddie Seeing under the
cars Waiting A glimmer of a polished shoe BLAM

Mulvey’s ankle bone shatters as he goes down hard Torres
and Nugent turning towards the SOUND Moving towards Jack
from two directions

JACK

Leading them farther and farther from Eddie

TORRES

Standing still and silent in the shadows Catches sight of
Jack’s figure moving into the row of SNOW PLOWS Moving
parallel and coming at Jack from his blind side

Seeing Jack disappear behind one Moving down on the other
side st the Plow Gun readied waiting for Jack to come
around

Never seeing the Plow door swing open Hitting Torres hard
on the shoulder knocking him to the cement Jack out and
slamming his gun to Torres skull before he can turn

NUGENT

Hearing Torres go down Staring into the black of the —
parking structure The first glint of uncertainty in his
eyes A SOUND of FOOTSTEPS running Nugent turning to the
SOUND

JACK
Crouched behind two Vehicles willing Nugent to stalk him
JACK
(to himself)
Come on

NUGENT

Staring into the shadows Sensing Jack’s position Starts
towards it Then stops Those spooky black eyes seeing like
bat Seeing the door of a parked sedan ajar two rows over

Moving down the aisle towards the Sedan

him Too scared to wait for Jack Kicks open the back door
and does what Jack wants him to do He runs

stumble for the double doors Nugent casually waiting
Eddie in his sights About to squeeze one off and
Freezing as the barrel of Jacks 38 is jammed in his ear

Not even a twitch

EXT 100 CENTRE STREET MORNING

The Courthouse still CRAWLING with COPS

EXT SAINT FRANCIS CHURCH

A crumbling sanctuary across the street from the Courthouse

INT CHURCH

Back doors burst open Jack and Eddie dragging Nugent inside
and dropping him in an aisle between the pews Jack ripping
a tasseled cord from a faded velvet curtain and tying his
hands behind him

JACK
I’m a hundred yards away That
scare ya Frank

NUGENT
You could be a hundred feet away
The two of ya will never get
inside

JACK
You have it half right

Checks his watch 950

A SOUND and FATHER JERRY CONNELLY 50 emerges from his
office behind the alter Unafraid and more than a little
tough even in his priestly get-up

FATHER CONNELLY
What’s going on--

Stops when Jack steps out of the shadows

FATHER CONNELLY (cont’ d)

Mosley

(smiling)
Twenty years I’ve been trying to
get you in here

(beat
Been on the news my friend Not
even sure God can help you now

JACK
Then I guess I’m stuck with you I
only got a couple minutes

Father Connelly looks down at the bloodied Frank Nugent

JACK (cont’d)
Bad guy

Then to Eddie

JACK (cont’d)
Good guy
(beat)
Very good guy

Father Connelly now looking into Jack’s eyes

JACK (cont’d)
Trying to be a good guy Just new
at it

He walks Father Connelly towards the Church doors

JACK (contd)
I’m asking you to trust me Jerry
What they’re saying on the news is
not what is All I want to do is
set that straight let the chips
fall where they may

Father Connelly smiles
FATHER CONNELLY
In 40 years I’ve never known you to
ask for anything

Father Connelly calling over a UNIFORM then is suddenly being
escorted towards the Courthouse steps

Jack walks to Eddie wincing with every breath Adjusting
the gauze on Eddie’s neck

JACK
You hurry you might make it

Eddie’s confused

EDDIE
But I have to testify

Jack squeezes out a wounded sigh

JACK

No you don’t I used you Eddie I
risked your life because you were
going to do what I couldn’t

Eddie listening Jack stares up at the ceiling

JACK cont’d)

I was one of them One of the
team And I was in that room when
that old man died I was on his
couch when Frank stuck that gun in
his mouth

(beat)
Mr Ling Remember his name Frank

Nugent saying nothing Jack’s words coming harder now

JACK (contd)
I sat there as Frank told the old
man that he didn’t see what he saw
I watched Frank get more and more
pissed because the guy wouldn’t
change his story Not understanding
why the police are asking him to
lie Frank screaming at him
Next thing I know Frank’s got the
barrel of his gun in the guy’s
mouth hammer back

The searing painful images flying through Jack’s head
JACK (cont’d)

I’m screaming at Frank to cool down
when he just fell

Tears starting to show

JACK (cont’d)
That old man was doing the right
He was telling the truth

thing
And he’s dead because of it

Jack staring into space

JACK (cont’ d)
Walked out of there and never said
a word Not that day Not the
next Not ever Frank knew I
wouldn’t Because he trained me to
be just like him Only he could
forget it And I couldn’t

Looks down at Nugent

JACK (cont’d)

I looked back and realized I was
heading for that night for a long
time Making my own rules or
following his Until I was as
broken and corrupt as him

beat
I didn’t care after that night
About me or anything

The last words echo through the church For a while no one
speaks

EDDIE
But you stayed a cop

Jack looking up

EDDIE (cont’d)

I mean you didn’t retire Take a
pension and disappear Deep down
you knew if you left you’d never
tell And he’d win

(beat)
I wasn’t meant to meet you You
were meant to meet me This is
where you’re supposed to be

Jack finally looks at Eddie but can find no words

EDDIE (cont’d)
This is your other chance Jack
You knew that back in that bar
Only now it’s for the right reason

CHURCH DOORS opening and Father Connelly coming in

FATHER CONNELLY
It’s all set You tell them
Detective Nugent’s whereabouts and
youll get your say Deals off you

private quarters It’ll leave you
out near Sixth Avenue Far away
from what’s out there

Jack smiles Walks Eddie to a set of doors behind the alter

JACK
Hope you make it
EDDIE
I will It’s meant to be Jack

(beat)
I’1l1 call you sometime

JACK
Don’t That way I won’t know if

elieve what I want

In spite of the pain Eddie smiles That same damn smile
he had when we first met him in that cell ninety-eight
minutes ago

EDDIE
Aw Jack There you go being
negative again

Turns to go

JACK
Hey

Eddie stopping

JACK (cont’d)
What’s the answer

EDDIE

Give the keys to your best friend

up at where the shot came from Sheehan SCREAMING OVER HIS

Ray Fitzpatrick stunned as OTHER SWAT TEAM MEMBERS race to
his spot and grab his weapon

Jack crumpling to the ground All feeling leaving his body
Blurred faces going white SOUNDS far away and muffled
Eyes staring into white light feeling nothing anymore No

Then a gust of wind is sucked into his lungs Faces slowly
drift back into focus Father Connelly saying something but
Jack can’t hear him
