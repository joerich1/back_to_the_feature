SLOW DISSOLVE TO

HOLLYWOOD SEEN FROM
THE HILLTOP AT IVAR

It is a crisp sunny
day The voice con-
tinues speaking as
CAMERA PANS toward

the ALTO NIDO APART-
MENT HOUSE an ugly
Moorish structure ofsat
stucco about four
stories high CAMERA
MOVES TOWARD AN OPEN
WINDOW on the third
floor where we look

in on JOE GILLIS APART-
MENT Joe Gillis bare-
footed and wearing no-
thing but an old bath-
robe is sitting on
the bed In front of
him ona straight
chair is a portable
typewriter Beside
him on the bed is a

proportion before those

Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it
maybe youd like to
hear the facts the
whole truth

MANS VOICE
If so youve come to the
right party You see
the body of a young man
was found floating in the
pool of her mansion with
two shots in his back and
one in his stomach No-
body important really
Just a movie writer with
a couple of B pictures
to his credit The poor
dope He always wanted a
pool Well in the end
he got himself a pool --
only the price turned out
to be a little high
Lets go back about six
months and find the day
when it all started

was living in an
partment house above
ranklin and Ivar
hings were tough

t the moment I hadnt
orked in a studio for
long time So I
here grinding

out original stories
two a week Only I
seemed to have lost

my touch Maybe they
werent original
enough Maybe they
were too original

All I know is they
didnt sell

to eo AM H
dirty ashtray and a
scattering of type
written and pencil-
marked pages Gillis
is typing witha
pencil clenched bet-
ween his teeth

JOE GILLIS APARTMENT

It is a one-room affair with an unmade Murphy bed
pulled out of the wall at which Gillis sits typing
There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs anda
Spanish-style wrought-iron standing lamp Also a
small desk littered with books and letters anda
chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some
records on top On the walls are a couple of repro-
ductions of characterless paintings with laundry
bills and snapshots stuck in the frames Through an
archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette complete with
unwashed coffee pot and cup empty tin cans orange
peels etc The effect is dingy and cheerless --
just another furnished apartment The buzzer SOUNDS

GILLIS
Yeah

The buzzer SOUNDS again Gillis gets up and opens
the door Two men wearing hats stand outside one of
them carrying a briefcase

NO 1
Joseph C Gillis

GILLIS
Thats right

The men ease into the room No 1 hands Gillis a
business card

No 1
Weve come for the car

GILLIS

NO 2
(Consulting a paper)
1946 Plymouth convertible Calif-
ornia license 97 N 567
No 1
Where are the keys

GILLIS
Why should I give you the keys

NO 1
Because the companys played ball
with you long enough Because
youre three payments behind And
because weve got a Court order
Come on -- the keys

NO 2
Or do you want us to jack it up
and haul it away

GILLIS
Relax fans The car isnt here

GILLIS
I lent it to a friend of mine
He took it up to Palm Springs

NO 1

GILLIS
You dont believe me Look in
the garage

NO 1

want you to believe us That car

or theres going to be fireworks

GILLIS
You say the cutest things

The men leave Gillis
stands pondering beside
the door for a moment
Then he walks to the
center of the room and
with his back to the

GILLIS VOICE
Well I needed about two
hundred and ninety dollars
and I needed it real
quick or Id lose my car
It wasnt in Palm Springs
CAMERA slips into a
pair of gray slacks
There is a metallic

noise as some loose
change and keys drop
from the trouser pockets
As Gillis bends over to
pick them up we see that
he has dropped the car
keys identifiable be-
cause of a rabbits

foot and a miniature
license plate attached
to the key-ring Gillis
pockets the keys and as
he starts to put ona
shirt

DISSOLVE TO

EXTERIOR OF RUDYS
SHOESHINE PARLOR (DAY)

A small shack-like build-
ing it stands in the
corner of a public park-
ing lot Rudy a

colored boy is giving

a customer a shine

and it wasnt in the
garage
of the finance company

I was way ahead

GILLIS VOICE

I knew theyd be coming
around and I wasnt tak-
ing any chances so I
kept it a couple of
blocks away in a parking
lot behind Rudys Shoe-
shine Parlor Rudy
never asked any quest-â€”
ions Hed just look at
your heels and know the
score

PAN BEHIND the shack to GILLIS CAR a yellow 1946

Gillis enters

Plymouth convertible with the top down
the SHOT He is wearing a tweed sport jacket a tan
polo shirt and moooasins He steps into the car and
drives it off Rudy winks after him

THE ALLEY NEXT TO SIDNEYS

MENS SHOP ON BRONSON AVE

Gillis drives into the
alley and parks his car
right behind a delivery
truck PAN AND FOLLOW
HIM as he gets out walks
around the corner into
Bronson and then toward
the towering main gate of

GILLIS VOICE
I had an original story
kicking around Paranount
My agent told me it was
dead as a doornail but
I knew a big shot over
there whod always liked
me and the time had
come to take a little
advantage of it His
Paramount A few loafers name was Sheldrake He

studio cops and extras are was a smart producer

lounging there with a set of ulcers to
prove it

DISSOLVE TO
SHELDRAKES OFFICE

It is in the style of a Paramount executives office --
mahogany leather and a little chintz On the

walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount
stars with dedications to Mr Sheldrake Also a
couple of framed critics awards certificates and an
Oscar on a bookshelf A shooting schedule chart is
thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board There are
piles or scripts a few pipes and somewhere in the
background some set models

Start on Sheldrake He is about 45 Behind his wor-
ried face there hides a coated tongue He is en-
gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in

his Zeus holder

SHELDRAKE
All right Gillis Youve got
five minutes Whats your story
about

GILLIS
Its about a ball player a rookie
shortstop thats batting 347 The
poor kid was once mixed up in a hold-
up But hes trying to go straight --
except theres a bunch of gamblers
who wont let him

SHELDRAKE
So they tell the kid to throw the
World Series or else huh

GILLIS
More or less Only for the end
Ive got a gimmick thats real good

A secretary enters carrying a glass or milk
She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for
Sheldrake

SHELDRAKE
Got a title
GILLIS
Bases Loaded Theres a 40-page
outline

SHELDRAKE
(To the secretary)
Get the Readers Department and
see what they have on Bases Loaded

The secretary exits Sheldrake takes a pill and
washes it down with some milk

GILLIS
Theyre pretty hot about it
over at Twentieth but I
think Zanucks all wet Can
you see Ty Power as a

GILLIS (contd)
shortstop Youve got the best
man for it right here on this lot
Alan Ladd Good change of pace for
Alan Ladd Theres another thing
its pretty simple to shoot Lot
of outdoor stuff Bet you could
make the whole thing for under a
million And theres a great little
part for Bill Demarest One of the
trainers an oldtime player who
got beaned and goes out of his head
sometimes

The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean-
cut nice looking girl of 21 with a bright alert
manner Dressed in tweed skirt Brooks sweater and
pearls and carrying a folder of papers She puts
them on Sheldrakes desk not noticing Gillis who
stands near the door

BETTY
Hello Mr Sheldrake On that Bases
Loaded I covered it with a 2-page
synopsis
(She holds it out)
But I wouldnt bother

SHELDRAKE
Whats wrong with it

BETTY
Its from hunger
SHELDRAKE
Nothing for Ladd

BETTY
Just a rehash of something that
wasnt very good to begin with

SHELDRAKE
Im sure youll be glad to meet
Mr Gillis He wrote it

Betty turns towards Gillis embarrassed

SHELDRAKE
This is Miss Kramer

BETTY
Schaefer Betty Schaefer And
right now I wish I could crawl
into a hole and pull it in after
me

GILLIS
If I could be of any help

BETTY
Im sorry Mr Gillis but I
just dont think its any good
I found it flat and banal

GILLIS
Exactly what kind of material do
you recommend James Joyce
Dostoosvsky

SHELDRAKE
Name dropper

BETTY
I just think pictures should say
a little something

GILLIS
Oh youre one of the message
kids Just a story wont do
Youd have turned down Gone With the
Wind

SHELDRAKE
No that was me I said Who
wants to see a Civil War picture
BETTY
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases
Loaded is that I knew your name
Id always heard you had some
talent

GILLIS
That was last year This year
Im trying to earn a living

BETTY
So you take Plot 27-A make it
glossy make it slick --

SHELDRAKE
Carefull Those are dirty words
You sound like a bunch of New
York critics Thank you Miss
Schaefer

BETTY
Goodbye Mr Gillis

GILLIS
Goodbye Next time Ill write
The Naked and the Dead

Betty leaves

SHELDRAKE
Well seems like Zanucks got
himself a baseball picture

GILLIS
Mr Sheldrake I dont want you
to think I thought this was going
to win any Academy Award

SHELDRAKE
(His mind free-wheeling)
Of course were always looking
for a Betty Hutton Do you see
it as a Betty Hutton

GILLIS
Frankly no

SHELDRAKE
(Amusing himself)
Now wait a minute If we made
it a girls softball team put
in a few numbers Might make a
cute musical It Happened in
the Bull Pen -- the story of a
Woman

GILLIS
You trying to be funny -- because
Im all out of laughs Im over a
barrel and I need a job

SHELDRAKE
Sure Gillis If something should
come along -

GILLIS
Along is no good I need it now

SHELDRAKE
Havent got a thing

GILLIS
Any kind of assignment Additional
Dialogue

SHELDRAKE

Theres nothing Gillis Not
even if you were a relative

GILLIS
(Hating it)
Look Mr Sheldrake could you
let me have three hundred bucks
yourself as a personal loan

SHELDRAKE
Could I Gillis last year some-
body talked me into buying a ranch
in the valley So I borrowed money
from the bank so I could pay for
the ranch This year I had to
mortgage the ranch so I could keep
up my life insurance so I could
borrow on the insurance so I could
pay my income tax Now if Dewey
had been elected -

GILLIS
Goodbye Mr Sheldrake

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SCHWABS DRUG STORE
(EARLY AFTERNOON ACTIVITY)

MOVE IN toward drug store
and

DISSOLVE TO

INT SCHWABS DRUG STORE

The usual Schwabadero
crowd sits at the fount-
ain gossips at the
cigar-stand loiters by
the magazine display
MOVE IN towards the TWO
TELEPHONE BOOTHS In
one of them sits Gillis
a stack of nickels in
front of him Hes
doing a lot of talking
into the telephone
hanging up dropping
another nickel dialing
talking again

GILLIS VOICE
After that I drove down
to headquarters Thats
the way a lot of us think
about Schwabs Drug Store
Actors and stock girls and
waiters Kind of a
combination office Kaffee-
Klatsch and waiting room
Waiting waiting for the
gravy train

I got myself ten nickels
and started sending out

a general S0OS Couldnt
get hold of my agent

naturally So then I
called a pal of minename
of Artie Green -- an awful

nice guy an assistant
director He cquld let me
have twenty but twenty
wouldnt do

GILLIS VOICE (Cont)

Then I talked to a couple of

yes men at Twentieth
they said no

To me
Finally I

located that agent of mine the
big faker Was he out digging
up a job for poor Joe Gillis
Hmph He was hard at work in
Bel Air making with the golf
clubs

Gillis hangs up with a curse opens the door of the
booth emerges wiping the sweat from his forehead
He walks toward the exit He is stopped by the
voice of

SKOLSKY
Hello Gillis

Gillis looks around At the fountain sits Skolsky
drinking a cup of coffee

GILLIS
Hello Mr Skolsky

SKOLSKY
Got anything for the column

GILLIS
Sure Just sold an original for
a hundred grand The Life of the
Warner Brothers Starring the Ritz
Brothers Playing opposite the
Andrew Sisters

SKOLSKY
(With a sour smile)
But dont get me wrong -- I love

Hollywood
Gillis walks out

DISSOLVE TO

THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS

On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores
stands Morino the agent a caddy and a nondescript
opponent in the background Gillis has evidently
stated his problem already

MORINO
So you need three hundred dollars
Of course I could give you three
hundred dollars Only Im not
going to

GILLIS
No

MORINO
Gillis get this through your
head Im not just your agent
Its not the ten per cent Im

He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee
Gillis following him

GILLIS
Hows that about your being my
friend
MORINO
Dont you know the finest things
in the world have been written on
an empty stomach Once a talent
like yours gets into that Mocambo-
Romanoff rut youre through

GILLIS
Forget Romanoffs Its the car

car its like having my legs out off

MORINO
Greatest thing that could happen
to you Now youll have to sit
behind that typewriter Now
youll have to write

GILLIS
What do you think Ive been doing

MORINO
(Icily)
Maybe what you need is another agent

He bends down to tee up his ball Gillis

Suddenly his eyes fall you could -- Oh-oh
on

A-16 ANOTHER CAR

It is a dark-green Dodge business coupe also waiting
for the light to change but headed in the opposite
direction In it are the two finance company men
They spot Gillis in his car and exchange looks From
across the intersection Gillis recognizes them and
pulls down the leather sunshade to screen his face
As the light changes Gillis gives his car the gun
and shoots away The men narrowly avoid hitting
another car as they make a U-turn into oncoming
traffic and start after him

A-17 THE CHASE
to
A-21 Very short very sharp told in FLASHES (Use

locations on Sunset between Bel Air and Holmby Hills)
The men lose Gillis around a bend catch sight of him
and then -- while they are trapped behind a slow-
moving truck he disappears again

A-22 GILLIS

He is driving as fast as he dares keeping an eye out
for pursuit in his rear-view mirror Suddenly his

right front tire blows out Gillis clutches desperately
at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening
car into

A-23 A DRIVEWAY

It is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street
by bushes and trees Gillis stops his car about thirty
feet from the street and looks back

GILLIS VOICE
Was I far enough ahead

A-24 THE OTHER CAR
shoots past the driveway still looking for Gillis

A-25 GILLIS
He watches his pursuers GILLIS VOICE
shoot past and out of Yeah
sight He opens the
door and looks down at I had landed myself in the
the flat tire Then he
looks around to see
where he is

DRIVEWAY WITH GARAGE

An enormous five-car
affair neglected and
empty-looking

GILLIS

He gets back into his

car and carefully pilots
the limping vehicle into
one of the stalls In
the adjoining one is a
large dust-covered
Isotta-Fraschini propped
up on blocks He closes
the garage door and walks
up the driveway In idle
curiosity he mounts a
stone staircase which
leads to the garden
CAMERA IN BACK OF HIM

At the top of the steps
he sees the somber pile
of

NORMA DESMONDS HOUSE
It is a grandiose --
Italianate structure
mottled by the years
gloomy forsaken
little formal garden

driveway of some big mansion
that looked run-down and
deserted At the end of the
drive was a lovely sight
indeed -- a great big empty
garage just standing there
going to waste If ever there
was a place to stash away a
limping car with a hot license
number

There was another occupant in
that garage an enormous
foreign-built automobile It
must have burned up ten gallons
to a mile It had a 1932
license I figured thats
when the owners moved out

I also figured I couldnt go
back to my apartment now that
those bloodhounds were on to
me The idea was to get Artie
Greens and stay there till I
could make that bus for Ohio
Once back in Dayton Id drop
the credit boys a picturepost-
card telling them where to

pick up the jallopy

GILLIS VOICE

t was a great big white
elephant of a place
crazy movie people built in the
crazy Twenties
house gets an unhappy look

The kind

A neglected

completely gone to
seed

From somewhere above
comes

This one had it in spades It
was like that old woman in
Great Expectations -- that Miss
Haversham in her rotting wed-
ding dress and her torn veil
taking it out on the world be-
cause shed been given the go-
by

A WOMANS VOICE

You there

Gillls turns and looks

UPSTAIRS LOGGIA
Behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of
a dark figure

WOMANS VOICE
Wlly are you so late Why have
you kept me waiting so long

GILLIS

He stands flabbergasted A new noise attracts his
attention -- the creak of a heavy metal-and-glass
door being opened He turns and sees

THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE

Max von Mayerling stands there He is sixty and
all in black except for immaculate white cotton
gloves shirt high stiff collar and a white bow
tie His coat is shiny black alpaca his trousers
ledger-atriped He is semi-paralyzed The left
side of his mouth is pulled down and he leans on a
rubber-ferruled stick

MAX
In here

Gillis enters the shot

GILLIS
I just put my car in the garage
I had a blow-out I thought --

MAX
Go on in

There is authority in the gesture of his white-
gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside

GILLIS
Look maybe Id better take my
car --

MAX

Wipe your feet

Automatically Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous
shabby cocoanut mat

MAX
You are not dressed properly
GILLIS
Dressed for what

THE WOMANS VOICE
Max Have him come up Max

MAX
(Gesturing)
Up the stairs

GILLIS
Suppose you listen just for a
minute -

MAX

Madame is waiting

GILLIS
For me Okay

Gillis enters

INT NORMA DESMONDS ENTRANCE HALL

It is grandiose and grim The whole place is one of
those abortions of silent-picture days with bowling
alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ and
beams imported from Italy with California termites

at work on them Portieres are drawn before all the
windows and only thin slits or sunlight find their
way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
burning

Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
staircase It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
velvet rope along the wall

MAX
(From below)
If you need help with the
coffin call me

The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis
imagination He climbs the stairs with a kind of
morbid fascination At the top he stops undecided
then turns to the right and is stopped by

WOMANS VOICE
This way
Gillis swings around

Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
doorway from which emerges a flickering light She
is a little woman There is a curious style a

great sense of high voltage about her She is dress-â€”
ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
pumps Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
terned scarf and wound around her head a turban of
the same material Her skin is very pale and she

is wearing dark glasses

NORMA
In here I put him on my massage
table in front of the fire He
always liked fires and poking at
them with a stick

Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into

NORMA DESMONDS BEDROOM

It is a huge gloomy room hung in white brocade which
has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
torn in a few places Theres a great unmade gilded
bed in the shape of a swan from which the gold had
begun to peel There is a disorder of clothes and
negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
about

In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
ing On the massage table before it lies a small
form shrouded under a Spanish shawl At each end on
a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
labrum the candles lighted

NORMA
Ive made up my mind well bury him in
the garden Any city laws against that

GILLIS
I wouldnt know

NORMA
I dont care anyway I want the
coffin to be white And I want
it specially lined with satin
White or deep pink
She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
color From under the shawl flops down a dead arm
Gillis stares and recoils a little It is like a
childs arm only black and hairy

NORMA
Maybe red bright flaming red
Gay Lets make it gay

Gillis edges closer and glances down Under the
shawl he sees the sad bearded face of a dead
chimpanzee Norma drops back the shawl

NORMA
How much will it be I warn you -
dont give me a fancy price just
because Im rich

GILLIS
Lady youve got the wrong man

For the first time Norma really looks at him
through her dark glasses

GILLIS
had some trouble with my car
Flat tire I pulled into your
garage till I could get a spare
thought this was an empty house

NORMA
t is not Get out

GILLIS
m sorry and Im sorry you lost
your friend and I dont think red
is the right color

NORMA
Get out

GILLIS
Sure Wait a minute -- havent
I seen you --

NORMA
Or shall I call my servant

GILLIS
I know your face Youre Norma
Desmond You used to be in
pictures You used to be big

NORMA
am big Its the pictures
that got small

GILLIS
knew there was something
wrong with them

NORMA
Theyre dead Theyre finished
There was a time when this busi-
ness had the eyes of the whole
wide world But that wasnt good
enough Oh nol They wanted the
ears of the world too So they
opened their big mouths and out
came talk talk talk

fq

fq

GILLIS
Thats where the popcorn business
comes in You buy yourself a bag
and plug up your ears

NORMA
Look at them in the front offices --
the master minds They took the
idols and smashed them The
Fairbankses and the Chaplins and
the Gilberts and the Valentinos
And who have they got now Some
nobodies -- a lot of pale little
frogs croaking pish-poshl

GILLIS
Dont get sore at me Im not
an executive Im just a writer
NORMA

You are Writing words words

Youve made a rope of words and
strangled this businessl But there

is a microphone right there to catch
the last gurgles and Technicolor

to photograph the red swollen tongue

GILLIS
Ssh Youll wake up that monkey
NORMA
Get out

Gillis starts down the stairs

GILLIS
Next time Ill bring my autograph
album along or maybe a hunk of
cement and ask for your footprints

He is halfway down the staircase when he is
stopped by

NORMA
Just a minute you

GILLIS
Yeah

NORMA
Youre a writer you said

GILLIS
Why

Norma starts down the stairs

NORMA
Are you or arent you

GILLIS
I think thats what it says on my
drivers license

NORMA
And you have written pictures
havent you

GILLIS
Sure have The last one I
wrote was about cattle rustlers
Before they were through with it
the whole thing played on a
torpedo boat

Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase
NORMA

I want to ask you something
Come in here
She leads him into

THE HUGE LIVING ROOM

It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and

red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
from the Mark of Zorro set Along the main wall

a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years

On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of

Norma Desmond in her various roles On one wall
is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene
Carthay Circle school (We will learn later that

it hides a motion picture screen)

One corner is filled with a large pipe organ and
as Norma and Gillis enter there is a grizzly
moaning sound Gillis looks around

NORMA
The wind gets in that blasted
pipe organ I ought to have
it taken out

GILLIS
Or teach it a better tune

Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
side by side near a window They are piled high
with papers scrawled in a large uncertain hand

NORMA
How long is a movie script these
days I mean how many pages

GILLIS
Depends on what it is -- a Donald
Duck or Joan or Arc

NORMA
This is to be a very important
picture I have written it

myself Took me years

GILLIS
(Looking at the piles
of script)
Looks like enough for six impor-
tant pictures

NORMA
Its the story or Salome I
think Ill have DeMille direct it

GILLIS
Uh-huh

NORMA
Weve made a lot of pictures
together

GILLIS
And youll play Salome

NORMA
Who else

GILLIS
Only asking I didt know
you were planning a comeback

NORMA
I hate that word It is a return
A return to the millions of people
who have never forgiven me for
deserting the screen

GILLIS
Fair enough

NORMA
Salome -- what a woman What a
part The Princess in love with
a Holy man She dances the Dance
of the Seven Veils He rejects
her so she demands his head on a
golden tray kissing his cold dead
lips

GILLIS
Theyll love it in Pomona

NORMA

(Taking it straight)
They will love it every place

(She reaches for a

batch of pages from

the heap)
Read it Read the scene just
before she has him killed

GILLIS
Right now Never let another
writer read your stuff He

may steal it

NORMA
I am not afraid

NORMA
(Calling)
Max Max
(To Gillis)
Sit down

GILLIS

Read it

(Cont d)

Is there enough light

Ive got twenty-twenty vision

Max has entered

NORMA

Bring something to drink

MAX
Yes Madame

He leaves

NORMA
I said sit down

Norma turns to Gillis again

There is compulsion in her voice

Gillis looks at her
and starts slowly
reading

Max comes in wheeling
a wicker tea wagon on
which are two bottles o
Â£ champagne and two

red Venetian glasses

a box of zwieback and

a jar of caviar Norma
sits on her feet deep
in a chair a gold ring
on her forefinger with

cigarette She gets up
and forces on Gillis
another batch of script
goes back to her chair

GILLIS VOICE
Well I had no pressing
engagement and shed men-
tioned something to drink
Sometimes its interesting
to see just how bad bad
writing can be This prom-
ised to go the limit I
wondered what a handwriting
expert would make of that
childish scrawl of hers
Max wheeled in some champagne
and some caviar Later I
found out that Max was the
only other person in that
grim Sunset castle and I
found out a few other things
about him As for her she
sat coiled up like a watch
spring her cigarette
clamped in a curious holder
I could sense her eyes on me

beside him is now
really paying its

A lot of the manu-

piled on the floor
around his feet A
half-empty champagne
glass stands on the
arm of his chair

from behind those dark
glasses defying me not to
like what I read or maybe
begging me in her own proud
way to like it It meant
so much to her

GILLIS VOICE
t sure was a cozy set-up
That bundle of raw nervesand
Max and a dead monkey upstair
and the wind wheezing through
that organ once in a while
Later on just for comedy
relief the real guy arrived
with a baby coffin It was
all done with great dignity
He must have been a very
important chimp The great
grandson of King Kong maybe

It got to be eleven I was
feeling a little sick at my
stomach what with that sweet
champagne and that tripe Id
been reading -- that silly
hodgepodge of melodramatic
plots However by then Id
started concocting a little
plot of my own

There is a

Well

GILLIS
This is fascinating
NORMA
Of course it is

GILLIS
Maybe its a little long and
maybe there are some repetitions
but youre not a professional
writer

NORMA
I wrote that with my heart

GILLIS
Sure you did Thats what makes
it great What it needs is a
little more dialogue

NORMA
What for I can say anything I
want with my eyes

GILLIS
It certainly could use a pair of
shears and a blue pencil

NORMA
I will not have it butchered

GILLIS
Of course not But it ought to
be organized Just an editing
job You can find somebody

NORMA
Who Id have to have somebody
I can trust When were you born --
I mean what sign of the zodiac

GILLIS

NORMA
I dont care

GILLIS
You know Im pretty expensive

NORMA
I wouldnt worry about money

GILLIS
Maybe Id better take the rest

NORMA
Oh no I couldnt let it out

GILLIS
Its getting kind of late --

ING TO ROOM OVER GARAGE I felt kind of pleased with
the way Id handled the sit-

Max an electric light uation Id dropped the hook

bulb in his hand is and shed snapped at it Now
leading Gillis up my car would be safe down
Gillis carries a batch below while I did a patch-
of the manuscript up job on the script And

there should be plenty of
money in it

Max pushes open a door at the top of the stairs

MAX
(Opening the door)
I made your bed this afternoon

GILLIS
Thanks
(On second thought)
How did you know I was going to
stay this afternoon

Max doesnt answer He walks across to the bed
screws a bulb in the open socket above it The
light goes on revealing

A GABLED BEDROOM

There are dirty windows on two sides and dingy wall-
paper on the cracked plaster walls For furniture
there is a neatly made bed a table and a few chairs
which might have been discarded from the main house

MAX
This room has not been used for
a long time

GILLIS
It will never make house Beautiful
I guess its OK for one night

Max gives him an enigmatic look

MAX
(Pointing)
There is the bathroom I put in
soap and a toothbrush

GILLIS

Thanks

(He starts taking off
his coat)

Say shes quite a character
that Norma Desmond

MAX

She was the greatest You wouldnt
know You are too young In one
week she got seventeen thousand fan
letters Men would bribe her mani-
curist to get clippings from her
fingernails There was a Maharajah
who came all the way from Hyderabad
to get one of her stockings Later
he strangled himself with it

GILLIS
I sure turned into an interesting
driveway

MAX

You did sir
GILLIS VOICE

He goes out Gillis I pegged him as slightly
looks after him hangs cuckoo too A stroke maybe

THE DESMOND HOUSE There was a tennis court or

At the bottom of the basin a great rat is eating a
decaying orange From the inlet pipe crawl two
other rats who join battle with the first rat over

looks down again

Norma Desmond and Max are
carrying the white coffin
towards a small grave as
which has been dug in the
dead turf Norma carries
one of the candelabra all
of its candles flickering
in the wind They reach
the grave and lower the
coffin into it Then
Norma lighting his task

takes a spade from the
loose earth and starts
filling in the grave

He watches the scene be-

There was something
else going on below
the last rites for
that hairy old chimp
performed with the
utmost seriousness --
as if she were laying
to rest an only child
Was her life really
as empty as that

It was all very queer
but queerer things
were yet to come
The day is overcast The
house is shrouded in low

THE ROOM OVER THE GARAGE

Muted daylight seeps

through the blinds Gillis
lies on the bed under a
shabby quilt The manu-

of the pages scattered on
the floor He is just
opening his eyes It takes
him a moment to adjust him-
self to the strange sur-
roundings His eyes wander-

stop startled He lifts
himself on one elbow and
stares at -

The heavy chair he had set
against it the night before
has been pushed back The

wears shirt trousers

music - improvisations

theme - not too loud

continuing throughout
the scene)

GILLIS VOICE
That night Id hada
mixed-up dream In it
was an organ grinder
I couldnt see his
face but the organ
was all draped in
black and a chimp was
dancing for pennies
When I opened my eyes
the music was still

there Where was
I
Oh yes in that empty

room over her garage
Only it wasnt empty
any more Somebody
had brought in all my
belongings - my

BIG ROOM NORMA DESMOND S
HOUSE - (DAY)

Gillis sits at an impro-

in front of him working
hard at the manuscript
Pencils shears and a
paste-pot at hand

Facing him at some dis-
tance sits Norma dressed
in another version of her
favorite lounging pajamas
the cigaette contraption
on her finger She is
autographing large photo-
graphs of herself and put-
ting them in envelopes

GILLIS VOICE

So I let him unpack my
things I wanted the
dough and I wanted to
get out of there as
quickly as possible

I thought if I really
got going I could toss
it off in a couple or
weeks But it wasnt

so simple getting some
coherence into that wild
scrambled melodrama
shed concocted What
made it tougher was that
she was around all the
time -- hovering over
me afraid Id do injury
to that precious brain-
child of hers

Gillis takes two or three pages from Normas hand-
written script crosses them out and puts them to

one side

Norma rises crosses towards Gillis

shoulder

NORMA
Whats that

looks over his

Just a scene I cut out

NORMA
What scene

GILLIS

The one where you go to the slave

market

You can cut right to the

scene where John the Baptist -

NORMA
Cut away from me

GILLIS

Honestly its a little old hat
They dont want that any more

NORMA
They dont

Then why do they still

write me fan letters every day
Why do they beg me for my photo-

graphs
me me me

GILLIS
(Resigned)
Okay

Because they want to see
Norma Desmond

He pulls the page from his typewriter As he does
so he glances over towards Norma

On the table in front

of her are the photo-

NORMA AND GILLIS

They sit on a couch facing
the screen On a table in

front of them are champagne

Above their heads are the

typical openings for a pro-

From the opening above

their heads shoots the wide

beam of light

The light of the machine

flickering over his face
which is frozen a somber
enigma

NORMA AND GILLIS

watching the screen
Gillis looks down and sees

that Normas hand is clasp-

doesnt like it much but
he cant do anything about
it However when she for
a second lets go his arm
to pick up a glass of
champagne he gently with-
draws his arm leans away
from her and crosses his
arms to discourage any

resumption of her approach

Norma puts the glass down
doesnt find his arn but

is not aware of any signifi-
cance in his maneuver They

shoves

course Two or three
times a week Max would
haul up that enormous oil
painting that had been
presented to her by some
Nevada Chamber of Com-
merce and wed see a
movie right in her

living room

GILLIS VOICE
So much nicer than going
out shed say The
plain fact was that she
was afraid of that world
outside Afraid it
would remind her that
time had passed

They were silent movies
and Max would run the
projection machine which
was just as well -- it
kept him from giving us
an accompaniment on

that wheezing organ

Shed sit very close to
me and shed smell of
tuberoses which is not
my favorite perfume not
by a long shot Sometines
as we watched shed c
lutch my arm or my hand
forgetting she was my
employer becoming just a
fan excited about that
actress up there on the
screenI guess I dont
have to tell you who the
star was They were
always her pictures --
thats all she wanted

to see

both watch the screen

THE OTHER END OF THE BIG ROOM WITH THE SCREEN

On it flickers a famous scene from one of Normas old
silent pictures It is not to be a funny scene It
is old-fashioned but shows her incredible beauty

and the screen presence which made her the great star
of her day

NORMA AND GILLIS ON THE COUCH

NORMA
Still wonderful isnt it And
no dialogue We didnt need
dialogue We had faces There
just arent any faces like that

and he stops As in the door to the room above
the garage this lock too has been gouged out

around

THE BIG ROOM has been deco-
rated for the occasion with
laurel garlands Dozens of
candles in all the sconces
and candelabra are ablaze
Their flickering flames are
reflected in the waxed sur
face of the tile floor
There is a buffet with
buckets of champagne and
caviar on ice In one corner
on a little platform banked
with palms a four-piece
orchestra is playing

At the buffet are Max and Norma She is drinking
a glass of champagne She is wearing a diamonte
evening dress very high style with long black
gloves and a headdress of paradise feathers Her
eyes fall on Gillis She puts down the glass of
champagne picks up a gardenia boutonniere and
moves toward him

GILLIS
Not on the same floor with
Valentino

NORMA

Just follow me
They start to tango After a moment --

NORMA
Dont bend back like that

GILLIS
Its those feathers They tickle

Norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair
and tosses them away
THE ORCHESTRA
As they play the tango the musicians eye the danc-â€”
ing couple take in the situation exchange glances
and turn away with professional discretion
NORMA AND GILLIS TANGOING
Gillis glances at his wrist watch

NORMA

GILLIS
The other guests

NORMA
There are no other guests We
dont want to share this night

GILLIS
I understand some rich guy bought
up all the tickets for a perfor-
mance at the Metropolitan and sat
there listening to La Traviata
all by himself He was afraid of
catching cold

NORMA
Hold me tighter

GILLIS
Come midnight how about blind-
folding the orchestra and smash-
ing champagne glasses on Maxs
head

NORMA
You think this is all very funny

GILLIS
A little

NORMA
Is it funny that Im in love
with you

GILLIS
Whats that

NORMA
Im in love with you Dont you
know that Ive been in love
with you all along

They dance on Gillis is acutely embarrassed
THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK PANS past the faces
of the musicians who play on with a rather overe-
mphasized lack of interest Finally it winds up

on Max behind the buffet He stands watching Gillis
a faint trace of pity in his eyes

DISSOLVE TO

NORMAS FINGER WITH THE

CIGARETTE GADGET as she GILLIS VOICE

inserts a cigarette Im sure a lot of you will
laugh about this Ridicu-
lous situation wasnt it

arette in the prongs of
that contraption on her
finger

PULL BACK TO

NORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the
cavernous fireplace Norma holds out her cigarette
to Gillis who lights it

NORMA

and brings out a

leather box)

NORMA

(Getting up slowly)
What youre trying to say is
that you dont want me to love

Gillis doesnt answer Norma slaps his face and
rushes from the room and upstairs

Gillis stands paralyzed the slap burning his cheek

THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR
Norma rushes up the last few steps down the corridor
and into her bedroom banging the door MOVE THE

CAMERA toward the closed door centering on the
gouged-out lock

GILLIS IN THE BIG ROOM

He still stands motionless He glances around fur-
tively to see if his humiliation has been observed

THE ORCHESTRA

The musicians are playing away They have turned
their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-
ly for comfort

GILLIS

His eyes move over toward

MAX

He is subtler than the musicians He appears very
busy at the buffet putting empty bottles and used
glasses on a tray He walks across the room with
them

GILLIS

He starts slowly out As he does so his long gold
key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-â€”
ment He yanks it loose and walks with as much
nonchalance as he can muster to

THE HALL

Crossing towards the coat closet Gillis throws a
look upstairs Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from
its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
entrance door He opens the door on the darkness
of the courtyard

EXT DESMOND HOUSE
(NIGHT - RAIN)

Gillis shuts the door GILLISVOICE
He takes a few steps I didnt know where I was
forward then stands going just had to get
for a while breathing out of there I had to be
deep The rain is with people my own age I
balm to that cheek had to hear somebody laugh
where the slap still a again thought of Artie
burns He walks for- Green There was bound to
ward with a great be a New Years shindig
sense of relief going on in his apartment
down on Las Palmas -- the
hock shop set -- not a job
DRIVEWAY LEADING TO in the room but lots of

fun on the cuff

Gillis walks to the
street which is dark
and empty He starts
down Sunset in an
Easterly direction

A car passes He
tries to thumb a

ride without success
However the second

car a florists
delivery wagon stops
Gillis jumps in and the
car drives off

DISSOLVE TO
ARTIE GREENS APARTMENT

It is the most modest one-room affair jam packed
with young people flowing over into the miniature
bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette The only
drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass

bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time
Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters and only
a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
party dress

Abe Burroughs sits at a small guest-festooned piano
and sings Tokio Rose By the door a group of young
men and girls respond to the song by singlng Rinso
White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar
in the manner of a Bach choral Artie Green a dark
haired pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties
is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl

The door behind some of the singers is pushed open

jostling them out of their places In comes Gillis
his hair and face wet the collar of his Vicuna coat
turned up Artie stops conducting but the commer-

cial goes right on

ARTIE
Well what do you know Joe
Gillis

GILLIS
Hi Artie

ARTIE

Where have you been keeping that
gorgeous face of yours

GILLIS
In a deep freeze

ARTIE
I almost reported you to the Bureau
of Missing Persons
(To the company)
Fans you all know Joe Gillis the
well-known screen writer opium
smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect
Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
Artie push their way into the room

ARTIE
Give me your coat

GILLIS
Let it ride for a while

ARTIE
Youre going to stay arent you

GILLIS
That was the general idea

ARTIE
Come on

Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis Its
texture takes his breath away

ARTIE
What is this - mink

He has taken the coat He looks at Gillis standing
there in tails

ARTIE
Judas E Priest who did you
borrow that from Adolphe
Menjou

GILLIS
Close but no cigar

Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the
Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book-
shelf

ARTIE
Say youre not really smuggling
opium these days are you
GILLIS

Wheres the bar

The two make their way toward the punch bowl Its

a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis There
are whistles and stares of astonishlnent at his tails
When they reach the punch bowl Artie picks up a
half-filled glass and fills it
GILLIS
Good party

ARTIE

The greatest They call me the Elsa
Maxwell of the assistant directors

(To some guests who are

dipping their empty cups

into the punch bowl)
Hey easy on the punch bowl Budget
only calls for three drinks per extra
Fake the rest

GILLIS
Listen Artie can I stick around
here for a while

ARTIE
Sure thisll go on all night

GILLIS
mean could you put me up for
a couple of weeks

ARTIE
t just so happens we have a
vacancy on the couch

GILLIS

ARTIE

of your luggage

He runs his finger across the decollete back of a
girl standing in a group next them

ARTIE
Just register here

The girl turns around She is Betty Schaefer

BETTY

Gillis looks at her a little puzzled

BETTY

Hurt feelings department

GILLIS
About that luggage Wheres

ARTIE
Over by the Rainbow Room

Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people

to the telephone which is next to an open door
leading to the bathroom The phone is busy A

girl sits listening to it giggling wildly Another
girl beside her is laughing too They are apparently
sharing a conversation with some man on the other end
of the wire The telephone passes from hand to hand
Gillis watches impatiently then

GILLIS
When youlre through with that
thing can I have it

The girl just nods going on with her chattering
Gillis stands waiting and Betty Schaefer comes up

with his glass

BETTY
You forgot this

GILLIS

GILLIS

They squeeze their way towards the bathroom past
Artie

ARTIE
I said you could have my couch
I didnt say you could have my
girl

BETTY
This is shop talk

She and Gillis go through the open door into
ARTIES BATHROOM

Its a little less noisy although there are some
guests there chatting and having fun Betty and
Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub

GILLIS
Now if I got you correctly there
was a short stretch of my fiction
you found worthy of notice

BETTY
The flashback in the courtroom
when she tells about being a
school teacher

GILLIS
I had a teacher like that once

BETTY
Maybe thats why its good
Its true its moving Now
why dont you use that character

GILLIS
Who wants true Who wants moving

BETTY
Drop that attitude Heres some-
thing really worth while

GILLIS
Want me to start right now
Maybe theres some paper around

BETTY
Im serious Ive got a few ideas

GILLIS
Ive got some ideas myself One
of them being this is New Years
Eve How about living it upa
little

BETTY
As for instance

GILLIS
Well

BETTY
We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta Or should
we just turn on the shower

GILLIS
How about capturing the kitchen
and barricading the door

BETTY
Are you hungry

GILLIS
Hungry After twelve years in
the Burmese jungle I am starving
Lady Agatha -- starving for a
white shoulder --

BETTY

One of the girls who was on the phone comes to

rushes towards the door and out Betty stands look-
ing after him completely bewildered

black stockings rolled down below them The whole
effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume
pretty effectively She points at a leather pour

dive then jumps off

Gillis lolls on a couch watching the performance
very bored

BETTY
This story is about teachers --
their threadbare lives their
struggles Here are people doing
the most important job in the

walks out without looking back

Down the staircase rushes Norma a disordered wild-
ness in the way she moves

NORMA

She hurries after Gillis

PATIO (NIGHT)

Dark except for lights from the house and the
luminousness of the lit pool

Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage He
is carrying the typewriter He doesnt accelerate
his step although he has heard the shot Behind
him Norma comes from the lighted house

NORMA
Youre not leaving me

She shoots twice in rapid succession Gillis drops
the typewriter The shots have swung him around He
is now facing Norma She shoots him This shot

hits him in the belly He doubles up instinctively
backs away from her plummets into the lit pool
Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max
He sees the situation hurries towards Norma who
stands exultant in the strange light from the pool

NORMA
Stars are ageless arent they
