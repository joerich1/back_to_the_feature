LET
THE
DEVIL
OUT

Ryan Jackson 272-6159
BLACK
Like my ex-wifes heart Then
WATER Lots of it An OCEAN

SQUAAAAWWWCK A DIRTY SEAGULL whips by us We follow that
bastard bird

GLIDING over an OIL-BLACKENED SEA
Moving until we come upon the source of this ECO disaster
An OFFSHORE DRILLING PLATFORM

Sticking to the surface of the Pacific like a giant metal
tick

Draining the Earth

Sucking the very life from it
Just like my ex-wife

But enough about that bitch

Because someones running like a madman across the oil rig

EXT CATWALK OIL RIG - DAY

A MAN in a LAB COAT hauls ass across a catwalk
Frightened Covered in blood

From the looks of this guy he’s been through an entire movie
of his own But he just ran into this one

Lab Coat halts at the edge of the platform

Glances back over his shoulder like he’s being followed
Turns his head back toward the ocean

Stands there

Weighing his options

Puts a foot over the lip Pulls it back

Pussy

Suddenly --
Lab Coat SCREAMS OUT Holds his skull like its being
squeezed in a vice Falls to his knees

He reaches for his waist And pulls out a REVOLVER Presses
it to his temple

Wait don’t-

BANG

Shoot

Lab Coat’s brains empty out on the deck

His body timbers to the platform with a THUD
Dead As fuck

TITLE ON BLACK

LET THE DEVIL OUT

SLAM IN

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

A JETFOIL rips across choppy water We RUSH toward the boat
Right toward the windshield and into

INT PILOT HOUSE - DAY

Switches and buttons everywhere Pre-touchscreen tech Need a
manual like a phone book to know what half this shit does

But one guy knows every knob and dial

And that asshole is strapped into the steering column
wrestling with the steering controls

JOHN SANBORN A man who looks like his five o’clock shadow
grew him after a rough night

Late 30s early 40s tops But doesn’t wear it well

Sanborn glances at a radar screen Grabs a two-way radio on
the control console
INT ENGINE ROOM - DAY

The belly of the vessel Hot and cramped Twin turbine
engines RUMBLE kicking out serious horsepower

This is the lair of HARLEY O’HARA Female grease monkey
She can kick your ass And fix your car

Right now she looks like she much rather do the latter

Harley sits on a toolbox in a oil-stained wife beater She
sucks down a cigarette with a scowl on her face

A two-way radio CRACKLES to life in a tool belt slung on her
hip

SANBORN (0S)
(radio filtered)
Harley Tell our passengers were
an hour out

Harley stubs out her butt Grabs the walkie talkie
HARLEY
(into radio)
If I go back there for anything
it’ll be to start throwing punches
SANBORN (0S)
(radio filtered)
There a reason your only option is
physical violence

HARLEY
One of ‘em grabbed my ass
INT PILOT HOUSE - SAME
Sanborn holds the radio

SANBORN
Oh fuck

He sighs Puts the ship in auto pilot

SANBORN (CONTD)
What did you do

INTERCUT
HARLEY
Guess

HARD CUT TO

INT PASSENGER DECK - DAY

WENDELL is a fat bastard With a broken nose Each nostril
stuffed with a blood-soaked tissue

WENDELL
That woman hits like Dyke Tyson
(then)
I think I’m in love

FIVE MEN chuckle around the room including Wendell

KURT Army regulation buzzcut Dog tag necklace Disposition
cloudy with a chance of PTSD Favorite film American Sniper

COOPER Creepy grin Creepier moustache Looks like every guy
on To Catch A Predator Favorite film Peeping Tom

RUSS Close-set eyes Bill Hick’s mullet Owns a truck with
rubber nuts swinging off it Favorite film Road House

JETHRO Missing teeth Prison ink Thinks Bigfoot’s real but
not Obama’s birth Certificate Favorite film Deliverance

Sanborn enters the passenger deck
The five passengers eye him
SANBORN
Listen up Our ETA at the platform
is one hour Now would be a good

time to get your gear ready

WENDELL
That all captain

Sanborn’s eyes fall on Wendell with his broken nose

SANBORN
Yeah

Sanborn turns and heads back toward the pilot house Then
stops

SANBORN (CONTD)
(back turned)
Oh There is one more thing
He turns back around Looks right a Wendell
SANBORN (CONTD)

You touch my engineer again I’1l
strap you to a tow chain throw you
overboard and use you for an
anchor fat man

Beat

Wendell smirks

WENDELL
Sounds fair

That went better than expected
Sanborn turns to leave
WENDELL (CONTD)
(stands)
Where the hell you think you’re
goin’
Guess I spoke too soon
Sanborn turns back around
Wendell walks up to him
WENDELL (CONTD)
You think you can just waltz in
here threaten me and leave
SANBORN
I wasn’t threatening you I was
letting you know how things work on
my ship
Beat
The two men stare each other down
WENDELL
You wanna know what I think about
your ship
Wendell HOCKS and spits a bloody loogie on Sanborn
Sanborn looks at the loogie dripping down his shirt

He looks back up at Wendell Expressionless Then --

WHAM Sanborn drives his forehead into Wendell’s broken

nose
Wendell goes down like he got hit by a sniper
The other men LEAP from where they’re sitting
They immediately surround Sanborn
Onto ‘em like flies to shit
Uh-oh
JETHRO
Youre gonna wish you hadn’t done
that mister
SANBORN
Whoa Whoa Whoa Now just hold up
He started it

Wendell cries in a heap on the floor holding his flattened
nose Man I hate to see a fat man cry

KURT
And we’re gonna finish it

GATES (0C)
No you’re not

Sanborn and the four men turn and see --

GATES Corporate reptile Cold blooded All business
Favorite film (tie) Wolf Of Wall Street and American Psycho

GATES (CONT’D)
Stand down

Wendell pulls himself off the floor Blubbering Blood
running over his lips and chin A fucking mess

WENDELL
That sonuvabitch smashed my nose
GATES
Did you all forget why it is we’re
here
Beat
KURT

You can’t expect us to just let
this guy get away with what he did
to Wendell
GATES
So clearly you have forgotten
Allow me to remind you Youre
here ALL of you are here for one
reason And that reason is to serve
the interest of the company

KURT
But I don’t think that-

GATES
That’s right You don’t think
That’s my job You and your
colleagues are the containment
team You’re being compensated
handsomely for this Your job is to
clean up a mess It’s not to go
creating one aboard this ship
Beat
No one says anything Until --
KA-CHAK
HARLEY (0C)
Drop your cocks and reach for your
socks
The men in the hold look across the room to see
Harley
With A GUN THE SIZE OF GOD’S DICK trained on ‘em
More specifically a Benelli shotgun
Everyone stands motionless
HARLEY (CONTD)
(to Sanborn)

Why don’t you come over here John

Sanborn shrugs works for me Makes his way across the deck
walking between Kurt and Jethro

SANBORN
(fuck you)
Excuse me

He joins Harley on the other side of the room

SANBORN (CONT’D)
Hey
HARLEY
Hey yourself

Harley turns her attention back to the passengers

HARLEY (CONTD)
We have a problem here Fellas

GATES
No Ms OHara I think everyone has
came to an understanding In fact
Wendell was just about to come find
you and apologize for his behavior
earlier

Gates stares a hole through Wendell

GATES (CONT’D)
Weren’t you

GATES (CONT’D)
Yes

Beat

GATES (CONT’D)
Well Let’s not keep the lady
waiting

WENDELL
I uh Wanted uh To uh Say
uh I apologize For uh ya
know Grabbin’ your uh ass
Nice uh-pology
HARLEY
(deadpan)
Wow

Beat

HARLEY (CONTD)
That was

Pathetic Half-assed Incoherent

HARLEY (CONT’D (CONTD)
In English

Beat
It was Kind of

GATES
Pardon Wendell’s lack of eloquence
He’s

A moron Half-wit Dipshit

SANBORN
An asshole

GATES
Frankly yes But men like him
serve a purpose

Gates looks at a gold Rolex on his wrist
GATES (CONTD)
With that said we need to prep for
our arrival
(to the men)
Head to the cargo hold gentlemen

The five men throw glares over their shoulder at Sanborn and
Harley as they exit toward the cargo hold

Gates follows his subordinates out
Harley lowers her shotgun once they’ve gone

SANBORN
Lucky them you came along

HARLEY
Lucky them

SANBORN
Yeah You saved them from the
beating my face was gonna give
their fists
Harley smirks

CUT TO

INT CARGO HOLD

FEET are slid into rubber boots connected to plastic
leggings

ZZZIIIIIPPP Bodies are sealed into suits

Helmets are pulled down over heads

Gates and his five man crew stand suited up head-to-toe in
white plastic suits Tiny speakers are situated just below
their polycarbonate FACE SHIELDS

They’re dressed like they’re about to enter ground zero of a
contagious outbreak Or cook meth on the moon

Kurt and Wendell lumber across the hold over to two black
Pelican cases Unsnap the latches on each box Pop the lids
revealing MP5 SUBMACHINE GUNS
Not the kind of gear you bring to clean up an oil spill
Gates carries an aluminum briefcase across the room
GATES
(re Guns)
Keep those out of sight until we
board the rig

Gates takes a knee setting the case on the floor Opens it

We can’t see what’s inside but a pulsing red glow emits from
it Gates smiles satisfied Shuts it

Gates pulls handcuffs Snaps one bracelet to the briefcase’s
handle Clamps the other bracelet around his wrist

CUT TO

A RADAR SCREEN

The Jetfoil -- as represented by a CIRCULAR GREEN BLIP
because modern radar screens still look like a shitty Atari
game -- moves toward a LARGER GREEN BLIP on a raster display
INT PILOT HOUSE - DAY

Sanborn’s eyes go up from the radar screen to the front deck

Harley sits strapped into the copilot seat looking through a
pair of binoculars

HARLEY’S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

The OIL PLATFORM stands in the ocean Black oil snaking from
it like inky tentacles Grabbing for us

Harley lowers the binoculars
HARLEY

Something’s off about this whole

thing

SANBORN
Like what

HARLEY

For starters why hire us instead
of taking a skimmer out to the
site And why take such a small
crew to clean up such a giant

spill
Sanborn shrugs

HARLEY (CONTD)

And there’s got to be a large crew
aboard a rig that size You’re not
the least bit curious why there’s
been no attempt to contact them

SANBORN
Nope

HARLEY

Come on You know this is sketchy

SANBORN

Listen Harley I need the money
I’ve just been through a divorce
that left me with little else but
the clothes on my back All that
matters is that check cleared

Anything else Don’t care
Gates enters the pilot house

GATES

Mr Sanborn has the right attitude

about things

Sanborn and Harley glance back at Gates who stands in his

plastic suit

GATES (CONTD)

But to ease your mind this is no
different than any other spill

clean up effort

Harley unbuckles from her seat and gets up Looks Gates up

and down Notes the briefcase handcuffed to Gates’

wrist
Liar

HARLEY
Wanna know what I think looking at
you standing here I think there’s
something aboard that rig Maybe a
contagious disease or virus

GATES
Why would you think something that

HARLEY
Because you’re dressed like an
astronaut on his way to visit the
planet Ebola

GATES
This is a standard hazardous
material suit

HARLEY
That’s funny I don’t remember any
of the workers who helped with the
BP spill in get ups like yours

GATES
(smiles )
Very perceptive The suit is just a
precaution Just to safe

SANBORN
(over his shoulder)

Hey Gates That stuff I said a
minute ago about not wanting to
know anything I changed my mind I
wanna know if there’s something on
that rig that we need to worry
about

Gates gaze goes toward the window to the oil rig in the

distance

GATES
(staring at the rig)
No You have nothing to worry
about

Sanborn and Harley share a look They’re not reassured

GATES (CONT’D)
(looks away from rig)
Well I just wanted to check on our
progress I see we are on schedule
Ill leave you to your task

Gates exits the pilot house to go back to the cargo hold
Harley sits back down Eyes Sanborn
HARLEY
Well Now what do you think about
this whole thing
SANBORN
I’m thinking that my Grandma was a
mind reader in a traveling circus
so I know clowns when I see ‘em
And I think those clowns he brought
along are private security
contractors

HARLEY
You mean like Blackwater

SANBORN
Yeah An outfit similar to that
More or less

Harley grabs a CB radio mic

HARLEY
I’m gonna try and radio-

BOOOOOM THE ENTIRE SHIP SHUDDERS

Sanborn and Harley are shook in their seats

PASSAGEWAY

Gates goes ass-over-teacups in the corridor leading toward
the cargo hold

CARGO HOLD

The Containment Team is slammed to the deck

PILOT HOUSE

RED WARNING LIGHTS flash on the NAV console in front of
Sanborn

HARLEY
What the fuck was that

Sanborn locks down the steering and runs out with Harley

PASSAGEWAY

Sanborn and Harley tear ass into the passageway Gates is
still on the floor

SANBORN
(keeps running)
No time to lay around Gates

Gates pulls himself off the floor

Sanborn and Harley sprint down the corridor into

THE CARGO HOLD

Bounding through the hold past Wendell and crew as they pull
themselves off the deck

WENDELL
(calling after them)
Whatd we hit
They offer no answer because fuck him And they don’t know
Sanborn and Harley just continue racing into

THE ENGINE ROOM

Sanborn comes running into the smoke filled engine room
followed by Harley

Fire rages out of the two engines The hull is breached
Water sprays into the room through jagged fissures

Harley grabs a fire extinguisher Sprays over the flames
Puts out the blaze One of two engines fucked beyond repair

Gates and his men march in the engine room

GATES
What happened
SANBORN
Not sure yet But I have my

theories

Sanborn grabs a handheld net skimmer off the wall Marches
back toward the way he entered

GATES
Where are you going

SANBORN
Up top
INT ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The HUSK OF A METALLIC SPHERE is dropped on the floor

GATES (0C)
What is that

Sanborn Harley Gates and his crew stand circled around
the object

SANBORN
It’s a sea mine

HARLEY
Why would there be sea mines near
an oil rig

Sanborn and Harley look to Gates Waiting for an answer

GATES
I haven’t the faintest idea

SANBORN
Why don’t I believe you

Because he’s lying

GATES
Not sure what you’re suggesting

Yeah you are

WENDELL
Fuck all that How is it we aren’t
blown up right now

SANBORN
Luck We didn’t hit the mine

Huh

KURT
Then what did

SANBORN
My guess A fish Maybe a fucking
shark for all I know Whatever it
was it’s fish sticks now

HARLEY
The bigger question is how many
more mines are out there

SANBORN
No telling But you gotta assume
weve sailed into a mine field

GATES
This complicates things

SANBORN
No It simplifies them The clean
up effort is over We’re gonna
patch up the hull and limp our way
back home with one engine

GATES

That’s not satisfactory I’m afraid
SANBORN

I don’t give a shit It ain’t up

for debate

Gates trades looks with his crew

And it’s now that we notice they all have white duffle bags
on their shoulders

GATES
I’m sorry but

Gates signals with a nod

Wendell Kurt Cooper Jethro and Russ reach into their
duffles and each pull out an M5 machine gun Train them on
Sanborn and Harley

Fuck

GATES (CONTD)
I have a schedule to keep

Wendell grins at Sanborn

WENDELL
Go head Give me an excuse
SANBORN
(to Gates)

I don’t know what’s on that rig or
why you want to get it so bad but
you’re gonna get us blown up before
you ever get to it

GATES

We’re less than four hundred yards

outside the platform We’ll go slow

and keep our eyes open
EXT PACIFIC OCEAN - LATER
The Jetfoil inches its way toward the oil rig
BRAAAP BRAAAP BRAAAP
Jethro and Russ shoot at the water from the deck
The crazy bastards are trying to set off mines that might lie
ahead

INT PILOT HOUSE - SAME

Sweat forms on Sanborn’s brow as he pilots the ship through
the water

SANBORN
This is insane

Harley sits next to him riding copilot Watches Jethro and
Russ fire into the sea on the foredeck

HARLEY
If they hit a mine there’s no
guarantee it won’t kill us We
didn’t hit the last one it took out
one of our engines

Gates stands behind them holding Harley’s shotgun Wendell
Mike and Cooper flank his sides gripping machine guns

GATES
Have faith
EXT OIL RIG - MINUTES LATER
Miraculously the Jetfoil has reached the platform and not
been blown up The ship sits moored to the rig
INT CARGO HOLD - SAME TIME
Sanborn and Harley stand guns at their backs in the hold

Gates paces as he gives everyone the rundown

GATES
Once we’re aboard you all know the
drill We proceed right to main
deck level We secure the site and
the payload

What does he mean payload

SANBORN
Just what exactly is it we’re here
for

GATES

The only thing you need to know is
that youll be coming along with
us The both of you So make sure
you stay out of the way and do as
instructed when instructed

HARLEY
If we’re going with you where are
our biosuits If you need ‘em we
need ‘em

SANBORN
Harley’s right You guys are going
up there in human tupperware
containers You expect us to go
with our dicks in our hand

GATES
Of course not Mike give them
something to wear

Kurt tosses them two N95 surgical masks The ones Asian
people wear in public and still get Bird Flu

HARLEY
You gotta be fucking kidding me

He’s not

EXT OIL RIG - DAY

Sanborn and Harley wear the surgical masks as a rack and
pinion lift carries the eight of them up side of the oil rig
EXT CATWALK OIL RIG - DAY

Gates leads them off the derrick elevator onto the catwalk
Where they’re greeted by

Lab Coat’s dead body Well not really greeted because he’s a
corpse But you know what I mean

HARLEY
Oh my god

SANBORN
Alright That can’t be a good

Everyone glances down at the body Gates kneels next to it
Examines the exit wound on the side of the dead man’s head

GATES
Gunshot to the head

No shit
Gates picks up the revolver laying next to the body

GATES (CONTD)
Suicide

No shit

GATES (CONT’D)
Not much we can do for him

This guy should change his name to Captain No Shit
Gates stands Passes the revolver to Kurt

GATES (CONTD)
Let’s keep moving

The group heads toward the bridge on the first level deck

INT BRIDGE (FIRST LEVEL) - MOMENTS LATER

A control room The nerve center of the rig Should be a hive
of activity in this place But it’s dead quiet

SEVERAL LARGE MONITORS hang on the wall Displaying sea floor
topography and strange looking system schematics Beneath
that

a COMMAND CONSOLE with marine radar screens stretches the
length of the room

But fuck all that because what’s really got our attention is
the

HEADLESS BODY slumped back in a swivel chair BLOOD pooled
beneath it like red soup With TEETH floating in it

Plus an Ear Gross

And those ‘strange looking schematics’ on the monitors upon
closer look pretty sure some of it’s BRAINS

Now that I’m looking at it is that A NOSE stuck to a
radar screen at the console Yep It definitely is

In fact everything is splattered with what useta be the head
atop the body

On the walls

On the control board

Drip

We look up

On the ceiling

Jeeze it’s like the guy’s head just exploded

The door to the room BANGS open

We whip around to see Gates lead the group inside the room

Everyone stops a few feet in Eyes all staring ahead at the
headless body in the chair

Jethro says what we’ve been thinking

JETHRO
Oh fuck

That pretty much sums it up
Harley looks away in disgust

HARLEY
My god

Sanborn just stares trying to wrap his mind around what he’s
seeing

Gates grip tightens around the briefcase he’s holding As if
the fact that its cuffed to his wrist isn’t enough

GATES
Let’s keep moving And keep an eye
out

Gates takes a step

SQUISH
Looks down Lifts his foot revealing

A squashed EYEBALL with the optic nerve still attached to it
like a tail

He did say keep an- you know what Forget it Too easy

WENDELL
(looking down at floor)
Is that a fucking eyeball

COOPER
(looking down at floor)
Yeah
(beat)
A blue one

Russ vomits inside his helmet Which isn’t as gross as what’s
before them But almost

Jethro scrunches his face in disgust at Russ

JETHRO
Hell man Pull yourself together

RUSS
I’m fine

Like hell you are

SANBORN
This is fucked We haven’t even
been on this rig five minutes and
weve already came across two dead
bodies

COOPER
We can make it a nice even number
if ya like How’s three bodies
sound

SANBORN
Three doesn’t sound like an even
number dipshit

Cooper sticks his gun in Sanborn’s back

COOPER
Whatcha call me

GATES
Enough

Cooper backs off
GATES (CONTD)
We’ve got a job to do still And
were doing it

Gates kicks the eyeball across the floor Then marches on
through the room

Everyone follows behind him

As the group passes the headless body they try to not look
at it

But can’t help themselves

Neither can we

It ain’t any prettier close up

Russ looks like he might vomit again Manages not to

Life’s about the small victories

INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS
A long hallway Doors on either side All of them wide open

Kurt at the front of the group follows his gun down the
corridor

The group walks by the rig crew’s living quarters
Looking in the doors as they pass

The rooms little more than glorified walk-in closets
Each one furnished the same as the last

Not a single living soul in any of ‘em

Or dead person

Thankfully

WENDELL
Nobody’s home

COOPER
Looks like they left in a hurry

SANBORN
Maybe we should take after their
lead

WENDELL

Maybe you should shut the fuck up
SANBORN

I’m startin’ to feel like my

opinion isn’t valued by you guys

WENDELL
Keep it up smart ass

Sanborn mouths two words silently Blow And Me
The group reaches a door at the end of the hallway
GATES
(re door)
This should take us straight to the

mess hall

Kurt opens the door and walks through Followed by Gates
Russ Wendell Jethro Sanborn Harley and Coop-

KaBump

The fuck was that

Cooper stops at the threshold
He listens

KaBump

It’s faint

Cooper turns around Stares at the last room at the end of
the hallway

KaBump

There it is again Definitely came from that room Whatever
it is

COOPER
The hell

Cooper heads toward the room to investigate

INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

The group heads toward a set of double doors at the far end
of the corridor

GATES
We may encounter crew in the mess
hall So be ready

The armed men switch from semi to full auto

Sanborn bringing up the rear notices Cooper’s no longer
behind him as he walks

SANBORN
Hey Where’s that asshole

Harley and Jethro turn to see what Sanborn’s talking about

JETHRO
Goddam it
(to rest of group)
HOLD UP

The rest of the group stops and looks back at Jethro

JETHRO (CONTD)
Coop went off wanderin’ again

RUSS
Again

GATES
What Why would he do that

Kurt sighs
KURT
Coop has a tendency to go explorin’
and not tell anyone he’s doin’ it

WENDELL
(calls out)
COOP

Beat

WENDELL (CONTD)
COOP YA DUMB SHIT

No answer

Gates is starting to get agitated

GATES
I’m starting to get agitated
There’s a SCREAM
One guess whose

KURT
Cooper

Bingo

The group takes off back towards the living quarters

INT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Were in a room

Staring straight out its open door into the hall
Watching Sanborn and Harley as they run in

They stop a few steps inside of the doorway

Eyes on the floor in front of them

Jethro Wendell and Russ spill through the door right after
waving guns

Halt in their tracks next to Sanborn and Harley
They stare down at something or someone off screen
One guess who
WENDELL
(looking at floor)
Coop
Bingo
We don’t see ‘em But it must be bad because --
Russ starts gagging Which is no real surprise

Maybe he’s not the best barometer

GATES (0C)
Out of the way

Gates marches into the room with Kurt parting the others
GATES (CONTD)
Where is-
(looks down)
He
Gates peers down Face impenetrable

Kurt on the other hand has to look away Repulsed by the
sight Or upset Most likely both

We swing around behind ‘em to look in at
Cooper

Dead on the floor

White bio-suit splattered in blood

Helmet cracked wide open

With no head inside

Only a spurting neck stump

Brains all over the top and bottom of the bunk bed
Jawbone on a pillow

The rest of his cranium decorates the room

Not very Feng shui

Wendell asks what everyone’s asking themselves

WENDELL
Who did this

HARLEY
More like what did this

Beat

WENDELL
Hell you mean tits

HARLEY
What I mean bigger tits is
whatever did this it wasn’t a
person

Beat

WENDELL
So then what happened You think he
ate some Pop Rocks and drank a
goddam Coke

SANBORN
Jeezus What She’s sayin’ is
whatever did this might be the
reason your wearin’ that spaceman
suit

JETHRO
She’s right Wendell

Really
Everyone looks at Jethro

JETHRO (CONTD)
You do have bigger tits

He does But that’s besides the fucking point

WENDELL
(sincere as fuck)
Now ain’t the time for fat shaming

Beat

SANBORN
Fat fuck is right

WENDELL
I’m gonna fuckin’ shoot you

SANBORN
(ignores Wendell)
Right now we need to figure out
what the Hell is goin’ on
(looks at Gates)
And somethin’ tells me you know

All eyes are on Gates

GATES
The particulars of the job are ona
need to know basis Any privileged
information certainly wouldn’t be
divulged to you and your engineer

Is this guy serious right now

SANBORN
What about your men They sound
like they’re in the dark as well
Good question

And Wendell Russ Jethro and Kurt are clearly listening
Waiting for Gates’ response

GATES
They’re well aware of the nature of
the job they were hired for They
also were made aware of its
dangers
None of them like that answer Especially Wendell
He gets in Gates personal space
WENDELL
You’re right We knew what we were
gettin’ into But there’s some
things you ain’t tell us And
seein’ Coop like like this I’m
think’n you owe us some ans-
Bump
Everyone freezes
What was that
Sounds like it came from
WENDELL (CONTD)
(turns from Gates)
Coop
Everybody looks down at Cooper’s body again

Yeah From there

But he ain’t moving

VOICE (0C)
(whispered)
Shit
That came from-
SANBORN

Under the bed

Yeah

Wendell Kurt Jethro and Russ aim their guns at the bed

They watch the bottom bunk

KURT
Who’s there

Beat
No answer

KURT (CONTD)
I SAID WHOS THERE

Beat

Still nothing

WENDELL

I say we shoot the shit outta the

goddam bed
JETHRO

Me too Best not to take chances
KURT

Alright Fuck it Let’s blast it
VOICE (0C)

(from under the bed)
WAIT
Beat

KURT

You have five seconds to show
yourself Or you’re dead

VOICE
(from under the bed)
Alright I’m comin’ out
KURT
Crawl out hands first Real fucking
slow
TWO HANDS slide out from under the bed
Followed by a HEAD
Wearing some sorta gnarly ass METAL HELMET

Like MAGNETO wears from X-Men

MAGNETO MAN crawls the rest of his way out from the bed

KURT (CONTD)
Stand up slow and reach for Jesus

Magneto Man rises hands held above his head

Looks to be in his early 30’s Rail thin A buck twenty
Soakin’

A white LAB COAT WET WITH BLOOD drapes his bony frame
Magneto Man stares at the gun barrels in his face

MAGNETO MAN
Are you guys from Weyland

WENDELL
Well ask the questions shit heel

MAGNETO MAN
Okay

KURT
Let’s start with what did you do to
our friend

Magneto Man looks puzzled by the question He looks down at
Coopers headless body

MAGNETO MAN
You think I did this to him

CLANG
Wendell’s gun stock crashes against his metal helmet

MAGNETO MAN (CONT’D)
Ow

WENDELL
I told you we’ll ask the questions

MAGNETO MAN
(rubs side of his helmet)
Alright Alright

KURT
Answer the question

MAGNETO MAN
No I didn’t kill your friend

JETHRO
Bullshit

MAGNETO MAN
How would I be able to something
like that Does it look like I’d be
capable of doing that

Not really
CLANG
Wendell butts him over the helmet again

WENDELL
I said no questions Next time I’ma
take that stupid helmet off before
I hit you

MAGNETO MAN
(rubs helmet)
Okay Jeeze

Gates steps forward

GATES
I’1l take the Q and A from here
gentlemen

Wendell reluctantly backs off
Magneto Man and Gates look at each other

GATES (CONT’D)
I’m going to ask you some
questions I want you to answer
them as succinct and accurate as
you can Can you do that

MAGNETO MAN
Yes

GATES
Are you a scientist

MAGNETO MAN
Yes

Sanborn and Harley share a look what the hell is going on
GATES

What’s your level of security
clearance
MAGNETO MAN
Top secret But most of the crew on
the rig has top secret clearance
GATES
How many others are alive aboard
the platform

MAGNETO MAN
I don’t know

SANBORN
Ask him why he was hiding

Gates turns and glares at Sanborn Nods to Wendell
Wendell drives his gun stock into Sanborn’s stomach
Oof

Sanborn drops to a knee

Harley crouches next to Sanborn

HARLEY
(looks up at Wendell)
Bastard
Wendell grins
WENDELL

Been waitin’ to do that

Gates returns to his questioning of Magneto Man

GATES
Is the bio wing on the second
level
MAGNETO MAN
Yes
GATES
Good
(then)

Tell me why were you hiding

MAGNETO MAN
I didn’t know what else to do We
lost control Crew members started
dying I was fleeing for my life
Then I heard you guys and thought
you might be

GATES
Might be who Did some one else
board this rig

MAGNETO MAN

Who do you think Man I knew the
company wasn’t aware of all the
details of what was going on but I
never realized they’d be this in
the dark Unless

(dawns on him)
Youre not from Weyland Oil

Gates shakes his head

MAGNETO MAN (CONT’D)
Youre from the CDC then

Gates shakes his head

MAGNETO MAN (CONT’D)
Then who are you

GATES
Were corporate raiders In the
most literal sense

Magneto Man studies Gates for a beat He LAUGHS in his face

GATES (CONTD)
Is there something funny

MAGNETO MAN

What’s funny is that you’re all
fools You have no idea what you’re
dealing with Look at yourselves
You think bio-suits or surgical
masks will keep you safe

(points to Coopers body)
Did it help him

Harley helps Sanborn back to his feet

HARLEY
What’s he talkin’ about Gates

MAGNETO MAN
(to Harley)
I’1l tell you what I’m talking
about You’re not dealing with some
run-of-the-mill weaponized virus on
this rig It’s a-

BANG
Magneto Man looks down at a quarter-sized hole in
He looks up at Gates Shock frozen on his face

Gates holds a smoking revolver The same revolver
Lab Coat’s body

Magneto Man drops to the floor Dead
Everyone stands stunned Until finally --

HARLEY
You murdered him in cold blood

GATES
Don’t be so dramatic It was
necessary He was infected And
somehow he managed to infect
Cooper That’s how he died

Sanborn ain’t buying it

SANBORN
First you tell us this is a typical
clean up mission Then you say
there’s no contagion on this rig
Now you claim that guy was
infected I’m sensing a pattern of
deception here

GATES
Full disclosure What’s aboard this
rig is a biological weapon One
that’s highly volatile in nature
But we’ve taken the proper
precautions We’re safe

Yeah right

SANBORN
We want off this rig Gates

GATES
The faster we retrieve our payload
The faster we can get off the rig

his chest

he took off

Jethro kneels by Coopers body and picks up the dead man’s
MP5 Slings it over his back by the shoulder strap Stands

JETHRO
Sounds like we should get movin’
then

CUT TO

INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
The group files down the corridor Like a Bataan death march
Heading towards the double doors at its other end

Kurt is at the front again Gun up Serious as dick cancer

INT MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER
The crew enters a- What the

KURT
Fuck

It’s a mess hall

And what’s in here folks is definitely a MESS

That’s puttin’ it lightly

There’s SIX DEAD BODIES All missing heads

The place looks like a school cafeteria after a food fight
With fucking Hannibal Lector

Wall-to-wall BRAINS

Fava beans

Seriously There’s a blood stained sign that says

Lunch Special
Fava Bean And Fresh Corn Succotash

Which sounds disgusting
Even in a room with a half dozen corpses with exploded heads

The group looks up down left and right as they walk
through the mess hall

Their boots - SquinchSqwatchSquinch - in the gore beneath
them

SANBORN
Holy hell

Even Gates looks shaken up

RUSS
Jesus

Harley crosses herself She’s not even religious

Wendell picks up an EAR with a hoop earring in it from a bowl
of Wheaties on a table

WENDELL
Leave Jesus the fuck outta this
(holds up ear)
He ain’t listenin’

He drops the ear back in the bowl

JETHRO
I’ve seen some shit in my time
But this this takes the goddam

donut
Russ blinks sweat out his eyes He seems dazed on his feet

JETHRO (CONTD)

(to Russ)
You ain’t gettin’ sick again are
you
RUSS

I’m alright
You don’t look it

JETHRO
If you do I ain’t judgin’

RUSS

I’m fine It’s just my dam ears

won’t stop ringin’ and it’s drivin’

me up a fuckin’ tree
INSIDE RUSS’S HELMET
We are looking at Russ’s left ear Blood trickles from it
The VEIN on his temple THROBS
As the blood vessel pulsates - we start to hear Russ’s heart
beat - ThumpThump - Get louder - ThumpThump - And louder -
ThumpThump - until it dominates our ears and carries over to
THE MESS HALL
The CEILING LIGHTS START TO FLICKER like it’s an EDM party

ThumpThump
Everyone looks up at the flashing bulbs

Thump

Thump
Drops
Thump

Grabs

Thump

Russ grimaces in pain

Thump
his gun
Thump

his helmet

Thump

Thump

SCREEEEEEAAAAAMS

Everyone turns to look at Russ and

We see HIS ENTIRE HELMET ERUPT a second before --

The fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling BURST and the entire
mess hall goes totally --

BLACK

We hear a WET MEATY THUD against the floor

Beat

Then

Beat

OVER BLACKNESS

KURT (0C)
RUSS

No answer No surprise

KURT (0C) (CONTD)

RUSS You alright

No he’s not Clearly

HARLEYN (0C)

No he’s not alright What the fuck
was that His head just it

just

SANBORN (0C)
It fuckin’ exploded

KURT (0C)
You don’t know what the hell you
saw The lights blew immediately

SANBORN (0C)
Then why isn’t he answering

Because he can’t without a head
JETHRO (0C)
It happened fast But I saw what
they saw Kurt
WENDELL (0C)
Fuck all this Right now none us
can see shit
GATES (0C)
Everyone calm down These rigs have
auxiliary lights that should cut on
any moment
On cue AUXILIARY LIGHTS SNAP ON Casting the mess hall in an
ominous RED HUE As if it wasn’t fucking ominous enough
already
Everyone stands where they were before the lights went out
Except Russ
His body lays in a heap on the floor
And they all move in for a look

His helmet is nothing but a shattered shell

What’s left of his head which isn’t a whole hell of a lot
resembles smashed meat loaf

First to react is Jethro Shakes his head

JETHRO
This ain’t even close to natural

No shit

WENDELL
I ain’t sign up for this shit

Sanborn looks at Gates Pulls down his surgical mask
SANBORN

How high are you gonna let the body
count climb Gates

GATES
What are you doing Pull your mask
back up

SANBORN

Clearly those you have on suits
offer no protection so what good
is a bird flu mask
Sanborn rips the mask off completely Flings it to the floor

HARLEY
Fuck this bull shit

Harley follows his lead Takes off her mask Throws it down

GATES
That wasn’t wise
JETHRO
No Gates They’re right It’s all

useless

Jethro disconnects a re-breather hose on the back of his
suit

GATES
What are you doing

JETHRO
What’s it look like

Jethro detaches his helmet’s seals Then pulls it off

GATES
Do you realize you’re exposing
yourself

JETHRO

I’1l take my chances

Wendell and Kurt swap glances Nod to each other And both
detach their helmets and remove them

They all stand sans masks and helmets staring at Gates
An act of solidarity An act of mutiny

GATES
You’re all being foolish

SANBORN
What’s foolish is not gettin’ off
this rig Right now

WENDELL
He’s right I don’t much like the
guy But he’s right

JETHRO
Hafta agree

KURT
That makes three of us

GATES
We have to secure the payload

SANBORN
Enough of your bullshit Gates
Were leavin’

Sanborn walks off Harley follows
Kurt Wendell and Jethro also start to leave

GATES
Our only hope of getting out of
this alive is on the bio wing

Everyone keeps walking

GATES (CONT’D)
We must assume we have all been
infected Whether you die on your
way to the boat or you die an hour
later as you’re sailing off Our
fate is sealed

They all stop Trade looks is he full of shit
Yes But he might be right

GATES (CONT’D)
I’m going to be totally transparent
about everything This isn’t an
offshore drilling rig It operates
like one for appearance purposes
But that’s just a cover

HARLEY
Yeah No shit

GATES
This place is a private defense
research facility This bit of
information Kurt Wendell and
Jethro already know
Sanborn looks at the three men

KURT
He’s tellin’ the truth about that

GATES
What they don’t know is what
exactly we came to acquire

HARLEY
You mean steal

GATES
In franker terms yes All they
knew is it was a biological weapon

SANBORN
What exactly is it

GATES
I’m not even completely sure What
I do know is that it’s a weapon
that acts like an airborne
contagion but one with the
capability to be targeted

SANBORN
Like a biological drone
GATES
Yes
SANBORN
That makes its target’s head
explode
GATES

Yes But unlike drones there’s zero
collateral damage

Sanborn puts his arms out

SANBORN
This looks like a shit load of
collateral damage to me

GATES
Which further helps the point I’m
making For an unforeseen reason
protocols weren’t followed and
created an outbreak situation
aboard this facility So now anyone
who’s set foot on this rig has been
exposed

SANBORN
Still waitin’ for you to make your
point

GATES
My point is we will be amongst the
collateral damage With certainty
Especially seeing that this
contagion is so virulent not even
traditional safe guards like
protective gear can keep one safe

JETHRO
I ain’t by no means the most
learned man But it sounds to me
like youre sayin’ we’re screwed

In simple terms yes

GATES
Yes But we know this weapon be it
a virus or bacteria is
controllable if it’s able to be
targeted So the way we save our
own asses is by securing it and all
of the data they have on it The
more we know about it the more
likely we can protect ourselves
from it

The group absorbs this
A long beat
Then --

SANBORN
Yeah I think we’1ll take our
chances
(looks to others)
What do guys think

EVERYONE
Yeah

The five of them start to leave

GATES
If I can’t convince you with the
very real likelihood of your own
deaths let me appeal to your
altruistic sides

They all stop

Even though I’m sure Wendell or Jethro have no idea what
altruistic means

GATES (CONTD)
If you get off this rig and manage
to stay alive long enough to get
back to civilization This agent
youve been exposed to could infect
and kill millions You’ve seen what
it can do You would let the Devil

out
He’s right
Dammit
SANBORN
You know you could be entirely
wrong
GATES
Are you willing to risk me being
right

CUT TO

EXT OIL RIG - OVERCAST

Sanborn and Harley march out the rig heading back to their
boat

SANBORN
Let’s get the hell off this rig

Guess altruism is dead
But they aren’t Yet

Kurt Wendell and Jethro lumber out right behind them
seconds after

WENDELL
(shouts to Sanborn)
Hope you can get that boat goin’
before we die chief

Harley looks over at Sanborn

HARLEY
(sotto)
Do we have to bring them back with
us

SANBORN
(sotto)
They’ve got guns So yeah
(then)
Maybe we can suffocate Wendell
Blame it on sleep apnea

Gates comes jogging to the platform last Now with his helmet
off

GATES
(yelling after them)
You can’t go
All of them ignore him
GATES (CONT’D)
You’re wasting valuable time We
have to get the weapon
JETHRO
(not turning around)
Get it yourself
Gates raises the revolver
BANG
Fires it into the air
That gets their attention
Sanborn and Harley turn around
Kurt Wendell and Jethro whirl Guns up
Gates stands holding the gun towards the sky
GATES
Easy now gentlemen Listen to

reason You’re not safe just
because you leave the platform

Was that a threat

WENDELL
Gates I’m tellin’ you there ain’t
no way we’re goin’ back in that
rig

KURT
He’s right about that And hearing
you go on and on is starting to
give me a fuckin’ headache

Educated guess the cause of Kurt’s headache ain’t Gates
Because blood has begun leaking from Kurt’s ear canals
Kurt hasn’t noticed yet No one has
SANBORN
Nobody’s buyin’ what you’re sellin’

anymore Gates

Kurt touches the wetness leaking from his ear Pulls his hand
away Sees the blood He doesn’t even have time to react

HIS HEAD DETONATES IN A CLOUD OF RED MIST IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (brain juice) PIECES OF SKULL SCRAPS OF
FLESH and BLOOD SLIME RAINS DOWN

Everyone tries to cover up

But it’s useless

They all get showered in GOOP

Wendell and Jethro get the worst of it

Kurt’s body drops to its knees Falls forward to the deck
with a SMACK

Nobody says anything for a long

Awkward

Beat

Then --

SQUAAAAWWWCK

SPLAT A seagull shits on Kurt’s headless corpse from above
Beat

Gates calmly walks across the deck to Kurt’s body tucks the
pistol he’s holding kneels down picks up Kurt’s MP5 and
stands

Gates stares at the rest of the group Says nothing

He doesn’t have to

SLAM TO

FIVE SETS OF BOOTS

March IN HASTE across the control room--
Trample back through the living quarters--
Stomp down the hallway--

Squash over the mess in the mess hall--

INT WHO THE FUCK KNOWS - MOMENTS LATER

A door SWINGS open and Sanborn Harley Jethro Wendell and
Gates walk inside

We orbit around to look in with ‘em We’re in --
A MOVIE THEATER

Barcolounger seating

Just large enough to not be a screening room
And completely empty

Blame it on online piracy

Or that everyone’s dead on the rig

A film is projected digitally from the ceiling onto a large
movie screen across the room The 1988 remake of The Blob

ON THE MOVIE SCREEN

Shawnee Smith pulls her boyfriends severed arm from the Blob
as the rest of ‘em melts in the mass of sentient Jell-o

Our group is unfazed by the scene Seeing headless corpses in
real life will do that to you

WENDELL
This place has a movie theater

JETHRO
Rigs like these all have ‘em

Gates surveys the theater
He grips his briefcase in his left hand and holds Kurt’s MP5

with his right The gun’s shoulder strap is slung across his
chest to support his single arm carry style

SANBORN
Hey Gates what’s so important in
that briefcase you’re carryin’ that
it needs to be handcuffed to you

GATES
It’s our insurance policy It
guarantees containment once we
leave the platform

SANBORN
How exactly would it do that
GATES
It will sterilize the site
HARLEY
What do you mean sterilize the
site
JETHRO
He means vaporize the site Dontcha
Gates
Gates says nothing
SANBORN

That sounds a hell of a lot like
what you’re carryin’ is an
explosive

JETHRO
That’s cause that’s what it is

HARLEY
You got a fuckin’ bomb shackled to
your arm

GATES
(nonchalant)
Yes

HARLEY
Is it armed

GATES
Of course not
(changes subject)
There’s a stairwell on the other
side of that exit that will take us
up to the next level

Gates doesn’t bother waiting just marches off for the exit

Sanborn Harley Wendell and Jethro watch him head down the
aisle

HARLEY
Why don’t I believe him

JETHRO
Because you ain’t dumb
INT STAIRWELL - A MOMENT LATER
Gates stands in a stairwell staring at the staircase

The rest of the group comes out the exit door from the
theater

They stop next to Gates and gaze up the flight of stairs
which wind up to second level of the rig

Wendell looks over at Harley

WENDELL
Ladies first

HARLEY
Suck my dick

Settles that
Sanborn looks over at Gates

SANBORN
How about Gates goes first

GATES
Very well

Gates climbs the staircase

Sanborn Harley Wendell and Jethro watch Gates ascend the
steps solo

He stops midway up Looks back

GATES (CONT’D)
Are the rest of you coming along

No one wants to but they all know the answer They have no
choice

They start up the stairs

EXT MAIN DECK (SECOND LEVEL) - SUNDOWN

The sun dips below the horizon as Gates leads the group up
onto the second level

An open air deck with several small hangar facilities
FOUR HANGARS to be exact

SANBORN
Which one is it

GATES
I don’t know We’re going to have
to check each hangar

Gates looks out toward the sea
GATES (CONTD)
And we should proceed with our
search without delay Because it
appears we have another reason to
get off this rig

The rest of the group looks to where Gates is staring

In the distance waaaaaay across the ocean we can make out a
SHAPE It’s so far away it appears to be inching

Inching towards the rig

HARLEY
Is that

GATES
It’s a ship

SANBORN
Who’s on that ship Gates

GATES
Educated guess The Weyland Oil
containment team

Oh shit

JETHRO
Oh shit

HARLEY
Why oh shit

WENDELL
Cus that ain’t no welcomin’ party
aboard that ship They ain’t gonna
take too kindly to folks aboard
their top secret research facility
that s’posed to be an oil rig

JETHRO
How far out you think they are

SANBORN
Not very far An hour’s being
generous

GATES
We need to locate the weapon Time
is of the essence

WENDELL
What we standin’ around jerkin each
other off for then

Jethro nods in agreement

JETHRO
Let’s go get it

Wendell and Jethro both head off gung-ho for the first
hangar

Gates takes off right after them

Sanborn and Harley trade a look Shrug Join the search

EXT HANGAR 1 - MOMENTS LATER

The group reaches HANGAR 1 A gray metal structure with no
identifying features or markings

Except for a large “1” in white paint on its door
Next to the door there’s a numeric keypad
GATES
(re keypad)
Only a key code will open this
door
Harley grasps the knob on the door Turns it The door opens
HARLEY

(to Gates)
Always try the knob first

Harley steps inside followed by Sanborn Wendell Jethro
and finally Gates

INT HANGAR 1 - CONTINUOUS

Harley enters the hangar the rest of the group falls in
behind her

The interior is BRIGHTLY LIT by a series of FLUORESCENT LAMPS
hanging from the ceiling

The space is filled with all sorts of high tech equipment A
MASSIVE CONTROL PANEL daisy chained PROXY SERVERS remote
SATELLITE FEED DISPLAYS and in the center of the room

A MAN in a hospital gown restrained at the wrists ankles
and neck on an upright mechanized steel gurney

The Man wears a device on his head that looks like a metal
spaghetti strainer with black cables snaking out its top

Several FLUID BAGS hang on a IV STAND next to the gurney
dripping medication into tubing connected to the Man’s arm

But the medicine in those bags ain’t gonna help ‘em much
Unless it’s able to heal that BULLET HOLE in the center of

the Man’s head If it weren’t for the head wound you’d think
he was just sleeping

Oh and there’s also TWO DEAD SCIENTISTS in lab coats on the
floor both headless (of course) laying at the Man’s feet

But for once the guys missing heads isn’t the focus of
anyone’s attention It’s obviously-

HARLEY
What the hell was going on here

Yeah More or less

They all move cautiously through the hangar and stop in front
of the restrained Man

WENDELL
(re Man)
What were they doin’ to ‘em

GATES
Testing of some sort Possibly

Harley gets closer for a better look-

CRUNCH
She lifts her foot and looks down She stepped on A SYRINGE

Harley turns her attention back to the Man on the gurney She
inspects the metal restraints on the Man’s wrists and neck

HARLEY
These lock pneumatically They
really wanted to make sure this guy
couldn’t get out of this thing

JETHRO
Well he made out better than those
two
Jethro gestures to the Two Dead Scientists
SANBORN
I wouldn’t describe that as makin’
it out better
JETHRO
A bullet in the brain beats the
hell outta havin’ your whole head
turn into a goddam blood volcano
Good point
WENDELL
Well what we came for ain’t in
here
GATES

Wendell’s right Let’s try the next
hangar

INT HANGAR 2 - MOMENTS LATER
Gates Sanborn Harley Wendell and Jethro enter Hangar 2
It’s set up exactly the same as Hangar 1

With a similarly gruesome scene in the center of the room

A SECOND MAN in a hospital gown is strapped into another
upright mechanized steel gurney

Second Man also wears the same device on his head with black
cables running out its top

He also has a BULLET HOLE in his forehead like our first Man

There’s TWO BODIES on the floor in front of the Second Man
A HEADLESS SECURITY GUARD I can tell he’s a security guard
because of the well the uniform he’s wearing Plus the
patch on his arm says “SECURITY” on it

Next to ‘em lays another lab coated SCIENTIST with a
PARTIALLY EXPLODED HEAD

The right side of the Scientist’s face is literally gone

Maybe you notice that the Scientist grips a SYRINGE in his
hand

But for now pretend I didn’t mention it Because you’re too
distracted by his half-of-face that you probably never
noticed

Because it’s Jackson Pollocked against a wall of proxy
servers

None of the living people in the room look like they know
what to do next

Because well they don’t

Finally Harley decides to take action She heads for the
dead men in the middle of the hangar

GATES
What is she doing

Sanborn shrugs
Harley reaches the bodies

She kneels down next to the Security Guard Her hand reaches
for a GUN on the Security Guard’s hip

Gates immediately points Kurt’s MP5 at Harley
GATES (CONTD)
I would advise against that Ms

OHara

SANBORN
Put the gun down Gates

GATES
Harley first

Harley rests her hand on top the gun

HARLEY
Don’t worry Gates I’m not planning
on shootin’ you I want the gun in
case I start to get a headache

GATES
Sorry but you’re going to have to
just take an Aspirin
HARLEY
Aspirin ain’t gonna stop my head
from fuckin’ exploding
Click-CLACK
Wendell trains his MP5 on Gates

WENDELL
Let the lady have the goddam gun

Gates locks eyes with Wendell His gaze moves down to the
submachine gun aimed at him

GATES
You can’t be serious

WENDELL
Fraid so

Gates looks over at Jethro for help

Jethro grins Takes off the MP5 he took from Cooper that he’s
been carrying on his back WHISTLES at Sanborn Tosses him
the weapon

Sanborn catches the machine gun

SANBORN
Thanks

Gate’s can only watch on Knows he’s outnumbered and
outgunned

GATES
I was expecting one of you to still
be professional

JETHRO

We all in the same boat now
SANBORN

You know what you’re problem is

Gates
(MORE )

SANBORN (CONTD)
It’s that you still think you’re
runnin’ things But you ain’t

GATES
That’s clear to me now

Gates lowers his gun
Harley looks over at Wendell Nods Thanks
Wendell winks like a creep Ruins it
GATES (CONTD)
Well since I’m not the one in
charge
(looks at Sanborn)

How do you suggest we proceed

Harley stands holding the dead Security Guard’s gun Answers
for Sanborn

HARLEY
On to the next one

HARD CUT TO

A WOMAN’S FACE

Attractive

Young

Twenties maybe

Her eyes are closed

We pop wider to reveal --

She’s in a hospital gown

A depressed SYRINGE still stuck in her arm
She’s restrained in an upright gurney

Just like the men in Hangars 1 and 2

Sanborn Harley Gates Wendell and Jethro stand in front of
the woman

FIVE HEADLESS BODIES encircle them on the floor

The Woman’s eyes shift beneath her eye lids
REM sleep
She’s alive

And in case you haven’t guessed we’re inside

INT HANGAR 3 - NIGHT
Gates leans close to examine the Woman

GATES
She must have been administered an
anesthesia to keep her unconscious

SANBORN
We need to wake her up

GATES
That’s most likely a waste of your
time and energy She could be ina
deep medical induced coma

SANBORN
Well if you hadn’t shot the first
live person we came across maybe we
could have got a clearer picture of
what it is we’re dealing with

GATES
Do you hear that Sanborn

Gates holds a hand to his ear Don’t worry they aren’t
bleeding

GATES (CONTD)
That’s the ticking of the timers in
our skulls Counting down since the
moment we’ve stepped aboard this
rig And everyone’s timer is set to
its very own duration I might have
five minutes on my timer You might
have five seconds on yours

(then)

We need to go to the last hangar
The weapon has to be there

SANBORN
Why don’t you go on ahead by
yourself Gates
(re Woman)
I want to find out what she knows
GATES
I’m not going alone
Beat
WENDELL
You scared Gates
GATES
No I may need help securing the
weapon So who’s accompanying me
Beat

Everyone swaps glances Then --

JETHRO
We can draw straws

Sanborn sighs

SANBORN
Fuck it Let’s go Gates

He turns to Harley

SANBORN (CONTD)
Do you think you’d be able to get
those restraints to unlock

HARLEY
I don’t have any tools But yeah
Have no idea if we’ll be able to
wake her up though

SANBORN
(re Wendell)
Are you gonna be okay with this
one

WENDELL
Hey Fuck you
(then)
I ain’t so bad

JETHRO
You ain’t got to worry about
Wendell I’1ll keep ‘em on a leash
Harley looks from Sanborn to Wendell and Jethro

HARLEY
Get goin’ We’ll get her down

EXT MAIN DECK (SECOND LEVEL) - NIGHT
Sanborn and Gates exit Hangar 3
They move across the deck toward the last hangar

SANBORN
I hope you’re right about this
weapon being the key to our
survival

GATES
I hope I’m right too

SANBORN
That’s not the answer I wanted to
hear

Sanborn and Gates reach HANGAR 4 Same as the others Gray
metal No identifying features or markings Except for a
large “4” on its door

Sanborn and Gates stand staring at the door Nether one of
them wants to go inside

SANBORN (CONTD)
So If it’s in there Then what

GATES
Then we take it That simple

SANBORN
Nothing about this job has been
that simple

GATES
You don’t make the big bucks to do
easy shit

SANBORN
Save your Jordan Belfort seminar
quotes for someone dumb enough for
it to work on

Sanborn opens the door to the hangar and steps inside

INT HANGAR 4 - CONTINUOUS

Were looking straight at the entrance of the hangar Sanborn
slowly enters Gates falls in close behind a moment later

Both men stand right inside the doorway Staring Confused
looks plastered on their faces

SANBORN
Un-fuckin-believable

GATES
I don’t understand

We pull away from Sanborn and Gates

Floating back deeper into the hangar

Deeper

And deeper

Until we finally stop

And were looking across a AN EMPTY HANGAR back at Sanborn
and Gates

INT HANGAR 3 - SAME TIME

Jethro watches over Harley’s shoulder as she wrenches off a
cover panel on the side of the mechanized gurney revealing
an array of circuit boards and wires

Wendell removes the helmet device on The Woman’s head and
tosses it to the floor

Harley traces a multi-colored wire into a connecting port
She grabs it

HARLEY
(to Wendell)
Be ready

Wendell positions himself hands up ready to catch her

WENDELL
Just say when

Harley nods then-

WENDELL (CONTD)
Wait

HARLEY
What

Wendell pulls the syringe out of The Woman’s arm Chucks it
over his shoulder

WENDELL
Okay Now say-

HARLEY
When
Harley yanks the multicolored wire
Wendell’s caught off guard but --
Fitzzzz The circuit board sparks
Nothing happens
HARLEY (CONTD)
Shit
INT HANGAR 3 - SAME TIME

Sanborn and Gates walk over to a BROWN STAIN in the middle of
the empty hangar

SANBORN
(re stain)
Looks like blood

GATES
Whatever was here clearly isn’t
anymore
No shit
SANBORN

So now what

GATES
It’s here somewhere I know it is

Clearly it ain’t in here
Sanborn looks around the space Has a sudden epiphany
SANBORN
How didn’t I think of it before
(snaps his fingers)

I know where the weapon is

GATES
You do

He does
SANBORN

Yes It was right under our noses
the whole goddam time

GATES
Where
Yeah where
SANBORN
The weapon is
(pause)
Up your ass
Dick
GATES

Your humor isn’t appreciated Mr
Sanborn

INT HANGAR 3 - SAME TIME

Harley looks at a tangle of wiring hanging out the mechanized
gurney She blows the hair from her face in frustration

JETHRO
Wanna try and see if we can’t pry
‘em off

HARLEY

No I got a better idea

JETHRO
What

Harley pulls the gun she took off the Security Guard from her
waistband Points it at the circuit board

BLAM
Shoots it
Nothing happens

JETHRO (CONTD)
Nothin’ happened

Harley shrugs
BLAM BLAM BLAM

Fires three more times into the machine

INT HANGAR 4 - SAME TIME

Gates and Sanborn stand in the empty hangar arguing

SANBORN
You’ve led us on a wild goose chase
Gates Face it And now we’re all
gonna die because of it

GATES
This isn’t a wild goose chase Mr
Sanborn You’ve seen first hand the
power of this weapon aboard this
rig

SANBORN
What I’ve seen is a fucked
situation get even more fucked as
we’ve went along And the whole
time you’ve been so adamant that
you know what needs to be done But
you don’t know shit You don’t even
know where the goddam thing is

GATES
I’m telling you it’s here Of that
I’m positive
SANBORN
Are you Because I’1ll I’ve seen so
far are four hangars and no
biological weapon

GATES
We’re missing something

SANBORN
No shit The weapon

GATES
That’s not what I mean We have
overlooked something in our search

SANBORN
What would that be

Sanborn does a 180° with his arms out in the middle of the
empty hangar for emphasis

GATES
Not in here In the other hangars

SANBORN
All we’ve came across in the others
are headless bodies and three
people who look like they were
jacked into the Matrix

(MORE)

SANBORN (CONTD)
Two of which have bullets in their
heads for some reason

Realization spreads across Gates’ face

GATES
(to himself)
It can’t be

SANBORN
What

GATES
(shakes his head)
I didn’t see it

SANBORN
Gates I don’t know what the hell
youre talkin’ about

Gates looks at Sanborn

Beat

GATES
Why would they shoot them

SANBORN
Shoot who

GATES
The men in the first two hangars

SANBORN

Put them out their misery before
their heads exploded

(shrugs)

How should I know

GATES

No They weren’t concerned about
their misery If that were a
concern they wouldn’t have
restrained them the way they are
And the woman who’s still alive
still has her head does she not

SANBORN
Okay

GATES
Are you following what I’m saying
Mr Sanborn

No
SANBORN
Is that a trick fuckin’ question
GATES
No It is not
SANBORN
Well then no
GATES
What I’m saying is we’ve located
the weapon already
Huh

SANBORN
What

INT HANGAR 3 - SAME TIME

Harley stares at the smoking remains of the gurney’s
circuitry Looks up at The Woman still locked in restraints

HARLEY
Runnin’ low on ideas guys

JETHRO
Hmm I might have one

HARLEY
I’m all ears

Harley waits

Jethro scratches his head Thinks

Beat
Then

JETHRO
I got nothin’

Harley sighs

Wendell walks around the gurney He spots a RED BUTTON on its
backside

WENDELL
What’s this do

He pushes the button

HISS

The restraint around The Woman’s neck unlocks
HISS HISS

The restraints on her wrists unlock

HISS HISS

Followed by the restraints on her ankles

The Woman falls forward --
IV’s RIPPING OUT

SMACK

Hits the floor FACE FIRST

Harley Jethro and Wendell hurry over to where The Woman
fell

She lays on the floor Still unconscious

Jethro looks at Wendell

JETHRO

You was s’posed to catch her
WENDELL

I can’t do it all I got her down

didnt I
Harley kneels by The Woman Rolls her onto her back gently
The Woman’s nose is broken from the impact of the fall
HARLEY
(re broken nose)
Ouch She’s gonna feel that like a
bitch when she wakes up
JETHRO
Still looks better than Wendell’s

nose

Wendell flips Jethro off

WENDELL
(to Harley)
How the hell do we wake her up

HARLEY
If that fall didn’t I’m not too
optimistic we can

Harley lightly slaps The Woman’s face in an attempt to wake
her

WENDELL
That shit definitely ain’t gonna
work
HARLEY
Got a better suggestion
Beat
WENDELL
Anyone got smellin’ salt on ‘em
Beat

That’s ano

SANBORN (0C)
Don’t try to wake her

Harley Wendell and Jethro look across the hangar at
Sanborn and Gates marching towards them

HARLEY
Doubt we could anyway

Harley rises from her crouch
HARLEY (CONTD)
What did you find in the other

hangar

SANBORN
Nothing It’s empty

WENDELL
Hell you mean it’s empty

Sanborn and Gates reach them in the center of the hangar
They both look down at The Woman
SANBORN
What happened to her nose

JETHRO
Wendell ain’t catch her

GATES
Why didn’t you catch her

WENDELL
Fuck all that If the other
hangar’s empty where’s the goddam
weapon

GATES
(re The Woman)
Youre looking at it

Huh

WENDELL
What

Wendell Jethro and Harley look back down at The Woman
confused

JETHRO
Now hold on You’re sayin’ that
Sleepin’ Beauty here is the weapon

GATES
Yes

Really

HARLEY
How’s that even possible

GATES
Biological weapons are
traditionally defined as infectious
agents like bacteria viruses even
fungi But humans are biological
Are we not

Oh Shit
Right
WENDELL
Lemme get this straight You’re

sayin’ she’s the one killin’
everybody on the rig

GATES
Well I don’t think she’s entirely
responsible for all the casualties
aboard this rig

WENDELL
What’s that mean Either she is or
she ain’t

SANBORN
Gates thinks that the woman and the
two men in the other hangars were
being used for experimental bio
warfare And for whatever reason
they started killin’ everyone on
the rig The crew tried to stop
‘em That’s why we found the first
two guys with bullets in their
heads

HARLEY
If that’s true That would mean we
were never infected

SANBORN
It appears that way

They all look at Gates

GATES
What

If looks could kill Gates would be dead as fucking Dillinger

GATES (CONTD)
Based on the intel I was given I
had no way of knowing that what we
were dealing with was not
infectious

JETHRO
(back with the program)
No one’s askin’ the right question
here

SANBORN
What’s that

JETHRO
How in the hell can a person can
make another person’s head explode

Yeah How

GATES
That’s not clear

WENDELL
Yeah No shit it ain’t

GATES
Maybe these test subjects were born
with extraordinary psychic
abilities Or maybe those abilities
are the result of experimentation

JETHRO
If she is what you say she is why
ain’t she killin’ us right now

GATES
For some reason she’s dormant And
since we don’t know how long that
will last I suggest we should take
full advantage of that

WENDELL
Well I agree with that much

Click-CLACK
Wendell trains his MP5 on The Woman

GATES
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

WENDELL
What’s it look like I’m endin’
this shit right now
Gates pulls his MP5 on Wendell
GATES
You do and I’1l drop you right
where you stand
Wendell looks back at Gates

Jethro raises his gun pointing it at Gates

JETHRO
Then I drop you right after

Sanborn and Harley stay still Watching but clearly not
interested in joining this Mexican standoff

GATES
She’s coming with us Alive

WENDELL
You must have shit for brains If
any of whatcha said’s true that
means this comatose cunt killed
three of my team while she was
unconscious We take her back with
us and we’ll be dead before we ever
reach shore

He makes a valid argument

GATES
She’s the entire reason we are
here

SANBORN

Wendell’s right Gates There’s no
scenario where we take her back
with us She’s a danger to us all

GATES
I’m not taking no for answer on
this

SANBORN

You’re outgunned
ON THE FLOOR
The Woman’s eyes MOVE beneath her lids

GATES (0C)
We are leaving with her

HARLEY (0C)
Give it up you stubborn son of a
bitch
The movement under her eyelids increases
No one notices They’re too busy screaming at each other
Not us though

We LEAN IN on The Woman’s CLOSED DARTING EYES as we --

CUT TO

A ROVING POV
We’re OUTSIDE

On the MAIN DECK of the rig
We MOVE along it
FAST

Erratic

Constantly looking
LEFT to RIGHT
RIGHT to LEFT
Searching

For something
Anything

Up ahead of us we spot TWO SEAGULLS

Picking at brains near Kurt’s headless body

We focus on ONE
One recognizable DIRTY SEAGULL
Our speed increases as we approach

Neither of the gulls seem to be aware

We STOP just INCHES from the Dirty Seagull

We stare at the bird

It looks up Neck stiffening

A familiar auditory signal -- RINGING -- floods our ears

Then Its head POPS in a POOF of BLOOD and FEATHERS
The second seagull flies off startled SQUAWKING madly

We take off again Zigzagging as we ZOOM across the rig

Back on the prowl

We circle around

Head toward the entrance to the bridge control room

PASS RIGHT THROUGH THE DOORS LIKE WE HAVE NO MASS into --

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

We FLY through the control room with manic energy -- vision
sweeping -- we pass the headless guy in the chair -- and we
INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Blast into the hallway -- pin balling door to door -- peering
in each room -- see Cooper’s body in the last -- continuing
INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Into the corridor leading to the mess hall -- we RIP down the
hall -- pass right through the door at the other end into
INT MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

The macabre scene in the mess hall -- we desperately scan the
space -- then speed toward a wall -- dissolving through it to
INT INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

An INFIRMARY filled with HEADLESS PATIENTS -- we scour the
clinic -- Then-

WENDELL (VO)

You better get that gun off me
Gates

We stop

GATES (VO)
Take your weapon off of the woman

We spin around 360° inside the room Searching for the where
the voices are coming from

WENDELL (VO)
Fuck you

We continue to whirl around the room Confused
SANBORN (VO)
This can only end bad for you
Gates

Then all of the sudden everything goes --

BLACK

Beat

WENDELL (0C)
She’s gotta die

HARD CUT TO

THE WOMAN’S FACE
Her eyes are shut Still
We’re back inside Hangar 3

WENDELL (0C)
That’s the bottom line

The Woman’s EYES POP OPEN
WOMANS POV
Looking up into the barrel of Wendell’s MP5

Wendell hasn’t saw because he’s looking at Gates who’s
still holding a gun on him

GATES
I won’t hesitate to kill you
Wendell

WENDELL
(to Jethro)
The moment he shoots Jethro you
put ‘em down

JETHRO
I got ‘em

GATES
This is nonsense We are running
out of time

WENDELL
Say goodbye to your weapon

Wendell looks down at The Woman
He’s surprised to see she’s looking right back at ‘em

WENDELL (CONTD)
Oh fu-

He doesn’t even get to finish his sentence

WENDELL’S HEAD BUSTS like a blood-filled water balloon

Drenching everyone crimson as brain chunks rain down like
confetti

His body drops like a sack of shit

The Woman rolls over onto her stomach Pushes herself off the
floor Stands on her bare feet

And we get a good look at her

Haunted eyes

Stringy hair

Broken nose streaking dried blood down her mouth and chin
Hospital gown hanging loosely on her slender frame
Sanborn Harley Jethro and Gates stare at The Woman
Beat An then --

JETHRO
Kill this bitch

Everyone except Gates pulls their gun on The Woman

The Woman raises her arm up and waves her hand to the left
and --

Jethro Sanborn and Harley’s guns FLY OUT THEIR HANDS And
SLAM against the other side of the hangar

WHAT

IN THE

ACTUAL

FUCK

No one moves

A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD leaks from The Woman’s nose

She put her hand to it Pulls it away Looks at the blood on
her fingertips

( NOTE FROM RYAN - Each time she uses telekinesis (TK) her
nose will bleed Itll make sense Promise)

Jethro decides to make a move Does the one thing you or I
wouldn’t do in this situation He charges The Woman

JETHRO (CONTD)
ARRRRAAAHHHHH

The Woman’s eyes narrow

Blood starts to GEYSER from Jethro’s ears as he bounds toward
her

The Woman doesn’t flinch or move a muscle as he bull rushes
She only stares at him brow scrunched And then--

JETHRO’S SKULL BLOWS TO PIECES

Going off like the Death Star at the end of A New Hope

While still in mid-run

His body continues its sprint for a couple of strides before
it collapses like a marionette with its strings cut

Sanborn Harley and Gates stand dumbstruck

Gates immediately tosses his MP5 to the floor

Pussy move But I can’t blame ‘em for it

(Though he still has the revolver)

The Woman looks at the three of them

And she says the only word we’ll ever hear her speak
Because she won’t speak again

THE WOMAN
Run

Gates is already running

Sanborn and Harley decide to heed The Woman’s advice too
They take off for the hangar’s exit

The Woman just watches Silent

Gates reaches the door first Bangs through it

Never looks back

Sanborn and Harley run up a few moments after

They race out the exit

The Woman stands alone in the empty hangar Then she takes a
step

EXT MAIN DECK (SECOND LEVEL) - NIGHT

Gates runs along deck lugging along that briefcase

Still leading the pack

Sanborn and Harley are gaining

They pass each hangar as they head for stairs back to the
lower level

When they reach the stairs Gates damn near throws himself
down them

Sanborn and Harley steal a glance back at Hangar 3 before
they descend and see --

The Woman stepping out of the hangar
Oh shit Oh shit Oh shit Oh shit

Sanborn and Harley dart down the stairwell

INT MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
Gates hauls ass up the aisle trailed by Sanborn and Harley
As the credits roll for The Blob on screen
GATES
(over shoulder)

Did you see her toss your guns
She’s more powerful than I

imagined

SANBORN
Less talking Gates and more
running

INT MESS HALL - MOMENT LATER
Running as fast as they can manage through the mess hall

Slip-sliding on the GOOP slick floor Nearly breaking their
necks

Gates still won’t shut up
His excitement overpowering his terror
GATES
(excited)
S-she’s remarkable
SANBORN
Why don’t you go back there and
proprose since you like her so
goddam much

They make it to the exit as we --

CUT TO

INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Gates Sanborn and Harley haul ass through the mess hall
corridor

GATES
She’s too valuable We need to
figure out how we can sedate her
SANBORN
We’re heading straight to the
fuckin’ boat You’re crazy if you
think we’re gonna-
Gates turns on the run
BLAM
Shoots Sanborn in the leg
Sanborn SCREAMS Falls to the floor

HARLEY
John

Harley drops next to Sanborn

SANBORN
My fucking LEG

Gates stands looking down at the two of them Smiles
Smug

What an asshole

Harley looks up at Gates Hate burning
HARLEY
You piece of shit You didn’t have
to shoot ‘em in his leg
GATES
I’1l grant you the courtesy of
shooting you in the head
Gates points his gun at Harley’s forehead
GATES (CONT’D)
We she finds you you’1ll already be
dead Mr Sanborn will not be so
fortunate
HARLEY
Who’s gonna sail you the fuck outta
here Gates
GATES
(shrugs)
I own a yacht I’1l manage
(then)
Consider this mercy-
BANG
Gates is hit from behind in his shoulder by a gunshot
He’s spun around from its force

Gates looks ahead with a stunned expression at --

Magneto Man (remember him) holding a pistol Bleeding from
the chest wound where he was shot But alive Well alive-ish

Gates tries to raise his firearm and-
BANG BANG
Magneto Man fires twice

The first bullet SNAPS the handcuff chain connecting his
briefcase to his wrist

The second bullet blasts off Gates’ trigger finger
Gates CRIES OUT
His gun and briefcase CLATTER to the floor

Magneto Man staggers toward Gates
GATES (CONTD)
I sh-shot you

Magneto Man stops within a few steps of Gates

MAGNETO MAN
I shot you back

The scientist levels his gun at Gates’ kneecap
BLAM
Gates HOWLS Drops to his ass
He’ll never dance again
Harley and Sanborn look up at the half dead scientist
Magneto Man stares back at them
Beat
Then
MAGNETO MAN (CONTD)
(re Gates)

You want to Or should I

Harley snatches up Gates’ dropped pistol Points it at
head

Gates meets eyes with Harley He’s in fucking agony

GATES
(through gritted teeth)
D-do it Put me out my

misery
Harley lowers the gun

HARLEY
You ain’t getting off that easy

Beat Then

SANBORN
Gimme the gun

Harley looks at Sanborn

SANBORN (CONTD)
Give it to me

She hands him the weapon

his
Sanborn points the gun at Gates
Gates locks eyes with Sanborn

GATES
D-do it

Sanborn shifts his aim down to Gates’ other kneecap

BANG
Gates SHRIEKS in pain

SANBORN
I’m leaving you for her

Gates BLUBBERS on the floor
We don’t feel a bit bad for the fuck
MAGNETO MAN
(to Sanborn)
So the woman’s free

Sanborn and Harley look at the scientist

SANBORN
Yes

MAGNETO MAN
Then we better move our asses

SANBORN
You gonna be able to

MAGNETO MAN

You don’t look like you’re in that

much better shape my friend

SANBORN
Fair point

Sanborn reaches over and grabs a hold of Gates’

SANBORN (CONT’D)
(to Harley)
Little help

briefcase

Harley puts a shoulder into him Lifting him to his feet

SANBORN (CONTD)
(to Magneto Man)
So who is she

Magneto Man looks at Sanborn
MAGNETO MAN
It’s not who she is that’s
important

CUT TO

INT STAIRWELL - SAME TIME
The Woman steps off the staircase

MAGNETO MAN (0S)
It’s what she is that is

She moves slow and deliberate Walking down her prey

SANBORN (0S)
And what exactly is she

MAGNETO MAN (0S)
Something new
INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER
Magneto Man Harley and Sanborn hobble through the hall
It’s slow going Clearly painful
The scientist is pale as a ghost He’s lost a lot of blood
MAGNETO MAN
Of all the test subjects she was
the wild card She
He stops Puts his hand against the wall to hold himself up
Harley and Sanborn halt behind him

HARLEY
You okay

MAGNETO MAN
I’m dying

He slowly sits down on the floor

HARLEY
You can’t just sit here

MAGNETO MAN
Just listen I don’t have much time
and neither do you two She’s not
like the other two male test
subjects

INT MOVIE THEATER - SAME TIME

We watch The Woman as she walks up the aisle Her bare ass
exposed from the open-back hospital gown

MAGNETO MAN (0S)
They were controllable We
started with them Two men with a
one of kind psychic ability And we
discovered how to harness it

BACK TO

INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS

MAGNETO MAN

We found out if we were able to pin
down a human target’s location by
patching in satellite data directly
into the test subjects’ brains
they could hone in on that person’s
specific brain wave activity and do
what normally they needed to be in
the same room with someone to do

SANBORN
Turn someone’s head into a bomb

MAGNETO MAN
Essentially but the range was
limited to a hundred miles Until
we came up with a neural network

HARLEY
What’s that

MAGNETO MAN
It’s a way to daisy chain the
subjects together By doing that we
increased the range by ten times
But we wanted to be able to
increase it more

SANBORN
So you needed a third test subject

MAGNETO MAN
Yes Problem was our two male
subjects were the only two people
in the entire planet who exhibited
their ability we’ve been able to
find So we decided to create a
third test subject

HARLEY
Youre saying you guys made her

MAGNETO MAN
That’s exactly what we did

INT MESS HALL - SAME TIME

SANBORN (0S)
How

The Woman’s bare feet SQUISH over the gore-covered floor of
the mess hall

MAGNETO MAN (0S)
We studied the brains of our two
male subjects and discovered that
their pineal glands produced a
chemical that we’d never seen
before

BACK TO

INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS

MAGNETO MAN
So we extracted it and began
introducing into the brains of
numerous handpicked volunteer
subjects We set up a hangar just
to perform this procedure

SANBORN
Hangar four

MAGNETO MAN
Yes None of the volunteers
survived the procedure because
none of them possessed a specific
dormant brain abnormality to
withstand the introduction of
the chemical into their brain
stems
SANBORN
Except for the woman

MAGNETO MAN
Except for her And when she was
plugged into the neural network
the test subjects started killing
everyone aboard the rig

SANBORN
And you tried to stop them

MAGNETO MAN
Yes We unplugged the neural
network it didn’t do anything
They all three had bonded somehow
and no longer needed the network to
connect to each other We gave them
tranquilizer shots to put them
under Which seemed to work At
first Then

HARLEY
People’s heads started exploding
again

MAGNETO MAN
Yes they were able to attack us
even while in a completely
unconscious state but it was
like they were doing so blindly
At random So we had to try
and terminate the test subjects

SANBORN
You shot them Except the girl
because no one got close enough
without getting killed by her

Magneto Man nods a yes

HARLEY
She made our guns fly out of our
hands with a wave of her hand How
was she able to do that

MAGNETO MAN

(surprised)
She did That means the
experiment must have turned on

dormant genes

SANBORN
What

MAGNETO MAN
Remember I said the volunteer
subjects were handpicked

SANBORN
Yeah

MAGNETO MAN
Since we were unable to find
others who possessed psychic
abilities We found descendents
of those who were reported to have
had them The woman’s father
reportedly

SANBORN
Had telekinesis

The scientist nods yes

MAGNETO MAN
The other volunteers died
because their descendents were
all frauds They claimed to have
abilities they never possessed

INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Gates sits in the hallway Back against the wall He looks

over down the corridor at --
The Woman She stands silent Looking at him

GATES
No

The Woman starts to walk toward him
GATES (CONT’D)

Stop Please I wanted to take

you from this place
Her eyes bore into Gates as she closes in on him
Gates ears begin to RING
Blood vessels balloon at his temples
His ear canals flow red

He SCREEEEEEEAAAAAAAAMS as

HIS CRANIUM EXPLODES

Blasting apart like a pressurized watermelon
Making Rorschach ink blot on the wall behind him
The Woman never even stops walking

She passes right by him continuing down the hallway

INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS - SAME TIME

Sanborn Harley and Magneto Man turn to the sound of Gates
meeting his much deserved death

HARLEY
She’s coming

Magneto Man takes off his helmet revealing a full head of
matted white hair

MAGNETO MAN
(holds up the helmet)
Here Take this and go Sorry
there’s not two

Sanborn grabs the helmet

SANBORN
What’s this

MAGNETO MAN
It’s a prototype Made it right
before things got out of control

SANBORN
What’s it do

MAGNETO MAN
It blocks their ability In

theory But it won’t help against
TR

Sanborn puts it on

SANBORN
Hope your theory’s right

MAGNETO MAN
Go

Harley helps Sanborn limp down the hallway

The scientist watches them until they reach the door to the
bridge

Soon as they pass through it at the other end of the hall --
The Woman enters
Magneto Man looks over at her

He lifts his gun with what little strength he has left
Presses it against the bottom of his chin

MAGNETO MAN (CONTD)
Almost didn’t have to

BANG
The scientist shoots himself
Paints the ceiling with his brains

Slumps over dead

INT BRIDGE - SAME TIME
Sanborn and Harley react to the sound of the gunshot

Pick up the pace as they move through the control room on the
bridge

But it ain’t much faster because of Sanborn’s shot leg
They literally hop along like they’re in a potato sack race
Sanborn hanging off Harley’s shoulder for balance

They don’t dare to sneak a look back for The Woman as they
near the exit

The door getting closer
And closer
And closer

Until

EXT CATWALK OIL RIG - DAY
Sanborn and Harley come out to --
TWENTY GUNS pointed at them

THE WEYLAND CONTAINMENT TEAM stands across the deck

20 MEN in black tactical gear
All armed and ready to inflict harm
TEAM LEADER (40’s) steps forward

TEAM LEADER
DROP YOUR WEAPON

Sanborn drops the pistol he got from Gates

TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
AND SET DOWN THE BRIEFCASE

Sanborn complies Sets it on the deck Nice and slow
Beat

TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
IDENTIFY YOUR SELVES

Sanborn and Harley offer no answer

TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
I REPEAT IDENTIFY YOUR SELVES

SANBORN
I’m John Sanborn

TEAM LEADER
THE WOMAN TOO

HARLEY
My name is Harley Harley OHara

TEAM LEADER

ARE YOU PART OF THE WEYLAND OIL
RESEARCH TEAM

SANBORN
Yes

Harley gives him a look What
Sanborn answers her with one that says You wanna get shot

TEAM LEADER
WHAT’S YOUR IDENTIFICATION CODES

Huh

SANBORN
We don’t have time for this One of
the test subjects is roaming free
aboard the rig and she’s extremely
fucking dangerous
The Team Leader remains silent for a beat Then
TEAM LEADER
IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME YOUR
IDENTIFICATION CODES YOU WILL BE
SHOT
Oh shit

Before Sanborn and Harley can be shot down like Bonnie and
Clyde --

The Woman steps out from the bridge
Thank God

Wait That’s not good either

Oh shit

Again

Sanborn and Harley are literally caught in between both
sides

The meat in one giant Fucked sandwich
The Team Leader sees The Woman
TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
STOP WHERE YOU ARE IDENTIFY YOUR
SELF
The Woman doesn’t say shit Just stares at the Weyland Team
TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
IDENTIFY YOUR SELF OR WE WILL
SHOOT

Sanborn and Harley look back and forth from the Weyland
Containment Team and The Woman

TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING

The Woman raises her hand above her head and --

ALL OF THE MEN’S GUNS ARE TORN FROM THEIR GRIPS UP INTO THE
AIR
The Weyland Containment Team looks up at their weapons
20 ASSAULT RIFLES hang above the men’s heads
Suspended in mid-air
It’s a surreal sight
Like something out of the NRA’s wet dream

If they started jumping a fence Carleton Heston would count
them to fall asleep

The Woman keeps her hand raised above her head

Her NOSE bleeds LIKE A FAUCET as she uses her TK to keep the
weapons afloat

She SWIPES her arm out to the side and --

The assault rifles are sent flying into the ocean
The Weyland Containment Team are too shocked to react
Until --

The Team Leader pulls a GLOCK 9 from out its holster on his
back

BLAM
Fires a shot at The Woman Hitting her in the arm
The Woman CRIES OUT

She RIPS the glock from his hand with her TK Sends it
soaring where it SPLASHES into the sea

The Woman wipes fresh blood from her nostril
Then immediately locks in on the Team Leader
The Team Leader grabs at his temples SCREAMING

Sanborn and Harley use this moment to make their way out of
the middle of the fracas

Sanborn grabbing the briefcase and gun as they head to the
edge of the rig

The Team Leader drops to his knees

HIS HEAD RUPTURES

The rest of the Weyland Containment Team pull their
sidepieces

The Woman parts her arms and all of the men are SCATTERED
like bowling pins across the catwalk

Blood CASCADES down the front of her hospital gown from her
broken nose as a result

The Woman begins to walk towards the fallen men as they pick
themselves off the deck

She zeros in on one MAN
EXPLODES his head
SPLAT

Then ANOTHER

SPLAT

And a THIRD

SPLAT
She starts taking them out ONE AFTER ANOTHER
Heads GO OFF like Roman candles

As she attacks a large THROBBING VEIN starts to protrude
from The Woman’s forehead SWEAT beads at her temples

This is taking a lot of effort but it doesn’t seem to be as
taxing as when she uses her inherited (once dormant) TK
ability

OVER AT THE EDGE OF THE RIG
Sanborn and Harley stand watching shit unfold

HARLEY
Holy shit She’s she’s
slaughtering all of them

SANBORN
We gotta get off this rig now And
make sure she never does

HARLEY
How

Sanborn holds up the briefcase
SANBORN
We activate this Then we jump our
asses in the ocean

That’s actually not a bad plan

HARLEY
Sounds good

Sanborn sets the briefcase down And winces as Harley helps
him down onto his ass He opens the piece of luggage --

Revealing a sophisticated EXPLOSIVE DEVICE with a timing
mechanism

SANBORN
(to Harley)
You’re the handy one Can you
figure this out

HARLEY
Lemme give it a look

Harley leans down and starts tinkering
ACROSS THE DECK

The Woman continues her killing spree
Already half of the containment team is dead
She EXPLODES two guys heads AT ONCE

Then she begins taking out the rest of the team a pair at a
time

BACK AT EDGE OF THE RIG

Harley flips a series of switches
Flick

Flick

Flick

A LIGHT FLASHES on the device

A DIGITAL READOUT says

READY TO ARM
HARLEY (CONTD)
Now all we have to do is punch in
the time on the timer Then
activate it
Harley keys in 3 minutes
The readout says
PRESS TO ACTIVATE
Just as Harley reaches to press the button --
The briefcase SNAPS SHUT
THEN THROWS ITSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE RIG

Sanborn and Harley look up and see --

The Woman walking toward them from across the
flowing from her nose

She focuses on BOTH of them

Harley’s ears start to bleed

Can’t tell if Sanborn’s are under that helmet
But he appears to be fine

Sanborn looks over at Harley

SANBORN
Harley

HARLEY
John My ears are ringing Oh
my God

She closes her eyes and grabs fistfuls of her
Sanborn looks back at The Woman

The Woman looks at him confused

Sanborn realizes

SANBORN
The helmet works

platform Blood

hair

He draws his gun like an old west gunfighter and --

BLAM BLAM

Fires twice at The Woman from the sitting postition

Both shots hit there mark

The first bullet blows clean through her side

The second bullet enters high in the left side of her chest
She drops to the deck

Harley opens her eyes

Her ears have stopped bleeding

HARLEY
W-what what happened

She looks over at Sanborn smoking gun gripped in his fist

Then she looks across the deck to where The Woman lays on her
back

Beat
Then

HARLEY (CONTD)
You did it

She hugs him squeezing him around his neck like a goddam
Anaconda

SANBORN
Alright alright It was the helmet
Can’t believe it fucking worked-

Harley is suddenly RIPPED OFF Sanborn like a rag doll and
THROWN OVERBOARD by an invisible force

Sanborn looks back across the deck at --
The Woman

Standing once again

Nose dripping blood

Sanborn crawls over to the very edge of rig where Harley went
over and --

Sees Harley splashing in the ocean below

SANBORN (CONTD)
HARLEY

Harley manages to swim over to one of the legs of the sea
platform
Sanborn pulls himself away and gets to his feet slow
He turns and faces The Woman

SANBORN (CONTD)
You’re a real bitch You know that

He raises his gun and --

CLICK

Empty

Shit

The Woman smiles

Sanborn looks over at the entrance to the bridge

He drops the gun and begins to hop-run on his bad leg to it
The Woman eyes narrow to slits

She tries again to make Sanborn’s head blow

But she can’t

Sanborn gets closer and closer to the bridge entrance

The Woman realizes it’s the helmet that Sanborn’s wearing
that’s protecting him

She waves her arm and --

The helmet lifts off of Sanborn’s head right when he reaches
the entrance to the bridge

He turns to see it go overboard into the sea
The Woman grins

Sanborn opens the door and disappears inside the bridge

The Woman starts across the deck after Sanborn

INT BRIDGE (FIRST LEVEL) - SAME TIME

Sanborn pogos on one leg through the bridge

Catches himself as he slips in the pool of blood that’s
expanded beneath the headless man at the command console

He reaches the other side of the room and pushes through the
door right as --

The Woman enters the bridge She stalks after Sanborn

And even though she’s shot and not running she’s moving a
lot better than Sanborn with his shot up leg

INT HALLWAY - LIVING QUARTERS - MOMENT LATER

Sanborn clenches his teeth with every hopping step as he
moves down the hallway

Clearly hurts like a bitch for him to be moving even this
fast

The Woman walks into the corridor and stops

She watches Sanborn as he bounces on his leg entering the

INT MESS HALL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sanborn flees down the corridor covered in sweat

Looks like he’s gonna pass out any moment

INT MESS HALL - MOMENT LATER

Sanborn body slides in blood across the floor of the mess
hall

Gross But effective at getting him to the other side of the
cafeteria faster
INT MOVIE THEATER - MOMENT LATER

Sanborn falls and rolls down the incline of the aisle of the
movie theater

It actually helps him get to the exit door faster He pulls
himself up using its handle and pushes through into
INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

This might as well be Mount fucking Everest

Sanborn stands chest heaving Staring at the staircase Knows
he has to climb them So he fucking does

EXT MAIN DECK (SECOND LEVEL) - MOMENTS LATER

Sanborn makes his way across the deck

He passes Hangar 3

When he reaches Hangar 4 he stops and leans against it
Panting for breath

He looks back at the distance he’s traveled over the main
deck and sees --

The Woman coming off the staircase onto the main deck
Dammit

Man What to do

Sanborn has no time to think shit through He pushes the door
open to Hangar 4 and falls in

INT HANGAR 4 - CONTINUOUS

Sanborn lays on the floor of the hangar on his chest

He stares at the wall to his left on his stomach

Sees something on it

Looks like a

SANBORN
A button

Yeah It is

Sanborn musters up enough strength to get back to his shaky
legs

He hops over to the door

Locks it

Even though it won’t do much to stop The Woman
Sanborn makes his way over to the button on the wall

He reaches it

And presses it in then --
In the center of the hangar the floor OPENS UP
Sanborn watches as a BLACK CHAIR rises from a hidden recess

SANBORN (CONTD)
The hell

He bounces to the middle of the room for a closer look

The chair looks almost like one you sit in when you’re
getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist

There’s two arm rests each with a rubber handle for your
hands with buttons atop them like joy-sticks

The head rest has a curved metal bar coming out of it witha
MOUTH GUARD on its end that arches over the chair so that the
person sitting in it can bite down on it

And right below the head rest there’s an opening where the
back of your neck would be Positioned in that space is THE
BIGGEST FUCKING NEEDLE I’VE EVER SEEN on a spring loaded
release of some fashion

Sanborn examines the syringe closely
It’s filled with a TRANSLUCENT LIQUID
Sanborn begins to think

MAGNETO MAN (VO)

We studied the brains of our two
male subjects and discovered that
their pineal glands produced a
chemical that wed never seen
before So we extracted it and
began introducing into the brains
of numerous handpicked volunteer
subjects We set up a hangar just
to perform this procedure

SANBORN (VO)
Hangar four

Sanborn looks at the opening below the chair’s head rest
where the needle sits coiled on its spring

MAGNETO MAN (VO)

Yes None of the volunteers

survived the procedure because
(MORE )

MAGNETO MAN (VO) (CONTD)
none of them possessed a specific
dormant brain abnormality to
withstand the introduction of
the chemical into their brain
stems
Sanborn climbs in the chair
MAGNETO MAN (VO)
The other volunteers died
because their descendents were
all frauds They claimed to have
abilities they never possessed
Sanborn grips the handles Looks up at the ceiling
SANBORN
You never lied to me I’m banking
on that now If I’m wrong Id
probably be dead anyway
Sanborn bites down on the mouth guard

He takes a deep breath Centers himself Presses both buttons
on the handles

The NEEDLE SHOOTS THROUGH THE OPENING BELOW THE HEAD REST
THRUSTING INTO THE BASE OF HIS SKULL

Sanborn GROANS in PURE AGONY through the mouth guard as the
translucent liquid is slowly injected into his brain stem
EXT MAIN DECK (SECOND LEVEL) - SAME TIME

The Woman hears Sanborn muffled cries as she walks between
the hangars on the deck

Pin points that they’re emanating from Hangar 4

She beelines directly for it

INT HANGAR 4 - MOMENTS LATER

We are staring at the locked door to Hangar 4
There’s a long beat

Then

BOOM

The door SHUDDERS as something crashes against its other
side
BOOM
It SHUDDERS again
BOOM
And again
Then the door is TORN OFF its hinges
The Woman steps through
Nose bleeding
She stares ahead at --
Sanborn
Laying on the floor in the center of the hangar
Looks like he fell out of the chair onto his stomach
He has a giant RED PUNCTURE MARK on the back of his skull
Is he dead
He GASPS Sucking in a MASSIVE BREATH
Okay

Definitely not dead

His eyes SLAM OPEN
Sanborn picks himself off the floor Slow

Once fully standing he lifts his head and meets eyes with
The Woman across the room

The Woman’s brow furrows as she bores into Sanborn with a
penetrating gaze

His ears begin to leak blood

Sanborn clinches his jaw

He returns The Woman’s stare with one of his own
The Woman starts shaking

And now her ears have started to bleed
Sanborn grins through gritted
He has the ability now too

Shock registers on her face

teeth

But it’s quickly replaced by a look of

The Woman focuses harder

Sanborn starts shaking now

He doubles down his own concentration

Both of their temples start to pulsate

Veins spiderweb up their neck
Blood vessels bursts in their
They are both going kill each
The Woman looks up toward the
Her nose starts to bleed

A METAL SCAFFOLDING BAR SNAPS
hangar

The Woman floats the bar down

and over
eyes
other at

ceiling

determination

their faces

the same time

free up in the rafters of the

from the

ceiling

Until it’s directly hovering behind Sanborn

Its jagged pointed end pointing right at his back

Her nose SPEWS BLOOD while she maneuvers the piece of metal

Sanborn is completely unaware

The Woman’s nose bleed is out of control

Spilling down from her face like a waterfall

Sanborn and The Woman’s heads start to SWELL

They’re skulls are going to pop

Sanborn’s own nose starts to bleed

The Woman can’t wait any longer

She sends the pointed bar flying at

Sanborn’s back

We follow the spear as it rockets towards Sanborn from
behind
Sanborn smiles at The Woman as he --

Steps out of the way of the flying barb just at the right
moment and it --

Skewers The Woman like human a kabob
Bursting out her back with her heart stuck to its tip
The Woman’s JAW DROPS
She looks down at the bar impaled through her chest
Then she looks back up at Sanborn
HARLEY (VO)
Well Now what do you think about
this whole thing
SANBORN (0S)
Im thinking that my Grandma was a
mind reader in a traveling circus
so I know clowns when I see ‘em
He wipes his bloody nose and grins at The Woman
SANBORN (CONT’D)
Grams was legit
(puts two fingers up to
the side of his temple)
An actual real deal Holyfield mind
reader
The Woman realizes Sanborn read her mind
She can’t believe it
The Woman chokes on some of her own blood
Takes one last dying breath
Topples over like a felled tree

Sanborn stares at The Woman laying motionless on the Hangar
floor

Then he looks up at the ceiling

SANBORN (CONTD)
Thanks Grammy

He lowers his head

Starts to hop on his good leg for the exit

EXT CATWALK OIL RIG - NIGHT

The derrick elevator rises to the catwalk

It carries a lone passenger

Harley

Soaked to the gills

Seaweed in her hair

A mess

But

Alive

She steps off the lift onto the platform and sees --
Sanborn

Sitting on his ass

Surrounded by all the headless bodies scattering the deck

HARLEY
John

Sanborn smirks at Harley
SANBORN
Wondering when you’d come up from
your swim
He looks like hell
But somehow manages to wear it well

Harley scans the platform on high alert

HARLEY
Where is she

SANBORN
She’s dead

HARLEY
Really

SANBORN
Really

Harley breathes a sigh of relief

HARLEY
So can we fucking leave now

Sanborn shrugs

SANBORN
Why not

CUT TO

EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

A GIANT TANKER SHIP cuts through black water tugging a
familiar JET FOIL in its wake by a tow chain

SANBORN (0S)
I appreciate you guys giving us a
tow We were dead in the water
until you came along

INT TANKER - PILOT HOUSE

Sanborn and Harley stand in the pilot house of the tanker
with a bearded TANKER CAPTAIN

It’s a hive of activity in here Multiple CREW MEN help
navigate the massive vessel on the sea

TANKER CAPTAIN
You took some substantial hull
damage Couldn’t just leave you to
the fish Especially with one of
you wounded

Sanborn has a torn shirt soaked through with blood wrapped
around his leg wound

SANBORN
It looks a lot worse than it is

TANKER CAPTAIN
I still think you should have our
medic take a look at it-

NAVIGATOR (0C)
CAPTAIN IVE GOT TWO NO THREE NO
FOUR PINGS ON THE SONAR

The Tanker Captain hurries over to THE NAVIGATOR sitting in
front of a SONAR MACHINE
ON ITS SCREEN
The TANKER is flanked by TWO BLIPS on BOTH OF ITS SIDES

CUT TO

EXT TANKER SHIP - NIGHT
TWO SHITTY LOOKING SPEED BOATS sail along side the tanker

Both boats are filled with SOMALI PIRATES armed with AK-47s
and ROCKET LAUNCHERS

GRAPPLING HOOKS are shot up on to the tankers deck
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TANKER

TWO MORE SHITTY SPEED BOATS filled with MORE SOMALI PIRATES
with MORE GUNS fire GRAPPLING HOOKS onto the Tanker

CUT TO

INT BRIG - TANKER SHIP - LATER

The ENTIRE CREW of the tanker ship are on their knees Hands
tied behind their backs Including Sanborn and Harley

A SKINNY SOMALI in a SOCCER JERSEY keeps watch over the crew
holding an AK-47 that weighs more than he does

The Navigator starts CRYING
Soccer Jersey walks over to The Navigator

SOCCER JERSEY
SHUT UP

WHAM
Hits him with the stock of his AK
The Navigator crumples to the floor head bleeding
The Tanker Captain gets to his feet
TANKER CAPTAIN

You didn’t have to do that He’s
just a fucking kid
Soccer Jersey points his AK at the Captain
CHAK-CHAK
Racks the slide

SOCCER JERSEY
YOU Back on your knees

The Tanker Captain lowers himself back on his knees

SOCCER JERSEY (CONTD)
Next person I have to tell
something I shoot
A CREW MEMBER CRIES lowly to himself
Soccer Jersey walks up to the Crew Member
BLAM
Shoots him in the chest
The tanker crew goes dead quiet in the brig
SOCCER JERSEY (CONTD)
I told you Next person I have to
tell something I shoot
Beat
Then

Someone starts LAUGHING

SOCCER JERSEY (CONTD)
Who is that

The LAUGHING gets LOUDER

SOCCER JERSEY (CONTD)
Who’s laughing

It’s Sanborn
Harley nudges him with her elbow
HARLEY
(sotto)
John What are you doing

But Sanborn only laughs HARDER

Soccer Jersey comes up to Sanborn

Sticks his gun in his face

SOCCER JERSEY
Hey What’s so funny

Sanborn stops laughing Looks up at the Somali
SANBORN
What’s funny is that your pirate
pals left you down here alone
Sanborn locks gazes with the Somali pirate
Soccer Jersey starts to bleed from his ear canals
His head RINGS
He drops his AK

SCREEEEEAAAMMMMS

HIS FACE BLASTS APART

And the last thing we see are TWO TERROR-FILLED EYE BALLS

FLYING RIGHT AT US as we --

SLAM TO BLACK
