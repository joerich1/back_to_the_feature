Other Rangers are scattered around the room including
ANDERSON THOMPSON and WEST

Falco sits on Hudson’s arm Hudson FEEDS him

RODRIGUEZ

RODRIGUEZ (CONTD)
She goes down like a sack of slutty
potatoes

TOPP
Wow really Oh man you guys have
gotta take me out on night patrol

HUDSON
No No night duty until you pass
the one year mark That’s Sargent
Muir’s rule

TOPP
Yeah yeah I understand I mean
in Garfield’s first year Jim Davis
didn’t really know what he was
doing The drawings were crude The
jokes were great but not extremely
great But soon enough he found
his voice

Danny ENTERS Takes his spot at the PODIUM

DANNY
All right rangers listen up

All RISE

DANNY (CONT’D)
At ease men

Everyone SITS

DANNY (CONTD)

First order of business I’d like
to congratulate Ranger Topp on
completion of his probationary
period

ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE as Topp takes it in

DANNY (CONT’D)

Second order Those campgrounds at
the perimeter continue to be
targets for delinquents We need to
be extra vigilant with our patrols

RODRIGUEZ
You know Sarge I could position
some motion sensors if you like
DANNY
You and your high tech gimmicks
All a ranger needs is a broad-
brimmed hat and a well-honed sense

of smell

RODRIGUEZ
Hey gadgets come in handy Check
this out

Rodriguez takes out a PEN

RODRIGUEZ (CONTD)
Looks like an ordinary pen right
That is until you press the
clicker

Rodriguez AIMS the pen at Anderson Presses the CLICKER

From the PEN a DART shoots into Ranger Anderson’s NECK
collapses unconscious

RODRIGUEZ (CONTD)
Hell be as good as new in a few
hours Thank you Skymall

Danny TAKES THE PEN from Rodriguez

DANNY
What’s the matter with you

Danny pockets the pen

DANNY (CONT’D)
Technology is no substitute for a
ranger’s will Any other issues

HUDSON
Fish and Game keeps hounding us
when we’re by those lakefront
camps The delinquents like those
camps because they can go skinny
dipping skinny boating and have
skinny sexual intercourse

WEST
What are we supposed to do Sarge

DANNY
Pursue as far as you can Would
Mutt Dandridge have sacrificed the
safety of the park because of Fish
and Game’s bylaws

He
RANGERS
No No sir No he wouldn’t sir

DANNY
All right Dismissed

INT RANGER STATION HALL - DAY

Danny steps out of the briefing room DECEMBER RAINES 20s-
30s a beautiful park staffer waits for him They walk down
the hall together

DECEMBER
You shouldn’t be so dismissive of
technology Danny

DANNY
Were you listening in on our
briefing

DECEMBER

How else am I supposed to get any
information You’re not exactly an
open book

DANNY
If I wanted to live a high-tech
life I wouldn’t be a park ranger
Id be an internet maker or a cell
phone polisher

DECEMBER
Don’t be such a cynic Sometimes
technology is about connecting
people Together

She smiles at him He smiles back

DANNY
So what’s on the docket this
morning

December looks at her agenda

DECEMBER

Noise disturbance near the
lakefront camp 17 Shinra logging
says they’ve got a protester they
were hoping you could pay a visit

(beat)
And Supreme Commander Kleinwebber
is here
Danny stops in his tracks Stunned

DECEMBER (CONTD)
She showed up unannounced She’s in
your office

DANNY
No calls

INT DANNY’S OFFICE - DAY

A messy office Danny enters SUPREME COMMANDER NANCY

KLEINWEBBER 50s sits on the other side of his desk

Danny SALUTES

NANCY
At ease Sargent Have a seat

Danny maneuvers around his desk and SITS

Danny looks at a PORTRAIT on the wall Underneath it

JOHN MUIR

DANNY
What brings you to Warren G Harding
National Park Supreme Commander

NANCY
Let’s cut the bullshit formalities
As you know the National Park
Service has been in dire financial
straits for years The economy has
finally made things come to a head

DANNY
What are you talking about

NANCY
Cost cutting Danny People just
aren’t willing to spend money to go
to national parks Not in this
climate The Department of the
Interior has designated 10
unprofitable parks as candidates
for removal from federal
protection Warren G Harding is at
the top of the list We’re going to
be vetting a private investor to
buy out the park grounds

DANNY
Private investor My God

reads --
DANNY (CONT’D)
My great-great grandfather must be
spinning in his grave

NANCY
Your great-great grandfather was a
great-great man But he’s a relic
of a different time The 19th
century Women couldn’t vote
People shit in an outhouse into a
bucket or failing that into a
hole dug in the ground Napoleon
wasn’t a delicious ice cream hybrid
of vanilla chocolate and
strawberry but rather the
megalomaniacal emperor of France

DANNY
I think you mean “Neapolitan”

NANCY
Jonathan Taylor Thomas was a
century away from being a megastar
If you said the word “microwave”
people would think you meant a
modest greeting or what might
happen in a tiny ocean If you
mentioned the phrase “world wide
web” whoever was listening would
assume some kind of horrifying
giant spider was involved

DANNY
Fine Just tell me what this means
for me

NANCY
It’s still in the proposal stage
If you can improve attendance and
revenues who knows But I’ve got a
gut feeling this is gonna go
through

Nancy TOSSES HIM A FILE

NANCY (CONTD)
I took the liberty of scheduling
you a meeting with a prospective
buyer He’s the CEO of the Global
Petroleum Initiative Corporation

DANNY
An oil company This is insane

NANCY
Theyve assured us they will
preserve the sanctity of these park
grounds Now if you’1l excuse me
I’ve gotta go take a shit Indoors
Into a toilet Because it’s the
21st century So before you advance
your outdated philosophy think
about me taking a big creamy shit

Nancy STANDS AND EXITS Danny studies the FILE

EXT SAN FRANCISCO CITYSCAPE - DAY

Skyscrapers tower over the bay Focus on the tallest -- GPIC
WORLD HEADQUARTERS

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The ornate conference room of a Fortune 500 company
BUSINESSMEN and BUSINESSWOMEN pack every seat at the table

A FIGURE sits at the head of the table His chair is turned
to the back of the rest of the room We don’t see him yet

MR HORWITZ a silent stoic imposing bodyguard stands
behind him

A NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN finishes up a Powerpoint presentation

NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN
And so in conclusion with
diminished supply margins on
petroleum extraction will continue
to decline For GPIC to sustain
itself your firm must expand into
renewable energy And speaking on
behalf of the entire EPA our
agency is eager to help you make
that transition

Nervous Businessman ADVANCES THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
There’s a slide of PORKY PIG

NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN (CONT’D)
Otherwise your investors will be
saying th-th-that’s all folks

No one laughs Long silence

HEAD OF TABLE (0S)
Why did you join the Environmental
Protection Agency Mr Joffrey Are
you a nature lover

NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN
Um I guess so I own both Free
Willy DVDs

Mr Horwitz starts to walk toward Nervous Businessman

HEAD OF TABLE (0S)
You know what’s beautiful about
nature It’s self-correcting
There’s no debate over policy No
obtuse regulations No government
bureaucracies The most efficient
practices -- in hunting gathering
food mating -- are naturally
adopted In a way nature is the
perfect free market economy

NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN
Sir

HEAD OF TABLE (0S)
Mr Joffrey we need to acquire new
sources of oil There’s no scarcity
of supply only government
constraints on where we’ve been
able to drill But due to some
effective targeted lobbying were
now in a position to pursue these
sources -- in formerly so-called
protected lands THAT is how we
maintain profitability Not by
complying with your useless --
unnatural -- EPA guidelines

Mr Horwitz now stands right next to Nervous Businessman
NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN
What -- what you’re talking about

is pillaging nature

HEAD OF TABLE (0S)
No What I’m talking about is --

The chair spins around We see the head of the table --
BURROUGHS He wears a surgical mask over his mouth always

BURROUGHS
Survival of the fittest

Mr Horwitz TAPES NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN’S MOUTH and PULLS A SACK
OVER HIS HEAD He DRAGS HIM OUT OF THE ROOM

NERVOUS BUSINESSMAN (0S)
(muffled screams)
Mmmff MMMMFFFF

The DOORS SLAM behind them The others at the table react
Shock but they’ve seen this before

BURROUGHS
Who arranged this farce

BUSINESSWOMAN meekly raises her hand

BUSINESSWOMAN
The -- the EPA said it was
mandatory for all energy companies
I had no choice

BURROUGHS
Well then you can explain to the
EPA why their liaison wont be
returning to his post Make it
believable Because if they come
around here asking questions -- you
can find out where he ended up
Firsthand Meeting dismissed

All STAND AND EXIT tense and terrified

EXT CAMPGROUND - DAY

Rodriguez and Topp get out of their PATROL TRUCK and walk
through the campground The lake is in sight

They walk toward a campsite A group of DELINQUENTS are
drinking and smoking pot

TOPP
Good afternoon folks A few or
your neighboring camps made some
complaints about the noise level
over here

DELINQUENT 1
Go fuck yourself forest pig

RODRIGUEZ
Sounds like you guys are partying a
little too hard

DELINQUENT 2
Sounds like you guys need to learn
that partying too hard is literally
impossible That’s the dictionary
definition of literal

RODRIGUEZ
All right you fucking punks We
can do this the easy way --

Rodriguez draws his net gun

RODRIGUEZ (CONTD)
Or the net way

The Delinquents react They’re not sure what to do

Suddenly two FISH AND GAME OFFICIALS enter carrying a case
of beer

These are BRODSKY head of Fish and Game and his deputy
RYAN They are both big and hairy

BRODSKY
All right you puss-puss bitches
want to keep this party going

Brodsky notices the Rangers

BRODSKY (CONTD)
Oh Hey If it isn’t the tree
police What’s the matter ladies
Someone kidnap a leaf

Ryan and the Delinquents LAUGH Rodriguez and Topp react

RODRIGUEZ
We’ve had numerous complaints about
drunkenness excessive cursing and
public urination You have violated
numerous park statutes including C-
P 824 dot --

Brodsky turns to Topp

BRODSKY
I don’t believe we’ve met ranger
You must be new around here Cody
Brodsky chief of the Department of
Fish and Game Is there a problem

TOPP
Does Garfield kick Odie off the
kitchen table

BRODSKY
Well you see we’re within 10
meters of the lake shore Which
means you’re in Fish and Game’s
jurisdiction So whether there’s a
problem or not -- well I don’t
think that’s your call to make

RYAN
Maybe we should take these rangers
into custody Trespassing on
lakefront property
Brodsky gets in their faces

BRODSKY
So I ask again Is there a problem

Rodriguez barely contains his anger Topp is worried

RODRIGUEZ

No No problem Enjoy your stay at

the lake You motherfuckers
BRODSKY

Go home bark boys Go stick your

wiener in a knothole and rub a

pinecone on your balls

Rodriguez CHARGES Brodsky Topp HOLDS HIM BACK

TOPP
Let’s go He’s not worth it

They walk away frustrated

RODRIGUEZ
Fuckin’ Fish and Game

Delinquents throw BOTTLES at them and LAUGH

EXT FOREST ROAD - DAY
Danny drives his patrol truck solo He passes a SIGN
It reads -- NOW EXITING PROTECTED FOREST

The forest abruptly thins He’s in the midst of a commercial
logging area LOGGERS and LOGGING TRUCKS are all around

Danny turns off road and drives through the logging area He
reaches a clearing where one REDWOOD TREE stands alone

EXT CLEARING - DAY

Danny steps out of his truck There are loggers looking up at
the TREE

HIGH UP IN THE TREE
There’s a makeshift TREEHOUSE and PLATFORM
A logger FOREMAN approaches Danny

FOREMAN
You the ranger

DANNY
Yeah Sargent Danny Muir National
Park Service She up there

FOREMAN

Danny walks up to the tree He yells up to it

DANNY (CONTD)
Hello up there

A hippie girl emerges from the makeshift house This is
SALLY 20s beautiful

SALLY
Hey Are you another one of those
tree murderers

DANNY
No I’m a park ranger My names
Danny Muir

SALLY
Oh cool I’m Sally And as for the
rest of you you’re all torturers
at this tree Gitmo End the tree
holocaust

LOGGERS

to Phish Idiot

Danny motions for them to back off They all step back

DANNY
Listen we got a complaint that you
were up here Now park grounds end
about a click up the road This
territory is legally leased by the
Shinra corporation for commercial
logging I told them I’d talk to
you as a favor because they told
me you refuse to negotiate
Instead you call them things like
well wood rapists

SALLY
Well that’s what they are

DANNY
Well no matter what you think
about THEM I’m someone who cares
about trees just as much as you do

SALLY
Oh yeah Do you love trees

DANNY
Of course

SALLY
Do you consider chopping down a
sapling the moral equivalent of
forced abortion

DANNY
No But I certainly would never
intentionally chop down a sapling

SALLY
Okay Would you either marry or gay-
marry a tree and then try and have
half-human half-tree children and
love them even if they were
functionally retarded

DANNY
Probably not I see numerous
problems with that idea

SALLY
Yeah me neither Just wondering
where you draw the line Wow I
guess you do care about trees
DANNY
Yeah So -- do you think you can
come down from there Let these
loggers cut down the tree they own

SALLY
No This tree is over 90 meters
tall That means it’s over --

DANNY
600 years old

SALLY
Yeah So you know I mean it’s
beautiful I can’t let them turn
this into the wood paneling for a
hot tub that some fat swingers are
just gonna have fat sloppy swinger
sex in

DANNY
I understand But can you at least
stop calling them things like --

Danny reads from some notes

DANNY (CONTD)
Axe-wielding footsoldiers for the
anti-tree Gestapo

SALLY
Yeah I guess so Hey you know
you seem like a really cool guy
Plus you’re ruggedly handsome Like
the Brawny paper towel mascot only
you’re not an empty corporate
shill You know if you’re ever
bored and you want to chat you
should come on by

DANNY
Maybe I’11 do that

Danny returns to the Foreman

DANNY (CONTD)
I tried She’s not coming down

FOREMAN
Goddamnit Stupid hippies All

sector for now

The loggers GRUMBLE as they gather up their equipment

it down on the cutting board

BURROUGHS (CONTD)
The dish is sashimi

BURROUGHS
As head of operations at the

revamped park youll draw a

substantially increased salary
(MORE)

BURROUGHS (CONTD)
And your existing staff will be
retained given full benefits and
GPIC stock options And most
importantly -- you’1ll have the good
feeling of being proud members of
the private sector

DANNY
I’m sorry Mr Burroughs This is
contrary to everything the name
Muir stands for

BURROUGHS
The name Muir stands for
conservation of resources
Preservation of land I’m offering
you both -- with some minor caveats
for the sake of profitability

DANNY
What you’re offering is tantamount
to the destruction of this forest
I’m sorry I can’t stand for it

BURROUGHS
Very well But I know your
finances You’re hemorrhaging
money If you lose federal support
this park goes bankrupt And once
that happens -- you go from being a
negotiating partner --

Burroughs picks up a slimy bit of salmon He pulls his mask
forward just slightly and slurps the fish into his mouth

planning for every contingency
(MORE)
BURROUGHS (CONTD)
Our internal numbers estimate two
billion barrels of oil underneath
this forest -- that’s half as much
as in ANWR in one-twentieth of the
area This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for domestic oil
exploration You’re wondering what
I’1ll do now and Ill give you the
answer I always give -- I’1ll do
whatever I have to In fact I’ve
already started

ON THE ROAD AHEAD

There’s a SQUIRREL idling in the middle of the road

best

DANNY

GROANS from the rangers

DANNY (CONTD)
I know I know But look this is a
PR disaster when we need it least
Nothing drives campers away faster

than unsafe conditions
(MORE)

DANNY (CONT’D)
And more importantly ensuring park
safety is a ranger’s sworn duty

DECEMBER
Sargent I don’t understand Over
the past ten years we’ve had the
best animal attack record west of
the Rockies

RODRIGUEZ
Isn’t that a bad thing

HUDSON
No she means best meaning least
number of attacks I think Right

DECEMBER
Yes that’s what I meant

RODRIGUEZ
See to me when you say best
animal attack record I’m thinking
that’s who had the most attacks
Which would make the worst one the

best one
WEST

Yeah -- that makes sense to me
HUDSON

How does that make sense
DECEMBER

Look what’s important is -- how do

we stop this

DANNY

We won’t know how until we ID the
animal Which means we’re gonna
have to catch us one

Can’t you recondition him De-
program him

PHYSICIAN
I’ve worked with traumatic brain
injury patients people with
neurological diseases This man is
as far gone as you can get and
still be conscious Getting him to
be normal again would be like
training a bear to drive a car

DANNY
You can do that

It’s a little car but still

PHYSICIAN
Okay then -- like getting a dog to
drive a car

INT RANGER STATION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
A press conference room December quiets the REPORTERS

DECEMBER
Everyone please Thank you Last
night an elite unit of park
rangers captured the suspect we
believe responsible for the recent
attack on a camper

REPORTER 1
Suspect I thought this was an
animal attack

DECEMBER
If you’1ll allow me to finish We
believe these attacks have been
carried out by a human being From
fingerprints matched to federal
databases we have identified him
as Scott Joffrey a former employee
of the EPA

December cues up a POWERPOINT SLIDE It’s a PHOTO of the
Nervous Businessman It’s an attempt at a sexy self-portrait
where he’s obviously holding the camera like the kind teen
girls put up on social networking sites

DECEMBER (CONTD)
This is a picture of the suspect we
acquired from his Facebook profile
It’s dated February of last year
and captioned “Hope I got my good
side LOL”

Next slide -- the feral Nervous Businessman restrained in the
hospital room Ferocious animalistic

GASPS from the room

DECEMBER (CONTD)
And here he is last night after his
capture Perhaps due to mental
illness Mr Joffrey has completely
crossed the line separating animal
and man

Next slide -- The word MAN on the left side and the word
ANIMAL on the right side

DECEMBER (CONT’D)
He has become --

Slide animates -- the words MAN and ANIMAL move toward each
other until the “AN” in MAN and the “AN” in ANIMAL overlap

DECEMBER (CONT’D)
A beastperson

She advances the slide It changes to the word BEASTPERSON

(beat)
Look we got bigger fish to fry
Fish and Game and whoever they’re
working for knew a lot more than
they should They staged that
delinquent orgy and phoned in a
phony report knowing we’d respond
They knew our escape routes and
were lying in wait to cut us off

DANNY (CONTD)
The only way they could’ve pulled
all this off is if someone in this
very park -- is a rat

Pandemonium The rangers STAND AND SHOUT at each other
Rodriguez shouts over everyone

RODRIGUEZ
Enough Whoever this fuckin’ rat
is come right out and say it --
right here right now so I can
deal with you myself

HUDSON
You seem pretty agitated
Rodriguez Maybe you’re looking to
deflect attention After all
weren’t you the one who was with
him when he got nabbed Maybe you
know more than you let on

Rodriguez stands up out of his chair and charges Hudson who
eggs him on The others hold both of them back

HUDSON (CONT’D)
Come on

DANNY

They calm Rodriguez down

WEST
Everyone take it easy Let’s not

birds am I right

Hudson charges West and is held back

DANNY

forgotten you were a hawk handler

RODRIGUEZ
Yeah West has a lot on his mind --
what with taking care of his
wheelchair son and all

West charges Rodriguez
RODRIGUEZ (CONTD)

statement of fact
ANDERSON

that Short Circuit is a bad movie
Rodriguez and Thompson both charge Anderson
THOMPSON
It wasn’t great but it was better
than the sequel

West charges Thompson

WEST
My dad wrote the sequel

DANNY
Take it easy Take it easy

The cops continue to charge each other as Danny makes
futile attempt to separate them

INT CONCRETE ROOM - NIGHT
DARKNESS Topp wakes up tied to a chair Struggles
LIGHTS ON

Topp’s eyes adjust to the light His mouth is TAPED OVER He
sees two people in front of him

Burroughs and Mr Horwitz

BURROUGHS
Good evening

Topp gets scared Tries to free himself It’s futile

BURROUGHS (CONTD)
Ranger -- Topp is it Capturing
you was almost too easy Maybe you
rangers don’t have the stomach for
a real fight

Burroughs NODS Mr Horwitz PULLS THE TAPE off Topp’s mouth

TOPP

number two

BURROUGHS
Tell me Topp Do you believe in
Danny Muir

TOPP
I really gotta poop man

BURROUGHS
Do you believe in Danny Muir

TOPP
Yes Sarge helps protect nature

BURROUGHS
Nature doesn’t need his protection
But what would you know See I’ma
lion at the top of the food chain
And you -- your salary paid by tax
dollars -- you are a leech

TOPP
I’m not a leech I’m a cat A cat
who likes lasagna

Burroughs CHUCKLES

BURROUGHS
Do you know why I wear this mask

TOPP
Everyone told me it was allergies

BURROUGHS

Allergies Allergies No no See
when I was a small boy I was
visiting a national park much like
yours I wandered off from my
family and stumbled upon something
shiny Yellow It was a honeycomb
Not knowing any better I brought
it up to my mouth to have a taste
of sweet honey And just when Id
gotten my face good and sticky --
That’s when the bees attacked They
swarmed my face stinging me over
and over and over again And then
a bear arrived He clawed at the
bees on my face -- to get to the
small amount of honey on my lips
He clawed and scratched and bit
they swarmed and stung the bees
and bear warring over honey on the
battlefield of my face And then
the badgers showed up

(beat)
I woke up after nineteen hours of
surgery And my face looked like
this

Burroughs RIPS OFF HIS MASK We don’t see what’s underneath
It’s more horrifying than anything Topp’s ever imagined

TOPP
AUUGGGHHHHH

Topp keeps SCREAMING Burroughs talks over him

BURROUGHS
Nature is ruthless Nature will
disfigure a small boy’s face over a
morsel of food Nature doesn’t need
protection Nature needs to be
subdued by man

TOPP

Oh I’m poopin’ everywhere You owe

me a new pair of pants Burroughs

You owe me a pair of pants

She BREAKS DOWN SOBBING

DECEMBER (CONT’D)
This wasn’t supposed to happen

Danny STANDS and PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HER

DANNY

I know But we’re dealing with an
adversary who’s malicious Evil I

the most rotten at the core And

have to be willing to do anything

logistics Chief Brodsky

RYAN
Look draining all that water is
gonna ruin the lake’s ecosystem
BRODSKY
Yeah I mean if that happens the
lake will never be the same

BURROUGHS
That’s the plan We drain the lake
flood the park and render it
uninhabitable Then we sell all
the dead fish to pet food companies
in Mexico And then we pave over
our privately owned lake bed It
will make an ideal storage
reservoir for surplus oil barrels
Far more profitable than a
stagnant filthy puddle of water

RYAN
You can’t do that

BURROUGHS
Yes I can And you’re going to
help That’s why I’m making you
rich beyond your wildest dreams

RYAN
My dreams involve jetskis and beer
What good are those without a lake
to ride around and get drunk on
