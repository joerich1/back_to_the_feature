MY NAME IS BRUCE

Screenplay by Mark Verheiden

EXT SAWVILLE - DUSK

OPEN on green hills hidden under mysterious swathes of
ground fog There’s an eerie quiet as the sun sinks and
the shadows lengthen

PAN DOWN to a “Welcome To Sawville Population 2649”
sign The city’s motto “We Came We Sawed We
Prospered” scrolls over a cartoon image of a sawmill
Suddenly an entire 12 pack of

EGGS splat the sign yolk dripping as we HEAR METAL MUSIC
and a KID WHOOPING over the ROAR of a pick-up truck

INT PICK-UP - NIGHT

In the truck two teenagers (CLAYTON and JEFF) roar down
a back road Jeff wearing an EVIL DEAD tee shirt is
driving As they approach a row of

RURAL MAIL BOXES

Clayton sporting a John Deere cap finishes a beer
tosses the empty and grabs a baseball bat from behind the
driver’s seat noticing a pile of DVDs and comic books

CLAYTON
Thought I told you to ditch all
this monster movie stuff

JEFF
What’s wrong with it

CLAYTON
Sheesus Jeff

As they pass the mailboxes Clayton leans out the window
and swings smashing the boxes and sending plumes of
letters into the air

CLAYTON (CONTD)
Mail’s in
(back to Jeff)
when are you going to grow up
I’m trying to get you laid but
how’s that going to happen when
first thing the chick sees is

“Bruce Campbell”
JEFF
What did you say
EXT ROAD - NIGHT
Jeff suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and the truck fishtails
to a stop dust washing up over the cab

INT PICK-UP

As Clayton lurches forward then back Jeff glares him

JEFF
Take it back

CLAYTON

JEFF

Bruce Campbell is the greatest
actor of his generation

CLAYTON
You’re kidding right
(going through boxes)
“Mindtrap” “Alien Apocalypse”
“Cavealien”

JEFF
(defensive)
Shut up That’s a good one

Clayton flips the box dramatically reading the blurb

CLAYTON
“Bruce Campbell IS Lt Jack
Stryker a rogue clone-warrior and
mankind’s last hope against the
deadly Cavealiens”

JEFF
Yeah So

CLAYTON
Dude forget thumbs Ebert
wouldn’t wipe his crack with this
trash

Jeff grabs the DVD away from him angry

JEFF
Get out of the truck

CLAYTON
Whoa slow down

JEFF
You don’t like Bruce you walk

CLAYTON
I loved Army Of Darkness

JEFF
Everybody loved that one
(anger abating)
But all right

CLAYTON
(a whew )
Now could we please go get laid

Jeff begrudgingly puts the truck into gear headlights
stabbing the shadows as they careen down the dusty road

EXT OLD CHINESE GRAVEYARD - DUSK

TIME PASSES and the truck’s headlights wash across the
dilapidated arches of an old GRAVEYARD As the truck
rolls through the arches pan across another

OLD HALF-ROTTED SIGN

identifying this new location cryptically with some
painted Asian characters along with a few broken English
words of warning PRO ECTE FO THOSE WH DIE BEWA E
HOSE WITHOUT EAN URD (Protected for those who died
Beware those without bean curd”) As

HEADLIGHTS stab the moonlit darkness Jeffs pick-up
SMASHES OVER the sign and skids to a stop PULL OUT to
reveal a

DILAPIDATED CHINESE GRAVEYARD nestled in the shadow of a
tall hill Rotted sticks with faded Chinese characters
jut from the ground Barely visible somewhere in the
background is a long abandoned mine-shaft barely visible
in the mountainside After a moment

JEFF STEPS OUT OF THE TRUCK flashlight in hand The
BEAM dances through the darkness and across the grave
markers some tagged with wisps of tattered cloth others
broken and jagged As Jeff moves up to one of the
markers staring at it

SOMEONE SUDDENLY GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND

Jeff JUMPS UP with a SCREAM and turns his light
revealing LITTLE DEBBIE A creepy teenage Goth chick

with multiple piercings and heavy mascara

LITTLE DEBBIE
You scream like a girl

Next to her looms another teenager BIG DEBBIE Shes
REAL big well over six feet Their car’s parked nearby

hidden by the darkness

LITTLE DEBBIE (CONT’D)

(eying graves)
Come on Big Debbie Let’s check
it out

The Debbies exchange excited “let’s check it out” looks

and bolt to explore the graveyard

JEFF
Who are they

CLAYTON
Big Debbie and Little Debbie
From the Apple Festival

JEFF
I thought they blew us off

CLAYTON
They blew you off “Evil Dead”
(nods at Goth girl)
When I told the Mascara Queen
about this old boneyard she
practically dry-humped me on the
spot

JEFF
She’s kind of cute

Clayton notices Jeff’s anxioushorny look

CLAYTON
Don’t worry hard-on Morticia’s
all yours
(eyes on Big Debbie)
I’m going human fly on that
skyscraper

As they follow the girls into the graveyard Goth “Little

Debbie” hesitates looking across the stones

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 5

CLAYTON (CONTD)
The graves haven’t been touched in
years We’re all alone out here

LITTLE DEBBIE
(reverent)
It looks ancient Historic This
place must have meant a lot to
these people

Suddenly Little Debbie gleefully KICKS DOWN a grave
marker

LITTLE DEBBIE (CONT’D)
Let’s break something

JEFF
As long as it’s not my heart

Jeff makes his move on Goth Little Debbie He’s doing a
faux Bruce Campbell riff but Little Debbie stomping
apart ancient grave markers couldn’t care less

JEFF (CONTD)
What do you say Gimme some
sugar baby

LITTLE DEBBIE
What

Jeff gets in front of her Working it

JEFF
Come on We can dance the “hard
to get” all night but if this
game’s called eye-tag

Jeff takes Little Debbie in his arms staring with
smoldering Campbell-esque intensity into her eyes

JEFF (CONTD)
--your lips say I’m “it”

Little Debbie stares at him almost like she’s
succumbing then she suddenly SPITS her gum in his face
As it bounces off his nose Jeff releases Little Debbie
and she runs across the graveyard

JEFF (CONTD)
Mmm Juicy Fruit

As the girls move off laughing and throwing “you freak”
looks at Jeff Clayton leans close to Jeff

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 6

CLAYTON
Smocoooth “Brucie”

Clayton takes off across the old graveyard with the
Debbies laughing as they vandalize more Chinese graves
Jeff just stands there struggling to maintain his
Campbell-esque cool

JEFF
Your loss baby Your loss

Grumpy Jeff picks up his flashlight and continues across
the graveyard stumbling toward an

OLD MINE SHAFT

Broken timbers surround a landslide of boulders that have
completely blocked the entrance As his flashlight
washes across the rocks something GLISTENS Jeff turns
like he wants to tell the others he’s found something
but in the

GRAVEYARD all he can see are flickers of flashlights
dancing across the darkness and distant mocking VOICES

CLAYTON (0S)
(distant)
“Here lies Hung Far Low he dug
too deep no Low no-mo”

As LAUGHTER rings across the old graveyard Jeff kneels
and grabs at the shiny object pulling It’s jammed in
tight some sort of

SHINY AMULET While Clayton and the girls continue to
yell in the darkness Jeff pulls harder really putting
himself into it finally YANKING the amulet free As
Jeff rolls back on his ass

CAMERA pushes through the small hole into the avalanche
of rocks

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Camera zooms in through the rock-slide around wet cave
walls past a broken HUMAN SKULL until it closes on dark
red circle It might just be a strange formation in the

rock until

TWO RED DEMONIC EYES SUDDENLY OPEN
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 7

EXT OLD CHINESE GRAVEYARD

Jeff backs away from the rock wall studying the amulet
with his flashlight as he moves back into the graveyard
Closer examination shows some faded CHINESE ETCHINGS in
the metal and a glowering demonic face

JEFF
Groovy

Suddenly Jeff hears the faint rumble of falling rock
just behind him Surprised Jeff turns and shines his
light on the face of the

MINE SHAFT A few pebbles and a puff of dust roll down
Doesn’t look like much and after watching for a second
Jeff shrugs and looks back toward the graveyard

JEFF (CONTD)
Hey --

OUT OF FOCUS behind Jeff more rocks move as something
seems to be clawing free from the rubble Jeff turns
his eyes going wide as the rocks rumble free and there’s
an awful unearthly ROAR

JEFF (CONT’D)
OH CHRIST SHIT

Terrified Jeff bolts tucking the talisman in his pocket
as he scrambles toward the

GRAVEYARD Hearing Jeffs cries Clayton (his hand
clamped firmly on Big Debbie’s boob) and the two girls
look over assuming it’s a prank

CLAYTON
Son of a

JEFF
HOLY JESUS CRAPPING HELL RUN FOR
YOUR LIVES

As Jeff races by an oblivious Clayton continues to
fondle Big Debbie

CLAYTON
Wha

Suddenly a SWORD SWOOSHES across frame BLOOD SPRAYS

Stunned Big Debbie looks down at the hand still
clutching her boob and realizes it’s been

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 8

CHOPPED OFF AT THE WRIST As she SCREAMS the mystic
blade suddenly SLASHES across her throat blood gushing
from the wound

JEFF races toward the pick-up as Big Debbie’s scream
stops Suddenly something large and bloody FLIES over
his head

CRASHING WITH A GOOEY SPLAT against the back of the
truck As Jeff runs up his flashlight finds Little
Debbie’s broken bloodied body lying in a heap Sticks
of Juicy Fruit spilling from her coat pocket

JEFF
SHIT
INT PICK-UP - NIGHT
Scared Jeff jumps into the truck fumbling for the keys
He fires it up engine roaring reaching for the

gearshift when

CLAYTON staggers to the window smearing the glass with
blood gushing from his severed arm clearly in shock

CLAYTON
Don’t leave me man

JEFF

AHHHH
There’s another unearthly ROAR from the released DEMON
Terrified Jeff PUNCHES IT As the truck tears gravel a
scared Jeff looks in the rearview and sees
CLAYTON staggering in the dust illuminated by the
truck’s red tail lights As Clayton staggers arm
gushing blood a large FIGURE surrounded by swirling
windswept robes RAISES A SWORD

IN THE TRUCK Jeff can’t look as he drives crazily Bruce
Campbell DVD’s sliding around on the seat

INT SOUNDSTAGE (EXT WOODS) - NIGHT

TIGHT on Bruce Campbell shouting into the darkness

BRUCE
Hold it right there

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 9

For an instant we think Bruce is yelling at Jeff But
then we pull back revealing that Bruce is wearing some
quasi-futuristic coveralls (CAVE PATROL patch on the
shoulder) and he’s yelling at

PETRA a sultry blonde with a thick Russian accent
wearing the same uniform

PETRA
Vat’s wrong vith you Stryker
We’ve got the Cavealien cornered

(“Cavealien” is pronounced as one word) PULL BACK to
reveal Bruce and Petra standing out a cave opening
totally unlike the mine shaft at the beginning

BRUCE
So transmit the scans up to Delta-
Baker plant some bio-blasters and
send out for Chinese Your
Colonial Jarheads can handle the
shake and bake

PETRA
Col Packer’s still trapped down
there

Bruce throws a sarcastic look toward the cave

BRUCE
Knew there was a reason I got up
this morning

PETRA
You bastard

BRUCE
Hey Last time I saw Packer he
tried to put me in front of a
firing squad

Petra SLAPS Bruce across the face
PETRA
Coward I should have left you on
Regula Nine

As she swings to slap him again Bruce catches her hand

BRUCE
We both know you couldn’t do that

Petra doesn’t pull away Her expression says she knows
Bruce is right

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 10

PETRA
I still can’t believe a loser like
you vas cloned from one of my dead
husbands cells

BRUCE
That’s right baby They built me
out of your old man’s DNA So how
about we share a little mouth to
mouth

PETRA
You’re dees-gusting

BRUCE
I’m aman And I’ve been wanting
to do this ever since we landed on
this rock

As Bruce kisses her Petra reluctantly then
enthusiastically accepts his kiss The erotic moment
interrupted by a gurgling NOISE off screen

PETRA
What the --

Bruce whips out his “blaster”

BRUCE
Dammit They’re all around us

Petra throws a sarcastic look at Bruce

PETRA
Vooks like you get to play soldier-
boy after all

A gelatinous MONSTER suddenly appears behind Petra
rubbery tendrils flailing Bruce aims his futuristic
blaster and

FIRES A SPARKY BLAST into the beast Hit the monster
ejaculates a great spew of alien goo A gout hits Bruce
in the face and he reacts with disgust then SURPRISE as
MORE and MORE alien glop geysers from the monster’s
wound

BRUCE
Je-sus H

Bruce raises his hands to fend off the ridiculous amount
of “alien blood”

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 11

BRUCE (CONTD)
Easy on the ichor I think we get
the point

DIRECTOR
Okay cut

PULL BACK to reveal the cave is actually a low budget
movie set for the movie CAVEALIEN (cave-alien) 2 The

DIRECTOR a younger guy with a boyish attitude and
glasses a half inch thick walks onto the set as Bruce
coughs up the last of the alien goo

DIRECTOR (CONTD)
That was aces Bruce Nice work

The myopic Director keeps walking running head first
into a fake tree He bounces back like this happens all
the time

BRUCE
(wiping off goo)
You didn’t think it was a little
over the top

The Director blinks behind his thick glasses

DIRECTOR
It’s Cavealien 2

BRUCE
That’s not an answer

DIRECTOR
Did you see Cavealien 1

As the Director moves on Bruce notices an overweight
male PA standing by craft services

BRUCE
Hey Tiny Fetch me a lemon
water will ya

The PA grabs a bottle from a nearby cooler and quickly
passes it over Bruce gives the bottle a glance and
tosses it back at the PA annoyed

BRUCE (CONTD)
Lemon Le-mon
(as PA hesitates)
Let’s go Jumbo Ondelay
ondelay

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 12

The annoyed PA moves off toward a craft services cart
as Petra comes up Bruce continues to “drip” goo through-
out this scene

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hey baby nice work On a show
this down and dirty it’s a relief
to be working with a professional

Even out of character Petra has the Russian accent

PETRA
(withering)
I vouldn’t know

Bruce raises his hands “take it easy” style
accidentally spattering her with goo

BRUCE
Easy Quick-Draw We’re both on
the same page

PETRA
Veally

BRUCE
Sure baby Low budget show like
this is just a detour A quick
cash infusion while Scorsese and
Spielberg are warming up our

chairs
PETRA
Who
Bruce blinks
BRUCE

Sounds like you could use a little
filmmaking 101 Lucky for you
the Professor is in

(seductive)
I know this little bar off
Cahuenga where the drinks are
cheap and the barmaids are
cheaper

BRRRING Petra gets a call on her cell She takes it
cutting Bruce off in mid-sentence

PETRA
Hullo Vhy yes
(eying Bruce)

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 13

PETRA (CONTD)
No you’re not ee-nterrupting
anything

As Petra wanders off cooing into her phone

BRUCE
(calling after her)
Think it over

Bruce looks out across the location hands on his hips
“in charge” as the DP adjusts the lens on the camera

BRUCE (CONTD)
Jimmy I’m thinking we should go
with a ‘50 for this next shot

DP
Got one up your ass

BRUCE
(considers then)
Maybe a ‘75

As Bruce continues to “consider” lens choices

TINY THE ANGRY PA is standing to one side grinning
evilly as he pees lemon-green urine into an empty “Lemon
Water” bottle OFF this

EXT SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

Bruce dressed in gaudy civilian clothes as shooting
wraps for the day exits the soundstage only to find
himself suddenly surrounded by a gaggle of devoted

FANS Practically wetting themselves in Bruce’s presence
Geek central NO GIRLS Not in the mood for a fan
encounter Bruce forces a wan smile as he wades through
them

FANS
Bruce Mr Campbell Ash

Always prepared Bruce whips out a stack of 8 x 10’s and
starts dealing them out like a poker player

BRUCE
Here ya go one for you one for

As the fan in front of Bruce cluelessly sniffs his own
armpits Bruce reaches in his pocket and hands him a
stick of Right Guard

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 14

BRUCE (CONTD)
It’s called deodorant Look it up
on your “internets”
(passing more photos)
Don’t worry I’ve got enough for
all you little trolls

A fan in a wheelchair rolls up and Bruce hands him a
photo The Wheelchair Fan thrusts it right back mega-
demanding

WHEELCHAIR FAN
Mr Campbell Mr Campbell How
about an autograph

The Wheelchair Fan holds out Bruce’s 8 x 10 but there’s
no pen

WHEELCHAIR FAN (CONT’D)
What no pen

Bruce rolls his eyes and slides out a pen scrawling his
signature

WHEELCHAIR FAN (CONT’D)
Say cheese

Before Bruce can answer he’s BLINDED by a flash

BRUCE
Gahhhh

WHEELCHAIR FAN
How about five bucks for the bus

Blinking his eyes clearing Bruce glares at the kid

BRUCE
Ever hear the theme from
“Rawhide”

WHEELCHAIR FAN
Huh

Bruce lifts his foot and gives the fan’s wheelchair a
shove sending him rolling backward down the sidewalk

BRUCE
“Keep them doggies rollin’”

As Bruce continues ahead he’s trailed by the fans and
peppered with more inane questions

When you were trapped in the pit
in ARMY OF DARKNESS how did you
get your shotgun

When you kissed “Ellen” did it
turn you gay

FOURTH DEVOTED FAN
How much wood could a woodchuck

BRUCE
Who cares absolutely not and

Gotta run boys I’m late for a
soiree

Bruce maneuvers around to his car a battered Ford Pinto
As he slides in and slams the door the fans continue to

assail him with inane questions one of them even getting
in front of the car Bruce

GUNS IT ANYWAY plowing right into the guy who shouts
his question even as he’s tumbling across the hood

DEVOTED FAN
Mr Campbell Mr Camp
(WOMP He’s hit)
-bellAHHHH

As Bruce ROARS OFF we can see his fans running after him
(or in the case of the one who’s been hit stumbling and
clutching his injured leg) shouting more questions

INT MUSSO AND FRANKS - NIGHT

Bruce enters the busy restaurant face sour as he looks
for someone As he passes the bar the BARTENDER shoots
him a knowing look

BRUCE
Gimme a bourbon with a loaded
revolver back

Bruce continues into the restaurant itself spotting
MILLS TODDNER sitting alone at a table talking on his
cell-phone and flipping through the trades As Bruce
walks up he points at the Variety

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hear I made the trades today

MILLS
Really

BRUCE
Yeah My career’s in the
obituaries

Mills closes his phone and rises laughing at Bruce’s
“joke” giving him a big Hollywood hug and kiss

MILLS
Give me some sugar baby

As Bruce disdainfully accepts the hug

MILLS (CONTD)
(re phone)
That was the studio They’re
crazy over the dailies from
Cavealien 2 Said you’ve never
been better

BRUCE
I speak English In their world
that makes me Meryl banana-sucking
Streep

The Bartender arrives at the table and puts a huge
tumbler of bourbon in front of Bruce

BARTENDER
Will that be cash Mr Campbell

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 17

BRUCE
No My agent Mr Toddner will be
picking this one up

Mills’ frown suggests he clearly wasn’t planning on
buying but what the hell As Bruce guzzles his drink

MILLS
Why not It’s special occasion

BRUCE
Yeah The night I finally fire
your polyester ass

MILLS
Brucie Why all the hostility

BRUCE
I’m just getting warmed up And
don’t give me that innocent look
I’ve just spent six days of my
life making a sequel to one of the
worst movies ever made

MILLS
You’ve made worse
(that didn’t help)
Come on The customer reviews on
Amazon were great

BRUCE
The ones I posted

Bruce polishes off his drink wincing at the burn as
Mills motions for him to sit

MILLS
Park it BC unload That’s why
I’m here

BRUCE

It’s just I feel like I’m
losing my muse

Mills blinks an “oh God not this again” expression

MILLS
Say what

BRUCE
The innocent child-like quality
all great artists tap to
“create”

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 18

While Bruce pontificates Mills wearily motions for
another drink spreading his fingers to indicate he’d
like a double

BRUCE (CONTD)
They say an actor’s life is like a
painting a work in progress but
how can I create my masterpiece
when my paint’s drying up my
canvas is cracked and my brushes
are coated in fake monster blood

Mills brings back his game face as Bruce finishes

MILLS
It’s Deborah isn’t it

BRUCE
No

MILLS
It’s been almost a year since your
divorce

BRUCE
I said no

MILLS
You need to put her out of your
mind

BRUCE
If I say “no” three times will the
Candyman come out

(slides back)
Screw this You were fired when I
walked in and you’re twice as
fired now

As Bruce slides back getting ready to leave
MILLS
Leave now you’ll never know what

I got you for your birthday

The moment of actual sentiment catches Bruce off guard

BRUCE
My birthday You actually
remembered

MILLS

How could I forget You’re my
numero uno client

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 19

BRUCE
If this is another Matthew Perry
movie

MILLS

BRUCE

Give me a hint

MILLS
I thought you were firing me

BRUCE
Goddamn it Mills

MILLS
Let’s just say it’s going to be
the best birthday you’ve ever had
(snapping fingers)
Garcon Bring Mr Campbell

all around Tonight we celebrate

OFF Bruce sorely tempted easily suckered by Mills’ offer
of a snazzy birthday present

EXT MUSSO AND FRANKS - NIGHT

Mills and Bruce exit together Bruce three-sheets drunk
and stumbling while Mills continues to console him

BRUCE
(slurring)
Happy birthday to me happy

Bruce grabs Mill’s face with both hands squeezing it

BRUCE (CONTD)

MILLS
(“I know you do”)
Uh ow ah ou

Bruce releases Mills as Mills’ Porsche Boxster comes up

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 20

MILLS (CONTD)
Enjoy what you’ve got Bruce You
know how many wannabe Oliviers
would quick-lime their
Grandmothers for a career like
yours

Sloppy drunk and emotional Bruce lunges at Mills again
trying to squeeze his face

BRUCE
Would ‘ou be my Grandmama

MILLS
No But thanks for the offer

Mills manages to duck him this time and duck into his
car As Mills pulls out Bruce motions to the valet who
trots off to get Bruce’s car

BRUCE

Maybe he’s right Hell I ama
lucky fella I’ve got my
health

(racking cough)
JE-sus my divorce is almost
final

(getting angry)
--lousy whore

(revving up)

--and I’ve got my fans my
loyal fans who hated my last
movie hated my last five

movies me and my wonderful
wonderful FANS

As if on unfortunate cue Bruce hears a “clop THUD clop
THUD” as the limping fan he ran down at the studio
hobbles toward him

DEVOTED FAN
Mr Campbell Mr Campbe

BRUCE
Lucky friggin’ ME

WUMP Bruce throws a punch into the limping fan’s gut
Stunned the fan drops to his knees holding out the
autographed photo he got earlier from Bruce as

BRUCE’S PINTO pulls up the Valet screeching it to a halt
in a haze of exhaust The Valet steps out holding out
his hand for a tip and Bruce plucks the photo from the
gasping fan’s hand and passes it to the Valet

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 21

BRUCE (CONTD)
Merry Christmas

As Bruce roars off swerving into the street the gasping
Devoted Fan grabs to get back his photo

DEVOTED FAN
Give it back That’s mine

The fan and the Valet get into a pitched fight over the
glossy as the Pinto roars off into the distance

Uniformed Officer KELBO behind the wheel 30ish

hear POLICE CALLS over the radio

COP’S VOICE (RADIO)

As Kelbo hangs up the microphone suddenly
A BIRD HITS THE WINDSHIELD OF HIS CAR

Startled Kelbo hits the brakes and goes into a sideways
skid stopping by the side of the road He’s in the
middle of nowhere surrounded by woods

KELBO
Damn

Kelbo steps out of the car to check the damage The
impact has spider-webbed the windshield and left spatters
of blood on the white hood Disgusted Kelbo starts
wiping up the blood on the hood But as he cleans a
patch suddenly

MORE BLOOD APPEARS Then blood drips on his hand With

dawning apprehension Kelbo realizes the blood is
dripping down from above He slowly turns looking up

cans Still drunk Bruce gets out grabbing a grubby
suitcase from the back of the car He stagger-walks to
the door walking over a mess of gathering mail mostly
magazines like HUSTLER JUGGS 40 D-CUPPER

INT BRUCE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Cradling the magazines and mail in his arms Bruce pushes
the door open and enters tossing the mail on a couch

We HEAR the tinkle-bell of a dog collar and little feet
rustling as Bruce’s arrival arouses his dog

BRUCE
Here boy Come’mere Sam’nRob

The little dog enters the front room stops at Bruce’s
feet and GROWLS MENACINGLY

BRUCE (CONTD)
Whatsamatter boy Whatsamatter
with poor widdle Sam’nRob

The little dog continues to SNARL until Bruce remembers
something He pulls a brown paper bag from his jacket
pocket and pulls out a pint of cheap bourbon He
unscrews the top and pours it into a doggie bowl

BRUCE (CONTD)
Thought I forgot didn’t you

As “Sammy” starts to drink greedily from the bowl Bruce
idly checks some of the “envelope” mail Virtually every
letter has red ink on it and says something about “FINAL
NOTICE” or “THIRD REMINDER” He tosses the mail and
plops down in front of his ancient

BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION replete with coat-hanger
rabbit ears Using a primitive remote he switches the
set on and gets a static ridden image of an
“Entertainment Tonight” type announcer on a studio set

QUIET Selfish mutt

DEBORAH
It’s your birthday isn’t it
Every year it’s the same old
“poor me” routine

BRUCE

without it “meaning” something

DEBORAH

a walking hangover stumbles toward the door

BRUCE
Keep your pants on fer Chrissakes

Bruce throws open the door and nobody’s there

Ho ho Very funny

He stands there a second bleary and blinking then
notices something glistening at his feet Curious he
bends down and reaches for a SHINY NEW QUARTER

INT TRUNK OF CAR - NIGHT

As an engine rumbles Bruce jammed in the trunk wakes
up Dazed he lifts his head and CRACKS it against the
trunk lid Cramped barely able to move he slowly
realizes where he is

BRUCE
What the hell --

He pushes against the trunk lid trying to force it open
No good Annoyed he starts to YELL

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hey HEY Lemme out of here

The car hits a hard BUMP jarring Bruce as JEFFS
MUFFLED VOICE calls back

JEFF (0S)

Jeff is behind the wheel driving down a dark highway

JEFF

Oh Well As long as you’re

They hit another bump slamming Bruce up against the
trunk lid

BRUCE
Oww NO
(kicking at lid)
Let me out of here you psycho

freak

JEFF
I can’t Not until we get to
town

(helpful)

I put some Twinkies and a couple
magazines in the side pocket And
there’s a flashlight next to the
spare

Disgruntled but not really knowing what else to do Bruce
finds the flashlight and switches it on Near his head
he finds a couple issues of FANGORIA and RUE MORGUE As
Bruce stares at the mags in disbelief

BRUCE
No no no

JEFF
I know you’re probably sore and
tired and suffering from a
concussion but is it true
you’re doing a sequel to
Cavealien

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 29

BRUCE

JEFF
That’s probably my favorite movie
of all time

BRUCE
Oh my God He’s a fan

BRUCE (CONTD)

GAWW For Gods sake could you

off his porch into the darkness His WIFE stands behind

him anxious

WIFE

HANK
I don’t know Thought I heard
something in the barn

Serious he PUMPS his shotgun

HANK (CONTD)

Then suddenly there are MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS The Wife
GASPS shocked

WIFE
Oh dear Lord

She hears frantic running then something SLAMS against
the door POUNDS AGAINST THE WOOD

HANK (0S)
Open the door Open the door
For Christ’s sake OPEN THE DOOR

Terrified the Wife throws open the door only to find
her husband Hank standing there LAUGHING It was a sick
practical joke

HANK (CONT’D)
Haw haw haw

WIFE
You bastard I can’t believe you

HANK

Told you to never open the do--

Suddenly a SAMURAI BLADE erupts through Hank’s chest He
looks down gasping in shock blood spilling from the
wound the eerie silhouette of

THE CHINESE DEMON visible behind him OFF this

EXT SAWVILLE - DAY

The “Welcome To Sawville” sign still dripping with
(dried and yucky) egg yolk A hand reaches in and
changes the population number “2649” into 2646 with a
quick stroke of paint

INT TRUNK OF CAR - DAY

Bruce is lying cramped and half asleep when the trunk
lid suddenly flies open and he’s doused in bright
sunshine Wincing in the light a sticky Twinkie wrapper
stuck to his cheek Bruce JUMPS UP and suddenly FREEZES

BRUCE
Uhhhh
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 31

EXT SAWVILLE - MAIN STREET - DAY

PULL BACK to reveal Jeff’s car surrounded by two dozen
Sawville townfolk all rural types who let out a semi-
rousing CHEER as Bruce staggers out of the trunk

TOWNSFOLK
Hip hip hooray Hip hip hooray

BRUCE
What th --

The bearded MAYOR of Sawville steps forward
authoritative offering his hand to a bewildered Bruce

MAYOR
Welcome to Sawville Mr Campbell

BRUCE
“Sawville”
(peels off Twinkie
wrapper )
Where the fuck is “Sawville”

Jeff wearing a CAVEALIEN tee-shirt rushes around from
the driver’s side of the car surprised by Bruce’s
outburst Trying to calm him

JEFF
Easy man That’s the Mayor

BRUCE
I don’t care if he’s the King of
Kiss-My-Ass-ia I just spent six
hours in a TRUNK I want some
answers chop chop

Bruce waits looking out across the stunneddull faces of
the Townsfolk momentarily locking eyes with

KELLY 30-ish and pretty It’s a “love at first sight”
moment for Bruce complete with a slow motion “hair
shake” from Kelly He attempts a suave gesture despite
the “bed head” hairdo from his trunk ride

BRUCE (CONTD)
Holy --

(recovering)
Don’t worry sweet-stuff When
I’m done with these yokels I’ve
got a pair of lips with your name
on ‘em

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 32

She holds Bruce’s look for a moment almost like she’s
going to respond then she shakes her head again this
time in utter disdain

KELLY
You’ve got to be kidding

As Kelly pulls away from the crowd Bruce snaps back
into “I’m pissed” mode

BRUCE
Well Don’t all talk at once

One of the Townfolk tries another desultory cheer

TOWN GUY
Hip hip
(no one is helping)
Uhh

BRUCE

Maybe you don’t get “moving
pichters” in this fart-hole so
let me explain something I’ma
“movie star” Tinseltown
Lights camera etc When Bruce
Campbell says frog production
assistants jump

(leaning into it)
I even know Sam Raimi

There’s a muffled awed “ooooh” from the crowd

BRUCE (CONTD)

So when you kidnapped me you

didn’t just commit a crime against

me this is a crime against art
(looks at watch)

In fact I was due on set three

hours ago You can bet they’1ll

pull out the stops to get me back

To amplify this point we suddenly CUT TO

INT SOUNDSTAGE (EXT WOODS) - DAY
The myopic Director peers through his coke bottle

glasses setting up what looks like the tenth scene of
the day his cameraman nearby

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 33

ON SET Petra her uniform unzipped to reveal
considerable cleavage is in the clutches of the
Cavealien creature which looks remarkably not-
frightening from this angle

DIRECTOR
Okay looks good
(squinting)
Wait a second What are those
bulges on his chest

DP
Breasts That’s Petra

DIRECTOR
(squints again)
Thought it was Bruce

DP
A-hole didn’t show up Bob from
the machine shop is going to play
him for the rest of the shoot

The DP hooks a thumb toward a guy who looks nothing
like Bruce but is wearing Bruce’s space uniform while
covering the bottom half of his face with a cape like
Dracula (This is a direct homage to PLAN NINE FROM
OUTER SPACE where the awful double for a dead Bela
Lugosi covered his face with a cape)

The Director considers a moment then shrugs

DIRECTOR
Oh Okay
(to Petra)
Action

EXT SAWVILLE STREET - DAY

CUT BACK to Bruce exactly where we left him before the
cutaway still checking his watch

BRUCE
So as much as I’d love to stick
around until the FBI rips you grit-
eaters a new one

JEFF
But your agent said you were
“between jobs”

Bruce shakes his head in disbelief

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 34

BRUCE
You called my agent

JEFF
He was very helpful

BRUCE
That couldn’t have been Toddner

Bruce stops Dawning realization washing over him

BRUCE (CONTD)
Wait a minute What else did he
say

JEFF
Just something about not booking
you on your birthday

BRUCE
Birthday Birthday Say

As this sinks in a light comes on for Bruce His
birthday He suddenly looks at the Mayor and Townfolk
through new eyes

BRUCE (CONTD)
Mills you magnificent bastard
When you said you had a
“surprise” in store

More blank looks They have no idea what Bruce is
talking about

MAYOR

Mr Campbell I realize this is
rather unorthodox but Jeffrey
tells us your skills extend beyond
the Thespian

(dramatic beat)
And the town of Sawville
desperately needs your help

Bruce sees the Mayor through new eyes assessing his
performance

BRUCE
That’s good You’re good
MAYOR
(perplexed)

Thank you

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 35

Bruce considers a moment rubbing his aching head then
makes a decision

BRUCE
Let’s say I decide to play along
What’s next

MAYOR
Well uhh we’ve arranged a
presentation at City Hall

Rejuvenated Bruce glances over the heads of the
Townsfolk and notices cute Kelly entering an official
looking building

BRUCE
(re Kelly)
Is that where Miss Make-My-Day is
headed
MAYOR

As a matter of fact
Bruce smiles definitely getting into the “ruse”

BRUCE
Lead the way gents

INT CITY HALL - DAY

The Mayor Jeff and the other Townfolk gather in the
town’s small “town hall” outfitted with benches and a
slide projector in the middle of the chairs As Bruce
enters he makes a point of looking for

KELLY She’s sitting between two FARMERS but Bruce
doesn’t care He pushes down the crowded row

FARMER FARMER 2
Ow my foot Aghh my corns

BRUCE
(to farmer by Kelly)
Yo Jimmy Dean You’re in my
seat

The Farmer scoots down and Bruce squeezes in next to
Kelly The slide projector is right behind Bruce’s
shoulder Kelly shoots Bruce a cold look but holds her
tongue

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 36

BRUCE (CONTD)
(whispering)
Youre probably can’t break
character but I gotta tell you
you guys really had me going

KELLY
What

BRUCE
For a second I thought I was ina
remake of “Deliverance” and
somebody was about to tell me to
go “soo-eeey”

As Kelly reacts poorly to the slur the oblivious Bruce
offers his hand

BRUCE (CONTD)
Sorry I should have introduced
myself I’m Bruce Bruce
Campbell

Kelly unenthusiastically shakes Bruce’s hand

KELLY
Kelly Graham

BRUCE
Graham Bet all the boys go
“crackers” over you

KELLY
(not amused)
Ha ha ha
BRUCE

Me I could have sworn your name
was Daisy

KELLY
Why

BRUCE
Because I have this crazy urge to
“plant” one on you

Aghast Kelly starts to get up

KELLY
I have to go

But as Kelly rises the Mayor and Jeff motion for her to
stay put They don’t want to rile Bruce back up

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 37

As she reluctantly sits back down more people enter and
take seats The Mayor goes to the front of the room
standing next to a projector screen

MAYOR
Mr Campbell if you’re ready

BRUCE
Knock yourself out Whiskers

As the lights dim Bruce lounges back elbows on the back
of his chair a cocky look like he loves being the
center of attention

MAYOR
As we all know Sawville was
mining country before the logging
industry moved in

FIRST SLIDE A shot of an old mine entrance

MAYOR (CONTD)
In the late 1860’s hundreds of
Chinese immigrants came to our
shores to help work the claims

SECOND SLIDE Photo of a modern Chinese Restaurant
While the slides continue Bruce continues his line of
patter with poor Kelly

BRUCE
Kelly’s an Irish name isn’t it
(bad Irish accent)
Maybe later you can show me your
“Lucky Charms”

As Kelly squirms at Bruce’s attempts to “charm” her

MAYOR
The largest mine was the Triple
T run with an iron fist by the
legendary Thomas T Tripletee

THIRD SLIDE A photo of a harsh looking man with a
handlebar moustache Dressed in 1860-style finery

MAYOR (CONTD)
At her height the Triple T
employed hundreds of Chinese
immigrant laborers They worked
long hours in harsh and primitive
conditions surviving on rice and
bean curd

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 38

FOURTH SLIDE A historical photo of overworked Chinese
laborers standing in front of a primitive mine They
look bedraggled and skinny Bruce nudges Kelly

BRUCE
You want primitive you should
have seen craft services on my
last picture Licorice sticks
were like tent stakes

Kelly glares at Bruce incredulous

MAYOR
Then disaster struck A cave-in
Over a hundred Chinese workers
were buried alive Sawville was
devastated

FOURTH SLIDE Photo of the front page of the local paper
“The Sawville Gazette” circa 1860 The big headline
reads CAVE IN CLOSES TRIPLE T Next headline FOREMAN
SUFFERS BROKEN LEG Next headline (smallest) CALL GOES
OUT SEND MORE CHINESE

MAYOR (CONTD)
Soon after rumors began to spread
of a curse

FIFTH SLIDE A colorful image of the “Guan-Di” warrior a
mythical Samurai with flowing robes glowing red eyes and
a deadly sword

MAYOR (CONTD)
Legend has it that a Chinese demon
was summoned to protect the
spirits of all those who died

SIXTH SLIDE A shadowy out of focus image of the Chinese
Demon barely visible but pretty damn creepy

MAYOR (CONTD)
An amateur photographer captured
this image almost fifty years ago
when the demon was last thought
active in fact this is the only
copy of that rare photo

BRUCE
(blowing it off)
Yeah yeah real scary
(to Kelly)
Look baby when this is over how
about you and me sharing a bottle
of Chateau La Partydown

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 39

KELLY
I barely know you

BRUCE
Couple glasses of Sawville’s
finest and we’ll be the best of
friends I may not be Fred
Flintstone but trust me I can
still make your “bed rock”

Kelly suddenly explodes

KELLY
That’s it You are without a
doubt the rudest crudest most
insincere jackass I’ve ever met

As she stands Bruce also rises his arm bumping the
slide projector and jamming the lens against the hot
bulb As the precious demon image MELTS AND BURNS

BRUCE
Crude
(loud to room)
What crawled up her crack and
died

As Kelly tries to get down the row the Mayor desperately
tries to salvage the situation

MAYOR
We need a champion Mr Campbell
A warrior who understands these
dark forces

Bruce glances over his shoulder looks over the group

BRUCE
Great Want me to pick somebody

MAYOR
Actually Jeff told us that you
had some experience with evil
spirits

BRUCE
Moi Gents you got me all wr

Suddenly there’s the hideous SCREECH of FINGERNAILS on a

blackboard followed by a wizened CACKLE from the back of
the room All eyes turn toward the rear of the hall and

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 40

WING a small elderly Chinese man with a wispy goatee
wearing traditional Chinese robes He has brought a
small portable chalkboard just to make the screech noise

WING
Be warned He who confronts the
Guan-Di confronts death itself

Bruce slips down the aisle and walks back to Wing

BRUCE
Hello second act escalation
(to Mayor)
What’s with the fortune cookie

MAYOR
His name is Wing The last living
descendant of the dead laborers

For punctuation Wing scratches his nails across the
blackboard again Bruce winces and grabs the blackboard
away from him tosses it aside

BRUCE
“Jaws” We get it

WING
The Guan-Di has been unleashed
from his resting place

As Wing says this he looks straight Jeff who winces
guiltily Bruce meanwhile misunderstands “Guan-Di” for
“Gandhi”

BRUCE
Always figured this “Gandhi” fella
for being some sorta pushover in a
diaper

WING
The Guan-Di is a great warrior
Protector of the dead savior of
the innocent and of bean curd

BRUCE
Bean curd

WING
It’s a Chinese thing

(intense)
The graves of the dead were
disturbed and the Guan-Di will not
rest until this sacrilege has been
avenged

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 41

BRUCE
And when exactly will that happen

WING
When every blood relative of the
one responsible lies rotting in
the Earth

Oddly Bruce brightens at that

BRUCE
Well hell There can’t be that
many
(looks across room)
Blood relatives raise your hands

Virtually every hand in the City Hall goes up

BRUCE (CONTD)
Remind me to lock my door tonight

WING
(points at Bruce)
He will continue to kill and with
each death his strength will
increase Anyone who tries to
interfere will die

A light bulb suddenly EXPLODES overhead sending a shower
of sparks down on the frightened crowd Everyone turns
including Bruce Then someone looks back toward Wing and
GASPS

TOWN GUY TOWN GUY 2
Wing’s gone He’s gone

Bruce turns and sure enough Wing has disappeared As
the Townsfolk murmur uneasily Bruce looks out the
window

EXT SAWVILLE STREET - DAY

Bruce sees Wing walking nonchalantly down the sidewalk
clutching a bowling ball bag

BRUCE
Uhh --
INT CITY HALL - DAY

Bruce is about to tell the people in the hall about his
“Wing spotting” when the Mayor SHOUTS over the voices

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 42

MAYOR
Mr Campbell the future of
Sawville rests in your hands

The place goes silent Waiting for Bruce’s response
Bruce gauges them then

BRUCE
Lemme get this straight One of
your boys goes Giambi on my skull
locks me in a trunk and drags me
to hayseed central and now you
expect me to lay my life on the
line against some supernatural
hell-spawn

The Mayor looks at the other townfolk shrugs

MAYOR
Ehh more or less

Bruce looks across the desperate Townies His face is
arrogant until he spots Kelly standing by the door
hesitating as she awaits his answer

BRUCE
Lucky for you I find myself at a
crossroads in my life Struggling
to find the artist the “hero”
that I know still lies deep inside
me

The faces go from desperate to blank But everyone
continues to listen

BRUCE (CONTD)
Maybe that’s why I’m here to
rekindle that spirit
(revving himself up)
It’s the ultimate acting
challenge “Method” times ten a
way to reclaim my dying muse

MAYOR
Will you help us Mr Campbell

Bruce sucks in his gut puffs out his chest and strikes a
heroic pose

BRUCE
Can
(pregnant pause)
And will

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 43

As CHEERS erupt from the grateful crowd and Bruce exults
in their “love”

INT JEFFS CAR - DAY

Bruce rides in the passenger seat as Jeff drives Bruce
is leaning back in the seat waving like a Rose Parade
Princess as they pass overjoyed pedestrians

BRUCE
So you’re telling me the whole
town’s in on this

JEFF
(puzzled)
Well yeah

BRUCE
Guess it’s like some crazy fund-
raiser huh Instead of a bake-
sale you turn your town into
Demonsville for a few weeks a

year
JEFF
No I mean
(distraught )

My friend Clayton was killed by
this thing I had to do
something

Bruce nods knowingly thinking Jeffs still trying to
stay in character

BRUCE
That’s cool Professional
courtesy No more questions
(looks out window)
So what’s next kid

JEFF
Town’s throwing a party for you
tonight Sort of a send off
before you head into battle
(tentative smile)
Something I’d like to show you
first

Jeff pulls off the road and turns up a driveway driving
past a house toward a TRAILER parked on a hill As they
approach Bruce’s jaw drops open The trailer is dead
ringer for his Victorville digs

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 44

BRUCE
You gotta be shittin’ me

INT JEFFS TRAILER —- DAY

The door pushes in and Jeff ushers the perplexed but
still game Bruce through the door As they enter the
lights are off and the front room is in shadow Jeff
reaches for the light switch and clicks it on and

BRUCE STOPS IN HIS TRACKS Jeffs trailer is a virtual
shrine to all things Bruce Campbell There are movie
posters scripts and 8 x 10 glossies DVDs videos and
laserdiscs scrapbooks of newspaper articles trade
ads Bruce’s books etc

BRUCE
Kid if your last name’s “Lector”
I’m outta here

Jeff shrugs self-conscious but still proud

JEFF
Guess I am kind of a fan

Stunned Bruce looks around the collection There’s a
demon mask from the first EVIL DEAD A bottle of bug goo
from ALIEN APOCALYPSE A shoulder patch from the
CAVEALIEN movie

BRUCE
“Kinda” Only thing missing is a
stool sample

Bruce notices the Chinese Amulet that Jeff stole from the
graveyard hanging from a Bruce action figure Bruce
grabs the amulet checking it out

BRUCE (CONTD)
This doesn’t ring a bell

Jeff grabs it back stuffing it in his pocket

JEFF
That’s personal

Oblivious Bruce keeps looking surprised to find a photo
of him with his ex-wife Deborah tucked in with the other
memorabilia Touched by the old photo which had been
taken in happier times Bruce takes it off the shelf

BRUCE
Where did you get this

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 45

JEFF
Www photos-of-bruce-campbell-with-
his-ex-wife-deborah dot com
(watching Bruce)
You miss her don’t you

Bruce stares at the photo

BRUCE
Guess I do But sometimes things
happen between people that you
just can’t take back

JEFF
Like the dog-sitters

Bruce does a double-take

BRUCE
How the hell --

JEFF
It was in Fangoria
(as Bruce recovers)
Look I know this was a huge
imposition Mr Campbell so
whatever you need just let me
know

Bruce can’t help it He’s starting to like this kid

BRUCE
First of all “Mr Campbell” makes
soup You can call me Bruce

Bruce sniffs his arm pits grimacing

BRUCE (CONTD)
And if you really wanna get on my
good side fetch me a bottle of
Jack a bar of soap then point me
toward the nearest motel with hot
water and a naked cheerleaders
channel

JEFF
(thinking)
Hmm Closest motel is the Pink
Lumberjack

Bruce tightens at that

BRUCE
Keep going

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 46

JEFF
Then there’s the Manflower on
Route 99 Ryan’s Rear-Entry on Old
Prescott Road and

BRUCE
Maybe I’1l1 just spruce up here

Jeff is thrilled A visit from his hero

JEFF
Really Wow Great I brought
some fresh clothes from your
trailer

BRUCE
That’s wonderful kid

Bruce is about to respond when he notices a shelf of hand-
labelled video tapes

BRUCE (CONTD)
Jesus God You actually have
every episode of Jack Of All
Trades

JEFF
Yeah Want to watch one

Bruce reluctantly tosses his jacket across the couch

BRUCE
I’m gonna regret this

OFF Jeffs hero-worshipping smile

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

The Chinese cemetery visible out front Wing the
Chinese Man moves through the old stones toward the
foreboding cave site

WING
(to “ancestors” )
They allowed you to die left it

to the few who survived to tend
your spirits
EXT CAVE - DAY

Wing goes up to the cave and sits at the entrance the
wind whistling eerily around him

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 47

WING
I pray to you Guan-Di for
vengeance I pray for you to
destroy them all
(with intensity)
Especially the demon-fighter
known as Campbell

INT JEFFS TRAILER —- DAY

Bruce steps out of the trailer’s bathroom dressed in
fresh clothes still toweling his hair dry Curious
Bruce holds out a small bottle with an “EVIL DEAD” logo
but Japanese lettering identifying the actual product

BRUCE
Ahh Nothing like a shower to
wash your blues away
(holding out bottle)
Where the heck did you find this
“Evil Dead” shampoo

JEFF
That’s drain cleaner

Bruce stops drying his head looking down as a big CLUMP
of hair falls from the towel

BRUCE
That would explain the burning
sensation

Gingerly Bruce tosses the towel aside catching the
worshipful look from Jeff

BRUCE (CONTD)
(off Jeffs look)
What

Jeff realizes he’s been staring and looks away a little
embarrassed

JEFF
It’s just you’re going up
against the Guan-Di tonight and
you’re not even scared

Bruce looks at Jeff assuming this is part of his
birthday present

BRUCE
Compared to Kandarian devils this
Guan-Di cat’s no biggie-mo

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 48

JEFF
Really

BRUCE
Look kid when you’re in the hero
business there are only two
things you need to know One
monsters are mostly pussies Two
repeat number one

JEFF
Wow

As Jeff reacts with awe Bruce slaps his belly “Im
hungry” style

BRUCE
Now think a hungry demon slayer
could score a few Slim-Jims then
catch a ride into town

EXT SAWVILLE STREET - DAY

Jeff pulls up to the curb in his pick-up and Bruce slides
out finishing his peanut butter and jelly sandwich

Jeff nods down the street toward a bar and grill
festooned with plastic flags and decorations

JEFF
I promised to pick a few things up
for the party Sure youll be all
right on your own

Bruce glances down the street of the one-horse town

BRUCE
If I get lost I’ll fire a flare

As Jeff nervously pulls away Bruce saunters down the
sidewalk cocky as he nods and waves at passerby playing
the role of “town hero” to the hilt Passing a

GROCERY STORE with a display of apples out front Bruce
grabs an apple and polishes it on his sleeve The
SHOPKEEPER steps out like he’s proud to have Bruce
pausing at his store Bruce takes a big juicy bite

BRUCE (CONTD)
Nice apple

Bruce raises an eyebrow “thanks pal” style and
continues down the sidewalk pausing in front of an

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 49

APPLIANCE STORE A display of ghetto blaster radios out
front As the APPLIANCE STORE OWNER watches Bruce hefts
one of the radios cranking up the sound

BRUCE (CONTD)
Nice radio

Assuming the radio is also “on the house” Bruce just
walks off with it leaving the speechless Appliance Store
Owner standing there not sure how to react A few
yards down Bruce walks past an

ELDERLY MAN who gives Bruce the sign of the cross Bruce
gives the guy a slap across the back

BRUCE (CONTD)
Nice improv

As Bruce continues on a gaggle of excited

SCHOOL CHILDREN suddenly rush up and surround him “hail
the conquering hero” style

KIDS
Mr Campbell Bruce Bruce

Bruce holds his arms out savoring the adulation as he
continues down the sidewalk

BRUCE
What’s up kids
FIRST KID
Are are you really going to

save us from the monster

BRUCE
That’s the idea son

There’s a collective OOOOH from the youngsters A SECOND
KID shows Bruce a crude crayola drawing of a cartoon
Bruce heroically stabbing a monster

SECOND KID
I drew this picture of you

BRUCE
Not bad junior not bad

A THIRD KID shows Bruce a crude crayola drawing of a

cartoon Bruce getting his head torn off by a monster
Blood spurting from his gaping neck wound

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 50

THIRD KID
So did I

Bruce double-takes shoving the drawing back at the kid

BRUCE
Get with the program Rembrandt

As the kids continue to crowd around him Bruce finally
arrives at

EXT GREENE’S BAR - DAY

A large banner across the front of the bar reads “HAIL
OUR CHAMPION BRUCE CAMBELL” Bruce stops under the
banner taking a second to study it

BRUCE
Memo to self buy agent a
dictionary

But before he can lament the poor spelling too long he’s
spotted by various TOWNFOLK who rush up and surround him
As Bruce exults in their adoration the Townfolk lift him
on their collective shoulders and carry him inside

CRACKING HIS HEAD on the door jamb As he’s pulled
inside rubbing his sore noggin

INT GREENE’S BAR - NIGHT

A small-town country dance-bar with a wooden floor
tables and a long bar across one wall A WOMAN wearing
an apron is behind the bar back to us as Bruce is
lowered to the floor by the crowd Bruce steps up to the
bar like a movie cowboy the Townfolk crowding around
him

TOWNFOLK
What do you want Bruce Open
bar It’s on the house

As the “waitress” bends over to grab a bottle Bruce
checks out her ass nudging the guy next to him

BRUCE
(re her butt)
Nothing like spending a night out
on Half Moon Bay ehh boys
(to Woman behind bar)
(MORE )

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 51

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hey baby how about a sloe
comfortable screw up against the
wall

As Bruce chortles at the old gag the Woman turns
revealing she’s KELLY Bruce chokes on his laughter as
she glowers at him

BRUCE (CONTD)
(gulp )
with a lime twist

Nonchalant Kelly picks up a bowl of pretzels offering
them to Bruce

KELLY
Pretzel

BRUCE
(reaching to bowl)
Don’t mind if I

Kelly suddenly THROWS the entire bowl into Bruce’s face
As Bruce recovers Kelly starts making Bruce’s drink

BRUCE (CONTD)
Look I know what you’re thinking
Movie-star like yours truly might
look down his schnoze at an every
day waitress but trust me doll-
face that’s not how the Bruce-man
operates

She’s almost done making the drink

KELLY
I own this place

BRUCE
(relieved)
On the other hand movie star like
me doing a plain-vanilla waitress
would be a definite step down

Kelly pick up the drink as if to pass it over then
laconically THROWS IT into Bruce’s face The Townfolk
GASP but Bruce just accepts it

KELLY

Want another

Bruce licks at the drink as it spills around his face

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 52

BRUCE
In a glass would be nice
(off her glare)
Is it me or did we get off on the
wrong foot

In the background Jeff enters carrying some boxes

KELLY
We never “got off” at all and if
there’s a God we never will
(glances toward Jeff)
Unfortunately my son seems to
think you’re some kind of hero

Bruce follows her eyes realizes she’s looking at Jeff

BRUCE
Ultra-fan belongs to you

Bruce takes Kelly’s hand throwing an exaggerated look at
her ring finger

BRUCE (CONTD)
I don’t see a wedding ring

KELLY
That’s because Jeff’s father left
us Right after Jeff was born

BRUCE
Must have been hard raising a boy
on your own
(big smile)

But in the “lemons into lemonade”
category sounds like there’s no
reason you and I can’t do a little
of the ol’ “trains and tunnels”

Kelly stares at Bruce aghast

KELLY
Maybe it’s all a big joke to you
but Jeffs talked the whole town
into thinking you’re going to save
us from this “Guan-Di”

BRUCE
Right And

KELLY

Far as I can tell youre totally
full of shit

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 53

Bruce is taken aback by that There’s a long pause as he
considers the insult then he breaks out laughing

BRUCE
I get it You’re the meet-cute

KELLY
The what

BRUCE
Mills thought of everything He’s
a genius

Chortling Bruce wanders across the bar leaving Kelly
baffled The Mayor comes over mindful of her attitude
still hoping and praying that Bruce can save them

MAYOR
Kelly I know you don’t much like
the stranger but we need someone
to go up against the demon

The Mayor looks over at Bruce almost as dubious as
Kelly

MAYOR (CONTD)
And right now in an absolutely
tragic turn of events he’s the
best we’ve got
Bruce looks back at Kelly and the Mayor and laughs even
harder OFF Kelly’s befuddlement
EXT SAWVILLE - SUNSET

The sun sets the dazzling orange glow growing dim

EXT CAVE - NIGHT

As the last rays of the sun set rocks begin to move in
front of the old cave as if something is stirring
inside Suddenly a

BLOOD-SOAKED SWORD

splits through the stones The Guan-Di emerging for
another night of vengeance
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 54

INT BAR - NIGHT

We HEAR a loud YEEEE-HAWWW revealing the festivities are
in full swing A band (The Smithereens) is playing full
volume while Townfolk drink and dance At the front of
this bacchanal in the seat of honor at the front of the
hall

BRUCE sits massive joints of beef and turkey in each
hand eating like King Henry the eighth

BRUCE
(spitting food)
More meat

As a SEXY WAITRESS hauls over another massive joint of
beef Bruce grabs her and plops her into his lap While
the Waitress GIGGLES at the attention

KELLY watches all this with a disgusted glare Suddenly
there’s an announcement from a frontier-outfitted

SQUARE DANCE CALLER

SQUARE DANCE CALLER
Ladies and gentlemen Grab your
partners

Enthusiastic townfolk “grab their partners” (male
female) and sashay out toward the center of the floor
With a smile Bruce tosses his leg 0’ whatever pushes
past the Waitress and makes a bee-line toward Kelly

BRUCE
Ma‘am may I have this dance

The Mayor shoots Kelly a look and she reluctantly comes
out around the bar taking Bruce’s arm Even though she
clearly doesn’t like being here there’s something in
Bruce’s infectious giddy enthusiasm that starts to get
to her As they get in formation with the others Bruce
whispers to her

BRUCE (CONTD)
You realize I have no idea what
I’m doing

KELLY
I’m sure that’s a first

BRUCE
Not really I haven’t known what
I’ve been doing for years

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 55

Bruce keeps watching her catching the hint of a smile

BRUCE (CONTD)
Wait a minute What was that

KELLY
Nothing

BRUCE
No no both sides of your mouth
curled at the edges There’s an
old Indian word for this
phenomena Kawatatcheeacha
Cherokee for “she who smiles at
one she is beginning to not hate”

Kelly rolls her eyes but not so mean this time With a
hint of actual pleasure

KELLY
Shut up and dance

A Square-Dance band takes position on the floor and the
room fills with music The Square Dance Caller barks out
orders to the dancers

SQUARE DANCE CALLER
Bow to your partner

As the dancers begins to move Kelly tries to help Bruce
navigate through the crowd

KELLY
Just follow my lead

SQUARE DANCE CALLER
Now swing your partner and dosi-
doe pass the axle then let go

While Kelly tries to actually keep up with the dance
moves Bruce is a loose-limbed marvel his legs swinging
around like some kind of string-puppet

SQUARE DANCE CALLER (CONT’D)
Allemande left with a right hand
star box the gnat and allemande
thar

Bruce’s a terrible dancer but the Townfolk are being
polite because of his mission and his enthusiasm
continues to be somewhat infectious So infectious that
he finally pulls away from Kelly twirls toward the
official Square Dance Caller and grabs his microphone

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 56

BRUCE
(calling dance)
Now swing your partner toward the
door then empty your pockets and
pretend you’re poor

The Townfolk are swirling around the dance floor but
these are “unusual” calls to say the least But in an
effort to keep Bruce happy they all swing their partners
toward the door then pull out their pockets sending
wallets keys and change spilling to the floor

BRUCE (CONTD)
(calling dance)
Allemande left then allemande
right then spoon in together all
“Brokeback” like

The Dancers look at one another then comply doing the
dance move then the women jam their butts into the male
dancer’s crotch

Taking advantage of a musical “bridge” Bruce breaks into
a crazy tangled-legged dance that ends with him doing
the splits in the middle of the dance floor Still
holding the microphone Bruce picks himself up and
advances on an astonished Kelly

BRUCE (CONTD)
(calling dance)
Now as this dance is coming to a
close see if she’ll kiss you
without holding her nose

With a swoop Bruce grabs Kelly and pulls her into a full
fledged bent-over backward smooch She flails a little
at first then the flailing stops and for a moment she
seems to be anticipating the kiss Then

KELLY
You wanna move that hand

Reveal Bruce’s hand completely inside and up the back of
Kelly’s shirt

BRUCE
Oops

Meanwhile all around Bruce and Kelly the dancers are
locked in similar steamy embraces but with Bruce
distracted and not making any more square dance call
they’re groaning as they try to hold their awkward
positions turning blue as they remain mouth-to-mouth

EXT SAWVILLE - NIGHT

Bruce and Kelly step outside the noisy bar and start down
the street At night the town is actually quite lovely
a throwback to an earlier more innocent time

BRUCE
Ahhh I could use a little fresh
air

Kelly is still a little wary of Bruce

KELLY
Me too
(eyes on him wary)
And just fresh air

They start down the sidewalk together the lights from
the businesses twinkling in the darkness

KELLY (CONTD)
(re town)
Even with everything that’s
happened God I love this place

BRUCE
I grew up in a town just like it
Little place in Michigan You
ever hear of it

KELLY
Michigan

BRUCE
“Little Place” About fifteen
miles North of Dearborn

KELLY
Sounds nice

BRUCE
People really cared about one
another out there “Values” meant
more than half-price cereal at the

supermarket

(remembering)
Made my first movie there when I
was still in High School

KELLY
Really

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 58

BRUCE
We were kids naive innocent
We wanted to make a film that
reflected our hopes and dreams

KELLY
What was it called

BRUCE
“Blade of the Skullripper” Guess
that’s when I got the acting bug

KELLY
You’ve come a long way since then

BRUCE

(sardonic)

Guess you haven’t seen any of my
recent movies

Kelly smiles at that

KELLY
Believe it or not Jeff’s shown me
a couple I don’t know about the
plots but you’re usually pretty
good in them

Bruce is taken by the compliment

BRUCE
You really mean that

KELLY
Wouldn’t say it if I didn’t

Bruce stops and turns to face Kelly A romantic moment
in the offing

BRUCE
You’re just full of surprises
Kelly Graham You’re going to
find this hard to believe but
I’ve always been shy Maybe
that’s why I come on so strong

KELLY
Hey I came on a little strong
myself

BRUCE
(moving in for kiss)
It’s never been easy for me
to

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 59

KELLY
Yes

BRUCE
express my true feelings

As Bruce is about to kiss her Kelly suddenly looks over
her shoulder annoyed

KELLY
You want to move that hand

PULL OUT to reveal Bruce’s hand clamped securely on
Kelly’s butt cheek He jerks it away

BRUCE
Sorry

KELLY
I’ll let it go this time

Kelly’s already forgiven him They’re closing for their
first KISS when there’s a HARUMMPH off camera Bruce and
Kelly both look over in surprise seeing

EVERYONE FROM THE DANCE in the street staring at them

MAYOR
Mr Campbell
(taps watch)
It’s time

Bruce looks at Kelly Back at the Mayor Desperate to
consummate the kiss

BRUCE
Five minutes

MAYOR
Mr Campbell

BRUCE

For the love of God I can smell
her Chap-Stick

But the Mayor’s expression says “nope” OFF this
moment

INT GUN STORE - NIGHT

The doors whip open and Bruce moves inside checking out
the walls of rifles shotguns pistols and other weapons

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 60

Zoom in on Bruce’s face hard and serious The bald
STOREKEEPER waits expectantly

BRUCE
All right small-town America
Show me what you’ve got

In a montage of image we see a tough man’s hands getting
ready for some monster killin’ action

Capable hands strap on a flak-jacket with multiple
pockets for weapons

Cinch up a sheath for a big-ass hunting knife
Fingers quickly punch shells into a shotgun

A hand SPINS a revolver old west style dropping it into
a leather holster

Hands strap on double shotgun holsters plunging double-
barrels into each holster

Finally the hands grab a Jason-esque HOCKEY MASK As the
hands prepare to put on the mask

PULL BACK to reveal the incredibly well-armedarmored man
is actually THE MAYOR

MAYOR
Okay I’m set

Continue to PULL BACK to reveal Bruce standing nearby
totally unarmed watching incredulously

BRUCE
Wonderful Anything left for me

Jeff reaches behind the counter and swings up a silver
plated CHAINSAW banging it down on the counter

JEFF
I had it made special just for
you A Briggs and Stratton two-
barrel with a half-inch claw

Bruce picks up the saw hefting it checking it out
It’s been customized with a Bruce Campbell signature on
the gleaming blade

BRUCE
Sweet
(tosses it aside)
And if I were going up against a
tree possibly even appropriate

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 61

Bruce starts pointing at guns grenades bear-traps and
other devices hanging on display in the gun store like a
guy pointing at the food pictures in a Chinese
restaurant

BRUCE (CONTD)
Gimme one of those two of those
a handful of those attaboy
just keep ‘em coming Cueball

The bald STOREKEEPER loads the weaponry up in Bruce’s
arms weighing him down with rifles shotguns and
bazookas Bruce staggers a moment under the weight then
suddenly just DUMPS everything

BRUCE (CONTD)
Who wants a piece of this

Jeff and several other Townfolk steps forward Casual
Bruce starts tossing them weapons He hurls a rifle at a
squinch-faced MAN smoking a PIPE

BRUCE (CONTD)
Here you go Popeye

He tosses a ‘45 Magnum pistol at a skinny looking
SCHOOLTEACHER TYPE

BRUCE (CONTD)
Schwarzenegger gets the “make my
day”

On a roll Bruce tosses three or four hand grenades to a
second MAN nonchalantly going for style points and
tossing the last one under his leg

BRUCE (CONTD)
Heads up Hup hup hup

As the Grenade Man strugglesjuggles to catch them the
Storekeeper is aghast

STOREKEEPER
Mr Campbell those are live
grenades

Bruce gives the Storekeeper a knowing wink

BRUCE
Pull the other one spit-shine
(rising)
The rest of you don’t be shy

Load up

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 62

As the other Townfolk gather around the pick up their
weapons including a severe looking “FARM WOMAN” who

samples several pieces then picks up one of the bear
traps

BRUCE (CONTD)
Sure you know how to handle that
sister

The Farm Woman pulls a carrot out of her pocket puts it
between the trap’s jaws and triggers the mechanism
Chopping the carrot off at the root

BRUCE (CONTD)
All right You’re taking point

As the Farmers continue to arm up Jeff comes up beside
Bruce

JEFF
Are you ready for this

BRUCE
Kid I made a movie in Bulgaria
I’m ready for anything

The Mayor and several other male TOWNFOLK nod knowingly
at the seemingly non-sequitur comment as Bruce moves to
the doorway of the store He frames himself heroically
in the doorway looking back at his peeps

BRUCE (CONTD)
Let’s rock

EXT SAWVILLE STREET - NIGHT

A convoy of cars and pick-ups tear through downtown
Sawville past the bar where

KELLY watches with worry Some of the armed-up Townfolk
are standing in the back of the pick-ups waving and
firing their guns in rowdy celebration of the battle to
come Suddenly

BRUCE’S TRUCK skids to a stop outside the bar dust
billowing up around it (even though it’s a paved
street what up with that) Bruce emerges from the
wafting dust practically in Kelly’s arms

BRUCE

Hey baby How about a kiss for
good luck

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 63

Apparently moved by the gesture Kelly looks Bruce in the
eye For an instant it looks like they’re going to
finally kiss then

KELLY
You wanna move that hand

PAN DOWN to reveal Bruce’s hand clamped on Kelly’s boob

BRUCE
Just checking

The “romantic” moment shattered Bruce backs toward his
truck jaunty as ever

BRUCE (CONTD)
Put yourself on simmer
sweetheart ‘Cause when I come
back I plan to stake a claim to
the prettiest green eyes I’ve ever
seen

(to the others)
Now let’s do this thing

As the pick-ups and cars tear out HOLD ON Kelly who
looks worried and concerned

KELLY
My eyes are brown

As the cars careen into the darkness

EXT STAGING AREA - NIGHT

A field outside some woods somewhere on the outskirts of
town The full moon offers some illumination along with
the fiery TORCHES being carried by several Townfolk
They’re also all equipped with small personal WALKIE
TALKIES As the move through the area the MAYOR spots
something on the ground

NOTE that the Mayor is still wearing his Friday The 13th
hockey mask and all the weaponryaccoutrements that he
gathered at the gun store

MAYOR
Hold it What do you make of
this

Bruce kneels authoritative picks up a handful of
gravel sifting it through his fingers

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 64

BRUCE
(thoughtful)
Looks like gravel

MAYOR
I mean these tracks

A set of well defined devil-hoof footprints are visible
IN the gravel

BRUCE
Id say weve found us a Guan-Di

Bruce rises as the townspeople gather ‘round

MAYOR
No surprise The killings have
all been in this general area
(rising somber)
We’re on it’s hunting ground now

BRUCE
(with gravitas)
It’s not hunting us Mayor We’re
hunting him

The Townfolk exchange dubious looks

MAYOR
No I think it’s still hunting us

Bruce can sense the “nervousness” of his team

BRUCE
Okay it’s liable to get ugly out
there So when things look bad
when it looks like you’re not
going to make it remember two
things One even if you don’t
have medical insurance emergency
rooms are mandated by Federal law
to treat severely injured
patients

That doesn’t exactly inspire confidence

GUY WITH TORCH
What’s number two

BRUCE
(pauses for effect)
None of that matters ‘cause Bruce
Campbell’s got your back

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 65

With that rousing thought galvanizing them the Townfolk
ROAR their approval and the whole posse takes off into
the woods Bruce and the Woman lugging the bear-trap
take the lead

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The Townfolk and Bruce have fanned out in the dark woods
Flickering torches and flashlights through the trees
Random walkie-talkie messages SQUAWK through the silence

WALKIE VOICE
This is Henderson I’m crossing
Haselton Road no sign of the
demon over

Jeff hangs close to Bruce as they stalk through the
underbrush their guns out and ready

BRUCE
It’s quiet Almost too

WALKIE VOICE
(super-loud)
Wait

Bruce JUMPS at the super-loud warning

BRUCE
Jesus

WALKIE VOICE
I think I heard something

Suddenly the weird ominous sound of the Guan-Di echoes
through the area Sort of like a cross between some
Chinese chant and the screech of an owl Bruce is
impressed glances toward Jeff

BRUCE
When this is over you gotta
introduce me to the guy who does
your foley

THROUGH THE WOODS

A dark figure the Guan-Di floats through the darkness
Moonlight glints off the demon’s sword and ritual
costume but it’s barely visible

WALKIE VOICE
Wait wait Oh God I think I
see it over

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 66

Bruce grabs his walkie-talkie

BRUCE
Good Now see if you can flank
him and ease him around to my
position over

WALKIE VOICE
He’s got a sword over

BRUCE
Right Just move him on over
and

WALKIE VOICE
It’s a big sucker

Bruce is getting annoyed with all the pointless “delays”

BRUCE
Point taken Now please lead El
Demonostro my way so I can
(makes “air quotes”
for a baffled Jeff)
-“open fire” and we can all get
back to town

WALKIE VOICE
Shit he saw me He’s turning
this way

BRUCE
Oh great

WALKIE VOICE
God oh shit oh AHHHHHHHH --

The Walkie Voice suddenly does DEAD Bruce stares at the
Walkie in his hand

BRUCE
Hello

He hits the “talk” button getting loud SQUAWKS
BRUCE (CONTD)
Testing testing Dammit are you

bringing me this “demon” or not

Nothing but static on the walkie-talkie Really annoyed
now Bruce stands up waving his arms impatiently

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 67

BRUCE (CONTD)
Okay everybody Cut cut
(annoyed)
I’m trying to stay in character
but radio-schmucko seems to lost a
couple pages of the script

Suddenly something CAREENS out of the darkness landing
at Bruce’s feet with a THUD It’s the bear-trap Womans

SEVERED HEAD steam-breath still puffing from her lips
Bruce looks down at the head still not quite
understanding what’s really going on Thinks it’s a make-
up effect

BRUCE (CONTD)
Breath’s a nice touch

Dead ahead several more TOWNFOLK suddenly rush out of
the woods straight toward Bruce SCREAMING in terror

BRUCE (CONTD)
What the -- Where are you
going

As one of the slower Townfolk tries to get away the
fiercesome figure of the Guan-Di suddenly looms over him
his sword LASHING OUT and splitting the man’s head in
two

SPLIT MAN
GAHHGHH

Jeff grabs at Bruce’s sleeve tugging at him

JEFF
Bruce Do something

As Bruce gapes in disbelief the Guan-Di emerges from the
shadows rising to it’s full eight foot height Sword
dripping blood it’s eyes blazing red Suddenly (and
improbably) there’s a flash of lightning and Bruce gets
his first full-on look at the terrifying demon

BRUCE
What the fuck is that

RUNNING TOWNIE
It’s the Guan-Di

ZOOM IN on Bruce’s astonished face as the full awful
reality hits him like a sledgehammer

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 68

BRUCE
You mean the son of a bitch is
REAL

RUNNING TOWNIE
Shoot it Shoot it

Bruce’s action hero derring-do suddenly vanishes
Terrified panicking Bruce struggles to whip up his
shotgun Shaking like Don Knotts he blindly

FIRES BLAM Hitting one of the fleeing Townspeople in
the shoulder

FLEEING TOWNIE
AGHHH My arm

Freaking out Bruce shoots wildly again BLAM

ANOTHER FLEEING TOWNIE
OWWWW my leg

BRUCE
Gangway

Terrified Bruce starts to run away from the approaching
demon firing blindly over his shoulder BOOM

YET ANOTHER FLEEING TOWNIE
AHHH my ear

TERRIFIED TOWNIE
Stop shooting stop shooting

As Bruce bolts Jeff can’t believe his eyes

JEFF
Bruce Where are you going

Bruce tosses his shotgun into the brush and starts to run
full tilt

BRUCE
The hell away from here

The Guan-Di continues advance raising his blood-soaked
sword a genuinely scary vision in the moonlit woods as

BRUCE picks up speed hurdling brush and fallen logs like
an Olympian eventually passing some of the scared
Townies who had a head start on him This includes the
Mayor still in his hockey mask

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 69

MAYOR
Campbell you coward You were
supposed to protect us

BRUCE

The Mayor doesn’t understand the comment until he SLAMS
face first into a low hanging branch As the Mayor flips
over onto his ass Bruce doesn’t even slow down running
back into the

EXT STAGING AREA - NIGHT

Breathing hard the SCREAMS of the Townspeople echoing
behind him Bruce frantically runs to the parked cars and
pick-ups trying to find one with the keys in the
ignition

BRUCE
No keys

INT CAR - NIGHT

Desperate Bruce throws open the door to a car and leans
under the dashboard ripping out the ignition wires He
breaks apart two of the wires and tries to spark the
engine to start but instead he electrocutes himself

BRUCE
All right coil wire to the
ignit
(as he gets a spark)
GAHHYGG

The force of the electric shock SLAMS Bruce’s head into
the underside of the dash

BRUCE (CONTD)
OwwWw

Dazed he falls forward on the exposed wires and gets
ZAPPED AGAIN

BRUCE (CONTD)
JEEZZ

Struggling to get away from the sparking wires Bruce
suddenly hears a gentle DING-A-LING of a bicycle bell
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 70

EXT STAGING AREA - NIGHT

Bruce pulls out of the car as LITTLE KID on a tiny “Sting-
Ray” type bike () rides through the scene Canvas
newspaper delivery bags on the back of his bike

LITTLE KID
Paper Mister

Bruce thinks a moment then has an idea

BRUCE
Yeah

As the Little Kid stops reaching for a newspaper Bruce
runs for him glancing around guiltily

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hey kid Your parents around

KID
Uhh --

BRUCE
Good

Desperate Bruce
THROWS THE KID OFF THE BIKE

then jumps on the banana seat churning his legs as fast
as he can Teetering barely keeping his balance Bruce
races away from the staging area

EXT SAWVILLE ROAD - NIGHT

Bruce races the small bike out onto the main road legs
still churning wildly when he’s BLINDED by on-rushing
headlights Bruce throws an arm up to protect his eyes
and

LOSE CONTROL OF THE BIKE sailing off the road and
crashing into a tree As he picks himself up from the
brush the car that almost hit him backs up to check on
him An OLD LADY driver rolls down her window

OLD LADY
Young man are you all right

Bruce runs for the car like a drowning man clawing for a
life preserver

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 71

BRUCE
You gotta get me out of here

The Old Lady points to the cat carrier resting on the
cars passenger seat The old tabby inside MEOWS
affectionately

OLD LADY
I’m sorry but there’s no room

Frantic Bruce suddenly grabs the Old Lady’s arm and
THROWS HER out of the truck

BRUCE
There is now

As the Old Lady hits the pavement Bruce jumps into the
trunk and PUNCHES IT As gravel spews from the tires
the Old Lady raises a feeble hand

OLD LADY
Wait My kitty-kitty

As if in response the cat carrier suddenly FLIES out the
passenger window accompanied by a loud MEOWWWWW

INT OLD LADY’S CAR - NIGHT

Desperate sweaty crazed Bruce hunkers over the
steering wheel and careens down the dark road driving
like a bat outta hell The light from the dashboard
gives his face an eerie “up-shadow” cast

BRUCE
Demons monsters what the
hell were they thinking Thing’s
on my ass now supernatural
bastard I gotta make tracks but
fast

EXT OLD LADY’S CAR - NIGHT
From Bruce’s POV as he hauls ass headlights stabbing the

Bruce CRANKS the wheel to avoid the woman

EXT SAWVILLE - NIGHT

The swerving careening headlights of Bruce’s stolen car
suddenly appear in the distance In the foreground a
couple of disinterested Townsies munching on snow-cones
take vague notice

DISINTERESTED TOWNIE
Wonder who that is

In the distance the headlights suddenly swerve

OFF THE ROAD There’s a distant SCREEECH of tires the
CRUNCH of metal then a muffled “plumphh” as FLAMES erupt
in the distance Then

A SINGLE FIGURE begins to runlimp down the street As
he gets closer we see it’s Bruce silhouetted by the
flames yelping every time he lands on his injured leg

BRUCE
(limping)
Son of a OWW gotta get OHH outta
here SHIT

Bruce runs up to the two Disinterested Townies and grabs
them by their jackets Bruce is crazyangry with fear

BRUCE (CONTD)
I need a car Pronto

DISINTERESTED TOWNIE
Aren’t you that demon-fighting
fella

That pulls Bruce up short As he looks around more
Sawville shopkeepers and residents emerge onto the
sidewalk Bruce begins to realize he’s making a “scene”

BRUCE

Yeah yeah that’s me

(thinks then)
I uhh I blew the thing to
Kingdom Come Yeah that’s it
I just came back for uhh
shovels To scrape him up And
trash bags It’s helluva mess out
there

Beside himself Bruce leaps out of the truck as the
sounds of CAR HORNS rise in the distance It’s the

CARAVAN of surviving monster fighters coming back into
town Hearing all the racket

KELLY comes out of her bar worried When she sees
Bruce they lock eyes for a moment

KELLY
Bruce Where’s Jeff

BRUCE
Jeff

KELLY

You just left him out there

BRUCE
No I mean kind of
(off her disdain)
Come on lady nobody told me this
monster was real

Down the street a GRAYHOUND BUS comes around a corner
getting ready to pull out of town

BRUCE (CONTD)
(desperate to Kelly)
Shoe’s untied

Kelly looks down Bruce takes the opportunity to SPRINT
FOR THE BUS just as

JEFF steps out of one of the approaching cars devastated
by Bruce’s betrayal

JEFF
Mom Where’s Bruce

More townfolk emerge from their cars some still bleeding
and seriously pissed off after Bruce’s shoot ‘em up

SHOT IN ARM GUY
Thespian bastard shot me in the
arm

Bruce running for the bus turns and runs backwards as
he tries to respond to the charges

BRUCE
Sorry

SHOT IN LEG GUY
He got me in the leg

As the crowd becomes a mob and begins to surge toward
Bruce he BOLTS for the Grayhound

BRUCE

Wait Wait For the luvva God
stop

He reaches the bus and slaps at the side until it grinds
to a stop Gasping Bruce runs for the door and jumps
inside the bus pulling out just as the mob reaches it

TOWNSFOLK
Get out of town Go back to
Hollywood You shot my Uncle

Gasping Bruce moves to the back of the bus and looks out
the rear window as the mob recedes throwing ROCKS
FAUCETS a round POKER TABLE and other handy items
against the glass But Bruce’s focus is on

KELLY AND JEFF standing together As they recede in the
distance their mutual looks of betrayal are like daggers
in Bruce’s heart As Bruce settles into his seat
utterly devastated a elbow-jointed piece of plumbing
pipe BANGING behind him

EXT BRUCE’S HOUSE - DAYBREAK

The bus stops at the driveway by Bruce’s trailer and he
gets off shoulders slumping a shell of a man As Bruce
nears the stoop of his trailer he spots a padded manila
envelope on the porch Dissolute Bruce grabs it and
heads inside

INT BRUCE’S HOUSE - DAY

Bruce walks into his trailer and spots SamNRob on his
blanket After his awful day Bruce is aching for a
little affection

BRUCE
Cute little Sam’nRob At least I

C’mere boy

The dog just stares at Bruce

BRUCE (CONTD)
Come on little guy Here boy
Here boy Come on fella Come
to Daddy That’s it Come on
Here boy here boy here boy
(suddenly mad)
Son of a bitch

Bruce HURLS the manila envelope at the dog getting a
loud BARK and SCREECH

Giving up on the mutt Bruce wanders to a cupboard
pulling out a box of generic “Fruit Loops” cereal He
fills a bowl with cereal then grabs a quart of milk from
the fridge and sloshes it on

BRUCE (CONTD)
Ill feel better after
breakfast it’s most important
meal of the day

He’s about to dig in when he notices the “message” light
blinking on his answering machine Heartbroken he
punches the “play” button

praying for good news

BRUCE
Of course I forgive you

just not cutting it

BRUCE
Huh

DEBORAH

My lawyer’s filed a motion to have

Fuming Bruce RIPS the answering machine cord out of the
wall then smashes the box on the floor

BRUCE
Heartless hell-spawn

Emotionally crushed Bruce spots the manila envelope near
Sam’Rob’s dog blanket He rips it open and pulls out

TWO SCRIPTS “Cavealien 3 and 4” As Bruce’s jaw falls
open he notices a little buck slip paper-clipped to the
first script “From The Desk Of Mills Toddner” Hand
written under that

“Pack your bags baby they’re back-to-back in Romania
Love ya Mills”

His life falling to pieces before his eyes Bruce
stumbles back tripping over a throw rug As he flails
he accidentally smacks the bowl of Fruit Loops

SENDING THEM FLYING As Bruce lands on his ass the
Fruit Loops and milk explode over him the cereal
sticking to him like bizarre sequins As Bruce lies
there dazed milk and cereal dripping off him

THE DOORBELL RINGS

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hold on just a minute

Still dripping Fruit Loops Bruce staggers to the door
He throws it open revealing

A HARD-EDGED STRIPPER (KASEY) IN A FLAG BIKINI waving

Who sent you

Kasey fumbles in her tiny purse finding a note

KASEY
“From your friend and agent Mills
Toddner Here’s some birthday

Bruce stares at Kasey in slack-jawed disbelief Fruit
Loops dangling from his hair and face

BRUCE
This was my surprise A woman

KASEY

Kasey reaches for her bikini bottoms like she’s going to
pull them down and show Bruce something “surprising”

You little BASTARD You’re the
one who dragged me into this
nightmare Now I suppose you’re
going to chew my ass for taking a

powder

JEFF
No I I just wanted to thank
you

Bruce looks at the phone like Jeff’s speaking Swahili

BRUCE
Thank me

JEFF
For teaching me the meaning of
“courage”

BRUCE

I ran like a cheap mascara

JEFF
That’s just it I was trying to
dodge my responsibilities by
dumping them on you You showed
me that I have to face this thing
on my own

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 79

Bruce can’t believe he’s being let off the hook Improvs
to suggest that was his plan all along

BRUCE
Well thought I’d help you shape
up I’m glad you’ve seen the
error of your ways yeah

JEFF

Truth is I’m the one who
unleashed the Guan-Di So it’s up
to me to kill it

The reality of Jeff’s plan hits Bruce’s addled brain

You’re gonna take on Toshiro

All I needed was a push Thank
you Mr Campbell

Distraught Bruce paces his living room He grabs the
bottle that Kacey brought and spins off the cap about to
drink himself to oblivion when he hesitates

BRUCE (CONTD)
Stupid kid he’s gonna get
himself killed
(about to drink)
What do I care I’ve got my own
problems

As Bruce stares at the bottle suddenly two tiny Bruce
figures appear on his shoulders One is the “Angel”
Bruce complete with simpering voice The other is the
“Devil” Bruce with a growling nasty voice

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 80

BRUCE (CONTD)
Who are you

ANGEL BRUCE
I’m your good nature Bruce
(simpering voice)
If Jeff goes up against the Guan-
Di alone he’ll be cut to ribbons
Youve got to help the lad

DEVIL BRUCE
(gruff voice)
Don’t listen to him Kid’s an
asshole Fuck him Nobody lives
forever

ANGEL BRUCE
(simpering voice)
How can you even think such a
thing This young man is our
biggest fan

As this conversation continues two more even TINIER
Bruce figures magically appear -- this time on the ANGEL
BRUCE’S tiny shoulders

ANGEL BRUCE’S ANGEL
(simpering voice)
You’re absolutely right Angel
Bruce Remind him that our fans
support us no matter what

ANGEL BRUCE’S DEVIL
(gruff voice)
What the hell are you talking
about If Campbell takes the dirt
nap we’re all toast

Surprisingly that last piece of logic hits home with
Angel Bruce

ANGEL BRUCE
(simpering voice)
Well he does have a point And
young Jeff did release the
fiend
(to big Bruce)
Maybe we should let him die

Bruce suddenly SCREAMS waving his arms dissipating the
multiple bickering devilangel figures

BRUCE
AHHHH

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 81

Bruce looks at the whisky bottle sorely tempted then
suddenly HURLS it across the room Resolve building in
his face

Kasey rises with a matter of fact sigh reaching for her
bikini bottoms

Kasey’s VW Bug putt-putts into town pulling over on main-
street Regardless of the weather Kasey’s still in her
sexy patriotic bikini As they both get out

Bruce starts down the sidewalk the same walk he took the
day before But this time the reaction is much
different He’s met with sneers and snarls Gingerly
he approaches the

GROCERY STORE display of apples out front Bruce starts
to reach for an apple like yesterday only to have the
Shopkeeper slam a BUTCHER KNIFE down inches from his
fingers

SHOPKEEPER
Apples arent for sale

Bruce backs off counting his fingers and continues down
the sidewalk pausing in front of the

APPLIANCE STORE A display of ghetto-blaster radios out
front Bruce offers a meek little wave to the Appliance
Store Owner who angrily punches the play button on one

of the radios

A chugging RAP SONG starts to play

our town from fear but all we saw
was his yellow rear BRUCE

CAMPBELL runs from a fight BRUCE

Bruce moves off from the blaring rap-song passing

AN ELDERLY MAN the one who gave him the sign of the
cross earlier

BRUCE
I just wanted to thank you for
your blessing kind sir

The Elderly Man suddenly HAWKS an enormous loogie into
Bruce’s face leaving strands of saliva dangling from
Bruce’s chin As Bruce tries to mop this off he comes
across the same group of

SCHOOL CHILDREN he had bumped into the day before
Seeing Bruce they rush up excitedly but instead of
“hail the conquering hero” they start kicking and
punching him

The First Kid KICKS HIM

coming out of his pants As the kids jeer a

THIRD KID the one who had drawn Bruce getting his head
cut off last time tentatively shows Bruce his new
drawing

THIRD KID
I still believe in you Mr
Campbell

The drawing shows Bruce standing on the neck of the dead
monster triumphant Bruce is touched

BRUCE
Gosh thanks

But before Bruce can get too mushy the other kids turn
on Third Kid and start pounding him ripping his drawing
to pieces

THIRD KID
OWW STOP Wahhhhhh

Bruce uses the distraction to ease away finally reaching
Kellys bar A CLOSED sign in the window Frustrated
Bruce is trying to figure his next move when he notices a
billow of smoke rising from behind the building He goes
around to the side where

KELLY is standing over a burn barrel grabbing papers and
posters from the back of her pick-up bed and jamming them
into the flames NOTE There’s a stocked gun rack
inside the pick-up

Kelly turns eyes narrowing when she sees Bruce

Kelly please I’m not a shallow
sex machine like most Hollywood

As Bruce struggles to reason with Kelly KACEY still in
her bikini marches up on them

KACEY
Hey Mister you owe me 50

Kelly is stunned Bruce is mortified

BRUCE
Just a second

KACEY
And we still need to have sex

As Bruce stammers Kacey pats the ground like that’s
where they should do it

KACEY (CONTD)
Right here would work

My God You really are a total
waste of skin

Torn between Kacey’s demands and Kelly’s disgust Bruce
turns to Kelly

BRUCE
Just wait

Frustrated Bruce runs back to Kacey and peels out 50

BRUCE (CONTD)
For Christ’s sake just take it
and go

He starts back toward Kelly then stops lowering his
voice to Kacey

BRUCE (CONTD)
(pig latin)
I’ll take a raincheck on the ex-
say a little ater-lay

As Kacey takes the money and leaves Bruce runs back to
Kelly as she shoves even more papers into the bin He’s
about to say something when he notices the “papers” all
consist of Bruce Campbell memorabilia

BRUCE (CONTD)
Kelly listen to me we don’t have
time to
(shocked)
Hey Those are my posters

KELLY
Jeff asked me to purge his
trailer It was my pleasure

She stuffs a MINDWARP poster into the flames

Kelly pulls an Ash “Army Of Darkness” action figure from
the bed of the pick-up and tosses it into the flames as
Bruce winces

BRUCE
A couple actually But the truth
is I haven’t been able to stop

thinking about you

KELLY
Oh please

She shakes her head derisively as Bruce takes a step
closer just inches away from her

BRUCE
I know it sounds crazy I mean we
barely know each other But I
think I think I’m in

KELLY
You wanna move that hand

PULL OUT and REVEAL Bruce’s hand jammed down the back of
Kelly’s pants Bruce pulls out his hand chagrined

BRUCE
Okay So maybe it’s over between
us At least let me help you
rescue Jeff

Kelly stops in the midst of jamming another poster into
the flames startled

KELLY
Jeff needs to be rescued

BRUCE
He called me this morning He’s
going after the Guan-Di

Bruce doll from the flames

INT KELLY’S BAR - NIGHT

A group of grumbling townfolk several sporting new
splints bandages on their faces crutches and other
medical evidence of Bruce shooting spree have gathered in
Kelly’s bar A rumble of discontent magnifies into open
rebellion when

BRUCE appears As if on cue the entire mob surges
forward and grabs Bruce pinning him against the wall
punching him

BRUCE
OWWW Wait OWW A boy’s life
OWW hangs in UMPH the balance

KELLY
Stop it Now

The angry ROAR subsides The crowd still holding Bruce
turns toward Kelly

KELLY (CONTD)
Let him talk

Bruce stares into their faces all seething with sheer
rage then

BRUCE
Look rural folk I know I let you
down and I’m sorry But the

callow movie star who came into
your lives yesterday is not the
man standing before you today

The Townfolk release Bruce and take a step back
tentatively giving Bruce a moment to redeem himself

BRUCE (CONTD)
That’s right It took the faith
of a kid like Jeff and the
decency of a good woman like Kelly
to help me see the light In the
last twenty four hours I’ve
learned a little something about
honor Respect

This time even Kelly is touched by Bruce’s sentiment

BRUCE (CONTD)
Man’s not much if he can’t own up
to his mistakes So I’m here to
apologize but more importantly
to makes this right

(heartfelt)

I’m not just asking you for a
second chance I’m begging you
for one

There’s a long moment of silence Bruce stands there a
moment then REVERSE THE ANGLE revealing that the room
is COMPLETELY EMPTY Everyone just left except Kelly

KELLY
You moved ‘em all right

Kelly hunched over the wheel steaming mad Bruce is
sitting beside her reeling from her verbal assault As
they tear down the road the last vestiges of sunlight
disappearing behind the trees

KELLY
Big ass movie-star Haven’t you
ever heard of a TELEPHONE No
YOU had to waste eight hours
DRIVING all the way back

BRUCE
Thought chick’s got off on the
whole mano a mano thing

KELLY
Mano a moron you mean

Bruce glances through the back cab window looking at the
Bruce Campbell memorabilia scattered in the truck bed
Posters cardboard standees and even scripts

BRUCE
Wait a minute

Light-bulb going off Bruce reaches through the window
into the back truck bed

KELLY
Don’t mess around My demolition
supplies are back there

Bruce looks again noticing a wooden crate that says
DYNAMITE

BRUCE
You keep a crate of dynamite in
your truck

KELLY
You don’t

Bruce doesn’t have an answer to that He fumbles a
little more pulling back with a handful of OLD SCRIPTS

KELLY (CONTD)
What are you doing with those

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 90

BRUCE
Listen sister maybe your idea of
a “plan” is to tap this Guan-Di on
the shoulder and “pretty-please”
him to death but seems to me
we’re gonna need more than that

KELLY
And you think you’re can find it
in one of your old scripts

BRUCE
Brilliant Hollywood writers spent
weeks on these stories

KELLY
Gimme a break

BRUCE
Rising action character arcs set
ups and pay offs

KELLY
I’ve seen better plots ina

Bruce sneers at the insult flipping open a script He
reads a second then

BRUCE
This could work -- where’s the

platform

KELLY

Miffed Bruce tosses that script out the window opens

another
BRUCE
You got any abandoned steel mills
with giant vats of molten metal
Kelly shakes her head “no” Bruce tosses that one tries

She points out the window at a sign nailed to a tree

“Jeffs this way”

They careen down the dirt road coming up on the

Bruce and Kelly pull up to the old cemetary a waft of
dust rolling over them as they park next to Jeff’s car
Kelly jumps out and looks in Jeffs vehicle scared when

she realizes he’s gone

Bruce YELPS as he turns around realizing he bumped into
JEFF who was standing right behind him

KELLY

As Kelly runs toward her son Bruce notices that Jeff’s
frozen in fear his eyes wide and staring

JEFF
(eyes fixed)
Hi Bruce

With trepidation Bruce follows Jeffs stare across the
graveyard to

THE FEARSOME GUAN-DI looming in the shadows sword
gleaming in the moonlit darkness As Kelly reaches Jeff
pulling him close in a hug she also sees the demonic
creature

Oh no

Rifle in hand Bruce steps in front of Kelly and Jeff

BRUCE
Stay behind me
(cocks rifle)
Things heat up Mr Winchester’s
gonna get mighty nervous

Suddenly the stand-off is broken when another figure
enters just in front of the Guan-Di It’s old WING the
bowling Chinese wise man

WING

Mr Campbell So you have
returned

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 93

BRUCE
That’s right Wing

WING
You think you can destroy Guan-Di
Destroy the protector of the dead
You’re a fool

BRUCE
Pot meet kettle pajama-man

WING
Don’t you see The demon is under
my command exacting my revenge
against those who have scorned

me he’s nothing more than an
empty-headed vessel doing my
bidding

The Guan-Di looks down at Wing with a cranky “huh
What’d you say” look

BRUCE
Uhh --

KELLY
Mr Wing He’s right behind you

Wing LAUGHS at Kelly’s concern pulling a small packet of
food from his Chinese robe

WING
I have nothing to fear from Guan-
Di for I have come with the
sacred bean curd

the graveyard PRO ECTE FO THOSE WH DIE BEWA E HOSE

While Wing is chuckling the Guan-Di is getting seriously
pissed He rises to his full height behind Wing eyes
blazing red with rage

BRUCE
Wait a sec Didn’t you say the
Guan-Di protects the dead --

ZOOM IN on Wing bean curd still spilling from his mouth
as he glances back and sees the Guan-Di’s demonic angry
eyes glowing over him Bean curd still spilling from his
mouth Wing suddenly realizes he’s hosed

WING
Good poin --

The Guan-Di suddenly LASHES OUT his silver blade lopping
off Wing’s head with one savage whack Bean curd goes
flying as the Guan-Di turns his demonic red eyes toward
Bruce and Kelly

KELLY
Bruce --

Bruce contemplates his next move snapping his fingers as
he gets an idea

BRUCE

Wait wait one minute

(remembering)
There was one other script I
did pass on it more like a
rewrite actually I saved the
thing Writer’s Guild screwed me
out of my credit

KELLY
Bruce what is it

Bruce suddenly raises his rifle and aims it NOT at the
Guan-Di but at the tree branches over the Guan-Di’s head

BRUCE
Sweet little number that goes
something like this --

Bruce FIRES The bullet hits a branch over the Guan-Di’s
head and splits it off sending it dropping straight
toward the demon The Guan-Di looks up as the branch
comes down --

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 95

MISSING HIM BY INCHES and crashing into a pile of LOGS by

sends them rolling out of the graveyard

Kelly and Jeff bolt but Bruce TRIPS over a fallen branch
and pancakes to the ground as the Guan-Di approaches

As they sprint off the Guan-Di reaches Bruce and PICKS
HIM UP BY THE SCRUFF OF HIS SHIRT

BRUCE (CONTD)
Ayiyaiyaiyai

Then the Guan-Di THROWS Bruce across the graveyard

Bruce SLAMS into one of the old markers and slides to the
ground groaning He’s struggling to pick himself up
when the Guan-Di suddenly looms over him grabbing him
and

HURLING BRUCE into Kelly’s pick-up Bruce’s ass crunches
in the windshield then he rolls off and hits the dirt
As Bruce tries to get up the Guan-Di’s shadow looms over
him again

BRUCE (CONTD)
Wait can’t we talk this
ouwWWW

The Guan-Di lifts Bruce to his feet so they’re looking at
each other eye to eye then the Guan-Di SLAMS his palm
into Bruce’s chest

ETHEREAL FIRE explodes from the contact as Bruce’s eyes
flutter stretching into an “oriental” configuration and
turning demonic red He’s been
POSSESSED by the Guan-Di

Desperate Kelly finds a heavy branch on the ground and
swings it like a BASEBALL BAT smashing it across the
back of Bruce’s head But the limb simply disintegrates
into dust as Bruce continues to choke Jeff

BRUCE
(possessed)
-took keeeeyyyy beaaannn
curd
KELLY

Oh God oh God oh God

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 97

Desperate getting an idea Kelly picks up on the
possessed Bruce’s last comment and BOLTS back toward the
graveyard

EXT CHINESE CEMETARY - NIGHT

Kelly races to Wing’s decapitated body Looking for
something she kneels by Wing’s corpse prying open his
dead hand

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Kelly runs back into the woods Jeff is faltering
gasping as possessed Bruce continues to choke him
Suddenly

KELLY rushes up to the demonic Bruce and STUFFS a handful
of bean-curd into his mouth

KELLY
Suck on that hell-demon Let him
go

Bean curd dribbling from his possessed lips Bruce
releases Jeff rears back and ROARS toward the Heavens
Spitting curd into the sky Then spent Bruce drops to
his knees head down gasping Not willing to take any
chances

KELLY finds another thick branch and raises it preparing
for a killing stroke She hesitates just for a moment
eyes filling with unexpected tears

KELLY (CONTD)
I I’m sorry

As she swings Bruce’s hand suddenly SNAPS UP and catches
her wrist mid-swing Bruce’s head is still down so for

an instant we don’t know if this is real or Memorex-Demon
Bruce until

HE LOOKS UP His eyes clear back to normal Slowly
shaking his head “no” as he stands savoring Kellys
relief

BRUCE
Youre sorry That bean-curd
tastes like
The heroic moment is muted when Jeff angry after being
choked KICKS BRUCE IN THE BALLS

Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 98

BRUCE (CONTD)

OOmphhhh
JEFF
Son of a bitch you tried to kill
me
BRUCE
(pained voice)
No it was the demon the one

without balls
Still in agony Bruce shows them the amulet

BRUCE (CONTD)
And this is what it’s after

KELLY
Costume jewelry

BRUCE

Not quite

(glaring at Jeff)
Genius here took it when he
unleashed Hari-Kari-Larry It’s a
sacred amulet the one that brings
peace to the Guan-Di and the souls
of the dead You know Just THE
WHOLE REASON WE’RE HERE

KELLY
Easy We can play the blame game
later Question is what do we do
now

Bruce pulls himself together Looks into the darkness

BRUCE
What else you got in that truck of
yours

EXT CAVE - NIGHT

OPEN TIGHT on a smiling heroic Bruce Campbell face
Slowly PULL BACK to reveal it’s actually a CARDBOARD
STANDEE from the CAVEALIEN movie featuring Bruce in his
uniform The box of DYNAMITE right behind it

The Standee is perched between some fallen rocks in the
mouth of the cave CONTINUE PULLING BACK to reveal Bruce
and Kelly rolling demolition wire out away from the
standee toward a
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 99

EXT DARK SPOT IN WOODS NEAR CAVE - NIGHT

Bruce and Kelly bring the wire back to Jeff waiting with
the dynamite plunger

BRUCE
Way I figure it this demon has a
serious hard-on for yours truly
When he spots my puss on his
doorstep he’s gonna go Pearl
Harbor and that’s when we drop
the mountain on his Jackie-Chan
ass

KELLY
Sounds risky

BRUCE
Yeah That’s our only standee
But right now it’s our only

In the distance they HEAR the demonic YOWL of the Guan-
Di Jeff hooking up the wires to an old-fashioned
“shove the handle down” detonator box shivers

JEFF
Jesus He’s coming back

As they finish their preparations Bruce looks Kelly and
Jeff in the eye

BRUCE
Look however this turns out I
just want you both to know

Kelly and Jeff both take a breath like they know the
sentiment that Bruce is going for

BRUCE (CONTD)
-that I’1l never forgive you for
dragging me out here

In the distance the Guan-Di moves out of the woods into
the moonlight His gleaming sword WET with blood As he
nears the cave entrance

BRUCE (CONTD)
Hold hold it wait until he’s
inside the cave

The Guan-Di sees the smiling Bruce standee in the cave
entrance and REARS BACK GROWLING With a samurai
change it runs at the standee blade high

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 100

BRUCE (CONTD)
He’s seen it Easy easy

But just as it seems it’s going to take the bait and go
into the cave entrance the Guan-Di STOPS Like it
senses something’s wrong

BRUCE (CONTD)
Shit

KELLY
What’s wrong

BRUCE
He’s not buying it Shit That’s
a great likeness too

JEFF
What are we going to do

Bruce collects himself shaking his head Can’t believe
he’s about to do this

BRUCE
Wait here I’m going in

KELLY
Bruce wait That’s suicide

BRUCE
Youre right

Bruce shoves his rifle into Kelly’s hands

BRUCE (CONTD)
You’d better do it

JEFF
Bruce the Guan-Di’s going to be
looking for you

BRUCE
Kay-rist
(takes gun back)
All right I’11 try to lure him
into the cave The second he does
inside you drop that plunger
Got me

Bruce is about to take off when

KELLY
Bruce Wait

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 101

She suddenly impulsively pulls Bruce into a tight
embrace They look into each other’s eyes then just as
they’re about to kiss

KELLY (CONTD)
You wanna move that hand

Bruce looks down surprised PULL BACK to reveal that
for once he’s NOT groping her

BRUCE
But I

Kelly smiles takes his hands and pulls them around her
in a passionate embrace Then they kiss passionate the
kind of kiss a girl gives a guy right before he heads off
to war As they finally break

KELLY
For luck

BRUCE
Another kiss like that I could
win the lottery
Bruce nods back to Jeff poised over the plunger then
BOLTS FOR THE CAVE ENTRANCE
EXT CAVE
The Guan-Di turns as it hears Bruce running toward him
BRUCE
All right Top Ramen let’s do
this
The Guan-Di raises his sword the steel glinting in the

moonlight as Bruce runs at him and TACKLES HIM STRAIGHT
BACK INTO THE CAVE

EXT DARK SPOT OUTSIDE CAVE - NIGHT

Jeff realizes it’s time to do the deed but he’s frozen
over the plunger

KELLY
Jeff
JEFF
Mom I I can’t
(anguished)
It it’s Bruce Campbell

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 102

KELLY

I know how much he means to you
how much he means to audiences the
world over but right now
youve got to ask yourself one
question

(beat)
What would Bruce Campbell do

Jeff thinks a moment then shrugs and SLAMS DOWN the
plunger

EXT CAVE - NIGHT

The cave entrance EXPLODES in a plume of fire and rock
As the explosion settles dust and smoke billowing an
eerie quiet falls across the scene

KELLY and JEFF slowly move toward the cave entrance

It’s completely sealed by fallen rock Horrified by what
theyve done Jeff and Kelly drop to their knees outside
the blast area

BRUCE’S SMILING FACE torn from the shattered standee
grins at them from the dusty boulders

JEFF
I I can’t believe he’s gone

Suddenly there’s a RATTLE of rock by the cave entrance
Kelly and Jeff turn fearing the worst stunned to see

BRUCE’S BLOODIED HAND clawing out of the rubble

KELLY JEFF
BRUCE

They rush over and throw away some of the rocks pulling
Bruce free He’s battered and bloodied but alive

BRUCE
Somebody get the license number of
that truck

As they pull Bruce out he makes a point of taking the
stolen amulet from his pocket and JAMMING it into the
rocks

BRUCE (CONTD)
And STAY there

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 103

Wobbly Bruce takes Kelly’s hand and with Jeff beside
them they begin to limp away from the cave It’s a
quiet moment the horror finally winding down

BRUCE (CONTD)
Just got one request Jeff

JEFF
Anything Bruce

BRUCE
Next time you release an ancient
Chinese demon call that Buffy
chick will ya

As they all share a movie-ending laugh

THE GUAN-DI BURSTS OUT OF THE ROCKS behind them In SLOW
MOTION Bruce Kelly and Jeff turn in horror as the
monster ROARS toward them sword high about to kill
them

BRUCE (CONTD)
CUT

(regular motion)
Cut cut cut cut CUT

All action stops The Guan-Di pulls up short puzzled
Kelly and Jeff take a step back watching as Bruce goes
out of character

BRUCE (CONTD)
This isn’t working

(re Kelly)
First of all could props swing a
little mouthie-washie for Ms
Romania 1992 Kissing this
broad’s like licking a cat’s ass

KELLY
(Romanian accent)
Up yours

PULL BACK to reveal we’re on an EXTERIOR MOVIE SET A
gaffer’s truck nearby reads ROMANIAN LIGHTING SERVICES
As the crew chatter in ROMANIAN the DIRECTOR OF
PHOTOGRAPHY (the same guy we saw shooting CAVEALIEN)
steps into frame

DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
What’s the problem BC

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 104

BRUCE

A blind man could see it The
audience is going to be totally
invested in my character by this
point We pull the ol’ “surprise
they all die” ending we’re gonna
lose ‘em

(slaps Fred on the

back)
People love me Fred They want
me to win

DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
But

BRUCE
Don’t argue with the muse

Bruce paces a moment snapping his fingers the picture
of “the creative process” Finally triumphant like
he’s hit on the solution

BRUCE (CONTD)
Pack up these potato eaters
We’re moving on

EXT COUNTRY HOME - DAY

A lovely little country home on a bright sunny day
After a moment

KELLY wearing a pretty summer dress steps out smiling
broadly as BRUCE comes down the walk jaunty and heroic

BRUCE
Sore eyes meet sight-for I
could use some serious feel-good
about now

KELLY
Step right up movie-star

As they sweep back in a romantic kiss Jeff now dressed
like a college preppy walks out on the porch smiling at
all the love on display As Bruce and Kelly break off
their kiss Jeff unfolds an official looking letter

JEFF
Guys guess what I was just
accepted to Yale

Bruce and Kelly both rush to Jeff pulling him close

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 105

BRUCE
Told you that C average wouldn’t
matter
(pulls them together)
Come on Group hug

As they hold one another savoring their new perfect
lives suddenly a shadow washes over them As they turn
eyes going wide in horror reveal

THE GUAN-DI standing over them raising his sword and
SCHWACK --

(THIS COULD BE THE END WITH THE FOLLOWING RUNNING
BETWEEN THE CREDITS)

INT EDITING ROOM - DAY

With the Guan-Di image frozen on a small screen Bruce
leans back from a flatbed enraptured with the conclusion
of his latest masterpiece He gives his weary editor a
nudge

BRUCE

Perfecto Fanboy’s will be
creaming their jeans over the
false ending

(cocky to editor)
Take three more seconds off
Kelly’s close-up no make it
five and hold on me Then give
me a fade and a dissolve pre-
lap that dialogue show me some
magic baby

Suddenly there’s another demonic RUMBLE The editing
room SHAKES Cocky Bruce suddenly looks nervous what
the hell is going on Suddenly the fierce Guan-Di demon
BURSTS INTO THE EDITING ROOM

and careens toward a SCREAMING BRUCE (just like the
ending of the first EVIL DEAD) CUT TO

INT SCREENING ROOM - DAY

ON SCREEN the violent editing room scene fades to black
Bruce leans back in a comfy chair in the plush screening

room puffing a stogie savoring the completion of his
latest epic

( )
Verheiden My Name Is Bruce 4206 106

BRUCE

Two trick endings Get my
publicist on the phone and tell
her to book my tickets to the
Saturn Awards ‘cause we’ve got a
winner

(hits intercom)
Okay Morrie roll it again

Bruce leans back savoring his smoke when suddenly we
hear another RUMBLE and Guan-Di suddenly LEAPS ACROSS
THE SCREENING ROOM and lunges at Bruce as he stands and
SCREAMS mimicking (again) the end of EVIL DEAD

FADE OUT
