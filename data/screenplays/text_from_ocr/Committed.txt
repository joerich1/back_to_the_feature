FADE IN
INT BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY

The sweet silence of slumber Suddenly an alarm clock ona
nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas

A well-manicured hand nails painted pink slaps the snooze
button and mutes Maria A few seconds reprieve

Then another clock stationed on a dresser broadcasts the
FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the William Tell Overture Toes
also painted pink swing out of bed and run to the dresser

LETTY MAYER late 20s and beautiful turns off the music
She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
arranged by color from white to beige to black Behind the
panties are rows of bras also organized by color Letty
pulls out some taupe undergarments checks them against her
nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties

Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored pink linen
suit She lays it on the bed Beast her cat jumps on the
bed and settles into the jacket Letty swoops the animal off
her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit

LETTY
Listen Beast What have I told
you about linen

The scolding is cut short by an Urge Overkill song that
SCREAMS OUT from another room On cue Letty heads down the
hall dressing as she goes She CLUCKS for Beast to follow

INT KITCHEN - SAME
Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS Urge Overkill
from the counter and checks the time against her watch

She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
arranged by type Seafood on the left chicken in the
middle then naturally beef Letty reaches for a can

LETTY
(looking at Beast)
Its liver saute

Letty considers the cat a moment and chooses another can
LETTY

Fine then chicken in gravy But
youre going to have to eat the
liver tomorrow

INT BATHROOM - SAME

Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
back her hair plastering an errant curl into place with hair
spray Yet another alarm clock sounds this time BLARING the
voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN

INT ENTRY HALL - SAME

Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock which is
mounted near the front door She bends down to kiss the cat
good-bye grabs a briefcase and leaves

EXT HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

A school bell BUZZES Grade-schoolers clutching lunch

pails scurry past Letty who stands outside an office door
She straightens her jacket takes a deep breath and starts to
turn the handle

Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA 7 the victim of a bloody
nose runs up to her bawling

CHANDRA
Miss Mayer Miss Mayer

Letty looks quickly at Chandra her watch the door

LETTY
(to Chandra)
Goodness this is a bad one Tip

your head back

She bends down and pushes back Chandras head Chandra off
balance places one very bloody hand on Lettys jacket lapel
staining it for all eternity
Letty grimacing takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
guides Chandra down the hall coaxing the child as she goes

LETTY
Come on Pinch it Chandra Pinch
it

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER 40s sits in uncomfortable silence with
BILL JOHANSEN the 50-something school Superintendent Also
present are MRS MONTES who is a School Board Member and
two other BOARD MEMBERS

Principal Gail glances at the clock Mrs Montes taps her
foot Johansen clears his throat

JOHANSEN
Well I have a full calendar today
and Im afraid

The door bursts open Letty stumbles into the room She
clutches her briefcase to her chest trying to cover her
blood-smeared lapel

LETTY
Mr Johansen hello Im so sorry
Im late Its very nice to meet
you

Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending
down to shake hands with Johansen and the others

PRINCIPAL GAIL
The Superintendent was just getting
ready to leave

LETTY
I do apologize A student had a
crisis

MRS MONTES
A crisis you say

LETTY
A bloody nose

There is no response Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase
and reveals the stain

LETTY
A bloody nose of epic proportions

Johansen smiles

JOHANSEN
OK Miss Mayer Ten minutes Wow
us
EXT PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust Chandra
sits on a bench clamping an ice pack to her nose JENNY a
limber 8-year-old hangs upside down from the jungle gym

Letty talks on her CELL PHONE She glances around to monitor
her wards eyes darting like a hawks toward the kickball
game

LETTY

(into the phone)
Yes hi Im calling for Paul
Lascher

(beat)

Letty dials again She sees two boys fighting over the ball
and moves in to break them up

LETTY
(to boys)
Not so rough guys
(into phone)
Mom Hi Youll never guess
whatIve got the best news
(beat)
No about work How about dinner

Brawl averted out of the corner of her eye Letty catches
Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar She
blows a series of ANGRY STACCATO NOTES on her whistle

LETTY
(to Jenny)
Youre in trouble young lady
(into the phone)
I know Mom But its the only
place I can call from
(beat)
Can you tell Ruth about dinner
(beat)
Pauls fine just fine

The class bell BUZZES

LETTY
Got to go Mom The monsters call

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant where the
patrons dare speak only in hushed tones Letty sits sipping
wine with her mother MRS MARTHA MAYER immaculate in a
cream suit young looking for her 50-odd years

Lettys sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty with flyaway hair
and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant oozing
happiness Letty discretely waves her over

RUTH
Sorry Im late

Letty pours her a glass of wine

MRS MAYER
Letty was just getting ready to
tell me her good news

RUTH
(to Letty)
Tell tell

MRS MAYER
(leaning toward Letty)
Letty dear is that a cat hair on
your blouse

Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse

LETTY

Ruth smiles at her but vacantly

MRS MAYER
How wonderful darling
(beat)
What does that mean for you

LETTY
Ill be running it three days a
week and

MRS MAYER

LETTY
Not now but maybe later if they

Ruth stares around the restaurant a shit-eating grin
plastered across her face

LETTY

(to Ruth)

RUTH

LETTY

RUTH

LETTY
Well my theory is that people can
really enjoy math but they lose
interest

Ruth cant hold it a moment longer without bursting
RUTH

(almost screaming)
Im getting married

Mrs Mayers eyes immediately fill with tears Ruth leaps up
and hugs her mother Other diners glance toward the table

One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with
her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth Other DINERS
follow suit Ruth grins back and starts to giggle

MRS MAYER

Mrs Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin

MRS MAYER

LETTY

Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty

RUTH
(to Letty)

Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse
She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and
her mother who peers at it with approval

MRS MAYER

MR ANDERSON
We thought it would be a good
project for her to set up her own
card-catalogue

Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her
hair

MRS ANDERSON
But what Im wondering is whether
we should also be spending more
time on her computer skills at

behind her classmates

MRS ANDERSON
And we trust your opinion
Chandras always talking about Miss

Everythings a morning blur Gradually items come into
focus -- the intercom for the nurse the door with a window
in it the three tissue boxes on the bedside table Its a

hospital all right Lettys vision is filled suddenly by
Michaels concerned face peering into hers
BACK TO SCENE

MICHAEL
I know youve had a rough night
but I have a few questions for you
Miss Mayer or Letitia

Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position

MICHAEL
Do you mind if I call you Letitia

LETTY
Letty

MICHAEL
(consulting his notes)
First off Letty can you tell me
where you are

LETTY
I answered these questions last
night

MICHAEL

I know this can be a real drag but
the attending physician on day
shift is required to do his own
prelim exam when a patient is
admitted during the night

LETTY
Hillview Psychiatric Hospital
MICHAEL

remember three items Im going to
ask you to repeat them in just a
few minutes They are chair cup

LETTY
Chair cup and ball

MICHAEL

Letty smiles a real smile this time

MICHAEL
Let me shift gears here a minute
(beat)
Do you ever hear voices that other
people dont hear or see things
they dont

LETTY
No

MICHAEL
What about patterns Do you find
yourself checking and re-checking
locks Or washing your hands over
and over again

Letty shakes her head no
MICHAEL
How about arranging your
possessions in a certain way

Letty pauses

MICHAEL
Yes Go right ahead

LETTY
Sometimes my food and my clothes
and my underwear

Michael leans closer

MICHAEL
How do you sort it--by lace and
cotton

LETTY
By color

MICHAEL
What if its got a pattern

LETTY
Is this really important Because
I dont think its a problem

MICHAEL

(looking at his notes)
How long has it been since youve
done something youve enjoyed
Letty

LETTY
(beat)
A while I guess

MICHAEL
That must be really difficult

Letty tears up Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm
MICHAEL

Hey itll be OK Well make sure
of that

Letty gives him an appreciative look

MICHAEL
For now why dont you just take it
easy while I confer with my
colleagues A nurse should be in

trauma like the kind youve
experienced
LETTY
I dont think you understand I
wont wait

DR EMLEE

Youll have to Your family agreed
to the conditions not to see you
when they admitted you to Hillview
Letitia

(beat)
We can talk about how that makes
you feel but we cant change the
rules

Letty sinks back on her pillows the wind knocked out of her

DR EMLEE
Dr Stones evaluation from last
night indicates youre experiencing
a great deal of anxiety probably
related to depression

LETTYS POV

Dr Emlee continues to talk His words become more and more
distant as the RINGING in Lettys head grows louder

DR EMLEE
We need to talk about starting you
on drug therapy Most depressive
personalities benefit from a drug
like Prozac or maybe Zoloft

I dont think we need to sacrifice
Letty to pep up a slow session

JOHN

DR EMLEE
Maybe youd like to share some of
your feelings about OCD or
depression with us Letty

Letty eyes the doctor Shes dangerously close to tears

LETTY
Do we have to talk about this

DR EMLEE
I think in the spirit of group
therapy its beneficial for each
of us to open ourselves up to the
others

Michael reaches his hand behind Dr Emlees head catching
Lettys eye in the process Michael pulls a silver dollar out
of Emlees ear

Letty looks but doesnt respond The other patients ignore
Michael Emlee is oblivious

DR EMLEE
You never know Letty how the
person sitting next to you may be
able to shed light on one of your
problems

Michael goes for a bigger trick Reaching again behind the
doctors head he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers
Letty almost against her will smiles

by revealing something thats

going on in his or her own life

DR EMLEE

I think its a problem that you
never told me about Michael I had
to hear it from another patient

LETTY
I couldnt really say anything
because of that fraternizing rule

DR EMLEE
Well Letty this does present a
liability issue for the hospital

LETTY
Im a grown woman Dr Emlee I
can take care of myself

DR EMLEE
What about Michael Do you know
the extent of his

LETTY
I know Michaels a schizophrenic
and Mrs Hallstroms manic-
depressive and John Lockyer has
episodes of psychosis and I heard
a rumor that you suffer from
delusions of grandeur

DR EMLEE
Go ahead and put the guard back up
Letty But you need to know what
youre dealing with

LETTY
I dont need a lecture I care
about Michael
DR EMLEE
Then thats even more reason to
listen Look schizophrenics tend
to withdraw from reality They
experience emotional disturbances
that result in personality changes

DR EMLEE (contd)

You could be lying next to Michael
in bed one night and he could have
a hallucination or a delusion It
might happen when youre driving
or

LETTY
Look I know hes almost through
with treatment here And hes on
medication

DR EMLEE

Drugs can help suppress symptoms
But lots of patients stop taking
them when theyre on their own
because the side effects are so
harsh

(beat)
And Michaels condition is often
worsened by periods of stress Hes
been in and out of

LETTY
I dont want to hear anymore

Id like you to promise you wont
carry on a relationship with

Michael Otherwise Ill consider
moving one of you to another ward
