Hub shakes his head continues to Garth

HUB
Heres a perfect example of what
Im talking about Since this boy
was suckling on his mommas teat
hes been given everything but
discipline Now his idea of courage
and manhood is to get together
with a bunch of punk friends and
ride around irritating folks too
good-natured to put a stop to it

Garth nods sadly The punks are flabbergasted
FRANKIE

Frankie pushes Hub against the bar Hubs eyes blaze

WALTERS IMAGINATION - A ROMANTIC BEACH

so in love It was perfect
Except for one thing

WALTER (0S)
The Sheik

WALTERS IMAGINATION - THE SHEIKS PALACE
The Sheik rants and curses at his followers

GARTH
Yes the Sheik He hated Hub for
stealing Jasmine and for scarring
his face He put a price on Hubs
head ten thousand pieces of gold
a fortune Assassins came from
thousands of miles away

WALTERS IMAGINATION - A BUSY MARKETPLACEBAZAAR

Hub and Jasmine shop Hub leans down to smell spices a
knife flies in and quivers just over his head

TWO ASSASSINS with swords leap at them Hub ducks SLUGS

COUGHS blinded Hub tosses him into a pile of melons

GARTH
Many dangerous men tried to kill
Hub and get the fortune

They turn a corner THREE ASSASSINS rush them The lovers
dart into a stall Hub yanks out a tent pole the awning
falls over the assassins traps them

BLUE Revision - 11302 63

Jasmine SIGHS gives Hub a Lets go home look

GARTH (Contd)
He and Jasmine had to be on guard
every minute of every day

As Hub and Jasmine exit the bazaar FIVE MOUNTED ASSASSINS
DRAW SWORDS The lovers run back into the crowd hotly
pursued by five horsemen as they duck and dart through
the maze of merchant stalls

Hub ducks a SIXTH MOUNTED ASSASSIN swings misses Hub
YANKS him off the horse leaps up pulls Jasmine up behind
him They GALLOP away

WALTER

WALTER
So how come all those assassins
stopped coming All we get here
now are salesman

GARTH
Hub was furious at the constant
danger to Jasmine he knew the
Sheik would never stop There was
only one thing to do So one day
an assassin led Hub bound in
chains into the Sheiks fortress
to claim the ten thousand pieces
of gold

WALTER
WHAT

WALTERS IMAGINATION - SHEIKS PALACE

NIGHT Two riders on horseback approach the Sheiks
fortress a masked Assassin leads Hub covered with chains

Inside the Sheiks GUARDS surround a face-covered Assassin
leading the bound Hub before the evil Sheik

GARTH (0S)

The Assassin was given bags and
bags full of gold more than most
men could carry as the cruel Sheik
ordered that Hub be taken down

into the Sheiks notorious Dungeon
of One Thousand Three Hundred and
Eighty-Seven Tortures

WHITE Revision —- 82502

WALTER

WALTER (0S)
What kind of greedy no-good scum
would turn in Uncle Hub for money

GARTH
Well I would

Walter GASPS

WALTERS IMAGINATION - THE TORTURE CHAMBER

As the Assassin juggles his heavy burden of gold his
facecloth slips just enough to reveal its Garth

WALTER (0S)
A ha It was a trick

GUARDS lead the helpless chained Hub into a nightmarish
torture chamber Terrifying HOODED TORTURERS await

GARTH (0S)
In the dungeon I whipped out my
sword and singlehandedly killed
everyone and freed Hub without
dropping a single gold coin

Garth whips out a sword easily defeats the bad guys and
frees a grateful humble Hub

WALTER (0S)
Wait a minute Wait a minute

GARTH WALTER
Walter looks very skeptical

WALTER
You killed all the bad guys You
saved Uncle Hub And all that
time you were carrying hundreds of
pounds of gold

GARTH
You dont believe I killed all
those men and saved Hub

Walter shakes his head nope he doesnt Garth SIGHS

GARTH (Contd)
Well Maybe Hub helped a little

WHITE Revision —- 82502 65

WALTERS IMAGINATION - THE TORTURE CHAMBER

Hub throws off his chains and fights the Sheiks men
Garth fumbles for his pistol trying not to drop the gold

GARTH (0S)
We were greatly outnumbered We
fought incredible odds

Garth tries to juggle gold and aim but Hub is faster and
dispatches Garths target first Garth scowls as Hub
defeats the bad guys before Garth can fire a single shot

GARTH (Contd)
Then we split up we each knew
what we had to do

At the doorway Hub heroically salutes Garth runs swiftly
away Garth hobbles out with his heavy burden of gold

WALTERS IMAGINATION - THE SHEIKS BED CHAMBER

GARTH
High in his opulent bed chamber
the Sheik slept Until he awoke
with Hubs sword at his throat

Hub stands atop the bed his blade pins the Sheik

GARTH (Contd)
Terrified the Sheik knew his life
was over that Hub would certainly
kill him Hub smiled then
lowered his blade He threw the
Sheik a sword honorably offering
his lifelong enemy a fair fight
Defend yourself Hub cried

The evil Sheik grins The fight begins CLANG-CLANG

And almost instantly faster than the eye can follow Hub
sends the Sheiks sword flying and pins the Sheik once
again against a pillar his blade to the Sheiks throat

GARTH (Contd)
It was over in a second Hub had
humbled him The Sheik knew he
was surely now a dead man with no
right to even beg for mercy

As Hub smiles and raises his blade high the Sheik falls
to the floor WHIMPERING closing his eyes And nothing
happens The Sheik looks up Hub stands in a window

PINK Revision - 11302 66

GARTH (Contd)
Hub told him Twice I held your
life in my hands Twice I gave
it back to you Next time your
life is mine

Hub leaps out into darkness The Sheik runs up looks
out far far below Hub and Garth GALLOP away into the
dark desert night

GARTH (Contd)
From that moment on the
assassination attempts stopped
Some say its because the Sheik
knew that next time Hub would
surely return and kill him as he
had promised

The Sheik feels his tender but still-intact throat and
stares after the vanished horsemen

GARTH (Contd)
Others say that since Hub had twice
spared the Sheiks life the Sheik
felt it was a point of honor to
allow his enemy to live

WALTER 107
Walter smiles blissfully Either way sounds right

GARTH
Personally I think the Sheik just
got too darn busy once they
discovered oil in his kingdom and
he became one of the five richest
men in the world

WALTERS IMAGINATION - THE SHEIK AND HIS GOLD 108

126 126

HUB (Contd)

Theres a long speech I give to
young men Sounds like you need
to hear a piece of it

(pause)
Some times the things that may or
may not be true are the things a
man needs to believe in the most
That people are basically good
That honor virtue and courage
mean everything that money and
power mean nothing That good
always triumphs over evil That
true love never dies

Walters eyes are wet Perhaps so are Hubs

HUB (Contd)
Doesnt matter if theyre true or
not A man should believe in those
things anyway Because they are

A sketch a childs lettered sign Africa points to a
cornfield where a whimsical lion sticks out her head

The lion and her companion a small boy in a pith helmet
explore an exotic African jungle cornfield The strip is
entitled Walter and Jasmine

TELEPHONE (Contd)
Its a blessing they didnt suffer

Night by a cornfield and lake is a familiar ramshackle
house a light on at the top of its leaning tower

TELEPHONE (Contd)
And a blessing too in a way that
they went together
A hand freezes over a drawing the boy addresses his
troops that include a pack of dogs chickens and a
surly pig The lion looks skeptical
TELEPHONE (Contd)
I found their will I11 give it
to you when you get here

SHERIFF
Best I can figure they were trying
to fly through the barn upside
down

Walt shakes his head a LAUGH bursts out is cut off

WALT
I always knew that airplane would
get them

SHERIFF

We had a bunch of reporters out
here earlier Even CNN I guess
anytime a biplane from the first
World War crashes doing acrobatics
flown by two ninety year-old men
with no pilots licenses well

Both try to keep straight faces finally both grin

SHERIFF (Contd)
Here I found their will

A single piece of paper Walt reads the scrawls

WALT
The kid gets it all Just plant
us in the damn garden with the
stupid lion

Walts eyes become wet He looks out at the garden and
the lake beyond Wind rustles stalks of corn

WALT (Contd)
These last few months my Uncle
Hubs been sick with pneumonia
From sleepwalking More and more
lately wed find him out there in
the middle of the night staring
out over the water

The Sheriff looks at the plane with new understanding
SHERIFF
Well They had a good long run

WHITE Revision - 82502 97

By now perhaps two dozen people stand among the
vegetables All wait look at Walt expectantly

WALT (Contd)
Oh Well In her life my
mother made a lot of mistakes
But once by sheer accident she
did do something right she dumped
me off one summer with two crazy
old men And there in the most
unlikely of places I found a home
My home

The wind blows softly rustles the corn stalks

WALT (Contd)
They had no idea of how to deal
with a troubled little kid So
they told me stories Amazing
unbelievable stories Stories
about harems sheiks and princesses
valiant men and evil villains
About courage Honor They knew
those stories were exactly what a
terrified young boy needed to hear

Walt smiles wryly shakes his head

WALT (Contd)
Even though we cynical adults know
such tall tales cant possibly be
true I believed them In a way
I still believe them Because as
my Uncle Hub taught me just because
something isnt true thats no
reason you shouldnt believe in
it Thats what fathers do for
sons teach them the things that
despite everything are worth
believing in

Some folks dont understand But others do

WALT (Contd)
It was the proudest day of my life
when I turned eighteen and Hub
gave me his full unabridged What
Every Boy Needs to Know About Being
a Man speech

TITTERS smiles Frankie and the hoods nod knowingly
WALT (Contd)
And one of these days Ill give

that same speech to my sons

LAUGHS And its over All start to leave But then

Everyone looks puzzled Big doors SLAM DOWN SOLDIERS on
horseback leap out riding beautiful Arabian stallions
Foreign soldiers wearing kepis and kerchiefs desert
uniforms Foreign Legion uniforms

WALTS BOYS
Its The Legion

The Legion forms up into a mounted Honor Guard Walt
cant believe his eyes Nor can anyone

Then they see another vehicle drive up a long long
limo pulls up and parks its doors open a dozen ARAB
WOMEN wearing veils emerge in a dense pack surrounding
someone of obvious importance The pack approaches

Walts boys eyes shine They watch the Legion on
horseback stallions prancing in glorious precision

And then at the gardens edge the pack of women parts
revealing an old old man in a wheelchair an ancient
SHEIK who wears an eyepatch and has a long scar running
down one side of his once-handsome but cruel face

WALTS BOYS (Contd)
Yikes

Walt is startled his sons jump behind him and peer out
The old sheik glares at the coffins with incredible fury
The women start WAILING mournfully the old sheik glares
at them then shakes his fist at the two coffins

Old enemies die hard

PINK Revision - 11302

The amazed locals watch as the mounted Honor Guard snaps
to attention

With a stunned realization the adult Walt is now certain
of what young Walter finally truly believed
