Final Screening Script

INT MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT

A familiar beam of light shines down The beam of light
descends onto a stage Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
plains The wind blows back his golden mane

PRINCE CHARMING
Onward Chauncey to the highest
room of the tallest tower Where
my princess awaits rescue from her
handsome Prince Charming

Lightning cracks Thunder booms Charming straddles a

wooden hobby horse and gallops in place A stage hand uses a
bellow to blow air into Prince Charmings face Another
stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background
n the orchestra a man uses coconuts to create the sound
effects of a galloping horse Two more stage hands back
stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
lightning A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
of a cheaply painted backdrop

fq

The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
audience

GINGERBREAD MAN
This is worse than Love Letters I
hate dinner theatre

PINOCCHIO
Me too

Pinocchios nose grows as he is caught in the lie

Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower
PRINCE CHARMING
Whoa there Chauncey

He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground He
strikes a dramatic pose

A Princess leans from a tower window

ACTRESS
Hark The brave Prince Charming
approach-ith

Prince Charming puffs his chest out
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 2

PRINCE CHARMING
Fear not fair maiden I shall slay
the monster that guards you and
take my place as rightful King

An old couple at a table look confused

OLD LADY
(to old man)
What did she say

Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
him

A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage

OGRE
Grrrrrrr

The crowd erupts into applause The Fairytale Creatures
cheer

FAIRYTALE CREATURES
(CHEERING)
Woooo hoooo

GINGERBREAD MAN
Yea Shrek

At first Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
Shrek-like beast He pulls his sword and confronts the

monster

PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare foul beast to enter into a
world of pain with which you are
not familiar

He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake

WAITER
(SINGING)
Happy Birthday to thee

PRINCE CHARMING
Do you mind

Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
stage It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade

GINGERBREAD MAN
Do you mind Bo-ring
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 3

The audience laughs Prince Charming glares at them and then
tries to recover He points his sword at the monster again
The tower facade starts to topple

PRINCE CHARMING
(CLEARS THROAT)
Prepare foul beast-

Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
falling He cringes

The scenery slams against the stage but Prince Charming is
unharmed perfectly framed in the princesses window The
crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming He shakes
his mangled sword at the audience

PRINCE CHARMING
(shaking his sword again)
Someday youll be sorry

HECKLER
(OS)
We already are

They laugh again Prince Charming throws down his sword
picks up his hobby horse and exits

OGRE
Grrrrrrr

The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage

to a door The door has a star with his name written on it
He opens it

EXT MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs His
shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater

Horses whinny as a carriage passes by The castle of Far Far
Away can be seen on the hill in the background Prince
Charming breaks down and cries

He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
to the vanity Dont stop believing Mommys Little Angel
is written on the picture

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 4

PRINCE CHARMING
(HEAVY SOBS)
Oh mommy

He weeps again and then looks back at the picture A
determined change grows across his face

PRINCE CHARMING
Oh youre right I cant let this
happen I cant

Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill His
expression hardens He stands and faces the castle He
holds his chin up high

PRINCE CHARMING
I am the rightful King of Far Far
Away and I promise you this mother
I will restore dignity to my
throne

A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face
He peels it off and looks at the headline His eyes tense
and narrow
PRINCE CHARMING (CONTD)
And this time no one will stand in
my way

In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
crowd

Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists

in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
with an apple in my mouth

Artie chuckles at this

ARTIE
Okay I guess thats pretty

Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire

SHREK
You know it may be hard to believe
what with my obvious charm and good
looks but people used to think
that I was a monster And fora
long time I believed them

Artie looks up at Shrek
SHREK (CONTD)
But after awhile you learn to
ignore the names that people call
you and you just trust who you are

Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment

ARTIE
You know youre okay Shrek

He tosses the stick into the fire

ARTIE
