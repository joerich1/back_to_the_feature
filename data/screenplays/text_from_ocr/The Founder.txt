INT ED’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen of a drive-in restaurant outside St Louis It’s
1954 Traveling salesman RAY KROC stands before a sample
MIXING MACHINE making his pitch to the OWNER

RAY KROC

Now I know what you’re thinking
“What the heck do I need a five-
spindle for I barely sell enough
shakes to justify my single
spindle” Right Wrong

(BEAT)
Mr Paulsen are you familiar with
the notion of the chicken and the
egg I mention it because I believe
it’s applicable here Do you not
need a Multimixer because you’re
not selling enough milk shakes Or
are you not selling enough milk
shakes because you don’t have a
Multimixer I firmly believe it’s
the latter You see your
customers they know that if they
order a shake from your
establishment it’s going to be a
terrific wait They’ve ordered one
before and by golly they’re not
gonna make that mistake again But
if you had say a Prince Castle-
brand five-spindle Multimixer with
patented direct-drive electric
motor you could greatly increase
your ability to produce delicious
frosty milk shakes fast And before
long mark my words dollars to
donuts you’d be selling more of
those suckers than you can shake a
stick at Increase supply demand
will follow Chicken and the egg
You follow my logic Of course you
do You’re a bright forward-
thinking fella who knows a good
idea when he hears it

(BEAT)
So whaddaya say

ON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully

OWNER
Nah
(BEAT)
Thanks anyway
EXT ED’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc lugs the heavy Mulitmixer back to his car He lifts it
into the trunk wincing from his bad back

INT KROC’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

sales call DEE DEE’S DRIVE-IN - 1 PM

INT KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc sits in his car waiting for his food He looks at his
watch It’s 1250 He lets out a heaving exasperated sigh

KROC’S POV the view out his windshield a rowdy TEEN-HANGOUT
SCENE Rock-and-roll blasting from cars female CARHOPS on
rollerskates dodging grabby male patrons leather-jacketed
cigarette-smoking hoodlums smacking each other around

Kroc is the oldest customer by a mile--and seemingly the only
one with anywhere to be He HONKS his horn summoning his
CARHOP She comes skating over holding a tray of Cokes

RAY KROC
Miss how much longer

CARHOP GIRL
Should be any minute

RAY KROC
You said that 20 minutes ago

CARHOP GIRL
I’m sorry were real--

She JUMPS-SQUEALS startled The tray of Cokes goes flying
into the car SPILLING ALL OVER KROC’S LAP Several glasses
and plates fall on the ground SHATTERING

Carhop Girl spins around sees a GUY behind her cracking up
He just pinched her butt
CARHOP
Dennis
(re Kroc soaked)
Look what you made me do

DENNIS
Sorry gramps

Dennis scampers off toward his pack of laughing friends The
carhop goes chasing after him mad but not actually mad

ON KROC-- looking down at the pool of bubbly brown liquid in
his lap He HONKS leans out the window

RAY KROC
Could I get some napkins

No one hears him

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
ANGLE ON the pants drying on the shower’s curtain rod

RAY KROC (0S)
It’s going great

CUT TO the NEXT ROOM Kroc sitting on the bed on the phone

ETHEL KROC (0S)
Of course Ray Why wouldn’t I
SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc sits on the edge of the bed roiling from the call He
takes off his shirt undressing for bed His bare torso bears
numerous surgery scars heart gall bladder etc

He reaches over to the night stand grabs a fifth of Canadian
Club Unscrews the cap

SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc in pajamas stands before a PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH He
drops the needle on a record

SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc lies in bed in the darkened room eyes closed A
soothing baritone fills the air--

RECORD (0S)

Nothing in the world can take the
place of persistence Talent will
not nothing is more common than
unsuccessful men with talent
Genius will not unrewarded genius
is almost a proverb

ANGLE ON record sleeve next to the phonograph “THE POWER OF
THE POSITIVE” BY DR CLARENCE FLOYD NELSON

RECORD (CONTD)

Education will not the world is
full of educated derelicts
Persistence and determination alone
are omnipotent

QUICK CUTS to other snippets of the record

RECORD (CONTD)

So I grabbed that brush and I
shined up those boots so bright
Pastor Walker could see his
reflection in them

Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
The lesson there being it’s not
what you do but how you do it Any
job worth doing is worth doing
well
Later--
RECORD (CONTD)
As I like to say it’s not the size
of the dog in the fight it’s the
size of the fight in the dog
Later--
RECORD (CONTD)
Misfortune is just a stepping stone
to fortune
Later--
RECORD (CONTD)
And I said to myself “Clarence
you’ve got to muddle through this”
Later--
RECORD (CONTD)
How a man handles adversity is the
true measure of a man
Later--

RECORD (CONT’D)
Heck anyone can paddle in a
sunshower

RAY KROC

Click Kroc stares at the receiver What the hell was that

EXT MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc stands over a US ROAD MAP on the hood of his car He
unfolds it opening the map westward (Note This part of the
map is not well-worn like the Midwest it’s virgin territory
for Kroc)

Kroc’s eyes drift westward to California They land on a
small town 60 miles east of Los Angeles San Bernardino

Kroc looks at the whole country He notices something A road
directly connecting St Louis to San Bernardino Route 66

ON KROC-- staring at Route 66 A single unbroken line
running from where he is now to that mysterious city out in
Southern California

EXT ROUTE 66 - DAY

Kroc driving west on Route 66 Cars the open road a
limitless horizon The sky the country the whole world
seems to open up His heart swells with possibility The
vastness excites his brain This must be how Lewis and Clark
felt And then

EXT SAN BERNARDINO CITY LIMITS - ROUTE 66 - DAY

Kroc arrives in San Bernardino A drab dusty little town on
the edge of the desert Hardly the pot of gold at the end of
the rainbow he was expecting He continues along Route 66
heading toward the center of town

SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc driving He sees the line before he sees the restaurant
A long line hundreds of people snaking toward a HAMBURGER
STAND in the distance

ON KROC-- taking in the strange sight of people out of their
cars queued up in a line leading toward a self-service
window It’s a distinctly FAMILY CROWD lots of parents with

their children Not a teenage delinquent in sight

He parks gets out Unsure what to do he gets in the line
He looks off at the restaurant checks his watch It’s 115

WOMAN (0S)
Don’t worry It moves fast

ANGLE ON the WOMAN in front of him No sooner does she say

this than the line moves Kroc shuffles forward 10 feet

SHORT TIME LATER--

Kroc in line significantly further along He looks at his

watch It’s 119

EXT MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc at the front of the line He checks his watch 123
CASHIER (0S)

Welcome to McDonald’s may I take
your order

Kroc looks up sees a CASHIER looking at him with a friendly
smile Like all the other cashiers he’s male and wholesome
as apple pie

RAY KROC
Um yes

He looks at the MENU BOARD It has just FOUR ITEMS burgers
fries shakes and Coca-Cola A radical departure from the
typical sprawling drive-in menu

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Hamburger fries and a Coca-Cola

CASHIER
45 cents please

Kroc hands him two quarters

CASHIER (CONTD)
And five cents is your change

Kroc barely has time to put the nickel away when--

CASHIER (CONTD)
Here you are

The cashier hands him a paper sack Kroc looks at it with
confusion

RAY KROC
What’s this

CASHIER
Your food

RAY KROC
I just ordered

CASHIER
(shrugs smiles)
And now it’s here

Kroc peers into the bag Lo and behold inside is a burger
fries and a Coca-Cola He sees it’s all wrapped in PAPER

RAY KROC
(Where are the”--)
Silverware Plates

CASHIER
You just eat it straight out of the
wrapper Then throw it all out

ON KROC-- bewildered He takes the bag unsure what to do

RAY KROC
So now I bring it back to my car
CASHIER
Most folks do Or you could eat it
in the park at home anywhere

you like

Kroc nods This is all so strange to him He turns heads
toward his car On the way he spots an EMPTY BENCH He
impulsively takes a seat

Kroc reaches into the bag in his lap He takes out the
hamburger noting the paper packaging He unwraps the burger
looking at it sniffing it It looks and smells wonderful

As he’s about to take a bite out the corner of his eye he
notices in a nearby car a GORGEOUS BLONDE

KROC’S POV The blonde biting into a hamburger As she
chews a look of ecstasy comes over her face She closes her
eyes her head tipping back a bit borderline orgasmic

ON KROC-- staring at the blonde

MOTHER (0S)
May we

Kroc is shaken out of his reverie by a FAMILY OF FOUR looking
to sit on the bench He slides over making room

MOTHER (CONTD)
Thank you

Kroc’s attention shifts from the blonde to the family He
discretely watches as the mother passes out burgers to her
two young kids The kids bite into them “mmm”-ing audibly

ON KROC-- observing this family of four wholesome as can be
devouring their delicious McDonald’s hamburgers

Kroc looks at the burger in his own hand takes a bite As he
chews his eyes roll back in his head

MAN (0S)
How is everything

Kroc looks up sees a MAN standing before him His necktie
and demeanor suggest manager

RAY KROC
This is the best burger I ever had

MAC MCDONALD
Care for a little tour

There’s nothing Kroc would like more

INT KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

A bustling kitchen organized as a series of stations

MAC MCDONALD (0S)
Speed

ON MAC-- leading Kroc through the kitchen

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
That’s the name of the game

They come to a massive GRILL manned by THREE COOKS

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
First stop for every McDonalds
hamburger is the grill manned by
three cooks whose sole job is to
grill those all-beef beauties to
perfection

Kroc watches the mouth-watering beef sizzling on the grill

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Meanwhile

He leads Kroc to an adjacent station where two DRESSERS
stand before a rotating Lazy Susan with 24 BUN TOPS on it

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
As the patty cooks our “dressers”
get the bun ready

DRESSER 1 puts pickle slices and onion on each bun--

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Every McDonald’s hamburger gets two
pickles a pinch of onion

--while DRESSER 2 applies a squirt of ketchup and mustard
with a pair of trigger-operated CONDIMENT GUNS

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
»and a precise shot of ketchup
and mustard

RAY KROC
(re condiment guns)
Where’d you get those things

MAC MCDONALD
We made ‘em

RAY KROC
Made them

MAC MCDONALD
Custom built Whole kitchen is

ON KROC-- utterly amazed

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
(resuming tour)
Next it’s off to the finishing
station

ANGLE ON the Lazy Susan carrying 24 fully dressed bun tops
traveling along a belt toward a FINISHING STATION

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Where it all comes together

A pair of FINISHERS put cooked patties onto the fully dressed
bun tops then put on bun bottoms and neatly wrap it up

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Voila

The finished product is fed into an angled metal sleeve that
slides them to the front counter where cashiers can grab and
bag them with ease

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
A fresh and delicious hamburger
grill to counter in 30 seconds

ON KROC-- dumbfounded by what he’s seen He looks at Mac

RAY KROC
How

MAC MCDONALD
Did I come up with all of this
(sly smile)
I didn’t
Kroc is confused

MAC MCDONALD (CONT’D)
We did

Kroc follows Mac’s eyes to a MAN coming toward them

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Dick McDonald My brother

Kroc grabs Dick’s hand enthusiastically shakes
RAY KROC

I just have to say what you’ve
done here is nothing short of--

DICK MCDONALD
(to Mac ignoring Ray)
The fries

MAC MCDONALD
What about ‘em

Dick leads Mac toward the FRENCH FRY STATION Kroc follows
along Dick plucks a fry off the drying rack hands it to
Mac who pops it in his mouth

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Perfect

DICK MCDONALD
They’re five percent too crisp

Dick takes a fry tastes it Frowns

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
I think we should drop to two
minutes 50 seconds

MAC MCDONALD
That’s what you had it at before

DICK MCDONALD
400 not 375 Higher temp shorter
cook

Mac takes another taste

MAC MCDONALD
I really think they’re spot-on

RAY KROC
(to Dick)
If it makes any difference they’re
the best fries I’ve ever tasted
Crispy golden brown on the outside
fluffy on the inside Not too oily
perfectly salty and crunchy

Dick looks at Ray taking note of him for the first time

DICK MCDONALD
Who are you

MAC MCDONALD
This is that Multimixer fella you
spoke to

RAY KROC
Ray Kroc Prince Castle Sales

Kroc hands Dick his card Dick gives it a cursory glance

DICK MCDONALD
How soon you figure we can expect
‘em

RAY KROC
I’m sending them Blue Label Air
You should have it early next week

DICK MCDONALD
Good

With this Dick abruptly walks off Ray gives chase

RAY KROC
Wait

He catches up grabs Dick’s arm

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Let me take you out to dinner

DICK MCDONALD

(jokey)
Youre really not my type

RAY KROC
You and your brother

Mac a few feet away comes over curious

MAC MCDONALD
What for

RAY KROC

I’m gonna shoot straight with you
fellas This restaurant is the most
remarkable thing I’ve seen in all
my years in the food-service
industry And believe you me I’ve
seen it all I want to know
everything about it Where it came
from how you thought of it

(BEAT)
Please Tell me your story

INT STEAKHOUSE - EVENING

Kroc sits across from the brothers in a corner booth rib eye
steaks in front of all three

MAC MCDONALD
There wasn’t a job in all of
Manchester All of New Hampshire
So we packed our bags and headed
west To Hollywood I wanted to be
in the movie business And Dick
well he wanted to be

DICK MCDONALD
Employed

MAC MCDONALD
We landed jobs driving trucks for
Columbia Pictures After a few
years we had enough saved up to
buy our own little piece of show
business A little movie theater
out in Glendora Which would’ve
been swell except for the small
matter of timing It was September
of ‘29 One minute we’re screening
“Gold Diggers Of Broadway” the
next it’s “Brother can you spare a
dime” Literally

DICK MCDONALD
I couldn’t

MAC MCDONALD
Nobody in town was making any
money Except this one fella Wylie
Reid Ran a hot dog and root beer
stand People still gotta eat
right So we decide to set up our
own stand hot dogs and orange
juice out in Arcadia

EXT ARCADIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A YOUNG DICK AND MAC manning their dusty roadside HOT DOG
STAND during the Great Depression A smattering of CUSTOMERS

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
It did okay enough to keep us off
the bread line but we were hardly
doing gangbusters There just
weren’t enough people in Arcadia

BACK TO PRESENT-—

MAC MCDONALD

Meanwhile one town over is San
Bernardino the place is growing at
a terrific clip We want to
relocate but we’ve got no money
for a new stand That’s when my
brother here gets one of his
brilliant ideas Tell him Dick

Dick throws Mac a “That’s okay you tell him” nod

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
“Why don’t we move the stand we’ve
got Put it on a truck”

(BEAT)

Genius right Except one small
problem On the road between the
towns there’s an overpass The
building doesn’t clear I figure
that’s it we’re done for But then
Dick says

Another nod of deferral from Dick

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
“Why don’t we saw the restaurant in
half”

EXT ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Dick and Mac driving an old flatbed Ford On the back is the
stand SPLIT IN TWO The truck goes under an overpass
narrowly clearing

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
We truck the darn thing over in two
pieces put it back together

BACK TO PRESENT--
Kroc guffaws with amazement

MAC MCDONALD
We move the building set up shop
But before we open we decide to
give the place a little tweak It’s
1940 Drive-ins are all the rage
the hottest thing going I say
Dick we gotta get in on this Dick
says sure

EXT MCDONALD’S FAMOUS BARBECUE - DAY

The brothers’ proto-McDonald’s up and running Pretty

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
Two months later we open for
business

(show-biz hands)
“McDonald’s Famous Barbecue”

(FLASHBACK)

CARHOPS in tasseled short skirts and Western boots hustle
about serving customers

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
Weve got a 27-item menu barbecue
slow-cooked in a real pit out back
Uniformed waitresses bring the food
straight out to your car It does
gangbusters Going great guns But
then sales start to level off

BACK TO PRESENT-—

DICK MCDONALD
The drive-in model as we learn
has a few built-in problems

Kroc leans in eager to hear their take on this

Kroc nods

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
For starters there’s the customer
issue Drive-ins tend to attract
shall we say a less-than desirable
clientele

MAC MCDONALD
Teenagers

DICK MCDONALD
Hot rodders and hooligans Juvenile
delinquents in blue jeans

all too familiar

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Then there’s the service It takes
forever and a day for your food to
arrive And when it finally does--

RAY KROC
It’s completely wrong
Kroc nods

DICK MCDONALD
The carhops are too busy dodging
gropes to remember you wanted a
strawberry phosphate not cherry

RAY KROC
If they remember at all

MAC MCDONALD
Then there’s the expenses Payroll
is high due to the large staff
required Dishes are constantly
getting stolen or broken

DICK MCDONALD
Tremendous overhead

MAC MCDONALD
But one day Dick has a realization
Going over the books he notices
something The bulk of our sales
come from just three items
Burgers fries soft drinks

DICK MCDONALD
87 percent

MAC MCDONALD
We say to ourselves what the heck
are we doing monkeying around with
all this other stuff Focus on what
sells

Yes

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
And that’s just what we do
Brisket gone Tamales gone And
we don’t stop at the menu We look
at everything What else don’t we
need

DICK MCDONALD
Turns out quite a lot

MAC MCDONALD
Carhops

DICK MCDONALD
Walk up to a window Get your food
yourself

MAC MCDONALD
Dishes

DICK MCDONALD
All paper packaging Disposable

MAC MCDONALD
Jukeboxes cigarette machines

DICK MCDONALD
Drive out the riff-raff

RAY KROC
(totally in sync)
Create a family-friendly
environment

MAC MCDONALD
And finally the biggest most
important cut of all the wait

DICK MCDONALD
Orders ready in 30 seconds not 30
minutes

MAC MCDONALD
We decide to tear down the kitchen
Rebuild Reconfigure Rethink the
whole dang thing And you’re gonna
love how we do it Tell him Dick

DICK MCDONALD
The tennis court

MAC MCDONALD
He brings me out to this tennis
court draws an outline in the
dirt Exact dimensions of our
kitchen

EXT TENNIS COURT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A TENNIS COURT somewhere in San Bernardino Mac watches as
Dick carefully draws a KITCHEN OUTLINE on it with a stick

MAC MCDONALD (VO)

We bring in a bunch of employees
have ‘em go through the motions

making pretend burgers and fries

--An invisible kitchen YOUNG EMPLOYEES mimicking the moves
trying to get it right

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
Dick’s chasing after them with the
stick marking up where all the
equipment should go They do it
over and over hashing out the
moves choreographing like it’s
some sort of crazy burger ballet

--Over and over It’s starting to get dark

DICK MCDONALD (VO)
Finally after about six hours of
this we get it just right

--Workers making pretend burgers and fries in perfect sync

DICK MCDONALD (VO)
A symphony of efficiency Not a
wasted motion

BACK TO PRESENT-—

DICK MCDONALD
We take the layout to a builder
custom build to exact specs

MAC MCDONALD
Ta-da The Speedee System is born
The world’s first-ever system
designed to deliver food fast It’s
totally revolutionary

DICK MCDONALD
And a complete disaster

EXT MCDONALD’S - DAY (FLASHBACK)
The grand opening The hungry and the curious pulling up

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
Opening day people pull into the
lot immediately start honking when
no carhop comes over We try to
explain the walk-up window They’re
bewildered Furious “Whaddaya mean
I gotta get out of my car”

BACK TO PRESENT-—

MAC MCDONALD
Most of them just cuss us out and
drive off The few that stick
around are mad as heck about having
to eat off paper and discard their
own trash

DICK MCDONALD
We may have underestimated the
learning curve

MAC MCDONALD

By five o’clock Dick’s calculating
the cost of converting back to
drive-in But me I’m not quite
ready to throw in the towel Going
back to my Hollywood roots I say
to myself “We gotta go big with
this We gotta put on a show” I
tell Dick I want to throw a grand
re-opening A gala premiere to put
Louis B Mayer to shame

EXT GRAND RE-OPENING - EVENING (FLASHBACK)
The fast-food equivalent of a Hollywood-style premiere

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
We rent a bunch of spotlights the
same ones we used to truck around
to premieres in the Columbia days
I get sparklers a juggler for the
kiddies--it’s an event People show
up in droves And then

DICK MCDONALD (VO)
The flies

--An ominous cloud gathers over the restaurant A SWARM OF
INSECTS They swoop down in unison as if in attack mode

DICK MCDONALD (VO)
They must’ve been drawn by all the
lights

MAC MCDONALD (VO)
Millions of ‘em Looked like
something out of Exodus

--Customers running screaming Swatting

DICK MCDONALD (VO)
The Pharaoh would’ve released the
Israelites

BACK TO PRESENT-—

MAC MCDONALD

It’s a total disaster Towel time

(BEAT)
The next morning Dick and I meet
up to discuss going back to the old
format As we’re talking there’s a
knock at the service window Dick
goes over sees a little boy
standing there He wants a bag of
burgers

INT MCDONALD’S - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Dick at the service window looking at a YOUNG KID His nose
barely clears the counter

DICK MCDONALD
And it’s off to the races

MAC MCDONALD
We’re an overnight sensation
Thirty years in the making

ON KROC-- absorbing all of this blown away
Mac gives Kroc a modest little shrug

MAC MCDONALD (CONTD)
So that’s our story

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kroc lies awake in bed buzzing unable to sleep

EXT MCDONALDS - NEXT MORNING

Dick and Mac pull into the McDonald’s lot in Dick’s car
They’re startled to see--

Kroc sitting out front He approaches their car Before Dick
can fully roll down his window

RAY KROC
Franchise

DICK MCDONALD
Beg pardon

RAY KROC
Franchise franchise the thing
It’s too good to just be one
location There ought to be
McDonald’s everywhere Coast to
coast sea to shining sea And I’m
just the man to help you do it
I’ve spent the better part of my
life criss-crossing this country I
know every highway and byway every
city and every town

DICK MCDONALD
Mr Kroc

RAY KROC
Let me just say one thing One more
thing

(MORE )

RAY KROC (CONTD)
I want to confess something to you
boys I’m not out here in
California on any business meeting
I’m out here for you You’re what
brought me out A few days ago I
was standing outside a filling
station in St Louis Missouri
staring at a US road map staring
at a long white unbroken line
called Route 66 I took my finger--

DICK MCDONALD
Mr Kroc-—-

RAY KROC
I took my finger and I traced that
line from where I was standing all
the way out to California where it
ran smack-dab into this place we
are now As I stared at that line
something told me to follow it
Something told me to get in my car
and see what’s out there at the
other end And when I laid eyes on
your hamburger stand yesterday all
those people lined up to purchase
your remarkable product I knew it
was--

DICK MCDONALD
We already tried

INT MCDONALDS - BACK OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
Three in Southern California one
in Sacramento and one in Phoenix
(BEAT)
And that’s all there’1l ever be

RAY KROC
Why
DICK MCDONALD
Two words Quality control It’s
almost impossible to enforce
standards from afar

MAC MCDONALD
Those places were a mess Filthy
kitchens inconsistent menus

DICK MCDONALD
Sacramento was selling burritos

MAC MCDONALD
To watch your precious creation get
mismanaged like that Your name

DICK MCDONALD
Put Mac in the hospital

Kroc looks at Mac surprised

MAC MCDONALD
Diabetes and extreme stress don’t
mix

A BEAT as Kroc absorbs this

RAY KROC
But if you had somebody in charge
of supervising

MAC MCDONALD
We did

RAY KROC
What happened

DICK MCDONALD
He obviously didn’t do a great job

RAY KROC
So replace him With someone
better

DICK MCDONALD
Our energies are better spent
making this place the best it can
possibly be

MAC MCDONALD
Better one great restaurant than 50
mediocre ones

RAY KROC
Sure but I still think if you had
the right--

DICK MCDONALD
Thank you we’re not interested

RAY KROC
Someone as committed to quality as--

DICK MCDONALD
Thank you

Kroc backs off A BEAT of awkward silence

Kroc’s eye goes to something else on the wall a BLUEPRINT
The building has towering arches on each side

RAY KROC
What’s that

DICK MCDONALD
A blueprint

RAY KROC
Those

Mac follows Kroc’s eyes to the arches
MAC MCDONALD
It’s a way to make the place stand

out when you’re driving past

DICK MCDONALD
“The Golden Arches” I call ‘em

Kroc stares at them fascinated It’s a crazy radical (and
kind of brilliant) thing to stick on the sides of a building

RAY KROC
Who thought of that

MAC MCDONALD
That’s pure Dick magic right there

Dick’s gaze is still on the arches clearly proud

RAY KROC
Ever do one like that

DICK MCDONALD
Just one

Glorious magical

He does a slow lap around the building taking in the arches
from all angles Halfway around the shifting perspective

INT BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Kroc stands before the brothers

RAY KROC
That drive back home on 66 I
passed through a lot of towns A
lot of small towns In the middle
of each one of them was a Main
Street And on each of those Main
Streets were always the same two
things a courthouse and a church
A courthouse topped with a flag A
church topped with a cross Flags
and crosses crosses and flags

The brothers look at each other unsure where this is going

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
As I drove along I pondered those
crosses and flags I asked myself
why they’re so ubiquitous What
they mean And as I did I couldn’t
help but think about your
restaurant About these--

He goes over to the blueprint plants a finger on the arches

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

Now forgive me if this flirts with
blasphemy but to my mind these
arches share a great deal in common
with the Christian cross and the
American flag A building topped
with a cross is a gathering place
A place where decent wholesome
folks can come together and be with
others who share their values The
same can be said of a building
flanked by a pair of your arches
Those arches mean more than simply
“delicious hamburgers inside” They
signify family Community The ties
that bind They represent goodness
togetherness a place for Americans
to gather and break bread
McDonald’s can be that too The
new American church feeding bodies
and feeding souls And not just on
Sundays Seven days a week

(BEAT)
Crosses Flags Arches

similar reaction He’s surprised to see a conflicted look on

JOAN SMITH (CONTD)
I think it’s a marvelous idea

ON KROC-- privately quivering at the touch

Could I interest anyone in dessert

The WAITER holds out a dessert menu to the table
ROLLIE SMITH
No thanks Vic
(to Kroc cryptic smile)
We brought our own
MOMENTS LATER--

ANGLE ON a pair of SILVER-FOIL PACKETS in front of Joan

JOAN SMITH
Chocolate or vanilla

RAY KROC
Vanilla

Joan takes one of the packets marked “V” dumps the powdery
contents into a glass She pours in some water stirs

ON KROC-- watching with fascination as it thickens Within
seconds it transforms into what looks like a vanilla shake

Joan slides it to Kroc All eyes on him as he takes a sip A
long anxious BEAT from the table

JOAN SMITH
What do you think

RAY KROC
I think I’m drinking a delicious
vanilla shake

The table erupts in happy relieved laughter

JOAN SMITH
May I

Kroc follows her eyes to the shake He gives her a “be my
guest” nod She raises the glass to her lips takes a long
languorous sip Kroc watches highly turned on

She puts the glass down smiles at Kroc

JOAN SMITH (CONTD)
I couldn’t resist

Kroc’s gaze drifts to the glass On the rim is a bright-red
LIPSTICK MARK He stares at it

ROLLIE SMITH (0S)
So whaddaya say

Kroc looks at Rollie shaken out of his moment
ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
We try it out at our place Then

if it goes well

JOAN SMITH
You roll it out nationally

ON KROC-- suddenly a tad queasy thinking of the brothers He
nods vaguely

RAY KROC
I could

A strange shaky BEAT

RAY KROC (CONTD)
Let me think about it

Rollie and Joan nod surprised They were expecting a big
unreserved yes

ROLLIE SMITH
Of course You’re the boss

Kroc nods privately churning If they only knew

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kroc is sitting on the bed looking at the Inst-A-Mix ad in
“Restaurant Business Monthly” On the nightstand is a pint of
Four Roses bourbon empty He dials the phone

RAY KROC
Just hear me out

INT MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - NIGHT

DICK MCDONALD
(instantly wary)
Hello Ray

ON MAC-- cleaning up in the background His ears prick up

RAY KROC
What if I told you there was a way
to save you me and all our owner-
operators literally hundreds of
dollars a year in electrical costs

DICK MCDONALD
And what would that be

RAY KROC

Two words Powdered milkshake

(before Dick can reply--)
There’s a remarkable new product I
recently came across called Inst-A-
Mix It’s a powdered milkshake
costs a fraction of ice cream no
refrigeration necessary

DICK MCDONALD
Ray--

RAY KROC
I tried it and let me tell you it
is delicious Tastes just like the
real thing

DICK MCDONALD
Is this some sort of joke

RAY KROC
Comes in vanilla or chocolate

DICK MCDONALD
Ray

RAY KROC
Me I’m a vanilla man

DICK MCDONALD
I have no interest in a milkshake
that contains no milk

RAY KROC
You won’t be able to tell the
difference Guarantee

DICK MCDONALD
Why don’t we put sawdust in the
hamburgers while we’re at it

RAY KROC
I’m being serious

DICK MCDONALD
Frozen french fries

RAY KROC
You don’t want to save a bundle

DICK MCDONALD
Not like that

RAY KROC
We’re talking the same great taste
while boosting your bottom line

DICK MCDONALD
It’s called a milk shake Ray

RAY KROC
Not to mention freeing up all that
cooler space I don’t know about
you but I’d sure like to--

DICK MCDONALD
Milk Now and forever

ON KROC-- shut down Yet again

RAY KROC
Well thanks for giving it your
full and sincere consideration
(fed up)
As always

INT KROC’S OFFICE - DAY

Kroc stares at the ever-growing mountain of bills on his

marked FINAL NOTICE

INT ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY
Kroc is sitting with Harvey Peltz his home-mortgage officer

RAY KROC
Youve got to extend my line

HARVEY PELTZ
Until you build more equity in your
home or pay down the loan

RAY KROC
My business is booming

HARVEY PELTZ
Unfortunately that’s immaterial

RAY KROC
Thirteen locations in nine states

HARVEY PELTZ
It’s a home-equity loan

RAY KROC
Then give me a business loan

REVEAL on the other side of a partition a patrician silver-
haired BUSINESSMAN sitting across from an empty chair
listening in as he waits for his banker to return

HARVEY PELTZ
These 13 locations They’re yours

RAY KROC
Meaning

HARVEY PELTZ
You own them

RAY KROC
I mean not in the strict sense

HARVEY PELTZ
So then what are your assets

RAY KROC
Mine personally

HARVEY PELTZ
It is your business correct You
own it

RAY KROC
Not technically per se

The businessman cringes for the poor floundering schlub on
the other side of the partition

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
I’m the head of franchising I’m
the one behind all the growth

HARVEY PELTZ
That’s all well and good but--

RAY KROC
Have you ever been to a McDonald’s

The name catches the businessman’s ear

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

We’ve got three stores right here
in the Chicagoland area Perhaps if
you swung by took a look

HARVEY PELTZ
That’s quite alright

RAY KROC
Id be happy to give you a tour
give you a better sense of--
HARVEY PELTZ
Thank you I’ve got the gist
EXT ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc exits the bank in defeat He slumps off toward his car

BUSINESSMAN
Mr Kroc

Kroc turns sees the man approaching Kroc looks him over
Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit he has the finished
cosmopolitan air of a New Yorker

RAY KROC
Can I help you

BUSINESSMAN
No But perhaps I can help you
He hands Kroc a business card Kroc looks at it

HARRY J SONNEBORN - VICE-PRESIDENT OF FINANCE -
FREEZ CORPORATION

RAY KROC
Thanks We’re perfectly happy with
our current supplier

Kroc hands back the card starts to walk off

HARRY SONNEBORN
I’m not looking to sell you ice
cream

RAY KROC
Then what do you want

HARRY SONNEBORN
I caught a bit of your conversation
back there Sounds like you’re
having some financial troubles

RAY KROC
Why don’t you mind your own
business

HARRY SONNEBORN
I’m a great admirer of your
establishment

RAY KROC
That’s very nice

HARRY SONNEBORN
I lunch at your Waukegan location
at least thrice a week And not
once have I ever failed to witness
a large avid crowd

RAY KROC
Your point being

HARRY SONNEBORN
If you’re not making money hand
over fist something is gravely
amiss

This gets Kroc’s attention

THE TASTEE-

INT PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

Kroc enters the office with Sonneborn As they pass the front
desk

RAY KROC
June fetch the ledger

INT KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
Kroc and Sonneborn sit in front of the ledger

HARRY SONNEBORN

So to summarize you have a
miniscule revenue stream no cash
reserves and an albatross of a
contract that requires you to go
through a glacially slow approval
process to enact changes--if
they’re approved at all Which they
never are

(BEAT)
Am I missing anything

RAY KROC
I believe that covers it

ON SONNEBORN-- thinking

HARRY SONNEBORN
Tell me about the land

RAY KROC
Land

HARRY SONNEBORN
The land the buildings how that
whole aspect of it works

RAY KROC
Well it’s pretty simple really
The franchisee finds a piece of
land he likes takes out a lease
Usually 20-year He gets himself a
construction loan puts up the
building and off he goes

HARRY SONNEBORN
So the operator selects the site

RAY KROC
Yes
HARRY SONNEBORN
He picks the property Not you

Kroc nods unsure why he’s so curious about all of this

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
You supply the training the
system the operational know-how
and he’s responsible for the rest

RAY KROC
Correct

ON SONNEBORN-- processing He seems troubled

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Is there a problem

HARRY SONNEBORN
A big one

RAY KROC
Which is

HARRY SONNEBORN
That you don’t seem to realize what
business you’re in
(BEAT)
You’re not in the burger business
Youre in the real-estate business

Kroc looks totally confused

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
You don’t build an empire off a 14
percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger
You build it by owning the land
upon which that burger is cooked

ON KROC-- wrestling with this strange notion

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
What you ought to be doing is
buying up plots of land then
turning around and leasing said
plots to franchisees who as a
condition of their deal should be
permitted to lease from you and you
alone This will provide you with
two things One a steady upfront
revenue stream Money flows in
before the first stake is in the
ground Two greater capital for
expansion

(MORE )

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
Which in turn fuels further land
acquisition which in turn fuels
further expansion And so on and so

on
(BEAT)

Land That’s where the money is
(BEAT)

And control Control over the
franchisee Fail to uphold quality
standards you cancel their lease
Control over Dick and Mac Their
power stops at the building’s
foundation Yours goes to the soil

ON KROC-- absorbing registering the full significance

RAY KROC
If I were to do this the
brothers this would
effectively

HARRY SONNEBORN
Yes

A long BEAT Kroc searching his soul We can almost see the
Angel and the Devil on his shoulders

HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)

So whaddaya say Ray

I just have to ask you one thing
Something I’ve never understood

RAY KROC
Alright

DICK MCDONALD
That day we met when we gave you
the tour

RAY KROC
What about it

DICK MCDONALD
We showed you everything The whole
system all our secrets We were an
open book
(Kroc nods)
So why didn’t you just--

RAY KROC
Rip you off Run off and start my
own place using your ideas
(Dick nods)
Because it would have failed

DICK MCDONALD
How do you know

RAY KROC
Am I the only one who ever got the
kitchen tour I bet you invited
loads of people back there
Countless would-be burger barons
looking to replicate your success

DICK MCDONALD
And

RAY KROC
How many succeeded

DICK MCDONALD
Lots of people started restaurants

RAY KROC
Bigger than McDonalds
(Dick is silent)
Of course not No one has and no
one ever will Because they all
lack that one thing that makes
McDonalds special

DICK MCDONALD
Which is

RAY KROC
Even you don’t know

DICK MCDONALD
Enlighten me

RAY KROC
It’s not just the system It’s the
name

Dick doesn’t follow

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

That name That glorious name
McDonald It’s wide open
Limitless It could be anything
whatever you want it to be It
sounds like America

(BEAT)
Compare that to oh say Kroc Now
there’s a real lemon Kroc What a
crock Load of crock Crock of
shit Would you eat at a place
called Kroc’s It’s enough to make
you lose your appetite a blunt
Slavic thing like that But
McDonalds now that’s a name A
fine handsome all-American name
That’s a winner’s name the name of
somebody who’s got the world by the
tail A man named McDonald is never
going to get pushed around in life

DICK MCDONALD
That’s clearly not the case
RAY KROC
So you don’t have a check for 135
million in your pocket

Dick is silenced

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
That’s the mistake your competitors
made All those would-be imitators
They assumed they could simply take
your system slap on some name like
Hamburger Hamlet or Roscoe’s and
presto Instant success Not me I
wasn’t so arrogant I knew there’s
no beating a name like McDonald’s

DICK MCDONALD
And if you can’t beat ‘em

RAY KROC
Buy ‘em

Dick chuckles in disgust

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Ill never forget the first time I
saw that name stretched across the
front of your stand It was love at
first sight From that moment I
knew I just had to have it And now
I do

DICK MCDONALD
You don’t “have” it

RAY KROC
You sure about that

Kroc throws him an unnerving smile

EXT MCDONALD’S (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

ANGLE ON the McDonald’s sign in front of the restaurant

PAN DOWN TO Dick and Mac with Kroc’s lawyers listening

like they’re being read their Miranda rights

KROC LAWYER
As per the terms of your agreement
while you are entitled to maintain
ownership of this location you no
longer have the right to call it
McDonald’s McDonald or any other
such variation so as to create
confusion or infringe upon the
McDonalds trademark which is now
the exclusive intellectual property
of Mr Raymond A Kroc

DISSOLVE TO

Workers dismantling the McDonald’s sign The brothers watch
helplessly as their name is removed from their own store

DISSOLVE TO
A new sign going up in its place With a new name--
THE BIG M
Below this it says with a whiff of desperation
“WE HAVE BEEN HERE 23 YEARS”

The sign is as close to a McDonald’s marquee as is legally
possible but it’s just not McDonald’s It’s heartbreaking

PAN ACROSS THE STREET where we see

A NEW MCDONALD’S under construction A hard-hatted Kroc is on
site watching as the signature Golden Arches go up

YOUNG MAN (0S)
Mr Kroc

A YOUNG MAN comes over slightly nervous to approach

YOUNG MAN (CONTD)
My name is Will Davis Ima
reporter for the Los Angeles Times
I’m interested in doing a profile
of you pegged to the opening of
your hundredth location here

A BEAT as Kroc thinks it over

RAY KROC
Call my office They’1l set it up

He reaches into the breast pocket of his sport coat

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Here’s my card

He hands a BUSINESS CARD to the reporter He looks at it

ANGLE ON card Beneath a McDonald’s logo it says simply
RAY KROC - FOUNDER

We hold on this for a long BEAT

RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
Now I know what you’re thinking

EXT BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - DAY

A lavish gated MANSION A BLACK LIMOUSINE pulls into the
driveway

INT MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A tuxedo-clad Ray Kroc stands before a mirror stack of index
cards in hand He’s 68 now it’s nine years later 1970

RAY KROC
How the heck does an over-the-hill
52-year-old milkshake-machine
salesman build a fast-food empire
with 1600 restaurants in 50 states
and five foreign countries with
annual revenues in the neighborhood
of 700 million It’s quite simple
persistence

He turns to the next card

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

Nothing in the world can take the
place of good old persistence
Talent won’t Nothing’s more common
than unsuccessful men with talent
Genius won’t Unrecognized genius
is practically a cliché

His words have a familiar ring They’re lifted straight
from “The Power Of The Positive” by Dr Clarence Floyd Nelson
(the record from the beginning of the movie) with just a bit
of rephrasing to make it “his own”

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Education won’t The world is full
of educated fools

(MORE )

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
Persistence and determination alone
are all-powerful

He pauses a beat to let his words of wisdom sink in

RAY KROC (CONT’D)
There’s no obstacle under the sun
that can’t be overcome with honest
hard work and determination It’s
these core principles that enabled
me to rise to the top of the heap
at a point in life when most men
would be thinking about retirement

(glances to side sly

grin)
We appear to have that in common
Mr Governor

He pauses for laughter

RAY KROC (CONTD)
You were what 55 when you started
in politics Why you make me look
like a spring chicken

Another pause for laughter

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

Look at us a couple of small-town
Illinois boys made good Only in
America

He continues talking to Mr Governor off to the side--

RAY KROC (CONT’D)

By the way thank you for that
splendid introduction To be named
California Chamber of Commerce Man
of The Year is thrill enough but
to be presented the award by my
dear friend and golf buddy Ronald
Reagan well that’s just the
cherry on the sundae

He turns to the next index card

RAY KROC (CONTD)

Now where was I Ah yes the
beginning The year was 1954 The
place Des Plaines Illinois
That’s where it all started Right
there on Lee Street--

JOAN KROC (0S)
The car’s out front
Joan Smith now Joan Kroc comes up behind him
RAY KROC
(to her reflection)
Be right down
She nods exits the room
Kroc looks down at the card in his hand finding his place

IT ALL STARTED RIGHT THERE ON LEE STREET MCDONALD’S 1

RAY KROC (CONTD)
--McDonald’s 1

Kroc’s eyes linger on those words on the card MCDONALD’S 1
He looks up stares at himself in the mirror for a long BEAT

As he takes in his reflection we detect a flicker of
something on his face Regret Guilt

It may have just been our imagination

He tucks the index cards in his pocket stands up

INT LIMOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER

Kroc and Joan Smith (now JOAN KROC) ride in the back of a
stretch limo She’s in a powder-blue gown draped in diamonds
and pearls

LIMO DRIVER
Comfortable Mr Kroc

An air conditioning vent blows cool air on Kroc
RAY KROC
Oh yes
(placid)
Very

CAMERA slowly pushes in on Kroc’s face as he rides in
silence He looks at Joan smiles

He indeed seems comfortable Very

FADE TO BLACK

POSTSCRIPT

Ray Kroc’s San Bernardino McDonald’s was an instant hit
drawing customers away from The Big M across the street
forcing it to close The McDonald brothers were driven out of
business by a McDonald’s

Kroc later reneged on the handshake deal for the one percent
cut of royalties The brothers never received a cent Today
that one percent would be worth 200 million annually Each

From the moment Kroc took ownership his business card listed
his title as “Founder” Until his death decades later calls
to McDonald’s headquarters asking the origin of the name were
told it was made up

Kroc married Joan Smith in 1969 They remained together until
his death in 1984

In 1971 Mac died of diabetes-related illness His brother
Dick passed away in 1998

Harry Sonneborn and Ray Kroc had a falling out in 1967
Sonneborn sold all his shares in McDonald’s and never spoke
to Kroc again

Thanks to Sonneborn’s idea McDonald’s is today the largest
owner of real estate in the world
