JULIE
Uh-hmm First we shake this town

(she adds cream to
his cup)

And when thats out of our system
theres a little matter of building
that house

DOLLY BACK as Jolson sits on a couch across from Steve Julie
hands Steve his coffee and starts to pour a cup for herself

STEVE
That I gotta see if I never see
another house in the world

JOLSON
Yknow I kinda got a hankerin to
see it myself

JULIE
Im glad to hear that because I can
have it up in no time I know every

room in the place Ive even got it
furnished Just one thing in our
travels to find the right place to
put that house

JOLSON
You uh -- you dont mean the east
do ya baby

She almost responds but hesitates
STEVE

That was the original idea Why
change it
JOLSON

Weve gotten used to this country

out here

I like it

I dont know

it feels more like home than any

place in the world
matter too much to you

sweetheart

No not really

With no number on the house and a

JOLSON
No kidding A week would wrap up
everything fine for me

JULIE
What have you got to wrap up

STEVE
(rising)
Nothing He just thinks he has
Nothing important at all
(to Jolson quickly)
Have a cup of coffee Al Its
great

JULIE
Look boys is something cooking

STEVE
No theres nothing cooking

JOLSON
No Baby it was just an idea
thats all Theres a proposition
come at us about putting a company
together and making our own
pictures And --

Steve looking over Julies shoulder waves to Jolson to be
quiet

JOLSON
(adding quickly)
Oh nothing definite just talking
about it Of course in a week or
so it could gel It might be a
pretty exciting thing to come back
to And well -- thats all it was
JULIE
(holding his arm)
Sorry darling No gelling First
thing you know youve set a date to
make a picture Then well have to
travel with one eye on the
calendar --

JOLSON
I promise you baby

JULIE
Or something just as bad talking
about a picture all the time were
gone

JOLSON
No sir Not a peep Give you my
word

JULIE
Fine darling But -- well I know
this is silly but its -- its

gotten to be a sort of principle
Once we do say were going to quit
for a while --

JOLSON
Oh who said we werent

JULIE
Well then whatever this proposition
is itll still be there in three
months or six months --

STEVE
And just as hot so why bother now
Why dont you lay off Al

JOLSON

(paces away)
Wow What a beating Im taking
here

(turns back)
But look honey Remember me This
is Jolson I go with the principle
every time But all Im talking
about is a couple of days

JULIE
But when you want to spend them that
way Al thats where the principle
is It isnt the days

(MORE)
JULIE (contd)

It doesnt have anything to do with
time

(crying)
If you cant see that Al I
wouldnt know how to --

(wipes her eyes)
Holy smoke this is a kid stunt
isnt it

Jolson looks at her amazed

JULIE
Ill be right back

Julie runs off

JULIE
Al youre going to hate to stop
work and go away arent you

JOLSON
No baby

JULIE
Its going to be awfully tough
isnt it Not singing always is
And here I am asking you to go away
without any plans without even any
work to come back to

we see
takes a
JOLSON
Honest it doesnt matter that much
baby You know how it is when an
old fire horse hears the bell

JULIE
I didnt say it was your fault
(rises and faces him)
Thats not what Im trying to say
What weve got to discuss is you and
me

JOLSON
Julie --

JULIE

Please Al just listen hard for
once will you

(she turns away)
You see Im like somebody with one
desperate chance left I couldnt
go on this way if I wanted to That
means youd have to change Youd
have to get off this merry-go-round
and quit for once for a long time
And I know youd make promises and
try to keep them But Id know how
you felt And I couldnt have any
happiness out of wishing the tiniest
misery on you So you see Al any
way you look at it theres got to
be misery for both of us And the
way we feel about each other and
rather than let that die a slow
painful death I think we ought to
have the courage to quit now

JOLSON
Thats the one thing that cant
happen baby

JULIE
(turns to him)
Be honest Al

JOLSON
I never understood a thing

She walks past him He speaks to her from behind
JOLSON
Look Julie Youve heard of fellas
who hit the bottle and wind up
hopeless drunks Well whatever
drives me that way and wont let me
understand its the same thing
Ive been like a fella whos been
drunk all his life And you know a
guy like thatll get so bad hell
pass up the thing he wants more than
anything else in the world

JULIE
You dont have to tell me how you
feel about me Al I know that

JOLSON
No listen baby I do have to tell
you because listen Ive been
kicked around in my time I thought
I could take anything But having
you say you want to quit because --
Well look baby If it means
losing you it isnt even a contest
I dont want any part of any more
contracts or shows or any singing
in the world

JULIE
Al you cant make me a gift of your
whole life I just couldnt take
it

JOLSON
No look baby Its given you
nothing except this show business
and thats cheated me all my life
t stands to cheat me right now
because I know what would happen
d just go on the same way working
my head off living everybodys life
but my own and at the same time
lose the only thing I was lucky to
get out of it I know what youre
thinking baby Im kidding myself
and dont know it Well maybe yes
-- I dont know When youve been
like I have all my life like a
drunk you cant quit all of a
sudden Sometimes you crave the
stuff

DOLLY IN closer as he turns her around
JOLSON
But I am sober now baby And I
want you to help me If I start
yelling hit me over the head tie
me down Because when you go baby
I got nothing left So be a pal

harmonizing with him

Papa gestures to Mama to dance with him She shakes her head
at first then gets up with him Julie looks on as they begin
to dance

Then Jolson starts to sing the chorus Julie looks at him
surprised Jolson keeps singing Steve looks at him with a
trace of sadness

Mama and Papa continue to dance

In the middle of the song Jolson raises his emotional and
volume level Julie gives Steve a concerned look as if asking
if Jolson really wants to quit singing Steve avoids her
glance and looks at Jolson

Jolson continues singing Julie gives Steve another look but
Steve can only look back with a poker face

Mama and Papa continue dancing Jolson finishes the song and
looks down thoughtfully

Julie also looks down concerned
Jolson picks up a drink

JOLSON
Well thats that

Mama and Papa look back at him

PAPA
Thank you Asa That was very nice

They return to their seats Steve watches them Everyone is
quiet Steve breaks the ice
