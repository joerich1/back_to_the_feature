head assuming the role
of Englands foremost
advocate)

She is about to plant herself on the seat when Sir

SIR WILFRID

(pressing the white

button) -
Carter I warn you if this contrap-
tion should collapse -- if the
barrister should fall off the
banister --
He is already sailing up Miss Plimsoll trotting after
him He arrives at the top of the stairs beaming

SIR WILFRID
(shouting down)
This is remarkable Carter
Smoothest flight Ive had in

years
MISS PLIMSOLL
(reaching for his
arm)
Upsy- daisy

SIR WILFRID
Just once more -- to get the feel
of the controls

10 Before she can stop him he has pressed the button and
sails down again

From the bottom of the staircase Carter is watching his
masters enjoyment of the new toy The door behind him
opens and two visitors enter the law offices They are
MR MAYHEW and man of Sir Wilfrids age a respectable
Tondon solicitor from his high collar to the tip of his
tightly rolled umbrella The other man is LEONARD VOLE
young attractive wearing a sports coat and slecks-- -
quite out of place in this stronghold of the bowler hat
the brief case and the striped pants

10A CLOSER SHOT

Mayhew is about to speak to s typist then sees Carter
He gestures to Vole to wait Vole lights a cigarette
while Meyhew walks up to Carter

MAYHEW
Good afternoon Carter Would

appointment but this is urgent

CARTER -

Wilfrid has all thet he can handle

MAYHEW

(nodding toward Vole
and lowering his voice)
-- Serious criminal matter

The typists look up at Vole eyeing him curiously
He smiles uncomfortably in return

CARTER
Absolutely not Mr Mayhew
(behing him Sir
° Wilfrid slides into
SHOT in the inclin-
ator)
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent
He cannot possibly accept anything
of an overstimleting nature

SIR WILFRID
Theyve put me on a’ diet of bland
civil suits Hello Mayhew
c

10A

MAY HEW
Hello Wilfrid This is very dis-
ressing news about your health

SIR WILFRID
Distressing Its tragic Youd

with younger arteries

MAYHEW
If you could give us just a few
minutes My client is right here
(pointing)
This is Mr Leonard Vole Hes
in rather a ghastly mess Im
afraid

‘SIR WILFRID
How do you do Mr Vole

VOLE
(with an engaging smiie)
Well according to Mr Mayhew Im
not doing at all well

For an instant Wilfrid looks at him with interest

at the top of the stairs an impatient Miss Plimsoll

claps her hands

MISS PLIMSOLL
(calling down)
Sir Wilfrid Youtre dawdling again

STR WILFRID

(right back at her)
Shut up

(to Mayhew)
Sorry Mayhew Try me again some
dsy when you have something not
too stimlat -- like a postman
bitten by a stray doge

He has pressed the button and 1s going up’ again
Suddenly 2s he is looking down at Mayhew his

attention is Grewn to something He puts the

monocie in his eye for a better view
It 1s two cigars protruding from Msyhews breast pocket

MAY HES

SIR WILFRID

Miss Plimsoll out of breath runs down the stairs and
up to Sir Wilfrid

MISS PLIMSOLL
Sir Wilfrid -- our nap

SIR WILFRID
You go shead -- start it without
me

He follows Mayhew in closing the door in her face

MISS° PLIMSOLL
This is your feult Mr Carter -- you
should not have permitted it

10A CARTER
It is not my fault
with a sha

look at Vole
I distinctly told Sir Wilfrid - no
criminal cases

VOLE
If itts anyones fault I expect its
‘mine It seems silly to me but
Mr Mayhew thinks its very urgent -
he thinks I may be srrested at any
minute

MISS PLIMSOLL
Arrested for what

VOTE’
Well -- for mrder

He smiles engagingly They stare at him trying to
reconcile his ost attractive appearance with what he
has just told them

Nh IN SIR WILFRIDS OFFICE MAY

Mayhew is seated in one of the visitor’s chairs relating
the case Sir Wilfrid is circling him like a bird dog
his eyes glued to the cigars in Mayhews pocket

MAYHEW
-- its the case of Mrs Emily French
You have probably seen the reports in
the Press She was s middle-aged
widow rather well-off living with a
housekeeper in Hampstead Mr Vole
had been with her earlier in the even-
ing When the housekeeper returned
from her dey off at eleven PM she
found her mistress dead -- struck on
the back of the head and killed

SIR WILFRID
I see wee

(he doesnt his mind
is on the cigars)

MAYHEW
Vole seems a harmless chap -- caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence -
perheps if I gave you some more of the
detalls you might suggest the strongest
line of defense --
»)

il

- é

SIR WILFRID
I could probably think better
4f you gave me one of those
cigarse

MAYHEW

Of coursee

(handing hin one)
There are naturally no previous
convictions he is a man of good
character with an excellent war
record - you would like him
LOGe

Sir Wilfrid has torn off the band bitten off the end
of the cigar and is searching frantically on his desk
and in the drawers for a match»

SIR WILFRID
(mmttering )
Theyve confiscated the matches»
Gooe (to Mayhew)
A light please give me a
light

MAYHEW
(fumbling in his
pockets)

As I see it the defense

may turn on establishing

alibi for the evening of the

murder
(no matches)

Sorry - I havent any matches-
(getting up)

Let me get somee

SIR WILFRID
(holding him back)
Lord no You dont know
Miss Piimsoll- This will take
all our cunnings
He pauses to formulate a plan then palms the clger and
opens the doore

THE ANTEROOM DAY

Sir Wilfrid stands in the doorway with a penign and
innocent expressione

yo

SIR WILFRID
(beckoning to Vole)
Young msn -- your solicitor and
I feel that you may be able to
enlighten me on a rather
important point --

VOLE
- (crossing to the door)
Yes sir Anything at ell

MISS PLIMSOLL
(desperate advancing)
Really Sir Wilfrid --

SIR WILFRID
Youre not in bed yet UPSTAIRS

He ushers in Vole then slams the door in her frustrated

face

INT SIR WILFRIDS OFFICE DAY
Sir Wilfrid turns instantly on Vole

SIR WILFRID
Give me a match

VOLE
Sorry -- I never carry them
SIR WILFRID
(crushed)
WHAT
(to Mayhew)

And you said Id like him

VOLE
Itve got a lighter
(produces it)

SIR WILFRID
(snatching the lighter)
Youre right Mayhew -- I do
like him
(gleefully as he 1s
warming the cigar on
the lighter flame)
Can you imigine Miss Plimsolls
face if she saw me now

VOLE
Letts make absolutely sure

13 He deliberately lowers the old-fashioned metal cover over
the keyhole

SIR WILFRID
(to Meyhew)
Splendid All the instincts
of s skilled criminal °

VOLE
(modes tly)
Thank you sire

They grin at each other

SIR WILFRID
Young man you may or may
not have mrdered a middle-aged
widow but you have certe
saved the life of an elderly
barrister

VOLE
I havent murdered anybody
Itts absurd But Christine -
that’s my wife - she thinks I
may be implicated and that I
needed a lawyer So I went to
see Mr Mayhew and now he thinks
thet he needs a lawyer So now
I have two lawyers Silly
isnt 1t

MAYHEW
Mr Vole I am a solicitor
Sir Wilfrid is a barrister
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court

Sir Wilfrid is completely absorbed in his cigar on
which an inch of ash has now appeared He bends back

small drawer in an old file cabinet pehind him
the ash there then closes the drawer

SIR WILFRID
(to himself with
satisfaction)
She shall not even find the
ashes
(to Vole)

Go on go on

vo
(easily)
Well I saw in the papers that
poor Mrs French had been found
dead with her head bashed in --

-and then it said in the papers

that the police were anxious to
interview me since I had visited
Mrs French that evening -- so
naturally I went along to the
police station

SIR WILFRID
(interrupting sharply)
Did they caution you

VOLE

I dont quite know I mean
they asked if I would like to
make a statement and they would
write it down and it might be
used sgainst me in Court

(with a shrug)
‘Would that be cautioning me

SIR
(with a sigh)
Oh well it cant be helped now

VOLE
Anyway they were very polite and
they seemed quite satisfied

MAYHEW -
They seemed satisfied Mr Vole
(so Sir Wilfrid)
He thinks that he made a
statement and thats the end

of it

back to Vole)
Myr Vole isnt it obvious to
you that you will be regarded
as the principal and logical
suspect in this case TI have
great fear that you will be
arrested

VOLE
Ive done nothing Why should
Ibe arrested I mean this is
England You dont get arrested
or convicted for something you
havent done
13

Pm

‘yo

SIR WILFRID
We try not to make a habit of ite

VOLE
But it does happen doesnt it
Of course There was that case
of whats-his name -- Adolph
Beck or Becker - hed been
in jail for eight years when
they found out it was another
chap entiirely - he was innocent
all along

SIR WILFRID
Very unfortunate But restitution
has been made He received s
free perdon a bounty from the
Crown snd was restored to his
normal life

VOLE
(quite agitated)
Yes that was all right for hin
But what if it had been murder
-- what if he had been hanged
-- how would they restore him
to his normal life then

MAYHEW
Really Mr Vole you mstnt
take such a morbid point of view

VOLE
(a little embarrassed)
Sorry Itts just that when
you tell me its all closing
in on me -- Its like a
nightmare

MAYHEW
Relax Mr Vole I am putting
you in the hands of the finest -
and most experienced barrister
in London --

SIR WIITFRID

Now Mayhew lets get this straighte—
I may have done something highly
unethical Ive taken your cigar
and Im not taking your case I
cantt Im forbidden My doctors
vould never allow it

(to Vole)
Im truly sorry young man

‘(and to Mayhew again)
However if you would like the case
handled by someone in these chambers
I would recommend Mr BroganMoore--
you know Brogan-Moore --

dd
(o

yy

¢

MAY HEW
Yes I do
(to Vole)
A very able man TI second
Sir Wilfrids recommendation

VOLE
(with a shrug)
If you say sO ee

Sir Wilfrid has risen and crosses to the door In passing

he shoves his cigar in Voles hand

SIR WILFRID
Hold this

He opens the door into the anteroom

THE ANTERCOM (DAY)

As Sir Wilfrid emerges Miss Plimsoll and Carter immedta tely
converge on him

SIR WILFRID
I would like to see Mr Brogan-
Moore in my office just as soon
as he comes in from Court

‘ CARTER
Yes sir

MISS PLIMSOLL

(on the verge of

breakdown)
Sir Wilfrid I have never known
such insubordination -- no not
even when I was a murse in the
front lines during the War -

SIR WILFRID

What War was thst -- the Crimean
no doubt

He slams the door in her face again

INT SIR WILFRIDS OFFICE (DAY)

As he passes Vole he takes the cigar out of Voles
outstretched hand seats himself behind the desk and
puffs on

VOLE

(with a little smile)
This morning I had no lawyers at
all -- now I suddenly have three
lewyers —

(to Mayhew)
Perhaps we ought to explain to
Sir Wilfrid thet I have very
little money --

(to Sir Wilfrid)
I wont be able to pay all the
costs and fees

SIR WILFRID
Dont worry -- wetli get a
fourth lawyer to sue you

VOLE
He wont get mich Im afraid
I havent had a job in four

months
SIR WILFRID
What sort of work do you do
VOLE

Well my last job was as a
mechanic with a motor servicing
firm The foreman kept riding
me all the time I took it as
long as I could then I quit

STR WILFRID
And before that

VOLE
I was working in 4 department
store -- in the toys demonstrating
childrens building sets Of course
that only lasted through the
Christmas rush Before that I
worked in a petrol station but
things got a little awkwardand --
I got fired

SIR WILFRID
Awkward -- in what way
(

22

VOLE
The bosss daughter She kept
annoying me until I told her
where to get off So she told
her father I was annoying her
and he tola me where to get off

SIR WILFRID
(dropping ashes in the
drawer again)
Very annoying °

‘ VOLE
Before that I had a job testing
electzic blankets --

(he catches Wilfridts

penetrating glence)
You mst be thinking Im a bit
of a arifter sir Its true in
a way but Im not really like
that Doing my Army service
unsettled me a bit That
and being abroad I was
stationed in Germany It was
fine there Thats where
I met Christine my wife She
was an ectress and a good one
Shets been a wonderful wife to
me too but I havent been mech
of a provider Im afraid --
somehow I cant seem to settle
down properly since I came back
to this country Of course if
I could just put my egg-beater

across --
SIR WILFRID
Egg-beater
VOLE
- Yes sir Im sort of an -

inventor - nothing big just
little household things A
pocket pencil sharpener a key
ring flashlight but my best

is really this egg-beater— You
see it not only beats the eggs
it also separates the yolk from
the white

SIR WILFRID
Is that really desirable

VOLE
If you were a housewife Sir
Wilfridyoutd see it right away
The trouble is I would need some
money for manufacturing and promotion-
-- wellthats really what I was
hoping Mrs French might do for me —
after I met her

SIR WILFRID
Oh Exactly how did you meet this
Mrs French

VOLE

That was rather funny in itself --
it was the third of September -- I
remember distinctly because it is

my wifes birthday - I was window-
shopping on Oxford Street sort of
daydreaming about what I would buy
for her -- if I had any money --

INSTANT CUT TO

16 EXT MILLINERY SHOP OXFORD STREET TAY

Vole strolls by the shop stops and looks at a display
of silly hats in the window He looks casually into the
shop and sees a middle-aged lady neat and prim -- MRS
EMIIY FRENCH The salesgirl is just putting a small
conservative hat on Mrs Prench She studies herself in
the mirror Suddenly she is aware that Vole is looking at
her She turns toward him Vole shakes his head in
disapproval She accepts his decision tries on a second
hat looks again toward Vole for his opinion All she
gets is a not good not bad sort of look She discards
the hat tries on a third one This is a widebrimmed
- affair quite wild She looks expectantly at-Vole He
likes this one and nods his approval She looks again
at the mirror then rushes out of the shop to talk to him

MRS FRENCH
You really like this one
‘VOLE
Very much
MRS FRENCH

You dont think its too -- too
maa
y

y

16 VOLE
Maa Not at all A little daring
perhaps -- T wouldnt recommend it

to every woman -- but you -- why

shoulant you attract some attention --
MRS FRENCH

You really’ think so

VOLE
Absolutely If I may suggest just one °
dittle thing -- lets tilt that prin
a bit to show off your face -

He does so Mrs French lets him There is the sound of 4
bus

no friends whatsoever

MAYHEW
She and her husband had lived abroad

MRS FRENCH
But this beats so quickly -- and it

bottle of sherry for me and we would
telk or play canasta or listen to
her o1d phonograph records --
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly ba

(a beat)
Its so weird tothink of her now --
laying there in that living room
murdered

SIR WILFRID
I assure you she has been moved
by now Not to have done so
would be unfeeling unlawful and
unsanitary

He has taken the drawer with the ashes out of the cabinet
opens the window and empties it into the street

MAYHEW
( to Voie)
Suppose you tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder

VOLE
I went around to see her about
eight oclock that eveningShe
fixed me a sandwich and we talked
a bit and listened to The Mikado °
I left about nine I walked home
and got there about half-past I
can prove that - I can swear to it --
in or out of courton the witness
stand anywhere--

Sir Wilfrid has been listening without looking at Vole and
polishing his monocle

SIR WILFRID
(suddenly cutting
Vole off
How much money did you get from her

VOLE
Prom whom

SIR WILFRID
From Mrs French
VOLE
Nothing Not a quid
SIR WILFRID
The truth How much
VOLE
Why should she give me any money
SIR WILFRID
Because she was in love with youl

VOLE
Thats ridiculous She liked me
She pampered me like an aunt -
but thats all I swear

SIR WILFRID
Why didnt you tell her you were
and married man

VOLE
I aid tell her

SIR WILFRID
But you never took your wife along
when you went there- did you

’ VOLE
No I didnt

SIR WILFRID
Why not

VOLE
Well because --

SIR WILFRID
Because of what

VOILE

Well Mrs French was under the
impression that Christine and I
didnt t get along too well --

SIR WILFRID
Is that true

VOLE
No We love each other

SIR WIIFRID
Then how did she get that impression
Did you give it to her

VOLE
No -- she seemed to want to believe
4t that way --

SIR WILFRID
But you never corrected tha
impression Why -

VOIE
T was afraid shed lose interest
in m

SIR WILFRID
Because she was rich

VOLE
Yes I suppose so --

’ IR WILFRID
And you were after her money

oy

- 33

VOLE
Well yes - in a way --

By this time Sir Wilfrid has put the monocle in his eye

He moves his head slightly so that the sunlight from the
window hits the monocle and is reflected directly in Voles
eyes Vole doesnt bat an eyelash as he continues his
fervent statement

VOLE °
I was hoping to get a loan for my
invention -- a couple of hundred
pounds - an honest business
proposition thats what it would
have been -- is that so wicked

SIR WILFRID
You knew it was the housekeepers
day off

VOLE
Yes I did

SIR WILFRID

So you went there because you knew
she would be alone

VOLE
No I went there because I thought
shed be lonely

STR WILFRID
All right lonely You and the
rich lonely women all alone in
that lonely house -- with the
gramophone blaring The Mikado --
perhaps you turned the volume up
to drown out her cries --

VOLE -
No When I left her she was alive

SIR WILFRID
But when the housekeeper came back
she was dead

WIE -
The house had been ransacked It
said so in the papers It mst
have been a burglar

(very em tional)

I didnt do it No matter how bad
things look I didntt do 1t You
mist believe me You do believe me
dont you

Complete silence for five seconds Then -

SIR WILFRID
(dropping the monoc le)
Of course Mr Vole If I dian t
believe you I would not have
subjected your eyes or my arteries
to that ordeal

VOLE
(exhaus ted)
Thank ‘you
SIR WILFRID

(seating himself)
As for things looking bad -- they
dontt look bad Mr Vole -- they look
terrible Apparently you have no
alibi at alll

BROGAN-MOORE

(shakes hands again)

SIR WILFRID
(instantly) -
Badly thank you There’s a mass
of circumstantial evidence no
alibi whatsoever - its s hot
potato and I’m tossing 1t right
into your lap

)

’ BROGAN-MOORE
Much obliged
SIR WILFRID

Your line of defense however will
be lack of mtive You will agree
that we can rule out a crime of
passion That leaves us with a
murder for profit Now then - if
Mr Vole had been sponging on Mrs
French why ki11 her and cut off
the source of supply Or -- if he

‘was hoping for a golden egg why

kit the goose before it was laid

No motive No motive whatsoever
(a skeptical glance from
Brogan-Moore)

You find some flaw in this line of

reasoning

BROGAN-MOORE

No Its very sound as far as it
goes

SIR WILFRID
Well its all yours Brogan-Moore

Youll find Mr Vole very responsive

and quite candid -- so candid in
fact that he has alresdy informed
me that we will have to sue him
for our fees

BROGAN-MOORE
(with a smile)
Well simply put a lien on Mr
Volets eighty thousand pounds

VOLE
Wheat eighty thousand pounds

BROGAN-MOORE

He reaches for the phone Suddenly he becomes sware of the
way Sir Wilfrid Mayhew and Brogan-Moore are looking at him
Theres a seconds silence

VOLE

(quite sober now)
This inheritance -- it doesnt
make things look any better for
me does it

SIR WILFRID
No I wouldnt think so

VOLE
So now they11 say that I did have
and motive --

SIR WILFRID
(rising and crossing

to the window)
They will indeed Eighty thousand
pounds makes for a very handsome
motive

(to Mayhew)
I thought you were crazy But Tt

VOLE

I knew nothing about that will I
didnt know Mrs French had any
intention of leaving me her money

could it be 4 motive

MAYHEW
(sympathe tically)

crosses to the door)

Vole starts out with the two ‘detectives on either side

of him Meyhew following Vole turns back in the open
doorway

the hopeless cause

She has followed Brogen-Moore to the door of Sir Wilfrids
office Stops and turns back

Is it perhaps that this cause is
too hopeless

She does not wait for an answer walks into the office

Sir Wilfrid lets the monocle fall seats himself on the
inclinator and presses the button 111 the time glaring
at the closed door of his office The inclinator rises
and Miss Plimsoll trots beside it

MISS PLIMSOLL
I shall have a very serious taik
with Dr Herrison It was a
mistake to let you come back here -
I should have taken you directly
to a rest home or to a resort --
some place quiet far off --
like Bermudas

SIR WILFRID
(his mind on
Mrs Vole)
Oh shut up You just want to
see me in those nasty shorts

The inclinator comes to a stop at the hend of the staircase
Miss Plimsoll helps Sir Wilfrid up from the seat He stands
still looking down toward his office door

MISS PLIMSOLL

sleeve)
Come now Sir Wilfrid you mst
not think of it You mst get
ready for sleep - think beautiful
thoughts -

She leads him into the bedroom

SIR WILFRIDS BEDROOM (DAY)

It is the room above his office of the same shape and
the same octagonal winiow design There is a big
Victorian bed a chaise deep comfortable chairs and

and washstand behind e folding screen As they enter Miss
Plimsoll takes a pair of pajamas from the bed and hands
them to Sir Wilfrid

- “MISS PLIMSOLL
Now put those on -- tops and
bottoms -- while I make your

‘He takes the pajamas goes behind the screen deep in

MISS PLIMSOLL
After your rest well have a nice
cup of cocoa Then perhaps well
go for 4 little walk in the square

Behina the screen Sir Wilfrid hasnt made 4 move to get into

below
MISS PLIMSOLL
(busy with the bed)
I mst sey I feel sorry for that
nice Mr Vole -- not just because
he was arrested -- but that wife
of his -- she mist be German -
I suppose thats what happens
when we let our boys cross the
channels they go crazy ---
Personally I think the Government
should do something about those
foreign wives -- like an embargo --
how else can we take care of our
own surplus -- don’t you agree
Sir Wilfrid
(the bed is ready)
All right hop in --
(no answer)

Sir Wilfria

foo late She gets a last glimpse of Sir wilrrid entering
his office

INT STR WILFRID‘S OFFICE (DAY)
Brogan-Moore is interviewing Mrs Vole He is seated

-behind the desk Mrs Vole is ina chair near the

window She is very calm and poised Sir Wilfrid enters
quietly gestures to Brogan-Mbore to contimue then moves
to a position from which he can observe Mrs Vole

CHRISTINE
Yes of course I knew that Leonard
had been seeing Mrs French quite
frequently I knew it from the day
when he came home with a pair of
green socks she had knitted for hin

BROGAN-MOORE
Well thats quite natural And
Im sure a jury will find it
rather endearing

CHRISTINE
Oh Ieonard can be very endearing
He hstes that particular shade of
green and the socks were two
sizes too smail but he wore them
just the same --just to give her
Pleasure Leonard has a way with
women I only hope he will have
an all-woman jury -- they will
carry him from the courtroom in
triumph

BROGAN-MOORE
A simple acquittal will do Now
Mrs Vole you know that Mrs
Prench left your husband money

CHRISTINE
Yes A Jot of money

BROGAN-MOORE

Of course your husband had no

previous knowledge of this
bequest

CHRISTINE
Is that what he told you
‘BROGA N-MOORE

Surely Mrs Vole you are not
suggesting anything different

CHRISTINE
Oh no I do not suggest anything

BROGAN-MDORE
Quite obviously Mrs French had
come to look upon your husband
Qands a son -- or perhaps a ad
favorite nephew

CHRISTINE
¢ You think Mrs French looked upon
Leonard as a son -- or a nephew

BROGAN-MOORE
Ido An entirely natural and
understandable relationship

CHRISTINE
What hypocrites you are in this
country
(Brogan-Moore and Sir
Wilfrid exchange a look)
I shock you I am so sorry

BROGAN-MOORE
Apparently you have a continental
way of looking at things but I
assure you it would be most umvise
to suggest that Mrs French had
any feelings for your husband
other than -- well -- er --

CHRISTINE
a Tet us say an eunt By all
( means

Suddenly a bright gleam of sunlight hits her eyes and makes
her blink

Sir Wilfrid has quietly placed himself for the monocle
test

SIR WILFRID
Pardon me Brogan-Moore
(then to
Chris tine)
Did you say that the socks Mrs
French knitted for your husband
were tWo sizes too small

CHRISTINE
- At least

SIR WILFRID
Would that not indicate that
she thought of him as a small boy
a nephew for instance

CHRISTINE
( It indicates that she did not
know how to knit
(she blinks tries to move
to avoid the light beam)
yo

yo

SIR WILFRID
(focusing the blazi
monocle relentlessly
Mrs Vole you realize that your
husbands entire defense rests on
his word and yours

CHRISTINE
I realize that

SIR WILFRID
And that the jury will be quite
skeptical by the word of a man
accused of murder when supported
only by the word of his wife

CHRISTINE
I realize that too

SIR WILFRID
Tet us then at least make sure
that the two are not in conflict

CHRISTINE
By all means let us

“ghe has been moving her head trying to avoid the glare from

Sir Wilfrids monocle Now she casually reaches for the
cord of the window shade and pulls it down a couple of
inches -- enough to cut off the sun from Sir Wilfrids
monocle

CHRISTINE
There - isnt that more
comfortable for you Sir Wilfrid

Brogan-Moore smiles slightly Sir Wilfrid his face now
in shadow presses on grimly -

SIR WILFRID
Qn-the night of the murder your
husband came home before nine-
thirty Is that correct

CHRISTINE
Yes -- I believe so

SIR WILFRID
In fact he remembers that it
vas precisely nine twenty-six
yo

yo

CHRISTINE
Nine twenty-six What makes him
so precise

SIR WILFRID
The clock -- the new invention hed
been tinkering with

CHRISTINE
Clock Oh -- oh yes and new kind
of cuckoo clock Its very clever
Teonard is quite an inventor

BROGA N-MOORE
Then it is true -- he was at home
with you at nine twenty-six

CHRISTINE
Precisely

BROGAN-MOORE
And he aid not go out again

CHRISTINE
(by rote)

pix and did not go out again
tam’ that what he wants me to

BROGAN-MOORE
Isnt it the truth

CHRISTINE
(after a long pause)
of course
Brogan-Moore and Sir
Wilfrid exchange relieved

glances
But when I told it to the police
I do not think they pelieved me
Maybe I did not say 1t vell
Maybe because of my accent

SIR WIIFRID
My dear Mrs Vole -- in our Courts
we will accept the evidence of
witnesses who speak only Bulgarian
and who must have an interpreter and
even desf-muteswho cannot speak at
all As long as they tell the truth

BROGAN-MOORE
You are aware of course that
when I put you in the witness box
you will be sworn and you will
testify under oath
)

CHRISTINE

Yes
(again by rote)

Leonard came home at precisely
nine twenty-six and did not go out
again The truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth Ts that
petter

SIR WILFRID
Mra Vole do you love your husband

CHRISTINE
Leonard thinks I do

SIR WILFRID
(angrily)
Well do you

CHRISTINE
Am I already under oath

SIR WILFRID
Mrs Vole whatever your gambit
may be do you know that under
British law you cannot be called
to give testimony damaging to your
husbsend

CHRISTINE
How very convenient

SIR WILFRID
We are dealing with a capital
crime The prosecution will try
to hang your husband

CHRISTINE
He is not my husband

Brogan-Moore and Sir Wilfrid stare at each other then

at her

There 1s a moment of shocked silence

CHRISTINE
We went through a form of marriage
in Hamburg but I had a husband
living at the time somewhere In
East Germany -- in the Russian
zone

SIR WILFRID
Did you tell leonard
CHRISTINE
It would have been stupid to tell
him He would not have married
me and I would have been left
behind to starve in the rubble

BROGAN-MOORE
So he married you and brought
you safely to this country Dont
you think you should be very grateful
to him

CHRISTINE
One can get very tired of gratitude

STR WILFRID
Your husband loves you very much
does he not

CHRISTINE
Leonard He worships the ground
I walk on

SIR WILFRID
And you

CHRISTINE
You want to know too much
(she rises and puts
up the window shade)
Auf wiedersehen gentlemen

She crosses quickly toward the door

SIR WILFRID
(acidly)
Thank you for coming in Mrs
Vole Your visit has been most
reassuring

CHRISTINE

(in the doorway)
Do not worry Sir Wilfrid I
shall give him an alibi I will
be very convincing There will
be tears in my eyes when I say --
Leonard came home at nine twenty-
six -- precisely I may even
bring the cuckoo - as an additional
witness —s
SIR WILFRID
Youre a very remarkable woman
Mra Vole

(

CHRISTINE
And you are satisfied I hope

She exits

SIR WILFRID
Im dammed if Im satisfied

BROGAN-MOORE

Care to join me in a whiff of
those smelling salts
(Sir Wilfrid doesnt
answer welks -
to the window)

SIR WILFRID
That woman is up to something -
but what
BROGAN-MOORE

The Prosecution will break her
down in no time when I put her
in the witness box

(while Sir Wilfrid is

looking out the window)
You know defending this case is
going to be rether like The

arge of the Light Brigade

or one of those Japanese suicide
pilots - quite one-sided with
the odds all on the other side
I havent got much to go on
with have I The fact is
Ive got notning

Sir Wilfrid turns from the window

SIR WILFRID
Tet me ask you something -- do
you believe Leonard Vole is
- Innocent
(no answer from
Brogan-Moore)
Do you

He has put the monocle in his eye ‘The beam of light
hits Brogan-Moore squarely in the face

(turning avay)
Im not sure -- Im sorry
Wilfrid -- Of course Ill do
my best --

SIR WILFRID
Its all right Brogan-Moore --

He whips out the second cigar taken from Mayhew bits off

Miss Plimsoll enters

EXT BOMBED-OUT STREET IN HAMBURG ( NIGHT)

The street is wet from rain Flight Sgt Leonard Vole
in Royal Air Force uniform a small kit-bag slung over
his shoulder comes down the street He stops in the
cellar doorwey of one of the bombed-out buildings A
sign over the door with a Dive lantern attached reads
DIE BIAUE IATERNE Next to the door is a provocative
poster of an entertainer exhibithg her remarkable
gartered legs Across the poster is printed

CHRISTINE HELM Music from a small band drifts from

the shabby cellar cabaret and Christine is heard singing

It is one of those fly-by-night cabarets which spring
up in the rubble to attract servicemen

Vole glances at the poster then goes down the shattered
steps leading into the night club

- INT NIGHT CLUB (NIGHT)

Vole enters the dark smoke-filled room and looks around

It is a small claustrophobic catacomb with odds and ends
holding the crumbling wells together It is packed with
British military personnel The air is hot and thick
with pent-up animal expectancy

On an ersatz stage an emaciated four-piece German band
is accompanying Christine She wears and German sailors
outfit with pants She sings AUF DER REEPERBAHN and
accompanies herself on 6 small accordion

-Vole crosses to the bar where it is already three-deep
buys himself a schnapps and watches Christine

Christine starts the second chorus She steps down
from the stage As she plays and sings she moves
alluringly between the densely crowded tables brushing
against the eager alcholized customers A rickety
spotlight operated by one of the waiters follows her

There are scattered catcalls and whistles of disappointment
over Christines costume as she is moving among them

He holds her bends down and rips one trouser-leg open
exposing her leg above the knee the stocking and the
fancy garter She kicks him Another soldier grabs
her and rips the other trouser-leg The stampede is on

The men packed around the bar also surge forward to get
aoe ety melee leaving Vole alone sipping his schnapps
etly

Christine is fighting back kicking at those in reach
hitting at others with her accordion The musicians
too are in on the scrimmage as are the waiters sil
trying to protect her From OFF come sirens shrill
whistles and screeching of brakes

A dozen British MPs come surging in past Vole at

large military trucks parked outside The First Drunken
Soldier is being hustled onto the truck by an MP He
makes a last stand grabbing his captors trousermleg

The MP clunks him on the head with his night stick
then heaves him onto the truck

night club an MP officer plasters an Out of Bounds
sign smack over Christine Helms center section Catcalls
and hoots from the truck On target sir -- Bulls-eye

The Lieutenant gets into the front seat of the lead truck
and both drive off the soldiers hooting and shouting
The street is deserted again

®o the right of the night club is a completely shattered
building All that is standing is a door The door
opens and Leonard Vole comes out blithely carefully
closing the door again Without any hesitation he goes
to the night club For a second he stops at the poster
fhe OFF LIMITS sign has come loose at one corner He
presses it down smoothing it out then goes down the
steps just as the disheveled msicians are coming out
with their instruments

INT NIGHT CLUB (wieHT)

As Vole reenters the waiters’ are trying to clean up

the meas of overturned tables chairs and broken glasses
Through the overturned furniture he sees Christine her
trouser-legs torn crawling about looking for something

ko INT COURTROOM WO 1 (DAY)

Myers is standing examining Inspector Hearne ‘The packed
courtroom is following the testimony closely

HEARNE °
eee from the body temperature
and other factors we placed the
time of death at between nine-
thirty and ten pm approximately
thirty mimtes before Janet MacKenzie
the housekeeper returned home and -
called us

MYERS
In what position did you find the
- poay of Mrs Frenzh

HEARNE
She was lying on her face with
a severe injury to the back of her

head
a Vole in the Dock 1s listening gloomily He looks up
and smiles because he sees that Sir Wilfrid and Carter

have entered and are proceeding to their seats Sir Wilfrid
is carrying the thermos bottle under his gown The
interrogation proceeds over this

Weer ee tele

ha MYERS
Was thot injury the cause of death
Inspector
HEARNE

Yes sir Death was instantaneous
caused by one blow from a heavy and
blunt instrument

Sir Wilfrid still unnoticed by anyone but Vole is making
his way to the Bar Carter to the place reserved for him

MYERS
Were there any other signs of a
struggle

HEARNE
None Just the one blow

MYERS
One blow Would that indicate to
you that the mrderer had taken
Mrs French by surprise

Sir Wilfrid is just about to sit down straightens up sharply

° SIR WILFRID
My Iord I mst object -«°

(the Judge Myers others

are now aware of him)
-- my learned friend refers to
the assailant as the murderer
but we have not yet determined
whether the assailant was a man -
or awoman It could quite
conceivably have been the

mirderess
JUDGE
Mr Myers it seems that Sir ™

Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of
grammar Please rephrase your
ques tion

Sir Wilfrid with a little smile at Hearne sits down

MWERS

Yes my lord —

(to Hearne)
Inspector 1s it your opinion that
the assailant --

(glaring at Sir Wilfrid)
- whether he she or it - took
Mrs French by surprise

‘

T5s

ho «Sir Wilfrid is about to put the thermos
bottle under the seat but rises quickly again

SIR WILFRID
My lord I am taken by surprise
that my learned colleague should
attempt to solicit from the witness
an opinion and not a fact

JUIGE - °
Quite so Youtll have to do better
than that Mr Myers

MYERS
- (resigned)
My lord I withdraw the question
entirely

SIR WILFRID
Thats mech better
The sits and puts the
thermos under his seat)

In the crowded gallery Miss Plimsoll squeezes
herself into a vacant seat next to a young blonde
woman whose attention 1s riveted on Vole in the Dock
Miss Plimsoll sets her alarm wristwatch and settles
ck

‘Below the examination has contimued

MWWERS
Very well Inspector let us
proceed with the facts in the
case After establishing the
cause and the time of death
what did you then do

HEARNE
A search was made photographs
were taken and the premises were
fingerprinted

MYERS
What fingerprints did you discover

HEARNE
I found the fingerprints of Mrs°
French those of Janet MacKenzie
and some which later proved to
be those of Leonard Vole

MYERS
No others

HEARNE
No others

Vole takes his hands from the rail of the Bock and moves
uneasily in his seat at this revelation

MYERS
Now did you say that the room
had the appearance that a robbery
had been committed

HEARNE

Yes Things were strewn about

and a window had been broken near
the catch There was glass on the
floor and fragments were found
outside The glass outside was

not consistent with the window
having been forced from the outside

MYERS
Wheat you are saying is that
someone attempted to make 1t look
as though the window had been forced
from the outside isnt that so

SIR WILFRID
‘(ris

ing
My lord I mst object My learned
friend is putting words in the
witness mouth After all if he
insists on answering his own
questions the presence of the
witness seems superfluous

JUDGE
Quite quite Dont you think
80 Mr Myers

MZERS
( sourly)
Yes my lord
(to Hearne)
Inspector did you escertain
whether any of the mirdered
vyomans property was missing

HEARNE
According to the housekeeper
nothing was missing

MVERS
In your experience Inspector
when burglars --

with a glance at Sir Wilfrid) -
-- or burglsresses --break into a house
do they leave without taking anything
he

TT

HEARNE
No sir

MYERS
Do you produce a jacket Inspector

HEARNE
Yes sir

An Usher crosses to the table on which the exhibits are
put out --a jacket 1 knife the will and assorted other
papers The Usher picks up the jacket and takes it to

the Inspector

MWWERS
Is that the jacket

HEARNE
Yes sir
as the Usher replaces
the jacket)

MYERS
I propose that this be tagged
Exhibit One
(then to Hearne)
Where did you find this Inspector

HEARNE
That is the jacket found in the
prisoners flat which I handed
to our lab to test for bloods tains

MWWERS
And did you find bloodstains
HEARNE
Yes though an attempt hed been
made to wash them out
Sir Wilfrid seemingly disinterested in the Interrogation
twirls his monocle around his finger

MYERS
What tests did the laboratory
make Inspector

HEARNE
First to determine if the stains
were made by human blood then to
classify it by group or type

MYERS
And was the blood of a particular
group or type

° HEARNE
Yes sir It is Type 0

MYERS
And did you subsequently test the
blood of the dead woman

HEARNE
Yes sir -

MYERS
And what type was that

HEARNE
The same --- Type 0

MYERS
Thank you Inspector

Vole in the Dock hears the excited murmur from the
Courtroom He’ glances anxiously at the Judge who is
writing 2 note then at the Jury whose expressions
indicate that the Prosecution has scored He looks at
Brogan-Moore preparing some papers and at Sir Wilfrid
who is impassively twirling his monocle ‘
MWERS
No further ques tions

He sits down complacently ‘There is a moments pause
Sir Wilfrid carefully puts the monocle in his eye rises

SIR WILFRID
You say that the only fingerprints -
you found were those of Mrs
Janet MacKenzie and the prisoner
Leonard Vole In your expertence
when a burglar breaks in does he
usually leave fingerprints
or does he wear gloves

HEARNE
He wears gloves
STR WILFRID —
Invariably
HEARNE

Almost invarlably

SIR WILFRID
So the absence of fingerprints
in a case of robbery would hardly
surprise you
he

HEARNE
No sir

SIR WILFRID
Cant we then surmise that a burglar
might have-entered what was presumably
an empty house might have suddenly
encountered Mrs French and struck
her «- then realizing that she was
dead panicked and fled without
taking anything

HEARNE
Yes sir -- that is certainly
possible

(rising)
I submit my lord thet it is
entirely impossible to guess
what went on in the mind of some
entirely imaginary burglar -- with
or without gloves

‘ JUDGE
Quite right Mr ae
(so Wilfrid
Tet us not surmise Sir Wiifrid
Dut confine ourselves to facts

SIR WILFRID
nods -- then to
Hearne)

Inspector when you questioned the
prisoner as to the stains on his
jacket aid he not show you 4
recently healed scar on his wrist
and tell you he had cut

himself with a kitchen knife
while slicing bread

HEARNE
Yes sir that is what he said
SIR WILFRID
Anda were you not told the same
thing by the prisoners wife

° HEARNE
Yes sir but afterwards --
42

SIR WILFRID ©
(sharply) —

A simple yes or no please

Dida the prisoners wife show

you a knife and tell you that

her husband had cut his wrist

while slicing bread

HEARNE
Yes sir

SIR WILFRID
I will ask you to examine this
xnife Inspector

Usher crosses to table picks up knife with tag on it
and brings it to Hearne

SIR WIIFRID
Just test the edge of the knife
with your finger --
(Hearne does so)

-- carefoiiyt
arne pulls his

finger away)
You agree that the point and the
cutting edge are razor sharp

HEARNE
Yes Sir
(nands knife back to
the Usher)

SIR WILFRID
Now then if such a knife were to
‘slip might it not inflict a cut which
would bleed profusely

HEARNE
Yes sir -- it might

SIR WILFRID
Now Inspector you have stated that
the bloodsteains on the prisoners
jacket were analyzed 45 was the
blood of Mrs French and they were
both found to be of the same group -
Group 0

HEARNE
That is correct

(7

7 SIR WILFRID
However if the prisoners blood
were also of this same group then the
stains on his jacket might very well
have resulted from the household
accident he described to you

HEARNE
Yes sir

SIR WILFRID
Did you analyze the prisecners
ood Inspector

HEARNE
No sir

SIR WILFRID

I have here a certificate --

(Brogan-Moore extends

it to him)
-- stating that Leonard Stephen
Vole is a blood donor at the
North London Hospital and that
his blood ts --

(emphatically)
Group - 0

A buzz in the courtroom Vole relieved wipes some
perspiration from his upper ‘lip

SIR WILPRID
Thank you Inspector
(he sits)

MYERS

(trying to recover

lost
Inspector granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that
knife is there anything to show
whether it was an accident or
done deliberately after the murder --
to account for the biood-s teins

SIR

Janet enters Courtroom carrying beg and umbrella her
tight-lipped face cold and expressionless As she passes
the Dock she glares at Vole and contimes-on to the stand
Usher hands her Bible and holds oath card Janet starts
to recite the oath

In the Gellery Miss Plimsoll is watching the proceedings
Her alarm wristwatch goes off suddenly and she quickly
stifles the buzzer She looks apologetically at the blonde
in the next seat then leans forward attracting the
attention of Carter below

Carter catches her eye nods signals to Mayhew Mayhew
signals to Brogan-Moore who leans close to Sir Wilfrid
whispering something Sir Wilfrid has been twirling his
monocie on its cord He nods takes out the white pill
box from which he removesone pill Srogan-Moore lifts
out the thermos bottle unscrews the cap and fills it
handing it to Sir Wilfrid Wilfrid looks up at Miss
Plimsoll who nods spprovingly as he puts the pill in
his mouth ‘Then he swirls the liquid in the cup as in
a snifter inhales the aroma and swallows the contents
appreciatively

In the Gallery Miss Plimsoll is setting her alarm watch
again and whispers to her blonde neighbor

MISS PLIMSOLL
I dont think he could get
through the trial if he didnt
have his medicine every hour

During all this Janet MacKenzie has been sworn and we have
heard the first of the questioning
MYERS
Your name is Janet MacKenzie

JANET
Aye thats my name

MYERS
Where do you live
a

he

JANET
(turning to the Judge) —
Now that Mrs French poor soul
is dead Ive moved in with ny
niece at 19 Glenister Place

JUIGE
Miss MacKenzie would you please
speak into the microphone

MYERS
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French

JANET
I was her housekeeper Ive no
opinion of companions poor
feckless bodies afraid to do a
bit of honest domestic work

MYERS
Quite What I meant was that
you were on friendly terms -
not altogether those of a mistress
and a servant

JANET
fen years I was with her and
looked after her ‘She knew me
and she trusted me and manys
the time I prevented her doing
a foolish thing

MYERS
Please tell us in your own words
about the events of the evening
of September 14th

JANET

it was Friday end my night out
I wes going round to see my niece
in Glenister Road which is about
five mimites walk I left the house
at half-past seven Id promised to
bring her a dress pattern that shetd-
admired

(the microphone looming

before her makes her

nervous to the

Judge)
Is this thing necessary

y

(7

‘oe

he

JUDGE

An excellent question However

it has been installed at considerable
expense to the taxpayers so let us
take advantage of it Please contime

JANET

Well when I got to my nieces I
found Id left the pattern behind so
after supper I slipped back to get it
as it was no distance I got back
to the house at twenty-five mimtes
past nine I let myself in and
went upstairs to my room

(glances at Vole)
As I passed the sitting-room I
heard the prisoner in there
talking to Mrs French

VOLE
( jumping up)
No It wasnt me It wasnt
my voice

MYERS
Youre sure it was the 1
prisoners voice you heard

JANET
Aye I know his voice well enough --
with him calling so often Talking
and leughing they were but it was
no business of mine so I went up
stairs and fetched my pattern

MYERS
Tet us be very exact about the time
You say that you reentered the
house at twenty-five past nine

JANET
Aye The pattern was on a shelf in
my room right next to my clock and
I saw the time Twenty-five past nine

Go on please

JANET
I went back to my niece She was de-
lighted with the pattern --
(she has turned to the
Judge who waves her back
toward the microphone)
(conta)

84

The warders restrain him He sinks back in his chair

JANET (contd )
-- simply delighted I stayed there
until twenty eleven then came
home I went into the sitting-room
to see if the mistress wanted anything
and there she was dead with every-
thing tossed hither and thither
MYERS od
Did you really think that a burglary
had occurred

Sir Wilfrid is stiil doodling with his pills but at this
question he leaps to his feet

SIR WILFRID
My lord I mst protest

(sternly)
I will not allow that question to be
answered Mr Myers

MYERS
Mt lord
(to Janet)
How much did you know about the
prisoner

JANET
I knew that he needed money

MYERS
Did you ever hear him ask Mrs
Prench for money

JANET
He was too clever for that

MYERS ™
Were you aware Miss MacKenzie
thet Leonard Vole was a married
man’

JANET
No indeed Neither was the
mistress

VOLE
(he 1s again restrained)

STR WILFRID
(rising)
MYlord I mist object What Mrs
French knew or did not know is pure ©
conjécture on Janet MacKenzies part

Janet
he

MYERS
Let me put it this way -
(Wilfrid sits
You formed the opinion
that Mrs French thought Leonard
Vole a single man Have you any
facts to support that opinion

JANET
There was the books she ordered
The Life of Baroness Burdett
Couts and one about Disraeli and his
wife Both of them about women whola
married men years younger than
themselves I knew what she was
thinking

JUDGE
Im afraid we cannot admit that

JANET
(bristling)

Why

JULGE
Members of the Jury it is possible
for a woman to read the Life of
Disraeli without contemplating
marriage with a man younger than
herself

WERS
(after laugher has
subsided)

Miss MacKenzie - were you aware
of what arrangements Mrs French
hed made for the disposal of her
money

JANET
Yes she had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up TI heard
her calling her solicitor Mr
Stokes He was there too the
prisoner I mean

MYERS
You heard the prisoner and Mrs
French discussing her new will

JANET
Aye He was to have all her
money she told him as she
had no near relatives nor
anybody who meant to her what
he did

re

he MYERS
And when did this take place

JANET
On September 8th one week to the
day before she was mirdered

fy

MYERS
Thank you
(turning slightly a
to Sir Wilfrid)
That concludes ny examination

‘Janet rises is about to leave the box but Sir Wilfria
stops her

SIR WILFRID
(quietly)
Not just yet Miss MacKenzie

She gives him an angry look and resumes her place in
the box

SIR WILFRID
(monocle in eye)

Miss MacKenzie you have given
testimony about two wills
in the old will the will
that was revoked were you
not to receive the bulk of
Mrs Frenchs estate

JANET
Aye ‘That is so
SIR WILFRID
Whereas in the new will except
for a bequest to you of a small
annuity the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner Leonard Vole
JANET
It will be a wicked injustice if
he ever touches a penny of that
money
SIR WILFRID
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the
prisoner

JANET
Im not antagonistic to him Hes
a shiftless scheming rascal - but
Im not antagonistic to him
SIR WILFRID
I suggest that you have formed
this opinion because his friendship
with your mistress cost you the bulk
of her estate

JANET
I never liked him

- SIR WILFRID
Your candour is refreshing Now
on the night of September 14th
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together
What aid you hear them say

JANET
I didnt hear what they actually said

SIR WILFRID
You mean you only heard the voices --
the mrmyr of voices

JANET
They were laughing
STR

WIIFRID
What makes you say the mans voice
was Ieonard Vo-e

JANET
I know his voice well enough

SIR WILFRID

The door was closed was it not
JANET

Yes
SIR WILFRID

You were no doubt in a hurry to
get the pattern so you probably
walked quickly past the closed
door -— yet you are sure that
you heard Leonard Voles voice

JANET
I was there long enough to hear
what I heard

SIR WILFRID
Come Miss MacKenzie Im sure

you dont wish to suggest to the
Jury that you were eavesdropping
A Be

89

JANET
I know it was him in there with
her Who else could it have been

SIR WILFRID
Exactly What you mean is you
wanted it -to be him Thats the
way your mind worked Now tell
me did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening °

JANET
Aye She was fond of a talk or
and good play

SIR WILFRID

Wasnt it possible that on the
evening when you returned home
and passed the door that what
you really heard was the television
and a man and womans voices and
laughter

(to the Jury)
There was a play called Ioverts
Ieap on the television that night

toe - JANET
It was not the television

SIR WILFRID
Oh Why not

JANET
Because 1¢ was away being repaired
at week

laughter in the Courtroom the Jurors joining in ‘The
Judge with a smile is making a note

Meyhew and Brogan-Moore exchange a worried glance Sir
Wilfrid reaches for his cocoa unscrews the cup and
pours guiping it like a man who needs the restorative

In the Gallery Miss Plimsoll has seen Wilfrid take the
cocoa She looks at her watch puzzled

MISS PLIMSOLL
(to her blonde
neighbor)
Odd -- its not time yet

Sir Wilfrid catching her look quickly takes a pill from

the white box and swallows it with an innocent grin

SIR WILFRID
Mrs Vole -- or Mrs Helm -- which

do you prefer to be called

CHRISTINE

It does not mstter
SIR WILFRID

Does it not In this country
we are inclined to teke a rather
more serious view of marriage
However - Frau Helm it would
appear that when you first met
the prisoner in Hamburg you lied
to him about your marital status

CHRISTINE
XI wanted to get out of Germany SO ---

SIR WILFRID
You lied did you not Just yes
or no® please

CHRISTINE
Yes

SIR WILFRID
Thank you And subsequently in
arranging the marriage you lied
to the authorities

CHRISTINE
I did not tell the truth to the

authorities
SIR WILFRID

You lied to them
CHRISTINE

Yes
SIR WILFRID

And in the ceremony of marriage
itself when you swore to love
and to honor and to cherish your
husband that too was a lie

CHRISTINE
Yes

SIR WILFRID
And then -- when the police questioned
you about this wretched man who believed
hinself married and loved you told
em
(

he

CHRISTINE
I told them what Leonard wanted
me to say --

SIR WILFRID
You told them that he was at
home with you at twenty-five
minutes past nine -- and now you
say that that was 4 lie

CHRISTINE
Yes A lie

SIR WILFRID
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist again
you lied
CHRISTINE
Yes
SIR WILFRID
Now today you have told us 4 new
story entirely The question is
Prau Helm were you lying then —
are you lying now or are you not
in fact chronic and habitual

MYERS

My lord is my learned colleague
to be allowed to bully and insult
the witness in this fashion

Ez
Mr Myers this 1s a capital charge
and within the bounds of reason t
would like the Defense to have every
latitude

SIR WILFRID

(violently despite

his spasm
My lord may I also remind ny
learned friend that his witness
by her own admission hes already
violated sO meny oaths that I am
surprised the Testament did not
leap from her hand when she was
sworn here today

to Christine)

gained by questioning you any
further That will be ail

the meaning of the English word

(glancing at a note)
In German the word is Meineid

CHRISTINE
Yes - Meineid -- it means to
swear falsely under oath

MYERS
And are you aware Mrs Helm
that in this country the penalty
for perjury is a heavy term of
imprisonment

CHRISTINE
Yes I am aware

MZERS

Mindful of this Mrs Helm TI

evidence you have given the truth

the truth

JUDGE
Sir Wilfrid are you ready for
the Defense

SIR WILFRID
(rising with some
‘atrficulty)
My lord members of the gury the
Prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner Leonard Vole
a case of the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence Among the
witnesses you have heard Chief
Inspector Hearne who has given his
testimony in a fair and impartial
manner -— as he always does in these
cases He has evolved and put
before you a clever theory of
how this crime was committed
Whether it is theory or actual
fact however you will decide for
Yourselves Then - you have hea
e evidence of Janet MacKenzie
a worthy and devoted housekeeper
who has suffered two most grievous
losses One the death of her beloved
‘mistress -- and second in being deprived
of an inheritance of 80000 pounds which
she had fully expected to receive I wiil
not comment Turther on her evidence
(cont a)
h2

SIR WILFRID ( CONTD)
- put will express only my
deepest sympathy for her in
Doth these mishaps

And finally -- most damaging of
all - the Prosecution has produced
8 surprise witness one Chris tine
Heim --whom the prisoner married
and brought from the rubble of her
homeland to the safety of this
country giving her his love and
the protection of his name I
objected to her testimony beceuse

a wife cannot give evidence harmful
to her husband but it hes been
proven that her marriage to Leonard
Vole was fraudulent end bigamous
Therefore her evidence mus e
admitted and you mst consider

4t for what it is worth

Such is the Prosecutionts case
Now it 1s the turn of the Defense
We covld present on behalf of
the prisoner a variety of
witnesses to his character his
war record the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past
However only one witness can
shed new light on this tragic
riddle -- the prisoner himself
Members of the Jury Tt call
Ieonard Stephen Volei

Te entire Courtroom is intent on Vole as he raises his
head gets up slowly leaves the Dock and proceeds to
the Witness Box followed by the Warder who stops and

’ gtands near the Barristers door

The Usher hands him the Book and holds up the oath card

VOLE
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence Ishall give will be the
truth the whole truth and nothing
put the truth

Have you in fact concluded
your examination o ep oner
Sir Wilfrid

SIR WILFRID

(half rising)
My lord the prisoner hes endured
three days of the most profound
mental sgony and shock ‘The
Defense feels that his faculties
should be spared for the cross-
examination by my learned friend
for the Prosecution This is
nota plea for any indulgence -
YT am conrident that no matter how

- searching this may be the

prisoner will withstand it

(he sits)

MWERS

(wading in on Vole)
Mr Vole at the time that you
made the acquaintance of Mrs
Prench were you employed

VOLE
No sir

MYERS
How much money did you have
VOLE
Only a few pounds
MWERS
Did she ever give you any money
VOLE -
No not a penny °
MYERS
Did you expect to receive any
VOLE

No sir

MYERS
Did you know that in her new
will you were the beneficiary
to the extent of 80000 pounds

VOLE
No

MYERS
Now Mr Vole when you went to
visit Mes French for the last
time cid you wear a trench
coat and a brown hat

VOLE
Yes I did

Myers has produced from a file a small poster about 7 x
11 featuring e photograph of Vole in trench coat and
hat with an inscription below in small black capitals
Will any person who saw this man on the evening of

September 14th last between 900 and 930 PM kindly

commmnicate with Leslie Mayhew Solicitor of 15 Cork
Street London W1 Telephone Gerrard 0909

MYERS
(holding up poster)
Was it this coat and hat

VOTE
Yes
an

a2

before

MYERS -
My lord the Defense leaving no

gtone unturned in its efforts to

establish an alibi for the prisoner
circulated this photograph hoping
to bring forth a witness who had

geen him leaving Mrs Prenchs

house or entering his own at the’
times he has stated Apparently
this splendid effort was without
results However the Defense
will be pleased to learn that
at the last moment a witness has
come forvard and that the
prisoner had been seen wearing
this coat and this hat
(reactions from Vole
and from Sir Wilfrid
and his associates)
Lamentably he had not been
seen on the night of the
murder but exactly one week

sharply
to Vole

On the afternoon of September 8th
were you or were you not ins
travel agency in Regent Street
inquiring about prices and
sohedules of foreign cruises

VOLE
(ins tantly)
Supposing I did ‘Thats not a
crime is it

MWERS
Not at all Many people go for

a craise -when they can pay for it
But you couldnt pay for 1b could

you Mr Vole
VOLE
Iwas hard up I told you so

MYERS
And yet you came into this
particular travel agency --
with ablonde -- a honey bionde
I understand --

Her blonde neighbor is biting her lip

MISS PLIMSOLL
(locking at the Judge)
Quite a sense of humor
Wouldnt strike him so funny
if he were in the Dock

Below the Courtroom has settled down again

MZERS

(not letting Vole

off the hook)
You then admit that you made
inquiries about the most
expensive and luxurious
cruises How did you expect
to pay for such a thing

VOLE
I dont know it was --

MYERS
If you dont know -- perhaps T
can help you On the morning of
the ve same de according to
Mr Stakes you tara Mrs French
change her will leaving you the
bulk of her money --

VOLE
I didnt I knew nothing about
the willl
MT ERS
- and in the afternoon you
started making plans to dispese
of the money
Ju

he

VOLE
No It was nothing of the kind
Twas in a pub and I met this
girl -- I dont even know her
name -- we had a couple of drinks
and then we walked out together --
we passed thet display window with
fancy posters with blue seas and
palm trees -- the Grecian Islands
or some plece -- so we went in --
just for the fun of Lt -- and we
asked for some folders The man
gave me sort of a funny look --
because I looked a bit shabby --
and it irritated me so I kept
asking for the swankiest tours --
all de luxe and a cabin on the boat
deck -- just putting on an act --

MYERS
An act No not an act -- you
knew that in a week you were
‘going to inherit 80000 pounds

VOLE
No it was nothing like that

It was make-velieve and childish--
but it was fun and I enjoyed

it I wasnt thinking of

killing anybody or inhert

Baby money

MYERS
It was just remerkable coincidence
that Mrs French should be
killed only a week later

VOLE
Ive told you - I didnt kill her

MYERS
Can you suggest any reason why
the witness Christine Heln
should deliberately give the
evidence she has given if it
were not true

VOLE
(starting to break)
No I dont I dont know why
my wife - I dontt even know why
I still call her my wife «-she
mist be lying or out of her mind

dVOe
ke

MYERS
She seemed remarkably sane and
gelf-possessed But insanity is
the only reason you can suggest

VOLE
I dont understand it
- (tértured)
Oh God whats happened - whats
changed her

MYERS
very effective Itm gure But
4n this Court we deal with fact
And the fact is Mr Vole that
we have only your word for it
that you left Emily Frenchs
house at the time you say you
aid and that you arrived home
at five and twenty minutes past
nine and that you did not go
out again

VOLE
(wildly)
Someone mst have seen me - in
the street -
(to Jury)
- or going into the house

MYERS
One would certainly think so
put the only person who aid
see you come home that night says
it was at ten minutes past ten
And she ssys that you had blood

on your clothes

VOLE
(throws arm out)
I cut my wrist

MYERS
You cut your wrist deliberately

VOLE
No I didnt I didnt do
anything but you make it
sound as though i did
(hand to head)
I can near it myself

give your attendance God save The
Queen

During this Vole standing in the Deck sees that Sir
Wilfrids plece at the Ber is vacant He looks around
nervously for his counsel Meyhew too is missing

The Judge bows to the Court and sits everyone following

JUDGE
Since the Defense has called tut one
witness -- the prisoner -- it has the
right to be heard last in summation
Therefore Mr Myers if you are ready
let us heve the final address for the
Prosecution

Myers rises adjusts his robe and wig with the air of a
man contemplating imminent certain triumph
MYERS

My lord -—- members of the jury -- I
shall be brief in my final speech be-
cause I think the Prosecution has
proved so obvious a case of murder
against the prisoner Leonard Vcle
that a verdict of guilty seems to be
the only possible conclusion I will
briefly summarize these facts ---

There is the sound of commotion near the Berristers
Entrance and heads turn Sir Wilfrid bustles into the
Courtroom sti11 pulling his robe about him and adjusting
his wig Meyhew is close behind
nad
47 Vole in the Dock has been listening hleakly to Myers
opening but now looks up eagerly as Sir Wilfrid and
Mayhew make their way to the Zar

JUDGE
Youd better begin again Mr Myers --
that is 1f Sir Wilfrid is at all
interested in our proceedings

SIR WILFRID a
(making his way to his
seat)
I em indeed my lord The summetion
for the Crown however is premature ---
I ask thet the case for the defense be
reopened and that a witness be recalled

There is a reaction in the Courtroom Vole looks at
Sir Wilfrid with a new glint ef hope Brogan-Moore is
puzzled by this approach

MYERS
My lord I must strenuously otject
to the reopening cf a case which
the Prosecution regards as clozed

SIR WILFRID
Evidence of the most startling nature
has come into my possession only last
night ---

MYERS
My lord the course my learned
friend preposes is quite unprecedented

SIR WILFRID

I have anticipated my friends
otjection and I am prepared to meet
it with ample precedent There is
first the case of The Crown against
Stillman -- which was reported at

(by rote)
page 463 of the 1926 Appeal Cases --
also the Crown against Porter August
11 1930 reported at the Winchester
Assizes at pege 231 and before the
Divisional Court the following October
reported at page 153 of 1942 Kings Bench
Division Further the case of the
King against Sullivan in which this
issue wes raised end I am sure your
lordship will remember since he
appeared for the Prosecution

JUDGE
I did
(catching himself)
Oh yes Before Mr Justice Swindon

Now what is thls new evidence Sir

Wilfrid

cs SIR WILFRID
Letters my lord Written by Christine
Helm

There is a sharp reaction from Vole Sir Wilfrid has
given the letters to an Usher who takes them to the
Judge As the Judge inspects the letters --

- MYERS
My lord the Prosecution contimes
its objection if my memory serves
me well your Lordships similar
objection -- in the King against
Sullivan -- was sustained

JUDGE
Your memery for once serves you ill
Mr Myers My objection was over-
ruled by Mr Justice Swindon -- as

yours is now by met

He hands the packet of blue letters to the Usher who
carries them back to Sir Wlifrid

SIR WILFRID

(his voice ringing)
Call Christine Helm

The call is repeated by the Usher and Policeman at the
door Christine enters her customary impassive self

proceeding to the Witness Box Vole stares at her blankly
then he tries to catch Sir Wilfrids eye as if hoping

for a clue to the proceedings Sir Wilfrid gives him an

encouraging nod
SIR WILFRID

(turning to Brogan-Moore)

If you still have any doubts about

Leonard Voie I wouldnt mind

betting you a very small box of

cigars

letter)

CHRISTINE

series written to the same man --

CHRISTINE
Lies ---- all lies

SIR WILFRID
You would seem to have been on -- let
us say on intimate terms with this
man

In the dock Vole rises outraged

VOLE
How dare you say a thing like that --
resisting the Warder)
It isnt true

JUDGE
The prisoner in his own interest
will remain silent

Meyhew gestures to Vole to sit down and he does so urged
by the Warders

SIR WILFRID
I am not concerned with the general
trend of this correspondence --
(unfolding the letter)

-- only in one particular letter
(glancing down as if
reading

My beloved Mex An extraordinary

thing has happened TI believe all

I will not stand here and listen to a

The Jury is filing back into its seatse There is 4 hush
of expectation

Leonard Vole nerves strained to the breaking point is
in the Dock His eyes anxiously scan the Jurors as if
to try to guess their verdict Then his gaze wanders
toward Sir Wilfrid and Brogan-Moore just seating them--
selves Sir Wilfrid leaning forward does not meet his
eyese He looks past the Dock toward --

The glass-panelled door leading into the Courtroom The
Courtroom Officer stands on guarde The door opening
inward 1g pushed just slightly open and through the
aperature we see Christine tensely awaiting the verdict

In the Gallery the spectators are silent motioniess in
taut anticipation of the result Among them is Miss

are moist and he automatically rubs them against his coat

FOREMAN

‘Excitement breaks loose There is a burst of applause

and some cheers

Vole sits down abruptly exhausted His eyes close
tightly for a moments —

In the Gallery where all the spectators including Miss
Plimsoll are cheering and applauding her brunette
neighbor is weeping-

Myers turns toward Sir Wilfrid and makes a gallant gesture
of salute in defeat Sir Wilfrid leaning forward doss
not see Myers but Brogan-Hoore nudges him He turns
toward Myers with a casual gesture of acknowledgment
then turns back toward the glass-panelled door

In the slightly open doorway Christine Vole is standing
her face completely immobile She withdraws her hand and
the door slowly closes blocking her from view

During this the Usher is trying to re-establish order

Silence Silence
The Courtrocm calms down

VOLE

MAYHEW

VOLE
Lets go quickly before they
change their mind-

They go into the Prisoners Dock and down the steps
leading below A policeman and usher are gathering
up the exhibits

BROGAN-MOORE
(looking after Vole
smiling)
Chipper isnt he An hour ago
he had one foot on the gallows
and the other on a banana peel
(to Wilfrid)
You ought to be very proud Wilfrid -
(Wilfrids brow 1s lined with
thought ) -
Are you

SIR WILFRID
Not yet- Weve disposed of the
gallows but there is still that
banana peel - scmewhere -- under
somebodys foot

There is the sound of angry commotion outside the Court-
The Policeman and Usher who have
been collecting the exhibits drop their work and go
Sir Wilfrid Brogan-Moore and
‘o

13h

Through the glass-panelled door we can see a bit of a
riot -- the crowd in an ugly mood shouting insults and
waving fists The Policeman and Usher try to break it
up and we see that the object of the crowd is Christine

The Policeman and Usher help her into the Courtroom She
is dishevelled a little roughed up her hat in one hand
and she is rubbing her shin

POLICEMAN ‘
Better wait here until we get rid
of that crowd Madam

CHRISTINE
Thank you

Policeman and Usher go ont again to break up the
disturbance

Sir Wilfrid Brogan-Moore and Carter look at her Then
Carter resumes gathering up the defense papers also
bringing up Sir Wilfrids thermos from under his seat

CARTER
Ready sir Miss Plimsoll will
be waiting

SIR WILFRID
Let me finish the last of the cocoa--
(uncapoing the thermos)
While I am still beyond her
jurisdiction

He motions to Carter and to Brogan-Moore to get out
Now he 1s alone in the Courtroom with Christine

He sips the brandy studying her over the rim of the cup
She brushes her suit straightens her stockings looks
around as if for something she had lost

CHRISTINE ™
I never thought you British could
get so emotional -- especially in
a public place

SIR WILFRID
I apologize for my compatriots

CHRISTINE
Itts all risht I dent mind being
ealled names or pushed around or
even kicked in the shin - but now I
have a ladder in my last pair of nylons

with perjury tried for it and

‘to prison you shall go

prosecution it would be

CRHISTINE

What are you driving at
CHRISTINE

I am not driving at anything any
more Leonard is free and we
did iti

SIR WILFRID
We

CHRISTINE
Thats right Remember when I
came to see you and you said
that no jury would believe an
alibi given by a loving wife
no matter how much she swore
that her husband was innocent
That gave me the idea --
h9e SIR WILFRID
’ What idea

CHRISTINE
The idea that I should be a witness
not for my husband but for the
rosecution - that I should swear
Fst Teonard was guilty -- and
that you should expose me as 4
vicious liar -- because only then ’

would they believe that Leonard
was innocent

He stares at her fumbling for his monocle- She
crosses slowly toward him

CHRISTINE
So now you know the whole story
Sir wilfrid
(lapsing into Cockney)
Itll give you somethin to dream
about mister

She leans over and like the Cockney woman in the
Ruston Station pulls the hair from one side of her face

y CHRISTINE
a Wanna kiss me Ducky

SIR WILFRID
(shocked)
I suspected something - but not
that -- never that

Christine re-adjusts her hair speaks gently now to
Sir Wilfrid who is plainly stunned

CHRISTINE
Thank you for the compliment Its
been a long time since I was an -

actress and I never before played
’ -such an important role --

SIR WILFRID
And all those blue letters --

CHRISTINE
It took me hours to write them --
to invent Max -- there never was
a Max there never has been anyone
but Leonard only Leonard

SIR WILFRID
(with some difficulty)

My dear -- could you not have trusted
me -- worked with me truthfully and
honorably -- we would have wone

(he shakes himself
loose from her Her
eyes fall on the flickerti
t from Wilfrids monocle
flashing on the blade of
the knife on the exhibit
table)
-- or better yet let them try me
for murder

the knife lurches after him and with one

wild swoop plunges the knife into him He looks at
her as if almost in surprise then crumples instantly-

Diana shrieks piercingly-

Christine
her hand

stands quietly erect the Imife no longer in
Misa Plimsoll rushes forward professional

nurse that she is and kneels beside Vole her hand on
his wrist

Sir Wilfrid still twirling his monocle turns his eyes
to the main door thru which come running three court

officers drawn by the girls scream- They swoop down

on Christine surrounding Voles body
Uy

Sir Wilfrid sits quietly watching From off we

hear an officer crying cet a doctor and the sobbing
of Diana» Then Miss Plimsoll comes to Wilfrid He
looks up at her

MISS PLIMSOLL
She killed him

SIR WILFRID
(shaking his head) ‘
She executed him

Sir Wilfrid looks off toward Christine A policeman is
by the body and giving unheard instructions Two
policemen start to lead Christine out Carter distraught
and puzzled comes in makes his way to Sir Wilfrid

CARTER
not realizing)

ahead and Ive got a car waiting
outside

Then Carter gasps as he sees- But Wilfrids eyes are
still on the big main doors through which the police
are just taking out Christine» She stops in the open
doors looks back at Wilfrid Miss Plimsoll looks at
Wilfrid then at ths doors then back to him

SL WILFRID

There is a long exchange of looks between the two then
Miss Plimsoll reaches down for his wig hands it to him

SIR WILFRID

He gets up with some difficulty and straightens up
c

SIR WILFRID

(to Carter)

He moves away from his seat and walks past the Bench to
the barristers’ exit an erect and dignified figare

Miss Plimsoll looks after him with great prides She
suddeniy sees the thermos bottle

MISS PLIMSOLL
(calling after him)
Sir Wilfrids -- you forgot your brandy

He stops smiling She grabs the thermos and takes it

to him qnickly He puts bis arm across her shoulder
as they walk out of the courtroom
