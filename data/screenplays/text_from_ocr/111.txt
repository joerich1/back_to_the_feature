OPEN ON BLACK SCREEN WITH FLASHING TV NEWS SHOWS ON A TV
SCREEN MOVING TOWARDS US

Dozens of news shows flash on the screen ABC NBC CNN FOX
MSNBC CBS The Weather Channel ESPN etc etc All fronted
by dozens of anchors Jennings Brokaw Aaron Brown Rather
Chung etc etc

NARRATOR (VO)

(powerful and assured)
Television news There are hundreds
of 24 hours channels local and
network news shows bombarding us
every waking second And with each
show an endless list of news
anchors trying to convince you that
they and only they speak the
truth And what do these voices of
the truth tell us Be afraid Be
very afraid

The shows multiply across the screen forming a cacophony of
anchors

NARRATOR
But there was a time in our not too
distant past when the world as we
know it was a much simpler place

We dissolve to WISPY CLOUDS and a BLUE SKY

NARRATOR
This was a less cynical time A
time when people believed
everything they heard on TV -- a
time before cable -- Three channels
were all there was and viewers were
happy You heard me right three
channels

MUSIC a sparkling gliss

We emerge from the clouds to find ourselves over Center City
Portland 1973

MUSIC the initial pulsing bass lines of Cherry Cherry by
Neil Diamond

NARRATOR
It was 1973 and in a city like
Portland the news was clear -- and

if it wasnt you turned on the TV
