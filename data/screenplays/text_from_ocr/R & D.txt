STAN (twenties) waits Nervously A GUARD waits with him

Stan taps instructions into his Bee a device he wears like
a wristwatch STANS GUIDE (a hologram that is his
information interface with the world) pops up in front of
him in the form of a SEXY BLONDE who smiles seductively

STANS GUIDE

continues (hes scrolling through different versions of his
Guide)

STANS GUIDE
How bout some music while you

A door opens Stan taps his Bee his Guide disappears

human -- like an executive in a business suit calm easy
self-assured -- except that hes quicker sleeker more
efficient His (human) assistant MANDY accompanies him

fe)
Sorry to keep you waiting Stan
busy day

O nods to the Guard who leaves Stan blurts out anxiously

questions just give me a shout

Mandy opens a door to an anteroom Stan heartened goes
through the door Smells something Stops panicked Turns
back -- but the door slams shut

A blinding red light flashes around the door frame

fe)
Its the smell that frightens
them we need to work on that

MANDY
(making a note)
Smells like X bombs -- that kind
of sensory-inspired fear is hard
to get rid of in us humans --

O smiles -- a smile that turns your blood cold Mandy
realizes shes committed a faux-pas -- and is frightened
MANDY

Sorry about that us humans
wasnt thinking

fe)
Im not sensitive you know that

MANDY
I also know you want to be treated
as if youre like us

O shrugs it off and strides out tapping his Bee which is
implanted in his wrist

replacements for Stan of the
Holloway family --

CUT TO
EXT THE CITY - DAY

Welcome to America a few years from now It doesnt look
very different from today Its much more crowded -- large
buildings hunch up against each other soaring shafts of
steam plume out of buildings and up from beneath the
streets -- but everything is organized clean and
emphatically fun more Disneyland than Blade Runner

The busy masses of people are polite -- if very much in their
own worlds occupied with their Bees and Guides

They pay little attention to (if they notice at all) the bomb
sites everywhere A cafe a church the whole front of a
building are all being repaired by efficient partially
automated crews

The destruction is hidden by temporary walls onto which
(like the walls of all the buildings) is projected news
entertainment and ads Its all bright upbeat and
distracting like this ad

ANNOUNCER
Upgrade to your new free Bee 60
today and receive TWO THOUSAND
free credits plus fifteen points
toward Premiere Status

The Announcer morphs as people pass their own Bees altering
the Announcers look and voice

ANNOUNCER

fresh new interface that makes it
easier than ever to change your
Guide Dont like blondes Gone
Want your Guides voice lower
Your sense is our command And

The Bee device in the ad morphs into a smiling honey bee
ANNOUNCER
Remember were your Bee -- but to

MOTHERs sleeve

EXT STREET - DAY
Tina comes upon a BANK that has just been bombed Its still
smoldering workers are pulling out bodies and sliding in

temporary walls to mask the devastation

Tina is the only passer-by who stops and looks Her studly
Guide tries to distract her

TINAS GUIDE
This branch is closed babe

Tina peers at the damage inside the bank Smiles
TINAS GUIDE

creative bright -- but he denies these qualities even to
himself sensing that they are not useful even suspect)

FIRST ASSISTANT
Smart funny loyal hard worker --

SECOND ASSISTANT
Hes risky his parents were
revolutionaries -- members of the
so-called Free Republic
(e)
Do I detect sarcasm They had the
right to call themselves whatever
they liked its a free country

SECOND ASSISTANT
They engaged in illegal acts
against the State --

And they failed nobody remembers
anything about them any more they
didnt engage the popular
imagination Not surprising with
a name like Free Republic

FIRST ASSISTANT
(pointedly to Second
Assistant)

Anyway theyre dead

Years ago car accident --

ie)
Any sign of revolutionary
sympathies

SECOND ASSISTANT
Hard to say he keeps his head
down

FIRST ASSISTANT
Wed know I mean

He gestures to the surveillance info that surrounds them

SECOND ASSISTANT
But we dont necessarily know
surveillance doesnt tell us
everything -- isnt that why were
recruiting these people for R and D

fe)
Its about balance You want them
to have initiative be curious
creative -- but not too much
FIRST ASSISTANT

Syria We hired some Hollywood
screenwriters to imagine what the
bad guys would do next

Craftsman house a real throw-back The city has built up
around it enclosing it

Hank knocks on the door Its opened by MRS JACKSON sixty-
ish with a big kind grandmotherly smile -- but make no
mistake shes sharp and the sugar masks vinegar underneath

MRS JACKSON
Mr Skinner youre here Was the
traffic bad We were worried

Hank steps in through the looking-glass --
INT HOLLOWAY HOUSE - DAY

HANK
Worried

MRS JACKSON

conferences started on time --

HANK

MRS JACKSON
Youre a member of the Holloway
family now we pride ourselves on
being punctual But the cookies
are still warm I baked them
myself

She offers him a plate of fresh-baked cookies You dont say
no to her Hank reaches for one --

SUSANNA
Dont touch them

Hank jerks his hand away

SUSANNA BLADE (early twenties seems self-assured has great
equipment and knows how to work it) steps in singing White
Rabbit

SUSANNA
One pill makes you larger and
one pill makes you small --
(taking him in)
You must be my new brother --

HANK
New brother

SUSANNA
Youre replacing Stan he was the
hottest brother I ever had till

now

MRS JACKSON

tried so hard didnt you dear

with our work here in the family

SUSANNA

Hank)

HANK

MRS JACKSON
Masculine I was in military
intelligence When they put me
out to pasture I took up writing

SUSANNA
She gives most of her royalties to
the National Rifle Association
Seriously

MRS JACKSON
Well we cant all be bohemians

GILMAN HOLLOWAY (forties) comes downstairs carrying a toy
Flash Gordon-type weapon Hes passionate about the work
but the passion hides a dark anger and fear underneath

GILMAN
(to Hank)
Sorry to be late -- Gilman
Holloway -- Im the Dad I was

up all night with this --
He points the toy weapon at a wall and FIRES IT

Theres a nearly silent BLAST -- but when the smoke clears
the wall looks unchanged

SUSANNA
Ive had nights like that

Gilman sticks his hand through where he fired that part of
the wall has been blasted away replaced by a hologram of the
wall the way it was

GILMAN
It takes a photo of the target
right before it fires then
instantly projects a hologram of
the target the way it was

SUSANNA
Cool

MRS JACKSON
Thats how Al Amir got into the
power plant without anyone knowing
(off Gilmans nod)
O will be pleased Have a cookie
(to Hank proudly)
Gilmans the one who figured out
how to get the Star Wars shield up
and running

GILMAN
Didnt do much good turned out
the enemy was inside the shield

GILMAN (contd)
(re the weapon)
Stupid looking prototype but it
was lying around

SUSANNA

(quietly)
Was it Amys

(off Gilmans nod to

Hank)
This was Gilmans house his kid
sister Amy was killed by
terrorists

MRS JACKSON
And hes done an excellent job of
moving on

revealing black blobs inside --

As O briefs the family (Hank Susanna Mrs Jackson and
Gilman) via a holographic video hook-up

fe)
Weve been tracking Tina Falks
cell for several days no apparent
connections to other terrorist
groups

MRS JACKSON
There are so many out there

fe)
We believe these devices to be
bombs but theyve somehow
disguised them so we cant get
visuals Of course that makes
them suspicious in and of itself --

HANK
Why havent you arrested them Or
picked up those bombs

SUSANNA
Cause the bombs are decoys
right Look at her body
language --

She imitates Tina as surveillance video showing Tina
planting her purse in the office is projected on the wall

SUSANNA
Shes putting on a show -- making
sure shes not blocking a
surveillance camera opening the
drawer more than necessary so we
can see inside Its like she
wants surveillance to see her

fe)
Exactly What we need you to
figure out is Why plant decoys
What are they trying to distract
us from

HANK
I still dont get why you dont
arrest them

fe)
You think theyll just tell us
what their plan is We have to
keep the cell in play until you
can figure it out

HANK
But if those are real bombs
theyre gonna go off --

MRS JACKSON
And thats why we need to get to
work dear
(for her earwig)
Decoys domestic terrorist groups

Research files pop up on the wall in front of her --

Susanna leads Hank in as she listens to her earwig

SURVEILLANCE TECH (VO)

Susanna looks at that table spots Tina eating alone
Susanna leads Hank to a table facing Tina who is oblivious

SUSANNA
So whats she thinking about
HANK
Im not psychic
SUSANNA
Me I need to imitate their body
language act them out -- it helps

me get inside their skin feel
what theyre feeling Maybe you
need to do something like that to
draw them

They look at Tina who is eating a huge lunch A WAITRESS
brings her a jar of McMahons mayonnaise which she slathers
on her food

SUSANNA
She can put it away

HANK
And shes so skinny

SUSANNA
I hate her

Susanna hands him a pencil as if to say Go

Hank picks up the pencil Looks at Tina as he takes his

sketchpad out of his backpack Puts pencil to paper -- draws
for a moment -- then tosses the pencil down
HANK

This is stupid

He gets up Susanna grabs his hand

SUSANNA
Find a way to make it work

Hes surprised by her urgency

SUSANNA

You dont run out on your family
HANK

I have my own family
SUSANNA

Well I dont -- or I didnt before

the Holloways My foster parents
adopted me for the benefits I got
them on the fast track to Premiere
Status

HANK
What about your birth parents

SUSANNA
Dont know The Holloways are my
family now

It takes getting used to but it
works

CUT TO
INT HANKS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hank tosses in his bed Turns on the light Gets up Picks
up his sketch pad Looks at drawings of his real family

O (VO in Hanks earwig)
Any brainstorms

HANK
(startled)
God Whatre you watching me
sleep
oO (V0O)

The people youve sketched
theyre all people you know

Maybe you need to know our subject
better Ill prepare a file And
we really do need you to move in
to the Holloway house

Hank doesnt respond switches on a lamp

oO (V0O)
Is there a problem

HANK
Well I cant sleep with this
thing in my ear

INTERCUT
INT OS OFFICE - NIGHT

Surveillance of Hank in his apartment is on a wall screen
But O is gazing at another image (which we dont see -- yet)
with well lust What is it hes looking at

(e)
We can give you something to help
you sleep

HANK
You been able to find anything
about Val

fe)
The last surveillance we have of
her is at the Northern railroad

station -- taking off her Bee
That makes tracing her more
challenging

We finally see what O is gazing at lustily on a wall screen
its Val asleep in a jail cell

Dont worry well find her

Hank turns off his lamp
WE STAY WITH O

Without taking his eyes off Val O drops his hand and starts
stroking down there rhythmically faster and faster --

Suddenly he stops aware of something spins around to see

Mandy (his assistant) staring at him shocked Shes just
come in her hand is still on the door

In one incredibly fast movement O zips up his pants shuts
the door and forces Mandy to sit down

He looks down at her regaining his composure and power
waiting for her to say something

MANDY
(shaking)
Youre human

fe)
Unfortunately But I have had
some work done

MANDY
Work

Some people have surgery to change
their mood or improve their
strength -- I went in for neural
transplants

He goes to his desk takes out a syringe and a plastic vial

Synthetic cells They speed up
synapse connections enable me to
process information more
efficiently --

As Mandy watches not daring to move O drains down the vial
into the syringe

fe)
People dont question androids
They trust them to make
unemotional choices efficient
decisions Its easier to
maintain authority when people
dont question you

He whips a rubber strap out of his desk tourniquets it
around his arm and shoots up

(e)
Experimental but the results speak
for themselves Although I
havent been able to rid myself of
all emotions yet -- as you saw

He pops off the strap -- and holding the drained syringe
approaches Mandy She cant take her eyes off the empty
needle

Its bracing like an icy
cocktail I can feel my cells
firing

O (contd)
Right now Im evaluating possible
scenarios much more effectively
than you ever could

He grabs her Terrified she struggles to free herself

Dont struggle let me do the

work Thats what androids are

for
He jabs the syringe into her neck emptying air into her vein

CUT TO

INT HANKS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hank wakes up -- the apartment is filled with fog or is it
steam Its weird nightmarish

Alarmed Hank rises trying to peer through it He slides
silently out of bed treads carefully toward the kitchen --

A hand grabs his arm Hank spins toward the intruder
Through the fog all he can see is a powerful man --

The man (REB) drags Hank to the stove pushes Hanks head
down toward a pot of boiling water Hank desperately
struggles to free himself --

But Reb is too strong -- he twists Hanks head so that Hanks
ear is right over the boiling water --

Hank furiously fights to get free --

Suddenly Reb lets go of Hanks head -- but then he grabs
Hanks arm and holds it over the boiling water

REB
Im not going to hurt you Their
surveillance doesnt work through
steam -- I temporarily disabled
your earwig now Im going to do
your Bee

Hank looks at his Bee through the steam -- its display
fizzles out

REB
Ive only got a minute before
theyre back online

Hank sees that the steam that shrouds the apartment comes
from a device strapped to Reb

HANK
Who the hell are you

REB
I dont have a name I dont
exist not in Their records Im

going to let you go okay
Hank nods Reb lets him go
Hank lunges for the door Reb grabs him They struggle

REB
Listen to me listen Your job
its bogus theyre lying to you

Reb gets Hank in a clinch

REB
You think your bank accounts just
happened to be depleted the day
They offered you a job Your
girlfriend didnt take your money

HANK
(floored)
What do you know about her

REB
Your brothers cancer why do you
think it suddenly got worse

HANK
-Whatre you saying They
somehow spread his cancer so Id --

REB
Theyre going to tell you your
girlfriend is dead

HANK
What

REB

Theyre going to tell you shes
dead its the way they work cut
you off so you have nobody but
your new Family They did it to
your predecessor but he wouldnt
play along thats why they
promoted him

Hanks Bee buzzes back to life Reb spots it

HANK
Whatre you saying They killed
him

Reb disappears into the steam

HANK
Wheres Val

Hank peers around as the steam dissipates Reb is gone
CUT TO

Morning rush hour everybody consults with their Bees Hank
hurries past a wall ad for a no-steam iron

that unhealthy steam

He slows as he takes that in then hurries on --
CUT TO
INT HOLLOWAY HOUSE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Wall screens are filled with images Hank and Susanna pour
over surveillance files of Tina and the other cell members
Mrs Jackson and Gilman refer to weapons files while
consulting with O in his office via the video hologram

MRS JACKSON
I cant find any precedent of
decoy bombs that are fake -- to
divert attention the decoy has to
be a real threat

GILMAN
And I havent been able to infer
what the bombs might be but there
is evidence of timing devices

fe)
How much time do we have

Gilman shakes his head he doesnt know

MRS JACKSON
Were focusing on the wrong thing
The decoys are irrelevant theyll
only cause collateral damage --

HANK
Collateral damage You mean
theyll only kill irrelevant
people

MRS JACKSON

Of course not dear I mean
whatever this cell is planning has
to be bigger than a couple of
hundred casualties

(to O)
You should arrest those three
terrible people and interrogate
them

GILMAN
There may be other cell members
involved you dont want to tip
them off --

HANK
This is weird -- theyre all
eating tons of food

MRS JACKSON
(impatiently)
Do try to stay focused Hank --

Surveillance shows Tina the Teenager and the Gardener eating
huge meals everywhere

HANK
I mean look at Tina Shes skinny
as a rail but since last week
shes been putting it away

SUSANNA
And the teenager and the other guy
have been porking out too

GILMAN
McMahons mayonnaise

MRS JACKSON
What

HANK
Hes right McMahons
mayonnaise -- its in every shot
theyre all eating it

MRS JACKSON
(thinking out loud)
Maybe its a signal -- or maybe
theyre preparing to run off

SUSANNA
Whatre you saying theyre
squirreling away mayonnaise for
the winter

MRS JACKSON
Im sure you must have a better
idea then dear

SUSANNA
(thinking out loud)
McMahons is the fattest kind of
mayonnaise around -- why would
they all want to put on weight

HANK
To raise their cholesterol --

GILMAN
That would take months

Hank takes out his pad and starts sketching Tina
CUT TO
INT SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY

Tina the Teenaged Boy and the Gardener finish sandwiches
which they slather with McMahons Mayonnaise

Some of that gooey white substance covering the aluminum foil
that blocks the window slides off The Gardener gets up
slaps some more mayonnaise over the window in its place

TINA
Its time for our next step

The Teenaged Boy and Gardener glance at each other
TINA

No seeing each other any more

The Gardener folds the Teenager into an embrace as if
theyre father and son -- and never going to see each other
again
They rise somberly something weighty just happened

SUSANNA
I hope youre not vegetarian
Kissing vegetarians is like making

out with a lawn

Hank is surprised that Susanna knew he was there without
seeing him Mrs Jackson working at a counter notices

MRS JACKSON
Eyes in the back of her head

Susanna moves to the stove to check out pasta which boils
away cascading steam around her

MRS JACKSON
And a real bitch in bed

That surprises Hank Susanna doesnt react

MRS JACKSON
Deaf as a post when her earwigs
off-line poor lamb Save
anything you dont want her to
hear for when shes steamed up

Susanna moves away from the stove and steam

Hank notices Mrs Jackson is chopping two different things
with two knives one in each hand She catches his look

MRS JACKSON
We need to get back to work ASAP
Those veggies need to be washed
(as Hank does so)
Being ambidextrous only indicates
you have a predisposition for our
work You have to develop it

HANK
- I dont know if I can

Gilman comes in with a color chart

GILMAN
How many colors do you see here
HANK
Eight
GILMAN
The Berinmo tribe in Papua New
Guinea sees five -- they only have

names for five colors Our work
its like opening yourself up to
see new colors Its wonderful

MRS JACKSON
My sainted father loved reading
stories aloud -- but I always knew
how they were going to end I
could see actually visualize the
stories from inside the heads of
the characters Spoiled it for
Dad I always thought I was
freakish --

SUSANNA
Cant argue with that --

MRS JACKSON
-- until I started doing this work

GILMAN
Exactly its made me feel
normal -- no not normal useful
My sister all the other kids
played with their toys -- as soon
as I got one Id take it apart
and put it back together ina
better way All they saw was
parts and computer chips -- I saw
purpose and beauty

SUSANNA
My turn Im the deaf bitch in
bed
(to Mrs Jackson)
My earwig isnt my only resource
Im keeping the rest to myself

Hank dries his hands heads for the back door

HANK
Im going home for a while

MRS JACKSON
This is your home now

HANK
Look Ill help you as much as I
can but this family thing living
together its too weird
(heading out)
I just need to take a break --

And we need you here You boys
always think you can come and go --

HANK
(that stops him)

dont feel emotions youve spent
most of your life trying not to

Hank wont let O see his grief He stalks to the front door

The irony is youll only be
useful to us if you allow yourself
to feel

HANK
(turning back)
Useful Are you threatening me

fe)
Of course not -- but it would be
disappointing if you gave up so

quickly

(goes to him hands

him a card)

to interact emotionally with the
subject to get into them -- thats
why your drawings of Val and your

incisive

Based on his performance Stan was
promoted You could be too

confusion)

Hank starts to leave -- but something Reb says makes sense to
him no matter how much he tries to talk himself out of it

HANK
They need us to --

REB
Fight terrorists Thats their
excuse and your ego

HANK
So what theres no terrorists
Is that what youre saying

Surveillance is the States
greatest strength -- but its also
Their greatest vulnerability If
we can shatter it Their power
will be devastated Well help

Reb takes

HANK
Collateral damage Youre as
bad as they are --

REB
As bad as Them They killed
hundreds of thousands They
amended our Constitution until
it meant nothing You think you
can reason with Them Decades of
talk and protests what good did
it do People are more numb than
ever theyre doped up on

do is give people back the right
to think for themselves You
remember what that was like

He looks away knowing theres truth in it

Like I said theyre not looking
for these But just to be safe --

a jar of McMahons Mayonnaise out of his bag

Coat them with this -- something
in the molecular structure the
synthetic fat surveillance cant
see through it

Hank takes the jar of mayonnaise Thats a coincidence

stares at

Reb misunderstands Hanks confusion

Reb holds

REB
So simple I know But were only
a step ahead of Them -- soon

enough Theyll figure this out
and well have to come up with
something else

out the X-bombs for Hank

REB
Well contact you the best way to
avoid being seen by Their

MRS JACKSON
That courtroom at the Federal
Center is a symbol of oppression
to these terrorist groups --

Hank pulls the sketch of Tina dead from his pocket realizes

HANK
The bombs are inside them blocked
from surveillance Theyre a bomb

MRS JACKSON
Together -- When theyre all
together

SUSANNA
Youve got to stop them before
they meet in the courtroom --

(issuing an order)
Federal Center Stop the guards

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOLLOWAY HOUSE - HANKS BEDROOM - DAY

Hank is unpacking when Susanna comes in

SUSANNA
We just got the debrief They had
swallowed chemical agents they
would have mixed through the
air -- the charge wouldve taken
out a half-mile

HANK
The chemicals could mix through
their skin

SUSANNA
Skin is porous

She takes his hand He tenses up

SUSANNA
I dont bite

HANK
(covering with a joke)
Youre my sister

SUSANNA
(seductively)
Were a very tight family

HANK
What happened to Stan

SUSANNA
(frightened)
He was promoted

HANK
To what

SUSANNA
(dare she tell him
the truth)
To Glory
She leaves

Hank lifts a photo of Val out of his suitcase Hes startled
to find something taped to the back of it

Its a business card for the MIDTOWN SAUNA

O (V0O)
(in Hanks earwig
startling Hank)
Could you step into the family
room please Hank

Hank slips the business card into his pocket
CUT TO
INT HOLLOWAY FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Video and photos of the Familys new assignments fill the
wall screens as O briefs them via video hologram

-- with this chip and wiring
implanted in a paraplegics brain
he can move his prosthetic arm by
just thinking about it

MRS JACKSON
Surveillance of the research
facility doesnt show who stole

the chip

(e)
The chip wasnt stolen from the
facility -- it was stolen from the

subject of the experiment --

Video of a dead paraplegic whose head has been sliced open

fe)
-- at a time when he was off
surveillance Weve upgraded our
systems so they can see through
condiments but we still have a
problem with steam

Hank fingers the business card for the Sauna in his pocket

(e)
We need you to tell us what uses
terrorists might make of the
chip -- that should help us find
the people who stole it

GILMAN
They could build an army of robots
controlled by thought which cant
be traced --

fe)
Yes thats an application we have
envisaged But what uses might it
have in the hands of evil-doers
that we havent imagined

The Family kicks into gear pulling up video etc -- except
for Hank who shoves the sauna card deeper into his pocket

HANK
Id like to take a couple of hours
off -- Im not really useful

unless I get involved with the
subject right And since you
dont know who the subject is
yet

fe)
(with a smile)
We know how to find you

Hank heads for the front door --

fe)
Hank -- how did you know about the
mayonnaise

HANK

(covering alarm)
What

fe)
McMahons Mayonnaise -- howd you
know it was impenetrable to
surveillance

HANK

I didnt know I figured it out

fe)
Pretty big leap

HANK
Thats what you hired me for

He leaves
