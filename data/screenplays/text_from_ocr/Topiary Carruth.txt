A TOPIARY
by

Shane Carruth
NOTE For a couple reasons this screenplay does not adhere to
the one-page minute convention 1 Although most scenes are
incredibly brief there are more than twice as many of them
here than an average script resulting in more description and
scene headings 2 Many objects in this story dont have a
real-world analogue again resulting in more description

The first act involving the adults in the early 1980s is
paced somewhere between a traditional narrative and the
previously on section of a TV show (assume there is a CUT
TO between every action) It will run at about 30 seconds a
page taking 30 minutes of screen time The kids story runs
at 40 seconds a page for another 2 hours of screen time

INT 1979 VOLKSWAGEN VANAGON - DAY

A family is traveling on a busy six-lane highway The camera
is locked down in the back facing forward for the duration of
the scene We can see the top of the heads of three KIDS
seated in the back seat

Beyond them MOM is turned toward the kids and struggling with
putting a straw in a JUICE BOX DAD drives

MOM
I would take the bus down um after
school- the city bus- and I would go by
myself-

KID ON THE RIGHT
Which one is it

Mom has to duck down to see the far off skyline to the vans
left She points out a specific building as she talks

MOM
See the one with the red trim all the way
down The one right next to it
Granddads office was about halfway up
See all the floors

Mom passes the juice box to the KID IN THE MIDDLE and begins
filling a small TUPPERWARE DISH with Cheetohs

MOM
And thats where I would go and look out
while I did homework or you knowand
there is a glass elevator that your Aunt
Willa and I-

KID ON THE LEFT
(impatient)
Mom

Without a look Mom instantly realizes his meaning and adjusts
an air conditioning vent to point slightly more in his
direction testing it with her fingers

MOM
Feel that

KID ON THE LEFT
Not really

MOM
Well I dont know what to do Justin I
think youll be okay

A white PICKUP TRUCK quickly changes lanes in front of the
van The IMPACT is deafening and forces everything in the van
forward immediately Cheetohs and luggage and toys are
airborne but its not over

The van is now perpendicular to the road so we appear to be
moving sideways Dad is standing on the brake and fighting
the steering wheel as we spin out of control

DAD
No No No

Mom has her right hand on the roof to steady herself and the
other arm flails behind her in an impossible attempt to shield
the kids

After two seconds there is a final impact and this one bends
the cabin in decreasing the interior by half The passengers
are slammed left Bits of glass fly everywhere

When things settle Dad is the only one still remotely in the
same spot They are all completely limp

Seconds pass Through the shattered windshield we can see
cars pulling over A few people run towards the van

EXT HIGHWAY - DUSK

Miles of HEADLIGHTS are backed up on the road behind the

accident scene in the foreground The flashing lights of
several EMERGENCY VEHICLES swirl quietly No one scrambles

The van is bent around a pylon of an overpass

list
ACRE
You got it

INT CIVIC CENTER HALLWAY - DAY
Acre walks down the large hall Lobbyist and his associate

Acre leads them through a mini-lecture at a wall-mounted map
of the city

ACRE
Deaths on suburban streets up here on the
turnpike downtown Seven years of

records hundreds of incidents-

LOBBYIST
And you find the center

ACRE
Yeah well a weighted average More
accidents on the highway here it tends to
pull the center in that direction It
gets compli-

LOBBYIST
Really interesting

LOBBYIST 2
And now to be even more current

Acres frustration grows

INT CIVIC CENTER LARGE COMMON OFFICE - NEXT

Defeated now Acre stares down at his desk across from the
lobbyists

LOBBYIST
-he just means the most current is the
most accurate Youre saying the same
things I think

LOBBYIST 2
I think so too Is this likely to change
the location

ACRE
Its a weighted average

Lobbyist 2 doesnt quite get the answer
ACRE (CONTD)

Yeah itll change
INT CIVIC CENTER MAP AND SURVEY ROOM - NEXT
Acre drops the single folder on the table preparing to work
The compass pencil draws a wide arc on a map eventually
meeting two other arcs at the exact same spot Just north of
the intersection of Lamar and Cheek-Sparger Amused

ACRE

Oh come on

INT CIVIC CENTER RECORDS BASEMENT - DAY

Acre works at a micro-fiche terminal Lobbyist sits down next
to him lays a REPORT on the table

LOBBYIST
I need to know if youre having a problem
doing this survey

ACRE

LOBBYIST
Are you manipulating it
INT CIVIC CENTER HALLWAY - DAY

Again Acre walks towards the office This time THREE MEN
wait for him Lobbyist Lobbyist 2 and Lobbyist 3

They stand across from him presenting a new plan

LOBBYIST 3
we take one high traffic month and one
month for winter and work from those
That way we get a true representation-

ACRE
You need to hire an outside firm
(beat)
Let them submit it to city This is
biased

LOBBYIST 2
Or why not use the survey team already on
payroll-

ACRE
You cant cherry pick records and expect-
its not our mandate
LOBBYIST 2
-and save the taxpayers some money How
is that biased
ACRE
Its not our mandate
INT CIVIC CENTER MAP AND SURVEY ROOM - DAY
Acre works a calculator like an angry pianist
He draws arcs on a wall map just like before
Slumped in a chair in front of the map he holds his head
his hands He suddenly grabs the folder and heads to

INT CIVIC CENTER HALLWAY - DAY

Acre walks towards the office again lost in thought
Lobbyist waits for him on the bench alone this time

Acre gives up He scans a pen over the city map that Lobbyist

is holding against a wall

ACRE
How about here You guys like this area
yeah
LOBBYIST

Youll write it up

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

The corner of Lamar and Cheek-Sparger is urban and well
trafficked probably hit its peak 30 years ago

Acre steps off a CITY BUS looking for something along the
ground He finds it

He crouches near a WATER MAIN VALVE jutting up from the
sidewalk By the time the bus pulls away hes comparing the
lookup number on the valve to his map paperwork

ACRE
326FR7326FR7

Rolling a MEASURE WHEEL along the ground to count out feet he
starts at the valve and walks north

He comes to a stop and turns 90 degrees facing the street

He counts out 5 feet putting him in the middle of the road
He marks the spot with a QUARTER and studies the asphalt for a
brief second It looks normal Hes forced out of the street
by an oncoming car

He waits to get back to the spot but another car comes Then
another Growing upset

ACRE
Come oncome on Come on

INT CIVIC CENTER SUPPLY CLOSET - DAY

A TRIPLICATE FORM is being filled out on a TYPEWRITER The
words Utilities and General Repair Requisition scroll past

Carriage return down to the words ASPHALT OVERLAY An X
goes in the box

Acre stands at what we now see is a discarded typewriter ona
cluttered shelf He rips out the form tears off the top
WHITE and YELLOW copies and throws them in the trash

The remaining PINK copy goes under the wheel of a chair
getting creased into the carpet as he rolls it back and forth

WOMAN (OFF SCREEN)
Oh my goodness

INT CIVIC CENTER STREETS MAINTENANCE DIVISION - NEXT

A woman JOHNNY (40s) stands behind the counter studying the
pink copy

ACRE
I know it was crammed under my desk
When they cleaned out all the asbestos a
while back-

JOHNNY

She shows him
ACRE
Jesus Johnny you got to help me

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

Lamar is completely closed off northbound A ROAD CREW is
repaving a 20 by 20 foot piece of road that has been dug up
An orange DETOUR SIGN directs cars away

A hand grabs a CAN OF SPRAY PAINT out of a nearby toolbox
Acre shakes the can as he walks up the street

Crouching at the spot he found earlier he sprays a circle on
the street all the way around himself

He stands satisfied with this accomplishment It takes a few
seconds for that to turn into what now

From one of the cafe chairs on the sidewalk he stares at his
painted circle waiting for inspiration It strikes and he
jumps out of his chair

Using a PAINTING WAND (for spraying straight lines) he begins
drawing lines radiating from the circle

5 lines are complete He holds his arm parallel to each of
the last 3 lines as he references his notes

ACRE

SHOPKEEPER (50s) moves off to fill the order Acre watches
hesitant and feeling stupid He finally gets the nerve

ACRE
How long you been- had the shop

Shopkeepers response is off camera and out of our earshot
but Acres face shows its not unusual

ACRE
No no onions Howd you settle on the
location

Acre collects the work crews lunch trash Scanning around
his eyes land on a pole-mounted power TRANSFORMER on the
corner He turns to the opposite corner and sees another
TRANSFORMER

ACRE
(to the Foreman)
Anyone call power and light before you
broke ground

FOREMAN (OFF SCREEN)
Were not that deep Just an overlay

Acre forms another question in his head but doesnt get it out
before we cut to

INT CIVIC CENTER STREETS MAINTENANCE DIVISION - DAY

Johnny hands the PINK FORM back to Acres waiting hands He
searches and takes a pen to it

ACRE
»a gravel base reconstruction theyre

He hands the form back to her

ACRE
Of course

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

Acre speaks to a city ELECTRICIAN at the mans truck Another
man is up in the bucket at the end of the trucks boom with
his hands in the transformers control box

ACRE
(referencing transformers)
Are these new maybe They look new No
Are they the same as- Yeah You guys
have to come down here a lot

EXT THE INTERSECTION ROOFTOP - DAY

Acre having a brown bag lunch looks down four stories at the
intersection now repaired and free of the work crew

Studying the spray painted circle from this height he places
his hands over it and then splays them outward to trace
imagined bits of energy shooting from it fwoosh

Something catches his attention on one corner Then another
Then another and another

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

He crowbars the lid off a manhole Then another Then
another and another

Filthy and exhausted he climbs out of the last manhole with a
flashlight and sits on the ledge despondent He has cordoned
off the immediate area with ORANGE CONES and ROPE

INT CIVIC CENTER ACRES OFFICE - DAY

People are heading out passing Acres desk He keeps his
head down in paperwork

COWORKER
Going to lunch

ACRE
Uhmeet you guys there

After leaving Coworker ducks his head back in

COWORKER
You know where were going

Acre looks up feigning stupidity

ACRE
Where you going

EXT THE INTERSECTION - NEXT

In a stairwell of one of the corner buildings he eats Chinese
noodles and watches the intersection through the third floor
window

ANOTHER DAY Has pizza leaning against a newspaper dispenser

ANOTHER DAY Gyro sandwich POURING RAIN keeps him in the
restaurant staring out the window

ANOTHER DAY Coffee under the awning at a fruit stand More
rain

ANOTHER DAY Clear skies CAR TIRES drive over a SURVEY TUBE
in the street We hear the CLICK of the counting machine

PAN OVER to the street perpendicular where tires run over
another SURVEY TUBE CLICK

ACRE studies the circular paper TRAFFIC GRAPH he has just
retrieved from one of the counting machines He shuts the
machines lid

He pulls out a TRAFFIC GRAPH from the second machine He

compares the two graphs Nothing He jams them in his back
pocket

INT SANDWICH SHOP - NEXT

Acre stares at the menu eyes glazed

SHOPKEEPER
Pork tenderloin

Acre waves it off

SHOPKEEPER
Turkey with cream cheese

ACRE
Had that

He turns to the intersection while Shopkeeper continues naming
sandwiches

EXT THE INTERSECTION - NEXT

He stands at the curb with a bag of chips looking down at the
painted circle listless

The noise of a HELICOPTOR pulls his attention to the sky for a
moment Then looking up the street he sees his BUS coming

He takes another glance upwards following the progress of the
helicopter as it nears a GLASS HIGH-RISE a mile away A brief
INTERPLAY OF SUNLIGHT reflects a STARBURST PATTERN off the
building blinding Acre for a moment

ACRE
Jesus

He winces throws his trash in a bin and boards the bus

INT CITY BUS - NEXT

He drops into his seat as the bus pulls away Still
recovering he takes a few long blinks and presses his
eyelids

He slowly takes his hand away but keeps his eyes shut He
turns his head subtly like hes following something on the
back of his eyelids

His eyes open and shift back and forth trying to contain the
afterimage drifting against the SEATBACK in front of him His
hands reach out to it

His fingers push into the BEIGE VINYL tracing a quickly fading
impression of the STARBURST

CUT TO For 4 seconds the screen is BLACK except for one
SHORT VERTICAL BLUE LINE on the far left It emits a SLOW
FLARE This break is called a SPECTRUM Well see others

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

A CAFE TABLE is dragged to the curb

Acre sits at the table staring up at the far off Glass High-
Rise determined Hes got a NOTEBOOK and LUNCH BAG

A WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM hangs near the top of the building

Acre checks the skies around him but no helicopter today
Eyes back on the building

The platform slides across to the next window Midway it
reflects a STARBURST for an instant

Acre squints and immediately begins drawing distinct lines on
his notebook pressing his eyelids once to refresh the image

Standing now he holds his SKETCH of the Starburst in his
hands rotating it until hes satisfied He brings the sketch
out of frame revealing two things he is at the Painted
Circle now and the sketch is a perfect match for it Almost

Comparing the two he sees that the Sketch has an extra spike
that the painted one doesnt

He SPRAY PAINTS the SIXTH SPIKE on the street and looks to
where it points the GLASS HIGH-RISE We now see that hes
cordoned off the area with orange cones forcing traffic
around him

He stands trying to piece all this together Suddenly his
face shows disappointment at not noticing before

He pulls the two TRAFFIC GRAPHS from his back pocket After
rotating them he sees they have the same pattern of spikes
jutting out from a common center He isolates one of the
traffic graphs and does a comparison by counting spikes

ACRE
(on the street painting)
One two three four five six
(on the traffic graph)
One two three four five sixseven

Of the graphs 7 spikes 5 are short (the ones that match the
original spray painted lines) 2 are LONGER and DARKER with
one pointing at the High Rise and one pointing back over
Acres shoulder He turns in that direction what are you
pointing at

Acre speaks excitedly on a payphone Meanwhile he uses his
fingers to compare the length of the two dark lines on the
traffic graph The High Rise line is about twice as long as
the other

ACRE
No I only need the distance line of
sight Campanile Tower From the corner
of Lamar and Cheek-Sparger I dont know
I dont know- theres a water main can I
read you the lookup I have the lookup
The six digit- the lookup

Growing impatient he notices a nearby TAXI stopped at a
light He yells at the driver

ACRE
Hey Are you free

INT TAXI - NEXT

With Acre in the back seat the taxi comes to stop at the base
of the High Rise He reads the meter 112 MILES and
writes this on the traffic graph next to the High Rise line
Next to the shorter dark line he writes 55 miles

ACRE
Great Lets go back

EXT THE INTERSECTION - NEXT

At the painted circle he orients himself with the short line
on traffic graph He sets out walking in that direction with
the measure wheel as the cab pulls away behind him

EXT STADIUM PARKING LOT - NEXT

Counting to himself Acre brings the wheel to a stop at an
unremarkable spot in the huge vacant lot that seemingly
extends to the horizon

He stares forward scanning the horizon
Crouching he inspects the ground and the surrounding area

He sits staring forward flicking pebbles that hes lined up
in a row beside him Before him in the distance is a busy
highway overpass Near that a construction CRANE slowly
rotates to deliver its payload Acres RADIO suddenly
squawks

RADIO
Acre you got an ETA on return over

ACRE
Yeah I got two more junctions Theres
traffic down here so give me twenty
minutes over

He flicks another pebble A STARBURST glints off the windowed
cabin of the crane Its identical to the traffic graph

Acre jumps to his feet He smacks his hands together I knew
it
ACRE
(whispering)
I have that one

He picks up the traffic graph off the ground and turns back to
the crane as if he might present it as proof

There is ANOTHER DIFFERENT STARBURST from the crane

Acre is puzzled After a moment he breaks the trance

ACRE
Oh

He scavenges the area for a suitable rock and begins marking
the ground with the starburst pattern At one point he closes
his eyes briefly to remember the shape

He stands in the center of the marking It has two spikes
One points back in the direction that he came from the other
about 90 degrees off that Acre aligns himself with the
second one and starts walking with the measure wheel

EXT FIELD - NEXT

He brings the wheel to a stop

He paces back and forth anticipating continually scans the
cityscape on the horizon

RADIO
Acre how far off are you on-

In one swift move Acre reaches to his belt and switches off
the radio never taking his eyes off the horizon

Far off in front of him a TRAIN crosses his view From ita
starburst flashes

ACRE
I have that oneand

A second later another different glint flashes from the same
spot

ACRE
okay

He carves the new starburst into the grass and dirt with his
boot
EXT RURAL COUNTY ROAD - DAY

Acres waits leaning against a telephone pole He grimaces as
a flash briefly lights his face

ACRE
One one thousand two one thousand three
one-

Another bright flash He starts the timer on his watch

EXT WATER TREATMENT PLANT - DAY
Another flash hits his face He stops the watch timer

He opens a map and marks it with the new starburst We can
see 10 other penciled shapes on the map each connected to the
next with a line He connects the latest to the series His
path has been almost a COMPLETE CIRCLE although warped

He shakes a spray paint can and finishes spraying the
starburst on the ground He looks in the direction the line
is pointing disappointed

EXT THE INTERSECTION - DAY

We follow Acre as he pushes the measure wheel towards the
original painted circle where it comes to a stop

ACRE
No no no no nowhat

He stares up at the Glass High Rise holding the traffic graph
in front of him mind racing Then he remembers something

He pulls the other traffic graph from his back pocket and
jams the first one in his front pocket

Using the new traffic graph he aligns himself and walks off
in the opposite direction with renewed energy He exits frame
on the left

DUSK

Acre pushes the measure wheel into frame from the right and
slows to a stop near the original spot having come full circle
again
He throws the wheel across the road in frustration
ACRE

At Secretarys desk

ACRE

DAYS LATER

Settled in at his new desk overlooking the intersection Acre
works the phone As he speaks his eyes dart from the
intersection to a small draining HOURGLASS

ACRE
-can you do me a favor We have a
client that did some construction on South
Rory Now Ive

The hourglass sand completely drains Effortlessly he flips
it over and opens a nearby NOTEBOOK to two pages each with an
INCOMPLETE TRAFFIC GRAPH DRAWN BY HAND One is entitled
PEDESTRIANS NORTHSOUTH and the other PEDESTRIANS
WESTEAST

He sees 5 people waiting to cross to the north side of the
intersection He writes 5 at the edge of the appropriate
traffic graph and then using a RULER adds a line that radiates
from a common center with the other lines

He sees 3 people crossing to the west side marks the other
graph and closes the notebook never missing a beat on the
phone

He sets out with the measure wheel

EXT COASTAL SAND DUNE - DAY
He spray paints a starburst among the beach grass

Using a sheet of TRACING PAPER placed over a map he marks his
progress warped circles like before

INT BRIGHTER DECADE ACRES DESK - DAY

He works the phone while putting the tracing paper into his
notebook over the map that shows his original path around the
city The warped circles are identical to the ones on the map
except that they are rotated at the center a few degrees

With each pair one circle has an indentation and the other a
protruding bump

ACRE

Sarah did someone from County Clerks

Whos John Billings

He flips the hourglass and turns to a page marked BLACK
BIRDS in the notebook

Using his finger he counts birds perched on the telephone wire
on the north side and then on the west side of the
intersection

He marks the traffic graphs with 7 and 19 and then flips
to the next page entitled BICYCLES (parked) He turns to a
half full BIKE RACK down at street level and across the street
to another where a man is unlocking and removing his bicycle

INT CITY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

A meeting is in session just like the last time we were in

Nearby is a wide opening into a DARK ROOM Acre stands and
steps toward it Amanda is still on the marking

AMANDA
Is it one of the first ones Car traffic

ACRE
I never used chalk

Amanda takes this in

AMANDA
Flashlights in the trunk

She heads for the car

He steps into the dark room

INT WAREHOUSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Several steps in he stops listening

Suddenly the HOLLOW WOODEN SOUND of a 2x4 dropped to the
floor jolts his attention to one side of the room

A moment later the room fills with the sound of PEOPLE
SCURRYING around and different objects SCRAPING the concrete
floor metal wood plastic

This is enough to send him towards the exit backing out

The LIGHTS crack on flooding the room in white Acre stops
squinting and shielding his eyes The room goes quiet except
for the hum of the overhead lights warming up

ACRE sees something across the room Then another something
And another and another until he has scanned the entire room

10 ORDINARY PEOPLE are scattered throughout the space facing
him They each hold an item or two that they must have picked
up off the floor PAINT CAN WOODEN DOWEL SODA CAN PLASTIC
BUCKET PIECE OF SHEETROCK ETC

One man stands next to a WHEELBARROW full of collected items
He places a busted THERMOS in it

Acre moves into the room inspecting the items in each persons
hands

Amanda arrives to see this and stands at the entrance

Acre stops in front of a bearded man CAROLL (40s) who holds
a large DENTED METAL PAIL Something about the pail interests
Acre He looks up from it to Caroll

Acre slowly places his hands on the pail and tries to draw it
in but Caroll tenses up and pulls it back Acre responds
with more force and an awkward struggle occurs before Acre
tears it away

Acre studies his prize Caroll stretches his hand out making
a half-hearted play for the pail

CUT TO

In the center of the room Acre kneels over the pail and his
maps Amanda has brought the satchel in The others stand
around them watching silently Almost embarrassed he speaks
to Amanda in a hushed voice

ACRE
Smaller one

AMANDA
Which

ACRE

Justsmaller
She hands him another map from the satchel

He places the bottom of the dented pail on it and it lines up
perfectly with the warped circle drawn on the map

He grabs one of Amandas CUT OUTS placing it right in the top
(the opening) of the pail Again it fits dent and all

CUT TO SPECTRUM The short vertical blue line is joined by
a YELLOW one near the center of the screen

INT AUTO BODY SHOP - NIGHT

The dented metal pail is doused with TALCUM POWDER

then dipped in WHITE CASTING LIQUID

The now solidified CAST is cut open with an ELECTRIC SAW The
pail is removed

and tagged and stored in a LARGE LOCKER containing TENS OF
OTHER TAGGED OBJECTS It closes and TWO PADLOCKS secure it

PLASTER is poured into the cast

A solid PLASTER COPY OF THE PAIL is pulled from the cast and
trimmed with scissors

Amanda and Acre stand off to the side of the large open
workspace observing the OTHERS using a system of ROPES and
PULLEYS to bring the LEFT HALF of a refrigerator-sized

CONSTRUCTION of lumber and assorted metal closer to the RIGHT

HALF Its all abstract angles and seems to be more of a

scaffold or skeleton than a finished functional thing It is

called the APOLOGUE
In hushed tones mid-conversation

ACRE
I dont know Im just trying-

AMANDA
And how- theyre all picking up junk off
the floor- how did they not know what they
were looking for Ask him

Acre walks across to Caroll who is overseeing things and

holding the plaster pail between the two Apologue halves as a

spacer Others begin to measure the space and try out
different lengths of METAL STRUTS to connect the halves

CAROLL
Now we know how long to make the struts

ACRE
I walked around for- I walked all over the
place for 8 months

CAROLL
Can you tell me something How is it that
you knew the shape of the pail if you
didnt even know you were looking for it

Acre returns to Amanda

is a pattern something there and we have
to acknowledge it And when successful it
leads to a poem

EXT GRASSLAND THE SEARCH LINE - DAY
Caroll Acre and Amanda are on the line quietly stepping
through the field with their eyes on the ground Amanda
carries their 6-month-old baby ELIJAH
A SHADOW quietly passes over Acre and Amanda Then Caroll
Far in the distance and behind the search line a CESSNA
CRASHES into the ground pushing soil into the air The faint
sound comes a couple seconds later
Here and there individuals in the line turn to see provoking
others to turn No one moves to help immediately
EXT GRASSLAND CESSNA - MOMENTS LATER
Everyone races toward the plane wreckage Some are already
pulling the BLOODIED BODIES of two men a woman and a child
from the cabin

Still a ways off Salman catches his breath

SALMAN
Caroll

Caroll stops 10 yards ahead of him and looks back

SALMAN (CONTD)
Transponder

Caroll understands and looks around for someone

CAROLL
Leslie

MOMENTS LATER

INSIDE THE CESSNA LESLIE and his ASSISTANT rip the
TRANSPONDER from under the front panel

OUTSIDE The transponder is laid out on a white sheet
Leslie crouches over it like its a puzzle to solve

ASSISTANT
Well smash it Ill get a rock

LESLIE
Quit- quit saying that Its only purpose
is to keep working if it is smashed

He fishes through a toolbox pulls out a SCREWDRIVER

Acre and the others finish pulling a BLACK TARP over the
wreckage

Caroll consults with Acre who looks at the tarp and shrugs

ACRE
I dont think its going to fool anybody
flying low but

For a few seconds their attention turns to something on the
horizon The last of the three dead bodies all of which are
now wrapped in sheets is being laid next to the other two

CAROLL
Maybe we cover it with sod A little on
the wings Just enough you know
INT GRASSLAND CAMPING TENT - NIGHT

Amanda breastfeeds studies a map Acre looks asleep

AMANDA
Are you awake Acre

He opens his eyes

AMANDA
Were being stupid

CUT TO Sitting he chugs a water jug looks at her map

AMANDA
There isnt a real city within three
hundred miles I havent seen a single
plane since we got here so were not under
any kind of flight path They drop right
on top of us

Acre lowers the jug realizing

EXT GRASSLAND CESSNA - PRE-DAWN

he tarp has been pulled back some Amanda crawls around
nside while outside Acre carrying Elijah works at opening
he luggage compartment underneath the tail section He cant
et the latch open

Amanda excitedly knocks on one of the windows and he quickly
turns to the cabin She places a PIECE OF PAPER flat against
the glass It is a sketch of a GLINT (starburst)

UT TO Amanda holds Elijah Acre kicks the latch open
UITCASES spill out onto the ground

DAWN

Caroll approaches taking in this sight Acre studies the
contents of the suitcases (NOTEBOOKS DRAWINGS) spread out
around them Amanda sleeps

ACRE
They have an elevation

CAROLL
How

Acre stands and approaches him

ACRE
Theres a whole notebook on it whole new
bifurcation They have it tagged to sea
level- even account for tides-

CAROLL
They know where the rock is

ACRE
We need more readers Where we stand the
elevation is off by two hundred feet
Were close I think but-

CAROLL
We gotta dig two hundred feet

ACRE
No Its above us

Caroll just stares at him
ACRE (CONTD)
We redo the math we have to but if its
within half a mile and two hundred feet
higher it can only be in one of three
places

Acre points him towards a HILL RANGE jutting out from the flat
ground

ACRE
There

Then he swings around to the opposite side and points out TWO
OTHER HILLS

ACRE
there or there

Caroll begins to make his way back to camp

CAROLL
Well get everyone reading

ACRE
Caroll

Caroll turns
ACRE (CONTD)
What about the bodies
(gesturing to the papers)
This is a contribution
He thinks on it
CAROLL
Well do a burial A service

EXT GRASSLAND HILLSIDE - DUSK

Were inside a DEEP TUNNEL a couple feet in diameter We
follow a SACK pulled by rope towards DAYLIGHT

OUTSIDE Men pull on the rope until the sack appears They

rummage through it finding mostly dirt and roots Holding a
WHITE PAIL Eric waits for them to find something of value

Behind them a TUNNEL CRAWLER emerges covered with filth and
carrying a small shovel He almost collapses to the ground
where a woman attends to him with water and towels

Eric sends a RUNNER off with the pail
ERIC (INTO RADIO)
Jen we got the last piece coming down
EXT GRASSLAND BASE OF HILL - MOMENTS LATER
The white pail is placed on the ground next to Jennifer She

retrieves from it a 14-INCH FOSSILIZED RIB BONE and places it
among other RIBS on a WHITE SHEET

»on which an ANIMAL SKELETON has been reassembled Eight
feet from head to toe it could be a saber-toothed tiger or
the largest meanest dog ever seen A PHOTOGRAPHER takes
pictures from different angles

The leaders stand around the sheet The mass of members looks
on from further back quiet and reverent Among them a BOY
sits on his FATHERS shoulders MOTHER is next to them

FATHER
Im not sure Wed have to see the
teeth- the shape of them to know

BOY
But its old right

FATHER
I think its very old

MOTHER
Someone would like to study that

BACK AT THE SHEET Caroll compares sketches in a NOTEBOOK to
the ribs his hand hovering from bone to bone An EXPERT
calls out the anatomical names

EXPERT
Ninth vertebrosternal Tenth
vertebrochondral

JENNIFER

Dimensions are right Probably the ninth
but might be tenth

CAROLL

Take bothand the two around them to be
sure Lets get the left side as well

EIGHT RIBS are packaged in ZIP LOC BAGS and carefully placed
in a SMALL COOLER cushioned with wadded-up newspaper

Eric unceremoniously pulls up the four corners of the sheet to
collect the remaining bones and swings this makeshift bag over
his shoulder

EXT GRASSLAND PLATEAU - MOMENTS LATER

Acre carries the cooler at the end of the procession making
its way back to the camp area The mood is solemn

A few children slowly approach Acre They gently touch the
cooler and move away A moment later a woman repeats the
action

We follow the cooler as different hands begin to touch it
Eventually Acre brings it up to under his arm to deal with
the jostling While no one is grabbing the cooler at least
once Acre is forced to break it from the friction of someones
hand

A MANS HAND glides from the side of the cooler to the top
sliding under the handle With a sudden jolt the hand tries
to tear the cooler from Acre but he reacts in time There is
an awkward scuffle

PROCESSION FRONT Walking with Amanda Caroll carries Elijah

CAROLL
(to Elijah)
So handsome Yes
(to Amanda)
All mine were so so ugly Not now youve
seen them Beautiful now But as babies
I never imagined such ugly faces-

A GUN SHOT breaks everything and echoes back from the
hillsides We circle around with them and watch the rest of
the scene from their vantage

The crowd clears leaving Acre and Bill alone standing a

couple meters apart Bill holds a PISTOL Acre holds the
cooler tight to his chest Another GUN SHOT tears up the

ground between them

Amanda grabs Elijah from Caroll which is a struggle because of
Carolls shock

Acre seems disconnected from this moment We hear a faint

ACRE
No

Bill raises the pistol towards Acre With more force

ACRE
No

Bill approaches Acre who flinches but stands his ground
Bill pries one of Acres hands away puts the gun in it and
yanks on the cooler again

BILL
Trade

He steps away unsuccessful frustrated Acre holds the gun in
his lifeless hand stunned Bill turns back

BILL
Ill give it back Trade

CLOSE ON Acre tries to make sense of this

CUT TO SPECTRUM The colored lines and flares are too many
to count now extending all along the middle strip of the
screen

INT SIZZLER PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Eric and Jennifer are having the cheapest wedding reception on
record Theyre getting tired of kissing for the cameras

Down the long string of tables Amanda cuts up a burger for 2-
year old Elijah while Acre looks on unsettled He scans the
room finds Caroll Leslie and a few others standing around
the drink station

LESLIE
and all these dates come pouring out
We thought they were arbitrary but each
event occurs at night no matter the
location and under a new moon Measured
from the day we found the numbers

LESLIES ASSISTANT
Whats amazing ishow could it know when

CAROLL

(knowingly)
How could what know

LESLIE
Hmm

Acre has walked up behind them agitated

ACRE
What was that

They turn not understanding the question

ACRE
He said how could what know and you

this as relics being found without
considering the source

An AIDE walks into the chamber through DOUBLE DOORS

An older clean-shaven Acre sits behind the rostrum an
assemblyman now in the middle of a spirited debate with

someone at the lectern While he speaks his SECRETARY places

a NOTE in front of him

ACRE
I I I understand that uh Mr Jacobs I

Caroll looks away found out

CAROLL
Ohwhat they always takethese

INT ARCTIC ICE BREAKER CARGO HOLD - NEXT

At a table Acre looks on as Caroll tightens a SHEET OF
PLEXIGLAS against a 3-foot CURVED BACKING He uses a STEEL
REPLICA of the rib bone from years ago as a spacer between the
two

CAROLL
Im finding it harder to blame anybody
anymore Its joyless hunting them
downits half my job They hide them
in safe deposit boxes in
Wisconsincrawlspace of some step-
mothers time-share in Phoenix

He sets the replica aside Acres eyes follow it dwell
Caroll pours AMBER LIQUID from a BLUE-LABELLED THERMOS into
the one-inch gap between the Plexiglas and the backing

ACRE
How about Leo He buried it

CAROLL
Beneath a river bed in Laos
(motioning to a RED THERMOS)
You want to pour that into the reservoir

Acre thinks on it but doesnt even uncross his arms

ACRE
You go ahead

EXT ARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY

10 MEMBERS assisted by 2 SNOWMOBILES push CARGO BOXES on
sleds from the ship to some unknown destination

CUT TO They unpack and assemble the APOLOGUE attaching it to
a LARGE SWIVELING BASE so that it can be rotated and pointed
It looks like an UNWIELDY TELESCOPE

The Apologue points straight up Into the bottom they slide
the Curved Backing that sloshes with Amber Liquid They screw
on the YELLOW THERMOS and use a manual pump to mix the
contents into the backing

They point the Apologue at a precise spot in the sky
NIGHT Leslie addresses the group

LESLIE
Ill say it out loud Everyone all
electronics off no flash photography
heh Find a comfortable spot because
youll be standing there for thirty-five
minutes tonight No movement during the
capture so if you need to nows the time
to go relieve yourself and well get these
lights off in about five minutes

LIGHTS OFF Caroll stares at his watch When the time comes
he nods to

»a man on a LADDER who quickly removes a CAP from the top of
the Apologue

We see what the Apologue sees DARKNESS then a field of
STARS as the cap is removed

The pins of starlight sear HOLES in the Amber as it undergoes
a photochemical process

The STAR FIELD slowly arcs across the screen

BENEATH THE AMBER the stars are etching ARCS in it as the
sky rotates

EXT ALASKAN PIER - DAY
Acre stands at a payphone outside a bait store

ACRE
-half the captures look like theyre in
the southern hemisphere They have all
these locations- theyre gonna be doing
this for ten years Anyway I cant catch
a flight for a couple days so-

AMANDA (PHONE)
And where are you coming

ACRE
In two days Thats the soonest anybody
can get out-

AMANDA (PHONE)
I said where Are you coming to the house
or the hotel

He doesnt have an answer

EXT ALASKAN WILDERNESS RIVERSIDE - NIGHT

The Apologue is set up for another capture Leslie is
panicked screaming orders at two members SENTRY 1 and
SENTRY 2 who are rushing to meet a CANOE crossing the wide
river threatening to land

LESLIE
Head them off Not within a hundred
yards Stop them where they are
Caroll is preparing for the capture

CAROLL
Five seconds Everyone stand still

Acre trying to get a look at the 3 OUTSIDERS in the canoe
goes still like everyone else around the Apologue He looks

over his shoulder to see Caroll nod to the man on the ladder

The cap is removed

Once again we see the starlight cut grooves in the Amber
adding arcs to those from the last capture

Caroll and Acre watch the Sentries question the Outsiders far
away at the shore They listen to the conversation on the
radio at Leslies belt

SENTRY 1
How long

Sentry 2 looks through Outsiders BAG
OUTSIDER
Five months What are we looking for Do

you know

SENTRY 2
Everything you have is flat On paper

SENTRY 1
Have you been to Vera Cruz

Outsider looks to his friends not understanding

SENTRY 1
Im sorry

OUTSIDER
What are we collecting

The Sentries push the canoe back into the water with the
outsiders aboard

SENTRY 1
Its not for you Im sorry

OUTSIDER
What is it that weve solved

Acre watches the canoe drift away caught in the current

INT ACRE AND AMANDAS HOUSE - DAY
STAIRWAY Acre half-dressed for work argues with Elijah

ACRE
I dont care if you think your teachers
stupid Eli I dont care if she is
stupid Its laziness Just do the work
and move on

Acre heads toward the kitchen

ELIJAH
Im not lazy

ACRE
No youre just too much like your mom
you gotta argue every goddamn thing

KITCHEN Unpacking groceries Amanda stares at Acre as he
stomps through to the laundry room He searches the dryer
feels her staring turns to her

ACRE
What

CUT TO She follows him to the front door

AMANDA
Then get it all out Take all your shit
with you instead of a little here and
there Ill take you serious when you do
that

ACRE
Done Done Done

AMANDA
Oh I believe it Youre so much talk

ACRE

Really whats that like Amanda I dont
know what it could be like dealing with
empty threats all the time Tell me

AMANDA
You dont know anything about me You
dont know anything

He leaves slamming the door but it bounces off the frame

Amanda heads back Acre re-enters She turns

ACRE
You blocked me in

INT CITY COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

At the front Leslie holds up a CURVED AMBER PLATE for the 40
Members (Caroll Salman etc) in seats to see It has a
LATTICEWORK OF ARCS cut out by the Apologue

LESLIE
Plate 16 All captures taken within a
hundred miles of Mobile over the course of
seven months And as we compare it to
plate 15

PLATE 15 is suspended upright in a METAL FRAMEWORK so that the
audience can see its arcs Leslie and his assistant slide
Plate 16 in front of it

LESLIE
we see that they are similar but with
some subtle differences some evolution
Which is even more pronounced when added
to the first 14 plates

The first metal framework is rolled over to another framework
where 14 PLATES are held Its like a stack of 16 Pringles
laid on its side An ANGULAR ABSTRACT SHAPE (a hexagon cone
with a shaft that tapers to the unfinished end) can be seen
within the amber stack made up of thousands of arcs

LESLIE
we really start to see the shape of
something emergedefining itself by what
it removes and hollows out

MEANWHILE AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM With his briefcase open on
one chair and piles of papers on another two Acre is getting
some city council work done He signs his name in the same
spot on five consecutive pages never looking up at the
demonstration

LESLIE (OFF SCREEN)
Now the question is since we can predict
to a degree of accuracy what our sky will
look like on a given nightcan we
somehow skip all this running around I
dont believe so and I dont believe we
can risk giving the camera anything less
than authentic information the true night
sky

CUT TO Acre turns off the lights and locks up as the last
few members leave the now-empty room

INT ACRE AND AMANDAS HOUSE - LATER

BATHROOM Acre showers in a daze until his attention is
snapped He stares at something in his hand

His palm hovers over the soap dish He picks one of the two
wafer-thin halves of just-broken SOAP and places it in the
dish

HALLWAY He opens the bathroom door in a t-shirt towel-drying
his hair He sees something down the hall watches for a few
seconds and moves to the stairs

Amanda is revealed sitting on the floor next to an open
closet She watches Acre pass and then returns to leafing
through a BOX OF POLAROIDS

ITCHEN Acre pours himself a GLASS of ice water from the
fridge

When he turns around Amanda is standing at the island counter
with the box of pictures She places a few Polaroids down for
him to see and looks to him The pictures are of GLINTS taken
years ago at several different locations In a couple of them
we can see the back of Acres head and baby Elijah

He moves past her and into the next room

STUDY Acre sinks into a leather chair with his drink We
hear Amanda follow him but he continues to fill our view

A Polaroid rises into the right part of the frame Amanda is
showing it to Acre so we only see the back She speaks
quietly and methodically

AMANDA
These streaksI know they arent real
I know its the crummy lens- the long
streaks But if you take

Acre looks directly at us We are Amanda Another Polaroid
rises on the right and overlaps the first a little She holds
them both there with one hand

AMANDA
if you take them and line up the
longest spikes- they have to be turned
around

Acres slowly turns away from the pictures breaking down His
eyes water He shakes his head slightly Another Polaroid
comes up this time on the left

AMANDA
but if we dont do it randomly we only
turn by a certain amount

The Polaroid on the left dips down for a second so Amanda can
pick up a fourth picture before the two return to the frame

Acre watches her guardedly allowing himself for the first
time to consider what she is suggesting

AMANDA
the golden ratio Like science

CUT TO We follow the NOW-EMPTY GLASS Acre holds at his side
as he walks from the study back to the kitchen

He leans against a door post and watches Amanda at the island
counter adding to a MOSAIC of about 15 assembled Polaroids

CUT TO Acre cuts a sandwich in half and gives a part to
Amanda still working

CUT TO Amanda holds Zoe asleep on her shoulder while Acre
cuts up pictures They are deep in discussion about nothing
to do with Polaroids or angles There is even a smile

ACRE
»cause all day Im thinking if I take
little bites from each bag evenly you
know no ones- whos gonna suspect-

AMANDA
No one will ever know

ACRE
Yeah so I get home from school and start
taking them around houses andI mean
they know everybody knows Im knocking
on doors and handing them these bags that
have maybe that much peanut brittle and
the rest is airbecause I retied the-

AMANDA
And they paid you for them

ACRE
They had already So what were they gonna
doidiot kid I never told you that

LIVING ROOM Zoe sleeps on the couch Acre and Amanda
quietly carry a POSTER BOARD containing their work so far to
the wall and prop it up

CUT TO The mosaic has extended far past the poster board
They struggle with one picture turning it this way and that
Acre remembers something hurriedly fishes through the box
with no luck and eventually finds a picture in another pile
They replace the original and it works

n the middle of the room staring at the wall almost angry

She moves to his side

When she turns to the near-complete mosaic her curiosity is
replaced with disappointment

CUT TO Amanda attends to a piece She notices Acre standing
i

ACRE
Its a dead end

THE MOSAIC is revealed beyond them It is almost a mirror
reflection of the room and themselves Where they stand the
rough shape and colors of their clothing and even the
furniture are all reproduced Superimposed over it is what
looks like a WALL OF ABSTRACT VERTICAL LINES The end result
TWO FIGURES FACING A THICK FOREST

CUT TO SPECTRUM We see the entire visible light spectrum
the number of colored lines so dense that the entire strip is
BLINDINGLY WHITE

EXT TREELINE - DAY

Framed identically to the mosaic two boys ALBERT and
CARTER stand in a clearing facing a THICK FOREST
waiting for

EUCLID steps out from the trees carrying something the size
of a large car muffler wrapped in a DIRTY GREEN BLANKET

He lays it on the ground and they crowd around

He peels back the corners of the blanket to reveal a RUGGED
BLACK MACHINE This is the MAKER

NOTE The rest of the story involves 10 BOYS Here are their
names and ages grouped with their friends

(Euclid-10 Carter-12 Graham-7 Samuel-7)

(Albert-11 Marcus-10 Javier-11)

(Vaughn-11 George-11 Hector-9)

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE - NIGHT

BEDROOM Toothbrush in his mouth Euclid pushes and prods
different parts of the Maker which sits on his dresser

CUT TO With some effort he manages to pull out a spring-
loaded TRAY that slides in and out of the machine It ejects
with a JOLT

The tray is empty He starts to push it back in fighting the
springs resistance

CUT TO He pulls and pushes on a ROD that juts out from the
machine The Rod has a YELLOW BUTTON on its end He tries to
push it but it wont go in He inspects some more

LIGHTS OUT

We see the outline of the window frame and Euclid sleeping in
his bed We hear the distinct sound of the TRAY EJECTING

DAWN
The Makers tray is out Euclid peers into it seeing

a WHITE CIRCULAR OBJECT about 10 inches in diameter and 3
inches high with a hole in the middle This is a FUNNEL

He holds it up to the orange sunlight Its slightly
translucent so he is able to see the silhouette of his fingers
moving behind it

He places the Funnel next to the Maker and tries to peer
deeper into the tray opening

ITCHEN He fills a huge WATER COOLER at the sink dumping in
ice

He hears something shuts off the water and listens for a
second before sprinting off

BEDROOM The tray has ejected We hear him running up the
stairs He enters heads straight to the Maker

This time he pulls out a FLAT DISC a few millimeters thick
Its 7 inches wide and like the Funnel has a center hole

Placing it next to the Funnel he compares the two picking at
a LOOSE TRANSLUCENT FLAKE that clings to the Funnel

He pushes the tray in on the Maker and resets it having
mastered the rod and button by now

EXT RURAL HOUSE - LATER

The house sits just off a long country road with the nearest
neighbor a few hundred yards off 5 KIDS are mowing the yard
pruning bushes and edging

Parked on the street is a FLAT BACK TRAILER hitched to a SMALL
WEATHERED TRACTOR The trailer is full of rakes push brooms
and lawn supplies Euclids water cooler sits near the back
He ties a bag of grass closed and pours a cup of water

Vaughn leads George and Marcus to the tractor He gestures to
a rusted gate on the trailers side

VAUGHN
One of you drive but the other one needs
to watch this side gate It already
uhcame loose on me so you might as

well walk alongside and watch all
theshit

He pats his pockets having misplaced something walks off
Carter arrives at the cooler tries to find a cup Euclid
hands him his before heading off While Carter pours a drink
Graham sidles next to him Aggravated

CARTER
What are you doing here

Graham wants something but wont say what He looks around
Carter is forced to continue a previous conversation

CARTER
Graham look at all this stuff You see
all this equipment

At the tractor George moves to climb into the drivers seat
Marcus subtly blocks him by grabbing the gearshift

GEORGE
How old are you

MARCUS
Ten How old are you

GEORGE
Eleven

Marcus moves aside
MARCUS

Okay

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE - LATER
STAIRCASE EUCLIDS SHOES are kicked off at the bottom stair

BEDROOM He enters checks the Maker The tray is closed
He puts his ear to it for a second before heading to the
bathroom

He gets the bathroom door open when we hear the tray eject
He races back

He removes a new Disc from the tray and moves to place it with
the first two pieces on the dresser but sees something there
that causes him to pause

What used to be a Flat Disc has now grown to the same height
as the original Funnel next to it

124 INT CARTERS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Carter is going through some math on paper with Graham

CARTER

Graham
125 EXT COUNTRY ROAD TRAILER - DUS

The kids play with assorted Funnels reclining in the trailer
after a day of work Vaughn drives the tractor that tows them
home at 5 mph

George sits in back spinning his Funnel on its edge like a
top Hector can only watch twirling a still-flat Disc around

his finger absentmindedly It has a BROWNISH STRIPE around
the ring like a coffee stain on white linen

Albert Carter and Marcus are peeling the skin off of theirs
Marcus is able to get a large sheet off It looks like
cellophane He holds it up to the light for everyone to see
Javier walking alongside reaches into Euclids BACKPACK and
retrieves a Funnel Euclid watches but doesnt stop him

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NIGHT

This is a partially constructed building about the size of a
house The walls are concrete with WHITE PLASTIC SHEETS where
windows should be The lumber and tools left by a

construction crew make up the crude furniture

At a desk Albert finishes some payroll accounting and lays out
stacks of cash from a METAL CASHBOX Vaughn oversees

ALBERT
Check it

After a quick glance at the payroll

VAUGHN
Okay

WIDE We now see that the kids are lined up single file in
front of the desk Albert begins distributing the cash to
each after they sign the sheet

Vaughn closes the Cashbox and locks it

CUT TO The kids sit casually in the chairs Some count
their cash Carter stands at the front with Graham

CARTER
My brother wants to mow with us

They all look up

Silence Javier starts counting heads Hector is using his
fingers to do math

MARCUS
We have to split again

CARTER
He went door to door

ALBERT
How many did he get

Graham reads from a NOTEPAD
GRAHAM
Mrs Weist house is on Plackard Street
andthe Reynolds have two colts down the
road from there

ALBERT
Out on farm road

CARTER
We can tractor it takes five minutes

They all think about it looking down or off

GRAHAM
and the Miller house is on Regent
Avenue
They all look up
GRAHAM

It crosses Plackard
They look down to think again

GRAHAM
and the house next door to them

They all look up again
GRAHAM
and the one across the street from that
one its the Clark house They have
three stalls

They continue to stare at him He closes the notepad

EXT CONCRETE FRAME —- DAY

We see kids spinning Funnels on sticks and throwing them like
horrible Frisbees In the distance we can see a CRANE and an
EARTH MOVER on an abandoned CONSTRUCTION YARD

Marcus runs inside

INT CONCRETE FRAME - CONTINUOUS
and across the room to the Maker where he waits on it

Albert and Carter look on as Euclid contends with a STACK of
Funnels he has constructed on the floor They fit on top of
each other perfectly but a half-inch gap separates each

Funnel as if there is some hidden blockage Hes trying to
jam them down with his hands

EUCLID
hey just wontlay flat

ALBERT
They dont fit then

Euclid stands on the Stack balancing himself with a desk

EUCLID
No they fitthey just wont go

The Maker ejects and Marcus takes the new Disc outside The
others are too consumed to notice peeking under and into the
gaps between Funnels

EXT CONCRETE FRAME - CONTINUOUS

Marcus joins Javier on the back step handing him the Disc

Javier compares it to a full grown Funnel in his other hand
He holds them both out in front trying to judge their weight

MARCUS
Thats how they start and then justwhat
are you doing

JAVIER
Nothing

INT JAVIERS HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

Javier is practicing tying a knot learning from a SAILING

MANUAL He holds his place with his left hand and reaches to
operate a VIDEO CAMERA with his right The camera is pointed
at a Funnel in mid-growth placed directly under a desk light

His finger hovers over the RED RECORD BUTTON until
He quickly taps it twice and turns to a SMALL TV to see the

SCREEN go from paused to live for a fraction of second and
then return to its frozen state

EXT WOODS - DAY

Hands slide a Disc into a slim nook in a TREE

EXT JUPITER ROCK - DAY

Jupiter Rock is a boulder the size of an oven It has a
splotch of red discoloration on it

The kids wedge a Disc into a tight crevasse near the top

EXT FARM ROAD - DAY

At a row of THREE MAILBOXES Albert and Marcus slide a Disc
between one mailbox and the post it sits on

EXT CONSTRUCTION YARD - DAY

Climbing on a LARGE EARTHMOVER they place a Disc between the
joints of one of the vehicles lifting arms

INT ALBERTS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

The kids are crowded around a TV captivated by it

Some of them begin humming This escalates in volume and
pitch until the moment they are anticipating arrives and they
accompany it with sound effects foooshhhh etc

ALBERT
One more time

Javier works the REMOTE CONTROL

TELEVISION We see the time-lapse video he shot A Disc does
nothing for a few seconds and then begins to rise slowly A
moment later it speeds up exponentially and shoots into the
Funnel shape like a biscuit rising

EXT WOODS - DAY

The nook in the tree is SPLIT now around the growing funnel

A hand runs over the area as another spurt of SPLINTERING and
CRACKLING comes from the mounting pressure

A few kids look on Vaughn grimaces bracing for something to
come flying at them

EXT JUPITER ROCK - DAY

The crevasse in the rock is FRACTURED and much wider now to
accommodate the Funnels growth

A large portion of SPLIT-OFF ROCK unceremoniously falls to the
ground

EXT FARM ROAD - DAY
One mailbox has been blown off its post and hangs loosely

The other POPS OFF as the kids watch

EXT CONSTRUCTION YARD - DAY

The kids hide behind assorted stacks of bricks and vehicles
like theyre playing war with an invisible enemy Albert and
Carter peek out at the earthmover and then duck back Euclid
sits nearby thinking

Albert checks his watch impatiently

ALBERT
Slipped out

CARTER
Nuh-uh Its in there good Unless
somebody messed with-

Euclid realizes

EUCLID
Theres no light

CARTER
What

Euclid stands up heading toward the earthmover
EUCLID

Its packed way in there It cant get

any sunlight

CARTER
It needs that

EUCLID
Its not going to work

Halfway to the earthmover the SOUND OF CREAKING METAL stops
him He braces not turning around Suddenly the
earthmovers lifting arm BUCKLES and EXPLODES OFF like a
grasshoppers leg attached to a firecracker This sends
Euclid running back to safety feeling stupid

EUCLID
Was that clever

CARTER
I almost followed you

CLOSE-UP Hector eyes something far off with anticipation

EXT EUCLIDS HOUSE BACK PORCH - DAY

We now see Hector is watching Euclid from behind the corner of
the house Euclid is on the steps packing Funnels into his
backpack The Maker sits next to him

When it EJECTS Hector comes running He places his BROWN-
STRIPED DISC on the step next to Euclid

HECTOR
Can I trade This one didnt go

EUCLID
What are you gonna do with it

HECTOR
Nothing

He nervously licks his bottom lip looking at the new Disc in
the tray

EUCLID
Hector what are you gonna do

Euclid looks away signaling his resignation Hector takes
the new Disc Euclid sweeps the Brown Striped one and
everything else into his bag

EXT BRIDGE - NEXT

We follow in front as Euclid walks along the road toward a
bridge that crosses over a small CREEK 30 feet behind him
OLIVIA CARMEN and DAPHNE lazily bicycle toward
the bridge

As Euclid makes a turn and descends below the bridge to walk
along the creek bed he passes the rest of the boys huddled

together against the embankment quietly waiting to ambush the
girls Graham is picking out the perfect EGG from a CARTON

Euclid continues on his way Behind him the girls appear and

the boys unleash a torrent of eggs They all scream and its

mostly fun until Daphnes bike topples over and she ends up in
a ditch

Euclid looks back over his shoulder

The boys stop throwing and just stand there We can hear
Daphne whimpering Carter looks for someone to blame

CARTER
Shit Marcus What are you doing

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

Euclid fishes a Funnel out of his backpack and adds it to the
stack of 4 that already sits on the desk It fits but there
is still a gap between all the Funnels

He takes a seat and places the backpack on the desk rifling
through it Suddenly he notices the stack of 5 Funnels
COLLAPSING One after another they each drop erasing the
gaps between them

When they are completely compact the texture of the Funnels
changes slightly for a fraction of a second like a THOUSAND
TINY HOLES silently flitting open and closed

Then the Stack goes neutral and the GAPS between the Funnels
return

Euclid stares wide-eyed and shocked He suddenly SNEEZES

A delayed reaction he jumps back out of his seat He tears
his eyes off the Stack to check the door behind him about to
speak Did anyone see that

When he slowly takes his seat we follow him down and see that
Samuel has been sitting to his left staring at the Funnel
Stack

SAMUEL
I saw it

Euclid notices him for the first time

He reaches out to carefully lift the top Funnel but when he
does the entire Stack comes with it connected somehow

EXT WOODS - NEXT

Marcus stands on a stack of 3 Funnels By steadying himself
against a tree hes able to spin back and forth while he talks
to Javier sitting nearby

Euclid and Samuel are 100 feet off walking this way Euclid
wears his backpack and carries the 5-Funnel stack by the top
Funnel like a suitcase Marcus steps off and faces them

EXT FIELD - NEXT

Hector and George are playing horseshoes with Funnels 5 are
scattered around

Euclid approaches carrying the Stack that now has 8 Funnels
Samuel Marcus and Javier follow him

They all look on as Euclid places the 8-Funnel stack on top of
one of the scattered Funnels which then retracts into it and
goes neutral now a part of the Stack

Euclid studies the other Funnels until he finds one he thinks
will fit

One by one he picks them all up and then walks off with his
followers

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

The Stack sits on the desk 20 Funnels high now George and
Samuel count the gaps The others look on as Euclid works
removing his backpack and emptying it on the desk Out come
pens papers the Brown-Striped Disc and a 7-inch Funnel

MARCUS (OFF SCREEN)
No he did it himself He figured it out

CARTER (OFF SCREEN)
How

MARCUS (OFF SCREEN)
He knew exactly what he was doing He got
the right pieces and just kept going

Euclid takes the 7-inch Funnel and steps up on a chair to
reach the top of the Stack When he places it there the
entire Stack starts to collapse One by one each Funnel

begins to drop down

SAMUEL and GEORGE stop counting and just watch

GEORGE
Theyre all doing it

Carter steps forward to stand next to Euclid who takes his
eyes off the collapsing Stack just long enough to acknowledge
him before turning back

CARTER
Hey How diduh

Euclid turns to him again

EUCLID
What

The last Funnel contracts and in an instant the entire Stack

SLAMS against the desk with a DEAFENING BANG and disappears

Papers and everything on the desk are sent into the air The
kids all recoil

When they compose themselves they look up to the ceiling

CUT TO The Stack has embedded itself halfway through the
exposed plywood of the first floor ceiling Euclid and Carter
are cutting into the wood with a HAND SAW to free it

Beyond them outside Marcus is explaining to Vaughn and
Albert who have just arrived We cant hear him over the
sawing but what hes saying becomes clear when he smacks his
hands together hard and points at the ceiling

CUT TO

IN THE BACKGROUND Back on the desk Euclid and a few others
remove the last remaining splinters of wood from the Stack
Javier tries to pry the top Funnel off with his hands Vaughn
and Hector jam STICKS into the gaps to get some leverage to
pull them apart

GEORGE
Hes gotta get it off first Albert

ALBERT
How did you get it to work before

GEORGE
Cause they werent stuck Why are you
telling us what to do if you didnt see
it

JAVIER

(still straining)
I need a screwdriver to get under there

HECTOR
Be careful Dont stand over it

Javier gives up and shakes the pain from his cramped fingers

JAVIER
I need a screwdriver

MEANWHILE IN THE FOREGROUND Graham and Samuel are scavenging
the floor and picking up bits that fell off the desk Carter
stands quietly watching the group

Graham finds the Brown-Striped Disc and offers it to him

CARTER
Nuh-uh its a runt It doesnt go

Graham places it on the desk next to the Stack

which begins to collapse again immediately trapping
Javiers shirt between two Funnels

Everyone backs away leaving Javier panicking pulling on his
shirt

The sticks VIOLENTLY SNAP in two as each Funnel drops down
The kids anxiously watch as Javier struggles
DOLLY BACK with Albert as he steps forward to help Javier
DOLLY BACK with Euclid as he steps forward

DOLLY BACK with Vaughn as he steps forward opening a
POCKETKNIFE

DOLLY FORWARD following Carter as he goes to the desk

Albert and Vaughn try to cut the shirt free Euclid holds the
Stack steady Javier gets free just as the last two Funnels
are about to collapse

But they dont collapse surprising everyone One by one the
gaps return and the Stack starts to go neutral

Carter stares at the Stack relieved breathing heavily He
turns to the others

They are all staring just past him at
THE BROWN-STRIPED DISC (now called the Controller) held

high in the air in Carters hand as far away from the Stack as
he can get it

Carter turns to it as well

EXT FIELD — NEXT

With much apprehension a hand slowly brings the Controller
closer to the Stack which now stands on a small ALTAR of
random lumber When it is within a couple feet the Stack
starts to go compact and as it gets closer the collapsing
speeds up

EUCLID
Everybody clear andwatch out

»until the Controller is within inches and the Stack
suddenly EXPANDS HARD and launches up The recoil jolts the
pile of 2X4s like a whack from a sledgehammer

WIDE The kids are arranged in a rough semi-circle around
Euclid and the altar Their heads quickly turn to the sky to
follow the Stack fast as a bottle rocket

Shielding their eyes from the sun they follow the arc for a
few seconds A couple of them step forward like they’re about
to chase down a pop fly Their pace quickens and soon the
entire group follows at a sprint

Vaughn comes to Euclids side at the back of the pack

VAUGHN
Euclid what are you going to do with the
rest of them

Euclid’s attention is still on the Stack’s arc He’s
surprised that Vaughn’s isn’t

EUCLID
What

VAUGHN
When it makes more are you going to use
them or

CUT TO Albert and Vaughn stand facing Euclid 20 meters
beyond them the others hang over a HIGH CONCRETE WALL looking
into another section of the abandoned construction

ALBERT
(to Euclid)
What do you think

VAUGHN
Now that we know what it does-

Vaughn goes quiet as Albert places a hand on his shoulder

ALBERT
Maybe we should all get onenow that we
know what it does

The three turn to the wall as Carter retrieves the Stack
pushing it back over to the other kids

INT CONCRETE FRAME BACK STEP — DUSK

Euclid is teaching Vaughn and Albert pad and pencil ready
how to use the Maker In the distance Carter and the others
are setting up another launch

EUCLID
Push the button in and pull it

Vaughn pushes the button on top of the rod and tries to pull
it but it wont budge Euclid mimics the motion He can
barely stop himself from reaching in and doing it himself

EUCLID
The button on the thing the rod push it
first You gotta pull hard

VAUGHN
Im pulling

CARTER
(far off)
Three Two One

They all turn to see the launch necks craning to follow the
high arc

Turning back Euclid notices that the ejector tray is out He
pushes it back in

EUCLID
Oh here Now try

The other two turn back to the Maker and this time Vaughn is
able to get the rod pulled out

INT CONCRETE FRAME - MORNING
Euclid and Albert lean against the workbench waiting Euclid
checks his wristwatch and puts his arm down When Albert

twists his head to see the watch Euclid brings it back up for
him

Vaughn arrives He unpacks the Maker and a WADDED-UP T-SHIRT
from his backpack

Euclid takes the Maker and places it in front of Albert who in
turn puts it in his bag Something catches their eye

Vaughn pulls back the four corners of the Wadded-up T-shirt to
reveal EIGHT NEWLY-MADE FUNNELS and ONE DISC

INT ALBERTS HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Albert is sound asleep in his bed The Maker is on the floor
next to the bed The tray ejects hitting the ONOFF BUTTON
on a radio that has been set up in front of it The synthetic
voice of the National Weather Service Hourly Summary blares
from the speaker

In one sleepy but practiced move he rolls over turns the
radio off removes the new Disc drops it on the floor next to
a few Funnels pushes the tray in resets the rod on the
Maker and goes back to sleep

EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

With the others looking on Euclid and Albert each launch
Stacks seconds apart by bringing their Controllers near to
them

EUCLID
Everybody clear andwatch out

ALBERT
One twothree

DUSK

On another part of the field George Carter Graham and
Javier are spread out watching the sky

A Stack drops in landing roughly Then another Then one
more

The kids rush in to pick them up In the distance others
come racing over a hill to meet them

EXT HOUSE FRONT LAWN - DAY

While the other kids are landscaping behind him Hector sits
under a tree completing a stack of 6 Funnels Lunch remnants
surround him He brings the Controller to the Stack and it
begins collapsing

Carter arrives drops a WEED EATER next to him and starts
picking up the trash

CARTER
One lunch is over Everybody else
noticed but you

Hector sneezes and quickly gets up Carter gestures to the
weed eater

CARTER
Two you jammed this and Im not spending
an hour untangling it

HECTOR
I didnt know how to open it
CARTER
Why are you even here Wheres Allie
HECTOR
Im here instead
CARTER

Did he pay you

Hector picks up his Stack and points at the top two Funnels

HECTOR
These two here

CUT TO Euclid and Carter stand on the trailer collecting
rakes and bags of grass as the others bring them in

CARTER
You didnt charge Allie to use the maker
did you

EUCLID
Nuh-uh

CARTER

And he turns around
They step away to pile the bags and then return to camera

EUCLID
Thats not fair

CARTER
Nuh-uh

EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

Graham and Samuel pack a TOY PARATROOPER on the top of a Stack

and back away waiting for Euclid to launch it Hes
finishing a conversation with Albert

ALBERT
I just figured as long as Carter and
Graham get theirs right And Sammy
Then you know

EUCLID
Well Im not gonna charge anyone soif
the other guys ask me they can have them

for free
ALBERT

Okay yeah But I get the Maker Sunday
EUCLID

Its your turn yeah Do whatever you

want
He turns to launch the Stack

EUCLID (CONTD)
All right everybody clear and

The Stack starts to collapse even though he is a good 10 feet

away Euclid not noticing turns back to Albert
EUCLID
But doesnt it seemI dont know the
word Disrespectful maybe or
Euclid stops talking as he realizes
He turns to the Stack to see it has completely collapsed
Puzzled he steps back a few steps and waits
ALBERT

Disrespectful to who Its a lot of work
running the thing every-

Albert keys off Euclid and also turns to the Stack
which eventually goes neutral
Euclid standing still speaks in a monotone testing

EUCLID
All-right-everybody-clear-and

The Stack collapses from 15 feet away
He checks Albert and then the Controller in his own hand

ALBERT
Dont you have to be closer

Euclid pushes the test further

EUCLID
All-right-everybody-clear-and-watch-out

The Stack launches even though the Controller is nowhere near
it It has less power this time only jumping 40 feet high

ANOTHER DAY
ALBERT seems amused He leans forward and WHISPERS

ALBERT
One twothree

WIDE Albert holds the Controller loosely at his side and is
several feet away from the Stack It launches just a few feet
in the air and falls on its side

He laughs The kids watching love it

100 FEET AWAY A CIRCLE on the ground 20 feet in diameter and
made of branches and rocks is almost complete Javier and
Carter put the final rocks in place

BACK AT THE LAUNCHING AREA Albert Vaughn and Euclid fasten
a few RED BRICKS to the top of each of three Stacks as

Hector tries to launch his from a distance without success

HECTOR
Four three two go

He gives up and goes to the Stack holding out his Controller

HECTOR
How many times do I have to do this

SAMUEL
Itll learn

CUT TO Concentrating Vaughn speaks at a normal volume and
tries to accurately enunciate the last word

VAUGHN
Ready get set toFLY

AT THE TARGET CIRCLE Two Stacks have landed inside A third
drops next to them nose-first weighed down by the bricks

CUT TO Javier measures the distance from the center of the
circle to one Stack with a length of string He compares it
to the next Stacks distance

JAVIER
Vaughn got it

The kids all laugh and boo and comment about who won Vaughn
gloats

VAUGHN
I dont knowI cant teach you that

EXT DIRT ROAD - DUSK

Hector and George pull a SMALL WAGON carrying SOMETHING
covered in a sheet The sheet falls off from too much
jostling revealing an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR like one used in
school

George quickly hides it back under the sheet and checks to
make sure no one saw
INT CONCRETE FRAME - NIGHT

Javier peels a sheet of Skin off a Funnel and carefully places
it on the overhead projector

The kids are spaced throughout the room in little nests of
SLEEPING BAGS and SNACKS One by one they each look up with
interest at the projected image on the wall

It contains a series of ABSTRACT SHAPES connected by a network
of tunnels

CUT TO Javier Marcus and Graham trace the network on the
wall with MARKERS

Albert and George trade ideas in full problem solving mode
gesturing to one of the Shapes

IN THE BACK Euclid and Carter sit in their sleeping bags
studying a single Funnel Unlike the others this one is
CRACKED BROWN and a bit TRANSLUCENT

CARTER
is it used up

EUCLID
I dont know it has all these um

CARTER
Howd you get it off

Vaughn crawls over seeing the Funnel

EUCLID
See thats the thing it just-

VAUGHN
What happened to it

They are interrupted by some commotion at the front wall

HECTOR

Oh my god that works Hes right
JAVIER

Show me again
HECTOR

I just did it by myself and it works
Marcus you gotta show everybody

MARCUS
You just take the number of-

JAVIER
Wait for everyone just a sec

Carter and Euclid approach the front as everyone crowds around
Marcus ready to learn the secret He gestures to the
projected image his excitement contagious

MARCUS
Okay all these shapes have sides right
and if you count them uh you have

JAVIER
Do the one you just showed us

MARCUS
Okay yeah this onehas four sides so
A B C DD is the fourth letter so
this is D

He draws a D on the wall and points to the next shape
MARCUS

And this one has one twonine sides
So Sammydo it
SAMUEL (COUNTING HIS FINGERS)

Its al
MARCUS

Right and this is seven letters so
HECTOR

G
MARCUS

Yeah so this is Dig And dont ask me

what it means yet

Euclid is let down He studies the shapes on the wall

JAVIER
What are some other ones
MARCUS
I dont know yet we have to do the rest

of them
Everyone starts counting letters Euclids suspicious

EUCLID
None of these shapes has more than13
sides

Marcus looks to the wall verifying

MARCUS
Uh-huh

EUCLID
Dont you need some to have 26 sides if
they were letters

MARCUS
Yeah but only if theres a Z in the word
Barely any words have Zs

George whispers to Hector

GEORGE
Thats trueor Xs or Ws

Euclid quietly checks everyone to see if they are going
this They are all studying the wall and writing their
decryptions

EUCLID
How do you know the words arent Spanish
then

for
own

Hector tries to help by whispering to Marcus

HECTOR
Dig is English

Marcus acknowledges but doesnt repeat it Instead

MARCUS
You dont have to agree Euclid

Albert interrupts Hes enthusiastic
ALBERT
What order do the shapes go Left to
right or can it be up and down

Euclid can’t believe Albert is buying this

EXT CONCRETE FRAME BACK STEP - LATER

Euclid sits working on a Funnel Stack Everyone else can be
seen still inside Carter sits down next to him

CARTER
It didnt really work

EUCLID
(sarcastic)
What

Euclid looks back across the room as others are leaving Marcus
alone at the projector He looks back at Euclid with some
embarrassment contempt before getting back to his work

EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

Hector looks on as George triggers what should be an
uneventful launch but as the Stack leaves the ground it
splits in half one part flying into the trees and the other
spinning across the ground

CUT TO At the edge of the woods they inspect one half The
bottom Funnel shows some cracking and is brown and

translucent

HECTOR
It just looksold

George feels the texture of it worried
We follow Vaughn as he arrives wearing a STRING OF FUNNELS

around his torso like a bandolier

HECTOR
We can play with mineyou want to try
mine

GEORGE
No

Vaughn pulls out PLIERS and goes to work on the Stack
HECTOR
What are you doing Youre not gonna be
able to
With some effort Vaughn slides out the Aged Funnel He
compares it to the Funnels on the string until he finds
that matches and tosses the old one to the side

VAUGHN
You got three dollars

George stunned shakes his head no

Vaughn jams a new Funnel into the Stack and brings the
Controller in Georges hand close to it

VAUGHN
Can you work Saturday

George nods watching the Funnel retract

EXT FIELD LANDING AREA - DAY

one

Euclid carries a Stack in each hand returning them to the

launching area far uphill Behind him Samuel and Graham are

chasing down a descending Toy Paratrooper

He suddenly turns towards the woods like someone has called

his name But no one is there He gives up turning again up

the hill and sees

Carter is talking to Olivia and Daphne who are sitting on
their bikes Olivia is removing her necklace (a thin strip of

leather with some charms on it) Carter hands a small Funnel

to her pulling it back at the last second Flirting

Eventually he lets her loop the necklace through the Funnel

and she puts it back around her neck

CUT TO We follow Euclid as he approaches Carter Olivia and

Daphne are gone

Euclid stands up one Stack in front of Carter and moves to
MILK CRATE full of Funnels assorted by size

CARTER
Thanks
EUCLID
Theyre all here
CARTER
Yeah
EUCLID
How do you know did you count them
CARTER

No How many should we have

Again SOMETHING from the woods snags Euclids attention
Carter turns too

EUCLID
I dont know Maybe we should mark them

They head into the trees to investigate

EXT WOODS - NEXT

We hear BANGING Euclid and Carter come upon some kids
huddled around

Marcus hacking away at a White Funnel with a HAMMER

EUCLID
Marcus lets not do that all right

Vaughn picks the Funnel up off the ground
VAUGHN
Look at that its not doing anything
Carter you should try

Carter takes the Funnel and studies it

CARTER
Only if Euclid wants me to

VAUGHN
Dont you want to see whats in there
MARCUS
I do
ALBERT
Me too
VAUGHN

Yeah thats three already

Carter and Euclid just stare at them for a few seconds before
turning to each other in low tones

CARTER
It doesnt matter These are all yours
Ill beat down whoever says theyre not
especially Vaughn And it doesnt count
anyway cause not everybodys here so-

EUCLID
No Its a vote

Carter takes a second to be sure announces to the others
CARTER
Ill get my dads hammerand I want a
fresh one right out of the Maker

INT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

The Maker ejects a Disc Samuel grabs it runs out

EXT JUPITER ROCK - DAY
»and sets it up on the large rock

Carter raises a SLEDGEHAMMER and brings it down as hard as he
can

The Disc ricochets into the trees

CARTER
I bent it

The boys fan out to look for it
EUCLID
You bent the rock

CARTER
No I bent it I felt it

From deep in the brush

JAVIER
Here it is

CUT TO Euclid holds it up in the sunlight for inspection

EUCLID
I dont know I dont see any-

CARTER
I felt something move

Euclid hands the disc to Carter
EUCLID
Its already rising
EXT CONSTRUCTION YARD - DAY

We hear an ENGINE running Carter holds a LARGE METAL HOOK
that hangs from above He waits on

the Maker attended by Samuel It ejects and he quickly
hands over the Disc to Carter who hurriedly loops a length of
STEEL CHAIN through it and hangs the Disc on the metal hook

CARTER
All right go

WIDE Vaughns TRACTOR connected to the steel chain idles
on top of a 5-foot-tall PALLET OF BRICKS where we now see
Carter Samuel and the Maker are as well On the side a RAMP
of several stiff boards was used to get the tractor up there
Vaughn sends the tractor off the edge of the brick pile

It in turn strains the Disc hung on what we now see is the end
of a LARGE CRANES steel cable The cable and chain go taut
as the tractor swings a few feet off the ground

Everyone waits The tractors engine makes the only noise
Carter stares at the Disc with anticipation Then decides
He jumps down off the bricks grabs a bit of the tractors
chain and starts pulling down

CARTER
Hurry up

The others join him each grabbing some chain except for
Euclid who watches from the side taking a few steps back

CARTER
Come on pull

Euclid looks from the kids to the Disc above them He smiles
just a bit admiring its strength

Suddenly something in the line SNAPS The engine noise
immediately goes QUIET

The tractor CRASHES to the ground IN SILENCE The kids all
fall to the ground like they won a tug-of-war again with no
sound

We hear the sound of PARTICLES HITTING A WALL and nothing
else

As Carter and the others get up they instinctively edge away
from the tractor afraid

Albert hits the side of his ear mouthing something

Samuel nervously checks everyones face turning from person
to person He cant hear

Vaughn shapes his hands around his head making a pathway to
scream in his own ear

Euclid looks from kid to kid assessing damage

MATCH CUT TO

INT CONCRETE FRAME —- DAY

He sits against a wall still scanning the others landing on
Hector sitting next to George screams as loud as he can into
his ear Nothing George laughs motions for Hector to turn
his own ear and returns the favor They couldnt be more
amused

Euclid isnt He turns to

Carter and Albert have just finished writing on a board in big

letters Dont tell with a list of the boys names underneath
and a checkbox next to each

Euclid checks the box next to his name and walks off Carter
watches him go

INT SAMUELS HOUSE - NIGHT

KITCHEN More particles and silence Samuel sits at a small
table picking at a piece of bread He keeps his head down but
out of the corner of his eye watches his FATHER preparing
something at the counter with his back to us

Suddenly Father half turns to Samuel waiting for an answer

Samuel looks around his father for clues Hesitantly he nods
and mouths

SAMUEL
Yessir

Father walks over with a PAN and places a small slice of
LASAGNA onto Samuels plate

DEN On the couch Samuel leans against his Fathers arm
watching TV He checks his Fathers expression and then
pretends to laugh at the show at the right places

INT HECTOR AND GEORGES HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

Carrying GLASSES of milk and BOWLS of macaroni and cheese
Hector and George take seats on the carpet in front of the TV
Cartoons are on

Hector pushes a combination of buttons on the remote but when
he looks to the TV doesnt seem to be getting the effect he
wants He puts the remote in Georges outstretched hand

With a couple presses George turns on closed captioning

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE - NIGHT

KITCHEN Euclid puts a dirty dish and glass in the sink and
grabs a POPSICLE from the freezer His mother sits at the
table going through a pile of papers (bank statements etc)

As Euclid makes his way to the hall his mother says something
without looking up He stops studying her After a moment
he slowly resumes walking

STAIRWAY At the bottom of the stairs Euclid in socks
walks past his SHOES lying on the floor Beyond him in the
kitchen his mom looks up from her work and watches him go
upstairs Agitated she gets up

EUCLIDS ROOM Euclid closes the door and locks it He
steadies himself with his hand against the bed and begins the
balancing act of removing his pants while eating the popsicle

Behind him the door knob is being turned violently from the
other side This is followed by the door itself vibrating
from being pounded on

He lays on the bed finds his place in a SAILING PHOTOBOOK

Suddenly the door swings open His mom enters still holding
the METAL CLOTHES HANGER used to unlock it Enraged and a
little scared she yells something while motioning to the door
with the clothes hanger She waits for an answer

His eyes flit around panicked He cautiously moves past her
with an idea

STAIRWAY EUCLIDS HANDS pick the shoes up off the floor at
the bottom of the stairs

He passes his Mother on the way back upstairs and watches her
over his shoulder to make sure he got it right

LATER
BLACK

Euclid flips on the lamp next to his bed He has kicked off
the covers and has been lying there sweating

He wipes a face full of sweat into his pillow and gets out of
bed Rain is hitting the window

BATHROOM Euclid gulps downs a paper cup of water and
immediately refills it

EUCLIDS ROOM Carefully balancing his cup of water Euclid
moves down the hall to his bedroom doorway where he suddenly
halts seeing

Carter is in his room closing the window Next to him is
Albert removing a backpack They are soaked in rain Albert
looks to Euclid

CUT TO The three sit on the floor Albert produces a
THERMOMETER from the backpack puts a DISPOSABLE PLASTIC COVER
on it and hands it to Euclid

Euclid puts it under his tongue Carter shows him his

he releases it the rock arcs over the Dry Circle and takes
the twine with it

CUT TO On the other side of the Dry Circle Euclid pulls the
twine which is tied to two pieces of rope This drags the
rope (and the flag behind it) through assorted construction
yard obstacles to the center of the circle

CUT TO Carter and Vaughn each pull a length of rope tied to
the flag carefully scooping up the Disc Fragments with it

Albert and Euclid pull the other two ropes folding the other
end of the flag over the Disc Fragments wrapping them up

FROM FAR ABOVE We follow them as they approach the man-made
seemingly BOTTOMLESS HOLE about 30 feet in diameter Whatever
this was it was never completed another abandoned part of
some large scale project

ropes are pulled to empty the contents

The fragments fall into the dark void

INT VAUGHNS HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY

Vaughn sleeps on the couch in what looks like the least
comfortable position imaginable We hear GOLF ANNOUNCERS on
the television For a while the sound is relatively quiet
someone teeing up Suddenly the crowd CHEERS LOUDLY

Eyes still closed Vaughn grabs the nearby REMOTE and holds
down the VOLUME - button until the sound disappears

Seconds pass
He opens his eyes intently He turns the volume up

TV The on-screen announcers go on about what an incredible
drive it was narrowly missing a sand trap

THE COUCH is now empty except for the remote the CUSHIONS
slowly inflating back to their normal shape
EXT VAUGHNS HOUSE - NEXT
The SCREEN DOOR bangs open and Vaughn comes running out
shoving his shoes on as he goes A DOG in the next yard over
barks at him repeatedly He barks back excitedly

Rark rark
EXT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT
He races toward the building

VAUGHN
Hector Allie

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT
He enters the room and seeing his friends announces

VAUGHN
Its gone

His enthusiasm dies as he scans the room from face to face

REVERSE ANGLE The others look on as Carter and Albert argue
silently pointing at diagrams on the board They seem
unaware of Vaughns presence

Javier mouths something from across the room and they all turn
to him Then Euclid interjects using his fingers to list 3
things This all happens in total silence

VAUGHN
Hello Hello

He gets no response but eventually the others stop arguing
and notice him Carter says something directly to him but
there is no sound

VAUGHN
I dont

They look at him puzzled Vaughn looks down searching for a
reason

VAUGHN
WhyI waswe were all together

From one side of the room Albert accidentally knocks a MARKER
off a table It makes a loud SMACK as it hits the floor
jolting Vaughns attention He watches it roll across the
floor with the appropriate sound and then looks to Albert

who avoids his gaze and tries to hide a smile Carter
punches Albert in the shoulder

A quiet moment passes Vaughn is even more puzzled A
stifled laugh comes from the other side of the room Vaughn
turns to see where it came from when Marcus jumps on him puts
him in a headlock and screams

MARCUS
Goddamnit Albert That was gonna be so
good

Others pile on Vaughn laughing

VAUGHN
Hello
EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

Javier hits the record button

JAVIER (CONTD)
Okay go

CUT TO Now Javier is recording George launching a Stack

GEORGE
Ready Set Jump up

The Stack hops a few feet up Javier stops the recording

JAVIER

EXT TOOL SHED - DAY

Euclid puts away a mower looks over to

20 feet away Albert sits on the ground replacing a Funnel on

a Stack divided into two sections Marcus stands in front of

him pointing at something on the ground Albert picks up the

Aged Funnel and holds it up this

Marcus reaches for it Albert playfully throws it over

Marcus head and it lands behind him He finds it in the tall
grass and cleans it off

Meanwhile behind him this conversation is
Vaughn and Graham clean RAKES with a hose

VAUGHN
Everything needs electricity
GRAHAM
Not everything
VAUGHN
Like what then
GRAHAM
Lawn mower
VAUGHN

EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

Marcus is again searching the grass for something

setting up a launch watches him

Marcus approaches Samuel who is changing out a Funnel

Euclid

MARCUS
Can I have the used one

SAMUEL
Why It doesnt work

MARCUS
I know I just want-

Out of nowhere Euclid holds out a fresh Funnel to Samuel It
has EUCLIDS INITIALS on it All of them from now on have
initials

EUCLID
Ill give you this if you let me have it
SAMUEL
A new one
EUCLID
Yep
They trade

Marcus moves on to Javier who is also attending to a Stack
nearby Euclid follows and intercepts

MARCUS
Do you need that used one

EUCLID
Javi Ill trade you

Euclid hands Javier a fresh Funnel Javier takes it with some
suspicion

JAVIER
Why

Euclid looks directly to Marcus

EUCLID
I collect them

JAVIER
Okay sure

Javier grabs his used Funnel off the ground and is about to
hand it over when

Marcus holds out a new Funnel offering it to him

MARCUS
Here Ill give you one

Javier hesitates

MARCUS (CONTD)
I asked first

Javier considers this

EUCLID
Two

JAVIER
What

EUCLID

Ill give you two new ones

Javier checks Marcus for a counter offer Marcus scans the
horizon never turning towards Euclid He abruptly walks off

JAVIER
I mean I dont care

Euclid watches Marcus leave and then studies the Aged Funnel
he has just bought

A few SHAVINGS of detritus come off when he rubs it with his
thumb
EXT CONCRETE FRAME BACK STEP - DAY

A WOODWORKING FILE is used to whittle down the remains of an
Aged Funnel

A large CHUNK of detritus breaks off in Euclids hand exposing
an OBJECT embedded inside He wipes it clean

It is a tightly packed grouping of IDENTICAL WHITE ARCS
These will be called PETALS They come apart with some effort
like the ribs of a small rodent

CUT TO Four semi-clean packs of Petals are laid on the step
in between Carter and Euclid Some of the Petals have come
free and are placed on top of their respective packs

EUCLID (OFF SCREEN)
Mine had four

Carter is cleaning off another pack with his fingers He
blows into it and bits of debris fly out

CARTER
Me too

He puts it in Euclids outstretched hand Euclid compares the
pack to a Petal in his other hand

CARTER
Do they go

Euclid shakes the question off still experimenting with them

Carter looks towards the other kids scattered around on the
grass attending to their Stacks

He nudges Euclid to see what he sees thirty feet off

Marcus is trying to get an Aged Funnel from George

George stands shakes his head mouths something and points
to Carter and Euclid He walks in their direction leaving

Marcus behind

After a moment Marcus races to intercept George and offers
him two new Funnels

They trade and Marcus moves off to find another one

Carter looks to Euclid and sees that he is making some
progress He is able to get two Petals to join by touching
them together end to end He strains to pull them apart but
cant

Carter quickly scans the area finally finding Marcus talking
to Hector

CARTER
Hector

Hector and Marcus turn

CARTER
Ill trade you four new ones for it

Marcus immediately walks off
Carter races after him walks at his side antagonizing him

CARTER
What are you doing

Marcus glances at him but has no answer They keep walking

No response

No response

Marcus stops

CAR
How many do you have

TER
How many new ones

Euclid catches up with them
CARTER
Marcus how many new ones do you have to
trade
MARCUS
(muttering)

Nobody can do anything

CARTER
What How many
MARCUS
Seven
CARTER

CARTER

Euclid how many do we have
EUCLID

I dont know It just keeps-
CARTER

MARCUS

Nobody can figure out
Except you guys right

MARCUS
Theres pieces leftover Okay Inside
the old ones Thats it I probably
could have got it myself but now-
CARTER
Were not idiots Marcus We already

MARCUS
I know Carter youre the clever ones

CARTER
Yeah we are And we already know about-

Carter raises his arm to point back at the Concrete Frame
causing Marcus to flinch and duck his head

Seeing this Carter loses his train of thought

CARTER
What are you doing

Marcus embarrassed tries to show some bravery and faces
Carter

MARCUS
Nothing

An awkward beat

EUCLID
(to Marcus)
Whatd you figure out

Carter looks to Euclid puzzled Marcus looks to him too
suspicious Euclid takes on the manner of a curious friend

EUCLID
What is it Is itcool orwhat is it

The anger eventually leaves Marcus face

MARCUS
UmI can show you Let me- Ill show
you

INT STORM DRAIN - DAY

This is Marcus hideout complete with WOODEN CRATES as
furniture and PINUPS of sailing yachts The place is pretty
roomy for kids

Carter and Euclid study SEVERAL ROUGH ASSEMBLIES OF PETALS
that Marcus has put together Some are simple stacks others
are ornate designs that have been fastened together with duct
tape None look functional

Carter traces the edges of one with his finger We can see
his Controller dangling from his neck on some string
CARTER
Is this right

EUCLID
I cant tell

CARTER
Youll get it You dont think this
ishes not smart is he you think

EUCLID
I dont know

CARTER
Youll get it

Marcus brings out a CLOSED CARDBOARD BOX from deep in the
storm drain He sets it on a crate on the other side of the

area He begins to pull at the tattered edges of the box
flaps thinking

EUCLID
This is really great Marcus

Euclid leaves Carter and moves to the cardboard box Marcus
sidesteps to subtly block Euclids access

Euclid faces Marcus directly

EUCLID
I think its a big deal

Marcus has a change of heart and opens the box for him It

contains about 10 Aged Funnels and 10 Petal packs that need
cleaning

EUCLID
You traded for all these

MARCUS
Yeah

Carter looks over his shoulder

CARTER
What is wrong with you No you didnt
You got three of mine and I know we never
traded

MARCUS
Most I did I found a lot of them on the
ground What do you care if I pick em
up
CARTER
I dont care Marcus You can pick up dog
shit if you want I just dont like
people sneaking around and being secr-

EUCLID
(to Carter)
Whatd you do with them Carter

Carter turns to Euclid who is now staring into the cardboard
box

EUCLID (CONTD)
Your dead ones

CARTER
What Chucked emin the woods

Beat Carter hasnt looked in the cardboard box so how

EUCLID
Then how do you know hes got them

CARTER
What are you talking about Theres one
here and two in that box

Euclid pulls two Funnels from the box to show Marcus The
Funnels are inscribed with Carters initials

They both look to Carter puzzled

EXT JUPITER ROCK - DAY

Marcus is standing on the boulder the kids all facing him
He digs into his cardboard box brings out a Petal pack and
raises it above his head

A CONTROLLER is brought out of Samuels pants pocket His
thumb rubs it

ANOTHER CONTROLLER hanging from a string necklace is taken out
from under Alberts shirt

VAUGHN lowers his head and closes his eyes

Marcus scans the group slowly until a RAISED HAND comes into
frame

It is Georges He opens his eyes and almost seems surprised
to see his hand up He checks the Controller clutched tight
in his other hand

CUT TO

picking away at the detritus still on

Javier raises his hand and walks down
Marcus lays the Funnel down for him and begins
This time it belongs to Albert

ALBERT

SAMUEL
(excited)
Red schooner

Albert slaps a TINY DIECAST BATTLESHIP into Samuels hand and
heads to the front door

ALBERT
Doesnt work

He opens the door revealing TWO COPS and an OLD MAN arriving
on the porch The Old Man holds a dented MAILBOX

INT ALBERTS HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Albert sits at the table across from one of the Cops and the
Old Man His PARENTS and the other Cop lean against the
kitchen counter and Samuel and Graham stand at the wall behind
him The Cashbox sits on the table next to him

ALBERT
That mailbox did not cost seventy-five
dollars

No one responds Albert makes a motion like there thats my
stance

Another moment of silence He finally caves angry He
produces a KEY from the string necklace under his shirt and
opens the Cashbox

ALBERT
Be sure to get the best one they- get a
gold one yeah With lights anda big

He begins dealing out a stack of bills on the table
flustered

ALBERT (CONTD)
I hope it rusts

INT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

Javier wearing headphones sits at a bench operating his tape
recorder and a JAM BOX He presses down on their buttons at
the same time doing a tape-to-tape edit We hear a 1-second
clip of George speaking his launch command jump up He
continues editing and we hear Albert and then Javier himself
say their launch commands This repeats over and over

The PLASTIC SHEETS have been pulled up so we can see outside
where the other kids are spread out on the grass each working
on their Petals using crates and piles of bricks as tables

As we continue to hear Javiers editing

EXT CONCRETE FRAME BACK STEP - CONTINUOUS

Samuel looks on as Hector tests two Petals he touches them
together just for an instance before separating them He does
it again Its a game like playing with magnets He tries
one last time but the Petals touch for too long and are now
connected He smiles at Samuel as he tries to pry them apart

EAVESDROP Marcus George and Albert work together using
duct tape to crudely fashion together groups of Petals into
the shape of Funnels They stack these like the Funnel
Stacks George holds his Controller out in the hope of making
it jump but it doesnt work

EUCLID half-heartedly works with a few Petals but mainly
watches everyone else from the corner of his eye He sees

Carter and Hector have arranged Petals in the shape of taco
shells and are attempting to stack them In order to get the
top shell on they have to clumsily spread it apart

Euclid puts the Petals down and reaches into his bag to
retrieve a COFFEE CAN He places it on the crate in front of
him and considers opening it

Next to him GRAHAM is assembling Petals on his own
rearranging a few of them over and over systematically He
gets frustrated when a piece doesnt fit like he wants and
tries another

Euclid takes this in

THE COFFEE CAN is lowered to the ground out of sight

INT VAUGHNS HOUSE - DAY

His watch ALARM goes off

VAUGHN

Vaughn and Albert turn back to each other still puzzled
Albert solves it

ALBERT
Oh collateral You said collateral

He drops into the chair

VAUGHN (CONTD)
I mean its not magic

REVERSE ANGLE Euclid Carter and Albert stare at Vaughn
They stand behind the table where the Maker sits

Euclid and Carter watch him go

EXT ALBERTS HOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT

Albert and Marcus lay under a row of leafy vegetables Albert
sifts SOIL into a GRATING built into the top of the Maker

They both press their ears to the Maker

CUT TO Albert dumps out the soil by turning the Maker over
and shaking it

INT ALBERTS HOUSE KITCHEN PANTRY - NEXT

They sit on the floor OPEN BOXES of cereal rice flour etc

MARCUS

I dont know Maybe not Sorry

EXT CONCRETE FRAME BACK STEP - DAY

Vaughn sits at a table selling New Funnels from his box
Graham peers over the table watching

GRAHAM
Why are they so much now

Javier puts an Aged Funnel and some money on the table
Vaughn handles the Aged Funnel

VAUGHN
You sure you want to trade this

JAVIER
Why not They dont jump Im
shortfifty cents

VAUGHN
Thats all right Let me write it down

Vaughn writes in a notebook

GRAHAM
But why are they so much now

VAUGHN
Theres not anymore left after this

This answer occupies Graham just long enough for Vaughn to
pull a New Funnel from the box and give it to Javier

GRAHAM
So what

EXT FIELD LAUNCHING AREA - DAY

George has a Stack ready to launch He is resting against hi
BACKPACK staring into the sky He looks to the far away
target and then makes a slight adjustment to the Stack Hes
in no hurry

Some kid off screen yells something at him from far away He
responds

GEORGE
No

He takes his time brushing some dirt off one of the Funnels
before sitting back again The off screen kids yells again

GEORGE
When Im ready

GEORGE
Yeah and then they wear out and its
wasted What do you care

GEORGE
Are you going to buy me- do you have five
dollars What

GEORGE
Do you have fi- then shut up
INT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

Hector is removing some Petals that are part of the fake duct
taped funnel stack George doesnt want him to

Ss

GEORGE

Why
HECTOR
I need to get my pieces out
GEORGE
What about this though Were not done
yet
HECTOR

I like his plan better now He knows how
to do it I think

George looks worriedly to Vaughn who is across the room
assembling an elaborate TUBE made of Petals

HECTOR
Besides his doesnt use tape

CUT TO Hector now helps Vaughn attach Petals They tie
ROPES through the bigger pieces to make them stay together
Samuel investigates

SAMUEL
How far will it shoot

HECTOR
Maybe a thousand feet

Samuel points to end of the tube

SAMUEL
Comes out of here
HECTOR
Yep anything you can fit in there
probably
(to Vaughn)

You think itll shoot anything Not just
funnels right

Vaughn nods

Euclid watches this from a table at the back of the room

despondent He leans over to Graham who is stilling trying to

construct something without success

EUCLID
Why not put that next to that one

GRAHAM
Like this

EUCLID
Yeah but backwards and then this one
would goyeah
Euclid smiles with some hope

GRAHAM
Ill see if they need it

He heads off to the others with it Euclid opens his mouth to
stop him but its too late

Disappointed he looks at the Petals jumbled before him He
takes another look at the others working and makes a decision

He grabs a few Petals and begins connecting them He knows
exactly what hes doing The speed increases

WIDE We see the entire room with everyone scattered around
talking No one notices Euclid at the back working

LOW DOLLY IN to Euclid He is quickly and purposefully
ssembling SOMETHING connecting tens of Petals We pass
veryone until he is the only one in frame The chatter in
he room slowly disappears

tO WwW

n

LOW DOLLY OUT from Euclid revealing that the other kids are
now turned towards Euclid silent He continues working

THE PETAL ASSEMBLY is cylinder-shaped and from above looks
like it has spokes like a bicycle wheel When Euclid connects
the last Petal the spokes turn in with a jolt directly
towards the center This is a FLOWER

Euclid empties the contents of his coffee can on the table
two more fully-assembled Flowers

He connects these Flowers to the new one by sliding them
inside each other This is a Flower Limb He sets it down
and watches as everyone gathers at the table putting their
hands on the Flowers trying them out

With some force they can be slid in and out like a telescope
and when they are extended one Flower can spin on top of
another

Something catches Euclids attention at the door

Albert stands at the entrance We follow him to the table as
the others make a path

Euclid watches him lean down and rotate the top Flower He
speaks in a low tone to no one in particular

ALBERT
I know what it eats

EXT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

Marcus and Albert stand next to the Maker The others are
crowded around Marcus speaks formally like hes delivering a
speech

MARCUS
We know what to feed it So heres how
thisll work every week-

CARTER
What is it

MARCUS
Were not gonna tell

Euclid puts his ear to the Maker and listens

GEORGE
They dont know

HECTOR
Theres no way

Euclid circles around He and Albert share a look while the
others talk

MARCUS
Every week you give us the Maker Well
make our own funnels and we return it all
gassed up and ready for you

GRAHAM
Its gas I bet it runs on gas He said it
already

Alberts watch alarm goes off

VAUGHN
Its not gasoline is it

Albert turns to Vaughn

ALBERT
Im not telling you anything

HECTOR
Cause he doesnt know

The Maker ejects A Funnel is in the tray

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Samuel and Graham play with a couple Flower Limbs With all
their might they collapse and stretch them apart like
accordions A desk lamp on the floor next to them is their
only light

Euclid and Carter lay on the floor studying the Maker with a
FLASHLIGHT Euclid wipes the Grating with his finger

EUCLID
Whatever he feeds it has to fit through
this thing

Euclid studies his finger but doesnt see anything

CARTER
Like a liquid

EUCLID
Its not gasoline

CARTER
It would smell

EUCLID
Yeah

Carter sees something above them

CARTER

Turn off the flashlight Graham turn off

that light

They do Carter and Euclid study the ceiling where a SPLASH
OF LIGHT is dancing around Their eyes turn to the window

CUT TO Carter and Euclid stand at the open window Beyond
them on the ground Olivia looks up at them waiting She
holds a FLASHLIGHT

EUCLID
You tell her you were here

CARTER
I guess she guessed

OLIVIA
(whisper yelling)
Im thirsty

EUCLID CARTER
We heard you We know

CARTER
Im going down You coming

Euclid hesitates They look down to Olivia and see that
Graham is walking out to her balancing a TALL GLASS of water
TWO GIRLS jump out from the bushes and obliterate him with
WATER BALLOONS

Euclid and Carters legs race past Samuel still playing with
his Flower Limb He puts it down and follows them

The Limb continues to flex expanding and contracting on its
own

EXT EUCLIDS HOUSE YARD - NEXT

Carter Graham Samuel chase Carmen around with a water
balloon They finally get a hold of her She tenses up and
closes her eyes as Carter is about to slam her in the face
with the balloon Instead he squeezes it over her head until
it pops drenching her

Euclid watches this from near the porch

DAPHNE
To borrow

He looks to Olivia and Daphne nearby Olivia is untying her
LEATHER NECKLACE

OLIVIA
No to have I didnt really want it
anyway
She gets it off pulling the Funnel out from under her shirt

DAPHNE
Will you tie it on

Euclid watches as the Funnel goes to Daphnes neck and Olivia
ties it on

DAPHNE
Im addicted now I think Id give you a
thousand bucks for a cigarette if you had
one

Olivia mouths something to Euclid He pulls his attention
from the Funnel and struggles to get what shes saying She
clears it up when Daphne leaves

OLIVIA
She doesnt smoke

Euclid doesnt want to talk

EUCLID
I dont know herso

OLIVIA
She tried last week just once and
gaggedbut she wishes-

Euclid turns to confer with Carter
EUCLID
-hell just sell the funnels and make

CARTER
Maybe

They both look to Vaughn Vaughn answers with a nod
unashamed Euclid and Carter turn back to each other

EUCLID
And Albert feeds it which is sorta

CARTER
Yeah thats like a payment

EUCLID
Yeah so thats not fair to him if I
justgive it to one person and-

CARTER
Not fair to Allie

Carter turns to Vaughn
CARTER
We cant give it to you for free
EUCLID
No way
CARTER
but if you dont- if he doesnt get it
from us

Carter looks off He takes his gum out picking a speck of
dirt out of it before putting it back in his mouth

EUCLID
Alberts gonna sell him funnels anyway so
he gets cash

Euclid looks off

CARTER
Allie does
EUCLID
Yeah
They think too hard
CARTER

This isamazing
Beat The conversation ends suddenly with

EUCLID
Yeah okay how much

VAUGHN
Twenty for the weekend

EUCLID
Hey we just made twenty dollars

Vaughn splits They are left spaced still thinking about it
Euclid spits out his gum

INT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

WIDE Everyone but Javier sits in their chairs quietly
facing us

At the front Javier sets SOMETHING the size of a chair down
just off screen Everyone turns to the left to look at it

When Javier moves to the opposite side of the stage half
the heads follow him while the rest still stare at the
object

After estimating the right distance from the object Javier
kneels down and draws a 2-foot-wide CIRCLE with CHALK

CUT TO Javier presses the PLAY button on his TAPE PLAYER and
adjusts the volume until we hear the HISS of silence through
the speakers

DOLLY BACK from the chalk circle to reveal the object Javier
had placed on the ground a STOOL with THREE FUNNEL STACKS
affixed to it in place of wooden legs

GEORGE (ON TAPE)
Ready set jump up

One of the Stacks on the Stool flexes slightly causing the
Stool to teeter to one side before settling

ALBERT (ON TAPE)
One two three

Another Stack flexes same result

JAVIER (ON TAPE)
Mark get set go

The last Stack flexes same result
After a moment we hear ALL THREE COMMANDS (Jump Up Three
and Go) at the same time from the Tape Player The Stool

LEAPS straight up about a foot It lands and eventually
settles

The Tape Player continues with an edited sequence of repeated
commands The Stool begins to hop around from Stack to Stack
managing to spin and move a few inches towards the circle
Louder commands for higher hops

Its clearly an inefficient way to travel but as the command
sequence speeds up faster and faster so does the spinning and
eventually the Stool is making its way across the stage

DOLLY ALONG as the Stool moves across to

OVERHEAD The Stool stops almost perfectly inside the chalk
circle as the command sequence ends

Javier hits the STOP button and the hiss dies

WIDE Everyone sits silently with varying levels of shock
Chairs creak

Euclid turns his head to the ceiling with his hand over his
mouth thinking Carter leans forward and stares at the
ground When he looks back up to the Stool it is with
determination He prepares to stand and on his way up

MATCH CUT TO

EXT FIELD - DAY

Vaughns head rises into frame looking into the distance
He wears a NECKLACE of SEVERAL CONTROLLERS

VAUGHN
Bring it up

He glances behind him

VAUGHN (CONTD)
Up Bring it up Its coming

Behind him a wall of RED rises and fills the background
WIDE SNOW covers the ground Everyone wears PARKAS Behind

Vaughn Hector and George are draping a RED BED SHEET between
them They pull it taut until it hangs like a curtain

SOMETHING comes racing toward them It moves and looks like a
dog except the legs are Flower Limbs and its torso is nothing
but a PLYWOOD BOX This creature is a CHORUS

The Chorus crashes into the bed sheet and gets tangled up
still kicking its legs wildly

VAUGHN
»Still pulling left

CUT TO George stands on a BAIL OF HAY and leads a LARGE DOG
to trot around him on a leash luring it ahead with a bit of
hotdog on the end of a stick

On one side of the dog two Flower Limbs have been fastened
with rope to his front and back leg so that they mimic the leg
motion as he walks

Vaughn speaks to George

VAUGHN
I dont care Take him down to the fence
and back a few times I guess just no more
walking in circles

The Chorus comes racing into frame and crashes into the
ground spraying snow into the air Vaughn and George look
over

Hector who has been chasing it puts his hands on his knees
and gasps for breath as the Chorus continues kicking its legs
in the air

HECTOR
Hes stillpulling left

He takes the Necklace of Controllers off his neck and tosses
it into the snow

HECTOR (CONTD)
And thatis crap is what

INT CONCRETE FRAME - CONTINUOUS

Carter sits at a table watching Vaughn and them through the
window

He turns to see Graham come through the door and approach
Euclid who is standing at a workbench on the other side of the
room

Beside the workbench is another Chorus Carter turns his
attention to it contemplating

CLOSE ON CHORUS Like Vaughns Chorus this one has 4 Flower
Limbs but has a simple WOODEN PLANK instead of a box for a
torso and the Limbs are completely straight making it look
more like a table A Funnel Stack is secured to the bottom of
the wooden plank The Stack launches up a few inches lifting

the Chorus and stretching the Flower Limbs Then it slowly
descends

CLOSE ON FUNNEL STACK We see now that as the Stack descends
it comes closer to a Controller placed far below it The
close proximity eventually causes the Stack to lightly launch
again lifting the Chorus with it

CLOSE ON LIMB It compresses smoothly like its hydraulic
Carter seems mesmerized by it His attention is jarred by

EUCLID
Then go play with them Graham You can
help them pick it up every ten feet Have
fun cleaning the mud off it

GRAHAM
We dont even have knees yet

EUCLID
Its learning And theyre not making
anything its a dog

GRAHAM
Better than this thing

Euclid looks to Carter for help Carter eventually
understands what Euclid expects from him and responds half-
heartedly

CARTER
oh Graham shut up Its balancing
Its important

Graham looks harshly at Euclid before producing SOMETHING from
his jacket and setting it on the workbench It is an
assemblage of Petals like two Flowers joined together but
altered so that they can bend relative to each other like a
knee joint This is a KNEE PIECE

Euclid turns to it

EUCLID
Put it back

Graham stares him down Euclid turns back to Graham

EUCLID
Put it back

CUT TO Euclid is copying the Knee Piece connecting the

final Petals of an identical one He uses Petals fresh out of
a decayed Funnel Graham looks on

Euclid finishes Without looking he places the original Knee
Piece in front of Graham and sweeps the mess of leftover
Detritus with his hand into an ORANGE BUCKET stashing a CHUNK
of it in his own COAT POCKET

EUCLID
Put it back

Graham leaves with the original as Carter plays with the
copied Knee trying out the bending motion

INT ALBERTS BARN - NEXT

In one of the stalls Albert Marcus and Javier crouch
beneath a HORSE Albert manipulates the horse ankle with his
hands demonstrating to the other two

ALBERT
»see it doesnt just slam to the ground
the way we- its like a wrist sort of

see

MARCUS
Why is it like a wrist though if its on
his leg

Albert brings the hoof down on the ground and then back up
simulating the horse taking a step

ALBERT
I dont know it kinda

JAVIER
kinda helps him land

ALBERT
yeah and gets him ready to take the
next step maybe
They dont notice Graham silently walk across behind them
He sneakily returns the Knee Piece to a box of Flowers
On his way out he passes a Flower Limb hanging from a tall
shelf It is recreating the leg motion of a horse trotting

EXT FIELD - DUSK

CASH travels from one MITTENED HAND to another

WIDE Euclid standing next to Vaughn stashes the cash in a
jacket pocket as Albert approaches

Euclid receives the Maker from Vaughn and hands it to Albert

VAUGHN
Its empty

The three split leaving three distinct sets of footprints in
the snow

CUT TO Euclid having walked 50 yards slows to a stop He
turns back

CUT TO Back at where the three footprints split he turns to
follow Alberts
EXT WOODWORKING SHOP - NEXT

He creeps toward the building The sound of a POWER SAW
inside the shop is winding down

He freezes when he sees Albert Marcus and Javier all in
backpacks leaving off to his left They dont see him

NT WOODWORKING SHOP - NEXT

Euclid finds BUCKETS of SAWDUST on a table near different
kinds of power saws He sifts through one of the buckets with
his hand

CUT TO He finds the Maker under a sheet He listens to it
purr

He checks the grating with his finger and wipes away sawdust

He has to smileand then after a thought the smile
disappears
EXT FIELD - DUSK

Albert carrying the Maker approaches Euclid and Carter He
hands it to Carter

ALBERT
Its full

Euclid opens his mouth but the words dont come for a second
He settles on a sincere

EUCLID
Thank you

ALBERT
Should last until next timeif Vaughn
doesnt run it too hard

EUCLID
Ill talk to him

Euclid and Carter go one way Albert goes the other

EXT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

Euclids Chorus now with knee joints and a PLYWOOD TORSO
stands in the snow The Limbs slowly compress and expand
slightly making hundreds of small adjustments to stay up

Euclid and Carter shovel snow away from its feet

CUT TO The other kids are here now They surround the
Chorus running their hands along its wooden plank studying
it They press down on it gently to see if it pushes back
Some hover their hands above it to see the subtle movement as
it rises and falls

Euclid looks on

One by one they back away from it as Euclid waves them to each
side When they are clear he SHOVES the Chorus hard with the
bottom of his foot with enough force to push it over

Except it doesnt fall over It braces itself with its Limbs
and recovers its balance like a fawn

The kids stare in awe

EXT FIELD - NEXT

Albert angrily trudges through the snow flanked by Marcus and
Javier

He abruptly stops smacks his fist and turns back for a
second before continuing frustrated

ALBERT
We dont have anything

INT ALBERTS BARN - NEXT

Were on the floor focused on some nearby floorboards Far
out of focus we see Albert and them come through the entrance
He knocks the box of Flowers off the workbench and they
scatter everywhere

We hear him do more damage and the Flower Limb comes skidding
across the floor into focus It weakly flexes bending back
and forth

EXT FIELD - DAY

Euclid (wearing a Necklace of Controllers) Graham and Samuel
pull on ropes attached to the front of the Chorus while Carter
pushes it from behind They are trying with all their
strength to get the Chorus to move forward It finally does
but just a step before it braces again allowing no forward
momentum

They take a quick break winded Euclid looks around to see
if they are being watched before

EUCLID
Okay come on

CARTER
What

EUCLID
Lets go

Carter is frustrated and reluctant but stays quiet

EUCLID (CONTD)
What

They continue pullingpushing

INT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

Albert stands holding out a GREEN MARKER in his left hand and
a RED MARKER in his right He is focused on a spot on the
floor waiting for this conversation to end

CARTER (OFF SCREEN)
What dont you like about it

WIDE Everybodys there Carter and Euclid stand near Albert
at the front

CARTER
We have one that wont budge without four
of us dragging it and the other one runs
into the ground every-

From the back where Vaughn Hector and George sit

VAUGHN
Hes getting better He just needs-

Carter stays on Euclid not even looking to Vaughn

CARTER
No he isnt What dont you like about
it

EUCLID

Its a trick Theres a right way to go-
to do things and theres a- this is a
trick

CARTER
But if it works then its the right way
to go I mean right

Vaughn entertains Hector and George his eyes going wide in

disbelief and boredom with the conversation He holds out his

hand waiting for Euclids answer and then mouths it himself
right He rolls his eyes when instead

EUCLID (OFF SCREEN)
I dont know

Albert continues to wait

EUCLID (OFF SCREEN)
So you think its smart

CARTER (OFF SCREEN)
I think its the best idea hes ever had

Albert tries to hide his beaming

INT VAUGHNS HOUSE BASEMENT - DAY

THE GREEN MARKER is brought down the length of a Flower Limb

ALBERT (OFF SCREEN)
Try your best

CUT TO HANDS string a length of thin leather with RED AND
GREEN MARKED CONTROLLERS to make new Necklace

CUT TO We PAN DOWN the length of a COMPLETED FLOWER LIMB
The Flowers marks alternate RED GREEN RED GREEN etc

EXT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

WIDE Albert wearing the Necklace walks to a point 100 fee
away from the kids who are gathered just outside the building
He is on the extreme right and they are on the left

He turns and faces them

t

He concentrates
He grips the Necklace in one hand

The new hybrid Chorus steps forward from where it was hidden
among the building and kids

It moves like a newborn foal stumbling a few times

As it makes progress towards Albert it becomes more
surefooted By the time it gets to him it is moving at a
regular trot

Albert puts up his hand to stop it The Chorus comes to a
halt under his hand like a lifelong pet

EXT CONSTRUCTION YARD - LATER

The kids are leaning WOODEN PALETTES up against random PILES
of BRICKS and LUMBER to create a fenced-in area about 50 feet
in diameter Carter directs them to fill in empty spaces with
CRATES and ROCKS

Vaughn wearing the Controller Necklace leads the Chorus like
a horse around the interior of the barrier He gets it to
gallop and LEAP in the air a couple times

Albert and others watch with excitement

ALBERT
Higher Higher

DUSK

Hector and Marcus hang on the outside of one of the palettes
staring into the makeshift corral at the Chorus Alone now
it continues to circle the barrier before slowing to a walk
almost looking like its found something interesting in the

dirt

Euclid and Carter close a palette that functions as the gate
to the corral and tie it shut with some extension cords
Then keying off Hector and Marcus they also watch the
Chorus

It nudges something on the ground but then seems to lose
interest and trots off in a random direction adding a small
leap after a moment It acts just like any animal that finds
itself in new surroundings

The kids stare captivated not knowing what to make of it

NIGHT

The Chorus is left alone in its pen It paces around the
circumference

DAWN

As Euclid approaches the corral he cranes his neck to try to
find the Chorus but doesnt see it

The gate is open He enters revealing

Albert Vaughn and Marcus crouch on the ground with boxes of
Flowers around them Loose pieces litter the area They work
on short Flower Limbs securing them to a MAHOGANY CHEST

EUCLID
Whyd you take him apart

Albert answers without looking up from his work

ALBERT
We didnt These are the leftovers

Euclid tries to digest this and takes a scan around the corral
looking for the Chorus Its not there

EUCLID
Then where is he

The three wont look at Euclid Marcus glances around
nervously

EUCLID
Allie where is he

EXT TREELINE - NEXT
The ten kids spread out into the woods searching intently
George breaks the silence calling out into the trees

GEORGE
HeyHey

After a moment he mumbles to Hector

We should have named it

EXT WOODS - NEXT

Taking a break Javier pulls out a THERMOS from the backpack
Marcus is wearing Marcus waits patiently

JAVIER
-but you cant teach it- you want this

We hear the squealing of a vehicles brakes far off

MARCUS
Is that the bus

JAVIER
when it goes over the fence
Nogarbage truck

MARCUS
What time is it

JAVIER
We got time

CUT TO Euclid searches through the trees bringing up the
rear

He finds something in his coat pocket the Detritus chunk he
had stashed earlier He studies it for a second rubbing off
some flakes before absentmindedly smelling it

The grains of Detritus on his fingers look like brown sugar
Something about it intrigues him He tastes it

After a few more steps he suddenly STOPS He turns back and
to the left on a hunch motionless Carter notices

CARTER
You see him

EUCLID
Back maybe

CARTER
Where

EUCLID

Lets go back
218 EXT LONE TREE - NEXT

AN IMPRINT OF THE CHORUS FOOT is a few inches deep in the
dark earth under the snow

We hear a POUNDING every two seconds like clockwork

ANOTHER IMPRINT Within it a FAINT WHITE SHAPE is coming up
from just under the soil like a budding sprout Another
POUNDING

A CHORUS LIMB goes compact before PUNCHING into the ground
like a hydraulic It leaves a new IMPRINT and then moves over
a bit to make another one

SEVERAL IMPRINTS have been made in a TREES BARK Growing out
of the imprints are what look like WHITE CORAL SHOOTS a few
inches long The Chorus is farming

WIDE The kids stare on silently as the Chorus works under a
SINGLE LARGE TREE in the middle of a huge field

Javier takes a rock and begins scraping on a nearby coral
growth After a second of testing it he gives up and tosses
the rock into the coral patch

JAVIER
Its hard

he Chorus halts what its doing and comes over to sweep the
ock out of its patch kicking it clear The kids ponder
his

All of them take off towards the bus except George who
continues to watch the Chorus work

HECTOR (CONTD)
George bus

GEORGE
Im not going

CUT TO A few meters from the tree George has gathered the
remaining boxes of Flowers (marked red and green) and has
pieces spread out around him He is continuing to assemble
the second Chorus using the mahogany chest from earlier Its
about half complete now

The original Chorus (PLYWOOD) continues to work and some of
the coral shoots are up to a foot long making the area under
the tree look like a small garden

CUT TO George runs with the newly completed (MAHOGANY)
Chorus playing chase while the original continues its work

George drops to a knee to tie his shoe When he looks up the
Mahogany Chorus is moving towards the tree He places a hand
on his Necklace and calls out

GEORGE
Wait come on back Come on

The Chorus returns to him

CUT TO GEORGE has made a small SNOW FORT using the Flower
Boxes to make bricks of snow He is using the Mahogany Chorus
to haul two boxes full of snow on its back to the fort

George unloads one box of snow but when he goes for the
second

DOLLY AWAY from George as he realizes the Chorus is moving
away again He grabs the Necklace

GEORGE
Hold up Come on back Back

DOLLY FORWARD as the Mahogany Chorus enters frame returning
to him

CUT TO They play some more sort of wrestling George
pushes the Chorus off balance It recovers and just like a
dog puts its front legs on George gently knocking him to the
ground

DOLLY AWAY from George as he gets up off the ground He
places his hand on the Necklace and calls toward us as we move
further away from him

GEORGE
Come on Come back Back Stop boy

CAMERA STOP The Chorus steps into frame ready to return to
George

But he gives up deciding to let the Chorus go He removes
the Necklace and shoves it into his jacket

WIDE The Mahogany Chorus joins the Plywood Chorus in its

work at the tree George goes back to working on the snow
fort alone

EXT RURAL ROAD - LATER

Determined the kids walk towards us from the bus that has
just dropped them off

seeing

Dont know
VAUGHN

Did you try to
George holds out the two Necklaces to the others

GEORGE
Go ahead

OPPOSITE ANGLE The garden of Coral Shoots has grown larger
Some shoots are several feet long and whether they come from
the ground or the tree bark they all converge at a spot a few
feet in the air and just off the tree

UT TO A METAL LATCH is screwed into the other Chorus
orso

UT TO Albert and Carter use the Necklaces to back the
horuses away some

hen TWO LEASHES are attached to the latches on the Choruses
lbert and Carter let go of the Necklaces relieved The
horuses are now tethered to a nearby TREE STUMP

Q are aa aa

UT TO At the Convergence the kids clear away HANDFULS of
Detritus revealing the outer edges of a SOLID WHITE OBJECT

bout the size of a muffler It is wedged inside the
RANSLUCENT MATRIX of converging Coral Shoots

Ho

he kids begin to slide the object out The object is a
ROND It resembles the HEXAGONAL CONE SHAPE hollowed out in
he amber plates from the adult story

UT TO Carter carries the Frond to the kids wagon and
laces it carefully inside Others are already trying to
onnect Controllers and Petals to it experimenting

QaTQ AwWH

UT TO Carter leaves the others to it taking a seat 20 feet
way thinking

9 Q

Everyone is removing the leftover Detritus on the Frond
turning it over trying to find its purpose Carter notices
that the Choruses are facing the Frond waiting patiently He
gets an idea

CARTER
Graham bring the wagon over here

Graham is trying to jam a Flower into a FLOWER-SHAPED PORT
built into the Frond He doesnt want to quit his probing so
he orders Samuel

GRAHAM
Pull it over to him and Ill keep it
stead-

CARTER
Go

Graham panics and starts pulling the wagon towards Carter
running Samuel helps

Carter and the others look on as
The Choruses TURN TOWARDS THE WAGON as it moves
By the time the wagon gets to Carter hes sure

CARTER
Lets give it back

CUT TO Carter carefully places the Frond in the snow

THE LEASHES are removed from the Choruses

They immediately charge over and each locks one of their
shoulders into two Flower-Shaped PORTS on the Frond In this

way they are able to carry the Frond between them as they
move

They head off with it

CUT TO As the group follows the Choruses Euclid notices
that the Frond DRAGS a bit in the snow

EUCLID
They should have been taller

George and Hector walk together

GEORGE
You know where were going dont you

Hector looks forward without an answer George teases

GEORGE (CONTD)
Do you know

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

The Choruses deposit the Frond on the floor near the Maker
which is roughly the same size and shape

One Chorus nudges it toward the Maker while the other pushes
the Maker toward the Frond until the two touch but nothing
happens The Choruses keep trying

CARTER
All right get em back

CUT TO From a distance the kids compare the Frond with the
Maker contemplating looking from one to the other

THE FROND is white and beautiful in its symmetry They turn
to

THE MAKER is black filthy worn out and on closer scrutiny
we see

EUCLID
Bolts

CUT TO Vaughn has his arm inside the Makers ejector tray
probing He pulls his arm out with no success Euclid and
Albert study the Maker as close as they can

GEORGE
How inside Wheres the hole Why
doesnt it open then

EUCLID

Bad design

CUT TO Carter strains to pry the Maker open with a CROWBAR
Others brace Carter to give him leverage Euclid and the rest
try to hold the Maker still on the table

After a second Carter stops breathless

CARTER
Waitwait

He sort of laughs realizing something Euclid
misunderstands

EUCLID
Were holding it Were trying

CARTER
No I know

He laughs some more and shakes his head amazed that theyve
been this stupid

EUCLID
Whats going on

CARTER
Here get this out

hey pull the crowbar out and put it aside

UT TO Fingers trace a GROOVE in the side of the Maker A
lat NEW DISC is slid into the groove A HAMMER taps the Disc
ntil it is halfway in

cma

UT TO The Maker has a GAPING HOLE in one side where the

isc has grown into a Funnel We can hear METAL BENDING and
REAKING as the Funnel continues to grow until the outer shell
f the Maker POPS open like the cover of a book causing
veryone to start

2oaua

UT TO From above we see the Frond sitting next to the
aker With the lid open we can now see what lies inside the
aker something identical in shape and color to the Frond
he only difference is that the Frond has EIGHT SLITS in its
op and the enclosed one has a LARGE CIRCLE SLOT instead (the
ame size as the original discs) So now we have a CIRCLE
ROND and an EIGHT-SLIT FROND

PTHOctHE SOA

under his coat

Albert steps inside sees Euclid on the floor and then
notices something across the room

The Eight-Slit Frond has grown SOMETHING in its slits

With both hands he carefully pulls it out an EIGHT POINT
STARBURST It is flat like the original discs

He walks over and sits next to Euclid captivated by the find

ALBERT
Uke look at this

Euclid doesnt even stir Albert then sees ANOTHER STARBURST
in Euclids hand This one however has grown to an INCH
THICK

Albert settles against the wall resting next to Euclid He
makes a pillow with his backpack

CUT TO The two are now asleep against the wall
arter walks in and sees them Curious he crouches and

tudies the Starbursts in their hands both now an inch thick
his prompts him to check the Frond

Hada

UT TO Carter finds ANOTHER STARBURST waiting in the Frond
e attempts to pry it out

zaQ

CUT TO At a table Albert drops his Starburst into a Flower
where it fits perfectly and slides down

Euclid drops his in next right on top of the first one

When Carter adds his the three Starbursts act as one and
LOUDLY SNAP APART where the eight points meet This leaves
EIGHT SEPARATE FINGERS that slowly wake up

The kids first concern is that
again

they have lost their hearing

VAUGHN
Its almost ready

George acknowledges in a state of high concentration Vaughn
and Hector look at each other worried

VAUGHN
(to George)
Are you sure

George answers by not answering He moves to retrieve the
Starburst Vaughn and Hector quickly run out

George ties a quick knot through the Starburst with some
FISHING LINE and moves to the band saw where he sets up the
Starburst on the platform and prepares to slice off one of its
Fingers

EXT WOODWORKING SHOP - NEXT

50 feet away Vaughn and Hector drop to the ground trying to
shield themselves behind a small hill Vaughn raises a pair
of BINOCULARS toward the shop

Suddenly a CLAP OF THUNDER comes from the shop The kids
flinch and cower They recover just in time for another CLAP
and a moment later a third

We hear the band saw wind down and George comes running to
them from the shop uncoiling FISHING LINE along the way

Once there he has to deal with a knot on the SPOOL Vaughn
and Hector approach him cautiously worried about him

HECTOR
You all right

No response George continues untangling the knot facing the
other direction Vaughn tests Georges hearing

VAUGHN
Hey Lets get away from here

George turns around frustrated with the knot He clearly
hasnt heard anything

GEORGE
Lets get out of here I11 do this
later

EXT SMALL CLIFF - LATER

The three kids lie at the edge of the cliff using a BAND OF
SEVERAL FISHING POLES to lower something to the bottom They
are trying to be as precise as they can

A FLOWER lies at the cliff bottom next to a COFFEE CAN OF
BOILING WATER

The Flower already has TWO FIVE-FINGERED STARBURSTS in it
ANOTHER is being lowered on the fishing line It slowly
slides in on top of the first two snaps and blooms It
looks more like a human hand now There are still nubs where
the three fingers were cut but they dont get in the way as
they move

The water in the coffee can suddenly stops boiling
GEORGE
Told you

EXT HUGE CONCRETE HOLE - LATER

Using the same trick with the flag (where the kids dumped the
Disc fragments last summer) the three LEFTOVER FINGERS are
dropped into the deep hole

EXT CONCRETE FRAME - DAY

Vaughn ties a rope knot with his left hand and using the
Chorus’ Hand as his right The process is completely organic
with the Chorus’ Hand showing all the dexterity of Vaughn’s
Across from him Javier guides him through the steps by tying
his own knot

Vaughn’s face shows how serene and even joyful it is to
control the Hand now When hes done he holds the knot up

VAUGHN

INT SCHOOL BUS - DAY
AN ILLUSTRATED SIGN LANGUAGE BOOK A page is turned
George wearing EARMUFFS sits in his seat on the bus studying
the book and practicing with his hands Hector sits next to

him picking up what he can

We follow Javier down the aisle where he stops at Georges
seat and waits for his attention

When George looks up Javier signs thank you George nods
accepting the gratitude

Javier continues down the aisle only to be replaced by Samuel
who also waits and then signs thank you

Next is Albert

INT WOODWORKING SHOP - DAY

George is preparing to retrieve another Starburst from the
Fronds finding the edges of it with his fingers

Hector slides a piece of paper on the table into Georges
view

On the paper is handwritten 10 Buzz kite Striped
gloves with a few lines scratched out above it 5
Aquafrankie II (with bowl and flakes and clean rocks) 10
and S10 Striped gloves

George checks it shakes his head No and starts signing
fast with one hand Hector tries to keep up

HECTOR
C-L-M is that M Wait go slow

Hector signs to slow down George signs slower

HECTOR

Hector relays to Marcus and Albert who are waiting nearby

HECTOR

Hector shows him the sign language for open Marcus moves
in front of George and mouths and signs I have not opened
it

George seems upset at the distraction and pulls the Starburst
from the Fronds deep in his work

HECTOR
Lets get going

They all run out leaving George to fire up the saw

EXT WOODWORKING SHOP - NEXT

Hector Marcus and Albert watch the shop from 20 yards off
They brace for the sound but still flinch when it comes

BANG BANG

EXT WOODS - DAY

Euclid and Carter yank hard on a LONG ROPE

The other end of the rope is tied to a JACK supporting a
RUSTED OUT STATION WAGON with no wheels The jack topples and
the car drops a few feet coming down on a LAWNMOWER BLADE
which in turn slices through a couple WOOD PLANKS beneath it

GEORGE watches this presentation thinking We now see that
the kids are 30 yards from the car

EUCLID
What do you think Pretty good huh

Hector relays this message to George

CARTER
Its safer

George signs something and walks away carrying another Five-
Fingered Starburst

HECTOR
He says its okay the way it is

They follow after George in frustration

EUCLID
What How is it okay

CARTER
(to Euclid)
Hes helping He likes to feel like hes
helping

EUCLID
(to Carter)
How is it okay He shouldnt be doing it-
(calling after George)
You shouldnt be cutting them up anyways

INT BARN - LATER

Vaughn marks TWO FLOWERS part of the Mahogany Chorus with a
BLACK MARKER

VAUGHN
take out two from each front leg put
them on the backitll make him lean
forward get a little faster

Vaughn circles around the Chorus with the marker looking for
design changes Graham tries to help and notices something

He picks at the Eight-Fingered Hand and a little Detritus
comes off He looks to the Chorus altered Five-Fingered Hand
for comparison

CUT TO George and Hector walk in followed by Euclid and
Carter George tries to give his just-created Five-Fingered
Hand to Vaughn but

VAUGHN
We dont need it maybe

Vaughn and Graham are tearing away THREE DECAYED FINGERS on
the Eight-Fingered Hand The positions of the decaying
fingers are the same as the missing ones sliced off the Five-
Fingered Hand The Chorus is conforming to the kids design

Vaughn looks to Euclid

VAUGHN
It was the right thing to do Were
supposed to
Euclid cant be convinced shaking his head

EUCLID
You dontwe dont know

Just then the Chorus reaches over with its Five-Fingered Hand
and pulls off one of the decayed Fingers completely

Euclid looks to Carter and then down having to concede
With the decayed Fingers gone the now Five-Fingered Hand
stretches going through a full degree of motion trying to
reach the ground

MATCH CUT TO
EXT MAKESHIFT CORRAL - NIGHT
The Hand finds the soft dirt gripping it like a paw

The Chorus takes a few careful steps with its new handsfeet

TWO LONG LEASHES are unraveling as the Choruses move further
from the post they are tied to

They stop at the end of their leashes

A CHORUS HAND reaches up and grabs hold of the leash latched
to its torso It YANKS

MORNING

The kids stand there staring at the empty corral After a
second

GEORGE (OFF SCREEN)
They stole them

The kids turn towards the concrete frame

INT CONCRETE FRAME - NEXT

They all crowd the entrance staring at the empty space where
the Fronds should be

VAUGHN
Lets go get them

EXT CONCRETE FRAME- NEXT

Eight of them depart one way Euclid and Carter loiter at the
side waiting for the others to clear out They leave in the
opposite direction up to something

INT EUCLIDS ROOM - NEXT

On a desk DUSTY DETRITUS PARTICLES are swept by hand into a
neat pile a few millimeters tall A ONE-INCH CHUNK of
Detritus sits nearby

Carter and Euclid look at the pile thinking

CARTER
Water

Euclid slowly nods Carter leaves

Euclid picks up the chunk holds it in front of his face and
takes a small bite

CUT TO Carter returns with a PAPER CUP of water but doesnt
find Euclid standing where he left him He swings to the left
and looks down to where Euclid sits on the floor against the
bedpost staring forward

CUT TO Were behind Euclid Carter takes a seat in front of
him curiously scanning his face Euclid is feeling around
for nearby objects rolling them around in his hands and then
tossing them aside a t-shirt a book a shoe

Carter more amused than worried decides to help He puts
down the water and begins to pick up objects tossing them
aside Meanwhile Euclid reaches for the paper cup

He turns it around in his hands and after it passes some test
he tosses out the water and just holds it in his left hand

He stretches the fingers on his right hand and then makes a
tight fist Again and again he does this

Carter not knowing what to do decides to stretch out his
hand as well mirroring Euclid

Euclid then places his fingers in front of his own face

Carter follows and again mimicking Euclid places the pad of
each fingertip gently between his front teeth lightly
pinching a quarter-inch of skin testing it before moving to
the next After four fingers have been tested they move back
to their index fingers

Euclid jerks his hand away from his face violently Carter
goes from amused to horrified

Euclid brings another finger to his mouth and again bites off
a bit of flesh from the pad Carter lunges forward to stop
him grabbing his arm

CARTER
No Stop it Stop it

But Euclid isnt trying to bite any more Instead he brings
his BLOODY FINGERS to the paper cup and begins rolling it
around slowly and methodically leaving blood at every touch

Carter can only watch As the cup turns around he peers
closer seeing something that amazes him

CUT TO EUCLIDS EYES open He wakes and walks to the desk
where Carter sits studying 10 PAPER CUPS each marked up with
blood

Carter hands Euclid a cup and points out what is sketched in
blood on it

CARTER
The hill where Vaughn built that ramp the
big oak tree see

Carter turns the cup over in Euclids hand to show him the
other side

CARTER
and the water tower

Euclid checks the band-aids on his fingertips flicking flakes
of dried blood into the air

CARTER
Where would you have to be
EXT HILLTOP - LATER
Euclid and Carter lead the other eight kids up the hill
towards the two Choruses which are clearing ROCKS and

BRANCHES from the area The two Fronds sit nearby

The eight kids concentrate on getting control of Choruses
packing up the Fronds

Euclid looks around at the horizon He holds out one of the
paper cups He rotates his body around 360 degrees while
turning the cup in his hand at the same rate comparing the
blood print to the real world they are the same

At the end of the turn he notices Carter 50 feet off He’s
found something behind a large boulder

CUT TO They both look at a CORAL SHOOT hidden from the
others Inside it we can make out the shape of a THIRD FROND

EUCLID
Anyone see it

Carter shakes his head

They glance back at the other kids worried about how to
proceed Euclid leaves the decision with Carter

EUCLID
You found it

We hear the first few measures of the Christmas carol What
Sweeter Music

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

AN ISOLATED SECTION OF A PEW is being draped with peoples
coats as they sit down Rabbit fur and silk linings cover the
seat

Euclid lays his coat on top of these open so that he can
recline into it when he sits He slowly collapses resting
We hear the choir SING The moment is gold and warm and holds
the promise of protection He sinks deeper taking in the
music

INT CONCRETE FRAME - INTERCUT

Marcus has his ear to the original Frond Its silent

MARCUS
Needs more sawdust

He and Javier are there alone Javier quits his work on their
Chorus (now in a WOODEN CAGE) and retrieves a Tupperware
container from his backpack taking caution

JAVIER
Watch the door

He uses a SCOOPER to scrape the insides of the container but
comes up with less than a tablespoon of sawdust

JAVIER (CONTD)
We gotta go make some

CUT TO They bundle up in parkas and scarves ready to head

out
MARCUS
Sick of sawdust I dont even know why
they need it You know

JAVIER
Yeah

MARCUS
Theyre not made of woodwhy do we have
toits stupid

Marcus swings the door open to the BLUSTERY WIND outside
Javier immediately shuts it He has an idea

CUT TO Javier fills his scooper with Detritus from the
Orange Bucket He looks to Marcus for any last words

He sifts the Detritus over the Frond Leaves

CUT TO They have their ears to the Frond It purrs at
higher frequency

JAVIER
Sounds different Yeah

MARCUS
Better

Euclid walks past tables of HOMEMADE DESSERTS searching
something someone Adults crowd the place

Then he sees what he’s looking for across the room

with other kids’ grubby hands before getting one

He turns to a nearby stack of PAPER PLATES and has to contend

CUT TO Olivia slices and serves BLACK FOREST CAKE It’s
hectic but she’s managing with a smile She fidgets with her
necklace a thin leather strip with something hanging from it
hidden beneath her top Euclid cranes his neck to see as she
brings it out a DECORATIVE STAR MADE OF POPSICLE STICKS

He receives his cake from her and loiters awkwardly We can

OLIVIA
Good

Euclid looks up She’s talking to him

OLIVIA (CONTD)
It’s good

His mouth is full He just about gets it down when out of
nowhere Carter nudges him

CARTER
Crispy Treats

Euclid turns his head this way and that trying to help find
the treats through the crowd

EUCLID
I saw them

Meanwhile he puts his cake down and grabs an empty plate

Olivia doesnt get it She tries and fails to get Euclids
attention but he fakes like there is too much noise

OLIVIA

He finally turns to her but pretends he cant hear her

EUCLID

Olivia gives up

INT CONCRETE FRAME - INTERCUT

A DISC grows slowly out of the Frond and

falls to the ground and settles

Javier and Marcus look up from their work assembling Flowers

MARCUS
That was too fast

CUT TO Marcus collects the new Disc from the ground
Theyre pleased

JAVIER
Well get twice as many

CUT TO They sift the entire bucket of Detritus over the
Leaves of the Frond The sound of it accumulating and
crackling becomes

INT CHURCH - INTERCUT

the sound of APPLAUSE as people rush into the sanctuary to
find their seats

Euclid makes his way down the aisle through the crowd

We hear the faint sound of Olivia calling his name Still
moving forward he looks back over his shoulder to the left

Then to the right craning his neck to see past the adults
Then to the left

A GREEN RIBBON TIED AROUND A SMALL ROCK hangs from a branch

Euclid races towards it

The Chorus trails him but is gaining quickly

Euclid snatches the ribbon Immediately the Chorus turns 90
degrees carving a corner in the ground with its powerful
Limbs

Euclid turns to see it heading off

EUCLID
Shit

CUT TO A YELLOW RIBBON hangs from another tree

It’s about to be snatched by the approaching Chorus

EXT RAVINE - NEXT

The Chorus races toward the ravine The yellow ribbon whips
in the wind hanging out of the front storage section of its
torso

Euclid descends a ladder into the shallow ravine He checks
over his shoulder at the BLUE RIBBON stuck under some rocks at
the bottom of the ravine

Above him the Chorus leaps into the ravine never even
slowing

uclid sees this stops his descent and climbs up

E
CUT TO At the top he kicks the ladder into the ravine and
continues the race

When he runs 50 feet the Chorus leaps up and out of the
ravine behind him in a single jump

UT TO Euclid approaches a tree sidestepping a LARGE TARP
hat seemingly covers the ground in front of it The
stretched tarp has leaves and earth and branches covering it
as camouflage

taQ

He waits before grabbing the PURPLE RIBBON out of a nook
The Chorus comes to halt at the tarp

Euclid threatens to grab the ribbon provoking the Chorus to
lurch forward slightly

But it’s not enough The Chorus thinks better of it and takes
its time finding the edges of the tarp trap and going around
slowly INSERT we see the DEEP PIT beneath the translucent
tarp

As it gets closer Euclid resigns

EUCLID
Goddamn it

Euclid takes purple yanking the ribbon

The Chorus breaks off for the next one

He exits the storm drain and sees the Chorus coming down the
hill from another other direction Euclid hauls for ribbon
and

actually gets it He ducks down anticipating the Chorus
charge But it doesnt come

Excited he circles the boulder looking for the Chorus but
finds himself alone
EXT WOODS - NEXT

The Chorus is ROOTING out something from under a tangle of mud
and heavy branches

Euclid and Carter approach

CARTER
Was it close

EUCLID
No I had him Three out of five

He opens his hand showing his three ribbons

He looks around nervously

JAVIER

You good Sure Oh a little more Ok

The Chorus finally finishes and

moves to leave

JAVIER
(commanding)
No Come back

The Chorus ignores him He follows after it growing
desperate wringing the Controller Necklace

JAVIER
(pleading)
Come on God please Please

It turns back for a second like an invisible tether has
pulled it Then it breaks off at full gallop into the woods

CUT TO Euclid Carter and Graham are having trouble getting
the Mahogany Chorus settled in its cage It bucks and stirs
occasionally lurching forward a step before submitting to its
masters

Javier standing off to the side with Marcus sees what the
Chorus wants across the room a discarded Funnel

and Javier to different sides of the room

Javier lies on the floor stunned and bloodied around the
mouth He slowly recovers stands up and takes in the chaos
in the room He sees on his left

The Chorus continues to pick up every Funnel it can find in
the room and stack it on the Frond

On Javier’s right Marcus does the same frantically helping
the Chorus gather Funnels

faster A Funnel is added then another then another then

Marcus searches the room finding something that worries him
His eyes follow it towards the door

MARCUS

Javier is reaching his forearm through both the door handle
and a handle attached to the doorframe trying to grab the
other side of the chain to pull it through He looks up
startled

The Chorus CHARGES the door CRACKING it open a couple inches
pinning Javier’s arm He gasps with shock He tries to push
back to get his arm free with no luck

The gap between the door and the doorframe grows slowly

JAVIER
No

Marcus gets in front of the door and pushes with all his
might

The strain on Javier’s forearm grows as the door opens wider

Ambulance which is now parked in front of one of the houses
across the street

Carter catches him with his arm stopping him before he can
cross the street He speaks directly into Euclids ear

CARTER
It could be anything You dont know

Euclid looks to Carter and then to the other kids that he now
sees are waiting nearby Some are in pajamas They all look
worried

A STRETCHER is desperately rolled towards the ambulance from

the house carrying a little girl We see her BARE FEET then
her PINK NIGHTGOWN then BLOOD soaking the sheet that covers

He scrounges around and finds

EXT TOOL SHED - NEXT

A SMALL METAL BOX is laid on a bench Euclid opens it
revealing an assortment of NUMBER STENCILS in different
styles

WIDE He sits alone looking through the box

CLOSE Using a pencil he traces around the stencils ona
piece of wood putting together address numbers like “439” and
“2926”

CARTER

Whatever it was he used to feed it he’s
telling everyone

CUT TO Now Carter sits next to him Out of earshot and
across from them the other kids are killing time unloading
the trailer just back from a day of snow shoveling

CARTER

-he’s got enough to get going again
Enough to last a while he says And
Vaughn just eggs him

Euclid walks off with his box of numbers ending their

Euclid absentmindedly carves into a tree with a pocketknife
while Carter talks to him

He looks to Carter and reiterates

EUCLID
For what

CARTER
For you to stop them

Euclid turns back to his work with the knife He takes on a

sarcastic tone

Carter questions Graham and Samuel In the background Euclid
approaches ready for school but hes still out of earshot

SAMUEL
They took it somewhere I guess Packed it
up But they have it

CARTER
I know they have it Sam but are they
using it

Carter looks to Graham to get his take Graham and Samuel
stare back at him for a second Graham has his own suspicion
of Carter now

GRAHAM
How do you know they have it

Carter contemplates getting into that conversation Something
occurs to Samuel

SAMUEL
Of course they’re using it Why would
theyve gone all the way down there and
got it It’s a hundred miles It’d take
forever

Euclid arrives Carter takes a step back trying to dissolve
the conversation before he overhears

CARTER
Okay shhhh

Carter joins Euclid and they head off for the bus leaving
Graham and Samuel behind

Graham speaks too loud to Samuel

GRAHAM
But it doesnt matter right Not like
were gonna do anything-

Carter flashes a look back at him Graham notices out of his
peripheral vision and goes silent fast

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE GARAGE - NIGHT

GRAHAM
Probably four stacks

Graham and Samuel are recounting everything to Euclid who is
consumed with working on an address plaque the end result of
what he began with the number stencils He places the last of
a few layers of wood on top and wipes away the glue that gets
squeezed out

SAMUEL
Probably 20 or 30 funnels high probably
this high each of ‘em

Behind them Carter watches Euclid for any signs of interest
There are none

What How do you know that

SAMUEL
We all know they’re doing-

GRAHAM
No how tall they are

Carter puts his hand on Samuels shoulder quieting him
Euclid shakes a spray can of varnish never looking up from
his work

EXT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

EUCLID is nailing up an address plaque on the front of the
house

Taking a break from shoveling snow off the driveway Carter is

helping him align it

CARTER
Upupleft side up justthats good

Graham and Samuel run up to Carter excited Graham carries
something in his open hands like youd carry sand

Euclid turns to see whats going on Carter checks out what
Graham has sends them on their way and heads toward Euclid
Except they dont go away

GRAHAM
How come they can do it then

Carter turns back angry in an instant

CARTER
Come here

He grabs Grahams wrists shakes the Detritus to the ground
covers it with snow and pushes Graham on his way

Carter then walks up to Euclid and comments on the plaque
breathless

CARTER
Looks good

INT ALBERTS BARN - NIGHT

In one of the back stalls a SHEET has been used to cover the
TWO CONNECTED FRONDS on the floor Graham and Samuel hold the
sheet up staring underneath Euclid leans against a far
wall uninvolved

Across the stall Carter picks up something hidden beneath some
hay Its a FINGER HUSK from one of the Chorus hands

Graham is fed up again

GRAHAM
Theyre making hands now And we just

Samuel looks to him and shakes his head cautioning him from
speaking Graham reluctantly takes the advice

But from across the stall and with the same despondent tone

CARTER
Theyre making hands now

Graham Samuel and even Euclid look toward him with some
surprise

CARTER
And were just watching them do it Well
they dont have the third one

Graham and Samuel look to each other wondering what hes
referring to

Carter positions himself in front of Euclid
CARTER
That one’s mine I say who uses it or
doesn’t It’s not yours to give away
He turns to the other two
CARTER
Pack those up
EXT FIELD - DAY

Graham waits under a tree looking like hes ready to sprint
into the field from the forest

Samuel under a tree on the opposite side of the field does
the same

Suddenly in the area between them a FUNNEL STACK falls from
the sky CRASHING into the snow The Stack has some kind of
THIN ROPE attached to it

Just as the snow settles ANOTHER STACK drops in followed by
TWO MORE

Graham and Samuel rush in from the trees and hurriedly inspect
the Stacks pushing and prying on each Funnel looking for
signs of age

Samuel is done with his two He yells up the field

SAMUEL
Okay go

GRAHAM
Wait I got one

SAMUEL

Hold on
Graham splits off the Aged Funnel from the Stack and empties
some new replacement Funnels onto the snow from a sack around
his neck He works like a member of a pit crew
CUT TO The 4 Funnel Stacks are reeled in by their ropes to
the launching area They leave trails in the snow as they
drag

At the launching area Carter strains to spin a LARGE WOODEN
SPOOL as fast as he can coiling up the 4 ropes

CUT TO The 4 Funnel Stacks are set up and ready to launch
each spaced about 3 feet from the next Their ropes are in
neat coils next to them

Carter takes a 12-FOOT-POLE and brings it near the Stack The
Pole has 4 Controllers attached along its length each spaced
3 feet from the next

When the Controllers get near enough the 4 Funnel Stacks all
launch at once

They arc high in the sky and then
MATCH CUT TO

an Aged Funnel is brought down hard onto a table smashing
its Detritus off and revealing Petals

We’re in a cave carved into the mountain a few hundred feet
above the valley floor

Carter Graham and Samuel sit on the floor assembling Limbs
from the hundreds of Petals around them

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

Carter sees something at the base of the mountain near the
woods Euclid pulling a wagon sled

CARTER
Euclid Euclid

EXT BASE OF MOUNTAIN FIELD - NEXT

Euclid uncovers the contents of his wagon tens of address
plaques

CARTER
(impressed)
It looks like a whole neighborhood

In the background Graham is leading the Chorus down the
mountain

Carter and Euclid turn to see Samuel 100 feet off just staring
into the woods at something

CUT TO Joining him Carter and Euclid can now see what has
his attention

50 meters off Albert Javier George and Hector stand under a
tree looking up searching its branches Javier points out
something in the tree to George

JAVIER
Right under there where it forks

ALBERT
Bring him around here

Marcus brings their Chorus around We dont see much because
its covered in cowhide

ALBERT
Send him up

With great dexterity the Chorus uses its hands to climb the
tree Again we dont see much Its Hand clings to a branch
Its dark shape moves up through the trees limbs

A FOOTBALL falls to the ground from high in the tree The
kids grab it and run off to resume their game

Carter Euclid and Samuel are left with what theyve seen
Carter speaks with determination

CARTER

INT CLIFF DWELLING - DAY

The Third Frond is slid into place with the other two Fronds
filling in the 13 vacancy

CUT TO The Third Frond has produced what looks like a WHITE
ANGULAR BOWL (a PLATE from now on) Carter is pulling on it
trying to detach it from the Frond with no luck

Samuel and Graham assist trying to get their fingernails
underneath
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

Euclid makes his way up towards the Cliff Dwelling carrying an
AX

INT CLIFF DWELLING - NEXT

Euclid slowly rounds the corner eavesdropping on their
progress He sees

Graham finishes putting together a simple configuration of a
few Petals and rushes it over to Carter

Carter connects this Petal structure (a HANDLE) to the Plate
which is still connected to the Frond There are SIX specific
places on the Plate where the Handles fits perfectly Carter
had already placed Handles on the other FIVE places so now
there are SIX jutting out from the Plate

UT TO Euclid rests against the rock wall 20 feet away

till holding his ax He cranes his neck to see what the
ther three are doing

They have the Chorus lying on its back Carter slides a Plate
across the wood where it fits flush with the Chorus Limb

Graham connects another Plate to the first like a puzzle
piece And another as they start to cover the Chorus belly

The Chorus helps using its arm to resituate one of the
Plates

EUCLID
What do they do

Carter hands a Plate to Samuel
CARTER
(to Samuel)
Here take him this one
(to Euclid)
Its getting easier

Samuel delivers the Plate to Euclid who quickly checks it
over

EUCLID
What are they for though

Carter looks at the Plate trying to form an answer Something
occurs to Euclid

EUCLID (CONTD)
Dont cover it all

Carter understands

CARTER
-right Nowe wont

CLOSEUP Another Plate is added

MATCH CUT TO

The Half-Plated torso of the Chorus clears the frame to reveal
something the Plate has left behind a TUBE with the same
shape as the Plate

WIDE There are actually several Tubes each about two feet
long bundled parallel to each other The Chorus is creating
a PLATFORM extending from the edge of the Cliff The Platform
curves up on the sides

The four kids look on

EUCLID
Okay make him stop

GRAHAM
Hes fine Hes not hurting anything

CARTER
Hell stop Hes being good

Euclid looks to them sees that theyre not going to stop the
Chorus and almost nods okay He goes to the wall and
retrieves his ax

Seeing this Carter wearing the Necklace immediately tries
to reel in the Chorus

CARTER
Come on back

Euclid quickly moves to the Chorus placing the edge of the ax
on a bare patch of wood on its torso ready to draw it back

The Chorus doesnt budge continuing to construct the
Platform

Carter rubs his fingers together trying harder to exert some
control over the Chorus He speaks to it directly

CARTER
Come on
(to Euclid)
Uke give him a second Uke

Euclid brings the ax down hard splitting the top of the
wooden torso The Chorus moves away from its work wandering
back into the dwelling The damage seems to be only cosmetic

CARTER
There Jesus

EUCLID
Did you do it

CARTER
Yes I did it I stopped him

Beat

EUCLID
Make him take one of those things off

Carter looks at him incredulously

CUT TO Euclids fingers hover over the shafts of the
platform

He and Carter lie on their bellies at the edge of the cliff
getting a close up look at the structure

EUCLID
Theres a draft Its cold

Carter nods The tension from the previous scene is gone

CUT TO Carter is standing on the platform The drop off is
10 feet His caution seems to be lessening by the second

Euclid is ready to snatch him back to the cliff

CARTER
Step out

EUCLID
You get back first

CARTER
Its solid Look Its solid

EUCLID
Were idiots

Euclid inches forward nervous and giddy

DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL The SET OF 3 FRONDS quietly churns in
the cave A 6 INCH HEXAGON is growing from its center where
the Leaves of each Frond meet

Back at the ledge Carter kneels spreading a handful of
pebbles in front of some of the shafts that are pointing
sideways where the platform curves up The pebbles are pulled
into the shafts caught up in the draft of wind that
constantly pours through them

MATCH CUT TO

EXT BASE OF MOUNTAIN FIELD - DAY

EUCLIDS HAND spreads dirt and snow near an arc of shafts
above him pointing up It all gets sucked up

WIDE He and Carter stand inside a LONG CYLINDRICAL TUBE with
walls made of the shafts Called a FLUME it is 10 feet in
diameter and 20 feet long They are in the north entrance

CUT TO At the south entrance each tip of Grahams scarf is
being sucked down a different shaft Playing around he prods
the scarf and eventually it goes through one of the holes and
flies out the side of the Flume

He quickly steps out of the Flume shivering

GRAHAM
cant stay in there

Samuel throws an armful of snow and dirt into the Flume where
it gets shot out in all directions creating a cloudy mist
around the cylinder

CUT TO At the north entrance Euclid is clogging one of the
shafts with MUD using a JAGGED 2X4 to apply the stuff and
then force it down

Wind whistles through a small gap where the mud isnt filled
in Euclid takes care of that with a dab that he spreads out

From the south side of the Flume the shafts begin BLOWING OUT
in sequence- just enough to kick up the snow from the ground
outside it All along the length of the Flume shafts blow
nearing the north side where Euclid sits

He notices and waits When the mud-clogged shaft blows it
moves the mud but doesnt seem to be powerful enough to blow
it out completely

SOUTH ENTRANCE Samuel and Graham stand outside the Flume
watching and waiting for the snow to settle

SAMUEL
Is that it

The shafts again begin to blow out in sequence from south to
north this time much more powerfully All of the snow and
some of the earth beneath it get blasted into the air
stirring up a storm of brown and white all along the Flume

We pan with Samuel and Graham as they carefully move to peer
inside the Flumes south entrance trying to see Euclid at the
other end

Euclid is still inside but backing out cautiously When the
sequence gets to him the shafts blow out the mud violently

sending it inside the Flume and out while splintering the 2X4
The small explosion of dirt and wood surrounds Euclid

CUT TO All the snow has settled back to the ground Euclid
lies on his back outside the Flume with his head propped up on
a rolled-up coat Hes got a wet sock covering his eyes
Carter kneels over him picking shrapnel (splinters and
pebbles) from his face with his fingers Euclid winces

CARTER
need some water to clean it outsome
tweezers
Samuel and Graham look on from the side
CUT TO Everyones gone The Flume sits alone in the field

against the dark blue sky

ANOTHER ANGLE Dark night Three kids with flashlights walk
towards the Flume

Albert walks through the Flume studying the shafts running
his fingers along the surface He is flanked by Javier and
George

Samuel stands under a tree at the edge of the woods watching
the lights move through the Flume He turns his attention

towards the sound of
Marcus and Hector are walking towards it

SAMUEL
Dont clog the holes

Surprised they stop and turn their flashlights towards
Samuel

SAMUEL
Dont clog the holes

CUT TO Marcus and Javier are putting the final touches on a
shaft they have clogged with mud and snow Marcus points
outside the Flume needing something

MARCUS
-no get the uh the uhthat

Javier hands him whats left of the 2X4 Marcus uses it to
pack down the mud

INT CLIFF DWELLING - DAY

The Set of 3 Fronds sits alone The Hexagon has grown twice
as wide and to a height of 10 inches

EXT BASE OF MOUNTAIN FIELD - DAY

Near the first Flume the Chorus has started on another Only
it a few feet long it looks like a ring Carter Graham and

Samuel pull on it with ropes It teeters back and forth
before finally falling over

CUT TO Inside the first Flume Euclid (now shrapnel scabs
pepper his face) and Carter look on as the Chorus continues
work on the ring building up now instead of across

CARTER
He doesnt carejust keeps going

Euclid takes a CRUMPLED PIECE OF NOTEBOOK PAPER that Graham
and Samuel are studying and hands it to Carter

EUCLID
Could you do this

It is plans for a type of fort with crudely penciled cylinders
representing Flumes Euclid runs his hands across the Shafts
measuring the space between them with his fingers Carter is
overjoyed with Euclids participation

CARTER
Yeah Yeah we can do- here in the field

EUCLID
No we gotta go into the woods to start
Its no good out here Its all

Through the shafts he sees something far off Carter notices
and keys off him to see

TWO CHORUSES shaped like apes are ambling across the field
towards the mountain Unlike the previous Choruses weve
seen these have BLACK METAL torsos (like a bicycle frame)
instead of wooden ones and each torso has embedded in it a
BLACK METAL CYLINDER the size of a thermos The two are
identical except for their arm Limbs One has an elongated
left arm (LEFT-APE) and the other has an elongated right arm
(RIGHT-APE)

Euclid and Carter are in a mixed state of amusement and shock
They step out of the Flume looking to the woods and all
around for whoever is controlling the Apes

EUCLID
Where are they

CARTER
I dont evenknowwhat is happening

Euclid laughs at how odd this is
PAN TO Carter laughs

PAN TO The Apes have reached the mountain and are now
beginning their ascent

PAN TO Euclid goes serious beginning to realize

PAN TO Carter gets it too

NT CLIFF DWELLING - NEXT

Left-Apes Limb fits into one of the grooves in the Circle
Frond Right-Apes Limb fits into the other groove

The Circle Frond is separated from the other two Fronds and
hauled away

When the Apes get the Frond to the entrance of the dwelling
Carters Chorus POUNCES on Right-Ape from above instantly
bending its metal frame at the shoulder

It continues to BASH away at Right-Apes shoulder as Carter
rises into frame nearing the mouth of the cave controlling
the Chorus

BASH BASH BASH and then the metal finally snaps Right-
Apes Limb still connected to the Frond is severed from its
metal frame

Left-Ape drags the Frond (and Right-Apes severed Limb)
outside

Carters Chorus and Right-Ape are locked in a struggle each
gripping the others Hand

From the grip we pan down the length of Carters Chorus to
where the Limb meets the Plates of its torso It is solid
even under the strain

We start at the grip again but this time pan down the length
of the Apes Limb to where it meets its metal frame The
metal is BENDING under the stress

INT and EXT FLUME - INTERCUT

We see the Flume from above It and everything around it is
entirely peaceful In direct contrast to the previous scene
this (and every time we cut back here) is calm and understated
like a nature documentary

A HAWK flies over It snatches a FIELD MOUSE from the snow
A SPIDER spins a WEB across the ceiling arc of the Flume
The web is buffeted by the constant airflow through the
shafts

The hawk now perched on the top of the Flume stabs down with
its beak into the mouse in its talons It stabs again
tearing away flesh And again

Euclid brings his AX down with a CLANK on the metal frame of
Left-Ape Its trying to escape down the mountain but only
managing a crawl due to the Frond its dragging
Euclid is relentless with the ax CLANK CLANK CLANK
Graham and Samuel wait behind some rocks ready to rush in

A BOLTED JOINT on the frame is bending about to come apart

Before that can happen Left-Ape removes its Limb from the
Frond and turns toward Euclid

Euclid backs away Left-Ape follows him limping It spends
as much energy compensating for its wobbly frame as it does
walking

Graham and Samuel sweep in grab the Frond and run off with
it

up and over the mountain Then it turns and limps down the

A FOX runs along the forest line It crosses over to inspect
the Flume sniffing inside a few of the shafts

The spider is gently blown along a shaft until it reaches the
end and falls out landing in the snow next to several other
SMALL FROZEN BUGS AND RODENTS that have been expelled from the
Flume

The fox feasts on this treasure trove of food

Nearby TWO DEAD MICE lie just inside a shaft facing the snow
outside

MATCH CUT TO

NORTH ENTRANCE Graham and Samuel sit just inside the Flume
with the Frond watching out for

Left-Ape limps across the field towards the Flume Euclid
runs alongside it at a distance watching it waiting for the
right moment He yells after Graham and Samuel

EUCLID
Take it through to the other end

Graham and Samuel take the Frond deeper into the Flume

Euclid checks behind him Carter and his Chorus have just
descended to the base of the mountain chasing Right-Ape
towards the Flume

Focusing again on Left-Ape Euclids moment comes and he kicks
down hard on its wounded metal shoulder finally snapping a
bolt in two so that the Limb hangs loose useless

Left-Ape compensates with its other Limbs to regain its
stance In the process its newly exposed metal slices a gash
in Euclids leg

SOUTH ENTRANCE A SHAFT is being stuffed with mud rocks and
snow by Graham and Samuel The Frond sits nearby

Now inside the Flume Euclid limps toward the south entrance
Left-Ape is right behind him still pursuing the Frond

Euclid turns around lifts up the edge of a plywood
floorboard slides his bent knees under it and waits

The first shaft blowouts begin at the south entrance and move
north Graham and Samuel step away from the Flume now done
with their work

Left-Ape reaches the plywood board just as the shaft blowouts
get there They are harmless but stir up a lot of dirt
Euclid kicks the plywood up and turns it over slamming Left-
Ape into the Flume wall

Right-Ape reaches the north entrance with Carters Chorus
right behind it trying to grab it

Carter running comes to a breathless stop near the Flume
He sees the blowouts coming towards him and then peers into
the Flume to see

Euclid lying on his back kicks against Left-Apes frame to
jam the metal further into the space between the shafts Two
of its Limbs are flailing about inside shafts and Euclid
kicks a third to get it stuck as well

Carter raises his arms operating the Chorus
The Chorus grabs Right-Apes frame and forces it to the

ceiling Right-Apes Limbs wind up inside shafts The first
set of blowouts reach the north entrance

Euclid gives one last kick to make sure Left-Ape is stuck in
the Flume wall and then runs out the south entrance covering
his face with his arms

The second blowouts start violently shooting out all the
clogged mud and rocks stirring up the soil outside

Displaced air echoes like a drum moving down the length of
the Flume BOOM BOOM BOOM They approach Left-Ape
W
W

e see one of its Limbs silhouetted against the translucent
all of the shaft around it (like bee larva inside a hive)

When the blowout comes the Limb is pulled with great force
but doesnt get expelled This is accompanied by a high-

pitched WHISTLING almost a scream
T

he Limb gets jammed even tighter The whistling grows higher
in pitch until

From outside the Flume we see a BLACK SPHERE 6 feet in
diameter pop into existence around the Limb Like a depth
charge it pushes everything around it outward for a fraction
of a second before pulling everything inward creating a sort

of implosion as it pops back out of existence This all takes
half a second

The whole process is repeated several more times as a few
Black Spheres appear wherever a Limb is stuck in a shaft

We see the Limb silhouette again It loses a Flower each time
a Sphere appears getting shorter and shorter

At a safe distance Euclid Graham and Samuel are drawn in by
the implosions both physically and mentally They fall to
their knees and are then gently slid forward by the unseen
force

One of the Spheres intersects with the ground leaving behind
nothing but a spherical depression

Graham whispers involuntarily at the destruction

GRAHAM
Yes

Meanwhile the blowouts continue toward Right-Ape at the north
entrance

Euclid drags Graham and Samuel away from the Flume timing his
effort so as not to fight the waves of implosions He pulls
then waits for a wave to pass then pulls then waits again
Carter backs away from the Flume as well anticipating

The Black Spheres appear around Right-Apes Limbs synced with
audio from the next scene POUND POUND POUND

Someone moves into frame behind him

Marcus races into the room and grabs the Necklace causing

the Chorus to flex hard and jump which shakes the cage
violently throwing back Euclid and Graham

it He repeatedly smashes Marcus’ arm into the wall until the
Necklace drops on a nearby table

Vaughn as he slowly thinks it through

Vaughn kneels to scoop up the toolbox still not completely
clear He walks out with it

DEEPER IN THE CAVE Samuel empties the white sack full of the
Apes metal frame pieces He picks through them checking
each for usefulness until he gets to the metal cylinder which
seemingly has no function He holds it up

EXT WOODS - NEXT
Vaughn and George are trying to pry open the toolbox with a
LARGE SCREWDRIVER and HAMMER Vaughn hammers BANG BANG
BANG Its not happening He sits back giving up
Out of anger he raises the hammer up one more time

Using one of the metal frame pieces Samuel CRACKS the
cylinder open long ways and the top half swings over on a
hinge revealing whats inside

Hes puzzled by what he sees

INT ALBERTS BARN - NEXT

Frustrated Vaughn drops the toolbox (dented now from the
prying) on the ground in front of Albert and heads out He
yells back

VAUGHN
You got two days

Albert unlocks his padlock and opens the toolbox Hes a bit
overwhelmed at the sight of the Frond He places his hand on
it and lets it linger Everything is right with the world

MATCH CUT TO

INT EUCLIDS HOUSE PORCH - NIGHT

Euclid kneeling in front of the cylinder places his hand
inside it Samuel sits next to him

Euclid cant wrap his head around what he pulls out a
Controller dripping wet

CLOSE UP Inside the cylinder is a series of Controllers
each of which is contained in a metal compartment full of
CLEAR LIQUID Holes have been drilled in the Discs so that
WIRES can run through the length of them Euclid carefully
removes the series with both hands and places it on the floor

He cocks his head seeing something else inside the now-empty
cylinder

CLOSE UP Euclids hand pushes a metal fitting aside to
reveal a CRUDELY STAMPED LOGO gbpa Each letter is made of
a hexagon

HANDS TIE A ROPE KNOT around a bit of rebar jutting up from
concrete

SAMUEL (OFF SCREEN)
said there was a sleepover

EUCLID (OFF SCREEN)
Shell call to check on you

Euclid pulls on the rope to test the knot Hes got a pack
with a rolled up SLEEPING BAG on his back

SAMUEL (OFF SCREEN)

EXT HUGE CONCRETE HOLE - DAWN

AT THE TOP

The two stand at the edge of the hole Along the interior are
partial RAILINGS and SCAFFOLDING and every 20 feet or so are

RINGS of concrete on which to climb down to

SAMUEL
What did you tell your mom

EUCLID
Nothing Im getting in trouble

Euclid throws the rope down preparing to descend

PARTWAY DOWN Samuel drops onto a platform from the rope
joining Euclid who with a few expert tugs and knot work is
able to pull the rope down to use again

ANOTHER LEVEL They eat FRIED CHICKEN from aluminum foil
Euclid gets the rope ready for the next descent

NIGHT

ANOTHER LEVEL A SMALL ELECTRIC LANTERN is their only source
of light as they lie in sleeping bags

DAY

AT THE BOTTOM They walk into the center slowly searching
the ground which is covered in discarded construction
materials Euclid holds in front of him a 6-foot length of
rebar with a WATER BOTTLE tied to the far end

The water in the bottle starts to BOIL They both stop in
their tracks and search the area around them

SAMUEL
There

He points it out wedged between some broken concrete is a
chopped-off Finger (from one of the Chorus Hands) dropped here
the year before

Samuel SPRAY PAINTS an arc at their feet marking the danger
zone around the Finger

They move away from the danger zone still searching

CUT TO They crouch to the ground finding the cracked-open
Governor

Euclid checks the dirty weathered inner lining running his
hands over it He rubs at a spot for a moment before

EUCLID
Give me some of that water
INT ALBERTS BARN - DAY
Vaughn stands waiting near the toolbox Albert sits off to
the side thinking Behind him are several newly made Funnel

Stacks

Marcus places the Frond inside the toolbox and looks back to
Albert for instructions

VAUGHN
Is it ready to go or what

Albert turns to Javier They dont say a word but its clear
theyre contemplating something

VAUGHN
Arent you supposed to lock it You dont
want meyou know

EXT CLIFF DWELLING - NEXT

Euclid and Samuel return with the Governor They come upon
Vaughn and George staring at some scene inside the cave

Moving past they halt upon seeing Albert Marcus and Javier
standing in front of Carter and Graham

Albert holds the Frond He turns to Euclid

ALBERT
Im sorry We shouldnt have made those
things and tried to steal this We should
have just asked because you guys would
have been nice about it probably But we
were stupid and I wish- we wish we hadnt
done it now And were sorry

He checks Marcus and Javier to see if they have anything to
add but they stay silent and keep their heads down

Euclid is dumbfounded Carter takes the Governor from him

CLOSEUP On the GREASY BLACK inside lining Euclid points out
a cleaned-up area where we see another gbpa™ LOGO

CARTER
Same letters

Euclid nods still not knowing what to do with Alberts false
confession

INT CLIFF DWELLING - NEXT
Carter holding the series of the Apes Controllers removes a

large part of the Limb that is still attached to the Circle
Frond He showing the others what to do

CARTER
-and take a piece from ours and put that
in there

JAVIER

Gotcha and just every other one

CARTER
Yeah

All ten of the kids begin constructing a HYBRID of the Ape and
Carters Chorus

Through this commotion we focus on Albert In between
exchanging a piece with another kid and answering a question
he manages to look around the room observing it from a
distance With a half-smile his eyes water a bit

CUT TO The SERIES of Controllers goes back in the metal
cylinder which then SNAPS SHUT

EXT WOODS - NEXT

The Hybrid (not much more than the original Ape Limb and two
shorter legs) drags the Circle Frond awkwardly crawling

forward at a foot a second

The ten kids slowly follow behind it

EXT HILLSIDE - NEXT

Albert is holding up the other side of the Circle Frond to
help the Hybrid They are able to manage a normal walking
speed this way

Vaughn comes up to relieve him taking hold of the Frond
VAUGHN
Jeez how far are we going
EXT FIELD - NEXT

The ten stand in a circle letting the Hybrid inch along by
itself for a second

Euclid has his hand on Samuels shoulder

EUCLID
Me and Sammy gotta go back
HECTOR
I do too
GEORGE
Yeah
MARCUS
Im just over the hill there I still got
time

VAUGHN
Im still going

CUT TO 3 groups split off Euclid and Samuel go one way
Hector George Javier and Graham go another Carter
Vaughn Marcus and Albert continue following the Hybrid

Something occurs to Euclid He leaves Samuel for a moment and
runs after Marcus grabbing him by the coat sleeve

EUCLID
Your cameras at your house

MARCUS
Yeah what

Euclid drags him to Carter and tells them both
EUCLID
Shes not gonna let me out for a long
time

INT EUCLIDS BEDROOM - DAY

Euclid is VACUUMING Behind him Carter comes to the window
and knocks but we can’t hear it over the noise

CUT TO Euclid opens the window letting Carter in He has
let the vacuum continue to run

Carter hands him a crumpled envelope of PHOTOS and moves to
Euclids dresser to open a drawer

Euclid flips through the photos which are all taken from a
ridge overlooking an ENCAMPMENT

PHOTO We see one LARGE TENT in the middle and SEVERAL
SMALLER TENTS surrounding it CAMPERS walk to and fro

PHOTO CHORUS APES return from the outskirts in pairs and are
directed by Campers into a PEN where ANOTHER 20 are kept

Carter comes to Euclids side and speaks directly into his ear
but is barely heard over the vacuum

CARTER
They kept coming out of the trees
Theyre looking for it All of them

PHOTO Behind the large tent stands a RADIO TOWER 50 feet

high It has a unique silhouette with a few METAL TRIANGLES
above a SPHERICAL TRANSMITTER

CARTER
Here

Carter is holding out one of the PAPER CUPS with the dried
blood on it Beyond him Euclid sees the other cups that have
been sorted through on the dresser

He takes the cup and holds it next to the photo of the radio
tower Rotating the cup around he sees an exact match the
dried blood sketch is the same as the large tent and radio
towers silhouette

The VACUUM NOISE becomes

EXT FLUME FIELD - DAY

the NOISE of TEN CHORUSES DIGGING a tunnel 10 feet in
diameter and slanted into the earth Some are dog-sized A
couple are as big as horses Bits of earth and debris go
everywhere

It’s SUMMER again Everyone sweats

Vaughn is controlling a few of the Choruses as well as
supervising Hector Marcus and Javier who in turn control
theirs

Vaughn gives George and Samuel instructions but we can’t hear
over the noise The two take off down the ramp of another
already-dug tunnel leading in the opposite direction

50 feet further we see them emerge on the surface through yet
another ramp George grabs a YARDSTICK before they disappear
underground again We can now see that there are several
RAMPS leading to the same tunnel that loops back on itself in
a GIANT CIRCLE

Vaughn commands everyone

VAUGHN
Haul it out Haul everything out Let’s
calm them down Everything goes calm now

The frenzy of digging comes to stop The Choruses haul out
large palettes of fresh soil at half-speed Everything goes
quiet

The kids stare at the circular wall of earth still waiting to

be dug through Javier produces from his pocket a WAD OF
STRING with a SMALL WEIGHT tied to the end

CUT TO George and Samuel are on the other side They use
the yardstick to measure from the tunnel floor to the center
of the earth wall

George plants a pole (the end of a shovel) in the wall at that
point and they both push and twist it through what must be
several feet of dirt

CUT TO The pole emerges on the other side Javier quickly
wraps a loop of his string around it and drops the weight
The string goes taut and the weight touches the floor

Javier climbs up and tests the length of the string at two
other points around the wall before declaring the results

JAVIER
Nailed it Dead center

VAUGHN
Okay let’s get ‘em up Push through

CUT TO A SHORT FLUME (5 feet long) is tilted and then
dragged with rope into the dug-out tunnel by a team of
Choruses and kids

CUT TO Choruses add shafts to the Flume Tunnel extending
its length The white symmetric shafts line the tunnel in
stark contrast to the black soil

INT CLIFF DWELLING - DAY

SEVERAL SETS OF FRONDS are spaced around the room quietly
churning Some sets have two Fronds some three

Albert and Graham tend to them sifting sawdust from a large
bin

Carter checks each Frond for new pieces gathering them like
fruit into THREE BAGS that hang from his waist

CUT TO PLATES are being attached to a wooden torso like
jigsaw puzzle pieces A human hand and a Chorus Hand work
together to complete it The last plate is put in place

WIDE Carter and Marcus leave the Chorus in the middle of the
room watching it from a safe distance

CARTER
And just drop the necklace Let him do it
on his own

Marcus reluctantly tosses his Controller Necklace in the
corner

The Chorus expands and contracts its Limbs flexing and testing
its new Plate shell

It walks to the near wall and jostles it like it might be
trying to scratch an itch on its torso It taps the wall
again And again harder each time

CARTER
Don’t stop him

he Chorus BANGS the hard rock with its torso It backs up a
ew feet and launches at the wall growing more violent
ventually it runs back and forth between the two walls
LAMMING itself hard using its powerful Limbs We hear LUMBER
RACKING the entire time

QumaMhHyH

he Chorus comes to rest It leans forward and shakes a
ittle letting SPLINTERS DUST and WOODEN BITS from its old
orso empty out of its new white torso

UT TO Albert Hector and Graham harvest a new CIRCLE FROND
hat is growing out of the center of a set of three Fronds

tQ ftrRH

Albert and Graham set it aside Hector crouches near the set
of three trying to solve something When Albert and Graham
notice him he looks back with a puzzled face

They crouch next to Hector who is subconsciously tracing the
edges of the hole that ejects Plates on the third Frond

HECTOR
They didn’t have plates

Albert and Graham are lost but willing to go along Hector
stares at the three Fronds

HECTOR (CONTD)
The ones you guys fought

Albert looks to Graham the expert
GRAHAM
No they didn’t We did We had some
but they didn’t

Albert looks to the Fronds putting something together in his
head He realizes something we won’t get until later

ALBERT
Oh

EXT FLUME FIELD — DAY

Marcus and George are sweaty and tired Their shirts are
filthy They rest on their backs next to the original FLUME
still above ground

They look at the shafts just above their heads waiting for
SNOWFLAKES loft gently out of the shafts and then fall on

their heads They catch the flakes with their tongues We
eavesdrop

MARCUS
they made them for uscause of how
hot it is

GEORGE

But they started making them when it was
cold There was already snow on the

ground

MARCUS
Yeah but they were born in summer so they
know

Javier arrives at the interior of the Flume to relieve Samuel
who we now see has been SPRAYING WATER MIST into the shafts
with a SPRAY BOTTLE

Samuel happily takes his turn under the snow

ENTRANCE TO UNDERGROUND TUNNEL All ten of the kids straggle
into the tunnel stopping to don PARKAS and WOOLEN HATS
collected from a LARGE BOX at the entrance

CUT TO The entire tunnel is now lined with Flume Shafts As
the kids descend the first ramp we hear the collective noise
of the SHAFTS gently blowing

CUT TO The kids walk across a horizontal stretch of tunnel
The WIND NOISE grows louder

VAUGHN
(off screen)
Whatever happensif it’s a fightwe
have to get them all

CUT TO They descend another steep ramp down a story Wind
is even louder Hair gets tussled

VAUGHN (CONTD)
(off screen)
If we leave any theyll just keep
coming

CUT TO We’re at the intersection of several Flumes The
kids have to shout over the deafening noise of the gale that
blows through the place stirring up eddies of loose dirt

Vaughn is finishing a presentation to the other nine

VAUGHN (CONTD)
»itll never stop And this is the only
way to do it This plan is the only way

A scan of the room shows that everyone is hesitant to go along
with whatever Vaughn is suggesting

Hector steps into the center of the space nervous There’s a
set of THREE FRONDS on the floor Vaughn yields the floor
stepping aside

Hector holds up a PLATE so that everyone can see before
blurting out

HECTOR
Those adults don’t have plates
(he points to the Circle Frond)
So we give them this bit back and they’11
go away

And that’s it He steps back into the ranks

Everyone’s dumbfounded Shouts erupt “What” “What does
that mean” “What does that have to do with plates”

Albert leads Hector back to the center and explains for him

ALBERT

(pointing to the third Frond)
If they don’t have plates it’s gotta be
because they don’t have this one the one
that makes them

(point to all three Fronds)
If they never had that then they never
had all three Theyre stuck They cant
make any more

(points to the Circle Frond)
So they’ve only had one of these

George puts it together

GEORGE
And we have it

ALBERT
and we have it

MARCUS
Well holy shit Just give it back then
Let’s just give it back to them We’ve
got plenty

Everyone talks at once mostly supporting the idea Off to

the side Carter turns to Euclid

CARTER
Is that right

”

Euclid shakes his head “no watching the others talk

CARTER (CONTD)
Why didn’t those things have plates

Euclid looks directly at him He seems to have an answer
would rather quiz Carter
EUCLID
Why do you think
CARTER
What Me
EUCLID
Yeah
CARTER
Uhthey didn’t figure it all out We
did
EUCLID
But they’re adults
CARTER

It doesn’t mean they’re smart like
usall the things we had to figure out

Carter turns to the group and listens to what has become an
argument Euclid just stares at him Carter notices this out

of the corner of his eye and turns back to understand

but

Off screen we hear “then we give it back to them and if they

don’t go away then they deserve it”

REMOTE PART OF THE TUNNEL Vaughn having a cigarette
Javier are alone talking It’s quieter

and

VAUGHN
Theyre not gonna just go away

JAVIER
No Theyre not

Euclid leads Carter up through some boulders

CARTER
Are you really gonna do it What Vaughns

CARTER

I know me too He’s raving I just
wanted to make sure-

Euclid stops them both turning to talk

EUCLID
Why are you asking me that Why are you
asking what I’m gonna do I’m following

Carter’s shocked

CARTER
Wh- why are you doing that I thought-

EUCLID
Are you really gonna do what he’s saying

Carter stammers a little

EUCLID (CONTD)
What are you gonna- what are we doing

CARTER
If they come and try to take what’s ours
well fight them Thatd bewe have
tobut no Vaughns raving with that

Euclid agrees nodding slightly

CARTER (CONTD)
Is that right
EUCLID
I’m following you What do we do

Carter’s lost Euclid leads him through it point by point

EUCLID (CONTD)
Do we let him do his plan or

CARTER
Stop him

EUCLID
How do we do that

CARTER
I have to talk to him

EUCLID
Do you think he’1ll listen to you

CARTER
I’11 make him listen

EUCLID
(clarifying)
Do you think he’1l do what you say
Carter realizes

CARTER
He thinks I’m a bully

Euclid agrees and waits for the solution practically coaxing
each word out

CARTER (CONTD)

EXT ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS - DAY

SAMUEL nervously approaches

A CAMPER with GREEN PANTS sits on a boulder pouring coffee

from a thermos We only see his bottom half but its
to get that Samuel has startled him

enough

Samuel holds up a single FLOWER PIECE and makes a motion with

his other hand follow me

Green Pants doesnt Samuel tries again not understanding

what the hold up is

The man crouches to the ground and draws FOUR HEXAGONS in the

dirt with his finger 0 0 0 o

Samuel stares at the dirt and then at Green Pants before he
gets it He kneels and adds straight lines to each of the

hexagons making the lower case letters g b p a

Samuel stands confident that he has passed the test
makes the hand sign again follow me

EXT HIGH RIDGE - NEXT

JAVIERS RIGHT HAND makes the same motion

His head follows a pair of APES which are navigating
forest floor a hundred feet below on the left side of
ridge They lead two CAMPERS

Javier turns to the right side of the ridge where far
him a Chorus with a Circle Frond strapped to its side

He

walks in

his direction controlled by someone unseen He motions
keep coming

When the Chorus gets close enough the Apes suddenly turn in
the direction of the Frond even though they are separated from
it by the ridge Seeing this Javier gives the hand sign to
halt and then waves the Chorus back sending it away from the
Apes

The Campers turn to follow the Apes One of them relays
information on a piece of equipment made up of a TYPEPAD and
an ANTENNA

Keying off this Javier checks the horizon and notices another
pair of Apes even further away that are now altering course to
follow the Frond

EXT CLEARING - NEXT

Samuel leads Green Pants to a BLANKET neatly laid in the
grass The Governor lies ajar on the blanket

Marcus watches from deep in the woods His large Chorus sits
next to him

EXT CANYON - NEXT
Javiers Circle Frond sits on the ground

FOUR APES enter the narrow canyon in pairs approaching the
Frond

100 feet further Javier walks towards them from the opposite
direction out in the open

The shoulders of TWO CAMPERS enter frame still some ways off
from the Apes

Two of the Apes try to line up on either side of the Frond
when Javiers voice echoes through the canyon

JAVIER
Set get ready toFLY

Suddenly the place becomes a war zone Tens of Funnel Stacks

launch from every direction at once hidden behind rocks and
in crevasses The air is instantly filled with these bullet-

fast 50-pound rockets slamming the Apes into the canyon
walls Debris flies everywhere

EXT ENCAMPMENT - NEXT

Green Pants carries the Governor towards the LARGE TENT
passing other CAMPERS that make way for him Some of them
SIGN to each other None speak

Walking at his side Samuel eyes dart around taking in the
camp from this new perspective

He sees the PEN holding all the Apes They turn in the
direction of the Frond as it passes
NT LARGE TENT - NEXT

Samuel is led into the center of the space 40 CAMPERS line
the edges of the room waiting for him in total silence

Hes understandably uneasy Maybe because its the only thing
he can think of he makes the sign language for thank you

Suddenly two campers bolt across the room towards a back
exit Another quickly moves to a DARK ROOM on the right
More and more get up and exit the tent in a rush

EXT ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS - NEXT

Marcus is keeping an eye on the large tent with binoculars

He sees campers move to the pen to open the gate

He pans over to the woods to see TWO CAMPERS receive a
message on their TYPEPAD They sign to each other rein in
their Apes and hurriedly lead them in a specific direction

INT LARGE TENT - NEXT

Left alone except for a GUARD at the front entrance Samuel
tries to make sense of where everyone has gone

He slowly steps towards the dark room revealing
»a control room where several campers are surveying MAPS and
operating TYPEPADS and RADIO EQUIPMENT In the middle of the

room is a DARK BROWN BOX 4-foot square A couple campers
move to place one of their hands on it

Samuel focuses on the man closest a RADIO OPERATOR He wears
a headset with an EARPIECE that fits just behind the ear
rather than inside the ear canal

CLOSE UP The earpiece is vibrating against his skull making
a BUZZING sound

Samuel turns to the brown box

CLOSE UP Near the box PEBBLES on the ground are vibrating

He moves toward the box and as he does we begin to hear a LOW
PITCHED VOICE growing in volume

VOICE
were not as smart as we thought we
could never get them to mind

Samuel places his hand on the box joining the others
Through BONE INDUCTION the Voice comes in much clearer and
appropriately pitched sounding almost like a child

VOICE

whats gonna happen but
Samuels head jerks as he recognizes the voice

Samuel sees text appear on the machine in front of Radio
Operator converge on e5-12

He looks over to a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP in time to see someones
hand running down the E5 column and drawing a BIG RED CIRCLE
around the appropriate square

Samuel backs away scared He checks the campers and sees
nothing but the backs of their heads

So he yells at the top of his lungs
SAMUEL

Radio Operator turns around in his chair to investigate
looking directly at Samuel

Samuel looks back at him worried and surprised that he
noticed

Radio Operators gaze

Radio Operator stands from his chair

Samuel looks to the table where the Frond sits Radio
Operator does too

Samuel looks in the opposite direction toward the tents exit
where a GUARD stands just inside Radio operator looks too

When he looks back he sees that Samuel is looking down
considering something Suddenly Samuel heads to a table
behind him and dives under it

Confused Radio Operator looks to the exit just in time to see
Marcus Chorus SLAM THROUGH the tent with its Limbs spread
out taking down everything within 10 feet including the
Guard

From under the table Samuel sees all the men in the control
room wake up to the situation and half-surround half-flee from
the Chorus

The Chorus moves through the room with its Limbs outstretched
ready to strike

EXT FLUME FIELD - NEXT

Inside the underground tunnel Euclid stares out at the field
through the shafts stepping toward them slowly He eyes
something approaching He speaks without emotion to Carter
who has his back turned to the field oblivious

EUCLID
I didnt solve anything

CARTER
What

EUCLID

I didnt really sol- I just kept trying
different thingswith all the pieces
And then it worked finally

Behind Carter we see the far off SHAPES of the adults
converging on the field

CARTER

Wellisnt that what everybody does-
EUCLID

Im not really that smart I didnt solve

anything
Carter finding this absurd tries to be understanding

CARTER
Okay

He finally turns to what Euclid has been staring at

FIELD We are in the midst of the CAMPERS with Javier as they
enter as a group The aboveground Flume lies a couple hundred
feet ahead

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNEL Graham Hector George and
Albert peek out through exposed shafts seeing the adults
advance Albert notices something strange off to the side of
the field

In the trees Vaughn moves parallel to the campers

ALBERT
Whats he doing

GEORGE
Why isnt he down here with us

Graham checks the campers and sees

GRAHAM
Javier

Albert turns too and sees Javier walking among the adults

GEORGE
Why isnt he down here

GRAHAM
Theyre supposed to be

Albert shows some hesitationfear He sets off along the
tunnel agitated

ALBERT
What are we doing

FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL Carter and Euclid silently watch the
adults approach

Carter inches backward worried

CARTER
Is that more than you thought

Euclid carefully grabs the back of Carters collar and subtly
pushes him forward back in place

EUCLID
No

They turn down the tunnel to see Albert and the rest
approaching Their Choruses follow behind them big enough to
block out most light but gracefully silent moving like
massive white octopuses

CARTER
(whispering)
What are they doing Go back

Again he is inching backwards as he speaks

Euclid coaxes him forward Carter looks at Euclids hand
gripping his jacket

Albert arrives distressed

ALBERT
Vaughns out there Is it still happening
or what are we doing This whole thing is
getting a little-

Carter gets in Alberts face going from timid to a hawk in
instant

CARTER
Stop Stop whining Right now We
already did this If theyre herethat
means

He stammers and tries a different direction

CARTER
We tried to just give it to them but
thats not good enough-

He tries one more direction

CARTER
They tried to steal from us We already
decided this

Carter puts out a finger like hes going to name number one
a list of items

Marcus is distracted looking at the large tent He sees a
POSSE of EIGHT CAMPERS exits hurriedly and runs in our
direction

Samuel gets his attention
SAMUEL

What Whats happening
EXT FLUME FIELD - NEXT

A MANS HAND seeks something through the air eventually
reaching the above-ground Flume

WIDE The Campers are in the center of the field circling
the Flume studying it

A 35MM CAMERA is produced

One man LEADER surveys the surface of the Flume with his
hand He turns to see

From one of the underground tunnels Carter rides out on his
horse-sized Chorus hanging to its side like a trolley

He dismounts challenging them with his stance

Nothing happens for a moment The adults all turn to face
Carter but just stand there waiting

Carter sends his Chorus to attack the nearest two APES
The Apes dont present much of a challenge and mostly try to

move out of the way The Chorus repeatedly STABS at LEFT-
APES torso trying to get to the Controller Cylinder

WIDE The adults continue to take no action just watching
the melee from the side

Eventually Glasses instructs another camper TRAINER to back
the Apes off Trainer operates a REMOTE causing

-Right-Ape to retreat 20 feet and settle

Left-Ape isnt so lucky It struggles to free itself but
doesnt make it far before the Chorus finally gets its aim
right and stabs right through the Apes Cylinder The FLUID
inside sprays and the Controllers bleed out

The Chorus releases Left-Ape which slowly gets back on its
feet

Carter watches as Left-Ape sort of meanders not having a
clear direction Suddenly it sprints a few feet in a random
direction then stops and turns

Carter looks to Trainers remote Frustrated Trainer is
trying to get Left-Ape to join Right-Ape waving the remote in
that direction

Left-Ape does not obey In fact it takes a few steps away

After a few seconds Glasses instructs Trainer with a hand
motion SPLAYING HIS FINGERS

Trainer flips open a compartment on the remote revealing TWO
ORANGE BUTTONS He pushes the left one

A SPRING LOADED HINGE on Left-Apes torso POPS open releasing
several BOLTS from their CLAMPS

All of Left-Apes Limbs fall off detached from its metal
torso lLeft-Ape collapses in pieces

With that done Carter grips his Controller necklace and looks
to Right-Ape His Chorus gallops towards it attacking

In two swift blows the Chorus severs one of Right-Apes front
Limbs leaving behind a protruding metal stump

Glasses has had enough He marches towards Carter waving his
hand cut it out give me that

Vaughn watches from the woods and sees that everyone is
distracted His moment comes He sends his Chorus in
running directly at the campers

Javier notices this peeking out from the adults while their
attention is in the opposite direction

We follow Glasses towards Carter 10 feet away now Carter
doesnt budge wanting a confrontation

Suddenly Carters Chorus fills the frame VIOLENTLY DRIVING
Glasses into the ground with the force of a speeding bus

Javier takes a step away from the group preparing for the
approach of Vaughns Chorus We can hear GALLOPING

Beard reaches his arm out to retrieve Javier
Vaughns Chorus SNAPS Beards arm breaking bone

The Chorus spins around allowing Javier to climb on to the
STRAPS hanging from its torso before riding out the way it
came in

Carter stares at Glasses As the Chorus lifts itself off of
him we can see the damage His chest is compressed his
limbs are twisted and broken and a good part of him is pushed
into the earth Hes in shock and beginning to understand
that he is dead

He coughs the first sounds weve heard from him as Carter
cocks his head in curiosity at his first kill

As Javier rides away on the side of Vaughns Chorus he looks
back at Beard writhing on the ground with campers coming to
his aid

The adults bring in all the Apes creating a tight perimeter
around them

They start to back away as a group

We follow a Chorus carrying Hector and George from the dark of
the tunnel and up the ramp to the surface flanking the
adults

Hector pulls a blanket off the Chorus revealing a Circle
Frond held close to it by a pair of simple Limbs

nq

wo of the Apes turn towards it but maintain their position

Then one by one Albert Graham and Euclid ride out on their
Choruses each holding another Circle Frond They have
surrounded the adults

The Apes all turn towards the Frond closest to them
Graham backs away grabs his necklace and wills his Chorus to

kneel and release its Frond on the ground The Chorus then
retreats joining him

TWO APES immediately sprint towards Graham’s released Frond

Albert Euclid and Hector do exactly as Graham did their
Fronds are placed on the ground each attracting TWO APES

he adults are left defenseless in the center of the field
hey try their remotes to bring the Apes back but with no
success

hey flip open the compartments on the remotes exposing the
orange buttons FINGERS are poised to press them

Leader assesses the situation He puts his hand over the
orange buttons on Trainers remote keeping him from pressing
them

Graham waits until the two approaching Apes reach his Frond
and then his Chorus attacks with a few lightning fast stabs
leaving the Apes disabled and missing a few Limbs

Alberts Chorus uses its large Hands to squeeze parts of the
Apes metal torsos until they are mangled and unable to
maneuver

Carter sends his Chorus running away from the circle at a full
gallop seemingly to nowhere

Euclid finishes with his two Apes leaving them in pieces on
the ground He turns and notices Carters Chorus in the
distance

It comes to a stop a quarter mile away at a METAL TROUGH
sitting near a SMALL CREEK The water closest to the trough
BOILS

The Chorus deftly kicks a WOODEN COVER off the trough
revealing a HUNDRED DISCARDED CHORUS FINGERS

Euclid positions his Chorus directly in the adults escape
path halting their exit The Chorus paces back and forth
corralling them

Carters Chorus scoops up the trough and heads back towards
the circle

Carter turns from his Chorus to the gathering of men now
trapped by Euclids Chorus He almost smiles at his plan

Then he notices something coming his way

Euclid sees it too Right-Ape its METAL STUMP jutting out
where its Limb used to be runs towards

-Buclids Frond left on the ground

Euclid runs toward the Frond Carter puts himself in Right-
Apes path taking a brave stance like he might just tackle
the Ape by himself

Euclid kicks the Frond so that it falls into the Flume tunnel

With his Chorus approaching quickly in the distance behind
him Carter grabs Right Ape by the torso slowing it for a

second

H

e squeezes the metal frame in his hands and when it

doesnt bend he looks surprised

He realizes his mistake too late Right-Ape turns toward the
Frond indifferently and IMPALES Carters chest with its metal
The Ape moves off Carter slides off the stump
collapsing to the ground

Carters Chorus stumbles Its huge mass skids 50 feet across
the earth until it slows to rest with a Limb covering Carter
The Fingers fly everywhere landing all around them both

Vaughn runs cautiously to Euclid who is still on his knees
holding out his Necklace

VAUGHN
Uke Uke

Euclid doesnt notice him at his side for a moment and when he
does he only sees Vaughns Necklace He grabs it and without

removing it from Vaughns neck tries to offer it to the
adults

EUCLID
This one too You can take them

VAUGHN
Uke I can do it now

It takes a moment but Euclid eventually understands and
reacts like its the best news hes ever heard He nods
excitedly

Vaughn takes off

Thank you

He turns back to the adults and smiles full of joy

Vaughn runs to meet Javier and George in the underground

into Shafts The Limbs have been placed there in advance all
long the tunnel

CUT TO Javier runs through the tunnel in the opposite
direction doing the same He reaches a STRUCTURE made up of
many Limbs spaced apart evenly He places the structure so
that each Limb falls neatly into a Shaft

On the other side of the tunnel he does the same with another
identical Limb structure He uses a Controller to secure
another Limb between the two structures making it impossible
to remove them from the Shafts

CUT TO Just outside the circle George unfurls an ENORMOUS
FLAG on the ground made up of blankets sewn together with
their original 4H flag The flag is tied with rope to 2
FUNNEL STACKS ready to launch

CUT TO Vaughn reaches an area with a 10X10 FOOT WOODEN BOX
suspended from the ceiling A HANDLE protrudes from the
bottom Underneath that a Limb with a Hand extends from the
ground

Vaughn grabs a nearby Controller Necklace

On the other side of the box Javier arrives done with his
part He gives the go ahead to Vaughn

We hear the dust storm pass over stirring up the landscape
The sound fades to absolute silence

CLOSE ON EUCLID He waits listening Hes lit by ambient
light like moonlight from the horizon

DER He sits there We shouldnt be able to see this much
f him The blanket would have to be much bigger than we know
t is to darken this much space

HO 3

WIDER He sits alone on the mountaintop in darkness Albert
and the others and the Choruses are gone Euclid is
silhouetted by a source of light coming from the valley below

He stands and walks to the edge to see the source of light
revealing

The light is coming from the circle far away It is the one
patch of light in the surrounding black void and so bright
that it looks like daylight down there The EXPLOSION is
frozen in time standing as tall as a skyscraper

Euclid looks around his feet studying the edge of the
precipice

He steadies himself with his hands and extends a leg over the
edge feeling for anything sturdy He looks for a way down
without success

He takes one more look at the valley and then begins to back
up first a few steps and then a quick pace Hes preparing
for a running start

DOLLY ALONG as he runs full speed toward the edge of the
mountain He jumps seemingly into the void but now there is
something there to land on the entrance to a MASSIVE FLUME
200 feet in diameter

WIDE The Flume extends a mile a rigid cylinder starting in
darkness at the top of the mountain and ending near the
lighted circle down in the valley

INT MASSIVE FLUME - NEXT

Euclid stands rising into frame He moves to the left side
of the tunnel

Through the shafts that make up the left wall he sees the
frozen explosion in the Flume Field far below

He looks down at his feet supported by nothing but a grid of
hollow shafts He keeps scanning seeing something incredibly
bright to the right He walks toward it squinting

As we follow him we see only BRIGHT WHITE beyond the shafts
in front of him The source of light grows smaller as Euclid
approaches the tunnel wall until

Suddenly he gets too close and the light shrinks in size toa
pinhole easily seen through one shaft He immediately stops

He takes a step back and the light grows fast filling tens of
shafts There is an inverse relationship between his distance
to the light and its size the shafts are working as lenses

This time Euclid slowly inches forward subtly reducing the
size of the light and bringing it into focus until we can make
out what it is

An area on the ground 200 feet in diameter has retained its
daylight just like the Flume Field At the edge of the lit
circle Samuel and Marcus walk with the campers that were
pursuing them All of them are frozen in mid-step

Euclid looks ahead of them to see where they are heading and
sees Marcus’ disassembled Chorus It is at the center of the
lighted area

Euclid moves slowly along the tunnel wall looking at the same
scene through a second shaft and then a third He halts

He moves back to the second shaft comparing it with the
third The scenes are almost identical except that in the
second Samuel Marcus and the campers have made slightly more
progress towards the Chorus then in the third

He does some more comparison with the first shaft He’s able
to make the group walk forward and backward ever so slightly

Euclid moves along the wall again a little faster The group
walks backwards until they are out of the light completely

Excited Euclid crosses back over to the left side of the
tunnel and runs along it The animated images in the shafts
are disjointed like an old kinetoscope starting out like a
crude cartoon but eventually running at a smooth 24 frames per
second He’s able to see the explosion slowly shrink into the
ground reversing itself

EXT FLUME FIELD - NEXT
Euclid steps out of the Massive Flume onto dark ground

He walks toward and then crosses into Flume Field which is
spot lit with daylight It’s like leaving the dark side of
the moon for the lit side

We are now at the beginning of the implosionexplosion Giant
frozen up-shoots of soil and rocks surround the circle like a
WALL of pillars Euclid tries to find a way through

CUT TO He runs along the curved wall not able to find a
space wide enough to fit through

Eventually the wall leads him to the tree line
CUT TO He moves through the trees still scanning the wall

e finds George’s WARNING FLAG which is now caught up in some
rees and hangs before Euclid like a curtain dividing us from
he interior of the circle The flag is translucent so we are
ble to make out the activity on the other side

otro

Euclid tries to push the thin curtain aside but is surprised
to see it doesn’t budge at all It is as if it were made of
steel a permanent fixture secured in this space He tries
again leveraging his weight against it before giving up and
scanning the area for a tool

CUT TO He pulls with all his might to lift a ROCK from the
ground It too is permanently affixed He moves to a TOOLBOX
and then a nearby piece of LUMBER but cant affect them

UT TO Euclid is in a gap in the up-shoots trying his
ardest to squeeze through He makes it

n mid-air The CAMPERS are motionless forever fleeing the
horuses and Black Spheres

Euclids feet make their way across the center The ground
slowly rises beneath him splitting apart The final
explosion that initially took a tenth of a second is now
elapsing 10000 times slower His feet come to a stop but
continue to be pushed higher inch by inch

Euclid sees what he came for

WIDE We see the entire circle and the frozen melee within
Off to the side is the only perceivable movement Euclid

struggles to lift the Chorus off of Carter’s lifeless body
pinned beneath it

ANOTHER ANGLE We’re a little closer to Euclid He’s still
struggling

ANOTHER ANGLE Closer still He pulls with all his might

EXT SNOWY WOODS —- DAY

A CARIBOU forages A hundred feet beyond it

a HUGE DARK SHAPE 20 feet tall silently approaches
descending from the trees It is a DRAGON-SIZED CHORUS
covered almost entirely with animal pelts

The caribou gets a split-second to react before the Dragon’s
talons each the size of a horse leg bring it to the ground
The Dragon places its weight on the antelope’s torso before
breaking its neck

Euclid Albert Graham Vaughn Hector George and Javier
come forward appearing from behind trees here and there
They’ re weathered looking like they’ve been in the wild for
months

small tents and one common tent surround them

Euclid Vaughn and Albert cover an exposed part of the Dragon
Chorus with caribou skin cutting it to size with a buck
knife

As they sew the skin on with thick twine something causes
them to halt They listen for a second The sound of a
HELICOPTER grows in the distance

Without having to speak they each step back slowly and sit
beneath trees hiding They search the sky This is routine

was put in front of us We weren’tuh
perfect

The kids laugh commiserating

EUCLID
we didn’t always get along and yeah
there were problems We made mistakes
(focuses on Graham)
but we came through Because we had a
system We were orderly And thats why
its different for us

Euclid scans his audience face by face

Because were not just kids We’re not
We figured out this much didnt we So
anyway today Allie’s fourteen

INT EUCLIDS TENT - NEXT

Albert has a seat and watches as Euclid moves about the tent
retrieving and then placing items in front of him The first
is a COFFEE MUG full of water Then a SOCK from his jacket
pocket The third item comes from a SMALL LOCKED CHEST a
stack of PAPER CUPS covered in BLOOD PRINTS like the ones made
several seasons ago

EXT EUCLIDS TENT - NEXT

Euclid leaves the tent walking with a purpose He pulls FIVE
COLORED RIBBONS bunched up from his pocket

As he untangles them he turns and looks up to a HIGH BLUFF
about a mile off and a few hundred feet higher We can just
make out SOMETHING hanging from the bluff

EXT HIGH BLUFF - INTERCUT

Vaughn carries the new Frond on his back toward the edge of
the bluff Graham follows

Hanging from the cliff on a length of rope is a LARGE SACK
made of blankets Its the size of a van and full

EXT SNOWY WOODS - INTERCUT

Euclid walks along some trees looking for the right one
When he finds it we see it has an E etched in it He looks
forward and back guessing distance

Far behind him the Dragon Chorus sits patiently rubbing the
ground with its huge talons Euclid keeps it there

EUCLID
Wait for me Wait

Euclid stashes the Controller Necklace in his pocket and gets
ready to sprint

And hes off running further from the Dragon at top speed

The Dragon begins as well throwing up leaves and debris with
each powerful step It gains on Euclid growing in size until
it seems it might step on him

Euclid grabs the first ribbon GREEN The DRAGON immediately
stops skids a bit and then leaps high above the trees

Euclid watches it rise before taking off in another direction

INT EUCLIDS TENT - INTERCUT

Albert carefully dumps the contents of the sock in front of
him SEVERAL CHUNKS OF DETRITUS and a MARBLE

He compares the marble to each chunk of detritus until he
finds one close to the same size

He scrapes this chunk with a knife until it is exactly the
marbles size

After rolling it around in his hand for a few second he gets
the courage for the next step He takes a gulp of water and
places the detritus chunk directly under his tongue

His eyes flit around wondering is it working yet

As an after thought he grabs the paper cups and positions
them directly in front of him

EXT HIGH BLUFF - INTERCUT

Graham repels down to the large sack Vaughn lowers the Frond
in a makeshift basket that Graham wrangles toward the mouth of
the sack The maneuver takes place a few hundred feet in the
air

EXT SNOWY WOODS - INTERCUT

Euclid holds the green and blue ribbons in a tight fist as he
sprints toward the RED RIBBON at full speed

But after checking over both shoulders he notices that he is
alone He slows a bit as he reaches the ribbon

He scans the area checking the treetops before finally
plucking the ribbon Its a joyless victory

He waits

EXT HIGH BLUFF - INTERCUT

Graham loosens a rope to open the mouth of the sack wide
before dumping the Frond in

Inside the sack we see TENS OF FRONDS

Graham yanks on the baskets rope to signal Vaughn to raise
it

Albert spins one of the paper cups in his hands His fingers
comb over the blood print like a needle on a record

EXT SNOWY WOODS - INTERCUT

runs in his direction

He turns to face it The thunder of the gallop grows louder

EXT ANOTHER WORLD
We PAN ACROSS a FROZEN LANDSCAPE as Albert spins our view

FLAT BLACK ICE is all the way around FLUMES pepper the
surface to the horizon too many to count

For a second we see what might be a structure in the distance
maybe a city Our view spins back in the opposite direction
to investigate but before we can make a judgment the view
changes completely

ANOTHER WORLD

We are high in the atmosphere of a planet entirely covered in
white As we spin we see a CANOPY covering the entire planet
a shell suspended in orbit miles above the surface It is
made of Flumes

Far below on the surface something tiny is moving We manage
to get closer to the CREATURE Its difficult to gauge its
size from this height It moves like a bird with its wings
removed struggling to stay alive under the weight of snow on
its body

ANOTHER WORLD

This one isnt a planet at all but what looks like millions of
BLACK RIBBONS that flow across a space the width of several
solar systems Nestled in its folds are pockets full of
lightscities maybeintelligence

On closer inspection we see FORESTS OF FLUMES covering parts
of the ribbons and what look like WHITE GNATS moving slowly
along them Closer still the gnats are actually Choruses
with hundreds of Limbs They crawl across the long-deserted
structures built by this dead culture

ANOTHER WORLD

A SHIP miles long drifts in deep space It has been cracked
into four large pieces held together only by gravity One
side is covered in a HONEYCOMB of Flumes Chorus pieces drift
free in the space around it There was a battle millennia
ago

ANOTHER WORLD

An enormous OCEAN covered in FLOATING SHEETS OF ICE surrounds
the STAR that it also orbits A CHORUS FISH surfaces and
submerges Its so big that we cant make out its Flowers or
Plates until we move in much closer Water trickles through
them

ANOTHER WORLD

A civilization that developed on a string of ASTEROIDS has
been conquered by the Choruses

And it continues

We see many environments where cultures have risen and are now
left frozen The Choruses are always there

We cut to new views until a rhythm develops once every four
seconds From far off a SWEEPING SOUND rises in volume

THE LAST ONE

A PULSAR SPINS once every four seconds like a swirling light
on a police car

It is surrounded by only dust and atmosphere If there were
ever planets here they have long been decimated

Each rotation of the pulsar ejects radiation that BURNS OFF a
portion of the atmosphere making a brilliant colorful
photochemical effect that accompanies the sweeping sound

SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP
