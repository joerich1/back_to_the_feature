JACK BAKER

out at a dirty city street He is wearing a tuxedo

bedcovers then at the rest of the apartment

the sill

who wore that shit

Jack smiles grabs the paper bag and moves to
the door

GIRL
(continuing)
Hey
(as he stops)
You got great hands

EXT STREET - JACK
Jack aint exactly Cary Grant but any guy wearing
a tux on these streets doesnt exactly mesh with
the milieu Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
all-night liquor store he breaks the seal before
he hits the sidewalk and moves on drinking as he
goes Finally he comes to a nice downtown hotel
Slipping the bottle in his coat he squints up at
the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent

DOORMAN
Hey Jackie

JACK
How goes it Tommy

TOMMY (DOORMAN)
(shrugging)
Ah you know Howsa pooch

JACK
Losing his teeth

TOMMY
No shit Its the goddamn water Kill an ox

Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat

TOMMY

JACK

TOMMY
Like clockwork You got a good
memory Jackie

JACK
It aint always a blessing My
brother here

TOMMY
(nodding)
Hes got blood in his eye
Jack glances at his watch waves to Tommy and
moves into the hotel
INT HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK

Jacks older brother FRANK is pacing outside the
lounge when he sees Jack approaching

FRANK
Great Terrific Glad you could
make it

JACK

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

JACK
(taking out a cigarette)

JACK

nights
FRANK
Jack
JACK
Frank
FRANK
Jack
JACK

Frank Im here I always get
here Dont sweat it
FRANK
Christ will you look at your hair

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jack turns to the wall which is paneled in tiny
tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold

JACK
Whats wrong with it

FRANK
You look like you just crawled out
of bed

JACK
No ones gonna be looking at my
hair Come on were on

Frank just stands there bottled up with
exasperation

JACK

(continuing)
Careful Frank When you get angry your

tie starts to spin

Jack steps into the lounge and Frank shaking his
head follows As they move away a cardboard
stand-up is revealed On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
of Frank and Jack and below printed in bold letters
this Tonight The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
Fabulous Baker Boys

BAKER BROTHERS

as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
and settle behind matching pianos it becomes apparent
that what the Fabulous Baker Boys are in fact is a
poor mans version of Ferrante and Teicher

WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE

As they begin to plink out their theme song tables
of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads
After a few bars the boys finish with a flourish and
the couples applaud
(Mr Smile)
Thank you Thank you Good evening and welcome
to the Starfire lounge My name is Frank Baker
and eighty-eight keys across from me is my
little brother Jack

Applause Little brother Jack smiles winks and takes
a draw on his cigarette

FRANK
(continuing could do this in his sleep)
You know my brother and I have been playing
together gosh I dont know How long has it
been Jack

JACK
Twenty-eight years Frank

Applause

FRANK
Thats a lot of water under the
bridge eh Jack

JACK
Lotta water

FRANK
Of course back then things were a little
different I was eight Jack was seven just
about the only song we knew was My Bonnie
Lies Over the Ocean and the only one who would
listen to us was the family cat Cecil

(to Jack)
We must have shaved three lives off that cat
eh Jack

Laughter Jack smiles like hes got a mouth full of
razor blades

FRANK
(continuing)
But seriously Its been fifteen years since
Jack and I first stepped on the stage as
professionals Three states sixty-eight cities

and more-grayhairs-then-wed-like-to-admit later

well believe me weve seen our share of this
crazy country of ours But even though weve
played some of the finest venues in the world

At this point Jack begins to mimic his brothers words
FRANK

(continuing)
Theres one place thats always been for us
a very special place and that place is this

place the Starfire lounge

Jack lays in a few soft bass chords

FRANK
(continuing)
Why Well I guess you could just say its
the
(pregnant moment)
people

At which point Franks hands descend onto the keyboard
and give birth to the melody of -- what else People

JACK AND FRANK - LATER
They exit the stage to applause

FRANK
Thank you Remember room service is available
till one AM for you late-nighters

INT HOTEL KITCHEN

Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen

FRANK
Dont make trouble all right

JACK
Whos gonna make trouble
(spotting someone)
Hey amigo

HECTOR (MAN)
(re the soup bone)

JACK

FRANK
(as they exit)

JACK
Like an angel

INT OFFICE

Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who
despite his youth has an irritatingly paternal
attitude toward the two men in his office Jack stays
in the doorway smoking a cigarette as if to venture
any further is to risk contracting some hideous
disease

LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)
(preparing a cash envelope)
Terrific boys Really Terrific

FRANK
Thanks Lloyd

LLOYD
Yes sir Youre just what we needed on a night
like this

FRANK
Uh thanks

Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left
him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone

LLOYD
Only Jack do me a favor will ya pal If you
wanna smoke put on a pair of sunglasses and go
play with the niggers on State Street These
blisters from the midwest dont wanna watch some
guy dripping ash all over himself while hes
playing The Sound of Music

ANGLE - JACK

Smoke curls out of Jacks nose He is utterly still
like a pit bull eyeing a steak

BACK TO SCENE

LLOYD

Okay boys that ought to buy you a few more
Frankie Im declaring this

lessons By the way

Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and
business closed busies himself with other matters

FRANK
Uh You dont know when youll be wanting us

LLOYD

FRANK
Uh well you know the way our schedule is I
thought maybe
LLOYD

Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk
JACK

FRANK

JACK

Lloyd looks up Jack is staring right into him
Reluctantly Frank opens the envelope

Its all here

FRANK
(pulling Jack out)
Ill be talking to you Lloyd

Lloyd doesnt answer He just looks at Jack smiling
with amusement

EXT STREET - JACK AND FRANK

Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
soup bone dogged by Frank whos got the cardboard
stand-up under his arm

FRANK
You mind telling me what that was about in there
Was that planned
Or were you just bored and decided
to get creative

JACK
Fuck him

FRANK
This isnt the Pine Tree Inn on
Route 81 Jack

JACK
Fuck him

FRANK
(to himself)
Fuck him Great Terrific Fuck him

The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
Franks car Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
the stand-up away

JACK
So we on tomorrow night

FRANK
(shaking his head)
Maybe Thursday I hear the harpist at the
Sheratons got appendicitis

Jack nods and starts to walk away
FRANK
(continuing)

Hey

Jack stops
FRANK
(continuing)
Listen why dont you come out to the house

JACK
I hate your kids Frank

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

JACK

She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub

FRANK
She didnt know what she was doing
Youre too sensitive

JACK
You got weird kids Frank

FRANK
Look I just thought if you came out you might
see what youre missing

Jack just stares at Frank
FRANK

(continuing)
Just think about it all right
Consider it a standing offer
Frank closes the trunk and moves to the drivers side

FRANK
(continuinglike a litany)
You want a ride Jack No Frank
Ill walk Okay Jack good night
Good night Frank

Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb
Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance

then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads

for home

ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING

Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
building where a black labrador is studying him from
a second story window

INT JACKS APARTMENT

Jacks apartment is small old and comfortably
cluttered The most striking item is a vintage phone
booth placed against the wall As Jack lets himself in
EDDIE the dog from the window walks over He is not
an overly enthusiastic dog but you can see from his
face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack

JACK
Hi pal Thought you were gonna clean the
apartment

Eddie nuzzles the soup bone Jack unwraps the paper
and hands it over

JACK
(continuing)
Take it easy will ya Youre becoming a regular
Johhny Appleseed the way youre dropping teeth
around here

Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over

to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs

He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
MACHINE As Bill Evans smoky PEACE PIECE fills the
tiny apartment Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
walks over to the old piano near the window Settling
back with the bottle of whiskey Jack rests his elbows
gently on the keys and stares out the open window
listening to the music

INT

Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony

FRANK

JACK

Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process
watching Jack for a verdict
After a moment Jack nods

FRANK

WILLIE

INT DINER

The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner

Jack nursing an ice coffee

Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs

The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
of neighborhood luminaries

including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes

FRANK
You know I think its been five years since I
saw you eat anything Thats the Gods truth

JACK
Trust me youre not missing anything

FRANK
You look awful

JACK
Thanks

FRANK

Really You sleeping

JACK
Only on odd days

FRANK
(a look)
Seeing anyone in particular

JACK
Why the interest

FRANK
Because Im your brother Because I care about
you Because sometimes it seems like the most
significant relationship in your life is with
that goddamn dog of yours

Jack studies his brothers face

JACK
Im not seeing anyone In particular

FRANK
What about that waitress at the Ambassador

JACK
Uh-uh How about you You seeing anyone

FRANK
Funny
(points at his wedding band)
Strike a bell

JACK

Jack smiles and sips his coffee

FRANK
(continuing)
By the way we gotta go see Ma tomorrow

JACK

JACK

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

JACK

JACK

JACK

That mightve meant something in the Apache
clubhouse but it dont cut too deep anymore

FRANK
Christ Jack its her birthday

Jack glances up Frank nods

FRANK

(continuing)

So what do you say
Think the city can spare you for an afternoon

Jack squints out the window

FRANK
(continuing)
Okay And dont worry about a present
I got her something from both of us

EXT STREET

Jack cradling a pink bakery box in one hand
gets out of Franks car and surveys the street
on which he grew up

FRANK
Make sure you lock

ANOTHER ANGLE
Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
three houses down there would not appear to be a wealth
of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity

But its not Jacks car so he doesnt press the point

BACK TO SCENE

FRANK

Place looks good huh I got a neighbor boy to
mow the lawn pick up Five bucks
Timesve changed huh

(pointing)
See the tree
Remember the job Cecil did on it the day
Dad planted it
You can still see the scars on the trunk Really
I was looking at it just the other day
Jesus I thought he was gonna kill that cat

Frank smiles recalling Cecils near-demise

then raps on the front door

Jack studies the tree a moment

then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Franks hand

JACK
So whatd we get her

FRANK
Youll see

ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

At that moment the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
is there a vibrant woman in her sixties

MRS BAKER
Well if it isnt the fabulous Baker Boys

FRANK
Hows the birthday girl

MRS BAKER
A little stiffer but just as sturdy

Mrs Baker hugs Frank then a bit awkwardly
embraces Jack

MRS BAKER
(continuing)
John Its good to see you
JACK
(uncomfortable balancing cake box)
Good to see you Ma

Jack looks over his mothers shoulder at Frank and
mimics John with a knowing nod

FRANK
Uh Ma you know no one calls him that anymore
Jack He goes by Jack

MRS BAKER
I thought maybe held gotten over that

FRANK
Twenty years Ma

MRS BAKER
Yes yes Its just that John is so much nicer
Jack sounds so crude When I was a little girl

we had a pig on the farm named Jack
I guess I just cant help making the association

Jacks eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
holds his brother personally responsible for this

FRANK
Uh yeah well you know Ma
John Kennedy went by Jack

MRS BAKER
Catholics What do you expect
Oh well whats in a name right
Lets go inside and have a look at that cake

As Mrs Baker exits Frank leans over to Jack

FRANK
Keep her busy will ya
I have to set a few things up

Frank disappears leaving Jack alone on the porch

with the bakery box Jack shakes his head

wondering how hes going to make it through the afternoon
then enters the house

INT HOUSE

The front room is cluttered with his childhood

Most noticeable are the pianos two tiny uprights
perfectly matched their simulated ivory keys yellowed
with age Above them pressed between glass and framed
are the music ribbons faded by twenty years of sunlight
Finally there is the sheet music dusty and dog-eared
piled everywhere in drunken stacks

This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly
warily but with a noticeable dispassion

until his eyes fall upon a photograph

In it he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man

in baggy slacks safe within the arc of his long arms

Frank is staring straight into the camera neat clean
perfectly posed but Jack a year younger

his shirt too big is caught in profile

looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze

MRS BAKER
(entering)
Well now wheres everyone run off to
Frank

JACK
Downstairs

MRS BAKER
Oh

All at once Jack and his mother realize they are alone

MRS BAKER
Well shall we cut that cake

Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen
He places the box on the table and stands off to the
side while Mrs Baker sets about preparing things

MRS BAKER
So How are you

JACK
Fine You

MRS BAKER
Oh fine

Silence
Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake
Her fingers are trembling

MRS BAKER
(continuing)
Big piece or little

JACK
Huh Oh no

MRS BAKER
None

JACK
Im not much for sweets

Mrs Baker nods

MRS BAKER
Hows that dog of yours What was his name

JACK
Eddie

MRS BAKER
Yes Right Eddie How is he

JACK
Hes losing his teeth

Mrs Baker stops and looks up into Jacks eyes
Suddenly a NOISE is heard in the other room

MRS BAKER
Sounds like your brothers back with us

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
old movie projector and a roll-up screen

MRS BAKER
(entering)
Whats all this

Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
tiny ribboned box

Go on
Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs Baker
pulls the ribbon off the box

Inside is a tiny spool of film

MRS BAKER
Why whats this
INT KITCHEN (LATER)

Blank screen curtains drawn the room dark

Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake
Mrs Baker close on his elbow

sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen
Jack sits off to the side

A title card appears

For Mrs Ellie Baker who made it all possible
Mrs Baker gives Frank a puzzled look

He just smiles

Suddenly images spring to the screen

obviously footage several years old

showing Jack and Frank as children

sitting at the tiny pianos wearing matching suits
smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera

MRS BAKER
Oh my God

FRANK
Recognize these two characters

MRS BAKER
I thought these were lost
Where did you find

FRANK
In the attic Behind some of Dads stuff
(pointing with his fork)
Look Jack can hardly reach the pedals

As Franks laughter fills the dark room

Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen
Suddenly a jagged cut springs the boys a year later
in the same positions smiling the same smiles

MRS BAKER
(laughing)
Oh no

FRANK
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
all together Boy old man Henderson didnt
fool around when he gave a haircut did he Jack

Jack says nothing

MRS BAKER
Oh look at you two So skinny
And those tiny suits

FRANK

Wait Watch Here

comes Dad

Jacks eyes narrow as the film jumps another year

and a man enters the frame

obviously by accident

He is so tall his face cannot be seen
As he dances quickly out of sight

he ruffles Jacks hair

MRS BAKER

That man

As the film jumps again

Jack glances at the photograph to his right
The images on the screen flicker softly off
the glass of the picture frame

MRS
(continuing)
Oh look how youre
My little boys

Jacks eyes drift from the
and brother sitting close
laughing After a moment
looks back to the children

BAKER (0S)

growing

photograph to his mother
together in the love seat
their voices fade and Jack
on the screen

like two tiny men mirror images of one another
At first the changes are subtle

Little Jacks tie is askew

But as the years flick by
another less and less

his shirt missing a button
the brothers resemble one

until finally

the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in

his place is a slouching

tousle-haired adolescent in

rumpled coat and open collar

a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip

A womans hand darts into the frame and plucks the
offending cigarette away in a flash

INT CAR

Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jacks building
Whispers of steam snake from the

mancovers in the street

JACK
I made her nervous

FRANK
What do you mean
JACK
Her hands Like that

Jack holds out a trembling hand

FRANK
Nah Medication

Jack looks over at Frank He nods

FRANK
(continuing)
Couple years now
(taps his heart)
Keeps the beat steady Nothing serious

Jack considers this a moment then gets out of the car

FRANK
She was glad to see you

INT JACKS APARTMENT

Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops

Across the room curled up on the couch is a little girl
Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
the bedroom As he folds a blanket under her chin

he pauses The girls face is calm peaceful

EXT STREET - DAWN

The next morning Early

The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
beginning to drip out onto the street Suddenly
RINGING OUT over the rooftops is JINGLE BELLS

-- not the entire song just the first two bars

over and over

IHT JACKS APARTMENT - DAY

Jack on the couch his arm draped over a slumbering
Eddie opens his eyes Across the room

seated at the piano is NINA the little girl

She stops playing and turns

NINA
Morning You want coffee I made coffee
Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up
He nods to the coffee Nina goes to the kitchen

NINA
(continuing)
I did the dishes last night Youre missing a cup

Jack rubs his head then gets up and walks to the window

NINA
(continuing)
Did you break a cup Jack

JACK
Eddie did

Nina looks at Eddie sleeping on the couch
then brings Jack his coffee with both hands

NINA
I practiced the piano last night Two hours
I think Im ready for Jingle all the way

Jack nods Suddenly the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard
Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling

NINA
(continuing)
Guess theyre up

JACK
Sounds big Whats he do

NINA
Process server
Ma said its like a lawyer only the hours
are more regular All I knows he came to take
the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
dinner And breakfast

JACK
What happened to the donut king

NINA
Married

Upstairs a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
stairwell Nina peers out the window

NINA
No breakfast Maybe they had a fight
TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling

NINA
(continuing)
Well gotta go Teach me later

Jack nods
Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits
Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge

JACK
Hey

INT LUAU LOUNGE

Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses

of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys presence
seem a bit incongruous Jack and Frank hold nothing back
giving McCarthur Park the full treatment
Unfortunately the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldnt
fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause

is less than volcanic

FRANK
Uh thank you That concludes our show for this
evening Jack and I only hope you enjoyed
yourselves as much as we did

As the guests wander out clutching their roomkeys
a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up

BELLHOP
Mr Baker

FRANK
(tired)
Yeah Jimmy

JIMMY (BELLHOP)
Mr Simpson asked to see you

FRANK
All right tell him Ill be right there

As Jimmy exits Frank stands and points at Jack
FRANK

(continuing)
Tomorrow we close with the ‘Aquarius Suite
INT HOTEL CORRIDOR

Frank pauses before a door marked HOTEL MANAGER
Its half-open Inside CHARLIE SIMPSON

a heavy man in a shiny suit

is throwing darts in the general direction of a
dartboard Hes not very good Frank knocks

CHARLIE
Frankie

FRANK
You wanted to see me Charlie

ANOTHER ANGLE

CHARLIE

FRANK

Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it
to Frank

FRANK

(confused)

They dont know class if it walks up and
grabs em by the balls

INT HOTEL LOBBY

Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with
the cardboard stand-up

JACK
Whats with Charlie

FRANK
Nothing Everythings great
Terrific

INT FRANKS HOUSE

With the stand-up under his arm

Frank enters and closes the door quietly

A light is glowing in the kitchen

The rest of the house is dark quiet In the kitchen

he checks the message pad by the phone Nothing

On the table a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him
Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached
Frank Please
Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall
The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard
Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer

Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and
replaces it with a new one

As he presses the photograph in place

his eyes drift to the one of himself

It was taken a long time ago

INT JACKS APARTMENT

Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
piano by the window As the needle hits the spinning
disc a sharp snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout
the apartment Jack takes a drink then joins in with
the record playing along His concentration is intense
so much so that a moment later when the PHONE RINGS

he seems not to hear it Finally he picks it up

JACK
Yeah

FRANK (V0)

JACK
Frank

FRANK (V0)
Yeah Listen come out to the

JACK

FRANK (V0)
Something came up Dont worry
Charlie stayed true Both nights
Ill give you your share tomorrow
At the house

Silence

FRANK (V0)
(continuing)
So youll come out right

JACK
Yeah okay

Jack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark
then the CONNECTION goes DEAD

EXT STREET

A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses
In his rumpled city suit Jack looks like a cheap
gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers

He walks up to the door of a small white house and
presses the doorbell

When there is no response he goes around to the back

EXT BACKYARD

The backyard is small with a short chainlink fence
surrounding it Two kids a girl and a boy

are splashing around in a build-it-yourself
above-ground pool

When they see Jack they stop splashing

Only their heads are visible above the water
JACK
Hey kids Dad home

The two heads say nothing

JACK
(continuing)
What dya say Wanna run and get
him for me

Still nothing Jack frowns takes out a cigarette
and pats his pocket for a match

JACK
(continuing)
Shit

The kids eyes widen at his profanity

Jack the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip

ponders things for a moment

then flicks thecigarette away and steps over the fence
At which point

the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream

JACK
(continuing)
Hey kid Take it easy

No use The kids a world-class screamer
Frank wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed
comes racing out of the house

FRANK
Cindy What is it

Cindy points At Jack

FRANK
(continuing)
Jack

JACK
Your doorbell doesnt work

FRANK
Honey its only Uncle Jack You
remember Uncle Jack

DONNA Franks wife appears

DONNA
Whats the matter Jack
Jack waves

FRANK
(lifting Cindy out of the pool)
Nothings the matter Is it sweetheart

DONNA
Ill take her inside You too
little Frank Out of the pool

Donna shepherds the kids toward the house

FRANK
Feet

The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
and disappear into the house Frank turns to Jack

FRANK
(continuing)
Its probably the excitement of
seeing you again

EXT BACKYARD (LATER)

Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade
The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
aluminum chairs

FRANK
Well look at this

DONNA
You bring trunks Jack

JACK
Trunks

DONNA
Swimming trunks

JACK
Oh No Strictly dryland

DONNA
Too bad You could use some sun
Really

JACK

Maybe next time
DONNA

JACK
Just the same

DONNA
Suit yourself

Donna returns to the house
Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
surroundings complacently

FRANK
Nice huh

JACK

FRANK

The trees The flowers Nice

JACK

Jack glances up Dangerous territory

JACK
A gust of wind killed him

JACK

FRANK

JACK

Silence

JACK

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

Jack laughs coldly

JACK

No one can touch us

FRANK
Two pianos isnt enough anymore
Jack

JACK

It never was

YOUNG WOMAN

in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
center of a tiny room in the back of Willies piano
showroom holding some sheet music Sammy Davis Jrs
face is on the sheet music Frank is sitting against
the opposite wall a notepad in his hand

Jack is at the piano

FRANK
Good morning Miss

YOUNG WOMAN
Moran Monica Moran

FRANK
All right Miss Moran

MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
Actually thats my stage name

FRANK
Im sorry

MONICA
Moran Monica The whole thing
Its my stage name My real names Blanche

FRANK
Blanche

MONICA
No romance right Thats why I came up with
Monica Its what I prefer

FRANK
Well thats fine --

MONICA
But if you call my house and my mother answers
ask for Blanche If you ask for Monica shell
think you have the wrong number and hang up

FRANK
Right

MONICA
And if she asks what its about dont tell her
Shes opposed to my career

FRANK
Uh-huh Well Miss Moran what
is it youd like to do for us

MONICA
Candy Man
(worried)
Is that all right

FRANK
Its one of Jacks favorites

Monica turns and seeing Jack at the piano
gives a little start

MONICA
Oops I almost forgot you were
there Heres the music

Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music

FRANK
Uh he knows it
MONICA
Really Isnt that a coincidence

JACK
Small world
Monica smiles She likes Jack
FRANK

Well shall we

Probably not but Jack begins to play anyway
laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
swings her arms and taps her foot Despite all this
Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
has to scramble over a chord to catch her

sort of like a fireman with a net

MONICA
Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Toss it in the air and
Make a groovy lemon pie
The Candy Man can
The Candy Man can

There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
daughters career

FRANK
Thank you Miss Moran thats enough

Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up
Frank looks over at Jack
Jack shrugs and continues to play

FRANK
(continuing)
Miss Moran Miss Moran

Blanche

Monicas eyes pop open

MONICA
Oh sorry I get so caught up in
it sometimes Its scary

FRANK

Yes it is

MONICA
Well thanks
(to Jack)
Bye

JACK
Drive carefully

As Monica exits Jack and Frank glance at one another
and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
singers who cant sing As Frank sinks lower in his
chair and Jacks ashtray spills over with wounded
cigarettes singer after singer in all shapes sizes
and colors come forth to offer their own unique
interpretations of Feelings I Gotta Be Me

This Is My Song and perhaps most appropriately
What Kind of Fool Am I

Finally when it is all over

Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room
looking dazed exhausted and mildly homicidal

TALL YOUNG WOMAN

As the sequence ends a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
walks into Willies She glances around

then spots Willie across the room

eating a corn beef on rye

WOMAN
Hey You one of the fabulous
Baker Boys

JACK AND FRANK

Frank is staring at his notepad

The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway
holding a shoe in her hand Its broken

SUSIE

FRANK
Thats the premise

Susie gives Frank a dark look then turns to Jack

SUSIE
I Get Along Without You Slowly
okay

Jack nods and begins to play
Frank slouches down in his chair
preparing to be tortured again

SUSIE

(continuing singing)
I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being
Sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well

Susie stops Frank just sits there
Jack just sits there She can sing
SUSIE
(continuing)
So
FRANK
(blinking)

Jack looks over at Frank like hes insane

Yeah well okay Bye Bakers

Susie walks out barefoot

JACK
What are you crazy

FRANK

JACK

That makes her the only one in the class

FRANK
I dont know She had gum on her lip
for Christ sake
I dont think shes right for the act

JACK
(studying him)
Youre getting cold feet about

FRANK
I was just thinking what Ma would

JACK

Ma Ma Was Ma there the last time we played the
Ambassador Oh thats right she was on bass

Frank frowns and looks down at his hands

JACK
(continuing)
How many other silent partners are there Frank
Donna Little Cindy

FRANK
Okay okay Ill call the girl

Frank gets up wearily then glances down at the notepad

JACK
Whats the matter
FRANK
I didnt get her number
EXT STREET

Jack and Frank dash out of Willies and glance up
and down the street Nothing

FRANK
We can always look her up in the
book
JACK

Jack shakes his head in disgust

WOMAN (0S)

ANOTHER ANGLE
Jack and Frank whirl around
There standing in the doorway is Susie
SUSIE

Intuition
CITY SKYLINE
Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day
Once again JINGLE BELLS is heard

JACK FRANK AND SUSIE

Ensconsed in the back room of Willies preparing
for their first rehearsal

FRANK
Ready

Jack nods
(continuing)
Ready

Susie nods Frank poises his hands over the piano
hesitates then looks at Jack again

FRANK
(continuing)
Ready

Jack squints at Frank then nods
Frank turns to Susie

FRANK
(continuing)
Ready

SUSIE
(looking around)
What are we an orchestra all of
a sudden

Frank glares at her

SUSIE
(continuing)
Sorry

Frank poises his hands over the piano again and
begins to play the opening passage of

Just the Way You Are A moment later Jack joins in
and a moment after that Susie Unfortunately

Jack and Frank accustomed to playing alone

are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
fifth grade recital

After a few bars Susie holds up her hand

SUSIE
Fellas fellas

Jack and Frank stop

FRANK
Whats the problem

SUSIE
The problem is I cant hear myself
sing with all this
(searching)
music You know what Im saying
Jack and Frank look at one another

SUSIE
(continuing)
I mean back there it may be hard to notice
but up here Im having a little trouble
getting a word in

Jack and Frank just stare

SUSIE
(continuing)
I mean youre supposed to be
backing me up right

FRANK
(icily)
No We are not supposed to be
backing you up

SUSIE
What I mean is --

FRANK

Frank stares at Susie for a long moment

FRANK
I suppose we can bring it down a
little

JACK

FRANK
Okay

Susie looks at the two brothers
SUSIE
Okay
WILLIES SHOWROOM - LATER

Frank is on Willies telephone
In the front of the store just out of earshot
Jack sits at a beat-up grand
while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another

FRANK
Im telling you Ray Shes got
a voice like an angel What

Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie
making a very sexy silhouette against the front window
is running her hand over a pearl-white piano

FRANK
(continuing)

No I wouldnt say shes got a
body like an angel

As Frank continues to talk in the background
Susie looks over at Jack

SUSIE
Hey hes not sore is he

JACK
Hell come around

Susie nods goes back to stroking the piano

JACK
(continuing)
You never sang before

SUSIE
Not for money With my mother

Jack nods slowly but Susie sees he doesnt understand

SUSIE

(continuing)
She used to waitress downtown nights

You know how people whistle when theyre nervous
My mother sang She always said youre never alone
with a song cause thousands of people know the
same song and even though you cant hear em

If they were they were all singing safe inside
their apartments

(shrugging)
But it worked We always got home Ever since

Jack looks down at the piano in front of him

JACK
Yeah We took a lot of lessons

JACK AND NINA

Jacks tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
ready for the nights gig Nina standing next to him
at the sink watches as he works up a lather on a bar
of shaving soap then paints his face with the suds

NINA
You shave like an old movie Jack

As Jack picks up a razor Nina takes the brush and begins
to soap her face in the mirror

JACK
In the old days every man had a shaving mug that
he kept at the barber shop Then whenever he
wanted a shave held go down to the barber shop
and there would be his mug waiting for him

NINA
Is that what you used to do

JACK
My days are not the old days

NINA

JACK
The recent past

JACK

Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush

JACK

INT HOTEL

As Jack enters the hotel he passes by the cardboard
stand-up prominently displayed in the lobby

It is virtually unchanged except for a small notation
at the bottom With Guest Vocalist

On the other side of the lobby

Frank is pacing nervously

FRANK
Where the hell is she

feint an opponent

Jack hits him

downtown department store the brothers turning a few
heads with their tuxedoes As they reach the ladies

The switch Hit the switch

SUSIE
Switch

INT LOBBY

A BELLBOY exits the elevator and hearing Susies voice
coming from the lounge stops
He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk

BELLBOY

CLERK

BELLBOY

Well whos that
The Clerk looks up from the register and listens

CLERK
I dont know Frank

INT LOUNGE

Judging from the faces Susies as big a hit in the
lounge as she is in the lobby Head thrown back eyes
closed she sings with abandon finishing on a long
extended note then swooping down in a dramatic
exhausted bow There is a split second of silence
then thunderous applause Magic

The new trio fresh off their first gig

Frank puts the money in his pocket Susie stares at
him steaming

SUSIE

Then I want my name on the poster

Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot
Jack is leaning against the wall
watching it all with amusement

JACK
Nice girl

ON Franks expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
New York New York and we see

SERIES OF SHOTS

Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
another playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences

newly done over with a picture of Susie and an
accompanying exclamation See the Sensational Susie

INT LLOYDS OFFICE

Jack and Frank once again in the office of the
supercilious Lloyd waiting as he prepares their
cash envelope

onto She a local

FRANK
Born and bred

LLOYD

Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave

LLOYD

Frank glances at Jack giving it to him
Jacks eyes go cold

JACK
Well call you

As Lloyds face drops Jack and Frank step into the
hallway and begin to walk slowly away playing it cool
then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
because theyre about to burst out laughing

FOLLOWING SHOT

By the time they reach the lobby they are laughing
tripping across the carpet out the front entrance and
onto the sidewalk where their voices explode in the
night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
together laughing giddily until they see - standing
under an awning lighting a cigarette - Susie watching
them with raised eyebrows Jack and Frank frozen ina
clumsy embrace quickly disengage and begin clearing
their throats and squaring their cuffs Susie exhales
a plume of smoke studies them a moment

then smiles slightly

SUSIE
Night Bakers

As she turns away Jack glances up watching her
trim shadow disappear down the street

EXT CITY

Gray and cold The streets swept with rain
And once again the tentative piano

JINGLE BELLS jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride

Oh what fun it is to ride Oh what fun

INT VETERINARY CLINIC

Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room
small and dirty and packed with pet owners and
their animals

Baker Jack Baker

WOMAN

The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room
There is an examining table a sink and on the wall

a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats
Jack glances around the room then comes back to Eddie
whos staring up at him

JACK
You shoulda brushed pal

Just then a MAN in a white coat breezes in

DR BEASLEY (MAN)

Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone
He glances back at the vets with second thought
then moves slowly off

INT JACKS APARTMENT

Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the
refrigerator A carton of cream a few eggs --

theres not much there He takes a small container of
cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an
empty shelf As he closes the refrigerator door he
glances around the apartment It is very still very
quiet He looks up at the ceiling absently then walks
over to the window and looks out There is a mug of
coffee there on the sill He takes it and holds it in
both hands for a moment then places it back on the sill
He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over
the ivory not making a sound then places his hands on
the keys and begins to play Jingle Bells

The Kid disappears into the back Jack stands frozen
watching the swinging door come to rest He looks
like a man who unexpectedly finds a razor pressed
to his neck He fumbles for a cigarette but doesnt
light it He waits A moment later the door swings
open

KID

Jack nods then moving stiffly leaves

EXT VETERINARY CLINIC

Outside he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle

INT JACKS APARTMENT

On the floor a long line of bowls each containing

a different concoction all intended for the ailing Eddie

CITY

draped in winter Dark skies people lost in heavy

tenuously across traffic-clogged streets Over it all

the crowd applauds

of seeing Santa Claus exit a mens room

WOMAN

a wave and exits

FRANK

EXT HOTEL - DAY
Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the

hotel watching the waves tumble into one another
As he starts to take out a cigarette he notices
Florence Simmons standing a few yards away
with a camera

FLORENCE SIMMONS
I just know my sister wont believe
me Do you mind

Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
camera

FLORENCE SIMMONS
I really hate to impose Its just that the
resemblance is so extraordinary
(focusing)
I wonder if you could turn this way so your face
isnt in the shadows

As Jack turns he glances over Florences swaying
shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
end of the walkway They are leaning into the wind
her hair blowing free brushing the mans face

FLORENCE SIMMONS
Say cheese

The camera clicks

FLORENCE SIMMONS
(continuing)
Gotcha Would you like a copy for
yourself The hotel develops

Jack glances away from Susie and the man

JACK
No

ON Jacks expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
later we --

Cut TO

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

That evening The trio has just finished a song and
those on the dance floor are clapping

FRANK
Thank you You know before we came out here
this evening Susie and Jack and I were looking
over your dedications and something struck us
Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea
what hes talking about

FRANK

(continuing)
We realized that well were really not so
different from one another after all Oh sure
we may be at different points in our journey
but we all travel pretty much the same road
And so with that in mind wed like to introduce
you to two very special couples First married
for all of two days please say hello to Helen
and Bud Wilson Helen Bud

Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the
front of the room

FRANK

(continuing)
And now our second couple Im talking about
Ethel and Bert Lane ladies and gentlemen Now
Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told
you theyd been married for fifty years Why
Because ladies and gentlemen Ethel and Bert Lane
have been married for seventy-five years

The audience lets go with an audible ooh
and applauds enthusiastically

FRANK
(continuing)
Ethel Bert Get up here and
show these kids how its done

A path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
their way to the dance floor

FRANK
(continuing)
Arent they a sight

They are indeed and a sight slower getting to the
dance floor than Frank anticipated

He nods to Jack and they launch into The Anniversary
Waltz but have to keep repeating the opening passage
while they wait for Ethel and Bert Finally everyone
on the dance floor steps back and with some help from
a few waiters who slide a section of tables out of the
way Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center
of the room slowly but wonderfully while the younger
couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite

INT BATHROOM

Jack is sitting in the bathroom again smoking He
hears Susies door open then VOICES -- hers anda
mans He puts out his cigarette in the

sink and leaves

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The next morning Frank the early bird is

returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm
Whistling happily he rounds the corner just in time to
see a man exit Susies room Astonished then outraged
he goes to Susies door and knocks sharply

SUSIE
(opening door)
Forget your tie handsome
Frank

FRANK
You want to tell me what the
hells going on

SUSIE
Huh

FRANK
I just saw a man walk out of
your room

SUSIE
Uh

FRANK
In case youve forgotten were being paid to be
here So it might be nice if you conducted
yourself with a certain amount of decency

SUSIE
Decency Hey listen pal

FRANK
No You listen I had my doubts
about you from the beginning

JACK
Hey
Frank and Susie turn Jack is standing in the hallway

JACK
(continuing)
Whatre you trying to do Wake

FRANK
We were just having a little
discussion about morality

SUSIE
Some discussion

FRANK
I just saw a man walk out of your
room

JACK

You saw wrong

FRANK
Huh

JACK

FRANK

JACK
We had a leak in the bathroom

FRANK

JACK
He had to come quickly It was
a big leak

FRANK

JACK
Youre a heavy sleeper Frank
Youve always-been a heavy sleeper
(looking at Susie)
Unlike me
Frank looks at Jack then Susie

FRANK

SUSIE
Forget it

The three stand there awkwardly for a moment

FRANK
Well

Frank shrugs lamely and exits

SUSIE
Boy he comes on like a hurricane
in the morning doesnt he

Jack just stares at her

SUSIE
(continuing)
Yeah well thanks for sticking
your head in

JACK
Hey business is business

He turns to leave Susies eyes narrow
SUSIE
It wasnt business It was pleasure
JACK

Just dinner and dance right

INT DINING ROOM

Jack Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the
smaller dining room It is conspicuously quiet
The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
ignore each other Finally Susie looks at Frank
Then Jack Then out the window

SUSIE
Paradise

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Jack and Franks room It is New Years Eve
just before show time and Jack and Frank are in
their tuxes Frank is on the phone

minutes Yeah Happy New Year I love you

Frank sets the phone down and stares at it
Jack studies him a moment then Frank suddenly
claps his hands

FRANK
(continuing)
Well lets go The public waits

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A mass of swarming jubilant people The voices are
high and loud and theres not a hand without a
champagne glass Couples lean into one another
intimately dancing gaily between the tables toasting
strangers without hesitation

FRANK
(yelling to be heard)
All right everyone This is it
Lets hear it Ten Nine

Gradually the entire room joins the chant

FRANKEVERYONE
Eight Seven Six Five
Four Three Two ONE
HAPPY NEW YEAR

There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
find that certain someone to kiss in the new year

In this moment Jack Frank and Susie find themselves
oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them

their presence suddenly unnecessary forgotten
Finally Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss
then goes to Jack They hesitate then kiss lightly
pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each others
eyes Frank sounds the first chord of Auld Lang Syne
and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place
on the stage As she begins to sing the others in the
room all intimate friends for one brief moment

begin to sing with her

SUSIEEVERYONE
Lest old acquaintances be forgot

As the voices slowly fade they are joined by the
sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear
and we see

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jack lying on his bed in the dark He opens his eyes
squinting against the light from the bathroom then
glances over to Franks bed and detects the outline

of a body in the darkness Swinging his legs over the
side he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes
Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
the next bed shifts falling into the shaft of light cast
from the bathroom It is a little boy Startled Jack
stares at the sleeping boy then hears movement in the
bathroom Rising slowly he walks to the bathroom and
gently eases the door open a few inches Inside swimming
murkily in the steamy mirror is the reflection of a man
His back is to Jack but Jack can see that the man is
shaving As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor he sees
that water is dripping off the mans pant cuffs and
gathering in pools on the bathroom floor Jack wakes
up He stares at the ceiling listening to the waves
then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom It is
dark Turning he glances at Franks bed Its empty

INT DINING ROOM

Dark and soundless Balloons streamers and the other
debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow
Frank is sitting at the window drinking as he stares at

the ocean As Jack crosses the room he looks up

FRANK
Ah well if it isnt the lad with the golden ear
Happy New Year little brother

JACK
Whatre you doing down here

FRANK
Celebrating Join me

JACK
The partys over

FRANK
No youre wrong Its just beginning
Come on have a drink

Frank pours hima glass Jack notices the bottle

JACK
Expensive hangover

FRANK

A gift Courtesy of our courteous
hotel manager Mr Daniels

(toasting Jack)
We dear brother are a fucking
smash

(nodding)
Yup They want us back Easter It seems they
have this egg hunt every year Only not for kids
Adults They stuff these plastic eggs with
Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais
and everyone has a grand time crawling around on
the front lawn Then afterwards they have a
dance An egg dance Everyone comes dressed in
a different colored shell and at the end of the
evening they crack themselves open Its our job
to separate the yolks from the whites
Slippery business

Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink then
leans his head back staring at the ceiling

FRANK
(continuing)
You know Ive never kissed my wife on New Years
Not once in twelve years
Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling

FRANK
The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesnt it
With the blue glass

Jack looks up at the chandelier

JACK
The Royal

FRANK
Right The Royal Whens the
last time we were there

JACK
Couple years

FRANK

JACK

FRANK

Right Its incredible how you

JACK
A useless talent

FRANK
Drove me crazy when we were kids
The way you never looked at the music
Miss Simpson would just play it and

Frank snaps his fingers

JACK
They were simple songs

FRANK
Not for me I still have to look at the music
sometimes you know that Otherwise I forget
I just forget But you You never forget
Ever
(turning)
So how come you couldnt remember Mas birthday

JACK
I told you Its a useless talent
Frank studies Jack a moment then stares out at the
ocean

FRANK
God the old man wouldve loved
this view wouldnt he

JACK
Yeah

FRANK
I always think of him on New Years
How he used to pour us each half a can of beer
Remember

JACK
You always threw up

FRANK
Yeah and you drank yours like it was orange juice
He loved that about you

JACK
He was just having fun

FRANK
It was like youd passed some test
you know

JACK
It was just a can of beer Frank

FRANK
Yeah but he told you things He never told me
anything Even though I was the oldest
It was always you two running off doing things
together

JACK
You couldve come

FRANK
I couldve But he didnt want
me to

JACK

Youre making things up Frank

FRANK
Maybe so
(pause)
You ever go back there Where it
happened

Jack stares at the angry SEA LOUD even through the
thick glass

JACK
No

EXT HOTEL - DAY

The next morning Jack is sitting outside the hotel
watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado

The streamers by now turned to mush cling like oatmeal
to the cars exterior After a moment Frank exits with
a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a

tiny souvenir shot glass

FRANK
Want one

Jack shakes his head

FRANK
(continuing)
Ah well the kidsll break a
couple anyway

Suddenly across the parking lot the voices of the
newlyweds are heard

BUD
Give me the keys

HELEN
Youre not going to drive

BUD
Give me the keys

HELEN
Youre not going to drive

BUD
Its my goddamn car

HELEN
Its our goddamn car

BUD
Give me the keys
HELEN
No

Bud hesitates then makes a rush for his wife but
shes too quick and runs to the other side of the car
Frustrated he begins to run around the car like a
madman trying to catch her Finally when he gets
close she darts off sprinting across the parking lot

FRANK
I think Ill warm up the car

OVERVIEW - CITY

Cold dark dangerous but somehow looking quite
appealing after a week in paradise

INT CAR - NIGHT

The trio looking road-weary is parked in front
of Jacks building It is very late

Jack gets out of the car Frank shakes his head in
exasperation then looks to Susie

FRANK
How about you Got a Bar Mitzvah

SUSIE
(distracted)
Huh
FRANK
Forget it

INT JACKS APARTMENT

Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly
In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie
curled up on the couch asleep Above them

hung carefully on a string are some paper letters
WELCOME HOME

INT LOUNGE

In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
several historical eras but which might best be described
as Modern Pilgrim Jack Susie and Frank perform
Feelings while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass
in and out of view

SUSIE
Feelings Wo wo wo Feelings
Wo wo wo Feelings

KITCHEN
Jack Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause

SUSIE

Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself
SUSIE

(continuing)

EXT HOTEL

A few minutes later Jack comes out of the hotel and

sees Susie pacing
He sits down and watches her for a moment

JACK
Youre gonna wear down those
heels if you dont give it a rest

She stops

JACK
(continuing)
Relax Well drop the song

SUSIE

JACK
Its a shitty song

Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel

SUSIE
How do you do it Every night
JACK

Not many but a few

Susie nods Jack studies her Somethings on her
mind

SUSIE
Listen
(looks into his eyes)
Nothing

INT JACKS APARTMENT - DUSK

A record is spinning on Jacks phonograph as the sun
goes down outside his window As we MOVE AWAY FROM

the phonograph and PAST the window we FIND Jack at

the piano playing along with the record

lost in concentration

EXT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Susie is working on a Paris Opal pacing occasionally
glancing up at Jacks apartment where the MUSIC can be
heard FAINTLY After a moment she drops her cigarette
on the sidewalk There are half a dozen others

already there

INT JACKS APARTMENT

The record finishes but the needle doesnt pick up
bumping into the label Jack glances at the clock next
to him and gets up He puts on a jacket then takes a
pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully

EXT BUILDING

As Jack comes out of his building Susie stops pacing
surprised Jack wearing the same look of concentration
he had at the piano doesnt see her and turns down the
other end of the street Susie starts to call after
him but stops

EXT JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky
We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club

INT CLUB - NIGHT

Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage where

a trio is playing He has a drink in front of him

but it is untouched After a moment the trio finishes
and the pianist a huge black man named HENRY nods to
the applause

HENRY
Thank you As most of you know we like to shake
things up here every so often just to keep you
people on your toes So Im gonna take a little
rest grab myself a drink and let an old friend sit
in He drops by about once a year just to keep
his hands clean Ladies and gentlemen
Jack Baker

Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henrys hand

As he settles behind the piano he sits for a moment

not moving then nods to the two men behind him As they
begin to play we recognize the music from the record
Jack waits then brings his hands to the keys As he
plays his face is suddenly calm Peaceful

EXT CLUB - NIGHT

Later Jack comes out of the club and into the night
lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street

SUSIE (0S)

Jack stops Susie

JACK

SUSIE

Jacks face goes a little cold but he says nothing
beginning to walk again

SUSIE

SUSIE

JACK

SUSIE

Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at
Susie Jack moves to the kitchen

JACK

Okay
SUSIE
(a look)
Sure

INT JACKS APARTMENT - LATER

Light from a weak lamp lots of shadows as romantic
as Jacks apartment will ever get Outside the window
the city looks like a thousand jewels gleaming

Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
about the room slipping in and out of the shadows as
if they were veils

SUSIE
(at window)
Like diamonds huh I never get over it
When I was a little girl my mamad stand me before
the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a
wishLike I could reach out and grab all the lights
of the city and string them into-a necklace for

myself Shed take my hand and when she closed her

eyes I dont know it was like she really
believed it

JACK
How come you didnt close your eyes

She looks surprised by the question

SUSIE
I dont know I guess I didnt
trust the night like she did

Susie finishes her drink and sets it down

SUSIE
(continuing)
Let me have a cigarette will you
All of mine are down there on the sidewalk

Jack looks at her curiously

SUSIE
(continuing)
Long story

Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it

SUSIE
(continuing)
You know I saw you guys once
You and Frank At the Roosevelt

JACK
Mustve been a cheap date

SUSIE
Soap convention

JACK

SUSIE

Yeah they got a convention for everything At
least he was clean Boy the guys I met when I

was with the service you wouldnt believe

older ones they were okay Nice Polite

the chair out for you But the younger ones
(shaking her head)
Mama used to say dance with a man once but if you
can feel calluses on his fingers dont dance with
him again She thought she had it all figured out
But she wasnt so smart There are killers with
palms like a baby

Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly

SUSIE

(continuing)
It wasnt so bad though Id get a nice piece of
steak flowers sometimes even a gift Usually
whatever the guy was into Got a socket set once
Believe it The guy looked like held just given me
four dozen roses

(almost wistful)
But I stayed at the Hartford once You should see
the rooms All satin and velvet And the bed
Royal blue trimmed in lace clean as snow Hard to
believe sleeping in a room like that dont change
your life But it dont The bed may be magic but
the mirror isnt You wake up the same old Susie

(pause)
I didnt always you know If I liked the guy

Susie looks at Jack but he just takes a drink She
looks out the window again

SUSIE
(continuing)
Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up

She stares at the lights another moment then turns and
nods to the phone booth

SUSIE
(continuing)

So whats this

Jack frowns takes another drink

JACK

Theyd been out dancing all night and he took

SUSIE

JACK
By the time he gets to the corner newstand hes

So what happened

JACK
He calls her asks her to marry him she thinks

JACK
(continuing)

SUSIE

JACK
Ma didnt want it around After

SUSIE

Jack glances out the window
SUSIE
(continuing carefully)

Frank said you saw him die

Jack glances up quickly surprised He nods

SUSIE
(continuing)

Frank said ---

Frank wasnt there

Susie stops looks down Jack studies her for a moment
then decides

JACK

He took me out to the docks one day We did that a
lot There were other places but he loved the ocean
Hed worked boats as a kid Never got rid of it
It was always in him Hed drink a little when wed
go If he drank enough hed do this funny Irish jig
To make me laugh

(pause)
He drank a lot that day

Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass

JACK
(continuing)
There was a lot of wind He was up on this cargo
shelf right over the ocean And he started to
do the jig One minute he was there
(shrugs)

I thought it was a joke at first

He did things like that Games
(pause)

I was laughing when it happened

Jack stares at the glass in his hands then glances
up and catches Susie looking at him

JACK

Frank laughs and his voice eerily magnified by the
microphone is the only sound in the room

FRANK
(continuing hanging tough)
Yeah well anyway Its nice to be back here in

Frank falters as he sees Mrs Baker enter the lounge and
seat herself at a table in the back of the room

watch him go then turn to each other Mrs Baker smiles
awkwardly then surveys the lobby

MRS BAKER
(continuing)
Its beautiful isnt it

The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -
once covered with velvet now with a cheap imitation -
look old and dowdy but the room still maintains an
elegant dignity

JACK
Yeah

MRS BAKER
This was quitea place once After the war On
Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom
upstairs It was beautiful Crystal chandeliers
White tablecloths Orchids floating in the punch
bowls It was a wonderful place to be young

Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room
After a moment she nods toward the lounge

MRS BAKER
(continuing)

Mrs Baker glances into the lounge at the two pianos

MRS BAKER

Funny Watching tonight I was

How I used to stand in the kitchen listening to
the two of you practice while I did the dishes

Jack looks puzzled Suddenly his mother reaches out
and very gently touches her fingers to his face

MRS BAKER
(continuing)
You look so like him

They stand like this for a moment connnected then
Frank steps in from the street

FRANK

MRS BAKER

Mrs Baker takes her hand from Jacks face and turns
away Just before she exits she looks back

MRS BAKER
(continuing)
Good night Jack

EXT STREET

Jack walking home turns a corner and suddenly stops
Across the street talking to a man is Susie She says
a few words to the man then touches him lightly on the
arm and begins to walk away Jack watches her retreat
then follows moving quicker as he draws close As he
reaches her he gently touches her elbow and she turns
Not Susie The woman stares at Jack startled

For a moment he doesnt move Finally he lets go of
her elbow

JACK
Sorry

INT HALLWAY

Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway

the corridor As Jack and Frank turn they see a huge
YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them

YOUTH

Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it
around the corner

FRANK

and crepe paper operation Along one wall is the phone
bank monitored by a few sleepy volunteers and opposite
in makeshift bleachers is the audience A huge tote board
set on rolling astors is next to the phones The total

at 215 AM is 112538 As Jack and Frank enter the kid
in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the
camera

FRANK

Frank leaves Jack glances around the studio like hes
walked into a nightmare At the phone bank a heavyset
MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap looks over Both the
sweatshirt and the cap have Earl printed on them

The audience applauds Jack glares at Frank He shrugs
VINCE

(continuing)
Well all right then What are we

Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and
begin to play As the music rises the studio becomes
very quiet almost still Unfortunately Jack and Frank
are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously
LOUD BELL begins to RING Suddenly Vince steps out
again

VINCE
(continuing)
Uh oh We know what that means dont we Its
time to turn the board over
(to Jack Frank)
Im afraid you fellasll just have to wait a minute
Lets bring out the board

Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board
right in front of Jack and Frank
Jack looks positively homicidal

FRANK
Jack

Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave
Then seeing the kid in the wheelchair he grabs the
basketball and fires it at Vince

VINCE

starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door

FRANK

Earl shoves Jack into the hallway hard
Jack stumbles back against the wall

Jack flings Frank against the wall pounding pulling
and slamming him in a fitful rage

FRANK
(continuing scared)
Jack Jack

Frank slides to the ground afraid trying to protect
himself Jack hovers over him

JACK

Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Franks face
Frank holds up his hands trying to shield himself
and catches a blow on his fingers
FRANK

Jack grabs one of Franks hands

JACK
(mocking)
Your hands Your hands couldnt take the blue
ribbon on amateur night

Jack bends back Franks fingers

FRANK
(terrified)
Jack

JACK

Jack pushes Franks fingers until the knuckles crack

FRANK
Jack JACK

Franks voice echoes high above the sound of the rain
Suddenly Jack stops Looking at Franks hand still
clasped in his he seems as shocked by his own behavior

as Frank Letting go he steps back awkwardly and looks
at his brother beaten to the ground his tuxedo ripped
and dirty He stares at his own hands the knuckles split
and bleeding He no longer looks dangerous He looks
hollow frightened

JACK
Im through with it I cant do
it anymore

Frank rubbing his fingers glances up at Jack but Jack
just turns away leaving Frank on the sidewalk and
disappears into the rain MUSIC begins A sad plaintive
solo piano And we see

SERIES OF SHOTS

Jack crossing the street to his apartment the rain
over now

Frank driving home his face swollen and bruised in the
dim glow of the streetlights
Jack letting himself into his apartment and standing
there Alone

Frank easing the car into the driveway turning off
the engine

Jack taking a bottle from the kitchen moving numbly

Frank much later still sitting in the driveway as
the sun begins to come up

Jack sitting in the phone booth the bottle in his hand

INT JACKS APARTMENT - DAY

The next morning Jack is sitting on the windowsill
watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS He glances at the phone
across the room takes another look at the rain then goes
to the phone He picks it up hesitantly then dials

It rings Again Again

CINDY (V0)

Jack blinks Its Cindy

CINDY
Hello Hellooooo
(fainter)
Daddy Daddy Someones on the
phone and they wont talk

Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle

INT BAR

Jack stands in a dark bar It is early morning and the
light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere
A big beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
talking to Jack

MAN
If they wanna talk about their wife you listen
If they wanna talk about their job you listen
If they wanna talk about their parakeet you listen
Thats it six nights a week nine to one or until I

The MUSIC RETURNS sad and plaintive and we see

INT FRANKS HOUSE

and sister tandem who would be better served by an
obedience school While the little girl pounds
incessantly on the piano her brother runs circles
around the room destroying everything in sight

MUSIC CONTINUES and we see

where Jack and Franks pictures are still displayed

MUSIC CONTINUES and we see

INT BAR

Jack in the bar playing the music weve been hearing
throughout the previous scenes It is after midnight
and the tables are empty Only a few somber men remain
at the bar They do not appear to be music lovers

As Jack finishes he takes a cloth and wipes the keys
There is a glass on the piano with money in it

wake then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle

Susie smiles slightly

SUSIE

EXT STREET

Jack is standing across the street from his mothers
house just looking After a moment he crosses the
street As he moves up the drive he takes notice of
the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it
kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
cats claws -- running vertically up the tree the
damage smoothed and widened by time He runs his
fingers over the imperfection then stands and walks
toward the house

EXT HOUSE

Through the screen door Jack can hear a CLICKING

sound and see partially into the front door Half

the room is cast in shadow the other in blinding light
He opens the door and enters

INT HOUSE

Inside the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING the tail of a
completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage
Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely
into shadow For a moment the house is silent full of
ghosts then gradually a NOISE is heard coming from the
kitchen

INT KITCHEN

As Jack comes into the kitchen he finds Frank searching
through a cabinet He watches for a moment

JACK
Whatre you looking for

Frank turns quickly surprised

FRANK
I didnt hear you come in

JACK
Whatre you doing

FRANK
Oh I was just hoping for something to drink But

cooking sherry

Jack nods Frank looks nervous

Jack glances around the room Pictures on the walls
Handmade curtains lightly faded

FRANK
Its funny Before whenever I came here the
house seemed small But today I cant keep

up with it I keep losing my wind

Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a
moment

FRANK

(continuingglancing away)
God I could use a drink

Jack hesitates then pulls a bottle out of his coat

FRANK
(continuing)
Oh Well great Ill get a couple glasses
Frank moves to a cabinet but theres nothing there

FRANK
(continuing)

Jack holds out the bottle

Frank looks embarrassed

FRANK
(remembering)

Oh hey I want to show you

Jack follows Frank back into the front room Frank
stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
gestures Jack to the other

FRANK
(continuing)
Hit the C Go ahead

Jack steps over to the other piano and taps then Frank
does the same Jack glances up in surprise

FRANK
(continuing)
Im right arent I Theyre
in tune
Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement

FRANK
(continuing)
All these years She kept them in tune
Can you imagine
Now why would she do something like that

Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades
Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
glasses on top of the piano each bearing the name of a
different hotel

FRANK

(continuing)
Hey what do you know Looks like we can have
that drink after all

(picking up a few glasses)
Whats your pleasure We got the downtown Ramada
We got the Travelodge on Route 41
And the Mallory

JACK
Ill take the Mallory

FRANK
Good choice

Frank blows some dust off the glasses

FRANK
(continuing)
Looks like these got a few years on them

JACK
This1ll kill ‘em

Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano
benches As Frank swallows he winces

FRANK
Jesus

It suddenly grows silent each sitting in his old
familiar place staring into his glass

JACK
Howre your hands

FRANK
(surprised)
Oh Fine It was nothing Couple
sore knuckles Nothing

JACK
You know that night I It

FRANK
I told Halloran we didnt do

JACK AND FRANK
(in unison)
What my Sissy-wants my Sissy gets

JACK
She got it all right

Jack and Frank glance at one another little boy
mischief glowing in their faces Suddenly they swivel
on the pianos and begin to play Youre Sixteen

JACK AND FRANK

(singing)
She comes on like a dream
Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
Shes sixteen shes beautiful and shes mine
Ribbons and curls
Ooh what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
Youre sixteen youre beautiful and youre mine

As Jack and Frank finish theyre laughing After a
moment their voices die and the house is quiet again
Full of ghosts Each stares at the tiny keyboard before
him awkward with the intimacy of the moment It is
quiet for a very long time Finally Frank looks over

FRANK
Well One more time

Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass
held out He hesitates then picks up the bottle

JACK
One more time
