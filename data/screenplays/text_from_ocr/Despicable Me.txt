The rollercoaster goes through several loops and corkscrews

in a row The girls are loving it Gru is getting whipped
around mercilessly

EXT SUPER SILLY FUN LAND - DAY

Several hours of rollercoaster riding later the girls and a

Suddenly Agnes sees something off-screen and points

AGNES (0S)
Oh my gosh look at that fluffy
unicorn

A FLUFFY UNICORN is the main prize at the shooting gallery

AGNES
He’s so fluffy I’m gonna die

MARGO
You gotta let us play for it

Gru sighs and addresses the slimy VENDOR

GRU
How much for the fluffy unicorn

VENDOR
(chuckles )
Wellit is not for sale But all
you gotta do to win it is knock
down that little spaceship there

The vendor points to the smallest of the spaceship targets

VENDOR
It’s easy

Gru nods He slaps a dollar bill on the table The vendor
slurps on his drink and presses a button that opens the
curtains and readies the cork guns

AGNES
Yay

They take aim and open fire POP POP POP They all
miss

AGNES
Again

MARGO
Wait

EDITH

Ah come on One more time
AGNES
Just one more I accidentally
closed my eyes
Gru slaps down another bill
POP POP POP This time Agnes’s cork hits the target
AGNES

that I hit it

The video sign above the game reads “YOU LOSE” Gru reacts
EDITH
Awww
GRU

Whoa whoa whoaWhat was that
She hit that I saw that with my
own eyes

The Vendor gives Gru a smarmy smile He flips through a
stack of dollar bills

VENDOR
Hey buddy Let me explain
something to you

The vendor points to the back of the range

VENDOR
Ya see that little tin spaceship
You see how it’s not knocked over
Do you know what that means
professor

The vendor leans over the counter and gets right in Gru’s
face

VENDOR
It means you DON’T GET THE UNICORN
Someone’s got a frowny face
Better luck next time

Gru stares at the vendor his blood beginning to boil He
remains calm and smiles at the vendor

GRU
Okay my turn

Gru calmly reaches into his coat and pulls out a small gun
that transforms into an enormous RAY GUN

BLAM A bright blue RAY BLAST connects with the back of the
shooting range leaving no sign of the targets just a giant
gaping hole Gru turns to the vendor

GRU
Knocked over

The vendor trembles silenced Gru pockets his weapon and
grabs the unicorn He hands it to Agnes Margo and Edith
cheer and Agnes hugs the animal tightly

AGNES
IT’S SO FLUFFY

MARGO
That was awesome

EDITH
You blew up the whole thing

And then it happens actually connecting with the girls and
enjoying being with them Gru allows a small smile to creep
across his face

feeling horrible Then he feels a tug on his jacket Gru
looks down and sees Margo Edith and Agnes He frowns

the middle of a pep talk

Agnes produces a PIGGY BANK Gru stares at it

He takes the piggy bank shakes it and it rattles He opens
it and several coins fall out onto his hand He stares at
them Then looks at the girls Feeling things he’s probably
never felt before

possessions wallets mounted fish wads of money a royal
crown

The minions pile up whatever they’ve got in front of Gru

contributions A smile creeps across his face as he gets an
idea

Three little kittens with fur all
brushed
Said “We can’t sleep we feel too

like silk

“Fine but at least you should
drink your milk”

He makes the puppets drink milk from the saucer depicted on
the page

Three little kittens with milk all

Mr McDade waxes his car checking his reflection in the
hood Suddenly the ground begins to rumble below his feet
and a shadow covers him He looks up at the huge rocket
taking off from Gru’s backyard His jaw drops
Just then Vector runs up beside McDade McDade watches as
Vector pulls out his squid launcher and aims it at the rocket
and fires
SPLAAAT The squid connects with the rocket and sticks to
it It’s attached to a line which is attached to Vector
Vector hands the gun to Mr McDade The line quickly takes

up slack and--

Gru’s ship appears The rockets power down and it silently
hovers above the lunar surface

SSSSSSSST Doors open and Gru emerges in a space suit He
holds the Shrink Ray in his hands and faces the enormous
lunar body

He stares up at moon Its size is overwhelming He feels
like a speck floating in front of it He smiles and takes
aim at the pale yellow world in front of him Breathes deep
then--

ZZZZZZ22Z2Z22Z2CHEEEEEEEET A BOLT OF ENERGY fires from the
gun and engulfs the moon Then slowly it begins to shrink
Smaller and smaller Gru’s eyes widen as the edges of the
moon come into view

Gru’s hand reaches out to the TINY MOON
GRU
Ha I’ve got it I’ve got the

moon I’ve got the moon

Gru does a flip unhindered by gravity and floats around and
around He’s giddy as a school boy

And then subtly his mood changes Somehow having the moon
isn’t as satisfying as he thought it would be

Silently floating in the vastness of space Gru looks small
and alone And extremely unfulfilled

Just then something drifts out of his pocket It’s the
ticket to the dance recital Gru stares at it Suddenly
wanting to be with the girls more than anything He looks at
his watch
GRU
I can make it

Vector looks a little worried He presses a button that
activates HEAT SEEKING MISSILES
EXT VECTOR’S FORTRESS - SAME

The missiles launch from the fortress Gru watches as they
launch outwards and begin their return towards him

He stands determined and at the last possible second acts
Moving like a maniac-ninja he leaps through the missiles
threading the delicate needle flipping and dodging before
hopping off the last one The missiles careen into Vector’s
fortress walls and explode

Gru begins his unrelenting march to the girls A shark jumps
out of Vector’s moat and dives at him In one punch Gru
knocks the beast back into the water

INT VECTOR’S FORTRESS - SAME

Vector watches this on a monitor Beginning to panic

VECTOR

What He punched my shark
EXT VECTOR’S FORTRESS - SAME
Gru is about to kick down the front door whenTCHROOOOM
The entire building begins to rumble and the entire room
lifts off detaching itself from the rest of the building
It’s an escape pod
Gru sees the pyramid in Vector’s backyard Climbs to the top
he leaps and grabs onto the side of the escape pod
EXT SKY - SAME
SHOOOM The escape pod soars up into the air
SHOOOOOM Gru’s ship piloted by Dr Nefario streaks after
him
INT GRU’S SHIP

DR NEFARIO
There he is

Dr Nefario zooms in on Vector’s escape pod and sees Gru
holding on for dear life
EXT SKY - SAME

Dr Nefario speeds towards Gru

EXT GRU’S SHIP

DR NEFARIO
Hang on Gru

Gru tries to open the hatch but the G-force is too great
Gru loses his grip and starts to fall

DR NEFARIO
Oh no

GRU
Aaaaaaaaaaaah

Gru falls through the open roof-hatch and lands safely
inside He turns and sees several minions in the back of his
ship He sheepishly waves at them They wave back

GRU
Vector has the girls Go

EXT SKY

Gru’s ship speeds through the air

INT GRU’S SHIP

GRU
What happened to the ship It’s big
again

DR NEFARIO
Not as big as the moon’s going to
be

GRU
What

DR NEFARIO
The larger the mass of an object
the quicker the effects of the
shrink ray wear off I call it the
Nefario principle I just came up
with it now actually

GRU
Oh no

INT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD - SAME

The moon begins to grow It crushes the coffee mug that was
holding it

The girls stare at the beach ball sized moon

MARGO
Did you see that

The girls pound on their glass enclosure

GIRLS

Vector Help Over here Help
VECTOR

Hey what are you girls doing back

Vector struggles to keep control of his ship as the moon
rolls

The girls continue to scream as the moon flattens Vector

VECTOR
Ouch

The moon rolls

EXT GRU’S SHIP - SAME
Vector’s ship is flying erratically

GRU
Get as close in as you can

A GRAPPLING HOOK is shot from Gru’s ship It connects with
Vector’s ship

GRU

Nefario holds the ship steady

INT VECTOR’S SHIP

The girls scream as they try to avoid the rapidly expanding
moon

GIRLS
AAAHHHHIIIIIEEEEEE

Suddenly behind them there is a GROAN from the hull of the
ship SCCREEEEEUNNNGH

The rear hatch opens The girls walk to the edge of the
ship

MARGO
Mr Gru up here

AGNES and EDITH
Mr Gru

Gru stands on the wing of his ship and calls up to the girls
GRU
Okay girls girls You’re going
to have to jump

The girls look nervous It’s a big jump

EDITH
Jump Are you INSANE

GRU
Don’t worry I will catch you

Gru holds his arms out wide ready to catch them They
exchange looks Then--

MARGO
You gave us back

GRU
I know I know and it is the worst
mistake I ever made But you have
to jump now

They girls know that Gru is going to be there for them

MARGO
It will be okay

GRU
Okay girls

MARGO
Jump now

Agnes and Edith jump WHOOOOSH They SCREAM as they fall

Gru catches the girls and passes them down to Dr Nefario
Then looks up at Margo who still seems unsure

GRU
Margo I will catch you and I will
never let you go again

Margo takes her glasses off and begins to jump but Vector
grabs her and pulls her back into the ship

VECTOR
Not so fast

GRU
Margo

MARGO

Let me go
Vector laughs as he aims his squid launcher at Gru

GRU
No

Just when he is ready to fire the rapidly expanding moon
knocks him over and pushes Margo out the door

Margo screams as she falls but she is able to grab hold of
the cable that is connecting the two ships together

MARGO
Woah
EXT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD

Vector pulls himself back to safety

EXT GRU’S SHIP

Gru stands on the wing of the plane while the two other girls
watch

Margo is barely holding on

INT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD - SAME

Vector is stuck to the moon after it rolls over him

EXT GRU’S SHIP
Gru walks the cable between the two planes like a tightrope

The shifting planes makes it difficult for him to keep his
balance

INT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD - SAME

Vector is smashed into the side of his ship

EXT GRU’S SHIP

The cable is torn from Vector’s ship Margo and Gru fall
through the air

They both fall screaming when --

Miraculously a YELLOW HAND reaches down and grabs Gru’s
extended arm A chain of minions extends up to Gru’s ship

GRU
I got you

Gru and Margo hang on for dear life swinging in the air

INT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD - SAME

The moon grows quickly crushing everything inside the escape
pod Vector is about to be flattened The moon expands into
the control panel where pushes a large button

EXT VECTOR’S ESCAPE POD —- SAME

The escape pod’s engine fires up to maximum velocity

EXT GRU’S SHIP - NIGHT

Gru holds Margo close as Vector’s escape pod zooms higher
The cable is slowly retracted back into his ship

Just then the moon expands shattering the escape pod KA-
BLAM

VECTOR
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah Nooooooccco000

It hits him and he holds on for dear life as the moon
rockets into space
EXT GRU’S SHIP —- SAME

Gru Nefario and the girls watch

EXT SPACE

The moon expands from a tiny dot in the sky to its normal
size

EXT MOON — SAME

Vector opens his eyes and looks around Sees that he is
alone on the moon which is now full size Scratching his
head

VECTOR
Oh poop

INT TV STUDIO - NIGHT
Our favorite Newscaster is on TV

NEWSCASTER
This time good triumphs and the
moon has been returned to its
rightful place in the sky But
once again law enforcement is
baffled Leaving everyone to
wonder who is this mysterious
hero And what will he do next

INT GIRLS BEDROOM - LATER

Gru walks the girls into their room They are now in their

pajamas and mellowed out

GRU

Okay girls time for bed
EDITH

Aw come on We want a story
AGNES

Three Sleepy Kittens
GRU

Oh no sorry that book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously
Tonight we are going to read a new
book

The girls react Gru got a book He reaches into his coat
and pulls out a homemade book called One Big Unicorn

GRU
This one is calledOne Big
Unicorn Bywho wrote this
oh me I wrote it
Oh look -- it’s a puppet book

He sticks his nose through a hole in the book creating a
horn for the unicorn on the cover

GRU
That’s the horn

The girls laugh at this

AGNES
This is going to be the best book
ever

GRU

Not to pat myself on the back but
yes it probably will be Here we

go
Gru opens it up and begins reading

GRU
One big unicorn strong and free
Thought he was happy as he could
be

The unicorn in Gru’s illustration somehow resembles Gru
himself Gru turns the page

GRU
Then three little kittens came
around
And turned his whole life upside-
down

The three kittens in Gru’s illustration look a lot like
Margo Edith and Agnes Edith points

EDITH
Hey--that one looks like me

GRU
What are you talking about These
are kittens Any relation to
persons living or dead is
completely coincidental

Margo smiles a knowing smile Gru turns the page The
unicorn and the kittens are riding in a roller-coaster

GRU
They made him laugh They made him
cry
He never should have said good-bye

He turns to the last page an image of the unicorn and the
kittens inside a heart

GRU
And now he knows he could never
part
From those three little kittens
that changed his heart
(beat)
The End

He closes the book The girls look at him clearly touched

GRU
Okay alright Goodnight

Gru gets up and heads for the door Turns out the light
Stands there for a bit

Then walks back to Agnes and gives her a kiss goodnight
Then he kisses Edith Then he bends down to kiss Margo--who
gives him a big hug

MARGO
(whispers)
I love you
Gru smiles trying to hold all his emotions inside
GRU
I love you too

INT HALL -— CONTINUOUS

As he enters the hall he sees the Minions assembled for good-
night kisses

GRU
No No

The minions all sigh disappointed

GRU
Oh all right

He kisses them on the heads

A familiar looking minion goes to the front of the line
again

GRU
Didn’t I get you already

The minion giggles and runs off

INT GRU’S UNDERGROUND LAB - NIGHT

Nefario struggles with a video camera Close on a curtain
Classical music begins to play and the curtain opens
revealing Margo Edith and Agnes dressed in their dance
outfits They all move in unison and begin their routine
Gru watches from the front row of the audience beaming

A minion plays the role of DJ and dances a little ballet in
sync with the girls

Gru is the ultimate proud parent

GRU
They’re very good

We now see Nefario is sitting next to Gru filming the
performance

Gru’s Mom sits next to Gru

GRU’S MOM
Oh I’m so proud of you son
Youve turned out to be a great
parent -- just like me Maybe even
better

Gru attempts a smile

Suddenly another minion DJ gets an idea He shoves the
ballet minion out of the way and slaps on some vinyl

YOU SHOULD BE DANCIN’ by the BEEGEES fills our ears The
girls switch into full-on funk mode

Agnes smiles down at Gru and motions for him to come up on
stage with her

Gru smiles and waves her off Then Margo and Edith join in
Waving for him to join them Gru smiles uncomfortably and
waves

GRU
No I’m fine Go ahead

Margo pulls him part way on stage Gru resists and attempts
to sit back down but a wave of minions carries him the rest
of the way

GRU
No no no

GRU
Hey Agh

There’s no getting out of this now He takes the stage and
the crowd goes crazy

Gru takes a deep breath and--
Breaks into a crazy dance routine

The crowd goes crazy Cheering and giving Gru a standing
ovation

Dr Nefario dances on stage with Gru’s Mom

Up on stage Gru looks down at the girls who are
simultaneously stunned and impressed Gru leaps into the air
and prepares to do the splits but instead lands awkwardly on
the stage

VZZZZRRT The stage begins to raise up into the air and the
“moon roof” opens revealing a huge full moon

EXT THE MOON

Vector is moon walking on the moon to the beat of the song
The floating minion dances too

BACK TO SCENE

The platform raises above the houses of the neighborhood and
Gru and the girls stare out at the huge full moon

THE END
