FADE IN

EXT DISMAL SWAMP - NIGHT 2

Moonlight sifts through the tall pines illuminating the fog-
blanketed marsh

CHILDS VOICE (VO)
But the white man he catched her
Catched her an’ throwed her to the
ground

Through the boscage two shrouded figures emerge pacing
stealthily through the brush

CHILD’S VOICE (VO)
But he ain’t know that another man
big like my daddy was behind him

CLOSER to reveal the shadowed features of an African WOMAN
She pulls a YOUNG BOY alongside her- both of whom’s features
we cannot yet clearly see

CHILDS VOICE (VO)
He took a big ol’ stick and hit
that white man all about his head
with it

EXT DISMAL SWAMP - CLEARING - NIGHT 5

Nancy and Nat step into the clearing to find a group of
ELDERLY AFRICANS huddled around a humble fire in fervent
prayer Among the elders we find EZEKIEL (90’s) As if
sensing their arrival his eyes open He motions them
forward Ezekiel speaks in his Native Ghanaian tongue

EZEKIEL
(Remove his garb)

5815 - PINK 3

Nat looks terrified as Nancy removes his shirt Ezekiel
inspects Nat’s arms and back before arriving to his chest

The Elders nudge in the mouthing of passionate prayer never
ceasing Ezekiel points a thin finger to the boy’s sternum

ANGLE ON THREE SLIGHTLY RAISED KNOTS

He points

EZEKIEL (CONTD)
(In the time of our ancestors the
cycle of our people lay in the
hands of the children A man’s
position was left to the signs of
the maker Children bearing marks
were presented before counsel It
was there they were given their
assignments in the tribe-
assignments that would last a
lifetime)

to the first bump on the Nat’s chest

EZEKIEL (CONTD)

(Wisdom)

(the second bump)
(Courage)

(the third)
(Vision)

(a long beat)
(This boy holds the Holy marks of
our ancestors past He was born
to be a prophet)

At the word PROPHET the surrounding Elders’ bodies arch and
rock the intensity of their prayers growing to fever pitch

We PUSH IN on Nat as he struggles to digest the magnitude of
his words CLOSER As divine exaltation fills the surrounding

blur we-

Their whispers cease when SOMETHING crosses outside
disrupting the light

The broad barn door creeks open An ugly shadow tracks across

EXT SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY 9

Isaac enters caked in dirt and sweat Bridget Nancy and Nat
lie asleep Isaac hovers over a bucket of water in a near
corner As he rinses his face a soft MOAN rises from Nat’s
direction

Isaac studies Nat a beat before grabbing a small wooden box
from a shelf Within he finds a CRUMPLED SQUARE OF PAPER He
smooths it against his leg before slipping out the cabin

A long beat until- Nat stirs awake sits up

EXT WOODS - OLD ROAD - NIGHT 16

Isaac pushes through the woods staying close to the main
road A SOUND in the distances stops him in his tracks He
grips a bulky stash under his shirt as he squints into the
dark As his eyes focus on a shadowed figure ahead-

CLICK
He turns to find three men THE PATTY-ROLLERS atop horses
Theyre dressed similarly in worn pea coats each coat
bearing a dull BRASS STAR RAYMOND COBB (40s the leader)
holds a pistol leveled at Isaac’s head
COBB

his gaze It’s NAT

COBB (CONTD)

WITH ISAAC as he slowly lowers Just as his knees touch the
ground he-

-lunges for the gun BANG The gun goes off catching the
third pattyroller in the chest Isaac and Cobb wrestle for
the pistol as Jesse struggles for a clean shot Isaac head-
butts Cobb sending the gun flying Before Cobb can recover
Isaac grabs a nearby branch CLUBS him across the face A
gash opens spilling blood Isaac sprints into the woods On
Cobb and Jesse firing wildly into the treeline

GLASS JAR lies just several inches from his heel Cobb
uncurls a dirty index finger points it to Nancy then to
Nat As he leans in his weight shifts on the wooden plank
the tin can slowly rolls towards his foot

JOSEPH RANDALL (CONT’D)
Day or so back had a few quit on

Wouldn’t even come out the quarter
So I locked ‘em up the lot of ‘em
Hoping the heat and hunger would
bring about their senses All that

Through sad eyes Nat studies the sea of skeletal faces and
festering whip wounds He swallows peels open his Bible

up the fiddle sit around the fire
and tell old lies

Just then Randall’s daughter LILLY emerges from inside
She dons a white dress with a matching ribbon in her hair As
she gleefully descends the stairs we notice a tweed rope in
her grip We follow its length to the opposite end to find-
It’s tied around the neck of a NINE YEAR OLD SLAVE GIRL

Despite his gaunt features and the infected puss bubbles
protruding from his back he supports his own weight

eye contact Something unnerving about his subservience

Nat lies on a cot his back covered with steaming strips of
cotton Bridget sits at his side Nancy arrives with a thin
blade and a bottle of brown liquid Bridget slowly peels back
a cotton strip to reveal an infested wound She takes the
blade cuts a shallow incision into the bubbled flesh

BRIDGET
I watched your grandfather die In
the old land Saw him give up the
ghost with my own eyes And he saw
me He harnessed the Holy Spirit
that day Yes he did

She applies pressure to the wounds sending blood and puss
oozing from his flesh

BRIDGET (CONT’D)
I was proud of him So proud I
still thank God he died that day
That he didn’t live to see what I
seen To watch a strong man
broken down is a terrible thing

Hey Nana

Nat grimaces as he peels off his shirt Several lines of
fresh stitches

Nat rinses his hands and face in a nearby pot of water
suddenly stops He looks to Bridget walks to her

Her lifeless eyes fixed forward A needle and thread rests
between her fingers a half sewn pair of pants in her lap

INT SLAVE QUARTERS - NANA’S CABIN - DAY 102

TIGHT on Nat’s face His eyes cast down at something we don’t
yet see We PULL BACK to reveal Bridget’s body wrapped head
to toe in linen on a plank table behind him We continue to
pull back to find his eyes set on his closed Bible He flips
toward the back

“Ephesians 65-6 - Servants be obedient to them that are
masters

“Matthew 538 -If anyone strikes you on the right cheek
“Luke 627 Do good to those who hate you bless those who
curse you”

A SERIES OF QUICK FLASHBACKS

-- The slave’s teeth hammered out-

-- The young slave girl led on a leash-

-- Cherry beaten and bruised-

-- The blood seeping from the corn onto his hand-

He slowly rises moves to Bridget’s wrapped body He lifts it
and carries her out of frame We move in close on the Bible
Closer until a verse fills the frame

it couldnt have been entirely
productive

Now I don’t know what ideas swirl
in your head but I’ve lived enough
to know the result of certain ideas
wont lead to what you want

All I want I want for the
oppressed people of God

ISAIAH
Do you want death for them For

are wrong for what they’ve done and
continually do But I also know a

to help in the house

ELIZABETH TURNER
Our hands often go from field to
house when needed Not every family
treats their slaves with your level
of savagery

GENERAL CHILDS
Not every slave treats their
masters with the level of savagery
yours done

of paper General Childs examines it

several coins

He offers a solemn smile before he joins General Childs his
Lieutenant and Simon They exit leaving only silence until-

A BANG OS
Elizabeth rushes to the window to see Simon dead on the lawn

General Childs mounts his horse tips his hat to Elizabeth
before he and his men head off

EXT DISMAL SWAMP - DAY 145

Militia men scour the swampy woods We spot John Clark among
them crossing a trickling creek He slows to a stop looks to
his left and right

EXT DISMAL SWAMP - DAY (VISION 4) 146

Nat kneels in prayer A SOUND from behind and his eyes open
He turns to find a YOUNG BOY we recognize as YOUNG NAT
painted royal blue (The scene mirrors Nats childhood
vision) Demonic sounds permeate the forest Nat stands
strides towards his younger self placing a protective hand
in front of him WIDER to reveal Nat is alone He stalks
toward us and past camera

EXT FARMERS MARKET - WOOD AND SEED - DAY 147

Several stores have reopened General childs sits under a
military tent as his boots are shined A few militia men
loiter nearby Scattered locals crisscross the dusty square

FURTHER AWAY

Nat enters an empty frame We take in his sunken eyes and
gaunt frame as he lumbers forward His bullet wound festers
spilling puss

ANGLE ON
A WHITE MAN who spots Nat

WHITE MAN
Hey

As he sprints toward Nat others also recognize him breaking
into hysterics The white man arrives to nat wasting no time
in connecting a wild blow to Nat’s face

Dozens more follow suit until a massive mob has formed
raining blows onto Nat’s body A woman rips at his shirt as
the energy of the lynch mob intensifies until-

BANG

The crowd freezes We REVERSE to reveal GENERAL CHILDS holds
the smoking gun He’s flanked by his lieutenant

GENERAL CHILDS
I know you’re angry trust me I
understand But this man has
committed mass murder and will
stand trial

5815 - PINK 103A

As he approaches the mob reluctantly backs off General
Childs arrives to Nat who lies in a bloody heap The
lieutenant and another soldier rip Nat to his feet and away

INT JERUSALEM - CELL - DAY 149
Nat sits eyes fixed forward A SHERIFF appears at the bars

SHERIFF
It’s time

EXT JERUSALEM - COURTHOUSE - DAY 150

Follow a YOUNG BOY as he crosses cobblestone road up a
flight of stairs pushing his way through a surrounding mob
As he steps onto a cross-bridge we rise above him to reveal-

THE COURTHOUSE SQUARE Hundreds crowd in front of a stage-
like platform others watch from roofs windows and stairs

EXT JERUSALEM - COURTHOUSE - DAY 151

Nat is led up a narrow staircase and onto the wooden
platform He studies the multitude of people

ANGLE ON

A viewing platform where Nat spots John Clark who stands at
the flank of General childs A million words unspoken Nats
eyes then drift to Jasper who stands amongst patrons Nat
studies Jasper who struggles to hold his gaze

Nat’s face softens a beat as he offers the faintest nod of
forgiveness The sheriff motions for the roaring crowd to
settle Within minutes the area is near silent save a few
scattered slurs

SHERIFF
(to Nat)
Somethin’ you’d like to say to
these people first

Nat regards the people Then with a firm voice-

NAT
Im ready

The sheriff exits and the crowd’s energy escalates to near
fever pitch The UNDERTAKER fits a noose around Nat’s neck
Draws the rope of the pulley and Nat’s body rises several
feet above the platform

SOUND DROPS Not a limb or a muscle moves as Nat hangs still
as a stone

5815 - PINK 105A
151 151

CLOSE On Nat’s face as he stares forward as if frozen UNTIL

5815 - PINK 106 151

Something above catches his eye His eyes flit upward toward
something we don’t yet see

Nat’s POV to reveal-
A WHITE DOVE CIRCLES JUST ABOVE

ON NAT Even through the pain the slightest smile grows
Seconds later we watch his eyes slowly CLOSE

ON JASPER who squeezes his eyes shut his body trembling
through sobs

PUSH IN on Jasper CLOSER until his face fills the frame

We watch as he AGES before our eyes His features mature his
jaw widens age lines crawl across his brow He slowly opens

his eyes and we see Jasper now a grown man The shame gone

only a fierceness remains

We slowly pull back as sound gradually returns Muffled
blasts and explosions permeate We continue our pull to
reveal-

EXT BATTLEFIELD —- DAY 152

Jasper dons a blue FORAGE HAT and SACK COAT white-knuckling
a bayonet-fitted rifle We reveal other black soldiers on
either side A massive AMERICAN FLAG ripples in the BG The
explosions are now deafening as the group of men clinch their
jaws in anticipation After an arduous beat-

VOICE (0C)
CHARGE

Jasper and his fellow soldiers belt out battle cries as they
rush the camera bayonets pointed Jasper raises his rife and
BANG A cloud of smoke takes us to-

BLACK

SUPER

After Nat Turner’s hanging his body was skinned and
dismembered His skin was sewn into wallets and purses his

flesh churned into grease- all to be sold at the local
market
