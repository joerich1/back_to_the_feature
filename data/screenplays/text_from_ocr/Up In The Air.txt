A SPOTLIGHT reveals RYAN BINGHAM standing at a PODIUM
He unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him

RYAN
How much does your life weigh

Ryan pauses to let us consider this

RYAN (CONTD)
Imagine for a second that youre

carrying a backpack I want you
to feel the straps on your
shoulders You feel them

(gives us a beat)

Now I want you to pack it with all
the stuff you have in your life
Start with the little things The
stuff in drawers and on shelves
The collectables and knick-knacks
Feel the weight as it adds up Now
start adding the larger stuff Your
clothes table top appliances
lamps linens your TV That
backpack should be getting pretty
heavy at this point - Go Bigger
Your couch your bed your kitchen
table Stuff it all in Your car
get it in there Your home
whether you have a studio apartment
or a two story house I want you to
stuff it into that backpack
Ryan takes a beat to let the weight sink in

RYAN (CONTD)
Now try to walk

We hear people around us chuckling Ryan smiles Reveal

INT HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

The kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats
and lower income weddings

The few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told

RYAN (CONTD)
Kinda hard isnt it This is what
we do to ourselves on a daily
basis We weigh ourselves down
until we cant even move And make
no mistake - Moving is living

We see nodding Peoples gears turning

RYAN (CONTD)
Now Im going to set your backpack
on fire What do you want to take
out of it Photos Photos are for
people who cant remember Drink
some gingko and let the photos
burn In fact let everything burn
and imagine waking up tomorrow with
nothing
(a beat of emphasis)
Its kind of exhilarating isnt it
That is how I approach every day

A titter through the crowd

INT BOEING 757 - DAY
A FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT is looking directly at us

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Do you want the cancer

Turn to see RYAN looking back
Handsome Anonymous Right now - Confused

RYAN
Excuse me

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(SAME DELIVERY)
Do you want the cancer

Ryan furrows - What the hell is going on here

The flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a CAN OF
SODA

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
The can sir

RYAN
Oh No Um no thank you

The flight attendant moves to the next aisle Ryan takes a
beat then returns to his work

INT SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM SUN CASUALTY - DAY

Two words - Subordinate chic

Seated at a tiny table is RYAN The Grim Reaper in a suit

We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being
fired They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent
layoffs) that can react organically to the news with
authenticity Some are hurt Others are upset and even
abusive The series concludes with

STEVE (AN ACTOR)

RYAN (VO)

BACK TO

INT SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Steve is trying to hold it together

RYAN (VO)
And thats where I come in

STEVE
What did I do What could I have
done differently here

RYAN
This is not an assessment of your
productivity Its important not to
personalize this

Steve scoffs at this

Ryan slides Steve a PACKET

RYAN (CONTD)
Steve I want you to review this
packet Take it seriously I think
youre going to find a lot of
answers in there

STEVE

(DISMISSIVE)
Oh Im sure its going be really
helpful

RYAN (CONTD)
Look anybody who ever built an
empire or changed the world sat
where you are now And its because
they sat there that they were able
to do it

And just for a moment Steve looks hopeful

RYAN (CONTD)
Im going to need your key card

STEVE
Right

Steve begins removing it from his wallet

RYAN
Take the day Put together your
personal things Talk to your co-
workers Tomorrow go out and get
some exercise Go for a jog Give
yourself routines and pretty soon
youll find your legs

Steve nods and gets up to leave Just as hes about to walk
out he stops and turns back

STEVE
Wait how do I get in touch with you

RYAN

Dont worry Well be in touch

soon This is just the beginning

Steve nods and exits the room

RYAN (VO)

Ill never see Steve again

INT RYANS ROOM - PHOENIX HILTON - DAY

The choreography of Ryans packing is worthy of Tchaikovsky

away bag A hand flips a light switch without looking

INT LOBBY PHOENIX HILTON - DAY

God-forbid silver I might have

overlooking the tarmac

RYAN (VO)

All the things you probably hate
about travelling - The recycled air
The artificial lighting The digital
juice dispensers and mini pizzas
stacked to their heat lamps are the
warm reminders that I am home

With that comment Ryan slides into a leather club seat A
DIGITAL DISPLAY reads Thank You For Your Loyalty

He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY He scans
it We see a string of flights car rentals and stays at
Hitons Then something makes him frown He pulls out his
cell phone and dials

Auto industry is in the dump
Housing market doesnt have a
heartbeat This is our moment Its
one of the worst times on record
for America and I dont want to
be standing here two years from
now wondering how we missed this
window of opportunity

A strangely encouraged response from the group

CRAIG GREGORY (CONTD)

Now last Summer we received a
dynamite young woman by way of
Cornell She challenged us with some
big ideas My first reaction was who
does this kid think she is But when I
started to give a listen I was pretty
knocked out So now with a little
peek into our future - Natalie Keener

you with today its this

Ned smiles People chuckle in the conference room One guy
jokes Dont count on it

NATALIE (CONTD)
Ned could be any employee in any one
of our clients locations worldwide
Strategy packets would be shipped in
advance Ned would be given a seat
and find one of our transition
specialists waiting for him

Natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire Ned It is
a pretty dry process and lacks Ryans charm

NATALIE (CONTD)
Mr Laskin the reason were having
this conversation today is your
position is no longer available

NED
(from a script)
I dont understand Im fired

NATALIE
Hearing the words Youve been let
go is never easy Change is always
scary But consider the following -
(using Ryans line)

Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world sat where you
are now And its because they sat
there that they were able to do it

RYAN

(QUIETLY)
Thats my fucking line

NED

Well what happens now

NATALIE
This is the first step of a process
that will end with you in a new job
that fulfills you

NED
Yeah but how does it work

NATALIE
I want you to take that packet in
front of you

Ned picks up the packet

NATALIE (CONTD)
Review it All the answers youre
looking for are inside Start
filling out the necessary
information and before you know it
youll be on your way to new
opportunities

Ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest

NATALIE (CONTD)
Now Ned Im going to need you to
go back to your desk and start
putting together your things As a
favor to me Id appreciate it if
you didnt spread the news just
yet Panic doesnt help anybody

NED
I understand

NATALIE
Have a good day Mr Laskin and
good luck with your future

NED
Thank you

Ned gets up and goes to leave

NATALIE

People clap and tease him a little

systematic Hes just about finished when he notices the

clear that the photo is two inches to long He tries putting
it on an angle but that doesnt help

RYAN
Huh

Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it
but he cant get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo
For a moment it almost seems like hes assaulting their
head with the zipper handle Doesnt help
A moment of silent frustration

CUT TO

sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag The
two zippers have been closed on either side of them as

BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid-
twenties Hes not thrilled by the public affection After a
beat they break and he exits

NATALIE

Im building a work flow of firing
techniques Questions and responses
Actions and reactions A script that
works kind of like a tributary
taking you through the steps of
firing someone

RYAN
Who is it for

NATALIE
Theoretically you could put it in
the hands of anybody and they could
be downsizing immediately All they
have to do is follow the steps

RYAN
Natalie what is it you think we
do here

NATALIE

We prepare the newly unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdles
of job hunting while Minimizing
potential legal blowback

RYAN
Thats what were selling But its
not what were doing

NATALIE
Okay what are we doing

RYAN
Our job is to make limbo tolerable -
To ferry wounded souls across the
river of dread and humiliation to
the point at which hopes bright
shore is dimly visible
(FRANKLY)
And then to stop the boat shoveem
in the water and make them swim
while we row back to the palace of
their banishment to present the
employers with our bills

boards pick a place and go

A mop of tears Ryan looks around for a place to set her
down Instead he finds

ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing
girl

RYAN
Hi Alex this is Natalie Natalie
this is my friend Alex

ALEX
I should give you both a moment

Natalie attempts a recovery Its not graceful
NATALIE
No its fine Im fine Just
stupid emotions

Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake

ALEX

Ryan goes to challenge the idea when

NATALIE
Now were talking

Natalie leads the way Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos

cut To

THE SCREEN OF NATALIES CELL PHONE

TEXT READS I Think its time we c other people

INT BAR LOUNGE - MIAMI HILTON - MOMENTS LATER

The three share a booth Natalie is sipping a drink She
seems
to have settled a little

ALEX
He broke up with you over text
message

RYAN

(SOFT DIG)
Thats kind of like firing people
over the internet

Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look

ALEX
(re the ex-boyfriend)
What a weasely prick

NATALIE
Yeah but what does that make me
Someone who falls for a prick

ALEX
We all fall for them Pricks are
spontaneous unpredictable and
fun And then were surprised when
they turn out to be pricks

NATALIE
I followed him to Omaha

RYAN
You did

NATALIE
I had a job waiting for me in San
Fran when he got an offer from
ConAgra He told me we could start
a life together So I followed him

RYAN
To Nebraska

NATALIE
I look in the mirror and I just see
compromise Im supposed to do
something

ALEX

Youll do plenty

NATALIE
I just cant I thought Id be
engaged by now

(CATCHES HERSELF)
No offense

ALEX RYAN
Its alright None taken

NATALIE
When I was sixteen I thought by
twenty three I would be married
maybe have a kid Corner office
by day entertaining at night I
was supposed to be driving a Grand
Cherokee by now

ALEX
Life can underwhelm you that way

NATALIE
Now I have my sights on twenty
nine because thirty is just way
too apocalyptic I mean where
did you think youd be by

Natalie catches herself having no idea how old Alex is

ALEX
It doesnt work that way

RYAN
At a certain point you stop with
the deadlines

ALEX
They can be a little counterproductive

NATALIE
I dont want to say anything
thats anti-feminist I mean I

really appreciate everything your
generation did for me

ALEX
(my generation)
It was our pleasure

RYAN
Well done

NATALIE
But sometimes it feels like no
matter how much success I have it
all wont matter until I find the
right guy

ALEX

You really thought this guy was the one

NATALIE
Yeah I guess I dont know I
could have made it work He just
really fit the bill

RYAN
The bill

NATALIE
My type You know white collar
College grad Loves dogs Likes funny
movies Six foot one Brown hair
Kind eyes Works in finance but is
Outdoorsy you know on the weekends
(we think shes done)
I always imagined hed have a
single syllable name like Matt or
John or Dave In a perfect
world he drives a Four Runner and
the only thing he loves more than
me is his golden lab Oh and a
nice smile
(back to Alex and Ryan)
How about you

This catches both Alex and Ryan off guard

RYAN
Im not sure if

NATALIE
I meant Alex

RYAN
Right

ALEX

Huh let me think for a sec

(mulls it over)

Well by the time youre thirty four
all the physical requirements are
pretty much out the window I mean you
secretly prey hell be taller than you

Ryan smiles
ALEX (CONTD)
Not an asshole would be nice Just
someone who enjoys my company Comes
from a good family - You dont think
about that when youre younger
(THINKING)
Wants kids Likes kids
(MORE)

ALEX (CONTD)
Wants kids Healthy enough to play
catch with his future son one day

We can tell Ryan is taking a serious interest in this

ALEX (CONTD)
Please let him earn more than I do
That doesnt make sense now but
believe me it will one day Otherwise
its just a recipe for disaster
(REACHING)
Hopefully some hair on his head
But its not exactly a deal-breaker
anymore Nice smile Yep a nice
smile just might do it

Alex looks to Ryan He has a nice smile

NATALIE
Wow That was depressing

Alex and Ryan react - Its not that bad

NATALIE (CONTD)
I should just date lesbians

ALEX
Tried it Were no picnic
ourselves

Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started

NATALIE
I dont mind being married to my
career and I dont expect it to
hold me in bed as I fall asleep
(LOOKS UP)
I just dont want to settle

ALEX
Youre young Right now you see
settling as some sort of failure

NATALIE
It is By definition

ALEX
Dont worry by the time someone is
right for you it wont feel like
settling And the only person
left to judge you will be the
twenty four year old girl witha
target on your back

Natalie cracks a smile

Ryan looks to Alex Theyve grown closer

INT LOBBY LOUNGE MIAMI HILTON - DAY

EXT BOAT - NIGHT

A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
the bubble popped Inside the galley a group is playing
karaoke NATALIE wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads is
singing Time After Time

Meanwhile near the back Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
hanging off the back of the hull

ALEX
Back home I dont get to act the way
I do with you

RYAN
Thats why I dont have a back home

ALEX
I know Youre so cool Mr Empty
Back Pack

Ryan emotionally stumbles

RYAN
You know about the back pack

ALEX
I googled you

RYAN
You did

ALEX

Its what us modern girls do when
we have a crush

RYAN
Did it bother you

ALEX
Well that depends Is the bag
empty because you hate people or
just the baggage they bring along

RYAN
I dont hate people Im not
exactly a hermit

ALEX
You just dont want to be tied down
The whole responsibility thing

RYAN
I dont think its even that
I First time I ever flew I was
sixteen

ALEX
Youre not going to answer Youre
just going to tell me a story

RYAN

(smiles continues story)
It was January and I had just
gotten my drivers license The
lakes were frozen over so we piled
into my car and hit the ice to do
donuts When out of nowhere I hit
a soft spot and the hood of my car
tilted up and I was sinking
backwards into the water

ALEX
Jesus

RYAN
I literally started to drown
Within a few seconds I black out
Then I wake up in the sky Im ina
helicopter laying on a stretcher
This guy in a uniform is telling me I
was minutes away from dying

ALEX
Oh my God

RYAN
Right

(relives it for a second)
So just as were hovering over the
hospital I sit up And from there
I could see the whole western
horizon Wed been flying twenty
minutes Twenty minutes to reach a
city Id thought of as remote
halfway across the state a
foreign capital

(A BEAT)
My parents had taught me we lived
in the best place on Earth but now
I could see the world was really
just one place and comparing didnt
make much sense And I remember
thinking - Dont tell me this isnt
previous

and

an age of miracles Dont tell me
we cant be everywhere at once

The idea settles in Ryan returns to the point

RYAN
I dont know what originally
sparked the back pack I probably
needed to be alone Recently Ive
been thinking that maybe I needed
to empty the bag before I knew what
to put back in

And now they kiss Its notably different from their

kisses Now when they lock lips we are reminded why people
kiss in the first place

Then all of a sudden the lights go out on the boat The
motor has stopped Ryan and Alex look back to find the
software dude stepping out of the galley drunk

SOFTWARE DUDE
Hey I think were out of gas

Ryan and Alex look out to shore about 500 yards away For
whatever reason they just start cracking up

EXT PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT

Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of

splashes up to shore

They kiss again and he lets go Alex leaves and the door
closes Ryan just lays in bed for a moment

INT CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING

In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls He
perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable

Meanwhile after a little silent eating

NATALIE
Last night got a little out of
hand I said things I dont

remember everything I said I just
didnt want you to think

RYAN
Just relax It was nice to see you
cut loose So did you wake him up
or slip out

NATALIE
What
RYAN
This morning Your new friend

Did you wake him for an awkward
good bye or just slip out so he
could feel like a whore

NATALIE
(NOT PROUD)
I just left

RYAN
Protocol is always tricky

NATALIE
I didnt know what was right

RYAN
Sometimes there really is no right
thing to do

This doesnt comfort her

EXT OCEAN BOARDWALK MIAMI - DAY

RYAN
Never thought about it Whats

NATALIE
Really never thought about it

RYAN
(a good lie)
No

NATALIE
How can you not think about these
things How does it not even cross
your mind that you might want to
have a future with somebody

RYAN
Its simple you know that moment
when you look into someones eyes
and you feel them looking right
into your soul and the whole world
goes quiet for a second

NATALIE
(finally a break through)
Yes

RYAN

Right Well I dont

NATALIE
Youre an asshole

Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up

RYAN
Oh come on Im just dicking
around I need your help

NATALIE
Dont you think its worth giving
her a chance

RYAN
A chance to what

NATALIE
A chance at something real

RYAN
Natalie your definition of real
is going to evolve as you get
older

NATALIE
Would you stop condescending for
one second Or is that one of the
principles of your bullshit
philosophy

RYAN
Bullshit philosophy

NATALIE
The isolation The traveling Is
that supposed to be charming
boardwalk

RYAN
No its simply a life choice

NATALIE
Its a cocoon of self-banishment

RYAN
Wow Big words

NATALIE
Screw you

RYAN

Well screw you too

NATALIE
Youve set up a way of life that
basically makes it impossible for
you to make any human connections
Now somehow this woman runs the
gauntlet of your ridiculous life
choice and comes out the other end
with a smile - Just so you can call
her casual Jesus I need to grow
up Youre a twelve year old

Natalie begins walking away

RYAN
I dont have a gauntlet of

An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and
takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL

(for the remainder of the scene we will intercut between
Natalies room and the POV of the mans iChat session)

NATALIE
Hello Mr Samuels My name is
Natalie Keener

SAMUELS

SAMUELS

Ryan fights the urge to jump in He is sitting next to
Natalie but just out of view of the camera

NATALIE
Its perfectly normal to be upset
However the sooner you can tell
yourself that there are greater
opportunities waiting for you

SAMUELS
Greater opportunities Im fifty-
seven-fucking years old

Mr Samuels is now on the verge of tears Eyes red

NATALIE
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world sat where you
are now And its because they sat
there that they were able to do it

We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan but we hear Mr
Samuels crying Its loud and embarrassing Its coming from
the next room Hes literally on the other side of the wall

NATALIE (CONTD)
Theres a packet in front of you

Samuels picks up the packet and opens it

NATALIE (CONTD)
I want you to take some time and
review it

Samuels begins to leaf through

NATALIE (CONTD)
All the answers youre looking for
are inside those pages
(MORE)

NATALIE (CONTD)
The sooner you trust the process
the sooner your next step in life
will unveil itself

Samuels puts down the packet The tears still coming slowly
NATALIE (CONTD)

I need you to return to your office

now and begin to put together your

personal things

Samuels doesnt move Hes just sitting there ina daze

NATALIE (CONTD)
Thank you for your time Mr Samuels

No reaction Just more silent tears Natalie is getting

nervous
NATALIE (CONTD)

Ryan fights the urge to break in as Natalie continues to
lose

her composure

staring

up

Craig leans into his computer watching intently

NATALIE (CONTD)

SAMUELS

Finally Samuels breaks from his daze He looks up and
for a second then gets up and leaves

You must be Alex You are so
beautiful Kara was right Did you

The basket was very lovely

JULIE
Tammy wrapped all of them

Tammy waves

JULIE (CONTD)
Ryan you look so grown up

RYAN
Me Youre the one getting married

JULIE
I know right You havent even
seen my ring

Julie shows off her ring Its not quite balanced and seems
to favor quantity over quality

JULIE (CONTD)
(PROUDLY)
Jim designed it

JIM raises a hand This is Julies husband-to-be and we can
tell immediately that Ryan isnt thrilled

Ryan thinks of something He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they
took of the JIM and JULIE CUT OUT

RYAN
I brought those photos you were

asking for

JULIE
(LIGHTS UP)
Oh great They go over there

Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over When he gets

there
we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America
Its
overwhelming All of a sudden his effort seems miniscule
Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities
where they were taken He backs away to see it as a whole
and

his addition has already become invisible
Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex

RYAN
There were quite a few already up
there Almost couldnt find room

JULIE
I know isnt it great how everyone
chipped in

RYAN
What gave you the idea to do
something so

ALEX
(HELPS)
Substantial

JULIE
Well Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate
venture right now So when we went
over our finances a honeymoon just
didnt seem affordable this
second So I thought Hey just
because we cant travel doesnt
mean we cant have pictures

The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard

ALEX
It was a great idea

chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama

JIM

foothills I subdivided the old
Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice
for myself

RYAN

Jim makes an exhale noise that means you bet your ass

JIM
Homes will go in the high fours

Must be a nice development

JIM

(CORRECTING)
Its a community not a development
The concept is turn-key everything
You buy a maintenance contract with
the home Well whack your weeds
well even change the light bulb
Furniture You buy your own or choose
a package Seamless traditionalism
yet all the perks

RYAN
Nice

Ryan and Alex make eye contact Theres a joy in their
connection amongst the ramblings of their company
