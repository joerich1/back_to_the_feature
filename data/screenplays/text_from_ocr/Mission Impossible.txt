INT KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT

Were in a large closet JACK KIEFER an athletic American
in his late thirties wearing a headset is wedged into a
corner staring at a television screen

The television shows a surveillance view of the living room
that lies outside the confines of the closet The TV image
is in black and white JACK shifts trying like hell to get
comfortable but hes been there a while

ON THE SCREEN

A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
room Directly under the blub a man GENNADY KASIMOV sits
in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-
shirt There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the
room behind him A legend

KIEV

KASIMOV is sobbing Uncontrollably A MAN enters the room
ANATOLY an imperious Russian in his forties a Russian
godfather The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out ANATOLY
looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
by him in a chair he picks up for him KASIMOV does as he is
bid looking gratefully up at ANATOLY They speak in Russian
which is subtitled

ANATOLY
Kasimov Kasimov good that you called

us
KASIMOV
(sobbing)
I dont remember what happened We were
at the bar drinking laughing -- having
fun

ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
room A WOMAN lies half under the sheets Shes lying in an
unnatural position on the bed and the sheets are smeared
with blood Shes dead ANATOLY lifts her eyelid

KASIMOV
I dont even know how I got here
I swear Anatoly I never touched her I
didnt lay a finger on her
ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN

ANATOLY
Kasimov Dont flounder

IN THE CLOSET
JACK impatient checks his watch
JACK
Jesus shes been under too long Come

ON THE SCREEN

KASIMOV
Youre the only one who can help me

Desperately he tugs at ANATOLYS jacket But ANATOLY hits
his hand away and smacks him around the head

IN THE CLOSET

JACK reacts

ON THE SCREEN

ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV

ANATOLY
Cmon cmon tell the truthcmon

KASIMOV

ANATOLY paces up the room away from KASIMOV

Back on screen ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOVS shoulder
as if he had just anointed him

IN THE CLOSET
In the closet JACK types the name into a computer and cross
checks -- MIEDIEV comes up then postingAmerican
consulateKiev

JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in
the closet next to him dressed in traditional Russian tunic
and virtually no bottom She quickly leaves

INT SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT

We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does
Shes carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot
glasses

ANATOLY
Now we drink

He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV

ANATOLY (CONTD)
To friends

KASIMOV
Yes Anatoly yes

JACK
Cheers

He drinks He blinks Something felt funny about that
Dizzied KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor ANATOLY
moves to the closet door and opens it

IN THE CLOSET
ANATOLY reaches up to his face --

--and tears away a mask of flesh Hes no middle aged
Russian mobster hes ETHAN HUNT an American in his early
thirties He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously JACK hands
ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the
room

ETHAN
(in English now)
Get rid of this scum

Immediately there is activity and PEOPLE everywhere TWO
OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out

ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman He cheeks
the pulse in her neck shines a penlight in her eye He
strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the
dead womans thigh He checks her pulse again checking a
stopwatch In about ten seconds the womans eyes open

CLAIRE is her name a French woman of thirty or so She half
rolls over GROANS and wipes some of the blood from her
mouth

CLAIRE
Did we get it

ETHAN
We got it On your feet

CLAIRE
I want to sleep Can I sleep here

ETHAN
Walk just walk Start walking

CLAIRE
Im walking

ETHAN
Talkings good walkings better

CLAIRE
Sleepings better

Meanwhile MEN in overalls take apart the room The ceiling
lifts right off the walls and the walls themselves start to
come down revealing the hotel room to be an elaborate set
in the middle of an empty warehouse

JACK comes into the room from the closet He hands CLAIRE
her jewelry including a watch and a wedding ring ETHAN
stops what hes doing noticing She looks up at him
questioningly

CLAIRE
Are you all right Ethan Whats wrong
with you

ETHAN
If youre gonna do this again Claire
Its not gonna be on my watch

CLAIRE
Oh yeah

JACK comes into the room from the closet He hands CLAIRE
her jewelry including a watch and a wedding ring ETHAN
stops what hes doing noticing She looks up at him
questioningly

JACK
Claire

ETHAN
Jack

She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her
finger ETHAN notices He turns and SHOUTS to the room at
large

ETHAN
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WERE NOT
OUT OF HERE YET

JACK
Just waiting for you tubs

He walks across the room and out the door CLAIRE worried
clutches her hands together glancing down at her wedding
ring

We move in on it --
CuT TO
INT JET - DAY

-- and come out on another wedding ring this one on a MANs
finger One of several hes drumming on an arm rest in the
plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner He shoves
some money into his wallet and as he does so we catch a
fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE

The pilots voice makes an announcement

VOICE (0S)
Ladies and gentlemen we have leveled off
at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight
thousand feet-and we should be arriving
in Prague right on schedule

A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats passing
out menus

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen

A passenger takes one The ATTENDANT continues on

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(CONTD)
Would you like to watch a movie Mr
Phelps

The MAN with the wedding ring looks up JIM PHELPS is in his
mid-forties good-looking intense Hes a tired man and
not just now its a profound fatigue He looks up at the
ATTENDANT and smiles warmly

PHELPS
No I prefer the theatre

A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS face her tone becomes
stilted

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Would you consider the cinema of the
Ukraine

PHELPS
Perhaps youd choose one for me

The ATTENDANT turns and walks away PHELPS sits back shakes

a cigarette out of a pack and taps it nervously on the
armrest

AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN

The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8
cassettes of feature films She opens a panel in the top of
the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there

BACK AT PHELPS SEAT

The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS
He takes it without a word and she moves on

PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between
his seat and the empty one beside him He flips up a small
movie screen and angles it toward himself away from the
other passengers He puts on a headset opens a door in the
armrest and puts the tape in

He presses play
ON THE TAPE

the image of a man comes on EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish
but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed
glasses short short haircut rather be caught dead than
tieless But if he catches your eye he will never ever
look away Hes seated at a desk looking into the camera
KITTRIDGE
(on the tape)
Good morning Mr Phelps The man youre
about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn --

The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN a burly man
in his forties The image is herky-jerky videotape
presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks
down a foreign street

KITTRIDGE (0S)
-- a former KGB Line X officer now
working the international black market
selling intelligence This morning we
learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list the list of our non-
official cover agents working in Eastern
Europe

The screen shows an image of what such a list might look
like code names and other information scrolling by on a
computer screen at high speed

KITTRIDGE (0S)
For security reasons the NOC list is
divided into two encoded halves
Golitsyn already has the cryptonym
portion which contains agent code names
and targeting areas This portion is
useless unless combined with the second
half -- the true name list that is kept
in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague

The Embassy itself comes on screen a beautiful old building
at the base of the Charles Bridge which spans the Vltava
River

KITTRIDGE (0S)
We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the
true name list at an Embassy function
tomorrow night Your mission should you
decide to accept it is to obtain
photographic proof of the theft apprehend
those involved and return the stolen
list I dont have to stress the
importance of this matter Jim Were
keeping it internally black Because of
its urgency Ive already sent to Prague
a team selected from your usual group

Still photographs come on screen some of which were already
seen -- JACK KIEFER CLAIRE and ETHAN

KITTRIDGE (0S)
Ethan Hunt will of course be your point
man as usual Hes in Kiev were
getting word to him now

INT JET - DAY

PHELPS sits back in his seat closes his eyes and rubs his
tired brow KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape

KITTRIDGE (0S)
As always should you or any member of
your IM force be caught or killed the
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of
your actions This tape will self-
destruct in five seconds Good luck
Jim

PHELPS inhales deeply --

-- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder sending up a
plume of wispy smoke --

-- and PHELPS exhales concealing the plume in a cloud of
cigarette smoke

EXT PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY

PHELPS
(laughs)
Ah God forget it What are we talking
burnout here

ETHAN
I guess

PHELPS
Ethan you cant burn out

ETHAN
Why not

PHELPS
Because I cant afford it And because
youd burn up before youd burn out

CLAIRE who is at the computer behind them somehow seems to
be the reference point in the following exchange

ETHAN
How was Chicago

PHELPS
Wonderful Ran into a convention of auto
dealers at the Drake Hotel You hear the
one about the astronaut who comes back
from the first manned flight to Mars
after two years His wifes got a year

friend Lou No whats the matter

own

PHELPS laughs ETHAN doesnt The back of CLAIRES head is
in his line of sight

PHELPS (CONTD)
Boy you really are grim Come here

He leads ETHAN to the window which overlooks the city
EXT PRAGUE - DAY

ETHANs POV of Embassy

INT SAFE HOUSE - DAY

ETHAN nods

PHELPS (CONTD)
Beyond Charles Bridge there is our
Embassy See it Tomorrow night if
anything goes wrong this guy will steal
the names of our agents in every country

the highest bidders -- third world
terrorists arms dealers drug lords --
any and everybody whod love to get rid
of long term coverts like us and some
very dear friends among them If theyre
exposed theyll be executed Come over
here Take a lock at this

CLAIRE who is working at a computer has pulled up a
quicktime video image in a box on her screen In it an old
edition of the McLaughlin Report the PBS news show is

playing
ETHAN is distracted by it
INSERT - TELEVISION

SENATOR WALTZER a bearded bespectacled man in his forties
is holding forth
SENATOR WALTZER
Ill go you one further I say the CIA
and all its shadow organizations have
become irrelevant at best and
unconstitutional at worst Its time we
throw a little light on the whole concept

of the Pentagons black budget These
covert agency subgroups have confidential
funding they report to no one -- who are

these people We were living in a
democracy the last time I checked

BACK TO SCENE

ETHAN looks back at JIM

JACK comes

ETHAN

at the Oughterard Slough in County
Kildare with one of our best Irish guides

ETHAN
He wont be back in a hurry

PHELPS
No not in a hurry What do you think

ETHAN
Sure If the main character does

PHELPS
If you were me Ethan who would you
trust to make him believable

breezing in with a piece of bubble gum

JACK
Sorry am I interrupting

ETHAN

JACK shows the gum to ETHAN

JACK
Stick of gum If you come up against a
lock you cant pick --

Half the gum is red the other half is green

JACK (CONTD)

He offers the gum to ETHAN

PHELPS

CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHANs eye
PHELPS may have caught the glance but is focused on ETHAN

ETHAN
(relenting)
Give me the God damn gum

JACK
Just dont chew it

PHELPS
Thank you

EXT AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River Party
at the Embassy tonight

INT AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking
eyeglasses (theyre called Visco glasses) enters an elevator
shaft through a small door at the base of the wall He looks
up the shaft shining a flashlight until he finds what hes
looking for --

-- a gray metal box protruding from the wall one floor up
INT SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment watching
the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier The
monitors are alive now showing various views of the inside
of the Embassy where the party is going on and one view of
the elevator shaft

PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece

PHELPS
Ethan Jacks inside Windows open by
twenty-three hundred

INT EMBASSY - NIGHT

Inside the Embassy the party is a formal tuxedoed affair
thats in full swing on the second floor

SENATOR WALTZER the man who was on TV walks up a grand
staircase headed in An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo
hurries up to him

DIPLOMAT
How do you do Senator Im Rand Housman
the Ambassadors aide If I could just
steer you through the reception line here

The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm guiding him to a
reception line at the base of the stairs to the party

DIPLOMAT (CONTD)
Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid the
director of the National Gallery -- Petr
Brandl the mayor of Prague --

SARAH a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant
gown steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with
WALTZER

SARAH
I bet you dont remember me do you Senator

SENATOR WALTZER
Of course I do How are you Miss
Norman

He leans in and kisses her on the cheek and as he does so
SARAH whispers something in his ear

SARAH
Hes in pocket Under the archway behind me

Her tone her words -- we realize shes on the team
The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket
(and if we didnt know the SENATOR was ETHAN before this
confirms it) puts them on and looks up over her shoulder

UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE

ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN the Ukrainian has just come in from
outside

INT SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

PHELPS sees the SENATORs point of view of GOLITSYN through
the glasses broadcast back to PHELPS monitor He speaks
into his microphone

PHELPS
Sarah mark the package and go to two

INT EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
SARAH still has the SENATORs attention

SARAH
Your advance team mentioned youd want a
tour of the facility so Ive gone ahead
and set that up for you --

SENATOR WALTZER
Terrific Lets get going
(to the Diplomat)
Will you excuse us

He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off not into the
party but the other way toward a staircase that leads
further into the Embassy

DIPLOMAT
Uh sir

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK climbs up the elevator shaft towards the gray metal
box He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a
noise from above He looks up and sees the elevator above
him descending

JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall The
elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops pinning him
to the wall

JACK
Great Come on
INT EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN
SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse But as
she sprays she points it slightly to the left missing
herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYNS head He never
notices They move on and down the flight of stairs

INT SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party He looks
to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party a jumpy
one as someone hurrying up stairs

PHELPS
Hannah Hes marked Lets go

INT EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

On a flight of stairs HANNAH dressed for the party and
slightly out of breath hurries up the stairs

HANNAH
En route

She also has a pair of Visco glasses which she trains on the
party below She pushes a micro switch on the side of her
glasses activating an electronic filter which tints the
lenses

PHELPS (0S)
Hannah pull the shade (or - Hannah go to
night vision)

HANNAHiS VISCO POV

the party looks the same but one head in the crowd stands
out That head is GOLITSYNS his hair a fluorescent green
where SARAH sprayed it

INT THE DENIED AREAELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

The SENATOR (lets just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down
the stairs and pass a sign that says Denied Area --
Political Attaches Only ETHAN checks his watch 2300
He nods to SARAH they round a corner and come to an
elevator at the end of the corridor A sign in front of it

says Out of Order They head for it anyway

A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door catching them
by surprise

JACK
Governors in position We have the elevator

GUARD
Excuse me can I help you

SARAH
-- which leads directly to the Denied
Area the only limited access area in the
whole facility

SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking

SARAH (CONTD)
As you can see this area has both a
Marine guard and video surveillance and
is strictly monitored at all times

She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank
and slides her thumb inside The panel lights up and flashes
a message -- ACCESS DENIED SARAH and ETHAN trade a look

SARAH (CONTD)
(covering)
Senator dont you have a young man on
your staff named JACK

She tries the thumb again Still no soap

ETHAN
Jack I believe we did have a young man
named Jack Not a reliable man as I
recall Constantly late or behind in his
work

Now the GUARD noticing that Sarahs not being allowed
access comes closer to them

GUARD
Excuse me let me see that ID again

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator listening
to their conversation

PHELPS (0S)
Jacks pinned down Sarah Should be a
second Keep dancing
ETHAN (0S)
(with the Senators southern accent)
We were forced to tie him to my best
stallion and drag him around the barn a
few times

Finally the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed
JACK
Relax your crack Foghorn Im workin on
it
He quickly opens the gray metal box revealing a maze of
circuitry He patches in his computer climbs on top of the

elevator and hits the keyboard beginning to download

THE LAPTOP

theres a split-screen of SARAHs thumbprint and the ID
picture JACK downloads her file into the security computer

INT THE DENIED AREAELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
Ignoring the GUARD SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the
thumbprint analyzer once more The panel glows this time
the message flashes --

IDENTITY CONFIRMED
-- and the elevator doors slide open briskly

The GUARD surprised now catches sight of the SENATOR

GUARD
Oh Sorry sir

He snaps a salute ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and
the doors close behind them

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

JACK looks down at the elevator below Through a grating he
can see them inside

JACK

PHELPS (0S)
No damn it no I said ABORT

EXT EMBASSY - NIGHT
Outside the Embassy SARAH and ETHAN argue
ETHAN

Sarah eye on the package Jim Iim

SARAH

ETHAN
No weire going to recover the disk

ETHAN takes off for the bridge leaving SARAH to shadow
GOLITSYN

EXT PARKING AREA - NIGHT

HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs

PHELPS (0S)
Where are you

ETHAN
About two hundred yards from the bridge

PHELPS (0S)
Theyire covering this frequency Ethan
Cut all radio communications Repeat
Cut all radio communications

ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge Past
CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car He looks on his monitor
and again sees PHELPSi POV Only ominous silence Phelps is
looking back over his shoulder The bridge is deserted

EXT EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore where
a cobblestone promenade runs along the river He disappears
into the fog at the edge of the river
EXT STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

ETHAN checks his monitor again

THE MONITOR

PHELPSi point of view changes radically as his head swivels
on the darkened bridge He whirls again looking over his
shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible
pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor

The point of view goes crazy for a moment then over and down
to a bloody hole in his own chest

His head rocks again then goes over the side of the bridge
and makes the long hard fall into the river below

EXT STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT
ETHANis face goes white with shock

ETHAN
JIM

EXT CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereis
no sign of PHELPS

ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
sees only dark choppy waters below now becoming
obscured in the gathering fog

He turns and looks to the embankment He can faintly see
GOLITSYN hurrying along the promenade ETHAN gives chase

EXT PARKING AREA - NIGHT
ETHAN runs towards the getaway car reaching a vantage point

on the top of the stairs he can see CLAIREiS outline
visible in the driveris seat But as he descends the stairs

--the car explodes and bursts into flames

The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back

ETHAN
CLAIRE
He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment a
stunned CROWD starts to gather

Remembering SARAH he rushes down the stairs towards the
embankment

EXT EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
GOLITSYN again slowing down A MAN comes out of the fog an
seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light

SARAH draws closer Behind her the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
be hanging with her for some reason

EXT STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT
ETHAN continues towards the embankment
EXT EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN Suddenly the MAN in front of
GOLITSYN pulls him towards him Sensing something wrong
SARAH quickens her pace The MAN is now hunched over
GOLITSYN facing away from SARAH going through GOLITSYNis
pockets

The figure finds what itis looking for -- the disk -- and
takes it SARAH comes closer --

-- and the figure whirls It brings a knife up sharply
plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight

ANGLE

ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment He bursts
out of the fog just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees

over GOLITSYNis body ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
GASPS

He pulls the knife out of SARAH who is close to death He
looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
edge

BEHIND ETHAN

The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more In fact theyire
watching ETHAN Through the fog and night they see him
leaning over SARAH holding the knife in his hands

AT THE BODIES
SARAH goes still ETHAN lays her down turns the other body
over and sees that it is GOLITSYN He quickly begins
rummaging through his pockets

ETHAN hear police sirens and sees
ANGLE

A Prague police boat SIREN wailing arrives at the dock in
front of the Embassy The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
suddenly

As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
explosion ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
and out of sight

EXT STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver Heis
holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it a
modernist cockroach He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
of the phoneis wiring piercing it with its little prongs

He screws the mouthpiece back on holds the phoneis tongue
down for a second releases it and listens He has a dial
tone Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
heart

After a moment a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side

FLAT VOICE (0S)

KITTRIDGE (0S)

He hangs up ETHAN does the same He stares at the phone
for a moment thinking He checks his watch

EXT STREET - NIGHT

ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
street Every face seems to be starring at him now every
sound is menacing He pulls his coat in tight shoves his
hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd

EXT OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock a towering
gothic structure and into a plaza surrounded mostly by
residential buildings

ETHANiS POV

Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
on the portico of an old palace

Brilliantly lit up from inside the restaurant positively
shimmers every table visible from everywhere in the plaza

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
ETHANS POV

ETHAN walks in the glass front doors right next to an
enormous fish tank part of the restaurants exterior wall
He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are
scattered around

EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle He and
ETHAN make eye contact ETHAN walks to the table a couple
of quick seemingly cursory glances around the room as he
goes KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized
lobster He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit
KITTRIDGE
I cant tell you how sorry I am

I know

how much Jim in particular meant to you

Ethan Personally as well as professionally

ETHAN
Yeah

He spots a stack of documents on the table

ETHAN picks them up

ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette
drivers license etc

KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing

carefully

KITTRIDGE

Theres a Canadian picture bearing

credit cards

Passport visas - you know the drill
Well work the exfiltration thru Canada
debrief you at Langley Throw the Prague
police a bone you know toss them a few

suspects Follow me

ETHAN
Yeah I follow you

KITTRIDGE

Weve lost enough agents for one night

ETHAN

You mean Ive lost enough agents for one

night

KITTRIDGE

You seem hell bent on blaming yourself

Ethan

ETHAN
Who else is left

KITTRIDGE
Yes I see your point

ETHAN
Why was there another team

KITTRIDGE
What

ETHAN
Of IMF agents At the Embassy

Tonight

then
KITTRIDGE
dont quite follow you

ETHAN

Lets see if you can follow me around
this room

(eyes moving around the room)

The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7
and 8 oclockThe couple waltzing
around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11

The waiter behind Hannah at the top of
the staircase - Bowtie 12 oclock The
other IMF team Youre worried about me
Why

KITTRIDGE
(a tight little smile)
Youre right Maybe thisll save some
time

The figures around the room have grown restless KITTRIDGE
tries to indicate that its okay He pulls some papers out
of his jacket

KITTRIDGE (CONTD)
For a little over two years now weve
been spotting serious blowback in IMF
operations We have a penetration The
other day we decoded a message on the
nternet from a Czech we know as Max

ETHAN
he arms dealer

KITTRIDGE

Thats right Max it seems has two
unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents
This time hes gotten to someone on the
inside - hes put himself in a position
to buy our NOC list An operation he
referred to as Job 314 The job he
thought Golitsyn was doing tonight

ETHAN
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy

KITTRIDGE
Correct the actual list is safe at
Langley Golitsyn was a lightning rod

one of ours
ETHAN
This whole operation was a molehunt

KITTRIDGE
Yes the moles deep inside And -- like
you said You survived

ETHAN stares at him levelly

KITTRIDGE (CONTD)
I want to show you something Ethan

He now shoves the papers across the table Theyre xeroxed
copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and
MARGARET ETHAN HUNT It shows a balance of 127 000

KITTRIDGE (CONTD)
Since your fathers death your familys
farm has been in sub-chapter S and now
suddenly theyre flush with over a
hundred and twenty grand in the bank
Dads illness was supposed to have wiped
out the bank account -- dying slowly in
America after all can be a very
expensive proposition Ethan So why
dont we go quietly out of here onto the
plane

ETHAN
How about if we just go quietly into the
bathroom and I wash your mouth out with
soap - you pathetic button down
bureaucratic asshole

KITTRIDGE (CONTD)
Ethan I can understand youre very

upset

ETHAN
Kitteridge youve never seen me very
upset

ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket While
KITTRIDGE talks ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand

KITTRIDGE
All right enough is enough Hunt Youve
bribed cajoled killed - and relied on
intimate loyalties to get away with it
Youre determined to shake hands with the
devil and Im going to make sure you do
it in hell
We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- its the piece of
bubble gum half red half green He squeezes the gum
mushing the two sides together
ETHAN lashes out swatting KITTRIDGES glass of wine off the
table in one quick motion As he does he hurls the piece of

gum

Diners look up startled at the sound of the breaking wine
glass KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass --

-- and sees the piece of gum stuck to the tank His eyes
widen KA BOOM

The tiny piece of plastique explodes SHATTERING the fish
tank A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and
WOMAN knocking them to the ground

At the same time ETHAN bolts for the door

EXT OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off into the
deserted square

EXT SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Silence ETHAN enters the darkened entry

INT SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

ETHAN glances up at the stairwell Naked light bulbs
illuminate the way up He slips off his jacket and shirt
then puts his jacket back on

INT SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

ETHAN unscrews a bulb He crushes the bulb in his shirt and
scatters the glass fragments on the steps He climbs to the
next bulb

INT SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT

At the now-darkened door to the apartment theres the soft
sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth glass fragments
dropping and ETHANS at the door

INT SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

In the darkened safe house ETHAN goes to a vase with
flowers picks it up and unscrews the bottom retrieving a
Sig Sauer automatic He moves through the rooms checking
them as he goes

INT SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

ETHAN checks the shower then goes to his shaving kit
pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can He
unscrews the bottoms retrieving cash in various
denominations from various countries and a couple of
passports

As he pockets them he catches sight of himself in the
mirror Hes a mess He splashes water on his face

INT SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water
and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst

INT SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

He comes back into the living room Still drinking he
notices flickering lights on the other side of the room the
static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching One by
one he switches them off

THE LAPTOP

wakes it up

The computer emits a DIAL TONE then STATIC as it hits its

A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other
side of the room PHELPS staggers toward him wet and muddy
his middle a hopelessly bloody mess He looks like hes
dying on his feet ETHAN freezes appalled

He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her half-
spinning her around The coat hits the floor like a dead
body CLAIRES instinctive move is to cover her chest

CLAIRE begins to shiver ETHAN circles her runs his hand
cursorily across her body It accentuates CLAIRES
shivering

releases his grip on her wrists

INT SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

ETHAN sits in front of the computer staring blankly at it
still waiting for a response CLAIRE sitting on the end of
the bed Dawn approaches its very very quiet

CLAIRE
Why havent they brought us in yet

ETHAN
Ive been disavowed They think I killed
Jim and everyone else Somehow a hundred
thousand dollars found its way into my
parents bank account Kittridge assumes

A long moment while she stares at ETHANs back

CLAIRE
What are you going to do

ETHAN
Im going to get it for him Whoever the
mole is I think goes by the name of Job
at least part of the time 1 cant find
him but if he knows 1 have the NOC list

CLAIRE
Ethan youre not making sense Let me
go in and talk to Kittridge Im going
to tell him you had nothing to do

ETHAN

The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it

on the message box The screen blinks and the message shows

CLAIRE looks to ETHAN

CLAIRE
The message is for Job

ETHAN
Im going to answer it

EXT STREET BY BANKFLORENC BUS STOP - DAY
ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade A
MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench his back to
ETHAN

ETHAN
Excuse me could I trouble you for a
match

Without turning the MAN offers up a box of matches As
ETHAN takes them TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm
and escort him into a car which has just pulled up

INT CAR - DAY

ETHAN slides into the back seat between the TWO MEN
MATTHIAS the man on the left holds up a black hood He
extends it to ETHAN who doesnt take it

MATTHIAS
Would you remove your hat please

ETHAN
Why

MATTHIAS
You wish to meet Max This is the price
of admission

Reluctantly Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car
takes off

INT MAXS APARTMENT - DAY

The black hood still on his head ETHAN has trouble sitting
upright Hes before a desk in an apartment somewhere in
the city -- its impossible to tell where as the blinds are
drawn The place is roomy and lavishly furnished --
expensive Oriental rugs well-chosen objects of art

Somewhere down the block a dog BARKS steadily every few
seconds In the hallway outside the apartment door someone
is VACUUMING MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby

ETHAN
I thought I was going to see Max

MATTHIAS
You misunderstood No one sees Max

ETHAN
Then what am I doing here
MATTHIAS
Allowing Max to see you and hear what
youve got to say

ETHAN
I dont communicate very well through a
shroud

MATTHIAS

If Max doesnt like what you have to say
youll be wearing that shroud
indefinitely

ETHAN
Im willing to take the chance

MATTHIAS
Very well

MAXS figure into frame MATTHIAS removes ETHANs hood
When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall
woman of indeterminate age Shes handsome to the point of
severity

MAX
Who are you and what are you doing here

ETHAN
I need one hundred thousand dollars

MAX
Really And you thought if you simply
showed up I might give it to you

ETHAN

Why not You gave Job a hundred and
twenty five thousand

MAX
The penny drops You are not Job Yes
Job is not given to quoting Scripture in
his communications And there was its

tone -- aggressive but playful Job is
not playful So youre something of a
paradox

ETHAN

That depends

MAX
On what
ETHAN
Whether you like a paradox I want a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars

MAX
Its quite out of the question

ETHAN
The disk Job sold you is worthless Its
bait part of an internal molehunt

MAX
And how might you know that Are you
another Company man

ETHAN
Like Job

MAX
Ah but were asking about you

ETHAN
Im NOC Was Now disavowed

MAX
Why may I ask

ETHAN
Thats the question I want to ask Job

MAX
I dont know Job any more than he knows
me

ETHAN
Even so Im sure you could arrange an
introduction

MAX
Why should I

ETHAN
Because I can deliver the actual NOC
list The one you have is not only
worthless its certain to be equipped
with a homing device to pinpoint your
exact location

MAX
Its easy to say the disk is worthless
when you say I cant look at the
information and see if its worthless
Not a tenable position sir

ETHAN
Okay boot it up and in anywhere from
thirty seconds to ten minutes youre
gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping
around you like jackrabbits

MAX
(Pause)
Mm - Hmmm

ETHAN
Tell you what How goods the RF scanner
you used in the car

MAX
Very good

ETHAN
Okay use it But I suggest pack up
first

ANGLE

MATTHIAS boots up Theres a little musical noise and the
screen brightens The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a
complex list of names addresses phone numbers and other
personal information scrolls by But Matthias is watching
the digital read-out on the RF scanner

MATTHIAS
Twenty-six twenty-seven So far so
good

MAX

Thats not so good for you my friend
On the scanner the digital read-out is now in the thirties

MATTHIAS
Thirty-two and change

MAX
(to Ethan)
Doesnt mean its a signal Could just
be the hard drive heating up

She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if shes trying to
make up her mind about something
MATTHIAS
Forty-four Forty-five

ETHAN
Luther I guess youre all out of
excuses

LUTHER

I cant just hack my way inside Theres
no modem access to the mainframe its in
a stand-alone Id have to be physically
at the terminal

ETHAN
Luther relax its worse than you think
The terminals in black vault lock-down

INT CIA CORRIDORGUARD STATION - DAY
While ETHAN talks we see what hes referring to

A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file
folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters
building He comes to an impressive guard station and rests
his chin on a strange-looking optometric device

ETHAN (VO)
They missed nothing in that room Even
the vents have laser nets over them

Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into
a RESTRICTED area of the building

INT CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

The ANALYST reaches a curtained area He shoves the curtain
aside and comes to a large vaulted door He slides a card-
key into a slot leaves it there and slides a second card-key
into the slot beneath it

ETHAN (VO)
Inside there are three countermeasure
systems that can only be deactivated by
authorized entry Which we wont have

A panel next to the ANALYST says INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES
OFF The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code
CHUNKS the door open and steps into --

INT CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
-- the secured terminal room Its not large but its
impressive A single terminal is bolted into the middle of
the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook
computer storage towers

ETHAN (VO)
The first system is sound-sensitive
anything above a whisper sets it off
The second system is on the floor and
pressure-sensitive --

The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across
the room As he walks the floor tiles light up under his
feet turning off again when he lifts the weight from them

ETHAN (VO)
--and the third detects any increase in
temperature Even the body heat of an
unauthorized person in the room will
trigger it

A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72
degrees The ANALYST sets his glass down boots up the
computer and starts entering data from the file folders

ETHAN (VO)
All three systems are state of the art

The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea A drop of
condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor When it
makes contact the floor panel lights up

INT TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT

The other team members gathered around the table look at
ETHAN skeptically

LUTHER
And you really think we can do this

INT TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The middle of the night and the train is dark The team
members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER
heads in one direction ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other

ETHAN stops His attention is drawn to the car ahead There
is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it

ETHANS POV THRU WINDOW (INT BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)
Ethan sees the business car a plush space for busy
executives to get some work done on the train There are
laptops cellular phones desks that fold out in front of
spacious seats

A FEMALE EXECUTIVE forty or so is seated at one of the
desks typing away into her laptop

INT TRAIN - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
ETHAN knocks on the compartment door

ETHAN
May I come in

CLAIRE
(wary but interested)
Sure

INT TRAIN - CLAIREiS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

ETHAN and CLAIRE enter ETHAN closing the compartment door
He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her
She takes it waits

ETHAN
Its cash And a second passport If
anything goes wrong when were inside if
you sense even the slightest deviation
dont look over your shoulder you walk
away - you hear me Just walk away

CLAIRE
You dont think were going to make it

ETHAN
I didnt say that

CLAIRE
You didnt have to

ETHAN
I just need you to be safe

CLAIRE
What about you

ETHAN
What about me - Jim called an abort - I
didnt comply I lost the team I just
need you to be safe
CLAIREs coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to
take it in

CLAIRE
I wish Id never laid eyes on you

And theyre suddenly violently in each others arms kissing
and half-falling onto the converted bed She suddenly
resists He senses it and pulls away

ETHAN
Sorry

He rises and goes to the door Hes got his hand on the knob
when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind turns him
to her and kisses him deeply This time they sink slowly to
the bed

She sees a MAN sitting alone reading a newspaper Its the

sits next to him

He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile then
goes back to his paper

He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing

perfume sampler She dumps the clear liquid contents into
his coffee He turns back and hands her part of the paper
CLAIRE smiles

The GUARD moves towards ETHAN who kicks back at him pushing
him back to KRIEGER who zaps the GUARD on the back of the
neck He twitches and slumps to the ground unconscious
KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck

ETHAN turns Holding the GUARDS head with one hand KRIEGER
pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with
the other He jabs it toward the base of the GUARDS skull -

arm shoving it up against the wall Staring into KRIEGERS
face in warning

The first climb is straight up KRIEGER cups his hands under
ETHANS foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to
climb

ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts moving
horizontally now They reach a juncture and turn right

INT DUCT - DAY

ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct A
laser net protects the ventilator red shafts of light cris-
crossing every which way ETHAN looks down through the net

He can see the computer room below and the top of the
TECHNICIANS head

INT DUCT - DAY

In the duct ETHAN signals to KRIEGER making a triangle of
his hands KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi-
sided pyramid shaped glass object

ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of
the laser nets beams The pyramid glows and we realise what
it is -- a prism

The laser beam now captive in the prism ETHAN carefully
moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and
directs it toward another prism clearing a path through the
shaft

INT CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

Up in the ceiling above it one of the screws starts to move
in the ventilator shaft unscrewing When it appears ready
to drop out a thin strip of metal snakes out from between
the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw

The screw drops out of its hole but it doesnt drop to the
floor it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip
with a gentle CLICK as to a magnet
The screw is pulled up through the shaft Now the whole
shaft moves down into the room held by a hand

It turns sideways and is pulled up into the duct

A rubber tube snakes down through the hole coming to a stop
near the thermostat which says its seventy-two degrees A
gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the
tube cooling the room

INT CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the
terminal room

INT CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw
earlier No-one is there theres not a sound but for the
gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use

Now ETHANs head descends slowly into the room his hair
falling in front of him

At first it seems hes just poking his head in for a look
but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head then
shoulders then waist then knees and finally we see his
ankles and understand

He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and
temperature read out on the computer Suddenly ETHAN is
lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the
computer as the ANALYST enters the room

INT CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down a stack
of work to his right

INT CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer He pauses
and wipes some sweat from his forehead

INT CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

With a strange look on his face the TECHNICIAN looks up
Its almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead --

TECHNICIAN
Oh God
-- he vomits

He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again Puzzled
sick and feeling another wave coming on he drags himself to
his feet hauls himself across the room and leaves

INT CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

Even sick the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the
alarm systems with a card-key They HUM back to life
efficiently a light flashing

INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON
INT CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

ETHAN descends again slowly but steadily until he is at the
same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in
front of the computer

A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together secured by a
rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the
set of pulleys
INT DUCT - DAY

KRIEGER holds the rope his jaw clenched sweat breaking out
on his forehead

Unfortunately hes three feet away from it He stretches
his arms but cant reach

He blinks unable to believe this He curls himself into a
situp and looks up into the shaft

INT DUCT - DAY

KRIEGER sees the predicament

INT CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

ETHAN gestures to him pointing to the floor Slowly
KRIEGER drops him another few feet Now ETHANs lower than

the terminal and still three feet away from it

He closes his eyes summoning his strength and does another
situp bringing himself up right in front of the terminal

INT FIRE TRUCK - DAY
In the fire truck LUTHER who is watching on the Visco
monitor turns his head upside down to get a look at what
ETHAN sees

He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and
begins to whisper We hear only the moist airy sound of his
breath not the words

out to the upside down keyboard cranes his head to see it
and starts typing softly

The computer HUMS activated ETHAN unbuttons his pocket
withdraws a 35 disk and slides it gently into the floppy
drive

The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR ETHAN winces even
that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances

But no alarms go off

into the microphone

INT CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The 35 disk is ejected from the floppy drive ETHAN pockets
it and signals to be raised

Slowly his body starts to move up As it does a bead of
sweat rolls down his nose balling at the tip

ETHAN ignores it But below him he sees the floor tiles
four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the
computer terminal

His eyes widen as he realizes something --

--the drop of sweat falls --

--and he catches it with his right hand

While he talks he rotates his hand palm away from KRIEGER
When he rotates it back the disk is gone again He holds up
his left hand Its there now

looks at her He turns completely red When he looks back
at ETHAN ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand

picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off
carefully

He replaces it in the trash with the blue disk from his
jacket pocket

LUTHER

ETHAN
Now I want you to hold onto it

news crews charge up to him

REPORTER
Mr Fairchild agent Fairchild a comment
please

The image on the television changes to an interview with a
PUBLIC OFFICIAL who faces a bank of microphones

PUBLIC OFFICIAL
I think its sad really Farmers
unless theyre a conglomerate are always
operating on a paper-thin margin Im
afraid what we have here is a case of a
naive and lonely widow with a lot of
financial problems who chose to make
money through illegal means

REPORTER
That was John Fairchild the DEA agent in
charge of this investigation Officials
tell me that international law
enforcement agents are expected to arrive
here later today to question the Hunts
This is Joe Jones CNN Love in Madison

eliminated completely from their files

TECHNICIAN who says

BARNES

Surprisingly KITTRIDGE is not as upset as he is puzzled

KITTRIDGE
He wanted us to know he was in London

Clearly thats the question that KITTRIDGE is turning over in
his mind and he doesnt have a simple answer to it

EXT PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT
Close Digital clock It reads 2359 Angle widens to show
ETHAN looking at it with grim satisfaction He opens the
door of the phone booth and almost SMACKS right into --
--the pale weary ghostlike figure of a man standing just
inches in front of him Startled ETHAN looks up but what
he sees shakes him to the core

The man is JIM PHELPS

ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth
PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly
PHELPS
Youre a hard man to catch up with

PHELPS falls towards ETHAN ETHAN tries to speak but cant
even form words

INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY)

ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth PHELPS
looking clammy and listing to one side But the banter
seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close
colleagues able to follow one anothers reasoning easily
finishing each others sentences

PHELPS
the next day I managed to drag myself
to the safe house mustve just missed
youanyway I checked our aliases

ETHAN
- and picked us up in the States -

PHELPS
- but you left before I could get there
and I could check just so many places

ETHAN
Yeah smaller countries dont computerize

PHELPS
- so I watched Europe Once you showed
up in Englandit was easy

ETHAN
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool
Street

PHELPS

Hey I showed em to you

ETHAN

PHELPS smiles warmly has to steady himself to maintain an
upright position He opens a medicine bottle and takes the
pain killers

ETHAN
Jim who do you think youre kidding A
doctors gotta look at that You cant
sit up straight
PHELPS
I can sit up straight I just cantsit

and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually
happened

ETHAN VO
- first he took care of Jack in the
elevator -

At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the
building watching it go and crush Kiefer

ETHAN VO
- he shot you on the bridge -

On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the
gun toward them fires cants the glasses and tosses them
into the Vltava River

ETHAN VO

Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence

There on the embankment in the night and fog it is KRIEGER
who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence

How did he do Hannah

Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the
detonator and turns dreamily to face it the explosion
brilliant behind her

ETHAN VO
No No He couldve taken out Hannah
himself

PHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows
OVER SHOULDER - PHELPS (INT RAILWAY CAFE)

ETHAN

Awkward moment

PHELPS

over this threatens to overwhelm him Then controlling it

much at stake Ethan

ETHAN

The door to CLAIRES room in the safe house opens throwing a

out a small package with for Job written on it

KITTRIDGE looks at him He rips it open A note inside
simply says

KITTRIDGE looks at his watch Itis ten to twelve

As he reads the note something else falls out of the

the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the
computer in the briefcase He boots it up quickly and turns
the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to
see

One half of the screen with the heading CRYPTONYM AND
OPERATIONAL SPECS is already jammed with information The
blank second half of the screen acquires the title TRUE

INT REAR CAR - ENGINEERS SECTION - DAY

PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over
the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS
PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles reaches a trap door
and climbs through it --

EXT ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

-- halfway out onto the roof of the train He reaches into
his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle
on the end of it He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof
and pulls himself the rest of the way out

He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the
smooth surface of the train

Now for the tough part Using the suction cups PHELPS
slowly pulls himself forward a foot at a time pulling and
replanting the cups as he goes

He drags himself over the length of the final car to the
back of the train where the rear engine slants off sharply
a window for the ENGINEER

Half kneeling on the roof PHELPS pulls out the clip from his
belt

He looks up scanning the sky behind the train From out
of the fog a helicopter approaches
PHELPS turns and looks ahead in the direction the train is
going In the distance he can see the chunnel approaching
the tunnel under the English Channel His eyes widen

INT HELICOPTER - DAY

KRIEGER is at the controls He sees the approaching tunnel
as well

EXT ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position Looking up he
sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him PHELPS turns

ETHAN is climbing out the trap door

A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter almost
touching the roof of the train PHELPS crawls closer to it

ETHAN behind him is in a far more precarious position
Without goggles or suction cups he has to use his fingers to

grab small holes on the roof

He is flipped over by the wind ending up facing the other
way Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof

INT HELICOPTER - DAY

KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching He gestures
to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him passing
over PHELPS and then back to him

EXT ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto
his belt ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the
roof

ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto
the roof

PHELPS and ETHAN struggle but they are hurtling dangerously
closer to the chunnel entrance

Theyre now right on top of the chunnel entrance
INT HELICOPTER - DAY

KRIEGER sees the tunnel only seconds away now He paws at
the controls jerking back desperately on a certain lever

EXT ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the
train PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the
strap manages to pull himself back on

-- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel --

-- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT

INT BUSINESS CARTUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

As the train roars into the tunnel the business car goes
nearly dark and the message on MAXS computer screen changes

one last time This time it says

CONNECTION TERMINATED
TRANSFER LOST

MAXS face falls

Damn
INT REAR CARENGINEERS SECTION - DAY

Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car past his inert
companion and is shocked to see the copter right behind the
train He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it

CONDUCTOR
No no its IN the tunnel

VOICE (0S)
Stop the train

CONDUCTOR
Itll crash into us Accelerate
accelerate

EXT ROOF OF TRAINTUNNEL - DAY
For a moment we see no one No ETHAN No PHELPS Moving
around to the other end of the car we see where theyve

gone

Theyre dangling from either side of it

PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself
back onto the roof of the train ETHAN reaches for the other
cup

The helicopter fortunate that this tunnel is double track
and barely wide enough to accomodate it pursues KRIEGER
pushing it up to full speed again

But it cant lift up high enough to go completely over the
train

EXT ROOF OF TRAINTUNNEL - DAY

PHELPS nearing the back manoeuvers himself to the
windshield of the rear power car trying to grab the skid of
KRIEGERS copter

He doesnt see whats headed toward him coming from the
other direction

Another train

At the last moment PHELPS notices the reflection of the
oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the
roof of his train barely avoiding getting creamed by it as
it blows by

The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS
misses the skid

KRIEGER tips the front of the copter trying to decapitate
ETHAN with the rotor PHELPS jumps onto the skid but the
copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the
tunnel SPARKS and chunks of cement fly

KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly ETHAN uses the moment to
leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid

PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids facing one another
Crouching on the skid ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls

out --

-- a red and green piece of bubble gum

PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER who scrambles
frantically for his gun

ETHAN
Red light green light Asta Lasagna

mother fucker

ETHAN mashes the red into the green slaps the gum onto the
copters underbelly and turns away from it

PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum SCREAMING --

-- but the gum EXPLODES The force of the blast rockets
ETHAN forward he lands on the trains windshield

The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel veers
wildly then pitches forward and down smashing PHELPS under
the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball

ETHAN stuck on the windshield can only watch as the
wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him
It stops just short of him with its bent and broken rotor
blade barely missing his throat

ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass utterly
drained

wait for her to speak

When she finally does shes almost charming

EXT LONDON PUB - DAY

LUTHER sits on a high stool his PowerBook next to him while
he sips a beer A television screen is featuring follow-up
coverage of yesterdays dramatic helicopter-train wreck in
the chunnel Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of
a lone crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in
the crash there are comments about how miraculous it was
there were no other fatalaties There are intermittent
sounds of aircraft taking off and landing announcements of
arrivals and departures ETHAN into shot He sits beside
LUTHER

LUTHER

Reach your folks
(ETHAN nods)

How they feeling

ETHAN
About what

LUTHER

The official apology from the Justice
Department the VIP treatment you know
the whole nine yards

ETHAN

Cheers

ETHAN
Heres to you Luther (clink glasses) To

being off the disavowed list

Youre more than that Luther They were
mistaken about you and theyre trying to
show you they know it They want you
back in

LUTHER
Sure They want me back in so I wont
break in They still cant figure out
how we did it

ETHAN
You didnt tell em at the debriefing

LUTHER
I figured Id let em reinstate my back
pay give me a promotion check out my
office at Langley and then maybe talk
about it

ETHAN
(laughing)
Its all one big negotiation isnt it

LUTHER
Why dont you come back with me

ETHAN

LUTHER
You really liked Phelps didnt you

ETHAN
He was a good guy for a long long time
Just - not long enough (looks up) Gotta
catch my flight (rising)
So Hows it feel being a solid citizen
again

LUTHER
Oh manI dont know Im gonna miss
being disreputable

ETHAN
Well Luther - if it makes you feel any
better Ill always think of you that way

The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no
more The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and ina
moment ETHAN disappears from the bar leaving a contemplative
LUTHER looking after him
