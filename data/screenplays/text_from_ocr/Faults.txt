INT HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY 1

It’s 1986

On ANSEL ROTH (40s) alone in a booth eating a club
sandwich He wears a blazer that’s a depressing shade of
brown and sports a mustache

A WAITER approaches

WAITER
Can I get you anything else

He chews and swallows then shakes his head “no”

WAITER (CONTD)
In that case Whenever you’re
ready

Before the waiter can set the check on the table Ansel pulls
a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and hands it to the
young man

ANSEL
I have a voucher

The waiter unfolds the paper He inspects it then

WAITER
I’1l be right back

He walks away from the table Ansel doesn’t look up as he
eats the remainder of the fries on his plate

A moment later the waiter returns with his MANAGER Ansel
looks up

ANSEL
That is a voucher from the hotel

MANAGER
Well Yes It is But this voucher
has been used already

ANSEL
No it hasn’t

The manager remains calm He holds the paper out for Ansel to
see

MANAGER
You see here These are my
initials I’m the manager
(MORE)
MANAGER (CONTD)
When the voucher has been used I
mark it with my initials and then
it’s processed

ANSEL
I was given that by the hotel

MANAGER
I understand but what I’m saying
is that you used it last night I
remember you It looks like you-
like someone tried to erase the
writing but it’s pen ink It’s
faded but still there

Ansel sits up

ANSEL
I am a guest of the hotel I was
promised one complimentary meal a
day while I’m staying here

MANAGER
That’s fine but I don’t know
anything about that You’re going
to want to talk with hotel
Management about that But this is
no good and I need you to pay for
your food

ANSEL
How much is it

MANAGER
Four seventy five--

ANSEL
(cutting him off)
I don’t have that

MANAGER
How much do you have

Ansel stuffs the remainder of his sandwich in his mouth It’s
too big a piece and hard to chew

ANSEL
(mouth full)
Nothing I don’t have anything

He continues to stare and chew antagonistic
Green 3

MANAGER
I’m going to have to ask you to
leave

ANSEL

Id like to finish my meal

MANAGER
And I’d like for you to leave
Plus you’ve eaten your food

Ansel’s plate is clean He scans the table He casually
reaches for the ketchup bottle turns it upside down and
gives it a few shakes onto his plate He eats a bite of
ketchup using his fork

MANAGER (CONTD)
Please stop that

He doesn’t The manager slides the plate away from him
Ansel reaches for the syrup dispenser but the manager steps
in and grabs him A struggle ensues in the confides of the
booth

The young waiter stays back unsure of what to do

The manager forces Ansel out of the booth DELAYED PAN as the

Manager pushes him towards the exit

INT HOTEL HALLWAYLOBBY - DAY - CONTINUOUS 2

Ansel is shoved through the doors and out of the
restaurant

MANAGER

I want you to know that I saw you
take that voucher out of the trash
I wasn’t going to say anything
about that because I didn’t want to
embarrass you but then all this
happened

(beat)
So I’m saying it RAKK

Ansel straightens his jacket and walks into the lobby of the
three star hotel as if nothing happened People stare for a
moment but quickly go back to their business

Ansel spots a fallen poster and stand He rights the stand
and puts the poster back in its place

On the poster is Ansel’s somewhat sad smiling face holding a
book called FOLLOWER INSIDE THE MIND OF THE CONTROLLED BY
ANSEL ROTH PHD

A HOTEL GUEST stops as she’s walking past She looks at the
poster then at Ansel Ansel stares back

HOTEL GUEST
You look familiar

ANSEL
(re the poster)
That is me

HOTEL GUEST
No from somewhere else

ANSEL
I don’t know you so I don’t know
how you would know me

Confused she walks away

CONCIERGE (0S)
Mr Roth

The CONCIERGE approaches He smiles professionally

CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
Only a few more hours until your
presentation Do you have
everything you need

ANSEL
My sign was on the ground

CONCIERGE
I’m sorry to hear that
Housekeeping was wondering at what
point they might expect your things
to be gathered so they can turn
over the room

ANSEL

Also why was my dinner only comped
last night I was under the
impression I would get one free
meal per day

(beat)
What time is check out tomorrow
morning I can be out by then
CONCIERGE
I think there’s been some sort of
misunderstanding

ANSEL

CONCIERGE
According to the agreed upon terms
for your speaking arrangement you
were entitled to a night’s stay and
one free meal at our restaurant
You used both last night

ANSEL
Terry is aware of this
CONCIERGE
I don’t know who Terry is
ANSEL
My manager The man who made the
deal
CONCIERGE

Terry agreed to the terms yes
Checkout should have been at noon
Can you be out of the room in the
next hour

Ansel stares at his poster

ANSEL
Can this wait until after the
seminar

CONCIERGE

No I’m sorry You can pay for
another room tonight though I can
give you a reduced employee rate
We accept Traveler’s checks or you
could always pay in cash

ANSEL
(shaking his head)

ANSEL

(lying)
Yes

INT HOTEL LOBBY - GUEST CHECK IN - DAY 3

The concierge presses 9 on the large phone and passes it to
Ansel who clearly dials enough digits to be a long distance
number The concierge shakes his head disappointingly but
does nothing about it and instead helps another guest

The phone rings It rings again And again before

ANSEL
Hello Terry Pick up

It’s me Ansel
(waits)
Roth-- Ansel Roth Can you pick up

Terry

A NEWLYWED COUPLE steps up to the counter next to Ansel The
RECEPTIONIST congratulates the happy pair

Ansel moves to the edge of the counter and turns his back to
them

ANSEL (CONTD)
Sorry I’m still here I guess

the seminar in

He leans over and interrupts the receptionist helping the
couple

ANSEL (CONTD)
What town is this

RECEPTIONIST

assisting these guests

She looks back at the couple and begins to speak

ANSEL
(interrupting to the
couple)

YOUNG MARRIED MAN

Ansel returns to the edge of the counter The receptionist
apologizes to the couple

KKK
ANSEL

(back into the phone)

seminar and I need to talk to you
Terry It’s about the deal and the

He hangs up the phone

INT ANSEL’S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY 4

Ansel pees into the toilet He finishes and reaches for the
lever to flush but decides not to He also decides to leave
the seat up

He removes the toilet paper from the dispenser He takes the

shampoo and soap from the shower as well as a towel anda
hand towel

INT ANSEL’S HOTEL ROOM - LIVING AREA - DAY 5

Ansel tosses the toiletries into his suitcase Half the

There’s a knock at the door

HOUSEKEEPING (0S)

opens the door to see a nice OLDER WOMAN with an accent

HOUSEKEEPING (CONT’D)

ANSEL (CONTD)

(feeling guilty)
Sorry One second
Blue 8

He goes into the bathroom and closes the lid and flushes the
toilet

He listens to the sound as he stares at himself in the
mirror

EXT HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY 6

Ansel totes his suitcase to a used late 70’s Chevy Chevette

He pops open the trunk to the hatchback revealing stacks of
boxes filled with copies of his book He places the suitcase
in the trunk and removes two of the boxes of books before
slamming the door shut

Ansel walks back towards the hotel with the boxes but
struggles to carry them

INT HOTEL - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY 7

The somewhat large space is brightly lit by the room’s
overhead fluorescents A small stage has been set up at the
head of the room flanked by the poster and stand from earlier
on one side and a table full of books on the other Very low
budget

Ansel stands on the stage in front of a hundred or so event
chairs though only a quarter of them are filled Despite the
small crowd and less than ideal setup he speaks with
conviction He he has every beat memorized

ANSEL
I’m talking about free will
Choice Decisions that are decided
upon by ourselves So were in
control right Yes No We make a
plan but life has other ideas
doesn’t it Making a choice for
yourself based on what life gives
you- That is free will
It’s like a sermon Ansel puts everything he has into it

ANSEL (CONT’D)
But what if someone else is in
control What if they control your
physical body Your minds every
thought Your emotional well being
Well ladies and gentlemen cults
do this They exploit the fact that
inside every single one of us is
the capacity to be captivated To
be manipulated Controlled They
exploit your weaknesses They hack
our consciousness and remove you
from those who care about you They
create physical and emotional
barriers distancing you from
everyone and everything you once
knew including yourself They
mold you Conform you Even with
that voice in the back of your head
screaming “Get out” most give in

A MOTHER in the audience gathers her young SON to leave The
child wears swim trunks and has a towel wrapped around his
shoulders having just been at the hotel pool

Ansel stops speaking for a moment He listens as the sound of
wet flip-flops SMACK the soles of the boy’s feet echoes
through the room

ANSEL (CONTD)
When another human being makes
decisions for you your free will
ceases to be

He watches as the kid follows his mother towards the door

ANSEL (CONTD)
Youre a follower

The son glances back at Ansel Ansel stares him down The boy
exits

ANSEL (CONT’D)
(back to business)
At that point you have become a
follower But you don’t have to be
You may ask “How do I escape this
imprisonment”

A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE laughs Ansel is caught off guard but
continues

ANSEL (CONT’D)
Well I’m going to talk with you
about that At this point I
encourage you to follow along in my
book For those who don’t have a
copy they can be purchased from me
at this time for fifteen dollars

The man makes a bigger fuss this time Audience members look
back at the man

ANSEL (CONTD)
(to the man)
Do you have a question

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
No I do not

Ansel redirects his attention back to the seminar

ANSEL
No one needs a book I see a lot of
you do not have the book--

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
(interrupting)
Fuck you

ANSEL
Me

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
You I’m talking to you

ANSEL
I’m not sure what you’re trying to
say

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Does it bother you that you cannot
control me

ANSEL
I encourage those with questions to
save them until the end

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Youre lying to these people You
stand there pretending to have the
answers
Green ANSEL
No I do not This all of this is
based on my years of experience and
research I am offering people a
path

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Who are you

ANSEL
Who are you

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Who are you

ANSEL
I’m Ansel Roth one of the world’s
foremost authorities on mind
control and cult organizations-—-—

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
You’re a murderer

The audience begins to rustle Whispers can be heard Ansel

stands there silent and motionless then

ANSEL
(realizing)
Who are you

The man walks towards the stage

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
You brainwashed my family into
thinking what they were doing was
right

ANSEL
It was

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
You and people who claimed to care
about her gang-raped her mind You
broke her You destroyed her

The man makes his way onto the stage and stands in front of

Ansel

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE (CONT’D)
Then you exploited her You
humiliated her for the world to
see

KKK

KKKK
Blue 12

ANSEL
She would be dead if-- I know she’s
not alive now but still she’d be
dead if she stayed with the group

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
She wouldn’t have died alone

There’s something in the way Ansel looks at the man Remorse

ANSEL
Your family knew they were losing
her We tried to help her You have
to see that Please understand

It seems as if he might have gotten through to the man
The man looks around at the crowd and smiles

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
It’s good to see you’ve ruined your
own life just as much as you’ve
ruined the lives of others

His words hang in the air a moment The audience stares at
Ansel waiting for a response He’s tried to keep it together
but it’s clear he’s given up

ANSEL
You are right Your sister was
broken But I had nothing to do
with that She had the choice of
living with people who ignored her
controlled her abused her or
dying alone in solidarity with a
suicide cult She made her choice
huh

The entire hall is silent Then the man punches Ansel HARD
in the eye Ansel falls to the ground The man kicks him in
the stomach several times then spits on him

MAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Piece of shit I hope you die
(beat)
And I hope I broke one of your
ribs
Green 13
The audience watches unfazed as if it were part of the show
The man turns and walks away Ansel lays there in the fetal

position moaning loudly and uncontrollably

INT HOTEL - CONFERENCE HALL - EVENING - LATER BxxeK

Hotel staff stack up chairs and getting ready for their next
event a wedding

Ansel is bloodied and bruised He’s got the beginnings of a
black eye He boxes up the unsold books (all of them) and
tries to lift the box onto a dolly but immediately stops and
clutches the right side of his rib cage

An OLDER MARRIED COUPLE approaches from off screen

HUSBAND (0S)
Do you need a hand with that

Ansel almost ignores him but decides he needs the help

ANSEL
Just stack it
(beat)
Please

The man stacks the boxes on the dolly Ansel feels his eye
socket

HUSBAND
This is my wife Evelyn and my
name is Paul

Ansel doesn’t respond

PAUL KEKE
We attended your seminar

ANSEL
Did you buy a book

EVELYN
We already have a copy Big fans

ANSEL
I can sign it for five dollars

PAUL
Oh I don’t think that’1l be
necessary

Ansel goes back about his business

PAUL (CONTD)
Can you make it out to Claire

Evelyn pulls a copy from her purse Though it has Ansel’s
face on the cover it’s not the same book

ANSEL
I don’t sign that book I only sign
this one Put that away please

They’re both taken aback

PAUL
Okay we’ll take one then How
much

ANSEL
Fifteen

Evelyn looks to Paul
ANSEL (CONT’D)
(without hesitation)
Ten
Paul goes through his wallet and pulls out ten dollars
Ansel checks the bill in the light then hands him the book

ANSEL (CONTD)
And you’1l1 want that signed

PAUL
Umm Yes Right

Ansel digs through a box to find a pen Paul hands the book
back to Ansel

EVELYN
I’m sorry about your show

ANSEL
This one just now
Ansel stands there as if waiting

EVELYN
No your television show I thought
it was really something It’s a
shame

ANSEL
I don’t Yeah- Claire you said

PAUL
She’s our daughter

before Paul realizes

PAUL (CONTD)
Oh sorry

He pulls out his wallet and hands Ansel five ones Ansel

counts the bills then signs the opening page

PAUL (CONTD)
That is why we came actually She
is why we are here

EVELYN
We were wondering if we might be
able to talk with you about our
daughter

ANSEL
It has been a long day I just I
need to sleep
(remembering)
In my hotel room At this hotel

EVELYN
We believe she is in a very
dangerous situation Nothing has
been able to get through to her

PAUL
Mr Roth sir People like you
don’t have ads Yellow Pages We do
not know who else to turn to
That’s why we came tonight to see
and speak with you If we could
just take a moment of your time

They stand there a moment
Yellow 16

ANSEL
To be perfectly honest everything
I would tell you would be a half
assed version of something on a
page in that book in your hand
because I just do not give a shit
anymore Good luck with everything

He grabs the dolly of things and leaves

PAUL
We just want our daughter back

Ansel doesn’t look back

EXT HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 9

He wheels the dolly (labelled HOTEL PROPERTY) out to his car
parked in the same spot as before There’s a piece of paper
under his windshield wiper It appears to be a ticket

ANSEL
Goddamnit

Ansel grabs the paper opens it up and begins reading to
himself After a few seconds

INTIMIDATING MAN (0S)
This is a notice

ANSEL
What are you talking about Is this
a court document Am I being KKK
served

INTIMIDATING MAN
In a way yes This is a matter KKK
between two gentlemen my employer KKK

and yourself Putting it in writing
ensures there’s no confusion

ANSEL
Who is your boss

INTIMIDATING MAN
A mister Terry

ANSEL
Terry Terry has been my manager
for ten years Have we met If not
why have I never seen you before

INTIMIDATING MAN
I handle matters that require a
special sort of attention

The man pulls his coat jacket back revealing nothing
There’s nothing

INTIMIDATING MAN (CONT’D)
I don’t carry a gun You want to
know why Because I don’t need one

ANSEL
Okay

INTIMIDATING MAN
I have also been asked to tell you
that Terry has dropped you as a
client That is also in the
document

ANSEL
Is this about the book

INTIMIDATING MAN
Everything is explained clearly and
concisely on the page in your hand
But yes this is about the book
You are to be back in the city ina

Terry would like for you to have
that week to come up with the
money This is very considerate of
him It is strongly advised that

The man laughs as he pats Ansel firmly on the back
INTIMIDATING MAN

INTEXT ANSEL’S CAR - HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 10

Ansel sits in the driver’s seat of his car He stares
straight ahead with his hands clutching the steering wheel

He suddenly turns the key to the ignition After sputtering a
few times the vehicle comes to life

EXT HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 11

Ansel ducks behind his car and awkwardly lowers his face next
to the exhaust pipe He breathes in the exhaust fumes

He takes deeper and deeper breaths He coughs then takes some
more breaths which makes him cough even more After a while
of this though his body can’t take anymore

Ansel rolls away from the car gasping for air He pulls
himself to his hands and knees and throws up It’s sad

INTEXT ANSEL’S CAR - HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING 12

His arms are crossed in an attempt to stay warm but he still
shivers as he sleeps in the driver’s seat of his Chevette

There’s a careful knock on the window He wakes to see Paul
and Evelyn smiling outside the vehicle

PAUL
(muffled through the
glass)
Good morning Mr Roth

Ansel starts up the car and puts his seat upright

ANSEL
I was just leaving

EVELYN
(muffled)
Thank you for the book again

Ansel nods and half waves without making eye contact

ANSEL
Okay that’s fine

He puts the car into gear

PAUL
(muffled)
Can we buy you breakfast

Ansel puts the car back into park and turns off the engine
He rolls the window all the way down via hand crank looks up
at the couple and after all this simply says

ANSEL
Yes

INT RESTROOM - DINER - MORNING 13

- Ansel takes his jacket off and rolls up his sleeves He
washes his face

- He works up a lather in his hair using hand-soap then
rinses in the sink

- He dries his hair under the air dryer The automatic shut

off kicks in after several seconds so he punches the button
again It shuts off again He pushes the button again

INT DINER - MORNING 14

Ansel’s hair is still slightly damp He eats with a ravenous
appetite as Paul and Evelyn talk

PAUL
Our daughter is not well She has
been poisoned She’s someone else
She doesn’t listen to us anymore

EVELYN
She’s not around to listen to us
We haven’t seen her in months And
were not talking about her not
obeying because she’s an adult but--

PAUL
It’s like she’s shut off from the
world

ANSEL

What is the name of the group

PAUL
They call themselves “Faults”

ANSEL
I haven’t heard of that one Who is
the founder

PAUL
We don’t know No one know’s
anything about them We don’t even
know how Claire came to find them

ANSEL
When was the last time you spoke to
her

EVELYN
(looking to Paul)
A week ago On the phone

ANSEL
What did she say

PAUL
I told her that we missed her That
we were worried about her

ANSEL
How did she react to that

PAUL
She told us that she found God and
that she made love with “it” the
night before while others watched

Ansel takes a huge bite of pancake while Evelyn and Paul wait
for him to say something He takes a drink

ANSEL
That does sound troubling

EVELYN
Weve tried everything

ANSEL
Are you still supporting her
financially

EVELYN
No we cut her off last year

ANSEL
Does she have a car

PAUL
They tried to sell it but it was in
my name

ANSEL
You are lucky They usually sell
off items of value to fund the
group

PAUL
A few days later Claire reported it
stolen The next day it turned up
in our driveway

ANSEL
That’s good
Blue 21

PAUL
It was on fire

ANSEL
Have you tried a family
intervention Exit counseling

EVELYN
We did Thanksgiving day The group
discourages interaction with family
and friends especially on what
they call “days of falsities”
Holidays We convinced her to come
That it would be okay

Evelyn becomes choked up

PAUL
When Claire arrived and saw what it
was she immediately turned violent
There was an anger in her eyes I
don’t know if this is going to make
sense but For how weak she
looked emotionally physically
she had a strength that I have
never seen in her before I don’t
want to lose her Mr Roth

Up to this point Ansel has treated this meeting as a free
meal but he no longer can He stops eating

ANSEL
There is one other option you have
here Are you familiar with
deprogramming

This concerns the couple

PAUL
Is that what you did with that man
The one from last night

ANSEL
His sister Yes we attempted a
deprogramming on her six years ago

EVELYN
I don’t I don’t know what that
is

ANSEL

A man named Ted Patrick developed
the method fifteen years ago
(MORE )
ANSEL (CONTD)
We would forcibly take your
daughter away from the group---

EVELYN
Youre talking about kidnapping my
Claire

ANSEL
Under the legal definition yes
But it’s for her own good We would
take her far away to someplace
where she would not know where she
was but more importantly where no
one else would be able to find her
I would begin the process of
breaking her down- Making her
question the group’s beliefs and
their innate contradictions

PAUL
What are the chances of something
like this working

ANSEL
In the end there is a fifty percent
chance you will have your daughter
back--

EVELYN
And a fifty percent chance we will
lose her forever

PAUL
Evelyn

ANSEL
No no She is absolutely right I
need to be honest with you the
chances of this working are even
less than that This is extremely
dangerous for everyone involved
especially Claire But if you
believe in the deepest part of
yourself that you have done
everything you can to save her and
yet she continues to fall away from
you you have to ask yourself “How
far am I willing to go”

Paul and Evelyn look at each other It’s tense

A waitress pops up to the booth unexpectedly

PERKY WAITRESS
Y’all save room for dessert

ANSEL PAUL AND EVELYN
No thank you (shaking their heads
smiling)
No

She scribbles on her pad and leaves the check on the table

PERKY WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Alright well it was a pleasure
serving y’all today Come back and
see us again real soon

Paul takes the check and studies the tab

ANSEL
Thank you for breakfast Paul
Evelyn That brings me to one last
thing if you do decide to do what
we just talked about doing I do
not know how to say this without
sounding insensitive It will not
be cheap

The entirety of this scene will take place from inside the van

The van is in motion There are three men inside all wearing

The two men sprint toward a young woman She’s late twenties
brunette pretty She wears a baggy dress with sandals and
pushes a shopping cart We realize this is CLAIRE

Claire stands there a moment unsure of what is happening but
as they get within a few dozen feet she begins to run still
pushing the cart

Seconds later the men catch up to her and grab her from
behind She grips the cart with all her might and doesn’t let
go They pull her towards the van

The cart tips over onto the ground taking Claire and Raymond
with it She loses her sandals James tries to wrangle her
legs but instead he gets kicked in the face

Raymond hurries to his feet and grabs one of her legs while
James manages to take hold of the other They drag her
towards the van as she keeps hold of the cart She’s
screaming at the top of her lungs over the sound of metal
against asphalt

A few people step into the background of the frame Everyone
looks concerned but no one does anything and cell phones
don’t really exist yet so

until they manage to duct tape her mouth

But this is adjoining with the
other one
(leaning in quieter)
They’re already here

Ansel pauses a beat

He throws the van into reverse and begins to back into a
space near the building between two cars He almost hits a
car He stops corrects and tries again He’s going at the
wrong angle and has to stop again Frustrated he throws it
into drive accelerates into a space in the middle of the lot
and shuts off the engine

ANSEL
We have to be natural about this
We can’t draw attention to
ourselves I need one of you to go
to the room with my things and one
with her and me

INTEXT TRANSPORT VAN - MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 20

James steps out of the van and slams the door shut

Ansel crouches in front of Claire who’s propped up against
the wall Raymond watches

ANSEL

I know you are probably a little
confused about what is happening
right now All you need to know is
that I am your friend

(beat)
These two men with me are not your
friends

Ansel carefully cuts the tape off from around her ankles

ANSEL (CONTD)
In a few moments we are going to
step out of this van and we are
going to walk across this parking
lot up a flight of stairs down a
walkway and into a room

Ansel cuts the tape off from around her wrists

Claire looks at him unsure if she can trust him Ansel feigns
trust in her

ANSEL (CONTD)
If you do anything stupid I will
still be your friend but these men
who are not your friends will hurt
you

He gently tears the tape off of her face

Yellow 28

ANSEL (CONT’D)
Do not do anything stupid I cannot
stress this enough I promise
everything will be okay Nod if you
believe me

She stays perfectly still Ansel nods slightly
ANSEL (CONTD)

(to Raymond)
Open the door

EXT PENNY PINCHER MOTEL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 21

Raymond steps out first followed by Ansel He offers a hand
to Claire who refuses

She exits on her own and almost defiantly begins walking
Ansel calmly puts his hand on her shoulder to slow her down

We track with them all the way from the van to the room

It’s late The place is quiet

They pass between two cars parked near the building Suddenly
Claire grabs the handle to the driver’s side door of one of
the cars It’s unlocked She gets her body halfway inside the
vehicle before Raymond is able to grab her

Raymond grasps her wrist firmly She doesn’t scream but there
are tears in her eyes Ansel closes the car door quietly and
motions to Raymond who releases his grip

They walk up the stairs We see the bottoms of Claire’s bare

feet which are black

EXT PENNY PINCHER MOTEL - UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT 22

As they round the corner at the top of the stairs they
stop

A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL wearing pajamas stands outside room 223
holding an ice bucket She stares at Claire who’s flanked by
two men

They stand there a moment no one moving Ansel has them
start walking again

Claire makes eye contact with the girl as they pass but she
doesn’t say anything The young girl stares as they continue
past her but eventually takes off towards the ice machine

And with that they step inside the room and close the door

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 23xKK

Ansel immediately shutslocks the door and closes the blinds
It’s obvious there’s a sort of routine and he’s done this
before

Claire in a state of shock sits on the edge of the bed
Tears fall down her face as she begins to cry

Without hesitation Ansel flips on the television and turns up
the volume

He notices the queen size bed

ANSEL
Why is there just the one bed

Raymond looks at the bed

ANSEL (CONTD)
Nevermind Where are my things

James hands Ansel his suitcase
Ansel removes a screw driver from a pouch inside

He opens the door to the bathroom and reverses the knobs so
that the lock is now on the outside instead of the inside
When he finishes

ANSEL (CONTD)
(to James)
You come here

James walks over

ANSEL (CONTD)
Is my car here

JAMES
In the back row near the lamp
post Where’s my money

Ansel removes a copy of his book from the suitcase and opens
it up to reveal an envelope He takes the keys to the van out
of his pant pocket and holds both in his hand

ANSEL
You drive the van straight back to
the lot No stopping except for
gas
James takes the envelope and keys from Ansel’s hand

Green JAMES
Is there per diem for that

ANSEL
Yes There is an extra thirty to go
along with your share which should
take care of it You are not to
contact us You do not speak of
this to anyone No one

stares him down

The two men stare each other down

Ansel tries to stand strong but ends up looking down at the

ANSEL (CONT’D)

There is one last thing

He vouched for you and I appreciate
your help

(beat still quiet)
I told you no one lays a hand on
her You should not have done that

JAMES
What the fuck are you going to do
about it

ground submissively

James
turns
Ansel

James
opens
him

Claire stares blankly at the screen Ansel steps between her

the door and leaves

and the television

ANSEL
That was not a smart thing you did
back there with the car

She stares through him

ANSEL (CONT’D)
I hope something like that does not
happen again Remember that I am
here to help

Claire’s gaze focuses on Ansel

Ansel

James cracks a smile

shifts his weight The grin falls from his face He
Ansel locks the dead-bolt behind

KKKK

looks at Claire who’s eye is swollen from the slap She
and stares James down only she doesn’t give in like

Green 31

CLAIRE
(tearing up)
Help
ANSEL
I know right now that makes little
sense
CLAIRE
What do you want with me
ANSEL
I will explain things to you in the
morning
CLAIRE

I just want to go home
Ansel pauses for a moment

ANSEL
You will I promise

Ansel walks over to Raymond who’s standing in the corner of
the room He talks so Claire can’t hear him

ANSEL (CONTD)
Make sure she doesn’t sleep KKK

Raymond nods
Ansel takes a pillow and blanket from the bed and lays down

on the floor in front of the door The glow from the set
flickers on the walls of the room He closes his eyes

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING 24xxkK

Ansel wakes to the tinny sound of the TV’s mono speaker He
sits up and sees Claire sitting in the exact same spot in
front of the TV Raymond stands against the wall visibly
tired

Ansel stands and peers through the blinds
He grabs his suitcase and walks towards Raymond

ANSEL
How did she do

RAYMOND
She didn’t move a muscle

Green 32

ANSEL
Good

RAYMOND
This is going to sound bad I
probably shouldn’t tell you this
but I know I fell asleep a couple
times last night Cat naps or

whatever
ANSEL
Ok You are right That does sound KRKK
bad kK
RAYMOND
The reason I’m telling you this is
because She could have done

something and she didn’t
Ansel looks at Claire
ANSEL

(to Raymond)
I need to get ready

INT BATHROOM - ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING 25KK

- Ansel showers

- He shaves leaving his mustache intact

- He gets dressed in his brown suit from before

As he puts on his shoes a drop of blood falls next to his
foot onto the tile Another drop falls on the grout between
another set of tiles

Ansel’s nose is bleeding He tilts his head back and inspects
himself in the mirror He plugs the nostril with a rolled up

piece of toilet paper

He tries to wipe up the blood from the floor but the grout is
stained

He searches for something to clean the stain and spots a
small ball of steel wool in the trash can He takes it
pretreats the spot with a bar of soap and some water then
scrubs the grout clean

Ansel rinses the steel wool in the sink and shakes it dry

There’s a knock on the bathroom door

Green 33

RAYMOND (0S)
How much longer you gonna be I
need to take off

ANSEL
Coming

Without thinking Ansel puts the steel wool in his jacket
pocket and gathers his things

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER 2Ox

Ansel exits the bathroom to find Claire still watching TV

RAYMOND
(re Ansel’s nose)
Are you okay

ANSEL
Fine Everything is fine

Ansel retrieves another envelope from his suitcase and gives
it to Raymond

ANSEL (CONT’D)
I need you to knock on the door and
check in with Just say you’re
with me

RAYMOND
Will do You’re on your own now

Raymond goes to leave but takes one last look at Claire
before he exits the room

Ansel locks the door behind him He takes the toilet paper
out of his nose and checks for blood It’s stopped He tosses
it in the trash

He turns off the TV and pulls up a chair in front of Claire
Her eyes are dry and bloodshot

ANSEL
How are you

CLAIRE
They’re going to find me You
realize there is no hiding from
them

ANSEL
He said you did not try to sleep
Why not

CLAIRE
I couldn’t

ANSEL
Aren’t you tired

CLAIRE
Yes

ANSEL
Do you know why you are here

She doesn’t respond

ANSEL (CONT’D)
You have a family A mother and
father and they love you like crazy
but they feel like they have lost

you--
CLAIRE
They did this
ANSEL
They are worried about you Claire
CLAIRE
Don’t call me that She was weak
and stupid
ANSEL

What would you like me to call you

CLAIRE
Just don’t call me that

ANSEL
We won’t say that name

CLAIRE
Why are you doing this

ANSEL
My name is Ansel Roth I ama
counselor I specialize in helping
people who are lost and who may be
under the control of others

CLAIRE
I’m not lost I found myself And I
choose to live my life the way I
live because God wills it
ANSEL
I am here because I want to learn
I want you to tell me about
yourself About your choices

CLAIRE
Where are my parents

ANSEL
That is not important This is just
you and me right now

Claire is seething

ANSEL (CONTD)
Tell me what you are thinking right
now

CLAIRE
I’m thinking about how I want to
rip your tongue out of your throat
so you’ll shut up That you’re
close enough that I could reach out
and strangle you with my bare hands
and that I’d like to I’m just
waiting for a sign from God

ANSEL
That is understandable
(beat)
Just so you know I am probably
going to move back a little now

Ansel stands up and moves his chair a couple feet back He

stays standing

ANSEL (CONTD)
I was not being facetious when I
said I was here to learn

SMOKE suddenly begins to permeate from Ansel’s jacket

pocket

ANSEL (CONTD)
I know it does not seem like it now
but this will be a positive
experience At least try not to
kill me until you have had a chance
to hear me out signs from God be
damned

Ansel’s pocket full on catches fire

Green 36
CLAIRE
I need to go to the bathroom
Ansel realizes he’s on fire

ANSEL
Ahhh

He tears off his jacket and throws it on the ground He
quickly stomps out the fire then stares at the jacket in
disbelief

Ansel picks up the burnt jacket and reaches into the pocket
He pulls out the now charred 9 volt battery he took from the
hotel room He “hot potatoes” it several times before
inspecting it A small piece of steel wool clings to it

He looks up at Claire Neither says anything

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 2Z7RKKK

Ansel tests the lock to the bathroom door demonstrating that
it can no longer be locked from the inside Claire looks at
him like he’s crazy

ANSEL
I have to be sure you won’t hurt
yourself

She steps into the bathroom and turns back at him

CLAIRE
Like that would stop me You might
as well take the door of the
hinges You can just watch me
then You’d like that wouldn’t
you

Claire pulls her dress up and starts to pull down her
underwear but Ansel turns his head and closes the door

Ansel stands by the door for a moment but decides to give her
some privacy

He notices the mini bar and begins looking through its
contents

ANSEL
(shouting to Claire)
You can have a pop if you like

There’s no response Ansel skims the laminated price list on
the door of the fridge

ANSEL (CONT’D)
Also the chocolate isn’t too
expensive

He straightens up sensing the quiet He walks to the bathroom
door which is open a crack We hear Claire crying softly He
knocks lightly then opens the door

Claire sits on the floor against the bathtub with her knees
to her chest

ANSEL (CONTD)
You need to come out

Claire begins to yell though it’s at conversational volume
Ansel doesn’t say anything at first but eventually

ANSEL (CONTD)
What are you doing

Claire continues to yell only slightly louder now

ANSEL (CONTD)
Come on Let’s sit back down and
talk

She gets louder

ANSEL (CONTD)
You need to stop

Louder still This is now a problem

Ansel stands there for a moment She stops abruptly then
SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS Ansel charges her and
wrestles his hand over her mouth

ANSEL (CONTD)
Calm down Listen to me Just
listen Five days That’s all this
is Five days

Claire begins to calm

ANSEL (CONTD)
After those five days you can do
whatever it is you are going to do
You can go wherever you want to go
and no one will stop you All you
need to do is talk to me

(beat)
(MORE)

Green 38

ANSEL (CONTD)
Do you want me to take my hand off
your mouth

She nods He lets go and gives her some space

CLAIRE
Five days

ANSEL
I promise

CLAIRE
Then I can go home

ANSEL
After that wherever you consider
home to be you can go there yes
Just promise me you will listen
Not just to me To yourself

CLAIRE
Okay

She notices something
CLAIRE (CONTD)
Your nose is bleeding again I hit

you

He checks it Yep it’s bleeding He goes to the sink and
turns on the water

ANSEL
I don’t think you did I don’t know
why this keeps happening

CLAIRE
Here let me

She hops to her feet and wipes her eyes She grabs some
toilet paper and places her hand behind his head

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Tilt your head back

She holds the wad of paper to his nose Neither talks they
just stand there for a while

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - EVENING 2Bx

Claire sits with her legs crossed in the middle of the bed
facing Ansel who’s sitting in a chair nearby
ANSEL
Do you mind me asking how old you
are

CLAIRE
Age doesn’t mean anything

ANSEL
You mean in the group

CLAIRE
The time it takes for our Earth to
circle the Sun Why Why does that
matter It’s an abstraction Why is
Earth so special Time means
nothing in eternity

ANSEL
Your parents told me you were
twenty eight

CLAIRE
You shouldn’t ask questions you
know the answers to

ANSEL

Youre right I’m sorry

(beat)

Can you tell me about The Faults
CLAIRE

Faults No “the” just Faults
ANSEL

Faults
CLAIRE

From a fault comes a change
Destruction leads to something new

ANSEL
Do you believe a change is on the
way

CLAIRE
I don’t want to talk about that

ANSEL
(smiling)
How about this Who is your
favorite band You like music

CLAIRE
We don’t listen to music

ANSEL
I mean before

She thinks

ANSEL (CONTD)
Rock and roll Pop

CLAIRE
(unsure)
Pop

ANSEL
Did you like Duran Duran
(no response)
Mr Mister
(nothing)
Go-Gos

CLAIRE
Why are you saying them twice

ANSEL
Has it been that long

She’s almost embarrassedconfused by her lack of memory

ANSEL (CONTD)
Any pets back home

CLAIRE
A dog

ANSEL
What was its name

CLAIRE
I know what you’re trying to do
The past means nothing

Ansel leans forward in his seat

ANSEL
How did they find you

CLAIRE
I found them I was searching for
them my whole life

ANSEL
But did someone hand you a pamphlet
or did you have a friend who--

Yellow CLAIRE
No You don’t understand I was
meant to find them I had to One
day I stepped outside and I walked
I walked until I reached a house I
had never been to this place before
but I knew it I had seen it
Something told me to walk in and I
did

ANSEL
And they took you in

CLAIRE
I had been with them my whole life
but at that moment my physical self
was home

ANSEL
Can you describe the group

CLAIRE
In what context

ANSEL
Who they are Gender race age
I know these things don’t mean
anything to you but it helps me
understand

CLAIRE
Men and women Mostly men No young
ones but everyone else

ANSEL
No children

CLAIRE
Parasites We don’t have time to
wait for them to grow autonomous

ANSEL
So something is going to happen
soon

CLAIRE
I told you I don’t want to talk
about that

ANSEL
Right
(beat)
How many people make up the group

KKK
CLAIRE

Thirty Sometimes more sometimes

less It keeps changing

ANSEL

Tell me what role you play Claire--

She winces

ANSEL (CONTD)

Sorry That was an accident Who

are you in Faults

CLAIRE

We are all students every one of

us

ANSEL
So there is a teacher

CLAIRE
We teach each other

ANSEL

There must be someone in charge

The person who came first
CLAIRE
(smiling)
God

ANSEL
Who is God

CLAIRE

You have to answer that yourself

ANSEL

Youre probably very tired When
were tired we think less and feel
more Today I wanted you to feel

Do you understand
(beat)

We should stop there You did very

well
Claire smiles ever so slightly

CLAIRE
Thank you

Ansel thinks to himself He reaches out

and touches her hand

Green 43

ANSEL
I was not planning on doing this so
soon I want to show you something
Is that okay

An air of concern comes across Claire’s face

Ansel stands up and walks over to a door next to the
television stand He unlocks the knob on his side and opens
the door There’s another door that is locked from the other
side

ANSEL (CONT’D)
I know this is going to be hard for
you but I feel like you are ready
He knocks on the door several times We hear the door unlock
from the other side

INT ROOM 205 ROOM 206 - MOTEL - EVENING - CONTINUOUS 2ZQRKKK

It opens to reveal Claire’s parents and a mirrored version of
room 205 This new adjoining room is room number 206 aRKK

Claire is unsure of how to respond

Evelyn is smiling though it’s clear she’s holding back tears
Paul breaks the silence

PAUL
Hi sweetie

Claire stays on the bed Silence

ANSEL
This is a lot I know I just
wanted you to see them and know
they were here I don’t want to
keep secrets from you

Nothing from Claire

ANSEL (CONTD)
Paul Evelyn I think that’s enough
for tonight Let’s give her a
chance to process everything

CLAIRE
(bursting into tears)
Mommy Daddy
Green 44

Claire walks over to her father cautiously and puts her
arms around him Her mother now crying too hugs both of
them

Ansel is at a loss for words Not what he was expecting at
all

PAUL
Our baby Our Claire

Claire pulls away suddenly The parents are unsure of what
happened

ANSEL
(quiet to the parents)
That’s alright She’s not
associating with that identity
right now but that’s alright

EVELYN
What is that supposed to mean
Claire

Claire gets back on the bed and hugs herself

ANSEL
(quiet)
This is absolutely normal There
are two identities in a case such
as hers The before identity
before the cult and the cult
identity

PAUL
She’s still our girl

ANSEL
Yes and no There is even a third
identity that we will come to know
when this is all over the post
identity It will be a combination
of the first two only the
percentage of each will be
determined by how successful we are
over the next few days We cannot
force her to become Claire It may KKK
come but it has to be at her speed

EVELYN
What do we call her

Green 45

ANSEL
You don’t She doesn’t want that
Names of affection are fine Baby
sweetie honey Whatever you called
her back when things were normal

PAUL
We never called her honey

ANSEL
Don’t call her that then

Ansel looks back at Claire She’s watching the blinds which
move with the flow of the air conditioner

ANSEL (CONTD)
She needs to sleep Today was good
Tonight we should keep the doors
closed

PAUL
Can’t we talk to her a little more

ANSEL
In the morning I want to doa
session with her in the morning but
after that I want to bring you both
in Is that alright

They nod take one last look at their daughter then close and
lock their door Ansel closes and locks his too

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - NIGHT 30

Ansel comes out of the bathroom to find Claire in the bed
under the covers She isn’t in the middle of the queen size
bed instead she lays towards one side He watches her for a
moment

CLAIRE
I’m not asleep

ANSEL
I was just Sorry

CLAIRE
I left space for you

He hesitates ever so slightly before

ANSEL
Ill sleep on the floor

Green 46

Ansel picks up the blanket and pillow he used the night
before and remakes his pallet in front of the front door

Claire notices this and sits up

CLAIRE
I’m not going to leave

ANSEL
I trust you but

CLAIRE
I understand

Ansel lays down He takes off his pants under the blanket
CLAIRE (CONTD)
You want to know why I’m not going
to leave I feel like this is an
opportunity God is giving me a
chance to save them

ANSEL
Who Your parents

CLAIRE
I can teach them

Beat

ANSEL
Can you turn off the light

Claire twists the knob on the lamp CLICK- Darkness

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING 31x

Ansel wakes shivering He lays on the floor in his underwear
and a t-shirt blanket off to the side

We reveal Claire is standing above him She’s wearing a man’s
button-up shirt that covers her just enough

Ansel’s eyes open At first he’s unsure of where he is until
he sees her He realizes he’s half naked and quickly covers

up

CLAIRE
Good morning

ANSEL
What time is it

CLAIRE
It’s light out

ANSEL

(embarrassed)
Can you hand me my pants- to me

She picks them up and hands them to him
He awkwardly puts them on under the blanket

ANSEL (CONTD)
Is that my shirt

CLAIRE
I need a change of clothes

ANSEL
Your parents brought some from
home We will see them in a couple
of hours

CLAIRE
Okay

ANSEL
Can you put your dress back on

She’s slightly annoyed by this She grabs her dress from the
bed and goes into the bathroom She leaves the door open but
we can’t see from our angle

Ansel folds the blanket and puts it and the pillow away He
begins making the bed

Claire comes out and tosses the shirt towards Ansel

CLAIRE
You don’t have to do that

ANSEL
There won’t be any housekeeping--

Claire messes up the sheets

Ansel picks up his shirt

ANSEL (CONTD)
Did you spray this with something

CLAIRE
No With what
Green 48

ANSEL
It smells floral It’s so faint

CLAIRE
I don’t have anything

Ansel shakes his head

ANSEL
Sorry I know
(beat)
Would you be okay talking with me
this morning

CLAIRE
Will my parents be there

ANSEL

Just us first Is that okay with
you

32 INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING 32KK

Claire sits on the floor this time Ansel starts off in the
chair

ANSEL
I want to talk with you some more
about Faults

CLAIRE
What do you want to know

ANSEL
Sometimes if you don’t know much
about something you cannot ask the
right questions What would you
like for me to know

Claire thinks

CLAIRE
I’ve learned a lot about myself
since I found them
(beat)
Are you familiar with meditation

ANSEL
I am yes I do not myself but I
am familiar with the process
CLAIRE
I had never meditated before I
can’t picture my current life now
without it I have goals

ANSEL
What kind of goals

CLAIRE
There are levels The levels are
goals one can achieve if they put
their mind to it Anyone can do
this they just haven’t been taught

ANSEL
What level are you at

CLAIRE
Moving from level to level takes
will I’ve grown so much but I
don’t know if I’m strong enough At
least not in time

ANSEL
In time for what What is going to
happen

CLAIRE

I cannot say
ANSEL

Why not
CLAIRE

Because I don’t know Ira tells
ANSEL

What’s wrong Who is Ira
CLAIRE

I I shouldn’t have said
ANSEL

The leader

CLAIRE
Ira is the connection between us
and what happens next

ANSEL
Is he the one who brought you all
together

Blue CLAIRE
Ira is not a man

ANSEL
So Ira is a woman

CLAIRE
No Ira has moved past the human
form

ANSEL
You will have to forgive me but I’m
not sure I understand what you are
saying

CLAIRE
We are all weighed down by our
physical form The levels are the
steps we take towards freeing
ourselves

ANSEL
What does that mean though

CLAIRE
Each level means a piece of
control

ANSEL
But that doesn’t really mean
anything You have to see that they
are teaching you in these vague
terms and unprovable ideas

CLAIRE

(defensive)
You don’t know Control means all
matter loses meaning Control of
oneself means control of others It
even changes the way others
perceive our light- our image Or
do not see it

ANSEL
(thinking)
Are you talking about invisibility
(beat)
Have you witnessed this

CLAIRE
(dead serious)
I have

Green 51

ANSEL
Can you tell me what happens
when you reach the final level
When you become free

CLAIRE
One moves on

ANSEL
Where do the people who move on go

INT ROOM 206 - MOTEL - DAY 33x

Claire’s mom opens a duffle bag full of clothes and dumps the
contents onto one of the twin beds in the room Claire picks
through the garments hesitantly

ANSEL
(to Paul)
I see they put you in a room with
two beds

PAUL
Yes

ANSEL
Perhaps you and Evelyn would be
more comfortable with the queen

PAUL
We’re comfortable
ANSEL
It’s just I gave her the bed
PAUL
Good
ANSEL

It’s one bed so I’m on the floor

For the first time we see a slightly different side to
Paul

PAUL
(intimidating)
We are not moving

ANSEL
Sure

PAUL
What is that smell on you
ANSEL
I

Paul quickly focuses in on what the women are doing

CLAIRE
I don’t want to wear any of these

EVELYN
Sweetie these are your clothes

CLAIRE
I don’t wear stuff like this
anymore

PAUL

I like this one
Paul holds up a slightly revealing top

CLAIRE
I’m not wearing that

PAUL
I like this one

CLAIRE
Yes daddy

Ansel looks on
Paul picks up a pair of shorts

PAUL
And this Go put these on

Claire takes the clothes to the bathroom

ANSEL
Wait Your mother should go with

Ansel motions to Evelyn She joins Claire They close
door

PAUL

let her

ANSEL

When did she last wear these

the

She was a teenager Sixteen maybe

ANSEL
Don’t you think they might be a
bit young

PAUL

What are you trying to say
ANSEL

Nothing
PAUL

My daughter looks beautiful in

When she comes out you’re going to

tell her she looks beautiful

ANSEL
I’m not going to say that

PAUL
Remember who’s paying you

Claire and Evelyn exit the bathroom The clothes are a size
too small and all around more revealing than Claire obviously

CLAIRE

You didn’t do anything That’s the

point

PAUL
Your mother and I fed you We put a
roof over your head

CLAIRE
You make it sound like an
obligation

PAUL
Maybe that’s because it was

ANSEL
We are not here to pass blame

PAUL
But we’re all here because of her

ANSEL

Odd

ANSEL
Everyone take a deep breath

Green 55

CLAIRE

I’m here because I thought you’d
see that I’m happy I’ve never been
this happy in all my life

The phone in 205 begins to ring KK

EVELYN
We need you home with us

Claire sobs through the words

CLAIRE
But I’m afraid KKK

These words sting Claire’s father He calms turning off the
anger as if he flipped a switch He walks over to Claire

ANSEL
I don’t think that’s a good idea--

But Paul is already sitting next to his daughter He holds
her tightly She lets herself be held She goes to a certain
place almost as if she were a child who’s been punished and
seeks forgiveness Evelyn watches silently Distant

ON ANSEL AS
The phone continues to ring Ansel is unsure if he should

leave the room Finally he gets up and walks through the
shared door into

We might hear bits and pieces of Intimidating Mans dialogue
from Ansels receiver but it is here primarily for timing
purposes

ANSEL
Sorry well keep it down

Intimidating MAN
Good I’d hate to have to come up

Ansel’s reaction tells us this isn’t motel management

that says “Terrance Hobbs - Talent Manager”

TERRY (CONTD)

He hates when I call him Michael
He goes by Mick but I’m just not
okay with the whole nickname or

outside of one of the motel rooms

Ansel stops at first then realizing it’s a body he begins
running towards it

It’s Claire She’s laying unconscious outside of room 205 in
her underwear and socks Her nose is bloody

Ansel reaches her and tries desperately to wake her but she’s
out cold He bangs on the door to the room He feels for a
pulse then bangs on the door again

There’s a sound of locks being undone before door opens to
reveal Paul

What did you do

He sees his daughter

Oh my god

Ansel picks her up and carries her through the door into

to get up from yet Ansel pulls back the sheets and puts a
pillow under her head

You gotta wake up Claire

He lightly slaps her face a few times No response

EVELYN
What happened Is she alive

She’s breathing Get me some water-
Cold water

Evelyn goes to the bathroom door It’s locked from the
outside

The door to 206 is closed Claire and Ansel are alone

Claire sits in the middle of the bed She seems back to
normal Ansel is in a chair beside the bed He has a small
bandage over the cut on his cheek

ANSEL
I wanted to talk to you about what
happened yesterday

CLAIRE

I don’t remember anything

(beat)

Why did you have them lock me up
ANSEL

It was in everyone’s best interest
CLAIRE

Not mine

Especially yours

She looks down and traces the floral print of the comforter
with her finger

KKKK

ANSEL (CONTD)
How did you get out of the
bathroom
(waits)
Claire how did you get out of the
bathroom

It’s a calculated risk on his part The name elicits a slight
twitch from Claire but there’s no outburst this time

CLAIRE
Come sit next to me

ANSEL
I can’t

CLAIRE
Please

He sees something in her eyes Something trying to get out

Ansel gets up from the chair and sits on the bed with her
She scoots towards him a little

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I was scared The second you left
he

ANSEL
What

CLAIRE
Nothing When it got dark out they
put me in there and locked the
door I felt like you had abandoned
me

This hurts Ansel

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I’ve been good I have been seeing
things from a set of eyes other
than my own I haven’t thought much
about the group

ANSEL
That’s good to hear

CLAIRE
But when you left I didn’t know
what to do and I- I started to
pray I started praying in there
and prayer turned to meditation and
I I don’t know

ANSEL
You can tell me

CLAIRE
I imagined myself I imagined
stepping out of Claire’s body and
being able to see in a way I’ve
never seen before I don’t know
what but something inside me told
me to walk through the bathroom
door so I did

ANSEL
It opened

CLAIRE
I walked through the door And I
was in the room I could see my
parents sleeping but I knew that
even if they woke up they wouldn’t
be able to see me I knew I was
beyond being seen

Ansel listens intently

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I stayed there for a moment
watching them but something didn’t
feel right I felt like I was being
pulled back towards Claire I
reached the front door and stepped
through it as well but it didn’t
feel the same It hurt I fell to
the ground on the other side

ANSEL
Where I found you in the morning

CLAIRE
I’ve moved up a level Ansel
Claire is a part of me I accept
that but I am not her I’m
changing

ANSEL
The other day you told me that
Faults teaches you That through
their teachings I don’t believe
you walked through walls I want to
believe you but I can’t

Believing is the first step

Becoming

bed

Ansel opens the door to room 206 He finds Paul and Evelyn
sitting on the edge of each of their beds It’s dark They

are silent and still

Ansel stands where he can still see Claire
every few seconds to make sure she’s still there

The parents haven’t moved

ANSEL
(quiet)
She can’t be alone

Paul turns to look at Ansel

ANSEL (CONTD)
Did you hear me From now on she is
not to be left alone Someone
always has to be with her

PAUL
Is something wrong

ANSEL
Yes- I mean no I’m not sure I
just feel the best thing to do
right now We need to make sure
we don’t lose her We’re so close

Ansel looks down as he says

ANSEL (CONTD)
And I need the rest of my payment

Paul stands up slowly He approaches Ansel

PAUL
What did you just ask me

ANSEL
I need the money Paul

KKKK

He turns his head

PAUL
Not until she’s Claire again

Ansel takes a step back

ANSEL
--

PAUL

ANSEL
I can’t guarantee she will- Paul

PAUL
Why

ANSEL
It isn’t all up to me in this
There are other factors at play

Ansel takes a step forward

ANSEL (CONT’D)
I want the money now I don’t trust
you I don’t trust any of this
Everything is fucked and I have to
look out for myself

Paul explodes forward and grabs him by the neck He backs
Ansel up and slams him against the wall

PAUL
Fuck yourself- This is about my
daughter Give her back to us She
needs to come home

Paul tightens his grip Ansel can’t breathe at all now
Evelyn hasn’t moved an inch She continues to stare forward

Don’t think I don’t know what goes
on behind that door Do you think
I’m stupid

No I promise He hasn’t done
anything Please

Ansel tries to say something but all that comes out is a
gurgling sound and a little spit
Just as his eyes begin to roll back into his head Paul
releases him Ansel falls to the ground trying to catch his
breath
Paul begins crying loudly but with no actual tears

CLAIRE (CONTD)

(to her father)
Go to bed

He stops crying almost immediately

PAUL
Okay sweetheart

He brushes her hair behind her ear She pulls away
Claire stands by Ansel who’s still on the ground

Paul and Evelyn each get into their beds fully clothed and
get under the covers

Claire helps Ansel to his feet They walk through the door
into

What about the money That’s what
this is for you isn’t it

ANSEL

see that You can’t leave

He stops packing

CLAIRE
And I need you here I feel like
I’m close to something but I

don’t know what’s happening

ANSEL
What do you mean

CLAIRE
I don’t know I think Faults knows
what’s happening It’s like Ira is
calling me home

ANSEL
Do you think it’s going to happen
Are you are going to step outside
of yourself again

The room is dark except for the light that leaks out of the
partially opened bathroom door

Claire is asleep in the bed Ansel sits on the motel room
floor against the front door watching her sleep between
moments of nodding off Claire begins to stir

She gets up from the bed and walks to the bathroom Light
pours into the room and briefly illuminates Ansel when she
opens the door She closes it partially

She’s quiet at first Ansel gets to his feet and walks slowly
towards the bathroom door Still no sign of her presence
What is she doing

As Ansel is about to reach the door he hears the sound of her
peeing He relaxes Ansel props himself against the wall

outside the bathroom his back towards its door He begins to
nod off once again

The sound stops The toilet flushes The door cracks opens
illuminating the room Claire approaches Ansel from behind
She’s naked from the waist down

She softly wraps her arms around him His eyes open slowly
and when he realizes what’s happening he pulls himself away
from her He sees that she’s nude

Claire isn’t deterred She walks towards him and puts her
arms on his waist Ansel stands there motionless as if ina
trance

Claire stands on the balls of her feet and kisses him on the
lips At first he doesn’t reciprocate but after a moment he
kisses her back He keeps his eyes wide open for all of
this

They stand there for a moment until Ansel shoves her away
from him but she immediately goes back in and kisses him
again this time more forcefully She is in charge

CLAIRE
Lick my face

ANSEL
What

CLAIRE
(demanding)
Lick me

Ansel licks her face It’s awkward and not sexy at all In
fact none of this is the least bit sexy

Claire pushes Ansel into a chair He falls into it and she
immediately climbs onto his lap She grabs his face and
continues to dominate the interaction

Claire’s nose begins to bleed Ansel notices and has to force
himself away from her lips to tell her

ANSEL
(out of breath)
Your nose

CLAIRE
Shut up

She goes right back in His eyes focus on her nose for a
second but his eyes begin to close They spring back open
then droop again He’s kissing her back less and less and
more just being kissed She notices this

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I need you to sleep now Ansel

He’s fighting the urge His eyes are crossing His speech
begins to slur

there in front of Ansel is Claire laying on her back on the
bed with her father on top of her Her mother is sitting on

me

ANSEL

CLAIRE
Where were they going

ANSEL

night

ANSEL
Youre lying to me Why are you

Ansel grabs her arms and shakes her

ANSEL
What the fuck is going on

The door to the bathroom slowly begins to shut behind them
Neither notices

ANSEL (CONTD)
We You made me lick you

CLAIRE
You’re scaring me Ansel

ANSEL
How did you--

CLICK The door closes shut Ansel turns around and tries to
open it It’s locked

CLAIRE
Open it

ANSEL
It’s locked

CLAIRE
Why is it locked

ANSEL
I didn’t lock it- Why would I lock
it Why is it locked

Ansel throws his body into the door Nothing He does it
again Nothing He takes a step back and really throws his
weight into it Still nothing

ANSEL (CONTD)
There’s something blocking it on
the other side
Yellow 81

CLAIRE
That doesn’t make any sense Why
are you doing this

Ansel SCREAMS
The phone begins to ring in the other room
ANSEL
(realizing)

Fuck That’s Terry Terry is
calling I have to answer that

Fuck

CLAIRE
Let me out I want to get out of
here

ANSEL

Stop Just stop

He throws himself into the door with everything he has this
time but injures his shoulder in the process

CLAIRE
Are you okay

ANSEL
NO I’M NOT FUCKING OKAY- OKAY

He slides down the door to the floor and begins to cry He’s
completely lost it

The phone stops ringing

ANSEL (CONTD)
What is happening to me

Claire steps towards Ansel and holds his head against her
thighs comforting him She begins to hum but not a song or
melody It’s more of a droning sound It calms Ansel

She finishes humming and sits down in front of him

CLAIRE
They left your pay It’s yours Is KKK
that who Terry is in this Is he
why you need the money

Ansel wipes away tears He’s like a child post tantrum He
nods

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Why do you let him control you

ANSEL
I owe him
CLAIRE
Is he your God
ANSEL
No
CLAIRE
Then how could you possibly owe
him
ANSEL
He helped me when I needed help
CLAIRE
He took advantage of you
ANSEL
No
CLAIRE
Yes
ANSEL

Nothing happens the way it should
with me Everything fails

CLAIRE

What are your failures
ANSEL

My marriage failed
CLAIRE

Why
ANSEL

Because of money

CLAIRE
That’s an excuse Why did your
marriage fail

ANSEL
I don’t know

CLAIRE
Why did your marriage fail

He tears up
ANSEL
Because I’m a failure

CLAIRE
And she saw that

ANSEL
She already knew She just
acknowledged it

CLAIRE
Why are you a failure

ANSEL
Because I’ve only ever been good at
one thing and All of this is her
fault

CLAIRE
Your wife

ANSEL
No A girl

CLAIRE
What was her name

ANSEL
Jennifer

CLAIRE
What was her name

The repeat question throws Ansel off

ANSEL
Jennifer

CLAIRE
Who was Jennifer

ANSEL
She Do you know the Universal
Concurrence We did one of these
exactly like this with her
But

CLAIRE
What

ANSEL
Nothing It doesn’t matter

CLAIRE
What happened

ANSEL
I did my job She questioned her
choices and went home with her
family but the family didn’t put
in the work

CLAIRE

She was the one on your show
ANSEL

She I
CLAIRE

You had her on two days after the
group suicide No one had access to
her like you did

He’s on the defensive mind spinning rationalizing

ANSEL
We flew her out It was all
expenses paid It was supposed to
be a nice vacation for her

CLAIRE
You exploited your relationship
with her
ANSEL
No
CLAIRE
You did it for ratings
ANSEL
No
CLAIRE

You knew she was fragile and yet
you put her out there for the world
to judge

He’s losing it again

ANSEL
She agreed to it all How could I
have known that she still felt a
connection to the Concurrence
Yellow 85

CLAIRE
How could you not have known You KKK
pressed her You opened the wound
You gave her the knife and she slit
her wrists with it

ANSEL
She chose to be with them She had
free will

CLAIRE
Did she really

Ansel’s looks to the ground

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Look me in my eyes and tell me you
don’t blame yourself

ANSEL
Everyone does

She SLAPS him He’s in shock

CLAIRE
No- Look at me Listen to my words
Feel them Are you to blame for
Jennifers death

He looks into her eyes and finds salvation in them He begins
to cry After some time

ANSEL
I was in control I used her
(he releases)
I could have helped her but I chose
not to I made the choice

CLAIRE
And that choice cost you
everything

ANSEL
Everything Yes

CLAIRE
Tell me what you lost I want to
hear it

ANSEL
My show Money My house My wife--
CLAIRE
NO
(composing herself)
Those are things What did you
lose

Long pause

ANSEL
Every kind of respect

CLAIRE
Are you happy with who you are

Ansel shakes his head “No”

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Do you owe Terry your happiness

ANSEL
No

CLAIRE
What do you owe him

He’s mesmerized by her

ANSEL
Nothing
CLAIRE
Do you owe him your money
ANSEL
No
CLAIRE

The only person you owe is

CLAIRE

Does what I say make sense to you

ANSEL

It makes more sense than anything I

have ever heard

CLAIRE
How do you feel

ANSEL
Clear Free

CLAIRE
Close your eyes

Ansel closes them

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Push everything out of your mind
Picture yourself where you are
right at this very moment

He shifts a little

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Don’t move Be still Imagine you
are composed of two parts Two
“yous” One lives inside the other
This you has lived inside the other
its entire existence because it did
not know any other way Do you see
the other you

ANSEL
I see him

CLAIRE
I want you to pull him out of you
Rip him from inside you and look at
yourself from outside yourself

Ansel’s face turns red and his nose begins to bleed

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Do you see

ANSEL
I see

CLAIRE
You are seeing yourself from a
vantage point you have never seen
This is how others see you What do
you see

ANSEL
Loneliness Sadness Weakness

CLAIRE
I want you to walk through the
door Ansel I want you to picture
yourself walking through the door
as if it isn’t even there

Green 88
CLAIRE (CONTD)
(waiting)
Are you through

ANSEL
I am on the other side

CLAIRE
I want you to unlock the door

He exhales slightly
CLAIRE (CONTD)
Pull the other you back Ansel
Bring it back to you Let your two
selves become one again Open your
eyes

He opens his eyes He wipes the blood away from his nostril

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Open the door

Ansel stands up and turns the knob The door opens

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Do you trust me

ANSEL
Unquestionably

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - NIGHT 62KKK

ANGLE ON the front door There’s a loud BANGING

MICK (0S)
Roth open up I know you’re in
there Front desk says you haven’t
checked out

We hear the sounds of Mick picking the lock A CLICK is
heard The door swings open Mick takes a peak in The room
is empty

He checks the bathroom no one

He begins walking back towards the front door but stops when
he sees Ansel’s suitcase He begins picking through it as

The door to room 206 slowly and silently creeps open Ansel
appears brandishing the screwdriver from earlier He walks up
behind Mick who’s still squatting down and drives it into the
back of Mick’s head

Green 89

EXT PENNY PINCHER MOTEL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 63

Terry waits in the car in the passenger seat He looks up at

the open door to room 205 KKK
TERRY
(to himself)
Come on Michael
Terry keeps his eyes trained on the door Nothing
TERRY (CONTD)
Jeez-louise What is taking so
long
He pushes his way out the car and shuts the door
INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 64x xx
Terry peeks his head from around the corner into the room
Mick’s body is gone The room is empty but the water in the
bathroom is running
TERRY
Michael
(waits)
I’m not playing around Michael
He carefully enters the room He’s pretty scared
TERRY (CONTD)
What are you doing in there
The front door begins to close revealing Claire behind it
When it closes she locks it immediately
Terry jumps and turns around
TERRY (CONTD)
Good Lord- You sure startled me I
must have the wrong room
ANSEL (0S)
Hi Terry
Ansel is standing near the bathroom
TERRY

Ansel You didn’t answer our call
earlier today

Blue 90

TERRY (CONTD)
I told you to have the money for me
today and here you are screening my
phone calls- and I’m sorry but
that’s just plain rude I’m sick of
playin’ these games with you-
Makin’ me drive out all this way

Ansel takes a couple steps towards Terry

TERRY (CONTD)
Where’s my money Ansel
(beat)
And where’s Michael

ANSEL
He has moved on
TERRY
What is that supposed to mean
ANSEL
I’m not sure
Ansel motions to the floor beside the bed

Terry takes a step forward and sees Mick lying face down with
the handle of a phillips head sticking out of his head

TERRY

(crying)
Michael no

(to Ansel)
What have you done I wanted to
scare you that’s all this was Oh
God- Why did you have to go and
take it this far

Terry kneels down next to Mick and grabs his limp hand

TERRY (CONT’D)
He was an act--

ANSEL
Do you know what a fault is Terry
Blue 91

TERRY
This is your fault
ANSEL
A fault A fault
TERRY
What the heck are you talkin’
about
ANSEL

A fault is a fracture It’s a place
where pressure builds and builds
until it releases--

TERRY
Please just let me go I won’t
tell nobody about this- I swear

Ansel is in his own world The words are almost coming from
someplace else other than himself

ANSEL
But slowly after hundreds of
thousands and millions of years
something begins to grow from these
faults From these faults grow
mountains

TERRY
Why are you doing this This isn’t
like you It’s like you’re a
different person

It all makes sense to Ansel Everything makes sense now
He grabs a copy of his book from the TV Stand

ANSEL
Someday I will be a mountain but
for now I am a Fault

Ansel rushes towards Terry and strikes him across the face
with his book Blood flies from Terry’s mouth Ansel bashes
him with the book again knocking him to the ground He hits
him again and again and again

ANGLE ON Claire as she watches blankly
OFF SCREEN Ansel hammers Terry’s face in with the book We

don’t see any of this but it sounds horrible Ansel loses all
control
Blue 1A

He reaches a point where he can’t do it anymore completely
out of breath
Green 92

Every square inch of the book is stained with blood He drops
it on the ground and walks towards Claire who takes him into
her arms

CLAIRE
You did so good You did so good
Doesnt it feel right To just
listen Isn’t this easier than
thinking

They stand there in each other’s arms amongst the death and
destruction for a moment

CLOSE UP
on the book that Ansel used to bludgeon Terry to death It

has fallen open to the one of the first pages There signed
in black ink is

“To Claire I hope you find this
book useful in some way Cordially
yours Ansel Roth PhD

motel’s dumpster

EXT PENNY PINCHER MOTEL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 66

Ansel loads his suitcase and Claire’s things into his car He
gets in and starts it up Claire motions for him to roll down
the window He cranks it down

CLAIRE
I’ve forgotten something in the
room I don’t know how long I’1l1 be
but I want you to wait for me Are

ANSEL
What else am I going to do

We walk with Claire to the stairs up the stairs and down the
walkway to room 205 She opens the door letting light spill
into the room

Green 93

INT ROOM 205 - MOTEL - MORNING - CONTINUOUS O7KKKK

There’s a sheet on the floor over Terry’s body Claire closes
the door and walks past it and on her way to the bathroom

She comes out holding a tooth brush She walks towards us but
instead of going to the front door she goes to the door to

room 206 She opens her side but the door to room 206 is KKK
closed She knocks

It opens revealing Paul and Evelyn She walks into the room

INT ROOM 206 - MOTEL - MORNING - CONTINUOUS 68xxx

Claire hugs Paul then Evelyn

PAUL
How were we

CLAIRE
You both were amazing

Evelyn and Paul smile at each other They’re beaming

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Did you take care of him

EVELYN
Just making sure This was the
white one Not the colored fellow

CLAIRE
The man who struck me yes

PAUL

CLAIRE
God willed it

Evelyn and Paul nod in agreement

EVELYN
(re Ansel)
And is he

CLAIRE
He’s in the car

EVELYN
Oh that’s just wonderful I could
cry

CLAIRE
Out of everyone I chose you You
understand how special you are
don’t you Both of you I couldn’t
have done this without you

She grabs two cups from the table nearby and pours some water
from the sink into each of them

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Youve both reached the final
level How does it feel knowing
you’re about to move on

PAUL
I feel
(tearing up)
happy

EVELYN
Yes It’s very special I’ve never
felt this way before

Claire takes two pills out of her pocket and puts one in each
of their hands

CLAIRE
You have always been and will
always be with us We will see you
on the other side

Claire kisses Paul on the lips It’s like a boyfriend and
girlfriend saying goodbye at the airport knowing they won’t
see each other for a long time

Claire then kisses Evelyn in exactly the same way We see it
in Claire’s eyes that she is in fact quite sad

Both place the pill into their mouths Claire hands them
their water and they drink

EVELYN
With his knowledge your teachings
will continue to expand beyond
anything we ever could have
imagined

PAUL
Ira We love you

ClaireIra takes a step back and lets them lay down in their
respective beds

She waits until their eyes close then leaves the room

INTEXT ANSEL’S CAR - MOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING 69

on what’s happened only what is
