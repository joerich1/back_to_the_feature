A lot of money

IdAho
The desert in the daytime

MIKE enters the frame in front of a blue sky filled with white
clouds He has a Texaco gas station attendants shirt on with a
name tag that reads BILL (not Mike his name)

The clouds are puffy against a deep blue sky The road is red
Purple mountains surround Mike on all sides far in the distance
ten miles away Mike looks in front of him at a long stretch of
road that disappears into the horizon

Mike looks at his wristwatch on his arm He times how long it
takes to walk ten steps down the road

Ten seconds He glances back at a duffel bag The duffel bag
falls over

Mike looks at the picturesque sights surrounding him A wind
sends a tumbleweed into the air He takes ten steps back to his
duffle bag and checks watch again

The sun is now setting

MIKE
(to himself)
You can always tell where you are by
the way the road looks Like I Just
know that I been to this place
before I Just know that I been
stuck here like this one fuckin
time before you know that
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A JACKRABBIT IS LISTENING TO HIM

MIKE
There aint no other road on earth
that looks like this road I mean
exactly like this road (sniffs)
One of a kind (Sniffs) Like
someones face Like a fucked up
face

THE ROAD HAS A DEFINITE FACE TWO DISTANT CACTUS FOR EYES - A
CLOUD SHADOW FOR A MOUTH MOUNTAINS FOR HAIR

MIKE
Once you see it even for a
second you remember it and you
better not forget it you gotta
remember people and who they are
right Friends and enemies You
gotta remember the road and where
it is too

MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES AT THE LITTLE RABBIT LISTENING TO HIS CHAT
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE RABBIT RUNS FOR HIS LIFE

MIKE
I Just love to scare things I
dont know It gives me a sense
of Power

Mike thinks about the loneliness of the road

MIKE
This is nowhere Ill bet that
nobody is ever going to drive down
this road Ill be stuck here
forever

Mike looks at the road stressfully The road looks back He looks
at the road his eyes growing heavy The road looks back

Mikes yawns
MIKES VOICE OVER
I dont know when it was I

recognized I had this disease

Mike looks like a backwoods character who fits into the terrain
Mike makes strange movements like he is having a sort of
epileptic fit then yawns like he is very tired again

MIKES VOICE OVER
Sometimes Ill be in one place
and Ill close my eyes

MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES THEN A WHOLE RITUAL OF EVENTS HAPPENS HIS
EYES TURN BACK IN HIS HEAD AND HE BEGINS TO SHAKE ALL OVER THEN
ALL GOES BLACK

MIKES VOICE OVER
When I open them again Ill be in
a completely different
surrounding

When Mike opens his eyes he is in downtown PORTLAND OREGON

A LOUD BUS drives by Mikes view in the city He is asleep then
wakes enough to see other UNKNOWN KIDS rifling his pockets in a
doorway as Mike sleepily looks

on

SUBTITLES
Its kind of like time travel
Its kind of good

MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN AND WHEN HE OPENS THEM HE IS BACK IN
THE COUNTRY BUT THIS TIME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TERRAIN LIKE A
LONG TIME HAS PASSED HE IS ALSO WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES

MIKE CHECKS HIS WATCH AGAIN He looks happy at the passage of
time

MIKE
Yeah Its kind of good Passes
the time Unwanted as it is

MIKE LEANS AGAINST THE DUFFLE BAG WITH HIM HE LOOKS INTO THE
FIELD next to him The wind blows a paper cup into the air

Mike watches the cup tumble in the air and with a few notes a
GUITAR follows Then an uprooted cactus

The paper cup cactus and guitar lyrically trade places in the
air and are followed by a large barn which twists and turns
then crashes directly into the middle of the road

On the road Riding in the back of a pickup truck Mikes shirt
ruffles wildly in the wind traveling at 60 mph
And the truck disappears into the sun toward a steep mountain
range

LAS VeGAs

Mike is walking down a LONELY ALLEYWAY in the city ALL OF A
SUDDEN he is surrounded by three BLACK BOYS who are smiling and
joking

BLACK 1
SAY WHITE BOY where you goin

Black 1 pulls out a knife and waves it at Mike

BLACK 1
Whats in the sack Lets see

Mike fights with the guy for his sack The Black cuts Mikes
hands with his knife but Mike wont let go

In terror he watches his hands get cut but he wont let go Mike
starts to yawns and does the jitters to the Blacks amazement and
drops to the ground Scottie the older boy on the magazine
cover comes to Mikes aid He pushes the Black boy over throws
some trash cans in their direction

BLACK 1
This gonna be fun Come on

Scottie keeps fighting them off

SCOTT
Man what do you want from us we
havent got anything

The Blacks chuckle Then they stop and slowly walk away from
Scott who hovers protectively around Mikes body on the ground

BLACK (os)
Faggot

We are in the city of Las Vegas in the daytime (We are aware of
this because one character RAY is reading the Las Vegas
Chronicle) Mike sleeps as a shopkeeper washes his windows and
three other street kids Gary Ray and Scottie are hanging
around on the corner with him

Gary is hitting a public wastebasket with the end of a stick as a
MAN in a MERCEDES BENZ drives by them very slowly and looks at
each one of the boys individually Gary pauses for a moment and
poses

RAY
(to the man in the car) Whats up

MAN (in German)
Entschuldiging Junge

The man in the car speeds off
INT CAR DAY

THE MAN has the look of Rainer Fassbinder and Geraldo Rivera as
the same man is of average build and has a wash of hair gracing
his forehead that looks quite foreign He turns to the right
three times as he is circling his car

OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR we see the boys again
EXT STREET

GARY
Whats this guy want think he
wants to party

SCOTT
He said Entschuldiging Junge

GARY
Whats that mean Suck my dick
Does he want to suck my dick

SCOTT
It means Excuse me boys

GARY
How the fuck do you know

SCOTT
Ive studied German in prep
school

GARY
You know Scottie I dont know

when to believe you

SCOTT
Here he comes again
THE MAN leans out the window of his car

MAN
HELLO

Gary leans into the mans car

GARY
Hey dude
MAN
(speaks with a thick German

accent)
Excuse me Can I speak to the young
man over there with the blond hair
ya

GARY
Who that kid there You cant
talk with him now hes asleep

MAN
Can you wake him up

GARY
No you cant wake him he
but what about me Dont you want
to talk with me

The man is not interested in talking to Gary He shakes his head
no bothered by Gary

SCOTT
(speaking fluent German)
Was willist du in Gottesname mit uns
Juenge Mach es flar oder fanre
ab
(What in the hell do you want with
us young kids be specific or get

out)
MAN
(surprised)
Du bisst sehr intelligent mit deinem
Aksent Fuer elnen Puppejunge

(You are very clever with an accent
like that for a street boy)
THE MAN IN THE CAR SPEEDS OFF

GARY
Alright then asshole

VIEW of Mikes sleeping face

INSIDE OF MIKES thoughts He is flying over the city streets
above the Mercedes Benz effortlessly hovering and gilding above
it between the buildings Like a bird

Mike wakes and looks at Scottie who is talking to
Gary

MIKES THOUGHTS
The first time I met Scott I had
a feeling he was a sort of comic
book hero He was always saying
the right thing at the right
moment and standing up for me
when there was no reason to Look
at his face now when the sunlight
shines off his lower lip like it
is the face of some sort of
statue Strong and soft at the
same time I never could figure
out what Scott was doing here with
us on the street in the first
place like he was on some sort of
crusade to help the poor Because
he really did come from a rich
Portland family I know because he
brought me to his house one day
and showed me around I mean wow
they were rich I They even had a
swimming pool Scotts the only
kid that I had ever met that had a
swimming pool Id make a bet with
anybody right now that Scott is a
saint or a hero or some such
higher placed person

Meanwhile
Gary and Ray are talking Ray who is a Chicano street kid is
looking poetically off into the distance

RAY
My father was a gaucho But nobody
gonna find him He killed a guy
and split Nobody gonna find that
fuck I never gonna find him

Ray spits into the gutter and the spit drifts in a small stream
made by the shop-owner who was washing his windows down the

street and into drainage grating

View of MIKE as he closes his eyes oblivious to what is going on
around him

The music in a DISCO blares at night and all we can see is
Mikes face sleeping The disco MUSIC STOPS and the lights go
up

A broom passes by Mikes head
Finally THE MANAGERS SHOES appear at his head
MANAGER (0 Ss)
Whats wrong with him Passed
out

The shoes prod Mike

MANAGER (0 Ss)
Hey wake up

Mike wakes up in a WARD ROOM BED in the daytime

He looks around him The room has a lot of light windows
practically on all sides of the room There are other DETOX men
and women in other beds Mike gets up and starts to walk out but
he is wearing a gown

A nurse stops him

NURSE
Excuse me Are you all right

MIKE
Yeah Im fine

(Mike looks around the room)
NURSE

If youre going to leave us its
okay but we need you to sign out
and youll need to get your
clothes from downstairs

MIKE
Oh Yeah (he pauses and looks
around the place) Do you live

here

NURSE
Why no But sometimes I feel
like I do

The nurse walks him over to a clipboard on a desk Mike signs the
board and she gives him a receipt

MIKE
Whats this

NURSE

Thats Just a receipt if you
dont want it You can throw it
away Thats what most people do
with it

Then we cut to Mikes face at night As his eyes open he takes a
look around him a little dazed trying to figure where he is We
see he is under a store awning A lot of fog is rolling across
the street

A twenty-eight-year-old woman stops in a Mercedes Benz sedan
similar to the one that the German man was driving She motions
Mike to get inside the car

Dazed Mike looks at the car then responds
MIKE
This chick is living in a new car

ad

Inside a hallway entrance to the womans home Mike and the woman
take off their Jackets

MIKE
This is like a dream A pretty

woman never picks me up

Mike begins to caress her arm
LADY
They Dont Well I Dont see why
not

MIKE
Is this your house

LADY (caressing his head)
Yes

Mike follows the woman into her

Living room where sit Scottie and Gary on a plush sofa Mike sees
them

MIKE
Oh

Mike sits down in an easy chair next to the sofa

MIKE
Whats up Gary Scottie

GARY
HEY DUDE

LADY
You men make yourselves
comfortable and Ill be right
back Therere cokes in the
refrigerator - help yourself

They watch her go

SCOTTIE
Shes cool She Just likes to have
three guys cause - it takes her
a little while to get warmed up
Its normal Nothing kinky

MIKE
Oh

Mike looks around the room Gary leans closer to Mike

GARY
Hey did you get into that Van
Halen concert last night

MIKE
Ive never been to a concert
dude

Interior of the Womans bedroom Mike undresses He waits by the
side of the bed and takes a last drag on a

cigarette and puts it out Then the woman arrives lets down her
negligee and approaches Mike like an EARTH MOTHER slowly big
breasted warm comforting

As she approaches Mike begins to see a familiar face He is
upset when he looks into her eyes And he begins to
spasmodically shake then he grows sleepy and finally as she is
upon him he passes out

Outside Gary and Scottie struggle with Mikes body

They plop Mike down on the corner under a streetlight fold his
arms under his stomach and bend him over so he is sitting up
against the light pole

SCOTT
(putting money into his pocket) He
always does this Im surprised he
makes money at all

GARY
How do we tell if hes okay

SCOTT
Well hes not dead

Scott listens to his heart

SCOTT
Listen

Gary listens

SCOTT
Hes not dead Hes Just passed
out Its a condition Its called
narcolepsy

GARY
Scared the shit out of her What
causes it Sex
SCOTT
Stress Some hustler huh

Silence for a second

GARY
Where are we going to take him

Scott lifts Mikes body up and carries him to a soft carpet of
grass on the edge of a lawn Scott looks around to see if it is
okay Then he speaks to Mike even though he is asleep

SCOTT

Hey little brother You stay
here and when you wake up Just
come back into town Ill be there
waiting for you I figure youre
going to be safer here in this
comfy neighborhood than in the
city I grew up in a neighborhood
like this Itll be safe here

Scottie hides a tear Then he takes his Jacket off and puts it
over Mike then leaves him there

Mikes face is lying down with his nose pressed against a leafy
ground in the daytime

He wakes up stands makes his way up a slope and out to the
street He brushes himself off as the Mercedes Benz shows up
again Mike recognizes it and walks up to the window of the car
It is the MAN though not the lady The Man speaks with a German
accent - and he is about 35 years old HIS NAME IS HANS

MIKE
HANS
Say
Hans reads Mikes shirt

HANS
Say Bill Whats happening

Mike brushes himself off and walks down the road thinking that
the guy is weird
MIKE
Nothing much

Hans drives alongside Mike in his car

HANS
Do you want a lift Bill

MIKE
Hey isnt this the ladys car

HANS
Is Alena a friend of yours Shes
a friend of mine Any friend of
Alenas is a friend of mine Do
you want to be my friend

MIKE
Not really

HANS
Get in and Ill take you
someplace Yes Where do you want
to go

Mike doesnt respond and walks on
He pauses a moment and looks at the houses in the neighborhood
He looks down the street and can see Hans stopped in his car The

guy gets out and leans against the car

MIKE
This guy is a pervert I can tell

To Hans

MIKE
Go home

THE HOUSES LINE THE STREET EACH WITH A LITTLE CALIFORNIA STYLE
GARDEN MIKE CAN SEE ALL THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES LIFT OFF AND
THE FURNITURE INSIDE EACH HOUSE FLY OUT AND CIRCLE IN THE AIR
MIKE GETS THE JITTERS AND PASSES OUT

THE MERCEDES BENZ PULLS UP NEXT TO HIS HEAD WHICH IS NOW ON THE
GROUND

PORtLAnd
When Mike wakes up he is in Scotties arms They sit under a
statue in a park The statue is of two Indians pointing out
across the horizon and on the base of the statue is written The
Coming of the White Man

Mike looks at Scott and then at the new surroundings
At the Broadway Cafe Mike bites into a hamburger

MIKE
Howd we get home

SCOTT
That German guy Hans He brought
you downtown you were passed out
He said he was heading to
Portland so I asked him for a
ride

MIKE
I dont remember any German guy

SCOTT
Well You were sleeping

MIKE
How much do you make off me while
Im sleeping

SCOTT
Just a ride Mike I dont make
anything What you think that I
sell your body while you are
asleep

MIKE
Yeah

Scott sips from a coffee cup

SCOTT
No Mike Im on your side

He puts down the cup Mike knows Scottie always tells the truth
Mike is a little embarrassed that he has maybe offended Scotts
honor

MIKE
I was Just kidding dude
SCOTT
Garys up here somewhere He left
three days ago he flew up with
some John

MIKE
Exotic Have you seen your dad

SCOTT
Are you kidding

MIKE
Id visit my dad if he was here

SCOTT
I have to take care of you

MIKE
How about your mom

SCOTT

MIKE
That lady She looked like My
mother

SCOTT
Is that why you passed out

MIKE
Yeah I mean I dont know She
really looked like my mother I
must have been imagining things

A pause
The Broadway Cafe is beginning to pick up in business The table
where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window and it is

semi-circular in shape Scottie spies Gary across the street

He bounds up out of his chair and Mike watches him as he goes to
the door kicks it open and yells to Gary

SCOTT
HEY You dick

Gary sees Scott and runs across the street
Later in the BROADWAY CAFE there are other street kids hanging
around the table

Scott has his arm around a girl named DENISE who has a lot of
make up on and long stringy hair and who carries a teddy bear
Denise is crying and Scott is consoling her

MIKES THOUGHTS
It was almost as if Scott was on
some sort of crusade or mission
when you checked him out He
could make you feel good right at
the very time that you felt so
bad I remember there were many
times that I had been sobbing in
Scotts arms and he was helping me
out too He was the great
protector of us all and the great
planner He gave us hope in the
future Even though there was no
future There must have been real
trouble at home though for Scott
not to want to visit his father

Scott strokes Denises hair adoringly and gives her a kiss every
now and then

Mike looks across the table at CARL a skinny kid with black hair
and a large floppy sports cap and GARY who is talking with him

MIKES THOUGHTS
Thats Carl Hes always around
the Broadway he didnt run away
from home like a lot of these kids
did He had a mom and no dad at
least they didnt know where he
was And one day he came home to
the apartment where they lived
and there was no mom anymore
either He didnt know where she
went That was sir months ago

MARY an older wiser street prostitute who is chain smoking Kool
cigarettes

MIKES THOUGHTS
Thats Mary over there She was a
mean old chick She was maybe
thirty now Old old Somebody
once told me that in the past
Mary had this enemy a chick that
had turned her in And Mary had
gone off and kicked this chick to
death right in the street in front
of everybody I dont know if its
true but I watched out Just in
case I was afraid of Mary And
everyone else was too

Mary takes a drag from her cigarette and blows smoke in Mikes
face

Scott notices this But he attends to Denises problems

MIKES THOUGHTS

(as he coughs)

This was our little round table a
point around which everything else
revolved It was our center It was
like our home Our living room Not
everyone was the best of friends but
everyone knew everyone else and we
kind of stuck together

Mike on the street He watches as a man carrying a large bag of
tin cans crosses at a crosswalk Mike steps up to him and begins
walking His name is MARTY

MIKE
Hey Marty Whats goin on

MARTY
Is that you Mike Hey whats new
with you You look pretty good

MIKE
How many you got so far today

MARTY
I reckon that I picked up about
twenty-three bucks so far with
these cans and some I got stashed
back in the bushes You know the
old hiding place

MIKE
Wow
MARTY
Dont tell anybody though Just
between you and me You need a
place to stay

MIKE
I always need a place to stay
dude

MARTY

Yeah well Im under the bridge
You can Join me if you like

MIKE
Yeah I think Ill rooftop it
tonight Im hanging with a
friend

MARTY
Am I walking too fast for you

MIKE

No but Ill see you around See
you under the bridge

MARTY
Okay Mike

Mike stops walking with the guy and he splits down the street at
a fast clip

Inside the BROADWAY CAFE Mike smokes a cigarette at the round
table and watches Gary and Carl playing keepaway with Denises
teddy bear Denise is swearing using profanities that are
unusual for a girl

Night Mike walks through a dark wet troubled inner-city alley
and on the other side there is a parked car In the car sits a
man in his 40s bestial good looking but overweight He beeps
his car horn at Mike

Mike pauses lights a cigarette coolly and walks to the car and
leans in the window

MIKE
Hey - whats up
Int MOTEL nighttime

The man is naked in the background standing In front of a mirror
in a motel bathroom as Mike sits naked on a bed in front of a
tv set laughing at the show that is on

We see various still compositions of the two making love
Afield Day Two figures cross the field One is Bob Pigeon a

man in his fifties and the other his manservant Budd Because
of his girth Bob has problems crossing the field

BUDD
Jesus the things weve seen
do you remember a thing since we
moved from graffiti bridge

BOB
No more of that Budd

BUDD
Ha-ha what a crazy night

Above the two walking figures Gary wakes near a heating duct
atop a ten story building He yawns looks down at the street and

spies Bob and Budd

GARYS VIEW a tiny Bob and Budd are making their way across a
field

GARY
Hey Scottie here comes that fat
pig himself He owes me money

Scottie atop an adjacent building peeks his head over the edge
The two guys are relatively close to one another but far from the
street

SCOTT

Who
GARY

You know the fat one Pigeon
SCOTT

He stole my shoes the dick
GARY

Hey everybody here comes Bob the
chiseler

He yells to the other buildings and other street kids to wake up
Scottie pours an old paper cup of Coca-Cola over Bob and Budd
below

GARY
Look out its raining Coke

Bob hears the show atop the buildings
BOB
Ah I think my friends can see I

am back from Boise

Bob looks worried and happy at the same time not knowing if they
are friend or foe He shields himself from the Coke sprinkles

BOB
Do you see any clouds in the sky
Budd

BUDD
No Bob

The Derelict Hotel
Budd and Bob enter the threshold of a busted up but operating
hotel There is a fire in a trashcan turned upside down with
holes poked in it

Budd looks around the hotel

BUDD
Is Jane Lightwork alive Bob

BOB
Shes alive Budd

BUDD
Is she holding on

BOB
Old old Budd
BUDD
She must be old she has no
choice

THE TWO sit at a larger fire deeper into the derelict hotel

BUDD
I remember her daughter she died
years ago of old age She must

be old all right That was before
I came to Clements Inn

BOB
(warming by the fire)
Ahh

BUDD

BOB

of the tunnel

BUDD
That we have that we have in

things that weve seen

Scott drinks from a beer can inside the derelict
to a young boy laughs wipes his mouth and puts
cigarette into the mouth of Gary making his way
through a circle of girls kisses Denise who we
the Broadway Cafe and charges up the steps

Inside the hotel on a staircase landing Scottie

SCOTTIE OPENS A DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WALKS INTO A
ROOM INTERRUPTING MIKE WHO STANDS OVER BOBS SNORING BODY

Mike coolly holds up a wad of bills and a folded envelope of
cocaine

MIKE
I picked his pocket

SCOTTIE
(whispering)

What did you get dude
MIKE
Just this
Scottie takes the cocaine from him sits down at the foot of the
bed and begins to unfold the packet Bob turns in the bed and the

rush of air from the sheets blows the white powder out of the
packet

BOB
What the hell
Mike laughs
BOB
What time is it son

SCOTTIE
(climbing in bed with Bob)
What do you care

Bob dazed is looking around himself like he is being had

SCOTTIE
(amusing Mike)
Why you wouldnt even look at a
clock unless hours were lines of
coke dials looked like the signs of
gay bars or time itself was a fair
hustler in black leather isnt
that right dude
Bob staggers out of bed retching and spitting Then back into his
waking stupor feeling something is being put over on him

SCOTT
Theres no reason to know the
time We are timeless

Bob checks his wallet

BOB

arms She is very old

JANE

peace in my house

Scott and Mike laugh Mike gets down on his hands and knees and
tries to scoop up a little cocaine from the floor

Bedroom

Hall
JANE

Another hall

Bob is storming down it in a rage people opening doors of the
rooms

BOB

Yet another hall

Hotel dwellers are watching Jane move down the hall answering
Bob

JANE

MAIN derelict hall of the hotel

Bob parades in his night clothes in front of a gathering of
outcasts in the hotel

BOB
This hotel is full of thieves
Junkies

JANE
You are the thief

BOB
They picked my pocket

LAUGHTER from the throngs of outcasts Jane enters a balcony
overlook of the main hall Mike and Scott enter arms around each

other laughing

JANE
Its impossible to board a dozen
or so men and women who live
honestly and have the others live
like Junkies
One of the dwellers listening to the argument is shooting up as
they speak We see a close view of the needle and Bob running
around in the background

Bob makes his way next to Scott

BOB
You have corrupted me Scottie I
was an innocent before I met you
and now look at me just a
little better than wicked I used
to be a virtuous man

Scottie is laughing at him

BOB

Scottie laughs

good son all along All the past

vacation At least it wasnt as
boring as schoolwork All my bad
behavior Im going to throw away to
pay my debt I will change when
everybody expects it the least

Scott turns and leaves

BOB
And you will become a hard roller
a hatchet man for your old man

Scott laughs to himself because he knows Bob is misunderstanding
him Bob is part of the past life that he says he is going to
throw away

SCOTT
No You will be the hatchet man

there will rarely be a job

Inside the Broadway Cafe Day

Denise and Mike hang out together Both are smoking cigarettes
which have made a billow of smoke that hangs over the table that
is in the front window

DENISE

Public bathroom Night

Mike empties the contents of his pockets at a bathroom sink He
has in his possession One condom One comb with blond hair stuck
in it One nickel Half a stick of gum One knife with the letter
W stamped on it

He arranges these things in a neat order on the surface of the
sink while a man flushes a toilet in the background and uses
another sink Mike is quite at home here He takes his time
arranging the articles and washing his hands He looks over at
the man washing his hands and gives him a friendly smile

The man leaves Mike puts all the things on the sink into his
pockets Then he walks over to a urinal unzips his fly and

starts to take a leak A shadow opens the door in back of him
and without turning around Mike senses the presence of a man

Alleyway Night

large belly with medallions around the neck

SCOTT
How long has it been Bob since

BOB
About four years Scottie Four

Scottie laughs Bob waddles along the side of the alleyway
stepping on a curb then in a pothole losing his balance Another
accomplice whistles from atop a building We SEE the group of
ROCK AND ROLL promoters

Bob walks further from Mike and Scottie
SCOTTIE
If they escape from you well get

Bob struggles as he walks
BOB
Eight feet of cobblestones is like
30 yards of flat road with me
Mike and Scott run off laughing at him
BOB

BUDD
Jesus will you shut up And keep

Budd sees the promoters coming and waves to Bob as he lies down
on the ground

BUDD

BUDD
Lie down and stay quiet until
they round the corner and well
ambush them

BOB
Have you got a crane to lift me up

Budd laughs

MIKE

Down the way the rock and roll promoters are approaching having
no knowledge of the buffoonery at the other end of the tunneling
alleyway They are drunk

VICTIM 1
Come along neighbor Tommy will
lead the way Ive lost track of
time (burp)
At the other end of the alley

Bob and three others are marching in procession chanting a
facsimile of Rashneesh but a bad act

The rock promoters approach smashing a bottle

VICTIM 1
Who are these jokers

VICTIM 2
Rashneesh listen
VICTIM 1
Theyre chanting

Scottie and Mike hide behind garbage cans laughing
The rock promoters circle the group of chanting Rashneesh

VICTIM 3
I thought that all you Rashneesh
had up and left

Victim 1 pours a beer on one of their heads Just as he does this
Bob pulls out two long pistols almost heavy enough that he
cannot hold them straight barrels parallel

BOB
Aha One move and Ill blow you
away you sully scumbags up
against that wall

One of the victims falls down and begins to run away One of
Bobs men starts after him A lockbox that he was carrying falls
to the ground Bob spies it

BOB
No Let him go

Bob aims one pistol at the running figure as he keeps the others
against the wall with the other pistol He fires three times One
of Bobs boys grabs the lockbox

A VIEW of the running figure bullets cutting around him

BOB
Look at him go

VICTIM 2
Dont shoot us

Bob winks at the lockbox and shoots the gun in the air

All the rock promoters go running Bob charges after them firing
the gun twice more in the air then once at the lockbox breaking
it open

BOB
The valise is open Lets see what
we got
Mike and Scottie hiding behind trashcans

SCOTTIE
Where are our disguises

Mike runs to his stash and finds two large capes and large hats
They put these on

Bob finds wads of money and receipts

BOB
Ticket anyone To next weeks
show

He throws these on the ground and the boys fall over themselves
for the tickets Bob wads the money and puts it back in the box
laughing to himself

Mike and Scottie sneak closer to the group still hiding long
flowing capes concealing their identity

BOB
Scott and Mike have disappeared
did the shots scare them away

They sneak closer Mike lights a big firecracker and waits

BOB
-maybe we should get the hell
out of here But are they such
chickens

A LOUD EXPLOSION

Mike and Scottie disguised jump out with large silver baseball
bats swinging them and making as much noise as they can
knocking over a set of garbage cans flashing flashlights into
Bob and the others eyes

Frightened Bob drops the lockbox and runs the others follow
Mike and Scottie hitting them with the bats as they go

BOB
Get the box Oh Fuck

Mike swings the bat at Bob it grazes the side of a building and
sparks fly from it Bob wheezes from the run
Scottie chases the others in the same direction

They stand kicking garbage cans and watching them run
convulsing with laughter

SCOTTIE
The thieves scatter

MIKE
Bob Pigeon will sweat to death

SCOTT

Mike suddenly begins to shake and falls asleep

Scottie picks up the envelope from his father and puts it in his
pocket

Mike and Scott are stuck on a long straight road in the desert
Mike is angry at Scott because he doesnt think he knows how the
motorcycle works

Scott is trying again and again to start the engine

MIKE
Come on

SCOTT
Shut up Mike

He tries to turn it over again

SCOTT
If I had known that it was going
to be this hard to start then I
wouldnt have stopped it at all

Mike looks at the road and the surrounding area It is the same
road that he was stuck on in the beginning

MIKE
Scott I just know that I have
been on this road before

Mike stares at the face in the road Two cactus for eyes
mountains for hair a cloud shadow forms the mouth over a red
nose road with a dotted line running down it

At night Scott and Mike sit next to a fire they have made on the
side of the road We can hear Indians in the distance dancing

and chanting a song

MIKE
It sure is lonely out in the
desert

SCOTT
Yeah I guess

MIKE
If I had had a normal family and
a good upbringing then I would
have been a well adjusted person
But somehow that just didnt work
out

SCOTT
Depends on what youd call
normal —-

MIKE
Well normal you know with a mom
and a dad and a dog and shit like
that normal

SCOTT
So you didnt have a dog Or you
didnt have a dad

MIKE
I didnt have a dog and I didnt
have a dad Well not a normal
dad

The music is getting louder It sounds like a war chant

MIKE
Hey Scott

SCOTT
What

Mike is hesitating He is about to say something personal

looks at Scott and back to the fire a few times too many

SCOTT
What Mike

MIKE
Oh Have you ever Uh

Scott is getting Mikes drift Mike rubs his crotch

He
MIKE
I mean dont you ever get horny

SCOTT
Yeah But

MIKE
Oh yeah not for a guy

SCOTT
Mike Two guys cant love each
other They can only be friends
An awkward moment passes where Mike is looking away from Scott
and Scott cant help but look at Mike Then Scott catches Mikes
eye and motions for him to come closer to him
Mike walks over to Scott and Scott holds him in his arms

Overhead VIEW of the two in front of the campfire

SCOTT
I only have sex for money

Mike starts to get out some money

SCOTT
I cant take your money

A pause

SCOTT
But we can be close friends

The next morning Mike is sleeping As he opens his eyes he can
see Scott still trying to start the motorcycle

Mike stands and looks down the road at an approaching State

Police Car Mike afraid of the police starts to move into the
bushes

Scott is out of breath trying to start the bike

MIKE

Scott looks in the direction of the police car
SCOTT
Looks like this is it

MIKE
Yeah

Scott hits the side of the gas
his hand

SCOTT

tank of the bike with the palm of

Cant get the bike started Cops

nowhere with a stolen bike Yeah
Mike Looks like this is the end

The policeman pulls up to them and parks

The policeman sits in his car

for a second and reports into the

radio then he gets out and walks over to the boys

Mike gets scared and runs into

The cop stands and watches Mi
into an open desert

the desert

ke has nowhere to go he is running

The policeman a full blooded American Indian seems amused at
his power He looks at Scott then back at Mike who trips in the

desert and falls in a cloud of

COP

dust

Whats the matter with him

SCOTT

I dont know I guess he doesnt

like cops

COP
Yeah
SCOTT
Thats how it looks

COP
What are you kids doing

SCOTT
This cycle is one bitch

about motorcycles You arent a
motorcycle cop

COP

Scott walks through the desert looking for Mike where he dropped
He picks him up out of the dirt spit dripping from his sleeping
lips and smacks him in the face

SCOTT
Wake up Mikey the heats off

Mike will not wake up
When Mike wakes up He is inside a TRAILER at night

Scott is eating sandwiches to his right that are on a little TV
tray

There is MIKES BROTHER leaning into him on his left He looks at
Mike offensively His brother is very good looking but looks
like he has lost his mind somewhere down the line Which is why
he lives in the desert in a trailer away from people

SCOTT
Look Mike Sandwiches

BROTHER

woman She used to be so proud of
you you know she would just

beam And not Jim Beam either If

drive for hours to get a look at
you I remember what was it
eighteen years ago

MIKE
Twenty-one

BROTHER
Is that how old you are now I
thought you wuz younger than

wasnt proud that you had to live
in an institution mind you but
all the same when I would look at
you all the institutional walls
would come down and we were a
family Your mom me and you God

Mike is getting visibly upset Scott gets up to go to the
bathroom

Inside the bathroom night

Scott enters and notices a velvet portrait of a woman hanging on
the wall Off screen Scott can hear Mike and his Brother

MIKE (os)

unexpectedly deep and loud that
Scott is startled) Shut your

His brother hits the table with a crash
Living room night

Anyway You were maybe not in the
biological sense my brother but in
our business (holds his
hands up in the air) And If Im not

Scott enters from the bathroom

He holds his head down

Scott looks around the trailer at all the velvet portraits
hanging on the walls

takes it counting it out for himself

Mike walks around a corner of the house and notices the doors are
open as the cab drives off down the drive

into the house

An extremely Beautiful Italian girl walks around the corner where
Scott is sitting He cant see her And she leans against the
shack and stares at him then looks up at Mike who is walking
through the house trying to find someone

and he is crying He is talking to Scottie who is holding him

MIKE

Mike walks through the rooms of the Italian country

MIKES VIEW of a room and Scott is just closing the door He
winks at Mike as he shuts it

Inside the room Carmella and Scott lay down on the bed and kiss

Scott takes off his clothes and ravishes Carmella tearing at her
dress

Carmella is naked and the two grab and twist with each other on
the white bed

Still views of the lovemaking
Mike in the country watching the farmer in the field

Mike approaches the house and there is a taxi cab waiting
Carmella is putting a suitcase in the trunk

Scott helps Carmella in the front seat of the taxi

SCOTT

for a second

Scott follows Mike inside the house and into a room

SCOTT

Scott gives Mike an American Express card

SCOTT
Dont leave home without it Ha-

funny)

down the road

Mike is shocked but sees what Scott needs to do as he looks out
the window and can see Carmella in the taxi

MIKE

Outside a dog watches the taxi leave down a rutted dirt drive

MIKES THOUGHTS
Well So much for the great
protector-of-us-all Protector of
himself more like I couldnt
believe Scott would leave me here
in the middle of a foreign
country

Inside Mike goes into one of his fits snorting a little like a
pig and falls asleep

PoRtland

Mike wakes up in an airlines passenger seat A STEWARDESS is
leaning over him
STEWARDESS

INT BROADWAY CAFE in the day

around the table
MIKE

And so I was back in Portland

Ext street night

Cars cruise by Mike is on a street corner He hops into a
strangers car

Int MOTEL night
Still views of Mike having sex with a date
MIKE
and I enjoyed the fruits of my
labor
CLOSE VIEW of money exchanging hands
BROADWAY CAFE day

Mike is at the table again smoking a cigarette

There are three new kids who look very MEAN and are hassling
another kid pulling his collar and throwing him around

MIKES THOUGHTS
And there were new kids who were
coming around who wanted to take
your money It was a dark period
for the streets Normally Scott
would keep order In the Broadway
Cafe

A Hot dog stand Gary cheerfully prepares Mike a hot dog

MIKES THOUGHTS
Gary and Ray both got work at
stands It was funny

Int Deli day
Ray serves Mike a hot dog

MIKES THOUGHTS
( they both sold hot dogs Which
is what they were used to selling
on the streets in the old days
These guys had really changed I
thought

Mikes FACE outdoors in the daytime

He looks out on the cityscape

The buildings of the city uproot and tumble in the air
Jakes restaurant night

Mike wakes up He is sitting next to Bob and Budd A new friend
a colorfully dressed man named BAD GEORGE who looks like a
street minstrel talks on the street in front of a fancy
restaurant Bad George is obnoxiously yelling in Bobs face

BAD GEORGE
Bob What tidings I bring you And
such joy Some of that old rot gut
that you and I used to drink I
have three bottles stashed in the
bushes out on eighty-second

BOB
What blew you in

BAD GEORGE
Think of the fun we can have if
we could only rind a ride fora
journey to the bushes where the
hooch is hid

BOB
If I shared your wine I might
catch this awful disease you
appear to have My clothes would
turn striped and I would suddenly
have bells on my toes like this
here

Bob points to Georges bells on his shoes

BAD GEORGE
Bob youre one of the greatest
living men on Three-street

BOB
That is correct

BAD GEORGE
Surely you can find us a ride
somewhere

MIKES THOUGHTS

As I listened to Bad George and
Bob talk I watched across the
street as a long black car pulled
up alongside one of the fancier
restaurantbar establishments of
Portland And who got out of that
car It was the old protector-of-
us-all himself Scottie Favor

Bob notices the group of men getting out of a car in front of the
restaurant One of them is Scottie in a three pieced suit He
is with his Italian girlfriend

BOB
If it isnt Scottie Favor himself
Blessed are they who have been my
close friends Now dressed in a
three pieced suit and looking
every bit a gentleman He has run
into his inheritance

BAD GEORGE
Who
BOB
George Budd Mike We have waited
for this day to come

Bob charges in the direction of Scottie and his friends
Int Jakes Night

Scottie and his associates who are men much older than he
perhaps in their thirties make their way through the yuppie
crowd standing in the bar drinking Hellos and how-do-you-dos
are directed at Scottie A man stops Scott on his way through the
crowd

MAN
Scottie I havent seen you ina
dogs age Youre looking well So
grown up Scottie Id like you to
meet Ed Warren hes in marketing
at Nike Ed this is Scottie
Favor

ED
Oh Jack Favors son hello
pleased to meet you

SCOTTIE
How do you do

Bob is following Scottie through the crowd Scottie walks past
Hans who is having a drink with another man They recognize each
other but neither speak

Bob with Bad George in tow straightens himself up as the yuppie
crowd looks on disapprovingly Their smelly clothing betrays
them

BOB
Come George watch this You will
see the attention that I get

Bob looks at his clothes A bouncer spots them

BOB
Its true were drawing attention
to ourselves But Scottie will see
that I am dying to see him and it
wont matter how were dressed
Scotty and his friends are sitting around a crowded table As
they take their seats Scottie hears Bob bellowing

VIEW of Bob being detained by the bouncer
BOB
God save you God save you my
sweet boy

Scotty turns away from Bob so his back is to him

BOB
Sonny My true friend

Silence for a second the crowd grows quieter

BOB
I mean you Sonny Its me Bob

Without turning toward Bob Scottie speaks

SCOTT
I dont know you old man

GIRL IN CROWD
Who is that bum

Scottie turns and meets Bob who kneels next to him

SCOTTIE
Please leave me alone

Bob is thinking that Scotties attitude is a joke
SCOTTIE
Dont think that Im the same
Scottie that I was before
Everyone has noticed that I have
turned away from that life and
the people who kept me company
Bob is shocked

Outside Mike can see through the windows of the restaurant Bob
and Scottie talking

Int Jakes night

SCOTTIE
When I was young and you were my
street tutor An instigator for my
bad behavior I was trying to
change Now that I have and until
I change back dont come near
me

Bob feels the rejection like a shock Stares at Scott for a
second then hes pulled away by the bouncer

Ext Jakes night
Mike watches Bob and Budd sit down with him

BUDD
Dont take all this seriously
Its one of his jokes

Nighttime overhead view of Bob in his greasy derelict hotel bed
He is having nightmares and suddenly he CRIES OUT

BOB
God God God

Dawn views of the city
Mike awakes atop a downtown building
Inside the Derelict Hotel Day

Mike enters and walks through a very quiet although crowded
MAIN ENTRANCE There is a body on a slab in the middle of the
room that is covered with a sheet

MIKE
Pigeon

A BOY
Scottie Favor broke his heart

GARY
Hes gone now either to Heaven or
to Hell

JANE LIGHTWORK
Be sure it isnt to Hell He tried
to be an honest sort Im the one
who heard him cry out last night
He said God God God three or
four times And when I got there I
put my hand into the bed and felt
his feet And they were cold as
stone And I checked the rest of
his body And it too was as cold
as stone

BUDD
(crying)
It sure is quiet

Mike approaches Budd

MIKE
I guess youre gonna miss him the
most Budd

Mike gives him Scotties American Express card as others carry
his body out of the hotel
Dawn views of the city

MIKE
Here Maybe you can give hima
good burial

Budd cries
Mike exits
In the country Mike looks at the road

He has visions of sagebrush and rock flying into the air as if
picked up by a big wind

Then he lies asleep by the side of the road

MIKES VOICE
I suppose that a lot of kids like
me think that they have no home
that home is a place where you
have a mom and a dad

Pause

MIKES THOUGHTS
But home can be any place that you
want Or wherever you can find
My home is right here on the side
of this road that I been to
before I just know I been on this
fucking road one time before you
know that

Later a car drives by Mikes sleeping body by the side of the
road It turns around and stops next to Mike A figure puts Mike
in his car and drives off down the road

MIKES THOUGHTS

Sometimes I had thought that God
had not smiled on me and had
given me a bum deal And other
times I had thought that God had
smiled on me Like now He was
smiling on me for the time
being

Int Car Day
Scott is driving the car He looks over at Mike sleeping
Ext Desert Day

The car disappears down the road
