doesn’t want to be alone The fear is creeping up on her
again She hears noises through out the house

She hears a springy sound come from the cabinet behing her
She turns to it

In a flash something bursts toward her out of the hamper two
seall abhorrent KLOWN JACK IN THE BOXES with dripping
snapping jaws

Debbie jumps backwards barely evading the slashing fangs
She slams into the sink immediately the medicine cabinet
bursts open and another JACK IN THE BOX creature lunges

This one digs it’s teeth into Debbie’s shoulder She screams
but the thing is amazingly strong and she can’t free herself
She struggles in agony to reach the aerosol can on the
counter

Just as she is about to grab it a second kiqwn leaps from
the cabinet and bites into her shoulder She falters for a
moment

of the klowns They release her and emit an unearthly shriek
and spring wildly about in agony

Debbie slams the cabinet doors closed on them The hamper
klowns hop toward her She kicks the hamper and it falls in
front of the door Her escape is blocked by the HAMPER
KLOWNS She laoks for another escape

Slowly behind her the toilet lid begins te open Rising
menacingly behind her is a larger even sore gruesome JACK IN
THE BOX DEMON

It snarls revealing its corroded dripping fangs It recoils
on its spring like some huge cobra preparing to strike

Debbie whirls around and comes face to face with the thing
Tt lunges She falls backwards into the tub

The thing snaps at her She cowers back looks up and sees
the shower massager

It snaps at her again She cowers back

With lightning speed Debbie grabs the massager and shoves it
down the things throat

She reaches for the faucets and turns the shower on

The force of the water whips the creature around wildly

She grabs the shower curtains runs at the creatures pdlocking
her exit throws the curtains over them and leaps out the
door

mouth

juices of the victims encased in the coccons UHHGG The

burps
