FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA

INT JACK’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Were close on something too close it’s blurry and
confusing

We hear the voice of MIRANDA Hodgkins 24 It’s meek and
sweet soothing with the unmistakable sing-song lilt of a
french accent

MIRANDA (0S)
Jack Jack wake up

The camera pulls back slightly revealing
JACK Fisk 26 anemic pale heavily tattooed kind of hot
actually in his way He’s wrapped in a ratty stained

blanket mostly asleep

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
Hello baby

JACK
What

MIRANDA (0S)
Tell me you love me

JACK

What
(waking up)
Oh what get that out of my face-

Jack pushes the camera away but Miranda flops down next to
him giving another close up

MIRANDA (0S)
No Tell me you love me

JACK
That’s not what we bought that for

MIRANDA (0S)
So Do it it’1ll make me happy
JACK
Okay
(beat)
I love you

MIRANDA (0S)
It worked That made me happy

INT JACK’S KITCHEN - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Jack shirtless is making breakfast The kitchen is dingy
and run down a low rent house Outside through the window
we can see palm trees west coast it must be

The camera tracks his movements from the kitchen table

JACK
So are you the new Andrew Detmer

MIRANDA (0S)
Jack that’s horrible

JACK
I’m just saying I don’t know if
we need documentation that I suck
at making bacon

MIRANDA (0S)
Aw you don’t suck-

JACK
(burnt by popping grease)
Ah SHIT

Miranda laughs

INT JACK’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The camera is doing something very weird it’s extremely
close to the dirty carpeting moving somewhat jerkily as
though tracking something

But there’s nothing just carpet

MIRANDA (0S)
You can see- I don’t know if it’s
picking it up-
(loudly )
Jack Jack

Jack appears now dressed for work at some fast food chain
looking nervously down at Miranda behind the camera
Blue (mmddyyyy) 3

JACK
What’s up

MIRANDA (0S)
Look

JACK
»-I don’t see anything

MIRANDA (0S)
The bugs

JACK
What bugs

MIRANDA (0S)
There are little red- you see them
the little red spiders I can see
them on the camera

There’s a moment of silence and we look back to Jack He’s
clearly concerned

JACK
There’s no bugs babe

MIRANDA (0S)
You have to look closer you can-

JACK
Did you take your meds today

Miranda’s silence speaks volumes
JACK (CONTD)
Did you Cause you’re not coming
out tonight if you didn’t take your
meds you know that right-
The camera abruptly cuts out
CLOSE ON
A rumpled polaroid faded and old showing a pretty young
girl standing with another girl her age a sister Miranda

points to the girl with her finger

MIRANDA (0S)
See that’s me thenand

We pull back to reveal we’re in

JACKS BATHROOM
Equally dingy and punk-rock as the rest of the place

MIRANDA (CONTD)
This is me now

MIRANDA Hodgkins 24 petite elfin almost mouselike with
the camera up to her face looks back at us from the mirror

This is a person fallen into disrepair She clearly was once
beautiful but her hair has gone ratty and tangled her skin
pallid and sallow black-bagged eyes skinny and frail

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Ugh That’s not good

CUT

Moments later Miranda is straightening her hair She’s
talking but it’s with a weird almost too fast cadence the
unmistakable babble of a schizophrenic

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I figure I can record everything
and file it away and then I’1ll have
it for reference about the bugs or
my various projects the things
we’re working on or the thing in
the basement and we’ll be able to
see an all-oneness be established
between each different thread of my
life-

CUT
Miranda is gently applying eyeliner

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Beautiful Beautiful movie-star

It’sbetter Beautiful movie-star is a stretch

INT JACK’S HOUSE - MIRANDA’S EDITING CLOSET

The camera has been set down haphazardly on a table and we
can see Miranda lit only in the blue light from monitors

From the monitors we hear a familiar voice

ANDREW DETMER (ON MONITOR)
There’s this thing called an Apex
Predator and basically what that
is is the most powerful predator in
an ecosys-
Blue (mmddyyyy) 5

She pauses it

MIRANDA
You can see here he looks really
crazy

She picks up the camera filming the screen where we see
Andrew Detmer sitting in the junkyard she’s on some kind of
editing program

MIRANDA (0S) (CONT’D)
Yeah This part is important
This part is really important

INT JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

We cut in and see Miranda’s workshop for the first time
it’s INCREDIBLY CLUTTERED with tools bits and pieces of
technology heavy machinery and circuit boards

It looks like some kind of hoarding disorder packrat
nightmare Miranda sits tinkering with something blow-
torching the side of it wearing a protective mask

MIRANDA
(muttering)
There we go There we go

VERY SUDDENLY the object she’s working on LOUDLY WHIRS AND
ROTATES RAPIDLY causing a clusterfuck of falling objects in
the room

CUT

Miranda now stands near to the camera holding with some
effort a giantwhat is that She is proudly showing it
off whatever it is

MIRANDA (CONTD)
This is number seven but it’s
actually the tenth one I’ve built
there were the three for the
prototype

She presses a button and the chambers on the long
cylindrical device begin to rotate rapidly with a distinct
VRRRM sound Miranda smiling shouts over the noise

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Eight hundred rounds a minute
Blue (mmddyyyy) 6

Dear god It’s a gattling gun

SLAM TO

INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

The music is loud the lights are colorful Jack’s on stage
we’re in the audience Jack’s singing “Holiday In Cambodia”
by the Dead Kennedys Totally killing it

CUT

Miranda’s on stage she’s awkward out in front of people but
getting a little bit into it “Linger” by the Cranberries

CUT

More drinks Laughing

EXT SANTA MONICA PIER - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

Jack sits on the ferris wheel next to Miranda beyond him a
cursory view of the pier the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica
at night

Were close on Jack drinking from a brown paper bag

JACK
I’ve reconsidered my stance on you
filming

MIRANDA (0S)
Oh yeah

JACK
Yeah I think it’s a good idea
But you know why you’re doing it
right

MIRANDA (0S)
Because if we have video of every
part of my life I can show people
what’s real and what’s not real and-

JACK
No haha okay no

MIRANDA (0S)
What
Blue (mmddyyyy) 7

JACK
Youre disassociating World’s
easier to take when you’re looking
at it on a little screen

CUT

JACK (CONTD)
But I do think it’s a good idea
It’1ll humanize us after the fact
It’1ll show people who we were

Jack smiles at Miranda behind the camera

MIRANDA (0S)
You look handsome

JACK
Oh shut up-

CUT

Miranda leans in filming herself and on the ferris wheel
they kiss

INT JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

The camera’s been set up on a tripod filming Miranda working
on some sort of big bulky thing of metal gears and wires
it sort of looks like an arm

She presses a button and- whoa- it flexes almost
organically She smiles at the camera pleased with her
handiwork and then her cell phone rings

CUT
Miranda’s off-screen talking on the phone

MIRANDA
How did you get this numberNo
I don’t care I DON’T CARE LEAVE
ME ALONE I don’t want- I DON’T
WANT TO SEE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE
LEAVE ME ALONE

Miranda hurls the phone offscreen it hits something and
there’s the sudden sound of electric whirring- VRMMM-

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Oh shit-
Blue (mmddyyyy) 8

Something opens fire in the basement causing INSTANT
ANARCHY bits of broken machinery flying everywhere blue
light oscilating brightly from something off screen as the
camera is tipped over onto its side and-

We see Miranda scrambling to a plug-in generator

MIRANDA (CONTD)
Shit shit shit

She yanks out the plug and the mayhem ceases just as
abruptly as it started

Miranda wild-eyed looks around and then scrambles over to
the camera turning it off

INT JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

It’s storming outside we can hear rain spattering against
the roof and the occasional sound of thunder

Jacks sitting and watching TV Miranda hurrying in to film
him as he beckons her

JACK
Is it on Do you- okay good
look Look

MIRANDA (0S)
At the TV-

JACK
Yes Look

Miranda gets closer to the television filming it It’s
showing some kind of news program The BROADCASTER is
accompanied as always by footage and photographs backing up
everything she says

BROADCASTER
Our top story today another
sighting of “The Flying Man” this
time from all the way in the
Indonesia in the Borneo province
of Kalimantan

JACK
Cmon Matt where you at now

We see an interview with a local Indonesian man out on a
bridge He speaks but is spoken over by a translator

Fe

Blue (mmddyyyy) 9

INDONESIAN MAN (TRANSLATOR)
The bridge shook and started to
collapse We were all very scared
and then we saw him He went very
fast

We see that there’s a huge pile of cars over behind him

INDONESIAN MAN (CONT’D)
He took the cars from the bridge
and put them in a big pile He was
very careful He saved many lives

Back to the reporter where we see several blurryy
photographs displayed

JACK
Really The three pictures again
jesus christ

BROADCASTER
-the seventh such sighting in nine
months since the Seattle
Catastrophe

They cut to show a government press conference led by

Bruce HANSON late 40s his suit a little worn down The man
is all hard edges the almost prototypical man in black bad-
ass the faceless hands of the system calloused and
intimidating

HANSON
At this time the United States
Government would like to restate
that while details of what
happened in Seattle on the night of
February 4th are still unclear
there is a prioritized ongoing
investigation by both Homeland
Security and the Central
Intelligence agency-

JACK
This guy Look at him lying this
is him this is one of the guys

MIRANDA
Jack calm down-

JACK
They’re protecting him always
why WHY What’d he do to earn
this

BROADCASTER
As always more on this story as it
develops Senate Republicans made
waves today when-

JACK
You motherf- you- you-

He rips the TV from the wall smashing it on the floor then
hurls the remote into the wall before kicking over the
coffee table dozens of beer bottles shattering on the floor

MIRANDA (0S)
Jack Jack stop

CUT

Jack is sitting on the couch huffing and puffing he looks
completely over the edge

JACK
Did you see that Two minutes at
the start of the show “oh the
government doesn’t know anything

LET’S LEAVE IT ALONE NO MIRANDA
it’s BULLSHIT They don’t care
NOBODY CARES-—

MIRANDA (0S)
I know I just-

JACK
Is your edit done

MIRANDA (0S)
I almost there are-

Jack suddenly stands up advancing on her it’s not
aggressive but it’s damn sure intimidating and Miranda has
to back up this frames her holding in the camera in a
mirror

She looks small and helpless in the wake of Jack’s fury

JACK
Is it done or isn’t it done

MIRANDA
I- I don’t know- I’m trying I-

JACK
Is it done Is it done Is it
done-

FF HH

Jack snatches the camera away from her filming himself

JACK (CONTD)

DIGITAL
DISTORTION CRASH
TO BLACK

FROM AIELLO’s CAMERA

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

It’s pouring down rain Currently we’re in a car driving up
to a clearing lit only by headlights For a moment the
camera shows

Mike AIELLO a young CIA agent with a round friendly face
before it’s spun around and raised to reveal

Hanson Yep the guy from TV He’s driving clearly deep in
thought

HANSON
You keep it on no matter what You
don’t engage you let me talk

AIELLO
You talked to him before right

HANSON
Once or twice It’s okay to be
nervous but he’s just a kid You
don’t put him on a pedestal you
don’t defer to him on anything
Were in the middle of a massive
security breach can I trust you to
keep it together

AIELLO
Yes sir

MOMENTS LATER

e FF FH

Blue (mmddyyyy) 12

The car is pulled over Hanson getting out Aiello following
There’s lightning and thunder in the skies echoing through
the trees

Hanson nods to Aiello to back up and he does Hanson raises
and fires a flare gun the camera follows the flare up into
the stormy night sky then comes back down to Hanson

Hanson waits and then lights a cigarette and smokes
fidgeting

AIELLO (CONTD)
Did he say he’d be here

Hanson just looks at him

AIELLO (CONT’D)
I mean are you sure we can trust
him

Hanson chuckles to himself and smokes when-

SONIC BOOM trees shake and Aiello startled falls to the
ground The car alarm of the parked government sedan is
blaring in the night and then we hear it clicked off

Hanson who didn’t move a muscle reaches down and pulls
Aiello up revealing

MATT Garretty 20 This isn’t quite the Matt we last saw in
Tibet but it’s not exactly someone new either He has an
anxiousness to him a vulnerability that’s clumsily hidden
behind a veneer of confidence that it seems almost arbitrary
that the world’s only “superhuman” would have

He wears travel clothes He’s wet from the rain His hair
is long He almost lookshomeless

He seems to recognize Hanson

MATT
You’re Hanson right

HANSON
That’s right

He notices Aiello and reacts immediately

MATT
What the hell is that turn that
off-

HANSON

That’s Agent Michael Aiello-

Blue (mmddyyyy) 13

MATT
Tell him to stop filming you put
it away-

HANSON

I’m sorry Matthew but-

MATT
Don’t “Matthew” me turn that off-

HANSON
Our program mandates we have
digital record of every official
interaction with you This is for
your safety as well as ours okay

Matt groans in a display of authentic teen frustration

MATT
Look if you think I won’t just
leave you’re wrong okay-

HANSON
We need to talk Can you come with
us please

MATT
Is it my parents

HANSON
If you’ll just come with us-

MATT
Well I told you not to contact me
unless it was an emergency or if
something was up with my parents

so-
HANSON

This is an emergency
MATT

Yeah well what kind of emergency
HANSON

It’ll be better if you see it for

yourself

CLOSE ON

A laptop On the screen we see at first only darkness but
then a lenscap is removed revealing Andrew Detmer filming
himself in the door mirror of his room in Seattle
Blue (mmddyyyy) 14

My god It’s CHRONICLE
We pull out a little revealing
Matt hunched over in a chair watching the lap-top

MATT
What is this

HANSON
Just watch

INT EMPTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The room itself is small and featureless clean white
lighting There are several nameless government agents
standing around watching Matt clearly nervous as
Matt sits watching the laptop which has been set up on a
desk Behind him stands Hanson he looks on at Matt with
what even at only a glance we can instantly recognize as
genuine concern

CUT

Matt is watching himself sing “Price Tag” on screen

CUT

The baseball test is happening Matt seems almost hypnotized

CUT

Steve’s in the storm Lightning crashing all around him
Matt is chewing his own hand he looks almost childlike

The lightning flashes and Matt reaches out slamming closed
the laptop

CUT
It’s moments later Matt is pacing and crying at the other
side of the room talking to Hanson who seems to be
compelling him to watch the rest of it
Matt takes a beat and then nods

CUT

Matt is sitting and watching again his face one of barely
muted agony

Blue (mmddyyyy) 15

On the screen Andrew declares himself an Apex Predator
Aiello gets a little too close a little too personal and
Matt notices

MATT
(direct to camera)
Get that out of my face Now

Now Get it out of my face and
turn it off-

CUT

Matt is up and clearly very upset trying to keep it
together and be “an adult” as he goes back and forth with
Hanson

HANSON
It went up at 2 AM pacific time on
an untraceable URL Current
estimates put it at seven hundred
million downloads getting higher
every minute-

MATT
How the hell is this possible I
thought you had all the footage
that you confiscated all the
cameras—

HANSON
And we did They must’ve hacked
our servers All of the Haven
Hills Project footage is circulated
on the same hard drives we didn’t-

MATT
I’m sorry “hacked your servers”
What is this 1994- I thought this
stuff was supposed to be protected-
HANSON
Whoever did it is good Matt very
very good at what they do we-
Matt notices the camera filming him

MATT
I told you to turn that off

The camera suddenly crunches the lens cracking-
CRASH TO BLACK

FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA

EXT DESERT - MORNING - IN JACK’S TRUCK

At first just a view of the desert of the American
southwest blowing by at fifty miles an hour

We can hear “Walking On Broken Glass” by Annie Lennox
chugging away on a car radio over the wind

The camera pulls back revealing we’re filming from a
passenger seat Jack driving He notices the camera

JACK
Annie Lennox Killin’ it

He smiles at the camera and does a gun-click wink
We can hear Miranda laugh
CUT

They’re parked outside a desert gas station Miranda is
filming Jack get back into the car

JACK (CONTD)
I brought you a rootbeer- oh my god
what was that what did you just
do

MIRANDA (0S)
-It was my rootbeer dance-

JACK
Gimme that-—

Jack struggles away the camera
CUT

Miranda in desert gear is uncontrollably giggling in the
passenger side unable to perform her rootbeer dance for the
camera

CUT

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Come on Straight face

Miranda gets her shit together

MIRANDA
Okay Okay
(in a high voice doing a
little dance)
ROooO0o00O00tbURRHHHH-

Miranda loses her shit completely

CUT

Were in a tight close up on Miranda who’s out of breath
sobbing with laughter

JACK
Oh my god are you- you’re crying

Miranda nods choked unable to muster a response

JACK (CONTD)
This woman she loves rootbeer

EXT THE FLATS - DAY - LATER

The truck is parked and Miranda is following Jack around to
the back of it it’s big

JACK
Did you bring enough clozapine for
the whole trip-

MIRANDA (0S)
Yes of course Don’t talk about
that

JACK
Who are you so afraid is gonna see
this anywa- whoa jesus

Jacks looking out at the magnificent expanse of flat desert
ahead of him There’s junk here and there wrecked cars
refrigerators a bus or two even an old rickety plane

A desert dumping ground

JACK (CONTD)
Aw Mimi this is perfect How’d
you find this again

MIRANDA (0S)
They used to take me out here when
I was little

JACK
To do what exactly

Jack just looks at the camera

JACK (CONTD)
You don’t wanna talk about it
Okay Never do
He opens up the back of the truck

JACK (CONTD)
Let’s get this party started

HARD CUT TO

The camera has been placed on a tripod It now shows a
single car old and rusty

JACK (0S) (CONT’D)
We clear

MIRANDA (0S)
Clear

There’s that sound again that distinctive VRRRMMMMMM-

Three streams of blue tracer rounds beamlike explode in
from offscreen

The car is reduced to fragmented dust in SECONDS

JACK
WHOA HOLD FIRE HOLD FIRE

The dust settles There’s nearly nothing left

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
MirandaHOLY SHIT

Miranda cackles happily at Jack’s proclamation The
fragmented wreckage of the car is burning

JACK (CONTD)
IT’S ON FIRE
(beat)
---shit

HARD CUT TO

The camera is in a new location still on a tripod It now
shows an ancient worn down school bus

MIRANDA (0S)
Do you have your headphones on

JACK (0S)
What

MIRANDA (0S)
Haha okay Clear

There’s an awful tinny ear scratching whine and we can

actually see the thumping wave of sound flow in from
somewhere off-screen

It suddenly DROPS DOWN INTO DEEP BASS then SCREECHES BACK
UP every window on the bus shatters the whole thing shaking
violently

After a moment the incredible sonic weapon whatever it was
ceases function

Miranda creeps in from off-screen wearing big headphones
She goes over to the bus and pokes at it-

The entire side of the bus drops off and Miranda shrieks
We can hear Jack laughing

MIRANDA (CONTD)
(beaming)
It works
HARD CUT TO
There’s some kind of thing set up in the sand it looks like
an old hemi-engine with a small microwave satellite dish
attached to it and a long copper rod sticking up out of the
back
This is the Lightning Bug

JACK (0S8)
Lightning Bug test goingslowly

Some sparks shoot out of it

MIRANDA (0S)
Goddamnit

CUT
Miranda is futzing with it sautering something and
tightening bolts Jack walks out into frame kneels down and
gives her a little backrub

CUT

Theyre off camera again

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
Okay here we go Clear

Nothing

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
Aw stupid stupid

Jack comes out into frame headed towards the Lightning Bug

JACK
I’1l go check if the-

The Lightning Bug activates the little radar dish turns and
points towards Jack

JACK (CONTD)
Whoa whoa-

-and BLASTS JACK WITH A SMALL BOLT OF LIGHTNING that sends
him flying backwards

MIRANDA
JACK

CUT

The camera’s off the tripod Miranda behind it filming Jack
who’s sitting on the ground his hair on end looking
frazzled

JACK
-done okay Yeah we’re done for
the day I’m done for theweek

MIRANDA (0S)
Are you okay

JACK
Wellit works

After a moment Jack starts laughing Miranda starts
laughing too

CUT

Jacks up and by the Lightning Bug smiling at it drinking a
beer thinking he’s already talking

JACK (CONTD)
-is perfect I figure we pin him
down with the sonics and then
bampowzap we Steve him Ha

The camera falters

JACK (CONTD)
What What’s-

CUT

Jack now holds the camera following a crying Miranda around
the side of the truck

MIRANDA
Why are you filming STOP IT

JACK (0S)
I want you to remember this moment

MIRANDA
What WHY

Miranda whirls around actually confronting Jack’s camera
When she’s like this there’s something slightly dangerous
about her

But only slightly For now

MIRANDA (CONTD)
That was an awful thing you
shouldn’t have said that Steve
was a- he was a nice person he was
trying to help-

JACK (0S)
I know I know you’re right
youre right

Miranda seems about to say more but then falters looking
out into the desert frustrated

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
What’s this really about

MIRANDA
I just- I worry that maybe I
haven’t- been thinking clearly or
I- Jack I don’t know I just feel
like- I don’t want to hurt people

She squeaks these last words out almost afraid to say them
Jack goes to her but he stays behind the camera for a
reason

Just watching the shift in expression on her face tells the
whole story
Blue (mmddyyyy) 22

JACK (0S)
Hurt people- Miranda- People have
already BEEN hurt We can’t let
our emotions get caught up in this
this is about justice this is
about not letting power blind us to
our responsiblities to our fellow
man We have to kill him you know
that

Miranda nods soberly

JACK (CONTD)
And if people get hurt then people
get hurt thats okay we can
accept that Even if we get hurt
wed be martyred for a good cause
Were the good guys not him
Were the heroes

MIRANDA
(quietly)

JACK (0S)
Do you trust me

MIRANDA
(calmer )
Yes

JACK (0S)
I’m sorry That was a terrible
insensitive thing of me to say

MIRANDA
Thank you
(beat)
You want to try the magnets

EXT THE FLATS - LATE AFTERNOON
The reveal is so casual that it’s almost startling

The Martyr Suit Prototype stands roughly eight feet tall
it’s not of a piece with many different colors and shapes of
the hundreds of different components it’s been cobbled
together from

It looks distinctly rickety and do-it-yourself and it’s
clearly just a skeletal prototype but they’re no arguing
that we are looking at a nearly ten foot tall suit of ROBOT
ARMOR

e ee FH HH

JACK
This isinsane Mimi
Two of the miniguns are mounted on stalks beneath the arms
the Lightning Bug is hooked to the back and what look like
turbo-bass’s are hooked into the clawed “hands”
It’s some science fiction fever dream made real An
impossibly beautiful and delicate machine crafted by the one
mind on earth capable of building it
Jack fully visible inside of it looks gleeful as he talks
down to Miranda who’s behind the camera bouncing around in
the suit like a boxer it moves easily and gracefully
WE CUT BETWEEN

Miranda’s camera and
THE MARTYR PROTOYPE’S CAMERA

Which is mounted on the chest

JACK (CONTD)
How’s this Like this

Jack starts doing the robot and Miranda laughs
CUT
Jack has put on a motorcycle helmet He looks awesome
MIRANDA (0S)
Okay Electromagnetic flight full-
suit Martyr prototype test one

Jack nods

JACK
Okay I do it I justI just do
it
MIRANDA (0S)
Yes
JACK
Okay

Jack takes a couple deep breaths and then activates
something inside the suit There’s a loud “Mmnmnmnmnmnmn”
noise and he RAPIDLY FLOATS UP INTO THE AIR-

Whoa way too rapidly Miranda is forced to chase after him
like an untethered balloon
Blue (mmddyyyy) 24

MIRANDA
Jack JACK USE THE STABILIZERS
JACK
The suit is now just a speck in the air On the Martyr suit
cams we can see Miranda waaaaay down below frantically
waving her arms

JACK (0S8)
Well Flyingsucks

CUT

It’s a few minutes later Miranda’s filming up from the
ground searching the dusky sky

MIRANDA (0S)
JACK Oh jesus- JACK JACK

A little point of light appears on the horizon two reds and
a green

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
Jack

The Martyr suit comes SCREAMING IN AT NINETY MILES AN HOUR
ZIPPING PAST MIRANDA BEFORE TWIRLING BEAUTIFULLY UP INTO A
LOoP

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
JACK YES YES

It comes back and does another close pass before SMASHING
INTO THE SAND

MIRANDA (0S) (CONTD)
OH SHIT-

CUT

Jack is holding the camera dirty with sand filming himself
as Miranda finishes stitching up a cut on his forehead

JACK
(indicates cut)
Now thisthis is punk rock
Miranda coos disdainfully

CUT

The sun hangs low in the sky
Blue (mmddyyyy) 25

The prototype Martyr suit has been set up next to a campfire
Jack sits nearby clearly deep in thought looking very sad

MIRANDA
What are you thinking about
(beat)
Are you thinking about Terry
JACK
Yeah
MIRANDA

What are you thinking about him

JACK

The last time we talked You
know he called me

(emotional )
He called me that night He said
“Jack turn on TV you’ve got to
see this They’re flying” And he
sounded so excited I
rememberAnd I could hear the
helicopter you know

(beat)
My whole life he was the good
brother you know

MIRANDA
You’re good-

JACK

No I’m- he had goals he was
married he had a life I’m
justsome guy I’m a piece of
shit

(beat)
He wasn’t a cop He was just a
helicopter pilot he didn’t do
anything to Andrew Detmer And he-
he just-

(Jack’s overcome crying)
He just killed him like it was
nothing Like it was nothing like
he was a bug-

Jacks crying overcome and Miranda moves to comfort him
but he backs her off

JACK (CONTD)
Twenty six people died and people
don’t care

government says forget forget it

held accountable for this
Somebody has to

Jack fully breaks down
CUT
Jack’s slightly recovered

JACK (CONTD)
That’s whyYou know I believe in

coincidence that we found each
other For this Because we’re

It’s later There’s music playing in the background the
mood is a little lighter The camera is picked up form where
it’s been set down and we see Miranda sitting and working
on leg of the MARTYR prototype

She notices Jack filming and smiles self consciously

JACK (CONTD)

INT JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
A couple days have passed

Jack is already talking to Miranda who’s behind the camera
he’s animated angry and the change in tone is extremely
jarring The TV is on it’s cracked and distorted from
Jack’s last tantrum

JACK
-and when are we gonna have another
chance like this

He indicates the TV

BROADCASTER
-holding his first ever “press
conference” to address the
grassroots release of “Chronicle”
which now boasts nearly one billion
downloads worldwide-

JACK
That’s four hundred miles from
here we’ll never get this
opportunity again-

MIRANDA (0S)
The suit isn’t ready it isn’t-

Jack flustered walks away and she follows him as he paces
through the house angrily fidgeting with EVERYTHING

JACK
We can use the prototype

MIRANDA (0S)
No Jack it isn’t strong enough
that would be suicide-
Blue (mmddyyyy)

JACK
And what’s wrong with that

MIRANDA (0S)
I won’t let you you-

JACK

whole way You got the footage

weapon But now it’s time for me
to do my part I have to-

MIRANDA (0S)

JACK
The prototype is enough You’re
just afraid

MIRANDA (0S)
I don’t want you to get hurt I
don’t want anyone to-

JACK

ENTERING ANOTHER
HOTEL ROOM

As they go in to another hotel room we get a good look at
Stephanie in a mirror She’s pretty but not a knockout
definitely smart fit and looking like the sharpest knife in
the room

Richard DETMER early 40s comes in he’s cleaner calmer
than the man we remember from Chronicle and his face lights
up upon seeing Matt

They hug

DETMER MATT
Hey Matty Hey Uncle Richard

DETMER

the- government people

The camera spins to reveal

MRS Sarah GARRETTY late 40s the loud mom type entering
the room followed closely by

MR Kyle GARRETTY late 40s the quiet dad type Both of
them are nervous as Matt goes to them embracing them

MR GARRETTY

MATT

Matt gives him a big hug and then turns to the camera
immediately childlike expectation in his voice

MATT (CONT’D)

parents He’s clearly very nervous now

MRS GARRETTY

MATT
Mom I know I know-

MR GARRETTY

FROM NEWS CAMERAS CAMERAS IN THE CROWD

EXT AT and T PARK - MOMENTS LATER

The baseball stadium is absolutely packed with people who
are brimming with excitement A stage with a podium and a
microphone has been set up on the field

There’s an electricity in the air here Energy is palpable
you can feel the hairs on your arms stand up

We can overhear chatter and talking from the crowd and then
all at once-

It’s SHOCKING People are standing and cheering screaming
their hearts out as Matt drops down from the sky landing
near the podium

People are LOSING THEIR MINDS After almost twenty seconds
of cheering Matt approaches the mic and they go silent

MATT
Hi

The ovation is deafening Matt startles at the sound of it
and then raises a hand in a self-conscious wave

MATT (CONTD)

When I was eighteen I- wow it got
quiet

(beat)
OkayWhen I was eighteen I went
to a party It actually was kind
of a crappy party which was what
makes it all sofunny I guess
I took my cousin Andrew because he
was a lonely guy and I ended up
hanging out with Steve Montgomery
because he wasawesome

(laughs self-conscious)
Look you already know all this
which is weird it’s so weird I
feel like- I don’t know just
totally exposed and-

The mic suddenly crackles loudly startling the audience and
Matt All of the electronics in the stadium flicker oddly
Blue (mmddyyyy) 35

the big screen warps and distorts from electromagnetic
interference

Matt looks around confused He touches his nose It’s
bleeding Uh-oh

Matt looks up at something in the sky-
VRRMMMMMM

STREAMS OF MINIGUN FIRE DECIMATE THE STAGE AND THE FIELD
AROUND IT- MATT DISAPPEARS IN AN EXPLOSION OF WRECKAGE AND
DUST AS WE TURN TO SEE-

OF COURSE-

THE MARTYR SUIT PROTOTYPE SWOOPS LOW OVER THE BLEACHERS
MINIGUNS BLAZING-

THE ENTIRE PLACE DEVOLVES INTO ABSOLUTE CHAOS

Our viewpoints are shifted and disoriented no one’s trying
to film this it’s a superpowered set-piece as we’ve never
witnessed it before as viewed by people in the middle
trying to get as far away from the action as possible

The Martyr Prototype lands loudly in the bleachers behind
home-plate and FIRES THE SONIC WEAPON INTO THE CROWD
clearing a path to the wreckage of the stage-

Which explodes upwards Matt telekinetically tossing it away
dirty and covered in cuts-

Matt swings an arm at the suit and it’s BLOWN BACKWARDS-
But twists midair and rockets into the sky-

-and Matt takes off after it TACKLING IT INTO THE NOSEBLEED
SEATS-

Where they crash violently into the structure ripping up
dozens of seats before Jack FLINGS Matt off him AGAIN
OPENING FIRE WITH THE MACHINE GUNS shooting THROUGH the
panicking crowd-

Matt thinking fast telekinetically SHOVES ALL THE PEOPLE
AROUND HIM DOWN and then throws up a telekinetic wall
blocking the stream of bullets-

-the sonic weapon turns on and BLOWS HIM BACKWARDS off the
edge of the stadium along with several bystanders-

-but he simply flies back up catching all the bystanders and
throwing them to safety (WHOA) before psi-grabbing a dozen
of the broken chairs and flinging them at Jack-

Jack opens fire with the miniguns again but the chairs knock
him off balance and the glowing blue stream of bullets goes
off wild into the sky

FROM HELICOPTER NEWSCAM

We get an aerial view of the pandemonium in the stadium when
THE ERRATIC STREAM OF BULLETS comes within INCHES of slicing
the chopper in half

HELICOPTER PILOT
Shit clear the air clear the air
get us the hell out of here

FROM NEWS CAMERAS CAMERAS IN THE CROWD

Matt blasts Jack backwards with a huge wave of force but
again Jack pirouettes into flight corkscrewing back around
guns BLAZING-

-jesus that was beautiful and incredible-
Matt launches off and we-

-follow them from various tight intimate vantage points as
the two of them crash through the stadium’s different levels
Jack firing off the miniguns and sonic weapons with reckless
abandon until-

Matt spun out by the sonic weapon crashes into the pitchers
mound-—

Jack lands right next to him the Lightning Bug engine
REVVING ON HIS BACK ELECTRICITY CRACKLING UP THE LIGHTING
ROD-

Matt stands-
-grabs the Martyr Prototype by the chest-

-and FLINGS IT TWO HUNDRED FEET UP INTO THE HUGE LIGHT RIG
OVER THE FIELD

The Lightning Bug EXPLODES malfunctioning wildly cascading
an anarchy of electricity IN ALL DIRECTIONS The lights all
around Jack pop and BURST in a chaos of light and noise

Matt down on the field looks up at all the anarchy in the
stadium and touches his bleeding presumably ringing ears
He’s covered in cuts and bruises already
Blue (mmddyyyy) 37

He staggers clearly trying to clear his head

National Guard troops have started to appear and one of them
gets in one of our crowd camera’s face the situation is
being brought under controlish

FROM THE MARTYR PROTOYPE’S CAMERA

We can hear Jack struggling but it’s no good clearly parts
of it were damaged from the fight and what was left after
that has been fried by the explosion of the Lightning Bug

He’s imbedded in the lighting rigBut down below him on
the top of the huge digital Scoreboard display we can see
Miranda climbing up from an access ladder

She holds the camera at her side not filming she looks wild-
eyed and panicked furious

JACK (0S)
(yelling to her)
I’m sorry baby You know it had to
be this way

She screams back at him but we can barely hear her She’s
crying we can see that now the suit’s camera zooms in to
see her

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Get that camera out This is our
moment this is what we worked for

Miranda shakes her head violently yelling at him

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Come on Mimi Don’t make me do
this alone

Miranda stares at him for a moment then slowly raises the
camera

FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA

We can hear her breathing hard crying behind the camera as
she pans the chaos in the stadium

MIRANDA (0S)
(muttering)
I told you no I told you no You
promised you promised I told you
no

Something flits past and she follows it It’s Matt he
flies up to where Jack’s stuck getting very close
Blue (mmddyyyy) 38

MIRANDA (CONT’D)
No Stop No

We INTERCUT between THE MARTYR PROTOYPE CAM and MIRANDA’S

Matt getting his first real look at the Martyr Prototype is
clearly in an even mix of horror and fascination He gets
close but a crackle of electricity makes him back off a tiny
bit

When he finally speaks to Jack it’s in an abstract way
almost as though Jack didn’t just try to murder him injuring
and possibly killing dozens of innocent people

Matt is reacting exactly how you’d react if you were seeing
the CRAZY SHIT he’s seeing

MATT
Whhhhhhwhat the hell is this
Did you build this jesus christ
man

The suit struggles but Matt has it pinned it’s tangled in
the wiring of the lights

MATT (CONTD)
Quit trying to fight you are going
nowhere

MIRANDA (0S)
Please stop pleasestoppleasestop

Jack breathing hard clearly scared unleashes his polemic

JACK (0S8)

HOW ARE YOU GONNA SAVE THE WORLD
MATT You killed your cousin and
then you RAN AWAY YOU COULDNT
EVEN SAVE ANDREW TELL ME HOW

YOURE GONNA SAVE THE WORLD-

MATT
Whoa hey- just- shut up I don’t
understand- who are you what do
you want from me

JACK (0S)
You were there I’m not going to
let you walk away from what
happened There’s nothing to stop
you from becoming what you could
become There has to be justice
for what you did I will restore
balance to the human race

e FF HF
Blue (mmddyyyy) 39

MIRANDA
JACK NO PLEASE JACK NO
NOOOOOQOOOQOO0000000000

This last shriek is loud enough that Matt actually hears it
confused he turns Miranda looking down to where she stands
far beneath him

For a moment they make eye contact but only Miranda’s
camera catches this

MATT
Who-

Jack takes the opportunity to flip open a little panel and
hit a button on the Martyr suit-

-Matt turns and notices a split second before-

kaBOOM

The explosion is MASSIVE the wire-frame tower of the light
rig coming apart like an erector set

Matt is blasted out of the air like a missile crashing down
to the diamond below

Miranda and her camera are smashed by the shock wave the
camera is dropped but Miranda is knocked all the way off the
top of screens and we watch from her dropped camera as she
has to scramble to hold on to the ledge

-gonna fall-

No Miranda forces herself back up onto the top immediately
collapsing to her knees hyperventilating

MIRANDA
NnNononono JACK JACK
NO JACK JACK NO NO

The words take on a dangerous broken screech She’s making
sounds but they’re not words so much not anymore

It should be tragic but insteadIt’s somehow chilling
Miranda Hodgkins might not have fallen to her death
But she has gone over the edge

INT HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - HANSON’S OFFICE

The camera is hurriedly being turned on first filming the
floor then up to Hanson We’re in his office tasteful
functional nothing fancy

News reports from San Francisco play on a big screen on the
wall Hanson is typing something on his laptop

HANSON
You got that on Good

From somewhere outside we can hear a SONIC BOOM and the
building rattles Hanson sighs and sits back in his chair
clearly thinking preparing himself

HANSON (CONTD)
(to camera)
Stay calm

There’s a crashing shattering sound from somewhere in the
building Then after a moment another one Then a third
much closer

Then VERY SUDDENLY-

The oak door blasts off its hinges crashing to the ground
and Matt storms through he paces like a caged animal in
front of Hanson’s desk still covered in bruises cuts dust
and dirt

He’s followed cautiously by another agent with another
camera

Matt’s eyes are slightly wild but he’s keeping it together

MATT
Okay FIRST OF ALL first of all
what the hell was that thing I do
not for a second believe that guy
built that alone You’re going to
find who built it okay

(MORE)
Blue (mmddyyyy) 42

HER okay And my family I want
my family out of there as far as
possible and somewhere safe do
you hear me HEY ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME DO YOU HEAR ME DO IT
Now

Matt stands there breathing hard

Hanson takes off his glasses and shuts his laptop standing
He stares at Matt blankly there’s no fear in his eyes No
anything except

Faced with the most powerful human being on Earth Scott
Hanson looks

Annoyed

HANSON
Who the hell do you think you are

MATT
What

Hanson comes around his desk speaking in a measured tone

HANSON
You’re gonna order me around In
what alternate reality are you
living that you think you can walk
in here and shout at me I am not
your employee any more than you are
mine weve offered you an official
position you said no-

MATT HANSON
Oh come on this again -We’ve offered you
really really protection so when something

like this inevitably happened-

MATT
What so this is my fault are you
stupid are you an idiot did you

HANSON
HEY Being a nice guy who can fly

-Did you not see what JUST FREAKING
HAPPENED-

HANSON

-knock my goddamn nice oak door off
the- sit down

MATT
-Someone tried to kill me man
They hurt people they-

HANSON
-and being scared does not give you
the right to be an asshole SIT
DOWN

Matt falters for the first time we really feel the weight of
Hanson’s presence Matt’s still just a kid looking for a
home and Hanson’s complete confidence is enough to stop the
rotation of the earth

They face off like that for a moment before Matt showing his
age loud and clear begrudgingly pulls out a chair and flops
down into it

MATT
(to camera)
Turn that off

HANSON
Leave it on

CUT

The room is full of agents now taking notes on paper and
digital devices Cuts on Matt’s forehead neck and arm are
being bandaged by medics while a sketch artist finishes
taking a description

Hanson in the meantime is going a mile a minute to various
agents talking on the phone and skyping

HANSON (CONTD)
Yeah I want every camera we can
get this is Seattle Protocol
people pull everything

The sketch artist finishes his drawing and holds it up to
Matt it’s a mostly accurate rendering of Miranda

HANSON (CONTD)
This her

MATT
Yeah that’syeah

HANSON
Okay

Hanson turns and rattles out orders with absolute confidence
and lightning fast speed as everyone takes notes It’s The
Fugitive

HANSON (CONT’D)

The agents depart hurriedly as Hanson leans into his
intercom

HANSON (CONTD)
Pentagon you got all that

PENTAGON OFFICER
(on phone)

HANSON
Thank you

Hanson clicks off the phone He and Matt are left alone (to
the exclusion of the camera and the medics)

HANSON (CONTD)
How bad are his injuries

MATT

Blue (mmddyyyy) 45

HANSON
Uh-huh How bad are his injuries

MEDIC
Mostly superficial but we’ve got
to keep a watch on this cut on his

neck

HANSON
Okay you mind giving us some
space

The medic nods and heads out Hanson sighs looking at Matt
who’s clearly self conscious about his earlier outburst

HANSON (CONTD)
See No yelling needed We got
all hands on deck now We told you
if you’d cooperate with our
operation wed protect you and
were doing our best to do that
Good enough

It’s kind of a miracle really We

to process it pushing away the darker thoughts

He snaps out of it

He’s peeling back the bandage on his forehead

MATT

Agh god that stings

You really shouldn’t-

MATT
No it’s okay I’m gonna show you
a trick

He looks at the cut on his neck and then tears the bandage
off in one move

MATT (CONTD)
OW MOTHERFU-

CUT
Were getting a close up of the cut on Matt’s neck It’s a
bit gruesome Matt for his part seems to have mentally

taken up a place familiar to us all giggly excitement

familiar perhaps from a toy store or a backyard long
ago
Blue (mmddyyyy) 48

MATT (CONTD)
Alright you- got it yeah

STEPHANIE (0S)
Yeah What’re you-

MATT
Okay this is one of my new ones
okay

Matt holds up his hand over the cut and after a moment the
stitches pop out

MATT (CONTD)
Okay wow this hurts

And thenthe cut now open pulls together the skin
weaving together and rapidly scabbing over and then the scab
falling away to reveal a perfectly healed scar

STEPHANIE (0S)
Holy shit

MATT
Riiiiight Pretty good

CUT

STEPHANIE (0S)
How long have you been able to do
that

MATT
Couple of months I figured out how
to do it after I got that flu was
that before you were here

STEPHANIE (0S)
I think so

MATT
I got that flu and I figured if I
could visualize me grabbing and
crushing every little virus I
could be healthy again And it
worked So then I was like if I
could visualize me stimulating the
cells to repair and knit
togetherand I guess that works
too

Matt smiles clearly very proud of himself but also just
glad to have someone to talk to

The camera goes back to Matt but he’s already getting up

STEPHANIE
Matt what’re you- wait wait-

Stephanie is chasing Matt up a hallway

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Matt wait for a second just talk
to me-

They reach the elevators Matt going in to an open one and
Stephanie following him

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Listen I know you want to go out
but Hanson says-

Matt smirks and ducks out of the elevator making a pinching
motion with his fingers that causes the elevator doors to
SLAM SHUT

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
-Shit

FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA

EXT HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

The camera rushes to catch up with Matt who’s walking
purposefully in the field area around the large government
facility building wooded on all sides

AIELLO (0S)
Mr Garretty Wait Mr Garretty

MATT
Not now Mike I-

HANSON
Hey What the hell

Hanson rapidly approaches

MATT
Oh here we go

HANSON
The hell is the idea trapping
Stephanie in the elevator like
that

Blue (mmddyyyy) 52

MATT
There’s a big pile-up on the ten
gasoline fires I thought-

HANSON
No You’re grounded you’re on
break til we figure this out

MATT
I’m sorry I’m grounded

HANSON
It’s for your own safety

MATT
I don’t take breaks okay that
isn’t how this works I made a
promise that I would help people
if I see an opportunity to do that
and I don’t-

HANSON
The entire world is talking about
YOU right now Matt nothing else
Those psychos who tried to kill you
are most likely waiting for you to
show your face so they can-

MATT
So they can what That thing blew
up-

HANSON

Who says they don’t have another
one who says they don’t have TEN
more

MATT
So I’m supposed to what hang
around here picking my nose til
another robot drops out of the sky
and starts blowing crap up Screw
that man

Matt and Hanson come out to an excavation site the ground
has been dug away exposing the massive front mantel of the
crystalline entity from Chronicle

It’s MUCH bigger than what we saw before and free of the
chamber around it it’s debatably clear that what we’re
looking at is some kind of face Not like any face on any
animal we’ve ever seen before but still

A face

Blue (mmddyyyy)

Men are down there doing tests on it running scans and
such

Neither Matt nor Hanson acknowledge its presence

HANSON
That’s what terrorism is Matt
it’s waiting It’s accepting that
something bigger than you is-

MATT
But it’s not bigger than me it’s
ABOUT me

HANSON

Listen YOU’RE not just YOU
anymore You’re an idea you’re a-
a superher-

MATT
Yeah well what if I don’t want to
be an idea what then Where does
what I want come in to it

Hanson sighs

HANSON
I’m not FBI I’m not CIA I’m not
anything anymore I’m Haven Hills

to you and half tothat

MATT
—-Mogo-

HANSON
Whatever you wanna call him sure
Point is he doesn’t have anyone
shooting at him yeah

Matt’s listening

MATT
(beat)
We have transport arranged for you
to your parents’ safehouse we
figure that where you stay until we
have a next step Okay

After a beat Matt shrugs

MATT (CONT’D)
Okay

Blue (mmddyyyy) 54

Hanson eyes him for a moment clearly questioning his
sincerity

INT HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Matt is exiting a room holding a duffle-bag walking with a
purpose Aiello follows him

EXT HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Matt walks ahead of Aiello

AIELLO (0S)

MATT

AIELLO (0S)
But the bus is the other way-

MATT

of helping people nope sorry
(beat)
I don’t respond well to bullying

AIELLO (0S)
I’m under orders not to leave your
side

MATT
Yeah
(beat)
Well then hold your breath

MATT LAUNCHES INTO THE AIR AND WE’RE DRAGGED RIGHT BEHIND
HIM PAST THE SOUND BARRIER THE WORLD BLURRING BY MATT OUT
AHEAD THE LANDSCAPE ZIPPING PAST BENEATH AND THEN-

EXT FREEWAY -— CONTINUOUS

Matt lands and we suddenly decelerate rapidly and land ina
rough roll

Aiello struggles to his feet the camera whipping around
wildly we’re right in the middle of the pile up Cars are
crashed and flipped all over the place

ee

Blue (mmddyyyy) 55

Oil fires burn as firemen struggle to put them out the jaws
of life are being applied to a crumpled car

Matt starts subtly casually waving his hands

The crumpled car UNCRUNCHES releasing the man trapped in
side into the arms of the fire fighters The doors of all
the flipped or damaged cars rip off and fall to the ground

And then lastly with a careless swoop of his arm the fires
go out

Matt turns seeing a newsvan on the scene and rapidly walks
towards it

AIELLO (0S)
Mister Garretty Mister Garretty
please

FROM NEWS CAMERA

The REPORTER is stunned and star-struck as Matt brushes right
by him going right up to the camera grabbing it by the lens
and pulling it right up to his face

MATT
I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU

CRASH TO BLACK

FROM THE WHIRLYBIRD CAMERA

INT JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

For a moment things are out of focus but then it pulls
together We’re looking through a slightly fish-eyed lens
Jacks basement sitting on a workshop table

Most of the lights are off but the room is lit in a spooky
blue glow by lap-tops and smartphones EVERYWHERE all
interlinked with firewire cables all the screens are on
with code rapidly scrolling across them running some kind of
program

Miranda is front and center tinkering with something behind
the camera She looks flatly put insane Her eyes are
wide but seem unfocused she’s tousled and unwashed and has
math equations written ALL OVER her arms

There’s a buzz and she smiles standing up and away from the
cameraWhich with a gentle “whirrrr” sound lifts into the
air

Blue (mmddyyyy) 56

MIRANDA
See Jack No hands

CUT

Whatever the camera is riding on follows Miranda floating
roughly six feet in the air as she picks her way through the
basement now more cluttered than ever to the stairs

The manic hyper-decisive way she speaks is unmistakable A
schizophrenic slowly coming unglued from our reality

We get the impression from her delivery that even if there
was no camerashe’d be saying all this to herself

MIRANDA (CONTD)
It’s done now I finished it this
morning You were right We do
need to keep filming So they can
know who we were That we weren’t
the bad guys That it was him It
was him

CUT

Miranda is walking up the stairs and in the light we can see
that she’s written all over the walls

MIRANDA (CONTD)
They showed you on TV you would’ve
been so impressed it’s all anybody
is talking about now I’ve been
very busy I have to be careful
because they’re watching me now

CUT

Miranda’s up in the house which is a mess things are
broken equations written on the walls in sharpie

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I never told you because I knew
youd think I was crazy but there
are people watching me all the
time Eyes in the sky in every
camera that’s why I don’t go out

We get our first look at our new camera when it passes a
mirror it’s a simple store-bought miniature helicopter the
sort you can download aps to control with your iPhone
modified by Miranda’s brilliant mind to be her own personal
documentarian

MIRANDA (CONTD)

There are bugs here Jack bugs
everywhere Now that you’re not
here I see that there are little
red spiders all over everything I
think you kept them away your
scent your pheromones or a
chemical in your blood I would
take your blood and rub it all over
me if it would keep them off haha
it sounds crazy but I really would

Miranda looks around the dirty destroyed living room with
genuine concern and fear

MIRANDA (CONTD)
This will all have to burn soon

CUT

Miranda is stalking through the house carrying a bunch of
circuit boards and machinery when there’s A SUDDEN POUNDING
AT THE DOOR

Miranda drops everything and it crashes to the floor

LANDLORD (0S)
Mr Fisk Mister Jack It’s Lupe

Miranda ducks off screen quickly the camera trying to track
her quick movement but then giving up and hanging in the
middle of the room filming the door

LANDLORD (0S) (CONTD)
Your rent is two weeks overdue
You need to pay now please

Miranda reappears holding a kitchen knife staring at the
door trembling with potential energy

LANDLORD (0S) (CONT’D)
I know you’re in there Open the
door or I’m coming in Five
Four Three Two OKAY You
make me do this

The key jangles in the lock and Miranda raises the knife
higher The knob turns The door opens-

-but catches on the chain Daylight floods in and an arm
comes through reaching around trying to undo the chain

Miranda rapidly stalks towards the arm getting ready to stab
it the whirlybird following her (oh shit oh shit) but then
stops waiting-

The arm unsuccessful at undoing the chain retracts to from
whence it came the door slamming closed

LANDLORD (0S) (CONTD)
I’ll be back You got two days
I’m coming back with la policia

We can hear the landlord depart Miranda turns and stares
back at the camera and gives a weird flinching smile

CUT

Miranda is hurrying through the hallway taking off her
shirt As she enters the bedroom she slams the door the
Whirlybird bumps into it

CUT

Miranda suddenly bursts out of the bedroom and the
whirlybird banks hard to follow her movement she’s now
wearing a tight tank-top and yoga pants stripped down

A flight suit
CUT

Miranda heads to the basement talking back to the camera as

she goes There’s a sense of sober contemplative reason in
her voice that mixes strangely with the lunacy and squalor

around her

MIRANDA
When a caterpillar is born it’s
one hundred percent caterpillar
every cell in the body is of a
whole doing the same things
operating the same way But then
one day one of the cells changes
the illuminated cell

CUT

She’s further down the stairs heading into the darkness
From downstairs we can hear something powering up

MIRANDA (CONTD)
It can come from anywhere the eye
a leg the heart

(MORE)

MIRANDA (CONTD)
But the illuminated cell begins to
spread the word to all the other
cells that it’s time to change and
they do That one cell sends a
message to millions of others it
changes them and makes them
beautiful

CUT

Miranda’s down in the darkness now lit by the glow of all
the laptops On a screen behind her we can see Matt’s “I AM
NOT AFRAID OF YoU” playing on loop muted

MIRANDA (CONTD)
That was you Jack you changed my
life I was lost and I was alone
and I thought that was all I could
be But you found me And you
loved me And you gave me a
purpose

The computers let out a greek chorus of confirmation “beeps”
and “dings” Suddenly all of the screens show a geographical
location a marker from a satellite photograph

MIRANDA (CONTD)

And now I’m part of something
bigger than myself I’m going to
change the world I understand
now I understand what you said
about us being martyrs

Miranda presses a small button like a car-key and the full
Martyr suit now completed activates behind her in the
darkness a hulking formless shape

We can see the three lights two green and one red turn on
as well as two bright headlights that reduce Miranda to a
strange ghostly silhouette

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I am an illuminated cell

Matt sits contemplating the baseball He almost starts to
cry but then quickly stops himself self conscious in front
of the camera

Matt is standing by the edge trying to stay away from the
camera

MATT (CONTD)

You know what it is Like what it

would see on TV people would catch
pictures of me and it would be

BLUR-STATIC AND
THEN

FROM HIGHWAY PATROL DASH CAM

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A truck has been pulled over by the highway it’s dark and
the only movement is the occasional thunderous blur of a big
rig speeding past

A big tarp covers the bed of the truck something large
hulking beneath it creating an odd shape

There’s a sense of menace almost immediately as the HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN walks into frame headed to the front of the truck

CUT

Miranda () is being walked around to the back standing next
to the massive tarp

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Do you know how fast you were
going

Miranda doesn’t respond for a beat staring at him nods
then shakes her head

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Yes No
(beat)
You okay

Miranda starts to respond a huge truck rumbles past
startling her and us

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Okay can you respond to me
Anything

MIRANDA
I don’tI don’t know

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You don’t know

Another huge truck blows past and Miranda flinches The cop
eyeballs her for a moment then sighs

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Just stand right behind your truck
there I feel like something’s
going on and if you can’t confirm
or deny that then maybe you should
go with me for a minute yeah

Miranda stares at him in silence

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Okay I’m gonna call this in you
stay right here You’re not gonna
run are you

Miranda stares at him a beat then shakes her head looking
around into the night The cop laughs nervous

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Well okay

The cop walks back to his car going around out of sight

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
(on radio)
Yeah we’ve got a 23103 just north
of the 10 code-4 right now-

Miranda suddenly turns and runs around the side of the truck
climbing up and disappearing under the tarp

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (0S) (CONTD)
(on radio)
Shit shit- 11-99 subject is- shit-

The cop ditches the radio and comes around back into the
headlights gun drawn
Blue (mmddyyyy) 65

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Ma’m you come out of there right
now You come out of there RIGHT
Now

Silence The wind blows A faint hum starts from underneath
the tarp

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Miss you have five seconds to
comply Five Four

A huge truck blows past startling the cop

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Three Two One

Silence The cop edges forward and tugs at the tarp-

VRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMM AN EXPLOSION OF BLUE LIGHT AS THE

MRS GARRETTY

Stephanie holds up a hand

STEPHANIE
What Repeat did not copy-

AIELLO (0S)
What’s going on

MRS GARRETTY
Oh my god look

She’s gone to the window which looks out to the driveway

Which is starting to completely flood with smoke from
smoke grenades the whole area outside blotting with
impenetrable fog

MATT
Mom no okay no

Matt hurries and pulls his mother away from the window
closer to his dad The camera glimpses something enter the
room and turns

The Whirlybird has floated in through a window

STEPHANIE
SHIT MIKE CAMERA DOWN GUN OUT
Now

MRS GARRETTY
What’s going on Matt what’s going
on-

Aiello’s camera goes down and we jump to
THE WHIRLYBIRD CAMERA

Where we see the entire room Matt his parents the agents
all staring at it Aiello tossing down his digital camera and
drawing his pistol

Everyones boggled Stephanie steps forward plucking it out
of the air looking directly into it

Stephanie stares into the Whirlybird camera

STEPHANIE
What is this-

THE WALL BEHIND HER EXPLODES INWARD MR AND MRS GARRETTY
BEING FLUNG DOWN VIOLENTLY THE ROOM IS SUDDENLY FILLED WITH
CRAZY BLUE LIGHT AS EVERYTHING IS SHREDDED BY THE MINI GUNS
SWISS-CHEESING THE WHOLE BOTTOM FLOOR OF THE HOUSE THE SONIC
WEAPONS SHATTERING ALL THE GLASS AND DISTORTING EVERYTHING
INTO CHAOS

The whirlybird is yanked down and sees absolutely none of
this clearly

And thensilence

After a moment it hovers up again showing us the trashed
room Matt’s parents are down and in dazed agony Matt is
slowly getting up shaking away rubble

The Whirlybird focuses him on him approaching and we can
see Stephanie getting up from rubble behind him

Matt’s clearly in shock moving jerkily disoriented as he
heads towards the massive hole in the wall

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Matt stay inside STAY INSIDE

Matt takes another cautious step forward and makes a gentle
movement with his hands in a beautiful memorable reveal
the smoke telekinetically parts sweeping aside to reveal
Blue (mmddyyyy) 68

THE MARTYR SUIT

The fever dream of the prototype has graduated into a
nightmare

The monstrous suit completely hides the wearer inside and
the number of minigun “arms” has been upped to four they
stick out over the shoulders and from the hips

This gives the entire design a vaguely arachnid appearance
it’s unsettling Like the prototype it’s clearly been make-
shifted together from a thousand different sources but this
is cleaner meaner stronger and a thousand times more
deadly

MATT
-Holy shit

Matt stands staring up at the Martyr suit framed in its
spotlights Shock and awe

He’s never seen anything like this before No one has

STEPHANIE
Matt MATT-

Theyre a crackle of electricity all over the suit and then
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CATCHES MATT FLUSH IN THE CHEST FLINGING
HIM BACKWARDS LIKE A RAGDOLL

AIELLO
BRING IT DOWN BRING IT DOWN

Dozens of agents and marines emerge from the smoke GUNS
RAISED and open fire on the Martyr suit simultaneously
dozens of bullets sparking and bouncing off it-

-but evidence of damage is present IMMEDIATELY the suit is
meant to fight Matt not the army and it’s taking some
serious hits here

Miranda has no choice she fires back blindly at the military
with all weapons-

Bad idea
STEPHANIE
NOT ENOUGH LIGHT IT
UP

A barrage of grenades and rockets flies in KNOCKING THE
MARTYR SUIT AROUND LIKE A WHIRLING DERVISH

Inside the suit we see the various panels and displays
cracking sirens going off The Martyr suit isn’t built to
confront conventional weapons

Miranda inside the suit sereeches in psychotic anger and
frustration

The suit LAUNCHES INTO THE AIR speeding away in full
retreat

The military slowly creeps forward

SLAM TO
FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA
It’s frantic and shaky with Matt on a gurney in an
ambulance Stephanie at his side EMTs are working on him an
oxygen mask on his face

People are running and talking everywhere it’s a mess

FROM HOSPITAL ROOM CAMS

INT CLEAN ROOM

Several different cameras have been set up for clinical
observation like he’s a lab rat Matt is in a hospital bed
the only thing in the room it clearly wasn’t really intended
for this purpose

Hanson sits next to the bed deep in thought Matt stirs
and he sits up

Matt’s groggy and pained
Blue (mmddyyyy)

HANSON
Hey kid

MATT

Hey
(long beat)

Are my parents okay

HANSON
(beat)

MATT
Are they alive

HANSON
Yes Mom’s got three broken ribs
dad’s right arm and leg are broken
Both of them have hearing damage

Matt lays still processing this

HANSON (CONT’D)
Someone’s here to speak to you if

MATT
Shouldnt you be working

HANSON

MATT

wanted everything to be okay

HANSON

MATT
-You know when I first met you
I thought you were a real uptight
asshole

Matt laughs trying to get up slowly painfully and Hanson
goes to him helping him into a sitting position

FF HH

HANSON
Yeah and I thought you were an
immature megalomaniac

Matt laughs Hanson helps Matt to his feet

HANSON (CONTD)
Turns out we were both right

FROM INTERROGATION ROOM CAMERAS

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

The room has a plain steel table a two way mirror and three
chairs It’s sparseexcept for the little automated clicks
and whirrs of the five wall and ceiling mounted cameras

Matt notices every single one We can feel him seething
against them so can Hanson

HANSON
Easy

MATT
Psh

The door opens and two marines step in armed with high
powered rifles and then after a moment

GENERAL POOL late 40s enters He’s an immaculately clean
man wearing the uniform of a four star general There’s
something bright and aware about him we’re looking at an
officer’s officer the absolute cream of the crop

He holds a large file folder

Hanson stands and salutes and Matt hurriedly stands as well
not really sure whether to salute or not awkward Pool
simply looks at them both

HANSON
General Pool Something wrong
sir

GENERAL POOL
I understood he
wasincapacitated hospitalized-

HANSON
Kid’s a fast healer
Blue (mmddyyyy) 72

GENERAL POOL
I am attempting to give you
sensitive information there were
certain parameters for the delivery
of this information

MATT
What you thought you were gonna
read me a bedtime story

Pool takes a beat and gives a thin tight-lipped smile

MATT (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I- sorry

GENERAL POOL
You both can go ahead and take a
seat

Hanson nods and sits down next to Matt who still pained
slumps down next to him Pool sits across from them
glancing at them cameras

It forms an odd sort of tableau it almost looks like a
single dad and his son at a parent teacher conference

Pool opens his folder drawing out a picture of Miranda
Hodgkins

MATT
This is her this is her
(to Hanson)
That’s her holy shit-

Matt falls quiet listening as Pool talks the excited look
on his face gradually falls to one of blank confusion

GENERAL POOL
Miranda Hodgkins french
expatriate is by our numbers one
of the most intelligent people on
the planet-—

MATT
Wait stop you know who she is
She’s like a- she’s like a known
thing
(shocked beat)
What -

GENERAL POOL
Let me finish
Blue (mmddyyyy) 73

MATT
Let you FINISH-

HANSON
Matt come on

Matt looks to Hanson who stares at him cool as a cucumber
He goes quiet

General Pool begins pushing out documents and photographs
from the file playing them out like solitaire

GENERAL POOL
At age seven Miranda was pulled out
of public school Both her and her
sister tested at genius level but
only Miranda was inducted into the
Project Opal

MATT
Opal-

GENERAL POOL
Opal has existed since 1961 the
purpose of the program being to
locate gather integrate and
educate children of exceptional
intellect to better serve the
interests of the United States of
America-

MATT
Some military genius school
what’re you- Hanson c’mon this is
some conspiracy shit man-

GENERAL POOL
Around age thirteen Miranda began
to show signs of some kind of
behavioral or mental disorder

He shows pictures of Miranda’s crazed writings a young
Miranda covered in equations not unlike what we were seeing
in Jacks house not-so-long-ago

GENERAL POOL (CONTD)
By the time she was seventeen she
had manifested delusional paranoia
as well as intense and
unpredictable moodswings She was
formally diagnosed with
schizophrenia and bipolar and
summarily removed from the active
program
Blue (mmddyyyy) 74

MATT
-So for ten years you were
teaching this psycho to do WHAT
exactly

GENERAL POOL
(beat)
Engineering Cybernetics
Mathematical Physics-

MATT
Oh so just the basics then-

GENERAL POOL
About two years after she left the
program Miranda met this man Jack
Fisk

MATT
(covering his face)
Holy shit holy shit-

GENERAL POOL

Fisk was an ex-con an anarchist
with a long history of bad
behavior

(beat)
His brother Terrance Fisk was
killed in the incident in Seattle

(beat)
Miranda became we think obsessed
with him and in turn after
Seattle gradually adopted his
fledgling psychosis
regardingyou

Matt is frantically trying to remain calm he’s passed anger
by a mile and is now making the slow arc through complete
shock His head his hanging

MATT
How long have you known about this

GENERAL POOL
Six months When Miranda hacked
the Haven Hills server and pirated
the footage from Andrew Detmer’s
camera and the Seattle Catastrophe-

HANSON
-Slow down why wasn’t I informed
about this-

ee FH HH

Blue (mmddyyyy)

GENERAL POOL
We tracked the style of the hacking
back to Project Opal and found
that Hodgkins and Fisk were living
together in Los Angeles-

HANSON
No I said slow down Why wasn’t I
informed about this

GENERAL POOL
Mr Hanson this is above your

You knew that they were doing- she
was building that thing-

something having to do with you-

MATT
You knew So when they released
that movie when they attacked
mewhen she tried to murder my
parents- You knew
(genuinely flummoxed)
Why

Pool gives a polite smile closing the file

GENERAL POOL

For eight months the Garretty
issue has been hotly debated We
can’t seem to find a clean
mechanism to control inhibit or
even predict your movements You
show no respect for authority and
move without consequence And
thusly there is an interest at
the highest level in some form of
deterrent

(beat)
Against you

(beat)
We felt it best to allow Miss
Hodgkins to continue her research
until such she’d developed
something we could use should your
erratic behavior ever turn
dangerous

MATT

uncontrollably and lurches forward into Polly’s arms

stalks towards Matt who’s holding his telekinetic ground
leading to a tremendous amount of splash damage all around
him which our camera-holding pedestrians have to frantically
dodge

Matt flicks his wrists and two cars launch from either side
of the street SANDWICHING the Martyr suit between them

It falls but then knocks the cars away and OPENS UP WITH THE
SONIC WEAPONS Matt lurches staggering as car windows
shatter and car alarms go off all around him

The suit slowly steps forward getting closerand closer
The sonics KICK INTO HIGH GEAR street lights shattering
several of the camera lenses cracking Matt dropping to his
knees

Matt screaming in agony begins crawling away as the Martyr
suit stalks towards him his nose is bleeding badly and we
realize he’s helpless

The Lightning Bug begins to rev CHARGING UP

This is it Matt’s going to die

Just like Andrew died Angry alone and scared

A GOVERNMENT TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE MARTYR SUIT smashing it to
the ground THE SONIC WEAPONS ARE DESTROYED IN THE IMPACT
shattering and shutting off

Matt confused and in pain watches as Hanson () carrying
an automatic shotgun hops out of the drivers’ side
perfectly calm and walks around to the Martyr suit which is
trying weakly to lift the truck off it

Hanson raises the shotgun and fires into the suit’s “face”
three times the hits are so direct it actually does damage

MATT
Hanson GET OUT OF HERE Get away
from it

HANSON

FLY AWAY YOU
(points to the sky)

FLY AWAY

MATT
No Hanson RUN You have to run
go

Hanson calmly goes around to the side of the still struggling
suit and jams the shotgun into the “elbow” of the Martyr’s
left arm and fires BAM and again BAM

The arm sparks and lets off jets of hydraulic steam
breaking Hanson goes around to the other arm

HANSON
Miranda Hodgkins deactivate the
weapon and come out with your hands-

Miranda inside the suit screams in incoherent rage and
then SWINGS THE RIGHT ARM SMASHING HANSON TO THE GROUND
pinning him under its “hand”

The impact is shocking it’s as though he was hit by a car
and he lays motionless on the cracked asphalt

MATT
No No

One of the gattling gun “arms” comes up and Matt is suddenly
on it RIPPING IT CLEAN OFF IN A LOUD SHOWER OF FIRE AND
SPARKS

Miranda inside the suit shrieks in anger as alarms and
sirens go off all around her

She spins in time to see the Ferris wheel TIP AND
FALL CRUSHING THE MARTYR SUIT UNDER IT

Matt stumbles wiping his nose-

eight limbs trembling before-

SUIT INTO ALL OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS IN A BURST OF SPARKS

approaches it and it’s peeled open like a can of beans
exposing Miranda inside

You took everything from me

Matt pantomimes not being able to hear Miranda as she begs
him cupping his hand to his ear and then flicks his hand at
her one of the severed arms of the suit flips up and smashes
her down

We can hear the people filming react with horror

He stalks towards as she slowly begins trying to crawl her
way out from under the arm

straight unmitigated unfiltered malevolence

Miranda collapses in a heap That impact broke bones maybe

anger slowly fades

into horror He looks around at the wrecked pier the
fires burning in the distance on 3rd streetJesus christ
what did he do

He takes one last look at Miranda and then launches off into
the air

Miranda’s crumpled form stirs Our closer angles show that
she’s coughing up blood barely able to move

Police cars and government vehicles are rallying at the far
end of the pier Helicopters are everywhere in the sky

Matt was right It’s over

People begin to creep forward towards her our cameras
getting closer when-

Sonic BOOM Matts back Everybody hurriedly backs up before
refocusing

He lands next to Miranda standing over her silent staring
at her She reaches out weakly pulling at his pant leg and
then collapses going limp

By god is she

He kneels down next to her We can see Matt’s lips but not
hear him as he picks up the dying Miranda in his arms

Matt places a hand on her chest saying something His nose
begins to drip blood The camera zooms in something is
