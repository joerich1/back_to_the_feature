For those complacent optimists who have not
yet learned to live as we do in the kingdom
of despair that first quick glimpse of
failure must always seem like a vision of
death itself

S G Nechayev (1847-1882)

You can forget about cataloguing my virtues
I hold them to a minimum so theyre easy to
keep track of

Puts a hand to his throbbing temple Stops frowns

There is something WRITTEN on the palm of his hand
With a permanent marker in an unmistakably feminine script

“YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY

A BLACK CAT darts out of a nearby bush
Crosses right in front of March Out into the street

Something very weird happens then

They get the cabinet open Inside is a heavy canvas BAG -

HEALY

Turns Toms face an impossible shocking BLUE -

At which point through the floor comes the BIGGEST BUZZ
YET of LAUGHTER Like a sitcom soundtrack

HEALY

TOM snarls Savagely wipes his face on a kitchen towel
Crosses to the AQUARIUM dips his face scrubs --

HEALY
Tried to tell you

Tom stops His still-blue face dripping wet Looks at Healy

TOM
You tried to tell me

TOM reaches in the tank grabs a TROPICAL FISH -- FLINGS it
across the room It SMACKS the wall wetly Next to Healy

HEALY
Come on the fish Dont do that

Healy appeals to the older guy
HEALY

There is an ENVELOPE taped to the underside of the desk

indecipherable doctors scrawl But a few words jump out at us

Shifts to his knees -- duck-walks in a circle searching
Intent focused -- UNAWARE of a new ARRIVAL A VOICE says

VOICE (os)
Is this what youre looking for

March FREEZES The voice stops him cold

Weve seen this moment before in movies -- so has he
He raises his hand Swallows hard Turns defeated

What he doesnt expect is a guy dressed as a HIPPY

The HIPPY Guy wiggles the bottle ptovo- atively

MARCH

Bingo He finds it Stands up checking the weapon over
Takes a step back--

AND TRIPS OVER SOMEONE

HIS GUN GOES OFF just as he falls on his ass BLAM BLAM

The shots MUFFLED in all the party noise--
No one upstairs even seems to have noticed

March sits in the dirt Slack-jawed Blinking

He just shot someone In the chest Twice Thats the bad news
The good news is the guy was already dead

This is so rad My dads gonna shit when
he hears I found you

Alice darts a look in her rear-view mirror
ALICE
Damnit

HEADLIGHTS Behind them catching up fast--
Alice is flooring it -Giving it everything

She corners again now DOING 50 THIS TIME

The NOVA fishtailing -- shuddering
Holly goes tumbling again and--

THE TOWN CAR
Makes the turn with ease And now its bearing down Fast

Alice panicked Sees a sidestreet
Mind you now it aint a’right its a HARD right--

No hesitation She FLINGS them into a skid
Slews around the bend Tires squawling

Almost makes it
THE TOWN CAR

Is just too close With no time to react
-- WHAM -- It clips the back of the Nova-

And the two cars LOCK UP

Start spinning crazy 360s Locked together our ‘OF CONTROL
The whole world goes soundless and dreamy

Holly staring as the scenery flies past in a BLUR
She looks over in time to see--

-- SLAM -- The TOWN CAR sheered away Smashes into a LIGHTPOLE

One second its there The next its left behind as-

The Nova keeps going Skidding Sliding Executes a lazy
pirouette 180 degrees Pitches sideways into acurb -- SMACK

Promptly dies

A beat Another beat Alice blinks her senses returning
And then she snaps into action Frantically trying to restart
the car The engine chugging and chuffing--

ALICE
-Comeon commie on

Tosses a glance at Holly andstops cold--
HOLLY is very still STARING straight ahead
Shocked expression Alice follows her gaze--

THEIR POV -- THE TOWN CAR

20 yards away Wrecked against a tree Headlights shining” ASKEW
One pointed up one down The HOOD sheared upward Folded in
half Broken glass in a 30foot circumference around the car
The driver is dead Pulped headmess vaguely in view

All this sinks in as the girls look on aghast

‘And then Hollys gaze is abruptly riveted--
Drawn to a solitary LUMP in the roadway Still twitching ALIVE

BLUE TOM CRUISE

Flailing in the middle of the road Bloody Aimless
His leg twisted at sickening angle

Alice looks away Blocking it out She tries the engine
again It kicks over Car ROARS’to life--

She looks up in time to see Holly EXIT THE CAR

ALICE
What the hell are you doing

Holly glances back

HOLLY ve
Hes HURT Just just hang on

She starts down the street Alice calls after her
ALICE
Are you crazy Get back here Get away
from him
Holly just keeps going Approaches the downed man--
Hes a mess iy
Looks like he was ejected through ‘the windshield
Covered in glass hé wheezes air in raw lungfuls

Alice is yelling out the window now

ALICE -
Goddamnit Im leaving Get back here

Just then TOM rolls over gasping SEES HOLLY
She stops hesitant Noticing for the first time

TOMS GUN RESTS FIVE FEET AWAY

Holly stares Is that what-he was going for
She turns to call back to Alice--
Is greeted by a piercing SCREECH OF TIRES -as emphatically

ALICE GOES AWAY
At top speed Right now shes got anywhere else to be

BLUE FACE meanwhile is staring detached Eyes fixed on
Holly Uncomprehending He reaches out a hand for her

Holly makes a decision a re
Ignores the gun Steps up next to Tom Takes his hand

HOLLY
Its okay Youre gonna be alright
Ill get help
Tom swallows Draws a ragged breath says
TOM
Fucked up Sorry Now now they

call John Boy Hell kill you Sorry

He lapses semi-conscious as Holly looks around the
darkened neighborhood

HOLLY
Hello I need help Somebody GET HELP

And we start to PULL BACK now as the sound of LAUGHTER swells
on the soundtrack -- followed by APPLAUSE A voice intones

LORRAINE NEWMAN (os)
Live from New York its SATURDAY NIGHT

INT BARNEYS BEANERY - NIGHTTIME
A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE rerun plays on a TV mounted above the bar

While at the bar a LONE MAN sits hunched over his drink
like it’s his pet rabbit We see him from behind

ANNOUNCER’ (os)
Ladies and Gentleman Michael Sarrazin

ON TV 70s heartthrob actor MICHAEL SARRAZIN bounds onto stage
for his monologue -- A DRUNK GIRL at the bar reacts visibly

DRUNK GIRL
Wow Hes yummy

The LONE MAN meanwhile tries to get the bartenders attention

MAN
Hey Harv I was watching the soccer
DRUNK GIRL
No wait I wanna see this Michael
Parrafin hes adorable
(frowns)
What ever happened to him

Camera rotates to reveal the LONE MAN as he fishes out a
cigarette sparks his lighter -- illuminating his face

One look and we instantly recognize him -- hes an older
version of the man giving the monologue on screen
Hes Michael Sarrazin 63 years old now And infinitely weary

(Note If Mr Sarrazin is unavailable we ll find another
actor of that same era)

SARRAZIN
Actually he died

DRUNK GIRL

Sarrazin downs the last of his drink Clinks ice cubes at- her

SARRAZIN
Drank himself to death

Wheezing asthmatic laughter -- the kind you think youre
gonna pass out the jokes so fucking funny

HEALY leans out cautiously Just in time to see
A SUITED MAN

‘Stumbling ‘toward him Weaving side to side
Equilibrium gone Wheeze Stumble

Healy draws a sharp breath

From the guys collar a sad little spritz
Like a kids drinking fountain Bright blood Arterial

HIS THROATS BEEN CUT

Guy collides with the wall Eyes pleading with Healy
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS NOW

These from the OTHER direction MARCH stares eyes wide--
A SIMILARLY DRESSED MAN

Comes rocketing out of a side corridor
Spins Headed their way--

Three loud sharp REPORTS
BULLETS rip through his mid- section--

The window behind him ‘cracked Splattered He SCREAMS and
the WHEEZER keeps on wheezing and all is blood and chaos--

HEALY doesnt say a word Never changes expression

Leans back into the elevator Reaches past March--

Pushes the Lobby button
The doors glide shut erasing the ‘corridor

OUTSIDE

THE PICTURE WINDOW right next to the elevator CRACKS --
As the gut-shot MAN is HURLED against it

Muzak plays soothing The elevator starts down

Healy slides the brass knuckles off

Stashes them in a pocket

Doesnt notice until the figure actually says something

EXT SARRAZINS HOUSE - BACK WITH MARCH

March is running full-out DOWN THE STREET Carrying the RIFLE
from his attacker Up ahead just coming int6 view

What looks like a MILITARY ASSAULT on Sarrazins house
An incredible BARRAGE OF FIRE coming from the hillside above --

March points his barrel in that general direction
Squeezes off two shots -- BAMBAM --

The machinegun fire stops Just like that
Pause Pause March stares up at the darkness

Maybe he got in a lucky shot--
Then suddenly a fresh volley of GUNFIRE opens up
Now its aimed at MARCH

MARCH
Shit

He dives for cover Flips over a low STONE WALL as
BACK INSIDE - WITH HEALY

Sensing the reprieve Healy instantly takes advantage
Grabs Holly races headlong into the KITCHEN --

EXT HILLSIDE - BACK OF HOUSE - WITH ALICE
The raw echo of GUNFIRE carries on the night air

Alice is scrabbling to get the hell out of there when
behind her quite suddenly --
MIKE SARRAZIN drops into frame -- WHOMPH --
Hits and rolls like a paratrooper Slides to a dusty ‘stop-

ALICE looks back still crawling

ALICE
Please dont kill me

Sarrazin rolls his eyes Hauls her toher feet --
SARRAZIN
Shhh Nobody wants to kill you
to himself)

Actually thats not quite true but
EXT STONE WALL - MARCH TAKING COVER
Hes under a shitload of fire now
Rock dust BLASTED UP in a choking CLOUD
His protective wall CHEWED by artillery
Dammit wheres it coming from-- He strains to see

Steals a look at the HILLSIDE Tries to get a fix on 1 the
gunner In doing so he SPOTS something--

There in a neighbors back yard Might be his only chance’
Deep breath then--

He ROLLS OUT FROM BEHIND COVER Aims -the rifle

Its been awhile since he was proficient with an AR-15
Before he drank to be honest

He sights in on a GAS BARBECUE Fires BLAM--

Blows the PROPANE TANK

Trust us thesé things arent finicky any ‘high caliber slug
will do the trick

A sudden WHOOSH-- Fire arcs thirty feet INTO THE SKY
SEARS the eyeball turns night into DAY --
Illuminates for a split second

THE DARK SILHOUETTE

Of the source the hidden GUNNER March targets him and -
starts pulling the trigger -- BLAM BLAM BLAM --

The man reacts DIVING for cover meanwhile od
EXT HOUSE - WITH HEALY and HOLLY

Theyre outside the kitchen door now

104

Moving quiiy along the side of the house They hear the
gunfire ce Huddle in the shadows just this side of the
front yard Listening

FOOTSTEPS approaching Healy braces Timing it just right
SPRINGS Almost takes off MARCHS HEAD --

MARCH
Hey Hey Its me

Healy pulls back just in time
Holly runs out practically jumps on her father

SIRENS can be heard nowin the distance

HEALY

EXT HILLSIDE - WITH SARRAZIN AND ALICE

Sarrazin is helping Alice make it down the hillside --
SIRENS getting louder Se

He catches sight of something through the trees to
A CAR Parked on the road Police flasher on the roof

SARRAZIN-
(lets out a breath)
Thank the Lord
(to Alice)
Hang on
ANGLE ON -ROAD

SARRAZIN comes huffing up the side of the hill
Runs over to the car--

“SARRAZIN-
Hey Hello

Theres no one in the car Sarrazin frowns Walks around back --
The trunk is OPEN back here Inside

A MOLDED BLACK SUITCASE

The kind used to carry dis-assembled assault weapons
Sarrazin blinks at it Hears something behind him --

Someone approaching on the gravel

And suddenly Sarrazins face is transformed

He suddenly looks just like anyone out for a night stroll
He turns to greet the silhouetted figure with a smile

BEHIND HIS BACK he starts waggling his hand urgently
Waving off ALICE letting her know its not right

SARRAZIN
Officer hey I guess someone else
called about all this racket huh

ALICE WATCHES FROM COVER

Seéing Mikes frantic signals she gets the drift
Turns runs the other way and consequently

MISSES MIKES PERFORMANCE
As an easygoing neighbor Completely casual now

SARRAZIN
You know my wife swears its gunfire
I told her it was probably just some
asshole firing up their new motorboat or
something

(beat)

Hey can I lodge a noise complaint with
you I swear this shits been going on
for weeks

The man stands for a moment staring at Sarrazin Finally says

COP
That was good Youre a good actor
Sarrazin sighs nods You can see it he knows hes not
gonna walk away from this He smiles says
SARRAZIN

Yeah Glad someone noticed
The man raises his ASSAULT RIFLE --

EXT LOS ANGELES STREET - DOWNTOWN DAY

Another perfect day in the city we all love
CAMERA PANS DOWN from an impossible BLUE SKY

To a political rally SIGNS and BANNERS everywhere
Shoemaker for President Shoemaker a Shoe-in

‘THE MAN HIMSELF

Pushes through the crowd beaming
Handshakes shoulder-pats as he moves toward the stage --

Quite suddenly a young girl appearsin his path
He bends down with a grin

SHOEMAKER
‘Hello there little girl Are your
parents going to vote for me

HOLLY MARCH smiles at him Leans in to whisperin his ear

Intimately close - Slips something in the politicians
POCKET and utters just two words

HOLLY
Youre fucked

Shoemaker RECOILS Choe
Holly smiles at him again Turns moves off --
Within seconds shes lost to Sight ce

The crowd surges pushing their candidaté ‘onwatd He feels in

his pocket clasps something Fishes it out

A TINY BLACK CYLINDER

The kind used to store a roll of film Shoemaker blinks at it

“130

Pops the lid reaches inside» - withdraws STRIP OF- FOUR PHOTOS

The kind you get for a buck at any photo booth
SUZY AND ALICE

Taken recently Happy Smiling
A memento of their brief reunion

Shoemaker just stares at the pictures

Crowds pushing all around him Calling his name
All of a sudden he looks very lost

CUT TO
TV IMAGE - FUZZY WITH SCAN LINES

Were watching an interview
ALICE speaking to an off-camera newsman

NEWSMAN os)
- So prior to meeting you Suzy -

Shoemaker had no inkling that her family

lineage lay elsewhere mote

ALICE
How could she I mean whats Shoemaker
gonna say that hes a criminal her
lifes based on a lie

CAMERAS PULLS BACK NOW
Widening to reveal the TV bolted to a wall

On screen we see ALICES FACE vanish--
Replaced by a slick-looking news anchor in studio

- NEWS ANCHOR
That story took us by surprise séven days
ago Tonight an even bigger surprise the
unprecedented outpouring of support for
David Shoemaker It maybe too early to
call with only 60 percent of the
precincts reporting -- but indicators’
depict a Shoemaker victory in
California And withit the subséquent
nomination for President mo
Now SHOEMAKER is’on screen Behind him-children play
- SHOEMAKER
Team deeply moved that the public has
seen fit to reject those who in the

eleventh hour would summon deceit and
sabotage as their allies

Weve widened to reveal a dimly lit BARTOP °

MARCH is folded across it like a man clutching a life raft With
intense concentration hes writeson-his hand with a BLACK PEN

YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY

March writes ina delicate almost feminine Scrawl
The ‘bartender looks up- as HEALY enters Crosses to the bar
Stops next to March who turns bleary-eyed
MARCH
- Its you

‘HRALY
Holly told me where youd be

MARCH
Ah Guess youre here to tell me what
an asshole I-am for having a little
drink huh i
Healy takes the seat next to March

i HEALY
Not today Im not

He signals the bartender

HEALY
Scotch please

March regards his friend with drunken incredulity
The bartender sets a rink in- front of Healy
(raises the glass)
To the next four- years

A beat Then March raises his own glass
Healy knocks his drink back Feels the burn down his gullet

CUT TO BLACK

Hold a beat Then from the ‘surrounding dark -- CROWD noise
Soft at first Loud Louder CRESCENDO as we FADE IN

INT AMBASSADOR HOTEL- ‘MAIN BALLROOM - NIGHT

The crowds are PACKED into the beautiful Ambassador Hotel
(Yes we know this ‘place-has been closed ‘down We dont care)

ON STAGE

David Shoemaker bounds into view to THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE He
soaks up all the adulation for a moment Quiets the audience

Lod SHOEMAKER - Ds
“I think weknow enough’ to’ say’ with’ some
certainty that California tonight has
made David ‘Shoemaker the coméback kid

ROARS OF APPROVAL greet this People jumping up and down
hooting -- youve seen these fucking things right

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALLROOM

March and Healy stand Getting jostled
Glaring up at the stage with disgust

SHOEMAKER
The truth is unassailable People know in
-their hearts when theyre hearing truth
Tonight Im hearing it in the outpouring
of faith and support from you people
People to whom one day soon I will
‘pledge all my heart and all my spirit

The assembled masses go nuts They just love this guy
Healy cant take it anymore

HEALY
Letts get the fuck out of here

March stares a moment longer Radiating hate Finally nods
The two men turn Start making their way out

In the background framed between the two of them anOUT OF
FOCUS SHOEMAKER continues on his tirade--

And then suddenly theres a loud sharp -- BAM --
And David Shoemakers head explodes

It all plays in the background Out of focus
But we know instantly whats happened -- hes been shot

CHAOS and fucking BEDLAM
All the CHEERING turns to SCREAMING in an instant

Healy and March stop dead in their tracks Turning around
trying to make sense of what the fuck just happened

Shoemaker slumped on the floor Dead

And people are pointing now SCREAMING and YELLING and pointing
up at a balcony near the back of the room

March and Healy spin simultaneously Crowds SURGING around them
SECRET SERVICE
Materializes out of nowhere

SIX GUYS in suits -- they go barreling up the stairs
Behind them more men A swirl of confusion

Healy ‘isteiihe first one to notice it
A SECURITY GUARD

At the base of a staircase back here Pointing up the stairs--
Otherwise not doing much of anything

Backing away Unnoticed in the pandemonium

He lowers his arm turning--

LOCKS EYES WITH MARCHAND HEALY

Its John Boy

Features partially hidden under the guaxa s visor and dark
glasses Just the SINGLE MOLE as a dead giveaway

Time stands still

All the people around him moving in hyper- -real slow mot ion-
As John Boy gives the two men the briefest of nods

Then were back to full speed as he’ turns
And disappears into the crowd

March and Healy stare dumbfounded A pause
People running every which way Passing’ through frame

“March and Healy just continue to stare

HEALY
Ill be a son of a--

CUT TO BLACK

THE END
