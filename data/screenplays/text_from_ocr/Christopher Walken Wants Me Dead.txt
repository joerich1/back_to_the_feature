OVER BLACK

We hear a lion roaring and MIKE screaming

EXT

MIKE
Please don’t kill me Please don’t
kill me
ZOO NIGHT

CUT TO

Through Mike’s POV we see an upside down lion The camera
turns and we see CHRISTOPHER WALKEN laughing maniacally

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
It’s just a little pussy cat Mikey
Don’t you like pussy cats

MIKE
No Please don’t kill me Please
don’t kill me

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
I’m not going to kill you Mikey
Him he might But not me Mikey
You and me go way back Remember

Again Christopher Walken begins to laugh like a crazy
person And we FREEZE FRAME on CU of his face

MIKE (VO)
Yesterday I was just another
Hollywood wannabe There’s a
million out there just like me You
know the type We do what we have
to do to get by but our focus
what we’re really chasing it’s the
ultimate fantasy the big screen A
few actually make it They have the
talent and the lucky breaks to go
with it Yesterday I thought I had
finally gotten my big break Boy
was I wrong Cause I’m not
dreaming this is no fantasy and
Christopher Walken wants me dead

We UNFREEZE the CU of Christopher Walken and

CUT

TO
INT STUDIO EXEC’S OFFICE DAY

Mike is just finishing up a pitch to a studio exec for his
most recent script Mike is a decent looking guy in his late
twenties He is doing the best he can to dress to impress
but his shirt and pants are a little wrinkled and his cheap
tie doesn’t have the best of knots

MIKE
And that about wraps it up It’s a
strong story broad marketability
I think if you put the right A List
actor in there you could have a
blockbuster

STUDIO EXEC
Hmmm I’11 be honest with you I
love it

MIKE
Really

STUDIO EXEC
Yeah I do It’s fantastic

MIKE
That’s great

STUDIO EXEC
The thing is I’m not sure the
timing is right for us to doa
picture like this

MIKE
Oh OK

STUDIO EXEC
I tell you what though let me hold
on to your script

MIKE
OK Great Hey Thanks for your
time

STUDIO EXEC
No problem

After the studio exec turns Mike down we go through a series
of JUMP CUTS of additional studio execs giving feedback to
Mike in other pitch sessions
STUDIO EXEC 2
Let me think about it

STUDIO EXEC 3
I’m going to show it to some
people

STUDIO EXEC 4
This has big potential
(beat)
Let me get back to you on it

STUDIO EXEC 5
I’1ll get back to you

STUDIO EXEC 6
I’1ll get back to you

STUDIO EXEC 7
I’1ll get back to you

CUT TO

INT MIKE’S APT DAY

Mike enters what just barely passes as his one bedroom
apartment The walls are cracked the floor is warped and
the decorations are sparse He throws his things on a small
coffee table and shuffles to the kitchen He opens the
refrigerator that holds nothing more than a few condiments
an old Chinese takeout container and a single beer that has
already been opened and half finished

Mike pulls out the beer and the Chinese food He opens the
takeout container and smells it to see if it is still edible
The grimace on his face makes it clear the food should have
been thrown out long ago Mike leaves the Chinese food
sitting on the counter grabs the beer and shuffles back to
the front of the apartment and collapses on his old ratty
sofa

Mike takes a sip of the beer and grimaces again The beer
should have been thrown out with the Chinese He sets it on
his coffee table and leans back in the sofa rubbing his hands
on his face and groaning Mike gives a final grimace then
falls over sideways on the sofa face down He is ready to
put this day behind him even though the next one will
probably just hold more of the same

As Mike lays on the sofa the exterior light goes from
daylight to dark indicating that several hours have gone by
INT MIKES APT EVENING

WILL (V0O)

Pockets are here

INT ET LATE AFTERNOON

JEAN PAUL the snooty French maitre d’ of the see and be seen
restaurant Et (pronounced ‘eat’) is hurriedly walking
through his restaurant and showing the new hostess JEN all of
the different stations just before the restaurant opens He
points out different areas as Jen struggles to keep up and
retain all of the information Jean Paul points out as they
start in the main dining room move to the VIP room race
through the kitchen and end at the hostess station in front

JEAN PAUL
Et is not any ordinary restaurant

browsing it she returns her attention back to the voice on
the other end of the phone

JEN

Walken

Jean Paul’s face changes to horror as he realizes that Jen is
about to deny this Mr Walken a table

JEAN PAUL
Wait wait wait Walken What is his
first name

Jean Paul gasps in disbelief that Christopher Walken desires
an evening at his restaurant

JEAN PAUL

premier list everything else is
easy as pie We’re here and this
is the place where deals are made
Look around you mate Only the big
boys here yeah

ARI

Now that is not the right attitude
As far as they’re concerned we
are Look everyone in here is
someone is in one of two groups
The first group consists of big
players in the entertainment
business

ARI
Not us

ROMAN
Exactly Because we are in the
exclusive second group consisting
of people who everyone in the first
group thinks are big players in the
entertainment industry

ARI
But doesn’t everyone in the first
group know everyone else in the
first group

ROMAN
Exactly

We cut to a different shot in the same restaurant with Jean
Paul who in mid sentence walking through the kitchen
checking to make sure that everything is up to the high
standards he sets He tastes soups checks for dust and gunk
and makes sure all the staff are dressed correctly

JEAN PAUL
Big night everyone Big night

standards and all of his requests
must be accommodated

Jean Paul takes a spoon and tastes some soup

Jean Paul continues walking and stops a server walking by
him

WILL

some scotch tape

We see Wes’s face and see that his “disguise” is nothing
more than scotch tape placed all over his face to distort his
characteristics His eyebrows are pulled sideways His nose
and eyelids pulled up his lips pried open

WILL
You need help

legal

POCKETS

WILL
Mike this is all just one big
misunderstanding

POCKETS
Guys

Having finally gotten their attention everyone looks at

Ari have gotten out of the car and popped the hood

2 SHOT OF ROMAN AND ARI LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD FROM THE
ENGINE’S POV

Looks like an engine to me

As Roman and Ari contemplate Mike and his friends walk up
behind them

slamming their heads on the hood

ROMAN
Mike Guys So glad to see you
mates You live around here then

ARI
Cause we were just coming to see
you

WILL
Is that right

ROMAN
I thought the meeting today went
spectacular

ARI

Chris is ready to make a deal

MIKE
Did he decide that before or after
the gang shooting

ROMAN
Oh bollocks Mike There was just
the one bloke

MIKE
I fail to see how that matters
What matters is you putting us in
the middle of a Mexican standoff

ARI
He’s actually Cuban

MIKE
Whatever

ROMAN
Mike Thick as thieves those two
are It’s the way they do things
They were testing you And you
passed with flying colors mate
Tell him Ari

ARI
I think he can see for himself

ROMAN
What’s that

At this point everyone realizes that Walken has pulled up
next to everyone in his limo He rolls down the window and
we can see Eduardo with him

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Hi guys

The site of Walken rolling up with Eduardo takes everyone by
surprise Roman and Ari are the first two to take off

ROMAN
Run

The two men take off down a side alley Realizing the two men
are the key to straightening everything out Mike and his
friends take chase behind them

MIKE
Don’t let them get away

When Roman and Ari get to the end of the alley they hit a
dead end and are forced to either turn right or left Roman
goes right and Ari to the left

Following close behind is Mike and his friends Mike points
Wes and Pockets in the direction of Ari while he chases
Roman with Will

MIKE
We need them both You guys go that
way Will let’s get Roman

JEN
What can I do Mike

MIKE
Duck behind here When it’s clear
go after Gunther He doesn’t know
you know anything Find out if he
knows who did it

glimpse of Roman up ahead

alley in hot pursuit

only car there is Walken’s

Will and gang including a still unconscious Eduardo run out
of the bus towards the door which is of course locked for
the night

WES
We can’t get in this way

WILL
That way

Will points towards a fence going around the zoo

ROMAN
Youre just going to jump the
bloody fence keeping us out and
more importantly the caged animals
in

WILL
What never taken a shortcut

Will runs towards the gate and in an unexpected feat of
acrobatic skill (and a nod to “Shaun of the Dead”) he scales
the fence as if it were nothing and throws himself to the
other side

Roman and Ari look at each other then back at the fence
then back at each other

ROMAN
Right

Roman and Ari run straight for the fence but when they are
about halfway up the fence gives way and crashes forward
along with Roman and Ari

cutting edge risk taker unless he’s
a safe bet

MIKE
That doesn’t really make any

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Mike When I was at my first job

MIKE
Working at the zoo

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Right Well one day this young
boy child came to the zoo While at
the gorilla exhibit he made a
curious discovery He found that
when he beat on his chest the
monkeys they became very agitated
When he kept at it they became so
angry that they began to fling
their poo at the zoo guests

(MORE )

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN (CONTD)
He found this to be very amusing
with one exception

MIKE
He was covered in Gorilla crap

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Correctoamundo So you know what
this young boy did Mikey

MIKE
Uh no

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN

He came back the next day And
again he beat on his chest And
the gorillas hurled their feces
But this time he wore a raincoat

MIKE
So it’s like when life gives you
lemons make lemonade

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
That’s crazy I don’t even know
what that means No When the
primates of the world hurl their
excrement at you have fun with it
Mike this project of yours let’s
make this it happen

on his face

What

At this point Eduardo walks by wearing a dark secret service
looking security guard suit down to the dark glasses but
with its own cuban flair

EDUARDO LACASA
Hey guys

MIKE
Hey Eduardo

WILL
Hey Eduardo

MIKE

He’s not a bad guy to have in your
corner Plus he was going to kill
them

WILL
Yeah I guess But isn’t security
guard kind of a drop from the high
rolling gangster lifestyle

MIKE
He’s a little worried about the
wall going up Figures he’d better
be on his best behavior now

WILL
But the wall is in Mexico

MIKE
Whatever

WILL
OK so after all of that how much
is left over

MIKE
10000

WILL
10000 That’s it

MIKE
That’s what we still owe

WILL
Man Well there’s always the next
one right

MIKE
Always the next one

Christopher Walken walks up to the two guys He is wearing
nothing but a hospital gown and black socks pulled up to his
knees

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Mikey Willamino You little cutie
pies

MIKE
Hey Chris

WILL
Hey Chris I’11 let you guys talk
so I can get everyone ready

MIKE
Sounds good See you on the set

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Mike I just had a great idea about
my character Do you think we can
fit in some improv shots

MIKE
What did you have in mind

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
I feel like when my character is
troubled he should moo like a cow
maybe flatulate and touch himself

MIKE
Uh right Well let’s get the takes
we need then we’1ll see if we can
fit them in Fair

CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
Fantastic

MIKE
Well why don’t we get started

Walken walks over to a hospital bed and gets in it Mike
calls over to Will

MIKE
Want to do the honors

WILL
That’s why I’m here Quiet on the
set Scene 1 take 1
Everyone quiets down and Mike sits in the director’s chair
We see shots of everyone looking at Mike waiting for him to
start the action

We go to a CU on Mike

MIKE
And action
