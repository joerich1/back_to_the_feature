INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOPAUL’S ROOM - DAY 1

We are in a simple small but comfortable hotel room with
bare white walls and worn out but well-kept hardwood floors
There’s a small bed with someone seemingly asleep in it a
desk and a chair in the corner Around the window we see a
faint frame of early morning light but the curtains are
drawn closed keeping the room dark and tranquil

After a few seconds we notice a quiet but steady sound
“drip drip drip” breaking the absolute silence

On the bed PAUL GAGNE has his eyes open awake in the
darkness A light-haired Frenchman in his mid 30’s he
listens to the steady beat of water falling one drop after
the next into a lonesome metal can

He can hear a piano start to play in the distance

EXT STREETSSINTRA - DAY 2

It’s morning of a Fall day in Sintra the ancient Portuguese
city on the hills not far from Lisbon For centuries this
was the summer retreat for the local aristocracy The ornate
towers of various castles each in its own architectural
style are seen above the more typical Colonial-era buildings
that make up the heart of the town There’s green all around
from its famous lush gardens The effect is romantic - almost
fairy tale

The streets are still quiet in town It’s early in the
morning The tour buses have not yet arrived The lucky
tourists who managed to get a room in town are still asleep
Well not all of them JAMES “JIMMY” MANUS a robust
Irishman early 60’s tall and gentle strolls amongst a few
LOCALS Looking down hands in his pockets he is deep in
thought It’s a beautiful day in Sintra but Jimmy is unaware
of his magnificent surroundings

EXT FONTE DOS NOIVADOSSINTRA - DAY 3

As Jimmy turns the corner something makes him slow down
It’s nothing more than an old fountain adorned with beautiful
tile work He stops to listen to the sound of the working
fountain and as if hit by a wave of nostalgia he slowly
approaches the water stream And as Jimmy touches the water
his eyes fill up with tears

TIAGO (0OS)
We call that Fonte dos Noivados -
The Engagement Fountain
EXT OVERLOOKSINTRA - DAY 4

Standing on top of a sloped street an elegant older man with
silver hair adjusts his BINOCULARS trying to get the scene
down below of Jimmy at the fountain into focus

The friendly looking Frenchman in his early 60’s is MICHEL
GAGNE Next to him is TIAGO MIRANTE a striking young
Portuguese guide

TIAGO (0S)
The tile work is from the late 18th
Century from the reign of Dona
Maria I At that time unmarried
girls would come from all over the
region to drink from this ancient
fountain They’d do this pilgrimage
because there was a belief that the
waters would help them find a good
husband

Michel lets his binoculars fall to his chest and hang from
their straps

MICHEL
And did it work

TIAGO
They say so

MICHEL
How magnificent If only it was so
easy

Tiago smiles benignly then starts down the street watched
by Michel

MICHEL
(to himself)
Magnifique
EXT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOSWIMMING POOL - DAY 5

Blue water The surface of transparent blue water trembles
projecting abstract forms

A woman’s hand touches the water a reflection of her face
still abstract fills the screen She seems to be looking at
herself or at the bottom of the pool

FRANCOISE “FRANKIE” CREMONT kneeling by the pool dips one
hand into the water then the other one making sure both
wrists are wet and cool As if part of a ritual she then
splashes water on the back of her neck Once twice

Frankie gets up and meditative keeping her eyes down at the
water takes a deep breath She’s a striking woman with a
very short haircut messy like a boy’s accentuating her
strong features

CUT TO

MAYA 15 light-skinned black in shorts and a tank top is
lying on a lounge chair by the pool reading Wuthering
Heights She looks up from her book inquisitive recognizing
something or someone she knows

CUT TO

Frankie drops the bathrobe She’s topless wearing only the
bottom part of a bikini Another deep breath and she dives
into the swimming pool

Maya puts her book down and watches as Frankie swims under
water and comes to the surface close to her

FRANKIE
Good morning

MAYA
(British accent)
There’s people in the hotel you
know

FRANKIE
I don’t see anyone

MAYA
They can take pictures

FRANKIE
That’s okay I’m very photogenic

Maya observes as Frankie swims away her semi-naked body
moving gracefully under the water

INT PORTUGUESE BAKERY - DAY 6

A traditional Portuguese bakery with glass shelves filled
with the freshest most delicious pastries It’s all so fresh
you can almost smell it Behind the counter is LUCIANA
serving Jimmy placing pastries in a takeaway box Jimmy is
sipping an expresso
JIMMY
So that’s four queijadas And now
let’s see six pastéis please
LUCIANA

You look tired today Did you not
get enough sleep

JIMMY

Another SALESWOMAN standing next to Luciana laughs at what
she’s just heard

SALESWOMAN

JIMMY

morning

The Saleswoman laughs some more Luciana blushes

LUCIANA

Luciana hands him his box of pastries

Jimmy takes another sip from his espresso trying to enjoy
the Portuguese morning
INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOIAN and SYLVIA’S SUITE - DAY 7

IAN ANDOH 46 an Englishman black solidly built sits on
the bed wearing shorts holding a running shoe He tries to
put the shoe on but it’s too tight He picks it up again
and as he loosens up the shoe laces working meticulously
from the top part down a recurring thought manifests itself

IAN
The whole thing is so unfair I
can’t get over it They’re one of
the happiest most perfectly
romantic pairs I have ever known

Ian’s wife SYLVIA ANDOH late 30’s stands across the hotel
suite dressed in pants and a bra picking up a shirt from an
open suitcase They must have been a happy couple at some
point Now approaching middle age something sets them
apart

SYLVIA
There’s no perfection there They
have their grievances

Ian puts on the running shoe

SYLVIA
Have you seen my yellow cashmere
sweater

IAN

To think that one is suddenly taken
away from the other by this
thing this horrible thing makes
me lose faith in love itself

SYLVIA
So romantic all of a sudden

IAN
Don’t be cynical We’re seeing your
father go from romantic bliss to
tears and despair

Ian stands up and grabs a T-shirt but before he puts it on
he looks at himself in the mirror and grabs his own love
handles

IAN
I have to stop with the bread

SYLVIA
Why
IAN
I’ve gained weight

SYLVIA
Don’t start Please

Ian puts the T-shirt on Sylvia closes down the suitcase
frustrated that she can’t find what she was looking for

SYLVIA
What day is it today Thursday

IAN
Wednesday

She goes in the drawer grabs the first shirt she sees and
puts it on

SYLVIA
It’s impossible to pretend we are
enjoying this trip It’s a brutal
idea she had For us all to come
here at a time like this

IAN
You sure it wasn’t your father’s
idea

SYLVIA

What do you think

Sylvia goes out the door leaving Ian alone with his weight
and his shoes

EXT PORTUGUESE BAKERY - DAY

Jimmy is walking out with his box of pastries when he runs
into Michel and Tiago

MICHEL
You beat us this morning

JIMMY
“Td woken early and I took a long
time getting ready to exist”

Michel isn’t sure he understands

MICHEL
I’m sorry
JIMMY
Fernando Pessoa I just can’t help
it My mind swims with him whenever
I’m here

MICHEL
Jimmy you are the only actor I
know who reads anything but their
reviews

Jimmy laughs and then offers his box of pastries

JIMMY

Queijadas anyone Or a pastel
MICHEL

How is she this morning
JIMMY

She’s good thanks Fine
MICHEL

And you
JIMMY

I’m here in this magical town with
the people I love most I have no
right to complain do I

MICHEL

right to complain don’t you
Tiago

TIAGO

The three men smile at each other awkwardly

INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOFRANKIE and JIMMY’S SUITE - DAY 9

Frankie already dressed her hair still wet goes to the
dresser and picks up a cardigan sweater

FRANKIE
Will this one do

As Frankie hands Sylvia the sweater Sylvia notices a
bracelet Frankie has on her wrist and grabs her hand to take
a better look

SYLVIA
Wait a minute
FRANKIE
Isn’t it gorgeous

SYLVIA
Is it real

FRANKIE
Pink diamonds Colombian emeralds
It’s Bulgari vintage

SYLVIA
How come I’ve never seen this one
before

FRANKIE
It was given to me by a man I knew
between Michel and your father
There were quite a few you know I
was younger than you are now And
very beautiful I never wear it
Not because of your father - he
doesn’t care But it’s a bit
flashy no

SYLVIA
It’s Bulgari

FRANKIE
I’m always afraid it’1ll get stolen
or something but now I’m like
‘what the hell’

SYLVIA
Can I try

SYLVIA
He must’ve really loved you this
man

FRANKIE
Love I don’t know He liked me
and he was rich I try never to
confuse money with love He said
the colors were perfect for me
Whatever that means

Frankie places the bracelet onto Sylvia’s wrist Theres a
knock on the door but the girls are too excited to hear
anything else but themselves Sylvia admires the stones
against the light

The door opens and Paul comes in He’s straight out of bed
hasn’t even washed his face yet

Paul gives his mother a double kiss on her cheeks and goes to
sit on the bed without a word

PAUL
My room has a terrible leak

SYLVIA
Well good morning

PAUL
I can’t sleep

SYLVIA
Try another room

PAUL
I asked Nothing available

SYLVIA
Is the water dripping on you

PAUL
No it’s in the corner But still
it’s all night “drip drip
drip” It’s impossible

SYLVIA
You’re too sensitive

PAUL
You want to switch rooms

SYLVIA
You want to sleep with my husband

PAUL
Question is do you want to sleep
with your husband

SYLVIA
None of your business
PAUL
You started this
FRANKIE
Children I haven’t even had coffee

A beat Paul keeps staring at Sylvia defiant but this is a
sensitive matter Sylvia would rather not discuss All very
clear to Frankie

SYLVIA
I’m going to get some sun You
should try it sometime Paul Would
be good for your skin

Sylvia walks towards the door

FRANKIE
Vivi
Sylvia turns around takes the bracelet off

SYLVIA
I forgot Sorry

PAUL
Don’t forget sun screen especially
there on the side

Sylvia gives him an annoyed look
PAUL (CONTD)
Sun can be so unforgiving to your
wrinkles
Frankie puts the bracelet back on as Sylvia exits
Frankie is now alone with her son Paul She goes to the
bathroom mirror and starts putting some makeup on Paul

follows her

The conversation that follows as will all between French
mother and son is in FRENCH

PAUL PAUL
Je me sens hyper malhereux Im so terribly unhappy
FRANKIE FRANKIE

PAUL PAUL

PAUL PAUL
Bravo Splendid
EXT PALACIO NATIONALSINTRA - DAY 10

ILENE BIANCHI a great looking woman early 50’s with
youthful charm and dark winsome eyes pulls a small carry-
on bag up a street behind the historic Palace of Sintra

GARY (0S)

My problem is the story If I could
just get that right you know I
think I could really make something
good Something great even

Ilene looks around as she walks her curious and peaceful
eyes enchanted by the views of Sintra

GARY (0S)

But I just can’t get my head around
a conventional three-act structure

and they want that

Shes followed by GARY TOMLINSON a shaggy sandy-haired
American mid 50’s also pulling a carry-on bag

GARY

Anyone who might finance it at
least The first act - man that’s
something you know And then the
second - isn’t that enough A third

just seems gratuitous

Gary is completely uninterested in the view but Ilene knows
him well and is able to shut him out in her head She lets
him talk as they keep walking up the street

GARY
I’m interested in all of it Story
is just one part I see geography
as destiny you know what I mean
I’m interested in what constitutes
intimacy identity community how
we communicate with ourselves
with our surroundings and how
these human constructs can be
rendered in image and performance

As they turn a corner the colorful Palacio da Pena on top
of the hill comes into view

GARY
Do you think it’s crazy to think
about shooting on 35 It would be
so amazing Ilene

The view of the multi-colored fantasy castle is a wonder and
Ilene pauses to take it in

GARY
Ilene Are you even listening to
me

ILENE

Wow They were right Looks like
something out of a fairy tale

She looks out at the busy beautiful town in front of her

EXT FLOWER STANDSINTRA - DAY 11

A small group of YOUNG GIRLS in Catholic school uniform walk
down the street They pass Paul who smiles and tries his
well-rehearsed Portuguese

PAUL
Bom dia

But the girls are not interested They don’t respond but
that doesn’t faze Paul He breathes the air of Sintra looks
around at his magnificent surroundings and it makes him feel
good

Just up the street there’s a little FLOWER STAND displaying
local plants and flowers in unexpected artful arrangements

As Paul passes by he notices the very pretty girl BIANCA
early 20s with pale white skin dark hair and piercing
green eyes behind the stand putting together a new
arrangement

Paul slows down He can’t believe his eyes so he turns
around and discreetly looks back at her There she is like
a vision putting together different plants making artful
arrangements

Paul decides to walk back

BIANCA
Bom dia

PAUL
Bom dia

Paul checks out the flowers while discreetly checking out
the girl He picks up an arrangement and smells it deeply

PAUL
Hmmm The smell

BIANCA
Lavanda is the best

PAUL
Reminds me of someone

BIANCA
Someone you love

PAUL
Someone I used to

BIANCA
She broke your heart

PAUL
She married somebody else

BIANCA
Ah I see

She keeps working on her arrangement while Paul chooses
another to smell

PAUL
Which one would you say is the most
sensual

BIANCA
Depends on who you’re buying it
for

PAUL

A very beautiful girl I think
she’d like what you like

She smiles and puts down her arrangement to go assist Paul
She chooses a big bouquet and hands it to him

BIANCA
What do you think of this one

They are interrupted by the arrival of a young man JOAO
MIGUEL bringing an armful of fresh plants and flowers He
senses something in the air as Bianca goes behind the
counter back to her arrangement Paul smelling the flowers
is caught off guard

JOAO MIGUEL

shrugs at his suggestion

PAUL

JOAO MIGUEL

BIANCA BIANCA

EXT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOCOURTYARD - DAY 12

Sylvia is outside the Quinta on a small dirt road to the
side talking on her cell phone

SYLVIA

(on her phone)
I know I saw your messages but I
specifically asked for two
bedrooms

(---)
Oh so I could turn that into a
second bedroom
Well but that would cost a
fortune Listen my daughter is
going to college in a few years I
don’t need two bathrooms And I
don’t mind if we have to go a bit
further West

(---)
Okay For comparison maybe It’s just too
far

(---)
Thank you talk to you soon

Sylvia hangs up and steps to the side to look at the view
She breathes it in and tries to make her troubles go away -
it is a gorgeous place but the tension on her face does not
dissipate Sintra’s gardens and fabulous private villas seem
a world away

MAYA (0OS)
Mom

Maya in shorts and a T-shirt carries a backpack ready for
a day out

MAYA (CONTD)
What are you doing

SYLVIA
(shows her cellphone)
I couldn’t get any reception

MAYA
‘Cause you look all sneaky there I

SYLVIA
What do you mean “not much”
MAYA

SYLVIA

Maya walks away towards another part of the garden where
she has left her books and papers on a large stone table She
begins to pack her things when Sylvia joins her

SYLVIA
Honey Maya Listen to me let’s
not argue

MAYA
What

SYLVIA
You know your father’s just fishing
around He’s looking for something
that isn’t there

MAYA
You’re insane

SYLVIA

MAYA
Why not You tell me lying is the
worst thing I could do ever and
then you ask me to lie for you

SYLVIA
Maya you’re not lying You’re just
holding information Your father
shouldn’t know anything before

I’1l tell him when the time is

right

MAYA
Don’t you think he knows when I’m
lying

(almost crying)
You always make me do this

SYLVIA
I’m not making you I’m sorry I’m
just struggling that’s all Come

unhappy

Sylvia tries to hug Maya but Maya is not up to it - she
pulls away

unhappy

SYLVIA
Stop calling me Sylvia I’m your

Maya walks away Fast She leaves the courtyard and heads up
the road outside the Quinta Sylvia catches up with her and
calls out

SYLVIA
Maya Where are you going

MAYA
(calling out to Sylvia
behind her)

(MORE )

MAYA (CONTD)
It’s not independence day if I tell
you

Maya continues and Sylvia puts her foot down

SYLVIA
Stop Look at me

Maya follows orders stops and turns to look at Sylvia

SYLVIA (CONTD)
Don’t go very far You know we’re
all meeting at Peninha in the
afternoon

MAYA
What’s that

SYLVIA
It’s a place at the top of the
mountain that Frankie’s determined
for all of us to see

MAYA
I can’t promise

Maya turns and continues on

SYLVIA
Maya It’s for Frankie

Maya kicks a little rock on the dirt road

MAYA
Fuck Frankie She’s not even my
grandmother

Sylvia can’t hear her She’s already far away

EXT FONTE DOS NOIVADOSSINTRA - DAY 13

Ilene is by the “Engagement Fountain” She reaches out
cupping her hand and thirsty drinks a few sips of the
water

Paul carrying his bouquet of flowers passes by as Ilene is
drinking the water They don’t see each other

Ilene sits on the little bench that surrounds the Fountain
with her bag and Gary’s next to her She refreshes herself
splashing some cold fresh water on her neck on her face She
sits reading a Frommers Portugal guide waiting

Ilene raises her eyes from her book distracted and
recognizes someone on the street

Jimmy comes down on the other side of the street carrying
his little box of pastries

ILENE (0S)
Jimmy

He sees Ilene waving but he doesn’t think it’s for him

Ilene stands up and smiles Jimmy can’t dismiss her It’s
for him and he comes her way

JIMMY
Can I help you

ILENE
Yes I’m lost

JIMMY
I’m not a local but - What are you
looking for

ILENE
Jimmy It’s me Ilene

Jimmy looks at Ilene with some recollection but still
uncertain of her identity

ILENE
I worked with Frankie in New York
On Noah Baumbach’s movie

JIMMY
Ilene

ILENE
I was her hairstylist

JIMMY
Of course I’m so sorry What a
small world to run into you here
How wonderful

He gives her a big hug

ILENE
Didn’t Frankie mention

JIMMY
Frankie talks about you all the
time

ILENE
That’s sweet You know she’s the
only actress in all my years of
working in film that I’ve become
real friends with But with the
distance it can be hard to keep

up

JIMMY

Just the other day I was trying to
remember the name of that
restaurant you took us to last time
we were in New York I wanted to
recommend it to a friend

ILENE
Which one

JIMMY
It was a classic American steak
house Very good

ILENE
Keen’s On 36th Street

JIMMY
Yes that was it Amazing

ILENE
You liked that mutton chop huh

JIMMY
I loved that mutton chop But was
that the last time we saw you I
thought maybe in London also

ILENE
No I haven’t been to London yet
but I’m hoping to It’s been a long
time

JIMMY
And now “lo Cintra’s glorious
Eden intervenes”

ILENE
I just read that How funny

She motions with her guide book
JIMMY
“Lo Cintras glorious Eden
intervenes
In variegated maze of mount and
glen
Ah me what hand can pencil guide
or pen
To follow half on which the eye
dilates
Through views more dazzling unto
mortal ken
Than those whereof such things the
bard relates
Who to the awe-struck world
unlocked Elysiums gates”

ILENE
I don’t know much about Byron I’m
embarrassed to say but it’s
beautiful

JIMMY
Oh I wouldn’t know anything about
him except I had to memorize that
poem for my Leaving Certificate He
seems to have been everywhere
though Every town in Europe seems
to claim him And he had scandalous
affairs in each stop In Greece
they consider him a national hero
As boys we thought his stuff was
very sexy to read believe it or
not Really romantic

ILENE
Sounds like a full life

JIMMY
Well he did die very young

ILENE
Didn’t they all But wouldn’t you
rather live a life full of passion
and adventure even if it’s short
than go through an endless
monotonous string of the day after
day after day

JIMMY
Oh I don’t know It’s easy to say
life is wonderful when you go from
one adventure to another but Byron
suffered quite a lot Anyway
that’s not reality for most people
(MORE )

JIMMY (CONTD)
Certainly not for me I think that
to try and find beauty in everyday
life when you might think that
things are dragging on that is
kind of better The most difficult
but the most rewarding maybe

Jimmy pauses Ilene looks into his eyes taking in his point
of view reflecting Then she smiles

JIMMY
What are you doing here

ILENE
You don’t know

JIMMY
No I-

Gary approaches as Jimmy and Ilene continue their
conversation

new Star Wars movie We have a well
deserved break

JIMMY

ILENE
It’s actually a good job

JIMMY
I’m sure I didn’t mean I’m sorry

ILENE
No don’t worry Of course But
they pay well And for the most
part the people are nice It’s a
great crew And Spain is so
wonderful

JIMMY
Does that mean Chewbacca is going
to have a new hairdo

Ilene laughs Gary steps in
ILENE

Well I tried a Farrah Fawcett on
him but in the end-

GARY
Shush Sorry

Gary is instantly in the middle of the conversation He winks
at Jimmy

GARY
We signed a confidentiality
agreement

JIMMY
Ok

Jimmy isn’t sure if that’s supposed to be funny but he
understands that this is Ilene’s friend so they shake hands

GARY
It’s ridiculous but it’s Star
Wars They are very serious about
it

JIMMY
Uh hum

On the other side of the street Michel observes the scene
quietly with Tiago next to him smoking a cigarette

GARY

right next to it but apparently--

Michel steps in

MICHEL

Jimmy seems to suddenly realize that he’s holding a box of
pastries and offers one to Ilene

JIMMY
Would you like a pastry

Ilene takes a queijada from the box

JIMMY

EXT PENA PARKPONTE PERGOLA - DAY 14

An exquisite park with old stone gates small lakes and
views

Sylvia carries the flower bouquet Paul bought while he walks
next to her

SYLVIA
Are you excited about New York

PAUL
I’m looking forward to it But
excited I can’t be excited about
anything at the moment

SYLVIA

Did you get the sublet
PAUL

I’m not sure
SYLVIA

How come
PAUL

I haven’t sent the documents yet
SYLVIA

Why not
PAUL

Since I got the news I haven’t
been able to concentrate I can’t
work I can’t think about anything
else

SYLVIA
When you get bad news you should
focus on the practical stuff

PAUL
It’s too overwhelming

SYLVIA
There’s nothing better to remedy an
overwhelming situation than having
to fill out paperwork Did you call
the number I gave you the tax

lawyer

PAUL
Yes I called him What an arrogant
guy

(MORE)

PAUL (CONTD)
He says I should try to convince my
mother to incorporate with me and
Jimmy

SYI

Ill talk to

LVIA
my dad You should

talk to Frankie

PA

UL

This is the last subject I want to
bring up with her

SYLVIA
Then youll have to pay the
ridiculous inheritance tax

PA
You’re so

SYI

Pragmatic

PA

UL

LVIA

UL

That’s one word for it

SYLVIA
It’s just life Paul I don’t make
as much money as you do And when
you have a teenage daughter you
get practical

PAUL

Maybe
Sylvia takes a long pause and then braves it

SYLVIA

I’m going to

PA

leave Ian

UL

How many times have I heard this

SYI

This time is
it anymore

PA

LVIA

for real I can’t do

UL

Is that why you’re calculating your

inheritance

SYI

Stop it You

LVIA
can’t say that to me

PAUL
It’s just that I’ve been hearing
you say this for so long The
timing is interesting

SYLVIA
You are so fucking self righteous

PAUL
Come to New York

SYLVIA
Why would I come to New York

PAUL
New life new city

SYLVIA
It’s not that easy

PAUL
No it’s not

They look at each other understanding

SYLVIA
This is all just so horrible I
can’t believe it really I just
can’t

Paul puts his arm around her and Sylvia welcomes the
gesture and returns the affection

That’s when Paul tries to kiss her It’s a surprise for
Sylvia and she pushes him away dropping the bouquet of
flowers to the ground

SYLVIA
You know that might have been
romantic when we were teenagers

PAUL
Even better now We have more life
experience

SYLVIA
Sometimes I really hate you

PAUL
I’m serious about you coming to New
York I need the pragmatism You
need to get away from Ian

SYLVIA
Oh you have no sense of your
privilege If I could get a job in
banking maybe I would But they’re
not hiring philosophy majors at
Credit Suisse these days

PAUL
You wouldn’t want a job at Credit
Suisse

SYLVIA
Oh wouldn’t I Don’t make too many
assumptions You want to help me
Do me a favor Talk to your mother
about the incorporating idea It’1ll
save everybody a lot of money
It’ll be good for Dad too And
yes if it helps my father he will
be able to help me I’m sorry to
even talk about these things but
it’s true

Paul looks at her dismayed

SYLVIA (CONTD)
Don’t judge me Paul Don’t judge
me I am doing the best I can So
don’t you dare sit there from your
smug and ugly unhappiness and look
down on me At least I’m trying to
change things

She walks away as Paul picks up the flowers

EXT PENA PARKGREENHOUSE - DAY

Frankie and Jimmy walk through another area of the gardens

queijada

FRANKIE
How does she look

JIMMY
She looks great Better How long

FRANKIE
Five years ago Maybe six
JIMMY
She was too skinny when we were in
New York

FRANKIE
Maybe

JIMMY
She just looks more mature

FRANKIE
Arréte Jimmy

JIMMY
What

FRANKIE
“Mature” is offensive To a woman
particularly

JIMMY
Oh I don’t know

FRANKIE
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if she and
Paul get along

JIMMY
What are you talking about

FRANKIE
Ilene and Paul New York can be a
very lonely city They would be
good for each other

JIMMY

FRANKIE
I think she would be just perfect
for him

JIMMY
Christ Frankie You’re playing
Cupid again

FRANKIE
Don’t “Christ Frankie” me You of
all people should understand I
don’t want Paul to end up alone

JIMMY
Don’t let the kids find out that
this was your idea They’d go mad
This was supposed to be a family
trip

FRANKIE
It still is Family with a “Plus
One” so what

JIMMY
You come up with these crazy
scenarios in your head You think
you can manipulate everything

FRANKIE
I’m usually right

Jimmy starts to laugh Frankie laughs with him thinking it’s
about her comment but soon he’s laughing harder She
realizes it’s something else

FRANKIE (CONTD)
What

JIMMY
Well

FRANKIE

friend who looks very much like her
boyfriend if you want to know my
opinion

FRANKIE
Mais non She wasn’t supposed to
bring anyone

Frankie is not happy

JIMMY
Quel surprise

Jimmy throws his arm around upset Frankie and gives her a
kiss he loves her machinations and everything

FRANKIE
We will see

JIMMY
Come let’s go I want to take you
to a place I’ve read about

She pulls away from him

FRANKIE
No I’m hiking to Peninha

JIMMY
There’s more than enough time

FRANKIE
The one thing I don’t have is time

JIMMY
Don’t get melodramatic on me Just

Jimmy takes her hand and they walk down the path together

EXT QUINTA DA BOICA - DAY 16

Ilene sips tea alone on the terrace of a small and
beautifully renovated house a private Quinta There’s a
swimming pool down below and a view to the immense green
valley

Gary comes out to join her he’s holding something behind his
back

GARY
I wasn’t expecting this The photos
on the site don’t do it justice
They should hire me to take new
pictures This place is incredible

ILENE
This is so nice Gary It must be
very expensive

GARY
It’s fine George Lucas been berry
berry good to me

ILENE
To both of us But who knows what
the next job will be

GARY
That’s why I want to make this
movie I can’t be a cameraman
forever I need to change gears
before it’s too late

ILENE
I hope so

Gary pulls his hand from behind holding a small gift box

GARY
Here I have something for you

Ilene’s surprised He gives her the box

ILENE
Oh God

He gives her a kiss It’s a bit clumsy

GARY
I hope you like it

Ilene tries to smile She wasn’t expecting this

GARY (CONTD)
Open it

She does Inside the box a silver ring with a small detail
in gold It’s a designer ring very modern young

ILENE
Gary you shouldn’t have done this

GARY
Why You said you liked it

ILENE
I know I did but still
GARY
I walked by the store before we
left Valencia and it was still in
the window

Ilene closes the box with the ring inside

GARY (CONTD)
You know what I’ve been thinking

ILENE
No What were you thinking

GARY
I’ve been thinking I want us to
spend more time together

ILENE
Oh really

GARY
Yes I had an idea of getting rid
of my apartment in the city and
just moving into the house in Water
Mill full time Making a real home
out there

Gary tries to look directly into Ilene’s eyes

GARY (CONTD)
You could come and stay for as long
as you wanted And whenever one of
us is working in the city we could
stay at your place

ILENE
That’s a lot of plans all of a
sudden

GARY

We’d have a beautiful house on the
beach and Id help with the rent
on a nice apartment on the Upper
West Side We’d have two homes We
don’t need more than that What do
you say

ILENE
Oh I don’t know For me Water Mill
is more like a weekend place I
like it but for the beach and to
get away

GARY
A lot of people live there full
time and still work in the city
It’s really not very far And
besides with more time in Water
Mill you could paint more or
write or do any of those things
you always say you’d like more time
for Without my apartment we’d
both save money You wouldn’t need
to work so much

Ilene looks out onto the vast view of the valley in front of
them

GARY (CONTD)
Ilene Id like to be with you For
us to be together

ILENE
Is this a proposal

GARY
I didn’t think of it that way but
I guess it is What do you say

ILENE
I say let’s go out We just got
here The ring is beautiful Gary
Thank you I love it Thank you
Now come on get your coat get
your camera Let’s go Let’s see
where we are before we plan the
future

moment then goes inside after her

The tram is in motion and Maya is sitting inside writing in

a small notebook She finishes a sentence and looks out
seeing the small town pass by

when she’s interrupted by a couple of Portuguese boys PEDRO
and BENTO a bit older around 16 years old who are sitting
behind her Pedro leans in

PEDRO
O que voce esta escrevendo

EXT SANTA EUFEMIA - DAY 19

CARLINHOS a 5 or 6 year old boy comes from the woods near
the church playing with a small shovel picking up fallen
leaves

TIAGO (0S)

Many many years ago at a time
when the Barbarians dominated
Portugal there lived in Sintra a
princess named Eufemia who fell in
love with a nice country boy

Carlinhos runs up the road to an open area where the quaint
Church of Santa Eufemia is built

TIAGO (0S) (CONT’D)
Her father the King was a very
tough conservative man and
wouldn’t allow the relationship
with a commoner so they had to
stop seeing each other once and for
all

Carlinhos looks at the simple church white with a couple of
small green windows the image of a female saint on tiles to
the side and a cross at the very top It’s strikingly
beautiful in its simplicity

CARLINHOS’S MOTHER (0S)
Carlinhos Volta

Carlinhos runs back towards his mother We get closer to the
church where Michel is standing outside next to Tiago

The back part of the church is all constructed in stone very
old with a garden and another small building in the same
style

TIAGO
One day the princess ran into the
boy’s mother who told her that the
boy had been struck with a very
painful debilitating skin disease
The princess -

MICHEL
(interrupting)
Ah Voila

Michel waves

Jimmy and Frankie are walking up a dirt road towards the
church

FRANKIE
Bonjour

JOANA and JOAO two Sintra locals carrying a picnic basket
and bottles of wine walk arm in arm a few steps ahead of
them Joana looks back discreetly towards Frankie and
whispers something to her husband

Michel greets Frankie two kisses

MICHEL MICHEL
Viens chérie Tiago est en Come cherie Tiago is

lhistoire de Sainte- Saint
Euphémie
FRANKIE

TIAGO
Bonjour Senhora I was telling
them that during the time of the
Barbarians--

MICHEL

MICHEL MICHEL
(a Frankie) (to Frankie)
La jolie princesse s’était The good princess fell in
éprise d’un gargon du peuple love with a commoner and her
mais le Roi son pére lui father forbid their affair
interdit de le revoir Le The boy got sick

jeune homme tomba alors
gravement malade

MICHEL
(to Tiago)
Just keep going

TIAGO
The disease spread all over - the
boys body his whole skin was
full of horrible bloody sores The
princess went to see the boy
against her father’s orders and
brought him here where they used
to come to see the view She washed
him in the waters from the fountain
and-

FRANKIE
His skin went back to normal
immediately

TIAGO
No Not immediately He felt better
slowly It took him days Arms
first then the legs the face and
then-- the whole body It was a
miracle

FRANKIE
And people still come here to wash
themselves in this miraculous
water

TIAGO
They do because the water is said
to cure people of all maladies

Frankie knows what is going on in their minds

MICHEL
Where’s the fountain

Tiago points to a sign to the side

Impatient Frankie starts to walk the other way down towards
the woods
MICHEL

Frankie S’il te plait

JIMMY
Frankie

A thought disturbs Frankie she stops midway and turns back

to respond to Jimmy and Michel

FRANKIE

The two of you together it’s the

worst combination

MICHEL

JIMMY
(to Michel)

I can’t take it

Michel puts his hands in prayer imploring

Frankie turns around and goes into the woods leaving the
three men alone in the churchyard

EXT TAPADA DA ROMA - DAY 20

Frankie walks through the woods The sunlight draws geometric
patterns on the ground while playing a sometimes bright but
mostly dark game on Frankie’s face What could be jarring has
a calming effect on her She pauses to enjoy the sunlight on
her face for a moment and then keeps going

A BIG FAMILY OF LOCALS is having a picnic in an open area
surrounded by a fertile garden and connected to a modest
Quinta that sits on the edge of the woods There is a picnic
table set up under a leafy grape arbor and a fire burning in
a portable barbecue pit in the center It’s a happy event
with KIDS running around while ADULTS sit around the table
eating a big family meal Among them the couple from the
previous scene Joana’s face brightens up and she sees
something and pokes ANTONIA her aunt next to her

JOANA JOANA
Nao te disse I told you

The woman recognizes Frankie immediately

ANTONIA
Irma Aline Sister Aline

JOANA
Frangoise Cremont

Frankie nods and smiles acknowledging their presence and
tries to keep going but now the whole family is looking at
her Antonia pours some wine in a glass

ANTONIA
Madame Cremont

She offers the glass to Frankie

FRANKIE
Oh Thank you

ANTONIA

FRANKIE
(jokingly)

TIAGO

TIAGO
To be honest it is It’s very
hard My wife she’s like my
police

(MORE )

TIAGO (CONTD)
I love her but she doesn’t even
like me sitting next to another
woman You can imagine what it’s
like when I’m here in Sintra

JIMMY
Hmm

TIAGO
That’s why I look so tired today I
went out to dinner with a friend
last night another guide and when
I called my wife later to say
“goodnight I love you” she
already knew where I’d been what I
drank and who else was at the
restaurant It was incredible We
stayed up for hours on the phone
which is not good for my business
I have to be alert and the days
are not short you know

Tiago takes a long drag

TIAGO (CONTD)
Sometimes I don’t even know why I
stay married

Jimmy just looks at Tiago He doesn’t know how to respond

TIAGO (CONTD)
I’m sorry Senor It’s not to
bother you I am good I am fine
Shall we move on I will go see
about your friend now make sure we
didn’t lose him This is not really
a place for tourists and it’s
quite difficult to find the spot of
the “miraculous waters”

ride it As the surf breaks Pedro picks up speed with his
board conquering the wave and gracefully riding it all the
way to the sand

Maya sits on a towel on the white sand scribbling in her
notebook

She raises her eyes and sees Pedro his face hair and body
dripping sea water He tucks the boogie board into the sand
in front of Maya

because there’s nothing to tell
And why would you ask her anyway
Why would you involve her It’s not
some Machiavellian scheme I’m just

looking
IAN
That means you’re thinking
SYLVIA
You can’t be that surprised
IAN
I’m not surprised but it makes me
sad What we’re going through I

think it’s normal

SYLVIA
I don’t want normal

IAN
Where’s Maya anyway

SYLVIA
I’m sure she went to the beach She
wanted us all to go yesterday

IAN
The beach

SYLVIA
Probably

IAN
Alone

SYLVIA
I guess

IAN

Why did you let her

SYLVIA
She didn’t ask me

IAN
I hope it’s safe

SYLVIA
I told her not to go very far
IAN
She has a mind of her own our
girl
SYLVIA

Oh yes she does
Ian puts his arm around Sylvia

IAN
Like her mother

They walk up the road in each other’s arm a romantic couple
on vacation for a moment

EXT JARDIM DA VIGIA - DAY 26

Ilene walks fast ahead of Gary who struggles a little
trying to catch up

GARY
Youre walking so fast We’re not
in New York City you know You’d
think you’re trying to get away
from me

ILENE
I’m just a little thrown that’s
all

GARY
Ilene please slow down

Gary stops giving Ilene little option but to do so as well

GARY (CONTD)
Listen to me I’ve spent the last
ten years of my life going wherever
work took me I used to get so
excited about going to a new place -
Iceland Patagonia Vancouver -
but now I’m tired Not tired but I
have a strange feeling Emptiness
I’m home the sun goes down and
I think I just feel lonely Do you
ever feel that way

ILENE
No Not really I like being by
myself I always have even when I
was a kid I get home after two
months away and I’m happy to be by
myself I have my books my
magazines my kitchen my bed my
friends when I want them I feel
content

GARY

I guess I don’t I’m not content I
want change I don’t want to just
continue like it’s all going to
last forever I want to start
something new With you New for
both of us We have to admit we are
in the middle Ilene or past the
middle It’s not really the time to
coast is it

ILENE
Gary you just need to make your
own movie

Ilene proceeds starts to walk again

GARY
No that’s not what I need Maybe I
will maybe I wont

They approach the end of this green lush walkway and
suddenly they’re in the middle of a road where cars and loud
Tuk Tuk’s ride by

GARY (CONTD)
But I’m ready to settle down
Ilene I love you I love being
with you You know I don’t care
about marriage that’s not
important to me But being with you
is It is important to me And
Water Mill could be the answer
There’s a lot of space there I
could turn the garage into a new
studio for me and then you could
have the second bedroom inside all
for yourself I would knock before
entering I promise What do you
say

A MEGA TOURIST BUS invades the screen and stops right ahead
of Gary and Ilene It’s door open with a mechanized loud
oomph

Ilene’s attention veers towards the CROWD of TOURISTS who
descend upon the road happy and excited

A moment later she finds herself in the middle of the crowd
which seems to have multiplied itself

Ilene lets herself be taken away by the movement of the
crowd

Gary looks out but soon he can’t see her anymore

GARY
Ilene Ilene Ilene

EXT PENA PARKCHAPEL MANUELINA - DAY 27

Michel and Jimmy walk through a sunny area in the park in
the middle of a conversation

MICHEL
--just as the sun rises every
morning and the night comes at the
end of the day I was certain
Frankie and I were going to be
together forever So when one day
she told me she was leaving I
wondered how is it possible When
we got married I believed in those
vows ‘Til death do us part and
all of that

JIMMY
You always were a good Catholic
MICHEL
You know until today I hadn’t
been inside a church in a long
time But yes I was raised ina
very Catholic family

They continue walking

MICHEL (CONTD)
Frankie and I were so young And I
was scared I didn’t know if
anything was going to work out The
restaurant Frankie My
relationship to my own family It’s
hard to remember now - we remember
mostly the fun the exciting parts -
but it was scary to be young no

JIMMY
Oh yes

MICHEL
You never met my father did you

JIMMY
I don’t think so

MICHEL
He was tough He was in the
Resistance you know a real hero
And a real Catholic Marriage for
me was a life saver

JIMMY
That’s not very sexy is it
A woman wants to feel desired not
needed for survival

MICHEL
Not just women We do too But at
that time I didn’t know that I
couldn’t imagine my life without
Frankie And yet today I know that
her leaving was the best thing that
ever happened to me I met Thierry
I finally allowed myself to fall in
love with a man

JIMMY
That must have felt good

MICHEL
Times were different you know The
way I was brought up and
everything It wasn’t easy for me
but Thierry was very persistent

JIMMY
I remember the day you called to
tell Frankie

MICHEL
Frankie acted so shocked I almost
gave her an Oscar

JIMMY
That was not a performance I was
there

MICHEL
But please She should’ve known

JIMMY
She didn’t

MICHEL
Amazing how people sometimes choose
not to see what’s right in front of
them

JIMMY
She told me she never knew which
means that your performance must
have been very convincing You
should have got the Oscar

Michel laughs then continues

MICHEL
She was very worried about Paul
Thierry and I How it would affect
him

JIMMY
She’s still very worried about
Paul but not because of you She
can’t see him as anything but a
small child in need of constant
guidance and protection Kids have
to be left to find their own path
Certainly my daughter has Sylvia
never looked at me for any
direction even when she was a
little girl

They pause A quiet moment of reflection between them

JIMMY (CONTD)
I liked Thierry by the way I
really did What happened

MICHEL
I don’t know Maybe the restaurant
Late nights Other men Alcohol We
gave it our best

JIMMY
I know that

They approach a small chapel where Tiago is waiting for
them He steps forward and greets the two men with his proud
expertise

TIAGO
The Capela Manuelina was built by
Jeronimo monks in the sixteenth
century This used to be a sacred
space for meditation and reclusi--

MICHEL
(to Tiago)
Just a minute my dear
(to Jimmy)
Jimmy after Frankie

JIMMY
Please

MICHEL
things might change After If
there’s somebody and I hope there

will be-
JIMMY
Michel
MICHEL
Life takes turns you know Things
change
JIMMY

I don’t know what “after Frankie”
means There’s no “after Frankie”
for me

There’s some tension and Tiago feels it might be better to
leave the two men alone

TIAGO
I’m going to talk to the guards
and see if we can get inside

MICHEL
Let’s go Jimmy

Jimmy doesn’t seem very interested
MICHEL (CONTD)

I’m told there’s some beautiful
Arabic tile inside

JIMMY
(to Michel)
No You go I’11l catch up with you
later
28 EXT PENA PARKCASA DO JARDINEIRO - DAY 28

Gary is walking alone when he recognizes someone in front
and picks up speed

GARY
Frankie

Frankie is walking alone right ahead She turns as Gary
approaches his right hand extended greeting her

GARY (CONTD)
Bonjour Frankie Frangoise I’m
Gary I’m here with Ilene We
arrived this morning

FRANKIE
Ah You’re the friend

GARY
She told you about me

FRANKIE
No she didn’t My husband did I
guess you met him earlier

They shake hands

GARY
Such a pleasure to meet you

Frankie and Gary walk along the road side by side making
small talk
GARY (CONTD)
I’m working with Ilene on Star
Wars Im the second unit DP

FRANKIE
That must be a lot of work

GARY
I’m tired and thankful for this
break

FRANKIE
First time in Sintra

GARY
First time in Portugal We have
been shooting for almost a month
now and when Ilene told me you
were here I said ‘let’s go’ I’ma
big fan you know

FRANKIE
I’m a fan of Ilene’s She’s been a
good friend

GARY
We met on another film we did
together The Void I was the
Principal DP on that We’ve been
hanging out you know

FRANKIE
I’m not sure what that means

GARY
I love Ilene

FRANKIE
Ah That’s something

GARY
Frankie Ilene says May I call you
Frankie

FRANKIE
That’s what my friends call me

GARY
You look even better in person you
know Do people tell you that

FRANKIE
You’re being kind

GARY
No it’s true You know I wanted
to talk with you about something
if we can find the right time I
have a film project that I want to
direct

FRANKIE
Your first time directing

GARY
Yes well no But my first
feature I’ve been thinking about
it for a long time And I’ve shot
over 18 films for other people I’m
ready to start you know And I
think you and I share a taste ina
certain kind of cinema It’s about
an opera singer who loses her
voice

FRANKIE
Ha That’s funny

GARY
I think youd be perfect for it

FRANKIE
I can’t sing

GARY
But that’s it She loses her voice
It’s almost like silent film
acting and I can’t think of anyone
more expressive for the role Like
Greta Garbo

FRANKIE
Or Fatty Arbuckle

Gary laughs uncomfortably

GARY
Can I can send you the script

FRANKIE
If you’d like When are you
thinking of shooting this

GARY
It’s not going to happen now I
need a year at least to prepare
(MORE )

GARY (CONTD)
If we’re going to collaborate I
think it’s better to be up front
with you it’s going to take time
to get it together You know the
business I’d say realistically it
will be a year a year and a half
before we start shooting

FRANKIE
I see

Frankie takes a deep breath They walk side by side
silence for a moment

GARY
You know Frankie I’m going to
take time off to work on this film
I have a house in Water Mill
that’s just under two hours from
New York it’s a beautiful place
I’ve invited Ilene to come live
with me Don’t you think it would
be a good idea for her to settle
down a little bit Not travel so
much Not work so much on projects
she doesn’t really care about

FRANKIE
Does it matter what I think

GARY
You know her well

FRANKIE
But does it matter If you’ve
invited her then you should know
Ilene is the kind of woman wholl
tell you straight to your face what
she thinks No bullshit Ilene And
no bullshitters She doesn’t have
time for people who aren’t very
real very sincere you know
That’s why I like her

Gary doesn’t know quite how to respond

FRANKIE (CONTD)
Now if you’ll excuse me I’m going
to go look for my son I haven’t
seen him since the morning and
this was meant to be a family
vacation

in

She walks away leaving Gary alone among the trees and the
silence

EXT PRAIA DAS MACAS CLIFF - DAY 29

The cliffs at the end of the beach Maya wearing only a long
T-shirt over her wet beach clothes hikesclimbs the tricky
part of a ledge She places one foot on a rock while one
hand tries to hold on to a higher mark on the ledge She
makes sure the one foot is firm on the rock while looking
for a safe step for the other foot She climbs up for a
second but not sure of her next step strides back down
That’s when a helping hand enters frame

Pedro extends his arm and pulls Maya up As she climbs she
steps with the wrong foot and falls into his arms clumsy
They smile a bit disconcerted

Maya and Pedro walk hand in hand on this rocky path high up
at the end of the beach They are away but not far from the
sand surrounded by the ocean They stop to look at the view
the long golden sand beach and on the other end a rocky
cliff crowned with small charming white houses typical
Portuguese

MAYA
Is that still Sintra

PEDRO
That’s Colares actually

MAYA
It’s so pretty

PEDRO
I knew you would like it If you
like I can buy you a postcard

Maya faces the view breathing in the moment Pedro comes
from behind and puts his arms around her She holds his
arms welcoming the gesture

PEDRO (CONT’D)
I used to come here with my parents
and my sister every summer My
whole life until I was thirteen

MAYA
And then what happened

PEDRO
My parents got divorced My
vacations were divided between time
with Mom then time with Dad and
there was no time left for this
Apple Beach anymore

A SEAGULL flies overhead and dives into the water A wave
crashes in the ocean down below

PEDRO (CONT’D)
But then I met Bento in Lisboa last
year We played football against
each other in a national
tournament His school won but we
became friends after and he
invited me to visit him in Sintra

Pedro turns Maya around They’re face to face and she gives
him a kiss Pedro smiles happily surprised and soon after
they kiss again this time a long slow one both discovering
the pleasure of each other’s mouths

PEDRO (CONT’D)
I have a confession The real story
of this Apple Beach has nothing to
do with Adam and Eve I’m sorry
Can I tell you

MAYA
It’s okay If you’d like

PEDRO
They say that the Ribeira River
over there used to carry down
apples from the farms in Colares
all the way to the coast and they
would end on the beach down here
But the thing is I’ve never seen
one single apple tree in Colares
so I don’t believe this story
There aren’t any apple farms in
Colares

For Maya he talks too much She kisses him again

After another long moment he pulls away and looks at her
with near wonder

PEDRO (CONT’D)
When can I see you again

MAYA
(laughing)

But I’m still here

PEDRO

I know but I miss you already

She smiles happy

Paul talked without thinking and his comment hits Frankie
the wrong way Her eyes tear up and she looks away trying
to hide them from her son But he knows

PAUL
Excuse-moi Maman Je suis
vraiment désolé

FRANKIE
Mais il n’y a pas de quoi

PAUL
C’est juste que je ne veux

Frankie takes her bracelet off Paul notices her admiring it

before she offers it to him

FRANKIE
Tiens Je voudrais te le

FRANKIE

this

She pushes the shiny bracelet into his hands
PAUL
Je n’en veux pas

He tries to give it back

FRANKIE
Il vaut au moins vingt mille
euros Si je te le donne

droits a payer plus tard
Mets-le a l’abri dans un coin
sir et comme ga d’ici

PAUL
Que tu approuves ou pas ga

difference

PAUL

FRANKIE

expensive you know

PAUL

you to believe but I make a
lot of money

FRANKIE
I know I dont approve

PAUL
I dont care if you approve

She forcefully hands him the bracelet
FRANKIE
Bon allez Prends-le

FRANKIE
Here Take it

Paul holds the bracelet finally but looks at it without

much care

FRANKIE
Il y a autre chose dont it
faut qu’on discute Cette
histoire de trust dont a
parlé Sylvia L’argent c’est
ton domaine De quoi il
s’agit

PAUL
Pour ga il faudrait qu’on
prenne rendez-vous avec un
avocat quelqu’un qui
maitrise vraiment le sujet
Ca ne se régle pas comme ga
et on n’est pas obligés de
parler de droits de
succession maintenant Si on
est en vacances c’est
justement pour oublier tout

ga

FRANKIE
C’est pourtant vité réglé
Tout ce que j’ai c’est
l’appartement de Paris Je
l’ai déja mis en vente et
j’ai l’intention de léguer ce
que je vais en tirer au
Conservatoire

PAUL
Ah bon Tu leur en fais don
Et Jimmy il le sait déja

FRANKIE
Mais oui Bien str Toi tu
n’as pas besoin de moi Tu me
l’as déja parfaitement fait
comprendre Jimmy s’est trés
bien débrouillé il a mis ce
qu’il lui faut de cdété
Sylvia peut compter sur Ian
Je suis stre qu’il a gagné
encore plus d’argent que toi

FRANKIE
Theres something else we
need to talk about This
incorporating idea of
Sylvias Money is your
business What is she talking
about

PAUL
I think we should just set up
a meeting with a lawyer
someone who really
understands the situation
These things are complicated
We dont need to talk
inheritance taxes while were
here Its a vacation from
all of that

FRANKIE
Not much to talk about All I
have is the apartment in
Paris Ive already put it on
the market I intend to
donate the proceeds to the
Conservatoire

PAUL
Really Youre giving it
away Does Jimmy know

FRANKIE
Yes Of course You dont
need me Youve made that
perfectly clear And Jimmys
saved plenty from his own
work Theres more than
enough there And Ian will
take care of Sylvia Im sure
hes made even more than you
PAUL
Sirement Je ne suis pas en
train de me plaindre Maman
Je n’ai aucune envie de vivre
a Paris Si tu veux faire don
de l’appartement vas-y
Simplement je suis
surpris Il vaut tant que ga
de toute fagon

FRANKIE
J’en demande trois millions
Tu connais le quartier

PAUL
A mon avis tu te trompes

FRANKIE

Ne me dis pas que je me
trompe Tu n’as pas 4 me
rabaisser comme ga Ca n’est
vraiment pas nécessaire Et
ensuite le Conservatoire
s’est engagé a créer une
bourse Frangoise Cremont pour
les apprentis comédiens

PAUL
Ah d’accord

FRANKIE
Je sais que c’est vaniteux de
ma part Mais c’est ga que je
veux et je prends mes
dispostions en conséquence
Jai besoin que tu t’assures
qu’ils le feront bien Tu
peux me promettre de t’en
occuper Paul

PAUL
Qu’ils feront bien quoi

FRANKIE
Qu’ils créeront bel et bien
cette bourse

PAUL
Non mais arréte 1a On
dirait que tu parles d’une
bande d’escrocs

PAUL
Im sure Im not
complaining Maman I dont
want to live in Paris anyway
Its fine for you to give the
apartment away Im just
Im surprised Is the
apartment really worth that
much money anyway

FRANKIE
Im asking three million You
know the neighborhood

PAUL
I think youre mistaken

FRANKIE
Dont tell me Im mistaken
Dont put me down like that
Its not necessary It’s not
And the school has promised
they would set up a Frangoise
Cremont Scholarship for young
actors

PAUL
Ah I see

FRANKIE
Its vanity I know But I
want it and Im planning for
it now I need you to make
sure they do it Can you
promise me that Paul

PAUL
They do what

FRANKIE
Set up the scholarship

PAUL
Oh please Theyre not
crooks
FRANKIE
Quant au reste il n’y a pas
grand-chose Je le donne au
fur et a mesure

FRANKIE
The rest theres not much
Im giving it away as I go

Paul looks at the bracelet again This time the light hits
it’s precious stones and it shines brighter it seems to
hold more value than just a few seconds before

FRANKIE
Tu as vu Ilene

PAUL
C’est qui Ilene

FRANKIE
Mon amie Ilene Elle est
arrivée

PAUL
Ilene Celle dont tu parles
tous le temps

FRANKIE
Oui Mon amie chef-coiffeuse
Elle a énormement de talent
Et puis elle est maligne
comme tout et elle me fait
rire Je suis stire qu’elle te
plairait

PAUL
Elle habite a New York

Frankie nods

PAUL
Et elle n’a pas de mec

FRANKIE
Ah ga je n’en sais rien
Mais elle est trés jolie
Elle est beaucoup plus jeune
que moi

PAUL
Et comme par hasard elle

débarque a Sintra en méme
temps que nous

FRANKIE
Have you seen Ilene yet

PAUL
Whos Ilene

FRANKIE
My friend Ilene Shes here

PAUL
Ilene The one you always
talk about

FRANKIE
Yes My hair stylist friend
Shes so talented Smart she
Makes me laugh I am sure
youd really like her

PAUL
She lives in New York

PAUL
And shes single

FRANKIE
Ah that-- I dont know But
shes very pretty She’s much
younger than me you know

PAUL
And she happens to be in
Sintra at the same time that
we are here
FRANKIE
Elle traville en Espagne
C’est juste a cété

PAUL
C’était censé 6étre des
vancances en famille

FRANKIE
Elle est sur le tournage du
nouveau Star Wars C’est
énorme Donc tu vois quand
je te dis qu’elle est
douée

FRANKIE
Shes working in Spain
around the corner

PAUL
This was supposed to be a
family vacation

FRANKIE
Shes on the new Star Wars
movie Its a major job
Shows you how good she is

All of a sudden the bracelet feels heavy on Paul’s hand
He’s clearly very upset and he tosses the bracelet up and

down

PAUL

C’est marrant La plupart des
méres trouvent que personne
n’est jamais assez bien pour
les fils

FRANKIE
Je ne sais pas de quelles
méres tu parles Pas la
mienne en tout cas Du moment
qu’il était un homme et pas
juif elle 6tait ravie Ca
lui était méme égal qu’il
soit homo

They pause angry

FRANKIE

Paul toute ta vie je t’ai
toujours donné tout ce que tu
as voulu et pourtant tu n’es
jamais content de rien Rien
ne te suffit jamais Aucune
femme Aucun homme Aucune
mére Aucun pére

PAUL
Funny For most mothers
there is never anyone good
enough for their sons

FRANKIE
I dont know what mothers you
are talking about Not my
mother As long as he was a
Man and he wasnt a Jew she
was perfectly happy She
didnt even care if he was a
homosexual

FRANKIE
Paul Ive given you
everything youve ever wanted
your whole life and yet you
are never satisfied with
anything Nothing is enough
for you No woman No man No
mother No father

In one quick gesture Paul throws the bracelet away far away

down the hill

FRANKIE
Paul Mais tu es malade

FRANKIE
Paul Are you crazy

Paul turns around and walks away from his mom furious
Frankie takes off goes running down the hill dropping the
bouquet of flowers behind her

EXT RUA RIGUEIRINHO - DAY 31

Paul is still fuming walking with firm fast steps when he
runs into Sylvia

PAUL
There you are

SYLVIA
Yes I’m late I’m meeting Ian for
lunch in town

PAUL
I just came from talking with
Frankie

SYLVIA
And

PAUL

The level of manipulation is beyond
anything I can fully explain And
by the way she’s selling the Paris
apartment so don’t get your hopes
up She’s getting all her ducks in
a row as the Americans say You
knew she would leave nothing to
chance

SYLVIA
What do you mean she’s selling the
apartment

PAUL
It’s already on the market and
she’s made up her mind She’s
leaving everything she’s got to the
Conservatoire which is not much
it turns out besides the
apartment

The news stops Sylvia cold in her tracks She leans on the
ancient moss covered rail wall that accompanies the road

SYLVIA
Seriously That’s absurd

PAUL
She worked her whole life She can
do whatever she wants with her
money And what she wants is to be
remembered She’s setting up the
Frangoise Cremont Scholarship Fund
for poor and needy actresses
That’s what she wants I’m sorry
her death won’t help you leave your
boring husband but I quite like
the idea

Sylvia picks up her pace walking fast away from Paul

PAUL
Sylvia Sylvia

EXT SEQUOIAS ROAD - DAY 32

Ilene walks by herself in the woods This is a more
primitive more chaotic part of the hills The trees are
taller their canopies denser and the light struggles to
reach the ground Ilene allows herself to get lost in the
colors the shades and light of nature

A sound brings Ilene’s attention back to the earth She looks
to the side behind a bush and sees a woman on all fours
sweeping fallen leaves around with her hands

It’s Frankie combing through the foliage looking for
something A shiny point a few feet away makes her frantic
for a second until she realizes it’s nothing but an ordinary
rock She looks up and sees Ilene

ILENE
What did you lose now Frankie
darling

Ilene extends her hand but Frankie isn’t ready to get up
yet

FRANKIE
If you stumble upon a Bulgari
bracelet it’s mine

ILENE
Seriously

FRANKIE
Emeralds rubies and diamonds

Ilene goes down on the ground and looks around her and so
does Frankie They can’t find anything

They’re both on all fours now face to face and they start
laughing

ILENE
You’re joking

FRANKIE
I’m not

ILENE

What happened

FRANKIE
My stupid son

ILENE
Paul

FRANKIE
It’s the only one I have Help me
up here I’ve looked everywhere
already

Ilene gets up and extends her hand Frankie holds it and as
she gets up she falls into Ilene’s arms

FRANKIE
Oh Ilene It’s so good to see you

ILENE
It’s good to see you

Frankie’s face looks more pale than normal Her eyes lose
sight her lips lose their color She feels suddenly dizzy

ILENE
Frankie

FRANKIE
I’m okay

Frankie tries to stay up but her legs get weak

FRANKIE (CONTD)
Help me

Ilene rushes to hold her friend but as she does Frankie
starts to fall down

ILENE
Frankie

Ilene still tries to hold her up but once she notices it’s
serious and Frankie is actually falling she lets her to the
ground carefully holding her head so it doesn’t hit
anything

ILENE (CONTD)
Oh my God Frankie

Frankie lies on the ground as her eyes roll back and the

muscles in her body jerk rhythmically for a second Ilene
stands back desperate unsure of what to do

EXT RESTAURANT - DAY 33

Ian and Sylvia sit at a restaurant in the city of Sintra
He’s served a salad by the WAITER while Sylvia picks on
bread and butter at the table

IAN
You’re not going to eat

SYLVIA
I’m not very hungry

Ian digs into his meal

SYLVIA (CONTD)
I’1l have a glass of wine Waiter

The Waiter comes back while Sylvia is looking at the menu

SYLVIA (CONTD)
(to the waiter)
A glass of Planalto por favor

The waiter takes the menu and leaves

Ian looks down at his plate and sticks his fork into a big
chunk of lettuce

IAN
Regardless of what I feel and of
what I think you feel we have a
home and an amazing daughter
and maybe it’s my personality I
don’t know I didn’t grow up like
you All of you I don’t have the
same expectations maybe I’d like
to think that our life together
our family is the most important
thing

Sylvia wasn’t expecting this She takes a sip of Ian’s white
wine

IAN (CONTD)
Of course I can fantasize once ina
while what my life would be like if
I had made different choices
That’s normal It’s human But
actually going through a divorce
It hasn’t crossed my mind

SYLVIA
Never

IAN
No

SYLVIA

Well I can’t say the same
They sit in a silence for a moment

IAN
So then you must know that there’s
only one ‘ground’ for divorce under
British law which is that the
marriage has irretrievably broken
down Five facts may constitute
this ground adultery unreasonable
behavior two years separation if
both parties consent five years
separation if only one party
consents and two years desertion

Ian pauses and eats a small bite of his meal

IAN (CONTD)
I’ve been faithful to you Sylvia
It would take a long very
expensive legal battle to try and
prove unreasonable behavior on my
part which I think would be your
only possible path

SYLVIA
I never thought about getting into
a battle with you

IAN
So I’m glad we’re having this
conversation because I wouldn’t
just let you go Sylvia You’d have
to take me to a court of law
that’s what it would take
SYLVIA
God you did more research than I
did

IAN

Of course I did I called a lawyer
What do you expect me to do He
made some calculations for me

SYLVIA
Calculations

IAN
I like to be prepared You must
have made calculations yourself
but this is what we came up with
In the unlikely event that you are
granted a decree Absolute since
you don’t have a salary your
alimony would get you according to
our calculations a one bedroom in
Upper Edmonton maybe a two bedone
bath in Lower Edmonton

The Waiter arrives with Sylvia’s glass of white wine
SYLVIA

That’s where Maya’s kick boxing
instructor lives

IAN
Is she the Bolivian
SYLVIA
Yes
IAN

Then maybe That would make sense
I hear Lower is very popular among
South American immigrants

Sylvia takes a sip of her wine and gets up

SYLVIA
I’m going to go

IAN
You don’t want to go with me to
pick up Maya

SYLVIA
No I want to go see the Regaleira

IAN
You want to go see the Regaleira I
see What is the Regaleira may I
ask

SYLVIA
It doesn’t matter

IAN
No that’s right You’re right
Sylvia It doesn’t matter
Sylvia turns around and heads out Ian disappointed picks
up her glass full of wine

EXT CAMINHO DA FONTE DOS AMORESBOICA ROAD - DAY 34

Ilene has her arm around Frankie as they walk out of the
woods

ILENE
Shouldn’t we call a doctor

FRANKIE
I’m fine Ilene

ILENE
You sure

FRANKIE
I was down on my knees for so long
when I got up I just felt faint for
a moment

ILENE
You didn’t just faint sweetie You
had a seizure

FRANKIE
Was it really

ILENE
Yes You scared me to death

FRANKIE
I’m so sorry

ILENE
No It’s just that I had no idea
what to do

Ilene lets go of Frankie but keeps an eye on her

They walk out of the woods and into the road

ILENE
You sure you’re okay now

FRANKIE
Yes I just feel a little cold
Don’t you

ILENE
Let me take you to your hotel

FRANKIE
It’s not far I think

It’s a narrow road and a SMALL GROUP of HIKERS come walking
from the opposite direction Ilene and Frankie get squeezed
on the side of the road

ILENE
Has this happened before

FRANKIE
I have one of these every other day
now

ILENE

But I thought you were fine

FRANKIE
I was After the treatment I had
two years completely cancer free I
went back to work and it was
great I made two films back to
back in England and in France

ILENE
You told me you were exhausted

FRANKIE
Yes but only because it was a long
shoot the one in Bath and we had
to be outdoors in the winter It
wasn’t easy but it was wonderful
And I felt fine

ILENE
And you did the series after

FRANKIE
Just one episode They brought me
back for one episode

(MORE )

FRANKIE (CONTD)
It was supposed to be quick and
easy but I suddenly started to
feel nauseous I knew there was
something going on so I was
reluctant to go see my doctor I
finished the work And then I went
to see him

Ilene blanches feeling bad news about to hit

FRANKIE (CONTD)
I don’t want to go into all the
details but the cancer has spread
it’s everywhere

ILENE
Oh Frankie
FRANKIE
They don’t think I’1ll see the New

Year

Ilene looks around her the nature and the skies looking for
something to say but she can’t say anything

FRANKIE (CONTD)
The difficult part for me is seeing
people cry so please don’t cry I
wanted you to come here because I
want you to meet my family I want
us to have a good time which for
me now means just time together

Ilene throws her arm around Frankie

ILENE
I’m going to miss you terribly

FRANKIE
I know you will

Ilene squeezes her even tighter

ILENE
Are you still cold

FRANKIE
I’m okay

ILENE
Do you have any idea where we are

Frankie looks around the road trying to find her way

ILENE (CONTD)
Oh no Why did I trust you
Frankie laughs They’ve been through this before

FRANKIE
I have no sense of direction

A Tuk Tuk passes by noisily with no passenger Frankie sees
it and immediately makes a gesture for it to stop

FRANKIE (CONTD)

Hey
EXT SEQUOIAS ROADTUK TUK - DAY 35

Frankie and Ilene ride on the back of the Tuk Tuk through the
roads of Sintra It goes fast and it’s not the most
comfortable vehicle but they laugh when they have to hold
on to each other as the Tuk Tuk goes into a sharp turn
Around them the lush mountains of Sintra its exotic
palaces its sublime tiled walls and its crumbling old
houses

Frankie and Ilene have to talk loudly to be heard

FRANKIE
I met your fiancé

ILENE
Fiancé Did he say that

FRANKIE
He says he wants to marry you

ILENE
Oh God

Frankie laughs

FRANKIE
And he wants me to be in his movie
He’s going to give me a script

ILENE
Damn Gary I’m sorry Frankie I
told him not to do that

FRANKIE
I told him I would read it but it
better be the starring role
ILENE
Of course it is He adores
Frangoise Cremont He really has
seen all your movies

FRANKIE
He has a lot of plans this Gary

ILENE
He’s a sweet guy actually We’ve
had a lot of fun together And I
think the script will be good He’s
deeper than he seems believe it or
not

FRANKIE
But you know he’s not the right one
for you Ilene You must

ILENE
But is there ‘the right one’ for
me

FRANKIE

Of course there is

ILENE
I don’t know I feel like I’ve been
looking my whole life

FRANKIE
“Trouve avant de chercher”

Ilene looks at her not following

FRANKIE (CONTD)
“Find it before you look for it”
It’s something Jimmy says One of
his famous quotes Paul Valery Or
Breton I think

The annoying noise of the mechanized three-wheeled taxi
accompanies the beautiful ride

FRANKIE (CONTD)
“Trouve avant de chercher”

ILENE
“Trouve avant de chercher”

EXT CAMINHO DA FONTE DOS AMORESBOICA ROAD - DAY 36

Gary walks down a remote long road alone oblivious to
everything around him

An OLD PORTUGUESE MAN walks by with his DOG and as they pass
by the dog barks at Gary bringing him back to the moment

OLD PORTUGUESE MAN
(to his dog)
Quieto Nao faga isso
(to Gary)
Desculpe

Gary smiles politely as the Old Man and the dog pass by
And now with the dog’s bark far away there is a strong
silence surrounding Gary He can hear the trees move and the

wind with piercing clarity He is alone with himself in this
beautiful place in Sintra

EXT QUINTA DA BOICA - DAY 37

Ilene comes out of the house onto the terrace She takes in
the view of the lush valley below a moment on her own to
reflect on the tough news of the day

GARY (0S)
Ilene

It’s Gary coming towards her from the front gate of the
Quinta

As he approaches her Ilene walks towards him and
unexpectedly she falls into his arms

GARY
Oh baby

Gary surprised by her emotions tightens his embrace

GARY (CONTD)
Oh honey sweet girl Don’t worry
It’s okay It’s okay

ILENE
It’s not

GARY
ShhhYou don’t need to say
anything

ILENE
When I came here I wasn’t
expecting so much

GARY
I know Me either This place is
really more to dream than to talk
about

She looks at him with compassion

GARY (CONTD)
I don’t know if it’s the mountain
air or these beautiful
surroundings I don’t know but I
realized today that love is all
that matters Not money Not jobs
or movies Or even companionship I
know it’s cliché but for the first
time I understand it’s only love
that matters

Ilene listens intently This is turning out differently than
she expected

GARY (CONTD)
I’m going to leave Ilene

ILENE
But we still have a couple days
off

GARY

I know we do but I’1l stay in
Lisbon for a night or two It’s
supposed to be a great town

ILENE
Gary I’m sorry-

GARY
There’s no need to apologize My
feelings for you if it’s not

reciprocal it’s silly to pretend
I’m too old for that Besides I
understand how much you value your
independence Stay here and enjoy
your friends That’s what you came
here for

ILENE
Gary when you shoot your film
I’11 come work on it

GARY
No I don’t think that’s a good
idea anymore I hope you
understand

ILENE
Oh Of course I do I understand

Gary turns to go
GARY
I should go pack I have a car

coming soon

He goes into the house leaving Ilene alone on the terrace

INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOFRANKIE and JIMMY’S SUITE - DAY 38

In her hotel room Frankie is sleeping Her pale white skin
barely covering the veins below she looks fragile
vulnerable and so different than she has throughout

Jimmy sits in a chair by the bed watching her closely
listening to every movement every breath

After a long moment he stands and starts to take off his
clothes He carefully hangs his pants on the back of a chair
then his shirt on a hanger

He goes to the bed and gets in beside Frankie Then he
turns and puts his arms around her

She feels his body close to hers and turns towards him

They start to make love quietly passionately

EXT TRAVESSA DE SANTA MARIA - DAY 39

PAUL

ILENE
Twenty three years Do you know
where in the city you’re going to
be living

PAUL
I don’t know

ILENE
I thought your mother told me you
had a found a place already
PAUL
My mother thinks she knows
everything She has all these
plans you know

ILENE
Of course She’s in a hurry

Paul seems a bit surprised at Ilene’s comment

PAUL
So you know

ILENE
Yes I’m so sorry If ever you need
anything-

PAUL
Well be fine by ourselves thank
you

Ilene is taken aback

PAUL (CONTD)
I’m sorry

ILENE
You know your mother invited me
here

PAUL

I know she did She wanted us to
meet She’s afraid I’m going to end
up alone in New York City

ILENE
Maybe she just wanted to see me
Frankie and I are good friends you
know

PAUL
Can I tell a story about Frankie

ILENE
I’m not sure I want to hear it
Paul It’s not necessary

PAUL
But I want you to hear it It will
help you understand our family a
little better You see Jimmy’s
always had a thing for Portugal
We’re all thankful to him for that
It’s a gift he gave us Portugal

(MORE )
PAUL (CONTD)
This is probably our fifth or sixth
time to come here together And
Sintra particularly you know they
came here on their honeymoon don’t
you That is their second
honeymoon They had each had others
before But when my mom first
started seeing him he took us on a
trip to the Algarve Have you been

ILENE
Never

PAUL
Praia da Falésia beautiful beach
south of here and twenty years
ago before the Portugal
renaissance or destruction
depending on who’s talking it was
almost deserted Really gorgeous
Mom Jimmy and Sylvia his
daughter Sylvia Have you met
Sylvia

ILENE
No I haven’t

PAUL
She’s lovely a little damaged but
lovely We all went to the Algarve
together Mom had moved to London
but only for a short time for a
film but clearly she and Jimmy
were also testing the waters for
the new family to be A family
vacation was decided and off we
went I barely spoke any English at
the time I was just your average
French schoolboy so as you can
imagine I was very nervous
Excited but nervous Particularly
because of Sylvia I had met her a
couple of times and really you
might not know it now but she was
the most beautiful girl ever She
was she is - a few years older
than me I was maybe fifteen and
she was eighteen or nineteen She
had a woman’s body already A
beautiful body When I saw her in a
bikini oh my God And I was such
a boy Anyway it was summer and
hot and she and I would spend the
whole day on the beach together

(MORE )

PAUL (CONTD)
Maybe I don’t need to go on You
get the picture right

Ilene doesn’t answer Paul continues

PAUL (CONTD)

One night Mom and Jimmy went out
to dinner and we said Sylvia and
I we were going to stay home and
watch TV They were showing the
movie Grease on TV You remember

(sings Summer Lovin’)
Tell me more tell me more did you
get very far

Ilene chuckles

PAUL (CONTD)
I don’t know what got into me
because I was actually a very shy
boy pimples and skinny and very
uncomfortable but I got up and I
started to imitate John Travolta
I grabbed Sylvia so we could dance
together and she screamed Not
because she didn’t want to No she
was sun burned And so naturally
I offered to put some lotion on her
shoulders She took her shirt off

A GIRL trotting on a HORSE comes their way following a
BLONDE TRAINER who holds the reins of her horse with white
gloves

PAUL (CONTD)
When my mom and Jimmy came back we
were having sex on the couch Me
and my soon-to-be step sister

The riders come fast and Paul and Ilene have to make space
for them to pass by on the road

PAUL (CONTD)
As you can imagine that was the
end of this new family idea I was
sent back to live with Michel in
Paris And my mother moved to
London To live with Jimmy and
Sylvia And that was that

Ilene takes it in
PAUL (CONTD)
You see in Portugal I lost my
mother once already It only seems
fitting that I’m here again now

He stops and looks at Ilene more closely

PAUL (CONTD)
She’s right about one thing you
are very attractive you know

ILENE
Is that a compliment

PAUL
Maybe My mother would like us to
get married

Ilene is silent

PAUL (CONTD)
Do you think you are the marrying
type

ILENE
Not to you

PAUL
I didn’t think so

An uncomfortable moment between them

ILENE
When are you moving

PAUL
I don’t know now Everything is a
bit up in the air as you can
imagine scheduling-wise

ILENE
If it was soon I would have been
happy to introduce you to a few
people in New York but I don’t
think I’1ll be there all that much
longer

PAUL
Oh no Pity

ILENE
Yes I got an offer to work on a
series in London in fact for the
BBC I need a break from New York -
Ive been there too long

PAUL
I see

ILENE
I was so looking forward to telling
your mother but now I can’t I
just can’t

PAUL
Yes I understand

They stand for a moment together Nothing more to be said
it seems

PAUL (CONTD)
I’m going to go now and catch up
with my father

ILENE
Ok I’m sure I will see you later

PAUL
Yes I’m sure we will

Paul walks off back in the direction of Michel and Tiago A
few feet away he turns and calls out to Ilene

PAUL (CONTD)
Ilene

She turns and stops

PAUL (CONTD)
Thank you for listening

She smiles this time warmly before they walk their separate
ways

EXT PRAIA DAS MACAS BEACH - DAY 40

It’s still bright on the beach but the sunlight is more
gentle casting long shadows as it approaches the horizon
Some seagulls fly above the surf only to dive in head on
hunting for fish On the sand only a few groups of families
or friends not as crowded as before

Maya and Pedro come walking along the surf side by side
They don’t hold hands but walk very close to each other in
silence watching the waves break Each is very aware of the
other’s body next to them as Maya’s arm swings it gently
rubs Pedro’s and she prolongs the moment feeling his skin
against hers extending a finger so it can hold his finger
for a brief moment playfully romantic

Pedro looks at Maya as they continue their stroll on the
sand too self conscious to hold hands but full of desire

EXT PRAIA DAS MACAS BEACH - DAY 41

A GROUP OF EIGHT BOYS and TWO GIRLS sit in a circle on the
sand with towels backpacks beer bottles and cigarettes
scattered all around All attention is on Bento Pedro’s
buddy from the tram who reads from a notebook

BENTO
“What is love if not blazing
flames I asked Grandpa will he
ever get over losing Frankie Will
he ever let go “You’re asking the
wrong question” he said “It’s not
about getting over or letting go”
He put his arm around me and I
wondered how this could possibly be
about anything else “It’s about
honoring what happened” he said
“You met a person that awoke
something in you A fire ignited”

There’s laughter all around Bento continues

BENTO (CONT’D)

“The work is to be grateful
Grateful everyday that someone
crossed your path and left a mark
on you” When Grandpa left I
looked at my reflection on the
water and wondered who will be
the one to ignite this fire inside
of me”

(comments )
Wow

More laughter louder Bento can’t see that behind him Maya
and Pedro are approaching He continues to read

BENTO (CONT’D)
“And when it happens I want to
hold him and kiss him our bodies
melting into each other our hearts
beating as one”

Maya can still hear the last words She recognizes her words
and jumps in to grab the diary from Bento’s hands

MAYA
What are you doing

Caught by surprise Bento tosses the book to another friend
and this friend to another

Maya runs around trying to grab it from them

PEDRO
(in Portuguese)
Stop it Guys

When one of the BOYS plays with Maya swinging the book
around her face like bait and then tossing it away to
another friend the unexpected happens Maya pushes the boy
hard and he falls to the sand

Maya dives ready to fight some more It’s a complete
surprise and the boys try to hold her back Some of them
laugh

Pedro gets into the mix and a fight amongst them ensues
There’s a scream and laughter punches and sand throwing all
around

The book falls on the sand and Maya immediately grabs it
She then grabs her backpack and walks away Pedro pushes one
of the boys who continues to laugh and they fight on the
sand Through an arm lock from the boy he sees Maya going
away

PEDRO (CONT’D)
Maya

INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOFRANKIE and JIMMY’S SUITE - DAY 42

Jimmy is lying on the bed his eyes closed In the distance
a piano plays softly Jimmy opens his eyes listening to the
music

INT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOLIBRARY - DAY 43

The grand library with an old piano in its center where
Frankie is playing music she knows so well

A CLEANING LADY from the hotel walks by carrying a bag full
of laundry Frankie smiles but the lady lowers her head shy
and discreet

Jimmy enters and stays by the door frame admiring the
scene as Frankie continues to play

Her hands glide through the different keys with the ease of
someone who’s trained but not a professional She makes a
slight mistake but keeps going as Jimmy comes to sit next
to her on the stool She moves a bit to give him space

JIMMY
Beautiful

Frankie looks into his eyes as she keeps playing and sees
that he’s actually crying under a forced smile

JIMMY (CONTD)
I’m sorry

FRANKIE
Don’t be It’s sad It’s very sad
indeed

JIMMY
Yes

The song comes to a natural end and Frankie reaches to close
the piano but Jimmy stops her

JIMMY (CONTD)
How about one more

FRANKIE
No I’m going to go for a walk if
you don’t mind I’1ll meet you all
at Peninha

Frankie gives Jimmy a small kiss on his head then gets up
from the stool and leaves

Jimmy alone with the piano the empty room and the silence
Until he strikes a key any key

EXT QUINTA DE SAO THIAGOFRONT GATE - DAY 44

Frankie comes out of the Quinta and heads up the long
sloping driveway towards the road

EXT PRAIA DAS MACAS TOWN - DAY 45

Maya runs through the streets of the small beach town

EXT CAMINHO DOS CASTANHAISSINTRA - DAY 46

Frankie goes up a path towards Sintra bordered by an old
stone wall with graffiti etched into the rock

As she goes up the steep incline ahead of her she pauses for
a second catching her breath but soon starts again with
determination

EXT TRAMWAY - DAY 47

Sitting on the tram Maya is lost in her own thoughts of the
beach and the day behind her

EXT SEQUOIAS ROAD - DAY 48

Leaving the woods behind Frankie walks onto the road where
earlier she had her argument with Paul

After she takes a few steps on the road she sees something
that makes her pause

In front of her the beaten up bouquet of flowers is still on
the ground oblivious to the people and the traffic that pass
by Frankie picks it up and smells the flowers The scent of
lavender instantly brings memories back to her

INT EXT TRAMTRAM STOP - DAY 49
The tram makes its way back into the city of Sintra

INSIDE THE TRAM Maya sits on the aisle looking at sights
MAYA’S POV FROM THE TRAM The little center of town has been
taken over by TOURISTS and BUSES its cafés and gift shops
filled with people from all over the world

Ian is coming around the corner towards the final Tram Stop

INSIDE THE TRAM Some people start to get up and gather their
things Maya recognizes someone on the street and waves

Ian waves but notices that Maya is waving at someone else

He looks in that direction and sees Sylvia coming his way
She waves to Maya

Ian and Sylvia husband and wife meet and wait together for
the tram to come to a stop

Maya steps off and onto the platform She embraces her
mother so tightly that Sylvia is a little thrown

EXT PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 50

Ilene walks beside a long wooden rail covered in moss of
various tones going up the hill creating a dirt path

As she enters the canyon Ilene runs into Jimmy surrounded
by magnificent rocks in this mostly desolate area The wind
is constantly blowing and a mist has started to form

ILENE
How did you find Frankie

JIMMY
Beyond recovered

ILENE
She’s a star

JIMMY
Yes I know It’s wonderful and
complicated

ILENE
I can imagine

JIMMY
You know people seldom say “no” to
Frankie

ILENE

I know She must have been very
disappointed with my visit

JIMMY
She wasn’t expecting you’d show up
with a boyfriend

ILENE
Ex-boyfriend

Jimmy looks at Ilene and raises his eyebrows Ilene laughs

ILENE (CONTD)
As soon as we got here he proposed
to me

JIMMY
And

ILENE
He’s going back to Lisbon tonight

JIMMY
Poor Gary

ILENE
Oh I don’t know Don’t get the
wrong idea about me or anything
I’m not some kind of femme fatale

JIMMY
You must do as you feel

ILENE
Did someone famous say that

Jimmy laughs

JIMMY (CONTD)
No just me

ILENE
I guess it’s true I have to be
true to myself But now I admit I
regret it a little It means I’11
have to start up again that phase
of drinks and meals and dates with
men I hardly know I’m starting to
think maybe I’m too old for it

JIMMY
Careful there If you’re old what
am I

ILENE

It’s completely different for you
men The older you are the more
attractive you get

JIMMY
Is that right
ILENE
Oh you must know I’m not going to
name names but you had a good fan
base in New York

JIMMY
Really
ILENE
Really
Ilene smiles
JIMMY

You know maybe you need a change
Take some time off Travel

ILENE
Maybe I’ve always loved New York
Really had a love affair with it
for the longest time But lately I
find every little thing about it
irritating The amount of people
the constant development the
noise the terrible subways

Now Jimmy laughs

ILENE (CONT’D)
It’s true All my favorite
restaurants are gone or going
soon

JIMMY
Not Keens

ILENE
But you can’t eat at Keen’s every
night

JIMMY
Why not

Ilene laughs again It feels good to talk honestly

ILENE
You know it’s funny If Gary had
proposed to me in New York maybe I
would’ve answered differently But
here I don’t know There’s
something about this place I
actually felt strong

(pause)
(MORE )

ILENE (CONTD)
You know Jimmy I hope to be in
London before the end of the year
There’s a job and it’s for several
months I hope I can be a support
for Frankie And for you

JIMMY
When will you be there

ILENE
Soon I’m waiting to hear
confirmation from the production

JIMMY
Please let me know I’d love to
show you around

Ilene stands still and hugs herself tightening her
sweatshirt around her shoulders protecting against the wind
She turns to Jimmy who is now face to face with her

ILENE
It’s gotten chilly all of a sudden

JIMMY
I know I get it now why people say
that Sintra is the place where
winter goes to spend the summer

Ilene laughs

ILENE
I’m not sure I understand that
completely but it sounds true

Jimmy takes off his jacket

JIMMY
Here take this

ILENE

something happens to you

(MORE )

JIMMY (CONTD)
Even if this will be a touch big
for you it will at least keep you
warm

He puts the jacket over her shoulders and she wraps it
around herself

They stand silently for a moment
JIMMY (CONTD)
Shall we continue up and see if

the others have arrived

ILENE
Yes Of course

They start walking together higher up the hill

EXT PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 51

On top of the hill Frankie moves slowly along a terrace
outside the abandoned sanctuary a yellow building with
crumbling walls The wind blows and a mist surrounds her as
she walks along But Frankie is paying no attention to
nature Instead she is observing the scene taking place
below

FRANKIE’S POV Frankie sees Jimmy and Ilene They look good
together and there’s a lightness in Jimmy we haven’t seen
before

The wind blows a strong gust and Frankie has to hold the
fragile wooden rail hard

FRANKIE’S POV Jimmy takes his jacket off and puts it over
Ilene’s shoulders

She is an unexpected witness to this gentle action and the
future that it might herald

EXT PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 52
At another spot on the hill Michel stands with his

binoculars to his eyes He drops them and we can see in his
face that he has seen everything

EXT PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 53

Paul is walking up the road when he passes by the ruins of
an old house He slows down when he sees a COUPLE making out
against the walls

The hands of the WOMAN caress the back of the MAN’s head She
is wearing a shiny bracelet

Paul comes closer He can’t believe his eyes but there’s no
mistake this is Frankie’s bracelet on this woman’s wrist
as she strokes her man’s head

The couple is suddenly aware of Paul’s presence and they
pull apart They are the flower sellers Bianca and her
boyfriend Joao Miguel who were last seen fighting earlier
on They see Paul and decide to leave

Paul keeps on his way but turns around to catch a glimpse of
the couple walking hand in hand going down the road The
Vendor steals a kiss on the Bianca’s neck while she laughs
very much in love

EXTINT PENINHA SANCTUARYABANDONED CHAPEL - DAY 54
We see a small chapel perched on top of the hillside

Frankie is inside an abandoned ruin made of stone walls and
wooden floors Instead of doors and windows just their gaps
between walls

It’s dark quiet and there’s nothing to see like a death
chamber Frankie touches the walls feeling the rock and
listening to her own footsteps She sees a stream of water
running down the old wall She extends her hand and feels
the water on her skin

Outside a few clouds fly by against the still blue sky
taken by strong winds

Frankie hears a sound and in the rear of the chapel almost
in darkness she sees Tiago with his cell phone and a lit
cigarette

He and Frankie look at each other for a moment warily and
then Frankie starts moving slowly leaving the Sanctuary and
heading towards the light outside

EXT PENINHA SANCTUARY - DAY 55
Frankie walks outside the chapel and onto a rocky pasture
The wind blasts and a cloud blows intermittently against the
sky She tightens up her jacket protecting herself against a
sudden chill

She walks ahead to the edge of the cliff in front of her
and the long drop below

Frankie looks out to the sea Time stops for long moment
And then she turns to see what’s behind her

Coming to meet her from different directions are Jimmy and
Ilene and Paul Not far are Ian and Sylvia with Maya behind
them In the rear is Michel with Tiago helping him navigate
the rocks and the climb

And then as if always Jimmy is beside Frankie He puts his
arm around her She feels his presence his body his weight

and then -- before the others have even fully arrived to see
the view -- Frankie is ready to go ready to continue
FRANKIE
On y va

And without pause or hesitation she leads Jimmy and the rest
back towards the town back towards what’s ahead for her for
all of them

As she arrives at Michel he puts up a fuss for a moment as
to missing the view But Frankie insists and he and Tiago
turn around and follow the rest as the head down and away

Clouds come and go

And then the sky clears up momentarily and we marvel at the
spectacular view of the sun setting on the entire Sintra
coastline down below - the mountains the towns the tree
tops the white beach and the infinite ocean
