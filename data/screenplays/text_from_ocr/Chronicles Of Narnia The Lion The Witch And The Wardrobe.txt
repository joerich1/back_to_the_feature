dwarf
jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs

Dwarf puts knife to Edmunds throat

WHITE WITCH

EDMUND
He wont let go

DWARF

Narnia

WHITE WITCH
Id love to see your family

EDMUND
Theyre nothing special
WHITE WITCH
I have no children of my own and you
are such a good little boy (I never
could hear those words right) where
I could see one day you becoming prince
of Narnia - maybe even king

EDMUND
(mouth full) Really

WHITE WITCH
(nods) Of course youd have to bring
your family

EDMUND
Theyre nothing special

EDMUND
Oh Peter will be king too

WHITE WITCH
No But a king needs servants

EDMUND
I-I guess I could bring

em
WHITE WITCH

Beyond these woods do you see those

two little hills My house is right

between them Youd love it there Edmund

it has whole rooms simply stuffed with

Turkish Delight

EDMUND
Couldnt I have some more now

WHITE WITCH
NO (smiles) Dont want to ruin you
appetite

WHITE WITCH
Im going to miss you Edmund But we
are going to see each other soon

EDMUND

WHITE WITCH

and Ed is left alone)
LUCY
Edmund Oh Edmund (hugs her brother)
I saw Mr Tumnus again and hes fine
The White Witch hasnt found out about
him helping me

EDMUND
The White Witch

LUCY

She calls herself the Queen of Narnia
but she really isnt Edmund Are you

EDMUND
Well what do you expect Its freezing
How do we get out of here

LUCY
Come onthis way

BACK IN ENGLAND

LUCY
(turns on the light and jumps on Peter)
Peter Peter wake up Its there its

PETER
(rolls over still half asleep) Lucy
what are talking about

LUCY
Narnia Its all in the wardrobe like
I told you
Susan comes in
SUSAN

Oh Lucy youve been dreaming
LUCY

No I wasnt I saw Mr Tumnus again
Oh and this time - Edmund went too

PETER
You saw the faun

LUCY
Well he didnt actually go there with
me What were you doing Edmund

EDMUND
I-I was just playing along You know
what little children are like these
days they just dont know when to stop
pretending (sits on his bed looking
smugly at Lucy)

Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room Susan runs

after
her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over
EDMUND
Ow
Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor
she looks

up a little frightened and then starts her crying all
over again
hugging him

MRS MACREADY
You children are one shenanigan shy
of sleeping in the stable- oh Professor
I told them you were not to be disturbed

PROFESSOR
Oh its alright Mrs Macready - Im
sure theres a logical explanation
But I think this one needs some hot
chocolate

MRS MACREADY
Yes Professor Come on dear

Mrs Macready takes Lucy down the hall Peter and Susan
turn
to go

PROFESSOR
Ahem (the two turn and follow him
into his office and the Professor sits
at his desk and takes some tobacco out
of its silver apple case and puts it
in his pipe)
PROFESSOR
You seem to have upset the internal
balance of my housekeeper

PETER
We are very sorry sir it wont happen
again

SUSAN

Its our sister sir Lucy

PROF
The weeping girl

SUSAN
Yes sir shes upset

PROFESSOR
Hence the weeping

PETER
We can handle it (takes Susans sleeve)

PROFESSOR
Oh I can see that

SUSAN
She thinks shes found a magical land
in the upstairs wardrobe

PROFESSOR
What did you say

PETER
The wardrobe upstairs Lucy thinks shes
found a forest inside

Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits
in a chair
across from them

PROFESSOR
What was it like

SUSAN
Like talking to a lunatic

PROFESSOR
No not her - the forest

PETER
Youre-youre not saying you believe
her

PROFESSOR
No not her - the forest

PETER
Youyou actually believe her

PROFESSOR
Well dont you

SUSAN
Well logically it couldnt possibly
be there

PROFESSOR

What do they teach at these schools

PETER
Edmund said they were only pretending

PROFESSOR
And hes the more truthful one is he

PETER
No this would be the first time

PROFESSOR
Well then id your sister isnt lying
and isnt mad then logically we must
assume that she is telling the truth
Shes your sister isnt she Youre
a family Its high time you start acting
like one

CRICKET

PETER
Peter winds up goes for the bowl

Ball hits Edmund in the leg
EDMUND
Ow

PETER
Whoops Wake up Dolly Daydream

EDMUND
Cant we play hide and go seek again

PETER
I thought you said that it was a kids
game

SUSAN

Besides we can all use the fresh air

EDMUND
Not like theres air inside

PETER
Are you ready then

EDMUND
Are you (smacks his bat on the ground

and gets ready to hit the ball)

Peter pitches the ball hard and Edmund whacks it good

and it

smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a
suit of

armor

UPSTAIRS

The children are looking at the broken window and the
suit of

armor on the floor

PETER
Well done Ed

EDMUND
You bowled it

SUSAN
Listen Mrs Macready is coming
PETER
Run

EDMUND
(runs to the wardrobe and opens the
door) Come on

SUSAN
You have got to be joking

PETER
Go

SUSAN
Get back

SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING

Susan and Peter fall backwards

IN NARNIA

SUSAN
Impossible

LUCY
Dont worry its probably just your
imagination

PETER
I dont suppose saying were sorry would
quite cover it

LUCY
No it wouldnt But this might

Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball he throws
one back
at her and a snowball fight
begins Susan hits Ed in the arm with one
EDMUND
Ow (rubs his arm) Stop it (They all
realize that Ed lied)

PETER
You little liar

EDMUND
You didnt believe her either

PETER
Apologize to Lucy (He just looks at
her)

PETER

Say youre sorry (Peter steps up to
him)

EDMUND
Alright Im sorry

LUCY
Thats alright some little children
just dont know when to stop pretending
(looks at him smugly)

EDMUND
(mutters) Very funny

SUSAN
Maybe we should go back

EDMUND
Cant we at lease take a look around

PETER
I think Lucy must decide

LUCY
I all want you to meet Mr Tumnus

PETER
Well Mr Tumnus it is (walks into the
wardrobe again)

SUSAN
We cant just walk around in these clothes

PETER
(comes out) We can use these coats

SUSAN
Peter they dont belong to us
PETER
Well I dont think the professor will
mind And if you think about it logically
we are not even taking them out of the
wardrobe (Hands coat to Edmund)

EDMUND
But thats a girls coat

PETER
I know

DISCOVERING NARNIA

Edmund is walking through the courtyard and sees Giant

Rumblebuffin

He walks further in and sees a stone lion - he draws
glasses

and a moustache on it

Edmund continues through the courtyard he steps over
what he

thinks is a log of some sortonly to be lurched on by
Maugrim

MAUGRIM
Stand still stranger

EDMUND
Im a Son of Adam I met the Queen in
the woods

Maugrim gets off him

MAUGRIM
My apologies fortunate favourite of
the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate

MAUGRIM
Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious
throne and sits on it longingly Then
the witch comes up behind him and says
scaring him half to death)

WHITE WITCH

MRS BEAVER

Lucy falls howling

LUCY
Theyre in the tunnel

(run further comes to dead end)

MRS BEAVER

BEAVER
There was no room next to the jam

He jumps out of the hole Everyone else follow Once
Peter gets

The Fox stays on lower ground The Beavers and the
children are
in a treethe wolves approach

Wolves break through barrier as Fox is out in centre

information

MAUGRIM

Lucy cries out Peter shushes her

the fox looks around hopelessly and then hangs his
head in shame

FOX
They they were heading North

MAUGRIM
Quickly smell them out

they cast aside the fox where he lays whimpering on
the ground

Mrs Beaver is patching up the Fox as the children
listen to
his tale

LUCY

FOX
Well I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite

He winces in pain and continues to talk

MRS BEAVER
Stop squirming Youre worse than beaver
on bath day

MR BEAVER
Worst day of the year

FOX
Well I am afraid that is all the healing
I have time for

SUSAN

PETER

Everyone gasps

ASLAN
His offence was not against you

WHITE WITCH
Have you forgotten the Deep Magic

ASLAN

I was there when it was made

WHITE WITCH
Then you will know that the boy belongs
to me (turns to crowd) That boy (points
to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table

PETER
Come and take it then

WHITE WITCH
You think that a simple threat will
deny me my right little king Aslan
knows that if I do not have blood as
the law demands all of Narnia will
be overturned and perish in fire and
water

ASLAN
Enough I shall talk with you alone
(time passes and the Witch exits tent)

ASLAN
The Witch has denounced her claim on
Edmund

Narnians cheer

WHITE WITCH

kept

Aslan roars the White Witch falls into her seat and
the Narnians
laugh The White Witch leaves Aslan sighs and walks

More jeers and catcalls

WHITE WITCH
Tonight the Deep magic will be appeased

WHITE WITCH
You know Aslan Im a little disappointed
in you Did you really think that by

Human boy Ha You are giving up your
life and saving no one So much for

WHITE WITCH
In that knowledge Despair and

She plunges in the knife and Aslans growls in pain and
his eyes
slowly close

WHITE WITCH
The great cat is DEAD

Her army cheers loudly
WHITE WITCH

for battle However short it may be

Otmin lets out a huge roar
AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE

The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan Lucy gets

GRYPHON

SUSAN
What have they done

Aslan appears sending shivers down EVERYONES spine

SUSAN AND LUCY
ASLAN

Aslan laughs

SUSAN
We saw the Witch the knife

ASLAN
If the Witch knew the true meaning of
sacrifice she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic a little differently
For she would know that if a willing
victim who had committed no treachery
died in a traitors stead the Stone
Table would crack and death itself would
begin to unwind

SUSAN
We sent the word that you were dead
Peter and Edmund would have gone to
war

LUCY
(draws knife) We have to help them

ASLAN
We will but not alone Now climb on
my back We have a long ways to go and
