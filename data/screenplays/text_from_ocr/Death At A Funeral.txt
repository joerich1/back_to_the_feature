ELAINE
Norman shut up
Elaine turns back around Norman is irritated by this

REVEREND DAVIS
Id like to start with a favorite
passage of Edwards from First Samuel
chapter 18 verses 1-4 in the King
James Bible
(READING)
And it came to pass when he had made
an end of speaking unto Saul that the
soul of Jonathan was knit with the
soul of David and Jonathan loved him
as his own soul And Saul took him
that day and would let him go no more
home to his fathers house
While the reverend is talking Norman pokes Elaine on the
shoulder and leans forward

NORMAN

(WHISPERS)
Hey Elaine I know you dont think
Im part of the family--

ELAINE
Cause youre not

NORMAN

(WHISPERS)
-but when you dissed me back there

sitting next to him smacks his wrist down
ANGLE ON Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar Oscar is
fidgeting and looking worried

Blank faces stare back at Aaron Cynthia looks pained
Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly

Alabama on a farm He loved to take
long walks in the woods with his close
friend Bobby He told me how they
spent their summer days riding their
bikes through the fields and swimming
in the lake

Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance but battles

with his eulogy

AARON
He said he was a nice man and
surprisingly well dressed When Dad
was eighteen he left home after an
argument with his father He never
told me what that argument was about
but I do know that after leaving South
Carolina sadly he and Bob lost touch
and never saw each other again Dad
went to college where he studied
accounting a decision which lead to a
career in corporate finance But
the

who

jumps

his real passion was for the arts

with a particular fondness for

theatre dance and musicals He was a

charter member of the Negro Ensemble

Company and contributed regularly to

the Alvin Ailey School of Dance

in his tank
Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron

finally
shouts across the room
AARON
MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN
Everyone including Frank and Cynthia looks at Aaron
stunned

They all freeze Theres a long silence

AARON (CONTD)
He had his shortcomings but he
took care of his family He loved his
family He loved this house He
worked hard All I wanted today was
to show him how much we all loved and
admired him To give him the respect
that he deserved Is that really so
much to ask We all get so distracted
by the little things in life We
forget about the important things
Like the fact that we lost a great
man
The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention

AARON (CONTD)
So maybe he loved Dreamgirls more
than most men We dont know why a
man makes the choices he makes But I
do know that my father made the best
choices he could make Life is
complicated Were just thrown here
together in a world filled with chaos
and confusion and we do our best
And Dad did his best

of

go

Aaron looks over at the coffin Ashe speaks we see shots

Cynthia Frank Jeff Norman Duncan as they are moved by
Aarons words

AARON (CONTD)
He taught us to go for what we wanted
in life because you never know how
long youre going to be here And
whether you succeed or you fail
the important thing is that you tried

A beat Michelle looks up at her husband with pride We see
the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening

AARON (CONTD)
So when you all leave here today I
want you to remember Dad for who he
really was A decent loving man
who never condemned anyone for how
they lived Who never cast
disparaging remarks or held prejudices
against race gender height If
only we could all be as giving as
generous as understanding as my
father Even dead my father has
more character than everyone in this
room If I am half the man my father
was my child will be incredibly
blessed
Aaron turns and walks out of the room Everyone watches him

Michelle follows him out of the room
