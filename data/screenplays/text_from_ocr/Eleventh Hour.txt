EXT COUNTRY LANE NIGHT 200A

Zoom A small and shabby van bullets past us and away down a
long country lane

A beat when all seems to go quiet and then
A police traffic pursuit car rockets past in its wake all

lights flashing and the howler sounding closing the distance
between them

EXT COUNTRY LANE NIGHT 201

Looking ahead driving at speed everything seen by the
headlight beams Stone walls overhanging branches the
occasional cluster of dark buildings but not another car or
living soul
INT SANDERS’ VAN NIGHT 202
The driver Martin Sanders grips the wheel and stares ahead
as the vehicle barrels through the night Fear has sobered
him somewhat
He’s gabbling miserably
MARTIN SANDERS
My cup overflows Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me

In the side mirror the beams and flashing blue lights of the
pursuing cruiser come into sight

He glances at the mirror

MARTIN SANDERS
Oh crap

EXT COUNTRY LANE NIGHT 203
The van rips past us and away in a dizzying whip-pan and a
deafening roar A second or so of near-silence and then the
cruiser rips through the frame in close pursuit

INT POLICE CRUISER NIGHT 204

Traffic cop Elaine driving supercool

Partner Mike on the radio while checking a map
MIKE
(calmly into radio)
Saw us and exited the pub car park
at speed Vehicle is now heading
West on Higher Commons Lane
INT SANDERS’ VAN NIGHT 205

Martin Sanders growing visibly more desperate glances down
at something on the passenger seat beside him

Another check on the mirror but the cruiser’s still there
INT POLICE CRUISER NIGHT 206
Mike looks up from the map
MIKE

There’s no turnoff now until the

Cable Road
EXT HILL ABOVE TOWN NIGHT 207
A north-country road high on the brow of a hill with the
lights of a valley town spread out in an immense carpet

beyond

A police city van is coming up the road and over a radio
link we hear

VAN DRIVER
(radio)
On the Cable Road now
We pan with it as it drives by and away

INT SANDERS’ VAN NIGHT 208

Martin Sanders reaches for a button and the driver’s window
opens

Visibly upset he glances down at something on the passenger
seat

MARTIN SANDERS
God forgive me

EXT COUNTRY LANE (WOODLANDS) NIGHT 209
POV from the pursuing cruiser For a moment there’s no

clear view of the car ahead but we see a flash of something
leaving it

INT POLICE CRUISER NIGHT 210
Elaine’s spotted the action

ELAINE
He threw something out of the car

MIKE
(looking back as they pass
the spot)
Near a white gatepost

EXT T-JUNCTION (WOODLANDS) NIGHT 211
Here comes the shabby van hardly slowing for the turn

At it takes the corner the bigger Police Van is arriving at
the junction

The Police Van brakes sharply and Sanders’ vehicle swerves to
avoid a head-on collision leaving the road and ploughing
into a ditch

NT POLICE CRUISER NIGHT 212
Elaine pulls in by the crashed vehicle

She and Mike get out and move in Others from the police van
follow

Sanders isn’t hurt but he’s in tears at the wheel
EXT COUNTRY LANE (WOODLANDS) NIGHT 213

Later A white gatepost is briefly illuminated by slow-moving
headlight beams

And now we see why Mike walks at the roadside scanning the
ground with his flashlight He’s backlit by the beams of the
cruiser creeping along behind him at 2 or 3 mph

Almost immediately he spots something He signals for the
cruiser to stop and then moves in for a closer look

ANGLE ON THE VERGE pushing in on a small bundle wrapped
in medical-grade paper towel It’s about the size of a bag of
sugar and secured by a cheap silver chain with a crucifix
Impact has loosened the wrappings

Mike crouches shining his flashlight onto it from all angles
and then reaching in to lift a corner
We don’t see what’s revealed But we see Mike’s face in the
reflected glow of his flashlight beam

MIKE
Oh

EXT WOODLAND BURIAL GROUND DAY 215

Big closeup of Bruno a senior CID officer His eyes scan a
scene of disturbing awe

The scene before Bruno -- we see that we’re in a sloping
woodland of widely-spaced trees The ground between the trees
has been taped off into areas like an archaeological dig The
ground is peppered with holes like tiny open graves marked
with numbered flags

Some have been dug out already Others are being worked on by
forensics officers in cool-looking properly fitted blue
Scene Suits

DS Cook is carefully picking his way across the ground
towards Bruno following the marked way

At one hole a small cardboard evidence box is being draped
in a black cloth

DS Cook reaches Bruno

DS COOK
Did you authorise some government
bloke to enter the evidence tent

Bruno looks at him sharply Clearly he didn’t
INT EVIDENCE TENT DAY 216

One of the boxes stands open on a table Professor Alan Hood
in latex gloves has opened one and is carefully lifting a
silver cross and chain out of the way while Rachel Young his
personal protection officer looks on She’s holding a manila
file

HOOD
(looking at the crucifix)
The man who buried them put one of
these in every grave
Rachel looks into the box She’s too professional to react
Just about

HOOD
It’s one thing to hear about it
But it’s coming face to face that
really brings it home

She’s going to say something then changes her mind

HOOD
Would you rather wait outside

RACHEL
I’ll be fine Thank you

The flap is thrown open and Bruno storms in

BRUNO
What do think you’re doing

HOOD
(replacing the lid)
You don’t have to worry inspector
I do know how to handle a sample

BRUNO
I don’t care I’ve got thirty dead
babies and the last thing I need is
for my evidence to be interfered
with Out

Hood turns to him stripping off his gloves

HOOD
Strictly speaking you’ve got
thirty dead foetuses Can you read
a DNA profile

BRUNO
Are you from the lab

HOOD
No Can you

As he’s speaking Rachel hands him the file in exchange for
the gloves

BRUNO
I don’t know what you mean by
‘reading it’
He moves to the side of the tent and indicates for Bruno to
join him

Bruno not quite sure how his momentum’s been stolen glances
at Rachel and then complies

From the file Hood takes an A5-sized sheet of X-ray film
showing the familiar banded pattern of a DNA profile

HOOD
Think of it as a personal barcode
Each one’s different and each
one’s unique

He slides the top edge of the sheet under the crossbar of the
tent’s frame so that it stays there making the backlit
fabric into a makeshift light box

HOOD
This is the profile for the twelve-
week-old foetus that was thrown out
of the car

He adds another next to it

HOOD
And this from the first one you dug
up What do you see

BRUNO
They’ re similar

HOOD
(adding a third)
They’re not similar They’re the
same As are all the others Look

He holds up a fourth for comparison and then starts moving
back down the row gathering them into a stack like playing
cards

HOOD
Every one you’ve sent in for
testing so far The same The
same The same
Angle on the sheets -- in a single stack with the lines
perfectly matched up
HOOD

What do you know about cloning
BRUNO
I’ve heard of Dolly the Sheep

Hood turns to look back and now we see that there’s a grim
row of fifteen of the boxes perfectly spaced along the
trestle tables all labelled all separate

HOOD
What you see here is the disaster
you get when you try it with
people

BRUNO
Who are you

HOOD
I’m Alan Hood

216A EXT WOODLAND PARKING AREA DAY 216A

Rachel’s by the car trying to make a call but frustrated by
the lack of a signal as DS Cook approaches

DS COOK
So Special Branch are doing
drivers now

RACHEL
I’m not his driver I’m his
bodyguard

DS COOK
What does he need a bodyguard for

RACHEL
Somebody bombed his car once If
you want to make him blush ask him
where the shrapnel is And
If that look means you’re about to
start taking the piss save it for
your mates back in Trumpton

DS COOK
Don’t knock it If I keep my nose
clean and find enough stolen bikes
maybe someday I’1l1 get given an old
bloke to look after

Red rag to a bull

RACHEL
That ‘old bloke’ is a science
troubleshooter for the government
(MORE)
RACHEL (contd)
And don’t think he’s in it to make
himself popular There’s at least
one multinational with a dirty-
tricks department gunning for him

DS COOK
(backing off)
Okay

RACHEL
You want to try a week on the road
with him You’d soon change your
tune

DS COOK
I said okay

RACHEL
(regaining face)
I need a hotel for tonight

DS COOK
All the road warriors come straight
off the motorway and into the
Novotel (beat) It’s not far from
my house

RACHEL
That ought to be worth a discount

EXT WOODLAND BURIAL GROUND DAY 217

Bruno leads Hood along the access route taped out by Scenes
of Crime Officers

HOOD
The man you arrested Is he a
microbiologist or a medical man

Bruno thinks this is hilarious

BRUNO
Hah

HOOD
What’s so funny

BRUNO
You haven’t seen him He’s a
caretaker Says he’s been getting
twenty quid a time to incinerate
the bundles Once he realised what
they were he couldn’t bring himself
to stick ’em in the fire

HOOD
Or give up the twenty quid Who’s
been paying him

BRUNO
He won’t say a thing now he’s
sobered up We’1ll see how he feels
after Accessory to Murder

HOOD
Technically a foetus is medical
waste Can that still be murder

BRUNO
All right then Something under
the abortion act

HOOD
Clone foetuses abort themselves
They nearly always go wrong

BRUNO
Well for God’s sake Then you’re
telling me I’m wasting my time

HOOD
You’ re not wasting your time This
isn’t about scratching around for
something to pin on a caretaker
It’s bigger than that

BRUNO

It can be as big as it likes I
need a crime and a charge If I
don’t have that I move on So what
are you telling me

HOOD
That you’re looking at evidence of
an attempt at human cloning

BRUNO
And I’m Flash Gordon

HOOD

It’s the twenty-first century
Inspector At least make an effort
to keep up

At one of the graves something’s being lifted out into a
waiting box and a cross and chain dropped in after

HOOD
t’s the work of a man who’s been
trailing this kind of misery across
half of Europe

BRUNO
Fine Give me a name

HOOD

I don’t know his name No-one even
knows what he looks like When they
get close to him in one country he
moves on to another He’1ll keep on
doing more of the same until sheer
chance gives him a live birth

BRUNO
Why

HOOD
Fame fortune and a place in
history And you’re looking at the
cost If you won’t go after him
get out of the way and I will

217A EXT WOODLAND PARKING AREA DAY 217A

Rachel waits alone by the car as a very dark-of-brow Hood
comes stalking back to her He talks on the move

HOOD
I just about persuaded him to flag
it up with local hospitals Thirty
babies in thirty graves You know
what that says to me

RACHEL
I can’t even guess

Gets straight into the car
HOOD
Thirty mothers How do you keep
them quiet
And slams the door

INT SUPERMARKET DAY 220

Kelly Fox 19 years old and 20 weeks pregnant is pushing
along a trolley with a toddler in the rumble seat studying a
list Her pregnancy isn’t screamingly obvious and the clothes
that she’s wearing make it even less so

She only belatedly notices that the child’s holding a packet
of biscuits

KELLY
No Davy Not the fancy ones

She extracts them from his grasp and we pan with her as she
goes the few yards back down the aisle to replace them

Then without a cut we pan back with her to the trolley which
now has no kid in it

KELLY
Davy David

With rising panic she looks all around her

Then moves past the trolley to the aisle junction As she
turns the corner

She sees directly ahead of her a young guy with baseball cap
and trackie pants tucked into his Nike socks He’s got Davy
with him and is squatting down by the sweet shelves
unwrapping something to put in the boy’s hands

ROLY
There y’are Take that from your
dad

Kelly freezes in horror Roly sees her and rises

ROLY
You didn’t move but five miles Did
you think no-one was ever going to
see you

KELLY
You come near me again I’m taking
you right back to court

ROLY
Yeah whatever you try it and see
what happens A dad’s got a right
to see his lad

KELLY
Oh don’t come that You take an
interest when it suits you and it
doesn’t last five minutes

Kelly spies what Davy is eating

KELLY
That’s got nuts You know he can’t
have it

She moves to take it from him and Roly catches her by the
arm

ROLY
Hey

He’s noticed something He shoves her out to arm’s length for
a better look and she makes a feeble attempt to cover the
signs

ROLY
You going to tell me that’s all
Dunkin’ Donuts Whose is it

KELLY
Get off

ROLY
I asked you a question

The volume’s rising and people are starting to take notice

KELLY
It’s none of your business

ROLY
You needn’t think you’re having it

KELLY
Get off

He smartly hustles her to a spot no more than a stride away
where a stack of stuff in the aisle obscures them from
general view

Something nasty happens just out of our line of sight
An instant later Roly is walking away briskly hands thrust

in pockets at a speed that will have him out of the store
before anyone can act

An elderly woman starts raising the alarm She’s got one of
those walker-trolleys and can only shout from the spot

ELDERLY SHOPPER
I saw what you did You nasty
little bastard You should be
ashamed of yourself

Kelly is clutching her stomach doubled-over and sinking to
her knees

Roly sweeps on and out of the store unimpeded

CCTV insert as he passes the checkouts -- he tilts his head
so that the baseball cap hides his features from the camera
Someone’s trying to call after him but he doesn’t break his
stride

Back in the aisle -- Kelly’s doubled up hugging herself
still not able to make any sound as people start coming to
her aid

INT SUPERMARKET DAY 221
Another part of the store Kelly’s been seated on a chair
She’s breathing deeply wiping at tears with a tissue A
shelf-stacker lad hands her a paper cup of water

MANAGERESS
Dan

The lad looks at her and with a flick of her eyes she
signals for him to move away

Then she bends over Kelly and lowers her voice for
discretion

MANAGERESS
Have you stopped bleeding
KELLY
Think so
MANAGERESS
You’ve got to let me call an
ambulance
KELLY
(emphatically)
No
MANAGERESS

Well I’ve got to call someone

Kelly looks up There is someone

222 EXT SUPERMARKET DAY 222
Kelly is being helped from the building by Lena Muller 40s
A tall woman dark and a bit sinister One of the staff leads
Davy by the hand another brings Kelly’s shopping

They cross to where a slightly shabby dark car waits at the
kerb with its hazards blinking

We can hear Rachel’s voice leading sound over the end of the
scene

223 INT HOOD’S CAR DAY 223

On the move Rachel at the wheel Hood beside her Still dark
of mood and pensive

RACHEL
So do we try and find this woman

Hood stirs and starts paying attention

HOOD
Which one

RACHEL
The one who paid the caretaker to
burn the foetuses

HOOD
I can’t get to her until they let
me talk to him

RACHEL

You need to cut the local bobbies a
bit of slack Hood How often do
you think they come up against
something like this

HOOD

Human cloning a crime that brings
all of science into disrepute and
gets you ten years in jail What’s
so complicated about that

RACHEL
Nothing if you’ve got a PhD

HOOD
Bloody coppers Thick as they come
Present company excepted How far
are we going

RACHEL
I’ve booked us into the Novotel

HOOD
Does it have a gym

RACHEL
What do you want a gym for

HOOD
I like to ogle women in Lycra

They pass a junction sign

RACHEL

I thought your daughter lived in
this neck of the woods

HOOD
She does

RACHEL
Are you going to call her

HOOD
I might

He doesn’t sound too keen Rachel glances his way with mild
surprise

EXT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 224

Just off the motorway A big run-down old cotton mill that’s
been converted for business units It’s barely a step above
dereliction

INT BUSINESS UNIT DAY 225

At first we’re close on Lena and Davy The woman is chatting
to him brightly keeping him distracted by letting him play

with some medical stuff -- tongue depressors bandages Only
when she glances across do we see that this is

A big bare space In the middle of the old floor stands an
island of modern furniture and medical instruments the
centrepiece being an obstetrics examination table under an
overhead operating light

Kelly’s lying on the table Dr Sidney Hayward 50s runs a
compact ultrasound scanner over her bulge and studies the

results in a laptop screen Hayward is a former consultant
His patrician manner is intact even if the bespoke suit has
seen better days

SIDNEY HAYWARD
I think we’re all right I don’t
see any damage The placenta’s a
bit low down but that will probably
sort itself out

He hands her a towel and closes everything down while she’s
wiping off the lube and rearranging her clothes

KELLY
Would I still get paid if anything
did go wrong

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Not if it leads to a termination
Don’t blame me it’s my boss who
sets the terms Why Are you
worried about anything in
particular

KELLY
Just asking

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Asking’s free But if anything does
go wrong you call me and I’11 do
what’s necessary Don’t even think
about going to your doctor

KELLY
I’ve only got you

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Good You know what they do with
girls who break the law

Kelly glances in Lena’s direction
KELLY
If she can’t drive me back can I

have some taxi money

SIDNEY HAYWARD
What’s wrong with the bus

KELLY
Bus fare then
225A

Hayward hesitates fails to come up with an evasion then
roots around in his trouser pockets for change

SIDNEY HAYWARD
How much is it from here

KELLY
Three pounds

Lena Muller looks across at the scene with a face like a
plate of condemned veal

Hayward reluctantly sorts through his small change trying to
make up the three quid

INT BUSINESS UNIT DAY 225A
A short time later
Kelly’s leading Davy out The door closes after them
Lena Muller joins Sidney Hayward
LENA MULLER
What’s the point sending her out
again

SIDNEY HAYWARD
She’s worth a few more weeks

LENA MULLER
I don’t know why you didn’t just
terminate her right there

SIDNEY HAYWARD
If you believe the scan she’s got
the most viable-looking foetus yet

LENA MULLER
She’11 never hold onto it

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Bit longer and it might be worth
inducing

LENA MULLER
What if it won’t wait

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Then she’d better be sure she gives
me a call Unless she particularly
wants to die
FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK

EXT POLICE YARD DAY

Rachel’s sitting behind the wheel in the parked car

standing beside it to make a personal call

HOOD
Hello Miranda It’s daddy I
assume you’re not there or it’s not
convenient to pick up the phone
so just to let you know I’m in
the area for a while Give me a
buzz if you feel like it Usual
number

He ends the call and gets into the car

RACHEL
Everything all right

HOOD
I assume so You know what it’s
like She’1l be busy

RACHEL
Heads up

Sanders is emerging from the building

HOOD
Is that the boy

Hood’ s

Right behind Martin Sanders and without his awareness DS
Cook steps out of the doorway and points him out in near-

pantomime fashion

RACHEL
That’s the boy

She starts the car

With Sanders -- he’s leaving the police yard when the car
brakes to a halt ahead of him and Hood steps out He opens

the car’s rear door by way of invitation

HOOD
Martin Sanders

Sanders starts to take a step back but now Rachel’s moved in
right behind him

MARTIN SANDERS
Who are you

HOOD
Professor Alan Hood Guess what I
want to talk about

From his pocket he produces the silver cross and chain and
dangles it before Sanders

MARTIN SANDERS
Where’d you get that

HOOD
I stole evidence There Now you’ve
heard my confession I’m ready to
hear yours

MARTIN SANDERS
The magistrate said I can go

HOOD
Good for the magistrate Last
chance to come on board Martin
Your own free will

MARTIN SANDERS
Get lost

With an air of mild regret Hood nods to Rachel and sets off
around to the other side of the car

Sanders suddenly finds that Rachel is crowding him toward the
open vehicle door He’s about to protest when she bangs her
knee into his thigh in what in the playground we would have
called a ‘deadleg’

Suddenly it won’t take his weight and she grabs him to
steady him

RACHEL
Sorry Did I do that Sorry

Sanders protests but isn’t able to resist as she bundles him
into the back of the car

Where Hood now waits

As Rachel goes back around to the driving seat she catches
DS Cook’s eye across the yard

And winks
INT HOOD’S CAR DAY 230

On the move Rachel at the wheel Hood and Martin Sanders in
the back

HOOD
Twenty quid a pop and you couldn’t
quite bring yourself to pass it up
You’d make a lousy businessman
Martin Between the crosses and
chains and the Dutch courage I
think you’1l find you were trading
at a loss

MARTIN SANDERS
You can’t do this It isn’t legal

HOOD
Apparently you were helpful drunk
and useless sober What’s best to
do with you Martin Take you to
the pub

MARTIN SANDERS
I’m not saying anything else

HOOD
Have you got no conscience You
won’t get a better chance to ease
it

MARTIN SANDERS
Jesus knows what was in my heart
And he’s forgiven me

HOOD
Let’s ask him

INT CHURCH DAY 231

A gloomy town-centre Victorian Gothic church pretty small
Hood marches Martin Sanders down the aisle toward the altar
rail with Rachel following after

Sanders’ leg is still trailing and Hood’s helping to support
him but the effect is that of dragging him up the aisle by
the scruff of his neck
HOOD
If the only thing that impresses
you is the wrath of God then make
no mistake as far as you’re
concerned I am his instrument right
here on Earth You think you did
right by the unborn dead Think
again Who paid you to burn that
medical waste

MARTIN SANDERS
Just some woman

HOOD
She didn’t come out of nowhere and
she didn’t pick you for no reason
Who is she Martin and where can I
find her

MARTIN SANDERS
I’m already in trouble I don’t
want more

HOOD
Don’t you Well you picked the
wrong day to meet me then didn’t
you

A side door opens

PRIEST
What’s going on

Hood relaxes his grip turns it into a friendly hand-on-
shoulder

HOOD
Sorry for the noise father I
always get a bit passionate ina
theological discussion

PRIEST
Give me a better reason than that
or take it outside

HOOD
We were talking about the slaughter
of the innocents Whether it was
all down to Herod or whether the
footsoldiers and spear-carriers
need to shoulder some of the blame
What do you say Martin

On Martin His eyes flick from Hood to the priest He has no
ready answer

EXT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 232
The converted mill we saw earlier

Hood’s car comes into the mill yard and stops

INT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 233

A crude conversion -- partition walls and numbered units
each with the owner’s custom-made security on the door

Hood and Sanders are by the door to the unit 118 They’re
waiting for something As they talk Hood inspects the chunky
padlock on its hasp

MARTIN SANDERS
I’ve never had a key

HOOD
Don’t you worry about it

Hood moves to the plasterboard wall alongside the door and
gives it an experimental tap

HOOD
If the whole thing troubled you so
much why didn’t you stop

MARTIN SANDERS
He who rides a tiger can never
dismount

HOOD
You weren’t riding any tiger You
were cremating human foetuses for
money

MARTIN SANDERS
I stopped doing that when I found
out what they were

HOOD
But you didn’t stop taking them on
Why

MARTIN SANDERS
Who else was going to give them a
decent burial

HOOD
A shallow grave and a couple of
prayers

MARTIN SANDERS
And some holy water

HOOD
That’s your idea of decency is it

MARTIN SANDERS
Unless one is born of water and the
Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom
of God

Hood stops tapping the plasterboard

HOOD
What

MARTIN SANDERS
If a baby’s not baptised then it
doesn’t go to heaven

HOOD
So you did them yourself Does that
still count

MARTIN SANDERS
You probably think it’s stupid

On Hood His manner doesn’t change much but his deeper
attitude to Martin does

HOOD
No Martin I don’t

A moment of understanding then
Rachel arrives carrying a set of boltcutters
Hood changes the mood

HOOD
Oy oy Armed feminist

INT BUSINESS UNIT DAY 234

A slow track taking in the big empty space with the island of
modern furniture and medical instruments the centrepiece of
which is the obstetrics examination table under an overhead
operating light now standing dark

CLUNG The sound of the padlock shearing is followed by the
door opening

After taking the sight in for a moment Hood moves toward it
Rachel follows with the boltcutters in her hand Martin comes
in last closes the door and stands close to it

MARTIN SANDERS
There’s two of them She calls him

Doctor

HOOD
Is this where they work on the
girls

MARTIN SANDERS
I wouldn’t know

Hood shoots him a cynical look

MARTIN SANDERS
(admitting)
Couple of times a week Most of
them are only kids

Hood picks up some shiny instrument muses and lays it down
again

RACHEL
You obviously don’t have a
gynaecologist

HOOD
I don’t have anything that would
interest one

RACHEL
You’ re not very happy

HOOD
I was hoping for more than this

Rachel’s by a table with a compact inkjet printer anda
scattering of discarded attempts She holds one up for him to
see

It’s an ultrasound scan from around 11 weeks Printing was
cancelled so the image is unfinished by an inch or two

RACHEL
Hood You’ve got baby scans in a
secret clinic What on earth are
you looking for

HOOD
He may have implanted his embryos
here but he made them somewhere
else It’s a big deal Rachel Big
technology It’s not like your
basic two lesbians and a turkey-
baster

RACHEL
Hood

HOOD
It takes a proper lab and all the
skills to go with it See this

He lays his hand on a container like a milk churn Lifts the
lid but it’s empty

RACHEL
What

HOOD
Liquid nitrogen transporter
(reads label on lid) With an import
license for bovine semen

RACHEL
What’s he making a minotaur

HOOD
That’1l1 be a cover He can hardly
say frozen clone embryos can he
He’s outsourced his lab work to a
country where there’s no
regulation

Their heads turn at a sound as the door to the unit is
opened

Framed in the doorway stands Sidney Hayward with the broken
padlock in his hand and a furious expression

The first person he sees is Martin
SIDNEY HAYWARD
Martin You know you don’t come in
here

Martin can’t help it -- he looks to Hood

Hayward follows his glance

And at the sight of Hood starting towards him steps out
quickly and pulls the door shut

Hood covers the rest of the distance at a run but he’s too
late -- the door won’t open

NT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 235
Closeup on the hasp and staple as the door rattles -- it’s
been closed up and the broken padlock thrust into it so that
the door can’t be opened from inside

A quick pan gives us a parting glimpse of Hayward as none
too dignified he vanishes off down the stairs

NT BUSINESS UNIT DAY 236

Rachel can see that Hood’s getting nowhere

RACHEL
I’1l take him

She turns and heads across the floor to a marked Fire Exit
door with a crush bar

HOOD
Preferably in one piece

Rachel hits the crush bar and an alarm sounds throughout the
building as she heads out

Something then occurs to Hood He lays his hand against the
partition wall by the door

HOOD
(to Martin)
Is this hollow
Martin does a kind of shrug to say As far as I know
Hood brings out a Swiss Army knife or Leatherman which he
opens and plunges dagger-like into the plasterboard at
shoulder height before sawing it downward
EXT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 237

Rachel’s following a designated escape route that exploits
the visual possibilities of the building

NT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 238

Hayward reaches the bottom of the stairs and heads toward
daylight

NT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 239
A big ragged section of plasterboard being booted out into
the corridor with Hood stepping through after in a cloud of
white dust

He heads for the stairway

EXT BUSINESS PARK DAY 240

Hayward reaches his car and drops into the driving seat
Something like an old BMW swish in its day but auction-
fodder now

Not a man of action -- he’s flustered and panicking He
fumbles his keys and has to retrieve them from the floorwell

EXT BUSINESS UNIT BUILDING DAY 241

Rachel completes the escape route and reaches ground level on
a different side of the building

EXT BUSINESS PARK DAY 242

Hayward gets his car started and backs out of his parking
space in such haste that he clips the next vehicle

Then he shifts to forward but as he sets off
Hood stands in the way of his exit
Hayward doesn’t slow but presses hard on the horn

On Hood hand raised in a signal to halt realising that
Hayward intends to do no such thing

HOOD
Ah

When Rachel suddenly appears drawing her 9mm Automatic and
tracking the car as it heads straight for Hood and it’s going
to run him down if she can’t stop or divert it

She’s aiming low and it’s BANG BANG without success at the
tyres before she raises her aim and fires at the car itself

On Hayward -- both rear side-windows are blown out as the
bullet passes through the car and Hayward’s terrified
reaction is to duck and violently jerk the wheel

Angle from above -- the swerving car narrowly misses Hood

On Hayward -- terrified but recovering control

She runs forward But by the time she reaches Hood Hayward’s
around the corner of the building and gone

She’s incandescent and she doesn’t hold back one whit

RACHEL
You stupid old man What do you
think you were doing

HOOD
Me

RACHEL
Do you think my job’s a joke I’m
supposed to keep you safe and look
how you carry on

HOOD
Well I’m sorry but that’s the
last thing I was thinking about

RACHEL
Tell me something I don’t know

Rachel returns the firearm to its concealed holster and
storms toward their car

INT HOOD’S CAR DAY 243
Both get in Rachel slams her door There’s an atmosphere

RACHEL
I discharged a firearm at a moving
vehicle Do you know what I’11 have
to go through now

She makes an effort to calm herself

HOOD
I am sorry

RACHEL
(not looking at him)
Let me go Hood Please

HOOD
Your job is far from a joke And I
do need you

RACHEL
You’d get the exact same support
from any one of a hundred people

INT KELLY’S FLAT DAY (INTERCUT) 244A

Kelly’s in social housing and may not have been trained in
housekeeping skills but it’s as decent as a 19-year-old
single mother can make it

She’s reading to Davy It’s a child’s book with pictures but
still she struggles with the words

KELLY

(reading)
“And that’s the end of the story
except to say that all of the
guests went back to their homes
and told stories of the kindness of
Mondrago their king And when the
word of his kindness had spread far
and wide”

Ouch She winces with a sudden pain

KELLY
Oh god no

She puts a hand to her stomach and fights the pain At this
moment her phone rings

Kelly moves into the kitchen where her phone’s plugged into a
wall socket charging

We stay and push right in on the cream-coloured cushion she
was sitting on to find

Blood patches freshly soaking into the material
With Kelly -- wiping her eyes she answers the call

KELLY
Hello

EXT STREET DAY 244B

First we see the back windows of Hayward’s car with sheet
plastic taped to replace the shot-out glass

Through the plastic we see something blurry moving

And then we shift our point of view to see that it’s Lena
Muller hastily deserting their crummy back-streets flat with
a couple of suitcases As she brings them around to the open
boot we find Sidney Hayward on his mobile just putting his
own bag in

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Kelly it’s Doctor Hayward Stay
away from the clinic We’ve had a
bit of an emergency Has anyone
been to see you

KELLY
No What if I have to call you

SIDNEY HAYWARD
You can still call me just don’t
go back to the building Is there a
problem

KELLY
(feigning okay-ness)
No

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Good Stay healthy have this baby -
- everyone wins

He ends the call
LENA MULLER
(scornfully)

Everyone wins

SIDNEY HAYWARD
We should get out now

LENA MULLER
And do what Look at us Look at
this

She points at the plastic covering the car windows

SIDNEY HAYWARD
That’s what I mean I was shot at
It was like the Wild (f£g)
West

He does that thing where you censor yourself but the word
leaves a shadow

LENA MULLER
And where do you think we’re going
to go You can’t even cover a
child’s bus fare If it’s going to
be like this then Luciano has to
pay you more

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Oh yes He’1l go for that

LENA MULLER
It’s all right for him He’s miles
away We’re stuck here looking
after the girls and taking all the
chances

SIDNEY HAYWARD
Well that’s hardly going to be
news to him is it As far as he’s
concerned it’s the whole point of
the setup

LENA MULLER
Then start talking up how promising
the new one is See if that loosens
his wallet ’Cos we’ll all be quids-
in if one of them beats the odds

SIDNEY HAYWARD
You think that’s the answer

LENA
Isn’t it

SIDNEY HAYWARD
If any one of those freaks of
nature ever does draw breath
that’s the day the real trouble
starts

INT HOOD’S CAR DAY 245
Parked on a busyish street where there are flats and houses

Hood and Rachel sit in the car Rachel’s calmer now They
seem to be watching for something

HOOD
Cloning’s a numbers game It’s a
fluke if one comes right You make
a thousand little monsters to get
your one little angel

RACHEL
Why’s he doing it here

Hood looks at her

RACHEL
You tell me how tricky these
maverick cloners are Moving it
around whenever there’s a ban So
why not do the whole thing in some
third world country

HOOD
Maybe I’1l1 get the chance to ask
him

RACHEL

Maybe this is where his client is
Hood looks at her again more seriously
RACHEL
How much is it costing Someone’s

got to be paying

Hood’s mind is so taken with the implications of this that he
almost misses his reason for being here

RACHEL
Is that your daughter

Quickly he returns his attention to the street

A young woman has emerged from one of the houses She’s
stopped to double-lock the door behind her

RACHEL
Well

Hood starts to undo his belt then

HOOD
What am I doing This is stupid

RACHEL
Get a move on You’1ll miss her

then checks the window lock and closes the curtains

He rummages around in his coat pocket and digs out a small
signalling device no bigger than a zippo lighter

He blows the fluff off before showing it to her
RACHEL
(patiently)
Switch it on
He slides the thumb switch on the side
RACHEL

In case you didn’t notice it your

You can leave the room but don’t

(scene relocated from police yard day and moved from 246)

DS Cook is standing in the foyer Hands in pockets waiting
killing time in motel limbo

He wanders across to look at some piece of hotel art that’s
not worth looking at

Suddenly

Rachel comes striding through the swing doors from the rooms
corridor

RACHEL
Doug Thanks for this

DS COOK
I’m five minutes away

RACHEL
I know I remembered I need to
give you this

She holds a metal disc out to him

DS COOK
What is it

RACHEL
The lid from a container for
refrigerated bull semen

DS COOK
Now you’re embarrassing me ’cause
I haven’t got a present for you

RACHEL
(patiently)
There’s a customs label on it Do
me a big favour and find out who
applied for the import license

DS COOK
That’s your close protection work
is it Admit it you’re desperate
for some proper coppering

RACHEL
I am not desperate for anything
But Professor Hood and I would
appreciate a result

She walks away back toward the doors

DS Cook glances at the lid and its label

But finds Rachel walking away more interesting
INT HOOD’S HOTEL ROOM NIGHT 251B
(relocated from police building day and moved from 247)

Closeup on Hood’s computer laptop screen He’s got it plugged
into the room’s internet access point

It’s showing a website news page very similar to the format
of the BBC news pages The news column carries the headline
GYNAECOLOGIST BANNED and a column-width picture of someone we
don’t know above the text

Hood clicks a link in the ‘See also’ column and another story
takes its place DISGRACED SURGEON STRUCK OFF and another
picture we don’t recognise

A knock at the door

HOOD
Yes

Hood clicks again as Rachel enters the room on a key
HOSPITAL SPECIALIST SUSPENDED

RACHEL
I forgot to leave your key What’s
with the charm squad

HOOD
Struck off

RACHEL
All I did was ask

HOOD
These are all gynaecologists who’ve
been struck off the medical
register If you need a
professional for something illegal
then you’ll find one among the
fallen

As he’s speaking up comes a photo of Sidney Hayward

RACHEL
Isn’t that ours

picture shows a smoother better-groomed Hayward in a pause-

RACHEL
He could be doing both

Hood looks around How to explain

HOOD
Give me your tweezers

Puzzled Rachel takes out a jellycard and pulls the tweezers
from it

Hood meanwhile takes a green grape from the mixed bunch on
the room’s underwhelming fruit basket He holds it up between
thumb and forefinger

HOOD
This a woman’s egg The pip inside
it is the nucleus with her unique
DNA To make a clone you first get
rid of her nucleus

He plunges the tweezers into the grape stem hole
RACHEL
(wincing)

Hood

The tweezers come out with a grape pip which he discards

HOOD
And replace it with a nucleus from
any cell of the person you want to
clone I need a different grape

RACHEL
I’1l imagine

HOOD
No it’s not the same

Jump cut to a pip being pulled from a black grape

Jump cut to Hood inserting the new pip into the original
grape

HOOD
Original egg new DNA in the
nucleus Shock it with a little
jolt of electricity

He gives the grape a little flick

HOOD
Which fools it into thinking it’s
been fertilised Within a week

He holds up the small cluster of half a dozen black grapes

HOOD
-it’s making stem cells that will
develop into the person of your
choice You put this embryo back
into a woman and then and only
then does our incompetent
gynaecologist enter the picture

Rachel reaches over retrieves her sticky tweezers with an
expression of distaste

He could be the one who found the

saying she was bleeding to death

He said that

He kicks the bed and gets some satisfaction as Lena Muller

jumps
SIDNEY HAYWARD
Look if you pull the plug now
that could be the end of it You’ve
seen how Luciano protects himself
You think your son will thank you
if you pass up your last chance

Gifford takes a moment

Hayward briefly covers the phone and gestures to Lena Muller

SIDNEY HAYWARD

Get your pouty arse in gear He’s
trying to bail out on us

Then back to the phone as her jaw drops

bleak but he’s not sure how

police case goes into the database
Doesn’t matter if the girl herself
isn’t in there You can look for a
blood relation with points of

similarity

HOOD
So you don’t even have to be in the

Without even looking Rachel produces a notepad from

HOOD
Thanks

Now he starts to pat his pockets for a pen

With similar economy of movement Rachel reaches up and pulls
a pen from his sun visor

Hood clicks the pen Then keeps clicking it because he can’t
make it work

Kelly sitting upright on the sofa now a blanket around her
shoulders Lena Muller’s cleaning Kelly’s face up with wipes
taking off the tearstains and the smudged mascara

KELLY

I’m sure I can still feel it
moving

Don’t you worry The doctor’s
making the arrangements

She puts a clean wipe into Kelly’s hand and leaves her to
carry on in a weak and halfhearted manner as she heads to
the door

At the door Lena Muller opens it expecting to see
Hayward

But it’s Roly He’s not expecting her either

He stops it and shouts past her into the flat

Oh Hood As if

HOOD
That’s a yes really isn’t it

She doesn’t reply -- she’s double-checking numbers on the
doors as they pass

HOOD
I’m going to take that as a yes

RACHEL
Is this the one

The door’s wide open

Hood starts forward but Rachel stops him with a light hand
against his chest

Makes a finger-against-lips gesture for silence and then
points to a spot at a safe distance from the door

Hood retreats to it without question Rachel doesn’t take out
her gun but unbuttons for quick access as she goes in

We stay with Hood Watches the door looks all around
Rachel comes out less tense taking out her phone
RACHEL
She’s not here The boy’s in his
playpen And there’s a man with a
pair of surgical scissors in his

neck

Not too happy about it

Hood goes in as Rachel speaks into her phone

RACHEL

A rusty low-rent minicab is pulling away from the house and
as it clears our line of sight we see Gifford walking toward
the door

INT GIFFORD’S HOUSE DAY 299

Gifford comes into the main room He doesn’t see Rachel
waiting behind the door but we do

She reaches out and closes it just as he’s realising that
Hood’s in the room

He looks this way and that momentarily wrong-footed Then

GIFFORD
(pissed off)
Oh great

HOOD
You know what’s happening today

Yes I do

HOOD
Then tell us where they took Kelly

Forget it You’re not going to
interfere

Look I know you think I don’t
understand what you’re going
through Where’s your wife

GIFFORD
Don’t think you can get it out of
her She left me

HOOD
I think I can guess why

GIFFORD
Because I’m obsessed All right
What of it

HOOD
Mine died two years ago

GIFFORD
I’m sorry

HOOD
So am I I had to nurse her through
her last illness and every single
day of it I’d find some little sign
to let me think she might get
better Do you think I don’t have
the same dreams as you There isn’t
a day goes by when I don’t wish her
back

GIFFORD
Don’t tell me that’s the same I’m
sorry but it isn’t One of you
dies first it’s sad but that’s the
deal Try losing a child Because
that’s the day you die too You’re
all rotten and dead on the inside
and the outside’s just a shell that
walks around Your life is over but
the pain goes on

HOOD
That’s grief It’s natural

GIFFORD
know and they call it the price
tag on love Well I don’t accept
it

HOOD
What’s your answer then Because
what you’re trying can only make it
worse

GIFFORD
Not possible

HOOD
Don’t make me prove it to you

GIFFORD
I’m going to see my son again and
there’s not a thing you can do
about it

Hood stops
He’s reached the end of his road He’s given it his best

shot but it’s clear to him now that nothing he says is going
to make any difference

He meets Rachel’s eyes A barely perceptible lift of his
head which sets her moving

HOOD
Just remember that I didn’t want it
to come to this

GIFFORD
All right then What’s coming now

Rachel moves to Hood’s side We now see that she’s brought in
one of the cardboard evidence boxes which she gives to him

HOOD
You want to see your son again

Hood holds the box up in front of Gifford and opens the lid
For a moment Gifford doesn’t understand what he’s looking at
HOOD
This is just one of them They’ re

still finding more

Then he understands but he can’t quite believe that Hood
would do this

In the end he just stares down into the box blank with
shock

Hood moves around beside him and speaks with persuasive
urgency

HOOD
Even if he survived the damage
this would never be the boy you
knew He’d be some other different
child

Gifford raises his gaze to stare at Hood

HOOD
What price your little angel now

Gifford looks back into the box He’s broken now and about
to fall

HOOD
I can’t speak for the child that’s
being born But the girl who’s
carrying him will die if you don’t
help me

EXT PRIVATE CLINIC DAY 300

Hood’s car comes tearing down the driveway and halts in front
of the entrance

Hood jumps out Right there before him is Hayward’s car with
its crudely-repaired windows

As Hood and Rachel head into the building Lena Muller is
just emerging

Without knowing who she is Hood stops to speak to her

HOOD
Do you know where they put the
teenaged mother who came in today

LENA MULLER
I’m sorry I don’t work here

Hood and Rachel head on in

Lena Muller turns her head to watch them She has the eerie
calm of someone who’s seen that it’s the time to cut and run
and can do so without doubts

Taking a breath and settling her shoulders she turns and
walks off up the drive

has focused on something beyond him

within

Hood can see that he’s now surplus to requirements He rises
to go
