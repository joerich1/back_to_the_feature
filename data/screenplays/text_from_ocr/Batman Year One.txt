in his face

His hands tremble Distant THUNDER sounds

EXT EAST END SIDEWALK - MORNING
LITTLE AL a gigantic early middle-aged black man carries a
bag of doughnuts and two coffees

He whistles as he walks through a run-down slum

He stops and inserts a key at a grimy storefront The sign
reads AL and Son Repair Service Salvage

REVERSE SHOT OF INT ALS GARAGE - MORNING

LITTLE AL hits the lights revealing a meticulously clean
auto repair shop

LITTLE AL

LITTLE AL continues his search in the-
EXT JUNK YARD BEHIND ALS GARAGE - MORNING
Its a dreary dirty isolated place

Its sole occupant BRUCE loads large car parts onto a
flatbed TRUCK bearing the AL and Son logo

He carries the heavy transmissions and engine blocks on his
broad muscular shoulders

LITTLE AL
Morning sunshine

BRUCE says nothing he just STARES at LITTLE AL with
troubled tired eyes

LITTLE AL (CONTD)
(Hands BRUCE a coffee)
OK twinkle toes Lets take a look
at the job orders

The two head up a wooden staircase over the garage and enter—
INT BRUCE WAYNES APARTMENT - MORNING
Its the claustrophobic room of an obsessive compulsive
Neatly organized electronic hobby projects line the walls—
POLICE SCANNERS RADIOS and TVs Their readouts and displays
provide the only light
LITTLE AL opens the blackout curtains Sunlight pours in

leaves

As BRUCE closes the blackout curtain his gaze lingers

across
the street on the girls galore peepshow theater From the
looks of it the sleazy sex venue was once a GRAND THEATRE

But now on top of its classic old-world facade a pink
plastic sign promises GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS Out front

prostitutes offer their wares

CHI-CHI a young PIMP with long greasy hair and felt bell
bottoms SLAPS a fat whore she CRIES and APOLOGIZES

Other whores usher men into a brownstone CATHOUSE next door
BRUCEs gaze travels to a window directly across from his
Inside the CATHOUSE a long lean black woman SELINA puts
handcuffs on a skinny man She wears tight fitting black

leather

SELINA notices BRUCE and gives him a playful wave He closes
the curtains Leaving us alone in

INT BRUCB WAYNES APARTMENT - MORNING
BRUCE sits and writes a letter
BRUCE (VO)

Finished BRUCE puts the letter in an ENVELOPE Then gets up
and goes back to work

INT JAMES GORDONS APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

THUNDER rolls on the night air

In the sweaty palm of JAMES GORDON rest six bullets GORDON
sits in his boxers on the toilet In his mouth he holds his

SERVICE REVOLVER

ANN (OS)

GORDON looks up at the door He puts the gun with its wet
barrel into a holster with a badge clipped to the side and

leaves the bathroom

ANN (OS) (CONTD)

INT POLICE PRECINCT SOUADROOM - MORNING
GORDON gets off the elevator and walks through the busy
precinct room full of COPS

As he passes CONVERSATIONS STOP

Men with shoulder holsters and badges on their hip watch
GORDON with obvious disdain

GORDON puts his lunch in his desk and flips through papers
He lights a MARLBORO

INT POLICE PRECINCT HALL OUTSIDE EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

A sign reads Evidence Room A YOUNG COP stares at GORDON
with bad intent through a Plexiglas window

GORDON puts papers in the pass-through

GORDON
This is for the Irwin case

The YOUNG COP doesnt say a word

As GORDON leaves he passes the door to the evidence room
Its half open

We catch a quick glimpse inside—

two detectives stuff YELLOW ENVELOPES and stack BILLS
--before the door SLAMS shut

INT BATHROOM POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

GORDON stands at a URINAL as DETECTIVE FLASS about 40 blond
crew cut enters

GORDON
Come on Flass I told you I just

FLASS
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy youre going
to have to learn what it takes to
be a cop in this town

FLASS (CONTD)
It makes the guys nervous when
someone doesnt participate They
think you might say something

GORDON
Its not like that I just dont
need the money
Maybe if I had kids like the other
guys or had trouble making ends
meet it would be different

FLASS
The guys are saying maybe he
thinks hes better than we are
Maybe he thinks hes superior Is
that how it is Jimmy You think
youre some kind of saint

GORDON
No its nothing like that

FLASS
So youre not a saint Gordon Who
are you

GORDON

Im just a cop
FLASS
Yeah thats right youre one of
us
FLASS jams a yellow envelope into GORDONS hand and leaves
GORDON CRUSHES the YELLOW ENVELOPE
INT SQUADROOM POLICE PRECINCT - MOMENTS LATER

FLASS jokes around the water cooler with a couple COPS

Then back at his desk he sees the YELLOW ENVELOPE spiked on
his message post

FLASS registers a look of concern

FLASS partner DETECTIVE CAMPBELL a fat cop in a wrinkled
suit slaps him on the shoulder

CAMPBELL
Come on well deal with him later
We got to make our rounds

screwed by a whore

FLASS pulls away

FLASS (CONTD)
We dont have time for this Got to

FLASS waves his BEER CAN farewell as he drives off

CHI-CHI
What the hell was that You made me
LOOK BAD I got a REP to maintain

cops take advantage try to push me

around

SELINA
You know the rules Nothing for
Free

SELINA jerks her arm free and storms off
But CHI-CHI grabs her again and SPINS HER AROUND
CHI-CHI
Well maybe its time we RE-EVALUATE

the rules

Suddenly CHI-CHI is aware that BRUCE stands very close
glowering at the pimp

PURE UNHOLY HATRED

CHI-CHI
What the fuck you want retard

CHI-CHI flicks open his SWITCH BLADE
SELINA
(to CHI-CHI)
Leave him alone
CHI-CHI backhands her across the mouth

BRUCE oblivious to the knife moves to take out CHI-CHI

But SELINA catches BRUCEs eye and WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
tells BRUCE to let it go

BRUCE just turns and walks away— an obedient soldier

CHI-CHI
Thats what I thought WIMP

Selina watches BRUCE march back into—

tumble to the ground

punches to their faces — POP POP POP

But its with numbers six through 16 that he runs into
trouble They work as a team and surround BRUCE

The first one smashes BRUCE with a chair —
Then another clocks him in the head with a whiskey bottle —
And a third belts him in the jaw with brass knuckles

BRUCE staggers back The men descend and beat him to the
ground

We lose sight of BRUCE under a rain of KICKS PUNCHES
BOTTLES and SWINGING POOL QUEUES Then suddenly BRUCE —

leaps up onto a pool table

The sign shatters

SPARKS SHOWER DOWN

Hes swollen and bruised
GORDON
You wanted to see me sir

LOEB
Yes Gordon I heard about the
unfortunate incident the other day
(sarcastic)
Funny youd think a trained police
officer would have no problem with
thugs in the precinct garage

GORDON
Yes you would

LOEB is taken back Was that some kind of jab He continues

GORDON suppresses a smile hopeful

LOEB (CONTD)

rid of me I cant let Loeb push me
aside that easily Ive got to
compile the evidence Noone needs to
take them down

ANN
OK honey But come to bed soon

She gives him a kiss and leaves GORDON resumes typing
GORDON (V O)
Section fourteen Commissioner
Loeb Based on interviews and my
direct contact with the
commissioner I believe it is
possible the commissioners
involvement goes far deeper than
the kickback slush fund Loeb may
be CONTROLLING all organized crime
in Gotham City As of now these
allegations are mere speculation I
dont have the resources to pursue
that line of inquiry

GORDON sighs lights another MARLBORO and goes back to work
INT GOTHAM JUSTICE BUILDING BASEMENT - MORNING

GORDON walks down dark stairs along a long corridor down
more stairs past dripping pipes through a door down

another hallway with flickering lights to the door to —

INT GORDONS NEW OFFICE - MORNING

On the walls hang maps with numbered pins police sketches of
THE BAT-MAN and photos of the MARKS on victims faces

As GORDON enters a young police officer MERKEL jumps up

MARK OF THE BAT
GORDON

The doctor stops to inspect the chart for a man in bandages

GORDON
(to MERKEL)
Do you notice anything about these
men
MERKEL

You mean the mark of the bat
GORDON
No Im talking about their spirit

These men are broken Scared

MERKEL looks around HES RIGHT Some of the criminals are
even crying

Just then the doctor opens a door for the cops

DR WALLACE

In the corner of the padded room cowers the former shell of a
once-tough street pusher His haunted eyes are framed by
stitched-up wounds that still very much resemble a bat

DENT
A hunch Arent you supposed to

GORDON
Thats what I need you for I cant

DENT
OK Im listening

GORDON
After we spoke I got to thinking
about the CAMPBELL murder He was
killed INSIDE one of ESTRADAs
cathouses just before the
vigilante appeared And ESTRADAs
prostitution ring has been hammered
by the vigilante

DENT
So you think ESTRADA can lead you
to THE BAT-MAN

GORDON

I still dont get it

inside one of ESTRADAs warehouses

Betty closes the window and gets back to her life

We follow his progress but have trouble seeing him We catch
a glimpse as he LEAPS from a high building across an alley
onto the fire escape on the other side

Then hes gone over the lip of the roof

This is THE BAT-MANs environment elevator rooms dripping
with tar the water towers the TV antennas ABANDONED

giant full moon watching an —

into the gutter DISGUSTED

The cops drive off moments before CHI-CHI arrives in his car
and hobbles on crutches inside the —

INT EAST END WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

CHI-CHI makes his way through rows of stacked cardboard boxes
and rolls of carpet

Then its slowly and painfully up a flight of wooden stairs
to an office the kind with glass windows overlooking the
warehouse and high glass skylights

In the office five young men drape themselves over leather
sofas smoking and throwing potato chips at a group of
young malnourished women who cower on the floor

SANCHEZ an older fat man sits behind a desk on the phone

SANCHEZ
(into the phone)
They just left Yeah they had a

A shower of glass drops from an overhead skylight
THE BAT-MAN lands on SANCHEZ desk
A terrifying demon of the night Pure menace
THE BAT-MAN
Gentlemen Im here to ask you a

few questions

The men are stunned— paralyzed by fear until SANCHEZ pulls an
UZI from a holster and fires a volley at THE BAT-MAN

BUT HES GONE
The bullets strike CHI-CHI in the CHEST HE GOES DOWN

THE BAT-MAN is in the air he somersaults over the men on the
sofas

Smoke Bombs fly from his fingers

POP POP POP POP

Then its all shadows and confusion

Guns fire

BAM BAM BAM

Bones CRACK

People SCREAM

Guns - CLICK CLICK CLICK - empty

Finally a body smashes through the plate glass onto the
warehouse floor A chimney effect takes place The smoke no
longer trapped is quickly sucked out the broken skylight

leaving THE BAT-MAN and SANCHEZ the lone people on two feet

SANCHEZ in shock clicks his empty gun
The women break for the door and scatter into the night
A man clutches his throat and writhes on the desk

Without ever removing his eyes from SANCHEZ THE BAT-MAN
draws a knife and jabs it into the choking mans throat

Instant tracheotomy
The man can breathe he slides relieved to the floor

THE BAT-MAN
Now then where is your boss

THE BAT-MAN grabs SANCHEZ by the head with both hands

THE BAT-MAN (CONTD)
Where is ESTRADA

SANCHEZ
Down docks new girls

To be thrown aside and forgotten

A third gets CRUSHED UNDERFOOT as THE BAT-MAN continues to

Its been a tough fight Hes sweated through his clothes
lost his cape but the action only makes him stronger A GLOW
OF EXCITEMENT shines off him

THE BAT-MAN (VO) (CONTD)
There is only one man I am looking

And now before him ESTRADA tries to muster some composure
Hes run out of men to fight for him and stands surrounded by
half-starved Asian women with hate in their eyes

Theres an immediate change in ESTRADAs attitude

THE BAT-MAN sits in his LINCOLN CONTINENTAL across the street
from the police station In the morning light it looks more
like a souped-up limo than a demon car - ALMOST

THE BAT-MAN is totally messed up His clothes hang in
tatters Blood puddles in the foot-well of the car

He listens to the tapes of ESTRADAs confession —

ESTRADA (VO)

THE BAT-MAN turns off the machine and looks out his tinted
window

GORDON storms out of the precinct house

A dazed and rumpled looking ESTRADA (newly released) and
FLASS (his releaser) share a smile at GORDONS obvious fury

THE BAT-MAN (VO)
The enemy is everywhere even HERE
These so called policemen nurture
the cancer they breed it in men
like ESTRADA and turn it lose on my

GORDON watches them go by before knocking on an office door
marked Dr Patricia Holcomb MD PhD Director

INT PATRICIA HOLCOMBS OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Patricia Holcomb is a handsome woman reaching early middle

age with all the dignity that could be expected of someone
who spends their lives surrounded by the criminally insane
GORDON
Thank you for seeing me doctor
Ill try not to take up much of
your time

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Not at all detective Ive been
following your vigilante case with
some interest An intriguing mind
I look forward to hosting it if
thats possible

GORDON
You say that as if you dont think
were going to catch him

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Im not sure you can not alive
anyway Ive read the files you
sent over They describe a man who
inhabits a delusional world of
great danger and violence

GORDON
Danger and violence Sounds about
right for the East End

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Ah but this mind inhabits a world
more horrible than the East End
A world so threatening and
dangerous that its had to create a
new persona a new IDENTITY to
cope

GORDON
This guys become a demon in order
to fight his demons

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Exactly Now normally this kind of
delusion represents the terminal
stage of a suicidal psychosis

GORDON
Hes trying to kill himself

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Yes and no Something is keeping it
going A quest or a mission of some
sort Much like the crusaders in
ancient Europe who were capable of
great feats by virtue of their
belief or faith

GORDON
You mean flying X-ray vision
DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Nothing like that I assure you
More like mothers lifting cars off
children during emergencies Or
even monks and Yogis whos faith
allows them to do incredible things
with their bodies

GORDON
So how do I catch him before his
faith does any more great feats
to the citizens of this city

DOCTOR HOLCOMB
Im afraid thats your problem
Detective My job is knowing what
makes them thick not what makes
them run I will tell you
this though that mind is starting
to enjoy its work Its capable of
anything

GORDON
Come on doctor what do I DQ How
do I stop him before he kills
someone

DOCTOR HOLCOMB

weaknesses What is this great
delusion protecting It didnt just
come into being over night It
started long ago with a young boy
being terribly terribly hurt

A wire runs along the ledge leading to a small contact
microphone attached to the window THE BAT-MAN grins

He reels in his contact mic

prostrate themselves before the car

SELINA lies on his FOUR POSTER BED in his tacky mirror-and
silk bedroom

LOEB
Make yourself at home darling I

then Ill introduce you to a good
friend of mine Hes eager to meet
you

The moment LOEB leaves descending the grand staircase
SELINA dumps her purse on the bed — cuffs whips rubber ball
and a SMALL CAMERA with a long TRIGGER CORD

She finds a hiding place for the CAMERA and strings the CORD
under the headboard

Then she casually begins to case the place — turns over the
CERAMICS to read the brand checks out the SILVER HAIR BRUSH

She grabs a SATIN PILLOW CASE and fills it with loot
She peeks through a gilded door it leads to a staircase
Intrigued SELINA descends to another door that leads to —

MAYOR NOONE
Yes indeed I am very grateful for

to your own umm areas of
expertise and I would like to
pledge to you all —

LOEB
(interrupting)

The arguing continues

LOEB
Think of the big picture Sooner or

The men starting to catch his drift nod

EXT OUTSIDE IN THE BUSHES - NIGHT

THE BAT-MAN has heard all he cares to hear

Hes about to crash the party with the HAND GRENADE he holds
in his fist — two inches from his mouth dangles its circular

pin

Suddenly his head snaps to the side Hes heard something
that we havent Hes not at all pleased

Close up shot of the pin being replaced
INT LIVING ROOM LOEBS MANSION - NIGHT

Three armed security guards burst into the room and catch
SELINA red handed trying to pry open a locked cabinet Shes
tripped an alarm
SELINA turns and without missing a beat assumes a regal air
SELINA
How DARE you enter without
knocking

The men look confused as she approaches

Once she is close enough to the guards she whips off her
leather belt and —

CRACKS

— the first one across the face with the buckle knocking his
gun free

Then —

RIPS
— her long nails across the seconds face

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOEBS STUDY - NIGHT

Three more guards rush toward the door GUNS DRAWN

They burst in to find SELINA securing the two guards together
in a very complicated and painful looking way with her belt

SELINA
Hello my miserable little pets

But these guards arent falling for it —
BAM BAM BAM BAM
— they open fire

SELINA dives behind the desk Bullets rips into the antique
mahogany

The dust settles The guards LAUGH and move in for the kill
When suddenly —
CRASH

A BLACK LINCOLN CONTINENTAL SMASHES into the study taking
out a wall of WINDOWS

CHAOS CONFUSION GUNFIRE SHOUTS

The back end of the LINCOLN FISHTAILS demolishing the
antique DESK and two GUARDS

The front end of the LINCOLN SCREECHES to a stop a WHEEL an
inch from SELINAs face

The DOOR of the LINCOLN SWINGS OPEN

SELINA looks up stunned to see THE BAT-MAN standing up
through the moon roof of the car He holds a BLACK TUBE

A security guard levels his UZI at the pair but before he can
get off a shot —

THANG

— hes hit in the chest with two BRASS PARTS attached to THIN
COPPER WIRES

The wires lead to a massive dripping BATTERY in the car

The guard FLINCHES and FOAMS AT THE MOUTH from the effects of
the PRIMITIVE TAZER
THE BAT-MAN

THE BAT-MAN tosses a GRENADE past her into the STUDY GRENADE

They rake the car with bullets

INT THE BAT-MANS LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - NIGHT

SELINA freaks out as bullets CLINK and CLANK around her
bouncing off sinister looking canisters strapped in the area

where the back seat should be

Keep low and cover your ears

SELINA gives THE BAT-MAN an incredulous look then does
exactly what he says as outside on the —

EXT FRONT LAWN LOEBS MANSION - NIGHT
KA-BLAM

THE BAT-MANs grenade goes off sending a fireball out of
several window and shattering many more

FROM THE FIRE leaps ESTRADA and FLASS GUN BLAZING
Behind him stumbles COMMISSIONER LOEB desperately trying to
pat down his burning HAIR and Mayor NOONE just plain

stunned

ONE BULLET cuts a bloody STREAK across BATMANS shoulder He
pays it no heed

SELINA stares at him A little turned on

The LINCOLN bounces through a wrought iron fence and onto the
tree-lined road
Seconds behind it a pair of white limos give chase

Out on the dark road the LINCOLN CONTINENTAL is almost
invisible driving at ridiculous speeds without headlights

INT THE BAT-MANS LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - NIGHT

THE BAT-MAN drives with crude home-made night-vision goggles
while SELINA appraises the man next to her

Slowly she makes a hand gesture as if she were picking up the
phone With her thumb and pinky she puts the imaginary
headset to her mouth
SELINA
Hello mom Ive met a guy I think
Im in love
THE BAT-MAN
Im taking you to prison for the
murder of a police officer
THE BAT-MAN cuffs her to the dashboard Shes shocked

Out on the road both pursuing limos rip past doing 100 mph

INT PURSUING LIMO - NIGHT
Its a windy tree lined road through the forest

SECURITY GUARD 1
Is he there yet

SHERIFF
(From the radio)

Were in position but he hasnt
shown up

SECURITY GUARD 1
He should be on you any second
Were right behind him Be ready
OH SHIT

As the limo rounds the a corner its greeted by two cop cars
forming a ROADBLOCK

The driver desperately CUTS THE WHEEL but its too late The
big car SKIDS sideways and SMASHES into the cops

The second limo SLAMS into the first
Cops DIVE for cover GLASS AND HUBCAPS go everywhere

Slowly the doors open and dazed security guards get out of
the crumpled cars

SECURITY GUARD 1
Where the hell did he go

Everyone stops and turns to look up the road at THE BAT-MANs
Lincoln Continental as it slowly approaches the crash site

Suddenly — BAM

— super high-powered KLEIG LIGHTS shine forth from the
Lincoln

The men cover their eyes temporarily BLINDED as the ominous
black car accelerates into the wrecked cars

Its heavy bumpers sink into the doors of the cop cars and
grind them backwards and out of the way

Some of the cops and security guards regain their wits and
open fire with their pump action shotguns and uzis

INT THE BAT-MANS LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - NIGHT

A giant gloved fist pounds a series of heavy-duty switches
bolted onto the dashboard

Both sides and the rear of the car erupt — BLAM BLAM BLAM
— road spikes -

FOOH FOOH — smoke -
SPLASH — oil -
CRACK CRACK — and tire-puncturing darts

The gunmen stagger back punctured pierces and slimed by the
cannonade

The Lincoln lays a generous TIRE PATCH as it accelerates
down the wooded road

Behind it the stabbed and oil-covered men can do nothing but
watch stunned as the Lincoln disappears into the darkness

SELINA takes off into the woods

She runs through with a natural animal grace leaping fallen
trees ducking branches moving silently

Give it up SELINA

SELINA spins around looking for the source of the voice

Then breaks into a serious sprint

She runs all out through the woods leaps a stream scrambles
an embankment then out into a clearing Shes really moving
when —

SMASH

— shes tackled by THE BAT-MAN He pins her down in the wet
grass

THE BAT-MAN (CONTD)
You didnt really think you could
run from me did you

She struggles Takes a swipe with her claws but hes ready
for her and easily dodges

murder not even for revenge

SELINA
Whoa slow down

the situation)

She takes his gloved hand off her shoulder and admires the
bat-shaped brass knuckles

knife into the guys shoulder He goes down screaming

The whole SWAT TEAM now aware of THE BAT-MAN turns and
opens fire at the moving cape as it streaks across the LOBBY
Bullets tear through the cape and into old brass mailboxes
THE BAT-MAN throws himself through the hole where the floor

He digs into his belt and pulls out several ROUND OBJECTS

DENT

GORDON
There was more in those files than

GORDON looks at his friend savoring the moment

GORDON

will

He bleeds all over the place from his gut wound His gun now
SLIPPERY FROM BLOOD is hard to hold

least damaged of the three and now holds a MAGNUM in his
hand
