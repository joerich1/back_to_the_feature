INT NIGHTCLUB — NTGHT

The newest and hottest club in the city By the time you hear
about this place it will already be gone

Beautiful bodies shake to thumping MUSIC LIGHTS flash It’s
a booze fueled pleasure zone

And in the midst of this chaos we find one of our heroes Not
hip Not cool Not in shape And totally out of place with
tattered clothes and messy hair But he’s in the VIP section
surrounded by beautiful WOMEN sharing a bottle of Cristal

This is JAY BRENNER As he sprays champagne like he’s in a L’il Wayne video
JAY (VO)

I know what you’re thinking How did a
guy like me end up in a place like this

Girls fawn all over him Guys high-five him

JAY (VO) (CONTD)
I’m not sure either I gotta be at work
in four hours to give the biggest
presentation of my career My night has
involved violence pornography drugs a
dead body and the cops Someone threw up
on me and I’m pretty sure I have two
broken ribs

Jay chugs champagne from the bottle

JAY (VO) (CONTD)
Stuff like this never used to happen to
me I didn’t know it at the time but I
guess you could say I was in a rut

Jay plays air guitar with the bottle The crowd cheers

JAY (VO) (CONTD)
But then a guy told me something that
changed my entire life He said
“Everything you want in this life lies
just outside your comfort zone”

Jay smiles

JAY (VO) (CONTD)
And you know what He was right

WHAM Jay gets punched in the face We FREEZE THE FRAME right
at impact his face contorted into a rubbery mask of pain
spittle flying from his mouth And yeah that’s a tooth

JAY (VO) (CONTD)
Maybe I should start at the beginning

NICK
Those red bumps symbolize freedom

JAY
Actually freedom is moving up in the
world

NICK
Jesus you’re throwing your promotion in

RUSSELL (0S)
Oh you wouldn’t want any monkeys in

RUSSELL DAVENPORT a shaggy slacker pushing a mail cart
enters Webster’s would define him as a lazy mysterious
oddball

RUSSELL (CONTD)
I had a ring tailed lemur once Jo Jo was
a chick magnet but between the biting and
spontaneous shitting the novelty wore
off real quick

Russell cracks open a beer from the cart and takes a sip

Debbie hands Jay his messenger bag

DEBBIE (CONTD)

job but you realized how risky it was and
turned it down

She puts a hand on his shoulder

Run you fat fuck

WIDE TO REVEAL

Durant’s executive office He watches two employees “racing”
each other on a NINTENDO Wii FIT GAME

WAYNE WAGNER the testosterone fueled VP of Sales runs
in place NOVAK a fat executive labors to keep up

They run on electronic touch pads A giant plasma TV displays
a footrace between two animated little girl characters

ROSS DURANT (CONT’D)

competition If you can’t make it on the
Wii how can I trust you with my
marketing division

NOVAK
My left arm is numb I think I’m having a
stroke

Wayne runs harder high-stepping

WAYNE

We go EVEN WIDER TO REVEAL a nervous Jay watching

ROSS DURANT
So what do you think of the Wii

JAY
Oh my nieces love it I hear it’s a fun
game

ROSS DURANT

This isn’t a game It’s an important
exercise to establish competition among
my executives To see who wants it most

WAYNE
I want it sir

NOVAK
(desperate)
I need my pills

Novak crumples to the floor Wayne finishes the race raising
his arms in victory His dress shirt is drenched with sweat

WAYNE
Fuck yeah Don’t bring that weak shit in

Novak struggles to his feet

NOVAK
(to Durant)
Sir I’m sorry I--

ROSS DURANT

absolute losers apply for this job

JAY
Well I’m glad my resume stood out

ROSS DURANT
You were one of them And you don’t have
the job yet

Jay sags

ROSS DURANT (CONT’D)

loser Everyone else was a disaster Like
Hurricane Katrina You were more like a
mud slide in Guatemala that kills twenty
people And who gives a shit about that

WAYNE
IT don’t Fuck Guatemala

ROSS DURANT
So we’re giving you ashot Two weeks

JAY
I’m excited for the opportunity

ROSS DURANT
You should be Because with the economic
downturn we’re eliminating your current
position So if you fuck this up you’re
out of a job

Wayne slams a thick folder into Jay’s chest

WAYNE
And today you pop your cherry Rob
Scanlon at TRW is making noise about
changing maintenance providers So go be
a big swinging dick and convince him

Wayne uses Jay’s tie to wipe sweat from his brow

JAY

Jay steps into the room leveling the gun at Freddie

RUSSELL

out

Suddenly Marco appears behind Jay shoving a gun to his
head He pulls out the DVD from behind Jay’s back

MARCO

Marco takes Jay’s gun and tosses the DVD to Freddie

FREDDIE

louder until the whole room is bathed in a blinding light

Freddie turns to the windows shielding his eyes

FREDDIE

KABOOM A police car CRASHES RIGHT INTO THE HOUSE Freddie
Marco and Shane dive for cover as the out of control car
slams to a halt debris and wreckage everywhere

at Freddie and his crew

Glibby lays down cover fire as Briggs charges forward a
SUPER COP FIRING TWO 9MM AUTOMATICS He BLOWS MARCO AWAY with
a center ring shot to the chest then pins Freddie down by
the hallway emptying his clips He crouches down to reload

Suddenly a battered Shane rises up from behind some wrecked
film equipment pistol in hand

Glibby hurries to reload his shotgun but it’s too late

GLIBBY

Jay leaps up from behind the couch and SMASHES SHANE IN THE
FACE WITH A FIREPLACE POKER Shane drops to the floor

JAY

Briggs slaps cuffs on Shane Then he draws his baton and
BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
