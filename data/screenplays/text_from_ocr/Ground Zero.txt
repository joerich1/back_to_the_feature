Ground Zero

draft 25th January 2007

Shadow Theatre
269 Portobello Rd
London W11
EXT ZONEUS BORDER - NIGHT 1
Darkness Wind Dry Relentless

A rhythmic throbbing like a quickening pulse

There is a flash and a searchlight splits the gloom

The turbid waters of the Rio Grande ripple in the
downdraft of a circling jetcopter kicking back the light
onto the stars and bars on it’s blackened fuselage The
craft hovers like a locust over the north shore sensors
tasting the air Then the drone of its turbines changes
pitch and it banks away into the night

A nervous man with a greying moustache raises his
dripping head from the shadow of a makeshift raft
motioning to his wife and son to resume their paddling
An eight year old girl clings to the raft peering from
beneath a damp tarpaulin as her parents struggle ashore

MARIA
Now Carla we have to walk a little
more

CARLA

Estoy cansado Mama

MARIA
I know Mama is tired too

She lifts Carla from the raft and for the first time the
child feels the barren silt of the United States beneath
her worn out sneakers

CARLA
Tengo hambre

Up ahead is a sagging fence and a bullet scarred sign
bearing the legend “MARTIAL LAW AREA ILLEGAL ALIENS
LIABLE TO BE SHOT BY ORDER US SUPREME COURT”

Carla’s father Abel sets to work with a pair of bolt
cutters the rusted links giving way with surprising
ease His wife Maria watches as their first born son
Rafael follows his father into the wasteland Then Abel
freezes seeing a dark shape in his flashlight beam

RAFAEL
Que le pasa

ABEL
Nada Dead horse Coyotes must have
been at it

The horse’s blackened tongue protrudes from between teeth
that have been laid bare blistered face peeling from the
bone as if burned or melted from within a hole bored
with almost surgical precision in the base of it’s skull
The beast’s remaining eye is milky and cast as a devilled
egg and there is no reflection in it and no world

CARLA
Tengo miedo

Abel turns short hairs rising on the back of his neck
There is a sharp metallic pop followed by a blinding
flash and he realizes too late he has put his foot down
on an anti-personnel mine

White light fills the night breaking up into sparks a
corona of superheated splinters racing out into the dark
Carla sits up not remembering having sat down

A secondary concussion follows an instant later and she
winces as a parachute flare bursts above them like an
evil red star from the book of Revelations tainting
everything with its glow

Abel is still alive staring dazedly past Maria as she
struggles to improvise a tourniquet doing what she can
to tie off his stumps with the hem of her dress His lips
work incoherently trying to draw his wife’s attention to
the line of figures that have appeared from the gloom
behind her moving so silently at first he thinks they
might not be men at all but angels come down to fetch
him Then he hears the purr of servo motors and realizes
they are neither

RAFAEL
Hey

Rafael stiffens firelight glinting on body-armor as a
platoon of hunter killer drone soldiers fan out around
the stricken family drawn by the heat of their bodies
The Mark 13 cyborgs move swiftly and efficiently on
jointed crab like legs executing a precision pincer
movement already picking out individual targets their
steel skulls equipped with the latest wetware
artificially cultured brain tissue that allows them to be
fully auto-independent while still functioning as a
tightly coordinated group with a single voracious
purpose They are cutting edge technology hot off the
assembly line yet their body-armor is already tagged with
gaudy swirling graffiti only half legible in the
firelight Day-glo flags and the names of units what
Reader’s Digest magazine used to call humour in uniform

‘Freedom is Our Responsibility’- ‘Death2Life’
-‘Hasta La Vista baby’
MARIA
Rafael

ABEL trembles losing too much blood too fast The hem
of her dress can’t hold it

Rafael raises his hands his three dimensional heatshape
locked in the drone soldier’s crosshairs

—-RAFAEL
We surrender okay

( )

The steel death’s heads are impassive pinprick laser
trackers sparking in their sockets seeing right into
him into his heart into his blood into the light at
Rafael’s core
RAFAEL (cont )
Por favor

He takes a half step back the air seeming to thicken
about him rippling as if it were quicksilver He opens
his mouth to shout something a warning perhaps but all
that emerges from Rafael’s lips is a thickening wisp of
blue grey smoke and a painful belch of hot gas His hands
fly to his scalp and Carla starts towards him catching
the acrid smell of burning hair For an instant a tongue
of fire dances like the holy ghost above her brother’s
head Then he explodes as if he had a bomb in his guts a
hot rain dewing Carla’s upturned face

The child spins whimpering as the Mark 13 Stormtroopers
turn their microwave cannons towards her tightening the
bandwidth The anti-personnel weapons are totally silent
hot enough to hurt at a distance but gruesomely effective
at close range

Carla stumbles the ground undulating beneath her feet as
a steel claw erupts from the dirt razored talons
reaching for her ankles microwaves scissoring above her
close enough to tan her shoulderblades Yelping she
propels herself on all fours back across the minefield
towards her stricken parents but then a flailing multi-
limbed drone bursts like a trapddoor spider from the
fallow soil between them cutting off any hope of escape
Carla turns wiping the blood from her eyes as the beast
looms over her twin hypodermics sliding from the
underside of its painted skull gleaming tips dripping
with psychoactive neurotoxins

MARTA
Dejala Jodido bicho

Carla dimly hears her mother’s cries as Maria tries to
draw the cyborg away and the whine of servo-motors as the
beast considers its options Then its telescopic neck
snakes aside the air seething about Maria as she tries
to flee clawing at her dress and hair blistering hands
utterly failing to shield her from the tiny invisible
particles that are cooking her from the inside out

The stormtrooper hops over her husbands cooling body
playing with her for a beat as if excited by her jerky
pain wracked movements Then tiring of its sport it
deploys its cutting tools deftly catching Maria by one
ankle and forcing her legs apart flesh and tortured
muscle no match for piston driven polymer Carla hears a
titanium tipped drill whine into life and her mother’s
shrieks rise at least an octave high and shrill as a
bird in the dark

( ) 1

There is a terrible obscene smell Like frying bacon
Carla wants to look away but instead draws herself to her
feet forcing herself to see what happens next to see it
all She no longer makes any effort to run yet the drones
seem to be having trouble locking on to her She is so
small and cold still wet from the river that her thermal
profile is barely recognizable as human

One of the steel beasts pauses inclining its armored
head towards her microfilament feelers probing the air
purring quietly as it conducts a fuller analysis

Carla catches her breath biting the back of her hand
seeing the words ‘Hi Mom’ daubed jauntily across the
drone’s forehead and her own reflection hanging inverted
in the dark lenses of it’s artificial eyes For a moment
it holds the child’s violet heatshape in its crosshairs
watching the fear bleeding visibly out of her in clotted
adrenal tendrils It can’t tell if her tiny shivering
form is human and a potential threat or just another
desert creature but to be on the safe side it decides to
cauterize her anyway recalibrating its microwave cannons
accordingly

Then deep within the cyborg’s brain something sparks

A tiny wire fails and a new circuit meets a stream of
mutant data disabling the override and countermanding the
stormtrooper’s programming

The Mark 13 cyborg emits a low barely audible trilling
sound as it disengages its weapons gazing mutely at the
terrified child as if somewhere deep within the bio-
mechanical matrix of its wetware the tin soldier has felt
the first faint flickering of self awareness

INTERIOR NIGHT OP CENTRE 2

Banked monitors line the armored train compartment giving
the mobile operation centre the appearance of a
television station conducting a particularly savage
outside broadcast Each screen displays the point of view
of one of the drone soldiers each one a distinct
mechanical consciousness an autonymous unit monitored at
a safe distance by a trained operator

Jay Schneider private first class is one such operator
less than a year out of high school and already a skilled
technician an expert in his chosen field

SCHNEIDER
Fuck you little cocksucker
I’m fuckin’ done

Schneider snaps the neck off an ampule of pseudo-

endorphins and designer RNA snorting it’s contents as
he switches to manual

( )

SCHNEIDER (CONTD)
Software’s fucked up dude
Doesn’t want to track

A young woman with buzz-cut hair and a sillicon stud in
her nose glances up from the neighbouring station Her
flash identifies her as Rudnick K Private first class

RUDNICK
Barlowe ain’t gonna like this

She double clicks on her mouse alerting the systems
analyst slouched in his soft plastic chair towards the
back of the open plan compartment listening to the
vaguely feminine machine voice on his headphones as he
waits for his long distance call to be connected

Matt Barlowe is in his early forties jaded former whizz-
kid and principal software designer to the Mark 13
project pointman for Fairisle the civilian contractors
behind one of the largest technological projects in
American history

OPERATOR (0S)
Ringing for you

Matt’s eyes fall to his screensaver A hologram of a
horsey looking redhead hugging two kids with expensive
dental work He reaches for his coffee but as he raises
the sticky plastic cup a verdigris colored fire ant
climbs his forearm biting him below the elbow

BARLOWE
Jesus fuckin’ Christ

He swats the tiny insect rubbing the reddening welt it
leaves behind

RECORDING (VO)
You’re talking to a machine

BARLOWE
Hey Charmian Matt Look if the
balance hasn’t cleared there’s gotta
be something wrong at your end
Machine error I dunno Happens all
the time with that branch Just hang
tough and you know I’11 be home for
thanksgiving For real this time
Finally got the whole shebang up n’
running down here All systems
installed okay

His coffee has gone cold but he swigs another mouthful
expression darkening as he notices the blinking light in
Schneider’s in-box

BARLOWE (CONTD )
Picked out something for Josie on
i-mart but don’t go telling her
(MORE )

( )

BARLOWE (CONTD)

L’il birthday offering from me and
the rough riders here in South Tex
Honest to God teddy-bear like the one
on that show she watches all the
time Vintage fuckin’ Americana
Youll love it Or she’1l love it

The line goes dead as the voice mail runs out of memory

BARLOWE (CONTD)
Or something

The maimed ant lies twitching on his desktop legs
working furiously

BARLOWE (CONTD)
This is a sterile environment
fucker

He crushes the bug with the tip of his pen before
crossing to Schneider’s console clutching his Dixie cup
like a talisman

SCHNEIDER
Software’s fucked up dude
Refusing to engage target

BARLOWE
There’s nothing wrong with the
fuckin’ software You’re the one who
always comes in here fucked up

Schneider pushes back his chair to allow Barlowe access

SCHNEIDER
Won’t let me switch to manual
Keeps overriding the override

BARLOWE
That’s ridiculous It can’t do that

SCHNEIDER
Just did Gonna have to haul ‘er in
and look under the bonnet dude
Thing like this could turn nasty

BARLOWE
Maybe the target was too cold to
read Probably still wet

SCHNEIDER
I mean you’ve read Asimov right
RUDNICK
Probably a kid
SCHNEIDER

Either that or a midget Didn’t look
much bigger than a fuckin’
jackrabbit

( ) 2

BARLOWE
The hell do people want to bring kids
into the zone for

SCHNEIDER
Hey sometimes the bambinos are more
dangerous than the parents I heard
Davalos’s boys train ‘em up for
suicide jobs They can’t tell the
difference between right and wrong
like the rest of us

Balowe shakes his head

BARLOWE
How was it for you Kiara

RUDNICK
Piece of cake Like shooting fish in
a bucket I think we got three of
them Hard to tell when the heat
shapes are bunched up like that

SCHNEIDER
What about the kid

BARLOWE
Scramble an EVA crew And have ‘em
send out for more coffee

Schneider switches on his headset radioing in the
child’s co-ordinates

EXTERIOR NIGHT THE ZONE 3
Carla watches as a star falls to earth

SCHNEIDER (V0)
This is Prairie Dawn Omega calling
Charlie Lima Tracking target at
0933238

EVA OFFICERSGTTRIGG (VO)
Roger Prairie Dawn
We have eyeball contact

A searchlight finds her and beyond the beam she sees
something moving an armoured stealth craft coming in low
to hover a few feet above the desert floor rotors
kicking up the dust tiled hull almost indistinguishable
against the darkness Carla squints into the downdraft as
a lighted hatchway opens to disgorge a phalanx of
uniformed figures in blast helmets and kevlar exo-
skeletons The EVA(Extra-Vehicular Activity) crew’s
gleaming night viewing goggles and snub nosed respirators
lend them an oddly bestial quality

CARLA
Oh Dios dador de todo bien
( )
3

A hand swathed in latex grips her shoulder and the child
begins to struggle kicking and bucking Then one of the
faceless men slides a hypodermic needle into Carla’s neck
and the strength goes out of her The last thing she
hears is a strange high pitched chattering as the EVA
Officer bends closer running a geiger counter over her
blackened blood streaked hair

INTERIOR DAWN OP CENTRE 4

Barlowe hovers behind Private Rudnick’s station watching
her work a fresh cup steaming in his hand

BARLOWE
I love this bit If you haven’t seen
this before you’re in for a treat

He gives her shoulder an affectionate squeeze

SCHNEIDER
Sunrise in fifteen seconds

EXTERIOR FIRST LIGHT THE ZONE 5

A steel claw flexes rising from the dust first one and
then another and another the dune-scape quivering with
motion as a platoon of drone soldiers dig themselves from
the shallow trenches in which they have lain hidden
turning as one towards the east micro-filament feelers
whirring and twitching in the pre-dawn air

A band of orange light appears along the horizon

INTERIOR DAWN THE OP CENTRE 6

One by one the monitors lock onto the same image
The disc of the rising sun viewed at once through a
dozen remote infra-red sensors

RUDNICK
Why do they do that

BARLOWE
Desert’s cold before dawn The sun’s
the only thing they can lock on to
Theyd kill it if they could
It’s the closest they get to knowing
god

EXTERIOR DAWN THE ZONE 7
An eerie mechanical wailing rises from the Mark 13
stormtrooperstheir pincers reaching towards the light

Through their artificial eyes the sun’s corona is
dazzlingly ecstatically bright

( )
7

In our ears we hear the throbbing of an engine ominously
off balance revving up and up and up

Main Title “GROUND ZERO”

CUT TO

EXTERIOR DAWN SPACE 8

The USS “Mayflower” a wedge shaped X-33 registered to
the TRANSAT Corporation hangs in geostationery orbit high
above the Pacific rim cargo doors open as a crew member
Manoeuvres a communication satellite into place

A crack of white light widens above the curve of the
earth

INTERIOR DAWN USS “MAYFLOWER” 9

The first rays of the rising sun stream through the cabin
window falling like a blessing on the face of one of
the flight technicians a gaunt unshaven figure in his
late thirties sallow skin and bloodshot eyes displaying
the physical stigmata of too many wasted off-world years

SHADES
God

Shades pops the lid from a bottle of pills sending a
capsule spinning towards his lips as his i-pod changes
tracks launching into a thrash and burn snuff metal
single There is a hiss of static and the pilot’s face
appears on a monitor to the right of his head

COOPER
Shades will you turn that crap down
and close the cargo bay doors
already

Shades dry swallows flipping his trademark glasses into
place shielding his watery eyes from the glare

SHADES
The hell d’you want to go home for
Earth sucks

COOPER
What goes up must come down man
Got a message from Commander Schweik
Says he wants to see you in
debriefing

SHADES
So I havent done anything

COOPER
Maybe they’re gonna replace you with
a machine

( )

9

SHADES
How d’you know I haven’t been
replaced already

There is a burst of feedback and he winces turning down
his headset

RADIO (VO)
This is mission control We are one
minute away from de-orbit ignition

EXTERIOR DAWN SPACE 10
The spacecraft shudders as it’s boosters flare into life

RADIO
You are now passing over Queensland
Australia Landing is expected at
the Hillary Roddam Clinton Space
Centre at about 710am Central Time
Weather in the area is reported to be
good Skies clear No cross winds

INTERIOR DAWN USS”MAYFLOWER” 11

Shades is on auto-pilot mechanically pressing sequences
of buttons the voices of mission control and the other
astronauts running through his head like some tremendous
music He is at home here Part of the machine

SHADES
Fourtwofivefivefive
fourthreethreetwoone

The drugs kick in the cabin walls stretching around him
like silly putty He hits the wrong button getting his
sequence in a tangle but no-one notices He wipes his
forehead trying to straighten up before restarting the
count down

There is a dull pain in his left side and when he raises
his hand to feel for his heartbeat he finds his
fingertips almost completely numb

INTERIOR DAWN THE COCKPIT 12

Space junk rattles off the craft’s hull as it dips out of
orbit a dead Labrador probably jettisoned experimental
debris bouncing across the windscreen

Cooper eases back the joy stick as earth swims up towards
them snuff metal ringing in his ears

EXTERIOR DAWN THE RUNWAY

A sonic boom ripples through the morning sky as the tail
and leading edge of the “Mayflower’s” wings break the
sound barrier A second later the craft touches down
gliding like a bird of prey through the heat haze

SHADES (VO)

It’s the same every time The minute

I’m back on earth I start wishing I
was out in space again

INTERIOR DAY DEBRIEFING ROOM

Shades has his back to Commander Schweik watching as an
X-33 taxis into position on the runway The Commander
sits with his ass propped against an ancient steel desk
the only item of furniture too heavy not to have already
been stolen or requisitioned by another department

SHADES
Of course there’s a kind of euphoria
when you touch down but it’s
bittersweet The moment the engines
cut off you realise the big
experience is over and you’re a
hostage to gravity again like
everyone else

Schweik is only a few years older than him and there is a
baffled world weary look about the personnel officer

that Shades mistakes for sympathy

COMMANDER SCHWEIK
Says on your manifest you haven’t
taken shore leave in over a year In
fact in the last seven years youve
only taken twelve days in toto

SHADES
So I prefer being in orbit
It’s cleaner Besides I’m a good
chip monkey aren’t I

Schweik lowers his eyes teasing a smudgy document from

the maw of a malfunctioning printer unit

COMMANDER SCHWEIK
The best but lately your in-suit
telemetry’s been telling a tale of
woe You’ve got anaemia arythmia
heart palpitations the whole bit

SHADES
Palpitations It says that

He cranes his neck trying to get a look at the printout

( )

14

COMMANDER SCHWEIK
Nobody surfs forever Shades Not in
zero-g Health and safety says so

SHADES
But you don’t know what it’s like out
there

COMMANDER SCHWEIK (CONTD)
Youve gotta have a home someplace

SHADES
There’s the apartment on Southside
but I don’t go there much It’s got
bad plumbing and rats

COMMANDER SCHWEIK
How ‘bout family Got any of them

SHADES
Nope

COMMANDER SCHWEIK
Girl maybe

Shades shakes his head dazedly The white bird of the X-
33 parked out on the runway seems hopelessly distant

COMMANDER SCHWEIK (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s time you found one
I’m putting you on six months paid
leave whether you like it or not

INTERIOR DAY THE LOCKER ROOM 15

Shades shovels his effects into a kit bag Cooper huddles
beside the extractor fan a reefer trailing from his lip

COOPER
Why not go to Antarctica Book
yourself into one of those beach
resorts Heard all the babes go
topless down there

SHADES
I’m just not the Club Arktos type
Coop I mean can you imagine me
playing volleyball

Shades shrugs as the snuff metal track playing in the
background comes to an end the i-jay cutting in as he
peels a photograph of a woman in paint spattered overalls
from his locker door a tousled redhead posed in front of
a jet turbine an oxy-acetyline torch in one hand

COOPER
So You got time to learn Six months
on Earth How bad can that be

EXTERIOR DAY THE CITY 16

A concrete reef of tower blocks rises from a sea of
nicotine coloured smog the wail of sirens drifting up
from the streets below

ANGRY BOB (0S)

This is Angry Bob on Station WAR
Comin’ at you with the good news and
the bad news

INTERIOR DAY GRAND UNION STATION 17

A stone angel stares out over the tide of humanity
streaming through the flume-like concourse sightless
eyes turned towards an electronic notice board displaying
a hundred destinations all across America

ANGRY BOB
Holiday traffic is stacking up over
the CBD and all outlying areas but if
all you guys in the cockpits just
stay cool and stick to your
registered flightpaths Aerospace
Control promise to get you home in
time for thanksgiving And as for the
good news Well whadd’ya know
There is still no fuckin’ good news

An avalanche of sound rages out of a blastbox propped in
the ticket office window nearly drowning out the
itinerant preacher addressing the winding queue

The preacher’s collar is frayed and there is a bandage
around his right hand which seems dirtier each time he
gestures with it which is often

PREACHER
There will be wars and rumours of
wars The masses will go hungry
their bellies bloat for these are the
birth pains the beginning of the
SOrrows

Shades listens disinterestedly Most of his fellow
travellers are migrant workers but the tall thin lipped
individual behind him is some sort of war veteran his
scarred hands thrust into the pockets of a ragged
greatcoat a tangle of lucky charms glinting at his
throat

PREACHER (CONTD)
Woe unto them who are with child in
those times and pray that your flight
be not in winter

( )

17

Shades raps on the glass trying to focus the man behind
the counter who is either too stoned to care or just
naturally insane and off on some strange trip of his own
nodding dazedly in time to the pulsing music

SHADES
I’m trying to get to a place named
Splendora Splendora Texas

CLERK
Youre gonna need clearance for that
area

Shades presses his plastic to the bulletproof window
The clerk nods picking up a rubber stamp and breathing
on it before making an invisible mark on the glass

PREACHER
No flesh shall be spared save that of
the elect for they shall see him
coming the son of man and he shall
send his angels to earth on a mission
to gather together his flock

Shades pushes past the aging preacher eyes going to the

electronic clock its dial flanked by huge plasma screens
bearing the grinning face of President Milton warming up
the electorate for the coming primaries

PREACHER (CONT’D)
The book of Mark Sir
Chapter thirteen

The clock’s hands lurch forward as Shades picks his way
through the vandalized ticket barrier He doesn’t look

back nor does he see the steel tipped boot that comes

from nowhere kicking his legs from under him

TEDDY
Get him Hube Get his fuckin’
ticket

Shades scrabbles to retrieve his glasses Without them he
can barely focus on his attackers or the blurred figures
of the other travellers who hurry by uncaring

PREACHER (VO)
You are like stones All of you
And you will be cast down like stones
into a lake of fire

The burlier of the two youths grabs Shades by the collar
of his flight jacket ramming him up against a
malfunctioning advertising hoarding as his companion a
scrawny kid with an eightball haircut and septic looking
face tattoos takes charge

TEDDY
ID man Breast pocket

( )

17 17

Shades squirms as Hube reaches into his jacket

HUBE
Fuckin’ Buck Rogers man Who knew

He tosses the card to his beaming companion

TEDDY
See the way he fuckin’ walks
Body language dude You can tell a
spacecase every time

HUBE
Welcome to the 21st century Buck
Got any plastic

SHADES
You guys take Transcard

TEDDY
We’re gonna send you back into orbit
spaceman Where you belong
Ready with the countdown Hube

Hube slides a screwdriver from his pocket

HUBE
Tennine

He pauses trying to remember what comes next

TEDDY
Just do it man Ain’t got all day

HUBE
Seven

Hube starts to bring the screwdriver forward but then
another hand grasps his by the wrist He starts to turn
with a bewildered grunt only to have his nose shattered
by a single clean blow head snapping to one side with a
sharp pop of breaking bone

TEDDY
The fuck

The veteran in the ragged greatcoat is standing before
them face still as a mask

LYLE
What’s your name boy

TEDDY
Teddy

LYLE

How old are you

TEDDY
Fourteen

( )

17 17

The veteran grins touching the bridge of his nose

LYLE
Well let me tell you somethin’
Teddy I’11l be brief See this bone
This here’s your septum It’s pretty
hard but the outer edge of my hand is
like concrete and unless you return
this gent’s property pretty damn
pronto I’m gonna crack your septum in
half real neat so you’1ll never take
a clean breath of air again in your
life savvy

Teddy wordlessly drops Shade’s ID making himself
scarce

SHADES
Jesus

LYLE
Jesus been a long time gone buddy
Can’t count on Him to save your fat
these days

Shades retrieves his glasses polishing them on his
sleeve

LYLE (CONT’D)
How long you been on earth

SHADES
‘Bout five hours

LYLE
Better get yourself grounded fast
pilgrim L’il fucks would’ve cut you
good if I hadn’t come along

He crouches propping up Hube The kid’s head lolls eyes
rolled up to their whites

SHADES
Is he okay

LYLE
He’ll be fine I just tapped him

A streamer of blood slides from Hube’s nose as the
veteran relieves him of his small change and a polythene
baggy filled with blue powder

LYLE (CONT’D)
Want some

SHADES
Uh-uh Shit’ll fry your nerve
endings Vegetable city by the time
youre forty

( ) 17

Lyle shrugs pocketing the baggy

LYLE
That’s cool Not plannin’ on stickin’
around Where you heading

SHADES
West South west Texas New
Mexico I dunno

LYLE
We’re on the same train then

An incoherent announcement booms over the PA system

SHADES
You headed home

LYLE
Hell no Do I look like a redneck
I’m from Moorehead Kentucky Heard
there’s work goin’ in Texas is all
Thought I’d find myself a hippie girl
and learn to grow soy beans They’ve
got all those freaks down there now
call themselves “destructuralists”
Don’t believe in no social structure
beyond the family No laws or taxes
or nothin’ Don’t sound too bad

Armed officers are checking tickets forcing passengers
to place their palms against a glowing scanner

SHADES
The hell do they want our prints for

LYLE
To make sure we don’t come back

The gaunt unshaven veteran steps forward smiling
graciously as he presses his hand to the screen Clearing
the checkpoint they join the mob of migrants scrambling
to board an armoured train that will carry them to new
lives in the zone

EXT TWILIGHT THE LINE SOUTH

Getting out of Illinois is a nightmare The sky is purple
and up ahead a blue aurora has begun to spread across the
horizon Dust falls heavily on the tracks gusting
through the headlights rocks and bits of ice the size of
baseballs clanging against the engine’s armor plating

INTERIOR DAY THE CATTLE CAR 18

Lyle gazes out at the storm through an open ventilation
hatch eyes expressionless as marbles

( )

18

After a while he lies back in his berth not moving
staring at the roof a few feet above his face Beneath
him Shades rests with his kitbag behind his head and a
book on his chest

LYLE
What you readin’

SHADES
This book teaches the pronunciation
of our good neighbours in Spanish
America Thought it might come in
handy

LYLE
Yeah Our good neighbours who the
President and General Buckley want to
drive right into the fuckin’ sea
I was with Buckley at Allamogordo
I saw what was comin’ down

SHADES
Cuanto cuesta la canisa
Cuanto cuesta el vestido

There is a loud clang as a piece of ice strikes the
outside of the car and Lyle glances uneasily at the roof

LYLE
I hate being cooped up in this thing
It’s like those boxes they send your
folks when they can’t find enough of
you for an open casket funeral

Shades shivers

SHADES
Are these trains always so cold

LYLE
Yeah ‘Cept in the summer
This’ll keep you warm

He tosses Shades a battered silver hipflask

SHADES
How come you haven’t asked my name

LYLE
What’s your name

SHADES
My friends call me Shades

LYLE
Hey Shades I’m Lyle Private Lyle
Maddox first class until a few days
ago

SHADES
Pleased to meet you man
( )

18 18

He takes a swig and then begins to cough

SHADES (CONTD)
Jesus what is this

LYLE
Woodgrain Sixty percent proof Kicks
a bit Used to spread boot polish on
our bread back in the Corps to draw
out the hooch Ever try that for
laughs

Shades shakes his head
LYLE (CONTD)

What you goin’ to the zone for
anyhow You don’t look the type

SHADES
I got a friend on a project down in
Splendora

LYLE
Girlfriend

SHADES

Just a friend Used to go out with
one of my buddies

LYLE
Figured it had to be a lady

SHADES
My buddy was in the corps like you
Until he got himself greased

LYLE
What happened then
You make a move on her

SHADES
She didn’t want to know about me
man She took off into the zone
Didn’t write for ten years For a
while I thought she was dead too

LYLE
So what makes you think she wants to
be found

Shades focusses on the postcard he’s using for a
bookmark a tinted photograph of a cactus flower

SHADES
Who knows what she wants
Who knows what anyone really wants

DISSOLVE
THROUGH

White light Then flame

A thermal image of Carla’s face as she turns in the grip
of REM sleep cold sweat registering as turquoise
patches on her three dimensional heatshape

INTERIOR NIGHT THE ROOM
Carla sits up staring into the gloom

CARLA
Papa

She reaches out to turn on the light revealing a
commonplace albeit wholly unfamiliar bedroom There is a
coffee table divan a half filled bookcase and even a
bowl of flowers but something is missing

It takes her a moment to realize what it is

The room has no windows

INTERIOR NIGHT BATHROOM

The fluorescent strip above the mirror is unnaturally
bright Carla’s reflection hovers like a ghost before
her the face of some other child entirely a child grown
old beyond her years

Beneath her reflection deep within the glass something
glimmers an unblinking electronic eye watching her
implacably from the other side of the two-way mirror

INTERIOR NIGHT ISOLATION BAY

Matt Barlowe glances at the screen as Carla urinates
heatshape registering the accompanying temperature loss

DR SIMON
I’m afraid she’s perfectly normal
Nothing wrong with that kid’s thermal
profile If the drone couldn’t lock
on then there’s probably something
wrong with your software

BARLOWE
There’s nothing wrong with my fuckin’
software

The dormant cyborg purrs feedback murmuring through its
telemetry plating peeled from its skull to reveal its
wetware eyes staring helplessly as its creator probes
its brain with the tip of his screwdriver noticing what
look like a tiny scorch mark on one of the chipboards

BARLOWE (CONT )

( )

Carla fetc

Matt shake

Probably some kind of environmental
contamination

DR SIMON
Either that or a virus I dunno
I just do organics

BARLOWE
It’s behaving like a virus That was
the third unit to go down this week
But how did it upload itself without
an interface

hes a glass of water before going back to bed

DR SIMON
Maybe the ‘droid was a soft touch
I mean she’s a cute kid

BARLOWE
Unlock the door
I want to talk to her

DR SIMON
And say what you’re sorry about her
mom and dad

BARLOWE
I never wanted this I never wanted
any of it All I wanted was to make
the big machine work

DR SIMON
What big machine

s his head his heatshape floating in the

disabled cyborg’s crosshairs The drone’s combat systems
may be disabled but it still registers the software

designer’s
and vital

INTERIOR

presence recording and analysing his voice
signs filing the data for future reference

BARLOWE
When I was her age I used to think
there was a machine that ran the
world and if someone could fix it
then maybe the weather would clear
up maybe people would finally have
enough to fuckin’ eat maybe we’d all
get to live happily ever after
Maybe

NIGHT THE ROOM

The door opens with a click and Carla sees a bespectacled
man in a coffee stained shirt standing nervously on the

threshold

a teddy bear under one arm

BARLOWE
How you doin’ kiddo

( )

22

Carla blinks scarcely registering his presence

BARLOWE (CONT’D)
I’m Matt

CARLA
Donde estan mis padres

BARLOWE
Youre in a US iso-facility
I don’t know anything about your
parents

Carla starts to cry and he crouches thrusting the teddy
bear towards her

BARLOWE (CONTD)
Hey Hey it’s alright
Look here’s MrTeddles

The light flickers a tremor running through the walls
Carla whimpers pulling away

BARLOWE (CONTD)
It’s alright Just the storm

CARLA
Que tormenta

BARLOWE
Big storm brewing up out there
Big old thunderheads

CARLA
Como el suefo Like in the dream
BARLOWE
What dream
CARLA
The dream I’m having A big fire ina
dry lake
BARLOWE
There’s nothing to burn in a dry
lake
CARLA

There were people burning The lake
was on fire and they were burning up
It was so bright

BARLOWE
People have dreams all the time It
doesn’t mean anything

Carla closes her eyes hearing the cyborg purring softly
to itself in the dark its machine consciousness caught
in some weird game loop all of its own

( ) 22
CARLA
Then what do they have them for
DISSOLVE
THROUGH
White light Then flame
A firestorm burning between worlds
A dry wind wailing like a chorus of the damned
DISSOLVE

INTERIOR DAWN CATTLE CAR 23

Lyle comes awake in semi-darkness a scream rising from
his lips He reaches out hands meeting a concave
unyielding surface His panic as he lunges from the bunk
is all consuming Shades sits up in the lower berth to
find Lyle already struggling with the carriage doors

SHADES
Lyle Hey man Take it easy
You’re dreaming

Lyle tugs at the bolts grey sweat beading his forehead

LYLE
Can’t fuckin’ breathe

SHADES
Snap out of it buddy War’s over

Bright light falls through the sliding door and Shades
catches his breath as he glimpses a landscape almost as
barren as the moon or Mars a horizon of stubby ruins and
corroded pylons opposing the thunderous coppery sky

LYLE
Looks like it was a a big railhead
back in the twentieth Guess it was
important to someone then

SHADES
Still important to someone now Look

EXTERIOR DAY SPLENDORA 24

Two flatbeds daubed in gaudy psychedelic camouflage have
come to meet the train The long hair and rainbow
coloured clothing of the vehicle’s occupants immediately
identifies them as destructuralists One of their number
a gaunt white Rasta in a patchwork coat is waiting on the
platform leaning on a bitch staff a loud hailer in one
hand His name is Melchizidek

( )

24

People begin to clamber from the boxcars as the train
slows and Lyle throws down his pack swinging himself
after it Shades follows letting Lyle do the talking

MELCHIZIDEK
We’re taking in the soy bean harvest
and need hands in the paddies We
can’t pay cash but you if work like a
horse youll eat like one

LYLE
I did a tour on a hydro project back
in Kentucky

MELCHIZIDEK
Get on

He motions towards the flatbed with his staff

EXTERIOR DAY THE PROJECT 25

The road is lined with wrecked vehicles positioned like
marker stones planted bonnet first into the prairie
ushering the convoy up into the farming project itself
They cross a great water filled dyke passing through
the car-henge and a ring of totem poles strung with
brightly painted banners bearing vaguely Celtic insignia

The project has been constructed around a ruined
twentieth century industrial installation once the hub
of the railhead though now the only network it commands
is a web of irrigation canals and patchwork rice paddies
Most of the buildings are simple mud walled adobe
dwellings but at their centre Shades sees two huge
geodistic green houses and a line of aluminium windmills
A fountain sparkles in a forecourt between the
greenhouses and someone is playing a didgeridoo

LYLE
Will you look at that

A topless girl in her mid-twenties is walking along the
side of the track a sarong tied about her hips a sheath
of corn over one shoulder naked children jibing at her
heels More kids spill from the adobe buildings
something of the formal beatitude of hippie greeting in
their smiles mindless acceptance soul to soul

It bewilders Shades to see such things in faces so

young A deputation of women bearing buckets of water
follow simple cotton clothing dyed in rainbow colours
bright voices a litany of cheerful introduction

A dark haired girl barely out of her teens approaches
them proffering a dripping ladle a freckled child
clinging nervously to her dress

LYLE (CONTD)
And this is

( )

25

SKY
Her name’s Moon Rabbit I’m Sky

The grizzled war veteran takes the ladle drinking deep

SKY (CONTD)
You come a long way

LYLE
Further than you know ma’m

SKY
Lyle I want you to meet Joti Faun
and Aspen Joti this is Lyle

Lyle grins not knowing which hand to take first For a
moment he is in hog heaven He barely notices that Shades
has slipped away making for the project’s machine shop
drawn by the sound of the screeching angle grinder

INTERIOR DAY MACHINE SHOP 26

The cavernous garage is a graveyard for obsolete farming
equipment their skeletal remains hanging everywhere in
the gloom Snuff metal blasts from a radio propped on the
bonnet of a dismembered tractor but even at full volume
it is almost drowned by the song of the angle grinder
wielded by the figure in welding mask and threadbare
overalls who is busy slicing into the vehicle’s axle

Shades steps closer sparks skipping about his feet
watching the mechanic sway to the rhythm wielding the
tool with the ease of a born natural Then she sees him
haloed in the light from the sliding doors and raises her
mask pale eyes widening as she shuts off the power

JILL
Shades

He smiles

SHADES
In the flesh

JILL
My God what are you doing here

SHADES
I’m on vacation Thought I’d drop by
and see how you were getting on
You sent me that postcard remember

He steps closer but the angle grinder comes between them

JILL
Yeah I Guess

( )

SHADES
You’re looking great
I can’t believe how good you look

JILL
You haven’t changed a bit have you

He realizes she’s not going to hug him and his fantasies

crumble and blow away like dust

JILL (CONTD)
And who’s this

He turns to see Lyle silhouetted in the doorway

SHADES
Oh yeah Jill this is Lyle

LYLE
Been hearing a lot about you ma’am

SHADES
Lyle pulled me out of some trouble
back east

The war veteran steps forward to take her hand

JILL
You on vacation too

LYLE
No ma’am I aim to settle

JILL
Well it ain’t Disneyland that’s for
sure But if you’re fixing on putting
down roots you’ve come to the right
place We can use just about all the
help we can get

27 She lays down the mask starting towards the forecourt

JILL (CONTD)
We still got three tractors as well
as the flatbeds Takes all I have to
keep ‘em going

SHADES
Jill’s an artist You should see what
she can do with scrap metal

JILL
Used to do some installation work
back in the smoke mostly interior
decor for the up-towners Not much
call for it around here though

SHADES
I saw the car-henge on the way in

( ) 26

JILL
Yeah that was mine I twisted JC’s
arm into letting me do it I think
the idea amused him

LYLE
Who’s JC

JILL
The guy who got this place going
Built it up from scratch
Youll meet him

SHADES
I can’t wait

JILL
He’s working on new energy sources
new food supplies the whole bit
You want to save the world you gotta
start with the roots with the

basics

SHADES
I’m not sure the world wants to be
saved

JILL

That’s what I used to think but
people can change People can learn
That’s what this place is about

She watches from the doorway as the white Rasta oversees
the billeting of the migrants in their new quarters

JILL (CONTD)
The tall guy’s JC’s second in
command His name’s Melchizidek
He looks a bit rough but he’s an old
softy underneath it all

LYLE
Yeah We met

SHADES
And her

He gestures at a girl with a hardening baby face who
crouches sullenly in the shadows wordlessly draining the
sump oil from a dismembered engine block

JILL
Oh Ginny Yeah I’m trying to show
her the ropes She doesn’t like being
left alone Lost her family in the
Roswell uprising poor baby

Ginny averts her eyes taking refuge in her work
deliberately closing them out

( )

JILL (CONTD)
Weve all lost people
That’s why we’ve come together
This is a family

INTERIOR DAY THE GREENHOUSE

The domes are constructed from a fine web of aluminium
insulated with perspex Inside the air is almost moist
enough to be drink and Shades finds his shirt sticking
uncomfortably to his skin

JILL
The sewage runs through the troughs
to get rid of organics then out to
the fountain and the sand filters to
cleanse and aerate it

She plucks a fat tomato from one of the trellises

JILL (CONTD)
You are what you eat It all starts
with the soil

Shades looks reticent so she passes the glossy hydroponic
vegetable to Lyle

JILL (CONTD)
Our life essence depends on the
essence of the plant which depends on
the soil The earth is a living
organism and the farm a single cell
of that organism the earth in
microcosm

Lyle takes a bite then gags A glistening fire ant
scuttles from a puckered hole in the tomato’s skin

JILL (CONTD)
Oh Christ I’m sorry Those bastards
get into everything They’re the one
thing JC hasn’t figured out

Lyle spits mouth bitter with formic acid

LYLE

There’s but one way to deal with ‘em
A simple way ‘cept it calls for some
chemistry Learned it in Moorhead
You gotta use a slow poison with a
syrup base that way they got time to
carry it down to their nest and you
kill ‘em all Not just two or three

JILL
Yeah ‘Cept it calls for killing and
there’s no killing here
Were pacifists Strictly organic

( )

28

LYLE

That’s beautiful But if you extend
the cosmic brotherhood to include
Bre’r Ant here you’re gonna wind up
mighty hungry If mankind hadn’t
fought the bugs they would’ve taken
this world away from us a long time
ago Still would if we gave ‘em half
a chance

JILL
I suppose killing’s something you
know a lot about

LYLE
I was in the corps I did what I had
to but that’s over now People can
change You said so yourself

JILL
You remind me of someone Someone I
used to know way back In fact you’re
a lot like him ‘cept for one thing

LYLE
What’s that

She turns away shaking her head at the hopelessness of
it all at the futility of trying to put it into words

JILL
He’s dead

EXTERIOR NIGHT THE MARTIALLING YARD 29

Rain ghosts across the tracks as a team of soldiers
unload supplies for the coming campaign A platoon of
cyborgs stands as if drawn up to attention motionless
carapaces cocooned in transparent rain shrouds

The sight of his children lining up to be born only adds
to Barlowe’s nagging sense of paternity He flashes his
ID at the sentries making for the armoured train that
waits at the far end of the yard engines idling

INTERIOR NIGHT DINING CAR 30

Colonel McCarthy opens the door frowning as he notes the
software designer’s bedraggled state

COLONEL MCCARTHY
Youre late Barlowe

The colonel steps aside ushering him into a lavishly
appointed dining car where the main course has already
been served at a long table surrounded by army brass and
some men in civilian clothing whom Barlowe takes to be
either politicians or federal agents

( )

30

A uniformed man with receding flaxen hair and carefully
trimmed moustache sits at the head of the table a glass
in one hand

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Better help yourself Matt Eat n’
run The oysters are particularly
good Flown in fresh from Corpus
Christi I think

BARLOWE
Thanks But I kind of lost my
appetite I could do with a shot
though Red if we’ve got it

The lights flicker as he takes his chair

GENERAL BUCKLEY
I hope you enjoy a good storm
Down here in Texas the storms really
do get sort of Biblical

A girl in a low cut gown serves Barlowe his drink and the
General glances disinterestedly at her cleavage

GENERAL BUCKLEY (CONT’D)
More cognac please Matt I’d like
to introduce you to Senator Paul
Fugate Senator this is Mr Barlowe
the Mark 13 project’s principal
software designer

SENATOR FUGATE
I’ve been hearing a lot about your
work Barlowe All of it good

BARLOWE
Thank you Sir

GENERAL BUCKLEY
I’d also like you to meet Mr Moch
our Guild liaison

Moch a vaguely Slavic looking individual in a grey suit
smiles thinly but does not offer his hand

BARLOWE
I didn’t know the Guild were involved
in this Sir

GENERAL BUCKLEY
We have an area of mutual interest

A sharp clatter of pool balls comes from the next
compartment and Barlowe glances up mistaking it for
gunfire The door at the end of the carriage hangs ajar
allowing a partial view of a tall man with braided hair
bending over a pool table a cue clutched surely in his
knotted hands

( ) 30

Complicated swirling tattoos climb his forearms and as
he glances up Barlowe notices his eyes are a penetrating
cat-like yellow

BARLOWE
Whos that

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Oh himYeahWell you might say
that’s the man who squats behind the
man who works the soft machine Matt

The man with the pale animal eyes meets his gaze and even
at this distance Barlowe is forced to look away

GENERAL BUCKLEY (CONT’D)
The senator and I are concerned about
rumours we’ve been hearing of a
glitch in the Mark 13 software

BARLOWE
In all honesty Sir the rumours are
unfounded

GENERAL BUCKLEY
If you could put the senator’s mind
at ease

BARLOWE
Were bound to have a few teething
problems sir a few growing pains
but the Mark 13’s a tough baby In
theory they’re designed to be self
repairing They were built by
machines so it follows the machine
should be able to repair itself If
there was a glitch it would have
already rectified itself I mean
there’s a lot of variables out there

Buckley guffaws

GENERAL BUCKLEY
A lot of variables indeed Let me
put you in the picture Matt Our
friends here have an issue

SENATOR FUGATE
Just over twenty-four hours ago it
was brought to President Milton’s
attention that an undisclosed amount
of fissionable material may have
fallen into the hands of the
militants

MOCH
Weve no evidence they’ve tried to
arrange it into an explosive

configuration Not yet
(MORE )

( ) 30
MOCH (CONTD)
We’ve got a man on the ground What
youd call a sleeper

GENERAL BUCKLEY
The combat readiness of the Mark 13
makes it possible to neutralise the
situation without endangering a
single enlisted life We could have
it all sewn up in time for the
primaries

SENATOR FUGATE
I don’t have to tell you how much is
riding on your software Mr Barlowe

BARLOWE
I need another drink

GENERAL BUCKLEY
I need to go to full deployment
Every ‘borg weve got up and running
Whadd’ya think

BARLOWE
That doesn’t give me enough time

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Time for what

BARLOWE
To run down that bug you mentioned
Make sure it doesn’t go bad

GENERAL BUCKLEY
So Lose a few and you can always
open ‘em up later It’s not like
they’re flesh and blood soldiers

BARLOWE
I guess

GENERAL BUCKLEY
I need you and the board at Fairisle
to back me on this What do you say
Matt

Barlowe turns towards the dining car windows and the rain
lashed dark beyond

BARLOWE
Why not

The Mexican girl refills his glass

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Gentlemen let me propose a toast
To Matt Barlowe and his brain child
the combat soldier of tomorrow the
Mark 13

( )

And the thunder comes again louder and nearer
lightening flickering as Barlowe returns the toast

NIGHT THE MAR

TIALLING YARD

One of the cyborgs twitches hand spasming as lightning
arcs overhead razor tipped talons slicing through it’s
vinyl cocoon reaching mindlessly out as if trying to

touch the

EXTERIOR

rain

NIGHT THE PROJECT

The wind is rising the moon turning the colour of blood
as the project’s inhabitants line up before a big steel
pot eating utensils in their hands Somewhere close by
somebody begins to pick out a hymn on a guitar

LYL
Want me to grab

Ee
you a plate

SHADES
Thanks but no thanks man

I’m on a diet

He produces a plastic container from his flight jacket
dispensing two capsules dry swallowing as Lyle takes his
place in the queue

JIL

ck with you if that’s

( )

SHADES
I had some of the best times of my
life with you

JILL
And the worst

SHADES
Them too

JILL

Look I’m really glad to see you and
everything but you’ve got to let it
go You’re part of something I don’t
belong to anymore Cities
technology the space programme the
whole frigging system I’m out of it
now and happier for it

SHADES
Maybe we could go to the coast Find
a clean current someplace where you
can still eat the fish

JILL
Get real Shades My life’s here
now I’m not running from it I’ve
got work to do changing people’s
heads changing people like you
before they kill off mother Earth
once and for all

SHADES
And I thought I was the dreamer

JILL
Who’s dreaming We’ve got plans to
retrofit entire cities with solar
technology teach people how to plant
new cash crops

SHADES
Youre kidding yourself Folks ain’t
gonna tear down their city blocks and
start living in fuckin’ greenhouses
Things are just going to go on the
way they’ve always been

JILL
Shades listen I’m thirty-eight
years old I’m single no kids no
house no pension apart from what’s
left from the settlement with the
electronics company I appreciate
your feelings but it’s time for me to
start believing in something

SHADES
Jill

( )

32 32

JILL
No Maybe we can’t change everything
over night but we can get started
When the cities fall down we can put
up something better Even just trying
would be something It would be
something

Ginny comes wandering over passing Jill a tin plate

GINNY
Youre the space jockey aren’t you

SHADES
I’m just a chip monkey
Strictly in-flight maintenance

GINNY
Well aren’t you a little far off
course I mean I heard what you were
saying to Turbo here and it really
got my back up

SHADES
Turbo

Jill smiles and shrugs

GINNY
She told me how things were in the
smoke but times have changed and
youd better change with ‘em either
that or get back to wherever the hell
it is you belong

SHADES
I can’t They won’t have me

The onlookers have started to form a rough circle and the
vibe is turning ugly

GINNY
Youre part of a death system
involved in a death style and we
don’t want it down here space boy
Weve evolved beyond that

Jill reaches out touching her arm
JILL
Take is easy Ginny He didn’t mean

no harm

Ginny inclines her head brushing Jill’s hand with her
lips betraying an uneasy intimacy between them

GINNY
Just let me if he bothers you okay

( ) 32

Shades backs away almost stumbling into Melchizidek who
silently looks on

MELCHIZIDEK

JC wants to have a word with you
SHADES

Nice to be wanted by someone I

guess

He turns following Melchizdek into the night as Lyle
reappears plate in hand

LYLE
Where’s he going

GINNY
Gone to have a word with the
management

LYLE
I hope he mentions the cooking I ate
better than this during the famine

GINNY
You work for your food here Prove
your worth and you’1ll see a
difference in your rations

JILL
The only things absolutely forbidden
are meat and chocolate

LYLE
Don’t you miss ‘em

JILL
Not any more They’re just an
addiction like anything else Ina
few weeks you won’t miss them either

He glances at the meagre portion of rice and greyish soy
beans resting in the middle of his plate

LYLE
I dunno My body’s got a pretty long
memory

In the background a male voice begins to sing along with
the guitar as if crooning a lullaby

VOICE (VO)
I saw the light I saw the light No
more darkness No more night

Shades gathers his jacket against the rising storm
following Melchizidek towards the project’s hub where the
adobe buildings give way to the mottled concrete walls of
the abandoned industrial complex

( ) 32

MELCHIZIDEK
How come you always wear those
glasses You on the run from
something

SHADES
I can take them off if it bothers
you My night vision’s twentytwenty

MELCHIZIDEK
Your business if you want to hide
behind those things Just watch your
step though We’re not insured

SHADES
It’s the light that gives me a
headache

Melchizidek leads him up a ramp towards a sliding door
The portal is open a crack and he sees firelight glinting
within

VOICE
Praise the Lord I found the
light
INTERIOR NIGHT FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT LEVEL ONE 33

The entrance reminds Shades of an airlock cancerous
white tiling overlaid in a riot of psychedelic graffiti
There is a row of disused shower cubicles on their left
and two mop haired children are playing in a mound of
discarded overalls piled beside a blind security console
laughter filling the gloomy ante-chamber Along the top
of the screens sputter a greasy row of votive candles

SHADES
The hell is this place

MELCHIZIDEK
You’re standing on the ground floor
of the Pan-Tex final assembly plant
the reason Splendora existed back in
the twentieth back when they had
electric power and air conditioning
and heavy industry and shit

Shades follows him out onto the shop floor

MELCHIZIDEK (CONT’D)
Now it’s ours

The place reeks of cheap incense and bad acid

The stalled conveyor belts are draped in swathes of tie
dyed cloth and strewn with threadbare cushions turning
them into impromptu pews lining a musty space the size of
an aircraft hanger

( )

33

Gigantic murals flare up in the candle light grey faced
beings with lamp like eyes arrayed like disciples around
a painted Christ who wears the feathered head-dress of a
Mayan cacique

A bearded Roshi crouches at the feet of the messiah hard
at work on a labyrinthine sand painting that covers most
of the available floor space As they watch the last of
the coloured dust runs out between his bony fingers

JC
Mind your step I’ve just finished

Shades delicately negotiates the spiral path strange
soft noises filling the gloom Tinklings and faint bells

JC (CONTD)
Want to get high

The ageing guru plucks a reefer from behind his ear
kindling it with his zippo and in the light of the flame
Shades notices his almost fleshless hands are cruelly
disfigured by psoriasis his greasy hair thinning tuft by
tuft The classic physical stigmata of long term
radiation poisoning

SHADES
Uh-uh I’m high enough man

JC
Melchizidek tells me you’ve come to
take our Jill away Izzat so

SHADES
That’s what I was hoping but it’s not
what she wants

JC
She’s a very beautiful woman
Very headstrong

SHADES
Always was

JC
You love her Or you think you do

SHADES
I dunno What difference does it
make She’1ll never go with me

A figure stirs in the gloom
SKY
Youve got to learn to share
spaceman
He notices the raven haired woman kneeling on a mattress

In the dark he must have walked right past her

( ) 33

SKY (CONTD)
You smokin’ that or nursin’ it

Moon Rabbit is sprawled beside her surrounded by a
confusion of electronic equipment making up the
beginnings of a pa system A copy of “Treasure Island”
lies face down in her lap

SHADES
Sorry Didn’t see you there

SKY
You’re a funny little fucker
JC was telling me about you

SHADES
What do you mean He didn’t even
know I existed half an hour ago

SKY

Oh it’s all part of the plan
SHADES

What plan
SKY

His plan You know God’s plan

SHADES
I don’t think there is one I’ve
orbited round and round this mudball
and I’ve never seen anyone

JC
Youre looking in the wrong place
Try some of this Then talk

The bearded man proffers a hubcap filled with shrivelled
brown buttons Shades takes one sniffing it warily

Sky eases herself up beside him but he does not move
away She is warm firm and comfortable and right now he
is in need of comfort

JC (CONT’D)
It’s good It’s peyote Grows just
south of here It’s because of the
ground you see Sacred ground

SKY
The gringos and ladinos that eat ‘em
go crazy but JC gets through about
a bag a day Don’t you JC

She reaches to take one of the buttons and he catches a
glimpse of Sky’s breasts swelling beneath their halter

SHADES
I dunno I mean what’s with you guys

anyway
( ) 33

He focusses on one of the murals a naked Eve with florid
pubes and preposterous breasts confronting a huge
coiling rattlesnake

JC
Do I look like the devil to you

Shades glances down at the peyote button

JC (CONTD)
Go on Take it

SHADES
I suppose I’ve nothing to lose

He puts the button in his mouth and bites down

JC
The Huichol Indians say that when you
taste peyote you taste yourself

Shades wrinkles his face trying not to gag

JC (CONTD)
Yeah bitter ain’t it
Bitter as sin

Shades tries to relax Sky’s warmth against him

SKY
You horny

SHADES
Just going with the flow

He swallows eyes turning to the ceiling inwardly
cursing himself for being so feckless and disorderly so
much at the mercy of events

SHADES (CONTD)
What’s with the murals

JC
You mean the ascended masters
The great White Brotherhood I mean
not “white” like some fascist shit
“White” as in white light Cosmic
dust-off End of the world as we know
it man

The peyote is working it’s way into Shades His skull
feels like a balloon inflated from within The eyes of
the grey beings in the painting seem to glow as if their
faces are just masks hiding heads that are really eyes
all over

JC (CONTD)
I’ve been waiting for it all my life
For the Kali Yuga to give it up

JC (CONTD)

us to bring it onThe Mayas they

believed the same thing Egyptians

got the same calendar too

SHADES
That’s uh really heavy

JC
Even the end of the world’s gotta get
started someplace Either we
transcend now or go back to the
trenches for another two thousand
years

Shades begins to feel afraid He starts forward hearing
Sky giggle as he falls to his knees trying to bring up
the remains of the peyote button

SKY
Oh man That’s gross

Melchizidek lifts the weakly struggling flight technician
by the scruff of his jacket

JC
I was like you when I first got here
man I’d just gotten out of the pen
and hadn’t eaten in three days
I’d been running all night making
time trying myself out against the
desert to see what I was made of

Melchizidek manhandles Shades towards the service
elevator and Sky closes the cage door giggling as she
reaches into the exposed circuitry to hotwire the system

INTERIOR NIGHT FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT LEVEL TWO 34

Blurred faces stare back at Shades huddled figures
watching the cage’s descent from a labyrinth of
maintenance ducts running between the floors

He hears laughter and the sound of a baby crying

JC
On the third day I met this dude
who’d been there and back Told me
someday a miracle would happen
here

The shaft opens into a subterranean vault lined with
bricks and spread with wire netting soaked in pitch
forming what Shades recognises as a “Faraday cage”
designed to suppress electro-magnetic interference

( )

JC (CONTD)
He wore a preacher’s hat but his eyes
were yeller like a cat’s and when he
said there were a storm comin’ I knew
it were true He said Id find
shelter here so I stayed put and
built it up with my bare hands
That’s how the miracle got started

An eerie luminescence spills across his face as the cage
doors open

JC (CONT’D)
And you were part of that dream too
Right from the beginning I always
knew you’d be coming here spaceman
There’s a harvest coming and we’re
here to do the reaping

Shades reaches out to the shining metallic shape that
rises before him lightly tracing it’s familiar insignia
The star The disc The bar The ballistic missile’s
fuselage is smooth and warm to the touch much as he
imagines a woman’s skin might be

JC (CONT’D)
Together we shall bring about a great
becoming

EXTERIOR DAWN THE ZONE

A forest of mud spires oppose the sky like the spires of
a vast lightless metropolis

ANGRY BOB (VO)
Good morning campers Rise and
Shine This is Angry Bob and I’m here
to wake you up

A steel tipped boot descends from the heavens to strike
at the sleeping city kicking it’s walls to pieces the i-
jay’s voice giving way to a revving snuff track

The boot belongs to Juan Cordero a full blood Mescalero
Apache clad in tattered US army surplice who is kicking
frustratedly at a row of ant hills

SGT CORDERO
Blasted bugs I’m sick of getting bit
by these things

The rest of his unit are seated nearby in a sandbagged
lookout post passing around a reefer and listening to
the radio One of them a kid in a stolen helmet and a
Micky Mouse tee-shirt is playing with a pair of
binoculars idily scanning the horizon Out on the
flatlands the air is rippling like quicksilver

Then something within that haze catches his eye

A wriggling iota in the curtain of heat

( )

35 35

FRITO
There’s someone coming

RAMOS
Gimme that

Ramos has a good ten years on the kid and a full
luxuriant moustache to show for it He snatches the
binoculars from Frito adjusting focus a dark shape
swimming towards him through the mirror glaze coalescing
into a solitary figure in a ragged coat

RAMOS (CONT’D)
Juan Get over here

They scuffle for their guns as the figure approaches to
within hailing distance lowering it’s respirator

SGT CORDERO
Que queres gabacho

NOMAD
Ive come to see sub-commandant
Davalos

FRITO

You got the password
Cordero slaps Frito on the top of his helmet

SGT CORDERO
Callate pendejo There isn’t no
fuckin’ password

FRITO
Quit hitting me

SGT CORDERO
Shit youre such a baby

Frito’s hand goes to the Saturday Night Special tucked
into his jeans

FRITO
I’m not a fucking baby

SGT CORDERO
Okay okay You’re not a baby
Youre a fuckin’ pendejo but not a
baby

He motions to the nomad with his automatic

SGT CORDERO (CONTD)
This way You too pendejo

The Apache leads him around the edge of the advance
position Frito following at a distance gun drawn

( )

44 35

SGT CORDERO (CONT’D)
Got a name

NOMAD
The sub-commandant knows who I am

The main camp is pitched further back amidst a jumble of
volcanic boulders a chaos of tents sleeping bags and
army blankets slung over poles A stolen jetcopter
bearing US markings rests beneath a web of cammo-
netting Beside it a hard bitten Indian woman in a flat
Cuban cap is trying to get six teenage girls to run up to
a line drop prone and fire They have to mime their

rifles and keep giggling The exasperated
instructor offers Cordero a laconic salute but he ignores
her The Apache knows ‘Juanita’ ( a nom de guerre like

the others ) has her eye on him when she isn’t fending
off young Ramos’s advances but right now isn’t the time
for it Pausing outside the largest tent he casts a
sullen murderous glance at his charge before ducking
through the flap

SGT CORDERO
You stay here while I ask or Frito
he’1l shoot your ass

FRITO
That’s right

The boy sizes up the nomad seeing his reflection hanging
inverted in the tall man’s blast goggles the sun coming
up behind him in a bloodstained sky

NOMAD
How old are you

FRITO
Nine

NOMAD

Old enough I guess

The nomad smiles Raising a battered Polaroid camera he
takes the kid’s picture
There is a flash of white light

SGT CORDERO
The boss says to bring him in

INTERIOR DAWN COMMAND TENT 36

The tent is compulsively neat On the rear wall three
prints are pinned at eye level On the left a traditional
Christ with light suntan curly hair and a full beard
while on the right hangs a gaudy depiction of the virgin
of Guadalope Between them and directly behind the Sub-
Commandant’s camp chair is a portrait of Emilio Zapata
arranged as if in a shrine

( )

36

Sub-Commandant Javier Davalos sits with his feet up
reading a paperback copy of ex-president Marcos’s novel
“Quetzalcoatl” a loaded magnum resting on the tabletop
beside him He wears neatly pressed khakis without
insignia moustache trimmed like the wings of a stealth
bomber hair cut short His tan has an undeniably reddish
cast and he has the long nose and high forehead of his
Mayan ancestors

DAVALOS
Didn’t think you were coming
It’s been nine weeks since I sent
that correo

NOMAD
Had trouble getting across the glass
flats The correo didn’t make it

The nomad raises his goggles
His eyes are a vivid yellow flecked with gold

NOMAD (CONTD)
I’ve been running before the storm
all night The Yanquis are serious
this time

DAVALOS
Stand with us if you like and we’ll
meet ‘em head on like we did at
Allamogordo

NOMAD
Time you got out sir Back to old
Mex ‘til the dust settles

DAVALOS
Already been there I promised the
virgin I’d not cross the Rio Grande
again until I washed my boots at
Venice beach

NOMAD
General Nathan Buckley has raised and
deployed a column of Mark 13 cyborgs
He’s gonna eat your boys for
breakfast before moving on to
Splendora for the main course

DAVALOS
I have nothing to fear from him
I’m a patriot not a criminal

NOMAD
In Roswell New Mexico your
irregulars hanged men women and
children Children sir

( ) 36

DAVALOS
When we took Roswell we went to the
Mescalero but not all the Mescalero
came to us The media blew the
incident up out of all proportion
The civilian casualties were no more
than half or two thirds of the
numbers claimed And there were
trials you understand The whole
process took months

NOMAD
You’re a man after my own heart sir
We do the same work you and I

The nomad’s eyes seem to shine in the gloom a low
whirring rising in the Sub-Commandant’s ears

DAVALOS
What work is that

His hand goes to his rosary

NOMAD
I like to think of us as midwives

A spark of static jumps in the nomad’s hair the whirring
swelling to a roar filling the whole spectrum of sound

DAVALOS
Madre dios

There is a chatter of gunfire and the ground shakes
The long shrill scream of an incoming rocket
The nomad raises his Polaroid camera

NOMAD
Midwives in a great becoming

Davalos drops the rosary and dives for his magnum
There is a flash

White light

Davalos staggers buffeted by the impact of another
shell almost a direct hit the tent coming apart in
blazing shreds

Behind him Christ and the virgin rise in flames

EXTERIOR DAWN THE ZONE 37

Frito stands shells shrieking over his head binoculars
trembling in his hands A curtain of dust is rolling
towards him a churning cloud driven up by the marching
war machines their infra-red eyes dancing in the haze
He crosses himself drawing his Saturday Night Special

( )

37

A chain of explosions ripple through the camp the 38
shrieks of the dying and the mutilated falling like

familiar music on the nomad’s ears as he starts towards
Splendora his pack over one shoulder and hell following
steadily at his heels

EXTERIOR DAWN THE PROJECT

The sound of artillery is muted at this distance far off
thunder rolling along the horizon’s rim

Jill stares into the haze tracer fire flickering at the
limits of her vision Then she closes her eyes placing
her palms together at her forehead

JILL
Ommm

She draws out the syllable until it hums sitting cross
legged at the edge of the fire ant’s territory a field
of mud spires rising before her

The far bank of the canal seethes with motion as if the
ants have sensed something in the air this morning

JILL (CONTD)
Mani

She moves her steepled hands to her throat then to the
centre of her chest Lyle watches silently from the shade
of the car-henge surprised to find her here At this
hour most of the migrants are already at work in the
fields and greenhouses

JILL (CONTD)
Padme

Performing a morning ritual of his own Lyle slips a

Geiger counter from his pocket raising the chattering
instrument to the seething sky noticing its needle is
well into the red Then another hand grasps his wrist

GINNY
What are you doing here You should
be at work with the others

LYLE
Background radiation’s about five
times above normal you realize that

He allows her to check the reading

GINNY
Where did you get this

LYLE
Standard issue in the corps
Never know what you’re strolling
through out here

GINNY
Well it doesn’t work for shit
( )

37 37

She taps the screen but the needle refuses to budge

JILL
Hum hrii

Jill makes a motion like two OK signs palms out

LYLE
What’s she doing

GINNY
The mudras you mean Sealing her
light There’s something in the air
this morning The kind of vibe you
get before a storm moves in
Gives me the willies

Another tremor comes rippling out of the south

LYLE
That’s no storm

Jill brings the heels of her hands together before
getting to her feet and dusting off her pants

JILL
What’s that smell

LYLE
Cordite Someone’s catchin’ hell out
there

GINNY
That’s not our problem
We have to tend the garden today
Its our turn to

LYLE
Tomorrow there might not be a garden
Something’s wrong and you know it

Ginny opens her mouth Then she closes it as a figure
emerges from the carhenge lurching towards them

JILL
Shades

The space jockey’s face is grey and streaked with sweat
He stammers grasping at Lyle’s sleeve the sky filling
with the drone of approaching turbines

SHADES

JILL
Oh Christ I told JC not to let
him get into the peyote
God knows what sort of half-life that
shit has

( ) 37

LYLE
Its not the peyote

The Geiger counter is chattering too loudly to be ignored
now He glances up a winged shadow coming in low out of
the sun

JILL
The fuck is happening

Ginny takes her hand as a jetcopter soars over their
heads the pitch of it’s engines dangerously off balance

LYLE
Look like government markings

The craft throttles back as if trying to come in to land
but then it’s motors cut out sending it freefalling
towards the assembly plant It clears the crest of the
dome the tip of one wing glancing the nearest windmill
as it whirls earthward

JILL
Ay chingado

The sight makes Shades lose his balance and he falls to
his knees in the dirt lips working trying in vain to
warn his friends of something too big too absurd too
off the scale to be readily coherent

EXTERIOR DAY RICE PADDY 39

The jetcopter is cooling off turbines still ticking as
Melchizidek approaches the other migrants watching from
a safe distance He tightens his grip on his birch staff
as a pressurised hatch slides open in the hull anda
figure in a reflective helmet clambers out onto the wing

SGTCORDERO
Joder

Cordero pushes back his visor staring at the scythe
bearing mob A kid in a blood stained Micky Mouse tee-
shirt appears in the hatchway behind him flanked by a
militia man with a droopy moustache and an ashen faced
woman in a blackened Cuban cap

SGTCORDERO (CONTD)
Who’s in charge here

MELCHIZIDEK
This is a destructuralist commune
No-one’s in charge

SGT CORDERO

Great A bunch of fuckin’ wackos
Ramos Frito round ‘em up

( )

39

The ten year old levels his Saturday Night Special at
Melchizidek who slowly raises his hands the other
zoneheads dazedly taking their cue from him

INTERIOR DAY THE INFIRMARY 40
Shades lies on a cot a saline drip in his forearm

SKY
I’ve hit him with some vitamins and a
little St John’s wort

LYLE
What he needs is a goddamn doctor

SKY
A doctor would only screw him up
worse than he is already

JILL
Skys a witch She can do anything
with her medicants a doctor could do

Lyle glances at the bottled potions and herbal remedies
lining the shelves Dried rattlesnakes roots and pickled
prairie dog embryos He shakes his head

SKY
I studied at Ohio State and have an
MS in clinical psychology if you
want to know

Shades moans opening his eyes

JILL
Easy now We’ve got you on a drip

SHADES
Jill

He stares dazedly at the needle in his arm

JILL
You should never have come
You weren’t meant to be involved in
any of this

SHADES
Then why did you tell me where you
were

She turns avoiding his eyes

SHADES (CONTD)
I bet JC made you send that card
didn’t he

JILL
What difference does it make

( )

40 40

SHADES
That’s fucking great God’s will or
what He set us up Jill

JILL
And why do you always have to make
such a big deal out of everything

Shades tries to rise but Sky restrains him

SKY
Just chill now okay I’1l give you
something to help you sleep

SHADES
No Not yet

He splutters as she forces a bowl to his lips

LYLE
Youre tripping buddy
It’s gonna be alright

SHADES
No It’s not alright
Don’t you know where we are

He meets the veteran’s gaze and for an eerie instant it
is as if Lyle really does understand Then there is a

metallic click as a figure in combat fatigues appears in
the doorway a snub-nosed infantry rifle in his hands

SHADES (CONTD)
This is ground zero

RAMOS
Everyone out Nice and slow

Sky lowers the bowl raising her hands
SKY
Better do as he says
I think we’re busted

41 EXTERIOR DAY THE PROJECT 41

Shades blinks draping his flight jacket around his
shoulders as they escort him out into the sun

JILL
You sure you can walk

SHADES
Yeah I feel good

But he doesn’t look good His hair sticks out oddly and
his skin seems pale and bloodless

( )

41

GINNY
This is just like fuckin’ Roswell all
over again

The militia are herding the project’s inhabitants into
the forecourt where their leader sits propped up in a
chair liberated from one of the bunkhouses his legs
stretched out before him bound in makeshift splints and
blackened bandages

LYLE
You know who that is

Jill shakes her head

LYLE (CONTD)
That’s Davalos Used to manage a Mac
Donalds franchise back in San
Antonio back when there was still
something like central authority in
this friggin’ state Next thing you
know he’s channelling the spirit of
Zapata and got himself a following
The army’s been trying to peel his
potatoes ever since Roswell and now
it looks like they’ve damn near done
it

Davalos raises one hand weakly swatting at the flies
settling on his charred broken limbs Wounded and on the
run it is obvious even from a distance that the sub-
commandant is starting to lose control of his militia
There are too many guns in the forecourt and just too
many people shouting for it to be good karma

SHADES
Let me handle this

He reaches for his phrase book
Davalos glances up eyes glazed with pain

DAVALOS
Que

SHADES
Buenas tardes senor Donde esta el
campo de golf mas cercano

Davalos’s second in command spins chambering a round

SGT CORDERO
Bajale

Shades gestures at his copy of ‘Spanish Made Simple’

SHADES
No comprendo

( ) 4l

Cordero forces the bewildered space jockey to his knees
levelling the automatic at his head realizing its high
time he set some sort of example around here

LYLE
Cuidada por favor Esta enfermo

SGT CORDERO
Callate

Shades closes his eyes wincing as Ramos fires a warning
shot trying to focus the crowd

DAVALOS
Listen to me This concerns all of
you There’s a column of Mark 13
cyborgs preparing to storm this
project

A murmur of apprehension ripples across the forecourt
Ginny turns to whisper something to JC but Melchizidek
silences her

DAVALOS (CONTD)
If you don’t stand with us they’1l
kill you all of you and your
president will sanction those
killings

Lyle crouches beside Jill touching her hand

LYLE
You okay

She nods closing her fingers around his

GINNY
Go fight your war someplace else
There are women and children here
for fuck’s sake

DAVALOS
This place was already targeted
If our flight computer hadn’t gone
down we’d have been a hundred clicks
away by now There are only six of us
left but if we stand together we can
still make a difference

GINNY
Fuck you I’m not going to be your
human shield I had a family once I
had a husband and little girl and
they were taken away from me and
killed by people like you because
they thought we no longer belonged in
Roswell New Mexico Apaches
Murderers

Jill turns to Lyle
( )

41 4l

LYLE
It’1l be alright
We’re gonna come through

They stare at one another as if seeing each other for the
first time kneeling hand in hand in the dust

JILL
It’s been a long time since I trusted
anybody

LYLE
Trust me now

DAVALOS

Together we can beat them

JC turns wordlessly away and Jill disengages her hand
sensing Ginny’s eyes upon her The entire assembly is
following their guru’s example gathering their children
and turning their backs on the militia

SGT CORDERO
Looks we’ll have to fight this one
alone sir

DAVALOS
At least the ground favours us

He turns his eyes towards the heat risers

DAVALOS (CONTD)
It’s holy ground

SGT CORDERO
What’s that sir

DAVALOS
Holy ground The Anglos stole it
from us with the treaty of San
Jacinto Ten generations it’s been in
their hands and look at it Now their
world’s coming to an end and we’ve
come to pick up the tab

There is a bird turning on one of the thermals heading
someplace else

DAVALOS (CONTD)
It that a hawk

SGT CORDERO
I think it’s a buzzard sir

The sub-commandant sighs the pain coming in waves

DAVALOS
From the air it looks like the outer
dyke encloses three sides of this
place
(MORE ) ( ) 4l
DAVALOS (CONTD)
I think the ends of the horseshoe run
into a creek about half a mile north-
east of here That’1ll be the first
line

Cordero nods slowly

DAVALOS (CONT’D)
They’1l be coming from the south so
we’ll concentrate our effort at that
end The inner dyke is lined with
concrete If we drain it we can use
the fuel tanks to draw a ring of fire
around the hub That’1l be the
second line After that we’ll have to
fall back into the complex itself

SGT CORDERO
I don’t like it If they get us boxed
in were fucked

DAVALOS
Got any better ideas

He glances skyward looking for the buzzard seeing only
light and empty space

SGT CORDERO
Maybe we can figure out what went
wrong with the flight computer and
get that bird back in the air

The Apache nods towards the grounded jetcopter

SGTCORDERO (CONTD)
Fly our asses out of here
Live to fight another day

DAVALOS
Oh Madre

His eyes glaze over

SGT CORDERO
Sir

DAVALOS
The air is that light thing that
moves about my head

The sub-commandant’s head tilts slowly forward as if he
is falling asleep

SGT CORDERO
Mierda

Cordero turns barking a slew of commands

SGT CORDERO (CONTD)
Carlos Juanita To the infirmary
Ramos
( )

Juanita helps lift the sub-commandant’s body from the
chair wordlessly following orders despite the tears in
her eyes

SGT CORDERO (CONTD)
Get some few hands to plant out the
frag mines I want a twelve foot
exclusion zone along that dyke’s
inner rim And round up any weapons
you can find

JILL
We don’t have any weapons godammit

SGT CORDERO
We are not playing games lady
I want to see everything you have
hidden from us The US army didn’t
target this place for nothin’

Ramos takes a closer look at Lyle sizing the veteran up

RAMOS
Know how to plant potatoes Country
Boy

Lyle nods getting to his feet

JILL
We’re not criminals like you guys
We don’t kill people

The Apache gestures at the geodesic dome with his
automatic

SGT CORDERO
What’s in there then

JILL
It’s a fuckin’ greenhouse

SGT CORDERO
I want to see inside

JILL
The hell for

SGT CORDERO
What better place to hide weapons

JILL
Oh Christ Go ahead
Make yourself at home

SGT CORDERO
You come with and you hombre

He waves the gun at Shades who is one of the few
individuals not to have followed JC into the bunkhouse

42 INTERIOR DAY THE GREENHOUSE 42

The Apache pushes open the door and then hesitates
wrinkling his nose

SHADES
I’m with you but these folk don’t
seem to mind the smell of their own
shit All part of living in harmony
with the planet I guess

SGT CORDERO
These folk You are not one of them

JILL
Being part of anything’s not
something he’s good at

SHADES
I’m a flight technician alright
I work for the commercial space
programme Wading around in fuckin’
sewage just never appealed

The Apache pretends not to be bothered by the smell
making a show of poking at the rubbery plants and bending
to check the bracing under the troughs

SGT CORDERO
Think you can get that bird back in
the air

Shades looks at him in confusion

SGT CORDERO (CONTD)
You are a flight technician no

SHADES
It only seats eight people Nine at
a stretch If I could fly it who the
hell would choose the passengers

SGT CORDERO
What does it matter Make it fly and
youll be one of them

SHDES
And let some bambino die in my place
No way man No fuckin’ deal

There is a sharp click as Cordero cocks his automatic

SGT CORDERO
I could kill you right here

SHADES
Think I care

( )

42

Shade’s glasses have misted up from the humidity
He takes them off wiping them on his sleeve

SGT CORDERO
That’s the best deal you’re getting
cabron

JILL
For Christ’s sake Shades stop
crapping around with fate This place
never meant anything to you before

SHADES
No but you do

JILL
If you’ve got the chance to split
then go for it and take these macho
fuckin’ retards with you

SHADES
Not without you
I’m not leaving you here

Jill slaps him through the face

JILL
Don’t you dare use me as a bargaining
counter I’m not negotiable

Cordero blinks swinging his automatic from one to the
other

SGTCORDERO
Mande

JILL
You can shoot me if you want but you
can’t use me I will not be used by
you or him or anyone else

Her voice is high and shrill almost a scream She pushes
the gun to one side and storms out of the greenhouse
taking off at a direction perpendicular to Cordero’s
universe He reholsters his automatic shaking his head

SGT CORDERO
Fuckin’ chicks man I thought the
gender wars were supposed to be over

Shades rubs his jaw still feeling the slap

SHADES
They’re never over dude

EXTERIOR DAY THE PROJECT 43

Frito is standing at the door of the bunkhouse kicking
his heels As Jill approaches he straightens fingering
his Saturday Night Special

JILL
Hola Donde esta Davalos

Something is going on inside and she cranes her neck to
get a better view

JILL (CONTD)
Davalos Donde esta

Frito flaps his hands rattling off a stream of words she
doesn’t understand

JILL (CONTD)
I have important news for him
We can fix his goddamn jetcopter
You guys can go now Comprende
Just get up and

Her voice tails off as the smell of blood hits her then
the sound of it dripping and spattering on the mud floor
within
JILL (CONT’ )
Fuckin’ go

INTERIOR DAY THE INFIRMARY 44

Sky and three junior members of her coven are ringed
around a metal cot One holds a bag of yellowish liquid
with a tube coming out of the bottom

Jill’s stomach heaves

There is a rasping noise and the sound of more blood
hitting the ground It is very quiet around the cot
Then there is yelling that sounds like swearing and more
yelling that sounds like orders

Somebody moans

Juanita turns pushing past Jill She’s lost her cap and
the front of her fatigues are sprayed with blood

The crowd parts and Frito crosses himself as Sky emerges
to stand blinking on the threshold the sub-commandant’s
freshly amputated legs cradled in her arms

INTERIOR DAY THE BUNK HOUSE 45

Jill picks her way dazedly around the people seated on
the floor Ginny and Moon Rabbit are chopping up
vegetables while JC plays one of his songs on a guitar
a halo of marijuana smoke filling the air

( )

45

JC
Are your friends staying for dinner
We were thinking of doing Mexican but
we’ve made up some Avocado sandwiches
to be getting on with

JILL
Just leave me alone alright

She seats herself on a mattress curling into a ball

EXTERIOR DAY THE PROJECT 46

Lyle primes another frag-mine stealing a furtive glance
at the jetcopter The craft has been righted and dug free
of the sludge Shades has the cowling open and is
draining the fuel pump Lyle feels the sentry’s eyes on
him and looks away placing the frag-mine in a shallow
depression scooped in the levee and covering it with
dirt working his way in a crouch around the outer dyke

Shades wipes his hands holding out an oil smeared palm
to his dreadlocked minder

SHADES
I need the key

SGT CORDERO
Why

SHADES
I have to see if it’s gonna run
I ain’t going nowhere
There’s nowhere to go

SGT CORDERO
Quien lleva los panalones spaceman
Holdin’ out for a puta like that

SHADES (CONTD)
And you Tying yourself to a leader
without a leg to stand on

The Apache thinks it over Then he shakes his head
tugging the key from a thong about his neck

SGT CORDERO
Cabron

INTERIOREXTERIOR DAY THE BUNK HOUSE 47

Jill watches from the doorway the wind rising as the day
starts to cool The militia are sandbagging the plant
with sacks of grain collecting fence posts farming
equipment and anything else that can be made into
barricades Ginny appears beside her giving Jill’s arma
squeeze but she pulls away tying back her hair

( )

Ginny turn

GINNY
What are you doin’

JILL
I’m going to help I can’t just sit
around getting off my tits while
everything we’ve worked for goes up
in smoke

s to JC who sits in the shadows behind her

cleaning out his chillum

Sky avoids

JC
She may have a point Machines ain’t
exactly living organisms Making a
stand against them might be futile
but it’s as much in keeping with our
way as anything else

GINNY
If we help them we could be helping
the same people who killed my
family

her eyes gathering up Moon Rabbit feeling

too drained after the ordeal in the infirmary to go
through this right now

GINNY (CONT’D)
If we help them we’re making
ourselves part of it Don’t you see

JC
Were part of it already
It’s all just manifestation

He pats her on the shoulder offering Frito his sandwich

JC (CONTD)
Go on It’s good We’d only have to
throw it away otherwise

Frito samples a mouthful watching as the bearded gringo
rallies his followers leading them out into the mazy
afternoon light to make their half-assed stand

INTERIOR

DAY THE JETCOPTER 48

Shades is lying between the seats head beneath the dash
He slides out one of the chipboards searching for the
break in the circuit that brought the craft down

There is a

SHADES
Ill be damned

carbonised fire ant clinging to the wiring

its body randomly redirecting the current
He scratches it free with his screwdriver cleaning off

the points

with a jet of compressed air
( )

48

Then something catches his eye Turning his head he
notices the butt of a gun wedged beneath the seat

One of the snub-nosed assault rifles carried by Davalos’s
militia He reaches out exhaling softly The gun feels
good in his hands like putting on a really well made suit
for the first time He sits up suddenly queasy

Dry swallowing a handful of pills the in-flight
maintenance man self-medicates to hold off his radiation
sickness praying the pseudoendorphins keep his body
chemistry in check long enough to do what he has to to
see this mess through

SHADES (CONTD)
This is it man
Only chance you’re gonna get

Clipping the rifle onto full auto he opens the hatch

INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE MACHINE SHOP 49

A snuff metal track crashes in jagged waves from the
stereo drowning out the world narrowing Jill’s
attention to the stream of gas whistling from her welding
rod She feels her anger rising from her muladhara chakra
like an animal that has been lying dormant all these
years feeding off her hurt expressing itself now in the
singing flame bending and reforging everything it
touches into the shape of her rage

The track burns itself out and she raises her visor to
admire her handiwork The tractors grin back at her with
shiny teeth metal beasts with gun emplacement eyes
scythe blades sprouting from their flanks The vehicles
seem happier this way as if in her final custom job she
has at last given manifestation to their true inherently
belligerent nature

LYLE
Here’s to it

She turns to notice Lyle standing silently behind her
hip flask glinting in his hand

JILL
I don’t drink

LYLE
It’s just water Fresh spring water
Swear to God

Jill takes the flask raising it to her lips
LYLE (CONTD)
No I don’t I don’t swear to God but
it’1ll help
She feels a little dizzy Laying down the mask she

crosses to the garage door

JILL
Figures Never had you pegged as the
religious type

EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE PROJECT

Shades starts towards the tractor sheds feeling like a
kid playing at cowboys and Indians A figure appears on
the skyline and he flings himself into a ditch crawling
on all fours towards the safety of the corn field The
rifle trembles in his hands as one of the irregulars
Carlos a teenager with a smudgy learner’s moustache
passes within a hundred feet eyes trained in the
opposite direction presenting a pathetically easy
target

The soil between the rows is covered in chaff and Shades
knows each time he takes a step he is killing things
unseen bugs snails and spiders perishing beneath his
boots their delicate webs torn pointlessly asunder as he
works his way deeper into the field still knowing if he
has the strength to kill another man even for love

Then he freezes hearing a familiar voice

LYLE
My old lady was really big on
religion She was crazy y’know
Like certifiable

JILL
So what happened to her

Jill and Lyle emerge from the back of the sheds picking
their way along a parallel row so close Shades can
almost touch them He knows he should draw attention to
himself but seeing them together gives him a knotted-up
feeling inside and he wants to see what happens next

LYLE
My fault I guess She quit going to
church I thought it was her choice
but she always resented it Putting
her soul on the line for me when I
didn’t even believe in the fuckin’
thing Anyway she started hangin’
with the Adventists and ended up
blowin’ some charismatic pastor dude
old enough to be her dad I mean for
Christ’s sake she goes back to
church a god-damned fundamentalist
church to get laid She was
completely schizo but wouldn’t admit
it

Jill pokes him in the stomach

( )

JILL
Don’t sound so wistful
You’re over it now right

LYLE
That’s why I joined the corps
It was an easy way to get over a lot
of things I mean I still believe in
love and all I just can’t see one
man and one woman together forever
Not anymore

JILL
I don’t know what to believe I know
relationships don’t work out by
themselves Love especially
It’s just too god-damned hard

Shades hears someone giggle and working his way to the
edge of the field notices Sky kneeling on the bank of an
irrigation canal washing Moon Rabbit’s hair

It is a scene of weird serenity the heavens aglow with
that eerie orange light so common in this part of the
zone transmuting the water into metal burnishing the
bathers in liquid bronze

Jill drains the flask staring out over the canal and
fallow fields at the anthills marching away to the ends
of the earth and a horizon already lost in the
thunderous coppery haze

JILL (CONTD)
I think if I could pray I’d pray God
would cause the bomb to fall on us
right now

She crosses to the water’s edge reaching for the zipper
of her overalls It’s like watching a car accident
Shades knows it’s going to hurt but can’t stop himself
looking anyway

JILL (CONTD)
On us and on our children and on the
fuckin’ ants and wipe us out So we
could stop needing love and needing
dope and needing each other’s dirty
asses and stupid fucked up riffs

She steps out of her underwear hopping drunkenly on one
leg a pretence of shyness in the way she keeps her back
to Lyle but Shades isn’t buying it

JILL (CONTD)
That’s the answer
The final fuckin’ solution

She dives into the canal streamlined and perfect as a
picture in a magazine

( ) 50

JILL (CONTD)
Come on What are you afraid of

Lyle shucks off his vest revealing a torso criss-crossed
with scar tissue A tattoo on his right bicep reads
“FIGHTING 666TH” A flaming skull with a snake coiling
through it’s sockets bears the motto “DEATH TO LIFE”

He kicks off his trousers diving after her Jill’s arms
encircle him and he holds on to her squeezing until she
thinks she’s going to faint The next thing she knows
she’s half out of the water and on her back just out of
Sky and Moon Rabbit’s view Lyle is kissing her and she
feels the emptiness of the world between her legs

LYLE
And Shades I thought

JILL
Shades is just a little boy

Shades sits down in the corn He makes some noise doing
so but it hardly matters The only thing he can feel
anymore is the tip of his finger on the trigger

JILL CONT’D)
God It’s been so long

Lyle enters her and it’s like getting back a piece of
herself that was missing She holds his face running her
tongue around the inside of his lips hungry for flesh
The stubble of his beard scratches her lips and chin and
his hips grind into her pelvis The little pains make her
even crazier She lunges against him pumping hard
ripples widening across the surface of the canal

There is an almost inaudible whirring and Lyle stiffens

LYLE
Theyre comin’

JILL
I’m cumming

Lyle tries to pull out but she clamps herself around him
The water whitens as a phalanx of Mark 13 cyborgs rise
from the canal like dripping armor plated dinosaurs
heat sensitive eyes focusing on the coupling lovers

filling with the whine of servo-motors and the hiss of

too firmly holding her down

JILL
What are you doing

LYLE
Hang on tight baby
We’re gonna be okay

Her eyes go to the transmitter clenched in his right
hand rage welling inside her

JILL
The fuck are you

She screams raging against him and he strikes her with
the back of his hand splitting her lip

LYLE
The fuck is anyone

She spits a glob of blood and phlegm at him lunging at
his eyes with her nails as Shades struggles to reload

A lucky round penetrates one of the Stormtrooper’s camera
lenses passing through it’s brain to blow a fist sized

scoops up Moon Rabbit trying to make a run for it while
Shades covers her Then a round ricochets off the
chestplate of the nearest drone catching the fleeing
woman in the back and passing like a hot knife through
Sky’s heart driving the life from her in a single blow

She finds Lyle’s eyes and he releases her with a yelp
nails leaving crimson tracks across his cheeks

into the deepest past of the canal

The water bursts about her in a shower of sparks and Jill
kicks her way downward realizing she is not alone in

reaching for her flailing legs as she struggles
helplessly against the current

catching a fleeting glimpse of the drone soldiers
advancing through the whirling ash like a ghastly
nightmare from out of the past A bullet he was always
meant to eat

Jill’s head spins

All she is aware of are varying shades of green
beautifully graduated from light to dark

She goes towards the palest color although it seems to
be to one side of her rather than above seeing the
sun’s corona liquid and transformed Then it explodes in
her face and she struggles gasping to the far bank

EXT THE PROJECT DUSK

Carlos and Cordero are already charging towards the
blazing field when the curtain parts to emit a stumbling
figure wisps of fire rising from its flight jacket

The strength goes out of his legs and Shades crumples at
Cordero’s feet swatting at his hair

Behind him the Stormtroopers appear through the flames a
steel noose tightening around the project’s hub

rising from his lips automatic rifle kicking in his

A sharp pain in Jill’s hand brings her back to full

fire-ant clinging to the soft web of skin between her
thumb and forefinger She sits up with a yelp swatting
at the stinging creature the embankment steaming as a
concentrated burst of microwave energy rakes the spot
where her head was resting only instants earlier

Jill turns eyes meeting the machine’s emotionless gaze
as it comes rushing up the bank towards her steel torso
wobbling on its jointed limbs She franticly scrabbles to
regain her footing hearing a drill whir into life as the
beast gains on her microwaves raking the mud spires

working against its body armor searching methodically

for cracks in its carapace

to its underside body twitching and sparking There is a

lunging around the engine mount to bury its hypodermics
in the driver’s head punching through his skull into the
grey matter within The bearded dirt farmer goes into a

JC flings himself clear as the tractor slams headlong
into the flatbed strewing debris everywhere Within
seconds there is nothing sane or sensible left of either
vehicle the momentum carrying both wrecks forward into
the trench ploughing into the midst of their attackers

Melchizidek pulls the surviving vehicle to a halt
casting about himself with his birch staff as he starts
selflessly to his master’s aid JC tries to get to his
feet only to stumble on the hem of his gown as the

Jill drags herself down a narrow steeply inclined
tunnel head swimming with the accumulated venom from a
thousand tiny incisions It is as if there is a light in

like wind or running water in her ears

The tunnel seems to be partly man made a relic of the

burrowing insects and she feels odd raised geometric
patterns beneath her swollen fingertips ancient
pictoglyphs lining the walls as she approaches the
enclosed wombspace at the heart of the mound

Then she freezes coming face to face with the source of
that light

The queen ant stares mutely back at her with jewel like
eyes a radioactive magna mater feeding on artificially
enriched isotopes brought to her by her eager children
toxic phosphoresence oozing from her bulging abdomen as
she reprocesses the deadliest waste mankind can offer
into something useful extruding her round sticky eggs
into the birth chamber into the care of her attendant
midwives methodically giving birth to a post-nuclear and
decidedly post-human future

Jill casts helplessly about herself realizing what she

judicial authority of the United
States of America you fuckin’
retard

LYLE
Screw the United States Women and
children are dying out there

BARLOWE
I’m with you there man

Buckley snarls lashing out at Barlowe with the flat of
his hand There is a sound of splintering cartilage and
the software designer reels backwards clutching his
face

GENERAL BUCKLEY
You stupid fuckin’ civilian
Don’t you dare dis’ the flag again
You don’t have the right Its you and
all the lying mouse pushing mink
livered cappucino swilling
corporate lackeys like you that have
brought this country to its fuckin’
knees

Barlowe settles into his chair trying to avoid the
General’s eyes blood running through his fingers

GENERAL BUCKLEY (CONT’D)
I hope they hang you
You and all your kind

LYLE
Call off the tin soldiers Nate
I’m losing patience

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Well that’s just the problem
Seems we can’t call them off

LYLE
Don’t fuck with me
( )

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Go on ask this sack of shit
He’1l tell you

He nods disgustedly at the software designer

BARLOWE
Theyre not responding to override
They’1l have to be shut down
manually

Barlowe’s eyes go past Lyle to the rear of the
compartment where Colonel McCarthy is silently edging his
gun from its holster

LYLE
The hell does that mean

BARLOWE
Kill them Kill them before they kill
you Simple enough

McCarthy levels his automatic at the back of Lyle’s head
flipping off the safety

The concussion is so loud in the confined space it makes
the software designer wince

Looking up he catches a fragmentary glimpse of the
Colonel spinning to the floor blood jetting from his
throat and turning he sees Carla standing behind him a
smoking gun clenched in her tiny hands

SCHNEIDER
My piece man She boosted my
frigging piece

BARLOWE
Carla

He meets her eyes A child’s eyes Brimming with tears

CARLA
You killed my parents

The tears save him Her first shot goes wide
ricochetting off a bulkhead and taking out one of the
monitors The few people who haven’t gotten on the floor
already try to duck out of sight

Barlow starts to get up and Carla shoots him in the knee
He sits back down turning grey arterial blood running
in rivulets across the waxy upholstery

Carla steadies herself taking aim at his face

LYLE
He’s not worth it

The gun wavers

LYLE (CONT’D)
C’mon

( )

She lowers the automatic and is suddenly just a little
girl again

LYLE (CONTD)
This place is through

Lyle gets one of Buckley’s arms behind his back twisting
it hard enough to hurt and they start towards the door
Carla bringing up the rear

No one makes the slightest move to stop them

The crack in the doors widens another inch and the
cyborg’s telescopic neck lashes out striking across the
threshold at Cordero and the others

SGT CORDERO

JC steps forward and wresting the automatic from
Carlos’s death grip reaches over Cordero’s shoulder
thrusting the barrel into the Stormtrooper’s eye and
blowing a hole clear through the beast’s skull

JC

EXT NIGHT FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT

The brain-damaged war machine shivers shaking its head
from side to side as it hurls itself against the sealed
portal a high pitched trilling rising from within its
shorting circuitry One by one its cohorts turn towards
the ramp massing around their comrade holding their
main-frames together long enough to bring their cutting
tools to bear on the assembly plant doors

Lyle manhandles the General towards an armoured cruiser

a hundred or so gun-toting marines watching from a
respectful distance

GENERAL BUCKLEY
What in God’s name do you think
you’re going to achieve

LYLE
I’m from Kentucky Sir
I don’t believe in gods

He bundles the General into the passenger seat where
Carla can keep an eye on him Strapping on a pair of
infra-red goggles he guns the engine into life

LYLE (CONT’D)

Senator Fugate watches from the platform as the armoured
cruiser skids out of the lot

SENATOR FUGATE

A figure stands to the left of the Senator a patch of
darkness deeper than the night

NOMAD
It’s all part of the plan

SENATOR FUGATE
What plan

INT NIGHT THE ARMOURED CRUISER

Lyle guns the cruiser up the track a crooked smile
lighting up his face

LYLE
If there’s one thing my Daddy taught
me it’s that there aint no fuckin’
plan ‘cept the one you work out for
yourself

The cruiser’s radio crackles

GENE Identify yourself Checkpoint Tango
Identify yourself

Lyle squints through the laminated glass to see a soldier
with an automatic rifle stepping into the roadway ahead

GENERAL BUCKLEY
And the devil You believe in him
don’t you

LYLE
I’ve seen the commercials

GENE Identify yourself

( )

Lyle hits a switch on the side of the wheel unleashing a
volley of armor piercing rounds and Gene flings himself
down hugging the dirt as the cruiser hurtles past the
night lighting up as his unit return fire

Lyle unclips his handset thumbing the transmit button

LYLE
Sorry ‘bout that man
Brakes are fuckin’ shot

There is no response

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Your Daddy teach you how to drive
too

LYLE
Don’t mock me Nate

Lyle twists the wheel taking the vehicle off the track
and over a dry riverbed weaving in and out of a forest
of mud-spires Carla claps her hands with excitement

LYLE
My daddy knew where he was at
He was a circuit preacher
Used to cross four counties in his
Suzuki Jeep with a box of bibles in
the back and me doin’ all my growin’
up in the passenger seat

The project’s domes are visible on the skyline now the
speeding cruiser circling the outer dyke

LYLE (CONTD)
He tried to whip God into me right
from the top He believed in plans
in the resurrection in the life
eternal in all that crap but when
he died they closed the lid of his
box right down on him just the same

He floors the accelerator and Carla screams as they leave
the ground

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Jesus Christ

LYLE
He can’t hear you That’s what I’m
trying to tell you Sir

The cruiser’s fender clips the edge of the carhenge as it
touches down sending one wreck tumbling into another
like a row of dominoes

GENERAL BUCKLEY
The fuck are you doing now

Lyle swerves to avoid a flying Buick zig-zagging through

the exclusion zone
( )

LYLE
Trying to remember where I planted
those frag-mines this afternoon

As if on cue a jagged explosion lifts the rear of the
cruiser taking out one tire Lyle curses softly and
without emotion fighting to regain control as the
vehicle slaloms to one side Just then a figure looms up
in the headlights rising from the earth like a spirit
from some Native-American underworld body sculpted from
a living column of glistening ants Carla screams and
Lyle goes instinctively for the firing controls

The shape raises one hand pale green eyes staring at
them through the reinforced glass

EXT NIGHT EXCLUSION ZONE

The cruiser executes a three point turn hatch opening as
it skids to a halt Lyle stumbles from the cabin
staring dumb-foundedly at his lover

Oh baby

She crumples into his arms and he starts to brush the

insects from her with his blanket They fall away with
surprising ease as if they were protecting rather than
attacking her

LYLE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I

Her eyes meet his gazing up through a venefic haze
Lyle hears a gun being cocked and glancing back notices
that Buckley has gotten Carla’s automatic off her and is
levelling it at his face

Schneider grins glancing up from his console
SCHNEIDER

Despite the saline drip and sutured knee things are
beginning to look up for Barlowe
In fact the morphine is really kind of heady

EXT NIGHT EXCLUSION ZONE

Lyle backs away as a whirring automaton unfolds itself
from the dirt looming over the General and his hostage

LYLE
Behind you

Carla screams as Buckley turns brandishing her like a
human shield She manages to get her teeth into his hand
and he releases her as the ‘droid lunges at him

The kid hits the ground running making a break for the
cruiser and Lyle follows gathering Jill in his arms

INT NIGHT OP-CENTRE

Barlowe watches with wry amusement as the General
struggles in his cross-hairs

SCHNEIDER
We don’t have full contact Sir
Just enough to shut them down

BARLOWE
Shut ‘em down The hell would I want
to shut ‘em down for

He watches Buckley run musing on how a human heatshape
is not much bigger than a jackrabbit after all

INT NIGHT THE ARMOURED CRUISER

Lyle guides the armoured cruiser on a zig-zag course
through the exclusion zone trying to gather momentum to
leap the inner dyke Jill opens her eyes staring into
flames She feels changed by the experience in the mound
Belittled Emptier somehow

JILL
I don’t even know your name Do I

They leave the ground leaping through the flames

LYLE
Just call me Lyle It’s good enough

The vehicle bounces as it touches down on the far side of
the trench windscreen exploding about them like
confetti Lyle whoops bracing himself as they hit the
bottom of the ramp the plant’s reinforced doors looming
ahead a host of ‘borgs clustered before them still hard
at work with their cutting tools

Jill throws her arms around the screaming child as the
vehicle collides with the steel cladding crushing the
slow moving stormtroopers into shrapnel driving the
weakened portal from its frame

The cruiser’s momentum carries it through the tiled wall
into JC’s inner sanctum rolling onto its side in the
centre of the disintegrating sand painting

EXT NIGHT THE PROJECT

General Nathan Buckley staggers to a halt at the edge of
dyke backed off as far as he can go Bringing up his
automatic he empties the clip his last few rounds
rattling harmlessly off his assailant’s bodywork

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Okay I’m done Just go ahead and
kill me you fuck

He winces slipping his dogtags between his teeth and
biting down as the drone lollops towards him buzzsaws
spinning Then a volley of armor piercing rounds rip
through the ‘borg’s bodywork and it keels over emitting
a high pitched whimper Buckley blinks seeing the EVA
crew emerging cautiously from the smoke

The acrid smell of gasoline fills the cabin
Jill shakes her head brushing glass from her eyes
vaguely conscious of Carla pulling at her arm

CARLA

Jill manages to get the belt undone gritting her teeth
as she realizes the strap has burned the skin from her
shoulder She pushes Carla forward helping her through
the shattered windscreen before turning to Lyle

His colour is bad and he seems to be barely breathing
left leg caught between the dash and the frame of his
seat As she tries to free him he opens his eyes
bellowing in pain

( )

JILL
Oh grow up It don’t do an old
soldier any good to cringe

He bites his lip dragging at his shattered limb as Jill
claws her way through the remains of the windshield
Then as she turns to help him free there is a whoosh and
a flash of light

LYLE
Baby

JILL
It’s okay Just push

She grasps Lyle beneath his arms struggling half in and
half out of the buckled window the rear of the vehicle
already consumed in flame

JILL (CONTD)
Fuckin’ push

Lyle pops free as the gas tank explodes and she falls
backwards onto the coiling sand painting the wounded
veteran on top of her pinning her down wisps of ash
settling about them like the seeds of a black dandelion

LYLE
Kiss me

He reaches out touching her blackened hair

JILL
Why

LYLE
‘Cause you’re beautiful

There is a shriek of feedback as their lips meet JC’s
distorted voice echoing from the PA system

nothingness

There is another explosion Shrapnel patters into the
colored dust Jill shuts her eyes giving herself over to
the kiss not caring if they are alive or dead

Above the roar of the flames she hears the whir of servo-
motors and Carla’s shrill voice yelling in Spanish

She looks up seeing the child waving franticly from the

door of the service elevator Lyle grimaces as she tries

to get him upright his shattered leg dragging uselessly

in the dust

flickering below

This country was stockpiling more
warheads back then than it could keep
track of It was only a matter of
time before they lost a few

Three serial numbers in a misplaced

plunging them into blackness

dull amber glow

exists up there

LYLE (CONT’D)

The components were manufactured in
at secret locations all over the
country before being brought together
here in the Pan-Tex final assembly

three rolled off the line there was
no central authority left to take
responsibility for the damn things

a concussion grenade explodes in front of him ripping
the doors from the elevator As if in a vision he sees a

piece of shrapnel protruding from the puckured hole in
his chest It looks like part of one of the service

all oxygen has been cut off after vertebrae have ceased
to meet and flesh and muscle no longer connect

Lyle wants to scream but he has no lungs with which to
expel the cry He wishes he could close his eyes but
without a functioning nervous system even that is beyond
him Instead all he can do is watch as they unravel
what’s left of his torso his discarded head resting
forlornly on its crown beside the stalled assembly line
Then to his relief he realizes he has not been forgotten
after all

jerkily towards him Lyle’s endorphin saturated

Private Kiara Rudnick is cooing oddly eyelashes
shrivelling blood and saliva boiling from her cracking

The jetcopter yaws still rising

Jill locks one arm around the strut shrieking as she
cuts at her assailant sparks showering as the whirling
blade bites into reinforced steel

INT DAWN FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT LEVEL TWO

JC glances up as Melchizidek appears behind him
levelling an automatic

MELCHIZIDEK
Don’t do it man Please

EXT DAWN THE PROJECT
Jill screams

It is a cry as long and thin as a vein the last animal
sound of a consciousness stretched beyond limits
tortured beyond reason maddened by pain and fear
becoming one with the shriek of the angle grinder and the
revving turbines

She catches a last glimpse of the Cyborg still mindlessly
clutching her mangled dislocated leg steel death’s head
grinning through the sparks eyes blazing like campfires
on the shores of another world Then an instant later
it is gone wrist separating at the joint the rising sun
glinting on its body armor as it tumbles away from her

EXT DAWN RICE PADDY

Davalos grits his teeth pulling himself through the
muck dragging Cordero behind him the Apache’s body tied
like a ball and chain to his wriggling legless torso

DAVALOS
C’mon get it up we’ve got a war
to fight

There is a great roaring in the brightening sky
Davalos cranes his neck but blood runs in his eyes
An instant later the falling cyborg plunges into the
sludge disintegrating on impact a few feet away from
him Heartened he draws himself forward

DAVALOS ( Cont )
First we’ll take San Antonio then
Houston then the whole of Texas

The sound of turbines diminishes coming in waves like
the ebb and flow of the tide over Pacific sand
Davalos blinks the paddy reconfigured by his failing
mind into a limitless expanse of cool blue water

DAVALOS ( Cont)
Well carry the flag to the ocean and
wash our boots at Venice beach

INT DAWN FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT LEVEL TWO
JC closes his eyes trying to focus

MELCHIZIDEK
We don’t have the right

JC
Weve got to That’s the whole
point Either we transcend now or

MELCHIZIDEK
I love you dude

He shoots JC in the back of the head watching him fall
stiff as a redwood the remote tumbling from his hand

MELCHIZIDEK (CONT’D)
We’1l just have to work it out on the
other side

The white Rasta whispers a prayer as the cyborgs close
in focussing their microwave cannons Then crossing
himself with the automatic he places it in his mouth as
if it were a chillum and pulls the trigger
INT DAWN JETCOPTER

Jill groans letting the angle grinder fall as she eases
herself through the hatch There is no pain now no
pressure only a dull warmth that spreads from what’s
left of her legs into her exhausted shivering body

She knows she’s losing too much blood but no longer has

the strength to do anything about it

She closes her eyes head lolling against the strut not
noticing the fingers of the Cyborg’s severed hand stir as
it relaxes its grip on her ankle and begins to crawl inch

by inch towards her unprotected throat

INT DAWN COCKPIT

Shades struggles to regain control of the craft g-force

pressing like a weight against his heart

The jetcopter bucks starboard motor changing pitch

SHADES

Oh baby Don’t do this to me now

He tries to engage the back-up fingers so numb he hits
the wrong switch turning on the radio instead snuff
metal filling the cockpit Something clatters behind him
and he starts to turn sensing movement but even this

effort is too much for him

SHADES ( Cont )
Just hold together

EXT DAWN THE PROJECT

Out of spite out of pride Davalos forces himself on
dragging the dead Indian through the deepening sewage

DAVALOS

I‘ll be president for life and any
sonofabitch who disagrees we’1l
string up over the beltway so
everyone can see how justice is done
in the new America You will sit at
my right hand in the oval office and
be my vice-president

Cordero’s corpse is unresponsive

DAVALOS ( CONT )
Carlos will take charge of education
and welfare Ramos and Juanita
industry and agriculture
Pepito fisheries

He barely notices the row of army boots that line the

bank of the paddy blocking his path

( )

CPL CARLIN
You think he’s dead

DAVALOS
Frito department of

GENE
No he ain’t dead
He’s moving

There is a sharp click as Trigg cocks his rifle

DAVALOS
Justice

INT DAWN JETCOPTER

The crawling hand crouches on Jill’s chest like a
clockwork spider hypodermics sliding from its fingertips
as it searches for a vein

She sighs too far gone to care

CARLA
Vete a la mierda

The little girl levels her automatic blasting the
twitching hand out of the hatchway Then she begins to
cry and dropping the gun buries her head in Jill’s blood
soaked lap Carla knows she isn’t her mother but right
now any lap will do Jill puts one arm around the
shivering child the rising sun warming her tear streaked
face her long red hair flickering about them like wisps
of fire in the jetstream

INT DAWN COCKPIT

The tiny craft continues to climb as if trying to escape
the earth the space jockey’s hand frozen on the
joystick

SHADES
Hold

He wishes he could see the stars again and for a moment
almost does outlines twinkling through the thinning air
Then something gives way inside all those years off-
world catching up the walls of his heart crumpling like

paper
EXT DAWN THE PROJECT

Gene tightens a pair of plasticuffs around Davlos’s
remaining limbs a symbolic gesture as the Sub-Commandant
plainly isn’t going anywhere

GENERAL BUCKLEY
Just hold it one moment

( )

GENE
Sir

The EVA crew raise their eyes to find two of the
general’s civilian friends have arrived on the scene
Senator Fugate accompanied by a tall man carrying a
battered Polaroid camera

SENATOR FUGATE
Right where you are
That’s perfect

Trigg glances disdainfully at the lens

SGT TRIGG
Just who in hell’s supposed to be
giving the orders around here anyway

NOMAD
Why Didn’t they tell you gentlemen

Gene obligingly places a gun to the Sub-Commandant’s
head the burning greenhouses lighting up the sky as the
man in the long black coat frames them in his
viewfinder It is a perfect picture

NOMAD (CONTD)
You all work for me
INT FINAL ASSEMBLY PLANT LEVEL TWO

Lyle’s severed hand stiffens in the grip of rigor mortis
fingertips brushing the blood spattered remote

EXT DAWN THE PROJECT

There is a flash
Buckley and the Senator start to turn
Then there is nothing

INT DAWN COCKPIT

Shades sighs white light falling as a blessing on his
upturned face

SHADES
God

CARLA
Luz blanco

Both engines stall out at once a haze of blue smoke
filling the cabin as an invisible wave of charged
particles pass through the hull putting paid to the on-
board computer

( )

The only thing still working is the radio a headbanging
top twenty hit lightening the mood as the craft goes into
a terminal spin and they start to fall back towards the
radioactive cauldron below

SHADES
I’m sorry

JILL
It’s okay

She places one hand on his shoulder giving it a squeeze
It is the first time anyone has touched Shades with any
real affection in as long as he can remember and for a
moment he really does feel okay In the end he is little
more than a bundle of charged particles no different to
the seat he is strapped to yet somehow the warmth of her
touch that tiny incremental spark makes all the
difference He closes his eyes as the snuff metal track
burns itself out a smile haunting his paling lips

ANGRY BOB ( 0S )
Hey hey folks Rise and shine
This is America’s favorite the man
with the industrial dick coming at
you on Station WAR

EXT DAWN THE DESERT SKY

A mushroom cloud reaches towards the heavens unfurling
itself like an angry behemoth that has been imprisoned
for centuries in the desert floor Eight miles high and
climbing fast it is an impressive sight albeit not as
impressive as JC might have wished big enough to put
another dent in the world but not to end it

ANGRY BOB (0SCONT )
And I am here to wake you up

The jetcopter tumbles like a reed achieving some degree
of auto-rotation as it falls as if the tiny vessel and
the man woman and child it contains are riding on the
firestorm the shockwave sending them gliding forward
across the morning sky until they are lost from sight in
the blazing spume

ANGRY BOB The radiation count’s way way up
thanks to that little mishap earlier
this morning in the south west

EXT DAWN GROUND ZERO

Nothing remains of the project of the general or his
master only a bat shaped smear on a blackened adobe
wall Nothing human could have survived within that
witch’s cauldron yet there are still signs of movement
amidst the churning dust

ANGRY BOB (0S)
Cessium levels are expected to hit
record highs by lunchtime but don’t
let that put you off your
thanksgiving turkey

Just keep your windows rolled up
stay tuned to this channel and have
yourselves a hot one

The drones wander aimlessly through the radioactive
ash twitching and shivering One by one they stumble
and go off line becoming part of the landscape the
ants beginning their work rebuilding their mounds
recycling the debris back into dirt back into
something useful

ANGRY BOB (VO) (CONTD)
And as for the good news

The wind rises and rain falls out of the smoke

It falls on the ash and on the mounds and on the husks of
drones and men alike and when the skies clear winged ants
hatch from their remains swarming like smoke from the
sockets of their armoured skulls to teem across the face
of the zone filling it with strange new life

ANGRY BOB (VO) (CONTD)
Well whadd’ya expect
A fuckin’ miracle

A green ant perches on the fingertip of one of the fallen
titans drying its gossamer wings

ANGRY BOB (VO) (CONTD)
This is Angry Bob Signing off
