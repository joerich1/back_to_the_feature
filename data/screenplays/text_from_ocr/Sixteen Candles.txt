formed I just thought that turning

the fact that I dont have any tan
left

(with a closing

sigh)

romantically bankrupt her own life is Ginny has long
enjoyed an overabundance of boyfriends She has no
consideration of how Sam might feel

if all you want off her is a piece of
ass Ill do my best to either do it
myself or get somebody bigger than me
