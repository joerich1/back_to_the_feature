FADE IN

We are flying high over an endless white landscape lit
harshly by the sunjagged mountains rise up in the far
distanceAntarctica

The only sound is the wind There is nothing to break the
whiteness for several beats

Slowly we are aware of a black dot in the distance like
a fly on a white sheet But still too far away to
actually see what it is

Moving closer as music softly sets in The suspenseful
heartbeat of Morricone’s haunting score

Flying now even lower we see that the dot is a snow
truck driving carefully slowly In front of it are
smaller dots 5 humans leading the vehicle

The men move in single file and we can see they are
carrying equipment the rhythm of their marching boots
crunching the snow blends with the music a silent walk
to an uncertain destiny

The man leading the pack holds a scientific device it
emits a beeping sound electronic clicking
methodically getting louder

The men appear to be walking towards the source of the
sound following the signal Suddenly they stop they
are at the edge of a crevasse They form a semi-circle
around the leader

The crevasse seems endlessly deep fading into a
blackness The men look down then at each other In each
set of goggles we see the reflection of the others We
sense their excitement their confusion

We slowly descend into the crevasse leaving the men
behind As they recede we go deeper the beeping
sound getting louder and louder something is down
there calling from the darkness

FADE TO BLACK

EXT MCMURDO BASE — DAY

A mote of civilization among the ice wasteland Buildings
of concrete and metal huddle together in a grid of dirt
roads It looks like a construction site

A large C130 approaches to land at the small airport
TITLE CARD MCMURDO BASE

EXT MCMURDO AIRPORT TARMAC — DAY

The landing gear hits ice covered in salt finds rough
traction and the C130 begins to slow

EXT MCMURDO AIRPORT TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER

The C130’s cargo door opens like the maw of a dragon and
PASSENGERS pour out of it These are not your normal air

travelers They’re an eclectic mix of rugged outdoorsmen

and wide-eyed scientists the physically capable and the

mentally adept intermingled

Forklifts approach the plane A large bus-like truck with
massive tires rolls by

The PASSENGERS leaving the plane begin to thin out as a
handful of PILOTS call out their connections

AUSTRALIAN PILOT
Sydney Marine Lab

AMERICAN PILOT
US Meteorology Davis and team

Remaining on the ramp A trio of passengers still without
a pilot Possibly the last group without one

Standing in the front is SANDER HALVORSON Sander is
Barly fifties stern reeks of academia with his valise
and scarf

SANDER
Adam I don’t see our ride

Just behind him is ADAM GOLDMAN wheeling a large
suitcase and hefting an overnight bag Adam is Early
thirties smart thinks he’s smarter

ADAM
He should be here

Last in the trio is KATE LLOYD Kate is Mid-twenties
pretty and bright-eyed She too is burdened with
luggage She reaches out and stops a CARGO HANDLER in
hard hat and eyewear

KATE
We’re looking for the Norwegian
pilot
Cargo Handler shrugs not understanding Sander looks
beyond him notices a Navy office in the distance and
begins toward it with Kate and Adam following

INT US NAVY VXE OFFICES DAY

CLOSE ON The logo of a red-eyed cigarette-smoking
booze-wielding penguin surrounded by the words “Air
Devron Six Puckered Penguins”

Pulling back to reveal it’s a poster-sized image on the
wall of a shack

Seated at the desk against this wall is BRAXTON CARTER
Carter is early 30s rugged no-nonsense Carter works
studiously on something in his hands

Behind Carter his co-pilot DEREK JAMESON reclines at his
desk watching a “Mork and Mindy” rerun that’s been
recorded on a VHS tape

Jameson is African-American well built bored out of
his mind

On the wall near Jameson is a photo of MacReady (a young
Kurt Russell) standing by his Outpost 31 helicopter A
red magic marker has been used to circle his face and a
handwritten note beside him reads Do not accept rides
from this man”

A third man IAN GRIGGS watches with Jameson Griggs is
Of thick Irish stock red hair and beard

Their office space is small and cramped A window looks
out onto the tarmac where a massive SEA KING helicopter
slumbers The Sea King is the RV of helos

JAMESON
(re Mork and Mindy)
Man just watching this guy makes
me tired

GRIGGS
Eh I watch it for the girl

Reveal what Carter has been working on A Rubik’s Cube
Except he’s not trying to solve it properly He’s used a
flathead screwdriver to take it apart and is now
assembling the little cube pieces together

He slaps the last piece in and holds it up Smiles to
himself Turns around and--

The cube is slapped on the desktop near Jameson
CARTER
Done You owe me a beer

JAMESON
No way How

Jameson picks it up in his hand One of the corner pieces
pops out Jameson crooks his head at Carter

CARTER
What

JAMESON
You took it apart

CARTER
So

JAMESON
You cheated

CARTER

I improvised

Sander steps in from outside with Kate and Adam in tow
His hair is lightly dusted with snow

SANDER
Are you the Naval Search and
Rescue team

Carter blinks at Sander then looks at the sign on the
wall It reads “VXE-6 NAVAL SEARCH AND RESCUE”

CARTER
Maybe Who are you

SANDER
Doctor Sander Halvorson The Oslo
Geosciences Division called me
down here It’s imperative we get
to Thule Station

Jameson keeps watching TV Griggs gives the scientists a
subtle glance

CARTER
You folks are doctors

SANDER
I’m a microbiologist from Harvard
This is my science team
CARTER
Well go team But Thulethat’s
ambitious

Kate lets out an exasperated breath Carter notices Kate
notices him noticing and straightens up

KATE
Look it’s been a long trip for us
already and we just need someone
to take us the last little bit

Carter’s gaze travels from Kate to Sander Then he stands
up and points to a map of Antarctica pinned to one wall

CARTER
Maam Your ‘last little bit’ is
across sixteen hundred miles of
absolutely nothing

Carter points to Sander Adam and Kate as he continues

CARTER (CONTD)
You weigh maybe two hundred
(then Adam)
Plus one-seventy seventyfive
(and Kate)
Plus one-twenty Add my crew and
we get a half-ton of weight and
some change

Carter crosses his arms still barreling through the
basics of the task ahead

CARTER (CONTD)
We gotta turn our Sikorsky Sea
King into a flying tanker truck
load it with six hundred gallons
of fuel plus a reserve and that’s
not the hard part

Carter glances out the window at the WINDOCK flapping
near the Sea King

CARTER (CONTD)
The trick is the crosswind which
is four knots right now but
there’s a Herbie coming up the
Alley tonight

Focused back on the three of them
CARTER (CONTD)

So if we get favorable winds we
conserve fuel and reach our
friends in about ten hours
Otherwise we fall out of the sky
twenty clicks from anything man-
made and the cold kills us

(beat)
Now you still want to go

Unnverved by his speech Adam shakes his head “no” But
Sander is out front and nods

SANDER
We’ll take our chances

Carter glances once more at Kate then nods at Sander

CARTER
You got yourself a pilot then

Jameson perks up

JAMESON
Wait what

Carter zips his flight coat Griggs shakes his head

GRIGGS
Shit He zipped up

EXT ANTARCTICA —- EVENING
Following the Sea King flying over barren landscape

Out on the horizon the sun begins to set behind the
snaggletooth-shaped Transantarctic mountains

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Griggs and Adam sit across from each other on bench seats
in the rear compartment of this personnel helo They’re
leaning in to talk over the sound of the rotors

ADAM
-just the transference of matter
you can beam something or someone
from one place to another Like
television signals I bet it’s
feasible in fifty years
GRIGGS
Whatever All I’m saying is it’s
not as awesome as light sabers
ADAM
Oh come on One is a fantasy
weapon that defies physics the
other is transporter technology
GRIGGS
Man I don’t care how it works
Star Wars just looks cooler
Nearby Sander stares out the window Lost in thought
Still very concerned about something His leg bouncing
nervously as he stares Sander checks his watch

Farther up near the cockpit seats Kate leans against
her bench seat resting her eyes

EXT ANTARCTICA - SUNSET

The farther reaches of this frozen land Later

The Sea King whuffs along a flying workhorse

The heartbeat Morricone theme returns

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER CONTINUOUS

The cockpit Carter and Jameson flying All is quiet and
dimly lit in the compartment behind them

Something BUZZES in the cockpit Carter and Jameson
immediately both begin scanning their control panels

CARTER
It’s not fuel

JAMESON
Intake is fine

Carter zeroes in on something The in-dash compass Its
needle swinging wildly

CARTER
The compass

JAMESON
Huh Okay We uh that’s strange

Carter eases back on the stick slowing
CARTER
Let McMurdo know we lost nav

JAMESON
(tapping radio)
McMurdo Tower this is Tuxedo Two
Niner Mac-Town do you copy
Beat Jameson frowns

JAMESON (CONTD)

Carter

CARTER
No signal

JAMESON
I’m getting some weird

interference

Jameson hits a radio-switch and we hear a strange
warbling noise over the hiss of static Neither easily
identifiable as mechanical nor human

JAMESON (CONTD)
Maybe were in a dead zone

CARTER
Not out here

Carter frowns Considers something

He turns back and snaps his fingers at Kate who notices
She dons a headset Carter holds up three fingers She
switches to that channel

KATE
Everything okay

CARTER
Yeah fine Hey what kind of
scientists are you again

KATE
Doctor Halvorson is a
microbiologist Adam is more
marine biology And I’ma
paleontologist

CARTER
Like dinosaurs

KATE
Well their bones
CARTER
Right What exactly are these
Norwegians doing out here

KATE
They’re not all Norwegians But
they’re a geoscience survey team
They found some fossils in the
ice that’s all we know We’re
here to help them identify it

Carter turns back forward Conversation is over He flips
a switch back to Jameson’s channel

JAMESON
What’s the plan boss

CARTER
(beat considering)
Can we eyeball it to Thule
JAMESON
If we get there before dark
Maybe Just a maybe

Carter pushes the stick forward and the Sea King roars

EXT ANTARCTICA - EVENING
The darkness of the mountains then
The twinkle of lights nestled among them

The Sea King banks around on an approach vector

EXT THULE STATION — EVENING

Snow whirls into micro-tornadoes as the Sea King lands
and powers down near the facility

Lights are on but no sign of anyone at the base No one
stepping out An unsettling stillness

NT SEA KING HELICOPTER

Carter and Jameson in the cockpit Staring out the
windshield

JAMESON
Where is anybody

Carter climbs into the rear compartment

CARTER

Listen up Nobody came out to say

hello so Jameson and I are going

in first Griggs Refuel us then

get to work on navigation
Griggs nods
Sander Adam and Kate wait for the Navy men to lead the
way
EXT THULE STATION — MOMENTS LATER
Boots landing on snow
Carter and Jameson move with intent from the Sea King to
the main door of Thule Station noted by the stencil
marking in Norwegian
Sander Adam and Kate follow at a discreet distance

Carter and Jameson stand to either side of the door

Carter knocks Waits No answer
He knocks again Then tries the door

It opens and we FOLLOW them in

INT THULE STATION MOMENTS LATER

Inside the Extreme Cold-weather (ECW) changing room
Heavy winter gear hang on hooks

MUSIC blares loudly from somewhere inside echoing
throughout the space

Carter and Jameson shut the door behind them and Look
around Still no sign of anyone

CARTER
(calling)
Hello
No response They make their way down the hall

The rest of the group stays behind in the ECW Room

Carter passes an open bunk room Beds made Neat and
orderly No sign of anyone

Jameson rounds the corner

More doors down this length of hall
ll

Peering into another room The radio room No one at the
communications desk No sign of people either

Suddenly from the doorway to the kitchen a Norwegian
MAN steps into the hall holding a bowl of cereal close
to his face This is OLAN Barly 30s Clean-shaven

Olan looks up from his cereal spoon poised to shovel
more frosted flakes into his mouth

He and Carter have made eye contact

CARTER (CONTD)
Hey We knocked

In a flash Olan DROPS his cereal bowl and runs as fast
as he can down the hall--

The cereal bowl shatters on the floor milk and cereal
scattering like buckshot-

JAMESON
The fuck

Olan reaches a door near the end and pushes inside--

Then SLAMS the door and we hear something heavy LOCK
into place behind the door

Carter and Jameson trade looks of complete confusion
SHOUTING in Norwegian from the room where Olan went Then
a second VOICE mingles with his also in Norwegian Also
from within the locked room MUSIC cuts off
Carter goes to the door--
It’s marked LAB in large stencils
There is a small portholelike window mounted into it He
can see Olan and LARS (40s bearded focused) another
Norwegian inside
CARTER

Hey hey hey Calm down-- we’re

search and rescue
Lars and Olan glare at Carter and then--

A small metal door slides SHUT over the porthole window

JAMESON
They went toasty

CARTER
Cabin fever

Sander approaches the door now and Carter steps back to
give him room

Sander calls out in Norwegian
Lars asks something back in Norwegian

SANDER
Doctor Sander Halvorson

Lars opens the door and steps out Olan stays in the lab

Kate and Adam join Sander further distancing Carter and
Jameson

Sander and Lars continue to chat in Norwegian

SANDER (CONTD)
(to Carter)
It’s okay they were just spooked

CARTER
Where is the rest of the crew

SANDER )
At the dig site Theyre fine
everyones fine

Sander is visibly relieved They can tell he was more
worried than he had let on

CARTER
Right yeah Look I need to call
in our status to McMurdo--
(at Lars)
Where is your radio room

LARS
Henrik

From another room a third Norwegian steps into the hall
This is HENRIK (lanky tall curly hair) Henrik is
dressed in long underwear with a sleeper’s mask pulled up
on his forehead

HENRIK
Radio is broken

Carter pulls out his screwdriver-- the one he used to
“fix” the Rubik’s Cube

CARTER
Im pretty mechanical

Henrik shrugs and gestures for them to follow

INT THULE STATION MED LAB MOMENTS LATER

Kate stands off to the side

Reverse angle to reveal the others in the room getting
used to each other Lars stays by the door Adam doesn’t
quite know what to do

Olan and Sander exchange words in Norwegian

SANDER
Show me

Olan nods and leads him to another door on the other side
of the Lab One without a window Heavy perhaps metal

Unsure of what else to do Kate and Adam follow INTO
A STORAGE ROOM lower than the Lab

ADAM
What is that

Reveal a large BLOCK OF ICE in the center of the room
Heat lamps dangle over it pointed down at the center
but they haven’t yet been turned on

Something is ingide the ice Some DARK SHAPE

It looks humanoid yet not human Larger Curled up Yet
the hint of a head and arms

Closing in The ice obscures detail The blurry form
encased inside seems misshapen An elongated human

Most certainly NOT a dinosaur
Sander follows Olan down to the ice block

SANDER
Good Still well preserved

Adam and Kate venture down next Adam’s expression Pure
awe and excitement Kate’s suspicion

ADAM
Oh my god It’s incredible

Kate gets closer mesmerized by the form in the ice It
may be nothing more than shape and shadow but it’s still
quite intimidating

SANDER
(to Olan)
Where is Edvard At the site

Kate’s attention shifts from the ice to Sander
Disconcerted

OLAN
Yes

SANDER
Take us there But first-
(in Norwegian)
Turn on the lamps

Olan trades looks with Sander Kate and Adam Then he
reaches for the heat-lamp array and clicks them on

Sander is already in motion back for the door

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER DUSK

Opening on Exposed wiring electronics A panel of
controls and gauges has been pulled off the face of the
cockpit

Jameson and Griggs sit in the pilot and co-pilot seats
Griggs shines a light inside

GRIGGS
I don’t know Doesnt look like
a hardware problem

JAMESON
What about the wiring here

Griggs slaps Jameson’s hand from the exposed panel

GRIGGS
Don’t touch that Look I’m saying
it doesn’t look broken I can’t
fix what isn’t broken

Carter steps in from the back and leans between them

CARTER
Their radio is out too Which is
weird Talk to me about the nav
Is there a workaround

GRIGGS
Maybe

Through the cockpit window
Sander Kate and Adam follow Olan to a garage

GRIGGS (CONTD)
Where are they going

CARTER
Who cares Just keep working on
the nav Jameson you’re with me

Carter and Jameson climb out Carter starts to shut the
cockpit door

GRIGGS
Where are you two going

CARTER
Where it’s warmer Fuckin’
freezing out here

GRIGGS
Thanks a lot you--

OUTSIDE Carter shuts the door just before he can hear
Griggs’ last word “assholes”

All is quiet for a while Then
ADAM

ITouh I’m really having a hard
time processing what we just saw

SANDER
Try living with that image for six
days

Kate’s reaction is just the opposite Coolly to Sander

KATE
You knew And you didn’t tell us

Sander meets her gaze

SANDER
I told you enough to get you here

KATE
Thats no dinosaur Why bring me

SANDER
I needed to be sure And because
I trust you

KATE
Tf you trusted me you should have
told me the truth

SANDER
Noted

ADAM
Hey hey- Kate look at it this
way You’re going to be the most
famous PhD candidate in the
history of science

Were here

Everyone leans forward and stares out the windshield
Through the light snow flurry a vision The same crevasse
as seen in the opening now with a few tents and vehicles
surrounding it

On Sander getting out of the Spryte Olan steps out on
the drivers side

EDVARD Sander

Approaching Sander is EDVARD WOLNER Edvard is mid-
forties avuncular Edvard raises his goggles to see his
friend with bare eyes
i7

Following him is JULIETTE (French early thirties
wearing a heavy coat with the bright logo of the Oslo
Geosciences Academy on it)

The two men embrace warmly A reunion

EDVARD (CONT’D)
(in Norwegian)
You made it

They pull back both smiling broadly

SANDER

(in Norwegian)
Of course of course Wasn’t easy
Had to hitch a ride with the Navy

EDVARD
(Norwegian)
US military

SANDER
(Norwegian)
Don’t worry they will be gone by
the time we get back

EDVARD
(Norwegian)
Did you see it The specimen
Sander smiles and nods

SANDER
You were right to call me

Sander finally notices Juliette
EDVARD

This is Juliette one of the
geologists who found the site

JULIETTE
Edvard speaks highly of you

Sander nods and smiles like he’s saying I know”
Kate and Adam have gotten out and approach from behind
Sander tentative Edvard sees them Out of courtesy he

switches to English

EDVARD
And this is your team

SANDER
Oh-- yes yes Kate Lloyd on loan
from Stanford Paleontology and my
assistant Adam Goldman

EDVARD
The rest of my crew is below right
now We were about to go inside
Sander’s eyes twinkle Adam is first to ask it
ADAM
Inside
INT CREVASSE TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER
A deep blue glow emanates from the ice as the work lights
offer reflection The tunnel levels out as the group
descends using a guide rope to negotiate the steep path
The tunnel widens to a larger ice cave
Everybody stops and holds their breath From their
elevated vantage they can look out across the cavernous
space and see

A METALLIC DISC TWO FOOTBALL FIELDS IN Si4E PARTIALLY
BURIED IN THE ICE

Our crew is speechless This is obviously a space ship
There is no other explanation

Edvard chuckles a bit

EDVARD
Impressive dont you think
SANDER
Oh my god
EDVARD

Let me introduce you to the rest
of the crew

Standing here are three more of Edvards crew Two crews
shaking hands

JONAS Norwegian Holding a large still-photo camera
The team’s documentarian

- LEON Pushing forty German Glasses Tinkering with a
Geiger counter wearing a repelling harness

PEDER Another Norwegian Bodybuilder’s frame very
angular jawline Cigarette stabbed between his lips

Edvard leads the group to a spot where the ice path meets
the surface of the vessel The ship is buried at an
angle having settled awkwardly in the ice pack Edward
steps onto the ship Sanders pauses dramatically before
following The surface of the ship makes a strange
metallic sound with each footfall Walking on the
slanted surface is not easy and the group is careful to
maintain their balance

Kate is taking it all in Ahead she sees a protrusion on
the ship

A round hatch hangs open

Beat as everyone stares at the hatch Sander and Adam are
both awestruck Kate looks a little concerned

EDVARD (CONT’D)
Took us a full week to figure out
how to open it Radios stopped
working the moment we did

Sander asks Edvard in Norwegian

SANDER
(in Norwegian)
Have you been inside

EDVARD
(in Norwegian)
Just to get readings Nominal
trace radiation The G-SAT didn’t
pick up any airborne toxins

Leon tosses some harnesses on the ground at Adam’s feet

On Kate even more concerned Juliette steps close to
Kate and speaks softly

JULIETTE
Your boss asked if we have been
down The answer only once To
test the air inside

Kate is relieved for the translation and the new ally

KATE
And

Juliette straps on a repelling harness and pauses before
answering

JULIETTE
No one has died yet
EXTINT ALIEN SHIP —- NIGHT
On Leon repelling from the hatch into the vessel below
Following him as he lands among two burning signal

flares A box of gear sits on the floor nearby

Leon disconnects and steps away for the next person to
repel Sander steps up Wanting to be the pioneer

Kate steps up last with Jonas helping her use the zip
line to the floor of the ship below

Following Kate down
Inside THE SHIP

Juliette remains up top The team inside now is Jonas
Edvard Leon Sander Adam and Kate

Several of them activate flashlights and shine them to
the edges of the oval-shaped chamber There appear to be

‘no right angles here Everything slopes up and around

like the inside of an’ egg The walls don’t shine like
metal No sign of seams or separate pieces

Edvard speaks But when he does his voice sounds
strange Hollow and washed-out as if the acoustics of
the room were altering it A very slight delay between
their mouth moving and their voice

EDVARD
This is as far as we’ve been

Everyones breath is visible in the crisp air
The place is so quiet so inexplicably silent

Two round tunnels lead off into pitch darkness from this
room Even the flashlights don’t reach very far

Sander moves for the left tunnel

The others follow

NT THULE STATION STORAGE ROOM - THAT MOMENT

The room is quiet save for the sound of the heat lamps
over the block of ice

Rivulets of water snake down the sides of the block

It’s melting faster now

Hold on the ice a moment the vague alien shape frozen
beneath

INT ALTEN SHIP MOMENTS LATER
In the tunnel where it winds its way around a bend

Jonas occasionally takes flash photography inside the
ship The flashes react weirdly in this space as if the
light emitted from the bulb were like ripples of water

JONAS
Does everyone see that

Sander leads the way His beam finds a round portal-like
doorway Circular

Kate’s light finds another across from it Approaching
one It seems like a small room Furnishings molded to
the walls and floor But no personal items No trinkets
or gadgets

Kate crouches down Notices something with the floor

It’s blackened Carbon scoring The damage widens at the
doorway suggesting something shot flame from the hallway
into the small chamber

A pile of ash rests on the floor at the end of the scorch
marks Long since decomposed whatever it was

Jonas bends down near Kate Shines his light on the scene
with hers Nods In a thick Norwegian accent

JONAS (CONTD)
Looks like there was a fire

More carbon scoring on the floor Leading them to the
next room Flashlights all converging on the entry as
they file in

INT ALIEN HIBERNAL CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

As Sander and the others step into this room their faces
go slack with awe Flashlight beams lance out into the
vastness of this chamber

Pulling back to reveal MASSIVE EGG-LIKE PODS hanging
from the ceiling above them The pods resemble enormous
frosted Christmas tree bulbs filled with a long-since
frozen fluid

Pulling back more Revealing ROW AFTER ROW of them
Dozens Hundreds
This room must span the entire diameter of the ship

At the entry Leon cracks a small signal flare and drops
it at his feet

The wind has crept into this room from the exterior
hatch It HOWLS in unnatural tones

In the otherwise tomb-like quiet the group advances past
the hanging pods Shining lights into them trying to get
a glimpse of whats inside

The glass-like surface is too frosted to see in At best
there are hints of SHAPES or SHADOWS inside Frozen

ADAM
Looks like they were collecting
something

ON SANDER who crouches under one pod It’s been
shattered open Debris on the floor

He shines his light up inside

Deep CLAW MARKS have raked through the glass-like walls
in various directions

SANDER
Whatever was in this one got out

Adam turns his attention to the other pods

Jonas’s light reveals more round scorch marks on the
floor nearby

JONAS
More carbon scoring here All over
the place really A mess
On Kate figuring it out in her head
KATE
(sotto)
More like a crime scene

Kate’s flashlight beam follows a wall

More scorch marks and bloated warping on the otherwise
smooth surface of the wall

Adam walks to a pod covered with a layer of frost He
wipes off the frost with his sleeve and aims his
flashlight at the pod It is too milky to see inside He
bends forward leans his forearms on the pod’s surface as
suddenly more snow dust falls on his shoulders

Then a terrifying earsplitting cracking sound like a
ship ramming an iceberg a slow but overwhelming sound
of metal screeching against ice The ship trembles and
shifts No one moves Snow dust falls from everywhere
s the ship sliding

Then just as suddenly the sound stops Everyone remains
perfectly still Was this it Or is there more Adam
carefully raises his hand like saying it wasn’t me
then

EDVARD
I think we should go
INT THULE STATION KITCHEN —- NIGHT
A refrigerator door opens to reveal Scandinavian soda
mysterious food in Tupperware containers and jars of

some unknown fluid topped with tinfoil

Carter reaches in and pulls out a jar Frowning in
apparent disgust

CARTER
Doesn’t anyone here drink beer

JAMESON
I don’t get it What’s in the lab

Carter shrugs Puts the jar back inside
CARTER
Check on Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-

dum again

Jameson moves to the open door Leans out peers around a
corner-—

JAMESON’S POV Henrik and Lars are seated on a sofa right
in front of the door to the Lab

They’re guarding it stoically Henrik looks our way--
ON CARTER curlous

CARTER (CONT’D)
Couch

Jameson steps back in nodding

JAMESON
Couch

Carter shakes his head Behind him a window looks out at
the slumbering Sea King

Suddenly a FIGURE is at the window hitting it with a
BOOM Carter jumps-

GRIGGS
Carter

It’s Griggs Holding a wrench
Carter shouts at him through the glass

CARTER
You fix the compass

Griggs shakes his head
GRIGGS
It’s useless I wanna come back
in can I come back in
CARTER
Figure out a way to fly that bird
then you can come in

Griggs mutters an obscenity flips off Carter and heads
back for the Sea King

Jameson chuckles Carter looks his way

CARTER (CONTD)
You wanna help him

Jameson immediately stops chuckling

A loud repetitive BOOMING from elsewhere in the facility
echoes into the office Carter looks back to see if it’s
Griggs again-- but Griggs is gone

The BOOMING sounds like someone bashing against a door

JAMESON
What the hell are they doing now

The two men go back to the entry and peer out-——

DOWN THE HALL Lars and Henrik are off the couch and
staring at the door

BOOM BOOM

Something massive inside slamming against walls
Breaking things in the lab Then the door SHUDDERS

Lars and Henrik trade looks

CARTER
Whats in there

The Norwegians look back at Jameson and Carter and the
panic on their faces suggests Jameson really doesn’t want
to know the answer to that question
Then A terrible alien SCREECH Bestial Big
Followed by a CRUNCH The banging has suddenly stopped
And then the corrugated metal ROOF reverberates as if
something heavy were crossing it at great speed
Above them- the ceiling SHUDDERS as large DENTS crumple
inward in a dotted line marking the heavy footfall of
the thing overhead as it tears across the roof
JAMESON
(sotto)

You gotta be fucking kidding me
INT THULE STATION MED LAB - MOMENTS LATER
On Lars opening the door to the Lab peering inside
FOLLOWING as he moves to the open storage room door

REVEALING a HOLE in the ceiling here A few errant
snowflakes drift down into the lab

INT SPRYTE CONTINUOUS
Edvard and Sander in the front of one Spryte Kate and

Adam again relegated to the back seat Sander and Edvard
are in the middle of a discussion

EDVARD
This is the only discovery theyil
remember in a thousand years

SANDER
You’1l be known as the man who
discovered it

EDVARD
And you my friend will be the
man who explained it to the world

Sander and Edvard trade smiles

In the back seat Adam bounces excitedly He feels
associated with this discovery Next to him Kate is lost
in thought

Thule Station looms ahead in the headlights And A
FIGURE in full winter gear approaches them waving them
down As he approaches it’s clear It’s CARTER

EXT SPRYTE CONTINUOUS
On Sander stepping out of the Spryte to face Carter
Carter gets in his face

CARTER
I want a fucking explanation

INT THULE STATION STORAGE ROOM MOMENTS LATER

The empty block of ice sits center-stage Everyone stands
around it Some of the Norwegian team is busy in motion --
grabbing flashlights and donning heavier coats

On Carter gesturing at Edvard

CARTER
So let me get this right

Kate stares at the empty ice block And up at the hole in
the ceiling above them

CARTER (0S) (CONTD)
You guys found an alien in the
ice It’s been asleep for who
knows how Long You thawed it out
and it woke up Now it’s running
around outside Is that what
youre telling me

Griggs and Jameson wait near Carter

Edvard lets out a breath

Griggs cracks a smile Sounds like bullshit to him
Sander speaks to the group ignoring Carter

SANDER
The creature has likely been in
some form of hibernation and is
probably disoriented sluggish
and afraid Our first order is
locating it Do not engage it

JAMESON
What exactly are we looking for
I mean How big is it

EDVARD

Henrik Get the dogs

EXT THULE STATION NIGHT

Flashlight beams bouncing over snow Following a set of
tracks along the building The group has split

EXT OTHER SIDE OF THE FACILITY - NIGHT

Kate Adam and COLIN march out from the building
Crunching through snow in the dark Colin is British
around forty quirky The Englishman’s Paul Giamatti

Adam tries to bundle himself up more against the weather
perpetually cold

ADAM
This is ridiculous

COLIN
Par for the course out here if
you ask me

ADAM
What

COLIN
I‘d be careful who to trust out
here You know they didn’t call
your boss right away Edvard and
the other Norwegians kept going
off having closed-door
meetings

ADAM
So What are you saying

Colin stop and shines his light on Adam Adam squints
COLIN
Theyre sitting on a bloody UFO
out there Hell they probably
sabotaged my radio themselves
Loose lips you know
(at Kate)
Hey sweetheart—-
Kate pauses in her searching and wheels on Colin
COLIN (CONT’D)
How about we let someone else find
this thing ah
INT GARAGE SHED - NIGHT

The structure is as big as an oil change facility but
poorly lit and crowded with gear

The two Spryte trucks are parked here One garage roll-
top door still partly open

Henrik enters Alone From somewhere inside the sound of
his dogs BARKING

HENRIK
All right girls

He moves between the two parked Sprytes

Reveal THREE HUSKIES in a kennel near the large dogsleds
They bark and pace nervously

HENRIK (CONT’D)
Shh shh come on now

The dogs settle somewhat at Henrik’s presence He opens
the kennel door-

And the huskies escape fleeing under the roll-top door
HENRIK (CONTD)
Hey
EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

The huskies making a dash across the Thule Station
compound Right for the generator building

ANGLE ON CARTER AND JAMESON at another corner of the
compound They hear the barking through the wind

Turning and pointing their flashlights into the dark in
time to see the huskies enter the generator building--

JAMESON
That can’t be good

Carter and Jameson hurry for the building passing
between two structures as they go--

ANGLE ON KATE’S GROUP trying to zero in on the sound of
the dogs

Kate catches sight of Carter and Jameson passing between
the buildings

Everyone with her sees their determined pace and hurries
to catch up with them

INT GENERATOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shelves of equipment and two massive motorized
generators chugging loudly behind a fence-wall This room
has a small antechamber before entering the room with the
generator gear

The dogs go right for the generator room

Tucked between the two massive generators behind the
fence something moves Curled on the floor
Diminutive Wheezing Hidden in the dark It’s impossible
to see much of it

The dogs enter And the lead husky barks aggressively
The shape in the darkness shrinks down further

The huskies advance to the open fencedoor--

And tentacles LASH OUT whip-fast stabbing the first two
dogs in the throat cutting off their barks-

The third husky turns around to flee but another tentacle
STABS into its hind leg--

The dogs collapse WHINING and twitching-

Carter steps in from outside sweeping with his
flashlight beam--

The light landing on THE HUSKIES as they are dragged
toward the thing in the dark past the fence

CARTER
Son of a

The light beam travels up to the sickly flesh of the
THING against the wall as it RISES from its crouch--

Henrik enters and sees where Jameson’s and Carter’s
lights are pointed--

HENRIK
Not

He moves as if to save the dogs

Kate Sander Peder and Adam arrive behind Carter in
time to see

CARTER
Grab him

Jameson reaches out to snag Henrik by the collar but it’s
too late- Henrik enters the generator enclosure and-—

A tentacle STABS through his chest

Henrik stands rigid at the entry in shock-

Teeth-like prongs flex at the end of the tentacle poking
out his back and then it RETRACTS tearing out a chunk
of Henrik with it

Henrik collapses to the floor

Carter quickly pulls his handgun Peder steps up next to
him with the rifle

Olan shouts panicked

OLAN
Henrik

Carter FIRES through the grating of the fence-wall

The gunshots are deafening in this space Kate and the
others have to hold their ears

FLESH tears in a flash-quick glimpse of the Thing as it’s
shot point—blank but-—

ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as the spent bullets fall by its
feet Passing right through it

SANDER
Stop
31

Dog-Thing grows now standing taller to intimidate--

It’s still too dark to tell how big it is or even what
its true shape is-

JAMESON
The guns don’t do shit

Carter sees a five-gallon FUEL CANISTER at the entry

CARTER
Tip that over

Jameson positions himself and then kicks it over--

Kerosene SPLASHES onto the creature and spills onto the
floor the canister itself falling on one of the dogs

Peder sees it and yells over his shoulder--

PEDER
Get the fire extinguishers

Carter aims his handgun at the fuel on the concrete--

SANDER
Wait NO

BLAM BLAM Sparks on the second shot catch the fuel on
fire The Thing burns-- Screeching a hideous sound-

The dogs WAIL still fused with the creature It curls up
in the corner flames consuming it

Lars and Colin enter carrying extinguishers The two men
choke out the fire

On Kate still staring at the creature Both horrified
yet fascinated

Olan hovers over Henrik’s corpse In shock

OLAN
Henrik

Colin sees it and pulls Olan away

Olan stumbles out of the generator room in shock He
doubles over around the corner and vomits onto the snow

Sander steps forward tentative Crouching to inspect the
nowburned Thing

The monster still burns in one or two spots Unmoving

Sander sneers back at Carter

SANDER
you killed it

CARTER
Youre welcome

One of the generator motors coughs and shuts down

EXT THULE STATION — NIGHT

A bird’s-eye angle on the base

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM - NIGHT
A lot of the group is here Only a few are missing

Among the Norwegians we have Edvard Lars Peder
Juliette and Colin It’s clear that they have been hit
hard by the death of one of their own

Then there is the research team of Sander Kate and
Adam plus Carter

Sander speaks to the group after a tentative silence

SANDER
We are all shocked at what
happened to Henrik I understand
he was friend to many here at the
camp But there are things that
mast be done soon or else we miss
a vital window of opportunity
(beat)
We need to consider an autopsy

JULIETTE
Autopsy You want to cut Henrik
open

SANDER

Not Henrik The creature We need
to know as much about it as we
can to understand why and how
it acted the way it did

CARTER
You don’t need to carve it up to
know why it killed the dog
handler We all saw it

SANDER

You can’t trust what you saw For
all we know the alien was trying
to communicate with Henrik Or it
reacted defensively We must
understand its biology

(to Edvard)
Let me do my job Edvard Its why
you brought me down here

CARTER
Yeah well I gotta do my job now

SANDER
What is that some kind of threat

CARTER
Take it however you want but I am
going back to McMurdo and
reporting this mess You got maybe
three days before your whole camp
is under investigation

(beat)

Henrik’s body goes back too So
say your last words

Carter makes for the door

Sander turns toward Edvard to look for support They see
the writing on the wall with Carter’s return to McMurdo

SANDER
We must examine the creature now
While we still have it in our
possession

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM MOMENTS LATER
Carter enters
Griggs is checking on a pale sweaty Olan near the pool

table Olan breathes shallowly as Griggs holds a
stethoscope to his chest

Jameson absently rolls stripes and solids into pockets
Waiting for Carter’s arrival Soon as he sees Carter

JAMESON
Man what the FUCK was that thing
Did they say

CARTER
They don’t really know
34

JAMESON
Where did it come from

CARTER
Outer space if you believe them
We go up at first light With or
without nav

GRIGGS

I don’t know if we have that long
Carter uh--

(pulls Carter away

from Olan)
This guy needs hospital care He‘’s
got cardiac arrhythmia been in
shock since the attack

Jameson joins in to remind Carter what he’s been telling
Griggs

JAMESON
We can’t lift off in the dark
without a compass

GRIGGS
(to Carter urgently)
He doesn’t have much time If
there’s a chance we can fly

Carter glances over at Olan Olan looks sickly
Jameson shakes his head slowly Don’t do it Carter

CARTER
I’m not risking it Do what you
can to stabilize him for now
Well take him with us at dawn

Griggs looks back to Olan

On Olan panicked Breathing more quickly now

INT THULE STATION MED LAB — NIGHT

Close on A tarp being unveiled to reveal the corpse of
the DOG-THING on the exam table He looks for a way to
approach it Adam stands nearby with a legal pad and pen
ready to annotate Sander’s autopsy

The corpse resembles a pile of charred leather with plate
like segments of sealskin over its torso and head The
dogs are still conjoined and fused to the creature as if
its own arms were leashes One dog is unrecognizable

SANDER
Is this all of it

ADAM
The dogs too Theyre uh
attached Somehow

Kate watches from the other side of the lab Prepping
various surgical tools for Sander to use wearing
surgical gloves herself She glances over at the body

SANDER
Kate join in Take a look at
these fused ligaments between the
husky and the creature The bone
structure is unique

KATE
They’re fused together

She approaches Begins to cautiously examine some exposed
bone on the burnt corpse Kate was Sander’s “canary” as
it were now that she’s touched it he ventures in with
his scalpel

SANDER
Incredible

ADAM
What

SANDER

It seems it wasn’t consuming the
dogs it was absorbing them

Kate exposes more bone from the alien creature

KATE
Sander Look at this

Sander joins Kate

KATE (CONTD)
This is alien bone structure and
over here-- that’s canine But
these here In between Hybrid
Like it was learning what the
huskies were On a genetic level

ADAM
For what purpose

KATE
I don’t know Maybe to copy them
36

SANDER

Or just to better adapt to its new

environment We can’t tell much

from just a corpse
Close on the malformed face of the dog
Kate shakes her head at the sight of it She’s beginning
to get very concerned about something
EXT THULE STATION —- PREDAWN
Peder and Lars carry Henrik’s body in a body-—bag
Carter leads the way for them Opens the rear door to the

Sea King The men carry it inside and set it gently on
the floor by the paramedic gear

NT SEA KING HELICOPTER — CONTINUOUS

Lars takes off his ballcap and holds it at his chest
Tucks his chin down in a quick and silent prayer

Peder sees him doing this and shakes his head but waits
for Lars to finish He readies a cigarette while he
waits slapping the pack in his palm

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

Lars and Peder step out Peder slides the door shut The
two men regard Carter a moment puzzled

Carter looks out at the faint light where the sun will
soon peer over the horizon

It’s nearly time to leave

INT THULE STATION MED LAB — PRE-DAWN
Sander stands at the microscope station Fascinated

Kate keeps focused on the corpse exhausted but awake
Adam transcribes for Sander

Kate notices something on the table and picks up a metal
tray Spent bullets rattle around inside

KATE
Where were these

ADAM
On the floor The bullets had been
regurgitated from the creature
Spit out from its body

SANDER
It rejects inorganic material
Suggesting phenotypic plasticity
Amazing

Adam keeps up with the notepad as best he can Sander
stares back into the microscope

SANDER (CONTD)
The transformative power of this
creature Incredible Down to
its own blood

Kate stares at the blood on her surgical gloves with new
concern She pulls them off and discards them on the exam
table by the creature

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY —- MOMENTS LATER

On Kate stepping out of the Med Lab making her way down
the hall Taking off her aspirator mask

CARTER (0S)
Kate

Carter catches her in the hall She’s startled then
relieved it’s Carter

KATE
Hey

CARTER
Were leaving now But if the
weather holds up I’1l be back
with help in a few days

KATE
Okay Good luck

Carter can’t just let it go at that

CARTER
You understand the Norwegians are
gonna lose control of the whole
lab This place is about to get
very popular

KATE
At this point
(breath)
I think thats the best plan

Beat Carter didn’t expect her to be in agreement

CARTER
I’m talking men with guns
KATE
I know
(beat)
IT can’t go with you Carter I
wish I could but I still have

work to do

Carter sees the worry in her eyes He knows something
more is going on with her something she won’t say

He doesn’t press her

CARTER
Yeah So do I

He turns to go

Kate rubs her hands over her face utterly exhausted

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER —- DAWN
Angle on Henrik’s body bag in the Sea King

Drifting up and over to find Olan still pale and sweaty
In a bench seat nearby

Olan regards the body bag with fear and dread

Griggs sits across from Olan Eyeing him carefully

INT COCKPIT

Carter and Jameson power up the Sea King

Through the windshield Carter sees Edvard step outside
from the main building Edvard stands and watches them

prepare to leave

JAMESON
Rotors at full

CARTER
Lets get out of here

EXT THULE STATION - DAWN

The massive helicopter lifts off

INT THULE STATION RESTROOM — THAT MOMENT

Kate washes her face

She stares at her reflection in the mirror Lack of
sleep stress bearing witness to an alien creature
attack and devour dogs and kill a man all of it shows
on her face She needs sleep

Kate grabs for the hand towel but it slips off its ring
and hits the floor

She bends down to pick it up

Something catches her attention On the floor

Four SHINY METAL BITS Oddly shaped Spotted with blood
Kate picks them up and examines them under the light At
first she doesn’t know what they are Then A look of
recognition Then shock

Staring at her reflection she leans close to the mirror
and opens her mouth

The shape of the metal bits is like her silver FILLINGS
in her mouth These are from someone’s teeth

KATE
Oh god

She turns toward the door of the restroom but something
else catches her eye--

The shower Its curtain pulled close Something spattered
on its inner lining

Slowly Kate approaches the shower curtain
The shadowy form inside is it a stain or a person
A breath then Kate YANKS it open to reveal--—

BLOOD Painted and misted on the inside of the shower

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER

Kate runs full-tilt down the hall boots on wood planks
stomping as she goes--

Juliette peers out of her bunk room as Kate hauls past--—

EXT THULE STATION — THAT MOMENT
The Sea King lifting off Angling up
Edvard stands by the door watching it take off

Kate runs out not fully dressed in cold-weather gear
Immediately she starts waving down the helicopter

KATE
CARTER WATT
INT COCKPIT CONTINUOUS

Carter doesn’t see Kate He pulls up on the stick--

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS
The Sea King begins rotating to bank away from the camp
Kate keeps waving her arms
KATE
Come on
INT COCKPIT CONTINUOUS

Carter’s POV Kate flagging him down She already looks
tiny from a hundred feet up Getting farther away

CARTER
(into headset)
Hang on-- hold up
JAMESON
(in headset)
What what
Carter levels out the Sea King

IN THE REAR COMPARTMENT Griggs speaks into his headset

GRIGGS
Why are we stopping

CARTER She’s flagging us down

On Olan panicked even more than usual

OLAN
What’s going on

NEARBY the wrapped body of Henrik bumps against the
bench seat still in its bodybag

IN THE COCKPIT Carter debates whether or not to land
Looking back down at Kate
EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

On Kate still flagging them down

EDVARD
What is it
KATE
(calling)
CARTER

INT COCKPIT — CONTINUOUS
Carter makes a snap decision
CARTER
Fuck it We‘re landing
(over the speaker)
Griggs we’re taking her back

He jams the stick down and the Sea King tucks its chin
down for a quick descent

IN THE REAR COMPARTMENT Griggs grabs a stirrup to hold
steady as the helicopter drops The sound of the rotors
vibrate the benches and the gear strapped to the wall
EXT THULE STATION - CONTINUOUS

The helicopter arcs back around to land

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

In the rear compartment Griggs takes his headset off

Olan looks confused approaching scared

OLAN
Why are we landing I need to get
to hospital right away yes

Griggs holds his hands up to try and calm Olan

GRIGGS
Its gonna be fine nothing to
worry about

Olan looks back up at Griggs about to form another plea
to the American when his eyes go wide

ON GRIGGS again as a trickle of blood runs down from his
forehead along the bridge of his nose His eyes roll up
into his head His mouth opens

And his head SPLITS IN TWO like his body were unzipping
itself--

TEARING his flightsuit revealing not human organs
beneath but a mass of reddish coiled TBNTACLES--

OLAN starts screaming-

OLAN
HEY HELP BACK HERE

But the sound of the helo drowns out his shouts

Immediately Olan starts tugging at the buckle to his seat
harness fumbling with the straps

ON GRIGGS as the tentacles practically EXPLODE from the
gap between the two separated halves of Griggs’s body--

ENSNARING and STABBING into Olan-

Close on Olans face as the tentacles burrow into his
cheek his eyes mouth and chin--

ANGLE ON the rear compartment where Griggs on one end
still sits braced and the ropes of bloody tentacles
extend across from his body to Olan sitting opposite

Beyond in the cockpit Carter and Jameson are still
focused on landing unaware of the gruesome scene behind
them

The sound in the helo is almost completely muffled and
were now listening in the Sea King headsets hearing
what Carter and Jameson can (or can’t) hear
43

JAMESON
Be careful Big snow drift
picking up on the right
Carter turns his head to respond to Jameson--

CARTER’S POV Blood spatter dots the back of Jamesons
helmet along with part of the co-pilot seat

Jameson turns slightly to give Carter a crooked smile
CLOSE ON the reflection in Jameson’s visor-

Revealing GRIGGS-THING in the back tearing into Olan-
Blood spurting everywhere in the rear compartment-—-

CARTER
HOLY SHIT—

Carter whips his head around and Jameson does the same
just as Olan is HURLED into the cockpit bashing against
both the men and-—

ON THE ALTITUDE STICK as Jameson’s arm jams against it

EXT THULE STATION — CONTINUOUS
On Kate and Edvard watching the helicopter-
It lists and spins lazily veering away from camp-

KATE
Something’s wrong

The helicopter continues to veer off course up and
toward the nearby mountains-

INT SEA KING HELICOPTER CONTINUOUS

On Carter in the cockpit trying to land--

CARTER
Get off the stick

But Jameson is out cold in the co-pilot seat-

Carter yanks the stick pulling up hard--
44

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

Back with Kate and Edvard watching the Sea King lift
turn and arc in a collision course for the mountain just
beyond the camp

It seems Carter manages to get enough control at the last
moment to avoid crashing into the cliff-side but then

The helo dips just over the rocks and on the other side
of the peak

A beat passes then-

A massive firecloud erupts over the top of the cliffside
and moments later the sound of the massive explosion
reaches the station

EDVARD
Jesus

Kate holds her hand over her mouth In shock

WIDE ANGLE on the camp with the pillar of smoke starting
to rise behind the mountain behind it then

Back on Kate

KATE
What can we do Can we get to
them Up there

EDVARD
Not by ground vehicles

Juliette Peder Leon and Jonas run outside none really
dressed for the cold their attention drawn to the
direction Kate and Edvard are staring

They all stare at the pluming cloud the chimney stack of
smoke reaching up into the sky

INT THULE STATION RADIO ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Colin sits at the communications desk holding the radio
mic Edvard and Kate behind him Jonas and Peder hang by
the doorway Jonas chews gum nervously

COLIN
Hailing McMurdo or any ears on
emergency channel do you copy
Repeat this is Thule Station
test for echo-

Juliette enters the room sensing the commotion Hugging
herself as if cold

KATE
Don’t you have a chopper

EDVARD
He went to Haley to get more
kerosene for the generators
Without radio he could be another
day maybe two

COLIN
(re radio)
I can‘t reach the next room on
this bloody thing

Adam arrives Kate pulls him aside

KATE
Does Sander know

ADAM
Yeah But he’s not leaving the lab
for anything
Kate looks down at the palm of her hand Pondering her
next move
INT RESTROOM MOMENTS LATER

Kate stands at the door to the shower

ANGLE ON the stall where not half an hour ago its walls
were spattered with blood

The shower stall has been rinsed Only faint traces of
blood now in the grout along the drain

Kate’s evidence is dwindling She touches one wall still
wet from being rinsed

INT THULE STATION MED LAB - DAY

Tight on Sanders open palm now holding the fillings in
his own hand

Sander eyes Kate who stands before him by the exam
table Juliette and Adam work at the table by the
microscope Both are obviously eavesdropping on the
conversation

SANDER
All right Let’s presume these are
silver fillings as you say

KATE
Yes-- because the creature rejects
inorganic material The bullets

SANDER
But youre saying it can fully
imitate a human being What about
these fillings tells you that
Wheres the science Kate Where’s
the proof Without it I can’t
help you

Kate doesn’t answer She’s taut with frustration Looks
to Adam for any kind of backup

SANDER (CONTD)
He can’t either

Adam doesn’t speak up Juliette chimes in

JULIETTE (0S)
Doctor Halvorson

Juliette points at the large tube-screen monitor hooked
to the microscope to display the magnified view

ON SCREEN blood cells swimming in a clotted sea The
activity is sluggish but there

SANDER
That’s it yes Look at this
There is still cellular activity
in the blood

Kate’s attention moves to the twisted gnarled corpse of
the Thing with its half-mutated dogs like lumps in
various places on its body

She seems to realize what Sander is suggesting before
anyone else does

KATE
Its still alive

SANDER
We just might be able to salvage
something from this after all

Kate looks to Adam Are you going to side with Sander on
this too
Al

ADAM
Uh Sander Maybe we should freeze
this before decomp spoils it

SANDER
Yes yes Juliette get some men
and take it to cold storage

Kate leaves ahead of Juliette With the women gone
Sander nods at Adam

SANDER (CONT ‘D)
Finish photographing Well run
another batch when I return

Sander moves for the exit pulling off his surgical
gloves

Adam remains alone with the corpse of the creature

He turns back around to watch the blood cells on the
monitor Adjusts the hue and magnification with the
microscope

Behind him one of the limbs of the half-absorbed dogs
suddenly TWITCHES And then relaxes draping over the lip
of the table

Adam doesn‘t see it

He takes the petridish sample off the microscope slides
a coverlet over the glass and crouches down

ANGLE ON a small refrigeration unit where lab samples are
stored Adam opens the short door and places the petri
dish inside--

INT SPRYTE — DAY

--and Kate reaches into the glove compartment to this
Spryte pulling out a set of large binoculars

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

Kate stares up at the rocky cliffs where the Sea King
erashed down

Only a faint finger of smoke curls up from the crash site
now

Kate raises the binoculars looking for any sign of life

BINOCULARS POV

Nothing but snow and rocks hiding view of where the
helicopter went down

The magnified view is obscured by snowfall carried in the
wind Bad weather on its way

RESUME KATE
She lowers the binoculars

And Juliette is standing right behind her

Kate senses a presence and nearly jumps when she sees-—

JULIETTE
Kate Can we talk

Juliette seems nervous Glances back at the base

KATE
Sure What’s wrong

Juliette opens the door to the Spryte and gestures to
get them in out of the wind

JULIETTE
In here

INT SPRYTE - MOMENTS LATER
Kate and Juliette sit in the front seats

JULIETTE
You were saying about the alien
how maybe it could have attacked
one of us

KATE
Juliette Sander was right Even
if its true I don’t have any
proof

JULIETTE
I think I do

Juliette holds up a heavy ECW insulated BOOT
Its sole has been torn around the toe flapping open
JULIETTE (CONT‘D)

I found these under the bench in
the changing room

She pulis out a pair of cold-weather GLOVES from the leg
of the boot

the gloves have been shredded at the fingers Spots of
blood mar the nowfingerless ends

JULIETTE (CONTD)
Dees this mean what I think it
does

Kate inspects them with growing suspicion

KATE
Whose are these

JULIETTE
Lars He was one of the ones who
stayed behind

KATE
He was here when it escaped

Juliette nods

A muddled BANG distracts them both

Through the Spryte’s windshield they spy PEDER and LARS
carrying the bagged remains of the Dog-Thing across the
station grounds toward the Cold Storage Shed

JULIETTE
That is him with the beard

Kate watches closely

KATE
What does he do

JULIETTE
He’s the cook

Lars suddenly looks their way Squints his eyes to see
who is inside the Spryte

Juliette hunches down in her chair slightly Unnerved

Lars nearly drops his end of the body bag and the
remains threaten to tumble to the ground

Peder averts the spill and waits for Lars to regain his
footing and they move for the shed

Kate eyes him suspiciously

JULIETTE (CONTD)
I should get back inside I just
don’t know what to do with these

KATE
I‘ll keep them
(beat)
Juliette Thank you

Juliette nods at Kate and hurries toward the door to the
main station building

Kate looks back toward the cold storage shed

EXT COLD STORAGE SHED —- MOMENTS LATER

Kate approaches the door and listens Eavesdropping

INT COLD STORAGE SHED CONTINUOUS

Peder and Lars heft the body bag into an ultra-—wide
freezer unit

The two men speak in NORWEGIAN

Lars gestures toward the body bag Still speaking in
NORWEGIAN ending as if it were a question

Peder shrugs Lights a cigarette

The two men stare at each other a beat

Lars nods at Peder

Peder hands him the cigarette and Lars takes a drag

THROUGH THE CRACK between the door and the frame Kate
peers in

A moment between the two Norwegian men A pause Each
eyeing the other Is this about sharing a cigarette

Piercing the silence a FIRE ALARM

The men jump and look toward the main building

EXT COLD STORAGE SHED CONTINUOUS

Kate backs from the door and hides around the corner
facing the main building
Sl

The two men rush for the main door They don’t notice
Kate behind them

INT THULE STATION KITCHEN MOMENTS LATER

The fire alarm BLARES louder here

Adam stands in the dining area adjoining the kitchen
Other MEN from the base come rushing in their attention
first on Adam and then on what Adam is staring at (OS)

Edvard joins in late shouting over the klaxon

EDVARD
Who set off the alarm

He then sets sights on the object of everyones
attention

BLOOD SPATTER sprayed along the corner and atop the round
table in the small dining nook

ADAM
I came in to get a soda and-— This
is it This is how I found it

Edvard frowns He looks to Jonas nearby Gives Jonas the
neck-slice “cut it off” signal and Jonas turns to the
wall fire alarm unit

A moment later the alarm dies

Peder and Lars enter the room taking off their heavy
winter gear

JONAS
Whose blood is it

EDVARD
Anyone missing

People look around at the various faces

PEDER
Just Doctor Halvorson

EDVARD
(to Adam)
Get him

Adam leaves

JONAS
It doesn’t make sense There
aren’t any prints

EDVARD
What

JONAS
Away from the table No bloody
prints It’s like someone just
exploded and disappeared
Jonas raises a Nikon F2 camera and takes a snapshot

ANGLE ON the table and corner His analogy is accurate

JONAS (CONTD)
Who’s bleeding

LEON
I’m fine

PEDER
Not me

JONAS

Thats nearly a liter of blood
This is not a superficial wound

Others AD-LIB similar answers
Kate speaks up over them

KATE
It got to someone

Sander arrives with Adam in time to hear this

EDVARD
What do you mean

SANDER
Youre panicking Kate Stick with
what we know

Kate ignores him focusing on Edvard

KATE
This creature it’s a chameleon A
mimic It didn’t just kill the
dogs-— it absorbed them
Understand It became them

SANDER
No it didn’t It did no such--

EDVARD
Let her finish

KATE
Thats how it spreads And blends
in It’s already gotten to one of
us It may have been responsible
for the crash It could still be
among us now

SANDER
Listen We may have evidence that
the creature was cloning itself
into the huskies but that was
just a physical copy Tissue
Blood

EDVARD
So it can look human

SANDER
For it to deceive the rest of us
it would have to be absolutely
perfect in look and behavior To
speak our language and understand
what it’s saying To fathom all
the subtleties of human
interaction and play the part
Impossible

It’s a good defense Kate has no rebuttal
Edvard weighs both sides

EDVARD
We go for help Lars and I will
take a Spryte and try to reach
US Outpost 31 It’s the closest
from here They can call for help

The group - relieved at this news - begins to spring
into action

SANDER
Does my expert opinion account for
nothing We’re in the presence of
the greatest discovery of all
time
(in Norwegian)
Are we not scientists

EDVARD
I‘ve lost two of my men already
My friends I won’t loge any more

Sander grabs Edvard’s arm desperation in his voice
SANDER
Don’t make their deaths worthless
Give me the time I need with this
specimen
Edvard regards Sander with a sadness
EDVARD
Sander one day your work will
consume you

And everyone moves on accepting that Edvard won this
argument

Sander shoots a look of contempt and betrayal at Kate
who is not so sure if she is right

EXT THULE STATION DAY

The daylight itself seems cold casting a blue-grey pall
over the camp

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER

Juliette steps out of Edvard’s office into the hall and
Kate catches up to her from farther back

KATE
Juliette there you are

JULIETTE
Kate I was about to look for you

Kate looks over her shoulder and then spies a door to
Peder’s personal workshopstorage room

She opens the door and peers in
No one’s there

KATE
In here

Kate enters Juliette pauses concerned She looks left
and right for signs of anyone else in the hall then
follows Kate inside

INT PEDER‘S STORAGE ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Shelving stocked with extra fire extinguishers
nonperishables unlabéled boxes paint cans and cleaning
supplies A weak overhead lamp

Juliette shuts the door behind them

KATE
We can’t let Lars leave
JULIETTE

I know I thought the same thing
But how can we stop him

Kate begins pacing collecting her thoughts

KATE
Maybe we go to Edvard in private
I’1ll show him the gloves

Juliette is already shaking her head ‘No’

JULIETTE
I just talked to him He didn’t
believe me He wants proof like
your friend Sander said

KATE
Then we have to do something
(right at Juliette)
We have to disable the vehicles

Juliette reacts for a quick moment but starts to nod

JULIETTE
That could be complicated

KATE

I know a little about mechanics
It wont be that hard Are the
Sprytes locked

JULIETTE
Yes But Peder keeps a spare
set of keys in his drawer

Juliette looks over at--
A WORK BENCH against the wall with a shallow drawer
Kate puts a reassuring hand on Juliette’s shoulder then

moves to the work bench clicks on the small desk lamp on
the surface and slides the drawer open

She begins rummaging through the drawer

KATE
How many keys am I looking for

THE DRAWER is littered with odds and ends Screws and
washers tape measure work rags and soon- a key
labeled with a yellow key-chain

Kate’s hand holds it to the yellow light of the desk
lamp

JULIETTE (0S)
Five Two Sprytes two bulldozers
and a flatbed

Kate finds a second key and puts it on the desktop This
one with a green key chain label and a number 2

KATE
That‘’s two

ANGLE ON JULIETTE behind Kate as bone segments PUSH out
of Juliette’s skin and clothes sliding into place like
bony armor outside her blouse

BACK TO THE DRAWER with Kate’s hand rustling noisily
through the items the sounds masking the transformation
happening right behind her

KATE (CONTD)
Three and four

Juliette’s HEAD peels back to reveal a wide mouth the
jawline widening and distended like a great white shark‘s
maw Juliette’s eyes displaced and black

Kate hears it now and turns around-—

Juliette-thing completes its transformation into a kind
of chitinous CREATURE its claws and mandibles reaching
for Kate-—

Reacting in a flash Kate reaches back--

HER HAND finds the desk lamp and in one quick motion-
She SMASHES the lamp against Juliette-thing’s HEAD-

POP The bulb bursts and the creature is jolted with
electricity--

Kate dives around the half-beetle creature as it shudders
from electrocution—

FOLLOWING KATE as she crawls over a desk between her and
the door out-

TUMBLING over the desk as JulietteThing WHIRLS AROUND in
pursuit—-

Kate gets up again and reaches the door
But it’s LOCKED-
She fumbles with the little knob-lock-

Behind her sounds of the desk screeching on the floor as
it’s pushed out of the way by Juliette—Thing--

Kate gets the door open and launches herself out into-

INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

-where she gets up to find LEON stepping out from a room
across the hall and down a few feet

LEON
What the hell is-

Leon’s eyes go wide fixing on something behind Kate

Kate gets to her feet and doesn’t look back doesn’t slow
down just RUNS past Leon--

KATE
RUN

Leon understands a moment too late his body turning to
start to run with Kate--

ON KATE as she passes him and keeps moving down the hall--

When A GUSH OF BLOOD SPATTERS on the wall and Leon’s arm
flails into view before 08

KEEPING ON KATE as she makes it to the interior hall door
at a Tt intersection-

Flinging herself against the door and then holding it
shut with her body--

Leon’s SCREAMS just inside cut off short quickly-

Approaching her in this hall are ADAM and COLIN with
LARS trailing a few steps behind

The door SHUDDERS as the creature bashes against it-

Colin and Adam stop in their tracks and Lars turns and
runs back down the way he came--

From the other side of the door Juliette-Thing can be
heard banging against the door the wood rattling in its
frame with every strike

ADAM
Jesus Christ what happened

KATE
Help me brace the door

Adam tentatively steps for Kate and the door--

A bony claw-tipped hand PUNCHES THROUGH the door at face
level splintering wood--

Adam turns away and runs-

KATE (CONT’D)
Adam

Kate and Colin hold fast trying to keep Juliette-Thing
trapped inside

TIGHT ON a flamethrower held in a man’s arms stepping
around the corner

REVEAL the man holding the weapon LARS
Kate sees Lars and her eyes go wide
Kate suddenly opens the door wide for him--

Juliette-Thing is RIGHT THERE beetle-mouth and small
antennae-limbs ready to strike at Lars-

Lars stares in shock just a beat
Kate shouts--

KATE (CONT’D)
Burn it

Lars squeezes the trigger and FIRBS--
Juliette-Thing is engulfed in flame--
It screeches in agony flailing madly--
It strikes feebly at Lars but misses--

Juliette-Thing comes charging out into the hallway--
Lars dives out of the way as it runs past him-

It manages to stumble into the kitchen still dressed in
fire burning alive catching fire to the ceiling as it
flees--

Kate helps Lars up and the two pursue it into--

INT THULE STATION KITCHEN CONTINUOUS

They arrive to find Juliette-Thing still burning now
yanking at the exposed water pipes to the kitchen sink-—

The creature is powerfully strong and the pipe SNAPS
spewing water on the burning form-

It is putting the fire out

KATE
Don’t let it-—

Lars holds up his hand to say I know I know
He torches the creature again
It stumbles from the gushing water pipe Falls

Lars approaches and gives it one more squeeze from the
flamethrower

Juliette-Thing finally stops flailing Its bony armored
form crashes to the floor

The water keeps spraying everywhere And fire starts to
spread beyond the reach of the leaky pipe

Jonas and Colin enter carrying fire extinguishers They
start choking the fire before it gets out of control

Kate grabs Lars’s collar and shouts over the sound of the
extinguishers

KATE (CONT’D)
Leon

Lars looks back at her confused

LARS
Leon

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The hall where Leon’s blood is smeared along the wall
Empty

But blood trails off into the open door of Peder’s
Storage room

Kate leads Lars in

INT PEDER’S STORAGE ROOM CONTINUOUS
Wo sign of Leon But more blood on the floor

And a sharp wind from the small broken WINDOW above the
work bench

KATE
Outside

She leads Lars back out into the hallway--

EXT THULE STATION MOMENTS LATER

The two of them burst out the side entrance not
completely suited up for the extreme cold weather

Already the sunlight has begun to wane

Others have caught up with the chaos and follow Kate and
Lars outside trying to figure out what’s going on
Edvard Sander Adam and Peder join the group

THE SNOW reveals blood-spotted footprints leading to

THE VEHICLE GARAGE maybe two dozen paces away

Sound of something RATTLING

Lars and Kate round the corner of the garage for a view
of the Large bay roll-down doors

Leon has his hands on the chain wrapped and locked around
the garage door Pulling hard

KATE
HEY

Leon lets go and faces the group Breathing hard

The others are out of breath too- and their breath
plumes before their faces in the crisp air Yet--

Leons breath is not visible As if his body were as cold
as the snow

His skin is somewhat translucent like an unborn
infants revealing blood vessels and bone underneath
slowly becoming more opaque

Leon isn’t quite finished transforming

Eyelashes protrude from his eyelids one at a time

His eyes shift color until they match the real Leon

- His mouth opens like a wound and seals itself in human-
looking lips

Fingernails slide into place from the flesh of his
fingertips

Everyone gathered around Leon watches in horror and awe

Leon raises his hands in surrender

LEON
Everything is okay I’m fine

Lars sneers and burns Leon where he stands WHOOSH
Leon WAILS that same alien multi-pitch screech
The group stares in total horror

Edvard frowns angered

EXT THULE STATION MOMENTS LATER

Leons corpse still burns most of it an ashen pile his
limbs still orange-hot cinders in the snow

The group has now been joined by Sander Jonas and Colin
Everyone is here

Among them Peder now wears the backup flamethrower

KATE
This thing had an agenda A
strategy It convinced me that
someone else was the creature
Trying to turn us against one
another while it remained hidden
But when its plan was threatened
it attacked

JONAS
Wait Someone else Who did she--
(correcting)
Who did it name

KATE
(beat)
Lars

Everyone looks at Lars who wasn’t paying attention to
the English until his name was mentioned Now he looks
noticeably concerned

LARS
(in Norwegian)
What

EDVARD
Then that’s it Nobody goes
anywhere alone

COLIN
How do we know it didn’t get you
I mean how can we know

KATE
You can’t It can be any of us

COLIN
Oh that’s just bloody great

ADAM
IT know it’s not me

JONAS
Me neither So I’m getting the
hell out of here

COLIN
I’m with him

KATE
No Nobody can leave We have to
disable the vehicles--

This causes an uproar

EDVARD
Kate You can’t possibly expect us
to deprive ourselves of the only
means of escape we have

She tries to respond but is drowned out by the ADLIB
ruckus of the crowd People already accusing others of
being untrustworthy others ready to leave Then

SANDER
She‘s right
(beat)
She’s right No one can leave

The group quiets
Sander looks overly tired Grim

SANDER (CONTD)
This thing spends ten thousand
years frozen in the ice waiting
for a life form sophisticated
enough to come along and free it
Tt then successfully imitates a
person so well we all believe the
lie It tricks manipulates and
kills to achieve its end

EDVARD
Which is

On Kate with the answer

KATE
Escape

SANDER

(pacing)
What we are dealing with here is
a survivor Advanced as any
organism I could’ve imagined and
stubborn as any single-celled
bacteria or virus I’ve seen

(stopping)
To let it leave and God forbid
reach the outside world Disaster
It would spread like a silent
epidemic No one could stop it

EDVARD
Juliette and Leon are dead The
Americans as well How do we know
we‘ve killed all the imitations

KATE
We don’t But we have to figure
out a way to be sure

SANDER
A test Yes I think I could-
with some time and what remains of
the dogs I could do it

Edvard seems reluctant to agree to the idea Shaking his
head he gives in

EDVARD
All right We disable the
vehicles You work up a test
(MORE )

EDVARD (CONTD)
And from now on nobody goes
anywhere alone I mean it

The rest of the group stares suspiciously at each other
for a beat then begins to disperse in pairs or groups
of three

Kate nods at Sander the two of them now separated a bit
from the others

Sander fumbles for a non-apology where he still retains
his sense of authority

SANDER
Kate I didn’t have all the data
I needed

KATE
It‘s okay Just figure out a
test

Sander nods and moves on Kate notices her hands are
trembling

INT COLD STORAGE SHED —- EVENING
Peder and Jonas stare at the dog remains in the body bag

Neither of them moves to it right away

PEDER
You get that end
JONAS
I’m not touching it first
PBEDER
It’s dead
JONAS

Then why would Sander need it

Beat Both men are tense Jonas finally steps in and
grabs one end of the bag

Peder grabs the other and they heft it off the table
Jonas suddenly drops his end and backs off--

JONAS (CONTD)
Did it move I thought

PEDER
It’s frozen Come on let’s get
this over with

Jonas cautiously lifts it again

INT THULE STATION MED LAB —- MOMENTS LATER
The body bag lands with a THUMP

Sander opens the plastic to find the pile of dog remains
and half-mutated alien monster frozen solid

SANDER
Took you long enough

Sander positions heat lamps overhead

Peder and Jonas stare at the twisted thing Neither of
them look happy

JONAS
Now what

SANDER
It will take an hour to thaw

Jonas and Peder glance at each other then back at
Sander

INT RESTROOM — EVENING

Adam washes his hands and face at the sink

He stares at his own reflection for a beat The splash of
fresh water on his face did nothing to help the pale
clammy look of his skin under fluorescent light

Edvard enters the restroom and stops when he sees Adam

Adam wheels around on Edvard

EDVARD
What are you doing here

Beat

ADAM
It’s the bathroom

EDVARD
How long have you been alone

Edvard’s gaze travels around the bathroom inspecting it
for signs of anything suspect
ADAM
Maybe five minutes Ask Sander
EDVARD
Anyone else come in here during
that time
ADAM
Just you How long have YOU been
alone

The two stare at each other a beat
EDVARD
Oh for Christ’s sake I just came
in here to take a piss

ADAM
Yeah Okay Okay

The two circle each other Edvard moves away from the
door and Adam moves for it

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM -— EVENING

Colin shuffles a deck of cards at the corner table
Jonas enters with a drink and approaches him

JONAS
Deal me in

COLIN
You know it The usual

JONAS
Yah yah

Colin begins to deal a game of Gin Rummy

Peder steps in and crosses to the pinball machine in
other corner

As the sounds of the pinball game chime Colin leans
speak quietly to Jonas

COLIN
Hey When’s the last time Peder
went out for a smoke

Jonas shrugs

JONAS
I don’t know Why

the

to

Colin keeps staring at Jonas until it dawns on Jonas why
he’s asking
Jonas stares at Peder whose back is to the two card
players while he jostles the pinball machine

INT VEHICLE GARAGE EVENING

The hood of a Spryte lifts up exposing the guts of the
engine underneath

With a flashlight and wire cutters Lars reaches in and
clips a set of plugs near the battery

Kate stands nearby with her own flashlight
Lars looks her way and nods We notice now that he’s
still wearing the flame unit on his back Ready at a

moment’s notice to torch someone

KATE
Is that it Any more

Gesturing to try and help him understand
Lars shakes his head Thats the last of the vehicles
She nods

KATE (CONTD)
Okay

Behind them at the open roll-top door Edvard arrives
watching Solemn

EDVARD
Visibility is dropping Another
whiteout rolling in No one will
be able to get in

KATE
Good Gives us time to test
everyone
Edvard lets out a worried breath
EDVARD
I hope you know what you’re doing

EXT THULE STATION MOMENTS LATER

Snow falls at dusk A hundred yards out in any direction
and it looks like an old TV with no reception

Edvard Lars and Kate make their way from the garage to
the base

ars looks left as they march--
Then does a double take He grabs Kate and points

IN THE DISTANCE through the static storm of snow two
FIGURES limp toward them Silhouettes

Edvard notices too The look on faces Shock
KATE
(sotto)
Carter

Lars hurries for the base entrance and punches the alarm

INT THULE STATION MED LAB —- CONTINUOUS

Sander looks up from the thawing corpse as the alarm
echoes loudly inside

The other men look up as well

SANDER
For fuck’s sake what now

Jonas and Peder hurry out

Sander gestures at Adam to follow

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

THE FIGURES get nearer Kate moves for them as they
stumble forward Revealing--

Yes Carter And Jameson Both frostbitten Ice clinging
to their ECW gear and faces Wounded but alive

The two men clutch each other for support Jameson
finally loses the strength in his legs and falls to his
knees Carter tries to help him up but collapses to one
knee himself

KATE
Jesus Carter

Edvard holds Kate back

EDVARD
Don‘t touch them

The two Navy men don’t look like they could put up much
of a fight

Lars rejoins Kate with his flamethrower out Peder
Jonas and Adam spill out in a semicircle around Carter
and Jameson

Carter tries to speak but his throat is too dry at first

KATE
Youre frostbitten Let’s get you
inside

EDVARD

That is a bad idea

KATE
You got a better one

Adam looks at Carter and Jameson skeptically His nerves
are apparent in his voice

ADAM
We should burn them

CARTER

(raspy)
What the fuck-

KATE
They just walked down a mountain
after a helicopter crash

ADAM
Exactly

EDVARD
Impossible for a human to survive
that

JAMESON
(hoarse)
Bullshit

ADAM
We can’t take any chances

KATE
We’re not murdering them

EDVARD
It’s not murder It’s survival

Carter finds the strength to stand up And help Jameson
up Then he weakly steps toward the door

Peder blocks Carter’s path aiming the flame unit

CARTER
Out Of The way

Kate steps in Peder’s line of fire holding out her arms

KATE
Wait We don’t have to kill
anyone

EDVARD
Move Kate

KATE

We can just tie them up until
Sander’s test is ready

Beat The men consider this

Carter looks like he’s been awake for a week straight He
and Jameson just want inside where it’s warm

Peder finally lowers his flamethrower and steps aside

EXT THULE STATION — EVENING

High angle on the base as the snowstorm descends

INT GENERATOR ROOM EVENING

The fire damage from earlier still scars the floor and
walls in this noisy room

Carter and Jameson stand in a corner where the large
diesel generator purrs loudly

The two freezing men hold out their hands before it-- the
machine is a surrogate heater

Lars stands inside the door Guarding with his
flamethrower ready

Kate enters carrying warm food from the kitchen Lars
nods at her as she squeezes past

JAMESON
This is BULLSHIT man Fuckin’
bullshit stuck out here-

She sets the food tray atop the non-working generator
near Carter

KATE
This should help warm you up

CARTER
Thanks

Jameson doesn’t talk he just starts eating His hands
are trembling

Kate watches the men a moment As she starts to turn
away Carter grabs her sleeve--

CARTER (CONT’D)
Hey--

Lars tenses and says something in Norwegian Aims the
flamethrower at Carter Carter lets go

KATE
Yeah

CARTER
What happened

KATE
I was going to ask you

CARTER
Something got to Griggs

Searching for the words to describe what he saw

KATE
It got to more than just Griggs

Carter understands the situation now

BOOOOM A muffled explosion rattles the generator room
Everyone is instantly on edge at the sound

JAMESON
(mouth half-full)
What was that

Kate moves to the door where Lars peers outside

FOLLOWING outside to

EXT THULE STATION CONTINUOUS

Discovering smoke curling up from the roof of the
station’s main building

Lars says something ominous in Norwegian Unaware Kate
reiterates what Lars just said

KATE
The lab

Kate moves toward the entrance to the station through
the snowfall

Lars turns and shuts Carter and Jameson in-
Carter rushes for the door--

CARTER
Wait don’t--

-and the door is LOCKED from the outside Carter tries
the door but can’t get it open

CARTER (CONTD)
God damnit

Looking back at Jameson who still has a mouth full of
soup-soaked bread

JAMESON
Fuck ‘em all man

On Carter looking for a way out

INT THULE STATION MED LAB — MOMENTS LATER

The room is completely ablaze Fire consumes the exam
table the work desks the microscope station

A large broken two-gallon jug rolls on the floor
vomiting more flammable liquid

Adam and Jonas try to enter from the door but the heat
pushes them back Both are armed with fire extinguishers
They immediately start spraying into the room to choke
back the fire

The flames retreat

Adam and Jonas get bolder stepping into the room and
spraying the walls to keep the fire from jumping to the
ceiling or an adjoining room

Ceiling tiles fall from the intense heat

Adam catches his breath coughs He’s reached the lab’s

exam table The table is completely charred
As is Sander’s test All of it ruined

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM — EVENING

Adam and Jonas sit slumped at the poker table Exhausted
smeared with soot and numb with shock

Pulling back as we hearsee the scene around them Peder
and Edvard arguing with Sander and Colin Kate and Lars
stand so as to avoid looking like they’ve chosen sides
with either group

SANDER
Who do you think Maybe the man
with the flamethrower

PEDER
I was nowhere near the lLab-

EDVARD
That was some homemade explosive
not a flamethrower-

COLIN
How do you know

Kate puts her hands to her temples tired of all the
arguing around her Knowing this is what the Thing wants

EDVARD
What are you implying

COLIN
Who said I was implying--

SANDER
-don’t have any other way to test
the group and it was my idea-

The SHOUTING continues but Kate touches Sander’s arm to
get his attention

KATE
There’s another way

Sander questions her for just a moment before shouting
over the angry Norwegians

SANDER
Shut up There may be another way

This quiets everyone

Sander gestures at Kate to give her the floor

Kate wasn’t ready for this She thought Sander would pull
her aside instead of putting her in the spotlight

After a beat of uncertainty she steps in The look on
her face is like a poker player going “all in”

KATE
We can’t know for sure which of us
is one of those Things But at
least we can tell who isn’t

ADAM
What

JONAS
How

KATE

(to Jonas)
Hand me your flashlight

Jonas pulls his small pen-sized flashlight from his
breast pocket and hands it to Kate

KATE (CONT’D)
This creature can’t imitate
inorganic material Like silver

Kate opens her mouth pulls one cheek aside to expose a
molar where a SILVER FILLING shines in the light

Lars seems to instantly get it Fillings yes He snaps
his fingers at Kate and declares something in Norwegian
as if to say “Of course the teeth”

He lowers his own jaw to expose a silver crown on one
tooth

KATE (CONTD)
So you know Lars and I are human
Jonas open up

Sander approaches Kate suddenly imploring--

SANDER
Kate this is ridiculous--

But Kate takes two steps back behind Lars
Lars levels the flamethrower right at Sander

Sander lowers his hands

KATE
This is just a precaution So we
know who we can eliminate right
here and now Okay

Adam chuckles It’s that nervous insomniac’s laugh that
suggests Adam has lost as much sanity as he has sleep

Jonas opens his mouth
Flashlight reveals metal fillings
Kate steps to Adam next

KATE (CONT’D)

Adam

ADAM
I‘m going to get killed because I
flossed

KATE

Nobody’s getting killed Open
He does so No cavities

KATE (CONT ’D)
Okay Just stand over there

SANDER
You don’t know if this works
(to others)
She’s operating on a hunch not
scientific theory

KATE
A hunch is better than nothing

She clicks on the pen light at his mouth waiting for
Sander to open up for her

SANDER
They’re porcelain

Beat Sander feels he’s stumped the test

KATE
Go stand by Adam
(to rest)
Anyone else with porcelain
fillings Or clean teeth

Colin turns to Edvard to appeal

COLIN
You need me on the radio Tell her
she can’t tie me up for having
healthy teeth boss Tell her

Edvard lets out a breath shakes his head and moves next
to Sander

Colin stares on in shock

EDVARD
Mine are porcelain too

SANDER
Edvard youre still in charge
(in Norwegian)
We can’t let paranoia rule this
camp

Kate ignores Sander To Peder and Jonas

KATE
This is just a safety precaution
Okay Temporary

JONAS
What now

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM - LATER

Jonas backs up from a chair where Adam sits bound with
utility rope

ADAM
Really Really This is the plan

Sander is tied down similarly in a chair nearby All four
men (Adam Sander Edvard Colin) are tied to chairs set
about five feet away from each other in this large rec
room The pool table has been pushed aside

Colin starts to scoot himself farther away from the
others He’s jittery Nervous

COLIN
Don’t put me so bloody close to
these lads

Kate moves to a window and peers outside at the
snowstorm

Sander sneers at Kate

SANDER
You can’t do this Kate You don’t
know what you’re doing
(to others)
She’s just a grad student

KATE
This is the safest move until we
know for sure who’s human
(breath)
Jonas can you and Lars get Carter
and Jameson from the shed We need
to check them too

Jonas looks over at the four tied to chairs

Edvard makes eye contact with Jonas And nods slightly
As if to give him approval to listen to Kate

Kate notices
JONAS
Okay Yeah all right
(to Lars in
Norwegian)
Come on You’re with me
Lars looks to Kate You sure
Kate nods slightly Letting him go
The two men leave the Rec Room

Peder remains behind still armed with his flamethrower
steadily watching the men tied to the chairs

Kate rubs her forehead She’s been up for more than two
days straight Exhaustion is setting in on everyone in
camp but Kate feels it the most right now

Sander meets Peder’s gaze And starts talking to Peder in
NORWEGIAN This statement is made without subtitles

Kate’s attention shifts between Sander and Peder
Sander says something else in NORWEGIAN

Peder REPLIES Kate asks without sounding like it‘s a
question but more of a demand

KATE
What’s he saying
(to Sander)
What are you saying

SANDER
None of your business

Kate steps up to Sander gripping something

A NAVY HANDGUN One of the pistols taken off Carter or
Jameson Aimed at Sander

SANDER (CONT’D)
What You going to shoot me

KATE
Would it do anything if I did

SANDER
What was the term again Toasty
Is that what has gotten to you

Peder steps up with his flamethrower Pointed more at
Kate than the others

Colin sees he is slightly in the line of fire He HOPS
his chair to the side a little Toward Adam

ADAM
Stay away from me

SANDER
(to Kate)
Look Just untie us
(to Peder)
And we will figure this out
together

EDVARD
Wait

Sander whips his head around to glare at Edvard

SANDER
What

EDVARD
I agree with Kate This is the
smartest option Unless you have
a better idea

Colin looks over at his boss in frustration
COLIN
Oh don’t you start siding with
her now In case you hadn’t
noticed we’re royally fucked

Kate pays them no heed She returns to the window

KATE
We wait until Carter and Jameson
are brought inside Just a couple
of minutes

Peder considers this plan Nods Yeah okay
KATE’S POV reveals the silhouettes of Lars and Jonas in
the snowstorm as they venture far enough away to be
enshrouded in white
EXT THULE STATION - NIGHT
Jonas and Lars lean into the wind and advance through the
walls of snowfall Jonas clasps Lars on the shoulder and
shouts into his ear
JONAS
(in Norwegian)
Can’t we just take the Spryte and
get the hell out of here

Lars stares at Jonas a beat then grabs him by the arm
and leads him onward The implied answer No

They reach the generator shed The door hangs slightly
ajar The knob and bolt have been badly damaged by some
blunt weapon or device

Lars and Jonas exchange looks

Lars steps up first flamethrower at the ready

NT GENERATOR ROOM — CONTINUOUS
Stepping inside The room is dark

Lars flips the Light--—

Empty No sign of Carter or Jameson
Jonas looks in from over Lars’s shoulder

JONAS
Shit

Lars steps in further looking for any signs of the two
Americans

JONAS (CONT’D)

(in Norwegian)
We need to go back and tell the
others
LARS
(in Norwegian)
No

Lars pushes past Jonas going back outside

EXT GENERATOR ROOM CONTINUOUS
Jonas catches up

LARS
(in Norwegian)
We must find the Americans first
while the tracks are fresh

IN THE SNOW a set of footprints make a sloppy dotted

line for the garage building
Lars moves quickly

Jonas doesn’t notice Lars has moved right away He

looks

back toward the main building first Jonas finally sees

he’s been left alone and starts after Lars in the
The wind biting his face

JONAS POV tracking Lars thirty steps ahead
Lars reaches the door to the garage Kicks at it
The door opens inward into darkness

JONAS
Lars

Over Lars’ shoulder now looking back at Jonas

JONAS (CONT ’D)
Wait

Jonas takes another step toward Lars when a FIGURE
inside the garage grabs and YANKS Lars through the
door and out of sight

ON JONAS unsure what to do next

He decides to flee

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM MOMENTS LATER
Kate keeps watch outside

Peder eats a snack bar guarding the door

snow

from
open

Sander heckles Kate

SANDER
Theyre not coming back

Kate turns her attention from the window

KATE
You don’t know

SANDER
Its taken them too long Lars and
Jonas should have been back by
now Something has gone wrong

KATE
Tt hasn’t been that long

ADAM
Yeah Yeah it has Sander is
right Come on Kate You got
bigger problems now We’re not the
enemy

KATE
You say that because you don’t
want to be tied up

ADAM
I don’t All right One of these
guys could be a monster

PEDER
All the more reason we should keep
you all tied up

COLIN
Oh this is just great This is
perfect-

EDVARD

Colin stay calm

COLIN
What I’m sorry did you say calm

KATE
Give them a few more minutes It
just feels longer because we’re
waiting

PEDER
I don’t think so

A sound carries in the wind outside Sounded like a
brief loud SHOUT of a man in distress-- Jonas

Everyone heard it

Peder tenses Leans into the hall from his station at the
doorway

Beat Some other sounds in the wind-- just corrugated
roofing clapping against one of the buildings Or
something more insidious

SANDER
They’re gone Kate
(to Peder)
You can’t trust Jonas and Lars
now Or the Americans

KATE
Shut up

SANDER
By now it could be four of them
against just two of you Without
our help you’re outnumbered-—

KATE
I said shut up

EDVARD
(to Peder)
Sander has a point The game has
changed We need to barricade this
building right away

KATE
(to Peder)
Do NOT untie them
Peder gives her a glance of consideration but just then
there’s a KNOCK on the side door
INT THULE STATION ECW ROOM CONTINUOUS

Peder rushes to the door and peers through the small
window Kate joins him a moment later

PEDER
Its Jonas

KATE
Where‘s Lars

PEDER
I don’t know

The door POUNDS again

Kate puts her hands on the door to open it Peder leans
against the door to keep it closed

PEDER (CONTD)
Wait What if it’s not him

JONAS (0S8)
Let me inl

Kate pauses She and Peder stare off each questioning
the other or themselves

Kate looks through the small porthole window and shouts
at Jonas

KATE
Open your mouth

Jonas puts his face close to the porthole and opens his
jaw The room’s light glints off his molar fillings

Peder nods at her Okay He backs up still ready with
the flamethrower-

Kate opens the door and Jonas stumbles in shivering
Snow and ice have already collected on his gear

She shuts and bolts the door behind Jonas

Jonas settles down on the bench hugging himself Trying
to get warm again

JONAS
They escaped

Peder keeps watch on Jonas Kate bends down to meet him
eye-to-eye Puts a thumb on his chin and opens his mouth

She glances up at Peder and nods Then

KATE
Where is Lars

JONAS
They got him something got him
over at-- at the garage it was--
too dark and--

KATE
Who was it Carter
84

JONAS
IT couldn’t tell I just ran

A dark SHAPE passes by the small window in this room

Peder is the only one who noticed it He moves to the
window for better view outside

PEDER’S POV
Nothing It was too fast But wait--

A glimpse of a FIGURE rounding the corner of the
building

Peder rushes down the hall Pointing back at Jonas and
Kate on his way--

PEDER
Watch that door

Jonas grabs a chair by his bench and uses it to brace the
heavy door

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM CONTINUOUS

Following Peder as he enters in time to see--

THAT SHADOWY FIGURE pass by the small window in the Rec
Room

Edvard and Sander see it too They were watching where
Peder was looking

PEDER
Damnit

EDVARD
Peder it’s going around to the
other door You need to board this
place up right now

COLIN
Ill help Cut me loose

Peder makes a decision-- he moves for Edvard’s chair
Kate enters sees Peder going for Edvard
Kate grabs Peder by the arm to hold him back--

KATE

No- no wait we can’t-- one of
them could be--
And Peder reflexively elbows her in the chin
Kate goes down hard against the wall Stunned
Peder makes quick work of Edvard’s ropes

He moves over to Sander’s next

SANDER
About bloody time

PEDER
I’m still watching you

The lit nozzle of the flamethrower ventures close to

Sanders head while Peder unties him
Sander leans away fearful
Kate sits up

KATE
Peder just wait--—

ADAM
Don’t listen to her--

PEDER
They have a flamethrower now I am
not letting them inside here

KATE
If they have turned into more of
those Things why would they need
a flamethrower

Peder unties the knots for Adam’s bonds
Edvard pulls at the ropes around Colin’s legs
EDVARD
Maybe they just wanted Lars
eliminated since he had a weapon
(to Peder)

Get the wood from the storage

room I’1ll get the toolbox
Peder nods at Edvard and passes Kate by the door
Edvard follows

COLIN (0S)
Hey guys

Kate and Sander meet each others gaze Sander slowly
shakes his head as he rubs his wrists from where the rope
cut off circulation

KATE
I haven’t lost my mind Sander

SANDER
Worse You‘ve lost my respect

Behind Sander Colin is still tied by the wrists
COLIN
Little help
INT THULE STATION ECW ROOM CONTINUOUS

THE DOORKNOB to the exterior door turns suddenly The
door rattles in its frame

Jonas backs up

JONAS
HEY They‘’re over here

He peers through the window--

JONAS POV The angle isn’t right he can’t see whoever is
right outside the door

The door stops rattling
Edvard arrives with a toolbox in one hand

Kate and Peder get there a moment later Peder holds a
few wooden planks

JONAS (CONTD)

They were just Someone was at

the door-
BOOM-BOOM From some other door to the facility
Peder runs down the hall Everyone follows quickly
dashing past THE REC ROOM where Adam and Sander join in
the crowd
Colin still works to get his wrists untied Lagging
behind
INT THULE STATION REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Peder slides into the small room-

The door here BULGES from being kicked on the other side--
BOOM

Peder puts his weight against it and slams a 2—by-4
against the door--

PEDER
Edvard

Edvard rushes in and sets the toolbox down--

EDVARD
Hold onl

BOOM The door budges again--
Edvard slams a nail into the wood plank securing it--

Peder takes the hammer and pounds another nail into the
other side of the plank--

Kate Sander Adam and Jonas enter the room from the
hall as--

An AXE BLADE punches through the door just above the
nailed two-byfour

Peder and Edvard step back

The axe is yanked out again leaving a jagged HOLE
Beat What now Then--

A FLAMETHROWER NOZZLE pokes in through the hole--

Edvard and Peder dive one way while Kate Jonas and
Sander duck back around the corner--

WHOOSH Flames spew into the room igniting the ceiling
Edvard grabs Jonas by the shoulder-—

EDVARD (CONTD)
Put it out

Jonas rushes back down the hall out of sight--

The door BUCKLES as another heavy kick hits it from the
other side

The two-by-four falls off Beat

KATE
Carter Stand back

Another KICK and the door swings inward--

To reveal the snowstorm raging outside No sign of Carter
or Jameson

Beat Peder stands at the ready flamethrower pointed at
the door

Sander turns on Kate with a ferocity-

SANDER
Whose side are you on

Peder sweats then finally squeezes the trigger

WHOOSH Flames lash out at the snow through the doorway
Peder lets go of the trigger and waits again Looks to
Edvard who nods at him Then cautiously Peder steps

outside just one step to peer around a corner-—

PEDER POV Nothing but snow and dark this direction
Cant even see the end of the building

Whipping around to take a look at the other side-
Where CARTER stands with his flamethrower and WHOOSH

THE OTHERS inside the building see Peder engulfed in
flames-

Peder flails and screams-
Falling back into the room still on fire--

Edvard rushes the door to close it before Peder can fully
enter the room-

He nearly gets the door closed but-

WHAM Peder is KICKED inside causing the door to BASH
Edvard in the head-—

Both Edvard and the burning Peder fall to the floor--
Jonas arrives with a fire extinguisher--
Kate points at Peder and the burning flamethrower-

KATE
Hurry

Immediately Jonas sprays down Peder

The foam puts out the fire but Peder is already dead or
unconscious

His flame unit is at least partially damaged

Kate and the others stand in momentary shock-

The CO-2 mist clears to reveal-

Carter standing at the door Lars’s flamethrower leveled
Kate Jonas Sander Adam and Edvard all back up

Beat Carter stares them down

CARTER
Put out the rest of that fire

Jonas steps forward again and snuffs out the fire on the
wall with two short bursts of C02

Carter looks them over one at a time
They stare back at him Both sides tense

A moment later Jameson enters and goes for Peder’s body
Pulling off the (damaged) flamethrower and standing up
next to Carter

The two American Navy men regard the rest of the group as
officers would a mutinous crew

Jameson struggles to make the damaged flamethrower
operable

KATE
Carter listen to me I can prove
some of us are human

CARTER
I don’t believe you

Behind Kate Edvard groans He hit his head hard

CARTER (CONT’D)
Get his ass up Let’s move this
party to the rec room

Jonas sets down the fire extinguisher unit He and Adam
grab hold of Edvard and lift him up

FOLLOWING the group as it moves down the hall Jonas and
Adam leading with Kate and Sander behind them and
Carter and Jameson in back

Kate looks over her shoulder at Carter Trying to read
him Trying to tell who he is

Carter remains unreadable

The group enters

INT THULE STATION REC ROOM CONTINUOUS

Jonas and Adam drag Edvard toward a couch in the center
of the room

Kate and Sander follow Sander looks back toward Carter

SANDER
Peder was human You killed him

CARTER
Like he had other plans for me

Jonas and Adam reach the couch and start to set Edvard
down One of them has to let the other go first

JONAS
I got him

Adam slides from under Edvard’s arm

Jonas starts leaning down but Edvard’s falling now as his
arm SLIDES out of its sleeve and Jonas is left holding
the detached arm

JONAS (CONT’D)
Holy--

The now-one-armed Edvard collapses to the floor--

ON SEVERED ARM From various parts of the arm INSECTOID
LEGS stab outward turning the limb into a kind of ARM
CENTIPEDE A strange round MOUTH forms at the shoulder

KATE
Get rid of it

Jonas screams and tries to drop it--
The Arm Centipede grabs hold with its hand-
And then BITES Jonas‘s face--

Edvard’s mouth opens and a FROG-LIKE TONGUE lashes out
and wraps around Adam’s ankle--

Adam TRIPS and FALLS to the floor-

ADAM
OH GOD-

Carter sidesteps looking for some position from where he
can fire his flame unit without torching anyone human He
and Jameson AD LIB shouts over the racket--

Kate backs up to a wall cornered--

Sander turns and FLEES for the door--

Edvard-Thing starts to sprout spider-like LEGS from its
chest cavity ripping through Edvard’s shirt--

Adam struggles with his ensnared leg--

Edvard—Thing’s chest lifts off the ground as the spider-
Legs grow-

Sander backs into the hall--

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY CONTINUOUS
--just as Colin runs down the hall toward the rec room

Colin sees the look on Sander‘’s face and immediately
turns back around and flees the way he came

Sander backs all the way to the wall his face set in
shock and horror-
INT THULE STATION REC ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Jameson and Carter have their torches aimed at the large
Edvard-Thing on the floor--

Carter squeezes the trigger on his flame unit but it
only burps out a brief flame--

CARTER
(to Jameson)
Burn it
JAMESON

It won’t work You burn it
From her corner Kate glances at--

JAMESON’S FLAME UNIT specifically a ruptured fuel line
on the backpack

CARTER
T’m out of fuel

JAMESON
Shit--

Edvard-Thing sheds its other ARM and BOTH LEGS so now it
more resembles a giant spider with the head and torso of
a half-man--

The LEGS AND ARM sprout centipede-like appendages just
like the first arm--

Jameson discards the broken flamethrower and pulls out a
HANDGUN-

Adam keeps SCREAMING and kicking at Edvard-Thing-
Jameson FIRES at one of the Centipedes——

It doesn’t seem to have much effect—-

The scurrying Centipede skitters up the wall behind JONAS

who is still struggling with the Arm-Centipede eating his
face-

Jameson aims and SHOOTS Jonas in the head-

Jonas falls to the floor dead The Arm-Centipede on him
scurries away as another bullet punches through its back

Edvard-Thing now ATTACKS ADAM Edvard’s face seemingly
fusing and absorbing Adam’ s-

Adam SCREAMS as it happens

Kate grabs Jamesons discarded flamethrower and yanks off
the fuel line--

Carter shouts at Jameson over the din

CARTER
Get kerosene Go go

Jameson rushes out the door--
The other Arm Centipede advances for Kate--

Kate cuts the ruptured part of the fuel line and jams the
shorter line back into the tank--

Just as the Arm-Centipede launches itself af her--
WHOOSH The Centipede burns It lets out a high-pitched
BLEAT as it burns to death

The other Centipede limbs SCATTER--

Edvard-Thing picks up a half-absorbed Adam and carries
him down the hall out of firing range--

CARTER (CONT’D)
The big one

Too late It’s out of range And movement to Kate’s right
distracts her-

WHOOSH She lights up one wall as a Leg Centipede
skitters into the ventilation shaft near the ceiling

Beat Kate and Carter are the only ones left standing in
the room as it burns

Nearby Jonas lies dead on the floor
The fire in the room starts to spread
KATE
We don’t have much time before

this whole place is burning

CARTER
Let it burn

KATE
We have to kill every part of that
thing We have to make sure

Beat Carter nods

EXT THULE STATION — NIGHT
The snowstorm wages war on the landscape

From a high angle smoke rises from the facility and
dissipates into the wind and the snow

A flare of fire bursts through the roof of one corner
The lights throughout the facility suddenly power down

The entire camp goes dark

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER

Kate and Carter move cautiously down the hall Carter
carries his flamethrower over his shoulder

The lights wink off and they are plunged into darkness

Behind them the crackling fire in the rear entrance
offers wan light into the hallway

KATE
How many are left The arms and
legs split off-—

CARTER
Don’t know Where did the big one
go

KATE

Sander ran off

CARTER
Jameson is around somewhere

They pass by the radio room the glass of the interior
window dark on their right

INT THULE STATION RADIO ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Sander hides behind the desk in the middle of this room
The wan light from the hall casts shadows as someone
walks past

Beat They’re gone Then a SKITTERING sound

Something MOVES along the inside of the window One of
the centipedes It’s in the room

Sander peers around the desk searching

Slowly cautiously Sander gets up trying to watch the
whole room at once

He begins to back for the door behind him

CLOSE ON HIS FOOT as it missteps on the leg of a chair--
Sander nearly falls backward but regains his balance
More SKITTERING in the room--

A glimpse of something under the desk--

Sander backs up to the large radio DESK by the door his
hand searching for a potential weapon

He finds one Carters SCREWDRIVER left on the desk

Holding it like a shiv Sander finds the doorknob behind
him with his other hand

Quietly he turns the knob and pushes the door open
Still focused on the radio room before him

On the wall behind him ANOTHER CENTIPEDE CREATURE
dangling by the door ready for him It CHITTERS--

Sander whirls around to face it-—

The Centipede LEAPS onto Sander’s neck--

INT THULE STATION HALLWAY CONTINUOUS
From somewhere in the belly of the facility the sound of
Sander SCREAMING Kate and Carter react amid more
emergency bulbs in the hall
KATE
Sander
INT THULE STATION MED LAB CONTINUOUS
Colin leans against the scorched door to the lab

The SCREAM sounds slightly more muted here

Thinking quickly Colin pushes some equipment in front of
the door to barricade it (Reference JC movie)

He digs in his pockets for something he stowed earlier

The SHAVING STRAIGHT-RAZOR It glints in the near-dark

INT THOLE STATION HALLWAY — CONTINUOUS
Kate and Carter prowl the hall

KATE
Sounded like he was behind us
Maybe the radio room I don’t
know

Carter gets to a closet door Tries it Locked

Shoulders into it It won’t budge He spies the broken
firehose rack on the wall the fire axe still in place

He uses his elbow to break the glass and reaches for the
axe Some of the glass cuts his hands as he clears it
away (note to match bloodstain on axe handle later)

Carter uses the axe to sever the doorknob in one clean
stroke and yanks out the deadbolt

Opening the door to reveal a JANITORIAL CLOSET of
cleaning supplies
Carter finds two FLASHLIGHTS and hands one to Kate

CARTER
Damnit No kerosene

He steps out and moves down the hall to the next door
This is the LAB He reaches for the knob

Something in the darkness skitters

He stops Carter and Kate for signs of movement

Her attention drawn behind him as she sees-

An ARM CENTIPEDE crawling down the door from the ceiling--

CARTER whirls around as the Centipede braces itself
against the frame to lash out-

THE PALM of its hand is now an alien MOUTH the thing
itself only vaguely resembling Edvards arm now--

Carter raises the axe and CHOPS at the creature--

SPLITTING IT in half both halves dropping to the floor--

INT MED LAB CONTINUOUS

Colin jumps as the blade of the axe pierces the door

INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

The two halves of the Centipede creature begin to MERGE
back to one single creature on the floor--

CARTER
Hurry hurry-

KATE
Back off

Carter leaves the axe in the wall and stands back as Kate
lets out a spray of fire from her flame unit WHOOSH

Now small sections of the hallway are burning
CARTER

We have to go back This way is
blocked now

Kate takes two steps back the way they came and turns
back to speak with Carter--

KATE
The garage should have more ker--

BOOM Bursting through the cheap wood door to the bunk
bed room and into the hall between Kate and Carter is
EDVARDTHING

In the shadowy darkness it lets out a HOWL-

Kate and Carter are now on either side of this creature
Kate is partially under debris of the door

Edvard-Thing sees Carter Its head is now a twisted
merging of Edvard and Adam sharing one mouth

It starts toward him

Carter looks for an escape and dashes into the kitchen
Edvard-Thing advances down the hall in pursuit
Arriving at the open doorway to the kitchendining area

The place is still damaged from where Juliette was
burned

Edvard-Thing takes a step inside

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Another open door at the far end leads to a food stock
room

Edvard-Thing regards it cautiously But does not move
ANGLE ON the kitchen counter nearby
Carter hides here his flamethrower back in his grip

Checks the fuel level Nearly empty

INT MED LAB CONTINUOUS
Colin finally frees one of his arms from the ropes
Immediately he starts to work on the other arm

Then he hears something in the room with him A
shuffling sound Above

Colin slowly looks up

A Leg-Centipede creature that detached from Edvard-Thing
is on the ceiling half-dangling so its foot-shaped head
hovers a few feet away

Five eyes on stalks that were once toes stares at him

Colin holds his breath Then trembling

COLIN
You‘re not gonna get me

Colin raises the bloody razor to his own neck

COLIN (CONTD)
Not like that

The Leg-Thing opens its malformed mouth

INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS
Edvard-Thing advances to the stock room door

It comes into full view for Carter crouched between the
counter and the refrigerator

CARTER
Cheating bastard

Edvard-Thing SCREECHES and charges for Carter--
When WHOOSH It gets a face full of fire from-

KATE who has stepped into the kitchen and lit up the
beast with her own flame unit

Carter DIVES over the counter as Edvard-Thing flails
about engulfed in fire--

In primal panic the creature dashes and bursts right
THROUGH an exterior wall out into the snow--

Tripping on its own burning limbs and falling--

Kate and Carter follow it outside to finish the job

EXT THULE STATION — CONTINUOUS

WHOOSH Kate burns it again
99

Finally the cooked beast with its two faces (Adam and
Edvard) stops flailing and screeching NOTE This is the
charred corpse that MacReady later brings to Outpost 31

Behind them more of the facility goes up in flames The
fire has spread in so many sections it has penetrated
the roof

KATE
Are you okay

CARTER
I‘m good Thanks

Carter starts walking Kate follows him They cross the
camp and are getting near the garage

KATE
Where are you going

CARTER
We are getting out of here Seen
enough of this place

KATE
What do you mean how

CARTER
L rigged one of the Sprytes

KATE
What We can’t leave yetwe
havent killed all of it

Closer to the garage

Something distracts Carter and sees--

A FIGURE running away from the garage in the snow A
moment later and the snowstorm swallows him up

Visibility too low to track him farther from here

KATE (CONTD)
Who was that

CARTER
I don’t give a shit Let him
freeze Were getting out of here

INT VEHICLE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
The light of the fire casts shadows on the Spryte sitting

before the open door This is the vehicle that’s been
repaired

Carter walks up to it Sees the side door open He raises
his arm

CARTER
Careful

They slowly approach the Spryte Kate has her
flamethrower ready

They look inside and seeJameson on the backseat
slumped over his face not visible His arms cradling
something against his stomach

They climb inside and Carter gently pushes his friend
backwards

Reveal Jameson has holes in his face and neck Blood
everywhere The Thing had been working him but it didn’t
finish the job

CARTER (CONTD)
Oh Jesus

Jameson makes some faint sounds his eyes pleading and
his body wracked in unbearable pain He tries to say
something

JAMESON
It was Sander

Carter nods Jameson opens his arms Clusters of
dynamite some fall to the floor a sparker among them
Jameson was well prepared Just not quite enough

JAMESON (CONT’D)
Don‘t tell me I’m fine

Carter looks at him

JAMESON (CONTD)
Do it

He knows he has to kill his friend to take him out of
his misery Kate puts a hand on his shoulder

CARTER
I’m okay

But he is not Jameson smiles faintly at him Carter
tries to smile back

Then in a sudden movement raises his pistol and fires

BAM
Jameson’s head slams backwards

INT VEHICLE GARAGE — MOMENTS LATER
Carter gently puts Jameson on the garage floor

KATE
We have to get Sander

CARTER
Why There is nowhere to go The
nearest camp is hundreds of miles
from here It’ll never make it

KATE
It’s not going to any camp
Carter looks at her Kate looks serious

CARTER
Fuck

EXT VEHICLE GARAGE

The Spryte lurches out of the garage and pulls around to
head off in the direction of the crash site

High angle as it leaves the burning base

INT SPRYTE - NIGHT

Carter driving fast his face close to windshield Trying
to see the path through the heavy snow Kate in the back
gathering all the dynamite that Jameson left behind She
dumps some of it on the front seat and climbing back
stuffs the rest of it in her coateverywhere Then
climbs back into the front
KATE

Its likely that it knows how to

fly the ship Can you imagine what

happens if this saucer crashes on

any major city

She has a point

EXT PATH TO CRASH SITE — NIGHT

The Spryte driving as fast as possible in the snow

Half buried the flags mark the trail to the site

EXT CRASH SITE - NIGHT
Draped in snow Dark No lights left on

The entire site is just a massive dark blemish under the
ley surface

The Spryte slows to a stop Carter and Kate get out Kate
stuffs the last dynamite sticks in her vest

A low reverberating HUM hits them like a massive
soundwave cranked at top volume from a mile away

A series of lights fade up from the buried spacecraft
The lights mark a ring around the outside edges and
spotlight the main hatchway

The ship is slowly powering up

They move towards the crevasse

INT ALIEN SHIP HATCH ROOM MOMENTS LATER

Kate lands on the floor

All around the ship’s walls pulsate with light
temporarily illuminating the inside before dropping back
to darkness Making it hard to focus

The low rumble vibrates the floor

Quickly Carter arms his flamethrower

Overhead the cracking of ice--

And a massive whiteblue CHUNK slams over the open
hatchway Blocking them in

They press forward down the same tunnel system Kate
explored the first time they descended
INT ALIEN SHIP NARROW CORRIDOR CONTINUOUS

Unknown light sources flare up to an impossible bright
ripple along the tunnel walls

The two carefully move along this new corridor Searching
for the Thing The rumblings continue

Now a different sound of something MOVING down a hall
Coming for them

They freeze Listen It stops

Carter eases forward and crouches at the edge of an
opening Peeking slowly

CARTER POV

Darkness Then a ripple of light travels through the
walls illuminating

A barren floor And things dangling from the ceiling
Tendrils or maybe loose wiring And other shapes in the
ceiling bumps and knobs

The overall effect The ceiling seems to be closing in
Large clusters of the tendrils span the height of the
room forming columns or “trees” Obscuring the real size
of the room

ON CARTER looking back at Kate He signals for her to
wait Then he rounds the corner flamethrower at the
ready

INT ALIEN SHIP “WIRES” ROOM — CONTINUOUS

Carter quickly moves to the center of this room

The dangling forest overhead seems to twitch

Light ripples past him along the walls

As it does so-- a SHADOW on one wall reveals Carter’s
silhouette

Carter reaches into a pocket and pulls out a small FLARE
He cracks it open and drops it at his feet

Carter turns around to say something to Kate -- the
bright orange light of the flare at his feet suddenly
dissipates and goes dark

THE FLOOR opens around his feet as though a missile
silo cover is arming

He FALLS into further darkness-—

KATE
Carter

She launches herself into the room after him--
104

The cover begins to cloge- the hole shrinking back until
it is no bigger than a dinner plate-

And Kate reaches the hole peering down

KATE (CONTD)
Ccarter

CARTER (0S)
(muted)
I’m okay

She shines her flashlight down into the darkened chamber
She looks for him

CARTER (CONT ’D)
Its my ankle
(beat)
There’s another hatch down here
KATE
Alright I’1ll find it

Kate heads off Nothing but tree-trunks of alien wires
The veins inside the ship’s body Now the pods on the
wall begin to emanate light

INT THE POD ROOM — CONTINUOUS

ON KATE moving swiftly between columns beneath the pods
and then once again into the darkness

Kate keeps looking for a way down Another hole or hatch
in the floor She yells out to Carter

INT ALIEN SHIP CORRIDORS SERIES OF SHOTS

1) Kate arrives at an intersection

2) Kate takes a side tunnel The lights pulse around her
Kate turns a corner to enter

The PILOT’S STATION a circular room with a complex
almost cage-like cockpit

The Thing in full alien form is powering up the ship

It turns slowly to Kate menacing

INT ALIEN SHIP CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Kate frantically pulls out the dynamite This is all she

has for a weapon now She pulls out the sparker and tries
to ignite it Its wet and does not light

INT ALIEN SHIP CONTROL ROOM — CONTINUOUS
Kate holds up the dynamite

KATE
Get back

It watches her One head tilting
Desperately she sparks it

From the other side of the room CARTER appears his
flamethrower ready

Kate looks to him unsure if he’s friend or foe

CARTER
Kate Get out of there
KATE
Burn it
The lighter sparks
CARTER

No no--

The Thing SCREECHES at Kate

Carter TORCHES it The creature flails and spasms
struggling to get out of the cockpit

CARTER (CONT’D)
Stop the fuse

KATE
RUNI

Kate instead THROWS the dynamite at the monster in the
room

Carter runs from the room Kate follows

INT ALIEN SHIP CORRIDOR — MOMENTS LATER

Rounding the corner Kate runs full-tilt--catching up to
Carter

BOOOOM

From the depths of the ship a firecloud Kate and Carter
are knocked off their feet

Kate gets up and tries to start running--

A secondary explosion SHAKES the whole ship--

EXT CRASH SITE — CONTINUOUS
The ship falls like a rock back to its excavation site-

The lights all fade to darkness and the rumbling goes
quiet-

Steam and smoke rise from the skin of the ship

And finally it rests back in its crash-land spot from
thousands of years ago Only now the heat from the
underbelly of the ship has melted enough ice for it to
sit lower than before

As another smaller explosion rumbles within

ANGLE ON THE TOP HATCH

A long beat

It opens up belching more smoke

And Kate climbs out She coughs and rolls out of the
hatch But she’s alive

A moment later Carter climbs up after her He collapses
nearby in similar condition

The two make eye contact in the morning light

CARTER
You blew it up

KATE
Yeah

CARTER

What happened to preserving the
greatest discovery in science

Kate shakes her head slowly She’s punch-tired and
flooded with relief at surviving Grinning

KATE
Fuck science

Carter grins back
Kate then stares up into the sky--

PRE-LAP the sound of a helicopter as we cut to

EXT THULE STATION — MORNING
The burned remains of the camp still crackle with fire

The helicopter lands On its side the NORJ callsign
This is the Norwegian pilot and chopper

Stepping onto the snow and raising his goggles MATIAS
Tall Headstrong

Matias looks around at the remains of his country’s base
He ventures in farther toward the main building

Matias steps up to the charred remains of the TWO-HEADED
CORPSE (the one brought back to Outpost 31 in JC’s film)

A single GUNSHOT rings out
Matias hits the deck looking around to discover-
LARS stepping out of the generator room with a rifle
MATIAS (CONT’D)
(in Norwegian)
Lars What the hell--
LARS
(in Norwegian)
Stay where you are

Lars approaches cautiously

Matias slowly gets up again arms raised Not sure what
to say or do at the moment
MATTIAS
Lars

LARS
(in Norwegian)
Show me your teeth

MATIAS
(in Norwegian)
What
LARS
(in Norwegian)
Open

Matias obeys

On Lars squinting Then visibly relieved

Matias closes up still utterly confused
MATIAS

(in Norwegian)
What happened

Before Lars can start the sound of something bursting

out of a door distracts him

Nearby a HUSKY flees from the main building dashing

over the snow toward the helicopter
Lars gasps and raises his rifle--
LARS
(in Norwegian)
Don’t let it get away
A gunshot pocks the snow near the husky’s paws
Lars aims for another round-—
Matias pushes the gun down causing Lars to miss
MATIAS
(in Norwegian)

That’s one of Henrik’s dogs

The husky changes course away from the helicopter
into the open snow

Lars reloads his rifle--
LARS

(in Norwegian)
Thats no dog

out

Lars hurries for the helicopter

Matias stands a beat still in shock

He looks back down at the burned corpse a twisted
amalgam of two men and one part canine plus who knows
what else

Matias backs away then turns and runs to catch up with
Lars who is waving him to the helicopter

EXT CRASH SITE — MORNING

The Spryte sits parked in the snow

Kate and Carter approach it Kate rests for a beat
against the open passenger door Carter wearily takes off
the flamethrower and drops it in the snow Then goes
around to the driver side of the Spryte and climbs in
INT SPRYTE - CONTINUOUS

Kate stands at the door staring at him

CARTER
Come on Lets go

Kate walks back and picks up the flamethrower
CARTER (CONT ‘D)
Leave it We don’t need that thing

anymore

KATE
You never know

Now at the passenger door Carter again

CARTER
Get in Kate

ON KATE shaking her head
KATE
Did I tell you how I knew you were

human when you showed up at base

CARTER
No

KATE
Your earring Metal in a piercing
Carter stops Puts a hand to his ear

Long beat

KATE (CONT’D)
It was your other ear

CARTER
Kate-- hang on let me explain--

Carter’s FACE starts to ELONGATE--
Kate squeezes the trigger on the flamethrower-
WIDE ANGLE

A roar of gas and the fierce blaze engulfs Carter and
the interior of the Spryte at the same time

The burning Carter-Thing SCREECHES in agony claws at the
flames and struggles to get out to get to Kate The
sound echoes a dozen times across the open tundra

She kicks the door closed in his burning face

ON KATE staring at the burning Spryte and the mangled
destroyed remainder of Carter

Now she is truly alone And truly hopeless

Kate looks around at the miles of tundra The smoking
alien craft in its giant grave And nothing else

Kate begins marching back toward Thule Station
RISING to the sky and the morning sun and--

FADE OUT
