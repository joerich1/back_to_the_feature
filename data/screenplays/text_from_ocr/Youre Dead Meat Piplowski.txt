their owners cuddle them and don’t
make ‘em work for food or
affection We’re essentially dogs

KEVIN (CONTD)
If we don’t work I mean really
work use our bodies hunt fight
for survival then we go crazy

of saying to a dude “You are such
a fuckin’ pussy that I don’t want
you to create more fuckin’ pussies
such as yourself” It’s brilliant

Ray didn’t start wearing makeup

Wally hangs up

KEVIN
There is something liberating about
wearing a dress

WALLY
I wouldn’t know

A pair of GOONS carry a GUY with an ARROW through his chest
They go straight in

RAY
Where are we

Wally notices that the TV in the corner is playing the VIRGIL
STARKWELL episode of the AMERICA’S MOST WANTED-type show He
tenses

KEVIN
If Archie dies you think they can
press charges against me

Wally breaks his gaze from the TV

WALLY
Let’s hope he doesn’t die

CINDY SALINGER (30ish)

-- enters She’s an attractive blonde and the blood-soaked
head doctor of this underground clinic

CINDY

who brought in the old man with the
gunshot wound to his buttocks

CINDY
You should probably leave town Or
hire a good attorney We have
business cards on the counter

KEVIN
He died

CINDY
He was quite old I did the best I
could I’m sorry

She tries to keep a straight face then LAUGHS

INT ARCHIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

To call it a “dump” would offend your local dump Archie
pours tall glasses of Cutty Sark passes them out Ray sips
and gags

ARCHIE
I figured if a shithead like Zane
the Bounty Hunter can get a book
deal I can too My life story is
a helluva lot more interesting than
his

WALLY
You wrote a book

ARCHIE
More like an outline I’d need a
ghostwriter or something Shoulda
done it when I was younger but I
wasn’t into the whole marketing and
business thing Now I’m on death’s
door and nobodys interested

WALLY
I’m interested

RAY
Me too

KEVIN

If you did an audio book Id check
it out but I don’t have time to
read

ARCHIE
Catching Starkwell should help me
get this thing off the ground And
pay for my funeral

RAY
Sounds like a plan

ARCHIE
Tomorrow it’s for real Once you
go through that door there’s no
turning back
Archie gulps his drink

ARCHIE
Get some rest

He hobbles to his bedroom Wally and the guys look at each
other deadly sober

The gang sits around a table Archie sets a STUN GUN
RETRACTABLE POLICE BATON and PEPPER SPRAY in front of them

the target and get home safely If
that means putting a charge into a
fella blinding him with some
pepper spray or beating him like a
pinata well he shoulda
cooperated

Archie holds up a WANTED POSTER An EASTERN EUROPEAN THUG
(40s) stares back at them

ARCHIE
This is Dragan Mocacevic

EXT CITY STREET - DAY

The guys stand at the back of the van Archie puts BRICKS in
a TV box Wally Ray and Kevin wear baggy TV CITY shirts that
barely conceal the handcuffs batons and pepper spray on
their utility belts

ARCHIE
Lesson number one in fugitive
apprehension is using the element
of surprise You grab your target
kick him in the balls and have him
cuffed before he knows what the
fuck is happening

WALLY
Are we just gonna barge in there
without a warrant

ARCHIE
Bounty hunters don’t make arrests
We don’t worry about how we find
these shitbirds They’re guilty We
grab ‘em turn ‘em over to the
authorities and collect our dough

RAY
Do I have time to go to the
bathroom

Archie glares at him

RAY

fat mouth of yours if you don’t
stop asking questions and go get
your target

ARCHIE
I can do without the musical
accompaniment Miss Streisand

RAY

Archie examines the pages he gets misty-eyed

ARCHIE
This is my life I don’t have
snapshots from birthday parties and
Christmas mornings I was too busy
chasing monsters Linda raised the
kids none of ‘em talk to me
anymore Never even met my
grandchildren

WALLY
Now you have a second chance

triple bypass

WALLY
These days it’s like getting your
tonsils out

ARCHIE
I’m sorry I let you down

WALLY
That’s crazy talk You’ve got us
headed in the right direction

ARCHIE
You’re not ready to go after a guy
like Starkwell on your own

WALLY
We don’t have a choice

RAY
If Archie doesn’t think we should
do it

WALLY

My life so far is a complete
failure and catching Virgil is my
shot at redemption I’1l1 go alone
if I have to

KEVIN
Bro you’re not gonna be alone

Kevin puts a hand on Wally’s wounded shoulder Wally cringes

KEVIN
Sorry dude

He switches to the other shoulder All eyes on Ray He hems
and haws

KEVIN
Ray-Ray what would Jon Bon Jovi
do

RAY

He’d hunt down Virgil and write a
hit song about it

Ray extends his hand to Wally

RAY
Let’s get the motherfucker

Wally takes his hand Kevin hugs them both

ARCHIE
When you’re done with your little
orgy I got an old friend at the
Bureau He can give you all the
information they have on Starkwell
He likes scotch By the case

WALLY
Thanks Arch

ARCHIE
I want you to take my jacket

He nods toward the black leather jacket in the closet

WALLY
I can’t

ARCHIE
It’ll make you look tough Had it
for thirty years and it’s been damn
lucky

Wally puts it on It does make him look tough

WALLY
I’m just borrowing it

The guys shake Archie’s hand and start for the door

WALLY
Arch I called Linda She’s
outside

ARCHIE
Why’d she waste her time coming
here

Linda stands in the doorway

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

A sedan parks beside Ray’s van Kevin opens the back of the

An FBI AGENT Archie’s contact pops the trunk They swap the
scotch for boxes of FILES

FBI AGENT
You better move fast on Starkwell
He’s stayed free this long because
he’s always on the move Wherever
he is he’ll be gone with the wind
in less than a week

INT ARCHIE’S APARTMENT - DAY

The guys gather around the table the files are piled high

WALLY
The Virgil Starkwell we knew is a
choir boy in comparison to what
he’s become He’s spent half his
adult life behind bars and in that
time he’s built up a network of
underworld connections across the
country For the right price he’1ll
extort steal kidnap or kill
About five years ago he got into a
beef with some Tijuana gangsters
over a drug deal They sent a crew
of ex-cons to assassinate him
Virgil mailed a different body part
back to the bosses every day for a
year

KEVIN
Fuck the postage on that must have
been ridiculous

RAY
I guess we got off easy

WALLY
The FBI analysis is that he’s lying
low and trying to put together a
big score Something that will get
him out of the country and buy his
way to freedom in a non-extradition
country So like the G-Man said
the clock’s ticking Virgil works
with a crew They’ve been together
for years

Wally holds up a mug shot of CHANG a nightmare

WALLY
Eugene Chang is an ex-Green Beret
who went to work for the Medillin
drug cartel He and Virgil formed a
mutual admiration society after a
near death experience

FLASHBACK
A prison cell Chang wraps PIANO WIRE around Virgil’s neck
it’s a bloody knock down drag out fight that ends in a draw

Both men are exhausted They grin

Wally lifts another mug shot KENDALL TURNER a
behemoth

WALLY
This is Kendall Turner He looks
familiar because he used to play
for the Oakland Raiders

FLASHBACK
Turner viciously sacks a variety of quarterbacks

WALLY
When he wasn’t breaking
quarterbacks in half Turner
financed a drug dealer from his old
neighborhood Things were good
until his business partner caught a
murder charge and gave him up

FLASHBACK

Turner enters the prison yard and gets attacked by ARYAN GANG
MEMBERS He’s tough as nails but overmatched Virgil and
Chang step in kick ass and give him a hand up

Wally holds up a mug shot of ANNA PAVLICHENKO (20s) A
sneering punk rock beauty

WALLY
Last but not least is Anna
Pavlichenko Her father was a
decorated Red Army sniper When the
Iron Curtain fell he went to work
for the highest bidder

FLASHBACK

Bosnia Anna 10 serves as the SPOTTER for her FATHER as he
takes out ENEMIES by the bushel

WALLY (VO)
The apple didn’t fall far from the
tree

A sniper battle across a bombed out town Anna’s father
catches a bullet between the eyes

Unfazed Anna picks up his rifle waits patiently for her
FATHER’S KILLER to come down from his perch and drops him
with a single shot

WALLY
She was found by UN Forces and
relocated to Brooklyn where she
lived with relatives And
continued the family business

FLASHBACK

Anna 15 perches in an abandoned warehouse and plies her
trade on unwitting CRIMINAL TARGETS down below

WALLY
She hooked up with Virgil a few
years back
FLASHBACK
Virgil and Anna lock eyes at a bar
SECONDS LATER -- she’s tearing his clothes off
WALLY
Anna is Virgil’s eye in the sky If
she sees something she doesn’t
like she shoots it
Ray buries his head in his hands Kevin takes Anna’s photo
KEVIN
Can I keep this Or do you have a

better one

WALLY

Melvin struggles to break free Ray grabs an empty beer
bottle and breaks it on Melvin’s head

KEVIN

RAY
Doesn’t feel so good does it

WALLY
How can we find Virgil Starkwell
Melvin tries to spit at Wally doesn’t have enough breath

WALLY
I think he needs some air

Kevin throws him through a screen door and onto the balcony
He hoists Melvin up by his ankles and holds him over the
edge It’s three stories down

KEVIN
How’s this

WALLY
Better than I expected
(to Melvin)
When was the last time you saw him

MELVIN
It was a year and a half ago He
said he was going to Colorado to
visit a guy named Bill Bonner

CARTER
You sure you wanna be messing with

We know what we’re doing

CARTER
(points to map)
We can touch down here and it’s a

him into the night

WALLY

Carter waves off his concern with a LAUGH --

Wally nods and dives out of the plane

EXT SKY - NIGHT

Wally free-falls He pulls the chute WHOOMP It deploys
For a moment it’s peaceful

KEVIN (0S)

Kevin waves he’s a few hundred feet below

WALLY

KEVIN
Over there

Wally looks towards the horizon Before he sees Ray’s
parachute he hears Ray’s high-pitched SCREAMS

WALLY
Did Carter bail out

KEVIN
Yeah He--

BULLETS rip through their parachutes

WALLY
Jesus Christ

They fall faster Kevin draws his GUN and returns FIRE

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT

Ray CRASHES in a heap ROLLS until he comes to a stop on a
big rock

Fifty yards away Wally touches down almost on his feet his
momentum taking him toward a cliff

WALLY
Stop Stop Stop

He can’t brake and goes over the edge

The parachute catches on a dead tree Wally dangles over a
five hundred foot drop

WALLY
Help Ray

Ray hears Wally and staggers toward his shrieks He sees the
parachute follows it over to the edge sees Wally and
SCREAMS Wally SCREAMS in return

RAY
Wally man you just relax and I’1l
just relax and once Kevin gets
here we’ll pull you up
The parachute gives and Wally DROPS another five feet

WALLY
Ray you have to pull me up now

The dead tree is coming up from its roots

RAY
OK OK I’m gonna start pulling

WALLY
Yes Start pulling

The tree SNAPS and the parachute slides toward the
precipice Ray dives grabbing the chute by his fingertips

Wally SLAMS up against the jagged rocks Ray HOLDS ON for
dear life

RAY
I’m gonna save you man I’m not
gonna let you plummet to your death
and die alone in some dark crevice

Ray digs in strains

RAY
(sings)
“I guess this time you’re really
leaving
I heard your suitcase say
goodbye”

Ray continues singing Bon Jovi’s “Ill Be There For You” It
gives him strength He’s starting to pull Wally up

Wally joins in and sings too They’re making progress The
singing gets stronger Wally’s almost up

The hunter who fired the Stinger creeps up behind Ray and
raises a SHOTGUN

The hunter nearly pulls the trigger but stops and listens
to the song watching Ray The hunter lowers the rifle

Ray reaches over grabs Wally’s hand and hoists him up They
hug exhausted

BILL BONNER a grizzly former academic and two more
HUNTERS join the first

They have Kevin - his hands are tied behind his back

Noticing they have company Wally and Ray break their embrace
and raise their hands

KEVIN
Sorry I got captured dudes I
landed right in their fuckin’ laps

Bonner cracks Kevin in the face with his rifle - he drops
like a sack of potatoes Bonner stands over Wally and Ray

BONNER
When I’m through with you rats
falling off a cliff to your death
is gonna seem like a bubble bath

He smashes them in the face with the butt end of his rifle

INT DUNGEON - NIGHT

Wally lies on the floor unconscious He gets doused with a
BUCKET OF WATER and wakes up his feet and arms chained to
the wall He sees Ray and Kevin across the room chained up
and soaking

Bonner hands the bucket to the hunter in camouflage who’s
focused on Ray

BONNER
Are you maggots FBI CIA KGB

WALLY
We’re tourists

BONNER
You know what I do to smart alecks
I cut out their tongues

Bonner unsheathes a BOWIE KNIFE grabs Wally by the face

WALLY
Okay fine We’re bounty hunters

Bonner grins scrapes the blade along Wally’s cheek

BONNER
What’s the reward up to these days
for the capture of the most
dangerous man in America

WALLY
Are you referring to yourself

Bonner glares at him
WALLY

(lies)
A hundred million dollars

BONNER
That’s got to be the biggest bounty
ever

WALLY

By far They’re only offering a
million for Virgil Starkwell

BONNER
That’s because Starkwell’s a punk
without any beliefs or convictions
You can’t compare a common criminal
to a revolutionary

WALLY
We would never be so presumptuous
as to think that we could capture
the great Bill Bonner It would be
like catching a unicorn We came
here seeking your counsel We’re
after Starkwell

BONNER
I tried to help that boy see the
light but he’s too far gone What
a waste

WALLY
So youll help us

BONNER
As much as I despise a perverted
cretin like Starkwell he’s a
necessary pawn in this war You
people on the other hand are the
enemy And I don’t have any use for
prisoners Enjoy the last night of
your lives bounty hunters I
sentence you to death by firing
squad at dawn

Bonner storms out but the hunter lingers for a moment
BONNER
(to hunter)
Let’s go

The hunter snaps out of it follows him and shuts the door

RAY
Death by firing squad

WALLY
It could be worse

RAY
That’s not comforting

KEVIN
Maybe Carter will rescue us

RAY
Were dead
(to Wally)
And it’s all your fault
(MORE)
RAY (CONTD)
This whole idea of becoming bounty
hunters and catching Virgil is
easily the worst idea youve ever
had And you’ve had a ton of awful
ideas

WALLY
At least I didn’t devote my life to
pretending to be Jon Bon Jovi

RAY
I love playing music and making
people happy What joy do you bring
to the world

KEVIN
Dudes c’mon

WALLY
You got the same tattoo as the guy
And what about your chin If Bon
Jovi ever heard about you and your
obsession he’d get a restraining
order We’re about to die Ray why
don’t you just admit that you’re
too chicken shit to be yourself
Youve written a thousand songs
over the years and I’ve never
heard you play one of them in
public

RAY
They’re not ready

KEVIN
They’re ready Ray-Ray Promise me
when we get back to Jersey you’re
gonna play them

RAY
Earth to Kevin there’s no way
were getting outta here

KEVIN
Oh yeah Watch this

Kevin uses every ounce of his being to try to break his
bonds GROANS GRUNTS HEAVES and succeeds in nearly
giving himself a stroke

KEVIN
(breathless)
OK we’re dead

RAY
(to Wally)
You know man you’re one to talk
What kind of example are you
setting for Patrick

WALLY
That’s low Ray Even for you

RAY
He must be so ashamed A man of
your age that can’t even hold a
steady job

WALLY
Maybe I’11 just grow my hair out
put on some makeup and sing

RAY
Your voice sucks

WALLY
At least my father didn’t fire me
because I was killing his business

The door opens The hunter walks in stops in front of Ray
reaches out with a gloved hand and touches his face

RAY
Oh hello

The hunter touches his hair smells him looks at his tattoo
and steps back Ray smiles weakly The hunter charges forward
and KISSES RAY ON THE LIPS

WALLY
(to Kevin)
They’re gonna rape us all night and
then shoot us

The Hunter removes the mask and hat Underneath it’s a WOMAN
and she’s gorgeous Her name is MARY (30ish)

KEVIN
She could rape and shoot me
anytime
Mary kisses Ray again
MARY
I love you Mr Bon Jovi I always

dreamed you’d come for me

She frees him from his shackles

KEVIN
(to Wally)
I think you owe my cousin an
apology

MARY
I’m Mary Can I call you “Jon”

RAY
Sure Mary you’re beautiful

MARY
You think so

RAY
(sings)
“What Id give to run my fingers
through your hair
Touch your lips to hold you
near”

She kisses him again

MARY
My stepfather hates your music He
made me throw away SLIPPERY WHEN
WET and NEW JERSEY when me and my
mom and my younger sisters moved
here back in 1989

She unlocks Wally and Kevin

MARY
But I knew all the songs by heart
so I wrote down the words and kept
them in a special place My sisters
and I sing your songs every day

She takes out a thick bundle of papers

MARY
I drew this picture of you from
memory The poster used to hang
above my bed back in Omaha

She shows him a SKETCH of the famous -- if you’re from New
Jersey anyway -- 1988 Bon Jovi Superman Tattoo POSTER It
does look like Ray

MARY
You were the last thing I saw
before I went to sleep

(MORE)

MARY (CONTD)
And this picture is still the last
thing I look at every night before
I close my eyes Now you’re here

The door opens ROSE and DARLA identical twins come in
giggling like school girls They’re tens They squeal when
they see Ray The women dance and scream

BONNER
(to Wally)

WALLY
Sorry to burst your bubble but
youre not the most wanted man in
America

BONNER
Liar Don’t try to torture me with
your falsehoods

WALLY
We don’t want you we want Virgil
Starkwell

BONNER

You’re a fool You’ve just made the
most glorious capture since
Napoleon surrendered at Waterloo
and you’d trade it for a bottom
feeder like Starkwell

The guys stare at him unmoved

BONNER
So if I tell you how to find
Starkwell you’1l let me be

WALLY
Sounds like a fair trade

BONNER
You need to talk to Slim Valentine
He’s Virgil’s fence He’1ll know how
to find Virgil

A dude that buys stolen property
from a criminal

banged have been nasty skanky
filthy whores with vaginas like
old catcher’s mitts This is very

worthy of the honor and privilege
of popping your cherries

The sisters stare at him tears rolling down their cheeks
