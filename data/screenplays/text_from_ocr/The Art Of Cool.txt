EXT HIGH SCHOOL - FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

Establishing shot of students milling about out front waiting
for the first period bell to ring

FLEE (VO)
Once upon right about now in a land
not very far away there is a tiny
kingdom known as Robert Frost High
Like all high schools it has its own
distinct and unique cliques and clans
six major ones to be exact

ANGLE ON THE GODS

The jocks and a few rich guys are huddled together Their
clothes are all stylish and expensive looking

FLEE (V0O)
The Gods Undisputed masters of our
small universe They are of course
the jocks cheerleaders rich
beautiful or any combination of the
above You know the type and most
likely You arent one

At the center of the group stands GEORGE BUFTON a tall
great looking guy Right beside him is DONALD “PSYCHO”
RUTLEDGE whos as massive and mean as they come

FLEE (VO) (contd)
Meet George Bufton a second
generation star quarterback prick
extraordinaire and the king of all he
surveys The monster next to him is
Donald “Psycho” Rutledge An all-state
free safety whos nickname pretty much
sums him up He’s the kind of guy who
puts the press in oppression

BUFTON
Im walking down the beach at our
summer house and I see a chick ina
wheelchair watching this amazing
sunset She looks depressed so I ask
her what’s wrong She says she’s sad
because she’s never been kissed Now
even though the chick’s a cripple
she’s super hot and I figure what the
hell and give her a nice long kiss

Several of the guys CHUCKLE

BUFTON (contd)
You think she’d be all smiles but no
The gimp seems even sadder and I’m
like what’s the deal

(MORE )
BUFTON (contd)
I gave you the old tongue tango She
says she knows it’s just no ones
ever screwed her

JOCK 1
Holy spam bra Whatd you do

BUFTON
I gently lifted her out of the
wheelchair and walked to the lakes
edge We locked eyes and then I flung
her into the air As she hit the water
I yelled “Now you’re screwed”

All the guys burst out LAUGHING

KERI (0S)
That better be a joke

All heads turn to see KERI KENT the prettiest girl in school
and her posse of cheerleaders walking towards the boys

BUFTON
You know it is baby doll

We kick into SLOW MOTION and absorb every detail of Keri

FLEE (V0O)

This vision of perfection is Bufton’s
queen Keri Kent Like all head
cheerleaders her first and last name
begin with the same letter Boy what
I wouldn’t give to see her twinkle

Back to real time Keri walks up and Bufton kisses her
passionately - the kind that screams “Get a room” Bufton
starts to grope her ass but she slaps his hands away

KERI
Control yourself
BUFTON
You’re so hot it’s hard And I’m not

talking about controlling myself

Keri smiles and they start to kiss again but Psycho breaks it
up by tapping Bufton on the shoulder

PSYCHO
Target acquired at nine oclock

Bufton sees something off screen and smiles

BUFTON
Down set

Psycho instantly gets into a three point stance

BUFTON (contd)
Hut hut sic

Psycho races off the screen at top speed
ANGLE ON THE GOTHS
A group of kids dressed in all black

FLEE (V0)
The Goths disciples of Marilyn Manson
and everything else that’s dark and
disturbing They’re all really weird
and coming from me that says a lot

All eyes in the group are focused on SHANNON BELL Her black
dyed hair is spiked out crazily and her face is hidden behind
several layers of caked on make-up and various piercings

FLEE (VO) (contd)
Shannon Bell is their high priestess
She‘s scary looking but every guy at
school fantasizes about her because
well she’s a really big slut I hear
freshman year she let the Bufton
brothers double team her Don’t know
what a double team entails exactly but
it sounds pretty darn slutty to me

BELL
In the dream I had last night the
entire world was on fire and burning
corpses ran through the streets

Bell let’s a SILENT pause hang in the air

GOTH 1
And

BELL
And we were cooking marshmallows

GOTH 1
Wicked

ANGLE ON THE GEARS
The auto-shop crowd Lots of denim and rock band t-shirts

FLEE (V0O)
The Gears are lovers of all things
metal music included They’re also
the only group the Gods give any
semblance of respect not that they
respect them it’s just that the last
war between the Gods and Gears was the
bloodiest in our kingdom’s history
The biggest and baddest of them is BRIAN RAINEY

FLEE (VO) (contd)
The tough looking guy there is Brian
Rainey and he’s the Gears head
mechanic Next to Psycho he’s the
most dangerous kid at school I know a
guy who knows a guy who knows for a
fact that Rainey stabbed a cop once

GEAR 1
Dude whats hotter a mint ‘69
Corvette or Jessica Biel
RAINEY
Depends if you want to get laid or go
driving
All the Gears LAUGH
ANGLE ON THE GEEKS
Nerd central and it’s a fashion nightmare

FLEE (VO)

The Geeks Possessors of the best
and brightest minds in the realm They
also possess a mathematically

impossible lack of fashion sense Not

that I know much about that myself

The geekiest of all is ALLISON WILLIAMS an Asian looking girl
wearing big glasses and frumpy unflattering clothes

FLEE (VO) (contd)
Behold nerdus maximus aka Allison
Williams The undisputed mental
heavyweight of our world She’s got a
mind as sharp as a knife anda
personality duller than a spoon

ALLISON
Ten Physics Club points to whomever
can answer this If you filled a pool
with melted dry ice could you swim in
it without getting wet

GEEK 1
No
ALLISON
Why
GEEK 1
(hesitatingly)

Because it has no liquid state
ALLISON
Correct Dry ice sublimates

ANGLE ON THE GET-BYS

The camera now floats past a thick layer of very average and
unexciting looking kids For the most part they’re all dressed
like the Gods but not quite as stylish

FLEE (VO)
Here we have the largest only
leaderless and least influential of
the tribes the Get-bys I dont know
what to say about them other than
They sort of just get by

ANGLE ON THE LOSERS

We are now clearly on the fringe of Frost High society and
what we see is not pretty

FLEE (VO)
Now for my personal favorite The
losers You know the spazes freaks
tards tweakers fatties Trekkies
band dorks AV clubbers booger
eaters etc We’re a pretty loose knit
group ‘Cuz hey even losers dont

like associating with losers

The camera tracks past examples of all the loser “types”
mentioned above and then pauses on NATALIE “FAT NAT” RODGERS
an overweight girl with a cute face

FLEE (VO) (contd)
The monstrosity you’re currently
gaping at is Natalie “Fat Nat”
Rodgers the school’s resident fat
girl She transferred here last year
and promptly told everyone she was
friends with the lead singer of “The
Killers” Yeah like that lie would
make people like her Pathetic

The camera continues its journey and finally stops on an empty
side field We hear what sounds like a young girl SCREAMING

Suddenly JAY “FLEE” ENTLICH small and weird for his age runs
onto the screen and away from the camera as fast as he can -
hes the one whos screaming

FLEE (VO) (contd)
(sighs)
Sadly that screaming little bitch is
me My name is Jay Entlich but
everyone calls me Flee and Im
officially the biggest loser of all
(MORE)

FLEE (V0) (contd)
Which I firmly disagree with as
theres at least two maybe three
other kids who are way more jank than
Me But what can you do

After a beat we see Psycho fly onto the screen Like a well
oiled machine he quickly catches up to Flee Psycho grabs and
then drags him kicking and screaming off screen

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

The entire student body has formed a huge ring around the
flagpole Psycho drags a still kicking and screaming Flee to
the pole where Bufton stands waiting

BUFTON
Thanks for stopping by Flee

FLEE
Why can’t you leave me alone

Bufton pretends like he’s thinking deeply

BUFTON
Uh because you’re a loser

Bufton nods his head and Psycho gives Flee an atomic wedgie
Psycho then ties Flee’s exposed underwear to the rope on the
flag pole Flee struggles to break free

PSYCHO
Calm down Youll only make it worse

FLEE
You calm down jerk-ass

BUFTON
Did the little faggot just say he
wanted his ass jerked

Bufton gives a nod and Psycho starts yanking the rope Flee
bounces up and down like a yo-yo

The crowd LAUGHS and Flee absolutely goes berserk It catches
Psycho off guard and Flee breaks free But he only makes it a
few feet before the slack on the flag rope runs out and snaps
him backwards to the ground - bringing more LAUGHTER

Psycho instantly picks Flee off the ground and holds him

BUFTON (contd)
Babes and Grommets I give you the
eleventh annual loser lynching Let‘s
have a kick ass year

With that Bufton kicks Flee in the ass and the crowd CHEERS
Psycho starts working the rope and Flee is quickly lifted off
the ground by his underwear

Flee unsuccessfully tries to untie his underwear and him
flailing around is comical The crowd can‘t help but LAUGH

FLEE
You better put me down right now or
I‘ll have my friend whos a thirteenth
degree black belt beat you up

BUFTON
I thought there were only ten degrees

FLEE
Yeah well he was taught an extra
secret three Ninja techniques

BUFTON
And I bet he lives next door to your
imaginary girlfriend

FLEE
My girlfriends not imaginary
shes She’s just away at college

BUFTON
Whatevs Grommet

Bufton pushes Flee’s dangling body which forces it to start
wrapping around the pole - like a tether ball

We hear a RIPPING sound as Flee’s underwear gives out and he
falls face first on the ground Which brings an explosion of
LAUGHTER from the crowd

BUFTON (contd)
God I love the sound of underwear
ripping in the morning Sounds like
victory

PSYCHO
That was dank bra

A school bell RINGS and everyone instantly heads to class
leaving Flee lying all alone on the ground

FLEE (VO)
Ah dookie not even ten seconds into
it and I can already tell it’s gonna
be the worst semester ever

After a beat SONNY SHUE cigarette in mouth walks up and
stands over Flee Sonny’s built lean but tough looking and has
a James Dean air about him - cool without effort

SONNY
A little piece of advice Where your
enemy is strong avoid him
Flee looks up at Sonny

FLEE
Am I supposed to know what that means

SONNY
Means you could’ve saved yourself the
humiliation if you’d only come to
school late today A demerit’s got to
be better than That

FLEE
Thanks but they just wouldve waited
until lunch to get me

Flee drops his head back down into the dirt Sonny takes a
drag off his cigarette then walks off

INT CLASSROOM - LATER

The period bell stops RINGING and everyone sits down A beat
later Sonny casually strolls in and takes a seat at the way
back Necks strain to check out the new kid but he just looks
forward as if he’s totally unaware of the attention

But then he slowly turns his head to gaze at Keri His stare
is so intense she starts to blush slightly They lock eyes for
a beat and he winks at her but before she can even react he

goes back to looking straight forward smooth as they come

INT BATHROOM - LATER

Bufton Psycho and several other Gods carry Flee in One of
them opens a bathroom stall door and they unceremoniously
stick Flee’s head into the toilet

INT TOILET — CONTINUOUS

Flee’s face is fully submerged and he looks directly at us We
hear the toilet flush and see the water swirl around his head
as it drains

FLEE (V0O)
Yeah so my life sort of sucks but I
try to look at it like this High
school is a lot like prison You do
your time make it out alive and then
you get a shot at a real life

INT CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Flee comes into the room late and takes a seat at the front
His hair is still soaking wet from the swirly Several Get-by
Guys point and LAUGH but Flee ignores it

EXT SONNYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sonny smokes a cigarette and stares at the night sky In the
driveway sits his car a sweet looking 1970 Pontiac GTO

FLEE (0S)
Will you teach me to smoke

Sonny nearly jumps out of his skin

SONNY
Christ you scared the shit out of me

Flee walks up to Sonny from out of the shadows

FLEE
Sorry I was taking the garbage out
and saw you and just thought I’d say
hey I’m Flee by the way

Flee holds his hand out and after a beat Sonny shakes it

SONNY
Sonny Shue
FLEE
So would you
SONNY
Would I what
FLEE
Teach me to smoke
SONNY
No Why would you even want to
FLEE
Because it looks dank
SONNY
Dank
FLEE

It’s what the Gods say when something
is cool ‘Cuz saying cool at our
school is jank Which means un-cool
Oh and a Grommet is a loser Not that
you’ll ever be called one

(beat)
What did your cool kids say for cool

SONNY
Cool
FLEE
How come you moved in with your
grandparents Didn‘t you like your old
school

Sonny doesn’t say anything just ashes his cigarette He takes
a new cig out and lights it with his Zippo in one cool quick
snap of the lighter Flee coughs from the smoke The boys sit
there in SILENCE until Flee can‘t take it anymore

FLEE (contd)
Hey you’re not by any chance a
thirteenth degree black belt

SONNY
There’s only ten degrees in Karate

FLEE
The last three are secret Ninja
techniques

SONNY
I never really got into the whole
martial arts thing

FLEE
Just checking But if anyone asks
r) would you mind telling them you are

Sonny looks over at Flee to see if he’s serious and he is

SONNY
Uh okay

FLEE
I wanted to take karate classes but
mom wouldnt let me She signed me up
for ballroom dancing instead I’m
pretty good but knowing the tango
doesn’t really help you in a fight
I’m pretty small too so maybe it
would be better if I had Jedi powers
Then I could mind trick the bullies
into beating each other up You ever
wish you had Jedi powers

SONNY
No but Im starting to

FLEE
I got a book on mind controlling other
people and sometimes I practice
Nothing’s happened yet but I’ve only
tried my powers on a neighbors dog
and maybe it’s impossible to mind
control a canine I could teach you
though if you want

Sonny turns and stares at Flee in awe

SONNY
You watch a lot of TV dont you

FLEE
I guess
(re Sonnys car)
Thats a pretty dank ride youve
got If you wanna carpool I could
help pay for gas

SONNY
Look kid you seem like a nice
person so don’t take this personally
but I’d just rather fly solo

Flee does his best to hide his disappointment
FLEE
I’m kind of a loner myself
(beat)
Well welcome to the neighborhood

SONNY
Thanks

Flee slips back into the darkness and Sonny shakes his head in
amazement
INT SONNY’S CAR - MORNING
Sonny drives to school and passes Flee riding his bike They
momentarily make eye contact and there’s a glimmer of hope on
Flee’s face but Sonny is stone

INT CAFETERIA FOOD LINE - LUNCH TIME

Flee grabs some tater tots and puts them on his tray He then
moves forward and grabs a hamburger

Bufton and crew suddenly come bursting into the line HOOTING
AND HOLLERING They are totally cutting and it clearly pisses
off a few of the students but no one dares say anything

Bufton pauses behind Fat Nat and makes pig noises The Gods
all LAUGH but she ignores it

Bufton moves on to Flee grabs the burger off his tray and
smacks the back of Flee’s head

BUFTON
Make sure you pay for that Grommet

Psycho reaches over Allison to grab some food

ALLISON
Salve Psycho

PSYCHO
What did you say Chinerd
(fake Chinese accent)
You want robster craws

The Gods LAUGH and then they’re gone as fast as they came

ALLISON SUBTITLE
Accipere quam facere praestat It is better to suffer an
injuriam injustice than to do an
injustice

INT BATHROOM — DAY

Keri and the cheerleaders check their make-up in the mirrors
Bell and a HOT GOTH GIRL enter

KERI
Well well if it isn’t the usual slut-
spects

BELL

Know how I tell when you’re saying
something stupid Your lips move

Keri gives Bell a hard stare then breaks into a big smile

KERI
Tell you what as it’s our senior
year why don’t we agree to be civil
Just keep your big gaping slutty
diseased cock-grinder away from my
man Not that he’d be interested
Buff doesn’t like tainted goods

BELL
If anythings rotten it’s you bitch

KERI
Wasn’t me who tore off my pants ten
seconds into their very first party
and screwed anyone whod have her

Bell releases a guttural SCREAM and lunges at Keri but Hot
Goth Girl grabs her and holds her back

KERI (contd)
God youre so Shannon Doherty

With that Keri and the cheerleaders walk out Hot Goth Girl
releases Bell who fights to not cry for a second then

BELL
(screams )
Stupid slag thinks she’s all that

INT CAR - NIGHT

FLEE’S MOTHER a tired looking but upbeat woman drives She
looks over and smiles lovingly at her son

FLEES MOTHER
So hows school going

FLEE
Great Best year ever so far

FLEES MOTHER
Got a special lady yet

FLEE
There’s a couple I like but it’s
pretty early on so Im keeping my
options open

Flees Mother smiles at her son
FLEES MOTHER

Well I hope they all know just how
amazing you are

Flee blushes and shrugs his shoulders In the distance we can
now see the glow of stadium lights

FLEES MOTHER
You sure you don’t want me to drop you
off at the stadium

FLEE

(frustrated)

Mom how many times do I have to tell
you it’s jank to be dropped off by
your mom

FLEES MOTHER
Okay okay

Flees Mother pulls over to the side of the road

FLEE’S MOTHER
See you back here in two hours

Flee nods his head and starts to get out of the car

FLEE’S MOTHER (contd)
Hey mister

Flee stops and kisses his mom goodbye

MONTAGE - FOOTBALL GAME

Bufton throws a perfect thirty yard pass for a touchdown The
crowd goes wild

A wide-receiver from the opposing teams jumps in the air and
catches a pass But before he lands Psycho comes flying in
from off screen and lands a hit so devastating it knocks the
receiver unconscious He hits the ground like a rag doll and
the football rolls out of his hands

Keri and her crew of cheerleaders dance provocatively - it’s
extremely sexy

The camera floats around the home team bleachers and we catch
glimpses of all six of the clans but not Flee Sonny we
notice is standing alone on the ground next to the bleachers -
smoking a cigarette

The opposing team blitzes but Bufton escapes the onslaught and
runs the ball in for a touchdown

An opposing team running back bursts through the Frost High
defense but before he gets even five yards Psycho crushes him
to the ground The running back lies there twitching

The cheerleaders whip the Frost students into a frenzy

The camera pans across to the opposing team’s bleachers and
pushes in to find Flee sitting by himself cheering Everyone
around Flee stares at him angrily

INT AUTO SHOP - MORNING

Rainey and the Gears tinker with a car while they wait for the
first period bell to ring

An expensive SUV covered in mud pulls into the garage Bufton
Psycho Keri and Cheerleader 1 pile out of the car

BUFTON
Yo Rainey shoulda seen it bra We
did some mega-dank off-roading this
weekend

RAINEY
Good for you man

BUF TON
How about doing me a solid and having
your boys clean her up during class

Bufton smiles takes a twenty out of his pocket and holds it
up After a beat Rainey nods his head and grabs the bill

BUFTON (contd)
Keys are inside and you rock

Bufton and Psycho put their arms around the girls and stroll
out Once theyre gone Gear 1 spits on the floor

GEAR 1
Shoulda knocked Bufton‘s block off

RAINEY
Don’t think Psycho wouldve taken too
kindly to that Besides twenty bones
is twenty bones and it ain’t like we
wont be working for his type our
whole crap-ass lives anyway

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - END OF DAY

Kids pour out of the school Flee walks up to a bike rack and
finds the wheels on his bike have been bent - making it
impossible to ride He kicks a tire in frustration

FLEE
(yells)
Freakin’ idiots

In the background we can see several of the Gods laughing
Flee unlocks the bike and starts dragging it home

EXT STEPHANIES HOUSE LATER

Flee knocks on the door and STEPHANIE SMITH an extremely
cute petite and tough looking nine year old answers it

STEPHANIE
Yes loser
FLEE
Can I maybe borrow your bike
STEPHANIE
Porquoi
FLEE

I was doing a 360 off this sweet jump
and bent my rims when I landed

STEPHANIE
Sucks to be you

FLEE
Come on just until I get mine fixed

Stephanie crosses her arms and stares at him for a beat

STEPHANIE
Swear to come to all my tea parties

FLEE
No way

Stephanie starts to close the door but Flee stops her

FLEE (contd)

Fine

INT STEPHANIES ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Flee sits in a ridiculously small chair at a equally small
table Several stuffed animals sit at the table with him while
Stephanie hosts an imaginary tea party She holds an empty
plate in front of Flee

STEPHANIE
Cookie
FLEE
(sighs)
Sure

Flee takes an imaginary cookie and pretends to eat it

FLEE (contd)
Yummy

STEPHANIE
I know I baked them myself

IE SONNY’S CAR - MORNING
Sonny drives to school He turns a bend and comes upon Flee

riding the cutest girliest little pink bike youve ever
seen Sonny pulls up beside him and rolls the window down

SONNY
What do you think youre doing
FLEE
Riding to school duh
SONNY
On a girls bike
FLEE
Mine‘s in the shop
SONNY
Then take the bus
FLEE
You take it
SONNY

Christ kid people pick on you enough
as is Being seen on that won‘t help

Flee gives Sonny an angry look speeds up and pulls away from
the car Sonny barely taps the gas and instantly catches up
SONNY (contd)
Whats your problem little man

FLEE
My problem is that some assholes broke
my bike so I have to ride a pink
piece of dookie because if I take the
bus I get beaten up by freshmen which
is even more humiliating than being
seen on this That’s my problem

Sonny starts to LAUGH and Flee gives him a look that could
kill Flee stands up on the pedals gives it everything he’s
got and pulls a few feet ahead of Sonnys car

Sonny guns the car shoots ten yards forward and cuts Flee
off Flee stops the bike and Sonny gets out of the car

SONNY
Is that why you sat in the visitor
section at the football game

FLEE
Yeah it’s safer

SONNY
Why even go then

FLEE
Theyre my team too

Sonny stares at Flee for a long moment

SONNY

Give me the bike and get in the car
FLEE

Really
SONNY

Hurry up before I change my mind

Flee smiles big hands Sonny his bike and races into the car
Sonny opens the trunk dumps the bike in and slams it shut

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

Sonny’s car pulls into the parking lot They get out and walk
toward the school All the students outside watch them

Flee walks with a strut loving the attention whereas Sonny
definitely doesn’t As they enter the building a bell RINGS

INT CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME

One glance at the tables tells everything about the school’s
social pecking order The Gods sit at the center tables and
the farther away you are from them the less cool you are

Bell walks past the Gods’ table and gives Keri a look that
could kill Keri responds by sticking her tongue out at Bell
Bell then mimes cutting her throat

CHEERLEADER 1
I cant believe you’re not scared of
her I mean she’s so evil like

KERI
Evil doesn’t scare me Ugly does

The Gods all LAUGH
ANGLE ON SONNY

Sonny sits all alone and reads “Slaughterhouse Five” ata
table on the farthest outskirts of the cafeteria

Flee sits at a loser table near Sonny’s After a beat he
grabs his tray and walks over to Sonny

FLEE
Mind if I eat here

Sonny answers without looking up from his book

SONNY
It’s a free country

Flee sits down

FLEE
You know if you eat all by yourself
people will talk

SONNY
That would only matter if I cared what
other people thought But I don’t

FLEE
Me neither I’m dank like that

Sonny doesn’t respond and after a beat Flee leans in and
studies the cover of the book

FLEE (contd)
Slaughterhouse Five You got
homework already

SONNY
Nope

Sonny

Sonny

Sonny

ANGLE

Sonny

FLEE
Then how come you’re reading it

SONNY
Because knowledge is power

FLEE
Is it about the meat business Like
Super Size Me was about McDonald’‘s I
haven’t eaten there since I saw it

finally lowers the book down

SONNY
Look kid sit there if you want but
me giving you a lift doesn’t make us
buddies and the truth of it is if you
really knew me you wouldn’t want to
know me Now if you don’t mind

raises the book back up
FLEE
Geez I just asked a question You
dont have to flip out
SLAMS the book down on the table

SONNY
Does no good deed go unpunished

ON THE GODS
SLAMMING his book down catches Bufton’s attention
BUFTON

Check it out Flee and his new
boyfriend are having a lovers spat

They all look over in Sonny and Flee’s direction

KERI
I highly doubt new guys gay

CHEERLEADER 1
Shouldve seen the way he checked Keri
out in English last week

All the cheerleaders GIGGLE Bufton gives Keri a hard stare

KERI
Not my job to stop guys staring at me

BUFTON
Come on Psycho time to give new guy a
heartfelt hello
Bufton and Psycho charge off toward the land of the losers and
Keri smiles a bitchy little smile

ANGLE ON SONNY AND FLEE

Flee senses something and looks over his shoulder

FLEE
Ah dookie

Sonny glances up at the approaching boys

SONNY

These the powers that be
FLEE

Yeah Our resident fascists
SONNY

Let me do the talking
Bufton and Psycho arrive at the table All eyes are on them

BUFTON
Welcome to Frost Grommet Insert all
the other bullshit that makes it sound
like I care Now see that chick
(points at Keri)
That‘s my property Look or ever think
about her again and Ill break you

PSYCHO
In Grommet terms Mess with the bull
and you get the horns bra

SONNY
Didnt know Stans Won’t happen
again

BUFTON

Glad were on the same page faggot

Bufton waits for a response but Sonny just smiles Bufton taps
Psycho’s shoulder and they start to head back to their table
Flee says the next line low but just loud enough to be heard

FLEE
Takes one to know one

Bufton slams to a halt and turns back Sonnys face grimaces

BUFTON
Douche-bag said what

Flee looks to Sonny for support but he just stares away
Psycho starts to step forward but Bufton stops him Bufton
then grabs Flee’s plate of food and dumps it over his head
BUFTON (contd)
Get up and dance like a monkey

PSYCHO
(screams )
Do it you little Scrode-chode

Flee’s lower lip trembles as he slowly stands up and starts
dancing like a monkey The cafeteria explodes into LAUGHTER

SONNY
Why you gotta be such a dick

BUFTON
Because I can

SONNY
Sounds like hubris to me

BUFTON
If that means you’ve got a problem
with the Bufton we can step outside
and take care of it right now

Psycho cracks his knuckles and Bufton puffs his chest out

SONNY
Not my battle bro

Bufton gives Sonny a hard stare then flips his tray of food
onto the floor The boys walk off and Flee with tears in his
eyes runs out of the cafeteria in humiliation

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Flee sits against a wall and wipes the food off himself Right
above his head is a plaque with ROBERT FROSTS “The Road Not
Taken” inscribed on it Sonny comes storming up to him

SONNY
Did I or did I not tell you to keep
your mouth shut

FLEE
Leave me alone

SONNY
Will do Permanently

Sonny starts to leave

FLEE
I just wanted you to think I was dank

Sonny stops in his tracks and turns back
SONNY
And you thought insinuating that the
school bully was a cock-gobbler was
the best way to go about it

FLEE
I’m sorry I mess everything up I’d
be better off dead

Flee starts to full on cry - it’s pathetic Sonny let’s out a
frustrated SIGH

SONNY
Christ kid don’t say stupid shit
like that Look we all We all make
mistakes alright So calm down

Flee nods his head and stops the waterworks

FLEE
Does that mean

SONNY
Stop Just Stop talking

Sonny shakes his head sits down next to Flee and lights a
cigarette Flee coughs They sit in SILENCE until

FLEE
You know those things are bad for you

SONNY
You know you can be really annoying

FLEE
Yeah thats why they call me Flee

EXT HIGH SCHOOL — LATER

A bell RINGS and students pour out of the school Sonny and
Flee walk across the parking lot to the GTO Sonny gets to the
driver side door first opens it and jumps back a foot

SONNY
What the

Sonny kicks the door shut and starts pacing Flee peeks inside
and sitting on the driver seat is a huge human turd
FLEE
A Psycho Steamer I hate getting
those

Sonny looks over at Flee in amazement

r ) SONNY
The dude’s deuced on you
FLEE

times

Sonny bursts out LAUGHING and Flee looks pissed

FLEE (contd)
It’s not funny

Sonny forces himself to stop laughing and composes himself

SONNY
You’re right Apologies

FLEE
So what are you gonna do

Sonny stares intensely at Flee for a long beat and starts
nodding his head which clearly makes Flee uncomfortable

SONNY
What I shouldve done in the first
place
(beat)
If the Gods want a war we give them a
war
FLEE

A war I meant about getting the
dookie out of the car I don’t want a
war I’m a monkey-dancer not a
fighter And what’s with this we all
of a sudden Mister-I-wanna-fly-solo

Sonny lights a cigarette

SONNY

I know their type and these guys won’t
stop pushing on us unless we make
them so like it or not we’re in this
together

(beat)
For he today that sheds his blood with
me shall be my brother

(takes a drag)
Now take care of the turd-bomb

FLEE
Me

Sonny gives him a hard look and Flee quickly caves in

FLEE (contd)
Fine

Mumbling to himself Flee grabs his notebook and starts
ripping out sheets of paper to use to clean up the shit

INT SONNY’S CAR - LATER

The boys drive home in SILENCE

SONNY
Cheer up little man your lifes
about to take a turn for the better

FLEE
Kinda hard to be cheery when youve
just cleaned human poop out of a car

Sonny glances over at Flee and smiles a wicked little smile

SONNY
If you could have any wish what would
it be

FLEE
I don’t know To see Keri Kent’s
twinkle

SONNY

No idea of what a twinkle is and not
sure I wanna find out Try again

Flee shrugs his shoulders

FLEE
To be homecoming king then

Sonny thinks about it for a second

SONNY
Yeah that’1l work Consider it done

Flee doesn’t say anything just stares forward

SONNY (contd)
You don’t seem excited

FLEE
Like thats really gonna happen I
mean do you honestly think Bufton
will just up and give me the crown

SONNY
Of course not We’re gonna have to
steal it from him

Flee looks at Sonny like he’s crazy

FLEE
Has the fact that you’re completely
nuts managed to escape your attention
(shakes his head)
On second thought my wish is to not
get pummeled in the face by Psycho

SONNY
That’s bueno thinking he’1ll
definitely have to be neutralized

FLEE
Neutralized Hes a two hundred pound
hitting machine who runs the forty in
four point four seconds flat The Gods
can’t be beaten They’re too strong

Sonny takes out a cigarette and lights it Flee coughs

SONNY
Those skilled in war subdue the
enemys army without conflict Battles
aren’t won by strength they’re a
product of a superior warrior’s
creative imagination Thus the
primary target is not the body of the
enemy but the mind

Flee stares at Sonny in utter confusion

FLEE
I have absolutely no idea of what
you’re talking about

SONNY
Before it’s all over You will

FLEE
Ah dookie I’m gonna die without ever
getting to see a girl’s twinkle

Sonny slaps the back of Flee’s head

FLEE (contd)
Ooowww

SONNY
Stop saying that word It’s creepy

FLEE
Which one Dookie or twinkle

SONNY
Both

INT FLEE’S BASEMENT — LATER

The basement’s unfinished and pretty typical boxes an old
sofa a poker table junk and a ping pong table in the middle

The boys stand at opposite ends of the table Flee serves a
very weak and high arcing serve Sonny slams the ball and it
whips past Flee He scurries off to find it

SONNY
Five weeks until homecoming Not a lot
of time to depose an incumbent ruling
house but definitely doable Probably
best to use a three stage approach

Flee returns to the table and serves the ball Sonny slams it
and again it whips past Flee who runs off to get it

SONNY (contd)
Phase one fortify our defenses
eliminate their heavy weaponry and
forge a coalition
(beat)
Who’s the most formidable non-God

FLEE
Rainey

SONNY
Which clan

FLEE

He’s the head of the Gears

SONNY
Perfect Now how to get rid of Psycho

Flee gets back to the table and serves Sonny is lost in
thought and just taps the ball back Flee returns it and the
boys rally while Sonny thinks

SONNY (contd)
Wait I got it We’ll need a camera
a slut and a friendly gay bar

Flee completely whiffs the shot he’s about to hit and looks up
at Sonny like he’s crazy

SONNY (contd)
Don’t worry I got a camera You just
have to take care of the rest

Flees jaw drops and the room goes SILENT - except for the
ping pong ball bouncing

SONNY (contd)
Only joking little man Point me in
the direction of a slutty girl and
Ill handle everything

Flee breaths a SIGH of relief

FLEE

Bell dark mistress of the Goths
SONNY

See like her that was easy

(beat)
Unfortunately this next bit wont be

Sonny takes a cig out and lights it Flee coughs as usual

SONNY (contd)
You gotta be less of an idiot because
your mouth is a flat out liability A
skilled warrior moves as intangibly as
a ghost in the starlight he is
obscure inaudible Airight

FLEE
Fine Ill try But you have to stop
smoking It makes me nauseous

SONNY
Did you just give me an ultimatum

FLEE
No Maybe Yeah

SONNY
Thats the fighting spirit
(thinks for a beat)
Fair is fair you got yourself a deal

Sonny drops the cigarette on the floor and puts it out with
his foot

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
A bell RINGS as the boys walk toward the school

FLEE

Hey Ive been thinking and I might
have a plan for getting rid of Psycho
that’s less weird sounding than yours
We steal something priceless from a
museum plant it in his locker and
turn him in He’d get sent to jail for
like forever Saw it in a movie once

Sonny smacks the back of Flee’s head hard
FLEE (contd)
Ooowww why’d you do that

SONNY
I quit smoking and you stop saying
stupid things that’s the agreement
(beat)
Christ if that idea was any dumber
you’d have to wear a helmet

INT HALLWAY - LATER

Bell takes books out of her locker She shuts the door and
standing there are Sonny and Flee

SONNY
So Flee tells me youre a slut

Flee’s eyebrows shoot up

FLEE
No I He I You

BELL
Thats the rumor Turd-boys
(off Sonnys expression)
Heard about Psycho’s little present

SONNY
Well then now that the niceties are
out of the way we wanted to see if
youd be interested in helping us

BELL
Take the Gods down Count me in

SONNY
Don‘t you wanna

BELL
Couldnt care less In fact I highly
doubt youll succeed but if youre
giving it a shot I’m your girl

SONNY
Not a fan of theirs I take it

BELL
Wouldnt want to kill any just hit
them all in the head with a
sledgehammer a couple hundred times

Bell slams her locker shut and heads off to class - leaving
the boys standing there alone

FLEE
She kinda scares me

SONNY
Feisty I‘ll give her that
(beat)
One down and one to

INT AUTO SHOP - LATER

Rainey wearing coveralls lies on a dolly on the ground next
to a car he’s working on Sonny and Flee stand over him

RAINEY
No The Gears got no quarrel with the
Gods but if you do then enjoy whats
left of your short lives
(beat)
And that ain’t a crack at your height
Flee I got a cousin who’s a midget

FLEE
Thanks I Think

Rainey slides under the car

SONNY
You know what the golden rule is

FLEE
Those with the gold rule
Sonny looks at Flee in surprise

SONNY
Very good grasshopper

FLEE
If I had money to throw around Id
already be a God

SONNY
That’s not the kind of gold Im
thinking about
(he squats down)
Well give you a case of beer a week

Rainey rolls out from under the car

RAINEY
Payment up-front

Rainey slides back under the car Sonny and Flee start to make
their way out of the shop

SONNY
That went as well as could be
expected

FLEE
Uh minus the fact that getting beer
is impossible

SONNY
Nah it’s easy All you need is Super
Glue three guys and a box of condoms

FLEE
Now you’re scaring me

SONNY
If a general is not courageous he will
be unable to conquer doubts or create
great plans

INT BATHROOM - LATER

Overhead shot of Sonny and Flee sitting in separate stalls
Sonny eats a bag lunch

FLEE
Are we gonna have to spend every lunch
in here

SONNY
Only until Rainey comes on board

FLEE
This sucks

SONNY
War is hell

FLEE
I’m hungry

SONNY
Shouldve brought a bag lunch

FLEE
You didn’t tell me to

SONNY
I don’t tell you to breathe and yet
you do Take it as a lesson One must
always be thinking two steps ahead

Like a little kid Flee mouths the last line

FLEE
Hope you’re enjoying your meal

SONNY
The flavors are only five in number
but their blends are so various that
one cannot taste them all
Sonny smiles and Flee pulls his hair in frustration

FLEE
Stop talking like a fortune cookie

INT FLEE’S BASEMENT - LATER

Sonny Bell and Flee sit at the poker table Flee is
shamelessly staring at Bell’s breasts - like he’s mesmerized

SONNY
What do jocks fear most

FLEE
Being kidnapped by an evil clown

Sonny looks over at Flee

SONNY
Is that your greatest fear

FLEE
(sheepishly)
No

Sonny shakes his head

SONNY
Anyway its homosexuality

BELL
Why is that exactly

SONNY
Why is what

BELL
Why are high school guys so terrified
of homosexuals

SONNY
It supposedly has to do with the fact
that most teenagers have some level of
sexual ambiguity and until theyre
fully confident of their identity they
feel compelled to prove societal
normality

BELL
So they pick on gays to what Make
themselves feel straighter

SONNY
Pretty much

FLEE
(loudly)
I’m not
SONNY

Youre not what

FLEE
Sexually ambiguous I like girls

BELL
As evidenced by the fact you’ve been
staring at my breasts non-stop

Flee instantly looks away from Bells breasts

FLEE
No I wasn’t

BELL
It’s understandable I’m probably the
first girl who’s ever been in your
basement Big moment for you so
consider this time a freebie Next
time I‘1l knock your lights out

FLEE
I’ve had girls down here before

BELL
Like who

Flee thinks about it for a beat

FLEE
A cousin once

BELL
Oh that’s disgusting

SONNY
For Christ’s sake Weve got more
important things to discuss

BELL
Like your brilliant plan to turn
Psycho queer

Sonny takes a Zippo lighter out and subconsciously starts
opening and closing it over and over - very annoying

SONNY
Were not gonna make him gay
Just Create the illusion he is
(beat)
All warfare is based on deception

BELL
And how exactly do I fit into this

SONNY
offer the enemy a bait to lure him in
create disorder then strike Plus I
was hoping you could find us a gay bar
to use for the sting Not exactly my
strong suit

FLEE
(pipes in)
Mine either

BELL
Ill talk

Sonny continues to flick the Zippo open and shut Bell
snatches it from his hand

BELL (contd)
To the Queens

Bell puts the Zippo in her bag takes out a pack of gum and
tosses it to Sonny He gives her a hard stare but she doesn’t
even blink After a beat he takes a stick of gum out and
starts chewing it

SONNY
Moving on then Beer

EXT DRUGSTORE - LATER

The three of them stand in front of the store

FLEE
No way

SONNY
All you have to do is keep the cashier
distracted until we get up to the
register

FLEE
Why can’t Bell do it

SONNY
She’d be more conspicuous

Sonny takes some gum out and starts chewing it Bell smiles

FLEE
No one’s more conspicuous than me

BELL
Damn straight tit-starer

FLEE
See

SONNY
Tough You’re doing it and that’s
that We got glue
Bell holds up a tube of Super Glue

SONNY (contd)
It’s plunder time

Sonny and Bell walk in Flee SIGHS and follows

INT DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

Sonny and Bell head for the back of the store and Flee walks
up to the pretty but bored looking CASHIER

She’s chewing gum and blows a bubble Flee stands there
looking nervous After a beat she pops the bubble

CASHIER
Can I help you

FLEE
Need Condoms I

The Cashier takes a step toward the huge condom display on the
wall behind her We notice that Flee’s starting to sweat

CASHIER
Which brand Yoda

Flee hand shaking randomly points at an area The Cashier
grabs a box of condoms and tosses it on the counter Flee
frantically looks around for Sonny

ANGLE ON SONNY AND BELL

They‘re in the back of the store at the refrigerators Sonny
is taking out a case of beer and Bell grabs a case of Coke

ANGLE ON FLEE

Flee pretends to read the box for a beat looks for Sonny
again and scrunches his face when he doesnt see him

FLEE
Bigger Need bigger

The Cashier’s eyebrows shoot up

ANGLE ON SONNY AND BELL

Bell opens the case of Coke and dumps all the cans out onto a
shelf Sonny then opens the case of beer

They bring the open ends of each box together and Sonny tips
the beers up The beers all slide perfectly into the Coke box

Sonny dumps the beer box onto the shelf and takes out the
Super Glue He puts dabs of the glue on the open flaps of the
Coke box and shuts them

He holds them shut for a beat so the glue can set then takes
the case from Bell If you didn’t know youd have no idea he
wasn’t holding a regular case of Coke

ANGLE ON FLEE

The Cashier puts a box of Trojan Magnums on the counter and
Flee wipes the sweat off his forehead

CASHIER
I dated a guy who was that big Talk
about hurts so good

The Cashier sexually twirls her gum on her finger

FLEE

That That’s A nice story

(struggles)
My girlfriend’s at college But
she’s coming home this weekend For
a sex visit Lots of sex Maybe
you knew her Amanda Beckett Went
to Ridgemont High Boy do we have
fast times together Yeah

Sonny and Bell come strolling up Sonny puts the case of Coke
on the counter and Flee let’s out a huge SIGH of relief

BELL

Magnums You go sexual vanilla
FLEE

Can Can we please just pay I’m

feeling kinda hot here
EXT DRUGSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

Sonny and Bell triumphantly walk out of the store Flee
sullenly trails behind them carrying the Coke and a bag

BELL
Way wicked

SONNY
And the best part other than the fact
they dont card you is that a case of
Coke is cheaper than a case of beer

FLEE
Except we also had to pay for the
super big condoms

SONNY
No worries little buddy I’11 put
them to good use

Sonny grabs the bag from Flee as they all arrive at the car

BELL
Don’t even try to pretend youre hung
like that

Sonny innocently shrugs his shoulders

SONNY
Those skilled in the use of their
extraordinary forces are as infinite
as the heavens and earth as
inexhaustible as the flow of a river

BELL
What

Sonny smiles gives her a wink and gets into the car Bell
turns to Flee with an irritated look on her face

FLEE
Yeah pretty annoying when he does
that

INT SONNY’S CAR - LATER

The car pulls into Bell’s driveway and comes to a stop Bell
opens the door and gets out

BELL
It was real and it was fun But it
wasn’t real fun

SONNY
Nice hanging with you too slut-shine

Bell makes a face at Sonny and slams the door shut Sonny
waits until she’s safely inside her house

SONNY (contd)
I’m not a chauffeur Pinche

Flee looks confused until it dawns upon him

FLEE
Oh

Flee moves from the back seat to the passenger seat Sonny
backs out of the driveway and heads down the street After
passing a few houses he stops besides a garbage can

SONNY
You can pitch the condoms now

FLEE
But you said

SONNY
of course there was a girl with us
Always keep the ladies thinking

FLEE
So you’re not

SONNY
Dude Asking a guy about the size of
his sword is bad Dong Shui

INT AUTO SHOP - MORNING

As is their norm the Gears tinker with a car before school
has started Sonny and Flee carrying the Coke case come
walking in Flee holds the case up to Rainey

SONNY
As promised

Rainey taps the side of his head with his fist

RAINEY
I may not pack that much horsepower
under the hood but I know the
difference between suds and soda

The Gears LAUGH

SONNY
You can’t tell how fast a car is by
its paint job
Rainey takes the Coke case opens it and smiles
RAINEY
Consider yourself covered for this
week but shove come to punch I ain‘t
fighting Psycho

SONNY
He won’t be an issue much longer

Rainey stares at Sonny for a beat

RAINEY
I got no love for Bufton and he ain’t
no God but the real ones sure do seem
to smile upon him and his kind You
get what Im saying

Sonny smiles his wicked little smile
SONNY
Those whom the Gods would destroy they
first make all powerful
With that Sonny turns and walks off Flee follows

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Bufton Keri Cheerleader 1 and Psycho stare at Bufton’s
locker Written on it in marker is “Alea iacta est”

BUFTON
The hell

PSYCHO

It means the die is cast or in
football terms it’s on Caesar said
it when he crossed the Rubicon with
his legion which in effect meant he
was declaring civil war

(off Bufton’s expression)
What I take Latin But it’s not
like I’m in Latin Club or anything

KERI
Wonder which jank lil’ Grommet did it

Bufton shakes his head
BUFTON
Gotta be new guy or as I now like to
call him dead-meat

Psycho cracks his knuckles

PSYCHO
Shock and awe baby

INT CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME

Sonny and Flee sit at their table eating Something catches
Flee’s attention and he looks up

FLEE
You sure that graffiti-bomb was a
smart move

SONNY
Agitate your enemy to ascertain the
pattern of their movement

FLEE
Oh theyre agitated that’s for sure

SONNY
Good If a generals quick tempered
you can make a fool of him

FLEE
Good Not good they look royally
pissed

Bufton Psycho and a couple other Gods walk up to table and
they do in fact look royally pissed

BUFTON
Lets go

SONNY
Go Go where I didn’t even know we
had a date

BUFTON
Don’t play dumb shit-head I know you
wrote that crap on my locker

SONNY
No idea of what you’re talking about
Poindexter so make like a hockey
stick and puck off

Psycho grabs the front of Sonnys shirt and pulls him up out
of his chair The second he touches him we hear a commotion -
the Gears all stand up and make their way over to the table

BUFTON

This doesn’t concern you Rainey
RAINEY

Now it does
SONNY

(a la Tony Montana)
Say hello to my lil’ bodyguard

PSYCHO
Screw it we can take them all

SONNY
Maybe But not without a few of you
finding your football season cut
short Which begs the question are
you feeling lucky punks

Bufton looks like he’s about to explode but Sonny’s right and
there’s nothing he can do about it at the moment Bufton taps
Psycho and he unhappily releases Sonny’s shirt

BUFTON
Catch you later Grommet and I mean
that laterally

SONNY
Actually you mean literally but
thanks for sharing low-fi

Both the Gods and the Gears tense up Bufton looks like he
wants to kill Sonny but gives his boys the retreat signal
instead and the Gods head back to their table

FLEE
That was awesome

SONNY
That was only the beginning

INT SONNYS CAR — LATER

Wide-eyed and terrified Flee sits in the back scrunched
between the Queens two extremely GAY GOTH GUYS Sonny drives
and Bell sits shotgun

FLEE

FLEE

Flee wipes the sweat off his forehead

GAY GOTH GUY 2
Do you know why most guys become gay

Flee nervously shakes his head no

GAY GOTH GUY 2 (contd)
They get sucked into it

Gay Goth Guy 2 licks his lips seductively

BELL

GAY GOTH GUY 2
Sorry he’s just so petite-n-sweet
INT GAY BAR — LATER
The Gang stands in front of the flamboyantly GAY BAR OWNER

GAY BAR OWNER
I would love to help boys but as
youre underage unless you rent the
bar out for the night my hands are
tied and not in a good way

GAY GOTH GUY 1
How much

GAY BAR OWNER
A thousand is as low as I could go and
that would barely cover costs

Sonny nudges Flee in the back

SONNY
(under his breath)
Go convince him

FLEE
(under his breath)
I cant

SONNY
(under his breath)
You didn’t think you could buy those
condoms either

Flee starts to retort but Sonny pushes him to the front of the
group He now stands face to face with the Gay Bar Owner

GAY BAR OWNER
Cute but you can’t bribe me into it

Flee looks like a deer caught in the headlights There’s a
very long SILENT beat and then

FLEE
Re Remember those guys at your high
school who made every single day of
your life a living hell

GAY BAR OWNER
Vividly You think it’s tough being
gay now

FLEE
I‘m not Just because a persons
different doesn’t give them the right
to shit on us but no one ever stands
up to those jerks and someone should

Gay Bar Owner suddenly becomes serious and less flamboyant

GAY BAR OWNER
Tomorrows biker night that’s your
best bet I’11 arrange everything

EXT GAY BAR - MOMENTS LATER

The Gang walks out of the bar triumphantly

GAY GOTH GUY 1
You were fantabulous

FLEE
No I was just Yeah

The entire group congratulates Flee who smiles and blushes

EXT SONNY’S HOUSE - LATER

The GTO pulls into the driveway and stops Both boys get out
of the car and Flee happily starts walking home

FLEE
See ya tomorrow

SONNY
Hold up

Flee stops and turns back

SONNY (contd)
Bueno work back there

FLEE
I just got lucky

Sonny smiles and starts chewing a stick of gum

SONNY
No such thing as luck You assessed
the situation chose a course of
action and made that guy change his
mind You shaped your own destiny
today and now that you know you can
its time to step it up a notch

Sonny opens his truck searches through the clutter and takes
out a dog-eared and worn looking book He then tosses it
perfectly to Flee Flee tries to catch it but drops it He
quickly leans down and picks it up

FLEE
(reads the cover)
The Art of War

SONNY
Think of it as the dummies guide to
being cool

FLEE
So if I read this Ill be dank

Sonny CHUCKLES

SONNY
You can’t just read it you have to
live it

With that Sonny slams the trunk shut and disappears into his
grandparent’s garage

INT FLEE’S ROOM LATER

His room is pretty much what you’d expect Lord of the Rings’
posters action figures Spiderman bedsheets etc He sits at
a small desk and opens the “The Art of War”

FLEE
Chapter one Estimates War is a
matter of vital importance the
province of life or death the road to
survival or ruin It is mandatory that
it be thoroughly studied

Flee looks up with an extremely confused look on his face
INT HALLWAY - DAY

Psycho gets books out of his locker Bell and Hot Goth Girl
walk up to him

PSYCHO
What do you weirdos want

Bell puts her arm around Hot Goth Girls waist

BELL
You Psycho That is If you’re man
enough for the both of us

Bell holds a single finger out and Hot Goth Girl sucks on it
for a beat Psycho smiles crazily at the girls

PSYCHO
Ive dreamt about this moment for a
long time The things I could do to
you two with a bag of marshmallows and
a can of Cheez Whiz
(beat)
Say where and I‘1ll be there

Hot Goth Girl looks a little freaked out but Bell is ice
BELL
Why don‘t we start off with some
cock Tails To loosen up the ‘ole
inhibitions

Bell takes a piece of paper from her bra and hands it to him

BELL (contd)
Just tell the bouncer you know me

Bell winks then plants a deep kiss on Hot Goth Girl

BELL (contd)
(sexy to Psycho)
Looking forward to our little outing

Bell and Hot Goth Girl walk off hand-in-hand Psycho punches
the air in excitement

INT CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME
Sonny and Flee sit alone at their usual table

SONNY
Tonight is gonna be fun

Flee nods his head and then

FLEE
I don’t get it

SONNY
What’s not to get Psycho shows up at
the gay bar and we

FLEE
Not that the book I mean how can
knowing ancient Chinese military
strategies make you dank

SONNY
Combat and being popular in high
school are not all that different
Traditionally the strongest person
wins but if one masters the indirect
approach which is what the Art of War
teaches then the use of subtlety
surprise and manoeuvre becomes ten
times more powerful than brute force

FLEE
Uh yeah that doesn’t really help me

SONNY
Direct approach war punch Psycho in
the face and hell kill you

(MORE )
SONNY (contd)
Socially tell people you have a
college girlfriend that no one’s ever
seen and theyll hate you Indirect
approach war lure the guy to a gay
bar and you can devastate him without
a single blow Socially show up at an
event with a hot looking hooker and
never ever say a word about who she
is and people will worship you

Flee‘s jaw drops

FLEE
Were We’re gonna Hire
Prostitutes

SONNY
Only using it as an example Unless
of course you want to

FLEE
No no Hooker free’s good with me
(beat)
But I still don’t get it

Sonny smiles

SONNY
Just keep on watching and learning
grasshopper

FLEE
Why do I gotta learn it You already
know it all

SONNY
Give a man a fish and he eats for a
day Teach him to fish and he eats for
a lifetime

EXT GAY BAR -— CONTINUOUS

Psycho walks up to the BOUNCER at the door

PSYCHO

BOUNCER

Psycho struts into the bar
INT GAY BAR - CONTINUOUS
Psycho enters and freezes in his tracks The place is packed -

think the Hells Angels but really really gay The music
suddenly stops and all eyes turn to him
PSYCHO
Jesus what are you all faggots

GAY BIKER
You nailed us Now it’s our turn

Several bikers step forward and as big as Psycho is they’re
twice his size and way more built

pun intended of harassment don’t it

PSYCHO
I I I feel Vi Violated

SONNY
Good and on that note unless you want
these lovely action shots getting
around school I highly suggest you
transfer to St Mary’s pronto

Sonny drops prints of all the shots he took at the gay bar
onto the table Psycho stares at them in utter dismay

SONNY (contd)
I know you couldn’t look gayer if you
had a cock in your mouth

Psycho suddenly gets a crazed look in his eyes He lunges
across the table and grabs Sonny by the neck

SONNY (contd)
(choking)
Hurt me and Flee will post the photos
on every gay website on the internet

Psycho’s rage instantly deflates He releases Sonny and slides
back down into his seat

PSYCHO
(frustrated)
But I’m not gay

SONNY
Aint that the bitch of it
(chuckles)
Christ I wish I had a cig to enjoy
this with

Sonny starts chewing a stick of gum ferociously

PSYCHO
Even if I wanted to go to Catholic
school my dad will never go for it

SONNY
He’ll have to if you get expelled

PSYCHO
Principal Lesman won’t expel me Im
the best player the team’s ever had

A smile spreads across Sonny’s face as “Funeral Music For
Queen Mary (March)” from A Clockwork Orange begins to play

SONNY
Where there’s a will there’s a way
Little brother

INT HALLWAY — MORNING

There are no sounds other than the song Psycho walks down the
hallway with a determined look on his face He carries a large
duffle bag in one hand

He walks past Bufton who says something but we can’t hear what

keeps walking

INT PRICIPAL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

(crazed)
Weve awoken a sleeping giant and
filled it with a terrible resolve

BUFTON
I dont
(yells)
Psycho
But it’s too late the cops have dragged Psycho out of range

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Sonny Flee and Bell watch the cops drag Psycho to their car
and stuff him in the back Cheerleader 1 comes running out
She screams Psycho’s name and pounds on the backseat window as
the car pulls away

SONNY
Christ I love to crush my enemies To
see them driven before me and to hear
the lamentations of their woman

BELL
Youre one sick and twisted individual
and I mean that as a compliment

SONNY
Why thank you Bell
(beat)
Now to put the last piece of the
puzzle into place

INT HALLWAY - END OF DAY

The final bell RINGS and students race out of their
© classrooms We see Sonny and Flee walking against the current

49

FLEE
Why do we need the Geeks

SONNY
He whose ranks are united in purpose
will be victorious

Flee starts to retort but Sonny heads into a classroom before
he can say anything

INT CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

“Latin Club” is written on the chalkboard Allison and the
Geeks mill about Sonny and Flee walk up to her

ALLISON
Salve which means hello Are you
gentlemen interested in joining Latin
Club

FLEE
Yeah right

Sonny slaps the back of Flee’s head
SONNY

Actually we were hoping youd join
our “club” as it were

ALLISON
And why would I consider doing such
SONNY
To have some fun for once in your
life
ALLISON

We have plenty of fun

Sonny looks around the classroom at all the Geeks Then takes
a stick of gum out and starts chewing it

SONNY SUBTITLE
Stercus tauri Bullshit

Allison smiles at Sonny’s use of Latin

ALLISON (contd)
I admire what you’re attempting to do
but statistically speaking it‘s an
impossible endeavour

SONNY
Impossible is a word found only in the
dictionary of fools
(beat)
Trust me I know what I’m doing

ALLISON SUBTITLE
Quidquid id est timeo Danaos Whatever it is I fear the
et dona ferentes Greeks even bearing gifts
SONNY SUBTITLE
Si vis pacem para bellum If you wish for peace prepare
for war
ALLISON

War is a grave matter one is
apprehensive lest men embark upon it
without due reflection
Sonny CHUCKLES and briefly bows his head in deference

SONNY
Touche Let’s go Flee

Sonny briskly walks out of the classroom

INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Sonny exits the room with Flee hot on his heels

FLEE
Stop

Sonny obliges and Flee holds his hands up as if to say “What
the fuck just happened”

SONNY
She’ll think about it but I wouldnt
hold my breath

FLEE
So we give up just like that

SONNY
I made a miscalculation I always
thought the worst part of being a Geek
or Loser was that you never got to
have any real fun but clearly

FLEE
That’s not even close to the worst
part and I know better than anyone

SONNY
Then why didn’t you say something

FLEE
You didn’t ask

SONNY
So what are you gonna do about it

FLEE
Me
The boys stare each other down until a smile slowly spreads
across Flees face

FLEE (contd)
Fine

Flee heads back into the classroom and Sonny smiles his wicked
little smile for a beat before following

INT CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

Flee with Sonny behind him stands just inside the doorway

FLEE
Join us and we guarantee that every
Geek who wants will have a date to
homecoming Carpe diem

The Geeks collectively catch their breath and turn to stare
expectantly at Allison - we can feel the pressure on her

FLEE (contd)
(under his breath)
Carpe diem means let’s party right

SONNY
(under his breath)
Close enough
We see Allison slowly cave in against her better judgement
ALLISON
Under those terms we accept The
Geeks are yours to command

The Geeks all CHEER and Sonny high-fives Flee - though it’s
totally awkward as Flee’s clearly not used to high-fiving

SONNY
Phase one is now complete

INT SONNY‘S CAR — LATER

The boys drive home and Flee looks pretty happy with himself

FLEE
I did good today huh

SONNY
Definitely an excellent use of the
indirect approach On your part

Flee thinks about Sonny’s last sentence for a second

FLEE
Ah doo Crap You wanted her to say
no to you to see what I’d do

Sonny starts chewing a stick of gum

SONNY
Maybe Maybe not but either way I
was impressed with the fact you threw
down a layered ploy Youre finally
starting to think two steps ahead

FLEE
I am I mean Yeah I am
(beat)
How exactly was it layered

SONNY
Itll come to you

INT FLEE’S BASEMENT - LATER

Flee and Rainey play ping pong - Flee holds his own Bell sits
on the sofa and Allison is seated at the poker table

SONNY
The supreme importance in war is to
attack the enemys strategy In simple

terms What makes the Gods cool
ALLISON
Theyre the beautiful people
SONNY

Granted beauty’s an advantage but
anyone can be pretty if they’re
popular enough Take Mick Jagger for
example uglier than sin and yet a
sexual icon

RAINEY
Don’t bag on the Stones man

SONNY
Only saying how it is Chico My point
being popularity’s an illusion Flee
what do you most envy about them

Flee thinks about it for a beat

FLEE
I guess that they eat at the cool
table make up the cool words and wear
the cool clothes

SONNY
Exactly Take those away from them and
the empire will come tumbling down

BELL
And you’ve got some nifty plan to
steal their mojo no doubt

SONNY
Target George and the great outdoors

The Gang stares at Sonny blankly and he smiles

SONNY (contd)
The Gods don’t dress better than you
they just wear stuff that most people
cant afford To counter it we have
to create a style that’s simple and
inexpensive Something everyone can
buy Cheap as chic

A cell phone RINGS - it plays GLORIA GAYNOR’S “TI Will
Survive” All eyes turn to Allison but she shakes her head
Everyone then looks at Flee and he reluctantly answers it

FLEE

Hello I can’t I’m busy Fine
(hangs up)

I gotta jet but you guys can stay

SONNY
Where could you possibly have to go

FLEE
(embarrassed)
A tea party
(off Sonny’s expression)
You know The whole bike thing

SONNY
She’s a child Tell her no

FLEE
Shes pretty tough

EXT STEPHANIES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Stephanie stands in her doorway and Sonny stares her down

SONNY
Deal’s off kid

STEPHANIE
Not-uh

SONNY

Ya-huh and that’s how it is Welcome
to the real world

STEPHANIE
(yells)
Mommy a strange boy just tried to
touch my pee-pee

Off Sonnys shocked face
INT STEPHANIES ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

The entire Gang is now seated around Stephanie’s little table

STEPHANIE
Tea

SONNY
Whatever

Stephanie pours an imaginary cup of tea for everyone

STEPHANIE
(to Allison)
Those glasses don’t fit your face
(to Flee)
Fart-sniffer
(to Bell)
Make-up’s a bit much You need help
(to Rainey)
One word grease-monkey shower

RAINEY
Who is this little monster

FLEE
Everyone meet Stephanie Smith future
head cheerleader

STEPHANIE
I can’t wait

INT TARGET - LATER

The Gang simultaneously walks out of several changing rooms
All of them wear the “new uniform” ie nearly identical
outfits - same style shoes same brand of pants or skirt anda
short sleeve t-shirt over a long sleeve t-shirt The colors of
the outfits vary per person though

RAINEY
I feel like a Grommet

SONNY
You mean like a George Grommets
their word and we no longer use those
because that empowers them

FLEE
We can’t just make up new dank words

The boys

SONNY
Why not A cool word is nothing but
gibberish and anyone can make that up
Only reason most people don’t is
because they’re afraid they’ll get
laughed at but the age of fear is
over From now on anyone who wants can
make up a cool word

BELL
And George is the best you could come
up with for loser

SONNY

It’s Bufton’s first name
BELL

Love it
RAINEY

I don’t and I can’t tell my crew to
dress exactly like everyone else What
we wear is how we show who we are

SONNY
No Rainey How you act is how you
show who you are

stare each other down until Allison raises her hand

SONNY (contd)
Yes Allison

ALLISON
One time at math camp

FLEE
Does this end with you putting a
calculator somewhere you shouldnt

Sonny smacks the back of Flee’s head

sonny winks at Allison and she smiles

ALLISON
As I was saying we were divided into
teams for the calculus decathlon but
to our dismay provided with no means
by which to differentiate So we
customized the camp t-shirts ourselves
with patches buttons and iron-ons

SONNY
That’s bueno thinking Williams
(beat)
You heard the lady If you wanna show
personality add some flair Alright

EXT HIGH SCHOOL LUNCH TIME

The Gang sits outside all by themselves They all wear the new
uniform but each one has decorated theirs differently and we
can clearly see their personalities eg Rainey has safety
pinned a Metallica bandana to his shirt Bell has put studs on
her shirt and pants Allison has ironed on math formulas etc

BELL
Gee this is tons of fun

SONNY
Those skilled in war bring the enemy
to the field of battle and are not
brought there by him

BELL
I hate to state the obvious but we’re
the only people out here

SONNY
Which is why I assembled the leaders
of all the clans minus the Gods of
course Rally your troops and the rest
will fall into place

Allison raises her hand in the air

r SONNY (contd)
Yes Allison

ALLISON
Ive given it some thought and believe
I may have a word that encapsulates
the essence of dank Whiz-bang As in
making new friends is whiz-bang

SONNY
Actually maybe not everyone can
invent cool words Why dont we let
Bell take a crack at it instead

BELL
Crisp If Keri caught on fire and
burnt to a crisp that would be dank

SONNY
Giddy-up Crisp is the new cool
(gives Rainey a nod)
Why dont you finish things off and
give us a word for jank

RAINEY
I ain’t smart like that
SONNY
Sure you are First word that comes to
you Engine

RAINEY
Torque

SONNY
What‘s worse high or low

RAINEY
Depends but I‘1ll go with low

Sonny points at Flee

FLEE
Getting a swirly is low-torque

SONNY
Genius Congrats on inventing your
first saying Rainey
Rainey breaks into a smile first one weve seen on him

INT BATHROOM - DAY

The place is packed with Get-by Girls Allison and Hot Goth
Girl in the new uniform check themselves out in the mirrors
Keri is in a stall expertly purging her lunch into a toilet

ALLISON
Did you see the Flintstone outfit Keri
Kent is wearing

HOT GOTH GIRL
So Hasselhoff

ALLISON
For Swayze

All the girls in the bathroom LAUGH Allison and Hot Goth Girl
exit and a beat later Keri bursts out of one of the stalls

KERI
Who said that

This brings more LAUGHTER Keri turns to Get-by Girl 1

KERI (contd)
Wipe that face off your head bitch

Get-by Girl 1s face turns red and Keri storms out of the
bathroom Bell steps out of a stall wearing a huge smile

INT DRUGSTORE NIGHT

Flee blushes and stands in front of the same Cashier

FLEE
I‘ll take the Uh shared sensation

CASHIER
They only come in regular size

FLEE
Oh well they’re for a friend Hes
too shy to buy condoms Unlike me
you know because I have a huge
Thing I mean pencil penis Big
penis not shy that’s me Yeah

INT SONNYS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Sonny sits in the drivers seat Flee Allison and Bell get in
with two beer filled Coke cases

SONNY
Two cases

BELL
Girls just do it better

ALLISON
We were able to significantly increase
our time efficiency by practicing
trial runs in my parents garage

FLEE
You practiced stealing beer

ALLISON
One doesn’t become valedictorian by
chance alone And for the record I
find this morally reprehensible

SONNY
Fun though isn’t it

Allison breaks into a smile
ALLISON
Indeed Who knew committing a crime
would be so exhilarating It was
totally Whiz-bang
Sonny disapprovingly shakes his head

INT HALLWAY — DAY

Bufton struts to class down the student packed hall He passes
the Queens in the new uniform at their lockers

GAY GOTH GUY 1
Don’t be a George Clay A’s way gay

Bufton stops grabs Gay Goth Guy 1 by the shirt and slams him
against the lockers

BUFTON
The hell does that mean

GAY GOTH GUY 1
He’s straight if you say big guy

A group of Get-by Guys quickly forms to watch the action

BUFTON
Not that Scrode-chode why’d you call
dick-head number two a George

GAY GOTH GUY 1
You know don’t be a loser George is
so like the new Grommet

BUFTON
That’s my first name ass-wipe

GAY GOTH GUY 2
Did he just say he’s gonna wipe your
ass Tres kinky

The entire hallway bursts into LAUGHTER Bufton looks over at
Gay Goth Guy 2 with rage in his eyes cocks his arm and
unleashes a vicious blow but

A massive hand catches Bufton’s hand inches from Gay Goth Guy
2s face He turns to find Rainey standing there Rainey
shakes his head no Bufton looks apoplectic but theres
nothing he can do

BUFTON
Don’t ever say my first name again and
stop dressing like retards

With that he releases Gay Goth Guy 1 rips his hand out of
Rainey’s and storms off

GAY GOTH GUY 1
Rough me up anytime Buff-Buff

Which brings more LAUGHTER from the crowd A beat later a
very happy looking Flee steps out from a doorway and gives the
Queens and Rainey the thumbs up

INT CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME

Everyone eats as normal and each clan sits in the respective
area Sonny and Flee suddenly stand up A second later all
the Gears Goths Geeks and Losers also stand up - about half
of them wear the new uniform
Then all at once they walk out of the cafeteria Through the
windows we can see that they are all sitting down on the grass
right outside of the cafeteria

ANGLE ON THE GODS

The cafeteria has remained pretty full with all the Get-—bys
still there but the Gods look far from happy

KERI
This is supposed to be our year Ours

BUFTON
Keep your thong up your ass Those
Grommets aren’t the only ones who can
play games I didn’t make all-region
without knowing strategy and as Coach
likes to say the best defense is a
strong offense

JOCK 1
Except when we had Psycho on the team

BUFTON
I’m not talking football dick-nose

JOCK 1
My bad bra What’s the play call

BUFTON
I’m thinking

JOCK 1
Sucks that Sonny fag is too much of a
load-catcher to fight you man-to-man

Bufton suddenly starts to smile

BUFTON
God am I smart
(beat)
I want everyone to snag a little cash-
ola from the rents tonight It’s time
to show them how the big dogs roll

INT AUTO SHOP - DAY
Rainey works on a car during class Bufton strolls on in

RAINEY
You lost or something

BUFTON
Something

Bufton smiles and takes out a huge wad of cash rolled tight
with a rubber band
BUFTON (contd)
In the arena of about a grand

RAINEY
So

Bufton throws the money at Rainey and he catches it
BUFTON
So it could be yours and Im not
asking you to betray your new found
friends Just take the Gears out of
the mix Be like Switzerland
Rainey and Bufton stare at each other for a long beat

INT FLEE’S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

Bell and Flee play pong and Flee is winning Sonny and Allison
sit at the poker table Rainey walks to the bottom of the
stairs and drops a beer filled Coke case onto the ground

RAINEY
I don’t want your beer no more

Sonny absentmindedly puts a stick of gum in his mouth

SONNY
Pray tell

RAINEY
Bufton offered me a kings ransom to
switch sides

BELL
Traitor

RAINEY
Don’t go all Donnie Darko I told him
to lick undercarriage From now on Im
doing this for me and no other reason

SONNY
How does it feel

RAINEY
Pretty darn good And you shoulda
seen Bufton’s face Worth all the
money in the world

SONNY
I knew youd make the right choice and
I‘m proud of you Brian You’re no
longer Ronin a mercenary but Samurai
a knight
Something that Sonny said catches Flee’s attention and he
stares intensely at his friend for a beat

RAINEY
Thanks man

Rainey beams with pride
INT FLEE’S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark until we hear a CLICK and a lamp on a night
stand turns on Flee gets out of bed and goes over to his
desk He turns another light on and flips thru “The Art of
War” until he finds what he’s looking for

FLEE
The skilful commander takes up a
position in which he cannot be
defeated and misses no opportunity to
master his enemy

Flee thinks for a beat and begins to smile He then sits down
at the desk and really starts to read the book

INT SONNY’S CAR -— MORNING

Sonny pulls into Flees driveway and Flee gets in Sonny then
backs the car out and heads to school

FLEE
Got it

SONNY
Got what

FLEE
The Art of Cool

SONNY
Do you now Well then enlighten me
grasshopper

Flee takes a stick of gum from a pack on the dash

FLEE
You always have to make it appear like
youre trying to achieve something
away from the actual intention Like
when you called Rainey your bodyguard
in the cafeteria I thought it was a
mistake I mean even a moron like
Buff was eventually gonna figure out
his services were for hire Which is
exactly why you said it Because
then you knew where he would attack
first and to counter that you paid
with beer instead of money

(MORE)

FLEE (contd)

Bosses give you cash but friends give
you gifts and by treating Rainey like
an equal you felt confident he’d be
insulted when Bufton tried to buy his
loyalty So not only did it
permanently push Rainey into our
camp It made the Gods’ opening
assault utterly useless

(beat)
Risky but as water has no constant
form there are in war no constant
conditions

Sonny stares at Flee like a proud father

SONNY
Hot damn you got it

Flee blows a bubble with his gum and pops it

FLEE
Told you so

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCH TIME

About half of the Get-bys are now eating lunch outside and the
majority of them wear the new uniform All of the Gears
Goths Geeks and Losers sport the new uniform Though we do
notice that every clan is in their own individual area

BELL
It’s working Unbelievable

SONNY
Deep down all anyone wants is to be
treated as an equal Give them the
chance and they’1l take it That being
said we gotta do something to coax
the rest of the Get-bys out

RAINEY
Who cares about them

ALLISON
Agreed they’re all just a bunch of
followers

SONNY
Exactly They’re the middle class
Whoever they think is cool is cool
regardless if they are or not You
cant win without them

FLEE
So what do you have in mind

SONNY
We throw a kegger

FLEE
I like it
(thinks for a beat)
Wait Where

SONNY
Where else your house

INT FLEE’S BASEMENT - LATER

Sonny and Flee play pong - they’re evenly matched now Rainey
Bell Allison and Stephanie who is overseeing a transplanted
fake tea party sit at the poker table

FLEE
No way My mom will never go for it

SONNY
You’11l convince her

FLEE
Even if I did you know the Gods will
find out and call cops on us

SONNY
So Ill snag my grandparents’ RV and
shuttle everyone

Flee thinks for a beat
FLEE
When near make it appear youre far
away And no one will drive drunk
brilliant
Sonny nods his head
RAINEY
(to Allison)
You have any idea of what the hell
theyre talkin’ about

ALLISON
Yeah it’s pretty straight forward

Rainey shakes his head in confusion

FLEE
And getting kegs

SONNY
Not a problem

With all eyes on him Flee struggles with the decision

STEPHANIE
Don’t be a fucking wuss you booger-
eater

FLEE
(sighs)
Fine Let’s make it happen
Flee slams the ping pong ball past Sonny

INT FLEES HOUSE — NIGHT

Flee and his Mother sit at a table and eat dinner

FLEE

party Clearly there will be beer but
no liquor or drugs and I promise no
one will drive drunk We even hired a
bouncer well not exactly hired but

nothing gets out of control

Flee’s Mother is clearly a bit taken back

FLEES MOTHER
I don’t I don’t understand

FLEE
You know how I always pretend my life
is great and you pretend like I’m
telling the truth Well Im done
pretending and I’m sick of being a
loser

FLEES MOTHER
Youre not a loser

FLEE
Mom we went to a Star Trek convention
for my sixteenth birthday

FLEES MOTHER
I had a great time that weekend

FLEE
And I wouldn’t trade it for the world
but let’s face it Ever since dad
died Ive I’ve had some problems
dealing with life

Her lower lip begins to tremble a bit

FLEES MOTHER
Youre a kind sensitive inquisitive
beautiful boy and those are rare and
wonderful traits to have

FLEE
I hope so but in high school All
they do is get your head shoved ina
toilet every other week And this is
my chance to put an end to that not
only for myself but for everyone

Flee smiles lovingly at his mother

FLEE (contd)
I love you and know you love me and I
wouldn’t ask you to do something like
this if it wasn’t important

FLEES MOTHER
Honey I I wish I could say yes but
I can’t It wouldn’t be right

FLEE
Im asking you just this once Dont
do whats right Do whats right for
me

Flee’s Mother sits there in SILENCE for a beat

FLEE’S MOTHER
Guess I better whip up a cake

Flee gives his mother a confused look

FLEE’S MOTHER (contd)
You know how Aunt Mindy likes her
sweets

INT DISTRIBUTOR WAREHOUSE - AFTER SCHOOL

Sonny and Flee stand at a counter On the other side of it
stands the DISTRIBUTOR Flee looks extremely nervous

Sonny takes a drivers license out of his wallet and hands it
to the Distributor He reads it then gives it back to Sonny

DISTRIBUTOR (contd)
Thank you sir What can I do you

SONNY
A couple of your finest kegs

EXT DISTRIBUTOR WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Sonny and Flee walk back to the car Flee looks pissed
FLEE
You have a fake ID
SONNY
of course
FLEE

Then why the whole song and dance to
get the cases of beer

SONNY
Sometimes the journey is more
important than the destination

FLEE
Christ youre Machiavellian
SONNY
Thanks little buddy
FLEE
(screams )

It wasn’t a compliment

INT HIGH SCHOOL DAY

Fat Nat stands at her locker and eats a candy bar A group of
cheerleaders walks past and notices her snacking

CHEERLEADER 1

The cheerleaders LAUGH and Fat Nat tries to ignore it

FLEE (0S)
Leave her alone

The cheerleaders turn to find Flee standing there

CHEERLEADER 1

Flee walks over to Cheerleader 1 and whispers in her ear

FLEE
Call me a pest or make fun of her ever
again and I‘1l tell everyone youve
been giving two dollar hand jobs under
the bleachers and don’t think I can’t
make it stick you dumb anorexic bitch

Cheerleader 1 catches her breath in shock and then quickly
scurries away Flee also starts to leave but then stops

FLEE (contd)
Youre coming to my party right

FAT NAT

FLEE
Everyone is but you can consider this
an official invitation

FAT NAT

FLEE

FAT NAT
But it’s true

FLEE
Im not saying it’s not and even if it
werent hell I’ve been telling
people I have a girlfriend in college
since seventh grade and I’ve never
even been on a real date Thing is
the harder you try to make people like
you the more they won’t so just let
them get to know you before you throw
something like that down Alright

Fat Nat nods her head

FLEE (contd)
Crisp See you there then

Flee walks off and Fat Nat smiles big

INT FLEE‘S HOUSE — NIGHT

The party rages and its like no high school party you‘ve ever

seen - it’s not a drunk-fest kids are just talking and having
fun We also notice that they’re all wearing name tags

ANGLE ON THE KEGS

Standing behind a makeshift bar is Stephanie Rainey walks up

RAINEY
Beer me

STEPHANIE
Show your hand

RAINEY
Just give me a beer kid

STEPHANIE
It shows it’s hand or it gets none

He tries to stare her down but she’s ice He finally gives in
and puts his hand out Stephanie marks it with a permanent
marker then grabs a cup of beer and holds it up Rainey
reaches for it but she pulls it away from him

STEPHANIE (contd)
Two dollars

RAINEY
You’re popping my clutch

STEPHANIE
All proceeds go to Flee’s safe ride
homecoming bus rental fund

Rainey angrily takes two bucks out of his pocket and slams it
down on the table Stephanie hands him the beer

RAINEY
I don’t like you little girl

STEPHANIE
Double D-I-T-T-O ditto diaper-breath

ANGLE ON THE LIVINGROOM

Fat Nat stands in front of a set of shelves and studies

FAT NAT

FLEE

Flee starts to walk off when a thought comes to him

FLEE (contd)
Oh hey I went to your Killers’
fansite and it’s pretty sweet and I
don’t know if you heard but I agreed
to set all the Geeks up for “HC” Now
half the damn school wants dates and I
could really use some computer help

FAT NAT
Okay

ANGLE ON THE DINING-ROOM

Sonny Rainey Allison and a dozen other kids sit around the
dining-room table In the middle of it a bottle spins around

RAINEY
Aren’t we a little old for this

SONNY

How can you ever be too old for a game
that lets two people kiss with no
strings attached What I can’t figure
out is why anyone ever stops playing
spin the bottle

The bottle stops on Rainey With a GIGGLE Allison leans
across the table and plants one hell of a kiss on him

RAINEY
Good Uh Yeah Game

INT BUFTON’S SUV - SIMULTANEOUS

The car comes to a stop across the street from Flee’s house

BUFTON

kind is what makes us superior
Besides this fag bash is o-ver

Bufton starts the car and hits the gas As they pull away he
takes out his cell phone and dials a number

BUFTON (contd)
(in fake adult voice)
Hi I’d like to report some underage

color wheel and calls out

The Twister kids groan as they struggle to move to the green
circles Flee‘s cell phone rings - this time it plays GUNS N
ROSES’ “Welcome to the Jungle” He answers it

FLEE (contd)
Yo Got it and thanks Bell
Flee hangs the phone up

The Cops are bit taken aback but before they can say anything
Sonny appears behind her

SONNY
Sorry officers she’s a real kidder
How can I help you

COP 1
We had a report there was a party in
progress at this address

SONNY
I wish but it’s just me baby-sitting
my bratty little sister
Cop 1 leans forward and listens - complete SILENCE

COP 2
No cars on the street either

Cop 1 gives them both a hard stare but they look as innocent
as can be especially uncharacteristically Stephanie

CoP 1
Sorry to bother you Have a good
evening and stay out of trouble

Stephanie starts to retort but Sonny quickly covers her mouth
ANGLE ON THE LIVINGROOM

The entire party still stands frozen Stephanie walks in and
gives Flee a nod

FLEE
(yells)
Party on

The crowd goes WILD and the party restarts All the kids
playing Twister instantly collapse to the floor

EXT FLEES ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

Bell sits on the roof and watches the cop car disappear down
the street She has an Ipod in one hand and a cell phone in
the other Sonny crawls out a window and sits next to her

SONNY
Go enjoy the party I’11l take lookout

Sonny takes some gum out and starts chewing

BELL

Not really my thing

(beat)
Got royally wasted at my first party
ever Wanted to impress Bufton’s older
brother John A senior slash star
quarterback Go figure Anyway the
last thing I remember before passing
out is going into a room with John and
kissing him on a bed The next day I
woke up lying beside George and the
only thing I knew for sure was that I
was no longer a virgin And as an
added bonus Keri Kent made it her job
spreading the rumor I was a slut even
though I haven’t had sex with anyone
since Needless to say Ive kinda
lost my lust for alcohol and parties

SONNY
Is that why you hide behind all that
make-up and metal

BELL
Im not hid

They both stare out into the darkness for a long SILENT beat

BELL (contd)
You probably think I’m pretty gross I
know I do

SONNY
Actually I think you’re pretty
amazing and

Sonny smiles his wicked smile stands up and bows with a
flourish while trying to keep his balance on the slanted roof

SONNY (contd)
I would be honored if you agreed to
accompany me to the homecoming dance

We can tell Bell is blushing even though we can’t see it
through the white make-up covering her face

BELL
Dont ask me out of pity

SONNY

I only pity those who are afraid of
taking risks

(beat)
Some say the world will end in fire
some say in ice From what Ive tasted
of desire I hold with those who favor
fire

Bell lets out an uncharacteristically girlish GIGGLE

BELL
Wow was that cheesy

SONNY
Cheesy Waxing poetic is never

A shingle Sonny’s standing on gives out he falls onto his
back and slides off the roof We hear him land with a THUD and
GROAN Bell scrambles to the edge and looks down at him He
lies perfectly on his back A bit stunned but unharmed

BELL
Are you alright

SONNY
Only if you say yes

BELL
I wont get all dressed up like some
stupid stuck up Barbie bitch doll

SONNY
Wear whatever you feel like

BELL
Okay

SONNY
Just okay

BELL
Don‘t push it buddy I said Id go

ANGLE ON THE BASEMENT

A few Get-by Guys sit around the poker table drinking and
joking Flee sits down and the conversation comes to a stop

FLEE
So how yall doing

Complete SILENCE

FLEE (contd)
Alrighty then

Flee takes a sip of beer and then pours some onto his hand

GET-BY GUY 1
Dude why are you wasting the beer

FLEE
I’m not wasting it Just getting my
date drunk
Flee kisses his hand and the table bursts into LAUGHTER

GET-BY GUY 1
This guy’s totally crisp

ANGLE ON THE KITCHEN

Goth 1 holds his thumb to the end of a beer bong waiting for
the foam to rise Allison stares at it with great interest We
notice Einsteins face on the front of her new uniform shirt

ALLISON
If you were to attach a standard hose
value to the end of the tube it would
in essence self load itself

GOTH 1
Serious

ALLISON
I never joke about physics

GOTH 1
Thats a wicked idea Thanks

Goth 1 hands her the now ready beer bong

ALLISON
No I Oh what the heck

Allison takes it and tentatively puts her lips on the tube
SMASH CUT

ANGLE ON THE LIVINGROOM

Allison walks in holding the empty beer bong above her head

ALLISON
Einstein can suck my relativ-a-titty

The entire party CHEERS and she lets out a huge BURP

ANGLE ON FAT NAT

Fat Nat stands in a corner people watching Gay Goth Guy 1
and 2 walk up

GAY GOTH GUY 1

Id die if you said youd make me one

FAT NAT

A glint of acceptance starts to shine in Fat Nat’s eyes

ANGLE ON THE KEGS

Gear 1 walks up to the makeshift bar and he’s clearly a bit
buzzed He holds his hand out and on it we see five pen marks

STEPHANIE
Looks like someone’s had enough

GEAR 1
Come on don’t be a low-torque bitch

Stephanie smiles grabs a baton and nails Gear 1 in the
balls He instantly crumbles to the ground in pain

STEPHANIE
Did that hurt poop-head Because it
looked like it hurt

INT RV- LATER

Dozens of kids are crammed inside the rather large RV - still
having fun Sonny drives and Bell sits shotgun Sonny brings
the RV to a stop and Bell opens the door

SONNY
Mantua Next stop Fairfax Acres and
remember go straight to bed If you
try to talk to your parents they’1l
know you’ve been hitting the sauce

Several kids file off the RV Bell shuts the door and Sonny
puts the vehicle back into motion

Bell slowly and shyly lets her left hand drop over the seat
Sonny smiles and grabs it with his right hand

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCH TIME

All the Get-bys are now outside and the clans are all mixed
together
We notice that everyone wears the new outfit and theyre
decorated in an awesome and wide variety of ways A Get-by Guy
walks up to thank Flee

FLEE
Glad you made it Jeff

Next it’s a Get-by Girl’s turn

pretty pathetic looking

CHEERLEADER 1
This sucks

JOCK 1
Totally low-torque

KERI
Dont use their words

JOCK 1
I meant jank sorry

BUFTON
Would everyone stop looking so God-
damned pathetic We never show
weakness The only pain that matters
is the pain we inflict

KERI
The only thing that’s gonna be
inflicted is one of those peasants
onto the homecoming court
BUFTON
Shut your whining I’m the man with
the plan and once we’re crowned king
and queen Everything will go back
to how it should be

INT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

MS DANIELS a prudish looking teacher sits behind a table
set up in the lobby She checks names off a list as students
place their homecoming court votes into a box

Our Gang waits their turn in line to vote They all wear t-
shirts with “Vote for Flee” on them Except for Flee whose
shirt reads “Chaos was what killed the dinosaurs”

INT COMPUTER LAB — AFTER SCHOOL
Flee and Fat Nat sit at a computer

FLEE
Here’s what I’m thinking we build a
website that lists about five hundred
things like books bands movies TV
shows etc Everyone ranks their top
fifty and we match the people with the
most things in common Then we tell
the couples why they were put together
and they have stuff to talk about
right from the get go You know

Fat Nat nods her head

FLEE (contd)
And the best part about it which
admittedly I didn’t see at first is
that not only will people be grateful
to us for setting them up we get the
pick of the litter I’m gonna take
that hot goth girl When the kids see
me walk in with her on my arm
Bingo So which stud do you want

FAT NAT
Ill probably just go alone Anyone
who gets stuck with me won’t be happy

FLEE
Hey now none of that You’re getting
a date and that’s final
INT CLASSROOM — SIMULTANEOUS

Ms Daniels sits at her desk and prepares to count the votes
which she’s stacked into a single neat pile in front of her
Bufton and two Gods stroll into the room She looks up sees
Bufton and smiles - clearly a bit infatuated with him

MS DANIELS
Hello George how’s my favorite
student

BUFTON

(beat)
I’m sorry I know you’re busy but Ive
got a bit of a problem

MS DANIELS

BUFTON

MS DANIELS

Bufton walks to a corner of the room and Ms Daniels follows
As soon as she gets up one of the Gods grabs the votes off
her desk and puts them in his jacket Another takes a faked
stack out of his coat and sets them down on the desk

EXT BELLS HOUSE - LATER

Sonny and Bell sit in a pair of swings that hang from a large
wooden swing set in her back yard and stare at each other He
leans in to kiss her but Bell with a girlish GIGGLE pushes
herself backwards and starts swinging

BELL
Gotta earn that buddy
SONNY
Name your price
BELL
Whats your favorite all-time CD
SONNY
Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from

Mars

Bell brings her swing to a stop gives him a quick kiss on the
lips and then starts swinging again

SONNY (contd)
That’s all I get

BELL
You want more Tell me more Tell me
something about you that’s shocking
Sonny’s expression suddenly gets super serious so serious
that Bell stops swinging Sonny leans in close to her

SONNY
I’m a soldier from the future sent
back in time to protect you from

Bell pushes Sonny’s swing away from hers and they both LAUGH

BELL
I‘m serious I wanna know everything
about you

SONNY
No You don’t

BELL
I told you the one thing I’ve never
talked to anyone about

Sonny stares off into space for a beat

SONNY
You really wanna know that at my old
school I wouldnt have ever spoken to
you and most likely would’ve picked on
Flee

BELL
You really think I didn’t know you
were a God once

Sonny takes a stick of gum out and starts chewing it

SONNY

So were at a party this summer
getting liquored up when Derek our
Bufton decides we need to teach Mike
Salih a lesson Derek hates Mike for
no other reason than he’s the smartest
guy in school

(beat)
Now it’s common knowledge that Mike
has a phobia of heights and next thing
I know we’re holding him upside down
off a balcony He’s freaking out and
crying and And then Mike pisses his
pants right there in front of the
entire party Most everyone’s laughing
except him and me He’s just hanging
there soaking in his own urine and
staring up at me Christ the look
in his eyes

(spits the gum out)
Here’s the bitch of it when we were
younger Mike and I had been the best
of friends

(MORE)

SONNY (contd)
Its like one minute were playing DandD
together and the next Im helping
torture him I could’ve stopped it I
should‘ve stopped it but If I had
it wouldve gotten me banished from
the in crowd so I chose the cowards
path Funny thing is after that I
didn’t want to be cool anymore and
worst of all I knew I could never
look Mike in the face again

BELL
So you transferred out here

Sonny nods his head

SONNY
We all have a defining moment and
sadly that’s mine

BELL
Youve taken a weird lost little boy
and turned him into a man And
(starts to cry)
And made a broken and bitter girl
Whole and happy again Those
Those are your defining moments

Bell starts to sob Sonny lovingly lowers her head into his
lap and gently strokes her hair

crown

SONNY
Flee

FLEE (contd)
Lets also take a sec to give her
kudos for the amazing job she did
blowing this place up

All eyes turn to Natalie and the entire crowd begins clapping
Natalie blushes and takes a small bow

FLEE (contd)
But most of all we need to thank her
for the unbelievable entertainment she
lined up for us

GEAR 1
yells)
A lousy Ipod ain’t entertainment

FLEE
There always has to be a hater
Though youre right So without
further ado I give you

Flee gives Gay Goth Guy 2 a signal He pulls a rope the
curtains open and standing on stage is

FLEE (contd)
The Killers

BRANDON FLOWERS lead singer of the band walks forward and
grabs the microphone from Flee The crowd stands there in a
stunned SILENCE

BRANDON FLOWERS
This ones for my good friend
Natalie

The band starts to play the kids go berserk and rush the
stage Everyone is in absolute heaven
INT BUFTONS SUV - LATER

Bufton sits in his car fuming and staring at the Elk’s Lodge
He chugs a can of beer and drops it on the floor - next to
five other empty cans After a long beat he grabs a baseball
bat from his back seat and gets out of the car

INT ELK’S LODGE MOMENTS LATER

The kids rock out to the music when a SMASHING NOISE suddenly
rings out The music goes dead and everyone turns to find
Bufton destroying a food table with the bat

Rainey and a few Gears walk over to grab Bufton but he crazily
swings the bat at them and they jump back to avoid it

BUFTON
Ill kill you dead

SONNY
(yells)
Rainey let me do the talking

Sonny heads over and as he does Bufton drunkenly destroys
another food table When he’s done he LAUGHS a crazed laugh

BUFTON
You ruined me over a deuce

SONNY
Not at all Skolnick I thought the
turd-bomb was funny Very original

BUFTON
Then why

SONNY
Because I could
(beat)
Now go get on one of the busses you
drunk jack-ass and Ill have it take
you home before you do something
youll regret in the morning

BUFTON
I’m not leaving until you fight me
like a real man you puss

SONNY
And there it is

FLEE
Come on guys we can

BUFTON
This is a taco and burrito
conversation nachos
SONNY
Combat is a tool of ill omen but if
that’s what you really want Put the
bat down and we’ll rumble Pinche

Bufton throws the bat down and charges over toward him but
Sonny raises his hand to stop him

SONNY (contd)
Gimme a sec to take my shirt off
Don’t wanna get any blood on it

Sonny hands his jacket to Flee and a ring of people quickly
forms around them Sonny takes his shirt off and when he does
we see that he’s totally fucking ripped We also notice that a
pair of gold boxing gloves is tattooed on his chest

FLEE
I thought you never got into fighting

SONNY
I said martial arts boxing is an
entirely different story

FLEE
And your whole “Attack the mind not
the body” thing

SONNY
In the immortal words of Dalton “Be
nice until it’s time not to be nice”

Sonny steps towards Bufton and he moves like a cat on the
prowl He clearly knows his way around a boxing ring

SONNY (contd)
I came to chew bubble gum and kick
ass and Im all out of bubble gum

Sonny throws two lightning fast jabs to Bufton’s face Bufton
swings back but Sonny easily dodges it and counters with a
wicked body blow that sends Bufton stumbling backwards

BUFTON
Ah shit

Bufton rushes forward and swings hard Sonny ducks the punch
and faster than lightening unleashes a crushing roundhouse
Bufton crumbles to the floor and like that the fight is over
Sonny raises his hands above his head in triumph

SONNY
Veni vidi vici

ALLISON
(yells)
I came I saw I conquered
The crowd CHEERS Flee and Rainey help a stunned Bufton to his
feet Sonny proceeds to kick Bufton in the ass

SONNY
Lets have a kick ass dance

The band starts to play again Bufton with tears in his eyes
runs out of the building in humiliation

FLEE
That last bit was hubris And yes I
know it means overbearing arrogance
I looked it up

SONNY
If anyone deserves it he does

FLEE
No one deserves it Wasn’t that the
point of all this

Flee turns and starts to walk away

SONNY

Where are you going

Flee stops

FLEE

Power without compassion is tyranny
SONNY

Thomas Jefferson
FLEE

Jay Entlich
SONNY

Who
FLEE

Me Im Jay Ent Oh never mind

Flee walks off Sonny smiles his wicked little smile and
starts to put his shirt back on

EXT ELK’S LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

Bufton sits against the wall and uses his tie to stop his nose
from bleeding Flee walks up and sits down next to him

BUFTON
Leave me alone

FLEE
Its never as bad as it seems

BUFTON
My life is shit

FLEE
Welcome to how the rest of the world
feels Dont worry though I used to
be a loser like you Now look at me

Bufton gives Flee a look that could kill

FLEE (contd)
Kidding But on a serious note
thisll all blow over and I promise to
get Psycho back so you can win state

BUFTON
The school will never agree to it
FLEE
If you hadnt noticed I can be pretty
resourceful
BUFTON

Why would you want to help me

FLEE
For a long time I thought seeing you
humiliated would make me feel good but
it didn’t Made me sad Sad that I
wanted another person to suffer ‘cuz
Im bigger than that So you can keep
on not liking me if you want but I
refuse to hate you Because a true
man hates no one

Flee puts his hand out and after a beat Bufton shakes it

BUFTON
For what it’s worth I’m sorry

FLEE
A little late for that but there is
something you could do for me

INT ELKS LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

The band finishes a song Bufton walks out on the stage grabs
the microphone and just stares at it for a beat

FLEE (V0)

Bufton had learned his lesson the hard
way and was a better person for it
Well as good a person as that bastard
could be So I did get him Psycho back
and they did win us our first state
championship It was sweet especially
when Buff gave me the game ball

Bufton taps the mic then talks

BUFTON
I‘d like to apologize for being such a
dick tonight I also want to set the
record straight Neither my brother or
I had sex with Shannon Bell at Stacy’s
party freshman year I just said we
did so people would think I was crisp
and for that Bell Im truly sorry

ANGLE ON SONNY FLEE AND BELL

Both Bell and Sonny’s jaws drop

FLEE
I know it doesn’t change what really
happened but at least people will see
you in a kinder light now

Bell tears up hugs and then kisses Flee

BELL
Youre a true king Now if you’1l
excuse me I have to go powder my
nose By which I mean cry

Bell quickly walks off before she loses it
SONNY
I gotta say Jay I’m impressed What
you did for Bell Is one of the
coolest things I’ve ever seen

FLEE
I had a good teacher

SONNY
The student is now the master

FLEE
Thanks For everything

SONNY
It’s what friends do

Flee CHUCKLES

FLEE
Youre my first best friend ever

SONNY
I didn’t say best Wormser

Flee slaps Sonny in the back of the head Both boys smile and
stare at the dance thriving around them

SONNY (contd)
Phase three is now complete

INT ELKS LODGE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Bell fixes her tear streaked make-up in the mirror

FLEE (V0)
Losing the title of school slut let
Bell release all the anger shed been
holding in and she became one of the
happiest least sarcastic nicest
people you could know For the most
part that is

Keri looking drunk and disheveled sits in a stall and drinks
from a flask She puts it back in her purse walks out and
stumbles over to the sink next to Bell

KERI
Bufton’s lie doesn’t change anything
We both still know youre a slut

BELL

Listen here Tara Reid two I don’t
wanna waste any more energy on you so
I’m only saying this once Starting
now you are never going to speak to me
again or I swear to Satan Ill tit—
punch you so hard youll piss milk for
a month Got it

KERI
You don’t scare me

BELL
Yes I do

Bell fakes like she’s gonna punch Keri Keri flinches slips
out of a high heel and drunkenly falls on her ass Several
girls LAUGH Keri angrily looks up at Get-by Girl 1

KERI
What are you laughing at freak

GET-BY GIRL 1
You You bitchy bulimic bimbo
(to her friend)
Is it me or is Bell way more beautiful
than Keri

GET-BY GIRL 2
For Swayze times two

Keri let’s out a SCREAM and Bell smiles ever so slightly

ANGLE ON RAINEY AND ALLISON
They dance slow and close with each other

FLEE (VO)
Allison became quite the wild child
Enjoyed every minute of her senior
year and got so out of control her GPA
dropped from a 40 to a 399 Rainey
on the other hand with Allison’s
help turned into a model student and
actually got himself into college

ALLISON
Riding your hog made me feel hot and
Id like to ride it again but I don’t
necessarily mean the mechanical one

RAINEY
You trying to talk dirty to me

ALLISON
That assumption would be correct Now
you say something to rev my engine
Rainey smiles big
RAINEY
Theres a plethora of things Id like
to do to your whiz-bang little body

Allison sucks in her breath in excitement

ALLISON
Plethora Say it again

RAINEY
I’1ll do you one better Myriad

Allison looks like she’s about to orgasm

ANGLE ON THE STAGE

The band finishes another song Sonny walks out and whispers
in Brandon Flower’s ear

BRANDON FLOWERS
I hear theres one piece of business
still to be finished so I nominate
Flee and Natalie as your homecoming
king and queen

EVERYONE
(chanting over and over)
Flee and Natalie Flee and Natalie

BRANDON FLOWERS
Sounds unanimous to me Come on up
here you two

FLEE (V0)
And that as unbelievable as it may
seem is how the fat girl and the
weird kid were crowned king and queen

Fat Nat and Flee walk onto the stage From the wings Gay Goth
Guy 1 and 2 run out and put those paper crowns you get from
Burger King onto each of their heads

BRANDON FLOWERS
The royal dance

The band starts to play
ANGLE ON FAT NAT

The camera follows her as she looks for a dance partner

FLEE (V0O)
Once everyone found out Natalie was
in fact friends with a rockstar her
popularity sky rocketed And with a
little positive attention she
blossomed into a totally cool
confident and kick-ass person

Fat Nat stops in front of Bufton who sits in a chair looking
sorry for himself

FAT NAT
Care to dance

BUFTON
Fine

Fat Nat takes his hand and leads him off to dance The camera
pans to find an unhappy looking Keri standing all by herself

FLEE (VO)
Poor poor Keri ended up being the
only girl at the dance without a date
I guess some people really do get what
they deserve

Keri stamps her foot on the floor like a petulant child

ANGLE ON FLEE AND REBEKAH

The two dance and once again it’s like poetry in motion

r FLEE (V0)
As for me let’s just say I got to do
more than see a girl’s twinkle I got
to tickle it if you know what I mean

REBEKAH
God youre an amazing dancer I bet

FLEE
Well Actually I’m Sort of
Kind of Pretty much A virgin
REBEKAH

Not for long
Flee’s jaw drops and he starts to sweat

INT RV - FLASH FORWARD

The RV is PITCH BLACK and we can’t see much but we can hear
the sounds of two people fooling around

FLEE (V0)
Boy was I nervous Losing one’s
virginity is no small thing and
speaking of small things Hell I
can’t even put into words what

see for yourselves

REBEKAH (0S)

Flee turns a light on He and Rebekah lie in bed Rebekah
holds a rubber in her hand and looks like shes seen a ghost

FLEE

penis How ironic is that

CASHIER
Hi Flee

FLEE

CASHIER
The Magnums

FLEE

boxes gonna be a long night Pun

Flee winks and the Cashier blushes

ANGLE ON SONNY AND BELL - BACK TO REAL TIME

Bell tries to drag Sonny out dancing but he fights it

FLEE (VO)
Last but not least Sonny He had
sought to exile himself from the world
but ended up finding the woman who
would become his wife and meeting his
best lifelong friend instead Lifes
funny like that sometimes

SONNY
I can’t dance alright

No one’s perfect

BELL

love you imperfections and all

SONNY
Mon amour quand je regarde ton visage
mon coeur bat plus fort

BELL
Just Just say you love me too

SONNY

She starts to retort but Sonny grabs Bell and kisses her slow
soft and deep

SONNY (contd)
I love you Shannon

BELL
Then dance with me Shue

Sonny starts to refuse but now Bell kisses him Sonny smiles
and shakes his head

SONNY
You asked for it

Sonny leads Bell out onto the dance floor Theyre surrounded
by Flee and Rebekah Fat Nat and Bufton and Rainey and
Allison They start to dance and Sonny really really does
suck After a beat the entire school joins them

INT ELKS LODGE - CONTINUOUS

A wide shot of all the students of Robert Frost High dancing
and having fun not as separate clans but as one group

FLEE (VO)
In a land not very far away there is a
tiny kingdom known as Robert Frost
High Unlike most high schools it has
no distinct cliques or clans just
friends and equals

FADE TO BLACK
