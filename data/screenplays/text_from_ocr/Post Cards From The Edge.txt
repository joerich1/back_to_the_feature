The Senior Officer slaps Mary hard sending her halfway
across the room where she lands with her head down -

SENIOR OFFICER
Did you think that your affair
with a government official would
go unnoticed We are not fools
Miss DuBois

Mary slowly turns her head regarding the Officer
steadily Her lip is bleeding Her demeanor is com-
pletely transformed She is no longer a midwestern
Carol Burnett dingbat but Marianne DuBois heroic
political mole

MARIANNE
Thats your best evidence for not
being foolish You wish you were
foolish -- foolish should be a
goal of yours But youre not
even a fool youre nothing more
than a thug a second-rate thug

The Officer starts toward Marianne as if to strike her
again

MARIANNE

Go ahead hit me But we will
survive We have more spirit and
more resources than you
MORE)

MARIANNE (CONTD)
All itll cost us is money while

Marianne pauses A look of consternation flashes
across her face One of the guards starts to break
causing the Senior Officer to blow Finally Marianne
starts laughing

MARTANNESUZANNE

SUZANNE
(laughing)

You shut up Raoul All you have

A bearded man walks INTO THE SHOT and walks over to
Suzanne This is the director LOWELL

SUZANNE
continuing)
Im sorry Lowell -- can you use
any of it No of course you

LOWELL

up to that point

SUZANNE
I told you you should never give
me inches of talk One inch at
the most but inches and inches -
its like a nightmare

LOWELL
Youre one of the few actresses I
know that doesnt like acting
And youre so good at it

CONTINGED The crew has started wandering around Suzanne
invisibly signals her stand-in a girl barely notice

able standing by a camera

SUZANNE
I dont like acting as much as I
like hanging around sets

LOWELL
You should be a grip

SUZANNE
I would but I don’t like beer

Speaking of which can I go to the

mens room before we start again

LOWELL
You bet

FIRST AD
Everybody get back to one Were
going again

The SOUNDMAN comes and checks Suzannes body mike as

she talks to Lowell

SOUNDMAN

Try not to hit your chest when you

do that last speech Suzanne

SUZANNE
Listen Jerry Im lucky to get

through that speech at all -- if I

have to hit my chest to do it
forgive me

The Soundman with Suzanne looks at another soundman

seated behind a recorder who is laughing at

what

Suzanne is saying We hear the last part of her

dialogue through his headphones (cans)

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Youd hit my chest too if you had
this speech

Hair and makeup come to touch Suzanne up

BOBBY (FIRST AD)
Lets go people -- work with us
- get back to your marks as
quickly and quietly as possible

Lowell has gone over to the video TV and is watching
the take on video

SUZANNE

(to hair and makeup)
Maybe I shouldnt go to the
bathroom Maybe I should somehow
use it in the scene -- No really
I could play it as though Marianne
had to go to the bathroom aside
from everything else it would
play much faster I Gont know
maybe Im still in character
Sometimes I cant tell

MAKEUP
(smiling shaking
his head)
Wacko Definitely wacko

SUZANNE
Ill be right back

Suzanne makes her way through the crew regrouping for
the next shot

CAMERAMAN
Re-load
SUZANNE
You can say that again
CAMERAMAN
I probably will after the next
shot
SUZANNE
Only if I make it all the way
through

Suzanne is very popular with the crew They clearly
like her and think shes funny

Suzanne slips into the ladies room The door closes
and an instant later her stand-in slips out

We GO BACK to the soundman with the headphones around
his neck Through them we hear someone snorting
cocaine Both soundmen look at each other knowingly
One puts a finger up to his nose He hears the SOUND
of a TOILET FLUSHING THROUGH the HEADPHONES

Lowell is directing the Senior Officer

LOWELL
It was very good Raoul This
time you know when you say Miss
DuBois try not to punch it

quite as hard Be more victorious

with your discovery than ominous
Youre plenty ominous as it is

RAOUL
Yes sir

Suzanne re-emerges from the bathroom

SUZANNE

Is the airplane in this shot - oF

her nose)
Show business is my life -

A blood ampule is thrust deep into her mouth

(MORE)

LOWELL (CONTD)

Now there are a lot of people
here trying to work together to
make this a good movie I expect
you to pull yourself together for
these last couple of days on this
film and work with us or Ill
kill you I11 kill you before
you kill yourself And Iil do a
better job ‘cause youre so out of
it youd probably even botch that
up Now do you think you can do
the scene straight through this
time

Suzanne just Looks at him humiliated and dumbfounded

LOWELL

continuing)
Try to use the humiliation in the
scene itll give you more depth
Use your vulnerability instead o£
making jokes to cover it up Or
taking drugs One more hit of
cocaine on this picture and Im
going to make sure that everyone
in this town who doesnt already
know knows what a fuck up you
are TIli ruin you forever And
then Ill kill you

Suzanne nods the smallest of nods

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY 10

A woman is running down the hallway wailing every
thing flying - purse wig askew blouse untucked
false eyelashes removed Clearly this woman was caught
mid-something for the apparent emergency She is DORIS
MANN about 60 formerly beautiful and more than some—
what currently She was an enormous star in the 50s
and 60s and bears that mark o

She is currently very upset theatrically so Cutting
a wide swath as she makes her way down the hall --
things dropping out of her purse mostly makeup - a
pack of cigarettes People watch her as she moves by
moving aside to avoid impact Doris Mann is very up-
set Perhaps she has lost a shoe

DORIS
My baby my baby

She is breathless
INT EMERGENCY ROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER ll

Suzanne is unconscious following her procedure She is
Still being monitored An IV runs into her arm

Suzannes mother Doris Mann has flung herself across
her daughters inert form

There is something childlike about Doris at the same
time as she is theatrical She is far from a monster
as many stars from her generation have been depicted
She is tough but at the same time touching almost
adorable She is a product of complete self-invention
Dirt poor to rich and famous Though the Following has
a touch of theatricality about it almost as though
done for the two nurses there should be no doubt
about Doris sincere feelings and concern for Suzanne

Several NURSES try to comfort her

NURSE A
Shes resting comfortably Miss
Mann She should be (fine)

DORIS

How did this happen I was a good
mother I had my career but I
was there She had a happy
childhood JI can prove it -- I

if youll just —

DORIS

Unlike her alleged father who was -
never there just like hes not

DORIS
Of course not Hes not here

Suzanne in)
At least shes sleeping now

You never could sleep could you

Thats my girl

SUZANNES DREAM

Suzanne is wandering down a hospital hallway There
are pictures on the wall Marilyn Monroe Lenny Bruce
Elvis Presley Montgomery Clift Judy Garland Jimi
Hendrix Janis Joplin John Belushi Jim Morrison She
regards them curiously Suddenly she sees the nurses
station It is empty She looks around to make sure
the coast is clear then makes her way to an enormous
medicine cabinet which she carefully opens It is
£illed with pills She starts dumping them into her
hands -- but then she looks down and her hospital gown
has no pockets to put the pills in She panics that
someone is coming A woman rounds the corner catching
Suzanne in the act The woman is Nancy Reagan

INT SUZANNES HOSPITAL ROOM

Suzanne wakes up horrified sweating from her drean
A therapist JULIE is standing at the edge of her
bed She is middle-aged dressed rather youthfully
with dark hair and very long red nails She smokes
Lueky Strikes She is the queen bee in this rehabili-
tation hive She carries a pad and pencil

JOLIE
Nasty dream Everybody has those
Youll have them for a while

SUZANNE
(ironic)
Great

Juiie walks over and opens the drapes

JULIE
(briskly)
Im Julie Marsden Director of the
Dawn of New Hope Rehabilitation
Program Im here to admit you

SUZANNE
Nice to meet you

JULTE
Your blood work was done up in the
emergency room the other night
Since youve been basically
sleeping since then -- were going
to have to find out a couple of
things before we officially admit
you to the unit

SUZANNE
Shoot

JULIE
All right well start

She refers to her notes ona clipboard as she sits in
a chair at the end of Suzannes bed

JULIE

(continuing)
Approximately how long have you

been a drug addict

Suzanne looks at Julie blankly

SUZANNE
A drug addict

JULIE
Youve admitted yourself into a
drug and alcohol rehabilitation
unit Surely that implies some
sort of drug problem

SUZANNE
Drug problem Yeah I guess but
not not a drug addict See I
never took any one drug
(MORE)

( )

2) 13

SUZANNE (CONTD)
(thinks a beat)
I guess that makes me a drugs
addict huh My doctor told me I
didnt so much have a serious drug
problem as a drug problem 1 should
take seriously
JULIE
(raises her eyebrows)
I see And did you

SUZANNE
What

JULIE
Take it seriously

SUZANNE
I guess so I got here You
cant get much more serious than
this

Julie makes a note

JULIE
Did you deliberately try to take
your life

Suzanne is affronted

SUZANNE
(flabbergasted)
What
JULIE
You know kill yourself suicide
overdose
SUZANNE
No
JULIE

Im sorry if my question offends
you but having to have your
stomach pumped indicates fairly
suicidal behavior 13

SUZANNE
Well the behavior might be but
Im certainly not I always
describe my drug taking as taming
the beast When I go to someones
house I go to their bathroom run
the water and go into their
medicine cabinet If they have
pain killers -- I take them
Theyre mine I usually leave a
few Im like Robin Hood I take
from the straight and give to the
potentially stoned Me

Julie makes a note

JULIE
Do you always have to be funny

SUZANNE
No Not unless its a very
serious situation Then its
necessary I think they call it
gallows humor This way to the
gas ladies and gentlemen

JULIE
(interrupts)
Youre going to have to learn to
handle a reality without drugs

SUZANNE
Hey you teach me how to identify
it Ill try to learn how to
handle it

JULIE
Everybody has their own particular
reality Only you can identify
yours

SUZANNE
Well then were both out of luck
tm in the business of fantasy
My familys in the business of

fantasy - Fantasy is my reality
JULIE

Why did you go into show business

then i3

SUZANNE

I didnt go into it -- Ive never
been out of it But -

(Suzanne puts up her

index finger)
I have a plan I am planning an
escape I am tunneling out of
show business Digging under all
the major studios Say do we
get any medicine to help us come
off drugs

Julie gives her a look

Suzannes

JULIE
I want you to know that I know
youre scared and that this is the
place to handle it

eyes £111 with tears

SUZANNE
(humiliated)
I dont understand how I almost
died That was never what Tf
wanted to do

JULIE
What did you want to do

SUZANNE
(shrugs)
Just get out of everything

JULIE
Thats very different isnt it

SUZANNE
Can you tell me what to do

JULIE
Thats your first step to recovery
-- is to recognize that you dont
know That your best thinking got
you into an emergency room But
weve all been there Here were
all recovering addicts and
alcoholics Ive been clean for
thirteen years Off heroin

INT DRUG REHABILITATION HOSPITAL - NIGHT 14

An oversized hospital room which serves as the family
therapy room or movie room OF cafeteria

Family night at the Dawn of New Hope Drug and Alcohol
Rehabilitation Center in Century City

Patients are seated in a circle on cafeteria chairs
with two chairs in the middle In the hot seat center
chairs) are ROB an agent and his wife CAROL the
cocaine addict JIM a therapist is conducting the
session He is an attractive large black man in his
thirties Rob is impeccably dressed down to his
socks

He is an ambitious workaholic whose manner is arrogant
and cold Carol is a nervous gentle girl who is intim-
idated by her husband She chain smokes Other
addicts and their families sit and watch Carol and Rob
in the hot seat

JIM
(goodnaturedly)
Its nice to see you here again
Rob

ROB
Id like to say its nice to be
here Jim but

JIM
I know it must be very unpleasant
for you to have to deal with all
this

ROB
Of course its not pleasant but
Carol feels that its important
for me to participate so I come

JIM
I see But its difficult for you
to see the point is that it

ROB
Of course not Its just that as
you know this is Carols second
visit with you people and the
first time I came down here
happily

Carol laughs ironically and rolls her eyes
Suzanne watches Rob and Carol intently

JIM
Why are you laughing Carol
CAROL
Huh
JIM

When Rob said he came down here
happily the last time you
laughed Why was that

CAROL
laughs again)
Oh I dont know

ROB
(confrontive)
What Carol

CAROL
(reluctantly)
Nothing I dont know I never
felt you were happy to come here
at all is all

ROB
Thats not true dear Tf
specifically remember you noticing
how involved I was last time
This time admittedly Im not
quite as enthusiastic I have a
lot more work that is impossible
to interrupt as easily as last
time and I know I dont have to
remind you that when we married we
had an understanding that my work
came first You said that you
could live with that arrangement
You know how important it is for
me to devote a lot of time to my
job in order to do well And
certainly you benefit from my
success Dont I give you
everything you want Dont we
live in a nice house All I ask
from you in return is a little
support and some peace and quiet
while I read my scripts on Sunday

As this dialogue continues the group looks very uncom-
fortable squirming in their seats particularly the
women and most particularly Suzanne

( ) 14
CAROL

(barely audible)
I know I just

She trails off awkwardly wishing she were dead or

invisible

Carol can

ROB
What Tell me Carol Im nota
mind reader Im sorry Im not
able to be more attentive while
youre in here Didnt we go to
Barbados last year for Christmas
Didnt I say you could re-decorate
the house this year But now in
light of the expense of the
clinic Im not sure if thats
still feasible

CAROL
(mortified)
I know but

JIM
Is there something youd like to
communicate to Rob Carol

hardly speak There are tears in her eyes

CAROL
Nothing really important

JIM

to group)
Who here thinks Carol is having
trouble communicating with Rob

Group raises hands

CARL
Someone ought to bust him in the
jaw
JIM

Now Carl These random outbursts
of yours do no one any good

ROB
I dont really see how this process
is of any benefit at all Publicly
airing ones difficulties -

( ) 14

JIM
interrupts gently)
Does anyone here think they could
communicate with Rob in Carols
place

Suzanne who has been looking furious on Carols be-
half raises her hand

JIM
(continuing)
Good for you Suzanne Rob this
is Suzanne who will be sitting in
for Carol Suzanne and Carol why
dont you trade seats

Suzanne and Carol trade seats

SUZANNE
(nervous)
Bi ’ Rob
ROB

Good evening

Jim stands to one side watching The rest of the
junkies look on breathlessly or not

ROB
(continuing)
Well

Caroli watches fearfully from Suzannes seat

Suzanne starts out haltingly and gains confidence as
she continues

SUZANNE
This is my first post overdose
performance so bear with me
(clears her throat)

I wouldnt feel comfortable telling
you how I felt Id be afraid I
might get it wrong f might make a
mistake and say the wrong feeling
and then youd correct me You
talk to me like Ima child So
officious and grand I can feel
you massing on my borders a Little
backward country with a superpower
poised for takeover Russia to my
Finland The implication is that
my way is wrong that I cant do
it Its like dope

(MORE)

SUZANNE (CONTD)
I dont mean thats why I take it
but thats what it does It takes
you over you lose control Tt
doesnt let you take care of
yourself Like you You dont
tet me take care of myself by
implying that I cant never
could By implying that you - or
anyone - could do it better
Nothing I do pleases you so I do
nothing to please you anymore
Ill spell relief any way I can
I cant be perfect like you Tf
use drugs to take me out of the
game iI dont want to play if i
cant win With you I always feel
wrong and stupid and young 1
cant win As long as I stay sick
I give you something to be As
long as Im not good enough youre
better I doubt myself to the
degree that youre sure Well
get this Im sick of playing down
to your up failure to your
success Stop looking at my
faults as a means of not dealing
with your own Feeling superior
to me doesnt make you someone
Youre Doctor Frankenstein and
Im your monster Frankenstoned
Get off my back As long as you
take care of me Ill never take
care of myself Find a hobby get
a night job become a Big Brother
Just leave me to myself Get a
life

Suzanne stops embarrassed Jim rescues her

Rob looks

JIM
Thank you Suzanne You make a
very lively Carol

a little stunned Carol looks a little

pleased and a little frightened

JIM
(continuing)
Why doesnt everybody go
downstairs and visit with their
significant others --

CARL
(interrupts)
Their what

JIM
Their families spouses or lovers
You have about fifteen minutes to
visit Carol and Rob I’d like
you to stay behind and talk for a
moment if you would

The group begins to disperse and move eut of the room

Julie who has been watching Suzanne sit in for Carol
motions her over to one side

Suzannes new drug hospital pal ARETHA waits for 15
her BART and ALLEN two other family night partici-
pants sit talking

JULIE
That was very good Suzanne
Anger makes you eloquent You

showed genuine feeling for the
first time here

SUZANNE
Im always better as other people

JULIE
Why are you so afraid of feeling
in yourself

SUZANNE
(uncomfortable)
Im a better thinker than a
feeler I guess Im just leading
with my strength

JULIE
Maybe this strength just hides a
weakness

SUZANNE

Oh Christ why does everything

Julie just looks at her Suzanne realizes what she has
said -- where she is

SUZANNE

You know what I mean

JULIE
Deal with your feelings Suzanne
- before they deal with you

SUZANNE
Do you always talk in bumper
stickers -- or is that just on the

solution - but until you remove
this solution you cant see
clearly what the problem is This

DORIS

like what theyre doing for you
Careers need planning Your
problem is youre too impatient
Youre only interested in instant
gratification

SUZANNE
Instant gratification takes too
long

DORIS

(not hearing her)
But I dont want you to think
about any of this now Im
handling everything while youre
in here No pressure I want you

Oh dear look at me 1 promised
myself I wouldnt do this and now

upset JI hate getting upset 1f
just hate for you to go through
this is all I wish I could do it
for you I never wanted you to go
through any pain I tried so hard
to shield you protect you I
always worried that Id lose you
That youd be taken from me early

SUZANNE
As opposed to later when it would
be more convenient

DORIS
Golly are you tough Just like
Grandma Always judging me
Youve never forgiven me -

Hospital office Julie sits at a desk with her chair
facing Suzanne and Doris who sit in other chairs

They have just begun a meeting Julie has begun
explaining something to Suzanne

(

JULIE
So the upshot of the whole thing
is that having been so recently
in a clinic youre a very high
risk for a movie

SUZANNE
But they want me to do the movie
I talked to the director and --

JULIE
The director isnt the problem
Its the insurance company They
refuse to cover you in the event
you do drugs (and alcohol)

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
Im not going to do drugs and
alcohol

DORTS
We know that dear But these are
businessmen who have no knowledge
of creative personalities Actors
are not treated well and
actresses are treated like
Well I hate to say the word
but shit Why I remember when
I was fifteen years old Mr Mayer
called me in for a meeting and he
was on the toilet and we had to
conduct the meeting with him on
the toilet You can be sure he
wouldnt have done that to John

Garfield
SUZANNE
(irritated)
Mom
DORIS
(to Julie)
My daughter doesnt like to talk
to me
JULIE
Miss Mann maybe Id better handle
this
DORIS

Of course Shell listen to you
- youre not her mother 21

JULIE
Unfortunately other actresses and
actors have not come to work due
to a drug and alcohol problem and
its cost the insurance company 4
lot of money Try to see it from
their point of view

SUZANNE
t do see Im being punished

JULIE
There is a difference between
punishment and accepting the
consequences of our actions

DORIS
What comes around goes around
dear

SUZANNE

(to her mother)
How do you figure having my
stomach pumped going around to my
not working again

JULIE
Suzanne if youll let me finish
youll see its not all bad news

SUZANNE
(sulking to herself)
What comes around goes around

JULIE
I talked to the insurance company
this morning and theyve agreed to
cover you if you stay with a
responsible party for the duration
of the film

SUZANNE
Meaning what I should stay here
Punch out in the morning and in at
night

JULIE
Its not quite that extreme
Suzanne They thought it would be
appropriate to stay with one or
both parents since your father
lives in New York your mother
said you could stay with her

(

21 21
Suzanne looks totally confused

SUZANNE
Excuse me

DORIS
She couldnt stay with her father
anyway Hes worse than she is
to Suzanne)
Not that youre bad dear

SUZANNE
Stay with my mother What am I
A teenager

DORIS
Dear I lived with my mother and
father til I was twenty-three
and we all shared one bathroom

JULIE
Suzanne maybe it would be better
to wait a couple of months to go
back to work Go to your AA
meetings and when youre feeling
better equipped to deal with the
world

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
But I want to do this film I can
go to meetings and work I do
better when I work I feel like I
belong I feel necessary I know
how to do that

DORIS

Shes just like me when I was her
age I did film after film I
never stopped It was wonderful
therapy after my divorce and my
miscarriages Of course in those
days the material was better

(to Suzanne)
I think dear to do a cop film at
this point in your career is a
poor choice Youve just done an
interesting political film dont
you think now it would be wiser to
relax and compose yourself like
Julie suggests

SUZANNE
(But) I want to work now

DORIS

You should let Dr Feldman look at

one the size of a grapefruit

(sighs)
My own daughter wont even listen
to me If only youd change back
to my business manager I bet

would

SUZANNE
Im going to kill myself 28

DORTS
Dont even say that in jest

youve gotten out of a drug
clinic People might take it the
wrong way

EXT DORIS MANNS ENCINO HOME - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 29

Doris and Suzanne drive up Many cars are in the

It looks as though theres a party
going on

DORIS

Suzanne looks mortified

Her grandparents are there PEARL and OWEN as is her
housekeepernanny MARY a black woman about the same
age as her mother Her grandmother is seventy-five
Suzannes stepfather Sid Roth sits drinking and
watching television Sid essentially never speaks
Suzannes grandmother Pearl is an extremely critical
woman Her grandfather Owen has the beginnings of
Alzheimers Disease and doesnt quite know where he
is but has a general idea that he wishes that his wife
(or whoever she is wasnt there too

30

All converge on Suzanne Except Sid who watches TV and
Owen who smokes and perhaps plays some senile version
of solitaire

EXT DORIS MANNS HOME SEVERAL HOURS LATER 31

Suzanne stands outside with Aretha looking in through
the windows at the assembled guests Suzanne is
eating Suzanne eats a lot now Candy potato chips
Coca Cola

SUZANNE
(chewing)

I mean there are people here I
havent seen since high school
Nor would I want to Louis
Karasik for chrissakes Where
did she come up with Louis Karasik
-- the last time I saw him he
threw up scrambled eggs out of his
nose on the way to the library

ARETHA
He looks like that guy at the (AA)
meeting

SUZANNE

Wouldnt it be fabulous if my
whole class ended up in AA making
coffee cleaning up praying

Suzannes grandparents Pearl and Owen come out onto
the patio Owen is holding an empty can of cashew
nuts

PEARL
Let me look at you Lovebug

hauls her rear off to bed

Pearl smells Suzanne as she embraces her

PEARL

Owen wanders back into the house singing

Pearl shakes her head

OWEN
(continuing)
And the farmer hauled another load
away
PEARL

The other day he punched me when I
was trying to put some clean
pajamas on him

(embraces Suzanne)
Well babydoll Im gonna

(to Aretha)
You ought to eat more young lady

soap after a hard days wash

(to Suzanne)
Good night sugar Have to let

Pearl exits Suzanne looks at Aretha

SUZANNE
I have nothing to say

ARETHA
The same cant be said for the
rest of your family Whats the
matter with your grandfather

SUZANNE
Psychologically my grandmother -—
medically Alzheimers A very bad
combination He seems to be
Losing every part of his brain
except for the one that realizes
that the rest of it is going And
what he doesnt notice she points
out As though hes doing it
deliberately Like Alzheimers is
an evil vice

( )

(2 31

ARETHA
He should go to a senility detox
unit They could send him to
meetings with other Alzheimer
victims

SUZANNE
AA Alzheimers Anonymous So
anonymous even you dont know who
you are Hi Im and Im
Im uh Hi Im whatre we
talking about

Suzanne laughs

Doris drama coach SYLVIA RICHTER comes out of the
house and joins them on the patio Sylvia is ninety
years old and very dramatic Doris is very like Sylvia
sometimes

SYLVIA
There you are Suzanne darling
Well dear I was just saying to
your mother that your taking the
cure makes up for everything
Give me a kiss good night dear

Sylvia embraces Suzanne roughly

SYLVIA

(continuing)
You remind me so much of your
mother as a young girl in this
light -- it makes me want to weep
In those early days at the studio
when she first came to me for
elocution lessons As soon as she
walked in the door I knew she was
going to be an enormous star
Just as I knew it about you dear
when your mother brought you out
at parties and you did the twist

Mary comes out of the house
MARY
Miss Suzanne your mama wants you
inside to cut the cake

Suzanne looks at Aretha What cake

INT DORIS MANNS LIVING ROOM 32

Suzanne stands in front of a cake of her face with
candles around it She blows out the candles which
had essentially made her hair look like it was on Fire
Doris embraces her daughter proudly Suzanne looks
exhausted

A very gay-looking OLDER MAN starts up a chant

GARY
Sing something Suzanne

A large body of the group murmur “Yes Yes sing

SUZANNE
(humiliated)
No really please I cant

DORIS
Cmon sweetheart Do one of your
old numbers from my act

SUZANNE
No Mama really
DORIS
Just one number to please your old
mother
INT DORIS MANNS LIVING ROOM - SOME MOMENTS LATER 33

Suzanne is standing next to the piano singing Doris
accompanist ROGER accompanies Her voice is soulful
beautiful She holds onto the piano for dear life

She is almost visibly trembling She keeps her eyes
trained on the ground

Doris’ face is a mixture of emotions from pride to
envy Sometimes she mouths the words to the song with
her daughter She occasionally shushes the other
guests even if they arent talking As Suzanne fin-
ishes her ballad Doris is in tears Suzanne is miser-
able She finishes and gives her mother a helpless
caught look

The song she sings is a ballad like If I Loved You
Skylark or Better Luck Next Time a yearning sad
song

SUZANNE
«« SO dont say
Better luck next time
That could never be
Because there aint gonna be
No next time for me

33 33

All are visibly moved The room explodes in applause
Deris runs to her daughters side embracing her

DORIS
That was lovely dear I dont
know why you dont sing anymore

SUZANNE
I get so nervous

DORIS
But you shouldnt be Youve got
a terrific voice -- a terrific

talent - a much bigger talent
than mine

Now Gary starts another chant

GARY
Now Doris Doris sing something

The room chimes in once again Yes Oh yes

DORIS
No no I couldnt Really its
my daughters night

SUZANNE
(knowing she wants to)
Go on Mama Sing

DORIS
(to Suzanne)
You think I should

SUZANNE
Yes

DORIS
All right You sang for me I11
Sing for you
(to Roger)
Gee But Its Good To Be Here —-
in Aflat

Doris wows them with her song completely eclipsing
Suzanne She is a true performer - Loving it born to
do it Nerves of steel she plays completely to the
crowd

Suzanne watches The room is electrified whipped up
as they can only be in the face of a great and true
entertainer 33

DORIS

(continuing)
Ive been to Reno
Ive been to Beverly Hills
And Im here
Reefer and vino
Tve done ‘em all and my dear
Im still here
Ive stood in bread lines
with the best
Watched while the headlines
did the rest
In the depression
was I depressed
Nowhere near
got through all of last year
and Im here

She finishes on top of the piano the assembled company
cheering We HOLD on Suzannes happy defeated face
Doris casts a long shadow

INT SUZANNES ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER 34

The party has dispersed Suzanne has miraculously
escaped She enters and closes the door behind her
looking enormously exhausted and relieved She moves
to the sink intending to prepare for bed

A voice startles her from a chair in the corner of the
room

TONY
Hi baby

Suzanne jumps in fright and looks around seeing her
father TONY VALE seated in the chair He stands He
is in his late £ifties short dark and formerly hand
some He has tremendous boyish charm

SUZANNE
Jesus Daddy dont do that -- ya

TONY

TONY
That was your mother’s fault I

Palm Springs or somewhere Ugh
Im defending myself and I dont

Tony climbs out of the window as Suzanne looks on

35 INT CAR - THE NEXT MORNING 35
Suzanne is dressed and made up about to do a chase
scene through the desert in the rain The soundman is
putting a mike in the car

( )

ROGER the hair dresser wets down her hair SIMON the
English director approaches and crouches down next to
Suzannes open car door He looks embarrassed

SIMON
Hello darling

SUZANNE
Hey Simon

He locks at his hands The soundman finishes and walks
away

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Whats happening Did you have to
take a drug test too

Simon looks confused

SIMON
Oh no no no Its nothing
really They just the
producers saw the rushes last
night and had some rather
interesting notes

Roger gives Suzanne one last spritz sees that Simon
wants to talk to Suzanne privately and discreetly re-
moves himself Suzanne tries to seem calm

SUZANNE
Well what

STMON
Now don’t take it the wrong way
IT saw them this morning and you
were fine

SUZANNE
(gloomily)
It was my first day

SIMON

(emphatically)
It was your first day absolutely
I couldnt agree with you more
The producers simply felt you
should have fun with it

(he smiles)
Just have more fun with it thats
all

2) 35

SUZANNE
Simon if I knew how to have fun
with stuf£ I wouldnt be in
therapy I wouldnt need to take
drug tests

STMON
Now now I think they had some
very interesting comments Maybe
Im not saying it properly What
I think they meant is that you
could own your performance Make
it more your own Just sort of
have fun

Suzanne stares at her feet

SUZANNE
(sarcastically)
Really And here I thought
everything I did had to be fraught
with incredible torment This is
amazing Why didnt one of my
shrinks tell me this

SIMON
(patiently)
Now Suzanne you shouldnt be in
this business if you cant take
criticism

Suzanne stares at her feet

SUZANNE
But Simon please Have fun with
it Dont you think I would do
that with everything I did if it
was at all possible

Simon puts his arm around Suzanne

SIMON
I know you can do this part Just
relax into it Be yourself and
youll be wonderful

Simon kisses the top of Suzannes head and walks off to
talk to BUDDY the DP as Ted arrives with a can of
Diet Coke

TED
Nutrasweets for the sweet 35

SUZANNE
You know what I think Actors are
the lowest of the low Unless
they have box office in which
case theyre treated with respect
without being respected

Suzanne takes a swig of soda and pulls a candy bar out
of her pocket taking the wrapper off and taking a big
bite

SUZANNE
(continuing)
At least with me theres an
honest level of contempt They
dont respect me and they dont
treat me with respect

Ted nods sympathetically

TED
You ought to be an assistant
director if you want to sample the
motherlode of contempt And
preferably a second assistant
director

Ted takes Suzannes arm

TED
(continuing)
We need to get you touched up
Youre in the next shot

ExT BACK LOT OF STUDIO - THAT AFTERNOON 36

Suzanne is headed to the prop truck She moves through
the warm hum of the crew as they check lights change
lenses position extras She is humming Gee But Its
Good To Be Here as she arrives at the prop truck for
her Diet Coke As she rounds the corner of the truck
heading for the metal steps at the back Suzanne almost
collides with NEIL BLEENE the youngest of the
producers

NEIL
stepping aside)
Well fancy meeting you here
Neil Bleene associate producer

Suzanne smiles a startled smile and goes up the steps
She gets a Coke out of the ice chest opens it and
stands on the edge of the truck looking down on Neil
Bleene

36 36

SUZANNE
I understand my enjoyment levels
are down

Neil looks at his shoes and clears his throat

NEIL
Well no we felt the performance
was fine but
(he searches for
the right word)
Youre holding something back

SUZANNE
repeats solemnly)
Holding something back

NEIL
It felt like you werent that
you didnt make a choice You
made a non-choice Like you were
concentrating more on not doing
something than on doing something

SUZANNE
I see

NEIL
Ive been in theatre Ive also
directed theatre Im producing
this basically to make money Im
actually a theatre director From
what I was told you spontaneously
hit Bobby during a rehearsal and
Simon stopped you I dont think
he should stop your impuises The
other thing is that sometimes
certain line readings are
appropriate like in comedy its
a rule that inflections go up at
the end

Suzanne kneels down to look in Neils eyes

SUZANNE
Theres a comedy rule

Neil runs his hands through his hair

NEIL
Well theres not necessarily
rules so much as guidelines
(beat)
You were very good in Public
Domain What did you do there 36

SUZANNE
(defensive)

I had Benjamin Keller as my
director and Magda Valnepov as my
coach Tf didnt have fun with
it We had a month of
Tehearsals We worked very
hard We hardly ever relaxed

Suzanne stops realizing shes gotten pretty defensive

and loud

SUZANNE

continuing calmer
Look I may not take criticism
well but that doesnt mean Im
not hearing it Right now Im
storing it in my delayed response
area because its hard for me T
wish I was someone who welcomed
criticism and immediately
understood its value but Im not
and if I look unhappy about this
Iam Ive had one day of work on
this and this is my second
conversation about whats missing
in my performance

NEIL
(shaking his head)
Were talking about two minutes of
film Two minutes of screen time
out of ninety

SUZANNE
Is it correctable

NEIL
(reassuringly)
Come on its net as though you
farted during all your dialogue
and we all sat in rushes and said
Whats that noise all over her
lines

SUZANNE
ironically)
Im so relieved That analogy has
bathed me in relief

Suzanne jumps down off the prop truck careful not to

spill her

Coke

( 36

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Thanks for the acting tips and the
pep talk Im feeling much more
relaxed now

Suzanne heads back in the direction of the set leaving
Neil and his leather pants at the prop truck

We FOLLOW Suzanne as she takes a swig of soda and
rounds another corner of a truck This is the wardrobe
truck As she approaches the back of it she hears
what turns out to be Simons voice Suzanne slows
eavesdropping on the ongoing conversation She pulls a
bag of honey roasted cashews out of her pocket and eats
them quietly as she listens to the two voices

SIMON
Cant you get her into a girdle or
something

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0S)
Not with that dress sir We
might be able to use a pantyhose
with a control top Although Im
not sure if that will be
sufficient

SIMON
All right all right -- anything
Just try to do something And
were going to have to put her in
pants instead of shorts The tops
of her legs are very

Simon trails off searching for a polite term for the
tops of bad legs Suzanne stops chewing in suspense
Somehow she knows they are talking about her

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0S)
Bulbous She has cellulite

Suzanne winces Bulbous Cellulite

SIMON
1 do wish we could get her to stop
eating so much But then I
suppose having just given up
drugs she has to do something
Maybe we could get her to start
smoking 36

Suzanne stops eating It is her theyre talking about

Oh God

pocket

She slowly puts the cashews back in her

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0S)
What are we going to do about the
bed scene Mr Woodruff

SIMON
Cheat the angle somehow I
suppose Her breasts are rather
» out of shape arent they

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0S
If you have her on her back like
the script indicates her tits
will just move off into her
armpits

SIMON
How unpleasant Well perhaps you
should purchase some sort of
camisole or something I had no
idea when I hired her that she was
this out of shape Though I
suppose we couldnt have gotten
her if she was still in her
prime

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0S)
If youll forgive me Mr Woodruff
with her reputation she is lucky to
have a job at all She pretty much
destroyed the career she had This
18 a break for her

SIMON
I suppose youre right Its sad
isnt it really She was so good
in A Night Full Of Shoes Well
I hope all this isnt too much
trouble for your wardrobe
department Im almost sorry we
didnt get Valerie Rogers at this
point

WARDROBE MISTRESS Valerie has a terrific body

SIMON
Yes Well Alma I must get
back Thank you

)

74 36

Suzanne hears Simon START TO EXIT the truck and moves
away quickly

A tall thin MAN approaches her from the opposite
direction

GEORGE
(to Suzanne)
George Lazan Executive producer
of Kitchen Sink How are you

SUZANNE
Fine Suzanne ——

GEORGE
interrupts)
Vale I know Anyway have I
caught you at a bad time

George is silent for a moment then just suddenly
launches into the purpose of his visit He walks as he
talks Suzanne follows puppy-like

GEORGE

(continuing)
Well look I saw the rushes and
frankly youre holding back
See I think of this piece as a
light fluffy piece a kind of
“Whats Up Doc for cops So
you just gotta relax You gotta
just enjoy yourself and trust the
process

Suzanne is incredibly uncomfortable as she walks along
side George Lazan through the back lot of the studio

SUZANNE
(evenly)
Well I cant promise you Im
going to turn in a Barbra
Streisand performance

GEORGE
No no no You see I think of
Robert Munch as a kind of Ryan
ONeal type Hes a reactive
actor What we need is for you to
be the one who governs the pace of
the piece If you dictate the
pace then Bob will follow you 36

SUZANNE
I hardly think Im responsible for
the pace of the piece

GEORGE
(impatient)
Well look its a Happened One
Night kind of thing You know
what I mean Look do you think
you can do this part

SUZANNE
(tiny voice)
Yeah Why

GEORGE
I always ask my actors that
Look just because we imagined
Goldie Hawn or a Marilyn Monroe
kind of thing in this part now
weve got to deal with what you
have to bring to it We hired
you now we have to go with what
you have

SUZANNE

(sighs)
I appreciate your comments Mr
Lazan I11 certainly give
relaxing my best shot If Im not
enjoying myself though its not
because Im deliberately trying to
sabotage your film

GEORGE
I realize that Just do the best
you can Oh and by the way
dont worry about the nose

SUZANNE
(touches her nose)
The nose
GEORGE

Ive been talking to the cameraman
and we can straighten it with
lighting Youll barely see the
bump

SUZANNE
Great God bless you 36
We NOTICE a car and driver parked across the street
George sticks out his hand for shaking

GEORGE
Ill see you on the set

SUZANNE
Yes

George turns and climbs into the car waiting for him
The driver holds open the door Suzanne watches him
go

Suzanne walks back onto the set and approaches Simon

SIMON
Hello darling Whats the
problem

SUZANNE

(stern)
The problem Simon is that
hundreds of people have had
conversations with me concerning
my low enjoyment levels and my
nose and and it bothered
me I would prefer to receive
direction solely from you

Simon looks concerned and the wind almost blows off his
straw hat ‘

SIMON
(affronted)
Really Hundreds of people ‘That
shouldnt be I11 have to have a
word with them

SUZANNE
I mean were talking about one
day of work here A scene where I
was tied to a cactus and assaulted
by snakes all day As if I were a
child I mean why dont I give
them my mothers phone number
She can stand by and make sure Im
relaxed

Simon snaps his fingers 36

STMON
Thats it This is exactly her
This is the quality I want for
your character Right there
What youre doing now See

SUZANNE
But Simon this is not relaxed
This is incredibly upset If this
is the quality then maybe

Simon puts his arm around her and walks her toward the
platform where the crew waits

SUZANNE

interrupts
Darling just be yourself and
youll be fine I know it sounds
trite but trust me Ill talk to
the producers and make sure what
occurred yesterday is not
repeated Now try to calm down

Suzanne looks at Simon like one of them is insane

INT SUZANNES TINY TRAILER 37

Suzanne is once again removing her makeup at the end of
a long overwhelming day

She takes

a last look at her reflection and then exits

her dressing roomhamster cage

Suzanne is walking down a western street then turns a
corner into a suburban street reminiscent of “Leave It

ceal that

SUZANNE
I dont have a service I have a
machine
JACK

Im glad to see youre all right

SUZANNE
I suppose I should thank you

JACK
T could apologize to you for not
leaving my name when I dropped you
off at the hospital

SUZANNE
Under the circumstances it was
probably a secondary issue I
dont know whether theres a
polite way to behave during an
overdose with a complete stranger
or not

JACK
Well not a complete stranger
More a relative one And with
relatives like that --

SUZANNE

(interrupts)
Look I don’t know what happened
that night I can only guess --
No I dont even want to do that
-- but I want you to know that Im
not like that Im not exactly
sure what I am like but Im not
in the practice of going home
with -- 38

JACK
(interrupts)
What if I told you that nothing
happened

Suzanne stares at him

SUZANNE
Nothing what

JACK
Nothing happened We just talked
and then you took my Placidil and
fell fast asleep

SUZANNE
Why -- was I - am I so
unappealing to you

JACK
Quite the contrary But you were
a little the worse - or better -—-
for substances and I have rules
about that

SUZANNE
That sounds -- didnt Jimmy
Stewart say that to someone in a

movie
JACK
I£ he didnt he should have
SUZANNE
Are you sure I didnt sleep
with you
JACK
Sleep yes
SUZANNE
Kiss
JACK

What Here Now

SUZANNE
No Then That night

JACK
See if this rings a bell

Jack goes to kiss her Suzanne starts to resist but
her need for affection and his charm overwhelm her
They kiss gently shyly

He kisses 38

SUZANNE
It rings something but TI dont
know if its a memory bell or

JACK
interrupts
How about this

her again this time more passionately

SUZANNE
It certainly reminds me of
something I shouldve done before

JACK
It reminds me of something I want
to do later so I can look back on
it after that

SUZANNE
Im sort o£ nostalgic already

JACK

Nostalgic for the present

SUZANNE
Memories of now

JACK

Remember that time that I saw you

after seeing you before only you

didnt remember ‘til I kissed you

and you awoke into the dream that

was reality that we looked back on
without leaving the moment This

is then

SUZANNE
Are you Southern

JACK
Half Jewish why

SUZANNE
You talk so colorful Whats the
other half

JACK
Currently you

SUZANNE
Ah well then that explains it
I can see why I went home with you
that night unless youve had some
success recently and changed

( ) 38

JACK
I always say success doesnt
change people it just gives them
permission to become more fully
truly who they are Assholes
become gigantic assholes and good
people can become great Its a ’
form of magnification ‘

SUZANNE
So what about you

JACK
I havent had enough success yet
to go either way Im just a
lizard a lone lizard I have all
the pride of the B student You

SUZANNE
Me
(shrugs)
Im an asshole I guess

JACK
I doubt that

SUZANNE
I dont know maybe Im a lizard
too Certainly if you go by the
skin on my elbows I am

JACK
(sings)
You say asshole and I say
lizard

SUZANNE
(laughs)
Lets call the whole thing off
Well weve found our theme For
what its worth

JACK
For what its worth Dont you
know that people spend years
searching for their theme and
here weve achieved it in under an
hour Now well just have to find
our credo

SUZANNE
Our credo

JACK
And once weve determined that
well have to invent the secret
handshake and have the special
tour jackets made Oh we have
our work cut out for us Has
anybody ever told you that you
smell like Catalina Like a
hippy Like good sense

SUZANNE
As a matter of fact only this
morning

JACK

Really Has anybody ever told you
you smelled like the future

SUZANNE
But I break just like a little
girl
(sighs)
Oh look itll never work

JACK
Why

SUZANNE
We come from two totally different
backgrounds You were brought up
as a boy while I was brought up
as a girl

They smile at each other it might work

INT DORIS MANNS HOME - HALF AN HOUR LATER (4 AM 43

Suzanne opens the front door very quietly and shuts it
very quietly behind her She tiptoes gingerly down the
hall past the living room where Doris Mann sits in
the dark smoking

DORIS
(evenly)
Have you any idea what time it is
dear

Suzanne jumps startled

SUZANNE
Jesus Mother dont do that You
scared me

Doris turns on the light on the table next to her She
is in her robe There is a bottle of wine on the floor
next to her and she holds a glass The ashtray is
almost full and she smokes

DORIS
I suppose it never occurred to you
that you might have scared me by
staying out so late I was about
to call all the emergency rooms

SUZANNE
Im sorry Mother I didnt call
‘cause I thought you might be
asleep and I came home ‘cause I
didnt want to worry you

( )

porRIS

DORIS oa
What if you had taken drugs or
something Im supposed to be
taking care of you now Youre my
responsibility Youre my
daughter What was I supposed to
think when you didnt come home

Doris starts pouring herself another glass of wine

She looks

up to see Suzanne watching her

DORIS
(continuing)
Do you mind if I have a drink

SUZANNE
Do you mind if I drop acid

DORTS
Dear I drink socially

SUZANNE
I took acid socially

DORIS
I hardly think my drinking can be
compared with your drug taking
dear And even if it could be I
think your involvement with drugs
has vindicated me I hardly think
youre in a position to judge me

SUZANNE
Mom

pORIS
I hope you werent out sleeping
with someone

SUZANNE
No I wasnt out sleeping with
someone Mother

DORIS
Well if you were I hope you used

SUZANNE
Mother Im middie aged

DORIS
(interrupts)
Im middle aged and you just got
out of a drug clinic so obviously
you dont know whats best for

you

SUZANNE
Oh and I suppose you do

DORIS
I think I do yes

SUZANNE
Thats the drunk calling the
kettle stoned

DORIS
How did we become so estranged
Suzanne I have always tried to
be a good mother to you only to
be met with this fresh superior
attitude of yours You have felt
my intellectual superior since you
were fourteen years old —- and
rightly so you were always more
verbal than I Me Whatever
But why have you turned away from
me I just want you to like me
I just want to be your friend

SUZANNE
I didnt need a friend I needed
mother

DORIS

Well you can accuse me of many
things but not of not being your
mother What is the thing that
annoys you about me Isnt it
that I mother you You know
dear its very hard to have a
conversation with you Do you
hear how youre talking to me
Like Im a moron

SUZANNE
Thats how I think you talk to me
Could we have this conversation
tomorrow Im tired 43

DORIS
Every time I try to get close to
you you push me away How would
you like to have Joan Crawford for
a mother Or Lana Turner I
think you had it pretty good

SUZANNE
Oh please these are the options
You or Lana or Joan

DORIS
Youl1 never £orgive me for
falling under the pressures of
life For not living up to the
standards I set for myself For
being the person I am in your
looking-glass for not remaining
that person so I broke under
the money pressure If it wasnt
for you I wouldve killed myself

SUZANNE
There see its like that that
you say I dont know what to do
with that

DORIS
Just know how much I Love you
Oh I know maybe you needed a
different mother one that baked
cookies I dont knit I dont
embroider but I have always tried
to give you the best and you throw
it away I came from nothing and
made something out of my life
You came from somewhere and are
trying to make nothing out of
yours Youre going to have to
get over what happened to you in
your adolescence dear Its time
to move on

Suzanne looks at her mother for an odd beat There is

throw away You could be as big a
star as that that Madonna girl
She hasnt got half your voice I
keep telling you if you would
only make an album I couid
produce it We could make one of
those videos

Suzanne has heard this speech before and it drives her
crazy She might mouth some of the words as her mother
recites them

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
Im not going to be a singer
Mom Im getting out of the
business If I dont Ill never
have any kind of chance at having
a normal life

DORIS
Now lets take this one thing at a
time

(MORE)

( ) 54

DORIS (CONTD)
First everyone is always getting
out of the business and B youre
just like me Some days I wake up
and feel like Im talking to my
armpit

SUZANNE
Could you please stop telling me
how to Live my life for at least a
couple of minutes Isnt it
enough that you were right Now
you have to deprive me of some
precious stolen moments of self
pity for having lost my money

DORIS
Stolen moments Youve been
feeling sorry for yourself half
the time for having a monster of a
mother like me Everything about
you says look what youve done to
me --

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
Mother I never said you were a
monster

DORIS
No you dont say it youre even
too smart to think it But you
feel it You somehow lay the
entire blame of your drug taking
on me

SUZANNE
I do not Mother I took the
drugs nobody made me

DORIS
Oh sure thats your logical
brain telling you that but in
your heart you feel that Im an
alcoholic and thats whats to
blame for your weakness isnt
it

Suzanne is silent

DORIS
Go ahead say it -- you think Im
an alcoholic

SUZANNE
Mother Okay Poof I think
youre an alcoholic Happy now

DORIS
Well maybe I was an alcoholic --

when you were a teenager I had a

nervous breakdown when my marriage
failed and I lost all that money
But I got over it Now I just
drink like an Irish person--

SUZANNE
interrupts )
I know I know like an Irish

person -- you just enjoy your wine
-- you drink to relax -- youve
told me

DORTS

Dont be fresh

SUZANNE
Is there a cut off age for fresh
or does it just go on indefinitely
as long as you have older
relatives You dont want me to
be a singer Mother youre the
singer youre the performer Tf
cant compete with you What if
somebody won Oh you want me to
do well - just not better than
you

DORIS
Maybe youre just jealous cause I
can drink and you cant take drugs
anymore I can handle it and you
cant

SUZANNE
Handle iti How the hell do you
handle it

DORIS
(interrupts)
My drinking doesn’t interfere with
my work like it did with you My
drinking doesnt interfere with my
life

SUZANNE
What do you call this7

( )

lll 54

DORIS
I call this Youre sitting in
judgement over me What I do is
my business What I drink is my
business

SUZANNE
And what I do is mine I£ you
want me to get off your back then
get off mine

DORIS
Im your mother

SUZANNE
And Im your daughter And Im
long past the age where it’s
appropriate for you to tell me
what to do Look at this A
woman my age struggling to grow
up to break Eree of her mother
This is tragic

DORIS
I wish my mother had been as
concerned about me when I was a
girl

SUZANNE
Your mother beat you and locked
you in closets

DORIS
One closet And she didnt beat
me she used a strap on me
sometimes when I talked back to
her Youre lucky you had me as a
mother and not her - if you think
Im tough

SUZANNE
Oh youll do

DORIS
And just what is that supposed to
mean

SUZANNE
Nothing

DORIS
No tell me this awful thing that
I did to you when you were a
child I want to know

(

i12 54

SUZANNE
You want to know Pine You gave
me sleeping pills when I was nine
years old

DORIS
I gave you sleep eze Over the
counter medication and I gave it
to you cause you couldnt sleep

SUZANNE
You dont give children sleeping
pills when they cant sleep

DORIS
Theyre not sleeping pills
theyre store bought -—- perfectly
safe Its not fair to blame me
for your drugs I dont blame my
mother for my misfortunes -- for
my drinking

SUZANNE
You dont acknowledge you drink
how could you blame your mother
for something you dont do You
know why I took drugs Because I
never wanted to end up drinking
like you

DORIS

- Dear Im sorry if you think I

Suzannes

hurt you Everything I did I did
out of love for you I may have
done wrong sometimes How can you
do everything right That time
with the dress -- Im ashamed of
that But what can I do So f
made some mistakes Im human
Youve never forgiven me for not
being the perfect mother you
thought you had before you were a
teenager -- before my breakdown

eyes fill This is true
SUZANNE
Please stop
DORIS

I€ I did wrong giving you those
pills Im sorry How was I to
know We didnt have self-help
books then like they do now The
only place I had to learn from was
my own childhood

7) 54
Suzanne starts out of the house

DORIS
(continuing)
Where are you going Suzanne

you

SUZANNE
Im going to make an album okay

tumors removed okay Im going
to have a hysterectomy so that we
can break this chain of
destructive dominating women

now
Suzanne gets into her car and drives away 55
INT LOOPING STAGE HALF AN HOUR LATER 56

Lowell sits behind a table with two other men the
editor and the sound editor The room is in semi-
darkness There is a music stand with some script
pages on it under a microphone Also on the music
stand are some headphones

Suzanne enters slightly bedraggled and harassed

SUZANNE
Im sorry Im sorry
LOWELL
Whatre you sorry for
SUZANNE
Arent I late I thought I was
late
LOWELL

No as a matter of fact youre
early We weren’t expecting you
for another half an hour

SUZANNE
Oh but go is it okay now

Lowell looks at her strangely Almost with compassion

LOWELL
Yes its okay now

Lowell pushes an intercom button

)

i14

LOWELL

(continuing)
Victor Miss Vale is here could
we put up her reels now please

(back to Suzanne)
There now wasnt that simple
Suzanne this is our editor Phil
Hartley and our sound editor
Elliot Morse

Suzanne and Phil and Elliot shake hands and exchange

greetings

Suzanne continues to look uncomfortable as the scene
progresses As though she had sand in her soul

VICTOR (0S)
Ready Lowell

LOWELL
Thank you Victor
(to Suzanne)

Well shall we begin

SUZANNE
Okay

Suzanne stands in front of the little music stand

LOWELL
Youre really much better in the
film than you deserve to be

Suzanne looks distressed and nods

SUZANNE
Good I mean thank you Im
sorry that I was such a nightmare

LOWELL
Well you seem -- better now

SUZANNE
Really No I dont

LOWELL
Better because youre sober and --

SUZANNE
interrupts)
Worse because Im sober

LOWELL
Yes But worse in a good way 56

The movie comes up on the screen that we saw filmed at
the beginning of the movie only in black and white
Suzanne is being slapped by the prison guard She
flies across the room turns her head slowly and says
her speech We see Suzanne see herself with a mixture
of fascination and horror Her eyes squint and she
takes a step backward as though to protect herself from
herself This version of herself She is good in the
scene until she fucks up the line

SUZANNE (V0)

on screen)
-»» We will survive any
humiliation We have more spirit
and more resources than you Ail
itll cost us is money while
you there isnt enough mommy in
the world to further a cause like
yours

SUZANNE
Shit

LOWELL
Thats as good as it got all day
We didnt get one full take after
that You only got progressively
worse

SUZANNE
I know Im sorry

LOWELL
Dont be sorry fix it

SUZANNE
What

Lowell motions for Suzanne to put on the headphones

SUZANNE
continuing)
Oh

Suzanne puts on the headphones and they run the film
back Suzanne watches herself backwards The film
starts forward again We hear the three beeps before
the words there isnt enough mommy in the world and
after which Suzanne says it correctly

SUZANNE
(continuing)
There isnt enough money in the
world

( ) 56

ELLIOT
Perfect

LOWELL
Lets look at it

The film is run again This time with the sound cor
rection It is “perfect” Normal It has ‘an odd
effect on Suzanne Her eyes fill with tears She
controls herself and looks down

LOWELL
(continuing)
Lucky for you we can cut away to
the guard

Lowell looks over and notices that Suzanne is more than
somewhat upset He very quietly sends the two editors
away clearing the room Lowell moves to Suzanne

LOWELL
(continuing)

What could possibly be the matter
Here youve gone back and
corrected the past -- at least in
your work What could be a better
metaphor It couldnt be
something I said

SUZANNE
(crying)
Nothing you to say to me is as
horrible as what I say to myself
and at least its happening
outside my head where I can deal
with it easier

LOWELL
So what is it Do you want me to
abuse you more

SUZANNE
Help me I cant do it Any of
it I don’t know how and I cant
ask

LOWELL
What are you doing now

SUZANNE
Dont you get it I just know how
to talk I give self-awareness 4
bad name Youve got to find me
in back of what Im saying

56 56

LOWELL
The trouble with you is youve had
it easy and you dont even know
it

SUZANNE
No I do know it Thats the
trouble I torture myself over
it

LOWELL
Youre not going to get too much
sympathy from anyone Do you know
how many people would give their
right arm to be in show business
To lead the kind of life you lead

SUZANNE
The trouble is I cant feel my
life I can see it all around me
and I see that so much of it is
good and I just take it the
wrong way Its like this thing
with my mom - I know she does all
this stuff cause she cares about
me but I can’t seem to believe
it And other stuff

Lowell hands Suzanne a Kleenex and she blows her nose
hard

LOWELL
I dont really know whats
happening with your mother but
Maybe she will stop mothering you
when you grow up

SUZANNE
You dont know my mother

LOWELL
No but I know you You could
make a mother out of anybody
Look your mother did it to you
and her mother did it to her and
back and back and back all the way
to Eve and at some point you have
to just stop it and say Fuck it
I start with me

SUZANNE
Did you just make that up 56

LOWELL
I was working on it when you came
in I£ youd come a half an hour
later when you were supposed to IT
could have made it better

SUZANNE
It sounds pretty good as it is

LOWELL
You just like it ‘cause it sounds
a little like movie dialogue

SUZANNE
Yeah thats me I dont want life
to imitate art I want life to be
art

LOWELL
Look look up on the screen See
what you can do And you werent
even conscious then Imagine what
you could do now

SUZANNE
Maybe I should just go back into
the clinic

LOWELL
Speaking of art Look growing up
is a process not an event Its
not like in the movies where you
have a realization and your life
changes In life you have a
realization and your life changes
a month or so later

Lowell and Suzanne look at each other

They look

SUZANNE
So I just have to wait a month

LOWELL
Of course it all depends on the
realization Some of them you
enly have to wait a couple weeks
maybe

at each other How did this happen

LOWELL
(continuing)
Its better out here coping than
in the clinic giving up - ‘cause
youll end up out here coping
eventually anyway
(MORE) 56

LOWELL (CONTD)
So why not start now Anyway you
cant go back into the hospital I
have a job For you

SUZANNE
A job You wouldnt be ashamed to-
work with me again

LOWELL
Well it doesnt start for a
couple of months so you have
Plenty of time to have your
realization grow up and leave
your mother Although I must
admit I was a little taken aback
when you did a second rate cop
film after you worked with me

SUZANNE
How do you know about that

LOWELL
I know everything Except

He looks at her

SUZANNE
What

He smiles

LOWELL
You know

Suzanne smiles and nods slowly
INT SUZANNES CAR DRIVING HOME 57

Suzanne is feeling much better as she drives back to
Doris The fever is broken She is hopeful
inspired Possibly the song Dont Worry Be Happy is
on the radio as she drives down Doris street At the
end of the block where Doris house is Suzanne
notices lights What is that Police cars No Oh

chart in his hand

ADMITTING NURSE

Suzanne does not recognize him as the Doctor from her
overdose

SUZANNE
Can I see her

INT DORIS MANNS HOSPITAL ROOM

Suzanne enters Doris looks tiny and frightened
sitting in her bed There is a bandage on her head
We are seeing her without her wig and makeup for the
first time She looks startled and vulnerable as
Suzanne enters -- her eyes fill with tears When she
talks she sounds very childlike and unaffected

Pearl sits on the bed near her looking victorious and
smug Sid sits watching TV Owen sits playing
solitaire or reading a Louis LAmour novel t is a
tableau of vivid women and shadow men

PEARL
There she is My other monster
I cant seem to keep you two out
of the hospital lately

SUZANNE
to Doris

PEARL

respect --

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
Im simply suggesting we try to
enjoy each other without trying to
assign blame

PEARL
(to Doris)
Woooo Listen to Miss Snooty
Britches Assign blame

Doris gives Suzanne a helpless look Suzanne starts to
usher Pearl out of the room

PEARL
(continuing)
And just what do you think youre
doing young lady

SUZANNE
Moving you out of here and into
the waiting room
Suzanne physically ushers Pearl out of the room

( 60
PEARL

Pearl is gone cs

OWEN
Yap Yap Yape Yap YaPr Yap yap

Qwen continues reading and perhaps smoking Sid
continues watching TV perhaps noting briefly that
Pearl has exited

DORIS
I£ I thought I made you feel like
that Id kill myself

SUZANNE
Dont even say that in jest Ma
Particularly while you are in a
hospital People might take it
the wrong way

Doris recognizes what Suzanne said as something she
said to her earlier Both women smile at each other

DORIS
I suppose she means well

SUZANNE
She sounds like that voice in your
head that tells you you cant do
anything

DORIS
Yes Thats true isnt it
Where did you go to

SUZANNE
Looping I shouldnt have gone
that way Im sorry

DORIS
You dont really think that I
dont want you to do well do you

Suzanne sits on the bed and looks at her mother

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Some Its not ali rubbed off

DORIS

and they never grew back

Suzanne goes through her purse

SUZANNE

Mama
DORIS

Its your turn now and its tough
for me to face that mine is almost
up Its so important to enjoy
your turn dear And it would
help me so much to know that
one of us enjoyed her youth

Suzanne applies base on her mothers face avoiding
her little bandage

DORIS
(continuing)
Do you have a mirror
Suzanne hands her a mirror 60

DORIS

(continuing)
Oh my lord look at me Tsch
tsch tsch You know I dont
mind getting older -- I never
thought Id live this long - but
what I do mind is looking older -
Do you have an eyebrow pencil

Suzanne hands her mother an eyebrow pencil

DORIS
(continuing)
Its in my will that they dont
bury me without eyebrows I dont
go in the ground without them

Doris draws on her eyebrows Suzanne brushes Doris
hair back in a knot Doris pulls at the flesh under
her chin

DORIS

(continuing)
Maybe I should have that
lyposuction under here

SUZANNE
Theres press out there Mama

Doris looks dismayed

DORIS
I figured The Enquirer I bet
The Star

SUZANNE
Doris Mann in drunken brawl with
tree

DORIS

Doris Mann still distraught over
divorce from Tony Vale twenty-five
years ago attempts suicide with
lethal oak

Both are laughing Doris applies lipstick She is
beginning to look like her old young self Suzanne
ties a scarf around her head -- turban-like concealing
the bandage

SUZANNE
We should get a family rate at
this emergency room 60

DORIS
At least

Doris turns and faces Suzanne She looks like Doris
again

DORIS -
(continuing)
How do I look

SUZANNE
Great Ma

mother her shoes dear

Suzanne gets her mothers shoes

DORIS
(continuing)
Okay baby lets go get ‘em

Suzanne opens the door Doris walks toward her
finishing her hair

DORIS

(continuing)
You know what my mother said to me

airs that I use big words like
devastate and gesture I dont
think those are so awfully big do
you

SUZANNE
No Mama

DORIS
What am I supposed to do Sound
like a hick all my life just to
make her happy

Doris walks to the door Owen sings
OWEN
(sings)
And the farmer hauled another load
away

DORTS

Oh well compared to the end of

the world

crisis to bring us together

lately

Like war buddies a

A beat

JESSE

Suzanne looks at him blankly

SUZANNE

Youre not

JESSE

(nodding)
I pumped your stomach

CONTINOED 63

Suzanne in character comes out stands before the
microphone and the band begins to play She introduces
her song and starts to sing The audience ignores

her The mirrored ball sparkles through the smoke
filled air Waitresses serve drinks

As she continues singing the audience gradually falls
silent and listens to Suzanne in character sing

They are enthralled 9
The CAMERA CRANES UP and we see the crew on various
perches MOVING CAMERA CONTINUES UP and FINDS high on
4 catwalk Doris watching She smiles

END CREDITS OVER

Audience stomping screaming and whistling
