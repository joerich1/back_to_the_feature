UNDERWATER - NIGHT 2

An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the
water An autonomous fifteen-man submersible Almost
futuristic in its design The nose cone is an amazing ultra
high-pressure plexi-dome LETTERING along the side tells us
this is the SHINKAI 90000

FOR THE DEEPEST DIVE

SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 3

The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and
barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW The Sailors
work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers The
JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic
position board a contiuously-shifting graphic representation
of the ocean contours below Behind them is an elaborate
DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics READ 34000 feet and
dropping The Crew works at a fevered pitch An ALARM SOUNDS
as the depth gauge sounds 35000 feet All eyes on the depth
gauge Several Science Officers share excited looks

ON THE DEPTH GAUGE 35100 -- 35200 -- 35300 -- 354004

The excitement builds Even the Captains weathered eyes
widen And then as the depth gauge hits 35801 feet below
sea level the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS WHOOPS
HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES

CUT TO
SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 5

As it continues its descent it passes corroding metal drums
leaking toxic waste radioactive waste dumped in the depths
away from prying eyes and populated areas The vessel drops
into the SULU BASIN Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty
thousand feet of water

But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon
Down here ten thousand fathoms below the storm all is calm

The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON
The Bathysaphe is now mobile It glides down the side of an
enormous rock face carefully avoiding massive sandstone
pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below

DISSOLVE TO
DEEP SEA - NIGHT 6

THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate A ROBOTIC
ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome Its hand is a
high-tech LASER CUTTER It approaches the plate steadies
then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock burns the rock
into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern

Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward its CLAW rips out the
cut rock from inside the pattern then takes the sample and
sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersibles port side

DISSOLVE TO
MINDINAO DEEP - NIGHT 7

A desolate barren spooky place Nothing breathes Nothing
lives Or so it would appear The creepy foreboding MUSICAL
SCORE tells us otherwise The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK
FISSURE

CUT TO
SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 8

The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi
dome and out into the freezing cobalt blue of the PALAWAN
TROUGH The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve Then
dead ahead is the end of the trough which is half-blocked
by a rock-encrusted embankment

The MUSIC builds

The Shinkai approaches the embankment Slowly starts to glide
up the side The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized
by all the lonely creepiness They crest the embankment And
the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror

As far as the eye can see the entire murky landscape is
filled with WHALE BONES A valley of death Cluttered here
and there carelessly flung about are the rusting hulks of
several ships Seemingly ripped apart Clusters of shark
cartilage float through the water like white ghosts

The Captain the Science Officers and the entire Crew just
stare frozen in place by the strange horror before them

CUT TO
SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 9
The vessel cruises through the valley of death Everyone is
nervously taking readings making calculations and adjusting
equipment

Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking

Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi
dome Giant skeletons everywhere

CUT TO
SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 10
The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation The
robotic arm comes out The laser cutter steadies aims then

shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock

WHOOSH A HUGE JET STREAM OF INKY BLOOD BLASTS OUT OF THE
FORMATION

CUT TO
SHNKAI 9000 - NIGHT 11

The Captain and the Science Officers recoil as the inky stuff
envelopes the plexi-dome completely blotting out the VIEW

CUT TO
PALAWAN TROUGH - NIGHT 12

The Shinkai VANISHES into a huge cloud of inky blood We HOLD
for a LONG OMINOUS BEAT And then like a slow-motion
earthquake large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift
in the murky waters WHALE BONES TOPPLE and SCATTER Several
feet under the ancient silt something is coming alive

CUT TO
SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 13
Everything outside the plexi-dome is still BLACK Everyone is

staring at the position board which shows a large section of
the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE its contours incongruous

with the rest of the graphic representation

The Science Officers look stunned The Captain barks
commands The Crew leaps into high gear

Then the Captain reverses the trottle and petal-to-the-metal
he starts to back out

The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome Then suddenly and
impossibly the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT Everybody goes
ass-over-teacups EQUIPMENT SHATTERS SPARKS FLY GLASS
BREAKS Lots of YELLING in Japanese

The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE Something has a hold on
it More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS Men are thrown about Then it
stops rocking The Sailors stop yelling Everything goes dead
quiet Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks A SOUND is
HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship like feet runing
across the outside of the hull Very creepy

The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE
And then the sub begins to be crushed like its a beer can
The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides RIVETS POP and SNAP
WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS More SPARKS FLY The STEEL PLATING
DIMPLES CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony CHAOS PANDEMONIUM
And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES A massive CHURNING SWIRL of
water metal and men

PILOT HOUSE - SUNSET 15

Stripped down low frills high tech where JOHN T
FINNEGAN bathed in the last light of day all taut muscle
and sinew all business with every one of his 38 years
etched on his rugged good looking face is harnessed into
the steering pylon wrestling with his steering-sticks
holding the bouncing jetfoil steady as he can hauling ass
propelled it seems by the music blasting out of four state
of the art speakers bolted to the metal walls Light from the
laser imagers plays across Finnegans face The face of a man
in his element on the edge in control He barks commands
into his RADIO HEADSET

FINNEGAN
How we doing out there

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see LEILA a muscular Filipina
clambering over the foredeck Shes dripping wet Tough as
nails She turns to Finnegan and mouths something into her
headset Finnegan flashes her his most charming smile

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Yes Im very warm and dry in here
thank you for your concern

His HEADSET comes alive withe the SOUND of LEILA bitching in
an unintelligible foreign tongue

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
A raise I already pay you two
bucks a day

He watches as Leila fights the WIND and SEASPRAY and dogs
tight a series of hatch-latches across the foredec

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Missed one darling

Leila turns and gives him a jerking-off sign with her hand

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
I love you too

The Radar Imager suddenly blinks and goes to black Dead
Finnegan taps on the screen Nothing Taps on the console
Still nothing Simultaneously two more imagers shut down His
mouth screws tight

Crammed wall to wall with enough horsepower to fly a 747
Pumped out of two thumping engines The domain of a scruffy
shifty-eyed likeable little weasel of a mechanical
geniusJOEY PANTUCCI

Wearing a mechanics toolbelt slung sideways across the hips
like a gunslinger singing the theme to Gilligans Island
over the engines roar Way off-key His hands crammed deep
in a tangle of wires On the walls are a few pictures Of a
few major league engines Of a few major league pinups and a
few of Pantucci and Finnegantogether in the US Navyin
front of the Saipan in shinier days

PANTUCCI

fearless crew --

He tugs at the wires

PANTUCCI (CONTD)

Pantucci works his wrench around an engine mount And his
nervous eyes around six men big bad men standing on the
far side of the engines out in a narrow passage

A Maori(VIVO) Two Aussies (MASON and MULLIGAN) A

Samoan (MAMOOLI) A Chinese(CHIN) And an Aborigine (BILLY)
Tattooed armed to the teeth packed in Kevlar body armor
Mercenaries Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your
hand And a sixth man HANOVER The obvious leader

Smoother than the rest but still showing the edge of a man
risen from their ranks He consults his watch with a growing
concern

PANTUCCI

shit as we ever carried

Pantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch
again and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named
MASON to follow him up a ladder

PANTUCCI (CONTD)
and some of its coming your
way

He quickly pulls out a wrench slaps it over a bolt and
tightens it down The leak stops He blows on the WRENCH like
its a six-shooter then spins it at the speed of light and
holsters it into his toolbelt

As Finnegan is watching the sea ahead swathed in
shrieking Clapton guitar solos the hatch opens

Hanover enters followed by Mason who leaves the

slams over the waves

keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea

HANOVER

Finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map

FINNEGAN
Right heremiddle of nowhere

HANOVER
And where is our point of arrival

Finnegan points to another spot on the map

FINNEGAN
Right heremiddle of

HANOVER
Which question is that

FINNEGAN
The one you came up to askare we

FINNEGAN

MASON
They werebut they musta been
talking about another Finnegan
because the one I heard about was
as rough as they camethe one Im

current as the music

HANOVER
Dont mind him Finneganyou

splashing around in a sea of
testosterone

FINNEGAN
I dont mind himbut I do think
its time for him to get back down
below with the rest of the
playgroup

MASON
And whos gonna make me

Finnegan looks at Masonat the open hatchway just behind
him

FINNEGAN
The Finnegan you heard about

and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead The force
of acceleration tumbles Hanover into the console Mason
tumbles out the open hatchway down the stairs behind him As
he rises Hanover regards Finnegan for a moment A smile

flits across his face

HANOVER
Thats why were sill around
Finneganyou and me Nothing

gets the feathers up Business is
business Eh

Finnegans hand finds the console He hits a button The
first strains of Led Zepplins WHOLE LOTTA LOVE comes roaring
out of the speakers

FINNEGAN

Finnegan cranks the sound to the max pulls back on both
steer sticks and holds on as the force of acceleration
hammers him into the pylon

impeccably delicate frail her beauty long faded except
from her eyes Kindness becomes her like moonlight does the
night

OLD WOMAN (CONTD)
He said that it was the orchid I
wore that made him fall in love

The Old Woman looks at the orchid And then at Trillian

OLD WOMAN (CONTD)
But without him here I dont know
why I should

Trillian takes the orchid from her hair and places it in the
lapel of the womans jacket

TRILLIAN
Because an orchid and a beautiful
woman belong together

The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving
sincere The moment between them is broken by the keen clear
sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute

Mason enraged swings with his free hand Finnegan twists
his arm sharply sending Masons head into the steel wall

Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanovers face an inch from
his eye

Finnegan cocks the spear CLICK Hanover does not blink
Everyone freezes With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci

another page

A LONG SCARY BEAT

And then suddenly -- She SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY and gives a sharp
CRY Her eyes filled panic She tries to stand but shes
JERKED BACK DOWN Her ARMS FLAIL WILDLY

Scattering stuff off the counter She tries to SCREAM but it
comes out more like a GURGLE Below her in the TOILET there
is a hideous SLURPING SOUND She manages a final desperate
scream a high-pitched WAIL

Which nobody hears because

eyes follow the sound across the ceiling Her hand goes to
her hair She pulls her lock pick out and very slowly kneels
down until she is eye level with the door lock She begins to
pick her way out her ears and eyes following the gurgling
above Suddenly the sound stops The silence makes Trillians
heart sound that much louder She sidles close to the wall

Over in the far corner Vivo is watching Pantucci working over
a metal lathe repairing the cylinder head Metal-on-metal

hold a dozen people Trillian rushes in and hits the up
button She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors
closeuntil the elevator starts going down

TRILLIAN
Up I want to go up

She panics And starts pushing the up button frantically her
heart pounding in her chest

There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator
descendinguntil something drops on the roof with a THUMP
Trillian screams The elevator comes to a bumps stop

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
NoNo

Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevatorand then
the car starts to move again

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Go upplease go up

Trillian pounds on ever button on the console to no avail
The car continues its inexorable descent Finally in
desperation she hits the emergency stop button The elevator
stops The emergency SIREN WHINES A LONG BEAT Nothing
movesand then

WHAM Something beats on the roof trying to break in And
again -- WHAM The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its
descent Trillian backs up against the wall staring at the
ceiling scared The ELEVATOR DINGS

Startled TRILLIAN SCREAMS The DOORS start to OPEN
Panicked Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposala
high heel The DOORS OPEN -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN Trillian
swings her high heelright into Pantuccis face
Finnegan plows in right behind him

Trillian tries to run out

Trillian struggles

PANTUCCI
OWWW OOWWW

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN

FINNEGAN (CONTD)

Finnegan grabs her

Finnegan does not let go of her

Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegans
hand breaking his grip

Just then
to ascend

FINNEGAN (CONTD)

and the car starts
Trillian hears music to her ears

TRILLIAN
You have a boat

Her demeanor changes her voice goes to honey

PANTUCCI
Finnegan

Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at
the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the
ceiling All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the
ceilingfollowed by a sucking sound

TRILLIAN
Its up there

Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling The
sucking sound stops

FINNEGAN
Not anymore

The elevator stops DING The door opens Finnegan whirls his
rifle rising Trillian lifts her high heel ready to
strike

Hanover Chin and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on
the car The Captain and Canton quiver behind them There is
a momentary stand off

HANOVER
Where are my men

FINNEGAN
Dead

CHIN
YAAHHH

Chin charges Finnegan the butt of his rifle raised to smash
Finnegans skull Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the
rear wall of the elevator Mamooli jumps Finnegan from
behind wrapping his rifle against Finnegans throat
Pantucci jumps on Mamoolis massive back ripping at his
face Finnegan drops buries his elbow in Mamoolis solar
plexus spins and has his knife out of his boot and at
Mamoolis throat in a flash

ANGLE ON Trillian Impressed She had no idea

HANOVER
Drop it

Finnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanovers gunand a
pair of eyes that will use it Finnegan does as he is told

HANOVER (CONTD)
Now back up

Again Finnegan does as he is told

HANOVER (CONTD)
Everybody in

The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply As they
slip in Trillian tries to slip out Hanover swings his gun
on her

HANOVER (CONTD)

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN

FINNEGAN

HANOVER
With who

All of a sudden the car is jerked to a halt as if some

giant hand was yanking on the cable

FINNEGAN
With that

And then the elevator jerks down again And up Everyone is
thrown about like straw Everyone is shouting panicked

And then the jerking stopsand the sound of sucking
surrounds the car The cable starts twisting creaking
sickeningly above their heads

PANTUCCI
Its gonna snap the cable

Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically

TRILLIAN
Open Open God damn it

Finnegan is at the doors pulling them with all his might

FINNEGAN
Help me

Pantucci then Mamooli then Hanover and Chin pull at the
doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons The doors part a
bit

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Theyre coming Theyre coming

The doors fly open toa solid wall

FINNEGAN (CONTD)

Oh shit

And silenceuntil the doors slam shutthe cable
snapsand the car plummets Screaming and shouting mixes
with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame
against the shaft Finnegans eyes go to the floor indicator

12 -- 11 -- 10 -- 9 -- 8 -- 7 -- 6 -- 5 -- 4 13
An AUTOMATED VOICE rapidly CALLS OUT right along with it --

VOICE
4th floor 3rd floor 2nd floor
lst floor

Down down down it goes Faster and faster But the elevator
doesnt stop at the first floor It keeps dropping The FLOOR
INDICATOR BLINKS SUBLEVEL SUBLEVEL SUBLEVEL

CANTON
Its taking us to the bottom of the
ship

FINNEGAN
HANG ON

CABLES SNAP METAL SCREAMS The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE
Which is actually good because its getting jammed sideways
in the shaft which slows it down The it HITS bottom with a
resounding crash

CUT TO
SUBLEVEL LOBBY - DAY 85

The DOORS BLOW OUT into the darkened hallway For a long
moment nothing moves then Finnegan tumbles out of the
elevator Rising painfully One after another the others exit
into the dark lobby

HANOVER
Where are we

CANTON
The sublevel lobby

Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles

HANOVER
Dont touch it

Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily his own
rifle trained on Finnegan

FINNEGAN
You shoot me and you got no ride
home

And with that Finnegan picks up the gun A test of wills
Finnegan wins and then turns to the Captain

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
You the Captain

CAPTAIN
Yes

FINNEGAN
How do we get out of here

CAPTAIN
We have to make it to the third
deck

Pantucci steps on something CRUNCH He looks down his eyes
widen

PANTUCCI
Oh no Oh no Finnegan

He starts dancing around trying not to step on whatever it
is Trillian looks down and SCREAMS

Everybody freaks --

Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chins utility belt and
sweeps the beam over the lobby The entire floor of the lobby
is littered with shattered HUMAN SKELETONS Picked clean and
spit out Just like the earlier whale bones

Then suddenly at the far end of the hallway one of the
metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES Everybody feezes
And then the FLEXING suddenly comes RACING down either side
of the hallway accompanied by the most god-awful PRIMORDIAL
SCREECH

FINNEGAN
This way

FINNEGAN BOLTS Everybody else right behind him The FLEXING
and SCREECHING VANISHES into the walls

CUT TO
FUJI MARY and SAIPAN - DAY 86

RAIN POURS DOWN on the Fuji Maru and the Saipan as they bob
in the waves surrounded by endless choppy ocean waters

CUT TO
SAIPAN ENGINE ROOM - DAY 87
Billy comes down the steps gun out front looking around

BILLY
Hey you Muscles Out here

There is no reply The only sound is the sucking of the pump

BILLY (CONTD)
OK You want it that way

He ENTERS the waist-high water

BILLY (CONTD)

Billy heads deeper into the hold

CUT TO
MACHINE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 88
Damp dark and disgusting A MAZE of pipes and gears lines

Everyones gathering themselves around the room Trillian
Pantucci

Hanover Mamooli Chin the Captain and Canton

TRILLIAN

CAPTAIN

FINNEGAN
Why dont you want a message sent

CANTON
I just think that

FINNEGAN
Because you know a message cant be
sent

There is a moment of silence

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Youre the inside guy arent you
The guy who knocked out the
communications
Hanover sets Masons pulse-rifle down and claps his hands

HANOVER
Bravo

Canton flashes Hanover a look The Captain is confused
Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON spins him around and SLAMS
him against the hull

TRILLIAN
How the hell do we fix it

A tense moment as Canton debates his situation then relents

CANTON
You cant All the systems were
melted at their core by nitric
acid

CAPTAIN

(confused)

This was your lifes workyour
dreams

CANTON

My dreams cost more than they would
makeI miscalculated the

market there was no way I could
recoup

FINNEGAN
Unless you collected on the
insurance

TRILLIAN

What are you people talking about

FINNEGAN
Hes with them

He motions to the mercenaries

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
They rob the joint blind and
torpedo it to the bottom He
collects the insurance and sails
off into the sunset clean as a
whistle

Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Right

The Captain blows He leaps on Canton His hands find the
older mans throat

CAPTAIN
All these people dead Because you
screwed up on the math

Finnegan pulls the Captain off

FINNEGAN
Its not going to help us

CAPTAIN
Were going to die here Were
going to die

Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands calming him

FINNEGAN
I was born in a City housing
project in the Bronx OK Its not
in the cards that I die on a luxury
cruise shipnow which way up

TRILLIAN
(alarmed)
You hear that

Unseen by anyone there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY The
walls start to come alive with dark SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS
HIDDEN within the maze of machinery OBSCURED by the bad
lighting glistening abominations slither over pipes squirm
through gears and undulate in and out of crevices and holes
The room is becoming a living throbbing pulsating horror

CAPTAIN
They arethey are everywhere

FINNEGAN
All right be cool everybody nice
and slow no sudden moves

Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch Then a
loud GURGLING is HEARD Everybody looks up at the ceiling

Hidden within the girders and sticking to them a large
translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling Inside
it are strange disgusting biological workings The GURGLING
suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER And then we SEE BILLY and
LEILA being sucked down the entire length of the fatty
intestine Still alive And squirming wildly EVERYBODY
freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch Finnegan and Hanover
OPEN FIRE Covering their asses

CUT TO
ENGINE CHAMBERS - NIGHT 89

Everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into

this mechanical MAZE The engine chambers are a labyrinth of
pipe-lined alleyways motorized chambers swaying catwalks
and pillars of steel The LIGHTING is very poor very dark

Hanover Pantucci Chin and Mamooli OPEN UP FIRING blindly
and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in
the darkness The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the
chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau We catch more
ABSTRACT GLIMPSES of the translucent TENTACLE-SACS strange
FEELERS groping SUCKERS SLIME and VEINS

CUT TO
DEEP IN MAZE - NIGHT 90

Finnegan rounds a corner and crouch-runs down a narrow alley
Alone now White-knuckling his rifle He turns another corner
and runs right into Trillian

FINNEGAN
AHHH

Spins gun ready to fire at

TRILLIAN
Noooo

FINNEGAN
Jesus Christ lady

TRILLIAN
(scared)
What are those things

FINNEGAN
I dont know

Finnegan looks around to the engine room a labyrinth of pipe
lined alleyways motorized chambers swaying catwalks and
pillars of steel The LIGHTING is very poor very dark He
takes off

TRILLIAN
Hey Hey Where are you going

FINNEGAN
theres got to be a way to
access out back there

He motions into the deep shadows

TRILLIAN
But what makes you think there

FINNEGAN

Trillian weighs her options and takes off after Finnegan

TRILLIAN
You dont have to be so touchy

FINNEGAN
Look lady I know you people are
used to getting your way

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN
Well you sure do a good imitation

TRILLIAN
Thank you I work at it

Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk He
starts to climb Trillian hampered by her long slinky dress
rips at the bottom making it maxi to mini in a flash and
scoots after Finnegan

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
I heard you say you grew up in the
projects in the Bronx

Reaching the top of the ladder she clambers onto the catwalk
next to Finnegan who is deciding which way to go

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Trillian Daley

She holds out her hand

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
ProjectsSouth Chicago

Finnegan ignores her hand

FINNEGAN

FINNEGAN
With the emphasis on SELF and in
selfish right

TRILLIAN
Takes one to know one

SNAP A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian
Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall

Finnegan falls onto the catwalk drops his rifle unarmed
Trillian freaked stumbles back and lands on her butt
Finnegan sits up against the walls turns and looks --

The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach
Trying to find its prey Finnegan is frozen in place
Watching Trillian sits up eyes widening in fear as she sees
-- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up
and down the Tentacle WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling
their way across the wall Getting closer and closer to
Finnegan

Finnegans eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillians
feet He motions for her to push it toward him But frozen
in fear she can only watch the slithering horror before her
Tongue-like the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall
FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head Then he BRUSHES
against some dirt making a SCRAPING SOUND

A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegans arm He

leaps to his feet So does Trillian She grabs the rifle
turns and bolts off down the dark alley Finnegan tries to
run but the Feelers hold him tight Two more Feelers slap
onto his arm HE YELLS

The Creature starts reeling him in

ANGLE ON Trillian running Finnegans YELL reaches her She
stops cold Looking back the way she came torn

ANGLE ON Finnegan fighting for all he is worth being
reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle
Whenout of the darkness Trillian suddenly comes running
back Panting hard she aims the gun

FINNEGAN
Shoot it Shoot it

Spurred to action Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the
tentacle and pulls the trigger Nothing happens

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
The safety The safety

Trillian frantically fumbles around looking for the right
lever on the complicated sophisticated weapon trying to
find it

TRILLIAN
I dont know where it is

FINNEGAN
On the side

Desperate unable to find it she does the next best
thingshe swings her rifle like its a baseball bat SMACKS
the TENTACLE HARD RIPPING into its flesh It SQUIRTS ink
blood releases Finnegan and recoils

Finnegan drops to his knees Grabbing his arm in pain The
tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again
Trillian grabs him and with all her strength jerks him to
his feet and starts to drag him backward The tentacle
coils ready to strike Just before it does so Finnegan
grabs the rifle with his one good arm flips the safety and
fires blasting the tentacle to pieces

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Lets get the hell out of here

Finnegan staggers to his feet He and Trillian run off
CUT TO
ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT 91

Trillian and Finnegan come running around a corner and stop

to catch their breath

FINNEGAN
(annoyed)

The safetythe safety He
flicks the safety on and off

FINNEGAN (CONTD)

Got it

TRILLIAN
(pissed)

TRILLIAN

Oh yeah What kind is that

FINNEGAN

TRILLIAN

Finnegans small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable

The Captain
Struggling
enmeshed he
Canton who

CUT TO
- NIGHT 92
is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web
frantic But the more he struggles the more
gets He holds his hands out beseechingly to

stands looking at him in terror

CAPTAIN

Help me

But Canton does not move All of a sudden Canton sees
something deep in the web behind the Captain which makes
his blood freeze

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
What is it

Canton takes a few steps back

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
What WHAT

The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it
is There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
HELP ME CANTON HELP MEEEEEEE

ANGLE ON Finnegan and Trillian racing across a catwalk
Below them they can see Canton backing away from the
Captain

FINNEGAN
Grab his hands

Canton looks up stunned as he sees Finnegan and Trillian
rushing down from the catwalk

CAPTAIN
CANTON HELP

Canton backs away from the Captain as the Captains struggle
draws him further into the web The Captains eyes bulge
horrified as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB
him from behind

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
IT HURTS IT
HURRRRRTTTTTSSSS

He struggles WILDLY Then starts to freeze up as the
tentacles wrap around him

Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is
slowly sucked deeper into the spider web his face and body
bady constricting paralyzed His VOICE is CHOKED OFF

Hanover Chin Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another
alleyway Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his
FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web They skid to a stop
Everybody piles up Eyes wide Watching as the Captains body
is pulled deeper into the dark web Tentacles enveloping him

HANOVER
(to Canton)
Where is the closest hatch

Canton still pressed against the wall staring at the spot
the Captain disappeared talking to himself
CANTON
I never meant for anyone to get
hurt it was supposed to be
clean

Hanover grabs Canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo
jacket

HANOVER
You hypocritical bastardall you
gave a shit about was the money
wheres the hatch

Canton points down a darkened passageway

HANOVER (CONTD)
Alright lets move outyou two on
point

He looks at an uneasy Mamooli and Chin

FINNEGAN
Joey Which ways aft

PANTUCCI
That way

He points in the opposite direction

HANOVER
Who gives a shit about aft

FINNEGAN
Thats where my boats moored

HANOVER
You trying to take over my show
Finnegan that what you trying to
do

FINNEGAN
Just trying to get to my boat

Finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction
that disappears in the dark Pantucci is right with him
Trillian a step behind

HANOVER
(yelling)
You stay away from that vault You
hear me

Just before he steps into the darkness Finnegan calls over
his shoulder

FINNEGAN

They respond to sound

He disappears into the dark Canton looks at Hanover for a
long moment and then takes off after Finnegan The other two
mercs look at Hanover wavering

HANOVER

(tense)
What

The sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around
nervously

MAMOOLI
(whispered)
He made sense

HANOVER
(Loud)
Hes a bloody

And then conscious of his voice reverberating

HANOVER (CONTD)
(whispered)
-hes a bloody taxi driver

Chin breaks for the catwalk hurrying after Finnegan Hanover
stands with a very antsy Mamooli steaming After a long
moment he strides off after Finnegan as well

CUT TO
BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY 93

In SLOW-MO Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened
pipe-lined passageway Guns out front Sight beams sweeping
the path ahead Eyes wide open Sweat sliding down their
faces Breath coming in short nervous bursts Hearts pounding
out of chests

The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension

Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON A creepy-looking
reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship Finnegan
continues on Followed by the others All sweating hard Eyes
nervously shifting Fear thick in the air

LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE we SEE Finnegan Trillian
and the others passing below Then suddenly in the dark
foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate They
come to a door Finnegan tries the handle No go Finnegan
turns to Canton and mimes for keys Canton shakes his head
He has none

HANOVER
(whispered)

Very good Finneganvery good

Trillian moves up to Finnegan She reaches into her hair and
pulls out her trusty lockpick As he watches somewhat
mystified she inserts the pin tickles the lock a few times
and depresses the handle Click The door opens Finnegan
looks at her curiously but with respect

CUT TO
BALLAST SECTION - DAY 94

They ENTER the rear ballast section where the walls are
indeed far apart half of which is now a small POND
Obviously flooded The only way out of this room is down some
STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater or through a single
violently twisted HATCH DOOR

Finnegan tries to push the hatch It will not give

Mamooli and Chin join him adding their considerable muscle
to the task The hatch holds tight Finnegan turns to Canton
who stands slumped against a railing He does not look well
at all

FINNEGAN
Whats on the far side

CANTON
I dont know

PANTUCCI
(nerves)
Its your damn ship What the hell
do you mean you dont know

Finnegan touches Pantuccis shoulder

FINNEGAN
Joey what difference does it
make

Finnegan enters the water

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
If you hear one shot you know I
made itstart coming

Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water
HANOVER
How do we know youre going to
signalhow do we know youre not

going to just take off

Finnegan stops

FINNEGAN
Ill wait here You go check it
out

Hanover does not move

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
(contemptuous)
I didnt think so

Finnegan wades into the water Just before he sinks beneath
the surface

TRILLIAN
Finnegan

He looks back

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Be careful

With a smile Finnegan dives under Pantucci right behind
him The others stand looking around nervous

CUT TO
UNDERWATER - NIGHT 95

Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast Then into a
passageway lined with black pipes Pantucci right behind him
STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters

CREAKS and MOANS Spooky shit Both men are wide-eyed as they
swim Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts
The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere Bubbles drift
up from the darkness below

The MUSIC IS TENSEVERY VERY TENSE Pantucci falls behind
He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM
AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS The fingers
on the dead hand seem to reach out for him He fights his way
past and swims off in a panic

CUT TO
BALLAST - NIGHT 96

Trillian stares down into the water Hanover keeps a sharp
nervous eye back down the catwalk white-knuckling his pulse
rifle Chin and Mamooli keep watch tight lipped Canton
paces back and forth driven by anxiety

HANOVER
Stop pacing

Canton acts as if he does not hear He keeps pacing Hanover
chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Cantons arm

Canton crumbles against the railing in pain

CANTON
AAAAHHHH

HANOVER
You deaf

TRILLIAN

Why dont you back off

HANOVER
You want some too

Hanovers jaw clenches He releases the safety on his rifle
the click resounding ominously in the hollow room

TRILLIAN
How brave we are

Trillians eyes fix on Hanovers unwavering A Mexican
standoff

MAMOOLI
Hanover

Everyone turn to A giant ball of black wet OOZING RUBBER
UNDULATES down the gangway Coming straight at them A mass
of glistening striated MUSCLE

HANOVER
Fire

The three men open up with their pulse rifles The CREATURE
gets RIPPED TO SHREDS Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS

everywhere But onward it comes Down the gangway

Trillian grabs the pistol off Chins utility belt and opens
fire Canton jumps into the water and disappears

CUT TO

Finnegan explodes to the surface GASPING for air He reaches
down and yanks a half drowned Pantucci up next to him They
both look up to gunfire exploding in the distance

CUT TO

The creature keeps coming The mercs keep firing Then
without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the

The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli Inches

Leaving only one route opena slim passageway

FINNEGAN
Like cattle

TRILLIAN
Youre saying they can think

FINNEGAN

Finnegan heads toward the passageway

CANTON
Do we have to go there

The ceiling left above them begins to torque and splits The
answer is plain Everyone runs into the passage just as the
ceiling comes down

CUT TO
PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 103

Finnegan leads them single-file they quickly head into a
SHAKING narrow void Fear has led to silence and unbearable
tension The walls on either side creak and moan with
strange noises

CUT TO
MID-HULL - NIGHT 104

Finnegan quickly comes out of the CREAKING MOANING GANGWAY
followed by the others All the STRANGE NOISES suddenly STOP
Everything gets quiet Finnegan freezes Somethings wrong
Everybody looks around STEAM SHOOTS OUT from multiple pipes
The air is thick with MIST

TRILLIAN
Whats the matter

FINNEGAN
The quiet

HANOVER
Maybe we lost them

FINNEGAN
Or maybe were exactly where they
want us to be

Finnegan moves on The others follow Guns out front TENSE
They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a
soul-wrenching nightmare The CREATURES NEST -- OR STOMACH

Across a small portion of the ships midsection is a huge
GELATINOUS WOMB Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow
JELL-O with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it

If it werent all so horrific it would be considered
beautiful Inside the womb A DOZEN HUMANS passengers float
around in some kind of twisted embryonic state the living
dead They all seem to be breathing the gelatin Several
TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff which divides and re
forms in some sort of strange mitosis

Finnegan and the others look at the passengers horrified
But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at
them Many start to reach out seemingly in slow motion as
their hands ooze through the thick gelatin Trillian looks
sick trembles in fear

TRILLIAN
What is it

FINNEGAN
A meat locker

TRILLIAN
We cant just leave them here

Canton looks like hes about to throw up he starts backing
away heading for a side hatch

CANTON
I can

In the womb a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young
LADY The Lady tries to back-pedal away but because of the
gelatin its like one of those nightmares where you can only
move in slow motion The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh She
tries to scream but her face is already starting to
constrict her whole body is being paralyzed Pantucci is so
horrified hes about to cry

PANTUCCI
Oh nooh God please no

The TENTACLE-SAC gloms onto the Ladys forehead THROUGH THE
SAC we can SEE her SKIN MELTING The only thing she can move
are her EYES which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she
is imbibed alive Our heroes are frozen in fear Until the
Ladys EYES LIQUEFY

Trillian burries her head in Finnegans shoulder trying to
shut out the horror

FINNEGAN
We cant do anything for them
Lets go

He begins to lead her toward the hatchwhen her eyes
recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair The old
lady seems to see her too Her hands read out IMPLORING Her
mouth silently shapes the words HELP ME Just as a tentacle
comes creeping toward her

TRILLIAN
NOOO

Her rage rises She hefts her rifle and starts blasting

away

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
You wont get her You wont

Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin
BLASTING IT AWAY But the bullets only manage to go about
twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop
GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place TRACER HOLES STREAK

through the stuff But all the bullets are sliding short

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Finnegando something Please

Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling
where most of the Tentacles are coming from Their long TAILS
WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes A bas-relief of
horror Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades
off Hanovers utility belt

HANOVER
Finnegan No

bites the pins and spits them out

FINNEGAN
Eat this

He chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO
safely clear of the passengers

is badly constricted His body paralyzed He clings to a
black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg
Its already to his hip He grasps desperately for his
pistol just beyond his reach on the floor This guy aint

hand winch-line in the other The whole METAL MESS is
BUCKING and TWISTING and SCREECHING His every joint is being
ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the
line before the entire rig tears away into the sea

With one last heroic effort of will and grit he snaps the
clip in place just as it all BREAKS LOOSE One of the JET
SKIS and the ENTIRE RAILING are RIPPED over the side and fall
down into the ocean Finnegan is also YANKED over the side

him the rest of the way up He half collapses on top of her

GELATIN start to MOVE She struggles wildly

Panicked Finnegan ENTERS the room Spots Trillian Starts
sloshing his way through the water Trillian sees him coming

TRILLIAN
Finnegan

Trillian looks back Sees the Tentacles coming out of the
darkness of the web Twenty feet back and closing

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Hurry Hurry

Finnegan runs up and grabs her Tries to pull her free But
shes stuck good He looks behind her to the tentacles
quickly closing in on her Now fifteen feet away

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
Get me out of here

As she struggles Finnegan pulls out his knife and starts to
hack away at the sticky webbing Trillian tries to look
behind her

FINNEGAN

Trillian struggles with every last ounce of her strength Now
ten feet away

TRILLIAN

Finnegan hacks away with desperate urgency Now five feet

FINNEGAN

Finnegan plunges his hands into the goo Trillian latches
onto Finnegans wrists he onto hers Four feet

FINNEGAN (CONTD)

Finnegan strains pulling until every muscle in his body
keens with the effort every vein pops to the surface
Trillian pushes for all she is worth Three feettwo

With a last gargantuan effort Finnegan yanksTrillian
comes tearing out of the webbingthe remnants of her gown
doesntin the nick of time

The tentacle rushes forward Finnegan jams his pulse-rifle
into the web and OPENS FIRE Blasting the entire clip into
the goo Tearing the shit out of it BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM

And thats when the whole ROOM starts to QUAKE And SHAKE
Finnegan and Trillian both look down at their feet as they
hear the LOWER DECKS EXPLODING UPWARD one at a time -- BAM
- BAM -- BAM Something is rising up through the ship He
grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit She scoops her
fallen pulse rifle off the floor

FINNEGAN
Go Go Go

He shoves her out the door and is about to follow when the
door is slammed shut in his face

TRILLIAN (VO)
Finnegan

FINNEGAN
Get to the jet ski Go

CUT TO

HALLWAY - NIGHT 144

Trillian stands there pulling on the door half naked The
door is bolted tight She has not other options She runs
off

CUT TO
FRISCO BAR - NIGHT 145

Finnegan turns as the DANCE FLOOR and the DJ BOOTH EXPLODE
as SOMETHING RISES UP from below them His eyes widen And
there it is -- The huge horrible mutated mucus-covered
sucker-faced HEAD OF THE CREATURE

A giant mutated protoplasm Jutting up from a breach in the
floor The trunk of the Creature the part where all the
Tentacles come from is below the next deck A slimy
translucent MEMBRANE slowly RISES REVEALING what appears to
be some sort of ORGANIC LIQUID EYE It seems to stare right
at Finnegan who is transfixed by the sight A Tentacle
slowly starts to move in on Finnegan

Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris
that blocks his shot The EYEBALL-type organism follows him
Another Tentacle starts to move Silently undulating through
the water towards Finnegan The membrane over the EYE moves
And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill They
are surrounding Finnegan Finnegan comes around the shattered
DJ booth Faces the Creature full-on He cant miss He
gives it a wicked smile

FINNEGAN
Get a good look

In SLOW-MOTION Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle It DRIPS
WATER He jams the gun-butt into his hip Takes aim -- FIRES
But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES
OUT and GRABS him JERKS him into the air His pulse-rifle
goes flying Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into
the floor and the death that awaits him

He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer
closer He is about to disappear down the hole of no return
when his hand comes up with his knife He slashes the
tentacle in two scrambles up and heads for an open door As
he reaches the door a tentacle rises up in front of him
Huge Blocking his way Its maw opens wide A terrifying
sight of jaws and teeth and death About to devour him As it
strikes forward Finnegan draws his shotgun and blasts the
vile thing to smithereens He bolts through the door several
Tentacles already after him

CUT TO
WATERSPORTS PLATFORM - NIGHT 146

Trillian sits up on the jet ski She hears the GUNFIRE

TRILLIAN
FINNEGAN COME ON

CUT TO
PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT 147

Finnegan runs wildly down a passageway He rounds a corner A
TENTACLE SIDE-SWIPES him Hard SMASHES him into a wall
Finnegan DROPS the shotgun Hits the floor running Another
TENTACLES CHECKS him Sends him SPIRALING through a hatch

Finnegan TUMBLES in Face-first Quickly rolls over and looks
back -- A TENTACLE LASHES in through the doorway Finnegan
back-pedals on his hands and feet stumbling over various
sports equipment The TENTACLE homes-in on him CHARGES
FORWARD Finnegan hurls himself backwards THROWING anything
that comes to hand at the Tentacle A VOLLEYBALL A WATERSKI
A TACKLE BOX A FRISBEE But onward it comes Finnegan back
pedals faster Over diving gear Scuba tanks Fins and masks

The TENTACLE RISES About to STRIKE

Finnegan backs into the wall Trapped He spots a SPEARGUN
Grabs it

The TENTACLE LUNGES Finnegan FIRES NAILS IT PINS IT to the
wall Finnegan scrambles past the furiously WRITHING TENTACLE
and runs out of the room

CUT TO
WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT 148

Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into
the dark water She frantically whispers to herself

TRILLIAN
Oh my God oh my God

Suddenly twenty feet from the jet ski SOMETHING SWIRLS
through the water Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it Eyes
wide Knuckles white Breathing hard WHAMM Something drops
onto the ski behind her

TRILLIAN (CONTD)
EEEEYYYYAAAHHH

She turns ghost whiteto Finnegan

FINNEGAN

FINNEGAN

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN

He grabs Trillians pulse rifle and leaps up on the side of
the Saipan and scales up to the deck Trillian watches him
and then looks at the watch

CUT TO
SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT 149
Finnegan bursts in

FINNEGAN
Pantucci JOEY

Then he spots something on the floor He reaches down and
picks it up Its Pantuccis leather tool belt Its been
RIPPED TO SHREDS Finnegan stares at it His grip tightening
Tears rising in his eyes His jaw clenching Then he flings
the belt aside Filled with rage

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Time to die motherfucker

Finnegan hits the ignition button A desperate moment of dry
cranking and then the one remaining engine catches
sputters and fires to life

CUT TO

FUJI MARU - NIGHT 150

Trillian hears the Saipans engine come to life She hits the
ignition on the jet ski Right next to her something drops
from the deck of the Saipan into the water Finnegan clambers
up in front of her His pulse rifle still in hand

TRILLIAN
Wheres you friend

FINNEGAN
Hes not coming

The Saipan strains on its leashes ENGINES GUNNING Finnegan
swings his rifle around OPENS UP on the tie-lines All the
TIE-LINES SHRED The Saipan starts to break free

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Hold on

He GUNS the skiand it stalls The jet ski stalls Goes
dead in the water

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Oh shit

Nearby the WATER SWIRLS violently He hammers the starter
button

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Come on

The ENGINE STUTTERS He tries again

FINNEGAN (CONTD)
Come on

Another STUTTER More WATER SWIRLS getting closer now But
the third times a charm The jet ski comes to life and
shoots off along the side of the ship Just as a tentacle
comes shooting out of the water Finnegan fires at it
blowing it to pieces The last TIE-LINE SNAPS The SAIPAN
LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru The jammed steering-sticks
force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle

FAST 151

Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski Pedal
to the metal Looking straight ahead Trillian holds on for
dead life Suddenly a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski
Finnegan cranks the handlebars The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS
The Saipan starts to arc around The WARHEAD gleams in the
MOONLIGHT Dripping water Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the
Fuji Maru ENGINE ROARING Throwing water Another WAVE
EXPLODES A tentacle rears up Right in front of the jet ski
Finnegan and Trillian lean hard The JET SKI SKIDS sideways
across the water

BOUNCING HARD

Trillian cant hold on Flips off the back Skips across the
water Finnegan ROARS away A tentacle hard on his ass
Trillian pops to the surface Treads water Panicked Watches
Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind Finnegan looks

back at Trillian Bobbing in the water The he looks at the
Saipan Continuing its arc Its deadly payload racing for the
Fuji Maru Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS SMASHES through a
wave and heads for Trillian Trillian sees him and swims
hard The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru The warhead
perfectly positioned to strike its hull Only fifty meters
away Now forty Now thirty-five

FASTER 152

Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski Slides up next to
Trillian Grabs her by her arm Rips her out of the water
Throws her onto the back of the jet ski Just as a tentacles
rises up lashing out He GUNS IT SMASHES through the waves
The WARHEAD SPLASHES through the water The jet ski hauls
ass

ENGINES WHINING OUT

Faster and faster A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front
of the jet ski A tentacle slaps down hard Finnegan cuts
hard Too late The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser

They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water The
SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD

Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru No twenty
meters away Now fifteen

Finnegan pops to the surface Looks around Cant find
Trillian He DIVES under the water His POV Tentacles
converging on him from the murky depths The retrieve
feature thats on all jet skis forces it back around towards
where Finnegan and Trillian fell off Finnegan BURST to the
surface Holding Trillian She looks nearly lifeless The jet
ski heads right at them Finnegan swims for it Dragging
Trillian As tentacles converge from all sides

The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water Swallowed
whole Finnegan quickly reverses Backstrokes like mad The
WARHEAD SLICES through the water Now only ten meters away
from hitting the Fuji Maru

Now nine meters away Now eight Seven Six Five

GO INTO SLO-MO NOW AS 153

Finnegan paddles hard Sucking in as much water as he is air
A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water Looms above Finnegan
and Trillian Dripping water About to strike Theres
nowhere to hide Finnegan paddles harder

COME OUT OF SLOW-MO AS 154

The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE And thats when the
SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull

BA-WHOOOOOOMMM

The SAIPAN EVAPORATES
METAL FLIES
WATER SPRAYS

FIRE FILLS the night sky The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru
CARTWHEELS across the waves The Tentacle above Finnegan
drops like lead And just lies there Quivering Another
EXPLOSION LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea
Sends shock waves across the water

Blows Finnegans hair back He swims on Towards the island
Pulling Trillian The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU
SMOLDER and SINK BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface

A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves WATER SIZZLES and
STEAMS SMOKE drifts into the night sky Debris coats the
water

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
BEACH - SUNRISE 155

Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the
beach of the island

They collapse next to each other Finnegan is exhausted
Trillian coughs up seawater They both turn and look out to
sea and the rising sun Trillian reaches into her bra and
pulls out the egg sized diamond She holds it up The sun
refracts off it brilliantly

Trillian looks at the diamond looks around at the picture
perfect island the picture perfect sunsetand then she
heaves it as far as she can into the sea For the first time
since they know each other there is nobody around No people
No tentacles And when they look at each other something
else comes to mind besides survival

Finnegan moves towards Trillian Trillian moves towards
Finnegan Their lips move closer closer

And then down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
WATER Scares the shit out of them The audience too

But its just Pantucci Looking waterlogged and shell-
shocked Coughing up half the sea Finnegan and Trillian help
him to his feet

PANTUCCI
Was it the water in my eyes or were
you guys about to

FINNEGAN
Joey
PANTUCCI
Because its cool you know I can
always take a walk or something
down the beach

FINNEGAN
Joey

PANTUCCI
Or I could go fora
swimalthough I gotta tell
youif I never get in the water
again

BOTH
Joey

PANTUCCI
OKOKyou dont have to beg me
Ill stick around

And then they head the most gut-wrenching spine-tingling
teeth- shattering ROAR ever Pure primeval Like no sound or
animal or thing weve ever hear beofre Coming from DEEP
WITHIN THE ISLAND

PANTUCCI (CONTD)
Or maybe not

Finnegan Trillian and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND
We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up MORE STRANGE
NOISES ARE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES

WE KEEP PULLING BACK REVEALING more of this creepy-looking
island And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach

WE KEEP PULLING BACK REVEALING pieces of the smoldering
ship Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now Dark jungles

Craggy mountains Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth

FINNEGAN (V0O)
What now

The THING ROARS again Its hellacious
AND WE CUT TO BLACK

THE END
