Italian called Tindle

MILO
My fathers name is Tindolini

ANDREW

contempt

MILO
Thats your own experience is it

ANDREW

ANDREW (CONTD)
What Im getting at is this You

Anyway Ive got a lovely mistress
She runs a Sauna in Swindon Shes

INT ANDREWS HOUSE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

ANDREW
Its a close fit isnt it for
two

INT ANDREWS HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGRT

The elevator stops They get out

INT ANDREWS HOUSE’ - BAR AREA - NIGHT

ANDREW pours drinks

Silence

ANDREW
Listen Im going to make you a
proposition A few years ago I gave
her some jewels Amazingly
expensive Well I didnt give them
to her I own them Theyre insured
in my name But I let her wear them-
-on special occasions Theyre
worth half a million pounds They
spend half their time in the bank
or in my safe At the moment
theyre in the safe in this house
I want you to steal them

MILO
Steal them

ANDREW
Thats right

MILO
What the hell do you mean

ANDREW
I mean I want you to steal the
jewels

MILO
You want me to steal the jewels

ANDREW
Thats right

MILO
I dont get it

ANDREW
Its very simple Steal them Sell
them abroad Live happily ever
after with Maggie Ill claim the
insurance money--they1ll have to
pay up Ill have got rid of my
wife and Ill be as happy as a pig
in shit and you can keep Maggie in
the manner to which she has become
accustomed Sounds like a fair
bargain to me

MILO
You want me to take part in a
scummy little plot to defraud your
insurance company Is that it

ANDREW
Scummy I think its quite elegant

MILO
What do you think I am I mean
what the fuck are you actually
talking about

ANDREW
Real facts

MILO
This is a joke

ANDREW
No it isnt

MILO
Its also a trap

ANDREW
A trap
Pause

MILO
Yes its some kind of trap You
think Im a fool

ANDREW
Well are you

MILO
Anyway it doesnt hold up

ANDREW
Why not

MILO
You say theyre worth half a
million pounds

ANDREW
Correct

MILO
Well youd only get a fraction of
that--fram any fence

ANDREW
Ive already contacted a friend of
mine in Amsterdam Hell give you
£400000 tax free Think of it
£400000 tax free

MILO
Why would he do that

ANDREW
Because when you steal the jewels
you also steal the receipts So
hell have the title to the jewels
as well as the jewels themselves
So when he sells them hell get the
full value Get it Think about it
Take your time

INT ANDREWS HOUSE - SEATING AREA - NIGHT

MILO
And why would you do all this

ANDREW

Listen Under my crooked exterior
Im a simple honest man What Ive
said to you is true I swear it I
want to get rid of my wife But I
want it to be solid--permanent I
dont want her on my back I want
her to stay on your back

MILO
This is a frame up

ANDREW
Frame up How

MILO
You want to destroy me You want to
see me in jail You get me to do
this and then shop me to the
police

ANDREW

No no If I shop you youll shop
me So wed both end up in jail
No listen I take a strictly moral
position in all this My wife is an
adulteress She should actually be
stoned to death But anyway its
up to you Make up your own mind

MILO
Are you asking me to trust you

ANDREW
I dont give a fuck if you trust me
er not This is a very simple
proposition You have an expensive
woman and no money If you want to
keep her--steal the jewels

MILO
Why dont you steal the jewels and
give them to me

ANDREW
Dont be silly The burglary has to
look real The house has to be
broken in to

MILO
Well why dont you break into it

ANDREW
For Christs sake Im in it How
can I break into it I live here

INT ANDREWS HOUSE - BACK WINDOW AREA - NIGHT

MILO walks to the window He looks out ANDREW watches
him

MILO
(slowly)
Ok If I were to agree to do this
would you agree to the divorce

ANDREW
Why would I agree to the divorce if
youre both walking away with
£400000

MILO
She wants a legal settlement She
wants part of your estate

ANDREW
Greedy

MILO
Its legal justice

ANDREW
Never trust legal justice You know
what legal justice is Its farting
Annie Laurie down a key hole
Listen £400000 tax free All
yours Cash Why dont you stop
pissing about

MILO
But--wait a minute--you get
£500000--from the insurance

ANDREW
Sure I do All right Ill be
frank I need it Cash flow Stocks
and shares going down the drain
Get me Its quid pro quo You do
me a favour--I do you a favour And
you keep the woman

MILO sips his drink

MILO
OK Lets make a deal

ANDREW
What deal

MILO
I break in I steal the jewels and
you agree to the divorce Thats
the deal Otherwise fuck it Thats
another quid pro quo But you have
to shake on it

ANDREW stares at him

ANDREW
(slowly)
All right I shake on it Heres my
hand

They shake hands

BLACK
So this guy had a sense of humour
Is that what youre saying

ANDREW
Oh yes Oh yes he left this house
with a twinkle in his eye

BLACK
So tell me--what was the point of
all of this

ANDREW
Humiliation Its nice to see your
wifes lover a shivering
frightened fucking wreck in front
of you But as a matter of fact I
quite liked him I found him
attractive I thought we might
become good friends The shortest
way to a mans heart is as Im
sure you know humiliation It
binds you together

BLACK
You found him attractive

ANDREW
I was trying to stand in my wifes
shoes in a manner of speaking I
was trying to find out what
attracted her to him

BLACK
And did you

ANDREW
Oh yes He was really terribly
sweet I could see why she fancied
him

BLACK
I could see why he fancies her I
thought she was very tasty myself

ANDREW
Really «

BLACK
Oh yes Sumptuous Ready for
action

forty-five Perhaps even fifty-
five Or even a bit longer

follow you
