INT A DINING ROOM - THE FRENCH QUARTER NEW ORLEANS - LATE1
MORNING

An Underwood typewriter circa 1973 with an empty page in
it

EDGAR ECKMANN mid-30s sleepless eyes some version of a
literary rock-star sits at the head of a dining room table
and looks just above the page into some thought

ALICE a young woman clad in a black tank-top and not much
else walks in

ALICE
How’s it coming

No answer as he grimaces at the empty page in front of him

ALICE (CONTD)
That well

EDGAR
Do I have anything today

ALICE
I’m covering your class Again

EDGAR
Isn’t there something else

ALICE
You’ve got a reading next week at
Beckham’s Bookshop and the
Louisana Writer Award thing on the
riverboat

EDGAR
(half-attentive)
Are you writing my speech

ALICE
Wasn’t planning on it
EDGAR
Can you write it
ALICE
Nope
EDGAR

Please My mind’s gone to shit My
writing’s gone to shit I’m not
even sure what story I’m in
anymore
ALICE
(suggestive)
What’1ll you do for me

EDGAR
Grade your dissertation

ALICE
(again suggestive)
Wanna take a break

EDGAR
Not really
ALICE
I‘ll be in the bedroom when you

want to
He remains at the table faintly shakes his head
He looks to a business card on the table next to the
typewriter The Roman numeral II is printed on it He looks
up to a photo of a woman on a nearby shelf then back down at
the empty sheet of paper in front of him

Title card TOO

INT A BEDROOM THE TUTTLE RESIDENCE - DENVER COLORADO
MORNING

FRED TUTTLE mid-30s eerily resembling Edgar Eckmann sits
up on the side of his bed with his bed-head

The clock reads seven am

BONNIE his wife lies way on
back to him

He peers back at her a beat

EXT TUTTLE RESIDENCE - A LITT

the other side of the bed her

then stands up into his day

LE LATER THAT MORNING

Fred the type of guy who could disappear and you might not

notice emerges from the modes
tie and Dockers

t house in his yellow oxford

He walks over to his Honda Civic and gets in a Scent-Sations
car freshener hangs from the rearview
INT A CLASSROOM ARAPAHOE HIGH SCHOOL - DENVER COLORADO
MID-DAY

Fred stands next to the chalkboard in front of a class of
DIVERSE SOPHOMORES

He writes “WHAT DID THIS MAN WANT” on the board alongside a
quotation “SO WE BEAT ON BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT BORNE
BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST” He turns and looks out at
them

FRED
So what significance do these lines
have for our understanding of the
book as a whole

A FEW STUDENTS look to their copies of “The Great Gatsby”
but there’s no response

FRED (CONT’D)
What did we say the main theme of
the book was last week

A NERDY FRIZZY HAIRED STUDENT Kimberly raises her hand

Fred looks around at the rest of his class hoping for
interest from someone else

FRED (CONT’D)
Kimberly

KIMBERLY
Dreams

FRED
Okay SureWe discussed the
achievement of dreams and what
effect that has on the characters
right

KIMBERLY
Right

FRED
All the characters in Gatsby have a
dream Some have achieved their
dream and accepted this some have
achieved their dream and like
boats against the current try to
recapture their dream

(MORE )
FRED (CONTD)
However according to Fitzgerald
this is unrealistic because once
dreams are achieved they’re
corrupted and can never be achieved
again

He stands there at the mercy of the class No response
FRED (CONT’D)
(defeated)
Soum

A KID WITH AN IPOD BRYAN chimes in

BRYAN
Fitzgerald sucks my balls

Some of the class laughs

FRED
Bryanthat’s um that’s

The bell rings THE CLASS bursts from their seats
FRED (CONT’D)
Please finish the book for
Fridayplease

Kimberly gathers her things and steps toward the door

KIMBERLY
Have a nice day Mr Tuttle

FRED
You too

BRYAN
Later Tuttle

FRED
(muffled)
Mr Tuttle Bryan
Bryan points at him mockingly and walks out
Fred is left standing in the empty classroomhe sniffles
stuck in a thought for a moment

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Fred trudges out of the classroom through the SWARMS OF
BUSTLING STUDENTS unnoticed
A FORTY-SOMETHING WOMAN dressed in a nice suit off the rack
from Neimans discreetly observes Fred walk away next to a
water fountain

As he walks by she nods to TWO MEN dressed like janitors
carrying shoulder bags who hurry down the hall and enter
into the empty classroom She waits outside the door as they
go through Fred’s desk take photos and poke around
TWO TEENAGED GIRLS pass by and give her a weird look

GILDA

Get to class slackers

EXT CHERRY HILLS VILLAGE LITTLETON - A BIT LATER 6

Fred emerges from Rite Aid lugging his shoulder bag a
plastic Rite Aid bag a bouquet of daisies

He’s followed by a champagne Chrysler Sebring driven by the
woman from the school hallway who now sips a Frappuccino

Fred reaches the crosswalk and notices A MAN dragging off a
cigarette waiting on the opposite curb from him

The woman sits in her car idling at the light parallel to and
just behind him

The light turns green

Fred begins to cross the street and the man begins to cross
toward him

The woman in the Chrysler passes them

As they get closer Fred looks up at the man

It’s Edgar Eckmann

Fred double takes stops a moment thunderstruck

His lips part as if he wants to say something his eyes
narrowIt’s uncannyAside from his style the man is in
every respect what would be called Fred’s double

As Edgar passes he stares back for a moment with subtle
fascination and gives Fred a brief indifferent look He
takes a pull off his cigarette and continues on leaving

Fred in the middle of the crosswalk

A car horn honks
Fred snaps out of it The light has changed again and he’s
blocking the oncoming traffic He quickly crosses to get out
of the way and stops at the curb to look back

Edgar has disappeared

EXT TUTTLE RESIDENCE - LATER THAT EVENING 7

Fred walks up to the house He pauses a moment before walking
in

After he does an unmarked van pulls up across the street and
parks

INT TUTTLE RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS 8

He enters the foyer some dying daisies in a vase on a table
in the modest room

He sets his bag down and takes a folder of papers out of
itHe walks into the adjacent kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 9

BONNIE TUTTLE mid-30s vanilla in her chinos blouse and
cheap Keds sits in front of an aging PC surrounded by note
pads and a Diet RC Cola while typing something on her Scent-
Sations sales web-site

Fred looks at her standing there with the flowers
FRED
(weakly)
Hi
BONNIE
GoodHow was yours

Fred squints

FRED
FineI think I might have seen my
evil twinor something

BONNIE
That’s nice

INT VAN - SAME TIME 10
The two janitors and the woman from earlier sit in the back

with a bunch of sound equipment Chex Mix and coffee
listening to Fred and Bonnie

INT - TUTTLE RESIDENCE - SAME TIME 11

FRED
I picked up your Prilosec

He puts the Rite Aid bag and the flowers on the counter then
takes some small bills out of his pocket and puts them in a
Donald Duck cookie jar on the kitchen counter as Bonnie
continues to type on the computer

BONNIE
Ummhe’s in the tub

Fred stares at the back of her head a moment then walks out
of the kitchen leaving Bonnie there
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 12
BONNIE (0S)
Oh we’re having dinner with

everyone tomorrow night

Fred grimaces and continues down the hall

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 13
Fred enters to see his son ERNIE 8 and sharp as a tack
emerge from his bubble bath wearing a snorkel and diving
mask

Fred takes a seat on the toilet with his folder

FRED
Whatcha looking for

ERNIE
Whale migrations

FRED
How ya doing Ern

ERNIE
Not well
FRED
What’s going on

ERNIE
Well this whole Pluto thing’s
still messing with my head

FRED
How’s that

ERNIE
Imagine you’re a planet for seventy-
six years and one day you’re
floating in the solar system
minding your business and out of
nowhere a bunch of people decide
you’re not a planet anymore

FRED
Yep that’s tough stuff

ERNIE
Pluto got the shaft

FRED
Yeah but Pluto’s still Pluto

ERNIE
No he isn’t He’s lost his
identity

FRED
Okay then

ERNIE
Dad

FRED
Yeah

ERNIE

If I got the chance to go to outer
space would you let me go

FRED
How do you mean

ERNIE
Like if we were taking a field trip
to Pluto at school and Mrs
Jenkins wouldn’t let any of us go
without a permission slip

FRED
I don’t know I’d miss you a lot

ERNIE
Pluto dad

Fred thinks a beat

FRED
Would you let me go

ERNIE
Of course

Fred pulls a piece of notebook paper out of his folder and

the pen from his shirt pocket and writes “Ernie may go to
Pluto Best Fred Tuttle” He shows it to Ernie who gives

him a grin

ERNIE (CONTD)
Thanks dad

Fred winks at him and they sit there a moment

ERNIE (CONTD)
Can we go to Colorado Ocean Journey
this weekend

FRED
It’s up to your mother

ERNIE
(skeptical)
I’m going back under

He puts on his mask snorkel and submerges

INT TGI FRIDAY’S - THE NEXT EVENING 14

Boz Scaggs or something adult contemporary plays in the
background

ETHAN
All it takes is a turn of the head
on some Thursday afternoon at
exactly the wrong time

Fred looks down into a grilled cheese and fries He takes a
bite and realizes it’s too hot He stops chewing opens his
mouth and breaths in and out to cool it off

MATLE
Oh Christ Ethan

ETHAN SMILEY late 30s hefty in a Tiger Woods Nike golf

BONNIE
Didn’t she just get her tubes tied

JAN
That was the rumor

BONNIE
Or wasn’t it him

Fred looks around at the table nothing about this is
enjoyable to him He takes a sip of lemonade and notices -
THE WOMAN who’s been following him at an adjacent table
looking at him They meet eyesShe winks

Fred puzzled turns around to see if she’s looking at
someone behind him Then he turns back and she’s still
looking at him Fred looks down into his food for a
momentHe eventually looks back up to take another peek

She’s walking away His brow furrows
Bonnie looks over to Ethan’s plate
BONNIE (CONTD)

(to Ethan)
Can I have one of your fries

ETHAN
Go for it

Bonnie a few drinks in reaches for one of Ethan’s French
fries

Fred notices and looks to the perfectly good fries on his
plate

MAILE
How the hell do you hear these
things

JAN

Highlands RanchDownsizing He
said he feels “emotionally
hijacked” whatever that means

MATLE
There’s something to be said for
complacency

FRED
Not really

Everyone pauses surprised that Fred said somethingBonnie
looks to him disconcerted by his remark but smothers it

ETHAN
(slightly condescending)
Thanks for contributing Tuttle

FRED
It was more of a comment

An awkward beat as Fred shares a look with Ethan but says
nothing elseEthan looks back to Bonnie

ETHAN
(to Bonnie)
You got some ketchup on your chin

Bonnie tries to wipe it away but missesso Ethan reaches
with his napkin to get it smirking

Fred watches the interaction as Bonnie gets embarrassed

FRED
Excuse me for a moment

Fred gets up and heads to the rest-room Bonnie watches him
go

TOM
Sowho are the Broncos playing
this weekend

INT TGI FRIDAY’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 15
Fred stands at a urinal

When the WOMAN from the adjacent table walks into the men’s
room behind him

Fred tightens uncomfortably as he realizes it’s her and that
she’s standing there looking at him

FRED
You realize this is the men’s room

She studies him as he looks over to her then averts his eyes

GILDA
Yep

FRED
So

She reaches into her purse to procure what looks like a
business card

GILDA
You recall seeing a familiar
looking man on the street the other
day looks like you not exactly a
tad scruffier but close enough

FRED
(confused)
Yeah

GILDA
You ever wish you could’ve lived
some other life

FRED
Um

GILDA
You seemed thrilled to be at that
dinner table but if you’re even
the slightest bit interested come
see me

She slips the card into Fred’s shirt-pocket and walks out

Fred pulls out the card - The Roman numeral II is printed on
the top side just like the one Edgar Eckmann had Fred flips
the card overthere’s an address hand-written on it in
black ink Hyatt Regency 200 West 48th Avenue Room 202
Anytime tomorrow

EXT TGI FRIDAY’S PARKING LOT - AFTER DINNER 16

Fred and Bonnie walk up to their Civic

The unmarked van from earlier is parked nearby but Fred
doesn’t notice it

They both get into the Civicbuckle their seat belts

BONNIE
You used to open the door for me

FRED
I used to do a lot of things

She shakes her head faintly as Fred looks ahead quietly
never looks to her

BONNIE
Don’t take your unhappiness out on
me

FRED

You should talk

BONNIE
What should I say Fred

FRED
Huh

BONNIE
What should I say That you could
be more of a man

FRED
If you werent so cold

BONNIE
If you weren’t so pathetic
(regretting)I’m not cold

FRED
What are you doing

BONNIE
I’m resenting you

FRED
(incredulous )
You’re resenting me

BONNIE
YesWhy do you even show up I
might as well be sitting next to an
empty chair

FRED
You want an empty chair Drive
yourself home

Fred gets out of the car and shuts the door leaving her
sitting with the silence

EXT HYATT REGENCY CENTRAL DENVER - THE NEXT DAY 17

Fred holds the business card in his hand and stands looking
skeptically at the hotel

INT HYATT REGENCY - MOMENTS LATER 18

Fred walks down a stale hallway counting the numbers on the
hotel room doors

He notices TWO AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN 40s sitting on two
fold out chairs up ahead adjacent to the door of room 202

Fred surveys them curiously They fill out what looks like
paper work They also happen to resemble each other although
they have different hair and clothing styles one dressed
like Condoleezza Rice the other in a sweat-suit

Fred hears a voice from inside the room but stands there a
moment puzzled

FRED
(a bit sheepish)
Is this a line

The woman in the sweat-suit looks up to him
WOMAN

Nope We’re finished Just trading
some informationShe’s in there

FRED
(confused but going with
it)
Thanks

He cautiously raises his hand to knock

GILDA’S VOICE (0S)
Uhuh uhuhyeahuhuh

He knocks

GILDA’S VOICE (0S) (CONT’D)
(a bit loud)
It’s open

He opens the door kept open by the latch and reluctantly
steps into the haze of cigarette smoke that hangs in the
large room

The woman who gave him the card GILDA MUNRO sits at a round
table near the window

She looks at Fred but continues her Skype conversation She
speaks into a Bluetooth headset while leaning back in a chair
in front of a laptop talking to a woman who looks a whole lot
like her On the table rests a folder some note-pads a
portable printer a few eight by ten photos of Fred Edgar
Bonnie the two women outside the room

The two men who were dressed as janitors now in plain
clothes sit typing on two lap-tops trolling through what
look like photos of people’s faces at a desk across the room
One looks up at Fred then back to his computer Fred notices
they look exactly alike

GILDA

(a bit hard)
If he’s getting cold feet tell him
that he’s exercising his right to
waste his lifeNo no don’t say
that I’m kiddingIt’s just
Lansing Michigan to Corpus Christi
is a pretty decent swap It could
be Nome Alaska or West Buttcrack
Arkansas so tell him to contemplate
thatThe Texas coast is probably
nice this time of yearYeah
yeahListen one of mine just
walked inUhuh to be
continuedWell people change
when they have to not when you
tell them toYeah right

She looks up at Fred again who’s a little frightenedShe
ends the call takes the headset off her ear puts out her
cigarette in one of the Starbucks cups

GILDA (CONTD)
You showed

FRED
Um

He pulls the card with the “II” on it out of his pocket and
shows it to her

GILDA
So how long do you want to do this

FRED
Do what

GILDA
We have a one week minimum at
fifteen thousand dollars per week
although the claimant has
volunteered to cover all costs
airfare and a generous advance of
three thousand cash and another
three on completion

She puts an envelope full of cash on the table in front of
him Fred eyes it

GILDA (CONTD)
As this is somewhat of a special
case due to the somewhat high
profile of your double other or
whatever you want to call him he’s
also been generous enough to offer
use of his American Express card

She grabs a document from the table

FRED

over

Where
EXT THE TUTTLE RESIDENCE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 19
EDGAR ECKMANN Fred’s doppelganger with sad eyes sits
waiting on the curb in front of Fred’s house eating a pack of

MandMs

The Chrysler Sebring rolls up into the driveway followed by
Freds Civic

Gilda steps out of her car as Fred steps out of his
Edgar walks toward them He looks at Fred who uncomfortably
looks back at him again thunderstruck at the apparition of

himself

GILDA
Fred Tuttle meet Edgar Eckmann

EDGAR
Pleasure

Edgar puts out his hand for a shake but Fred stammers
staring at him dumbfoundedeventually he reaches out for
Edgar’s hand gives a weak shake and they all stand there
awkwardly as Fred continues to stare

EDGAR (CONTD)
Thanks for agreeing to do this

Freds brow furrows

FRED
I didn’t agree to do anything

EDGAR
Then why are you here

FRED
(deadpan)
This is my house

Gilda looks at her watch steps toward Fred and takes the
keys from his hand

FRED (CONTD)
Excuse me

GILDA
(moving along)
Why don’t we go inside get Edgar
familiarized with the place
Gilda goes for the door followed by Edgar

GILDA (CONTD)

Freddy let’s get a move on before

your wife gets home

Fred remains there paralyzed a moment

INT TUTTLE RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER 20
Gilda walks into the foyer sniffs at the air grimaces
GILDA
(dry)
Well this isquaint

Edgar follows grins at what he sees as the simplicity of the
home

GILDA (CONTD)
A lot of beige

Gilda peers into the living room

GILDA (CONTD)
Living room over hereSomeone
likes Pottery Barn

Fred walks in

FRED
Excuse me

GILDA
What’s up Freddy

FRED
Stop calling me FreddyWhat the
hell is going on here

They both look to him

GILDA

(gesturing to Edgar)
Mr Eckmann here found me to find
you in the interest of swapping
with him for what we call and
what my prior clients who’ve done
this quite successfully have
called a week long trial period
Just a trial taste another life
for a little bit maybe even gain a
little perspective Some people are
happy swapping some people never
come back but we also have an
emergency clause if you were both
in agreement to want out you would
call me and end it No harm no
foul It’s kind of like a vacation
but no one realizes you’re gone

Fred dumbfounded can’t speak
GILDA (CONTD)
(looking at her watch)
Let’s take a look at the kitchen
INT THE TUTTLE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Gilda walks in followed by Fred and Edgar
GILDA
Yikes YellowDo you have any

Food allergies Fred
(MORE)

GILDA (CONTD)
Do you suffer from depression
Heartburn Sleep apnea Chronic
diarrhea Things that Edgar should
be aware of in case your wife
notices some disparity in behavior

FRED
Hold on a second

GILDA
We don’t have time for
deliberation Fred cause in about
five minutes your wife is gonna
pull into that driveway and this
moment will have been sucked off
into the netherworld of missed
opportunities and what ifs

Fred lets the comment resonateHe’s listening now
She pulls out contracts from her bag

FRED
How does it work though

GILDA
You trade all the pertinent
information about each other write
it down roll the dice and
improvise the rest I’m gonna keep
the Denver field office open for a
week then I have to head up to
Minneapolis for clients up there
There’s no direct contact permitted
between you during the specified
period but if by some chance
there’s a hitch you’ll have my
number

She hands him another card with the Roman numeral II on it a
number on the bottom - her name Gilda and cell number
scribbled on the back

Fred looks to Edgar who nods reassuringly

EDGAR
You only get one life to do
something completely irrational

GILDA
Come on Fred Where’s your sense
of spontaneity A week away from
the same old routine
FRED
How did you find me I mean

GILDA
Have you heard of facial
recognition software Social
networking sites Facebook
MySpace I can open a laptop and
pretty much find pictures of ten
guys you might get mistaken for

FRED
(to Edgar)
Why do you want to do this
A thoughtful beat
EDGAR
(evasive)
Why do you
Fred doesn’t answer Edgar gives him a faint smile
GILDA
(interrupting)
You both teach English
Fred perks up slightly

FRED
Where do you teach

EDGAR
Tulane University in New Orleans

Fred’s impressed but tries not to show it

FRED
Tenure

Gilda twirls her finger signaling to move things along

EDGAR
YepCreative writing

Fred nods perhaps a bit jealous

EDGAR (CONT ’D)

FRED
(slightly embarrassed)
Arapahoe High SchoolBrand name
American Lit Fitzgerald umyou
know the rest

EDGAR
(being kind)
Nice

FRED
You don’t have an accent

EDGAR
I’m from New York Moved when I got
the job at Tulane

Gilda looks at one of the documents in her hand

GILDA
Edgar also happens to be something
of a literary badass He won the
PenFaulker Award whatever that
is and was nominated for the
National Book Award before he was
stricken with a debilitating case
of writer’s block

Fred again perks up surprised

FRED
Youre a writer

EDGAR
(self-deprecating)
Not recently

GILDA
He’s kind of a deal down in New
Orleans You’d get to prance around
like a rock star
Fred thinks about this perhaps the trace of a smile
Gilda attempts to foster things along
GILDA (CONTD)
How long have you been married

Fred

Fred glances to her

FRED
Nine years eight months

GILDA
When’s the last time you got laid

FRED
(taken aback)
Is that relevant

GILDA
NomaybeI’m curious

FRED
That’s none of your business

EDGAR
(seeing Fred’s discomfort)
Well I live alonepretty
anonymously

FRED
No significant other

EDGAR
(a glint of sadness)
I dabble
A beat
FRED

I have a sonHe’s eight

GILDA
(interrupting)
And I know these are just words
but if I thought there was the hint
of a risk with that we wouldn’t be
hereEdgar’s trusting you with
his life too

Edgar procures a tattered Moleskine notebook from his
pocket and shows it to Fred

EDGAR
This is pretty much everything
youd need to know people places
numbers schedules directions

Fred doesn’t take the notebook

coat

GILDA
Come on Fred Don’t make this
another what if Take a break and
get a little perspective You
resent the hell out of your wife
you never get laid you barely
communicate “I got you your
Prilosec” “Um he’s in the tub”
It’s a cocktail for calamity If
you continue like this your
marriage is gonna disintegrate and
your poor kid will be the
collateral damage He’1ll hate your
guts and your wife will start
bagging some guy you called a
friend I know what I’m talking
about

Fred’s frozen by this

FRED
What are you How do you

Gilda puts the envelope of cash on the counter next to Fred

GILDA

(looks at her watch)
Look well be at Denver
International at nine am tomorrow
morning Ill be holding a plane
ticket to Louis Armstrong
International Airport for either
you or him

Fred just stares

GILDA (CONTD)
Sleep on it and if in the morning
you comprehend that this could be a
very good thing for you meet us at
United departures We’1ll trade
keys clothes etcetera and bring
a notebook of your people places
names etcetera for Edgar ‘kay

Fred nods as Edgar puts the notebook back in his pocket
Gilda grabs Edgar her things

GILDA (CONTD)
Nine am Fred

Then they run out and slam the front door behind them

Fred hears their cars turn onthen sees Bonnie’s car pull
in the driveway Gilda’s car peels off

Fred takes the envelope and puts it in the cookie jar on the
counter He hears Bonnie walk in the door

BONNIE (0S)
Who the heck was that

A beat
FRED

INT TUTTLE RESIDENCE FRED AND BONNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 22
Slight moaning
Fred stares at the ceiling in the dark
Bonnie’s asleep on her side of the bed She’s dreaming what
sounds like a sexy dream a slight moan here then a louder

one then a softer one

Fred peers uncomfortably over at her as she stirs She
continues in mumbles but doesn’t wakeso he taps her

FRED
Bon

She doesn’t stop doesn’t wake

Finally Fred sneaks out of bed and steps out into the
hallway

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 23

Fred walks quietly down the hall up to Ernie’s bedroom door
and peeks in

Soft light illuminates the room from a night-light Ernie
sleeps tangled in the comforter He’s sideways with his feet
hanging off the edge of the bed

Fred watches him a moment walks in and delicately picks
Ernie up places his head on the pillow and straightens him

He glances up to look around the room and notices the
permission slip he’d written for Ernie to go to Pluto

Ernie has tacked it onto a bulletin boardFred looks at it
a moment then he looks down at his sonHe kisses him on the
head and steps out of the room

He heads down the hall to a doorway opens it It leads down
to the basement

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 24

Fred turns on a light exposing piles of boxes and other
stored unused crap

He walks up to a desk next to which there is a framed
certificate on the wall that reads Fred Tuttle - Arapahoe
County Teacher of the Year 2003

Some books Joyce’s “The Dead” Dickens and THE DOUBLE line
the desk along with an old sappy photo of Fred and Bonnie in
their twenties she wears a Denver University sweatshirt
their faces nestled close

Fred plops himself down at the desk and remains there a
moment thinking

Then the basement door opens

And Bonnie walks down the creaky wood steps Her hair’s a bit
rumpled from bed Fred turns to see her - she looks beautiful
in that sleepy disheveled way She walks around him then
sits on his lap facing him

Fred reacts with a grunt to her weight on his legs

BONNIE
Am I that heavy

Fred grins warmly up at her and shakes his head “no”

They observe each other lovingly Bonnie smooths his brow
and brushes her hands through his hair

Fred closes his eyes as she does this relishing it then
opens them to look at her again

BONNIE (CONT’D)
I love you

A sad smile emerges on Fred’s face as if he hadn’t heard that
in a while

BONNIE (CONT’D)
(gently)
I know you’re in there somewhere
(MORE )

BONNIE (CONT’D)
So I was wondering if you could let
me know where I can find the Fred I
fell so ridiculously in love with

Fred looks at her still somber thinking about it himself
And then she’s goneFred imagined it

After a few seconds he reaches for a pen and a black
notebookHe opens the notebook and decidedly begins to
write things down

cell-phones wallets house and car keys on the bathroom sink
between them They stand in front of adjacent sinks and
mirrorsFred reaches into his wallet and pulls out a badly
posed portrait photo of him Bonnie and Ernie to take with
him

FRED
Have you ever felt like you’ve lost
some crucial part of yourself
you’re not sure what part but if
you don’t somehow get it back you
won’t really be living your life
youll be living off to the side of
itor something

Edgar surveys him Fred gets uncomfortable
FRED (CONTD)

disheveled hair

in Fred’s They’re both clean shaven and sport a similar
close cropped haircut

his expression

with books and papers Fred notices what looks like a balance
sheet He reaches for it and his eyes pop at the 833120
balance He puts it down and notices an invitation to A Night
On The Delta Presenting the Louisiana Writer Award to Edgar
and then the typewriter at the head of the table Fred looks
at the typewriter and the empty sheet in it

He surveys the table then notices the photo of the woman
looking off on a nearby shelf

He reaches into the plastic bag pulls out one of Bonnie’s
Scent-Sations candles and places it on the table Then he
hears a knock at the door

He turns startled peers at the door

Another hard knock almost an angry knock

Fred recedes from the door worried
She kicks it again
FRED
(weakly)

Who is it

He looks panicked then opens Edgar’s notebook He opens it to
a scribble of names no indication of who this would be

FRED
Umno I don’t

She kicks it againthen it’s quiet for a second

Until she busts her way through the door loses her balance
and crumbles to the floor

ALICE ASHBERY whom we glimpsed in the first scene with
Edgar 25 a dark emotional wreck of a beautiful young
woman not the woman in the photo Julie Christie meets Patti

up and walks over to him in the living room

He falls backwards onto the floor
ALICE

past couple days

She moves quickly kneels down and straddles him as he lays
there and lets out a groan

He reaches for his face in pain

She grabs him by the lapels angrily and pulls him up into a
fierce kiss

Then pushes him back against the base of a couch looks at
him slaps him looks at him another moment then kisses him
some more

Fred has no clue what’s hit him as she attacks him on the
ground He can barely breath

She pulls away from him again and looks him in the eye

expression

arbitrarilythen begins to read

FRED (CONTD)
The kiss had breathed the life back
into him For the moment he ceased
to fear death or so to say
perceive it He was hoping(Fred
stops a moment prudish worried
about the page he’s chosen) He was
hoping she was eighteen (Fred
can’t go back now unsure what’s
going to unfold) And now she lay
there on the bed stripped barely
registering his drunken touch as
his hand traversedup the
geography of her inner
thigh(Fred uncomfortably clears
his throat) into the stubbly
scratch of her pubic hair (Fred
lets out an uncomfortable breath
pauses at seeing what’s next but
reads onward)Her pussy tasted
like papaya

Fred fuzzy from the weed wet from the beer steps from the
passenger seat of the BMW parked next to Marianne’s beat up
motorcycle as PEDESTRIANS walk by and notices them looking a
a line of horse drawn carriages

ALICE
Poor God damned horses They look
so depressed

ALICE
Pull your skirt up and let’s go
Marianne

Marianne goes to distract the first CARRIAGE DRIVER as Alice
goes around the first carriage releases the horse and gives
it a slap on the ass It starts to wander down French Street

Some PEDESTRIANS notice puzzled

Then the CARRIAGE DRIVERS notice and panicked run after it
leaving the other three parked carriages abandoned

ALICE (CONTD)
Your turn

She grabs Fred and pulls him toward the next horse
ALICE (CONTD)
You take the this one Hop on and

I’ll release him

FRED
No waitWhat

ALICE
Get on

FRED

ALICE
Yes

FRED

What about you

ALICE

She pushes him up to the horse and gives him a boost as Fred
climbs clumsily onto it

FRED
This isthis is not a good idea

She slides the blinders off the horses eyes and goes to
release the horse from the carriage

Fred looks down at the horse

FRED (CONT’D)
Hello

The horse snorts oblivious

Fred looks out at the surrounding street tentative but kind
of pleased with himself and not sure what to do next

FRED (CONT’D)
What now

The carriage drivers have wrangled the other horse down the
street and notice Fred on the horse

CARRIAGE DRIVER
(noticing from off)
Hey What the hell are you
doing

As Alice and the others try to mount the horses behind
Fred’s horse spooks whinnies and goes up on it’s hind legs
then takes off like a shot down Bourbon Street

Fred gets thrown back off the saddle and tossed around like a
rag doll but manages to hold on for dear life to the reigns
as the freaked out horse hurdles down the street past
CONFUSED PEDESTRIANS and TWO STREET COPS who watch him go

by

FRED
Shiiit

White knuckling a little drunk and still high he pulls his
way up onto the saddle as the horse continues to run for its
life He slides down to the side of the saddle and tries to

correct himself then finally gets upright although still at
the mercy of the terrified horse

FRED (CONT’D)
HeySlowwoah

The horse ignores him and keeps running through an
intersection a red-light camera flares

Fred turns to look back - Alice and the rest are nowhere in
sight

And that’s when sirens can be heard He looks to the left and
notices cop cars with lights flashing driving on a parallel
street to Bourbon

SOME JAZZ MUSICIANS watch and smirk at Fred flailing on the
horse and for a moment Fred shares a look with them as he
rides through the BEWILDERED SCATTERED PEDESTRIANS PATRONS
and TOURISTS

But then Fred’s horse decides to turn down a side street away
from A CROWD OF PEOPLE GATHERED AHEAD in the middle of
Bourbon The horse runs onto Rampart Street and ahead into
St Louis Cemetery No 1 - It gallops through the aisles of
above ground graves and Fred watches it all pass by Fred
takes the reigns of the rogue horse and actually recovers his
equilibrium to ride with the it through the rest of the
cemetery until they emerge out onto a busy street along side
some cars whose DRIVERS notice him with puzzled expressions

Two police cruisers race into an intersection ahead of him
skid to a halt blocking his path

The horse startles and stops short hurling Fred from the
saddle off and onto the ground with a loud thud

Fred lies there stunned and in pain as the horse walks
around confused as to what the hell just happened

FRED (CONT’D)
(delayed)
Ow

TWO OF NEW ORLEANS FINEST walk up and look down at Fred
splayed there

POLICE OFFICER
What the hell are you doing

FRED
(half-heartedly pained)
Liberating the horses

She doesn’t acknowledge him as she throws her jacket on
takes a hit of coffee

Edgar watches herthen proceeds to the Mr Coffee on the
counter grabs a mug from a rack by the sink pours himself a
cup sips scowls at the taste then continues to study
her

She grabs her keys and heads toward the front door

She stops and turns

BONNIE

EDGAR

BONNIE
(confused)
Good morning

She contemplates him a moment then heads for the door

He watches her out the window running to her car and pulling
out of the driveway

and finds the number for Arapahoe High School He dials the
number into Fred’s cell phoneit rings

Scent-Sations materials on the desk

scruffy and disheveled

A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY lies fetal next to him his head

She looks ahead an incredulous grin in her expression

ALICE
How about you commit to something

She screeches up to a curb in front of the Tulane campus

ALICE (CONTD)
I’m so tired of orbiting around

nostalgic bullshit It’s
exhaustingDo you want a donut or

FRED
If you’re so exhausted why don’t

She’s stung They sit there for a beat

She realizes it is

Fred’s on Edgar’s cell-phone making a call as he walks
through campus he looks at Gilda’s card in his hands
INT TOO INC OFFICES - SAME TIME

RECEPTIONIST

Good morning Too Inc How can I
direct your call

It looks like a production office nice but not too sleek
VARIOUS EMPLOYEES shuffle about with photos and paper A huge
bulletin board with photo matches of PEOPLE’S FACES is in the
background A projector’s on in a conference room in the
background - the pictures of two similar looking women
projected next to each other on a screen as A FEW OPERATIVES
seem to be looking at them and discussing

INTERCUT WITH FRED

FRED
(a bit confused)
Hi yes may I speak with Gilda

glances up at the expanse of the Norman Mayer building and
walks up and in

EXT CHERRY HILLS VILLAGE LITTLETON - THE SAME MORNING 51

It’s chilly Edgar freshly showered and shaved walks down
the main drag in Cherry Hills enjoying the small town charm
he holds a cup of coffee a shopping bag a newspaper and
heads toward Fred’s car

A sixty-something man GERRY silver haired sits on the hood
of Freds Camry He looks up at Edgar and smiles

GERRY
Fredly

Edgar glances to him with a “who the hell is this” type
expression then out of caution moves toward friendliness

EDGAR
Heya

GERRY
It’s been a bit

EDGAR
Yeah it hassince since

GERRY
Bonnie’s birthday I think

EDGAR
Yepthat was fun

It probably wasn’t as Gerry gives him a dry grin
GERRY
Well since we’re here you got
time for a coffee
Fred looks to the coffee in his hands
EDGAR

(unsure)
Sure

Fred doesn’t respond still not used to being Edgar

LEE (CONTD)
(harder)
Edgar

Fred turns to see an elegant fifty-something man in a suit
and tie LEE MELLON the President of the University He
wears a rather concerned expression

LEE (CONTD)
Can I speak with you in my office

Fred furrows his brow

INT STARBUCKS - MINUTES LATER 53

Edgar sits with Gerry on the verge of a lecture at a table
in front of their grande drips

GERRY
Nancy was on the phone with Bonnie
the other dayBonnie had a good
cryAny idea what that’s about

Edgar wears a blank expression as the cashier calls out an
order in the background

EDGAR
To be honest no

GERRY
Look I have no interest in prying
I know you think I’m a putz and to
be fair I always took you for one
too

Edgar squints at this

GERRY (CONTD)
Aside from the whole holiday song
and dance we don’t get a lot of
face time so I’m not sure what’s
going on over there

EDGAR
That makes two of us

GERRY
Don’t get cute

Gerry studies Edgar

GERRY (CONT’D)
You’ve changed

EDGAR
Isn’t that inevitable

GERRY
Sure but you got quiet Real
quietYou’re disappearing
FredShe used to wear you like a
badge Wouldn’t shut up about how
smart you were how you were gonna
help change the public school
system save the world and all that
crap It was annoying but Id
rather have that than hear she’s
crying instead

Edgar absorbs this thinks about it a second

EDGAR
Well what do you prescribe

GERRY
Huh

EDGAR
(improvising)
I justI’m not sure I know what
to do oror how exactly to handle
this

GERRY
Nobody knows how to handle
thisLife It’s a weird word

EDGAR
I guess

After a few seconds

GERRY
Every once in a while Nancy and I
inch away into our separate spaces
Happened after we were first
married and things weren’t quite
what we expected and again after
Bonnie left for DUWe were stuck
in that house unable to look at or
touch each other

A thoughtful moment the hubbub of Starbucks around them

GERRY (CONTD)
How’s Bonnie in the sack

EDGAR
(surprised)
Excuse me
GERRY
I bet she’s an ice queen like her
mother

Edgar confused doesn’t know what to say

GERRY (CONTD)
You ever think about screwing
around

EDGAR
(not sure what to say)
No

GERRY
Why not I cheat on Nancy every now
and again to keep things
interesting

Edgar squints questionably at him

EDGAR
How’s that working out for you

GERRY
Fine Maybe it’s time you screw
around a little

Edgar remains squinting not getting his logic

EDGAR
Does umNancy know you screw
around

GERRY

She’s never mentioned anything to
meAll a man has is his sense of
self Fred We pummel ourselves
with expectations and wind up lost
for wordsSometimes it takes an
act of idiocy to remember who you
were and realize what you wanted
was just across the room from you

Edgar looks down into his coffee

EDGAR
A bit preachy no

GERRY
Don’t be a schmuck I’m not one for
being earnest but she loves you
(MORE )

GERRY (CONTD)
Behind whatever static snuck in
between you two that girl loves
you

Edgar begins to see what marriage he’s walked intoThen he
double takes as he notices Gilda sitting at a nearby table
with a Denver Post sipping a coffee She meets his eyes
gives him a wink goes back to her paper

INT PRESIDENT MELLON’S OFFICE - A BIT LATER 54

Close on a photograph of Fred on the horse in an intersection
caught by a Red-light camera It’s definitely him except he
wears a surprised expressionhe looks ridiculous

Fred horrified looks at the photo as he sits in front of
President Mellons deskHe leans forward places the photo
on the desk and sits back

President Mellon leans on his desk chair

FRED
Sir listen

LEE
(interrupting)
Call me Lee for Christs sake

Lee looks at the photo again

LEE (CONTD)
What the hell were you thinking

Eckmann

FRED
I don’t think I wasthinkingI
just

LEE

This is no smallI mean for a
professor to go to jail is no small
thing for this university It’s a
deal a big deal

FRED
Yeah I get that

Lee studies him

LEE
Since we’re being frank I have to
say I’ve had some concernI want
to be lenient hereBut you’re not
writing you haven’t published in
years I’m not sure you’re even
teaching or what you’re teaching
for that matterYou were the
bright young thing in the English
department Edgar tenure at your
age the Awards stuff the kids
love youOn paper you look
pretty stellar

Fred searches for a way out of this

FRED
Well I don’t live on paper

LEE
I know it hasn’t been an easy year

Fred looks up at him wondering what that means for Edgar

FRED
I suppose so

LEE
My brother lost his wife and it
threw him out of the stratosphere

Fred’s surprised at the information

LEE (CONTD)
Look I don’t want to get
historical on you

Lee grabs the photo from the Red-light camera looks at it

LEE (CONTD)
But have you lost your mind

And Fred his back against the wall starts talking as Fred

FRED
(a bit heated)
No Yes NoLook I decided to
have a little fun Is that a crime
I mean when did fun become a
crime

LEE
Um when you do stupid shit like
thisagain I can’t have the
Times-Picayune getting a hold of
this

Fred sees his point takes a breath then

FRED
Listen II haven’t been myself
lately and as you said it’s been
a shit year I’m tired of myself
I’m tired of my shitI just
decided to do something stupid

LEE
Stupid is the right word but do me
a favor and go jump out a plane or
do the thing with the cord off the
bridge take a pill take a
sabbatical just don’t get caught
like some nut-job pseudo-radical
who flew off the left wing so the
trustees come down on my ass

Fred sits with that for a moment realizing he can’t change
who he is then

FRED
LeeYou can’t take the spots off
the leopard You hired me cause I’m
me sotake it or leave it

A beat
LEE
You’1l have to do some community
service
FRED
Fine

Edgar waits a second shakes his head and pulls a new coffee
maker out of the shopping bag

BONNIE
UmPrincipal Kessler called to

Edgar takes the coffee maker out of the box and replaces the
old one on the counter Bonnie doesn’t notice

EDGAR
(grimacing)

Edgar wonders who “everyone” is

EDGAR
Okaywhere’s Ernie

Umit’s at the umCheesecake
Factory

Edgar again confused by her response or attention deficit
looks at her

EDGAR
Bonnie
BONNIE

Edgar reaches to the inside of his coat and pulls out a
single burgundy rose places it next to her keyboard then
retreats out of the kitchen

Bonnie continues typing for a few seconds then stops notices
it and turns looking for Fred sees he’s gone

expression goes blank

INT ERNIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 57
Edgar walks into the room and peers around at Ernie’s
cornucopia of toys books crayons but no Ernie in sight
EDGAR
Ernie

The window’s open - cold air and a few snow flurries draught
in and Edgar goes over to close itAfter he does he looks
back at the room still clutching the MandMs in his hand

EDGAR (CONTD)
Ernie

He thinks a moment then realizesHe turns back and re-
opens the window He peers out and notices a ladder just
outside leading from the back lawn up to the roof just above
the bedroom

Edgar eases his way out the window and then climbs up the
ladder to the roof and looks around

EDGAR (CONTD)
Ernie

ERNIE (0S)
Yup

Edgar follows the voice up the slick roof which isn’t very
steep and finds Ernie in a puffy parka moon boots over his
pajamas He’s lying on his back in between the eaves staring
up into the snow flurries He has a flashlight a note-pad a
red crayon and a juice box

ERNIE (CONTD)
First snowfall

Edgar carefully makes his way over and lies down next to him
EDGAR
(slightly out of breath)
YeahLove when that happens

Ernie shines the flashlight upwards the flakes descending
from the darkness above onto them

Something’s bothering Ernie but he says nothing

EDGAR (CONTD)
How was your Monday

ERNIE
(matter of fact)
It was a MondayCan you look over

Ernie passes Edgar a piece of paper with red crayon scribbles
on it

EDGAR (CONT ’D)

Ernie waves his flashlight at him giving him his answer
They both quietly look up at the sky for a moment

ERNIE
Moms been crying

Edgar looks over at Ernie

EDGAR
What do you mean

ERNIE
I mean she’s been crying

EDGAR
Did she say why

Ernie looks to him a weight in his expression

ERNIE
WellI heard her on the phone
with Granny the other day When she
saw that I saw her she said she
caught a cold but she didn’t
I don’t think I’1l ever get
married

EDGAR
Why’s that

ERNIE
Too much pressuretoo

Edgar can’t disagree

EDGAR
Yeah it’s complicatedSometimes
people don’t realize how good

After a thoughtful beat

EDGAR
I was supposed to do a lot of
things

ERNIE

Did you want more than this

EDGAR
Sure

ERNIE
Yeahmom did too

They both stare up into the snowflakes for another moment
then attempting to move on and cheer Ernie up he holds up
the pack of MandMs somewhat proudly as if he’d done a good
deed

EDGAR
I brought you these

Ernie glances at it then at Edgar turns off the
flashlightHe takes the bag of MandMs and puts it on his lap

ERNIE
(a little confused)

After a moment

ERNIE (CONTD)

Edgar turns surprised but catches himself and pretends not
to be

EDGAR
What uhwhat are you talking

EDGAR

Ernie smiles amused

ERNIE
You sound like Darth Vader

EDGAR

Edgar looks over at him worried surprised

ERNIE

(continuing)
It’s really not that big a
dealMy parents both seem to be
living on a different planet
anywayI just happen to be paying
attention and a citizen of planet
Earth

He looks at Edgar

ERNIE (CONTD)
No way you’re my dad

Edgar bunches his expression up in a mix of frustration
irritation and confusion

EDGAR
I umI’m confused

ERNIE

confusedSo is he coming back

EDGAR

ERNIE

ERNIE (CONTD)
(more emotional)

Fred hangs up He scans the scattered papers the invitation
on the tableHe reaches for Edgar’s book and looks at the
cover “How You Will Know Me” by Edgar Eckmann National Book
Award Finalist 2001 He opens it and notices the dedication
For Sophie

He turns and looks around curious then gets up and walks
over to peer in the kitchen scattered dishes Pop Tarts and
Folgers on the counter-top He continues down the hall
notices a bathroom ahead and then a doorway to the right He
opens the door and peers in

INT STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 59

Fred flips on the lightIt’s musty as if it hadn’t been
opened in a while and it’s filled with a clothing rack of
women’s clothing hanging like ghosts There’s a box of shoes
storage boxes his and her bicycles a pile of documents and
clippings Fred steps in and peruses them He notices some
photos - one of Edgar with Bill Clinton He picks it up
studies it amusedthen pockets it

INT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY - A BIT LATER THAT EVENING 60

ETHAN (0S)
I can see your point but I
still think you’re full of shit

Edgar sits over a grilled cheese still disturbed by Ernie’s
discovery and dazed by the divergent conversations from
Maile Ethan Jan Tom and Bonnie sitting around him none of
whom seem to have noticed any difference between him and
Fred

TOM (0S)
I didn’t think you needed that much
horsepower

ETHAN (0S)
I don’t know a contractor in town
who has less than three hundred
under his hood

Jan Maile and Bonnie have their separate conversation

JAN
and she tells Oprah it’s leading
a comfortable life in your
community your neighborhood
whatever and believing in the same
things as the people you’re
surrounded by

MATLE
(interrupting)
Or at least pretending you do

She and Jan share a snicker at this

JAN
Exactly

Bonnie gives a gratuitous smile to Maile and Jan

Jan’s snicker fades into something more serious she takes a
bite of her Chicken Caesar salad

TOM
(being the Ford salesman)
I liked the F150 for you I
didn’t think it’d be a lemon

ETHAN
Well life shouldn’t be giving me
lemons it should be asking what
kind of fruit I want

Edgar sits there in his own private Idaho He reaches for THE
WAITRESS as she scurries by

WAITRESS
Whatcha need hon

EDGAR
A Jameson and rocks would be a
decent start

WAITRESS
Back in a sec

Bonnie peers over at him Fred never drinks

Restless Edgar looks down reaches into his coat pocket He
brought Ernie’s panda report with him and starts to read it
on his lap

Ethan notices him looking down at Ernie’s report

ETHAN
(still chewing food)
Hey Mr Congeniality whatcha
doing over yonder

EDGAR
Huh

Ethan uses fake sign language

ETHAN
What are you looking at

EDGAR
It’s uhErnie’s panda report He
asked me to proof it for him

ETHAN
(slightly admonishing)
At the dinner table

Edgar squints at him but let’s it go

MATLE
Oh please read it

JAN
Cute Read it

Bonnie shoots a look to Edgar

EDGAR
(shrugs )
Okay

Ethan shakes his head

EDGAR (CONTD)

(reading)
UhhPanda bears are solitary
animals They mate once in a year
Only once There is no such thing
as a lasting male-female bond in
their world A male panda and a
female panda meet by accident
somewhere in their big huge bamboo
forest and they mate Then when
they finish the male runs away
from the female as if he is scared
to death and never looks back The
rest of the year he lives alone
somewhere deep in the forest
Mutual communication does not exist
for them And that is the story of
panda bears

Edgar almost moved then looks up at Bonnie who seems a bit
self-conscious

ETHAN
(snide)
Wellthat was mind-blowing

MATLE
Quiet

The waitress returns with Edgar’s scotch Edgar takes a good
sip

With that Ethan reaches his fork into Bonnie’s Penne with
Marinara sauce

Edgar glances up and notices this
Bonnie notices him notice

EDGAR
What are you doing

Ethan stops about to put the bite in his mouth

EDGAR (CONTD)
Did you ask if you could have a
bite of that

ETHAN
Um

EDGAR
Bonnie is it okay with you if this
asshole takes a bite off your
plate

Everyone looks to Bonnie uncomfortable

BONNIE
UmNo actually
EDGAR
(to Ethan)

So put it down

ETHAN
Are you kidding me

EDGAR
Put the god damned penne down

He puts it down on his plate

Edgar takes another sip as the rest of the table sits there
frozen

Bonnie looks into her food

ETHAN
Who brought the tough guy

JAN
Apparently Bonnie did
EDGAR
I’m not sure what your problem is
but I’1l bet it’s hard to
pronounce

Bonnie looks surprised to Edgar

ETHAN
What my problem is

MATLE
(trying to settle him)
Ethan

Ethan hardens used to running the show here

ETHAN
When’d you decide to grow a
personality

MATLE
Don’t be rude

ETHAN
I’m not being rude He’s just
insignificant

BONNIE
(upset by the comment)
Knock it off

ETHAN
(dry)
Sorry just having trouble seeing
your husband with an actual
presence

EDGAR
Maybe if you paid less attention to
jerking off your ego your eyesight
might improve

Bonnie lets out a snicker then smothers it
Ethan stands up

EDGAR (CONTD)
Sit down

MATLE
(worried)
Ethan

ETHAN
Get up you pansy

EDGAR
Really

Ethan awkwardly pushes Edgar in the head with his hand
Edgar looks up at him for a good couple secondsthen
springs up and pummels him into the adjacent table knocking
it whatever was on it and a few of the people at it to the
floor in a loud clatter of plates and glasses

Bonnie stares dumbfounded at her supposed husband

INT EDGAR ECKMANN’S HOUSE - AROUND THE SAME TIME 61

Fred sits on the floor looking through Edgar’s various
clippings

He notices some newspaper clippings - an obituary for Sophie
Eckmann Associate Professor of English and Comparative
Literature Tulane University wife of Edgar Eckmann dated a
year and a half ago with a photo on the upper left hand
corner the same woman in the photo on Edgar’s table

Fred stares at the photo a stern expression on his face

EXT PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER 62

Edgar covered in food stains and Bonnie trudge up to the
Civic in the snowfall Bonnie goes for the passenger door

EDGAR
Can you drive please

Bonnie looks at him

He forgets to open the car door for her and hops in the
passenger side

She walks around to the driver’s side annoyed that again he
neglected to open the door for her She wipes the snow off
the windshield then gets in the car

They sit there for a moment

BONNIE
What the hell was that

EDGAR
What was what

BONNIE
(pointing toward the
restaurant)
That

EDGAR
(changing the subject)
Ernie said you were crying the
other day

BONNIE
What No Don’t change the
subject What’s going on with you

EDGAR
Why were you crying

BONNIE
(defensive)
I wasn’t

Edgar looks to her calling her out

BONNIE (CONT’D)

(folding)
So
EDGAR
And
BONNIE
And what
EDGAR
Why were you crying
BONNIE
Isn’t a person allowed to feel

something

The windows start to fog from their heat against the outside
cold

EDGAR
Sure Feel all you wantjust make
sure what you’re feeling’s right

She glares at him something’s different something’s off
BONNIE
What the hell’s that supposed to
mean

EDGAR

It means I don’t think you’re as
happy as you should be

BONNIE
What’s going on with you

A quiet couple seconds
EDGAR

(changing the subject)
What exactly happened to us

BONNIE
(deferring)
Fred
EDGAR
You shouldn’t dust this stuff under
the rug
BONNIE
(harder)
Fred
EDGAR

I’m not saying we have to discuss
it right now but at some point you
should probably get around to it

BONNIE
What the hell is there to say

EDGAR
WeThis marriage is stale Time
does this awful thing of moving on

Bonnie looks hard at him
EDGAR (CONTD)
(trying another tack)

What’s our song

BONNIE
Huh

EDGAR
Our song

She’s confused for a second until a faint smile from some
memory creeps its way into her expression

BONNIE
Hootie and the Blowfish

Edgar smothers a scowl

BONNIE (CONT’D)
I only wanna be with you”

EDGAR
Was that a smile

BONNIE
No

EDGAR

Do you have any idea how good this
life is that kid that house
You haven’t the faintest do you

BONNIE
(hurt)
What about you Fred I haven’t
seen you hosting any parades
lately

A thoughtful beat

EDGAR
Youre rightSame goes for me

They sit there in a long uncomfortable silence Bonnie
stares out the windshield Edgar turns and looks over at
her

BONNIE
(ruffled)
What

He leans in and kisses her the perfect kiss the tension
breaker of all tension breakers

Edgar squeezes her close and breathes the life back into her
her guard dropping off like a silk slip

He moves across the parking break and things escalate as he
clumsily adjusts her seat back She straddles him they kiss
harder clothes start to come off and they push further
toward sex

But then Bonnie comes back to Earth She opens her eyes mid-
kiss has some sort of realization something is different
about this kiss something is off with this guy whom she
thinks is FredShe breaks the kiss and pushes Edgar off of
her backs away from him

EDGAR
What

She stares at him shocked as if he were a strangerthen
catches her breath composes herself

After a few seconds Edgar moves back into the driver’s seat
unsure The moment broken

She squints at him something sad behind her expression then
looks out the windshield again

BONNIE
Let’s go home

INT EDGAR’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING 63

Fred wakes having slept slumped on the couch neck stiff
hungover stubble longer Edgar’s book nestled between him
and the couch arm an empty bottle of Booker’s on the floor

He notices the window’s open French Quarter street noise
seeping in curtains taken by a breeze which hits him He
faintly smiles Slowly he realizes that Alice rests on his
chestthen sits up with a start

FRED
What are you doing here
ALICE

FRED

How did you get in here

ALICE
The window

Fred notices his pants are at his ankles
FRED

WaitDid we Did you What
happened last night

ALICE
(toying)
What do you remember happening last
night

Fred with his bedraggled hair thinks hard about it as Alice
sits up

He can’t help but look at her her black tank top has bundled
up revealing a life-sized Colt 45 tattoo on her right hip
looking like it’s holstered in her panties’ waste-line

She positions herself on Fred’s lap straddling him She runs
her hand through his hair smiles softly

ALICE (CONTD)
Where are you Eckmann

Fred clenches

FRED
What happened last night

ALICE

(dry)

She kisses him on the forehead gets up and walks off down
the hallway

ALICE (0S)

The shower turns on

FRED
(to himself)
Oh my God

ALICE (0S)
Don’t forget we’ve gotta be ready
at five for the presentation

FRED
(to himself)
Presentation dinner

He peers down the hall making sure Alice doesn’t see him
then takes out Edgar’s phone dials his own numberit goes
straight to voice-mail

FRED (0S) (CONTD)

straight to voice-mail

Fred hangs up sits there brimming with anxiety thinking of
what the hell to do how to get out of this He looks at his

phone makes a decision takes a breath and dials

INT FRED AND BONNIE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 64

The phone in the bedroom rings

Someone’s in the shower in the background

And Bonnie picks up

BONNIE
Hello

INTERCUT BETWEEN EDGAR’S HOUSE AND FRED AND BONNIES HOUSE
Fred freezes a moment hearing the familiar warmth of
Bonnie’s voice

FRED
(into the phone)

Bonnie looks confused a strange sense of recognition

BONNIE

FRED
(cupping the phone
altering his voice)
Umthis isis Fred there

Bonnie looks to the bathroom
BONNIE
(confused)

65 INT FRED AND BONNIE’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

Bonnie puzzled puts the phone down She looks toward the

bathroom as Edgar scrubs behind the shower curtain

She looks toward his pile of clothes on the ground and

notices a lighter sticking out of his pocket She squints
suspiciously and walks over to the pile of clothes kneels

down to examine the lighter then goes through Edgar’s
pockets

She finds Fred’s keys some crumpled cash and change She
smells something she sniffs his shirt grimaces at the smoky
smell

ERNIE (0S)
Bus’s here Bye mom

She’s startled

BONNIE
(off)
Okay Bye sweetie

EDGAR
(from the shower)

BONNIE
Nothing Just

She quickly turns back to the task at hand and hits the
jacket pockets She finds a pen some receipts and then
Gilda’s business card with the roman numeral II on it and the
Hyatt address written on the back

Bonnie surveys it suspiciously as the shower turns off She
pockets the card and walks out of the room

INT EDGAR’S LIVING ROOM - A COUPLE MINUTES LATER 66
Fred stares freaked out into nothing
Alice steps down the hallway in a towel

ALICE
Who were you talking to

FRED
Nobody

ALICE
I heard you talking to someone

FRED
(flustered)
To myself I was talking to

FRED
(fed up)
Alice

ALICE
You pussyEvery minute of this is
a minute out of my life

FRED
Mine too

ALICE
You’ll miss me asshole You’1l
really miss me

FRED
(losing his grip)
How the hell can you miss somebody
if they won’t leave you alone

ALICE
(hurt)
It was a mistake to label this
love It was more like empathy

She tries to smother any emotion

ALICE (CONTD)
I came over here to be with you
last night cause the loneliness
knocked the wind out of me That
was the deal when we started all
this You were alone I was alone
It was like Last Tango in Paris
without the butter but apparently
you’re a walking living breathing
contradiction

FRED
Maybe

ALICE
Fuck maybe

FRED

(harder)
No don’t fuck maybe Life is based
on maybeYou say your wedding
vows and you think maybe youyou
commit to anything but you think
maybe We’re all floating on maybe
in a big fat ocean of
contradictions so

A beat

ALICE
First of all you sound retarded
secondly you’re mixing metaphors
and thirdly that’s bullshitYou
can think “maybe” all you want but
at the end of the day we’re all
living in the real world We all
know everything’s bullshit but we
also all have some sort of clue
what we’re doing and what we should
be doing so suck it up

FRED
You know nothing about
meNothing Maybe I’m going
through some shit right now Maybe
I’m having a moment You have no
idea who I am just like I can’t
begin to assume who you are
underneath all yourshit

FRED (CONT’D)
How old are you

ALICE
(a bit confused)
You know I’m twenty-five

He studies her

FRED
Age will turn you into someone you
don’t know yet It will turn the
person you love into someone you
don’t know yet

ALICE
What are you talking about

FRED
I knew this girl She was erratic
pathologically spontaneous smart
gorgeous Like you She had this
idea of what her life would be She
was gonna get her pilot’s license
ride the Orient Express write one
of those travel columns for the
paper

(MORE )

FRED (CONTD)
Bit by bit she had to make other
choices her dreams became more
modest fizzled into compromises
etcetera etcetera All for some
putz Don’t do that

ALICE
So where does that leave us

FRED
I don’t knowI just miss my wife

ALICE
I know you do
EXT HYATT REGENCY DENVER - A BIT LATER 67
Bonnie holds the card with the Roman numeral II on it She
walks through the melting snow up to the Best Western hotel
INT HYATT REGENCY - MOMENTS LATER 68

Bonnie steps down the hall looking for room 202When she
reaches it she hesitates a moment then knocks on the door

BONNIE
Hello

Nothing

She knocks againthen tries the door knob the door’s
actually open the latch keeping it so She peers in then
flips the light switch revealing the room the Starbuck’s
cups folders note-pads a laptop and printerfax on the
table by the window

She shakes her head at her seemingly trivial investigation of
all this wondering what the hell she’s doing there

She’s about to turn away when she notices something on the
desk - a picture of Fred peeking out of one of the note-pads

She picks it up pulls out the photo then opens the note-
pad On the front page it reads In case of loss please
return to Gilda Munro 917-226-0669 She turns the pages and
sees some names numbers and then she comes across Fred’s
name and the address for Arapahoe High School their home
address then her name

BONNIE (CONT’D)
(confused to herself)
What the

She hears someone coming down the hall

GILDA (0S)

Yeah I’1ll tell you exactly when
that happened nineteen eighty
neverOh bullshit that was a
one time thing and how the hell was
I supposed to know he was under
investigation

Gilda walks into the room while having an animated
conversation into her Bluetooth head-set She carries another
Starbuck’s frappuccino doesn’t notice Bonnie and goes
straight into the bathroom leaving the door open

Bonnie freezes listening to her go to the bathroom

GILDA (0S) (CONT’D)
You tried to swap a plastic surgeon
with a Mennonite dairy farmer that
doesn’t even qualify to be
retarded It’s too stupid to be
retardedWell I’m not the one
pretending this is an exact
scienceNo I’ve grown out of
talking like I know something when
I don’t

She flushes the toilet comes out of the bathroom sees
Bonnie thinks nothing of itthen double takes notices the
note-pad in Bonnie’s hand She stares at her in shock

GILDA (CONTD)
Ho-ly shitbombs

She goes back to her call
GILDA (CONTD)
(into the earpiece)
What No no I uh something

She ends the call gives Bonnie a gratuitous smile

Bonnie gives her a once over then holds up the note-pad

BONNIE
(no nonsense)
Gilda
GILDA

They stare each other down

BONNIE
What the hell is going on

GILDA
(improvising)
Pleasure’s all mine

BONNIE
(harder)
What is this

Gilda says nothing trying to figure out how to deal with
this

BONNIE (CONT’D)

address Why is my family in

Gilda still doesn’t respond

BONNIE (CONTD)
(pushing)

BONNIE
(a bit thrown by her
reaction)
Okayso Are you sleeping with

She snickers again then stops abruptly

GILDA (CONTD)

Bonnie stares daggers at her
GILDA (CONTD)

BONNIE
(hardening)
Not until you tell me what the
hell’s going on

A beat

GILDA

GILDA
Hold on
BONNIE
(baffled)

Excuse me
Gilda ignores her waits for someone to answer
GILDA

computerTurn on your
computerWe’ve got a code pink

Gilda walks over to her laptop at the table and opens it up
then clicks into Skype

GILDA (CONTD)

Bonnie walks over cautiously and stands behind Gilda

Gilda clicks open a window and A WOMAN who looks a whole lot
like Gilda appears except she’s fair haired more make-up

GILDA (CONTD)
This is my associate Gerty

Bonnie looks at the woman on the screen

GERTY
Can you see me

GILDA
Yes she can see you

Gilda looks to Bonnie as if this explains everything

BONNIE
(shrugs )
And

GILDA
I don’t have a twin

Again Gilda believes this will explain everything
Bonnie thinks about it

GILDA (CONTD)

I was born in San Francisco
California Gerty was born in
Cincinnati OhioFred Tuttle was
born in Littleton Colorado
resides in Denver

Gilda picks and holds up a photograph of Fred then she picks
up a photograph of Edgar

GILDA (CONTD)

Edgar Eckmann was born in Rye New
York resides in New Orleans
Louisiana

Bonnie looks at the photographs notes the similarities the
differencesthen squints at Gilda

GILDA (CONTD)

(canned)

another life so they can get some
perspective on their own

ERNIE

She doesn’t finish the sentence She goes to Ernie and takes
him by the hand pulls him up practically dragging him
towards the hallway

ERNIE

OwMom what are you doing
BONNIE

Go to the kitchen Ern and stay

Ernie remains confused looks at Edgar then heads toward the
kitchen

Bonnie stares daggers at Edgar
Edgar stands up says nothing

She walks over to him grabs him by the chin gives him a
long hard look right in the eyes searching for something
then she looks behind his ears his neck She grabs his
hands examining still not convinced then stands back and
gives him another hard sizing up for a few seconds

BONNIE (CONT’D)
Take your pants off

EDGAR
Excuse me

BONNIE

EDGAR
You’re joking

BONNIE
Do it

Edgar takes a second then obliges but leaves his boxers on

BONNIE (CONT’D)
And the rest

He gives her an “are you kidding me” look

BONNIE (CONT’D)
Now

He does and stands there with his boxers around his ankles
Bonnie looks down at his crotch After a few seconds

BONNIE (CONT’D)
Oh my God

Bonnie heads to Ernie’s dresser and arbitrarily grabs some
clothes in a jumble while keeping an eye on Edgar who
hasn’t moved She stops looks at him

BONNIE (CONTD)
Get in the car

EDGAR
And if I say no

BONNIE
Ill have Gilda come in and

Alice saunters into the bathroom in a bra panties and
heels She steps into a devastating dress next to him

BONNIE
(dry)
Congratulations I have a degree in

paper He sits in front of a dining room packed with VARIOUS
NEW ORLEANS CULTURAL ELITISTS around TWO HUNDRED OR SO
GUESTS in their suits and cocktail dresses

GOVERNOR DALY (0S)
(southern accent)

-One of my privileges as governor
is that I get to bestow this award
on a sometimes unsuspecting but
well deserved Louisiana based
writer and although Kate my wife
was rather adamant in her lobby for
me to sway the committee in their
choice for this year’s recipient I
had to agree with her

EXT DECATUR STREET PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 75

Bonnie pulls a rented Ford Focus into a spot and pops out of
the car followed by the others She looks around frantically

BONNIE
Where is it

Edgar points off at the ATTENDANTS by the CHECK-IN DESK
unmooring the Riverboat for departure

EDGAR
That should be it

Bonnie grabs Ernie by the hand and heads for the pier
blustered by the wind off the river

BONNIE
Come on

EDGAR
I’m not going

BONNIE

(stopping)

What

EDGAR

Why do I need to be there for you
to yell at your husband

She steps toward him

BONNIE
Listen to me whoever the hell you
are I have no idea what I’m
getting into and apparently you do
I’1ll also tell you I am capable of
anything when I’m angry and
currently I’m really God damned
angry so I suggest you get me on
that ship if you know what’s
healthy for you

GILDA
It’s a steamboat

BONNIE
Whatever it the hell is

She and Edgar stare at each other a moment
EDGAR
Before you bite his head off just

He starts heading for the boat Bonnie follows pulling Ernie
Gilda behind her

Gilda slows to a walk and watches them walk ahead

EXT RIVERBOAT - MOMENTS LATER 76

Bonnie Edgar and Ernie walk down the lower deck as the boat
engine kicks in and starts to pull away from the dock

Then Bonnie notices

BONNIE
Where’s Gilda

They all turn around and walk back to see her standing at the
end of the dock as the boat pulls out into the river

She waves to the three of them then turns away her work
done letting them go to resolve it themselves

Bonnie exhausted looks blankly at her then turns toward the
expanse of the rest of the boat

BONNIE (CONTD)
(to Ernie)
Ill be right back

She heads off along the railing

Applause

Fred sits there very uncomfortably as the Governor beckons
him to stand up

Fred eventually realizing he’s supposed to go up to the
podium stands steps over to it and looks out at the crowd
as they continue their ovation He allows a grin and looks
down at whatever he scribbled on the piece of paper beads of
sweat on his brow

EXT RIVERBOAT DECK - MOMENTS LATER 78

Bonnie storms along the railing looking for Fred She wears a
tumultuous expression that can’t be pinned to one specific
emotion She hurries toward the front until she reaches a
series of sliding glass doors and peers in

Fred and a few of THE OTHER GUESTS can’t help but notice
her peering through the glass

Fred’s stands there quietly surprised caught not sure how
to behave or respond in this circumstance

Bonnie lugs one of the doors open and bursts in to the full
room She stands there staring at him suppressing whatever
emotion she’s feeling to avoid making a scene

Fred shares eyes with her then the audience figuring out
who to address

Alice sees him seeing Bonnie

FRED
(into the microphone)
Ioum

He looks down at the podium

FRED (CONTD)
Ioum

Then back to Bonnie for a good moment happy to see her

FRED (CONTD)
Life seems so all of a sudden
Everything changes in some instant
you’re not paying attention
YouYou forget how to notice
things how to be honestwith
yourself or the person sitting next
to youIt feels like you were
married yesterday you remember
sweating as she walked down the
aisle like some kind of vision

MANY OF THE GUESTS look confused

FRED (CONTD)
Your kid’s going to be nine you’re
stumbling towards forty or whatever
age you are you sit in the same
room with this person you thought
you knew feeling like there’s
nothing left to sayYour wife
dies You don’t remember how to
enjoy your work much less anything
else How does ten years suddenly
happen

FRED (CONTD)
I have this problem with time the
way it just runs off carelessly
with what you thought was your
lifeThank you for reminding me
what seemed to have slipped my
mind I accept this award as a call
to get back to what I love

ApplauseFred faintly smiles and awkwardly walks off the
stage toward Bonnie as Governor Daly retakes the podium

Alice’s brow furrows as she sees Edgar behind Bonnie She
watches as Bonnie grabs Fred drags and out onto the deck

Alice storms for the door past THE CONFUSED GUESTS wondering
what the hell just happened

EXT RIVERBOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS 79

Alice charges out the open door and onto the deck after them
A FEW GUESTS peer out after her

She sees Fred with Bonnie now up at the front of the boat

ALICE
Hey

EDGAR (0S)
Alice

Alice turns back to see Edgar behind her then turns back to
Fred and Bonnie then stops again realizing and looks back
at Edgar confused

She stares at him a moment notices his bland outfit turns
back once more to Fred and Bonnie on the deck ahead then
back to Edgar again

ALICE
What the hell is going on

EXT THE FRONT RIVERBOAT DECK - MOMENTS LATER 80

Bonnie stands in front of Fred vibrating disheveled
exhausted out of reach from the dining room and guests
their hair and clothes windblown

They stare at each other the unspoken words saying
themselves They’re both jumbles of confusion and pretty much
anything else they can feel at this particular moment

BONNIE
Why

A beat

FRED
Have you ever had a moment when you
thought I’m doing this on purpose
I’m screwing up and I don’t know
why

She responds with a blank look

BONNIE
Are we in the twilight zone

FRED
No

In the background MORE GUESTS peer down the deck at them
curiously and Alice decks Edgar to the ground then crumbles
on top of him

BONNIE
Who does this Fred

FRED
How long did it take you to notice
I was gone

She thinks about it a bit busted as a silence settles in

FRED (CONTD)
We were likestale bread You’re
sharing French fries with Ethan I
can’t remember the last time you
let me put a finger on you next
thing you’1l be running off to
where ever it is people run off
tolike that woman with the
barista

BONNIE
You’re the one who took off
Fredand left me and left Ernie
with (stammers)I mean Jesus
Christ who does that What were
you thinking

He takes that in realizes she’s right

BONNIE (CONTD)
Well
A beat

FRED
I don’t think I was thinking

FRED (CONT’D)
Remember what I said about five
minutes after I asked you to marry
me

She thinks about it for a moment

A beat

BONNIE
Yeah “Don’t worry I’1l
eventually disappoint you”

FRED
Wellhere you go

BONNIE
You’re an idiotYou know just
because I don’t always want to
sleep with you doesn’t mean I don’t
want to wake up with you every
dayWe went stale It happens
Time has its wicked way The spark
goes it comes back it goes again
I get softer you get softer
gravity takes over it’s been ten
years Ten What’d you expect A
happy ending every day

FRED
Yeah

After a long thoughtful pause

BONNIE
My favorite thing it doesn’t
happen every week but
occasionally I’1l be working in
the kitchen and I‘ll stop for a
second and have thislull when I
get lonely all of a sudden and a
couple seconds later I remember
you’re just in the other room
Youre there reading your books
grading your papersThat’s almost
enough for me

FRED
Almost

BONNIE
Yeah almost

They look each other in the eyes the fading sunlight glaring
in

Bonnie faintly smiles at him sadly nostalgic Fred
reciprocatesand they stand there content for the moment
in the wind under a terrifyingly clear evening sky

FRED
Where’s Ernie

Bonnie realizes she doesn’t know

EXT THE UPPER DECK - MOMENTS LATER 81

Ernie leans on the upper deck railing peering into the wind
out at the river and New Orleans beyond

Fred climbs up onto the upper deck behind him sees him
Bonnie follows but stays behind as Fred walks over to stand
next to him looking out at whatever Ernie seems to be

looking for

FRED
Whatcha looking for

ERNIE
Whale migrations

Ernie turns to him a blank expression on his face for a
moment

FRED
How ya doing Ern

Ernie studies him the facial hair the suit the different
stylethen a smile creeps onto his face recognizing

ERNIE
Hey dad

Fred kneels down

FRED
I’m sorry Ern

Ernie looks at him another moment then walks into his
shoulder with a forgiving hug Fred tries to hold it
together

EDGAR (0S)
I should probably get those clothes
back before the natives get too
restless

Fred turns to see Edgar standing just in front of Bonnie with
a red imprint on his cheek

He’s followed by Alice who ascends onto the upper deck She
squints at Fred then at Edgar creeped out

Fred looks back at Ernie studying his face reflecting a
glad smile

FRED
Let me go do this and well go
home okay

Ernie nods

Fred looks to Bonnie stands and then follows Edgar off
along the upper deck toward some hanging life boats leaving
Alice and Bonnie standing there awkwardly as Ernie looks off
the side of the boat by the railing

Bonnie surveys Alice who feels Bonnie looking at her

ALICE
I’m freaked out as it is so can
you quit looking at me like that

BONNIE

(dry)
You think I’m clean and serene over
here

After a beat
BONNIE (CONT’D)
Did anything happen between you

two

ALICE
Not really

BONNIE
What the hell does not really mean

ALICE
No Nothing happenedI told him
something happened in his sleep
but nothing did

Bonnie wears a puzzled expression

ALICE (CONTD)
You can hold that over him if you
wantWhat about you two

Bonnie thinks about it

BONNIE
No Not really

82 EXT FURTHER DOWN THE UPPER DECK - MOMENTS LATER 82

Edgar walks a bit further then steps behind a life boat
kicks off Fred’s shoes and begins to take of Fred’s
clothesFred follows and starts to do the same undressing
in the persistent wind as the evening settles over the city

Nothing’s said for a moment Fred with his facial hair a bit
grown in taking off the suit looking the most like Edgar he
hasand Edgar taking off Fred’s Dockers the slight shadow
of a stubble starting to emerge after a day without shaving

FRED
(attempting to break the
silence)
I read your book

EDGAR
(nonchalant)
Thanks
FRED

If I were that good at something
I’‘d do more of it

Edgar stifles the gratitude in his expression

EDGAR
Ill take that into consideration

He passes Fred’s pants to him

FRED
You didn’t exactly make this easy

Edgar says nothing not contesting that idea
FRED (CONTD)
Alice

EDGAR
(knowing her drama)

EDGAR
(dry)
Thanks
Another beat

EDGAR (CONTD)
They’re just a distraction

FRED
What

EDGAR
That little group Alice’s
friend’sthey’re more a
distraction than anything elseI
suppose that’s what all this has
been

Fred looks up from pulling on his Dockers

FRED
From what

EDGAR
Youve got a beautiful family you
know that

FRED
YeahI do

Edgar buttons up his shirt

EDGAR
I bailed on teaching your classes
the last couple days called in
sick then forgot about it so you
may um have to deal with thatAnd
you’re never allowed back to the
Cheesecake Factory

FRED
What do you mean

EDGAR
I got in a fight there with some
douche-bag named Ethan

Fred takes that in accepting the quid pro quo
FRED
OkayAnything else I need to

worry about

EDGAR
Bonnie

After a second

FRED
I’m on that

They remain there stuck in a quiet moment as Fred finishes
putting on his clothes and Edgar finishes butting his shirt
then tying his tie
FRED (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you mention your wife

EDGAR
I don’t knowWhat could I have
told you that you hadn’t already
heard before

Edgar looks off into the evening pensive

Fred almost asks a question but let’s Edgar continue

A beat

EDGAR (CONTD)
Nothing holds it off the way you
hope it might

FRED
(confused)
Huh

EDGAR
You sit there in some dreadful
waiting room thinking holy shit
she’s dying

EDGAR (CONTD)
And all the things all those dumb
little things going to Rouses
Market together to get Pop Tarts
Folgers and some Windex Going to
our little cafe grading papers
across from each other walking
past each other in the kitchen
brushing our teeth together the
stuff you wouldn’t usually think
twice about that doesn’t really
seem like life when you’re doing it
cause it’s just what you do how
you fill the daysand then she’s
dying from some unnoticed lump
but it’s just another typical day
outside people running errands
buying groceries going to work
and what you’d had was all there
is

EDGAR (CONTD)
You’d do anything to get back to
itor something like it

Fred’s understanding moves in and he lets the weight
settlehe looks down at his feet wondering what the hell to
say and then decides on nothing

EDGAR (CONTD)
You love your wife

FRED
More than anything

After a second

FRED (CONTD)
It’s myself I have the problem
with

Edgar gives him a faint smile agreeing and puts on his suit
jacket

EDGAR
Well at some point we all have to
get over that

Fred gives him a faint smile back as they stand there sort
of understanding each other for the first time and continue
looking off at the skyline getting windblown under the tall
blue evening

INT BECKHAMS BOOKSHOP - A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LATER 83

EDGAR’S VOICE (0S)
Fred faintly smiled back at him as
they stood there sort of
understanding each other for the
first timeand continued looking
off at the skyline getting
windblown under the tall blue
evening

Edgar looks up from the end of his new bookApplause

He stands at the podium in front of a poster of himself with
a suggestive look next to the cover of the new book entitled
“Too” near a tall stack of his books on an adjacent table
and looks up and out at EVERYONE looking back at him

The bookstore is packed with HIPSTERS PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS
ELMORE LEONARD and SYCOPHANTS MOST OF THE WOMEN whom make
up most of the crowd stare longingly at him

Alice stands in the background with Edith

Edgar looks through the crowd searching for someoneto no
avail

INT BECKHAMS BOOKSHOP - A BIT LATER THAT EVENING 84

Edgar sits at a table signing books He smiles gratuitously
as he passes a book to A FAN then reaches for another opens
it and without looking up prepares to sign the inside cover

EDGAR
Who can I make it out to

FRED (0S)
Fred

After a pause Edgar looks up to see who’s standing
thereand smiles

EDGAR
I’m glad you made it

FRED
Me too

Edgar notices Bonnie and Ernie standing in the background
shares a wave with them

Fred puts a copy of the New York Times open to a review of
Edgar’s book in front of him

FRED (CONT’D)
Nice review

EDGAR

FRED
Did you notice this

Fred points to the opposite page from the review - in a half
page ad-space sits the roman numeral II over the slogan Find
Your Self wwwtoocom
