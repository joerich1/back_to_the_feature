SILENCE DARKNESS

INT STUDIO NIGHT

A sleek modern room nearly erupting with African art Statues in
various corners Paintings on the walls Beneath a skylight sits A
RAISED BEDSTAND all drenched in black bed dressings Pillows Sheets
Everything Like a Herb Rites video only worse

Beneath the pile somewhere lies CARY handsome compact thirties
pumping away for all he’s worth

He moves at a brisk pace forcing the mattress to shudder markedly
beneath his chiseled weight He studies 18 PARTNER as he moves

CARY
I mean is it me Because I think youre a great lay no I
mean that I feel special coming inside you m
serious Pm always gonna think of you as a very special fuck
and I only hope that you like it

A burst of concentrated energy takes his breath away and he speaks i
gasps

Obh that’s good Is it not something What Not
tender Should I be being more tender now or add some
sweetness

THE BODY MOTION stops cold as Cary nearly springs out of bed
whipping the covers out of his way Only now is it obvious that there is
no one beneath him He is fully clothed from the waist down he glances
at his watch and smiles Suddenly he picks up a small tape recorder
from the nightstand and rewinds it He presses PtaY and listens to
himself in the act He smiles

Yeah Id believe that mean if 1 was a chick ’d believe
it
(resets the recorder)

Alright One more time before she gets here come on
let’s pick up the pace

The watch gets a second glance then Cary ts back at it thrusting and
jabbing through another practice round for all he’s worth

BLACKOUT BLAST OF CREDITS

SLOW FADE IN ON

INT THE THEATRE DAY

An industrial space with dark maroon seating A SEMI-CIRCLE of
INDIVIDUALS listen to Jerry a tall man in his mid-thirties as he
rehearses a scene from Wycherley’s The Country Wife ith an
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG CO-ED

JERRY

(in character voice)
‘Gad though you laugh now twill be my turn ’ere long Oh
women more impertinent more cunning and more
mischievous than their monkeys and to me almost as ugly
She has been throwing me about and rifling all Ihave

(throws her two the bed)

But Pll get in to her the back way and so rifle her for it’

(breaks character)
Scene

Jerry drops his hands and takes a deep breath and an acting moment
CHUCKLING a bit as HIS STUDENTS MURMUR 10 themselves until

Jerry qutets them

Okay alright now I know your classmate and I’ve turned this
into a provocative little scene I know that but that is always
the challenge even in a period piece I mean what’re we
looking at here Huh Lace and language aside in the end it’s
just men and women right Just like any other story like
every story and ultimately what do these characters want
Hmm I know it’s embarrassing for you to say but let’s
be honest they wanna fuck Correct It’s always all about
fucking
A RELEASE OF LAUGHTER from the students ONE CO-ED smiles up
from beneath her trendy rimless glasses Jerry returns it

INT APARTMENT NIGHT

Handsomely decorated but cramped apartment Bookcases line the four
walls Framed posters of dead foreign authors abound

A BEAUTIFUL BED is shaking wildly as A COUPLE performs furiously
in the darkness Impossible to make them out clearly but the rhythm is
undeniable Almost catchy Like Billie Holiday taking on the horn
section in the back of a bus

JERRY ts crouched behind TERRI a striking woman in her early
thirties He attacks her with zeal as they go cloaked only by a thin
sheet

JERRY
Oh yeah yeah that’s it Ob yeah I’m with you Baby
Absolutely Can you feel it That’s right You and I are in
complete harmony here Mmm

TERRI stops cold but Jerry continues his ‘erotic’ monologue as he drives
along

TERRI
Ts there any chance you’re gonna shut the fuck up

JERRY
What
JERRY stiffens and stops taking a moment to collect his thoughts and
catch his breath Terri moves away and snaps on a lamp
TERRI
You’re talking right in my ear I’m losing any sense of
concentration that I might’ve had

JERRY
Well Pm just it’s kinda hard to stop in the

TERRI
Well keep it to yourself I mean “Can you feel ic Your thing

is nearly in the back of my throat You think m gonna miss
that

(beat)
Lets just do it don’t need the narration Okay

JERRY is still kneeling but quickly moves away from his partner and
settles down into the blankets for the battle

JERRY
What is this

TERRI
I’m sorry but this is not a travelogue you know

JERRY
Jesus

TERRI
Iv’s how I feel

JERRY

Oh great That’s great
Jerry gets up and starts getting dressed

TERRI

Why do we always have to go through this shit
(beat)

JERRY
Yeah I know and it’s so fucking enjoyable you know I
mean I so much as start to breathe and you stop What is

that

TERRI
It’s me

JERRY
Yeah well its fucked

TERRI
Okay

(sighs)

JERRY
No I don’t wanna watch Why is it that your cunt is like —
and don’t like to use that word but goddammit — it’s like
your vagina is seemingly tied directly to my mouth Why is
that Huh It’s like Iso much as crack open my lips for a
breath and you’re squeezing me off What is that It’s like
our two organs ate on some fucking pullcord here and I’m
Um You know what Pm sick of it

(beat)

TH talk as much as I like

TERRI

Good I hope she enjoys it ’cause you won’t be fucking
me

JERRY
Fine That’s beautiful That’s lovely

Ferry is dressed now and he grabs his jacket from a chair
Could I have my keys please

Terri back on the bed scoops them off a nightstand and holds them up
JINGLING them provocatively while Jerry in no mood holds his hand
out impatiently Terri begins to smile and shake her head ‘No when
Jerry SNAPS his fingers Her smile freezes over and she tosses the Reys at
him a bit hard They catch his finger and glance off on to the floor He
CURSES HER QUIETLY and sucks on his hand as he retrieves the ring

TERRI
Where you going

JERRY
I don’t know out I feel like talking I just wanna chat
Okay

TERRI
Look we can talk just don’t want something in my ass
while we’re doing it

JERRY
Go fuck yourself
TERRI
Don’t give me any ideas Hey

JERRY
What

TERRI
Hey bring me some ice cream if you go by a store
Okay

THE DOOR swings open and Jerry stands in the archway glaring at her
After a moment he SLAMS it for effect as he exits

SUDDENLY ALONE for a moment Terri reaches across for the television
remote She puils the sheet over herself and leans back

cUuT TO

INT OFFICE DAY

A simple handsome space with a wooden desk at one end Glass on
several sides allowing for a view of towering buildings in the distance
Barry a plain-looking muscular man of about thirty-five sits back in
a swivel chair chewing down a sandwich and TALKING while AN
ASSOCIATE sits opposite him digging into a meatball sub Both in
regulation shirt tie suspenders The works

BARRY
So you want to know what The ‘best’ lay I’ve ever
had Right

A PIECE OF SANDWICH slips from his sagging hoagie to the desk as
both men guffaw at this notion Barry reaches over and rescues the
fallen meat from his blotter gobbling it up as he smiles over at his co-
worker

‘That’s easy It’s me Nobody gives me more pleasure than
I give myself I mean that I mean not that my wife’s terrible
or anything she’s not she’s wonderful but she’s just
not me You know And I like doing it with her Ido
but Pll tell you the real fireworks take place when she heads

” off to the shower know what I mean
THE MEN share ANOTHER GOOD-NATURED LAUGH at Barry’s hand
gestures while they munch away

You probably think I’m kidding but P’ve lived with this
hell all my life and Pm telling you nobody makes me
come the way I do

INT BROWNSTONE BEDROOM NIGHT

A master bedroom in a newly restored brownstone Moving boxes
stacked in corners Designer sheets cover the windows Martha Stewart
in the making In the middle of the room sits AN ENORMOUS BED
covered in mounds of stark white sheets TWO FIGURES are struggling
in the sea of fabric pushing against each other Making love but
distant

MARY Quiet pretty woman in her early thirties lies on her stde and
clutches a pillow as BARRY holds himself up on one elbow and looks
over at his wife as he works She opens her mouth to speak but catches
herself Her husband shifts forward glancing at the time and briefly
ending the siege

BARRY
Hmm Oh yeah Yeah Come on Comeon

There is only silence from Mary as he quietly disengages

I’m sorry IjustI mean Oh God Is it me I need
to T just got a bad go of it from here that’s all Your
legs don’t open as cleanly from I mean is this something
you really like This ‘side-saddle’ thing Hmm

BARRY shifts his weight about propping himself up with an armload of
pillows He’s digging in for a long campaign

You feel it’s me don’t you I can just -

(beat)
Hey honey Pl bet Adam and Eve you know from the Old
‘Testament they probably never did it on their side I
mean until they were out of the garden like after they were
thrown out or bored Or something
ASMILY appears on his lips az this thought but quickly fades

Because it’s just not a natural It’s me isn’t it Of course it
is or you’d be talking

beat
We could just start again honey Because I’m still quite
hard Really It’s completely firmed up Down there

Silence After a moment Barry rolls over on his side away from his
wife He begins masturbating

BARRY
Isn’t that a boy’s name

CARY
He was a guy from my high school PE class my best fuck

BARRY
What

CARY
It’s the truth It was almost spring vacation late March
and wed had about all che shit we could take from little
Timmy He’d turned four of us in during an English exam
earlier in the week and so when the coach was down in
the lounge for a smoke we grabbed his ass and dragged him
into the showers We held him down tore off his clothes

and we each took a turn I mean we actually ‘did’ this
guy Up the burt I mean we were some crazy fuckers at thar
age

A bottle of water is opened by Cary and he sucks it down while he recalls
the event

I was the last one So I don’t know if he’d just given over by
this time or what but goddammnit it was nice I
mean how can I explain this It’s never been like that with a
woman as many as I fuck Never Never even close

He was face down and my friends were holding him spread
out But Timmy and I were makin’ love like we were on some
beach in the Mediterranean I kid you not Fuck it was
amazing I could feel him taking my rhythm He was
clinching me off when Id get too deep Shit he did
everything right And I know he came when I did I mean I
didn’t check or anything but —I could tell I shouldn’t even
be telling you guys but fuck Pve never known anything
like it Ever Like I said there wasn’t too much of the school
year left and Timmy dropped out I guess I mean he
finished from home Goddamn him He never turned us in
He never said a word about it to anyone And I admired him
for that Burt I think the reason he kept silent -- and I feet m

right about this — is that he felt something special had
happened as well Him and me I mean those other guys
they just fucked him to teach him a lesson but we I know
something special happened

THE BOTTLE 1s carelessly crushed by Cary as he stares off lost in
thought He sets it down with a TINY CLATTER near his feet Jerry and
Barry don’t make a sound Cary smiles thinly over at his pals as Barry
