INT US CONGRESS - WAITING ROOM - DAY

ELIZABETH SLOANE stares at us contemptuously Articulate
quick-witted and direct

ELIZABETH
Lobbying is about foresight About
anticipating your opponent’s moves
and devising countermeasures The
winner plots one step ahead of the
opposition and plays her trump card
just after they play theirs

She’s actually speaking to her attorney DANIEL POSNER (40s)
who stands frustrated as that wasn’t the answer he wanted

POSNER
Tell me you’re going to take this
seriously when you’re in there

He motions to the DOOR An atmospheric BUZZ of anticipation
emanates from behind it Elizabeth is seated unruffled

ELIZABETH
It’s about making sure you surprise
them and they don’t surprise you

POSNER
Youre gonna say that Come on
again
(interrogatory)
Could you please describe the nature
of your work

ELIZABETH
(petulant)
Upon the advice of counsel I must
respectfully decline to answer your
question based on my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the United
States Constitution

Posner claps sarcastically

POSNER
Those words - when you’re not taking
the oath or confirming details -
those words in that order are all
you’re gonna say

(interrogatory)

Ms Sloane on average would you say
you bribed public officials more or
less than once a month

ELIZABETH
Upon the advice of counsel - am I
allowed to deviate slightly On the
advice of counsel On the advice of
my attorney I understand if that
last one’s too adventurous for you

POSNER
You do not-
ELIZABETH
This would be a whole lot easier if I
could just shout ‘Fifth’

POSNER
No deviations

ELIZABETH
Can I use a silly voice
(silly voice)
Upon the advice of counsel

That’s the last straw Posner deflates shuts down A pause
The first time we hear the full extent of the RUCKUS outside
the waiting room Softly

POSNER
This isn’t a joke They want you
behind bars You make one statement
correct one nefarious allegation
that’s it You waive your right to
the Fifth and you’re compelled to
answer everything You’re being taken
to the woodshed in front of the
national press they’re gonna rile
you so bad they’d make Gandhi wanna
cut their tongues out

ELIZABETH
Daniel When I take the stand you’1l
see nothing but a granite wall

POSNER
Good

Elizabeth stands up straight shoulders back She makes a
minor adjustment to her professional business attire No one
but her would’ve noticed the near-imperceptible blemish

Posner glances at his watch

POSNER (CONTD)
You’re on in five
(extends hand)
Ms Sloane Good luck

She does not shake

ELIZABETH
You’re on retainer Mr Posner to
remove luck from the equation

With a subtle shake of the head Posner turns and trudges out
The pervasive BUZZ ratchets up the second the door is opened
and mutes once more as it closes

Now alone Elizabeth EXHALES deeply a valve abruptly
unblocked As if suddenly weak in the knees she sits back
down Stares into the middle distance determination
extingiushed from her eyes

She snatches her Fendi handbag and rummages in it Her hands
now tremble nerves taking hold She finds what she’s looking
for - a small TRINKET BOX

She considers it for a moment hands still fidgeting Her eyes
snap shut DEEP BREATHS to calm a racing heart

Breathe Breathe Breathe

Definitively she closes her palm on the box as those
determined eyes blink back into existence

Elizabeth steps to the desk and rockets the trinket box into
the trash can She grabs her handbag and strides out head
held high

EXT UNITED STATES CAPITOL - DAY

A REPORTER gives a live news update

REPORTER
Elizabeth Sloane is set to take the
stand for the first time any moment
now the controversial lobbyist faces
charges of bribery and corruption-

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY

SUPER September 14 2015

The biggest hearing room available to Congress is packed to
the rafters JOURNALISTS jostle for a better position The
public gallery full of important-looking SUITS TV cameras pan
the room Every square inch taken The knives are out

CROSS-FADE NEWS REPORTS

ANALYST (VO)
- Traditionally a free-market and
anti-tax advocate Elizabeth Sloane
has more recently led a full-frontal
assault on the Second Amendment
going up against the Gun Lobby in
support of the Heaton-Harris
Amendment on gun control a veritable
David vs Goliath battle for the
veteran strategist Congress is set
to allege that Ms Sloane has made a
career out of subverting American
democracy

ANCHOR (VO)
Allegations abound of dirty tricks
from giant inflatable rodents to
hiring movie extras to

A BARRAGE OF FLASHBULBS greet Elizabeth and Posner as they
enter the arena flanked by FOUR CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS

The media go into overdrive
ELIZABETH

This is tight You’d think they’d
choose a more appropriate venue
POSNER
Turns out the Redskins had a home
game

Elizabeth takes the stand to face SEVEN CONGRESSMEN Three sit
on either side of the man leading the assault

Congressman RON M SPERLING (60s D-Ohio) Chairman of the
House Committee on Ways and Means A doddery old bumpkin
harmlessly paternal chummy and relatable He speaks with the
solemn authority of someone doing the moral wholesome bidding
of the people

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Please raise your right hand Do you
solemnly swear that you will tell the
truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth under pains and
penalties of perjury

ELIZABETH
I do

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Please sit Will the witness please
state her full name for the record

ELIZABETH
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING

And could the witness please confirm
these details are accurate aaahhh

(fumbles through notes)
Date of birth September 18 1966
current address 4 Heron Court Chevy
Chase Section 5 Montgomery County
Maryland

ELIZABETH
Correct

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
You won an academic scholarship to
study Law at Yale University where
you graduated Summa Cum Laude

ELIZABETH
Yes

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
And you were employed by Cole
Kravitz and Waterman LLP for a ten
year period between 2004 and 2014
before moving earlier this year to-

ELIZABETH
Eleven year period

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Excuse me

ELIZABETH
There are eleven years between 2004
and 2014

That kills his momentum He refers back to his notes shakes
his head One of his staffers will pay for that Elizabeth
smiles very faintly A small victory Posner shakes his head

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
What was the nature of your work at
Cole Kravitz and Waterman LLP

ELIZABETH
(deep breath)
Upon the advice of counsel I must
respectfully decline to answer your
question based on my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the United
States Constitution

A MUTED GROAN from the press as their expectations are met
She’s true to her word A wall of granite

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Did you November 29th of last year
accept as a client the government of
the African Republic of Kenya for
the purpose of campaigning against
the levy of additional Federal duties
on the importation of palm oil into
the United States

ELIZABETH
Upon the advice of counsel I must
respectfully decline to answer your
question based on my rights
And so it continues

INT COLE KRAVITZ AND WATERMAN LLP - BATHROOM - DAY - PAST

SUPER 7 MONTHS PRIOR

Elizabeth swamped and running on fumes is followed into the
toilets by her young protégé JANE MOLLOY

JANE
Today’s a landmark day you know why
Because I’m free

ELIZABETH
Name one thing you can do today that
you couldn’t’ve done yesterday

JANE
Quit my job

ELIZABETH
You could have done that yesterday
but it would’ve been stupid

JANE
But I can quit today and-

ELIZABETH
Itll still be stupid You clear your
college debt and celebrate by
enrolling in post-grad and returning
to square one

JANE
Academia’s more my scene

Elizabeth enters a stall and latches the door

ELIZABETH
You didn’t follow me into the crapper
to gloat about freedom Talk to me
about the Nutella tax

Elizabeth reaches into her handbag for a bottle of water She
takes two pills out of the TRINKET BOX we glimpsed earlier
and gulps them down

JANE
Were really calling it ‘Nutella
tax’

ELIZABETH

Palm oil is a key ingredient in
Nutella If the Federal Government
taxes it at 300 it’1l cost more for
us to gorge ourselves on it

JANE
Isn’t palm oil in pretty much
everything

ELIZABETH
We could have called it Soap Tax but
the public cares more about Nutella
than it does soap Ross did surveys

JANE
OK Estevez Frame and Albert are in

the bag Hodges-

ELIZABETH
See that should elicit some kind of
reaction but it just doesn’t

JANE
-is under pressure The FandB sector
are organized They represent 7 of
the North Carolina economy and
accounted for two thirds of job
growth over the last twelve months
They’re getting loud and he can’t
afford to ignore them

ELIZABETH
Sounds like critical mass to me

JANE
What are you gonna do

Elizabeth FLUSHES the toilet (she never went) and exits

ELIZABETH
It’s time we made our move on the
sallow little gimp who’s sponsoring
this larceny Tell the Kenyans
they’re going to host Senator Davis
on an all-expenses-paid field trip to
one of their plantations
JANE
You never washed your hands

Elizabeth shrugs it off and washes

ELIZABETH
Hell take the wife and kids and
whatever luxuries the Kenyan
government confer on him will stay
between he and them He’1ll come back
hailing their conservation efforts
and his bill will die a quiet death

They exit the ladies’ room into --

INT COLE KRAVITZ AND WATERMAN LLP - DAY - PAST

-- a stuffy conservative stalwart of the Dc legal industry
Walk and talk

JANE
That’s legitimate They can ply him
with champagne and truffles

ELIZABETH
And diamonds gold watches and
whatever else The Congressional gift
ban doesn’t apply to sovereign
states

JANE
So a Congressman can technically get
rich by sponsoring bills that screw
foreign governments and wait for them
to buy him off

ELIZABETH
That’s a little too much work for a
class of people who exempt themselves
from insider trading laws

JANE
You see This is why I’m thinking
about post-grad

ELIZABETH
Jane we go to school because it
prepares us for the real world You
happen to find yourself at the sharp
end of the real world at the age of
twenty-nothing

JANE
I’m not so sure I like the ‘real
world’

ELIZABETH

So you’re going to bury your head in
the Socrates

JANE
You know that Socrates never actually
wrote anything
ELIZABETH
That’s beside the point If you don’t
like it strive to change it Which
is what you’re already doing that’s
why you’re here See You’re exactly
where you belong

Reasoned into a corner Jane is silenced Elizabeth is hounded
by a young intern (SPENCER)

SPENCER
Ms Sloane They’re ready for you
upstairs

ELIZABETH

Spencer did you know that Americans
care more about Nutella than they
care about soap

SPENCER
(shrugs)
OK
ELIZABETH
(to Jane)
See that No reaction
They enter

INT STRATEGY ROOM - CONTINUOUS - PAST

Pins stuck in maps files boxes C-SPAN and CNN on the TVs
This is where the ritual morning meeting takes place between
Elizabeth and her team of around TEN LOBBYISTS

Note that these guys are out of kilter with the uptight wood-
paneled ambiance of the firm Very few of them wear suits
these aren’t old boys’ club lobbyists They’re a young
ambitious team of varying backgrounds who go harder than
anyone else and pay lip service to industry mores

They continue to work and confer during the meeting flitting
in and out of conversation with their leader Elizabeth makes
her rounds This happens fast rapid-fire

ELIZABETH
Alright this should be short

LOBBYIST 1 (ALEX)
You always say it’s gonna be short

LOBBYIST 2 (LAUREN)
It’s never short

ELIZABETH
It is today Ross how many are they
expecting at the IMF rally
ROSS is the statistical whizz early 30s -

ROSS
Between five hundred and a thousand
ELIZABETH
There’s a margin of 100
(hopeful)
Does that technically mean nobody
might show up

ROSS
Five hundred is really a minimum The
rest depends on things like weather
seems more people hate banks when the
sun’s out

Enter PAT CONNORS (40s Boston-Irish foul-mouthed and
fiercely loyal the de facto second-in-command)

CONNORS
Liz It’s time we sold Davis on
Kenya

ELIZABETH
I know-

CONNORS

When Hodges falls we’ve got critic-

ELIZABETH
Critical mass I’m aware-

CONNORS
We get him a first class ticket they
give him face and he’1ll drop it

ELIZABETH
Did you just come from the ladies’
room

CONNORS
I have no idea what you’re talking
about

ELIZABETH
Ross how’s the weather forecast for
later

ROSS

They put one of these over the whole
of Manhattan

Ross draws a weather symbol on the whiteboard - a cloud with
rain falling and sunshine behind it

ELIZABETH
What the hell is that

CONNORS
It’s the internationally recognized
meteorological symbol for ‘we don’t
have a fucking clue’

ELIZABETH
Alright put Metro Talent on notice
we may need reinforcements And prep
non-disclosures
FRANKLIN is

LAUREN
Were really gonna use movie extras

ELIZABETH
What’s the quickest way to end an
anti-capitalism protest

CONNORS
Throw a bar of soap in the crowd

ELIZABETH
Corrupt their message Their
arguments are immature but some of
these people make valid points The
guy shouting about taxpayers
subsidizing bankers’ failure becomes
a lot less credible when he’s
standing next to a guy styled as a
hobo toting a banner that reads
“abolish money”

CONNORS
“Shit is fucked up and bullshit”
Best banner at Occupy Tell me that
was one of yours

ELIZABETH
(shakes head)
That was creative way beyond my
capabilities
(moving on)
Franklin Shmallow Cakes

a slightly geeky junior

FRANKLIN
Ah - yeah

ELIZABETH

So does sales tax apply to chocolate-

covered cakes and chocolate-covered
biscuits or only to one and not the
other

FRANKLIN
I Don’t know
ELIZABETH
You don’t know
(to all)

Alright guys listen up I’m going to
tell you a story

CONNORS
Please no

ELIZABETH
A priest is giving a young nun a lift
home from church one day and as he’s
shifting gear he rests his hand on
the nun’s knee

CONNORS
This is offensive and inappropriate

ELIZABETH
The young nun looks at the priest and
says ‘Father remember Luke 1410’
The priest withdraws his hand
embarrassed Next time they stop at
lights the priest rests his hand a
little higher up on her thigh and
again the nun says ‘Remember Luke
1410 Father’ The priest
apologizes ‘The flesh is weak’ he
says So he drops her off and when
he gets back home the priest reaches
for his bible and flips to Luke
1410 Anyone know what it says

Blank stares

ELIZABETH
What does it say Pat

CONNORS
(rolls eyes)
Friend come up higher then shalt
thou have glory

Chuckles and sniggers

ELIZABETH

Know your subject people Failure to
do so may result in the loss of a
golden opportunity

(to Franklin)
When I see you this afternoon youd
better be ready to recite that tax
code in Esperanto
(to all heading to door)
That’s it get to it

ALEX
What were done

LAUREN
That was short

ELIZABETH
I said it’d be short

LAUREN
You always say it’1ll be short

ELIZABETH
(exiting mild disdain)
I don’t always have to meet with the
prunes

INT COLE KRAVITZ AND WATERMAN - EXEC OFFICE - DAY - PAST

The Executive Office is reserved for the most important
clients and feels more like a country club This morning’s
occupants are

GEORGE DUPONT (a belligerent 82 Head of Government Affairs
and one of the biggest hitters in the whole firm)

RM DUTTON (poster-boy lobbyist 50s a cold and inhuman
tactician with piercing blue eyes) and

BOB SANDFORD (60s powerful and well-connected President of
the Gun Lobby and potential golden goose client)

They sit in chesterfield leather seats waiting

BOB SANDFORD
So I’m told I should offer my hand

GEORGE
How d’you mean

BOB SANDFORD
When we meet I’m told she doesn’t do
all the kissy-kissy crap most women
do these days

GEORGE
You two have never met

BOB SANDFORD
We’ve attended the same functions
but never been introduced

GEORGE
In a town this small how does that
happen-

There is a perfunctory KNOCK on the door

BOB SANDFORD
So I should offer my hand

RM DUTTON
(mildly peeved)
I wouldn’t worry about it

Elizabeth enters

GEORGE
Ah here she is Liz Bob Sandford
President of the Gun Lobby

She’s quick out of the blocks in offering her hand a polished
and professional evasion of awkwardness

ELIZABETH
I’m amazed it’s taken this long

BOB SANDFORD
I wanted to introduce myself at the
Free Enterprise dinner I’d done my
homework - there I got a glimpse into
the enigma that is Liz Sloane You
throw the biggest party of the year
and you’re first out the door

ELIZABETH
Minor crisis on the hill
BOB SANDFORD
A lesser commander-in-chief would
have left that to a soldier which is
exactly why I’m here Liz my
organization has reservations about
the Heaton-Harris Amendment

ELIZABETH
Really I’m not overly familiar
with it but I heard the Gun Lobby
was responsive to proposals to
increase the effectiveness of
background checks

BOB SANDFORD
We are broadly But the language
here is extensive Longer delays
some Big Brother-type criminal and
mental health database for use on
all sales of firearms Between father
and son Lifelong friends Our
members will view this as an
intolerable fetter on the Second
Amendment We want you to be the one
to make sure this bill never sees the
light of day

ELIZABETH
Mr Sandford you understand that I
deal primarily in taxation and
Federal Government interference in
free enter-

BOB SANDFORD
We’re well aware But you and your
team take no prisoners and get things
done The reputation you’ve garnered
over the past few years weve been
practically waiting for an excuse to
hire you

ELIZABETH
(beat)

As I say I’m not familiar with the
wording but if this bill will reduce
the likelihood of firearms falling
into the wrong hands it may be in
your long-term interests to support
it

George and Dutton share a panicked look

GEORGE
Liz

BOB SANDFORD
I don’t understand-

ELIZABETH
Every time a madman opens fire in
public more support amasses for
truly extensive prohibitions on
firearms the more precarious the
position of every reasonable gun
owner in America

(MORE)

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Rigorous background checks should be
the Gun Lobby’s best friend Of
course this would entail telling
your five million plus members
something they don’t want to hear
Which will guarantee that you’1ll be a
one-term president of the Gun Lobby
But by my reckoning it’s your best
option to secure the future of the
Second Amendment It’s just a
question of whether you’d be willing
to make the personal sacrifice

BOB SANDFORD

Personal sacrifice
(long uneasy pause)

Liz These are extensive

ELIZABETH
I see Well why don’t I look at the
wording and we’1ll proceed from there

INT COLE KRAVITZ AND WATERMAN LLP - DAY - PAST

Dutton just about keeps pace with George on the warpath

GEORGE
Ill look at the wording and proceed
from there who the hell does she
think she --

RM DUTTON
This can be spun At least they know
she’s not out to bilk them that it’s
their interests she’s representing
For the purposes of building trust
that may have been the right tactical
move

GEORGE
And do you believe for one
nanosecond that lobbyist-client bond-
building was at the forefront of her
mind when she effectively told Bob
Sandford to take his business and
shove it up his gun barrel

RM DUTTON
I was just saying

Dutton peels off and George storms into his office yelling
out to his SECRETARY on the way -

GEORGE
I want Sloane in my office now

SECRETARY
Ah Mr Dupont

INT GEORGE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - PAST

George marches in and is taken by surprise-

ELIZABETH
(re Secretary)
She’s good isn’t she

GEORGE
Youll look at the wording Well I’m
sure the President of one of the most
powerful representative groups on the
hill will be honored that Her
Majesty has agreed to look at the
fucking wording

ELIZABETH
Did you consider that my lack of
enthusiasm might demonstrate to them
that I’m protecting their int-

GEORGE
Don’t feed me that crap and call it
ice cream What’s going on with you

ELIZABETH
Remember when you interviewed me
Eons ago You asked if I could
represent a client whose position I
vehemently disagreed with

GEORGE
So what

ELIZABETH
Foolishly I told the truth I said
‘No’ Not for money respect nor
professional integrity I thought I’d
just blown the interview The next
two and a half words out of your
mouth were ‘You’re hired’

GEORGE
What I didn’t tell you is that you’re
supposed to have grown out of that
infantile save-the-world idealism by
your second year

ELIZABETH
I do whatever it takes to win because
I only fight for causes I actually
believe in-

GEORGE
Youre suddenly a proponent of gun
control

ELIZABETH

The current system is so porous it
floats The Heaton-Harris Amendment
is necessarily extensive to redress

it

GEORGE
I thought you had to ‘look at the
wording’ -

ELIZABETH

I know very well what it says
GEORGE
When did this happen I don’t
remember you ever caring one way or
the other about gun control

ELIZABETH
I guess my position solidified
somewhere between Columbine and
Aurora Right now background checks
only apply to sales from federally
licensed gun dealers Leaving any two-
bit thug or head-case free to procure
a thirty-eight special from a gun
show the internet or his buddy from
the Bowl-o-rama Heaton-Harris puts a
full-stop to this stupidity and
about time too

GEORGE
Christ Liz this isn’t any old
client waltzing through the door
this is the Gun Lobby No something
happened - someone you know was a
victim of a gun crime

ELIZABETH
Nonsense I formed an opinion

GEORGE
Youre a champion of the free market
You abhor taxation and frivolous
government spending meddling
patronizing-

ELIZABETH
I would hardly categorize responsible
gun control as frivolous-—

GEORGE
Kenyans For Christ’s sake you rep
Kenyans

ELIZABETH

To stop our all-consuming government

from looting one of their few sources
of income There’s a cause I can get

behind And what’s wrong with Kenya

Were about to close Len Davies with

a field trip there

GEORGE
Is that a promise or a threat I can
just picture the good Senator being
boiled in a cauldron with all these
natives dancing around him

Elizabeth puts her head in her hands despairing

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Get some Fortune 500 clients Your
colorful representations are the
cause of a lot of industry back-chat
this firm’s good name can do without

ELIZABETH
Could it do without the thirty grand
a month retainer

GEORGE

You bully people Liz You’re a
bully with your unorthodox tactics
and endless supply of inflammatory
quotes Senior Partners are banging
on my door fearing for our rep and
that’s something I can do without

ELIZABETH

You’re hardly a stranger to
“unorthodox tactics” It’d be quicker
to list the Congressmen you havent
strong-armed threatened or
blackmailed I apply tactical
creative ethical methods and that’s
how I sleep at night

GEORGE
Really Sloane Those little pills in
your purse are the kind that lull you
to sleep

Elizabeth’s eyes narrow He’s crossing a line

ELIZABETH
My point we’re different animals in
the same cage And I still win which
is why the Gun Lobby just walked
through our front door-

GEORGE
And you sent them straight back out
of it You’re right The only reason
you and your team of sneaker-wearing
ragamuffins are still here is that
your arrogant pranks might generate
enough buzz to attract clients like
the Gun Lobby Meaning if you don’t
personally dedicate yourself to their
cause the partnership won’t really
have any use for you Your billings
for this firm’s reputation is a trade
they’d be happy to make Now go away
re-read that amendment and start
telling the world how goddamn
extensive it is

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY - PAST

Elizabeth consults with her DOCTOR She can’t get out of the
room fast enough She reads and responds to emails on her
Blackberry fingertips blistering over the tiny keys like a
stenographer on coke

DOCTOR
Any dizziness

ELIZABETH
No

DOCTOR
Nausea

ELIZABETH
None

DOCTOR

No disorientation at all

ELIZABETH
Doctor I’m fine really Whatever it
was you gave me did the trick

DOCTOR
What time d’you go to sleep most
nights
ELIZABETH
Well it varies-
DOCTOR
What time did you go to sleep last
night
(beat)

This morning

ELIZABETH
These are busy times

DOCTOR

So I see by your eagerness to get
this over with You don’t need a
doctor to tell you you’re working
yourself into an early grave

ELIZABETH
The pills did help me sleep

DOCTOR
Pills aren’t the answer The long
hours and levels of stress you’re
exposed to would be dangerous for a
twenty year-old

(beat)

I’m going to write you a
prescription but it’ll only cover
you for the next two weeks

The Doctor scribbles down a prescription and hands it over
DOCTOR
I want to see you back here in a
fortnight with your phone off and
eight hours under your belt

EXT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - PAST

Elizabeth strides out at pace Scrunches the prescription and
deposits it in the nearest trash can

INT DC FUNDRAISER - NIGHT - PAST

The ballroom of a five-star hotel is alive with Washingtons
most powerful Phoney affectations champagne and canapes

INT TOILET STALL - CONTINUOUS - PAST

Elizabeth sits atop a closed commode with her head in her
hands savoring invisibility and relative quiet A lifetime of
‘being on’ has taken its toll like she herself is building
towards critical mass

She reaches into her handbag and flips open her trinket box
She looks tired burnt out She considers the four pills
inside long and hard but denies herself She flips it shut
flushes (she never went) and exits

EXT JEFFERSON HOTEL - NIGHT - PAST

Elizabeth strides from the hotel on a crisp winter’s night
and is caught up by a PERSISTENT MAN in his 40s

PERSISTENT MAN
Early night

She doesn’t stop

ELIZABETH
If you’re here for a quote you’re
wasting both of our time

Neither does he

PERSISTENT MAN
I’ve just watched you extricate
yourself from three conversations to
use the ladies’ room in the space of
thirty minutes

ELIZABETH
You busted me I’m incontinent Go
ahead write it up

PERSISTENT MAN
I hope I’m wrong but one could be
forgiven for thinking you’re sick of
this town

She looks at him for the first time

ELIZABETH
I haven’t seen you before You work
for the Post How’d you get in

PERSISTENT MAN
Id like five minutes of your time

ELIZABETH
The walk to my car is three get to
the point

PERSISTENT MAN
Word on the hill is that the Gun
Lobby approached you to bury Heaton-
Harris And you refused

ELIZABETH
I don’t comment on ‘the word on the
hill’

PERSISTENT MAN
I know there’s no way you’d do
that Unless you support gun
control You know why you’re good
Liz Same reason Ayrton Senna was the
greatest auto racer of his time The
same reason terrorists are scary

ELIZABETH
I’m not sure a three-way comparison
between myself a dead race car
driver and Al-Qaeda is a good use of
your remaining hundred-and-thirty-
five seconds

PERSISTENT MAN
A terrorist will strap himself to a
bomb for his cause Senna believed
God was protecting him from harm so
he threw himself around corners
fully committed You won’t find a
mercenary on Earth willing to do
either You’re good because you
believe in your clients’ causes
conviction-lobbying And belief
motivates people in ways money just
can’t

ELIZABETH
I said ‘get to the point’-

PERSISTENT MAN
The Sloane Ranger sticking up for
corporate America against the thieves
on the hill clawing at hard-earned
profit to fund frivolities like
healthcare

Her ears prick up Her retort is instant and impassioned

ELIZABETH
Or because private property is the
foundation of civilized society I
object to any entity being forcibl
expropriated of the product of their
labor And you wanna talk about
frivolities those thieves on the
hill just spent nearly a million
dollars of someone’s hard labor
funding research into methane
emissions made by dairy cows
I accept a minimum rate of taxation
for necessities but a meddling all-
consuming government constricts
freedom throttles innovation and
subverts the free market All of
which destroy standards of living

PERSISTENT MAN
(shrugs nonplussed)
Personally I’m all for more gun
control Will you admit the present
system is unfit for purpose
ELIZABETH
I remain committed to the Second
Amendment

PERSISTENT MAN
Dildos are illegal in Texas but Joe
Public can walk into a sports store
and emerge five minutes later with a

shotgun

ELIZABETH
That would explain the low rate of
dildo-related murders in Texas

The Man LAUGHS heartily

ELIZABETH
It wasn’t that funny

PERSISTENT MAN

No but you just proved my point The
mere mention of taxation elicits a
libertarian polemic All I get from
gun control is a sarcastic
deflection You do support Heaton-
Harris and you abhor the tactics
your leadership would employ in
discrediting it

ELIZABETH
Alright You have unusual acuity for
a member of the DC press What do
you want

PERSISTENT MAN
Your quote

ELIZABETH
Fine a conviction-lobbyist never
cheats she exposes cheaters

He scribbles on a notepad

PERSISTENT MAN
That’s a keeper One more thing - off
the record - d’you know anything
about the Gun Lobby’s opponents

ELIZABETH

What Brady I know they’re going to
lose because their total budget comes
to less than what the Gun Lobby pay
to get their shoes shined-

PERSISTENT MAN

What about their lobbyists Peterson
Wyatt They’re a boutique law firm
with a bi-partisan Government Affairs
division-

ELIZABETH
‘Boutique’ is a euphemism for ‘little
fish’ and ‘bi-partisan’ denotes a
bunch of hippies in suits some of
whom are mercenary enough to swing
right when times get hard

PERSISTENT MAN
D’you know anything about their
President Guy named Schmidt

ELIZABETH
Never heard of him But if the firm
is built in his image he’s probably
a simpering wuss with a PhD in style-
over-substance

PERSISTENT MAN
Got it
(beat)
I never introduced myself by the
way Rodolfo Schmidt President of
Peterson Wyatt

Elizabeth stops She is for once speechless

RODOLFO SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
What’s the matter Am I not simpering
hard enough

ELIZABETH
(thinking out loud)
Your firm’s only twelve years old
youd think your name would either be
Peterson or -
(snaps out)
What’s this about

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Youre pro-Heaton-Harris and it’s an
Open secret youre at war with your
firm’s leadership

(beat)

The Brady Campaign want you to lead
the fight to pass the bill Peterson
Wyatt will employ you as a
consultant you’ll run defense out of
our office and when it’s over you’re
free to choose from any of the DC
behemoths in line for your signature
This is their quote

He writes down a number we don’t see and tears off the piece
of paper he scribbled on earlier She regards it with a smirk
now wise to his strategy

ELIZABETH
(re offer)
I don’t know if I should be flattered
or insulted Mr Schmidt but you
clearly have the wrong opinion of me
Especially considering the battle
youve got ahead of you

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
I think my opinion of you is spot-on

His earnestness halts any immediate retort from her She
studies him

RODOLFO SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Don’t even think about telling me you
don’t wanna take a swing at this
Maybe you’re the only one in this
town who can pull it off Anyway
it’s on the table I’ve overspent my
three minutes

Rodolfo walks off but turns back -

RODOLFO SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
Where’s your car

Long pause Elizabeth motions back down the street from where
they came

ELIZABETH
Three blocks that way

she closes the door Considers the milk

Elizabeth carefully sets down a saucer full of milk on her
front doorstep Takes a wistful look around the posh peaceful
neighborhood The pervasive stillness a touch unsettling

INT ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER - PAST

Elizabeth sits in an armchair and leans forward Her eyes dart
around the room she fidgets unable to turn her brain off

As if deciding to stop thinking once and for all she leans
back closes her eyes and ceases all movement Deep breaths
an attempt to induce sleep

It’s no use She snaps out of it quickly turns on a lamp and
snatches a book next to her - John Grishams The Litigators
Starts reading from her bookmark (she’s not far in) but
discards it in no time She’s wired An idea has taken hold

On hearing a faint MEOW Elizabeth glances out the front
window A stray cat and two kittens lick the milk she set out
Elizabeth lets out a SIGH as if this provides her some small
measure of comfort She catches her reflection in the window
Ruffled and sleepless

She removes something from her pocket - the torn-off SHEET OF
A NOTEPAD given to her by Rodolfo Schmidt She considers it -
then grabs her cell and makes a call

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
Jane hi -- I know what time it is
just listen I had a thought So

is it that anyone has ever heard of

Yes
ELIZABETH

OK make the bookings Cover it out
of the pooled account

New fish Franklin is within earshot

FRANKLIN
Is that OK Technically I mean

ELIZABETH
It’s fine Don’t worry about it

FRANKLIN

It’s just - the Kenyan government are
paying for this right That’s how we
get around the gift ban The pooled
account’s well Pooled There’s
money in there from the FandB
Association Wal-Mart anyone with an
interest in selling anything with
palm oil in it

(off their surprise)
I majored in Finance I go over
accounts when I want to look busy-

ELIZABETH
So you’ll know the Kenyans’
contribution to that account is big
enough to cover Senator Davis’
expenses ten times over and have
change for a small Caribbean island
Do I look unduly concerned

FRANKLIN
OK

Connors steams in wolfing down a chocolate muffin
CONNORS
George told me what happened with the
Gun Lobby are you retarded

ELIZABETH
No but coming from someone who just
walked in an hour late looking like
he pulled his face out of a cow pie
that’s mildly amusing

CONNORS
That wasn’t funny and I don’t get it

ELIZABETH
Pray tell why are you eating a
chocolate cake for breakfast Have
you no shame

CONNORS
It’s a muffin you never ate a muffin
for breakfast

ELIZABETH
A muffin let me see Eggs flour
sugar cocoa powder milk chocolate
Sounds exactly like a cake but of
course no civilized person could ever
eat chocolate cake for breakfast So
some bright spark in marketing
divvied up yesterday’s leftovers re-
branded them as ‘muffins’ and started
hawking them as breakfast food

CONNORS
Youve lost your mind-

ELIZABETH
Franklin are you getting this
‘Cause I’m really talking to you

FRANKLIN
Huh

ELIZABETH
Shmallow Cakes aren’t really cakes
They’re marshmallow paste sandwiched
between two biscuits covered in
chocolate America’s fourth favorite
snack is 80 graham cracker And
while our ever-rational tax code
deems cakes luxury items and hits
them harder biscuits are obviously
necessities and exempt Are you
getting this

FRANKLIN
What

ELIZABETH
Have Shmallow Cakes re-designated as
biscuits argue the ‘cake’ in the
name is merely marketing puff

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
You’1l need evidence in court so
have a team of scientists chemically
analyze their composition and opine
they are in fact 80 biscuit and zero
percent cake That’s how you win

FRANKLIN
You knew that all along

ELIZABETH
Youd have got there eventually

FRANKLIN
Then why are you telling me this

ELIZABETH
In case you’re not coming with me

CONNORS
What the hell’s going on

ELIZABETH

Everybody listen up As you may have
heard I took a meeting with the Gun
Lobby a week ago and advised them to
support the Heaton-Harris Amendment

(deep breath)
Effective immediately I’ve decided
to leave Cole Kravitz and Waterman
and take up station as a consultant
for the Brady Campaign at Peterson

In negotiating terms I secured
places on my team for everyone in

current rates of compensation Now

CONNORS
I just walked in an hour late ‘cause
I’ve been assuring the Gun Lobby that

respectfully decline to answer your

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING

You see it’s bad enough one person
having that much influence but if
they’re out of control - if she has a
problem an addiction Which
recludes her from exerting her
influence even-handedly It’d be
like the ship of American politics
being steered by a drunk Do you or
have you ever had any problems with
substance abuse Ms Sloane

Elizabeth’s eyes narrow Unsure what he’s getting at

ELIZABETH
(sharply)
Upon the advice of counsel I must

I understand you have difficulty
sleeping We subpoenaed medical
records you’re a long-time sufferer
of chronic insomnia You regularly
work over sixteen hours a day So you
suffer from a lot of fatigue but
can’t get off to sleep is that
accurate

aims a venomous stare at George Dupont knowing him to be the

bows his head She’s blown it

(fast and angry)
My medication doesn’t affect my
judgment any more than a double
espresso and speaking of
intoxication I can recite from
memory a list of ‘upstanding
democratically elected’ Congressmen
who have voted on legislation while
severely inebriated And just so you
know I think by now everyone in
this room is fully aware and in no
danger of forgetting that Kenya is a
republic which happens to be situated
on the continent of Africa

A long pause All eyes all cameras on Elizabeth She
deflates a little the consequences of that outburst now
weighing on her mind

being in Africa can’t you see that
whole construct was designed to --

ELIZABETH
You want to tell me what five years
is

POSNER

You fell for it The smartest
operative on the hill just got played
by Grampa Simpson

ELIZABETH
Is it how long this recess will feel
like

POSNER

It’s the going rate for perjury
before Congress Which now that
youve thrown the Fifth out the
window anyone who wants you in the
ground - and that’s a lot of people -
they’re hard at work dedicating the
sum total of their creative and
intellectual efforts to catch you in
a lie

ELIZABETH
What if I stay silent

POSNER
Well that’s a good idea Shit why
didn’t your lawyer think of that

ELIZABETH
If I simply refuse to answer-

POSNER
They’11 throw you in jail for
contempt of Congress Youve just
blown this thing wide open

He paces agitated Elizabeth looks at him smiles

ELIZABETH
Easy Daniel You’re starting to look
like you care

POSNER

I don’t care about you any further
than I can throw you I work for the
one ethical lobbying practice on the
hill and I wind up defending the
poster-child for the most morally
bankrupt profession since faith

weird It wouldn’t dispense my

I guess that’s for them to decide
after all it is you know their

slashing and burning pumps into the

ROSS
Less than 02 of global greenhouse
gas emissions Would you like to know
by how many orders of magnitude the

off all that Nutella

round the room and introducing our-

ELIZABETH

Let’s spare ourselves the tedium and
get to it If you want to break the
ice do it with insight Whatever our
differences political or otherwise
were all here to ensure safe passage
of the Heaton-Harris Amendment into
Federal law How do we do it

A brief silence

ESME
Realistically we don’t We fight
them as hard as we can build a
strong base of support so we have a
better chance when they table next
year’s Heaton-Harris or the one
after that

ELIZABETH
While I appreciate your pragmatism I
didn’t just move across town with the
aim of losing as slowly as possible
Name and seniority

ESME
Esme Manucharian nine years

ELIZABETH
Manucharian I’ve heard that name

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Esme’s our authority on gun control
When it comes to facts and figures
she has no equal

Ross’ note scribbling practically does a record scratch That
needles him

ELIZABETH
You led the fight to preserve the
concealed carry ban in Illinois

ESME
Ultimately unsuccessfully but yes

ELIZABETH
Esme Why are we going to lose

ESME
For every dollar we can donate in
campaign contributions you know how
much the Gun Lobby can donate

ROSS ESME
Thirty-eight Thirty-eight

ELIZABETH
(grins at rivalry)
So Congressmen bow to money but why
It’s not going into their own
accounts that’d be bribery

CYNTHIA
Like what the Kenyans just did to
Senator Davis

ELIZABETH

That was legal sovereign-backed
bribery but yes

(beat)
Every rational entity protects their
interests The priority of a
Congressman isn’t representing the
people it’s keeping his ass in
office Campaign contributions are a
means to that end which is why
Congressmen sell their votes to get
them

CYNTHIA
That is so cynical

ELIZABETH
There is no cynicism Only a word
used by Polly-Annas to denote an
absence of the naivety they so keenly
exhibit

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
(to Elizabeth)
You settle in fast

ALEX
So Congressmen bow to money so they
can get re-elected and we’re shit
out of money

CLARA
So we do it the old-fashioned way by
direct appeal to voters

Elizabeth regards Clara with a fleeting glance But still more
than any one person (bar Esme) has received from her

ELIZABETH
Thank you The average lobbying fight
is won rather plainly greasing the
right Congressmen at the right
moments

Congressmen thinks a vote against

betray the Gun Lobby to save his ass
even if they funded surgery to whiten
his teeth

RODOLFO SCHMIDT

price of an average ticket This is
your attempt at being normal

ELIZABETH
We can talk shop in relative privacy
I’m compromising

ESME
However much we spend to get the
public on our side the Gun Lobby can
afford to drown us out

ELIZABETH
And here’s the beauty of it the
reason we have any chance at all we
don’t need to spend to get the public
on our side They already are There
are 40000 people in this stadium
Polls show that 32000 of them favor
gun control just not vehemently
enough to change their vote over it
and further objurgate the painfully-
obscure language of the Second
Amendment

FRANKLIN
So we spend to make gun control the
deal-breaker

ELIZABETH
Exactly America has endured 31
school shootings since Columbine
more than double the amount in the
rest of the world put together Yes
Franklin We make guns a deal-
breaker We start a movement build a
consensus do everything we can to
make it snowball That’s how we win

ROSS
This is moot but just so you know
baseball isn’t America’s favorite
pastime anymore Statistically I
mean The NFL has polled-

ELIZABETH
I already knew that and it’s not
moot The NFL season kicks off little
over a month before Heaton-Harris
goes to vote Average attendance of
67000 tens of millions watching on
TV

The romantic music has the effect of making Elizabeth more
aggressive

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

This is where Jane and Joe reside I
want pro-Heaton-Harris ads on the big
screen I want TV spots the public
don’t pay heed to politicians they
listen to their heroes We get hold

Alex grabs Clara and pulls her close in front of him tilts
his head to the right From the camera view on the giant

his eyes and expertly caresses her cheek with his fingertips

JANE
Patterson

CONNORS
Huh

JANE

Their name The Patterson family

CONNORS
I don’t give a shit if they were the
Partridge Family She’s revived this

JANE
Actually she’s cultivated it Public
support for gun control’s up 8 in
the last two weeks alone Wickman’s
avoiding the Gun Lobby ‘cause if he
gives them what they want there’s a
very real chance he won’t make it
through fall

RM DUTTON
Why didn’t we close him earlier

CONNORS
It’s Wisconsin it’s not exactly
Where is she now

INT PETERSON WYATT - STRATEGY ROOM - DAY - PAST

The team hard at work making calls crunching numbers

An entire wall is dedicated to bio mugshots of Congressmen
with red slashes over some and green ticks over others Some
have no markings This is their vote count

Ross stands and admires it with Cynthia Franklin and Esme

ROSS
217’s the magic number 217 gets us a
majority-

CYNTHIA

I thought 218 is a majority-

ESME
(cutting in)
In a House of 435 it is but three
vacant seats gives us 432 meaning
217-215 is the smallest possible
winning majority

ROSS
As I Was Saying
(eyeing Esme)
By my reckoning the Gun Lobby has
191 votes pretty much locked -
(motions to wall)
That’s this side I’d say we have 183
locked over on this side That leaves
58 who are in play these fine
gentlemen in the middle Heaton-
Harris provisionally makes it to the
floor in 179 days
(MORE )
ROSS (CONTD)
The good news is if we lock down 34
of these money-sucking leeches were
over the line

FRANKLIN
The bad news being that the Gun Lobby
are rich beyond our wildest dreams

ROSS
There is that-

CYNTHIA

Or that it’s not a whole lot of time
to steal 34 votes from the most
powerful lobby in Dc

ROSS

That too-

ESME
What Ross is fumbling around is they
only need 26

ROSS
(finally)
Yes

Elizabeth marches through the office on the phone

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
No we need the media there that’s
the whole point It has to be
recorded on celluloid ready to be
trotted out should he ever think
about backing down - hold on -

(calling out)

Ross You get it

ROSS
Yeah Twelve billion a year 32 per
gun in circulation

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
OK good I’m sending you a photo of
Clara Thomson she’ll be seated front-
left wearing -
(calls out)
Clara what are you wearing

CLARA
One-shoulder black crepe dress

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
A one-shoulder black crepe dress If
youre really lucky she’1ll find you
at the reception Thank you Carlos

She hangs up To Alex passing by -

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Alex tell me it’s feasible that a
doctor wouldn’t have time for all
this social media lark

ALEX
If you’re pulling fifteen-hour
shifts I guess

ELIZABETH
Great

ALEX
Linked In If he’s a doctor he’d
probably be on Linked In

ELIZABETH
Could you not have just stopped when
I said ‘great’

She collapses into a chair and snatches up a medical text
titled PULMONARY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Rodolfo Schmidt passes

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Light reading

ELIZABETH
D’you even know what Pulmonology is

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
It’s the study of Pulmon

ELIZABETH
Did you know your lungs are
asymmetrical Your right lung has
three lobes but your left is
smaller it has two You know why

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Your heart needs the real estate

ELIZABETH
Bravo

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Though I guess that’s not a problem
for you

ELIZABETH
Ouch that hurt Come what do they
got Let’s have it

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
(consults notes)
It’s the first step toward a national
register of firearms

ELIZABETH
Nobody’s even come close to proposing
that and if anyone did it’d have
its own day in Congress Linking that
to Heaton-Harris is scare mongering

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
The new rules will increase wait
times by as long as two weeks

ELIZABETH
Two whole weeks how will they
survive

(MORE )

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Welcome to America where you’1l wait
six months for a routine operation
but hey you can buy an AR-15 in five
minutes flat

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Anderson Coopers earliest booking is
late-May You going to be that
flippant on CNN

ELIZABETH
Yes Pussyfooting isn’t memorable
Sound bites are and the appropriate
one here goes like this anyone that
desperate to get their hands on a gun
shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near
one

INT FIVE-STAR HOTEL - NIGHT - PAST

The ballroom is decked out for a big fundraiser Banners for
the AMA (American Medical Association) adorn the podium as
CONGRESSMAN WALLACE gives a speech

Clara wearing a black one-shoulder crepe dress weaves her
way through tables while on the phone

CLARA (INTO PHONE)
You think he’ll go for it

OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM Elizabeth paces on her cell

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
He knows the media is here and won’t
risk being heckled at his own
fundraiser You’1ll back him into a
corner and he’1l have no choice

LATER - Congressman Wallace stands on the platform and the
roving MC selects people to ask questions

MC
Just a couple more questions for the
Congressman and we’1ll wrap up

Clara’s hand shoots up The MC sees her but his glance moves
further afield

MC (CONTD)
Yes the lady in white

Clara puts her cell phone to her ear The unseen lady in white
has a bland scripted Q and A with the Congressman

CLARA (INTO PHONE)
He was supposed to go to me third
what’s he doing

ELIZABETH (0S FILTERED)
Following orders Three tables behind
you four to your left

Clara looks back Connors RM Dutton Jane and Ramirez
share a table Connors catches her gaze She looks away

ELIZABETH (0S FILTERED) (CONTD)
Theyve been following us since
Wisconsin They’d have had everyone
on that list vetted You’re blown

CLARA (INTO PHONE)
You made me delete my Facebook
account I had my bio removed from
our website-

ELIZABETH (0S FILTERED)
To make it look like we tried

CLARA (INTO PHONE)
What d’you mean

MC
And the final question goes to

Clara’s hand shoots up again but the MC reads from a card

MC (CONTD)

Dr Raj Amarasekara - I hope I’m
pronouncing that right - of the

Pulmonary Associates of America

RAJ AMARASEKARA stands to pose his question

RAJ AMARASEKARA
Mr Congressman Where I work on any
given night it’s a safe bet we’1ll
see three or four gunshot victims
Some are kids teenagers I think we
can all agree this is a problem so
Id like you to tell us how you
intend to vote on the Heaton-Harris
Amendment when it’s put before
Congress Thank you

The question receives LOUD APPLAUSE from the audience You can
tell the press in the room because they just scrambled for
their cameras and phones and proceed to record the moment

ON ELIZABETH inconspicuous towards the back on the phone

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE )
I mean Raj Amarasekara is a working
actor whose real name is Matthew
Kantaria They thought he was about
to ask a benign question about a
clean air initiative

Connors is steaming mad RM Dutton death cooled down
The Congressman does his best to conceal his unease Pause

CLARA (INTO PHONE)
You decoyed me

ELIZABETH (0OS FILTERED)
Raj Amarasekara has personally
plagiarized seven research papers
all available online He even has a
Linked In account

CONGRESSMAN WALLACE
Well As you said and have
experienced gun violence is a real
problem And while our sympathies
must always be first and foremost
with the families of the victims it
must also be noted the enormous
strain gun violence puts on our
healthcare system
(uneasy pause in a bind)
That’s why when put to vote I
will whole-heartedly support the
Heaton-Harris Amendment

LOUD APPLAUSE Congressman Wallace puts on his best plastic
smile and laps it up but behind it lurks one angry man

Elizabeth surveys a sea of camera phones held up by attendees
which just captured the moment

ELIZABETH
(to herself)
And that’s a wrap

She turns on a sixpence to exit but stops - she catches
Jane’s gaze from across the room Her old protégé now an
adversary Neither dwells on it - Elizabeth strides out Jane
sips her drink casually

BACK IN THE OFFICE CLOSE-UP ON THE VOTE COUNT Congressman
Wallace’s face gets a BIG GREEN TICK stuck over it

INT LUXURY HOTEL - ROOM 409 - NIGHT - PAST

Elizabeth rolls off Forde in bed post-coital They stare at
the ceiling It takes a moment for her breathing to normalize
but when it does

ELIZABETH
I could use this room tonight I have
work to do

She gets out of bed and dresses Forde rolls onto his side

FORDE
Big case

ELIZABETH
Forde human interaction is an
exchange My money for your

FORDE
(sotto voce)

Dick
ELIZABETH

Let’s call it “skill set” - is the

only exchange I’m willing to make
FORDE

Now ya sound like a banker

(beat)
I was hopin’ we could getta know each
other a li’l
(MORE )

FORDE (CONTD)
If you ever need an excuse to get
outta the office or wherever it is
you work Id be happy to meet
downtown for a cup of Joe Just as
two normal people Not you know

ELIZABETH
(smiles )
While I admire your persistence
that’s never going to happen

FORDE
Suit y’erself
(rolls out of bed)
I got prep to do anyways

ELIZABETH
Prep for what

FORDE
(dressing)
‘Nother client tomorrow night

A flash of irrational disappointment registers on Elizabeths
face upon being reminded that Forde sees other women

ELIZABETH
You do prep

FORDE
For functions Believe it or not not
everyone hires me for my “skill set”
Half my clients only want me on their
arm Some just wanna sit ‘n talk to
someone from a different neck’a the
woods who ain’t gonna judge ‘em

ELIZABETH
Dear God that’s pathetic

FORDE

Functions are different I gotta be
in character

(disdainful)
The agency gave me a list’a covers
‘cause God forbid I go as a country
boy who came to town as a PT
Insurance exec marketin’ guy
Tomorrow oil ‘n gas

We get a strong sense that Forde loathes this deceptive aspect
to his work

He is dressed and ready to go Elizabeth digs an envelope out
of her handbag and offers it to him His bitterness
evaporates and he’s back to his playful self

ELIZABETH
Ill be seeing you

FORDE
I think you owe me somethin’ more

ELIZABETH
It’s all there Count it

FORDE
This covers my services But I just
gave ya a whole lotta info ‘bout my
line’a work On your principles of
exchange

He motions for her to reciprocate

ELIZABETH
That was more of a voluntary donation
on your part

FORDE
You a real enigma ya know that
Nothin’ like the typical client

ELIZABETH
Old

FORDE
Strong You ain’t here to live out
some bizarro fantasy ‘bout bein’ a
master or a slave You’re here for
somethin’ else

Elizabeth regards him ambivalence subdued behind her
reflective gaze

ELIZABETH
You asked me once what brought me to
this room I guess I’m playing a role
too I pay you so I can imagine a
life I chose to forego in pursuit of
my career

FORDE
Why imagine it when ya could just go
out‘n get it

The question strikes a chord with Elizabeth She hardens
becomes defensive

ELIZABETH
No it’s not for me Not when I was
in my twenties and sure as hell not
now

FORDE
So no house ya call home no folks ya
call family sorta thing huh Ever
regret that choice

ELIZABETH
Not for a second

Forde lets that settle Peers into her unreadable expression
FORDE

Well least now we’re peelin’ a
layer

ELIZABETH
(beat)
And that is all my “principles of
exchange” will transact Goodbye
Forde

FORDE
Bye Nothin’

Forde smiles and takes his leave

All business again Elizabeth shuffles through some documents
she’s taken out of her Bottega Veneta briefcase She stops
sets down the file She sits on the edge of the unkempt bed
Now still and silent Mind distant

EXT PINEHURST GOLF COURSE (N CAROLINA)- GREEN - DAY - PAST

Connors lines up a putt on the green as Bob Sandford and
CONGRESSMAN BURNS (50s even-tempered businessman-turned-
politico) look on intently

Connors steadies himself and sinks a fifteen yard putt
nerveless He pumps his fist exhilarated by victory

CONNORS
Fucking A right

His two rivals applaud ruefully They all shake hands

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
And there I thought lobbyist
etiquette forbids you from beating
your client much less a Congressman
You don’t get to our heart by
damaging our fragile egos

BOB SANDFORD
Ill tell you Frank this one here
plays by his own rules

EXT PINEHURST GOLF COURSE (N CAROLINA) - LODGE - DAY - PAST

The three now enjoy scotch and a breathtaking view

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
I’m a little surprised you even made
it out here The public swings well
in favor of gun control and I’m an
the enviable position of financial
independence

BOB SANDFORD
Were well aware Frank

CONGRESSMAN BURNS

I know it may be unusual for a
lobbyist to hear but when I pledged
not to accept campaign finance from
the Gun Lobby I meant front and back
door

CONNORS

We’re not offering finance I know
your approval rating’s sky-high
(MORE )

CONNORS (CONTD)
You could practically vote for Sharia
law and you’d still keep your seat I
also know you’re an old school
patriot who cares about the future of
America About what America stands
for

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
There’s nothing wrong with exercising
vigilance over who gets their hands
on a firearm

CONNORS
Tell me Congressman When I say
‘America’ what’s the first word you
think of

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
(knowing nod)
Freedom

CONNORS
Yeah It’s in our DNA And every time
this Big Brother nanny-state makes a
new incursion into citizens’
freedoms it dilutes what makes this
country great Self-sufficiency is
celebrated here You started with
nothing and made a fortune buying and
leasing aircraft try doing that in
Europe Everyone in this great nation
of ours has it in their power to
succeed by their own hand and
everyone has the right to defend
what’s theirs

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
Some incursions into freedom might be
necessary Heaton-Harris isn’t the
end of gun rights

CONNORS
No but it’s a continuation of a
culture of erosion Slowly they’re
taking more and more - slow enough so
we won’t really feel it over the
course of our lifetimes But ina
hundred two hundred years what’11
be left of the Second Amendment

Connors’ passion is manifest and genuine Sandford regards him
proudly sipping his scotch and nodding to arguments he
doesn’t have the cogency to enunciate

CONNORS (CONTD)
I know you’re not a religious man so
let me put it in evolutionary terms
Fish became amphibians then
reptiles all the way through
primates and then humans A monkey
didn’t one day give birth to a human
baby But with a series of tiny
imperceptible changes over millions
of years what started as a fish
became something completely
different

(MORE)

CONNORS (CONT’D)
Sure Heaton-Harris doesn’t change
much on its own But the cumulative
effect of a series of incursions will
turn the Second Amendment into
something very different to what our
Founders intended Same goes for all
of our freedoms Hell I’m not here
because I love guns honestly I
don’t I do love freedom

CONGRESSMAN BURNS
Is that not evolution

CONNORS

Evolution isn’t necessarily positive
Not when we stand to lose one of the
things that makes it great to be
American the right to refuse to be a
victim

Congressman Burns sighs looks out at the resplendent fairway
thinking hard Opening up

EXT CLUB HOUSE (N CAROLINA) - DAY - PAST

Connors walks with Bob Sandford towards a luxury sedan which
has pulled up out front of the club house

BOB SANDFORD
I never had a great amount of respect
for freelance outfits like you
Always figured you’re ready to piss
whichever way the wind’s blowing to
make a buck - that’s why I wanted
Sloane But seeing you at work just
now You really believed what you
were saying

CONNORS
(firm)
I do Unshakably
BOB SANDFORD
(beat)
Then I’m glad Sloane said No She did
me one helluva favor
He offers his hand to Connors who shakes it vigorously

BOB SANDFORD (CONTD)

Connors nods Those words meant the world to him Sandford
gets in the back seat and the car pulls out

If you were donating that much why
would you do it anonymously

What No It makes you look noble
when you leak your identity

EXTINT GRAND PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY - PAST

Clara keeps pace with Elizabeth as they quick-step up the
stone staircase into the airy and imposing public building

CLARA
I deleted every vestige of my online
existence-

ELIZABETH
And you didn’t replace it leaving a
Clara-sized hole in Google which
they obviously flagged when they were
doing their due diligence Why’d we
lose Burns

CLARA

I did replace it First hit on Clara
Thomson gets you a Canadian English

teacher in South Korea but I made a
small footprint two rungs down I’d

just returned from a two-year stint

with Medcins Sans Frontiers It was

solid

ELIZABETH
What can I say They’re good Burns
North Carolina What the hell

happened

CLARA

There’s ten of us How many d’you
think we’re up against at Waterman
Thirty We don’t have the manpower
nor the funding to keep up with the
Lobby and we just hadn’t gotten to
him yet They got lucky and picked
one who was wide open

Elizabeth grimaces knowing her point is valid

CLARA (CONTD)
Unless of course it wasn’t luck

ELIZABETH
What d’you mean

CLARA
You didn’t tell me about Raj Ama

ELIZABETH
Amarasekara Just call him Matthew

CLARA
I checked with Finance he wasn’t
paid from the firm’s account You ran
him out of your own pocket

ELIZABETH
It’s good practice to keep your
circle small I needed you sharp with
the question in case you slipped
through their net I had nothing to
gain by telling you

CLARA
But you had something to lose You
think we might have a leak

ELIZABETH

Clara 25 years in this industry has
taught me it’s always best to assume
that in this town no matter where
you are you’re never more than two
meters away from a rat

Clara’s pace fades trying to process if there was an
implication being made there Elizabeth strides into --

The vast main reading room of the world’s biggest library
Giant marble columns bronze statues set high up in the
balustrades and the centerpiece - sunlight seeping through
arch windows beneath a huge ornate dome

The other eight members of the team work at a reading table
Some have laptops others scribble on notepads Elizabeth and
Clara take their places Throughout Clara taps away on her
laptop as if taking notes not fully invested in the
conversation

LAUREN
(to Elizabeth)
Why are we meeting in a library

ESME
Illinois has six Republicans in the
House a little of this money would
go a long way to-

ELIZABETH
OK stop

CYNTHIA
We need to make up 25 votes I was
thinking we contribute to Russell
Stefanovic-

ALEX
Screw contributions we’d be toe-to-
toe with the Lobby and we’d lose

ELIZABETH
I said stop

ON CLARAS LAPTOP SCREEN she sets up a new Facebook account

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Tell me you haven’t already spent it

ELIZABETH
We’re gonna take this money and use
it to send a message We’re going to
swing a state we have absolutely no
right to swing

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Please God don’t say

ELIZABETH

turning point

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
You’re aware that America now calls
Florida “The Gunshine State”

thought you’d approve

ELIZABETH
Out the door

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
(in jest)
Serves me right for hiring a woman

ELIZABETH
Sexism from a Democrat well I never

Almost as shocking as you being
optimistic

sleeps at a table nowhere near us A few TOURISTS walk around
the outskirts snap photos mesmerized by the giant dome

town

Correct This is where Mr and Mrs
Public do not reside We’re reading
fewer books than ever Persuasion

consumed by her laptop She eventually looks up at Elizabeth

techniques of commercial advertisers
from 1957-

today’s world of i-nonsense

Clara’s attention is distracted by something on her SCREEN a
friend request from ALEX DE JONG The message reads

Welcome back to civilization )

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

As you all know good marketing
burrows insidiously into your
target’s brain and results in action
for example buying a Big Mac

Clara glances to Alex his laptop open in front of him He
gives her a smile knowing she got the request Clara notices
Elizabeth eyeing them and she expertly recovers

CLARA
Our phone pitch has to “burrow
insidiously into Floridian brains”

ELIZABETH
Yes And so too your ad banners They
must burrow so deep your targets are
inspired to flood their elected
official with pro-Heaton-Harris
letters and use those delightful
social networks to implore their
friends to do likewise Now read the
exposé and take to the media-verse

CLARA
Good thing I’m back on Facebook

Clara didn’t do much to mask her supercilious tone Alex
closes his laptop and gets up a little smirk on his face
It’s not lost on Clara

ELIZABETH
Super Their pompous shareholders can
breathe again

CLARA
It’s a public company

crosses items off a checklist while Elizabeth talks to
HARRISON (60s) a long-time ally

POSNER
(to Elizabeth)
Tax avoidance Any offshore bank
accounts undeclared income

ELIZABETH
No

Posner crosses it off He does this with every new query

HARRISON
(to Elizabeth)
Look if I’m interrupting I can-

ELIZABETH
Not at all What can I do for you
Harrison

HARRISON
There’s no more you could possibly do
for me Liz Look there’s no easy
way to say this-

ELIZABETH
Oh thank God

HARRISON
What

ELIZABETH

You’ve come to your senses You’re
going to publicly flog me and about
time too

HARRISON
I was going to use the term “distance
ourselves”
ELIZABETH
Where’s the fun in that
HARRISON
I have shareholders to think about
From a PR standpoint You
ELIZABETH

Stop fumbling for a euphemism
Harrison I’m so toxic I glow in the
dark You’re doing absolutely the
right thing and you’ve nothing to
apologize for

Elizabeth reaches into a folder pulls out a stack of papers

POSNER
(to Elizabeth)
Recreational drug use

ELIZABETH

(to Posner)
No

(to Harrison)
See these Cards and letters of
apology from clients who felt they
had to do the same for the sake of
their business Your corporate
spokesman will denounce me in the
strongest possible terms I didn’t
help get you where you are only to
see you tarnished by this nonsense

HARRISON
This sucks

ELIZABETH
In your personal capacity as my
friend yes But you’re not
denouncing me as my friend you’re
denouncing me as CEO of Harper’s
who’s duty-bound to act in the best
interests of his company And right
now that entails running from me as
fast as you can screaming evil

HARRISON
Youll get through this

At that moment Harrison goes to hug Elizabeth She’s taken by
surprise and panic flashes across her face for a fraction of
a second She meets his embrace awkwardly but begins to lean
into it She closes her eyes enjoying a fleeting moment of
release from the stress of her predicament

The moment lasts a second too long and Posner can’t help but
observe a side to Elizabeth he never knew existed

Harrison smiles at her warmly nods goodbye and exits

POSNER
Never I mean on the drug use

ELIZABETH
(sarcastic)
Oh I thought you were just talking
about this morning No never

Posner sets down his pen and removes glasses from strained
eyes He takes a moment to regard Elizabeth who fastidiously
straightens papers on the desk to regain her composure

POSNER
I can’t believe you’re OK with your
most loyal client stomping on you

ELIZABETH

He should have done it weeks ago
POSNER

Why don’t you quit This place
ELIZABETH

Sorry
POSNER

I’ve known you long enough now to
surmise your feelings toward this
city Sitting in that hearing
listening to them go over your
medical records

ELIZABETH

(stops long pause)
I wanted to But I cant I can’t
imagine what in the world I would do
I’ve been reading The Litigators for
the last two years I haven’t made it
past a hundred pages I’ve gone
through eleven doctors they all want
rid of me for ignoring their
exhortations to slow down I want to
slow down But this job is the only
means I have of making myself useful

She rests against the desk stares reflectively upon the DC
cityscape beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Did you know ideology is dead The
philosophies of the left and right
are driven by the self-interest of
those who advance them

Elizabeth turns back to Posner a wistful sadness lingering
behind her tired eyes

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Neither side cares for the merits of
their argument they just happen to
spout it because it suits their
position in the world

(MORE)

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
They’d switch in a heartbeat if a
millionaire lost everything or a
broke socialist won the lottery or
better still earned a fortune by
their own hand People have no real
ideology All their political
proclamations are governed solely by
self-interest

POSNER
That would include you

ELIZABETH

Behind all of my conscious brain’s
grandstanding I would think so I
don’t know why but part of me wishes
I hadn’t ever realized that

A meaningful silence overtakes the room They both gaze upon
the dusking sun Finally

POSNER
Happy birthday Elizabeth

Elizabeth gently swivels her neck to face him Takes in his
sincere expression A touch flattered he knew of the occasion

ELIZABETH
Thank you Daniel

She returns her rueful stare to the high-powered world
sprawled out beyond the glass And softly exhales

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
David Badgley Senator from Michigan
Came out in support months ago but
he just gave a quote saying now he
wants to “wait and see” His PAC
received twenty-five grand from the
Gun Lobby two weeks ago

ELIZABETH
A one-eighty

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
“Wait and see” were his words so
it’s really more like a ninety

ELIZABETH
We have him on celluloid pledging his
support

RODOLFO SCHMIDT

So we’ll just have to make him feel

experience the quickest way to bring
him in line is to mine for sordid
details and let him know we’re in

capable of

Standard 24-hour audio and video
surveillance cell phone and online

Little Sam reaches for a plastic container for a small pet
perhaps a lizard or a gerbil He pulls out a COCKROACH

LITTLE SAM

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
It’s a cockroach

BIG SAM
Yes It can be retro-fitted as a
cybernetic robo-roach with this

Big Sam holds up a tiny ‘electronic backpack’

BIG SAM
We glue electrodes to the legs
perforate its thorax and we can
control its movement remotely

ELIZABETH
Don’t call PETA Schmidt

Incorporated into the backpack is a

crevices bags cars undetected
They can go without food for weeks
and still be mobile

excavating these guys won’t take
long to get it

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
It’s mind-boggling ingenious and
completely unacceptable

ELIZABETH
Booooo

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
You’re talking about blackmailing a
member of Congress and I won’t
entertain it

ELIZABETH
You’re only here because I figured
you might say that

Now I appreciate that you often
employ more creative tactics - to
great effect I might add - and
without prejudice to the undoubtedly
stellar job you guys do Our firm

way

RODOLFO SCHMIDT (INTO PHONE) (CONTD)
I thought we agreed you’d focus on
the debate for just thirty minutes-

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
The Assault Weapons Ban is a vote-
winning ploy which sounds appealing
to the uninformed It’s Potemkin
legislation designed to help Rosen
keep his hand in the cookie jar It
doesn’t help people it helps him

RODOLFO SCHMIDT (INTO PHONE)
Banning assault weapons doesn’t help
people Say people who might
otherwise have been victims of
assault weapons

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
You rest my case on the ‘uninformed’
All guns are assault weapons the AWB
bans cosmetic features like pistol
grips I don’t remember too many gun
victims being beaten to death with a
telescoping stock The sum total of
the AWB is that it makes gun-wielding
lunatics look a little less scary as
they kill people

This is the latest incursion into
individual liberty by an all-powerful
federal government-

ELIZABETH
What like drivers’ licenses

CONNORS
Drivers’ licenses I’m not really
seeing the connection

ELIZABETH
It’s illegal to operate a car without
going through rigorous theoretical
and practical assessments that’s a
clear constraint on the freedom of
individuals to drive cars as with
pilots to fly planes

INT ANDERSON COOPER 360 - CONTINUOUS - PAST

ELIZABETH
Why they’re a government incursion
on individual liberty are they not
We accept them because they make
sense the more dangerous the
machinery the more rigorous the
tests should be We wouldn’t want
unfit drivers in cars any more than
novice pilots flying 747s because
dangerous machinery in the wrong
hands poses a threat to public

The Second Amendment was signed in a

fit inside the Orange Bowl

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
What may have been perfectly sensible
in those alien times is wholly
inadequate to solve the problems of
the present

CONNORS
The Constitution is the highest legal
document in the land it’s
unimpeachable and explicit ‘the
right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed’

ELIZABETH
Nothing is unimpeachable not even
the Constitution The clue lies in
the title of the very legislation
youre so quick to parrot

ANDERSON COOPER
Hold on Liz now that’s a very
forceful argument the wording of the
Second Amendment is explicit-

ELIZABETH
Really Do you find it forceful

ANDERSON COOPER
Well ah I’m just saying a lot of
people would-

ELIZABETH
Because I find it the weakest most
mind-numbing retort in their arsenal
sort of a last refuge for those with
no real argument at all-

CONNORS
You’re talking about the United
States Constitution-

ELIZABETH
And I can’t stand to see people hide
behind it just as they hide behind
the Bible to deny gay people rights
Literalists need to stop reciting
their sacred parchments and exercise
their brain power If they can
produce a rational winning argument
I’1l gladly migrate to their side
but ‘because it says so in the
Constitution the Bible or my
horoscope’ is not a winning argument
It’s a ripcord the intellectual
equivalent of a yellow pant-pissing
wimp cowering behind mommy’s skirt

Deathly silence Elizabeth and Connors eyeball each other

ANDERSON COOPER
OK time out We’re going for a
break and when we come back maybe
these two will stop playing so nice
and the gloves’ll really come off

going to make a big difference

ELIZABETH
Not really

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Really

ELIZABETH

America’s awash with guns They’re a

art of our culture that’s
irreversible But the stakes are such
that Heaton-Harris doesn’t need to
make a big difference If it keeps
one gun out of the hands of one
lunatic that could be the difference
between the life and death of an
innocent civilian And all our work
would have been worth it

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Did you know someone Someone who
was a victim of gun-

ELIZABETH
No why does everybody assume that
It’s insulting

RODOLFO SCHMIDT

see the merits of an argument when I
feel the effects personally

There was a Congressman I forget his
name - spent his entire career
opposing gay rights only to do a U-
turn when his brother came out How
absurd is that His whole life it’s
disgusting and he’s against it but
suddenly it’s OK because his brother
does it What a well-reasoned basis
for an opinion Quick someone give

Forde sits at the desk and looks out the window at the

She grabs a

look at her

FORDE
Youre Madeline Elizabeth Sloane You
work in government affairs at a
communications company

ELIZABETH
Well hooray for Google “Government
affairs” and “communications” are
just fancy words for lobbying The
only person to ever call me Madeline
was my mother

towel and dries her hair unperturbed

FORDE
What was that The other night You
pretended like we were strangers

ELIZABETH
In public we are

FORDE
We were alone-

ELIZABETH
In a room full of Washingtons
finest I can’t be associated with
you there at least one other person
knew the truth about you

It wasn’t intended but Forde is a little hurt by this

FORDE
Yeah I hear you lobbyists ain’t so
good with truth

ELIZABETH
Says who The man with four
identities who sleeps with strangers
for money

deluge

Elizabeth regrets that instantly There is a moment’s silence

as Forde is

again reminded of his status as a leper

FORDE
I work at my covers I was just
surprised how much of a natural you
are The way you just switched You
need to teach me how to do that

ELIZABETH
Decades of experience Forde
deception is an integral part of
social interaction The average man
lies six times a day women three

FORDE
So I experienced

ELIZABETH
So what’s the problem

FORDE
No problem I’m fine

ELIZABETH
You know you just uttered the most
common lie told by both sexes

FORDE
Alright It’s wrong Satisfied

ELIZABETH
That’s a little simplistic

FORDE
Guess I’m a simple guy

ELIZABETH
Why then do you lie for a living

FORDE
Pays the bills faster than showin’
“Washington’s finest” how to use a
stairmaster

ELIZABETH
There are degrees of wrongness
Immoral as a harmless lie may be it
may be perfectly moral to tella
hundred of them to prevent a truly
pernicious outcome Lies and half-
truths are a lobbyist’s stock in
trade But I’ve never deployed one
for a cause I didn’t believe in

FORDE
(defeated shrug beat)
So We gettin’ down to business or
what

Elizabeth hesitates Things have changed Her secret is out
and she no longer feels the need to be curt with him

ELIZABETH
Are you hungry I wouldn’t mind
Just ordering room service tonight

Forde looks at her intrigued He straightens out for the
first time with her feeling like he’s a respectable human and
not a support system for his manhood

LATER - Elizabeth and Forde sit over room service
FORDE
You once told me this was pathetic

ELIZABETH
If you were a total stranger it
would be

FORDE
Your line of work It’s all ‘bout
reputation right Nobody’s gonna cut
ya any slack if they got dirt on you

ELIZABETH
Dirt has been known to end careers in
this town yes

FORDE
(smiles )
I must be worth somethin’ You’re
takin’ quite a risk bein’ here

ELIZABETH

It would only be a risk if I didn’t
trust your discretion But I must
say I didn’t expect you to be quite
so Principled

Elizabeth chuckles to herself sarcastically

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
You know this is the closest I’ve
ever come to a date

FORDE
You never been on a date

ELIZABETH
I went about my business and got on
with my professional life I took the
view that if I ever stumbled upon it
Id explore it But I never sought it
out Nor did I ‘stumble upon it’ So
here we are

FORDE
What’d you do in college Don’t tell
me you were-

ELIZABETH
Studying which is after all the
objective of college

FORDE
Its fair to say you ‘n me had very
different objectives

Elizabeth adjusts her Patek Philippe watch regards it
Retreats inside herself for a softened beat

ELIZABETH
(slows down)
You know I’m not from money Quite
the opposite in fact Not many
people know that

FORDE
Can’t say I ever thought about it

ELIZABETH
When you’re growing up as an only
child and you and your single mother
sleep together on the floor ‘cause
she can’t afford a bed Let’s just
say it focuses you Distractions like
relationships pale into
insignificance

FORDE
You don’t get lonely

ELIZABETH
I’ve no time to get lonely Speaking
of which

Elizabeth reaches into her handbag and pulls out an envelope
Hands it to Forde He does not take it

FORDE
For what Tonight’s my night off

ELIZABETH
What d’you mean

FORDE
I didn’t work tonight I had dinner
with a friend As it would happen a
single female friend Maybe next
time we can get together for that
coffee ya were so quick to shoot
down

Elizabeth’s demeanor changes She withdraws becomes
defensive

ELIZABETH
No Don’t be ridiculous Take it

FORDE
Fair exchange without You got my
company I got yours

ELIZABETH
Damn it Forde take the fucking

money

He pauses Realizes she isn’t yet ready for this to be
personal Always business

INT PUBLIC BUS ILLINOIS - DUSK - PAST

Esme sits near the back among weary COMMUTERS after a hard
days work She taps at her phone robotically Nobody talks
Nobody even looks at anyone else

The bus stops and new passengers get on A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
gets up and offers his seat to a LADY who can’t be much older
than him

LADY
Oh I’m fine thanks

MIDDLE-AGED MAN
(looks down)
But for how much longer in those

She’s wearing a clunky pair of heels to his comfy Air Max 90s
Conceding the Lady smiles and takes a seat The Middle-Aged
Man steps closer to the front of the bus

Esme lowers her phone and rests her head softly against the
window She’s just closing her eyes when --

A SCUFFLE breaks out near the front of the bus Esme cranes
her neck to see what all the fuss is about --

AN ERRANT GUNSHOT RINGS OUT

People SCREAM Some hit the deck - some are thrown off-balance
as the bus SCREECHES to a halt

A guy with a BUZZ CUT (20s) barges his way through commuters -
in his hand - A FN HERSTAL 57 -

He’s on a beeline fixing his determined glare squarely ON
ESME - he strides with purpose right for her

She realizes and tries to scramble out of her seat -

Buzz Cut raises the gun -

He has a clean shot All he has to do is pull the trigg--
BANG BANG

Buzz Cut JOLTS forward hit twice in the back His FN Herstal
drops to the floor behind him skidding to a pair of firmly-
planted Air Max 90s BLOOD appears at the corner of his mouth
and he collapses dead
Behind him stands the Middle-Aged Man who offered his seat
stern expression behind a smoking Glock 9 Rock-solid stance
of someone who spends a lot of time at the firing range His
name is FRANK MCGILL

Like a pro he kicks the fallen FN Herstal out of Buzz Cut’s
reach Only then does he glance up

Esme is on the floor pressed up against a seat She shivers
in shock Her watered eyes meet the focused stare of her
savior

KIDS are at the breakfast table Connors has his phone to his
ear and is glued to a TV NEWS REPORT On the phone

CONNORS (INTO PHONE)
Yeah I’m getting it

REPORTER (VIA TV)
We understand the assailant was a
firearms enthusiast and was
targeting a leading figure in the gun
control movement who was traveling
as a passenger on the bus The
assailant was then shot dead himself
by a civilian passenger who was
carrying a registered concealed
firearm Two people were rushed to
hospital with non-life-threatening
injuries in an incident that could’ve
been much worse had this brave man
not

CONNORS (INTO PHONE)

some money

EXT STARVED ROCK STATE PARK (ILLINOIS) - DAY - PAST

A secluded spot that feels like a million miles from
civilization Sunlight filters through treetops and all that
can be heard is the electric BUZZ of cicadas

Esme sits on a bench She stares into space lifeless

She doesn’t so much as turn her head when Elizabeth sits next
to her softly Elizabeth sets down her carry-on clearly
fresh from a plane

The pair don’t look at each other for a while Elizabeth takes
her time here not her usual belligerent self

ELIZABETH
All the time I spend in the city
somehow I’m still more comfortable

here

ESME
When I was a kid we had a family get-
together We were sitting around

the table at breakfast talking about
what animal we’d be if we were
reincarnated Some said birds My
uncle wanted to be a hippo wallowing
in mud all day When my turn came I
thought I’d be clever I said
‘human’ Over the next twenty years
I slowly realized everyone else at
that table had already considered
that option and ruled it out

ELIZABETH
I had a look at your staff profile
Youre one of the most prominent anti-
gun campaigners in DC You went to
high school in Colorado in the late
‘90s The name of the school isn’t
stated

She hasn’t looked at her yet but Esme gives Elizabeth the
tiniest of nods to confirm her suspicion A long beat

ESME
I locked myself in a classroom and
hid under a desk I covered my ears
but it did nothing People were dying
outside I heard knocks on the door
I didn’t have it in me to even try to
help I couldn’t move I never
wanted to feel that way again

She gazes upon the verdant landscape her eyes moistening
composure weakening

ESME (CONT’D)
Yesterday Yesterday I felt the
exact same way I did when I was
eighteen I got very good at acting
tough but nothing changed
underneath Nothing really changes at
all

Elizabeth spends a moment digesting her words Her intonation
slower more considered here

ELIZABETH
You may find this hard to believe
but I’m no stranger to those
sentiments myself

ESME
You were involved in a shooting

ELIZABETH
(beat)
No But I spent much of my formative
years with my hands over my ears
trying and failing absolutely to
block out the sounds of my father
beating my mother

Esme looks at Elizabeth It’s the first time she’s ever heard
anything from her that isn’t work-related

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Eventually there came a point at
which I could no longer tolerate it
Brave or stupid one day when he got
violent I stood up to him When you
grow up in fear of someone they hold
a certain power over you that
subsists regardless of your age or
relative strength But that first
time at the age of fourteen That
was the hardest thing I’ve done by a
distance

ESME
- What happened

ELIZABETH
It took him by surprise The
immediate backlash for me wasnt
pretty

(MORE)

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
but he wasn’t so quick to get violent
the next time That stand changed
everything When he did take his
swings my mother and I stood up to
him together Ultimately it gave us
the confidence to run away from the
bastard and never look back It
wasn’t an inspiring ending by any
stretch but some battles believe it
or not are best won by turning your
back And some can only be won by not
backing down

Elizabeth regards Esme not as a subordinate or even a
colleague but more like a proud parent

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
It’s oh-so-easy to keep your mouth
shut and let it slide but you and I
both managed to find that courage
inside of us Especially you Esme
And when one person nails their
colors to the mast you’ll find that
others will be quick to follow
That’s how change happens

Esme retains her sense of despondency but on some level she
is buoyed by Elizabeth’s showing of respect

Moment over Esme is surrounded by colleagues updating her
and asking for her input Ross sidles up to her sheepishly

ROSS

Elizabeth looks at the intrepid faces of her small loyal
team Her exterior barely registers it but shes genuinely
touched and impressed

ELIZABETH

knives See you all first thing

After a beat they relent and take their exits Elizabeth
remains in her seat Rodolfo gives her a moment as she affixes
her stare on her young colleagues as they file out

ELIZABETH
We fight the good fight and hope for

She shakes her head and Rodolfo exits Elizabeth hesitates
Decisively she pulls out her cell and makes a call

It’s me

FEMALE VOICE (0S FILTERED)
I’m sorry you have the wrong number

ELIZABETH (INTO PHONE)
Silly me I should have written it
down

She hangs up and puts her phone away Savors the silence for
a moment She gropes in her handbag for the TRINKET BOX Flips
it open to reveal two little white pills Elizabeth stares at
them contemptuously Wants them but knows she shouldn’t

Jaw clenched in frustration Elizabeth gets up and stomps over
to a trash can heels stabbing the floor with every stride

Her hand hovers over the receptacle but wavers - she can’t

let go Until -- she drops the trinket box in the trash and
turns away quickly Paces Hands fidget eyes dart around the
room

Frustration builds and Elizabeth lets out a FERAL SCREAM -
KICKS the trash can over - papers scatter across the floor

Near breaking-point she gathers herself Calms her breathing

The trinket box sits on the floor glistening under tube
lights Taunting her She walks over and picks it up a
disappointment in her eyes for a battle lost

INT PETERSON WYATT - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT - PAST

Elizabeth walks toward her car finally finished for the
evening She sees Clara and Alex in conversation near her
black Mercedes S-Class and initially thinks nothing of it
removes the key fob from her pocket

A little closer in she stops Observes them from a distance
Theyre talking smiling as though both know they should go
their separate ways but neither wants to part Like awkward
college kids on a first date

Elizabeth smiles faintly a touch ruefully She hangs back
not wanting to interrupt

She looks elsewhere for a moment but can’t help but look back
to see Clara give Alex a quick kiss and smile before splitting
off to their cars

Elizabeth unlocks her car and gets in

Elizabeth closes the door and silence envelops the luxury
cabin She hits the start button and the engine PURRS The MP3
player resumes some vaguely upbeat classical music -

No more than two seconds pass before Elizabeth shoots an arm
out to shut it up She sits for a moment’s silence sealed off
in her little bubble Finally she belts up and pulls out

JANE
The public is overwhelmingly in favor
of gun control They’ve exploited
this and secured the finance
necessary to mount a serious
challenge

CONNORS
Is there not some saturation point
Where everyone who’s backed their
position will have coughed in

JANE
Yes but with 80 of the American
public on their side there’s still
some way to go With McGill in the
news this is as good as it gets for
us

GEORGE
What are your projections

JANE
If we take all the uncommitted
Congressmen and split them 50-50
they win 60-40 they still win Wed
need 64 to scrape it

(to George Dupont)
You said you would take care of this
The whole reason I came to this firm
was for the woman who’s putting you
all to shame-

GEORGE

BOB SANDFORD
How exactly do you plan to stop it

GEORGE

Clear the room please

Those who know to exit take their leave George Bob Sandford
Connors and RM Dutton remain

GEORGE (CONT’D)
The only reason we’re here is because
of one person Without her we walk
all over them

BOB SANDFORD
What are you suggesting

GEORGE
We need a way to remove her from the
Heaton-Harris campaign put her on
the defensive For example a
Congressional hearing into her
unorthodox lobbying practices

BOB SANDFORD
How would such a thing come about

GEORGE
I know of a Congressman who may be
open to the idea But it would take a
lot of persuasion

BOB SANDFORD
I‘1l put up whatever it takes to kill
that amendment

RM DUTTON
Hold on You’1l need a convincing
allegation of impropriety as the
basis for an investigation

CONNORS
Id give my left nut to drag her rep
through the dirt but you’re not
gonna get it She’s a CYA specialist
I never met anyone so pedantic in my

never dealt with those guys She kept

CUT TO

JANE
She’d ply Congressmen with benefits
Free meals tickets to events
golfing weekends All paid for by our
clients via the firm

GEORGE
Well that right there’s enough-

JANE
No it’s not She’d make a point of
invoicing them Every single benefit
from a flight ticket to a glass of
champagne she made me keep receipts
and invoice the Congressmen Sure
there was an understanding they’d
never pay but we’d always send an
invoice The debt shows as an asset
on our balance sheet we can
theoretically call it in any time we
want

GEORGE
And that’s legal

JANE
Apparently so You know now that you
ask there was a time
(hesitates)
Ah it’s nothing

GEORGE
Tell me about it

JANE
Just a silly technicality I didn’t
even notice it was Franklin-

GEORGE
Jane I know she mentored you and
you have a lot of respect for her
but you chose this firm If you have
any inkling of misconduct

JANE
What would happen To her

GEORGE
(lying)
Nothing We’re mining for leverage
get her to stay out of Nebraska

JANE

There may have been a financial
irregularity she glossed over With

tax I think she might have violated

can’t vote for it with one hand and
choke it with the other

leading an inquiry into Sloane’s
affairs in response to an article
exposing her litany of misdeeds

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
What article

GEORGE
We’re arranging it

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
The cost of hearings run into the
millions That’s public money-

GEORGE
Ron the Gun Lobby have identified
you as the man to pull this off If
you decline I can’t stop them
blitzing you with negative finance
which sure as your shit doesn’t
smell like root beer they will They
won’t stop until they annihilate you
D’you know the root meaning of the
word ‘annihilate’ It’s Latin It
means reduce to nothing That’s what
they’re going to do to you Ron

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
So what I’ll be taking a wedge from
the Lobby and leading the attack on
Heaton-Harris’ biggest proponent A
sixth-grader could connect the dots

GEORGE
We can create a structure to
obfuscate the source Your big wedge
will arrive courtesy of eight to
twelve smaller entities with no
affiliation to guns

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
How big a wedge are we talking

GEORGE
Big enough to be the difference
between the continuation of your
duties as a member of Congress and
the reduction of your career to
nothing The article’s coming

George exits the car leaving Sperling to consider his words
Suddenly agitated Sperling BRUSHES vigorously at his forearm
which rests on the center console as if swatting at some
persistent itch

sets a dictaphone down on the table Posner does likewise
There’s a very obvious hostility behind all the niceties

PRU WEST
Ms Sloane You’re at the forefront
of an industry with a very bad rep
D’you think it’s deserved

ELIZABETH
Yes When a company forks out
campaign contributions to a
Congressman who then supports
legislation favorable to that
company the public see bribery
Because that’s what it is

PRU WEST
Can the system change

ELIZABETH
Even if you take the money out of it
lobbying will never go away At its
core lobbying is about
relationships You can’t outlaw
relationships

PRU WEST
But the bribery you described
earlier that can change

ELIZABETH
Yes but it won’t The two parties
capable of effecting change have no
interest in doing so Why would
Congress change a system they profit
from

PRU WEST
Who’s the second party

ELIZABETH
You are The media It’s far easier
to generate hatred for individuals
than it is for abstract systems so
you don’t go for the system you go
for the personality You choose
scandal over insight and who can
blame you readers respond to it If
you don’t feed it to them your rival
will you’ll go bust and lose your
job Which brings me to my question
for you why are you wasting my time

PRU WEST
Excuse me

ELIZABETH
Youre asking me abstract questions
about the nature of lobbying which
sure as you were born crying will
not form the basis of your article
I’m going to go out on a limb and say
this meeting is nothing more than an
exercise in box-ticking and your
article’s already written

GORDON
(to Pru West)
Don’t respond to that
(to Elizabeth)
That’s purely speculative on your
part if you have any evidence of
this by all means produce it

ELIZABETH
Like I said I’m going out on a limb

Pru West smiles smugly knowing Elizabeth is right but
powerless to stop the process

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Who is controlling you

POSNER
Let’s not do this

ELIZABETH
Why now

GORDON

The fact is you have no way of
knowing what Ms West intends to do
with the information gleaned from-

ELIZABETH
It’s clear you have no interest in
what I have to say-

GORDON
And how would you know that

It’s a hit alright

ELIZABETH
I thought it could’ve been worse

ROSS
I got four factual errors so far

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
This isn’t good

ELIZABETH
Stop fussing Put The Star in the

files both bursting at the seams on Rodolfo’s desk

ROSS
Every attack since the Pru West hack-
job that kicked it all off Every
single one just the right side of
libelous

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
So much for it going away

ROSS
My personal favorite is the one about
how you toppled the High School Head
Prefect in a fabricated plagiarism
scandal I’m assuming that’s not
libelous ‘cause I can totally see it

ELIZABETH
God that witch was insufferable

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
This is serious That Sperling’s got
the hots for you do you two have a
past

ELIZABETH
I barely know him it’s a put-up

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
This could result in an indictment

ELIZABETH
I’ll have to resign anyway

ROSS
Are you kidding for what Why

ELIZABETH
(points to folders)
That Heaton-Harris gets colder with
every day I remain associated with
it

ROSS
Were 29 days ‘til the vote still
five votes down and losing ground If
they’re orchestrating this that’s
exactly what they want-
ELIZABETH
And our only play is to give it to
them

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
She’s right

ROSS
We can’t run the campaign without-

ELIZABETH

Nonsense of course you can I need
to lawyer up for an indictment

ROSS
You didn’t do anything

ELIZABETH
No but we did We got too close

I want you

Great My first action as your
attorney is to advise you to fire me
and hire one Dan Steinitz Len Watts
or Edmund Gross

ELIZABETH
We may have our differences-

POSNER
You didn’t just wander into the
offices of Hackney Carriage alright
If I wanted to work for people like
you I’d have taken the offer from
Cole Kravitz Waterman

ELIZABETH
So we can’t agree on the color of the
sky I can’t help thinking youve
misjudged me

POSNER
I can live with that

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY - PRESENT

Congressman Sperling questions Elizabeth

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Regarding your representation of the
Kenyan government Senator Len
Davies the sponsor of the bill you
dubbed the ‘Nutella Tax’ was flown
to Kenya first-class and put up ina
five-star hotel only a week before
the bill was dropped Our audit puts
the cost of this trip at over
20000 Did the Senator ever
reimburse these expenses

ELIZABETH
No

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Was he ever invoiced for them

ELIZABETH
No

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Was there any expectation that
Senator Davis would repay this

ELIZABETH
The trip was paid for by the Kenyan
Government If you’re implying I
violated the gift ban you’re barking
up the wrong tree Sovereign states
are exempt from the gift ban under
Chapter 2 of the House and Senate
Ethnics Manuals

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING

You sure the Kenyans paid for that
trip See I don’t think they did

(beat)
The trip was funded from a pooled
account Is it not true that one of
your staff raised a concern which
you hastily dismissed

ELIZABETH
I’1l tell you what I told Franklin
Walsh The Kenyan Government
contributed enough to that account to
cover the trip five times over

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
But it’s true that the account
contained funds from private
entities FandB conglomerates

ELIZABETH
Their contributions made up one
quarter of the total yes

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Is it not also true that because the
Kenyans instructed you late on this
funds from private entities were
already in the pooled account when
the Kenyans transferred their funds
in

ELIZABETH
Yes I believe so

Posner looks crestfallen He knows what this means MEDIA BUZZ
ratchets up They smell blood

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING

(beat nods)
Well We have ourselves a smoking
gun This is a violation of Chapter 2
of the Senate Ethics Manual which
prohibits the furnishing of money or
gifts from a private entity to a
member of Congress

ELIZABETH
I repeat the trip was furnished by
the Kenyan government-—

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
I’m afraid that’s not accurate In
accordance with Regulation 17
subsection (d) of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board
guidelines funds in a pooled account
are to be treated under a principle
known as FIFO First In First Out
It means that money paid into a joint
account first is the first money to
be paid out of it when the account is
drawn upon The effect of this is
that the Kenyan Government didn’t
contribute one dime towards the
20000 that was spent on Senator
Davis’ trip It was covered by the
sixteen private entities who first
contributed to that account Which
puts you as the one who authorized
the transfer in violation of the
Congressional gift ban

Elizabeth freezes for a moment blind-sided It doesn’t last

ELIZABETH
(incredulous)

FIFO That’s your trump card You
drag me in for a week of hearings
indelicately wedge an endoscope up my
posterior and all this time the
only incriminating item in your
possession is an accounting snafu
One wonders why this wasn’t over in
two hours flat It’s almost as though
youve held some kind of special
interest in dragging this process out
aslong as possible

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
I have a duty to be thorough in my
investigations After all I
represent the people of the United
States of America

(beat)

This concludes my questioning of the
witness Thank you Ms Sloane

Elizabeth gets out of the hot seat and takes up a position
next to Posner As she does Congressman Sperling announces

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING (CONT’D)
We have one further witness we’d like
to call

POSNER
(whispers to Elizabeth)
FIFO Seriously Maybe you’re not so
sleazy after all

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
The people call Mr Robert Forde

Elizabeth’s face drops upon hearing the name

ELIZABETH
I wouldn’t bet on it

Seeing her reaction Posner knows this is bad and pipes up

POSNER
Mr Chairman I don’t recall being
given notice of your intention to-

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
We have only recently been able to
locate the witness Mr Posner

ELIZABETH
(to Posner)
Let it play

POSNER
Mr Chairman a moment with my client
please

They confer For the first time Elizabeth seems broken

POSNER
What is this Who’s Robert Forde

ELIZABETH
I don’t know why I’m even surprised
How stupid I’ve been

POSNER
I can raise an objection we can-

ELIZABETH
Let it play damn it they’ll get it
out there one way or another

A beat Posner relents

LATER Forde is escorted to the stand by a Capitol Police
officer He looks at Elizabeth but she won’t meet his gaze

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Mr Forde please raise your right
hand Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth under pains
and penalties of perjury

Forde hesitates for a moment A quiet anger on his face

FORDE
Yeah I swear

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Mr Forde could you please describe
the nature of your work

FORDE

I got many jobs PT fitness modelin’
on the side

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
What would you say earns you the bulk
of your income at present

Forde clenches his jaw He leans forward

FORDE
I work as an escort in DC

The media BUZZ heightens

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
You sleep with women for money

FORDE
I meet the client’s needs Sometimes
that’s bein’ on their arm Sometimes
more Youd be surprised how many
women just wanna sit ‘n talk to
someone from a different neck’a the
woods who ain’t gonna judge ‘em

Forde glances to Elizabeth remembering their earlier
conversation She can’t even look at him

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
But part of your job entails
having intercourse for payment

FORDE
oe Yes

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Have you ever met Elizabeth Sloane

FORDE
Yep

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Could you please identify her

Forde nods to Elizabeth Her head remains bowed and she
continues to avert her gaze

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
What was the nature of your
relationship

Forde hesitates The media salivate

FORDE
I was attendin’ a function with a
client Ms Sloane was there I tried
to introduce myself but she bucked
me off

Congressman Sperling’s face hardens In the gallery George
Dupont shoots RM Dutton a piercing glare who looks just as
shocked Elizabeth now looks at Forde Not the answer any of
them was expecting

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Mr Forde have you ever entertained
Ms Sloane as a client

FORDE
«e- No

Elizabeth tries her best to hide her surprise but there’s a
touch of confusion on her face Forde’s behavior is not
conforming to her expectation nor world view

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Mr Forde may I remind you that you
are speaking under oath and any
statement which is later proved to be
materially inaccurate may expose you
to liability for perjury before
Congress This is a serious offense
and carries the suitably serious
sanction of incarceration I ask
again did you entertain Ms Sloane
in any capacity as a client

FORDE
No I didn’t

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
(hardened)
Thank you Mr Forde You’re
dismissed
Forde exits the stand and is walked out by Capitol Police

Elizabeth watches him go confused and genuinely touched that
he put his head on the block to protect her

INT PETERSON WYATT - POSNER’S OFFICE - NIGHT - PRESENT

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
FIFO You’re supposed to be the most
debased corrupt operative on the
hill and the only thing they can
nail you with is FIFO

POSNER
It’s enough to put you behind bars

ELIZABETH
I doubt they’1ll bother They got what
they wanted

POSNER
They wanted you behind bars

ELIZABETH

Ross appears in the doorway

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
How’s our old friend Heaton-Harris

ROSS
Comatose on its death bed The whole
issue’s gone cold

ELIZABETH
(to Posner)
That’s what they wanted

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
Shameless bastards That stunt with
the prostitute - anyone who knows
anything about you will know how
utterly preposterous that is

Elizabeth and Posner exchange a quick glance
RODOLFO SCHMIDT (CONT’D)

We fought the good fight Got closer
than we had any right to

ELIZABETH
You didn’t hire me to get close
(To Ross)

What would it take to revive it

ROSS
Right now it’s not even making it to
the floor

ELIZABETH
What would it take to revive it

Elizabeth nods as if finally conceding defeat

ELIZABETH
Well I should get going

RODOLFO SCHMIDT
We’ll all be there tomorrow

Hope for an earthquake

INT ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT

Dim lighting in Elizabeth’s living room Something about it
has changed since we were last here a sparse arrangement of
high-end furniture coffee tables and tasteful lamps

Most notable is the absence of work-related clutter No
papers folders or file boxes A vibrant potted plant where
there was nothing before Dare we say like a home

The Litigators lies face-down on a side table Next to it in
the comfortable armchair used for reading Elizabeth reclines
in deep peaceful sleep

It’s packed to the rafters and BUZZING Public gallery full of
familiar faces Connors George Dupont RM Dutton Jane
Rodolfo Schmidt and the whole of the Peterson Wyatt team

INT US CONGRESS - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT

The same room where we first met Elizabeth and Posner
Professional to the last Posner coaches her on proceedings
POSNER

They’re going to ask you if you want
to make a statement before they read

your sentence Don’t make a
statement Got it No good can come
of you making a statement You’1ll
expose yourself to contempt of
Congress defamation-

ELIZABETH
I understand

POSNER

Don’t make a statement Just decline

and move on

ELIZABETH
Anything else Or can we just go in
there and get this over with

Posner nods Elizabeth stands straightens her jacket she
too professional to the last She turns to leave when --

POSNER

Posner hesitates Extends his hand to Elizabeth He wouldn’t
dare admit he was wrong about her but they both know that’s

what it means This time she shakes Proudly

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY - PRESENT

Elizabeth is marched to the dock by CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS

The ever-sanctimonious Ron M Sperling presides

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING

Ms Sloane Before we proceed to the

business of sentencing you are
entitled to make a statement
reflecting on your crime Is there
something you’d like to say

ELIZABETH
Yes Congressman there is

Posner closes his eyes Why does he even bother

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Take all the time you need

ELIZABETH

When I received an offer to take up a

position advocating for gun control
I was under no illusions of how
difficult it would be

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Ms Sloane is this a reflection on

your crime or your recent efforts to-

ELIZABETH
Mr Sperling you’ve effectively
spent the last seven days prying into
every detail of my personal and
professional existence not to
mention the fact you just permitted
me to take ‘all the time I need’ So
with all due respect shut up

A pregnant collective pause permeates the entire room
Sperling studies her a suppressed smirk beneath his pervasive
professional decorum

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Proceed

Elizabeth hesitates to compose herself gather her thoughts

ELIZABETH
My work as a lobbyist has been
defined by a peculiar kind of
conflict I’ve made a career from
defending my clients’ attempts to
maximize their profit I loathe to
use words such as ‘duty’ and
‘responsibility’ because I don’t
believe such concepts to be bases for
human behavior I’ve advocated
strongly for self-interest as the
only rational basis

She looks at Posner

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

I recently told my attorney that
ideology is dead that people merely
co-opt whichever political school of
thought best serves their desire to
profit personally Looking back on my
history of representations I can
only marvel at how wrong I was

Backs straighten in the public gallery surprised at the hint
of contrition

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
My decision to refuse the Gun Lobby
and to work for the Heaton-Harris
campaign was decidedly contrary to
the interests of my career
reputation my bank balance and
sanity I’ve been branded a master
manipulator and a parasite on
American democracy I must say I
took the job at Peterson Wyatt for
reasons which weren’t entirely
consistent with my world view

Forde stands at the back of the gallery listening intently to
her every word Elizabeth’s eyes flash to him

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I guess sometimes people challenge
themselves - do things they don’t
fully understand that don’t make
sense to them or even things they’re
not comfortable with Not from an
self-serving impulse to protect their
lot but as a matter of principle
Because they happen to believe in
the circumstances it’s plainly and
simply the right thing to do

Forde straightens raises his head as if he knows she’s
talking to him

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Next Sunday it will have been eight
months since Claudia Lisa and
Hannah Patterson were shot dead
without rhyme or reason in the
Southridge Mall Greendale
Wisconsin

INT PATTERSON RESIDENCE (WISCONSIN) - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT

Joel Patterson (from page 41) who lost his wife and children
in the shooting is glued to Elizabeth’s speech on TV taking
it all in resolute in his efforts to hold back tears

ELIZABETH (ON TV FILTERED) (CONTD)

(beat)
I wasn’t personally acquainted with
these people nor have I ever known a
gun victim But there are many out
there who aren’t so lucky Joel
Patterson a loving husband and
father Their friends and teachers
past and present Anyone whose lives
those three innocent people would
have touched They need a voice

INT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
The truth is I took on each and
every one of my representations
because I believed as a matter of
ideology in the causes I for which
advocated

(echoing George Dupont)

Some may regard this as ‘infantile
save-the-world idealism’ but I’ve
come to realize that conviction-
lobbying served my interests very
well it catapulted me over the
legions of mercenaries to the very
top of my industry all without
playing golf or being a man

CHUCKLES from the crowd Rodolfo Schmidt smiles widely eyes
glazed remembering their very first conversation

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

My point is this and there’s no
better place to make it than on
national TV before America’s
assembled press

Brian and Ross share a look remembering when they bemoaned
the absence of a platform for their under-publicized cause
Their wheels turning Did Elizabeth orchestrate all of this

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

What sets humans apart is our
capacity for reason The foresight to
realize that our interests are best
served not by short-term grabs for
personal gain but by holding a real
ideology Cherishing it using it
as a guide for all our decisions and
our actions We can maximize our gain
not by engaging in zero-sum games of
I-win-you-lose but by cooperating -
doing what we believe is right not
just for ourselves but for everyone
Wed all be better off this way
individually and collectively we
could all have it so much better -
with so little effort if only we
could just see--

Elizabeth usually so controlled and eloquent stumbles over
her words The wall of granite has crumbled She looks to her
colleagues in the gallery each full of pride and admiration

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Now I know I’m not the easiest
person in the world to work with but
in this room sit two sets of people
with very different ideologies They
found common ground and made huge
sacrifices in their careers and
personal lives all in the name of
doing what they believe is right One
almost lost her life in the process

Esme holds her gaze her own walls finally coming down

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Some put their identity on the line
to serve a cause which ultimately
protects the essence of what that
very identity means to them

Clara clenches Alexs hand a lump in her throat knowing that
Elizabeth has finally given her the acknowledgement she’s
longed for

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

These people are not disinterested
altruists They’re just smart enough
to realize that their own interests
are best served by doing the right
thing for society as a whole

The team sit wide-eyed surprised and moved by her tribute
In another section of the public gallery Jane sits next to
George Dupont She shares their expression

Elizabeth casts her gaze toward the six present Congressmen
who sit on the panel They contemplate her words

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I urge members of Congress to do
likewise and exercise their power
and influence in a manner that
benefits everyone not just
themselves Many an honest politician
has tried only to be promptly voted
out because there’s always someone -
some rat - who’s prepared to stoop
lower than the rest to get his nose
in the trough and by so doing turn
the entire electoral process into a
race to the bottom

Now she aims a pointed stare at Congressman Sperling himself
who sits in stone-faced silence

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Make no mistake These are the real
parasites on American democracy

Elizabeth tightens up her softening emotions and levels her
chin takes in the room

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
This game is one of trust it only
works when everyone is playing
People say ad nauseam that they
want change I appeal to our finest
nature - for want of a better
expression - to be that change

The packed room is stunned quiet Journalists regard her
earnestly Photographers have stopped snapping put their
equipment down Nobody expected this not even Elizabeth

BRIAN
(whispers )
That’s not exactly the meme

LAUREN
(emotional under breath)
Shut up Brian

BRIAN
Right It’s not important

In the public gallery Jane turns to George Dupont

JANE
Mr Dupont I’d like to discuss my
future

GEORGE

This is hardly the time

Back on the stand Elizabeth sips from a glass of water and
composes herself Partially restores the granite wall

ELIZABETH
Lobbying is about foresight About
anticipating your opponent’s moves
and devising countermeasures The
winner plots one step ahead of the
opposition and plays her trump card
just after they play theirs It’s
about making sure you surprise them
and they don’t surprise you

Posner’s eyes narrow He’s heard this spiel before right at
the start of the hearings

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I anticipated that if I got
sufficiently close with Heaton-
Harris there may be an assault
against me personally to stall our
momentum and tarnish our credibility

Jane turns to Dupont again

JANE
Actually it is

She hands him an envelope

JANE (CONTD)

My resignation
(she stands)
Academia’s more my scene

Jane pivots and exits Dupont regards the envelope like it
contains test results for Anthrax poisoning

CONGRESSMAN SPERLING
Ms Sloane I think it’s about time-

ELIZABETH
Before I left Cole Kravitz and
Waterman I retained an operative of
mine in their ranks

This sends the media into a FRENZY Dupont’s eyes WIDEN He
looks back after Jane His ass is on fire

I’m curious FIFO That was you
throwing them a bone Without it
they really would’ve had nothing to
incite the hearing

hoping nobody would notice the breach
was committed on the day I departed

And you withheld this part of your
strategy from your deposable team
members because

misjudged this woman

You instigated the whole thing
Brought the roof of the US Capitol
crashing down on your head put
yourself - among others - through all
of this For what a gun bill

How’s that doing by the way

The Gun Lobby has supplanted Wall
Street as America’s most hated You’d
have to talk to Ross for the numbers
but it’s moving again

suicide No firm’s going near you
not now You’re too high-profile

ELIZABETH
I knew this would be my last hurrah
the moment I conceived it

Youre the champion of self-interest
right I fail to see how self-
immolation in furtherance of a gun
bill is in your interests This was
disinterested altruism

alternative is suicide by career Any

Ross applauds from afar his mind still blown by her ruse
Esme dressed casually and looking more relaxed than ever

Brian Lauren and Franklin complete the equation They make
their way past security

Elizabeth doesn’t know how to react the idea that they’ve all
taken time out of their busy lives traveled all this way -
just to see her to be there for her - it’s too much

She starts to tear up and turns away instinctively loathes
to show any weakness in public But this is the one battle she
knows she can’t win She turns back and moves toward her
colleagues - now unequivocally her friends too

Jane is first to greet her and they enter into a long

embrace Emotions bubble over The rest of her team gather

round All look very much at ease Dare we say like a family
FADE TO BLACK
