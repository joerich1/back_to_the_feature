to a nearby table

DAISY Shes enjoying the show Hes polishing the

(displeased)

As the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the
good
stuff Ray palms a coin from the tip basket
ATTENDENT

Ray offers the quarter a gesture of uncommon
generosity
RAY

in mind
Claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door

stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket

RAY
Sorry man My mistake

INT SPANKYS -- NIGHT

On the stage the chanteuse has downshifted into a
number about back-door lovers and broken dreams
Ray steps out of the mens room and is instantly

BULLETHEAD a man who makes his living being large and
threatening

RAY
Watch the threads Bullethead If
this is about my tab Ive got it
covered
Pressed up against the wall Ray reaches into his

produces Claudes wallet Bullethead snatches it

it and is not impressed
BULLETHEAD
This aint about your tab Ray Youve

He stuffs the wallet back into Rays jacket and hustles

out the back door past the bouncer who let him in

BOUNCER

bill Especially such an incredibly
large bill

INT VAN -- NIGHT

Claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors
are

slammed behind him He bangs and shouts but its no
use

RAY
Save your energy Claude Youre
gonna need it

Ray is stretched out against the back wall Claude is
knocked
to the floor as the van lurches into motion
RAY
Here this belongs to you
(tossing Claude his
wallet)
It was empty when I found it

CLAUDE
Good old Monroe

Ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to Claude who
isnt
interested

RAY
What I want to know is what happened
to your cush between the time that
you got up from the table and when I
caught up with you in the Johnny

CLAUDE
I dont see where thats any of your
business

RAY
Did those two muscle heads shake you
down Swear Ive seen them down at
the track with Sure-shot Riley Thats

Busted Claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes
off

the neck before tilting it high Ray gets a good
chuckle out
of this straight cat in the bow tie

CLAUDE
Where they taking us anyway

RAY
Probably to Spankys headquarters
down at the pier

CLAUDE
Good Im looking forward to meeting
this Spanky Give me a chance to

EXT PIER -- NIGHT
The van pulls into a the loading bay of a warehouse at

the
end of a short pier on the Harlem River
INT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Bullethead and a HENCHMAN pull Ray and Claude from the
back
of the van They find themselves in a dark warehouse
filled
with crates of contraband
CLAUDE
(sotto)
What are they gonna do to us
RAY
You Dine and ditch right
(Claude nods)
Over ten bucks
(he nods again)
Youre probably looking at a thumb
CLAUDE
A thumb What do you mean like cut
it off For ten bucks
(Ray nods)
That include the tip
Claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound
of
approaching FOOTSTEPS echoing across the vast space
Claude
and Ray peer into the darkness
SPANKY
(from the darkness)
You picked the wrong night to fuck
with me Ray I just lost three men
and a truck full of Canadian whiskey
You know what that kind of thing
does to my business It makes me
want to lash out and hurt somebody
SPANKY JOHNSON emerges into the light He uses a small
silver
spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each
nostril

He glances at Claude

SPANKY
Whos he Friend of yours Ray

CLAUDE
I never saw this man before tonight
Hes a lowlife degenerate who lurks
in bathrooms Im a professional
man an upstanding citizen I go to
church on Sunday

SPANKY
Then what are you doing here

BULLETHEAD
Failure to pay

CLAUDE

(rattled)
Look Mr Johnson you seem like a
reasonable man I got a good job

with my first pay check With
interest I dont want to tell you
how to conduct your business but if
you cut off my finger you wont get
jack Working an adding machine I
gotta be whole

(his fingers dancing

over imaginary keys)
I need my thumbs and all my fingers
for praying and doing good

Spanky holds up a hand silencing Claude

SPANKY
The choirboy wants to keep his
fingers Who am I to argue Drop
him

CLAUDE
Drop him What does drop him mean

Claude protests loudly as Bullethead and the henchman
bind
his hands and feet Spanky turns to Ray

SPANKY
You gotta lotta balls showing your
face around my club If a mans gonna
run numbers on my side of Broadway
you think hed have the common sense
to keep a low profile But not Ray
Gibson
The goons hoist Claude up on another pulley and dangle
him

head first over a hole in the floor Several feet down
the

Harlem River laps against the wooden pylons

CLAUDE
No not down there That waters
filthy Help me out here man

Shrugging Ray pinches his nose and puffs out his
cheeks

The goons release the rope and Claude plunges into the
water

Spanky turns back to Ray

RAY
You dont have to drown that fella
Spanky You already scared him half
to death He didnt know who he was
fucking with

SPANKY
But you do What does that say about
you Ray What does that say about
me Ive given you a lot of leeway
over the years on account of your
father But he didnt last long enough
to teach you the meaning of the word
respect so I guess Im gonna have to
school you myself

RAY
Come on Spank Im just trying to
get by here You remember how it was
when you were starting out

The henchman yanks on the rope Claude emerges from the
hole
gasping for breath

CLAUDE
I was supposed to wear this suit on
Monday

The henchman releases the rope sending Claude back
into the

water Ray reaches into his jacket Bullethead pulls a
gun

and presses it into Rays temple Ray gives him a look
and
cautiously pulls out his bottle

SPANKY
Whats that some of your bathtub
brew

RAY

Puerto Rican rum See for yourself

Ray tosses him the bottle Spanky uncorks sniffs

samples
the goods Hes impressed
SPANKY
Whered you get this
RAY
Comes up the Mississippi I can get
more A lot more I was thinking
about going into business for myself
but under the circumstances Id be
willing to take on a partner
Once again the henchman yanks on the rope and Claude
comes
up sucking air desperately He releases the rope
submerging
Claude for a third time
SPANKY
Im interested Keep talking
RAY
All I need is the front money and a
truck I could be back in two three
days tops if I had somebody to share
the driving
Spanky considers the terms Can he afford to trust Ray
Can

he afford not to

SPANKY
If you fuck me on this one Ill
spare no expense

RAY
Understood

SPANKY
Alright Ray youve got a deal
Pick your man and get going
Ray glances around The pulley rope is still twitching

in
the water
RAY
Ill take the little choirboy if
you dont mind
SPANKY
If I was you Id want somebody who
can handle himself in a tight spot
RAY
I just want somebody who wont put a
bullet in my back once the truck is
full
Spanky sees Rays point He nods to the henchman who
hoists
Claudes limp body out of the water and onto the
cement
Spanky plants a foot on Claudes chest and applies
pressure
A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claudes
mouth as
he sputters back to life
SPANKY
For your sake I hope you can drive
Somebody give him some dry clothes
CUT TO
THE SPINNING WHEEL OF A TRUCK
The CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the old Ford truck to
find

Claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat

Tight-lipped Claude shifts in his seat

If Claude

RAY

silence)

EXT ROADSIDE DINER -- DAY

The truck veers off the highway and jerks to a halt in

front

of the rundown establishment

INT ROADSIDE DINER -- DAY

A dozen WHITE FOLKS look up as Ray and Claude push
through

the door
RAY
Man something smells good in here

Hows everybody doing

Nothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room
CLAUDE
(sotto)
Maybe we oughta find another place

RAY
Are you kidding Tell me you dont
want a slice of that pie right over
there

CLAUDE
I must have left my appetite outside
which is where I think we ought to
be right now

Claude tugs Ray towards the door but Ray wont be
dissuaded

He boldly addresses a YOUNG MAN in an apron behind the

counter

RAY
Good evening Billy Wed like some
coffee and a couple of slices of
that homemade pie youve got
advertised

BILLY
How you know my names Billy

RAY
It says so right there on your shirt

BILLY
(glancing down)
That what that says

Billys MAMA sets a piping hot pie on the back counter
and

steps up next to her son She casts a disparaging
glance at

Claudes suit

MAMA
If you boys can read so good how
come you missed that sign in the
window

Claude considers the sign shes pointing to
CLAUDE

You mean this sign The one that
says No Coloreds Allowed Thats a
good question Ray how come we missed
the sign

RAY
Look maam weve been driving all

Claude narrows his eyes

CLAUDE

CLAUDE
Excuse me maam I bet a brick will

Claude lays down a dollar bill Mama casually pulls a

shotgun
from under the counter
MAMA
And I bet this right here will turn
you into a colored pie
CLAUDE
Okay Ray I think we can go now
Much obliged
Ray gives the whole place a cool once-over as Claude
pulls
him out the door Mama turns to Billy still studying
the
stitching on his shirt
MAMA
Dont be concentrating so hard baby
Youre liable to seize yourself again
EXT DOCKS -- NIGHT
The truck rolls up to the waters edge Ray kills the
engine

and flashes the lights twice In the passenger seat
Claude
is fast asleep After a few moments a FAT MAN appears
shining a flashlight into the cab

RAY
How you doing Were looking for
Slim

SLIM

You found him
Ray cocks an eyebrow
EXT DOCKS -- NIGHT

Under cover of darkness a couple of MEN finish loading

crates
into the bed of the truck Ray and Claude keep their
eyes
peeled for the law Down by the river they can see
lights
and hear music from a district of rowdy juke joints
SLIM
steps up wiping his hands
SLIM
Thats it fellas Thirty six cases
of Puerto Ricos finest At five
bucks a case thats 180
Ray pulls out a wad and slaps it in Slims sweaty palm
The

fat man starts counting it out

RAY

CLAUDE

RAY

a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and

A look of excitement crosses Claudes face but he
quickly
shakes it off

CLAUDE
Thats gas money
Exasperated Ray stuffs a few bills into Claudes

pocket
RAY
Theres your gas money You stay
here and watch the truck And dont
worry Ive got the keys
Left alone Claude mutters and kicks at the dirt He
leans
against the truck
UP AHEADEXT JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT
Ray emerges from the woods and heads down the hill
toward
the juke joint Claude hustles up next to him
CLAUDE
Im just gonna keep an eye on you

INT JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT
A ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the
Mississippi
The band is laying down some serious Delta blues
creating
an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption
On a far side of the room Ray is playing poker with
some
LOCALS He seems to be having a bad night WINSTON
HANCOCK
a formidable black man sweeps in another big pot and
puffs
happily on his cigar
OVER AT THE BAR
Perched on a stool Claude shoots a dark look at Ray
and
motions for the door Ray waves him off and returns to
his
game Claude becomes aware of a soft young female hand
on

his shoulder

SYLVIA
Ive never seen you in here before

CLAUDE
(staring at the hand)
Thats because Ive never been here
before

SYLVIA
Im Sylvia Whats your name

Against his better judgement Claudes gaze follows the
long

slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on
SYLVIAS

angelic face He is struck dumb

SYLVIA
Cant you remember your own name

CLAUDE
I know it begins with a C

SYLVIA
Well Mr C how about buying a
girl a drink
(to the bartender)
Two bourbons

CLAUDE
I really shouldnt I gotta keep an
eye on my friend

SYLVIA
He looks like he can take care of
himself

The drinks arrive She places a shot glass in Claudes

reluctant hand She winks provocatively and slowly
pours the

whiskey down her throat Instinctively Claude tosses
back

his shot

CLAUDE
Claude Thats my name Claude Thats

it He glances at Ray who casually considers his
RAY
Ill take two
The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards
INSERT -- Ray fans his cards to reveal a full house
After considering the other players at the table Ray
whats left of his money into the center of the table
three other PLAYERS fold with disgust Winston squints
and hard at Ray then pushes everything he has into the
of the table

WINSTON
Ill see that

Winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some

money on the pile

WINSTON
And while were at it lets sweeten
the pot

RAY

Looks like my sugar bowls empty
Mr Hancock

WINSTON
(reaching for the pot)

Thats just too damn bad aint it

RAY

Ray checks his cards again He looks at the pot its a

lot
of money With this hand theres no way he can lose
He
places his daddys pocket watch on top of the pile
Winston
checks the time piece
WINSTON
Thatll cover it
Ray lays down his hand
RAY
Full boat ladies doing the paddling
WINSTON
Four threes
Ray sits back stunned Winston rakes in his winnings
The
game is over for the night The three other players
head to
the bar
WINSTON
Dont take it too hard New York

Winston tosses a silver dollar to Ray who snatches it
out
of the air Winston drops his hat on his head and moves
through the crowd and out the door
WAITRESS
Can I get you something
Ray shakes his head Carefully she begins to clear the
table

Suddenly he grabs her wrist Winstons glass tips
over Ray

flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile
of

cards

nothing in his hand until you came

Hancock He was dead Looks like

DEPUTY

federal prosecutor
PIKE
Lets not drag the feds into this I
can think of better uses for that
rum than letting it collect dust in
some government warehouse up in
Nashville

Pike winks at his deputy then turns to regard the
prisoners

PIKE
Besides why bother with bootlegging
when we got us a clear cut case of
murder

RAY
Excuse me sheriff As we explained

If you were to let us go I guarantee
he would show you his appreciation
if you know what I mean

PIKE
Are you offering me a bribe

RAY

CLAUDE
Look man how many times we gotta
tell you people we didnt kill that
guy

Claude blinks and looks again Pike has returned to his

Pike nods coldly Claude steps back into the kitchen

PIKE
If you dont mind my saying you

WILKINS
I believe in treating the convicts
with respect if thats what you

PIKE
(sarcastic)
Respect Well isnt that progressive

WILKINS
If somebody deserves respect Mr
Pike they receive it from me convict

Pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy
spoonful of gumbo

Pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot But as
raises it -- BLAM Pike is hurled backward by a shotgun

in his hands

After a significant beat Ray reaches down and gingerly
retrieves his daddys gold pocket watch

house

WILKINS
Well I think they bought it One of
