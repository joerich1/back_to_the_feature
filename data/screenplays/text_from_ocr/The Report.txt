INT CLIFFORDS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - INTERCUT

CLIFFORD
Just vanish in the face of these
allegations I could certainly
imagine an ambitious young man like
yourself spends years with his head
buried in some terrible spectacle
gets frustrated with the process
sees an opportunity to get the
truth out faster -- maybe crosses a
line I’m assuming this is the most
important thing you’ve ever been a
part of--

DANIEL JONES
I didn’t do it

CLIFFORD
Or I could see an equally
ambitious senator encouraging you
to do something Now would be a
good time to tell me

DANIEL JONES
That did not happen What I did I
did on my own

DANIEL JONES
My second day of grad school was
September 11th I was headed to a
lecture and everything
juststopped The next day I
changed all my classes to National
Security

DENIS
Good man So what’s the long-term
plan Where do you see yourself in
10 years You run for office

DANIEL JONES
Oh no no politics for me I think
Id be more effective behind the
scenes Somewhere I can really make
a difference

DENIS
So what about before Harvard
What’d you fill up your days with
then

DANIEL JONES
Teach for America for three years
in Baltimore Seventh graders I
read that you taught high school
Spanish in St Paul Minnesota
after college

DENIS
And LBJs first job was teaching at
the Mexican school in south Texas
Knowing how to deal with children
is a highly useful skill when
working on the hill

Dan laughs

DENIS (CONTD)
But from my perspective as Senate
staff I would wait until things
turn around up here I think
Senator Daschle would say the same
thing Go get some real world
experience in counterterrorism in
foreign policy -- try the CIA try
FBI

(MORE )

DENIS (CONTD)
Have them teach you what they don’t
teach in a classroom Then you can
come back here and help us fix all
the things that Bush and Cheney are
breaking--—

The phone rings and Denis answers

Saxby--

SENATOR CHAMBLISS

further 14-1 It is our job to
provide oversight

SENATOR CHAMBLISS
All during the campaign you got
candidate Obama saying how he
wanted to be the first post-
partisan President

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Saxby you know me It’s my
intention that this report be seen
as coming from the entire
Intelligence Committee Not just
from the Democrats

SENATOR CHAMBLISS
So who takes the lead

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Well I was thinking Dan Jones--

INT DC ST REGIS - RESTAURANT - MORNING

to Dan

SENATOR FEINSTEIN (VO)
He spent four years doing
counterterrorism at the FBI He’s
already got the security
clearances

Marcy gives Dan instructions on his new assignment

MARCY
The rules are the same as the tapes
investigation No politics No
bias And the Senator isn’t
interested in opinions or theories -
-just facts Based on what you
found out already this could go to
a pretty dark place You need to
keep your personal feelings out of
it -- that’s the first thing
Republicans are gonna look for No
talking to the press or your
girlfriend or any family members
Nobody outside of the Committee

Dan nods

MARCY (CONTD)
You’re going to get a team of six --
three Republicans three
Democrats

Republican sentences or Democratic
paragraphs

GEORGE TENET COFER BLACK Counterterrorism Director wanders
in Inside Tenet watches Meet the Press

CHENEY (TV)
We also have to work sort of the
dark side if you will Were going
to spend time in the shadows in the
intelligence world A lot of what
needs to be done here will have to
be done quietly without any

discussions
CHENEY (TV) (CONTD) TENET
Using sources and methods Fucking warned them -- August
that are available to our 6th Presidential briefing
intelligence agencies if “bin Laden Determined to
were going to be Strike in US” Flashing red
successful lights
COFER

And before that in July what did
we say “There will be significant
terrorist attacks against the
United States in the weeks and
months to come” It’s not your
fault

CHENEY (TV)
It is a mean nasty dangerous
dirty business out there and we
have to operate in that arena Im
convinced we can do it We can do
it successfully But we need to
make certain that we have not tied
the hands if you will of our
intelligence communities

28 INT CIA CONFERENCE ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER - FLASHBACK 28

Tenet Cofer CIA CHIEF COUNSEL JOHN RIZZO Thomas Eastman
and others gather
TENET
Counterterrorism Director Black and
I saw President Bush at Camp David
this weekend -- and the President
gave me his word that there will be
no changes in CIA leadership as a
result of Tuesday’s attacks We
will look forward now -- and not
waste time second guessing or
looking for blame Going forward
we will be the tip of the spear in
the battle against al-Qaeda

COFER
As I said to the President -- two
weeks we’ll have flies walking
across al-Qaeda eyeballs

TENET
I’ve asked Chief Counsel Rizzo here
to walk us through where we are
from a legal standpoint

RIZZO
The President has issued a
Memorandum of Notification giving
CIA the power to capture and detain
suspected terrorists on the
battlefield

EASTMAN
Detain them where Are we bringing
them to the US

COFER
We’re really not in the prison
business over in Counterterrorism

TENET
Look the budget for
Counterterrorism last week was
what 600 million dollars The
budget this week is whatever you
need it to be and we are in
whatever business it takes to get
the job done

DANIEL JONES (PRE-LAP)
Initially CIA legal stated

29 INT SENATOR FEINSTEIN’S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - PRESENT 29

Dan briefs Senator Feinstein and Marcy the first of many
such meetings

DANIEL JONES
that any facility used to hold
detainees had to meet the
requirements of the US Bureau of
Prisons But then Deputy Director
Pavitt thought that was going to be
too limiting

MARCY
So who came up with black sites

DANIEL JONES
Not totally clear My guess is
either a senior officer at
Counterterrorism -- CTC -- or ALEC
station bin Laden unit decided
black sites were the best option

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Well did the CIA tell the State
Department they were making deals
to hold people on foreign soil
Where was Secretary of State Powell
in all this

DANIEL JONES
Well I found a memo -- the CIA’s
General Counsel said the decision
was made not to tell Powell about
the program because

Dan leafs through some documents Finds a quote

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
He would “blow his stack if he were
to be briefed on what was going
on”

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Well who decided that

DANIEL JONES
Someone inside the White House

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Mhm What about interrogations
Beat

DANIEL JONES
President Bush’s memoranda just
authorized capturing and detaining -
- it didn’t say anything about
interrogations

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
And who gave them permission to
play that role

DANIEL JONES
Nobody Looks like it started with
legal at CTC

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
Do you want me to brief Senator
McCain on this I know he’s
interested--

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
The Republicans just pulled out of
the study Dan

INT OFF-SITE BASEMENT - WINDOWLESS ROOM - NEXT DAY

April walks in Notices only half the staff are

DANIEL JONES
Good morning

APRIL
Where is everybody

DANIEL JONES
Attorney General Holder opened a
criminal investigation into the
CIA As a result the Agency won’t
allow any of their people to be
interviewed for our report The
Republicans don’t see how we can
move forward so they’re out

APRIL
So does this mean we stop I mean
the Committee voted to investigate--

DANIEL JONES
The Senator says we keep going

now here

JULIAN
But we can’t actually speak to
anyone who was involved in the
program

DANIEL JONES
Right According to CIA legal CIA
personnel is only speaking to DOJ

APRIL
And is DOJ going to share their
findings I mean can we work with
them

DANIEL JONES
I’ve reached out to the special
prosecutor -- I’m waiting to hear
back

APRIL
Okay But if nobody who actually
worked on the program is going to
talk to us how do we investigate

DANIEL JONES
So we have their files their
emails and cables their memos We
have to use their own
communications to tell the story

APRIL
Do you have any idea how hard
that’s gonna be The tapes
investigation took two years Dan
and this is about a lot more than
what was on the tape

JULIAN
Yeah we don’t even know what
‘this’ is

DANIEL JONES
Right but we do know who it starts
with We go one detainee at a time

Dan returns to his computer April and Julian follow suit

investigation We are gathering

Eastman Bernadette Gretchen and Cofer

GRETCHEN

him CIA runs sources -- people who
cooperate That’s not these guys

COFER
Every second we are not draining
the detainee’s brain we are
rolling the dice

BERNADETTE
We need our people in the room We
need to be the ones asking the
questions now

EASTMAN
I heard from someone over in
Technical Services a woman named
Miriam about a couple of Air
Force psychologists who came in and
pitched a whole new approach to
interrogations Jim Mitchell and
Bruce Jessen Miriam says Mitchell
has the special sauce

INT CTC - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

JAMES MITCHELL (40s) and BRUCE JESSEN (50s) present their
interrogations plan to Eastman Bernadette and NEW CTC
DIRECTOR JOSE RODRIGUEZ

MITCHELL
Zubaydah didn’t tell us everything
because we stopped short of where
we needed to go

Mitchell clicks through a powerpoint presentation

MITCHELL (CONT’D)
SERE stands for survival evasion
resistance and escape It’s a
program to help prepare US
Special Forces for whatever they
might encounter if captured Now I
have over fourteen thousand hours
observing SERE interrogation
techniques Bruce here has more
than that

BERNADETTE
Observing As opposed to--

JESSEN
I took a course in conducting
interrogations as well I’ve worked
with volunteers in actual
simulations

MITCHELL
We feel we can reverse-engineer
these SERE techniques to induce
learned helplessness

EASTMAN
Can you explain what that means
“reverse-engineer”

JESSEN
Instead of using these techniques
to protect our people we use them
to achieve compliance in the
detainees

MITCHELL
Our plan involves using individual
assessments of detainees to create
a program designed to induce
debility dependency and dread

JESSEN
We call these the three D’s

Mitchell nods

MITCHELL
Three

EASTMAN
And there’s science to back this
up

MITCHELL

Oh yes yes sir

BERNADETTE
Excuse me Dr Mitchell Can you
elaborate on the techniques you’1l
be employing

MITHCELL
Absolutely

Mitchell moves ahead in his powerpoint Each technique has a
corresponding slide

MITCHELL
The attention grasp walling
facial hold

JESSEN
The facial slap or insult slap
cramped confinement wall standing
stress positions

MITCHELL
Sleep deprivation waterboarding

JESSEN
Use of insects and mock burials

Beat The room shifts uncomfortably

BERNADETTE
Well from my perspective this
seems like it could be a potential
game changer But of course it’s
up to Director Rodriguez--

JOSE
I think if we’re serious about
stopping the next threat we need
to put on our big boy pants and
provide the authorities these guys
need

JESSEN
These approaches might raise some
eyebrows at Defense--

JOSE
Well we’re not at Defense we’re
at the CIA Besides you just said
we use this SERE stuff on our own
guys all the time I don’t see a
problem

Mitchell and Jessen nod

INT OFF-SITE BASEMENT - WINDOWLESS ROOM - PRESENT

DANIEL JONES
Shortly after the CIA’s decision
to engage Dr Mitchell Abu
Zubaydah was moved to a cell that

was fed into his cell to disrupt
his sleep

JULIAN
What about the guy who got him
talking Ali Soufan

technique that works rapport
building You get close to these
guys and they open up But the
CIA didn’t believe that Just look
at Abu Zubaydah

DANIEL JONES
Well you got him to talk Howd
you do that

ALI
I walked in one day and played him
a tape of himself Most of it was
of a phone conversation -- we had
tapped his phones but he forgot to
hang up at the end of the call --
so we had all this background noise
of his house Then my partner
walked in with a big box full of
cassette tapes We told him we had
bugged his safe house We had been
listening for months We knew
everything so lying was pointless
He looked at the box full of tapes
and-

DANIEL JONES
And all the tapes were blank

ALI
Of course they were But he didn’t
know that So he talked

showed up

SUPER APRIL 2002

ALI
Who the fuck is this

BERNADETTE
Dr Mitchell is an Air Force
psychologist and he’s developed a
new method of interrogation

ALI

Why -- why do we need a new method
MITCHELL

He’s not telling you everything
BERNADETTE

We think he knows more -- we put

him at number 3 or number 4 in al-
Qaeda leadership -- he probably
knows the next move

ALI
Do you speak Arabic Jim Does Gary
here

MITCHELL

Don’t need to

ALI
Can I ask you something Have you
ever interrogated any sort of
extremist before Know much about
al-Qaeda

MITCHELL
Nope

ALI
Have you ever interrogated any sort
of terrorist before

MITCHELL

ALI
Any sort of criminal

MITHCELL
No

ALI
Have you ever interrogated anyone
before

MITCHELL

It’s not important He’s a human
I’m a psychologist He knows a
secret and I’m going to get him to

MITCHELL (CONT’D)
Seligman did an experiment with
dogs He put ‘em in a cage with a
barrier running down the middle --
one side of the cage was
electrified the other wasn’t At
first when he shocked the dogs
they’d jump over the barrier to get
away And then he electrified both
sides There’s no escape No belief
they could change anything He’d
open the door to the cage and they
wouldn’t even leave That’s learned
helplessness -- that’s what we’re
going to instill in this man

DANIEL JONES
What’d they say

ALT
They briefed Director Mueller and
told me to get the hell out of
there So I did

DANIEL JONES
When was that

ALI
Late May -- mid-May

DANIEL JONES
Because I’m finding records that
say that -- well Mitchell left a
little while later -- early June --
for R and R and some meetings at
headquarters But we had one high
value detainee in custody Abu
Zubaydah And after Mitchell left
the CIA put him in isolation and
didn’t ask him a single question
for 47 days

ALI
Are you fucking kidding me The
whole country was on red alert that
summer If they were so concerned
about the next attack -- why’d they
stop asking questions

almost nothing did anymore

EXT WASHINGTON MONUMENT DC - NIGHT

Late evening in the nation’s capital

INT SENATOR FEINSTEIN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Most employees have gone home for the day but Dan and
Senator Feinstein meet -- and discuss Zubaydah

DANIEL JONES
The CIA said Zubaydah was “involved
in every major terrorist operation
carried out by al-Qaeda” They told
the President he was number 3 or 4
in the organization

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Yes that was my understanding as
well

DANIEL JONES
And the claim that Zubaydah was a
major player was the main
justification they gave to the
Justice Department for needing to
go harder -- they were certain he
knew about the next attack

Dan hands Senator Feinstein some documents

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
(off his notes)

But last night I found this --
turns out Zubaydah wasn’t 3 or 4 in
the organization He wasn’t part of
al-Qaeda leadership at all They
only had one source calling him
that and that source later
admitted he was lying

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
So they exaggerated who he was to
the President and the Department of
Justice in order to get legal
approvals for these new techniques -
- is that what you’re saying

I think that’s a possibility The

SENATOR WHITEHOUSE’S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

Whitehouse lays on the couch in his office Dan briefs him

DANIEL JONES
As early as November 2001 the
CIAs legal team circulated a
memorandum describing a novel
legal defense for their officers
who might engage in torture

Dan hands

SENATOR WHITEHOUSE
C’mon They actually called it
torture The CIA They just forgot
we have laws against that

DANIEL JONES
Yes sir Mitchell and Jessen
renamed it “enhanced interrogation”
to help sell it but the Agency was
talking about doing it before they
even had a single detainee My
question Senator is how did the
CIA know they needed to torture
prisoners before they even had one

Senator Whitehouse a few documents and memos

SENATOR WHITEHOUSE
That didn’t come from Cheney and
Addington

DANIEL JONES
Seems like it happened the other
way around The CIA took it to the
Bush White House and John Yoo at
the Office of Legal Counsel

YOO (PRE-LAP)
So here’s where we’re at

INT DOJ - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

SUPER OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL JULY 2002

A group of LAWYERS discus how to make torture legal Rizzo

and Eastman from CIA JOHN YOO from the OFFICE of LEGAL
COUNSEL (OLC) and YOO’S ASSISTANT

YOO
The crime of torture -- as
described in Section 2340 --
requires that the defendant -- in
this case an interrogator --
intends to cause severe pain or
suffering But in this case that’s
not the interrogator’s intent

EASTMAN
Right The intent is to gain intel
Save American lives

Beat

RIZZO
But John what if the techniques
the interrogator employs do
nonetheless cause “pain” and
“suffering” -- how do we deal with
that

YOO
Well the key phrase is “severe
pain or suffering” But 2340 never
actually defines the term ‘severe’
We found this definition in a
Medicare statute Severe pain or
suffering “acute symptoms that
place the individual in serious
jeopardy and are hard to endure”

RIZZO
Meaning

YOO
To constitute torture the damage
done must rise to the level of
organ failure impairment of bodily
function or death

EASTMAN
So basically if someone dies
were doing it wrong

YOO
If the President deemed it
necessary to crush the testicles of
a child to stop a plane from
crashing into a building -- to save
American lives -- there is no law
or treaty that can stop him I can
make the same argument for gouging
out a prisoner’s eyes or dousing
him with acid

YOO (CONTD)
In our opinion if it provides
unique intelligence that saves
lives -- and doesn’t cause any
lasting harm -- then it’s legal for
the President to order it

EASTMAN
What do we mean when we say
“unique”

YOO
Intelligence that couldn’t have
been obtained any other way

RIZZO
And you’ve discussed all of this
with the White House I assume

recruit African American Muslims in
Montana to blow up gas stations and
start forest fires

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Montana Muslims in Montana

DANIEL JONES
The FBI had serious doubts as well
Later KSM admitted he just told
them what they wanted to hear to
make it stop

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
So did they get anything
actionable from him at all
Anything that saved lives

DANIEL JONES
They waterboarded him 183 times
and then concluded “KSM may never
be forthcoming or honest”
Everything they got from him was
either a lie or something they
already had

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Okay so my first question is if
it works why do you need to do it
183 times

DANIEL JONES
Maybe when the report comes out
people will finally see that

Kuwaiti had nothing to do with bin
Laden Same with KSM and the

Laden raid to intel obtained via

who cares what else it did If it
saved lives there’s no need for

for Director of the CIA Id like
to say from the beginning that
honesty -- truthfulness -- was a
value inculcated in me growing up

and Dorothy Now none of us are
perfect beings I am far from
perfect But I will be honest with
this Committee and do everything
possible to meet your legitimate
needs and requirements

SENATOR UDALL
Mr Brennan Ive long believed
that our government has an
obligation to the American people
to face its mistakes transparently
to help the public understand the
nature of those mistakes and to
correct them The enhanced
interrogation techniques were
brutal and perhaps most
importantly they did not work
Now the CIA has a responsibility
to correct any inaccurate
information it provided to the
previous White House the

and the public So heres my
question do you agree that the CIA
has this responsibility And Id
appreciate a yes or no answer

THE RESPONSE

DENIS (CONTD)
And

INT HART SENATE BUILDING - SCIF - DAY

BRENNAN
We acknowledge that the Detention
and Interrogation Program had
shortcomings and that the Agency
made mistakes The most serious of
those occurred early on and stemmed
from the fact that we were
unprepared Now as you know we
part ways on some key points
According to our review
indications are that interrogations
of detainees upon whom the enhanced
interrogation techniques were used
did produce unique intelligence
that helped thwart attack plans
capture terrorists and saved
lives
DANIEL JONES
Excuse me intelligence gathered
from EITs--

BRENNAN
And that intelligence continues to
inform our counterterrorism
efforts It led us to bin Laden
Now it’s one thing to disapprove
of the program -- I welcome that
conversation but it’s something
else all together to say that it
was mismanaged and ineffective

DANIEL JONES
Excuse me Director Brennan The
report is based on CIA records CIA
officers themselves called it
ineffective

BRENNAN
CIA officers Well you didn’t
speak to any CIA officers in the
program did you Dan

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Your lawyers would not make them
available to us because of the
Department of Justice’s criminal
inquiry

BRENNAN
We also disagree with the study’s
characterization of how the CIA
briefed Congress the White House
and the press Now we have
documentation that certainly proves
that--

DANIEL JONES
Excuse me sir what documents If
the Director is referencing cables
or emails we were never shown then
that’s a violation of our
agreement

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Everything was supposed to have
been provided to us--

BRENNAN
(fed up)
Do we just give the Committee
access to the entire CIA computer
system Is that where this goes
Dan gets to read every email gets
to see every document

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Every relevant document or email
yes I have always supported the
intelligence community I broke
with my own party to support the
drone program but what this report
makes very clear is a real need for
oversight and accountability

BRENNAN
You asked for our response and we
gave it to you -- we looked in the

mirror Now we made mistakes
There were abuses and those abuses
have been addressed But I
vehemently disagree with the
narrative that you’re trying to
string together here It lacks
context It does not paint an
accurate picture of the work that
was done

After the photos of Abu Ghraib came
out in 2004 Deputy Director
McLaughlin appeared before
Congress in front of you and
said “the CIA is not authorized to
do anything like what you’ve seen
in those photos” But what they
were doing was even worse Then in
2005 Senator Rockefeller called
for a review of the program and
the Deputy Chief of
Counterterrorism got nervous where
that might lead So he sent a
message to senior leadership
discussing the need to manage the
situation He said “we either get
out and sell or we get hammered
Congress reads it cuts our
authorities messes up our budget
We need to make sure the impression
of what we do is positive” This is

attribute to EITs they already had -
- from other sources from foreign
governments from other methods
They claim they saved lives but
what they really did was make it
impossible to prosecute a mass
murderer like KSM -- because if
what we did to him ever came out in
a court of law the case is over
The guy planned 911 -- and instead
of going to jail for the rest of
his life the CIA turned him into a
recruiting tool for a war we’re
still fighting

Krass to be General Counsel of the
CIA Welcome Ms Krass

KRASS
I’m honored to be here before the
Committee and I’d like to take
this moment to acknowledge my
family and thank them for their
support

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Thank you Before we begin I would
like to remind members not to
discuss classified topics or ask
questions which require a
classified answer With that said
I turn to Senator Udall

SENATOR UDALL

SENATOR UDALL (CONT’D)
Also last week a number of
articles appeared discussing the
one year anniversary of the vote to
approve the Committee’s study And
in one of those articles the CIA
claimed to have found significant
errors Now I gotta tell you -- I
don’t believe that is accurate In
fact I’m more confident than ever
in the factual accuracy of the
Committee’s study

crowd reacts

SENATOR UDALL (CONT’D)
I want to say that again I’m more
confident than ever It appears
that the CIA performed their own
study of the EIT program --
initiated by former Director
Panetta And the findings in that
review are entirely consistent with
our Committee’s report -- but
amazingly conflicts with the CIA’s
official response to that report

(MORE )

SENATOR UDALL (CONT’D)
So why is a review the CIA
conducted internally -- and never
revealed to Congress -- so
different from the CIA’s formal
response to the Committee’s report
Do you have an answer for that

KRASS
Um not at this time

Senator Feinstein looks over at Dan-- she knows he gave Udall
the ammunition

If I wanted the public to know
about the Panetta review I would

MARCY
We hear that the Republicans are
going to censure Udall for that
performance

DANIEL JONES
But the review proves our point --
they found the same things we did
The Agency didn’t know how or where
to hold people They didn’t know
how to interrogate people -- and
more importantly the CIA did give
it to us I don’t know if it was an
accident or it was a whistleblower--

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Well if it was a whistleblower
you may have just exposed them Not

EASTMAN
The Director has asked me here
today in my capacity as Agency
legal counsel What we have to
discuss has serious implications

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Alright

BRENNAN
We have proof that the staff of the
Senate Intelligence Committee
illegally gained access to the
CIAs computer network and obtained
classified documents

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
What kind of proof

BRENNAN
We found the document in question
on Daniel Jones’ computer We did
not provide it to him or to the
Committee If he didn’t hack us
how did it get there We feel that
Jones and his team need to be
disciplined
EASTMAN
Immediate dismissal is in order at
a minimum I would think

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
John are you saying that you broke
into the computer system of the
United States Senate

BRENNAN
We never gave you clearance on that
document -- it was classified yet

you chose to make it public We’ve
made our investigation and our
findings known to the White House

Senator Feinstein is in shock

Youre fucking kidding me They’re
saying I broke into the most top
secret computer system in the
world

Brennan and Eastman came over--

DANIEL JONES
Eastman Eastman’s name is in the
report over a thousand times
That’s not a conflict

MARCY
Dan they filed a criminal referral
against you They want you gone

DANIEL JONES
How did the Agency come to the
conclusion that I’m a hacker How
do they even know what’s on my
computer

MARCY
They say they conducted a search

DANIEL JONES
Of the United States Senate The
whole reason this Committee was
established in the first place was
to stop the CIA from spying on US
citizens--

MARCY
The Senator is talking to Harry
Reid about that very thing right
now--

DANIEL JONES
Did they go into that room

And Senator Reid said he’s That room is off-limits Did
reaching out to the they go into that fucking

do know the Republicans are going
to run with this They’re going to
use it to discredit the report
they’re going to use it to
discredit you

So did I just go over to Langley
and break in on a weekend

CLIFFORD
Seems unlikely So what evidence do
they have

DANIEL JONES
A document

CLIFFORD
A document What kind of a
document

DANIEL JONES
I can’t tell you that

CLIFFORD
Because what It’s classified

DANIEL JONES
I was tasked to lead an
investigation into a CIA program
they started after 911 -- what
they called “Enhanced
Interrogation”

CLIFFORD
And I assume your work is critical
of the Agency

Dan keeps quiet -- he can’t divulge the content of the
classified report
Beat

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
You know Dan a lot of people in
this country felt the CIA was
justified in doing whatever they
had to do to keep us safe I have
friends who lost people that day

DANIEL JONES
And a lot of people watch “24” on
Thursday nights and hear Jack Bauer
say “I don’t want to bypass the
Constitution but these are
extraordinary circumstances” just
before you know he sticks a knife
in them and makes them give up a
plot -- it doesn’t work that way

CLIFFORD
Well as Winston Churchill said
“history is written by the
victors”

DANIEL JONES
Churchill didn’t really say that --
Herman Goring did And what he said
was “we will go down in history
either as the world’s greatest
statesmen or its worst villains”

CLIFFORD
So your report is going to
determine that statesmen or
villains

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
How long have you been working on
this project Dan

DANIEL JONES
Five years

CLIFFORD
Five years and it could all go away
-- just vanish in the face of these
allegations I can certainly
imagine an ambitious young man like
yourself spends years with his head
buried in some terrible spectacle
gets frustrated with the process
sees an opportunity to get the
truth out faster -- maybe crosses a
line

(MORE )

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
I’m assuming this is the most
important thing you’ve ever been a
part of--

DANIEL JONES
I didn’t do it

CLIFFORD
Or I could see an equally
ambitious Senator encouraging you
to do something Now would be a
good time to tell me--

DANIEL JONES
That did not happen What I did I
did on my own I acted alone

CLIFFORD
So you did steal the document
DANIEL JONES CLIFFORD (CONTD)
I did not steal it You needed it to--

DANIEL JONES
I relocated it I put it in a safe
If they had a way of destroying
tapes then surely they could--

CLIFFORD
Everyone has their own words -- the
language is built to choose sides
Now why did you “relocate” it

DANIEL JONES
Documents had a way of disappearing
off the server For instance in
2010 over 800 documents just
vanished without any explanation

CLIFFORD
So you had computer issues all
along Who else knew what was on
the computers

DANIEL JONES
Well the CIA hired an outside firm
to vet the documents -- Centra And
CACI was also involved

CLIFFORD
Who are they

DANIEL JONES
Contractors but Jim Pavitt is on
their board

Clifford shrugs

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
Former Deputy Director of
Operations for the CIA Jim Pavitt -
- during the program Jim Pavitt

CLIFFORD
And is he named in the report

Dan stops himself

CLIFFORD (CONTD)
Can’t tell me So they can’t
destroy the document Then they
can go after the next best thing --
you Make you a zealot Anything
you touch is tainted I could see
the Agency saying this is a
violation of the Espionage Act the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act -- who
knows what else

Dan sits down for the first time the gravity of
situation hitting him

DANIEL JONES
And if they file a charge against
me how long could I go away for

CLIFFORD
I don’t know Twenty years -- maybe
more

Beat

DANIEL JONES
I did not hack into the CIA
computer system I mean my
computer skills stop at Microsoft
Word

CLIFFORD
They probably know that Let me ask
you something how much does a
Senate staffer make

DANIEL JONES
At my level About a hundred grand

the

CLIFFORD
Any retirement Savings Family
money

Dan shakes his head

DANIEL JONES
No no

CLIFFORD
So we should discuss my retainer

DANIEL JONES
How much is that

CLIFFORD
Thirty thousand to start And if it
goes to trial add a zero

That sinks in Dan swallows hard

than knowing you’re sitting here
talking to me That’s what they
want Dan Make you bleed money all

prosecute That’s their call not
ours Now when this administration
took office we faced the very real
possibility of economic collapse

spend our political capital on
going around trying to find people
to blame or do we solve the

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Maybe the way to solve the problem
is to hold people accountable Do
you ever wonder why history repeats
itself Well I think maybe it’s
because we don’t always listen the
first time

they have families There are
children who might lose a parent

program three days after taking
office The EITs what the CIA did
that is not our mess

INTERN
She’s expecting you

SENATOR FEINSTEIN (PRE-LAP)
So I just got a call from
Secretary of State Kerry

SENATOR FEINSTEIN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 170

Senator Feinstein Dan and Marcy The Senator is nervous

Dan--

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
He thinks that with the release of
the report that the coalition
against ISIL could collapse

DANIEL JONES
Isn’t that a bit convenient He
calls you just before--

MARCY DANIEL JONES (CONTD)
Where did Kerry get his intel
on this The CIA

DANIEL JONES (CONTD)
Is it credible

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Embassies could be attacked
hostages could be killed--

DANIEL JONES
It’s just another stall tactic--

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
He suggested giving the report to
the President so that it can be
released later when hostilities
cease--

DANIEL JONES
You lose control of the Committee
in a week Senator

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Yes I am aware of what happens
when the Republicans are in the
majority Dan

(MORE )

SENATOR FEINSTEIN (CONTD)
Look I want to get this report out
as much as anyone but I have known
him a long time I tend to believe
him

DANIEL JONES
Nobody else is going to tell this
story--

MARCY
Dan the Senator has a luncheon--

DANIEL JONES
If we stop now aren’t we a part of

the cover up Strong pills
Senator

Beat Senator Feinstein studies Dan weighing her options and
the consequences

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
I think you should go home and get
some rest You look tired Marcy
if I could have five minutes

MARCY
Of course

Dan bolts past Marcy for the door Senator Feinstein goes to
the window and looks out at the world

MATCH CUT TO

INT DANIEL JONES’ OFFICE - NIGHT

Dan stares at hard copies of the executive summary of the
report and the Panetta review both sitting on top of his
safe He’s tense weighing his options

INT HART SENATE BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Most people have gone home for the night Dan walks alone
with his bag over his shoulder -- a bag that contains the
report and the Panetta review

EXT DC STREET - LATE EVENING

Dan drives his car along the near-empty streets He puts on
his blinker and pulls into a parking garage

INT PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER 174

Dan pulls his car into a space and parks He exits his car
and walks to the passenger side door of a nearby parked car

INT EVAN TANNER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 175

Dan opens the door and gets in He has his shoulder bag on
his lap He’s visibly anxious

Evan nods

EVAN
Did you ever meet a guy called Greg
Craig

DANIEL JONES
Just in pass -- White House Counsel
when Obama took office

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
Just in passing

EVAN
Right So right after he got
elected the President asked Craig
to come up with a plan to deal with
the aftermath of the Torture
Program So he got Secretary of
Defense Gates Janet Napolitano

Hillary Clinton -- serious people --
in a room and he asked for their
recommendation

DANIEL JONES
And

EVAN
And the consensus was that the
President should appoint an
independent bipartisan commission
into interrogations and detainee
treatment like a deep dive into
what worked and what didn’t and who
was responsible You know like
what they did after 911 and like
what you’ve been trying to do

DANIEL JONES
So why didn’t they do that
Beat

EVAN
Well evidently the President
listened closely to the
recommendation He then thought
about it and then he said “no”
He’d just spent an entire campaign
saying he was post-partisan so
going after the Bush administration
flew in the face of all that And
right then everyone in that room
changed their minds They sided
with the President no independent
commission Everyone except Craig --
because he thought it was too
important You couldn’t just
torture people lie about it and
then hide it from history A few
months later Craig was gone and
this mess wound up with the Senate -
- and you

DANIEL JONES
Well the President must have known
that by doing that he was making
it next to impossible I mean he
came from the Senate

EVAN
Dan they sent you off to build a
boat but they had no intention of
sailing it They probably didn’t
think you’d get as far as you did

EVAN (CONTD)
Let me ask you a question If the
CIA knew that torture didn’t work
why did they continue to do it

DANIEL JONES
After 911 everyone was scared --
scared it might happen again and
the CIA would be blamed if it did
Or maybe they were ashamed You
know how come the most
sophisticated intelligence
organization on Earth couldn’t keep
its own people safe

(MORE )

DANIEL JONES (CONTD)
But fear and shame don’t make for
better policy decisions and the
fact that the people who we
captured didnt look like us or
believe the same things we do made
it that much easier to do the
things we did So once the CIA
program started they had to keep
telling people it worked even if
it wasn’t true Their own position
was that if it didnt work it was
illegal So they misrepresented the
results--

Dan stops himself

EVAN
If we had your report we would
print it tomorrow all of it

DANIEL JONES
The Senator said she would release
a summary of the report--

EVAN
Really Over the objections of the
CIA and the White House -- you

really think that’s gonna happen

DANIEL JONES
If I gave it to you what would
happen

Evan sighs

EVAN
Some people will think you’re a
hero and some will probably think
youre a traitor Look at Edward
Snowden

Beat Dan considers the line between patriot and traitor
Is he willing to cross it

DANIEL JONES
No If it’s gonna come out it’s
gonna come out the right way

EVAN
What if it doesn’t

DANIEL JONES
Then I didn’t do my job

Dan opens the car door

DANIEL JONES (CONT’D)
I’m sorry Sorry

176 INT DANIEL JONES’ OFFICE - NIGHT 176

Dan enters his office He turns on the light He kneels down
to his safe just as he had done after relocating the Panetta
review Dan unlocks the safe opens it and takes the
executive summary and the Panetta review out of his bag and
places them in the safe

177 EXT CAPITOL BUILDING - DC - MORNING 177

Snow on the ground in front of the Capitol

178 INT CAPITOL BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING 178

Denis McDonough flanked by Secret Service walks down the
hallway

They pass a sign DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN PROGRESS

DENIS (PRE-LAP)
So with the Affordable Care Act
behind us

179 INT MANSFIELD ROOM - CONTINUOUS 179

Democratic Senators sit alongside each other Dan sits in the
back of the room All watch Denis speak at the podium laying
out the Obama agenda for the coming term

DENIS
The President would like to begin a
serious discussion about
immigration reform Now obviously
weve had some setbacks in both the
House and the Senate so strategy
has become paramount -- unity as
well So we would like to really
start talking about--

SENATOR FEINSTEIN
Excuse me Mr McDonough I would
like to discuss the report on the
CIA and the White House’s position
DENIS
That’s not the topic of this
particular caucus The President
would like to discuss--

SENATOR HEINRICH
Our country did things the Nazis
did -- things that made us condemn
other regimes And the position of
this administration is to suppress
this information to keep the
people who did these things safe

DENIS
I can assure you that is not the
position of this administration
Senator

SENATOR ROCKEFELLER
You worked with John Brennan at the
National Security Council Now I
understand that Brennan gave this
President his first security
briefing when he took office And
now CIA Director Brennan is working
closely with the President on the
drone program

DENIS
You know it’s funny Every time
I go over to the CIA they claim
I’m doing the Senate’s bidding and
every time I come here you claim
I’m doing the CIA’s bidding

SENATOR UDALL

I only have a few days left in my
term here -- and if there isn’t a
plan to release the report before I
go I’m prepared to read it on the
floor of the Senate And either the
White House or the Republicans will
have to stop me

DENIS

What would you have us do Now we
go after Bush and Cheney on this
what’s to prevent the Republicans
from coming back at us and trying
to repeal healthcare We go after
the CIA maybe they say “okay
well immigration reform is off the
table” Maybe it’s gun control
(MORE )

DENIS (CONTD)

Now Democracy is messy but let’s
just think how many countries there

are

in the world where a report

like this could even get done

Senator Feinstein looks back at Dan Then to Denis

SENATOR FEINSTEIN

I would like us to be more than the
country that did the report I’d
like us to be the country that made
it public And that is what I
intend to see happen

EXT CAPITOL BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY

US SENATOR (PRE-LAP)

I yield the floor to the Senior
Senator from California

INT SENATE FLOOR - DAY

Senator Feinstein makes her way to the lectern Dan sits in
the back of the Senate Chamber

SENATOR FEINSTEIN

Over the past six years a small
team of investigators poured over
more than 63 million pages of CIA
records to complete this report It
shows that the CIA’s actions a
decade ago are a stain on our
values and on our history The
release of this 500 page summary
cannot remove that stain but it

can
the

and does say to our people and
world that America is big

enough to admit when it’s wrong and
confident enough to learn from its

mis

takes Releasing this report is

an important step toward restoring

our
tha

values and showing the world
t we are in fact a just and

lawful society There are those who
will seize upon the report and say
“see what the Americans did” And
they will try to use it to justify
evil actions or to incite more
violence

(MORE)
Beat

SENATOR FEINSTEIN (CONTD)
We cannot prevent that but history
will judge us by our commitment to
a just society governed by law and
the willingness to face an ugly
truth and say “never again”

SENATOR FEINSTEIN (CONT’D)
Thank you I now yield the floor to
the Senator from Arizona

INT DIRECTOR BRENNAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Brennan and Krass watch McCain’s speech on TV

MCCAIN (TV)
What might come as a surprise is
how little these practices did to
aid our efforts to bring 911
culprits to justice and to find and
prevent terrorist attacks today and
tomorrow That could be a real
surprise since it contradicts the
Many assurances provided by
intelligence officials on the
record and in private that enhanced
interrogation techniques were
indispensable in the war against
terrorism

INT CTC CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bernadette Gretchen Eastman and other CIA officers and
analysts gather to watch McCain

INT WHITE HOUSE - MCDONOUGH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MCCAIN (TV)
I think it’s an insult to the many
intelligence officers who have
acquired good intelligence without
hurting or degrading prisoners to
assert we can’t win this war
without such methods Yes we can
and we will

Dennis also watching McCain

MCCAIN (TV)
But in the end torture’s failure
to serve its intended purpose isnt
the main reason to oppose its use

Denis stands from his desk and walks toward the window

MCCAIN (TV) (CONTD)
This question isnt about our
enemies it’s about us It’s about
who we were who we are and who we
aspire to be It’s about how we
represent ourselves to the world
Our enemies act without conscience
We must not

Denis stares out his window

INT DANIEL JONES’ OFFICE - LATER
Newspapers from all over the country and the world cover
Dan’s desk all with headlines concerning the report the
CIA and the torture program Dan types at his computer The
news is on in the background
RACHEL MADDOW (TV)

Senator Dianne Feinstein today

exposed the CIA’s now extinct

enhanced interrogation techniques

The thing that strikes me about

what the Senate was doing today --

Dianne Feinstein Jay Rockefeller --

is they were doing everything they

can to make sure this doesnt

happen again Because by going

public like this and putting this

report out there
Senator Feinstein appears in the doorway

RACHEL MADDOW (TV) (CONT’D) SENATOR FEINSTEIN

Its saying to the current Dan you did well Thank you

CIA and really saying to the
next 20 years of people going
to work at the CIA
