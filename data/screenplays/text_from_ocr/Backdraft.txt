crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage
as we hear two children arguing

OLDER KID

Its hard but we get a sense of the room in the

beam of light Huge dark coats lined up like sides of
on steel batons Bent stained helmets hung like
masks

Beneath them BRIAN 7 and STEPHEN 12 are trying to

into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their
pajamas

STEPHEN
It doesnt go like that

EXT BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS EARLIER

Theres a level of apartments above the storefronts As
watches a window opens and out steps his father and
onto a small fire escape Their attentions on the next
over out of reach wrapped in leaky smoke

Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing
with only an axe and JUMPS across to the next metal

A ballsy dangerous move He kicks in the window

the frame with his axe and dives in

A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a

smudged little girl He hands the little girl over the
to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way --
ladder

Denniss face lifts and grins at Brian dirty bigger

life invincible He winks a wink only possible between
fathers and sons and hes gone again back into the

darkness As Brian stands there full of love full of

staring up in astonishment

Nobody else has noticed it

Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window
probing looking for the flame lurking just above

starts to call out in a small hesitant voice

BRIAN
Dad

He tries to call louder But suddenly everything is
happening very fast in slow motion

-- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike

as Brian steps forward under the power of a flame that
beckons him as --

Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox knocking
clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the
fully against him as -- All the buildings windows BLOW
and its like the skys erupted for Brian a burning
that falls and pelts the ground around him Plaster
and something metal that cracks against the pavement
spins slowly
A fire helmet
And Adcox is coming out the door now blackened and
hopeless tears streaming down his face
AXE

Get us some backup We need some

goddamn backup
And spotting Brian he runs towards him And the

spins and spins and Adcox keeps running and the sky is

At the same moment part of the floor beside a heavy
sewing

machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman SANTOS FALLS
THROUGH

grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW
UP

from underneath He SCREAMS as his grip loosens

Grindle leaps to the laddermans side grabbing his

SHOVES him

out of the way to back up Grindle

SANTOS
Help Oh God

Adcoxs taken the hoseline and is opening fire Water

curdling

ROAR Its a thrashing murderous standoff

Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angles

Alderman Swayzak

SWAYZAK
Investigator Rimgale

SHADOW
I need to get in the trunk

Swayzaks leaning on it We sense the dislike between
them
Swayzak steps aside Rimgale pops the trunk

SHADOW
Awful expensive shoes to be wearing
at a fireground Alderman But then
I guess you havent been to too many
fires

JENNIFER
I wanted to talk to you about Alan
Seagraves death We still havent
gotten a fire report from your office

SHADOW
Youll have an answer as soon as I
do

SWAYZAK

People are asking how a prominent
taxpayer got stuffed through the
windshield of his own car Theyre
asking me

JENNIFER
--The point is Investigator you
havent even told us yet if the fire
was accidental Were starting to
get the feeling your office is
dragging out this case to embarrass
the Alderman because of his fire
dept reorganization program --

SHADOW
-- You mean his firehouse closing
program -- Dont you

JENNIFER

Wed just be very disappointed if it
turned out your office was playing
politics

SWAYZAK
-- Because Im not I care about
this city and I care about this
department --

Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk
lid

SHADOW

(calm of a monk)
Alderman I have a remarkably
uncomplicated job To decide if a
fires arson and if so catch the
pain in the ass doing it But to be
honest if my methodical investigative
methods just happen to muck up the
campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees
well I guess I cant say I sleep
any less peacefully

And he walks back to the burned building

SWAYZAK
I wish I could just fire the son of
a bitch

STEPHEN
Hey Swayzak

Stephens leaning out of an upstairs window As the TV
cameras

turn he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and
POps

right into Swayzaks face with a murderous grin

STEPHEN
We almost lost a whole company up
there Swayzee buddy Isnt any back-
up since you closed 33 And we really
appreciate it the guys and me
Honest I know youve got my vote
for mayor

Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen Brians
there
following after them

SWAYZAK

STEPHEN
Oh yeah your famous task force

year because of the cuts made by
your task force

GRINDLE

Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand
Swayzak
leans close out of earshot of the cameras

SWAYZAK
You see that funny glow thats
starting to blink in the corner of
your eye Lt Thats your career
dissipation light -- and it just
went into overtime

STEPHEN
If anybodys lights gonna blink
its yours

Swayzak holds his ground Its a tense out of control
moment

between them Rimgale turns from his work watches
Stephen

with concern Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-
face

with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred

working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered

On the wall is a small glass case full of station

set reverently on velvet Beside it is a photograph of

Gentlemen please As 17s official
toastmaster --

SANTOS

And bullshitter

AXE
Thank you Santos Did I happen to
mention that you were cut out of my
will
(company laughs)
I think it appropriate that we
recognize the two asswipes -- I mean
probationary firemen -- among us who
today were baptized officially into
the world of Old Man Fire First to
Tim who despite being handicapped
at birth with a rather dull expression
and a really hideous pair of ears
not only took on the beast but pulled
from its clutches -- assisted by a
more famous and brilliant firefighter --
me -- a kicking and screaming civilian
that will probably end up suing us
for breaking her fingernail

(laughs)
And to Brian whos own contribution
was both more beautiful and less
likely to sue

Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin
seated

with honor at the head of the table Right beside The
Thing

AXE

Yknow when I heard that both
McCaffrey brothers were going to be
assigned together here well my
heart was filled with a sudden
desire to transfer

(laughs)
So raise a glass lads To funny-
looking Tim and the McCaffrey
brothers who despite years of getting
on each others nerves have managed
with great effort to still be
pissed off at each other Gentlemen

Brian sees Jennifer across the room She looks great
as she expertly works the room schmoozing and hugging
calling various politicos by their first name

As she speaks to one a waiter offers a drink As she

a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with

syrup

BRIAN

interrupting)
With grenadine right

JENNIFER
When I was twenty

BRIAN
Oooh very sophisticated Having
fun

at

him

nothing better to do than wrap her
legs around you on a Saturday night
This isnt about fun Im working

BRIAN
Carrying Swayzaks notebook

BRIAN
-- All I know is that his programs
are getting firemen hurt

JENNIFER
Bullshit Martys plan is only about
efficiency Ive got two cousins on

Jennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed COUPLE
passes

Martyll be very happy you came
Thanks so much for the donation

just as
fast back to their argument

JENNIFER

BRIAN
What was that Oh man you have picked
up a few moves since John Paul II

Litwalks barf in the planters

BRIAN

nights on JP II

Brian turns and walks away
ACROSS THE ROOM

Adcox is talking with another knot of firemen Hes
brought

a date SALLY a hot little number that has a habit of

standing on her tip-toes when she talks

across room)
Yuck what a scumbag

firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine

GRINDLE
Aw I dont believe this shit

SCHMIDT
Somebody get a shovel You seen this
Stephen

As they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread
titled
DARING FIRE RESCUE

The first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning

building with seemingly a woman in his arms The second
photo

shows the backs of Adcox and Tims helmets as they

administered aid to the real woman they saved The
implication

is its the same woman

BRIAN
What

TIM

(reads)
Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey
on his very first fire showed the
kind of bravery and courage of a
veteran firefighter when he risked
life and limb to double-check a
burning floor alone emerging
victoriously with Anna Rodriguez a
seamstress for the North Shore
Clothing Company McCaffrey first
gained prominence as the subject of
a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning
photograph taken at the scene of his
fathers death

The old photo is there too Brian and his dads helmet

GRINDLE
Whadda we gonna do about this

Stephen glances over the headlines

STEPHEN
Yknow I think its a union bylaw
that if a guy gets in the paper --
especially if its bullshit -- he
owes the company a drink In fact
(motions to waiter)
-Ill have a double On the hero

The other firemen jump in with drink orders Dozens of
them

BRIAN
(confused)

Tim shows him the magazine Brian reads with horror as
Alderman Swayzak appears beside him

representing us An authentic hero
from a traditional firefighting clan

BRIAN
Yeah we got all kinds of traditions --
like dying young

SWAYZAK
Not every job in the fire department
comes with a tombstone Brian This
could be a great opportunity to
move beyond a fire engine

Brian looks at Jennifer then smiles at Swayzak

BRIAN
Thanks anyway Mr Swayzak but fire

Temperature in this room was about

outlet is melted which requires

wire and start a fire

No it couldnt

Rimgale shuts off the recorder Stares down Brian

BRIAN

I mean youd be right -- with normal
wire But thats gauge ten in that
plug -- industrial stuff Who knows
why they put it in here -- but it
wont melt at less than 12000
degrees And no natural spark short
of lightning gets that hot

A Lab Tech RICCO leads Brian and Rimgale through the
area till they come on two corpses lying side by side
in plastic
RICCO
Okay Alan Seagrave and Donald
Cosgrove

If you say so Brians stomach does a half-gainer as

confronted by two hideously charred bodies
RICCO
-Both deaths due to close encounters
with stationary objects office door
for Mr Cosgrove 89 Porsche for
Mr Seagrave No non-relevant traumas
No significant blood toxicology
Attitude of both trajectories
consistent with explosions

Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze whistling
quietly to
himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf

RICCO
They ran the residue you scraped
from both crispers front doors
Its a combination of plumbers putty
and rayophene gum Burns almost
completely away when you light it

SHADOW
Putty On both doors

RICCO
Theres something else kinda
interesting

Ricco lifts Bentons charred shoulder Underneath we
see

some of his clothes that have melted and co-mingled
with his

flesh

RICCO
See this

A credit card has been fried right into Cosgroves skin
about
where his back pocket should have been

RICCO
Guess he didnt leave home without
it

Ricco erupts in a honking laugh then switches
instantly
back to a business tone

RICCO
Anyway down here take a look
SHADOW
McCaffrey hold this for us

BRIAN
Uh I dont think thats in my
contract

SHADOW
I just re-wrote your contract
Cmere

With supreme reluctance Brian pulls the crispers head
and
shoulder away from the table

RICCO
Jesus Christ he isnt gonna try to
sell you insurance lift him

Brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher

RICCO

(to Rimgale)
See that patch of shirt We wondered
about the discoloration so he ran a
spectro On a lucky shot we picked
up some traces of Trychticholorate
Nobody around here had ever heard of
it

SHADOW
Trychticholorate Alright its an
absorption catalyst in toxic waste
accidents Its pretty rare they
stopped making it a couplea years
ago

RICCO
Probably got in Cosgroves clothes
in a gas state from the fire

SHADOW
What the hell was it doing in the
fire

RICCO
Thats your job

At that instant Cosgroves eyes OPEN and his body
SIGHS
Brian DROPS the body in shock and backs away stunned
SHADOW
I asked you to hold him not feel
him up

INT RIMGALES CAR - DAY

Rimgales FD sedan Brian is still wringing imaginary
g

guts
off his hands Rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in
his
lap
SHADOW
Read
BRIAN
Trychtichlorate is a binary
structured --
SHADOW
-- Go to the bottom Under heat
properties
BRIAN
During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin
or higher Trych breaks down and
dissipates Will consume magnesium
SHADOW
Ever burned magnesium Its so hot
it takes water molecules and BAMM
Rimgale CLAPS his hands next to Brians head STARTLING
him

SHADOW
Son of a bitch tears em apart just
to eat the oxygen Wouldnt take
much at all to melt ten gauge wire
Problems burnt magnesium leaves a

powder trace -- unless you could
find something that would eat its
residue

BRIAN

Trychticholorate Then Swayzak can
announce Seagrave was a murder

Rimgale looks at Brian Hes getting tired of this

SHADOW
Look it isnt proof okay Someone
may have put the chemical in the
outlet but we found it as a vapor
in Cosgroves clothes

BRIAN
And the putty around the door

SHADOW
Even if it was used to seal the air
off that doesnt explain why someone
would go to the trouble of a
backdraft A guns a helluva lot
easier

BRIAN
But the right guess on this is arson

SHADOW
I dont guess

BRIAN
Some people say you dont do much of
anything when it comes to this case

SHADOW
I dont work for them either

Rimgales grinning like a little kid

SHADOW
Thats it Oh that son of a bitch
hes different goddamn it You see
what this tells us huh Our killer
doesnt love fire

BRIAN
What

SHADOW

(pulls out file)
I got it after we talked to Ronald
Torches Want to fry the whole goddamn
world But the fires that killed
those guys never really burned up
much -- The burns were all lit in
outlets surrounded by double
firebreaks in the walls And he made
his burns backdrafts

(p 78)

BRIAN
But he killed these guys

SHADOW
But he could have killed everybody
there The firebreaks kept it from
spreading in the wall The backdraft
blew out the flame Thats it Thats
the reason

BRIAN
What reason

SHADOW

Why backdrafts Whoever fried Seagrave
and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot

of trouble to make sure they died by
fire but also made sure the fire

blew itself out

BRIAN
Thats why the sealant on the doors
So what have we got a torch with a
conscience

No we have a stone killer trying to
make a point

not

BRIAN

Jesus give him a break There isnt
enough proof yet to go public Sure
we found some chemical shit we think
somebody dumped in the plugs to torch
em and weve maybe figured out why

all about

Rimgale drops the match
WUMP A small flame explodes to life

SHADOW
Its a living thing Brian It
breathes it eats and it hates

The fires climbing a wall chewing a corner

The only way to beat it is to think
like it To know that this flame
will spread this way across the floor
not because of the physics of
flammable liquids or heat convection
but because it wants to

FWUMP It darts west Licks the ceiling The fire purrs
and
hisses Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely

them It makes them fight on its
level But the only way to truly
kill it is to love it a little just
like Ronald

different comes into Brians eyes

as

the neck of the extinguisher against the pole BREAKING
off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the

where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder
STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash

and TACKLE the hose

The fire shakes off the powder rises up to kill --

Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM

-- And its like a howling train wreck as the two
with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an
and theyre dashing for the catwalk ladder up to
because the fire doesnt care -- it only has eyes for

-- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster and his

fill with tears --

-- And the fires pushing Brian -- pushing him with the
of a frightened street bully -- but Brian wont give --
now the fires backs broken -- its whimpering dying

And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen
pulling him away
STEPHEN

And the fires just a little gremlin now sighing sadly

Brian steps up with the hoseline
