INT LEECH LAKE WOMENS CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY

ANITA NEEDY LESNICKI 17 sits on her hospital bed in
pajamas Shes a plain-faced girl with a haunted
expression As she stares out the window she winds
colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
gods eye

Out a single window we see an imposing nine-foot
SECURITY FENCE

Next to Needy we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
casually on the floor There are letters packages even
creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring fans

NEEDY VO
Every day I get letters I think
I get more letters than Santa
Claus Zac Efron and Dr Phil
combined Im kind of the shit

RAYMUNDO a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
head in cautiously

RAYMUNDO
Rec time in five minutes Needy

NEEDY
Grassy-ass Raymundo

Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
gym uniform As she slips off her pajamas we can see a
series of puffy slash-like SCARS on her body

NEEDY VO
Sometimes the letters are from
people who say theyre praying for
me They tell me everything will
be okay if I just accept Jesus
Christ into my heart I say the
words but nothing ever happens
Nobody comes back Nobody gets off
the cross

She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser She
touches the frame wistfully her eyes full of remorse

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Occasionally I get presents from
starfuckers who saw my picture in
the paper and want to marry me or
something They think they can
take me away from all this

(MORE )

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Like Id really date some
perverted Chester with a hard-on
for jailbait I might be insane
but Im not desperate

We see a morbid hall of fame of creepy photos sent in
from guys They line the mirror grinning at us Theres
even a DICK SHOT tucked in there

Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt It hangs
down to her knees covering her shorts

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
A lot of people ask me if Im
sorry I did it

Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
dresser dumps the meds into her mouth and dry-swallows
them

NEEDY
(ALOUD)
Im sorry I didnt do it sooner

She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNY
SLIPPERS
INT LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNING

Several badminton courts are set up in the gym As an
intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
system the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks

The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy A
TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket
clipping her partner in the leg In the corner one
forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
hurls her racket against the wall again and again
Counselors look on approvingly despite how miserable
their charges appear In the background a few sulking
patients jump rope

Needy enters the gym unnoticed padding along in her
bunny slippers

NEEDY VO
Welcome to the Mental Olympics
Theyre big on recreation here
Supposedly it helps us vent our
aggressions Weve traded in our
hatchets for rackets our Drain-O
bombs for double dutch

(MORE )

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Even the cutters get in on the
action when theyre fully
conscious

We see a GIRL swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of
fresh bandages on her arms and legs
NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Me Im just trying to stay
invisible

Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious
WHACK at it

INT LEECH LAKE CAFETERIA - ONE HOUR LATER
The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast
They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques Needy
selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
and sits down alone
NEEDY VO
Personally I think theyre trying
to wear us out Keep us sluggish

so there wont be an uprising
Well those JV tactics wont

work against me Ima kicker K-I-
C-K-E-R It even says so on my
chart

We briefly cut to Needys chart on some doctors
clipboard We see her name ANITA NEEDY LESNICKI and a
few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
NOTIONS Beneath that we see a triple-highlighted
warning in bright ink KICKER

A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
and eyes her breakfast plate

NUTRITIONIST
Just one Toastem huh
NEEDY
(QUIETLY)

I like Toastems

NUTRITIONIST
Thats good But Im not sure a
Toastem can provide you with
sufficient energy for your day
Id recommend more complex
carbohydrates

Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden
powerful ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the nutritionists face
NEEDY
ID RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE

FUCK UP

The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if shes
been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
collapses clutching her bleeding nose We see that the
bone has SNAPPED

The patients shriek Chaos As Needy is restrained by
staff members she thrashes like a trapped fish

Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
nutritionist The glob nails her in the eye

It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she
hollers in protest

The nutritionist curls up on the floor cupping her
bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds
her She spits out a TOOTH

INT THE HOLE - SAME
Needy is tossed into seclusion Her hair is wild and her
face is wet with tears The heavy door slams behind her
leaving only a shaft of light
NEEDY VO

I wasnt always this cracked I

used to be normal-- well as

normal as any girl under the

influence of teenage hormones But

after the killings began I

started to feel I dont know

loose around the edges or

something I was coming undone

like those jeans I made in Home

Ec Falling to pieces like Patsy

Cline Shredded like moo-shu pork

Dead inside
Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
in the darkness Grinning skulls Faces drained of life
half eaten Grimaces of terror
Suddenly soft music is piped into the hole ostensibly
to calm the patients in solitary Needy shudders and
recoils at the sound of it Its a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
that well soon hear again

CHEESY SONG LYRICS
Through the trees will find
you Heal the ruins left inside
you And the stars will remind
you well meet again

NEEDY VO
God I hate this fucking song

Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to
listen to the song She curls up in the corner and steels
herself for solitary confinement

DISSOLVE TO
TITLE TWO MONTHS EARLIER

EXT DEVILS KETTLE MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)

Devils Kettle is a quiet farming community surrounded
by dense woods and mirrored lakes Its the kind of town
that has one high school one pizza joint and one
stoplight
On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
reads WELCOME TO DEVILS KETTLE- Pop 7036 Come See
Whats Cookin
NEEDY

This is where it all went down

Devils Kettle sounds twisted I

know but the place just is named

after a dumb waterfall

EXT THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
We see the titular falls surprisingly powerful gushing
over a rock face
NEEDY VO
Well technically its two
waterfalls One of them is normal--
it empties into a river basin But
the other one goes into a hole
And it doesnt come out The
scientist guys cant explain it
Theyve dropped all kinds of
things down there--bouncy balls
red dye radioactive slime-- but
nothing ever surfaces
(MORE )

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Maybe its another dimension Or
you know just really deep

EXT JENNIFERS HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MIDNIGHT
The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except
for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifers-- still
illuminated
Theres a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
backyard Were definitely in deep north country
NEEDY VO

Ive probably spent years of my

life in this house Hundreds of

sleepovers thousands of aimless

homework sessions a million phone

calls Ive climbed through

Jennifers window so many times

But tonight only one of us is

going to come out

INT JENNIFERS BEDROOM - SAME
JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed fidgeting as she watches
TV Shes a girl of 16 with LONG MATTED HAIR and a thin
frail body Her features are gorgeous but she looks sick
and haggard She picks at her skin with yellowed
Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
of hair

Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH
FLAGS and underwear

An 80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV Jennifer half-
watches distracted
NEEDY VO
Jennifer didnt always look this
rough Actually she was the
prettiest girl in Devils Kettle
when she wasnt sohungry

Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer
was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
She hadnt fed in weeks

Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly

We see the OUTSIDE of the house again Its dark and

silent but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs

Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV

Suddenly we see NEEDYS FACE pop up against the window
white and startling Before Jennifer notices the face
disappears

Outside the house the bushes rustle Needy is crouched
below the window We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
via ultrasound Its a wet rhythmic sound Sploish
sploish sploish

Inside Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV She
turns out the light A beat of silence
Then the sound of cracking near the window

JENNIFER

Huh

Needy PLUNGES through the window screaming and
brandishing a HAMMER She takes a SWING at Jennifers
head but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL specifically
in Jennifers Fall Out Boy poster
Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer She STRADDLES
Jennifer and grips her throat throttling her

NEEDY
Youll throw me a bone huh Huh
You killed Chip You goddamned
monster YouZOMBITCH

Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness
Her clawlike fingernails rake Needys back and arms

Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks
it open like a switchblade Kshink

JENNIFER
(GAGGING)
Do you buy all your murder weapons
at Home Depot God youre butch

NEEDY

now what this is for Cutting
boxes
She takes a swipe at Jennifers CROTCH Jennifer
instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense
We see Jennifers mouth come down on Needys neck Needy
shrieks as if BITTEN but continues to strangle Jennifer
straddling her and bearing down

Jennifers T-shirt slides up to her armpits exposing her
breasts For a moment her eyes meet Needys and she
grins Its as if she has control over Needy for a split
second sexual control
Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifers body left and right
with the box-cutter marking a gory oozing X on her
torso
NEEDY (CONTD)
(HYSTERICAL)
CROSS OUT JENNIFER
Jennifer gasps staring at her wounds in shock and
disbelief She looks back up at Needy A beat of silence
Suddenly THE GIRLS BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
CEILING They wrestle in a bloody screaming airborne
heap their figures entwined Their bodies FALL
collapsing back onto the bed with a thud

Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into
Jennifers HEART Blood GEYSERS from the wound

JENNIFER
(CHOKING)
My tit
Suddenly the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT
revealing a Needy straddling Jennifers MUTLIATED BODY
Jennifers breathing is a raspy death rattle
MRS CHECK a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a
worse perm rushes into the bedroom
MRS CHECK
Jennifer What is it baby Oh my
God Oh my God
She pulls Needy off her daughter Jennifer rolls over
gasping and bleeding
MRS CHECK (CONTD)
(SHOCKED )
Needy
Needy drops the boxcutter It lands on Jennifers copy of
Flag Team Quarterly splashing the model with fresh gore

NEEDY
Is she dead Mrs Check Did I get
her

Mrs Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like
a white-trash Pieta Jennifer takes one last breath
vomits blood and DIES

Mrs Check SCREAMS Needy SMILES

EXT JENNIFER CHECKS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and
lights engaged OFFICER ROMAN DUDA 22 a muscular young
COP jogs authoritatively toward the house He shakes his
head dumbfounded

ROMAN
Christ Needy what have you done

INT POLICE SQUAD CAR - DAWN
Needy innocent-looking in PIGTAILS is hustled into the
back of the squad car Her clothes and face are smeared
with blood
Officer Duda starts the ignition His partner a hard-
faced FEMALE COP slides into the front seat Her cap is
pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of
shellacked MALL BANGS
NEEDY
Hi Roman Hows the Force
treating you I like that jaunty
cap Blue like your balls
ROMAN
How could you do this Needy
(EMOTIONAL)

You killed Jen-- Jennifer-- I

NEEDY
Everythings going to be okay now

FEMALE COP
Shut your mouth back there

NEEDY
Hey Didnt you used to baby-sit
me in like 1998 When my mom
worked the overnight at Hormel

The female cop fidgets uncomfortably

NEEDY (CONTD)
Yeah Gracie right Gracie I
really like your hair Gracie How
many cans of Salon Selectives did
it take to erect that monument
The cop reaches into the backseat and SLAPS Needy who
hiccups with laughter
NEEDY (CONTD)
Watch it Puffy Combs Thats
police brutality
FEMALE COP
Youre one to talk about
brutality Ms Lesnicki Youre
looking at attempted murder

NEEDY
Ugh dont say attempted That
sounds so JV Small time Teeny-
weeny just like Officer Duda up
there And trust me-- Id know
Roman swallows nervously eyes on the road Officer
Warzak glances at him

NEEDY (CONTD)
Lets get our facts straight I
successfully committed a hard
core fully premeditated murder
back there I fucking destroyed
that brat OK I Needy Lesnicki
put a stop-payment on Jennifer
Check

She slumps down in the backseat

NEEDY (CONTD)
Why am I even in these cuffs I
just saved every guy in this town
from becoming Satan Chow Ima
hero

FEMALE COP
Shes delirious

ROMAN

(MUTTERING)

This is going to be a circus

FEMALE COP
At least weve already got a
confession

NEEDY
Confessions are for pussies
Youve got a declaration Grace

She giggles maniacally

Roman turns on the radio violating protocol
soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped

into solitary confinement

Both cops

BRIGHTEN when they hear the song

Roman cranks the volume

Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the

uplifting

ROMAN
God I love this song
FEMALE COP
I know And theyve done so much
for this town

ROMAN
Theyre way more than a band
really Theyre heroes

FEMALE COP
Wait this is my favorite part

corny song

FEMALE COP AND ROMAN
(in unison)
Through the trees I will find
you Heal the ruins left inside
you And the stars will remind
you that you are home

Its a

Needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over
the forest on the horizon
NEEDY VO
So I killed her Whatever It
wont undo anything Three pulses--
three lives-- all stopped cold by
adolescent bloodlust Its hard to
believe that just two months ago
me Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip
were completely normal people
(MORE )

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
We were our yearbook pictures
Nothing more nothing less

We see a brief montage of black-and-white yearbook
stills JENNIFER executing the splits on a football
field her smile bright NEEDY inspecting a school
newspaper layout pen in hand glasses on her nose And
finally CHIP DOVE playing a strap-on snare drum at a
school pep rally his head bent in concentration

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Jesus Chip

The photo fades into the pep rally itself CHIP is
animated drumming in full color

INT KETTLE HIGH - DAY
CHIP drums on the sidelines of the Devils Kettle High
basketball court The stands are packed with BORED
STUDENTS for a pep rally Chip is 16 clean cut and an
awful drummer
NEEDY VO

Chip couldnt drum for shit He

only knew Land of a Thousand

Dances and the solo from

Wipeout Lucky for him the pep

band gig wasnt too demanding

Sure enough the band is playing Land of a Thousand
Dances Nearby the FLAG TEAM claps with gloved hands
picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt

Jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform
breathtakingly beautiful She hoists her flag aloft
twirling it Time FREEZES as the flag unfurls
NEEDY VO (CONTD)
If you can believe it thats
Jennifer Yeah the same girl I
iced with the box-cutter Only
back then we were tight Sisters
practically People found it hard
to believe that a babe like
Jennifer would associate with a
dork like me But wed been the
Wonder Twins since we were
practically preverbal Sandbox
love never dies

Jennifer finishes her maneuver and WAVES to the stands
Needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers

small and owlish with glasses and lank hair

CHASTITY a similarly geeky-looking girl standing next to
Needy rolls her eyes at this display of affection
CHASTITY
Youre totally lesbigay
NEEDY
What Shes my best friend
The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needys excited wave
CHASTITY
You stare at her like you want to
dry hump her
Needy ignores her
CHASTITY (CONTD)
Like hump her through pants
NEEDY
(INTERRUPTING)
Are you jealous

CHASTITY
Of what That rich bitch
NEEDY
Shes not rich

INT KETTLE HIGH HALLWAY - AFTER SCHOOL
Needy digs through her locker carefully selecting
textbooks to take home Jennifer skips up to her
smiling
JENNIFER
Hey Monistat

JENNIFER

She checks herself out in Needys locker mirror

NEEDY

Minnesota Duluth- woo
Needy continues loading her backpack
JENNIFER (CONTD)
Please please youre a social
disease
NEEDY

Jennifer pouts With an outstretched finger she draws a
dramatic X in the air over Needy and boos loudly
JENNIFER
(SHOUTING)
Boo Cross out Needy

Needy blushes shrinking self-consciously She obviously
hates to displease Jennifer
NEEDY
Fine What time is the show
JENNIFER

the ham store

NEEDY
He seems nice

JENNIFER
(SMIRKING)

Yeah Mom says hes got a huge
heart So huge he gave her a
recurring bladder infection Wear

NEEDY
Okay

INT NEEDYS HOUSE - 845 AM

Needy is standing in a small dingy bathroom trying on

different configurations of clothing

NEEDY VO

Wear something cool meant
something very specific in
Jennifer-speak It meant I
couldnt look like a nerd but I
couldnt upstage her either I
could expose my stomach but never
cleavage Tits were her trademark

Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower exposing her
childishly round tummy She walks out of the bathroom
into her bedroom a frilly pink hell complete with canopy
bed
CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed looking lost in all that
pink He raises an eyebrow at Needys abdomen
CHIP
Those jeans are hella low I can
almost see your front butt
NEEDY
Chip its a rock show This is my
rock look

CHIP
I can see like your womb
Needy sighs and hoists up her pants
CHIP (CONTD)
Why are you blowing me off for
some dumb concert anyway We were
supposed to have Movie Night I
even rented Orca Its like Jaws
except with a harmless whale

NEEDY
Jennifer needs me She really
wants to go see this band Its
extremely important to her

CHIP
Ive never even heard of Soft
Shoulder Which one is Jennifer

NEEDY
The lead singer of course Girls

NEEDY
No offense I mean shed probably

who was also the lead singer

CHIP
Like Phil Collins
NEEDY
Whos Phil Collins
CHIP
Forget it Hes seminal but
whatever
NEEDY

Anyway this singer guy is like
22 so he could get locked up in
the state pen if he actually dated
her But Jennifer says hes extra
salty so
CHIP
Salty You guys ever going to stop
using that secret language

NEEDY
Salty means beautiful
CHIP
Then you must be soy sauce babe
Needy and CHIP start MAKING OUT CHIP unbuckles his belt
eagerly even though theyve barely begun Needy stops

NEEDY
Jennifers here
CHIP
How do you know
Needy shrugs A beat of silence Then we hear the door
swing open JENNIFERS VOICE floats up from downstairs
JENNIFER
(OS)
Needy quit tampooning yourself
and get down here
CHIP
Thats fucking weird
NEEDY
(straightening her
CLOTHES )
Id better hurry
CHIP
You always do what Jennifer tells
you to do
Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and
flashes a heart-shaped BFF charm at Chip

NEEDY
Shes my best friend Chip
Remember This necklace is no
joke
CHIP sighs resigned They head downstairs

INT NEEDYS HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - SAME
Jennifer is waiting in the front hallway Shes heavily
made-up and dressed in a predictably sexy outfit She
dangles a set of car keys in front of Needy and CHIP
JENNIFER
(GLOATING)

Guess whos got the whip “til

1130 A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and

its all mine

NEEDY
Wow

JENNIFER
Youre lucky you get to ride with
me to the club in style
She does a sexy little dance in the doorway then notices
CHIP

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Oh hi Chip Do you like puppies
She grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him
giggling Needy watches jealously and MANEUVERS HER WAY
IN FRONT OF JENNIFER
CHIP
I think you forgot like two
buttons

NEEDY
I think she remembered two
buttons

Jennifer sniffs the air
JENNIFER
It smells like Thai food in here
(BEAT)
Have you guys been fucking
NEEDY
Youre gross

She shoves Jennifer and they begin wrestling playfully
CHIP slumps against the wall staring awestruck at
Jennifers cleavage
JENNIFER
Okay lets go to the club
The three of them shuffle onto the porch Needy locks the
door
CHIP
The Carousel is not a club
JENNIFER
Eat my ass Chip Youre just
jello ‘cause youre not invited
CHIP
Im not jello That place is
gross Everyone there has a
mustache

JENNIFER
Youre totally jello Youre lime
green jello and you cant even
admit it
The girls scamper toward the car

CHIP
(calling after them)
Stop kidnapping my girlfriend

INT THE CAROUSEL - NIGHT

THE CAROUSEL is a run-down tavern at the edge of town
the kind with NASCAR posters wobbly chairs and strands
of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling Its a
busy night and the bar is teeming with locals

A bartender sells a CASE OF BEER to a customer and passes
it over the bar

NEEDY VO

Chip was right The Carousel is

definitely not a club Clubs are

for attractive people in populous

urban areas Clubs have Dds and

champagne and separate bathrooms

for guys and girls All we have is

a broken jukebox a few domestic

taps and the Sticker Toilet

SMASH CUT TO

INT BATHROOM - SAME
We see a lone nasty-looking TOILET covered in BAND
STICKERS
BACK ON NEEDY
Needy and Jennifer enter the bar Every guy in the joint
stares at Jennifer who snaps her MINOR wristband
distastefully
JENNIFER

God I cant wait until Im old

enough to get wasted Have you

ever had peach schnapps

NEEDY
I dont think so

JENNIFER
Peach schnapps are excellent They
even taste good when they come out
of your nose mid-puke

A teenage guy CRAIG passes by and waves

CRAIG
Hi Jennifer You look nice
JENNIFER
(without enthusiasm)
What up Craig
She elbows Needy and makes a GAGGING GESTURE
JENNIFER (CONTD)
He thinks hes cute enough for me
No wonder hes in retard math
Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one
awkwardly Needy notices AHMET FROM INDIA a FOREIGN
EXCHANGE STUDENT standing by himself away from the
crowd
NEEDY
Hey its Ahmet from India The
foreign exchange guy Hes all by
himself

JENNIFER

I cant believe we traded a cute

hockey player for that

NEEDY

He seems okay Hes got that cool

elephant statue in his locker
JENNIFER

Do you think hes circumcised I

always wanted to try sea cucumber

NEEDY

Ew
ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer swigging a bottle of
beer He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her
ROMAN
Youre smoking dicks now Jen
JENNIFER
What I like the Wides

She sticks the fat cigarette between her lips and inhales
pointedly
ROMAN
I just bet you do I should arrest
you for possession under the legal
age
JENNIFER
Arrest me pfft Youre not even
out of the academy yet Roman
ROMAN
Two more months and Im on the
force for real Then Ill be able
to cuff you whenever the hell I
want
He grips her wrist and twists it behind her back
JENNIFER
How will I wait that long
She paws Romans crotch discreetly Needy winces
ROMAN
Not here babe I gotta keep my
nose clean
NEEDY
(POINTING)
Look theres the band

A group of skinny INDIE ROCK BOYS are setting up their
equipment on a pathetically tiny stage-- its more like a
dais The LEAD SINGER has intense spooky eyes nearly
obscured by a shock of hair The locals mostly good ol
boys eye the band suspiciously

JENNIFER
You can tell theyre from the
city

ROMAN

Yeah ‘cause they look like a
bunch of faygos
JENNIFER
You would think that Youre such
a small-time Gomer I wish we had
more guys like that in Devils
Kettle All stylish and shit
Needy nods dumbly She stares at the band awestruck

NEEDY
They look so-- so cool
She gazes at the stage hearing only the whistling rush
of ARCTIC AIR In SLOW MOTION the GUITARIST unsheathes
his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag He notices her
staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips
Needy swallows hard
JENNIFER
Hey I think they need two
groupies Come on Itll be like
Almost Famous Ill be Penny Lane

and you can be the other girl
She grabs Needys hand and enthusiastically tries to drag
her toward the stage

NEEDY
No

JENNIFER
Dont be JV Needy Theyre just
boys Morsels We have all the
power dont you know that
She plants her hands on Needys CHEST
JENNIFER (CONTD)
These things are like smart bombs
Point “em in the right direction
and shit gets real

Needy shrugs free of Jennifers grasp and follows her
reluctantly across the room

The lead singer of Soft Shoulder NIKOLAI WOLF is
already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the
stage His gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed-black
hair

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Hi Um we just really wanted to
meet you or something Im
Jennifer Check and this is my

friend

NIKOLAI
Im Nikolai Wolf and this is my
band

He reaches down and pumps Jennifers outstretched hand

JENNIFER
(AWKWARD )
Yeah Soft Shoulder right Ive
heard you guys are super super
good at playing your instruments
NIKOLAI
I hope we can live up to
suchhigh praise
NEEDY
Hey if you dont mind me asking
why did you want to play all the
way out here in Devils Kettle
You live in the city right
NIKOLATI
Yeah But I think its so
important to connect with our fans
in rural areas Plus the
audiences in small towns really
appreciate us
JENNIFER
Can I show you my appreciation
right now
Needy looks at the floor embarrassed

Jennifers voice scales up nervously
JENNIFER (CONTD)
Like Ill buy you a drink I
mean Ill see if I can get you a
drink They make this great 911
tribute shooter Its red white
and blue but you have to drink it
fast or it gets all brownish
NIKOLAI
(GRIMACING)

Mmm

Jennifer hurries off toward the bar

Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner not
wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone
A LOCAL plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox with
a challenging stare at the band A DRUNK COUPLE begins
two-stepping in front of the stage
Nikolai walks up to the guitar player DIRK and pulls
him aside Needy pricks up her ears and listens

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Dirk what about her
DIRK
(gesturing to Needy)
Who Training Bra Jones

Needy looks offended
NIKOLAI
No the hot one The one who just
walked away Shes it man Shes
exactly what were looking for
DIRK
Youre sure shes
NIKOLAI
Shes a kid Were in Gods
country man Everyone out heres
a fundie bible-banger Of course
shes a virgin

Dirk hesitates

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Dirk we didnt haul our asses out
to this corn palace for nothing

DIRK
Fine Okay You know I know Im
not just the bassist Ima
person who happens to play the
bass guitar And I would like some
respect

Nikolai is already ignoring him

Needy alarmed

emerges from her hiding place and

discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is

arguing with a jealous-looking Roman He shakes his head
in disgust and leaves the bar
Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC

THEMED DRIN
expression

JENNIFER

What Are you scared of rock stars
too

NEEDY

Those guys are rank Jen Just
forget about it

JENNIFER
I think the singer wants me
NEEDY
Only because he thinks youre a
virgin I heard them talking

JENNIFER
Yeah right Im not even a
backdoor-virgin anymore thanks to
Roman By the way that hurts I
couldnt even go to flags the next
day I had to stay home and sit on
a bag of frozen peas

NEEDY
Oh my God

JENNIFER

She laughs when she sees Needys concerned

Well if Nikolai wants innocent I
can do innocent Ill be Little
Miss Fucking Sunshine

NEEDY
Hes way too old for you

JENNIFER
Dont cock-block me Needy

Piercing FEEDBACK signals the beginning of the set
Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly
NIKOLAI
Good evening Devils Lake
Someone in the back shouts Devils Kettle
NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Sorry Anyway were Soft
Shoulder And we just want to make
you happy
He WINKS at Jennifer
The band launch into the same intense soaring song we
heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE Jennifers eyes never
leave Nikolais Shes hypnotized clinging to Needys
arm Even the locals look charmed
Suddenly a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
next to the stage Needy is the first to notice As she
watches in horror the fire is reflected in her glasses

The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to
blaze uncontrollably People SCREAM and scatter Someone
ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
fire

Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading He and Chas
exchange glances The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
aside and jumps off the stage and the drummer abandons
his kit Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
watches from the stageis he smiling

CHAOS Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once
causing a stampede A womans clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
and she falls to her knees We see a BEAM fall from the
roof nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA

Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state

NEEDY
(to Jennifer)
I know where to go
Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
tiny BATHROOM Choking on smoke they climb onto the
Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
BATHROOM WINDOW Hundreds are still trapped inside
screaming

EXT THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS

Jennifer collapses in Needys arms coughing Needy hugs
her fiercely almost romantically She cups Jennifers
flushed face and looks into her eyes

JENNIFER
(DAZED)
Its so hot Needy I think Im on
fire Oh God Im burning

NEEDY
Youre okay I promise You got
burned worse when you wore that
tin-foil bikini to the beach
Everythings fine
Suddenly a HAND clamps onto Jennifers shoulder Both
girls jump Its Nikolai his forehead creased with false
concern
NIKOLAI
Are you girls all right

Needy is less than thrilled to see him
NEEDY
Were great Maybe you should try
to find your band
NIKOLAI
Those guys They were the first
ones out the door Ran for the van
like a bunch of Marys Frankly
Im ashamed of them
Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously
Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building
Jennifer covers her ears and cowers sweat rolling down
her face

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
God it feels like hell out here
Come and hang with us in the van
for a while just until they hose
this place down

JENNIFER
Okayokay
She slumps against Nikolais chest

NIKOLAI
Youre in shock Here drink this
Youll feel better
He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
from his coat and holds it to Jennifers lips She swigs
it cooperatively dribbling down her chin

Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence

NEEDY

Arent you a little freaked out

about this What about all your

stuff Its probably melting and

when you get to the next stop

youll have to do like a crappy

acoustic set Nobody likes that
NIKOLAI

Well be able to afford new gear

soon enough I have a feeling

were gonna blow up

JENNIFER
(SLURRING)
I want to see your van Cmon
Needy lets go to the van
NEEDY
Why Why should we We have the
Malibu Lets just get out of
here We can go to El Ojo and get
Northwoods Nachos with extra
Badger Sauce Please Im
starving
JENNIFER
Needy stop it Just stop it
She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN which
is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar
Needy staggers after them slowly watching
Behind Needy the bar EXPLODES Screams Flames Silence
Needy doesnt even look back as she watches Jennifer get
into the van Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes

Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van
revealing his slick muscled white torso
NEEDY VO
watched her get into that van
and I knew something awful was
going to happen But for some
reason I felt drawn toward them
Toward him He was pale and
twisted and evil like this
petrified tree I saw when I was a
id

EXT PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK - (FLASHBACK)

We see LITTLE NEEDY about five years old staring up at
a petrified tree in the darkness horrified yet
compelled The tree seems to stoop forward cracking

BACK ON NEEDY

Needys face is fixed in the same haunted expression
Nikolai turns to look at her his teeth bared ina
vicious smile

Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction
away from the van and the fire

INT NEEDYS BEDROOM - 1100 PM

Needy stumbles into her bedroom overwhelmed Her clothes
are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty

She grabs her cheap taped-up cell phone and dials CHIPs
number shakily

CROSS CUT
PHONE CALL

INT CHIPS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Chips bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone
lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping
form clad only in jockey shorts
CHIP
(SLEEPILY)
Hey Niedermeyer

CHIP
Like burned down To the ground
Is everyone okay

NEEDY

No I think theyre mostly dead
CHIP

Shit Youre okay right
NEEDY

We went out the bathroom window
Everyone else was trying to use
the door It was like a stampede
The people who fainted got run
over and you could hear their
bones breaking

(MORE)

NEEDY (CONTD)
There was all this screaming and
popping like a million Black Cats
all going off at once And the
smell

CHIP
This is real right This isnt

NEEDY
No Anyway it took me like an
hour to walk home But Jennifers

one of those white molester vans

CHIP
(SLEEPILY)
Holla back
Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs As she
passes through the shadowy kitchen appliances HUM all
around her The silence is menacing

INT NEEDYS HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - CONTINUOUS
Needy opens the door Nobody there
She slams the door turns around and SCREAMS

Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway looking ghostly
pale and smiling Her clothes are tattered and stained--
her entire front is soaked in blood Her makeup is
smeared and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a
zombies She looks HORRIFYING especially with that
ghastly clownish grin

NEEDY
Um Jennifer
Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood-
tinged teeth
NEEDY (CONTD)
What happened
Utter silence Then a dripping sound Needy looks down
and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum
Jennifer continues to smile staring directly at Needy
NEEDY (CONTD)
(TREMBLING)
J-Jen

Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM wailing at
the top of her lungs She vomits a torrent of evil-
looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
staggers wildly down the hallway

The bloody black bile hits the wall splashing a framed
school portrait of Needy Needy screams and watches in
horror as it slides down the wall

The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it
like little porcupine needles and it appears to move by
itself oozing across the linoleum creeping into the
corners Its truly revolting

Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
mouth

Jennifer falls to her knees her screams turning to
jagged insane laughter

Needy tries to run but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
against the wall with superhuman force pinning her
Jennifer slowly tantalizingly brushes her face against
Needys hair her earlobe Needy doesnt move a muscle
Jennifers hand slides up Needys ribcage She presses
her lips against Needys carotid artery

We hear Needys blood pumping swishing

JENNIFER
(WHISPERING)
Are you scared
Needy nods
Jennifer parts her lips Then suddenly she stops and
PULLS AWAY pushing Needy to the floor Jennifer bolts
out the front door and takes off running down the street
Needy is motionless for a moment then stumbles toward
the doorway
NEEDY
(screaming after her)
Jennifer
But shes long gone

INT KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING

Moments before the first morning bell Needy is sitting
at her desk in English class still visibly bruised from
her scuffle with Jennifer the night before She looks
like she hasnt slept a wink

The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
fire and gather in groups

GOSSIPING GIRL
(WHISPERING)
I heard Needy and Jennifer were
there and they had to fight their
way out with a machete

OTHER GIRL
Look shes not even moving
GOSSIPING GIRL
Its called Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder
Suddenly a figure steps in front of Needy Its
JENNIFER looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably
unscathed She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing
happened the night before
JENNIFER
Happy Friday D-bag
NEEDY
You-- youre all right

( )

JENNIFER
Yeah Why wouldnt I be
NEEDY

Last night At my house You were
hurt You had two black eyes and
blood everywhere and

JENNIFER
Needy youre delusional I got a
little banged up when you made me
go out that window but Im fine
NEEDY
(DUMBFOUNDED)
We had to go out that window The
bar was like engulfed in flames
JENNIFER
You do have a tendency to
overreact Remember at Girl Scout
camp when you thought there was an
earthquake and it was really just
two guys with a ghetto blaster

NEEDY
A lot of people died Jennifer
They burned to death or they
choked or they just got trampled
More than half of the people there
didnt make it out Its like all
over the news National news Kids
are dead Parents are dead

JENNIFER
Anyone we know

NEEDY
We know everyone

JENNIFER
Sucks to be them I guess
She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse
NEEDY
I dont get it Whats wrong with
you
Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together

JENNIFER
Whats wrong with you I mean
besides the obvious surface flaws

Needy rubs her eyes stunned
NEEDY
(to herself)
Theres no way I dreamed it No
way

She looks down at her hands Theres DRIED BLOOD under
her fingernails
NEEDY VO
Her blood was still under my
nails See Id been up all night
scrubbing the carnage off the
linoleum

INT NEEDYS HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

We see Needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue
light of dawn sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and
bile off the floor with a dirty sponge The black spiny
vomit repulses her and she gags

She reaches for a Swiffer WetJet mop and pulls the
trigger No solution comes out She curses hysterical
and sleep-deprived

NEEDY
Work youtwat Swiff darn it
Swiff Swiff

She collapses in tears on the floor
BACK ON NEEDY- PRESENT DAY

NEEDY (CONTD)
(softly to herself)
Shoot
JENNIFER
Dont talk to yourself Its one
of your more freakish Needy
behaviors and it makes us both

look like total gaylords
Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer spreading
her fingers to display her filthy fingernails

JENNIFER (CONTD)

Eww you need a mani bad Youd

better find a Chinese chick to

buff your situation

MR WROBLEWSKI a middle-aged teacher enters the room
He has a gnarly-looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly
JENNIFER (CONTD)
(SMIRKING)
Here comes Handi-Snack

Mr Wroblewski clears his throat His voice quavers
MR WROBLEWSKI
Im sure those of you who made it
here today have all heard the
news Its a dark day for Devils
Kettle a day we can never ever
forget
A single stifled sob rises from the class Needy glances
around the room and sees students fighting back tears A
huge JOCK weeps openly tears spattering his swimsuit-
model decorated notebook Jennifer smirks barely able to
contain her laughter
MR WROBLEWSKI (CONTD)
The administration here has
decided that today will be a
unstructured day of support and
remembrance Weve lost nine
precious students-- including
Ahmet from India-- several
parents and a teacher Ms
Parrish
He fights back tears
JENNIFER
No way Parrish ate shit

Needy shushes her appalled
MR WROBLEWSKI
This tragedy is obviously beyond
anything we can measure More than
ever we need to band together and
draw strength from each other
Mr Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his
pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face
MR WROBLEWSKI (CONTD)
(his voice cracking)
We can rise up We can overcome
death

Needy eyes Jennifer warily

The jock collapses in sobs A tiny acne-scarred GEEK
leans over and folds the jock into an unlikely hug
JENNIFER
(DRY)
Oh look theyre united in grief
Thatll last

INT KETTLE HIGH HALLWAY - AFTER SCHOOL
The automated bell rings Needy slings on her backpack
and hurries over to CHIPs locker Hes packing up a pair
of drum mallets
CHIP
No band practice today
NEEDY
No anything today

Its surreal right I mean when
just one guy dies in Devils
Kettle its like time stops And

start again

NEEDY

I feel guilty just breathing
CHIP

NEEDY

door That was Jennifer But she
didnt talk She just stood there
smiling at me but a bad kind of
smile She looked like shed been

beat up or shot or something She
was all bloody
(MORE )

NEEDY (CONTD)
And then she barfed up this
disgusting prickly stuff that was
like roadkill and sewing needles
all mixed together

She shudders at the memory

CHIP
Yuck Like those porcupine
meatballs my mom makes with the
rice sticking out

NEEDY
Yeah like almost that bad

CHIP and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence

CHIP
It was probably because she
inhaled a whole bunch of smoke

NEEDY
No It was something evil

CHIP
You might want to talk to the
school shrink Needy Im not
saying that to be a dillhole Im
actually kinda concerned
NEEDY

Chip Im a National Merit

NEEDY
Discombobulated
CHIP

As they prepare to leave COLIN GRAY approaches Needy

suspiciously

EXT KETTLE HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS
JONAS KOZELLE the JOCK we saw sobbing earlier is

standing at the deserted football field

Its a gray overcast fall day and the wind whistles
eerily through the trees The football is set back a good
a distance from the school and Jonas is all alone
In the distance a tiny figure slowly approaches It
starts a dot on the horizon As it draws closer we see
its JENNIFER Her bright lipsticked grin is eerie and
unmistakable
Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder
indifferent
A few seconds later he glances again Strangely
Jennifer ISNT THERE
Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonass left side startling
him

JENNIFER
Hi
JONAS
(ALARMED )
Oh Hey Jennifer
JENNIFER

Im crazy-sorry about your
profound loss You are crying
about Craig right

JONAS

He was my best friend
Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically

JENNIFER
I know I was close to him too
You know I was there last night
in that horrible place I saw
Craig a few minutes before the
fire broke out

JONAS

You-- you did

JENNIFER
Yeah I was probably the last
person to talk to him Like ever
Literally

JONAS
Wow What did he say

JENNIFER
Well we got to talking about you

said He said you were like a
brother to him Not a bro An
actual brother

Jonass lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back
tears Jennifer cuddles closer to him

JONAS
(choking up)
I just cant believe hes gone
JENNIFER

(BEAT)
Hey you know what else Craig

JONAS

JONAS
He said bangin
Jennifer reaches for Jonass hand and slides it slowly up
her shirt placing it on her left breast

JENNIFER
(WHISPERING)
Feel my heart Jonas I think its
broken
JONAS
(choking up)
Mine too

JENNIFER

Come with me Just for a while

Well help each other get through

this nightmare Its what Craig

would have wanted
Jonas nods dumbly brainwashed Jennifer leads him away
from the field toward the WOODS bordering the school
campus They vanish into the woods In the distance we
see the FALLS rushing into the lake

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

Needy and Chip are walking home from school still deep

in discussion

CHIP

The whole night must be a total

blur right

NEEDY

Thats the thing its not a blur

Especially what happened after
CHIP

After is the part I dont really

get to be honest

NEEDY

INT WOODS SURROUNDING SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Jennifer and Jonas are in the woods Jennifer efficiently
whips off her top and bra and begins kissing Jonas
hungrily As Jonas touches her he recoils
JONAS
You feel so warm Why are you so

warm
JENNIFER
(firmly covering his
MOUTH)
Shutties

She pulls off Jonas shirt and digs her nails into his
arms kissing him with renewed ferocity

The woods are dead silent A few squirrels approach the
clearing and Jonas watches them warily with one open eye
as Jennifer kisses him Then a deer wanders into the
clearing Then a fox The animals pause in their tracks
and watch motionless Its an eerie unnatural tableau

Animals continue to gather
JONAS
(MUFFLED )
Jennifer Jen

Jennifer is annoyed
JENNIFER

What

JONAS
Look
He gestures to the ANIMALS who are watching still as
statues A few crows alight on a nearby tree
JENNIFER
Mm-hmm Theyre waiting
JONAS
Uh okay
Jennifer unzips Jonass jeans and smiles reaching down
and working him with her hand Jonas moans still eyeing
the animals

JENNIFER
Do you miss Craig
( )

JONAS
(STARTLED)
Of course
JENNIFER

Dont worry Youre going to see
your buddy again

JONAS
You mean like in heaven someday
JENNIFER
No
She smiles and shakes her head
Jonas jerks back creeped out He tries to pull away from
Jennifer but shes too strong She PINS him to the tree
We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE like some horrible
snake Her eyes cloud over with blood

EXT KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

A horrible SCREAM of agony rises from the woods Mr
Wroblewski is exiting the school briefcase in hand He
stops in his tracks when he hears the scream He shakes
his head sadly
MR WROBLEWSKI
(to himself)
God theyre feeling so much pain
Another scream this time weaker

MR WROBLEWSKI (CONTD)
Let it all out kids
He heads for his Ford Festiva then pauses as if thinking
better of it Something isnt right He puts his keys
back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to
investigate

INT NEEDYS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in
the kitchen Needys ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across
the cracked floor

Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a
bite

NEEDY
Fried bologna is the bomb
(to ferret)
You want some Greedo
She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a
very familiar song Through the Trees by Soft
Shoulder
Suddenly she pauses a look of UNEASE and even FEAR
crossing her face She stops and braces herself against
the counter her KNEES SHAKING Something isnt right
She drops the sandwich Greedo goes straight for it
NEEDY (CONTD)
Somethings wrong
As Needy sinks to her knees she stares straight ahead at
the REFRIGERATOR A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back
at her

She closes her eyes A brief near-subliminal FLASH of
the carnage in the woods

The song ends snapping Needy out of her reverie
RADIO DJ

That was Soft Shoulder the local
band who became the unlikely
heroes of the tragedy in Devils
Kettle last night Eyewitnesses
say the boys helped numerous
people escape the inferno risking
their own lives in the process
Thats rock n roll with a
conscience ladies and gentlemen
Had a lot of requests for that
one

EXT KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - SAME

Mr Wroblewski ventures into the woods heading toward
the clearing At first we can only hear mysterious
sounds-- scratching and smacking Birds and animals are
closely gathered in a circle

Suddenly Mr Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags
realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS
A BADGER looks up its snout soaked in blood

Mr Wroblewski begins to scream The animals scatter

A glimpse of the CORPSE Its Jonas of course His
entire torso has been torn open exposing his ribs and
guts Blood and viscera everywhere INTESTINES strewn
about the forest floor like party streamers
MR WROBLEWSKI

Mr Wroblewski falls to his knees hollering

EXT KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING
A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight
The sun has begun to set An ambulance and four police
cars have pulled up near the woods which are cordoned
off with yellow police tape Near the woods JONASS
PARENTS are crying His MOTHER screams and begins beating
the ground with her fists
A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance

EXT ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS
The sound of Jonass parents screaming carries across the
lake The water is eerily calm

Suddenly a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake Its
Jennifer gliding through the water She looks calm and
serene

The SCREAMING continues across the lake The sirens
shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful
scene

Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the
pier naked and dripping wet She runs her tongue over
her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out
from between her two front teeth like shes just
finished a delicious rib dinner

Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her
clothes which are neatly folded on the pier

Once shes dressed she walks off into the woods as if
nothing out of the ordinary has happened

hard with the pin without flinching Blood spurts from
the wound

A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a
dreamy montage of headlines
The headline of the Devils Kettle Sun-Post simply reads

WHY

DISSOLVE TO

The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads

BUTCHERED

wake of devastating fire

Devils Kettle youth brutally murdered in

A smaller headline on the front page of the New York

Times reads

NEEDY VO
We were famous We were saints
Our towns only bar had burned to
the ground and our star
quarterback was somebodys Quarter
Pounder The whole country got a
huge tragedy boner for Devils
Kettle And the press-- God they
couldnt get enough of our little
world of shit

Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder

We see Devils Kettle citizens holding a tearful

candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site

They
softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song
MOURNERS
(SINGING)
Through the trees I will find
you

We see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats
of Jonas abandoned locker The hallway floor is covered
with teddy bears and bouquets

We see the PASSING OF TIME as the bouquets wilt and the
blooms droop

The pile of discarded scratch-off tickets next to Needys
mothers bed grows steadily as the days go by
Another Star Tribune headline This one reads Two weeks
later cannibal killer still at large A smaller subhead
reads ARTS Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major
NEEDY VO
The days marched on as usual but
most of us were too numb to enjoy
ourselves Most of us
We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school
hallway in a sleazy Technicolor outfit The rest of the
kids look grey ashen and depressed but Jennifer pops
like a Roman candle
NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Still we were healing Like CHIP
we figured things could only get
better We had faith

We see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the
school courtyard They smile then laugh as if theyre
re-learning how to be happy

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
We were fucking idiots

EXT CAMERFORD STREET - NIGHT

Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a
classic car Hes blasting punk music on an iPod thats
been rigged to the ancient AM radio

Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions
Jennifer texted him

The street is extremely dark and silent occupied only by
a new townhouse development The identical units still
appear to be under construction There arent even any
streetlights The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps
eerily in the breeze

Colins brow furrows in confusion-- it doesnt even look
like anyone lives here yet He checks the phone display
again

CLOSE ON PHONE

The TEXT MESSAGE reads

1004 camerford C-ya xoxo jen

Sure enough the house number is 1004 Colin throws the
car into park and walks up to the porch He looks up and
notices a glow coming from an upstairs window

Colin presses the doorbell Nothing happens-- the house
isnt wired for electricity yet

He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4 There are piles of
sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is
definitely still under construction Colin looks
confused
A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers
COLIN (CONTD)

The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response

Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the
creaking stairs

INT CHIPS BEDROOM - SAME
Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly
plain white bra complete with center bow CHIP also
shirtless cops a feel

orange CONDOM Needy looks at the wrapper

INT 1004 CAMERFORD - CONTINUOUS

Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom The dark
room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling
into bizarre shapes A single BLANKET is spread out on
the floor Colin shivers
Behind him in the doorway Jennifer appears her smiling
face hellishly aglow

JENNIFER

You made it

COLIN
Whats going on This isnt really

confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes

the condom Needy leans forward for a closer look
NEEDY
Oh Its got little bumps on it I

INT 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
Jennifer grips Colins face in her hands and forcibly
kisses him on the mouth Colin succumbs but stiffly
We hear a SCRATCHING noise Colin pulls away
instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the
walls skittering over surfaces

COLIN

Jennifer

Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles
JENNIFER
You scared I thought boys like
you were into vermin

She unbuttons his jeans They fall noisily to the floor--
theyre the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles
galore

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Nice hardware Ace

Colin into Jennifers eyes Theres something horrible
about her facelike shes become almost corpselike
COLIN

(FAINTLY)
No way
JENNIFER
Oh dont you dare pass out I
need you to be conscious
COLIN

JENNIFER
I need you frightened
Colin tries to jerk away but Jennifer easily disengages
his arm from its socket A sickeningly moist SNAP Colin
cries out in pain

JENNIFER (CONTD)
I need you hopeless
She slams him to the ground and mounts him Her jaw
unhinges opening her mouth to a horrifying inhuman
degree Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely
crowded like they belong to some horribly deformed dog
She descends on him feeding ravenously

We see their shadows against the wall Jennifer lunging
hungrily blood spraying up from Colins jugular We can
hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood

INT CHIPS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CHIP is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy his eyes
closed in concentration Needys vacant eyes are suddenly
brimming with tears

Hopelesshopeless
CHIP opens his eyes

CHIP
What Am I hurting you
Needy starts weeping
CHIP (CONTD)
Am I too big
Tears roll down Needys cheeks She begins moaning then
SCREAMING at that top of her lungs

She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls blood

and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows Then the

infamous spiny black bile

Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness Skulls

jesters demons death Its the worst acid trip

imaginable

Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream
( )

CHIP immediately rolls off Needy concerned He grabs her
and tries to shake some sense into her
CHIP (CONTD)
Needy Whats wrong
Needy continues to shriek hysterically her voice growing
ragged

INT 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME

We can still hear Colin making inhuman sounds of pain We
can only see the carnage in shadow but its clearly
unspeakable

Needy clutches her throat hyperventilating She stands
up and struggles to get dressed Her breath rasps Chip
is freaking out
CHIP

CHIP
Do you need more foreplay

INT 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME

Colins thrashing limbs finally go limp Jennifer is
hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood
into her mouth with cupped hands

We see his eyes flecked with blood pupils dilated A
white MOUSE crawls over his face

INT CHIPS HOUSE - SAME
Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit
CHIP

She bolts out the room leaving Chip naked and alone He
pulls his knees up to his chest vulnerable

EXT CHIPS STREET - SAME

Needy runs toward her moms CAR a beat-up Kia parked on
the curb

She climbs into the car and starts the ignition
trembling and crying

She pulls out onto the street and guns it She swings a
hard left The streets are all almost identical lined by
working-class homes
She turns on the radio The song is of course Through
the Trees by Soft Shoulder She pounds the dashboard
hysterical
NEEDY
Fudge Fudge Maple fudge

Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark
tree-lined street Then she sees something bright emerge
from the shadows Her eyes widen

Its JENNIFER creeping toward the curb like an animal
Shes pale in the moonlight The entire lower half of her
face is covered in blood like a ghoulish beard of gore
She flashes a huge deranged toothy SMILE at Needy

Needy screams and SWERVES The car fishtails out of
control and slides into a ditch

Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator trying to get
out of the trench She glances desperately out the side
window Jennifer is gone
Panting Needy tries to accelerate again

Suddenly Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS
her body against the windshield her long limbs splayed
like an insects The windshield SHATTERS Jennifer grins
at Needy through the cracking glass
Needy screams again puts the pedal to the floor and
manages to rear up out of the ditch Jennifers body
tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the
street

she creeps over to the window and looks out Nothing
there but the wind Jennifers gone

EXT OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY

Were in a small Catholic cemetery A small neat gravel
path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
valley where a funeral is taking place

Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard Then a
procession of 6 or 7 GOTHEMO KIDS appears on the crest
of the hill They move forward into the cemetery
flamboyantly dressed in black capes chains cloaks neon
hairpieces fishnets mesh 18-hole combat boots etc
These are Colin Grays friends

One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on
the path as she stumbles along weeping
At the bottom of the hill Colin Grays very conservative-
looking family stands next to the fresh grave surrounded
by sympathetic mourners NEEDY stands near the back
looking shell-shocked There are also a few press
photographers snapping photos and of course a Catholic
priest
PRIEST
We gather here today to celebrate
the life of Colin Gray who was
plucked from the prime of
The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the
motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral The
priest clears his throat disapprovingly
PRIEST (CONTD)
What is this disturbance

MR GRAY
These are Colins friends
A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly
GOTH BOY
Colin Take me with you I belong
down there In the DAAAARKNESS
GOTH GIRL
No Kevin Those are just his
fleshly remains Hes among the
dark angels of the realm now Fly
Colin Fly into the firmament
She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air
Colins father gags appalled
GOTH BOY
Is it cool if we camp here for a
few days We want to commune with
his corpse He was our spooky
homeboy

PRIEST
Children this is a private
service for family only
GOTH GIRL
(to Colins mother)
Oh right I need to ask you
something Mrs Gray Its really
important for me to have closure
PRIEST
Young lady have some respect for
this family
MRS GRAY
(waving him off)
No Its fine

GOTH GIRL
Is it true that Colin had a date
with Jennifer Check the night he
was killed

She says Jennifer Check as if it were the most
disgusting name imaginable Needy covers her face
GOTH GIRL (CONTD)
Because Jennifer Check is a social
disease Shes not like us She
thinks shes so special just
because shes popular and and is
what society considers
attractive But shes not
sincere Shes about as emo as a
breast implant And she listens to
Jessica Simpson and shops at
Hollister And I just know Colin
would never go out with someone
like that and I just need
confirmation From you So did he
MR GRAY
Did he
GOTH GIRL
Have a date with Jennifer Check
Colins parents stare at the ground

GOTH GIRL (CONTD)
Oh God Oh God I knew it That
BITCH I will erase her Ill put
a freaky Druid spell on her
(MORE )

GOTH GIRL (CONTD)
Ill spell her preppy ass right
into the ground
The parents flinch
GOTH BOY
Um Chloe Maybe you should be mad
at the person who murdered Colin
All Jennifer Check did was invite
him over to watch Aquamarine
GOTH GIRL
Thats WORSE
She throws herself to the ground crying and pounding the
dirt like a toddler
Colin Grays mother buries her head in her hands and
begins weeping Mr Gray attempts to comfort her

GOTH BOY
Colin wouldnt have liked this

MRS GRAY

(losing it)
Oh you think so Powder Yeah
youre right Im pretty sure my
son wouldnt have liked being
eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and
buried before his eighteenth
birthday Wow you must have known
him so well
MR GRAY

Jill
The goth boy looks terrified But Mrs Grays not done
ranting yet
MRS GRAY
By the time they found Colin in
that godforsaken house he looked
like lasagna with teeth Id know--
I had to identify the remains My
boys not in the realm of the
undead Hes not flying around in
the firmament with magical wings
of flame Hes in an overpriced
rosewood box thats headed six
feet downtown
She kicks the coffin to illustrate

MRS GRAY (CONTD)
So you can take your pain and
shove it up your asses kids
I got the monopoly on pain
The kids stare at her in awe Needy watches as Mrs Gray
collapses into Mr Grays arms

EXT KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - DAY
Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence
surrounding the football field It says TURNABOUT DANCE
OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE
Needy walks briskly toward school huddled in her parka
She looks totally fucked up like she hasnt slept in
days There are hollows beneath her eyes
NEEDY VO

They did a big memorial assembly

for Colin at school and we had to

watch another presentation about

curfews and the buddy system and

how to deal with grief But nobody

seemed to care anymore Sorrow was

last weeks emotion

We see Jennifer a few yards away talking and laughing
with some other flag team members

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Jennifer and I hadnt spoken since
our encounter in my room
Actually I hadnt really spoken
to anyone I was busy with

research Paranormal research
Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes As
she stares at Jennifer she see has a series of brief
gruesome HALLUCINATIONS
Jennifer as a grinning death mask Jennifer as a corpse
the lower half of her face rotted away Jennifer as a
harlequin monster Needy hears the rush of her own blood
the barely audible buzzing of flies
Chip jogs up next to her jolting her out of her reverie

CHIP
Hey Did you buy Turnabout tickets
yet I dont get paid until next

week

NEEDY
I gotta show you something
CHIP
What is it
NEEDY
Not here Behind the school
CHIP
What is it
NEEDY
Evidence
CHIP
(WEARILY)

Is this about Jennifer

NEEDY
Yes but I promise you this is the
last thing I need to show y--
CHIP
(INTERRUPTING)
Needy I care about you A lot As
a person not just a girl I made
love to for four minutes the other
night And Im scared of whats
happening to you Youre acting
really fucked up
NEEDY
Please just let me show you
Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option
but to submit He nods reluctantly

EXT KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS
Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school
Melting snow drips off the eaves

Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it

Its

full of copies from the library and Internet printouts

The spine

She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIPs hands

reads JENNIFER RESEARCH

NEEDY
Look at this

CHIP
(CONFUSED)

Demondemonic

NEEDY
Demonic transference Its
something that happens when you
try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan
without using an actual virgin

CHIP stares at her

She grabs

CHIP looks

NEEDY (CONTD)

I think thats what happened to
Jennifer Those guys from that
band were trying to sacrifice her
in the woods But what they didnt
realize is that she hasnt been a
virgin since junior high
Jennifers a total cum-dumpster
It all makes sense now Read
this
the piece of paper from him

NEEDY (CONTD)
(READING)
If the human sacrifice is impure

the result may still be attained
but a demon will forever reside
the soul of the victim She must
forever feed on flesh to sustain
the demon See
more dubious than ever

CHIP
Uh-huh

NEEDY

Shes eating boys They make her
strong Really strong And when
shes hungry she gets weak and

cranky and her hair is all full of
split ends And look at this
She holds up one of the printouts
NEEDY (CONTD)
It says that before the demon
feeds it vomits a gruesome
substance on its prey Like I saw

CHIP
You--you really think Jennifer
killed Jonas and Colin

NEEDY
And possibly Ahmet from India

Needy is silent for a moment She realizes CHIP will
never believe her and that shell lose him forever if she

continues babbling

CHIP
Really You think she ate those
guys

NEEDY

No No Of course not

CHIP
Is that what you think

NEEDY
NoListen Ill make an
appointment with Mr Feely Im
real sorry about this sudden onset
of teenage paranoia

(ROBOTIC)

My hormones and emotions are
aswirl and my moods are
erratic

CHIP isnt totally convinced but his face softens

CHIP

NEEDY
This has been a crummy school
year Chip

CHIP

Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster
NEEDY

CHIP
I was thinking a suit with black
shoes and a boutonniere right

He taps his chest Needy laughs
NEEDY VO

infectious crazy Only I wasnt

There are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly
shades of green and purple

A DJ plays badly-mixed pop music

Couples drift into the gym The GOTH KIDS who were at
Colin Grays grave travel in a pack sulking

The goth girl who loved Colin wanders through the

As she pops them she narrates dramatically

it again smirking

against the wall waiting anxiously for her Prince

Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside The fenced-in
deck area is littered with garbage abandoned pool
furniture and graffiti Someone has spray painted the
word HOPELESS on a wall

CHIP shivers and looks around nervously

Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out
of it revealing her bra and panties

CHIP
Arent you cold
JENNIFER
Never Trevor Im hot like magma
She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to
climb down the ladder on the side The pool is full of
filthy freezing water

JENNIFER

Come on in Chip Show me your
breast stroke
CHIP
The water looks disgusting
JENNIFER

both lost a close friend
CHIP nods sadly

CHIP

Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees
He leans in and kisses Jennifer whos still clinging to

The sound of buzzing flies grows louder
Suddenly Jennifer opens her eyes She hooks her arm
around Chips neck and lunges backward They tumble off
the ladder into the pool Chip SCREAMS

A terrified SCREAM in the distance
Needy whips around hikes up her skirt and starts running
toward Murphy Pool
She reaches the fence and starts climbing it She slips
and cuts her hand on a broken link
CHIP screams again on the other side of the fence

NEEDY (CONTD)
Im coming
She flings herself over the top of the fence her body
slamming against the concrete pool deck Her ARM snaps
Its a compound fracture the bone thrusting through the
flesh of her arm as she screams

INT MURPHY POOL - CONTINUOUS

Needy staggers toward the pool which is surrounded by an
extraterrestrial glow Chips moaning is almost
unbearable Needy stares into the abyss and claps her
hands over her mouth

Jennifer is waist deep in the DIRTY WATER flinging Chip
against the wall like a rag doll Hes still conscious
but his skin on his chest has been RIPPED OFF to expose
his ribs Jennifer is CHEWING happily

Chip looks at Needy his face a mask of agony

CHIP
(MOUTHING)
Needy
NEEDY
Holy crap

Jennifer begins gnawing on Chips neck so engaged in the
task that she doesnt notice Needy
Needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself

NEEDY (CONTD)

Saint Jude patron saint of

hopeless causes Please give me

the power to crush this bitch
Jennifer looks up with demonic bloodshot eyes just as
Needy leaps off the diving board
Needy lands on Jennifers shoulders taking her out She
wraps her legs around Jennifers neck and drags her under
the water
Jennifer emerges Needy grabs her by the hair and girly-
slaps her furiously across the face Then she spots the
PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool She grabs it
and sprays it in Jennifers eyes Jennifer shrieks and
vomits NASTY SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip

JENNIFER
Fuck this JV shit
Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess
hovering ten feet above the pool Her eyes burn Her skin
is corpselike Shes drenched from head to toe in the
prickly ooze

CHIP
(CROAKING)
She can fly
NEEDY

Shes just hovering CHIP Its
not that impressive
Jennifer speaks in a metallic demonic-sounding voice

JENNIFER
God do you have to undermine

player-hater

Needy glares at Jennifer surprisingly fearless
NEEDY
Youre a jerk
JENNIFER
Nice insult Lizzie McGuire Got
any more harsh digs

NEEDY

toys and pour lemonade on my bed

Why do you need him Huh
She begins to weep

NEEDY (CONTD)
(SOBBING)
Why do you need the one guy whos

(MORE )

NEEDY (CONTD)
The cutest guy in school The
mailman A teacher You could
probably even have a huge star
like Chad Michael Murray So why
Chip Why him Is it just to piss
me off Or is it because youre
insecure

Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts
down landing on her feet Needy crawls out of the pool
and faces her down
JENNIFER
I am not insecure God what a
joke How could I be insecure I
was the Snowflake Queen
NEEDY
Yeah two years ago When you were
socially relevant
JENNIFER
I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT

NEEDY
You were skinny then too
A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifers face She reels
back against the chain link fence her eyes blazing
JENNIFER
Im gonna eat your soul and shit
it out Lesnicki
Her voice is now an unearthly growl In the background
Chip is slowly painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an
eight-foot handle off the pool deck

NEEDY
(TREMBLING)
I thought you only murdered boys
JENNIFER
I go both ways
She HURTLES herself toward Needy roaring her eyes white-
hot her jaws agape Shes monstrous
Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the
HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear
As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed she IMPALES
HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle
Needy screams Theres a beat of deafening silence

Chip collapses on the pool deck
Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet shishkebabbed
on the giant skimmer With effort she pulls the handle
out of her body in several stages
JENNIFER (CONTD)

Ow-Ow-Ow
Needy watches and realizes Jennifer is injured Blood
drips onto the pool deck

NEEDY
(SURPRISED)
We hurt you

Blood trickles out of Jennifers wound She tries to plug
the hole with her hand

JENNIFER
Got a tampon
Needy shakes her head mutely
JENNIFER (CONTD)
Thought Id ask You seemed like
you might be pluggin

She begins to climb the fence wincing in pain then
glances over her shoulder at Needy and Chip
NEEDY
Where are you going
JENNIFER
Fuck this noise Im out You
losers are more trouble then
youre worth
She continues climbing
NEEDY
(EMOTIONAL)
Why give up now Hes almost dead
Get your bulimic ass back here and
kill us both
JENNIFER
Nah I mean you say Ive been a
bad friend all these years I
might as well throw you a bone

She smirks and jumps over the fence stumbling off into
the distance Needy watches her her eyes narrowing with
hate

Once Jennifer has disappeared Needy turns her attention
to Chip who is barely alive She stares in horror at his
torn arm and exposed ribs then falls to her knees over
his body

NEEDY
Oh Chip

CHIP
Needy You saved me

NEEDY

Im gonna call for help

She reaches into Chips pocket and pulls out his beat-up
cell phone She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand

CHIP
Oh no Im out of minutes

NEEDY

I think 911 is always a free call
CHIP
Oh yeah Youre right

Needy dials to no avail The phone is hopelessly clogged
with ooze She knocks it against the deck
NEEDY
Its not working Its full of
Jennifer-goo

Chip begins gagging and coughing He rolls onto his back
his eyelids fluttering

CHIP
(FAINTLY)
Hey Im going somewhere
NEEDY
No Youre not going anywhere
CHIP

Im toast Needy Im definitely

gonna die I think I already died
before you were here but I woke

up when I heard your voice

NEEDY
I love you

CHIP
Yeah me too And you look hot in
that dress

NEEDY
Youre clearly delirious

CHIP

No When youre dying you can see
everything a lot clearer You can
see whats true and whats not
The things that are true have this
glowing halo of light around them
like a picture of the Baby Jesus
or Barbara Walters when they use
the special lens And I know for
sure that youre totally hot

Needy begins to sob hoarsely
CHIP (CONTD)
Youd better get out of here The
police are going to come and I
dont want them to you know make
a mistake

NEEDY
Im never leaving

CHIP
But I have to go

NEEDY

No
Chips eyes close His face relaxes Hes gone
Needy wails at the top of her lungs She rests her head
against his mutilated chest oblivious to the blood and
bone

INT DEVILS KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
The dance is in full swing and students are slow-dancing
Girls rest their heads against boys chests only under
far less macabre circumstances than Needy and CHIPs
deathbed tableau
Soft Shoulder are still playing onstage their guitars
chiming melodically

The bass player Dirk turns toward Nikolai Wolf
DIRK
This sucks old-man balls
NIKOLAI
Shut up Its good PR

He accidentally speaks into the mic attracting unwanted
stares from the kids
NIKOLAI (CONTD)
(to audience)
I said its so good to be here
The students cheer approvingly their faces bright and
hopeful

Nikolai bares his teeth in a frighteningly fake smile

EXT CORVALLIS HIGH CAMPUS- CONTINUOUS

Illuminated by lamp light Needy limps toward the gym
entrance Shes completely covered in demon-goo Her face
is bloody her hair is full of blood and guts and her
BROKEN ARM looks gruesome

In the background yet another oblivious COUPLE are
making out

Needy stops to stare at them her gaze calm but obviously
insane They break apart and stare back at her
GIRL
What are you looking at Clumpy
NEEDY
(QUIETLY)
Just watching your old man try to
suck the ugly off your face
GUY
What did you say

Needy bends over casually holds one nostril closed and
does a farmer blow A bloody clot flies out of her
nose
The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks startled
GUY (CONTD)

Are you supposed to be Goth or

something

NEEDY
Did you know the original Goths
were a Germanic tribe that settled
in Rome They didnt wear black
They wore regular linen tunics I
dont know why nobody else knows
that
The couple have already resumed making out
Needy rolls her eyes turns away and continues limping
into the gym

INT GYM - CONTINUOUS

Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her
People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage
Theyre too busy slow dancing and laughing in their
respective cliques

She looks up at the stage where Soft Shoulder are
playing an insufferably long coda

Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo then looks up and
sees Needy looking directly at him her eyes full of

hate
Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk

Needy points to her eyes with two fingers then points at
Nikolai as if to say Gotcha She looks completely
possessed

NIKOLAI
(to Dirk)
We gotta get out of here
DIRK
Why
NIKOLAI

I think this girls flipping out

DIRK
What could she do to us

NIKOLAI
Look at her
Dirk takes one look at Needys face and takes off his
guitar Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave
the stage The music stops abruptly The kids in the gym
murmur and complain confused

Needy tries to follow them She limps blindly toward the
stage and climbs up Everyone watches gasping in horror
By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the
gym
NEEDY
(into the mic)
You didnt play your hit yet

But theyre gone
Needy looks out at her classmates They stare back She
PASSES OUT COLD

INT CHIPS STREET - MORNING (TO ESTABLISH)
NEEDY VO

They found Chip the following
morning The police couldnt find
an explanation for the substance
in the pool so they chose not to
mention it to the press In fact
they treated the whole incident
like a bad dream

INT CHIPS HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MORNING
We see the POLICE (including newly minted officer ROMAN
DUDA) informing Chips mother that his body has been
found She collapses onto the floor curling up into the
fetal position
NEEDY
Trouble was some of us would
never wake up

INT NEEDYS BEDROOM - DAY
Needy is lying in bed shaking her arm in a cast Her
mother tries to rouse her
NEEDY VO

I never went back to school after

that Didnt talk much either My

mom bought some books so she could

teach me at home like crazy

Christians with 14 kids do But I

wasnt a very cooperative student

Needy pulls the covers over her head

Toni shrugs resigned and tosses the book on the floor

EXT JENNIFERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Needy is crouched outside Jennifers window hiding in
the shrubbery She looks almost feral with wide eyes and
a hungry expression

Through the window we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
and combing her hair oblivious to the intruder in her
yard

NEEDY VO
What nobody realized was that I

was doing a different kind of

homework I was watching her every

night Waiting
We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
hair with a appraising eye

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
Waiting for her to get weak and
dull Waiting for her to burn
through the life-force shed
stolen from Chip

Needy creeps away from the window
NEEDY VO (CONTD)
It took weeks but I finally made
my move Remember

EXT JENNIFERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Were seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
Jennifer
Needy plunging through the window Jennifer thrashing
The blood The struggle The levitation The arrival of
the police
NEEDY VO

Even in her last moments of life

she somehow managed to be cooler

than me

We see for a moment Jennifers sly challenging smile
as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her That
signature look of mastery and control

NEEDY
She left an insanely hot corpse

We see Jennifers mother holding her again screaming
though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC Sure enough
Jennifers bleeding body seems to be artfully sensually
draped in her mothers arms She almost seems to be
SMIRKING at us

INT THE HOLE - NIGHT
Were back in solitary confinement where Needy has been
narrating the whole sordid tale She hasnt moved a
muscle since beginning her story Only a single shaft of
moonlight illuminates the room

An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door Its
a pile of mystery meat Needy wrinkes her nose

NEEDY VO
I dont even know who Needy
Lesnicki is anymore Ima
different person now A person who
uses curse words and kicks
orderlies and and sees things that
arent there A very bad very
damaged person

Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline
of her shirt

NEEDY VO (CONTD)
But sometimes change can be good
For instance most occult scholars
dont know this but if youre
bitten by a demon--and you live--
you just might absorb some of the
demons abilities
In the moonlight we see Needy still has a infected-
looking BITEMARK near her shoulder She scratches it
wincing
NEEDY VO (CONTD)
You just might get lucky for once
in your miserable life

PULL BACK to reveal that Needy still cross-legged is

HOVERING five feet off the floor Effortlessly

With visible concentration she slowly flies up toward a

narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling To anyone

with normal abilities it would be impossible to access

Needy reaches the window gazes at it for a moment then
SMASHES it with surprising strength

EXT LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers
She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
passes through it after casually mangling the bars Only
a Needy-shaped hole remains
EXT COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER

Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road
The hospital recedes in the background

A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road watching
Needy as she walks past

A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down
Through the Trees blasts from the radio
Needy begins to sing a lopsided grin on her face

NEEDY
(SINGING)
Through the trees I will find
you Heal the ruins left inside
you

EXT MURPHY POOL - NIGHT

Devils Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool
crying Its a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip Their faces
are weary and sorrowful Photos of Chip have been
arranged around the edge of the fence We see a picture
of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end
Someone has brought a CD player and the mourners sing
along their voices soaring
VIGIL ATTENDEES
(SINGING)
And the stars will remind you
well meet again

EXT COUNTY ROAD 9 - CONTINUOUS
Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote
country highway

NEEDY
(SINGING)
Well meet again
A small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the
road Needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the
creek and stoops to pick it up Its Nikolais BOWIE
KNIFE the one he threw into Devils Kettle never to be
seen again
Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband
A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road Needy sticks
her thumb out again
The wagon pulls over to the side of the road The driver
a grizzled older man rolls down the window He eyes
Needy lasciviously

OLD MAN
Where you looking to go young
lady
NEEDY
East toward Madison
OLD MAN
East huh Guess Im headed that
way But Im gonna need you to pay
me in ass gas or grass Got that
No free rides in this wagon
NEEDY
I dont have any money or drugs
so youll have to settle for ass

OLD MAN
Fair enough Hop in my chariot
Needy gratefully hurries into the drivers seat
OLD MAN (CONTD)
So why you headed East

NEEDY

Im following this rock band
OLD MAN

Huh Must be a hell of a group
NEEDY

Tonights gonna be their last

show

Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into
her mouth

The station wagon pulls off As it sputters off into the
distance we see a road sign that reads ironically SOFT
SHOULDER

We hear the song on the radio end segueing into the DJs
bumper
RADIO DJ

What a song Thought wed play

that one in honor of Soft

Shoulder Theyre playing in

Madison tonight Should be a night

to remember
The DJs voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
horizon
THE END
