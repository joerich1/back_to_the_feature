-British fifties a melodrama Were looking at an
ACTRESS - glamorous young - but very much in the back
ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk

REVERSE
A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film his clothes and the
room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s
is staring raptly at the actress

SIDNEY (V0)
All my life Ive been a Looky-
Loo

2 INT GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 2

SLOW-MOTION
We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring
past us with a dazzling smile

SIDNEY (VO)

We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -
thirties an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to
dislike him
SIDNEY (CONTD) (VO) (CONTD)

This is me at the Golden Globe

Awards in LA this year Thats

my Armani tuxedo Thats a Rolex

Sea-Dweller 4000 watch Im

wearing

Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is
at a table with several other people all staring raptly
past us to the stage which is out of shot

SIDNEY (CONTD)
Those people all around me -
theyre all famous Theyre my
friends
Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES
(20s)

SIDNEY (CONTD) (VO) (CONTD)

Thats the actress Sophie Maes

This morning she told me she

would let me have sex with her if

she won the Best Actress Award

Still in SLOW MOTION Sophie suddenly covers her face with
her hands and begins to stand

SIDNEY (CONTD) (VO) (CONTD)

She just won the Best Actress

Award

Sophie walks out of the shot Still sporting the fixed
smile Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in
the room We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of
CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT

SIDNEY (CONTD)
My life didnt used to be like
this
We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves
impossibly looking at

3 EXT LONDON - LEICESTER SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON 3
4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4

a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope craning
their necks to see us more clearly waving cheering
shouting cameras flashing Rain lashes down

A CAPTION reads Sidneys Life One Year Ago Bafta
Awards London

SIDNEY (VO)

Looky-Loos Thats what They call

you when you stand out in the

rain all night just to catch a

glimpse of Them going by

REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet pausing to
wave at the fans

SIDNEY (CONTD)
I used to pretend it was
different for me because I was
getting paid by a magazine or
newspaper whatever But thats
you knowI just loved watching
Them Id stand outside looking
in through the window and think
what it would be like to somehow
get inside But there was only
one way to get past the thin red
line that separates the
celebrities from the civilians
You had to be famous

4A EXT SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A

Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security
gate He has a small ugly PIG on a leash

PR WOMAN
Babe

SIDNEY
Babe Three Yeah
She looks doubtfully at the pig

PR WOMAN
Babe was a cute little piglet
SIDNEY
Harry Potter used to be a cute
little piglet too What do you
want Tempus Fugits

PR WOMAN
He hasnt got any ID

SIDNEY
How many pigs are coming tonight
Look I was told to bring him
hand him over to the producer
Bob Milton inside You want me
to leave him here with you
thats fine

PR WOMAN
No you cant leave him with me

She looks around helplessly She begins to unhook the red

rope Sidney tries to hide his excitement
PR WOMAN (CONTD)
If youre positive that youre

supposed to
An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over

OLDER PR WOMAN

(ICILY)
Well well Sidney Young

SIDNEY

(RUMBLED)
Well wellclipboard Nazi-type
woman
She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them

OLDER PR WOMAN
The pig doesnt get in

She starts to walk away

SIDNEY
What about me
OLDER PR WOMAN
I was talking about you

5 MOMENTS LATER 5

Sidney and the Pig are being escorted away from the red

carpet by the Security

SIDNEY (VO)

The Looky-Loos dream is that one
day they will somehow get to
mingle with the stars But the
Industry cant allow any
mingling Stars have to be kept
away from civilians have to be
quarantined so they dont become
normal Like us

They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other

way She looks curiously at the pig as
stares after her longingly

6 INT SANDERSON HOTEL - EVENING 6

she passes Sidney

TRACKING through the doors and into the lobby of the

exclusive hotel

SIDNEY (V0)

But after the awards come the
parties - the Miramax Party the
London Records Party and best of
all - the Sharps Magazine Party
so exclusive that there are no
pass-alongs no plus-ones no
press

We find Sidney checking in at the desk

SIDNEY (CONTD)
(to Receptionist

HORRIFIED)

How much I only want to stay for
one night

7 INT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 7

Sidney stands in the rising elevator

suit bag in his hand
holdall at his feet
SIDNEY (V0)

This is where the movie stars can

finally relax secure in the

knowledge they are among their

own kind

We see the PIGS SNOUT poking out of the zip of the
holdall

8 INT HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 8

Sidney turns from the mirror to face us He is wearing a
WAITERS UNIFORM of white shirt waistcoat and bow tie He
is also wearing a WIG and FALSE MOUSTACHE

SIDNEY (VO)

And that is when I strike

He picks up a tray of canapés from the bed and looks down
to where the Pig watches him from the floor

SIDNEY (CONTD)
I want you in bed by ten And no
porn
He tosses the pig one of the canapés

9 INT HOTEL - EVENING 9

Sidney tray in hand peers around the corner to the
entrance to the hotels roofed COURTYARD The Older PR
Woman we saw earlier stands at the door a formidable
presence As we watch she greets an approaching CELEBRITY
gushingly Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door
and tray held aloft to cover his face slips through into
the courtyard beyond

10 INT HOTEL COURTYARD - SHARPS MAGAZINE PARTY - MOMENTS 10

LATER
as Sidney emerges from the washrooms now dressed only
in the white shirt and black trousers He scoops up a
passing glass of champagne checks his moustache and
surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour tanned
skin diamonds beautiful dresses beautiful suits
champagne He stands surveying the crowd of A-list
celebrities in front of him dazed

SIDNEY

(TO HIMSELF)
You can do this You belong here
Youre a star Youre a big
bright shining star

11 INT HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 11

The room is trashed - furniture over-turned mini-bar open
and broken bottles all over the floor A weird squealing
which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom

ASSISTANT MANAGER (0S)
Hello Sir
The squealing stops

ASSISTANT MANAGER (CONTD)

Is everything alright

The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and
stands staring around him in horror Behind him the pig
emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door
across the corridor and straight into the open lift

12 INT SHARPS PARTY - EVENING 12
Sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk Hollywood

believe this - she likes him

13 INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 13

The lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around
the corner The PR Woman is still at the door to the
courtyard berating one of her staff The Pig sails past
them both unnoticed and disappears into the party

14 INT SHARPES PARTY - EVENING 14

A YOUNG MAN sits drinking at a table He slips a little bag
of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one

UNDER THE TABLE

As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket The
Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back
out and DROPS to the floor The Pig sniffs at the bag

15 SIDNEY AND HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 15

»Still talking The place is crammed now and hot Sidney
wipes sweat from his forehead

HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS

SIDNEY
Clark Clark Baxter
He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes
loose and hangs limply from his face

SIDNEY (CONTD)

Howd you do

The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesnt
notice - he is staring past her to where there is something
of a COMMOTION amongst the guests The PR Woman is hurrying
across the room hissing into her ear-piece Somebody
screams Then to Sidneys horror a group of guests scatter
in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed the
Pig charges into view heading straight for him

SIDNEY (CONTD)

(MUTTERING)
Oh shit
The Pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at Sidney with
hot eyes The PR Woman follows the Pigs gaze and spots
Sidney

OLDER PR WOMAN

(INTO HEADSET)

HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS

(FEARFULLY)

SIDNEY
Oh shit

Sidney turns and legs it

ACROSS THE ROOM
We are looking OVER THE SHOULDER of a tall grey-haired MAN
who stands in the shadows watching Sidney run past This is
CLAYTON HARDING his face hidden for the time being

He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches
Sidneys flight rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his
fingers

BACK WITH SIDNEY

-as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles
Sidney screams trips and flies through the air wig
spinning free hurtling straight towards a table of
startled celebrities We FREEZE FRAME

A seedy flat in Shepherds bush

17 INT SIDNEYS FLAT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 17

Sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear A
phone is RINGING in the next room

Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the
papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and
some Security Men The phone continues to ring

SIDNEY

(CALLING)
Will you get that (Beat) Will

Sighing he gets up and scratching himself stumbles through
to

18 LIVING ROOM 18
which we see is bizarrely an OFFICE - full of an odd
assortment of JOURNALISTS desks antiquated computers and
an old fax machine The walls are lined with past covers
from Sidneys magazine - The Post-Modern Review One bears
a photograph of Victoria Beckham with the title Posh
Spice Like Fuck She Is

A JOURNALIST is talking on the phone by the door The other
phone is still ringing

JOURNALIST

Look we dont hate celebrities

at the Post-Modern Review okay

We just dont think they should

be taking themselves so

seriously For us a celebrity is

a text to be deconstructed Apart

from Costner obviously

Sidney edges past him to where a LARGE WOMAN and a
histrionic THIN MAN are in the middle of a argument
encouraged by the other members of staff

THIN MAN

(SHRILL)
I wouldnt do this the honour of
calling it a review Its a
puerile personal attack in in
alcoholic prose in which

misquote both Derrida and
Lyotard I ama

with a bored YOUNG MAN sitting by it

glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones
Orlando Bloom Claytons hand sifts one copy from the
others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF

Sidney and the Woman dance drunkenly around the room to the
music blaring from Sidneys stereo The track finishes and
they stand gasping for breath

little more romantic
She staggers off down the hall Sidney giddy with
excitement searches through some LPs and puts one on his
old turntable Its Ace of Spades by Motorhead He staggers
around playing air-guitar for a moment

The music is suddenly switched off He turns to find Mrs
Kowalski standing beside the record player staring grimly
at him

SIDNEY

As the song continues we see Sidney swagger down the busy
sidewalk towards us He is wearing sunglasses and a T-shirt
emblazoned with a photograph of Keanu Reeves and the
caption Young Dumb and Full of CumThe T-shirt is riding
up a little over his belly

SIDNEY (V0)

This is my city

He stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the
Heywood Building towering above him

35 INT HEYWOOD BUILDING - ENTRANCE SECURITY - MORNING 35

As the song continues Sidney still swaggering is escorted
through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic
ASSISTANT The entrance hall arches above them a vast and
impressive cavern of chrome and glass

SIDNEY (VO)
This is my building

36 INT LIFT - MOMENTS LATER 36

Sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift
examining the Chic Assistant and two stunningly beautiful
MODELS who are in conversation Sidney manages to catch the
attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes
is a rakish smile In return he receives an icy glare

SIDNEY (V0)
These are my models

37 INT SHARPS MAGAZINE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 37
The Chic Assistant leads Sidney down a curving red
carpeted corridor past a chrome wall inscribed with the
giant logo of the magazine They reach a set of double
doors which the Assistant opens for Sidney

And this
Sidney walks through into

Harding swings around in his chair to glare at us a
cigarette in his mouth

SIDNEY (V0)

CLAYTON HARDING

The song grinds to an abrupt halt Sidney loses a quantity
of swagger He examines his T-shirt

SIDNEY
You like it I brought you one
He takes a T-shirt from his satchel and hands it to
Harding

CLAYTON HARDING
Thanks

Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind
him

CLAYTON HARDING (CONTD)

Next time you come here dressed
like that you follow the shirt
You understand

Sidney nods dumbly

CLAYTON HARDING (CONTD)
Sit down How was the flight

SIDNEY

(SITTING)
Good Thanks for the business
class tickets Clay
Harding regards him gravely

CLAYTON HARDING
That was a mistake And dont
call me Clay

SIDNEY
Oh Well if its any consolation
I got downgraded anyway

CLAYTON HARDING

(GRAVELY)
That is some consolation
Sidney notices that the copy of The Post-Modern Review is
on the desk - Clayton NAKED

SIDNEY

(NERVOUSLY)
Ha That was just a little uh
as it happens Im a big fan of
your earlier funnier work Snipe
Magazine that wasthat was
really good

Harding stares at Sidney

SIDNEY (CONTD)
Yeah youveyouve actually
been a big influence on me and I

inject a bit of that Snipe spirit
into this magazine Now Ive got
a few ideas that Id like to

CLAYTON HARDING

(INTERRUPTING)
You think youve arrived doncha
Well I hate to break it to you
but youre only in the first
room Its not nothing dont get
me wrong but there are plenty of
people in this town who never
made it past the first room
After a year or so maybe longer

youll discover a secret doorway

at the back of the first room

that leads to the second

Eventually if youre lucky

youll discover another doorway

back of the second room that

leads to the third
He gazes at Sidney through narrowed eyes

CLAYTON HARDING (CONTD)

There are seven rooms in all

Youre in the first Im in the

seventh and doncha forget it

Sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration

SIDNEY

(BEAT)
Soif I make it to the Seventh
Room - will I become a true Jedi
Knight
Harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette

CLAYTON HARDING
Which brings us to the subject of
your sense of humour I hada
look through your magazine
here

SIDNEY
Whatd you think
Clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out
over the Manhattan skyline

CLAYTON HARDING
Oh I thought it waskinda
snarky And bitter And
witless

Sidney digests this Clayton seems lost in thought
Finally

CLAYTON HARDING (CONTD)

Im going to try you out in the I
Spy Section
39 INT CORRIDOR - DAY 39

Sidney is hurrying to keep up with LAWRENCE MADDOX (40s)
as he strides down the corridor Lawrence is Canadian
handsome one of the golden boys of the magazine and
arrogant with it Other EMPLOYEES pass them as they walk
heads down expressions serious The place is a model of
quiet professional industry

LAWRENCE MADDOX
(glancing at Sidneys

CLOTHES )
Well Sidney Weve only just met

the presence of a rare comic
sensibility

SIDNEY
Thanks

LAWRENCE MADDOX
I know your Hi-jinx gave you a

42 INT LOBBY - LIFT - DAY 42

Sidney coming back from lunch gets into the lift eating a
HAMBURGER Another of the magazines Fashionistas - ANNA -
gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an
approaching friend The doors swish shut Anna pulling her
hand out of the way just in time The lift rises

SIDNEY
Its fashion sensitive If youre
not wearing Prada itll take your
arm clean off
Anna stares at this strange man with the burger baffled

ANNA
But I am wearing Prada
The lift stops and she gets out Alison gets in sees
Sidney and winces She takes out a book and pretends to
read The lift begins to rise again
Through its glass doors we see the different floors
passing different publications - each a hive of sober
hard work Sidney stares at them

SIDNEY

(MOUTH FULL)
This isnt what I expected
Alison recoils slightly

ALISON
What did you expect

SIDNEY
I dont know The Algonquin
circle Dorothy Parker Martinis
Quips Look at them Not one of
them is drunk

ALISON
Its called being a professional
You should try it some time

SIDNEY
Theres something you should
understand Im not really one of

ALISON
By you do you mean human

SIDNEY
I mean the glossy posse Bunch of
Zombies writing about Pets of
the Stars but acting like
theyre working for the UN Im
here to shake things up a bit
Where are you from

ALISON
Not that its any of your
business but Im from Port
Huron Michigan

SIDNEY
Right Small town girl (Hannibal
Lector impersonation) I bet you
could only dream of getting out
Getting anywhere - yes Clarice
Getting all the way - to the
NYC (Dropping the
impersonation) Take my advice
dont go taking this celebrity
fluff seriously
For a moment Alison is speechless with anger

ALISON
Youyouarrogant

The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters She is expensively
dressed wears Chanel dark glasses an expression of
granite and an air of superhuman froideur

Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares
tensely ahead Only Sidney busy chewing is oblivious to
the plunge in temperature

For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift Then
Sidney begins to choke on some burger He wheezes for a
moment gagging

The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of
having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her
Alison closes her eyes

Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger
and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back
of the oblivious Womans Prada jacket

Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the
offending item away

Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist ina
vice-like grip

43 CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 43
Alison is haranguing Sidney

ALISON

(HISSING)
Are you insane That was
Lawrences wife Elizabeth Her

SIDNEY

ALISON
Yes

SIDNEY
I dont know the meaning of the
word fear

ALISON

She walks on shaking her head in disbelief

ALISON (CONTD)

brains God gave a molluscwhy

SIDNEY

(FOLLOWING HER)

might still be in time to save
him

rocking slightly forward

Cuba bounding forward jumps into the air

Sidney just manages to slam the window SHUT as

the sky Suddenly

Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing

SIDNEY (CONTD)

shrubbery below

in thought swigging absently from a bottle of wine

89 EXT POOL - EVENING 89

Sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water
and nursing the beginnings of a hangover We hear faint
music and laughter from where the party continues in the
house behind

He notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water
and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars The
reflection dissolves into ripples When the water settles
Sophie Maes reflection stares back at him

Shes drunk and a good deal of the movie star mystique
seems to have evaporated

SOPHIE MAES
You know what Theres something
very damaged about you
Sidney stares at her not sure what to say

SIDNEY

Huh

Sophie lies down beside the pool plays with a strand of
her hair

SOPHIE MAES
Like an animal thats been hit by
a car or something Like a deer
orlike a pig maybe When they
walk funny and the other animals
eep away from them Little limpy
pig Im drawn to sick animals
Thats why I picked Cuba -
because he had like psychological

corner of the room He selects the finale music - its
funny and sad glamorous and romantic They listen to it
for a moment Sidney starts to dance a little He cha-chas
over to her and holds out his hand

ALISON
Are you kidding I could throw up
on you again

SIDNEY
Cmon
Alison reluctantly gets up They dance ironically Alison
laughs a little
Gradually they get more into it enjoying the music - a man
in shorts and a woman in pyjamas cha-cha-chaing a summer
breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind
him

near the back

She is holding her notebook watching the movie Beside her
is the remains of a picnic with lit candles

Sidney smiles and starts towards her then stops She is
sitting next to a MAN As Sidney watches she rests her head
on his shoulder

Sidney watches numb then turns to walk away

BOB stands in front of him in full drag waving
frantically He starts to run towards Sidney who sighs and
closes his eyes - as if things werent bad enough

Then Bob runs straight past him Sidney turns to see the
Man next to Alison standing up to embrace Bob The two
kiss

ON THE GRASS

Alison watches Bob and her friend embrace with a touch of
sadness Suddenly she realises someone is standing beside
her She looks up and sees Sidney

She stares at him Long Beat

Sidney holds out his hand

Alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up

SIDNEY
Hows the novel
ALISON

Finished

Sidney smiles He takes the notebook from her and tosses it
back onto the picnic blanket Then he kisses her As he
does so he takes the RING and slips it into Alisons coat
pocket
Then they begin to dance cha-cha-chaaing happily at the
back of the park as the music swells lit by the
flickering light from the screen

Suddenly Sidney freezes staring over Alisons shoulder to
where we can see he has accidentally thrown her NOTEBOOK
onto a lit candle
It is now ON FIRE
Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book
