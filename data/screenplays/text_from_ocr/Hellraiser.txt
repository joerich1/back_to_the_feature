TITLE SEQUENCE

In darkness a blood-curdling cacophony the squeal
of unoiled winches the rasp of hooks and razors
being sharpened and worse the howl of tormented
souls Above this din one particular victim yells
for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage

By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by
the surrounding tumult until without warning his
voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time
reduced to naked scream

And with the sound an image

A house Number 55 Lodovico Street an old three
storey late Victorian house with gaunt trees lining
its overgrown garden Its curtains are drawn there
is newspaper over its top window The titles begin
to run aS we approach the house down the driveway

We move inside to the hallway The cries are
louder now

Room by room we explore the empty house while the
titles continue to run It has been left empty for
many years though much of its furniture remains
covered in dust-sheets On the mantelpiece of one room
a plaster saint In the kitchen evidence of life

here Opened tins bread bottles of spirits a

glass

We move upstairs gliding along the corridor of the
lower landing The din is furious now On the
floor of one room a makeshift bed blankets strewn
an open suitcase more liquor

We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper
landing the door of which is ajar The light
within swings backwards and forwards spilling into
the passageway

As we reach the door the screams from within halt
abruptly

We can hear a bell now which has been pealing
steadily throughout this opening sequence

As we move through the door the titles end

INT TORTURE ROOM NIGHT

The bare bulbs in the room weve entered swing violently
disorienting us There are chains - dozens of them -
disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling all

are swinging back and forth Some end in hooks with
Continued

pieces of skin and sinew adhering some are serrated
others simply drip blood

The bell tolls on

On the blood-spattered floor a box some six inches
square which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle
box Later well learn its name and function

Its called the Lament Configuration and its a
way to raise Hell Literally For now it remains
an enigma

A hand its flesh systematically pierced with needles
reaches down and picks the box up

In close up we see just what an elaborate construction
it is made up of sliding panels and mysterious
chambers It is open at present its polished

innards exposed Out of it a banal melody played

on a hidden mechanism The hands which belong to

one of the demons - a Cenobite - move over the box

CENOBITE
(unseen)
Its over

Delicately the hands begin to reconstruct the box
sliding the well-oiled parts back into place the
tune simplifying with each manoeuvre

The room is getting darker The chains are disappearing
into the gloom

We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures turning
from the light and fading into the darkness We catch
sight of monstrous faces but only for the briefest

of moments Then theyre gone

The box is almost returned to its unopened condition

The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box
and the bell

It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid
into place

The light stops swinging The panel clicks The tune
stops

At last a long shot of the room At the far end the
window is covered with yellowed newspapers There is

dust settling through the air

Otherwise it is empty
Continued

The bell fades

Its as if nothing ever happened here

Except

Somewhere very quietly a creaking that could be

the sound of floorboards or the low agonized gasp
of a thing barely alive

INT HALLWAY DAY

The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number
55 From the doorstep voices One is that of
LARRY COTTON the other his wife JULIA Clearly
LARRY is attempting to get inside We hear the
sound of keys tried in the lock

LARRY
Its one of these

JULIA
Were going to freeze to death

LARRY
OK OK

The sound of another key tried in the lock

JULIA
Maybe somebody changed the lock

LARRY
(slightly irritated)

Like who

JULIA
Just a thought -

LARRY
Ah

The key is turned

LARRY
Success

The door swings open
Voila
We see the pair on the doorstep LARRY is an American

in his early forties an attractive man who has lost
his edge in recent years He looks harassed he smirks
Continued

too much A little but significant corner of him
is utterly defeated JULIA his wife is English
and looks perhaps ten years his junior She is
beautiful but her face betrays a barely buried
unhappiness Life has disappointed her too of
late and LARRY has been a major part of their
disappointment

LARRY
Well This is it

They step over the threshold

INT UPPER LANDING DAY

The door of the Torture Room creaks as the wind blows
it opens an inch From downstairs we hear JULIAs
voice

JULIA
It smells damp

LARRY
Its just been empty a while

INT HALLWAY DAY

LARRY slams the front door

INT UPPER LANDING DAY

The Torture Room door creaks closed again
LARRY

(from below)
Besides its an old house

INT HALLWAY DAY

He stands in the hallway not certain which way to
go from here

JULIA
How long since you were here

LARRY
The best part of ten years

LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from
behind the door then leads JULIA through from the
hallway to explore the ground floor
Continued

LARRY
I wanted to sell it off at
one point after the old Lady
died but I couldnt get Frank
to agree

He opens one of the doors and looks inside

LARRY
(with pleasure)
Christ Its not been touched

He continues along the passageway He opens another
door and steps into a large room He opens one of

the curtains Light pours in dust-laden shafts falling
on the sheeted furniture

LARRY
Look at this

JULIA lingers in the doorway

JULIA
Why didnt he want to sell it

LARRY
(dismissively)
I dont know Probably wanted
a hideaway

He pulls a sheet off a chair
Look at this stuff
The chair is ugly old fashioned JULIA is unimpressed

JULIA
Not exactly modern

LARRY
(shrugs)
Well sell it Sell everything

JULIA
I thought half of it was your
brothers

LARRY
He wont complain He can pay
off some of his creditors

LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by
the moment He leaves the room moving past JULIA
to explore further
Continued

LARRY
You know we have to let Kirsty
see this place before we do
anything to it Shell love it

JULIA
You mean were moving in

LARRY pauses Looks at her

LARRY
You dont like it

JULIA shrugs

JULIA
Its better than Brooklyn

She turns back down the hallway He watches her then
follows

LARRY
Youre still blaming me

JULIA
No Im not

LARRY
You wanted to come back to
London We came back

We are hearing the tip of a debate theyve had dozens
of times which immediately annoys them both

JULIA
All right

LARRY
So whats the argument

JULIA
(cold)
No argument

LARRY
Oh Christ Julia

JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs Then
starts to climb

LARRY
(exasperated to
himself)

Shit

INT LANDING DAY

JULIA climbs the stairs her face charged with suppressed

feeling Shes sick of LARRY his enthusiasm depresses
her his compromises anger her Whats between them
is stale like this house

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

The door opens a fraction

INT KITCHEN DAY

LARRY has stepped into the kitchen to find the remains
of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence
now rotted and fungal It smells to judge the
expression on his face It also puzzles him Then
from above

JULIA
Larry

He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the
bottom of the stairs

Larry
LARRY
I hear you
He starts up the stairs
INT LOWER LANDING DAY

LARRY reaches the top of the stairs

LARRY
Where are you

JULIA
(out of sight)
In here

LARRY follows JULIAs voice to the end of the corridor
JULIA is standing in a doorway Beyond the bedroom
we saw in the titles sequence untouched since then

JULIA
Squatters

LARRY steps past her and throws back the blankets
Wood-lice scurry away He goes to the suitcase and
starts looking through it Besides clothes theres a
lot else that speaks of its owner bric-a-brac picked
up in a lifetime of adventuring handful of bullets

Continued

fragments of an erotic statue coins and notes from

a dozen countries Amongst the stuff some photographs
LARRY peers at them One pictures a good-looking
intense man in his mid to late thirties in bed

with a naked Chinese girl

LARRY
Frank

At the door we see JULIA almost flinch at the name

JULIA
Hes here

LARRY
Hes been here Theres stuff
in the kitchen He must have
made a hasty exit

The phone rings downstairs JULIA jumps
Thatll be Kirsty

LARRY stands up and leaves the room moving past JULIA
in the doorway who is left to stare down at the

bed FRANK has slept in and the suitcase of belongings
As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIAs
face is close to tears

INT DOWNSTATRS ROOM DAY

The phone continues to ring LARRY steps through
and picks up the receiver

LARRY
Hello
Theres no answer
Hello
INT FRANKS BEDROOM DAY

JULIA goes to the open suitcase and looks at the
photographs

INT DOWNSTAIRS ROOM DAY
LARRY
(onphone)

Continued

He puts down the phone He goes back out into the
hall

INT FRANKS BEDROOM DAY

Nervous that LARRY will return and see what shes
doing JULIA is going through the photographs

LARRY
(from below)
Theres nobody there -

The sound of his foot on the stairs MHurriedly she

selects a photograph of Frank without the girl and
pockets it

INT STAIRS DAY

LARRY is climbing the stairs

LARRY
Im surprised its even connected

The phone rings again

Shit

INT FRANKS BEDROOM DAY

Mission accomplished JULIA leaves the bedroom taking
one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the
indented pillar where Frank lay A lone wood-louse
crawls over the sheet navigating the folds She
closes the door on the sight Downstairs the

phone stops ringing

INT DOWNSTATRS ROOM DAY

LARRY has picked up the phone

LARRY
Whos there

KIRSTY
(barely audible)
Daddy

INT KIRSTYS ROOM DAY

KIRSTY the daughter of Larrys first marriage and
his only child on the phone She is barely twenty
beautiful in an unpretensious way a dream of a girl-
next-door We cant see much of the room shes in at
the moment the shot is too tight

LARRY (V0)

INT DOWNSTAIRS ROOM DAY

LARRY
(on phone)

INT KIRSTYS ROOM DAY

KIRSTY
I said I found a room

We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now as she continues to
speak to her father Shes sitting on a battered chair
by the door The room shes in is cramped and dirty

From outside the sound of trains going by

LARRY (V0)
I thought you were going to
stay with us for awhile

KIRSTY
(pained)
No Dad

LARRY (V0)
Youd like the house

KIRSTY
Youd like my room

LARRY (V0)

KIRSTY
(hastily)
No no Not just yet It
needs er some work

That it does The place now weve got a good view
of it is a total dump

LARRY (V0)
Well I want you to see the

house

KIRSTY
Im not going to change my
mind Dad

As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture
tacked to the wall of a ourangoutang with breasts
collaged onto it down She succeeds Beneath theres
a large hole in the wall which the picture was there
to conceal Plaster falls from it

KIRSTY
(mouths the word)
Great

LARRY (V0)
Well come over will you
See the place

KIRSTY
Maybe tomorrow I got to go
look for a job

LARRY (V0)
OK Honey Well you take care

KIRSTY

She puts the receiver down As she does so the small

table on which the phone is sitting collapses She
covers her face with her hand

INT HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET DAY

JULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs

LARRY
Well

Continued
JULIA
(resigned)
Why not
LARRY
(smiles hes pleased)
Well move in Sunday
INT DOWNSTAIRS ROOM DAY

A church bell rings Off-screen we hear voices
two men are attempting to move a bed into the house
with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres We hear
their efforts but we dont yet see them Our
interest is in JULIA who is unpacking a tea-chest
in a room which is still full of draped furniture

1ST MAN (0S)
Were not going to get it in

2ND MAN (0S)
Tip it Tip it

LARRY (0S)
Wait Wait Watch the fucking

the man says

LARRY (0OS)

1ST MAN
Famous last fucking words

JULIAs face through this has been almost devoid of
expression Shes holding so many feelings inside
deep inside Now she moves from one box to another
and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac
She picks it up and goes through into the hallway

The bell continues to ring

INT HALLWAY DAY

The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the
door

LARRY
(not seeing Julia)
Alright lets give it another
try

2ND MAN

JULIA

2ND MAN
Got any beer

JULIA
Theres some in the fridge

Nobody moves to get it Certainly JULIA has no
intention of being waitress She goes to the bottom
of the stairs

LARRY
Ill get it

LARRY disappears through into the kitchen JULIA
starts up the stairs watched appreciatively by the
two men in the doorway One leans over and whispers
to the other who laughs JULIA glances back at
them The whisperer licks his lips the meaning

of the gesture perfectly apparent JULIA heads
upstairs

EXT NUMBER 55 DAY

KIRSTY arrives at the head of the drive The two
men are drinking beers The bed has not been moved

She wanders down the drive towards the house

26 EXT DOORSTEP DAY

2ND MAN

She moves past them attempting to insinuate herself

between the bed and the door-jamb They watch
enjoying her efforts

27 INT HALLWAY DAY

2ND MAN

Lucky man
LARRY

Damn right Now are we going
to move the bed or not

INT KITCHEN DAY

The kitchen is chaotic Cutlery crockery utensils
pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every
available surface KIRSTY has found the kettle

but is having difficulty turning on the tap She
struggles with it No joy Just a rattling sound
in the pipes as the system lurches into action

INT LOWER LANDING DAY

The pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster The
CAMERA moves along the corridor hugging the wall
At the end of the corridor stands JULIA ina

patch of sunlight She has the photograph of FRANK
in her hands

She looks intently at it

A CLOSE-UP of the photograph Then FRANKs voice

FRANK
Can I come in

JULIA looks up from the photograph

INT JULIAS FLASHBACK DAY

A front door opens On the step of another house
stands FRANK with two suitcases Its raining
outside hard The rain has plastered his hair to
his scalp which only emphasizes his raw good looks
Hes unshaven his eyes are dark and intense
Again the line she remembers

FRANK
Can I come in

The splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of
water aS we

CUT BACK TO

the present day

INT KITCHEN DAY

The tap has come on suddenly spraying KIRSTY with
water She jumps back soaked

KIRSTY
Shit Shit

She reaches to turn the pressure down

32 INT HALLWAY DAY

The men are struggling with the bed again

LARRY
(calls through)
Are you OK

KIRSTY
(from kitchen)
Sure
33 INT LOWER LANDING DAY

Again JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph

34 INT JULIAS FLASHBACK DAY

The same scene FRANK in the doorstep Now we
CUT TO

the person who opened the door Its JULIA a younger
JULIA her hair arranged differently her clothes
brighter It is two weeks before her marriage to
LARRY She looks at the man on the doorstep without

a trace of recognition on her face

FRANK
Youre Julia right

JULIA
Thats right Who are you

FRANK
(a dazzling smile)
Im brother Frank

JULIA
(smiles)
Oh
FRANK
I came for the wedding

He looks at her eyes glittering His hold on her
is almost mesmeric

There is going to be a wedding

JULIA

Oh Oh yes

Continued

FRANK
Well can I come in or not

JULIA
Im sorry Of course Youre
very welcome

He steps inside Now he is close to her rain running
down his face We can hear his breath sense the
almost intimidating intimacy of his presence

FRANK
Thats nice to know
(pause)
Have you got a towel

INT LOWER LANDING DAY

JULIA stares down at the photograph Off scrren
KIRSTYs voice

KIRSTY (0S)
Have you got a towel

JULIA looks up At the top of the stairs KIRSTY
soaked from the tap JULIA looks up and hurriedly
pockets the photograph

JULIA
Kirsty

KIRSTY
Hi I got soaked

JULIA
Theres a towel in the bath-
room

KIRSTY

Which is where

JULIA
Just to your left

KIRSTY ducks into the bathroom We
CUT BACK TO
JULIA Its clear the memory of her first meeting

with FRANK has affected her deeply The tears that
threatened earlier are close

INT BATHROOM DAY

KIRSTY has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself

KIRSTY
Did Dad tell you I got a room
by the way Waterloo Centre
of the known universe

Silence from outside

Julia
(she puts her head
out of the bathroom)
INT LOWER LANDING DAY

JULIA has gone

INT UPPER LANDING DAY

The door of the Torture Room is pushed open JULIA
steps inside

INT LOWER LANDING DAY

KIRSTY hears the creak of footsteps on the boards
above JULIAs behaviour puzzles her but shes
not about to waste time thinking too hard about it
She starts downstairs again

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

We have an odd hovering point of view of JULIA
as she steps inside the room Something about the
atmosphere distresses her

There is a scratching sound She looks down A
wood-louse recalling Franks foresaken bed crawls
along the edge of the skirting board She crosses
to the window and tears away a little spy-hole

in the aged newspaper

From downstairs the voices of the bed-movers

1ST MAN
Have you got it

2ND MAN
Ive got it I told you -

LARRY
Wait Wait

Continued
The light through the window falls on her eye

The screen becomes a white-out from which emerges

INT JULIAS FLASHBACK DAY

A bedroom with afternoon sunlight pouring between
the slats of bamboo blinds Outside we can hear
children playing summer games Inside a fly buzzes

JULIA the younger self is holding her wedding
dress in front of her displaying it

JULIA
Well

FRANK (0S)
I dont want to see the dress

JULIA
But you said -

FRANK
I dont want to see the dress

JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front of
her She stares at FRANK

FRANK
You know what I want

Still she doesnt let the defence that the dress
offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall
She stares though and theres an invitation in her
eyes

FRANK
I want you

Now we

CUT TO
FRANK He is not so beraggled as in the first scene
but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat
to his face Standing half in shadow he looks almost

dangerous

Now JULIA lets the dress drop putting it on the
bed behind her

FRANK
Thats better

FRANK steps towards her

Continued

JULIA
What about Larry -

FRANK
Forget him

FRANK takes hold of her She doesnt resist him

though there is barely disguised fear on her face
He puts his hand inside her blouse

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

In extreme CLOSE UP JULIA blinks into the light
through the window as LARRYs voice from downstairs
calls her from her reverie

LARRY
Slowly will you Slowly

Again a white-CUT from which emerges

INT JULIAS FLASHBACK DAY

The two are naked on the bed both sweating now
Beneath them the wedding dress crushed under their
weight

Their love-making is not straight-forward there is
an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK
licks at her face almost like an animal his hold
on her too tight to be loving The sequence
escalates into a series of strange details from
their locked bodies Nails digging into palms
sweat rivulets running down their torsoes And
once in a while we see their faces JULIA watching
FRANK mesmerized and amused by his intensity
FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the
experience to the limit Their passion is rendered
stranger still by the way the light through the window

falls on their bodies making striped creatures of them

At last as their urgency increases we move up
until were looking directly down on the bed
From here it is JULIAs face we can see and the
ecstasy of the moment has seized her Her arms
are flung up over her head her eyes are closed
as she murmurs

JULIA
Oh my God Oh my God Oh
my God

The scene whites out

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

JULIA is still staring into the light She sobs very
quietly

JULIA

(a whisper)
Oh Frank

INT HALLWAY DAY

Downstairs LARRY and the men have moved the bed
across the hall to the bottom of the stairs

All three are weary now and getting careless

As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead
for LARRY whose hand is moving closer and closer
to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the
bannister

LARRY
(to Movers)
Will you take the weight while
I take a step up

He backs towards the stairs - and the nail

Damn it will you take the -
The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail He cries
out The weight of the bed which he cannot relinquish
drives the nail deeper and gouges a long cut from

the ball of his thumb to his wrist Blood pours out

LARRY
Christ

1ST MAN
Whats the problem

LARRY
My fucking hand

He drops his edge of the bed and disengages his hand
from the nail upon which hes injured himself He
lifts his hand from which blood is pouring

LARRY
You fucking ass-holes

1ST MAN
Who are you calling a fucking
ass-hole Its this bastard
bed thats your fucking problem

Continued

LARRY isnt listening Hes looking at the wound
in his hand He hates the sight of his own blood
Any moment he may faint

LARRY
» Oh Christ

But not in front of these bastards He turns and
starts up the stairs groggier by the moment

LARRY
-» oh Christ
INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

JULIA is standing in the middle of the room A single
dart of light through the hole she tore in the
newspaper strikes her face Softly on the soundtrack
the scrabbling noise of the woodlice

INT HALLWAY DAY

The bed has been put down 1ST MAN and 2ND MAN are
putting on their coats KIRSTY comes through from
the kitchen

KIRSTY
Whats happening

2ND MAN
Were leaving

KIRSTY
Wheres my father

1ST MAN

2ND MAN
(mock chiding)
Eh language

1ST MAN

2ND MAN takes a sheet of paper from his jacket

2ND MAN
Will you sign for the bed

KIRSTY
Sure

INT STAIRS DAY

LARRY his hand running with blood climbs the last
flight of stairs

LARRY
(weakly)
» Julia
INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

JULIA hears him and turns from her silent communing with
the room She crosses towards the door Too late

It opens LARRY steps inside blood pouring from

his right hand which he attempts to staunch with his
left hand

JULIA
What have you done

LARRY
I cut myself

Blood has started to drip unnoticed by either of them
onto the bare boards Heavy splashes

LARRY looks sick his face clammy with sweat She stares
at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face

JULIA
Is it deep

LARRY
I dont know I havent looked
You know me and blood

JULIA
Youre not going to faint

LARRY
(he leans againts
the wall)
Shit
JULIA

Let me see

She goes to him He looks away as she unglues one hand
from the other and looks at the wound Blood comes faster
hitting the floor between them

JULIA
Its probably going to need
stitches

49 Continued

LARRY
Im going to throw up

JULIA
No youre not

The blood keeps hitting the floor Slap slap slap

Well get you out into the
fresh air

He is again clamping his hand over the wound as JULIA
helps him to the door They leave the Torture Room
We hear their voices receding down the passageway

as we again assume that hovering view point The
floor is heavily spattered with blood

JULIA
Take it slowly

LARRY
So damn stupid

JULIA
Youre done worse

LARRY
Ill be scarred for life

JULIA
No you wont

50 INT HALLWAY DAY

KIRSTY is half way up the stairs as JULIA and LARRY
head down

KIRSTY
What happened

JULIA
Just an accident Hes all
right Will you drive He
needs stitches

KIRSTY
Sure

JULIA
The keys are in the kitchen

KIRSTY heads back to the kitchen JULIA helps LARRY
towards the front door

Continued

The CAMERA swings away from them upstairs and
begins to track

LAP-DISSOLVE TO

INT UPPER LANDING DAY

we continue to track towards the Torture Room
Downstairs the front door slams
LAP-DISSOLVE TO

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

From outside the sound of a car door slamming An
engine starts The car drives away

We move towards the blood on the floor As we watch
it begins to disappear as if being absorbed by the
room We pan up to the wall The plaster is not
quite smooth indeed it now begins to grow restless
and cracks Something begins to move in the wall

INT DINING ROOM NIGHT

An explosion of laughter We
CUT TO

the remains of a rack of lamb its gravy now congealed
scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there

This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a
battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen
We pass along the table taking in dirty plates and
cutlery napkins glasses and emptied wine bottles
Finally we reach JULIA who is still sitting at the
table while the others have retired to more comfortable
seats She looks utterly miserable and a little

drunk

The room has been spruced up for the party Candles
are burning on tables and mantelpiece there are
pictures on the walls But this is essentially
cosmetic The place has not been refurnished or re-
decorated

We move to the party guests Two we recognize
KIRSTY and LARRY - who is presently entertaining

the gathering with an account of his accident The
others are new faces An American couple BILL
UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN who are of an age with
LARRY and a younger bespectacled man - a work
colleague of LARRYs - STEVE ODONNELL All are drunk

Continued

A brandy bottle sits on the table between them and
half a dozen other liquer bottles besides STEVE
it soon becomes apparent has his eyes on KIRSTY

LARRY is half-way through his hospital story
gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale
much to the pleasure of the rest His hand and
lower arm are heavily bandaged

LARRY
- always hated the sight of my
own blood I go out like a light
Anybody elses no problem But
mine you know goes straight
to my head Anyhow this damn
doctors poking around and Im
saying Im going to pass out
and hes saying no youre not no
youre not Next thing I know -

We
CUT BACK TO
JULIA who watches her husband unamused

LARRY
- I wake up On the floor

Gales of laughter at this

And it was him who was looking
sick

BILL
Probably thought youd sue

LARRY
I should do it

EVELYN
Doctors —
LARRY
I know And hes saying Im
sorry Im sorry
BILL
Hes sorry
LARRY

Right
(he has picked up
the brandy bottle)

Only when I laugh

This wins another round of laughter

JULIA walks along the landing while the laughter - muted
by distance - wafts up from below

From the floor above she hears something more

She stops puzzled then starts up the second flight
of stairs towards the Torture Room

INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

She approaches the Torture Room and steps inside

INT TORTURE ROOM NIGHT

The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here
its barely audible But there is another sound a
ifting sound in the corner of the room

ig)

She reaches for the light switch and turns it on
The bulbs been broken however She stares around
the room trying to make sense of the shadows

Nervously she approaches the wall on which four
streaks of light from the window fall Now she
looks towards the window and realizes that the
newspaper has been torn as if by four fingers Her
breath catches Suddenly shes afraid

She stands absolutely still eyes wide in the gloom

JULIA
Whos there

On the far side of the room a movement in the shadows

JULIA almost retreats but something keeps her staring
into the murk as something - the remnants of a human
form made of twisted blistered strands of flesh
raises its head Its squatting against the wall
unable to lift itself into a standing position Its
eyes however have life in them and hunger This
though hes unrecognizable is FRANK

FRANK
(a pained whisper)
Julia
JULIA
Oh my God
FRANK

that theres somebody ahead of her in the darkness
She stops From the floor above a soft sigh

KIRSTY

JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned
light splashing up the stair wellThe effect recalls
her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK The light

makes her look strange ominous

KIRSTY
Oh its you

JULIA doesnt smile

INT PIZZA RESTAURANT DAY

The din of a lunchtime restaurant with all the tables
full and everyone hungry In the middle of the
melee KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things

at once Somebody wants their order taken somebody
else wants more lager somebody else is complaining
Shes doing her best but losing the battle She
serves a table with their food and then starts back
to pick up another order As she does so shes
harangued from every side

INT BAR DAY

By contrast a quiet bar Discreet music
clientele Several couples occupy booths

drinkers are at the bar

Amongst them JULIA

Other solitary

Now we see her more closely we realize shes gone to some

considerable effort to make herself
nothing crude about the change it

ravishing Theres

s a subtle transformation

which shows off her considerable beauty She drinks soda

water

She has an admirer Sitting alone
is a middle-aged man by the name of

slightly paunchy individual She glances over at him

eyes dont leave her for a moment
to get the courage to approach her

She looks away and concentrates on
takes out a cigarette fumbling for
trembling slightly She lights the
it and as she does so she seems to

at one of the tables
PRUDHOE a nervous
His
Hes trying his best

her drink Now she
it Her hands are

make up her mind that

shes not the equal of it She stubs the cigarette out

puts cash on the bar for her drinks
Suddenly PRUDHOEs at her side

PRUDHOE
Not much fun is it

JULIA

and gets up to leave

a well-dressed

Continued

PRUDHOE
Drinking alone

JULIA
Not much

PRUDHOE
I wonder maybe

Hes so nervous he can barely speak

» as were both on our own
we could have one drink together

JULIA looks at him He seems to almost be offering
himself to her Theres a long pause while she tries
to make up her mind Then

JULIA
Why not

She smiles The smile works wonders PRUDHOEs nerves
diminish somewhat JULIAs simply increase now that
shes committed herself Again she opens the pack of
cigarettes as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over

PRUDHOE
(to Julia)
What are you drinking

JULIA
Just soda

PRUDHOE
Plain soda

JULIA
Please

PRUDHOE

I try not to drink at lunch-

at him)

Continued

PRUDHOE
Oh

He stares at her not certain he interprets her correctly

She stares back Then the tiniest of smiles which he
- scarcely believing his luck - returns

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

The CAMERA moves across the room We can hear FRANKs
ragged breathing and as we move in we see on the floor
beside him the box - the Lament Configuration - its

sides gleaming FRANK still squatting on the floor

taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers

Then voices outside JULIA laughs

He raises his head

EXT DOORSTEP DAY

JULIA opens the front door She is still very nervous
fumbling with the keys PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her

the alcohol hes drunk He kisses her She presses him off
her

her breast)

72 INT TORTUPE ROOM DAY

FRANKs view from the corner of the room We hear the
sound of JULIA and PRUDHOEs approach up the stairs

PRUDHOE
This your place

JULIA
Lets not talk about it

PRUDHOE
No personal details right

JULIA
Right

PRUDHOE
You know youre incredible -

JULIA opens the door

JULIA

She steps inside PRUDHOE does as hes instructed He
stares at the bare floor as JULIA closes the door behind
him

PRUDHOE
Theres no bed

JULIA
Thats right

PRUDHOE
Huh

JULIA
I prefer the floor

PRUDHOE
First time for everything right

JULIA
Right

JULIA moves towards him

JULIA
Why dont you take off your jacket
Youre warm

PRUDHOE
Yeah why dont I

She slips the knot of his tie We can hear her pulse on
the soundtrack She glances over PRUDHOEs shoulder He
follows her gaze but she diverts him with a peck on the
cheek

PRUDHOE
(takes over his
undressing)
Why dont you do the same

JULIA
Maybe I will

PRUDHOE now starts to shed his jacket and trousers trying
not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant

We watch from FRANKS POV as he drops his underwear
He still wears his shirt which he starts to unbutton
We move back into a tighter shot

PRUDHOE
(voice slightly slurred)
You know youre very beautiful

JULIA
Am I

PRUDHOE
You know you are lLoveliest
woman I ever set eyes on
JULIA smiles

PRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt

PRUDHOE
Oh Christ

72 Continued
JULIA
Whats wrong
PRUDHOE
Too much drink Better empty

my bladder
She steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door

PRUDHOE
Ill be a moment

As he moves to the door she throws a piece of cloth off
a hammer which lies beside the wall PRUDHOE takes
hold of the door handle Turns it its stuck

PRUDHOE
The doors stuc

Before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head
He doesnt fall but the blow sends blood down the back
of his shirt To avoid the following blow he stumbles
blindly towards the wall but JULIAs not going to be
stopped now He holds the back of his head - dazed
apologetic pitiful - while she moves towards him

PRUDHOE

Dont I please

Im sorry
She eclipses him
» Im so sorry
She raises the hammer
» I dont understand
She strikes him He slides down the wall his jaw

broken blood pouring from his face He twitches Then
the twitches stop

She drops the hammer and stares down at the corpse

JULIA
Enough
The room sighs In the corner FRANKs shadowy form
leans forward
FRANK

Dont look at me

Continued
JULIA backs towards the door as the broken skeletal

form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance

INT UPPER LANDING DAY

JULIA steps out onto the landing and leans against the
wall waves of sheer relief breaking over her

In the room behind her terrible sounds of feeding

INT BATHROOM DAY

JULIA steps into the bathroom and looks at herself in
the mirror Blood is spattered on her face her hands
are similarly stained She is trembling from head to
foot

Stripping off her blouse and flinging it over the side
of the bath she douses her face neck and breasts with
cold water Then she stares up at her face again

examining it She can scarcely believe what shes done

INT LOWER LANDING DAY

She crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the
Torture Room

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

She opens the door

As she does so FRANK retreats into the shadows We are
granted a fleeting glimpse of him his body fuller than
before but still horribly vulnerable

JULIA looks at PRUDHOEs corpse A trail of blood leads
away from it into the darkness The body itself is a
grotesquely misshapen husk now the muscle and fat
withered the eyes sunk into the skull the lips drawn
back to expose the gums A ghostly sight

JULIA
Jesus Christ

JULIA looks across at FRANK who is no longer sitting
but standing in the shadows

FRANK
(his voice stronger)
Do I disgust you

Continued

She doesnt reply

He stretches his arm into a passage of light His flesh
glistens and pulses
FRANK
See Its making me whole
again

He turns his arm over for her appreciation
Every drop of blood you spill
puts more flesh on my bones
And we both want that dont
we

She nods

Good Come here

She stares unable to move

Come here damn you I want
to touch you

Still she doesnt move

FRANK
(more softly)
Come to Daddy I only want to
touch
She takes a step towards his outstretched arm His

fingers touch her face She steels herself against them
Now he starts to trace the line of her jaw stroking

her Now her lips caressingly

Suddenly a sound from downstairs The front door is

opened
LARRY
(from below)
Sweetheart
JULIA withdraws from his touch
LARRY

corpse

INT HALLWAY DAY

LARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs

LARRY
Are you there

For a moment it looks as though hes going to climb the

stairs then he thinks better of it and goes through
to the back of the house

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

JULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes
and is now lifting it The body is lighter now having
been drained of nourishment Its head lolls back and its
dentures drop out hitting the floor loudly She freezes
No sound from below She backs out of the room with her
burden

FRANKs arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at
them

FRANK
Whos a pretty boy then

Soft laughter from the darkness

INT JUNK ROOM DAY

JULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room which is on the
upper landing open Inside a chaos of tea-chests and
bric-a-brac She lays the body down

Continued
JULIA
Ill be down in a minute
LARRY

She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and
stairs Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to
erase the signs of panic She puts a comb through her
hair and adjusts her blouse That done she unbolts the
door and steps out into the landing She doesnt go down
however but up back to the Torture Room

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

She opens the door

JULIA
(very softly)
Frank

A crunching sound in the shadows FRANKs hand opens
dropping the pieces of PRUDHOEs dentures which he has
crushed onto the floor in a rain of plastic teeth

FRANK
Im hurting
JULIA
Hurting
FRANK
My nerves are beginning

to work again

JULIA

JULIA
Just a moment Put on some
music will you babe

LARRY
OK

She returns to her conversation with FRANK

FRANK
Poor Larry Obedient as ever

JULIA
Keep your voice down

She crosses to close the door When she turns round
hes in front of her silhouetted against the window
his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom Suddenly
he reaches out and catches hold of her arm She gasps
in pain

FRANK
Ssh Dont want babe to hear

JULIA
Youre hurting

FRANK
You wont cheat me will you
Youll stay with me Help me
Then we can be together the
way we were before We belong
to each other now for better
or worse

He lets go of her
like love Only real

She goes to the door and leaves him locking it behind
her

We move close to FRANKs face He licks his skinned
lips with a bloody tongue Thunder rolls

KIRSTYS DREAM
The thunder carries over to a dream

We are in the Dining Room of Number 55 except that
everything is once more shrounded in sheets

We CUT to KIRSTY moving through the room her face pale
her hair glued to her forehead with sweat

Somewhere a bell is ringing Flies buzz On the
dinner table a form is covered in a sheet Its clear
that the shape is human She reaches the table and
looks at the body

Suddenly blood begins to seep through the shroud beginning

at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the
body There are sobs beneath the shroud

She reaches for it to snatch it off the body
The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet
She pulls

We glimpse only a moment of whatd beneath a naked
body scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot

She screams
Her scream becomes louder as we
CUT TO

INT KIRSTYS ROOM NIGHT

STEVE sits bolt upright in bed while KIRSTY yells

The sheet is snatched off him He looks across the room
to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed with the sheet in
her hand

STEVE

KIRSTYs eyes are still closed
Kirsty

Her eyes open She looks down at the sheet shes snatched
from the bed and drops it in horror

a cigarette

JULIA
Then you tell me you

explain what happened to you

FRANK
Of course

INT TORTURE ROOM DAY

We pan across the walls as FRANK speaks

FRANK (0OS)
I wanted access to experiences
pleasures that only they
could offer

JULIA (0OS)

The Cenobites

FRANK
Thats what they call themselves
Theyre not human Maybe they
were once but theyre not now
They rearrange their own flesh
for pleasure

Weve moved across to FRANK now He is dressed

in loose fitting jacket and trousers through which
his blood is seeping He smokes taking great
pleasure in the experience

JULIA
And the box

FRANK picks up the box Vague tantalizing forms
move over the surface like ghosts

FRANK
It cost me a fortune All I
had Its a puzzle you see
You solve it and the Cenobites
come through

Continued

JULIA
Where from

FRANK
God knows Sometimes I think
theyre just behind the walls

He turns the box over The lacquer catches the light

JULIA
So they cheated you

In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving Its
difficult to be sure what the forms signify Is
this torture or some elaborate pleasure

FRANK
Oh no They kept to their
bargain They gave me
experiences Id never forget

The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer and
they are appalling Flesh torn open blood running
across sweating flesh hooks and terrible machines

FRANK
But their pleasure was my pain

His voice has begun to tremble The images in the
box are more horrific by the moment And flowing
between them highly distorted the CENOBITEs

faces and that of FRANK screaming and screaming

FRANK
Terrible pain Appalling

He cant speak for a moment After a pause he goes
on his voice heavy

My body was forfeit But my
spirit they left that here
In the boards In the walls
Watching the world but never
able to touch it

JULIA
And the blood let you out

FRANK
There are ways to resurrection
Bloods one of them I wont
let them take me back Julia

JULIA looks at the horrors in the box and understands
his desire

101 Continued

FRANK

I want to be whole and then

get out -

I wont let them take me

JULIA glances into the shadows of the room She
senses FRANKs presence

LARRY
» Oh babe

He starts to unbutton her dress Shes distracted
by her suspicions he has his hands against her
almost before she realizes whats happening

We have her POV as she looks around the room The
dressing table the wardrobe the curtains at the
window Does something move in the shadows

A flash of lightning No Theres nothing

LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him
kissing her This is not the intense slightly
dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK
but a fumbling slightly foolish exchange LARRY is
so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he
doesnt register the fact that JULIAs attention is
elsewhere

Now we have a POV from the far side of the room of
the two figures on the bed the only sound the thunder
and LARRYs murmured words of seduction which we

can barely make out

LARRY
I love you honey let
me oh God I love you

Neither of them have undressed fully theres just a
tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace
of eroticism from the scene

A CLOSE UP of JULIAs head laid on the pillow shows
just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works eyes
closed JULIA looks down the length of her husbands
body The door of the wardrobe swings open FRANK

is watching She registers horror LARRY is oblivious
to all of this of course

We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making
Now he steps out of the wardrobe JULIA makes a moan
of horror which LARRY takes as enthusiasm

LARRY
Oh baby I love you

From JULIAS POV we see the form of FRANK shamble
towards the lovers

108 Continued
From FRANKS POV we see the lovers on the bed
LARRYs back vunerable JULIA seems to realize what

he intends

JULIA
eee NO

LARRY barely hears her

FRANK is at the very end of the bed now and JULIA
becomes highly agitated

JULIA
No No you mustnt Please
No

LARRY stops his love-making

LARRY
(looks at her)
Huh
JULIA
Please
LARRY

Whats wrong with you

JULIA
(almost sobbing)
Please I cant bear it

LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this He
disengages his arms from around her

JULIAS POV as FRANK retreats
LARRY rolls off JULIA
The wardrobe door closes Click

LARRY
I dont understand you One
moment youre all over me the
next its Dont touch me

He sits on the edge of the bed
I just dont understand

He gets up and leaves the bedroom JULIA remains where
she is We have a shot of the bed and her upon it
from FRANKs end of the room She stares at the
wardrobe Through the crack of the open door FRANK
stares back A flicker of lightning illuminates his
face his skeletal grin

Continued

Softly beneath the assault of the rain on the roof

we hear laughter

INT A SMALL RESTAURANT EVENING

KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together
in an intimate restaurant LARRY has little appetite

to judge by his plate He looks as if

he hasnt slept

for several nights KIRSTY by contrast is sparkling

LARRY
maybe we should never
have come back

KIRSTY
Maybe you should give it some
time
LARRY
I guess
KIRSTY
(skirting her real
feelings)

Shes not like Mom Shes

I dont know moody I thought
that was what you liked about her

LARRY

You dont like her at all do you

The straight-forward question silences
moment She wants to be delicate with
feelings but honest at the same time

KIRSTY
I dont know her Shes so
sealed up

LARRYs face is full of the desire for
KIRSTY tries to offer it

If you love her she must be
worth loving Just give me
some time

LARRY nods a weak smile on his face

LARRY

KIRSTY for a
her fathers

reassurance

She doesnt even want to leave

the house

KIRSTY
Really

109 Continued

LARRY
Its like shes waiting for
something

KIRSTY
What

LARRY

I dont know I dont know
Its beyond me

A silence

LARRY
(hesitant)
Would you maybe call round

sometime Try to make friends

KIRSTY
Sure
LARRY
Maybe all she needs is some
company

The flesh is hanging off his face his eyes bulge
in terror

Seeing KIRSTY he starts towards her Behind him
FRANK his body glistening He catches hold of SYKES
by the neck SYKES shrieks stop The eyes glaze
over The body judders as death claims it Then

This isnt happening

FRANK
I used to tell myself that
Used to try and pretend I was
dreaming all the pain But why
kid yourself Some things have
to be endured Take it from me
And that makes the pleasures so
much sweeter

As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the
pus and bloodstained shirt thats glued to his
abdomen and pulls Theres a flow of fluids
FRANKs head is thrown back and he screams

She slips from beneath his grasp But hes after
her in a moment his hand catching her blouse It
tears His fingers rake her bare skin

She stumbles reaches out for the wall which is
slick with SYKES blood Her hand slides over
it She falls heavily

Roaring FRANK comes in pursuit of her

On the floor in front of KIRSTY the box Its a
poor weapon but its all shes got As he comes
after her again she stands up and delivers a blow
to his head with the box He howls She races for
the door But hes after her He strikes her

As she stumbles away down the path she sees the box
at her feet in a litter of broken glass She picks
it up and continues to run

EXT LODOVICO STREET DAY

A series of shots from KIRSTYS POV as she staggers
along the street The sound-track whines the image
threatens to be eclipsed by darkness People stare

at her as she runs A child points

Finally the CAMERA slows She stands still
A voice off camera

VOICE (OS)
Are you all right

139 Continued

The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of
the speaker A WOMAN comes into view

WOMAN
Do you need any help

As she speaks the picture fades to white

140 KIRSTYS DREAM (PART TWO)

The whiteness continues to fill the screen Distant
incoherent voices are heard and the thump of blood
in the inner ear

Then darkness seeps into the whiteness patterns like
Rorschach inkblots ambiguous yet interpretable as
sexual or horrific imagery With the darkness
soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet
in her first dream fragments of FRANKs previous
dialogue

FRANK
Come to Daddy

KIRSTY
This isnt happening

FRANK
Some things have to be endured

The darkness is filling the screen
take it from me
Now total darkness
Come to Daddy

And suddenly she wakes

141 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

KIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room A NURSE
is at her bedside monitoring her condition

NURSE
Youre awake

She goes to the door

Ill get the doctor

Continued
She exits
KIRSTY tries to sit up Her head hurts badly As she

achieves a sitting position the door opens The
NURSE returns with a DOCTOR

DOCTOR
(approaching the bed)
So youre back with us
KIRSTY
I think so
DOCTOR

How are you feeling

KIRSTY
Tender

DOCTOR
You took quite a beating Do

She looks at him uncertain of where to start

KIRSTY
I want to speak to my father

DOCTOR
(nods)
Of course Well bring you a
telephone

The NURSE exits The DOCTOR brings the box from his
pocket

Maybe thisll jog your memory

He lays it on the bed She stares at it her expression
betraying nothing

I had the Devils own job
getting it out of your hand
Does it ring any bells

She shakes her head

Do you want it left

KIRSTY
Why not

He offers her a reassuring smile

141 Continued
DOCTOR
Chin up Theres no serious

damage And youre safe here

KIRSTY
Um

He leaves the room

over in her hand examining it

142 INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

Downstairs the telephone rings JULIA is very
nervous now desperate even

JULIA

JULIA

FRANK

JULIA

Well we cant just stay here -

FRANK

143 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

KIRSTY is sitting up in bed On the bedside table
a telephone She is now thoroughly engrossed in the
problems of the box Her fingers speed over the
surfaces looking for some way in testing its
strength

Suddenly a click Her face lights up with pleasure
as she slides a part of the box open revealing new
intricacies And to accompany the revelation a
tinkling tune

She smiles Its a musical box

The light beside the bed flickers but she doesnt
notice

The door opens Its the NURSE

NURSE
Comfortable
KIRSTY
(smiles)
Sure
NURSE

Any luck with your father

KIRSTY
(shakes her head)
Hes probably got a meeting
I called a friend of mine Hes
coming is that OK

NURSE
Of course

The NURSE exits As she does go the light flickers again
The box clicks A new facet is revealed

KIRSTY smiles

144 EXT NUMBER 55 NIGHT

The front door closes

145 INT HALLWAY NIGHT

LARRY stands in the hall JULIA comes down the stairs
She looks pale even ill

Continued

LARRY
Whats wrong

JULIA
I dont know where to begin

LARRY
What are you talking about

JULIA
Its better you see for your-
self -

She turns and starts up the stairs He follows

INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

KIRSTY has opened more of the box The tune is more
complex now

Somewhere a bell has started to ring Now she works
the final mechanism of the box The bedside light

flickers and goes out

The bell rings Light pours out of the box She
drops it shocked

The bedside light comes on again
She looks up

In the wall opposite the end of her bed a very narrow
doorway has simply opened in the wall

Leaving the box on the bed she gets up and goes to

the gap As she approaches she hears the distant
rhythmical sob of a baby She stands at the doorway

INT CORRIDOR TO HELL NIGHT

We look back at her a diminutive figure framed against
a shot of light from way way down the corridor

INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

The sobbing goes on KIRSTY stares down the corridor -
which is lit brightly in some places and is absolutely
dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down
it or not

Continued
She glances towards the door of her room from the other

side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital
going about its business Whats to fear

INT CORRIDOR TO HELL NIGHT

She steps into the corridor The walls rise into
darkness on either side of her their surfaces like
the interior of a pyramid pitted with age and
rotting away

She starts towards the sobbing child bare feet on
the impacted earth of the passageway

The sobbing gets louder as she advances her form
disappearing entirely as she passes through the
intermittent darkness

Once she glances back towards the Hospital Room to
reassure herself that its still there It is
though its no more than a sliver of light at the
far end of the passageway

She advances a few more paces The atmosphere is
growing denser smoke thickens the air

Then a light glows at the other end of the corridor
The sound of the sobbing child ceases

She stops walking

Ahead the smoke clears and the light brightens and we
see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space
between the walls It is in silhouette against the
light but we can see enough to know that it resembles
no earthly animal Its vast black limbs hold it
suspended above the corridor clinging to the stone
Its front limbs vestigial by comparison hang down
from beneath its vast head Its tail is curled over
its back

KIRSTYs expression registers this horror THE ENGINEER
moves into the light Its irises narrow to slits

From the tail a vast sting oozing pus - like venom
glides into view

And then -

- it comes at her advancing along the corridor by
bracing its legs against the walls Its breath is a
growl in its belly until it moves into darkness when
all sound from it ceases only to erupt again as it
finds the light

149 Continued
KIRSTY turns and starts to run

It comes after her at speed Darkness light darkness
light roars and silence -

Its jaws spill its thick saliva its eyes gleam

KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor back towards the
safety of the Hospital Room But its very close on her
heels lingering -

As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes

on her

150 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

She flings herself through the door with THE ENGINEERs
breath on her back and turns -

The doorway has gone The wall is sealed She approaches
the wall THE ENGINEER scratches on the other side

Then she realises that the bell is still ringing And
theres a foul smell in the air

She looks around
Shes not alone

Standing across the room from her lit by a strange
phosphorescence that has no visible source are four
extraordinary figures

ey are CENOBITES Each of them is horribly mutilated
y systems of hooks and pins The garments they wear

re elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh
aced through skin in places hooked into bone

HoeoOoH

e leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head
t inch intervals At his side a woman whose neck is
inned open like a vivisection specimen Accompanying
em is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping
ectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points and
fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark
lasses

amr tg OMH

When the lead CENOBITE speaks we recognise the voice as
that of the creature from the beginning of the film

KIRSTY stares in amazement

KIRSTY
Where the hell did you come from

150 Continued

The CENOBITE gestures The box is lying on the bed

CENOBITE
The box you opened it
We came

KIRSTY

Its just a puzzle box

CENOBITE
Its a means to summon us -
its called the Lament Con-
figuration

KIRSTY
Who are you

CENOBITE
Cenobites Explorers in the
further regions of experience
Demons to some Angels to
others

KIRSTY
Well I didnt mean to open
that thing You can go back
wherever you came from

FEMALE CENOBITE
We cant Not alone

At this the creature with the wired open jaw chatters
like a mad monkey

KIRSTY
This isnt for real

CENOBITE
You solved the box We came
Now you must come with us
Taste our pleasures

The chattering CENOBITE steps towards her

KIRSTY
Dont touch me

The door opens Its STEVE

KIRSTYs face floods with relief STEVE does not
register the CENOBITES presence however

KIRSTY
Steve Thank God you came
Continued

STEVE
What happened to you

He steps between the CENOBITES
KIRSTY
These things they want to

He doesnt see us or hear us
We belong to you Kirsty And

KIRSTY

STEVE

KIRSTY
Dont let them take me Steve -

STEVE
I wont let anybody take you

He starts to walk towards her but the creature in the
dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts
the hook to STEVEs neck STEVEs hand moves to the
place he makes a small sound of pain The CENOBITE

takes off its glasses to see its trick better
beneath are sewn shut It pulls a little more on the hook

STEVE winces

FEMALE CENOBITE
If he takes another step we
open his throat

KIRSTY
(to Steve)
Please go Steve

STEVE

KIRSTY
Just go Please Ill be OK

Still puzzled STEVE crosses to the door

STEVE

KIRSTY

FEMALE CENOBITE
Good

CENOBITE
Its time we were away

KIRSTY
(almost crying)
Let me alone will you

CENOBITE
No tears please Its a waste
of good suffering

The chatterer comes for her As it does so desperation
brings a plan to KIRSTYs head

KIRSTY
Wait

He stops

CENOBITE
No time for argument

KIRSTY
You did this before right

CENOBITE
Many times

KIRSTY
To a man called Frank Cotton

FEMALE CENOBITE
Oh yes

KIRSTY

CENOBITE

The sound of THE ENGINEER

We cut bac

CENOBITE

FEMALE CENOBITE
But if you cheat us

CENOBITE
Well tear your soul apart

scratching on the other side
The plaster cracks violently

We hear STEVEs voice and pan back

The door opens

STEVE is t

into the room

KIRSTY and the CENOBITES have gone

creaks wide Lying on the floor in the middle of the
room is a skinned corpse in a tangle of torn clothing
It steams There is blood everywhere That too steams

KIRSTY is revolted She steps away from the door back
down the landing

The bell has begun to ring again distantly and there
is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds -
beating on the other side of the wall

KIRSTY starts down the stairs again

KIRSTY
(mouths)
Oh my God

Everything is slowing down The bells and the thunder
fill the soundtrack

LARRY smiles as KIRSTY moves towards him Tears have
begun to fill her eyes She searches for him His
smile decays as he realizes her objective Her nails
rake his cheek The flesh puckers and tears along the
brow Blood flows The mask of stolen flesh he wears
slips a little and FRANKs twisted features come into
view

JULIA
Frank

KIRSTY screams as FRANK lunges for her The lights in
the hallway flicker and threaten to go out

KIRSTY avoids FRANKs blow but in doing so allows him

to get between her and the front door Shes trapped
His torn face flapping he opens his jacket (the interior
of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the
lining

Suddenly JULIA is behind her gripping hold of her hair

FRANK advances on KIRSTY but in the last moment before
the fatal stab KIRSTY twists avoiding the blow JULIA
shrieks and stumbles forward the knife gleaming as
its buried to the hilt in her side

KIRSTY slips from between them JULIA collapses into
FRANKs arms He holds her up

KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door but FRANK lets
JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY JULIA falls back
against the wall dying KIRSTY retreats to the bottom
of the stairs FRANK follows

Continued

FRANK
Youre not leaving now -

As he follows JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his
sleeve

KIRSTY flees the only route she can upstairs The
house is creaking in every board and rafter now

FRANK turns on JULIA trapping her against the wall

JULIA
Help me Frank For Gods
sake

He puts his hands around her neck and leans towards
her At the last moment she seems to understand that
he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little
life she has left

JULIA
No Frank -

From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon
her

Then she looks away and runs up the stairs

When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANKs arms

INT LOWER LANDING NIGHT

The landing is smoky The lights have taken on a
yellowish tinge The air is full of moans

KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place She tries one
of the doors but its locked She opens another and
the din of birds wings gets louder

INT BIRD ROOM NIGHT

A POV shot lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway
She slams the door in the face of whatevers coming
for her

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

FRANK hears the door slam He drops JULIA to the
ground Shes dead her flesh rotting on her face

FRANK starts to climb the stairs his eyes burning
with hunger

INT LOWER LANDING NIGHT
KIRSTY is cornered From below FRANKs voice
FRANK

Where are you beautiful

KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs as FRANKs
shadow is thrown up on the wall below

INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

KIRSTY is faced with a choice The Torture Room door
is open but the skinned body is in there so instead
she heads for the Junk Room and opens the door

INT JUNK ROOM NIGHT

Moonlight falls through the window illuminating a
chaos of furniture and boxes She crosses to the window
and tries to get it open It wont budge

FRANK
(somewhere below)

Where are you honey

She looks around for a lever to open the window with -

INT LOWER LANDING NIGHT

FRANK reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door
calling for her Then he starts up the last flight of
stairs

FRANK
Come to Daddy

INT JUNK ROOM NIGHT

KIRSTY lifts a cloth off one of the boxes

Staring up from the box is the corpse of PRUDHOE his
eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek

She reels back from the box terrified backing into the
shadows

An arm reaches for her taking hold of her and dragging
her back into darkness as the door opens FRANK stands
on the theshold His breath is thick He shambles
forward but he doesnt see her

Continued

We CUT back to the shadows KIRSTYs eyes are wild
with terror

Back to the door which clicks closed

KIRSTY breaks cover and so does her saviour Its
STEVE He is sweating with terror

KIRSTY
(a whisper)
What are you doing here

STEVE
Got in downstairs Looking
for you Whats going on

She shakes her head STEVE brings the box from his
jacket

STEVE
You forgot something -

She doesnt see what hes produced Shes already
moving to the door She listens

INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

The landing is empty The door of the Junk Room opens
KIRSTY steps out

The house is strangely still The lights swing a little
but otherwise nothing She advances along the
passageway STEVE follows They reach the top of the
stairs in safety

STEVE
(signalled more than
spoken)
Ill go first -

As he speaks FRANK steps out of the Torture Room
knife in hand

Roaring he comes at them both KIRSTY flings herself
out of the path of the knife FRANK swipes at STEVE
who falls backwards down the stairs He cries out
head hitting the stairs as he descends

The box falls from his unconscious hand

FRANK turns on KIRSTY who avoids one slice of the knife
and another but is driven back into the Torture Room

179 INT TORTURE ROOM NIGHT

Hes after her in a flash

She falls beside her fathers body her eyes meeting
its skinned face

KIRSTY
God -

FRANK
Dont cry for him Hes dead
He always was

KIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance
She can be terrorized and pursued no longer Death
looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANKs

horrors
KIRSTY
Go on Kill me I dont care
FRANK
Poor baby
KIRSTY
You bastard -
FRANK
Hush now Its all right
Franks here
KIRSTY
Frank
FRANK

Thats right Are you losing
your mind baby This is Frank
youre talking to Frank

As he speaks the bell begins tolling again FRANK looks
puzzled

FRANK
Whats going on

Light begins to pour through the walls of the room
No

He starts towards the door But hes too late The

CENOBITES are standing in his way He backs off from

them

CENOBITE
Frank -

Continued

KIRSTY
(to Cenobite)
What took you so long

FEMALE CENOBITE
We had to hear it from his own
lips -

FRANK turns on KIRSTY

FRANK
You set me up You bitch
You set me up

The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate
and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK

CENOBITE
(to Kirsty)
This isnt for your eyes

KIRSTY crosses towards the door As she reaches for the
handle she hears FRANK roar behind her She turns He
breaks between the CENOBITES knife in hand but as he

comes within striking distance the air is full of whining
sounds and he stops dead

They have their hooks in him we see In his arms and
legs in his back and sides in his scalp and neck and
temples Hooks attached to countless chains whic
arrest his progress They plough through his flesh as

he strives to reach her But at a gesture from the leader
of the CENOBITES the chains are hauled in He flings

back his head yelling The knife drops from his hand
CENOBITE
(to Kirsty)
Out

She turns back to the door and opens it FRANK is hauled
back towards the centre of the room

FRANK
Bitch

The house is growling from basement to eaves now as
KIRSTY steps onto the landing

INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

Behind her FRANK howls

She looks back

180 Continued

They have him in extremis his body spread-eagled
hooks in a hundred places pulling at his flesh He
fights like a wild animal snarling and cursing They
pull the chains tighter

181 INT TORTURE ROOM NIGHT

A close up of FRANKs face He suddenly stops fighting
He raises his head his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from
beneath a bleeding sweating brow He flicks his

tongue over his bloodied lips

Then -

- he comes apart

182 INT UPPER LANDING NIGHT

The door slams as FRANKs body is torn apart in a welter
of blood and flesh fragments

Something heavy thuds against the door

KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs

183 INT STAIRS NIGHT

As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting half-
lying the house starts to growl as though its foundations
are about to give way STEVEs nose is bleeding and

his face is bruised but hes conscious

KIRSTY
We have to get out of here
Theyll kill us for the fun of
it

STEVE staggers to his feet KIRSTY picks up the box
which is on the lower landing As she picks it up
the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows

FEMALE CENOBITE
Dont leave us yet -

KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands
FEMALE CENOBITE
Weve got such sights to show

you -

KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back
into place

Continued

FEMALE CENOBITE
» dont

Her voice becomes a howl and shes sucked away into
darkness

STEVE
(behind Kirsty)
Jesus Christ

They start down to the half-landing There stands the
CENOBITE in the dark-glasses carrying the hooked rod
he threatened STEVE with in the hospital Again
KIRSTY manipulates the box Again the CENOBITE howls
and is claimed by the darkness

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

They hurry down to the hallway half expecting another
creature to step into their path Dust is falling from
the ceiling and there are cracks opening up in the
walls Any moment surely the whole place will be
destroyed

JULIAs body has gone from the hallway a trail of blood
leads into the dining room

As KIRSTY and STEVE stumble across the hallway they hear
JULIAs voice off-screen an eerie ghostly voice

JULIA
Kirsty

KIRSTY hesitates and looks towards the door of the
dining room

There stands the bride her white dress soaked in blood
her veil covering her face

KIRSTY
Julia

KIRSTY takes a step towards her but as she does so the
veil rises of its own accord and the chattering CENOBITE
is beneath

KIRSTY slams the box closed

The CENOBITE howls and disappears

STEVE heads for the door Turns the handle

As he does so KIRSTY realizes theres one piece of the
box unfinished

Continued

KIRSTY
Dont

Too late He turns the handle The door is flung
open and THE ENGINEER clinging to the sides of the
door swings down into the hallway

STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY The box
falls from KIRSTYs hand The beast moves to bite at
STEVE who scrambles out of the way leaving KIRSTY
in the front line

The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER which now
uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her
its legs still bracing it in the door

She snatches for the box THE ENGINEER its mouth
oozing fluids almost catches her arm

Again she tries This time one of its arms seizes hold
of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws

Behind KIRSTY STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and
flings it in THE ENGINEERs face It momentarily

relaxes its grip on KIRSTY who slides her hand from its
hold and claims the box She now has slime on her fingers
The box defies her manipulations

STEVE
Come on Come on

THE ENGINEER crawls towards them Up above the din
of the roof collapsing Timbers and dust hurtle down

the stairs

KIRSTY
Shit Shit Shit

THE ENGINEER is almost upon her It rears up its saliva
dropping on her

And then miraculously the last piece of the box slots into
place

The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes
THE ENGINEER Howling its complaint it is drawn out
into the darkness beyond the door and disappears

Its voice grows thin and fades

Finally silence

The house is still

KIRSTY gets to her feet STEVE does the same

Continued
Together they move to the door and out onto the

step

EXT DOORSTEP NIGHT

The door slams behind them of its own accord

KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand

There is a slit in it which has not quite closed Light
suddenly pours from it up into KIRSTYs face Her
features are momentarily distorted as if sucked towards
the box From within shrieks bells music

Between the screams FRANKs voice

FRANK
Come to Daddy

She slams the panel shut The distortions cease So
does the din

KIRSTY
(quietly)
Not tonight
A smile crosses her face and she leaves the doorstep
making her way towards the street STEVE gazes at her
then follows

Their figures are erased by the darkness

Somewhere a bell rings as

THE CREDITS ROLL
