As she remembers the moment we see the loving look in RON’S eyes
If anything this now is the moment he has earned through his
chivalry How sad it seemsshe pushes back her tears angry at
herself instead

DONNA
-We grew up believing all that stuff
Ronnie never questioning a thing Nothing
they told us was the truth I even opposed
the demonstrators at first my mother told me
to stay in the dorm not get involved to
study and I wouldn’t get into any trouble
“Stay in the dorm don’t rock the boat
that’s the way everybody from Massapequa is
(laughs) don’t rock the boat play it
safebut there’s a world out there and
it’s bigger than Massapequa of

takes it as a signal to go on

i think
(pause)
I think I may have killed your son that
night I think I was the onehe was coming
a at me And I was scared I was confused
And I raised my rifle three times the
shotsand the body fell in the dune

The SOUNDS of the battle lightly etched in over the Speaker
Haunting him

The face of JAIMIE moving to MR and MRS WILSON mute as if
they knewor really what difference did it ultimately make who
killed their son Their pity their terror is not for themselves

or their boy dead long agobut for RON who’s in agony crying
now

RON

tell you I’ve been afraid for years to come
hereButI’ve lived with this long
enough I can’t live with it anymore I
can’t bring him back Forgive meI want to
live I want to go on with my life I’m
sorry but that’s what happened That’s the

this country We love this country more

than they could ever know We fought for it
we gave our bodies because we loved it and
believed in everything it stood for and

CONVENTION - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN NEW YORK CITY JULY 15 1976

From a very wide shot of the Convention where RON is introduced by
the LOUDSPEAKER we cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of RON as he starts
his address pulling out to reveal his facethe podium the
flagsas he speaks

RON
I am the living death You’re Memorial Day
on wheels I am your Yankee Doodle Dandy
Your John Wayne come home Your Fourth of
July firecracker Exploding in the grave
Twelve years ago when I was 18 years old I
left Massapequa Long Island and joined the
United States MarinesI wanted to serve my
countryI wanted to be a good American
I couldn’t wait to fight my first war and I
went with the others like our fathers before
us with hope in our hearts and dreams of

great victory

Blending into the MUSIC THEME nowof tragedy overcome Of life
renewed

The music is joyous as we can cut to a series of SHOTS of the
Veterans marching down Manhattan streets in their 1984 Welcome Home
Parade -- and the real RON KOVIC as he is now in 1988 -- still
fighting for Truth Justice and the American Way
