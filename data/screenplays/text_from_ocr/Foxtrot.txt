FOXTROT

A screenplay by Samuel Maoz
1 INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR VIEW THROUGH A MOVING VEHICLE
EARLY EVENING

Winter Mud and fog An orange sun peeking from time to
time through the fog View through a side window partly
open A stained window pane Motor of a heavy vehicle
presumably a truck in a monotonous dull rattle A long
drive

QUIET YOUNG MANS VOICE (VO)
Do you know why they suddenly decided
to send me home

ANOTHER MANS VOICE
What do I know Im just the driver

We dont see them just hear their voices against the
passing gloomy landscape

Broken sounds of a piano enter the soundtrack Like dry
tears Like faded childhood pictures a childhood
remembered mainly in longing

Title FOXTROT

2 INTERIOR STAIRWELL EARLY MORNING

Closed view of an apartments doorbell A MAN’s finger
presses it briefly and lets go A sticker in faded
handwriting stuck to the doorbell Feldman Family

3 INTERIOR STAIRWELL TO APARTMENT EARLY MORNING

Were facing the front door A short silence The click
of a key turning and the door opens DAFNA in her
forties in her nightgown Wearing a thrown-on dressing
gown her hair disheveled she stares at us wide-eyed
Then blurrily The color drains from her face her
breathing halting She stares at us like a lost child
MICHAEL 45 gets up from his chair deep within the
living room—but remains frozen and stares at us with the
same stunned look

MANS VOICE
Mrs Feldman

A trickle of blood escapes her nose and she silently
collapses
A MILITARY OFFICER 30 in dress uniform and a SLIGHTLY
OLDER MAN in a starched field uniform jump into both
sides of the frame The officer gets hold of her
collapsing body and the man grabs her head before it hits
the wall They gently set her down on the floor A FEMALE
SOLDIER 20 in khakis joins them and helps steady her
They move quietly in an automatic rhythm without a
word The officer takes her pulse and the man apparently
a doctor puts on a stethoscope Dafna sways on the
border of consciousness and tries to tell him something
but her pupils widen her eyes roll back and she starts
to convulse In an oppressive silence the OFFICER holds
her the female soldier pulls apart the dressing gown and
disinfects the naked thigh with some imbued cotton wool
while the DOCTOR fills a syringe and injects her MICHAEL
stays behind paralyzed and stares at the scene without
being able to move or say a word They take her out of
the frame Michael frozen and silent stays standing
alone in the dining area adjoining the living room next
to an empty chair a cup of coffee and a newspaper

We leave him in a long movement and follow the rest A
corridor The opening to a bedroom Dafna is already
lying on a wide bed Wintry sunlight comes in through the
open window and they move silently between darkness and
light and connect her to a drip and an oxygen mask The
officer leaves the room We follow him back to the living
room He goes to Michael still frozen and stunned stops
in front of him and says

OFFICER
Mr Feldman are you listening to me

Michael doesnt react He briefly stares at the officer
and suddenly stumbles for a split second collapses into
himself but immediately catches himself and regains his
balance

The officer grabs him gently and says quietly

OFFICER
Come Sit down

He supports Michael who sinks down woodenly and sits
The officer examines his scattered look and says

OFFICER
Mr Feldman Im sorry theres no
easy way to tell you that your son
Corporal Jonathan Feldman was killed
in action last night

Michael doesnt react just stares at him with a dazed
look Through the big window behind his head is a long
crane cutting across a dark sky in a slow circle
Silence
Faraway whimpering comes into the soundtrack

In a long movement we leave them go back to the
corridor and pass by the opening to the bedroom Dafna
lies without moving The soldier closes a yellowish
curtain over the window The room turns dusky The
silhouette of the doctor packing his bag on the
background of the vivid splash of light through the
curtain

The whimpering is closer now We turn and approach the
closed door at the end of the corridor A thick opaque
pane Beyond the glass the fuzzy silhouette of a large
dog jumping up and down and rubbing against the length of
the door whimpering and breaking the silence We come
closer to the glass and stop facing the leaping shadow
of the whimpering dog for a long moment

CuT TO BLACK
Title MICHAEL

4A INTERIOR MICHAEL AND DAFNAS APARTMENT MORNING

MICHAELs eye fills the screen The pupil is expanded and
the eye is reddened and moist

DOCTORS VOICE
Follow my finger

The eye moves to the right and left following the blurry
movement of the finger that periodically crosses the
front of the frame

DOCTORS VOICE
Now open your eye wide

The eye opens A narrow powerful beam of light turns on
in it
The eyelid trembles and opens wide The pupil contracts

4B INTERIOR MICHAEL AND DAFNAS APARTMENT MORNING
THE ENTIRE SCENE IN CLOSE-UP OF MICHAEL WE DONT SEE
THE MILITARY TEAM ONLY HEAR THEM

CU of Michael He looks up into the beam of light
Another moment and the light goes out He looks ahead—
shocked miserable and lost—half listening half
disconnected

DOCTORS VOICE
Your blood pressure and pulse are
normal Do you have a heart
condition

Michael shakes his head His look is distracted his eyes
moist
DOCTORS VOICE
Asthma

Shake of the head same stare

DOCTORS VOICE
Epilepsy Dizziness

Same mechanical no movement
DOCTORS VOICE

Im leaving you some pills Here
Michael turns his absent-minded gaze

DOCTORS VOICE
These are tranquilizers Take them
only if you feel physical stress
Tightness of the throat prolonged
ringing in the ears strong headache
Are you sensitive to any drugs

Michael shakes his head

DOCTORS VOICE
So take one at night It will help
you sleep

The doctors hand puts the pills on the table next to
the smartphone the half-finished cup of coffee and the
newspaper with the headline Who Will be the Winner of
Tonights Big Brother Competition

The doctors voice continues throughout
DOCTORS VOICE

Its very important that you drink
lots of water

Michael stares aimlessly and is silent
DOCTORS VOICE
I dont expect you to be able to eat
but you must drink
Is this your cell phone

Michael nods His automatic small movement
The doctors hand picks up the phone

OFFICERS VOICE
Later in the day youll be informed
of the time of the funeral You dont
have to worry about anything of
course A funeral officer will come
here around midday and go over the
procedure with you

FEMALE SOLDIERS VOICE
Here Mr Feldman drink this

Her hand offers him a large glass of water Michael
accepts the glass in a shaky hand takes a small sip and
chokes on it coughing The doctors hand pats him on the
back

DOCTORS VOICE
Deep breath

Michael takes a deep breath A trickle of water drips
from his chin His eyes are teary

OFFICERS VOICE
Mr Feldman would you like us to
inform someone else A brother
sister a friend

Michael shakes his head
OFFICERS VOICE
Maybe have someone come over tohelp

A shake of the head
DOCTORS VOICE
I programmed your phone to beep every
hour This will remind you to drink

The doctors hand gives him the phone Michael takes it
and puts it in

his shirt pocket His gaze unfocused and his movements
mechanical

DOCTORS VOICE
Now try to finish your water

Michaels hand trembles The Doctors hand helps him
bring the glass to his lips

DOCTORS VOICE

Slowly
He helps him steady the glass and drink a few more sips
Michael wants to stop but the doctor doesnt give in

DOCTORS VOICE
Another small effort

His sips are small and painstaking His lips tremble

DOCTORS VOICE
Its now 8 oclock At 9 the phone
will beep then at 10 and so on A
glass of water every hour Make sure
of that

OFFICERS VOICE
Im leaving you a note with a phone
number

His hand extends a note Michael takes the note and
stares at it in an effort to focus
OFFICERS VOICE

Any problem that arises any

question or if you feel the need to

talk to someone dont hesitate to

call This line is open 24 hours a

day

DOCTORS VOICE
Your wife will sleep for 4 to 5
hours I or another doctor will come
and examine her when she wakes up
And dont forget to drink Even if
youre not thirsty

OFFICERS VOICE
So thats it Mr Feldman weregoing
to leave now Are you sure you dont
want us to inform someone from the
family Or from work

The same mechanical dull shake of the head
OFFICERS VOICE
If you change your mind call the
number I left you Theyll help you
inform people

An almost imperceptible nod

OFFICERS VOICE
Our sympathies Mr Feldman
Michael stares and is silent His look is detached and
empty

A few more minutes of footsteps the entrance door closes
with a quiet click Silence Not a sound Just a dull
silence A disturbing oppressive deafening silence

5 INTERIOR MICHAEL AND DAFNAS APARTMENT MORNING

Vertical wide shot from ceiling

MICHAEL surrounded by his silent living room remains
seated—frozen and broken—by a round dining table On the
table lie untidily an iPhone a laptop computer a
newspaper reading glasses a half empty cup of coffee
and pills that the doctor left A long moment

Suddenly he shudders and shakes off his paralysis stands
on his feet and in an almost automatic gesture closes
the laptop folds the newspaper sets the reading glasses
to the left of the laptop and straightens them parallel
to its side puts the cup of coffee to its right doesnt
really know what to do with the pills picks up the
smartphone and shoves it into his shirt pocket stares
absently at the almost straight structure the objects
created sets the box of pills next to the reading
glasses and completes the symmetry

A faraway muffled whimper Michaels eyes focus and his
movement stops

Another broken wail He straightens the chair against the
table and strides slowly between the walls and the
furniture of his apartment We continue to watch him from
the ceiling and follow him to the corridor The confining
walls stretch on either side of him For a moment we feel
that he’s in a labyrinth

He stops on front of Jonathans room His hand grasps the
doorknob with force and he turns it with a slight stiff
tremble A small click and the door opens a little
creaking softly The dog rushes out through the narrow
opening into the corridor It turns and disappears into
the bedroom

Wide view along the corridor It seems to get longer and
longer

Michael remains standing for a moment facing the slightly
open door then closes it silently walks slowly and
stops in front of the bedroom door He turns and
disappears into the room

The corridor is empty Dafnas robe still lies on the
floor
6A INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR ABANDONED SWIMMING POOL AND
BEDROOM MORNING

Muffled sounds A naive melody like something from a
music box Camera move Moss and green algae climb up
cracked and faded blue-tiled walls A row of deserted
shower stands two cement benches the iron skeleton of a
diving board and children playing soccer on the floor of
an empty swimming pool The muffled melody sharpens an
ice cream truck slows and stops by the pools fence

6B

We retreat in a slow crawl

A dropped shoulder A window MICHAELs stooped
silhouette standing at the window

We move away from his silhouette into the bedroom
DAFNAs feet on the bed

We move along her body She sleeps on her belly between
ruffled sheets The dog is curled up beside her his head
on her thigh Her pale face rests on a flowered pillow
Her breathing is quiet

The distant tumult of the childrens voices emphasizes
the silence

The sound of a few footsteps

Michael drops into the front of the frame and his head is
swallowed into his pillow with a choked moan The dog
starts to whimper and run around the bed circling
Michael who is trying to hold back his tears and Dafna
who continues to sleep quietly at his side

Michael sits on the edge of the bed holding his breath
The dog comes to him extends a paw and touches him
Michael gives it a small vicious kick A kind of
momentary sharp and unexplained burst of surprising
violence The dog gives a small yelp of pain and leaves
the room silently Michael stays tensed and silent
Suddenly he slaps himself hard

A soft quiet sigh Dafna stirs in her sleep Michael
looks over to her In one small movement she pulls away
the sheet that covers her She extends a slack hand
scratches a band aid stuck to her thigh—where she was
given a shot—and goes back to sleep peacefully The
bandage is left crumpled and droopy Michael reattaches
it to her thigh with a trembling hand His finger stays
for another moment shaking on the end of the crumpled
bandage He turns and bends forward

Behind him the window and the gloomy sky For a moment
the sun peeks out from between the clouds A direct
harsh morning light stains the curtain The slit of light
cuts the length of his body One part is swallowed in the
darkness of the room the other lit up Just a short

moment and the sun is swallowed up in the clouds Again
the grey gloomy light and again the echoing distant
voices of children emphasize the oppressive feeling

A long nagging beep suddenly cuts through the silence
Michael shivers extends a hand pulls the phone out of
his shirt pocket and looks down The flashing screen
shows 0900 Drink a large glass of water

7A INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN DAY

MICHAELs hand grabs the faucet and turns it His wedding
ring raps lightly on a glass he’s holding Water flows
into it

7B INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN DAY

MICHAEL sips takes a deep breath and makes an effort to
take another sip Tears begin to roll down his face but
he doesnt make a sound He just keeps gulping down the
water—his effort is evident A long minute of forced
drinking and inaudible weeping in a kind of obstinate
inner battle to not break down He sits by a small table
in the corner of the kitchen

His cellphone starts ringing He gives a small start and
lowers his eyes to the screen The word Office flashes
He freezes and doesnt answer After 3 or 4 rings the
phone stops

- A short silence -

All the phones on the home line start ringing Michael
gets up with a start but remains standing helplessly for
an eternity of several rings Then silence again

He turns his gaze A small shelf Cups in a row Their
handles aligned facing the right But one is slightly
off center He straightens it in a small automatic
gesture He looks down and sees theres still some water
left in his glass He picks it up A short beep rings out
from his cellphone He puts down the glass grabs the
phone and looks at the screen The words WHERE ARE
YOU glare at him He picks up the glass again and
drinks the water tensely

He sits down takes the phone and dials

The doorbell sounds He hangs up

VOICE BEHIND THE DOOR
Michael its me

8 INTERIOR APARTMENT ENTRANCE DOOR TO CORRIDOR TO BEDROOM
DAY

MICHAEL opens the door A MAN in his fifties stands in
the doorway looks at him miserably and says

MAN
The army called me an officer who
said he came to see you Michael I
dont know what to say

His voice breaks he hugs Michael and starts crying
Michael remains slack and silent his arms hang his eyes
are dry Now that he can cry tears wont come anymore
View from the corridor The man part hugging part being
supported continues to weep

Michael turns his eyes to the bedroom The door is partly
open Through the narrow opening we see part of a bed
DAFNA is asleep her breathing peaceful We come closer
to her in a slow crawl Her face rests peacefully on the
pillow A strand of hair falls across it

9A INTERIOR APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAY

MICHAELs finger taps the screen of his smartphone
We are in the living room facing his back
He stands facing a large wide window The phone is
against his ear and we hear an announcement

PHONE MESSAGE
Hi this is Alma I cant come to the
phone right now so either text me or
Ill call you back as soon as
possible Bye

We move away revealing the city in the background

He hangs up

At the front of the frame we see the MAN who cried He
sits facing a round dining table his head in his hands
staring forward for another moment then says

MAN
We must tell people

A short silence
Michael stays facing the window and says

MICHAEL
I dont want people here now

Silence again

A snail crawls up the window against the grey city We
see Michael through the window watching the snail as it

goes up and disappears The broken sounds of a piano are
heard again but this time its a childrens xylophone

Gloomy skies are reflected on Michaels face and he says

MICHAEL
Suddenly I had a flashback Im four
years old Im at Sarahs
kindergarten Remember Sarah The
teacher
One day Sarah asked Mom to replace
her at the kindergarten for an hour
And so it happened quite
unexpectedly Sarah suddenly vanishes
and instead I see Mom Mom seats us
down and says shes our teacher now
Can you imagine how I felt So proud

10 INTERIOR KINDERGARTEN DAY FLASHBACK

A group of children A woman in her late twenties speaks
to them but we dont hear her We just approach her in a
long slow camera move

MICHAELs voice continues

MICHAEL (V0)
I was sure she was going to tell
everyone that she was my mother but
she didn’t Nor does she look at me
I’m just like the other kids

Now we come closer to a four year-old boy He looks
upset

MICHAEL (VO)
Shes talking but I no longer listen
to her I just want everyone to know
that shes my mom And then I cant
hold back anymore and I burst out
yelling

9B INTERIOR APARTMENT LIVING ROOM AND BALCONY DAY

MICHAELs eyes fill with tears Suddenly rain falls
flooding the window pane The man apparently his older
BROTHER appears and stands behind him He lays his hand
on Michaels shoulder and says
BROTHER

A beep cuts through the silence Michael pulls the phone
out of his shirt pocket and looks down

The phone vibrates The screen flashes

(a short silence)

His brother (quietly into the pause)

Avigdor gives in and says nothing

12 INTERIOR-EXTERIOR TAXI IN MOTION DAY

12A INTERIOR EXTERIOR

The wet window of a taxi
MICHAELs dull and dry gaze through long drops of rain
running down the window He sits in the back seat The

taxi drives slowly The gloomy grey and splotches of
color of a blurry city smear the glass The picture is
liquid

12B INTERIOR EXTERIOR

The song fades abruptly replaced by the voice of the
announcer from the cabs radio

RADIO ANNOUNCER
It’s 1030 am and these are the
headlines from Voice of Israel

The jingle of the news bulletin

NEWSCASTER
Good morning

his restraint and said

ZION GOLANS VOICE

NEWSCASTER
More headlines An IDF soldier was

The cab driver turns down the radio and says

CAB DRIVER
I liked Zion until I saw he was
shaving his chest hair That episode
really turned me off him Man you
were an officer in the army Whats
all this transvestite thing And all
this talk about the modern man who
uses face cream and is self-aware
That Russian silicon bombshell
Larissa really wants to get him into
bed and he comes out saying he needs
to feel something first And that
actually raises his rating dyou
believe it
This country is going to hell Im
telling you

13A INTERIOR GERIATRIC HOME LOBBY DAY

Side of an armchair worn upholstery MICHAELs
fingertips twiddle a strand of unraveled threads A
small frenetic movement He sits in a heavy depressing
lobby that’s shaped like a wide corridor Corduroy
armchairs in brown and beige Faded plastic flowers in
faded plastic flowerpots The lobby is deserted Just one
old man with a walker shuffling at the far end A dull
thud and the sound of dragging feet A short silence and
again a thud and the dragging A metronome but
frighteningly slow

He lowers his eyes Three old magazines lie on the corner
of the table The top one is open And old ad in the
centerfold A clean-cut fresh-looking ice-cream girl
smiles at him silently

He looks back at the approaching old man who keeps
staring ahead The leg of the walker thuds on the floor
A slipper drags A bony hand Wheezing Strenuous
breaths Michael continues to follow him with his eyes
The old man crosses in front of a picture on the wall
Michael’s gaze stops at the picture A faded yellowed
portrait of Herzl

A womans voice nears Words in Thai A caregiver
talking on a cellphone while pushing an old woman in a
wheelchair crosses in front of Benjamin Zeev Herzl They
turn and disappear

The old man continues to drag his feet moving away

WOMANS VOICE
Mr Feldman

Michaels fingertips pull at the strand of upholstery
threads He starts and raises his eyes An Ethiopian
nurse and a well-groomed old woman

He gets up The old woman smiles with a loving look
He kisses her She sits down He sits next to her
Her bony hand strokes his face

Michael looks at his MOTHER and says

MICHAEL
Mother something terrible has
happened
His voice is dry and his face hard
MICHAEL
I came to tell you that Jonathans
been killed

She continues to smile at him lovingly

Michael comes close to her face and tries to focus her
gaze

MICHAEL
You remember Jonathan dont you

She continues to smile and nods Her smile is a little
detached
Michael doesnt give up He takes her hand and asks her

MICHAEL
Whos Jonathan

MOTHER
Your son The soldier

MICHAEL
Yes So did you understand what I
told you

She nods

Michael lets go of her hand for a moment and straightens
the three magazines scattered on the corner of the table
His face is tight His movement small and tense somewhat
neurotic He gives his mother another strained look and
asks with restrained anger

MICHAEL
What did you understand of I told
you

MOTHER

That Jonathan was killed

She continues to smile and look at him lovingly
She strokes his face with a trembling hand and says

MOTHER
Avigdor
14 INTERIOR KINDERGARTEN DAY FLASHBACK
CU of a BOY bursting out saying
BOY
The teacher is my mom
(silence)

The TEACHERMOM looks at him coldly and says

TEACHERMOM

Go stand in the corner

Her voice is dry Shes not even angry For her he
continues to be a stranger He looks stunned Giggling
The piano starts again He goes to the corner Hurt he
stares at the floor A monotonous beep cuts through the
notes

- Cut -

13B INTERIOR GERIATRIC HOME LOBBY DAY

View of a flashing cellphone screen

“1100 Drink a large glass of water

Wide view of the deserted lobby Michaels mother and her
Ethiopian nurse move away Michael bends over into the
front of the frame The faucet of a water cooler comes
into focus He presses the button and drinks

Dance music from the Twenties begins to echo through the
lobby Michael turns his gaze A wide wooden door Two or
three steps and hes in front of it A small metal sign
Activities Room He pushes the heavy door slightly and
peeps in

13C INTERIOR ACTIVITIES ROOM IN GERIATRIC INSTITUTION
DAY

A wide deserted old-fashioned hall The music echoes
between gloomy walls A playback or an organist playing
Five elderly couples are dancing An old man in a
wheelchair watches them from the side of the room

A tired dancing instructor says monotonously

DANCE INSTRUCTOR

Forward forward to the right stop

Backward backward to the left

stop One two to the right stop

Backward two to the left stop
Her indifferent voice is dull The old couples dance
their movements are automatic A pyramid of simple
Formica chairs in the far corner of the hall Michael
stands in the doorway of the hall and stares in for a
long moment

15 INTERIOR-EXTERIOR MOVING TAXICAB DAY

MICHAEL sits in the back seat He presses the phone to
his ear

ALMA (PHONE MESSAGE)

Hi this is Alma I cant come to the
phone right now so either

He hangs up Looks out The rain is over

A blurry street through the window

Long view on a row of grey buildings and suddenly the
sea

A short moment with the sea then cut

16 INTERIOR APARTMENT ENTRANCE DOOR CORRIDOR-LIVING ROOM
DAY

The door opens and MICHAEL comes in

A WOMAN-CHILD in her thirties head shaved wearing
rebellious jeans stands in the corridor leaning against
the wall She raises her tearful eyes and whispers

WOMAN
Michael

She walks to him and hugs him presses against his body
demanding his embrace There is something obsessive and
blatant in her pressing against him Half-heartedly he
puts a hand on her shoulder Her body shakes with silent
weeping

From the kitchen we hear AVIGDORs quiet voice

AVIGDOR
Probably midday tomorrow
I dont know what time yet

Michael looks away to the part of the living room beyond
the wall

A 70 year-old MAN sits in an armchair His hard face
expressionless

Michael tries to disengage himself gently from the
womans embrace but she presses hard against his body
somewhat forcing herself on him The tattoo of a snake
coils along the back of her neck

Avigdor now stands at the opening of the kitchen the
phone pressed to his ear Michael stares at him Avigdor
shrugs as though saying What could I do and says

AVIGDOR (INTO PHONE)
No he asked that no one comes over
for now

Michael whispers to the woman
MICHAEL

Let me go to your father for a
moment

He tries once again to free himself from her clinging
embrace She keeps pressing against him

He disengages himself in a brutal gesture Their eyes
meet Her breathing is hard Her eyes are still teary
but her gaze is enraged

Michael goes to the man seated in the living room Under
the man’s inspection Michael keeps silent for a moment
and says
MICHAEL
Avram

The man gets up and shakes Michaels hand A firm but
slightly trembling palm His eyes stays dry and hard but
with forced restraint

Michael looks away

A SOLDIER sits on the sofa Skullcap tasseled vest and
second lieutenant bars Yeshiva boy and officer in one
package
OFFICER (GETS UP)
Mr Feldman

Michael nods
OFFICER
Second Lieutenant Israel Schwartz
from the Military Rabbinate

Extends his hand and adds

OFFICER

Michael returns a limp handshake

OFFICER

funeral arrangements
I need to coordinate some details
with you and brief you In private
if possible

MICHAEL
Wait for me in my office this way

Points to the spiral staircase leading to the attic
The funeral officer nods

17 Interior apartment kitchen day

MICHAEL stops for a moment in the kitchen doorway The
kitchen table looks like a small war room AVIGDOR is
bent over a laptop computer talking on the phone

His back is turned to Michael and hes unaware of his
presence

AVIGDOR

18 INTERIOR APARTMENT BATHROOM DAY

A narrow tall toilet A black toilet seat and a small
Bauhaus-style skylight Round soft winter light falls on
a sink and faucet attached to the wall Elongated
porcelain tiles that look like ivory bars

MICHAEL sits on the toilet lid and listens to his phone

ALMAS (PHONE MESSAGE)
Hi this is Alma I cant come to the
phone right now so either text me or
Ill call you back as soon as
possible Bye

A beep

He wants to say something but nothing comes out

He sits speechless for a long moment then finally hangs
up

Silence He feels stuck Doesnt know what to do and how
to continue Suddenly he says to himself

MICHAEL
Jonathan is dead My son is dead
Hes dead

He tries to cry Makes an effort but nothing comes out

MICHAEL
It hurts It hurts that my boy is
dead
(Slaps himself hard)
It hurts
(Another slap)
It hurts

He turns on the faucet puts his hand under the stream of
water and turns the faucet to “warm” The water heats up
and scalds his hand

19 INTERIOR APARTMENT SMALL OFFICE DAY

A framed faded drawing hangs on the wall It shows a
complicated symmetrical impressive structure The
funeral officer stands in front of it his puzzled look
trying to decipher the architectural enigma

Michael comes in the officer nods They sit in two
armchairs like those in a magazine near a tangled
orbital drawing Or an Escher reproduction

Now we also see a period drawing table and a computer
nook next to a round Bauhaus-style window

The OFFICER opens a notebook and says

FUNERAL OFFICER
Before we start Id like to confirm a
few details
Does the deceased have a middle name

MICHAEL
No Just Jonathan Feldman

The funeral officer writes while saying

FUNERAL OFFICER
Staff Sergeant Jonathan
Feld

MICHAEL (INTERRUPTS HIS MUMBLING)
--Hes a corporal not a staff
sergeant

FUNERAL OFFICER
Hes been promoted after his death
Its an privilege bestowed on all
deceased IDF soldiers

Returns to his notebook

FUNERAL OFFICER
Jonathan Feldman son of Michael
and Dafna right

Michael nods The funeral officer writes

FUNERAL OFFICER
(writes )
Michael and Daf

MICHAEL
(Interrupts him again)
But if he was promoted he should be a
sergeant not a staff sergeant

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Thinks for a moment)
Maybe they want to give him a special
honor

MICHAEL
Why Do you know how he died

FUNERAL OFFICER
(suddenly stressed)

(Hurriedly goes back to procedure)

So the funeral is set for three
oclock tomorrow At 1300 the
command car with the coffin will
arrive here I take it you know that
IDF soldiers are buried in coffins

Michael nods

FUNERAL OFFICER
The coffin will be accompanied by an
honor guard of six soldiers

At twenty past one the bus will
arrive to pick up whoever needs a
ride and at one-thirty we start
moving north to the cemetery I1l

lead the convoy with the jeep behind
me the command car with the coffin
then you the family in a van
following the coffin Then the
civilian vehicles and the bus
bringing up the rear

At two we arrive at the cemetery The
coffin wrapped in the Israeli flag
will repose in the communion hall for
forty minutes At a quarter to three
latest well begin the rending
ceremony in which the rabbi will tear
your shirt A small tear near the
heart as written And Jacob rent
his clothes and mourned his son
when they mistakenly thought that
Joseph had died Genesis XXXVII
verse 34 Thats also when youll say
your first Kaddish

At three the funeral procession will
go from the communion hall to the
military plot The coffin borne by
the honor guard in the lead If you
want to bear the coffin you can join
in but I dont recommend it Its
better you support your wife

When we reach the grave well start
the burial ceremony which includes
the interment of the coffin This is
a very difficult moment especially
for the mother For you too of
course But after all you know we
are men

Michael turns his gaze to the entrance to the room (next
to the officer and slightly behind him) the door having
been left partly open

In the gap between the door and the frame stands the dog
Their eyes meet Michael gestures to the dog to come in
The dog stays

The officer raises his voice slightly in order to regain
Michaels attention and continues

Well begin the ceremony with a
three-gun salute then well say He
shall enter into peace We cover the
coffin with soil we say the Tzidduk
HaDin prayer you say your second
Kaddish Then the eulogies

Michael again turns away from the officer and coaxes the
dog to come The dog raises a paw opens the door in a
small movement but stays put

In the background the officers voice

OFFICER
(Continues )
On behalf of the IDF the battalion
commander Jonathans direct
commander and one of his company
mates a guy named

(Thumbs through his notebook pages and
raises his voice)
Danny Weiss You know him

Michael turns his eyes back to him and shakes his head

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Mumbles )
It says here he was Jonathan’s friend
from high school

Again Michael signals to the dog to come to him The dog
takes a hesitant step forward then stops

The funeral officer pauses for a moment then continues

FUNERAL OFFICER
After the eulogies well go on to the
burial prayer O God Full of
Mercy and the third Kaddish

Once again Michael cajoles the dog into coming to him
Maybe he even whispers Come
In the background the officers voice

OFFICER
(Continues )

After which you may eulogize your
son if you wish And then words from
civilians family members teachers
friends

The dog relents and comes nearer but its movements are
hesitant

FUNERAL OFFICER
This is also the time

Suddenly he sees the dog and recoils a little staying
frozen in place tense and silent

The dog puts its head on Michaels knees His movements
are still hesitant yet it looks like a ritual Like a
moment from a familiar ceremony A moment in which
Michael regrets and the dog forgives Michael lays a
gentle hand on the dogs head and strokes it silently
The dog closes its eyes and surrenders to the touch

Michael turns his eyes back to the officer The officer
shakes off his paralysis and continues His voice is a
little tense

FUNERAL OFFICER
This is also the time to do something
special if you wish like read a
poem or tell a story about him—one
that tells something about his
character Something maybe even
something a bit amusing A little
smile you know always helps to cope
and to go on

Michael keeps staring at him with an impervious
unresponsive look
The officer hurriedly concludes

FUNERAL OFFICER
Finally we move on to the laying of
wreaths Two female soldiers will lay
four wreaths the battalions wreath
the brigades wreath the wreath of
his military branch and the IDFs
wreath

Michael is silent A long silence
FUNERAL OFFICER
If you have any questions remarks
requests
Michael still silently stroking the dog
FUNERAL OFFICER
(Tries to get him to speak)
Im here to address any of these

Michael stays silent for a moment then suddenly says

MICHAEL
I want to see him

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Doesnt really understand)
Who

MICHAEL
Jonathan The body

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Stressed)
Mr Feldman thats unnecessary

The dog senses the rising tension and leaves quickly

MICHAEL
(Gets heated)
What do you mean A father wants to
see his son before hes buried
whats unnecessary here

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Stammers )
Im sorry but thats out of my
hands

MICHAEL
(close to exploding)
So whose hands is it in

FUNERAL OFFICER

(Tries to calm him down)
Mr Feldman there are many ways of
saying goodbye You can read
something maybe something he wrote
Or perhaps have us play a song he
loved We can play it we do have a
sound system Or organize a few of
his buddies to sing it You know how
it is theres always the friend with
a guitar

MICHAEL
Do you even have a body

FUNERAL OFFICER
What

MICHAEL
Im asking if theres anything left
of him If therell be a body in the
coffin or if youll put some bricks
in there so that Ill feel like Im
carrying something

His cellphone beeps

The screen flashes
1200 Drink a large glass of
water

20 INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN DAY

Michael makes an effort to drink half a sip Then he
tries to drink a little more but he gives up Hes
exhausted
AVIDGORS VOICE
You look pale

MICHAEL
(In a low voice)
I think they dont have a body

The FUNERAL OFFICER passes the entrance to the kitchen

FUNERAL OFFICER
(Mumbles )
May you never again suffer such
sorrow Mr Feldman

He hurries out

AVIGDOR
What did he tell you

MICHAEL
He refused to let me see the body

On the soundtrack the closing of the entrance door is
heard

AVIGDOR
But he didnt tell you they dont
have a body

Michael is silent He sees the obituary on the laptops
screen

The words Jonathan Feldman of blessed memory
paralyze him

AVIGDOR
(Realizing Michael has seen this)
Dont get stuck on this Michael
Were atheists what does it matter

Michael swallows another small sip of water His gaze
remains glued to the obituary He looks weak and
disturbed

Avigdor glances at Michael turns his eyes to his
computer screen tries to change the subject and says

AVIGDOR
How did it go Did she even get any
of it

MICHAEL

(Returning his glance)
She got every word and didnt
understand a thing

Avigdor seizes the opportunity and presses Esc but his
gesture catches Michaels attention again The obituary
disappears and is replaced by a silly screen saver

a photo of Avigdor smiling and proud between two young
boys who appear to be his sons

AVIGDOR
(While performing his actions)
People want to come over to give you
strength

MICHAEL

(Stifling a burst of anger)
And what will they tell me That I
have their sympathies Theyll talk
to me about what a special kid he
was
Then theyll tell each other how
strong Michael is how he manages to
hang in there and function

AVIGDOR
(Restrains himself over the sarcasm)
Dont insist on going through this
alone This is not another one of
your projects
Silence

MICHAEL
Why does she call me Avigdor

Avigdor is silent
The phone rings

AVIGDOR
Hello

He listens for a moment turns to Michael and asks

AVIGDOR
What was Jonathans Jewish calendar
date of birth

Michael shrugs and is silent

AVIGDOR
Dont you have an ID card of his
somewhere here

21 INTERIOR APARTMENT JONATHANS ROOM DAY

Michael opens a wide drawer

A clutter of things Drawing pencils and crumpled sheets
of paper Doodlings A dried marijuana blossom in a tin
can At the bottom of the drawer a faded Playboy
magazine January 1970 A Playmate with a naive
seductive pose Two black Xs censor her nipples Michael
looks at the magazine His gaze glued to the picture He
is still Just a light tremor almost imperceptible He
averts his eyes An ID card rests in the corner of the
drawer Michael looks at the picture His eyes blur for a
moment and the card slips from his hands He stumbles
grabs hold of the back of the chair regains his
bearings and sits down on Jonathans bed

Cut
Wide view of the room

Michael pulls out his phone and dials

ALMA (PHONE MESSAGE)
Hi this is Alma

He hangs up

His finger flutters across the list of contacts He stops
at Jonathan trembles for a moment then presses

JONATHANS VOICE
Hello this is Jonathan Im at the
end of the world right now and
theres no service here But you can
leave a message and someday Ill
return

He dials again and listens Tears flood his face

The doorbell rings He starts turns his gaze and sees
the ID card he dropped on the bed Jonathans picture
We see him for the first time His face is youthful but
the man inside show through

We come closer to the picture The soundtrack fades out
and dies Empty silence

The voice of a WOMAN screaming

WOMANS VOICE
(Screaming)
Dafna

Michael gets on his feet with halting breath

22 INTERIOR APARTMENT BEDROOM KITCHEN ENTRANCE-
DOOR—LIVING-RooM DAY

A thick opaque pane of glass MICHAELs silhouette
approaches on the other side A small click and he opens
the door to Jonathans room

Facing him the darkened corridor At the end of the
corridor he sees the OFFICER the DOCTOR and the FEMALE
SOLDIER He approaches them and glances toward the
bedroom The woman is bent over at Dafnas side shaking
her He passes Avigdor seated at his war room looking
stunned An eternity of seven or eight steps and Michael
stands facing the three of them

OFFICER
(Forcing a correct distance upon himself)
Mr Feldman there has been a terrible
mistake
The soldier who was killed was named
Jonathan Feldman but he is not your
son Hes another Jonathan Feldman

(Takes a small breath and adds)
You son is alive and well

Michael turns his gaze to the living room The 70 YEAR-
OLD MAN cries quietly

His phone rings On the screen flashes the word Alma
He turns to the living room walks over to the large
wide window stops in front of it presses the phone to
his ear and says

MICHAEL
Alma

His voice is quiet his face peaceful

ALMAS VOICE
Hi Dad You were looking for me

The piano plays
The sun comes out from between the clouds It blinds him
and he closes his eyes

23 INTERIOR BATHROOM

A paper boat floats in a bathtub A drop of water falls
and creates soft spreading circles A SMALL BOY Facing
him a LITTLE GIRL Their faces in the water and their
crouching bodies immobile

A moment of nothing Just a random drip Together they
pull their heads out of the water and take a long breath
that turns into rolling laughter

24 INTERIOR APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAY

CU of MICHAEL lying on the floor with moist staring
eyes The laughter echoes into silence His head rolls to
the side He exhales and a tear slides down his cheek

He sees the living room from floor level A crumpled rug
and the leg of a table

His cellphone lies at his side and beeps

1300 Drink a large glass of water

The doctor bends over him His eyes are worried At his
side stand the OFFICER and AVIGDOR

DOCTOR
Keep lying down and tell me if
something hurts

Michael just stares at him with a stunned look

DOCTOR
Move your feet your fingers

MICHAEL
(Stunned)
What happened

DOCTOR
You fainted

Michael remains stunned for a moment then he suddenly
jumps up and shouts

MICHAEL
Wheres Jonathan

He tries to get on his feet but gets dizzy

The doctor and the officer grab him and seat him gently
on the sofa

DOCTOR
(While performing his actions)
Take it slow Mr Feldman
Everythings fine with Jonathan
Come sit on the sofa

Michael looks confused and upset

Avigdor picks up the cellphone from the floor and puts it
on the table opposite Michael Michael extends a hand
and straightens it along the edge of the table in a
small automatic gesture

DAFNAS SISTER
(Off camera from bedroom)
Get up Dafna Jonathans alive
(Her voice is excited and full of joy)
Its not he who died Its someone
else
OFFICER
(Cant hide his smile)
Jonathan is alive Mr Feldman And he
has no idea

MICHAEL
(Interrupts him)
So where is he

OFFICER
At his unit And he has no idea of
all that happened

MICHAEL
I want to see him

OFFICER
Well take care of it Im sure that
tomorrow or the next

MICHAEL
(Gets to his feet interrupts him and
bursts out)
I want my son returned to me now

DOCTOR
(Stressed)
Calm down Mr Feldman Sit down

Tries to make him sit
Michael shakes him off with a forceful movement and says

MICHAEL
Dont touch me

The doctor recoils

AVIGDOR
Whats wrong with you Michael Calm
down

MICHAEL
Ill calm down when they return my
boy to me
(To the officer)
You killed him You led me to believe
you didnt even have a body

OFFICER
Who told you such a thing

AVIGDOR
What does it matter now Michael
Hes alive
Thats it its over

Extends his hand again and tries to hug him

MICHAEL
(Disengages from his embrace)
Why are you so sure Because they
told you First they told me he was
dead Now they tell me hes alive
Who are they anyway They cant
even tell me where he is

OFFICER
I told you Mr Feldman Hes with his
unit

MICHAEL

I didnt ask who hes with I asked
where he is

DOCTOR
(Slightly raises his voice)
Mr Feldman listen to me Youre
having an anxiety attack

MICHAEL
(Cuts in)
No You listen to me You made a
mistake

OFFICER

(Cuts in)
The system made a mistake Mr
Feldman It wasnt us personally
Your son’s in the Seam Zone holding
a supply axis Nothing operational
just a roadblock on some side road

The female soldier hands Michael a glass of water and
says
FEMALE SOLDIER
Here Mr Feldman drink this

Michael takes the glass in a trembling hand and sips His
sips are erratic
AVIGDOR (MUMBLES)
Everythings fine Michael Drink up
Calm down

Michael hurls the glass to the floor where it shatters

MICHAEL
(Shouts)
Will you stop telling me to calm
down Im calmer than you are

Silence Everyone freezes

DAFNAS VOICE
Michael

He looks toward her
She stands in the living room doorway wearing her
nightgown and mumbles

DAFNA
Its not Jonathan its someone else

Her eyes are moist and her smile euphoric

Her sister stands slightly behind her Her father goes
over to her and hugs her

Dafna keeps smiling and mumbles

DAFNA
They made a mistake Dad Its
someone else

Avigdor puts his hand on Michaels shoulder and says

AVIDGOR
Everythings fine Michael You see

Michael shrugs him off Avigdor recoils

Dafna frees herself from her father goes to Michael
strokes his face and says

DAFNA
Thats it its over
Our Jonathan is alive

He looks at her a tear rolls down his face He appears
lost and confused She gently seats him down on the sofa
He sits She sits next to him strokes his face smiles
and says

DAFNA
Its not he who died its someone
else
Her smile is happy
OFFICER

(With some relief)
You son is fine You have no more
reason to worry

MICHAEL
(Becomes angry once again)
Where did you say he was

OFFICER
At a roadblock in the Seam Zone
holding a supply axis there

MICHAEL
(Still heated but controlling himself)
And this Seam Zone where is it

OFFICER
(Stammering a little)
Near the border It crosses a dead
area in the northern sector

MICHAEL
A location Give me a location

OFFICER

(Loses his cool for a moment)
Im not a field officer Im not
supposed to point out the specific
location

(Immediately pulls himself together)
But Ill immediately get things
moving so that your son will come
home as soon

MICHAEL

(Interrupts him)
You mean you havent started dealing
with that yet

OFFICER
(Restrains himself and repeats)
Mr Feldman your son will return home
as soon as possible

MICHAEL
(Flares up)
And when is this As soon as
possible Because your dead area and
your Seam Zone and all your military
mumbo-jumbo is after all no more
than a few hours from here

AVIGDOR
But he cant just stop everything and
bring Jonathan here immediately

MICHAEL
(Bursts out at him)
Stop what Tell me are you on his
side or mine

AVIGDOR
(Taken aback)
Im with you Michael
(Again puts a hesitant hand on Michaels
shoulder)
I just want

MICHAEL
(Shakes him off rudely)
Will you stop touching me Why are
you touching me all the time

Avigdor backs off

Again Dafna tries to stroke Michaels face but he shakes
her off

Dafna lets go but stays close

A short silence

Dafnas sister approaches lays a gentle hand on
Michaels arm and say almost in a whisper

DAFNAS SISTER
Youre so right Michael

DAFNA

(Barks at her)
Dont interfere
(Gives her a look)

She retreats somewhat

DOCTOR
(In a calming voice)
Mr Feldman youre experiencing an
anxiety attack

DAFNAS SISTER
It doesnt mean hes not right

DAFNA
Shut your mouth

Avram (the father) lowers his eyes A short embarrassed
silence

DOCTOR
(Tries again)
Let me give you a tranquilizer shot

MICHAEL
So you can drug me like you drugged
my wife

(To Dafna)
Youre still under the influence
Thats why youre so euphoric

DAFNA
(Strokes him)

I know youve been through lots of
things Even if you dont talk to me
about them

(Whispers to him)
Dont let the demon continue
Michael This isnt you now Its the
demon

Michael grabs her arm takes her stroking hand off him
and hisses at her in a low voice

MICHAEL
Why are you talking to me as though I
were crazy Are you with them too

DAFNA
(Almost begging)
Youre always sorry in the end
Michael

Michaels eyes take on a dull look

DAFNA
Dont disconnect now
(She shakes him)
Whats important now is that our
Jonathans alive Please give it up
this time for me

He removes her hand again as she tries to touch and
stroke him but she presses against him and says

DAFNA
Lets tell everyone to leave Well
stay together alone order in some
food pizza or a cheeseburger with
champagne Lets get drunk

Michael shakes her off roughly and says

MICHAEL
Youre drugged Dafna Youre not
yourself They woke you too soon

He makes a effort to restrain his voice turns to the
officer and says

MICHAEL
I demand that you take responsibility
and bring back my boy Not tomorrow
No Well see what we can do Now
Thats the least the army should do

(Turns to the doctor)
The fact that Im anxious doesnt
mean Im not reasonable For five
hours my boy was dead Suddenly hes
alive but you dont really know
where he is So whats so
unreasonable about what Im demanding
here Tell me whats not reasonable

They are silent Dead silent

Michael looks at them for another moment then walks to
the entrance door and mumbles

MICHAEL
Why am I wasting my time on you

(Opens the door and says)
Get out please

OFFICER
Im sorry you feel this way but I
dont judge you not in your state

DOCTOR
(Whispers to Avigdor on his way out)
Hes in a psychotic state Keep an
eye on him

They leave

Michael puts the earphone onto his ear and searches
through his cellphone muttering

MICHAEL
Psychotic state yeah right
Bunch of impotents Losers Nobodies

Running footsteps approach from the stairwell The door
opens and Alma enters in a storm

ALMA
(Panting)
Whats happened Dad Why didnt you
answer I just saw soldiers Is
Jonathan okay
(Starts crying)
Michael hugs her and says

MICHAEL
Everythings okay Alma Im bringing
Jonathan back Im bringing him back
home Now

He presses one of the numbers on his smartphone and
waits
He continues to hug Alma as he speaks into the earpiece

MICHAEL
Eitan its Michael I need a favor
urgently You said you have a friend
whos a general in the army Shmulik-
something someone who has influence
who can solve any problem with one
phone call

(Listens)
Okay so this morning the army
announced to me that Jonathan my
son

- Brutal cut that interrupts Michael in mid-word -

25 EXTERIOR ROAD AND MUD LATE AFTERNOON

A dark sky over an expanse of fog and mud A narrow road
extends across the mire a road no wider than a truck
that rises from the mud and is swallowed by the fog

TWO SOLDIERS next to each other One is sitting on the
burned melted seat of a car The other is standing in a
concrete gunners post next to a heavy machine gun
Silence Just a click And another click In metronomic
rhythm coming nearer A skinny cow enters the frame in a
monotone gait crosses it and leaves

Her steps moving away

Again we are left with the two soldiers They are staring
forward at a distant point We dont see what they are
looking at but its clear that they’re focusing on
something

A long look a deep silence only the whisper of muffled
wind

Title on picture
Three days before

Suddenly the soldier sitting on the burnt car seat says

SOLDIER ON SEAT
Did you know that the foxtrot is a
dance
Silence
The soldier gets to his feet stands in front of the
other soldier and his heavy machine gun and says

SOLDIER

The step of the foxtrot is look

(Takes a step forward)
Forward

(Takes another step forward)
Forward

(Half a step sideways then a quick stop)
To the right and stop

(Demonstrates again)
Backward backward to the left and
stop

Grasps his gun like he’s holding a woman and starts
dancing silently on the road The soldier with the
machine gun is his audience

A long minute A soldier dancing the foxtrot with his gun
against a background of endless mud

CuT TO BLACK

Title Jonathan

26 EXTERIOR MOSTLY MUD LATE AFTERNOON

The camera slowly moves down to the mud then floats
above it The dark sky reflects on small patches of
water like scattered pieces of a puzzle Deep silence
Only the muffled whistling of the wind A long floating
camera move The mud begins to lose its viscosity It
becomes watery and thin and more and more parts of the
sky are added to the reflected picture until the swamp
turns into a puddle In the middle of the puddle we see
the reflection of a strange structure The floating
movement stops

We move up from the puddle until we face the structure
that looks like a concrete cube One of its sides is sunk
in the mud and it lists diagonally in a disturbing way
There are no windows just a rusted iron door along the
leaning side

A bit behind the structure rises a tall narrow tower
an observation platform with a tarpaulin ceiling The
tarp is billowing in the wind like a sail and for a
moment it seems the tower is the mast of a ship in a sea
of mud and the leaning structure its command bridge

The iron door rolls sideways in a creaking of wheels
Four figures come out of the structure Theyre far away
but we can recognize them as soldiers One of them turns
to the tower and the other three cross the puddle and
come toward us in the direction of the road The mud is
soft and boggy and with effort they drag themselves
along

The lone soldier arrives at the tower and climbs the
steps but we focus on the other three The camera soars
upward and we view them from above vertically A
godlike view A view that turns them into pawns on a
chessboard of mud that makes their walking directionless
and our point of view detached cold even a bit
condescending We will stay with this point of view for
the time being

Their slog ends and after a long minute the three
soldiers reach the road

The soldier in a concrete gunners post dismantles the
machine gun Above him is a ragged striped beach
umbrella faded blue and stained white Another soldier
comes out from the carcass of an ice cream truck The

picture of a laughing ice cream girl under layers of rust
and green scum We can now see metal barrels rolls of
razor ribbon and a spike strip on the road A weird
roadblock in the middle of the muddy wilderness

The soldiers who reached the road split up One relieves
the soldier with the machine gun The other two soldiers
on duty are also relieved Their movements are mechanical
and we observe from above the silent changing of the
guard

The soldiers who were replaced leave From above we
observe the three replacements These soldiers along
with the one in the tower make up section 1

Section 2 the one that was relieved isnt really
important to us and will exist only in the background

The commander of section 1(COMMANDER) stands by the ice
cream truck raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes and
scans the mud spread out beyond the other side of the
road

Amikam the one at the gun post also lifts binoculars to
his eyes and scans around Jonathan goes to a utility
pole opens the control box and lifts the switch The
light goes on A muddy flickery light A misty halo of
condensation flickers in the air He sits down on the
burnt car seat and like his two comrades presses a pair
of binoculars to his face

A long movement toward what they’re looking at No
hills just a flat plain of endless mud a film of fog in
the air and the huge concrete and iron remains of an
enclosed abandoned industrial area Torn tin vats
shattered smokestacks and broken hangars that from our
viewpoint resemble a gigantic ship a moment before its
final drowning Its stern sunk and its bow bursting out
from the heart of the mud

Evening slips onto the mud
Cut

27 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DESERTED SITE NIGHT

Nagging rain

A pair of army boots in a small puddle by the side of the
road Clinging mud oozes down the boot A shabby plastic
sheet wrapped around a huddled figure The drops run down
it Through it we see stained army pants with knees drawn
together a worn notebook held between unraveling woolen
gloves and fingers grasping a fountain pen Huddled on
the burnt car seat JONATHAN is writing maybe doodling
Hes 18 and his face is boyish but the man in him is
beginning to bud

He raises his eyes and looks at the silhouette of the
deserted site that lies dark and silent amid the mud
spreading before him He searches for something unknown
and then returns to his notebook

Suddenly his gaze sharpens He registers a blurry
movement

For a moment the deserted site lies dark and silent when
suddenly appears the short glimmer of a flashlight from
one of the sides of the complex

He raises his binoculars and sees the dim silhouette of a
cavernous hangar

AMIKAM tenses and embraces the machine gun

COMMANDER comes in from the darkness and all three
silently observe the deserted site

The sound of an electrical buzz in the air and suddenly a
bright round circle of light falls on the three of them
like a spotlight on a theater stage It darts to the far
end of the mud smears over the hangar wall and wanders
between smashed windows and darkened rooms A short flash
from one of the rooms The spotlight darts to the window
and floods the room with bright light A wall stained
with damp and scum A rotting leather armchair and a
standing lamp with a crumbling canvas lampshade

A radio-like voice suddenly echoes in the air

VOICE
You have entered a military zone
Please stop before the roadblock

28 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

Wide view The circle of light (somewhat theatrical) now
accompanies a grey private car It drives on the narrow
road nears the roadblock slows down and stops

The message still echoes

29 EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) TOWER NIGHT

A cassette stops playing

A switch marked PLAY releases and the message is cut off
A hand grasps a heavy handle and pushes It budges

A faint creak

The figure of RAPHAEL against the huge light that
continues to blind us A moment later it then fades and
goes out We can now see a pair of enormous loudspeakers
atop the tower

30 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

The headlights of the car go off as does the motor

JONATHAN turns on a flashlight and lights up the
windshield

A MAN in his fifties suit balding head well-groomed
mustache

Hes dazzled and submissively lowers his eyes a bit

At his side sits a woman of his age presumably his wife
Her eyes are already lowered

A well-groomed middle-class couple

The COMMANDER goes to the drivers door The window opens
and the man hands him documents The commander looks at
the mans picture directs the flashlight to his face
and compares the two Then he looks at the womans
picture She looks at least fifteen years younger there
He lights her face and studies her profile Her skin is
already a little wrinkled her gaze submissive and still
A long look then he turns gets into the ice cream
truck and disappears

Jonathan goes to the back of the car and checks the
trunk

A spare tire a safety triangle a toolbox a used
blanket and a jerry can

What you’d expect to find in the trunk of a car

31 EXTERIOR-INTERIOR INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK NIGHT

A worn keyboard Fingers type Their movement is clumsy
The face of the driver on a stained square screen that
flickers in saturated color

The ceiling drips The COMMANDER sits on a threadbare
chair bends over the sales counter across from an
ancient monitor and types

Hes 21 years old his moist face is tired but his look
focused

A prickly beard worn horn-rimmed glasses dripping hair
On the moist rusty tin sheet behind him rest the remains
of a painted image an ice cream cone with two flavors
punch and banana

At his side on a disintegrating ice cream freezer sits
a massive radio Its side panel has been removed and a
tangle of wires gush out

The radio murmurs A disturbing electromagnetic buzz and
the wavering whine of shortwave frequencies

MANS VOICE FROM RADIO

(Quietly almost whispering)
Infrared and other special measures
indicated north of the rear battery

32A EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT

A metallic ticking sound

The hand of a massive iron clock closes on the hour
1000

A rusty bell rings briefly and sprays tiny water
droplets

Damp flares are strewn across the wet wooden-planked
floor

Raphaels hands grip a dripping flare and slide it into a
rifle-based launcher

A shot

33A EXTERIOR MUD NIGHT

The flare soars and belches out intermittent sparks
starts to whirl and dive and falls into the mud ina
phosphoric glow twitches convulsively like a burned
jellyfish hisses dies away and a cloud of smoke
disperses around it It lies in the mud sooty
blackened—like a burnt can of food

32B EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT

RAPHAELs hands pull up another soaked flare and slide it
into the launcher We see his silhouette against the dark
sky He cocks the launcher and shoots

33B EXTERIOR MUD NIGHT

The flare soars its trail steady A dull boom The flare
ignites and a tiny parachute opens A flickering beacon
lights up the area like a sparkler on a birthday cake

34 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

The light shines on the faces of the couple in the
Mercedes

The DRIVER steals a quick glance The WOMANs eyes stay
down

The COMMANDER hands the paperwork back to the driver
The Mercedes starts and then moves away The light
flickers on the wet road

35 INTERIOR TO EXTERIOR ICE CREAM TRUCK AND ROADBLOCK
NIGHT

The COMMANDER bends over the half-dismantled radio and
pokes around in its bowels He turns a screw with a
gentle movement and tunes to a radio station

He lights a cigarette smokes and listens

A song or rather a monologue with notes of music A
strange kitschy romantic tune

A long movement The camera leaves the commander exits
the ice cream truck and moves away turns and passes
alongside the gunners post that is lit by the dim
flickering glow of the fog light Amikam and Jonathan are
withdrawn into themselves listening to music They are
silent

A skinny cow walks on the road and calmly crosses the
roadblock They stare at it silently The cow disappears
into the darkness We face the deserted site The song
still rings out when suddenly a flashing appears from the
room in the deserted complex

36 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

JONATHAN raises his binoculars and peers
The room is dark for a moment Then suddenly another
flash and a trail of movement

37A EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER DESERTED SITE NIGHT

The sound of Gothic Rock from Raphaels earphones He
turns a heavy switch on a control box affixed next to
him

A creak and an electric buzz and the giant light behind
him trembles ignites and lights up

The light floods the room in the deserted site The room
is empty just a small puff of dust

Raphael turns the switch back and the light fades and
goes out with a dull hiss Its fan still turns for
fifteen seconds then dies into silence

Something attracts his attention A faraway dot of light
moving strangely

He puts a speaker to his lips pushes the button waits
for a small grating feedback to end and says

RAPHAEL
The runner is approaching repeat
the runner is approaching

His voice echoes from the speakers

37 INSERT EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

Jonathan gets up from the car seat walks over to the
concertina wire that blocks the road moves it aside
goes back to his place and sits

Silence

The noise of a faraway motor coming closer

A huge motorcycle emerges from the darkness crosses the
roadblock like a intercontinental rocket leaving behind
it black smoke and flying shreds of plastic

Jonathan gets up and moves the concerted wire back into
place

37B EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER DESERTED SITE
NIGHT

The iron clock in the tower ticks half a minute to
midnight

A glass with a little coffee moves in a rhythmic shiver
The coffee shakes

The flares also shake on the wet wooden floor

The sound of footsteps on the iron stairs Small
vibrations shake the tower

Raphael gets to his feet His face is pale but his gaze
is hot and sharp

A replacing soldier comes in and Raphael passes him
nods and leaves

The clock closes on midnight A short ring of a bell
The replacement soldier grabs a dripping flare and arms
the launcher

38 EXTERIOR MUD NIGHT

The COMMANDER AMIKAM and RAPHAEL plod along in the boggy
mud on their way from the road to the structure The
sound of a shot and the dull boom of the flare The
light begins to play on the walls of the leaning
structure and on their exhausted eyes

AMIKAM
(While they walk)
Dont you think the room is a bit
more crooked than it was yesterday

No one responds Just panting and concentration on their
efforts

39 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE - DRINKING FOUNTAIN
NIGHT

A long tin drinking fountain four taps over a deep
trough A hand opens a tap A rusted butterfly handle
turns with a creak The tin pipes shiver and the fountain
shakes The tap begins to rattle and whine It vibrates
and spews air and frozen blobs of water A long quarter-
minute of creaky shaking until the stream stabilizes and

the fountain calms down The three remaining taps open
and four pairs of filthy hands are washed Brown water
mixed with soap flows into the trough

40 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE INSERTS NIGHT

A can opener runs around the top of a can and opens it A
lump of tinned meat A thin layer of ice over the fat

A burner lights up under a row of four cans Fat runs
down the side of the first can and drips onto the flame
A long broken tssss”

41 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE - ROOM NIGHT

Camera moves from one CU to another Each soldier is deep
in his own thoughts and they eat the meat in silence
AMIKAM at the end of the line eats with a thoughtful
gaze and mumbles partly to his comrades partly to
himself
AMIKAM
We could check it

Wide view of the space

A row of four folding field cots a Spartan table and a
heap of cans of meat No windows just a muddy
flickering fluorescent lamp buzzing softly The walls
leak and the ceiling drips the floor is crooked and
everything leans to one side in a disturbing slant
Amikam goes to the heap of meat cans picks one and goes
with it to the slightly higher corner He sets the can
down on its side glances at his watch and releases his
grasp The can rolls across the floor until it hits the
lower corner of the structure

AMIKAM
Eight seconds If tomorrow it takes
less time well know the room is
getting more crooked
No one reacts They continue to eat in silence

A long silence

The COMMANDER glances at the screen of a plastic-clad
tablet and says

COMMANDER
Our next shift begins at eight

Looks at RAPHAEL and says

COMMANDER
Raphael roadblock

Raphael nods
Turns to JONATHAN

COMMANDER
Jonathan gun

Jonathan nods
Looks at Amikam

COMMANDER
And you’re in the tower

AMIKAM
The tower sir

COMMANDER
Good night

No answer He doesnt expect one

42 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE - ROOM NIGHT

Wide view from the ceiling The camera moves from cot to
cot

The sound of a video game explosions and gunfire The
COMMANDER is on his cot leaning against the wall bent
over the screen of his tablet and lost in his game

Now we continue and pass over Amikam who says

AMIKAM
If were leaning then in the end
well flip over and sink When that
happens itll happen in a split
second I dont know if Ill have
time to say I told you so so Im
saying it now

Silence

Raphael rests staring at the ceiling smoking Sounds of
Heavy Metal music comes out of his earphones He has a
pillow patterned with splashes of blood lots of it Like
after a bullet to the head

JONATHAN lies at the end of the row bent over his
notebook and writes His pillow has a spiral printed on
it

He hears a faint creak and directs his flashlight to the
floor by his cot Muffled bubbling sounds A trickle of
murky water bubbles up from the floor

43 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

A puddle Hard rain whips down on it for a moment then
suddenly lets up and stops

A few last drops and we can already recognize the
reflection of RAPHAEL

The rain has melted the tattoo of the sea nymph with the
amputated fin and it is running down his neck Long beads
of water stream down and turn from transparent to purple
He looks out into the room in the deserted site The room
is empty Dripping The floor is muddy Small puddles

44 EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER AND ROADBLOCK DAY

View of the top of the tower Two loudspeakers against
the somber sky The message rings out

You have entered a military zone
Please stop in front of the
roadblock

AMIKAM stands in the tower observing
A small van nears the roadblock slows and stops

45 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

View of the drivers photograph Around sixty

The COMMANDER raises his eyes looks at the driver and
disappears under the sunshade

RAPAHEL opens the rear door Boxes of various toys packed
tightly one on the other fill the van He pulls out a
box A robot-like soldier made of cheap plastic It looks
like a cyborg from a sci-fi B-movie

46 EXTERIOR-INTERIOR INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK DAY

CU of the keyboard the aging monitor behind it

The commanders hand sets down a cup containing the
remains of coffee It sits between him and the monitor
Through the smeared glass of the monitor we see his
fingers typing The drivers face is on the screen

The radio murmurs A panel light flickers Obscure
military verbiage in low volume almost whispering A
mans voice says

MANS VOICE
(From radio)

Fire control and topographical data
processing across the peripheral
axis

47 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

Jonathan is bent over drawing by the machine gun

He suddenly senses something raises his eyes and sees
the vans driver staring at him a direct and intense
look An unnerving look

A moment of locked eyes in an effort to be direct with
the driver

The commander returns the documents to the driver

The driver takes his documents one more look at
Jonathan then he starts the van and drives away

RAPHAELS hand sets the toy robot soldier on the road
The toy soldier marches in place raises his gun and
shoots at the back of the van A red light flashes from
the barrel A moment later he shoots again and again
time after time marches in place and shoots in a
continuous loop

48 EXTERIOR-INTERIOR INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK DAY

The COMMANDER is bent over the half-dismantled radio and
rummages around in its entrails He turns a screw gently
and then listens

Under the electronic murmur we hear classical music

He fine-tunes to it Mahlers fifth symphony He lights a
cigarette smokes and listens

A long camera move leaves him

Tracks of rain weave between the knobs of the half-
disassembled radio A small puddle forms under it A moth
gets caught on the surface among grease stains and
flecks of rust The sounds of the symphony swell The
moth floats its wings tremble

49 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

A small grating sound of feedback and AMIKAMs voice from
the loudspeakers

AMIKAM
The runner is approaching
Repeat the runner is approaching

Raphael moves aside the concerted wire blocking the road
The symphony is at its climax Now in the light of day
we recognize the military BMW (or some other massive

motorcycle) roaring across the roadblock The cyclist or
runner bent over A tight-fitting military jacket with
a furry collar and an opaque helmet

Screams

Jonathan lowers the binoculars and looks up to the sky
A flight of gulls crosses above the mud over the
deserted site

He stares at the gulls for a long moment

54 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

The van with the toys comes back from the opposite
direction
The message sounds again

55 EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER AND ROADBLOCK DAY

The cassette rewinds and stops A button releases

56 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

RAPHAEL opens the back door of the van The space that
had been packed tight with toys is now empty Just one
forgotten Barbie doll lies on the floor

57 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE DAY

The Barbie doll is bent over Her elbows leaning on
RAPHAELS muddy boot

The robot soldier is pressed against her from behind
marching on the spot and shooting Barbie is pushed
slightly forward and it looks like he is fucking her and
shooting fucking and shooting

A can of meat crosses them and rolls down the slanting
floor

We slide over the rolling can and it hits the wall in the
lower corner of the room

A rivulet of cloudy water starts forming in the corner

AMIKAM
(Glances at his watch and announces
worriedly)
Seven seconds
(Turns his eyes to his comrades)
One second less than yesterday

Wide view They eat in silence Just the sound of the toy
soldier fucking and shooting

cut

With his pen JONATHAN draws a new tattoo on RAPHAELS
neck The Gothic Metal continues to murmur from Raphaels
earphones Amikam holds a stained shaving mirror to his
profile and shows it to him This time its a screaming
baby

AMIKAM

(Drones on in his monotonous voice while

holding the mirror)

Nice tattoo Artistic Full of
meaning And message

(Is silent for a moment)
Tomorrow the rain will erase it And
the day after tomorrow the sun will
melt the icebergs on the Pole and
the sea will flood the world And
then you can say goodbye to meaning
And to the message No more
message

COMMANDER
(from his bed without raising his eyes
from his tablet)
Itll take a little more than two
days for the sea to flood us Amikam

AMIKAM
I mean from a cosmic point of view
sir A point of view that brings up
questions

COMMANDER
What questions are bothering you
Amikam

AMIKAM
Philosophical ones sir What are we
fighting for here For what purpose

COMMANDER
I hadnt noticed you fighting here
Amikam

AMIKAM

Fighting a psychological war sir
Fighting the unknown

COMMANDER
And who is this unknown that youre
fighting

AMIKAM
If I knew who it was I wouldnt call
it unknown

A dull creaking sound A folding cot lurches They look
at each other in silence

AMIKAM
Were sinking

The COMMANDER glances at his tablet and says

COMMANDER
Our next shift starts at midnight

Looks at AMIKAM and says
COMMANDER
Youre with me at the roadblock
Amikam

AMIKAM
Im with you till the last bullet
sir

Raphael moves his pelvis like an ass-kisser

COMMANDER
(To Raphael)
Gun
Amikam sprays Raphael with an imaginary machine gun
Raphael throws himself on his cot and takes the bullets
convulsing and writhing Jonathan smiles

COMMANDER
(To Jonathan)
Tower
He starts his video game and says

COMMANDER
Good night

58 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE DAY

High view from the ceiling Camera moves from bed to bed
The COMMANDER is deep in his game AMIKAM AND RAPHAEL are
staring at the ceiling Silence Just the pounding murmur
from Raphaels earphones

The camera stops over Jonathans cot at the end of the
row He is bent over his notebook

AMIKAM
(To Jonathan)
Toss us a bone about what youre
scribbling there Give us a taste

Jonathan pulls himself together smiles and starts

JONATHAN
On the night before I went to the
army my father came into my room and
told me a story He said that
officially Im no longer a kid and
that this was his last bedtime story
He told me about his mother my
grandmother who was a child when the
Nazis killed her father in
Auschwitz in the Holocaust And a
moment before they took him from her
he managed to give her a rare old
Torah Jewish bible book that had
been passed on in the family for some
ten generations He gave her the book
and said that when the time came she
should give it to her son when he
became a soldier And never never
ever he told her never sell it
That was his last sentence

And so thirty years passed My father
was thirteen and the book that
survived the Holocaust along with my
grandmother lay on a small platform
in the middle of her Polish glass
case amongst her bottles of perfume
and her jewelry And my father knew
very well what the story of this
Torah was that it was antique and
sacred and rare how she had received
it from her father and that it was
the most important precious thing in
the family And well never never
ever sell it When you grow up and
youre a soldier she would say to
him ever since he was little Ill
give you the book and you will give
it to your son that is me

Then my father tells me since the
day has come for to become a soldier
that the day has come for him to give
me the book but

Here we see waves on the picture that take us back in
time
JONATHAN
One day when my father was on the
way home from school he saw a new
bookstore Journals it was called
A secondhand bookstore with books and
Magazines from all over the world
Back then there werent that many of
those yet and my father all turned
on goes in browses around the
shelves and among the magazines
about film stars comics and books
he suddenly sees a red magazine with
the title Playboy with the picture
of a blonde naked girl on the cover
The January 1970 Playmate
She had Xs over her nipples but it
astounded him Hed never seen such a
thing Didnt know it existed
She smiled at him so he reached out
to her like he was hypnotized and
opened it right at the centerfold
where you can see her on a double
page and get this
(Smiles)
No Xs over her nipples
He saw her for a split second then
the shop owner pops in suddenly out
of nowhere snatches away the
magazine and says No leafing
through kid 75 Lirot Either you
buy it or you leave right now

At the time 75 Lirot was a fortune
for a kid He had barely five saved
up So he left but he couldnt shake
it Just couldnt get it out of his
head He didnt eat didnt drink
couldnt think about anything He
just jerked off all day like a junkie
and fantasized about his Playboy
girl this January 1970 Playmate that
hed seen for a split second on
Allenby street in Tel Aviv

He barely slept at night and during
the short times he fell asleep
momentarily he dreamed how she was
climbing into his bed how he peels
the Xs off her nipples X after X
until hed get to that point At that
point hed have come It went

downhill — well beyond the sex thing
He was in love

In the morning he waited till his
mother left the house and found
himself in front of her glass case
pulling out the Torah He knew he was
doing something terrible but he
couldn’t help himself He couldnt
control it

He felt himself being dragged to
Allenby Street into the store like
a zombie Saw how his hand offered
the Torah and heard himself ask to
exchange it for the red Playboy
Magazine

And just like it took him a split
second to glance at the Playboy
magazine and fall in love so did it
take the bookstore owner a split
second to look at the Torah and say
Take your Playboy magazine and beat
it

So my father took the magazine and
gave it to his friends to circulate
among them which made him king of
his class for a day At the end of
the day the magazine got back to him
but its pages were stuck together and
there was no saving it It was
ruined lost

And then get this My father
suddenly offers me a Playboy magazine
from January 1970 the original
Magazine that hed ordered for me
over the Internet with the January
Playmate and the Xs in her nipples
And he says Son Keep this magazine
and give it to your son when he
becomes a soldier

And most importantly he said to me
“Never never ever come on the pages
when you jerk off

They laugh

JONATHAN
I think he was a bit stoned I think
he and my mother smoke joints from
time to time

A short silence

JONATHAN
That night I heard them fuck like I
never did before

AMIKAM
What happened with your grandmother
when she found out

JONATHAN
I never asked

AMIKAM
Why not

JONATHAN
This was the last bedtime story he
told me I didnt want to spoil it
If he wanted to end the story like
that then thats how the story ends

59(NEW) INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT

Jonathan is asleep His head slightly drooping to one
side In the background the giant light is turned off
and silent

60(NEW) INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT

Raphael at the gun post His head nods back and forth
with the beat pounding from his earphones Amikam leans
over next to him and speaks

In the background the ice cream truck with the laughing
ice cream girl painted on its side

AMIKAM
(in his monotonous voice)
Dont you get the conspiracy How
they stick to your back like leeches
They read what youre thinking write
down what you say

He is quiet for a moment He looks at Raphael who
continues to nod his head and asks

AMIKAM
Can you even hear me

Raphael nods

Its not clear whether its a Yes or nodding to the
beat from his earphones

AMIKAM
(continues )
Theyre everywhere Even here
Watching us Following us
(lowers his voice a little)
You and I for example are being
photographed right now Yes Yes
(Nods )
You heard me

Raphael doesnt react but this doesnt faze Amikam and
he continues and says

AMIKAM
Were being photographed and
recorded and if you didnt know it
until now you should wake up man
Because everything you see around
here its all an illusion
Even youre an illusion Raphael And
Im actually talking to an illusion
here get it A fucking fata morgana
Couldnt you be some blonde like
say Larissa from Big Brother Or
Jessica Rabbit That Roger must have
had a serious tool Otherwise how can
you explain this super-piece marrying
a rabbit

An American car emerges suddenly from the fog slides
into the frame and stops Amikam and Raphael jump up in
alarm Raphael cocks the machine gun
COMMANDERS VOICE
(yelling)
Amikam get away from that car
61(NEW) INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT
Jonathan sleeps
COMMANDERS FARAWAY VOICE
(Yelling)

Jonathan

Jonathan wakes up in alarm and turns on the spotlight

62 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

The spotlight switches on A circle of light around the
car
The woman beside the driver begins to whimper

COMMANDERS VOICE
(Yells)
Raphael get down

Raphael crouches and disappears into the gunners post

COMMANDERS VOICE
(Echoes through the megaphone)
Driver Get out of the car

The door opens hesitantly A man in a dinner jacket gets
out with his hands in the air and yells

DRIVER
(yells)
Dont shoot at us We didnt do
anything
COMMANDERS VOICE
Close your door slowly

The driver shuts the door slowly

COMMANDERS VOICE
Stand next to the door

A hesitant step forward

COMMANDERS VOICE
Against the car

He presses himself against the car

COMMANDERS VOICE
Put your hands on the roof

He obeys and puts his hands on the roof
COMMANDERS VOICE
Now the woman Get out of the car
slowly

She doesnt move only whimpers and sits frozen

DRIVER
(Shouts)
Get out of the car Marianne

The door opens and a fat woman starts to get out of the
car
COMMANDERS VOICE
With the bag Pick up your bag But
slowly

She whimpers but obeys and gets out of the car with her
bag
COMMANDERS VOICE
(Still off-camera through the shrill
megaphone)
Now empty all the contents of the bag
onto the road
Whimpering she empties the bag with trembling hands
Makeup a small mirror a key ring and some other
everyday items fall between trembling high heels
An ID card in a small puddle The smiling photo of the
woman under the murky water
Thunder crashes the sky opens and rain whips across the
puddle
The womans hairdo falls apart her makeup runs down her
face and the evening dress she is wearing becomes
translucent and clings to her folds of fat Her husband
looks at her defeated and humiliated

63 EXTERIOR INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK NIGHT

High view over the commander He types The rain whips
the leaking roof
From the radio a quiet male voice says

RADIO VOICE
Explosives were blasted at average
point of height from rear cover post

64 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DESERTED SITE NIGHT

The COMMANDER gives the documents back to the driver and
says

COMMANDER
I apologize for the mistake Go

The car crosses in front of his face and drives away He
keeps standing on the side of the road and looks at the
deserted site A short dark moment and again the long
defiant flickering

Behind him deep in the muddy frame the tower The
spotlight turns on

He lifts his arms in an X The spotlight fades off

He scans the dark site through his night vision
binoculars

COMMANDER
(To Amikam standing next to him)
Tomorrow first thing we wont go to
sleep before we check out that
goddamn place

65 EXTERIOR MOSTLY IN THE MUD DAY

A foggy morning A cloud has settled on the muddy
expanse

The commander leads his three soldiers inside this screen
of fog They make their way into the heart of the viscous
mud with marked effort

An exhausting minute of Sisyphean walking

The mud softens and becomes boggy then gives way to a
gigantic puddle

They advance with difficulty across the puddle and reach
a broken disintegrating fence On the fence is a sign
like a road sign with a generic symbol eg a hand like
a stop sign an exclamation mark and a large X or
perhaps a skull to indicate danger or no entry

They cross the fence and go in

66 EXTERIOR HANGAR DAY
The structure that is in the front part of the site
from which we saw most of the flashes

They stand facing the breached hangar They look small
and meaningless compared to its immense height and
enormous space within

COMMANDER
(After a long moment)
Well comb this structure then cross
the area in a straight line to the
other end

He looks at them Theyre exhausted His gaze is tired

A quiet voice from the portable radio (that TATTOO is
carrying on his back)
RADIO VOICE
Decimetric fire from front line posts
to depth of mined ridge

In silence they enter the mouth of the monstrous
structure

67 INTERIOR HANGAR DAY

The gigantic space is empty and deserted
Mostly puddles and ruins
They climb up iron stairs leading to the upper level

68 INTERIOR CORRIDOR DAY

A desolate corridor and empty rooms

They walk in single file The COMMANDER leads with
JONATHAN as rearguard

They split up

We stay with Jonathan who turns and enters one of the
rooms

69 INTERIOR ABANDONED ROOM DAY

A wall The remains of wet rotting felt wallpaper A
disintegrating leather armchair in a small puddle Beside
it a shaky floor lamp The same room he saw through his
binoculars (Scene 71b) Jonathan sits in the armchair and
presses the switch of the lamp A dry click the bulb
lights up but the room darkens Jonathan shifts his eyes
A window partly broken Remnants of a flapping curtain
Outside darkness Suddenly night has fallen
He approaches the window stands in front of it and peers
out into the dark
The glass is broken Its crack along his face
lengthwise Part of his face is exposed the other seen
through the cracked pane
He pulls out his flashlight aims it at the opaque
darkness before him and turns it on and off A short
single flash
A moment of nothing
A huge spotlight lights up from deep in the darkness and
floods him with a blinding powerful blaze He freezes
momentarily in the aura of light that seemingly tries to
swallow him He moves to the side in a half turn his
back now against the wall and sees himself asleep in the
armchair
VOICE OF THE COMMANDER
Were moving on

He wakes up The lamp beside him is turned off

The commander stands in the doorway stares at him for
another moment then leaves

Jonathan turns his eyes to the window There is no
window Just a sealed moist wall

70 EXTERIOR DESERTED SITE DAY

The fog is unstable at moments it thickens then it
thins out A sense of lightheadedness and loss of
direction

COMMANDER
(To Amikam)
Make sure were on course I want to
get to the other side to see whats
going on there then head back

They look small and vulnerable as they walk between
abandoned violated buildings The Commander in the lead
with AMIKAM close behind him mostly looking at his
compass RAPHAEL and JONATHAN in the rear

Here and there they stop and look for a moment A huge
plastic sheet whirling in the wind A crow hopping along
in the mud trying to fly fluttering in the air then
falling A skinny cow standing and staring at them from
the within fog

A few long minutes of walking in the inanimate world of
ruins and murky water

We can already see the far end where stands a gigantic
hangar broken open identical to the one they combed at
the entrance to the site

71 EXTERIOR HANGAR DAY

They stand at the edge of the hangars roof and observe
through binoculars
A long static moment

COMMANDER
(Without taking the binoculars off his
eyes)
We got off course and came back

AMIKAM lowers his gaze to his compass and says

AMIKAM
Not according to the compass

Continues to observe
A long silence
RAPHAEL
Whats he doing there

View through their binoculars
They see the roadblock and on the road a soldier dancing
the foxtrot

COMMANDER

Well turn around and go back
Im not leaving here without seeing
the other side

72 INTERIOR DESERTED SITE DAY

They go back to where they came from glued to the
compass and the few landmarks there are

The same crow trying to fly and falling the same
whirling plastic sheet and the same skinny cow staring
at them with its empty gaze

From the thinning fog the other end suddenly appears
Again the same huge hangar The same starting point
They stand facing the hangar and the endless mud

COMMANDER
(Looking through binoculars in the
direction of the roadblock )
We must have gotten vertigo We think
were going straight but were
walking in circles

AMIKAM
According to the compass we walked
in a straight line

A short silence

RAPHAEL
So the fucking compass is broken

They look crushed and exhausted They move away into the
mud and are swallowed in the fog
A quiet male voice comes from the portable radio

VOICE FROM RADIO
Chemical waste disposal unit on its
way to casualty collection point

74 EXTERIOR MUD NIGHT

A shot

The soaring flare is reflected in a puddle

The flash starts and stops and the flare whirls flickers
for another moment and dives into the puddle

73B EXTERIOR INTERIOR TOWER NIGHT

Another shot Another flare is launched it opens lights
up the tower with a flickering light Raphael stands in

the front of the tower and looks at the flare His
silhouette appears then vanishes between darkness and
light

75 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DESERTED SITE NIGHT

JONATHAN shrinks in the gunners post under the beach
umbrella that flaps wildly in the wind threatening to
collapse He is drawing in his notebook

Boom

The flare opens and its light flickers on Jonathan’s
face

His gaze is tired His eyes begin to close His head
droops and he nods off for a short moment then wakes up
with a start

76 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DESERTED SITE NIGHT

A flicker And another Jonathan cocks the machine gun
Again a flicker a long one and he shoots a single
bullet into the darkness before him

Barking and whining

The spotlight turns on and begins to dart about the muddy
expanse in a long frantic search until it stops on a
filthy bleeding dog Barking whining barking
JONATHAN stares at it shocked

The dog suddenly collapses and falls over tries to get
up and falls again

Jonathan wakes up again gasping His eyes are moist
perhaps a long tear

AMIKAMS VOICE
You killed him

Jonathan looks up at him questioningly

JONATHAN
Who

AMIKAM
Your dog

Jonathan directs a frightened look to the muddy expanse
which we see from his point of view A vague faraway
sound sharpens and becomes a siren A large sheet of
plastic bursts out from the dark whirls in the wind and
flies toward him

He opens his eyes and awakens from the nightmare in a
panic A heavy semi-trailer carrying a tank crosses the
roadblock sounding its horn continuously

Now he really wakes up scared and glistening with sweat
The rain whips across the road

The sunshade threatens to fall over

77 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT
The announcement rings out again

ANNOUNCEMENT
You have entered a military zone

A shining Mercedes slows then stops The headlights go
out

AMIKAM turns on the flashlight The beam of light smears
across the windshield

At the steering wheel a BOY At his side a GIRL We see
them alternately One moment the rain blurs their image
The next moment a wiper shifts the water and exposes
their faces

The COMMANDER approaches An electric window lowers and
opens

Now we can see another boy and girl in the back seat
Theyre seventeen at most Kids of good families all
scrubbed and shining Gelled hair makeup you can
actually smell the perfumes

The commander studies them at length The rain whips on
his face

78 EXTERIOR-INTERIOR ROADBLOCK INSIDE ICE CREAM
TRUCK NIGHT

Very close view of the commanders fingers typing lines
of black dirt under his fingernails The face of the girl
who sat beside the driver now appears on the screen The
grainy image blurs for a moment and a big drop of water
slides down the screen like a tear on the girls face

A quiet male voice from the radio
VOICE FROM RADIO
Sterile crushing point between seam
line and regional access axis

79A EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BEHIND MERCEDES NIGHT

AMIKAM checks the trunk
Spare tire toolbox and a large gift box

80A EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK MACHINE GUN POST NIGHT

JONATHAN bends over the side of the gun and looks at the
profile of the girl sitting in the front passenger seat
Her neck is delicate

79B EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BEHIND MERCEDES NIGHT
AMIKAM looks suspiciously at the gift box bends over it
and listens

81A EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) TOWER NIGHT

The hand of the massive clock ticks A quarter of a
minute to 900

80B EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK MACHINE GUN POST NIGHT

The GIRL looks out the window and crosses JONATHANS
gaze

The window is wet and the ensuing blurring gives her a
mysterious air

A moment of meeting of eyes

Her friends steal snickering looks at him Her smile
which earlier felt sincere suddenly seems amused at his
embarrassed reaction

81B EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) TOWER NIGHT

The hand of the clock jumps to 900

Ringing

79D EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BEHIND MERCEDES NIGHT
AMIKAM places a hesitant hand on the lid of the gift box
Debates whether to pull the ribbon and open it

81C EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) TOWER NIGHT

RAPHAELS hands pick up a flare

82A EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BY DRIVERS WINDOW NIGHT

The COMMANDER hands the driver the documents The driver
takes them and one slips out of his hand drops onto the
commanders shoe and falls under the car

79E EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BEHIND MERCEDES NIGHT

Amikam gives the wrapping ribbon a little pull
hesitates and decides not to open the box

His fingers relax their grip on the ribbon and his palm
lets go

82B EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK BY DRIVERS WINDOW NIGHT

The Commander bends down and as he picks up the document
sees the hem of the girls dress caught in the closed car
door

COMMANDER
(to driver)
Her dress is caught in the door

He gives back the documents

COMMANDER
Go

81D EXTERIOR (INTERIOR) TOWER NIGHT

Raphael fires

83 EXTERIOR SKY NIGHT

The flare soars upward and spits out an intermittent
stream of sparks starts to whirl around and then dives
down

84 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

The car starts to move forward the girl bends down and
opens the door a crack She pulls in her dress
The failed flare falls on the road near the slightly open
door It rolls Amikam closes the trunk and sees the half
open door and the rolling flare
From his viewpoint this looks bad and he shouts
terrified
AMIKAM
Grenade

JONATHAN raises his eyes with a hysterical look For a
moment he sees the girls hand slip into the closing door
and something rolling on the road He squeezes the
trigger of the machine gun

View from high above were above the car JONATHAN
shoots continuously

The car caves into itself a jumble of metal and glass
shards

A last bullet echoes into a dull silence Everyone
freezes In the background the ice cream truck and the
laughter of the fresh-looking ice cream girl painted on
it It seems she is looking at the bullet-ridden Mercedes
through stains of rust

The rain washes the blood from the road

85A EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK NIGHT

Wide view (maybe from the tower) of the roadblock the
muddy expanse and the road

Orange flashing lights get brighter in the corner of the
screen

In the soundtrack we hear the COMMANDERs voice talking
on the radio

COMMANDERS VOICE
Cornelia from Foxtrot we blocked the
axis all along the sector The road
is sterile I repeat the road is
sterile over

AUTHORITATIVE VOICE
Foxtrot from Cornelia Rhino on its
way to you stand by

The flashing lights color the corner of the screen
A huge trailer truck carrying a heavy bulldozer comes
into the frame and slowly crawls along the road

COMMANDERS VOICE
Rhino is entering the puddle

The truck slows laboriously then stops A dull creaking
of brakes The lights go off and the motor falls silent
85B EXTERIOR-INTERIOR INSIDE ICE CREAM TRUCK NIGHT

COMMANDER
(Holding the radios microphone)
Rhino in the puddle this is Foxtrot
I repeat Rhino is in the puddle

86 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK MUD NIGHT

The bulldozer trembles then starts up A blob of black
smoke a grating noise

The monotonous sound of warning beeps The flashing
lights on the bulldozer The monster heavily comes down
from the back of the truck drives deep into the muddy
expanse and stops

In the tower the spotlight switches on A circle of light
around the bulldozer and the mud The gigantic blade
stabs into the mud and the bulldozer begins to dig A
long minute with the digging bulldozer

The pit is already deep The bulldozer backs away turns
and returns to the roadblock loads the bullet-riddled
car onto its blade returns with it to the mud and
throws it into the pit

It falls with a dull thud The bulldozer starts to cover
it with mud

The mud falls onto the roof of the car and flows down
around it swallowing it more and more until the car
disappears into the mud The bulldozer continues to fill
the hole for another long moment

The bulldozer packs the mud flat turns and leaves the
frame Its tracks remain

Rain begins to fall blurring the tracks The tracks
disappear Only mud

87 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

A grey morning A gloomy sky A supply truck is parked on
the side of the road The driver is unloading an
impressive amount of canned meat and flares

The noise of a helicopter Plastic sheets fly around
wind hits the road and a military helicopter lands A
high-ranking OFFICER comes out of the helicopter
energetically stops for a moment in front of the mud and
looks at his polished shoes A moment of hesitation then
a step into the mud

88 INTERIOR LEANING STRUCTURE DAY

The room is now very crooked truly diagonal
The officer stands in the center His shoes are filthy
The commander and his three soldiers sit facing him

OFFICER
As I understand it you acted
according to the rules But in war as
in war and were in a war here Have
no doubt about it
In war shit happens So whatever
happened happened and I dont want
to go into the details because if we
start digging into them all of you
here will pay the price

He falls silent and drags out the moment creating an
aftereffect to what he said

OFFICER
So as I see it this file is closed
before it was opened And if anyone
here has a problem with that let him
speak up here and now

A long thick silence You could cut into it
The officers cell phone starts ringing He presses it to
his ear and says

OFFICER
(into phone)
Hey Shmulik whats up
Listens for a moment then says
Got it Tell his father hes on his
way home

Raises his eyes and asks

OFFICER
Which one of you is Jonathan Feldman

JONATHAN (who shot at the car) raises a hesitant hand

OFFICER
(cont )
Get on the supply truck outside
youre going home

Jonathan looks at the officer wants to say something
but changes his mind and remains silent

89 EXTERIOR ROADBLOCK DAY

The helicopter takes off and disappears

Jonathan drags himself across the viscous mud away from
the very crooked structure

Amikam at his side slightly behind him

AMIKAM
(Babbling and panting)
Dont take it to heart It happened
And tomorrow as they say the sun
will shine and the fields will fill
with honey See what I mean
Jonathan

JONATHAN

You mean from a cosmic point of
view Amikam

AMIKAM
Cosmic only All the rest is an
illusion

They arrive at the ice cream truck and stop beside it

JONATHAN
Why dont you go bullshit someone
else Amikam If you hadnt yelled
Grenade to me I wouldnt have
fired

AMIKAM

(Shaking his head pityingly)
The universe is indifferent
Jonathan It doesnt settle accounts
with you In ten years youll be
floating in a pool on the roof of
your penthouse and thinking to
yourself Amikam was right My life
isnt so bad And what did I do
anyway Hes the one who yelled
‘Grenade Maybe hes the one who
fired too

JONATHAN
Youre fucked up Amikam
(Smiles a little)
But its not your fault that you are

AMIKAM
(Smiles)
Hug

Jonathan takes his time to agree

AMIKAM
Come on dont play hard to get

Jonathan relents They hug

AMIKAM
(While hugging)
Were modern men Jonathan Men who
like women but arent embarrassed to
hug each other

RAPHAEL
(Shouting from the doorway of the leaning
structure)

Faggots
Amikam gives him the finger

VOICE FROM THE RADIO
(inside the ice cream truck)
Sterile smashing point between seam
line and regional access axis

Jonathan climbs into the supply truck

Wide perspective view The road crosses the mud and is
swallowed by the fog

The truck moves away and fades into the fog

The soldier who opened the sequence begins to dance his
foxtrot on the road Silence Just his breathing and the
tapping of this feet on the asphalt

He turns to us and takes a little bow

is revealed A blink then a tear

A real tear drops onto the drawing

Now we see Michaels hands holding the notebook It is
stained A little sooty

92 INTERIOR JONATHANS ROOM EARLY EVENING

Closed CU

We dont see the room yet just Michaels eyes staring at
the drawing Silence His face is motionless Just a tiny
smile and teary eyes

The distant sound of children playing enters the
soundtrack

Wide view Now we see the whole room

A single bed a naked mattress a rolled-up rug MICHAEL
sits on the corner of the bed facing a wardrobe whose
doors are open It is empty A desk covered with a
plastic sheet No books no things Just the notebook in
Michaels hands The tumult of the childrens distant
voices emphasizes the silence

93A INTERIOR KITCHEN EARLY EVENING

A birthday cake Layers of cream and chocolate with lots
of whipped cream on top Twenty candied cherries form
the number 20 Close view Dafnas fingers stick
sparklers into the cherries They look like thin black
candles Her movement is stiff Her nails bitten

CUT TO BLACK
Title Dafna

93B INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN EARLY EVENING

A sink hot water a rough scrubby and a close view of
DAFNAs hands washing dishes Flecks of flour and
eggshells the whisks of a mixer with remains of sticky
chocolate

Things for making the cake

cU of her face It is hard pinched Splotches of
exhaustion under her bitter angry gaze

She finishes the dishes but continues to rub the scrubby
on her knuckles opening wounds that begin to bleed

She looks at her hands for a moment and immediately
throws the scrubby into the sink Until now she wasnt
aware Only when she sees her hand does she understand
and feel

94 INTERIOR APARTMENT CORRIDOR AND JONATHANS ROOM
EARLY EVENING

We see the corridor from the doorway of Jonathans room
Dafna comes out of the kitchen at the end of the
corridor approaches the doorway of the room while wiping
her hands on a kitchen towel comes into CU and says

DAFNA
We agreed youd call That you
wouldnt come here unannounced
anymore

Her look is disturbed but her voice makes an effort to
stay restrained and dry

Michael sits on the corner of the bed on the bare
mattress surrounded by Jonathans empty room and is
silent Silence

DAFNA
(Choking down her mounting anger)
Why are you doing this to me Did
you think Im over it Or that Im
lonely

He remains quiet and looks at her
A moment of locked eyes

MICHAEL
(In a quiet voice)
I thought that today

DAFNA
(Cuts in with her cold voice)
Today of all days I didnt want to
see you

A frozen silence

Michael lowers his eyes to her hands

With the small towel she quickly hides the wounds on her
finger joints Small bloodstains on the towel She hides
the stains with her palm

MICHAEL
(Raises his head almost in a whisper)

Either you hate me or youre
fighting against what you still feel
for me
DAFNA

(Bursts out)
Want to know what I feel I feel
nothing Thats what I feel

(Loses herself for a moment)
Im bursting with emptiness

(Takes a breath restrains her outburst)
Dont come here anymore Dont do
this to me

She opens a side door and disappears with a slam
Silence Just the faraway murmur of playing children

95 INTERIOR APARTMENT BATHROOM EARLY EVENING

A small bottle of alcohol A bloody cotton swab immersed
in the clear liquid The blood dissolves into a dark
cloud that disperses like pink silk threads
DAFNA’s hand grasps the moist Q-tip and places it onto
one of her knuckles She looks at the stinging wound and
sighs quietly Perhaps just a breath part pain part
relief Maybe this physical pain calms her defuses the
rage pent up inside her Something inside her gives in
and gives up and the hard look in her eyes weakens and
relaxes
A quiet knock on the door and MICHAELs voice on the
other side
MICHAELS VOICE

Im leaving now Dafna Im sorry I

thought maybe you know today wed

do something Together

Dafnas face is flooded with tears
MICHAELS VOICE

I just had to sit in Jonathans room
for a while And see you

Again a flood of tears and silent weeping
A long moment of silence

MICHAELS VOICE
Just tell me youre okay in there

With effort she controls her weeping and says

DAFNA

Sorry I threw away the things in

Jonathans room
(Her lips tremble silently only the tears
flow)

Its because of his smell

(continues while weeping noiselessly)
I cant bear the way things lose the
smell of my boy

Wide view
She sits on the toilet lid and cries softly

96 INTERIOR APARTMENT CORRIDOR AND BEDROOM EARLY
EVENING

Michael stands pressed against the bathroom door

CU of MICHAEL

His face is pressed against the closed door and his eyes
are moist Maybe a tear rolls down his unshaven cheek In
the soundtrack we hear the muffled sounds of a faraway
television the murmur of a laughing audience

DAFNAS CRACKED VOICE
(Through the door)
What did you want to do together

Michael wants to say something but changes his mind and
remains still

DAFNAS VOICE
(After a long moment)
Dont go

Wide view over the corridor For a moment Michael stands
facing the closed door He then takes 2-3 steps and
passes the bedroom Its door is partly open He turns and
stops

97 INTERIOR APARTMENT BEDROOM EARLY EVENING

The room is shuttered and dusky The TV is on the sound
is turned down Blue light dances on slept-in sheets The
murmur of a laughing audience Michael is still stuck for
a moment in front of the partly open door then comes in
stands before the bed and looks Pills A half eaten
candy bar Chocolate crumbs An open packet of tissues A
few more used ones

MICHAEL looks down

Dafnas nightgown lies on the floor

He hesitates for a moment but then bends over picks up
the nightgown and lays it onto the corner of the bed He
puts the tissues and pills on the night stand by the bed
Wraps the chocolate bar and lays it beside them Gathers
up the chocolate crumbs and balled up tissues picks up
the remote control Straightens up and turns off the TV
The murmur cuts off to silence

9798 INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN CORRIDOR EARLY
EVENING

The lid of a garbage bin is raised and opened Compressed
garbage almost overflowing Michaels hand pushes in the
balled up tissues and crumbs He washes his hands
thoroughly Takes a wrinkled towel lying thrown on the
marble top by the sink wipes off his hands hangs it up
on the hook and straightens it with a small stretching
movement

Something catches his eye Four cups on a shelf he
changes the placement of the cups and turns the handles
to the same direction like soldiers on parade

We leave him with a long camera move and exit the kitchen
to the corridor At the end of the corridor we now see
Jonathans empty room through the wide open door The dog
is lying in the doorway Hes still waiting

98A INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN EARLY EVENING TO
NIGHT

End of day light enters from the window its the only
one lighting the kitchen and Michael and Dafna

DAFNAs hands grasp a bottle of whisky There are Band-
Aids on her knuckles She pours MICHAEL looks at the
bandages

DAFNA
(While performing her actions)
Dont say anything about this

Finishes pouring raises her glass in a small movement

DAFNA
Or about this

Drinks deeply
DAFNA
I know I look like a cliché

She is silent for a moment then says

DAFNA
Anyway life is hopeless so instead
of fighting it and making the effort
to go on Ive decided to invest in
my decline To foster it
If theres anything left that can
infuse some life into me its my
urge for self-destruction

They sit at the table He at the narrow end she next to
him wearing a simple nightgown and sweater her hair
damp her eyes softening

On the counter at the far end of the kitchen sits a
birthday cake

A long silence

Suddenly she realizes something sniffs and says

DAFNA
Youre smoking again

MICHAEL
No
But a small childish smile betrays him
Also in her the trace of a smile is noticeable
She sips whisky and says

DAFNA
Okay so give me a cigarette

He pulls out a pack One cigarette for her one for him
They smoke together close in silence A long intimate
and quiet minute

98 INSERT EXTERIOR SKY VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW DAY

A piece of sky through a double window with a worn wooden
frame and a turbid pane

A kite dances in the air Appears momentarily then
vanishes hidden by the window frame and the peeling
wall

98 INSERT-2 INTERIOR VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW DAY

The eyes of young DAFNA through the glass following the
kite with small movements and hidden occasionally behind
the window frame

A duet between DAFNAS look and the kite

DAFNA
(VO over the picture)

I liked our roof apartment best the
one overlooking the sea Remember how
we talked all night about the films
wed seen how we wanted to travel
the world study do things

(Drinks deeply)
The smell of the sea And the taste
of saltin the air

The window opens to the right and the left
A seagull flies in front of the open window
A girls hair whips in the wind

Sea A small sailboat

It was an ordinary day but I
remember thatI felt exalted A
feeling that anything was possible

98B INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN EARLY EVENING TO
NIGHT

End-of-day light enters from the window It is the only
source of light that lights the kitchen and Michael and
Dafna The light will fade gradually throughout the
scene evening will fall and the kitchen will darken

The four mugs that MICHAEL straightened on the shelf
Camera movement from one mug to the next On the first
mug the name Michael under the picture of a
rhinoceross head On the next one Dafna under an
iguana The third Alma under a black cat And
Jonathan with a dolphin

DAFNA
(VO continues)

It didnt last more than a few
minutes but I felt it in every cell
in my body And I remember thinking
to myself that
this moment is the beginning of a
great and real happiness about to
enter my life That Im going to be
happy that Im only at the
beginning

Dafna and Michael next to each other at both corners of
the table
We approach them in a long slow movement

DAFNA
(VO continues)

A week later I discovered I was
pregnant I felt my life had been
stolen from me I wanted an abortion
but you wouldnt let me You said
that our love couldnt triumph over
that And that youd leave me

(Takes another sip)

I even made an appointment for an
abortion

I remember sitting trembling in
front of a doctor who explained to me
that it was too late That now it
would be murder

After Jonathan was born not a day
passed without me thinking that hes
here thanks to you and that I

(Wants to drink more but sees that the
glass is empty and gives up)

am undeserving We never talked
about it but it was
alwaysfloating in the air my
feeling of guilt

(Pours herself another glass and says
while performing her actions)

Because of this guilt feeling I loved
him even more
More than I was capable of containing
inside me
Because theres a kind of intensity
almost violent in love that’s
infused with guilt

(A direct look)
And I loved him more than Alma This
is a terrible thing Im saying I
know that Lately Im being plagued
by terrible thoughts

(a long sip)
I loved him because he had me in him
Because he had in him all the things
I had in me before he was born The

things that made you fall in love
with me The things you forced me to
relinquish and I did give them up
when I gave birth to Jonathan For
you

(A bitter laugh)
Any shrink would probably have a
field day with me now
(Already a little drunk)

The approaching movement comes to a stop An intimate
frame of the two

DAFNA empties her glass pours herself another and takes
a long gulp She sinks into herself is silent for a
Moment and says

DAFNA

Sometimes Im sorry I didnt have the
abortion

(Again a small pause)
Because the joy of having a child is
easily taken for granted You dont
walk around feeling this continuous
high But the pain of not having him
anymore is a daily one Its
intolerable

(Sighs)

MICHAEL extends a hand picks up a salt cellar puts it
back into its rack beside the pepper and straightens the
rack until its in line with the wall

DAFNA reacts immediately shifts the rack pulls out the
salt cellar and lays it on its side Grains of salt
scatter on the table She moves her glass and spills a
little whisky by the salt cellar

She takes a last pull on her cigarette and puts it out in
the small puddle of whisky

(Pours more into her glass even though
its not empty and mutters to herself)
Why couldnt he die when they
announced it to us A normal death

(Sips)

Legitimate
(Continues quietly but with an inner
trembling that creeps into her voice)

DAFNA

Why is it like a punishment or
someones revenge maybe its God
getting even with us with you I
mean I didnt mean to take away your
credit you know
And the fact that I understand that
you didnt mean to kill your child
doesnt help me to be able to sleep
in one bed with you to live with
you Only six months have passed and
I dont

(another long sip)
Never mind

DAFNA
But Im also to blame here Theres
no doubt By my passivity By not
snatching the phone away from you By
not sticking my nails in you By not
biting you I lived alongside your
(psychological) damage Pretending
not to see in order not to embarrass
you Leaning on you in order to make
you strong so you dont notice that
I see see that you are weak that
you have a secret that you are
ashamed of yourself And that your
life meaning your office us the
car and this You can rely on me
that you try hard to scatter around
you — its all there just to hide
this secret this weakness
You are weak Michael
I saw it Alma sees it And Jonathan
saw it and Max Max feels it
between his ribs He has a chronic
bruise there did you know that From
your kicks

He lowers his eyes A long oppressive silence

The tension that broke for a moment builds up again
Dim thin light still enters through the window The
kitchen darkens night falls She raises her eyes A
simple clock on the wall above the kitchen doorway it’s
almost six oclock Michael tries to say something but
she gets up moves away to the corner of the kitchen

She stands in front of the cake and stares out of the
window The last light of the day embraces her
silhouette

Her CU
The soft light caresses her face She looks out silently

DAFNA
(After a long pause in a quiet voice)
Want to see something Come on

Night falls by the moment The kitchen is dusky almost
completely dark

Michael approaches from the dark comes into the last
light that enters from the window and stands at her
side a little behind her looking out over her shoulder

99 EXTERIOR ABANDONED SWIMMING POOL EVENING

Last light of day on the abandoned swimming pool The
walls have darkened to black but the sky is indigo

A thin bent man walks along the edge of the pool
lengthwise A bucket and squeegee Steady steps He looks
like a maintenance man He disappears behind a concrete
column that demarcates the corner of the frame

A moment of nothing happening

A light flickers and turns on A round spotlight falls on
the floor of the empty pool

The maintenance man enters the frame and walks back along
the length of the pool His silhouette stretches across
the wall He is whistling clearly Somewhere over the
Rainbow or something similar

100 INTERIOR APARTMENT KITCHEN NIGHT

The camera floats backward in a slow crawl We are now
behind Dafnas shoulder Michael is dimly reflected in
the window He blends with the painting of the baby
Dafna turns her gaze backward and says

DAFNA
I didnt mean it Im sorry
(Smiles slightly drunkenly)

Come on

He is smiling again now She picks up the cake He pours
more whisky onto the glasses and they sit down again on
either side of the cake

The kitchen is now dark

Dafnas dim silhouette takes a long sip

DAFNA
Lets devote ourselves to the grief

She strikes a match that lights her eyes

DAFNA
Indulge in it

She lights one of the sparklers shed stuck into the
cake A flash of light runs along the string of
sparklers and everything becomes one big flickering
light shaped like the number 20 Dafna smiles Michael
looks at her and she looks at the cake Her smile is
childish and captivating The light dances on their faces
for a long moment until it fades and goes out
Darkness

Silence

Michaels voice after a long silence from within the
darkness

MICHAELS VOICE
I just saw the smile that made me
fall in love with you

Another short silence

DAFNAS VOICE
(From the darkness)
What smile

MICHAELS VOICE
(From the darkness)
The smile of a child

A creak Footsteps receding A click Michael turns on
the light Dafnas chair is empty Now with the light
on he sees a small picture on the wall at the kitchen
entrance A crumpled page from a notebook smoothed out
A plain frame A drawing in ink a ship sinking in
endless mud Its stern sunken its bow bursting out of
the mud a moment before the final immersion The
landscape is desolate and foggy The light gloomy and the
sky threatening

We come closer to the drawing and enter it

The soundtrack fades and dies an empty silence

Dafna sets a small tin box on the table in a sudden
movement Michael starts in fright momentarily
embarrassed by his weakness but she just looks at him
with the smile of a child who did something naughty and
says

DAFNA
I found this among his things In a
drawer

A tin lid with the faded picture of a mermaid A pair of
soft breasts and a fish’s tail Michael opens the lid A

dried marijuana blossom a used packet of rolling papers
and filters

DAFNA
Still remember how to roll

He smiles and starts rolling
Now Dafna is looking at the drawing She is quiet for a
long moment then says

DAFNA
The ship wont make it It will sink

MICHAEL
I dont think its sinking its
stuck But it wont make it I agree
with you on that
he is quiet for a moment
Maybe its better that it sinks

Silence

Dafna watches Michaels fingers as he rolls with
surprising skill

DAFNA
Impressed
Such a pro

MICHAEL
Some things you dont forget

DAFNA
Like swimming or riding a bicycle
Like the salty smell of the sea in
our rooftop apartment

He lights the joint She smokes is silent for a moment
then says

DAFNA
Like my sons birthday

A long camera move leaves them
A gentle breeze creeps into the soundtrack We come
closer to the drawing and enter into it

101 SIMPLE ANIMATION
The ship sounds its muffled siren starts sinking into

the mud A muffled bloop and the mud swallows it A
bubble of air bursts a last wisp of smoke The title THE

END rises from the horizon and goes out of the body of
the frame

102 INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

We come close to Michael He stares at the drawing and
smiles like a fascinated child

DAFNAS VOICE

Remember what the rabbi said at the
funeral

Michael detaches himself from the drawing and looks
toward her Her look becomes veiled her smile relaxed

DAFNA
(Continues while taking off her sweater
She is hot)
“Any IDF soldier whos killed
automatically becomes an angel

(Chuckles)
A cute angel that the fairies fight
over

(Laughs softly)
Hes probably partying now Hes
having aspiritual multi orgasm

Laughter Their laughter is quiet but relaxed

Suddenly Dafna gets up goes to the refrigerator removes

an envelope stuck on with a magnet and continues

DAFNA

(During her action)
Which reminds me were invited to a
ceremony at the Ministry of Defense
They engraved his name on some
memorial wall along with all the
other”fallen thats how they
call them It covers up the blood on
their suits

(Chuckles to herself)
There’s no mud there that’s for
sure But there’s no shortage of
blood

She takes the invitation out of the envelope and starts
reading out loud interspersed with giggles

DAFNA

You are hereby invited to attend the
unveiling ceremony of the name of
your son sergeant Jonathan Feldman
of blessed memory who fell during
the fulfillment of his duty See he
fell He didnt die or was killed
God forbid Fell barely got a
scratch

(Goes back to reading)
On the program Words from a
representative of the Ministry of
Defense A minutes silence The
unveiling The national anthem -
couldnt do without that And please
note coffee and cake

She sits down stares at the cake and says

DAFNA
Speaking of cake

She cuts the cake into slices One for him one for her
They eat in silence

DAFNA
(While eating)
Young men dont fall Someone pushes
them
The sound of a key in the door

ALMAS VOICE

(Off-cam)
You wont believe who sent me a
WhatsApp just now Ariel Yep Wait a
second

(Raises her voice)
Mom Im in a terrible hurry Make me
a sandwich with something

(Returns to her phone call)
Thinks hes like cool the Man

Crosses the entrance to the kitchen her eyes glued to
the cellphones screen enters-leaves the frame and talks
into her headset
ALMA
“Hi Alma Im here at Nanochka any
chance of you coming over

She stops abruptly A short silence

ALMA

Ill call you right back Bye
She returns to the kitchens entrance smiles and says

ALMA
Hi Dad

Michael smiles Now his face softens completely She
disarms him They have a moment of eye contact She looks
at Dafna questioningly Dafna smiles and shrugs

Alma continues to smile and says

ALMA
Youre smoking again

They deny with a smile Theyre in a cloud of smoke
Her smile widens

ALMA
Youve been smoking pot

They eat the cake and smile

ALMA
Youve been smoking and now youre
having the munchies

DAFNA
Want some

Offers her a slice of cake

Alma takes the cake and sits down on the free chair at
the table

They eat in smiling silence for a long moment

Dafna sees theyre enjoying it It makes her happy

The dog Max appears suddenly stops next to Dafna with a
begging look She gives him a slice and he wolfs it down
from her palm

A beep Alma lowers her eyes momentarily to her
cellphone gets up and says

ALMA
Got to run

She pours herself a third of a glass of water raises it
with a small gesture says

ALMA
To Jonathan

and downs it in one gulp She turns to leave stops for a
moment in the entrance and says

ALMA
You are beautiful when youre
together
(Smiles and disappears behind the door
frame)
Bye

The door closes Silence

DAFNA
(After a long silence)
I keep having the same dream
Dinner on a weekday me you Alma
and Jonathan

104A INTERIOR DINING AREA NIGHT

A round dining table MICHAEL DAFNA JONATHAN AND ALMA
eat

Jonathan with his back to us Dafna and Alma to either
side and Michael opposite him We approach the table in
a long slow movement lose Alma and Michael from the
frame and stay with Jonathan and Dafna Dafnas smile is
almost imperceptible but something shines out of her We
see her over Jonathans shoulder while he eats

Dafnas voice enters the soundtrack

DAFNAS VOICE

(VO continues)
Nothing really happens there
Jonathan eats Alma passes him the
salt Things like that normal
things But Im happy and dont
understand why I even ask myself
“Why do I suddenly feel so good” And
then I wake up and

Cut

105A INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT
DAFNA is silent for a moment then says

DAFNA
And lately when I dream about this
meal Im aware that Im in a drean
and instead of asking myself
questions I simply try to enjoy it

104B INTERIOR DINING AREA NIGHT

The camera moves closer to DAFNA and leaves JONATHANs
back out of the frame

DAFNAS VOICE

(VO cont)
But the more I accept that this is a
dream the more distant Jonathan
becomes Not physically I mean— hes
sitting beside me and I can almost
touch him But theres this sense of
endless distance a sense that hes
unattainable

105B INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

DAFNA looks down at the table
Her hand is near MICHAELs Almost touching it
She says
DAFNA
Thats why I never try to touch him
I dont want to do anything that
might make me wake up

106 INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

A long silence

Suddenly she starts crying but not dramatically A small
cry Quiet A moment shared with her crying

Michael smiles at her His smile is small and soft

She smiles back at him but the tears fall

His smile widens

She laughs a little but also cries a little Wipes the
tears on the sleeve of her sweater

DAFNA
Your confession for mine

Michael continues to smile and says nothing

DAFNA
(Spontaneously)
When I was sixteen I fell in love
with my father I fantasized I was
sleeping with him and it shocked me
(Smiles)
Your turn

MICHAEL
I didnt say I agreed

DAFNA
You did without saying it
Your turn

Michael takes a match out of the matchbox punches a hole
with it in the middle of the matchbox sticks the other
end into the pack of cigarettes and joins the two boxes

DAFNA
(smiling)
And in the finals of puzzle-solving
the winner is Michael Feldman 11

years old who completed a 5000
piece puzzle of Jerusalem in the
record time of

(turns questioning eyes to him)

MICHAEL
Six hours

Michael pulls out another match and sticks it into the
filter of a cigarette

MICHAEL
»-and one second
(Smiles)

DAFNA
(Laughs a little)
Six hours ladies and gentlemen The
Temple Mount is in our hands

MICHAEL
»-and one second

He joins the cigarette to the cigarette pack and within
half a minute of impressive handiwork a small tank sits
on the table between crumbs of cake whisky and an
ashtray filled with butts The pack is the body the
matchbox the turret and the cigarette the cannon
DAFNA smiles Her hand picks up the tank and her fingers
turn the turret (the matchbox attached to the cigarette
pack with the pivot made of a match)

DAFNA
(During her actions)
Wow
(with admiration mixed with irony)
Whenever you do anything you can be
relied on that it will work

DAFNA sets down the tank between herself and Michael
grasps the turret and turns it quickly The turret

completes two and some turns and stops with the cannon
(the cigarette) aimed at Michael

DAFNA
Truth or dare

MICHAEL
(After smiling hesitation)
Dare
DAFNA
Of course Okay I dare you next

time to say Truth

She turns the turret It spins and the cannon stops
almost opposite Michael She turns it a little to aim at
Michael Smiles

Michael smiles too and says nothing Just smiles
Silence

107A INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

MICHAEL begins to speak From time to time a frozen image
fills the screen like a short distant memory fragment

MICHAEL
On the first day of the Lebanon War
we drove on some dirt road My tank
was on the right and another tank
Yigals tank was on the left

He picks up his smartphone and sets it to the left of the
tank he built

I was the company commander
(turns the cannon of his tank to the
front)

Yigal was under my command

After a few minutes the road split
into two paths I was to take the one
on the right and Yigals tank was
supposed to take the one on the left
The route was planned and we each
knew where we were and which way
turn

But what happened was that just
before the split I slowed down and
signaled Yigal to cut in front of me
and take my path I can still
remember seeing him through the dust

107INSERT 1
Frozen image of Yigals gaze through the dust

MICHAELS VOICE
(VO over the picture)
I could see in his face that he
didnt understand what I was doing

Back to the kitchen

Michaels hand grasps the tank and moves it The tank
turns and overtakes the smartphone lying next to it

MICHAELS VOICE

(during these actions)
But I was the officer in charge his
commander So I cut in front of him
and got onto his path and he got
onto mine To this day I dont know
why I made that move
A few seconds later he hit a booby
trap and was blown up
Everyone there was screaming that
they were burning up I didnt have
the courage to come nearer I just
watched

108 INTERIOR KINDERGARTEN DAY FLASHBACK

MICHAEL THE CHILD stands in the corner

He is facing the wall his back to the other children in
the kindergarten

His face shows that he’s offended hurt and angry

In the soundtrack we hear childrens giggles

MICHAELS VOICE
(VO cont)
They screamed for a few minutes and
I just wanted them to die already I
couldnt stand the screaming anymore

The child looks down and sees a snail crawling across the
floor He covers it with his foot and slowly crushes it
107B INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

Back to Michaels CU

MICHAEL
Finally they died

Silence

Images (over the silence)

- A bunch of cheap plastic flowers

- Pictures of the Baba Sali and other righteous men
- A woman beaten and bent seated on a stool ina
narrow crowded kitchen

- A hospital bed in a small poor living room

We come closer to a young man with burns on his face
staring straight into the camera His gaze is direct and
quiet

MICHAELS VOICE

(Over the shot of the young man)
Only the gunner managed to pull
himself out but he was burned all
over A year later I went to visit
him Now he lives with his mother in
an apartment block He asked me what
happened to Yigal outside the turret
Why he suddenly turned into your
path thats what he said to me
Yours

Back to Michael in the kitchen

I told him what I told Yigals
parents that I didn’t know That he
cut in front of me That it happened
quickly Just like I said at the
inquiry after the war And to anyone
else who asked

MICHAEL

(After a long moment)
But the question haunted me Dafna
It was my first thought when I woke
up every morning my last thought
before I went to sleep Why did I do
this Why did I turn into his path
and send him to mine to die in my
place And then suddenly you got
pregnant It was like a sign that I
dont know that God is forgiving me
That its over That my nightmare is
over
And I couldnt let you give up on
Jonathan

DAFNA looks at him tenderly Her eyes glitter

MICHAEL
But you were wrong too Dafna When
you opened that window and were
flooded with the scent of the sea and
thought you are going to be happy
that you youre just at the
beginning Because that little moment
wasnt the beginning of a big true
happiness that was about to enter
into your life it was the happiness
itself A tiny moment thats all

109 INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

DAFNA
Lately Ive been listening to the
cassette full of love songs Remember
that tape that you made for me when
you fell in love with me and didnt
know how to say it

He smiles his eyes moist

She bends over slightly pushes the button on a cassette
player that sits on the corner of the table

Joe Cockers You are so beautiful in poor quality

110A INTERIOR-EXTERIOR VIEW FROM A MOVING VEHICLE
EARLY EVENING

The song plays on

View through the cab of the truck A narrow road and a
thick veil of fog

A long drive

A skinny cow suddenly appears from the fog standing on
the road staring at the truck hurtling towards her

104B EXTERIOR ROAD MUD AND FOG EARLY EVENING

Thick fog Slow motion The truck brakes with a screech
skids comes off the road and overturns We dont hear
the noises of the crash just the song The truck rolls
until it stops in the corner of the screen battered and
still

The cow is left standing on the road in the same spot
with the same indifferent look

The song continues
A dim orange sun peeks out from the fog

111 INTERIOR KITCHEN NIGHT

The song is in its last quarter

Michael and Dafna stand facing each other in the middle
of the kitchen close against each other barely moving
Just breathing each other in and embracing She strokes
his head and he shrinks into her embrace

The song ends They stay close together in an embrace
A long silent moment

MICHAEL
(In a whisper)
Theres a dance that goes like this
look
Takes one step forward and says

MICHAEL
Forward

Another step

MICHAEL
Forward

Half a step sideways and a quick close

MICHAEL
To the right and stop
Now the same but the opposite
backward backward to the left and
stop
Its simple you see No matter where
you go youll always end up exactly
where you started out
One two to the right and stop
Back two to the left and stop

They start dancing with endearing clumsiness Michael
whispers the beat for a few more moments then is still
They dance the foxtrot in silence

CUT to black

End
