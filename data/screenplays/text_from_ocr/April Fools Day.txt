FADE IN

EXT FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY

The sparkling waters The chirping spring day We are on an
isolated

stretch of country shore and a quiet sheltered island is
visible

distantly across the Sound There is asense of anticipation

excitement VOICES can be heard THE CAMERA is the POV of a
VIDEO

CAMERA and a group of college kids wait just os On-
screen however

for the moment a proper sweet-faced young COED faces the
camera and

-- reluctantly under the urging of her friend behind the
video lens -

- sets the scene

SWEET COED
(SHYLY)
Hi My name is Mary OReilly OToole OShea andover
there is the
island my friend Muffy owns Its spring break and

shes invited
us over for the weekend and were waiting for the ferry now
to take

(blushing mortified to cameraman)
I dont know what else to say

CAMERAMAN (CHAZS VOICE)

SWEET COED
Something about myself Oh Gee
(composing herself earnestly)

Well I want to work with handicapped children My parents

nothing to

CHAZS VOICE
Cmon Arch Skip

big good-natured easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew) and

Preppy the perfect image of the lazy spoiled indulged and
reckless
upper-crust kid Skip also happens to be Muffys cousin

ARCH
(ponders it with due consideration)
Yeah sure I fuck on the first date

Skip cracks up Archs laughter follows

NIKKI (0S)

again

He does finally shutting down the videopak The image
reverts to FILM

again

INT VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY

Cut TO
The driver -- a still great-looking turned-out Fairfield
County-type
SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger ROB FERRIS a cleancut

goodlooking 20 year old public school grad sit in
uncomfortable
silence on opposite ends of the front seat

ROB
(gestures awkwardly)
Herell be fine thanks

EXT HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAY

The Volvo wagon pulls over Rob drags out his daypack too
ROB
(ABASHED )

Thanks for the lift I mean

SUBURBAN LADY
(smiles no reason for disappointment)
It was a real lift for me too hon
A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection
turning off the

highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going
A road

sign indicates BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT in another
direction

Rob hefts his gear hurrying to flag the sedan

The Volvo wagon continues on braking for the next
undergraduate
male hitchhiking down the road

INT KITCHEN - ST JOHN HOUSE- DAY

CLOSE ON a wall calendar A HAND reaches INTO FRAME tearing
off

MARCH to begin APRIL

WIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA the middle-aged housekeeper and
offseason

caretaker for the house With her overcoat and purse on one
arm she

drops the MARCH calendar page in a wastebasket then
crosses to the

pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the
basement

CLARA
(CALLING)
The rooms are all in order double- and triple-checked and
Im on my
way

She hears a CLATTER from down below
INT BASEMENT - DAY

MUFFY ST JOHN drags a womans body across the floor The
arm comes
off in her hand

MUFFY
Shit

CLARAS VOICE
Need any help down there

Clara comes clopping down the steps Muffy turns the
mannequins arm

still in her hand Old workclothes and a head kerchief take
the place

of Muffys normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit
(including
the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust Early 20s
pretty in
an off-beat sort of way Muffy is every inch a blue-blood

MUFFY
(puffing with the effort)
No Clara thanks Just trying some last minute
straightening down

here god I dont think Ive ever worked so hard in my
life
CLARA
Sure you dont want me to stay Theres nobody gonna be
around

here to help till first ferry back Monday yknow

MUFFY
(continuing with her work)
Nope youre a peach Clara But this ones mine I told my
father Id
do it and I will My way I dont want him to have any

excuses
CLARA
(dubiously turning to go)
All right then Have a nice party
MUFFY
(a buoyant laugh)
Nice It has to be better than nice its gotta be bloody
unforgettable
Clara climbs the stairs
CLARA
Good luck
MUFFY (CONT)
Bye Clara See you Monday
Soon theres the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing
behind
Clara
Muffy finally props the mannequin clearing away the
remaining
clutter She goes to open a basement window for ventilation
It isa
ground-level transom hinged at the top Through it Clara is
visible

departing the grounds
Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING She turns hesitating and
follows the
sounds

INT UTILITY ROOM

Part of the basement an old washroom and more with tub
slop sink

and large incinerator Muffy enters pulling the chain on
the bare

overhead bulb It illuminates the room and the tub
underneath --

slightly rusty at the drain but otherwise spotless -- and
the slowly

dripping faucet

EXT FERRY LANDING - MAINLAND - DAY

CHAZ the videocameraman and the only member of the group we
havent
seen till now is the first to spot the ferry approaching

CHAZ
Here she comes

Hes a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass a free
spirit in

neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt He shoulders his
lightweight

videopak again taping it Arch and Skip watch with him from

the end

of the pier But Kit and Nikki waiting nearer the office
are

distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car

ANGLE - PARKING LOT

Its not Rob though Its NAN another newcomer She pulls
her car

next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing
office and -

gets out quickly dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back
seat She

is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy earnest
small-town

girl overdressed for the occasion

appeal
ARCH

passes them giving first Skip and then the others a look

her head in sad appraisal
FERRYMAN (cont)

NIKKI
(SUGGESTIVE )

Your flys open and your Hostess Twinkies hanging out

The assistant gapes falling for it groping his fly Which

of course He looks up grinning Chaz kisses him on the

KIT
(URGENTLY)
Excuse me But were still waiting for somebody --

FERRYMAN
(GRUFFLY)
Its Friday My last run of the week I dont get paid
KIT
But youve got to wait They said its the only way over
If he misses this

Arch WHISTLES loudly seeing and alerting them

PARKING LOT - THEIR POV
A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning

highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot Rob hurries out a
comes up from the group on the ferry Kit closes her eyes in
Rob comes hurrying up the ramp

ANGLE LANDING
followed closely by HARVEY HAL EDISON JR

HARVEY
Wait up

Harvey is the driver of the sedan and after he carefully

he

comes running with his bag too He is a rangy straight-

League farmboy from the Border South and hes the last of

invited guests He also somewhat incongruously sports a

Springsteen badge

(to Kit kissing her)
Sorry Nik Chaz

Rob Ferris

They return greetings

HARVEY
(RIGHT BEHIND )

Harve
HARVEY
(correcting him blithely)

(noticing interest his badge)
Springsteen hes still the Boss

FERRYMAN
(IMPATIENTLY)
Ok cmon I dont have all day

He slams the stile down after Harvey the last to board and

gets busy
with the stubborn motor His assistant helps Chaz tapes

(enthusiastically putting down his fear)

(MEANING SKIP)

HARVEY

SKIP
Distant Over the horizon

Old money never mixes family with friends

NIKKI
This is true For as long as Ive known her

KIT
(JOKING)
To protect her family I guess
SKIP
(UNSMILING)
To keep her friends

He turns to Arch holds up his hand and CLICK a

switchblade opens
into the lens

CHAZ
(undaunted to Rob)
Your flys open

He keeps the tape rolling Rob discreetly looks down His

open Kit looks at him dubiously Rob zips Chaz beams

getting it all

for posterity The engine finally engages The ferry

ROB
(smiles weakly to Kit)

They are indeed
EXT THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAY
The ferry pulls away from the mainland
EXT THE FERRY - DAY
A CLOSER ANGLE The sturdy barge like ship craft makes
The
Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern
ECU - THE DECK
As Skips knife flies INTO FRAME it bites into the boards
SKIP AND ARCH
at their game Arch stretches cant reach the knife and
over

Skip hoots triumphantly

SKIP

NIKKI AND HARVEY
Nikki much to her chagrin finds herself the object of

attentions

CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE

digging into the deck again

ARCH (0S)
Jesus

ARCH and SKIP
The knife is at an impossible distance
SKIP

(LAUGHING)
Go for it big fella
Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt

CHAZ
fastens onto Nan immersed in one of her books He carries
his own

CHAZ
(sitting beside her)
Whatcha readin

NAN

English epic Its a shame Its a dying form Not too

many people

CHAZ
(SHOWS HER)
Suck and fuck

Naked bodies writhing in heat Women with their tongues
sticking out

in desparate desire Nan tries to control her reaction to
his stack

of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines

CHAZ (CONT)
The origins of American pornographic film Im taking an
independent study this term
(the passion and commitment show)
My advisors really behind me on it Were not gonna be

sheltered
college kids all our lives Someday Im gonna have kids --
youre gonna have kids and someday that kids gonna come up
to me and say God Dad porns really a major part of our
lives You were there howd it get started I wanna be
able to answer their questions
(SMILES)
Besides its research I can do by myself
ROB AND KIT
They keep their voices low
KIT
(STILL MIFFED)
Thats not my point --
ROB
You dont want me to hitch you want me to buy a car OK
but

Im a state university boy I dont have the perks like some
of you private college kids do
KIT
Oh cmon dont pull that

Rob just drops his arms in frustration

KIT (cont)
I mean it may show something about your attitude toward me
always being late

ROB
Kit

Archs voice interrupts

ARCHS VOICE
(annoyed loudly overriding the other conversations)
Hey Im really not interested anymore --

SKIP
Cmon just one more

The others look up at the interruption
ANGLE

Arch pushes the knife back into Skips hand tired of
playing knife-
toss

ARCH
I said enoughs enough--

SKIP
One more try double or nothing

He flips the knife to Arch handle first

ARCH
(PISSED OFF)
Cmon give it a fuckin rest

He flips it back hard Something happens Skip looks up
stunned
Archs voice catches in his throat in horror
ANOTHER ANGLE

Skip stares back disbelieving looking down and pulling his
hand away

from his chest where the blood begins to seep and the
jackknife

sticks out buried hilt-deep between his ribs
SKIP

(PALE)
Oh fuck
SKIP
Nan screams Skip stumbles teetering there at the edge of
the ferry
Rob and Chaz leap to their feet The ferrymen both look up
in

disbelief Arch steps forward to help But Skip weaving
topples and
splashes overboard He goes under

ARCH
(panicked hurrying to the side)
Ill get him Ill get him

But he stops just at the edge of the ferry immobilized by
fear

Rob rushes forward with Chaz in reserve pulling Arch out
of ‘the

way But Buck the assistant ferryman pre-empts them all
diving in

Arch frozen watches from the deck with the others
Buck resurfaces but without any sign of Skip Rob doesnt

wait any
longer He pulls off his shoes and dives in Chaz gets ready

to follow
suit The panic mounts Suddenly
SKIPS VOICE
Hi this what youre looking for
THEY TURN
ANGLE CHANGE
Skip pulls himself up dripping on the other side of the
ferry He
holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt
he used to
imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear The others
stare

totally freaked

Arch lets go jumping in the air Rob and Buck surface to
see as
well
jerks

impressed

ARCH

We got em Whoo-ee did we nail ‘em
CHAZ
(as it dawns to Skip)
April Fools you crazy jerks You crazy motherfuckin

somebody couldve gotten hurt out there

Relief descends Rob isnt laughing But nobodys more
than
assistant Buck still treading water

BUCK
(GRINNING)
SH-I-I-I-T

NIKKI
You maniacs you almost gave us a heart attack

Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out
ARCH

(TO CHAZ)
Well at least we dont go in for this your-shoelaceis-—

untied crap

ROB
(dripping to Arch and Skip)
I owe you one

SKIP
(smiles to Buck in the water)
Hows it goin out there

BUCK
That was great

SKIP
I was really counting on these other turkeys to save
my ass

CHAZ
Oh too bad

Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out

SKIP
Sorry about that

But Bucks in no hurry The ferryman steps forward

FERRYMAN
(unamused to Buck)
Ok cmon get out

They are approaching the landing dock on the island
FERRYMAN (CONT )

(to Buck gruffly)

Cmon Im gonna need some help here

Buck obeys but his way enjoying it ducking under the

craft to swim

suddenly

to the other side to help

FERRYMAN (CONT)
And watch out for the wire

Too late Theres a sickening THUMP I The young assistant

breaks the surface qf the water panicked and stunned

gasping for

thrashes

as it

one of

screaming

air
It happens too fast for any of them to do anything Buck
dazed off-balance falling back into the path of the ferry
glides toward the landing

FERRYMAN
Buck look out--

ROB
(IN DREAD)
Oh shit
The ferryman grabs the controls but it cant help
The ferry unstoppable plows into Buck pinning him against

the piers Buck screams

FERRYMAN
Buck

The ferryman rushes forward to help

For a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the
Ferrymans back blocks their view

But then Buck thrashing in the water tears himself loose

and bobbing up his head and torso covered in blood the

side of his
cries and

comes

shore

face and his shoulder hideously deformed
It is awful It is ghastly And it is unforgettable
KIT
(IN HORROR)
Oh god
EXT DOCK - ISLAND - DAY
SAM POTTER the middle-aged township constable hears the
the screams He drops what hes doing in his outboard and
running
EXT LANDING - ISLAND - DAY

The ferryman jumps into the shallow water pulling Buck onto

Rob Chaz and Arch jump after to help but the ferryman

pushes them

from his

at them

use The

One

group

angrily away

FERRYMAN
Get away from him

Buck is hysterical The gashes of torn flesh seem to drip

skull Seeing Rob and the others he screams lunging vainly

in agony
BUCK
They did it them
FERRYMAN
(RESTRAINING HIM)
Easy Buck its OK OK Theres time for
Later easy

But its hard for him to restrain his own rage

Constable Potter arrives throwing the ferryman a towel to

ferryman catches it pressing it against Bucks torn face

maddened glaring eye still stares out hideously at the
CONSTABLE POTTER

(TO -‘FERRYMAN)
Get him to the hospital Cal Take my boat
He helps the ferryman lift Buck But the powerful ferryman
needs no
further help carrying Buck to the Constables motorboat

moored

nearby laying Buck in untying the line and pulling the
motor to

life Buck continues to shriek terrifyingly

The ferryman cast one last glance back

EXT THE LANDING

The SOUND of the motorboat fades away Potter turns back to
the

stunned group eyeing them

CONSTABLE POTTER
All right Lets have it
INT MUFFYS PASSENGER VAN - DAY

Muffy drives up She slows seeing through the windshield
the somber

scene at the pier her friends in troubled conversation
with

Constable Potter

EXT LANDING - DAY

Muffy gets out parking the new van beside an old island
pick-up which

is kept at the dock Shes clean and dressed in her more
usual preppy

garb She approaches

MUFFY
Whats going on Sam whats wrong

CONSTABLE POTTER
(IN DISGUST)
Tricks Pranks Better ask your friends Bucks been hurt
Cal just
took him on over to the mainland Just lucky I was here

She returns his stare in dread silence He boards the ferry
CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT )
I came over to check on a report of some unauthorized

activity in the area Your dad around

She startles the question 50 unanticipated
MUFFY
No hes in Sutton Place Why

CONSTABLE POTTER
No word from him or anybody else

MUFFY
(STILL PUZZLED)
No

He tries the engine Nothing

CONSTABLE POTTER
Just like I thought Burned out Worthless

He steps back onto the shore

CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT )
Ill have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore

MUFFY
We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen but I
think theres an extra one underneath the cushion there
She points to the boat seat Potter is much obliged

EXT ROAD - DAY

CONSTABLE POTTER
(to the others sternly)
Im glad youre stuck here all o you If theres anvthin
else or
anything happens to Buck I want to know where to find
you

The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest
From what

we can see of its occupants the mood is pretty grim Behind
it the

old island pick-up truck follows

INT PICK-UP

Rob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab Nobody
says

anything Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell
Finally he

reaches over to roll down his window but the handle rotates
uselessly

in his grip

SKIP
These goddamn windows
He starts banging violently on the door on the window

SKIP
Theyve never been fixed

KIT
Look Skip it wasnt your fault It was an accident You
didnt know

SKIP
(BITTER)
Sure

He leaves off his banging Pause

ROB
(SIGHS)
What a way to start a weekend huh

SKIP
Muffy Nothing bad ever happens to her

EXT ST JOHN HOUSE DAY

It is a truly grand affair two stories at least rambling
and
picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds garage and
outbuildings Muffy gets out first hopping around to the
back to open
the rear van gate for the bags Nan beholds the house for
the first
time
NAN
(OVERWHELMED )
Oh Muffy

Rob pulls the pick-up right behind them
INT ENTRY HALL - DAY
As they come in with their bags

MUFFY

living room

INT LIVING ROOM

CHAZS VOICE
(from the dining room)
Wow look at this

INT DINING ROOM
The others enter to see what Chazs shout is all about

Chaz stands before a large beautifully polished dining
table that is

set for each of them -- each place carefully marked with a
name card

and a Ken or Barbie doll with the persons name on it The
settings
themselves are idiomatic and economical -- plastic spoon-

and-fork
combination sets and paper cups plates napkins etc
CHAZ
(in mock awe)
Look Our very own place settings with our very own place
cards -- with Ken or Barbie Outasight
NAN
(GIGGLES )

NIKKI

NAN
(meaningfully with her Barbie)
I used to have all her outfits

CHAZ
Dont anybody move
Chaz jumps back from the table whipping out his videocam to
record
the moment and panning them all at - their respective
places

CHAZ (CONT)
One of us in this room
(bellowing a mystery laugh)
-pulls his wang

He ends the pan on Arch who gives him the finger

A door opens and Harvey steps through looks back over his
and enters He is just snooping around He surveys the
framed diplomas on the walls along with autographed photos
presidents and other heads of state

He steps over to the desk opens a cigar box sitting there

a cigar and slips it into his pocket
EXT BACK LAWN - SUNSET

Arch and Chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound

EXT VERANDA - THE SAME
Abroad veranda which runs along the entire length of the
back of the

house Skip and Nan are sitting on the railing gazing over
the

sounds Skip has a drink

ON NAN

As soon as her ass hits the seat she lets slip an
outrageous fart
She springs to her feet her face turning beet red

THE GROUP

All conversation stops each person looking for the guilty
party Nan

discreetly sits back down but again as soon as her tail
meets the

chair another blast escapes her

All eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out
a whoopee
cushion

NAN
You guys

Everybody laughs

KIT
So its going to be one of those dinners huh

a large oil portrait with the eyes out out Something is

Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall
Behind it is an
inset bookcase Sitting on one of the shelves at the proper

height to

have lined up with the holes in the portrait is a childs

forth

like a pendulum marking seconds

They sit in silence for a moment making no move to join
each other in
the middle of the bed

Ouch Jesus

chair collapses beneath him

EXT BACK PATH - NIGHT

Skip makes his way boldly carelessly drunkenly along
Overgrown
weeds and tall spring grass choke the path shadowing his

way He

takes one last drink killing the bottle and hurls it out
into the

night

After a long pause there is the distant sound OS of the
bottle

landing in water with a splash
EXT OLD BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Skip emerges from the overgrowth The abandoned old
structure and its

dock squat ahead at waters edge Beneath the boathouse
floating in

the water is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp

Skip turns away from the dock and flicks his lighter among
the weeds

finding marijuana growing there He CACKLES with triumph

Something MOVES nearby He doesnt pay attention taking out
his knife

to cull the dried leaves He cups them in his hand against
the wind

douses his lighter and hurries out onto the dock to the
boathouse

entrance to prepare his joint

slowly along a wall away from the door Then he becomes
another living presence in the boathouse It is a slow

sound--completely inhuman

SKIP
Hello

ing

sound very near like a foot striking the wood flooring

SKIP
Whos there

Pause No answer We hear in the darkness the sound of his

switchblade

powerful

against hi

clicking open And then he waits straining his ears to
Finally Skip reaches into his pocket puils out his lighter
and flicks it on

Something snags him from behind

Skip gasps helpless as a thick rope controlled by
shadowed

hands tightens around his neck

His knife dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor

Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest
with
special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and
Nikki

Up on the porch Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the
distant tool

shed Muffy is dressed plainly oddly conventional with a
perceptible

sense of disorder about her She keeps to herself turning
toward the

woods beyond with cutting blade and mushroom basket in
hand

Nan puts down her book hurrying off the porch But by the
timeshe

looks up again Muffy is gone

and

gently lovingly dries his back She finishes and he steps
away from

her and gazes out across the sound

Rob runs down to Skips door and flings it open A cheap
hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him suspended from the
on frail metal springs

Rob jumps back with a startled cry then angrily tears the
of his way and throws it down

This is the last of Muffys little April Fools gags and as
overnight bag it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near
this room

But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure
The room is untouched the bed unslept in

He beats a hasty retreat the other way passing Nikki on her

Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy misinterpreting the

tension in the

clear the

the

air

Muffy exits hurriedly upset

EXT WOODS - DAY

The path is narrow and tortuous Arch uses his club to

way

trying to follow its twists and turns He also tries to make

contact

ARCH
Hey shithead chickendick yeah you Skip

He moves deeper and deeper into the forest
LOW ANGLE
Up ahead on the pathway a thick black viper slithers out of

undergrowth stops sensing Archs presence and coils

itself against
his approach

WIDER
as Arch stalks forward not looking at the ground

LOW ANGLE

Arch steps right over the snake and continues on

nearby

He turns and moves back along the trail peering into the
dense
foliage on either side

He stops again looks all around him then turns once more
and starts

to move very slowly with short little steps back in the
other

direction

ARCH
Skip

LOW ANGLE
He is edging closer and closer to the snake He is bound to
step on it
this time

The snake coils itself to strike

Archs foot comes down just missing it less than six inches
away
when suddenly the ground seems to move A noose springs up
tightens

around his ankle and Arch is lifted into the air upside
down

swinging wildly dropping his club

Now the viper strikes and Arch sees it He is shrieking
with horror

as he tries to bat the creature away from him But he keeps
swinging

into it and the snake keeps striking at him trying to find
an

opening

Suddenly a long gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the
snake in
two

Arch looks up his face white and frozen into a mask of
sheer terror

no longer able even to scream

Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs Rob suddenly
bumps
into something someone there He screams aloud dropping

enclosing them within itself

Though they

can see Potters boat rocking gently in the water moored to
the dock

they cannot make out any sign of the Constable

(in guarded approach)
Constable Mr Potter
No answer The silence is chilling They proceed out onto

ROB
(WHISPERING)

If theres another flare we can signal him

KIT
Maybe he went on to the house

Rob unlashes the mooring grabbing hold of the line to pull
in It wont budge the line snagged in the water where it
Rob tugs harder freeing something to the surface

from the wall and drops it jumping back just as MUFFYS
HEAD rolls

forward from a shelf behind the painting right into Kits

trying to get rid of it

Suddenly a loud NOISE slams at the basement window Rob
grabs Kit

covering her mouth and snapping off the flashlight The
head falls to

the floor at their feet They turn

because of
the prank

Kit is nearest to him and without warning he lunges at her
and
buries a knife into her stomach ‘up to the handle

stabs her

again and again and again plunging the knife deep into her
with

every thrust
