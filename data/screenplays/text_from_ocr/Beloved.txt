It is winter in Ohio A house sits isolated beside a barren
field The field stretches beyond until a line of distant
woods stops it Around the back of the house stands a rundown
STORAGE SHED a cold house a privy and a water pump A porch
with a single door serves as the only entrance

Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we

a small bag of belongings

HOWARD

Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howards hand as the latter
runs into the kitchen Alone he edges towards the front
door when suddenly

THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on its own Scared he steps
away slowly

affection and pained longing He wants to take her

HOWARD

DENVER
Bye Bul
Bulgar is starting to cry He rushes up the steps and hugs
his sister He kisses her hard then breaks away Denvers
outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air

Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124 into a
Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom

hums her melody softly sadly with a resigned understanding
of why her boys are running awayand a deep pain that is
too constant to notice

INT BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY
BABY SUGGS grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe sits in
her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREENIt is the
only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding Suggs is
bed-ridden exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of
suffering and sacrifice and tested faith

BABY SUGGS
Ya know what Id love to see I loved to
see me some lavender You got any
lavender Or even pink - pinkll do

Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser She stops and

checks her pockets for rags or swatchesShe looks around
the room
SETHE
No Sorry
BABY SUGGS

Ah winter in Ohio is especially rough if
youve got an appetite for color

Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until

SETHE (OS)
Oh wait

Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at
her Suggs smiles

BABY SUGGS
Oh thats fine Fine

Sethe lets out a small laugh She walks toward the window
stretching her body Her expression changes as she thinks of
her boys Baby Suggs reads her like a book

BABY SUGGS
Theyll be all right Im surprised they
lasted here this long

SETHE
I dont know Maybe we should have moved

BABY SUGGS
Whatd be the point Not a house in the
country aint packed to the rafters with
some dead Negros grief We lucky our
ghost is a baby My husband spirit come
back Or yours Dont talk to me HaYou
lucky You got one child left still
pullin at your skirts Be thankful I had
eight Eight with six fathers Every one
of them gone from me Four taken four

somebodys house into evil My first born
- alls I can remember of her now is how
she loved the burned bottom of bread Her
little handsI wouldnt knowem if they
slapped me Can you beat that Eight
children and thats all I remember

SETHE
(returning to her work)
You remember Halle

BABY SUGGS
Oh I remember bits and pieces of all
oftem I guessHalle of courseI had
Halle a lifetime Almost twenty years
My two girls sold and gone before I
could even a heard about it and them
without their grown up teeth yet My
third child my son after HalleI let
that straw boss have me for four months
sos I could keep that boy Next year he
had him traded for lumber anyway and me
pregnant with his child I couldnt love

SETHE
The boys wouldnt have left if Halle were

BABY SUGGS

fq

Those boys didnt even know him You had
six whole years of marriage to my Halle
Fathered every one of your children A
blessing I learned hard that a mans

Hallenow thats somebody

Sethes mixed feelings show all over her face Although she
loved Halle there is clearly something unresolved in her

SETHE
Just got a few more things to do then
Ill start supper

Sethe exits
EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - LATE DAY
Denver is playing in the front yard by herself
Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing A

gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket Sethe sees it
floating atop the water for a moment then picks it up

CU of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the
feeling a memory - from long ago

Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in
the barren field of 124but rather-

MEMORY
EXT SWEET HOME - LATE DAY

A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating
down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as
the eye can see Sethes figure dwarfed by the majestic
landscape

Sethe looks frightened Her breathing grows shallow She
hears something

THE SOUND OF A WAGONS WHEELS - rolling over a road growing
louder coming towards her

INTERCUT

CU OF A WAGON WHEEL MOVING RAPIDLY ON A ROAD CAMERA PANS
UP TO THE MAN DRIVING THE WAGON - A STERN WHITE MAN WEARING A
DISTINCTIVE HAT

SETHE TURNS away from the sycamores towards the road to see
END OF MEMORY
EXT 124 BLUESTONE - LATE DAY

A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the
back coming up Bluestone Road He wears no hat

Sethe breathes easily She looks around her -the reality of
124s barren field has returned The memory of Sweet Homes
sycamores have vanished

Denver is playing near the road As the wagon nears 124
Denver looks up and smiles The Man whips the horse hard so
as to ride past the house faster The children stare at
Denver and 124 with horror and curiosity
The stares of the children destroy Denvers smile She
watches them go then turns to hide her upset and sees her
mother watching her

Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence wanting to
ease her daughters pain and knowing full well she cannot

Hurt and angry Denver runs past Sethe towards the woods
EXT WOODS - LATE DAY

Denver runs with a purpose knowing exactly where she is
going

She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring The tall
bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground
forming a round emerald room in the center seven feet high
with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves

This is Denvers private place She bends low and crawls
through the leaves into the center Once there this lonely
child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself
together She lays her face against the cool earth

INT 124 BLUESTONE RD - NIGHT

Denver walks to her room in her night dress She passes the
opened door of her mothers bedroom and peeks in

INT SETHES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sethe kneeling by her bed as if praying

Beside Sethe A WHITE DRESS KNEELS as well with its sleeve
around Sethes waist Like two friendly grown-up women
comforting each other in prayer

Denver tip toes away

INT DENVERS ROOM - NIGHT

Sethe enters to check on Denver whom she thinks is asleep
She leans over and kisses her forehead only to discover she
is awake

DENVER
Mama

SETHE
What is it baby
DENVER
You think maybe when daddy comes he
could talk to the baby ghost Maybe make
her behave and then people wont be
scared of here no more

SETHE
I dont know

DENVER
Why wont she ever settle

SETHE
Shes mad like a baby gets mad You
forgetting how little it is She wasnt
even two years old when she died Too
little to understand

DENVER
For a baby she throws a powerful spell

SETHE
No more powerful than the way I loved her

Hearing her mother say this moves Denver

DENVER
What do you pray for Mama

SETHE
Oh I dont really pray anymore I just
talk

DENVER

About what

SETHE
Oh about time How some things go Pass
on Some things just stay

DENVER
What things

SETHE
Like the place I was at before here -
Sweet Home Even if that whole farm and
every tree and blade of grass on it died -
itll still be there Waiting And if you
go and stand in the place where it was
what happened there once will happen
again
DENVER
If its still there waiting that mean
nothing ever dies

SETHE
Nothing ever does Thats why I had to
get my children out No matter what
Thats why you can never go there

DENVER
You never tell me all what happened Just
that they whipped you and you run off
pregnant with me

SETHE
You dont need to know nothing else

DENVER
(nods)
I saw a white dress kneeling next to you
when you was praying

SETHE
White Maybe it was my bedding dress
Describe it to me

DENVER
Had a high neck Whole mess of buttons
coming down the back

SETHE
Buttons Well thats not my bedding
dress I never had a button on nothing
What else

DENVER
A bunch at the back On the sit down
part

SETHE
A bustle

DENVER
I dont know what its called

SETHE
You say it was holding on to me How

DENVER
Kneeling next to you while you were
praying I mean talking It looked just
like you
SETHE
Well Ill be

DENVER
I think it was a sign I think maybe
babys got plans

SETHE
What plans

DENVER
I dont know but that dress holding onto
you got to mean something

SETHE
Maybe Maybe it does

Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child They hear
a sound in the house - floor boards creaking

DENVER
Shes crawling again

Sethe nods and holds her daughters hand as they listen

FADE OUT
SUPER 1873

FADE IN
EXT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY
CU - PAUL D GARNER
Paul stands on the road gazing up at the house Grateful
hes arrived cautious about what hell find he steps
towards the porch His clothes are ragged His feet sore and
blistering in his shoes
EXT THE PUMP - DAY
Off to the side of the house Sethe washes her feet and legs
at the pump She looks up and sees Pauls figure walking
towards the house The sun blazes in her eyes She cant make
out who it is or whether or not hes even real As he
reaches the porch Paul disappears from view
Sethe walks towards the front of the house When she is

little more than forty feet away she stops - still not
certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past
SETHE
Paul Paul D Is that you

PAUL
(smiles)
Whats left
(He rises)
How you been girl besides barefoot

Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket She
smiles like a little girl not able to believe her eyes

SETHE
You looking good

PAUL
Devils confusion He lets me look good
long as I feel bad

SETHE
How long has it been

PAUL
Bout eighteen years I figure

SETHE
Eighteen years

PAUL
And I swear I been walking every one of
them Mind if I join you

He begins taking off his shoes

SETHE
You want to soak them Let me get you
some water

PAUL
No uh uh Cant baby feet A whole more
tramping they got to do yet

SETHE
Youre not leaving right away are you
You stay awhile

PAUL
Well long enough to see Baby Suggs
youWhere is she

SETHE
Dead

PAUL
Aw no When

SETHE
Eight years now Almost nine

PAUL
Was it hard I hope she didnt die hard

SETHE
Soft as cream Being alive was the hard
part Sorry you missed her though Is
that what you came by for

PAUL
Thats some of what I came for The rest
is you

Sethe doesnt know what to do with her eyes when he says
thisshe looks away instinctively Paul realizes that may
have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs

PAUL
The truth be known I go anywhere these
days Anywhere they let me sit down

SETHE
Come on inside

PAUL
Porch is fine Cool out here Sit with
me

Like a nervous little girl Sethe takes a sit beside a man
for the first time in years folding her sweat stained skirt
beneath her

PAUL
So Baby Suggs is gone Somehow never
thought death would find her

SETHE
It finds everyone

PAUL
We managed well enough without meeting
it

SETHE

I suppose
Awkward pause Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult
question - but one that is foremost in her mind

SETHE
I wouldnt have to ask about him would
IYoud tell me if there was anything
to tell wouldnt you

Paul knows instantly she is asking about Halle

PAUL
You know I would But I dont know any

more about what happened to Halle now
than I did then

Something about Pauls expression might suggest hes keeping
something from her He turns his gaze outward as he says

PAUL
You must think hes still alive

SETHE
No I think hes dead Its just not
being sure that keeps him alive

PAUL
What did Baby Suggs think

SETHE
Same Ha listen to her all her children
dead and she felt each one go the very
day and hour it happened

PAUL
When she say Halle went

SETHE
1855 Same day my baby was born

PAUL
You had that baby did you Damn never
thought youd make it Running off
pregnant

SETHE
Had to Couldnt be no waiting

PAUL
All by yourself too

SETHE
Almost A white girl helped me

PAUL
Then she helped herself God bless her

Awkward silence

SETHE
We got spare rooms You could stay the
night if you had a mind to

PAUL
You dont sound too steady in the offer

SETHE
Oh itsits truly meant I just hope
youll pardon my house

Paul smiles a warm touched smile that after all that theyve
survived Sethe is worried about what hell think of her
home

PAUL
My house I like the sound of that

Sethe smiles then rises to escort him in
INT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY

Sethe opens the front door and enters with Paul behind her
hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder As he
follows her in

A POOL OF RED UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him It worries
him

PAUL
You got company

SETHE
On and off

The light undulates faster and faster extending all the way
to the kitchen at the end of the hall Frightened Paul steps
back out the door

PAUL
Good God What kind of evil you got in
there

SETHE

Its not evilIts justjust sad Come
on Just step through

Sethe reaches out her hand Paul tentatively takes it and is
lead through the red light of the hallway through to the
itchen where it ends

As he walks through we can see Paul affected by the light
t is sad A sadness that touches him welling up inside
until tears are brimming in his eyes He reaches the normal
light of the kitchen and steps out of it

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone

PAUL
I thought you said she died soft as cream

SETHE
(busying herself in kitchen)
Oh thats not Baby Suggs Thats my
daughter The one I sent ahead with the
boys before I run off

PAUL
She didnt live

SETHE
No

PAUL
The boys too

SETHE
No they alive - they run off before Baby
Suggs died The one I was carrying when I
left Sweet Home is all I got left

Still affected by the light Paul eases himself down at the
table finding something to say

PAUL
Well probably bestIf a Negro boy got
legs he ought to use them Sit down too
long somebody figure out a way to tie

(the image disturbs Sethe)
You by yourself then

SETHE
Me and Denver my daughter
PAUL
No man
(Sethe shakes head no)
And thats all right by you

SETHE
Its all right by meI cook at a
restaurant in town Sew a little on the
sly

She places a bottle and a glass on the table before him The
light jarred him He snatches the bottle to drink and calm
himself down She jokes

SETHE
You look more done in by a walk through
my front hall than all those eighteen
years of walking put together

PAUL
Got that right

INT SECOND FLOOR OF 124 - MORNING

Denver all of eighteen years old now and beautiful is
buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down
in the kitchen She stops Her face lights up

DENVER
Daddy

She runs down the white staircase
INT KITCHEN - MORNING
As Denver runs into the kitchen we hear

SETHE (OS)
Wont you stay a little while Cant
nobody catch up on eighteen years ina
day

Denver appears expectantly down the white staircase that
leads from the second floor She looks at Paul wide eyed
They turn to her with gentle smiles

SETHE
Baby this heres Paul D GarnerPaul

the Sweet Home men

Denvers heart sinks
PAUL
Good morning Miss Denver Its a
pleasure

DENVER
Good morning Mr D

PAUL

PAUL

DENVER
You knew my father

PAUL
Knew him Knew him well

SETHE
Of course he did I told you hes from
Sweet Home Paul may stay with us a
while Wont that be nice having an old
friend stay a spell

But Denver reacts with surprise and dismay Paul is not her
friend Paul right now is more of an intruder

PAUL
If thats all right with you that is

DENVER
We have a ghost here you know

PAUL
We met But sad your mama said Not
evil

DENVER

No sir not evil But not sad either

PAUL

DENVER

SETHE
I dont see how it could be lonely
spending every minute with us like it
does

DENVER
Its my sister She was just a baby when
she died in this house

PAUL
Reminds me of that headless bride back
behind Sweet Home Remember that Sethe
Used to roam them woods regular

DENVER
(annoyed resentful)
Mama doesnt like talk about Sweet Home
Says it was never sweet and it sure
wasnt home

SETHE
Girl mind yourself

PAUL
Now now she got it right there Sethe

SETHE
But its where we were All together
Its where I met your father And it
comes back on us whether we want it to or
not

DENVER
Then why dont you ever tell me about it

Sethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denvers challenge

SETHE
Denver start up the stove Paul must be
hungry

PAUL

Dont go to no trouble on my account

SETHE

Breads no trouble The rest I brought
back from where I work Least I can do
cooking dawn to noon is bring dinner
home You got any objections to pike

PAUL

If he dont object to me I dont object
to him

He addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response She

crosses to the stove and works on lighting it

DENVER

Wheres he going to sleep Baby Suggs
room got no sheets or nothing

SETHE

Well figure it out

DENVER

Maybe you should stay with mama Mr
Garner Then you two can talk about Sweet
Home all night long

SETHE

(explodes)

Whats the matter with you I never knew
you to behave like this

Leave her be Sethe Im a stranger to her

PAUL

SETHE

Thats just it She got no cause to act
up with a stranger

Denver collapses where she stands sobbing out loud

moves to her

Baby

SETHE
what is it Did something happen

Denver moves away Sethe registers this rejection

DENVER

I cant no more I cant no more

SETHE

Cant what What cant you

DENVER

I cant live here I dont know where to
go or what to do but I cant live here
Nobody speaks to us Nobody comes by
Nobody even knows Im alive

Shes mad

Sethe
PAUL
What she talking about nobody speaks to

SETHE
Its the house People dont

DENVER
Its not Its not the house Its us

SETHE
Denver

PAUL

Leave off Sethe Its hard for a young
girl living in a haunted place That
cant be easy

SETHE
(growing irritated)
Its easier than some other things Come

Denver allows herself to be held

PAUL
Im a grown man with nothing new left to
see or do and Im telling you it aint
easy Maybe you oughta move

SETHE
No

PAUL
Sethe

SETHE

No No moving No leaving Its all right
the way it is

PAUL
You going to tell me its all right with
this child half out of her mind

SETHE

(holding Denver in her arms)
I got a tree on my back and a haunt in my
house and nothing in between but the
daughter Im holding in my arms No more
running - from nothing I will never run
from another thing on this earth you
hear I took one journey and I paid the
ticket but let me tell you something
Paul D Garner it cost too much Do you
hear me It cost too much Now sit down
and eat with us or leave us be

Sethes sudden outburst startles Paul He watches as Sethe
ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to
quiet her down

Alone Paul is disturbed by Sethes words He fishes out a
pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it searching for
smoking papers he knows he doesnt havewaiting for Sethe
to return

When she does she heads straight for the stove She spits on
her finger and touches it to check its heat She then begins
to make bread from flour soda and salt - keeping her back to
Paul throughout - as the scene continues

PAUL
What tree Sethe

SETHE
Huh

PAUL
What tree on your back I dont see
nothing growing on your back

SETHE
Its there all the same

PAUL
Who told you that

SETHE
White girl Thats what she called it I
never seen it and never will But she
said thats what it looked like A
chokecherry tree Leaves branches That
was 18 years ago Could have cherries by
now for all I know

PAUL
I dont follow

Sethe pauses Something in her decides to tell Paul D
although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control

SETHE
I had milk see I was pregnant with
Denver but I had milk for my baby girl
that I sent ahead with the boys I hadnt
stopped nursing her when I sent her and
the boys ahead of me Anybody could smell
me long before they saw me Nothing I
could do about it All I knew is I had to
get my milk to my little girl Nobody was
going to nurse her like me Nobody was
going to get it to her fast enough or
take it away when she had enough nobody
knew she couldnt pass her air if you
held her up on your shoulder only if she
was lying on your kneeNobody knew that
but me

Paul listens half dreading where he thinks this storys going

PAUL
We was talking about a tree Sethe

Sethe works faster It is the work taking an action - any
action - that allows her tell the story numbly without the
pain of reliving itwithout the images attacking

SETHE
Schoolteachers boys drag me into the
barn and took my milk

yet the images come anyway

INTERCUT FLASHES OF MEMORY attack as SETHE TELLS HER
STORY

JUMP CUT TO
INT BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED

- Sethe being raped beaten held down by SCHOOLTEACHERS
BOYS in a barn with a loft

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
-Held me down in that barn and took it

JUMP CUT TO

Sethe screams and is smacked across the face

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
They were like boulders on me Their
hands over my mouth and on my shoulders
and my legs

JUMP CUT TO
One of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two
others hold down her body and ravage her

SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
I couldnt move Alls I could see was the
loft above their heads

JUMP CUT TO

Her mouth covered her head immobile - she stares up at the
loft

END OF MEMORY IMAGES

PAUL
The loft

INT KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

Sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder
on the biscuit doughThe flashes of IMAGES STOP

SETHE
I told Mrs Garner on them She had that
lump on her neck and couldnt speak but
her eyes rolled out tears I remember
Them boys found out I told on em and
Schoolteacher made one open up my back
and when it closed it made a tree

PAUL
They used cowhide on you

SETHE
And they took my milk

PAUL
They beat you and you was pregnant

SETHE
And they took my milk

Sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips
into the stove As she rises Paul steps gently behind her
He slowly caresses her breasts from behind pressing his
cheek against her back He rubs his cheek against it
feeling the scars beneath the dress Raising his fingers to
the hooks as Sethe cries silently he undoes her dress which
slips down to her hips exposing the sculpture her back has
become
PAUL
Aw Lord girl

Grateful to have her body be someone elses responsibility
for the moment Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every
ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth The tenderness is
almost unbearable

Suddenly PAULS LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING He pauses and looks
downHe realizes it is not his legs that tremble but
rather

THE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING GRINDING SHOVING
the house from side to side

Sethe slides to the floor struggling with her dress

On all fours Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if
trying to keep the house together

Paul falling reaching for an anchor begins to shout

PAUL
GOD DAMN IT HUSH UP Leave this place
alone Get the hell outta here

A table rushes at him but Paul grabs its leg Managing to
stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch he holds
the table by two legs and bashes it about wrecking
everything screaming at the house

PAUL
YOU WANT TO FIGHT COME ON GOD DAMN IT
SHE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU SHE GOT ENOUGH

The quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not
stop whipping the table around until everything it is
absolutely still He leans against the wall panting

Sethe is crouched by the stove A mixed expression of relief
and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient

child has been sent away But a child she loves nonetheless

Denver looks frightened More alone than ever now that her
one companion is gone

All three are breathing together as if to the same beat like
one tired person

LAP DISSOLVE

INT KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY
Denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes At the
stove she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits
from the oven

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - CONTINUOUS
A shirtless Paul D is by the water pump washing himself
INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard its contents laying
in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf She takes out a
jar She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the
broken table She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through
the front door

INT BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sethe prepares a bed for Paul Baby Suggs quilt is on the
bed She hesitates whether or not to leave it there

Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands his
shirt hanging open down the front

Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward

SETHE
Why dont youtake a restIll call
you when were ready

PAUL
Sure you dont want me to help clean up

SETHE
Noyoud just get in my way Denver and
mell do it

They stand in silence looking at each other for a moment
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny
Paul starts smiling Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it

And then just as quickly the urge to laugh subsides - and
the fear they feel takes its place

Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the
floor Sethe watches him Paul crosses to her He moves in to
kiss her They approach each others lips like two burn
victims trying desperately not to hurt the other with their
touch

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - CONTINUOUS
Denver sits on the porch steps alone once again Miserably
eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate

INT BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Sethe and Paul lay in bed after lovemaking They are still
fully clothed The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly
Now there is an awkwardness that is without humor or
excitement - but sits like a chasm between them

As Sethe lays there SHE REMEMBERS
MEMORY
EXT THE CORN FIELDS OF SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED

A brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny
corn field

Sethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome strong - run
through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot

HALLE
Hows this

SETHE
Here out in the open

HALLE
Look around - can you see anybody

Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks She
shakes her head no

HALLE
Then nothing can see us neither

He takes off his shirt Seethe giggles as she gets on the
ground keeping her ankles crossed

Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs She
giggles Halle pauses before laying on top of her

HALLE
You are a beautiful sight

SETHE
Dont talk stupid

HALLE
Youre my wife now I can talk as stupid
as I like about you
(she giggles)
I aint never loved nothing like you
before Sethe
(Sethe is moved)
And after I get mama outthen I get us
out too And youll see baby girl
(smiles)

He sings the word life so that Sethe laughs Then Halle
lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love As
camera pans up to a HILL above the field we hear Sethe ask

SETHE (0S)
You sure nobody can see

We hear Halle grunt uh-huh as we arrive on the hill where a
GREAT TREE sits

EXT GREAT TREE ON THE HILL - DAY

Beneath the tree PAUL D SIXO and Pauls brothers Paul A
and Paul P are pouring water over heads and watching

POV Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe their lovemaking is in
clear view to anyone on the hill

PAUL A
Damn I dont get why she picked him

PAUL D
Halles got that way about him That way
a woman feels hes doing it all for her
not for himself at all

PAUL A
I cant see nothing so special about Halle

PAUL F
What about what hes doing for his mama

PAUL A
Fool thing if you ask me By the time he
buys it freedom wont mean a thing to
somebody that old and worn

SIXO
Freedom mean something anytime it come

The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking
A YOUNG PAUL D in particular watches with tender yearning
INT KITCHEN AT SWEET HOME - EARLY EVENING

MR GARNER the man who owns and runs Sweet Home He offers
cooked corn to the men

MR GARNER
Raccoon mustve got into my corn Damaged
a few so no use throwing them out

The men looks to each other suppressing a laugh

MR GARNER
Sethe get the butter there

Everyone looks at each other as they thank No Garner and
begin to smear butter on their corn and eat

A NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garners cautions him

NEIGHBORING FARMER
You spoil these nigger boys

GARNER
Maybe you got boys on your farm My
niggers are men Not a boy amongem
Bought em thataway raisedem thataway

NEIGHBORING FARMER
Beg to differ Garner Aint no nigger men

GARNER
Not if you scared But if you a man
yourself youll want your niggers to be
men too

NEIGHBORING FARMER
Wouldnt have no nigger men around my
wife

GARNER
Neither would INeither would I

Sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to Halle
Paul A and Paul F hesitate as they think of eating the corn
which the lovers consummated But Sixo digs right in

Paul D eats slowly his eyes never leaving Sethe as she moves
Around the kitchen her eyes never leaving HallePauls
Attraction and love for her are apparent
END OF MEMORY

INT SETHES BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

CU on PAUL on his back turned away from Sethe

What began as Sethes memory has blended into Pauls

Sethe rises off the bed breaking the thick silence between them

SETHE
Ill call you when theres something to
eat

She exits leaving Paul alone on the bed
EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - THE FOLLOWING DAY

We see the house now No creaking or sounds of breaking
furniture Just the sound of Paul D singing

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving
the baby ghost away

Denver is sweeping the floor - irritated by Pauls presence
and voice

They both hear the front door open as Sethe arrives home from
work

They look to each other to see which one will make a move for
Sethe first Paul knows enough to bide his time with Denver
He watches as she places the broom down and exits the
kitchen

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - NIGHT

Paul and Sethe sit on the porch together Sethe is sewing
Paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask

PAUL
Sethe
(she stops and looks)
I was thinking of looking for work around
here What do you think

SETHE
Aint much River mostly And hogs

PAUL
Hogs is fine
Paul moves to where Sethe is sitting

PAUL
I dont need much Sethe Eat sleep
sing a little when it strikes me I dont
ask for more toto live somewhere

Sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds

SETHE
All right Itsits fine with me

PAUL
Your girl Denver Seems shes of a
different mind

SETHE

Dont worry about her Shes a charmed
child Nothing ever touch her too bad
From the beginning Everybody I knew dead
or gone but not her

(pause)
You got to know something though - this
here aint no better life Its just not
that other one What I do here - all I
ever do - is keep Denver from that
otherSo if you stay theres no more
talk about Sweet Home or anything else I
wont let the past in my yard again
Getting me and Denver through this here
life is all that matters You understand

PAUL
Dangerous to love anything that much
Sethe Best thing is to love everything
just a little bitthat way when it
breaks or runs off or gets taken well
maybe youd have a little love left over
for the next one

SETHE
Dont be asking me to choose Paul D
There aint no choice here

PAUL
Thats the whole point Im not asking
you to choose Just want to know if
theres some space for me Want to know
if its more than you can stay its
finemore like I want you here Paul
Beat Sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him

SETHE
Maybe we should leave things the way they
are

Sethe rises to enter the house when Pauls words stop her

PAUL
How are they

SETHE
We get along

PAUL
What about inside

SETHE
I dont go inside

PAUL
Sethe if Im here with you with Denver
you can go anywhere you want Jump if
you want to cause Ill catch you Go as
far inside as you need - Ill hold your
ankles Make sure you get back out Im
not saying this because I need a place to
stay I told you Im a walking man but
I been heading in this direction for
seven years When I got here and sat out
there on the porch waiting for you

heading toward It was you We can make a
life girl A life

SETHE
(scared)

PAUL

Sethes heart is twisted She wants to crybecause she
feels hopeand because she feels fear

SETHE

PAUL

SETHE

PAUL

Sethe manages a smile

INT DENVERS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Denver lies curled up in her bed Alone

Sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly Denver looks up
surprised to see her

DENVER
What is it Whats wrong

SETHE
Nothing Nothings wrong Lay back down

Denver obeys unsure

DENVER
You think baby ghosts really gone

SETHE
Dont know

DENVER
I miss her

Sethe lets out a small laugh

DENVER

I do Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would
never hurt me She was my sister When I
was little after the boys left I used
to think that she and me both were
waiting for daddy to come And once he
did she wouldnt be mad no more

(Sethe listens sadly)

They hear Paul singing out on the porch Denver grimaces

DENVER
Wish hed shut-upHes ruined
everything
SETHE
No he hasnt He wont
(hesitates)
Hehe wants to takes us to the
carnival next Thursday

Denvers eyes light up with excitement then caution

DENVER
You mean go out where theyll be other
people

SETHE

Dress up a little bit Wear our hats
What do you think

DENVER
(downplaying her excitement)
Maybe

SETHE
MaybeAll rightall right

Can I ask you something
(Denver nods her back to

Sethe)
I was wondrinWhat you think about
usmaybe maybe thinking we could

startif we got an idea to thinking we
could start countin on
(she stops)

DENVER
On what mama Countin on what

Sethe can barely bring herself to say To hope To imagine
Paul But for Denver she forces herself and whispers
SETHE
Something

EXT CARNIVAL - DAY

Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black
townspeople gathered for the carnival

A sign reads COLORED THURSDAYTWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE
Paul is in high spirits Saying hello to anyone whose eye he
catches Willing eager to get anything for Denver she wants

Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life

Denver is excited but worried She doesnt want to like Paul
but cant help the thrill shes feeling And when one or two
passersby shout out

VARIOUS PASSERS-
BY
Hey DenverHi there Denver

Denver heart almost weeps with joy

Sethe walks cautiously Overdressed for the occasion it is
her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years

She catches the eyes of some of the women she knowsELLA
and LADY JONESgood Christian women who nod in their
acknowledgement yet are holding back something A judgement
A repulsion

Paul doesnt notice them and for this Sethe is glad

MONTAGE of SCENESthe various carnival acts all performed
by a WHITE TROUPE magic clowning fire swallowing spitting
ribbons acrobats forming pyramids

Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty
At one point A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children

CARNIVAL BARKER
All Pickaninnies free

The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit But Paul whispers

PAUL
Two pennies and an insult well spent in
my opinion to see the spectacle of
whitefolks making a spectacle of
themselves

Sethe cant help but let out a small laugh - and with that
laugh a sudden sensation of relief

Paul buys Denver some licorice peppermint and lemonade
Holding the lemonade for her Paul asks

PAUL
Mind if I take a sip

Denver agrees Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim
where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back

to her Denver in spite of herself is starting to like him

END MONTAGE
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Our trio are leaving the carnival walking three astride with
distance in between each The sunlight casts strong shadows

Sethes eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees

THEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS as they walk home
FADE OUT

FADE- IN

EXT A STREAM AND THE BANK BESIDE IT - DAY

WIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL WIDE STREAM (more like a small
river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before
it There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves
gracefully beneath the sun

SUDDENLY

A FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF
THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS
SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS A LACE

COLLAR AND NEW SHOES SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK

Exhausted sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from
asthma she sits leaning against the mulberry tree She
seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck Yet her
skin is like new lineless and smooth Glowing

Although racked with pain SHE IS SMILING Smiling the way
travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long
and arduous journey

EXT WOODS - DAY

The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods She
passes by Denvers BOXWOOD BUSH secret place Then continues
forward as if with a specific direction in mind

EXT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

Sethe Paul and Denver approach 124 Denver is the first to
see

DENVER
Look What is that

All three look to see
THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the
steps of 124

As the three approach the Young Woman lifts her head and
stares directly at Sethe

The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe
curious yet warmThe Young Woman happy yet there is a
hunger in her stare

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup
of water The Young Woman drinks greedily cup after cup

SETHE
You from around here

The Young Woman shakes her head NO She reaches down and
takes off her shoes which Sethe notices as new Sethe bends
down to pick them up The Young Woman never lets her eyes
leave Sethe

PAUL
Those shoes look brand new

SETHE
What might your name be

The Young Woman speaks in a low rough voice

BELOVED
Beloved

Sethe drops the shoes Denver sits down Paul smiles

PAUL
Beloved You use a last name Beloved

BELOVED
Last Nojust Beloved
(she spells it)
BEL0VED

As she spells it we see sethes reaction she is deeply
touched Then Denvers - who looks both amazed and curiously
excited

Sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches Beloved

SETHE
Thats a pretty name Beloved Take off
your hat and Ill make us something We
just got back from the carnival over near
Cincinnati-

But Beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair

PAUL
MissMiss you want to lay down

Her eyes open to slits Paul is about to help her when Denver
rises

DENVER
Ill take her up She can sleep in baby
Suggs room - that all right Mama

SETHE
Course

Denver eases Beloved onto her feet which Sethe and Paul
notice do not have a line or sore on them

PAUL
(whispers to Sethe)
Look at her feet Theyre not walking
feet More like she rode from somewhere
all the way here

Yet Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her
to the white staircase Beloved starts coughing

PAUL
Sounds like the croup

SETHE
Is she feverish Denver

DENVER
No Shes cold

SETHE
Then she is Fever goes from hot to cold

and wraps it around her own body Denver sits up against the
pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denvers arms and
falls back asleep Denver holds her lovingly

INT BABY SUGGS ROOM - DAYS LATER

Denver has not left her bedside She places another quilt
upon her tucking it in around the sides As she does this
Beloveds eyes open for a brief moment catching the sight of
Denver over her She smiles Denver gratefully smiles back

DENVER
Can I get you anything Are you hungry
Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food -
Denvers meal Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and

feeds her Denver is thrilled

As Denver continues Beloved steps towards her and begins to
touch her face - examining her lips her nose her skin as if
it were a rose to admire Denver drinks in the attention her
heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange
creature

DENVER
andand BulgarAt night we used
tocrawl into bed togetherId lay down
on Buls lap and Howard would tell us die-
witch stories He said they would protect
usAnd if I learned them they would
protect me if ever they were gone

EXT PORCH - EARLY EVENING

Everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner

Beloved looking strong and fit eats a cane stick - gnawing
at it to the flax keeping the strings in her mouth long
after the syrup had been sucked off It makes Denver laugh
as she licks her cane stick It makes Sethe smile to see
them both happy

It makes Paul disgusted

INT KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

Paul confronts Sethe as she sews

PAUL
You gonna just feed her from now on

SETHE
Denver likes her Shes no real trouble

PAUL
But dont she have a home Some place to
go

SETHE

Didnt mention one I thought wed wait
until her breathing got better She still
sounds a little lumbar

PAUL
She breathe like she can eat she could
blow this whole house down And all those
sweets
SETHE
Sometimes the body needs that sugar for
strength when its trying to recover
after an illness

PAUL
But thats just it She dont seem sick
Something funny about her

SETHE
Funny How

PAUL
Acts sick sounds sick but she dont look
sick Good skin bright hands and strong
as a bull

SETHE
She can hardly walk without holding onto
something

PAUL
Thats what mean Cant walk but I
passed by Baby Suggs room this morning
and saw her lifting the rocker with one
hand

SETHE
You didnt

PAUL
Dont tell me Ask Denver She was right
there

At that moment Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen

SETHE
Denver Come in here a minute

Denver enters the keeping room

SETHE
Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the
rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one
hand That so

Denver looks at Paul with a hard gaze

DENVER
I didnt see no such thing

From Pauls expression we can tell Denver is lyingand
whatever fragile connection they were building is swiftly
destroyed

INT SETHES BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sethe is getting ready for bed Denver sticks her head in

DENVER
Have you seen her I cant find her

SETHE
Who

DENVER
Beloved

Sethe shakes her head Denver exits anxiously The mentions
of Beloveds name stir a MEMORY in Sethe

MEMORY
EXT GRAVESTONE YARD - A DAY REMEMBERED

Sethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot
sun His YOUNG SON helps him

SETHE
She need a marker Somethin to tell me
where she is But I aint got no money

The Engraver eyes her body

ENGRAVER
What you got then

Sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone especially in
front of the young boy

The Engraver rises takes a step toward Sethe and touches her
hip curling his hand around to her back

ENGRAVER
What you want it to say

SETHE
I was thinking what the preacher say at
the funeral Dearly Beloved

ENGRAVER
(touching her)
For ten minutes I give you one word for
free
His hand glides down to her buttocks Sethe cant help but
see the Young Boy watching the scene

END of MEMORY

INT SETHES BEDROOM - NIGHT

As the memory starts to fade form her mind Sethe suddenly
feels someone elses presence She looks up to find

Beloved standing by the door - watching her

SETHE
OhI didnt know you were there

BELOVED
Can I help

SETHE
Help what honey

Beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning
up Sethes night dress

BELOVED
Where you go in the morning

SETHE
Work I work in a restaurant

BELOVED
What time you go

SETHE
Little after the sun come up I like to
make a loaf of bread before I go How you
feelin

Beloved nods absorbing the information

SETHE
You remember your mother at all

BELOVED
(scratching back of her head)
I remember a woman who was mine and I
remember bein snatched away from her

Sethe nods understanding such things She cautiously
reaches out to stroke Beloveds face Beloved responds like a
puppy pressing her cheek against Sethes hand Sethe is
moved
INT KITCHEN - PRE DAWN

Sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for
work She finds Beloved waiting for her placing out her
cooking things on the table Beloved looks up and smiles

BELOVED
Im helpin make your bread

EXT 124 BLUESTONE - EARLY EVENING

Beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe
coming home from work

When she sees her she runs through the house out the door
to meet her

Denver appears at the door upset by Beloveds loss of
attention in her

EXT PORCH - EVENING

CU - SETHE as she leans her tired head against the porch
sitting on the step She closes her eyes and is about to
drift off when

BELOVEDS HAND gently touches her shoulder settling there

Sethe looks up and smiles patting her hand Beloved stands
above her as Denver takes a seat on the step

Beloved searches Sethes eyes and asks

BELOVED
Where your diamonds

The question surprises Setheand startles Denver

SETHE
Diamonds What would I be doing with diamonds

BELOVED
On your ears

SETHE
Wish I did
(beat)
Hmmcome to think of it I had some
crystal once A present from Mrs Garner -
woman I worked for at Sweet Home
DENVER
I never saw you with no earrings

SETHE
Gone Long gone

BELOVED
Tell meTell me about your diamonds

Sethe hesitates Beloved kneels at her feet

DENVER
(to Beloved)
Maam dont talk about Sweet Home

BELOVED
(ignoring her)
Tell meTell me about your diamonds

Denver awaits her mothers reaction with great interest
Sethe looks at Beloved sweet innocent expression and
something in her resistance eases

SETHE
Wellthis lady I worked for in Kentucky
gave them to me when I got married

Denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mothers
willingness to tell Beloved what shed never tell her

SETHE

What they called married back then I
remember going up to her in the kitchen
to tell her Id help her make ink for
Mr Garner in the kitchen I was fool
enough to think I was going have some
kind of ceremonymaybe even a new
dress

(CONTINUES AS WE CUT TO)

Sethes continues telling Beloved an attentive audience

Denver more attuned to Beloveds interest than the story is
disturbed at her mothers telling of it

INT KITCHEN - ANOTHER EVENING

Camera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke
to

A suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner
Beloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or
whatever she needs She is shining - for Sethe and for
Sethe alone

Denver notices it as well

It is raining outside Both Denver and Beloved are wet from
the rain Denvers hair is all tangled

SETHE
Best unbraid that hair

DENVER
Tomorrow

SETHE
Todays always here Tomorrow never

DENVER
It hurts

SETHE
Comb it everyday it wont

BELOVED
Your woman never fixed up your hair

All three look to Beloved puzzled by her question which is
clearly intended for Sethe Pauls getting more annoyed

PAUL
What

SETHE
My womanYou mean my mother

Beloved nods Paul and Denver exchange a curious look
SETHE
If she did I dont remember I dont

think I saw her but a few times

BELOVED
Tell me bout her

Paul and Denver look to Sethe waiting to see if shell answer

SETHE
I remember once she picked me up and
carried me behind the smokehouse The

only thing I do remember in fact
Paul is disturbed by Sethes carefree storytelling - how it
contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it
will lead to no good

Once again Denver is surprised to hear what shes never
heard before She looks to Paul and knows what he is
thinking Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it But
Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the
eyes

SETHE
She opened up her dress and right on
her rib right here was a circle and a
cross burnt right into the skin

PAUL
(interrupts her)
Sethe
SETHE
What

Paul doesnt want her to continue but doesnt want to say so

PAUL
Any more beans

Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues

SETHE
anyway she points to this mark and
says to me This is your maam I am the
only one whose got this mark now The
rest all dead If something happens to me
and you cant tell me by my face you can
know me by this markScared me so
I couldnt think of anything to say so I
said Yes Matambut how will you know
us Mark me too Mark the mark on me
too

DENVER
Did she

SETHE
No She slapped my face I didnt
understand it then Not until I hada
mark of my own

Paul is disturbed He can see Sethe getting upset He is mad
at Beloved for her damn questions
BELOVED
What happened to her

Something inside of Sethe stops a wall erected Something
unwanted is coming into her consciousness Paul notices it
She rises

SETHE
Dont know Everybody done

Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks

PAUL
Well as long as were all asking
questions getting to know each other
(to Beloved)
Why dont you tell us a little bit about
yourself

Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink placing the
dish inside We hear the others 0OS

DENVER (0S)
(defensively)
She dont remember nothing

PAUL (0S)
You be surprised what you start
remembering once you start talking

BELOVED (0S)
Can I have some more pudding

Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the
kitchen table She is staring out the window above the sink
as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD

POV - OUT THE WINDOW
MEMORY
EXT A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED

A CROWD of people surround a tree SEVERAL WHITE MEN are
preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in
line awaiting their turn

Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an
OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN) Nan is pointing to a WOMAN
(SETHES MOTHER) who is one of the people waiting in line to
be hanged Nan whispers to Sethe
NAN
Thats your mama - right there

Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask
of courage and rage and tears She looks straight ahead - not
at anyone in particular especially not her daughter

NAN
Im telling you small girl SetheMe
and your Mama was taken by the men many
timesShe threw them other babies
awaythe others from the whites without
names she threw them awayBut you she
gave the name of the black man She had
her arms around him child The others
she did not put her arms around
NeverNever

The child Sethe listens watching her mother move further
down the line

END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO

INT KITCHEN -
Sethe the memory passing hears the voices in her kitchen

PAUL (0S)
Aint you got no brothers or sisters

BELOVED (0S)
I dont have nobody

She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second
pudding Denver tries to interfere

DENVER
She has us now

PAUL
You been here five weeks we still dont
know nothing bout you

SETHE
Paul Stop it Denver bring those dishes

PAUL
What was you looking for when you came here

BELOVED
This place I was looking for this place
I could be in

PAUL
Somebody tell you about this place

At the sink both Sethe and Denver pause obviously interested

BELOVED
She told me When I was at the bridge
she told me

Paul looks quizzically at Sethe who shrugs

SETHE
Must be somebody from the old days

PAUL
Howd you come Who brought you

BELOVED
I walked here A long long long long
way Nobody bring me

PAUL
You had new shoes If you walked so long
why dont your shoes show it

SETHE
Paul D stop picking on her

PAUL
I want to know Whered you get them
shoes and that dress you had on

BELOVED
I take the shoes (coughs) I take the
dress (coughs) The shoe strings dont
fit I

Suddenly she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding
and falls backward off the chair

Denver and Sethe rush towards her Beloved thrashes around
until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin

She breathes in Sethes arms as Denver wipes up the mess
glaring at Paul

SETHE
You all right

BELOVED
(whispers)
I want to go to sleep now

DENVER
Come to my room I can watch out for you
up there

Sethe gets Beloved to her feet Denver takes her up the
staircase to her room - glaring at Paul

When the girls have gone Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans
up

SETHE
Whats the matter with you

PAUL
I dont understand what the hold is Its
clear why she holds onto you but I just
cant see why you holding on to her

SETHE
What you care whos holding on to who
Feeding her is no trouble And shes nice
company for Denver

PAUL
We was just starting to feel a little
like a family ourselves

SETHE
Is that whats got your teeth on edge

PAUL
I cant place it Its a feeling in me

SETHE
You wanna feel somethin Feel how it
is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody
there not worrying you to death about
what you got to do each day to deserve
it And if that dont get it feel how it
feels to be a colored woman roaming the
roads with anything God made liable to
jump on you Feel that

PAUL
I know every bit of that Sethe wasnt
born yesterday and I never mistreated a
woman in my life

SETHE
Well that makes one of you in this
world

PAUL
(surprised)
One Not two

SETHE
No Not two

PAUL
What Halle ever do to you Halle stood by
you He never left you

SETHE
Ha whatd he leave then if not me huh

PAUL

SETHE

PAUL
You dont know that

SETHE

ahead of me on their own so I could
stay behind to look for himUnderground
agent said by Sunday we had to leave
Sunday came and he wasnt there

PAUL
He couldnt get out of the loft I expect

Forgetting himself Paul let that slip out

SETHE
Loft What loft

PAUL
(hesitates)
The one over your head The one in the
barn

Sethe stops dead cold Its no use

The MEMORY TAKES OVER
INT BARN - THE PAST

Violent rapid images of Sethe being raped and beaten held
down by SCHOOLTEACHERS BOYS Sethe pinned down stares up
at the loftCamera rises up

There in the loft

hides HALLEThe expression on his face

is that of a man broken in two

END of MEMORY

Sundays and nighttime extra

never touched him But whatever he saw go
on in the barn that day broke him like a

twig

SETHE

He saw them boys do that to me and let
them keep on breathing

PAUL

A man aint a Goddamn ax Sethe

Chopping

hacking busting every Goddamn

minute of the day Things get to him
Things he cant chop down cause they
inside him The last time I saw him I
knew he was broken for good

SETHE

What did he say

Nothing

PAUL

SETHE
What did you say Didnt you say anything
to him

PAUL
I couldnt

SETHE
Couldnt Why the hell not

CU on PAUL who doesnt want to explain - or even remember -
as we cut to

MEMORY
EXT SWEET HOME - DAY
PAUL HAS A BIT IN HIS MOUTH CHAINED TO A WAGON

He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men
by Three white Men The bit jerks his head back saliva
spills uncontrollably out of his mouth His hands are chained
behind him His feet chained together at the
anklesAnother chain is connected to an iron belt and
stretches to a wagon He is being lead away with forty five
other prisoners

PAUL (VO)
I tried to kill Brandywine - man
Schoolteacher sold me to Dont know what
possessed meMe and about 45 other
prisoners were being walked from Kentucky
to Virginiathen on to Georgia Two
places I dont ever want to see again

He is lead past the milk shed when he sees

HALLE alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes sitting
by the butter churn HALLES FACE IS COVERED WITH BUTTER AND
CLABBER He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to
cover his face with the sticky slippery white substance
covering his face and head squeezing it through his hands

The White Men laugh Paul is aching to scream out to him but
the iron bit holds down his tongue

As Paul is lead past Halle A ROOSTER named MISTER is SITTING
ON A TUB in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee

WHITE MAN
Look at Mister there
(referring to the rooster)
You go tell these niggers where to go
there Mister Crowem right outta here
Mister crows and the white men laugh

Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Pauls face He
struggles to keep a view of Halle until he is out of sight

END OF MEMORY
EXT PORCH - EARLY EVENING
Paul approaches Sethe touching her gently

PAUL
I didnt mean to tell you that

SETHE
I didnt plan on hearing it

PAUL
I cant take it back but I can leave it
alone

Sethe instead of collapsing from the information she seems
hardened

PAUL
Lets do thatlets leave it alone now

SETHE

(more to herself)
Let it alone Just sit down and leave it
be Yeah that would be nice Would be
even nicer to lose it altogether - if I
had my choice Halle did Other peoples
brains stopped went crazy How sweet
that would have been Me and Halle
squatting by that churn smashing cold
lumpy butter in our faces not a care in
the world

PAUL
Sethe dont do this

SETHE
What a relief to just stop it all right
there huh Close it shut Squeeze that
butterBut I had three children on
their way to Ohio and nothing would have
changed that And you tell me he didnt
leave me
Sethe exits OS Paul is left alone on the porch until
Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in
pursuit As Denver passes Paul sarcastically remarks

PAUL
Guess shes feeling better huh

Denver gives him a quick disdainful look then continues
after Beloved

The two girls run towards the woods
EXT BOXWOOD BUSH ROOM - NIGHT

Beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon Denver is an
attentive grateful audience

DENVER
Whered you learn to dance

BELOVED
Nowhere Look at me do this

She puts her fists on her hips and skips

BELOVED
Now you Come on Come on

She takes Denvers hand and places another on her shoulder
As they dance Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness
from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloveds
attention

They spin and fall to the ground like two lovers nestled
Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks

DENVER
Why you call yourself Beloved

BELOVED
In the dark my name is Beloved

DENVER
Whats it like where you were before

BELOVED
(a thoughtful expression)
Dark Im small in that place Im like

in curiously and - touching Denvers face - kisses

Smiling Beloved moves to touch Denvers cheek when suddenly
Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved

DENVER

Suddenly Beloveds face turns to rage as she rises up as
well

BELOVED

tell me what to do

DENVER
Butbut Im on your side I want to
protect you

BELOVED
(stands above Denver)
Shes the one Shes the one I need You

Beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the
boxwood bush room as Denvers pleads

DENVER
No Beloved please Dont go I didnt do
nothing We were dancing Don

INT DENVERS and BELOVEDS ROOM - DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY

The room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising
outside

Suddenly Beloved awakens with a start She senses something
She rises and looks out the window to see

POV
SETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD

Beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her as
Denver awakens just in time to see her go

EXT WOODS EARLY MORNING

Sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through
the woods with a specific destination in mind
Soon she comes upon
EXT A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING

Sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing A
LARGE ROCK sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pews
of grass and weeds

Sethe remembers the place as it was She hears the VOICES
OF A CROWDa gathering of people though the clearing
remains empty She crosses to the rock and sits Camera moves
up to reveal -

MEMORY

BABY SUGGS vital and strong standing on the rock
preaching

BABY SUGGS
Im not here to tell you all to clean up
your lives and sin no moreIm not
here to tell you were the blessed meek
and are gloryboundIm here to tell
you that the only grace we can have is
the grace we can imagineAnd if you
cannot see it then you shall not have
it

END OF MEMORY

CU on SETHE as she remembers Baby Suggs words sitting
alone in the clearing - the images of the past gone

EXT WOODS - SAME TIME
Beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place
Camera moves beyond her to find
Denver having followed Beloved watches her from a distance
EXT A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING
Sethe remembers Baby Suggs advice
BABY SUGGS (VO)

EXT FIELD - NIGHT

Sethe tear stained bloody and very pregnant fights her way
through a corn field as she makes her escape

Her dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and
bleeding Her feet already swollen and blistered She is in
agonizing pain She moves like a figure in a nightmare

CUT TO
A SERIES OF IMAGES IN WHICH WE SEE SETHE STRUGGLING THROUGH
DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WALKING AND HIDING IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS
AS SHE MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE STATE
THE FINAL IMAGE IS
EXT ONION FIELD - DAY

Sethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions
have started and the pain is unbearable

Her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body Her legs
are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs
and rock On her back the tree is starting to form

She lays there waiting for death Until a VOICE ASKS

AMY (OS)
WHO THAT BACK THERE

Sethe can not answer as she hears TWO FEET moving through the
field She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she
might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her

A RAGGEDLY LOOKING WHITE GIRL with arms like cane stalks and
enough hair for five heads steps through into view

AMY
Look there A nigger If that dont beat

Sethe can not speak for fear

AMY

for her to put up her feet She talks non-stop as she works

AMY
Never know it to look at me but I used to
be a good size Nice arms everything

She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the
rocks

girl crying beside her Amy is gone She rises painfully
picks up her child and continues on her way

CuT TO
MONTAGE - MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SETHE NOW WITHOUT AMY - A
NEW BABY STRAPPED TO HER BODY - MAKING HER AWAY ALONG THE
OHIO RIVERTHROUGH HOT SUNNY DAYS AND RAINY NIGHTS WITHOUT
PROTECTION SEARCHING FOR FOOD AND SHELTER
FINAL IMAGE IS

EXT RIVER BANK - OAK TREE - NIGHT
A thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river

Sethe is sitting beneath the oak - the rain soaking her as
she breast feeds her baby She cries out loud - but her sobs
and tears are lost in the rain and thunder

EXT RIVERBANK - LATER THAT DAY

Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest She
stops when she sees

A FLATBED gliding down river She cant make out if theyre
white people or not so she hides behind a tree until it
passes

Waiting behind the tree we see that Sethe is sweating a
fever But Denver seems to be doing fine

She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way She
sees

THREE COLORED PEOPLE - AN OLDER MAN and two boys - fishing

She approaches cautiously

One of the boys is the first to see her Sethes bloody and

torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to
m

he young boy He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and
otions for him to turn around

The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where shes
been and why shes there

STAMP PAID
Headin cross

SETHE
Yes sir

STAMP PAID

SETHE
Yes sir My mother-in-law over in

Stamp Paid raises his hand to stop her He looks around to
see that no one else is in sight then motions for her to sit
on a rock As she does he gets a water jug and hands it to
her - she drinks like a madman in the desert The Boys watch
in fascination Stamp Paid turns to one of them and says

STAMP PAID
Take off that coat

BOY
Why

STAMP PAID
You heard me

The Boy slips out of his jacket complaining

BOY
What am I gonna wear

STAMP PAID

He unties the baby from Sethe and wraps it in the coat

EXT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT

Baby Suggs rises off the bench on the porch when she sees
Sethe coming up the walk She runs to her and embraces Sethe
and the baby tears in her eyes

BABY SUGGS
Oh my LordMy sweet Lord thank you

Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house kissing her hard on
the lipsSethe cant believe shes in her arms

BABY SUGGS
Wheres Halle
Sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion

SETHE
He wasnt there

A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism

BABY SUGGS
Well he be along presently Im sure

SETHE
Where are the children

BABY SUGGS
Not now You too ugly looking to wake em
up in the night First we get you well

INT KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

Baby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face her bodyhands

When she gets to her unrecognizable feet she touches them

BABY SUGGS

Baby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethes backShe looks
and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping

BABY SUGGS
Girl

INT KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Baby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethes back -
greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the
inside of a newly stitched dress

INT KEEPING ROOM - STILL LATER THAT DAY

Sethe sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds
dressed waits for her children

Baby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in Sethe
welcomes them to her armsThey run to her jumping on the
bed The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesnt care

The Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her
mama

BABY SUGGS
Already crawling - aint that somethin
Come on baby girlright this
wayMamas waiting

Sethe picks her up and the tears flow She cant stop kissing
them - their necks their heads their handsThe Boys
inspect her strange looking feet and ask

HOWARD
Pappie come

SETHE
Soon

Baby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the
children

BABY SUGGS
All right boys - mamas home now you be
seeing her all the timeGo downstairs
and get your supperGo on

Sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if
she still doesnt believe she can just get out of bed walk
downstairs and be with them The Boys leave as Sethe cradles
the Little Girl

Sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her
breast to the Little Girl She winces with pain and smiles -
she got her milk to her baby girl

Baby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived

BABY SUGGS
Nothing worth saving here

SETHE
Oh waitLook and see if theres
something knotted up in the petticoat
Wedding present From Mrs Garner

Baby Suggs finds TWO CRYSTAL EARRINGS
BABY SUGGS

Be nice if there was a groom to go with
it What do you think happened to him
SETHE

meet him at I had to get out I had to
Hell make it if I made it Halle sure

BABY SUGGS
(skeptical)
Well put these on - maybe theyll light
his way

As Sethe takes the earrings the Little Baby Girl reaches for
them

Through her eyes we see them sparkle and shine - like
diamonds

Baby Suggs hands gently massage Sethes neck as she says

BABY SUGGS
Whatever happens nowGod lead you home
So now layem down SetheSword and

shieldDont study war no more Lay all
that mess down Sword and shield

Sethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm safe hands -
letting go of the diamonds one of which lands in the hands
of the Little Girlwho plays with them in fascination
END OF MEMORY

CUT BACK TO
PRESENT DAY
EXT A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY
Sethe is remembering these last images she eases her own
hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did
She realizes how much she misses herand wonder who can
touch her now and help her lay it all down And then quite
suddenly
AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HER MIND

- PAUL GENTLY EASING HIS HANDS AROUND SETHE FROM
BEHIND TENDERLY KISSING SETHES BACK

PaulThere is Paul Sethe realizes as IMAGES FLASH ACROSS
HER MINDS EYE
PAUL SITTING ON THE PORCH THE FIRST DAY HE ARRIVED

PAUL BATTLING THE BABY GHOST

PAUL SINGING AS HE FIXES THE KITCHEN TABLE

SETHE WRAPPED IN PAULS BIG ARMS AS THEY LAY IN BED

Sethe rises from the ground as if with a new realization
She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods
her pace increasing with each image

EXT WOODS - DAY

Sethe walks through the woods passing Beloved unawares - who
has fallen asleep by a tree Beloved is awakened as Sethe
walks by and gets to her feet to follow

Further on Sethe passes a sleeping Denver who also awakens
upon hearing the footsteps of her mother followed by
Beloved Sethe walks on unaware of them following her

EXT FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE - DAY

Wide angle of Sethe walking well ahead of Beloved and Denver
Sethe is walking with great purpose and energy

INT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY

Sethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen

SETHE

Sethe smiles almost in tears

PAUL

SETHE

Paul D stands up in the tub and holds Sethe against his wet
naked body

attention)
I thought Id make some snap beans

PAUL
Oh yeah

SETHE
Fry up a little corn

PAUL

He kisses her - and thats exactly what she wanted

SETHE

Camera slowly moves out of the kitchen as Sethe and Paul
begin to make love revealing

Beloved watching from the doorway unknown to Sethe or Paul
She is disgusted enviousand runs out

EXT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY

Beloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods
She passes Denver as if she werent there

EXT STREAM IN THE WOODS - DAY

Beloved reaches the stream and steps in She begins to
violently hit the water around her then begins hitting her
own face and head clawing at it as if to escape from the
boundaries of flesh Suddenly she submerges herself
underwater and holds herself there as if to drown herself

She bursts out of the water gasping for airSlowly her
rage subsides replaced with a calm ruthless understanding

EXT THE FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE RD- DAY
Beloved is walking back toward the house She stops
She looks back at the house to the kitchen window - knowing

Paul and Sethe are in there She approaches the kitchen
window and looks in

POV - Sethe is drying off Pauls body and rebuttoning her
dress

Camera moves slowly into a CU of Beloved this time her
focus is on Paul

INT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EVENING
The inhabitants eat dinner in silence

Denver awaits a look from Beloved As Beloved passes her a
bowl of peas with a smile Denver is satisfied

Beloved then turns to Paul offering him the bowl

BELOVED
You have brothers or sisters

Caught off guard Paul looks to Sethe - whose expression asks
him to be nice

PAUL
We dont talk about that

Beat

BELOVED
Sethe told us you been walking for
eighteen years Where you been all that
time

Paul is about to get mad when he looks to Sethe again reels
it back in and answers curtly but politely

PAUL
Lots of places I dont remember them
all Dont remember much about anything

BELOVED
You be surprised what you start
remembering once you start talking

Hearing his own words echoed back to him annoys him

PAUL
Well not me Whats gone is gone No good
come from bringing it back

Pause Paul focuses on his dinner suddenly ill at ease He
cant help looking covertly at Beloved and finds Beloved
staring right back at himIt makes him shiver

The Black Men worksledge hammers in hand

As they work miraculously THEY SINGThey sing about the
women they knew the children they had beenthey sing of
bosses and masters and missesof mules and dogs and the
shamelessness of lifeThey sing of sisters long gone They
sing love songs to Death

INT TRENCH - NIGHT

A torrential downpour The men in the wooden cages watch the
vain filling the trench corroding the red dirt wall around
them

Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet Mud
covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof

Some finds rest others minds are long gone

Camera finds PaulHE IS SCREAMING But there is no sound
coming from his mouth Tears flow down his face but when he
touches them he realizes

They are tears of mud He looks up and the wooden planked
roof is breaking under the power of the rainHe looks down
and the water is up to his thighs

Suddenly the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is
knocked downHe gets up searches through the mud for the
chain and notices its slackHe pulls as well
One by one the men in the boxes realize the chains end is
being undone by the rain as camera tracks down towards the
last box to the dirt wall into which the chain has been
lockedIt is giving way within the muddy wall

THE MEN BREAK THROUGH THE ROTTED WOOD ROOFS TO FREEDOM
WIDE ANGLE

AS THE MEN CLIMB OUT OF THE MUDDY COFFINS GRASPING FOR A
HOLD CRAWLING WITH EVERY MUSCLE OF THEIR BODIES - TO GET OUT
OF THE TRENCH before mud and water drown them

Paul climbs with the will of ten men with every ounce of
strength he has left

END of MEMORY

CUT BACK TO
INT COLD ROOM - A WINTER NIGHT
Paul D is wide awake The memories wont let him sleep

Winter has arrived and the night is cold He lies underneath
a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place even further
from the house He adds newspapers under and around his body
to stay warm

He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether He
hears the door to the cold room open But he does not turn to
look

PAUL
What do you want in here

Beloved enters the cold room

BELOVED
I want you to touch me on the inside part
and call me my name

She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away Paul stares
at a silver lard can so as not to look

PAUL
When good people take you in and treat
you good you ought to try to be good
back You dontSethe loves you Much
as her own daughter You know that
BELOVED
(drops her skirt)
She dont love me like I love her I
dont love nobody but her

PAUL
Then what you come in here for

BELOVED
I want you to touch me on the inside
part

PAUL
Ever since you come here - feel like I

got a new devil to face

BELOVED
You have to touch me On the inside part
And you have to call me my name

PAUL
Aint no chains on me no more I dont
have to do nothingNow go back in that
house and go to bed

Paul continues to stare at the lard can - like Lots wife
hes fearful what turning to look will do

BELOVED
Call me my name

Beloved moves closer right up behind him entwining her arms
around his body like chains

PAUL
No Aint no chains on me

BELOVED
Call me

PAUL
Aint no chains on me

BELOVED
Ill go if you say it

Tears well up in his eyes Paul can feel her warmth He
surrenders

PAUL
Beloved
Beloved presses her body against his He turns and grabs her
kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred

EXT COLD HOUSE - NIGHT

Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the
sounds of lovemaking And cries

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Sethe Denver Paul and Beloved eat dinnerin silence
INT COLD HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT

Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on
his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished Beloved
gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even
friendliness Just a cold look void of respect or even
attraction

She exits the cold house leaving Paul alone He is on the
verge of tears

INT SETHES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him
mad He wants to touch her to wake her to ask for
forgiveness and help But he can not and buries his head in
his hands

EXT SAWYER RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON

Paul waits outside in the cold cupping his hands and
breathing inside to keep them warm He is rehearsing

PAUL
Look here SetheYou aint gonna like
what I got to say but I got to say
itSee its not thea man
cantwhat I mean is it aint really
mesee it aint weakness the kind of
weakness I can fight that girl is doing
it I know you think I never liked her
nohow still dont but she is doing it
to me anyway Fixing me Sethe shes
fixed me and I cant break it

Sethe appears exiting the back door of the restaurant with a
scrap pan in the crook of her arm To her surprise she finds

Paul waiting for her

SETHE
Man you make me feel like a young girl
you coming by to pick me up after work
Nobody ever did that before Better watch
out I might start looking forward to it

She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap
before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment

SETHE
Got to rinse this out

She enters the restaurant Paul watches the dogs eat -
watching them getting what they wanted Sethe re-appears with
a cloth over her head

SETHE
You get off early or what

PAUL
I took off early

SETHE
Anything the matter

PAUL
In a way of speaking

SETHE
Not cut back

PAUL
No no They got plenty of work with them
pigsMore they can handle I just
(Sethe waits)
You aint gonna like what Im about to
say Sethe

Sethe steps forward to hear what Paul came to tell her There
is no apprehension or anger in her look Instead a calm
resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he
had to tell her without it being anyones fault As if she
already knew he cane to say he was leaving her She smiles

SETHE
Well say it Paul Dwhether I like it
or not

Paul knows what shes expecting And when he sees her
diminished expectation the melancholy without blame in her
eyeshe cant tell her about Beloved He is filled with
respect and admiration for her in that moment Something pops
into his head and out of his mouth that wasnt planned
PAUL
I want you pregnant Sethe Would you do
that for me

Sethe breaks up with laughter Paul joins in

SETHE
You came by here to ask me that You are
one crazy-headed man You right I dont
like itDont you think Im a little
too old to start that all over again

She slips her fingers into his

PAUL
Think about it

Paul lifts them putting the tips of her fingers on his
cheek He smiles broadly

She laughs shaking her head A burden transformed into a
gift so suddenly They begin walking

Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each others fingers
stealing quick pats on the behind joyfully Paul throws his
arm around Sethe and squeezes She lets her head touch his
chest They stop and stay that way for a moment - not
breathing Sethe closes her eyes Paul looks up to the trees
lining the roadside like defending arms against attack
Softly suddenly it begins to snow Sethe opens her eyes

SETHE
Mercy

EXT BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING

On the road towards 124 Paul and Sethe run hand in hand
Snow falling all around them

SETHE
I been on my feet all day Paul D

PAUL
Where I been Sitting down

SETHE
Stop I dont have the legs for this

They slow to a walk

PAUL
Then giveem to me

Before she can stop him Paul hoists Sethe up over his
shoulders

SETHE
You need some babiessomebody to play
with in the snow

PAUL
I sure would like to give it a try Need
a willing partner though

SETHE
Ill sayVery very willing

They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when
they are jolted by the appearance of

Beloved Waiting in her usual place for Sethe Her hands
wrapped in a long shawl waiting to be given to Sethe Her
eyes only on Sethe not even acknowledging Pauls presence

Sethe gets herself down from Paul

SETHE
Crazy girl You out here with nothing on

She takes the shawl from Beloveds hands and wraps it around
her shoulders

SETHE
You got to learn more sense than that

She walks on ahead with Beloved Paul suddenly icy cold and
filled with anger walks behind

EXT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT

Denver waits on the porch Sethe and Beloved walk by her

SETHE
Evening girl

Sethe and Beloved enter the house As Paul approaches he
stops before Denver Their eyes meet Paul stares at her as
if to ask - Whos ally are youDenver unnerved by his
look runs into the house Paul waits on the porch until a
moment later Sethe re-appears

SETHE
Now I know you not sleeping out there
tonight are you Paul D

(Paul doesnt reply)
You come upstairs tonight Where you
belongand stay there

As if healed by her strength Pauls face melts into relief
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Denver is cleaning the dishes Beloved sits like an angry
upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth

BELOVED
She likes him here
(to Denver)
Make him go away

DENVER
Shed be mad if he leaves

Beloved didnt consider that Her fingers move violently in
her mouth as if something were bothering heruntil
finally she pulls out a back toothher lips slightly
bloody

DENVER
OOoodidnt that hurt you

BELOVED

DENVER
(cleans Beloveds mouth)
Oh stop Its just a tooth Probably
wisdom Does it hurt

BELOVED
Yes

DENVER

BELOVED

DENVER
If it hurts why dont you cry

Beloved eases herself into Denvers arms and cries

EXT WINDOW OF 124 - NIGHT

We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up
INT SETHES BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Sethe lies with Paul in the dark her face looking up to the
ceiling Paul is asleep

On her face are reservations She rises crossing to the
window to look out

At the same time Beloved appears silently at the doorway of
the room looking at Sethe - hurt and sad She walks by
without Sethe noticing her

Sethe takes a breath at the window watching the snow fall
Then as she moves back to the bed

Camera moves ahead of her to

A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP A

EXT SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED
Sethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and
Bulgar run ahead of her She turns in the opposite direction
and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of
the kitchen

She passes the open window of the classroom and hears

SCHOOLTEACHER
(OS)
Which one are you doing

BOY (OS)
Sethe

Hearing her name Sethe stops and peeks through the window

Schoolteacher is standing over the student who has been
writing in a notebook Schoolteacher licks his finger and
thumbs a couple of pages before saying

SCHOOLTEACHER
No no Thats not the way I told you to
put her human characteristics on the
left her animal ones on the right And
dont forget to line them up

Although Sethe doesnt entirely understand something about
the words disturb her She looks to her children

man being a schoolteacher

As Sethe fills Mrs Garners basin with fresh water she
looks out the window and sees

SCHOOLTEACHER outside with his students we notice HE WEARS A
VERY DISTINCTIVE HAT as Mrs Garners description continues

MRS GARNER

Sethe awakens sweating from having fallen asleep and
reliving her past nightmare She sits up and realizes where
she is She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep She lays
down pressing her body against his so that there is no space
between - enfolding her arms around him

EXT PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY

Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul Stamp Paid and twenty
other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse

Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb
from the cold - Paul D is in high spirits HE SINGS as he

works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers

CO-WORKER 1
Hey - you like this work so much maybe
you best get in the chute with the
others You aint got much more sense
than they do

The men laugh Paul smiles and brushes it off

PAUL
Aint just a job reason to sing Other
things a mans got to look forward to
that a job just a way to spend your day
til the good times arrive

CO-WORKER 2
Good times Aint no such day

STAMP PAID
Now nowits all a state a mind right
Paul D If you can think it it can
happen

PAUL
More than that When a man can make plans
then a man can make good times happen

CO-WORKER 1
Oh the mans got plans You saving up for
a gold mine boy
(more laughter)

PAUL
Better then gold my friend Me and my
womans planning on starting a family

Stamp Paids face registers sudden concern

PAUL
New life Born free hear Now if that
dont define a good tine I dont know
what does

CO-WORKER 2
Nothing born free ever again

PAUL
What you talkin Nobody owns us no more
Nobody gonna own my children neither

CO-WORKER 2
Children inherit what come beforeem
Just cause you cant see no chains dont
mean they not there Were not free men
Were somewhere between freedom and
chains And as long as the world is
white thats where were stayin

The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they
continue working Stamp Paid looks at Paul confused by what
he should do

EXT PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

The men are on break Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed
by SetheStamp Paid approaches and sits beside him

STAMP PAID

understanding
STAMP PAID
You dont know son do you See I had to

carries with him all the time He hands it to Paul who looks
to see

A DRAWING OF A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN beneath a HEADLINE MURDER
RUNAWAY SLAVE KILLS CHILD

PAUL
Who is it

STAMP PAID
That theres a picture of Sethe

PAUL

STAMP PAID

You want me to read to you

Paul senses something terribly wrongand doesnt know
whether to say yes or no

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - EARLY EVENING
Sethe is sweeping the porch

Paul appears on the road When he sees Sethe on the porch in
the distance he stops

Sethe sees him and smiles - but something about his slow
approach to the house sends off an alarm within her

Paul makes his way to the porch He stops before her
SETHE

Already fed the girls You eat
(he shakes NO)
Want something

Paul doesnt answer Instead he steps up to her as he
removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her

Sethes heart stops beating for a moment - not having seen
this image for many years But shes survived worse than the
telling so she faces him

SETHE
Best you come inside

She rises and enters the house Paul follows
INT KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

Paul sits at the table Sethe begins her story seated before
him

SETHE
I dont have to tell you about Sweet
Home What it was But maybe you dont
know what it was like for me to get away
from there

She looks for a response but expects none

SETHE
I did it I got us all out Without Halle
too Up til then it was the only thing I
ever did on my own Decided And it came
off right like it was supposed to

She rises and begins to move about the room circling Paul
as she tries to find a way to explain it all

SETHE
We was here Each and every one of my
babies and me too I birthed them and I
got em out and it wasnt no accident I
did that I had help of course lots of
that but still it was me doing it me
saying Go on and Now Me having to
look out Me using my own head But it
was more than that It was a kind of
thinking-about-myself I never knew
nothing about before It felt good Good
and right I was big Paul and deep and
wide and when I stretched out my arms all
my children could get in between I was
that wide Look like I loved them more
after I got them here Or maybe I
MEMORY

cause they wasnt mine to love But when
I got here when I jumped off that wagon -
there wasnt nobody in the world I
couldnt love if I wanted to

them by giving too muchand they left
their disapproval there sos you could
smell in the air the whole next day

EXT THE FIELD 124 BLUESTONE RD - THE FOLLOWING DAY

Baby Suggs works the field not far from Stamp Paid

SETHE (VO)
Later on I wondered why no one warned
uswhy no one saw them coming and ran

to 124 to tell us

She chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants
She stops - sensing something is wrong She looks up at a
clear blue skyShe hears the birds and the stream way down
beyond the woods

She looks around and sees Bulgar Howard and the Little Girl
Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house

She sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver ina
bushel basket beside her

The clok clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over
to Stamp Paid helping out with the axe

She returns to her workbut something is deeply wrong
And then she hears it
THE SOUND OF HORSES and A HORSE DRAWN WAGON coming from the

distance (The same sound Sethe heard in her first memory of
the sycamores earlier on)

She rises up and looks

POV

EXT BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY

Far in the distance FOUR HORSEMEN ARE RIDING TOWARD THEM
ONE DRIVES A WAGON and IS WEARING A DISTINCTIVE HAT - IT IS
SCHOOLTEACHER

CUT BACK TO
EXT THE FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE - DAY

Sethe continues working until she notices peripherally that
Baby Suggs is standing stock still staring at something

Sethe rises and looks in the same direction

CUT BACK TO
EXT BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY
The Four Horsemen are closer

CUT BACK TO
EXT THE FIELD OF 125 BLUESTONE - DAY
Sethes face freezes in terror as

Stamp Paid in between chops looks up and sees the two
womenthen turns his face to see the men

BUT IT IS SETHES FACE WE CONCENTRATE ON - AS WE INTERCUT THE
ONCOMING APPROACH OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN and HEAR HER WORDS

SETHE (VO)

Theres a Look whitefolks geta Look
every Negro learns to recognize along
with his maams titThat righteous Look
thats like a flag going up the polethe
righteousness that announces the whip
the fist the burning the lielong
before it happens in the open

Over the above speech we see in Sethes expression a death
of soul - an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of
joy and life And with it an insane rage

Sethe grabs Denver out of the basket then scrambles after
the crawling Little Girl (Beloved) scooping her under her
free arm

SETHE
HowardBulgar

The tone of her voice cause the boys to freeze She runs
towards them grabbing one by the hand and ordering the other
to run in front of them She moves and speaks with efficient
clarity

SETHE
The shedGet in the shedRun
Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid watch helplessly -
EXT 124 BLUESTONE -

The Four Horsemen - Schoolteacher his Nephew a Slave
Catcher and a Sheriff - arrive at the house and dismount
tying their horses to the front gate (which is no longer
there)

The Nephew scampers to the front of the house and peers in
the window - he listens Hearing nothing he motions for them

to go round the side of the house

Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid
standing exactly where we left themExcept

They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange

noises thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard

Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road The
Slave Catcher motions with his rifle for them to stop - and
they do

The men move towards the shed meeting up with the Nephew as
he runs past Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid

POV

Camera moves closer towards the shed the sounds coning from
within more audible now

INT THE SHED -
The Nephew opens the door The Four Men enter

Howard and Bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust unconscious -
a bloody shovel lays near them

Sethe is holding a blood-soaked Little Girl (Beloved) to her
chest with one handand Denver by the heels of the other
She is swinging Denver toward the wall planks misses then
tries again

When out of nowhere Stamp Paid rushes by the horrified white
men and GRABS DENVER OUT OF SETHES HAND before she can swing
her a second time

Stillness

Schoolteacher looks at the carnagea bloody saw lies at
Sethes feet the weapon she used on her own childs throat
The Nephew is paralyzedhorrified

NEPHEW
What she go and do that forWhat she
go and do that for

Baby Suggs walks in Whatever amount of Gods grace she could
imagine and will into being vanishes with one look into that
shed

SHERIFF
You all better go on
(to Schoolteacher)
Nothing here to claim I guess
Look like your business is over Mines
started

Schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in
the shed before exiting followed by the catcher and the
nephew

The Sheriff speaks to Sethe

SHERIFF
Ill have to take you in No trouble now
Youve done enough to last you

Sethe doesnt move

SHERIFF
You come quiet here and I wont have to
tie you up

Meanwhile Baby Suggs notices who breathes and who does not
and moves straight to the boys

Stamp Paid extends his arm to Sethe

STAMP PAID
Sethe You take my arm and gimme yours

Sethe turns to him the first time shes looked into anyones
eyes and sees Denver in his armsA sound escapes from her
throat as though shed made a mistake

SHERIFF
Im going out here and send for a wagon

He exits Baby Suggs rubs the boys hands tries to raise
their eyelids spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as
they slowly regain a dazed consciousnessShe whispers
BABY SUGGS
I beg you pardonI beg your pardon

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD -

Sethe clutching the dead baby to her chest is led out of
the shed by Stamp Paid

Outside a throng of black faces have gathered who stop
murmuring the second they see her Among them are Ella and
Lady Jones They are shocked and pained

Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence

Baby Suggs at the same time is getting the boys up the
porch into the house When Denver cries in Stamp Paids arms
she stopslets the boys sit and runs towards the cart

Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff Baby Suggs
takes the crying Denver from Stamp PaidShe tells the
Sheriff

BABY SUGGS
Excuse mebut the child needs
nursinneeds the mothers milk

SHERIFF
Then shes best come too

Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and
reaches for her without letting the baby go Baby Suggs
resists

BABY SUGGS
One at a timeAnd you gotta clean
yourself up

But Sethe only wants her living child The two women struggle
as Stamp Paid does what he canFinally Sethe wins and takes
Denver with her free hand undoes her dress and nurses her
with a bloody breast

Baby Suggs breaks inside Breaks right in two although from
outwards appearances she looks merely numbed by shock

A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of
shoes and hands them to her

WHITE BOY
Mama says Wednesday She says you got to
have them fixed by Wednesday

Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding

WHITE BOY
You hear Baby She says Wednesday

BABY SUGGS
(taking the shoes)
I beg your pardonLord I beg your
pardonI sure do

CuT TO
PRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY)
INT 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT

Paul D sits at the kitchen table The story told Sethe
looks out the windowand waits

PAUL
Your love is too thick Sethe

SETHE
Love is or it isnt Thin love aint love

my babies where theyd be safe

PAUL

PAUL

farther than the yard How did it work

SETHE
They aint at Sweet Home Schoolteacher

PAUL

SETHE
It aint my job to know whats worse
Its my job to know what is and keep them
away from what I know is terrible I did
that
PAUL
What you did was wrong Sethe

SETHE
I should have gone back there Taken my
babies back there

PAUL
There could have been a way Some other
way

SETHE
What way

PAUL

You got two feet Sethe Not four

That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it
Sethe has no responseThe distance between these two people
in this small room is suddenly vast

Paul rises playing with his hatnot knowing how to leave
But desperately needing to He moves to the exit and stops

PAUL
You can set aside supper for me Might
be late getting back

Unable to look at her he turns to exit When Sethe speaks in
a soft forgiving tone he stops to listen

SETHE
After all I told you Paul D and after
telling me how many feet I have you
think saying goodbye is gonna break me
into pieces

Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through
him

SETHE
Youre a sweet man

Unable to bear it Paul turns and leaves
Sethe stands still fighting tears and whispers

SETHE
So long Paul D

INT KITCHEN - DAY
Sethe is scrubbing the floor with Denver trailing by with
dry rags

Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates

BELOVED
What do these do

Sethe and Beloved look up Sethe smiles

SETHE
My Lordwhered you dig up those

DENVER
There for skating on the ice
We have another pair and half of another
I think

BELOVED
Can we try them

Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious
lightness

SETHE
Go ice skating Ha
(beat)
Why not
DENVER

You sure mama

SETHE
Strikes me that after your man leaves it
might just be the wrong time to be
scrubbing floors might just be the
perfect time to go ice skating

Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of
Sethes attitude Sethe speaks to Denver

SETHE
Go get the shawlsand find me an old
shoe for that half a pair

The girls get excited Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the
pail

EXT A FROZEN CREEK - DAY

A bright cold winter day Beloved wears a pair of old
skates Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate
and one shoeThe two girls giggle and fall as they try to
skate on the ice helping each other up Their skirts
whirlingtheir laughter mingled with screams of delight

Sethe wearing only shoes watches them and laughs

DENVER
Come on maamtry

Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly
falls on her rear The girls scream with laughter Sethe
tries to get up and falls their laughter infecting her as
well The girls try to help her and fall over each other in
the trying

Denver rises and tries an independent glide The tip of her
skate hits a bump and she falls flapping her arms wildly
All three laugh so hard they start coughing Beloved goes to
Denvers aid

Sethe rises up on her hands and knees her laughter shaking
her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air

Beloved helps Denver and falls as well The two girls see
Sethe laughing and play it up even more a few more times

Until Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop
and look

The two glide back to Sethe Her laughter has stopped but
her tears have not They gently comfortingly touch her
shoulder

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
It is a snowy night outside the windows

Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire

in the stove She has made sweet milk that she hands to the

girls before taking her place in between them on the floor
facing the fire Denver on her right rests her head on her
lap Beloved sits on her left

She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire The
illumination highlights her beauty and her profile the chin
mouth forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow
the fire threw on the wall Sethe cant help but stare as
another thought occurs to her

BABY SUGGS (VO)
All I remember is how she loved the
bottom of burned bread Her little
handsI wouldnt know em if they
slapped me

SETHE (VO)
Here Look here See this mark If
you cant tell me by my face look here

Beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she
leans back to rest on a propped-up pillow In the flickering
of the firelight Sethe can see

A SMILE OF A SCAR BENEATH HER CHIN

Sethe knows before shes aware of it consciously And just as
it hits her BELOVED BEGINS TO HUM A MELODY

Sethe recognizes it as her own melody

SETHE
I made that song up I made it up and
sang it to my children

Denver lifts her head from her mothers lap to look at Sethe
knowing what is happening

SETHE
Nobody knows that song but me and my
children

Beloved turns to Sethe

BELOVED
I know it

A click Sethe looks at her daughter returned There is no
gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous For
what is truly miraculous is so because the magic lies in the
fact that you knew it was there for you all along

DISSOLVE TO
MORNING
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Its snowy white outside The girls are still asleep in front
of the stove But Denver awakens upon hearing her mother load
the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast Sethe
hears her wake up and turns as she beats eggs in a bowl

SETHE
Back stiff
DENVER
OOh yeahDont know if its the floor
or the skating

SETHE
Could be that fall you took

DENVER
That was fun

Beloved snores lightly beside her

DENVER
Should I wake her

SETHE
No let her rest

DENVER
She likes to see you off in the morning

SETHE
Ill make sure she does But first Im
going make up a nice big breakfast
against that cold outside

DENVER

SETHE

nine years No great troubleWhatever
goes on out there goes on with or without
me showing up on time dont matter
(looks at the girls)

The world is in this room baby This is
all there is and all there needs to be

Denver smiles - but it is a cautious smile Something about
her mothers statement both elates and disturbs her

EXT BLUESTONE RD - DAY

A conflicted and contrite Stamp Paid walks through the snow
down Bluestone road towards 124

As he does he remembers his last conversation with Baby

sees baby Suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes

They exchange a look of silence and finality She turns and
walks to the back door of the house and knocks A moment
later a White Woman appears takes the carpetbag and keeps
Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime
Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns

be cooking a rooster named Mister But

never no beating under Mr Garner
Schoolteacher changed that Why wouldnt
aman run from that Why wouldnt a man
not work kill starve pull out his own
heart to stop feeling stead of feeling

something was less than a chicken sitting

SPRING
EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - MORNING

The sun shines on a warm April daya day abundant with
growth and renewed hope

But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124 It looks more
worn than beforeneglected abused

A broken windowthe front door off its hingea front
step splintered and dangerous

INT 124 BLUESTONE RD - MORNING

Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house
revealing the same neglect inside

Broken furniture dusty floors mess and disorder
Camera enters
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Dirty pans crusted food on the table window curtains
hanging askew

Sethe sits hunched over asleep in a chair against the wall
She wears a dirty torn dress that hangs on her body - which
seems withered frailer since we last saw herIn her lap
lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing
when she fell asleep from fatigue

A LOUD CRASH wakes her up Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED
YELL Her face registers fear She realizes where she is
what time it isand begins organizing breakfast

She places the dress neatly on the chair then grabs a cloth
and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper
placing them in the sink

he opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for
SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 14 full She
earches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening
abinets doors - places that never stored food She realizes
here is none left

tQAOnNnaAN
INT DENVERS ROOM - MORNING

Denver finished dressing She has been able to maintain a
semblance of order about her person and room

But as she steps out into the second floor hallway we see
the same disarray as downstairs

She passes by Baby Suggs old room and discovers

BELOVED sprawled across the bed half naked Her belly is
huge her body unwashed She looks and behaves like a wild
animal

A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as
she shifted in bed Her feet overhanging the bed are still
touching the bedside table where the lamp sat

She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Suggs
old quilt

DENVER
You shouldnt be in here

Beloved jolts her head up to Denver She doesnt like being
looked at unawares

BELOVED
What do you know about it I sleep where
I want

DENVER

You best leave that quilt alone That was
grandmas quilt

Beloved looks at Denver then at the quilt - then abruptly
tears the hole apart with one strong pull

Triumphant she gets out of bed and exits passing Denver

BELOVED
Breakfast ready Im hungry

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it
on one plate which she sets on the table She stands at the
stove with her back to us picking crusted pieces of food
off the bottom of the pan

Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and
begins to eat shovelling the food into her mouth

Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs
as she pretends to wash the dishes

SETHE
Morning

DENVER
Morning maam

Sethe turns not realizing Denver was there as well Their
eyes meet Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the
pan crumbs She smiles

SETHE
You hungry

Knowing there must be nothing left Denver answers

DENVER
No maam

Sethe looks relieved

DENVER
Ill finish those Why dont you sit
down

Denver crosses to the dishes taking the pan from her mother
Sethe nods and crosses to the table to sit down

But as she sinks into the chair Beloved kicks it away

BELOVED
You dont sit with me

SETHE
Baby dont be like that

BELOVED
You dont sit with me I dont sit with
people who leave me

SETHE
Dont talk like that Your mama loves
you

BELOVED

I had another dream last night
(as she eats)
The dead man laying on top of me and I
had nothing to eat And the ghosts
without skin stuck their fingers in me
and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in
the light

SETHE
Dont say those things You forget about
those dreams

BELOVED
You gave me the bad dreams You left me
behind

SETHE

Mama told you - Id give up my own life
every minute every hour of it to take
back one of your tears babyMy children

BELOVED

the eyethe plate breaking

SETHE

kitchen afraid to leave them alone

As she moves from the kitchen she hears

coughs

BABY SUGGS

A NINE YEAR OLD DENVER shakes her head
BABY SUGGS

BABY SUGGS
Why you never go back to Lady Jones and
learn your letters You liked going there
I remember Seeing the other children
Then all a sudden you stop

DENVER

Baby Suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter hurt
by hurtful words

BABY SUGGS

approaching the stairs when she passes Sethes room Its
door is open She looks in

Sethe stands with her back to the door cleaned up wearing
her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival

Denver smiles hopefully

DENVER

Sethe turns startled to reveal - it is BELOVED in Sethes
best clothesWhen Beloved sees Denver she smiles

tauntingly and strikes a pose

BELOVED
I look just like her

Disgusted Denver exits

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Denver walks down the stairs entering the kitchen

Sethe is on her knees picking up pieces of broken plate As
she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against

pieces too small to clean

DENVER
Mama let me help you

SETHE
NOShe wanted me to do it

Sethe continues her work without even looking at Denver

Denver pauses a moment realizing she is of no use here - but
knowing she needs to help her mother somehow

open revealing empty shelvesSHE EXITS - HEADING FOR THE
FRONT DOOR

time shes ever gone alonenot knowing what she will face

beyond the perimeters of her home

She reaches Bluestone Road and stops She looks in either
direction and sees not a soul She takes a breath

She begins to walk - to get help

A block from the house TWO BLACK MEN turn a corner and walk
towards her

Denver stops frightened not knowing what to do
The TWO BLACK MEN pass her tipping their hats saying

And they walk by Denvers eyes speak the gratitude she never
got her mouth open in time to reply Heartened by the
encounter she picks up speed

INT THE BODWINS HOUSE - DAY

The house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and

glass cases filled with glistening things

Denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as

with Janey

JANEY
You know what Ive been here since I was
fourteen and I remember like yesterday
when Baby Suggs holy came here and sat
right where you are Whiteman name of
Garner brought her He and Mr Bodwin

could use some extra help

DENVER
(hopeful)
Ya think

JANEY
They getting older now and I cant take
care of em like I used to More and more
they keep asking me to sleep over night
Now I dont want to quit these people
but they cant have all my days and
nights too I got my own family needs me
Itll take some convincing but maybe you
could come after supper - take care of
your mama during the day then earn a
little something at night hows that

DENVER

she sits
Fine But what would I do at night

JANEY

DENVER

JANEY

In case the house burn down or bad
weather slops the roads so bad I cant
get here on time or late guests needed
cleaning up after Anything

(laughs)
Dont ask me what whitefolks need at
night

During Janeys lines Denver looks about the house imagining
herself here at nighther eyes happen upon A STATUE OF A
BLACK BOY on his knees his head thrown back farther than a
head could go his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with
money for delivery tips On the pedestal are the words AT YO
SERVICE

DENVER

JANEY
Oh yeah They good Cant say they aint

it warmly

INT ELLAS HOUSE - DAY

Ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting
including Lady Jones Janey Wagon M Lucille Williams

M LUCILLE

WILLIAMS
But Ella- you cant just up and kill your
children

ELLA

No and the children cant just up and
kill the mama Whats fair aint
necessarily right

(the women listen)
Now you all know how I felt about the
whole thing I know the rage Sethe felt
in that shed that day We all do But
what I could not understand and still
dont was her reaction to it Prideful
Too damn complicated for a black woman in
her position before God But whatever she
done I dont like the idea of past
errors taking possession of the present
I dont cotton to sin moving in ona
house unleashed and sassy Every day
life takes enough takes all a woman has
Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof
and nobody needs more Nobody needs a
grown up evil sitting at a table with a
grudge As long as that ghost showed
itself from a ghostly place I respected
it But once it take on flesh and come
into this world well the shoes on the
other foot now I dont mind a little
communication between worlds But this
heres an invasion

The women agree

GRACE
Should we pray

ELLA

Uh-huh First Then we got to get down to
business

INT 124 BLUESTONE RD KITCHEN - DAYS LATER
Denver comes down the stairs entering the kitchen

Sethe worn out looking more beaten and ravaged than before
stands at the sink with an ICE PICK chopping up ice Denver
speaks to her but she does not turn or acknowledge her

DENVER
MamaMama Im going out
(no response)

Mama I got a job Working over at the
Bodwins at night Mr Bodwin coming over
now to pick me up on his way back from
town Ill be staying there nights and
coming back here for the daytime Well

Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized Denver
approaches her from behind and whispers softly

DENVER
Im going help you mama Dont you give
up yet

Denver touches her gently but Sethe acts as if she hears and
feels nothing Denver exits

EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - LATE THAT DAY

Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr Bodwin when
she hears
THIRTY WOMEN gathered together walking up Bluestone Rd
towards 124 SINGING A HOLY SONG

Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position
themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles
crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they
could find

INT 124 BLUESTONE RD THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY

Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloveds forehead with a cool cloth
filled with ice when the two women hear the singing

Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see
EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - DAY
The women continue singing
CuT TO
EXT FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD - DAY

MR BODWIN sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse is riding
toward 124 when he hears the singing as well

WE NOTICE THAT MR BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE
SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day

CUT BACK TO
EXT 124 BLUESTONE RD - DAY
The women continue singing as

Sethe and Beloved her belly as big as a pregnant womans
exit the house

The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by
the lack of fear between the women

Sethe is holding Beloveds hand Beloved is smiling brightly
at the beautiful singing

Denver looks to her mother

Tears run down Sethes face but she is not crying The sound
of the womens voices wash over her like a baptism She looks
to all the women faces she remembers faces she has missed
although up until this moment was not conscious of missing
Then Sethe looks beyond the women and sees

MR BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON SHE SEES MR BODWIN
WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS

Sethes expression turns to fear then rage In her ravaged
mind she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back

SETHE
NoNo hes not coming into my yard He
not taking my best thingNo

She releases Beloveds hand and moves forward

SETHE
Nonono

DENVER
Mama

She passes Denver feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON

SETHE
NoNONO NOOOOOO0000000

As Mr Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from
124 HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS

SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN HER HAND EXTENDED
HOLDING THE ICE PICK

DENVER
MAMA NOOOQOOOO

DENVER RUNS AFTER HER SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR
BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER CREATING A HILL OF BLACK
PEOPLE SETHE RISING TO THE TOP HER HAND EXTENDED DENVER
REACHING HER FROM BEHIND PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER
OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM

Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and
defend with the ice pick And something within her is
resolved For a moment we see a calm spirit instead of a
wild animal And a tear upon her face

Then just as quickly she sprints around the side of the
house and disappears from view

The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother
Mr Bodwin looks on stunned

WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING
THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING

rest and to dance The backs that needs
support The shoulders that need arms

unnoosed and straight So love your neck
And with her twisted

put a hand on it grace it stroke it and
hold it up Love all your inside parts
love emand the beating heart love
that too More than eyes or feet More
than lungs that have yet to draw free
air love your heart For this is the
prize

DANCE AND TWIRL UP ON HER ROCK

And the
CAMERA
Among t

he crowd we see FAMILIAR FACES

WE SEE THE WOMEN WHO SANG AT 124

WE STAM

P PAID ELLA JOHN and LADY JONES

AND WE SEE SETHE SURROUNDED BY ALL HER CHILDREN

THE END

broken old body BABY SUGGS BEGINS TO

crowd gives her music SINGING IN FOUR PART HARMONY
PANS THE CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL FACES singing together

FADE OUT
