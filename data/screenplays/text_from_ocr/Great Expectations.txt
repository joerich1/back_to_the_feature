FADE IN

EXT MARSHES KENT - DUSK

A BOY runs across the dark flat wilderness of the North
Kent marshes A bitterly cold December evening the misty
light is fading and the boy races as if trying to outrun
the darkness

This is PHILLIP PIRRIP - ‘PIP’ He is eight years-old

EXT CHURCH MARSHES - DUSK

A small squat church sinks on the boggy ground A yew
tree - PIP snaps off a twig and adds it to the forlorn
bunch of wintery sticks he carries

A modest tombstone bears the inscription

Here lies PHILLIP PIRRIP late of this Parish Also
GEORGIANA wife of the above Also ALEXANDER BARTHOLOMEW
TOBIAS ABRAHAM ROGER

Five tiny lozenge-shaped graves mark the childrens’ final
resting place

PIP lays his modest tribute and sets about brushing away
the weeds and dead-leaves that clutter the grave -

- as an IMMENSE FIGURE looms behind him and snatches him
up PIP goes to cry out but a filthy hand is clamped
across his mouth as he is hoisted weeping and struggling
into the air

THE CONVICT
Hold your noise Hold your noise you
little devil or I’1l cut your throat

The convict is a formidable figure immense and
terrifying his head and face brutally shaven and scarred
His name is MAGWITCH though we won’t hear this spoken
aloud for some time

MAGWITCH
Tell us your name Quick

PIP
Pip

MAGWITCH
Once more Give it mouth

PIP
Pip Pip sir
Then PIP is flipped upside down held by his ankles

shaken

GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012)

MAGWITCH
Got wittles on you boy Tell me

PIP
No sir

- then upright again he’s seated on a tombstone his
tiny face held in massive manacled hands

MAGWITCH
What fat cheeks you ha’got Darn me if I
couldn’t eat em Where’s your mother

PIP
There sir
(MAGWITCH flinches -)
‘Also Georgiana’ with my father ‘late
of this parish’ My brothers too

MAGWITCH
An orphan eh Who d’you live with
That’s supposin’ I let you live

PIP
My sister sir - Mrs Joe Gargery wife of
Joe Gargery the blacksmith sir

MAGWITCH
Blacksmith eh
(a moment)
You know what a file is

PIP
Yes sir

MAGWITCH
And you know what wittles is

PIP
Yes sir food sir

MAGWITCH
(breath hot on PIP’s face)

Now I ain’t alone as you may think I am
There’s a young man hid with me in
comparison with which I am an angel has
a secret way of getting at a boy and at
his heart and at his liver so that they
may be roasted and ate It is in vain for
a boy to hide from that young man A boy
may lock his door may tuck himself up
may draw the clothes over his head and
that young man will softly creep and
creep his way to him and tear him open

MAGWITCH (CONTD)

(whispers in the ear of the

terrified boy)

You bring me tomorrow morning early at
yonder battery that file and them
wittles - never daring to say a word -
and I will do what I can to keep that

young man out of your insides

Understand
(PIP nods)
Speak it out
PIP
Yes sir
MAGWITCH

Now Get you home

PIP turns tumbles away pausing just long enough to turn
and see the convict disappear into the misty graveyard

EXT MARSHES KENT - DUSK

PIP runs towards home as fast as he can

His stride slows

A gibbet hangs over the road empty but still sinister in

the gathering gloom

PIP steps warily beneath then starts to

run once again

PIP’s home adjoins the forge Made of wood the house is
modest but comfortable enough and a safe refuge now

PIP barrels towards the door and straight into -

INT KITCHEN GARGERY HOUSE - NIGHT

JOE GARGERY the blacksmith - a rich Kentish accent

JOE

There you are Your sister’s been out a
dozen times looking for you old chap

And on cue a ferocious cry comes from outside

MRS JOE (0S)
PIP PIIIIIIP

With practiced efficiency JOE takes a towel wads it up
uses it to pad the back of PIP’s trousers
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 4

JOE
She’s on the rampage Pip and she’s got
Tickler with her Best get behind the
door old chap I’1l do my best

A closer look at JOE - fair curly hair pale eyes he’s a
large powerfully-built man devoid of aggression
incapable of malice Good-natured child-like almost

And then MRS JOE is in the room Ferocious black-hair
red-faced with fury

MRS JOE
Where have you been you little monkey
Wearing me out with fret and worry I
said where have you been

She charges at PIP wielding her cane ‘Tickler’ JOE does
his best to shield PIP behind his large leg but MRS JOE
simply beats him too

PIP
The churchyard As it was Christmas -

MRS JOE
The churchyard If it weren’t for me
youd’ve been to the churchyard years
ago and stayed there Who brought you up

by hand
PIP
You did
MRS JOE
And why did I do it I should like to
know
PIP

I don’t know

MRS JOE
Gargery - fetch the tar water

JOE
No need for tar water
(she turns on JOE)
It is Christmas my love

MRS JOE

(a moment then -)
Bad enough having to be a blacksmith’s
wife without having to mother you too
Ha Churchyard

(sawing at a loaf of bread)
Youll drive me to the churchyard between
you one of these days and a precious
pair you’d be without me But you’d like
that I suppose the both of you

GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 5

And as her monologue continues PIP slides out from his
hiding place and exchanges looks with his ally JOE

A mute conversation ‘you alright old chap’ ‘thank you
Joe’ JOE ruffles his hair an understanding But MRS JOE
is watching

MRS JOE
Table Now

They take their places at the table PIP eyes the bread
The sound of a cannon in the distance distracts JOE and
PIP snatches the bread stows it beneath the table

JOE
Hear that
(another distant explosion)
There’s a conwict escaped off the Hulks

PIP
What might he have done this convict

And MRS JOE is on him again

MRS JOE
Murder most likely That’s why they’re
put in the Hulks because they murder-

PIP
Murder

MRS JOE
- murder and rob and ask too many
questions
(points the knife)
Where’s that bread gone

It’s in his hand beneath the table -

PIP
I ate it

A moment MRS JOE glares but PIP holds his nerve and she
turns JOE regards PIP questioningly PIP shrugs and
squeezes the bread into his pocket

INT PIP’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 6
Hungry terrified PIP hides beneath the covers thinking
on murder Every object in the small meek attic room

seems menacing every creak seems to speak ‘murder’ PIP
pulls the covers higher squeezes his eyes shut

INT LANDING GARGERY HOUSE - DAWN 7

Every floorboard creaks as PIP tip-toes past JOE and MRS
JOE’s bedroom A glimpse through the door - his sister
snoring

INT LARDER GARGERY HOUSE - DAWN 8

PIP lifts the lid from a stoneware pot and removes a
magnificent meat-pie

Brandy is poured from bottle to flask the flask corked
the bottle now half-full PIP thinks a moment tops the
bottle up with a filthy viscous liquid - tar water He
shakes the bottle in the hope of hiding the deception

PIP turns and jumps a dead hare hangs from the ceiling
its glassy eyes glaring accusingly at the young thief

EXT BATTERY MARSHES - DAY 10

Christmas Day is damp and misty as PIP hurries guiltily
towards the old fort that is their rendezvous A seated
figure is visible through the mist -

THE CONVICT is slumped cold and miserable on a stone
inspecting the wounds caused by his manacles PIP
approaches gathers his nerves and touches the man on his
shoulder

The figure turns -

But it’s a different CONVICT gaunt sinister with cruel
brooding eyes and a livid bruise on his face

He swipes at PIP with his chained hands and PIP turns and
flees the hunched figure hobbling after him growling
EXT BATTERY MARSHES - DAY 11
Breathless PIP stumbles on relieved to see that the
cannibalistic young man has gone for the moment at least

But suddenly -

MAGWITCH
Well did you bring it boy

MAGWITCH scoops PIP up into the air
PIP

(handing over the bag)
Yes sir Here sir
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 7

MAGWITCH
And what’s in the bottle

PIP
Brandy

Back on the ground PIP watches MAGWITCH drain the bottle
of brandy then set about the pie scooping great handfuls
into his mouth glaring about him like a starving dog
protecting his food

MAGWITCH
You brought no-one with you

PIP
No sir

MAGWITCH
And asked no-one to follow

PIP
I would not do that sir

MAGWITCH’s eyes burn into PIP Finally -

MAGWITCH
I believe you A cold-hearted hound you’d
be at your time of life to hunt down a
wretch as near to death and dunghill as
me

PIP despite himself is encouraged by the approval

PIP
I’m glad you enjoy the pie

MAGWITCH
Thankee my boy I do

PIP
There’1l be none left for him

MAGWITCH
For ‘him’ Who’s ‘him’

PIP
The young man you spoke of Who wants to
eat my liver

MAGWITCH
Oh him
(Laughs-)
He won’t want no pie

PIP
He looked as if he did
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 8

MAGWITCH
Looked What d’you mean looked

PIP
I saw him

MAGWITCH
When

PIP
Just now

MAGWITCH
Where

PIP

Down by the river

MAGWITCH
Dressed like me Bruised face Here
Badly bruised
(PIP nods)
Give me the file boy

Immediately MAGWITCH is sawing wildly at his chains
oblivious to the raw red wounds about his ankles
muttering to himself

MAGWITCH (CONTD) PIP
Hunt him down like a Goodbye then sir A merry
bloodhound I will Let him Christmas to you
go free Let him make a Goodbye

tool of me again and again
That villain No I’1l take
him to the bottom of the
river if I have to drag him
there myself

And getting no response PIP shrinks away into the mist

A Christmas carol sung with great volume and little tune -

INT PARLOUR GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 12

A squeeze-box wheezes away The carol is performed by MR
PUMBLECHOOK and the GARGERY’s other Christmas guests MR
and MRS WOPSLE and MR and MRS HUBBLE These clerks and
tradesmen are what pass as gentle-folk in the narrow
confines of the village and MRS JOE is appropriately
puffed-up

PIP does his best to slip in un-noticed but MRS JOE sees
him and discreetly draws her finger across her neck

INT PARLOUR GARGERY HOUSE - DAY 12A

Later The Christmas dinner is laid PUMBLECHOOK dominates
the festivities a large man with dull eyes and a mouth
like a fish

PUMBLECHOOK
For the great feast that we are about to
receive - thanks to you ma’am - may the
good lord make us truly thankful

ALL
Amen

MRS JOE
Did you hear that Be grateful

PUMBLECHOOK

brought you up by hand

MRS HUBBLE
Why is it that the young are never
grateful

A moment’s contemplation of this devastating gambit

PUMBLECHOOK
Naturally wicious

Mumbles of ‘true true’ PIP is in hell but JOE is there
JUMP CUT - Meal underway PIP picking at fat and gristle

JOE

MRS JOE
Oh I nearly forgot Ladies and

MRS JOE

A ferocious fight is taking place with MAGWITCH looming
huge and victorious over his slighter opponent

The second CONVICT’s face is a mess of mud and blood with
a vicious gash down one side of his face the fight so
brutal that the SOLDIERS can only stand and watch too
frightened to intervene spectators in a flame-lit arena
The SERGEANT pushes through -
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 12

The SOLDIERS pull them apart the two CONVICTS swearing
and clawing at each other throughout

MAGWITCH
I took him Take note I took him and
gave him up to you

a dead man if you hadn’t got here

eyes Look me in the eyes villain LOOK

MAGWITCH makes another murderous lunge at his enemy but
is pulled back and down by four of the SOLDIERS

And it’s only then forced to the floor like a wild
animal that MAGWITCH meets PIP’s eye sees the fear and
alarm on the young boy’s face For a moment MAGWITCH
snarls moves towards the boy -

But PIP puts his hand to his own chest and shakes his
head ‘It wasn’t me’ -

A moment then all the fight goes out of MAGWITCH
Something almost like shame comes to his face And he
allows himself to be hauled to his feet and manacled once
more

MAGWITCH is about to be led away too but he turns a
moment and without looking at PIP speaks to the

No ma’am I am very sorry for you and
sorry that I can’t play If you complain

ESTELLA is already approaching lit by candlelight She
walks past him and straight to MISS HAVISHAM With a
strange mechanical movement a ritual almost ESTELLA
places her head on her lap

MISS HAVISHAM picks a broach from the dressing table and
places it against ESTELLA’s dress in her hair watching
how the jewels compliment her skin

MISS HAVISHAM

ESTELLA as if arming her)

He’s to wait in the ballroom

36 INT BALLROOM SATIS HOUSE - DAY

The door is closed on PIP A fire has been lit in the

great grand ballroom but the smoke hangs in the air like

marsh mist Rising out of it is the great long banquet
table covered with dust and mould In the centre of the
room stands the clock hands stopped at twenty to nine

Both repelled and fascinated by the sight PIP moves
towards the table’s centre-piece a cake now overhung
with cobwebs and black with fungus

PIP peers closely then recoils in disgust as a fat black

beetle crawls from beneath the rotten icing A voice -

MISS HAVISHAM
What do you think it is

GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PAGES 1012) 27

PIP
A cake

MISS HAVISHAM

He does so starting a slow steady circuit of the table

MISS HAVISHAM
Today is my birthday -

PIP
Many happy ret-—

MISS HAVISHAM

I will not have it spoken of On this day
of the year long before you were born
this heap of decay-

(- the cake - )
- was brought here and we have worn away
together Mice have gnawed at it and
sharper teeth than mice have gnawed at
me When the ruin is complete when they
lay me dead in my bride’s dress on the
bride’s table the curse will be finished
on him

PIP
On who Miss Havisham

But ESTELLA the HAVISHAMS and POCKETS are waiting in the

(to PIP)
Ah the vultures Estella - feed the boy
EXT GARDENS SATIS HOUSE - DAY 37

Eating his lunch a hunk of bread PIP starts to explore
the strange overgrown gardens

- In a courtyard a once fine coach stands derelict a
remnant of another era

- The stables empty and sinister
- A once elegant greenhouse twisted and shattered

- Rows and rows of barrels the source of the Havisham
fortune now broken and drained There’s someone there

warmth of the sun eyes closed A private reverie PIP
hides watches -

quietly to herself Youthful natural exuberant not at
all the stern and harsh girl we have seen before now PIP
watches sinking deeper into love when -

puny

PIP
Take that back

YOUNG GENTLEMAN

PIP
You will take that back

YOUNG GENTLEMAN
Fight me then
(and he starts to take off
his jacket)
Regular rules Come to the ground

And he starts to prance like some absurd prize-fighter In
her hiding place ESTELLA stifles her laughter

PIP too isn’t quite sure what to do until a feeble jab
lands on his arm and he responds with a neat punch to the
pale YOUNG GENTLEMAN’s nose It’s as much fluke as skill
but he’s surprised to see the boy sprawling on the floor

The boy takes the blow in very good spirits dabbing at
his nosebleed springing to his feet

YOUNG GENTLEMAN
That means you won Honour is satisfied
Much obliged Good afternoon

As she turns the key ESTELLA pauses

PIP kisses it A moment of pure bliss and utter confusion -

loved this man devotedly passionately
idolised him and soon they were engaged
He persuaded her to buy her half-
brother’s share in the brewery at an
immense price so that when he was her
husband he could hold and manage it all

In the fine master bedroom MISS ELEANOR HAVISHAM sits in
front of a mirror It’s hard to see her face beneath the
veil but she’s a little older than one might expect for a
bride in the last years of the 18th Century Nevertheless
there’s no mistaking the grace and beauty there -

ARTHUR HAVISHAM beckons to him takes the letter from the
MESSENGER and regards it carefully

A moment of hesitation of conscience Then a decision -—

ARTHUR HAVISHAM
Sister -
(ELEANOR HAVISHAM turns)
It’s for you

Smiling trustingly she takes the letter ARTHUR’s eyes
fix on her face as she breaks the crimson seal

The room falls silent She scans the letter Scans it
again trying to make sense of the words The letter falls
from her hands -

A hand clad in white wedding-lace reaches into a great
clock and stops the pendulum The time is turned back to

On the table the glorious wedding-cake -

A small figure in white retreats into the darkness of the

A grand society ball is in full swing The room is packed

with young London’s brightest and finest But none is more
striking more beautiful and startling than ESTELLA

She stands amidst a pack of love-lorn suitors handsome
high-society men The FINCHES storm in and sensing
trouble the crowd parts

ESTELLA catches swaggering DRUMMLE’s eye and offers up a
radiant smile Then she sees PIP

Their eyes lock and for a fleeting moment there’s a look
of startling sadness and regret in ESTELLA’s eyes -

Then it is gone and once again she is beautiful cold
invulnerable She takes DRUMMLE’s hand

DRUMMLE
A waltz

The music begins and ESTELLA and DRUMMLE start to dance

All this is observed by JAGGERS dispassionately observing
the resolution of a plan

PIP can take no more Devastated he flees ESTELLA spots
this stops dancing abruptly and goes to follow -

- but DRUMMLE’s meaty hand grasps her bare arm

DRUMMLE
The dance is not yet over

The other DANCERS see this confrontation

Remove your hand sir

Their eyes lock - a challenge ESTELLA is unflinching
DRUMMLE concedes ESTELLA departs leaving her would-be
lover standing alone humiliated

No but you can

ESTELLA
Perhaps If I cared

PIP
But you must care To encourage a man as
despised as addle-headed and unworthy
and boorish as Bentley Drummle a man who
has nothing to recommend him except
money

ESTELLA
Pip don’t let it affect you so

PIP
I can’t help it To give that man the
looks and smiles you never give to me

Nervously PIP places his other hand on ESTELLA’s waist
A breathless intimate moment their faces close as they
dance

Then a voice -

embracing him)
Yes dear boy I’ve made a gentleman of
you I swore that time as sure as I ever
earned a guinea that guinea should go to
you I lived rough so that you should
live smooth I worked hard that you
should be above work And when the blood
horses of them colonists kicked up dirt
in my face and they called me a convict
a common fellow I said to myself ‘I’m
making a better gentleman than you will
ever be’

is something of the knight-of-old about PIP this time

Estella you know I love you have loved
you ever since I first saw you in this

Havisham had meant us for each other
Clearly the idea was absurd and I hope
Miss Havisham will take what pleasure she
can from knowing that I am as unhappy as
she ever meant me to be

MISS HAVISHAM flinches puts her hand to her chest

Oh Pip are you very unhappy Do you hate
me very much I know that you must hate
me but if you can ever bear to forgive

She follows him But the long train of MISS HAVISHAM’s
wedding dress is uncoiling behind her knocking a table

A candle falls igniting the desiccated material It
burns the flames catching with startling speed burning
through the dress like a fuse

And now MISS HAVISHAM becomes aware of the flames behind
her writhing as they catch the dried silk and organza and
lace the flames burning around her as she screams and
grabs the table-cloth The rotting wedding-cake the glass
and crockery the rats and beetles and spiders fall to
the floor

Helplessly PIP swats at the flames burning his hands
then grabs the curtains tears them down the dawn light
pouring in rats and spiders fleeing the light He wraps
the fabric round MISS HAVISHAM holding her tight until
the flames are extinguished

The wedding-cake lies shattered on the floor

And now JAGGERS bursts into the smoke-filled room Ashes
float in the air like confetti and PIP sits and cradles
