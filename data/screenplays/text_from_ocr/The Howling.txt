DR WAGGNER’S TV SPEECH

We’ve all heard people talk about “animal magnetism” about the “natural
man” and the “noble savage” As if we had lost something valuable in our
long evolution into civilized human beings -- and there’s a good reason for
this Man is a combination of the learned and the instinctual of the
sophisticated and the primitive We should never try to deny the beast the

animal within us -- only to channel these energies in a positive
direction
All of us have a great untapped potential -- a potential for living What

we do with that potential with that life depends as much on our attitudes
toward our physical desires as it does on the social programming of our
minds The struggle between mind and body is not a necessary one It
produces anger frustration the strain of modern-day living in a world
that’s moving too quickly toward its own annihilation Stress results when
we fight against our impulses when we attempt to destroy the natural man
or woman within us Repression is the father of neurosis of self-hatred

Let me say a few words about my new book THE GIFT When we’re born each
of us is given a gift -- the gift of life

their heart nothing They may look dead but two three days and they’re
good as new-
