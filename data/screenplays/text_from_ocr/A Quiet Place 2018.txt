FIRST ACT

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

The hilltop is lined with corn Golden and brown Shimmering
in the morning heat

There’s a structure in the distance

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

A FARMHOUSE built from old lumber There’s no cattle or
livestock in sight Unusual for this fertile land

INT FARMHOUSE DEN - DAY

APRIL gazes out the window pane Nervous eager sweet
She has a HEARING AID in one ear

She’s focused on a TOOL SHED one hundred feet away isolated
under a crooked apple tree

Her eyes drift from the shed to her older brother WILL who stands outside He sticks his tongue out She ignores
him This is their dynamic

EXT SHED - DAY

April picks weeds outside the shed She pockets a PURPLE IRIS
and wipes dirt on her sweater

Will plays nearby with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER It wears a MUZZLE

EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY

April empties the weeds into a tin TRASH CAN She places the
lid back on the trash slowly ensuring that it doesn’t make
even the slightest sound

EXT PORCH - DAY

Will approaches the front door The retriever follows closely
behind He motions for the dog to “stay”

Then slips a pair of disposable SHOE COVERS over his feet
before entering
INT FARMHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

Will’s mother MIA (30s) holds a RED CRAYON to her lips She
has lovely green eyes and auburn hair She balances a LAUNDRY
BASKET next to her PREGNANT BELLY

She stands before a CALENDAR on the wall charting each day
of her pregnancy She crosses off another day and hands the
crayon back to --

Will who colors in a NEW DRAWING His hands dig loudly
through a tin of crayons

Mia waves her finger Will freezes reprimanded for the
hundredth time

He reaches under his parent’s bed for a pair of oversized
WINTER GLOVES He places the gloves over each hand then
quietly resumes his search

INT FARMHOUSE HALL - DAY

Mia walks past April and collects her dirt-stained sweater
into the laundry basket

INT FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

We follow Mia to the WASHER AND DRYER The machines have been
unplugged

She empties the basket into the washer Adds water and soap
Lightly stirs the clothes with her hands

Mia stops momentarily The purple iris floats in the water

An idea strikes her - she leans over to a MARKER BOARD
labeled BABY NAMES and adds IRIS to the list

A hand cuts the frame immediately crossing out ERIS

JOHN (40s) the patriarch of the family shakes his head An
MP3 PLAYER plays MUSIC in his headphones that we can’t hear

John points to another name on the list HOLLY Mia playfully
purses her lips He places a comforting hand over her bump

John puts one of his EARBUDS into her ear Our world is
filled with MUSIC - maybe a song from when they first met
INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

John and Mia slow-dance through the living room very much in
love after all these years

They both wear SHOE COVERS on their feet And as they move
together about the house a theme materializes in the
background Every inch of wall and floor has been
painstakingly covered with THICK PADDING Sometimes FOAM
sometimes WOOL INSULATION Too ugly to be an aesthetic

choice Must be product of necessity

INT FARMHOUSE DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Mia sets the table All of their plates and cutlery are
plastic She gestures to John to gather the children for
dinner

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON

John tops the stairs He opens a DOOR labeled “Will” in
stenciled letters

Will sits at his desk finishing his drawing John MIMES an
eating motion Will acknowledges

John moves on to the SECOND DOOR labeled “April” in a flower-
patterned alphabet Peeks his head inside

It’s empty
John moves further down the hall to a THIRD DOOR No letters
on this one - only a sun-faded patch suggesting a name was

once removed

He hesitates before opening the door --

INT FARMHOUSE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

April sits on a stripped MATTRESS FRAME in a sparsely
decorated room Looks like someone used to live here long
ago She closes the DIARY she’s writing in annoyed by the
intrusion

John MIMES the eating motion and extends his hand
encouraging her to join

April rises from the bed and approaches her arm outstretched
as if she’ll grab John’s hand BUT --

APRIL CLOSES THE DOOR IN HIS FACE
INT FARMHOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING

The rim of the sun sets outside casting an orange glow over
the dinner table

The family finishes their supper Mia clears the table

John unfolds a MONOPOLY game board as April finally joins
from upstairs She takes the furthest seat from John

April’s mood changes as she tussles with Will over who gets
to roll first

They play the game mostly with hand gestures never speaking
aword They roll the DICE on a soft blanket so that it
doesn’t make a sound

Will is five spaces away from landing on April’s BOARDWALK
He silently prays for a miracle

Will rolls a five
He throws up his hands in protest

April lets out a GIGGLE The first sound we’ve heard this
whole time --

JOHN’S EYES WIDEN APRIL COVERS HER MOUTH

EVERYONE GETS DEADLY STILL AFRAID

AND THEN WE HEAR IT

A SCREAM IN THE DISTANCE IT IS NOT HUMAN
The family exchanges worried glances

John edges over to the window watching the horizon for any
sign of movement Nothing

THEN THE SCREAM SLOWLY STARTS TO MOVE AWAY
April removes her hand from her mouth
Everyone starts to relax

They go back to playing Monopoly in silence

TITLE A QUIET PLACE
EXT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The farmhouse sits in moonlight A thin fog hovers just above
the ground All the lights are off

The family dog is tied outside It stirs awake Focuses on
the wall of corn lining the backyard

Tries to bark through the MUZZLE but can’t

EXT CORN FIELD - NIGHT

There are no crickets or insects of any kind Just an
unnatural silence that hangs in the air

AND THEN SOMETHING MOVES

STALKS OF CORN WHIP AND BEND AS A LARGE FORM MANEUVERS
THROUGH THE CROPS

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAWN

Morning The yard is serene and still A heavy layer of frost
covers the grass

INT FARMHOUSE HALL - MORNING

April’s tiny face peeks out into the hall She wipes the
sleep from her eyes

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - MORNING

April lifts the toilet seat There’s no water inside the
bowl just a red BIOHAZARD BAG curled around the rim

She pees into the bag and her face goes from agony to relief

INT FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - MORNING
April descends the BASEMENT STAIRS with the biohazard bag

There is a NAIL sticking up about ten steps down and if
someone were to step on it

it would REALLY REALLY HURT

APRIL’S FOOT COMES DOWN ON THE NAIL but just misses it
She disposes of the biohazard bag in a DEEP HOLE cut into the
basement floor She heads back to the stairs but something
stops her

An old WORKBENCH cluttered with family PHOTOS from ages ago

April glances at a POLAROID of a TEENAGE GIRL braces dark
eyes beautiful She’s hugging April They’re both laughing

The Polaroid seems to be attached to a PAINFUL MEMORY And
like everything in this basement it has the look of
something that was abandoned long ago

A HAND TOUCHES APRIL’S SHOULDER

John is standing behind his daughter April doesn’t look
over Doesn’t react

If we hadn’t noticed before we realize now that there is an
enormous amount of tension between them

April’s face starts to quiver Tears filling her eyes She
pushes her father’s hand away and leaves

John opens his mouth as if to say something but of course
he can’t

EXT VALLEY - MORNING

John has a LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder He leads
Will down a steep trail into a lake valley

As they walk we may or may not notice how they always

) Avoid dry leaves and sticks

) Walk heel to toe

) Distribute their weight evenly

) Keep their arms close to their sides

) Breathe steadily

) Match the cadence of each other’s gait

DU BPWNHE

EXT LAKE - MORNING

Will sits into a small ROW-BOAT with no paddles He hides his
trembling hands Doesn’t want his father to know he’s scared

John sits behind him and gazes at the placid water
A layer of RED ALGAE covers the entire basin It is thick and

milky along the shore where the SKELETONS of cows horses
and fish waste away

There’s a long ROPE that extends from one side of the lake to
the other It’s been secured to a post on each end and pulled
taught hanging no more than a few inches above the surface

The men begin pulling themselves along the rope slowly at
first careful not to disrupt or splash the water in any way

Their boat glides across the calm lake gaining momentum
heading to a SMALL GROVE OF TREES on the other side

EXT WELL - MORNING

Under the trees rests a WATER WELL made of laid stones

John shines a MINI-FLASHLIGHT into the well The beam fades
into darkness unable to reach the bottom

John begins pulling a bungee cable that’s looped through a
pulley system

Sixty feet below a LEATHER BUCKET envelopes a gallon of
water and as the bungee is pulled the leather cinches
itself closed trapping any leaking water

Will opens the duffle and removes four COLLAPSIBLE WATER
CONTAINERS

They begin the process of painstakingly filling each of the
containers with water from the well

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

April is lying outside the farmhouse writing in her DIARY
Her HEARING AID is removed

She flips the page and stifles a scream Inside is a DRAWING

A DARK RED CREATURE SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON ANIMAL YET
OTHERWORLDLY BLOOD POOLED AROUND ITS LEGS

Her brother smirks as he hauls two WATER CONTAINERS across
the yard April is not amused by Will’s prank She plugs her
HEARING AID back into her ear

INT FARMHOUSE DEN - DAY

Mia crosses off another day on her CALENDAR We see that
she’s still several weeks out from her DUE DATE

She glances outside the window - sees the boys heading toward
the SHED with the WELL WATER
EXT PORCH - DAY
Mia wanders outside to the back porch Her eyes narrow

THE DOG IS GONE THE END OF THE LEASH FRAYED AS IF TORN

INT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Mia searches everywhere for the dog An impossible task when
you can’t hear your pet and your pet can’t hear you

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - DAY

Mia stops at the top of the stairs She cringes feels a
small pang in her stomach It passes

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Outside April crumples up the drawing Her eyes trained on
the SHED as its doors sway in the wind She approaches

INT SHED - DAY

April’s tiny hands open the large shed doors and we see
inside for the first time

In the center is a CRIB with a MOBILE hanging over it The

surrounding walls are built like a bomb shelter of sorts -
heavily reinforced with sound dampening materials Much like

the farmhouse but more extreme

they’ve been preparing for the baby’s arrival for months

INT FARMHOUSE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY

Mia gets down on all fours and peers under April’s bed She
sees something that puzzles her Takes a moment to register

The POLAROID OF THE TEENAGE GIRL from the basement is buried
under a pile of clothes Mia examines it for a moment then
places it back

Mia moves to the hall She staggers a little Feels dizzy
INT SHED - DAY

April sets down her DIARY Tries to get Will’s attention but
the boys are focused on a WATER CHART

They are TWENTY GALLONS shy of their TARGET GOAL

We see other CHARTS and LISTS around the shed specifying
food and supply rations that would roughly last the infancy
period of a child

John notices one of the SOUND PROOF SHEETS has fallen off the
wall The glue has come undone in the heat revealing OLD
NEWSPAPERS that have been fused to the wall with paper-mache

We catch a glimpse at a headline
CROW MIGRATION THREATENS HARVEST SEASON
John encourages April to help hang the fallen sheet back up

She refuses

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - DAY

Close on Mia’s face as all the blood drains from it As all
SOUND fades around her As her heart begins to pound against
her chest AS HER WATER BREAKS AS FLUIDS FROM THE AMNIOTIC
SAC FLOOD DOWN HER LEGS AND FEET

She gasps in disbelief It’s too soon They’re not ready

Mia stumbles down the hall Grabs a towel holds it between
her legs With her free hand she HITS A BREAKER ON THE W --
Int EXT VARIOUS - DAY

all over the farmhouse POWERFUL RED FLOODLIGHTS turn on

INT SHED - DAY

But her family can’t see the lights from inside the shed

Unaware John and Will carefully drive nails into the wood
walls silently suspending the fallen SHEET

They then turn their attention to the corner where DOZENS
more sound proof sheets sit in a pile ready to be hung up

INT FARMHOUSE HALL - DAY

Mia staggers toward the bathroom Every step takes
extraordinary effort

INT SHED - LATER

John and Will hang each sheet from the pile One by one The
process is SLOW and DILIGENT with no room for error

April teases Will while he works He pushes her away A
little too hard She frowns her feelings hurt

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

Mia sits in a BATH TUB Her face red Doing everything she
can to not make a sound Fighting an immense amount of pain
INT SHED - LATER STILL

John stands on a LADDER fastening a sheet to the ceiling
About half the stack has been put up

When no one is looking April pulls one of the sheets off the
wall She smiles to herself almost wants to get caught but
no one sees her

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

Mia’s contractions increase

INT SHED - EVEN LATER

The sun is lower in the sky Much progress has been made on
the walls and ceiling which are now 60 covered in sound
proofing

April wanders past THREE BUNKS one for John and Mia one for
Will and one for herself April’s bunk is half-decorated
with STICKERS and a Wizard of Oz SCARECROW plush toy

April grabs a PILLOW from her bed Looks to her brother
mischievously

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Mia grips the side of the tub as --

INT SHED - AFTERNOON

April SMACKS Will with the pillow He’s in no mood He fights
back John breaks them up scolds April Points at his
daughter motioning for her to leave

April sulks away angry Steps outside the shed and STOPS
She sees the RED FLOOD LIGHTS ARE ON She panics runs back
to the shed and grabs her father He starts to get scared
when he realizes how scared she is

EXT FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON

John runs across the lawn as fast as he can Throws the front
door open No time for shoe covers

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

Sprints up the stairs

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Finds his wife in the bathtub She’s in labor

EXT SHED - AFTERNOON
Will and April run off in the opposite direction of the

farmhouse It’s as if they’ve been rehearsing for this moment
for months

EXT WOODS - AFTERNOON

They enter a small patch of forest Fast as they can

EXT WOODS PATH - AFTERNOON

April trips and falls Will doesn’t stop to help her

INT WOODS HORSE STALL - AFTERNOON

Will lunges into an empty horse stall He tips over a TOOL
BOX and grabs a pack of MATCHES

INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Mia’s face is flush and sweaty A pool of blood surrounds
her She breathes heavy as

A NEWBORN BABY BEGINS TO CRY --

EXT WOODS PATH - AFTERNOON

-- April gets very still She turns up the VOLUME on her
hearing aid

Just faintly through the high frequency static we hear the
baby CRYING in the distance

April stifles her breathing

The sound of SOMETHING else continues breathing behind her

OUT OF FOCUS JUST TEN FEET AWAY WE SEE IT MOVE SLOWLY
TOWARDS THE SOUNDS
INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

Mia takes the crying baby in her arms She covers it with a
FLEECE BLANKET trying to dampen the cries

John looks out the window at the shed Wondering how to get
there safely

AND THAT’S WHEN THEY HEAR THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKING
DOWNSTAIRS SOMETHING IS INSIDE THE HOUSE WITH THEM

Tears stream down Mia’s face A look that says “It’s too
late We’re already dead”

EXT WOODS TRACTOR - AFTERNOON

Will arrives at his destination Out of breath and sweating
He reaches under a RUSTED-OUT TRACTOR searching for

something His hand sweeps back and forth

-we see a BLACK FUSE just barely out of reach His fingers
getting

closer
closer

CLOSER

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The FOOTSTEPS creep up the stairs Nails scrape and click
against the wood They don’t sound human

EXT WOODS TRACTOR - AFTERNOON
Will reaches as far as he possibly can

-grabs the FUSE and LIGHTS IT It takes The spark
disappears under the tractor

Will immediately starts running back to the house

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The FOOTSTEPS stop at the top of the stairs We can hear the

creature BREATHING now Wheezy and hollow like air slowly
being sucked through a straw

Mia and John stand frozen too afraid to move They are
staring at THE SILHOUETTE OF A NIGHTMARE

IT STANDS ON FOUR LEGS HUNCHED LOW PREDATORY AND DANGEROUS

ITS SKIN DEEP DARK RED - THE COLOR OF DRIED BLOOD

THERE ARE NO EYES ON THE MONSTER’S FACE AND AS IT SAUNTERS

TOWARD JOHN AND MIA WE REALIZE IT CANNOT SEE THEM IT SIMPLY

HEARS THE BABY’S MUFFLED CRIES

THE CREATURE’S JAW UNHINGES AND THEN --

-- BA-BOOM

EXT CORN FIELD - AFTERNOON

FIREWORKS EXPLODE over the crops

April looks up startled at first Then smiles Will pulled
it off
INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON

The creature retreats downstairs pursuing the loud noises
outside

EXT WOODS PATH - AFTERNOON

Will races back towards the farmhouse Fireworks igniting in
the background as he runs It would be beautiful if it
weren’t so terrifying

EXT CORN FIELD WEATHER VANE - AFTERNOON

Deep in the corn field April kneels at the base of an iron
WEATHER VANE that points back toward the farmhouse

She plugs a RED CABLE into the back of a SPEAKER BOX and
BOOM A small electrical explosion knocks her unconscious
EXT PORCH - AFTERNOON

Mia and John sneak the newborn out the back

Mia moves in slow pained steps She struggles to stand on
two legs but musters all her courage to continue

John motions for Mia to make a run for the shed He signals a
silent countdown with his fingers

three

-two

«- One

MIA RUNS FOR IT

EXT GRASS FIELD - AFTERNOON

Will peels away a patch of TALL GRASS revealing a GREY BOX
He flips a switch on the box

A RED LIGHT turns on and --

INT SHED - AFTERNOON
-- a series of MEDICAL MACHINES roar to life inside the shed

Mia attaches a BREATHING MASK to the infant’s face and places
it in the crib carefully draping blankets over the baby

INT FARMHOUSE DEN - AFTERNOON

John sneaks through the den Grabs his MP3 PLAYER Unplugs
the HEADPHONES

INT SHED - AFTERNOON

Will slips into the shed and DEAD BOLTS one door Leaves the
second open

EXT FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON

John comes out the front door --

THE MONSTER STANDS BETWEEN HIM AND THE SHED

BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FAMILY

John looks to his NEWBORN BABY

His eyes well with joy and fear

Mia tries to muffle the weeping infant

The monster senses their presence but can’t quite place
their exact location

John walks slowly but urgently to the shed as --
THE WIND STARTS BLOWING

THE LEAVES OF THE TREES BEND AND RATTLE

IT DISGUISES THE SOUNDS OF JOHN’S FOOTSTEPS

JOHN CLOSES HIS EYES

FOCUSING ALL OF HIS ENERGY

DOING HIS BEST TO NOT MAKE A SINGLE SOUND

THIS IS THE LONGEST WALK OF HIS LIFE

John is 30 feet away from the shed

20 feet away

10 feet
oa
--- SNAP

John looks down in horror A BROKEN TWIG under his foot
The creature whips around Rears up
JOHN RUNS FOR IT --

THE MONSTER SCREAMS --

INT SHED - AFTERNOON

MIA PULLS JOHN INSIDE JUST BEFORE THE MONSTER LUNGES WILL
SLAMS THE DOOR CLOSED DEAD BOLTS THE LOCK

JOHN RUNS TO THE BACK OF THE SHED PLUGS THE MP3 PLAYER INTO

THE WALL FLIPS A SWITCH --

EXT GRASS FIELD - AFTERNOON
The light on the GREY BOX turns GREEN and then we hear

MUSIC

EXT CORN FIELD WEATHER VANE - AFTERNOON

coming from the SPEAKER BOX at the base of the weather
vane

EXT SHED - AFTERNOON

The creature retreats from the shed toward the sounds

EXT HILLTOP - AFTERNOON

High above rolling hills under day-blue sky The farmhouse
just a dot on the horizon

MUSIC reverberates off the walls of the empty valley

We hear a HORRIFYING ROAR and then just as soon as it
started the music goes SILENT

Now just wind

Wind pulsing through dry corn stalks

The rustles and whispers of dead silence

INT SHED - AFTERNOON
The FAMILY holds each other Emotional and raw
John pulls away from their tight embrace slowly realizing

HIS DAUGHTER IS NOT WITH THEM

John runs to the door but it’s JAMMED
He pushes as hard as he can LOUDLY shoving the padded frame

Just when the door is about to BURST Mia grabs John She
pulls him back as the MONSTROUS FORM returns outside

LISTENING AND WAITING
FOR EVEN THE

FAINTEST

LITTLE

SOUND

FADE TO

DARKNESS

A bird CHIRPS Benign at first growing louder A single
WARBLE Then many We see --

THOUSANDS OF CROWS Filling the screen with their dimension
and sound Billowing like an OMINOUS BLACK CLOUD over --

Recently planted CROPS The crows descend upon fresh SEEDS
Annihilating the soil Lightening quick glimpses of --

A Young April Before she had a HEARING AID She smiles --

Her father John places a SCARECROW in the field He wipes
sweat from his forehead We see --

The TEENAGE GIRL FROM THE POLAROID She picks April up into
her arms --

APRIL (VO)
How come you and daddy don’t talk
anymore

We’re not sure if this is DREAM or MEMORY or SOMETHING ELSE
entirely and before we can comprehend --

A HUGE CONCUSSIVE BLAST

SECOND ACT

EXT CORN FIELD WEATHER VANE - NIGHT

April’s eyes snap open

She climbs out from under a pile of dead corn husks

She is alone Long deep shadows fall in the maze of corn that
surrounds her Every direction looks exactly the same An

eerie chill permeates the cold night air

Nearby we see the monster’s warpath The SPEAKER BOX is TORN
TO SHREDS Wires and circuits everywhere

April lifts what’s left of the WEATHER VANE At one time it
pointed right back at the farmhouse But now

She aims it FORWARD A
doesn’t seem right
She aims it LEFT
-that’s not it

She aims it BACKWARDS V
--oh no

April is completely lost

INT SHED - NIGHT

Mia is asleep next to Will The newborn lies on her chest
John is kneeled on the other side of the small shed

His eyes trained on the wall

Peering through the razor-thin slats
24

Focusing on the DARK SHAPE that waits outside The shape is
backlit by moonlight and from the look on John’s face it
has been idle now for several minutes

John stands up and thinks it over Goes to the shed door
Puts his fingers on the HANDLE

Loses his nerve

EXT CORN FIELD - NIGHT

April maneuvers through an endless harvest tract Nothing but
crops disappearing into blackness

She slows to a stop

Looks deep into the darkest path

She inhales

And her throat closes

One hundred paces away from where she stands nestled between
two rows of corn is a MAN STARING RIGHT BACK AT HER

INT SHED - NIGHT

John sits on Aprils bunk biding his time until the monster

is gone He nervously squeezes her scarec plush toy as he
studies a hand-written list titled K5j

May 17 perso

‘
beast John shakes it off Doesnt have time to think about
how fucked they are

He kneels before the shed door Tries to look underneath
where the frame meets the dirt

All he can see is grass and a LONG SHADOW
He lowers his head closer

Places his cheek to the ground

THE SHADOW MOVES

John lets outa GASP His breath kicks up a tiny cloud of
dust

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING
John is frozen like a statue His mouth open a little
He stays like that for a long time

John carefully moves back to the wall He looks through the
slats once more

The DARK SHAPE has vanished from view

John wipes sweat from his forehead The silence grows heavy
and then --

THERE’S SUDDEN MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE SOUND OF RUSTLING GRASS

John jerks back startled Hits his head on a tie-beam
creating the slightest THWAP and --

WE HEAR A HORRIBLE HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK IN RESPONSE WHALING
LOUD EVEN THROUGH FOURTEEN INCHES OF REINFORCED SOUND PROOF
PADDING and then BOOOOOOOOM the far wall shakes as a clawed
hand comes down hard from outside

The entire FAMILY jolts awake

EXT CORN FIELD - NIGHT

April’s shoulders graze stalks of leaves as she moves toward
the figure whose stark form remains threateningly still

She’s not exhaling

Not even a breath

She takes the last few steps to the figure
She waves at him

No response

His eyes sunken and dark His body rocks back and forth as
if agitated

April reaches for him

She pulls a piece of STRAW from the outline of a SCARECROW

INT SHED - NIGHT
John and Will frantically patch a ten inch PUNCTURE HOLE with

sound proofing material The sheets are now ripped back
revealing AGED NEWSPAPER HEADLINES we didn’t see before --

EMERGENCY UN MEETING — GLOBAL MASSACRE LEAVES BILLIO)
MILITARY EFFORTS FAIL INAMERICA ASIA END OF CIVILIZATO

The breach is sealed and John covers the make-shift mend with
a MATTRESS

He stops Looks at his hands

THEY’RE WET

HE SEES

WATER

EVERYWHERE

POOLING

WHERE THE WALL MEETS THE GROUND

THE DIRT FLOOR DRINKING UP EVERY LAST DROP OF LEAKING WATER

THEIR ENTIRE SUPPLY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY THE CREATURE‘S
BLOW TO THE WALL

Will grabs a CARTON and places it under one of the damaged
WATER CONTAINERS trying to collect the runoff

drip
drip
drip
drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip

John KNOCKS the carton away The DRIPPING SOUND is too loud
could get them killed

They watch helplessly as their stock goes from
TWELVE GALLONS to THREE

Mia motions to John trying to engage him - trying to
understand what’s going on
27

John is catatonic
Doesnt know what to do or say
Doesnt know how to keep his family sare

Will taps his father on the back snapping him out of hig
trance

Will points to a SKYLIGHT in the ceiling

Johns head pokes out of the small SKYLIGHT HATCH on top of
the shed roof

Its so cold outside he can see his breath

INT SHED - NIGHT

John climbs back down intc the shed He nods at Will
thanking him

John has an idea He quickly unpacks a MONOPOLY set onto the
floor He offers his family one of the eight PEWTER TOKENS

Will chooses the RACE CAR
Mia chooses the THIMBLE
And John chooses the TOP HAT

John places the three tokens in FREE PARKING and in BLACK
MARKER writes Qugp

The nearby ILLINOIS AVENUE space becomes House

The blank area where the COMMUNITY CHEST cards go becomes AKE
Further down the board where the CHANCE cards go becomes ALLEY
And faraway on the other side BOARDWALK becomes TURBINE

John has converted this
Same board into a make-shift MAP
EXT CORN FIELD CLEARING - NIGHT
April carries the SCARECROW through the harvest tract

Her face is looking pale from the cold Her fingers are
purple and stiff

April sets the SCARECROW down and begins removing its
CLOTHES

ELKSKIN WORK GLOVES

FLANNEL JACKET

AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

Underneath the clothes attached to the scarecrow’s spine is
a SIGNAL GENERATOR a small device used for generating
electronic sounds It appears broken with thin circuits that

unravel from each side and a frequency DIAL that ranges from
a few kilohertz (kHz) to hundreds of gigahertz (GHz)

it has the look of something that was abandoned long ago
April shivers

She puts on the GLOVES JACKET and SUNGLASSES

INT SHED - NIGHT
The family studies the Monopoly board

John picks up the THIMBLE (Mia) and slides it to the space
labeled

John looks to his wife Mia nods

John picks up the RACE CAR (Will) and slides it to the space
labeled LAKE

John looks to his son Will takes a breath Very afraid Bur
he nods too

John picks up the TOP HAT (John) and slides it all the way to
the other side of the board to the space labeled TURBINE

Misa and Will react Their concerned faces betray a deep FEAR
of that side of the board

Mia takes the TOP HAT (John) and moves it closer to the
space labeled VA

Will nods in agreement

John shrugs Wreatles with the idea internally Decides hes
not okay with that

John stands the MARKER upright on TURBINE creating a TOWER
He places the TOP HAT (John) on the tip of the marker He
gestures as if to suggest a high vantage point that looka
down over the valley

Mia and Will dont seem to care Theyve already made up
their mind

Mia takes the TOP HAT (John) and returns it right back to
VALLEY

John concedes Hes been outvoted
Everyone looks long and hard at the board
They have a plan

EXT CORN FIELD TREE - NIGHT

April sits in a TREE that hangs above the crop line Her eyes
fixed on the top of a GRAIN SILO in the faraway distance

She blinks Makes up her mind That’s where she’s headed

April climbs down to the dismantled SCARECROW

Her arms and legs feel heavy She looks like a stranger in
her oversized attire Her mind starts to drift

Just then

Nearby

Only a few yards away
A CROW CAWS

April looks up startled

The CAWING continues all around her Or is it in her mind

We hear a displaced VOICE feminine and soft

VOICE (VO)
Can you tell Dad that I’m not a

child anymore

FLASHBACK EXT CORN FIELD SCARECROW - DAY

The voice belongs to April’s sister IRIS fka teenager
from the Polaroid She’s in a heated argument with John

IRIS

---and that I can go out with my
friends whenever I want

Young April relays to John as if he didn’t hear Iris

APRIL
Iris says “She’s not a child
anymore and can go out --”
APRIL

Dad says “As long as you act
like a child --”

JOHN
Can you tell your sister that
as long as she keeps acting
like a child she’s going to
be treated like a child

IRIS
Tell dad that he’s the one
acting like a child and that
it’s ridiculous that he won’t
talk to me because I forgot
to cover the seeds last week

APRIL JOHN
Iris says “Youre the one Tell your sister that she
acting like a child — needs to take responsibility

for her actions and that by
forgetting to cover the
seeds she may have cast us
an entire harvest season

IRIs
Tell Dad he doesn’t get to suddenly
take an interest in my life when
hes NEVER had anything to say to
me before and that I’m not having
this conversation right now

JOHN
Tell your sister she’s not doing
ANYTHING right now because shes
grounded

John removes his ELKSKIN GLOVES and AVIATOR SUNGLASSES ancl
FLANNEL JACKET and dresses them on the SCARECROW

IRIS
Can I at least help with the
ecarecrows
John walks away

IRIS
Dad

It’s quiet for a moment then fris places SOMETHING inside
the POCKET of the FLANNEL JACKET

BACK TO

April opens the POCKET of the FLANNEL JACKET She removes a
handful of BUTTON PINS each with a unique design

A tear rolls down April‘s face from under her sunglasses

She stands for a moment in the pale moonlight wearing the
CLOTHES of her FATHER

Shes taken by an overwhelming sense of loneliness

She fights her feelings at first but eventually surrenders
to the sadness
SHE WEEPS
A DEEP MOURNING THAT QUIETLY GROWS IN INTENSITY --
EXPLODING INTO --
A SOFT WHIMPER --
JUST AS --
She cups her hand over her mouth
Almost forgot how dangerous it is to cry
April composes herself

She begins her long journey to the GRAIN SILO

EXT SHED ROOF - DAWN

John looks out from the SKYLIGHT HATCH

The sun is just starting to climb over the horizon Its warm
light spilling down onto the field of crops giving the corn
a yellow glow

John carefully hoists himself onto the SHED ROOF He scans
the yard for any sign of movement

Nothing

The yard appears completely EMPTY

John moves back to the hatch and gives Will a thumbs up
Will climbs onto the shed roof

The men close the hatch

John carefully lowers himself over the rim of the roof His
hands clinging precariously to LOOSE SHINGLE

He doesn’t see the STAPLE that snags his shirt so much as he
hears it

the fabric beginning to RIP

John tries to steady himself

But his fingers are slipping on the rough surface all the
way to the edge dangling there suspended ten feet off the
ground The more he slips the LOUDER the shirt gets

Will tries to un-snag the shirt from the staple but it only
makes MORE NOISE To us it’s no louder than a whisper - but
to the monster it could be DEAFENING

John’s hands begin to shake His face turns red He’s using
all of his strength not to shift further down

Desperate Will pulls off one of the rotted shingle TILES and
uses the jagged corner to cut the speared fabric It works

The shirt goes slack

Just as the SHINGLES are about to give John releases his
grip and falls silently to the ground

But it’s too late --

AN ENTIRE ROW OF TILES COMES SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF AFTER HIM
John catches each tile One by one Just barely

John and Will look at each other

That was close

EXT CORN FIELD - MORNING

John and Will walk in opposite directions through the corn
field

EXT VALLEY - MORNING

Will has the LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder It’s
almost twice his size

He nervously maneuvers the steep trail that leads into the
LAKE VALLEY It’s the first time he has ever done this alone

INT SHED - MORNING

Inside the shed Mia watches her sleeping newborn hold the
Monopoly DICE in its tiny hand

She notices something under the crib Its APRIL’S DIARY Mia
flips to the first page and reada

4e cw fi se iv yory vey cant

Mia tries to smile but can’t She closes the diary

She moves to the far wall and begins the difficult process of
FIXING THE DOOR JAM

EXT CORN FIELD WEATHER VANE - MORNING

John stops dead in his tracks Cant believe what he sees

The SPEAKER BOX and WEATHER VANE lay in pieces beneath his
feet

He frantically searches around
No sign of April

Starts to assume the worst
John lifts the weather vane

Aims it BACK AT THE FARMHOUSE

EXT LAKE - MORNING
Will stands at the edge of the lake He is trembling

The small ROW-BOAT rocks gently in the still water Will
approaches places the duffle inside

But he can’t bring himself to get in the boat
He’s too afraid

EXT CORN FIELD — DAY

April moves toward the GRAIN SILO in the distance She feels
herself getting hungry

April shucks an EAR OF CORN and bites into it It’s raw but
nourishing She takes an even bigger bite
-SPITS IT OUT Realizes the maize is INFESTED WITH WORMS
April tosses the sweet corn
It lands with a THUD
JUST THEN WE HEAR AN IDENTICAL THUD BEHIND HER
That’s odd
April turns up the VOLUME on her hearing aid
She hears stalks of corn MOVING
THE CREATURE
April hides under a PATCH OF OVERGROWN WEEDS
We hear the RUSTLING SOUNDS approaching
they are so faint
you almost
can’t even
hear them
AND THEN --

JOHN APPEARS FROM THE WALL OF CROPS

He walks right past his daughter who remains motionless
hidden under leaves and grass

Both father and daughter completely unaware of how close
they were to finding each other
INT SHED - DAY

Mia has REPAIRED the shed doors She cautiously swings them
open Glances at the FARMHOUSE

Checks to make sure the baby is still asleep then slips out
the door

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY
Mia carefully crosses the lawn

Doesn’t realize the REPAIRED DOOR didn’t shut all the way

INT FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Mia enters the farmhouse Dust hangs in the air There’s
something unsettling about being back Knowing the monster
could be anywhere Even inside her home

She starts packing as much FOOD as she can find APPLES
POTATOES WALNUTS TOMATOES

EXT CORN FIELD - DAY

April climbs out of hiding Dusts herself off Keeps moving

We hear RUSHING WATER ahead

EXT CREEK - DAY

The last obstacle separating April from the GRAIN SILO is a
raging FRESHWATER CREEK

There’s a series of BOULDERS that form a dangerous path
across April maneuvers over with relative ease

EXT SILO - DAY

She arrives at the base of a 40 ft steel SILO used for bulk
storage of grain A STAIRCASE spirals around the structure to
the roof

April doesn’t notice the graffiti scratched into the wall

Why are they here

And then in different handwriting an answer

TO SHUT US THE FUDK LP

EXT SILO ROOF — DAY

April tops the stairs and crawls up the sloped tower to a
PLATFORM on the center of the roof

The platform feels a little unstable Rusted metal CREAKS and
GROANS dangerously beneath her feet

She scans the entire horizon Realizes shes never been this
far away from home before DOESNT RECOGNIZE ANY LANDMARKS IN
THE DISTANCE

Hopelessness starts to creep in It’s a suffocating feeling -
like the steady ring of silence all around her

April looks tc her feet Sees an IRON ROD protruding from the
platform She gets an idea

She wrestles the iron rod free The platform moves slightly

She positions the rod upright in the center of the platform
and we start to comprehend what her plan might be

The rod casts a long SHADOW April marks the very tip of the
shadow with her

She waits several moments As the sun travels the rod‘s
shadow starts to move to the right

April marks the new tip of the shedow with her

April is creating a SUNDIAL COMPASS in order to find
NORTH
EXT LAKE - DAY

Will is halfway across the lake And for a moment he thinks
he sees SOMETHING UNDER HIS BOAT

The water is murky with RED ALGAE

Impossible to see anything clearly
Maybe it’s nothing

Don’t be afraid

There

Is

Nothing

Under

Your

Boat

Will steadies his SHAKING HANDS summoning all of his
courage as he pulls himself along the ROPE

INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - DAY

Mia’s arms are full of FOOD She’s about to leave for the
SHED when --

INT FARMHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

-- something grabs her attention

The POLAROID OF APRILS SISTER IRIS poking out from under
the bed

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Now holding the POLAROID and FOOD Mia makes her way back to
the SHED

Wait the DOORS are open
WIDE OPEN

BOTH SHED DOORS WIDE FUCKING OPEN NO NO NO NO NO NO --
THE WORST IMAGINABLE
THING HAS HAPPENED

THE CREATURE IS INSIDE THE SHED

Mia goes white

Looks to her BABY

The infant is about to WAKE UP

THE BABY WIGGLES YAWNS INTO ITS BREATHING MASK

The monster doesn’t move It has no idea Mia is here In

fact it probably has no idea where “here” even is But the
second it figures it out it’s ALL GOING TO BE OVER

Mia removes her shoes Tip-toes to the crib One foot
precisely placed in front of the other Lifts her newborn

THE MONSTER STIRS SENSING SOMETHING

Mia carries her baby out of the shed mouthing “Shhhhh” the
whole way as the baby’s eyes

--BLINK OPEN

INT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Mia rushes the waking baby into the house

INT FARMHOUSE DEN - DAY

Through the den

INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

Through the living room

INT BASEMENT - DAY

Into the basement

Down the stairs

MIA STEPS ON THE WAIDLSE1111

STABBING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TENDON AND MUSCLE
MIA RECOILS

WRITHES IN PAIN
4l

WANTS TO SCREAM
ALMOST FALLS

BUT SHE IS UNBELIEVABLY FUCKING TOUGH AND NOT ABOUT TO LET
THIS BE THE END OF HER BABY’S LIFE

Mia hobblea the reat of the way down leaving BLOTCHES OF RED
on the steps behind her

She hides the infant underneath the WORK BENCH

Then moves to a row of small windows that run across the top
of the walls They look out to the back yard

WHICH APPEARS EMPTY

BECAUSE

WE HEAR A LOW STACCATO CLICKING NOISE UPSTAIRS

INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

A LONG SHADOW snakes through the living room The creatures
CLICKING NOISE reverberates off the walls and furniture

The rate of pulses increases building to a terminal buzz of
200 clicks per second until --

The shadow stops at the top of the basement stairs And
releases a deep malevolent ULTRASOUND

EXT SILO ROOF — DAY

The sun is high in the sky

April sees the TRON RODS
She marks the new tip with her

She stands perpendicular to the trio of BUTTONS creating a
straight line revealing NORTH

The platform GROANS ominously as she settles into place

She looks ahead And then as if to confirm her findings
something appears on the far horizon

BLACK SMOKE RISING OVER THE CROPS --

EXT GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

-- we find John fanning a small FIRE He has made a SMOKE
SIGNAL for April

EXT SILO ROOF - DAY

Relief washes over April’s face She recognizes the pattern
in the smoke Knows it’s her father

She dismantles her sundial Collects the BUTTONS into her
pocket

Takes a HARD STEP on the platform and --
THE RUSTED METAL BUCKLES --

SUDDEN AND EXPLOSIVE --

AS SHE FALLS INTO THE SILO --

AND LETS OUT A SCREAM

INT FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - DAY

-- which ECHOES ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE DEAD AIR TO THE
FARMHOUSE

Mia hears the FOOTSTEPS above her suddenly retreat from the
house

She looks out the window in time to glimpse the creature
running off into the crops

Mia grabs the baby and hobbles back to the shed

EXT GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

John puts out the FIRE Notices CORN STALKS crackling with
movement

EXT WELL - DAY

Will who is now retrieving WATER out of the well hears the
monster’s ROAR reverberate all around him

INT SILO - DAY

April lands on her stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP on the
layer of ROTTEN GRAIN that fills this structure

It is 140°F inside the steel silo And there are MAGGOTS and
WORMS everywhere

April looks up to the broken platform

She can almost reach it

April tries to stand

BUT HER ANKLES BEGIN TO SINK

THE GRAIN IS LIKE QUICK SAND

THE MORE SHE MOVES THE DEEPER SHE DROWNS

UNTIL HER ENTIRE BODY IS SUBMERGED

AND WE CAN NO LONGER SEE HER FACE

THE 80000 BUSHEL GRAIN BIN DEVOURS APRIL ALIVE

Five seconds That is how quickly someone can become engulfed
in flowing grain and unable to get out

Thirty seconds That is how quickly someone can be completely
submerged in flowing grain and suffocate

Zero That is how many people can survive being buried under
grain without air for a few minutes
EXT GRAVEL ROAD - AFTERNOON

John sprints after the movement in the crops

INT SILO - AFTERNOON

April’s body thrashes in the dark Fleeting trickles of light
come through as the grain stirs but it’s mostly BLACK

April takes huge desperate breaths She tries to swim to the
top The grain wraps her body tighter with every movement

SOUNDS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD START TO FADE AWAY

A tiny shaft of light punches through just long enough for us
to glimpse WORMS crawling into April’s hair and clothes

the least of her problems

Because she’s starting to die There’s no oxygen left to
breathe Her esophagus is only gulping down heavy grain

All we hear now is the SOFT LULL OF ASPHYXIATION It sounds
like marbles grinding in a glass jar

BOOOOOM
Pounding
BOOOOOM
Outside On the walls
BOOOOOM

Again The pounding grows louder and more intense It travels
through the grain like a distorted sonic --

The wall RUPTURES below Grain starts spilling outside April
is carried with the current edging closer and closer to the
puncture hole Closer and closer to DAYLIGHT

Someone has saved her Maybe Will Maybe her father

That’s when April hears the HISSING sound behind her head
NOT SOMEONE SOMETHING

She pulls at the grain clawingthrashing flailing her arms
and legs moving to the daylight as fast as she can and we
see --

EXT SILO - LATE AFTERNOON

-- thousands of yellow beads pouring out of ripped steel at
the base of the silo creating a hazy diffusion in the air

April spills into the golden fog
SHE RUNS FOR IT

We hear the familiar sound of RUSHING WATER ahead --
as

April doesn’t look back But if she did she would see the
TERRIFYING ABERRATION pursuing her

GAINING 50 QUICKLY
THAT IT’S ALREADY ON HER HEELS AS SHE

EXT UNDERWATER -— LATE AFTERNOON

April is sucked under the surface

She OPENS HER EYES long enough to glimpse a di

the creature above The monster is confused and searching -
losing its prey in the LOUD ROAR OF THE WATER

April is pulled to safety downstream

But the current is too swift and too strong for her to come
up for air

April flails underwater Shes knocked to one side then
another then sinks to the floor and -——

BAM The back of her head clips a BOULDER

April goes limp Her Unconscious body is carried aimlessly
ream

EXT SILO - SUNSET

John arrives at the broken SILO but its too late He scans
the horizon

The sky is blood red The crops sway hypnotically in an eerie
breeze

John surveys the damage to the silo Something SHINY catches
his eye

He reaches into the spilled grain and finds —

April washes onto a muddy creek bed She’s still unconscious
Her face half submerged in water

THE WATER SHE RESTS IN TURNS RED

Suddenly her arms spasm and twitch

APRIL JOLTS AWAKE

She vomits creek water Heaving and choking Dazed

April crawls out of the water Wipes blood from the back of
her head She takes stock of her new location

She is surrounded by dozens of CHERRY BLOSSOM TREES The
field of WHITE undulates as far as the eye can see

Shes been here before
April stands before the gate of a small GRAVEYARD

INT SHED - NIGHT

Mia pries the NAIL from her foot with tweezers She rubs
alcohol into the wound

Nearby Will stacks two WATER CONTAINERS on the far wall and
adjusts their CHART from

THREE GALLONS to FIVE
Will smiles to himself Proud he faced his fears
Mia glances at APRILS DIARY-

Mia thinks it over Then flips to a random entry

Will rauna up and hugs his father
John moves cover to Mis Kisses the side of her face

John hurries over to the MONOPOLY BOARD

He picks up the TOP HAT (John) and slides it all the way to
ae

FADE TO

John sits in stunned silence

JOHN
I don’t know what’s gotten into

FLASHBACK INT PICKUP - DAY
John drives the girls home Something on his mind --
JOHN
Iris uh I wanted to say well

and maybe I don’t say this enough
But I wanted to say

IRIS

John thinks about what Mia told him How he doesn’t
communicate with his daughter How he never tells her he

loves her He thinks about how this could be that moment

IRIS
What is it

A traffic light up ahead turns yellow John drives right
through it

JOHN
Nevermind It’s nothing

A SPEEDING VAN CUTS THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND BROADSIDES
THEIR TRUCK WITH TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM --

SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
THE TRUCK FLIPS

END OVER END
CRASHING TO A VIOLENT STOP

A silent beat Smoke billows from the hood Glass shards
litter the street

John crawls out of the overturned pickup

JOHN
NO NO

He pulls April out of the wreckage

THIRD ACT

EXT CEMETERY - SUNRISE
April sleeps at the foot of a HEADSTONE marked IRIS WALKER

INT SHED - SUNRISE
Dim sunlight peaks through the cracks of the shed wall

John is focused on a SKETCH of a tower Measurements
scribbled in the margins He checks his math

The sketch is labeled BAD IDEA

John collects TEN 20 ft segments of rope He ties each
segment together creating one long BRAIDED ROPE

Mia privately passes John a NOTE
Vou CANNOT Tear IT
IT WILL KILL You

John crumples the note

He hugs Mia and Will as if he may never see them again John
tries to leave but Will won’t let go

EXT FARMHOUSE - SUNRISE

John crosses the lawn to the farmhouse somber and serious

John goes to a SAFE in the basement The combination is
written on the sketch 12228

Inside the safe we see various NOISY OBJECTS (ie ALARM
CLOCKS WHISTLES CELL PHONES WIND CHIMES)

John gathers three KITCHEN TIMERS into his backpack

INT FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - SUNRISE

John stops by the MARKER BOARD labeled BABY NAMES

He crosses off HOLLY and re-writes IRIS

EXT VALLEY - MORNING

John travels through the valley The backpack around his
shoulders

EXT LAKE - MORNING

John pulls himself across the lake

EXT WELL - MORNING

John reaches inside his backpack for a TIMER He winds the
DIAL Places it on the well It starts counting down

TIMER 1 59 minutes
John inputs the corresponding time into his WRISTWATCH He’s
using the timers as LURES
EXT HILLTOP - DAY

John travels into the deep horizon The scenery is truly
breath-taking

He checks his watch 42 minutes

EXT WIND FARM - DAY

John comes upon a shortgrass prairie He sees a dozen WIND
TURBINES in the distance They each have three PROPELLER
BLADES and make up what is called a WIND FARM

John checks his watch 30 minutes

We sense he’s nervous about the time John unpacks the second
TIMER and winds the dial

TIMER 2 29 minutes
SUDDENLY THE TURBINE PROPELLERS START TO MOVE --

A heavy WIND rips across the field carrying a flurry of DEAD
LEAVES into John’s path

John proceeds cautiously It’s like crossing a MINE FIELD
One wrong step one crunch of foliage could end it all
EXT WIND FARM TURBINE - DAY

John arrives at the base of the nearest WIND TURBINE

He gazes up at the towering structure in front of him It’s a
modern windmill of sorts once used to convert kinetic energy
from the wind into electrical power

Now it’s just an abandoned monolith that stretches an
astounding 330 ft into the sky To put this into
perspective

330 ft

305 ft

20-Story Stat f bibert Turbine at
Skyscraper rial nimi Wind Farm

INT TURBINE BASE - DAY

John climbs into the turbine Leaves the door WIDE OPEN

The first thing we notice are the DEAD BODIES Probably WIND
TECHNICIANS slaughtered by the monster long ago They are

decomposing The smell of rotten flesh is unbearable

They have one important thing in common - their necks are
broken and all of their VOCAL CORDS have been ripped out

Above is a mostly HOLLOW TUNNEL with a single LADDER that
runs all the way to the top of the tubular steel tower

The tower itself is bisected by 3 platforms along the way
each with a GATE that can be opened or closed

John is nervous Keeps checking his watch The journey took
longer than planned

He sets the final TIMER and starts to climb the ladder

TIMER 3 22 minutes
By the way it takes approximately 30 minutes to climb the

Statue of Liberty so if John wants to get to the top of this
turbine before the timers go off he needs to HAUL ASS

INT SHED - DAY

COME IN ON WILL’S STRICKEN EYES Reeling Shock doesn’t even
begin to explain what he’s seeing

His hands hold a SEGMENT OF BRAIDED ROPE that John somehow
left behind

Mia sees it too Can’t believe it Wonders for a moment what
they can do Decides there’s nothing they can do

Will runs the ROPE to the shed door prepared to bring it to
John Mia BLOCKS him Too dangerous

Will backs away His heart pounds No time to think

EXT SHED ROOF - DAY
Will opens the hatch on the roof and climbs out

Mia watches in horror

INT TURBINE PLATFORM ONE - DAY

John is halfway up the turbine It is COMPLETELY DARK up here
except for the light coming through the doorway below

John shuts and locks the LADDER GATE on platform one It
closes with a faint CLINK noise a threatening reminder to
stay QUIET

Keeps climbing He’s moving fast but each footstep ECHOES
loudly in the chamber tempering his escalation

A NOTE about Wind Turbines people who ascend the central
ladder in any other context would only do so if they were
properly HARNESSED TO A SAFETY CABLE because to fall while
climbing a turbine ladder at this height would be DEATH

Which is why it’s so terrifying when

EXT VALLEY - DAY

Will runs with the ROPE SEGMENT It’s dangerous to move this
quickly and recklessly

EXT LAKE - DAY

Will jumps into the ROW-BOAT Unlike last time he is not
afraid anymore

Will pulls himself across the lake
He can almost see the TIMER ticking away on the WELL
How much time is left 20 minutes Or does it say 15

Will gets closer The dial on the timer coming into crisp
FOCUS

Oh no
TIMER 1 1 minute

He has to stop that timer

INT TURBINE - DAY

John hangs on for dear life One hand on the ladder the
other holding his BACKPACK Dangling in inky darkness

He regains his footing Takes a step
THE RUNG BUCKLES
JOHN FALLS TO PLATFORM ONE
LANDS ON HIS ARM THE BONE BREAKS WITH A DRY SNAP JOHN
WRITHES IN PAIN UNABLE TO MOVE
EXT LAKE - DAY
Will pulls himself across the lake as fast as he can
TIMER 1 5 seconds
His hands are bleeding
4 seconds
Face red
3 seconds
Tears in his eyes
2 seconds

Will braces himself

ALL THE QUIET THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN
ONE DEAFENING SHRIEK As THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE LAKE
CAPSIZING THE BOAT PLUNGING WILL INTO RED ALGAE

EXT HILLTOP - DAY
The quiet prairie

TIMER 2 DING 3tiiiiiiiii

INT TURBINE PLATFORM TWO - DAY
John climbs one handed His BROKEN ARM completely useless
He arrives at PLATFORM TWO Locks the gate Below we hear

TIMER 3 DING 3t1iiiiiiiii

John is rattled Everything is going wrong He looks down

A horrible silent moment passes and then

THE LARGE DARKENED FIGURE OF THE CREATURE CLIMBS INTO THE
TURBINE FUCK THAT WAS FAST

EXT WELL - DAY

Will surfaces He looks at the wet ROPE SEGMENT and tosses it
to the ground

INT TURBINE PLATFORM THREE - DAY

John arrives at the top of the turbine Closes and locks the
final gate

He listens in (gguameneEass

EXT TURBINE ROOF - DAY

John climbs outside into BLINDING SUNLIGHT He locks the ROOF
DOOR behind him

John’s eyes adjust to a dizzying 360 degree view of Midwest
landscape Rolling hills and high plains that go on forever

WE MAY OR MAY NOT NOTICE

horizon Its battered exterior encrusted with black welts
With DISHES that jut out like longwave receivers A shape
that could only be described as a crashed ALIEN DROPSHIP
John reaches into his backpack for his BRAIDED ROPE

Ties one end to the roof throws the other end down the
turbine and then --

John learns what we already knew

THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROPE TO REACH THE GROUND

The ALIEN’S bark reverberates through the tubular tower
Sounds of movement against the walls rush toward us
THE ROOF DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT

There’s a series of clanks and shuffling sounds BREATHING
Then POUNDING and CLAWING

THE ROOF DOOR BENDS OUTWARD IN THE SHAPE OF AN INHUMAN HAND
JOHN REPELS OFF THE SIDE OF THE TURBINE

ALL THE WAY DOWN

FALLING

FALLING

FALLING TOO FAST

FALLING WAY TOO FAST
JOHN SLOWS HIMSELF DOWN

THE ROPE BURNING THROUGH HIS HANDS AND SLEEVES BEFORE HE
COMES TO A FULL STOP HOLDING DANGLING

There’s about a fifty foot gap between the end of the rope
and the ground

John spots a LADDER on the other side of the base If he can
just swing over to it he can get down

WE HEAR THE ALIEN DESCENDING THE TOWER FROM INSIDE

John holds the rope with his good arm and runs alongside the
outer wall of the turbine

A few tries and he’s there Grabs the ladder with his broken
arm and climbs down in excruciating pain

John lands at the base of the turbine

HE THROWS THE FRONT DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKS IT FROM OUTSIDE

THE ALIEN IS TRAPPED INSIDE THE TURBINE

This is his chance THIS IS WHAT JOHN CAME HERE TO DO
JOHN

(at the top of his lungs)
APRIL APRIL CAN YOU HEAR ME

No response John yells LOUDER

JOHN
APRIL WHERE ARE YOU APRIL

THE LETHAL ARMS OF THE ALIEN SMASH THE TURBINE WALLS FROM

INSIDE THE STEEL BUBBLES AND BENDS AROUND THE BASE DOING
EVERYTHING IT CAN TO BREAK OUT OF THE TURBINE

John yells EVEN LOUDER

EXT TURBINE - DAY
THE ALIEN WRENCHES ITSELF FREE FROM THE TURBINE

and then it WAITS and LISTENS

EXT CREEK - DAY

The creek is too wide to cross over John and April race
along the bank on opposite sides

The creek starts to narrow bringing them
CLOSER CLOSER
CLOSER CLOSER
CLOSER CLOSER
CLOSER

John jumps over the narrow part of the creek and catches his
daughter The momentum carries him and April into a mountain
of crops
EXT CORN FIELD - DAY
Leaves and stalks slap them from all directions as they run
John slows down gains control of his breathing Hears the
WHEEZY PURR of the alien nearby Not sure what direction

Could be anywhere

April loses her dad for a moment through the dense corn She
gets tangled and falls Starts to panic

April turns as a SHADOW PASSES OVER HER
A HAND GRABS APRILS HAND

Will pulls April to her feet They run together Will never
lets go of her hand

John stumbles into a harvest tract He can see the top of the
farmhouse materializing through the crops

April and Will appear twenty feet away in the same tract
They’re searching for John

John tries to motion them over but -- THUD

A SCARECROW DROPS OUT OF THE SKY AND LANDS BETWEEN THEM - AS
IF THROWN BY THE ALIEN EVERYONE DUCKS FRIGHTENED AND
SILENT MUSIC SCORE RISES

THERE IS MOVEMENT ALL AROUND THEM

BUT WHERE IS IT COMING FROM

IT’S COMING
FROM BEHIND

MIA (VO)
April

A LINE FORMS IN THE CROPS THE KIND OF LINE MADE BY SOMETHING
TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARDS APRIL

APRIL STARES AT THE THROWN SCARECROW IT’S THE ONE SHE LEFT

The Doctor inspects April’s ears with an OTOSCOPE

MIA
How’s it feel

John opens his mouth as if to talk but he can’t find the
words

FLASHBACK EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

They leave the doctor’s office

John tries to place a comforting hand on April’s shoulder
She pushes his hand away
FLASHBACK INT FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS - DAY

April stands sadly in the hall studying playful letters
bedroom door which spell out “Iris”

A noise grabs her attention --

FLASHBACK INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

April moves through the house testing the volume on her
hearing aids

She is taken with all the SOUNDS around her THE HUM OF

ona

THE

AIR CONDITIONING THE REFRIGERATOR BUZZ THE CROWS OUTSIDE

APRIL RECOILS ASTRANGE HIGH-PITCH RINGING PULSATES IN HER

EAR LIKE AN IRRITATING PAINFUL WHISTLE

FLASHBACK EXT CORN FIELD - SUNSET
April follows the RINGING outside
Hundreds of CROWS flock away from the corn field

April sees her father placing a SIGNAL GENERATOR on one
the SCARECROWS

The high pitched sound is coming from the generator It
uncomfortably resonant in April’s ear

April approaches the SCARECROW and turns OFF the SIGNAL
GENERATOR

JOHN
What are you doing

APRIL
hurts my ears

John turns the generator back ON Walks away
April turns it OFF again defiant

JOHN
April what are you doing

APRIL
hurts my ears

JOHN
No it doesn’t Only animals can
hear this Go back inside

of

holds

John turns it back ON Walks away again

APRIL
I hate you

John stops

APRIL
I wish you died instead of her

BACK TO
STALKS BREAK AND BEND BEHIND THE CHILDREN
THE ALIEN KNOWS THEY’RE CLOSE
April crawls to the THROWN SCARECROW
Will looks at his sister like she’s crazy
April reaches into the body of the scarecrow and retrieves
THE SIGNAL GENERATOR
April and John lock eyes
John sees where she’s going with this
April is going to use the signal generator against the alien
John nods encouraging her

April sets the FREQUENCY DIAL on the signal generator to 500
GHz - its max setting

The alien steps out of the corn
April cranks the OUTPUT to 100
John gives April a thumbs up

They are finally working together They are finally starting
to communicate

April’s finger hovers over the ONOFF switch
She can feel the alien’s breath on the back of her neck
WITH THE FLICK OF A SWITCH APRIL TURNS THE GENERATOR ON

But nothing happens

John and April look on in horror

She hits the switch again Nothing

April flips the generator over and pulls out the BATTERIES
They are CORRODED John can’t believe it It’s all over

MIA (VO)
What are you thinking about

JOHN (VO)
Nothing

The alien hears April’s breathing change Her hands start to
tremble

MIA (VO)
Why won’t you talk to us anymore

JOHN (VO)
I don’t know

April goes white She stares helplessly at her father
MIA (VO)
You just disappear sometimes
(beat)
Into a quiet place

PUSH IN ON JOHN’S FACE AS WE REALIZE THE FLASHBACKS ARE HIS

MEMORIES THEY CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO AN OVERLAPPING
CACOPHONY OF VOICES AND IMAGES BARELY COHERENT AGGRESSIVELY
SENTIMENTAL FOCUSING ON THE THINGS WE STRUGGLE WITH ON THE
INSIDE ALL THE THINGS THAT GO LEFT UNSAID A MONTAGE OF THE
SUBCONSCIOUS THE UNSPOKEN THE QUIET PLACE OF OUR MINDS

APRIL (VO)
How come you and Daddy don’t talk

IRIS (VO)
I think I like it better when you
don’t say anything to me

MIA (VO)
You act like she doesn’t exist

APRIL (VO)
I hate you

JOHN (VO)
She knows I love her

MIA (VO)
She needs to hear you say it

JOHN (VO)
I need to tell you something

IRIS (VO)
What is it

Tears form in the corners of John’s eyes He knows what he
has to do John silently backs away Opens his mouth And
says with everything in his lungs

JOHN
I love you

And with that the alien turns its focus from the kids to
John This is John’s final sacrifice for his family

April and Will look up through tears They see the alien rip
across the tract toward their father

Just before the alien LUNGES Will turns the volume all the
way down on April’s hearing aid drowning out John’s CRIES as

QUR WORLD GOES SILENT

EXT CORN FIELD CLEARING - DAY

SLOW MOTION April and Will escape into the corn

EXT CORN FIELD WEATHER VANE - DAY

SLOW MOTION April and Will pass the WEATHER VANE They
follow it to the FARMHOUSE Bb pb

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

SLOW MOTION April and Will run to the shed The alien close
behind BLOOD on its face

INT SHED - DAY

SLOW MOTION April runs to the back of the shed

She removes two BATTERIES from the MP3 PLAYER
and slaps them into the SIGNAL GENERATOR

April stands outside in front of the shed
The alien somehow inches away

April lets out a stunned cry

Falls back

Closes her eyes

Activates the SIGNAL GENERATOR
WE HEAR NOTHING OVER THE HIGH PITCHED RING OF THE GENERATOR
which seems to take on a music-like quality heavy dissonance
climbing to an unexpected harmonic crescendo

April looks up terrified at what she’ll see

SHE SEES --

THE ALIEN FROZEN IN A SEIZURE

SHIVERING ALMOST FROM THE INSIDE

A TINY VIBRATION MOVING THROUGH ITS COMPLEXION

LIKE A SONIC TUMOR GROWING EXPANDING EATING

AWAY ALL THE VITAL PARTS THAT MAKE IT HEAR

THINK MOVE KILL

THE ALIEN COWERS

CONTORTS
COLLAPSES DEAD JUST AS --

SOUND BEGINS TO FADE BACK IN ALL AROUND US
AND TIME SEEMS TO SPEED UP TO NORMAL
April turns to close the SHED DOORS

But Mia stops her She pushes the doors WIDE OPEN

They don’t have to be afraid anymore

The family embraces Melting into a flurry of emotions that
have gone unexpressed for far too long

SLOW FADE TO

EXT CEMETERY - SUNSET

Autumn leaves blow over a recently harvested field They
swirl through the crisp air and fall on a pair of HEADSTONES

April stands in a SUNDAY DRESS Her hair braided behind her
head The SIGNAL GENERATOR hangs around her neck

She places a PURPLE IRIS on a grave marked JOHN WALKER

Mia and Will stand behind her with a STROLLER A ONE YEAR OLD
plays nearby

Mia looks at April she smiles brushes her daughter’s hair
behind one ear

WE HEAR THE LAUGHTER OF BABY IRIS FILL THE AIR

THE END
