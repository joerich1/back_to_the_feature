FADE IN
1 EXT STERNWOOD PLACE - ESTABLISHING SCENE

It is a millionaires house big sprawling California
style with clipped lawns and gardens on a hill above the
now abandoned oil field which was the familys wealth A
small coupe drives up to the door and stops and Philip
Marlowe gets out We just have time to establish him as he
approaches the door -- a husky self-confident man well-
dressed but not flashy

with a gentle intelligent face

as Norris shuts the door takes Marlowes hat

NORRIS

the General you have come

MARLOWE
Okay

Norris exits Marlowe looks about interested and curious
sees something moves toward it

CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE

as he stands before a portrait examining it with curious
interest It is a portrait of General Sternwood in
regimentals beneath crossed battle-torn cavalry pennons
and a sabre He is still staring at the portrait when at a
SOUND OFF he turns and sees CARMEN STERNWOOD approaching
She is about 20 in slacks something sullen and hot about
her She stops about 10 feet from him and stares at him
biting the thumb of her left hand

MARLOWE
Good morning

CARMEN
(after a moment)
Youre not very tall are you

MARLOWE
I tried to be

CARMEN
Not bad looking though -- you
probably know it

MARLOWE
Thanks

He goes to a chair and sits down When he looks up he
sees Carmen approaching still staring at him

CARMEN
(approaching)
Whats your name

MARLOWE
Reilly -- Doghouse Reilly

CARMEN
(beside the chair now)
Thats a funny name Are you a prize

fighter

MARLOWE
No Ima shamus

CARMEN
A what

MARLOWE

A private detective
CARMEN
Youre cute

As she speaks she sits suddenly on the arm of his chair
As she does so Marlowe rises shifts the chair in doing
so so that to her surprise Carmen finds herself sitting
in the chair itself She stares up surprised and then
angrily is about to speak again when they both see Norris
He has just entered noiselessly stands beside the chair
On Norris face there is now a curious expression of grief
sadness Carmen glances up at him rises quickly as if he
had reprimanded her with words and exits Marlowe looks
after her thoughtful a little grim

NORRIS
The General will see you now

MARLOWE
(looking after Carmen)
Who was that

NORRIS
Miss Carmen Sternwood sir
MARLOWE
You ought to wean her She looks
old enough
NORRIS

Yes sir This way if you please
They exit through French doors
EXT REAR LAWN - SAME WEALTHY SCALE

Garage at one side beyond it a tremendous greenhouse
Norris is leading Marlowe along the path toward the green
house A chauffeur is washing a car before the garage We
establish him in passing -- a handsome boyish-looking man
OWEN TAYLOR

Marlowe follows Norris on to the greenhouse looking at the
tremendous size of it as Norris opens the door and stands
aside for Marlowe to enter

INT GREENHOUSE CHOKED WITH ORCHID PLANTS

Marlowe following Norris between the crowding tendrils and
branches The place is oven-hot damp with sweat green
with gloom Marlowe is already reacting to it is already
mopping his face with his handkerchief
MARLOWE
(mopping neck
following Norris)
Couldnt we have gone around this

NORRIS
(over shoulder
walking on)
The General sits in here sir

MED CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL STERNWOOD

in a wheelchair in center of the greenhouse in a cleared
space about which the plants crowd and hover The GENERAL
is the man we saw in the portrait though older and
obviously dying so that only his fierce eyes seem to have
any life Even in the terrific heat his body is wrapped in
a traveling rug and a heavy bathrobe his gnarled hands
lying like dead gnarled twigs on the rug his fierce eyes
following as Norris leads Marlowe in

NORRIS

(stopping)
This is Mr Marlowe General

The General does not speak only the fierce eyes stare at
Marlowe as Norris pushes a wicker chair up behind Marlowes
legs

STERNWOOD
Brandy Norris
(to Marlowe)
How do you like your brandy sir

MARLOWE
(sitting down)
Just with brandy

Norris takes Marlowes hat exits

STERNWOOD
I used to like mine with champagne
The champagne cold as Valley Forge
and about three ponies of brandy
under it You may take your coat
off sir

MARLOWE
Thanks

He rises removes his coat takes out his handkerchief
hangs his coat on chair
STERNWOOD
(watching him)
Its too hot in here for any man
who still has blood in his veins

Marlowe sits again mops his face and neck

STERNWOOD
(still watching him)
You may smoke too I can still
enjoy the smell of it anyway

MARLOWE
Thanks

He produces a cigarette lights it blows smoke Sternwoods
nostrils moving as he sniffs the smoke Norris enters
pushing a teawagon bearing decanter siphon initialed
ice-bucket

STERNWOOD
That man is already dead who must
indulge his own vices by proxy

Norris wheels the wagon up starts to prepare a drink

STERNWOOD
(watching pettishly)
Come man Pour a decent one

NORRIS
(adding brandy)
Yes General

MARLOWE
(watching)
But not too decent Norris I dont
want to exchange places with it

Norris adds soda hands glass to Marlowe

MARLOWE
(taking glass)
Thanks

He sits back Norris covers the ice-bucket with a napkin
exits SOUND of DOOR CLOSING as Norris leaves the
greenhouse Marlowe raises the glass sips Sternwood
watches him licks his lips with longing pleasure and
enjoyment Marlowe lowers the glass

STERNWOOD
Tell me about yourself Mr Marlowe
I suppose I have the right to ask
MARLOWE
Theres not much to tell Im
thirty-eight years old went to
college once I can still speak
English when theres any demand for
it in my business I worked for the
District Attorneys office once It
was Bernie Ohls his chief
investigator who sent me word you
wanted to see me Im not married

STERNWOOD
You didnt like working for Mr
Wilde

MARLOWE
I was fired for insubordination
I seem to rate pretty high on that

STERNWOOD
I always did myself Sir --
(he slides one
hand under the
rug on his knees)
What do you know about my family
Mr Marlowe

MARLOWE

(mopping)
Youre a widower a millionaire two
young daughters One unmarried the
other married once but it didnt
didnt take Both now living with
you and both --

(he breaks off

the Generals

fierce eyes

watch him)

STERNWOOD
Go on

MARLOWE
Am I to swap you gossip for
hospitality

STERNWOOD
(sternly)
You are to swap me your confidence
for my own
MARLOWE
(shrugs)
All right Both pretty and both
pretty -- wild What did you want
to see me about

STERNWOOD
Im being blackmailed again

MARLOWE

(mopping)
Again

STERNWOOD

(draws his hand

out from under

the rug holding

a brown envelope)
About a year ago I paid a man named
Joe Brody five thousand dollars
to let my younger daughter alone

MARLOWE
Ah
STERNWOOD
What does that mean
MARLOWE
It means ah It never went

through the DAs office or Id
have known it Who handled that for
you

STERNWOOD
Shawn Regan did

MARLOWE

(alternating between

the drink the

cigarette and

the now sodden

handkerchief with

which he mops his

face and neck)
There must be some reason why Regans
not handling this one too Am I to
know it

STERNWOOD
Shawn has left me
MARLOWE
I thought I hadnt seen him around
lately

STERNWOOD
Yes he left about a month ago
without a word That was what hurt
I had no claim on him since I was
only his employer But I hoped we
were more than that and that he
would have said goodbye to me You
knew him too

MARLOWE
Yes From the old days when he
was running rum from Mexico and
I was on the other side and now
and then we swapped shots between
drinks -- or drinks between shots
if you like that better

STERNWOOD
My respects to you Few men ever
exchange more than one shot with
Shawn Regan He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army you
know

MARLOWE
(mopping)
No I didnt But I knew he was
a good man at whatever he did
Nobody was pleased better than me
when I heard you had taken him on
as your -- whatever he was here

STERNWOOD

As my friend my son almost
Manys the hour he would sit here
with me sweating like a pig
drinking the brandy I could no
longer drink telling me stories
of the Irish revolution -- But
enough of this

(he holds out

the envelope)
Here And help yourself to the
brandy

Marlowe takes the envelope sits again wipes his hands on
his wet handkerchief removes from the envelope a card and
three clips of stiff paper

Sternwood watching from wheelchair as Marlowe mixes himself
a drink at the wagon then turns toward chair

STERNWOOD
(watching Marlowe)
Well

MARLOWE
(standing)
Whos Arthur Gwynne Geiger

STERNWOOD
I havent the faintest idea

MARLOWE
Have you asked your daughter

STERNWOOD
I dont intend to If I did she
would suck her thumb and look coy

MARLOWE
Yeah I met her in the hall She
did that at me Then she tried to
sit in my lap

Sternwood stares at him After a moment Marlowe raises the
glass drinks lowers it

STERNWOOD
(harshly)
Well

MARLOWE
(stares at him a moment)
Am I being polite or can I say
what I want

STERNWOOD
Say it

MARLOWE
Do the two girls run around together

STERNWOOD

I think not They are alike only in
their one corrupt blood Vivian is
spoiled exacting smart ruthless
Carmen is still the child who likes
to pull the wings off flies I
assume they have always had all the
usual vices whatever new ones of
their own invention --

(again he makes

the repressed

convulsive

movement glares

at Marlowe)
Well

MARLOWE
Pay him

STERNWOOD
Why

MARLOWE

Its cheaper A little money
against a lot of annoyance The
money you wont miss and if your
heart hasnt broken long before this
time whatevers behind these --

(indicates the notes

on the chair)
-- cant do it now

STERNWOOD
Not my heart No Sternwood ever had
one But there is my pride which I
at least and I believe my older
daughter still both have

MARLOWE
Sure A man named AG Geigers
just betting himself three thousand
bucks on that pride Who was this
Joe Brody you paid the five thousand
to

STERNWOOD
I dont recall Norris would know
My butler I think he called himself
a gambler
(hopefully)
This may be an authentic gambling
debt after all

Marlowe looks at Sternwood for a moment Then he half
turns sets the glass on the wagon and takes the napkin
from around the ice bucket and mops himself with it
Sternwood watches him

MARLOWE
Do you think it is

STERNWOOD
(after a second)
No

Marlowe mops himself again with the napkin puts it back on
the wagon takes up his glass drinks

MARLOWE
I guess you want me to take this
Geiger off your back that right

STERNWOOD
Yes

MARLOWE
Do you want to know anything or do
you just want to be rid of him

STERNWOOD
Didnt you just tell me I no longer
have any heart to be broken

MARLOWE
It may cost you a little -- besides
my own twenty-five a day and expenses

Sternwood says nothing merely makes a faint impatient
movement of his head or shoulders Marlowe drains the
glass sets it back on the wagon

MARLOWE
When do I start
STERNWOOD
At once And now if you will excuse
me -- But another brandy before
you go
MARLOWE

(takes up papers
from chair then
his coat)

No thanks

STERNWOOD
(presses bell plugged
into chair arm)
Then good morning And good luck

He lies back in the chair closes his eyes Marlowe
watches him a moment then his coat over his arm and still
mopping his neck he turns and exits

EXT GREENHOUSE - MARLOWE

emerges still carrying his coat dripping wet mopping
with his sodden handkerchief breathing the cool air
starts away Before he reaches the house Norris meets

grave

NORRIS
Mrs Rutledge the older daughter
would like to see you before you
leave sir And about the money
the General has instructed me to
give you a check for whatever you
require

MARLOWE

Instructed you how

NORRIS
(blinks stares
then smiles)

Ah I see sir I forgot you are a
detective By the way he rang the
bell

MARLOWE

You write his checks

NORRIS

I have that privilege

MARLOWE
(starts on)

That ought to save you from a paupers
grave I wont need any money now
thanks -- How did Mrs Rutledge know

I was here

NORRIS

She saw you through the window I
was obliged to tell her who you were

MARLOWE

I dont like that

NORRIS

large over-elaborate feminine VIVIAN
a chaise-lounge showing her legs to good
She is beautiful giving an impression of
and strong emotions the dangerous

unpredictable type

She sips a drink insolently at ease watching Marlowe as
he enters Marlowe is still rumpled and sweating He
adopts her be-damned-to-you attitude looks her over and
sits down unbidden wiping his face and neck with his
handkerchief

VIVIAN
So youre a private detective
I didnt know they existed except
in books or else they were little
greedy men snooping around hotels
My youre a mess arent you

MARLOWE
Yeah -- Im not the orchid-bearing
type

VIVIAN
This business of Dads -- think you

can handle it for him

MARLOWE
(sardonically)
It doesnt look too tough

VIVIAN
Really I would have thought a
case like that took a little effort

MARLOWE
Not too much

VIVIAN
Well What will your first step be

MARLOWE
The usual one

VIVIAN
I didnt know there was a usual one

MARLOWE
Oh yes It comes complete with
diagrams on Page forty-seven of How
to be a Detective in Ten Easy Lessons
correspondence school textbook

VIVIAN
You must have read another one on
how to be a comedian Im quite
serious Mr Marlowe My father
is not well and I want this case
handled with the least possible
worry to him
MARLOWE
Thats the way Im going to handle
it

VIVIAN

I see No professional secrets

Marlowe doesnt answer Hes still admiring her legs
Vivian sets her glass down looking him over coolly as
though he were something in a bottle

VIVIAN
How do you like Dad

MARLOWE
I liked him

VIVIAN

He liked Shawn I suppose you know
who Shawn is

MARLOWE
Yeah I know

VIVIAN
You dont have to play poker with me
Dad wants to find him doesnt he

MARLOWE
Do you

VIVIAN
Of course I do It wasnt right
for him to go off like that Broke
Dads heart although he wont say
much about it Or did he

MARLOWE
He mentioned it

VIVIAN
I dont see what there is to be cagey
about And I dont like your manners

MARLOWE
Im not crazy about yours I didnt
ask to see you And I dont mind
your ritzing me or drinking your
lunch out of a bottle I dont mind
your showing me your legs Theyre
very swell legs and its a pleasure
to make their acquaintance I dont
mind if you dont like my manners

(MORE )
MARLOWE (CONTD)
Theyre pretty bad I grieve over
them during the long winter evenings
But dont waste your time trying to
cross-examine me

Vivian is really angry now She swings her legs to the
floor and her anger is something sparkling and terrific

VIVIAN
People dont talk like that to me

Marlowe laughs at her softly His eyes are warm and
mocking Vivian relaxes slowly looking at him and
something besides fury comes into her own face

VIVIAN
Do you always think you can handle
people like trained seals

MARLOWE
Just what is it youre afraid of

They watch each other and Vivians face closes against
him like a door

VIVIAN
Dad didnt want to see you about
Shawn at all

MARLOWE
Didnt he

VIVIAN
Get out
(as Marlowe rises
and turns from her)
Please you could find Shawn if
Dad wanted you to

MARLOWE
(still dead pan)
When did he go

VIVIAN
A month back He just drove away
one afternoon without saying a word
They found his car in some private
garage

MARLOWE
They

VIVIAN
(her manner suddenly
different as though
she has won her bout
with him)
Dad didnt tell you then

MARLOWE
He told me about Regan yes Thats
not what he wanted to see me about
Is that what youve been trying to
get me to say

VIVIAN
Im sure I dont care what you say

MARLOWE
(giving her a look
she could chin
herself on)
You might change your mind about
that some day So long Mrs
Rutledge

Vivian watches him as he goes out with smoldering
puzzled eyes

INT MAIN BALL

Marlowe comes down the hall heading for the door Norris
appears with Marlowes hat and hands it to him

MARLOWE
You made a mistake Mrs Rutledge
didnt want to see me

NORRIS
Im sorry sir I make many
mistakes

He opens the door Marlowe pauses to look at the view
LONG SHOT - MARLOWES ANGLE

Beyond the lawns and hedges of the Sternwood estate the
ground falls away to barren fields with several old wooden
derricks some of them still wearily pumping oil The
derricks are at a considerable distance from the house but
a man with binoculars could see any activity around them
clearly enough The sky is clouded THUNDER SOUNDS
distantly

AT THE STERNWOOD DOOR

MARLOWE
How long those wells been pumping

NORRIS
About thirty years The General
likes to take his field glasses
sometimes and sit by the window
and watch the walking-beams Theyre
like life he says -- an endless
seesaw forever up and down and
getting nowhere

MARLOWE
They get oil Black stuff with
a smell to it worth dollars

He goes out gets into his car and drives away The SOUND

AGNES a hard-looking expensive blonde in a tight black
dress rises from behind the desk as Marlowe approaches
and moves to greet him Her manner is professionally
distant her accent betrays her phony veneer

AGNES
Can I be of any assistance

Would you happen to have a Ben

(with a frozen smile)
Uh -- not at the moment

MARLOWE
(politely)
You do sell books

AGNES
(dropping the act
pointing to the
display books)
What do those look like --
grapefruit

MARLOWE
They look like books from here
anyway Maybe Id better talk
to Mr Geiger

AGNES
Hes not in at the moment

Marlowe glances up as a man enters the store a middle-
aged important-looking person who has an incongruously
furtive and nervous manner He looks quickly at Marlowe
then at Agnes who gives him an almost imperceptible
warning nod Marlowe remains blandly unaware of the
byplay all his attention apparently on the cigarette hes
lighting

The man walks quickly to the rear of the store Agnes
pushes a button on the desk A door in the back wall opens
on a buzzer lock The man darts through it like a rabbit

AGNES
(to Marlowe)
I said Mr Geiger is not in

MARLOWE
I heard you Ill wait for him

AGNES
He wont be back until very late

At this point the furtive man comes out of the rear part of
the store and leaves hurriedly looking at neither Agnes
nor Marlowe His face is lined and haggard Marlowe is
interested

MARLOWE

(watching the man out)
He must have got hold of the wrong
title

(to Agnes)
Well guess Id better blow Im
already late now for my lecture on
Argentine cera-micks

(mispronouncing the word)

AGNES
(icily correcting him)
The word is cerAMics And they aint
Argentine theyre Egyptian

MARLOWE
You did sell a book once didnt
you Well even the Argentines
a little too far for me today
Guess Ill just stick to the public
library -- or I might try that
book store across the street

AGNES

Do so

Agnes stares viciously at his back until he is out Then
she goes to the door at the rear knocks and goes through

MOVING SHOT - MARLOWE

He walks across the boulevard turns into a small
bookstore the second-hand variety cluttered and dingy
Several nondescript people browse among the tables At the
rear a small dark shrewd-faced woman sits reading at a
desk -- apparently she is the proprietor Marlowe
approaches her and she looks up blank-faced from her book

shoots out of Geigers house like s flash of lightning

Marlowe rounds the hedge on the run There is a wooden
footbridge bridging the gap between the bank and the front
door He covers this in two jumps and stops at the front
door The knocker is in the shape of a lions head and
ring in its mouth Marlowe puts his hand on it and as he
does three SHOTS SOUND from inside

Marlowe freezes From inside we HEAR a sighing groan and

Chinese embroidery and Oriental prints on them Low
bookshelves a desk thick rug floor cushions low divans
-- an exotic messy atmosphere

On a low dais at one end of the room is a carved teakwood
chair a massive thing in which Carmen Sternwood sits
rigidly erect in the pose of an Egyptian goddess

She wears a mans large silk dressing gown -- it doesnt
pretend to fit her and gives the impression of having been
thrown hurriedly around her by someone other than herself
Carmens eyes have a queer fixed stare She pays no
attention to Marlowe She looks as if in her mind she is
doing something very important and doing it well She
seems pleased about it her lips curved to a smile She
laughs from time to time -- softly secretly

Opposite her Geiger lies on the floor in front of a thing
like a totem pole The eye of the totem is a camera lens
it focuses on the chair where Carmen sits A blackened
flash bulb is clipped to the totem beside it Geiger is
dressed in semi-oriental fashion His embroidered coat is
soaked with blood He is obviously dead

Marlowe takes all this in sniffs the air It is heavy
with something unpleasant He crosses to a small lacquer
table bearing a flagon of dark liquid and two glasses
Marlowe sniffs the flagon makes a grimace of disgust
Carmens clothes are wadded up on the divan Marlowe picks
up her coat and shoes and goes to her

MARLOWE
Hello Remember me

She doesnt seem to see him The soft secret laughter is
his only answer He goes closer and deliberately slaps
her face This gets a reaction -- he slaps her again
without emotion but hard Carmen comes to slightly
giving him a sly mad smile

MARLOWE
Youre higher than a kite Come on
lets be nice Lets get dressed
Carmen

He puts her shoes on

CARMEN
(giggling)
You tickle
MARLOWE

Yeah you tickle me too

Marlowe pulls her to her feet and puts her coat on trying
not to dislodge the dressing gown She falls against him
very happy about it all apparently about to pass out
Marlowe is not happy

MARLOWE
Lets take a walk

CARMEN
(thickly half conscious)
Youre cute

MARLOWE
Sure sure Sos your boyfriend
Want to look at him

He walks the staggering girl over to Geigers body It is
hard work -- and Carmen is not impressed

CARMEN
(as before)
Hes cute

MARLOWE
Cute Yeah Lets walk

He walks her back and forth across the room a couple of

times -- LOW CAMERA FEATURING the dead man as their legs
pass in front of him Then she passes out in his arms

still convinced that everything is cute He spreads her
out on the divan unconsciously wiping his hands on his

coat as though he has touched something dirty

Then he returns to the totem and Geigers body He
examines the concealed camera The plateholder is gone
He rolls Geigers body over enough to see under it No
plateholder He frowns thoughtfully at the girl then
goes into the rear of the house

INT GEIGERS HOUSE - REAR ROOMS - NIGHT

Marlowe passes quickly through the bath and kitchen
pausing to try the locked kitchen door and to examine a
window which had been jimmied open The scars show plainly
on the wood the rain blowing in unheeded Marlowe then
goes to the bedroom which is in keeping with the living
room He glances briefly through the closet with a mans
clothes in it then picks up a keyholder from the dressing
table where it has been placed along with other contents
of Geigers pockets -- money handkerchief etc

INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marlowe returns and unlocks the desk In one drawer he

finds a locked steel box which he opens with Geigers
keys He takes from it a leather book

INSERT THE BOOK IN MARLOWES HANDS

He leafs through the pages slowly showing an index and
writing in code in the same slanted printing as on the
cards General Sternwood gave him

INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marlowe places the book in his pocket wipes his
fingerprints carefully from the box replaces it end locks
the desk He pockets the keys turns off the lamps and the
gas logs in the fireplace makes a wadded bundle of
Carmens clothes jams her hat on her head and picks her
up holding her clothes awkwardly in one hand On the way
out he pushes down the light switch by the door and kicks
the door shut behind him

EXT GEIGERS HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)

DISSOLVE TO

EXT STERNWOOD HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)

Marlowe has just rung the doorbell In the drive behind
him stands Carmens Packard The door opens

Norris appears in it recognizes Marlowe looks swiftly
past him and recognizes the car also Then he looks at
Marlowe again -- the same quiet grave face with its
expression of grief and sadness which the sight of the car
brought into it His voice though is quiet and calm

NORRIS

MARLOWE

waiting car and return his face still grave only the
grief a little sharper behind it

NORRIS
(quickly)

MARLOWE

NORRIS

He stands with his hand still on the light switch looks
about the room crosses to another tamp puts it on is
about to turn away when he stops dead reacts as he looks
at the totem pole and at the floor beneath it where
Geigers body had lain

The body is gone Marlowe crosses the room wasting no
time determined He passes through door to bedroom snaps
light on beyond it after a moment the light beyond the
door snaps off and Marlowe re-enters living room He has
not found the body He stands for a moment thinking then
he goes and kneels so that he can squint along the surface
of the thick rug He sees in the nap the marks where
Geigers heels were dragged along it across the room
toward the front door He rises at last thoughtful
slowly takes out a cigarette and lights it drops match
into ashtray stops takes up the dead match and puts it
into his pocket

Then he takes out his handkerchief goes and wipes off the
bedroom doorknob goes to the first lamp turns it out and
wipes it off leaving room in darkness and himself a shadow

All right all right Keep your

INT MARLOWES LIVING ROOM - AT FRONT DOOR

as Marlowe opens it to admit BERNIE OHLS a dapper
slightly flashy man whose clothes are expensive and always
a little wrong His face is dapper and deceiving since it
is actually the face of a man who has been in close places
in the course of his duty has killed several lawbreakers
at times when he was outnumbered and they thought he was
covered and helpless until too late He is pleasant and
affable to all respects courage loves no man

Marlowe glances up sharply as Carol Lundgren

the dark

handsome boy in the leather jacket opens the door in the
rear wall Behind him through the open door we see the
back room littered with the papers and boxes of hurried
packing and a gaunt hard-looking man with a certain

animal attractiveness in the midst of it cramming folios
and stacks of large-sized envelopes into the packing boxes

Carol is obviously strained and under tension
though he has not slept

CAROL

He becomes aware of Marlowe shuts up abruptly and slams
the door From the partition his voice rises sharp but
unintelligible answered by a heavier mans voice -- no
words come through but the implication is clearly that
Carol shall shut up and get out A door slams violently
then there is silence Marlowe ignoring this byplay and
the stricken look on Agnes face puts on his glasses and
touches his hat

hint of seriousness)

How did you get into this slimy
business then

MARLOWE
(giving her a look
as he lights it

Because people like you pay good
money to have the slime cleaned up

She looks away from him angry hut not able to say
anything Marlowe sits down behind the desk

MARLOWE
What did you want to see me about
Taylor

VIVIAN
(softly)
Poor Owen So you know about that

MARLOWE
A DAs man took me down to Lido
Turned out he knew more about it
than I did He knew Owen Taylor
wanted to marry your sister -- once

VIVIAN

(quietly)
Perhaps it wouldnt have been a bad
idea He was in love with her We
dont find much of that in our
circle

(changing her tone)
But I didnt come to see you about
Owen Do you feel yet that you can
tell me what my father wants you to
do

MARLOWE
Not without his permission

VIVIAN
Was it about Carmen

MARLOWE
I cant even say that

Vivian watches him for a moment then gives in She takes
a thick white envelope from her bag and tosses it on the
desk

VIVIAN
Youd better look at this anyway

Marlowe examines the envelope

VIVIAN
A messenger brought it this morning
MARLOWE
Eight-thirty-five it says -- for

you or your father

He opens the envelope takes out a medium-sized photograph
We do not see the subject of the picture but Marlowes
reaction is significant He whistles softly

MARLOWE
So thats what Carmen looks like
(to Vivian)
How much do they want for this

VIVIAN
Five thousand -- for the negative and
the rest of the prints The deal has
to be closed tonight or they give
the picture to some scandal sheet

this thing was delivered

MARLOWE
Theres nothing in the scandal sheet
angle Juries convict on that racket
without leaving the box What else
is there

VIVIAN
Does there have to be something else
Marlowe nods -- his face is uncompromising

jam connected with it and Id
better lay it on the line fast or
Id be talking to my little sister
through a wire screen

hurry

police might turn up something

where would the Sternwoods be

How was it left

MARLOWE

Okay -- call me here as soon as

VIVIAN

I believe in people believing theyre
smarter than they are -- if thats

a miracle

Have a drink

He reaches down into the desk drawer

VIVIAN

Ill have two drinks

Marlowe grins at her

glasses fills them

He comes up with a bottle and two
and takes one to her They salute

start to drink and find that their eyes have met over the
glass rims and refuse to come apart Vivian breaks it not
because she is shy or coy but because suddenly there is a

sadness in her face

Her gaze drops briefly then returns

to Marlowe clear steady and sad

VIVIAN
Youre a lot like Shawn Regan

Marlowe looks at her almost with tenderness and
understanding

MARLOWE
You want to tell me now or later

VIVIAN

hand for the envelope Marlowe gives it to her but
doesnt let go of it

CARMEN
Photograph What photograph
She turns

MARLOWE
(drags at cigarette
expels smoke)
Just like last night What a scream
we are Sternwood and Reilly two
stooges in search of a comedian

CARMEN
Your name isnt Reilly Its Marlowe
Vivian told me

MARLOWE

So you are beginning to remember
And you came back to look for the
photograph but you couldnt get
into the house

(she stares at him)
The photos gone I looked for it
last night Brody took it with him

CARMEN
Ive got to go home now

MARLOWE
Sure But I wouldnt tell the
police about Brody yet Dont even
tell a soul you were ever here --
either last night or today Net
even Vivian Leave it to Doghouse
Reilly Wheres your car

CARMEN
On the back street where nobody
would see it

to go out as he turns to follow

MARLOWE
Youre not going to tell anybody
we were here are you

CARMEN
(gives him a swooning look)
It depends I never tell on people
who are nice to me

She gives him a languishing swooning

inviting look so

that her attitude is a caricature of what her more

brilliant and vivid sisters might be

Marlowe grasps her

arm almost savagely turns her toward the door

MARLOWE
Come on Get out of here --

He stops they both react as FEET SOUND beyond the doer
approaching they pause dead as the BELL RINGS While they
stand staring at each other Carmen drooling almost with
terror the BELL RINGS AGAIN ceases then SOUND of KEY at
the lock and a moment later the door opens and EDDIE MARS
enters quickly and then stops dead staring at them He is
a handsome hard horsy-looking man in beautiful
restrained expensive clothes who stands staring at them
with complete composure for a moment Then he looks at
Carmen shuts the door takes his hat off

MARS
Excuse the casual entrance The bell
didnt answer Is Mr Geiger around
MARLOWE

No We dont knew just where he is
We found the doer open and stepped in

MARS
I see Friends of his
MARLOWE
Just business We dropped in for

a book

Mars stares hard at Marlowe who stares just as hard
back

MARLOWE
But we missed him
(takes Carmens arm
pushes her toward
door to pass Mars)
So well trot along

As Marlowe is about to shoulder Mars aside to pass Mars
himself steps aside until Carmen has passed him then he
moves in between Marlowe and the door

MARS
The girl can go But Id like
to talk to you a little

Marlowe stares at him then makes a slight motion toward
the gun inside his coat

MARS
Dont try it Ive got two boys
outside in the car

He turns opens the door Carmen scuttles through it Mars
shuts the door behind her looks about the room

MARS
(puts hat back on)
Theres something wrong around here
I intend to find out what it is If
you want to pick lead out of yourself
go ahead

MARLOWE
A tough guy

Mars makes no answer He walks on into the room looking
around Marlowe watches him

MARLOWE
I suppose its all right if I
smoke

Mars does not answer He looks about sees the totem pole
is astonished approaches it stops suddenly as he moves
the small rug over the bloodstain with his foot then
kneels swiftly out of sight for an instant beyond the desk
When he rises he is facing Marlowe and his hand is just
emerging from inside his coat holding a Luger pistol

MARS
Blood On the floor there under
the rug Quite a lot of blood

MARLOWE
(in interested tone)
Is that so

Mars slides into the chair behind the desk still watching
Marlowe hooks the telephone toward him with the pistol-
barrel then shifts the pistol to his left hand and puts
his right hand on the phone but without raising it

MARS
I think well have some law

Marlowe approaches while Mars watches him and looks down
at the stain pretends to have seen it for the first time

MARLOWE
Thats old blood Dried
MARS
Just the same well have some law
MARLOWE
Why not
MARS

Just who are you anyway
MARLOWE
Marlowes the name Im a private
detective

MARS

Whos the girl

MARLOWE
A client Geiger was trying to
throw a loop on her We came to
talk it over He wasnt here

MARS
Convenient -- the door being
open when you didnt have a key

MARLOWE
Wasnt it By the way howd you
happen to have one

MARS
Is that any of your business

MARLOWE
I could make it my business

MARS
(smiles tightly)
And I could make your business mine

MARLOWE
You wouldnt like it The pays
too small

MARS
I own this house Geiger is my
tenant Now what do you think
of it

MARLOWE
You know some nice people

MARS

I take them as they come
(he glances down
at the pistol
shrugs puts
it back inside
coat)

Got any ideas detective

MARLOWE

One or two Somebody gunned Geiger
Somebody got gunned by Geiger who
ran away Or Geiger was running a
cult and made blood sacrifices in
front of that barber pole there Or
he had meat for dinner and does his
butchering in the front parlor

(Mars scowls at him)
All right Ill give up then Call
your friends downtown

MARS
I dont get it I still dont
get your game here

MARLOWE
Dont you Mr Mars

Mars stares et Marlowe who meets his stare steadily
Mars face is now hard

MARS
You seem to be telling me Geiger
was in a racket of some sort
What racket

MARLOWE
I dont know Im not his landlord
And Ill tell you something else you
missed Somebody cleaned out
whatever was in that back room in
his bookshop today

Mars stares at Marlowe a long moment Marlowe takes out
a cigarette deliberately is starting to light it

MARS
You talk too much

While Marlowe stands the cigarette in his mouth the
matchbox resting in his hands Mars suddenly whips out the
pistol again holds it on Marlowe and whistles shrilly
SOUND of car door SLAMMING OFF then RUNNING FEET

MARS
Open the door

MARLOWE
Open it yourself Ive already got
a client

Mars rises still holding the pistol on Marlowe crosses
toward the door as the SOUND OF FEET reaches the door and
the knob is rattled from outside Mars reaches the door
opens it Two men plunge into the room already reaching
inside their coats One is a young hoodlum good-looking
pale-faced boy the other is older slim deadpan

MARS
(jerks his head
at Marlowe)
Look him over

The slim man flicks out a short pistol covers Marlowe
The boy approaches searches Marlowe who turns helping
the boy search him with the burlesqued air of a bored
beauty modeling a gown in a shop

BOY
Okay No iron

MARS
Find who he is

The boy draws Marlowes wallet from his breast pocket
flips it open studies the contents

BOY
A shamus

He strikes Marlowe moving faster catches his wrist
wrenches it suddenly and sharply so that in the next
instant the wallet is in Marlowes hand The boy reacts
angrily but Mars stops it

MARS
(sharply)
Thatll do Beat it
The boy stops sullenly glaring at Marlowe
MARS
(coldly vicious)
I said outside

The two guards withdraw exit

MARS
All right Talk

Marlowe deliberately finishes lighting the cigarette
inhales
MARLOWE
Not to you I told you Ive already
got a client

MARS
Who was it cleaned out the back of
Geigers store

MARLOWE
Quite a shower yesterday Did it
rain up there at Las Olindas

MARS
(slaps the pistol
angrily down on
the desk)
I might even make it worth your
while to talk to me

MARLOWE
Thats the spirit Leave the gun
out of it I can always hear money
How much of it are you clinking at
me

MARS

(slams the desk

again with the

flat pistol)

I ask you a question and you ask

me another My guess is you need
some help yourself So cough up

MARLOWE
Not me Its Geigers kinfolk that
need help -- provided a man like

Geiger had anybody who loved him and
will care who bumped him off So
Id better give what I know to the
Law Which puts it in the public
domain and dont leave me anything
to sell So I guess Ill drift

Marlowe makes a move to lift the gun but does not

MARLOWE
(easily)
By the way hows Mrs Mars these
days

Mars hand jerks at the gun almost lifts it pauses
glares at Marlowe

MARS
(almost whispers
raging inside)
Beat it Get out of here

Marlowe moves easily and unhurriedly toward the door
EXT STREET - BEFORE GEIGERS HOUSE

as Marlowe gets into his car A short distance behind it
Mars car is parked the two guards in it Marlowe drives
away He expects a shot perhaps As he drives away he
burlesques it holds his hand out the window as if he were
testing the air for rain He drives on

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARLOWES OFFICE - EVENING - MARLOWE

sitting at his desk the phone pulled up in front of him
He smokes nervously -- he seems to have been waiting some
time -- and glances at his wristwatch The PHONE RINGS
He grabs it

MARLOWE

Yeah Whats the news Nothing
-- you mean they havent called you

(smiling sardonically)
Mrs Rutledge You are not a very
good liar I thought you were going
to trust me

(jerking the phone

away from his ear

with exaggerated

haste)
Why Mrs Rutledge

The PHONE CLICKS LOUDLY as the other end is slammed down on
the hook Marlowe replaces his instrument slowly He is
not clowning now He speaks softly to the telephone as
though to Vivian herself half in admiration half in
anger

MARLOWE
You crazy darn fool

He picks up his hat and goes out
EXT RANDALL PLACE - NIGHT

on Marlowe parked a few doors from the Randall Arms
obviously waiting for something

EXT RANDALL PLACE - AT THE RANDALL ARMS - NIGHT
as Vivian drives up parks and enters the apartment
EXT RANDALL PLACE - NIGHT

Marlowe gets out of his car and walks toward the Randall
Arms

INT UPPER RAILWAY - AT STAIRHEAD - NIGHT

as Marlowe climbs the last steps He walks down the hall
to 405 and presses the bell In one of the other
apartments a radio plays softly Presently the door of 405
opens noiselessly just wide enough to show the man who
stands behind it -- JOE BRODY whom we have seen before in
the back room of Geigers store and later driving the panel
truck He looks steadily at Marlowe and does not speak
His right hand holds the door A cigarette smolders in the
corner of his mouth

MARLOWE
Geiger

BRODY
(after a pause deadpan)
You said what

MARLOWE
Geiger Arthur Gwynne Geiger The
guy with the blackmail racket

Brodys right hand drops slowly out of sight -- we get the
impression hes reaching for a gun

BRODY
Dont know anybody by that name

Marlowe gives him a hard smile Brody doesnt like the
smile

MARLOWE
Youre Joe Brody
BRODY
So what
MARLOWE
So youre Joe Brody -- and you dont

know anybody named Geiger Thats
very funny

BRODY
Yeah You got a funny sense of
humor maybe Take it away and play
it somewhere else

Marlowe leans against the door and gives him a dreamy
smile

MARLOWE
You got Geigers stuff Joe I
got his sucker list We ought to
talk things over

BRODY
(glancing sideways
into the room then
back to Marlowe)
Theres plenty of time to talk
Make it tomorrow bud

He starts to close the door Marlowe bares his teeth and
shoves the door in against Brody viciously

MARLOWE
(pleasantly)
Well make it now

INT BRODYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A pleasant room nicely furnished French windows open
onto a balcony near the windows a closed door and near
the entrance another door with a heavy curtain drawn across
it Marlowe closes the entrance door behind him not
taking his eyes from Brody Brody stands still his hand
frozen underneath his coat his eyes wolfish Presently he
breaks letting his hand drop

BRODY
(shrugging -- turning away)
Why not if you think you got

something

Marlowe smiles glancing at the curtained doorway A
womans shoes show below the edge

MARLOWE
You alone Joe

BRODY
(meaningfully)
Yeah

Marlowe lifts the curtain high enough to show a very
spiffy leg -- Vivians in fact He admires it

MARLOWE
I could be alone with that almost
any time

He drops the curtain again goes to the davenport and sits
down tossing his hat beside him Brody picks up a box of
cigars from a nearby table walks to an easy chair opposite
Marlowe and sits

BRODY
Well Im listening

He drops his cigarette stub into a tray and puts a cigar
between his lips

BRODY
Cigar

He tosses one to Marlowe through the air As Marlowe
reaches out to catch it Brody takes a Police Special out of
the cigar box and covers Marlowe who relaxes slowly like
a steel spring

BRODY
Okay stand up Slow

MARLOWE

(not moving smiling

sardonically)
My my -- such a lot of guns around
town and so few brains Youre the
second guy Ive met today who seems
to think a gat in the hand means the
world by the tail

(derisively)
Put it down Joe

(as Joe doesnt move

only looks nastier)
The other guys name is Eddie Mars
Ever hear of him

BRODY
No

MARLOWE
If he ever gets wise to where you
were last night in the rain -- youll
hear of him

BRODY

(deadpan but
lowering the gun)
What would I be to Eddie Mars

MARLOWE
Not even a memory

BRODY
Dont get me wrong Im not a tough
guy -- just careful

MARLOWE

Youre not careful enough That play
with Geigers stuff was terrible I
saw it you know I dont think
Geigers boy friend liked it

BRODY
Carol Lundgren That punk

MARLOWE
Yeah Punk burns sometimes
(raises his voice
to the curtain door)
You might as well come out Vivian
Brody decided not to shoot me just yet
(as the curtain parts
slightly to show
Vivian undecided)
Oh yeah and bring the blonde with
you

Vivian comes out followed by Agnes Vivian looks
strained angry indomitable Agnes looks merely vicious

MARLOWE
(to Agnes)
Hello sugar

AGNES
(sourly)
Hello -- trouble

Agnes flounces down on the arm of an overstuffed chair
Brody watches his eyes hard and narrow expressionless
Vivian stands looking down at Marlowe She is definitely
not glad to see him

MARLOWE
So you dont really believe in
miracles -- or me

VIVIAN

Ive learned not to believe in
anything I dont need you
Marlowe I dont know how you
got here but I dont want you
Will you get out
MARLOWE
But darling the man with the gun
wont let me Look -- hes all
bothered and curious wondering
about stuff

BRODY
(menacingly)
Yeah -- you bet Im wondering
(looking sharply
from Vivian to
Marlowe then
to Agnes)
Agnes -- put some more light on so
I can see to shoot if I have to
(to Vivian as
Agnes switches
on a floor lamp)

You -- sit down and keep quiet
VIVIAN
Joe I swear I didnt have anything
to do
MARLOWE

(attempting to draw
her down beside him)

Dont argue with the man Here
(taking Vivians handbag
hefting it to assure
himself the wad of
bills is still inside
and grinning with
satisfaction placing
bag on couch)

Sit on this baby Go ahead You

wont need it

VIVIAN
Marlowe youre ruining everything

MARLOWE
(finally losing
patience yanking
her down bodily)
Sit down

Vivian struggles with him angrily Marlowe puts his arm
around her and smiles mockingly at Brody who raises his
gun slightly with unpleasant significance

BRODY
Okay fella Give out
He rises
his sheer

MARLOWE
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh Joe -- youre doing the
giving
BRODY
(leaning forward menacingly)
Listen
MARLOWE
Sure sure -- Youre the hard boy

with the gun Okay -- go ahead
blow holes in me That wont take
the cops off your neck

BRODY
What cops

MARLOWE
The cops that are going to find out
where all that lead in Geiger came
from

pacing with nervous catlike energy as he talks
ease and conviction holding Brody motionless

MARLOWE
You shot Geiger last night in the
rain The trouble is he wasnt
alone when you whiffed him Either
you didnt notice that -- and I
think you did -- or you got scared
and ran But you had nerve enough
to take the plate out of his camera
and you had nerve enough to come
back later and hide his corpse so
you could clean out his store before
the law knew it had a murder to
investigate

BRODY
(dangerously quiet)
Its kind of lucky for you I didnt
kill Geiger

MARLOWE
You can hold your breath for it just
the same

BRODY
You think you got me framed

MARLOWE
Dont go simple on me Joe I told
you there was a witness

BRODY
(suddenly seeing the light)
Carmen That little She would --
just that
Vivian reacts to this -- Marlowe puts his hand strongly on

her shoulder holding her quiet

MARLOWE
(laughing)
I thought you had that picture
of her

For a moment nobody moves There is a feeling of predatory
animals caged and waiting Vivian looks slowly up into
Marlowes face Then Brody puts his gun down on an end
table by his chair

BRODY
Lets all calm down here Lets all
just sit quiet a minute and think
(to Marlowe)
Who are you And what do you get
out of this

MARLOWE
Im just a guy paid to do other
peoples laundry And all I get
out of it is those pictures of
Carmen

BRODY
What pictures

MARLOWE
(as to a child)
Oh Joe

He sits down beside Vivian again talks to her as though
Brody were not present

MARLOWE

How do you like that He drops the
whole thing in my lap and then he
says What pictures

(to Agnes)
Poor Aggie I hate to think of you
standing outside the gas chamber
watching him while he chokes
AGNES
(to Brody)
Joe
BRODY
Shut up

(to Marlowe)
How did you get to me

MARLOWE
I never saw so many streets leading
to one place in my life Everywhere
I turn I fall over Joe Brody -- and
I been doing a lot of turning

BRODY
So Carmen says I gunned him

MARLOWE
With the photos in hand I might be
able to convince her she was wrong

BRODY

(after a pause scowling)
Im not saying I have or havent
got the photos Im only saying
Im broke Agnes and I are down to
nickels and we got to move on for
a while till this Geiger thing cools
off

MARLOWE
No dough from my client

BRODY

(to Vivian -- with

cold fury)
So you did go to somebody after all

(rising)
All right I dont need your five
grand I can take you off my back
Marlowe and I can get the cops taken
off I got a connection see I got
a handle on something big enough to
turn this town upside down --

MARLOWE
Why havent you pulled it

BRODY
Im going to And what I get out
of it will make your five grand look
like a roll of nickels

AGNES
Joe -- youre not gonna do it You
cant go up against Eddie Mars
hell --
BRODY
(furiously)

Shut up You have to let that big
mouth run off in front of --

He is interrupted by the sudden RINGING of the DOORBELL
They hold it all of them apprehensive of who may be on the
other side of the door while the RINGING STOPS and becomes
an insistent rapping Brody jerks open a desk drawer and
draws out a bone-handled automatic which he hands out to

Agnes She takes it shaking nervously Brody indicates
Marlowe
BRODY
(to Agnes)
If he gets funny use your own
judgment -- and the dame too

Agnes sits on the arm of the davenport beside Marlowe the
gun out of sight against him Marlowe observing her
shaking hand is not happy Brody puts his own gun in his
pocket leaving his hand on it and opens the door Carmen
Sternwood pushes him back in the room using a tiny
revolver which she pushes against his hips Carmen kicks
the door shut behind her Agnes leaps up standing out of
Marlowes reach her gun wavering between him and Carmen
She remains oblivious of the other people in the room
Vivian reacts to her entrance but says nothing Marlowe
sits still automatically stroking the sleepy cat

CARMEN
(to Brody with quiet
viciousness )
I want my pictures Joe

Brody is scared playing it very easy backing up as she
follows him

BRODY
Take it easy Carmen

MARLOWE
(sharply eyeing Agnes)
Carmen

AGNES
(to Carmen)
Get away from him you

Vivian rises sharply also getting out of Marlowes reach
she whips a small automatic out of her coat pocket

VIVIAN
(to Agnes trying to
watch her and Brody
at the same time)
Let her alone
(to Brody moving
toward him)
Joe if you dare to hurt her

MARLOWE
This is cute Hasnt anybody else
got a gun -- We can play ring

around the roses

CARMEN
(ignoring them
all -- to Brody)
You shot Arthur Geiger I saw you
I want my pictures

MARLOWE
For Petes sake all of you --
relax

No one hears him The three women continue to behave like

nervous cats -- the lead may start flying at anybody any
minute Brody still has his hand in his pocket he may
blast Carmen -- and Marlowe gunless sits in the middle of

the possible crossfire Vivian is closer to him than
Agnes having moved beyond the hampering arm of the couch
Marlowe moves abruptly Grabbing the couch cushion which
Vivian has just vacated he slings it at Agnes knocking
her off balance and down

Almost as a continuation of the same movement Marlowe makes
a dive for Vivians legs She falls on top of him they
struggle for the gun and Vivian bites Marlowes wrist He
whacks her across the side of the head with his free hand
wrenches the gun free and stands up Carmens attention
has been distracted slightly by this dust-up and Brody
strikes at her gun hand The gun goes off making a small
sharp crack shattering a pane of glass in the French
windows then skitters out of Carmens hand and across the
floor Agnes lets go a frightened bleat and collects
herself about to fire at Carmen Marlowe makes a quick
rush kicks the gun out of her hand and puts his foot on
Carmens gun just as Carmen gets there her hands and
knees reaching She puts her hand on Marlowes foot and
then looks up at him sidewise and giggles He bends over
and pats her on the back

MARLOWE
Get up angel You look like a
Pekinese

She draws back and rises as Marlowe scoops up her gun with
his left hand and drops it in his pocket The gun he has
taken from Vivian still dominates the room

MARLOWE
Everybody -- stand still

They do and he walks over and picks up Agnes gun
sticking that on in his hip pocket Brody is wiping the
nervous sweat off his face -- Agnes and Vivian still crouch
half stunned on the floor Marlowe laughs

MARLOWE
My dont we have fun You can get
up now kiddies
(walking over to Brody)
All right Joe Give

Brody goes sullenly to the desk opens a secret compartment
and pulls out a fat envelope hands it to Marlowe Marlowe
glances at the contents

MARLOWE
Sure this is all of it

BRODY
Yeah Now will you dust so I can
air out the room

Marlowe turns as the Sternwood girls approach him Carmen
gives him a languishing smile and holds out her hand for
the envelope

CARMEN
Can I have them now

MARLOWE
Ill take care of them for you

He hands the envelope to Vivian who thanks him with her
eyes

MARLOWE
(to Carmen and Vivian)
Youd better go on home now

Carmen continues to look at him sidelong biting her thumb

CARMEN
Youll take care of Carmen wont you

MARLOWE
Check

CARMEN
Could I have my gun back

MARLOWE
Later

CARMEN
Youre awfully cute

MARLOWE
Yeah
(stopping Vivian
as she passes
him heading
toward the door)
Countess -- you forgot something

He picks up her bag off the davenport and hands it to her
-- the scenes almost a repetition of the one in Marlowes
office with Marlowe still holding the handbag

MARLOWE
Did I hurt your head much

VIVIAN
(softly)
You -- and every other man I
ever met

She goes out Carmen follows her but at the door she
turns impulsively flings her arms around Marlowes neck
and kisses him

CARMEN
I like you

She runs off down the hall Marlowe looks at her puzzled
by her unusual attitude He closes the door and turns
again to Brody and Agnes Agnes considerably scratched
up gives him a snakely glare as she pats her wounds with a
handkerchief

BRODY
I got enough of you chum

MARLOWE
Yeah but theres still some
unfinished business Whats this
handle you got on Eddie Mars thats
big enough to turn the town upside
down

BRODY
Listen -- you got your pictures --
you got nothing more on me Get
outta here

MARLOWE
Sure I can go You can go too
Up to Quentin to the big chair in
the little room with the window They
stand outside Joe with stopwatches
They clock you in seconds but from
where you sit the centuries stink of
cyanide and they wrap around your
throat and a lot of people say its

easier than hanging -- I dont know
BRODY

What are you trying to do
MARLOWE

Keep your neck out of a noose -- in

return for some information Got an
alibi for last night

BRODY
I was right here with Agnes

MARLOWE
(picking up his hat)
Okay Joe You can only die once
even for a couple of murders

Brody stares at him as he turns to leave Agnes is scared
-- she puts her hand on Brodys shoulder

BRODY
Wait a minute What do you mean --
a couple of murders

MARLOWE
But then you dont have to worry
do you You got a connection

BRODY
Sit down

MARLOWE
(laughs sits down
on table edge)
Where were you about seven-thirty
last night
BRODY

(sullenly)
Watching Geigers place to see if
he has any friends too big for me to
kick out of the way when I take over
his business Its raining hard
Im shut up in my car and I dont
see anything except another car
parked in the alley below Geigers
I look at it -- its a Buick
registered to Mrs Rutledge Thats

tired waiting and went home

MARLOWE

BRODY

MARLOWE

In the Sheriffs garage It was

off Lido pier this morning There
was a dead man in it Owen Taylor
the Sternwoods chauffeur -- the guy

the pier and the hand throttle
pulled down

Brody gives Marlowe a stricken look Agnes tightens her
grip on him

AGNES

BRODY

You cant hang that one on me

MARLOWE

Brody stands up with Agnes

MARLOWE
If she is she doesnt have her gun
Dont you have any other friends

BRODY
(crossing to the
table picking
up the Colt)
Just about one
(going angrily
to the door)
I got enough of this

He opens the door about a foot with his left hand holding
the Colt ready by his thigh It is impossible to see who
stands in the hall Almost instantly two shots sound
close together Brody doubles up falls forward against
the door slamming it shut Agnes reacts but does not
scream Marlowe leaps up hauls Brody away from the door
-- Brody is quite dead Marlowe runs out

between the parked cars holding the gun at his side An
unlighted cigarette droops from his lips

MARLOWE
Got a match bud

Lundgren stands still taken by surprise not sure what to
do His hand rises instinctively to his leather jacket
but not inside A siren wails off going toward the
Randall Arms -- Lundgren turns his head instinctively
toward the sound and Marlowe steps in against him the
little gun jammed into Lundgrens midriff

MARLOWE
Me or the cops

LUNDGREN
Get away from me

MARLOWE
This is a small gun kid I can
give it to you through the belly and
in three months youll be well
enough to walk the last mile up at
Quentin

Lundgren holds it glaring at Marlowe then relaxes

LUNDGREN
What do you want

MARLOWE
(turning --
indicating car)
Get into my car kid
(as Lundgren obeys
-- slowly)
Under the wheel You drive

INT MARLOWES CAR - NIGHT

As Lundgren slides under the wheel from the curb side
and Marlowe gets in beside him keeping him covered

MARLOWE

Lets go to Laverne Terrace --
Geigers house

(pleasantly -- as

Lundgren starts

the car)
And by the way Carol -- if you shot
Brody for friendships sake you shot
the wrong guy

Lundgren gives him a hard nasty look and laughs

MARLOWE

(softly)
Not all friendship was it Yeah
money talks all right It talks
and its breath smells of blood

(laughing to himself)
I told Brody that sometimes punk
burns

EXT GEIGERS HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Marlowe and Lundgren stand on the footbridge Marlowe
still carries the toy gun He pulls the keys out of his
pocket with his left hand and gives them to Lundgren

MARLOWE
You open it

Lundgren starts to take the keys then slams Marlowe a
quick hard punch on the jaw Marlowe rocks back but
doesnt fall -- he smiles and throws the gun down at
Lundgrens feet

MARLOWE
Maybe you need this

Lundgren goes for the gun As he bends down Marlowe steps
in fast bringing his knee up into Lundgrens face The
force of the blow straightens Lundgren up and Marlowe
uncorks a terrific left Lundgren falls heavily Marlowe
unperturbed unlocks the door puts the gun back in his
pocket and starts to drag Lundgren inside

DISSOLVE TO
INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MARLOWE AND LUNDGREN

Lundgren is stretched out on the couch his hands bound
behind him under his back A single lamp shines down into
his face He has bled somewhat from the nose Marlowe
sits on the couch twisted sideways so that Lundgrens
head is strained back over his knee Marlowe helps the
straining by having his left hand wound in Lundgrens hair
His manner is gentle almost friendly

MARLOWE
(softly)
Youre going to cop a plea brother --
dont ever think youre not And
when you talk youre going to say
just what I want you to say and
nothing else You hear me sweetheart

Lundgren makes no reply staring stonily into the light

MARLOWE
(almost caressingly)
Its your face Carol You can do
what you want with it

He jerks Lundgrens head back harder and raises his free
hand bringing it down

DISSOLVE TO
INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marlowe stands at the telephone speaking into the
instrument His face is beaded with sweat his collar
open He smokes jerkily -- we get the impression he hasnt
enjoyed slapping Lundgren around In bg Lundgren lies
on the couch both hands over his face

MARLOWE
(into phone)
Hello Bernie -- Yeah Marlowe How
you fixed for red points Bernie
Well come on up to 7244 Laverne

DISSOLVE TO
INT GEIGERS BEDROOM - MARLOWE AND OHLS - NIGHT

They stand by the bed looking down Geiger is laid out
on the bed Two strips of Chinese embroidery cover the
wounds on his breast in the shape of a cross his hands
folded over them The only light in the room comes from
two black candles burning on either side of the bed

OHLS
Nice gesture of friendship
Lundgren

MARLOWE
Yeah

Ohls bends over lifts up the Chinese embroidery studies
Geigers chest then straightens up

OHLS
So thats where the three slugs went
out of Owen Taylors gun Well I
can understand that
(making a gesture
of distaste)
Lets get out of here

INT GEIGERS SITTING ROOM - CAROL

sprawled sideways on the couch leaning his head against
the wall showing signs of his recent battle with Marlowe
Marlowe sits in bg easily smoking Ohls stands over
Carol Ohls is annoyed with Marlowe shows it in
succeeding scenes

OHLS
(to Carol)
Do you admit shooting Brody

CAROL
(not moving -- not
opening his eyes)

Take a jump Jack

MARLOWE
(through smoke)
He doesnt have to admit it Ive
got the gun
OHLS

(he rouses himself)
Ive called Wilde Come on Well
deliver this punk to him
He leans down grasps Carols arm

OHLS
Get up
(Carol flings his
hand off -- rises

sullenly -- Ohls

moves in beside him)
Come on Marlowe The DA will
want to see the man that solves
single-handed what we make busts on
And on the way to him you and I
will talk a little too

Marlowe rises follows as Ohls takes Carol out snapping
off the lights as he passes them and all exit

hastily from a party obviously At corner of the desk sits
Captain Cronjager of the city police homicide detail in
plain clothes He is a cold hatchet-faced man obviously
displeased with the way things have happened Ohls enters
followed by Marlowe

OHLS

(to Wilde)
Evening Chief Evening Cronjager

(he pulls up a

chair to sit down)
Meet Sherlock Holmes gentlemen

(to Marlowe)
Grab yourself a chair -- unless
youd rather be on your feet while
Cronjager gives you a going-over

WILDE
Sit down Marlowe Well try to
handle Captain Cronjager But I
think youll admit you were going a
little fast wont you

MARLOWE
Thanks

He sits down takes out a cigarette holds it unlighted in
his hand Ohls and Cronjager stare at him

OHLS

Fast is right But just wait and
watch him go when his foot finally
does slip

(to Cronjager)
Maybe youd better tell Sherlock
Holmes here what else you got on
the Randall Place killing

CRONJAGER
A blonde Down on the street
trying to start a car that didnt
belong to her Hers was right next
to it the same model She acted
rattled so the boys brought her in
and she spilled Claims she didnt
see the killer

OHLS
(still riding Marlowe)
Hes in the back office now --
handcuffed Heres the gun

He takes Carols gun from his pocket drops it on the desk
Cronjager looks at the gun but without touching it After
a moment Wilde chuckles enjoying Cronjagers discomfiture
and Ohls annoyance

OHLS

But thats just one of them

(he stares at Marlowe

while he addresses

Cronjager)
You heard about a car being lifted
out of the surf at Lido pier this
morning with a dead guy in it

MARLOWE
(mildly)
Do you have to be coy about it
OHLS

(staring at Marlowe

-- addressing

Cronjager with

malicious sarcasm)
Sure The guy they found drowned in
the car shot another guy last night
in your territory a guy named Geiger
who ran a racket in the back room of
a bookstore on the boulevard The
punk I got in the back office worked
for Geiger

(to Marlowe)
Youre on the air Lets have it

MARLOWE
Thats all When I finally located
the lad that moved the packing case
out of Geigers back room Geigers
blonde secretary was with him It
was Brody While I was trying to
persuade Brody to tell what became
of the packing case the doorbell
rang again and Brody opened the door
and somebody shot him twice You
know the rest of it

(he lights his cigarette)

OHLS
Except what was in the packing case
-- yes

MARLOWE
(smoking)
Brody didnt tell me

OHLS
(staring at Marlowe)
You see Cronjager Even as smart
as he is hes got to guess
sometimes too

MARLOWE
My guess is the same as yours
Black mailing stuff Geigers
customers must have been wearing a
path across that rug coming in to
knock on that locked door and pay
their monthly installments

OHLS
(staring at Marlowe)
Thats right Cronjager Maybe
Sherlocks even going to show us
his evidence for guessing that

MARLOWE
Do you folks still guess when you
have evidence

WILDE
(sharply)
Thats enough of this
(to Marlowe)
So Taylor killed Geiger because he

was in love with the Sternwood girl

And Brody followed Taylor sapped
him and took the photograph and
pushed Taylor into the ocean And
the punk killed Brody because the
punk thought he should have
inherited Geigers business and
Brody was throwing him out

MARLOWE
Thats how I figure it

WILDE
(extends his hand)
Lets see your evidence

OHLS
Give pal Hiding murders
Spending a whole day foxing around
so that this punk of Geigers can
have plenty of time to commit
another one

Marlowe takes from his coat and puts on the desk before
Wilde the three notes and Geigers card to General Stern

wood

and the notebook with its code list of names

Wilde

looks at them lights a cigar Ohls and Cronjager rise and
look at the articles over Wildes shoulders
smokes quietly

WILDE
(after a time)
These notes If General Sternwood
paid them it would be because he
was afraid of something else Do
you know what he was afraid of

MARLOWE
No

Marlowe

Wilde stares at Marlowe

WILDE
(after a moment)
Have you told your story complete

MARLOWE
I left out some personal matters
(they stare at each other)
I intend to keep on leaving them out

WILDE
Why

MARLOWE
Ive still got a client You
recommended me to him through Bernie
My first duty is to him

Wilde Ohls and Cronjager all stare at Marlowe He smokes
quietly Wilde staring at Marlowe makes a slight signal
with his hand

OHLS
(to DA)
Okay But youre wasting time
If youd let me handle Sherlock

WILDE
Thatll do Bernie

OHLS

(to Cronjager)
I want to surrender a prisoner
to you Come on

(he goes toward door

-- Cronjager following

As Ohls opens the door

he pauses and looks

back at Marlowe To

Marlowe )
I like you Better and better
Some day Im going to like you so
well I wont be able to bear having
you out of my sight

He and Cronjager exit close the door Wilde puffs his

cigar

staring at Marlowe Marlowe smokes quietly

WILDE
(after a time)
Do you know why Im not tearing
your ear off
MARLOWE
I expected to lose both of them

WILDE
(smoking -- watching
him steadily --
after a time)
What are you getting for all this

MARLOWE
Twenty-five a day and expenses

WILDE
And for that money youre willing to
get yourself in Dutch with the law
enforcement of this county maybe
lose your license

MARLOWE
(quietly)
Ive still got a client

WILDE

Is he still just a client

(Marlowe doesnt

answer -- smoking)
Listen to me son My father was a
close friend of old General
Sternwood I like him as well as
you do Ive done all my office
permits -- maybe a good deal more --
to save him from grief But in the
long run nothing can save him
except dying

MARLOWE
Yeah -- the big sleep Thatll cure
his grief

WILDE
It cures all the grief You really

dont know yet what General Sternwood
wants with you

MARLOWE
Yes To settle this business with
Geiger

WILDE
Hes afraid that ex-bootlegger
Regan that he took up about a year
ago is mixed up in this somewhere
What he really wants is for you to
find out that Regan isnt

MARLOWE
Regans no blackmailer I knew him
Wilde shrugs slightly
WILDE

Maybe youd better find him and
prove it

MARLOWE

Maybe I had

Marlowe rises

He indicates the objects on the desk

GREGORY

He blew on the sixteenth of September

No one reported it We got into it
by finding the car It was the
chauffeurs day off so nobody at
Sternwoods saw Regan take his car
out of the garage We found the car
four days later in a garage belonging
to a ritzy bungalow court on Sunset
The garage man reported it to the
stolen car detail said it didnt
belong there We couldnt find who
it belonged to

MARLOWE
And of course Eddie Mars wife
couldnt tell you because she had
disappeared too

GREGORY
(stares at Marlowe
a moment)
If you knew so much already why
did you come to me

MARLOWE
Sorry Go ahead

GREGORY
So you have been talking to some
Sternwood about Regan

MARLOWE
Why not You just said nobody has
accused anybody of any crime yet

GREGORY
Yes Mrs Mars was gone too
disappeared within two days of
the day Regans car was left in
the garage

MARLOWE
What are the angles

GREGORY
Mrs Mars lived in the apartment the
garage belonged to Regan was known
to carry a roll fifteen grand in
his clothes all the time --

MARLOWE
Yes I had heard that

GREGORY
It dont seem to have been any secret
to anybody that Regan was sweet on
Mars wife

MARLOWE
So it looks like they went off
together

GREGORY

Regan had fifteen grand in cash with
him Mrs Mars had some rocks and
a car of her own -- making two cars
available Everything disappeared
but one of the cars

MARLOWE
What did she look like Have you
got a photograph

GREGORY
No A blonde She wont be
now though

MARLOWE

What was she before she married Mars

GREGORY
A torcher

He exits

Maybe she isnt anything now Maybe
neither of them are

more excited than

Do you want another sixteen thousand

Something the matter Mrs Rutledge

to speak when
he continues
easily courteous)

A door opens in the wall
The crowd falls silent turns
comes out the door smiling indifferent immaculate
in his jacket pockets as he strolls to the table

as Mars
hands

MARS (CONTD)
If youre not playing any more you
must let me send someone home with
you

VIVIAN
One more play Eddie All of it on
the red I like red Its the
color of blood

Mars stares at her a second smiles faintly takes from his
inner breast pocket a large pinseal wallet with gold
corners very elegant and tosses it carelessly to the
croupier without opening it

MARS
Cover her bet in even thousands
(to the gaping crowd)
If no one objects to this turn of
the wheel being for the lady alone

The crowd remains breathless Vivian leans down and shoves
the whole mass of her winnings savagely onto the RED
diamond of the layout stands back The croupier leans
without haste and rapidly and skillfully counts the money
stacks it places all but a few scattered chips and bills
rakes these into a neat pile and pushes it off the layout
with his rake leaving the bet on the RED

Then he opens Mars wallet with the same detached deliberate
swiftness draws out two flat packets of thousand-dollar
bills He breaks the tape around one counts off six

bills adds them to the unbroken packet puts the four

other bills back into Mars wallet and lays the wallet

aside as carelessly as if it were a packet of paper

matches Mars does not touch the wallet He stands as
before elegant detached courteous The croupier spins
the wheel with one hand snaps the ball into it with the
other draws back and folds his arms

steps quickly and soundlessly into the shrubbery

man crouches behind a shrub beside the path watching the

watches the path again reacts as FAINT SOUND OF FEET
begins Vivian enters walking rapidly along the path
clutching her handbag to her As she passes the shrub the
man steps quickly out Vivian stops but makes no sound

THUG

This is a gun lady Gentle now
Just hand me the bag

For a moment Vivian does not move Then she draws a
deep breath as if to scream still clutching the handbag

THUG
Yell and Ill cut you in half

bag thrusts his
hand inside)
It better be here --

MARLOWE

(quietly from behind him)
Hi pal

(the thug stops dead

After a second his

empty hand starts

to steal upward)
Easy now

As Marlowe and the thug stare it out tensely two shadowy
figures emerge from the shrubbery One of them slugs
Marlowe from behind As he falls the other grabs for
Vivian apparently about to do the same for her She lets
out a wild scream and starts shooting from the pocket One

of the thugs cries out in mingled pain and anger -- in the
distance people begin to shout -- the noise has attracted
attention

THUG

You clumsy yap

SECOND THUG

They run vanishing into the dark shrubbery Vivian
crouches beside Marlowe helping as he tries to sit up

of your other habits

MARLOWE

VIVIAN

secretive while

he tries to follow

her catch up with

whats going on)
So youre a killer

MARLOWE
Does that mean Geiger or Brody --
or maybe both of them

VIVIAN
Why not
(she looks at him
Suddenly her manner
changes she speaks
with a quiet and
complete sincerity)
I wish I was sure you had done it

Then I could thank you -- in my
fathers name He still has pride
at least

MARLOWE

hurt is That Father might die
despising his own blood It was

together takes out

a cigarette slumps

back in the seat as

Marlowe strikes a

match But when he

holds the match to

her he sees her

lying back in the

seat the cigarette

in her mouth looking

at him with lazy and

inviting challenge

When he brings the

match near without

moving she blows it

out When she speaks

it is almost a whisper)
Move closer

Marlowe stares at her After a moment he flings the dead
match deliberately away puts his arm around her
approaches his face to hers Suddenly Vivian flings the
unlighted cigarette over her shoulder toward the window
clasps him in her arms

VIVIAN
Hold me close

They kiss a long kiss Marlowe raises his head at last

VIVIAN

MARLOWE

flings him back with one arm sits violently up

VIVIAN
So thats the way it is

MARLOWE

takes out a wisp

surprised You dont even thank
me for saving it for you

VIVIAN

INT MARLOWES APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Marlowe enters closing the door behind him The only
light in the room filters in from a street lamp outside
Marlowe flings his hat carelessly toward a chair evidently
out of long habit and starts across the room toward the
kitchen in search of a drink and in too much of a hurry to
bother turning on lights

INT MARLOWES APARTMENT - REVERSE ANGLE FROM KITCHEN -
NIGHT

As Marlowe approaches his body filling the fg As he
reaches the kitchen door a lamp goes on suddenly behind
him He freezes his body blocking the view of what is
behind him Then as he turns slowly we see past him --
Carmen Sternwood sits in an armchair the one in fact
into which Marlowe has pitched his hat Carmen holds it
up smiling She wears an evening gown more or less
covered by a light wrap
CARMEN
(coyly)

What does the hatcheck girl get for

a tip

MARLOWE
(grimly)

Im trying to think of something
appropriate -- How did you get in

here

CARMEN
Bet you cant guess

MARLOWE
(bleakly lighting a
cigarette)

Bet I can You came in through the

keyhole like Peter Pan

CARMEN
Whos he
MARLOWE
Guy I used to know around the
poolroom
CARMEN
Youre cute
MARLOWE

And getting cuter every minute How

did you get in

CARMEN

I showed your manager your card I
stole it from Vivian I told him you
told me to come here and wait for you

MARLOWE

Fine Now tell me how youre

going to get out

CARMEN
(slipping off her wrap)
Im not going

She looks at him -- a surprisingly honest steady look
This is a different Carmen -- a puzzled half-frightened
girl who seems to be waking from a dream -- not sure she

wants to but unable to help herself

Marlowe looks back

at her nastily But he senses a difference and his voice

is surprisingly gentle when he speaks
MARLOWE
Listen Carmen Im tired Ive
had a hard days work I like you
Im your friend and any other time
Id be tickled to death to see you
But not now Will you please go
home

CARMEN
(quietly hungrily)
Are you really my friend Phil

MARLOWE
Sure

CARMEN
I need a friend Phil someone
to --

She stops apparently confused groping for words

MARLOWE
Someone to what Carmen

CARMEN
I dont know

She looks up at him again searching his face As though
Marlowe is a magnet she is drawn to her feet still
looking at him She comes close but does not touch him

CARMEN
(almost to herself)
What is it in you Im afraid of
you and yet theres something
straight and hard Phil I wish
Id met you before -- a long time
ago
MARLOWE
(trying to Josh
her out of it)
Hey hey Whats all this
CARMEN
I dont know
(angrily)

Why did you have to come I was
all right I was fine

MARLOWE
And now
CARMEN
(almost weeping)
I dont know

MARLOWE
Look -- you and I want to go on
being friends -- and you shouldnt

be here
(holding her
wrap for her)
Be a good girl

During this speech Carmen seems to take the wrap But the
wrap falls on to the floor revealing the fact that Carmen
is holding Marlowes hand

CARMEN
Do you think I can be a good girl

MARLOWE
It doesnt matter what I think

Carmen kisses his hand

CARMEN
But dont you want me to try
MARLOWE
(trying to free his
hand now)

I just want you to get out of here

CARMEN
(clinging to his hand)
Youve got funny thumbs Can I
bite it

Before he can answer she raises his hand starts to put
his thumb into her mouth With a sharp violent motion he
flings her hand away

MARLOWE
Stick to your own thumb Hasnt it
carried you all right all your life

CARMEN
(obediently)
All right

She puts her thumb in her mouth or her hand to her face in
such a way as to appear to be sucking her thumb as usual
Marlowe takes up the fallen wrap and approaches with it
MARLOWE
Okay Take your thumb now and
get out of here

CARMEN
(giggling)
Its not my thumb See

She removes the object from her mouth and holds it up for
him to see It is the white queen from his set of
chessmen Marlowe stares at her for a moment then he
slaps her terrifically across the face rocking her back
The chessman falls from her hand and she stares at Marlowe
frightened now as he walks toward her

CARMEN
Do that again

MARLOWE
(seething with
repressed rage
almost whispering)
Get out

CARMEN
Maybe if people had done that to me
more often I would have been good
now

Marlowe reaches her grasps he arm hurries her across to
the door jerks the door open almost hurls her through it
flings the wrap after her slams the door turns the bolt
as she rattles the knob then begins to hammer on the door
He turns and crosses the room rapidly to the bath while she
still beats on the door and washes his hand savagely with
soap and water his face now actually beaded with sweat

The KNOCKING CONTINUES He examines his hand is still not
satisfied jerks open shaving cabinet looks at the
innocuous bottles of mouthwash etc when what he needs is
carbolic acid goes to the kitchen while the knocking still
continues jerks savagely from the shelf his last bottle of
whiskey

It is about half full He jerks the stopper out flings it
away and pours about a dollars worth of expensive Scotch
over his hand flings the bottle away returns to the
living room and while the KNOCKING STILL CONTINUES he
kneels at the hearth lays the delicate chess piece on it
and with a heavy fire-dog hammers the chess-piece into
dust still beating even after the piece has vanished his
blows at last drowning out the SOUND of the knocking on the
door

Marlowe hands her folded bills She counts them rapidly by
the dash light then puts them in her handbag

AGNES

MARLOWE

weeks ago We passed a brown coupe
and I saw the girl who was driving
She was Eddie Mars wife There
was a guy with her -- the watchdog
Canino Theyre people you dont
forget even if you only saw them
once So we got curious and Joe
tailed them About a mile east of
Realito theres a side road and
nothing around it but brush and
hills Just off the highway theres
a two-bit garage and paintshop run
by a guy named Art Huck -- hot car
drop likely -- and a frame house
behind it Thats where Eddie Mars

Marlowe takes the license holder from the steering post and
puts it in his pocket then leans lower behind the wheel

Marlowe approaches the garage There is a sign on the
blank side wall -- Marlowe holds a flashlight on it and we
SEE the lettering of the sign

Marlowe goes round to the front The big doors are closed
but a streak of light shows through the crack Marlowe
hesitates then walks past them to glance at the house
EXT FRAME HOUSE - MARLOWES ANGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)
The only signs of life are the light from the shaded

windows and Caninos brown coupe parked in front by a row
of stunted trees

EXT HUCKS GARAGE - NIGHT (RAIN)

At the door as Marlowe goes up and hammers on it with the
butt of his heavy flashlight There is a moment of
silence Then the inside light goes off Marlowe centers
his flash in a white circle of light on the doors

HUCK
(speaking through
the door)
Whaddaya want

MARLOWE
Open up I got two flats back on
the highway and only one spare

HUCK
Sorry mister Were closed up
Better try Realito

Marlowe doesnt appreciate this He kicks the door hard
and keeps on kicking it until a second voice -- Caninos
voice -- speaks from close inside Then he stops to
listen

CANINOS VOICE
Okay Art -- open up for the wise

guy

A BOLT SQUEALS and half the door opens inward Marlowes
flash outlines a gaunt hard face Hucks face Then Huck
swings a gun down across the flash knocking it out of
Marlowes hand still burning

HUCK
Kill that spot bud

Marlowe picks up the flash turning it off Light goes on
inside the garage revealing HUCK a tall man in dirty
coveralls He backs away from the door keeping Marlowe
covered

HUCK
Come inside and shut the door

INT HUCKS GARAGE - NIGHT

as Marlowe closes the door behind him There is the usual
paraphernalia of a garage and two cars One is being
painted a spray-gun lying on the fender the other is
Carmen Sternwoods Packard convertible Canino lounges
easily in the shadows by the bench The RAIN BEATS on the
tin roof

MARLOWE
(indicating Hucks gun)
You could scare off a lot of trade
that way

HUCK
Im too far out of town to take
chances
(pointedly)
You can get yourself hurt kicking
on doors

CANINO
(softly)
Cut it out Art You run a garage
dont you

MARLOWE
(not looking at Canino)
Thanks
(to Huck)

I suppose you can fix flats

HUCK
(putting the gun
in his pocket)
As good as you can make ‘em bud
But right now Im busy

CANINO
(pleasantly)
Art -- you got time to fix his
tires
MARLOWE
You can use my spare -- thatll
help some
HUCK

Listen I told you Im busy with
a spray job

CANINO
Its too damp for a good spray job
Art Get moving -- and take two
jacks

HUCK

Now wait a minute

Canino looks at Huck with a soft quiet-eyed stare then
away again not saying anything Huck wilts and moves
away pulling on a raincoat and banging out with a socket
wrench a hand jack and wheeling a dolly

Canino closes the door behind him and returns to the
workbench Marlowe watches silently lighting a cigarette

CANINO
Bet you could use a drink Wet
the inside and even up

MARLOWE
Thanks

Canino produces a bottle and two glasses from under the
bench pours two shots and hands one to Marlowe They
salute -- Canino drinks and Marlowe remembering Harry
Jones and the cyanide cocktail hesitates then drinks
also

CANINO
(casually)
Live around here

MARLOWE
No Just got in from Reno and
Carson City

CANINO
The long way round huh Business
trip
MARLOWE
Partly And in a hurry
CANINO
Too bad -- you may have a long wait

(reaching for Marlowes
empty glass)
How about another to pass the time

DISSOLVE TO
EXTREME CLOSE - A WHEEL - NIGHT

-- the tire already on a spreader and loose from the rim
A mans hands and feet working at the job viciously The
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Art Huck as he rips out the tube
Marlowe and Canino stand almost as before by the
workbench

HUCK
(grumbling over
above action)
I dont have enough to do -- guys
have to get flats in the middle of
a cloudburst

CANINO

(laughing)
Dont crab so much You can use
an extra bath

(taking a roll of

coins out of his

pocket tossing

them idly in the

palm of his hand)
Just get busy

Huck carries the tube to an airhose and starts to fill it

HUCK
I am busy brother Plenty
busy

He starts to place the tube in the galvanized tub under the
hose then turns swiftly lifting the tube high and brings
it down over Marlowes head and shoulders a perfect
ringer Marlowe unable to reach the gun in his pocket
bends forward trying to throw Huck over his back Canino
steps in lightly like a dancer his hand closed hard over
the roll of coins and hangs one with delicate precision on
Marlowes jaw

Marlowes tough -- he goes on fighting although hes
already out on his feet Huck pulls his head back by the
hair as Canino clips him again with the weighted fist
Marlowe tries but its no use He goes down and stays
that way

INT MARS HIDEOUT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A small room in keeping with the exterior -- furnished
comfortably but not luxuriously The only light comes from
a floor lamp beside the davenport where Marlowe lies His
hands are cuffed behind him his feet roped to the leg of
the davenport He is still out his face considerably the
worse for wear Vivian sits beside him on a straight
chair holding a half empty glass in her hand She seems
to have forgotten about it She seems to have forgotten
everything but Marlowe -- who begins to come out of it He
opens his eyes presently and looks at Vivian -- he doesnt
seem surprised He winces and shuts his eyes again

MARLOWE
(thickly)
Move the light honey

Vivian rises and turns the light away from his face He
looks up at her again

MARLOWE
(still groggy)
Thats better -- where are the
boys -- out digging a grave
VIVIAN
(desperately)
Phil why did you have to go on
with this
MARLOWE

Why did you

Vivian turns away from him -- shes obviously keyed up
scared desperate

VIVIAN
Ive only known one fool as big as
you

MARLOWE

(after a pause)
You might spare me a little of that
drink youre not using

Vivian goes to him sits down and holds the glass to
Marlowes lips then touches his battered face with her
fingertips

VIVIAN
(shakily)
Your face looks like a collision
met
MARLOWE

It wont last long even this good
(after a pause
looking up at
Vivian softly)
Ill give it back to you -- Ive
only known one fool as big as you

They hold it a twisted uncomfortable moment and then MONA
MARS enters She is tall blonde strikingly beautiful --
a woman who knows her way around yet having a certain
dignity and fineness

MARLOWE
You would be Mrs Eddie Mars the
blond that Shawn Regan didnt run
away with
MONA
Why did you have to make trouble
Eddie wasnt doing you any harm
I was never in love with Shawn --
we were just good friends But
you know perfectly well that if
I hadnt hid out here when Shawn
disappeared the police would have
been certain Eddie killed him

MARLOWE
(quietly)
But he did kill him

MONA
(after a pause
with quiet dignity)
Eddies not that sort of man

MARLOWE

You mean Eddie never kills people
MONA

No
MARLOWE

You really believe that dont you

And in a way I suppose youre right

MONA

(sincerely)
Im married to Eddie Mars I love
him I know whats inside of him

MARLOWE
Well if Eddies such a nice guy
Id like to talk to him without
Canino around You know what Canino
will do -- beat my teeth out and then
kick me in the stomach for mumbling

VIVIAN
Youll get your talk Phil Caninos
gone for Eddie

MARLOWE
Leaving Art Huck within call I
suppose Well I suppose nobodys
luck holds forever
(to Vivian)
You could really have gone to Mexico

you know Youd have liked it better

Blood doesnt spatter that far

MONA
Oh stop talking that way

Vivian and Marlowe are no longer conscious of her presence
having retired into a private world of their own

MARLOWE
But then you couldnt go could you
The border police would have checked
you through alone and too many
people might have seen you --
without Shawn Regan Much safer to
come down here with Mona Much

safer -- especially for Eddie Mars
VIVIAN
I did it as much for you Why

wouldnt you believe me Why
wouldnt you stop

MARLOWE
Too many people tried to make me
And besides I knew Shawn Regan --
and I know you

They look at each other -- and Mona Mars takes herself
quietly out of the room

VIVIAN
Why did I have to meet you Why
out of all the men in the city did
my father have to call you in

MARLOWE
Things happen that way sometimes
Light me a cigarette

She takes one from a table lights it and bends over to
place it between Marlowes lips Marlowes eyes hold her
as though his hands were on her shoulders she sits down

MARLOWE
(softly)
You know what theyre going to do
dont you You know the only thing
they can do

Vivians hands grip the shoulders of his coat She shuts
her eyes and drops her head holding herself rigid

MARLOWE
(still softly)
Its not pretty is it -- even from
a distance And when youre right
on top of it it isnt pretty at all

VIVIAN
(rising abruptly)
Oh stop it Phil Stop it
Nothings going to happen

MARLOWE
Monas in love with Eddie Mars but
youre not Are you going through
with it

Vivian moves away as far from him as she can get and
stands with her back to him rigid staring at the
curtained window as though she could see through it
Marlowe studies her then laughs a quiet sardonic chuckle
and relaxes leaning back on the cushion

MARLOWE
Pride is a great thing isnt it
And courage -- and honor -- and
love All the things you read about
in the copybooks -- only in the
copybooks nothing ever gets tangled
The road always lies so straight
and clear and the signs say to love
and honor and be brave Take this
thing out of my mouth will you
honey Its burning me

Vivian comes slowly to him and takes the cigarette stub
from his lips She hesitates then goes down onto the
couch dropping the cigarette on the floor Her arms go
around Marlowe her mouth crushed to his When she breaks
for air putting her cheek against his she is almost
crying Marlowe is far from unmoved himself turning his
head against hers hard

MARLOWE
(after a pause whispering)
Get a knife and cut this rope
off me

Vivian rises runs out of the room The SOUND of a kitchen
drawer being opened comes OVER from os then the RATTLE
of CUTLERY Vivian returns almost at once with a knife and
slashes the rope from Marlowes feet Dropping the knife
she helps him get up -- hes not too steady on his legs
They cross the room together Vivian with her arm around
Marlowe The handcuffs glittering on Marlowes wrists

From outside comes the SOUND of a car skidding to a stop
Mona Mars appears in the doorway holding a gun

MONA
(quietly without menace)
Eddie is here -- I think youd
better wait

EXTREME CLOSE - CANINOS HAND

opening playing idly with the roll of coins The CAMERA
PULLS BACK -- we are still in the living room Marlowe is
sitting on the couch Vivian beside him -- his hands are
still cuffed behind him but his feet are free

Canino leans unobtrusively against the wall -- near
Marlowe Eddie Mars holds center stage moving like a lion
keyed up for the kill Mona Mars the gun forgotten in her
hand sits in the bg watching Her face is still
intent

VIVIAN
(quietly)
Eddie -- this is where I get off

MARS
You bought a ticket for the whole
run Countess -- destination unknown
Keep your mouth out of this
(to Marlowe)
Youre making it tough for me
soldier

MARLOWE
Not me Eddie Murder Murder can
make things tough for anybody You
keep tripping over it all the time

MARS
(contemptuous 1y )
Murder I havent killed anybody

MARLOWE
Not personally maybe -- but your
hand is behind Caninos aiming the
gun -- or pouring the cyanide into

Harry Jones glass

(as Mars gives him

a startled look)
Yeah -- I was there in the next
room Canino had a gun and I
didnt so all I could do was
watch I kind of liked Harry
Jones

MARS
You kind of like too many people
soldier

MONA
Eddie -- what does he mean Whats

happened Who was Harry Jones

MARS
Hes just talking Maybe you better
get out Mona We may have to push
him around a little before we get
through

MARLOWE
(to Mona)
Yeah -- push me a little right
over the edge Eddie wont spoil
his manicure to do it -- but
Canino wont mind Hes used to
having his hands dirty

Canino leans over and slaps Marlowe hard across the face
Vivian springs up toward Canino -- Eddie Mars grabs her
looking toward Mona Mona has never seen that look on
Eddies face before

MARS
(quietly)
Get out Mona

MONA
Eddie

MARS
Get out

Mona studies him -- it seems that she is looking at a
stranger a stranger who frightens her someone evil and
beyond the pale She seems to grow in stature and dignity
even as her heart realizes how far down the wrong road it
has traveled She turns then slowly and goes out

After she has gone Vivian wrenches free from Mars grip
There is something rather wonderful about her now -- a
blazing catlike courage She faces Eddie Mars

VIVIAN
You dont dare go through with this
Eddie

MARS

You think I cant get away with it

VIVIAN
You think Im going to let you
get away with it

Mars studies her then Marlowe -- realizes what the score
is and smiles sardonically

MARS

You women kill me Youll spend
years and wreck lives to get
something you want and then
throw it all away in a minute
because some guy has a new way
of putting his mouth on yours

(sitting down

easily smiling)
All right Countess While were
doing all this thinking do you
think youre going to have a chance
not to let me get away with it

Silence as this sinks in Vivian sits down quietly beside
Marlowe who looks at both her and Mars with a cold
cynical smile

MARLOWE

(laughing softly)
Its amazing how fast a beautiful
friendship breaks when a dead body
falls on top of it Which one
of you killed Regan If he was
shot in the back I1l bet on you
Eddie because thats the only way
you could have got to him But if
he took it from the front --

(looking at Vivian)
I can see how you both would have
been jealous of Mona

Vivian stares at him a hard shocked look as though
Marlowe is something not human Marlowe gives it back to
her -- then almost at once Canino steps forward and places
his hand on Marlowes head bending it back his fingers
and thumb biting cruelly into Marlowes temples Canino
smiles as though he is very fond of Marlowe

CANINO
(gently amused)
Ever see a dick with such a one-track
mind Hes sitting right on the edge
of a hole in the ground but he still
cares who killed Regan Want to tell
him Eddie Want to send him to bed

happy

Mars makes an annoyed gesture and starts to get up then
freezes as Mona speaks from the doorway

MONA
(very quietly)
Eddie
Everyone turns to look at her -- there is a quality of fate

in her voice She leans almost negligently against the
door jamb wearing a heavy coat holding a big felt hat in
her hands

MONA
Ive been a good wife to you Eddie
-- as good a wife as youd let me
be I believed in you and there
wasnt anything I wouldnt have done

for you -- anything but this
MARS
Dont be a fool Mona Cant you
see
MONA
(slowly)

I can only see one thing Ive been
married to a killer and Ive helped
him kill

She turns and goes out Mars rises looking after her

MARS
(to Canino)
Hold the fort Canino Ill be back

He goes out after Mona not even waiting for Caninos nod
of assent Canino goes to a window and peers through the
crack of the blind still keeping Marlowe covered We HEAR
a car start outside and drive off

CANINO
(sardonically)
He made it And he can talk about

love

He turns back into the room Vivian has risen she stands
by a table lighting a cigarette with a wooden match from a
box which she retains in her left hand

INSERT MATCH BOX IN VIVIANS HANDS
An ordinary small box of matches The cover has been

pushed almost shut leaving the head of one match
protruding

Vivian holds the flaming match with which she has just
lighted her cigarette to the uncovered match head
igniting it

INT MARS HIDEOUT - THE LIVING ROOM

As Vivian blows out the first match and drops it casually
into an ash tray shielding the box in her hand from
Caninos view Canino strolls back looking Marlowe over
with sadistic humor

CANINO
I dont really mind the boss leaving
I can have a lot more fun alone

INSERT MATCH BOX IN VIVIANS HAND

The match has burned back charring the paper cover Smoke
rises from the box

INT MARS HIDEOUT - THE LIVING ROOM

VIVIAN

CANINO
(looking around grinning)
Save your breath baby --

The match box bursts into flame Vivian hurls it into
Caninos face then turns aside clutching her scorched
fingers

VIVIAN
(over above action)
Phil
Marlowe throws himself forward into Caninos legs -- they

roll struggling
CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE AND CANINO

as Canino comes out on top of Marlowe at an angle and
whips his pistol down at Marlowes head Marlowe wrenches
aside -- the gun barrel misses by a fraction smacking hard
on the carpet Marlowe doubles his knees into his chest
and lets go with his feet getting both heels under
Caninos jaw Canino goes backward and down dropping his
gun but hes not clear out -- the blow was glancing He
grabs Vivian as she tries to get by him pulling her down
Marlowe manages to get the gun in his shackled hands
Canino pulls another fires at him misses tangled up with
Vivian Marlowe makes it out the door

EXT MARS HIDEOUT - AT THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT (RAIN)

As Marlowe comes out and runs down the steps toward
Caninos car Over by the garage Art Huck stands scared
but undecided Marlowe snaps a shot at him Huck makes up
his mind in a hurry He vanishes -- a second later we HEAR
a car start and race off down the highway os Marlowe
working fast but awkwardly because of the handcuffs opens
the door of Caninos car backs in

INT CANINOS CAR - NIGHT (RAIN) - MARLOWE

fumbling for the ignition key and starter button behind
him He starts the motor then slides out again quickly
hugging the ground by the rear wheels offside

EXT MARS HIDEOUT - MARLOWES ANGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)

As a darkened window goes up THREE SHOTS are fired from
it We HEAR the whine of the bullets their impact on the
coupe Marlowe cries out as though hit Then again there
is silence except for the beating rain and the purring
motor

Presently the house door opens -- there is no light behind
it Vivian appears walking stiffly and behind her is
Canino shielded from possible fire They walk slowly
toward Marlowe and the car

CANINO
Can you see anything

VIVIAN
(tonelessly)
Nothing The windows are all

misted

They come steadily closer to the dark car Suddenly Vivian
stops rigid and lets go a thin tearing scream

VIVIAN
Behind the wheel
(as though pleading
with Marlowe not
to fire)
Phil

Canino shoves her roughly aside dropping to one knee and
pours three SHOTS through the car window His gun is now
empty No shots answer him -- he is satisfied that Marlowe
is dead He rises moving to open the car door as Marlowe
emerges from behind the car

MARLOWE
Finished

Canino whirls around and Marlowe the gun pressed
awkwardly against his side puts four bullets in him He
collapses into the mud and stays there

MARLOWE
(to Vivian)
Get the keys honey

Vivian white-faced and silent gets the keys from Caninos
pocket and unlocks the handcuffs Marlowe rubs his wrists
-- they look at each other both tired and drained of
emotion -- there seems to be nothing to say

MARLOWE
(quietly)
You played that hand all right
Countess

VIVIAN
(dully)
I dont know why I cared

She turns and walks away from him toward the garage and her
car not looking back Presently Marlowe goes back into
the house

FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT STERNWOOD HALL - MORNING - NORRIS AND MARLOWE

As Norris stands in the open door in the act of admitting
Marlowe

MARLOWE
The General sent for me

NORRIS
Yes sir Hes waiting in the
orchid house

Marlowe enters walking along the hall toward the rear with
Norris Subtly Norris has the air of a guard Marlowe
looks tired and somber the marks of last nights encounter
still plain on his face He has obviously not been home
he wears the same rumpled suit no tie and he has not
shaved Vivian comes out of an adjoining room as though
she has been waiting and stops them

VIVIAN
Id like to see you Mr Marlowe

She gives Norris the nod -- he goes away and Marlowe
follows Vivian into the room closing the door

INT SMALL SITTING ROOM - MARLOWE AND VIVIAN

Lavishly furnished Vivian also looks exhausted stony
but giving an impression of submerged but volcanic emotion
She does not look at Marlowe

VIVIAN
Well

MARLOWE
I kept you out of it I tolda
straight story and Canino left his
thumbprint on Harry Jones door to
back me up I dont know whether
they believed me but theres nothing
they can do about it Im clear --
self defense And all Eddie Mars has
to say is that Canino was roughing me
on his own time

VIVIAN
(looking at him
now forced to
admire him)
It wasnt as easy as you make it
sound

MARLOWE
(shrugging)
My neck is usually stuck out one
way or another Its a little
tougher than the Generals thats
all

VIVIAN
(after an uncomfortable
pause)
Its too bad Father cant know what
youve done for him Im afraid
hes angry with you

MARLOWE
Why not Everybody else is

VIVIAN
You -- wont say anything to him

MARLOWE
Of course not
VIVIAN
Phil
MARLOWE
(brutally)
Listen Im tired I killeda
man last night I stink of cops

and Ive still got a rotten taste in
my mouth I want a hot bath with
strong soap and I cant have it
until Ive seen your father Do you
mind if I go now

VIVIAN
(going close to him)
Phil -- I didnt kill Shawn Regan
MARLOWE

(cold deadpan)
Is he dead

Vivian stares at him getting a slow deadly look in her
eyes

VIVIAN

(very calmly)
Its quite possible Hes been
gone a long time and hes not a
peaceful man

(turning away)
Ill send you my personal check in
the morning Mr Marlowe

MARLOWE
Your personal check

VIVIAN
Im sure my father would wish you
to be repaid for your extra

services last night

MARLOWE
(quietly after pause)
Im sure your father would know
better and I know you do --
What about Eddie Mars

VIVIAN
What about him

MARLOWE
You think hes going to forget
all this

VIVIAN

Im tired too Get out Marlowe

Marlowe shrugs goes toward the door He speaks over his
shoulder with an air of casual politeness

MARLOWE
Hows Carmen

Vivian her back to him takes the question just a little
too easily

VIVIAN
Shes fine She went up to
Santa Barbara last night

MARLOWE
That ought to be nice for her

VIVIAN
Yes

There seems to be nothing more to say Marlowe exits
DISSOLVE TO
INT STERNWOOD REAR GARDEN - DAY - MARLOWE AND NORRIS

as they walk down the path toward the orchid house

Marlowe glances around apparently looking for something he
doesnt see Norris opens the door permitting Marlowe to
pass him into the greenhouse

INT ORCHID HOUSE - MARLOWE

As he follows the path between the banks of orchids to the
place where General Sternwood sits as before -- in the
wheelchair wrapped in robe and blanket -- only his eyes
are alive proud and piercing

STERNWOOD
Sit down Mr Marlowe

Marlowe pulls up a chair already beginning to suffer with
the heat He starts to remove his coat then something in
Sternwoods attitude makes him change his mind

STERNWOOD
I didnt ask you to look for
Shawn Regan
MARLOWE
You wanted me to though

STERNWOOD

You assume a great deal I usually
ask for what I want

(as Marlowe does

not answer)
The money I paid you is of no
consequence I merely feel that
you have no doubt unintentionally
betrayed a trust

MARLOWE

Is that all you wanted to see me about
STERNWOOD

Youre angry at that remark
MARLOWE

You have an advantage over me

General Its an advantage I

wouldnt want to take away from you
You can say anything you like to me
and I wouldnt think of getting
angry Id like to offer you your
money back It may mean nothing to
you It might mean something to me

STERNWOOD
What does it mean to you

MARLOWE
It means Ive refused payment for an
unsatisfactory job Thats all

STERNWOOD
(after a pause)
Why did you go to Captain Gregory

MARLOWE
I suppose I played a hunch I
was convinced you put those Geiger
notes up to me chiefly as a test and
that you were a little afraid Regan
might somehow be involved in an
attempt to blackmail you Besides
as I said -- I knew Regan It meant
something to me to find out too

STERNWOOD
And you allowed Captain Gregory to
think I had employed you to find
Shawn

MARLOWE
Yeah I guess I did -- when I was
sure he had the case

STERNWOOD

And do you consider that ethical
MARLOWE

Yes I do
STERNWOOD

Perhaps I dont understand

MARLOWE
Maybe you dont When you hire a
boy in my line of work it isnt like
hiring a window-washer and showing
him eight windows and saying Wash
those windows and youre through
You dont know what I have to go
through or over or under to do your
job for you I do it my way I do
my best to protect you and I may
have to break a few rules but I
break them in your favor -- After
all you didnt tell me NOT to go to
Captain Gregory

STERNWOOD
(with a faint smile)
That would have been rather difficult

MARLOWE
Well what have I done wrong Your
man Norris seemed to think the case
was over when Geiger was eliminated
I dont see it that way Im not
Sherlock Holmes I dont expect to
go over ground the police have
covered and pick up a broken
penpoint and build a case from it
If you think theres anybody in the
detective business making a living
doing that sort of thing you dont
know much about cops If they
overlook anything its something
much looser and vaguer like a man
of Geigers type sending you his
evidence of debt and asking you to
pay like a gentleman That isnt
normal Why did he do that
Because he wanted to find out if
there was anything putting pressure

(MORE )

MARLOWE (CONTD)

on you If there was youd pay
him If not youd ignore him and
wait But something was putting
pressure on you Regan You were
afraid hed stayed around and been
nice to you just long enough to find
out how to play games with your bank
account

(interrupting Sternwood

as he starts to speak)
Even at that it wasnt your money
you cared about It wasnt even
your daughters Youve more or less
written them off Its that youre
still too proud to be played for a
sucker -- and you really liked Shawn
Regan

STERNWOOD
(quietly after
a pause)
You think entirely too much Marlowe
-- Are you still trying to solve
that puzzle

MARLOWE
No Ive been warned to quit The
boys at the City Hall think I play too
rough Thats why I thought I should
give you your money back -- because it
isnt a completed job by my standards

STERNWOOD

(smiling)
Quit nothing Ill pay you another
thousand to find Shawn Regan He
doesnt have to come back I dont
even have to know where he is A
man has a right to live his own
life And he must have had his
reasons for running off like that
I only want to know that hes all
right I want to know it from him
directly and if he should happen to
need money I should want him to
have that also Am I clear

MARLOWE
Yes General

Sternwood leans back in the chair his eyes closed wearily

STERNWOOD
(trying to smile)
I guess Im a sentimental old goat
and no soldier at all Find him for
me Marlowe Just find him

MARLOWE
(rising)
Ill try Youd better rest now
Ive talked your arm off

He starts away Sternwoods voice stops him

STERNWOOD
(quietly)
You have a lot that Shawn had
Strength -- and a steady eye

Marlowe stands a moment remembering Vivians words Then
he turns quietly and goes away

GREENHOUSE DOOR - MARLOWE

as he emerges mopping again finds Norris waiting for him
already holding Marlowes hat for him Marlowe surprised
at this is still further surprised when he looks up and
sees his car which he left in front of the house now in
the drive not far away and already turned so that it is
headed back toward town

NORRIS
I took the liberty of turning it
around for you sir Since you were
in the greenhouse I brought it on
around here at the same time

MARLOWE
(ironically)
So that now I wont lose hardly any
time getting back to work huh

NORRIS
(impenetrable)
You will always be welcome here sir
if only to receive our gratitude

MARLOWE
(stuffs handkerchief
into pocket takes
his hat turns)
Thanks

He walks toward the car But still Norris walks beside
him Marlowe already realizing that he is being

practically frog-walked off the place

They reach the car

Norris steps ahead opens the door holds it open for

Marlowe to get in

MARLOWE

You dont even need a gun do you

NORRIS

Ive never had occasion for one sir

I dont think I ever will

MARLOWE
Neither do I

(nods toward greenhouse)

What do you think of him this morning

NORRIS
Hes stronger than he looks As
you would see for yourself if
occasion arose -- which thanks to
you it will not now
MARLOWE
Yeah -- what did Regan have that got
to the General so
NORRIS
Youth sir And the soldiers eye
MARLOWE
Like yours
NORRIS

Thank you sir And yours

MARLOWE
Thanks
(he starts to get
into the car Norris
still holding
the door)

So Miss Carmen went to Santa Barbara

NORRIS
Yes This morning

MARLOWE

(getting into car stops)

Mrs Rutledge told me she went last

night

NORRIS
(smoothly )
It was near midnight sir I
thought it was later I was
probably wrong

MARLOWE
I see

He gets in Norris shuts the door Marlowe starts the
engine puts car in gear

MARLOWE
If the General has any more trouble
you know how to call

NORRIS
And whom to call Thank you
again

Marlowe drives on In the mirror he can see Norris
standing in the drive still watching him guarding the
house which Marlowe realizes he is not to enter again

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARLOWES APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Marlowe has just entered He kicks the door shut crosses
the living room shedding his hat and suit coat on the
floor as he passes

INT MARLOWE APARTMENT - BEDROOM

as Marlowe continues on his way to the bath still peeling
He vanishes into the bath -- we HEAR the shower turned on
In the bedroom the PHONE RINGS Marlowe returns picks up
the phone

MARLOWE
Yeah

The voice of Eddie Mars comes clearly from the instrument

MARS VOICE
Hello soldier

MARLOWE
Hello Eddie I been waiting to
hear from you

The receiver clicks

slowly

MARS VOICE
Got a little news for you soldier
Im skipping the manicures till I
finish up this job

MARLOWE
Yeah I kind of thought you would
I got a TL for you too Eddie
Sternwood offered me a thousand

bucks to find Shawn Regan I took it

MARS VOICE
(softly after a pause)
Maybe I can help you earn that
grand You remember that stuff that
Joe Brody moved out of Geigers back
room

MARLOWE
Yeah

MARS VOICE
Well I tracked it down where Joe
stashed it and moved it back up to
Geigers place after the cops got
through You might take a look at
it

MARLOWE
Yeah -- I might

MARS VOICE
(laughing softly)
After last night Im beginning to
think youre as tough as you look
I told you we could do business
together So long soldier

MARLOWE
Be seeing you

dropping his shirt in the doorway

Marlowe sets his instrument down
looks at it a moment then returns to the shower

DISSOLVE TO

INT MARLOWES APARTMENT - BEDROOM

as Marlowe comes out of the bath buttoning his pajama
He is freshly shaved his hair still damp and
He pulls down the shades putting

coat

rumpled from the shower

out the daylight and collapses into the bed

Just as he is comfortably settled already half asleep the
doorbell RINGS It rings insistently with a quality of
nervous urgency Marlowe finally gets up to answer it
pulling on a dressing gown

INT MARLOWES APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

as Marlowe admits Vivian She is obviously in a fine state

of nerves She enters quickly -- he shuts the door
VIVIAN
Phil
MARLOWE

All right now what

VIVIAN
Eddie Mars just called me Hes
out to get you

MARLOWE

We knew that a long time ago
VIVIAN

But now you must believe it You

must get out of town -- now
MARLOWE

You better sit down baby and
catch your breath

He sits down on the davenport

VIVIAN
Phil how do you feel about me

MARLOWE
Just like I feel about a stick of
dynamite Smooth on the outside --
but it makes a mess when it goes off

VIVIAN
I got a different idea last night
Or maybe youre not a man except
when two or three people are trying
to murder you

They kiss -- one of those kisses Vivian frees herself
VIVIAN
Now go At once Ill give you
money -- a thousand -- five thousand

if youll get out of town now --
today
MARLOWE
That would be stage money I like
to earn my money I cant earn that
much at one time but what I do earn
doesnt smell bad to me

VIVIAN
Would you get out of town if you
knew Shawn Regan was dead

MARLOWE
Is Shawn Regan dead

VIVIAN
Would you

MARLOWE
How did he die

VIVIAN

Kiss me
MARLOWE

Later -- maybe How did Shawn die
VIVIAN

I killed him By accident He was
teaching me to shoot and the gun
went off

MARLOWE
And thats what Eddie Mars has got
on you And so he sent you here
to buy me off with you

Vivian stares at him slaps him viciously across the
Marlowe takes it

She slaps

MARLOWE
Will you have the kiss now too

him again He takes it

MARLOWE
Youre good youre very good but
you cant do it baby It wont wash

VIVIAN
You fool I killed him I tell you
Just as youre going to be dead if
you dont get out of town Dont
you see Eddie Mars cant let you
stay alive now

face

MARLOWE
Eddie never developed that trouble
this morning Now Ill ask you one
whats your game with me

VIVIAN
Theres no game -- with you
MARLOWE
Youve been playing spin the bottle
with me ever since I met you Its

please Phil one minute and ‘get
out Marlowe the next You havent
told me a straight truth since the
first day

VIVIAN
Thats a lie Im trying to play
straight now You fool dont you
realize youre going to die if you
stay here

MARLOWE
No All youve told me is that you
want me out of town at any price --
and that you still believe I can be
bought if you can just find the
right currency Sure Ima fool I
try to do my job and keep my nose
clean I risk my whole future the
hatred of the cops and Eddie Mars
gang I dodge bullets and eat saps
But Im not supposed to feel
anything about it either way
because anybody can buy my immortal
soul with a few bucks -- or maybe
just a kiss Sure Ima fool

She stares at him her eyes blazing Suddenly she raises
her hand but before she can slap him he speaks and she
pauses

MARLOWE
Thats right Have another I
throw them in free to old clients

She stops stares at him suddenly takes his face between
her hands stares at him

VIVIAN
Youre going to find Shawn Regan

MARLOWE
Yeah

VIVIAN
No matter who gets hurt

MARLOWE
No matter who gets hurt

VIVIAN
(letting her hands
drop to his shoulders)
All right Phil Its funny -- I
think I really like you now for
the first time

She turns to the door her head high her voice very cool
and steady Only her eyes hidden from Marlowe tell how
she feels

VIVIAN
Goodbye Phil

She goes out
DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOBART ARMS - AT FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

as Marlowe comes out wearing a hat and trench-coat against
the rain which has begun to fall He gets into his car and
drives off As he does so a second car a dark convertible
seen indistinctly in the shadowy street swings around the
corner behind him slows falters then picks up speed
following Marlowe

EXT LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)

as Marlowe drives slowly cautiously toward Geigers house
The street is dark deserted Marlowe drives without
lights He stops in the tree-shadows by the angle of
Geigers hedge and slides quietly out of the car keeping
close to the hedge His gum gleams faintly in his hand

EXT LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)

A section of the road over which Marlowe has just come
The dark convertible creeps along in the shadows also
without lights It is still impossible to see who is
driving

EXT GEIGERS PLACE - NIGHT (RAIN)

as Marlowe makes his way like a stalking cat through the
garden toward the front door Nothing stirs There is no
sound but the rain Marlowe crosses the exposed bridge at
a crouching run

Nothing happens He pauses in the shadows by the front door
then tries the knob Silently the door swings open He
waits then darts swiftly inside

EXT LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)

The dark convertible still shrouded in the heavy shadows
of the trees parks quietly behind Marlowes car across the
road

INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Marlowe stands beside the door which he has closed
listening He is only a shadow among shadows The house
is utterly still Marlowe still cautious crosses into
the rear part of the house then returns

MARLOWE
(laughing softly)
Okay Eddie I get it -- on the
way out

He draws the heavy curtains quickly across the windows
turns on the lights and sheds his hat and coat The
packing box from Geigers back room stands on the hearth-
rug Marlowe bends over to look inside

INSERT THE PACKING BOX

filled with manila filing envelopes ledgers etc On the
top of the stack is a folder labeled Sternwood It has
obviously been placed there on purpose

INT GEIGERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Marlowe picks up the folder -- a KNOCK SOUNDS on the front
door Marlowe reacts dropping the folder and raises his
gun He moves quickly to turn out the lights then stands
beside the door flat against the wall

MARLOWE
Yeah

CARMENS VOICE
Phil -- let me in

MARLOWE
(after a pause
unlocking the door)
Come in fast and shut the door behind
you

He retains his wary position while Carmen obeys When he
is sure shes alone he sighs relocks the door and turns
on the lights His face is beaded with sweat his hand
shaking slightly Carmen is lightly clad without hat or
coat Apparently she has left home in a hurry

CARMEN
Did I scare you

MARLOWE
(dryly)
No -- I was expecting visitors
I thought you were in Santa
Barbara

CARMEN
They had me locked in my room
They even had my clothes locked
up But I climbed down the drain
pipe I had to see you again

MARLOWE
Why did you come here

CARMEN
You were just driving away when I
got to your place I followed
She is obviously wrought up in a highly emotional state

MARLOWE
It must have been important

CARMEN
It was Phil I -- Im sorry about
the other night

MARLOWE
Forget it

CARMEN
I cant Phil you I dont know
quite how to say this have you

ever seen something perhaps in a
dream Something perfect and
beautiful a long way off and you
try to reach it but there are too
many things in your way

MARLOWE
Yeah I know what you mean

CARMEN
Maybe if everything had been
different -- if I hadnt been born a

Sternwood if my mother had lived --
if Id known a man like you before
Oh Phil is there ever any way back

MARLOWE
That depends

CARMEN
(softly intensely serious)
You could help me find the way

He looks at her saying nothing She comes closer to him
childlike pleading

CARMEN
Phil youve got to help me Im
getting lost I dont know where
Im going any more and Im scared

MARLOWE
Why me Carmen
CARMEN
Because Just because you came

into the house and I saw you Just
a little thing like that Dont you
understand Phil Youve got
something I need some thing Ive
got to have Strength maybe I
dont know But Ive got to have
it or -- I dont know whats going
to happen to me

She puts her hands on his chest looking up into his
face For once shes completely honest

MARLOWE
(quietly)
Was that what you wanted from
Shawn Regan

She draws away from him very slowly her eyes changing
hardening becoming wary

CARMEN
Perhaps Phil

MARLOWE
(gently)
Im sorry Carmen Thats how it
goes People have to find their
own way -- wherever theyre going
You can if you really want to

He turns away to let Carmen have that moment to herself

MARLOWE
(after a pause)
Before you go I have something

that belongs to you

CARMEN
(dully)
What

MARLOWE
Your gun Ive been carrying it
around thinking Id see you

He hands her the little gun out of his coat pocket

MARLOWE
Careful of it now Its cleaned
and loaded in all five

CARMEN
(taking the gun)
Thanks

Marlowe moves past her as though to open the door

CARMEN
Turn around

He does so -- she has the gun leveled and theres no doubt
what shes going to do with it

MARLOWE
Carmen

CARMEN

Its Vivian isnt it
MARLOWE

That has nothing to do

CARMEN
It was Vivian with Shawn too Its
always Vivian

She fires point blank as Marlowe takes a step toward her
continues to fire four shots in all Then she waits until
he has almost reached her and thrusts the pistol almost
into his face He catches her wrist just before she fires
pushes her hand aside as the shot goes off She snatches
her hand free steps back hurls the pistol at his chest
It falls to the ground He stoops and picks it up

MARLOWE
So thats the way it was with Shawn

CARMEN
(dazedly)
But he died why didnt you

MARLOWE
I blanked the shells

CARMEN
(still stunned breathless)
You knew I -- You knew --

MARLOWE
I sort of figured it that way And
Id like it better if Shawn had
taken it in the back after all from
Eddie Mars -- He was teaching you
to shoot wasnt he Thats what he
thought he was doing Only you
didnt fire at the target

CARMEN
(with half-dreamy
vindictiveness)
No -- they put him in the sump --
down where the old wells are
MARLOWE
Couldnt you have found a cleaner
place
CARMEN

He didnt mind

MARLOWE
No I suppose oil and water are
the same as wind and air when youre
dead So Vivian paid Eddie Mars
and covered up for you

CARMEN
Yes Youd like to do something
about it wouldnt you But you
cant Im always safe

MARLOWE
How do you figure that

CARMEN
Because Vivian wont let you And
you wont do it anyhow You like
my father just as Shawn did You
know what would happen if you took
me into court Pictures and long
columns in the newspapers and the
Sternwood name all over the
headlines You know what that would
do to father

A pause She is looking at him like a wicked changeling

CARMEN
And Vivians in on this too Way
in You wouldnt want to see her
go to prison

MARLOWE
No I wouldnt want that And
the old man I wouldnt want to
kill him -- for you

His attitude is one of defeat Carmen is pleased
triumphant Marlowe turns away dejectedly picks up his
hat and coat

MARLOWE
(not looking at her)
Better take these Carmen its
raining

CARMEN
Thanks

She puts them on quickly then stands looking at Marlowe

CARMEN
I think Im glad I didnt kill you
This is going to eat you Youre
going to lie awake nights thinking
about it And every so often youll
see me somewhere and Ill laugh at
you Goodbye Phil

She turns quickly toward door Marlowe steps quickly to
the light switch As she opens the door and steps through
it he snaps off the light There is a brief pause -- then
gun fire

EXT GEIGERS HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR

as Carmen crumples silently onto the doorstep There is
silence The door swings open Presently from the dark
shrubbery Eddie Mars comes walking slowly toward the
silent shape His gun is in his hand He crosses the
footbridge and moves the dead head with his foot

Marlowe snaps the switch inside the door light floods
suddenly out over Mars Marlowe stands in the door facing
Mars across Carmens body as Mars reacts

MARLOWE
You were a little too quick on the
trigger that time too Eddie

His voice seems to break the spell Mars goes for his gun
starts to raise it but Marlowe fires first Mars drops
beside Carmen As Mars falls the SOUND of a man running
away through the garden comes OVER

Marlowe whirls snaps a shot toward the running man takes
a few quick steps but stops as the SOUND of a car starting
and roaring frantically away comes OVER Marlowe turns
toward the door

INT HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE

as he gathers up the Sternwood folder out of the box of
blackmail stuff puts it in his pocket as he turns

(to Vivian)
She was in the darkness and Mr

her -- dont you see

VIVIAN

MARLOWE
(quietly)
Yes You dont kill people for free

VIVIAN
Yes I know

MARLOWE

fifteen thousand dollars to put him
into the sump

VIVIAN
Only it was my fifteen thousand I
pawned the jewels mother left me I

find his relatives -- if he had
relatives Not that it matters I
know what you must think of me

MARLOWE
Do you -- Theres one thing
bothering me Its not the sump

Shawn wouldnt care about that now
But he was a Catholic --

VIVIAN
I had prayers said for him in the
Cathedral And I brought the Father
out here too I couldnt lie to
him He stood beside the sump and
blessed Shawn I prayed too -- for
me at least

Marlowe puts his hand under her chin tilting her head
back

MARLOWE
Youre okay soldier A little
dumber than I am but okay
(straightening up)

heart to break

NORRIS
Its Miss Carmen sir --

STERNWOOD
Yes Tell me

MARLOWE

Sternwood closes his eyes otherwise he doesnt move
Norris moves quickly and anxiously toward him but he opens
his eyes again as black and fierce as ever

STERNWOOD
Well Am I to know how

Norris hesitates in dread but Marlowe speaks smoothly

MARLOWE
It was a car crash sir She was on
her way back from Santa Barbara It
was instantaneous I dont think she
suffered at all

STERNWOOD
And will no more -- since it was a
car crash

MARLOWE

again
