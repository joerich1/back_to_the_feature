The car pulls into the driveway and suddenly stops short with a
slight SCREECH We CONTINUE DOWN

Inches from the bumper headlights glistening off of it is a
little girl’s new tricycle The Volvo’s door opens and a man
rushes through the rain to retrieve it

INT KITCHEN —- NICE SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
The man sets the tricycle down and shakes the rain off of him

His name is MICHAEL WHITTIER Early forties but still pretty
ood looking maybe a little tired around the eyes He tosses his
eys onto the counter and reaches into his coat but stops

noticing a note next to the fax machine

CU NOTE Which reads “Daddy” in crayon with the drawing of
three little stick figures obviously girls and an arrow We PAN
RIGHT The arrow points to a full glass of milk and a chocolate
chip cookie with two small bites out of it

BACK ON Mike who grins He pulls the holstered 9mm HandK from
his pants sets it on the counter and drops his Interpol badge
next to it He then takes the glass and heads into his study
INT DARK STUDY - NIGHT

Mike walks in silhouetted in the barest glow from the window We
can hear him eating the cookie He trips over something heavy

MIKE
Bloody hell

He pulls the chain on the desk light and looks down the cookie in
his mouth A blanket covering a large lump is on the floor

MIKE (CONTD)
What the fuck

He takes the cookie from his mouth and looks around confused
Suddenly he drops the glass instinctively going for his gun

MAN (0S)
It’s not there

Mike realizes it’s not almost tripping over the lump again

On the other side of the desk his desk sitting in his chair is
aman A man wearing an expensive black suit with a red tie The

man is bald

It’s in the kitchen where you left it On
the counter next to the fax machine Sit

He stops as he notices the picture in the man’s other hand The

picture of Michael’‘s wife and three girls
the desk facing Mike

AGENT 47
You have a nice family

47 sets the picture on

The Man slowly unscrews the silencer from the 45 Mike is about
to freak thinking the worst But the man shakes his head

placing the silencer on the desk as well

of the men each hold massive hyenas on thick chains which lunge

After a few moments the guard waves the others aside and the

precision buckle a well used black leather harness around the
risoner’s shoulders They then HOIST the man up and HANG the

Machete in hand Ovie moves toward the man staring up at him
The man freaks writhing about uselessly like a fish on a hook
his incomprehensible screams muffled by the gag

Tears pour from the man’s eyes as a wicked smile crosses Ovie’s
lips “He reaches out and grabs the man’s left arm extending it

from Ovie’s vice-like grip but to no avail

He holds a device in his hand with a black whip antenna protruding
from it He twists the dials on the device

There are any number of ways to kill a man

In 47s ear is a tiny receiver As he calibrates the device the
man’s muffled screaming becomes audible then gives way to Ovies

Of course It is well known Otto had
contacts with a Moscow crime syndicate We
believe this was a business disagreement

from one of the steak knives

off the table and plunges it into the impatient guard’s neck
several times while his other hand yanks the guard’s Glock from
his shoulder holster

The booming music slightly obscures the noise as 47 turns and
executes the other guards in the room Saving Otto for last
Byes wide with fear he gets three rounds One in the body two
in the head

47 removes his waiter’s Jacket and lifts one of the shocked
leather masked slaves from the floor onto his feet

He drags the slave to the door standing to one side the Glock in
one hand his other arm around the slaves neck

Three guards run into the room weapons out 47 drops them He
waits a moment holding out the weapon and pops the fourth guy
the one with the wand who sticks his head in the door

trying to reason through their drugged haze what the fuck is
happening

stampede from the room The Glock its last shell spent locks

party The man seems detached A woman appears smiles at the
man and takes the boy with a wink As she leaves the mans smile
fades the detachment returning

dispel the gloom of this place

47 sits at the desk his laptop open a camera cabled to it as is
the little projector which shows a map of the city on one of the
walls In the middle of the map a tiny red circle is drawn

More concentric circles ring the maps each denoting distance 500
meters 1000 meters 2500 meters 000 meters etc

47 moves the cursor to a building atthe edge of the map almost
three miles and CLICKS The digital cameras hard-drive spins
and the building appears « It is very tall but currently under
construction Little more than superstructure and floors

He CLICKS again We now see the view from one of the top floors
Far below in the distance we can just make a restaurant

47 looks at it a moment then moves to the bed Where a Barrett
-50 Cal Sniper rifle sits He begins to disassemble the weapon
We PAN back to the photo We PUSH IN The scan-lines DISAPPEAR

47 looks at the two pieces of luggage He sighs

He reaches into his bag takes out a thermite grenade pulls the
pin and places it in one of the ungodly-expensive rolling bags

With another sigh he flings the bag off the train It flies
toward the river below flaring white briefly as it breaks the
surface of the water

47 feels the train begin to decelerate as it approaches the city
in accordance with Federal regulations He hefts his remaining
suitcase and begins to run toward the rear of his train

Approaching from the other direction another train leaves the
city’s “SLOW ZONE” and begins to pick up speed

As it passes 47 leaps across the distance between the two
landing deftly on the other train’s roof

EXT ROOF — BULLET TRAIN 2 - NIGHT

He now must run in the opposite direction to keep from skipping
off like a stone The rear of the train quickly approaches

At the end of the last car 47 slides off the edge onto the

is remaining suitcase which goes over the rail handle extending

He stands there a moment the other train disappearing in the

standing on the corner Her name is Ekaterina Sytrovski but goes
by the familiarized NIKA

Just this side of eighteen her long blonde hair is dyed bright
pink at the tips She has the tattoo of a tiny dragon on her left
cheekbone about the size of a dime and her lip is pierced

None of this detracts from her beauty She is stunning And she
doesn’t look like a common prostitute wearing one of those
expensive designer work-out suits this one in pink with the Logo
on the ass Nor does she look particularly frightened More like
annoyed

ANGLE ON 47 who moves calmly toward her nonchalantly reaching
into his coat

INSIDE HIS COAT is his stainless 45 silencer attached

BACK ON THE GIRL who looks up and down the street A suited man
checks her out as he passes She lifts her middle finger at him
with a smile The man moves on

47 takes this in as he approaches thumbing off the 45s safety

She must feel him coming because she turns and glances at him
They lock eyes but oddly she doesn’t run In fact she isn’t
apprehensive at all She just looks at him quizzically

She doesn’t recognize him No clue who he is Quickly realizing
something is wrong 47 rapidly steps right

WHOOSH A silenced sniper round misses him by inches Tearing
through the air where his head should be FWACK the bullet hits
a bystander

fur-lined black full-length coat He is reading all the
articles on Belicoff

“Belicoff Hard-line Stance Anti American” “Mikhail Belicoff
gaining support with Russias Working class” “Belicoff£
softening his Hard-line View” Then another about his crazy

brother” “Udre Belicoff arrested for murder in Minsk Political
trouble for his older Brother”

With his other hand he is drawing on a torn out magazine ad with
a red pen The ad is a CU of a beautiful model With the pen he
has transformed the picture into a damn good likeness of the girl
Nika It seems as if he is doing both things simultaneously

47 logs onto a Forum WO0F Women Outraged Over Fur A
message box opens “Account Terminated Due to Technical Problems
Do Not Attempt to Reconnect” Then “You are on your own 47”

He stares at the screen He then logs ontoa Secure Mail Server
aypes an email address then “Need to call ina favor Urgent
Will come to you 47” Hits send

He glances over at the picture he’s been working on But looks up
as Swishy Salesman and another similarly dressed YOUNG MAN enter
the cafe moving to him

SWISHY SALESMAN

Louboutin boutique They sell very
expensive shoes

INT CAFE’ — SWANKY HOTEL - NIGHT

To call this place a cafe is someones idea of humor It’s like
calling the Burj Dubai a building

Yuri sits slurping down oysters He pours Mike another shot of
300 dollar a bottle vodka

MIKE
Youre expense account must be larger than
mine
Yuri smiles
YURI

The assassin you are looking for My
associates tell me you believe him to be
freelance

MIKE
I know he is If you follow the pattern of
kills across Europe the only pattern is
there is no pattern Except the efficiency
of the work

YURI

So you do not believe he is connected with
the American Central Intelligence Agency

MIKE
No There is nothing to suggest that Why
do you ask

YURI

No reason It just seems to be a bit
naive
MIKE
(Smiles)

You think so

YURI
Please I am not trying to offend you You
are a very capable police officer But
that is what you are A cop A rock is
tossed through a window you look for the
perpetrator You tryto reason a motive
i however am paid to look under that rock

(MORE)
YURI (CONTD)
To determine what chain of events would be
triggered by it breaking that window and
who would ultimately benefit globally

MIKE
What are you suggesting

YURI
Merely that you are a very good
syshchik Detective Isnt it odd that
after three years you have been unable to
even put a face with your assassin beyond
a vague description “Internally you even
refer to this man as a ghost

Mike looks at him

YURI (CONTD)
Perhaps it is not a single man you are
looking for But a well financed
intelligence organization working for a
singular cause The CIA for example

MIKE
The CIA no longer has that kind of power
YURI

And the KGB no longer exists Yet here I
sit

Mike thinks a moment

Yuri smiles

MIKE
Well it is a theory

YURI
Yes A theory But a theory shared by
Moscow In accordance with Article 17643
of the EU Charter any state matters which
deal directly with intelligence shall be
the sole jurisdiction of the host country

MIKE
Abh And the light bulb comes on Took me
a minute Must be the jet-lag
(Beat)
Youre telling us to leave

YURI
No of course not You are a good man
Michael enjoy the sights of Russia But
leave the intelligence work and this
assassin to the FSB

MIKE
Who informed you of the whereabouts of my
guy
slurping down another oyster Mike nods

MIKE (CONT’D)
Okay heres an easy one Who is Belicoff

44

YURI
I’m sorry

He tosses Yuri a picture It is a hard copy of the frame from the
shooting

MIKE
Two things are wrong with that picture
One that Footage has been tampered with
Someone inserted that civilian to cover up
what actually happened What is it you’re
trying to cover up

YURI
(Pouring a vodka)
And the second thing

MIKE
My boy doesn’t miss

YURI
gStams the shot)
As I said you are a very good policeman
Michael Try the oysters They are
lovely

‘ Yuri rises to leave

MIKE
Is the FSB trying to cover-up some sick PR
stunt to stir up support and raise Belicoff
in the polls saw the speech Is that
why you’re trying to get rid of us You
don’t want us to find the sniper

Yuri grins putting on his coat

YURI
Well the failed assassination has
definitely elevated Belicoff politically
(Beat)
I’m trying to protect you Michael

Mike looks at the two other Russian FSB agents who resemble
Gestapo lounging at the periphery

MIKE
Is that a threat Is the FSB threatening a
senior Interpol detective

YURI
(Chuckles )
Please thank Interpol for such a fine if
expensive meal And enjoy the vodka you
paid enough for it

He motions to his men who follow him out Jenkins walks over and
gives Mike the pack of cigarettes Mike opens it Lights one
He glances at the untouched feast as Jenkins turns to leave

MIKE
Jenkins Tell Clarkson to get down here
No reason for this expensive dinner to go
to waste You enjoy it

Mike walks away

He then shakes his head doesn’t matter

She shrugs

AGENT 47 (CONT ’D)

NIKA

Mikhail‘s brother I don’t know

(She looks at 47)
Mikhail and Udre dont speak much Mikhail
called him Mudak A fuck-up Had him

AGENT 47 (CONT’D)
A 22 caliber Makarov with an integral
silencer Used to be a favored weapon with
the KGB Not much use for protection but
exceptionally good for killing especially
if you aim for the soft spots like your
eye Your driver was going to use it on
you

NIKA
(Staring at him)
Why are you helping me

AGENT 47
Youre my only connection to Belicoff And
because I need to get out of St Petersburg

cooked meat with a butcher knife to

and fur hat of a Provodnik He casual y turns his hand inside
his jacket to position the small raised dimple beneath his other
arm The only evidence of the silencer pressed against it

doubles over dropping to the ground

lun in the Clown‘s hand silenced but un-fired The Militsioner
ifts his weapon as the Clown shoots him

fires at the more immediate threat Two Russian cops He turns
as they fall and he runs

ANGLE ON 47 who lowers the weapon inside his coat He watches
the Clown a moment then looks at the station map in his hand

47 moves quickly between the columns past the food vendor ducking
behind his cart the knife forgotten on the cutting board

The Clown sprints across the terminal shooting another
Militsioner He ducks into a side passage Automatic fire from
the cops drop several of the passengers

ANGLE ON MIKE who runs to the fallen coated man He turns him
over Clarkson at his side

The man in the coat is the beggar from outside Nika’s Apartment

Clown’s chin We see the Clown’s eyes through the holes in the
mask

The Clown is silent 47 thinks about shooting him again Instead
he peels up the mask

The two men look at each other a moment then the man spits
something at him 47 moves the thing missing him 47 looks at
the ground He realizes the man just bit out his own tongue

ANGLE ON 47 drops the man to the ground The man smiles at him
‘ blood pouring from his mouth and pulls the Clown mask back down

wall of the train and places his finger to her lips He turns
his back to the metal Waiting

falls gasping for air

47 stares at Nika a split second then walks over to Mike taking
the HandK All Mike can do is try to breathe

AGENT 47
She just saved your life

47 bends down to him thinking staring into Mike’s eyes

AGENT 47 (CONTD)
You‘re the one who’s been tracking me
Youre smart You almost had me Maybe
next time

Mike doesn’t understand why 47 doesn’t kill him But he doesn’t

47 moves back to the Clown who stares at him through the train’s
open door 47 is not happy

Nika starts to say something but 47 holds up his finger pissed
She decides not speaking is an excellent idea

AGENT 47 (CONT’D)
Take off your coat

NIKA
What

AGENT 47
Take off your coat

He turns her so he can pull off her coat As she faces the other
direction 47 fires three silenced shots up the train steps into
the clown’s head

Nika turns to look at him as the shell casings BOUNCE and ROLL
down to her feet She looks at them confused

AGENT 47 (CONTD)
Lets go Now

She hugs herself cold in an outfit more skin than dress Not
moving 47 grabs her by the hand and yanks her along behind him

EXT DESERTED PLATFORM - MORNING

Three FSB thugs stand there looking around with silenced HK UMP’s
raised 47 dressed in the Provodnik uniform steps out dragging
e girl

FSB THUG 3
Stop Your papers

47 doesnt run instead drags the girl directly to them yelling
at her in Russian Then

AGENT 47
She has no ticket

The three Thugs now stare at her She is hot and not wearing
much They smile at each other lowering their weapons

AGENT 47 (CONTD)
She tried to sneak onto a train
Freeloader

FSB THUG 3
Well handle her from here

AGENT 47
Very well

He slings her roughly to them or’into them actually

FSB THUG 3
Easy --

-- but we never hear what else he has to say 47 has the vender’s
butcher knife in his hand and drives it under the chin of FSB Thug
3 He steps back half a step as his other hand WHIPS out the 45

LONG SHOT as 47 fires two silenced shots into the face of each of
the other two their weapons never even coming back up The three
bodies fall

ANGLE ON THE GIRL’s blood splattered face She screams

AGENT 47
Be quiet

47 snatches the blade from the falling man before he even hits the
ground He wipes it on the man’s uniform and holsters his weapon
He then takes a silenced UMP several clips and wraps them in her
coat He then grabs her hand

AGENT 47 (CONT’D)
Wipe your face

Without looking at her 47 drags Nika to the steps leading down
to the metro

NIKA
You killed those Militsiya

AGENT 47
Those men werent cops They were FSB
And for what purpose do you think they
would need suppressors on their weapons

She thinks about that as he pulls her down the steps

NIKA
Wait the trains are the other way
EXT STATION PARKING LOT - LATER

Mike sits in the back of an ambulance in pain A Russian EMT
examines the nasty black bruise that has appeared on his side

MIKE
For Gods sake Yes it hurts

The EMT says something in Russian Mike doesn’t get it

YURI (08-)
He said your ribs are broken

The EMT nods raising two fingers Mike winces as Yuri walks
over

YURI (CONTD)
Unlucky

Yuri takes out a pack of cigarettes and hands Mike one lighting
it for him Smoking hurts but doesn’t stop him

MIKE
You seem awfully calm considering

YURI
(Smiles shrugs)
I have reason to be calm You on the other
hand do not

MIKE
Calm You let him get away

YURI
On the contrary We apprehended your
assassin After he shot your subordinate
And you

MIKE
The clown You know that isn’t the
assassin Why are you covering this up

YURI
As I told you before Inspector this is no
longer your affair Now there are two ways
in which we may proceed

(MORE )

YURI (CONTD)
One my men will accompany you to the
hospital And when you and your
subordinate are able to travel they will
escort you to the airport Then I will
write a report extolling Interpol for it’s
help There will probably be medals
involved

Mike starts to say something But Yuri cuts him off

YURI (CONT’D)
Or I can report your incompetence and
disregard for my nation’s laws to your
superiors This will undoubtedly find its
way to the State Prosecutor in Moscow
Five men are dead today because of you
Russian men I believe it is calle
complicity

M
Complicity

YURI
Now how do you think we should proceed

Mike looks at him

MIKE
Go fuck yourself

A moment passes as Mike thinks about it and slowly grins

YURI
You are smiling

MIKE
Yeah Cause the question that you should
ask yourself is if the clown was the
assassin who is his killer But more
importantly where is he

Mike stands up looking around at the buildings surrounding them
He smiles again at Yuri claps him on the back and walks
painfully to where Clarkson waits

MIKE (CONTD)

’ She now notices the weapon he is holding in his lap She suddenly
becomes very afraid

NIKA
Are you going to kill me I swear it will -

AGENT 47
-- Stop talking

He looks down at the gun in his lap Lifts it

AGENT 47 (CONT’D)
I’ve thought a lot about it The entire
drive I know I should Right now

Staring at the gun she unconsciously braces herself against the
door Not trying to run Just waiting

AGENT 47 (CONTD)
Give me a reason not to

She thinks about it After a moment--

NIKA
I I don’t have one
(Beat then)

dream about it I’ve even tried a couple
of times

She shows him the scars on her wrists

NIKA (CONTD)
They always found me Took me to the
hospital

(MORE )
NIKA (conte)
God how I prayed for death when he punished
me for it But as it turns out I dont
have the constitution for it Youd think
killing myself wouldn’t be so hard

AGENT 47
You made your choice to do what you do

NIKA
(Sad smile)
You really don’t know I’m not a whore
by choice Belicoff owns me

He looks at her

NIKA (CONTD)
Not metaphorically He owns me I am
Mikhails property When I was fourteen
soldiers came to my village and took me I
lost my virginity o six men in the back of
a transport truck Then I was sold into
slavery Don’t look so surprised Its
common in Eastern Europe Russian Mafia
kadnap lots of young girls every year Or

Gasoline Or a bullet Don’t you watch CNN

Anyway three years ago I was sold to
Belicoff Would you like to know how much
he paid for me

AGENT 47
No
NIKA
Three hundred dollars American
He doesnt know what to say
NIKA (CONTD)
So if youre looking to me for a reason not
to kill me I don’t really have one
They stare at each other Then

NIKA (CONTD)
Are you Going to kill me

AGENT 47
No
NIKA
(Beat)

NIKA (CONTD)
You dont want to fuck me and you don’t
want to kill me I‘ve never felt so much
indifference in my entire life

(His tone hardens)
But I promise you this If you ever again

He thinks about it Then holsters the weapon

She takes his hand
NIKA

I am truly sorry Oh my god your hand

(She looks at his hand)
They‘re smooth Your heart-line is gone
You don’t even have any fingerprints

AGENT 47

He takes back his hand She doesnt know what to say to that 47
leans the seat back putting on his shades

A political bomb was dropped in Moscow
today when Russian hard-line candidate
Mikhail Belicoff accused his opponent
Vladimir Trevestky the Russian Federations
incumbent president of being behind the
failed attempt on his life several days
ago Belicoff has risen dramatically in
the polls since the attempted
assassination

(MORE)

BBC REPORTER (CONTD)
In the last six-months he had softened on
r ) his leftist Communist views but since the
shooting he has taken his most hard-line
stance to date Trevesky denies any
involvement in the attack

Back on the BBC reporter

BBC REPORTER (CONTD)
No official comment from the American State
Department But a source inside the White
House says Belicoff has surprising large
support on Capital Hill --

it’s a 127mm bullet That caliber is only
used in the VSSK Vychlop anew
particularly nasty Russian sniper rifle
integrally silenced and capable of sub-1
MOA at 1000 meters And Mike the VSSK is
only issued to special FSB anti-terrorist

had before the invasion He’s paranoid
enough

He pushes play on the tape recorder We HEAR the conversation
Yuri had with Belicoff

I might be mistaken but it sounds like you
are engaged in political maneuvering wit
an opponent of this current administration
Were that true the result for you would
be Unfortunate You must return to
Moscow immediately

YURI
General first you have no evidence that is
me And I don’t know where you got that
tape but it is irrelevant Because
secondly you have no authority over the

Yuri hangs up the cell then tosses it into the river He stares
at Mike who walks back toward the train

What do you think the chances are that our
boy is at the bottom of that river

gigantic gold dome

We CONTINUE DOWN CLOSER we see a half-dozen news trucks sat
dishes raised ready to transmit the funeral or more importantly
Belicoff’s speech to the world in real time

INT CATHEDRAL OF CHRIST THE SAVIOUR DAY

The place is standing room only with Belicoff supporters fighting
for a glimpse Soldiers in ges masks and body armor are
positioned in every conceivable place

In front of the pulpit a platoon of camera reporters are ready to
gapture every angle of Belicoffs eulogy This scene is the very
definition of media circus

WE CRANE OVER up to the top most balcony more decorative than
functional E4 kneels at the rail His VSSK Vychlop 127mm
silenced sniper rifle scans the cathedral

We continue DOWN toward the back of the cathedral Mike stands
next to General Kormarov and is not happy Behind Mike waiting
for orders is a squad of Interpol HRT guys dressed in blue SWAT
uniforms and holding automatic weapons

MIKE
I understand general But you dont know
this assassin Ive spent the last 3 years
learning how he thinks He will be here

GENERAL KORMAROV
Yes I understand your concern with this
elusive assassin My anxiety however is
much more direct -

MIKE
- General

GENERAL KORMAROV
Please I am not diminishing your
commitment Your service to the EU is
exemplary But There are almost 400
Russian soldiers in this cathedral
Spesnatz Alfa Moscow OMON

An aide walks up to the General who holds up a finger

MIKE
- General everything he has done leads
right here I’m convinced he killed Udre
Belicoff to put this in motion He has to
take Belicoff here It must be public I
know I sound paranoid But they can’t
cover this up It’ll be on every
television from Los Angeles to Kaliningrad

GENERAL KORMAROV

(Smiles)
Iam Russian Inspector not American In
this country we find paranoia to be a
virtue But please trust us to handle
this It would be foolish to attempt any
type of violence in this arena A man as
highly trained as your assassin would
realize this Now if you’ll excuse me

He walks off with the aide Jenkins and Clarkson move to him
JENKINS

He doesnt believe a word I say

MIKE
Oh no Anything happens they plan on
gassing everyone
Jenkins and Clarkson stare at Mike
JENKINS
Well you got to admire Russian efficiency

MIKE
(To himself)
He’s right it’d be suicide for our boy to
try to take Belicoff here

JENKINS
Sar

Mike thinks about it Knowing he’s missing something
Thunderous applause drowns Mike out as Belicoff strides to the

pulpit On his way the Orthodox Catholic Arch Bishop stands and
ugs him More applause

CLARKSON
This is a political rally and not a
funeral correct Tossers

Mike looks at him nods then turns his attention to Belicoff as
the bright lights hit him

From the radio on the patio table we HEAR the funeral service

And what is necessary is sometimes very
hard with the things we love We confuse
compassion with kindness

We MOVE TOWARD the man and he smiles And we now see It is
Belicoff Another one He mouths the words as the other Belicoff
says them As if he knows what the other is going to say before
he says it Because of course he does

Anger and disgust are barely evident on his face But then they
are gone He picks up the shears and moves to another potted rose
bush getting on his knees clipping

We PAN and PUSH IN TO A CU of the RADIO A hand reaches into

ANGLE ON BELICOFF He doesn’t turn around He just continues
pruning those rose bushes

BELICOFF
Seems I underestimated you

We PAN RIGHT 47 stands next to the radio

AGENT 47
Consistently

47 adjusts his jacket to cover the blood splatter from the
soldiers

BELICOFF
A miscalculation on my part

AGENT 47
So Did the hard-line Communists make
you an offer Or was killing Mikhail your
idea Mischa

Belicoff stares at 47

AGENT 47 (CONTD)
Show me your arm

BELICOFF
Why Does it matter

AGENT 47
To satisfy my own curiosity

Belicoff unties the robe He slowly lowers one side When he
does we can see the welt of scars and skin-grafts below his neck

AGENT 47 (CONT’D)
No scar on your arm

BELICOFF
(Smiles)
Mikhail could have very well returned
Russia to her former glory All the people
needed was a push to make him a hero But
he stopped short Then I realized the
right push would solve two problems

AGENT 47
But then you tried to kill me And you
forced the people I worked for to abandon
me You placed me into an impossible
situation

BELICOFF
Do you have any idea of the pain I endured
to look like Mikhail The others were
fine but I got an infection under the
steel facial structure The skin-grafts
never completely healed I am in constant
agony Not to mention the excruciating
ache I endured spending time with his
dilettante wife and whining children of
course I found ways to divert my
attention But then Mikhail decided that
perhaps returning to the old ways was not
such a good idea Support within the party
was waning They removed my face for the
cause and then he decides to become an
idealist I think not

AGENT 47
If you had just left me alone you could
very well be sitting in the Kremlin this
time next year

BELICOFF
So it seems We will never know You and
the whore were the only ones who knew the
truth And where is she now Do you have
fantasies of a life with her

47 looks at him

BELICOFF (CONT’D)
If you only knew the depraved things I made
per dos you would not be so eager to share
er bed

Td 47 is going to kill him now Suddenly -men start BANGING on the
bedroom door Belicoff slowly lifts his hand from his pocket

BELICOFF (CONT’D)
But youll never have that chance

Mischa holds out a tiny remote from his robe pocket

BELICOFF (CONT‘D
Panic button I pressed it when you came
in

AGENT 47
The door is steel We have a few moments

BELICOFF
Perhaps But you will never escape from
here alive There are over a hundred
soldiers here You are a dead man Some
consulation I suppose

47 just smiles glancing at his watch Mischa stares at him
stoic

BELICOFF (CONT’D)
There is nothing more I have to say to you

Then a thought brings an evil grin to Mischa’s face

BELICOFF (CONTD)
r Justknow the whore is broken I did it
myself She has no chance at a real life
With you dead she’ll return to the only
thing she knows And flat on her back all
she will have to dull the pain is a dim
memory of you Pathetic

these men are wearing armored vests and wielding serious
firepower All of Mike’s men including the HRT guys are
freaking out

MIKE
Who the fuck are you

A man walks over from one of the suburbans Despite his shades
we easily recognize him as Smith

SMITH

Intelligence Agency I need all of your
men out’ and to the rear of that vehicle

JENKINS
You don’t have jurisdiction here

SMITH
We aren’t here Which means when we open
up on Your and shred your bodies with
automatic-fire then this will never have
happened

Mike sighs as he is moved to the back of the second vehicle where
his men hands up against the vehicle are being relieved of their
weapons They are quickly joined by all the rest of his men

CLARKSON

you think you are doing

in terrorist activities

a moment

Diana about on the train from St Petersburg

But he is dressed

in a black suit with a red tie And his head has been shaved

A private drive winds through the trees up to the steps where a
taxiis parked Nika gets out of the taxi looks around and
giggles She starts to run inside

REAL ESTATE BROKER

Wait wait hold that taxi

A chic 30ish Frenchman dressed in a nice suit hurries down the

steps He leans in to the cabbie speaking
REAL ESTATE BROKER (CONT’D)

She’ stands back holding the envelope as the taxi speeds away
through the gate and down the private road

Nika opens the envelope and pulls out a card We PUSH IN as she
reads She glances at the taxi as it disappears then back at the
card Tears begin rolling down her face

She slumps down sitting on the steps Reading it again We PULL
BACK C ING UP as Nika cries We CONTINUE UP and BACK MOVING
QUICKLY away The image CHANGES We are now seeing the scene
from far away through a sniper scope

EXT HILL - DAY

47 lowers the scope not attached to a rifle He is not happy
He lifts the scope again

47s POV OF THE CHATEAU A servant comes out of the chateau
moving down the steps She rests her hand on Nika’s shoulder who
looks at her The maid motions her inside a compassionate smile
on her face Together they move into the chateau

BACK ON 47 who lowers the scope Through the stoic exterior we
feel the sadness The loneliness

We CRANE UP as 47 walks off toward the waiting Mercedes

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
