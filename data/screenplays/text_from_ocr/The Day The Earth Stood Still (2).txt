THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL

By

Scott Derrickson

FADE IN

Darkness The deep eternal silence of space A RING OF FIRE
looms against the void

We slowly MOVE around jt -- and the solar eclipse becomes a
widening crescent

As the MAIN CREDITS ROLL a tiny object drifts slowly into
frame dwarfed by Earths immensity

THE SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS

drifts suspended in orbit at the edge of the Earths glow
Its cargo bay doors slowly open

A ROBOTIC ARM extends into space releasing its payload -- a
DSCS-III listening satellite The satellite tumbles free
drifting into its own orbit

The cargo bay doors close and the Atlantis engines fire
propelling it onward to its next task

We hear a signal a strange atonal PULSE in space The
Atlantis follows the signal until it reaches its source --

- a SPHERE twelve feet in diameter drifting in the
satellite layer It is encased ina thick layer of ice and
dotted with impact craters like a small moon

Atlantis stands motionless before the Sphere Its robotic
arm stands poised in an empty gesture

Then slowly the Sphere begins to move toward the Atlantis
It enters the cargo hold The cargo bay doors slowly close
INT SPACE SHUTTLE -- CARGO HOLD

A HISS as the airlock door opens ASTRONAUTS in space suits
emerge pulling themselves through zerogravity into the hold

Then through the steam of the airlock they see it
THE SPHERE

looms in the cargo hold held fast by hydraulic pistons
designed to hold satellites in place

The Astronauts gaze upon the thing with bewildered eyes
Craters valleys mountains An entire world in miniature

Droplets of water drift around the sphere the ice is
melting A slab of ice comes free revealing the perfect
glassy surface beneath

Instinctively the LEAD ASTRONAUT reaches out a gloved hand
to touch the surface --

-- and suddenly as if by some unseen command the hydraulic
pistons begin to RETRACT setting the sphere free The
Astronauts back off as if afraid the thing might crush them

Instead it turns serenely on its axis before them Then
suddenly it stops --

- and we hear an offscreen HISS Red warning lights
illuminate the hold The Astronauts watch as the cargo hold
doors open

The Astronauts head for the airlock but the Lead Astronaut
remains behind gazing in wonder at the departing sphere He
reaches out instinctively drifting after it --

-— until finally he reaches the end of his tether and can go
no further

IN HIS FACEPLATE
We watch as the sphere slips away into the waiting void

As it drifts out of frame we look out onto the glowing blue
planet beneath us --

- and see dozens of other spheres of various sizes falling
from space and penetrating Earths atmosphere

The shuttles bay doors slowly close before us and we

cuT TO
SINGLE CELLS

teeming amidst their dark medium Blown up to millions of
times their size they seem to be another galactic nebula
another mystery of the cosmos

Over the image we hear a female voice

INT RESEARCH LABORATORY -- PRINCETON UNIVERSITY -- DAY

HELEN BENSON rises from the eyepiece of an electron
microscope consults her class list --

HELEN
-William Kwan

WILLIAM KWAN looks surprised to be picked out by name
HELEN (CONTD)
William what makes this bacteria so
remarkable

Kwan peers down at the clipboard held close to his chest
fumbling through his papers

Helen wears her lab coat over a T-shirt and jeans she seems
young enough to pass for one of her own students She turns

to an Arabic student MINA ROUHANI

HELEN (CONT’D)
Mina can you help him out

ROUHANI
Its the only organism that lives in
sulfuric acid

HELEN
Thats right

Helen guides her students to another specimen

HELEN (CONTD)

Dinococcus Radidorus First discovered
in 1998 breeding inside drums of
radioactive waste

As a student peers into the microscope

HELEN (CONTD)

Pompeiijana Thiobacillus Dinococcus
What can these three creatures tell us
about the nature of life in the universe
William

KWAN
Life is strange

Scattered laughter from the students

e ee ee ee

HELEN
yes life is strange but thats not
quite the answer I was looking for

ADAM a handsome grad student speaks up

ADAM
Life is diverse

HELEN
Life is diverse but what else

Silence from the assembled students

HELEN (CONT’D)
More than anything life is resilient

PUSH IN GENTLY on Helen as she talks isolating her --

HELEN (CONTD)
If you said even ten years ago that life
could exist in sulfuric acid or
radioactive waste youd have been laughed
out of this building But it can and it
does

We halt in CLOSE-UP on her

HELEN (CONTD)
Life is a force that adapts and
transforms itself even when faced with
impossible challenges Life goes on no
matter what

The class has ended Students start gathering up their
things to go Helen calls out

HELEN (CONTD)
Lab reports are due Friday

Only one student hangs behind

HELEN (CONT’D)
Do you have a question Adam

ADAM
Sort of I was wondering if we could
discuss it over coffee

HELEN
Discuss what

Helen looks at him a little flustered the blood rising in
her cheeks
HELEN
Well thats kind Adam but Im your
supervisor sO --
ADAM
So we wont talk extremophiles
Just then her cellphone rings
HELEN
Hey sweetheart No thats OK Ill
pick you up in twenty minutes
She hangs up the phone Burke looks a little crestfallen
HELEN (CONT’D)

She holds out the phone for him -- there on its screen isa
picture of a smiling eight-year-old boy
ADAM
Lucky guy-
He smiles and backs away Helen gathers her things to go
INT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

A sparsely-furnished apartment in faculty housing Helen i
chops vegetables for dinner
A wall clock TICKS softly in the background As she waits

for the water to boil she turns and enters
INTHELENS TOWNHOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

The Dining Room is filled with cardboard boxes

Pictureframes stand propped against the wall the photographs
within facing away as if hidden

She approaches a stack of boxes Its clear that shes been
putting this off for a while She opens one of the boxes
reaches inside --

-- and pulls out a pair of mens shoes She looks at them for
a moment then puts them back in the box and picks it up --

EXT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

She brings the box out to the dumpster out back She stands
there a moment motionless Then she turns around and
carries the box back inside

INTHELENS TOWNHOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

She returns to the dining room and puts the box down in
exactly the place where she first picked it up

INT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

JACOB her eight-year-old son sits on the floor playing a
first-person shooter videogame with headphones on

ONSCREEN Jacob is a rear-gunner riding in the back of a
Humvee through the desert

Helen sees this and reacts She taps the boy on the
shoulder

HELEN
Jacob Turn that off

The boy looks at her headphones still on

JACOB
I cant hear you

As she pulls them from his ears we hear the sound of GUNFIRE
from the headphones Onscreen his character takes a bullet
and dies

JACOB (CONTD)
You just killed me Mom

HELEN
What is this game
JACOB
Desert Mayhem 2
HELEN
Where did you get it
JACOB
Someone at school
HELEN
zt dont want you playing it anymore
JACOB
Why not
HELEN

Its too violent

JACOB
Life is violent

HELEN
Not your life Your life is fine

The boy grudgingly hands over the controller

JACOB
Maybe your life is fine

Onscreen the game resets Jacobs Soldier is alive again

HELEN
See Youre alive again

Then she shuts off the TV

HELEN (CONTD)
Go get ready for dinner

As Jacob heads off to the kitchen the telephone RINGS
INTHELENS TOWNHOUSE -- KITCHEN -— EVENING
Helen picks up the phone

HELEN
Hello

(a beat)
Yes Theyre at your door Now

The doorbell RINGS Flustered she considers hanging up the
phone then

HELEN
Hold on a second Dont hang up-

She puts the phone down on the kitchen counter She turns
and walks down the hallway toward the front door --

INT LIVING ROOMENTRYWAY -- EVENING

-- and what she sees stops her in her tracks Her living-
room windows are aglow with red-and-blue FLASHING LIGHTS
Jacob gazes at them in wonder

Helen reaches for the door -- we PUSH over her shoulder --

EXT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- EVENING

- and there standing on her doorstep is a MAN IN
PLAINCLOTHES accompanied by a STATE TROOPER

In the cul-de-sac beyond waits a BLACKED-OUT GOVERNMENT
UV flanked by two HIGHWAY PATROL CARS their flashing
lights casting everything aglow

PLAINCLOTHES
Dr Benson if youll come with us

Helen is stunned silent

PLAINCLOTHES (CONT ‘D)
Dr Benson Theres not much time

HELEN
Whats happening

PLAINCLOTHES
Everything will be explained But you
must come with us right away

HELEN
Am I under arrest
PLAINCLOTHES
Not officially no You are in State
Custody
HELEN
Whats the difference
PLAINCLOTHES
Everything will be explained to you en

PLAINCLOTHES
Youre coming with us Dr Benson

He says it with absolute finality The neighbors are
watching from their doorsteps ISABEL a neighbor calls out

ISABEL
I can watch him for a few hours

It seems theres no other option Helen bends over and
kisses her son

HELEN
Jacob youre going to have a sleepover
at Isabels Go on

Jacob runs next door casting an anxious glance back at his
mother as the Trooper leads her to the SUV

HELEN (CONTD)
Dont worry Jacob Everythings going
to be OK

INT SUV -- EVENING

The Plainclothes officer climbs in next to her In front sit
two others one of whom is furiously working a LAPTOP and
cellphone headset

LAPTOP WOMAN
(into headset)
Weve got her
(to Driver)
Lets move Go

The SUV peels out of the cul-de-sac

Outside the Patrol cars fall into Police Escort formation in
front of and behind the SUV their sirens SCREAMING

LAPTOP WOMAN (CONT’D)
(to Driver)
Two stoplights down then left There
should be an onramp for the Turnpike Do
you see it

They blow through a succession of red lights
HELEN

I think theres been a mistake Im not
the one you want

The truck su

onramp

Were doing 100 mph
suddenly realizes that there are no

LAPTOP WOMAN

(off her nod)
Theres no mistake

HELEN
Im a mom I teach school

LAPTOP WOMAN
Do you have a security clearance

HELEN
No

LAPTOP WOMAN
You do now Sign this

HELEN
Im not signing anything

HELEN (CONTD)
What is going on here

PLAINCLOTHES
Everything will be explained

HELEN
I want to know now

northbound side of the turnpike

HELEN (CONT’D)
Wait a minute Its rush hour Where
are all the cars

PLAINCLOTHES

They shut down the turnpike
HELEN

They shut it down What for
PLAINCLOTHES

For us
HELEN

They shut down the turnpike for us

ddenly accelerates as we take the Turnpike

Helen glances out the window and
other cars on the

She stares at him incredulous

HELEN (CONT’D)
Stop the vehicle If Im not under
arrest then you can’t take me wherever
youre taking me without my permission

PLAINCLOTHES
Its a matter of national security
Youre just going to have to —-

HELEN
National security Thats a blanket term
that means whatever you want it to mean
Tell me or let me out

He closes his cellphone Looks her in the eye
PLAINCLOTHES
Maam I cant tell you why they need
you because I dont know But I know
they need you I know its urgent

HELEN
How do you know

He gestures out the window They shut down the turnpike
Then she looks at him and she realizes hes afraid

She falls silent Looks out the window

They pass another onramp where another SUV speeds onto
the empty Turnpike accompanied by its own police escort
headed for the same destination

EXT AIRPORT -- RUNWAY -- EVENING

The §UVs blaze up a service road and onto the runway In
the distance a single CHINOOK MILITARY HELICOPTER stands on
a helipad

The §UV pulls up to the Chinook They hustle Helen out of
the §UV The Chinooks bay door ROLLS open --

INT CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- EVENING

—- to reveal a handful of ordinary-looking people already
waiting inside They all wear bewildered expressions It
seems theyve all gotten the same treatment

Helen steps inside A young Pakistani offers Helen his hand

YUSEF
I am Yusef i

HELEN
Im Helen

YUSEF
Helen do you have any idea why this is
happening to us

HELEN
None whatsoever

WINSLOW a bespectacled Black man fumes in his seat

WINSLOW
If I dont get some answers soon Im hee
calling my lawyer i

YUSEF
What could they want with us What have
we done wrong

HELEN
We havent done anything They need us
for some reason Why I don’t know

YUSEF j
Think Use inductive reasoning What do
we have in common

They look at one another Nothing

HELEN
What do you do for a living Yusef

YUSEF
I am a Nuclear Physicist

HELEN
Im a Biologist

WINSLOW
Well Im a Geologist

HELEN
So were all scientists

PASSENGER 4
Not me Im a defense contractor

PASSENGER 5
Civil Engineer

Helen turns to a wiry man in wraparound SUNGLASSES

HELEN
What about you What do you do

SUNGLASSES
I cant disclose that

Helen blinks

HELEN
OK Fair enough Put it all together
you get

Blank looks They still cant figure it out Another man
gazes out the window forlorn and silent

YUSEF
What about you my friend

ASTRONOMER

Im an Astronomer

(a soft voice)
I think I know whats happening

HELEN
Well why dont you share it with the
rest of us
The Astronomer doesnt look at them

ASTRONOMER
Because I hope to God Im wrong

The chopper begins to SPIN UP its rising whine drowning out
all further conversation The Chinook lifts off and we

CuT TO
EXT NEW JERSEY VISTA -- NIGHT

The helicopter soars above the rivers of glowing traffic
below Manhattan shimmers in the distance-

EXT FORT MONMOUTH ARMY BASE -— OVERHEAD -- NIGHT
From high overhead it is a teeming ant colony supply trucks

and vehicles stream in via every major artery The old army
base long closed is coming to life

We DESCEND toward it taking in the frenetic scramble of the
personnel on the ground below Whatever it is thats
happening its happening in a hurry

The Chinook touches down Its bay door ROLLS OPEN and
suddenly some National Guard SERGEANT is shouting at them —-

SERGEANT
Your attention please Make your way
directly across the courtyard to the Main
Barracks

They hurry across the courtyard toward a large warehouse-like
structure A group of Guardsmen stand outside the entrance
searching people confiscating cellphones

Helen slips to the back of the line quietly takes out her
cellphone and tucks it into the waistband of her pants to
conceal it Then the double doors open before us and we
enter -—-

INT MAIN BARRACKS (COMMAND CENTER )

Teeming with scientists from NASA and JPL and the Army
Corps of Engineers Large flat-panel screens running complex
computer simulations are everywhere

A huge CRAY MAINFRAME SUPERCOMPUTER stands at the center of
it all flanked by two refrigerator-size EMC hard drives
Technicians are running cable along the floors wheeling in
generators and air-conditioning units to keep it all running

Helen Yusef and the others stand there marveling at it all

Then her eyes light up with recognition

HELEN
Michel --

Hearing his name handsome rumpled DR MICHEL GRANIER looks
up and spots Helen His eyes light up a little at the sight
of her

GRANIER
Helen

A hesitant pause Then

GRANIER (CONT’D)
Its been a long time

HELEN
Are you the one behind all this

GRANIER
Yes Im glad you could be here

HELEN
Its not like I had a choice

GRANIER
Sorry I put you on the vital list I
thought it was important that we have a
Xenobiologist on the team

HELEN
Team of what

GRANIER
I dont have time to explain Theyll
erash-brief you in the conference room

He keeps moving leaving her behind He calls out to her

GRANIER (CONTD)
Helen Dont be afraid

Then hes gone Helen just stands there

HELEN
Afraid of what

She turns and sees her fellow passengers as theyre led into
INT BRIEFING ROOM

Darkened The briefing is already underway A blurry smudge
of light is projected on the wall A sleep-deprived young
TECHNICIAN with a NASA ID badge leads the briefing

NASA TECHNICIAN
Object 07493 was first spotted outside
Jupiters orbit by the Hubble Space
Telescope three days ago It was notable
for the fact that it was not moving in an
asteroidal ellipse but shooting through
our Solar System

WINSLOW
How large is this object

NASA TECHNICIAN
Its roughly a hundred meters in
diameter

WINSLOW
Thats an average-sized meteor

NASA TECHNICIAN
Average in size Not average in
velocity The object is moving at nearly
three times ten to the 8th meters per
second

The scientists exchange looks of disbelief

NASA TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
At first it was projected to pass
millions of miles beyond Earths orbit
It was a curiosity for the JPL-CalTech
conference circuit Then its trajectory
was recalculated

Another slide is projected it depicts a long parabola that
makes impact with Earth

NASA TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
At that point a crisis response team was
activated and everything you see around
you moved into action

YUSEF
So where Where does it make impact

Another slide A map of the Northeastern United States with
a series of CONCENTRIC CIRCLES laid over it

It looks like nothing so much as a target The bulls-eye is
placed squarely over Midtown Manhattan ‘Then shocked

WINSLOW
You must be joking

The NASA guy flicks on the lights

NASA TECHNICIAN
Our computer models are almost cruelly

accurate

WINSLOW
Cant we launch a missile to intercept
it

NASA TECHNICIAN
Impossible given the speed at which the
bolide is moving

HELEN
Why dont they evacuate the area

NASA TECHNICIAN
There is no time The area in question
consists of sixty million people All we
can do is prepare for the aftermath

YUSEF
How long do we have

NASA TECHNICIAN
Hours

INT MESS HALL -- NIGHT

The old mess hall has become a staging area where supplies
are being distributed A National Guard LIEUTENANT reads off
the operating procedure

GUARDSMAN
You will be issued one Hazmat suit which
you should check thoroughly for holes
One breathing apparatus one ChemBio
monitor one Geiger counter

Helen and the others file past tables where Guardsmen hand
out Hazmat suits She picks up her gear and moves on to her
assigned table marked Team Baker

Granier climbs up on one of the tables to address them

GRANIER

You have been selected to monitor the
impact zone for radiological
particulate andor biological
contamination

(a beat)
A few of you were drafted into service I
apologize for that Each of you has been
chosen for your specialized skills

Yusef is at Helens table He isnt listening Instead he
scribbles mathematical formulae on a scrap of paper

GRANIER (CONT’D)
You have been divided into eight teams of
five specialists each In the immediate
aftermath

YUSEF
This is all theater If this thing is
moving at three times ten to the 8th
meters per second there will be no
aftermath ‘There will be nothing left
but dust

GROSSMAN an anxious fidgety man pipes up

GROSSMAN
They say this thing has no light
signature Can you imagine
(off Helens look)
If it were an ordinary asteroid its
irregular surfaces would refract the
suns light as it spins --

HELEN
Youve already lost me

YUSEF
The object is perfectly round
Therefore it is not an asteroid
Besides it is moving too fast

HELEN
Then what is it

YUSEF
It may be a dead star

GROSSMAN
A piece of pure antimatter maybe

YUSEF
Or something our science has yet to
explain A black hole perhaps

HELEN
A black hole

Helen stares at him reeling She stands up and approaches
Granier taking him aside

HELEN (CONT’D)
Michel I want to go home I need to be
with my son

GRANIER
Your son needs you here Helen We need
you too

HELEN
I dont believe that What difference
could one more person possibly make

GRANIER
Youre not just one more person Youre
the leading researcher in your field —-

HELEN
I was once My research was repudiated

GRANIER
Repudiated by you

HELEN
Thats right

GRANIER
But there are plenty of people who still
believe --

HELEN
Theyre wrong
(a beat)
Im a professor now nothing more So
you wont be needing me

Granier shakes his head

GRANIER
If you choose not to participate then
that is your right But youre going to
have to remain here for the next 24
hours We cannot risk a panic

Helen stares at him betrayed

GRANIER (CONT’D)
Im sorry

INT MESS HALL -- LATER

Helen sits at an empty table drinking coffee from a
styrofoam cup A few other refuseniks sit nearby watched
over by a GUARDSWOMAN in camo fatigues

Helen gazes into her empty cup helpless and alone Yusef
comes over and sits beside her

YUSEF
So Helen What was your research field
(off her look)
I couldnt help overhearing

HELEN
I was a Xenobiologist

YUSEF
My Greeks a little rusty but doesnt
that mean strange biologist

HELEN
(smiles)
I studied the theoretical biology of life
on other planets

YUSEF
But you dont anymore

HELEN
It was wishful thinking not science

Back at Yusefs table theyre handing out radiation suits

YUSEF
If youll excuse me --
Helen nods She reaches into her waistband -- and finds her

cellphone

She rises from the table and nods inquiringly towards the
ladies room The Guardswoman nods

INT LADIES ROOM -- BATHROOM STALL

Helen leans against the door of the stall whispering into
her cell phone We can hear the noise of a TV set on the
other end of the line

HELEN

Theres gonna be a big storm tonight
like a hurricane so youve all got to
sleep in the basement okay Ive
already talked to Isabel about this
Dont come out until morning You wont
see any warnings on TV but trust me
Everythings going to be OK Just
promise me youll do that

(then)
I love you so much Jacob

A HEAVY KNOCK on the door of the stall Helen rises
collects herself She opens the door to find the Guardswoman
standing outside

GUARDSWOMAN
Is that a cellphone

Helen nods Busted Then

GUARDSWOMAN (CONT’D)
Can I borrow it

Helen blinks surprised She hands the phone to the
Guardswoman and leans against the sink waiting

GUARDSWOMAN (CONTD)
Baby its me I don’t have much time to
talk

One by one other women enter the bathroom see the phone
and line up behind the Guardswoman waiting to make what may
be for each of them their last phone call

INT MESS HALL

Yusef and the rest of Team Baker are sitting in their Hazmat
suits waiting to be deployed

They watch as Helen walks out of the bathroom She
approaches the table and picks up her Hazmat suit

HELEN
Will somebody tell me how to put this
thing on

CUT TO
DARK WATER

rushes beneath us We are flying low over the Atlantic
Coast We begin to ASCEND and suddenly it looms before us —-

-- the glowing constellation that is Manhattan We race
toward it flanked by other Chinooks flying in formation

INT CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

Helen sits by the window watching as the city looms ever
larger She turns and looks at the others --

-- they sit in silence Someone is holding a rosary as he
mutters a prayer Yusef fingers a set of worry beads
YUSEF
Its strange I dont want to die and

yet my heart is light As a scientist I

cant help being excited to see it even
if its the last thing I see before I
die Am I crazy

Helen glances at the laptop computer mounted in the
On its screen a countdown is in progress 000041

HELEN
It doesnt make sense The odds of a
bolide making impact in the middle of
Midtown Manhattan are --

HELEN
All theater

The Chinook reaches its designated position over the East

River and hovers in place

Dozens of other helicopters are scattered like fireflies

across the luminous city skyline

HELEN (CONTD)
God I loved this city

They fall silent watching the clock run down --
-- five four three two one 00000000
Nothing happens

YUSEF
Where is it

Everyone laughs nervously Theyve cheated death

YUSEF (CONT’D)
So much for their supercomputer

HELEN
A mistake It was all a mistake

A CRACKLING of voices on the radio

it seems

PILOT
Wait Theyre Roger that Theyre
telling me the object is still in its
approach

HELEN
Where is it

PILOT
Its slowing down

YUSEF
Its slowing down

HELEN
Look

An eerie GLOW suffuses the Eastern sky The white aura
slowly grows spreading through the dome of the heavens

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST -- NIGHT

Scattered pedestrians carrying briefcases and shopping bags
make their way home A YOUNG MOTHER pushing a stroller
glimpses something out of the corner of her eye She stops
and gazes into the sky --

-- where the distant glow begins to coalesce to focus itself
into a small intense point of light

The light is moving across the sky like a falling star --
but this star is falling toward us

One by one more pedestrians stop and turn their faces to the
sky as the falling star traces its long elegant parabola
across the night A crowd is gathering

Drivers in cars crane their necks out their windows to see
it A Taxi driver gazes out his window mesmerized

The light moves through the sky reflected in the mirrored
glass of Midtown skyscrapers as people look on in awe

Shafts of LENS FLARE shimmer endlessly in the night sky and
suddenly --

-- it is here a celestial presence looming large before us
It begins to DECELERATE visibly slowing down as it

approaches The awed murmur of the crowd becomes a stunned
silence

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- OVERHEAD -- NIGHT

It descends toward Sheeps Meadow at an almost majestic pace
until it hangs suspended a few hundred feet from the ground
Central Park has become a great box of light

EXT 79TH STREET -- NIGHT

Shafts of white starlight shimmer endlessly down the urban
canyons it is as if the city were illuminated from within

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- NIGHT

Every face is turned toward the light The only sound is
that of the autumn breeze through the trees There is a long
pregnant moment of silence while the crowd below the sphere
stares up in quiet awe

As the light makes its final descent toward Sheeps Meadow a
blast of powerful wind and white moisture blows a divot into
the ground below creating a tremendous BLAST of mist dirt
and debris The sound is deafening

It becomes a great roiling cloud that fills the whole of
Central Park The cloud envelops the fallen star until it
looks like a great earthbound thundercloud shot through with
lightning

It overcomes many of the onlookers below -- even knocking
some to the ground raising scattered screams from the crowd
The woman with the stroller grabs her baby just as the
stroller is blown away

Then finally the fallen star begins to dim as if swallowed
whole by the cloud

The light is gone the spell is broken A ripple of fear and
confusion moves through the crowd SIRENS approach from
every direction

INT CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

The helicopter races toward the city We enter the canyon of
79th street --

-- to see that the distant plume of debris has become a great
MUSHROOM CLOUD rising from the heart of Central Park

Police and News HELICOPTERS buzz around the great cloud
their searchlights probing its darkness

EXT 79TH STREET -- NIGHT

The entire street has been barricaded off The Chinook
touches down at 79th and Madison The bay door rolls open --

-- and they climb out in their Hazmat suits A Humvee loaded
down with monitoring equipment is waiting for them

They climb in and the Hazmat-suited DRIVER puts the truck in
gear At Fifth Avenue we see that a cordon of National
Guard vehicles has already sealed off Central Park

INT CENTRAL PARK -- NIGHT

We enter the park and soon find ourselves at the edge of the
great cloud The Humvee rolls on until it can go no further

Helen climbs out of the Humvee a particulate monitor slung
over her shoulder

She enters the cloud of swirling dust and debris All we
hear is the sound of her BREATHING and scattered bandlink
transmissions in her earpiece

VOICES (V0)
Team Alpha on Channel One Keep this
channel clear for emergencies Alpha
Team Baker on Channel Two

They shuffle their way through the dense cloud like
Astronauts on a snowbound planet A few lonely human forms
amidst a few barely visible trees

We hear the CLICKING of Geiger counters the soft PINGING of
particulate monitors On Channel Two we hear a voice that
we recognize as Grossmans

GROSSMAN (VO)
Isotope levels elevated but not
dangerous
(static)
--getting a lot of electrostatic
interference

YUSEF (V0O)
Me too Did you feel that

GROSSMAN (V0)
Feel what

Helen stops in her tracks
pian

HELEN
I feel it

We feel it too A deep soundless RUMBLING in your bones

We can feel it MOVING unseen like a great ghost ship
passing in the fog

HELEN (CONT’‘D)
Its close

She takes a few steps forward We can see TINY LIGHTS gently
pulsing like beacons through the fog

She walks with careful steps in its direction She stops and
gazes up with wide unseeing eyes feeling its immensity
hearing its otherworldly HUM in her ears

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- OVERHEAD -- NIGHT

We take in the whole tableau the cloud that has enveloped
Sheeps Meadow the helicopters the military vehicles and
EMTs that surround it

Now silently almost peacefully A GENTLE BREEZE blows in
off the river It begins to stir the leaves on the trees

The Cloud begins to shift in the breeze It ever-so-slowly
drifts toward the West --

and like a great curtain being drawn aside it gradually
reveals what lies beneath

AN ENORMOUS SPHERE

stands on the meadow illuminated by the searchlights of
hovering helicopters

It seems almost like a planet of its own its surface teems
with swirling gases and scattered sparks of lightning

It looms forty stories high and forty stories wide From
high above its as if Central Park were nothing more than a
box designed to hold this strange jewel

HELEN

stands in its shadow overwhelmed But now as all the
other scientists back away from the sphere in fear --

-- Helen steps forward instinctively moving towards it

She stares at it in mute reverence as if it were the
embodiment of dreams long abandoned

In the background we can see MILITARY VEHICLES forming a
perimeter around the sphere their weapons poised against it

MILITARY SNIPERS take up positions on nearby rooftops
SHOUTING VOICES can be heard on the radio

RADIO VOICES (V0)
--maintain a security perimeter around
the object Negative awaiting
protocol instructions from Washington

She stands in reverent silence before the globe She
watches fascinated as the atmospheric gases that cover its
surface swirl around it in storm-like whorls and eddies

The voices on the radio multiply and overlap

RADIO VOICES (V0) (CONT’D)
There is no protocol for this
situation violation of our airspace
I am in command here No one acts
without my order

The gases that surround the sphere gather in a hurricane-like
whorl Its eye opens and becomes a portal

RADIO VOICES (VO) (CONTD)
Somethings happening Its moving
--cant hear you Keep this channel
clear Wait someones coming out of
it

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE steps into the opening

Helen remains motionless as it emerges from the portal and
slowly makes its way toward her Now it comes into focus

AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEING

a pale grayish humanoid figure with large dark eyes and an
oversized head

Helen gazes at it eyes wide her face bathed in light At
the sight of it a single tear rolls down her cheek

RADIO VOICES (V0) (CONT’D)
What in Gods name Its advancing
lower your weapons we are locked and
loaded no one does anything until

The Being gazes at her for a long moment It reaches out to
her with long elegant fingers The voices on the radio
become a cacophony building to a panicked crescendo

RADIO VOICES (V0) (CONT’D)
Its advancing if it gets any closer
prepare to fire hold your fire lower
your weapons do not I repeat do
not fire on my command do not

She reaches out to take its hand to touch it --

RADIO VOICES (V0) (CONTD)
FIRE

-- and A GUNSHOT rings out Helens suit is spattered with
blood The Being groans and collapses into her arms

She crouches holding it tightly in her arms sheltering it
from the gunfire She reaches out for her radio

HELEN
Stop Dont shoot

RADIO VOICES (V0)
Hold your fire Hold your fire

She gazes into its eyes sees the pain of betrayal

She crouches there holding it as its blood spills out all
over her suit Then she hears something She looks up --

-- the atmospheric clouds on the spheres surface seem to
darken before us We feel that familiar rumbling again but
this time deeper more menacing

All eyes turn toward the sphere as it begins to GLOW turning
an angry reddish-orange the whorls and eddies on its surface
teeming like flares upon the surface of the sun building
brighter almost blinding --

-- until suddenly the chorus of static and walkie-talkies
GOES DEAD

Every light in the area -- the sodium lights directed at the
sphere the headlights of the Humvees -- all go dark

An eerie SILENCE pervades Then something emerges from the
portal -- sphere something unlike anything weve ever seen

Though it weighs several tons it moves swiftly gracefully
on four legs with a predatory pantherlike gait

e eH

It is covered in a steel-grey carapace it seems neither
animal nor machine but some kind of IDOL some primitive
God

And this God is angry

It stands before the disabled war machines rearing up and
it emits a high-pitched piercing SOUND -- or rather a chorus
of sounds like the teeming of a vast angry swarm issuing
from within its body

The sound is devastating Soldiers and scientists fall to
their knees covering their ears to block out the sound It
begins to approach the immobilized forces --

-- when a strange VOICE is heard The Being in Helens arms
issues a hoarse COMMAND in an alien tongue -- it reaches out
with its hand gesturing --

-- and the Idol abruptly stops It rises into an erect
posture folding its limbs in upon itself until finally it
stands dormant and motionless like a great primitive totem

The shrieking sound has ceased Upon the Beings command
the Spheres angry hue has dimmed turned tranquil

The strain of this effort has taken its toll on the Being in
Helens arms It begins to lose consciousness

RADIO VOICES (VO) (CONT’D)
Somebody call in a Medevac chopper

The Medevac helicopter descends and touches down MEDICS
sweep in and shove Helen aside They load the wounded Being
onto a stretcher

As Helen follows them back to the helicopter she casts a
final glance back --

- at the great sphere on the lawn and the fearsome Idol
that stands before it staring back at her

INT FORT MONMOUTH -- MILITARY INFIRMARY -- NIGHT

A long desolate institutional corridor with a set of DOUBLE
DOORS at its end

ee

We hear a distant HELICOPTER 0S then SHOUTING VOICES and
then --

-- the double doors BURST open Guardsmen and scientists
flood the corridor amidst the frantic SQUEALING of walkie-
talkies

Granier is amongst them looking confused and overwhelmed
From outside more shouting The doors BLOW OPEN --

and a GURNEY careens headlong down the corridor pushed by
the medics A shell-shocked Helen follows close behind

As they enter the operating room a young Guardsman stops
her

GUARDSMAN
Authorized personnel only

HELEN
They need me in there Im not letting
that thing out of my sight Get
authorization from Dr Granier if you
have to

As the Guardsman searches the crowd inside for Granier he is
overwhelmed by another wave of medics and equipment Helen
impatiently sweeps in along with them into

INT OPERATING THEATER

A steel operating table surrounded arena-like by empty
chairs The gurney is wheeled up to the operating table --

MEDIC
On three One two three --

and we gaze down upon the wounded Being lying on the table

Helen fades into the background as scientists swarm into the
theater to look at the thing The panicked MEDIC has to
shout over the din

MEDIC (CONT’D)
What am I supposed to do now Should I
give him fluids

GRANIER
We dont know its physiology For all we
know the fluids could kill it

MEDIC
What do I do then Its bleeding out
What do I do --

Granier shakes his head baffled

Standing in the background Helen looks down at the blood on
her suit

HELEN
Blood
She hesitates a moment -- after all shes not supposed to be
here -- then calls out to Granier

HELEN (CONT’D)
Blood Its blood is oxygenated Its
system is water-based like ours

GRANIER
Shes right Well have to take our
chances Give him IV fluids

MEDIC
I cant find a vein It doesnt have any
veins

GRANIER

Subcutaneous then

An EKG is attached to the creature A faint pulse is
discovered Then --

-- the Being begins to go into a seizure

MEDIC
Its going into cardiac arrest

A crash cart is wheeled out More medics crowd around

From the shadows Helen drifts ever closer to the Being on
the table as if drawn to it

A second Medic applies gel to the Beings chest then takes
out a set of DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES --

MEDIC 2
Clear

A jolt of electricity The Being convulses and then
suddenly as if in reply --

-- a SECOND JOLT blasts back through the paddles SHOCKING
the Medic who drops the paddles He almost falls over

The Medics look at one another bewildered The first Medic
checks the defibrillator

MEDIC
Its dead Thing shorted it out

MEDIC 3
Pulse is stabilizing Its stabilizing

The EKG confirms it the Beings faint pulse is
normalizing The Medics turn to Granier

MEDIC
What now sir

Granier turns to Helen

GRANIER
Helen

Everyone in the room -- thirty scientists - all turn to look
at Helen

GRANIER (CONT’D)
This is your specialty not ours

She glances over at the creature lying on the steel table
Then

HELEN
Surgeons We need surgeons

cur TO
SURGEONS

as they enter the observation booth that overlooks the
operating theater

INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH

Helen looks them over Some are still wearing their pajamas
underneath their overcoats

ANGRY SURGEON
You kidnap me in the middle of the night
and expect me to sign a release form

They are led to the window and gaze down upon the Being on
its steel table The operating theater has been cleared
Trays of sterilized surgical instruments stand at the ready

The assembled surgeons stare down at the being below in mute
astonishment Then

SURGEON 1
Absolutely not

SURGEON 2
I was trained to operate on human beings
not this

SURGEON 3
You need to consult a veterinarian

SURGEON 4
You need to leave it alone Its an
epidemiological nightmare

SURGEON 1
Hes right Quarantine it

Granier looks at Helen anxiously Theyre running out of
doctors Granier looks at their last option --

the Angry Surgeon Hes become very quiet He gazes through
the glass with a gleam in his eye Finally he turns to
Granier

ANGRY SURGEON
Where do I scrub in

cut TO
AN OLD TRANSISTOR RADIO

as its tuned in to a classical radio station Apparently
the Angry Surgeon -- henceforth known as DR MYRON -- likes
to listen to Puccini as he operates

He stands over the operating table wearing an oxygen mask
and goggles to protect against any possible Xenoviral
infection His anxious-looking NURSES have been outfitted
with the same precautions

The surgeon selects a gleaming scalpel and goes to work

INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH

Granier and Helen watch in rapt silence along with a dozen
other scientists Dr Myron provides color commentary via
INTERCOM for the benefit of his spellbound audience

DR MYRON
Normally for gunshot wed be using
general anaesthesia but as we dont know
how the uh patient will react Im
opting for a local

INT OPERATING THEATER

The surgeons scalpel hovers over the gray alien flesh The
nurses take a cautious half-step back

DR MYRON
Making the first incision now

As he cuts the Being twitches in small spasms
DR MYRON (CONT’D)
No explosions So far so good
(laughs nervously)
Pale flesh the texture is akin to
what Whale blubber I have no point of
reference Im taking a specimen now

He removes a small segment of gray flesh and carefully places
it inside a glass test tube

INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH
HELEN
You should pack that in ice and chopper
it to a genomics lab for DNA mapping
DR MYRON
Retractor please Im entering the
wound now and whats this
INT OPERATING THEATER
The surgeon has fallen silent He steps away from the table

DR MYRON
Im sorry Ima little taken aback

INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH

Granier reaches for the intercom button

GRANIER
Please explain Doctor
DR MYRON
I had expected anything But not this
GRANIER
Whats wrong
DR MYRON
Nothings wrong Thats the thing It
all seems so familiar

INT OPERATING THEATER
The surgeon gazes down at his patient confused

DR MYRON
The outer flesh is exotic strange But
as I go deeper I find muscle nerves
veins bone

He cuts away another segment of gray flesh
DR MYRON (CONTD)
This pale flesh It just slices away
and beneath it is
(a beat)
Id like to keep cutting if thats all
right with you
INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH

Granier looks at Helen She nods in agreement Granier hits
the intercom button

GRANIER
Very well Keep cutting

INT OPERATING THEATER

The surgeon cuts away ever larger segments of pale flesh
setting aside whole slabs of it on specimen trays He looks
up toward the observation booth for guidance

DR MYRON
More

INT OPERATING THEATER OBSERVATION BOOTH

The assembled scientists look on with mounting bewilderment

GRANIER
Yes More Keep cutting

INT OPERATING THEATER

The Puccini Aria builds in intensity Like a sculptor
toiling over a slab of marble the surgeon is utterly
absorbed by his work He occasionally glances skyward --

-- to see the scientists looking down from above expressions
of utter incredulity on their faces

CLOSE ON the surgeons gloved hand as it wrests something
from within the Beings very throat -- the Being seems to
choke as its wrested free --

-- and we reveal that its almost like a long umbilical cord
The surgeon sets it aside and keeps working He doesnt even
ask permission anymore He just keeps cutting --

until finally his work is done He steps back from the
table sets his scalpel aside and looks up at the scientists
above The assembled scientists gaze down at the operating
table dumbstruck

HELEN
It cant be

But it is Now finally as the Aria reaches its crescendo
we PULL BACK to gaze down at the operating table from above
and we behold what remains

A HUMAN BEING

lies on the operating table amidst scattered remnants of gray
flesh

It is in a nascent state its body hairless damp and pale
weighing no more than ninety pounds

Its limbs are twisted contorted with the pain of its forced
birth a butterfly torn from its chrysalis

The scientists stand there in silence trying to fathom this
thing reeling at the implications Finally Granier turns
to Helen

GRANTER
Tell me please What is the meaning of
this

Helen just shakes her head
DISSOLVE TO
EXT STRATOSPHERE -— DAWN

The sun rises over the cloud layer A distant METALLIC
OBJECT skims over the sea of mist As it comes into focus we
realize that its a

INT GULFSTREAM V JET -- CABIN -- DAWN

The wood-paneled cabin has the tightly controlled air of a
crisis center On a wall-mounted TV Fox News is
broadcasting images of the great Sphere in Central Park
where a crowd has gathered outside the barricades on 5th
Avenue

Everyone on the plane has gathered around the TV screen --
except for one woman who sits by the window wrapping up a
phone call A man in a GREY SUIT approaches whispers

GREY SUIT
Madame Secretary As soon as youre
ready we can begin

The woman nods The staffers watch the broadcast with barely
controlled anxiety But as she takes her seat REGINA
JACKSON behaves as if this were just another day on the job

GREY SUIT (CONTD)
Several hours before NASA first detected
the sphere approaching Earth we lost
contact with one of our DSCS-III
listening satellites orbiting Earth

The man in the grey suit flicks a button on the remote --

GREY SUIT (CONT’D)
Space Shuttle Atlantis was tasked to
check on the satellite and perform
Maintenance as needed But shortly after
releasing the satellite this is what she
found --

-- and a pixilated VIDEO IMAGE appears onscreen We
recognize it immediately the Atlantis cargo bay the sphere
surrounded by the curious Astronauts

REGINA
So the Sphere in Central Park isnt the
only one

GREY SUIT
No maam In fact we have unverified
intelligence that spheres like the one
Atlantis encountered have landed in other
locations around the world

REGINA
Where

GREY SUIT
So far weve there have been sightings
in Patagonia another in Sulawesi
Indonesia --

REGINA
But none in populated areas

GREY SUIT
No maam

REGINA
And nothing has emerged from any of these
spheres

GREY SUIT
No maam Until now

A silence Tightly-wound UNDERSECRETARY JOHN DRISCOLL points
at the image of the sphere inside the Shuttle

DRISCOLL
Where is this sphere now

GREY SUIT
We lost the sphere

DRISCOLL
You lost it How do you lose something
that big

On the monitor the cargo bay door slowly opens

GREY SUIT
It seems to have let itself out

A bewildered silence

REGINA
Excuse me John but I think were asking
the wrong questions

OE

DRISCOLL
Really What questions should we be
asking

REGINA
Lets start with this Wheres our
satellite

GREY SUIT
The satellite seems to have vanished

DRISCOLL
In the scheme of things the loss of one
satellite --

REGINA
DSCS-III stands for Defense Systems
Communications Satellite Remember what
it communicates with

A silence They realize what shes getting at

REGINA (CONTD)

On top of that theres a vast amount of
vital intelligence stored on its hard
drives They know a lot about us now
We know next to nothing about them

(a beat)
But the fact that they picked off that
particular satellite tells us something
about their intentions Dont you think

Her words hang heavy in the air Onscreen the cargo bay
doors close and the elusive sphere slips away once more

INT FORT MONMOUTH -- MILITARY INFIRMARY -- DAY

The corridor is alive with activity scientists and medics
frantically exchange information about the new discovery in
the next room

Helen stands alone motionless amidst the chaos Its only
beginning to sink in for her She approaches the doorway
that leads into

INT OPERATING THEATER

Darkened The operating table and the Being upon it have
been swathed in a plastic oxygen tent

The tent is misted over with condensation clouding our view
of the form within The only sound is the gentle HISSING of
oxygen pumps

The Beings arm is pressed against the plastic of the tent
She gazes at it for a moment --

-- the veins on the Beings skeletal arm have filled out
since we last saw him Muscles are now visible under the
skin Fine hairs have begun to grow on ths skin of his
forearm

Helen reacts to these changes with awe Its growing

Fluttering furiously atop the hood of a black Lincoln
Navigator -- one of a dozen SUVs in the motorcade

The convoy snakes toward the heavily guarded entrance

GRANIER (V0O)
Madame Secretary these geneticists were
brought in to study tissue samples
harvested from the Being

INT SICK WARDGENETICS LAB - DAY

The infirmary has been transformed the bunks and mattresses
have all been rolled away and lab equipment and racks of
computer servers have been wheeled in

Helen stands with Granier Regina and Driscoll DR IKEGAWA
motions them toward a trio of huge flat-panel monitors each
one displaying an intricate DOUBLE HELIX

DR IKEGAWA
The Being is in a nascent state Weve
taken samples of its body tissue neural
tissue and this grey flesh it came
wrapped in These samples represent
three distinct life forms

REGINA
Three different DNA types

IKEGAWA
Three different species entirely

He gestures at the left-hand screen

IKEGAWA (CONT’D)

The body tissue is human grown from a
simplified approximation of our genetic
code

(next screen)
The gray flesh encasing it seems to be a
life-support system made of organic
material -- some kind of bio-engineered
space suit What it most resembles
oddly enough is placental tissue

Regina blinks

HELEN
Placenta is the oldest life-support
system known to man It makes perfect
sense really Wed have thought of it
ourselves eventually

REGINA
Why bother becoming human at all Why
not just come here in its own body

IKEGAWA
Most likely its body couldnt survive in
our environment

GRANIER
Why didnt it wait until it was in human
form to emerge from the sphere

HELEN
It needed contact with human DNA Its
still collecting it to complete its
growth

Suddenly a single luminous chain of DNA takes over all three
screens practically surrounding them Alongside it is the
MRI image of the Beings brain

REGINA
This is from the things brain

IKEGAWA
Yes It is orders of magnitude more
complex than anything weve ever seen
before
REGINA
(to Ikegawa)

How much can you tell us about it by
decoding its DNA

TKEGAWA
(laughs)

You dont understand These are the Dead
Sea Scrolls Geneticists are going to be

studying this code for generations

REGINA

No They arent This code is the
property of the US Government Its very
existence is classified

(to Granier)
From now on I have to ask that any
discovery of new information comes to me
first I need to know what were up
against

The scientists exchange uncomfortable glances

IKEGAWA
It may be that were not up against
anything at all

Regina looks to Granier

REGINA
I want to speak to it

Granier shakes his head

GRANIER
The Being is still fragile --

REGINA
Ill be gentle

GRANIER
Im afraid I must insist This is the
most important discovery in the history
of mankind

REGINA

It may well be the last discovery in the
history of mankind If the thing on that
table can speak we need to hear what it
has to say as quickly as possible so we

can prepare for whatever comes next

Granier falls silent He has no choice

GRANIER
As you wish Helen would you show her
the way

Helen nods then leads Granier Driscoll and Regina into
INT OPERATING THEATER

Darkened but for a simple spotlight shining on the metal
table in the center of the room The Being lies on the
table still shrouded in its plastic tent

Wires and electrodes are attached to every part of its body
A technician monitors the data on a nearby screen

Helen quietly approaches the rack of test tubes of grey
flesh She casts a glance at Regina at the other side of the
room then surreptitiously slips one of the test tubes into
her pocket

Helen approaches the tent Through the plastic we can
discern a single sleeping eye Its pupil sweeps back and
forth in REM sleep -- but at a ferocious speed

HELEN
Its dreaming
(to technician)
Any indication of neural activity

TECHNICIAN
It lit up the MRI like Times Square

Suddenly through the tent we see the Beings eye open

HELEN
Its awake --

CLOSE ON the pupil as it dilates adjusting to the light It
blinks and then --

-- The Being suddenly REACHES for the tangle of IV tubes and
electrodes attached to its other arm jerking spasmodically
trying to pull them out --

Instinctively Helen reaches out and grabs the things arm
trying to keep it from pulling the IV tubes free --

HELEN (CONTD)
Go Get help

The technician hurries out Helen grips it gingerly by the
wrist It struggles for a few moments and then --

-- it finally surrenders Through the oxygen tent the eye
is staring at her She stands there frozen in its gaze

The eye adjusts blinks its mind experiencing -- what

GRANIER
It recognizes you Speak to it

HELEN
It wont understand

GRANIER
It may understand your intentions Speak
to it very calmly
Helen gazes into the creatures eye
HELEN
My name is Doctor Helen Benson I ama
friend to you We are trying to help
you You have nothing to fear from us
CLOSE ON the eye A long moment Then --
-- A trance-like WHISPER emanates from its lips

THE BEING
-friend help you nothing to fear

Helen backs away stunned
REGINA
Does it understand your words or is it
just parroting what you said

HELEN
I I believe it understood me

THE BEING
«water

Stunned they all stare at the Being Granier pours a glass

of water from a nearby pitcher as TECHNICIANS enter the room

GRANIER
Remove the oxygen tent

They peel back the flaps and Helen presses a button The
back of the table tilts slowly into a seated position

Gradually for the first time the Being is revealed --

-- and what sits before us appears utterly human Wiry with
a fine stubble of hair growing on his skull

What is most striking are his eyes they are almost
unnaturally serene yet they reveal nothing They gaze right
into you

Granier steps forward hands the Being the water his hands
tremble like those of a patient with a severe neurological
disorder He struggles to raise the cup to its lips
Helen speaks quietly to Granier Regina and Driscoll
HELEN
It used the word water None of us
said that in its presence

GRANIER
It already knows our language

Driscoll shrugs says without thinking
DRISCOLL
Theyve hacked our satellites They know
everything about us --

REGINA
Mr Driscoll Thats classified

He falls silent Helen and Granier exchange a look

THE BEING
Come closer

They stare at the Being stunned he is speaking in perfect
uninflected English

Regina steps forward into the light Clears her throat

REGINA
My name is Regina Jackson

A moment
REGINA (CONT’D)
I am the Secretary of Defense of the
United States of America

The Being doesnt react Instead his gaze remains on the
glass of water cupped in his hands

REGINA (CONTD)
Ive been sent here to determine who or
what you represent what your intentions
are and if possible to open a
dialogue

The Being doesnt seem to hear her He is utterly focused on
raising the trembling glass of water to his lips

Regina falls silent They watch spellbound as he raises
the glass high enough at last and drinks It appears to
have been an act of supreme willpower

He carefully lowers the glass Sets it on the metal tray
THE BEING
This body will take some getting used to
It feels unreal to me Alien
(eyes his shuddering hand)
I will have to adapt somehow
Helen steps forward and addresses him in a near-whisper

HELEN
What were you before you became human

THE BEING
Different

HELEN
Different how

THE BEING
It would only frighten you

HELEN
Perhaps But we still want to know
everything about you
The Being looks at her closely studying her Then

THE BEING
What do you want to know

Helens mind reels she has a million questions at once

HELEN
Lets start with this do you have a
name

THE BEING

Klaatu

HELEN
And whatcivilization do you represent

KLAATU
I represent a group of civilizations

HELEN
Where is this group of civilizations

KLAATU glances skyward toward the heavens above

KLAATU
All around you

Regina steps forward

REGINA
What is your purpose

KLAATU
There is a gathering of world leaders not
far from here I will explain my purpose
to them

REGINA
Im afraid thats not possible Perhaps
you should explain yourself to me
instead

KLAATU
Do you speak for the entire human race

REGINA
I speak for the President of the United
States Now please tell me why have you
come to our planet

KLAATU
Your planet

REGINA
Yes This is our planet

Klaatu looks at her differently for the first time

KLAATU
No It isnt

Regina stiffens She draws herself upright

REGINA
In coming here you have violated our
airspace Youve mounted an attack on
our troops --

KLAATU
Ive attacked no one

REGINA
That thing in the park --

KLAATU
It acted only to defend me when I was
shot It reacts to violence It attacks
only when attacked or when I command it

REGINA
It seems we have something in common We
also defend ourselves when threatened

KLAATU
youre afraid

REGINA
Excuse me

KLAATU
Youre afraid
(beat)
And for good reason

INT SICK WARDGENETICS LAB - DAY

The members of the science team -- Helen Granier Ikegawa
Dr Myron and the others -- wait in anxious silence

Helen stares at the floor hands thrust in her pockets From
the hallway outside FOOTSTEPS are heard -— and Regina
enters along with her coterie of staffers

The scientists snap to attention Regina shakes a few hands
Granier pulls up a chair for her

REGINA
Thats all right Ill keep this brief
(a beat)
Ive spoken with the President and the
other members of the cabinet

The room falls silent

REGINA (CONT’D)
As you know the situation is still
unclear We still dont understand the
motives of this entity But its
recent actions suggest those motives
arent benign

Helen tenses

REGINA (CONT’D)
The Being in our custody represents a
bargaining chip as well as a potential
source of intelligence As a result
weve decided to sedate him until further
notice

A murmur of protest from the scientists

IKEGAWA
Bargaining chip” Is that another word
for hostage

DR MYRON
Are you going to interrogate him

REGINA
Thats a possibility

Granier has had enough

GRANIER
Madame Secretary As scientists we
cannot consent to this

Regina speaks in soothing tones

REGINA
You are men and women of science I have
the utmost respect for that
(smiles )
Maybe its because I was never much good
at science in school I was smart but
not that smart

Her smile starts to fade

REGINA (CONT’D)
I studied history instead
(a beat)
History has lessons to teach us about
first encounters between civilizations
(MORE )
REGINA (CONT’D)

As a rule the less-advanced species is
either exterminated or enslaved Im
thinking of Pizarro and the Incas
Columbus and the Native Americansthe
list goes on

(a beat)
Unfortunately in this case the less-
advanced civilization is us

Shes got a point But Granier just shakes his head

GRANIER
This is our first encounter with a
representative of an extraterrestrial
civilization Already youve shot hin
Next you want to drug him Interrogate
him

PUSH IN on Helen as she watches with mounting anxiety

GRANIER (CONT’D)
We wont do it Understand

REGINA
I understand completely Of course if
you wont do it well have to call in
someone who will

GRANIER
Im sure you can find someone who will do
it But we wont --

HELEN
Ill do it

Everyone turns and looks at Helen

GRANIER
Helen --

HELEN
I said Ill do it

Granier stares at her Regina nods satisfied

REGINA
Its settled then

INT MEDICAL DISPENSARY - DAY

Helen enters the dispensary accompanied by Regina and two

National guard MPs She makes for the supply room

Arranged on its shelves are glass ampules She grabs a
surgical syringe then selects an ampule marked MIDAZOLAM
(BENZODIAZEPRINE ) WARNING STRONG SEDATIVE
HELEN
(to MPs)
Were good to go
They turn to leave But as she goes she whisks another
ampule off the shelf -- this one is labeled GLUCOSE SOLUTION
Both ampules disappear into the pocket of her lab coat
As they exit they pass Granier and others in the hallway

GRANIER
You dont have to do this

HELEN
You heard what she said If we dont do
it someone else will
He watches as she walks off down the long passage
FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR

Helen motions toward the ladies room

HELEN (CONT’D)
Could you give me a minute

Masking her impatience Regina nods Helen enters

INT LADIES ROOM - DAY

Stepping into the empty bathroom Helens calm demeanor is
replaced by panic She paces back and forth trying to

control her breathing

Moving to the sink she splashes cold water on her face
Stares at her reflection in the mirror mind racing

Drying her face with a towel Helen reaches into her pocket
and removes the bottles she took from the dispensary

Staring at them she calms a little Closes her eyes and
takes a long deep breath gathering up her courage

She slips the bottles back into her pocket and exits

INT OPERATING THEATER - DAY

Klaatu lies in his bed exactly as he was when they left
Regina and Helen enter flanked by the two MPs

REGINA
I want to apologize It seems we got off
to a bad start

Rlaatu glances at the holstered 45s On the MPs hips

KLAATU
It seems we did

REGINA
These men are going to transport you to
another facility for better medical care

KLAATU
No theyre not

REGINA
Excuse me

KLAATU
Im leaving

REGINA
Im afraid thats impossible

She drops all pretense

REGINA (CONT’D)
This is a military installation You are
surrounded by hundreds of soldiers
Theres no leaving here

KLAATU
On the contrary I can leave whenever I
choose

(a beat)
You cannot control this

Losing her patience Regina steps back from the table

REGINA
Dr Benson if you please

Helen emerges from the shadows She juggles the ampules in
her pocket nervously and pulls one out --

- its the Glucose Solution She fills the syringe and
approaches the Being He makes no effort to resist She
spikes a vein injects the needle --

and as she slowly depresses the plunger Helen gazes into
his eyes to mouth a single silent word

HELEN
Run

Klaatu says nothing Then louder

HELEN (CONTD)
Hell be unconscious within twenty
minutes

GRANIER
We need to clear the room now His
immune system is still weak I dont
want to further expose him to our germs

REGINA
He should be watched at all times

solution is empty She wipes it down to remove fingerprints

and is about to place it in a sharps container on the wall --

She turns slipping the ampule back in her pocket

on it -- and soon it is perfectly steady

He looks up at the surveillance camera directly overhead He
gazes at it for a long moment --

- and the red light above the lens slowly begins to DIM

They walk out into the corridor scanning the empty rooms as
they pass Then --

- the overhead fluorescent lights begin to flicker
ominously

INT SICK WARDGENETICS LAB
Helen looks skyward and immediately senses whats happening

As the other scientists look up from their flickering
computer monitors she gathers her things to leave

INT ELEVATOR

Regina and Driscoll glance up at the flickering lights

The elevator lurches to a stop then goes dark
INT CORRIDOR

Helen runs down the corridor as one by one the fluorescent
lights above her flicker and die

INT CORRIDOR (ELEVATOR )
Silence The entire building has gone dark

Then suddenly a single tiny light goes on We PUSH IN on
it -- its the UP ARROW beside the elevator doors

Then as if heeding some unseen command the elevator doors
part The glowing elevator car stands before us waiting

INT CORRIDOR

The Guardsman flicks on his flashlight Its beam combs the
empty corridors searching Then Granier spots a tiny light
in the distance -- they race towards it --

- its the illuminated FLOOR NUMBERS over the elevator
Theyre descending now 8-7-6-5--0e

INT ELEVATOR

Regina flips open her cellphone casting some light in the

darkness They hear something passing close by -- an eerie
SQUEAKING the GRINDING of metal in the elevator shaft next
to them -- and Regina knows

Its him

The floor numbers descend 4-3-2-1 and then stop at B

INT BASEMENT

The entire group fans out through the basement level their
flashlights searching the darkness

INT HOSPITAL LAUNDRY

Granier quickly scans the room with his flashlight Hes
about to move on when he sees it --

- the wardrobe rack A row of dry-cleaned uniforms hangs
upon it spaced with military precision -- but theres one
uniform missing like a gap in a row of perfect teeth

The flashlights beam tilts -- to REVEAL an identical gap in
a row of shoes He turns and runs for the stairwell --

INT HOSPITAL -- GROUND FLOOR

Granier emerges from the stairwell onto the ground floor
All the doors leading outside are guarded by armed MPs

Suddenly the lights COME TO LIFE all around them

GUARD CAPTAIN
Weve got power --

Seal the main gate No one enters or
leaves

But Granier knows what this means

EXT NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE -— DAY

Eight lanes of traffic rumble endlessly beneath leaden skies
A light rain is coming down Someone steps into frame --

-—- its Klaatu He walks along the shoulder of the highway
Though he is pale and weak he walks at a steady pace his
eyes fixed on the distant horizon

Garbage is strewn along the side of the highway The
landscape is dotted with smokestacks and sewage treatment
plants A haze of car exhaust hangs over everything

Trucks rumble past airhorns BELLOWING towing trailers
packed with cows headed for the slaughter He marches
through this hostile landscape like a soldier caught behind
enemy lines

A GREYHOUND BUS THUNDERS PAST missing him by inches He
watches it slow in the distance peel off an exit ramp and
turn into a BUS STATION just off the freeway

INT GREYHOUND BUS STATION -- DAY

An old-fashioned flip-card signboard looms over the lobby
Klaatu scans the DEPARTING BUSES list --

-— and finds what hes looking for NEW YORKPORT AUTHORITY --
DELAYED Klaatu seems only mildly inconvenienced

Crowds of people sit on benches and the floor with their
bags waiting Theres already a sense of agitation in the
air as if a storm were coming

Klaatu heads for an old vending machine along the wall He
scans its contents then reaches out gently touching a
fingertip to the glass --

—- and the metal corkscrew within slowly begins to MOVE An
ancient plastic-wrapped sandwich tumbles into the bin below

He reaches in and pulls it out He turns and spots a LITTLE
BOY nearby with a perplexed look on his face he has
witnessed the whole thing

Klaatu goes to a bench and sits down He glances around the
bus station Two STATE TROOPERS stand near the ticket
counter A small crowd has gathered around a TV set behind
the counter --

-- which plays amateur VIDEO FOOTAGE of the Spheres landing
in Central Park Onscreen Klaatu emerges from the Sphere
is shot and collapses

He watches from his bench with a blank expression Only when
the radiation-suited figure -- Helen -- crouches over him
shielding him from further attack do his eyes betray a
momentary flicker of curiosity

He opens the sandwich carefully He eats it mechanically
without seeming to taste anything Then he glances down --

- and sees a spot on his shirt Its blood His wound has
reopened

He rises hides the blood beneath his lapel and heads for
the mens room passing the State Troopers as he enters

INT MENS ROOM

He pulls back his lapel to examine the spot of blood He
runs the faucet soaks some paper towels

He looks at himself in the mirror he is pale and sweaty He
grips the countertop tightly --

-- and collapses

INT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- DAY

Helen enters with Jacob behind her She triple-locks the
door behind them Jacob slinks off to the living room and

turns on the TV She walks into the kitchen --

-- to find the telephone receiver lying on the counter where
she left it the day before

TELEPHONE
please hang up and try again

She hangs up the phone She reaches into her pocket --
-- and pulls out the ampules

She places them on the countertop still unsure of what to do
with them

Jacob calls out from the next room

JACOB (0S)
So what did the cops want Mom

HELEN
They werent cops

JACOB (0S)
What were they then

HELEN
Ill tell you about it later

JACOB (0S)
Everybody thought you were in jail

HELEN
Dont be silly Jacob

Finally she makes her decision She sweeps the ampules into
the sink and turns on the garbage disposal A CRUNCH of
breaking glass and theyre gone She walks into

INT HELENS TOWNHOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY
She enters and looks at the bigscreen TV What she’ sees
leaves her speechless --

-- there for the thousandth time today they are airing the
footage of Klaatus arrival in Central Park

Suddenly it all comes flooding back to her
HELEN
My God It really happened
Helen stares dumbstruck Onscreen her radiation-suited
form holds fast to Klaatu shielding him from gunfire
They watch as onscreen the wounded Klaatu is whisked away
in the Medevac chopper The camera SWISH-PANS over -
- to where the fearsome Idol remains standing Waiting
Helen shivers with dread at the sight of it
JACOB
Were all gonna die
HELEN
No were not Everythings going to be
fine Come on Jacob Pack your things i
JACOB
Where are we going
HELEN
I dont know yet But weve got to get
out of here
She starts running up the stairs to pack Suddenly the

telephone RINGS She looks at it with dread

HELEN (CONTD)

He picks it up anyway

JACOB

He holds it out to her She reaches out and takes it

HELEN

Klaatu sits on a bench by the mens room with the two State
Troopers looming over him Helen sees them and hesitates for
a moment but shes already been spotted

She nods The Trooper motions toward Klaatu

STATE TROOPER (CONT’D)
We were going to call in the EMTs
but he kept asking for you Normally
wed have to take him in to the ER --

HELEN
Thank you officer but that wont be
necessary I can take it from here

The troopers walk off From here Helen can see her son in
the parking lot

She gazes at her child then looks at this strange being
standing next to her Then she looks away

thing I have to know Back at the

Are you a friend to us Or not

Klaatu stares into the distance as if distracted

KLAATU

Helen considers this a moment Finally she nods

He looks in the direction of the car Helen nods

INT HONDA CIVIC -- DAY

She puts the car in gear and pulls out of the parking lot

HELEN
Now what

He turns to face her

KLAATU
Turn left

She obeys

KLAATU (CONT’D)
Now just drive

Soon the road begins to open up before them Helen turns to
look at Klaatu He is pale and visibly weak

Helen glances in the rear-view mirror Jacob gazes out the
window listening to his earphones Helen speaks softly

HELEN
We need to get you to a doctor
KLAATU
That wont be necessary Look in your
pocket
(a beat)

Not that one The other one
She reaches into her coat pocket -- and pulls out one of the
test tubes filled with grey flesh that she took from the
operating theater
Klaatu reaches out his hand She gives it to him

He unbuttons his shirt revealing an ugly surgical scar
zigzagging across his chest

He uncorks the test tube and applies a bit of the gray pulp
to his fingers Then he rubs it into the scar

Instantly the scar begins to heal She watches amazed
He puts the stopper in the tube and offers it back to her

HELEN
I think youd better hang on to that

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

The road narrows The area is dark and remote Suddenly
Klaatu snaps to attention

KLAATU
This is it

HELEN
This is what

KLAATU
Pull over here

HELEN H
Here Theres nothing around for miles

He says nothing She hesitates a moment nervous where is
he taking them Finally she obeys

Klaatu climbs out He disappears into the woods Helen sits
there waiting

JACOB
Uh Mom Who is this guy
HELEN
Hes a friend from work
JACOB
What kind of friend from work is he
HELEN
Were just giving him a ride
JACOB
Why cant he rent a car
HELEN

HELEN

Were going to sit quietly for a couple
minutes No more questions All right

They sit in silence She watches the trees waiting Jacob
watches his mother closely Then

HELEN (CONT’D)
Wait here Dont unlock the door for
anybody but me Im serious

He nods She gets out and locks the doors behind her Then
she too vanishes into the woods

EXT WOODS -- NIGHT

She walks into the forest Shafts of moonlight penetrate the
canopy of branches overhead All she hears is the wind
through the pines Soon she hears another sound --

- a loud DRONING noise

She walks in the direction of the sound A fly buzzes in her
face She shoos it away --

-- only to find herself walking into a cloud of insects She
presses on through the swarm ——

-- until she reaches the edge of a great SWAMP In the
distance she sees Klaatu staring trance-like into its
waters A glow appears from below the surface

A riot of bubbles erupts as the light breaks the
surfaceand a Sphere twelve feet in diameter emerges from
the depths of the swamp Rivulets of water rush over its
surface as it rises

The Sphere moves toward Klaatu not rolling in contact with
the ground but floating Levitating He descends to meet it
at the waterline Klaatu shuts his eyes and touches the
sphere --

-- and the sphere begins to GLOW The waters surrounding the
Sphere suddenly teem with life Fish frogs all swimming
like sperm fighting to fertilize one enormous egg Insects
swarm around the sphere as if drawn to it

and as we ASCEND AWAY from the scene we see distinct
glowing points of light scattered across the landscape

EXT MOUNTAINS --— NIGHT

A FLOCK OF BIRDS suddenly changes direction -- soaring
past a stand of trees towards a FAINT GLOW amidst the trees
They descend toward the glow REVEALING a glowing sphere in
the snow

EXT DESERT -- NIGHT
great drifts of sand blow away REVEALING a sphere hidden

beneath the dunes sidewinders cut S-shaped paths in the
sand as they approach it

EXT CENTRAL PARK - OVERHEAD — NIGHT

and now we descend through the fog toward the immense
Sphere in the center of the park It too has begun to
GLOW

Helicopters of all kinds -- military police media -- hover
around it like curious insects

We descend through this swarm MOVING IN on the solitary form
of the Idol standing like a totem before it The rain
streams down its dark skin

An entire military apparatus has been set up around the Idol
with great banks of SODIUM LIGHTS to illuminate it from all
sides

track has been laid down on the ground surrounding it with
remote-controlled cranes holding great Titanium panels at the
ready

We TILT UP from the Idol to see the Sphere gently GLOWING in
the background

Now as if provoked by the activation of the Sphere we hear
them —-

- two Humvees rolling slowly toward the Idol from across the
park They roll to a stop fifty feet away

Soldiers stand in the rear M-60 gun turret of each vehicle
their weapons trained upon the Idol

A door opens in the second Humvee and two Kevlar-clad men
climb out -- a MARINE COLONEL and an NYPD BOMB SQUAD OFFICER
The Marine Colonel radios in an order -- —

-- and the cranes move in on the Idol their hydraulic arms
maneuver the Titanium panels into place One by one they bolt
them together boxing the Idol in

As the final panel is moved into place obscuring the Idols
face we

heads back

Someone knocks on the window Its Klaatu She unlocks the
passenger door and he gets in

I have to meet someone
HELEN

Meet who

He reaches over -- she flinches --

-- and he pulis something out of her hair Its a bee She
looks away embarrassed at having been caught spying She
puts the car in gear and begins to drive

Klaatu rolls down the window and carefully releases the bee
setting it free

They drive along the desolate two-lane blacktop Klaatu
gazes out the window In the distance a train rumbles past
loaded down with fuel-tanker cars

We are approaching the outskirts of a town Helen spots
something in the distance --

HELEN (CONT’D)
Oh God It’s starting

-- a discount store with its window smashed in

LOOTERS are handing boxes through the window loading up
trucks with supplies

JACOB
Why are they doing that

HELEN
Its OK Jacob Theyre just gathering

INT HONDA CIVIC MCDONALDS PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Klaatu points out the offramp it leads to a rest-stop
McDonalds

HELEN

He nods She shrugs and pulls into a parking space

In the backseat Jacob gazes at the long traffic jam of cars
fleeing the city He seems angry-

JACOB
Why are people running Shouldnt they
stay and fight

HELEN
They may not have come here to harm us

JACOB
We should kill them anyway just in case

Helen glances nervously at Klaatu

HELEN
You dont mean that

JACOB
Yes I do Thats what Dad would have
done

HELEN
I think he would have looked for another
way

JACOB

He would have fought

Helen falls silent She realizes that Klaatu is watching
them His expression is one of detached curiosity

The boy leans forward in his seat and looks at Klaatu

JACOB (CONT’D)
What do you think

KLAATU
Of what

JACOB
Do you think people should run or should
they fight

Klaatu turns and looks out the window at the cars on the
highway Helen listens closely

KLAATU
Neither

JACOB
What should we do then

KLAATU
Nothing

JACOB
Nothing

KLAATU

Theres nothing you can do
Helen stares at him Then

HELEN
Jacob Go inside and wait for us

The boy reluctantly climbs out of the car leaving them

alone
KLAATU
Tell me something Where is the boys

If you dont want to tell me thats

fine
Helen hesitates then

HELEN We

Klaatu turns and looks out the window

KLAATU (CONT’D)
So The boy wishes his father were here
to rescue the world from the aliens

lot of reasons The aliens being the
least of them

HELEN
What is this mission of yours Why did

He hesitates a moment He chooses his words carefully

KLAATU
I came to save the Earth

Helen stares at him a moment

HELEN
Save the Earth from what

Then Klaatu sees it --

KLAATU
Hes here

-- a TAXICAB pulls into the parking lot Klaatu climbs out
of the car Helen follows him determined to finish their
conversation --

-- but then the taxis rear door opens and a YOUNG CHINESE
MAN steps out He holds the door open --

-- and an 80-year-old man emerges from the taxi MR WU
walks with great difficulty using a cane

MR WU
Too cold outside We go inside

Mr Wu begins to shuffle his way to the McDonalds
INT MCDONALDS -- NIGHT
Mr Wu and Klaatu sit at a table by the window

Mr Wus grandson brings a styrofoam cup filled with hot
water and places it in front of his Grandfather He places a
tea bag into the water Then he goes to an empty table and
sits down waiting

Helen and Jacob sit nearby She leans over and whispers

HELEN
Do you speak English

WUS GRANDSON
Little English yes

HELEN
Are you one of them too

Wus grandson smiles blankly uncomprehending

wuS GRANDSON
One of who

Helen turns to look at Klaatu and Mr Wu trying to listen in
to their conversation

But to Helens surprise Klaatu speaks in fluent Mandarin
Chinese

KLAATU
(in Mandarin with English
subtitles)
I was worried you wouldnt be here
Youve been out of contact for a long
time

Mr Wu sets his tea bag aside
MR WU

I had a dangerous assignment This is
hostile territory

KLAATU
Ive noticed

Mr Wu clucks disapprovingly

MR WU
You should have been more careful You
might have spared yourself that bullet

KLAATU
I knew I was taking a risk I came here
as an envoy so that I could speak to
their leaders peacefully --

MR WU
They are not a peaceful race Ive lived
amongst them seventy years now I know
them well

KLAATU
And

Mr Wu hesitates a moment then
MR WU
I dont think theres any hope for them
Any attempt to reason with them would be
a waste of time

KLAATU
Is that your official report

He nods
MR WU
The tragedy is they know whats going to
become of them They sense it But they
cant seem to do anything about it

Its decided then

Klaatu rises slowly to his feet The meeting is over

MR WU
True But theres another side as well

He gestures at his grandson

MR WU (CONT’D)

You see I love them

Its a mystery to me too I cant t
explain it

He struggles to find the words

MR WU (CONT’D)

For years I cursed my luck at being sent

here Human life is hard And yet as

I feel so lucky to have lived it

His grandson helps him back into the taxicab He tells the
driver to take him back to the airport The taxi pulls away -

is parked by the side of the road She steps out and walks
toward the cornfield her face bathed in the otherworldly

Theres a RUSTLING sound through the field as the cornstalks
blow toward us propelled by some powerful wind The light

looms over us

We see its reflection in the cars window Inside Jacob is
oblivious as he listens to his iPod Then the sphere begins
to accelerate --

streak of light in its wake

HELEN

KLAATU

HELEN
You came to save the Earth

And then it dawns on her

HELEN (CONT’D)
from us You came to save the Earth
from us

Klaatu nods slowly

HELEN (CONT’D)
You said you were a friend

KLAATU
Im a friend to the Earth

HELEN
And were destroying the Earth So
youve come to destroy us first

KLAATU
This world is like no other There are
only a handful of planets in the cosmos
that are capable of supporting life at
all It cant be allowed to die

HELEN
But we can change We can still turn
things around

He shakes his head no

KLAATU
Weve watched and waited and hoped that
you would change But you did nothing
(a beat)
Now its reached the point of no return
We have to act

Helen takes a step back overwhelmed

KLAATU (CONT’D)
Well undo the damage youve done and
give the Earth a chance to begin again

HELEN
You dont have to do this We can
change if you just give us another
chance --

KLAATU
We cant risk the survival of an entire
os planet for the sake of one species

HELEN
But --

KLAATU
The decision is made Im sorry

Helen stares at him realizes He means it She takes a step
back eyes widening as panic floods her senses

A VIEW THROUGH A CAR WINDOW

Helen and Klaatu standing by the side of the highway as seen
in the headlights of a State Trooper car

Mounted to the young STATE TROOPERS dashboard is a laptop
computer on its screen are photographs of Helen and Klaatu
along with Helens license plate number

He spots a car pulled over by the side of the road and two
people talking beside it He flips on his high beams its
Helen and Klaatu He checks the license plate then pulls

over behind them

Helen sees the Trooper pull over She looks at Klaatu He
knows what shes thinking

KLAATU (CONTD)
You can tell him if you want to It
wont make any difference The process
is underway

The Trooper steps out of the car with his gun poised at them

TROOPER
Hands on the hood of the car
(re Jacob)
Is that a child in the car Get him out

Jacob emerges from the car

TROOPER (CONTD)
Both of you -- hands on the hood of the
car

Helen obeys Klaatu ignores him The Trooper cocks his
weapon raising his voice

TROOPER (CONTD)
All right Get down on the ground hands
behind your head

OF OF ee

Klaatu turns to look at him OVER THE TROOPERS SHOULDER we
see a distant pair of headlights approaching

KLAATU
Im going to reach out very slowly and
take your weapon from you Im not going
to hurt you

The Trooper stares at him The distant headlights grow
closer

TROOPER
I repeat get down on the ground

Klaatu ignores him He reaches out for the gun

TROOPER (CONTD)
This is your last warning

Klaatus hand reaches out slowly

TROOPER (CONT’D)
Keep your hands down or I will fire

The Trooper instinctively takes a step back Klaatu glances
past him at the approaching car --

-- and it goes into a STALL The car keeps rolling at high
speed -- the drivers steering wheel LOCKS —-

HELEN
Look out --

-- and we hear a THUMP as the Trooper is hit by the car
Helen clutches her child to her but hes already witnessed
the scene

The Trooper lies on the ground motionless The cars driver
climbs out looks at what hes done

DRIVER
My God --

Klaatu glances at the car and it comes back to life The
Driver looks at the car then looks at the scene

He climbs back into his car and drives away Klaatu watches
it all with a look of detachment

Helen looks up -- to see Klaatu turn and walk away back to
the Troopers car Helen calls out

e

HELEN
Where are you going

KLAATU
I have to get back to the city

HELEN
We cant leave him like this

KLAATU
You dont even know him

Helen just stares at him

HELEN
I believed in you I helped you And
this is what youve turned out to be --

We watch as any light of admiration she once had for Klaatu
goes out

She turns away crouching down to try to help the dying man

Klaatu turns and walks away He has almost reached the
Troopers car when he stops

He turns around and looks at the woman and the boy as they
desperately try to save the life of a man theyve never met
We PUSH IN ON HIM as he watches them

HELEN (CONTD)
Hes going to be OK Everythings going
to --

The boy is in shock

JACOB
No hes not OK Its not OK Nothings
OK

Tears start to roll down his face

JACOB (CONTD)
Hes going to die

HELEN
Hes not going to die

JACOB
Saying its OK doesnt change anything
Saying its OK wont bring him back to
life

OF

HELEN
What am I supposed to say

JACOB
Tell the truth

Helen hesitates The boy begins to cry even harder Helen
doesnt know what to do

Then Helen glances up --- to see Klaatu approaching He
speaks to the boy

KLAATU
Im going to let you in on a secret

The boy looks at Klaatu Helen rises to her feet Klaatu
crouches over the Trooper until hes out of frame --

KLAATU (CONT’D)
The Universe wastes nothing Nothing
ever truly dies Everything is simply
transformed

We PUSH IN on the boys face as he watches amazed --

-- as we HEAR the Trooper coughing offscreen taking deep
heaving breaths like a man saved from drowning

KLAATU (CONTD)
Talk to me Can you speak

The Troopers eyes open He speaks groggily

TROOPER
Think so

Klaatu helps him to his feet Leads him over to the Cruiser
by the side of the road and sits him down inside it The
Troopers wounds are already healing

As they load the Trooper into the car we hear urgent VOICES
on the Police Band in a state of high alert

HELEN
He radioed it in Theyll be coming for
us

Klaatu rises and looks at her

She stares at him for a long moment In the distance we hear
the faint approach of POLICE SIRENS

FF

HELEN (CONT’D)
I know a place we can go

INT PURGE CHAMBER FACILITY

A pair of heavy TITANIUM DOORS roll open before us and
Driscoll Reginas aide enters

INT PURGE CHAMBER CONTROL ROOM

A dimly-lit control room filled with engineers and military
brass Beyond a wall of thick synthetic glass stands a
brightly-lit PURGE CHAMBER with walls of blastproof tempered
titanium

Lying upon a slab inside the purge chamber is the Idol A
robotic arm equipped with a Diamond Saw looms over him

The Titanium doors roll shut behind us with a THUD We can
hear the heavy bolts slide into place sealing us in

COLONEL
Take your places Now that the

Undersecretary is here we can begin

Everyone takes their places -- including a young enlisted man
who sits down behind a button on the console marked PURGE

He flips back the Plexiglas shield that covers the button and
waits An Engineer nods to the Colonel Were ready

COLONEL (CONT’D)
Start the Diamond Saw

Inside the Purge chamber the diamond saw begins to spin up
A TECHNICIAN mans the robotic arm from within the control
Room

The Arm begins to descend toward the Idols dark carapace
Driscoll holds his breath as the Diamond Saw makes contact --

-- and nothing happens He exhales But the Saw cant seem
to penetrate the carapace It spins ever faster without
leaving a scratch

COLONEL (CONT’D)
Increase the pressure

The hydraulic arm bears down hard until we hear a high-
pitched WHINE from within the glass chamber

A burst of sparks and the Diamond Saw stops spinning The
Idols carapace is undamaged

TECHNICIAN
The rotors burned out

DRISCOLL
Fix it

They all look at Driscoll

TECHNICIAN
Somebodys going to have to go in there

COLONEL
Fix it Thats an order

And with that the assembled group moves into action
Driscoll is left alone at the center of it all fidgeting
anxiously with his security badge

CUT TO
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

Helens car kicks up a cloud of dust on the one-lane road
We turn at the old mailbox and suddenly the vista opens up --

EXT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- NIGHT

Helen and Klaatu step out of the car Jacob hangs behind
them watching Klaatu suspiciously

KLAATU
Whose house is this

HELEN
Someone who speaks your language

He looks at her surprised

Helen turns to look at Jacob - hes been eyeing Klaatu
warily the whole time

Helen falls back to speak with him as Klaatu walks to the
house The boy speaks in a whisper

JACOB
Mom --

HELEN
Its all right Jacob

JACOB
But back there with the cop how did
89 I

HELEN
Tll explain it later But right now I
just need you to trust me
JACOB
But theyre after him Who is he
HELEN
Hes the only one who can help us now
INT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
The doors to the deck overiooking the lake are open Klaatu
walks inside There is no one to be seen
The living room is like any other except that it is

dominated by a large blackboard on one wall covered with one
long mathematical equation

Klaatu approaches it He smiles

KLAATU
Close but no

He picks up an eraser and wipes out a few variables

HELEN
I wouldnt --

KLAATU
He wont mind j

Klaatu picks up a piece of chalk and begins to scrawl a new
line of variables on the board

We hear a WHIRRING sound from behind us Klaatu turns --

-- to see an old man in a motorized wheelchair in the
doorway -

PROFESSOR BARNHARDT gazes up at the blackboard amazed He
drives his wheelchair up to the blackboard --

-- and with trembling hand he begins to write his own
continuation Klaatu answers with another piece of the
equation

Soon the house is filled with the RAT-A-TAT of chalk on
blackboard A conversation only they can understand

Finally Barnhardt throws his wheelchair into reverse so that
he can take in the entire blackboard He is covered in chalk
dust

He gazes at the equation then at Klaatu He nods at the
newspaper on the table with its picture of the Sphere

BARNHARDT
Youre one of them arent you

Klaatu nods Barnhardt smiles

BARNHARDT (CONT’D)
I have so many questions for you

INTFORT MONMOUTH -- COMMANDANTS OFFICE --— NIGHT
An FBI AGENT blows into the room

FBI AGENT
Theyve been spotted Both of them
together A State Trooper found them

REGINA
Are they in custody

FBI AGENT
No maam We found him by the side of
the road cuffed to his cruiser by the
side of Highway 101 near Exit 86

Graniers eyes light up with recognition Regina spots this

REGINA
You know where shes headed

Granier is silent

REGINA (CONTD)
Please Dr Granier Think about the
implications of remaining silent It may
be the most important decision you ever
make

Granier hesitates Then reluctant

GRANIER
Hes an old professor of hers Of both
of ours actually
(a beat)
Isaac Barnhardt Hes a mathematician —-

REGINA
I know who Isaac Barnhardt is
(to the FBI Agent)
Go

INT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Helen Klaatu and Barnhardt sit by the fire Jacob slouches
on the sofa in the next room seemingly listening to his
headphones -- but he is listening to their conversation

BARNHARDT
So its irrevocable this decision

KLAATU
The process has already begun

BARNHARDT
But there has to be another way Youre
from an advanced civilization Surely
you could give us some technology that
would solve our problems

KLAATU
I could But every technology youve
ever discovered has been turned into a
weapon You know that better than
anyone Dr Barnhardt

He nods in the direction of an old BandW photo on the wall a
young Barnhardt stands next to a sign that reads LOS
ALAMOS

KLAATU (CONT’D)
I cant take that risk Were left with
no other choice but to deal with you
ourselves

Helen becomes angry

HELEN
What are you some kind of God Is the
universe some kind of garden where you
cultivate the flowers and pull up the
weeds

KLAATU
Something like that

BARNHARDT
What makes you think you know the
difference Do you think nature makes

mistakes
KLAATU
It seems it does
HELEN
And youre the one whose job it is to fix
them
KLAATU
Yes
HELEN

Thats just so human
INT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- LIBRARY - NIGHT

As Jacob listens the TV set plays images of the RUSSIAN
PREMIER at a press conference

RUSSIAN PREMIER
This is no longer a matter of American
security but the security of the entire
world The US acts as if it has
ownership of this being It must be
handed over to international
authorities

As the broadcast cuts to footage of Regina Jackson at a
contentious press conference at Fort Monmouth -

-- Jacobs gaze wanders into the next room where Helen and
Klaatu are arguing Slowly Jacob is putting it all
together

At that moment the music file on Barnhardts computer
changes playing an MP3 file of a Bach sonata

INT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Klaatu hears the music from the other room He cocks his
head for a moment listening to it

Klaatu wanders in from the other room drawn by the sound
Helen follows him

As Helen draws near she sees that Klaatus eyes are closed
Hes listening to the music transported

eee ee

OF

HELEN
Its Bach

Klaatu looks at her

KLAATU
I know

HELEN
Youve heard it before

KLAATU
Not like this Not with human ears

He touches the names embossed on the leatherbound books on
the shelves

KLAATU (CONT’D)
Its not just the worst of mankind that
we know Weve seen the best too

She stares at him her eyes widening Shes caught a glimpse

of something in him
HELEN
You could have let us die without knowing
anything But you told me Why
For a moment Klaatu doesnt answer And then

KLAATU
I dont know

HELEN
Maybe some part of you wants to be talked
out of this
He looks at her Shes right

HELEN (CONTD)
I dont think you really want to do it

Suddenly Klaatus face darkens

HELEN (CONT‘D)
Whats the matter --

MOVE IN on Klaatu hes heard something

94

EXT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- BACK PORCH - NIGHT

He throws open the doors Approaches the railing Gazes out
upon the moonlit lake

Then we hear it -- a distant BUZZING sound at first it
seems like the nighttime crickets in the forest

Then it grows louder more insistent We feel an eerie
breeze through the trees

HELEN
Whats going on here

Then just above the treeline a tiny STAR appears

KLAATU
Theyre here

Then another And another They twinkle amidst the other
stars in the firmament But these stars are growing bigger

At first it seems they are more spheres descending from the
heavens But as they Sweep over the lake Helen realizes
suddenly that these are

HELICOPTERS

a half-dozen of them each loaded down with Kevlar-clad
SOLDIERS Their predatory SEARCHLIGHTS bear down upon us

HELEN
Jacob --

She hurries back into the house to find her son

Klaatu stands on the deck motionless gazing serenely at the
helicopters that have come for him

One helicopter swings low attacking -- he closes his eyes
concentrates --

-- and the helicopters searchlight WINKS OUT as its power
fails It goes into a stall --

and falls out of the sky It splashes down in darkness
and disappears into the lake

One by one they fall out of the sky and vanish into the
lake Now the lead chopper moves in close too close

It sweeps down upon him attacking its engines ROARING -

- and suddenly it too goes dead
INT LAKESIDE HOUSE -- NIGHT

Helen races into the library to get Jacob The boy turns
glances out the floor-to-ceiling window --

and his eyes go wide Helen turns to see it

HER POV

as Klaatu takes cover REVEALING the helicopter tumbling
headlong toward us -- and then it hits

FLAMES

fill the screen then recede The house has been reduced to
a burning impact crater At its heart is the wreck of the
helicopter We MOVE through the smoke and flame --

-- to find Helen amidst the debris Shes alive

HELEN
Jacob --

She climbs to her feet and begins to search through the
wreckage Then she sees it -- a body Its Barnhardt Hes
dead Her panic rises

HELEN (CONTD)
Jacob

And then she finds him She picks him up and carries him
coughing through the broken doorframe of the house to
safety She inspects her child then embraces him

HELEN (CONT’D)
Thank God youre all right

She rises Then Helen sees Klaatu She re-enters the house
and drags his body clear of the flames She crouches over
his body holding his head in her lap desperate to revive
him --

-- and then he begins to COUGH from smoke inhalation Tears
run down his face His eyes open focus --

-- on Helens face above his
Klaatu looks at her as if hes never seen her before or

never in quite this way He looks back at the fire and
realizes what shes done

OF

Helen rises and scans the area for Jacob Hes gone She
hurries off in the direction we last saw the boy running
leaving Klaatu behind She begins to run -—-

HELEN (CONT‘D)
Jacob

- and then a pair of Kevlar-clad arms grab her around the
midsection The soldier holds her as theyre hoisted aloft
on a fast rope --

INT HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

--until they land in the cargo bay of the sole remaining
helicopter The soldier releases her and unclamps his
harness from the engine-powered fast-rope Helen looks
around desperate

HELEN
My son --

The choppers searchlight scours the landscape for the
missing boy but hes vanished into the forest The
searchlight passes over the place where Helen left Klaatu
but he too is gone

Other helicopters drop rope-lines so that soldiers can
descend The soldiers fan out across the area searching the
forest for Klaatu and the boy

The Extraction Team Leader makes a circular gesture with his
finger signaling that they should bring Helen back to base

EXT FOREST -- NIGHT

Klaatu makes his way through the woods ‘The distant glow of
the burning lake house gradually fades behind him He moves
quickly as if following his own internal compass

Then from off in the trees we hear a sound Klaatu breaks
step for a moment then continues on

Another rustling through the trees Somethings out there
It hovers in the shadows tracking him Klaatu hesitates

momentarily unsettled -- and then it comes at him
THE BOY
raises a heavy stone bringing it down -- he slams Klaatu

grunting from the sheer effort of it --

ee OF

e EH

-- and then finally the boy drops the stone and falls to
his knees spent

Klaatu absently touches the place on his chest where the
stone struck him The boys attack has come to nothing
Klaatu turns on his heel to walk away --

-- and the boy lunges after him clawing at his ankles
desperate Klaatu just keeps walking Finally the boy has
nothing left and Klaatu slips away

Then Klaatu stops Turns He looks at the boy crouching on
the ground The child looks up

JACOB
Its you Youre one of them

KLAATU
You should go back to the house and wait
for the fire trucks to come

JACOB
Im going to stop you

Klaatu turns and walks on leaving the boy behind He moves
at a fast clip through the woods focused only on his unseen
goal Then he stops Turns --

-- and the boy is a few paces behind him

KLAATU
-Turn back

JACOB
Im not afraid of you

KLAATU
You should be

He turns and moves on faster now He climbs the steep hill
like an automaton clearing every obstacle without breaking
step Finally winded he stops Turns --

-- and the boy is still standing a few paces behind him
Klaatu turns and walks on

KLAATU (CONT’D)
If you fall and hurt yourself Im going
to leave you to die

JACOB
Thanks I11 do the same for you

Klaatu walks on and the boy follows him into the dark

INT PURGE CHAMBER CONTROL ROOM

Driscoll and the Colonel watch as a MASTER TECHNICIAN dressed
in a Hazmat suit approaches the airlock that leads inside the
Purge Chamber

The man casts an anxious glance at the Colonel The Colonel
nods the airlock opens and the Technician walks inside

The assembled military engineers look on from behind glass as
the Technician nervously approaches the Idol on the table and
goes to work on the robotic arm above it

Behind the console the Technicians hand hovers over the
PURGE button ready to press it at a moments notice

INT PURGE CHAMBER

As the Technician repairs the Robotic Arm he notices
something on the tip of the Diamond Saw He reaches out with
a razorblade and scrapes it off --

-- there dancing on the razors edge is a tiny insect-like
creature almost like an aphid

AS he puts it aside and finishes his work we PUSH IN on

THE RAZORBLADE

And we see that it is not an organism but a tiny machine --
and that it is devouring the razorblade as an insect would a

leaf

The Technician closes the panel door on the Robotic Arm and
radios back

TECHNICIAN
Thats it Shes up and running

He quickly gathers his tools and returns to the airlock door

COLONEL (0S)
Hold it Your sleeve

Then we see it a tiny HOLE in the sleeve of the Technicians
suit Its growing

The Technician covers the hole with his glove -- but soon
another hole appears on his back Its as if his suit is
slowly being devoured by unseen insects

INT PURGE CHAMBER CONTROL ROOM

Driscoll the Colonel and the engineers watch with mounting
alarm as the Technician desperately tries to cover the holes
in his suit He begins pounding on the airlock door

TECHNICIAN (0S)
Let me out

Even as he speaks we see his nose begin to bleed
Somethings happening to him Someone reaches out for the
airlock door release --

COLONEL
No

The Colonel remains motionless behind the console watching
as his man inside pounds on the airlock door

DRISCOLL
Its spreading

The Colonel watches as the Technician inside the chamber
falis to his knees dying

DRISCOLL (CONT’D)
We have to purge

COLONEL
We have our orders

DRISCOLL
Im ordering you to kill it Purge now

COLONEL
(ignoring him)
Start the diamond saw

The diamond saw begins to spin up again Driscolls anxiety
mounts The Private at the Purge button turns to look at the
Colonel

PRIVATE
Sir hes dying in there

COLONEL
Theres nothing we can do for him now

Now we see something else taking place inside the chamber --

-- the glass that separates them from the Idol is slowly
being eaten away much like the Technicians suit

DRISCOLL
The glass -- Its getting out

COLONEL
Finish the job Thats an order

We can hear the SCREAMS of the Technician inside The
Private at the button cant take it

PRIVATE
Put him out of his misery at least

DRISCOLL
If you wont do it then --

Finally he can endure it no longer He reaches out —--

-- and hits the PURGE button

AN EXPLOSIVE BLAST

Fills the screen before us The Purge chamber is filled with
billowing ROARING 1800-degree flame as blinding as the
heart of the sun

Their faces are cast aglow by the light of the flame The
heat even behind glass is unbearable Then gradually the
flames recede

-- and we see that nothing remains but the Idol They stand

there in dumbfounded silence Everything else -- the
Technician even the Diamond Saw -- has all been consumed by
the Purge

Then to their amazement the Idol rises from the slab
unfolding its limbs

We hear the high-pitched teeming sound from within it The
explosion has done little more than rouse the Idol from its
slumber And once again it is angry

Driscoll backs away from the glass terrified He watches as
the Idol positions itself --

DRISCOLL (CONTD)
Whats it doing --

- and begins to split open releasing millions of aphid-like
creatures from within

e eH e

Soon the chamber is filled with the swarm As it begins to
devour the glass before them Driscoll runs to the titanium
doors hits the RELEASE button —-

-- but it wont open He turns to the Colonel who just
shakes his head

COLONEL
This floor has been sealed No one
leaves

Now the Robots entire body decomposes away dissolving into
a teeming cloud of insects

The swarm continues to devour the glass that separates them --
until finally it bursts through swarming the control room --

- and in a last-ditch attempt to stop them the Colonel hits
the PURGE button once again

Both the Purge chamber and the Control Room are instantly
filled with flame incinerating everyone inside -

-- but when the flames are gone the swarm is all that
remains

We stay with this locust storm as it eats through the very
walls of the lab itself chewing through duct work
insulation concrete --

EXT ROBOTICS DEFENSE LAB - NIGHT

-- and bursts through into daylight It spreads out across
the sky and takes flight --

-- and now we turn and gaze down upon what the locust storm
has wrought a great hole has been eaten in the defense lab
itself Half the building is gone All that is left is the
distant CLICKING of millions of wings

CUT TO
EXT FOREST -- NIGHT

Klaatu marches through the forest The boy follows doggedly
examining him from a distance

JACOB
So Alien Where did you come from

Klaatu says nothing

FH

JACOB (CONT’D)
Are there more of you on the way

Klaatu ignores him

JACOB (CONTD)
What do you want from us

KLAATU
I want you to be quiet

They walk in silence a moment Then

JACOB
Were going to stop you you know

KLAATU
No you arent

JACOB
What makes you so sure Because you
think youre some kind of supreme being

KLAATU
Not supreme Just superior

Klaatu walks on The boy looks annoyed

JACOB
Is everybody on your world as ugly as
you

KLAATU
Uglier

The boy is suddenly intrigued

JACOB
Really

KLAATU
Yes

JACOB

So how do you have sex Are you like
some sort of cockroach race or --

Klaatu cocks his head He hears something We hear almost
imperceptibly the sound of BARKING

KLAATU
Dogs Theyre searching for us

Klaatu rises and presses on The boy follows close behind

In the distance beyond the next rise we see lights moving
through the trees -- cars passing down a country highway
Klaatu makes his way toward the road --

-- but theres a rushing stream blocking the way A fallen
tree forms a bridge over the stream

Jacob climbs out onto the tree and begins to cross Klaatu
follows him Then as theyre making the crossing Jacobs
footing slips --

and Klaatu reaches out and catches the boys jacket He
holds him steady until the boy can regain his footing The
boy calls out over his shoulder

JACOB
Thanks

And then he carries on Klaatu stands there a moment gazing
at the hand hes just used to intercede in the life of a
human being

Then he too carries on across the fallen tree until he
reaches the other side

A lonely two-lane blacktop stretches unto the horizon A
single EIGHTEEN-WHEEL TRUCK barrels past us

INT EIGHTEEN-WHEELER -- NIGHT

The truckdriver listens to talk radio as he drives He is on
the verge of drifting off to sleep The truck begins to list
off towards the shoulder Then something wakes him up --

-- its his radio A HIGH-PITCHED STATIC is suddenly heard
on the AM band He swerves back into his lane shakes
himself awake and turns off the radio

But the high-pitched noise continues If anything its
getting louder as if its gaining on us

EXT HIGHWAY NIGHT

We speed along the blacktop following the distant red
taillights of the truck Then we recognize the sound —-

-- its the CLICKING of millions of locust wings
INT EIGHTEEN-WHEELER -- NIGHT

The truckdriver notices something on his windshield Seems
its a bug He hits the winshield wipers and sweeps it away

EXT HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

The swarm pulls into frame enveloping us like a metallic
cloud As it devours the very highway beneath us it creeps
up on the speeding eighteen-wheeler --

-- and then engulfs it In a matter of seconds the swarm
DEVOURS the truck while its still moving --

-- and then it and the highway it was driving upon are
gone leaving nothing but bare earth in its wake

And as we PULL BACK we see that as it rumbles up the
highway the swarm grows larger It grows into a great cloud
on the horizon a terrible storm gathering force —--

and as it blows past a highway sign with an arrow beneath it
reading NEW YORK -- ALL LANES we

CUT TO
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT
Klaatu and Jacob emerge from the woods onto the road The
barking of the dogs is growing louder closer Then they see
it --
-- in the distance stands a mailbox An old Ford pickup
truck is parked beside it Klaatu approaches the pickup and
touches it with his hand --
-- and the engine STARTS Its headlights come to life
Klaatu climbs in and slides behind the wheel Jacob climbs
in beside him

Regina watches it all somberly from the head of the table

REGINA

posted outside the doorway

Granier appears in the doorway with a plate of food He
walks inside and sits down next to her She doesnt look at
him

GRANIER
Im sorry Helen

HELEN
Then help me stop this

GRANIER
Do you really think thats possible

HELEN
Yes Ido I think he wants to give us
a chance But he cant if they get to him
before we do

Granier absorbs this for a moment then abruptly blurts out
to both Helen and her Sentry

GRANIER
Both of you -- come with me
EXT SICK WARDGENETICS LAB -- ENTRY -- NIGHT

They approach the main entry for the lab

SENTRY

GRANIER

Then wait here Well be out ina

moment

Granier sweeps his keycard leading Helen inside

eee

INT SICK WARDGENETICS LAB -- NIGHT
Granier walks Helen through the lab
GRANIER
Do you have any idea where the two of
them might have gone

Helen seems hesitant

GRANIER (CONT’D)
Im trying to help you Helen

She pulls out her cellphone
HELEN

I got a message from Jacob on my

voicemail I know where they are
Granier leads her out the rear exit to
EXT MOTOR POOL -- NIGHT
A line of blacked-out government SUVs is parked nearby
Granier approaches one of them climbs in and opens the
passenger door for Helen

GRANIER
Get in

INT PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
Klaatu drives The boy is wide-eyed with anticipation

KLAATU
I dont have much time

JACOB
We wont stay long

Klaatu is reluctant Finally he nods

JACOB (CONT’D)
Pull over up here

EXT STREET -- NIGHT

Klaatu pulls over by the side of the road The boy climbs

out They approach a wrought-iron fence

JACOB
Give me a leg up OK

Klaatu helps the boy over the fence Then he climbs over as
well They move through the trees which open up into a vast
open field revealing

HEADSTONES

hundreds of them in evenly spaced rows each decorated with
a tiny American flag

EXT VETERANS MEMORIAL CEMETERY -- NIGHT

Jacob wanders from row to row seemingly lost Klaatu
follows him

Finally the boy finds what hes looking for He kneels down
and carefully sweeps the dust from the face of the
gravestone Then he steps away

Klaatu steps forward and reads the inscription on the stone
LIEUTENANT ANDREW BENSON -- 1972-2005

Klaatu turns to look at Jacob the boy gazes up at him
expectantly He stands well clear of the grave giving
Klaatu plenty of room to work his magic

But Klaatu just shakes his head

JACOB
You can do this Like with the Trooper

KLAATU
There are some things I cant do

JACOB
But you have powers

Klaatu shakes his head

KLAATU
Im sorry

The boy gazes down at his fathers grave

JACOB
It isnt fair

KLAATU
No It isnt

The boy falls silent Then

JACOB
Can I be alone

Klaatu turns to leave

JACOB (CONTD)
Dont look OK

KLAATU
OK

Klaatu turns and walks away He walks until the headstones
abruptly end From here it is all open green lawn

cuT TO
JACOB

standing by his fathers grave his head down He trembles
with a thousand barely contained emotions

Then a HAND reaches down from out of frame and gently touches
him on the shoulder He looks up --

-- its Helen The boy instinctively turns and embraces her
and the floodgates open

JACOB
He left me alone

HELEN
Youre not alone And he didnt leave
you I see him in you all the time So
much that sometimes its too much for me

to bear
JACOB
I know You miss him too
HELEN
Its all right Jacob Everythings all

right --
A moment then Helen finally says it

HELEN (CONT’D)
No Its not all right I want to make
it all right but I cant I want to
protect you from everything thats
happened but I dont have that power I
dont know what to say to make it better

ee FF FF

JACOB
You dont have to say anything

We PUSH IN ON KLAATU watching them from a distance
Somewhere in him a human soul is stirring

Helen whispers a few words into her sons ear He dries his
eyes Klaatu approaches them Helen looks up

HELEN
(to Jacob)
Jacob wait for us in the truck Well
be there in a minute

Jacob turns and heads off leaving them alone
Helen gazes down at her dead husbands headstone

HELEN (CONTD)
On the morning my husband was killed he
was building a hospital He was pointing
at the place where an I-beam was supposed
to go when a snipers bullet entered his
skull --

She touches her temple

HELEN (CONT’D)

-- right here right beneath his Kevlar
helmet He died instantly or at least
thats what they told me They said it
was like the bullet just fell out of the
sky

(a beat)
I watched that scene in my head over and
over in the past year imagining all the
things that could have been different if
he hadnt been pointing in that
direction if his helmet had been tilted
at a slightly different angle if the
whole chain of events that led us to that
place in the desert had been different

(a beat)
And little by little I just lost it
Lost my faith in everything There could
be no higher order in a world like that
only chaos And soon that was all I had
left to believe in

She rises to her feet

He

i
i

HELEN (CONTD)
Until now Now I see that those dominoes
fell in such a way as to lead me back
here to my husbands grave with you
And I dont think it was an accident I
believe again

She looks up at him her eyes alight

HELEN (CONTD)
I believe we can change this path were
on I believe its not too late The
question is do you believe in us

KLAATU
I want to believe

HELEN
Then take a leap of faith Help us

Then off in the distance he sees that Granier is
approaching Klaatu reacts

HELEN (CONT’D)
Its all right Hes here to help

Klaatu eyes him warily Then in the distance he hears
something --

-- the faint mechanical clicking of the swarm The others
dont know what it means but he does

HELEN (CONT‘D)
What is it

KLAATU
Theyve attacked it The swarm has been
released

HELEN
What does that mean

Klaatu turns to look at her
KLAATU
It means theyve made my choice for me
Its out of my hands now

HELEN
There must be something you can do

KLAATU
I can take you away from here
HELEN °
Where
KLAATU
Home My home

Helen shakes her head

HELEN
This is our home Were not leaving
(beat)
We belong to the Earth You cant take
us away from it
Klaatu nods
KLAATU
I see that now
i
HELEN
There must be some way to stop this
Klaatu hesitates
KLAATU
It would come at a price

HELEN
What price
Klaatu doesnt answer
KLAATU ie
I need to get back to the city Now

cuT TO
A GOVERNMENT SUV

as it enters the Lincoln Tunnel The inbound lane is empty
they are the only ones driving into Manhattan

INT SUV - LINCOLN TUNNEL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Darkness envelops them as they roll through the dimly-lit
tunnel Helen and Jacob lie flat in the back seat Nervous
waiting

GRANIER
Get ready

Between the seats we see LIGHT at the end of the tunnel
And a company of waiting National Guardsmen

EXT LINCOLN TUNNEL EXIT PLAZA — MANHATTAN - NIGHT

A GUARDSMAN CAPTAIN waves the Humvee to a stop Walking
alongside he looks into the SUVs tinted glass He doesnt
see anyone in the back

He examines Graniers credentials then glances at the man in
uniform seated beside him Klaatu glances out the window
All the Guard sees are the Captains bars on Klaatus sleeve

The soldier salutes waves them throughand the Humvee
mounts the ramp to street level

INT COMMANDANTS OFFICE -- NIGHT

Regina stands gazing out her window Helens Sentry stands
behind her

The strain of the last 24 hours shows on her face She seems
uncertain ambivalent

AIDE (0S)
Madame Secretary were ready for you

INT COMMANDANTS OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM -- NIGHT
Regina sits before a teleconference camera A light goes on
above the camera and her uncertainty falls away replaced by
the mask of the consummate professional She speaks directly
to us
REGINA

Mr President General I believe we

may soon have a target of opportunity
INT SUV -- NIGHT
The streets are near-empty the city has been abandoned
They drive in silence occasionally taking nervous glances
out the window Armed SOLDIERS line the streets watching
suspiciously
EXT WEST SIDE CHECKPOINT -- NIGHT
They halt before the barricades roll down the window again

The GUARDSMAN LIEUTENANT who approaches and peers inside
seems more suspicious than the last one

ee

To distract him from looking at Klaatu too closely

GRANIER
Were with the advance team We have
orders from the General

The Lieutenant looks at Graniers ID tag

GUARDSMAN LIEUTENANT
Wait here Ill check with my command

A tense moment as the Lieutenant returns to his guardstation

GRANIER
He may be onto us

Granier reaches for the gearshift ready to put the SUV in
reverse -- when Klaatu stops him

The Lieutenant eyes the guards manning the barricades and
waves a hand

GUARDSMAN LIEUTENANT
Let ‘em through

The guards part to let the SUV through and its occupants
quietly let out a breath They roll into motion again

As the Lieutenant watches them pass he reaches for his
walkie

GUARDSMAN LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
This is Lt Omar at the West Side
checkpoint Theyre headed your way

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST -- 79TH STREET ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

All the military vehicles that were once stationed around the
Sphere have been pulled back to 79th Street sealing off the
park Granier is starting to panic

GRANIER
He recognized us Im sure of it They
know were coming Theyre going to be
waiting for us

As the SUV approaches the barricades that lead into the park
a CORDON OF SOLDIERS blocks the entrance

GRANIER (CONTD)
Get your heads down --

i

Re
i

Klaatu Helen and Jacob duck as Granier speeds toward the
checkpoint -- and the line of soldiers parts

The SUV BLOWS THROUGH the barricades speeding onto
EXT CENTRAL PARK DRIVE SOUTH -- NIGHT

The SUV races down the winding drive toward the Great Lawn
Now through the trees we glimpse it in the distance --

-- the Sphere illuminated by dozens of Klieg lights
Granier glances in the rear-view

HUMVEES

are pursuing them and gaining fast Then almost
inexplicably --

-- the Humvees SLOW DOWN

GRANIER
Theyre stopping --

The Humvees begin to recede in Graniers rear-view mirror
and then we leave them behind entirely We pull around a
stand of trees -- ‘

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- GREAT LAWN -- NIGHT

-- to reveal that the Great Lawn is empty of military
vehicles and personnel All that remains is the Sphere
itself

Granier pulls over and they climb out of the SUV The
silence is almost eerie

HELEN
Where is everybody

Granier just shakes his head They begin to walk across the
lawn toward the sphere in the distance Klaatu stops
Granier
¢
KLAATU
Not you Just them

Granier nods and returns to the SUV Klaatu leads them
across the lawn

-- the clicking of mechanical wings

Klaatu looks around and realizes the aphids are everywhere
The grass the trees They seem to be waiting for something

HELEN
What do we do

KLAATU
Keep walking toward the Sphere Youll
be safe there

They walk on through the grass Klaatu casts his gaze
skyward a cloud of them looms above the city spreading
itself against the sky Then Helen hears it --

-- a strange high-pitched WHISTLE seemingly coming from the
Sphere itself Faint but unmistakable

JACOB
What is it

KLAATU
I dont know

The sound grows louder more distinct -- its almost like a
teakettle on the boil -- soon it becomes a SHRIEK - Helen
starts putting it together --

HELEN
They cleared the area

-- and suddenly Helen realizes what it is

HELEN (CONT’D)
Run --

The three of them break into a run for the sphere just as
A FLIGHT OF F-16S

passes directly overhead They release a fusillade of
targeted missiles The missiles fall through the air in
perfect silence and then

A GREAT FIREBALL

blooms before us filling the entire screen Granier
standing by the SUV watches wide-eyed as the curtain of

flame begins to recede --

-- REVEALING the Great Sphere standing intact undamaged by
the blast

INT THE SPHERE -- PORTAL

Helen and Jacob huddle just inside the Spheres glowing
portal watching as waves of flame roll by just outside

Now as the flames begin to subside they hear another sound -
- the CLICKING of millions of wings

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- GREAT LAWN -- NIGHT
Klaatu emerges from the portal walking outside --
THE SWARM

Surrounds the Sphere It begins to rise swirling around the
sphere gradually expanding picking up speed until it
becomes a great hurricane It expands further until it
fills the park --

-- and then it reaches the buildings that surrounds the park
The swarm consumes everything -- devouring the very facades
of the buildings that surround the park until they etart to
crumble and fall away

As the storm expands through the city entire buildings begin
to collapse Soon everything that man has made will be
consumed

Klaatu stands there in the eye of the hurricane gazing out
at the destruction The hurricane is expanding through the
city Everywhere the human race is dying

Then he acts He steps out onto the Great Lawn into the
thick metallic fog -- he reaches out his hand toward the
great Sphere --

-- and the Sphere begins to glow to come to life It seems
to tap into Klaatus own power to amplify it a thousandfold -

-- and soon the city streetlights around him begin to flicker
and fade

EXT MANHATTAN -- OVERHEAD -- NIGHT

The entire glowing grid of New York begins to shut down

The darkness spreads in waves away from the city and across
the seaboard Now we pull back further back into the great

locust cloud --

-- and we hear the clicking of mechanical wings begin to
falter All around the world the machines are dying

OF

EXT SAN FRANCISCO -- NIGHT

The lights of the Golden Gate bridge begin to dim

EXT TOKYO -- DAY

The glowing lights of the Roppongi district flicker and fade
EXT LONDON -- OVERHEAD -- DAY

The traffic in the City center gradually grinds to a halt
EXT ATMOSPHERE -- NIGHT

The great metallic clouds gather themselves summoning the
strength of their numbers -—-

EXT CENTRAL PARK —- NIGHT

- and then they attack millions of them descending upon him
from out of the sky bearing down on him in a great funnel
cloud battering his defenses --

-- but then they begin to fall away ‘The tiny machines lie
on the ground at his feet dying

But some penetrate his defenses Even as they fall from the
sky like a metallic rain we see his silhouetted form as he
falls to his knees

The swarm gathers itself around him It descends making its
final attack - he reaches out his hand summoning all his
powers --

-- and collapses

EXT CENTRAL PARK --— DAWN

The storm is over The ground is covered with a thick
metallic ash that is all that remains of the swarm

The crumbling towers that surround the Park have all gone
dark Everything is silent more silent than this noisy city
has ever been

They rise and begin to search for Klaatu Then they find
him --

Klaatu lies where he fell dead The boy turns away
embracing his mother

She gazes down at Klaatus body in repose We CRANE BACK to
gaze down upon them from above

KLAATU (VO)
I am leaving you Please forgive me if I
speak bluntly

EXT TIMES SQUARE - DAWN

The signboards are dark now The square is packed with cars
but everything is perfectly still and silent Crowds of
people stream out of buildings into the streets

KLAATU (V0O)
Your machines are still now but this is
only temporary If you choose to you
can rebuild your society the way it was

EXT EASTERN SEABOARD -- DAWN

The cities of the world have gone dark All that is left is
Earths own luminosity

KLAATU (V0O)
But if you do if you go on living as you
did your planet will die and you will
die with it

EXT BERLIN -- EVENING

A great traffic jam has gone still People climb out of their
cars and begin walking

KLAATU (VO)
Or theres another choice you can
transform and build a new civilization

EXT SHANGHAI -- NIGHT
The factories on the horizon have all gone still
KLAATU

Life is a force that adapts and
transforms itself when faced with
impossible challenges Ive seen you do
this I know what you are capable of

EXT DELHI -- EVENING

People flood the streets lighting candles against the
darkness

KLAATU
You can develop new technologies and
give up the wasteful things that held you
back

EXT MANHATTAN -- OVERHEAD -- DAWN
Thousands of people stream into Central Park

KLAATU
But you must not wait another day There
will be no more warnings This is your
last chance

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- DAWN

Helen and Jacob gaze down at Klaatus body The smoke
continues to drift away --

KLAATU (VO)
Up until now the human race has been in
its infancy The time has come to take
your first step

- and the sun begins to break through For the first time
we hear the sound of birdsong from the trees around us

KLAATU (CONTD)
The choice is yours What happens next
is up to you

Helen clutches her son to her as the sun breaks through the
clouds at last
