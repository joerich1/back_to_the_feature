sounding name

EVAN

EVAN (CONTD)
Look at those nipples

SETH
Theyre like baby toes

EVAN
Its not fair I have to hide every
erection I get

SETH
Sometimes I get boners so big I cant
hide them And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding and it all just
like feeds my boner It just becomes
thisthingthats attached to me And
it wont go away

EVAN
Just imagine if girls werent weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see ‘em like this shit

SETH
You know its been like a year anda
half since Ive seen an actual human
female nipple Besides my moms I saw it
last month and it was sick

EVAN
Holy shit Liat was two years ago I
guess so She was insanely hot though

SETH
Exactly Too hot Thats what sucks

EVAN
How can that possibly suck Id be
fuckin psyched if Id gotten with a girl
that hot You got like two dozen
handjobs

SETH
And three quarters of a blowjob But that
was fuckin it It was the peak of my ass-
gettin career and it happened way way
way too early

EVAN
Youre like Orson Welles 5
SETH
Exactly If Id built up to it Id
probably at least be having steady sex
with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point I honestly now see why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death

EVAN
Youll have sex in college Everyone
does And if not youll have the Bang
Bus

SETH
But the key is to be good at sex by the
time youre in college You dont want
girls to think you suck dick at fucking

EVAN
I still think youve got a chance with
Jules She got mad hot over last summer
and clearly hasnt realized it ‘cause
she still flirts with you

SETH
Are you joking man Lets see hereshe
dated Dan Remick Matt Muir Josh Corber
and whats-his-face All of those were
cool guys Shes been hot way longer than
you think Why would she end her high
school career with me

EVAN
Well Helen got with Ariel Shafir

SETH
Yeah and he was a complete fucking
loser Youre a step up from that Which
is why you should stop being a pussy and
do her You could nailthe shit out of
her for like two months before you
leave That bitch looks like a good
fucker

EVAN

Evan starts to walk out Seth follows

Jules pulls Seth away Evan and Helen start walking in the
opposite direction

As they walk away from one another Seth and Evan look back
and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave
A SLOW GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY They look as
though theyre never going to see each other again

INT MACYS ESCALATOR
151 151

As Jules and Seth walk into Macys and Helen and Evan descend
an escalator the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome
crescendo and we humbly fade to black

childhood They are hilarious
