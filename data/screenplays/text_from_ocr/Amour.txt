AMOUR

Michael Haneke
SCENE 1 - INT APARTMENT - DAY

The hallway is a mess A window opening onto a light well is
open

The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open A plain-
clothes detective two uniformed police officers and several
firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around They all
wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses
Behind them the superintendent and his wife also push their
way in They’re both holding their noses In his free hand
the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
flyers Behind him comes a female neighbor

PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
(to the superintendent and the
neighbor)
Wait Outside please

He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
onlookers back out through the door

POLICE OFFICER
(to the superintendent pointing to
a pile of mail)
What’s the date of the last letter

SUPERINTENDENT
(verifying)
The 16th from what I can see
Wait

The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
door on the left It has been sealed up with adhesive tape

PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
(to the fire officer)
Can you try

While the firemen go to work on the door the plain-clothes
detective goes into the adjoining dining room He opens the
windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
the double doors They are locked and the gaps are also taped
up He turns to the right and goes into the living room
where he also opens up the windows

FIREMAN (0S)
The door is open

-and comes back into the hallway passing by the waiting
firemen Once again we hear snatches of dialogue between the
police officer and the janitor
JANITOR
no as far as I know During the
whole time they had a nurse but
it’s been a while since I last saw
her My wife has been

The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
accessible Its windows are open and the draft makes the
curtains billow into the room

PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
(to the firemen who are now curious
enough to come and stand by the
door )
Did you open the windows

The firemen shake their heads

The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
placed against the back wall of the bedroom On the right-
hand bed there’s only the bare mattress On the left-hand
bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman Where
once there were eyes now there are only gaping holes The
corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
that have already dried out a little On her chest is a
crucifix

SCENE 2 - White letters on a black background THE CREDITS

SCENE 3 - INT CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

All we see is the audience pouring into the hall GEORGES and
ANNE both are around eighty are part of this crowd They go
to their seats in one of the rows near the front Once
everybody is seated we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
people to turn off their mobile phones Some people caught
with their phones switched on hasten to comply Then the
lights go out APPLAUSE

Off-screen we hear the soloist make his entrance THROATS
ARE CLEARED here and there Finally the MUSIC begins
SCENE 4 - INT ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The music from Scene 3 continues The soloist is surrounded
by admirers who congratulate him

Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room (If the
soloist is female they will be carrying flowers like most
of the others)
When the soloist notices their presence he leaves his group
of fans heads towards them and greets them very warmly
visibly glad to see them

SCENE 5 - INT BUS - NIGHT
Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3

Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
bus Anne talks enthusiastically Georges says something from
time to time and smiles now and then They are both relaxed
and happy

SCENE 6 - INT APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
outside THE MUSIC ENDS

Georges comes in turns on the light He and Anne observe the
open door Around the lock one can see the traces of an
attempted forced entry

Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
grooves

GEORGES
They used a screwdriver or
something like thatit doesn’t
look very professional

ANNE
But who would do something like
that

GEORGES

No idea Why do people break in
Because they want to steal
something

ANNE
From us

GEORGES
(laughs briefly out loud)
Hey why not If I thought about
it I could come up with at least
three or four people we know who’ve
been burgled

After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
double door he comes in closing the door behind him
ANNE
What time is it Can’t we call the
superintendent

GEORGES
I’1l1 do that tomorrow morning
Anyway they didn’t see anything

He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
in the hallway

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Don’t let it spoil your good mood
now

ANNE
Or the police

GEORGES
Come on give me your coat

She goes toward him he takes her coat off and hangs it with
his in the closet

ANNE
Imagine if we were here in our
beds and someone broke in

GEORGES
Why should I imagine that
ANNE
But it’s terrible I think I’d die
of fright
GEORGES
(laughing)
So would I

He undoes his shoes

GEORGES (CONTD)
Shall we have a drink

ANNE
I’m tired

GEORGES
I still fancy a drink

He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his
slippers Anne has gone into the bathroom
ANNE (0S)

Go ahead then Mathilde told me
that in her building the attic
apartment was burgled from the
loft They just knocked a hole in
the wall cut out all of the
valuable pictures from their frames
and disappeared without a trace

He goes toward the kitchen

GEORGES
They must have been professionals

As he passes in front of the bathroom he stops and appears
to be looking at Anne

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Did I tell you you looked good
tonight

SHORT PAUSE THEN

ANNE (0S)
(Flattered)
What’s got into you

With a gentle LAUGH Georges disappears into the kitchen
where he turns on the lights We hear him FIDDLING AROUND
apparently getting a glass and some wine After a short
PAUSE

ANNE (CONTD)
Weren’t those semiquavers in the
presto incredible What staccato
Don’t you agree

Short PAUSE

GEORGES (0S)
Youre proud of him huh

SCENE 7 - INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Georges wakes up He looks with amazement beside him then
raises his eyes Anne is sitting upright her back against

the headboard

GEORGES (CONTD)
Something wrong

ANNE
No
After a while the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to
the next scene

SCENE 8 - INT KITCHEN - DAY
The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS

Georges is seated in front of the window at a table which is
half set for breakfast He has mobile phone raised to his ear
and a phone book opened in front of him Anne is getting up
from the table She goes toward the stove turns off the gas
takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
cold water Like Georges she is still in her robe

GEORGES
(on the phone)
What about next week No but still
it would make sense to get it done
soon It might give people silly
ideas And anyway it’s too ugly to
look at Wednesday What time
OK Will you bring the paint with
you too to paint over it But at
least some primerYes OK Thank
you

He hangs up

GEORGES (CONT’D)
(to Anne)
You can depend on that guy

ANNE
(who comes back to the table with
the egg) I hope so The last time
he kept us waiting for ages if you
remember

GEORGES
(laughs while acquiescing)
Yes that’s true (Reacting when
she places the egg in his egg cup)
Thanks If I call a regular
professional we’1ll still be
waiting two months time

ANNE
(more to herself)
Really

She has sat down Looks straight ahead He cracks open his
egg puts salt on it eats
GEORGES
The Frodons waited three days when
their toilet was blocked Not
exactly pleasant

He eats Wants to put on more salt but the saltcellar is
empty

GEORGES (CONTD)
The saltcellar is empty

He looks up for an instant as if he expected her to deal
with it As she doesn’t react he realizes the

inappropriateness of such an expectation gets up himself
heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar

GEORGES (CONTD)
I don’t know if he’s going to bring
us the CD Maybe he won’t come at
all In any case he didn’t mention
it I’d like to buy it It was
really good and I don’t want to
wait long for it We could go to
Virgin this afternoon and buy it
What do you say

He comes back to the table and sits down again

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Hmmm Anne What’s the matter

She looks at him and doesn’t answer

GEORGES (CONT’D)
What’s going on What’s the matter

He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Helllloooo Cuckoo I’m here

She continues to look at him without reacting

GEORGES (CONTD)
(serious now) Anne What’s going
on

He waits looks at her No reaction He stands up slightly
leans over the table to sit beside her Tries to make her
turn toward him

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Anne what’s the matter
He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him but
her eyes look through him

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Annewhat’s

He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Anne

She stares into the void He drops his hands Then sits
beside her for quite awhile

SILENCE

Finally he gets up heads for the sink turns on the tap
wets a tea towel wrings it out a little comes back and
places it on Anne’s face Waits for a reaction that doesn’t
come Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
applies the cloth there Then sits down and looks at her
imploringly

GEORGES (CONTD)
(close to tears)
AnneDarlingplease

Once again they both remain seated In the background we
hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
forgotten to turn it off

Making a sudden decision he gets up rapidly crossing the
hallway he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
agitatedly which takes him quite a lot of time Suddenly
the GUSHING of the tap stops which had accompanied us as far
as the bedroom

George doesn’t notice it immediately then he stops short

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Anne

Finally he returns half dressed into the kitchen
Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him

ANNE
What are you doing

She turns toward the breakfast

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
You left the water running
Georges stares at her

GEORGES
(both aghast and furious)
Hey what’s going on Are you
completely crazy Is this supposed
to be a joke or what’s going on

She looks at him with amazement

ANNE
What did you say

GEORGES
(seriously)
Is this a joke Is this meant to be
a joke

ANNE
What joke I don’t get it Why are
you talking to me like that What’s
got into you

Georges comes from the door to the table

GEORGES
Anne Please Stop this game It’s
not funny

ANNE
(getting irritated)
What game for Christ’s sake What
on earth’s the matter

Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone
but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken He
tries to calm down takes his chair that has remained beside
Anne sits down and looks at his wife She doesn’t know how
to react

GEORGES
What’s the matter Why didn’t you
react

ANNE
To what

GEORGES

To what To me to everything

ANNE
When

GEORGES
Just now A moment ago

ANNE
Please tell me what’s wrong What
am I supposed to have done

Georges first looks away reluctantly then looks at Anne He
doesn’t want to believe that its serious

GEORGES
I don’t know what to say Do you
really not know what just happened

ANNE
But what DID happen

GEORGES
(almost reluctantly bowing his head
as he speaks) You were sitting
there staring at me You didn’t
answer me when I asked you what the
matter was

He picks up the wet tea towel from the table

GEORGES (CONTD)
I put this tea towel on your face
and you didn’t react

Anne looks at the towel then at Georges and shakes her
head perturbed that she can’t understand Georges looks at
her He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Look There’s still dampness on
your collar

Anne follows his gesture tugs on her collar and sees the
damp marks She slowly grasps that something is awry

ANNE
When When was it
GEORGES
Just now a few minutes ago
ANNE
So
GEORGES

There’s no “So” I went into the
bedroom to get dressed I wanted to
get help
SILENCE

PAUSE

PAUSE

ANNE
Help

GEORGES
Yes and then you turned off the
tap

ANNE

Yes Because you left it on

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
I don’t understand

GEORGES
Neither do I

GEORGES (CONTD)
Don’t you think it’s best if I call
Dr Bertier

ANNE
Why What can he do
GEORGES
I don’t know Examine you
ANNE
I’m fine There’s nothing wrong
with me
GEORGES

Anne please That’s absurd We
can’t pretend that nothing
happened

ANNE
But what DID happen

ANNE (CONTD)
I’m here I’m having my breakfast
and you’re telling me things
happened that I don’t understand

GEORGES
Can you explain how the tea towel
got there

ANNE
(irritated)
No I can’t

GEORGES
Who turned on the tap

ANNE
You did

GEORGES
Can you remember that

ANNE
(more and more desperate close to
tears) No I can’t Do you want to
torture me Leave me in peace

Georges looks at her

GEORGES
Don’t you think it would be better
to fetch Dr Bertier

ANNE
No

She takes her cup of tea as if to show how well she is and
drinks it up When she wants to re-fill her cup she
completely misses her aim She notices it puts down her cup
and bursts into tears

SCENE 9 - INT APARTMENT - NIGHT
SILENCE

We see wide shots of the apartment The hallway The bedroom
The living room The dining room The kitchen Nobody in
sight

SCENE 10 - INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
EVA around 50 has come to pay a visit Anne isn’t there

EVA
You know how he is Once he’s got
something into his head he has to
go through with it In the end
everybody was delighted And
besides it didn’t hurt our
financial situation We’re playing
until the 28th

(MORE)
EVA (CONTD)
Then we have 10 days to rest then
we go to Stockholm for four days
and then to Kumo in Finland Heaven
knows where that is At the North
Pole But Geoff’s already been
there few times and he loves it
Were playing the “Dowland
Transcriptions” there and then
were back in London

GEORGES
What about the children

EVA
Liz is at boarding school and John
is living his own life He’s twenty-
six years old

GEORGES
What does he do

EVA
He’s a student We rarely see him
He’s got his own ideas Life Geoff
They don’t really get along Geoff
wants to advise him on everything
and John doesn’t like that at all

GEORGES
Is he good

EVA
I think so He’s less impulsive
Very industrious

GEORGES
That sounds rather derogatory

EVA
No He’s not like Geoff Quiet
but stubborn I think he’1l1 do all
right At the last Conservatory
concert he played the solo part in
the Haydn Concerto It was very
good Geoff was there and
congratulated him at the end

Brief PAUSE

GEORGES
And you

EVA
What do you mean

GEORGES
Did you both make up

EVA
(with a little laugh)
My God you know him don’t you
Over the winter he suddenly
discovered his passion for a viola
player who’d been in our ensemble
for years What can I tell you It
was a huge drama and the poor
little darling wound up trying to
commit suicide That scared him and
he came back to me in full remorse
I’ve got used to it now What’s a
bit embarrassing is that the
ensemble you can’t keep any
secrets from anyone

GEORGES
Do you love him

EVA
Yes I think so

Brief PAUSE

EVA (CONTD)
What’s aphasia

Georges gestures that it’s too complicated

He yawns

GEORGES
What can I say The carotid artery
was blocked They did an ultrasound
scan two in fact and they said
they had to operate on her She was
scared She was confused and
scared You know she has always
been afraid of doctors They said
the risk was very low and that if
they didn’t operate she’d be
certain to have a serious stroke

EVA
And what do they say now

GEORGES
Just that it didn’t go well It’s
one of the 5 that go wrong

GEORGES (CONTD)
It’s pretty upsetting

He looks at his watch

PAUSE

PAUSE

GEORGES (CONTD)
Usually at this time I take a nap
My blood sugar is somewhere down in
my socks

EVA
I’m so sorry

GEORGES
Yeah

EVA

What can I do for you

GEORGES
Nothing It was nice of you to come
despite all of your stress

Brief PAUSE

She doesn’t know what to say

PAUSE

GEORGES (CONT’D)
No really There’s nothing you can
do We’ll see how things go when
she’s back here in the apartment
Well manage Maybe I’ll geta
caretaker in or maybe I’1l manage
on my own We’ll see We’ve been
through quite a lot in our time
your mother and I
(little laugh)
All this is still a bit new

EVA
(with a little laugh)
It’s funny I don’t know if I
should say it Maybe it’1l
embarrass you But when I came here
a short while ago I suddenly
remembered how I always used to
listen to the two of you making
love when I was little

(MORE)

EVA (CONTD)
For me at the time it was
reassuring It gave me a feeling
that you loved each other and that
wed always be together

SCENE 11 - INT BEDROOM - DAY

A carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the
double bed Georges watches

SCENE 12 - INT HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The door of the apartment is opened Georges comes in Behind
him is Anne in a wheelchair pushed by a paramedic A second
paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and
a large bag Behind them the superintendent

Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible He
stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first
paramedic

GEORGES
Here Thank you very much It’s for
both of you You can just put the
things down here There beside the
window right We’ll be okay on our
own Thanks a lot

The two paramedics exchange a brief glance say thanks and
leave the apartment passing the superintendent as they go

GEORGES (CONTD)
(to the superintendent)
Thank you Mr Mery

SUPERINTENDENT
If you need anything just call
downstairs If we can help at
all

GEORGES
Right now everything’s fine I’1l
let your wife know as soon as we
need anything

SUPERINTENDENT
(to Anne)
It’s nice to have you back Mrs
Laurent

ANNE
Yes Thank you Mr Mery Thank
you

The superintendent hesitates another moment

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
Yes thanks

SUPERINTENDENT
Yes So Goodbye then ma’am
Welcome home again Goodbye Sir

GEORGES
Goodbye Mr Mery

SUPERINTENDENT
Goodbye

He leaves the apartment
There is a brief moment of perplexity Then Georges says

GEORGES
(with a nervous smile)
Where do you want

ANNE
In the living room

Georges pushes her toward the living room door walks around
the wheelchair opens the door comes back behind the
wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM

The doorway is narrow The wheelchair only just passes
through it Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the
armchairs and then steps in front of her

GEORGES
Shall I make some tea

ANNE
(with a faint smile)
First come sit with me

George registers her smile he knows he’s behaving in a
clumsy way He sits down in one of the two arm chairs

ANNE (CONTD)
Can you help me into the chair

Georges stands back up
GEORGES

(eagerly)
Of course

He extends his hands She puts on the wheelchair brake lifts
the footrest with her left foot raises her right leg from
the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
to Georges

ANNE
It’s best if you put my arm around
your neck and your right arm around
me that way it’1ll be easy

He does as he is told pulls her up as they hobble together
the short distance to the second arm chair Cautiously he

lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight Because
they are not used to it the whole process appears awkward

and clumsy

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
Thanks

He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer “Don’t
mention it” Then he sits down opposite her

LONG PAUSE

At first they are both ill at ease but then they accept the
fact that words do not come easily After a long while
during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC
below

GEORGES
(softly almost to himself)
I’m glad you’re back

ANNE
(in a voice just as soft)
Me too

Another PAUSE Then Anne says

ANNE (CONTD)
Promise me one thing

GEORGES
What
ANNE

hospital

Nothing Just don’t say anything

PAUSE
SCENE 13 - INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
He helps her into bed then throws the blanket over her

GEORGES
There

ANNE
Thank you Thank you Darling

GEORGES
Everything OK

ANNE
(smiling)
Everything’s fine

He hesitates

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
You don’t have to hold my hand all
the time now I can look after
myself you know

He nods

ANNE (CONTD)
And don’t feel guilty That would
be pointless And a drag For me
too

GEORGES
I don’t feel guilty

ANNE
That’s good

She smiles

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
Go over there now I’m not a
cripple You can easily leave me
alone for two minutes I won’t
collapse

GEORGES
(with a slight smile)
OK

ANNE
Did you buy the new book on
Harnoncourt

GEORGES
I’ve already read it

ANNE
And

GEORGES
Do you want it Ill get it for
you

ANNE
Sure

He goes out of the room to fetch the book She remains lying
there waiting and runs her healthy left hand through her
hair to make herself look prettier then smooths out the
blanket that has slipped out of place a little After a
while we hear Georges shouting

GEORGES (0S)
I don’t know where I put it

ANNE
Don’t worry It isn’t that
important

GEORGES (0S)
Yes it is Hold on maybe it’s in
the Just a moment Viola Here
you are Nothing like an infallible
memory

She smiles looks in his direction He enters with the book
in his hand

GEORGES (CONTD)
I thought I’d left it over there in
the other room but I’d already put
it away Tidy people just can’t
help being tidy

ANNE
(taking the book)
Thanks

She puts the book on her stomach Looks at Georges

ANNE (CONTD)
Right now take care of yourself
And don’t wait to see how I hold
the book in my hand OK

GEORGES
OK

He looks at her for a moment longer then leaves the bedroom
She waits till he’s outside Tries to relax Then she
remembers the book She takes it in her left hand and tries
to open it It’s not easy for her

Then she notices that she’s forgotten her glasses She rests
the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
the night stand In the end she manages it Then she opens
the book again and tries to read

SCENE 14 - INT KITCHEN - DAY
The superintendent’s wife puts the filled supermarket bags on
the counter Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top
of one of the bags and puts it down beside them Then she
takes out the receipt and the change

SUPERINTENDANT’S WIFE

SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE (CONT’D)

He nods she closes the door as she leaves
SCENE 15 - INT HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY

He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet waiting
After a while we hear the noise of flushing After a while
longer we hear

ANNE (0S)
There Can you come in please

He opens the toilet door goes around Anne pulls her up she
puts her left arm around his neck keeps herself upright that
way he pulls up her pants under her skirt Then they slowly
hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the
wheelchair

SCENE 16 - INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

They are both lying in their beds Anne sleeps BREATHING
NOISILY Georges lies with his eyes open listening
attentively to her breathing

SCENE 17 - INT KITCHEN - DAY

The sun shines in Georges has cooked something simple They
are both in a good mood eating and drinking

GEORGES
some banal romance or other

about a nobleman and a lower middle-
class girl who couldn’t have each
other and who then out of sheer
Magnanimity decide to renounce
their love - in fact I dont quite
remember it any more In any case
afterwards I was thoroughly
distraught and it took me a bit of
time to calm down In the courtyard
of the house where grandma lived
there was a young guy at the window
who asked me where I’d been He was
a couple of years older than me a
braggart who of course really
impressed me “To the movies” I
said because I was proud that my
grandma had given me the money to
go all alone to the cinema

(MORE)

GEORGES (CONTD)
“What did you see” I started to
tell him the story of the movie
and as I did all the emotion came
back I didnt want to cry in front
of the boy but it was impossible
there I was crying out loud in the
courtyard and I told him the whole
drama to the bitter end

ANNE
So How did he react

GEORGES
No idea He probably found it
amusing I dont remember I dont
remember the film either But I
remember the feeling That I was
ashamed of crying but that telling
him the story made all my feelings
and tears come back almost more
powerfully than when I was actually
watching the film and that I just
couldnt stop

She looks at him smiles then turns back to her food

ANNE
Thats cute Why didnt you ever
tell me before

GEORGES
There are still a few stories you
dont know

ANNE
Aha Don’t tell me you’re going
to ruin your image in your old age

GEORGES
(grinning)
You bet I won’t But what is my
image

She takes a mouthful eats ponderously Then she looks at
him

ANNE
(tenderly)
Sometimes you’re a rotter But
youre nice

GEORGES
(embarrassed grin)
Can I take you for a drink

She laughs
SCENE 18 - INT HALLWAY - DAY

He does physiotherapy exercises with her Counts the
repetitive movements of the exercises

SCENE 19 - INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

She’s lying on the sofa He’s seated in the armchair They’re
both reading the newspaper After a while

ANNE
Listen to this My horoscope
Motto You have lots of verve but
need to be more serious
Love High-class conversation is
what you need
Work You’re motivated again But
proceed with care
Health Loosen up by doing
exercises It’ll give you renewed
pizzazz

PAUSE Then

GEORGES
(good-humored)
Youve only yourself to blame if
you read stuff like that

Brief PAUSE Then

GEORGES (CONTD)
Tomorrow afternoon is Pierres
funeral

ANNE
You have to go

GEORGES
I fear I must I dont want to go
at all

ANNE
Who does like going to funerals

GEORGES
Oh I know a few people who do
Annette can never wait to get all
dolled up again And Francois
has

ANNE
Youre mean What would you say if
no one came to your funeral

GEORGES
(dryly) Nothing presumably

She shoots him a glance smiles at his irony Then she says

ANNE
Have you talked to Jeanne since I
was in the hospital I mean does
she know I can’t come

GEORGES
Of course
ANNE
What did she say
GEORGES
She was shocked
ANNE
How
GEORGES

(a bit irritated)

My God what are people like when
theyre shocked She couldn’t
believe it she was speechless I
dont remember any more In any
case not exactly I’ve spoken to a
lot of people since

PAUSE

ANNE
Sorry

GEORGES
No Im sorry I didnt mean to be
unkind but I just don’t see the
point of talking about it all the
time

Short PAUSE

ANNE
Do I talk about it all the time

GEORGES
No Sorry

ANNE
Dont worry

SCENE 20 - INT HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The front door is unlocked from the outside and Georges
enters He’s back from the funeral dressed for the occasion
He turns on the light He’s wet Clearly it’s been raining
As he closes the door again his eyes fall on Anne With her
back to him she is sitting on the floor in front of the
opened window of the light well half propped against her
wheelchair

GEORGES
What

Shaken he heads toward her picks her up and seats her in
the wheelchair Outside in the light well it is raining

PAUSE
ANNE
(once she’s seated in the
wheelchair)
Why are you back already What time
is it
PAUSE

Georges has understood immediately He closes the window
noiselessly

Then just stands there at a loss
SILENCE Then
ANNE (CONTD)
(softly)

Forgive me I was too slow

GEORGES
Anne

ANNE
Can you wheel me into the living
room

PAUSE

GEORGES
Yes

He turns toward her pushes the wheelchair into the living
room between the two armchairs Turns on the light Stops
beside the switch They both look exhausted

GEORGES (CONTD)
Youre always good at surprises

ANNE
Yes Why are you home earlier

GEORGES
I didnt come home earlier I took
a taxi In August there isn’t a
lot of traffic

ANNE
That’s true How was the funeral
GEORGES
Anne
ANNE

How was it go on tell me

He thinks an instant then goes and sits down facing her in
an armchair Looks at her She raises her head and returns
his look He understands that he cant insist right now Long
PAUSE Then he begins

GEORGES
It was rather bizarre The priest
was an idiot Then one of Pierre’s
co-workers made a speech that was
embarrassingly emotional His old
secretary came with a radio-
cassette player and after the
speech she put on “Yesterday” by
the Beatles You can’t imagine
Everybody turned round to look at
her Apparently it wasn’t planned
His grandchildren were there Of
course they giggled as soon as the
music began Then the urn was put
on a huge stretcher that was
obviously designed for a coffin
and out we went into the rain They
placed the urn on a small electric
cart that crawled along for what
seemed like an eternity to the tiny
hole they had dug A lot of people
had to stifle their laughter It
must have been terrible for Jeanne
I have

ANNE
(interrupting him)
There’s just no point in going on
living I know it can only get
worse Why should I inflict it on
us On you and me

GEORGES
Youre not inflicting anything on
me

ANNE

You don’t have to lie Georges
PAUSE

GEORGES
Imagine you were me Didnt you
ever think something like this
could happen to one of us

ANNE
Of course I did But imagination
and reality have little in common

GEORGES
But things are getting better every
day Well
ANNE

(interrupting him)

Georges I dont want to carry on
You’re making such efforts to make
everything easier for me But I
dont want to go on For my own
sake Not yours

GEORGES
I dont believe you I know you
You think you’re a burden on me
But what if things were the other
way around What would you do then

ANNE
I dont know I cant be bothered
to think about being you I’m
tired You tire me Everything
tires me I can’t talk I want to
go to bed

He looks at her Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair
out of frame

SCENE 21 - INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

She is lying in bed The bedside lamp is on

We hear the RADIO coming from the living room a program
about the fauna and flora of the South Seas or something
similar

SCENE 22 - INT HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door On
the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from Scenes
3 and 4

GEORGES
(somewhat perplexed but pleased)
Oh hello Nice to see you

SOLOIST
Forgive me for dropping in on you
like this Professor I tried to
reach you by phone a couple of
times but no luck

GEORGES
I’m sorry I only pick up the phone
when I’ve stored the callers
number and I can see whos calling
Why didnt you leave a message
Anyway do come in

He closes the door behind his guest

SOLOIST
I just couldn’t manage to come by
after the concert I was so sorry
because I was so pleased you came
along

GEORGES
Come with me

While they pass into the living room they continue to speak

SOLOIST
- And now an unexpected

opportunity has arisen because
Frangois Mitry called me - you know
him he’s my agent - to say hed
arranged for me to meet the boss of
the Théatre des Champs-Elysées
tonight to talk about their new
concert series

(MORE)

SOLOIST (CONTD)
So I flew to Paris this morning
and while I was in my hotel I
thought Ill just give it a try
and drop in After all its
virtually just around the corner

Sorry these are for your wife

He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and
hands it to Georges

SOLOIST (CONT’D)
Isnt she at home

GEORGES
Yes she is I’1l go and get her in
a minute Have a seat

SOLOIST
I hope I’m not disturbing you too
much
GEORGES

No not at all I’m happy that you
came We were so thrilled by your
concert We hoped we’d see you
again soon Please do have a seat
Can I can get you something A cup
of tea

SOLOIST
No no thank you very much

GEORGES
Hold on I’1l just freshen up the
flowers in this heat they wilt so
fast

SOLOIST
Ive only just bought them They
should keep quite

But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
closed the door behind him The soloist looks around him

After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in
the distance without understanding what they’re saying It
lasts a while

Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne in her
wheelchair into the living room

ANNE
Martin What a delight How lovely
to see you

The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesnt quite
know how to handle the situation

SOLOIST
Mrs Laurent Lovely to see you
too
ANNE

Dont get up Come on sit yourself
down and dont look so shocked

The soloist sits down hesitantly Georges pushes the
wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down
Brief embarrassed PAUSE

ANNE (CONT’‘D)
I’m so proud of you We were both
in raptures after your concert
Georges wanted to buy your new CD
the very next morning

SOLOIST
Oh God I wanted to bring you the
CD but I left in such a hurry that
I forgot it I’m so sorry I’ll get
one today and drop it by

ANNE
(smiling)
No no dont worry We want to
make a contribution to your
success Even if it’s only twenty
euros

SOLOIST
Youve already contributed so much
I owe you so much Madame

ANNE
You owe it to your hard work and
your talent

SOLOIST
(shaking his head a little) Do you
remember when you first gave me
the Bagatelles to play I was
twelve at the time and in my
youthful arrogance I said “But why
the Bagatelles” And you really
gave me a piece of your mind
They both smile PAUSE Then he goes on

SOLOIST (CONT’D)
So what happened

ANNE
My right side is paralyzed that’s
all It can happen when you get
older

SOLOIST
And how

ANNE
Lets talk about something else
shall we

SOLOIST
(disconcerted)
Sure
ANNE

Don’t be offended But I want to
enjoy the lovely interlude youve
given us with your visit

SOLOIST
(disarmed)
Of course
Brief PAUSE
GEORGES

You havent told us yet whats been
going on since the Paris concert

The soloist is a bit thrown by the couple’s behavior

SOLOIST
Well actually Ive spent most of
the time in London studying Then I
went to Copenhagen for two
performances that was Schubert
too My whole life revolves around
Schubert at the moment The
concerts with the Impromptus and
the Moments Musicaux and for my
bread-and-butter work Im
developing the sonatas Not the
late ones I think I still need a
couple more years for those

(The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to
the performer chosen)

ANNE
Could you do me a favor

SOLOIST
(surprised)
Really

ANNE
Would you play Fiir Elise

SOLOIST
(embarrassed)
Um I don’t know if I remember it
very well Beethoven it’s been a
long time since I’ve But if you
want

ANNE
Give it a try

SOLOIST
(hesitantly)
OK

He looks at Georges then at Anne again gets up goes to the

breaking Stifled CRY from Anne Georges gets up irritated
crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM

Anne lies on the floor beside the overturned night stand in
the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal

GEORGES
(shocked and hence furious)
Good God what are you doing

He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into
the bed

GEORGES (CONTD)
Have you lost your senses I dont
believe it How stupid

He points to the broken objects

GEORGES (CONTD)
Look at that Did you need to do

him

ANNE
Georges What’s going on Who is
it

Georges opens the door Outside however instead of the
usual landing we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
a window about as large as the rooms in the apartment It
looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment A couple of
ladders are propped against the opposite wall At the other
end of the room to the side is a small door Georges is
stunned and doesnt understand what has happened
Hesitating he crosses the room toward the door

OS in the distance Anne’s worried voice

ANNE (CONT’D)
Georges What’s going on

Georges opens the small door Behind it is a narrow
windowless corridor as brightly lit as the room At the end
of the corridor a door Georges heads toward this door and
opens it too Behind it is a tiny windowless room equally
bright as the others Everything is very quiet Georges
enters turns round then goes back along the corridor
crosses the room comes through the apartment door into the
hallway of the apartment But it too is now empty and bright
with bare unpainted walls no doors only the door to the
bedroom is open Behind that too it appears to be empty and
bright Georges goes toward it

At the same time we hear GEORGES VOICE At first he groans
but then begins inarticulately hollering louder and louder
Shortly after we also hear

ANNES VOICE
Georges whats going on

SCENE 29 - INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Darkness GEORGES HOLLERS

ANNES VOICE
Calm down will you Theres nothing

She manages to switch on the bedside lamp Georges is sitting
up in his bed having just awoken wide-eyed with terror His
breathing is labored

Anne extends her good hand toward him caresses his back to
calm him He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow

ANNE
What was it

him

GEORGES

her improvement She reacts like someone duty-bound but
without conviction

SCENE 32 - INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

begins (the concert heard in Scene 3) Georges takes a card
out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to
Anne

GEORGES

sad to see you My heartfelt wishes
that things will get better
With deep gratitude your former

SILENT

this request

ANNE (CONTD)

He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room He comes
back after a few moments with a stack of albums pushes away
the remains of Annes meal and sets down the first album in
front of her

Brief PAUSE

GEORGES
Hold on

He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room

GEORGES (CONT’D)
I’1l be right back

During this time she remains seated feeling embarrassed
and waits He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat
of the wheelchair

GEORGES (CONTD)
It’s no big deal Come on

He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes
her through the hallway into the bathroom

He lifts her out of the wheelchair sits her on the stool and
takes off her wet nightgown pulling it over her head She
starts to SOB inconsolably He caresses her face

GEORGES (CONTD)
Come on darling It’s nothing
serious Things like that happen

ANNE
(sobbing)
I can’t take it any more

He holds her tightly against him strokes her hair feeling
helpless

GEORGES
My love My darling

SCENE 36 - INT BEDROOM - DAY

Anne is in bed She’s on a drip Eva is seated on a chair
beside the bed

EVA
thinking about whether it
wouldn’t be better to invest the
money in an apartment block If
inflation gets going again
property is the only sure thing
Right now savings accounts pay
175 at best Four years ago
Geoff bought some stocks with a
small sum of money and the whole
thing collapsed So now we’re
obviously worried Unfortunately
in the meantime other people have
had the same idea and property
prices are going through the roof
Since we came back from
Scandinavia I spend all my spare
time looking through newspaper ads

To put an end to the PAUSE that follows she adds
EVA (CONTD)

It takes time that’s all We’1l
find something in the end

Another oppressive PAUSE

ANNE
(slowly) Yes yes I have I
have the grandmother woman
with house not the house then
money

EVA
I dont understand you Im afraid

ANNE
e yes now it’s all house
sel sel sel was in two
strokes of so quickly god
it’s hard to say sell
money gone left there too

PAUSE Eva has tears in her eyes
SCENE 37 - INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Georges and Evas husband GEOFF around fifty He speaks
with a British accent

GEORGES
three times a week I’m not
experienced enough We’ll see if
that’s enough

GEOFF
How much is she asking
GEORGES
It’s paid by the hour We’ll see
GEOFF
And her
GEORGES
Anne

Geoff nods Georges shrugs

GEORGES (CONTD)
It’s hard to say Sometimes I get
the feeling she’s totally unaware
of the state she’s in And then I
feel the opposite It’s I dont
know

GEOFF
And what about the doctor What
does he say

GEORGES
Hes

Eva comes in through the door She’s in floods of tears

EVA
(crying)
She only talks gibberish I dont
know what

Geoff gets up hesitantly

GEOFF
Hey dear

He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was
sitting

GEOFF (CONT’D)
come here sit down its OK

She shakes him off irritated and sits down

EVA
Nothing is OK

At first he’s vexed by her brusque response but then goes to
sit down on the sofa Meanwhile Eva turns to Georges

EVA (CONTD)
What’s going on actually You
can’t just leave her lying on her
bed like that She’s
unrecognizable Its ridiculous

GEORGES
We can’t do anything for the
moment Calm down darling She’s
getting medical treatment they
give her the necessary medication
and there are no other options
right now

EVA
What does that mean “no other
options” Why isn’t she ina
hospital

GEORGES
She had a second stroke Bertier
examined her and felt we could
spare her all the hospital
inpatient procedures

(MORE)

GEORGES (CONTD)
Anyway they wouldn’t keep her
theyd send her to a care home
What they do in those places we
can do here

Eva looks at him amazed

GEORGES (CONTD)
And she wont be put in a care
home I promised her that

GEOFF
Dont you think you’re taking on
too much

GEORGES
Have you got a better idea

Geoff doesnt know what to say Eva has composed herself
somewhat and blows her nose

EVA
I can’t believe that these days
theres no way of handling this
efficiently

GEORGES
(curtly)
No one’s stopping you from finding
out

Eva gets up furious and goes to the window Georges follows
her with his eyes

GEORGES (CONTD)
(peaceably)
Believe me I love your mother as
much as you do So please dont
treat me as if I was a total idiot
incapable of doing the obvious

EVA
I didnt say that I’m simply
questioning whether what I see
going on here is the answer to
everything

GEOFF
(to Georges)
Dont you want to get a second
opinion

GEORGES
Now you two had better stop OK
Another doctor did come He said
Bertier was right From Monday a
nurse will come three times a week
Now can we talk about something
else

EVA
Like what

GEORGES

I added a little orange juice I
find it tastes quite good

She can only swallow slowly and so something keeps running
back out of her mouth He wipes it with a tea towel
continues to feed her Finally after a few mouthfuls she
keeps her mouth shut

GEORGES (CONT’D)
Come on Anne you have to eat some
more Youve only swallowed three
mouthfuls

Anne continues to keep her lips sealed

GEORGES (CONTD)
Please darling A bit more

Anne doesnt move He puts the muesli on the night stand and
holds the sipping cup to her lips She drinks slowly one sip
after the other He pulls the cup back between each sip to
give her more time Suddenly she says

ANNE
--Mom to the concert

reassuringly Georges remains standing there helpless

SCENE 43 - INT KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY

Kitchen

Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of
coffee In front of the nurse on the table is a sum of
money As they speak we hear coming from the room Annes
CALLS FOR HELP

NURSE
-- we could take turns She’d come
from 8 till 12 and Id do 2 until
6 or 3 to 7 That would certainly
relieve the pressure on you

GEORGES
I’1l think about it

NURSE
She just has to know in time so she
can arrange it in her schedule

GEORGES
Yes of course I’ll let you know
in the next few days

NURSE
Very well I have to go now

She takes the money on the table pockets it and gets up

NURSE (CONTD)
Thanks for the coffee

GEORGES
My pleasure I’1ll see you out

They both leave the kitchen As the nurse in the hallway
takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on
she comments on Annes continuing CALLS FOR HELP

NURSE
You mustnt take it too seriously
Usually they always say something
She might just as well say “Mom
Mom Mom” It’s just mechanical

GEORGES
(nodding softly)
I know

They’ve reached the door

NURSE
Goodbye sir

GEORGES
Goodbye

He closes the door behind her Remains motionless a moment
then goes into the bedroom where Annes CALLS FOR HELP
unaltered continue

Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed takes her hand
holds her After a while Anne calms down her CALLS FOR HELP
become quieter and finally stop altogether

After a long PAUSE

GEORGES (CONTD)
(slowly softly)
Id like to hire a second nurse
The two could take turns That
would make everything a bit
simpler What do you think

Long PAUSE Then

SCENE 48 - INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

The window opening onto the light well is open A pigeon has
landed on the window ledge

It walks to and fro then finally dares to jump down inside
onto the floor It starts to explore the surroundings

We hear the TOILET FLUSH Georges comes out of the toilet
The door opening frightens the pigeon Alarmed flapping its
wings it flutters about the room

After a moment of surprise Georges tries to shoo it back
toward the window But the bird escapes in the opposite
direction George follows it

He closes the doors of the other rooms Coming from the
bedroom we faintly hear ANNE’S VOICE

Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom He chases the
bird He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes
back out through the window Georges visibly exhausted has
to sit down on the chest in the hallway

SCENE 49 - INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Georges and the second nurse

NURSE
as you wish sir I dont know
what you were expecting I gave up
another job to come and work here
You should have thought it over
before deciding whether you wanted
a second nurse or not

GEORGES
But Ive only just found out how
incompetent you are

NURSE
(furious)
Whats that supposed to mean

GEORGES
I dont want to discuss it with
you Anyway you wouldn’t
understand

NURSE
No one has ever complained

GEORGES
Good for you (To get rid of her)
How much do I owe you

NURSE
(after a brief calculation)
Seven hundred and eighty euros

Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the

The nurse pockets the money

NURSE

sorry for you

Georges has put back his wallet turns to her again and looks
at her

GEORGES
I hope from the bottom of my heart
that one day someone treats you the
way you treat your patients and
that you too will have no way of
defending yourself Now get out

She looks at him at first doesnt know what to answer then

NURSE
Go fuck yourself you old fart

She leaves slamming the door behind her A few seconds
later we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut
Georges sits down in his armchair looks straight ahead Then
he lights a cigarette his hands shake he smokes

the cup in front of her sealed lips

GEORGES (CONTD)

tries carefully but using some force to separate her teeth
Pours a little tea in The liquid runs out of her mouth

GEORGES (CONTD)
(angrily)
Goddammit

He puts down the cup takes a towel and wipes the liquid
some of which has run down onto the pillow He tries to mop
it up She watches him the whole time Finally he puts the
towel down beside the cup and looks at her Tries not to show
his helplessness and his anger

GEORGES (CONT’D)

you die of thirst If you persist
I’1l call Bertier and he’ll put you
in hospital They can force-feed
you there Is that what you want

He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips

GEORGES (CONT’D)

It hurts her so she opens her mouth and lets in a little
liquid

GEORGES (CONT’D)

She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup

GEORGES (CONT’D)

Then she spits it all out like a fountain After a moment of
bewilderment he slaps her

Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look He shakes
his head as if to play down the question and indicates back
in the direction of the living room as if to say “You
understand huh” Eva is slightly irritated but follows him
into the living room

He closes the door
GEORGES (CONTD)

GEORGES

pointless discussions on the
subject Your mother is just as
could have been expected bad the
whole time

(MORE)

down

GEORGES (CONTD)
She is turning more and more into a
helpless child and its sad and
humiliating for her and for me
And she doesnt want to be seen in
that state either Even the last
time you visited she didnt want
you to come You two have your own
life Nothing wrong with that But
let us have our life too Even
though its a lousy one OK

EVA
Dad what’s the matter

GEORGES
Nothings the matter your visit
caught me by surprise And Im
annoyed that you show up here to
check that everythings OK Who do

PAUSE Eva is speechless

EVA

Then she gets up and makes to go to the door

GEORGES
Stay here will you

She stops short looks at him
GEORGES (CONTD)
(softly but insistently)

She hesitates a moment but winds up leaving the living room

WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND
HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR

EVA (0S)

Georges remains seated motionless until she comes back She
seems upset by the situation as one would expect

EVA (CONTD)
Tell me what’s going on Have you
gone crazy

GEORGES
Please sit down

EVA
I dont want to sit down What’s
going on here

GEORGES
(quietly)
Nothing’s going on I want to spare
us all a pointless drama I presume
your mother is asleep She mostly
sleeps the whole day And then she
wakes up at night If you really
want to we’ll go and see her ina
little while Now sit down OK

They look at each other

Reluctantly Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down
PAUSE Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice

GEORGES (CONTD)
We do our speech exercises every
day or we sing together Most of
the time I wake up around 5 At
that time shes still awake Then
we change her incontinence pad I
rub cream on her to avoid sores
Then around 7 I try to persuade
her to eat and drink Sometimes it
works sometimes not Sometimes she
tells me things from her childhood
then for hours she calls for help
and then an instant later shes
giggling away to herself or
crying Nothing of any of that is
worth showing to anyone

SILENCE Eva looks down Finally she says
EVA
(softly)
You can’t stop me from seeing her
GEORGES
(also softly)
No

They remain seated for a moment finally Eva gets up Georges
follows her into the hallway

He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom

The bright light from outside filters through the blinds

Eva goes over to the bed looks at Anne Finally she
caresses her face shyly and clumsily Anne opens her eyes
Looks at her No movement

EVA
It’s me Mom

Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND
EVA (CONTD)
(helpless)

Can I do something for you Mom

ANNE
Mom Mom Mom Mom Mom

SILENCE
Georges has remained by the door After a while they both
leave the bedroom cross the hallway to come back in the

living room

Georges closes the door For an instant he puts a consoling
hand on Evas shoulder Then he sits down

Eva trying to compose herself goes toward the window and
looks outside Suddenly she starts sobbing

After a while Georges gets up and goes out of the room Eva
vexed blows her nose

Shortly after Georges comes back He has another teacup in
his hand puts it down beside his on the table and sits down

GEORGES
The tea isn’t very hot any more

Eva turns toward him

GEORGES (CONTD)
But it does make you feel better

After a short PAUSE Eva comes toward the table Sits down
He fills her cup

EVA
Thanks

She takes the cup drinks Replaces it Still can’t bring
herself to look at him
GEORGES
It was silly of me to lock the
door I’m sorry You took me by
surprise that’s all I’m sorry

She nods her head indicating she understands Finally she

looks at him

EVA
What’s going to happen now

GEORGES
(with a little ironic laugh)
What’s going to happen now The
nurse comes twice a week and every
two weeks Dr Bertier and the
hairdresser come That’s what you
want to know right
Things will go on as they have done
up until now Theyll go from bad
to worse Things will go on and
then one day it will all be over

bedroom

ANNES VOICE

Georges wipes his face and to the sound of Annes cries
crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom

Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself
Georges goes over to her bed
GEORGES
(trying to calm her like a sick

child) What is it
(MORE)

GEORGES (CONTD)
Are you in pain What’s the
matter Is your pad full

He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs then
replaces it

GEORGES (CONTD)
No So what’s hurting you

He sits down beside her on the bed Takes her hand

GEORGES (CONTD)
It’s all right its all right
I’m here everything’s fine
well Hold on I’1ll tell you a
story but you must be quiet I
can’t talk too loud it wears me
out Here we go when I was
little well I wasn’t as little
as all that it was toward the
end of primary school so I was
about ten Dad and Mom sent me to a
holiday camp They thought it would
do me good to spend the summer with
kids my own age We were lodged
in an old castle in the midst of a
magnificent wooded landscape I
think it was in the Auvergne I
don’t know in any case it was
the opposite of what Id
expected We had to get up at 6
and go for a morning swim Not far
from the castle there was a pond
fed by an icy mountain stream We
entered it running in a double
file You know I was never very
sporty They had a program to keep
us on the go all day probably to
nip any potential pubescent
impulses in the bud But the
worst thing was the food The third
day after our arrival there was
rice pudding for lunch I hate rice
pudding We sat at long tables in a
huge hall I didnt want to eat the
stuff and the housemaster said to
me You wont get up until you’ve
cleared your plate So after the
meal everybody left the room and I
remained seated in tears I had
made a secret pact with Mom I was
to send her a postcard every week

(MORE)

GEORGES (CONTD)
If I was pleased with the place I
was to draw some flowers on it or
if not some stars She kept the
card it was covered all over in
stars After three hours I was
allowed to leave the table I went
up to my room got into bed and had
a fever of 42 degrees It was
diphtheria They took me to the
nearest hospital where I was put in
an isolation ward which meant that
Mom when she came to visit me
could only wave at me through a
window At some point I lost that
postcard It’s a pity

Anne has become ever calmer during Georges story He still
holds her hand

LONG SILENCE

Then Georges reaches across Annes body to get hold of his
pillow and presses it over her face STIFLED SOUNDS from
Anne Everything that can still move in her body starts to
move Georges presses down heavily on the pillow lies on it
with his whole weight for a long time until all Annes
movements stop Then he sits up exhausted and without
removing the pillow from her face remains seated beside her

SILENCE
SCENE 55 - INT HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY

The front door of the apartment is unlocked Georges in city
clothes enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
flowers He puts down the bags takes off his coat hangs it
in the closet

The TELEPHONE RINGS Georges takes the bags and carries them
in the kitchen puts them in the sink fills it with water
He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water
We watch him doing so for a while Meanwhile the TELEPHONE
HAS STOPPED RINGING

SCENE 56 - INT HALLWAY - DAY

Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
closet He is looking for a specific dress He takes some
out puts them back inside One of the dresses slips off its
hanger and falls to the floor He picks it up hangs it up
again He ends up finding the one he was looking for He
takes it out on its hanger Closes the closet again

Looks at the dress Then he lowers his arm a little and is
about to leave the bedroom He catches his feet in the dress

He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
wheelchair that is parked there Exhausted he flops down
into it

SCENE 57 - INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

With wide adhesive tape Georges seals up the door frame of
the bedroom

SCENE 58 - INT KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY

Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
with Anne in Scene 8 and writes a letter PAUSES for
reflection GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS scarcely audible
Suddenly Georges starts

At the far end of the long kitchen beside the door between
the kitchen units a pigeon is walking Georges stares at it
For a long time

Then he gets up slowly and via the door located beside the
kitchen table he goes into the adjoining room

On the sofa there he has set up his new bed He takes the
wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen
carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm
Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
over the pigeon But it manages to escape into the hallway

Georges follows it This action is repeated several times
The pigeon is more and more panicky starts to fly up
flutters about in all directions Georges closes the light-
well window to cut off its escape route This lasts an
exhausting amount of time but he ends up capturing it He
cuddles it against him rolled up in the blanket leans
against a wall then holds it as if it were a baby

SCENE 59 - INT ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT

From the adjoining room we see Georges seated at the kitchen
table writing Finally we see what he is writing

you wont believe it A pigeon came in for the second
time already through the light well This time I caught it
In fact it wasn’t difficult at all But I set it free again
I’m going to

SCENE 60 - INT ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY

Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room staring at
the ceiling 0S we faintly hear the SOUND of running
water and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES

After a while Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen

He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who doing the
dishes at first doesn’t pay attention to him then notices
his presence and shoots him a quick glance saying casually

ANNE
I’m almost done

Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly

ANNES VOICE
You can put your shoes on if you
want

Georges looks at her an instant longer passes beside her
goes into the hallway sits down on a stool beside the closet
and puts on his shoes 0S we hear Anne finishing her work
She comes out hangs up her apron in the closet disappears
for a few moments into the bathroom Meanwhile Georges has
got up and looks in the bathroom where clearly Anne is
tidying her hair and sprucing herself up When she comes out
again he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
on

ANNE
Thanks

They head for the front door

ANNE (CONTD)
Arent you taking a coat

Georges thinks a few seconds then takes his trench-coat from
the hook and they leave the apartment

SCENE 61 - INT HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM
— DAY

Four long shots all the windows are open The sun is
shining It is fairly bright

Hallway

SILENCE Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED Eva comes
into the apartment Remains a long time beside the door
Looks around her ill at ease Finally she hesitantly goes
into the bedroom

Annes twin bed isn’t there any more On Georges’ bed lies
only the bare mattress Eva remains there a moment then goes
through the partition door into the dining room

There everything is as usual Eva continues into the living
room

There too everything is as usual Eva stops by the piano
stool Looks out of the window feeling at a loss Then she
heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner On the
table lie the remains of a snack Eva looks at the table
turns again toward the open windows through which we hear
STREET NOISE Then she sits down exhausted in one of the
armchairs Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room
