The following is very loosely based on some shit that

happened
OVER BLACK

We hear the roar of a V8 engine piped out through some
throaty fucked up muffler as

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
An 89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the

Its got a rusted two-tone paint job Maryland plates and
bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the

EXT SUBURBS - DAY

The car fast approaches a stop sign dangerously blows

the intersection

We dont see the DRIVER only the redlining RPMs Vans slip-

cranks right as the car turns onto a -

One way street A minivan flies right at us The Mustang
hops up onto the curb to avoid it clips a trash can and -

Garbage explodes like confetti The wipers engage brushing

Brake pads smoke The Mustang stops outside
EXT HOUSE - DAY

The Driver jumps out of the car As he rushes to the front
door we see the urgent package he is delivering

TWO LARGE PIZZAS

Before he can ring the bell the door opens and two smug 15-
YEAR-OLDS stare out

15-YEAR-OLD
Thats 34 minutes Youre 4 minutes
late Pizzas free

REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids This is WILL probably good looking in another life

Right now he is tired and unamused wearing a red
Giorgios
Trattoria hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt

WILL
Gimme a break You guys live two
towns away Its pretty much fucking
impossible to get here in 30 minutes

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
Exactly Thats why we ordered from
your shitty trattoria

WILL
This is gonna come out of my paycheck
You sure you dont want to take the
moral high ground

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
Wed rather take the pizzas

Will takes a calming breath Hands over the pizzas

WILL
Ok You guys are pretty smart You
figured out a way to beat the system
(PEEKS INSIDE)
Got the house to yourselves
15-YEAR-OLD
Thats right

WILL
Not bad Any jailbait in there
Little pizza and a rainbow party

The kids shakes their heads

WILL
Seriously Well two hustlers like
yourselves gotta have the place
stocked with beer and whippits and
shit right Just call the girls up
and let them know the partys on

15-YEAR-OLD
Man we dont have any of that stuff

Will makes a show of mulling this over

WILL
I really shouldnt do thisbut you
seem like a couple of good dudes
Ill tell you what you give me the
money that your mom left you for the
pizzas and Ill grab you some beers

(MORE)

WILL (CONTD)
(BEAT)
But I get to keep the change as a
tip Deal

The kids look at each other One hesitantly pulls out some
cash Will snatches it and heads off

WILL
Ill see you in like 20 minutes

The kids look uncertain As if sensing this Will stops
before getting into his ride

WILL
You boys like Budweiser right

15-YEAR-OLD
Uh yeah totally

OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
Love that shit
INT MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING

The sun sets Will cruises back into his own middle-class

town in suburban Maryland

A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat

Will stops at a light Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in

the Jeep beside him She catches him looking

eyes The light turns and the Jeep skids away

Will self consciously removes his Giorgios cap

INT GIORGIOS TRATTORIA - NIGHT

Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s)

the manager

rolls her

His

balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a days

worth of pizza grease

WILL
Yo Chris Let me cash the fuck out

Will hands over some cash to Christopher

CHRISTOPHER
You have a pretty good shift

WILL
For sure I mean the part where I
had to drop off all those pizzas
kinda sucked but the rest was cool

CHRISTOPHER
Oh yeah Cause I got some kids
calling in saying you ripped them off
Promised to buy them beer or something

WILL
I actually did buy the beer but it
would have been illegal to give it
to them right So Im gonna do the
responsible thing and drink it myself

CHRISTOPHER
Thats real funny But Im trying
to run a business here

WILL
What kind of business promises to
deliver anywhere in 30 minutes
Its ridiculous

CHRISTOPHER
I dont wanna hear another one of
your bullshit excuses Youre fired

WILL
Come on If I didnt need this job
I wouldnt be doing this shitty job

Chris is unmoving

WILL
Fuck Whatever

Will storms off As he gets to the door -

CHRISTOPHER
You know you were an okay driver
half the time And youre not a Puerto
Rican Which means something to me

WILL
Thats poignant

CHRISTOPHER
I guess I could rehire you ona
provisional basis Of course this
would be at the slightly reduced
new company rate

WILL
Are you fucking serious

CHRISTOPHER
I dont know Is there anyone else

left in town for you to work for

Will shakes his head Swallows whats left of his pride
WILL

When do I start
EXT SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Will sits on the darkened front stoop He tosses an empty
can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer

He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra A YOUNG MAN sits
in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face He
makes a sudden surprised gasp The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
herself in the driver seat She leans over for a goodbye
kiss The Young Man obliges with much fanfare

The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away This is CHET a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection
He heads toward the building high off his BJ humming
Outkasts Ms Jackson He stops when he notices Will in
the shadows
CHET
What the hell Have you just been
sitting there
WILL
Yep Caught the whole show Really
classy move at the end You know
the kiss Putting your tongue in
her mouth right after you fucked it
CHET
Hey a nice girl decides to pleasure
me on a weeknight in her car no
lessIm not gonna make her feel
like an untouchable Im gonna make
her feel like a lady
WILL
What manners May I offer you some
alcohol sir To wash the taste of
yourself out of your mouth
Will offers his beer Chet takes a slug gurgles for effect

CHET
By the way she said she had a friend
Maybe we can go on our first double
date since you tried to talk Jackie
Fortunato and her cousin into having
a four-way with us

WILL
I misread their body language It
happens

Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him

WILL
Come on Lets go inside drink
your beer and watch shit get crazy
(FANS MOVIES)
Old favorites You choose Lethal
Weapon Lethal Weapon 2was gonna
get the third Lethal Weapon but
decided on a porn So its really
between the first two

CHET
I choose sleep I gotta teach a
class at eight
WILL
Youre a sub Just call in sick
Like the real teacher did

CHET
Come on man you know I got promoted
to full-time last month You bought

Will heaves a sigh

WILL
Yeah I know I guess Im just having
a hard time accepting you as the
man You know flunking kids giving
out spite detentions to girls you
wanna fuck laser pointing at shit

CHET
I also get healthcare and my summers
off Its not perfect but its a
career

Will grudgingly stands up

WILL

I guess thats just the difference
between you and me

He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs

WILL
Im like Riggs Cruising the streets
No rules no attachments Every
other day some asshole is trying to
take my badge Youre fucking
Murtaugh Always worried about your
pension Well guess what it gets
old after the first movie

CHET
I just got head Im totally Riggs

Will shakes his head turns and walks off

INT STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

Will wakes up legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch

His TV is still on displaying the menu screen from a porn

Will looks down at his coffee table Clears some magazines

to reveal a file folder Flips the cover -

Its full of college applications drafts of admissions
essays

a junior college transcript Will thumbs through one of the
another

glossy applications The kids look young Very young

Will glances over at a picture on his wall he and Chet at

high school graduation looking just as young They have

their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them Will

and the girl look very high and very happy

Will shuts the folder slides it back under the coffee table

debris He looks over at a clock it is already 200 PM
WILL

Fuck

INT MUSTANG - DAY

Will jumps in and starts the engine As he tucks his

Giorgios cap onto his head he catches his reflection in

the rear-view mirror

WILL
You asshole You titanic asshole
Come on down and get your prize

He makes his fingers into a gun puts it to his headpulls
the trigger and

BOOM
WERE IN
EXT OPEN FIELD - DAY

A watermelon explodes in a shower of red juicy bits Loud
dumb laughter echoes

Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE an intense meaty guy
in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt On his left bicep
is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird

DWAYNE
Fruit motherfuckin salad

Crouched beside him is JAY tall and awkward in a wool
surplus cap He carefully rigs homemade explosives to

watermelon then looks up at Dwayne His eyes are magnified
into saucers by his thick glasses Theres a peculiar
eagerness to please in them

JAY
This ones gonna blow even bigger

DWAYNE
Boy if you werent such a skinny
little bitch you coulda been in the
military or something
JAY
Whatever I dont need the military
I taught myself how to do this shit

DWAYNE
I hear that I taught myself how to
eat pussy And cut my own hair

Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away He returns
and pulls out a detonator Dwayne snatches it

DWAYNE

This ones all me

(makes radio sounds)

Mr President we have enemies at
the gate Give me the order
(more radio sounds)

Fuck that sir I dont negotiate
with terrorists

Dwayne presses a button and

BOOM

The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys

smiling faces with fruit juice

INT KITCHEN NICE HOUSE - DAY

Large and early-90s chic Dwayne and Jay have the fridge

open fixing themselves a cold cut plate

Dwayne is debating

the amount of meat on the plateadds some more

DWAYNE

Wanna make sure I get enough calories

JAY
I thought you wanted to get diesel
for the summer Bang that towel

DWAYNE

Grab some RC Cola

INT LIVING ROOM NICE HOUSE - DAY
The shades are drawn We hear a girl scream bloody murder

The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3in 3D They

Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax

JAY
Shit man Its so real

Dwayne reaches out touching the 3D images He stands and
starts humping the air

DWAYNE
Check it out I aint afraid of
Jason Im fucking him

(THRUSTING HARDER)
You like that Jason In the mask

Jay cracks up The lights flick on

GRIZZLED VOICE (0S)
Who are you two fags fucking

Standing by the switch is Dwaynes dad JERRY (70s) Most
people just call him THE MAJOR The faded USMC tattoo on
his thick forearm explains why

JAY
Afternoon Major

Dwayne flops back onto the couch

DWAYNE
Dad were watching a flick We got
45 minutes and a potential 3D sex
scene left Youre sorta coming in
at the worst possible moment

MAJOR
I bought that TV set so I could watch
my programs not so you and your
friend could louse up my couch

DWAYNE
You gotta learn how to share the
Jay

common space

MAJOR
The only thing common in this house
is you You remind me of your damn
mother Fat dumb and in my way

The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch He
gets right in his facescary intense Dwayne turns to

DWAYNE
Lets get outta here This movie
sucks anyway

Jay gets up and files out the door Dwayne goes to take the
cold cut plate The Major grabs his arm

MAJOR
I paid for the damn cold cuts too
Maybe if you had a job or a fucking
prospect or a clue how to find any
of the above Id let you eat em

DWAYNE

(QUIETLY)
You know you can be a real
sonofabitch dad

MAJOR
Thats what it takes boy In the
Corps men like you wore dresses to
keep us entertained

DWAYNE

Dwayne storms off

The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out

INT DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY

R Kellys Ignition (Remix) pumps

Large fake breasts sparkling with cheap body glitter and
pierced at the nipples shake before us Their owner JUICY a petite Latina phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours
his heart out to her

Somewhere in the background Jay hangs at the bar all
alone

DWAYNE
- and he thinks he knows me He
dont know shit I got ideas he
could never dream of I got plans
bigger than his fucking house
(BEAT)
He didnt even raise me My mother
did That was a good woman

JUICY

Dwayne shifts uncomfortably at the sore subject

DWAYNE
She passed on

JUICY
I hope youre not one of those guys
that comes here looking to get
mothered

DWAYNE
I wouldnt mind nursing on them
titties mamacita

JUICY
Sure Whatever you say Maybe just
keep quiet for a while forget about
your old man and let me do my thing

DWAYNE
I wish I could forget about that
asshole for good Im just waiting
around for him to drop dead Dont
wanna mess with my inheritance

This piques Juicys interest
JUICY

What kinda inheritance

DWAYNE

When my dad got outta the service he

started buying lotto tickets Hed

play his dog tag numbers In 91

INSERT PHOTO The Major holding a giant cardboard check
DWAYNE

He had some health problems a few

years back and since then hes been

burning through the money like an

NBA draft pick Probably only got a

million or two left But its mine

as soon as he kicks
Behind inch-long fake eyelashes Juicys shrewd eyes narrow
mind working She straddles Dwayne tightly

JUICY

You know with a million bucks you
could have anything Be like a king
(almost a moan)
King Dwayne

DWAYNE
Thats right And maybe Ill make
you my queen Let you polish my
royal scepter

JUICY
Practice makes perfect
Juicy pantomimes a long slow chicken head Dwayne is
blissed
out She smiles at him sticky sweet
JUICY
Let me ask you a questiondo you
really hate your daddy
DWAYNE
Hate him like the Steelers
JUICY
Then maybe I can help you get that
money now Before he spends another
penny

Dwayne looks confused Juicy puts his hands on her breasts
emboldening him

JUICY
I know a guy in Baltimore He could
help you out Probably do it for

100Gs

DWAYNE
Do what

pointer

Juicy leans in whispers softly in Dwaynes ear -

JUICY
Kill your mean old dad

On Dwaynes face as this new possibility pinballs around his
mind setting off a flood of different emotions

JUICY
So what do you thinkyou ready
for your crown

INT MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING

Will has one pizza left in the back of his car He pulls
over outside an office building

INT LAW FIRM OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
Rows of cubicles Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS

eyes too busy generating detailed lists of places theyd
rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along Will stops
before one such work station looks on for a beat

WILL
Rio

KATE turns from the glow of her computer screen She
has short messy hair and a sarcastic smile This is the
girl from the picture in Wills apartment

KATE

WILL

KATE
Interesting theory

Kate opens the pizza box grabs a slice

KATE

Small He came out to me today on
Facebook

WILL
That kid beat the hell out of me and
Chet in grammar school Wow

KATE

KATE

KATE

WILL
Sure I get it Here we are Friday
night Nowhere to be

Kate shoves Will good-naturedly

KATE
You know what I mean

Will shrugs quietly devastated Goes back to his pizza
INT SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring
from a large flat-screen TV

At a booth in back Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation

JAY
I dont wanna stick my nose into a
family matterbut killing your old
man Thats pretty messed upI
mean unless you think it isnt

DWAYNE
What we have here is a classic lesser
of two evils debate You got one
evil me shaving a few years off The
Majors shitty life Then you got
the other evil The Major ruining my
entire awesome life by blowing through
my inheritance Maybe Im biased
but mine sure as shit seems like the
lesser

JAY
I guess Isorta see where youre
coming from And you have been
waiting around forever for that money
You deserve it Dwayne

Dwayne nods seriously

DWAYNE
You know theres a reason I sleep
til noon everyday And it aint
cause Im lazy Its on account of
me having so many goddamn dreams
Big ones And once that moneys
mine theyre all gonna come true

Dwayne takes a long sip of beer contemplative

DWAYNE

Like I had this one dream last night
I was cruising through town ina
Lamborghini Diablo The wind was
blowing through my hair ruffling my
open shirt There was a hot little
piece of ass sitting next to me And
in the back seat Jaywas you
Strapped Wearing a pair of Oakleys
JAY
Wow I didnt know you dreamt about
me Dwayne

DWAYNE
It was only this once Jay To be
honest I didnt know what to make
of it So I consulted my dream book
and found out it means this youre
my road dog You got my back

(MORE)

DWAYNE (CONTD)
Thats why I want to make you my
partner

JAY
n what

DWAYNE
n crime And business You see it
aint just about the inheritance money
ts about what Im gonna do with it

Dwayne leans across the table

DWAYNE
Im about to clue you in on something
And then youll understand the true
magnitude of whats at stake here
Are you ready

JAY
Yes Im totally ready

DWAYNE
Then answer me thiswhats this
town missing Ill give you a hint
Its a cash business crawling with
sexy bitches

JAY
(BEAT)
A Chinese food restaurant

DWAYNE
No A tanning salon

(BEAT)
Think about it All that green
All that brown flesh
Jay nods thinking about He smiles

DWAYNE
Its also the perfect front for a
prostitution ring

JAY
Yeah of course Because of the booths

DWAYNE
Yes And because of the bitches
(BEAT)
It can all be ours 30 percent for
you 70 percent for me You just
gotta help me out here

Jay looks conflicted Dwayne goes dark like a spurned
lover

DWAYNE
Im starting to wonder if my dream
book was wrong about you Maybe you
sitting behind me doesnt mean youre
my road dog Maybe it means youre
plotting to stab me in the back
like some snake in the grass

JAY
Thats crazy Id never do something
like that The dream book was right

Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes knows its all or nothing

JAY
Ok Ill do it But Im not shooting
him or anything Ill hold him while
you shoot him Thats it

Dwayne chuckles

DWAYNE
Heres a fact they dont build prisons
for criminals they build them for
idiots Shit they got three different
types of CSI on TV just laying out
how the police do their businessand
still idiots like you think you can
just go out and do a murder yourself
(BEAT)
If you wanna be a millionaire you
gotta think like one And
millionaires dont kill people
They hire assassins Which I did
We gotta pay him on Tuesday

JAY
What Why would you do that

DWAYNE
I was presented with an opportunity
I took it 100 thousand bucks for a
highly trained assassin is a steal

JAY
But we dont have that kinda money

DWAYNE
Now were addressing the real problem
how do we get the 100 grand Cause
once we get that we get the million
(MORE)

DWAYNE (CONTD)
And once we get the million we will
literally own this town and every
single thing in it

JAY
I guess we could justrob a bank
One of these local banks with nothing
but a dipshit security guard

DWAYNE
Again not quite thinking like a
millionaire

JAY
Okay then lets hire someone to rob
a bank

Dwayne thinks about this for a second

DWAYNE
Fuck hiring them we could just force
someone to rob a bank for us Like
with blackmail or death threats or -

JAY
(ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)
A bomb Everyones scared of a bomb
DWAYNE
I was gonna say hypnotismbut I
like that Its out of the fucking
box We just strap one to some
motherfuckers chest like we did to
those watermelons Think you can
you build some kinda bomb vest

JAY
Yeah I meancamel jockeys do it
in caves I got a garage workshop

DWAYNE
Im pretty sure this is exactly how
a millionaire would do it And the
beauty of it is we dont lose any
sleep cause no one gets hurt

JAY
Except The Major

DWAYNE
Yeah The Major dies But no one
gets hurt

Dwayne smiles But a nagging thought interrupts him -

DWAYNE
Theres just one problem Where do
we get our guy Cause if we do a
kidnapping then were right back
where we starteddoing shit thats
gonna get us caught

(MIND WORKING)
What we need is someone to come to
usto a place where we can control
the situation Someone without any
connection to us

The guys stare at each other stumped Until something
catches Dwaynes attentiona local commercial playing on
the flat-screen A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box -

PIZZA CHEF

(ON TV)
Well deliver anywhere in 30 minutes
or less Or your pizza is free
Giorgios Trattoria where the
customer gets what they wantpronto

The guys look at each other

DWAYNE
Sometimes fate just takes out its cock
and slaps you in the face with it

INT CHETS APARTMENT - DAY

A hand grabs a beer from the fridge

VOICE (0S)

CHET

A day or so has passed Will sits on his couch an unshaven
mess watching Lethal Weapon 2 Murtaugh and Riggs laugh
and joke around Best buds

Will looks like he might cry He goes for his beer knocks
it over He stares at the growing puddle of beerthen
grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them
to sop it up

INT GIORGIOS TRATTORIA - NIGHT
Will sits at a table looking out through the misty window
Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him

CHRISTOPHER
Come on wake up and get to work

Christopher hands him the order slip Will checks the

WILL
Where the fuck is this

CHRISTOPHER
How should I know Its 30 minutes
away or the pizza comes out of your
paycheck Tick tock

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Wills Mustang travels down a dark empty stretch of

The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into
the distance

EXT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway Overgrown
shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view All that

Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the
sky beacon light flashing atop it

Will checks the address then drives through the open gate
radio

EXT RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway Will gets out
There is a large storage shed and across a clearing a

tower built on top of a small office structure

The office door is ajar Florescent light glows from inside

WILL
Hello

DWAYNE (0S)

(calling back from beyond door)

Hey bud Sorry for the hike The
countys got us doing repairs at the
ass end of the night

This puts Will at ease He heads toward the office As he
gets close a figure appears in the doorway It is Dwayne

WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK

WILL
What the -

Will hears something behind him and whirls around -

To find Jay also in a gorilla mask charging at him

WILL
Holy fuck

Will makes a run for it But the guys are on top of him in
no time He madly fights them off and dashes for his car

DWAYNE
Stop We got a gun you asshole

Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery

DWAYNE
Fuck Get him

Jay is right on Wills tail Without breaking stride Jay
picks up a large branch and wings it at him

Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself Jay leaps
on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Wills body
WILL
What the hell
(at a loss)
Rape

Jay wrestles something from his pocket A chloroform soaked
rag He presses it hard against Wills mouth and nose
Will soon goes limp

Dwayne appears looming above them He pulls his gorilla
mask back and smiles

DWAYNE
Step one

CUT TO
Blurry vision coming into focus Two gorillas
EXT RADIO TOWER - DAY

Whereas the masks looked scary at night they look
ridiculous

now Will is propped up on the hood of his car staring at

his captors His mouth is duct taped hands bound behind his

back He wears his Giorgios cap and a buttoned up olive

green Army jacket

DWAYNE

You thought we were gonna rape you
(CHUCKLES )

Idiot

Will mumbles something through the duct tape

DWAYNE
Just shut up The tape is there for
a reason Cause this next part is
gonna take a measure of calm Are
you with me Can you be calm

Will nods Dwayne holds up his driver license

DWAYNE
Will Dixon of 112 North Whatever-
The-Fuck Street right now you are
wearing an explosive vest

Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing tries to get
his hands loose so he can tear it open
DWAYNE
Calm the fuck down

Will stiffens For emphasis Dwayne reveals the gun tucked
down the front of his pants like a big metal cock

DWAYNE
Now stay still and my associate will
show you

Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket Will is in fact

wearing an explosive vest It is a cobbled together but

intimidating looking contraption crisscrossed by
multicolored

wires There is a thick lock at the hinge with a digital

display and a keypad

Will begins to hyperventilate

JAY
Take it easy man Youre fine I
built this thing Its pretty stable

DWAYNE
For a fucking bomb So dont trip
over your shoelaces or anything
That things full of C-4 And the C
is for chaos

JAY
Actually the C stands for composite
But yeah Id try not to slam into
stuff

DWAYNE
Can I take that tape off now pizza boy

Will nods Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth

WILL
Help

Dwayne chuckles

DWAYNE
You know where you are You might
as well be in space motherfucker
Nobody can hear you scream

WILL
Why are you doing this to me I
dont have any money

DWAYNE
Not yet But youre gonna go get us
some

WILL
Okay Sure man Whatever you say

DWAYNE

WILL
Where the fuck am I supposed to get
that much money

DWAYNE
The Donner-Wells National Bank on
Charles Road

JAY
Across the street from the Olive
Garden

DWAYNE

Yeah the one across the street from
the Olive Garden

WILL
Do you guys have an account or
something

Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot

DWAYNE
No I dont have an account Youre
gonna rob it

WILL
How the fuck am I supposed to rob a
bank

DWAYNE
Figure it out You got a bomb strapped
to your chest Thats a start Itll
scare the fuck outta people Maybe
use your brain and go get a gun
Borrow one from a friend for all I
care It aint rocket science
WILL
Then do it yourself

DWAYNE
I would but Im already wearing
this gorilla mask and youre already
wearing that bomb

(TO JAY)
Tell him about the vest

Jay turns to Will

JAY
You seem like a pretty trustworthy
guy I mean you got a job and all
But just in case you were gonna try
to take the vest off we booby trapped
it to shit Theres also a remote
detonator on the back so we can
trigger it by dialing a number

DWAYNE
And its on speed dial So do what
you gotta do but well be watching
(MORE)

DWAYNE (CONTD)
You go anywhere near a police station
and Fourth of July comes early this
year

Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest

DWAYNE
Its 900 AM You got 8 hours

He hands Will a slip of paper

DWAYNE
Once you have the money call this
number and youll be given instructions
on where to drop it You do good we
give you the six-digit combination
that stops the timer and opens the
lock Tomorrow morning you can go
back to delivering pizza the mail
whatever the fuck you want

(BEAT)
Now let me demonstrate what happens
if you dont get us the money
side

Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear rigged
with its own bomb vest sits on a tree stump 20 yards away
Dwayne mimes answering a phone -

DWAYNE
Hey Teddy Ruxpinwhats that
You dont have the money It was
too tough to rob the bank so you
just went back to your bear cave and
cried like a bitch Well guess
what my stuffed friendtime is up

Jay pushes a button on a detonator Teddy Ruxpin explodes
All that remains is a cloud of stuffing

Will is frozen in fear

DWAYNE
I liked that bear I dont even
know you

Dwayne throws Will his car keys

DWAYNE
Go on Get outta here

WILL
Guys can we please just talk about
this

DWAYNE

Yeah of course we can

Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Wills feet
Jay jumps backward as does Will who hits the hood of his
car Slides across it and onto the ground by the driver

DWAYNE
Be careful

Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
car adjusting to the weight of the bomb As he starts the
engine and backs away -

DWAYNE
Thats right Get the fuck out of
here Youre wasting time

Once the car is gone Jay yanks off his gorilla mask Dwayne
stays primate

JAY
What the hell Dwayne You told me
that was a replica gun

DWAYNE
It was Then I paid a Mexican 50
bucks to put a firing pin in it
Now it goes boom

JAY
We didnt discuss a loaded gun
Especially not with the bomb around

Dwayne gets right in Jays face The plastic eyes of his
mask betray no emotion

DWAYNE
Dont you ever question me Im
fucking this bitch Youre just
holding the camera

JAY
(VOICE FALTERS)
Sure Dwaynewhatever you say

DWAYNE
Good Cause this aint the Marines
This is cash money You hesitate you
fuck upand I will leave you behind

A tense beat Dwayne pulls his mask off He looks oddly
calm

DWAYNE

Lets go get some breakfast

INT CLASSROOM JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map

Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH

with his laser pointer -

CHET

thousand square miles was part of
the initial Louisiana Purchase

SEVENTH GRADER

The class giggles Chet embarrassed puts away the pointer

There is a knock at the door Chet turns to see Wills face
in the doors window pane He looks back to his class

an asshole you were Well its
gonna take a lot more than some
pathetic groveling -

WILL

(SUDDENLY)
Chet Shut up I dont wanna
apologize to you

CHET
Then what do you want Because we
dont have anything left to say to
each other

Will swallows hard

WILL
Here goes And this is gonna sound
crazy Because it is fucking crazy
But last night two guys in masks
jumped me and strapped a bomb to my
chest and now I have less than eight
hours to rob a bank

Chet just stares at Will unimpressed
CHET
Youre hysterical Got me Great

joke Im going back to work now

Will steps in Chets way He unbuttons his jacket
the bomb

CHET
What the fuck Is that real

Will nods

revealing
Chet jumps backward stumbles over a desk and scurries on

his ass to the other end of the classroom He presses
himself

flat against the wall

CHET
Stay away from me What the fuck
are you involved in Terrorism

WILL
Chet do you really think Ima
terrorist

CHET

Yes One of the dumb ones The
ones they convince to wear the bombs

WILL
I am not fucking around here Two
guys did this to me And if I dont
rob that bank in time this thing is
gonna blow

CHET
Seriously

WILL
Seriously

CHET

And your first idea was to come to a
school filled with young children

WILL
I didnt -

CHET
Just back the fuck away from me with
that thing

Will backs all the way up so that the guys are on opposite
ends of the classroom

WILL
Listen I think the vest is safe for
now These guys dont want me to
blow myself up on accident before I
get their money

CHET
Oh so you figure the two psychopaths
that rigged a bomb to your chest
made sure it was safe Theres no
margin for error in their fucking
bomb vest design

WILL
I dont know All I do know is that
this is real This is happening
And Im sure you hate me as much as
I hate you right now but I have
nowhere else to go

CHET
For what

WILL
For help Chet I need your help
Please I cant do this alone

Chet looks Will over His desperation is palpable Chet
bites his lip weighing the situation

CHET

Damn it

(takes a breath)

d like to tell you to get fucked
but you know what the problem isI
a better man than you And someday
might actually forgive you So if
let you blow up or whatever that
shit might come back and eat at my
conscience and totally affect my
relationships with other people
Like my wife and kids and shit

m

WILL
Thats avery rational way to look
at the situation

(GENUINELY)
And youre right about being a better
guy than me

fq

Chet takes a step toward Will
CHET
Are you sure that thing isnt gonna

blow at any second

Will just looks at Chetunable to offer any assurance
After a beat -

CHET
Could you just walk a few feet in
front of me for a while

WILL
I can do that

Will opens the door stops looks back at Chet

WILL
Thank you

Will heads out Chet takes a breath bracing himself
INT HALLWAY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Will walks down the empty hallway He glances back over his
shoulder where Chet walks several feet behind him

CHET
Yes Im still here I really am
this stupid Just pay attention to
where youre going

WILL
I think I can handle it

CHET
These floors get waxed once a week
On Tuesday which today is You hit
a slick patch trip and fall and I
got a classroom full of kids wearing
their skin inside out

WILL

Chet Im fucking nervous enough as
it is Please I dont need you
back seat driving me right now

CHET

Obviously
Will stops turns back toward Chet

WILL
Just for the record this isnt a
nuclear weapon strapped to my chest
And there are metal lockers on either
side of the hallway If I fall and
if this thing goes off Im probably
not taking out the whole school
CHET
Do you really want to debate this

Will sighs turns back around A second later the school
bell rings and kids flood the hallway changing classes

Will freezes Multiple kids shove past him Chet sweats
bullets gives Will a look of death

After a beat the hallway empties again

CHET
Youre an asshole

WILL
Whatever Its over

Will continues walking He tries to lighten the mood -

WILL
Who was the chick in the white jeans

CHET
Kristi Evans Why

WILL
You know why

CHET
Oh come on Just keep walking

The guys voices fade as they continue down the hallway

WILL
Come on yourself You knew exactly
who I was talking about

CHET
Fuck you Shes in the eighth grade

WILL
I bet you love it when she calls you
Mr Chet

CHET

She doesnt call me Mr Chet
Shes not a foreigner

EXT JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
The guys get to Wills car Chet wraps up a call on his cell

CHET
thanks so much Mrs Davis Ill
call you after I talk to the doctor

Chet hangs up He is standing by the passenger door He
looks over the roof of the car at Will

CHET
So this is it

WILL
This is what

CHET
Once I step inside this car Im
basically in a steel coffin with you
andthat thing And if it goes
off all theyre gonna find in there
are two charred bodies and pieces of
a bomb Theyll assume we were driving
to a government building to blow it
up Itll be all over the news
Next thing you now some militia or
Islam group is claiming us as members
My family will be humiliated

WILL
Well also be dead in that particular
situation so it wont really matter

CHET
Exactly

Will sighs

WILL
I get it Take your time man

Will gets in the car and shuts the door He looks out at
Chet who stands uncertainly by the passenger side

CHET
This is the worlds biggest favor
you motherfucker You didnt even
help me move last winter

Chet reluctantly hops in
INT MUSTANG - DAY
Will fires up the engine

CHET
Given the situation I think you
should obey all traffic safety laws

WILL
Fine

Will pulls out of the school parking lot

WILL
Okay so where are we going

CHET
I have no idea I just got in your

car I thought you had a plan

WILL
Well I dont Ive been sorta
preoccupied with this crushing fear
of death

CHET
No plan I cant say Im surprised

WILL
Your plan is probably better Just
condescend me until I explode

Will goes to turn on the radio Chet grabs his hand

CHET
Maybe we should turn on the radio
See if the signal sets the bomb off
That would be an interesting experiment

Will heaves a frustrated sigh Chet eases up

CHET
Listen lets just go back to my
place Figure out our options
Maybe you can get the vest off or
something I just dont want to do
anything stupid

WILL
Unless we have to
The car hits a rough pothole Chets heart skips a beat -

CHET
Holy fucking shit

- and he throws himself against the passenger side window
as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow

Will slams the brakes

WILL
Stop it Youre scaring the fuck
out of me

CHET
Okay Okay Fuck

Chet makes the sign of the cross

CHET

Will continues driving Chet discreetly unlocks the
passenger

side door

SUPER COUNTDOWN 6 hours 59 minutes
CUT TO
INT BATHROOM CHETS APARTMENT - DAY

The door is shut Will sits on the toilet lid He has the

jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest

The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes The

wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and
complicated

purposely so to scare anyone out of fucking with it

Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he
can slide the vest offno luck

WILL
Its too tight

He is calling off toward the
KITCHEN
Where Chet is crouched in a corner at the furthest point in

the furthest room from the bathroom He uses his laptop to
look for websites on disarming a bomb

CHET
What if we try to separate your
shoulder

WILL (0S)
Fuck you
CHET

Well all these sites say different
shit Theres not a lot of consensus
in the bomb disarming community

Will emerges from the bathroom sliding the jacket back on

WILL
This is pointless

Chet shuts his laptop

CHET
I agree We gotta call the cops
have them fly in the bomb squad or
something

WILL
We cant These guys said theyd be
following me And I dont have a
clue what they look like For all I
know theyre outside right now
They see the cops show up they blow
the vest and cut their losses

Will stares at Chet hopelessly overwhelmed

WILL
What do I do man What do I do now

CHET
I dont know WillI guess you
gotta rob the bank

WILL
I havent been inside a bank in three
years How the fuck am I supposed
to rob one They wouldnt even
give me a savings account

Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands
fighting hysterics Chet offers a stock reassurance -

CHET
Its gonna be okay

WILL
No its not Im gonna blow up
Thats way worse than getting stabbed
or shot At least some people survive
that No one survives being blown
up

(MORE)

WILL (CONTD)
No one is ever like Yeah I heard
Steve got blown up tough break but
hows he doing now Is he still in
the Rec basketball league No of
course he isnt cause theres nothing
left of Steve except a stain on the
wall and a pair of fucking high tops

Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob Its a crushing
sight Chet strides across the apartment -

CHET
Pull yourself together
- and attempts to give him one of those get a grip slaps
But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear

WILL
Ow Fuck I think you popped my
eardrum

that But just listen to me now

layout of the bank

CHET

the security schematics with the
application But I sat in the waiting
area for like 20 minutes I know
what the place looks like

WILL
How many guards

CHET
One I think

WILL
Thats a start

CHET

Its a great start You can do it
Will pauses

WILL
Youre gonna do it with me right

CHET

tips ideasmotivational speeches
More of a consultant or advisory role

WILL
Jesus Christ Chet Please Im

Yes Ill fucking cry again if thats

Dwayne ejects the tape tosses it at Jay in the passenger

DWAYNE

Sorry Dwayne That song just means
a lot to me
Dwayne shakes his head He turns and looks out the

windshield

theyre parked in the Walmart lot watching the store

DWAYNE
I wish he would hurry his shit up

JAY

You worried about that other guy

Dwayne surveys the area Something catches his attention

the bland strip mall across the street Theres a

Blockbuster

Subway and an empty space in between Dwayne smiles

JAY
What You want me to run over to
Subway get us a couple sandwiches

DWAYNE
If you had any vision Jay youd
know exactly what Im thinking about
right now And its not a sandwich
(BEAT)
Look how well trafficked that shopping
mall is Its the perfect place for
the tanning salon

Jay checks it out nods

JAY
Oh youre totally right

DWAYNE

Ive been thinking about it and I
want you to start off working the
counter Sounds like a demotion I
know but its an important position
Because were gonna be using code
words and shit For example if a
customer walks in and says he wants a
tan that just means he wants a tan
But if he says he wants a deluxe
tan that means a blow job and you
gotta get one of the girls in there
to suck him off You with me

JAY
So far But what if he wants a fuck

DWAYNE
Theres gonna be codes for everything
missionary anal black chicks I
got it all written down back home in
my files

Im not gonna bother getting into it

Will navigates the streets Chet is in the back seat where

he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air
pistols and much of the car black

WILL
Be careful youre getting paint
everywhere

CHET

Are you really worried about your
upholstery right now

WILL
Yes because if I survive this shit
Im quitting my job That means
Ill probably have to give up my
place and Ill be sleeping in the
back of my car which youre covering
in toxic paint

Chet touches up one of the guns goes to flip it over

WILL
That side isnt dry yet Youre
about to ruin it

CHET
It says its fast drying

WILL
Fast isnt the same as instant You
gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes

CHET
How would you know You do a lot of
graffiti

WILL

No but I spray painted my bike last
year after I got my license suspended
I didnt let it dry properly and I
fucked it up

CHET
We dont have time to sit around and
literally watch paint dry Arent
we going straight to the bank

WILL
I was actually thinking we need to
stop and steal a car first

Chet drops the spray paint whirls on Will

CHET
What No way Weve got a car

WILL
Yeah my car Im not gonna use it
as a getaway vehicle They can trace
the plates Even if we do get away
well be arrested

CHET
Well I cant hotwire a fucking
automobile and neither can you

WILL
fq

Thats why I was thinking wed steal
one from your parents friends The
Fishers Remember how they used to
pay us to clean their garage They
leave the keys in there And they
have a Datsun Thats a fast car

CHET
m not stealing the Fishers Datsun
Lets steal a car from your parents
friends

Will seethes He whips the car over to the side of the road
and gets in Chets face

WILL
What friends My parents dont have
any My dad moved away after your
big mouth ruined his marriage and
humiliated him and no one wanted to
hang out with the mom who everyone
knew fucked a lifeguard

CHET
You never should have told me I
was 13 years old I couldnt process
that kind of information I had to
tell someone else
(shakes his head)
Fuck I really am sorry about it
Okay Despite what I said before
I was just a kid but I messed up

WILL
Okay

Chet looks at Will expectantly

CHET
Thats it Youre not gonna apologize
for selling my Cal Ripken ball

WILL
Sure Im sorryIm sorry that my
family was going through a rough patch
and I was smoking a ton of weed and
listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the
time And that I needed some extra
dough to indulge my habit Which in
hindsight was probably just a cry
for help But you never even noticed
CHET
Thanks Now I feel even worse

Will sits there stewing for a moment Then he softens -

WILL
I shouldnt have stolen the ball I
knew it was wrong and I regretted it
like the next day I actually tried
to buy it back but the guy wanted
twice as much I had to smoke even
more weed just to get past the whole
shitty incident I guess thats why
they call it a downward spiral

CHET
I appreciate that you tried to buy
it back So thanks

An awkward moment passes

CHET
We should probably get going

Will turns back around goes to pull out without looking and

A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at
them Will slams the brakes barely avoiding a collision

that is slightly jarring

WILL

KATE

of an incredibly complicated and fucked
up situation so please be cool

WILL

A whole lot of shit Im sorry to do
this to you but I was afraid Id never

know you have feelings for me too
Maybe you feel for me the way you feel
for a good friend or - if the world
fucking hates me - a brother

(MORE)

WILL (CONTD)
But what I hope is that you dont really
know how you feel for me and that
maybe when you figure it out youll
realize its the same way I feel for
you Does that make any sense

KATE
Yes I mean Ive known you forever
Its not an easy thing to figure out

WILL
I dont need an answer now Just

Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage while

Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper
Dwayne

holds up a mirror to check out his work

DWAYNE
Never comes out this nice when I do
it myself You might wanna take some

logical pattern of thought I bet

In the shadow of the nearby shed the minivan is revealed as
its interior lights come on The door opens and Dwayne
emerges in his mask

DWAYNE

Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground He
looks at the timer

Dwayne grins

DWAYNE
In the van Maybe

WILL
Get her out here Youre wasting time

Will grips the bag close to him

Dwayne whistles The minivan door opens and Jay steps out
Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his

A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-
like device in his hand

Jay helps Kate still bound and blindfolded out of the van
They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him

KATE
Will are you there

WILL
Im here Its gonna be okay

DWAYNE
This is a fucking tearjerker

WILL
Just let her come over here

DWAYNE
I will But you should know my
associate over there is packing a

Jay aims the metal device he has been holding He hits a
button and a pilot light comes on

JAY

(FLAT)
Just do what we say Dont mess
around or anything

DWAYNE
Unless either of you can outrun a 25-
foot flame
(gestures to gun in his belt)
Or a bullet

Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
forward Will grabs her pulls her blindfold off and pushes
her behind him

WILL
Get back

DWAYNE
I gave you the girl Now give me
the money

WILL
How about we get the code out of the

DWAYNE

Will keys in the numbers The timer freezes and the lock at
the hinge opens Will carefully extricates himself from the
vest He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it
His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat

Will takes a final look at the money bag then throws it to
Dwayne He looks inside smiles Jay takes a peak
DWAYNE
Its so fucking pretty aint it

JAY
Yeah Its awesome

Dwayne looks up at Will

DWAYNE
Okay you can get out of here now

WILL
I actually have this sneaking
suspicion that once we turn around
youre gonna put a bullet in both of
our backs - and this is just a guess -
burn our bodies

DWAYNE
They say great minds think alike
And in this case so do we

WILL
I figured as much Thats why I got
a gun pointed at you too

(LOUDLY)
I got a sniper in the bushes locked
on you right now

DWAYNE
Do I look that dumb

WILL
I cant tell youre wearing a mask

Before Dwayne can react he stops and blinks something
shining in his eyes

JAY
Heyon your forehead

Dwaynes eyes turn upward just barely making out the red
dot that dances on his forehead

DWAYNE
Son of a bitch Well played

In the bushes hidden from sight Chet carefully aims his
laser pointer at Dwaynes forehead
Will grins at Dwayne

WILL
Were gonna walk out of here now
If you shoot my sniper shoots I
cant guarantee hell get both of
you But hell definitely get you

As Will turns away -

VAUGHN (0S)
Hold the fuck up

Vaughn emerges from the darkness He looks at Will

VAUGHN
Wasnt expecting to see you here

Without warning Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
butt of his gun He goes down hard Kate screams Vaughn
points the gun at her and she shuts up

Dwayne steps forward with the bag

DWAYNE
Its all good We got your money

VAUGHN
Nice mask Dwayne Now throw the
money over here

Dwayne complies As soon as the bag lands Vaughn aims the
gun at him

DWAYNE
Hold up You dont have to do this

Kate looks on terrified an unconscious Will at her side
Vaughns eyes burn a hole through Dwayne

VAUGHN
Ive been hit with a pipe shot with a
pen and wasted my whole motherfucking
dayall because of you and this job

DWAYNE
I dont know what youre talking about
Just take the money
VAUGHN
I will And then Im gonna tie up the
two loose ends in the gorilla masks

DWAYNE
Im not a loose end

VAUGHN
Youre a fucking idiot You are as
loose as ends get

Panicked Dwaynes eyes flash over to Jay who tightens his
grip on the flamethrower handle Jay catches Dwaynes eye
Dwayne nods Vaughn sees this

VAUGHN
What the -

Jay rears up with the flamethrower Vaughn couldnt be more
surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
ball of fire at him

Vaughn dives to the ground fires off two wild shots one of
WHICH -

Nails Dwayne in the shoulder spinning him backward and
knocking him off his feet

Kate recoils in horror as Vaughn scurries madly on the
ground intermittently firing while Jay screams and tries
to torch him with the 25-foot flame A hand touches Kates
shoulder and she whirls around to find -

KATE
Chet What are you doing here

CHET
Not now We gotta take off
(LOOKS AROUND)
Wheres Will

Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was
Flames inches from him Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -

Good news the bullet only grazes Jays side Bad news it
keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack
which happens to be filled with gasoline which happens to
have an incredibly low flash point So the spark from say
a bullet would cause
AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES

Meanwhile Will pops up behind Chet and Kate clutching the
garbage bag

WILL
I got the money Lets get the fuck
out of here

They take off toward Wills car

Dwayne groggily comes tono SOUND just a ringing The
first thing he sees Vaughn storming toward him god-knows-
what spewing from his mouth Vaughn levels his gun -

It doesnt make a sound for two reasons The second being
that its out of bullets

Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware Muzzle flash

Vaughn drops to his knees Pulse snatched from him

SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jays screams Dwayne looks
over to see his friend in flames flailing his arms and
shrieking Dwaynes head snaps to the other side where he
sees the Mustangs tires peel He tears off his mask
frantically looks around The money is gone

DWAYNE
No

Jay disentangles himself from the backpack the source of
the flames but his clothes are now ablaze In his frenzy
he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -

JAY
Dwayne Help

Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
driveway He looks to Jay then to his minivan Dwaynes
face Two roads diverge in a wood Which to take

DWAYNE
Goddamn it Jay

Dwayne sprints over to Jay rips off his jacket and uses it
to beat the flames down

DWAYNE
Stop drop and roll
Jay hits the deck Dwayne continues fighting the flames
finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
smothers the last of them out

Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes

JAY
You came back for meyou said you
never would

DWAYNE
You didnt hesitate back there Jay
You did good

Jay smiles Flames overtake the field all around them

DWAYNE
Im gonna go put a bullet in that
motherfucker and get our money

feet and limps off toward the woods

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

An explosion rocks the minivan from inside The back end is
lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself It
lands on its roof and skids into a ditch

window They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive

Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan The shattered
windshield sprouts another crackthen another as -

Dwaynes foot kicks it out He drags himself from the
smoldering steel carcass He is a charred blood splattered
mess but he is alive

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Dwayne is propped up against a sign lingering on the edge
of consciousness The headlights of a lone pickup truck
approach Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride
INT NICE HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through He has made it
home He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut

From where his head has landed on the floor Dwayne sees
something oddlong red streaks He crawls forward on all
fours to investigate

It is a trail of sticky red blood Dwayne follows it until
he comes upon its sourcethe crumpled body of his father
lying face down Dwaynes face shock and confusion and joy

DWAYNE

Dwayne inches closer pokes the body Nothing

DWAYNE

The body emits a low groan Dwayne rolls it over His
fathers face is white hes lost a lot of blood but he
isnt totally spent yet He struggles to speak -

the phone table The Major dragged himself the whole way

The Major looks up at Dwaynes bruised face as if for the
first time

MAJOR

Dwaynes eyes well up He reaches out cradles his father
as he expires Its like a very bloody white trash version

of the Pieta Dwayne sobs uncontrollably until -

He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some
approximation of a life saving resuscitation

DWAYNE

nearer

But they are pushed to one side of the screen as the other
side is filled with -
A lo-fi 2001-style light tunnel It deposits us in the
furthest reaches of the galaxy where we find -

A tanning bed Rotating in orbit Dwaynes voice booms and
REVERBERATES -

The tanning bed explodes like a star gone supernova From
the light and fire and chaosemerges a logo

unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall
storefront We are watching a local commercial with
appropriately poor production value

and trying not to trip -

DWAYNE
Here at Major Tan our specially
trained technicians are hard at work
developing new technologies that
harness the power of the sun to
ensure a cutting-edge tanning
experience

Dwayne enters a tanning room A man in a lab coat stares
down at a clipboard on which a complicated scientific
equation is written

DWAYNE
Hows it looking

The man turns its Jay His smiling face is speckled with
healing burn wounds

JAY
Its our most advanced tanning bed

He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed

DWAYNE

Dwayne snaps his fingers A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him
disappear then reappear with a totally orange tan

DWAYNE

We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway
DWAYNE
But Major Tan isnt just about looking

good Its also about feeling good

Dwayne gestures to another room The door opens and Juicy
saunters out in a bikini A beat later a RANDOM GUY exits
