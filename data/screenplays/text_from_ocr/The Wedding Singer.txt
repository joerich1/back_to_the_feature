WEDDING SINGER DRAFT REVISED 931996

OPEN ON

Rock Lobster playing over black Reveal ROBBIE HART
playing at a packed wedding reception as credits roll After
all the dancing and credits the song ends the audience
applauds

ROBBIE
And now the best man is going to say a
few words

We hear polite applause

The following is SUPERIMPOSED at the bottom of the screen
FEBRUARY 7th 1985

INT RECEPTION HALL - DAY - CONT ACTION

As the camera PANS inside we see well-dressed men women and
children (dressed 1985) seated in groups at big round tables
We hear another voice

GUY
Um when Greg asked me to be his best
man I uh I mean I said yes right away
but I was kind of nervous

The toast goes on and on We PAN past a bored bartender a
photographer snapping pictures various guests starting to
lose interest the GUY at the microphone

GUY
I mean Gregs my brother man Hes
really been there for me I mean when I
was in rehab when I had that problem
with my car When I got the baby-sitter
pregnant

a goofy uncle with a video camera guests kicking each
other under the table bridesmaids rolling their eyes and the
BRIDE looking distressed Finally as the toast reaches a
sort of crescendo of pointlessness the camera comes to rest
on the GROOM his eyes narrowed in dull hate

The groom stands up and the camera follows him across the

floor as he walks over to the bandstand There standing
patiently smiling is the wedding singer ROBBIE HART

GUY (0C)
--I got a lot of feelings inside me
man and Greg was the only one the only
one to say Hey fuck everyone else
You got to let those feelings out or your
heads gonna explode

The groom leans over and whispers in Robbies ear Robbie
nods

GUY
I mean Im a person too Dad God damn it
Im a person too

He grabs a glass of water and then his mic
Robbie cuts off the GUY in mid-toast

ROBBIE
(very up)
And a great person you are The best man
everyone Salud

Robbie raises his glass and everyone in the thankful crowd
follows suit The tension is broken

ROBBIE

Love is really a miracle when you think
about it Here are two people that were
born apart raised and educated apart and
then through some extra-terrestrial or
voodoo or something found one another and
made that major vow to remain together
And here we all are to basically gawk at

the courage and and faith it takes
to make these vows to stay together
forever

The BRIDE and GROOM sigh with relief the entire room fills
with the warmth generated by Robbies love inspiring speech

ROBBIE
And I want you to know that even if you
only stay together for forty or fifty
years Ill still be incredibly
impressed But the way you two look at
each other and smile at each other I got
a feeling a thousand years wouldnt be
enough for you Cheers

Robbie cues the band they start thumping out a tune A guy
named TIMMY is on bass a guy named JIMMY is playing drums
and a young woman in a billowy yellow dress named ERICA
wearing at least three scarves is wailing away on guitar

ROBBIE
Now on behalf of Mr and Mrs Harold
Fonda Id like to ask everyone to get on
the dance floor and - celebrate
(singing)
CEL-E-BRATE GOOD TIMES - COME ON

As Robbie continues singing Kool and the Gangs
Celebration we PAN TO a door just to the left of the
stage JULIA SULLIVAN a young waitress comes blasting
through it two plates of prime rib in each hand

LAWRENCE aka Dr Limo the limo driver Robbies best friend
sidles over to PHIL the photographer Lawrence points to
Robbie

LAWRENCE
The maestro does it again He has an
incredible instinct for the quick save in
a human drama

PHIL
Maybe he should be taking psychology
instead of you

LAWRENCE
Interesting point But Id like to change
the subject now to that waitress over
there and her great body

PHIL
She must be new

LAWRENCE
Brand spanking new

PHIL
Im sure shed appreciate you talking
about her like shes a car

Julia precariously navigates her way through the crowd
finally arriving at the furthest table

JULIA
Okay who wanted the prime rib

Everyone just stares at her

on JULIA
Nobody wanted prime rib

Everyone shakes their head

JULIA
This table is all fish

Everyone nods

JULIA
Be right back

Julia starts making her way back to the kitchen with the four
plates Robbie finishes up his song Applause

ROBBIE
(genuinely enjoying himself)
Well all right Hey you guys dance
nice You know something folks Im
getting married myself next Saturday

Applause
ROBBIE
Hey thanks So I just want to say that
on I hope that my wedding will be as special

as Harold and Claudias
Applause and awwwwws
ROBBIE
I really do mean that One Two Three
Four
The band launches into Everlasting Love
INT RECEPTION HALL KITCHEN DAY

Julia yells over to the chef

JULIA
Four fish

Julias cousin HOLLY who is also a waitress comes over
Even though Hollys wearing the same uniform that Julia is
she wears it a lot more va-va-va-voomishly

HOLLY
Hows your first night going cuz

JULIA
You remember Mondale against Regan

HOLLY
Dont worry once we get the entrees
served its all downhill Coffee and
cake is a breeze

Holly notices that Julia is near tears

HOLLY
Oh Julia its really not so bad You
just say regular or decaf

JULIA
Its not that Holly Glen hasnt called
me in a couple of days and with my track
record Im Mondale Its over

HOLLY
Only you could be this pretty and manage
to find guys that treat you badly I
mean just because dip shit hasnt called
doesnt mean hes ended it with you
Besides lets say he did it’s not the
end of the world Everybodys been
dumped Look at me

JULIA
Not by dozens of men

HOLLY
You havent been dumped by dozens of men

JULIA
One Brian Went to jail for
embezzlement Two Bob Said I didnt
love him because I wouldnt get fake
implants Three Scott said he dumped
me because he didnt want to be-
monogamous but it turned out he was gay

HOLLY
(ruefully)
Have you ever thought of trying out one
of those computer dating services

JULIA
Five Danny After ten months he said I
looked too much like his sister And now
it looks like Glen is number six Two
years of my life wasted

The Chef roughly slides four plates in Julias direction

CHEF
Four fish

As Julia struggles to pick up the plates she speaks softly
to Holly

JULIA
I thought me and Glen had something
special Then again I thought I had
something special with all those guys
except maybe Scott Im just so sick of
being somebodys latest girlfriend you
know Im ready for something more than
that My mother thinks I shouldve been
married at least two years ago She
thinks Im going to end up by myself
watching re-runs of Rhoda with my
nineteen cats

INT RECEPTION HALL - DAY
Robbie finishes up Everlasting Love” Applause

ROBBIE
Thank you That was Everlasting Love”
a special dedication to the bride from
Eddie Davis

CUT TO the GROOM giving the BRIDE a suspicious look

ROBBIE
Were gonna lay a little change of pace
on you right now Our guitarist Erica
Lamonsoff is gonna sing an original song
of hers called Moon Child Take it
away Erica

As Robbie bounds off the stage Erica steps up to the mic and
begins singing a horrible Stevie Nicks-ish original

ERICA
(singing)
DRUIDS DANCING NEATH THE STARS NO MORE
FAMINE NO MORE WARS

Robbie is walking towards the mens room when someone grabs
his arm stopping him in his tracks

ALEC
Hey Robbie remember me 1 went to high
school with you

ROBBIE
Yeah I do No I dont I mean maybe I
mean Do I

ALEC
Ah you probably dont Im two years
younger than you I graduated in °81
But I was a huge fan of the band man
You guys rocked Remember when you
Played at homecoming and the cops came

ROBBIE
(smiling at the memory)
Yeah that night got a little outta hand

ALEC

What happened to you guys You were the
best local band I ever heard I thought

ROBBIE

ALEC

ALEC
Congratulations man Thats great

ROBBIE

(meaning it)
Yeah That is great

ALEC
Hey remember that song Blood of the
Goat you used to do That was great
Do you still write stuff like that

Robbie looks around kind of embarrassed

ROBBIE
Well Im concentrating on writing some
more serious stuff You know like
meaningful

In the background Erica screeches out the chorus Her song
is neither meaningful nor good

ROBBIE
I didnt write this one

ALEC
You must be a good writer though You
could probably write a song and sell it
to a huge band like Foreigner or
something

ROBBIE
Maybe someday The songs I write now
arent really polished

Robbie trails off as he sees a TEENAGER across the room
clinging on to the wall for dear life

ROBBIE
Excuse me for a second

Robbie walks across the room to the Teenager who is drunk

ROBBIE
You all right man
TEENAGER
(far gone)
Huh
ROBBIE

You have to throw up

TEENAGER
Yes please

INT RECEPTION HALL KITCHEN - DAY

Robbie his arm propping up the Teenager guides him through
the kitchen

ROBBIE
Code Red Code Red

Everyone gets out of their way
EXT BACK DOORWAY - DAY

The back entrance to the reception hall is a battered screen
door at the top of stone steps surrounded by dumpsters
Julia is sitting on the top step taking a cigarette break
the sound of the reception muted in the distance

Another sound that of rushing footsteps can be faintly
heard but gets louder and louder until

Robbie rushes through the door with the Teenager blowing
past Julia He sticks the Teenagers head into one of the
dumpsters the Teenager starts to retch

Julia and Robbie make eye contact Boing For a few
seconds the only sound is the Teenagers retching ‘Then

JULIA
Friend of yours

ROBBIE
Me No I just saw what was about to
happen I couldnt let him do this in
front of his friends andor family You
know the sound of vomiting doesnt tend
to enhance any party particularly a
wedding

Julia smiles

JULIA
Well Im glad I got to hear it

The Teenager finishes retching Robbie pulls his head out of
the dumpster

ROBBIE
So are you ever going to drink again
kid

TEENAGER

No man never

The Teenager staggers back inside

ROBBIE

(shouting after him)
Good Remember alcohol equals puke
equals smelly mess equals nobody likes
you Equals driving under the influence
equals drunk tanks equals rehab equals
Ray Milland in Lost Weekend equals liver
transplant equals do you really want to
completely destroy your life

The Teenagers gone Robbie and Julia are alone

JULIA
Youre the wedding singer arent you
ROBBIE
Yep
JULIA
Im working your wedding next week
ROBBIE
Oh thats nice
JULIA

‘JULIA
Could you do me a favor

ROBBIE

JULIA

ROBBIE
Well if I do can I keep it Cause its a
nice head with nice hair Why whats
wrong

JULIA
I just moved to this crummy town to be
closer to my boyfriend and now I think
hes dumped me

ROBBIE
Oh Im sorry but hey he wasnt the
right one then The right one for you
must still be out there

JULIA
The right one for me must have skipped
over me and settled for a college grad
with a good job that comes from a wealthy
family Im doomed to wander the earth
alone forever

ROBBIE
Like the Incredible Hulk

JULIA
Yeah Only not helping people

ROBBIE
I saw you in there helping people giving
them fish and coffee and forks Cmon
people cant eat without forks just like
people cant live without real love And
for that youll need your head

JULIA
(laughs)
And once youve got a head you need
silverware especially forks

ROBBIE
(laughs)
What does that mean

JULIA
(laughs)
I dont know you lost me back at the
Hulk

Suddenly Erica is running down the hallway

ERICA

Erica grabs Robbie and starts dragging him away

i JULIA
Well if I have to serve fish at least I

Erica walk quickly toward them Halfway there Robbie sees
something the Bride and Groom hidden from general view
having a heated discussion

”™ GROOM
Why did Eddie Davis dedicate that song to
you
BRIDE

crazy fantasy of his

GROOM
All fantasies have a basis in reality

Hearing this Robbie suddenly makes a detour to talk to the
best man

ROBBIE
‘ Whats their song

GUY

ROBBIE

Their song The song that they fell in
love to

GUY
Oh I think its that Wham song

band They stop playing for second then start playing a
different slower melody

A black stretch limo with JIMMY and TIMMY in the back is
parked in the driveway

ROBBIE
Hey manthanks for the thought but I
told you I aint going to any bachelor
party tonight Linda would be really
upset if I did that

LAWRENCE
Well Ill be really upset if you dont

ROBBIE
All a bachelor party can do for me is
negative There are no positives it can
bring me

LAWRENCE
Well it can positively get a stripper to
bring me a boner So get in the God
damned car and let ushave some fun

HE grabs Robbie and forcibly throws him into the limo It
immediately speeds away

EXT SEEDY BAR - NIGHT - LATER

Robbie leaves his bachelor party in full swing As he opens
the door in the background we can see Lawrence on all fours
getting spanked by a fat older stripper He is moaning way
too much His other friends are drinking and dancing with
strippers in the background

Robbie closes the door on this scene and heads up the block
to

EXT LINDAS HOUSE - NIGHT - A SHORT TIME LATER

Robbie saunters up the sidewalk eager to see his bride
Music can be heard comming from the house Robbie crosses to
the front door and knocks Linda opens the door in her
wedding dress

LINDA
What are you doing here

ROBBIE
Hi Man you look unbelievable
LINDA
(interrupts)

Dont you know that its illegal to see
the bride the night before the wedding

ROBBIE

LINDA
(interrupts)

ROBBIE

bottomless pit I dont want to take
any risks So if you dont mind GO
AWAY Good night

Closing the door Robbie stops the door from closing He
looks stricken

LINDA

EXT RECEPTION HALL - FOLLOWING DAY

Angie Julias mother drives up with Julia dropping her off
for work Angie is about 48 attractive but bitter Life has
not treated her that well

The car pulls up to the entrance where there is an easel with
photographs of Linda and Robbie announcing that this is the
location of their wedding Angie looks at the pictures

JULIA
Okay mom thanks alot Ill see you

ANGIE
(interrupting)

Look at the picture of that girl See
that Youre alot prettier than that girl
and here shes getting married and youre
still single Its disgusting

JULIA

ANGIE
(interrupting)
Julia youre not getting any younger
You need to find a man before your looks
start to fade and your selection of mates
becomes more limited

JULIA
But mom you didnt get married til you

ANGIE
Thats part of my point If I married at
twenty six I couldve found a better guy
than your father who wouldnt have left

hes charming

JULIA
He hasnt called me mom How can I marry
someone that doesnt call me Look could
we talk about this later Ive got to go

ANGIE
(interrupting)
Then call him Get down off your proud
high horse and let him know you care

JULIA

That was in my day Your generation is
alot more androgynous Females are more
manly and males are more feminine Look

Julia leans over and kisses her

JULIA

INT WEDDING HALL - DAY

Its beautifully decorated and full of people theres
definitely a wedding taking place

ADVANCE up the aisle past the guests up to the altar right

into an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the groom - Robbie He is
smiling broadly happy confident and proud

But then the first trace of something bad appears in his
eyes Soon the smile seems phony it doesnt match the sad
eyes The music abruptly stops

The JUSTICE OF THE PEACE leans over and whispers in Robbies
ear

JUSTICE OF THE
PEACE
Perhaps we should call the bride

Robbies stares down the aisle toward the daylight streaming
in from the back door of the temple

ROBBIE
Something mustve happened I mean maybe
the car broke down or shes stuck in
traffic oror theres a problem
with her make up or dress or something
I know her she likes to always look her
best

Robbie seems to be in a trance dreamily smiling and staring
up the aisle

After a few seconds Robbies older sister KATE enters from
a side door and walks across the otherwise silent church to
Robbie

KATE
(interrupts)
Robbie
ROBBIE
(still smiling)
Hi Sis
KATE

ERICA

KATE
He was like this after we lost our

CUT TO
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Julia is walking down the sidewalk a bag of groceries in
each hand Shes listening to a Walkman She is sadly
singing along to Foreigners Ive Been Waiting For A Girl
Like You

In the BACKGROUND behind her we see a horse-drawn carriage
enter from a side street and turn onto the street shes
walking down The horse is moving fast Faint clipclops
get louder the carriage gets closer Finally when Julia
stops at an intersection the carriage catches up The
horses head is only a few feet from Julia

The horse whinnies really loud Startled Julia turns and
sees the carriage Its being driven by a toothless old
CARRIAGE DRIVER The only passenger is a devilishly handsome
young man with a fistful of roses GLEN GUGLIA

GLEN
Ta-da
JULIA
Glen You scared me
GLEN
Sorry Cmon Climb in I have I

question for you

Robbie moves through customers and salesman Enthusiasm and
hawking fill the air He comes to the door of Joseph Brunk
Manager and knocks

Joseph Brunk is on the phone He is a highly energetic
salesman As he talks he waves Robbie in and motions him to
sit in a chair across from his desk

JOSEPH
(continuing into phone)
Look I feel bad for the lady but her
husband signed the contract Its not my
fault

He winks at Robbie conspiratorially Robbie squirms in his
chair

(continuing holding out his
hand)
Joseph Brunk what can I do you for
ROBBIE

JOSEPH
Yes yes The singing teacher So you
want to be a franchisee
ROBBIE
I think so
JOSEPH

Gotta do better than that We gotta
convince these people that were doing
them a favor to let them part with their
money in exchange for some immeasurable
musical skills Subtle perhaps to the
laymen but to the truly musical their
talent is finally exposed A price cant
be put on that But we reluctantly do
Costly but fair Think you wanna join our
team

ROBBIE
Uh hows the pay

JOSEPH
Man after my own heart The pay is great
Heres what we do everyone signs a
contract for thirty lessons in advance
If they cant pay fuck em Theyll only
show up for three anyway We have a no
money back policy so were all set We
guarantee results but were businessmen
You see Robbie its not just that you
teach people how to sing and make money
Its that you make money and occasionally
teach people how to sing Franchises are
the future

forget the past

time tonight The kids are in good hands

Robbie shuts the door on Andy and is left alone with the
kids The kids are running around

INT RECEPTION HALL NIGHT

Robbie is on stage with the band singing Lets Stay
Together in a haunting hopeful way The audience dances
and listens It is the end of the night Julia clears the
tables with Holly and the other girls

ROBBIE

(sings continuing)
BABY LETS STAY TOGETHER LOVIN’ YOU
WHETHER WHETHER TIMES RE GOOD OR BAD

ALOT OF PEOPLE BREAK UP TURN AROUND AND

(MORE)

ROBBIE (contd)
MAKE UP THATS NOT FOR ME LET ME BE
THE ONE YOU COME RUNNING TO YOU MAKE ME
FEEL SO BRAND NEW BABE

A drunken heckler from the crowd interrupts him

DRUNKEN HECKLER
(interrupting)
Hey lets hear something a little
livelier huh man This song is bumming
me out big time

Robbie and the band stop

ROBBIE
Im sorry this song is bringing you down
But there are other ways to celebrate
than getting drunk and shaking your ass
Although Ive been known to do both of
those things In case youve forgotten
were here at a wedding Were here to
celebrate union and possibility and joy
And I dont know anybody that does it
better than Al Green Instead of dulling
our senses or moving faster than we
really feel like moving isnt it nice to
slow to a gentle pace where we can
appreciate gazing into another persons
eyes who loves you like yous like to
love yourself Lets Stay Together
feels like a song written in moonlight
Its a blessing a prayer that the best
we feel when were side by side with the
one we love will last throughout our
lives

Julia listens spellbound

ROBBIE

(continuing)
So if you dont mind Im going to finish
this song celebrating the promise made
here today After which I will be singing
Play That Funky Music White Boy which
is probably a little bit more to your
liking

The heckler smiles

ROBBIE
(continuing)
LETS LETS STAY TOGETHER LOVIN
YOU WHENEVER TIMES ARE GOOD OR BAD OR
HAPPY OR SAD BABY

There are tears in Julias eyes
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT - A SHORT TIME LATER

JULIA

JULIA
That wasnt pretentious it was poetic

ROBBIE
You think I just cant stand anyone

heart out for us right

JULIA
Its a beautiful song And after that I
definitely want you to sing that at my
wedding

———e—oT

ROBBIE
Oh look Id love to but Im kind of
phasing out of the wedding business

JULIA
Really No You cant youre so so
good I mean you almost had me crying in
there

ROBBIE
No that wasnt me That was Al Green I
just sang it I mean Id love to write a
song like that One that people hear with

“Hey Ive felt what that guy has felt
I used to think I could do that but now
Im not so sure

JULIA
Sure you could Wedding Singer Did you’
see how you just entranced them out
there I mean if you can do that you can
do anything

ROBBIE
Well thats a really nice thing to

Robbie starts to say something

INT PRIESTS OFFICE - DAY

Julia and Glen sit in front of the desk of a man of the
cloth Overhead is the glowing soft light of a stained glass
window of the Virgin Mary and the word SACRIFICE The Priest
is a grey haired benevolent man with wire rimmed glasses

JULIA
(continuing)
I thought we could use that Al Green
song You know the one
PRIEST

Love and Happiness

JULIA
hets Stay Together

GLEN
Yeah thats kind of a groovy song but
dont you think we should have something
less whiney and more upbeat

JULIA
You think Al Green is whiney

PRIEST

(clears throat)
I think these details can be determined
in a more appropriate context Today we
need to focus on other matters The
church views marriage as a sacrament a
holy union before God unbreakable for
all eternity Glen did you think about
the importance of your decision before
you asked Julia to marry you

The Priest notes this in the file then looks up closes the
file folds his hands and smiles

GLEN
Well yeah I mean I got everything
going pretty good so its time to start
planting some seeds ya know And with
Julia here Ill have some great lookin
kids

PRIEST
I see What about you Julia Have you
carefully considered the gravity of your
decision to wed

JULIA

(nervous and excited)
Yes Father Quinn I have A wedding is
something every girl looks forward to her
whole life Its not something to be
taken lightly its a huge emotional
commitment All your friends are there
all your whole family they print an
announcement in the newspaper -

PRIEST
(cutting her off)
Julia Im talking about the marriage
itself about actually being Glens wife
not about the wedding The wedding is
really just a symbolic ritual

GLEN
Im with you your holiness I mean
after a few months the weddings
forgotten and all you have is an album
of pictures you never look at and a dress
shell never wear again

Julia looks at Glen like she wants to kill him

Beat

PRIEST
It sounds like you have mixed feelings
about the wedding Glen

GLEN
Well Id rather go to Vegas and save the
money so we could buy a bigger boat

GLEN
(continuing)
But still we can have a big wedding and
all if thats what Julia decides she
wants Its her big day and everything
Whatever makes her happy

is holding a bizarre flower arrangement

FLORIST

(very intensely)
-now wed make up one of these babies
for each table The daisy represents
innocence and the black-eyed susan
represents of course lost innocence
This barren branch here represents the
barrenness of your lives before you found
each other while this weed

Julia and Robbie looking on dubiously as the florist
continues Julia leans over and whispers to Robbie

JULIA
You sure shes the best in town I feel
like I just joined a cult or something
The florist sees her whispering

FLORIST
Excuse me Am I boring you folks
