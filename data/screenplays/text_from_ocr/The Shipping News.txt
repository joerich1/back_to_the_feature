INT LAUNDROMAT MOCKINGBURG NEW YORK - NIGHT

Glaring fluorescence trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes
empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange Only two dryers are
humming Its very late Keep PANNING to

a wiry gimlet-eyed WOMAN furtively removing crumpled
newspapers from a dryer She flattens and folds them meticulously
her glance darting angrily everywhere Top secret mission

a natty little black man PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on
a neat cloth atop a dryer Small cold fowl Brie baguette
olives Bottle of red An air of competence of indomitable
upbeatness He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were
normal More curious about

a hulking rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if
cramming for lifes midterm exam Thoughtful Circles one
slowly Set out on QUOYLEs dryer are one Snickers bar and four
empty snickers wrappers His version of cold supper He reaches
for the candy but seeing its the last one he

rvises Goes to the candy machine Drops in his 65 cents hits
the button The Snickers starts to fall but gets caught in the
mechanism at the last moment Quoyle blinks dully One more
retelling of the story of his life He BANGS the machine half-
heartedly Nope Shakes it with his shambling strength Nada
POUNDS the coin return button Hat trick He empties his pocket
Studies the results Not enough And without so much as a sigh

-he ambles back to his dryer Starts to unwrap the last
Snickers Partridge taking this all in But Mata Hari of the
Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine KICKS it violently Out
fall the Snickers and the 65 cents She scoops up both turns in a
single motion to

GLARE death at the enemy Quoyle opens his mouth to comment
But Doesnt Resumes unwrapping his supper as

-his dryer STOPS He pops it open Stares in Blinks
Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor
to reveal they have been

STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen quietly melting amid the
pile This slips beneath even Quoyles expectation level The
big soft face is pitifully yes even adorably devastated

QUOYLE (a murmur)
Ruined

And to the bystander This seems a comment on more than shirts

PARTRIDGE (softly)
Nah Rub the ink with hot salt and
talcum powder

Quoyles head WHIPS around As if he thought he was alone

QUOYLE (VO)
f youre shocked when someone aims
indness your way That oughta tell
you somethin about yourself

Watches the little guys undemanding smile
QUOYLE (VO just staring)

Then again If youre that kinda
guy It dont

fq

PARTRIDGE
And put a cuppa bleach in next
time through

As Quoyle gazes at his benefactor the woman sneaks up SNATCHES
his Help Wanted ads Races them over to her dryer As the boys
watch she shoves them in starts the machine with Quoyles coins
and glares fiercely back at us A mother bear protecting her cubs
Partridge chuckles Holds out his hand

PARTRIDGE

Quoyle glances at the little mans cold fowl supper

QUOYLE

All the change SPILLS out of Quoyles pockets and CLATTERS onto
the wood floor ROLLING interminably as Quoyle fidgets

Quoyle looks up with innocent eyes Which makes Partridge
hesitate

QUOYLE (VO)
I knew we had our problems But
I never thought Id hear that word

She shivers with disgust Walks around in a frustrated circle

now

the tears are on his face She flashes her hardest look
And
yet

her slender fingers reach out Wipe his face not as roughly as
she might have intended

He stares at it His lips part But no sound comes Instead

walks the few steps to Bunnys room to find her

wide awake Sitting on the edge of her bed No question she
heard it all

So Quoyle smiles He reaches to the top of her battered armoire
His eyes damp but dancing for his daughter Pulls down

a box of chocolates Their stash He sits on the floor
Opens
the lid like buried treasure

She comes to cuddle in his lap He feeds her one She feeds him
one Theyve done this before As they chew

INT COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY

Quoyle moving his bulk FAST down a corridor a uniformed COP almost
skipping alongside to keep up watching Quoyle like a hawk all the
way to

the threadbare common room Kids playing arguing sleeping
staring at an antique TV Quoyle goes THROUGH them all cop
doggedly in his wake and sinks to his knees beside

BUNNY

Bunny on the ratty sofa legs dangling holding out a vintage
Gameboy She wears clean clothes freshly-washed hair anda
comfortable smile

QUOYLE (very soft)
Me neither

And kisses her lightly on the lips

of a practicing imp

DAISIES
He gives them to her Like her best beau

BUNNY
Wheres our candy

QUOYLE

consequences later The cop backs well off He can take a hint

BUNNY

And leans her forehead To rest against his

BUNNY

INT QUOYLES HOUSE - NIGHT

Quoyle stumbling toward the front door drawing his robe around
him Squinting through the peephole OPENING the door to
reveal

AGNIS
Nephew Im your Aunt Agnis Hamm

Tall and rawboned and 60 A rugged maybe even handsome face set
with ice-blue eyes Calm slightly scary eyes that drift to his
robe

AGNIS
You sick Its nine oclock
He is completely off-balance here

QUOYLE
Uh No Bunny and I like to
uh early to bed earl

AGNIS
Losin your wife your folks and
your jobd depress anybody Its
a wonder you dont sleep all day

Not that she seems to approve Not at all His eyes now drift to
the large well-used SUITCASES dangling from her powerful hands

AGNIS
Thought Id stay a day or two
Give you some relief with th

And stops The mouth doesnt smile But the eyes crinkle
slightly

toward

Bunny Who has crept out in her jammies Hugging a sack of

Pepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy

AGNIS (to Bunny)
You like blue dogs named Warren

The little girl nods As if she certainly does

AGNIS
I got one in the car

INT PARLOR - LATER

In the far corner of the room Bunny plays with WARREN a sweet
ugly dog Toothless and undeniably blue

QUOYLE (0S)
I never knew her really

See him now sipping his tea Wallowing in the detritus of his
emotions

QUOYLE
But she was driven by terrible
forces no one could understand
She was a locked door Even to me

Agnis in the good chair Teacup on her ample lap Assessing a
photo on the end table Petals arctic eyes rigidly seductive
pose The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its
jelly jar glass

AGNIS
So she wasnt just a bitch in
high heels

Quoyles eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter her innocence
protected by distance and absorption with Warrens passivity

AGNIS
Dont stress She mighta heard worse
from her momma Im only guessin

QUOYLE
Some people probably thought Petal
was bad clear through

AGNIS
People Are a cynical lot

QUOYLE
I think she just couldnt get
enough love

Agnis unblinking eyes

AGNIS
I think the evidence Is on
your side

The eyes study him Dissect him even

AGNIS
Im headed north Nephew to
where our family comes from in
Newfoundland Thought Id never
go back But the older yget

Clucks her tongue

AGNIS
Theres a pull Becomes an ache
As if where your people started
held a purpose for you Like
youre a piece in a puzzle

Not a smile But something A softening of timbre a flicker
behind the eye

AGNIS
lookin for where yfit
Lifts her cup

Takes a sip

Just like that

Hmmn

Tilts her head

He just stares

His face softens
this

AGNIS
You too

QUOYLE
In what sense do you m

AGNIS
You need to come Nephew

AGNIS
Nothin here but hurt You got
to start fresh everythins gone

AGNIS
The tripll clear your head
Be educational for the squirt
Teach ya the worlds still spinnin
outside this toxic slice oHades
And who knows

Who knows

AGNIS
They must have a newspaper up
there Somebodys gotta write it

The blankest of the blank

AGNIS
Tell the truth Id appreciate
the company You two are pretty
much my family

Hadnt thought of it that way

AGNIS
A pot ocoffee would hit the spot

Drop owhiskey would fit nice in it

She waits He rises And when he does

AGNIS

His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion

And seeing
Which ones my brother

He blinks She looks at two URNS on the mantle
QUOYLE
Uh Theres Mom And thats Poppa
The name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled He clears
his
throat
QUOYLE

Those are temporary

AGNIS
Coffee And maybe a sweet
Quoyle nods glad to serve Heads off to the kitchen Agnis
looks
at Bunny and Warren
AGNIS

She needs to go outside

BUNNY
I know why
She runs out the dog trotting after Alone now
-Agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse It

is an
oversized ZIPLOC BAG She stands Crosses to

her brothers urn She removes the lid Turns the huge Ziploc
upside down to COVER the urn Then in one deft movement

UPENDS the urn a cascade of ash tumbling into the Ziploc
Seals it Sets it to one side Then from her purse

another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes She pours
just enough into the urn That should do it Stashes the rest

back in her purse Turns now to lift

the Ziploc with her brothers remains Stares at it Think
Hamlet with Yorricks skull

AGNIS
What say Guy The dumpster

A beat Eyes flat and neutral

AGNIS
Just a thought

the wheel to run his hairy hands UNDER Petals dress while through
the shotgun window we see

-Quoyle FLYING along outside like a superhero Except he is
shocked bug-eyed by the tableau The disgusting driver buries his
face in Petals hair she throws her head back laughing and the
driver becomes Quoyles FATHER Quoyle silently SHRIEKING outside
the window and SMASH cut to

EXT DECK PORT-AUX-BASQUES FERRY - DAY

Quoyle blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry Fog

and cliff and the raw Atlantic And SOARING alongside an amazing
number of MARITIME BIRDSthe gulls and terns seeming to stare
Quoyle in the eye as they glide past Maybe they prompted his
dream

AGNIS (0S)
They draft off our air currents
its quite premeditated

She stands at the rail Smoking despite the wind

AGNIS
They actually know the ferry
schedule Show up on time
bettern the Newfies

He smiles a seasick smile Lurches from his bolted-down chair to
join her She nods back toward

Bunny through the glass window snuggled with Warren feeding
the dog french fries

AGNIS

Shes married to a falconer in
Arabia now Has to wear a black

thing over her face

QUOYLE
Like the falcon

She stares in his eyes Yes like the falcon They are grow
on
each other in a companionable way

AGNIS
Nice To be with family
He smiles It is nice
AGNIS

Specially big shots Who can
land a job with one phone call

His smile changes color A quiet pride in the modest

QUOYLE
Well that was my friend Partridge
Made the call And its just an
interview

When Quoyle looks back in at Bunny he sees she is staring off at
something with full attention He follows her gaze to

a honey-haired MOTHER with her small BOY snuggled in her lap
She is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness And
though the childs face is blissfully vacant she murmurs to him
with serious intent

INT CAR GREAT NORTHERN PENINSULA - DAY

Quoyle driving a winding rutted road high above the coastline
Cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes Long-abandoned settlements
jutting from raw granite Icebergs on the horizon above the
rumpled creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea Beside him

AGNIS
On the map here Quoyle Point
Named after us You

It all seems at once awe-inspiring frighteningly lonely And

hostile as hell
EXT QUOYLES POINT - SUNSET

The car pulls up in a shroud of mist Our family climbs out
stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud until

the fog LIFTS And like a ghost a GREEN HOUSE appears
disappears Then APPEARS again This time to stay

Then
AGNIS (bottomless pride)
I was born here

BUNNY
The green makes me hurl
(Warren whimpers)
Her too

The cloud lifts further and we see the house stands alone ona
rocky point The bay roils far below Half the window panes are
gone Holes in the roof paint flaking everywhere Lonely and
scary as any haunted house

AGNIS
Empty 44 years And look at that
roofline straight as a ruler

Quoyle looks at her Looks at the house Looks at her

QUOYLE
Take it easy Floor mighta fallen
into the cellar

AGNIS (laughs)
Not likely There is no cellar
No foundation neither

She takes Bunnys squirming hand and starts toward the house as if
crossing Jordan

AGNIS (calling back)
The whole things lashed with cable
to iron rings set in the rock

He just stands there Sees the cables now the rings

QUOYLE (calling out)
Uh Why would they do th

AGNIS (calling back)
Long story

Apparently a private one too Keeps walking

INT GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT

Inside the dank corroding place We can feel all 44 years of
abandonment CRASH The door FLIES open Quoyle with his tire

iron steps aside and

Agnis drags Bunny inside The wind shrieking low through
openings like proper spirits Even this bold child is frightened
So Agnis leans to murmur

AGNIS
Up those stairs Aunt Pinkie slept
So fat she couldnt get down to her
chamber pot Wanna see if shes
still there

Asked as a serious question Bunny nods Lets

ANGLEupstairs now Agnis marching through like MacArthur
reclaiming the Philippines Room after rough-hewn spacious room
light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes

AGNIS
Well Too late to drive that road
back round the bay Well camp
in here tonight Be right as rain

Quoyle looks down to his daughter Who nods as if that were a
perfectly natural suggestion

BUNNY
Which ones Petals room Tll
sleep there

great care Quoyle can breathe again shes safe Ambles out
crouches beside her Close

She keeps working Almost eerie concentration He sees now that
she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems connected by aluminum pop
tops He leans down Kisses her head

QUOYLE
Is that a belt or a crown

No answer That concerns him The intensity of her focus He
notices now the soda and beer cans with their tops popped Lined
up in a row He lifts one liquid sloshes out Theyre full

EXT GREEN HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home Agnis stands at the
back of a rented truck sorting through materials in the payload
Across a stretch of ground Bunny is earnestly pretend-reading a
book to Warren who lies listlessly before her

Quoyle comes up behind Agnis He carries a newspaper and an
excited air

QUOYLE
Listen to this Well we see
the postman has landed in jail for
45 days for throwing the mail in
Killick-Claw Harbor He said he
had too much to deliver and folks
could just take a dip and help
themselves

He looks up eager for her reaction She is still sorting through
bolts of thick cloth spools of heavy thread odd mechanical
devices

QUOYLE
This is great stuff A snowmobile
mishap has taken the life of 78-year-
old Rick Puff who was on his way
home from what the Widow Puff calls
a screech-in and a carouse when his
machine fell through the ice A well-
known accordion player Mr Puff had
served four years in the 1970s for
sexual assault on his daughters Bet

Quoyle nods Could be that The sudden sound of footsteps above
them makes him look up sharply to see

a fit young MAN in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the
roof The muscles of a stud the shy smile of a boy he waves a
greeting and HOPS down the last six feet to the ground

AGNIS
This is Dennis Buggit master
carpenter

DENNIS offers a hand and a smile that says hes expecting to like

Quoyle enters Billy Prettys on the phone hand cupped over the

shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought

EXT WAVEYS YARD - AFTERNOON

Quoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon A small house its grassy
yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures
galloping horses dogs balanced on wheels a row of chrome hubcaps
on sticks A zoo of the mind To one side a table piled with
crafts ignored by

fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions like bundled
unbridled banshees Looks like fun Two harried MOTHERS are
trying to cope with the chaos And there under a tree

the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry And in

the rain She is on her knees tying the shoes of her vacant-faced
SON He trips and sprawls but he is laughing The woman smiles
tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair

Quoyle gets up his courage Walks Bunny over to them As we
arrive the woman looks up

QUOYLE (really nervous)
Hullo Its our first day and I

Sure there is This is Herry and
he has Downs Syndrome It means
he learns things very slowly

Oh HERRY smiles at Bunny Suddenly wonderfully

BUNNY (to Herry)
Know how to be a dog

She DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier Herry
LAUGHS with delight Tumbles down to the grass and does his
impression of a Chihuahua on speed

BUNNY (to the woman)
He looks fast to me Maybe hes
cured

WOMAN
Maybe

The kids waddle off in their canine personas Alone with the woman
now Quoyle is near-catatonic Come on brain

QUOYLE
Which one of those women is in
charge here

The woman looks at him Clear cornflower eyes As comfortable in
silence as he is agonized Then she squints out at the other
women desperately running ragged after the kids

WOMAN
Neither of em Theyre just moms

Oh

QUOYLE
Well my lord whoever runs the
place should be giving this a
little more attention

She looks back at him blankly

WOMAN
You think
QUOYLE
I mean children need structure
No ones even guarding that craft
table they could be running around
with scissors and get hurt

The womans eyes bottomless unreadable The silence
excruciating
for poor Quoyle He clears his throat

QUOYLE
Um I write for the newspa
But she stands The grace and quickness of a jungle cat
WOMAN

Well Id better get to work I
see Providing structure and all

Brushes off her skirt He is in the dawning panic of beginning
to
realize

WAVEY

Im Wavey Prowse and this is

my place Pardon our antiquated
emphasis on individuality and the
freedom to have fun

Heads off with a loose-limbed stride Spins back around

Quoyle Bunny astride his back RAMPAGES around the parlor on
all fours SNORTING like a crazed boar The kids are squealing
delighted making excited little runs at him swatting him with
throw pillows and rolled-up sweaters Thrill of the hunt

Trustworthy eyes

professional

Mavis holds out a hearty hand Agnis is showing him the shop A
cutting table two sewing stations Billowing sailcloth hung over
the windows Racks of leathers and fabrics

AGNIS
And this is Dawn Budgel Shes a
vegetarian

Dawn once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side is
that Red lipstick and nails Her eyes float up in a way that
suggests reflexive sensuality Agnis nods to her and the girl
reaches a slender pale hand

DAWN
Agnis is always saying suchthings
about you Its nice to fit a man

With the name

And as she releases his hand her eyes flick to Agnis Some
conspiracy there Quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting
table

PULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right
beside her all along He holds the string of a big glum kite that
hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter As she watches
the kids he stares at her fixedly deciding whether to ask

QUOYLE (barely audible)

tender desire She looks at him the way he has always dreamed she
would He goes to

kneel beside her Touch her waist And now she is

another woman His hand is on Waveys waist and it comes
slowly away But her eyes are locked to his Making her choice

WAVEY (very soft)

Kneels His old fingers clear debris from painted words

W PRETTY 1897 - 1944 THROUGH THE GREAT STORMS OF LIFE HE

He hears the thread of feeling in his simple words And says no

He glances back up to the second floor thinking Bunny Looks at
the thing again Neat work Odd Slips it in his pocket

EXT CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Quoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush
vegetation The green house is far above him The shimmering bay
now just below This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous

and Quoyle SLIPS in the tangle and wet half-slides through wild
angelica stalks and patches of dogberry suddenly

LOSING his balance TUMBLING roughly down a stretch rolling
grasping a spruce trunk Pulling himself to his feet he hears
RUSTLING Looks up just as

a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes Red eyes Lips curled
back A frozen second of mutual indecision and Quoyle

SCREAMS and falls on his butt The dog

TAKES OFF bounding down a path we hadnt noticed Toward an
upright SILHOUETTE Who steps into sun just long enough to
become

a MAN grizzled and scrawny and quick Gone in a flash Like
a
skinny ghost And there on his butt

-Quoyle laughs softly How bout that Murmurs
QUOYLE
Attaway girl Youre smartern all

As he climbs to his feet he sees the rocky beach just below
Squints as if at something that doesnt belong We see it now

a SUITCASE washed up onto a tangle of rocks just offshore

ANGLEQuoyle wading into the water Up to his knees slips
sinks to his waist Stays upright Snatches the suitcase from its
perch Brings it back to shore holding it high Already he is
making the face of someone smelling something hed rather not

He sets it down The face is worse His curiosity running the
show he unhooks the latch

ANGLEbrightly lit kitchen Bunny sits at the little table a
large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her little Herry at
her side They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny TV Bunny
shovels in a mouthful of popcorn Then makes a sage if
unintelligible comment about the show to Herry Still chewing
she takes another huge handful of popcorn
Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird Bunny stuffs the snack
in Its a stare-and-chew side by side Just alike

ANGLEcozy parlor Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge
bowl of chips in his lap He is watching hockey on a modest TV
the action is fierce Stuffs his mouth full of chips yet somehow
manages to say

QUOYLE
so there they were this goofy
old codger and his dog big as life

PULL BACK to see Wavey now Curled on the sofa under a lap robe
She is knitting something in a heavy oxblood-colored wool He
watches her work

WAVEY (softly)
Thatd be old Nolan Hes actually
your uncle last of the crazy Quoyles
I should have realized

Keeps her eyes on her work

WAVEY
Sad really Lives like a hermit
in a run-down shack No one to
look after h

QUOYLE
Here I was worried about Bunny night
and day and theres absolutely
nothing wrong with her

A silence Which makes him uneasy
QUOYLE
Her only problem is her dad worries

WAVEY (not looking up)
You are a loving and wonderful father
Youre not the problem

She meant to reassure him Instead

QUOYLE
So what is th

WAVEY

Well Ive been workin longer hours
So Dennis and Beety were kind enough

friends

Quoyles smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence

WAVEY (very quiet)
I thought you forgot That Im your
friend too

No smile from her She wants him to know she was hurt He
shakes
his head serious now No I didnt forget

WAVEY
You want another sandwich Theres
roast pork

He holds up whats left of his four-decker This is plenty
Takes
a huge bite to show how much he likes it

WAVEY
You said Youd read me your
article
He did he nods But just now hes scared to And so she smiles
Which traps him He pulls out a single sheet of paper Clears his
throat
QUOYLE

Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil
Tanker Thats the header

She nods Likes that He gestures go back to your knitting
So
she smiles slyly And commences to knit

QUOYLE (reads)
Theres a 1904 photo hung in the
library Eight schooners heading
out to fishing grounds sails spread
it like white wings Beautiful Beyond
compare
This means something to him Hear it in his voice

QUOYLE (reads)
More common today is the low black
profile of oil tankers Like the
ruptured Golden Goose which last
week bled 14000 tons of crude onto
seabirds fish and boats at Cape
Despond

He stops As if revisiting that little thought in his mind

QUOYLE (reads)
There will be more and more tankers
They will grow old and corroded and
their tanks will split They have
already done to fishing What their
spill has done to fish

He sneaks a glance She has never looked up
QUOYLE (reads)

Nobody hangs a picture of an oil
tanker On their wall

Silence A full one
QUOYLE
Well Whatcha think
She reflects
WAVEY

I think when Card sees it hell
split a gut I think hell sit up
nights thinking of cheap shots to pay
you back I think hell never stop
until youre fired

Quoyle keeps nodding at each point Yep Yep

WAVEY
I think I havent been so proud Of
a friend Since I dont know when

Quoyles heart explodes in his chest And shines in his eyes
There is a long silence

WAVEY (softly)
Maybe another sandwich Theres
roast pork
He swallows He just doesnt want to cry from happiness

QUOYLE
Well sure

Quoyles mouth The box rests beside the cardboard carton into

QUOYLE (never looks up)
Jacks gone fishing

EXT OMALOOR BAY - DAY

The sky threatens black Quoyle picks his way across the rocks to
his ungainly much-maligned boat as it bobs against the weathered
dock He crouches and as he begins to untie it his gaze drifts
out toward the nearby point and

something catches his eye A boulder in the shape of a great
dog And as he stares there is something below it Something in
a cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing
rocks

it is a MAN in a yellow suit His head under the surface as if
looking for fish Arms and legs spread out like a starfish the
body slides in and out of a small cave Tugged by the sea like a
top on a string

Quoyle stares in frozen shock
QUOYLE (VO)
Headline Reporter Becomes Magnet

For Dead Men

No way in past the pounding surf the savage rocks So Quoyle
turns sharply Squints across the bay
QUOYLE (VO)
What was my panic He was already
dead Maybe I thought in some dim
way

CLIMBS into his boat TURNS the engine over KICKS it in overdrive
toward the town across the bay

QUOYLE (VO)
if it wasnt too late for him
It wouldnt be for Petal

STREAKING out toward the black sky Racing to open sea where the
chop INCREASES drastically Closer Closer

QUOYLE (VO)
Once I was past the shelter of the
lee shore and into the real wind
I realized my mistake

clear of the points protection the wind ROCKS the tiny craft
swells coming BROADSIDE The boat RISES then DROPS with cruel
speed Quoyle tries to swing the boat around the propeller RACES
the bow PITCHES violently SLAMMING down the stern SWAMPED the
hull filling swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea HITS with
all its force and the little boat

rcolls OVER Quoyle suddenly FLYING under water limbs flailing
in all directions

QUOYLE (VO)
Headline Reporter Becomes Anchor
Man

INTERCUTQuoyles dad FLINGING him into the public pool the
youngster SINKING like an anvil in a profusion of bubbles and
CUT

BACK to Quoyle struggling madly somehow to the surface THRASHING
toward the overturned boat GRASPING the stilled propeller shaft
which causes the bow to lift the next wave turning the boat
upright FILLING it with water and it SINKS forever as Quoyle

TUMBLES once more beneath the surface watching the boat
DISAPPEAR into darkness below him

QUOYLE (VO)
Stupid Stupid to drown with Bunny
so young No life jacket no floating
oar No sense

Back to the surface GASPING for air And then daintily rowing a
small boat unaffected by the waves her filmy dress rippling in
light breeze

PETAL
Look it floats Just like you

Is the lilting smile cruel Or only the irony that conveys
intimacy even affection

PETAL
Maybe its filled with fat

And VANISHES In her place bobs a red BOX A plastic beer
cooler He LUNGES for it GRIPPING the handles resting his chest
on its top

The waves RISE mountainous now and he rises and falls with them
He has been swept a mile from the nearest shore

INTERCUTa winch pulling part of the Geo streaming mud from
swiftly flowing water Police and bystanders gathered

QUOYLE (VO)
And I wondered Am I going where
shes gone

BACK to the bay A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to
the plastic cooler But hours have passed Light is fading

QUOYLE (VO)
and will I see her

He turns And there she is Beaming at him from the bow of her
little rowboat a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk It could be
love From behind her a light GLOWS giving Petal the aspect of an
angel

She drops a wink FADES away And the light becomes
the BEAM from a fishing boat Quoyle squints his swollen eyes
as strong hands WRENCH him from his box From the sea A voice
warbles distorted by wind and Quoyles diminished consciousness
JACK
Jesus Cockadoodle Christ I knowed
somebody was out here

Quoyles teeth are chattering so hard his body shivering so

painfully Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down ona
wriggling mound of fish
JACK
Thank god fer yer figure me old son
A thin man woulda froze

Quoyle burrows into the fish like nestling in a down comforter
Jack covers him with a heavy tarp Crouches down close

JACK
Good Yer lost thboat
INT BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
Dim light Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet His

eyes flutter Open Where

VOICE (0S very soft)
Its all right Youre in heaven

His head SNAPS around Shes sitting just beside the bed in half-
shadow Her oxblood knitting across her lap

WAVEY
Actually Its just my bed
Now he sees the cigarette
WAVEY

Actually its not I just wanted
to see your eyes bug out like that

Now he sees the smile

QUOYLE
You dont smoke

His voice was a croak So he CLEARS his throat with a massive and
disgusting effort It is gross and funny and she smiles again

WAVEY
Only when Im worried I dont
worry much

He rolls over to see her better They are very close
QUOYLE
You dont have to Im all right

Im in heaven

WAVEY
Im not worried About you

Oh As he draws a breath to ask
WAVEY

Youre in the boys room at Jacks
house Wonder how long since Dennis
slept here

She glances to the nightstand Beneath the dim lamp A picture
of
Jack and blond son Jesson Guess what theyre doing

WAVEY
Mrs Buggit called knew Bunny was
still with me The kids are camped
out in the parlor

A beat
QUOYLE
Nice You sittin up with me

WAVEY

He nods He will

QUOYLE
Who you worried ab

WAVEY
You didnt find a second dead man
Just the rest of the first one

Ah He nods Well that figures
QUOYLE
I asked Who you worried about
On this she stubs out her cigarette Takes another from the
pack
WAVEY

You said Bunny talks to Petal at
night You ever listen

He shakes his head

QUOYLE
Not really Wouldnt be right
WAVEY
Well Im not that nice a person

STRIKES a match

WAVEY
She plays Petal Talks to the
Barbies like Petal talking to her

Brings her cigarette To the flame

WAVEY
She says shes sorry she left them
It was just to see if they could be
good girls And they were

And
WAVEY
and she loves them
His eyes at once rapt and suffering She watches that

WAVEY
The Barbies look better naked Bunny
looks good in blue guess who said
that

Draws on her smoke

WAVEY

So we talked Just before Petal

left her with thatstranger Bunny
had snapped her moms bead necklace
Thats why shes making more

Do you understand

WAVEY
When shes made enough Shell
be forgiven

Tears are pooling in his eyes Hers too She keeps going

WAVEY
She saves Petal a room at the house
but shes also got the key to the old
place In case her mom would rather
go there

A thin stream of air escapes from his lips
QUOYLE
And she talked about it Just like
that

WAVEY
Sure I lied I said nice things
about her mother

Bitter smile

WAVEY
See theres only one problem
Petal isnt gone

Quoyle thinking Madly What can he do

QUOYLE
So were patient And we wait and
were good to her

(beat)
And Maybe Time

She stares back Unease to match his own Maybe time
INT ALVIN YARKS BOAT HOUSE - DAY

A wiry wisp of an aged elf ALVIN YARK is shaping the center beam
of what will become a tidy boat Its wooden skeleton across two
sawhorses in his spacious workshop

ALVIN (sings softly to himself)
Oh the Gandy Goose it aint no use
It aint no use the Gandy Goose

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE

The PRINCIPAL is spare dressed for England her voice
authoritarian by its pace exaggerated diction and lack of volume

PRINCIPAL
-not only pushed Mrs Lumball Not

only pushed her very hard
Seated in a semi-circle around the desk of power Quoyle
stricken respectful Wavey already pissed off at the principal

And Bunnyher hat and coat on arms folded face crimson and set

PRINCIPAL
She knocked Her down

Do you understand the severity of this Mr Quoyle
PRINCIPAL
And Refuses to explain her act Or
Apologize

Is that right young lady

PRINCIPAL
Under the circumstances We have no
choice but to suspend

Bunny looks down Glaring an evil spell of death at her own
kneecaps

WAVEY (quietly)
I think Bunny and I Should take
a walk
And stands
QUOYLE
Uh Wavey If its all the same

to you

EXT PATH - DAY

Quoyle and Bunny alone hand-in-hand walking slow where they once
picked berries Nobodys talking

BUNNY
When you gonna ask

QUOYLE (calm)
When youre in the mood

Apparently that hasnt happened yet More walking
QUOYLE
She musta done something Really bad
Said like he means it Which he does And Bunny squinting up

sees that

INTERCUTthe crime Playground filled with kids Bunny and
girlfriends on the jungle gym Bunny the best a natural jock

MRS LUMBULL large sour doughy and betrayed by life stands with
her silver whistle in the midst of chaos Her thoughts on a higher

plane

BUNNY (0S)
Shes the worst one of all

Little Herry Prowse comes to tug at the teachers wool coat He is
holding his crotch and jumping up and down This does not require
an advanced credential to interpret

BUNNY (0S)
Herry told her he had to pee But
the way he talks He could just
say eeee like that

Mrs Lumbull looks down From her face as she responds she has
already devoted over time more professional attention to this
troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator

BUNNY (0S)
She told him that recess was almost
over an she wasnt gonna make a trip
special an he could hold it

Herry seemingly disagrees Still holding his crotch he jumps up
and down with greater agitation She grabs him rather roughly by
the arm Marches him over to

BUNNY (0S)
She made him stand against the wall

and walks off pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away He
screams pumping his fists in frustration Grabs himself
suddenly Whether or not we can see the dampness spread we can
see his humiliation all too clearly As his tears come

a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs Lumbull Hunched
over like a linebacker full speed ahead LAUNCHING herself into
the back of the large womans knees Her feet go UP and the rest
of her goes

DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks Herrys tears stop
fast Watching the woman shriek and keep shrieking Makes him
laugh CUT

BACK TOthe berry path They are sitting on a fallen log

QUOYLE
See a good dad would say hitting
is always wrong You coulda hurt
her bad I guess you know that

BUNNY
She wasnt hurt for real Just

screamed like a baby

Quoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar

QUOYLE
Wish Id seen it It really sounds
funny

BUNNY

Petalll think so too

He looks at her Nods probably will Peels the candy bar free
of

its wrapper

QUOYLE
Well there wont be any trouble at
school III take care of that
BUNNY
How

He breaks the candy bar in half Tho not quite equally

QUOYLE
Because the best thing about people
Is they can forgive each other I
heard that this morning

BUNNY
That teacher Is gonna forgive me

He nods Oh yeh
QUOYLE
That And she wont want the story
printed in the paper

Oh

BUNNY
Well I dont wanna forgive her

QUOYLE
Me neither

He holds out the two pieces of candy She takes them both

bigger one in his mouth As he chews
BUNNY
I had to do it Cept for Wavey

She nibbles at her own piece

BUNNY
Like the ghost Whos not a ghost
Hmmn
BUNNY
The one who ties the knots Youre
the only family hes got
Right Her father doesnt react Hes even stopped chewing

BUNNY
You said

EXT NOLANS SHED - DAY

Quoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed hidden at the
foot of his cliff He carries a big carton which we see has made
the journey slow and awkward Across the gravel now to

the door HEAR the fire crackling see the smoke curling
Takes a breath Knocks softly Then LOUDER

QUOYLE
UNCLE NOLAN CAN I COME IN

No answer Juggle the box lift the latch Enter

INT NOLANS SHED - NIGHT

The old man and the dog huddled together at the fire They look
over with red eyes Just alike Only one growls Quoyle finds a
smile a soft voice

QUOYLE
Uncle My daughter Bunny and I
We got you some hot bread And some
meat Some dried fish Some squash
and vegetablesa cakesome warm
clothes

Nolan is listening Sharp-eared sharp-eyed What trick is this
So Quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor Takes out a loaf of
fresh bread One step forward Lay it down

Good faith offering And

-Nolan scuttles to it Like a wary crab He tears off a chunk
of bread Nibbles He likes it And as he eats

QUOYLE (softly)
You tied those knots huh

crouches down to the old mans size Almost close enough to
touch
NOLAN

INTERCUTa tiny frozen pond Long ago A girl of 12 rawboned
husky skating alone Weve seen her in the photo at Quoyles
dads house And as she skates she looks up to see

a boy of 15 stocky sullen He was in the same photo Only
now he steps onto the ice Unbuttons his pants Begins to slide
toward her on the soles of his fishing boots She looks around
Snow banked on all sides of the pond Nowhere to run on her
skates

NOLAN (0S)
Her brother me son She only

The girl breathless skating this way and that The boy closing
in cutting off her angle A deadly endgame There are no words
And

INT AGNIS NEW SHOP KILLICK-CLAW - DAY

Agnis and Mavis are showing Wavey their new shop It is big and
bright with more elaborate fittings the amount of work piled up
carries the scent of success Quoyle trails behind as Agnis dotes
on Wavey like a prize new daughter-in-law When she turns she
sees her nephew staring

AGNIS
What My hem crooked As if
I was wearin a hem

He was staring pretty intently Realizes that

QUOYLE
Naw I just come from seein your

She holds his gaze with her own Is she wondering

DAWN
Mr Quoyle What do you think of

Everybody turns on that one Mavis cuts her alter ego Agnis a
look Can you believe this slut

DAWN
I wore it just for you

She actually looks pretty good in it Wavey noticing that
Watching Quoyle say

QUOYLE
That was more consideration Than
I deserve

Polite banter Or outright flirting Hard to tell if its Wavey
or Agnis who disapproves more Dawn ignores them

DAWN
Did your aunt tell you about all

the money
Agnis just blinks Can scarcely believe she heard that

DAWN
Agnis told us it came from Macau

AGNIS (quietly)
Hush yoursel

DAWN

Uh Why would she send you more

Mavis echoes Agnis glare

INT WAVEYS KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE on Wavey cooking flapjacks Talking to them
WAVEY
Only you Could do this

And shes not pleased

WAVEY
You fed him You gave him clothes
Youre the first human ever was kind
to him

She scoops them expertly into a stack

WAVEY
Accordingly Youre sick with guilt

Serves them to

WAVEY
You sure youre not a complex guy

Quoyle who nods absently About the one thing he is sure of
Just now hes examining the prodigious status of her oxblood
knitting Still attached to the needles it looks too broad for
a muffler

QUOYLE (decides)
Horse blanket

WAVEY (ah)
Thats what that is

A beat Another

QUOYLE
So if ycalled around Musta
found somepla

WAVEY (quietly)
One decent golden age home Its
in St Johns You can maybe afford
it tho God knows why you should
She pushes the flapjacks closer to him CLANKS down the fork eat
Shes exasperated Thinks hes wasting his money

QUOYLE
I cant put him there til I go
down to St Johns See its all

right
WAVEY
Great Lets not be rash
QUOYLE
Come with me
And everything Sorta Stops
QUOYLE

I mean the kids could stay with
Dennis and Beety Or Agnis or
A meaningful beat

WAVEY
Why Would I Do that

She looks deep in his eyes Hard to guess the answer she wants to
hear He clears his throat Looks down

QUOYLE
Well Remember when you said
Someday Id do something nice
for you

And when he looks to her she is

PETAL (Waveys voice)
And this is it

A witheringly sexy smile
QUOYLE
Hey Overnight trip to St Johns
All expenses paid

Petal arches a delicate brow

PETAL (Waveys voice)
Overnight

He blinks And sees
WAVEY
Whats wrong with a weekend

With a playful smile Of her own
EXT DOUBLE-DECKER BUS ST JOHNS - DAY

Not London but it might as well be Wavey and Quoyle atop a red
double-decker bus wind whipping their hair She is watching the
big city flow past drinking every inch of it Hes watching her

INT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Wavey carries an armload of little girls tights and corduroy
pants picking through a bin of barrettes Quoyle appears with a
fistful of neckties Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a
time each more breathtakingly godawful than the last Well She
SHIVERS with disgust Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser-
vative one shes already picked for him He SHIVERS just as she
did They share the trace of a grin just alike He walks off

Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror as Quoyle
keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful She
pouts and poses like a runway model basically frowning that the

hats arent working Hes staring at her as if nothing else exists
in the universe She knows it

Wavey alone at a cash register The checker is ringing up a
selection of lacy bras and panties Suddenly Wavey looks up to
see Quoyle at the register one aisle over staring fixedly at her
purchases Seeing shes noticed him he holds up a huge pair of
loud boxer shorts hes buying and WAVES them at her She laughs
and waves her bras right back Civilians watching think theyre
in love

EXTINT ST JOHNS - DAYNIGHT

-Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolans future retirement
home It is twilight and the modest place looks pleasant and
welcoming Quoyle listens earnestly as the director points things
out Wavey watching Quoyle her gaze not so disapproving after

all

CLOSE on Quoyle with a bowling ball poised glaring our way
Here he comes Stumbles Lets go REVERSE ANGLE to see the ball
rolling rolling real slow Quoyle turns his back strides away
with confidence like he doesnt even have to watch this is too
easy Wavey points look He turns in time to see two pins fall
Pumps his fist YESSSS

INT BAR - NIGHT
Its late Its dim Its as romantic as urban Newfoundland will
ever get Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a
passably stylish bar Piano playing show tunes but soft He
pulls from his pocket

»a travel brochure Slightly drunk completely merry almost
wicked smile

QUOYLE
Now listen to this for tmorrow
After I sign the papers at the home

Shes already grinning Feels so comfortable

QUOYLE (reads)
The answer to your annual outing
Rainbow trout fishing in four ponds
You pay for what you catch Prizes
in the ponds If it drizzles or gets
chilly heated and lighted building
available right next to the ponds
with soft drinks candy bars ice
cream and chips

His subtle smile A guy could get used to this irony stuff

WAVEY
Or we could sleep in

innocent natural At some primal level his panic begins

WAVEY
I just feel so guilty about all
your expenses Two separate rooms
Both so big

QUOYLE
Hey its my treat You agreed
She nods She did
WAVEY

Still Seems like we could figure
out Something

Even Quoyle Has the message He looks down at his beer as he
thinks about what he should say Turns the glass in his fingers

QUOYLE
A friend told me once Love is
the only thing that counts
He nods Almost to himself

QUOYLE (a murmur)
Its the engine of life

He looks up Her eyes are waiting

QUOYLE
So when you told me how you think
about your husband I really
understood becau

WAVEY
Thats what I wanted us to talk
abou
QUOYLE
because real love Just comes
once
And everything Stops
QUOYLE

See you know some of the stories
about Petal Some of the bad things
What you dont know

But shes looking in his eyes And so she does

WAVEY (just above a whisper)
is how much you love her

Thats what it is

WAVEY
Even tho She never loved you
A beat
QUOYLE
Sorta Because of it

He sighs The most miserable and the most honest he has ever been
All at once

QUOYLE
See love Isnt about whats good
for you Isnt about what you wish
it was Isnt about whatwould
make you happy
His eyes are swimming Can she possibly hear this

QUOYLE
Love Is about want What you
really want And you cant change
that Even if its poison

Silence The piano plays something gay and stupid
QUOYLE

So thats why its great To have a
real friend When youre Lonely

The last word was a tough one It makes her nod She stares in
his eyes for the longest time And when she speaks he can
scarely

WAVEY

before
his eyes

WAVEY

WAVEY

Her voice chokes a little on that She shakes her head half-
grinning at how foolish she feels She smiles at him now Like
she means it

And leaves Without another word

QUOYLE (VO)
She did stay my friend In her way
Even tho for awhile we didnt see
each other a lot

He wants to cry He wants to be sick He doesnt know what he
wants Fumbles in his pocket for some wadded-up bills

QUOYLE (VO)

change everything

din of

And smiles

NUTBEEM (softly)

QUOYLE (a murmur)

So much feeling behind his eyes Nutbeem can only say
NUTBEEM
Well With that warning
And return the feeling With his own

EXTINT NUTBEEMS TRAILER - TWILIGHT

Quoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum
pulled from the back of his wagon Plenty more to go Staggers

into

Nutbeems
under stacks
and red-eyed
Quoyle peers

tiny threadbare trailer Every conceivable surface

of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts cheese
olives Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice
into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom

QUOYLE
Whats the barrel for
SEE it now Half a sawed-off empty BARREL with MOLASSES stenciled

in orange fills the shower stall

NUTBEEM
Im British I bathe

Quoyle sends him a blank look

QUOYLE
Perfect for th chips

He gestures to thirty bags of potato chips filling the
kitchenette

NUTBEEM
Its coated with two kinds of scum
Soap And mine

QUOYLE
Works We forgot to buy dip

INT TRAILER - NIGHT

VIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving We are
immersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentlemans Newfie
soiree music pushed beyond the level of distortion assorted
grunts squeals unintelligible words things breaking As we
struggle to look around

every square inch is crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks
Tert Card and some boys circle the potato chip barrel which has
become a handy urinal Near the door Dennis holding forth arm
tight around Quoyle who listens listens chuckles Then Quoyle

fights his way

OUT of the trailer to cold night air where the party is MUCH
wilder given the elbow room Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o
Billy Pretty who is singing to himself Finds Jack Buggit with a
beer in one hand a rum in the other Wraps a drunken arm around
Jacks neck Starts to talk in his ear Jack looks suspicious A
FIGHT breaks out a few feet away They dont notice Closing in
to hear

QUOYLE (shouting against the din)
SO THE NEXT DAY THEY ALL SIT DOWN
ON THE GIRDER THE BRIT OPENS HIS
LUNCH BOX OH NO SCOTCH SALMON
AGAIN FAREWELL BOYS AND HE
JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH
Jack nods Grins Thats pretty funny

QUOYLE
THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX
MON DIEU MEAT PIE AGAIN AU
REVOIR CRUEL WORLD AND HE JUMPS

This Is even funnier

QUOYLE
NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON
THE GIRDER HE OPENS HIS BOX
‘HOLY MOLEY BOLOGNA SANDWICH
AGAIN I DONT HAVE TO TAKE THIS
AND LEAPS OFF

Funniest yet Jack is chuckling already

QUOYLE
AT THE FUNERAL THE BRIT S WIFE
SAYS WHY DIDNT HE TELL ME HE HATED
SALMON FRENCHYS WIFE SAYS WHY
DIDNT HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT
PIE STATIES WIFE SAYS I DONT
GET IT HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH

Quoyle is chortling But Jack stares him dead in the eyes

JACK
YOURE SURE THE FELLER WAS A STATIE

QUOYLE
OH YAR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

At which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants

JACK
MADE HIS OWN LUNCH

POUNDING on poor Quoyle who is also dissolved in hysterics
Nearby the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no small
distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE

Even in this crowd it commands a certain degree of attention

BIG UGLY GUY
NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN NUTBEEM
YAR

Cries of YAR fill the woods Nutbeem himself is HOISTED on
shoulders whooping and sloshing his grog
BIG UGLY GUY
SO LESS KEEP IM ERE BYES AXE
IS FOOKIN BOAT GOT YER CHAIN
SAW NEDDIE

An idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL Soused Nutbeems eyes
open bug-wide as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the
docks Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective

And rather suddenly Quoyle is left alone
Among the conscious that is
INT WAVEYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Knitted wool the color of oxblood lies across a timeworn leather
ottoman In front of it little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig of
his own design The music seeps from a venerable accordian played
earnestly by his serious mom nodding and tapping her foot to the
time of his steps

There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry His grin
splits his round face His eyes say that his heart is dancing

PULL SLOWLY BACKthrough the window past the porch across the
front yard To a figure By the fence He stands motionless
Except his foot is tapping very slightly to the time of the
music

We cant tell how much Quoyle sees But his eyes say that his
heart is drowning

EXT NUTBEEMS TRAILER - MORNING

As Quoyle shuffles up we see Nutbeems trailer has been turned
completely OVER onto its side Walls are crushed and splintered
Its a train wreck

Sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it Nutbeem
and Dennis swig beers

NUTBEEM (cheery)
Youre looking dishy Q

QUOYLE
Feeling that and more Whats the
situation

Nutbeem hands him a beer

NUTBEEM
One Youre moving in with Dennis no
matter how fond you are of his wife

Quoyle looks sadly at the trailer Realizing it was his place that
got trashed

NUTBEEM (laughs)
And the boat Omigod

BILLY
Im some disgusted With the human race

NUTBEEM
Ida never made it anyway Storms
would have blown me to bits You
boys saved my life Yes you did

The boys look at each other Humiliated by his generosity
NUTBEEM

Ive gathered my savings and am
flying to Brazil Where water is
swimming pool green And I grill
yellowtail steaks with lime and

garlic watercress and Tobasco

Touch of curry What

Quoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely

QUOYLE (light)
I collect friends who cook Just

cant keep em
Maybe too light not to be obvious Billy looks from Quoyle to the
trailer And back
BILLY

Its too bad
Which seems to cover everything
EXT JACK BUGGITS SKIFF - DAY

Quoyle alone with Jack in open water Pulling on a slicker
gloves picking up a knife Jack is pronging cod onto the deck

JACK
Hands might as well be movin while

The mirth dies in his hosts eyes Like a 60-watt bulb in a
brownout Quoyle swallows the rest

JACK

QUOYLE
His whole life would be changed
If he could come upon A fishing
license

Jacks eyes Flat and cold as the cod hes gutting

JACK

This is not Going well A dangerous silence
JACK
Even doughnuts yknow Can

push their luck
INT WAVEYS PARLOR - DUSK

The day care contingent more organized today Sort of Bunny
leading a spirited round of red-lightgreen-light as

Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents As he
shrugs off his coat he looks at the Christmas tree its winking
lights The decorations that seem to be everywhere many handmade
by these children He watches Bunny call out Red Light only to
have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway

Mixed emotions to be sure A feeling of family he can at least
visit yet will never be his own The sad edge catches up with
him so he strolls on into

the kitchen Wavey baking what else She smiles to see him
A friends smile

WAVEY (Southern belle)
Why Mistuh Quoyle You shouldnt

have
He smiles back Takes her in for a telling beat before
QUOYLE
Uh I didnt Most of these

are for Herry
Even better

QUOYLE
Theres two Are yours

They are on top Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging
fine-motor-control-challenged personal style Be sets them on the
counter

QUOYLE
You probly want to wait for

Christmas

Meaning please dont So she wipes her hands on her apron Lets
him see her eyes dance just a flicker

WAVEY
Oh Im much too excited

Delicately unwraps the first Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT finely
painted with an assortment of BERRIES She holds it in her hands
at once admiring and wistful Wondering if theres a message about
their moment together while berry-picking

QUOYLE
Its from a museum catalogue But
its not real Its a copy

WAVEY (still gazing at it)
It is my favorite teapot

A simple pronouncement She opens the second flat and narrow It
is a TURQUOISE BRACELET Actually kind of stunning She blinks
taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense

QUOYLE
Its nice for your eyes I thought
She doesnt sayanything Lets it dangle from her fingers catch
the light
QUOYLE

Its for everyday You dont have
to save it for special

She looks to him Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants
Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends

WAVEY
Oh Ill save this all right

Covers With only a slightly more than friendly smile
WAVEY
And Ill think of you When I

put lot on

He can only nod Hed like that She holds up one finger wait a
second And hurries off

So he waits Looking at her kitchen Feeling his feelings She
is back with two boxes Sets them down Nods go ahead

one is heavy and square He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND
CASE He looks at her smiles in his childlike way Opens the
case which reveals

two leather-bound VOLUMES One a dictionary
thesaurus He is obviously moved

QUOYLE (a murmur)
You must have me mistaken For
a writer

And when he looks up

WAVEY
I dont make mistakes About
that kind of thing

The other a

He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other
package Big and flat but not heavy at all He lifts the lid

and pulls out

a huge comfy SWEATER In oxblood wool He is completely

stunned to realize

WAVEY (so pleased)

Well you cant be surprised Youve

seen me knitting it for months

QUOYLE
It was so big I thought it was a
tea cozy for your car But if its
for me it has to be bigger huh

Put it on put it on So he slips it over his head
and then some This worries her She plucks at it

WAVEY
Well Youll grow into it

QUOYLE
You kiddin After the holidays
well have to stretch it

Big enough

Hes just beaming Hugs himself to show how warm it is The

silence is companionable Then

QUOYLE
Not used to a woman Giving me
presents
She raises a brow Can scarcely believe that
QUOYLE

One Christmas with Petal I gave her
eleven things And I wrapped them
And watched her open them up

She holds her friendly smile But her eyes have changed
Slightly

QUOYLE
She didnt have anything for me
Like every year But this one
time she said Wait a minute

Wait a minute

QUOYLE
She ran to the kitchen I heard
the fridge open She came back
With her hands hidden behind her
Then she held out

Even his voice Betrays the longing

QUOYLE
Two brown eggs She gave them
to me from her own hands They
were cold

He smiles self-conscious
QUOYLE

Must sound really stupid But
they meant a lot to me

Silence A soft
WAVEY
Well Its the thought that counts
He nods Hes glad she understands
QUOYLE

I broke em careful Made her an
omelette with em And I saved the
shells In a little box

She cant help but show her surprise at that
QUOYLE
Oh yeh Theyre on a shelf
behind my desk At the paper

He looks worried now Shouldnt have brought this up And seeing
this
WAVEY
I know how it is To hold onto
something good In the middle of
all the bad

He nods But feels truly awkward now So
QUOYLE

Well I gotta collect Bunny
Beetys gonna have supper waiting

Right She nods She understands this too
WAVEY
Thank you Thank you very much
Takes her teapot and her bracelet Holds them A gentle
barrier

Her hands now too full for a hug

QUOYLE
Well Merry Christmas
With a wonderful smile
WAVEY

Merry Christmas
With one of her own
INT SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Quoyle enters a packed auditorium festooned for Christs birthday
with every trimming imaginable Rough fishermen in black jackets
they wear once a year women in finery schoolkids at their well-
scrubbed best antsy with anticipation The BUZZ is audible
palpable No Broadway opening could hope for this level of
eagerness

As Quoyle comes down the aisle we see faces we know Boys from
Nutbeems party Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs Buggit Alvin
Yark and his bird-like wife The old-timer who sold Quoyle his
boat Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her must be saved
for Agnis All the kids from daycare Still Quoyle searching for
the face he doesnt find And finally

to the third row where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat
Beety gives him a peck on the cheek and he smiles settling in

nervous as hell just as

the school principal still dressed for England walks to the
mike at center stage Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian
she prides herself on being and they quiet pretty fast

PRINCIPAL
Your friends and neighbors and
most of all your children Have

worked hard to bring you the best
pageant ever

THUNDEROUS applause whistling stamping She is frustrated for a
moment Then waves cheerily against the din shouting

PRINCIPAL
LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN

And RUNS off-stage as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES

the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeems boat stands
in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk singing DANNY BOY in
the sweetest tenor one could dream of PAN an audience rapt
motionless Pavarotti never had more respect

-Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage Marty
dressed in Christmas reds and greens Bunny all in blue which
does look good on her Kids CALL OUT their names The place falls
quiet And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMN
in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize It is unexpected
and breathtakingly courageous Two dads in the third row have
tears flooding their eyes

DENNIS (gruff whisper)
Not bad my kid eh

QUOYLE (gruffer whisper)
Ill say Shes as good as mine

Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage wearing a brown
jersey tweed skirt yellow stockings and red slippers She has

an odd look on her face all serious and curious The laughter and
calls die away to silence Suddenly one of her feet SCRATCHES at
the stage her arms become WINGS and with a CROONING and CACKLING
she metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg The house
comes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause Quoyle glances back
at Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLES
in pure delight

Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage in a long black
smock carrying her accordion She turns to the wings nods and
out comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes A
beat of silence Mom calls out ONE TWO THREE rolls into a

savage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsed
through a window Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down in
perfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing rattling
performance that builds in intensity until the finish He runs

to the edge of the stage bows DEEP from the waist stands beaming
in their applause Then RACES offstage his mom following with
dignity and we go with her into the wings

Once there Wavey slips OUT of the smock revealing to the dimness
of the wings that she is wearing dancers tights over drop-dead
legs A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles
crystal diamonds and dozens more glittering baubles that send a
shimmer of prisms with her every breath Herry hands her a top

hat a cane and

she STALKS back onto the stage her lithe body strutting and
glinting A hush of stupefaction falls only to be washed away
by SHOUTS and WHISTLES the kind of which have not been heard
since Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes In
the bedlam

she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger FLIPS it up in a double
somersault catching it square on her head She leans on her cane

And when at last they quiet

WAVEY
We all know Billy Prettys ways
Never save fifty cents if you
can save a dollar

She winks They laugh Billy laughing loudest
WAVEY
Well last Febry Billy wants

tget his grandfather clock repaired
Calls old Leander Mesher Local
call No charge

Twirls the cane recklessly In the third row a goggle-eyed Quoyle
couldnt blink if he tried

WAVEY

Well says Leander the big cost is
pickup and delivery Got tcharge
fifty dollars each way Two strong
boys Gasoline Air in the tires

Thats right

WAVEY
Theres no cost for air in yer
tires says Bill Get wi thtimes
hes told Tis called inflation

WAGGLES her eyebrows Groucho-style They are busting their guts
laughing Connoisseurs of wit

WAVEY
Billy lives at the top of the hill
Leander at the bot tom doncha know
So Billy gets a rope HOISTS the
grandfather UP on his back And
muttering the words fifty bucks

She puts her toe out SLIPS wildly windmilling her arms
pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock

WAVEY
Mite slick Four feet thick a ice

Tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more

WAVEY
Meanwhile at the bottom Auntie
Fizzard 91 years young sets out
in her non-slip galoshes and her
cane with the rubber tip Didnt
yer dearie

Bows to the old gal in the front row who is scarlet-faced in
hysterics as all around her applaud Wavey becomes her inching
along casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world

WAVEY
Meanwhile at the top

She is Billy once more beneath his burden her long legs stutter-
stepping to one side then the other slipping skidding the
howling all around her threatening to shatter walls and

WAVEY
OVER he goes clock-side down
and PICKIN UP SPEED

Miming the wild ride as they ROAR
WAVEY
eight blocks NINE missing

everything like a miracle zeroing in on

She becomes Auntie Fizzard once more shuffling looking left
right and suddenly up WILD-EYED
WAVEY
CLIPS er inta the snow bank

Nods sadly Leaning on her cane When at last they quiet

WAVEY
Just two galoshes stickin outta
the snow She digs er way out
Brushes herself off Looks at
him sprawled like a turtle on his
back tied to his massive burden
She says

She says

WAVEY
YOU THERE BILLY PRETTY

Levels a dead-eyed killer gaze

WAVEY
WHY CANT YOU WEAR A WRISTWATCH
LIKE EVERBODY ELSE

The place comes DOWN like a house of cards Bedlam surrounds
Quoyle who sits still as a stone Too dazzled to breathe

EXT ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING

Lonely stretch of wooded road middle of nowhere Light snow just
starting to fall A truck pulls up beneath a tree Out climbs

Wavey Looking grim walking slow Crosses the road to a

weathered diner The woman who only smokes when shes worried
pulls out a pack of Camels Looks through the diners frosted
window

a lone customer sits nursing his coffee He is 40 lean very
attractive Dark hard eyes set into worries of their own Wavey
lights up Watches in silence until

the man looks up Their eyes meet through the glass Hold
And on his faint smile

She turns her back Starts up the road
ANGLEhe is walking beside her now Snow drifting lazy her
smoke curling up He watches her anger how cold and quiet and

closed Smiles at her profile

HEROLD
I shoulda come last night Seen
the show
She cant even believe he said that Never looking at him

WAVEY
Woulda been a thrill for the
Christians among em They
think youre dead

Keep walking His smile is gentle

HEROLD
Well then we got good news
for th

WAVEY
So does your son

A beat
HEROLD
Even better news for him
WAVEY (low)
You think so
Breaking the words off Hes watching her profile

HEROLD (very soft)
I cant undo the hurt Ive done
Unless you let me

Gauging the feeling behind the bitterness

HEROLD
Theres a million reasons to send
me away Good ones And only two
reasons not to

Is she even listening He lets the silence hang

HEROLD
I love you And you love me

She stops walking Flips her cigarette off into the snow
Turns

now

Looks into his face And sighs

EXT SHORELINE - DAY
Rear ANGLE of Agnis crouching in the lightly falling snow At the
edge of the sea The spot where she once sent her dog to rest
HEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks A bulky figure
comes into frame Crouches down beside her Close She stares at
the gray horizon

QUOYLE (softly)
Mavis Bangs Told me where
youd be

No answer But she hears him all right
QUOYLE
We get so little mention in the

wires Thought youd like to see

He hands the folded print-out to her

QUOYLE
Head in the suitcase The mysterys
solved
She looks briefly at his eyes Takes it Starts to read
QUOYLE

Silver Melville was captured in
Moored with a cruise steward The
boy was twenty a looker wearing
Armani clothes Driving a nice Lexus

Agnis keeps reading

QUOYLE
Says she did it all for love

She nods at that Folds the paper neatly as if conveying
respect
Hands it back

AGNIS
Shed call me time to time
Husband was a pig More women should
do what she done Her situation

He looks in her eyes And decides to say
QUOYLE
Some women Shoulda done it to

their brother

The look holds She sees the compassion in his eyes Knows
hes
so on her side She clears her throat

AGNIS (softly)
Cousin Nolan Hafta pay him
a visit

They share a look He glances at the sea Beautiful spot
QUOYLE

Mavis said you buried Warren here
Called it an anniversary

She stares deep and unblinking into his eyes She will tell
him
AGNIS
Of a loss But not the dog

A held moment

AGNIS
What makes us do that nephew
Give ourselves away to someone
So we cant eat or think or
breathe without em

QUOYLE (just above a whisper)
I dont know We just do

Silence And
AGNIS
Wonderful aint it
And now she smiles Something we have rarely seen
AGNIS
Irene Warren died The mornin
after a Christmas We get one
true love in life nephew She
was mine
Hes not surprised And that in turn does not really surprise
her

AGNIS
Dont mean we cant give love
again And get some back

QUOYLE
For some it does
AGNIS (straight back)
Not for me

Strong with that Sure

AGNIS
And if that ruffles some small
town feathers

His smile in return Very real

QUOYLE
Yknow what the feathers around
here need th most A good ruffling
I say

He sounds pretty sure himself Their look holds

QUOYLE
Yknow what I need th most

She doesnt

QUOYLE
A really big breakfast

She nods one last time Sounds like a plan
INT GAMMY BIRD - LATE NIGHT

Quoyle alone with his cut-and-paste making up the front page
layout Moonlight on fallen snow through the window Late enough
quiet enough to hear

the vehicle drive up the engine turn off The footfalls to the
door which swings open The last person hed expect to see
Especially with a bottle Of Cuervo Gold

They stare at each other Only he smiles
QUOYLE
Hey Congratulations
She shoots him a quizzical look We see the edge right off
even

if he doesnt
QUOYLE

Last night On the stage You
were
Shakes his head with innocent admiration She puts the bottle on
his desk

WAVEY
It was easy I just kept thinkin
How would Petal do it

He hears it now right enough The anger the Cuervo She stalks
on over to the coffee counter only a bit wobbly Plucks up two
styrofoam cups

WAVEY
Were friends right Friends
drink together

Back to his desk Shrugs her coat off onto the floor Pullover
and jeans she looks terrific Hikes her butt up onto the edge of
his desk

WAVEY
I asked a quest

QUOYLE (quiet)
Ill drink with you If youre
not done yet

Her soft throaty laugh He hasnt seen her this way Cant
decide
if its more scary or exciting

WAVEY
Not drunk enough yet to talk about
Petal Which we always seem to do

Opens the bottle About four fingers are gone

WAVEY
Lets talk about me Which we dont

Pours herself another two Thinks before she says

WAVEY
Growin up all I wanted from this
place was out Imagine Give up
all this

Pours two fingers for him Stretches her body to slide the cup
across the desk The Cuervo sloshes

WAVEY
I ran off to Toronto went to
school Wanted to be a social
worker For kids

Shes looking at her cup now Not at him
WAVEY
Came back one summer Fell for
Herold Prowse That Was that
Takes a swallow Closes her eyes
WAVEY

Did you know I was a liar

Opens her eyes Straight into his Did you
WAVEY
Herold liked other women But you

know how that is
Sure you do

WAVEY (whispers)
He didnt die Not that he didnt
deserve to

Quoyle blinks A perfect stunned ox gape

WAVEY
See Im a good liar

Drains her cup

WAVEY
He ran off to Seattle with some
bitch When his damaged son was
two months old And nobody knew

An ice-cold wink

WAVEY
Like I said Its four years ago
And its yesterday

Pours herself another Savors the memory

WAVEY
So I took his boat out I sunk it
And told my little story Grieving
widow

Shrugs a drunken careless shrug
WAVEY
I was leaving of course Why
humiliate myself on the wayout

Yes

WAVEY (softer)
But a funny thing happened On

my way out
Her eyes are deeper now And for a beat the anger slips away

WAVEY
All these funny odd little folks
They put their hearts around me
So I wouldnt be alone Having
lost the man I loved

Silence A real one

WAVEY
And since I knew to my shame that
is exactly what I had lost I let
go of the will to leave I did

I did
WAVEY
Decided to let my child grow up

Around folks better than his mom

Stares in his eyes

WAVEY
Youre quite the talker

QUOYLE (quiet)
I take pride in that

So she smiles But the bitterness is there in it
WAVEY
Well this morning The man I

loved Came back

And the world Ceases to spin One mans world at least
She
watches that Assesses it

WAVEY
Told me he knew I loved him still
Sips at her second

drink Slides the rest of it down

WAVEY
Okay Now Im drunk enough To
talk about Petal

Her eyes ask Are you

Shakes her head

Means those words as an opening blow Jacks or better

comes
the hole card

Pure contempt

Lifts the cap

And from his prison of shock and shame

She

WAVEY
Youre thinking were kindred
souls you and me In love with
our nightmares

Uh-uh

WAVEY
You dont love your Petal You
hate Her cheating Guts

WAVEY
You have to think its love
Because if its not youre dead
inside So you keep that flame a
flickering Cos its all youll
ever have

And honesty

WAVEY
You see Youre a good liar too

Screws it back on the bottle
WAVEY

Wheres the damn eggshells Thats
all I came to see

is OFF his desk like a panther

SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure

high
to smash it and

stops To see the panic In his eyes

Here

He points to a shelf

RAISES it
It brings tears Pooling in hers

And she sets the treasure down with the tenderness that decency
requires

WAVEY
Can you guess how I know about
Petal
He cannot
WAVEY
Because you and I Are kindred

souls After all
And that Is what she came to say

WAVEY
So I told my husband To fuck
himself And the ego he rode in on

She crosses the floor Scoops up her coat Walks just a
little
wobbly to the door Sighs

WAVEY
Thanks for the mirror

Nods Means that
WAVEY
If I dont see you Happy New Year
And leaves The door closes quietly Quoyle looks from it To

the eggshells
And back
INT DENNIS HOUSE - LATER

ANGLEDennis and his wife BEETY bundled together asleep as a
ferocious storm HOWLS around the house

ANGLEQuoyle awake on the sofa in Dennis parlor Clutching his
blankets around him Eyes jumping with every SHRIEK of the
marauding wind Mind racing with thoughts of Wavey And
eggshells

ANGLEBunny asleep with Dennis daughter MARTY The room seems
to vibrate under the violence of the weathers assault CLOSE on
Bunny now and
her eyes OPEN A strange intent in them A knowledge She
slips from Martys bed in her thin blue nightdress Through the
house in the dark as the wind SCREAMS its warning Into the par-
lor where her father sleeps as the wind suddenly INVADES and

SUCKS her straight UP the chimney and out INTO the heart of the
storm SAILING like a loosened kite out across the black water
Out and out as gray light rises to

-Quoyle Point where she is blown FLAT against a granite boulder
just in front of the Green House which SHIVERS and pleads against
the wind its steel cables STRAINING and suddenly from within the
house lights come ON

the WHITE DOG is in a window No longer snarling and menacing
but whining pitifully begging to be saved And on the second
floor

PETAL alone wild-eyed with terror She is dressed all in blue
and her daisy-chain necklace flies about her throat as she POUNDS
against the glass her eyes staring directly AT her daughter who
can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house

begins to come LOOSE the first cable SNAPPING and WHIPPING
about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power then the
NEXT and ANOTHER and with Petal still visible HOWLING in horror
windows BURSTING everywhere else like flash bulbs the house

Slides FREE along the rocks toward the cliff Bunny screeching
as it goes OVER the edge TUMBLES down toward the sea and Bunny
Sits BOLT UPRIGHT in bed a single GASP as her dad is THERE

holding her tight She is soaked with sweat But her eyes are not
wild They are filled with the knowing

BUNNY (a whisper)
Daddy The Green House is gone

He smooths her hair The wind bellows in rage Little Marty
somehow sleeps on undisturbed beside her

BUNNY (a whisper)
I didnt dream it Dont say I did

EXT QUOYLE POINT - DAY

They climb from the station wagon into cold clear sunlight
Stare in wonder at the naked rock The snapped spent cables
Only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the
cliff
Bunny RUNS toward the debris and through it To a tangle of
bushes near the cliff

He walks to a broken cable Crouches His eyes running over the
space Where his ancestors home once stood And then He
turns

QUOYLE (calls out)
What you got there

We see now Bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its
hiding place Too engrossed in counting its contents to respond

As he comes over

BUNNY (not looking up)
Petals things

She is counting her treasure trove of NECKLACES More than any
sound mind could imagine Yet in their infinite variety somehow
wonderful A testimonial to the power of love

BUNNY
I think theyre all here

She looks up Sees him staring so fixedly at them

BUNNY (alerted)
Whats wrong

QUOYLE
Theyre beautiful I never saw
em All together

Oh The kid doesnt smile She decides whether to ask him
BUNNY
Will she be proud to wear em
He looks in her eyes His heart breaks behind his smile
QUOYLE
Well Any woman would

EXT JACK BUGGITS SKIFF - MORNING

Steel gray morning The sea is more than a little rough as Jack
lays out his lobster traps Two other boats not too close by
appear and disappear in mist He is checking the lines knotting
hefty weights onto the traps to take them down

JACK (sings to himself)
Oh th Gandy Goose she aint no uuuuse
Cos all her nutsn bolts is

Stops Halfway to lowering the next trap over the side

JACK (mutters)
Sweet Jesus Im turnin inta
Alvin Cockadoodle Yark

As it nears the water line Jacks cat SKIPPER TOM suddenly LEAPS
down ONTO the trap Jack blinks

JACK
What is this Suicide attempt

Tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion but the
cat JUMPS BACK to the boat Jack STUMBLING out of his way STEPS in
the coiled line which WHIRRS as the trap goes

-DOWN the line STRANGLING Jacks leg and WHIPPING him flailing
OVER the side in one startling heartbeat Almost comic to watch

But then It is very quiet Air bubbles appear at the surface
In a few seconds

The water is unbroken The boat bobs silently in the swells
INT ALVIN YARKS BOAT HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyles newly-finished boat It is a

beauty to be sure and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly
running his hand across the smooth gunnel Alvin doesnt smile
Thats not his style

ALVIN

Quoyle glances over The old boys eyes are dancing

QUOYLE

EXT JACK BUGGITS HOUSE - NIGHT

The road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons
Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house Everbody
knows everbody

INT JACKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Every room is filled with folks who wear their best There is
eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter as we move
through the crowd As if some have taken hold of a wakes well-
meaning purpose Others stand dazed still wearing their pain and
confusion There are children here some hold a parents hand
some giggle with each other Snapshot of a community Struggling
to cope

Quoyle and Bunny enter holding hands looking around As they
cross the room

two figures step into their path Two women holding hands
their bodies close together Their feeling for each other open for
all to see One is Agnis And the other Isnt Mavis Bangs

DAWN
Happy New Year Mr Quoyle Im
sorry I missed you at the pageant

Slightly startled Quoyle cant help but smile despite the solemn
occasion At the proud look on his aunts face

DAWN
I was in the wings a course
Wasnt our girl somethin

Our girl a course is Agnis Who nearly blushes at the
compliment

DAWN
I say yhave tlove a woman Whos
in touch with her inner chicken

Well who could argue with that Dawn leans up kisses Quoyle on
the cheek And with surprising softness

AGNIS
Nephew You okay
BUNNY
Hes okay Hes not sleeping in
the box

Her great aunt looks at this child Bends to plant an unexpected
kiss on the top of Bunnys head The kid squirms tugs her dad
firmly off as he sends a parting wave

Into the parlor now Quieter here as the new arrivals thread past
Jack Buggit in his open coffin resting on black-draped sawhorses
Dennis and his mom stand by Jack a hand and a word for each And
moving into the line

QUOYLE
Remember what I told you

His words a murmur Hers are bolder

BUNNY
If hes not sleeping Why do they
call it a awake

He thinks As if it is a worthwhile question

QUOYLE
Were the ones have to be awake
To how much we love him

Nods to himself Yes

QUOYLE
And how we should be good to each
other While we have the chance

He looks down They are almost there

QUOYLE
You think

She is thinking Keeping the thoughts to herself At the coffin
now he lifts her up to see Jack lies motionless a wax figure of
himself Serene behind violet eyelids

BUNNY
He looks like hes sleeping

Dennis looks over His stolid grim face releases a smile for his
friend

QUOYLE
Thats cos hes peaceful No
worries anymore No troubles
He sets her down Clasps Mrs Buggits hand And from his
pocket

QUOYLE
I found this in Jacks drawer at
the paper I dont know if its
somethin special

An enameled wreath with the initial R backed by a long sharp pin
She tears up again just to see it

MRS BUGGIT
Oh its his lodge pin We were
lookin all over

She smiles bravely as she takes it Leans up to kiss his cheek

MRS BUGGIT (a whisper)
Dennis showed me what ywrote fer
th paper Did Jack proud

So they look at each other Dennis clears his throat looks away
And then Quoyle is leading Bunny off

QUOYLE
You hungry Theres sandwi

BUNNY
Petals peaceful too

Just a statement of fact To no one in particular Dad squeezes
her hand Manages

QUOYLE
You bet You can count on tha
But she lets go Scampers to a corner of the room To Herry

Prowse And his mom

So Quoyle starts toward her his heart in his throat And when
Wavey looks up She is glad to see him As he reaches her

She holds up her wrist Dangling from it her turquoise bracelet
She wore her best for Jack Quoyle stands very close One last
thing from his pocket

QUOYLE
New Years present
A small box Wrapped as careful as he could She looks to his
eyes really

QUOYLE
Oh yeh Its a Quoyle tradition

Well in that case She takes it into her slender fingers Undoes
the ribbon the paper Lifts the lid to see resting in tissue

eggshells Crushed almost to powder Her heart comes straight
to her eyes even before the whispered

QUOYLE
Thanks For the mirror

And across the room Mrs Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix
the Lodge pin to Jacks lapel Shaking as she is the hand
lurches the big pin goes PLUNGING and

a rattling COUGH Rolls across this room The world falls
silent Jacks wife grabs her sons arm and their eyes bug out
staring into the box

DENNIS
DADS COME BACK

And LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the
coffins wedge A sudden ROAR there are SCREAMS there is even
LAUGHTER and WHISTLING complete chaos And in the bedlam a tug
on Quoyles coat

BUNNY
See He woke up

EXT OMALOOR BAY - DAY

Sunlit day of crystal perfection The majesty of ice and towering
rock and shimmering water A scale so majestic any cynic would be
hard put to deny Gods hand And gliding into FRAME

a tiny skiff On its maiden run We CLOSE to see

painted on its side THE FOUR WOMEN One woman is rowing just
now doing all the work Her son sleeps in the bow And in the
middle of the little boat

father and daughter Are unpacking the picnic lunch There
is
a lot of food This could take awhile

BUNNY
Thats a funny thing to say For
the first thing he said

QUOYLE
What Im keepin mdamn lobster
license

Yeh That

QUOYLE
Maybe he just said it To make
your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard
You think

She keeps unpacking Her face quiet and serious Her thoughts
her
own

QUOYLE (very softly)
Its not fair is it That Jack
woke up And Petal didnt

And since hes said her thought aloud She tells him

BUNNY
Well The worlds not fair You
said

Shes not looking up But he knows shes listening

QUOYLE
Thats something the world is
always teaching us And sometimes
the learning comes later

That gets through Both adults can see it

QUOYLE (a murmur)
You taught me that

Eyes resolutely down she nods Remembers

QUOYLE
You know What we wait for
Its like the main stem of this
boat It gives us our shape

Her brow furrows Doesnt understand that
QUOYLE

See I know why you saved a place
for Petal All this time
On this She looks up Her dad is smiling from his eyes

QUOYLE
Cos Im the daddy And you learn
how to do By watching me

And

QUOYLE
You just watched Better than
I knew

Still holding Bunnys eyes He beckons to the woman rowing
Cmere a second So Wavey sets down her oars Slides over
And Quoyle whispers to his daughter

QUOYLE
Watch this

He leans his face To Waveys mouth A kiss so tender even a
child cant turn away The moment lingers And when it ends

WAVEY
Im thanking your daddy For all
my presents

BUNNY
There was only two

Wavey looks at this girl

WAVEY
More than two Everything I need
Except
Except She gathers all the courage it takes to say
WAVEY

Except a necklace

And waits We can feel her heart pounding in her throat Bunny
stares back with eyes no one could read And then

BUNNY
I got a box of em You could
pick one
A hush over this bay A woman stunned and grateful
BUNNY

Then youd have everything you need
Well that seems true So the woman nods Her eyes flutter
down
In the silence she unwraps a sandwich

WAVEY (a murmur)
You want the cheese

BUNNY
No

Okay then She hands that one to Quoyle And as she and Bunny
look for another we PULL

UP and AWAY an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay
The boat so far below us The people tiny specks They could be

anyone

Anyone at all

FADE TO BLACK ROLL END CREDITS
