Various sepia toned images of Matthew Brady-type Civil War
PHOTOGRAPHS The final image is that of a makeshift
graveyard A frayed Confederate flag blows in the wind

DISSOLVE TO
INT NORTHERN UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM AMPHITHEATER - DAY

The final image of the Civil War graveyard is now projected
on a classroom screen COLLEGE KIDS sit at their desks
glassy eyed and open mouthed PROFESSOR ACKERMAN walks
among them bearded bespectacled and bewitched by his
manic reverie

ACKERMAN
More American citizens 618002 to
be exact died in our own Civil War
than in both of the so-called
(makes quotes with his fingers)
World Wars combined

In the front row a sexy AFRICAN AMERICAN COED mimics
Ackermans hand gesture Beside her sits ANDERSON LEE the
ultimate golden boy charming muscular body sensitive
eyes Basically the model student were he not fixated
on
the girls uncovered thigh a predicament which brings this
shapely nymphet much amusement

ACKERMAN
Now when we consider how the North
ended the Civil War with General
Shermans vindictive march through
Georgia his Union troops raping
looting hell annihilating dozens
of small towns swept away in the
carnage

Inexplicably this information appears to turn on the Coed
which of course turns on Anderson And the Professor

ACKERMAN
well we can truly understand
the rage the betrayal the South
felt towards the North and to
some degrees still feels today

Ackerman now notices an empty fast food box on Andersons
desk

ACKERMAN

Speaking of carnage Is that a
CarnoBurger you got there Anderson

ANDERSON
Um yeah

ACKERMAN
Did you know the meat in that six
ounce patty most likely came from
as many as 1000 different cows

Two rows back sits CORY JONES the closest thing to an
intellectual in the Northern U fraternity Half asleep
Cory slumps at his desk unaware of the raging hard-on
poking through his Bilabongs

NELSON ELLIOT however does notice An uncompromising
unrelenting (and uncoordinated) court jester Nelson dumps
his Pepsi Blue on Corys crotch jolting him from his daze

CORY
Mommy

The entire class turns to stare at Cory But not Ackerman
Hes still on his roll

ACKERMAN
The need to produce the cheapest
product possible commands that the
fast food chains literally own the
(makes quotes with his fingers)
Smiley Meal from its very birth

Anderson makes the quote gesture to the teasing Coed who
once again giggles Winks

ACKERMAN
Thus your CarnoBurger is born a
cow and your ChickNugget a
beakless large breasted mute

NELSON

Sounds like your sister Corndog
CORY

Nelson Lick my rim

The bell RINGS Books are gathered Hi-fives exchanged
These kids are the fuck outta there

ACKERMAN
Fine Good Go But the next
time you all pig out be aware
You are what you eat
EXT NORTHERN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Our trio walks along the campus inhaling the fresh air
Nelson carries a boogie board

ANDERSON
Oh Northern-U venerated dwelling
place of those who got wait listed
at real colleges we bid thee adieu
for ten long days

NELSON
Of killer surf

CORY
And genetically altered ice cold
brew

NELSON
And fine ass

An obscenely CURVACEOUS COED walks by brushing the guys
aside with obvious distaste

NELSON
Ahem mighty fine ass

She gives Nelson the finger as she disappears

NELSON
That is pure sexual harassment

EXT FACULTY PARKING LOT - DAY

They arrive at the lot Top down Andersons convertible
muscle car sits at the end parked perpendicularly across
two spots Several parking tickets grace the windshield

ANDERSON
These tickets are three weeks old

CORY
Then theyre probably no good

Cory grabs the tickets and puts them on a late model Volvo
in the adjacent spot Nelson begins tearing off his clothes
ranting like the madman that he is

NELSON
Bond with the boys Stick it in
the puss Bond with the boys

Down to his Beach Fun swim trunks Nelson hops round the
lot Eternally immune Anderson and Cory focus on clearing
out the many beer bottles and junk food wrappers which
clutter the otherwise spotless convertible

CORY

You know dude as excited as I am
that now is now you know Spring
Break time to get savaged by some
slop-drunk Babes Gone Wild hotties
I’m also kinda realizing that the
deal of a major life experience like
this is the looking forward to as
opposed to the actual doing of

Anderson looks blankly at Cory

ANDERSON
Corndog have you been jacking off
with your mother’s hand créme again

CORY
(after a beat)
Maybe just a little

Professor Ackerman arrives arms full of books for the
spring break “read” He pauses by the Volvo (which is of
course his) and removes the tickets
ACKERMAN
Congratulations Mr Lee on being
assigned a spot in the faculty lot
Ackerman studies Andersons horrid parking job Amused
ACKERMAN
Is this what you call parking
(makes quotes with his fingers)
outside the box

ANDERSON
Hey I like that

Ackerman hands Anderson the clump of tickets

ACKERMAN
Too bad the Meter Maid didnt

Nelson hops over boogie board in tow
NELSON

Yo Professor Ackerman I was just

ACKERMAN
I take it this will not be a trip
devoted to what Joseph Campbell
refers to as the “Journey Within”

CORY
Oh we plan to journey within sir
Just not inside a book

The African American Coed from class enters the lot
Anderson poses and smiles as the Coed walks right past
him to Ackerman seductively adding her books to his pile

ACKERMAN
Now if youll excuse me boys
I have my own noble quest to take
care of See you next Wednesday

Ackerman loads the girl into his car The guys can only
stare in awe

ANDERSON
Its good to be the Professor

EXT NORTHERN UNIVERSITY FACULTY PARKING LOT - DAY
A beat later
The convertible backs out of the lot Anderson sits behind
the wheel Cory rides shotgun The half naked Nelson stands
on the back seat beach ball in hand guiding Anderson past

NELSON
Go banjo boy go

SCREECH A silver Mustang convertible top down skids into

each other its immediately clear there is some kind of
“wild thing” between the three

NELSON
Holy

The passenger door opens KAT a dark-haired tattooed
belt-and-buckled vixen kicks her way out and heads for the
mini-market

NELSON

both sugar and spice

Lester marches to and fro out on the street proudly piping
When Johnny Comes Marching Home on his wooden flute
Jezebel struts behind him dressed in Rebel military garb
complete with a tiny holster and pop gun Atop her head rests
a confederate hat worn at a jaunty angle

From the porch Anderson rises and salutes

ANDERSON
As you were private

Lester salutes back as he passes visibly moved

LESTER
Thank you sir

The girls giggle up a storm From behind the girls fans
GRANNY BOONE suddenly appears magically as if from thin
air Gray-haired and bespectacled full tray of beverages
in tow Granny is the archetypal Southern matron save for
the mangy coonskin cap perpetually perched atop her head

GRANNY BOONE
Anyone for fresh lemonade

The boys rise a bit startled yet forthcoming in manners
nonetheless

ANDERSON
Dont tell me You must be Miss Boone

NELSON
Miss Boone from the bottom of our
hearts we thank you for such fine
accommodations

KAT
My daddy proposed to my mom in the
back of a 69 Chevy

Harper remains absent in his thoughts Kat fiddles with his
belt undoing the buckle

HARPER
Of course that was before the
troubles Before all that fire
done burnt this spot to the ground

Kat reaches down into Harpers pants

KAT
Oh I can feel that fire now

HARPER
Life always finds a way to push
itself up through death Miss Kat

KAT
Feels like something else trying to
push its way through now baby

Kat strokes Harper down below He finally responds
flashing a killer smile placing his hands on her backside
She swoons as he slides down her shorts exposing a winged
unicorn tattooed on her butt
HARPER
Ya like horses

INT HORSE BARN - DUSK

The barn door busts open Harper enters with Kat pulling
her by the hand to a pile of hay on which they tumble
HORSES WHINNY and NAY as the two roll around and make out

KAT
Make me scream that rebel yell

HARPER
Now that I can guarantee In fact

A man inspired Harper gets up and starts tinkering around
the barn Kat makes herself comfortable in the hay

HARPER

KAT
Whatever you say lover man

Harper finally returns He bends down next to Kat and
begins gingerly tying a TWINE ROPE around her left hand

KAT
I didnt know my southern gentleman
had a touch of kink in him
Harper ties another rope around Kats right hand
HARPER

Well if kink means a hunger for you
maam than that he does

More rope goes around Kats left ankle

HARPER
Now I know you city folk think
us country boys naive in the ways
of love

And now the last bit of rope goes around her right ankle

HARPER
but we aint as innocent as you
might think

Harper stands to admire his handiwork Kat is completely
tied up her legs and arms spread-eagled For the first
time she realizes that the other ends of the ropes are
fastened to the saddles of four very restless HORSES The
animals move forward lifting Kat into the air as the ropes
are pulled taut

KAT
Uh Harper This isnt exactly
what I had in mind baby
HARPER
Frankly Miss Pussy I dont give

a damn

With that Harper pulls an antique pistol from his
waistband BAM Startled the horses gallop off in four
opposite directions taking with them Kats arms and legs
which are violently torn from their lengthened sockets

HARPER
Yee haw

Having been lifted in the air by the ropes Kats severed
torso now lands with a THUD shock forever etched on her
blood gushing mouth

purposefully for all the Townsfolk to hear

MALCOLM

Well all right then See yall at

Anderson embraces Joey trying to look casual Kinda tough
to do when the local undertaker COFFIN HARRY is loudly
hammering nails into pine boxes on his front porch

ANDERSON

address

JOEY

JOEY

Cory low-fives Anderson then walks off with Joey Anderson
lingers watching them go

EXT WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm sneaks around the back yard of a wooden cottage
Looking for a clue Looking for Leah

He passes TWO YOUNG BOYS who play in the yard hovering
over a strange contraption made of Lincoln Logs It looks
like a mini-ski slope down which they roll a mini-beer
barrel Inside the barrel a frightened MOUSE struggles to
keep its balance

EXT GRANNY BOONES HOTEL BACKYARD - DAY

Cory and Joey hide behind the weeping willow and scope out
the hotel They watch as Rufus loads their stuff in fact
all of the Guest of Honors belongings onto a wagon
They look at each other for the first time really afraid

EXT CAR BARN - DAY

Stalking about like a ninja Anderson approaches the barn
doors and gives them a tug Locked Looking around he
spots a pile of hay bails He climbs on top then pulls
himself up onto the barn roof The rubber soles of his
shoes do not make for good traction and its all he can do
to maintain his grip Thats a real shame because down
below Hester and Glendora are making their way around the
barn absorbed in song

EXT WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm slowly edges around the cottage walking right
into the fucking Strolling Minstrels who sit on the front
porch The musicians waste no time serenading with yet
another of their lame ditties

STROLLING MINSTREL A
There are lessons in this world
Some are easy some are hard

STROLLING MINSTREL B
To swallow that is

MALCOLM
Not this shit again

Malcolm brushes them off in disgust and walks down the dirt
road But the duo gets up Follows

EXT CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson hangs on to the roof for dear life as Hester and
Glendora chatterbox below

HESTER GLENDORA
Nothing is so sweet when youre
munching on the meat of a Yankee
whos doodle is so dandy

HESTER
You think Mayor Buckman would mind
much if we kept that Anderson boy
to ourselves

GLENDORA
Oh I dont know cousin Id rather
kill him than fuck him any day

Anderson loses his hold and slides down the roof He
catches himself just before falling to the ground Whew

GLENDORA
Shhh Ya hear somethin

The girls check out the barn walking directly beneath
Anderson He holds on to the edge of the roo the jagged
wood cutting into his flesh

HESTER
Probably just a rooster

EXT WOODEN COTTAGE - DAY

Malcolm walks down the lane trailed by the Strolling
Minstrels They sing as they stalk

STROLLING MINSTRELS
There was once a young lassie
Slant-eyed and kind of sassy

He walks faster They walk faster

STROLLING MINSTRELS
She had airs and conceit
Till Granny she did meet

Malcolm stops Turns to face the Hillbilly Duo

MALCOLM
Any of you shit-for-brains know
where my lady is you better tell
me now

STROLLING MINSTRELS
The boy wants his bitch
Yeah the boy wants his bitch
Sad sad thing a boy without his
bitch

And then they stop Smile Point Malcolm turns to see the
familiar leather clad-form of Leah up ahead on the path
Her long black hair blows in the breeze as she playfully
dodges into the thicket GIGGLING Malcolm grins Relieved

MALCOLM
Talk about a sight for sore eyes

He chases after her up the road

EXT CAR BARN - DAY

A stream of Andersons BLOOD slowly trickles down the roof as
Hester and Glendora chat below

GLENDORA
That reminds me of a joke Granny
told me Whats the difference
between a rooster and Ellie May

HESTER
Well Im sure I dont know cousin

The rivulet of red gets closer to the edge Anderson is
sweating quite profusely Of all the times for jokes

GLENDORA
A rooster says Cock a doodle do and
Ellie May says Any cock will do

Anderson winces A droplet of blood spills downward heading
directly for them

HESTER
Thats disgustin

Hester takes Glendora by the hand and pulls her away The
blood splatters on the ground barely missing them both

HESTER
Now enough of your chatterbox
Weve got a festivation to attend

WHEW Anderson breaths relief Renews his efforts to make
his way up the roof

EXT BATTLEGROUND - DAY

Leah runs out of a thicket into a wide open field In the
middle is a large wooden platform like a watchtower nearly
twenty feet tall A wooden sliding board leads down from the
top to a giant bulls-eye painted on the stone landing below

Leah GIGGLES tosses her hair Heads up the watchtower ladder

MALCOLM
Cmon baby No more clowning around

Malcolm follows hand over foot Leah reaches the top A
large beer barrel rests on a slab The barrel is open at
both ends She crawls inside

MALCOLM
Okay we both know Daddy likes
games But you had me worried
Where the hell you been anyway

More GIRLISH GIGGLES from the barrel Going along with the
game Malcolm walks over to the keg and peers inside

MALCOLM
Give me a wet one sugar muff

Malcolm closes his eyes puckers up Nothing What No kiss
He opens his eyes

coming face to face with the twisted grimace of Lester
his face smeared with lipstick and rouge Leahs bloody
scalp rests atop his head He wears her leather duds

MALCOLM
What the fuck

From inside the barrel Lester grabs Malcolms wrists and
yanks him through Rufus pops out a trapdoor from below
joining Lester as he wrestles with Malcolm

MALCOLM
Who the fuck are you people

Despite his kicks of protest Lester and Rufus manage to gag
Malcolm tying his hands behind his back They then position
him so that his head and feet extend from either end of the
keg From his new perspective Malcolm can now see that
Mayor Buckman and the entire townsfolk have gathered in the
field below They wave flags CHEERING What a hoot

MAYOR BUCKMAN
It aint so bad you big baby We
just gonna roll ya to the bottom
is all Then youre free to go
If you can

Lester hands Rufus a couple of hammers and a bucket of long
nails They begin hammering them into the barrel

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Oh I almost forgot to tell ya
We like to tickle ya a little on
the way down

Malcolms eyes bulge in rage This simply is not happening

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Roll out the barrel

Rufus gives the barrel a good kick and it rolls down the
slide Each revolution is pure agony for Malcolm as the
nails tear into his body ripping him apart Upon reaching
the edge the barrel flips into the air then crash lands
on the bulls-eye below

Mayor Buckman rushes over and kneels besides Malcolm who
lies impaled on the splintered wood His chest heaves his
final strangling breaths Buckman jerks off his gag

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Give us that death rattle boy
You can do it

Silence as Malcolm coughs chokes then spits a chunky
mouthful of his own gore directly onto Buckmans
confederate flag eye patch quickly erasing his smile

MALCOLM
Kiss my black ass

With that Malcolm expires The crowd CHEERS Atop the
tower the Buckman Boys share a joyful embrace as Lester
removes his wig

RUFUS
Damn Lester You sure is sexy

Below Buckman wipes his face with his handkerchief
Deeply perturbed

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Next time the gag stays on

INT GRANNY BOONES HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY

The door cracks ajar Cory and Joey peek through Seeing
the place is deserted the two enter

BONG A metal pail falls from above heading towards Joey
Cory quickly pulls her aside avoiding damage

JOEY

The two tiptoe over to an antique telephone on the wall
Cory stands guard while Joey dials

says everything to Cory He gets it

CORY

under the mattress Maybe they

INT CAR BARN - DAY

The silo window opens Anderson peeks through Down below
Malcolms motorcycle can be seen parked in one of the
stalls The only way down however is a twenty foot drop
Contemplating his options he leaps landing on the
haystack It cushions his fall but an inch to the right
and he would have been impaled on a rusty pitchfork

INT GRANNY BOONES HOTEL MAIN HALL -DAY

Cory walks through the empty hall then up the staircase
step by measured step careful not to make a sound

INT GRANNY BOONES HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY

Joey stands alone Nervous Pacing She begins to scan the
cupboards Pie pans rolling pin wooden bowls

INT CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson creeps through the barn footsteps crunching the
bone-dry hay Cautious he pauses The crunching continues
Could someone be watching Nah He forges forward

passing a stockpile covered by a soiled tarp Curious he
lifts the edge Gasps at the familiar objects heaped before
him His school books The beer cooler The boogie board
And Nelsons guitar Broken Bloodied Cursing he heads to
the stall housing Malcolms bike

INT GRANNY BOONES HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY

Joey continues to take inventory spotting a row of mason
jars on the pantry shelf She gasps Pickled eyeballs
Pickled fingers Pickled tongues All human And all
with a year scrawled on the label- Festival 1875
Festival 1964

Joey is about to scream when a hand thrusts out of the
darkness and covers her mouth The unseen ATTACKER lifts
her and skirts out the back door

INT CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson hops on Malcolms motorcycle handkerchief wrapped
round his bloodied hand Ready to roll Except No keys
Then a voice from the shadows

HUCKLEBILLY
Ding dang doodle I do believe you

boys bike

Hucklebilly stands guard at the door dangling Malcolms
keys like a carrot Anderson approaches the boy Slowly

ANDERSON
I wasnt stealing buddy Just

HUCKLEBILLY
Well truth be told I reckoned to

INT ANDERSONS HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door open Cory enters Gently closes the door behind
him He turns to see a FIGURE emerging from the shadows

CORY
Is that you Kat

PEACHES
Nope just little old Peaches

An ethereal vision Peaches appears to glide across the
floor as she slowly unties her tank top Scared shitless
Cory is genuinely torn between caution and erection

CORY
Ummmm Joeys downstairs Shes

Peaches locks the door all buckteeth and smiles

PEACHES
You Northern boys may be used to
uptight ladies like her

She eases Cory onto the bed then gets down on her knees

PEACHES

Cory is hesitant Peaches begins covering her mouth

CORY
You taking out your retainer baby

PEACHES
Nope Putting something in my momma

Cory gets all excited Peaches looks up and smiles----
She now wears a metal mouth piece with razor sharp edges

PEACHES
Momma calls this my Penis Fly Trap

Before Cory can protest Peaches puts her head between his
legs and chomps down HARD He opens his mouth to
scream but nothing comes out as a geyser of blood showers
him red with repeated spurts Holding tight to his crotch
Cory slides to the floor while Peaches licks her lips clean

INT CAR BARN - DAY

Anderson sits beside Hucklebilly WHISTLING along with the boy
as he SINGS an old rockabilly tune Pure torture for
Hucklebilly continues to dangle the keys The keys to freedom
Finally Anderson hops to his feet snaps his fingers

ANDERSON

Anderson jumps to the barn doors and opens them wide
Hester and Glendora stand there with guns blocking the way

HESTER
Ring the dinner bell

GLENDORA

He turns Hucklebilly stands there grinning like the Devil
aiming his slingshot

HUCKLEBILLY
You really dont think Im that

KAPOW Anderson takes a rock in the head He falls to the
dirt spilling blood losing consciousness as everything

FADES TO BLACK

EXT BARBECUE PITPICNIC AREA - NIGHT

The world comes into view as Anderson slowly regains
consciousness It is night now a full moon and to his
horror Anderson discovers he is strapped down to a large
picnic table gagged

Flaming torches light the area casting hellish shadows

The whole town is there Granny Harper Rufus
Lester (and Jezebel) Hester Glendora Peaches
The Milk Maiden Hucklebilly

They sit around the table in wild anticipation knives and
forks in hands Mayor Buckman proudly presides at the head
watching over a gagged Joey who is bound to her chair

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Just in time for the grand finale
It all comes down to this year
after year Dont it Granny

GRANNY BOONE
That it does Too bad their friends

HARPER
Well thats a matter of opinion

Buckmans smile dims as he stares into Andersons eyes

MAYOR BUCKMAN
You Northern folk always thinkin

Anderson holds Buckmans gaze refusing to look away The
moment passes

MAYOR BUCKMAN
So whos gonna say grace Hucklebilly

Hucklebilly rises from his seat eyes closed hands folded
all pious and reverent And then

HUCKLEBILLY
To our guests from the North
spread at our feet thanks for
being such tasty meat

74

The crowd APPLAUDS Bowls are passed glasses filled The
Strolling Minstrels break into a rousing rendition of The
South is Gonna Rise Again Its just like the 4th of July
Sort of

Buckman moves over to the buffet table Hester and Glendora
walk up each holding a silver platter The Milk Maiden and
Peaches approach with another Buckman smiles pleased

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Bet our guests will be mighty
impressed when they see what
Granny Boone cooked up

Like a master chef showing off he removes a lid to reveal
the lovingly prepared barbecued heads of Cory and Nelson
Their pried open mouths each hold a baked cinnamon apple

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Bet you cant eat just one

Buckman unveils the other platter containing Ricky and Kat
A pineapple ring dangles from the skewer still protruding
from Rickys gaping mouth Joey and Anderson fight back
vomit as the girls place the dishes on the picnic table

Rufus and Lester bring over two more platters

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Yall like dark meat

Buckman lifts another cover Its Malcolm chopped up amid
chitlins and blacked eye peas

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Now it might come as a surprise
but me Ive always been partial
to Chinese

Yep The fourth plate contains whats left of Leahs head
plus a couple of smashed body parts for garnishing Buckman
grabs some Asian fried fingertips pops em in his mouth

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Only problem is an hour later
Im still hungry

Everyone CHEERS and begins dancing around the table

clapping their hands stomping their feet Harper and
Hucklebilly ride Malcolms motorcycle circling the table
The hellish flames from the barbecue pit seem to move to
the music as the Minstrels play faster and faster

Joey shuts her eyes against the madness nearly hysterical
from this insane surrealistic nightmare

Finally Harper hops off the bike and leaps onto the picnic
table brandishing one of his spiked gapping’ shoes
Anderson braces as he edges closer

HARPER
We was gonna go easy on you boy
Being as you was a fellow reb
Once at least

The razor sharp points are inches away from Andersons
straining neck

HARPER
But then little missy over here
done went and turned you

Buckman leans in Wipes Andersons brow with his silk

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Being a Southern gentleman I just
might give you a second chance All
you gotta do is gut the bitch

Buckman points to Joey Her eyes widen in fear as Granny
holds out her rusty meat cleaver

GRANNY BOONE
Why its just like gutting a
possum honey
Anderson studies Joey the cleaver the spikes at his neck
Contemplating his options he closes his eyes and nods-
affirmatively Buckman grins and cuts his bindings
MAYOR BUCKMAN
Welcome back son to the glory and
honor
Anderson rises takes the cleaver and walks over to Joey
Tears flowing she braces as he slowly lifts the blade
above her trembling head

ANDERSON
Glory and honor

Anderson swings the blade down
WHOMP

cutting the ropes that bind Joey

ANDERSON
You fucking maniacs wouldnt know
glory and honor if it bit you flat
on your Southern ass

Anderson wings the blade at Buckman but Rufus knocks him
down taking the cleaver straight in the chest

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Stop that Yankee traitor

Hester and Glendora rush Anderson from behind receiving a
mouth full of elbow as he coldcocks them both The two topple
knocking over a cast iron pot loaded with cooking oil

WHOOSH The fire pit ignites A wall of flame spreads
separating Anderson and Joey from the townsfolk

ANDERSON
(removing her gag)
You okay

JOEY
Ill kill those fucking bumpkins if
they even try and touch me again

ANDERSON
I guess that means yes

Anderson looks around Points Just yards away Malcolms
motorcycle lies on its side Escape

They head over Peaches leaps over the flames taking Joey
down all set to vampire her ass with her metal mouth gear

Anderson moves in to assist but Harper jumps in his way
His wields a spiked horseshoe swinging at Anderson with
wild sweeps slashing cutting

On the other side of the flames Lester helps Buckman to
his feet as Rufus extracts the cleaver like it was nothing

RUFUS
Please dont beat me Daddy

Buckman grimaces brushes his sons aside then stands atop
a table to observe the scrapple The crowd follows suit
more interested in watching the ladies bout than ducking
the encroaching flames

MAYOR BUCKMAN
That city girls got more ballsack
then you two flapjacks combined

Joey has become a wild animal beating mercilessly on
Peaches Hucklebilly watches from the crowd intrigued Is
that a tit he sees Wanting to feel useful he aims his
slingshot at Joey and opens fire BAM hitting Granny
Boone square in the chest She hits the dirt The crowd
CHEERS morons that they are

Meanwhile

Harper swings at Anderson Slices his chest his stomach
Anderson ducks rolls to the ground kicks Harper in the knee
Harper drops the spiked horseshoe which Anderson retrieves

Back to the catfight

Joey is about to deliver the final blow to Peaches when the
Milk Maiden jumps in with her infamous jug She hurls it
Joey flips out of the way The container whacks Peaches in
the cranium cracking open and bathing her with acid

Back to the cockfight

Harper charges Anderson who lies on the ground Anderson
swings forth with the spiked shoe impaling Harper in the
jugular Blood spurts forth from the wound

WHOOSH Buckman empties a bucket of water onto the flames
quenching the fire All eyes turn

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Yall stand back Theyre mine now

He moves forward removing a long gleaming sword Hushed
reverence grips the crowd as their Mayor licks his lips

MAYOR BUCKMAN
Shock and awe folks Shock and awe

Buckman lunges at Joey and Anderson swinging his blade
wide and madly Joey rolls to the ground banging her head
She lies there stunned as Anderson hops on the table
Buckman slashes cutting the tables front legs in half

The table and Anderson come crashing down as do the
silver platters and severed heads which spill all over him

Defiant Buckman lifts his sword and readies for the
killing blow But as he brings the blade down Anderson
grabs the nearest food scrap to block

THUNK The blade connects cutting into the back of
Corys severed head Face to face with his old friend
Anderson freaks tossing it and the blade aside

Filled with renewed vigor Anderson jumps up and violently
hammers Buckman again and again with a cut to the left and
a cut to the right

POW POW

Shaking it off Joey moves to Andersons side and joins
in the drubbing

BAM BAM

The two pummel Buckman relentless in their rage Joey
kicks him to his knees Anderson wallops him in the face

-knocking off Buckmans confederate flag eye patch

unmasking a web of flesh which bisects a gaping cavity
Buckman roars possessed pathetically searching the ground
for his fallen eye covering

Anderson grabs Joey

ANDERSON
You with me

JOEY
All the way

The two rush to the motorcycle hop on Anderson guns the
engine and they take off circling the field looking for
an out But everywhere they turn they are surrounded by
maniacs Leering Venomous Fucking frightening as hell

Buckman rushes forward eye patch in hand Anderson heads
straight towards him gunning the engine

w

uckman steadies himself smirks at Anderson savoring
heir twisted game of chicken that is until he
imself chickens out ultimately stepping aside

Pp ct

Like Steve McQueen Anderson hits the fallen picnic table
t serves as a ramp as the bike vaults its way up and over
he townsfolk away from Pleasant Valley and everyone in it

tH

uckman rushes forward impotent as Anderson and Joey make
heir getaway Flanked by his bloody wounded flock
Harper Granny Rufus Lester hell all the maniacs)
uckman grinds his teeth huffing puffing A man insane

B2Adw

The camera slowly MOVES IN on his vacant eye socket as a
WALL OF FIRE covers the frame and we

DISSOLVE TO

INT SHERIFFS STATION - NIGHT

SHERIFF FREIDMAN lounges at his desk reading Famous
Monsters magazine At his feet his loyal hound dog
ELVIS gnaws on a bone Another busy night at the office

BAM The door bolts open Anderson and Joey rush in
bloodied and crazed Sheriff Freidman goes for his gun

ANDERSON
No no no Dont shoot

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
What the Hell is your problem boy

ANDERSON
You gotta help us

JOEY
They killed our friends They murdered

They fucking barbecued our friends

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
What in Gods name you talkin about

ANDERSON
I know it sounds crazy but its
true What she says is true The
folks in Pleasant Valley Theyre
insane Murderers

Behind Anderson in the jail cell CONNIE MASON a
beautiful inexplicably well-groomed inmate grips the bars
of the cell She has a glazed look in her eyes

CONNIE
I told you Sheriff Those people
are maniacs

Freidman glares at Miss Mason She hushes

JOEY
They put this sign on the road
fooled us into coming to their
town Told us we were gonna be
guests for some special Festival

CONNIE
We were just on a trip Just
travelling south

ANDERSON
And then they started killing us
one by one

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Pleasant Valley you say

JOEY
You know Pleasant Valley right

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Yeah I know it all right

The Sheriff takes a deep breath Ponders his intruders
Ponders Miss Mason Decided he puts his gun away

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
I think you me and Elvis need to
take a little ride

Anderson and Joey sigh relief Connie stares forlorn
CONNIE
Feels like Ive been here for
forty years
INTEXT HIGHWAY ROAD - NIGHT
Anderson and Joey ride ahead of the Sheriff who follows
diligently in his squad car hound dog by his side
EXT HIGHWAY ROAD (FURTHER UP) - NIGHT
The infamous hand painted Detour sign lies flat at an
angle atop a pile of sawed-off branches Seeing this the

motorcycle turns off the highway and onto the dirt road
The squad car trails behind

EXT DIRT ROADENTRANCE - NIGHT

The motorcycle drives along the dirt road passing beneath
the Pleasant Valley Population 2001 welcome sign before
coming to a halt Anderson and Joey dismount as the squad
car pulls up behind The Sheriff gets out flips on the
spotlight and aims it at the clearing

EXT CEMETARY - NIGHT

Anderson and Joey now see that they are standing dead
center in the middle of a timeworn burial ground

Rows of graves sprawl before them graves carved with names
frighteningly familiar Virginia Boone Harper Alexander
Hester and Glendora Rufus Lester (and Jez of course)

Anderson and Joey circle round in shock trying to make
sense of it all Sheriff Freidman stares them down

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
I ought to lock you both up for
wastin my precious time This is
your Pleasant Valley Aint nothing
but a graveyard been here the last
hundred fifty years If I hada
dollar for every drunken college
kid come hollerin about flesh
eatin ghouls me and Elvis coulda
retired in comfort years ago

Anderson and Joey back away from Freidman This cant be
happening

JOEY
No There was a town here People
We saw them

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Missy Im just gonna assume youve
been smokin that reefer and let it
go at that

JOEY
No way man Youre full of shit

Sheriff Freidman takes out his handcuffs Anderson steps
forward in defense

ANDERSON
All right Stop Were sorry It
was a joke A prank

The Sheriff puts away the cuffs Smirks

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Im sure the poor souls of these
fine people who died at the hands
of you Northern heathens aint so
partial to your joke

Sheriff Freidman points a marble statue None other than
the chiseled likeness of Mayor George W Buckman himself
Buckman looms tall and proud standing guard over a
tarnished plaque circa 1862 imbedded in the earth below

JOEY
What

Like a teacher proving his history lesson Freidman shines
his flashlight on the plaques inscription

SHERIFF FREIDMAN
Its called respect son

Stunned Anderson and Joey walk over to the plaque Slowly
he begins to read aloud

ANDERSON
To the 2001 innocent confederate
citizens of Pleasant Valley laid to
waste on this very spot by renegade
Yanks during The War Between the
States this plaque is hereby devoted
as a pledge of blood justice An eye
for an eye a tooth for a tooth
never will they rest in peace till
one for one they are avenged

JOEY
Its dated March 22nd Thats
today

The sound of SCREECHING TIRES jolts them to attention They
turn to see the Sheriffs car pulling away the DAWNING SUN
now beginning to peek through the trees

Alone Anderson and Joey survey the desolate landscape
2001 graves
JOEY

Could we really have just imagined

it all Could it possibly be some

kind of joke
Anderson points to the gash in his forehead

ANDERSON
This is real And its no joke

That inbred Sheriff is probably one
of them We gotta do something

JOEY
Maybe if we ride further north
What if we went to the FBI

ANDERSON
Forget the FBI I say we get the
fucking Marines and invade the
South all over again

The WIND blows through the cemetery rustling the leaves of
an old oak tree The effect is that of a ghostly whisper
Or is it laughter

Joey wraps her arms around Anderson

JOEY
Youre on

She seals the pact with a kiss continuing to hold on to
Anderson for a moment of comfort But the moments soon
over when Anderson pulls away and with forceful venom
spits directly onto Buckmans marbled face

The final desecration

ANDERSON
Fuck you Pleasant Valley

With that Anderson takes Joeys hand and heads out

EXT DIRT ROAD OUT OF PLEASANT VALLEY - DAWN

The motorcycle drives past the roadside sign (Pleasant
Valley Population 2001) coursing away from the town

EXT CEMETARY - DAWN

Spittle drips down the stone face of Mayor Buckman which
now appears to be smiling a malevolent grin

EXT DIRT ROAD OUT OF PLEASANT VALLEY - DAWN

Further up ahead

A FIGURE can be seen standing in the center of the road
Anderson slows the bike down and cautiously inches forward

Once closer he and Joey can see that the figure is
Hucklebilly waving his arms and hootin and hollerin

JOEY
Oh no not again

ANDERSON
Fuck that little shit Well drive
around him

Anderson floors the engine and speeds right past
Hucklebilly knocking him flat on his ass

The boy behind them he and Joey turn around to take one
last glimpse at Pleasant Valley They cant help but laugh
with relief

Now turning to face the course ahead they detect a line of
rusty BARBED WIRE extended across the dirt road between two
telephone poles

Its too late to stop Or scream

The motorcycle glides under the sharpened cord which cuts
through the necks of both Anderson and Joey Their

decapitated heads fly from their bodies which continue to
ride the two-wheeler before it comes to a crashing halt and
EXPLODES

The liberated heads emerge from the FLAMES bouncing along
the path like bloody basketballs

With great finesse Hucklebilly runs and scoops them up A
Cheshire grin crosses his face from ear to ear

HUCKLEBILLY
Damn Yankees

A severed head in each hand the boy walks off into the
southern sunrise whistling Dixie

FADE OUT
