Pygmalion

First a sky over chimney pots and church towers with masses of
thundercloud and a black cloud moving toward the sun

Cut to

Piccadilly Circus London Flower sellers (women in shawls with
baskets) seated round the base of the Eros monument Among them
Liza Doolittle the only young one The rest are elderly or middle
aged All including Liza are too poorly clad and dirty to be
attractive Liza is a pathetic draggle tailed creature She offers
bunches of violets to the passers-by like the rest but there is
no business as the sky is darkening and people are looking up
anxiously at the clouds loosening the bands of their umbrellas
and hurrying on The flower sellers are still offering their
wares but no words can be distinguished through the traffic
noises

Cut to

Liza and her next neighbor an elderly woman The audience now has
a better look at Liza but her good looks are not yet
discoverable she is dirty and her ill combed hair is dirty Her
shawl and skirt are old and ugly Her boots are deplorable her
hat an old black straw with a band of violets indescribable The
older woman though also dirty with London grime and no better
dressed is slightly more disciplined by experience She is busy
packing her basket and covering it Liza is listless discouraged
and miserable

OLD WOMAN Now then Liza wake up It’s going to rain something
chronic You going to sit there and get soaked

LIZA O Gawd I avnt sold a bloody thing since five o’clock I
avnt Whats the good of doing anything in this weather

OLD WOMAN Come now talking like that wont elp Better get home
dry than wet

The old woman takes up her basket and hurries off

Thunder much nearer after a flash

Liza looks up and hastily stirs herself to pack her basket She
finishes by putting her hat into the basket and drawing her shawl

over her head Then she rushes off

View of Piccadilly Circus again but it is now raining with the
first heavy drops of a summer shower

People putting up umbrellas turning up the collars of their
coats and beginning to run Also hailing taxis and scrambling
into them
Liza with her basket under arm makes a rush for it and vanishes

Another street scene continuing the business of people caught in a
heavy shower

Freddy a good looking young gentleman aged 20 is on the kerb
hailing taxi after taxi but they are all engaged

FREDDY Tax The cab does not stop Tax Another failure Tax
Another Oh damn He rushes off

Liza comes running with her shawl over her head and her basket
under her arm She disappears in Freddy’s footsteps

Under the portico of the church of St Paul in Covent Garden
London The portico is on the sidewalk level with it and
sheltering it from the rain It’s great columns divide the view of
it into sections

General view of it from the market with the crowd of people
sheltering from heavy rain Mrs Hill her daughter Higgins and
all the rest are in position but they are not distinguishable in
this shot

The church clock chimes the first quarter The clangor must be
fairly loud but not unmusical

Under the portico looking out as from the church wall through the
columns to Covent Garden market Thus all the shelterers have
their backs to the audience except Higgins who stands in the
middle with his back to them listening and making notes cocking
his ears right and left alternately as he listens There is a
babel of conversation but nothing distinguishable

The figure of Higgins should be on the scale of a close-up The
row of backs behind him should be on that of a longer shot so as
to give him comparative magnitude

Higgins is not youthful He is a mature well-built impressive
authoritative man of 40 or thereabouts with a frock coat a
broadbrimmed hat and an Inverness cape

It is important that in age and everything else he should be in
strong contrast to Freddy who is 20 slim goodlooking and very
youthful

A section of the crowded portico viewed from the market Close-up
to the two central pillars The space between them must be enough
to manoeuvre four principals in front of the sheltering crowd

An elderly lady (Mrs Eynsford Hill) and her daughter (Clara) are
in front glumly watching the rain The mother is slight refined
and well-bred The daughter young and blooming is more thickly
built and comparatively bumptious Their dress is in good taste

but not new and not expensive
THE DAUGHTER in the space between the central pillars close to
the one on her left Im getting chilled to the bone What can
Freddy be doing all this time

THE MOTHER On her daughters right Not so long But he ought to
have got us a cab by this

Freddy rushes in out of the rain from the Southampton Street side
and comes between them closing a dripping umbrella He is wet
around the ankles

THE DAUGHTER Well havnt you got a cab

FREDDY Theres not one to be had for love or money

THE MOTHER Oh Freddy there must be one You cant have tried

THE DAUGHTER Its too tiresome Do you expect us to go and get
one ourselves

THE MOTHER You really are very helpless Freddy Go again and
dont come back until you have found a cab

FREDDY Oh very well Ill go Ill go He opens his umbrella
and dashes off but comes into collision with Liza who is
hurrying in for shelter knocking her basket out of her hands A
blinding flash of lightning followed instantly by a rattling peal
of thunder orchestrates the incident

LIZA Nah then Freddy look wh y gowin deah

FREDDY Sorry he rushes off

LIZA picking up her scattered flowers and replacing them in the
basket Theres menners f yer Te-oo banches o voylets trod into
the mad She sits down on the plinth of the column sorting her
flowers on the ladys right

THE MOTHER How do you know that my sons name is Freddy pray
LIZA Ow eez ye-ooa san is e Wal fewd dan y de-ooty bawmz a
mather should eed now bettern to spawl a pore gels flahrzn than
ran awy athaht pyin Will ye-oo py me fthem Here with
apologies this desperate attempt to represent her dialect without
a phonetic alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside
London

THE DAUGHTER Do nothing of the sort mother The idea

THE MOTHER Please allow me Clara Have you any pennies

THE DAUGHTER No Ive nothing smaller than sixpence

LIZA hopefully I can give you change for a tanner kind lady

THE MOTHER to Clara Give it to me Clara parts reluctantly
Now to the girl This is for your flowers
LIZA Thank you kindly lady

THE DAUGHTER Make her give you the change These things are only
a penny a bunch

THE MOTHER Do hold your tongue Clara To the girl You can
keep the change

LIZA Oh thank you lady

THE MOTHER Now tell me how you know that young gentlemans name
LIZA I didnt

THE MOTHER I heard you call him by it Dont try to deceive me

LIZA protesting Whos trying to deceive you I called him Freddy
or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a
stranger and wished to be pleasant She sits down beside her
basket

THE DAUGHTER Sixpence thrown away Really mamma you might have
spared Freddy t h at She retreats in disgust behind the
pillar

An elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into
shelter and closes a dripping umbrella He is in the same plight
as Freddy very wet about the ankles He is in evening dress with
a light overcoat He takes the place left vacant by the daughter

THE GENTLEMAN Phew He goes to the plinth beside Liza puts up
his foot on it and stoops to turn down his trouser ends

THE MOTHER Oh dear She retires sadly and joins her daughter
LIZA taking advantage of the military gentlemans proximity to

establish friendly relations with him Cheer up Captain and buy
a flower off a poor girl

THE GENTLEMAN Im sorry I havnt any change
LIZA I can give you change Captain
THE GENTLEMEN For a sovereign Ive nothing less

LIZA Garn Oh do buy a flower off me Captain I can change half-
a-crown Take this for tuppence

THE GENTLEMAN Now dont be troublesome theres a good girl
Trying his pockets I really havnt any change -- Stop heres
three hapence if thats any use to you he retreats to the other
pillar

LIZA disappointed but thinking three halfpence better than
nothing Thank you sir
THE BYSTANDER to the girl You be careful give him a flower for
it Theres a bloke here behind taking down every blessed word
youre saying All turn to the man who is taking notes

Cut to

Under the portico looking out through the columns to Covent Garden
market the crowd turning round to look at Higgins

Cut to

The whole width of the portico viewed from the market The crowd
with Liza making a frantic scene in front of them Pickering in
the foreground watching the row Single figures or pairs detach
themselves momentarily to speak to Liza or to one another Finally
Higgins pushes through to her

LIZA springing up terrified I aint done nothing wrong by
speaking to the gentleman Ive a right to sell flowers if I keep
off the kerb Hysterically Im a respectable girl so help me I
never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me

General hubbub mostly sympathetic to the flower girl but
deprecating her excessive sensibility Cries of Dont start
hollerin Whos hurting you Nobodys going to touch you Whats the
good of fussing Steady on Easy easy etc come from the
elderly staid spectators who pat her comfortingly Less patient
ones bid her shut her head or ask her roughly what is wrong with
her A remoter group not knowing what the matter is crowd in and
increase the noise with question and answer Whats the row What
she do Where is he A tec taking her down What him Yes him
over there Took money off the gentleman etc

LIZA breaking through them to the gentleman crying wildly Oh
sir dont let him charge me You dunno what it means to me Theyll
take away my character and drive me on the streets for speaking to
gentlemen They--

THE NOTE TAKER coming forward on her right the rest crowding
after him There there there there whos hurting you you silly
girl What do you take me for

THE BYSTANDER Its all right hes a gentleman look at his boots
Close-up between the two central pillars viewed from the market
LIZA still hysterical I take my Bible oath I never said a word--

THE NOTE TAKER overbearing but good-humored Oh shut up shut
up Do I look like a policeman

LIZA far from reassured Then what did you take down my words
for How do I know whether you took me down right You just shew
me what youve wrote about me The note taker opens his book and
holds it steadily under her nose though the pressure of the mob
trying to read it over his shoulders would upset a weaker man
Whats that That aint proper writing I cant read that
THE NOTE TAKER I can Reads reproducing her pronunciation
exactly Cheer ap Keptin n baw ya flahr orf a pore gel

LIZA much distressed Its because I called him Captain I meant
no harm To the gentleman Oh sir dont let him lay a charge
agen me for a word like that You--

THE GENTLEMAN Charge I make no charge To the note taker
Really sir if you are a detective you need not begin protecting
me against molestation by young women until I ask you Anybody
could see that the girl meant no harm

THE BYSTANDERS GENERALLY demonstrating against police espionage
Course they could What business is it of yours You mind your own
affairs He wants promotion he does Taking down peoples words
Girl never said a word to him What harm if she did Nice thing a
girl cant shelter from the rain without being insulted etc
etc etc She is conducted by the more sympathetic demonstrators
back to her plinth where she resumes her seat and struggles with
her emotion

THE BYSTANDER He aint a tec Hes a blooming busybody thats what
he is I tell you look at his be-oots

THE NOTE TAKER turning on him genially And how are all your
people down at Selsey

THE BYSTANDER suspiciously Who told you my people come from
Selsey

THE NOTE TAKER Never you mind They did To the girl How do you
come to be up so far east You were born in Lisson Grove

LIZA appalled Oh what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove
It wasnt fit for a pig to live in and I had to pay four-and-six a
week In tears Oh boo—hoo—oo—

THE NOTE TAKER Live where you like but stop that noise

THE GENTLEMAN to the girl Come come he cant touch you you
have a right to live where you please

LIZA subsiding into a brooding melancholy over her basket and
talking very low-spiritedly to herself Im a good girl I am

THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER not attending to her Do you know where I
come from

THE NOTE TAKER promptly Hoxton

Titterings Popular interest in the note takers performance
increases

THE SARCASTIC ONE amazed Well who said I didnt Bly me You
know everything you do
LIZA still nursing her sense of injury Aint no call to meddle
with me he aint

THE BYSTANDER to her Of course he aint Dont you stand it from
him To the note taker See here what call have you to know
about people what never offered to meddle with you

LIZA Let him say what he likes I dont want to have no truck with
him

THE BYSTANDER You take us for dirt under your feet dont you
Catch you taking liberties with a gentleman

THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER off the gentleman Yes tell him where
he come from if you want to go fortune-telling

THE NOTE TAKER Cheltenham Harrow Cambridge and India

THE GENTLEMAN Quite right

Great laughter Reaction in the note takers favor Exclamations
of He knows all about it Told him proper Hear him tell the toff

where he come from etc

LIZA resenting the reaction Hes no gentleman he aint to
interfere with a poor girl

Long shot shewing the whole portico crowded with shelterers They
all move off except Liza Higgins and Pickering who are left
alone between two of the pillars as before The sky brightens
during the exodus and London is again bathed in sunshine

Back to close-up between the two central pillars viewed from the
market

THE DAUGHTER out of patience pushing her way rudely to the front
and displacing the gentleman who politely retires to the other
side of the pillar What on earth is Freddy doing I shall get
pneumonia if I stay in this draught any longer

THE NOTE TAKER to himself hastily making a note of her
pronunciation of monia as mownia Earls Court

THE DAUGHTER violently Will you please keep your impertinent
remarks to yourself

THE NOTE TAKER Did I say that out loud I didnt mean to I beg
your pardon Your mothers Epsom unmistakably

THE MOTHER advancing between her daughter and the note taker How
very curious I was brought up in Largelady Park near Epsom

THE NOTE TAKER To the daughter You want a cab do you
THE DAUGHTER Dont dare speak to me

THE MOTHER Oh please please Clara Her daughter repudiates her
with an angry shrug and retires haughtily We should be so
grateful to you sir if you found us a cab The note taker
produces a whistle Oh thank you She joins her daughter

The note taker blows a piercing blast

THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER There I knowed he was a plain-clothes
copper

THE BYSTANDER That aint a police whistle thats a sporting
whistle

LIZA still preoccupied with her wounded feelings Hes no right to
take away my character My character is the same to me as any
ladys

THE NOTE TAKER I dont know whether youve noticed it but the rain
stopped about two minutes ago

THE BYSTANDER So it has Why didnt you say so before and us
losing our time listening to your silliness He walks off towards
the Strand

THE MOTHER Its quite fine now Clara We can walk to a motor
bus Come She gathers her skirts above her ankles and hurries
off towards the Strand

THE DAUGHTER But the cab-- her mother is out of hearing Oh
how tiresome She follows angrily

All the rest have gone except the note taker the gentleman and
the flower girl who sits arranging her basket and still pitying
herself in murmurs

LIZA Poor girl Hard enough for her to live without being
worrited and chivied

THE GENTLEMAN returning to his former place on the note takers
left How do you do it if I may ask

THE NOTE TAKER Simply phonetics The science of speech Thats my
profession also my hobby Happy is the man who can make a living
by his hobby Y o u can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his
brogue I can place any man within six miles I can place him
within two miles in London Sometimes within two streets

LIZA Ought to be ashamed of himself unmanly coward

THE GENTLEMAN But is there a living in that

THE NOTE TAKER Oh yes Quite a fat one This is an age of
upstarts who have to be taught to speak like ladies and gentlemen
Now I can teach them--

LIZA Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl--

THE NOTE TAKER explosively Woman cease this detestable
boohooing instantly or else seek the shelter of some other place
of worship

LIZA with feeble defiance Ive a right to be here if I like same
as you

THE NOTE TAKER A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting
sounds has no right to be anywhere -- no right to live Remember
that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of
articulate speech that your native language is the language of
Shakespear and Milton and The Bible and dont sit there crooning
like a bilious pigeon

Close-up of Liza

LIZA quite overwhelmed and looking up at him in mingled wonder
and deprecation without daring to raise her head Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-
ow-oo

THE NOTE TAKER whipping out his book Heavens what a sound He
writes then holds out the book and reads reproducing her vowels
exactly Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-ow-oo

LIZA tickled by the performance and laughing in spite of
herself Garn

THE NOTE TAKER You hear this creature with her kerbstone English
the English that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her
days Well sir in three months I could pass that girl off as a
duchess at an ambassadors garden party I could even get her a
place as ladys maid or shop assistant which requires better
English

LIZA What’s that you say

THE NOTE TAKER turning crushingly on her Yes you squashed
cabbage leaf you disgrace to the noble architecture of these
columns you incarnate insult to the English language I could
pass you off as the Queen of Sheba To the Gentleman Can you
believe that

THE GENTLEMAN Of course I can I am myself a student of Indian
dialects and--

THE NOTE TAKER eagerly Are you Do you know Colonel Pickering
the author of Spoken Sanscrit

THE GENTLEMAN I a m Colonel Pickering Who are you

THE NOTE TAKER Henry Higgins author of Higginss Universal

PICKERING Im at the Carlton Come and dine with me
HIGGINS Right you are

LIZA to Pickering as he passes her Buy a flower kind
gentleman Im short for my lodging

PICKERING I really havnt any change Im sorry he goes away

HIGGINS shocked at girls mendacity Liar You said you could
change half-a-crown

LIZA rising in desperation You ought to be stuffed with nails
you ought Flinging the basket at his feet Take the whole

blooming basket for sixpence

The church clock strikes the second quarter

BOYS’ VOICES singing within the church they are practicing the
102nd Psalm Hear my prayer O Lord and let my cry come unto Thee
Hide not Thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble etc
etc etc

HIGGINS hearing in it the voice of God rebuking him for his
Pharisaic want of charity to the poor girl A reminder He raises
his hat solemnly then throws a handful of money into the basket
and follows Pickering

Under the portico looking out through the two pillars to the
roadway with the market beyond (the previous scene from the
opposite end)

LIZA picking up a half-crown Ah-ow-ooh Picking up a couple of
florins Aaah-ow-ooh Picking up several coins Aaaaaah-ow-ooh

Picking up a half-sovereign Aaaaaaaaaaaah-ow-ooh

A taxi rolls up and stops

FREDDY springing out of the cab Hallo To the girl Where are
the two ladies that were here

LIZA They walked to the bus when the rain stopped
FREDDY And left me with a cab on my hands Damnation

LIZA with grandeur Never you mind young man Im going home in
a taxi She sails off to the cab The driver puts his hand behind
him and holds the door firmly shut against her Quite
understanding his mistrust she shews him her handful of money A
taxi fare aint no object to me Charlie He grins and opens the
door Here What about the basket

THE TAXIMAN Give it here Tuppence extra
LIZA No I don’t want nobody to see it She crushes it into the
cab and gets in continuing the conversation through the window
Goodbye Freddy

FREDDY dazedly raising his hat Goodbye

TAXIMAN Where to

LIZA Bucknam Pellis Buckingham Palace

TAXIMAN What d’ye mean -- Bucknam Pellis

LIZA Dont you know where it is In the Green Park where the King
lives To Freddy Dont let me keep you standing there Goodbye

FREDDY Goodbye He goes

TAXIMAN Here What’s all this about Bucknam Pellis What business

LIZA Of course I avnt none But I wasnt going to let him know

TAXIMAN And wheres home

LIZA Angel Court Drury Lane next Meiklejohns oil shop
TAXIMAN That sounds more like it Judy He drives off
Dissolve to

The entrance to Angel Court a narrow little archway between two
shops one of them Meiklejohns oil shop When it stops there
Liza gets out dragging her basket with her

LIZA How much

TAXIMAN indicating the taximeter Cant you read A shilling
LIZA A shilling for two minutes

TAXIMAN Two minutes or ten it’s all the same

LIZA I dont call it right

TAXIMAN Ever been in a taxi before

LIZA with dignity Hundreds and thousands of times young man
TAXIMAN laughing at her Good for you Judy Keep the shilling
darling with best love from all at home Good luck He drives
off

LIZA humiliated Impidence

She picks up the basket and trudges up the alley through the
archway
Angel Court in perspective from under the archway A typical
little London alley

Back view of Liza wearily dragging along with her basket She
disappears into a doorway

No dialogue

Liza’s lodging A small room with very old wall paper hanging
loose in the damp places A broken pane in the window is mended
with paper A portrait of a popular actor and a fashion plate of
ladies’ dresses all wildly beyond poor Liza’s means both torn
from newspapers are pinned up on the wall A birdcage hangs in
the window but its tenant died long ago it remains as a memorial
only

These are the only visible luxuries the rest is the irreducible
minimum of poverty’s needs a wretched bed heaped with all sorts
of coverings that have any warmth in them a draped packing case
with a basin and jug on it and a little looking class over it a
chair and table the refuse of some suburban kitchen and an
American alarm clock on a shelf above the unused fireplace

Liza comes in and dumps her basket on the floor with a sigh of
relief She takes off her shawl and spreads it on the bed She
sits at the table and takes handfuls of money from the pocket of
her apron She balances the silver in one hand covers it with the
other and jingles it at her ear like a child’s rattle

Close-up of Liza jingling the money at her ear Her habitual
anxious poor woman’s expression changes very gradually into a
happy smile This fades out into

Close-up of Liza still in her dirty make-up wearing her best
hat with three enormous ostrich feathers She looks dreadfully
ugly in it but very self-satisfied This fades out into

Close-up of Liza in a coronet and diamonds like Queen Alexandra
but with an expression of extreme hauteur She is still ridiculous
in her dirty make-up This again fades out into

Her bedroom again after nightfall The candle is lighted and on
the table is a big thick cup and a knife the remains of her
supper (She has treated herself to a cup of cocoa anda
“doorstep”) The hat with the three feathers is on the table She
is sitting at the table

She sweeps the crumbs of the doorstep into her palm with the
knife and throws them into her mouth She drinks up the last of
the cocoa

She rises and puts the hat away carefully in the packing case She
takes off her skirt and spreads it on the bed She takes the
candle from the chimney board and puts it on the chair within
reach of the bed She sits on the bed and pulls off her boots and
stockings She goes to bed without any further change She blows
out the candle
The darkness fades into

Next day at 11 am Higginss laboratory in Wimpole Street It is
a room on the first floor looking on the street and was meant
for the drawing-room The double doors are in the middle of the
back wall and persons entering find in the corner to their right
two tall file cabinets at right angles to one another against the
walls In this corner stands a flat writing-table on which are a
phonograph a laryngoscope a row of tiny organ pipes with a
bellows a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners
attached to a gas plug in the wall by an indiarubber tube several
tuning-forks of different sizes a life-size image of half a human
head showing in section the vocal organs and a box containing a
supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph

Further down the room on the same side is a fireplace with a
comfortable leather-covered easy-chair at the side of the hearth
nearest the door and a coal-scuttle There is a clock on the
mantelpiece Between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a
stand for newspapers

On the other side of the central door to the left of the visitor
is a cabinet of shallow drawers On it is a telephone and the
telephone directory The corner beyond and most of the side wall
is occupied by a grand piano with the keyboard at the end
furthest from the door and a bench for the player extending the
full length of the keyboard On the piano is a dessert dish heaped
with fruit and sweets mostly chocolates

The middle of the room is clear Besides the easy-chair the piano
bench and two chairs at the phonograph table there is one stray
chair It stands near the fireplace On the walls engravings
mostly Piranesis and mezzotint portraits No paintings

Pickering is seated at the table putting down some cards and a
tuning-fork which he has been using Higgins is standing up near
him closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out He
appears in the morning light as a robust vital appetizing sort
of man of forty or thereabouts dressed in a professional-looking
black frock-coat with a white linen collar and black silk tie He
is of the energetic scientific type heartily even violently
interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific
subject and careless about himself and other people including
their feelings He is in fact but for his years and size rather
like a very impetuous baby taking notice eagerly and loudly and
requiring almost as much watching to keep him out of unintended
mischief His manner varies from genial bullying when he is ina
good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong but he is
so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable even
in his least reasonable moments

HIGGINS as he shuts the last drawer Well I think thats the
whole show

PICKERING Its really amazing I havnt taken half of it in you
know

HIGGINS Would you like to go over any of it again

PICKERING rising and coming to the fireplace where he plants
himself with his back to the fire No thank you not now Im
quite done up for this morning

Higgins goes over to the piano and eats candies

Mrs Pearce his housekeeper comes in She is middleaged and
very respectable and dignified

HIGGINS Whats the matter

MRS PEARCE hesitating evidently perplexed A young woman wants
to see you sir

HIGGINS A young woman What does she want

MRS PEARCE Well sir she says youll be glad to see her when you
know what shes come about Shes quite a common girl sir Very
common indeed I should have sent her away only I thought perhaps
you wanted her to talk into your machines

HIGGINS to Pickering Lets have her up Shew her up Mrs Pearce
he rushes across to his working table and picks out a cylinder to
use on the phonograph

MRS PEARCE only half resigned to it Very well sir Its for
you to say She goes downstairs

HIGGINS This is rather a bit of luck Ill shew you how I make
records Well set her talking and Ill take it down first in
Bells visible Speech then in broad Romic and then well get her
on the phonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like
with the written transcript before you

MRS PEARCE returning This is the young woman sir

Liza enters in state She has a hat with three ostrich feathers
orange sky-blue and red She has a nearly clean apron and the
shoddy coat has been tidied a little The pathos of this
deplorable figure with its innocent vanity and consequential air
touches Pickering who has already straightened himself in the
presence of Mrs Pearce But as to Higgins the only distinction
he makes between men and women is that when he is neither bullying
nor exclaiming to the heavens against some featherweight cross he
coaxes women as a child coaxes its nurse when it wants to get
anything out of her

HIGGINS brusquely recognizing her with unconcealed
disappointment and at once babylike making an intolerable
grievance of it Why this is the girl I jotted down yesterday
when I was sheltering from the rain To the girl Be off with
you I dont want you
LIZA Dont you be so saucy You aint heard what I come for yet
To Mrs Pearce who is waiting at the door for further
instruction Did you tell him I come in a taxi

MRS PEARCE Nonsense girl what do you think a gentleman like
Mr Higgins cares what you came in

LIZA Oh we a r e proud He aint above giving lessons not him I
heard him say so Well I aint come here to ask for any
compliment and if my moneys not good enough I can go elsewhere

HIGGINS Pickering shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall
we throw her out of the window

LIZA running away in terror to the piano where she turns at bay
Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-ow-oo Wounded and whimpering I wont be called a
baggage when Ive offered to pay like any lady

Motionless the two men stare at her from the other side of the
room amazed

PICKERING gently What is it you want my girl

LIZA I want to be a lady in a flower shop But they wont take me
unless I can talk more genteel He said he could teach me Well
here I am ready to pay him -- not asking any favor -- and he
treats me zif I was dirt

HIGGINS thundering at her Sit down
MRS PEARCE severely Sit down girl Do as youre told She

places the stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and
Pickering and stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down

THE FLOWER GIRL Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-oo She stands half rebellious
half bewildered

PICKERING very courteous Wont you sit down He places the stray
chair near the hearthrug between himself and Higgins

LIZA coyly Dont mind if I do She sits down Pickering returns
to the hearthrug

HIGGINS Whats your name

LIZA Liza Doolittle

HIGGINS declaiming gravely

Eliza Elizabeth Betsy and Bess

They went to the woods to get a bird nes
PICKERING They found a nest with four eggs in it

HIGGINS They took one apiece and left three in it

They laugh heartily at their own fun
PICKERING Higgins Im interested What about the ambassadors
garden party Ill say youre the greatest teacher alive if you
make that good Ill bet you all the expenses of the experiment
you cant do it And Ill pay for the lessons

LIZA Oh you are real good Thank you Captain

HIGGINS tempted looking at her Its almost irresistible Shes
so deliciously low -- so horribly dirty--

LIZA protesting extremely Ah-ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-oo-oo I aint
dirty I washed my face and hands afore I come I did

HIGGINS You don’t know what washing means Never mind becoming
excited as the idea grows on him I shall make a duchess of this
draggle-tailed guttersnipe

LIZA strongly deprecating this view of her Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-oo

HIGGINS carried away Yes in six months -- in three if she has a
good ear and a quick tongue -- Ill take her anywhere and pass her
off as anything Well start today now this moment Take her
away and clean her Mrs Pearce Is there a good fire in the
kitchen

MRS PEARCE protesting Yes but—

HIGGINS storming on Take all her clothes off and burn them Ring
up Whitely or somebody for new ones Wrap her up in brown paper
til they come

LIZA Youre no gentleman youre not to talk of such things Ima
good girl I am and I know what the like of you are I do

HIGGINS We want none of your slum prudery here young woman
Youve got to learn to behave like a duchess Take her away Mrs
Pearce If she gives you any trouble wallop her

LIZA rising and squaring herself determinedly Im going away
Hes off his chump he is I dont want no balmies teaching me

HIGGINS wounded in his tenderest point by her insensibility to
his elocution Oh indeed Im mad am I Very well Mrs Pearce
you neednt order the new clothes for her Throw her out

LIZA whimpering Nah-ow You got no right to touch me

MRS PEARCE You see now what comes of being saucy Indicating
the door This way please

LIZA almost in tears I didnt want no clothes I wouldnt have
taken them

HIGGINS intercepting her on her reluctant way to the door Youre
an ungrateful wicked girl This is my return for offering to take
you out of the gutter and dress you beautifully and make a lady of
you
MRS PEARCE Stop Mr Higgins I wont allow it Its you that are
wicked Go home to your parents girl and tell them to take
better care of you

LIZA I aint got no parents They told me I was big enough to earn
my own living and turned me out

MRS PEARCE Wheres your mother

LIZA I aint got no mother Her that turned me out was my sixth
stepmother But I done without them And Im a good girl I am

HIGGINS Very well then what on earth is all this fuss about
The girl doesnt belong to anybody -- is no use to anybody but me
He goes to Mrs Pearce and begins coaxing You can adopt her
Mrs Pearce Im sure a daughter would be a great amusement to
you Now dont make any more fuss Take her downstairs and--

MRS PEARCE But whats to become of her Is she to be paid
anything Do be sensible sir

HIGGINS Oh pay her whatever is necessary put it down in the
housekeeping book Impatiently What on earth will she want with
money Shell have her food and her clothes Shell only drink if
you give her money

LIZA turning on him Oh you a r e a brute Its a lie nobody
ever saw the sign of liquor on me

PICKERING in good-humored remonstrance Does it occur to you
Higgins that the girl has some feelings

HIGGINS looking critically at her Oh no I dont think so Not
any feelings that we need bother about Cheerily Have you
Eliza

LIZA I got my feelings same as anyone else

HIGGINS to Pickering reflectively You see the difficulty

PICKERING Eh What difficulty

HIGGINS To get her to talk grammar The mere pronunciation is
easy enough

LIZA I dont want to talk grammar I want to talk like a lady ina
flower shop

MRS PEARCE Will you please keep to the point Mr Higgins I
want to know on what terms the girl is to be here Is she to have
any wages And what is to become of her when youve finished your
teaching You must look ahead a little

HIGGINS impatiently Whats to become of her if I leave her in the
gutter Tell me that Mrs Pearce
MRS PEARCE Thats her own business not yours Mr Higgins

HIGGINS Well when Ive done with her we can throw her back into
the gutter and then it will be her own business again so thats
all right

LIZA Oh youve no feeling heart in you you dont care for nothing
but yourself she rises and takes the floor resolutely Here Ive
had enough of this Im going making for the door You ought to

be ashamed of yourself you ought

HIGGINS snatching a chocolate cream from the piano his eyes
suddenly beginning to twinkle with mischief Have some chocolates
Eliza

LIZA halting tempted How do I know what might be in them Ive
heard of girls being drugged by the like of you

Higgins whips out his penknife cuts a chocolate in two puts one
half into his mouth and bolts it and offers her the other half

HIGGINS Pledge of good faith Eliza I eat one half you eat the
other Liza opens her mouth to retort he pops the half chocolate
into it You shall have boxes of them barrels of them every
day You shall live on them Eh

LIZA who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked
by it I wouldnt have ate it only Im too ladylike to take it out
of my mouth

HIGGINS Listen Eliza I think you said you came in a taxi

LIZA Well what if I did Ive as good a right to take a taxi as
anyone else

HIGGINS You have Eliza and in future you shall have as many
taxis as you want You shall go up and down and round the town in
a taxi every day Think of that Eliza

MRS PEARCE Mr Higgins youre tempting the girl Its not right
She should think of the future

HIGGINS At her age Nonsense Time enough to think of the future
when you havnt any future to think of No Eliza do as this lady
does think of other peoples futures but never think of your
own Think of chocolates and taxis and gold and diamonds

LIZA No I dont want no gold and no diamonds Im a good girl I
am

HIGGINS You shall remain so Eliza under the care of Mrs
Pearce And you shall marry an officer in the Guards with a
beautiful moustache the son of a marquis who will disinherit him
for marrying you but will relent when he sees your beauty and
goodness-—

PICKERING Excuse me Higgins but I really must interfere Mrs
Pearce is quite right If this girl is to put herself in your
hands for six months for an experiment in teaching she must
understand thoroughly what shes doing

HIGGINS How can she Shes incapable of understanding anything
Besides do any of us understand what we are doing If we did
would we ever do it

PICKERING Very clever Higgins but not sound sense To Eliza
Miss Doolittle--

LIZA overwhelmed Ah-ah-ow-oo

HIGGINS There Thats all you get out of Eliza Ah-ah-ow-oo No
use explaining As a military man you ought to know that Give her
her orders thats enough for her Eliza you are to live here for
the next six months learning how to speak beautifully like a
lady in a florists shop If youre good and do whatever youre
told you shall sleep in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat
and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis If youre
naughty and idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the
black beetles and be walloped by Mrs Pearce with a broomstick
At the end of six months you shall go to Buckingham Palace in a
carriage beautifully dressed If the King finds out youre not a
lady you will be taken by the police to the Tower of London
where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous
flower girls If you are not found out you shall have a present
of seven-and-sixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop If
you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked
girl and the angels will weep for you To Pickering Now are you
satisfied Pickering To Mrs Pearce Can I put it more plainly
and fairly Mrs Pearce

MRS PEARCE patiently I think youd better let me speak to the
girl properly in private I dont know that I can take charge of
her or consent to the arrangement at all Of course I know you
dont mean her any harm but when you get what you call interested
in peoples accents you never think or care what may happen to
them or you Come with me Eliza

HIGGINS Thats all right Thank you Mrs Pearce Bundle her off
to the bath-room

LIZA rising reluctantly and suspiciously Youre a great bully
you are I wont stay here if I dont like I wont let nobody wallop
me I never asked to go to Bucknam Pellis I didnt I was never in
trouble with the police not me Im a good girl--

MRS PEARCE Dont answer back girl You dont understand the
gentleman Come with me She leads the way to the door and holds
it open for Eliza

LIZA as she goes out Well what I say is right I wont go near
the king not if Im going to have my head cut off If Id known
what I was letting myself in for I wouldnt have come here I
always been a good girl and I never offered to say a word to him
and I dont owe him nothing and I dont care and I wont be put
upon and I have my feelings the same as anyone else--

Mrs Pearce shuts the door and Elizas plaints are no longer
audible

Cut to

Liza and Mrs Pearce on the stairs Mrs Pearce leading the way
upstairs Liza is still grumbling the last three or four lines of
her speech I always been a good girl etc etc

The landing above Two doors

MRS PEARCE Opening one of the doors I will have to put you
here This will be your bedroom They go in

Inside the room a good servant’s bedroom light clean and
cheerful The two women enter

LIZA O-oh I couldnt sleep here missus It’s too good for the
likes of me I should be afraid to touch anything I aint a
duchess yet you know

MRS PEARCE You have got to make yourself as clean as the room
then you wont be afraid of it She goes to another door And you
must call me Mrs Pearce not missus She goes through it Liza
following

A bathroom with a couple of bath gowns hanging up Mrs Pearce
comes in followed by Liza

LIZA Gawd whats this Is this where you wash clothes Funny sort
of copper I call it

MRS PEARCE It is not a copper This is where we wash ourselves
Eliza and where I am going to wash you

LIZA You expect me to get into that and wet myself all over Not
me I should catch my death I knew a woman did it every Saturday
night and she died of it

MRS PEARCE Mr Higgins has the gentlemen’s bathroom downstairs
and he has a bath every morning in cold water

LIZA Ugh Hes made of iron that man

MRS PEARCE If you are to sit with him and the Colonel and be
taught you will have to do the same They wont like the smell of
you if you dont But you can have the water as hot as you like
There are two taps hot and cold

LIZA weeping I couldnt I dursnt Its not natural it would kill
me Ive never had a bath in my life not what youd call a proper
one

MRS PEARCE Well dont you want to be clean and sweet and decent
like a lady You know you cant be a nice girl inside if youre a
dirty slut outside
LIZA Boohoo

MRS PEARCE Now stop crying and go back into your room and take
off all your clothes Then wrap yourself in this Taking down a
gown from its peg and handing it to her and come back to me I
will get the bath ready

LIZA all tears I cant I wont I’m not used to it Ive never
taken off all my clothes before Its not right its not decent

MRS PEARCE Nonsense child Dont you take off all your clothes
every night when you go to bed

LIZA amazed No Why should I I should catch my death Of course
I take off my skirt

MRS PEARCE Do you mean that you sleep in the underclothes you
wear in the daytime

LIZA What else have I to sleep in

MRS PEARCE You will never do that again as long as you live
here I will get you a proper nightdress

LIZA Do you mean change into cold things and lie awake shivering
half the night You want to kill me you do

MRS PEARCE I want to change you from a frowzy slut to a clean
respectable girl fit to sit with the gentlemen in the study Are
you going to trust me and do what I tell you or be thrown out and
sent back to your flower basket

LIZA But you dont know what the cold is to me You dont know how
I dread it

MRS PEARCE Your bed wont be cold here I will put a hot water
bottle in it Pushing her into the bedroom Off with you and
undress

LIZA Oh if only I’d a known what a dreadful thing it is to be
clean I’d never have come I didnt know when I was well off I--
Mrs Pearce pushes her through the door but leaves it partly open
lest her her prisoner should take to flight

Mrs Pearce puts on a pair of white rubber sleeves and fills the
bath mixing hot and cold and testing the result with the bath
thermometer She perfumes it with a handful of bath salts and adds
a palmful of mustard She then takes a formidable looking long
handled scrubbing brush and soaps it profusely with a ball of
scented soap

Liza comes back with nothing on but the bath gown huddled tightly
round her a piteous spectacle of abject terror

MRS PEARCE Now come along Take that thing off
LIZA Oh I couldnt Mrs Pearce I reely couldnt I never done such
a thing

MRS PEARCE Nonsense Here step in and tell me whether it’s hot
enough for you

LIZA Ah-oo Ah-oo It’s too hot

MRS PEARCE deftly snatching the gown away and throwing Liza down
on her back It wont hurt you She sets to work with the
scrubbing brush

Liza’s screams are heartrending

The shot fades out in a tempest of yells from Liza and a vigorous
lathering by Mrs Pearce

Fade in
The laboratory as before
Higgins and Pickering seated reading

Mrs Pearce with her rubber sleeves still on enters with Japanese
clothes hanging on her arm

HIGGINS Oh That you Mrs Pearce What the devil has been going
on upstairs Somebody was screaming the house down

MRS PEARCE That’s all right sir It won’t occur again Might
she use some of those Japanese dresses you brought from abroad
Shes perfectly clean now I really cant put her back into her old
things Its only until the new clothes come

HIGGINS Certainly Anything you like Is that all

MRS PEARCE No sir I’m sorry to have to tell you that the
troubles beginning already Theres a dustman downstairs Alfred
Doolittle wants to see you He says you have his daughter here
PICKERING Phew I say

HIGGINS Send the blackguard up

MRS PEARCE Dont give her up to him sir I dont like his looks
I’ll take care of the girl sir

Mrs Pearce goes out
PICKERING He may not be a blackguard Higgins
HIGGINS Nonsense Of course he’s a blackguard

PICKERING Whether he is or not Im afraid we shall have some
trouble with him
HIGGINS confidently Oh no I think not If theres any trouble he
shall have it with me not I with him

Alfred Doolittle is an elderly but vigorous dustman clad in the
costume of his profession including a hat with a back brim
covering his neck and shoulders He has well marked and rather
interesting features and seems equally free from fear and
conscience He has a remarkably expressive voice the result of a
habit of giving vent to his feelings without reserve His present
pose is that of wounded honor and stern resolution

DOOLITTLE at the door uncertain which of the two gentlemen is
his man Professor Iggins

HIGGINS Here Good morning Sit down

DOOLITTLE Morning Governor He sits down magisterially I come
about a very serious matter Governor

HIGGINS to Pickering Brought up in Hounslow Mother Welsh I
should think Doolittle opens his mouth amazed Higgins
continues What do you want Doolittle

DOOLITTLE menacingly I want my daughter thats what I want See

HIGGINS Of course you do Youre her father arnt you You dont
suppose anyone else wants her do you Im glad to see you have
some spark of family feeling left Shes upstairs Take her away at
once

DOOLITTLE rising fearfully taken aback What

HIGGINS Take her away Do you suppose Im going to keep your
daughter for you

DOOLITTLE remonstrating Now now look here Governor Is this
reasonable Is it fairity to take advantage of a man like this
The girl belongs to me You got her Where do I come in He sits
down again

HIGGINS Your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and
ask me to teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a
place in a flower-shop This gentleman and my housekeeper have
been here all the time Bullying him How dare you come here and
attempt to blackmail me You sent her here on purpose

DOOLITTLE protesting No Governor

HIGGINS You must have How else could you possibly know that she
is here

DOOLITTLE Dont take a man up like that Governor
HIGGINS The police shall take you up This is a plant -- a plot

to extort money by threats I shall telephone for the police he
goes resolutely to the telephone and opens the directory
DOOLITTLE Have I asked you for a brass farthing I leave it to
the gentleman here have I said a word about money

HIGGINS throwing the book aside and marching down on Doolittle
with a poser What else did you come for

DOOLITTLE sweetly Well what woulda man come for Be human
Governor

HIGGINS So you came to rescue her from worse than death eh

DOOLITTLE appreciatively relieved at being so well understood
Just so Governor Thats right

HIGGINS Well take her away
DOOLITTLE Have I said a word about taking her away Have I now

HIGGINS determinedly Youre going to take her away double quick
He crosses to the hearth and rings the bell

DOOLITTLE rising No Governor Dont say that Im not the man to
stand in my girls light Heres a career opening for her as you
might say and--

Mrs Pearce opens the door and awaits orders

HIGGINS Mrs Pearce this is Elizas father He has come to take
her away Give her to him He goes back to the piano with an air
of washing his hands of the whole affair

DOOLITTLE No This is a misunderstanding Listen here--

MRS PEARCE He cant take her away Mr Higgins how can he You
told me to burn her clothes

DOOLITTLE Thats right I cant carry the girl through the streets
like a blooming monkey can I I put it to you

HIGGINS You have put it to me that you want your daughter Take
your daughter If she has no clothes go out and buy her some

DOOLITTLE desperate Wheres the clothes she come in Did I burn
them or did your missus here

MRS PEARCE I am the housekeeper if you please I have sent for
some clothes for your girl When they come you can take her away
You can wait in the kitchen This way please

Doolittle much troubled accompanies her to the door then
hesitates finally turns confidentially to Higgins

DOOLITTLE Listen here Governor You and me is men of the world
aint we HIGGINS Oh Men of the world are we Youd better go
Mrs Pearce MRS PEARCE I think so indeed sir She goes with
dignity PICKERING The floor is yours Mr Doolittle
DOOLITTLE to Pickering I thank you Governor To Higgins who
takes refuge on the piano bench a little overwhelmed by the
proximity of his visitor for Doolittle has a professional flavor
of dust about him Well the truth is Ive taken a sort of fancy
to you Governor and if you want the girl Im not so set on
having her back home again but what I might be open to an
arrangement Regarded in the light of a young woman shes a fine
handsome girl As a daughter shes not worth her keep and so I
tell you straight All I ask is my rights as a father and youre
the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing for I
can see youre one of the straight sort Governor Well whats a
five pound note to you And whats Eliza to me He returns to his
chair and sits down judicially

PICKERING I think you ought to know Doolittle that Mr
Higginss intentions are entirely honorable

DOOLITTLE Course they are Governor If I thought they wasnt Id
ask fifty

HIGGINS revolted Do you mean to say that you would sell your
daughter for £50

DOOLITTLE Not in a general way I wouldnt but to oblige a
gentleman like you Id do do a good deal I do assure you

PICKERING Have you no morals man

DOOLITTLE unabashed Cant afford them Governor Neither could
you if you was as poor as me Not that I mean any harm you know
But if Liza is going to have a bit out of this why not me too

HIGGINS troubled I dont know what to do Pickering There can be
no question that as a matter of morals its a positive crime to
give this chap a farthing And yet I feel a sort of rough justice
in his claim

DOOLITTLE Thats it Governor Thats all I say A fathers heart
as it were

PICKERING Well I know the feeling but really it seems hardly
right--

DOOLITTLE Dont say that Governor Dont look at it that way What
am I Governors both I ask you what am I Im one of the
undeserving poor thats what I am Think of what that means to a
man It means that hes up agen middle class morality all the time
If theres anything going and I put in for a bit of it its
always the same story Youre undeserving so you cant have it
But my needs is as great as the most deserving widows that ever
got money out of six different charities in one week for the death
of the same husband I dont need less than a deserving man I need
more I dont eat less hearty than him and I drink a lot more I
want a bit of amusement cause Im a thinking man I want
cheerfulness and a song and a band when I feel low Well they
charge me just the same for everything as they charge the
deserving What is middle class morality Just an excuse for never
giving me anything Therefore I ask you as two gentlemen not to
play that game on me Im playing straight with you I aint
pretending to be deserving Im undeserving and I mean to go on
being undeserving I like it and thats the truth Will you take
advantage of a mans nature to do him out of the price of his own
daughter what hes brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of
his brow until shes growed big enough to be interesting to you two
gentlemen Is five pounds unreasonable I put it to you and I
leave it to you

HIGGINS Pickering shall I give him a fiver
PICKERING Hell make a bad use of it Im afraid

DOOLITTLE Not me Governor so help me I wont Dont you be afraid
that Ill save it and spare it and live idle on it There wont be
a penny of it left by Monday Ill have to go to work same as if
Id never had it It wont pauperize me you bet Just one good
spree for myself and the missus giving pleasure to ourselves and
employment to others and satisfaction to you to think its not
been throwed away You couldnt spend it better

HIGGINS taking out his pocket book and coming between Doolittle
and the piano This is irresistible Lets give him ten He offers
two notes to the dustman

DOOLITTLE No Governor She wouldnt have the heart to spend ten
and perhaps I shouldnt neither Ten pounds is a lot of money it
makes a man feel prudent like and then goodbye to happiness You
give me what I ask you Governor not a penny more and not a
penny less

HIGGINS To Doolittle Five pounds I think you said

DOOLITTLE Thank you kindly Governor

HIGGINS Youre sure you wont take ten

DOOLITTLE Not now Another time Governor

HIGGINS handing him a five-pound note Here you are

DOOLITTLE Thank you Governor Good morning He hurries to the
door anxious to get away with his booty When he opens it he is
confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young Japanese lady
in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with small white
jasmine blossoms Mrs Pearce is with her He gets out of her way
deferentially and apologizes Beg pardon miss

THE JAPANESE LADY Garn Dont you know your own daughter
Doolittle Higgins and Pickering exclaiming simultaneously
DOOLITTLE Bly me its Eliza

HIGGINS Whats that This
PICKERING By Jove
DOOLITTLE with fatherly pride Well I never thought shed clean
up as good looking as that Governor Shes a credit to me aint
she And shell soon pick up your free-and-easy ways

LIZA Im a good girl I am and I wont pick up no free and easy
ways

HIGGINS Eliza if you say again that youre a good girl your
father shall take you home

LIZA Not him You dont know my father All he come here for was
to touch you for some money to get drunk on

DOOLITTLE Well what else would I want money for To put into the
plate in church I suppose She puts out her tongue at him He is
so incensed by this that Pickering presently finds it necessary to
step between them Dont you give me none of your lip and dont
let me hear you giving this gentleman any of it neither or youll
hear from me about it See

HIGGINS Have you any further advice to give her before you go
Doolittle Your blessing for instance

DOOLITTLE No Governor I aint such a mug as to put up my
children to all I know myself Hard enough to hold them in without
that If you want Elizas mind improved Governor you do it
yourself with a strap So long gentlemen He turns to go

HIGGINS impressively Stop Youll come regularly to see your
daughter Its your duty you know My brother is a clergyman and
he could help you in your talks with her

DOOLITTLE evasively Certainly Ill come Governor Not just
this week because I have a job at a distance But later on you
may depend on me Afternoon gentlemen Afternoon maam He takes
off his hat to Mrs Pearce who disdains the salutation and goes
out He winks at Higgins thinking him probably a fellow-sufferer
from Mrs Pearces difficult disposition and follows her

LIZA Dont you believe the old liar Hed as soon you set a bull-
dog on him as a clergyman You wont see him again in a hurry

HIGGINS I dont want to Eliza Do you

LIZA Not me I dont want never to see him again I dont Aint you
going to call me Miss Doolittle any more

PICKERING I beg your pardon Miss Doolittle It was a slip of the
tongue

LIZA Oh I dont mind only it sounded so genteel I should just
like to take a taxi to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get
out there and tell it to wait for me just to put the girls in
their place a bit I wouldnt speak to them you know

PICKERING Better wait til we get you something really
fashionable
HIGGINS Besides you shouldnt cut your old friends now that you
have risen in the world Thats what we call snobbery

LIZA You dont call the like of them my friends now I should
hope Theyve took it out of me often enough with their ridicule
when they had the chance and now I mean to get a bit of my own
back But if Im to have fashionable clothes Ill wait

MRS PEARCE coming back Now Eliza The new things have come for
you to try on

LIZA Ah-ow-oo-ooh She rushes out

MRS PEARCE following her Oh dont rush about like that girl
She shuts the door behind her

HIGGINS Pickering we have taken on a stiff job
PICKERING with conviction Higgins we have
Dissolve to

The study the following day

Liza in her new clothes and feeling her inside out of step by a
lunch dinner and breakfast of a kind to which it is
unaccustomed is seated with Higgins and the Colonel feeling like
a hospital out-patient at a first encounter with the doctors

Higgins constitutionally unable to sit still discomposes her
still more by striding restlessly about But for the reassuring
presence and quietude of her friend the Colonel she would run for
her life even back to Drury Lane

HIGGINS Say your alphabet

LIZA I know my alphabet Do you think I know nothing I dont need
to be taught like a child

HIGGINS thundering Say your alphabet

PICKERING Say it Miss Doolittle You will understand presently
Do what he tells you and let him teach you in his own way

LIZA Oh well if you put it like that -- Ahyee beyee ceyee
deyee --

HIGGINS with the roar of a wounded lion Stop Listen to this
Pickering This is what we pay for as elementary education This
unfortunate animal has been locked up for nine years in school at
our expense to teach her to speak and read the language of
Shakespear and Milton And the result is Ahyee beyee ceyee
deyee To Eliza Say A B C D

LIZA almost in tears But I’m saying it Ahyee beyee ceyee --
HIGGINS Stop Say a cup of tea
LIZA A cappete-ee

HIGGINS Put your tongue forward until it squeezes against the top
of your lower teeth Now say cup

LIZA C-c-c -- I cant C-Cup
PICKERING Good Splendid Miss Doolittle

HIGGINS By Jupiter she’s done it at the first shot Pickering
we shall make a duchess of her To Liza Now do you think you
could possibly say tea Not te-yee mind if you ever say beyee
ceyee deyee again you shall be dragged around the room three
times by the hair of your head Fortissimo T T T T

LIZA weeping I cant hear no difference cep that it sounds more
genteel-like when you say it

HIGGINS Well if you can hear that difference what the devil are
you crying for Pickering give her a chocolate

PICKERING No no Never mind crying a little Miss Doolittle you
are doing very well and the lessons wont hurt I promise you I
wont let him drag you round the room by your hair

HIGGINS Be off with you to Mrs Pearce and tell her about it
Think about it Try to do it by yourself and keep your tongue
well forward in your mouth instead of trying to roll it up and
swallow it Another lesson at half-past four this afternoon Away
with you

Liza still sobbing rushes from the room
Dissolve to

Mrs Higginss drawing-room in a flat on Chelsea embankment The
room has three windows looking on the river and the ceiling is
not so lofty as it would be in an older house of the same
pretension The windows are open giving access to a balcony with
flowers in pots If you stand with your face to the windows you
have the fireplace on your left and the door in the right-hand
wall close to the corner nearest the windows

Mrs Higgins was brought up on Morris and Burne Jones and her
room which is very unlike her sons room in Wimpole Street is
not crowded with furniture and little tables and nicknacks In the
middle of the room there is a big ottoman and this with the
carpet the Morris wall-papers and the Morris chintz window
curtains and brocade covers of the ottoman and its cushions
supply all the ornament and are much too handsome to be hidden by
odds and ends of useless things A few good oil-paintings from the
exhibitions in the Grosvenor Gallery thirty years ago (the Burne
Jones not the Whistler side of them) are on the walls The only
landscape is a Cecil Lawson on the scale of a Rubens There is a
portrait of Mrs Higgins as she was when she defied fashion in her
youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which when
caricatured by people who did not understand led to the
absurdities of popular estheticism in the eighteen-seventies

In the corner diagonally opposite the door Mrs Higgins now over
sixty and long past taking the trouble to dress out of the
fashion sits writing at an elegantly simple writing-table with a
bell button within reach of her hand There is a Chippendale chair
further back in the room between her and the window nearest her
side At the other side of the room further forward is an
Elizabethan chair roughly carved in the taste of Inigo Jones On
the same side a piano in a decorated case The corner between the
fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan cushioned in
Morris chintz

It is between four and five in the afternoon
The door is opened violently and Higgins enters

MRS HIGGINS dismayed Henry scolding him What are you doing
here to-day It is my at-home day you promised not to come

HIGGINS Ive picked up a girl
MRS HIGGINS Does that mean that some girl has picked you up

HIGGINS Not at all I dont mean a love affair He sits on the
settee

MRS HIGGINS What a pity
HIGGINS Why

MRS HIGGINS Well you never fall in love with anyone under
forty-five When will you discover that there are some rather
nice-looking young women about

HIGGINS Oh I cant be bothered with young women My idea of a
lovable woman is something as like you as possible I shall never
get into the way of seriously liking young women some habits lie
too deep to be changed Rising abruptly and walking about
jingling his money and his keys in his trouser pockets Besides
theyre all idiots

MRS HIGGINS Do you know what you would do if you really loved
me Henry

HIGGINS Oh bother What Marry I suppose

MRS HIGGINS No Stop fidgeting and take your hands out of your
pockets With a gesture of despair he obeys and sits down
again Thats a good boy Now tell me about the girl

HIGGINS She coming to see you

MRS HIGGINS I dont remember asking her
HIGGINS You didnt I asked her If youd known her you wouldnt
have asked her

MRS HIGGINS Indeed Why

HIGGINS Well its like this Shes a common flower girl I picked
her off the kerbstone

MRS HIGGINS And invited her to my at-home

HIGGINS rising and coming to her to coax her Oh thatll be all
right Ive taught her to speak properly and she has strict orders
as to her behavior Shes to keep to two subjects the weather and
everybodys health—Fine day and How do you do you know-and not to
let herself go on things in general That will be safe

MRS HIGGINS Safe To talk about our health about our insides
perhaps about our outsides How could you be so silly Henry

HIGGINS impatiently Well she must talk about something He
controls himself and sits down again Oh shell be all right
dont you fuss Pickering is in it with me Ive a sort of bet on
that Ill pass her off as a duchess in six months I started on
her some months ago and shes getting on like a house on fire I
shall win my bet She has a quick ear and shes been easier to
teach than my middle-class pupils because shes had to learn a
complete new language She talks English almost as you talk
French

MRS HIGGINS Thats satisfactory at all events

HIGGINS Well it is and it isnt

MRS HIGGINS What does that mean

HIGGINS You see Ive got her pronunciation all right but you
have to consider not only h o wa girl pronounces but wh at she
pronounces and thats where--

They are interrupted by the parlor-maid announcing guests

THE PARLOR-MAID Mrs and Miss Eynsford Hill She withdraws
HIGGINS Oh Lord He rises snatches his hat from the table and
makes for the door but before he reaches it his mother introduces
him

Mrs and Miss Eynsford Hill are the mother and daughter who
sheltered from the rain in Covent Garden The mother is well bred
quiet and has the habitual anxiety of straitened means The
daughter has acquired a gay air of being very much at home in

society the bravado of genteel poverty

MRS EYNSFORD HILL to Mrs Higgins How do you do They shake
hands

MISS EYNSFORD HILL How dyou do She shakes
MRS HIGGINS introducing My son Henry

MRS EYNSFORD HILL Your celebrated son I have so longed to meet
you Professor Higgins

HIGGINS glumly making no movement in her direction Delighted
He backs against the piano and bows brusquely

MISS EYNSFORD HILL going to him with confident familiarity How
do you do

HIGGINS staring at her Ive seen you before somewhere I havnt
the ghost of a notion where but Ive heard your voice Drearily

It doesnt matter Youd better sit down

MRS HIGGINS Im sorry to say that my celebrated son has no
manners You mustnt mind him

MISS EYNSFORD HILL gaily I dont She sits in the Elizabethan
chair

MRS EYNSFORD HILL a little bewildered Not at all She sits on
the ottoman between her daughter and Mrs Higgins who has turned
her chair away from the writing-table

HIGGINS Oh have I been rude I didnt mean to be

He goes to the central window through which with his back to the
company he contemplates the river and the flowers in Battersea
Park on the opposite bank as if they were a frozen desert

The parlor-maid returns ushering in Pickering

THE PARLOR-MAID Colonel Pickering She withdraws

PICKERING How do you do Mrs Higgins

MRS HIGGINS So glad youve come Do you know Mrs Eynsford Hill—
Miss Eynsford Hill Exchange of bows The Colonel brings the
Chippendale chair a little forward between Mrs Hill and Mrs
Higgins and sits down

PICKERING Has Henry told you what weve come for

HIGGINS over his shoulder We were interrupted damn it

MRS HIGGINS Oh Henry Henry really

MRS EYNSFORD HILL half rising Are we in the way

MRS HIGGINS rising and making her sit down again No no You
couldnt have come more fortunately we want you to meet a friend

of ours

HIGGINS turning hopefully Yes by George We want two or three
people Youll do as well as anybody else
The parlor-maid returns ushering Freddy
THE PARLOR-MAID Mr Eynsford Hill

HIGGINS almost audibly past endurance God of Heaven another of
them

FREDDY shaking hands with Mrs Higgins Ahdedo

MRS HIGGINS Very good of you to come Introducing Colonel
Pickering

FREDDY bowing Ahdedo

MRS HIGGINS I dont think you know my son Professor Higgins

FREDDY going to Higgins Ahdedo

HIGGINS looking at him much as if he were a pickpocket Ill take
my oath Ive met you before somewhere Where was it

FREDDY I dont think so
HIGGINS resignedly It dont matter anyhow Sit down

He shakes Freddys hand and almost slings him on the ottoman with
his face to the windows then comes round to the other side of it

HIGGINS Well here we are anyhow He sits down on the ottoman
next Mrs Eynsford Hill on her left And now what the devil are
we going to talk about until Eliza comes

MRS HIGGINS Henry you are the life and soul of the Royal
Societys soirées but really youre rather trying on more
commonplace occasions

HIGGINS Am I Very sorry Beaming suddenly I suppose I am you
know Uproariously Ha ha

THE PARLOR-MAID opening the door Miss Doolittle She
withdraws

HIGGINS rising hastily and running to Mrs Higgins Here she is
mother He stands on tiptoe and makes signs over his mothers
head to Eliza to indicate to her which lady is her hostess

Eliza who is exquisitely dressed produces an impression of such
remarkable distinction and beauty as she enters that they all
rise quite fluttered Guided by Higginss signals she comes to
Mrs Higgins with studied grace

LIZA speaking with pedantic correctness of pronunciation and
great beauty of tone How do you do Mrs Higgins She gasps
slightly in making sure of the H in Higgins but is quite
successful Mr Higgins told me I might come
MRS HIGGINS cordially Quite right Im very glad indeed to see
you

PICKERING How do you do Miss Doolittle
LIZA shaking hands with him Colonel Pickering is it not

MRS EYNSFORD HILL I feel sure we have met before Miss
Doolittle I remember your eyes

LIZA How do you do She sits down on the ottoman gracefully in
the place just left vacant by Higgins

MRS EYNSFORD HILL introducing My daughter Clara
LIZA How do you do

CLARA impulsively How do you do She sits down on the ottoman
beside Eliza devouring her with her eyes

FREDDY coming to their side of the ottoman Ive certainly had the
pleasure

MRS EYNSFORD HILL introducing My son Freddy
LIZA How do you do
Freddy bows and sits down in the Elizabethan chair infatuated

HIGGINS suddenly By George yes it all comes back to me They
stare at him Covent Garden Lamentably What a damned thing

MRS HIGGINS Henry please He is about to sit on the edge of
the table Dont sit on my writing-table youll break it

HIGGINS sulkily Sorry

He goes to the divan stumbling into the fender and over the fire-
irons on his way extricating himself with muttered imprecations
and finishing his disastrous journey by throwing himself so
impatiently on the divan that he almost breaks it Mrs Higgins
looks at him but controls herself and says nothing

A long and painful pause ensues

MRS HIGGINS at last conversationally Will it rain do you
think

LIZA The shallow depression in the west of these islands is
likely to move slowly in an easterly direction There are no
indications of any great change in the barometrical situation
FREDDY Ha ha how awfully funny

LIZA What is wrong with that young man I bet I got it right

FREDDY Killing
MRS EYNSFORD HILL Im sure I hope it wont turn cold Theres so
much influenza about It runs right through our whole family
regularly every spring

LIZA darkly My aunt died of influenza so they said
MRS EYNSFORD HILL clicks her tongue sympathetically

LIZA in the same tragic tone But its my belief they done the
old woman in

MRS HIGGINS puzzled Done her in

LIZA Y-e-e-e-es Lord love you Why should she die of influenza
She come through diphtheria right enough the year before I saw
her with my own eyes Fairly blue with it she was They all
thought she was dead but my father he kept ladling gin down her
throat til she came to so sudden that she bit the bowl off the
spoon

MRS EYNSFORD HILL startled Dear me

LIZA piling up the indictment What call would a woman with that
strength in her have to die of influenza What become of her new
straw hat that should have come to me Somebody pinched it and
what I say is them as pinched it done her in

MRS EYNSFORD HILL What does doing her in mean

HIGGINS hastily Oh thats the new small talk To do a person in
means to kill them

MRS EYNSFORD HILL to Eliza horrified You surely dont believe
that your aunt was killed

LIZA Do I not Them she lived with would have killed her for a
hat-pin let alone a hat

MRS EYNSFORD HILL But it cant have been right for your father to
pour spirits down her throat like that It might have killed her

LIZA Not her Gin was mothers milk to her Besides hed poured
so much down his own throat that he knew the good of it

MRS EYNSFORD HILL Do you mean that he drank
LIZA Drank My word Something chronic
MRS EYNSFORD HILL How dreadful for you

LIZA Not a bit It never did him no harm what I could see But
then he did not keep it up regular Cheerfully On the burst as
you might say from time to time And always more agreeable when
he had a drop in When he was out of work my mother used to give
him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until hed
drunk himself cheerful and loving-like Theres lots of women has
to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with Now
quite at her ease You see its like this If a man has a bit of
a conscience it always takes him when hes sober and then it
makes him low-spirited A drop of booze just takes that off and
makes him happy To Freddy who is in convulsions of suppressed
laughter Here what are you sniggering at

FREDDY The new small talk You do it so awfully well

LIZA If I was doing it proper what was you laughing at To
Higgins Have I said anything I oughtnt

MRS HIGGINS interposing Not at all Miss Doolittle

LIZA Well thats a mercy anyhow Expansively What I always say
is--

HIGGINS rising and looking at his watch Ahem

LIZA looking round at him taking the hint and rising Well I
must go They all rise Freddy goes to the door So pleased to
have met you Good-bye She shakes hands with Mrs Higgins
MRS HIGGINS Good-bye

LIZA Good-bye Colonel Pickering

PICKERING Good-bye Miss Doolittle They shake hands

LIZA nodding to the others Good-bye all

FREDDY opening the door for her Are you walking across the Park
Miss Doolittle If so--

LIZA Walk Not bloody likely Sensation I am going in a taxi
She goes out

Pickering gasps and sits down

FREDDY to the heavens at large Well I ask you— He gives it up
and comes to Mrs Higgins Good-bye

MRS HIGGINS shaking hands Good-bye Would you like to meet
Miss Doolittle again

FREDDY eagerly Yes I should most awfully

MRS HIGGINS Well you know my days

FREDDY Yes Thanks awfully Good-bye He goes out
MRS EYNSFORD HILL Good-bye Mr Higgins

HIGGINS Good-bye Good-bye

MRS EYNSFORD HILL to Pickering Its no use I shall never be
able to bring myself to use that word
PICKERING Dont Its not compulsory you know Youll get on quite
well without it

MRS EYNSFORD HILL Only Clara is so down on me if I am not
positively reeking with the latest slang Good-bye

PICKERING Good-bye They shake hands

MRS EYNSFORD HILL to Mrs Higgins Thank you dear for a most
exciting afternoon Good-bye She goes out

HIGGINS eagerly Well Is Eliza presentable He swoops on his
mother and drags her to the ottoman where she sits down in Lizas
place with her son on her left

Pickering returns to his chair on her right

MRS HIGGINS You silly boy of course shes not presentable Shes
a triumph of your art and of her dressmakers but if you suppose
for a moment that she doesnt give herself away in every sentence
she utters you must be perfectly cracked about her And now tell
me Colonel Pickering what is the exact state of things in

Wimpole Street

PICKERING cheerfully as if this completely changed the subject
Well I have come to live there with Henry We work together at my
Indian Dialects and we think it more convenient--

MRS HIGGINS Quite so I know all about that its an excellent
arrangement But where does this girl live

HIGGINS With us of course Where s h 0 u 1d she live

MRS HIGGINS But on what terms Is she a servant If not what is
she

PICKERING slowly I think I know what you mean Mrs Higgins

HIGGINS Well dash me if I do Ive had to work at the girl every
day for months to get her to her present pitch Besides shes
useful She knows where my things are and remembers my
appointments and so forth

MRS HIGGINS How does your housekeeper get on with her

HIGGINS Mrs Pearce Oh shes jolly glad to get so much taken off
her hands for before Eliza came she used to have to find things
and remind me of my appointments But shes got some silly bee in
her bonnet about Eliza She keeps saying You dont think sir
doesnt she Pick

PICKERING Yes thats the formula You dont think sir Thats
the end of every conversation about Eliza

HIGGINS As if I ever stop thinking about the girl and her
confounded vowels and consonants Im worn out thinking about
her and watching her lips and her teeth and her tongue not to
mention her soul which is the quaintest of the lot

MRS HIGGINS You certainly are a pretty pair of babies playing
with your live doll

HIGGINS Playing The hardest job I ever tackled make no mistake
about that mother But you have no idea how frightfully
interesting it is to take a human being and change her into a
quite different human being by creating a new speech for her Its
filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class and
soul from soul

PICKERING drawing his chair closer to Mrs Higgins and bending
over to her eagerly Yes its enormously interesting I assure
you Mrs Higgins we take Eliza very seriously Every week --

every day almost -- there is some new change Closer again We
keep records of every stage -- dozens of gramophone disks and
photographs-—

HIGGINS assailing her at the other ear Yes by George its the
most absorbing experiment I ever tackled She regularly fills our
lives up doesnt she Pick

PICKERING Were always talking Eliza
HIGGINS Teaching Eliza

PICKERING Dressing Eliza

MRS HIGGINS What

HIGGINS Inventing new Elizas

Higgins and Pickering speaking together

HIGGINS You know she has the most extraordinary quickness of
ear

PICKERING I assure you my dear Mrs Higgins that girl

HIGGINS just like a parrot Ive tried her with every

PICKERING is a genius She can play the piano quite beautifully
HIGGINS possible sort of sound that a human being can make--
PICKERING We have taken her to classical concerts and to music
HIGGINS Continental dialects African dialects Hottentot
PICKERING halls and its all the same to her she plays
everything

HIGGINS clicks things it took me years to get hold of and
PICKERING she hears right off when she comes home whether its
HIGGINS she picks them up like a shot right away as if she had
PICKERING Beethoven and Brahms or Lehar and Lionel Monckton
HIGGINS been at it all her life

PICKERING though six months ago shed never as much as touched a
piano--

MRS HIGGINS putting her fingers in her ears as they are by this
time shouting one another down with an intolerable noise Sh-sh-
sh-sh They stop
PICKERING I beg your pardon He draws his chair back
apologetically

HIGGINS Sorry When Pickering starts shouting nobody can get a
word in edgeways

MRS HIGGINS Be quiet Henry Colonel Pickering dont you realize
that when Eliza walked into Wimpole Street something walked in
with her

PICKERING Her father did But Henry soon got rid of him

MRS HIGGINS It would have been more to the point if her mother
had But as her mother didnt something else did

PICKERING But what
MRS HIGGINS unconsciously dating herself by the word A problem

PICKERING Oh I see The problem of how to pass her off as a
lady

HIGGINS Ill solve that problem Ive half solved it already

MRS HIGGINS No you two infinitely stupid male creatures the
problem of what is to be done with her afterwards

HIGGINS I dont see anything in that She can go her own way with
all the advantages I have given her

MRS HIGGINS The advantages of that poor woman who was here just
now The manners and habits that disqualify a fine lady from

earning her own living without giving her a fine ladys income Is
that what you mean

PICKERING indulgently being rather bored Oh that will be all
right Mrs Higgins He rises to go

HIGGINS rising also Well find her some light employment
PICKERING Shes happy enough Dont you worry about her Good-bye
He shakes hands as if he were consoling a frightened child and

makes for the door

HIGGINS Anyhow theres no good bothering now The things done
Good-bye mother He kisses her and follows Pickering

PICKERING turning for a final consolation There are plenty of
openings Well do whats right Good-bye

HIGGINS to Pickering as they go out together Lets take her to
the Shakespear exhibition at Earls Court

PICKERING Yes lets Her remarks will be delicious

HIGGINS Shell mimic all the people for us when we get home
PICKERING Ripping Both are heard laughing as they go
downstairs

MRS HIGGINS rises with an impatient bounce and returns to her
work at the writing-table She sweeps a litter of disarranged
papers out of her way snatches a sheet of paper from her
stationery case and tries resolutely to write At the third line
she gives it up flings down her pen grips the table angrily and
exclaims Oh men men men

Dissolve to

The street before an embassy in London one summer evening after
dark The hall door has an awning and a carpet across the sidewalk
to the kerb because a grand reception is in progress A small
crowd is lined up to see the guests arrive

A Rolls-Royce car drives up Pickering in evening dress with
medals and orders alights and hands out Liza in opera cloak
evening dress diamonds fan flowers and all accessories Higgins
follows The car drives off and the three go up the steps and
into the house the door opening for them as they approach

Inside the house A spacious hall from which the grand staircase
rises One the left are the arrangements for the gentlemen’s
cloaks The male guests are depositing their hats and wraps there

On the right is a door leading to the ladies’ cloakroom Ladies
are going in cloaked and going out in splendor Pickering whispers
to Liza and points out the ladies’ room She goes into it
Higgins and Pickering take off their overcoats and take tickets
for them from the attendant

One of the guests occupied in the same way has his back turned
Having taken his ticket he turns round and reveals himself as an
important looking young man with an astonishingly hairy face He
has an enormous moustache flowing out into luxuriant whiskers
Waves of hair cluster on his brow His hair is cropped closely at
the back and glows with oil Otherwise he is very smart He wears
several worthless orders He is evidently a foreigner guessable
as a whiskered Pandour from Hungary but in spite of the ferocity
of his moustache he is amiable and genially voluble

Recognizing Higgins he flings his arms wide apart and approaches
him enthusiastically

WHISKERS Maestro maestro He embraces Higgins and kisses him on
both cheeks You remember me

HIGGINS No I dont Who the devil are you

WHISKERS I am your pupil your first pupil your best and
greatest pupil I am little Nepommuck the marvellous boy I have
made your name famous throughout Europe You teach me phonetic
You cannot forget ME
HIGGINS Why dont you shave

NEPOMMUCK I have not your imposing appearance your chin your
brow Nobody notice me when I shave Now I am famous they call me
Hairy Faced Dick

HIGGINS And what are you doing here among all these swells

NEPOMMUCK I am interpreter I speak 32 languages I am
indispensable at these international parties You are great
cockney specialist you place a man anywhere in London the moment
he open his mouth I place any man in Europe

A footman hurries down the great staircase and comes to Nepommuck

FOOTMAN You are wanted upstairs Her Excellency cannot understand
the Greek gentleman

NEPOMMUCK Thank you yes immediately
The footman goes and is lost in the crowd

NEPOMMUCK to Higgins This Greek diplomatist pretends he cannot
speak or understand English He cannot deceive me He is the son
of a Clerkenwell watchmaker He speaks English so villainously
that he dare not utter a word of it without betraying his origin
I help him to pretend but I make him pay through the nose I make
them all pay Ha Ha He hurries upstairs

PICKERING Is this fellow really an expert Can he find out Eliza
and blackmail her

HIGGINS We shall see If he finds her out I lose my bet

Liza comes from the cloakroom and joins them
PICKERING Well Eliza now for it Are you ready
LIZA Are you nervous Colonel

PICKERING Frightfully I feel exactly as I felt before my first
battle It’s the first time that frightens

LIZA It’s not the first time for me Colonel I have done this
fifty times -- hundreds of times -- in my little piggery in Angel
Court in my day-dreams I am in a dream now Promise me not to let
Professor Higgins wake me for if he does I shall forget
everything and talk as I used to in Drury Lane

PICKERING Not a word Higgins To Liza Now ready

LIZA Ready

PICKERING Go

They mount the stairs Higgins last Pickering whispers to the
footman on the first landing
FIRST LANDING FOOTMAN Miss Doolittle Colonel Pickering
Professor Higgins

SECOND LANDING FOOTMAN Miss Doolittle Colonel Pickering
Professor Higgins

At the top of the staircase the Ambassador and his wife with
Nepommuck at her elbow are receiving

HOSTESS taking Liza’s hand How d’ye do
HOST same play How d’ye do How d’ye do Pickering

LIZA with a beautiful gravity that awes her hostess How do you
do She passes on to the drawingroom

HOSTESS Is that your adopted daughter Pickering She will make a
sensation

PICKERING Most kind of you to invite her for me He passes on
HOSTESS to Nepommuck Find out all about her
NEPOMMUCK bowing Excellency -- he goes into the crowd

HOST How d’ye do Higgins You have a rival here tonight He
introduced himself as your pupil Is he any good

HIGGINS He can learn a language in a fortnight -- knows dozens of
them A sure mark of a fool As a phonetician no good whatever

HOSTESS How d’ye do Professor

HIGGINS How do you do Fearful bore for you this sort of thing
Forgive my part in it He passes on

e drawing room and its suite of salons The reception is in full
wing Liza passes through She is so intent on her ordeal that

e walks like a somnambulist in a desert instead of a debutante

n a fashionable crowd They stop talking to look at her admiring
er dress her jewels and her strangely attractive self Some of

e younger ones at her back stand on their chairs to see

trons”

The Host and Hostess come in from the staircase and mingle with
their guests Higgins gloomy and contemptuous of the whole
business comes into the group where they are all chatting

HOSTESS Ah here is Professor Higgins he will tell us Tell us
about the wonderful young lady Professor

HIGGINS almost morosely What wonderful young lady

HOSTESS You know very well They tell me there has been nothing
like her in London since people stood on their chairs to look at
Mrs Langtry
Nepommuck joins the group full of news

HOSTESS Ah here you are at last Nepommuck Have you found out
all about the Doolittle lady

NEPOMMUCK I have found out all about her She is a fraud
HOSTESS A fraud Oh no

NEPOMMUCK YES yes She cannot deceive me Her name cannot be
Doolittle

HIGGINS Why

NEPOMMUCK Because Doolittle is an English name And she is not
English

HOSTESS Oh nonsense She speaks English perfectly

NEPOMMUCK Too perfectly Can you shew me any English woman who
speaks English as it should be spoken Only foreigners who have
been taught to speak it speak it well

HOSTESS She certainly terrified me by the way she said How d’ye
do I had a schoolmistress who talked like that and I was
mortally afraid of her But if she is not English what is she
NEPOMMUCK Hungarian

ALL THE REST Hungarian

NEPOMMUCK Hungarian And of royal blood I am Hungarian My blood
is royal

HIGGINS Did you speak to her in Hungarian

NEPOMMUCK I did She was very clever She said “Please speak to
me in English I do not understand French” French She pretends
not to know the difference between Hungarian and French
Impossible she knows both

HIGGINS And the royal blood How did you find that out
NEPOMMUCK Instinct maestro instinct Only the Magyar races can
produce that air of the divine right those resolute eyes She is
a princess

HOST What do you say Professor

HIGGINS I say an ordinary London girl out of the gutter and
taught to speak by an expert I place her in Drury Lane

NEPOMMUCK Ha ha ha Oh maestro maestro you are mad on the
subject of cockney dialects The London gutter is the whole world

for you

HIGGINS to the Hostess What does your Excellency say
HOSTESS Oh of course I agree with Nepommuck She must be a
princess at least

HOST Not necessarily legitimate of course Morganistic perhaps
But that is undoubtedly her class

HIGGINS I stick to my opinion
HOSTESS Oh you are incorrigible

The group breaks up leaving Higgins isolated Pickering joins
him

PICKERING Where is Eliza We must keep an eye on her
Liza joins them

LIZA I dont think I can bear much more The people all stare so
at me An old lady has just told me that I speak exactly like
Queen Victoria I am sorry if I have lost your bet I have done my
best but nothing can make me the same as these people

PICKERING You have not lost it my dear You have won it ten
times over

HIGGINS Let us get out of this I have had enough of chattering
to these fools

PICKERING Eliza is tired and I am hungry Let us clear out and
have supper somewhere

The scene fades as the three make for the stairs
Fade into

The Wimpole Street laboratory Midnight Nobody in the room The
clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve The fire is not alight
it is a summer night

Presently Higgins and Pickering are heard on the stars

HIGGINS calling down to Pickering I say Pick lock up will
you I shant be going out again

PICKERING Right Can Mrs Pearce go to bed We dont want anything
more do we

HIGGINS Lord no

Liza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera
cloak brilliant evening dress and diamonds with fan flowers
and all accessories She comes to the hearth and switches on the
electric lights there She is tired her pallor contrasts strongly
with her dark eyes and hair and her expression is almost tragic
She takes off her cloak puts her fan and flowers on the piano
and sits down on the bench brooding and silent Higgins in
evening dress with overcoat and hat comes in carrying a smoking
jacket which he has picked up downstairs He takes off the hat and
overcoat throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand disposes
of his coat in the same way puts on the smoking jacket and
throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at the hearth
Pickering similarly attired comes in He also takes off his hat
and overcoat and is about to throw them on Higginss when he
hesitates

PICKERING I say Mrs Pearce will row if we leave these things
lying about in the drawing-room

HIGGINS Oh chuck them over the bannisters into the hall Shell

find them there in the morning and put them away all right Shell
think we were drunk

PICKERING We are slightly Are there any letters

HIGGINS I didnt look Pickering takes the overcoats and hats and
goes down stairs Higgins begins half singing half yawning an air

from La Fanciulla del Golden West Suddenly he stops and exclaims
I wonder where the devil my slippers are

Liza looks at him darkly then rises suddenly and leaves the room

Higgins yawns again and resumes his song

Pickering returns with the contents of the letter-box in his
hand

PICKERING Only circulars and this coroneted billet-doux for you
He throws the circulars into the fender and posts himself on the
hearthrug with his back to the grate

HIGGINS glancing at the billet-doux Money-lender He throws the
letter after the circulars

Liza returns with a pair of large down-at-heel slippers She
places them on the carpet before Higgins and sits as before
without a word

HIGGINS yawning again Oh Lord What an evening What a crew
What a silly tomfoolery He raises his shoe to unlace it and
catches sight of the slippers He stops unlacing and looks at them
as if they had appeared there of their own accord Oh theyre
there are they

PICKERING stretching himself Well I feel a bit tired Its been
a long day The garden party a dinner party and the opera
Rather too much of a good thing But youve won your bet Higgins
Eliza did the trick and something to spare eh

HIGGINS fervently Thank God its over

Liza flinches violently but they take no notice of her and she
recovers herself and sits stonily as before
PICKERING Were you nervous at the garden party I was Eliza
didnt seem a bit nervous

HIGGINS Oh she wasnt nervous I knew shed be all right No
its the strain of putting the job through all these months that
has told on me It was interesting enough at first while we were
at the phonetics but after that I got deadly sick of it If I
hadnt backed myself to do it I should have chucked the whole thing
up two months ago It was a silly notion the whole thing has been
a bore

PICKERING Oh come the garden party was frightfully exciting My
heart began beating like anything

HIGGINS Yes for the first three minutes But when I saw we were
going to win hands down I felt like a bear in a cage hanging
about doing nothing The dinner was worse sitting gorging there
for over an hour with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable
woman to talk to I tell you Pickering never again for me No
more artificial duchesses The whole thing has been simple
purgatory

PICKERING Youve never been broken in properly to the social
routine Strolling over to the piano I rather enjoy dipping into
it occasionally myself it makes me feel young again Anyhow it
was a great success an immense success I was quite frightened
once or twice because Eliza was doing it so well You see lots of
the real people cant do it at all theyre such fools that they
think style comes by nature to people in their position and so
they never learn Theres always something professional about doing
a thing superlatively well

HIGGINS Yes thats what drives me mad the silly people dont know
their own silly business Rising However its over and done
with and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow

Lizas beauty becomes murderous

PICKERING I think I shall turn in too Still its been a great
occasion a triumph for you Good-night He goes

HIGGINS following him Good-night Over his shoulder at the
door Put out the lights Eliza and tell Mrs Pearce not to make
coffee for me in the morning Ill take tea He goes out

Liza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises
and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights By the
time she gets there she is on the point of screaming She sits
down in Higginss chair and holds on hard to the arms Finally she
gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging

HIGGINS in despairing wrath outside What the devil have I done
with my slippers He appears at the door

LIZA snatching up the slippers and hurling them at him one after
the other with all her force There are your slippers And there
Take your slippers and may you never have a days luck with them
HIGGINS astounded What on earth-- He comes to her Whats the
matter Get up He pulls her up Anything wrong

LIZA breathless Nothing wrong -- with y o u Ive won your bet
for you havnt I Thats enough for you I dont matter I suppose

HIGGINS Y o u won my bet You Presumptuous insect I won it
What did you throw those slippers at me for

LIZA Because I wanted to smash your face Id like to kill you
you selfish brute Why didnt you leave me where you picked me out
of-—in the gutter You thank God its all over and that now you
can throw me back again there do you She crisps her fingers
frantically

HIGGINS looking at her in cool wonder The creature is nervous
after all

LIZA gives a suffocated scream of fury and instinctively darts
her nails at his face

HIGGINS catching her wrists Ah would you Claws in you cat
How dare you shew your temper to me Sit down and be quiet He

throws her roughly into the easy-chair

LIZA crushed by superior strength and weight Whats to become of
me Whats to become of me

HIGGINS How the devil do I know whats to become of you What does
it matter what becomes of you

LIZA You dont care I know you dont care You wouldnt care if I
was dead Im nothing to you -- not so much as them slippers

HIGGINS thundering T ho s e slippers

LIZA with bitter submission Those slippers I didnt think it
made any difference now

A pause Eliza hopeless and crushed Higgins a little uneasy

HIGGINS in his loftiest manner Why have you begun going on like
this May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here

LIZA No

HIGGINS Has anybody behaved badly to you Colonel Pickering Mrs
Pearce Any of the servants

LIZA No
HIGGINS I presume you dont pretend that I have treated you badly
LIZA No

HIGGINS I am glad to hear it He moderates his tone Perhaps
youre tired after the strain of the day Will you have a glass of
champagne He moves towards the door

LIZA No Recollecting her manners Thank you

HIGGINS good-humored again This has been coming on you for some
days I suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the
garden party But thats all over now He pats her kindly on the
shoulder She writhes Theres nothing more to worry about

LIZA No Nothing more for y 0 u to worry about She suddenly
rises and gets away from him by going to the piano bench where
she sits and hides her face Oh God I wish I was dead

HIGGINS staring after her in sincere surprise Why in heavens
name why Reasonably going to her Listen to me Eliza All
this irritation is purely subjective

LIZA I dont understand Im too ignorant

HIGGINS Its only imagination Low spirits and nothing else
Nobodys hurting you Nothings wrong You go to bed like a good
girl and sleep it off Have a little cry and say your prayers
that will make you comfortable

LIZA I heard y o u r prayers Thank God its all over

HIGGINS impatiently Well dont you thank God its all over Now
you are free and can do what you like

LIZA pulling herself together in desperation What am I fit for
What have you left me fit for Where am I to go What am I to do
Whats to become of me

HIGGINS enlightened but not at all impressed Oh thats whats
worrying you is it He thrusts his hands into his pockets and
walks about in his usual manner rattling the contents of his
pockets as if condescending to a trivial subject out of pure
kindness I shouldnt bother about it if I were you I should
imagine you wont have much difficulty in settling yourself
somewhere or other though I hadnt quite realized that you were
going away She looks quickly at him he does not look at her
but examines the dessert stand on the piano and decides that he
will eat an apple You might marry you know He bites a large
piece out of the apple and munches it noisily You see Eliza
all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel
Most men are the marrying sort (poor devils) and youre not bad-
looking its quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes—not now
of course because youre crying and looking as ugly as the very
devil but when youre all right and quite yourself youre what I
should call attractive That is to the people in the marrying
line you understand You go to bed and have a good nice rest and
then get up and look at yourself in the glass and you wont feel
so cheap

Liza again looks at him speechless and does not stir
The look is quite lost on him he eats his apple with a dreamy
expression of happiness as it is quite a good one

HIGGINS a genial afterthought occurring to him I daresay my
mother could find some chap or other who would do very well

LIZA We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road
HIGGINS waking up What do you mean

LIZA I sold flowers I didnt sell myself Now youve made a lady
of me Im not fit to sell anything else I wish youd left me where
you found me

HIGGINS slinging the core of the apple decisively into the
grate Tosh Eliza Dont you insult human relations by dragging
all this cant about buying and selling into it You neednt marry
the fellow if you dont like him

LIZA What else am I to do

HIGGINS Oh lots of things What about your old idea of a
florists shop Pickering could set you up in one hes lots of
money Chuckling Hell have to pay for all those togs you have
been wearing today and that with the hire of the jewellery will
make a big hole in two hundred pounds Why six months ago you
would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your
own Come youll be all right I must clear off to bed Im
devilish sleepy By the way I came down for something I forget
what it was

LIZA Your slippers

HIGGINS Oh yes of course You shied them at me He picks them
up and is going out when she rises and speaks to him

LIZA Before you go sir--

HIGGINS dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him
Sir Eh

LIZA Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering
HIGGINS coming back into the room as if her question were the
very climax of unreason What the devil use would they be to

Pickering

LIZA He might want them for the next girl you pick up to
experiment on

HIGGINS shocked and hurt Is t h a t the way you feel towards us

LIZA I dont want to hear anything more about that All I want to
know is whether anything belongs to me My own clothes were burnt

HIGGINS But what does it matter Why need you start bothering
about that in the middle of the night
LIZA I want to know what I may take away with me I dont want to
be accused of stealing

HIGGINS now deeply wounded Stealing You shouldnt have said
that Eliza That shews a want of feeling

LIZA Im sorry Im only a common ignorant girl and in my
station I have to be careful There cant be any feelings between
the like of you and the like of me Please will you tell me what
belongs to me and what doesnt

HIGGINS very sulky You may take the whole damned houseful if you
like Except the jewels Theyre hired Will that satisfy you He
turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon

LIZA drinking in his emotion like nectar and nagging him to
provoke a further supply Stop please She takes off her
jewels Will you take these to your room and keep them safe I
dont want to run the risk of their being missing

HIGGINS furious Hand them over She puts them into his hands
If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler Id ram them
down your ungrateful throat He perfunctorily thrusts them into
his pockets unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding
ends of the chains

LIZA taking a ring off This ring isnt the jewelers its the
one you bought me in Brighton I dont want it now Higgins dashes
the ring violently into the fireplace and turns on her so
threateningly that she crouches over the piano with her hands over
her face and exclaims Dont you hit me

HIGGINS Hit you You infamous creature how dare you accuse me of
such a thing It is you who have hit me You have wounded me to
the heart

LIZA thrilling with hidden joy Im glad Ive got a little of my
own back anyhow

HIGGINS with dignity in his finest professional style You have
caused me to lose my temper a thing that has hardly ever happened
to me before I prefer to say nothing more tonight I am going to
bed

LIZA pertly Youd better leave a note for Mrs Pearce about the
coffee for she wont be told by me

HIGGINS formally Damn Mrs Pearce and damn the coffee and damn
you and damn my own folly in having lavished hard-earned
knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a
heartless guttersnipe He goes out with impressive decorum and
spoils it by slamming the door savagely

Liza goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to look for the ring
When she finds it she considers for a moment what to do with it
Finally she flings it down on the dessert stand and goes upstairs
in a tearing rage
The stairs Liza going up to her room
The landing Liza goes into her room

The bedroom as before except that its furniture has been
increased by a big wardrobe and a sumptuous dressing-table

Liza comes in and switches on the electric light She goes to the
wardrobe opens it and pulls out a walking dress a hat anda
pair of shoes which she throws on the bed She takes off her
evening dress and shoes then takes a padded hanger from the
wardrobe adjusts it carefully in the evening dress and hangs it
in the wardrobe which she shuts with a slam She puts on her
walking shoes her walking dress and hat She takes her wrist-
watch from the dressing-table and fastens it on She pulls on her
gloves takes her vanity bag and looks into it to see that her
purse is there before hanging it on her wrist She makes for the
door

She takes a last look at herself in the glass

Close-up of her reflection in the glass registering fierce
resentment and determination

She suddenly puts out her tongue at herself

The bedroom She leaves the room ready equipped for going out At
the door she puts out the electric light Blackout

Exterior of the house Freddy in evening dress and overcoat is
at the railings gazing up at the second floor in which one of
the windows is still lighted

The light goes out

FREDDY Goodnight darling darling darling

The hall door steps The fanlight flares up The door opens and
Liza appears She puts out the fanlight comes out on the steps
and closes the door giving it a considerable bang behind her

At the railings closer up Liza finds Freddy there
LIZA Whatever are you doing here

FREDDY Nothing I spend most of my nights here It’s the only
place where I’m happy Dont laugh at me Miss Doolittle

LIZA Dont you call me Miss Doolittle do you hear Liza’s good
enough for me She breaks down and grabs him by the shoulders
Freddy you don’t think I’m a heartless guttersnipe do you

FREDDY Oh no no darling how can you imagine such a thing You
are the loveliest dearest--
He loses all self-control and smothers her with kisses She
hungry for comfort responds They stand there in one another’s
arms

An elderly police constable arrives

CONSTABLE scandalized Now then Now then Now then

They release one another hastily

FREDDY Sorry constable Weve only just become engaged

They run away

The constable shakes his head reflecting on his own courtship and
on the vanity of human hopes He moves off in the opposite
direction with slow professional steps

Cavendish Square

Freddy and Liza halt to consider their next move

LIZA out of breath He didnt half give me a fright that copper
But you answered him proper

FREDDY I hope I havnt taken you out of your way Where were you
going

LIZA To the river

FREDDY What for

LIZA To make a hole in it

FREDDY Eliza darling What do you mean Whats the matter

LIZA Never mind It doesnt matter now Theres nobody in the world
now but you and me is there

FREDDY Not a soul

They indulge in another embrace and are again surprised by a much
younger constable

SECOND CONSTABLE Now then you two Whats this Where do you
think you are Move along here double quick

FREDDY As you say sir Double quick They run away
Hanover Square

Liza and Freddy rush in and stop for breath

FREDDY I had no idea the police were so devilishly prudish

LIZA It’s their business to hunt girls off the streets
FREDDY We must go somewhere We cant wander about the streets all
night

LIZA Cant we I think it’d be lovely to wander about forever
FREDDY Oh darling

They embrace again oblivious of the arrival of a crawling taxi
It stops

TAXIMAN Can I drive you and the lady anywhere sir

They start asunder

LIZA Oh Freddy a taxi The very thing

FREDDY But damn it Ive no money

LIZA I have plenty The Colonel thinks you should never go out
without ten pounds in your pocket Listen We’1ll drive about all
night and in the morning I’1l call on old Mrs Higgins and ask her
what I ought to do I’1l tell you all about it in the cab And the
police wont touch us there

FREDDY Righto Ripping To the Taximan Wimbledon Common

He follows Liza into the cab They drive off

Dissolve to

Mrs Higginss drawing-room She is at her writing-table as
before The parlor-maid comes in

THE PARLOR-MAID at the door Mr Henry maam is downstairs with
Colonel Pickering

MRS HIGGINS Well shew them up

THE PARLOR-MAID Mr Henrys in a state maam I thought Id
better tell you

MRS HIGGINS If you had told me that Mr Henry was not in a state
it would have been more surprising Go upstairs and tell Miss
Doolittle that Mr Henry and the Colonel are here Ask her not to
come down till I send for her

THE PARLOR-MAID Yes maam

Higgins bursts in He is as the parlor-maid has said in a state

HIGGINS Look here mother heres a confounded thing

MRS HIGGINS Yes dear Good-morning He checks his impatience
and kisses her whilst the parlor-maid goes out What is it

HIGGINS Elizas bolted
MRS HIGGINS calmly continuing her writing You must have
frightened her

HIGGINS Frightened her nonsense She was left last night as
usual to turn out the lights and all that and instead of going
to bed she changed her clothes and went right off her bed wasnt
slept in She came in a cab for her things before seven this
morning and that fool Mrs Pearce let her have them without
telling me a word about it What am I to do

MRS HIGGINS Do without Im afraid Henry The girl has a
perfect right to leave if she chooses

HIGGINS wandering distractedly across the room But I cant find

anything I dont know what appointments Ive got Im-- Pickering
comes in Mrs Higgins puts down her pen and turns away from the

writing-table

PICKERING shaking hands Good-morning Mrs Higgins Has Henry
told you

The parlor-maid comes in and breaks off the conversation

THE PARLOR-MAID Mr Henry a gentleman wants to see you very
particular Hes been sent on from Wimpole Street

HIGGINS Oh bother I cant see anyone now Who is it

THE PARLOR-MAID A Mr Doolittle sir

PICKERING Doolittle Do you mean the dustman

THE PARLOR-MAID Dustman Oh no sir a gentleman

HIGGINS springing up excitedly By George Pick its some
relative of hers that shes gone to Somebody we know nothing
about To the parlor-maid Send him up quick

THE PARLOR-MAID Yes sir She goes

HIGGINS eagerly going to his mother Genteel relatives now we
shall hear something He sits down in the Chippendale chair

MRS HIGGINS Do you know any of her people
PICKERING Only her father the fellow we told you about
THE PARLOR-MAID announcing Mr Doolittle She withdraws

Doolittle enters He is resplendently dressed as for a fashionable
wedding and might in fact be the bridegroom A flower in his
buttonhole a dazzling silk hat and patent leather shoes complete
the effect He is too concerned with the business he has come on
to notice Mrs Higgins He walks straight to Higgins and accosts
him with vehement reproach

DOOLITTLE indicating his own person See here Do you see this Y
o u done this
HIGGINS Done what man

DOOLITTLE This I tell you Look at it Look at this hat Look at
this coat

PICKERING Has Eliza been buying you clothes
DOOLITTLE Eliza not she Not half Why would she buy me clothes
MRS HIGGINS Good-morning Mr Doolittle Wont you sit down

DOOLITTLE taken aback as he becomes conscious that he has
forgotten his hostess Asking your pardon maam He approaches
her and shakes her proffered hand Thank you He sits down on
the ottoman on Pickerings right I am that full of what has
happened to me that I cant think of anything else

HIGGINS What the dickens h a s happened to you

DOOLITTLE I shouldnt mind if it had only happened to me
anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame but
Providence as you might say But this is something that you
done to me yes y o u Henry Higgins

HIGGINS Have you found Eliza Thats the point
DOOLITTLE Have you lost her
HIGGINS Yes

DOOLITTLE You have all the luck you have I aint found her but
shell find me quick enough now after what you done to me

MRS HIGGINS But what has my son done to you Mr Doolittle

DOOLITTLE Done to me Ruined me Destroyed my happiness Tied me
up and delivered me into the hands of middle class morality

HIGGINS rising intolerantly and standing over Doolittle Youre
raving Youre drunk Youre mad I gave you five pounds After that
I had two conversations with you at half-a-crown an hour Ive
never seen you since

DOOLITTLE Oh Drunk am I Mad am I Tell me this Did you or

did you not write a letter to an old blighter in America that was
giving five millions to found Moral Reform Societies all over the
world and that wanted you to invent a universal language for him

HIGGINS What Ezra D Wannafeller Hes dead He sits down again
carelessly

DOOLITTLE Yes hes dead and Im done for Now did you or did you
not write a letter to him to say that the most original moralist
at present in England to the best of your knowledge was Alfred
Doolittle a common dustman
HIGGINS Oh after your last visit I remember making some silly
joke of the kind

DOOLITTLE Ah you may well call it a silly joke It put the lid
on me right enough Just give him the chance he wanted to shew
that Americans is not like us that they recognize and respect
merit in every class of life however humble Them words is in his
blooming will in which Henry Higgins thanks to your silly
joking he leaves me a share in his Predigested Cheese Trust worth
three thousand a year on condition that I lecture for his
Wannafeller Moral Reform World League as often as they ask me up
to six times a year

HIGGINS The devil he does Whew Brightening suddenly What a
lark

PICKERING A safe thing for you Doolittle They wont ask you
twice

DOOLITTLE It aint the lecturing I mind Ill lecture them blue in
the face I will and not turn a hair Its making a gentleman of
me that I object to Who asked him to make a gentleman of me I
was happy I was free I touched pretty nigh everybody for money
when I wanted it same as I touched you Enry Iggins Now I am
worrited tied neck and heels and everybody touches me for money
Its a fine thing for you says my solicitor Is it says I You
mean its a good thing for you I says When I was a poor man and
had a solicitor once when they found a pram in the dust cart he
got me off and got shut of me and got me shut of him as quick as
he could Same with the doctors used to shove me out of the
hospital before I could hardly stand on my legs and nothing to
pay Now they finds out that Im not a healthy man and cant live
unless they looks after me twice a day In the house Im not let
do a hands turn for myself somebody else must do it and touch me
for it A year ago I hadnt a relative in the world except two or
three that wouldnt speak to me Now Ive fifty and not a decent
weeks wages among the lot of them I have to live for others and
not for myself thats middle class morality You talk of losing
Eliza Dont you be anxious I bet shes on my doorstep by this she
that could support herself easy by selling flowers if I wasnt
respectable And the next one to touch me will be you Henry
Higgins Ill have to learn to speak middle class language from
you instead of speaking proper English Thats where youll come
in and I daresay thats what you done it for

MRS HIGGINS I think this solves the problem of Elizas future
You can provide for her now

HIGGINS jumping up Nonsense he cant provide for her He shant
provide for her She doesnt belong to him I paid him five pounds

for her Doolittle either youre an honest man or a rogue

DOOLITTLE tolerantly A little of both Henry like the rest of
us a little of both

HIGGINS Well you took that money for the girl and you have no
right to take her as well

MRS HIGGINS Henry dont be absurd If you really want to know
where Eliza is she is upstairs

HIGGINS amazed Upstairs Then I shall jolly soon fetch her
downstairs He makes resolutely for the door

MRS HIGGINS rising and following him Be quiet Henry Sit down
HIGGINS I--

MRS HIGGINS Sit down dear and listen to me

HIGGINS Oh very well very well very well He throws himself
ungraciously on the ottoman with his face towards the windows

But I think you might have told me this half an hour ago

MRS HIGGINS Eliza came to me this morning She told me of the
brutal way you two treated her

HIGGINS bounding up again What
PICKERING rising also My dear Mrs Higgins shes been telling
you stories We didnt treat her brutally We hardly said a word to

her and we parted on particularly good terms

HIGGINS We said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to
go to bed Did we Pick

PICKERING shrugging his shoulders That was all

MRS HIGGINS ironically Quite sure
PICKERING Absolutely Really that was all

MRS HIGGINS You didnt thank her or pet her or admire her or
tell her how splendid shed been

HIGGINS impatiently But she knew all about that We didnt make
speeches to her if thats what you mean

PICKERING conscience stricken Perhaps we were a little
inconsiderate Is she very angry

MRS HIGGINS returning to her place at the writing-table Well
Im afraid she wont go back to Wimpole Street especially now that
Mr Doolittle is able to keep up the position you have thrust on
her but she says she is quite willing to meet you on friendly
terms and to let bygones be bygones

HIGGINS furious Is she by George Ho
MRS HIGGINS If you promise to behave yourself Henry Ill ask

her to come down If not go home for you have taken up quite
enough of my time
HIGGINS Oh all right Very well Pick you behave yourself Let
us put on our best Sunday manners for this creature that we picked
out of the mud He flings himself sulkily into the Elizabethan
chair

MRS HIGGINS Remember your promise Henry She presses the bell-
button on the writing-table Mr Doolittle will you be so good
as to step out on the balcony for a moment I dont want Eliza to
have the shock of your news until she has made it up with these
two gentlemen Would you mind

DOOLITTLE As you wish lady Anything to help Henry to keep her
off my hands He disappears through the window

The parlor-maid answers the bell Pickering sits down in
Doolittles place

MRS HIGGINS Ask Miss Doolittle to come down please

THE PARLOR-MAID Yes maam She goes out

MRS HIGGINS Now Henry be good

HIGGINS I am behaving myself perfectly

PICKERING He is doing his best Mrs Higgins

Liza enters sunny self-possessed and giving a staggeringly
convincing exhibition of ease of manner She carries a little
work-basket and is very much at home Pickering is too much taken
aback to rise

LIZA How do you do Professor Higgins Are you quite well
HIGGINS choking Am I-- He can say no more

LIZA But of course you are you are never ill So glad to see you
again Colonel Pickering He rises hastily and they shake
hands Quite chilly this morning isnt it She sits down on his
left He sits beside her
HIGGINS Dont you dare try this game on me I taught it to you
and it doesnt take me in Get up and come home and dont be a

fool

Liza takes a piece of needlework from her basket and begins to
stitch at it without taking the least notice of this outburst

MRS HIGGINS Very nicely put indeed Henry No woman could
resist such an invitation

HIGGINS You let her alone mother Let her speak for herself You
will jolly soon see whether she has an idea that I havnt put into
her head or a word that I havnt put into her mouth I tell you I
have created this thing out of the squashed cabbage leaves of
Covent Garden and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me
MRS HIGGINS placidly Yes dear but youll sit down wont you
Higgins sits down again savagely

LIZA to Pickering taking no apparent notice of Higgins and
working away deftly Will you drop me altogether now that the
experiment is over Colonel Pickering

PICKERING Oh dont You mustnt think of it as an experiment It
shocks me somehow

LIZA Oh Im only a squashed cabbage leaf--
PICKERING impulsively No

LIZA continuing quietly -- but I owe so much to you that I
should be very unhappy if you forgot me

PICKERING Its very kind of you to say so Miss Doolittle

LIZA Its not because you paid for my dresses I know you are
generous to everybody with money But it was from you that I
learnt really nice manners and that is what makes one a lady
isnt it You see it was so very difficult for me with the example
of Professor Higgins always before me I was brought up to be just
like him unable to control myself and using bad language on the
slightest provocation And I should never have known that ladies
and gentlemen didnt behave like that if you hadnt been there

HIGGINS Well
PICKERING Oh thats only his way you know He doesnt mean it

LIZA Oh I didnt mean it either when I was a flower girl It was
only my way But you see I did it and thats what makes the
difference after all

PICKERING No doubt Still he taught you to speak and I couldnt
have done that you know

LIZA trivially Of course that is his profession
HIGGINS Damnation

LIZA continuing It was just like learning to dance in the
fashionable way there was nothing more than that in it But do
you know what began my real education

PICKERING What

LIZA stopping her work for a moment Your calling me Miss
Doolittle that day when I first came to Wimpole Street That was
the beginning of self-respect for me She resumes her stitching
And there were a hundred little things you never noticed because
they came naturally to you Things about standing up and taking
off your hat and opening door--
PICKERING Oh that was nothing

LIZA Yes things that shewed you thought and felt about me as if
I were something better than a scullery-maid though of course I
know you would have been just the same to a scullery-maid if she
had been let in the drawing-room You never took off your boots in
the dining room when I was there

PICKERING You mustnt mind that Higgins takes off his boots all
over the place

LIZA I know I am not blaming him It is his way isnt it But it
made such a difference to me that you didnt do it You see really
and truly apart from the things anyone can pick up (the dressing
and the proper way of speaking and so on) the difference between
a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how shes
treated I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins
because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will but
I know I can be a lady to you because you always treat me as a
lady and always will

MRS HIGGINS Please dont grind your teeth Henry
PICKERING Well this is really very nice of you Miss Doolittle

LIZA I should like you to call me Eliza now if you would

PICKERING Thank you Eliza of course

LIZA And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss
Doolittle

HIGGINS Ill see you damned first
MRS HIGGINS Henry Henry

PICKERING Youre coming back to Wimpole Street arnt you Youll
forgive Higgins

HIGGINS rising Forgive Will she by George Let her go Let her
find out how she can get on without us She will relapse into the
gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow

Doolittle appears at the centre window With a look of dignified
reproach at Higgins he comes slowly and silently to his daughter
who with her back to the window is unconscious of his approach

PICKERING Hes incorrigible Eliza You wont relapse will you

LIZA No Not now Never again I have learnt my lesson I dont
believe I could utter one of the old sounds if I tried Doolittle
touches her on her left shoulder She drops her work losing her
self-possession utterly at the spectacle of her fathers splendor
A-a-a-a-a-ah-ow-ooh

HIGGINS with a crow of triumph Aha Just so A-a-a-a-ahowooh A-
a-a-a-ahowooh A-a-a-a-ahowooh Victory Victory He throws
himself on the divan folding his arms and spraddling
arrogantly

DOOLITTLE Can you blame the girl Dont look at me like that
Eliza It aint my fault Ive come into some money

LIZA You must have touched a millionaire this time dad

DOOLITTLE I have But Im dressed something special today Im
going to St Georges Hanover Square Your stepmother is going to
marry me

LIZA angrily Youre going to let yourself down to marry that low
common woman

PICKERING quietly He ought to Eliza To Doolittle Why has she
changed her mind

DOOLITTLE sadly Intimidated Governor Intimidated Middle class
morality claims its victim Wont you put on your hat Liza and
come and see me turned off

LIZA If the Colonel says I must I-Ill almost sobbing Ill
demean myself And get insulted for my pains like enough

DOOLITTLE Dont be afraid she never comes to words with anyone
now poor woman respectability has broke all the spirit out of
her

PICKERING squeezing Elizas elbow gently Be kind to them Eliza
Make the best of it

LIZA forcing a little smile for him through her vexation Oh
well just to shew theres no ill feeling Ill be back ina
moment She goes out

DOOLITTLE sitting down beside Pickering I feel uncommon nervous
about the ceremony Colonel I wish youd come and see me through
it

PICKERING But youve been through it before man You were married
to Elizas mother

DOOLITTLE Who told you that Colonel

PICKERING Well nobody told me But I concluded -- naturally --
DOOLITTLE No that aint the natural way Colonel its only the
middle class way My way was always the undeserving way But dont
say nothing to Eliza She dont know I always had a delicacy about
telling her

PICKERING Quite right Well leave it so if you dont mind

DOOLITTLE And youll come to the church Colonel and put me
through straight
PICKERING With pleasure As far as a bachelor can

MRS HIGGINS May I come Mr Doolittle I should be very sorry to
miss your wedding

DOOLITTLE I should indeed be honored by your condescension maam
and my poor old woman would take it as a tremenjous compliment
Shes been very low thinking of the happy days that are no more

MRS HIGGINS rising Ill order the car and get ready The men
rise except Higgins I shant be more than fifteen minutes As
she goes to the door Eliza comes in hatted and buttoning her
gloves Im going to the church to see your father married
Eliza You had better come with me Colonel Pickering can go on
with the bridegroom

Mrs Higgins goes out Eliza comes to the middle of the room
between the centre window and the ottoman Pickering joins her

DOOLITTLE Bridegroom What a word It makes a man realize his
position somehow He takes up his hat and goes towards the
door

PICKERING Before I go Eliza do forgive him and come back to us
LIZA I dont think papa would allow me Would you dad

DOOLITTLE sad but magnanimous They played you off very cunning
Eliza them two sportsmen If it had been only one of them you
could have nailed him But you see there was two and one of them
chaperoned the other as you might say To Pickering It was
artful of you Colonel but I bear no malice I should have done
the same myself I been the victim of one woman after another all
my life and I dont grudge you two getting the better of Eliza I
shant interfere Its time for us to go Colonel So long Henry
See you in St Georges Eliza He goes out

PICKERING coaxing Do stay with us Eliza He follows
Doolittle

Liza goes out on the balcony to avoid being alone with Higgins He
rises and joins her there She immediately comes back into the
room and makes for the door but he goes along the balcony quickly
and gets his back to the door before she reaches it

HIGGINS Well Eliza youve had a bit of your own back as you
call it Have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable

Or do you want any more

LIZA You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up
with your tempers and fetch and carry for you

HIGGINS I havnt said I wanted you back at all
LIZA Oh indeed Then what are we talking about

HIGGINS About you not about me If you come back I shall treat
you just as I have always treated you I cant change my nature
and I dont intend to change my manners My manners are exactly the
same as Colonel Pickerings

LIZA Thats not true He treats a flower girl as if she was a
duchess

HIGGINS And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl The
question is not whether I treat you rudely but whether you ever
heard me treat anyone else better

LIZA with sudden sincerity I dont care how you treat me I dont
mind your swearing at me I dont mind a black eye Ive had one
before this But standing up and facing him I wont be passed
over

HIGGINS Then get out of my way for I wont stop for you You talk
about me as if I were a motor bus

LIZA So you are a motor bus all bounce and go and no
consideration for anyone I cant talk to you you turn everything
against me Im always in the wrong But you know very well all
the time that youre nothing but a bully You know I cant go back
to the gutter as you call it and that I have no real friends in
the world but you and the Colonel You know well I couldnt bear to
live with a low common man after you two and its wicked and
cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could You think I must
go back to Wimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but
fathers But dont you be too sure that you have me under your
feet to be trampled on and talked down Ill marry Freddy I will
as soon as I’m able to support him

HIGGINS thunderstruck Freddy that young fool That poor devil
who couldnt get a job as an errand boy even if he had the guts to
try for it Woman do you not understand that I have made you
consort for a king

LIZA Freddy loves me that makes him king enough for me I dont
want him to work he wasnt brought up to it as I was Ill go and
be a teacher

HIGGINS Whatll you teach in heavens name

LIZA What you taught me Ill teach phonetics

HIGGINS Ha Ha Ha

LIZA Ill offer myself as an assistant to that hairy-faced
Hungarian

HIGGINS rising in a fury What That blackmailer that humbug
that toadying ignoramus Teach him my methods my discoveries You
take one step in his direction and Ill wring your neck He lays
hands on her Do you hear

LIZA defiantly non-resistant Wring away What do I care I knew
youd strike me some day He lets her go stamping with rage at
having forgotten himself and recoils so hastily that he stumbles
back into his seat on the ottoman Aha Now I know how to deal
with you What a fool I was not to think of it before You cant
take away the knowledge you gave me You said I had a finer ear
than you And I can be civil and kind to people which is more
than you can Aha Purposely dropping her aitches to annoy him
Thats done you Enry Iggins it has Now I dont care that
snapping her fingers for your bullying and your big talk Ill
advertize it in the papers that your duchess is only a flower girl
that you taught and that shell teach anybody to be a duchess
just the same in six months for a thousand guineas Oh when I
think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and
called names when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to
be as good as you I could just kick myself

HIGGINS wondering at her You damned impudent slut you But by
George Eliza I said Id make a woman of you and I have I like
you like this

LIZA Yes you turn round and make up to me now that Im not
afraid of you and can do without you

HIGGINS Of course I do you little fool Five minutes ago you
were like a millstone round my neck Now youre a tower of
strength a consort battleship

Mrs Higgins returns dressed for the wedding Eliza instantly
becomes cool and elegant

MRS HIGGINS The car is waiting Eliza Are you ready
LIZA Quite Is the Professor coming

MRS HIGGINS Certainly not He cant behave himself in church He
makes remarks out loud all the time on the clergymans
pronunciation

LIZA Then I shall not see you again Professor Good bye She
goes to the door

MRS HIGGINS coming to Higgins Good-bye dear

HIGGINS Good-bye mother He is about to kiss her when he
recollects something Oh by the way Eliza order a ham and a
Stilton cheese will you And buy me a pair of reindeer gloves
number eights and a tie to match that new suit of mine at Eale and
Binmans You can choose the color His cheerful careless
vigorous voice shows that he is incorrigible

LIZA disdainfully Number eights are too small for you if you
want them lined with lamb’s wool You have three new ties you have
forgotten in the drawer of your washstand Colonel Pickering
prefers double Gloucester to Stilton and you dont notice the
difference I telephoned Mrs Pearce this morning not to forget the
ham What you are to do without me I cannot imagine She sweeps
out
MRS HIGGINS Really neither can I

HIGGINS Oh she’1l come home to Wimpole Street all right enough
But fancy her wanting to marry that young idiot Freddy Can you
understand it

MRS HIGGINS Perfectly After Eliza’s six months slavery with you
Freddy is just the sort of boy any girl would want to marry But
how is the poor lad to keep her He has no profession

HIGGINS Pickering and I will have to keep them both He can clean
our boots I suppose

MRS HIGGINS I dont believe he knows how to clean his own boots
poor lad

HIGGINS Well he can make love to her I dont do that sort of
thing and Pickering’s too old

MRS HIGGINS Did she say anything to you about setting up as a
teacher

HIGGINS grimly She did

MRS HIGGINS What did you say

HIGGINS I wrung her neck

MRS HIGGINS Henry

HIGGINS I did Freddy cant wring her neck he’s not big enough
MRS HIGGINS Henry you dont know it and cant help it but you
are a terrible elocutionary bully Thats why Eliza wants the

kindly little baby man whom she can bully

HIGGINS Anyhow he takes that part of the job off our hands The
motor horn squawks impatiently Thats for you Theyre waiting

MRS HIGGINS Oh bother Goodbye dear expecting a kiss
HIGGINS I am going down with you

He opens the door for her and they go out together

Cut to

Mrs Higgin’s limousine standing opposite her garden gate in Cheyne
Walk Inside the car are Liza and Freddy looking out for Mrs

Higgins

Higgins and his mother come out He is overcoated and hatted
exactly as in the first scene in Covent Garden

Liza disappears into the back of the limousine to allow Freddy to
alight and open the door for Mrs Higgins
HIGGINS staring at Freddy Hallo What the devil are y o u doing
here

FREDDY Miss Doolittle invited me

MRS HIGGINS How do you do Mr Hill I think you may call her
Eliza now She gets into the car

FREDDY still holding the car door open Coming Professor
LIZA No he is not coming Get in quick We are late

FREDDY By the way Professor thanks awfully for promising to set
us up in a flower shop Her old dream you know A lady in a
flower shop We are most grateful

LIZA Sh-sh-sh Freddy I havnt asked him yet

She pulls him into the car Liza slams the door of the limousine
which drives off leaving Higgins on the pavement stranded and
amazed

HIGGINS A squashed cabbage leaf A lady in a flower shop
Dissolve to

A vision of the past

Covent Garden a vision of the portico viewed from the market

Liza crouching over her basket and looking her dirtiest and most
wretched Higgins along looking at her

LIZA Poor girl Hard enough for her to live without being worried
and chivied Ought to be ashamed of himself unmanly coward Let
him mind his own business and leave a poor girl alone

The old music from the church Higgins takes his hat off The
scene fades out and is replaced by

A vision of the future

A florist’s shop in South Kensington full of fashionable
customers Liza behind the counter serving in great splendor The
name of the shopkeeper F HILL is visible Half the shop is
stocked with vegetables Freddy in apron and mild muttonchop
whiskers is serving Dreamlike silence Fade out into

Mrs Higgins’s garden gate in Cheyne Walk

Higgins standing rapt A policewoman comes along She stops and
looks curiously at Higgins who is quite unconscious of her and
visibly rapt

POLICEWOMAN Anything wrong sir

HIGGINS waking up What
POLICEWOMAN Anything wrong sir

HIGGINS impressively No nothing wrong A happy ending A

beginning Good morning madam
POLICEWOMAN impressed Good morning sir

Higgins raises his hat and stalks away majestically The
policewoman stands at attention and salutes

THE END
