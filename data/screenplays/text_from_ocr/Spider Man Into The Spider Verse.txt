There could be a universe where I
am wearing red Or wearing leather
pants--

The door BURSTS OPEN -- MILES out of breath is silhouetted
in the doorway

The TEACHER FLIPS THE LIGHTS on STUDENTS blink in the bright
light and grumble

MS CALLEROS
Mr Morales moving in the dark
You’re late again

MILES
Einstein said time was relative
right Maybe I’m not late Maybe
you guys are early

Miles’ joke is met with unamused SILENCE Except for a single
TITTER from a NEW GIRL

NEW GIRL
Sorry It was just so quiet

MS CALLEROS
Would you like to keep standing
there or do you want to sit down

Someone HITS THE LIGHTS In the dark Miles awkwardly makes
his way to his seat BANGS into a desk in the dark

Onscreen is a PHYSICIST identified as “Director Alchemax
Laboratories” She’s the consummate nerd and AMPED about

physics

PHYSICIST
Our universe is in fact one of many
parallel universes happening at the
exact same time Thanks to everyone
here at the Fisk Family Foundation
for the Sciences I will prove they
exist when I build my
supercollider All I need is 10
billion dollars Chump change
right

ON MILES he BONKS INTO THE DESK of a NEW GIRL paying rapt
attention and sits down at the desk beside her

Miles checks out the girl who catches him looking Miles
looks away Looks back -- she’s still looking

NEW GIRL
I liked your joke

MILES
Really

NEW GIRL
I mean it wasn’t funny that’s why
I laughed But it was smart so I
liked it

MILES
(taken aback then)
I don’t think I’ve seen you before--

--Ms Calleros SHUSHES Miles cutting him off

MS CALLEROS
Shhhhh

Miles sits -- checks out the new girl but she’s again
focussed on the documentary Miles is INTRIGUED

PHYSICIST
Every choice that we make would
create countless other
possibilities A What-if to
infinity

INT VISIONS ACADEMY CLASSROOM - LATER

Miles stands in front of Ms Calleros’ desk as she slides a
zero with a 0100 written on it

MILES
A zero A few more of those and you
probably have to kick me outta here
huh Maybe I’m just not right for
this school

MS CALLEROS
If a person wearing a blind fold
picked the answers on a true or
false quiz at random do you know
what score they would get

MILES
Fifty percent

MS CALLEROS
That’s right

MILES

Wait wait

MS CALLEROS
The only way to get all the answers
wrong is to know which answers
were right You’re trying to quit
And I’m not going to let you I’m
assigning you a personal essay Not
about physics but about you and
what kind of person you want to be

Miles’ spider-sense continues to direct him

Another surge of SPIDER-SENSE hits Miles and we hear
competing thoughts in his head

MILES (VO)
Slow downWhat am I doing What am

Miles picks up the pace jogs around the corner where Miles
TURNS a BIG SURGE OF SPIDER-SENSE and multiple voices are
heard together--

MILES

--You’re like me--

GREEN GOBLIN
Why won’t you quit

SPIDER-MAN
I don’t know I guess I like
Brooklyn not being sucked into a
black hole

MILES

SPIDER-MAN
Staten Island maybe NOT Brooklyn

As Miles turns to run A GIANT BEAM CRASHES INTO THE ROOM
Miles FALLS ON TOP OF IT as it swings back out into the room
where Goblin and Spider-Man are FIGHTING Miles hangs onto
the beam for dear life

MILES
No no

Miles is tossed around the room as Goblin and Spider-Man
battle

Green Goblin throws CLUSTER BOMBS as Spider-man swings around
them and Miles avoids the explosion but now hes EXPOSED
This is WAY more real in person

He runs down a MASSIVE HALLWAY away from the battle Miles

catches himself before tumbling over the end of the hallway
into a giant room

are on an OBSERVATION LEDGE overlooking the collider chamber

A beat as they appraise each other Then

SPIDER-MAN

Did you know your shoes are untied
MILES

Uh huh
SPIDER-MAN

This is a onesie so I don’t really
have to worry about it

A beat Spidey senses something in Miles Their spider-senses

--IN AN AMAZING MIND-BOGGLING MOVE Spidey jumps away and
uses the MASSIVE CHURNING SUPERCOLLIDER to WHIP HIMSELF UP
until he’s ON THE CEILING hundreds of yards above and eye-
level with a CEILING PANEL

MILES (VO)
How does he do that

He RIPS THE PANEL OUT reaches in pulling out COMPLICATED
WIRING He pulls a STRANGE COMPUTERIZED KEY out of his suit
and tries to plug it INTO A HANGING PORT Miles watches
IMPRESSED

Spider-Man tries to put the key in the port but it’s the
wrong side he flips it around that’s wrong too somehow

I always get this wrong

As he finally gets it-- a SURGE OF SPIDER-SENSE--

on his cell phone

His giant blue tongue lashes around angrily hitting Spider-

(Peter is quiet)
Like a parallel universe where
things are like this universe but
different And youre Spider-Man in
that universe But somehow traveled
to this universe but you don’t
know how

PETER
Wow That was really just a guess
MILES
Well we learned about it in
physics
PETER
--Quantum theory
MILES
(realizing)

This is amazing You can teach me
just like Peter said he would--

PETER
--Before he died

MILES
Yeah exactly

PETER
Yeah alright

MILES
Look I made a promise to him
PETER
Here’s lesson number one kid
Dont watch the mouth Watch the

hands

Peter holds up his UNTIED hands Miles is flabbergasted
Peter stands up

Before Miles can react Peter leaps kicks-spins the punching
bag toward Miles knocking him over HARD

MILES
Peter seriously--

--Peter WEBS HIS MOUTH SHUT
Peter BOUNDS to the window Turns back feeling guilty
PETER
Trust me kid thisll all make you
a better Spider-Man
Peter LEAPS FROM THE WINDOW--
--but his powers GLITCH he FALLS We hear him SCREAM then

hit the fire escape

SEQ 1750 - TEAMING UP “TEU”

EXT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

MILES
Hey are you okay

PETER
No I’m not

MILES
What’s going on with your body

PETER

I don’t think my atoms are real
jazzed about being in the wrong
dimension

(glitches)
Look I’m not looking for a side
gig as a Spider-Man coach I got a
lot going on in my dimension like
a lot

MILES
With great power comes great--

PETER
Don’t you dare finish that sentence-
- don’t do it I’m sick of it
(glitches )
Want my advice Go back to being a
regular kid--

MILES
I don’t have a choice Kingpin’s
got a supercollider He’s trying to
kill me

PETER
Wait a second what did you just
say

MILES
Kingpin’s trying to kill me

PETER
Who cares about that Where’s the
collider

MILES
Brooklyn Under Fisk Tower

PETER
Goodbye

Peter starts WALKING DOWN THE BUILDING Miles sttuggles to
FOLLOW (Note rest of scene staged like a classic NYC movie
“walk and talk” but IT’S VERTICALand one of the
participants HASNT LEARNED TO WALK YET)

MILES
Where are you going

PETER
When it runs again Ill just jump
in and get back to my life--

MILES
--You can’t let them run it I’m
supposed to destroy it so it never
runs again or everyone’s gonna die--

PETER
(mocking)
--Or everyone’s going to die That
is what they always say
(MORE )

PETER (CONTD)
But there’s always a little bit of
time before everybody dies and
that’s when I do my best work

MILES
Aren’t you going to need this

Miles produces the goober

PETER
Ah you have a goober Give it

Peter reaches out Miles holds it back

MILES
(holding it back)
Wait no Not so fast He called it
an override key

PETER
There’s always a bypass key a
virus key a who-cares key I can
never remember so I just call ita
goober Give it

MILES
I need it to destroy the collider

PETER
I need it to go home

Miles puts it in his mouth

MILES
(mouth full)
No I’1l swallow it don’t play
with me

PETER
What

Peter starts to walk again knowing he’1l provoke a response
MILES
(mouth full)
I said--

Without even looking at Miles Peter nonchalantly webs the
goober right out of Miles mouth

MILES (CONT’D)
Hey

PETER
The collider created a portal that
brought me here And I have to g--
(realizing)
Did you break this

MILES
No it broke I don’t remember
what happened

PETER
This is why I never had kids this
is why I never did that

MILES
Can’t we make another one

PETER
No we can’t do anything Thanks to
you I have to re-steal what your
guy stole from Alchemax and make
another one of these

MILES
Look if I don’t turn off the
collider after you leave everyone
in this city my parents my uncle
and millions of others will die
and you’re just gonna go home and
leave me here to figure this out
for myself You good with that
Spider-Man

PETER
Yeah

Peter walks away over the top of the building and disappears
from sight

Miles utterly defeated sits down on the wall With his head
in his hands

Peter peeks his head back over the ledge Not so far below
the surface is the guy who used to care but

PETER (CONTD)
What are you doing

MILES
Making you feel guilty Is it
working

PETER
How could it no-- Look at me does
it look like it’s working No
it’s no it’s ohhhh
(screaming into his
jacket)
Ahhh No No Do not let him win

Miles raises his head up to see Peter walk back towards him
PETER (CONTD)
Alright kid you win
(then)
C’mon we don’t have a second to
lose

Miles smiles

EXTINT GREEK DINER - EARLY MORNING
--MATCH CUT Miles’ face annoyed

Peter STUFFS HIS FACE while Miles watches This is not a
normal Spider-Man

PETER

I love this burger So delicious
One of the best burgers I’ve ever
had In my universe this place
closed six years ago I don’t know
why I really don’t

(the check arrives)
You have money right I’m not very
liquid right now

MILES
Can we focus

PETER
Uh huh sure

MILES
The other Peter--

PETER
(reaching for Miles’
burger)
You gonna eat that I’m listening

MILES
The other Peter said he was going
to be showing me the ropes

PETER
Wow

MILES
You got any Spider-Man tips you can
tell me now

PETER
Yeah I got plenty Disinfect the
mask You’re gonna want to use baby
powder in the suit heavy on the
joints You don’t want any chafing

right
MILES
Anything else
PETER
Nope that was everything
MILES
I think you’re going to be a bad
teacher
PETER

Mhmm Look up where Alchemax is

MILES
(reads from his phone)
A private technological campus in
Hudson Valley New York
(excited)
You can teach me to swing on the
way there

Peter LAUGHS

SEQ 2140 - HITCHING A RIDE “HAR”

TIME CUT -- Peter and Miles ride a bus through the Hudson
Valley

PETER
I’m not swinging to the Hudson
Valley Miles Not after a hearty
burger-breakfast Keep your legs

EXT ALCHEMAX LABS - DAY

UNZIP SHORTS DOWN MASKS ON THEY SUIT UP Reveal Miles
wearing a YELLOW CAPE with his Spidey-suit

PETER
And it’s a no on the cape

MILES
I think it’s cool

Peter grabs the cape Miles grabs it A bit of a tug of war

PETER
Take that off it’s disrespectful
Spider-Man doesn’t wear a cape

Finally Peter yanks the cape from Miles

Miles and Peter lie at the edge of the woods SCOPING IT OUT
Beautiful Zaha Hadid style buildings a dream campus
Peppered amongst are THUGGISH GUYS in lab coats

MILES
So how do we retrace Peter’s steps

PETER
That’s a good question What
would I do if I were me
(thinks for a second)
Got it Step One I infiltrate the
lab

We QUICKLY see MULTI-PANEL IMAGES of the mission going off
without a hitch -- and with Miles barely appearing

PETER (CONTD)
Two Find the head scientists
computer-—

MILES INTERRUPTS HIS IMAGE OF A CLASSIC SCIENTIST

MILES
That lady with the bike is the head
scientist I saw her in this
documentary at school

PETER
Cool Step Three I re-examine my
personal biases Step Four I hack
the computer--

--Miles POPS into the multi-panel image of Peter downloading

the override code from the scientist’s computer--

MILES
--It’s not technically hacking
It’s kinda--

PETER

(shoves him out)
--Not now hold on I just lost my
train of thought Step Five
download the important stuff I’1l
know it when I see it and Step
Six I grab a bagel from the
cafeteria and run

BACK LIVE

MILES
So what am I doing

PETER
--uh Step 7 You stay here you’re
lookout Very important

Miles reacts

MILES
Look man you have to teach me to
do Spider-Man stuff or I’m not
going to be able to help--

PETER
(stretching)
Alright
(swinging away)
Watch and learn kid I’1l quiz you
later

--Then he’s gone stealthily swinging across the clearing
toward the ALCHEMAX BUILDING where Peter crawls down to a
GRATE opens it and ENTERS Now Miles is ALONE IN THE WOODS

MILES
(so mad)
Why did I get stuck with the janky-
old broke hobo Spider-Man

Miles PUNCHES the rock and cracks it

MILES (CONTD)
That’s new

Suddenly a LIMO PULLS UP TO THE BUILDING and who should step
out but KINGPIN flanked by Tombstone he walks into
Alchemax Miles FREEZES

MILES (CONTD)
Kingpin

He hides behind the rock thinking What does he do What
does he do What does he do

--HARD CUT to Miles running across a field towards Alchemax
MILES (VO) (CONT’D)
What am I doing What am I doing
What am I doing What am I doing

Miles looks over the side of the building as KINGPIN and
TOMBSTONE enter

He AWKWARDLY ENTERS THE OPEN GRATE into--

SEQ 2350 - IN THE VENTS “ITV”

INT ALCHEMAX LABS - VENT

Miles crawls through He follows Kingpin with Tombstone
marching through the halls below Kingpin blocks light from
below as he walks

MILES
(whispering)
Peter Peter--

Miles isn’t looking where he’s going so he fails to notice
the LARGE BUTT ahead CRASHING INTO IT--

MILES (CONT’D)
Peter

PETER
Yeah what are you doing here

MILES
Kingpin’s here Just move over

--Miles tries to worm up next to Peter Miles and Peter
complain like two brothers sharing a sleeping bag

PETER
C’mon Youre stepping on my foot

MILES
Move a little to your right--

PETER
Go back outside

MILES
No I can’t sit there and just let
Spider-Man die without doing
anything about it I’m not doing
that again

Peter reacts Softens

MILES (CONTD)
What

PETER
(thinks it over)
Most people I meet in the workplace
try to kill me so you’re a nice
change of pace

HEAD SCIENTIST (0S)
Uh Mr Fisk

BELOW THE VENTS the Head Scientist leads Kingpin to a
computer-—

HEAD SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
--Look at this data I know you
can’t really understand it but
these are really good numbers--

INT LAB - CONTINUOUS
She goes to the computer and enters her password

PETER
And I got the password

HEAD SCIENTIST

(shows photos of cluster

poles and busses etc)
Uh Mr Fiske If we fire again this
week there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn You see this And
this This is multiple dimensions
beginning to crash into each other

VENTS Miles and Peter listen Miles growing very nervous
Peter noticing

PETER
(reassuring)
--This is pretty standard Spider-
Man stakes you get used to it
Watch this he’s going to say
‘youve got 24 hours’

KINGPIN
Youve got twenty-four hours

HEAD SCIENTIST
What this means is that there could
be a rupture in the space time
continuum

PETER
Oooh that’s bad Actually
everything she said was bad I was
lying before

--The group below is EXITING As they do Peter SPRINGS INTO
ACTION--

--Peter climbs out of the air vent and smoothly crawls upside
down along a ceiling duct and jumps down He starts hacking
into the scientist’s computer He hears her off-screen
talking to Fisk

HEAD SCIENTIST (0S)
OK hold on let me show you some
more data--

Peter looks back sees Miles out of the vent

PETER
What’re you doing bud

Miles exerts himself trying to unstick He shakes his head

MILES
I can’t move

PETER
OK relax your fingers We don’t
have time Just “let go” be in the
moment

MILES
--I am in the moment it’s a
terrible moment--

CUT OUTSIDE TO Kingpin and the Head Scientist

HEAD SCIENTIST
I’m not refusing--

KINGPIN
No more excuses

HEAD SCIENTIST
--I just need more time

CUT BACK INSIDE TO MILES

PETER
They’re right there they’re going
to see you Miles you gotta
unstick What do you do to relax

MILES
Relax Okay

Beat Miles begins to sing his song from the opening

PETER
Oh for crying out loud

Miles starts humming to himself He unsticks a finger Then
another Starts to move his hands

--The rest of MILES’ fingers come unstuck and Miles starts to
FALL Miles and the metal duct CRASH TO THE GROUND with a
huge CLANG

PETER (CONT’D)
Teenagers just the worst--

SEQ 2400 - ALCHEMAX LABS “ACL”

INT LAB - CONTINUOUS

Peter’s spider-sense motivates him to look at the door’s
window through which he sees the Head Scientist TURN BACK TO
HER OFFICE having heard the crash

PETER
--Miles Where did you go

He’s nowhere to be seen But we can hear him They continue
to WHISPER-YELL

MILES
(invisible)
Im right here

PETER
Where I can’t see you

MILES
(invisible)
I’m right in front of you Can
Spider-Man turn invisible

PETER
Not in my universe

MILES
Ow You just poked me in my eye

PETER
(marveling)
This is incredible-- some kind of
fight or flight thing

MILES
What’s that

The Head Scientist WALKS TOWARD HER OFFICE to INVESTIGATE--
Peter turns suddenly in a PANIC--

PETER
--Remember this password
Dgfampesand435876534545435--

MILES
Slow down Peter I-- I need to
write it down

PETER MILES (CONTD)
(smoothes hair under --How do I do that--
mask)

--and download the schematic--

PETER
--While I turn on the charm

The Head Scientist walks into her office to see Spider-Man
STANDING “CASUALLY” with his arm on her desk and a METAL DUCT
dented in the MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR

HEAD SCIENTIST
Spider-Man

PETER
Oh hey Didnt see you there

HEAD SCIENTIST
Wow Okay I’m kinda freaking out
right now I mean youre supposed
to be dead

PETER
Surprise--

The Head Scientist suddenly pulls up Spideys mask--

PETER (CONT’D)
Whoa--OK thats a no-no we don’t
like that--

--revealing Peters face

ON THE HEAD SCIENTIST she GASPS She quickly appraises him
up and down now LASER FOCUSSED--

HEAD SCIENTIST
This is fascinating

She snaps on a latex glove and grabs Peter’s face

PETER
--OK that’s m’face--

HEAD SCIENTIST
An entirely different Peter Parker

The Head Scientist BENDS DOWN to poke Peter’s STOMACH Behind
her we see semi-visible Miles running around confused
Peter’s eyes WIDEN -- he’s gonna be caught

HEAD SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
OK a little bit of a gut perhaps
from dimensional warping

PETER
Oh yeah yeah yeah I was way
flatter before I warped

Miles ARRIVES AT THE COMPUTER and frantically plugs in his
DRIVE typing the password Dgfampesand4then

HEAD SCIENTIST (0S)
(to herself)
Travel through the multiverse
appears to have deteriorated

ON MILESTHE SCREEN

MILES
(to himself)
3454543 Ah what was the rest

Miles pauses unsure of the rest Peter WHISTLES

The Head Scientist LOOKS UP AT PETER IN RESPONSE a little
SUSPICIOUS--

PETER
(covering)
--How old are you You don’t look a
day over 35

Miles types the 35 It WORKS But then a BAFFLING DESKTOP
FULL OF FILES appears

MILES
(to himself)
Organize your desktop lady

As Peter FRANTICALLY CLOCKS MILES while trying to not be
obvious -- The scientist shoves Peter into a chair hard--

HEAD SCIENTIST
This might pinch a little

--Mechanical RESTRAINTS strap Peter to the chair

PETER
Ow Ow ow

She grabs a TOOL Advances
HEAD SCIENTIST
I know I just need to get these
samples

She jams a tongue depressor in Peter’s mouth

PETER
Yeah ok

The Head Scientist studies a sample on a slide
HEAD SCIENTIST
Wow Just complete cellular decay
I’ve never seen anything like this
Peter sees a MONITOR AND COMPUTER FLOATING IN THE AIR
PETER

(whispers )
What are you doing

MILES
(whispers )
I’m just taking the whole thing

The Head Scientist turns to look at Peter

HEAD SCIENTIST
And obviously youve been
glitching

PETER
(glitching)
Glitching No Why would you even
say that

HEAD SCIENTIST
If you stay in this dimension too
long your body’s going to
disintegrate Do you know how
painful that would be Peter
Parker

PETER
Uh I don’t know

HEAD SCIENTIST
You can’t imagine
(weirdly intense)
And I for one can’t wait to
watch

PETER
(long beat)
What did you say your name was

HEAD SCIENTIST
Doctor Olivia Octavius

OH NO She takes off her blue glasses and puts on red
goggles Her TENTACLES UNFURL One TENTACLE grabs Peter by
the neck and slams him into the wall Ladies and gentlemen
meet this dimensions DOCTOR OCTOPUS

PETER
Can I assume that your friends call
you Doc Ock

HEAD SCIENTIST
My friends actually call me Liv
(then turning)
My enemies call me Doc Ock

Peter shoots a web towards the door control panel opening
the door for Miles to escape through

PETER
I got this Run

DOC OCK
Who are you talking to

Miles looks down the empty hallway but hesitates leaving
Peter behind

PETER DOC OCK (CONTD)
I got it Oh you got it Peter

Miles takes off down the hallway Peter is repeatedly SLAMMED
into the glass walls as Miles runs by him--

PETER
--I got it handled buddy
Everything is fine

The ALARM BLARES with RED ALERT LIGHTING--

MILES runs terrified carrying the computer Flashing
between visible and invisible like a human strobe light So
Many emotions swirling his powers can’t tap into just one--He
RUNS INTO A LAB ASSISTANT turning VISIBLE--

MILES LAB ASSISTANT
DAAAAAAAAHHHHHH DAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

PETER (FLIES BY IN BACKGROUND)
Okay this is a little bit bad

DOC OCK (0OS)
Oh you’re chatty

The Lab Assistant leaps up freaked -- she sure looks like
GWANDA IN A LAB COAT

Peter and Doc Ock continue fighting through offices and
laboratories It’s well let’s let Peter tell us

PETER
--And this is the moment that I’m
losing the fight

--BOOM PETER SMASHES through the WALL and lands next to
Miles Peter WINCES IN PAIN

Miles holds up the computer and monitor shrugs

PETER (CONT’D)
Alright let me tell you the good
news We don’t need the monitor

Peter grabs the monitor throws it----Peter is already
SWINGING OUT THE DOOR Miles is SHOCKED--

--Then THROUGH THE DUST we see the ICONIC 4 METALLIC ARMED
SILHOUETTE of DOC OCK She EMERGES towering above

DOC OCK
Peter You didn’t tell me you had
an invisible friend Could you give
me that back young man

MILES
--Peter--

DOC OCK

Her ARM extends to Miles when Peter swings Miles out the

Peter YANKS HIM THROUGH THE DOOR shooting ANOTHER WEB to
CLOSE THE DOOR in OCK’S FACE Nice going Peter

Alright you ready

MILES
Of course I’m not ready
EXT HUDSON FOREST - CONTINUOUS

Peter SWINGS INTO THE TREES but Miles is FROZEN He’s never

Miles is a disaster -- TWISTING and FLAILING on his web as
GUNFIRE explodes branches and tree trunks around him

MILES
Whoa whoa I can’t do this yet

PETER
Everybody knows that the best way
to learn is under intense life-
threatening pressure

Miles fumbles with his web shooter

MILES
Cmon c’mon

But he MISSES TUMBLING to the ground Guards find him and
start SHOOTING

MILES (CONTD)
Uh oh

Miles SPRINTS along the forest floor as Peter swings above
him

PETER
What are you doing down there

MILES
I run better than I swing

PETER
You gotta swing or they’1l catch
you This is what you wanted

Miles hears a BUZZSAW Doc Ock appears CUTTING DOWN TREES
with her mechanical arms

PETER (CONT’D)
Uh oh

Miles tries to find purchase with his web shooter but he
keeps missing

Come back little boy

Peter doubles back yelling advice back at Miles

PETER
Aim with your hips Look where you
want it to hit Square your
shoulders

PETER (CONTD)
Don’t forget to follow through
Don’t shoot off your back foot

Miles runs up a tree -- he’s out of runway
MILES
That’s too many things
PETER
Then stop listening to me
MILES
That’s the best idea youve had all

day

Miles leaps off the tree shoots off a web and It CONNECTS
He swings away as Peter knocks down Doc Ock

PETER
Nice Miles

Miles swings onto a branch and swings alongside Peter

MILES
I’m doing it

PETER

Miles crashes onto the branch grabbing the computer by it’s
power cord However the BRANCH BREAKS causing both to fall
down which allows Ock to grab the computer -- Theyre done

stay and do it for him

Then venom strike me right now or
turn invisible on command so you

seem even more right

Yeah yeah right

Peter looks down and hesitates HE’S SCARED TO GO--

They’re both hit with a surge of SPIDER-SENSE Miles and
Peter look down to see Kingpin has left the observation room
and is now leap-frogging his way across buildings towards
them

KINGPIN
You’re not going ANYWHERE

Peter assesses the situation
PETER

Peter jumps away from the panel going towards Kingpin Miles
is SURPRISED

MILES
Peter that wasn’t the deal

let Spider-Man die

MILES
(defiant)
Neither can I

PETER

Miles DROP KICKS Peter and holds him suspended over the
portal It looks exactly like when Peter challenged Miles in
his dorm room before tying him up

MILES (CONTD)
(with empathy)
You gotta go home man

PETER
(suddenly sad and scared)
How do I know I’m not gonna mess it
up again

MILES
You won’t

PETER
(realizing)
Right It’s a leap of faith

Peter takes his hand off Miles hand readying himself Miles
DROPS Peter into the portal

Peter smiles as he disappears into the portal

PETER (CONTD)
Not bad kid

Miles pulls his mask back down and turns to face the
approaching Kingpin THEY FACE OFF

MILES
Kingpin

Kingpin SMASHES the building causing a ripple of glass to
fly towards Miles Miles backflips out of the way

Kingpin pulls out a gun and Miles WEBS it away

MILES (CONTD)
Nope Sorry That’s cheating

He starts to advance when a subway train suddenly speeds by
heading towards the panel Miles shoots a web at the train
and hitches a ride

MILES (CONTD)
Adios

punches But Kingpin predicts Miles’ next spot and lands a
hit

Miles tries to venom strike but it fizzles out

MILES
Oh no

KINGPIN
Not so easy doing it on your own is

Kingpin grabs Miles around the neck and slams him against the
wall

KINGPIN (CONTD)
I can’t wait to kill one more

Kingpin reacts and runs after them dropping Miles He enters
the train car and finds it empty his family has gone back
into the multiverse

EXT SUBWAY TRAIN

Miles climbs out of one of the windows and onto the side of
the speeding train He looks around and locates the panel He
is about to web away when Kingpin BURSTS through the side of
the train and lands in front of Miles He’s LOST EVERYTHING
but he’s not losing the fight

KINGPIN
Youre not stopping this Not

MILES

I am stopping this Right now
IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

Jefferson walks in and examines the control room It’s
trashed as a result of the interdimensional event going on
He looks out the front of the room and witnesses the chaos
taking place in the collider room

The train car whizzes by with Kingpin and Miles fighting on
top of it in clear view of Jefferson

JEFFERSON
(into his walkie)

He only hears static
IN THE COLLIDER ROOM
Kingpin and Miles fight Kingpin with renewed fury Kingpin
throws Miles off the train and they continue fighting as they
fall drowning in SienkowiczKirby Psychedelia
Kingpin and Miles CRASH into the Brooklyn Bridge
A dazed Miles shakes off the collision on the bridge his

mask off He staggers to his feet Kingpin is already
standing unsteady but still dangerous

Kingpin and Miles square off two exhausted boxers Kingpin
suddenly reaches out

He brutally shoves Miles to the ground Miles rolls away and
tries to get up He’s hurt He looks up and sees Kingpin
coming after him again Kingpin grabs Miles by the head and
slings him against a pile of debris

Miles smashes into the ground tries to get up and slips

KINGPIN
The real Spider-Man couldn’t even
beat me You’re nothing

Kingpin is out of breath but he is enjoying beating the hell
out of Miles

Miles keeps GETTING UP and Kingpin keeps KNOCKING HIM DOWN
Miles keeps getting back up he’s exhausted

KINGPIN (CONTD)
You took my family and now I’m
gonna make sure you never see yours
again

Kingpin KNOCKS MILES DOWN AGAIN and approaches to finish him
off Just then a voice is heard in the distance

JEFFERSON
Get up Spider-Man

Miles eyes flicker open at the sound He looks to the control
room where he sees someone moving around It’s his dad

JEFFERSON (CONT’D)
Get up C’mon C’mon

MILES
(struggling)
Cmon c’mon come on

It takes him a few wobbly seconds but Miles staggers to his
feet and faces Kingpin

MILES (CONTD)
I‘1l always have my family You
ever hear of the shoulder touch

KINGPIN
What

-Miles drops a hand toward Kingpin’s shoulder

MILES
Hey

--As he touches Kingpin on the shoulder he delivers a
GIGANTIC VENOM STRIKE--

KKAAAAAAA-ZAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

Kingpin flies back from the force of the Venom Blast Miles
webs him and swings Kingpin into the panel--

MILES (CONTD)
Hey Kingpin Push the green button
for me

-- Kingpin FLIES INTO THE PANEL a DIRECT HIT making the
Venom Blast extend to the entire collider room--

The beam starts to suck everything back in
Miles webs himself to the ceiling and holds on as the chaos
reaches a fever pitch The beam retreats back into the

collider guns causing a MASSIVE IMPLOSION

In the control room Jefferson is blown back by the force of
the implosion

THE COLLIDER SHUTS OFF The shaking stops
Miles hangs from the ceiling He did it
Some coughing catches his attention From the debris of the

observation room he sees Jefferson stand up coughing and
shaking dust off

Jefferson looks up and sees a spider web dangling but now
MILES IS GONE

Spiderman walks away

JEFFERSON
Wait what

Miles walks off shoots a web swings away

MILES AS SPIDER-MAN
And look behind you

Jefferson turns and sees that Kingpin has been strung up by
webs between two buildings and there’s a note that reads
“From your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man”
