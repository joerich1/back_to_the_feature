space And the book1ll end with me transporting myself fifteen feet
through space from one telepod to another Thats whats really missing

be asleep Suddenly Brundles hand reaches out and grabs the air Brundle
opens his eyes and his fist to see that he caught a house fly He looks
around then gets out of bed

CUT TO

Time passes and Veronica wakes up She slips on a shirt and goes into the
lab She sits down and watches as Brundle excersises on a chait He uses his
hands on the arms to lift himself up and down He then goes over to a steel
bar which stretches across part of the lab and swings back and forth on it
He appears to be very energetic and experienced at what he is doing He lifts
himself up and then swings back down onto the floor He turns around to See
Veronica who stand up and rests her hand on Brundles chest

CUT TO

TV IMAGES From time to time we cut to the live (film) version of these same
images When we are live we also see reactions from Veronica Brundle is
being interviewed in CLOSE-UP VERONICA SPEAKS OFF-CAMERA

VERONICA (OC
Weve just seen the first teleportation of a human being Dr Seth Brundle

how did it feel going through What did it feel like

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE
It feels like a stutter

VERONICA
A what

BRUNDLE
A stutter A hiccup A slight dislocation of my physical life Not
unpleasant Just a little interuption of rhythym For a second I thought it
didnt work I thought I was in the same telepod I started out in

VERONICA (OC)
And did you feel at all different

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
A littleunbalanced Thats all

VERONICA (OC)
And now

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)

I should feel exactly the same as before but I dont Im not complaining
I feel very co-ordinated And very energized I feel as though I work better
physically Everthing seems to just - work together better than it ever did
before

VERONICA (OC)
Why should that be

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
Its possible that the teleporter has somehowimproved me

VERONICA (OC)
But thats fantastic How is it possible

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)

In reassembling me it might have - this is just a guess - but it might have
just - seen where things could be improved - theoretically and it did it I
told it to be creative and I guess it has been

VERONICA (OC)
Could this ever be dangerous

BRUNDLE
Well its certainly unexpected The monkeys havent shown any change from

their norm Well see when they come back from testing

VERONICA
You still havent answered me Could this ever be dangerous

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
It feels too perfect to be dangerous

VERONICA
You like the way it feels

BRUNDLE (ON TAPE)
Yes I do (BIG SMILE) Want to try it

CUT TO
CU VERONICA live She shakes her head No

EXT THE STREETS- DAY
Brundle and Veronica walk down the busy street They stop at a small
jewellers in a market and Brundle picks out a neckelace for Veronica

INT COFFEE SHOP- DAY
Veronica and Brundle are sat opposite each other in a small coffee shop

BRUNDLE

So I asked the computer if it improved me and it said it didnt know what I
was talking about And thats made me think very carefully about what Ive
been feeling and why And Im beginning to think that the sheer process of
being taken apart atom by atom and put back together again why its like
coffee being put through a filter Its somehow a purifying process Its
purified me its cleansed me And I tell you I think its going to allow me
to realise the personal potential Ive been neglecting all these years That
Ive been obsessively pursuing goal after goal

Veronica notices that Brundle has filled his cup almost to the top with
sugar

VERONICA
Do you normally take coffee with your sugar

BRUNDLE

What Heh You know I just dont think Ive ever given me a chance to be me
But of course Interestingly and the exact same moment that I achieved what
will probably prove to be my lifes work thats the moment when I started
being the real me finally Listen not to wax messianic It may be true that
the synchronicity of those two events might blur the resultant individual
effect of either individual But it is nevertheless it is also certainly
true I will say now however subjectively that Human teleportation
molecular decimation breakdown and reformation is inherently purging It
makes a man a King From the moment I walked out of the pod I felt like a
million bucks You know I think I am gonna have a cemoli after all Waiter
I mean What an accomplishment

But what have I really done All Ive done is say to the world Lets go
Move Catch me if you can Waiter Jesus Christ

INT BRUNDLES LAB- DAY

We pan through Brundles lab to discover Brundle and Veronica making love on
the couch Veronica is half wearing a dressing gown

VERONICA
How How can you keep going You cant have have any fluid left in your
body Weve been doing this for hours

BRUNDLE
Uhhhh Im not ready to quit yet Hey come on

VERONICA
No

BRUNDLE
Come on
Veronica moves her hand down Brundles back and finds think hairs protruding
from the cuts in his back left by the computer chip

VERONICA
Whats this

BRUNDLE
Its an attempt to distract me thats what it is

VERONICA
No really what is it Its like hairs or something

BRUNDLE
I dont know Its It happens when you get older Weird hair
configurations I dont know

VERONICA
They are really coarse

BRUNCLE
Well Ive never really been hairy enough You know what I mean Always
too boyish Im looking forward to a hairy body

VERONICA
No I

BRUNDLE
Its one of the compensations of old age Come here Where are you going

VERONICA
No let me go

Veronica stands up and Wraps the dressing gown around her She stands up and
goes into the kitchen Brundle puts underwear on and gets some ice cream from
the freezer He sits down and begins eating Veronica using a pair of
scissors tried to cut the hairs from his back

BRUNDLE
Okay Hey hey hey Not my new hairs What are you doing

VERONICA
Relax Brundle I dont really think you want a body covered with these God
Theyre really tough

Suddenly Brundle drops the spoon and stands up As he talks he walks with
Ronnie towards the telepods

BRUNDLE
Listen I want you to go through I want to teleport you as soon as
possible Right now Youll feel incredible Ronnie I hardly need to sleep

anymore and I feel wonderful Its like a drug but a perfectly pure and
benign drug The power I feel surging inside me And I wont be able to wear
you out Well be the perfect couple The dynamic duo Come on right now

VERONICA
No Hey wait Dont give me that born-again teleportation rap I-I told you
Im scared to do it What more do I have to say Im not gonna do it
Veronica pulls herself away

BRUNDLE
Youre a fucking drag you know that

VERONICA
Something went wrong Seth When you went through something went wrong

BRUNDLE
No Not you If youre too chickenshit to be a member of the dynamic duo
club okay then great Ill find somebody else Somebody who can keep up
with me

VERONICA
Seth you have to listen to me

Brundle gets dressed and heads for the door

BRUNDLE

Youre afraid to dive into the plasma pool arent you Youre afraid to be

destroyed and recreated arent you Ill bet you think that you woke me up

about the flesh dont you But you only know societys straight line about

the flesh You cant penetrate beyond societys sick gray fear of the flesh
Drink deep or taste not the plasma spring You see what Im saying Im not

just talking about sex and penetration Im talking about penetration beyond
the veil of the flesh A deep penetrating dive into the plasma pool

Brundle leaves Veronica standing shocked in the lab As he walks down the
corridor he jumps up and hits a light shade

EXT THE STREETS- NIGHT

Brundle walks down the street from his pocket he pulls a chocolate bar
which he begins to eat

INT A BAR- NIGHT

BRUNDLE
The hairs Oh yeah thats a strange thing to do
VERONICA

them He finally came to the conclusion that they were definitely not
human

BRUNDLE
Oh Very good

VERONICA
Not human Seth In fact very likely insect hairs

BRUNDLE
Thats silly Thats ridiculous

VERONICA

Brundle starts punching a support beam attatched to the corner of the wall
As he punches it parts of it exlode out and buckle

VERONICA
No Stop it

BRUNDLE
Do you know any sick men who can do that Come here

Brundle pulls Veronica and throws her out of the door

VERONICA
No wait Seth please wait Seth

Brundle pulls the door shut and locks it
BRUNDLE
Dont come back

VERONICA
Oh God Oh my God

We stay with Veronica as she slowly walks down the corridor

CUT TO

Brundle enters his Bathroom and seems worried when he examines himself in the
mirror He tries to shave with an electric razor which hurts so Brundle
throws it into the bath and destroys it
He then looks back in the mirror and bites his nail which comes off
in his teeth He squeezes the end which projects a white liquid onto the
mirror He then pulls another nail off before sitting on the rim of his bath
tub

BRUNDLE
Am I dying Is this how it starts am I dying

CUT TO
Brundle is sat at his computer with a pair of gloves on

BRUNDLE
Give me a disc I need the first teleportation S Brundle

The computers shows the log of Seths first teleportation which also shows a
second object in the telepod When Brundle asks what the secondary object is
the computers replies Secondary element is Not-Brundle

BRUNDLE
Run Sequence

The computer runs through several scans of the Secondary element and it
becomes clear that it is a fly Brundle asks the computer through typing
what happened to the fly The Computer soon responds with Fusion Brundle
finally asks if he absorbed and assimilated the fly The Computer tells him
Negative Fusion of Brundle and Fly at molecular Genetic level

INT RONNIES APARTMENT- NIGHT

VERONICA
Hello

BRUNDLE
(Mumbles)

VERONICA
Seth Seth Ive been trying to reach you Where are you

BRUNDLE
For the last four weeks Ive been afraid to see you Now Im afraid not to

VERONICA
Where are you Are you at home

BRUNDLE
Veronica You dont know how right you were Ive gotten much much worse
Please come see me Please come now

INT BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
Veronica enters the Lab which appears to be empty

VERONICA
Seth Im here

Suddenly Brundle jumps out from behind the prototype telepod which is now
exposed
BRUNDLE
Stop

VERONICA
Seth

Seth Brundle now walking on Canes shows himself after a month of self
induced insolation He is much worse than when we last met him and alot of
his hair has fallen out His skin has a gray colour to it and is covered in
small lumps and spots He wears gloves

BRUNDLE

You were right Im diseased and uh it might be contagious somehow I
wouldnt want to infect you And its been accelerating Its unrelenting
Every time I look in the mirror theres someone different someone hideous
repulsive

VERONICA
What happened

BRUNDLE
I know an old lady who swallowed a fly perhaps shell die

VERONICA
Seth please

BRUNDLE
I was not pure The teleporter insists on inner purity I was not pure

VERONICA
I dont know what you mean

BRUNDLE

A fly got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when i was alone
Uh the computer got confused there werent supposed to be two separate
genetic patterns and it decided to splice us together It mated us me and
the fly We hadnt even been properly introduced My teleporter turned her
into a gene splicer And a very good one Now Im not Seth Brundle anymore
Im the offspring of um Brundle and housefly

VERONICA
Oh God

Veronica moves closer to Brundle who jumps up from his seat

BRUNDLE
No

VERONICA
Oh God

BRUNDLE
Please

VERONICA
Seth
BRUNDLE
You look so pretty

VERONICA
What will happen

Brundle sits back down in another chair

BRUNDLE
Oh I think its showing itself as a bizarre form of cancer

VERONICA
What

BRUNDLE

And general cellular chaos and revolution Im just gonna have to
disintegrate In a novel way no doubt And then Ill die And then it will
be all over

VERONICA
No no no I dont accept that There must be something we can do you know
somebody we can go to tests that can be done

BRUNDLE
No Um I wont be just another tumorous bore talking endlessly about his
hair falling out and his lost lymph nodes

VERONICA
Well then what do you want me to do Why did you call me

Brundle picks up a donut and vomits a white liquid over it Veronica utters a
small scream and puts her hand over her mouth

BRUNDLE
Oh thats disgusting

He puts the donut down and touches his ear which falls onto the floor

BRUNDLE
My ear No Im scared

Seth and Veronics hug
BRUNDLE

INT STATHISS OFFICE- DAY
Stathis and Veronica are sat in Stathiss office talking Veronica seems very

tired and worn out

STATHIS

epidemic

VERONICA

INT BRUNDLES LAB- DAY
We see from the roof as Veronica enters the Lab

VERONICA
Seth Seth

BRUNDLE
No no Up here

Veronics is shocked to look up and see Brundle walking on all fours on the
ceiling He moves very well and seems quite used to it

BRUNDLE

Ive gotten pretty good at it havent I You know its almost second nature
Stopped biting my nails Oh look at this whats this I dont know I seem
to be stricken by a disease with a purpose wouldnt you say Maybe not such a
bad purpose after all

VERONICA
I cant stay

Brundle is now horizontal and stuck to the door He jumps down and walks
close to Veronica

BRUNDLE

Why not Why cant you

VERONICA
I cant take it Its too much

BRUNDLE
Whats there to take The disease has just revealed its purpose We dont
have to worry about contagion anymore I know what the disease wants

VERONICA
What does the disease want

BRUNDLE
It wants to turn me into something else Thats not too terrible is it Most
people would give anything to be turned into something else

VERONICA
Turned into what

BRUNDLE

What do you think a fly Am I becoming a hundred and eighty five pound fly
No Im becoming something thats never existed before Im becoming
Brundlefly dont you think thats worth a Nobel prize or two Here

Brundle brings the camera near to the table in front of Veronica

BRUNDLE
Im going to give a demonstration that I think youll want to record for
prosperity

Brundle throws alot of the Rubbish off of the table and sits in front of the
Camera

BRUNDLE

I think we must chronicle the life and times of Brundlefly dont you At
the very least it should make a fabulous Childrens book You seem tired
You got me there How does Brundlefly eat Well he found out the very hard
and painful way that he eats very much the same way a fly eats His teeth are
now useless because although he can chew up solid food he cant digest it
solid food hurts So like a fly Brundlefly breaks down the solid with a
corrosive enzyme pleasurably called Vomit drop He regurgitates on his
food it liquifies and then he sucks it back up You ready for a
demonstration kids Here goes

INT VERONICAS APARTMENT- NIGHT
We see Brundle on the screen in Veronicas apartment as Stathis watches it

STATHIS
My God My God

Suddenly Veronica enters and goes straight down the corridor in tears

STATHIS
Hey Ronnie Ronnie

Stathis follows and Discovers her sat down crying He kneels down next to
her

STATHIS
What is it
VERONICA
Im pregnant

STATHIS
No Oh no

VERONICA
Im pregnant with Seths baby

STATHIS
What do you want to do

VERONICA
I dont know I just I dont know

INT BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT

We are close on Brundles fingers as they dance over the keys of the computer
keyboard Brundle has cut the fingers off a pair of yellow rubber kitchen
gloves and jammed them down over his fingertips so that his fingers wont
stick to the keyboard

CU MONITOR which reads

GENE-SPLICING PROGRAM NOW IN PLACE

TELEPOD 1 TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT A

TELEPOD 2 TRANSMITTER POD SUBJECT B

TELEPOD 3 RECEIVER POD FOR GENETICALLY FUSED A-B COMBINATION SUBJECT

We pull back to see that in front of Brundle and his keyboard stand not two
but THREE telepods the third one of a somewhat older and more handbuilt
vintage than the other two- the original PROTOTYPE TELEPOD which has been
sitting in a corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and was noticed by Veronica
on her first visit to the lab In TELEPOD A sits a monkey in TELEPOD B an
alley cat TELEPOD C the old prototype receiver is empty Brundle operates
the machine The monitor says READY FOR FUSION Brundle presses the ACCEPT
button The telepods go through their normal disintegration routine as the
animals outlines appear on the monitor in split screen fashion But now as
the reintegration process begins a stream of data concerning this new
experiment the fusion of monkey and cat floods the screen The basic
message that gets across to us through all the hi-tech compu-talk is
PERCENTAGE OF MONKEY-63 PERCENTAGE OF CAT-37

These numbers fluctuate as the machine tries to strike a molecular
balance between the two creatures Finally an outline of the fused creature
begind to form on the screen brundle looks up to see the actual creature
forming and it is indeed grotesque two heads- one monkey one cat- at odd
angles to each other six legs which are not quite symmetrically placed on
the monkey torso cat tail As the creature solidifies and the light goes
off it sits there in the telepod for a moment half-reclining as though
crippled Brundle gets up goes to the third telepod and with great
apprehension opens the door The thing just sits there slumped for a beat
then SUDDENLY LEAPS UP AT HIM its two heads SHREIKING It jumps on his arm
clinging snarling then drops to the floor The two heads begin to bite each
other blood begins to flow- the thing now running around in mad floppy
circles smearing blood everywhere Brundle is horrified He grabs a metal
rod leaning in a corner and begins to smash at the deformed thing He keeps
smashing at it until it stops its hideous screeching and lies dead mangled

on the floor Brundle wraps it up in a towel and throws it into the
refrigerator He draws the old torn sheet over the third telepod so he
doesnt have to look at it again Back at the monitor the screen is flashing
the words FUSION SUCCESSFUL RECEIVER TELEPOD 3

Brundle puts his face in his hands for a few moments then pulls himself
together He pulls the rubber fingertips off his fingers and throws them to
the ground Brundle has now developed some insect-like tics and mannerisms
his head twitching with nervous little jerks and his long fingers in constant
motion We see clearly now that all of Brundles fly characteristics have
been accentuated even further The metallic-green hair which completely
covers his face is much thicker than before and the hernia-like bulge in his
side is more protuberant now stretched to the bursting point and obviously
causing Brundle some pain Brundle looks at the skylight The sky is clear
the moon is a scimitar On an impulse he jumps up on the wall sticking
there for a beat Then with incredible agility he ascends the wall crosses
the celing toward the skylight ON THE CEILING Brundle glides on all fours
upside down towards the skylight Once there he crawls into it and opens it
up

EXT LAB ROOFTOP-NIGHT

Brundle clambers out of the skylight onto the roof The night is gorgeous
clean and bright the sky packed with stars Brundle breathes deeply He is
still alive isnt he He can still respond to the beauty of the night cant
he

EXT MONTAGE- BRUNDLES TRAVELS- NIGHT

We follow Brundle on his solitary sojourn in a MONTAGE SEQUENCE He climbs
walls with amazing ability leaps from rooftop to rooftop hangs upside down
from ledges and lampposts eavesdropping on the city life around and below
him the inhabitants unaware of the unusual and shadowy observer in their
midst He scurries along the girder of a bridge gazing down on the traffic
and the river below him These moments should be poetic even beautiful
joyous The moon is luminous the dark night exquisite Resigned to his fate
and momentarily forgetful of his future Brundle seems to be reveling in his
unique powers A brief euphoric fling

DISSOLVE TO

Brundle leaps across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the building opposite
him He smiles with smug satisfaction at his feat then suddenly winces
grabbing his side with one of his hands WE HEAR A CRACKING SPLITTING SOUND
Brundle muffles a startled cry and losing his balance slides several feet
down the wall before regaining hold He looks down at the huge bulge in his
side and sees that it is starting to split open

Brundle is horrified and in pain He starts to quickly move down the side of
the building but the pain impedes his progress He manages to get down at
least another floor before hes hit with another sharp pain He doubles up
and his tenuous grip on the wall causes him to slide another several feet
downward before he regains his grip The side is gaping wide now and
SOMETHING is starting to protrude Brundle is in shock another ripple of
pain causes him to release his grasp entirely and he falls to the ground ina
dirty narrow alley where he writhes in pain as a STRANGE HAIRY STICKLIKE
APPENDAGE--ACTUALLY THE BEGINNINGS OF A FLYLIKE LEG-- begins to unfold
awkwardly out of his sideDespite his excrutiating pain Brundle watches with
fixated wide-eyed terror at his latest transformation The insect leg now
begins to probe around function like a real leg almost with a mind of its
own Grotesque as Brundle has become he cant accept the next step towards
real insectness which this new leg represents He screams at the leg

BRUNDLE (SCREAMING AT THE LEG)
No No I wont I wont I wont I wont

Brundle grabs at the leg holds it subdues it and then begins to gnaw at it
with his teeth at its base twisting himself into an agonized ball in order
to do it The leg begins to lever at his back small hooklike protrusions all
along its underside catching in the flesh of Brundles back tearing it in
protest against Brundles attempt at amputation Finally Brundle has severed
the leg with his teeth The leg drops off leaving a strand or two of stringy
gristle hanging from the knobby stump in Brundles side The leg twitches on
the ground tries to extend itself Brundle looks at the leg in shock his
eyes crazed like an animal who has been caught in a leg-trap and has had to
gnaw off the leg to be free Brundle tries to steady himself then staggers
away down the alley As he goes he wipes the insect blood from his lips with
his two forearms In exactly the same way that flies clean their faces

EXT THE HOSPITAL- DAY
Veronica is wheeled into a Hospital with Stathis by her side
INT THE HOSPITAL- DAY

Veronica with Stathis still by her side is wheeled down a corridor by an
orderly

VERONICA
Stathis Im scared

STATHIS

CUT TO
Veronica wakjs up in bed Screaming it was a dream She pulls the covers over
herself

INT BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT

Brundle is stood at his computer typing After reading the displayed text
regarding a cure by gene-Splicing Brundle asks for information

BRUNDLE
I want a disk Give me preliminary integration

The computers scrolls Voice Not recognised down the side of the screen
Brundle stops it and bites on his pencil which causes his front teeth to
fall out onto the keyboard He counts his teeth with his tounge and sighs

CUT TO

Brundle stumbles into the Bathroom and opens his medicine cabinet which is
full of body parts which have fallen off Brundle talks to his teeth before
confinding them to the cabinet

BRUNDLE
Youre relics Yes you are Vestigial archeological redundant Artifacts of
a bygone era Of historical interest only

As Brundle closes the cabinet he catches sight of Veronica who has entered
the Lab and is standing opposite Brundle with Brundles bedroom in between
them

BRUNDLE
Youve missed some good moments Is that why youre here To catch up

VERONICA
I wanted

BRUNDLE
My teeth have begun to fall out The medicine cabinets now the Brundle
Museum of Natural History Do you want to see what else is in it

VERONICA

No

BRUNDLE

Then what do you want

VERONICA

I came to tell you uh I uh I just I wanted to see you before
BRUNDLE

You have to leave now and never come back here Have you ever heard of

brutal No compassion no compromise We cant trust the insect Id like to

VERONICA
I dont know what youre trying to say

Brundle Steps forward Veronica takes a step back and Brundle gazes up
through the skylight

BRUNDLE
Im saying Im saying I-Im an insect who dreamt he was a man and
loved it But now the dream is over and the insect is awake

VERONICA
No no Seth

BRUNDLE
Im saying Ill hurt you if you stay

Veronica leaves and Brundle begins to cry

EXT BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
Veronica runs crying out of the lab She is met by Stathis who stands by the
car

VERONICA
Lets go Lets do it now

STATHIS
Now Wait what did he say

VERONICA
I couldnt tell him Lets go damn it

STATHIS
No I think we should wait a few days i dont think youre in the right
frame of mind

VERONICA
No I want it out of my body now you should have seen him there could be
anything in here In me In my body
STATHIS
I dont know if I can arrange it now right now tonight Why do we have to
run around in the dark like a couple of

VERONICA
Because I dont want it in my body Do you understand me I dont want it in
my body

As Veronica and Stathis drive off we cut up to See Brundle watching from the
rooftop He moves away into the shadows

INT DR CHEEVERS OFFICE- NIGHT
DR CHEEVERS is sat at his Desk while Veronica stares out of the Window
Stathis stands behind her

CHEEVERS
Well okay whats the story

STATHIS
Shes pregnant and she wants to have an abortion

CHEEVERS
In the middle of the night

STATHIS
We have good reason to believe that this child will be deformed

CHEEVERS
Yes but in the middle of the night

STATHIS
Look Brent Please

CHEEVERS
Is it your child

STATHIS

No its the its the child of a man who is deformed

CHEEVERS

Listen I dont mean to interfere but I detect a certain uncertainty

here You know there are tests we can do that determine whether or not

VERONICA
I dont want tests done Tests cant guarantee anything The baby could start
off normal then become I want an abortion Ill do it myself if I have to

CUT TO THE OPERATING ROOM
CHEEVERS
Okay if you can just slip into that well be on our way in no time

Stathis and Cheevers go into the other room leaving Veronica alone
Suddenly Brundle jumps through the window and walks towards Veronica

VERONICA
Wait Seth No
Brundle picks up Veronica and runs back out Stathis runs into the room just
in time to glimple Brundle escape with Veronica

EXT A ROOFTOP- NIGHT
Brundle slowly puts Veronica down and the talk

BRUNDLE
Why did you want to kill Brundle The baby might be all thats left of the
real me Please dont kill me

VERONICA
I cant have it Im afraid

BRUNDLE
Please have the baby

VERONICA
I cant I cant

BRUNDLE
Too bad Too bad

INT BRUNDLES LAB- NIGHT
The door of Brundles lab slides open and Stathis Borans enters He slides the
door shut behind him and we pan around to discover the lab is empty

Stathis slowly walks disgusted by his surroundings and the horrific
stench of the Lab

CUT TO

Stathis opens his case and reveals a shotgun which he loads and arms himself
with He slowly walks over to Brundles computer and presses a button which
brings down the fusion program

Telepod 1 Transmitter of Subject A
Telepod 2 Transmitter of Subject B
Telepod 3 Recieve of genetically fused A-B combination Subject

Stathis stares at the pods and behind him we glimpse the shadow of Brundlefly
on the roof above him Brundle drops from the roof screaming and knocks
Stathis to the ground Stathis looks up and is horrified by Brundles
appearance He tries to shoot but Brundle overpowers him and pulls him to
his feet by clenching his wrist

Brundle then proceeds to vomit onto Stathiss hand which melts away
as Stathis screams Brundle drops Stathis to the ground and then repeats the
process on Stathiss ankle to which he then pulls away the foot

Brundle stands up and raises his head above Stathiss He opens his
mouth and prepares to Vomit on Stathiss face

VERONICA
No Dont Dont please Please

Brundle stops and sees Veronica screaming from the skylight above him He
moves quickly across the kitchen and slides up the wall and across the

ceiling on all fours until he is facing Veronica

BRUNDLE
Help me Help me be human

VERONICA
How

CUT TO
Brundle holding onto Veronica jumps down into the lab He puts her down
onto her feet and holding her hand explains the plan

BRUNDLE
Well I go there and uh you go there We come apart then and then we
-come together there You me and the baby together

Brundle starts the countdown for the fusion program

VERONICA
No

BRUNDLE
Well be the ultimate family A family of three joined together in one body
More human than I am alone

As Veronica tries to Pull away from Brundle she rips his jaw off and flings
it to the floor screaming This starts of a chain reaction as Brundle dead

outer layer of Skin falls away to reveal the inner result of this mutation

Brundle throws Veronica into Pod 1 and begins to climb into Pod 2

Meanwhile as the computer counts down Stathis manages to prop
himself up a support beam

When Brundle is locked inside the pod Stathis shoots the cable
connecting Veronicas Pod to the computer eliminating her from the fusion
program

Stathis falls to the floor and crawls across to Veronica

Brundle meanwhile tries to escape from his pod by punching the glass
away He succeeds but as he opens the door and steps out the computer
teleports him along with part of the door frame and telepod

Veronica is freed from the pod and she helps Stathis sit up against
Pod 2 She picks up the shotgun as Brundle arrives in Pod 3 The door opens
and out falls the helpless Brundle physically fused with part of the door
He slowsly crawls across to Veronica who is in tears He slowly places the
barrel of the shitgun to his forehead indicating what he wants Veronica to
do

VERONICA
No I cant

Brundle voices a slow painful moan

VERONICA
No I cant No No God

Veronica pulls the trigger killing Seth She falls to the floor and begins
to sob

FADE OUT
