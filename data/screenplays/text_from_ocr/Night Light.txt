THE FOLLOWING STORY WILL UNFOLD EXCLUSIVELY
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A SINGLE FLASHLIGHT

ON BLACK the quiet lull of metal threading being unscrewed
THUNK THUNK Two D BATTERIES pounded into a FLASHLIGHT

SNAP With the flick of a switch --

INT CHEVY SUBURBAN - SUNSET

-- a powerful LIGHT flares out around us establishing our
point of view from inside a FLASHLIGHT

The tungsten filament burns blue for a fraction of a second
before diffusing into a gold beam strong enough to light the
interior of this SUV

We glimpse a few items strewn about SIX FLAGS PHOTO KEY-
CHAIN THE SELECTED WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE and a
BATTERY OPERATED AIR PUMP (sans batteries)

The FLASHLIGHT is placed on the front seat We hear CLOTHES
being removed A BEN and JERRYS UNIFORM is tossed into the
foreground followed by a PLASTIC NAME TAG that reads simply

Name
ROBIN

Favorite Ice Cream
CHUNKY MONKEY

The light is lifted out of the vehicle as the front door is
slammed shut In the reflection of the driver’s side window
we see the innocent face of the girl who holds the light

This is ROBIN and even though the light is obscuring
most of her face we can tell she’s quietly crying

Using the window as a mirror she dries her eyes and applies
makeup She tests a couple fake smiles before heading around
back

She opens the trunk door A GOLDEN RETRIEVER (KRAMER) is
sleeping in the cargo

ROBIN
Wake up Kramer

Robin sets the FLASHLIGHT on the bumper and crawls back to
her dog

It’s the first time we’ve seen her in full and she has the
slightly awkward feel of someone who just recently came into
her good looks

She unwraps a STICK OF GUM while studying her CELL PHONE

ROBIN

(to Kramer)
So according to Facebook Ben
likes sports (boring) rock
climbing (yikes) Abercrombie and
Fitch (gross) “The Da Vinci Code”
(illiterate) and hates Chunky
Monkey ice cream (total bullshit)
But

Robin tosses her phone into the front and lets Kramer lick
her face

ROBIN
(to Kramer)
-for some reason he loves dogs
So I need you to play wingman for
me tonight okay boy

Robin slides out of the Suburban with the FLASHLIGHT and
confronts the wilderness in front of her

EXT FOREST ENTRY - SUNSET

Kramer leads Robin into the forest Dead leaves crunch
beneath their feet Clouds of breath leave their mouth

ROBIN (0S)

(softly to herself)
Hey Ben Hi Ben How’re you How
Are You Ben

(no big deal)
-oh this is just my dog Yeah my
dog Kramer Yeah golden
retriever

(beat)
Really That’s crazy we have so
much in common

Kramer sprints ahead

ROBIN (0S)
Hey Kramer

Robin chases
ROBIN (0S)
Come Sit Bad dog

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

Two GIRLS WITH FLASHLIGHTS are the subject of Kramer’s
affection

AMELIA is the redheaded cheerleader with the bashful
smile And then there’s NIA who has an apparent air of
superiority

NIA
What’s your name

ROBIN (0S)
Robin

NIA
I was talking to the dog

ROBIN (0S)
(covering)
I know That’s Kramer

NIA
Well keep Kramer away from me

ROBIN (0S)

ROBIN (0S)
(softly to herself)

NIA
It’s weird

ROBIN (0S)
Does anyone know when Ben is

NIA

ROBIN (0S)

Nia steals the FLASHLIGHT from Robin’s hand and shines it in
her face interrogation style Robin squints

NIA (0S)
Why
ROBIN
Just wondering
NIA (0S)
Youre so weird
ROBIN
Just wondering when everyones
coming
NIA (0S)

Do you wanna know when everyones

Robin turns red

ROBIN
Can I have my flashlight back

NIA (0S)
(off look)
Everyone knows you have a fuck-
crush on Ben

ROBIN
I don’t like Ben

-- as a face appears behind Robin

NIA (0S)
Ben
BEN heard everything Robin’s frozen face turns from
embarrassment to horror

NIA (0S)
(to Ben disapproving)
Your guest brought a dog

Nia throws the FLASHLIGHT back to Robin Robin watches Ben as
he pets her dog Clean-cut all-American boy We can see why
the girls are in love with him

BEN
(to Robin)
Excited for your first flashlight
games

ROBIN (0S)
(trying too hard)
I know right It’s totally
gonna be so much fun Thanks for
inviting me so much

Nia crosses glaring at Robin

CHRIS
Whoa where did you guys find the
dog

Robin whips around to find CHRIS the final member of
the group He playfully shines his FLASHLIGHT back at Robin
temporarily blinding us

ROBIN (0S)
(covering)
I’m just to ‘cause I had to - my
mom who’s really annoying said I
had to walk him --

CHRIS
-- so we have to baby-sit all
night

NIA
Exactly

ROBIN (0S)
No we can just tie him to a tree
It’s all he does all day anyway

BEN

Robin pans back to Ben and Kramer who are getting along
famously
ROBIN (0S)
Kramer

BEN

NIA
Robin

NIA
ROBIN

Whips back to the girls

NIA
(sabotage)

ROBIN (0S)

AMELIA
Kathy told Nia that she thought she
saw you yesterday cleaning counters
or something

ROBIN (0S)
No I no I wouldn’t work there

NIA
It’s so nasty Like I don’t have a
job because I’m busy studying to
get into Berkley but if I did
I’m not working in that shit hole
for minimum wage

AMELIA
People think because we don’t have
jobs that we don’t work hard it’s
like we work just as hard if not
more hard than you

NIA
Yeah like congratulations you

a lawyer

(MORE)
NIA (contd)
That’s really ambitious of me I
have like no free time Ever

ROBIN (0S)
(softly)
Yeah

CHRIS
Girls what’s your battery
situation

ROBIN (0S)
Oh I looked for more in my car

CHRIS
(serious)
We’re not here for cliff jumping

AMELIA
Mine are old too

ROBIN (0S)

(to herself)
we’re playing kid’s games all
night
CHRIS

ROBIN (0S)
Amelia can have them

Robin pans back to Ben and Kramer who have since been joined
by a flirtatious (and sudden dog lover) Nia

NIA
(to Ben)
Isn’t he adorable

CHRIS (0S)
Robin just I don’t know Try to
conserve battery please

she’s not listening

ROBIN (0S)
Hey Ben

Ben looks up So does Nia She doesn’t like where this is
going
ROBIN (0S)
I’m reading this book “The Da
Vinci Code” and it’s really creepy
so far Do you know if it’s any

BEN
It’s pretty sweet Which part are

ROBIN (0S)
Oh uh you know the part with the
painting by Da Vinci and the code

BEN
That part’s tight

ROBIN (0S)
Totally tight

NIA
(to Ben)
The movie’s so great Tom Hanks is
the best

BEN
(hates the movie)
Yeah it was okay

Chris jumps in front of Robin’s beam

CHRIS
Robin Walmart’s an hour away I’m
not going back for batteries

ROBIN (0S)
Sorry

Robin turns off her FLASHLIGHT

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT PERIMETER FENCE - NIGHT

The light comes back on a little later Kramer is awkwardly
caught in a BARBED WIRE fence While Ben and Robin help
Kramer through the group squeezes past one by one Some have
their flashlights on some don’t We UPCUT mid conversation --

NIA
-- were definitely going to Cabo
for spring break and I want to
stay at a resort hotel
AMELIA
All inclusive

CHRIS
With a big ass pool

ROBIN (0S)
and a water slide

NIA
A water slide Are you four

ROBIN (0S)
Theyre kinda fun

NIA
Ill have fun at the bar

Ben slides through the fence with ease Robin follows We may
or may not notice the ALUMINUM SIGN that reads

TRESPASSING PROHIBITED
JUMPING FROM CLIFFS HAS RESULTED IN INJURY AND DEATH

There’s a CREEK churning up ahead where the group impatiently
waits for Robin

BEN

I didn’t say Cabo I said like
Cabo Google it Covington Woods is
on the same list as the Golden Gate
Bridge some mountain in Japan and
that place like Cabo

(beat)
People come here to die

AMELIA

Sure so statistically speaking
youre more likely to commit
suicide in this forest than any
other place in the Midwest

(beat)
It’s the altitude right Makes you
do stuff you don’t want to do

CHRIS
The only thing that makes me “do
stuff I don’t want to do” is
vagina So there must be a high
concentration of vagina here

BEN
(to Chris)
Yeah you’re here

AMELIA
Or maybe suicidal people just like
jumping from high places

Robin is the only one struggling through the fence The
longer she takes the more embarrassed she gets Her sleeve
snags a staple She yanks it with force --
ROBIN (0S)
(sudden pain)
--mmhh

-- and slices her finger Her bloody skin fills the frame

BEN
Everything okay

ROBIN (0S)
I’m cool

NIA
(almost under her breath)
No you’re not

Robin turns off her light

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT CREEK - NIGHT

A massive fallen tree extends the width of this creek acting
as a bridge over the violent current below

One by one the teens cross Ben holds Nia’s hand as he
cautiously helps her over We UPCUT mid conversation --

AMELIA
-- and they built a church

CHRIS
Who

Amelia crosses

AMELIA
Here (maybe in the 30’s) To stop
people from jumping off the Crest

BEN
“Here’s a Bible don’t kill
yourself”

AMELIA
Exactly

NIA
You know it’s true because of all
the memorials

AMELIA
The white crosses

Amelia is followed by Chris who crosses the tree backwards
like a balance beam holding a RED COOLER showing off

CHRIS
No if I was gonna commit suicide
Id do something cool like drive
my Vespa into a tornado Or swallow
dynamite You can’t just go to some
gay ass forest and jump off a cliff

-- as Chris jumps onto the bank

CHRIS
It’s cliche

Robin gets down on all fours scared practically hugging the
tree as she crosses aware of how uncool she looks She
occasionally looks down to remind herself it’s a big fall

NIA
Yeah like that kid from our
school What was his name

CHRIS
Which kid

NIA
(air quotes)
The dude who “fell” off the cliff
here

AMELIA
Didn’t Robin know him

NIA
(to Robin)

Oh God you didn’t socialize with
that failure did you I’m sorry
but suicide is the path of least
resistance If you kill yourself
you deserve to literally lose at
life

(MORE)

NIA (contd)
(laughing)
Is that mean
-- as Robin turns off her light
CLICK TO BLACK

TRUTH ORDARE

EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT

A bit later Robin’s light comes in on her nervous hand which
holds her SIX FLAGS KEY-CHAIN like a vise

AMELIA
-- dare

CHRIS
I dare you to text me a naked
picture

AMELIA

(deadly serious)
That’s not funny My cousin sent a
naked picture of herself to her own
Gmail account and got charged with
distribution of child pornography

CHRIS
How is that even possible Sexting
is our generation’s first base

AMELIA
She’s a registered sex offender

CHRIS
So you’re not sending the picture --

AMELIA
-- truth

CHRIS
(disappointed)
Truth When was the first time
you ever touched yourself in your
swimsuit area in an inappropriate
fashion And Robin wants all the
disgusting details

Upon hearing her name Robin focuses her light on the group
who we see are gathered around a tree stump

AMELIA
(thinks a moment)
Christmas vacation My parents were
outside caroling with the
neighbors And I was watching
Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer on
cable

BEN
The claymation

CHRIS
That’s hot on some level

AMELIA
I’ve never forgiven myself There
was just something about that nose

NIA
Okay I feel better I had an
affair with Mr Grinch

AMELIA
(gross)
What
NIA

It’s like he stole Christmas so
he’s a bastard but he was so
damn exotic

CHRIS
This is why Katy Perry’s boobs
can’t be on “Sesame Street”

BEN
(exactly)
Kids are perverted as shit Disney
movies Princess Jasmine was my
Kryptonite

AMELIA
What about Robin

ROBIN (0S)
Me

(fuck it)
Uh I went through a cereal box
phase Capn’ Crunch Tony the
Tiger To an eight-year-old Count
Chocula is like Johnny Depp My
parents had to start buying off-
brand cereal

CHRIS
(nodding)
The shit that comes in bags

ROBIN (0S)
Never tastes as good

Ben lifts a BOTTLE OF BEER

BEN
Robin

ROBIN
I’m fine Thanks

Nia immediately takes the beer Robin turns off her light
CLICK TO BLACK
GREEK STATUE
EVERYONE (VO)
One two three
EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT
Everyone’s FLASHLIGHTS TURN ON simultaneously creating a
spotlight on Ben who stands half-naked on the tree stump
frozen like a statue showing off his eight minute abs and
BOXER BRIEFS This is a game the teenagers play called
BEN
(yelling)
“Tm a Greek Statue” “I’m a Greek
Statue” “I’m a Greek Statue”
On the third chant everyone turns off their lights

CLICK TO BLACK
NEVER HAVE I EVER

EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT

Later There’s an OWL moving in the tree canopy Robin’s
FLASHLIGHT searches for it as the group carries on

BEN
“T never” abused Adderall to
study for a test

Chris reluctantly takes a drink from his beer
Ben Nia

CHRIS
(defensive)
Dude you know my psychiatrist
diagnosed me with ADHD

BEN
Your psychiatrist is your brother
and that was two and a half years
after you were already addicted to
Adderall

CHRIS
I’m not addicted I’m dependent

BEN
What’s the difference

AMELIA
“I never” walked in on my
parents boinking

and Chris all take a drink

AMELIA
It’s okay guys they weren’t having
intercourse they were just
wrestling

NIA
“I never” tried to kill myself
in Covington Woods

Robin’s hand comes into frame as she knocks back her first
beer The group CHEERS We’re not sure if she’s serious or

joking

CHRIS
Oh shit Robin’s on the board
muthafuckas

CLICK TO BLACK

THE NERVOUS GAME

EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT

Later still Ben’s smiling face fills the frame He’s close
to Robin Very close Robin’s light follows his hand as he
places it on her thigh It’s almost romantic

BEN
Are you nervous yet

ROBIN (0S)
No

Ben’s hand moves to her waist It takes us a beat to realize
they are playing the flashlight equivalent of “The Nervous
Game”

BEN
Are you nervous yet

ROBIN (0S)
(voice cracks)
No

Ben’s hand moves to Robin’s stomach

BEN
Are you nervous yet

ROBIN (0S)
(softly)
No

Ben moves his hand to Robin’s breast

BEN
Are you nervous yet

ROBIN (0S)
(beat confessing)
nervous

Ben removes his hand like a gentleman and smiles
acknowledging the awkwardness

NIA
(almost under her breath)
Prude

CLICK TO BLACK

THE TRAIN GAME

EXT RAILROAD TRACK - NIGHT

A line of track cuts the forest for miles In the faraway
distance we can barely see the glow of a FREIGHT TRAIN fast
approaching

BEN
Okay I think it’s close enough
Who’s first

Chris runs onto the track sets his FLASHLIGHT onto a WOODEN
SLEEPER between the rails then sprints toward the oncoming
train

CHRIS
One two three four

He counts aloud for each wooden sleeper he runs past

ROBIN (0S)
(to Ben)
What happens if you don’t get to
your flashlight in time

CHRIS
--seven eight

BEN
I don’t know that’s never happened
before

CHRIS
-nine ten

On “ten” Chris races back to his FLASHLIGHT and lifts it

CHRIS
Amelia

Amelia runs onto the track as Chris runs off She sets her
FLASHLIGHT onto the same sleeper then runs toward the train
which is now only a few hundred feet away

AMELIA
-seven eight nine ten eleven

On “eleven” Amelia runs back to her FLASHLIGHT

AMELIA
Ben

Ben repeats the same action Everyone watches in suspense as
the train gets closer and closer

BEN
-nine ten eleven twelve

On “twelve” the train is only a couple hundred feet away
Ben grabs his FLASHLIGHT

BEN
Nia

Nia looks at Robin with a wicked smile It’s chilling She
then sprints up to the track and repeats the same action

NIA
ten eleven twelve thirteen

On “thirteen” Nia stands frozen on the track for a beat
prolonging the moment letting the train gain some ground By
the time Nia grabs her FLASHLIGHT the train is dangerously
close

NIA
Robin

Robin stumbles onto the track She sets her flashlight onto
the wooden sleeper Our vision starts to tremor as the train
gets closer Crushed stone rattles around in the foreground

ROBIN
-one two three four

AMELIA
Robin wait

Robin gets smaller as the train gets bigger

ROBIN
seven eight nine

BEN
Robin get off the track

ROBIN
twelve thirteen
(triumphant)
fourteen

THE TRAIN’S HORN ROARS TWENTY FEET AWAY ROBIN SCREAMS TEN
FEET SHE RACES BACK TOWARD US REACHING OUT THE ENORMITY OF
THE TRAIN HULKING BEHIND HER LIKE A GIANT

BUT IT’S TOO LATE

ROBIN DIVES OFF THE TRACK JUST AS --

THE TRAIN SCUDS OVER US EACH CAR VIOLENTLY WHOOSHING
OVERHEAD THE UNDER-CARRIAGE MERE INCHES AWAY FROM CRUSHING
THE LENS OF THE LIGHT

The final car passes Our vision stabilizes Robin crawls
into frame panting nervously

CHRIS
Holy shit Your light still
works

BEN

(utter excitement)
Good Because you’re definitely
gonna need it

Robin picks up her FLASHLIGHT

ROBIN (0S)
(breathless )
For what

CLICK TO BLACK

NIGHTLIGHT

EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT

The FLASHLIGHT is propped up on a toppled tree aimed at
Robin who sits isolated on the stump ten feet away

The other members of the group move in and out of our field
of view as they prepare for a game called “Nightlight”

ROBIN
I don’t feel good

NIA
Like how

ROBIN
Sick To my stomach I haven’t
eaten all day and --
NIA
-- well anorexia is unhealthy
Robin

Nia ties a BLINDFOLD around Robin’s terrified face

ROBIN
No I’m have a sore throat
Someone feel my forehead

Nia snaps a picture of Robin using a DIGITAL CAMERA

NIA
Youre fine

ROBIN
I just think it’s stupid Covington
has wild animals and cliffs and I
have to work early in the morning --

NIA
(wait)
-- so where do you work

ROBIN
(covering)
Not work I mean I have to get
Kramer back for something and

Ben sits on the stump and wraps his arm around Robin

BEN
I know it seems lame but the first
time’s always the best

He rubs her arm to warm her up It’s flirtatious

ROBIN
(enamored)
Really

BEN
It’s so scary

ROBIN
(shit)
Cool

NIA
(discreetly to
ChrisAmelia)
The old church

CHRIS
(discreetly)
Huh

NIA
(discreetly)
If we get separated

AMELIA
Head start

NIA
Bitch wait

Nia and Amelia race into the woods Chris and Ben stay back a
moment longer to tie Kramer to a nearby tree

CHRIS

Nia’s wearing

BEN
Disgustingly hot

CHRIS
I came in my pants a little

Robin looks around as if she’s not listening to the “guy
talk” but the truth is she’s hearing everything She quietly
straightens her back teases her hair and sucks in her
tummy

CHRIS
I love slutty chicks And I will
not apologize for that

BEN
No one’s asking you to

CHRIS
Something about “tramp stamps” and
“tongue rings” I’m always gonna
talk shit about girls who have
them but the truth is it’s
instant Viagra

(beat introspective)

Plus I watched “Jersey Shore”
before coming here and that show
always gets me horny for some
reason

BEN
Right now I’m asking for an
apology

The boys finish tieing the dog and grab their FLASHLIGHTS

ROBIN
(summoning courage)
Ben you know uh
(clears her throat)
I wanted to thank you again For
inviting me It’s been fun hanging
with the cool kids for once

Silence

ROBIN
(suddenly flush)
Did we start

Robin steals a quick peak from her blindfold They’re gone
She pulls the blindfold back down and shivers a little
embarrassed a little cold She sighs and a cloud of breath
leaves her mouth The temperature’s dropping fast

The tall grass and greenery in the foreground seems to be
stretching and unfolding towards the warmth of the light

Subtle but unnerving Almost imperceptible

Just then twigs SNAP in the distance Must be Robin’s
friends hiding

The black corners of the frame are stagnant until

A heavy breeze awakes the canopy above Leaves swirl down
around Robin

THROUGH THIS BLIZZARD OF DEAD FOLIAGE WE NOTICE THE
FLASHLIGHT ROLL SLIGHTLY AS IF NUDGED BY AN UNNATURAL FORCE

Kramer approaches the flashlight with caution fighting the
leash around his neck His face edges into the lens of the
light fogging it up His eyes dilate He BARKS

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS And then
Kramer gets quiet He begins WHIMPERING The dog backs away

terrified by something only an animal with an innate
understanding of nature can sense

Robin begins getting scared when she realizes how scared
Kramer is

She removes the BLINDFOLD

ROBIN
(softly)
Kramer

She looks around and smiles It’s almost funny how scary this
place can be when you’re alone Almost

BARK
The smile fades
KRAMER’S GROWL BECOMES DEEP MENACING HIS BODY TIGHTENS

ROBIN
Kramer

Dust particles seem to levitate in front of the lens

Robin’s eyes dart around searching the forest behind us Her
eyes try to pin point the source of every CREAK and CRACK

A whisp of wind absorbs the floating dust

Robin stands and lifts the FLASHLIGHT

Kramer’s body momentarily relaxes as she pets his cold fur
She kisses Kramer’s forehead before leaving him behind

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

A sphere of light creates a window into the dense forest
Everything else is PITCH BLACK

We can assume from Robin’s quiet descent into the dark that
the object of “Nightlight” is to find your friends using a
flashlight

She marches onward hyper aware Every nuance of the forest -
every subtle crack of a dead leaf or tree limb fluttering in
the wind - has the weight of Godzilla marching through Tokyo

ROBIN (0S)
I give up “Nightlight”

SILENCE Robin notices something glowing in the distance But
it’s not a flashlight

The glow burns brighter when Robin rakes it with her light
It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before

She takes a couple steps forward

BARKING IN THE DISTANCE

Robin whips back to where she came from Too far away to see
anything

THE BARKING GETS MORE VIOLENT

ROBIN (0S)
Fuck

(louder )
I said “Nightlight”

Again nothing As Robin waits for her friends to reveal
themselves a wind moves through the trees like a presence
Robin’s breathing tightens Something’s wrong

ROBIN (0S)
“NIGHTLIGHT”

And like clockwork - BOOM BOOM BOOM - beams of light explode
in the distance all around one after the other until all
four of Robin’s friends have unveiled their hiding position

The lights close in around her accompanied by laughter

ROBIN (0S)
(feigned excitement)
That was cool

CHRIS
Did you see the Covington ghost

ROBIN (0S)
Yeah the glowing herbaceous moss --

BEN
-- shhh there it is
(whispering)
If you get really quiet you can
almost hear it

Beyond the ambient hum of cicadas and crickets there is a
sound It’s like a siren only it’s not a siren Something
more dangerous A faint drone that sounds like a million
voices crying out

CHRIS
(whispering)
Sweet

AMELIA
(whispering)
What is it

NIA
(whispering)
Sounds like voices

CHRIS

(whispering)
What if it’s the voices of everyone

whos died here

ROBIN (0S)
It’s a river

Beat Everyone listens

CHRIS
(agreeing)
Yeah
(beat)
A river of voices

ROBIN (0S)
I have to get the dog home

BEN
Robin you’re not leaving

ROBIN (0S)
I kind of have to

BEN
You kind of can’t

ROBIN (0S)
Why not

BEN
Because

Ben steals Robin’s FLASHLIGHT She doesn’t seem to mind

BEN (0S)
--I’m using your flashlight for my
turn
ROBIN
(smiling)

Careful it’s sentimental

BEN (0S)
Was it a present from someone
special

ROBIN

Something like that
BEN (0S)
Well here’s a present from me

Ben hands Robin his BLUE COLEMAN

ROBIN
(flirting)
I can’t believe you’re gonna leave
me with this piece of shit What if
the Covington Ghost comes after me

BEN (0S)
(laughing)
I don’t think that light is bright
enough for the Covington Ghost to
find you

Nia steps between Robin and Ben

NIA
Ben you can use my flashlight if
you want It’s a Mag-lite so
it’s pretty much the best

BEN (0S)
(no thanks)
Yeah maybe later

NIA
Okay

We catch Robin giggle at Nia’s desperate fail just before Ben

turns off the light
CLICK

FEMALE SCREAM --

EXT TREE STUMP - NIGHT

-- the light comes in on a MUTILATED RODENT Its
back and much of its fur removed

ROBIN
Kramer Bad dog

AMELIA
How do you know it was Kramer

ROBIN
He was barking at it when we were

playing
(MORE)

TO BLACK

head twisted

ROBIN (contd)
(to Kramer)
Bad boy

CHRIS
One time my dog Sprinkles caught
a bird out of thin air and
swallowed it whole

(beat)

Sprinkles is 400lbs He can barely
get off his ass to play fetch But
if there’s food within six feet of
his mouth all the sudden he’s Kobe
fuckin’ Bryant

ROBIN
Feel like we should have a burial
for it or something

BEN (0S)
Yeah we could find that old church
in the woods and hold a service

CHRIS
(problem solved)
Here

Chris lifts a GIANT ROCK and drops it on the dead rodent

AMELIA
Fuck Chris Could you be anymore
insensitive

CHRIS
Hundreds of people have died here
and you’re mourning the life of the
dead squirrel

(beat)

I’m beginning to think you guys
aren’t taking this haunted forest
shit seriously

As Chris preaches to an unsympathetic audience Ben sets
Robins FLASHLIGHT onto the toppled tree He then sits on the
stump facing the light while Robin ties the BLINDFOLD around
his face The others casually disappear into the background

ROBIN
I heard you’re the best at
“Nightlight”

BEN
Well I’m only as good as my
flashlight

ROBIN
Then you’re welcome

Kramer hugs the forest floor still suspicious of the
FLASHLIGHT

BEN
So Robin
(beat)
I’m glad you came tonight We
should hang more often you know
Silence
BEN
(awkward)
Did you say something

They’re gone Ben quietly counts to himself “One one-
thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand etc”

Kramer makes a noise - a slight whimper A SIMILAR NOISE IS
HEARD FROM THE WOODS

Again the foliage in the foreground subtly leans into the
light

Kramer stiffens tail between its legs
The wind picks up The temperature drops Fast
KRAMER PEES ON HIMSELF

He then hides behind the tree he’s tied to occasionally
peering back at the light

A BRANCH SNAPS IN THE WOODS Ben’s head flicks up He removes
the blindfold

He listens

There are noises all around Wood SPLINTERING and BREAKING A
flock of CROWS screeching

THE FLASHLIGHT RATTLES in a micro almost imperceptible
manner

BEN
(to Kramer)
Did you see that

Dust particles begin levitating in front of the lens It’s
almost beautiful

Ben approaches the light with caution and awe
The dust dissipates as abruptly as it congregated
He picks up the flashlight and stares into the bulb He spits
on the lens and wipes it clean with his sleeve Then aims the
light into the forest Nothing unusual
BEN (0S)
(softly)

I love this game

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Moments later Ben creeping through the forest in stealth
mode Maybe taking the game a little too seriously

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Later still The light is focused intently on dense brush We
approach quietly as if hunting something hidden

BEN (0S)
Shit

Ben slowly reaches into the thicket

BEN (0S)
No way

He PLUCKS something from within the bush
BEN (0S)
(singing to himself)
“because I got high because I
got high”
He pulls out a MARIJUANA LEAF

BEN (0S)

Ben marvels at his find before going back in Deeper this
time His hand blindly sweeps the forest floor

SHINK Ben’s hand retracts as a METAL TRAP snaps closed where
his hand used to be

BEN (0S)
SHIT
Ben composes himself as he inspects the steel jaw trap
BEN (0S)
Covington potheads don’t fuck

around

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST — NIGHT
Later Ben pounces around a tree

BEN (0S)
Gotcha

No one’s there HE HEARS SOMETHING

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT
Close on Amelia’s SCREAMING face right as Ben finds her

AMELIA
(disbelief)
I’m the first and I had this bad-
ass hiding spot

BEN (0S)
Youre hiding in poison ivy

AMELIA

(playing it off)
I know

She unconsciously scratches her arms

BEN (0S)
This is a terrible hiding spot

AMELIA
Youre a “terrible hiding spot”

Amelia starts to head back to the stump but stops
AMELIA

Nia didn’t say anything to you
about this did she

BEN (0S)
This

AMELIA
Nia

BEN (0S)

About what
Amelia takes a long beat

AMELIA
Nevermind

BEN (0S)
Good talk

Ben moves in the opposite direction

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

The light comes in on the “Covington Ghost” Sure enough
just luminescent moss growing in patches on a tree trunk

BEN (0S)
Boo

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Moments later Ben carves the finishing touches on his
addition to the “Covington Ghost”

“BEN WAS HERE”

He lowers his POCKET KNIFE and regards the tree which is
covered with vandalism from countless teens

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT
On the move Fast Breathing heavy

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Further Ben’s movement becomes more erratic less strategic
Is he still looking for his friends Or is he running from
something

Faster

Faster

Faster

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Ben is frozen Everything is static everything is calm The
flashlight trained on the ground

He takes a few cautious steps forward until the beam of his
light reveals --
EXT RAVINE - NIGHT

-- the EDGE of a steep ravine Ben’s feet straddle the rim
his light looking down

Ben laughs relieved he found the ravine before it found him

BEN (0S)

(joking to himself)
Don’t do it Ben You’ve got a good
life

Ben slowly turns around Swallows a deep breath Then takes a
step --

SNAP THE LEDGE COLLAPSES UNDER HIS FEET HIS HANDS GO OUT AS
HE FALLS HE GRABS THE EARTH AS IT SLAMS INTO HIS ARMS

THE FLASHLIGHT LANDS ON THE BROKEN LEDGE AS BEN DISAPPEARS
DOWN THE RAVINE

WE HEAR SOUNDS OF VIOLENT CRACKS AND SNAPS ALL THE WAY DOWN
UNTIL --

SILENCE
We hold for what feels like forever

THROUGH THE SETTLING DUST

TWO RED ORBS APPEAR FLOATING IN UNISON GETTING CLOSER

We hear RAW PANIC in the faint sound of voices calling for
Ben His friends must have heard the fall

The orbs rock back and forth side to side in a threatening
manner

THE WIND PICKS UP

The orbs move into the pool of light before us and we
realize they are RACCOON EYES reflecting the flashlight

The creature is eerily drawn to the light

DISTANT VOICES (0S)
Ben

The raccoon scurries into the shadows as two beams of light
happen upon us It’s Robin and Nia

ROBIN
Oh my god Ben

NIA
Ben

Robin lifts her FLASHLIGHT off the ground and rakes the
ravine Patches of broken land scattered below

BEN IS GONE

They were expecting an unconscious body perhaps paralyzed
from the fall

ROBIN (0S)

Ben
NIA
Ben
NOTHING
ROBIN (0S) NIA
Did it sound like he fell What are we supposed to do

ROBIN (0S)
What did you see --

-- SCREAMS reverberate through the trees Robin turns the
light on Nia who is suddenly pale and clawing at her sleeves

ROBIN (0S)
Did you hear that

NIA

ROBIN (0S)
Let’s go

NIA
Hear what

ROBIN (0S)
(pleading)
Nia

NIA
Where’s Ben

ROBIN (0S)

What
NIA ROBIN (0S)
I’m waiting for Ben What was that scream
NIA ROBIN (0S)
I don’t know --did you hear it

NIA
I’m waiting for Ben to come back

ROBIN (0S) NIA
Come back from where I’m staying here

Nia kneels down and wraps her arms around her legs like a
child

ROBIN (0S)
Let’s look a little further
because --

NIA
-- you’re jealous Ben likes me

ROBIN (0S)
Nia you can have him I just want
to make sure everyone’s okay

NIA
Why wouldn’t everyone be okay
You don’t actually believe those
stupid stories do you

ROBIN (0S)
Hell no

Robin steps into the forest There’s a path that seems to
lead safely down the ravine

NIA
Robin
(beat)
Did you really know that boy who
died here

This stops Robin cold

ROBIN (0S)
His name was Ethan

NIA
I know
(oddly sympathetic)
Must be hard being here because
Ethan was your friend

ROBIN (0S)
(lying)
Doesn’t matter

Robin snaps on the BLUE COLEMAN and places it on a bed of
leaves in front of Nia creating a beacon

ROBIN (0S)
I’m leaving Ben’s light so I can
find my way back

Nia shifts around uncomfortable with sounding “sympathetic”
She switches back to “bitch”

NIA
Good for you

ROBIN (0S)
You have to wait for me because I
don’t know how to get out of the
woods from here

NIA
Well see

ROBIN (0S)
I’m serious

NIA
Okay

ROBIN (0S)
I’m serious

NIA
Okay

ROBIN (0S)
Okay

NIA
OKAY

ROBIN (0S)
Thank you

Nia waits by the BLUE COLEMAN as Robin forges ahead

EXT RAVINE PATH - NIGHT
Robin maneuvers down a slight incline

ROBIN (0S)
Ben Is everything cool

She scans the trees

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT HORSESHOE-SHAPED TREE - NIGHT

A little further Robin commits passing landmarks to memory
as to avoid getting lost

ROBIN (0S)
(to herself)
Horseshoe-shaped tree

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT RED BERRY PATCH - NIGHT
Further still
ROBIN (0S)
(to herself)
-red berry patch

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT ROTTING TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

Even further

ROBIN (0S)
(to herself)
rotting tree house

After several moments Robin stops and looks back She can’t
see the light from the blue Coleman anymore

ROBIN (0S)
Nia

Her voice echoes She listens
ROBIN (0S)
(louder )

Nia

There’s a long SILENCE

NIA
(distant yell)
What
ROBIN (0S)
Nothing

Robin turns

THERE IS SUDDEN MOVEMENT AHEAD LEAVES AND BRANCHES SNAP AS
WE SEE FIFTY FEET AWAY A DARK FORM STRIDE INTO THE
THICKNESS OF THE FOREST

EXT COMPACT CLIFF - NIGHT

Robin pursues the form to a thick rock wall The light
reflects off a dangling ORANGE CLIMBING ROPE as a sheet of
dust trickles to the ground It’s as if someone or something
just scurried over the ridge

ROBIN (0S)
Ben you found us It’s over

Robin examines the rope COVINGTON COUNTY RESCUE DEPARTMENT

She grabs the rope and wedges her foot into a split in the
wall

There’s a BLACK BOULDER hanging over our heads at the top of
the ridge Robin climbs toward the boulder One step at a
time

AND THEN WE HEAR IT THE SOUND CARRIES THROUGH THE AIR AND
BLEEDS INTO THE WIND

IT IS NOT HUMAN IT IS LIKE A SIREN ROARING FROM ALL
DIRECTIONS
Robin steadies herself
Her light examines the forest below It is calm
THE SIREN SLOWLY STARTS TO MOVE AWAY
ROBIN (0S)

Ben I can’t climb this thing so

just come out
Robin steps higher Her foot gets tangled in a THICKET OF
VINES She tries to wrestle free her weight tugging on the
rope
PEBBLES roll off the BLACK BOULDER

Robin clenches shielding herself from the raining dust

She removes her SIX FLAGS PHOTO KEY-CHAIN from her pocket and
carefully uses the KEYS to cut the vines around her foot

Her weight shifts pulling on the ROPE
THE BLACK BOULDER MOVES
Robin realizes THE ROPE IS TIED TO THE BOULDER

She continues to cut as fast as she can The rope pulls the
giant rock to the edge of the ridge

THE SIREN ROARS AGAIN
Robin drops the KEY CHAIN to the ground

ROBIN (0S)
shit

THE SIREN FADES

Robin’s light illuminates the ground searching for the KEYS
-- A DEER CHARGES THROUGH FRAME

ROBIN SCREAMS THEN SLIPS

The FLASHLIGHT falls and thuds against the ground
highlighting the KEY-CHAIN in the foreground

Robin’s feet land nearby She steals a glance at the
flashlight

BOOM
THE BLACK BOULDER LANDS HARD CRUSHING THE KEY-CHAIN

Robin’s arms wrap around the boulder She summons all her
strength to roll it over

She immediately picks up the light and examines the CRACKED
KEY-CHAIN with reverence knowing it could’ve been her

We see the key-chain PICTURE clearly for the first time A
YOUNG ROBIN rides a roller coaster with a BOY (ETHAN)
They look happy

Robin starts to back track

We know she’s scared because she freezes Her eyes must be
zeroing in on a detail that we can’t quite see

THERE’S SOMETHING ON ONE OF THE TREES

Robin approaches a bare tree trunk that has been SLASHED with
an UPSIDE DOWN CROSS She pans her light left

THERE’S ANOTHER SLASHED TREE TRUNK
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER
AND ANOTHER

Below each of these trees there is a WHITE WOODEN CROSS
stabbed into the ground

Robin tries stepping past the marked trees
HER FLASHLIGHT BEGINS FLICKERING

ROBIN (0S)
ee NO

She steps back and her light returns to normal

She tries to pass again and again her FLASHLIGHT
FLICKERS nearly dying

ROBIN (0S)

Nia
SILENCE
ROBIN (0S)
(louder )
Nia I found Ben
(beat)

(MORE)

ROBIN (0S) (contd)
I’m giving him a blow job you
better come out and stop me

Still nothing Seemingly unable to pass the trees without her
light faltering Robin arcs around back into the forest

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

But where is the HORSESHOE-SHAPED TREE RED BERRY PATCH or
ROTTING TREE-HOUSE All the familiar landmarks she made sure
to remember along the way are gone

RIGHT TOWARD US --

A BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT OPENS A DOOR IN THE DARKNESS

ROBIN (0S)
Jesus Nia you scared me

Robin moves ultra-cautiously toward the light A tangle of
branches from two intersecting pine trees slows her

The light holds steady ominously looking into us
She makes it a few feet before stumbling over a tree root
THE LIGHT ECLIPSES TO BLACK

ROBIN (0S)
Nia

Robin catches her balance The light reappears thirty feet
back If it is indeed a flashlight it would’ve been
impossible for someone to move away so quickly

ROBIN (0S)
Nia

The light starts moving in long-fast strides away from Robin

She chases the phantom light which seems to appear and
disappear in equal measure

The closer Robin gets the farther the light moves

-until it DISAPPEARS ALTOGETHER leaving Robin stranded
even deeper in the woods

ROBIN (0S)
Guys Stop fucking around I’m
lost
(silence)
Help

THE LIGHT REAPPEARS
Robin slides down a gravel bank in pursuit

At the bottom of the bank there is a horizontal sinkhole
ripped into the Earth The light refracts out of this sliver
of an opening

ROBIN (0S)
(truly scared)
I want to leave

The closer we get to the hole the bigger it appears What
once looked ten inches wide is now ten feet wide
INT CAVE MOUTH - NIGHT

Robin lowers herself into the mouth of the cave which levels
off into a shallow downward slope

Water drips along the rocks and cracks of the corridor
flowing to the cavern floor Robin follows this running
water as the cave tunnel fluctuates in size and shape

The phantom light flares out again forging shadows on the
walls from the stalactites and stalagmites

ROBIN (0S)

If I don’t show up for work
tomorrow my boss is gonna fire me

(listening)
That’s right my boss at Ben and
Jerrys where I scoop ice-cream
because I’m a fucking loser whose
parents don’t pay for everything

“everything everything” Her voice reverberates off the
walls and then it gets silent

All we hear is the dripping of water
And Robin’s manic breathing
And a cold wind

A rock CLATTERS to the ground Robin turns to make sure she’s
not being followed

Empty

Up ahead the color of rock turns deep iron red where a
narrow fissure resides at the top of a small scree

There are vivid SCRATCH MARKS along the wall leading up
It’s the only passage through

THE WIND INSIDE HAS A VOICE-LIKE QUALITY IT’S AS IF TWO
VOICES ARE WHISPERING IN CONVERSATION

ROBIN (0S)
I can hear you guys

THE SOUNDS CONTINUE THEY BECOME SHORTER AND FASTER HARDER
ANGRIER

ROBIN (0S)

If you want to make fun of me
make fun of me to my face

INT CAVE FISSURE - NIGHT

Robin climbs the scree and edges into the fissure The
SCRATCH MARKS are more intense inside

As the rocks wrench inward the cave gets smaller and
smaller and smaller --

Until Robin must slump then crawl through mud and ice into
this tight passage

THE LIGHT FLASHES AGAIN Three feet away Just for a second
ROBIN (0S)
(softly)
Guys
Robin crawls head first through this suffocating passageway
barely big enough to move contorting herself along the way

until she reaches a shallow pool of muddy water

ROBIN (0S)
I can’t hear you What did you say

THE WHISPERING VOICES ARE GETTING CLOSER

ROBIN (0S)
What

She dips her head and flashlight and crawls through the
shallow pool We barely push through and out into a tiny
chamber that is clearly a DEAD END

Robin gasps

The cave is empty

With the exception of a BLUE COLEMAN FLASHLIGHT sitting alone
in a puddle of mud

Robin starts to hyperventilate She feels the cave walls that
are marked with deep scratches looking for a secret
passageway but there’s nothing - absolutely no way anyone
could have crawled out of the cave without Robin seeing them

She turns back into the fissure head first but it seems
smaller than before The ceiling holds her in place

ROBIN (0S)
-no come on

Robin wriggles back into the chamber

THE SIREN FROM OUTSIDE ROARS AGAIN The sound is even more
ominous now perverted and amplified by the cave’s acoustics

This time Robin crawls into the fissure feet first
flashlight facing the chamber hoping she can get out the
exact way she got in
THE COLEMAN EERILY STROBES IN THE BACKGROUND
ROBIN (0S)
(screaming)
HELP ME

Robin awakes a NEST OF BATS The creatures fly right up to
the lens before averting contact Robin SCREAMS

She contorts her arm and submerges her head in the water to
maneuver through

She gurgles and coughs Almost drowns Before sliding out
The cave opens up wide enough for her to crawl then stand

Caught up in the ecstacy of freedom Robin’s hand carelessly
smacks against the lip of the fissure’s exit

The flashlight rolls down the scree and drops into a crack in
the cave floor

A plume of dust clouds the lens
The sound is different in this crevice There’s a looming
bass and the shadows in the foreground suggest a

supernatural presence

Robin’s hand dips into the hole The dust dissipates as she
feels around for her light

In the background etched into the rock we see something
Robin can’t
“ETHAN WAS HERE”

Robin snatches up the light

EXT FOREST - NIGHT
MOVING FAST --
The world shakes as we leave behind the cave at top speed

HUNDREDS OF CICADAS FILL THE AIR WITH A HIGH PITCHED SCREAM
THE SOUND GROWS UNNATURALLY LOUD

Robin tries to steady the flashlight focusing momentarily as
she passes the --
EXT ROTTING TREE HOUSE - NIGHT
ROBIN (0S)
Tree house
EXT RED BERRY PATCH - NIGHT
ROBIN (0S)
-berries
EXT HORSESHOE-SHAPED TREE

ROBIN (0S)
-horseshoe tree

Robin has found her way back

EVERY INSECT IN THE FOREST GETS DEADLY SILENT A PREDATOR
MUST BE NEAR

ROBIN (0S)
Kramer

Robin’s dog steps out of the shadows GROWLING

ROBIN (0S)
How did you get over here

Kramer’s anger turns to fear the closer she gets Her own dog
doesn’t recognize her

ROBIN (0S)
What’s wrong with you It’s me

Kramer rears up then sprints Robin chases through a
corridor of gnarled tree-trunks

Leaves whipping past at a dizzying speed branches are
dodged fallen trees are jumped We’re gaining on him

ROBIN (0S)
Kramer

SHINK
ROBIN SCREAMS
KRAMER DISAPPEARS

THE FLASHLIGHT FALLS

WE SEE --

The patches of Marijuana crop surrounding the METAL TRAP that
has closed around Robin’s ankle

She stumbles out of frame giving us front row seats to the
bloody mess that ensues as she pries the metal jaws off her
leg in the foreground

Robin discards the trap and rolls up her pant leg revealing
a small ANKLE BRACE now broken in half blood seeping
through The brace prevented any permanent damage

She picks up her FLASHLIGHT and stands

The forest has turned to shadows and black

SOMETHING IN THE TREES MOVES Branches and shrubs whip and
snap in the distance The sound is getting closer

Robin pans her light around the forest SOMETHING’S COMING
RIGHT AT HER Left Then right

ROBIN (0S)
Kramer please

Closer
Closer
Closer

Robin turns in time to see CHRIS blow past He’s out of
breath and terrified barely able to whimper a warning

CHRIS
Run

Robin runs As fast as she can But her damaged ankle is
slowing her down Chris is losing her It’s too painful

ROBIN (0S)
Chris wait

Chris disappears ahead

ROBIN (0S)
My leg

As Robin slows to a limp her light discovers something
partially obscured by tall grass She stops long enough to
see --

IT IS A HUMAN LEG

She sprints twenty feet ahead and hides behind a tree

Her light examines her own bleeding ankle then peers back
toward the obscured leg

Robin takes a few breaths soothing her nerves She studies
the surrounding trees The forest is calm It feels safe As
safe as it gets

Robin backtracks to the tall grass

Her light discovers an unconscious NIA

Robin shines the light in Nia’s face Then checks her
surroundings one last time All clear

ROBIN (0S)
(whispering)
Wake up
Robin shakes her
ROBIN (0S)
(whispering)
We have to go

Nia is comatose

ROBIN (0S)
Nia

Robin sets down her FLASHLIGHT using it to light the path
ahead She then drags Nia eight feet into the darkness

She picks up the FLASHLIGHT again walks to Nia sets the
FLASHLIGHT down and drags her eight more feet

As this action transpires there’s something in the darkness
behind Robin and Nia that’s frightening Subliminal
illusions A knotted tree that looks like a face Shadows
that bend and shift in anomalous ways

Robin picks up her FLASHLIGHT for a third time and walks back
to Nia She notices something SHINY has fallen from Nia’s
pocket

It’s a DIGITAL CAMERA Robin aims her light at the view
screen and flicks through the recent pictures

IMGO279 -- Amelia peeing in a bush annoyed

IMGO276 -- Robin blindfolded on the stump

IMGO275 -- Chris mock-humping Ben from behind

IMGO272 -- Self portrait of Nia posing with duck lips

IMGO270 -- Amelia getting felt up during THE NERVOUS GAME

She stands sheepishly on the stump trying to look sexy but
really it’s just awkward She gives a quick bra flash as she
spews

ROBIN

“Tm a Greek Statue I’m a Greek
Statue I’m a Greek Statue”

The video ends Robin clicks MENU A box opens “Would you

IMGO266 -- Kramer stuck in the fence

IMGO262 -- Amelia and Nia standing outside a WHITE BEAMER at

eating Taco Bell and blasting top 40s on the radio

AMELIA

admit she got an after school job
because she’s fucking insecure

AMELIA

The video ends “Would you like to delete VID0002”

NIA (0S)

(groggy )
--what happened

Robin quickly hides the camera in her pocket and turns to Nia
who is just waking

ROBIN (0S)
Are you okay

Nia holds out her hand It tremors She tries to steady it
but can’t

NIA
What’s wrong with me

ROBIN (0S)
What do you mean

NIA
My skin burns

Nia pinches her index finger to her thumb A SHOCK ZAPS
between her fingers

ROBIN (0S)
We need to go I hurt my leg and I
don’t feel safe here --

NIA
-- why did you leave me

ROBIN (0S)
Why did I leave you What’re you
talking about What have you been
doing for the past hour

Nia flicks the switch on her FLASHLIGHT but nothing happens
HER BATTERIES ARE DEAD Robin helps her stand

NIA
You yelled my name I don’t
remember after that I was
waiting

ROBIN (0S)
Nia this isn’t where I left you

NIA
I don’t know --

ROBIN (0S)
-- how did you get here

NIA

ROBIN (0S)
Chris seemed scared he told me to
run

NIA
Forget what Chris says

ROBIN (0S)
What does that mean

NIA
I don’t know let’s just leave

ROBIN (0S)
We can’t leave because I don’t
know where the fuck we are
Nia looks around a moment She starts walking

NIA
This way

Robin’s light finds a SILVER CANISTER on the ground as
continues walking ahead

NIA
Robin I think I see it

Robin lifts what appears to be an AIR HORN

NIA
Did you drive a truck You know
uh I I don’t think it’s too far
away
(beat)
Robin

THE AIR HORN’S CASING IS BRAND NEW

ROBIN (0S)
(to herself)
This is the sound I heard

NIA
Did you hear me I know where your
truck is

ROBIN (0S)
(to herself)
They bought this to scare me

NIA

Robin looks up to Nia
ROBIN (0S)
You invited me here to make fun of

ROBIN (0S)
Don’t lie

NIA

ROBIN (0S)

Nia

NIA
What are you saying Because you

mart

ROBIN STOPS COLD

ROBIN (0S)

NIA

Robin’s light pans back down to the AIR HORN where a STICKER
reads 799 WAL-MART

ROBIN (0S)
You bought this

NIA
You’re scaring me right now

ROBIN (0S)
It’s yours

NIA
Robin

ROBIN (0S)

ROBIN (0S)
Get away from me

NIA

Robin buckles then sits She examines her ankle The
bleeding has stopped

ROBIN (0S)
I’m not with you

Nia leans into Robin pleading

NIA
We’ll just leave let’s just go

ROBIN (0S)
GET AWAY FROM ME

NIA
Robin I don’t feel good

Nia backs away then sits across from Robin her back against
a THICK MAPLE TREE

ROBIN (0S)
I was nice to you

NIA
I don’t know what’s going on I’m
sick I just want to leave

ROBIN (0S)
I don’t want to be friends with you
or your stupid group anymore

Nia smacks her FLASHLIGHT trying to get it to work but it’s
no use

NIA
Robin we’re almost to your truck
My flashlight’s dead I can’t go
by myself I’m scared

ROBIN (0S)
(to everyone)
THEN YOUR DUMB FUCKING FRIENDS WILL
HAVE TO COME OUT OF HIDING AND
APOLOGIZE TO ME

NIA
(softly)
---don’t make me go by myself

ROBIN (0S)

CAUSE I’M NOT WALKING ANY
FURTHER JUST SO THEY CAN JUMP OUT
AND YELL “BOO”

NIA
I said I’m scared

Nia wipes a tear from her eye Robin tilts her light down to
the ground

ROBIN (0S)
I said Fuck You

CLICK TO BLACK

LONG HOLD ON BLACK

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

The light comes back on A lot of time has passed We can
tell from the layer of FROST now covering the ground

Robin tilts the light to Nia who’s asleep against the maple
ROBIN (0S)
(shivers)

Nia

The light continues up along the tree Carved over twenty
times into the bark

“NIA WAS HERE”

Robin crawls over to Nia and shakes her She’s comatose Her
lips are purple and blistered Her face is blue

Robin picks at the eerie carvings in the tree before turning
her attention back to Nia

Clenched in Nia’s fist is Robin’s CRACKED SIX FLAGS KEY CHAIN
(it’s what Nia used to carve with)

Robin takes back her key chain then pulls Nia’s eyelids
open

Her eyes are rolled back in her head and we only see the
whites of her sclera

ROBIN (0S) (CONTD)
you passed out again

SUDDENLY NIA’S EYES FLICK DOWN STARRING RIGHT INTO THE
LIGHT ROBIN PULLS BACK AND STIFLES A SCREAM WITH HER OWN
HANDS NIA’S EYES HOLD LIFELESS IT’S UNNERVING

ROBIN (0S) (CONTD)
Nia I can’t feel my leg

Nia blinks suddenly conscious
NIA
(dazed)

Where are we

ROBIN (0S)
Covington

Robin stands then helps Nia stand

NIA
How long have we been here
ROBIN (0S)
I don’t know Since ten

NIA
No I mean right here

ROBIN (0S)
An hour Maybe more They left
without us

The girls start walking

NIA
Maybe we should try the church

ROBIN (0S)
(deflecting)
Where did you see my truck

NIA
Isn’t that where we’re supposed to
meet if we get separated The old
church

ROBIN (0S)
(deflecting)
I think you were pointing this way

NIA
Robin They’re at the church

Robin stops turning the light back to Nia

ROBIN (0S)

No

NIA
That’s where they’re at I’m
serious

ROBIN (0S)
I want to find my truck and get the
hell out of here
(beat)
I can’t believe they left us

Walking Silence

NIA
Ben’s not so great you know
(beat)
I don’t know why we like him

ROBIN (0S)

More walking More silence

NIA
If I tell you an embarrassing dance
story you have to tell me an
embarrassing dance story

ROBIN (0S)
Huh Okay

NIA
I asked Ben to “Turnabout” last
year He said “Yes” I didn’t sleep
for a week Bought a dress and
heels Bragged to all my friends
Posted a countdown on Facebook

ROBIN (0S)
I think I remember seeing that

NIA

And then he stood me up And I
never said anything to him about
it because I didn’t want to look
desperate or hurt We both just
acted like it never happened

(beat)
Just because Ben’s important to us
doesn’t mean we’re important to
him

Robin is moved She doesn’t know what to say She may have
misjudged this girl

ROBIN (0S)
(beat)
Did you really masturbate to the
Grinch

NIA
Guess I’ve always had questionable
taste in men

Robin laughs for the first time in awhile

EXT OVERGROWN PATH - NIGHT

The girls have found a thin overgrown deer-trail marked with
a WHITE CROSS Robin’s flashlight starts FLICKERING again

ROBIN (0S)
Shit

NIA
Why didn’t you take those batteries
from Chris
ROBIN (0S)
-because I don’t take anything
from Chris
Robin fumbles with the light
WE FLICKER IN AND OUT OF DARKNESS
She slaps it
THE BEAM STEADIES

NIA
Can I try something

Nia takes the FLASHLIGHT and rubs her sweater against the
shaft to create friction

NIA (0S)
Helps the battery life if you keep
it warm

Robin nods We glimpse her in full for the first time in
awhile Pale and vulnerable

NIA (0S)
Jesus Christ

Nia stops rubbing It’s as if she’s been pricked with an
adrenaline shot

ROBIN
What

NIA (0S)
Fuck fuck

ROBIN
What

NIA (0S)
FUCK

ROBIN

What is it

NIA (0S)

Your flashlight says “Ethan” on it
ROBIN

(so)

Yeah
NIA (0S)

Don’t say it --
ROBIN

-- was his
NIA (0S)

How could you bring this here
knowing what happened to him you
stupid bitch

ROBIN
Because I stopped believing in
Santa Claus when I was three

NIA (0S)

You brought the flashlight of your
deceased friend into the haunted
forest where he mysteriously died
This is not a rational decision

ROBIN
Neither is fingering yourself to
the Grinch but here we are

NIA (0S)

(utter disbelief)
You fucked us You know that right
There’s real Exorcist shit going
on and we’re fucked because of
your ridiculous idea that life is
simple and what you see is what you
get --

ROBIN
(building anger)

-- yes because I didn’t have a BMW
magically appear in my driveway for
my sweet sixteen And the tooth
fairy didn’t bring me Lady Gaga
tickets when I lost a molar I live
in the real world Nia where
“magic” is what nerds play on
Saturday nights and what Chris
Angel does for easy blow jobs

NIA (0S)
It’s not my fault my parents are
wealthy If anything it’s a stigma
I have to overcome

ROBIN
Oh please

NIA (0S)
(realizing)
Oh no and I’m touching it I’m
holding it Fuck my life
(beat)
I’m still holding it

ROBIN
Fine give it back

Robin grabs the light Right then with their hands both
touching the FLASHLIGHT a HARSH SPOTLIGHT FROM OVERHEAD
BLANKETS THE GIRLS

ROBIN (0S)
(truly scared)
Ohhhh shit

They look up The light is coming from a tall LAMP POST
buried in the trees It has no discernible power source

NIA
Did that just turn on because we

ROBIN (0S)
no It has motion sensors

The girls scrutinize the LAMP POST It’s a tall thin post
with a naked LIGHT BULB recessed into a TIN WRAP

NIA
But it’s just a wooden post
There’s no electricity running into
it

ROBIN (0S)
How do you know there’s no
electricity running into it Let’s
be thankful the scientific method
isn’t based on intuition

The girls continue walking Nia discreetly clasps her hands

NIA
(softly to herself)
Lord Jesus I don’t talk to you
often as you well know but please
watch over me --

ROBIN (0S)
Are you kidding

NIA
(softly to herself)
-- I mean us --

ROBIN (0S)
Don’t bring me into this

Once they are ten feet removed the LAMP POST TURNS OFF Nia
gives Robin a look of “See”

ROBIN (0S)
(uncertain)
it’s just motion sensors

A SECOND LAMP POST TURNS ON This time the girls don’t stop
moving

NIA
(softly to herself)
Also I would like to ask
forgiveness for my sins whatever
they may be

Behind them the SECOND LAMP POST TURNS OFF right as a THIRD
LAMP ignites above them It’s as if their proximity has
powered each makeshift lamp which appear to be built every
10-15 feet along the deer-trail

Nia starts to steeple her hands once more but Robin grabs her
arm in time to stop her

ROBIN (0S)
That’s enough Maybe this is a good
thing you know Maybe we’re
getting out of here
THE THIRD LAMP TURNS OFF
A FOURTH LAMP IGNITES
THEN DISAPPEARS as they pass

Robin notices Nia searching her pockets frantically

NIA
I think we gotta go back

ROBIN (0S)
That’s a horrible idea

NIA
No I can’t find my camera

ROBIN (0S)
Who cares

NIA
It’s got a strong flash we can use
to light the woods

ROBIN (0S)
We’re not going back

NIA
We don’t want to be anywhere near
these lights and I feel like if
your flashlight dies
Nia glances back at where they came from

NIA
fuuuuuck

Behind them in the darkness we can barely see the FIRST LAMP
LIGHT UP as if someone or something has triggered it

They watch in silence
LAMP ONE disappears
Long beat

LAMP TWO lights up
Long beat

LAMP TWO disappears

Long beat

LAMP THREE lights up

ROBIN (0S)
(scared)
Dear God I don’t believe in
you but if there’s any validity to
your existence and this reaches you
telepathically or otherwise then
(MORE)

ROBIN (0S) (contd)
we would appreciate some serious
consideration right now Love
Robin

LAMP THREE disappears

LAMP FOUR lights up
The light in the lamp lingers
NO ONE IS THERE
The tension is unbearable
Robin’s trembling hand lifts the AIR HORN into frame
NIA
(whispers )
Robin what’re you doing

She BLASTS it Nia covers her ears
The scream of the horn is followed only by DEAFENING SILENCE
And then

The WIND ROARS as if responding directly to Robin’s tantrum

The girls start moving as the forest keeps reacting Branches
in the distance seem to collapse on command

ROBIN (0S)
Oh my god

Our world shakes as Robin and Nia break out into a delirious
sprint

EXT DENSE FOREST - NIGHT

Robin puts her hand out to protect her face and eyes running
as fast as she can There is something coming behind them
SHE HEARS BRANCHES BREAKING

Her hand slams into a tree she CRIES OUT IN PAIN We catch a
glimpse of Nia who is lagging behind Robin skirts around the
tree and keeps moving

Her light FLICKERS

She cuts left

IT STOPS FLICKERING It’s as if the light is guiding her

Another tree catches Robin’s arm She almost falls before
gathering her balance She keeps running

She stumbles into a clearing out of breath and panting The
wind calms

Robin realizes there are WHITE CROSSES all around her

ROBIN (0S)
(confessing)
Nia I I have your camera
(beat)
I heard what you said about me
and I want you to know in case
something happens I forgive you

No response She’s alone Robin backtracks to find Nia lying
UNCONSCIOUS on the forest floor

Robin unfastens a SAFETY PIN from her jeans and raises the
needle to Nia’s arm

ROBIN (0S)
(almost crying)
Stop faking

Robin PRICKS Nia with the pin Blood trickles out

ROBIN (0S)
(no voice)
It’s not funny

Robin pricks Nia again Nothing Nia won’t wake

Scared and confused Robin sets her FLASHLIGHT on the ground
and crawls into frame She lifts Nia and drags her back
against a tree She then rests her head tenderly on Nia’s
shoulder Exhausted She’s got nothing left Long beat

ROBIN
So here’s my embarrassing dance
story

A tear rolls down Robin’s cheek She wipes it away

ROBIN
Sophomore year my friend Ethan
asked me to “Homecoming” And even
though we had a lot in common I
was tired of being “the smart girl”
who socialized with “the uncool” I
wanted to be pretty and popular I
wanted to be you

(beat)
(MORE)

ROBIN (contd)

So I told Ethan that I couldn’t go
because I was out of his league and
that he shouldn’t have even asked
It was the first time I ever acted
like a total bitch and I remember
thinking to myself “Wow When did
you get so cool”
(beat)
That night Ethan came to
Covington alone with nothing
other than this flashlight hiked
to the top of the Crest and
jumped

(beat)
Soon as I heard I knew it was
because of me I felt so guilty
that I came to Covington and tied a
rope to one of the trees

(beat)
But when I put the rope around my
neck the branch snapped and I
fell That’s when I found his
flashlight I kept it asa
reminder

Robin takes Nia’s hand into hers
ROBIN
Ghosts and demons don’t kill
people
(beat)
People kill people
Grass and greenery reach toward the light

Long beat

Twigs and tendrils hanging off the tree subtly reach into
frame

As the branches bend and flex ever so slightly acorns begin
to fall rolling and piling in the foreground

Robin doesn’t notice

A DARK SHADOW ENTITY moves onto Nia It’s as if there’s a
figure in front of the flashlight its mass being projected
onto the tree in front of us But there is no one

SNAP A branch from above breaks

Robin flinches startled

BOOM Over a hundred ACORNS simultaneously drop to the
ground By the time Robin shields her head it’s already too
late

She looks around alert confused

The SHADOW ENTITY moves off of Nia Robin saw it out of the
corner of her eye

She watches it recess into the forest and freezes
momentarily assuring herself it’s nothing Robin brushes
some acorns off Nia’s comatose body Her hand grazes
something cold around Nia’s wrist She pulls Nia’s sleeve up

ROBIN
No

We can’t see what Robin’s looking at but whatever it is the
very sight of it has distressed her

ROBIN
Nia Goddamnit

Robin shakes Nia then hits her Angry Emotional

ROBIN
Why didn’t you tell me

Robin picks up the FLASHLIGHT and carries it over to Nia
aiming it at her wrist and we see a PINK LEATHER BAND that
holds a STAINLESS STEEL PLACQUE

It reads “DIABETIC”

Robin removes Nia’s MEDICAL BRACELET and reads the underside
of the plaque “ALERT Insulin Dependant”

ROBIN (0S)
Why didn’t you tell me Why didn’t
you tell me

Robin backs away from Nia maneuvering into the forest

ROBIN (0S)

(through sobs)
I’m gonna find the truck gonna get
help gonna find the truck and get
help and get help and get help
get help and get help and get
insulin get insulin fuck

(beat)
FUCK

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT DENSE FOREST - NIGHT
A little later ON THE MOVE through the forest
THE LIGHT FLICKERS

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT CREEK - NIGHT
Later still We hear the faint roar of rapids ahead
ROBIN (0S)
(no voice)
--thank God thank God thank God
The light finds the creek with the FALLEN TREE across it
It’s the same one from the beginning Robin must be getting
closer to her car
Unlike her timid crawl earlier Robin mounts the tree like a
balance beam edging across one step at a time doing her
very best not to look down

Something moves in the trees distracting Robin for a moment
She scans the canopy

ROBIN (0S)
(no voice)
Hello
»ethen looks back down
A BULLSNAKE moves around the trunk two feet ahead
Robin’s feet recoil in fear
The bullsnake rears up

Robin stumbles

WHAP Her body thuds hard against the trunk knocking the
wind out of her

She coughs

The snake hisses as if it’s going to strike
The FLASHLIGHT slipping

Slipping

Slipping

Slipping

SPLASH THE IMPACT IS SUDDEN AND EXPLOSIVE

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The creek pulls us downstream at breakneck We thrash about
trading views between cloudy mud below water and passing
landscape above

The flashlight SMACKS against a boulder

We spiral out The blurred image of a distant figure above
water materializes then disintegrates as --

Bubbles crystallize around us Robin’s screaming face
suddenly appears The bubbles expand and pop

A sudden concussive blast blows Robin away as we hit another
boulder

The FLASHLIGHT nosedives into the mud floor We scrape along
before being yanked back into the current

Robin’s flailing body passes She’s drowning

BOOM The back of her head clips a boulder and she goes limp
We collide with the same boulder As we TWIST and TILT we
catch fleeting glimpses of Robin’s unconscious body driving
aimlessly downstream

She’s knocked to one side then another then sinks to the
floor as we zoom overhead rushing towards an “L” shaped
bend

EXT CREEK - NIGHT

We wash onto a rock bed half submerged

Our vision strobes then holds

THE WATER WE REST IN TURNS RED

Robin is thrust into frame Her arms and hands purple She
vomits creek water Heaving and choking Dazed

She lifts the FLASHLIGHT and turns to the trees
ROBIN (0S)

(no voice)
No

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

The forest has grown up around an OLD PICKUP TRUCK locking
it in place as if it’s been waiting for Robin in this very
spot for years

ROBIN (0S)

(gasping)
No no no no no no No

Robin scrutinizes the familiarity of every detail of the
rotting truck striped hood blue trim personalized plate

INT PICKUP - NIGHT

She sits into the cab and examines the interior Stuffing has
been gutted from the seats by rodents The dash has warped
from the sun and rain The doors rusted beyond functionality

Robin checks her bleeding head in the REAR VIEW Then notices
the KEYS still wedged in the ignition

A MATCHING SIX FLAGS PHOTO KEY CHAIN DANGLING JUST BELOW THE
STEERING WHEEL

Robin takes the KEY CHAIN into her hand An identical picture
of her and a boy riding a roller coaster

THIS IS ETHAN’S TRUCK

ROBIN (0S)
(crying)
I didn’t want to be here Ethan I
never wanted to come back
(beat)
Why am I here

Robin dries her eyes Her attention moves from the key chain
to the GLOVE COMPARTMENT She gives it a half-hearted tug
The handle is STUCK

She turns back to the REAR VIEW Her head has stopped
bleeding In the mirror’s reflection we see her eyes flick
back to the glove compartment Thinking

Her fingers grip the handle She YANKS with great force
CLANK The door drops open Inside A HALF OPEN PACK OF
BATTERIES

ROBIN (0S)
Thank you Ethan

CLICK TO BLACK

The sound of metal threading being unscrewed THUNK THUNK

INT PICKUP - NIGHT

The tungsten filament sparks blue then dissolves into a beam
slightly more vibrant than before

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Robin walks to the front of the truck where a line of
knotted trees unusually close together form a wall between
her and the forest

The trees give off a subtle glow - maybe it’s the herbaceous
moss WHITE CROSS memorials are at the foot of each trunk
UPSIDE DOWN CROSSES are carved into the bark

She takes five steps forward THE LIGHT FLICKERS
UNCONTROLLABLY

Five more steps
BLACKOUT

Back on Two more steps
BLACKOUT

Back on She’s inches away from the trees The light
flickers then holds steady

ROBIN (0S)
(realizing)
it’s not the batteries

Robin takes out the digital camera It’s wet but still
working

She frames the forest beyond the wall of trees and snaps a
pic The FLASH explodes giving a fleeting view of the forest
that expires after a millisecond

Robin highlights the camera with her flashlight as IMG0280
appears on the display It’s a seemingly normal picture of
the woods at night if you exclude the orange orbs and flares
in the corner of the frame

FLASH Robin takes a second picture SOMETHING MOVES IN THE
TREES JUST AS THE FLASH EXPIRES

The display turns blue with an ERROR MESSAGE “Card Damage”
The camera defaults to DEMO MODE cycling through random
presets and features

Robin ejects the SD CARD dries it off then restarts the
camera The view screen refreshes She aims it at the woods

FLASH Another picture This time it worked Robin holds the
camera right up to the light until the view screen fills the
entire frame

IMGO282 confirms our collective fears A DARK FIGURE MAYBE
FIFTEEN FEET AHEAD IS HIDING BEHIND A TREE

Using the touch screen Robin flicks her fingers to enlarge
the picture of the figure We can’t quite tell what we’re
looking at but it seems like an arm and leg

She flicks her fingers again Digital artifacts and grain
distort the image It’s like zooming into an abstract
painting

ROBIN YELLS THERE’S A BLUR OF MOTION AS IF THE IMAGE IS
ALIVE

She jolts back and drops the camera

ROBIN (0S)
shit

She takes a beat then picks up the camera to confirm what
she just saw

But the camera is in DEMO MODE again

Robin slowly backs away to the pickup truck

She places the FLASHLIGHT on the hood aimed at the forest
We hear her open the driver side There’s a CLICK and a LOW

TONE then THUNK --

THE TRUCK’S HEADLIGHTS IMPOSE THEMSELVES OVER EVERY INCH OF
SEE-ABLE FOREST

No one is there

Robin steps into frame leaving the FLASHLIGHT behind on the
hood moving deeper into the forest than her dimming light
would allow We watch from the pickup as Robin gets further
and further into enveloping darkness

Everything gets calm and utterly still No ominous wind Or
swirling leaves No sirens or screams Everything is perfect
like a postcard

AND THEN THE HEADLIGHTS TURN OFF

Robin jumps her legs get weak turning seeing what we
cannot

A HAND REACHES INTO OUR PERIPHERAL AND STEALS THE FLASHLIGHT

Robin SCREAMS as someone or something runs away with our
point of view stranding Robin alone in the dark

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT DENSE FOREST - NIGHT

Running Darkness Heavy BREATHING consumes the sound-track
OUR WORLD SHAKES as our host rapidly moves through the trees

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT DEAD FOREST - NIGHT

The pace of our sprint slows to a light jog The trees around
us are all marked with deep cuts and bruised bark They are
short and have no leaves Most if not all posses an UPSIDE
DOWN CROSS either made of twigs or scratched into the trunk
WHITE CROSSES are scattered over the ground There is a
clearing ahead

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT OLD CHURCH - NIGHT

The pace of our jog slows to a walk Twenty feet away there
is a dilapidated CHURCH Painted in faded purple Two
stories but small in depth More like a hut than a
cathedral Water damage and wind has eroded the foundation
The wood walls are peeling and splintering

INT OLD CHURCH NARTHEX - NIGHT

We step into the withering domain There are TWO CLOSED DOORS
before us sealing off the nave of the church A sun faded
outline of where a large cross used to hang is stained
forever on the doors

THERE’S A CREAKING NOISE FROM THE CEILING
The light pans to find a frail staircase Shadows stretch

along the walls as the light rakes the banister and climbs
the stairs

INT OLD CHURCH ATTIC - NIGHT

Feathers and animal bones cover the floor of this mostly
empty space There’s a CRACKED MIRROR leaning against the far
wall

As we move toward it the reflection of the FLASHLIGHT
creates a diffraction pattern manifesting into a lens flare
that obscures the face of the approaching figure

The figure pauses in front of the mirror as if expecting
something The figure leans in close and we see that it is
CHRIS Right as --

AMELIA
Boo

AMELIA jumps out from behind the mirror Chris jumps The
MIRROR tips and smashes against the floor shattering into
hundreds of pieces

CHRIS (0S)
Shit

AMELIA
Oops

CHRIS (0S)
Damn I was gonna hide behind that
when Robin got here

AMELIA
Sorry

Chris sets down the FLASHLIGHT He and Amelia start scooping
the glass into piles Amelia pricks her finger on a shard

AMELIA
Owie careful

CHRIS
I got it

Amelia sits back examining her finger kissing it to make it
feel better

CHRIS
Nia’s still not here

Amelia shrugs her shoulders “I guess” She then fires up her
IPOD She puts one EARBUD in her ear and offers the other to
Chris

CHRIS
Well we’ve waited all night

Chris scoops one last pile of glass then leans back to
Amelia and places the EARBUD in his ear We can faintly hear
the high end of whatever MUSIC they’re listening to

CHRIS
After Robin finds us I think we
should call it

AMELIA
We should call it now before Robin
never talks to us again

CHRIS
Oh we’re too late

AMELIA
What do you mean

CHRIS
(laughing)
Robin does not find this funny

AMELIA
She might after she thinks about --

CHRIS
-- I saw her She is not laughing

AMELIA
Well then we’re done

CHRIS
Hell no Nia’s paying for my room
in Cabo for this shit

AMELIA
She’s not actually going to pay for
your room in Cabo That’s like a
thing people say You know like
“Tll give you a million dollars if
you pick me up Starbucks”

CHRIS
She seemed pretty serious --

AMELIA
-- she’s not serious And we’re
inviting Robin to Cabo after this
so I don’t feel disgusting

CHRIS
What for Nia’s right Robin is
fake as shit She grew boobs and
bought a new shirt and thought she
was cool

AMELIA
Nia’s only doing this because she
likes Ben and she’s threatened by
Robin

CHRIS
Okay Oprah

AMELIA
I’m just saying when Ben found me
I asked if he was in on Nia’s
prank and he looked at me like I
was insane Nia didn’t tell him
about it because she’s trying to
embarrass Robin in front of him

Chris looks to Amelia

CHRIS
Why’d you stop the music
AMELIA
I didn’t isn’t that how the song

ends

They look down to her IPOD which has shut itself off Chris’
attention moves from the IPOD to something else

CHRIS
Know what would be awesome If you
let me cop a feel

AMELIA
(offended)
What
(beat)
Only if you don’t tell anyone

CHRIS
Then what’s the point

AMELIA
Forget it

CHRIS
Alright I won’t say anythi --

AMELIA
-- shut up

CHRIS
What

WE HEAR MOVEMENT

AMELIA
whispering
Downstairs

CHRIS
whispering
Robin’s here

AMELIA
whispering
Turn off the light

CHRIS
whispering
Shit okay

Chris picks up the flashlight It swings around the room as
the two hunker down to hide

AMELIA
(whispering)
So what do we say Nightlight

CHRIS (0S)
(whispering)
Surprise

AMELIA
(whispering)
“Surprise We’re assholes” And
she’1l be like “That’s not a
surprise I already knew that”

CHRIS (0S)

(whispering)
Let’s just say “It was all Nia’s
idea”

(realizing)

Ha That sounds like a show with
puppets on Nickelodeon “NIA‘’S
IDEA”

AMELIA
(not amused)
Turn it off

CHRIS (0S)
(whispering)
I’m trying

We can hear Chris flick the switch on and off THE LIGHT WILL
NOT TURN OFF

AMELIA
(whispering)
Hurry she’s coming

CHRIS (0S)
(whispering)
It won’t go

AMELIA
(whispering)
Cover it

Out of our peripheral we catch Amelia unzip her JACKET She
slams the flashlight on the floor and drapes the jacket over
the light

ALL WE SEE IS FUZZY BLACK LINEN

The church GROANS and SETTLES
Silence
The front door GROANS as pressure is placed against it

FOOTSTEPS from below crossing from one end of the church to
the other

A scratching sound interrupts Rough Frantic Like a dog
pawing at something

The sound abruptly stops
SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH
FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING THE STAIRS
BOOM THERE ARE THUDS ON THE WALL BEHIND US
THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE FROM FEW TO MANY
BOOM BOOM BOOM
AMELIA (0S)
(whispering)
Do you hear that

BOOM THE FLOOR SHAKES OUR VISION TREMORS

WE HEAR THE WALLS SHAKE FROM ALL SIDES AND ALL DIRECTIONS

The FLASHLIGHT slides backwards a quarter of an inch out
from under the jacket We see a frightened Amelia and Chris
react

AMELIA
(whispering)
Fuck my life did that just move
CHRIS
(whispering)
No I kicked it
Chris tosses the jacket back onto the light
ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE CHURCH

THE SCRATCHING SOUNDS LIKE IT’S COMING FROM RIGHT OUTSIDE THE
ATTIC

BOOM THE FLOOR QUAKES

The light slides back again No one’s near it

DUST SWIRLS INTO FRAME

They look at the light unable to speak Chris crawls toward
it His hand reaching for us

Closer

Closer

Closer

Until his hand is hovering just over the lens when --

-- AT A TERRIFYING VELOCITY THE FLASHLIGHT IS RIPPED OUT OF
THE ROOM THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT WE VIOLENTLY FALL DOWN THE

STAIRS AND OUT THE FRONT DOOR LANDING HARD IN THE GRASS
FACING THE FOREST

EXT OLD CHURCH - NIGHT

SCREAMS ESCALATE AND CRESCENDO FROM INSIDE FOLLOWED BY
POUNDING AND DRAGGING

AND THEN SILENCE

Gnats swarm the beam Just a few Then many

Hours later CONDENSATION obscures part of the lens

We come in on Robin emerging from the forest She is limping
freezing hyperventilating Cuts on her face from traveling
in the dark

Seconds later Robin is closer Moving towards us

CLICK TO BLACK

EXT OLD CHURCH - NIGHT

Robin is now two feet away She bends down to pick us up
squinting into the light She rubs off the condensation with
her shirt

She turns the FLASHLIGHT onto the church where we see NIA
standing motionless on the front steps She is calm passive
frozen in a daze Her hands are bloody

ROBIN (0S)
Nia

She reaches her arm out her fingers shaking pleading for
Nia’s attention

ROBIN (0S)

(no voice)
What’s happening What’s
happening

Robin steps closer and closer until they are inches apart
Nia’s emotionless face fills the frame Her eyes are white
Her mouth slightly agape Drool rolls down her chin Shes
not breathing

Robin steps around her edging towards the church Nia
doesn’t move She just stands motionless facing the forest

INT OLD CHURCH NARTHEX - NIGHT

Robin steps inside keeping the light on Nia for as long as
possible

THERE IS A NOISE ABOVE

Robin climbs the stairs She slips Robin aims the light at
her feet THERE’S BLOOD ON THE STAIRS

INT OLD CHURCH ATTIC - NIGHT

Chris and Amelia are gone There is a pile of FOUR
FLASHLIGHTS in the center of the floor including the BLUE
COLEMAN Every flashlight accounted for

The hair on Robin’s arm stands up It’s not just fear
There’s a current in the room

LIGHTS SLOWLY FADE UP ALL AROUND ELECTRICITY WITH NO
DISCERNIBLE SOURCE VIBRANT LIGHT SPILLS THROUGH THE CRACKS
IN THE FLOORBOARDS MOST OF THE LIGHT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM
UNDERNEATH US

Robin moves back downstairs

INT OLD CHURCH NARTHEX - NIGHT

Nia now stands frozen in the doorway Robin approaches She
reaches out and touches Nia’s cold face Nia doesn’t react

ROBIN (0S)
You were right There’s something
evil here and we’re all gonna die

Robin turns to the double doors behind her She enters the
adjoining room

INT OLD CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT
and locks herself inside

The rectangle room is no more than ten feet deep There are
two sets of pews divided by an aisle that leads to a CLOSED
SANCTUARY DOOR on the opposite end of the nave There is a
TRAIL OF BLOOD that leads to this door which itself is
marked with an UPSIDE DOWN CROSS hanging by a single NAIL A
clutter of WHITE CROSSES cover the floor

Hundreds of LIGHT BULBS dangle from the ceiling each tied to
a piece of string ALL ARE MYSTERIOUSLY LIT

Robin sets the FLASHLIGHT on a pew She dodges the hanging
light bulbs as she moves to the sanctuary door She rotates
the UPSIDE DOWN CROSS right side up then opens the door

She kneels into the sanctuary facing us
BOOM We hear Nia try to open the locked door behind us

Robin clasps her hands together With the utmost sincerity
and conviction she bows her head in prayer The last prayer
she’1ll ever give

ROBIN
(softly)
I’m sorry for being jealous For
looking at the world and wondering
why I don’t have “that dress” or
“that car” or “that opportunity”

The piled flashlight from upstairs roll about on the ceiling
above us

ROBIN
(softly)
I’m sorry I’m fake and self-
conscious Mean and bitter
Pretentious and arrogant I’m sorry
I spent so much of my life trying
to be someone I’m not

A BANG echoes through the sanctuary

ROBIN

(softly)
I’m sorry for being ungrateful I’m
sorry for being superficial I’m
sorry for being stupid For coming
here to this forest when I knew I
should never return I’m sorry I
couldn’t save us And I’m sorry for
killing my only real friend

The lights begin dimming all around The frightening sounds
are moving away

ROBIN
(softly)
But mostly
(beat)
I’m sorry for not dying a long time
ago

Robin takes a beat She wipes a tear off her face She looks
up from her prayer The room is dark and calm and quiet She
lowers her hands

A sad painful smile leaks onto her face She is flooded with
the overwhelming feeling of peace Every bit of sadness
trapped in her body is released It’s as if her very words
repelled the evil away And then --

WHAM The sanctuary door snaps shut

ROBIN SCREAMS

The dangling light bulbs start burning brighter and brighter
THE WALL SHAKES Robin thrashes about inside the sanctuary
The FLASHLIGHT rattles then falls

Dust cakes the room

The SCREAMING becomes violent

THE LIGHT BULBS BEGIN POPPING
Glass flies everywhere
POP POP POP

Until the only remaining light in the room is provided by the
FLASHLIGHT

There’s an abrupt SHRIEK followed by SILENCE
The dust settles
The sanctuary door slowly CREAKS open
ROBIN STEPS OUT IN A TRANCE AS IF POSSESSED
She lifts the FLASHLIGHT then a SHARD OF GLASS
Robin opens the double doors
Nia is waiting for her Her eyes flick down as she suddenly
regains consciousness She blinks staring into Robin’s
light A tear rolls down her cheek
NIA
(barely audible)
Robin where are we

(beat)
I wanna go home

ROBIN PLUNGES THE SHARD OF GLASS INTO NIA’S THROAT

Nia collapses to the ground blood spitting everywhere Robin
leaves Nia’s corpse and retreats back into the sanctuary
INT OLD CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

With the FLASHLIGHT now illuminating the dark corners of this
room Robin stabs the floor with the shard of glass her hand
bleeding as she writes

“ETHAN WAS HERE”

Robin stands

INT OLD CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

She returns to the nave It is empty Nia’s body has
vanished

EXT THE CREST - NIGHT

Robin walks outside and around the church

Walking in silence to the end of the open field

We stop finding ourselves at the edge of a fifty foot cliff

The flashlight looms over the edge giving us vertigo And
then --

ROBIN JUMPS

And we free fall with her

All the way down Fifty feet

Cracking and smacking against the cliff wall
THUD

We hit the ground

The lens SPIDER CRACKS

The light FLICKERING

BOOM

Robin hits in the foreground Bloodied and bruised Her body
convulses then freezes

SILENCE FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE FOREVER
Robin stands

She shuffles over to the light dragging a broken leg behind
her She lifts us into her hand

And walks
Three steps forward

The light looks down another cliff ledge This time a ninety
foot drop And then --

SHE JUMPS AGAIN AND AGAIN WE FREE FALL ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO FINISH THE JOB

The light lands and the lens bursts Flickering still And we
hold Waiting for one last scare And instead we get --

-- the SUNRISE Warm light expands across the forest

For the first time our POINT OF VIEW separates itself from
the FLASHLIGHT

We push out through the shattered lens and see the FLASHLIGHT
HOVERING in mid-air illuminated still until --

The light DIES and the FLASHLIGHT drops to the ground

We rise high into the canopy looking down on ROBIN’S REMAINS
and FOUR OTHER BODIES (Nia Ben Chris Amelia) realizing
our point of view was never that of the flashlight but
rather the presence that possessed the flashlight

FADE TO BLACK
