INT LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY

The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN a 27-
year-old risk assessment analyst He has a Doctorate from MIT
and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
screens

An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
out of the elevator carrying large file boxes They walk down
a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
the trading floor The scope of the floor now comes into
frame There are more computers than can be imagined and
several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
thousands of numbers PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
sitting next to him SETH BREGMAN a young analyst in his
early twenties

SETH
Is that them

PETER
(nods yes)

SETH
Jesus Christ

The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
almost every person on the floor watches

SETH (contd)
Are they going to do it right there

PETER
Yeah
SETH
Fuck me

WILL EMERSON sitting next to them leans back in his chair

WILL EMERSON
(whispered)
Have you guys ever seen this before

SETH
No

WILL EMERSON
Best to just ignore it Keep your head
down and get back to work and dont
watch

The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
and asking their name It is brutal The camera follows one
HR woman HEATHER with her piece of paper down the hall and
into a row of employees she walks right past the THREE GUYS
then stops a bit down from them

HEATHER
Timothy Singh

TIMOTHY
Yes

HEATHER
Im afraid we have to speak with you

TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
the woman PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
back into the numbers on his computer screen

The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
screen It runs for almost the length of the song until
finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder He takes off
his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS He is shell-shocked

SAM ROGERS
You are all still here for a reason
Most of this floor was just sent home
forever We have spent the last hour
saying good-bye they were good people
and they were good at their jobs but
you all were better Now they are gone
They are not to be thought of again This
is your opportunity On every floor of
this building and in every office from
Hong Kong to London the same thing is
happening Before this is all done 3 of
every ten guys who were standing between
you and your bosss job are now gone
That is your opportunity Ive been at
this place for thirty-four years and let
me tell you that this will not be the
last time you go through this But you
all are survivors And that is how this
firm over 107 years has always continued
to grow stronger So hold your heads
high and get back to work

personal belongings in it

SARAH ROBERTSON
Eric I didnt do anything

Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting

around and sees no one then inserts it into his computer He
has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone The frame
is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers
flying by

INT INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - NIGHT

on our books at any given time But what
Eric was trying to do here is work it for
levels of volatility that fall outside
the limits of our standard VAR model

WILL EMERSON
What are those levels

PETER
Well its a fairly complicated

WILL EMERSON
Simplify

PETER
The volatility boundaries are basically
set using historic patterns then
stretching them out another 10-15
roughly

patterns

INT BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR

SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it
struggles through traffic up town SETH reaches into his bag
and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag Their
conversation is quiet as if they are afraid someone might be
listening

SETH
You want one

PETER
No

PETER gives him a bit of a look

SETH
What we got them on our way to meet you
at the office we didnt know what the

fuck you wanted to talk about
(almost to himself)

thought you mightve gotten some
chick pregnant or something

PETER
I havent gotten laid in so long thats
not possible at this point

SETH
I guess thats true

PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street
enjoying the Thursday night

PETER
Look at these people

SETH
What

PETER
We are in here stressing our fucking
heads off that the world as we know it is
ending and theyve got no idea whats
coming

SETHS demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesnt seem to
project much in the way of stress

PETER (contd)
Right

SETH
I try not to let work get to me

22 22

PETER
Ive noticed that about you actually

SETH
Look we are twenty three years old

PETER
Twenty-Seven

SETH
Whatever same thing I made almost a
quarter of a million dollars last year
for what pushing some numbers around
on a computer screen so a bunch of
glorified crack addicts could take that
information and pretend to understand it
and then make a bet against some other
jock half way around the world who if he
wasnt doing this would probably be in
some OTB somewhere putting it all on
number seven And at the end of the day
one guy loses and the other guy wins

PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long
beat Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH

PETER
You do know its a little more
complicated than that

SETHS phone starts playing a ring tone He looks down at the
text

SETH
Its Will He wants to know if weve
found him What do I tell him

PETER
Tell him that we havent found him

INT TRADING FLOOR

SAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking
quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading
floor He looks around then heads over to WILL EMERSONS
office where the light is on

INT WILL EMERSONS OFFICE-CONTINUOUS

SAM lightly knocks on the glass

SAM ROGERS
Hey

24

WILL EMERSON
Hey

SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on then
eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair They
wait for who goes first

SAM ROGERS
So

WILL EMERSON
Eric Dale

SAM ROGERS
Oh Jesus
WILL EMERSON
Before he was escorted out of the
building by security

SAM ROGERS
I had nothing to do with that

WILL EMERSON
I know

SAM ROGERS
Im sorry go on

WILL EMERSON
So as he was leaving the building he
hands a disk to Peter Sullivan

SAM ROGERS
Whos Peter Sullivan again

WILL EMERSON
One of Erics guys

SAM ROGERS
Right

WILL EMERSON
and tells him that he was almost on to
something but hasnt been able to figure
it out So he gives him the disk and says
give it a try but the last thing he
says as the doors to the elevator close
is “be careful

SAM ROGERS
Be careful

24 24

WILL EMERSON
Yeah

SAM ROGERS
Be careful

WILL EMERSON
Yes

SAM ROGERS
Why

WILL EMERSON
Well take a look

SAM ROGERS

fucking things they put together

WILL EMERSON

thing after your little pep talk nice
job by the way and he seems to have
nailed it

SAM ROGERS
Nailed it

WILL EMERSON

The kid figured out what Eric was
missing And

SAM ROGERS
And

WILL gives him a long pause

WILL EMERSON
»it isnt good

WILLS look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind
WILL at his desk and look at the computer

WILL EMERSON (contd)
As far as I can tell these here are the
historical volatility index limits
which I guess our whole fucking trading
model relies on pretty heavily and we
are so fucking levered up that if this
thing starts getting outside those limits
it gets ugly in a hurry

SAM ROGERS
How ugly 24

WILL EMERSON
Real ugly

SAM ROGERS
And how close to those limits have we
gotten

WILL EMERSON
Oh were beyond close We broke through
five or six days over the last two weeks
but weve managed to stay on the upside
of it for now

SAM ROGERS
For now

WILL EMERSON
Well look what happens here when we get
on the wrong side of it

SAM ROGERS
What am I looking at

WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole
lot of zeroes after it SAMS look says it all

WILL EMERSON
And that wouldnt even be that bad a day
for us historically speaking

SAM ROGERS
Is this right

WILL EMERSON
I dont know

SAM ROGERS
Where is Eric

WILL EMERSON
We shut his phone off

SAM ROGERS
Of course we did

WILL EMERSON

SAM ROGERS

the table is JARED COHEN He is a blond boyish looking 43
year old although carries himself with intense confidence
He is the head of all fixed income securities and oversees
roughly 25000 employees Next to him is his chief risk
management officer SARAH ROBERTSON the same woman from
outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC
Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH a sixty year
old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer They
are all dressed sharply for a new day Long silence

SETH COUGHS
ALL PRESENT look down at him

JARED COHEN
So Sam what do you have for us

SAM ROGERS
Well it should be here in a minute
Finding someone in the copy room at this
hour was a little bit of a challenge

JARED COHEN
Well why dont we start by introducing
everyone then

SAM ROGERS
OK

JARED COHEN
This is Sarah Robertson who you know our
chief risk management officer Ramesh
Shah from upstairs and David Horn one of
the firms in house counsel

SAM ROGERS
Nice to meet you all This is Will
Emerson my head of trading and this
is

WILL EMERSON
Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman They
work in our risk department

JARED COHEN
Where is Eric Dale

SAM ROGERS
He was let go today

JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been
her call to let ERIC go she nods yes

JARED COHEN
So whos left in your risk department

WILL EMERSON
As of today that would be Peter and our
junior analyst Seth

Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH Their
inexperience glares back
JARED COHEN
Really

JARED looks back at SARAH then the room goes silent again
Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door

COPY ROOM GUY
Will Emerson

31 31

WILL EMERSON
Here Please just give one to everyone
thanks

The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the
room

SAM ROGERS
So apparently Eric had been working on
this for some time but was unable to
finish it as he was leaving the building
today he gave the program to Peter here
and told him to see what he thought
Peter figured a few things out that Eric
seemed to be missing and this is what
came out

JARED COHEN
Where is Eric Dale now

SAM ROGERS
Hes been unreachable since he left the
office

JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of
them and start reviewing SAM WILL PETER and SETH just sit
in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as
they all read This goes on for a full very long minute
Finally

SARAH ROBERTSON
Peter this is your work

PETER
Mainly Mr Dales

SARAH ROBERTSON
But this draft is yours
PETER
Yes Again derived from Mr Dales
original model But yes

SARAH ROBERTSON
And what is your background

PETER
Background

SARAH ROBERTSON

Your CV

31 31
PETER
I have been with the firm for two years
working with Eric that whole time But

I hold a doctorate in engineering
specialist in propulsion from MIT with
a Bachelors from Penn

JARED COHEN
Whats a specialty in propulsion

PETER
Well in laymen terms my thesis was a
study in the way that friction ratios
effect steering outcomes in aeronautical
use under reduced gravity loads

Long silence

JARED COHEN
So you are a rocket scientist

The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe

PETER
Um I was yes

JARED COHEN
How did you end up here

PETER
Well its all just numbers really youre
just changing what youre adding up
and if I may speak freely the money is
considerably more attractive here

JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his
tone suddenly switches to serious testy even

JARED COHEN
What time is it

RAMESH
Its 215

SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit

JARED COHEN
What do you have in exposure right now

tonight
SAM ROGERS
I dont know between 900 and 13
roughly

31 31
RAMESH

If Mr Sullivans numbers are correct

RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through
the numbers and takes a beat too long

PETER
1215 Trillion

RAMESH checks his number

RAMESH
Yes

JARED COHEN
Fuck me fuck me And Im guessing by
the fact that you two havent said
anything that the math checks out

JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH SARAH then looks to
RAMESH She looks back

SARAH ROBERTSON
Look wed need a little more time to go
over this but Mr Sullivan here seems to
know what hes doing And I dont have to
tell you that this is a problem

JARED COHEN
Thank you for that What time is it

RAMESH
216

JARED COHEN
Fuck me

Jared stands up and walks around the small room The rest of
the room goes silent Finally

JARED COHEN (contd)
Sam how long under normal operations
would it take your people to clear that
from our books

SAM ROGERS
What

JARED COHEN
The 12 trillion

SAM ROGERS
All of it

31 JARED COHEN
Yes

SAM ROGERS
I dont know a couple weeks

JARED COHEN
Weeks

SAM ROGERS
Yes But as you certainly know our
business is selling AND buying It
doesnt work for very long without both
components If we suddenly stop buying
for a day or two that just doesnt hide
under the rug it gets out and this whole

this thing comes to a end and right
quick

JARED COHEN
I understand

SAM ROGERS
Do you

JARED COHEN
How many traders do we have left between
your floor and Petersens

SAM ROGERS
I dont know sixty

RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this
conversation has been taking place

RAMESH
Jared Ive just been looking here a
little closer and its these VAR numbers
that are really setting this thing off

JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh Jared nods his
head his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing

JARED COHEN
Excuse me I need to make a quick call

JARED calmly stands up and steps out of the room for a long
moment The room stays completely quiet the whole time he is

gone We hear nothing It is awkward to say the least
comes back in and sits down without missing a beat

JARED COHEN (contd)
Please

RAMESH
I was just saying and just speaking
completely off the record here it wont
be long before someone else starts
putting these in and sees the exact same
thing we are looking at here If they
havent already

Pause
JARED COHEN
Understood And Sarah what value would
you allow to be placed on those assets
that might be left on the books if they
had to be

SARAH ROBERTSON
Why would they still be on the books

SAM ROGERS
Because suddenly no one wants to buy
them

JARED COHEN
Oh fuck you Sam give me a fucking
break all at once

SARAH ROBERTSON
Without an active market it could take
weeks months for me to value them
correctly Youd have to go block by
block

SAM ROGERS
Its a very simple business Jared You
and I talked about this last year

JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off

JARED COHEN
Sam Will Peter and

SETH
Seth

JARED COHEN
Seth Could you please excuse us for a
few minutes
They stand up and start to exit the room
JARED COHEN (contd)
Oh and Peter Who else has seen this

31 31

PETER thinks that through
PETER
No one besides us here

JARED COHEN
And Mr Dale

PETER
Yes

JARED COHEN
And can it really be that we dont know
where Eric Dale is

WILL EMERSON
Im afraid so His wife tells us he
hasnt come home yetand the firm shut
off his phone today

JARED COHEN
Perfect Well I need to know where he
is

WILL SETH and PETER leave the room and close the door
behind them

SAM ROGERS
Yes but what the hell do I know

JARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the
packet

JARED COHEN
Well Mr Shah tell me if Im wrong but

RAMESH
If I may Id like to take some time
before we

SARAH ROBERTSON
Jared we cant answer that yet

JARED COHEN
Are you fucking kidding me this is

exactly what weve

SARAH now cuts him off abruptly

SARAH ROBERTSON
We need a little time before we can give
you our conclusion

SARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED

JARED COHEN
OK We meet in 45 minutes

RAMESH
Sam do you have this file

SAM ROGERS
Yes here it is

SAM slides him the hard drive across the table they all take
a second to follow it

JARED COHEN
And Sam we need Eric Dale its making me
very uneasy knowing he is out there right
now wanting to put a knife in our backs
while hes not even aware hes holding
the knife in his hand

SARAH and RAMESH leave the room as SAM is left alone with
JARED

SAM ROGERS
What are you going to do

JARED COHEN
Not sure

SAM ROGERS
Are you going to call him

They both look at each other for a long beat Finally

THEY are all still smoking and looking out over the city
Finally WILL stands up and goes over to the edge and looks
over He jumps up and sits on the edge

PETER
Careful

SETH
Jesus man

WILL EMERSON
Did you know the fear most people feel
when they stand on the edge like this is
not actually a fear that they will fall
but instead its the subconscious fearing
that they might jump Its a fear of
losing faith

SETH
Well thats a little deep and depressing
thank you

WILL EMERSON
Yeah well I can get a little dark
sometimes

SETH
Will come on Get down

WILL jumps down and comes back over to sit down They stare

WILL EMERSON
Yeah you watch

SETH

Long silence

PETER

WILL EMERSON
Yeah kinda shocked me although I was
able to write most of it off as

With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the

sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over

area with two couches JARED is intensely going over the
papers in front of him SAM is just looking out the window

SAM ROGERS
How old are you

JARED COHEN

SAM ROGERS
Jesus

JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares
out the window as well

JARED COHEN
This is a very very bad dream

SAM looks over at him directly
SAM ROGERS
I dont know seems like we actually may
have just finally woken up

SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door SAM sits up

SARAH ROBERTSON
Hello

JARED COHEN

SAM ROGERS
How do we look

Her look says it all

SAM ROGERS (contd)
I should go

SARAH ROBERTSON
No you should stay

JARED COHEN
So

SARAH ROBERTSON
(dead calm delivery)
Its all legit the kid killed it The
formula is worthless

They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost

JARED COHEN

SARAH ROBERTSON

JARED COHEN
There are eight trillion dollars of paper
around the world relying on that
equation

SARAH ROBERTSON
Dont even start This was discussed

How do you think Ive stuck around this
place so long

He walks out of the room SARAH and JARED look each other
over

JARED COHEN
Ive called Tuld

SARAH ROBERTSON
Is there a contingency plan here

JARED COHEN
A contingency plan

SARAH ROBERTSON

JARED COHEN
We went all in on this one

SARAH ROBERTSON

JARED COHEN
To Tuld or the market

SARAH ROBERTSON
Both 40

They both stare at each other Jareds phone buzzes He takes
it out and his face says it all

SARAH ROBERTSON (contd)

straightens his tie in the reflection of the window He

exits

They cut through a short cut near the freight elevator WILL

PETER and SETH are coming down the stairway from the roof

WILL EMERSON
We were just grabbing a cigarette on the
roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter
dive-bombed us and then landed

JARED COHEN
I know Come with us Wheres Sam

WILL EMERSON
I dont know Do you want all of us

JARED COHEN
Yes

JARED ushers the whole group towards the conference room

INT OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

All five walk in silence Finally

JARED COHEN
Just one piece of advice to everyone here
before we go in there this could get a
bit ugly but whatever you do just
tell the truth dont try to change a
word of it no sugar coating no one
here is smart enough including the
rocket scientist

He continues on

INT ELEVATOR BANK OUTSIDE JAREDS CONFERENCE ROOM -

CONTINUOUS

The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the
opening elevator door is a very well dressed page anda
female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for
the day ahead

ASSISTANT

JARED COHEN
Yes

ASSISTANT
This way They are already in there
waiting for you

JARED COHEN
OK

INT CEOS EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
room with a commanding view of the city It is filled with
people along one side of the table There are a team of five
lawyers three compliance officers a couple of key board
members twelve in all On the near side of the table sits
RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone The head of
the table is empty

They all file in and sit down They all sit in silence
waiting Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
into the room He is dressed in a average suit and tie is
not tall late fifties and doesnt have a hair on his head
He carries himself without much exception His eyes however
tell a far different tale Intense even at rest He walks the
length of the room everyone half stands up

JOHN TULD
Please sit down

He then seats himself at the head of the table Everyone in
the room has the printout in front of them JARED is seated
immediately to his left then SAM then SARAH RAMESH WILL
PETER and finally SETH

JOHN TULD (contd)
Welcome everyone I must apologize for
dragging you all here at such an uncommon
hour but from what Ive been told this
matter needs to be handled urgently so
urgently in fact that it probably should
have been addressed weeks ago

(MORE )

( )

JOHN TULD (contd)
but that is spilt milk under the bridge
So why doesnt someone please try to
explain to me whats the problem here

Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks
up

JARED COHEN
Well Mr Tuld as I mentioned earlier if
you look here at the top page of this
printout

He cuts him off

JOHN TULD
Jared its a little early for all that
how bout in English Actually Id
like to hear from the guy who put this
thing together Mr Sullivan is it

Does he speak English

JARED COHEN
Sir

JOHN TULD
Id like to speak to the analyst who
seems to have stumbled across this mess

JARED COHEN
Well thats Peter Sullivan here

JARED looks down the table to PETER as does everyone else in
the room JARED gives him a go ahead look

PETER
Sir

JOHN TULD
Ah there he is

PETER
Yes sir

JOHN TULD
How old are you Mr Sullivan

PETER
Im twenty-seven sir

JOHN TULD
Please call me John

PETER
Yes sir 45

JOHN TULD
So Mr Sullivan why dont you tell me
what you think is going on here and
please speak as you might to a young
child or a golden retriever I didnt get
here on my brains I can assure you of
that

PETER is very nervous

PETER
Well sir As I guess you may or may not
know I work for Mr Rogers here as an
associate in the risk assessment and
management office at MBS

JOHN TULD
Now you lost me at M

PETER
Sorry

JOHN TULD
was joking Mr Sullivan

PETER

Yes Well as you probably know over the
last 36-40 months the firm has begun
packaging new MBS products that combine
several different traunches of rating
classification in one tradable security
This has been very profitable as I
imagine you noticed

JOHN TULD

have

PETER
Well the firm is currently doing a
considerable amount of this business
every day The problem which is I guess
why we are here tonight is that it takes
us the firm almost a month to layer

these products correctly thereby posing a
challenge from a risk management
standpoint

JOHN TULD
And Mr Sullivan that challenge is

PETER
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to 45

JOHN TULD
Yes

PETER

But the key factor is these are
essentially just mortgages so that has
allowed us to push the leverage
considerably beyond what you might be
willing or allowed to do in any other
circumstance thereby pushing the risk
profile without raising any red flags

JOHN TULD
And how far have we pushed that profile
tonight Mr Sullivan

PETER
We have pushed it to 1215 Trillion
dollars at MBS alone

JOHN TULD

Give or take

PETER
Give or take

JOHN TULD

Now Mr Sullivan what I am guessing and
give me a little rope here what I am
guessing that your report here says is
that considering the shall we say bumpy
road weve been on the last week or so
that the numbers that your brilliant co-
workers up the line ahead of you had come
up with in the past dont seem to make
much sense anymore considering whats

taking place today

PETER

Actually not taking place today but
whats already taken place over the last
two weeks

JOHN TULD
So what youre saying is its already
happened

PETER
Sort of

JOHN TULD
And Mr Sullivan what does your model say
that means for us here 45

PETER
Well thats where it becomes a
projection But

PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward

JOHN TULD
Youre speaking with me Mr Sullivan

PETER
Well sir if those assets were to
decrease by just 25 percent and remain
on our books well that loss would
be greater than the current market
capitalization of this company

The room goes silent JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard
He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into

the city

JOHN TULD
So what youre telling me Mr Sullivan is
that the music appears to be about to
stop and we are going to be holding the
biggest bag of stinking shit ever
assembled in the history of capitalism

Everyone looks back at PETER

JOHN TULD
beat

JOHN TULD (contd)
Mr Sullivan

PETER
Well sir Im not sure Id put it that
way but let me clarify using your
analogy what this model shows is the
music so to speak just slowing if the
music were to stop as you put it then
this model would not be even close to
that scenario It would be considerably
worse

JOHN TULD
Well let me tell you something Mr
Sullivan Do you want to know why Im
sitting here in this chair with you all
why I get the big bucks so to speak

PETER
Yes
JOHN TULD
Im here for one reason and one reason
only 45

continues to look out over the city for a long

JOHN TULD (contd)
Im here to guess what the music is gonna
do a week month a year from now Thats

it nothing more and Im afraid
standing here tonight that I dont
hear a thing just silence

The room falls completely still for at least half a minute

Then JOHN

TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more

upbeat tone and looks up and down the table

JOHN TULD (contd)
So now that we know that the music has
stopped what can we do about it

Long Silence

JOHN TULD (contd)
Mr Cohen Ms Robertson Im afraid this

JARED and

is where you are supposed to step back
in Lord knows we relied enough on Mr
Sullivan today

SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts

JOHN TULD (contd)
What have you got for us

Long pause

JOHN TULD (contd)
What have I told you since the first day
you walked into my office (pause) That
there are three ways to make a living in
this business Be first be smarter or
cheat Well I dont cheat and even
though I like to think we have got some
pretty smart people in this building of
the two remaining options it sure is a
hell of alot easier to just be first

The room goes silent again as Mr Tuld stares back out the

window

JOHN TULD

SAM looks
other for

JARED COHEN
Sell it all today

smiles just a bit Then turns

JOHN TULD
Is that even possible Sam 45

across the room at JOHN TULD they have known each
35 years

SAM ROGERS
It is but at what cost

JOHN TULD
Ill pay

SAM ROGERS
Really

JOHN and SAM look and read each other

JOHN TULD

I think so

SAM ROGERS
Almost a trillion bucks of paper

JOHN TULD
Where does it come back to us

SAM ROGERS
Everywhere

JOHN TULD
Sam I dont think you seem to understand
what your boy down here just said if I
made you how would you do it

SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long long

SAM ROGERS
You bring the traders in for their normal
630 meeting and you be honest with them
theyre gonna know its the end either
way so youd have to throw them a bone
and a pretty big one Youd have to come
out of the gate storming 40 percent
done by 1015 and 70 percent of your
positions need to be gone by eleven
cause by lunch the word will be out No
swaps no nothing and by two oclock
youll be getting 65 cents on the dollar
if youre lucky and the feds will be in
here looking up your ass and trying to
slow us down

JOHN TULD
Ramesh

He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table

beat

RAMESH
Theyll slow you down but its yours to
sell They cant stop you

SAM ROGERS
John lets just say we pull that off
which is saying something the real

question is who are we selling this

to

JOHN TULD
The same people youve been selling this
to for the last two years and whoever

else will buy it
They look at each other to see if they understand each other

SAM ROGERS
If you do this youve killed that market
for years Its over

JOHN TULD
(Nods )

SAM ROGERS
And you are selling something you know
has no value

JOHN TULD
(cuts him off cold)
We are selling to willing buyers at the
current fair market price so that WE may
survive Sam

SAM ROGERS
Youll never sell a thing to any one of
them again

JOHN TULD
I understand

SAM ROGERS
Do you
JOHN TULD
Do you This is it Sam this is it

The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them
go at it Silence

JOHN TULD (contd)

Its 400 Jared youve got till 500
to break this down and draw me up a plan
(MORE )

45 45

JOHN TULD (contd)
Is there anyone else who actually knows
whats in there right now block by
block

PETER

JOHN TULD
Where is Eric Dale

SARAH ROBERTSON
As of today he is no longer with the
firm

JARED COHEN
We have been trying to locate him

JOHN TULD

JOHN TULD looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret
service looking guy

JOHN TULD
Carmelo

LOUIS CARMELO
Yes

JOHN TULD
Get me Eric Dale here by 630

LOUIS CARMELO

JOHN TULD

JOHN TULD
You and I are salesmen Sam we sell

SAM ROGERS

SAM ROGERS
Well I agree with you there Ive been

SAM ROGERS
I dont think I can go in knowing what I
know and put the hammer down on these

Oh please when did you become so soft

WILL looks around the garage than back at JARED

They look
question

WILL
I dont think thats ever been a problem

JARED COHEN
Of course it hasnt but during acute
situations such as this often what is
right can take on multiple
interpretations

at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the
In the background the squeals of tires on concrete

WILL
Sam will step up

JARED COHEN
I know he willbut if he doesnt

As the question stands unfinished Wills convertible flies

into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL
The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED

hands the attendant a tip JARED then looks back at WILL who
is waiting to get in the car

JARED COHEN (CONTD) (contd)

WILL
That I will what

JARED COHEN
Step up

WILL climbs into the car and shuts the door He looks at
JARED through the open window with SETH now sitting next to
him within earshot

WILL
I have no doubt Sam will make the right
choice And if it makes you feel any
better he and I have always had the same
interpretation of whats rightno
matter how acute the situation

WILL puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage
leaving JARED standing there

The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULDS
liking

JOHN TULD
Cohen has done a nice job It can work

SAM ROGERS

JOHN TULD
It means as you very well know that you
are a very important piece of this
puzzle

They look directly at each other

JOHN TULD (contd)
Here
JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper SAM opens
it and looks at it

SAM ROGERS

blocking the doorway

EXT CITY STREETS - MORNING

There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the
buildings PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size
headphones on his ears The music is all we hear He wanders
around the almost completely empty city and the further he
walks the less his face changes
EXT CITY STREET - STREET CART - MORNING

PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart
He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops The
wind blows

see the figure of a woman coming towards him It is
immediately obvious that he knows her He stops and she keeps
slowly walking towards him They stop in front of each other
squarely

LUCY

PETER

a bartender or something she is not dressed for banking

LUCY

for a walk

LUCY

clarifies Finally

PETER

She looks at him with concern as he doesnt even hint at a
smile as he says this They then give a small kiss on the
cheek and part

INT SARAH ROBERTSONS OFFICE - DAY

SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window She
calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes
it Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass
wall separating her office from the floor giving herself
total privacy She walks over to her desk and sits down She
reaches over and grabs a box of tissues methodically
preparing to cry almost like a surgeon preparing to work
She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected Her
face starts to tweak just a little but it just will not give
way Again she tries And again She can not cry She cant
believe it The deeply tragic look of total failure floods
her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face Still no
tears Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob but it
isnt real and she knows it Then she tries to laugh to
herself she tries again to laugh but it too is not real
She does feel something but she simply and very sadly can
only openly express even to herself nothing

driving to get from Wheeling to New

miles of driving a day and 25410000
miles a month and 304920000 miles a

goes

years ago Over the life of that one
bridge thats 6 billion 708 million
240 thousand miles that havent had to be
driven At lets say 50 miles an hour
thats 134164800 hours or 559020

WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan
which spans up and out in front of them through the
windshield There is a long silence and finally

SETH
So am I getting fired

WILL EMERSON
I dont know

Very long pause then he looks over at SETH and decides
whether to tell the truth

WILL EMERSON (contd)
Probablyyesalmost definitely

SETH
Are you

WILL EMERSON
No

This clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly

SETH
Oh

WILL EMERSON
Its not personal youre just in the
wrong place at the wrong time the young
guys are always the first to go Nothing
I say is gonna make you feel any better

61

SETH
I get it
SETH looks over at WILL and around at the interior of the
luxury car and then back into the city

SETH (CONTD) (contd)
When did you know this is what you wanted
to do

He thinks that through

WILL EMERSON
The first time I made 36 million dollars
for the firm in the last eleven minutes
of the trading day

SETH
Fuck me

WILL EMERSON
It was a perfect tradeI saw it coming
from three days away I took my time I
was in I was outPish poshAnd it
was beautiful

SETH
How did you learn to do that

WILL EMERSON
Im not sure and whatever it is it could
be gone tomorrow

WILL EMERSON (CONTD) (contd)
Look man Im sorry about this

WILL EMERSON

SETH

WILL EMERSON
Everyone else

SETH
Normal people

WILL EMERSON
What are you a socialist Fuck me Seth

WILL looks over at SETH sizing him up looking to see if he
has what it takes

WILL EMERSON (contd)
Look If you want to do this with your
life and do it well you need to believe
that you are necessary And you are If
people want to live like thiswith

Long look

their big cars and these houses that they
havent even paid for Then you are
necessary The only reason they can
continue to live like kings is because
weve got our fingers on the scale in
THEIR favor And if I were to take my
finger off

(MORE ) 61
WILL EMERSON (contd)
Then the whole world gets really fucking
fair really fucking quickly And no one
wants that they say they dobut they
dont They want what were giving them
but they also want to play innocent and
pretend they have no idea how we get it
And thats more hypocrisy than I can
swallow So fuck em

out at the city ahead

WILL EMERSON (contd)
And tomorrow if this all goes south
theyll crucify us for being reckless
but if we are wrong and everything gets
back on track Theyll be laughing their
arses off at us for being the biggest
bunch of pussies that God ever let
through the door

He is trying to convince himself as much as SETH They both
look out the windows

SETH
Are we gonna be wrong on this one

WILL looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above

them

Notheyre all gonna get fucked

SARAH ROBERTSON

expressed with insufficient urgency

SARAH ROBERTSON (contd)

ERIC

SARAH ROBERTSON

They both look at each other with miniscule smiles then out
the windows onto the city defeated Long silence

SARAH ROBERTSON

Long pause as he lets her alone

ERIC

SARAH ROBERTSON

ERIC

SARAH ROBERTSON

FADE IN

INT VIP TRADING ROOM - 630 AM

There are 40 young 90 male traders jammed into the
conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly
with one another They are oblivious to what is about to
happen Eventually SAM WILL JARED and a firm lawyer come
into the room Everyone quiets down a bit

67

WILL EMERSON
Alright hey (whistles)

They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the
table JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner
just to observe SAM looks somber

SAM ROGERS
Thank you all for coming in a little
early this morning I know yesterday was
pretty bad I wish I could say that today
is going to be less so but that isnt
going to be the case Now I am supposed
to read this statement here to you all
but how bout you read it on your own time
and Ill just tell you what the fucks
going on here

THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM he
continues

SAM ROGERS (contd)
I have spent the night here meeting with
the executive committee and the decision
has been made to begin to unwind a
considerable portion of the firms
holdings in several key asset classes
The crux of it is in the firms
thinking the party is over as of this
morning There is going to be
considerable turmoil in the markets for
the foreseeable future They believe that
it is better to have this turmoil begin
with us as a result the firm has
decided to liquidate the majority of its
position of fixed income MBS today

An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the
traders in the room

SAM ROGERS (contd)
You should be getting a breakdown right
now you will see the accounts you are
responsible for today Im sure it hasnt
taken you long to understand the
implications of this sale on your
relationships with your counterparties
and as a result on your careers I have
expressed this reality to the executive
committee and they understand As a
result if you are able to complete a 93
sale of your assets you will receive a
14 million dollar one off bonus

(MORE )

SAM stops

SAM looks
that they 67
SAM ROGERS (contd)
If the floor as a whole is able to
achieve a 93 sale we all get an
additional 13 million a piece Because
of this if you burn through your
allotment by noon get moving around the
floor and start picking up other guys
leftovers

for a second and looks around the room

SAM ROGERS (contd)
For those of you who have never been
through this before this is what the
beginning of a fire sale looks like I
dont have to tell any of you that the
first hour and a half is going to be very
important I want you to hit every bite
you can find Dealers clients brokers
and your mother if shes buyingand
obviously no swaps its outgoing only
today This is obviously not the way any
of us would like for this to be going
down but the ground is shifting below
our feet and there appears to be no
other way out

around the room again person by person and sees
indeed know what needs to be done

SAM ROGERS (contd)
Obviously this is a very unique
situation if we are successful today
we will have been successful in
destroying our own jobs I can not
promise that each of you will be
repositioned within the firm but I can
tell you that I am very proud of the work
we have done together here I have been
at this here for 34 years and I know
from experience people are going to say
some nasty stuff about what we have done
here and what you have devoted a portion
of your life to But have faith that in
the greater picture our skills have not
been wasted we have accomplished much
and our talents have served some greater
good

He looks down at the ground then back up around the room

Then he walks out

FADE TO BLACK

INT TRADING FLOOR- 820 AM

There is a very quiet energy on the floor A low murmur Then
a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that
the CEO JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor He
appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent JOHN
walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into
the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor He
looks around and stands in letting the drama build Then he
climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a
general

JOHN TULD
By the end of today almost everyone else
in the world including me will have
considerably less money than they began
the day with You in this room are
the exception You will leave here today
richer You will fire the first shot I
wish it didnt have to be but at times
the market must eat its weak and you
all are not the weak We must strike
quick with no doubt if you hear pause
on the line attack By noon the SEC is
going to be in here getting in your
faces sniffing around you let us take
care of them and you just keep going We
own what we are choosing to sell today
and there is nothing they can do about
it 107 years ago this firm was founded
today we secure our place for next 107
Youve got two minutes before we get
started Lets finish this so we can get
on to the next one

JOHN TULD climbs down from the table SAM who is standing
off to the side walks along the entire floor slowly and then

heads into his office

INT SAM ROGERS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes

almost silent Through the glass you see the trading floor go
wild then he walks over to his desk turns around and stares
into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs
begin to move We just see the back of his head

INT INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY

Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the
day

INT SAM ROGERS OFFICE - 402 PM

The market has closed SAM sits staring at his computers
There is a knock on his door He turns and as it opens we
hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration He looks up
and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway

JARED COHEN
Well done

SAM ROGERS
They did alright

JARED COHEN
I wanted to give you a heads up They are
going to start sending some people home
out here

SAM ROGERS

JARED COHEN

SAM ROGERS
Of course

JARED COHEN
For what its worth youre good Guess

SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word

INT TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN
BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes
to lay off more people SAM heads off towards the elevator

INT SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of
floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city
beyond The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the
last table TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but
waves him down SAM approaches
JOHN TULD
Sam please sit Congratulations are
clearly in order
SAM ROGERS
Our guys did what they could

73

JOHN TULD
You did a hell of a job today and I
thank you for it Sit excuse me for
eating but its been a long day Can I
get you anything

SAM ROGERS
No no thanks

They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few
more bites of his meal

TULD
So what can I do for you

SAM ROGERS
I want out

TULD
Im sorry

SAM ROGERS
They look

Im done I want out

TULD
Its been a very difficult day for
everyone

SAM ROGERS

I need you to release my options that is
if theyre still worth anything after
today and I need the bonus Im out

TULD
Youll get the bonus the options and
keep your current base but need you to
stay with me for another 24 months OK

at each other SAM seems to know its not actually

a question SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
hearty bite of his meal He finally looks up

TULD (contd)
For Gods sake man put a smile on your
face you did some good today you said
so yourself Im starting to feel a
little better about this whole thing
Youre one of the luckiest guys in the
world you couldve been digging ditches
all these years

SAM pushes back his chair stands and prepares to leave 73

SAM ROGERS
Thats true and if I had been at least
thered be some holes in the ground to
show for it Im just not quite sure how
we fucked this thing up so badly

This pushes TULD a bit too far He also senses he may be
losing SAM He drops his fork and his tone changes

TULD
Jesus when did you start feeling so
sorry for yourself its unbearable
What you think we may have helped put
some people out of business today That
its all just for naught Well youve
been doing that everyday for almost forty
years Sam And if all this is for naught
then so is everything else out there
Its just money its made up a piece of
paper with some pictures on it so we
dont all kill each other trying to get
something to eat But its not wrong and
its certainly not any different today
than its ever been Ever 1637 1797
1819 °37 57°84 1901 “07 1929 °37
“73 and 1987 God damn did that
motherfucker fuck me up good 92 97
2000 and whatever this is gonna be
called Theyre just the same thing over
and over We cant help ourselves and
you and I cant control it stop it slow
it or even ever so slightly alter it
We just react and we get paid well for
it if were right and get left by the
side of the road if were wrong Theres
always been and theres always gonna be
the same percentage of winners and
losers happy fucks and sad sacks fat
pigs and starving dogs in this world
yes there may be more of us today but
the percentages they always stay
exactly the same

They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks
down and takes another bite He chews He looks up again

SAM ROGERS
Ill do it John but not because of your
little speech but because I need the
money Im not sure how it could possibly
be after all these years but I need the
money 73

They both look at each other again then look over and see
JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER
SULLIVAN next to him

SAM ROGERS (contd)
Youre keeping the kid

JOHN TULD
Keeping him Hes getting promoted Its
all hands on deck now Sam theres going
to be a lot of money to be made coming
out of this mess were going to need all
the brains we can get around here

They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking
away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod

VERY SLOW FADE TO BLACK
OVER BLACK
We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel
FADE IN
EXT VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 1100 PM 74
Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
digging Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag
He continues to dig Eventually the flood lights from the
house come on and the whole back yard lights up Then the
door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
slippers comes out onto the deck It is SAMS EX-WIFE MARY

MARY ROGERS

SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel
handle
