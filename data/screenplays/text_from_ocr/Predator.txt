FADE IN
1 EXT OUTER SPACE 1

The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars

As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
of the Earths atmosphere we HEAR the first strains of
a haunting Central American FLUTE joined by a swelling
background of JUNGLE SOUNDS We descend further
through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY backlit by a setting sun

DISSOLVE TO
2 EXT JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR) 2

Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES a dark
OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW backlit by the
fiery ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN
heading slowly towards us floating as if suspended by
the rising heat of the jungle

Continuing to approach the shimmering object resolves
into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER its rotors strobing
in the fading sunlight Drawing closer the SOUND of
powerful TURBINES throbbing in the heavy air becomes
dominant overpowering

Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS the chopper
looms hard INTO VIEW pitching forward and settling to
the ground kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation

2-A INT COMMAND POST DAY (MAGIC HOUR) 2-A

Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
the large open windows the helicopter as it continues

to approach Before thé skids have even touched down he
SEES the first of the MEN dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
but carrying full COMBAT GEAR alight gracefully from
the chopper double-timing in close order to one side
the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
chopper

The man turns away from the window to a FIGURE hidden
in the shadows

MAN
Hes here

He turns back lowering a BAMBOO SHADE obscuring the
window

2-B EXT HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT 2-B

On adjoining PADS two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE in
the bg can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
BUILDINGS a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
FISHING VILLAGE

The post in a flurry of activity AMERICAN ADVISORS
shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers

Inside the chopper one man remains stretched out against
the bulkhead as if asleep He stirs sits up lighting
up a CIGAR With fatigue showing in his motion he leans
forward descending to the ground

A JEEP pulls to stop the man swinging casually into the
front seat tossing his GEAR into the rear With a
lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post

In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
approaches Reaching the command post the man alights
from the jeep heading towards the two men

Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the

door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER the team leader 38 an
intelligent and intense man He informally salutes
GENERAL HL PHILIPS 55 hardened close-cropped graying
hair his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
member of an elite commando unit in the US Army He
clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder

PHILIPS
(with affection)
Youre looking well Dutch

SCHAEFER
Its been a long time General

They walk up the stairs entering the palapa leaving
the other man on guard

INT PALAPA - DAY 3

Large two room concrete floor thatched walls and roof
Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen a naked
lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT MAPS and AERIAL
PHOTOGRAPHS Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion

Philips and Schaefer enter the room

PHILIPS
(growing serious)
Weve got a real problem here
something right up your alley

They cross to the center of the room to a folding table
covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
American highland jungle Philips leans over the table
circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
map

PHILIPS

Eighteen hours ago I was
informed that one of our
choppers transporting three
presidential cabinet members
from this charming little
country was shot down

(points to

the circled

area)
The pilots radioed from the
ground that they were all
alive Their position was
fixed by the transponder
beacon onboard the chopper

(points)
Here

Schaefer studies the map He looks up at Philips

SCHAEFER
Thats over the border
General

PHILIPS

(dead serious)
Thats the problem Apparently
they strayed off course
(pause)
Were certain theyve been
captured by the guerrillas

Schaefer looks up puffing lightly on the cigar
SCHAEFER
(quietly)

What have you got in mind
General

AQ92 3

PHILIPS
We figure weve got less than
twenty-four hours to catch
up with them After that
theres not much hope We
want a rescue operation
mounted tonight That doesnt
give you much time

Another puff on the cigar

SCHAEFER
What else is new When do
we leave

Philips looks at his watch

PHILIPS
You lift off in three hours
(pause)
Theres one other thing

SCHAEFER
Whats that General

PHILIPS
Someone else will be going
in with you

Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray

SCHAEFER
You know we dont work with
outsiders General

VOICE
(os)
Who said anything about
outsiders Dutch

Schaefer turns SEEING the outline of a figure standing
in the doorway of the communications room holding a
sheaf of PAPERS

Wearing pressed fatigues DILLON mid-thirties black
walks into the room

Although as rugged looking as the others his bearing
and grooming indicate hes been away from the business
of soldiering for sometime His quick intelligent eyes
reveal his current profession

A92 3

DILLON
Last time we danced it was
Lieutenant Schaefer

A grin breaks out across Schaefers face

SCHAEFER
Dillon you son of a bitch

The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
the hip as if to land a punchbut their hands SLAP
together in a gesture of friendship their forearms
bulging testing each others strength

DILLON
(warmly)
How you been Dutch

They continue the contest Schaefer has the edge forcing
Dillons arm slowly downward

SCHAEFER
Youve been pushing too many
Pencils Dillon Had enough

DILLON
(grinning)
No way old buddy
SCHAEFER
You never did know when to

quit

They look into each others faces each remembering
something from the past A moments hesitation and they
quit the contest They laugh Dillon slapping Schaefer
on the shoulder

DILLON
That piece of work you guys
pulled off at the Berlin
embassy last week was really
something Blew the entry
points on three floors and
neutralized the opposition
in eight seconds flat
Beautiful

SCHAEFER
Like the old days Dillon

3 3

DILLON
Also heard that you passed
on that little job in Libya

Schaefer looks at Dillon quietly considering him

SCHAEFER

Wasnt my style Were a
rescue unit not assassins

(smiles)
This must be good Big shot
from the CIA leaves his desk
to come back to the bush
Whats so important

DILLON
Those cabinet members are
very important to our scope
of operations in this part
of the world Theyre about
to get squeezed We cant
let that happen I needed
someone who could get the job
done quick and quietno
screw-ups I needed the best
The best So I pulled a few
strings at the State
Departmentand here we are

SCHAEFER
Go on

Dillon goes to the map

DILLON
The set-up is simple Dutch
One day job We pick up their
trail at the chopper run em
down grab the hostages and
bounce back across the
border before anyone knows
we were there Youve done
it a hundred times Nothing
out of the ordinary

Schaefer considers this

A92
A92 3

SCHAEFER
And nothing we cant handle
alone
Philips breaks in
PHILIPS

Im afraid those are your
orders Major Once you
reach your objective Dillon
will evaluate the situation
and take charge

Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon He still doesnt
like it

DILLON
Not to worry Dutch I
havent lost my edge Theyve
got a head start on us in
some real tough country
otherwise believe me its
a piece of cake

PHILIPS
Gentlemen were losing time
(to Schaefer)
Youd better get your men
ready
(pause)
Good luck Major

EXT TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT 4

Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS are
SEVEN MEN dressed in jungle camouflage soft hats and
camouflage face-makeup They wear no identity badges
or insignias The men are checking their WEAPONS
making last minute adjustments to their GEAR

The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
doors

bull of a man a 240 pound killer removes from his
shirtpocket a thick PLUG OF TOBACCO He looks across

Billy looks back shaking his head uncomprehending

HAWKINS

Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 6

Clearing another ridge the helicopters plunge into a
steep descent turning quickly into a DEEP-WALLED
CANYON the force of the turn accentuated by the
changing PITCH of the screaming turbines and the
biting of rotors into the air

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT 7

The men suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the
bulkheads lean forward nearly upside down in response
to the radical maneuver handling the situation with
ease

Blain holds out the tobacco to Ramirez who swats at
the offending object as if it were alive

Flares up into position over the jungle and hovers as
the SUPPORT HELICOPTER holds in a protective position
above

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT 11
Dillon seems comfortable with the men showing Ramirez

a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando

unit from the past

But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac who
regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
outsider Mac looks up at Blain his eyes narrowing

Blains massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew
He pauses eyes moving downward spotting his target

He hocks a thick vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
between Dillons legs and onto the floor a gelatinous
skein lacing across the toe of one boot Dillon looks
up his face goes cold and menacing

DILLON

Man thats a real bad habit

Dillon turns back to Ramirez ignoring Mac and Blain
who continues to stare at him Mac looks across at
Blain wide grins breaking across their huge faces
Cradled in Blains arms as if it were a part of his
body is a large CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE Blain looks
down at the bundle almost affectionately

The Pilots VOICE breaks in over Schaefers headset

PILOT NUMBER ONE

Looking up Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest
man who nods and in return passes thé signal down the
line

Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy METAL CONICAL DEVICES
attached to canvas bags filled with rope

EXT MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN) 15

A light shower passes through the trees The sky
clears REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage Birds
are beginning to SING but atherwise all is SILENT

The dense growth seems impenetrable but from a solid
wall of undergrowth a HAND appears and signals in a
downward motion

As if by magic the assault team materializes quietly
cautiously Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step
taking their cue from Ramirez the pointman Schaefer
highly focused and alert to every sound and movement
follows Ramirez as if organically connected

EXT JUNGLE HILLSIDE DAY 16

Descending the steep mountain slope the team encounters
an even denser growth of jungle at times moving by
instinct as they are often visually separated At one
point Schaefer checks his COMPASS flashing some hand
signals to Ramirez indicating a new direction Ramirez
nods and moves on Schaefer signaling to the rest of the
men

EXT JUNGLE CLEARING DAY 17

Blain in a defensive position sweeps the jungle slowly
with his MP-5 He steps back and turns checking
revealing in the bg the WRECKAGE OF A US ARMY UH-1H

Ramirez moves cautiously searching for trip wires
using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
door frames Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
slumped over the controls and then exits snapping
into and rappelling down the rope to the ground

He joins Schaefer standing in the fg They look

up watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit
searching through pockets and compartments Schaefer
turns his back to the helicopter

RAMIREZ
The pilots have each got one
round in the head And whoever
hit it stripped the shit out of it

Schaefer studies the clearing eyes always moving wary
He turns back looking at the chopper

SCHAEFER
Took ‘em out with a heat seeker
RAMIREZ
Theres something else Major

EXT DENSE UNDERGROWTH DAY 26

The hillside of a steep valley dark and foreboding
Billy passes by and halts removing his KNIFE With
his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE
severing it A thin stream of WATER emerges which

he drinks

Suddenly he stops letting the water drip to the
ground He quietly releases the vine and brings his
M-203 shotgun to bear listening intently Something
seems wrong He brings his eyes upward and stares
hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside

As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense intertwined
canopy he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the
JUNGLE a cacophony of BU2Z2ING and CLICKING

amplified in the sweltering heat of the day Unable
to locate a source to account for his anxiety he
relaxes moving on resuming the track

BILLY (MINUTES LATER) 27

examines the ground as he moves growing confused

and puzzled by what he sees before him He stops
scrutinizing the jungle probing the world around him
with his keen senses

HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up SEEING a
curtain of MOSS several feet away He takes a cautious
step forward extending his weapon He reaches

forward with his free hand touching the moss

Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
occurs He pauses and then with a sudden movement
sweeps the moss aside

A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
BIRDS rush past Billys body

Billys face seizes into a mask of horror his
expression descending into a state of complete
primitive shock his eyes staring transfixed inches
away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE
upside down completely stripped of skin

Reeling his body numbed by the sight before him
he stumbles backwards and stops

Vines threaded through their achilles tendons the
BODIES OF THREE MEN skinned and gutted hang
suspended in the thick suffocating air BUZZING
with insects

Billy turns away revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
INTO VIEW Schaefer directly behind him Ramirez
stares at the bodies now seen to be in the first
stages of deterioration strips of flesh torn away
by the birds and other scavengers In an almost
childlike manner he crosses himself

Schaefer moves into the clearing kneeling beside

a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS He examines
the clothing and then rises holding a DOG TAG on

a broken chain He reads the tag his face growing

Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from

his holster and cocks the hammer Grabbing the man by

The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
to the palapa still holding the pistol closing the

at the entrance way to the main palapa a Guerrilla
stands in the doorway giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
as they fall back inside

Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa Billy
drops directly in front of the Guerrilla

From the side unseen by Billy another Guerrilla
thrusts out with a knife Billy ducking backwards the
tip of the knife SLASHING his face With a lightning
move Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla
locking his elbow breaking the joint

Still holding the man he FIRES blowing the other
Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
weapon He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of
his eye He suddenly strikes breaking his neck
dropping him in a heap

Billy continues on racing down the stairs firing the

Meanwhile Blain is crouched next to a tree providing
cover Behind Blain at the edge of the camp circling
around from below TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a
grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain fragments
ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing
bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest one
piece tearing into his upper shoulder The hits have

no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL he
spins opening fire raking the two attackers with the
Mini-gun

Nearby Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run
diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the
ground around him

With a whipping backhanded throw he lets fly his

Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
which rip into the Guerrilla spinning him around
knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE scattering a

He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
the head with the barrel of his weapon The Guerrilla
is hurled backward crashing into the wooden crates and
to the floor

cautiously scanning around him for movement

Unseen by Ramirez Annas outstretched hands slowly
tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL lying loose on the
ground

on the jungle Dillon looks forward at

Billy his eyes riveted to the canopy above as he
unconsciously reaches to his throat grasping a LEATHER

EXT ANNA AND RAMIREZ - DAY 75

Sensing the danger has passed Ramirez releases his
grip on Anna As they start to rise Ramirez sheaths
his knife and unslings his MP-5 Anna still stares
hard into the jungle

Suddenly without even looking Anna with the trained
reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
all her might catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
head just above the eye opening a wicked gash
Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin

As Ramirez goes down doubled over in pain Anna turns
scrambling up the embankment running for the jungle

Ramirez CRIES out

yards away Hawkins closes in

her to the ground In a second hes on her his
weapon ready She struggles to her feet fighting
gasping for breath Hawkins holds the MP5 on her
looking at her almost pleading He doesnt want

to shoot her but he will if he has to

She looks at the weapon to Hawkins and then
hopefully to the jungle She stops staring hard
down the alleyway Somethingsuddenly she sees it

intersecting cover

EXT RAMIREZ DAY 88

Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES
Anna cowering in the bushes her blood splattered

face glazed with terror her eyes vacant He
approaches angry wary but the girl is so stunned

He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
into the jungle He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
on the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
around the clearing

He follows the trail finding first Hawkins’
blood-covered weapon and then a few yards later
the radio Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before
him A look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes

to his tace

Schaefer looking at Hawkins bloodstained equipment
lying at Annas feet looks up

SCHAEFER

Why didnt they take the
radio and his weapon

Why didnt she escape

Ramirez and Dillon look at the equipment and then
to the girl still numb with shock

They move out Schaefer moves into the jungle
searching He crouches at the base of a huge
MAHOGANY TREE covered with vines studying the
jungle He moves away from the tree and into the
forest looking for signs on the ground

Where he was sitting a DROP OF BLOOD falls Another
drop falls dripping from a leaf and above that from
another leaf Above that high in the top of the
tree SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles is
HAWKINS BODY his chest a gaping wound

He hangs there as if he were an animal field dressed
EXT BLAIN - DAY 92

Crouched in the undergrowth There is a movement in
the brush before him He wipes the sweat from his
eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire

The SOUND is growing closer Blain levels the weapon
A smile crosses his face

BLAIN
(whispers)
Come on in you fuckerscome on
in ‘ol ‘painless’ is waitin’

The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER Blains
finger moves closer to the trigger

Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves
startling Blain He relaxes momentarily as he
watches the animal scurrying from sight He
stands

SOMETHING grazes his shoulder a gout of BLOOD erupting
He starts to turn the Mini-gun held low ready to

from out of the jungle 75 feet away the Hunters
WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile He SCREAMS
as it enters his back erupting from his chest in an
EXPLOSION of BLOOD

EXT MAC - DAY 93

Has heard Blains cry He moves fast through the brush
He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes A wet SUCKING SOUND
Mac charges into the clearing In the instant before
the Hunter disappears into the forest Mat SEES a vision
so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
hallucination

The Hunters EYES flare momentarily from the green
before they vanish

Mac sees his friend lying on the ground his chest
open the powerful man dead

He OPENS FIRE with his M-203 belted shells slamming
into the weapon from the magazine at his waist
expending it in one LONG BURST

them

He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with
the fury of the terrible weapon Mac sweeps the
Mini-gun from left to right like a man possessed
mowing down the jungle

Suddenly as quickly as it started THE FIRING STOPS
The men move catlike into the jungle reloading
searching their nerves taut stretched to the limit
ready to fire again at any second

Mac is frozen eyes wide unblinking his breath
coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle

breech locked open GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber
and barrel Loe

Schaefer moves in front of Mac still staring into the

towards the body Anna looks at the body and then up
at Mac Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of
recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to
stare at Mac He turns to Mac

slight breath Schaefer turns sees her staring at

focused on something clinging to the leaves well off

closer reaching out hesitant as if drawn magnetically
to the leaves

Mac turns and walks through the camp stopping beside
a DARK OBJECT on the ground He kneels beside the

looking peaceful in death as if lying in state

Mac removes something from his pocket holding it in
his hand studying it

CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
metal with a strange copperlike patina its interior
bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT In the chamber is
Hawkins SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached

The light field suddenly changes as all connective
tissue flesh and blood are drawn away from the bony
structures with incredible force disintegrating as they
rush toward the sdes of the chamber

The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
Hunters hands remove the GLAZED POLISHED trophy from
the chamber He turns carefully placing it upon a
GLOWING SURFACE He touches the trophy gently feeling
its texture as a man might touch the hide of a big cat
He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE

with the trees and foliage The Hunter walks down a
CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT leading to an opening to the
jungle As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
from visible to invisible moving on into the night

EXT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 113

The mist has thickened the night alive with a million

JUNGLE SOUNDS ‘The team members sleep uneasily if at
all

Mac although weary stares hard into the night
waiting each small sound a potential enemy A LULL
spreads over the jungle animals and insects QUIETING
Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun

Billy awakens peering into the night Nothing

Suddenly a metallic CLICK a POP the SOUND of a
warning flare rocketing into the canopy A moment later
a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns illuminating the
camp

An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac

Mac spins hauling the heavy gun around just as
something crashes into his upper body driving the huge
man into the foxhole

A desperate battle for life ensues illuminated with
the strobing light of the descending flare Macs
enranged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
fill the night

Macs razor-edged KNIFE flashes in the light BLOOD
spatters his face as he attacks fiercely

Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
the foxhole their weapons ready

A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN
SILENCE Schaefer and Ramirez approach cautiously
Mac stands his face and clothes drenched in blood
some of it his his breath coming in rapid gasps He
looks at Schaefer whispering hoarsely

MAC
Got the motherfucker

As the flare breaks through the canopy dying out in
great flickering bursts the men stare down into the
foxhole A huge jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
of blood still quivering in the final throes of death
The flare dies out

Mac shaking from adrenalin breathing heavily looks
down at the dying animal

MAC
(incredulous)
A pigjust a fucking pig

Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar playing
the light along its massive hulk its razor edged tusks
gleaming in the light Ramirez appears by his side
looking down at the huge carcass

RAMIREZ
Holy shit Mac

Nearby unnoticed by the men Anna stoops her hands
still bound picking up an MP-5 from the ground She
turns looking for an avenue of escape running for
the jungle

But the forest looks foreboding and sinister She
stops staring at the jungle the moonlight reflected
off leaves like a thousand eyes For a brief second
she imagines she can see the Hunters eyes crashing
towards her the shifting patterns of light and dark
making the jungle seem to strobe like it is about to
rush in at her She freezes paralyzed by fear by her
memories of the attack

She drops the MP-5 to the ground
Back at the foxhole Schaefer and Ramirez help the
still shaken Mac from the hole Schaefer looks at

Mac at the huge gash across his chest

forth from the shadows Anna appears still frightened
seeking the security of the soldiers

From the darkness nearby Billys VOICE in a hoarse
WHISPER

Schaefer turns apprehensive something in Billys
voice

He walks over to Billy standing with a FLASHLIGHT
pointing to the ground They see Blains BODY BAG
slashed open covered in blood Ramirez appears

Near the empty PONCHO Schaefer Billy and Ramirez
are examining the ground and the trip wire to the
flare Billy stands turns to Schaefer

Schaefer turns and looks at Billy asking with his
eyes for a viable explanation

BILLY
Like a Hunter

Schaefer stares at him the words sinking in He

looks up reconstructing in his mind the possible
events of last night his eyes following the tree line
tracing the path of the intruder as he might have
travelled through the trees and down to the ground

He looks up at Billy

If it bleeds we can kill it

EXT ENCAMPMENT - MORNING (LATER) 115

Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
binoculars watching the tree line Mac moves past her
uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
hidden at various points with leaves and foliage In
a tree at the edge of the clearing Billy tosses an
uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to

a GRENADE wedged in the crouch of a tree

Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
through the underbrush and trees leaving a long unmined
corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle

At the corridors end where the rocks merge with
the jungle Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE
straining with every ounce of strength his muscles
bulging while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine

around the base of a tree The vine is attached to a
forty foot SAPLING arcing closer to the ground in a
gigantic bow with every pull CREAKING and GROANING
with tension With a last mighty heave Schaefer draws
the tree almost within reach gesturing to Dillon to
tie it off who does

DILLON

Im tellin you this little
‘boy scout stunt is a
Godamned waste of time

Ignoring him Schaefer rapidly drags into position a
NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines their
LEAVES still attached He carefully begins to cover
the net with leaves and debris Dillon watches him
in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly
picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together
a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER He holds up the framework
hurriedly examining his work before placing it on

the ground

SCHAEFER
Hell be looking for the trip wires
If were lucky he wont see this

Morning passes Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle
Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators

At the entranceway to the rock outcropping the net and trigger
are hidden beneath the leaves the framework of the trigger
bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the
bent tree

At the other end of the corridor several meters above the
jungle floor Schaefer and his team heavily camouflaged
nearly invisible lie hidden waiting The team members as
if hypnotized by the BUZZING din stare into the jungle
fixated alert

ANNA while waiting at the net

SLOW RACK TO Schaefers face Ashen HOLD Suddenly an
EERIE SILENCEmoves over the jungle

He whips his face forward The silence is SHATTERED by a

Behind him sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels the
others’ scan the jungle alert for the slightest sound or
movement covering him

Schaefer reaches the trap carefully skirting the trigger
hidden beneath the leaves He reaches the end of the corridor
moving out into the jungle He moves further away from the
others the silence crushing down on him He stops and waits
sweat pouring down his face his finger tightening on the
trigger of his M203 eyes scanning the jungle

He turns his back on the jungle waiting Nothing He moves
back towards the corridor reaching the net again waiting
listening sensing Nothing He turns around looking at the
jungle one last time his face measuring defeat and then with
carefully measured strides he walks back to the camp

Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement
Nearby Dillon starts to rise

Suddenly behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor
with a resounding SWISH and SNAP the NET explodes off
the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks
rocketing upward into the treetops

Schaefer spins the others leaping to their feet as
they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops a
large struggling bulge trapped within as a long
unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle

Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
the jungle and the bobbing net their weapons ready
Anna remains behind watching terrified from the rocks

They arrive under the net raising their weapons to
firebut before they can fire the entire net
EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves twigs vines dirt
and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON

EXT HUNTERS HAND AND ARM - DAY 117

As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates

Billy and Mac diving for safety But Ramirez following
the Hunters leap SEES too late the pendular movement
of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in

the ribs which lifts him off his feet hurling him
backwards like a rag doll his shirt torn open

exposing a BLOODY WOUND

An Anna runs to Ramirezs side the others still
stunned look upward frozen in shock SEEING THE
HUNTER clinging to a side of a tree flushed bright
crimson

Dillis is dumbfounded like the others rooted to the

Billy still at the foot of the log providing cover
turns to face the jungle

He lifts his head towards the trees feeling the
onrushing presence of the Hunter He shrugs off the
radio letting it fall smashing into the rocks
below

He casts away his weapon Staring forward he reaches
into his cargo pocket withdrawing a small
GREASE-PAINT TIN Covering his finger in BLACK

PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
again vertically down his cheeks Taking another
dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin over
his heart

He drops the tin withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE Holding
the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck
yanking it free with a quick snap He wraps the

leather thong around his hand and knife binding the
weapon and bag together

Staring outward as if in a trance he begins a low

to his feet Together they back up covering the

Suddenly from one side near Ramirez the Hunter
bursts from the jungle Ramirez seeing the Hunter
Spins raising his weapon to fire

Ramirez SEES the Hunters onrushing face still in
camouflage a montage of organic textures and colors
his yellow eyes burning

Whipping the MP-5 in the direction of the Hunter

he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunters

stumbles to her feet running into the jungle

In a blur the Hunter spins back hurling his weapon at
Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
rifle SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
and steel breech

The M-203 flies out of Schaefers hands as the Hunters
weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder laying open
the flesh

The M-203 hits the ground where it lies broken in half
useless

crashes through the trees at the canyons edge free

falling into space

With a sickening IMPACT he hits the branches of the
first trees lining the canyon and falis a hundred feet
through one canopy after another desperately grabbing
for limbs and branches to break his fall

He hits the bottom branches of the last line of trees
impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH knocking his
wind out

Semi-conscious he hangs momentarily before he slides
off fingers digging into the bark falling another ten
feet into the swiftly moving river

EXT RIVER - DAY 150

Weighted down by his boots and clothing Schaefer
struggles to stay afloat Gasping for air he ducks
underwater untying one of his boots He surfaces
fills his lungs and dives again releasing the other
boot He surfaces strips off his shirt and pants and
begins to swim towards shore stroking with one arm

EXT HUNTERS POV - DAY 151

As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
Schaefer has fallen The Hunter in close pursuit does
not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in

a spectacular LEAP streaking downward towards the tops
of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall

The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree
the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC
BLUR

The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another
moving through the trees as an expert skier might
negotiate a series of downhill gates

The Hunter leaps free of one tree bounds across twenty
feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree
affording a good view of the river below From his
vantage point looking down at the windening slowing
expanse of river Schaefer is nowhere to be seen

finally sucked into the undertow and hurled over the
top of a six foot falls driven deep underwater by the
pounding force of the water

EXT POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY 153

There is no sign of Schaefer Precious seconds pass
Slowly looking like a drowned rat he surfaces taking
a feeble breath He is nearly finished his energy
sapped But the water is calm and a few strokes are
enough to carry him near the shore His feet hit
bottom

He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
MUD SLURRY at the river bank With his last ounce of
strength he crawls panting and gasping into a
sheltered MUD OVERHANG collapsing beside the exposed
ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE his body completely covered
in thick gray MUD

Nearly unconscious he raises his head and looks to the
opposite side of the river scanning the bank There is
no sign of the Hunter He collapses in relief Hes
escaped

Suddenly the Hunter impacts the water throwing up a
huge SPLASH He stands up in the waist deep water As
the water streams off of his body his chameleon effect
rapidly changes struggling to match the shifting color
patterns of the shimmering water

His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
Schaefer lies helplessly trapped

The Hunter surges forward relentlessly closing in on
his prey

EXT HUNTERS POV DAY 159

Hes looking directly at Schaefer EXCEPT HE CANT
SEE HIM

He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM but because
of the heavy mud blocking Schaefers body heat Schaefer
registers in the Hunters vision as merely an indistinct
lump of clay unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
being

He scans the bank searching looking for heat sources
Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL
several times

BACK TO SCENESCHAEFER 160

disbelieving that hes still alive opens one eye
SEEING the Hunters feet move away his prehensile
spurs dragging in the mud He rounds a bend and
disappears heading for the undergrowth

Astonished he tries to raise up on his hands but a
sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to
collapse falling onto his side unconscious in the
mud

the Hunter were still attacking Schaefer rolls to his
feet and runs slogging through the THICK MUD stumbling
lunging forward gasping for breath

Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
POOL scuttling crablike into the chest deep water
Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
waterfall looking for movement regaining his senses

As the water settles he looks down SEEING the image
of himself reflected in the pool his hair and face
covered in THICK CLAY He stares mesmerized at the
image

He lifts his arm from the water his fingers wiping the
MUD from his face exposing a PATCH of SKIN He studies
the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
himself in the water SEEING the exposed skin He
stares at it a wave of realization rushing through

his mind He places the mud back on his face again
looking at his image

SCHAEFER
You couldnt see me

He looks up out into the failing light at the treeline
of the deepening forest realizing that fate has given
him a fighting chance Slowly a look of vengeance and
Hatred crosses over his face

EXT CLAY BANK - NIGHT 165

Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
fire block into a pile of KINDLING He removes a match
from the hollow handle of the machete also containing

a coil of PIANO WIRE GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES
He lights the shavings which burn with a brillaint white
light Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
until the flame dies down He feeds the fire with more
kindling fanning it with a leaf

He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
WIRE to ene end carefully wrapping it for strength
using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
wire where the nock of the arrow will fit

He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
an ARROW its tip fashioned into a series of barbs
rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
stone When finished he places the arrow on the ground
next to three other identical arrows

SCHAEFER
One chance thats all

166 EXT CLAY BANK - NIGHT 166

Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones
He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass He
scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF mixing

it with a sticky SAP holding it over the coals until
the mixture steams

Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison
holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
smokes He spins the arrows in his hands blowing on
the tips to cool and harden the mixture

Using the tip of his machete he pries open the casing
of one of the 40MM grenades discarding the warhead He
dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf
mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS

He opens the narrow tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
first aid kit of the machete handle fluffing it into a
large loose BUNDLE the size of a baseball He pours
the powder-mixture into the gauze mixing it into the
fabric

He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
pliable DRY LEAF closing it into a bundle binding it
at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass

He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH leaving
the head exposed forming a selfstriking FUSE

He codts the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
with more powder from the 40MM grenade He pokes the
fuse down into the leaf Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
GRASS he makes a large loop tying it onto the grenade
slipping the loop and grenade over his head

Finally using several sections of BAMBOO of differing

charge

Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools
surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks
their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
swept down at high water from the forests above

On a flattened section of rock Schaefer drags a large
section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW adding it to a growing
mound of FIREWOOD He kneels tending to a pile of
DRIED GRASS LEAVES and other tinder Using the last of
his precious matches he sets fire to the tinder gently
coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE
flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood

He stands staring into the rapidly growing blaze He
turns facing the canyon rim raising his weapons in one
hand From the depths of his soul a SOUND emerges
primitive and visceral as if from an animal in pain

He throws back his head and SHOUTS

Flies into the night lodging into a BRANCH of an

In a blur the Hunters arm streaks downward a dull

in a flash is up and running clutching his weapons
leaping from boulder to boulder He jumps down into the
lighted area below landing hard rolling into the
protective shadows of the rocks putting the loping fire
between he and the Hunters position on the rocks above

He moves forward darting to look backwards before
leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder
field below a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped
water-erroded rocks forming a giant stone AMPITHEATER
Shadows leap and dance across the boulders cast by the
bonfire from the plateau above

Schaefer crouches between two large boulders quietly
breathing through clenched teeth feeling the pain of
his now freely bleeding shoulder wound

Over the SOUNDS of the FIRE and the softly flowing
RIVER distinguishes a NEW SOUND one that brings fear
and a savage determination to his heart the rhythmical
CLICK-SCRAPE CLICK-SCRAPE of the Hunters feet moving
over the rocks somewhere above him

Drawing back on the bow Schaefer moves around the
boulder to his left heading towards the sound of the

Starting to move in this new direction he stops again
HEARING the sound now directly across from him
Listening he hears the sound again from yet another

Schaefer uncertain of where to turn waits Suddenly
he crouches and freezes HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
of a HUMAN VOICE softly echoing through the
ampitheater

Bow drawn trapped against the rock HEARING the sound
of the Hunter approaching from the left now the
right is helpless not knowing where to fire the
Hunters deadly strike only an instant away

Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand he
carefully releases the draw on the string reaching
to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE With painstaking
care he removes the grenade from his neck

Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
approaching SOUND he reaches down with the grenade
gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse
placing it against the rocks at his side

With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
the grenade snatching up the bangstick with his

His bow drawn Schaefer follows the blood trail across
the rock edging alongside a huge verticle boulder
The blood trail stops

He takes another step forward past a darkened ALCOVE

Schaefer spins SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
Hunter whirl and spring towards him

Schaefer in a bound closes the distance savagely
kicking the Hunters arm The WEAPON flies from the
Hunters hand CLATTERING to the rock

Before he can recover Schaefer follows with a karate
kick to the chest hurling the Hunter to the ground
his back exposed

In a flash Schaefer is standing over the Hunter the
bow drawn poised the blood from his open wound
dripping onto the Hunters back

The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back REVEALING his
face his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
blood The Hunters body ripples out of control
trying desperately to orientate itself to the
environment

Schaefers body looms over him MOTTLED and STREAKED
from his exposed skin blood oozing from the shoulder
wound his eyes like black sockets in his almost
skull-like face Seen from this perspective Schaefer
is a frightening horrible visage

shudders GASPING hungrily for air strugging to speak
From his throat Schaefer HEARS the feeble distorted

The Hunters strength seems to fade even more

Then suddenly with the last of his diminishing
strength he lashes out with one arm activating the
lethal razor sharp SPURS at his wrists

The Hunters coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
force his terrible spur ripping into Schaefers thigh
hurling Schaefer into the air flipping him over
sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
of water momentarily losing his bow He flounders
desperately in the water searching for the bow He
finds it just as

The Hunter rises slowly to his feet GASPING desperately
for breath He inhales deeply hungrily gaining
strength with each breath

Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter raising
his weapon to throw

In one totally instinctual movement Schaefer draws
back on the arrow to its very tip and fires

The arrow with a deadly THUD penetrates deeply into
the Hunters neck Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
as the Hunter clutches his throat dropping his weapon
An instant later and the Hunter is gone

With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks

Schaefer follows the blood trail deeper into the
incredibly dense vegetation ripping aside the heavy
growth plunging onward

Before him covering a narrow passageway is a huge
SPIDER WEB intricate four feet across Schaefer
starts to sweep aside the web With a sharp intake
of breath he halts inches from the web Something
is wrong

Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE A TRAP

He backs up picking up a hefty branch from the ground
He swings the branch with a mighty heave clenching

his teeth in pain The branch sails end over end

by the incredible images that crash in on him
TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames the hair
of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind
SKINNED BODIES some lying on the ground others hung
from the trees like Hopper and his men were

He turns back SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
the forest Within the force field he SEES the vague
nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunters ship

He approaches it wide-eyed his senses reeling with
astonishment and rage

From within the force field a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
appears the Hunters form backlit as he ascends the

up SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the
door begins to close

As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship the

increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ships drive
builds He enters the force field the door now
inches from closing

On the ground nearly obscured by the grass and leaves
Schaefer SEES the Hunters WEAPON lying where he

With the last ounce of his strength and with a BELLOW

the handle

In a FLASH of blue-white light the weapon becomes

Schaefer raises the weapon sensing its power and
function

In the final seconds before the door closes Schaefer
with a triumphant SCREAM fires the weapon

sideways accelerating through the door and into the

In the fg Schaefer a living dead-man streaked
with the alien ash rises up from a shallow depression
staring dumbstruck at the site

Breaking in low over the treetops the HELICOPTERS
flare up into position one preparing to land

As the chopper descends the crew standing in the
