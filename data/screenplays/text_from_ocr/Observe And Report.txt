SUPERIMPOSE OBSERVE AND REPORT

EXT MALL - DAY

HEAVY METAL MUSIC A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
see A couple of them smoke cigarettes One skater
grinds over a bench One kid ollies onto the hood of a
car Another slams into an old man and knocks him over

Meanwhile Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting He
looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max

The skaters ride past a set of construction cones One
skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
lot

The skaters soar past Ronnie who flips on the silent
orange siren and gives chase

As the skaters ride through the parking lot Ronnie pulls
up and drives alongside of them

RONNIE
(cop authority voice)
Pull over to the sidewalk NOW
STEVIE the leader of the skaters yells back

STEVIE
Fuck off Ronnie its just a
parking lot

RONNIE
Sir pull over to the sidewalk
Now

HECTOR another skater joins in

HECTOR
Leave us alone

STEVIE
Yeah skatings not a crime dick

RONNIE
Skateboarding is not allowed on
mall premises Pull over now

STEVIE
Were not leaving

HECTOR
Yeah fuck you

The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get
away from him Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
ensues

Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER Ronnie side-
swipes the skater forcing the skater to run into a trash
can and fall

Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER This time Ronnie
tries to hit the skater on the side again but he is too
fast Ronnie swerves trying to get him but he dodges
and ducks Ronnie hits the brake The skater thinks he
has escaped but looks up and sees that a car is in his
way The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
hood

Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
are left Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely

behind the two kids

Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind Hector
wobbles Ronnie rams him again Hector goes swerving
off and falls down hard

Ronnie doesnt break his pace and guns it toward Stevie

Stevie is good He turns and rides through cars ollies
over parking blocks and through pedestrians Ronnie
burns down the lane beside him

Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight Hes
in the clear

Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie driving in
reverse straight towards him Ronnie rams into the
skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass

STEVIE
What the fuck are you doing

RONNIE
I was driving in reverse and
trying to get you to flip into the
back seat

STEVIE
What

RONNIE
That way I could handcuff you
smoothly and take you in You
know never mind just get in the
goddamn golf cart

Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the
golf cart

INT MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

Ronnie is in the room with the monitors The skaters sit
across from him Theres a poster on the wall with the
security guard motto OBSERVE AND REPORT

Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie

RONNIE
It seems like we go through this
every day Whats it going to
take for you all to realize that I
wont tolerate this horseplay and
just do whatever you want to and
dont worry about the rules
attitude

STEVIE
Ronnie I hear what youre saying
and I just want you to know that

stickem up your ass you fuckin
rent-a-cop

The Skaters all start cracking up

HECTOR

The Skaters start laughing louder

RONNIE
Thats funny guys I try to bea
mentor to the youth but it seems
like you boys have gone straight
past boydom to the land of street-
hardened criminals Im left with
no choice You call me rent-a-
cop but I call myself the laws
right hand I see the crime
and I phone it in And thats
what Im getting ready to do right

writing

Ronnie fills out the paperwork sets the suspension notes

still counts

Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh

is watch out for this Pervert and
if you see him try to stop him or
quietly phone it in so we can
handle this discreetly

RONNIE
Hold on Mark Let me make sure I

authorization to handle this case
on my own

this whole investigation

INT MALL - OCHARLEYS - DAY

Ronnie walks up to OCharleys Its the one-step-up
restaurant thats in the mall Theres a BOUNCER out
front who watches over the store

RONNIE
You working the door here

BOUNCER
Thats what they tell me They
needed to hire a little security
here in case the drunks get out of
line or whatever

RONNIE
Kind of funny they thought they
needed more security here Ha
You do realize that if anyone gets
out of hand you need to call me
to handle the situation

BOUNCER
I work for OCharleys
the mall

RONNIE
Granted but you realiz
jurisdiction supersedes

not for

e that my
any and

all other forms of security when
under the roof of Carolina Mall

BOUNCER

You know I thought about getting
a job as a Mall Security

RONNIE
You did

BOUNCER
Yeah man I mean Im
extended vacation from

kind of on
college and

its just like I dont want to do
shit you know what I mean My

parents said I have to

work if I

want to live at home but I just
dont feel like doing anything
This was the easiest job I could

find I mean what the

hell could

be hard about being a bouncer ina
mall restaurant But now that I
think about it Mall Security
could be easier than this

RONNIE

My young friend you are sorely
mistaken Do you know how much

stuff Im in charge of

BOUNCER
No

RONNIE
A shitload Thats not

counting the parking lo

BOUNCER

even
t

Really I thought you just kind
of chilled out and called stuff
into the police

RONNIE
No way thats about like 75
maybe 82 percent of it Theres
so much other stuff

BOUNCER
Like what

RONNIE
Two words Friday Night

BOUNCER
What about it

RONNIE
Its crazy lets just leave it at
that

BOUNCER
Okay

RONNIE
Listen I like you but I dont
like the fact that youre
masquerading as an official in the
security world If youre serious
about a career in the security
world then perhaps I could look
into getting you a job on my
staff

BOUNCER
Oh yeah

RONNIE
Part of my job is reaching out to
troubled youths such as yourself
Its who I am

BOUNCER
Does it pay more than 650 an

hour

Ronnie laughs He leans over to the Bouncer and
whispers
in his ear
BOUNCER
(WHISPERING)
Seven even
Ronnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer
BOUNCER
Id say thats more than Im
making now
RONNIE
Hold on this job involves a
probationary period You have to
prove yourself worthy We cant
just hire any old Tom Dick or
Harry just because they want to
carry a flashlight
( )

BOUNCER
What do I have to do

RONNIE
You have to complete a term as
deputy You will answer directly
to me Your job will be to come
and find me if you see any
trouble If this works out then
I will phone the crime into the
police Now this will train your
eyes to spot various criminal
activity Once you have completed
your training you will be awarded
an official position on my
security staff where you will have
the duty of actually phoning in
crimes to the police yourself

BOUNCER
So basically I just do what Im
doing now and then youll get me a
job

RONNIE

For starters

BOUNCER
How long does this mentorship
last

RONNIE
Until Mark lets me hire another
guy

BOUNCER

Can I smoke while I work

RONNIE
Yes you can
BOUNCER
Sign me up
RONNIE

You keep that attitude up and
youll have no problem making the
squad

Ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the Bouncer a
mini flashlight

BOUNCER
Whats this

RONNIE
Its a flashlight Get to know
it Its your new best friend
Until you get your giant
flashlight Then that will be
your new best friend

The Bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket

RONNIE
Okay look alive soldier Deputy
time starts now No more slacker
attitude for you

Ronnie walks away but after he takes a few steps he
stops and turns

RONNIE
You know I remember when I got my
first flashlight

Ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind

Ronnie walks away leaving the Bouncer there alone

men
shake
MARK

Mark Talbert I manage the mall
This is Brandi shes the one who
saw the deviant

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Hello Brandi Are you doing
okay

BRANDI
Im really shaken up

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Yes maam Im sure you are after
all youve been through but Im
here to tell you that were going
to work together to make sure we
catch the person who did this

RONNIE

My name is Ronnie Barnhardt chief
inspector on the case and head of
Mall Security here at Carolina
Mall and this is my lieutenant
Dennis From one law enforcement
officer to another I just want to
welcome you and say that we will
do whatever it takes to coordinate
with your department in order to
bring this assailant to justice

The Detective pauses as if hes unsure what just
happened

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Great
(back to Brandi)
Okay Brandi Did you get a look
at the suspect

BRANDI
Yes I did

RONNIE
Did you get a blood sample

BRANDI
No

RONNIE
Thats a shame Would have been
useful

MARK
Go ahead Detective

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Thank you Brandi can you
remember anything specifically
What color was his hair Was he
tall or short

BRANDI
He was tall and skinny and he had
brown hair and it was real greasy

Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as
Brandi speaks Ronnie notices this and picks up some
paper and begins to write as well

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Was his hair long or short

BRANDI
It was long about to his
shoulders

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Did he say anything

BRANDI
No he just stood there and you
know touched himself

DETECTIVE HARRISON
What was he wearing

BRANDI
Just a brown trench coat

RONNIE
This is what I got so far

Ronnie holds up his paper Ronnie has drawn a crude
sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described but its
basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis

RONNIE
Whats yours look like

DETECTIVE HARRISON
I just wrote a description

RONNIE
Oh

Ronnie puts his sketch away

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Okay Brandi I think thats good
for now I think the best thing
at this point is to just follow up
with the other ladies who saw the
perpetrator yesterday and see if
they remember anything

BRANDI
What if he comes back

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Thats highly unlikely These
incidents are usually random and
unpredictable Im sure youll be
safe

RONNIE
Im afraid Im going to have to
disagree with you there
Detective By my math it seems
pretty clear that Brandis been
targeted

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Targeted What gives you that
impression

RONNIE
Well how about the fact that she
was the first employee to get
assaulted Not to mention the
fact that she is the prettiest

girl who works at this mall To
me it seems obvious that this is
some sort of methodical villain
that plans on returning to finish
what he started by murdering
Brandi

BRANDI
Is that going to happen

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Thats not going to happen

Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head yes

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Well dont worry Im on the case
and Im going to do everything in
my power to bring this guy down

RONNIE
Thats right Brandi youve got
the best team in law enforcement
working for you

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Look Ive got to get going
Heres my card Ill even write
my home phone number on the back
just in the event you need to get
a hold of me

Detective Harrison writes his number on the back and then
hands his card to Brandi

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Give me a call when you arent
working and Ill have you come to
the station to look through some
mug shots
(touches her leg)
Dont worry okay

BRANDI
I feel a lot better now
Ronnie holds out his hand

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What
RONNIE
Ill take one of those cards as
well
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Oh okay

Detective Harrison reluctantly hands Ronnie a card

RONNIE
Go ahead and write your home phone
on there as well in case I need to
get a hold of you

DETECTIVE HARRISON
You can just leave a message at
the station I check my messages
constantly

RONNIE
Sorry but Im gonna need those
digits If were gonna solve this

crime we need to constantly be in
communication with each other and
have an open door policy with
intelligence Brandi let me see
that card

Ronnie takes the car from Brandi and copies the home
phone number from the back

RONNIE
Cool Ill call you later with an
update
DETECTIVE HARRISON
Dont do that

RONNIE
Its no problem at all Were
brothers of the badge This is
what we do for each other

Detective Harrison takes off Ronnie looks around
happily

RONNIE
Seems like a good guy A little
green but still solid

The mall is winding down for the day and most of the
customers have gone home Ronnie walks through the mall
taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the Pervert

Nell comes walking up with her apron over her shoulder

NELL
What are you doing

RONNIE
Just putting these posters up

NELL
Youve been so obsessed with
catching this pervert Ive barely
seen you

RONNIE
Thats what its like when you
date the Head of Mall Security
The downside is we dont get to
see each other as much but the
upside is you get to brag to all
your friends

NELL
Well are you ready to go

RONNIE
Sure lets take off
INT RONNIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The LOCAL NEWS is on and they show an update on the MALL

INT MALL - NIGHT

The lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case
in the jewelry store All of the diamonds and gold are

picked up and pocketed Someone is robbing this bitch

cut To

INT MALL - THE NEXT MORNING

Ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning
coffee He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has
been broken into and robbed

RONNIE
Oh shit

Ronnie goes running down through the mall

INT MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

Dennis and Ronnie are sitting and Mark stands over them
Theyre looking at the security tapes

Detective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in
Ronnie stands up to greet him

RONNIE
Good to see you brother Looks
like the old team is getting
together to crack one more case

Ronnie gives Detective Harrison a hug

RONNIE
Im ready to go to war with you

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Thanks for waking me up this
morning Ronnie

RONNIE
Ive already checked the Security
tapes They didnt catch a thing
Someone must have broken in here
and turned them off

DETECTIVE HARRISON
My team just checked all the doors
and there are no signs of forced
entry Ive also checked out the
crime scene but we didnt see any

fingerprints on the glass The
suspect was probably wearing
gloves

MARK
That doesnt sound good How did
they do it

RONNIE

Laser technology

DETECTIVE HARRISON
My guess it was an inside job
Probably someone who has access to
eys like a janitor or a security
guard

RONNIE

Detective Harrison can I ask you
how long youve been a detective
for

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Im almost at the end of my first
year

RONNIE
Just as I thought a rookie

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ive been a police officer for
several years

RONNIE
Yeah youre a rookie okay Its
fine youll learn with
experience And when you do
youll discover that rule 1 of
law enforcement is that you dont
ever turn on a fellow officer
Now I know you would never
actually accuse somebody on my
Security Force of committing this
act of lawlessness

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Whoever did this would have to had
keys to the Security Room so they
could shut off the camera

RONNIE
Look my record speaks for itself
and as for Dennis well I can
certainly vouch for him Dennis
is one of the finest men I know
so just take my word youre
barking up the wrong tree Now
lets put this little squabble
behind us and get back to busting
the guys that robbed this mall

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ronnie nobody is accusing
anybody but I would like to stick
around for a while and interview
some of the employees

MARK
Okay but all I ask is that you do
it quietly so that the hoopla is
kept to a minimum

DETECTIVE HARRISON
I understand

RONNIE
I understand too sir

MARK
Ronnie you are to leave Detective
Harrison alone and let him handle
the investigation

RONNIE
No can do Mark When you
appointed me Head of Mall
Security I swore an oath to
protect this mall and aid in
bringing crime to its knees

MARK
You didnt swear an oath

RONNIE
To myself I did

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Ronnie on these types of
investigations its usually not a
good idea to have too many cooks
in the kitchen

RONNIE
Theres only one cook Ima
chef A cook and chef together
serving up justice

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Im gonna do this alone

RONNIE
Hot plates of justice

Ronnie stands up

RONNIE
Come on rookie Let me show you
the lay of the land

CUT TO
INT MALL - DAY
Ronnie talks to Dennis in the middle of the mall
RONNIE
Okay Dennis Ive gotta hang
with Detective Harrison
(MORE )

RONNIE (CONTD)
What I need for you to understand
is that just because Detective
Harrison is here doesnt mean
that you and me are no longer best
friends Sure Harrison would be
cool to hang out with He carries
a badge and a gun He probably
owns a boat Over time well
probably become really close like
brothers but for right now
youre still number one Now I
must leave you behind because duty
calls so chin up Radio if

you need anything

Ronnie takes off but we STAY WITH Dennis He walks
directly to the ARCADE Dennis puts a quarter in the
machine and plays pinball

suspect

RONNIE
No reason Look at him Theres

house and deport your whole family

Ronnie picks up a hammer

expensive and harder to drive but

the ped exit and slip through the
employ exit Not allowed The
two ped exits are to be used

DETECTIVE HARRISON
That corner used to be the worst
corner in this whole town It was
riddled with drugs prostitution
and gang violence It was
nicknamed The Crossroads

RONNIE
Shit Ive heard of that

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Thats right but myself and the
other officers worked on cleaning
it up for years so that the good
folks of this neighborhood
wouldnt have to worry about being
safe Yes sir that corner is a
testament to the fine police work
of our force

RONNIE
I dont know It looks pretty
shitty to me

DETECTIVE HARRISON
Well its a low income area
Ronnie Youre being kind of
prejudiced

him

KID

RONNIE
I place you under citizens arrest
for the crime of selling a
Schedule 1 Narcotic You have the
right to remain silent

Unbeknownst to Ronnie Gang Members start walking up
behind him Its like that scene in Training Day where
all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street
with guns and shit They come up behind him as he speaks
to the kids

RONNIE
If you cannot afford an
attorney one will be appointed to
you Now I guess we just wait

Ronnie turns around to look for Harrisons return but
instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of
pissed-off GANG MEMBERS

GANG MEMBER 1
Thats my little brother you got
there

RONNIE
Who this little guy right here

GANG MEMBER 1

RONNIE

GANG MEMBER 1
He works for me motherfucker

RONNIE
Is that so Well then it looks
like you got one less employee
because Im taking little brother

The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them
at Ronnie

RONNIE
(to the little Kid)
Free to go little brother My

Gang Member 1 puts the gun right up to Ronnies head

RONNIE

Ronnie goes down on his knees

RONNIE
No please Im sorry

Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod
He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick
Ronnies begging was a trap Ronnie pops up and begins
dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast
precision

Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja
Gang Member 1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker
punch busting his nose wide open

Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight
with Gang Member 1 He starts kicking Ronnies ass
Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member 1 starts stomping
Ronnie

Ronnie grabs Gang Member 1s leg and twists it He
takes him down Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins
beating him senseless

SLOW MOTION Ronnie stands up and looks around at the
pool of beaten bodies This is Ronnie at his most primal
and also at his best

CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

CHARLES
(BOUNCER)
Hows it going

MARK
You work at OCharleys right

CHARLES
Thats right

RONNIE
Mark I would like to hire Charles
here as an additional Security
Guard He would operate under me

criminal element we should hire
more security in hopes that we
would have a better chance of
catching these guys

MARK
Do you have any experience son

Charles kind

Ronnie winks

CHARLES
Not really

RONNIE
Um sir I have personally been
training young Charles for weeks
now in preparation for this day
The kid kind of looks up to me
Im some what of a big brother to
the little guy

of looks at Ronnie like hes crazy

MARK
Alright its actually not a bad
idea It might make our Security
more visible so we can give people
the illusion that were on top of
this

at Charles

CHARLES
Thank you Mark

MARK
Ronnie one more thing Look if
this crime doesnt come to an end
pretty soon were gonna have to
let someone go I mean youve
always done a great job for me

the one who wanted to be Head of
Mall Security and quite frankly I
just bought my wife a new
Cadillac so lets just say it

any crimes

RONNIE
No maam My record is totally
clean

PSYCHOLOGIST

Do you now take any illegal drugs
or have you taken any in the past

No maam I believe drugs are
the path to self-destruction and
should be purged from the face of
the earth with ruthless vengeance

PSYCHOLOGIST
Any prescription medications

RONNIE
Yes for my nerves A man in my
line of work has a lot of stress
to deal with If youve seen the
bloodshed Ive seen youd be on
the meds too I -- Where are you

PSYCHOLOGIST
That wasnt really the question

one Um heres one Do you

like a Rambo kind of guy A man
who rolls solo Taking care of
business on his own terms Kind
of like a Superhero or something

PSYCHOLOGIST
Why do you want to become a cop

RONNIE
I want to become a cop to help
people The world is a scary
place with lots of evil
everywhere See I have this
vision of evil trying to get at
the world from every angle and
there I stand at the top of it all
with my gun just kind of blowing
it away Just me and my weapons
cleaning up this whole town I
know I could do some good if I was
just given a chance and everybody
would be a lot better off

PSYCHOLOGIST
Uh-huh So what do you feel is
the greatest danger facing a
police officer today

Maybe Russian gang activity but
you know what I think Im gonna
have to go with evil on that one
too

Its been a pleasure Ronnie

RONNIE

RONNIE
It seems only natural that some
people would want to blame me and
truth be told I do put a lot of
that blame on myself But some
people might say that the cops are
to blame for not catching them
Some people might say that the
reason this happened was the
undeniable fact that I was under-
equipped and quite frankly
lacking a sufficient firearm But
not me I carry this loss alone
deep inside my heart

MARK
Good Because youre fired

RONNIE
(PLAYFUL)
Fuck you

MARK

evidence and old-fashioned common
sense as well as the latest
technology to deduce the criminal
mind Its what I do

smiling Ronnie turns around and sees them but tries to
