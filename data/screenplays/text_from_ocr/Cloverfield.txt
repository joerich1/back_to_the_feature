INT BETHS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN 1
WIDE ON THE CITY -- we’re looking DOWN ON MANHATTAN as the

MORNING SUN breaks through the skyline

And as the image adjusts slightly we realize we’re looking
THROUGH A VIDEO CAMERA We hear a MANS VOICE It’s
whispered quiet --

VOICE (0S)
Six forty-two am

His name is ROB HAWKINS

As he backs away from the window we catch a glimpse of HIS
REFLECTION in the glass And even though the VIDEOCAMERA is
obscuring most of his face we can tell he’s smiling --

ROB
Its already a good day

And as Rob SWINGS THE CAMERA AROUND we get a better look at
our surroundings -- we’re in a MANHATTAN APARTMENT -- floor-
to-ceiling windows opulent but not garish The tasteful
decor suggests a feminine touch

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the living room We hear Rob’s BARE
FEET quietly padding along the hardwood floors --

He approaches a SIDE TABLE covered with FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS --
they’re all of A GIRL (Beth) and her various friends and
family Rob’s hand reaches into frame selects one
photograph in particular

Rob and Beth at COLLEGE GRADUATION They’re both wearing cap
and gowns they’re both smiling for the camera Rob takes the
photo moves it in front of the other photos on the table

INT BETH’S APARTMENT - MORNING - LATER 3

We’re MOVING THROUGH THE APARTMENT getting a better feel of
the place Everythings still MORNING QUIET -- the silence
is peaceful serene We can hear Rob’s footsteps his steady
breathing the distinctive sounds of his hands on the camera

We turn a corner headed down a hallway Rob’s hand pushes
open a door leading us into --

INT BEDROOM - MORNING 4

-- the apartment’s bedroom And the BLUE LIGHT of dawn is
just starting to peek through the curtains As Rob enters
the room he angles towards the bed focusing in on --

Her She’s in bed fast asleep (Tastefully) covered by the
sheets And for a moment we just HOLD ON HER

This is BETH MCINTYRE

As the morning-light finds her face we can see she’s half-
smiling in her sleep She looks near angelic

Rob approaches angling in on Beth’s face He sits down on
the side of the bed his movement rousts her a bit Her
eyelids flutter open --

BETH
(half-asleep)
What are you doing

ROB (0S)
Nothing

Beth rubs the sleep out of her eyes sits up a bit Glances
at the camera playful --

BETH
Stop it

ROB (0S)
Suddenly she’s shy

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 3

BETH
Seriously -- I can just see this
ending up on the internet

She pulls the bedsheet tight around her making sure she’s
safely covered

ROB (0S)
Fine -- see if I care
(beat)
I’m interested in other things

BETH
(rolls eyes)
Like what

ROB
Like you I want to know
everything there is to know about
Elizabeth Anne McIntyre

BETH
You already know everything Rob

ROB
Thats not true After last night
we can still surprise each other

She flushes a little smiles --

BETH
Fair enough
(okay then)
What would you like to know Robert
Hawkins
ROB
Well let’s start with What do you

want to do today

BETH
That’s it You can ask me anything
in the world and you go with “What do
you want to do today”

ROB (0S)
Sure For starters

Beth studies him -- fine I’ll play along --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 4

BETH
Okay then
(thinks about it)
Id like to eat breakfast No -- I’d

like you to bring me breakfast
Here In bed I think I’ve earned

that
ROB (0S)
Really ‘Cause I think I’m the one
who did all the work
She raises her eyebrows -- are you kidding me
CUT TO
INT BETH’S BEDROOM - MORNING - LATER 5

A little later Beth’s shifted position a bit She’s eating
strawberries out of a bowl (clearly Rob lost the breakfast in

bed argument) We UPCUT right into their conversation --
ROB (0S) BETH
-- I’ve never been -- it’s not what it used to
be
ROB (0S)
I hear it’s fun
BETH
Sure If you want to score horse
ROB (0S)
That’s not the --

(wait)
Did you just call it “horse”

BETH
(laughing)
-- it’s not the same Coney Island

ROB (0S)
-- that’s not the point --
CUT TO
INT BETH’S BEDROOM - MORNING - LATER 6

REVERSE SHOT -- ON ROB He’s shirtless clad only in pajama
bottoms He leans back against the headboard uncomfortable
being filmed --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 5

ROB
from the neck up That’s it
That’s the only way I consent to
this

BETH (0S)
I wouldn’t worry about it Rob
Nobody’s paying for that online

Rob glances down at his body mock offended --

ROB
People would kill for this

BETH (0S)
Okay - what else

ROB
What do you mean

BETH (0S)
Other than cotton candy and tilt-o-
whirls -- what do you want to do
today

Rob stares at her with mischievous eyes for a beat Then --
ROB
Beth if I answered that question
honestly youd probably slap me

BETH (0S)
Try me

He reaches out playfully grabs her leg She laughs pushes
him away the camera shakes --

ROB
Honestly -- the things I’m thinking
right now -- I may slap myself
BETH
(laughs)

-- Rob I swear to god there’s
nothing you could say that would
possibly --

And just as she says that the VIDEO IMAGE fills with STATIC
and we ABRUPTLY CUT TO --

we swing around and follow --

A GIRL (mid-twenties) as she crosses through traffic on the
busy crosswalk She’s wearing a JAPANESE SILK DRESS her
hair is pulled back with CHOPSTICKS This is LILY FORD

JASON

important Stop trying to get out of
it --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 8

This is HUDSON PLATT

HUD
I’m already supposed to be working on
the sign

JASON (0S)

Yeah This is actually even more
important than the sign --

Hud clearly doesn’t like being on camera As he shuffles
awkwardly --

JASON
You’ve been to a wedding right

HUD
(shakes head)
Not since I was a kid I don’t
really get invited to a lot of things
like that

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 9

JASON (0S)
Okay well -- you know how at
weddings they have people give
testimonials to the videocamera

HUD
(thinks then)
No

JASON (0S)
(youre killing me)
Take this camera go around the
party and film everyone wishing Rob
good luck

HUD
(deer in headlights)
That sounds like a lot of
responsibility Jason I don’t
know

JASON (0OS)
It’s important We’ll need you to
talk to everyone Hud
(beat)
We’‘ll need you to talk to Marlena

Hud’s eyes dart towards the camera Wait --

HUD
Marlena’s gonna be here

LILY

Robert Hawkins I can’t believe
youre leaving me To take care of
Jason By myself And this is your
fault in the first place -- if you

raises voice)
Madly in love with a buffoon

JASON (0S)
I’m standing right here

LILY
(back to camera)

But I think of you as my brother and
I hope you think of me as a sister

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 12

As Lily talks IN THE BACKGROUND behind her the front door
opens and A WOMAN enters the apartment --

Hud’s camera drifts off to the side as he angles towards THE
WOMAN Cutting-edge stylish a clear air of superiority
about her This is MARLENA DIAMOND

Lily continues not noticing Hud’s focus is drifting --

LILY
which means you have to check in
with me from time to time
(getting choked up)

I know this is an amazing job for
you And I know this is what you
need right now but that doesn’t

mean I have to like it
Hud’s starts to ZOOM IN on Marlena Lily’s barely in frame --

JASON

This is a good thing right -- you

HUD (0S)
We are celebrating

JASON
Exactly but instead of a “Rob’s
Going Away” party this should be a
“Rob Slept With Beth” party

HUD (0S)
That’s a way better party

ROB
It’s not like that -- there’s no
“Beth and me” It was just a spur

of the moment thing
(off their looks)
We went out drinking to celebrate the

new job and then next thing you
know we were in bed together
Wham wham wham -- there’s a pounding on the bathroom door

We hear a male voice (Charlie’s) yelling from outside --

debris hit They emerge from the debris like GHOSTS

They’re COVERED in grey soot -- many of them in DAZED SHOCK -

Hud angles towards A WOMAN -- she’s covered in soot emerging
from the haze As she stumbles forward clearly in shock it

we ZOOM IN we realize we’re looking at what’s left of the
Statue of Liberty Her head has been torn clean off -- claw
marks scar her upper torso In the Harbor beside her we see
the FLAMING WRECKAGE OF THE OIL TANKER

ON THE HORIZON -- we catch glimpses of COAST GUARD
SPOTLIGHTS The boats seem to be racing right towards us

WHOOSH -- A HELICOPTER races by overhead It’s flying low --
the ROTOR WASH kicks up wind around them people in the crowd
CRY OUT involuntarily --

Hud widens out swings the camera around to FIND ROB in the
crowd next to him Rob’s distracted trying his phone again
As he glances at Hud --

ROB
Why are you still filming

HUD (0S)
I don’t know People are gonna want
to know how this all went down

ROB
(after a beat)
You could just tell them After we
get out of this

And just that hint of optimism seems to lift Hud’s spirits

HUD (0S)
Wouldn’t work People are gonna need
to see this
(beat)
And nobody ever listens to me anyway

to the edge of the walkway desperate to hear his phone --

Beth -- calm down -- I can’t --
(tries to listen)
Where are you Beth --

And Rob’s listens his face goes WHITE --

ROB
(into phone)
What do you mean you can’t move

RUMBLE Just as Rob says that THE WHOLE BRIDGE SHAKES His
eyes go wide with panic as he tries to keep his balance --

BELOW US -- a WAVE OF SCREAMS ERUPTS from the bottom level
As though people can see something TERRIFYING -- Hud swings
the camera over the side looks down But all he can see are
PEDESTRIANS racing away in PANIC from the south side of the

bridge -- beside Hud we can hear Lily screaming --
LILY (0S)

beside Lily glancing at Hud with TERROR in her eyes --

UP AHEAD -- we see Jason fighting his way BACK THROUGH THE
CROWD towards us -- AND JUST THEN BEHIND HIM --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 51

LILY (0S)
JASON
THE HAND smashes down -- WHAM -- and --
CRUSHES JASON INTO THE PAVEMENT

The hand RIPS RIGHT THROUGH THE WALKWAY Jason’s body
disappears in a flash of pulverized cement and blood --

WWWHH-CRACK -- above us -- SUSPENSION CABLES SNAP the ground
LURCHES as the WALKWAY IS TORN IN HALF --

THE SHOCKWAVE knocks Hud to the ground -- ALL AROUND US -- we
hear BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS of hysteria -- Hud struggles to
stand -- he swings the camera towards --

THE BRIDGE There’s now an ENORMOUS HOLE torn right through
the middle of it We catch glimpses of people and cars
PLUMMETING OFF THE BRIDGE into the water below --

The ground LURCHES VIOLENTLY again -- Hud turns -- camera
catches a glimpse of --

LILY She’s on the ground -- staring at the spot where Jason
used to be -- SCREAMING HER HEART OUT --

As she struggles to stand Rob’s beside her a similar look
of SHOCK and HORROR on his face --

AROUND THEM -- the FRENZIED CROWD is racing to get off the

bridge -- Rob’s holding Lily back -- pulling her away from
the chaos -- Hud moves towards them --
HUD (0S)
C’MON --
EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 85
Hud RACES WITH THE CROWD away from the destruction -- MOVING

AT TOP SPEED as fast as he can -- the ground SHAKES
VIOLENTLY -- we’re in the center of a MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE --

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 86
Still RACING AWAY -- ALL AROUND US -- the horrible SCREECH of

metal and concrete being ripped in two -- PEOPLE SCREAMING --
we hear Hud’s TERRIFIED BREATHING --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 52

EXT STREET - NEAR BRIDGE - NIGHT 87

UP AHEAD -- we catch a glimpses of ROB and LILY -- they’re
running for their lives with the crowd --

SSCCCCCRRRRR -- the screech of buckling metal fills the air --
Hud swings the camera around -- as he does so we see Marlena
race by us -- TERROR on her face --

Hud angles back TOWARDS THE BRIDGE -- it’s hard to get a good
view -- TERRIFIED CROWDS are racing towards us -- but rising
above them we can see --

The Bridge’s TOWER And it’s slowly TOPPLING OVER --
SSCCCCRRR -- it disappears out of view as it FALLS -- Hud
spins back around keeps moving --

EXT STREETS - NIGHT 88

Hud ROUNDS A CORNER still racing at top speed We pass
people who are standing still staring in horror at the

bridge spectacle We get the sense we’re out of immediate
danger -- but Hud keeps running --

EXT STREET - NIGHT 89
WAY UP AHEAD -- off to the side of the street -- we see Rob
Lily and Marlena have stopped -- Hud’s moving towards them --
EXT STREET INT ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT 90

Note the following sequence will take place in ONE SHOT

Were moving through the crowd headed towards our people
As we APPROACH we can hear LILY’S PAINED CRIES Rob’s
holding her tight in his arms -- she’s sobbing hysterically --

We can hear Hud trying to catch his breath As he gets
close we see Lily nearly BUCKLE in Rob’s arms -- it’s as
though her legs give out entirely -- between SOBS --

LILY
-- what was that -- what was that --
Marlena tries to help -- but Lilys a wreck -- she pushes
Marlena and Rob away -- backs against the wall behind her --

holds her head in her hands -- the TEARS nearly choking her --

LILY
-- please -- what happened --
somebody please tell me what
happened --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 53

Hud angles the camera towards Rob He’s taken a few steps

away He’s staring forward Blank expression on his face
There’s something EERIE about it -- he’s so deeply IN SHOCK
that he seems to have disconnected from the world entirely

Chirp We hear a noise It’s a quick beep barely audible
In fact nobody even reacts to it

LILY
-- it just came from nowhere -- he
didn’t see it -- he didn’t even see
it -- he was there and then he was

gone --
(through sobs)
What was that What just happened

Marlena crouches next to Lily --

MARLENA
I don’t know I don’t know
Hud angles back TOWARDS ROB -- he’s still standing in the
middle of the street With THAT LOOK on his face -- it’s as
though he’s completely short-circuited
HUD (0S)
(trying to catch his
breath)
Rob -- Rob -- I’m sorry -- I’m so
sorry --
But Rob doesn’t respond Chirp We hear THAT SOUND again
HUD (0S)
Rob -- are you okay man Rob

Rob doesn’t say a thing Just stands there Shell-shocked

HUD (0S)
Rob

CRASH Just then the sound of a WINDOW SHATTERING jolts
Hud He swings the camera --

ACROSS THE STREET -- we see SEVERAL PEOPLE kicking in the
door of a corner ELECTRONICS STORE LOOTERS immediately
storm the place --

Hud swings the camera back to the group -- Marlena’s glancing
out at the CHAOS building in the streets She looks at Hud --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 54

MARLENA
We can’t stay here
Chirp There’s that sound again Hud swings the camera back
towards Rob --
HUD (0S)
Rob we gotta get moving It’s not

safe here We gotta --
(trying to think)
I don’t know We could go up try

the Williamsburg Or try to cross
to the other side try the Tunnel
or something -- I don’t know I

don’t know --

(beat)
But she’s right -- we can’t stay
here -- we gotta do something
Chirp Hud HOLDS ON ROB It’s not even clear if Rob’s

hearing Hud right now --

HUD (0S)
What do we do Rob

AROUND THEM -- we can hear the distant sounds of people’s
SCREAMS the dull thudding of what sounds like EXPLOSIONS --

Chirp There it is again Only this time --

Rob seems to recognize it In fact the sound seems to roust
him slightly He glances down reaches into his pocket --

And pulls out his phone As he flips it open realizes --

ROB
(almost to himself)
Theres a message

Rob hits a button on his phone trying to playback but then --
Chirp Rob tenses as he realizes THAT NOISE he’s been
hearing is the sound of his battery dying --

ROB
No --

He tries to dial again but -- Ch-chirp The phone DIES
OUTRIGHT

ROB
No --

AQ1

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 55

We hear his breath catch in his throat -- PANIC building in
his chest as he tries to hold himself together His eyes
dart up glances around -- what do I do what do I do

And then suddenly without warning --
Rob turns and starts walking away

HUD (0S)
Rob --

Its like he’s in a trance We can hear Rob mutter to
himself as he passes Hud --

ROB
My phone’s dead

Hud swings the camera towards Marlena and Lily Marlena‘s
looking at Rob in disbelief --

MARLENA
Where are you going
(glances at Hud)
What’s he doing
Hud turns to FOLLOW ROB But Rob’s moving fast making a
beeline right towards the ELECTRONICS STORE As Hud hurries
to catch up we see LOOTERS emerging from the store --
Two guys are carrying a FLATSCREEN TELEVISION Another
person is racing out with a STEREO Rob walks right by them
Doesn’t even seem to notice

HUD (0S)
Rob what are you doing Wait --

As they approach the entrance --

HUD (0S)
Uh Rob this store’s closed

Rob walks right inside passing looters on the way out Hud
hesitates for a moment then follows his friend --

INT ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT A91

-- inside the store As Rob makes his way down the aisles
passing looters

HUD (0S)
Rob -- seriously --

They pass SEVERAL TELEVISIONS mounted on the wall --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 56

HUD (0S)
We shouldn’t be h--

And Hud stops in his tracks angles towards the TELEVISIONS
as he realizes --

There are NEWSCASTS playing on the screens

ON THE FIRST TELEVISION -- we see FOOTAGE of the BROOKLYN
BRIDGE A news shot shows us a GIANT HOLE torn right through
the center of the structure

But it’s the SECOND TELEVISION that catches Hud’s
attention

THE NEWS BANNER reads “CREATURE ATTACKS NEW YORK”

ON THE SCREEN a helicopter shot is looking down on the city
through the alleys of SKYSCRAPERS And there behind one of
the buildings is --

THE MONSTER

It’s hard to make it out clearly -- it’s dark we get the
sense the helicopters don’t want to get too close But as
their spotlights flare across it we see enough to know --

That’s a creature all right It’s ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS -- as
big as the skyscrapers around it if not BIGGER Its massive
body scrapes against a nearby building sending DEBRIS
EVERYWHERE --

HUD (0S)
Oh jesus

RUMBLE Hud jerks surprised and swings the camera towards
the front of the store --

THROUGH THE DOORS -- we can see a convoy of MILITARY HUMVEES
and TROOP TRANSPORTS racing past us down the street --

Hud swings the camera back TOWARDS THE TELEVISIONS We see A
LOOTER has stopped whatever he was doing and is now watching
the television with HUD --

On the first screen -- we see a FIELD REPORTER standing
behind what looks like a MILITARY BLOCKADE --

On the second screen -- the helicopters angling around

trying to get a better vantage point of the MONSTER Hud
reaches forward TURNS THE VOLUME UP on both screens --

B91

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 57

SECOND SCREEN (VO)
-- confirm only that it emerged from
the waters south of Manhattan a
little over --

FIELD REPORTER
-- currently in the process of
evacuating the city hoping to
contain the creature to the
BaxterBayard area --

Hud glances over at the Looter next to him --

HUD (0S)
That’s not far -- that’s only like
what twenty twenty-five blocks from

here

The Looter just glances at him nods As the NEWSCASTS
continue Hud turns back towards the front doors Curiosity
getting the best of him he heads --

EXT STREETS - NIGHT BOL

-- back OUTSIDE DOWN THE STREET -- we see a CONVOY of
military vehicles -- they’re rolling slowly towards us
HERDING PEOPLE away from the north part of the city --

A VOICE barks orders over a TRANSPORT’S LOUDSPEAKER --

LOUDSPEAKER
-- continue south -- no citizens
will be allowed north of Canal for

any reason --

Hud heads towards them ducks round the corner Angles the
camera DOWN THE STREET --

IN THE DISTANCE -- we can see the same HELICOPTER
SEARCHLIGHTS we saw on the NEWSCASTS We recognize one of
the SKYSCRAPERS we see the same TRAILS OF DEBRIS snaking up
into the sky We hear the faint RUMBLINGS of the buildings
shaking -- the noise has almost become commonplace --

Hud ZOOMS IN we CATCH A GLIMPSE of movement behind the
skyscraper It looks like the GHOSTLY WHITE SILHOUETTE of
the creature one of the SPOTLIGHTS hits it just as --

THE MONSTERS TAIL whips up above the skyscrapers

col

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 58

Hud GASPS Behind him we hear the military convoy getting
closer the LOUDSPEAKER BLARING Hud turns hurries round
the corner and back into --

INT ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT col
-- the store DOWN THE AISLES towards the back of the

store we can see Rob tossing aside boxes of CELL PHONES and
ACCESSORIES as he searches for the right battery --

HUD (0S)
Rob -- we don’t want to be here right
now --
But Rob doesn’t even look up -- he’s intense on a mission

As Hud hurries down the aisle towards him --

He passes the TELEVISIONS And a few more LOOTERS are now
watching the screens with RAPT ATTENTION Hud can’t help
himself -- he glances towards the screens --

ON THE FIRST SCREEN -- the helicopter has angled a little
closer -- we see THE MONSTER’S BACK -- it’s HUNCHED OVER
seems to be rubbing its body against a building -- We hear a
COMMENTATOR’S VOICE He sounds a bit flummoxed --

COMMENTATOR (0S)
-- at this point everything is pure
speculation --

ON THE SECOND SCREEN -- we see a MILITARY OFFICER trying to
move the FIELD REPORTER away from the BLOCKADE She’s trying
to finish her report --

FIELD REPORTER
-- will not comment on the course of
action but it’s clear there’s a
sizable mobilization of --

Hud angles back towards the FIRST SCREEN The HELICOPTER
SHOT has zoomed in a bit We can see what looks like FLAKES
OF SKIN falling off the monster’s back --

COMMENTATOR (0S)
-- perhaps some sort of symbiotic
relationship with the creature A
parasite if you will --

The shot ZOOMS IN following a flake down to the ground And
as the flake hits the street it MOVES

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 59

ANCHOR (0S)
OH -- whatever it is it’s moving --

The image is blurry but we can see PIXELATED MOVEMENT as the
spider-like parasite skitters across the ground We see it
race towards the MILITARY PERIMETER --

ON THE SECOND SCREEN -- we see the camera SHAKE as GUNFIRE
rings out --

ON THE FIRST SCREEN -- the parasite LAUNCHES ITSELF at the
soldier WWWSSHHLLK The soldier SCREAMS -- though the
image is blurry we get the sense that something VIOLENT and
HORRIBLE is happening to him --

COMMENTATOR (0S)
Oh my god --

And the first screen ABRUPTLY CUTS to the NEWS STUDIO The
Anchorman unprepared stares back at the camera stunned --

ANCHOR
(horrified)
Uh

ON THE SECOND SCREEN -- we can HEAR the FIELD REPORTER
SCREAMING and then it also CUTS to STANDBY FOOTAGE --

MARLENA (0S)
Whatare you quys doing

Hud swings the camera to FIND MARLENA as she pulls Lily
through the front doors --

MARLENA
We have to get out of here -- like
now Where’s --
(sees over Hud’s shoulder)
Rob

They hurry RIGHT PAST HUD He turns to follow them In the
back of the store we SEE ROB tearing open a CELL PHONE
PACKAGE He yanks out the battery --

MARLENA
Rob -- we gotta go The military’s
evacuating this whole place --

Rob slams the battery into his phone Checks the signal --

it’s good He turns moves towards the back corner Where
it’s quiet Marlena throws a glance towards Hud --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 60

HUD (0S)
Don’t look at me -- I’ve tried --

MARLENA
Rob -- it’s the army -- and that
thing’s right over --

Rob flashes Marlena a look that stops her in her tracks --

ROB
Quiet
Rob hits a button holds the phone to his ear Tries to
listen Looks frustrated -- this isn’t working

He holds the phone down hits a button Cranks up the
volume We realize -- he’s putting it on SPEAKERPHONE --

There’s a moment of silence -- Rob Hud Lily and Marlena
all stare at the phone waiting in tense anticipation then --
BEEP -- the message starts playing --

And BETH’S VOICE fills the air --

BETH
(over phone)
Rob -- Rob -- I can’t -- oh god -- I
can’t move --

She sounds PANICKED HYSTERICAL --
BETH
(over phone)
Rob -- it fell -- my apartment -- the
whole wall fell on me --

Hud’s ANGLING IN ON ROB as Beth’s message plays --

BETH
(over phone)
-- I can’t -- I’m bleeding and I

can’t move --
C-CRACK -- Just then A VIOLENT SOUND rings out over the
phone -- it sounds like concrete tearing in half -- Beth
SCREAMS -- we hear her PANICKED BREATHING as she gasps --
BETH
(over phone)
Oh god -- Rob -- Rob -- ROB --

And it CUTS OUT

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 61

We’re CLOSE ON ROB as the message ends As we HOLD ON HIM
we can see it all play out on his face as he stares at the
phone -- the HORROR at what he’s just heard the building
PANIC in his chest the overwhelming sense of HELPLESSNESS --

Nobody says a word Nobody knows what to say

And Rob He just stares at that phone We see his jaw

clench we get the sense he’s fighting off tears his

breathing becomes more and more desperate

But then after a few beats something changes in Rob

We see him fight it all off -- it’s as though he doesn’t

allow himself to panic Right there on the spot he makes

up his mind Knows what he has to do We see it WASH OVER

HIM -- Rob sets his jaw glances up at Hud

As Rob stares at us we see COLD RESOLVE in his eyes and --
WE (FINALLY) CUT TO

EXT SIDE STREET - NIGHT 91

ON THE MOVE We’re FOLLOWING ROB -- he’s moving fast down a

side street out of the main flow of traffic Marlena Lily

and Hud are all struggling to keep up with him We UPCUT

right into their conversation --

HUD (0S)

Rob stops in his tracks --

ROB

He points down the street -- we can see the military convoy
herding crowds out of the city --

ROB

word for quite some time Rob looks at her eyes softening --

ROB

She holds Rob’s gaze her voice quiet but steady --

LILY

Rob studies her for a beat Then nods Turns to keep

walking Marlena throws her arms up -- is everyone insane
MARLENA

make it to her place there’s a
chance she might already be --

ROB

And the look Rob gives Marlena stops her cold in her tracks --

CUT TO

EXT ALLEYSTREET - NIGHT 93

Rob and Lily are up ahead moving quickly through a dark
alley Hud and Marlena follow As Marlena tries to get Hud
to listen to reason --

MARLENA

glances at him embarrassed --

Yet despite that Hud turns keeps following Rob anyway --
CUT TO
EXT STREET - NIGHT A94

As Hud and the others hurry to keep up with Rob a middle-
aged RUSSIAN MAN approaches them He’s BLEEDING from a wound
on his head -- DRIED BLOOD streaks his face --

He seems DAZED OUT OF IT He looks at Hud with HAUNTED
EYES Speaks to him IN RUSSIAN --

RUSSIAN MAN

the bodies out of the debris
There’s too many of them --

HUD (0S)
Rob -- WAIT --
RUSSIAN MAN
(in RUSSIAN)

Somebody has to do something

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 65

HUD (0S)

And the Russian man relents -- it’s as though he realizes
this is futile His eyes GLASS OVER He stares at Hud

RUSSIAN MAN
(in RUSSIAN)
Dead
(beat)
They’re all dead

And with that he shakes his head and walks off Still in
his DAZE For a beat HUD HOLDS ON HIM -- should I do
something -- but then swings the camera around realizes he
has to catch up with ROB --

CUT TO
EXT STREET - NIGHT 94

Further into the city Rob and the others crouch in the
darkness And though she doesn’t look happy about it
Marlena’s still with them

Rob motions for them to wait Hud angles the camera out
AROUND THE CORNER --

Down the street -- we see a convoy of HUMVEES AND TRANSPORTS
crossing the street Our group waits until they pass then
hurry across the street darting into another alleyway --

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 95
As they move we UPCUT into Rob and Hud’s conversation --

HUD tried calling 911 see if someone
else can get there

ROB
(nods)
Nothing All I get is that weird
beeping sound I’m guessing they’ve
got their hands --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 66

KA-BOOM As Rob says that -- the top floor of a building at
end of their alley EXPLODES --

Our people CRY OUT in surprise as fragments of glass and
brick RAIN DOWN They turn try to race away from the blast
down a SIDE ALLEY but stop when they see --

A MILITARY CONVOY -- TROOP TRANSPORTS and TANKS are moving
forward in formation We see them BEGIN TO FIRE --

Rob stops in his tracks not knowing where to go -- KA-BOOM
Behind us -- another explosion rings out -- it sounds like
MORTAR SHELLS detonating --

SSSSSSSSHRHHHRRROOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR

As we hear the monster’s ANGRY ROAR we realize -- the
military is mounting its COUNTERATTACK And our people are
caught right in the middle of it

ROB
GET DOWN

He motions for them to dive for cover We HIT THE GROUND --
crouching down behind a car as --

MORTAR SHELLS and GUNFIRE seem to RING OUT all around us As
we hear our people CRY OUT in terror Hud angles the camera --

DOWN ONE STREET -- from our limited vantage point on the
group we catch glimpses of GROUND TROOPS advancing

BOOM There it is -- the distinctive sound of the Monster
WALKING We hear the gunfire INTENSIFY we hear MORTAR
BLASTS SOLDIERS SCREAMING at one another --

BOOM It’s getting closer The car we’re hiding behind
seems to SHAKE a bit Hud tries to scream over the CHAOS --

HUD (0S)
We can’t stay here --

But the firefight is SO LOUD it’s unclear if anyone hears
him BOOM Hud shifts the camera a bit -- we catch a
GLIMPSE of LILY covering her ears CRYING OUT in TERROR --

DOWN THE SECOND STREET -- we see SMOKE and DEBRIS ROLLING

PAST WHOOSH -- FLAME BURSTS lick the sky -- as though
SOMETHING BIG just exploded around the corner

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 67

BOOM The car in front of us BOUNCES -- the monster’s close
Hud shifts sees a glimpse of Rob scanning the street behind
them -- then angles the camera --

DOWN THE FIRST STREET -- as we see GROUND TROOPS racing

forward -- but as they do so --

KRRR-WHAM -- a CRUSHED TANK comes flying at them -- it’s as
though the monster just HURLED IT AT THEM -- it CUTS RIGHT
THROUGH THE CROWD CRUSHING TROOPS --

Hud jolts -- we hear him CRY OUT in horror -- BOOM The
WHOLE WORLD shakes The firefight’s DEAFENING -- Panicked

Hud tries to swing the camera back towards the FIRST STREET --
realizes -- ROB’S GONE --

Hud turns around -- there’s Rob -- he’s pulling Lily and
Marlena with him -- looking at Hud -- SCREAMING AT HIM --
it’s so loud Hud can’t hear him --

Hud gets up HAULS ASS -- Robs racing forward towards --

A SUBWAY STATION As Lily and Marlena disappear down the
stairs Rob turns back towards Hud --

ROB
Hud -- COME ON --

EXTINT SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 96
Hud races forward the world SHAKING as the WARZONE explodes
around them -- Rob grabs him pushes him forward -- as they
dive down the stairs Hud swings the camera around looking
over his shoulder one last time to see --

The air CATCH FIRE above him as an EXPLOSION rolls over the

street outside The blast knocks them down the stairs -- Rob
grabs Hud -- pulls him down into the subway station --
INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 97

Hud and Rob race forward spilling out onto a SUBWAY
PLATFORM They fall forward to the ground -- we catch a
glimpse of Lily and Marlena next to them on the deck

Hud’s on his hands and knees -- they’re all GASPING FOR AIR
terror in their throats as they struggle to breathe and
breathe and breathe

not lulling anytime soon --

Rob glances at Hud frustrated Off his look --

HUD (0S)

Lily glances at the ceiling -- we can hear the dull violent
sounds of DESTRUCTION coming from the street above She
looks at Rob sympathy in her eyes but concurs --

LILY

Moments later ON ROB -- hes boiling with frustration just

starting to accept they’re trapped there when --
Beepbeepbeep Rob’s phone RINGS Whip-fast Rob reaches
into his pocket -- thinking it’s Beth -- but as he looks at
the display his face goes pale --

ROB

HUD (0S)
What

Rob

Rob doesn’t respond Stares at the phone as it RINGS
Glances up at Hud -- oh god what do I do Then after a
beat Rob steels himself flips it open --

ROB
(listens then)
Mom
(beat)
Yeah -- Mom -- I-I’m okay but
Mom -- listen to me --

He tries to figure out how to tell her this Then --

ROB
We were on the bridge Mom We were
on the bridge when -- yeah --

His voice wavers as he struggles with the words All the
emotion he’s been repressing starts to POUR OUT --

ROB
Mom Jason’s dead He was right
there when it hit and He’s dead

Mom

And he can’t keep it together any longer TEARS start to
spill over --

ROB
He’s dead

CUT TO
INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 100

Seconds later Rob’s a little further away Looks like
Hud’s giving him space But he’s still on the phone --

ROB
Dad -- Dad -- the phones keep cutting
out and I --
(beat listens)
Yeah -- Dad -- I am -- I --

Rob turns glances at the others

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 70

ROB
Yeah We’re okay
(then)
We’re getting out of the city now

He takes a beat Considers his words Then --

ROB

Later ACROSS THE STATION -- Rob’s now off the phone By
himself Lily crosses over to him Grabs him Hugs him
He goes weak as she holds him

CUT TO

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 102

Later Rob and Lily are now sitting against the wall on the
other side of the station We can’t hear what theyre
saying

Hud angles the camera -- he’s sitting next to Marlena
Somber As Hud studies Rob across the room --

HUD (0S)
I don’t know what to say to him
(beat)
I should say something but I don’t
know what to Say

After a beat Marlena glances at Hud Realizes he’s waiting
for a response But then she just shakes her head There’s

nothing to say

CUT TO
INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 103
Later Some time has passed Hud angles the camera towards

the ceiling As the sounds of BOMBING continue to ring out
we see dust and debris continue to shake loose rain down

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 721

Everyone’s quiet Shell-shocked We see Rob and Lily
sitting across the station Rob seems to be staring off at
the wall (we can’t see at what)

Boom The bombing gets louder And LOUDER BOOM The
station shakes Marlena cries out involuntarily Holds her
head in her hands Trying to keep it together And failing

MARLENA
I‘m not even supposed to be here

HUD (0S)
You didn’t have to be
off her look)
You had your chance back there in the
alley -- you could have left us
Marlena thinks about that Then answers honestly --

MARLENA
I didn’t want to be alone

Hud HOLDS ON HER for a beat Then in the background we see
Lily cross frame as she walks over next to Rob

Hud drifts towards them What the hell are they doing

CUT TO
INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 104
Hud’s on his feet approaching Rob and Lily --

HUD (0S)
Guys

ROB
- we could take the “456”

Hud ANGLES THE CAMERA to reveal Rob’s staring at A MAP OF THE
NYC SUBWAY TRANSIT

HUD (0S)
Yeah -- the trains aren’t running
right now Rob

ROB
No -- we could walk Look --

He taps the location on the map --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 72

ROB
Beth lives here -- 53rd and Park
And the 456 exits just a few blocks
from there It’s a straight shot
from here

MARLENA
You want us to walk the tunnels

Lily stares at the map Sees what Rob’s talking about --

LILY
It would only take us about thirty
minutes

MARLENA

You want us to walk the tunnels

ROB
It’s either that or stay here

A beat We hear the pounding SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION above
As the group glances at each other --

CUT TO
105 INT SUBWAY TUNNELS - NIGHT 105

OVER BLACK we hear --

ROB (08S)
It has a light on it --
HUD (0S)
Why does this thing need so many

buttons

CLICK -- Hud finds a light on the front of the camera It
throws a beam forward Rob blinks shields his eyes with his
hand It’s not much light -- just enough to see about five
feet forward

ROB
(shrugs)
It’s better than nothing
(gestures forward)
All right Hudson Lead the way

Hud swings the camera down the long dark subway tunnel

HUD (0S)

He looks back at the others Rob nods

HUD (0S)
Does somebody else want to film
for a while

Rob and the others glance at each other shake their heads
INT SUBWAY TUNNELS - NIGHT 106

Were walking slowly through the tunnels Hud leads the way
We UPCUT INTO CONVERSATION --

HUD (0S)
-- yeah got a better look at it on
the news when we were in the store
You were too busy you know stealing

merchandise

ROB
What did it look like

HUD (0S)
I don’t know -- like a giant
dinosaur or insect but more
monstrous I mean it had arms
and legs I couldn’t really see
its head

MARLENA

But you can confirm it has arms and
legs Wow Thank god you saw it

HUD (0S)
You describe it then --

MARLENA
I’m not even trying

LILY
Did the news say what it was

HUD (0S)

No I mean I don’t think so I
couldn’t really hear

It was loud -- people were stealing

-- the ocean’s big dude They found
a fish a couple years ago in
Madagascar that they thought had been
dead for centuries

ROB
-- so it’s been down there this whole
time and what nobody noticed

HUD (0S)
Sure Maybe it erupted from an ocean
trench Or a crevasse
(off their looks)
It’s a theory For all we know --
it’s from another planet and flew

here

MARLENA
Like Superman

HUD (0S)
Yeah just like --

(beat)
You know who Superman is

MARLENA
Oh my god You too We’re totally

Later still It seems like we’ve been walking for a while
Nobodys saying much as they trek through the dark creepy
tunnels After a while just to break the silence --

HUD (0S)
Remember a couple years ago when that
guy was lighting homeless people on
fire in the subways

ROB
Jesus Hud --
HUD (0S)
What
ROB
Maybe not the best conversation for
down here
HUD (0S)
Right

I just can’t stop thinking how scary
itd be if a flaming homeless guy
came out of the dark right now

ROB
Hud -- seriously --

RUMBLE -- as he says that -- a MASSIVE QUAKING SOUND rings
out from the tunnels behind them Everyone stops in their
tracks looks behind them tense --

What was that

They wait in silence When no further sound comes --

walk up ahead Hud’s almost EAVESDROPPING ON THEM --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 76

ROB
can’t stop thinking that the last
thing I said to her was “Good luck
tonight Travis”

LILY
(quietly)
Theyre just words Rob They don’t
matter
(thinks about it)
I don’t have any idea what the last
thing I said to Jason was

ROB
It’s different

LILY
Why

ROB

Because Jason knows you love him

Lily holds Rob’s gaze fights off tears Nods Reaches out
and takes Rob’s hand As they continue walking forward Hud
drifts back just a bit to FIND MARLENA who’s looking at her

feet not paying attention to any of this --

MARLENA
This is disqusting

Hud angles down to reveal Marlena is looking at --
RATS A few of them are scurrying past us down the tracks
MARLENA
(glances at Hud)
If I get rabies youre taking the
stomach shots with me

As Hud surveys the rats --

HUD (0S)
Okay It’s a date

MARLENA
It’s absolutely not a date

as EVEN MORE RATS race past The rats all seem to be coming
from the tunnel behind our people

HUD (0S)
Look at all of them --

MARLENA
It’s New York It’s the subway
This is why we take cabs

HUD (0S)
They’re all going the same direction

ROB
It’s like they’re running away

Lily looks back down the tunnels behind her As our group
glances at each other --

CUT TO

Were NOW JOGGING through the tunnels Everyone’s TENSE --
We can feel PANIC starting to build --

HUD (0S)
How much further

ROB
I don’t know -- let’s hop out at the
next platform -- see where we --

CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK -- BEHIND THEM -- an unnatural
CLICKING SOUND echoes through the tunnels It stops them
COLD As they look back --

MARLENA
You guys hear that right

Hud angles the camera down the tunnel behind them but the
small light makes it impossible to see more than a few feet

CLICK CLICK CLICK -- it seems to be getting closer

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 78

ROB
(realizing)
Night vision Hud -- the camera’s
got night vision See what you can
see --
HUD (0S)

How do I do it

ROB
Should be a button on the side
there -- near the “on” button --

HUD (0S)
Hang on --

A beat as Hud tries to find the switch We’re looking
forward staring into darkness and then --

Click

The camera switches to NIGHT VISION Instantly the world
becomes BRIGHT GREEN And that CLICKING SOUND

It’s coming from the PARASITES

There’s five of them They’re on the floor the walls
ceiling Less than ten feet away Just stopped staring at
us As though they’ve been stalking us like prey

HUD (0S)
OH GOD --

As the parasites HISS and start to lunge forward Hud swings
the camera around We catch a glimpse of our people looking
panicked and confused --

BACK TO REGULAR VISION -- the camera light BOUNCES as Hud
races at a dead sprint down the tunnels He’s pushing the
group forward -- they’re all running as fast as they can --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 79

HUD (0S)
GO GO GO --
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK -- it’s all around us now --
UP AHEAD Lily glances back over her shoulder -- her EYES GO

WIDE -- she SCREAMS as --

A parasite LAUNCHES ITSELF AT HER -- WHAM -- it hits her on
the shoulder knocking her to the ground --

HUD (0S)
LILY --

The camera SHAKES as Hud races towards Lily -- we get a
better look at THE PARASITE -- it’s roughly the size of a
large dog with multiple flailing legs and a mouth full of
razor teeth -- Lily SCREAMS in horror as it lunges at her --

Rob dives into frame tries to rip the parasite off Lily --
Hud stumbles swings the camera around the light catches --

MORE PARASITES Coming right at Hud WHAM The lead
parasite rears up on its haunches knocks Hud to the ground

The camera lands next to him pointed back down the tunnel
towards the others We see Rob fighting with the parasite on
Lily -- Marlena dives towards the ground lunging for
something (we don’t see what) --

As Hud SCREAMS the camera is suddenly YANKED BACKWARDS as
though the parasite’s dragging Hud down the tunnel AWAY FROM
THE OTHERS (the strap around his neck keeps the camera tied
to Hud)

HUD (0S)
HELP ME

We hear the PARASITE THRASHING -- Hud CRIES OUT -- but we
can’t see exactly what’s happening to him as HE’S DRAGGED
AWAY We’re on the ground looking DOWN THE TUNNEL as Lily
and the others grow smaller and smaller in frame --

VOICE
HUD --

One of the others breaks away from the fight races towards
camera As she approaches we realize --

It’s Marlena

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 80

And we realize what she was diving for earlier -- in her
hand she holds a length of METAL PIPE She charges towards
us swings the pipe with all her might at the parasite on top
of us -- WHACK -- we hear the parasite SQUEAL IN PAIN --

Hud struggles to roll over -- as he does so -- the parasite
strikes back charging Marlena knocking her to the ground
As Marlena struggles with the parasite on the ground next to
Hud -- SQUEEEE -- the parasite opens its mouth and SINKS ITS
TEETH into Marlena’s shoulder --

Marlena SCREAMS IN PAIN as BLOOD SPURTS from her shoulder
SPLATTERING THE CAMERA LENS --

Hud rolls to his feet -- we see his legs has he KICKS THE
PARASITE as hard as he can -- it squeals in pain --

Hud drags Marlena to her feet then rights the camera -- uses
it like a flashlight so that they can see --

MARLENA
Lets qo --

The two of them race forward The camera shakes as they run
as fast as they can the parasites swarming around them --

UP AHEAD -- Rob’s KICKING A PARASITE mercilessly -- a crazed
fury in his eyes as he literally CURB STOMPS the thing to
death

Lily rolls to her feet looking behind us in horror as we
hear MORE CLICKING SOUNDS coming up behind us She pulls Rob
off the parasite points us towards --

LILY
Door -- GET TO THE DOOR --
Hud angles the camera -- sees Lily’s leading them towards --

A MAINTENANCE DOOR Rob gets there first yanks it open --
as we race towards it -- the parasites are SWARMING
EVERYWHERE --

ROB
CMON -- C’MON --

Marlena bolts through the door Hud’s right behind her -- A
parasite LAUNCHES ITSELF at them -- WHAM -- HITS THE WALL
right beside the door just as Hud races through --

CAMERA SHAKES as they race through the dark corridor -- UP
AHEAD we see an OPEN DOORWAY -- as we race towards it we see

Lily on the other side of the door waving us ahead --

Rob shoves Hud through the doorway -- Hud pitches forward
into the room --

We catch a glimpse of Marlena on the ground WHAM We hear
Lily shut the door shut behind them -- Hud falls forward and

as the camera slams down into the ground --

checking it over making sure the thing still works

He shakes his head in disbelief Then he takes his sleeve
and CLEANS THE BLOOD off the lens As he works we CUT --

ON MARLENA -- we’re looking at the BITE WOUND on her back
shoulder Blood seeps from the multiple punctures --

MARLENA
How does it look

HUD (0S)
(after a beat)
It looks like it hurts

Marlena grits her teeth nods -- that sounds about right

see Rob kicking in the glass of a VENDING MACHINE --

Moments later Marlena’s pouring BOTTLED WATER on a scrap of
fabric that looks like its been torn from Hud’s shirt She

looks ASHEN --

HUD (0S)
-- those things came out of nowhere --

Marlena presses the fabric to her wound Winces

MARLENA
Yeah
HUD (0S)
When it took me down it was like

it was trying to drag me away
She glances at him Smiles despite herself --

MARLENA
Maybe it liked you Hud

A beat We can almost hear Hud smile behind the camera

HUD (0S)
Yeah Maybe it was trying to make
me its Queen

Marlena smiles at that Then winces again Fuck this
hurts

HUD (0S)
Thanks by the way For coming back
to help me

And Marlena glances at him We get the sense she’s actually
hurt by that when she says --

MARLENA
You think I’m the sort of person who
wouldnt

HUD (0S)
No No of course not

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 83

And as Hud HOLDS ON HER we realize we may have misjudged
this woman But Hud never did --

I’m just saying I’m glad you did
what you did

Marlena looks at him eyes softening She nods It’s an
intimate moment Hud just HOLDS ON HER

Later The four of them huddle around one another As they

tend to their various scratches and scrapes --

ROB
-- we could lay low here for a bit
hope those things don’t find their
way in

The others glance at each other shake their heads

MARLENA
Yeah Next option

ROB
We could keep moving try to finda
different tunnel

LILY
No more tunnels

ROB
Then we take our chances up top

The four of them sit in silence thinking it over --

HUD (0S)
So just to be clear -- our choices
are “die here” “die in the tunnels”

or “die on the streets”

INT CORRIDORSPLATFORM - NIGHT 120

ON THE MOVE At the end of the corridor we see faint LIGHT
peeking through a set of doors Rob leads the way steps
through the doors Marlena and Lily follow with Hud
bringing up the rear --

Hud steps through the doors and finds the others looking
slightly dumbfounded as they glance around at their
surroundings Hud angles the camera around to reveal --

MANNEQUINS dressed in designer clothes They’re eerily
silhouetted -- backlit by the KLEIG LIGHTING that streams in
through floor to ceiling windows across the vast space which
is filled with racks and racks of clothing

LILY
I recognize this
(beat)
This is Bloomingdales

Yep they’re in a DEPARTMENT STORE The mazes of subway
corridors led them right into the middle of Bloomingdales --

INT DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT 121
The group cautiously makes its way through the store

As HUD PULLS BACK widening out we see signs of the chaos
that must have hit here several hours ago -- overturned
racks shopping bags abandoned on the ground cash registers
knocked off the counters

It’s creepy to say the least The entire store is empty
Not a person to be seen As Hud follows Rob and Lily he
realizes Marlena is no longer in frame --

Hud turns -- there she is But she’s just standing there A
glazed pale expression on her face as she stares off --

HUD (OS)
Marlena

Marlena looks at the camera seems to focus --

HUD (0S)
You okay

MARLENA
Yeah -- I’m just a bit dizzy --
(then clear-headed)
I‘m fine

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 85

As she says that the shadows behind her seem to MOVE --

MARLENA
I‘m fine Let’s go

As she turns THREE BEAMS OF LIGHT rake out of the darkness --

VOICE
Weve got civilians

The voice jolts Hud He swings the camera up as THREE ARMED
SOLDIERS charge towards them -- the XENON BEAMS on their
weapons sweep the frame -- then settle on the faces of our
group as they all stop in their tracks put up their hands --
Jesus what the hell’s going on here

The LEAD SOLDIER steps forward (and though we’ll never say
his name let’s call him SERGEANT MAJOR PRYCE)

PRYCE

Are there any more of you
ROB

No it’s just us

Pryce barks into his comm --

Ive got four civilians here
CUT TO
INT DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT 122

ON THE MOVE The soldiers lead our group through
Bloomingdales Our group’s still stunned -- not sure what’s
happening here We cut into their conversation --

ROB
(urgent)
Listen -- we need help Our friend --
shes hurt -- she’s trapped in her
building -- it’s just a few blocks
from here -- 53rd and Park --

PRYCE
(shakes head)
Yeah that’s not where you want to be
right now

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 86

LILY
Do you guys know what it is Out
there -- do you what that thing is

And as Pryce leads them forward he almost laughs his voice
sounds HAUNTED as he says --

PRYCE
If they know they ain’t telling me
(beat)
But whatever it is it’s winning

As they approach the front of the store they notice more
soldiers A lot more In fact --

An entire infantry battalion has set up an emergency field
operations station in the store Field generators powering

LIGHTS and EQUIPMENT It’s almost surreal And as Hud
angles around we realize that they’ve just passed into a

makeshift TRIAGE CENTER MEDICS tend to injured soldiers
And one thing is instantly clear --

The soldiers have had the shit kicked out of them

MEDIC -- hey no -- this one needs to be in
quarantine --

Hud slows down angles the camera toward the VOICE to see a
MEDIC step away from two soldiers wheeling a STRETCHER As
the Medic redirects the soldiers Hud gets just a GLIMPSE of

the stretcher -- and what lies atop it --
Whatever we’re looking at it’s gruesome -- bloody meat with
one leg and a head attached Dear God its a person
Looking almost as if they exploded We HEAR Hud’s breath
catch in his throat --
HUD (0S)

Oh don’t look at that
Hud swings the camera back -- hustles to catch up --
INT DEPARTMENT STORE - COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT 123

Hud’s following the soldiers into the battalion’s
COMMUNICATION CENTER a makeshift hub of radio equipment and
computers Rob’s still pleading with Pryce a growing sense
of URGENCY in his voice --

ROB
Please -- we can’t stay here --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 87

As they approach the comm center Pryce holds up a hand to
Rob -- be quiet Hud angles forward as an OFFICER finishes
briefing his COMMANDING OFFICER (let’s call him LIEUTENANT
COLONEL GRAFF) --

OFFICER
we got two F-18s coming out of
Sulfridge four more arming up maybe
thirty minutes out

Graff nods -- good -- he turns towards the room --

GRAFF
Listen up people Rack it and pack
it I want us phantoms in fifteen --

As the soldiers start hastily packing up their equipment
Graff glances up at Rob and the others --

GRAFF
The hell did you find them

PRYCE
They were in the tunnels sir

Graff studies our group then calls out --

GRAFF
Medical

ACROSS THE STORE -- we see TWO MEDICS hurry towards them
Graff turns to Pryce issuing orders as he moves --

GRAFF
Look ‘em over get them ready for
transport We’ll put them on the
evac choppers

PRYCE
Yes sir
ROB
No -- wait --
Graff stops in his tracks -- Im sorry what But Rob
doesn’t care He’s amped up INTENSE --
ROB
Our friend -- she’s in trouble -- we

have to get to her --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 88

GRAFF
I can’t help you Son
(to Pryce)
Get ‘em on the choppers

Pryce puts his hand on Rob’s shoulder tries to move him out
of Graffs way

PRYCE
C’mon --

But Rob knocks Pryce’s hand aside --

ROB
Don’t touch me --
WHOA -- the soldiers tense -- you don’t talk back to these
guys Pryce bristles shoving Rob back And as he does so
Graff looks towards Hud -- pushes the camera aside --
GRAFF
Turn that goddamn camera off --
CUT TO
INT DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT 124
Moments later FROM A LOW ANGLE -- we’re looking across the

store as two men in HAZ-MAT SUITS approach us From the
cameras angle we get the sense that Hud is surreptitiously
holding the camera down by his side We can hear Rob still
arguing with Graff Graff sounds fucking angry --

GRAFF (0S)
-- in the last half hour alone I’ve
lost three companies of men --

As the HAZ-MAT SUITS pass by us we see that they’re carrying
something between them --

It’s a PARASITE But thankfully it’s dead Dripping thick
yellow “blood” which smears the HAZ-MAT SUITS

GRAFF (0S) ROB (0S)
-- there’s nothing we can -- I’m not asking for your
do -- help --

Hud angles the camera to follow the men as they cross toward
QUARANTINE an area cordoned off with a TRANSLUCENT PLASTIC
CURTAIN -- like a portable operating theatre As the men
carry the parasite through the plastic curtain --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 89

ROB (0S)
-- I just need you to get out of my
way --

Hud (discreetly) angles the camera back We catch a glimpse
of LILY -- she’s tense uneasy as she watches Rob argue with
Graff The MEDICS quickly check over her wounds --

GRAFF (0S)
-- I’m not letting you get yourself
killed Do you have any idea what’s
out there

As Hud pans towards Rob we pass MARLENA -- she’s looking
PALE WOOZY Hud lingers on her for a second then --

ROB (0S)
Idon’t care what’s out there
Listen to me --

Hud angles the camera towards Rob -- and Rob’s absolutely
REDLINING desperate to get out of there --

ROB
She’s dying

This girl The girl that I love

more than anything else in this world
is DYING And it’s my fault She
should have been with me tonight and
I let her go

MARLENA (0S)

Hud angles the camera back towards Marlena --

MARLENA (0OS)
Hud I don’t feel so good

And we hear Hud’s breath catch in his throat as he realizes --
Blood is dripping from her eyes

HUD (0S)
Marlena --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 90

Everyone looks towards them As soon as the medics see
Marlena they go to DEFCON ONE --

MEDIC
Bite -- WE GOT A BITE

And ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE Marlena starts COUGHING
VIOLENTLY blood starts pouring out her nose as well

The two guys in Haz-Mat suits come CHARGING out of the
quarantine area at top speed racing towards Marlena The
medics looks at Hud panic in their voices --

MEDIC SECOND MEDIC
Were you bit Wasanyone else bit

The guys in Haz-Mat suits reach Marlena grab her by the
shoulders Start forcibly dragging her back towards the
quarantine area She looks back at Hud TERROR in her eyes --

MARLENA

And he’s moving towards her trying to follow --

GRAFF (0S)
Stop him --
It’s CHAOS SOLDIERS GRAB HUD -- as the camera jostles we

catch a glimpse of Rob and Lily also being restrained
Medics are searching all of them frantic --

MEDIC LILY
Were you bit No -- it’s just her --

And right then we hear Marlena START TO SCREAM Camera
swings back towards her -- just in time to see her body start
CONVULSING -- as the HAZ-MAT guys race her into the
quarantine area she SCREAMS and SCREAMS --

And just as they usher her through the translucent plastic --

Marlena seems to ERUPT with BLOOD SPLASH -- the plastic is
SPLATTERED with massive amounts of BLOOD

Hud’s fighting with the soldiers trying to get to her --

HUD
MARLENA --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 91

GET ‘EM OUT OF HERE --

And as the camera shakes we catch a glimpse of soldiers
pulling Rob and Lily away And as they yank Hud backwards --

We catch a final glimpse of THAT PLASTIC Covered in blood
As Marlena’s screams continue to RING OUT --

and Hud towards the back of the store Pryce is in the lead
seems to be arguing with ANOTHER SOLDIER We upcut right
into their conversation --

PRYCE
(giving orders)
-- go and help with the evacuation
Igot ‘em from here --

In the background we can still hear Marlena SCREAMING --

SOLDIER
You sure

And Pryce looks at our group Rob and Lily look sufficiently
terrified right now Pryce LOCKS EYES WITH ROB as he says --

PRYCE
Yeah They ain’t gonna be any
trouble
(to soldiers)
Go

And as the other soldiers break away we HEAR Marlena’s
screams abruptly STOP Hud swings the camera back towards
Pryce We hear the panic in Hud’s voice --

HUD (0S)
Why’d she stop

A long beat Then he asks again knowing the answer --

HUD (0S)
Why’d she stop screaming

And we HOLD on PRYCE as he stares at us
CUT TO

INT DEPARTMENT STORE AND STORE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 126

Moments later Pryce is ushering them down a CORRIDOR
Robs making a final desperate plea We UPCUT into it --

ROB

Shut up and listen
Rob stops in his tracks Pryce levels his gaze at him --

PRYCE

53rd and Park

ROB
(nods)
Yeah

PRYCE

Those blocks got hit hard You may
get there and find there’s nothing

You want to go out in this I ain’t
gonna stop you The Governments
initiated the Icarus Protocol Which

means they’re willing to let this

area go
ROB

You mean Midtown
PRYCE

I mean Manhattan

(off their looks)
They’re gonna take one last shot at

at his watch confused)

and Third The last chopper’s wheels
up at exactly oh-six hundred

If you can make it there well get

HUD (0S)
They were dragging her away

Lily glances over her shoulder Sees Hud Stops with him --

Rob stops as well Compassion in his eyes as he glances back
at his friend As Lily moves towards Hud --

CUT TO
EXT MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 128

ON THE MOVE AGAIN Rob’s in the lead Our people are
silent Focused As we round a corner --

Clop clop clop clop -- A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE emerges from
the dark debris in front of us As the horse races past

camera we notice the carriage is empty It’s EERIE

CUT TO
EXT MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 129
As Hud keeps moving -- UP AHEAD -- his camera FINDS ROB

Robs standing in the middle of the intersection staring
forward (we can’t see at what) He looks like he’s in shock

HUD (0S)
Rob Rob what’s the matter
Lily’s ahead of Hud -- she reaches Rob looks down the
street and stops right in her tracks
HUD (0S)
Guys -- what is it

-- and we catch up to Rob and Lily and come around behind
them And now we see it too A forty-story tall building
half a block down has been KNOCKED OFF ITS FOUNDATION -- AND
IS LEANING NOW ACROSS PARK AVENUE ONTO THE SKYSCRAPER ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AVENUE

A130

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 95

HUD (0S)
That’s -- that’s not her place
right Tell me that’s not Beth’s

apartment

And we come around onto Rob whose wide eyes stare at the
structure in true horror -- he wants to run in there
somehow but is paralyzed

HUD (0S)
Rob

ROB
(utter shock)
Yeah That’s her place

CUT TO
EXT PARK AVENUE - NIGHT A130
Were closer to Beth’s building Circling the foundation

The debris is HEAVY -- the wreckage litters the area making
it difficult to get close --

HUD (0S)
I don’t suppose she’s on the ground
floor

ROB

(shakes head)
Thirty-ninth

LILY
How do we even get inside

ROB
Well try to climb it

Lily stares at the mound of WRECKAGE blocking the building’s
entrance Sees the snakes of TWISTED METAL and CONCRETE In
the understatement of the year --

LILY
(quietly)
I don’t know if I can climb that

Hud surveys the scene The camera follows the canted
building up towards the roof where it LEANS AGAINST THE
OTHER BUILDING And we can almost hear the lightbulb go off
in Hud’s head

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 96

HUD Uh guys
(beat)
We could go across We climb up that
building 5303 Then find a place
to transfer over on the roof

He points upward They look up see what he’s talking about
They glance at each other Huh That might work Hud

realizes they might actually be considering his idea --

HUD (0S)
You know what Never mind Bad
idea Bad idea

CUT TO

EXTINT 5303 PARK AVENUE - NIGHT 130

Were looking up at the “5303” NUMBERS -- then we TILT UP to
see that we are RIGHT BELOW THE CANTED APARTMENT BUILDING --
looking UP at where it’s leaning against the other structure

HUD (0S8)
(muttering)
Nobody listens to me Ever Now you
listen to me

ROB
Hud move come on

And now we’re MOVING IN to the lobby following Rob and
Lily -- shattered GLASS and debris EVERYWHERE --

CUT TO

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT 131
We’re walking briskly up the stairwell Cracks and random
drywall debris Everyone’s out of breath --

HUD (0S)

Did you see the look on his face when
Lily asked him about it They really
don’t know what that thing is

(beat realizing)
Or they’re in on it Oh my god --
has the military been doing any
nuclear testing off the coast of New
York lately

Rob shoots Hud a look The fuck are you talking about Hud

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 97

HUD (0S)
I don’t read the papers Maybe we
made that thing

ROB
Sure Maybe we did So what Does
it really matter right now

HUD (0S)
Yes It matters It matters because
I have to talk about something or I’m
gonna shit myself right here in this

stairwell

ROB
Okay but -- we have to talk about
that

HUD (0S)

No no we can talk about something
else Anything else Oh hey here’s
a topic for debate -- did you guys
notice that we’re about to transfer
over into the CROOKED BUILDING OF
DEATH

And Hud yells so loud it stops Rob and Lily in their tracks
They glance at each other -- Oh shit Is Hud finally losing
it There’s a beat of awkward silence then --

LILY
Maybe the monster’s been frozen up
in the polar ice caps all this

time
Rob looks at her nods Plays along genuine --
ROB

Yeah And maybe global warming
finally freed it

HUD (0S)
(recovering)
Oh that’s good I didn’t even think

INTEXT 5303 PARK AVENUE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 133

Hud’s lagging behind He reaches the top of the staircase
heads down a hall catching up with Rob and Lily

They’re at the end of the hallway cautiously glancing out
the SHATTERED WINDOWS where Beth’s building can be seen
RIGHT OUTSIDE leaning towards us against our building

ROB
Oh god

And Hud aims his camera OUT THE SMASHED WINDOW -- we can
plainly see the ROOF of Beth’s apartment angled

horrifically shattered at impact and extending out into the
sky They could climb down from these windows onto the

roof and climb UP the roof Which is exactly what happens --

ROB
Okay I’11 go first
HUD (0S)
I’ll document it
LILY

Careful --

And Rob climbs out of the window terrified but determined
We watch as he lands on the debris on the roof he turns
back helps Lily down --

Just then a ROAR -- no not the monster -- we PAN to the sky
where SIX F-18’s fly in LOW FORMATION CRACKING THE HEAVENS
as they disappear overhead --

Rob and Lily wince then look back toward Hud --

ROB
Hud -- c’mon -- put the camera down --

stepping over shattered plaster -- WHUMP -- and rounds the

corner to find --

Rob At the far end of the hallway Charging forward --
WHUMP -- SLAMMING HIS SHOULDER into an apartment door And
we realize that’s what that sound is -- Rob’s been trying to
break down Beth’s door

As Hud KEEPS MOVING TOWARDS HIM -- Rob sets his jaw --
INTENSE and DETERMINED as he charges the door once again --
CR-CRACK -- The door splinters Rob charges inside Hud and
Lily are RIGHT BEHIND HIM --

piled against the “low end” of the apartment

And our CAMERA SWEEPS THE ROOM -- and WE SEE amid the

shirt -- unconscious -- Blood all around the area -- Lily
gasps -- Rob stares --

in frame Hud angles towards the REBAR -- we can see it

clearly protruding from her shoulder her blood glistening on
the metal pooling beneath her --

And we’re CLOSE ON ROB as he stares at her sees she’s not
moving It’s as though his worst fears have been realized --
oh god she dead His face goes WHITE tears WELL UP in his
eyes --

ROB
Beth -- oh god -- BETH --

And as he cups her face with his hand she GROANS Her eyes
flutter open She struggles to focus as though waking from
a dream After a beat her eyes fix on Rob her voice comes
out as barely a WHISPER --

BETH
Hey
And were ON ROB as relief washes over him She’s alive He
can’t help himself -- TEARS start to spill over now
ROB

And now Beth starts to WELL UP Tears spilling as she smiles
and says --

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 101 BETH
You came back for me

ROB
Of course I came back for you
(beat then)
I’m sorry it took me so long

And it’s a real moment As Rob says that we get the sense
he’s apologizing for everything he’s put her through And
Beth reads it loud and clear --

BETH
(through tears)
It’s okay
(beat)
I’m glad you made it

And as she says that she shifts and the pain in her
shoulder suddenly hits her She GASPS cries out

Rob snaps out of it -- goes into emergency mode He stares
down at her ROCK SOLID as he tells her --

ROB
Were gonna get you outta here all
right
(forming a plan)
You’re gonna be okay

6807 CLOVERFIELD by Drew Goddard 102

Hud does as he’s told He sets the camera onto the floor --
AND THE CAMERA SLIDES DOWN FOUR FEET OR SO COMING TO A STOP
ATAN ANGLE THAT STILL LETS US SEE THE ACTION -- BUT WITH A
PIECE OF DEBRIS COVERING BETH

We can still see her legs (and Rob Lily and now HUD) but
the part of her caught in the rebar is OFF-CAMERA Good
thing too because what they do next is BRUTAL They grab
Beth by the shoulders and legs --

ROB (CONTD)
-- this is gonna suck I’m sorry
(looks to the others)
Okay -- lift --

-- and the three of them LIFT BETH UP OVER THE REBAR -- she
SCREAMS and SCREAMS in AGONY -- it’s EXCRUCIATING -- but this
is the only way -- and finally she’s UP and OFF THE REBAR --

Rob cradles her sets her down As she GASPS tries to keep
from passing out Rob grabs a strewn tablecloth -- RRRIP --
tears off a strip and begins wrapping her wound --

Hud grabs the camera -- swings it towards Rob and Beth -- as
Rob pulls the bandage tight Beth winces in pain but keeps
her eyes locked on Rob It’s as though she truly can’t
believe what she’s seeing Fresh tears well up but this
time it’s RELIEF in her eyes --

BETH
You came back for me

ROB
(holding her gaze)
Of course I did

And it would be a nice moment if not for --

stop the bleeding --

Hud pulls the camera off DROPS IT TO THE GROUND It lands
several feet away framing our characters

off their knees As they struggle to right themselves --

BETH
Hud --

BOOM BOOM The SOUNDS OF CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION build and
build -- just as the noise around them becomes DEAFENING
Hud pulls the tourniquet tight once again --

HUD
It’s stopped -- it’s stopped --

BETH
All right let’s go -- help me --

Beth and Hud pull Rob to his feet Rob cries out in pain
grits his teeth fights through it As Beth tries to help
Rob forward --

BETH
We gotta move

Hud realizes he forgot something --

HUD
Hang on --

He turns races towards the camera He picks it up loops it
around his neck Angles back towards Beth and Rob And as
he does so --

BOOM The worlds goes DARK AROUND THEM -- We see Beth and
Rob’s eyes go wide in TERROR --

ROB
HUD

Beth SCREAMS Whip-fast Hud swings around looks up towards
the sky just in time to see --

THE MONSTER
It’s moving fast -- BARRELLING DOWN RIGHT TOWARDS HUD -- we

catch a glimpse of its SNAPPING JAWS as it BITES DOWN -- Hud
barely has time to SCREAM as --

THE MONSTER EATS HUD

WH-WHAM Camera’s LOOKING DOWN HUD’S BODY as Hud’s caught in
the creases of the monster’s ENORMOUS TEETH -- and as Hud
SCREAMS AND SCREAMS --

Hud’s BODY is RIPPED APART Its SO FAST it’s hard to
register exactly what we’re seeing -- light FLASHES IN AND
OUT of the monster’s mouth as it gnashes its TEETH -- ONCE --
TWICE -- BLOOD FLIES EVERYWHERE -- Hud’s screaming ABRUPTLY
CEASES as --

The monster swings its mouth down -- we see the fragments of
Hud’s body drop free -- the CAMERA SLIPS LOOSE -- and FALLS --

Were in the air -- all we see is BLUE SKY -- as the camera
tumbles -- we catch a GLIMPSE OF THE MONSTER racing forwards
snapping angrily -- the camera slowly flips around -- we see
the GREEN GRASS OF CENTRAL PARK rushing up to meet us

WHAM The camera HITS THE GROUND digging into the deep
green grass And a split-second after that --

WHAM HUD’S FACE hits the ground right next to the lens
He’s staring at us eyes dead to the world face streaked
with blood We’re SO CLOSE the camera’s AUTO-FOCUS can’t
quite adjust -- as Hud’s eyes BLUR IN AND OUT OF FOCUS --

VOICE
Hud -- HUD --

We hear A VOICE SCREAMING in HORROR Growing closer --

VOICE
HUD HUD

The voice is so PRIMAL and TORTURED it takes us a moment to
realize -- It’s ROB Screaming his heart out for his friend
It sounds like he’s racing towards us --

ROB (0S)
HUD

The camera jostles -- it’s as though Rob just reached the
body -- and off that action WE CUT TO --

EXT CENTRAL PARK - BRIDGE - MORNING 157

We’re racing through Central Park headed towards a bridge
As we do so -- PZZT -- the camera fritzes again and we --

CUT TO
EXT CENTRAL PARK - UNDER BRIDGE - MORNING 158

Moments later We’re diving beneath the bridge CRASHING TO
THE GROUND It’s as though whoever was carrying the camera
just dropped it as they stumbled forward --

OUTSIDE -- we can still hear the RUMBLINGS from the WAR going
on between the monster and the army

FROM THE GROUND -- we catch a glimpse of Rob He’s on the
ground GASPING for air We can hear Beth GASPING as well
They both sound pained anguished We get the sense they’ve
collapsed from pure exhaustion As they both GASP and GASP
and GASP for air -- PZ2T --

CUT TO
EXT CENTRAL PARK - UNDER BRIDGE - MORNING 159

Moments later Camera’s still on the ground where it fell
Rob’s shifted just slightly -- we still can’t see his face

but we can see the FRESH BLOOD all over his hands -- we hear
his PAINED CRIES -- his voice is whispered through gasps --
ROB (0S)

it up of the ground and is trying to work it As it swings
around we catch a glimpse of his lower body -- he’s still

lying on the ground with his back against the wall We can
see the FRESH BLOOD all over him --

We can hear THEIR VOICES They sound a little less panicked
More RESIGNED --

BETH (0S)

Camera adjusts to FIND ROB He’s looking right at us He
looks BATTERED HAUNTED SHELLSHOCKED

out -- the noise has become commonplace

Rob stares at us Prepares to speak We get the sense he’s
fighting off tears And LOSING
