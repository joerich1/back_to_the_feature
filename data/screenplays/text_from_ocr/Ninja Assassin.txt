REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408

FADE IN

CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into
flesh The ink is needled into the surface of the skin
raw and bloody the needled brush tapped with the
precision of ritual

The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print Miyamoto
Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon

The image has beauty but retains the violence required to
saturate flesh with art

The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle-
work

HOLLYWOOD
Fuck Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-
fuck

PULL BACK to reveal that were in

INT TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT

A place of designer furniture beautiful girls carrying
towels tea and cigarettes Dozens of Yakuza look on as
the process continues sleeves rolled up or shirts off to

expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos

HOLLYWOOD the young Yakuza member is getting his first
tattoo a relatively small one on his back

He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby

HOLLYWOOD

Watch it old man

The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush Maybe
a little harder

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
What the fuck Youre doing it
wrong

TATTOO ARTIST
The needle is doing what the
needle does

HOLLYWOOD
Whats that supposed to mean

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408

TATTOO MASTER
The irezumi does not hide the
skin the tattoo reveals the
nature of the man and illuminates
the four noble professions in the
Book of Five Rings the Warrior
the Artist the Merchant and the
farmer If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin
between the mark and the man then
perhaps the path you have chosen
is not the path for which you are
suited

HOLLYWOOD
What did you just say old man

Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old
mans jaw

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
I know you didnt just disrespect
me did you You that fucking
stupid You disrespect me and
Ill tattoo this ceiling with your
fucking brains

The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through
years of service to men like Hollywood

TATTOO MASTER
No disrespect

Hollywood smiles

HOLLYWOOD
Youre lucky I cant kill you
til you finish this thing Gimme
that mirror Hows it looking

Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus

Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror He
whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an

origami envelope

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Not bad Not bad For an old fuck

YAKUZA ONE
Hey boss This just came for you

HOLLYWOOD
What is it

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 3 1
YAKUZA ONE
A letter
HOLLYWOOD

So open it dumb ass

He opens the origami envelope then hesitates at what he
sees

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
What What is it

He pours the contents out into his hand

YAKUZA ONE
Looks like sand

He tastes it

YAKUZA ONE (CONTD)
Yup Sand Black Sand
The tattoo master drops his brush It clatters to the
floor

TATTOO MASTER
No

HOLLYWOOD
You know what this is

The artist barely nods

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Wanna let us in on the joke

TATTOO MASTER
Years ago I watched a man open an
envelope like that one

His eyes pool with fury at the memory

TATTOO MASTER (CONTD)
There were many with him and they
laughed like you laugh now Then
it came from the shadows and their
laughter was drowned in blood
You cannot bargain with what is
coming You cannot reason with it
Because it is not a human being
It is a demon sent straight from
hell that will never stop until
you are dead

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 4 1

HOLLYWOOD
What came out of the shadows

TATTOO MASTER
I cannot say the word

HOLLYWOOD
What word

He pulls open his robe revealing a hauntingly beautiful
tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump

of scar tissue at the center of his heart

TATTOO ARTIST
That night one of their blades
struck here I should have died
but for an accident of birth My
heart is here on the other side

Hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon

HOLLYWOOD
What the fuck is that

YAKUZA ONE
Looks like a Ninja boss

HOLLYWOOD
A ninja Are you kidding me
Thats the word youre afraid to
say Ninja

As he starts to laugh

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Ninja-Ninja-Ninja

His laughter is infectious

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
You old fuck You had me going
Ninja Thats some good shit

His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his
head disappears sliced off from his jaw up leaving his
tongue wagging in space

Lights shatter around the room

Chaos ensues The panicked screams of the fleeing
entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles
of Hollywoods foot soldiers as one by one they are
eviscerated

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 5 1

Theres a RUSH of movement more felt than seen The
whistle of swords through the air Cries and screams
Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled

STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master barely visible in
the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window
Frozen Immobile As the killing continues around him
Then silence broken by the sound of heavy desperate
BREATHING and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who
looks up --

-- and sees a dark figures standing before him Everyone
else is dead Only he and the Tattoo Master remain The
figure regards him with still silence For perhaps the
first time in his life Hollywood is terrified

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Listen you dont have to do
this Whatever youre getting
paid Ill triple it You hear me
Ill pay you whatever you want
Just name your price

Their answer is silence Hollywood sees his guns nearby
With a desperate scream he THROWS the match in the air

as he DIVES for his guns grabbing one in each hand

There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed
hands are tumbling gracefully through the air

The blade swings again slicing through his body as if it
were barely there coming out the other side as --

-- Hollywoods body erupts as it falls in two pieces
splattering the artist with blood

The match touches the floor and goes out

The Tattoo Master does not move has not moved Frozen

TATTOO ARTIST
But you are real arent you

After a moment the ninja emerges into the moonlight the
way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the
dark to inspect its kill

The artist doesnt move but his eyes widen his heart
pounding in his ears

TATTOO ARTIST (CONTD)
For fifty-seven-years Ive told
your story

TATTOO ARTIST (CONTD)
No one ever believed
me

The ninja walks towards him his steps soundless He
crouches down his eyes taking in the old mans tattoo

TATTOO ARTIST (CONTD)
But you are real arent you

Theres the shing of a sword being unsheathed The
artist closes his eyes anticipating death

Silence He waits for the death blow It does not come
He finally forces himself to open his eyes

The ninja is gone having departed as silently as he
came leaving death and blood in his wake

place is monastic nothing decorative or comfortable

Then in a quick series of cuts he checks all of the
secret places he hides things

A drawer is flipped over and a hidden bottom opens
revealing weapons A panel in the oven reveals his chain
and blade A hidden compartment in his suitcase exposes
inky folds of fabric He sifts through them as we hear-

he has just defeated in a fight Both are sweaty dirty

childs eyes haunted by an adults sorrows and knowledge

Korean queen late eighteen-

hundreds According to you she
was offd by one of these ninja
clans

MIKA

Ozunu I think Ive been going
through some of the original
transcripts of the trial of
Kunitomo Shigeaki The prosecutor
questioned him about a payment of
100 pounds of gold Shigeaki
answered that he didnt know what
the prosecutor was talking about
The question was never brought up
again But what pinged for me was
the amount- the exact same amount
rumored to be paid to the Hattori
Clan for the assassination of Lord
Sanda

MASLOW
So you start to wonder in this
ever changing world if the cost
of a mans life has remained
constant

MIKA
Exactly I figure these clans are
like a thousand years old They
probably dont change a lot

She begins flipping through huge reams of bank records

MIKA (CONTD)
I started looking at international
wire transfers targeting banks in
the regions of several high-
profile assassinations and bingo-
The proverbial needle in a haystack a single wire
transfer circled in red

MIKA (CONTD)
Minister Zhang The day before
the assassination 155599990
was transferred from the bank of
Shanghai The exact market value
of one hundred pounds of gold

MASLOW
Highly circumstantial

I thought you might say that so I
checked how often this particular
bank transferred that market
equivalent to a hundred pounds of
gold in the last three years

MASLOW
Let me guess

MIKA
Not once

He sifts through the report

MASLOW
Okay you got me This is
interesting

The clans are real Ryan They
steal children and turn them into
assassins Theyve been doing it
for years and nobodys doing a

damn thing to stop them

laid down in an intricate pattern They are not

This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor

weakness exists

takes his first step Carefully Graceful as any
dancer

He makes no sound

OZUNU (CONTD)
You must hate all weakness Hate

it in others but most of hate it

in yourself
He takes another step and another Each soft as a
falling feather
He is a third of the way across the floor - his body
gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor
sings beneath him
Raizo stops a flash of panic in his eyes Then he

subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending
foot holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches

blows that leave deep cuts

which a thick salve has been folded She crosses the few
feet to Raizos mat and as he watches in silent agony
she puts her finger to her lips then kneels down --

moments we can see the pain leaving his eyes Finishing
quickly she folds the remaining salve back into the
leaf exchanges a quick furtive glance with Raizo then
heads back for her mat

He lays there for a BEAT confused as to whether his
diminishing pain is a good thing Then he turns to look
at Kiriko but she lays with her back to him apparently

begins to play revealing a time coded security camera
recording an urban street corner in Japan The tape is
riddled with digital noise and artifacting

Then slowly the digital noise seems to coalesce to
grow shapes The shadows come to life

Then with incredible speed two dark figures start
battling it out their blades striking sparks that are
still descending after theyve slipped back into the
shadows

They emerge over and over brief flashes of clarity like
the perfect arc of a calligraphers brush describing the
wing of a bird Fight Retreat Silence Shadows

CLOSE on a bed of nails sixteen penny nails arranged in
perfect rows pointing up the sharp tips catching the
light

As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep
but this is really the first time we have heard him sound
like he is straining

As we continue to WIDEN we discover the reason for this
he is doing handstand push-ups On the nails Over and
over with little apparent effort

The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light
like the tips of the nails as we HEAR

INT MIKAS OFFICE - NIGHT 24
Mika is at her computer doing what she does best
intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of
information

Searching through what is known about Ibu-Battuta she
discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the
Rihla supposedly destroyed sometime in the 15th
century

She remains immersed until a sound grows louder and
louder

A vacuum cleaner She checks the time Very late She
looks up and finds two eyes watching her through the
crack in her open door

Startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear

In the hallway an older Asian man is pushing the vacuum
cleaner

Raizo is practicing his chain form

We begin to hear the sounds of another fight
GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 26

FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DOJO - NIGHT 27

Raizo is fighting with TAKESHI a few years older ina
room lit by hundreds of hanging torches Armed with
atanas the boys duck dodge and weave around the
burning obstacles as they fight

They are both extremely agile their bodies moving with
the impossible flexibility of youth

Kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan
f she feels anything as she watches the fight we cannot
tell

They perform a vicious series of combinations then
Takeshis sword cracks against Raizos head opening a
huge gash

fq

Raizo hits the ground hard blood speckling the mats

Takeshi backs away as Ozunu steps in
As blood flows down the side of his face Raizo looks
like the young boy that he is Pain throbs from the
wound and he begins to cry

OZUNU
Did Takeshis blow hurt you You
think this is pain You are

mistaken

He gouges three fingers into the boys stomach and twists
something inside of him

Raizo screams
His screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing
OZUNU (CONTD)
That is true pain You must learn

to live with it

He steps back leaving Raizo writhing in agony

leave

TIME CUT
Later Night

Raizo is still where we left him a twisted knot of pain
his face stained with tears and crusted with snot

He is trying to control his breath at first without
success Then slowly finally it begins to ease His
hand twisted into a kind of rigor mortis slowly begins
to relax opening like a lotus flower

TIME CUT

Dawn breaks over the wall as Ozunu returns to the dojo
to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus completely

calm the wound already beginning to heal
Ozunu shows a hint of a smile

A shuriken blade grinds against a whetstone as Raizo
sharpens the weapon with practiced gracedespite being
blindfolded
Sunlight is held back by vertical blinds
When he finishes he stands a Rodin sculpted out of
midnight
We realize there are wooden blocks placed around the
room
In his palm a single shuriken abruptly fans into many
like a deck of cards
Suddenly his arm whips around as the shurikens crack and
split the thick wooden targets
He stands alone still blindfolded

One of the OLDER NINJAS is wrapping Raizos eyes with a
sticky gauze like the tape used to wrap horses legs

MR OZUNU
For an entire year you shall live
without one of your senses
beginning with the sense you rely
on the most your sight

FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DOJO - NIGHT

Takeshis sword slides from one position to another as
Ozunu looks on

Raizo blindfolded reacts to the sound matching his
posture a fraction of a second later

OZUNU

A true Shinobi lives in darkness
The night is his weapon

Takeshi attacks again While Raizo eludes or blocks
several blows for every two he manages to block another
connects

OZUNU (CONTD)
You must see with more than your

eyes

Raizo gets up slowly releasing the tension in his jaw
He takes his position again and this time the stance is
easy his expression softer This time as Takeshi comes
at him everything becomes clear

The whistle of the blade

The zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat

The sound of his robe

Combined with Takeshis unmistakable body odor Raizo has
everything he needs to dodge slip and counter

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 32

His chain strikes wrapping an ankle throwing a stunned
Takeshi to the wall

Kiriko tries to hide her smile
Ozunu nods in appreciation

Raizo nods back as if he can see without eyes

FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT 35

Young Raizo still blindfolded is in bed Trying to
sleep but its impossible Takeshis snoring doesnt
help

He turns slightly towards Kiriko as her chest rises and
falls her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of
sea-water in a tidal pool He begins to breathe in sync
with her perhaps in hopes it will relax him

Slowly all the other sounds in the room go away until
only her breathing and his remains There is the
slight murmur of their hearts

Then she opens her eyesand smiles at him because he
cannot see her But he hears her heart begin to beat
faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips

They listen to each others breathing growing heavier
the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster

Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movementtilting
her pelvis up rubbing her hips ever so slightly against
the blanket-

Its like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo

Bump-thump bump-thump bump-thump their hearts growing

louder and louder as they become-

For a moment he didnt even
notice me Then he stood up and
kissed me and told me that he

INT ISTANBUL RAIZOS APARTMENT - DAY

Raizo sits alone Crossed-legged on the floor Utterly

still

Theres an ocean of sound swirling around him The

cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour

Raizo starts to build a dam auricular sandbags laid one

by one walling off the outside world

The traffic outside- horns engines squealing tires

rattling trucks chassis- all fade away

People shouting singing A couple next door making love

A baby wailing Jackhammers pounding

Slowly the world fades away until there is only one

sound Faint familiar but almost too quiet to hear

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 37

Raizos heartbeat
He listens to it Meditates on its simple rhythm

Until a sound explodes in the room it is a sound we
havent heard in his apartment-

A phone

He rises slowly as the phone continues to ring He
answers it silently waiting for something-

The line clicks and goes dead

EXT ISTANBUL STREET SOUK - DAY 42

Raizo walks through the crowded market Shoppers
salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the
stalls

FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past
Shouting laughing The last one jostles against Raizo as
he goes by

Raizo keeps walking but he is holding an envelope in his
hand He slips it into his pocket
EXT ISTANBUL STREET - DAY 43

Raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street
Theres a square of paper inside and a photograph

On the paper is a street address in Berlin The
photograph is a close-up of a womans face

Mika

INT MIKAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 44

Close on the box It sits on her desk calling as
another box once called to Pandora

She opens it

Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the
style of 1970s archeologists (like those of the dead sea
scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta

The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and
several sketches

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 38

There is also a very rough map that suggests the location
of The Orphanage

Images of the orphanage of the children training and
their ordeals bloody combat ritual bindings beatings
on the Nightingale floor

There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage
tree of the Nine Clans

Also in the box is a single VHS tape
She pushes the tape into the player

Its a recording of a surveillance camera staring
front of the Sabatin house

A man walks up to the house and ringss the bell
cannot see his face Sabatin opens the door They
exchange words Sabatin seems wary but invites th
in

Mika doesnt understand why this is significant

She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as t
exits She stops rewinds and plays it again

As he steps out of the shadow of the house she s

possibility of attracting trouble On the passing
floors we hear doors being opened and shut footsteps
the distant murmur of voices Could be nothing Could
be everything She presses on

INT MIKAS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 54

She opens the door to her apartment shining the tiny
light ahead of her Shadows chase each other across the
room as she swings the light one way then another
There seems to be no one else in the place But as she
hurries into her home office we see --

A shadow move behind her

As she packs she begins to hear something a tapping
The same sound she heard before She pulls the gun from
her purse With the flashlight spearing the darkness

she goes to her office

Again the window is open the blinds gently blowing
against the sash

She is certain the window had been locked

Now every shadow is alive

She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction
Her flashlight finds her suitcase On the top of her

clothes she sees it An envelope Perfectly centered

Setting the gun down she picks up the oragami-folded

envelope Opens it with a shaking finger
Black sand spills out

Terror steals her breath Behind her a shadow tilts and
reveals the eyes of a ninja

Before she can even move a blade flashes from the
darkness heading for her neck-

54

Another shadow blocks the blade knocking Mika over the
bed

The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the
combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding

darkness

Her flashlight catches glimpses Impossibly fast lethal
predators trying to kill each other

She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase
towards the gun Another blow arcs for her and is again
blocked

Her hand finds the handle of the gun She points into
the dark fires

The gun flash strobes the room freezing the two ninjas
in the blink of a flashbulb

They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying

She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she
finds them with her flashlight a blade is struck deep-

Blood erupts One shadow falls to the ground

The other turns towards her Her flashlight shakes as
the ninja reaches up and removes his mask

It is Raizo
He sees in her eyes that she knows him

RAIZO
You know me

She nods
RAIZO (CONTD)

MIKA

He waits
MIKA (CONTD)
Uhh-- Well there are these

RAIZO
Nine
MIKA
Okay Nine Nine clans And
they apparently have been
supplying assassins to governments
or anyone who happens to have one
hundred pounds of gold lying
around for the last thousand
years Give or take
He nods faintly Then turns to his dead Brother
RAIZO
His name was Jin

MIKA
You knew him
RAIZO
He was not born an Assassin

She looks at the dead body

MIKA
youre from his clan

His nod is almost imperceptible

MIKA (CONTD)
Thenwhy did you stop him
RAIZO

The clans have three kinds of
people People with power
People with money Or people
hunting them

He hears something she cant She starts to speak and

he stops her with a gesture

RAIZO (CONTD)

MIKA

RAIZO
The Hanta-Kirra
MIKA
Does that mean what I think it
means
RAIZO
They wont stop until you are

MIKA
Oh god

She looks for her gun

RAIZO
The gun wont help you

MIKA
I dont have a lot of options

but thats the extent of my Kung
Fu abilities

RAIZO
I can help but you must tell me
something first

MIKA

RAIZO
You saw Ms Sabatin

MIKA
How did you know that

RAIZO
Ive been watching you waiting
for them

She tries to compute the idea that hes been following

her

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 50 54

RAIZO (CONTD)
Did she give you something

She nods Raizos eyes lite up

RAIZO (CONTD)
You have them

Shakes her head no

MIKA
But I can get them

He hears something else

RAIZO
We need something black Hurry

She runs with the flashlight to a bureau Inside is a
black tablecloth He pulls her shoes off

RAIZO (CONTD)
Follow me Step where I step
INT MIKAS APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT 55

He leads her down through the stairwell of the large walk
up She follows him step by step

Suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway
Wrapping the tablecloth around them they melt into
darkness

Beneath the wrap he puts his hand over her mouth and
nose stopping her breath

Outside after a long beat a ninjas foot silently glides
past climbing the stairs

Inside he releases her nose Before she can finish
taking a breath he yanks her up and they quickly descend
the remaining stairs

INT MIKAS APARTMENT - NIGHT 56

The dead ninja lies in a pool of blood

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 51

The shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge born
from the black-

fq

The Hanta Kirra
Their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment his
dark eyes flashing that we recognize

Like snap-focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the
fight the bullets in the wall footprints and shattered
lights One of the killers uses his sword to trace the
line of a slashing cut in wall Braille from the blow
that Raizo used to cut the ninja

He removes his mask and we see its Takeshi

TAKESHI
Raizo

Another Ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his
nose Eyes closed Like a dog getting the scent his
inhalation a long low whisper in the silent room

DOG NINJA
Hes taken the girl

Takeshi nods turning to the windows He smiles A hunter
who knows the hunt is almost over

The sound of the assault becomes-

Raizo is silent Mika is driving

MIKA

She swallows

MIKA

RAIZO

MIKA

RAIZO

FLASHBACK - INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 64

Raizo is dressed in normal clothes his hair starting to
grow back from the close shave he had in the Orphanage
He wears a silk blindfold

Ozunu sits in the leather gloom of the stuffed
upholstery

OZUNU
You may remove the blindfold

Raizo does so Looking around at the lights of Osaka a
city he has never seen before

OZUNU (CONTD)
Your entire life has brought you
to this moment Do not fail
yourself Do not fail your
family

Raizo nods faintly

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 54

MR OZUNU
He is wearing a black and gold
watch Bring it to me

Raizo nods again then opens the door and steps out

INT FIVE STAR HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the fat wrist of a large man as he strides

across the lobby

He turns to his entourage which includes several
bodyguards and a few arm pieces

KINGPIN
Wait here Gotta piss

BODYGUARD
Want me to come with you boss

KINGPIN
Why So you can shake it for me
You some kind of secret faggot

He laughs and the arm pieces cluck on cue

He heads into the bathroom

INT FIVE STAR HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kingpin enters there is only one person in the bathroom-

Raizo washing his hands His eyes flash in the mirror
watching the Kingpin only after he has turned away

The enormous man steps into a stall After a moment he
begins to piss moaning slightly as he does

Raizo hits the air dryer button The sound fills the

room
A thin razor sharp blade flashes from his sleeve

The Kingpin continues to enjoy his piss but as we look at
him we see the door behind him silently swing open

revealing Raizo
Raizo stares at the back of the mans head He can

almost see his jugular beating beneath the thick folds
of his neck-

But something prevents him from striking

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 55
66

The dryer stops the sound of the piss dribbling when the
Kingpin suddenly looks back over his shoulder-

KINGPIN
The fuck-

Raizo strikes but the kingpin is able to deflect the blow
which sinks into his enormous body

He laughs

KINGPIN (CONTD)
That kinda tickled

He smashes a fist into Raizo that slams him backwards
KINGPIN (CONTD)
Gonna take more than a knitting

needle to fuck me up boy

Raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is
not going to be easy

Several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck
of a smaller man only seem to make the Kingpin madder

Soon both are covered in blood and gore

But it is not until Raizo slams the mans head against
the lip of the urinal-

The first time a font blood splashing up--

The second time the porcelain shatters as the Kingpins
head opens spilling black blood across the floor

EXT ROOF - NIGHT 67

It is raining
Raizo still wearing his bloody clothes climbs up onto
the roof his clothes spattered with gore

He waits as the shadows around him come to life Ozunu
Takeshi and several other clan members surround him
All but Ozunu wear their masks

Raizo extends his hand revealing the black and gold
watch smeared with fresh blood He offers it to Mr
Ozunu

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 56

OZUNU
Keep it It will remind you that
every minute of your life isa
gift that I have given you

Ozunu smiles

OZUNU (CONTD)
You have made me proud tonight
Raizo There are some who
believed you would fail but I
knew you would not

His eyes narrow

OZUNU (CONTD)
You have a strength inside you
Raizo You must use that
strength now to show me that you
are truly Ozunu

Several of the other ninjas step back Revealing
Takeshi He pushes a small hooded figure forward

OZUNU (CONTD)
Weakness compels strength

Betrayal begets blood

Takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl She
is bloody bound and gagged and for a flash-

Raizo sees her as Kiriko

OZUNU (CONTD)
A daughter that turned her back on
her family She tried to run
Takeshi hunted her down

He unsheathes his blade offering the hilt to Raizo

OZUNU (CONTD)
It is the law of the Nine Clans

Raizo looks at the girl her tears lost in the rain
We cannot tell if Raizo is crying as he takes the blade-
He CRIES OUT the light of madness in his eyes

He STRIKES lashing out with the fury of a wild animal
at Ozunu --

-- who bends back with impossible grace But not far
enough

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 57 67

The point of Raizos sword slashes across his face
opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and
mouth

He hasnt tasted his own blood in years and the anger
boils up in his eyes

OZUNU (CONTD)
Kill him

Raizo meets their attack Throwing himself into the fray
as only a man who is no longer interested in living can

But the ninjas are everywhere They hurl shuriken at him
by the handful a storm of jagged steel racing for
Raizos flesh

Raizo blocks some of the shuriken misses many more The
shuriken strike muscles tendons flesh He SWINGS
around still trying to attack there are too many of
them

He stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as Takeshi
SWINGS what he believes will be the death blow as --

-- Raizo half-falls half-leaps backward falling from
the rooftop tumbling through space until he --
-- Splashes into the canal below-

Bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood

68 INT CAR - NIGHT 68
Mika speeds along the autobahn

MIKA
Okay if youre not going to say
anything do you mind if I talk
When I get nervous it helps if I
talk

He says nothing

MIKA (CONTD)
My name is Mika by the way

RAIZO

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 58
68 68
MIKA

Yeah well usually if someone
introduces themselves it is a
convention that the other person
does likewise

He considers her

RAIZO
Raizois the name I was given

MIKA
So you were an orphan

His head nods slightly
MIKA (CONTD)

Interesting nature verses nurture
case study I imagine
He cocks an eyebrow

MIKA (CONTD)
If its okay with you Ill try to
fill in some of the blanks You
must have been taken by the Ozunu
clan trained to be an assassin
but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program
dont imagine this went over so
well and since theyre after me
for just peeking through the
eyhole they must be after you in
a major way But you are also
after them or you wouldnt have
bothered going to Sabatin Which
I figure means youre searching
for the location of The Orphanage
because thats obviously the only
information Battatus book would
have that you wouldnt already
now

He looks at her impressed

MIKA (CONTD)
Yeah I got some moves too Im
pretty lethal with the research
thing

He almost smiles

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 59
68 68

MIKA (CONTD)
But heres a question I cant
answer since you didnt know I
went to Sabatins why did you
save me

RAIZO

people The first kind has power
and money The other kind is
trying to stop them

He nods noticing shops out beyond the exit

She nods He opens his door and slips out

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408 60

the shadow of the building and disappears

She digs into her bag for the phone Maslow gave her

She TEXTS 911 But situ stable Guardian angel all in

RAIZO

He starts taking off his clothes He does it quickly
without any sense of awkwardness the world where he came
from makes little distinction between male and female
Shes not from the same world keeping herself as covered
as possible with a tree branch

He jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself
off

MIKA
Im just a researcher Im
really not equipped to deal with
this

He steps out and quickly wipes the dripping water off his
body with the branch

RAIZO
Get dressed

In the bedroom Raizo is dressed in new clothes He
lights a cigarette as Mika come out struggling with the
tightness of her new jeans

MIKA
These are a little tight

under the lid of the tire compartment Then closes the

looks at him as if somehow Raizo could see through the

He scans the different monitors

barely the strength to breathe Her lips are swollen and
cracked she sags against the tight walls of the box

He pulls a bamboo straw from his dark robe then fills
his mouth with water from a flask

Sticking the straw through the bamboo poles near her
lips he feeds her drop by drop and in this way

separated by a cage they share a kind of kiss

Her eyes part ever so slightly and she manages a smile

A handful of men splinter off for the vault while the

through the safe-house ready for whatever comes

INT SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT 89A

Mika charges into the holding area the detail of men
right at her heels

One of the teams edges through the decay of the
dilapidated industrial cavern

Straining through the eyepiece of his goggles one of them
mutters

EUROPOL AGENT 2
Dont see shit--

Ahead the point man motions and the men take up defensive
positions

The point man creeps forward a flicker of heat
fluttering in his IR-Optic

POINT MAN
Is that

Through the darkness we see that his infrared is actually
picking up the slow exhale of a ninja poised like a cobra
inches away just above him

His blades flash--

And the detail of men recoil as their infrared sensors
light up the point man cleft open in hot volcanic gore

A cloud of shuriken spit out of the darkness and punch
into necks faces eyes Ten of them fall like wheat

before a scythe The rest fire hitting nothing

The screams of dying men and gunfire shudder down the
gullet of the old concrete building

MIKA
Fuck me

She watches as the men position themselves pressing into
the black of the corridor Thumbs flick safeties to hot

A shriek pierces the silence one of the agents suddenly
jerked from his feet like a puppet on a string

They watch in IR as the agent falls to the ground in
several pieces

EUROPOL 2
What the fu--

2s exclamation gets caught in the oozing slit that
opens in his throat

The man guarding Raizos cell door screams

EUROPOL GUARD
Theyre not showing up on IR

He clicks his flashlight the beam glinting against a hail
of shuriken that pound into him wounds flowering in
ribbons of red

Mika watches as he lands wetly at her feet

More screams and gunfire shake the shock from her

She dives for the guard frantic fingers clawing at the
key-chain clipped to his belt

The remaining Europol Agents cluster together

flashlights strobing spastically while Mika slams
through Raizos cell door

She instantly goes to work on his leg irons

MIKA

The leg irons click open and Raizo springs forward the
chain of his handcuffs catching a falling blade He
twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the
dry snap of bone as Raizo breaks the ninjas neck

She releases his handcuffs and they move quickly through

the glistening remains of the bodies Raizo shielding her
from the darkness

INT SAFE-HOUSE - SUBLEVEL - NIGHT 90A

Maslow rushes down to her another agent scanning the

MASLOW

Mikas eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them
is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red

Maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side--

But before it can continue its deadly cut Maslow catches
it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows

One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the
stairs

Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side

MIKA

He nods a bit woozy

MASLOW

Raizo meets the Hanta-Kirra in the air Vaults from one
wall and door to another spinning in and out of view as
he moves through the shadows

The ninjas move with him matching his speed and ferocity
and ability to disappear within the darkness

Swords clash against chains and sword and walls Sparks
fly and blood falls

This is the first time weve seen Raizo turned loose
But its three on oneand Takeshi isnt a pushover

in the crypt-like garage before skittering for Maslows

She slides in pulling the door shut behind her as quietly
as she can--

And waits

INT SAFE-HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Maslow moves cautiously through the folds of midnight
He hears the fighting before he can see it

Raizo blocks a sword-thrust from Takeshi Dodges around
a hail of shuriken Uses his chain to drive another
Ninja back

Takeshi rips free his left arm Draws a short angled
blade and brings it slashing down at Raizos neck

Raizo blocks the knife with his elbow twists throws
Takeshi twenty feet through the air He recovers mid-
flight like a cat and regains his balance

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408

From the darkness a ninja fires a dozen shuriken at him
and at least three of the spinning blades find their
mark

Raizo grunts at the impact but vaults up and over a
counter and LEAPS through a window crashing out to -

MIKA (CONTD)

She twists the ignition and as the motor turns over--

The cars headlights explode shattered by projectiles
that seem to materialize from the void

Mika screams throwing the car into gear--
Peeling out toward the down ramp

The car fishtails down level after level through the
oscillating lightdark of the dimly lit exit ramp

Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up
ahead--

A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a
spider

She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a
squall of stars

The sedan rebounds into the light Its hood and

windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great
White

GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6408

Mika cranks the wheel tearing around a dark bend as--
Toom Something lands on the roof of the car

Above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws
that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as-

She passes under a light--

Revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her through
the sun roof

His blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike--

She jams the barrel of the Glock between the two tips of
one set of claws right where his foot should be--

And fires

A scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over
the sunroof--

The ninjas body tumbling off the back of the car

Maslows gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of
sparks as it corners into traffic

Mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell
phone

the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much
tossed change He looks up at winged victory silhouetted
against the moonlight

And suddenly the ninja are on him

Raizo blocks and parries Counterattacks with a reverse
cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes

roaring down at him

The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and
three tons of death

Raizo cartwheels over the hood forcing the Scarred Ninja
to leap the other way and as he turns --

-- Raizo comes down on him slashing his shoulder

Hers is a shame that can only be

purged with blood

He unsheathes the ancient Wakizashi then offers the hilt
to Takeshi

OZUNU (CONTD)
You who returned her shall have
this honor

Takeshi hides a smile as he takes the blade

Kiriko looks out into the clan and finds Raizo He can
hear her heart pounding

Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to
strike

Blood pounds in Raizos ears
The sword plunges into her heart Raizo hears it die-

And feels his own heart stop

INT ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT 115
A bucket of water slaps Raizo awake

Hes bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by
thick rope that bites into his flesh

Ozunu stands before him as well as the rest of the clan
down to the youngest of them Watching silently

He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except
that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length
of his face Trace of Raizos blade from atop the
building in Dubai

When he speaks Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the
rest of the clan as to Raizo

OZUNU
You are Ozunu Your life is
meaningless compared to the
survival of the Clan This is our
deepest truth Because of it we
have endured for hundreds of
years and will endure for
hundreds more

small piece of Raizos flesh from the upper arm Raizo
doesnt cry out

For seven days we
willtakefrom you as I have
just done Everyone here will
take from you Piece by piece
You will live through it all you
will feel through it all You
will watch as the birds fight over

He STRIKES Raizo as he did long ago his hand jutting
deep inside gut flicking switches of nerves that cause
instant agony This time Raizo does cry out

OZUNU (CONTD)
You will know pain like no other

human being has ever known

One last gouge in Raizos stomach sends a heaving shudder
through him

Confident victorious Ozunu turns and walks a few steps
away as --

-- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor

Takeshi smiles at this then looks more closely seeing
something amidst the bile

TAKESHI

Ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder A
single LED light blinking through the gore

He nudges it with his footand TIME SLOWS DOWN as he
realizes what hes looking at He slowly raises his eyes

-- and meets Raizos gaze as suddenly --
-- EXPLOSIONS rock the orphanages centuries-old gate

A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of
splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of
blinding lights

The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves
into the courtyard revealing behind it still more
vehicles all equipped with brilliant lights

The ninjas take to the shadows trying to melt away but
the shadows are gone Theres no place for the ninjas to
hide anymore We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead
vehicles as --

-- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc raising it
over Raizos helpless form

Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off
a long burst

Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and
dodges the others He slides into one of the few
remaining shadows

One of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and
fires an incendiary grenade

The explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous
splashing through the courtyard but Takeshi is gone
They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the
run

MASLOW
No more grenades not until we get

the children out

But some parts of the orphanage are already on fire the
flames spreading through the ancient timbers

The carnage continues

Maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for
Raizo pistol in hand

One of the MPs screams as a shuriken rips open his face
as other Mps FIRE back at the ninja tearing him apart
with gunfire

Mika makes it to Raizos side

He smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her
knife

RAIZO
What took you

MIKA
You knew Id come

RAIZO
Just because I was asleep doesnt
mean I couldnt hear you

Mika finishes with the rope Raizo pulls free and
reaches for a fallen ninjas sword and chain

Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on
steel Neither giving an inch Evenly matched in skill
and ferocity Locking together for a moment Takeshi
smiles

No death tasted as sweet as hers

Raizos back glistens orange in the firelight sweat
pouring as he strains attacks defends and attacks
again

Takeshi jumps over them twists mid-air and ducks low
beneath Raizos swinging chain as --

-- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor blocking
Takeshis attack but --

-- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip As he
brings his sword around Raizo gets a loop of chain
around the blade and locks it tight

Both men spin in their sudden embrace Faces inches from
each other

I watched you die when I pierced

He moves to slam it into Raizos sidebut Raizo FLIPS

-- DRIVES the steel into Takeshis heart He still
stands for a BEAT more by inertia than will then
slumps dead to the floor

Ozunu steps out of the darkness as though shrugging off
a cloak of midnight

His blade rises as like a Cobras hood while the chain
blade begins to spin

Raizo finds them

He sees Kiriko the same blade taking her life and howls--
His pain a force of nature unleashed

The chain blades crackle in the air-

Dual cyclones that batter Ozunus parrying blade which-
Finally shatters against Raizos fury

And with a final scream Raizo lunges at his master the
whistling blades lazering through his body until he
separates pieces hanging in mid-air like an unstitched
rag doll

Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--

--hurries to Mikas side He picks Mika up and walks

through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the
door

He smiles distantly
