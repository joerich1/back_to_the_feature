DEAR AL PLEASS FIND ENCLOSED
AN IDEA FOR THE FILM SPOKE TO ONS OR TWO PROPLE HERE
WHO COULD NOT FOLLOW STORY WHEN THEY SAW THE FILM
AS A RESULT COMMENTS INCLUDED DISAPPOINTING RIP OFF
THE STORY IS FEEBLE ALSO JUST A LOAD OF ROCKSTARS POSING AROUT

I DID NOT DEFEND OR VOICE ANY OPINIONS BUT I PUMPED THEM AND
DISCOVERED THAT NONE OF THE STORY IS GETTING OVER SO WITHOUT
SPEAKING TO ANYONE I SAT DOWN TO WRITE YOU A LBETTSR HOWEV5R

A SMALL IDEA CAME TO ME WHICH I BEGAN TO LIKE VERY MUCH

BENEFITS INCLUDE I) pwkawkmxy puts story over

2 ) ADDS depth ae a
3 ) is cheap to do

4 ) requires no cutting of film as is

5 ) contains new presentation idea

WHEN I HEAR DICK SAY I HATE NARRATION AND WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY
I M NOT GOING TO ADD NARRATION JUST TO SAVE A FILM
I REALIZE WE ARE PROBARLY DOOMED TO A DISASTROUS RECEPTION

FROM THE CRUTICS AND PUBLIC IN FEBUARY Y ET ARS THESE ATTITUDES
WISE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

XSWXWHATEMERZXXREARXXX ANYWAY PLEASE SIT DOWN COMFORTABLY AND

ALONE AND REALLY TRY AND VISUALIZE THIS AS YOU RBAD IT AS A PUNTER
MIGHT SEE IT I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS WITH NO ONE IF YOU THINK IT
IS A GOER OR IS A GOOD SPRINGBOARD FOR ADDTIONAL IDEAS PLEASE
DISCUSS IT WITH MIGUEL

MY MOTHER DIED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE I HAVE JUST
RETURNED TO LONDON AFTER THE FUNERAL WILL SEND THAT SONG MICK AISO
NDING SOMBTHING PROBABLY IN DESMO FORM a a

REMEMBER I M BATTING FOR YOU
LOVE FROM THE DESERTED CITY

p

this idea can be put over in four inserts
and reouires no re editine of the film st ell

(except maybe two front teeth bit )

also its a gooa idea to present the film as if it was

on a video you rented in 2059 May be precedeed by
couple of Space age advert parodies of today s
favourite cinema adverts ak in the future home video

rent cassettes might come complete

with introductory
story teller man

thats why he Say s thanks for renting me
an dont forget to Switch off the cat

because a1 films are seen at home in 2059

what do you think fax me
