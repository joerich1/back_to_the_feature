Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to
the
ground as Rocklin climbs up to the drivers seat
ROCKLIN
(as he steps up to
the seat)
-- and a passenger
Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat and he
is
about to order him down when Rocklin now seated looks
down

at him and asks rather wistfully --

ROCKLIN
Mind if I ride up here

Dave does mind but his better judgment tells him to
step
carefully in his attitude toward this stranger who
does

things first then asks permission His only answer to
Rocklin

is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough
And

now Dave turns on the Agent who becomes the target of
his

pent-up wrath

DAVE
Wheres them wimmen

HAROLDAY
Good morning Julio -- morning Arly

dismounts)
Fetch my briefcase -- its on my

Julio exits
HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO
still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin
seems
lost in thought After regarding her a moment Harolday
speaks

HAROLDAY
Looks like were going to get that
land weve been wanting along the
river bottom

Arly turns her eyes on Harolday who continues

HAROLDAY
I didnt tell you -- but I bought
the mortgage on the Hardman ranch
and its due today -- On my way over
there now

Arlys eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly

ARLY
Did you send that Rocklin to Table-
Top

HAROLDAY

I did
ARLY

(furiously)
Well lets get things straight
This place was my mothers -- now
its mine and Clints -- Its true
youve been helping out -- but the
way things are going well soon be
able to pay you back every penny we
owe Meanwhile Im running this
outfit and I expect to give the
orders

HAROLDAY

ARLY
Why did you send Rocklin up to Table-
Top

HAROLDAY
It seemed to me a good idea -- what

with all this rustling going on --

ARLY
Whod ever try driving cattle over
Table-Top -- Unless they were crazy
HAROLDAY
(coldly)
I dont agree with you In any case --
if you must have it -- Id no

intention of engaging a man at
foremans wages just to gratify the
whims of a jealous woman

ARLY
(dangerously)
You take care what youre saying

HAROLDAY

(very controlled)
Its you should take care my dear
Im afraid theres one man you cant
rawhide into jumping the way you
want Youve made a fool of yourself

all gooey Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace

Rocklins voice is heard over the insert as he reads
here

ROCKLINS VOICE
(reading)
Forgive me if this letter is a trifle
incoherent but I am terribly worried
and unhappy

BACK TO SCENE

DAVE
Who wouldnt be -- livin with that
ole screech owl

ROCKLIN
(continues to read)

I am desperately in need of help and
advice from someone whom I feel I

can trust and I am appealing to

you because I regard you in the

same way my Uncle surely must have

I heartily dislike and distrust Judge
Garvey --

DAVE
(interrupting)
Huh -- Smart girl --

ROCKLIN
(going on)
But my Aunt seems to have suddenly
revised her opinion of him and now
wants me to place all my affairs in
the Judges hands and return east
Such is certainly not my wish

DAVE
(significantly)
Looks kinda like shes formed an
attachment

Rocklin glares up to Dave

DAVE
(quickly)
For the locality I mean

ROCKLIN
(continues reading)
I wanted so much to give ranch life
a trial but fear circumstances are
against me especially in view of
the recent Indian trouble --

DAVE
(explosively)
Indian trouble --
(in normal tone)
Good Lord they aint been any Indian
trouble around here in --

ROCKLIN
(caustically)
You want to hear the rest of this

DAVE
(getting the inference)
Mights well -- come this far

ROCKLIN
(reading)
I want to apologize for what took
place this afternoon And I am
returning the 150 because I feel it
is rightfully yours You must take
it Faithfully yours Clara Caldwell

The letter finished Rocklin regards it a moment then

slowly
returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully
into the
fire
Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy
top
and turns his attention once more to his drying
clothes
DAVE
(feeling his socks)
Well -- what do you make of it
Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the
letter
back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a
cigarette
ROCKLIN
Somebodys sure bustin to get her
out of there
Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his
socks

DAVE
Indian trouble --

ROCKLIN
(after a pause)
Wonder why the old ladys playin

along
DAVE
(sourly)
Baaa -- Wimmen -- Who can ever figure
em
(pause)
Got to admit though I feel a mite
sorry for the youngun -- nice little
tyke
ROCKLIN

Too nice for this country

DAVE
(after a slight pause)
Shes shore a pretty thing

Rocklin has been mulling things over

ROCKLIN
Dont know how I could help her --
even if I wanted to -- I dont know
any thing about this Garvey -- or
Caldwell -- or --

DAVE
Well now -- I could mebbe help you
out some there -- Fact I could

tell you somethin bout ole Red
that might be interestin

ROCKLIN
You must have known him pretty well --
What kind of a man was he

Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits

Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer

shirt

DAVE
Caldwell -- The best -- cantankerous
cuss -- but a real cowman believe
me -- He was a big feller like
yourself -- Fact you coulda passed
fer a blood relation come to think
of it

ROCKLIN

(casually as he busies
himself with the
biscuits)

Was the Judge and Red friends

DAVE

(anigmatically)
Thats what youd say Garvey managed
all Reds business Besides which
they was regular drinkin pals --
played poker together most nights --
tho they do say Red got the worst
of it

ROCKLIN
Red was a gambler eh

DAVE
Oh yeah -- reckon a pretty poor
one tho -- still youd say him and
Garvey was friends

ROCKLIN
(after a side glance
to Dave)
Anything ever happen to make you
think they werent

DAVE
(moves close to Rocklin)
Rock -- Im gonna tell you somethin
I aint never told anybody

ROCKLIN
(with a slight smile)
Think you can trust me

Dave grimaces his confidence

DAVE
The last time I seen Red was the day
he died --

In the pause Rocklin remains silent

DAVE
-- Twas in town -- he jus come out
of the stage office Tried to book
passage to Garden City but couldnt
on account I had a full load --
Well sir he took me aside and give
me a printed sheet of paper and says
Read it I looked it over and fer
as could see it was a paper from
one of them Chicago sportin firms
tellin how to manipulate trick
playin cards

ROCKLIN
Marked cards

DAVE
(nods)
Reckon so -- Seems Red found some
cards and this paper in a coat one
of his friends loaned him one night

ROCKLIN
Whose was it
as

DAVE
Well now thats just what I asked --
but all he said was that it belonged
to a good friend Then he said he
wasnt waitin fer the next coach
but was ridin over to see the
district judge about it alone

ROCKLIN
Thats when they got him

DAVE
Yes sir -- bout a mile or so from
Stans place A bullet in the back
an his pockets empty

ROCKLIN
How come you never told this before

DAVE
Who was there to tell -- Sheriff
Jackson -- Him an Garveys thick
as thieves
ROCKLIN
How about whats his name -- Harolday

Hes no friend of the Judges is
he

DAVE
Hates his guts -- sure riles him to
see young Clint hangin onto the
Judges coattails All the same I
jus decided to keep my mouth shut
and my eyes open

ROCKLIN
(after a pause)
Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin
about -- it dont follow that he
killed him

DAVE
No -- general opinion is that it was
rustlers

ROCKLIN
Why would rustlers take the evidence
Caldwell had with him

Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water
directly

Dave talks

DAVE
Looks to me if you get the man who
owned the marked cards you get the
killer

ROCKLIN
(drinking)
Funny tho -- first the KC foreman --
then Caldwell -- an now these women

DAVE
Lordy -- you aint thinkin somebody
might try bumpin them

ROCKLIN

(slowly to himself)
Im not so sure somebody hasnt tried
already --

(to Dave)
Remember when we stopped to change
horses on the way Over from Garden
City --

DAVE

Shore -- you told me how Jackson and
Clews tried to frame Stan

ROCKLIN

Yeah Like they wanted to be sure
hed keep his mouth shut about

He looks back in Daves direction and then looking

moving in the faint glow of the dying fire

It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant
The two regard each other like vicious animals in the

cage Arlys heart is pounding but you would never

And now Rocklin his gun away starts closing in

but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving

When Rocklin reaches Arly he takes her one hand from
her back and slowly forcing it up sees what is
Claras letter in her tightly clenched fist He tries
open her hand and Arly knowing she lacks the strength
prevent it suddenly whips out a knife with her free
But that quick Rocklin grabs the knife hand and
any apparent effort wrenches it free of her grasp and
it across the room where it lands on the bunk Arly
her grip on the letter meanwhile and Rocklin gets it
tears it very deliberately letting the pieces fall at
feet
He turns his back on her now going over to his hat on
floor
Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation
Rocklins smug manner isnt helping any He picks up
and glancing at Arly puts his finger once more
bullet holes

ROCKLIN

(smiling wryly)
Not bad shootinâ€™
ARLY
(right back at him)
You think I did that

ROCKLIN
Sure -- to draw us away from here
(looks at his hat)
You know you cut it mighty close --
Good thing I aint got brains enough
to fill it

Rocklin puts his hat on He sees Arly looking down at
the
torn letter

ROCKLIN
(suppressing smile)
Too bad you had to come way up here
through that storm for nothinâ€™

ARLY
(affectedly)
I havent minded a bit --
(harshly)
-- because I came up to fire you

ROCKLIN

Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag

ARLY

Get out of here -- get off the Santee
and dont ever come back

ROCKLIN
Mind if I wait for Dave He ought to
be along any minute -- Be funny if

he winged that shadow of yours

ROCKLIN
Who was he

ARLY
I dont know

ROCKLIN
You mean you wont tell

ARLY
I mean I dont know -- Why should I
lie to you
That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklins
a smile that says in effect -- Are you kidding He
from the bunk to go to the door and finding himself

holding Arlys knife throws it back to her ina

casual manner It passes too close to Arly for comfort

Rocklin just opening the door gets the knife right
that close to his ear he feels the breeze He looks at
quivering in the door Then moving to Arly in what
construed as a threatening manner he takes her in his
and kisses her Arly is caught completely unaware
action disarms her But it is after all what she
wants so before the kiss ends Arlys arms slowly
themselves around Rocklins neck In the middle of the

Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from
neck and puts her from him

I guess you forgot -- you jes fired

INT GARVEYS OFFICE - DAY
Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the
drawer
marked C As he fingers through the papers Garvey
sits
back in his chair watching
GARVEY
What is your interest in this letter
ROCKLIN
My only interest is getting it
GARVEY
You realize what this is dont you --
Robbing -- armed robbery at that
Rocklin pulls open the M drawer
GARVEY
I warn you youre in for a
disappointment
Not finding the letter in the M drawer Rocklin goes
to
the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers It
is
locked
ROCKLIN
Open up
GARVEY

(has had about enough)
Listens you --

(suddenly controls

himself)
Theres nothing in there thatd
interest you

ROCKLIN
(grimly)
Id like to make up my own mind about
that
GARVEY

(forces a chuckle)
All right -- Ill open it -- just to
convince you Im not hiding any
letter

Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it It is found to
contain
nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards

The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS

BACK TO SCENE Garvey seems a little too anxious to
close

the drawer and before he can do so Rocklin has one
hand

inside Garvey checked for a second looks up at
Rocklin

GARVEY
Whats the idea

Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand holding one of the
decks

ROCKLIN
These cards --

GARVEY
(attempting to bluff
it out)
Anything wrong in a man having cards
in his possession

ROCKLIN
Depends on what kind they are --
specially when theyre under lock
and key

The two regard each other silently a moment Now
Rocklin
casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket

GARVEY
(too politely)
Youre taking those I presume

ROCKLIN
Thats right

He takes a step away Garvey turns him by touching his
arm

GARVEY

(has had almost enough)
Now you look here --

ROCKLIN
(soberly)
Youre the one who better start
lookin -- lookin for a way out for

killin Red Caldwell

GARVEY
(blanches)
Caldwell --
ROCKLIN

(takes up one of the

decks of cards)
He found out about these -- and you
went and killed him

GARVEY
(with an affected
smile and unnatural
calmness)
And you believe a story like that

ROCKLIN
I will until I hear a better one
(puts deck he holds
in his pocket)
Ill just take this along -- the
district judge at Garden City should
be mighty interested
He starts around the desk toward the door From the
of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the
drawer Before he can raise it Rocklin is on him with
blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove
Rocklin starts for the door again and just misses
struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury
chair crashes against a window

ROCKLIN
No -- but I dont think its gonna

ROCKLIN
No trouble at all -- Im going anyway

You look like youve been fighting

ROCKLIN

What are you doin here

ARLY
I was just telling Miss Caldwell

ROCKLIN

What about you an me

CLARA

in the atmosphere)

Oh -- oh really Id rather not --

goes on defiantly)

ROCKLIN
Deny what

CLARA
That she was with you last night at
the cabin in the mountains

ROCKLIN
Well -- why should I deny it

ARLY
(quickly)
And didnt you make love to me

ROCKLIN

bit thick for him)
Make love to you --

ARLY
(forcing her point)
You didnt kiss me -- I suppose
ROCKLIN

Did you expect me to deny that too

ARLY
(smiles at Clara)
You see

ROCKLIN
(to Clara)
Now maybe you ought to hear what
Ive got to say --

Clara is terribly hurt but struggles to be grown-up
about

at Arly)

Dont think too harshly of me will

Clara can say no more without breaking So she turns
quickly and hurries out the door Rocklin does a slow

as he glares at Arly

ARLY
(sincerely -- after a
pause)
Shes lovely isnt she -- So sweet --

honest and helpless
Rocklin makes no reply

ARLY
Pity you didnt fall in love with
her instead of me

Arly is being ridiculous now He ignores her remarks
concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he
have sprained it slightly in the fight

comes into view in the bg He spots Arly who has her
back
to him and walks over His approach frightens the
woodchuck
away and turns Arlys head toward him Neither has
anything
to say Now Rocklin sits beside Arly but faces the
other
way
ROCKLIN
(after a pause)

Thanks

ARLY
For what

ROCKLIN
Everything

There is another stilted pause

ARLY
(her eyes sweeping
the morning)
Beautiful day

ROCKLIN
(reflecting)
It didnt start out so beautiful

ARLY
Thats true of lots of things

ROCKLIN
Fer instance

ARLY
(hesitantly)
Well -- you and -- me

There is another pause But worlds are being said in
the

language of eyes Their heads move closer and now
Rocklins

arms sweep around the girl and they kiss

GROUNDS NEAR ARLY AND ROCKLIN DAVE AND JULIO HURRYING

THROUGH
THE GRASS
DAVE
(shouting)
Hey Rock -- Rock -- get out your

pencil and paper --
The two stop abruptly and look os

ON ROCKLIN AND ARLY KISSING ON DAVE AND JULIO

DAVE

(grimacing)
Doggone it -- here Garvey is back in
this world -- an theyre out of it

FADE OUT
THE END
