Lindsays side of the bed but

boxspring And I find my way out
into the hallway and go into
Coopers room but hes not there
either And I run down the hall
again to check on Skylar but shes
not in her crib And then I
realize its not even my house
Im in some shitty one-bedroom
walk-up in Uptown And I turn
around and a window appears And I
chuck myself right the fuck out of
it
