FADE IN

We hear the sounds of heavy breathing over darkness The
breathing builds to overwhelming anticipation as we

PULL BACK to reveal weve been looking at a HOME MADE
EXPLOSIVE

A pair of gloved hands methodically places a second explosive
a few feet from the first

Suddenly the hands freeze the sound of breathing is
silenced as the beam of a flashlight falls just a few feet
away

INT DARK HALLWAY

The light bounces around for a beat before falling on the
explosive We pull back to reveal veteran police Officer
CHARLIE PIPER late 30s holding the flashlight

PIPER
Lets get out of here kid

He is followed by his partner rookie officer SEAN FARMER

PIPER (CONTD)
(into radio)
This is Officer Piper we need a
bomb squad dispatched immediately
to the fifth floor of 1122
Westfield Apartments

As Piper continues down the hall Farmer stands frozen eyes
fixated on the bomb directly in front of him

He slowly bends down to get a closer look at the explosive
Directly behind him we seea MAN IN A GAS MASK

Farmer freezes sensing someone behind him He quickly turns
to findnothing The hall is empty

FARMER
Hey Piper I think our perp is
still
He turns around to find no sign of his partner

FARMER (CONTD)
Piper

With the single beam from his flashlight to lead the way
Farmer makes his way down the hall Suddenly we hear the
sound of footstepsrunning

Farmers quickly looks in the direction of the steps He sees
nothing Soon the halls are silent again

Suddenly he hears them again only behind him this time He
quickly turns and shines the light toward the noise

The light manages to illuminate the hall just enough for
Farmer to catch a glimpse ofthe masked perpetrator

Instinctively he gives chase

He quickly turns the corner to find an empty hallway With
his gun drawn Farmer nervously shouts down the hall

FARMER (CONTD)
NYPD come out with your hands
up

A nosey resident of the complex peeks her head out of her
doorway

FARMER (CONTD)
Go back inside maam Everything is
under control

The resident does as she is told Farmer becoming
frustrated raises his voice

FARMER (CONTD)
I repeat come out with your
hands

A hand quickly grabs a hold of his shoulder Farmer nearly
jumps through the roof as he whirls around and points his gun
atPiper
PIPER
Fuck Rookie youre a mess Put
that down before you hurt yourself

Farmer breathes a sigh of relief and lowers his gun
Suddenly his eyes grow wide and he quickly raises his
firearm

PIPER (CONTD)
What the fuck is your problem

FARMER
Get out of the way

Farmer shines his flashlight directly behind Pipers head to
revealthe man in the gas mask He towers only inches away
from Piper Piper quickly backs toward his partner

PIPER
Get out of here Farmer

Pipers flashlight PANS DOWN to reveal the perpetrator is
strapped from head to toe with more explosives Farmer
remains frozen

PIPER (CONTD)
Go

Piper grabs Farmer by the shirt and forcefully pushes him to
the safety of a side hallway We follow Farmer as he regains
his footing Hes quick to have second thoughts and takes a
step back toward the corner

Suddenly hes knocked backwards from the awesome power of a
huge EXPLOSION Farmer watches helpless from the ground as
the explosion sends Piper completely engulfed in flames
flying through a wall

Almost immediately the halls are overwhelmed with Pipers
horrific screams of agony as we

CUT TO
INT FARMERS APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

Farmer covered in sweat suddenly jerks awake
He takes a moment to gain his composure before sitting up
and reaching for a bottle of whiskey on the night stand

Farmer puts the bottle to his lips only to discover its
empty

He tosses the bottle to the floor as he slowly pulls himself
out of bed and heads to the bathroom We get a good look at
Farmer’s apartment Its a complete mess

Empty liquor bottles dirty clothing and discarded beer cans
line the floor

EXT CITY STREET - LATER

Farmer makes his way down the filthy sidewalk passing lowlife
after lowlife He enters a diner as a vagrant is being tossed
out

INT DINER

Farmer takes a seat at the end of the counter and nods to the
elderly attendant LARRY

LARRY
Sean How ya doing

FARMER
Still alive You

Larry sits a cup of coffee in front of Farmer

LARRY
No complaints The usual

FARMER
Why not

Farmer opens the morning paper and begins reading

LARRY
Any good news

FARMER
Never

Larry continues assisting other customers Suddenly the
sounds of a young couple arguing from the back of the
restaurant disturb everyone’s morning
MAN
Do you know how fucking stupid you
are

WOMAN

I’m sorry baby please

Farmer along with everyone else tries their best to ignore
the obnoxious pair At least until the man decides to grab
the girl by the hair

MAN
You think you could do better
without me

Farmer anxiously taps his spoon on the counter as the man
yanks the woman to her feet and begins pulling her by the
arm towards the exit

WOMAN
Frankie you’re hurting me

The patrons sit in awe No one gets involved until

Farmer jumps up and positions himself in between the couple
and the exit

MAN (CONTD)
Fuck you looking at man
(beat)
You gonna move or do I gotta move
ya

Farmer says nothing He just gives the man a cold stare He
looks at the crying woman and notices blood on her lip

WOMAN
(to her man)
I’m sorry sweetie

MAN
Shut up
(to Farmer)
Man I’m about to beat your

Without warning Farmer throws a left punch breaking the man’s
nose Its followed by a right forearm to the jaw which send
several teeth flying across the diner

The man instantly drops to the floor out cold Farmer turns
to the bleeding woman

FARMER
Are you alright
WOMAN
Fuck you asshole

The woman is quick to comfort her boyfriend Farmer turns and
notices the entire diner staring at him

Farmer shakes his head in disbelief as returns to his seat
and sips his coffee

LARRY
Poor girl She deserves better

Farmer continues to read his paper

FARMER
We all do

Suddenly Farmer’s cell phone begins to ring He sits for a
minute before answering it

FARMER (CONTD)
This is Farmer

INT ABANDONED CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER

Farmer brushes by two ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS and slowly
makes his way inside

He approaches a familiar face in the crowd SAM a uniformed
officer in his mid 20s is standing over a body covered in
what used to be a white sheet now soaked red with blood

SAM
Hey Farmer youre gonna shit when

you see this

FARMER
After three years of this youd be
surprised what a person can

The officer bends down and lifts part of the sheet revealing
the victim to Farmer

FARMER (CONTD)
Shit

The mangled remains of a blonde woman with more than half her
face missing is enough to make Farmer turn away from the
gruesome scene as we flash to
(Quick flash Scenes of vicious dogs going crazy struggling
to reach something)

BENNY late 20’S a second uniformed officer who’s more than
willing to walk over anyone on his way to the top makes his
way over to Farmer

BENNY
So glad you could join us Farmer

FARMER
That’s Detective Farmer

Benny gives him a condescending look

BENNY
Only because the bars aren’t open
this early

Farmer ignores his greatest critic and slowly makes his way
over to two chains attached to a back wall

SAM
They were holding two dogs
(beat)
We had to put them down as soon as
we got here

Farmer turns his attention to a third chain attached to a
different wall than the others It lies only inches away from
the victims body

Farmer looks at the huge bloodstain on the floor by the third
chain He throws on a pair of plastic glove and slowly bends
down to get a closer look

FARMER
How many dogs did you have to put
down

SAM

Only two but

Farmer picks up what looks like a huge chunk of dog fur
FARMER
-but it looks like there was a
third here

SAM

Yeah were still looking for it

FARMER
With this much blood loss it
couldnt have gone far
(beat)
If the dogs were all chained why
did our victim even go near them

(Quick flash The victim screams as she struggles to pull
herself away from the dogs)

The officer yanks the sheet up to reveal more of the bite-
covered body to Farmer This time we see that she is
handcuffed and chained to the floor

As the victims screams begin to build in the background we
see Farmer staring at what’s left of the victim’s face

SAM
Farmer

The screams suddenly stop as Farmer snaps out of it and
glances at his watch

FARMER
I gotta be somewhere Make sure
the file gets to my desk

SAM
You might want to take a look at
this before you go

Farmer grimaces as he looks down at his watch One of the
officers moves a piece of heavy drywall to reveal a room
directly behind the wall with the chains

We follow Farmer as he examines the room Its no bigger
than a closet just large enough fora person

(Quick flash Shadowed figure in the tiny room holding the
chains He slowly gives up some slack and the heavy chains
slide through a hole in the wall From his POV we watch
the vicious dogs get closer to the terrified victim)

Sam points to several wires protruding from the wall

SAM (CONTD)
Audio visual wires

FARMER
Sick fuck recorded the whole thing

INT WAITING ROOM - LATER

Farmer opens the door and walks inside what should be your
typical doctors waiting room

FARMER
Sorry Im late Amy there was

Only today the place is completely dark and an unanswered
phone sits ringing on the reception desk

FARMER (CONTD)
Amy

Hes answered by a crunching sound at his feet He looks
down and notices SHATTERED GLASS on the floor along with some
BLOOD He tries the light switch on the wall behind him It
doesn’t work

Farmer draws his gun as he takes a look around

The place is a complete mess Files and assorted papers line
the floor A bookshelf has been tossed on its side

He slowly makes his way to the far door at the end of the
waiting area and carefully pushes it open

INT DR JENNIFER WALKERS OFFICE- CONTINUOUS

A desk lamp dimly lights the room as he cautiously makes his
way inside

The doctors office is a mess Several file cabinets are
open with folders and papers thrown all over the place A
light beaming from underneath a bathroom door catches
Farmer’s attention

FARMER
Jennifer

There’s no answer as Farmer quickly steps toward the light
He reaches for the handle when he notices BLOOD on the door

Suddenly the door opens

FARMER (CONTD)
Dont fucking move

Staring into the barrel of his gun is the stunning DR
JENNIFER WALKER early 30s an incredible beauty with an
impressive intellect to match her looks

JENNIFER
(startled)
Jesus Christ Sean

Farmer quickly lowers his firearm

FARMER
Im sorry When I called and you
didnt answer I thoughtIm
sorry

JENNIFER
There was a break in over the
weekend and Amy didnt show up
today
(beat)
I was hoping to have the place
cleaned up before you arrived

Farmer notices Jennifers hand wrapped in a bloody towel

JENNIFER (CONTD)
They broke the light in the other
room and I cut myself trying to
clean it up

FARMER
Let me take a look at it

Farmer places her hand in his and examines the wound

JENNIFER
Im fine Sean

Their eyes meet for only a few seconds but its more than
enough to expose the awkward tension between them

She slowly pulls her hand back causing Farmer to nervously
walk to the other side of the room He bends down to pick a
file up off the floor

Jennifer quickly moves across the room and grabs it out of
his hand Theyre face to face and left with an uncomfortable
silence

FARMER
You know the lighting in here
really sets the mood

JENNIFER
Yeah

Farmer moves in close to her She allows herself to smile
for a moment

JENNIFER (CONTD)
You know what would really set the
mood

INT WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We see Farmer on a small ladder changing the broken light
bulb

FARMER
This wasnt exactly what I had in
mind

JENNIFER
These sessions would be a lot more
effective if you started treating
me like your doctor instead of the
object of your affections

FARMER
I still dont know why you cant be
both

JENNIFER
Weve gone over this before
(beat)
How have you been sleeping

Farmer finished putting the light bulb into the socket

FARMER
Try the light

Jennifer flips the switch

JENNIFER
You know I think your dreams are
probably

Jennifers voice slowly drowns out as farmer remains fixated
on the flickering bulb above his head After a beat the light
stays on accompanied by a heavy buzz The bright light and
buzzing becomes overwhelming as we

CUT TO
INT HALLWAY

The bright light of the bulb is quickly replaced with Piper
completely engulfed in flames flying through a wall and into
an apartment

Were back in the hallway with Farmer He stands frozen in
fear watching his partner burn alive Piper flails around
in pain setting everything he contacts on fire

Farmer only inches away from a fire extinguisher remains
motionless with fear

For the first time we notice a woman inside the apartment
ELENA PHOENIX shielding her teenage son JASON from the
fire She starts to step toward Farmer but quickly stops

ELENA
The extinguisher

Farmer doesnt move The woman tries to step closer but
cant bring herself to make it out into the hallway
Instead she turns and grabs a blanket to smother Piper

Piper’s screams slowly grow silent as he lies motionless on
the ground Elena and Jason watch helplessly as the fire
starts to over take their tiny apartment

ELENA (CONTD)
Please save my son

Farmer finally snaps out of it and quickly makes his way
inside the womans apartment

In one quick swoop he picks up Jason and throws him over his
shoulder As the room continues to burn he grabs his
partner by the legs and begins to drag him to safety

FARMER
(to the woman)
Just stay close

Farmer quickly makes his way down the hall with his partner
and the boy We stay with Elena as she remains frozen

Behind the petrified woman the entire apartment fills with
smoke and flame as we

CUT TO
INT WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Farmer staring into the light remains transfixed on his
memory Jennifer can be heard quietly calling his name

JENNIFER
(with a sigh)
Are you even listening to me

Farmer quickly snaps out of his trance and back into
reality

FARMER
Huhwhat

JENNIFER
You couldnt have saved Elena
Phoenix Sean Her fear of leaving
her apartment

FARMER
Agoraphobia I’ve been reading up
on it

Farmer begins his descent from the ladder Not really paying
attention he loses his footing Jennifer is quick to react
and is there to break his fall

Farmers weight pulls them both to the floor He lands on top
of her with a mischievous smile

FARMER (CONTD)
Are you okay

Their eyes lock The tension is overwhelming as they lean in
toward one another Their lips are inches away from each
other when

Farmers cell phone begins to ring

FARMER (CONTD)
Shit Sorry

Farmer pulls out his phone and gets up off the floor

FARMER
This is Farmer

JENNIFER
I was just thinking

Farmer holds up his index finger indicating he needs a
minute

FARMER
Ill be there in twenty minutes

Farmer glances at Jennifer apologetically

FARMER (CONTD)
Were gonna have to finish this
session later

JENNIFER
(irritated)
Technically we never got started

FARMER
Yeah sorry about that Ill call
you later

Jennifer tries to remain professional

JENNIFER
To reschedule your appointment
right

Farmer gives Jennifer an endearing smile and exits the room

INT CITY MORGUE - LATER

Farmer goes over the case file while the medical examiner
MIKE EMBRY 60S examines the autopsied remains of the woman

and the two dogs

MIKE
Well I can tell you that these
dogs were purposely starved They
were fed just enough to keep them

alive and angry

FARMER
A handcuffed victim doesnt have
much of a fighting chance

MIKE
I was able to locate your third
dog well pieces of it anyway

FARMER
And

MIKE
And these two had it for dessert
It was a smaller breed Chunks of
it were found in both stomachs
along with this

Mike holds up an evidence bag with a HANDCUFF KEY inside
still attached to part of a dog collar Farmer removes the
key and unlocks the cuff from the female victims hands

(Quick flash Victim reaching for the key around the smaller
dogs collar The sounds of the vicious dogs growling spook

the small dog and cause it to bark The victim jumps back in
tears)

MIKE (CONTD)
Now you know why Ive always been
more of a cat person
(laughs at his own joke)
Still waiting on those dental
records for a positive ID on our
victim Hopefully by tomorrow

Farmer still holding the dog collar takes a quick look at
the tag CLOSE SHOT on the tag reveals it has an address
“5533 West Falls Dr”

MIKE (CONTD)
Approximate time of death was

between eight thirty and ten last
night

FARMER
Thanks Mike

Farmer heads for the door
INT SLOAN RESIDENCE (5533 WEST FALLS DR) - LATER

Farmer sits on the couch opposite MR and MRS TERRY SLOAN a
warm and loving elderly couple

They both appear pretty distraught as Farmer carefully hands
the plastic bag containing the dog collar to Mr Sloan

MRS SLOAN
We havent seen Mooch for a few
days We just assumed he ran away

FARMER
Im terribly sorry Mr and Mrs
Sloan
(beat)
Is there anyone maybe one of your
neighbors that you can think of
that would want to harm your dog

MR SLOAN
Everyone in the neighborhood loved
him

MRS SLOAN

Can we see him
Farmer goes to speak but doesnt know how to start

MRS SLOAN (CONTD)
I just want to give him a proper
burial He was like one of the
family

FARMER
Im sorry Thats not going to be
possible Mrs Sloan

MRS SLOAN
Oh God

Mr Sloan stands up and puts his hand on his wife shoulder

MR SLOAN
Why dont you get Detective Farmer
something to drink

MRS SLOAN
(momentarily distracted)
Oh Im terribly sorry Can I get
you anything

FARMER
Im fine
(reconsidering his answer)
Or maybe just a glass of water

Mrs Sloan exits the room as Mr Sloan lovingly watches her
leave Once she’s gone he slowly makes his way over to the
window

MR SLOAN
Im sorry Detective Farmer my
wife shes been through a lot in
the last few years

FARMER
I understand

Farmer makes his way toward Mr Sloan then notices a table
covered with family pictures He slowly picks one of them
up

MR SLOAN
I wish we could be of more help
but

Farmer abruptly puts the picture down and heads toward the
door

FARMER
Im sorry I have to go

Mrs Sloan reenters the room just as Farmer reaches for the
door

MRS SLOAN
Detective Farmer

FARMER
(hurried)
I need to get going Thank you for
your help

The Sloans stand at the front door confused as they watch
Farmer leave

EXT PIPER’S HOME - LATER

Farmer walks up to the front door and rings the doorbell
TRINA PIPER 40’s youthful for her age answers the door

She takes one look at Farmer and tries to slam the door shut
Farmer manages to stick his foot in the doorway to keep it
open

TRINA
Leave Farmer We don’t want
anything to do with you

FARMER
Please Trina I need to speak with
him
(beat)
It’s important

TRINA
We haven’t heard a word from you in
five years
(beat)
You could have at least called

FARMER
I knowI’mI’m sorry
(beat)
I have to see him

TRINA
(hesitant to answer)
He’s not even here

Once again she tries to slam the door Farmer forcefully
keeps it open

FARMER
Trina please

TRINA
He only goes to two places He’s
either with the young man he
tutors
(fighting back tears)
(MORE )

TRINA (contd)
Our own kids can’t stand to look at
him

For a third time she tries unsuccessfully to close the door

FARMER
And the other place

TRINA
(somberly )
The hospital He’s probably at the
hospital

FARMER
Thank you Trina sorry to have

Trina doesn’t give Farmer a chance to finish She slams the
door in his face

FARMER (CONTD)
(to himself)
-disturbed you

INT HOSPITAL BURN UNIT - LATER

Farmer approaches a heavy set NURSE filling out paper work at
the reception desk

FARMER
(flashing his badge)
I was wondering if

NURSE
Are you here about the missing
patient

FARMER

Uh no I’m looking for a friend of
mine Charlie Piper

(beat)
You have a patient missing

NURSE
Oh yeah real sick guy too Just
disappeared yesterday Cops have
been in and out of here all day
questioning everybody

The nurse types the name into the computer as she talks

NURSE (CONTD)
Lets seePiper Charlie He

hasn’t been in this week
(MORE )

NURSE (CONTD)
Or last week come to think of it
That’s pretty unusual for him

Farmer hands the nurse his card

FARMER
If you happen to see him will you
give me a call

NURSE
Sure

On the way out Farmer passes a uniformed officer taking a
statement from a nurse

EXT CITY STREET - MORNING

Farmer carrying his morning coffee makes his way under
yellow crime scene tape He’s immediately overwhelmed by a
crowd of officers and crime scene investigators

He brushes by the crowd to Sam standing near an open sewer
manhole

SAM
Morning Farmer

FARMER
Sam Sam how many times do I have
to tell you no murders before
seven am

Sam barely cracks a smile hes not his usual humorous self
this morning

SAM
(nervy)
Yeah okay Its down and to your
right

FARMER
(almost afraid to ask)
Youre not coming down

SAM
No way Im not going back down
there

Farmer makes his way down the manhole a little nervous as to
what he is about to see

INT SEWER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

He reaches the bottom of the ladder and is greeted by a
series of disgusted faces standing a few yards away from a
corpse

FARMER
Fellas do we plan on gathering
evidence today or are we all on

break

BENNY
Were waiting for them to clear out
a little

FARMER

Waiting for what to clear out

Benny shines his flashlight onto the corridor walls straight
ahead The wall appears to be moving Farmer takes a few
steps closer and raises his light

We now see the walls are covered with SPIDERS of all sizes
and colors

(Quick flash Scene of victims screaming face as a large
quantity of spiders begins to cover his flesh)

BENNY
Weve got pest control on the way
Ive already seen a couple black
widows Who knows how many of those
other fuckers are poisonous

Farmer shines his light on another wall to reveal the victim
His flesh is swollen purple in color with enlarged veins
and bright red welts everywhere

The carefully arranged ropes making up a man made SPIDER
WEB dangle the motionless victim upside down like a helpless
fly

FARMER
Someone has way too much time on
their hands

Farmer gets closer and sees the body is still covered with
hundreds of spiders A large barrel lies on its side at the
base of the wall below the victim

BENNY
City workers found him just as you
see him

(Quick flash The victim not covered in spiders desperately
tries to free himself from the chain around his ankle)

Farmer shines his light on the walls around the body
revealing a hole overflowing with spiders inches away from
the victim

BENNY (CONTD)
What have we got

Benny reluctantly gets closer to the hole There’s thousands
of spiders crawling in and around the hole

BENNY (CONTD)
They look like your everyday garden-
variety daddy long legs

FARMER
Harmless

BENNY
As a fly
(beat)
The hole is within his reach

Farmer shines his flashlight directly into the hole The
light reflects off of a metal object deep within the opening

(Quick flash The victim reaches toward the hole but cant do
it He shakes his head no as he cries uncontrollably)

FARMER
(hands Benny his coffee)
Hold this for me

Farmer takes a deep breath and then slowly starts to put his
hand into the hole

BENNY
(loud abruptly)
Are you out of your fucking mind

Farmer quickly jumps back

FARMER
Dont do that

Farmer takes another look and then quickly slams his hand
into the hole We stay close on Farmer as he pushes his arm
further and further into the hole

BENNY
Did you find anything

Farmers now up to his shoulder in the hole Several of the
spiders have crawled up his arm and are getting eerily close
to his face

FARMER
Yeah I found something but this
feels so good that I dont want to
pull my arm out asshole

One of the spiders inches closer to Farmers mouth just as he
yanks his arm out Farmer now covered with spiders opens
his hand to reveal a KEY

He quickly brushes the spiders off his arm and takes a
closer look at the key It looks exactly the same as the key
found on the dog collar

Farmer shines the flashlight around some more This time his
light falls on a tripod surrounded by a white powder

FARMER (CONTD)
Whats that

BENNY
A video camera tripod

Farmer throws him a ridiculous glance before pointing at the
powder

BENNY (CONTD)
Oh that well well have to run
some tests butmy guess is that
its some kind of poison or bug
repellent

FARMER
To keep them off of him while he
watches

(Quick flash Victim continues to cry and shake his head
NO Suddenly a shadowy figure moves toward him kicks
over the barrel and then backs away)

BENNY
You think were dealing with the
same guy

FARMER

Lets get this guy to Mike
Hopefully we can get a quick ID

OFFICER
His name is Scott Barns

On Farmers surprised lookBenny hands a wallet to Farmer
Farmer quickly rifles through the usual credit cards
assorted family photos and business cards

Suddenly one of the business cards catches his eye CLOSE
SHOT business card reads DR JENNIFER WALKER

INT MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE - LATER

Farmer and Embry stand beside the bodies of the dog attack
and the Spider victim Embry is just finishing up with the
spider victims autopsy as they talk

EMBRY
Hung up like a fly huh

Farmer nods

EMBRY (CONTD)
These wackos get more and more
creative

FARMER
Anything useful you can tell me
about spider man here

(Quick flash The barrel is kicked over and thousands of
spiders quickly make their way up the screaming victims body)

EMBRY
He was bitten over two thousand
times and had a half-cup of venom
in his system

(Quick flash We follow a spider as it crawls along the skin
then it bites We continue up the skin to see spider after
spider biting into the flesh)

EMBRY (CONTD)
Enough to kill a rino

FARMER
Any idea on the species of spider

EMBRY
Not my area of expertise but I can
tell you that he died of a heart
attack

FARMER
Caused by the venom

EMBRY
It’s possiblebut my guess is it

was more out of shock

(beat)
(MORE )

EMBRY (contd)
As best as I can tell time of
death was between midnight and two
am this morning

FARMER
If this is the same guy he had a
busy night

EMBRY
(referring to the dog
victim)
We just got back your dental
records on Ms Puppy chow here

Farmer stares at Mike in disbelief

EMBRY (CONTD)
What Shes dead shes doesnt
mind

FARMER
Just give me her name

EMBRY
Amy Larson

The name rings of recognition in Farmers face as we

CUT TO

INT POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

Farmer walks into the room and immediately tosses a pad of
paper in front of a tearful Jennifer He nods to the guard
standing watch at the door who nods back and leaves the
room

JENNIFER
(an emotional wreck)

FARMER

We see Sam and Benny standing on the other side of the glass
looking in on Jennifer After a beat Farmer walks into the
room

FARMER

Farmer looks in at Jennifer as Benny and Sam leave the room
As soon as they’re gone he takes a deep breath shuts off the

audiovideo feed from the interrogation room and then
leaves

We PULL FORWARD to

Jennifer sits nervously as Farmer reenters and takes a seat

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

We see DONALD PARKS early 40s dressed in business attire
as he pauses on the staircase landing of the top level of the
garage

He’s winded and covered in sweat He takes off his glasses
to wipe his face when he hearsfootsteps in front of him
He quickly puts his glasses on but the footsteps go quiet

He scans the garage in front of him Its quiet dimly lit
and aside from a few cars mostly empty

Donald proceeds to walk toward the cars Hes barely taken
his second step when a loud DING rips through the silence and
causes him to jump Donald quickly whirls around to find the
elevator door slowly opening behind him He stands frozen
as MARK a co-worker exits and brushes by him with a little
pat on the back

As soon as Mark drives away Donald starts toward his own
car Once again he hears the footsteps This time Donnie
doesnt stop

Quickly his brisk walk turns into an all out sprint He
reaches his car and struggles to retrieve his car keys from
his pocket

The footsteps continue and grow louder as they get closer
They seem to be directly behind him when he pulls the keys
from his pocket Donald quickly turns around

DONALD
Who’s there

The footsteps have grown silent He does his best to scan the
area Everything appears to be still and quiet

Donald unlocks the car door and quickly climbs inside
INT DONALDS CAR - CONTINUOUS

He jumps behind the wheel and immediately locks the door
behind him He scans the garage but sees nothing

DONALD
No more fucking horror movies I
cant take this shit

Satisfied he puts the key in the ignition Suddenly a
pair of hands SLAM on the drivers side window

DONALD (CONTD)
Fuck

Donald nearly jumps out of his skin On the outside of the
car we see JERRY another co-worker laughing hysterically

Jerry knocks on the window and motions for him to roll it
down Donald replies with his middle finger Jerry holds up
a file with a grin Reluctantly Donald rolls the window
down

DONALD (CONTD)
You are such a piece of shit
Jerry

JERRY
I know But youre just so fucking
easy to scare You should really
see someone about that

Jerry hands him the file

JERRY (CONTD)
Youll need this for your stats

Jerry heads toward his car having a laugh at Donald’s
expense Donald watches him drive away and sends him off
with another middle finger

As soon as he leaves Donald turns his attention to the file
on his lap He flips through a few pages before closing the
file and placing it on the seat next to him

With a sigh of relief he turns the ignition He is greeted
with deafening music He shuts the music off and goes to put
his seat belt on whena PLASTIC BAG is thrown over his
head

He struggles with the person in the back seat but is quickly
overpowered As Donald quickly loses consciousness we

FADE TO BLACK
INT POLICE CHIEFS OFFICE - LATER

CHIEF BRIAN KINGSLEY 50S a large burly man with a fiery
temper to match his intimidating stature is quickly losing
his patience

The files and crime scene photos lay sprawled across his desk
as Farmer and Benny look like they want to kill one another

BENNY
He’s jeopardizing the whole
investigation

FARMER
Why is this brown nosing asshole
even in here

BENNY
Chief he knows hershe called
him Sean andand he was holding
her fucking hand How many more
people have to die before you pull
the plug on this drunk

Farmer stands up with Benny quickly following his lead The
two stand face to face

KINSLEY
Enough
(beat)
Farmer sit the fuck down

Farmer does as he’s told

KINSLEY (CONTD)
Benny get out of here

BENNY

KINSLEY
Get your ass out of here

Benny reluctantly leaves

FARMER
Thank you

KINSLEY
Don’t thank me yet
(beat)
You know you’re one screw up away
from losing it all Farmer I
can’t keep justifying your erratic
behavior to the brass anymore

FARMER
Then don’t

KINSLEY
You can’t cash in on your heroics
from five years ago anymore
(beat)
Have you taken a look at yourself
lately

Farmer just turns his head and stares out the window

KINSLEY (CONTD)
You look like shit

FARMER
Thanks

KINSLEY
Yeah now you can thank me
(beat)
How do you know her

Farmer doesn’t answer He just gets up takes his badge and
gun and places them on the desk

FARMER
Ill go tell Benny the good news

Farmer turns to leave The chief slams his fists on the desk
causing Farmer to stop cold in his tracks
KINSLEY
Youre going to let that piece of
shit get the best of you Get your
ass back here and be a fucking
man

Farmer stands frozen

Before Farmer can respond there’s a knock on the door

KINSLEY (CONT’D)
How do you know her

FARMER
She’s my therapist She’s been
treating me for phyrophobia

KINSLEY
For what

FARMER
It’s a fear ofever since that
day I can’tits fire

KINSLEY
I can’t have your personal
relationships clouding your
judgement

FARMER
They wont

KINSLEY
Youre too close to our only
suspect I’m reassigning you

both look up to see Sam standing in the doorway

Sam walks into the office and hands the chief a piece of

paper

Sam leaves as quickly as he can but not before noticing
Farmer’s gun and badge Farmer quickly retrieves them from

the desk

SAM
Bad time

KINSLEY
What is it

SAM

KINGSLEY

Okay let’s talk
(beat)

You think the two murders are
related

FARMER
They were both patients of Dr
Walker and case studies in her
book Both victims were also
handcuffed in the same manner

KINGSLEY
Well you better be damn sure
Farmer
(beat)
The last thing we need is for the
words serial killer to be
mentioned The phones will be
ringing off the hook from people
who think their gardener or the guy
who bagged their groceries looked
at them funny

Farmer hands Kingsley Jennifers BOOK

FARMER
You can pick it up in any bookstore
across the country

Kingsley examines the book and flips through the pages

FARMER (CONTD)
Id like a warrant and some more
men to look over Dr Walkers
files If he is targeting the
people in this book I’d like to get
to them first

KINGSLEY
Ill talk to Judge Alvarez Youll

have your warrant within the hour
(beat)

Farmer its your case to lose
Youll have your extra manpower

KINGSLEY (contd)

fucking idiot

INT BOX - LATER
TOTAL DARKNESS --

The subtle sounds of someone stirring are quickly over taken
by frantic breathing

DONALD
(screaming)
Someone help me

Hes alone with the darkness

DONALD (CONTD)
Get me the fuck out of here

Hes starting to hyperventilate when we hear the sounds of a
match lighting followed by the flame It throws just enough
light for us to see Donald terrified locked in a box just
large enough for him

The match goes out and again were left in the dark with the
heavy sounds of Donald gasping for air

VOICE (0C)
(unnervingly calm)
Calm down Donald

The voice is menacingly cold and more than capable of sending
shivers up the toughest guys spine

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
You only have two matches left

DONALD
(barely audible)
Getgetme out of here

VOICE (0C)
I cant do that

Donald begins screaming as he lights another match

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
Calm down and listen

Donald continues to hyperventilate He musters up what
little strength he has left and starts to smash his fists on
the roof of the box

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
Youre being foolish Donald You
wont be able to break through the
solid oak paneling

Donald either doesnt care or isnt listening He starts to
scrape and claw at the roof as the match goes out once again

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
Youre claustrophobic right

Donald doesnt answer as he continues to struggle to breath

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)

Theres more than enough air in
this box for you to last over half
and hour When the time is up you
will hear an alarm go off and you
will be free to open the box

(beat)
At that time and that time only
you can pull the lever at the base
of the box by your feet and the box
will open

Donald lights the last match and frantically starts to reach
around at his feet for the release lever The match starts to
burn dangerously close to his fingers

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
If you pull it before the alarm
goes off you will die

Donalds fingers are burning as he locates the lever

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
You will die Donald

Donald pulls the lever and as promised the roof of the box
slides off
WATER FLOODS INTO THE BOX

It quickly overwhelms Donald He starts to frantically kick
his legs and arms as he starts to swim toward the surface

EXT WATER - CONTINUOUS

The box quickly sinks to the bottom as Donald swims upwards
The painful look on his face is more than enough for us to
know hes running out of air

EXT WATERS SURFACE - CONTINUOUS

Were on top of the water looking down In the murky water
we see Donalds silhouette quickly approaching the surface
Hes only a few inches away now

Then his hands burst from the water His arms start to
frantically flail back and forth The sounds of a TRAIN fill
the air

INT WATER - CONTINUOUS

Donald looks up to see a figure above the water looking down
at him The wavy dark waters disguise the mans identity

Donald turns his attention down to his leg Its securely
chained preventing him from reaching the surface for a
breath He struggles for a moment but quickly goes weak

He returns his attention to the man on the waters surface
he figure just stands and watches as Donald starts to lose
his struggle for survival

His arms go limp and surrender to the water as the sounds of
the train can barely be heard now

NT TACTICAL ROOM - LATER

Farmer Jennifer Benny and a dozen or so uniformed officers
fill the buzzing room
The team is made up of officers pouring over the
files manning the phones

several computers

Farmer stands staring at a large grid map thats

patient’s

scouring for information on

pinned to

the wall being used to cross-reference the patients and
their last know addresses

There are already several thumb tacks pinned to t

one of the officers on the computer shouts out

Suddenly

COMPUTER OFFICER
We have another address

Sam bursts into the room

COMPUTER OFFICER (CONTD)

Farmer)

SAM
Youd be wasting your time with

EXT TRAIN BRIDGE (WATERS EDGE) - LATER

he grid when

Farmer and Jennifer now stand with Sam and Benny at the
waters edge in front of a large train bridge
uniformed officers keep reporters and other onlookers at bay

Sam looks

FARMER
What are we looking at

at his watch

SAM
Just another ten seconds and youll

see Farmer
(beat)

Youre so impatient

A group of

FARMER
Im sorry I didnt realize I had
to make an appointment to see my
dead bodies

At ten seconds on the dot a large horn sounds and the bridge
starts to elevate from the water

SAM
The bridge is usually up for the
boats to pass but its down three
times a day for half an hour for
the scheduled trains to pass over

FARMER
Great now I can plan my vacation
time accordingly if its by boat or
train What about my body Sam

SAM
See the chain

We follow Farmers glance to a chain attached to the end of
the bridge closet to them The crowd of onlookers start to
buzz behind them

FARMER
(screaming at the
officers)
Get them out of here

Much to the onlookers dismay the officers do as they are
told

The bridge is more than half way up and a good portion of the
chain is exposed The top of the box that once held Donald
starts to surface from the murky waters

Then slowly we see Donalds lifeless bloated body immerge
from the water The body still attached to the chain by his
ankle dangles helplessly from the box

Jennifer immediately tucks her face into Farmers shoulder
Farmers seen more than enough

JENNIFER
Its him

FARMER
(to Jennifer)
You shouldn’t be here Go wait in
the car

JENNIFER
No I’mI’m fine

FARMER
(to the officers)

All right get him down from there

Sam hands Farmer a KEY

SAM
It was dangling from the bridge
just a few feet above the water
line If he had waited for the
bridge to rise it would have pulled
him out

Farmer looks at the key its the same as the other two

FARMER
(to himself)
Overcome your phobia and live or
give in to the fear and die

INT DARK ROOM - LATER

We hear the heavy breathing of a man as he just wakes up The
room is pitch black

MANS VOICE
Hello Is anybody there

A dim light snaps on directly above our victim We can now
see it’s STEVEN DOOLEY 30’S a thin man dressed in all
white

Steven takes in his surroundings and notices and old rusty
tub and shower off in the corner of the room Suddenly a
familiar voice echoes through the room

VOICE (0C)
Hello Steven

STEVEN
(frightened)
Who are you Where am I

VOICE (0C)
Steven you have bigger things to
worry about

STEVEN
(hesitant to lean the
answer)
Like what

VOICE (OC)
Like making a good first impression
with your new roommate

Just then the main lights turn on revealing Steven isnt the
only person in the room

There lying in the corner of the room is the missing
hospital patient JOSEPH early 40s He is pale and covered
with hideous infected sores

VOICE (OC)
Meet Joseph Im sure you two will
have much to talk about what with
Joseph suffering from a terminal
disease and you being germaphobic
and all

STEVEN
Oh my God Please let me out I
can feel the germs on me

Steven begins to panic He covers his mouth with his hand and
starts pounding on the door

VOICE
Calm down Steven Ill tell you the
way out
Steven stops banging on the door

distraught

VOICE (OC)

44

but is still visibly

All you have to do is put the key

in the hole and open the door

STEVEN
(ready to jump out of his
skin)
Where is the key

VOICE (0C)
I believe our friend Joseph is
keeping it safe for us

Steven turns to Joseph and sees the key wrapped around his

neck

Joseph very sick and highly medicated

unaware of what is happening around him
only to vomit all over himself and the key

come to

STEVEN
I can’t breath The germs

VOICE (0C)
(sternly)

He slowly starts to

I can’t Let me out I need to get

STEVEN

VOICE (0C)
FINE
(beat)
Clean yourself off

Now

Just to the left of Steven the old iron bathtub and shower
start right up The room echoes with the sound of running
water and begins to fill with steam

STEVEN
Thank you Thank you

Steven sticks his hand in the running water

STEVEN (CONTD)
HOLY SHIT

The water gives Steven an instant burn and blisters right
up

VOICE (OC)
Im sorry Steven Im afraid that
shower only heats up to over a
hundred degrees

Joseph is slowly becoming semi-aware of his new surroundings
He notices Steven in the room

JOSEPH
Heyhey manwhat

Joseph tries desperately to get up but is too weak he
reaches out for Steven

STEVEN
NO Stay away from me Please I
dont want to get sick

Joseph manages to move forward an inch or two and then
vomits again Steven now scared shitless jumps right in the
hot shower to avoid contact with Joseph

Steven screams in agony Even as he slowly burns himself to
death he can’t take his eyes off of Joseph

CUT TO
INT FARMERS CAR - NIGHT

Farmer and Jennifer sit in his car outside her apartment
They both stare straight ahead

After a beat Farmer looks up and notices the dormant look on
Jennifers face He slowly finds his tongue

FARMER
Theres nothing more you could have
done for him Jen

She opens the car door and steps on to the curb

JENNIFER
Thats whats bothering me

She closes the door leaving Farmer alone He waits fora
moment and then starts the car up Hes about to pull away
when she knocks on the drivers side window

JENNIFER (CONTD)
I dont want to be alone tonight

FARMER

She doesnt give Farmer a chance to finish She leans in and
kisses him He doesnt hesitate to kiss her back

JENNIFER
Come by later

She walks off leaving Farmer speechless
INT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

A MAN 30S a thin and frail bookworm sits in his office
cubical with his head buried in his work His nose is red
and he occasionally sneezes the results of a lingering cold

We pull up to reveal his cubical is in the middle of a large
room of thirty or so others that are quiet and empty Its
after business hours and hes burning the midnight oil

A small desk lamp along with the light from his computer
monitor throws just enough light to work

Suddenly the phone rings breaking the silence and causing
him to jump He wipes his nose with a tissue and answers the
call His voice is tired and nasally

MAN

(into the phone)

Farmer finally turns to face his superior

KINGSLEY (CONTD)

One of the officers on the phone jumps up out of his chair

PHONE OFFICER

INT ELEVATOR - LATER

Our bookworm steps into the elevator and pushes the button
for the parking garage He starts to adjust his tie as the
elevator makes its descent

Suddenly the lights flicker and then go out completely The
elevator comes to a complete stop and hes left in the dark

MAN
Shit

After a beat the emergency lights come on at the base of the
elevator He quickly picks up the emergency phone

MAN (CONTD)
Hello Is anyone there Im stuck
in the elevator

There’s no response He slams the phone down out of
frustration and starts to bang on the elevator doors

MAN (CONTD)
Can anyone hear me

He stops to listen but its completely quiet He pulls a
cell phone from his pocket CLOSE SHOT PHONE reveals its
searching for service

MAN (CONTD)
Piece of shit

He puts the phone back in his pocket and sinks to the ground
in defeat Almost immediately a beam of light from outside
the elevator falls on his face He quickly stands up

MAN (CONTD)
Hello Im stuck in the elevator

The light shuts off

MAN (CONTD)
No I need some help here

He puts his ear to the elevator to listen but hears nothing
He starts to bang on the door again

EXT CITY STREETS - LATER

We see Farmers car red lights flashing and siren blaring
speeding down the city streets The car flies through a red
light and nearly crashes into two oncoming cars

INT ELEVATOR - LATER

Were back inside the elevator He runs his fingers along
the door He positions them in between the doors and tries to
pry it open Almost to his surpriseit opens slightly and
we see that the elevator is stuck just below a floor Once
again he sees the light It appears to be from a flashlight

MAN
Hello

He continues to struggle to pry the doors open Little by
little the heavy doors open and soon the space is wide enough
for him squeeze through The light disappears again

He starts to make his way out of the elevator Its a tight
fit but hes almost through when hes sees the light coming
from around the corner

MAN (CONTD)
Hello

The light is getting closer as his leg gets caught He turns
around and with very little effort manages to pry it free

MAN (CONTD)
(as he turns back around)
I could use a little help over

The light is gone

MAN (CONTD)
(under his breath)
Lousy rent-a-cop

He quickly makes his way toward the staircase around the
corner

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Farmers car comes to a screeching halt next to several
police cruisers parked in front of a large office building

He quickly jumps out of the car and approaches the uniformed
officers standing outside the main entrance

INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

The stairs are pitch black forcing our bookworm to take a
second for his eyes to adjust He grabs a hold of the
railing and slowly makes his way down He stops at the sound
of a door being opened a few flights below him

MAN
Hello

Theres no answer only footsteps Slowly methodically
making their way up towards him

MAN (CONTD)
Whoswho’s there

The steps continue again without an answer Then they stop
He peers over the staircase ledge but sees nothing

He slowly starts to continue down the stairs when the steps
start up again This time theyre heading away from him He
leans over the edge and screams at the top of his lungs

MAN (CONTD)
Hello Whos down there

The footsteps continue followed by the sounds of a door
opening and then closing

The stairs are once again quiet He hesitates for a beat and
then starts to frantically run down the stairs

After several flights he reaches the bottom level He
quickly reaches for the door to findits locked

INT HALLWAY - LATER

Farmer followed by the uniforms slowly makes his way down
the dark hallway With his gun drawn he reaches for a door
handle

INT STAIRWELL - LATER
The bookworm stands frozen not sure what to do

MAN
Shit

He looks back up the stairwell and listens Everything is
quiet He makes his way back up to the next level and tries
the door Once again a locked door greets him

He goes up to the lobby level and reaches for the door
handle Suddenly the door opens to reveal A SECURITY
GUARD slowly staggering toward him

MAN (CONTD)
Shit you scared me What the hell
is wrong with the lights

The guard gets closer to reveal he is holding his throat as

BLOOD pours through his fingers The guard stumbles on top
of him

MAN (CONTD)
Fuck

The man struggles to push the guard’s limp body off of him

Suddenly a pair of hands appear from nowhere and inject a
syringe into his neck

Now holding his punctured neck he stumbles through the lobby
door

INT LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

He makes it into the lobby area in a hurry The lights from
the street are a refreshing adjustment to the dimly lit
stairs

The man now covered in the security guard’s blood quickly
makes his way to the lobby desk in front of the elevators
just a few feet away

A SECURITY GUARD sits staring at the monitors with his back
to the man

MAN
Help me please

The guard doesnt move
INT OFFICE SPACE - LATER

Farmer bursts into the office to find Jonathan Barrow
frantically trying to shred documents He nearly has a heart
attack at the sight of the police and their guns

FARMER

JONATHAN

Jonathan awkwardly smiles as the shredder spits out one last
piece of diced paper

FARMER
We need you to come with us right

INT LOBBY - LATER
The guard still remains motionless as he approaches the desk

looks tired warn down physically and emotionally a mess
He just stands in the doorway staring at her

JENNIFER
Sean

He doesnt move

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Aren’t you going to come in

He slowly makes his way inside never taking his eyes off of
hers never saying a word

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Are you okay

He nods now standing face to face with her She returns his
gaze not really understanding but sympathetic just the
same

FARMER
Everyone is safe We’ve got
everyone in your book where he
can’t get to them

He leans in slowly toward her lips Jennifer freezes not
sure if this is what she really wants He starts out to kiss
her lips and then stops short

Farmer brushes his cheek across hers He gently kisses her
cheek as she closes her eyes

JENNIFER
(softly in his ear)
Youre going to need to find a new
therapist

As he puts his arms around her she turns and kisses him It
starts out soft but quickly builds Soon they are ripping
each others clothes off as they make their way toward the
bedroom

EXT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE PROPERTY - DUSK

We hear the screams of two black children playing chasing
each other around the warehouse Both children make their way
to the warehouse door

It takes the strength of both kids to pull open the huge
door before they step inside only to be horrified by what
they find

We see a quick shot of a dead body lying in a bathtub Both
kids run out screaming

INT ABANDON STOREROOM - LATER

As our bookworm NATHAN WINTERS (not Jonathan Barrow) starts
to come to the darkness gives way to dim light

He rubs his eyes and slowly he regains his focus He looks
around at his unfamiliar surroundings and immediately starts
to panic

The place is large desolate and dingy Heavy locks secure
the door and thick bars prevent any possible escape through
the two tiny windows near the top of the room To top it
off hes shackled around his ankle

He quickly turns his attention to the NEEDLE PUNCTURE on his
neck CLOSE SHOT Nathans neck reveals the injection has
caused severe swelling and discoloring

Hes in trouble and he knows it
INT JENNIFERS BEDROOM - LATER

INT ABANDONED STOREROOM - LATER

Nathan buries his face in his hands as he starts to sob
Then we hear it

VOICE (0C)
Youre not giving up already are

The voice has more than gotten his attention His eyes dart
from corner to corner of the large storeroom

After a beat Nathan manages to pinpoint the location of the
voice a small speaker positioned next to a camera up by the
ceiling

NATHAN
What do you want with me

The red light on the camera stares back at Nathan as he
struggle with his shackles

VOICE (0C)
You dont have time for that
(beat)
Youve been injected with enough
rattlesnake venom to kill a small
horse Nathan

Nathan looks helplessly at the chain around his leg

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
But Ive been kind enough to
provide you with the anti-venom

NATHAN
Where is it Give it to me

VOICE (0C)
Its in the very room youre
standing in

Nathan starts to hobble around the room desperately looking
for the anti-venom

The room is virtually barren except for the far wall Nathan
quickly makes his way over to a FIRST AID KIT

He opens the kit and immediately stumbles backwards

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
You have no choice

NATHAN
II cant do it

VOICE (0C)

die Nathan

NATHAN

Nathan starts to grow pale

NATHAN

Hes starting to sweat profusely and suddenly turns and
starts to violently vomit

VOICE (OC)
You need to hurry

Nathan slowly makes his way over to the first aid kit He
pulls out a large bag of syringe needles and nearly drops
them on the floor

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
Careful If you break them I will
not be able to get you more anti-
venom in time

He holds his hand up to reveal it is shaking uncontrollably

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
Its the effects of the venom on
your nervous system

NATHAN
Which needle has the anti-venom

VOICE (0C)

Nathan starts to sob again

One of them has the anti-venom the
others are harmless

Nathan once again starts desperately trying to pull his ankle
free from the shackle He is unsuccessful and eventually he
exhausts himself

VOICE (OC) (CONTD)
I wouldnt waste what little energy
you have left

He slowly opens the bag and spills the fifteen needles on the

floor He picks up the closest needle and lifts it to his
arm His nerves are shot and he can barley keep his hand
steady

He pulls the needle back and prepares to plunge it into his

arm His hand shakes uncontrollably as he brings the needle
down hard

INT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER

Farmer along with others examine the corpse of the now
unrecognizable Steven The smell of death is overwhelming

noses

We pan down to see the remains of Steven His skin is
blackened and blistered from head to tow

Some of his skin around his chest was completely burned off
his rib bones are exposed

BENNY
Couple of kids playing near here

Farmer takes a few steps closer and bends down to one knee
next to the body resting by his feet He stares Steven in the
eyes for what seems like forever

Sam approaches Farmer and the body reading a file

SAM
(referring to the file)
Farmer you need to take a look at

overlap in the times of two of the

with Benny He just turns and walks away

SAM
(holding up the file)
Farmer you really need to take a
look at this

Farmer continues to walk away

BENNY

Benny and Sam can only watch as Farmer is beginning to lose
all hope of ever stopping this madman Sam’s cell phone
begins to ring he’s quick to answer

INT ABANDONED STOREROOM - LATER

Nathan sits on the ground completely shell shocked Most of
his body including his face is disgusting swollen

Over half of the needles have already been used and thrown to
the side as he desperately tries to find the vein for the
next needle

After a few unsuccessful tries he hits the vein and empties
the needle CLOSE SHOT Nathans eyes as his pupils instant

INT NELSON SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER

Farmer quickly makes his way inside through the loading dock
Wary of his surroundings he makes his way down the hall and
sees the freezer

Police sirens can heard in the background as he runs to the
window and peers inside Susan is crouched on the floor with
her arms wrapped around herself for warmth

Farmer beats on the window trying to get Susans attention
She slowly raises her head and looks at him Her eyes are
starting to freeze over

FARMER
(almost in panic)
NO Fuck

Farmer pulls on the door with every ounce of strength he has
It doesnt budge He looks back through the window and sees
Susans icy breath rapidly decreasing

FARMER (CONTD)

Farmer backs up and shoots the door handle twice Both shots
ricochet off the solid metal door and hit the wall

out

Farmer now on the slanted roof top scans his surrounding
for his suspect Suddenlythe figure jumps on him from
behind

The suspect repeatedly slams Farmers head hard into the roof
As Farmer struggles to remain conscious both men start to
slide down towards the edge of the building

Both bodies now hang over the edge of the structure Farmer’s
gun falls 50 feet to the ground below

The suspect manages to pull himself up and get his footing
first He jumps to the next building Farmer takes a minute
to pull himself up over the ledge Without hesitation he
jumps to the next building in pursuit of the killer

Farmer reaches the end of the building and notices a ladder
leading to the ground He looks down and sees the suspect
running down an alleyway

He slides down the ladder making up valuable ground He
reaches the alley and continues the pursuit

Farmer now within feet of the suspect races through the
alley Several homeless men warming themselves by a burning
barrel block the way The suspect runs over one homeless man
and knocks the barrel over catching the boxes and other

flammable debris on fire

A flame small enough to easily jump over now separates
Farmer from his suspect Farmer seeing the fire instantly
becomes wide-eyed with fear

He starts to slowly hyperventilate The sounds of his

HEARTBEAT accelerating becomes overwhelming and drowns out
all surrounding sound

His eyes are fixated on the miniature inferno as he slowly
backs out of the alley as the suspect makes his escape

Just then Benny pulls up in a squad car

BENNY

INT FARMERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Farmer paces back and forth with half a bottle of Jack
Daniels in his hand The case files lie sprawled out on the
bed amongst his overwhelming mess

He raises the bottle to his lips then abruptly stops Farmer
takes a good look at the mess he calls home He takes a look
in the mirror and sees himself with the bottle

He slowly makes his way over to the window opens it and
pours what’s left of the bottle outside He closes the
window and makes his way over to his bed

Farmer pushes some of the papers to the side lies down and
reaches over and shuts the light off Almost immediately
the sounds of his slowed and heavy breathing fill the dimly
lit room

Suddenly there is a noise from the other room Farmers eyes
instantly open He sits still for a bit before the noise is
heard again

He instinctively reaches under the pillow next to him and
pulls out his GUN He slowly sits up and heads for the
bedroom door He peers around the corner and sees

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
someone creeping around in the dark
INT FARMERS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Farmer pulls his head back around the corner and remains
frozen with his back up against the wall The noises from
the other room get closer and then stop

Farmer stands motionless for what seems like an eternity
The anticipation is overwhelming as the shadowed figure
slowly makes its way inside Farmer’s bedroom

Farmer is about to make his move when the figure unexpected
stops and starts to turn back around Farmer nervously
shifts his weight making just enough noise for the intruder
to hear Suddenly the intruder stops He turns his attention
to Farmers bedroom doorway

Unable to wait any longer Farmer springs into action and
tackles the intruder just as they enter the room

FARMER
You fucking piece of shit

Farmer makes his way on top of the intruder and points his
firearm at their face

Jennifer stands slightly behind them doing her best to keep
her composure as Mike explains his findings

MIKE
Security guards are pretty straight
up Died within a few seconds

JENNIFER
He’s getting sloppy Killing the
guardsit doesn’t fit his MO

MIKE
(referring to Nathan’s
body)

Now this poor guy wasn’t so lucky
(beat)

Judging by the angle all the
needles were self-injected

FARMER
More poisons

MIKE
No the poison came from rattle
snake venom injected in his neck
(beat)
The needles were holding everything
from heroin to your basic saline
solution Take a look at this

Mike opens Nathans toes to reveal a needle mark

FARMER
He shot up in between his toes

MIKE
There are multiple track marks
here arms can only take so much
Jennifer steps forward

JENNIFER
How many needles
FARMER
We found fifteen by the body
MIKE
Fifteen needles and fifteen track
marks
FARMER
So he actually used all of the
needles
MIKE

Yeah And by the look of all the
failed attempts he had a hell of a
time doing it

JENNIFER
None of the needles had the anti-
venom

Mike gives a disappointing nod

JENNIFER (CONTD)

He’s taken this to a whole new
level He’s perfected his killings
buthe’s losing control The
murders are getting more and more
frequent

(beat)
Before it was about giving them a

newspaper articles and clippings of Farmer and his heroics

Farmer looks over at the bed and notices there is a large
envelope with his name on it He picks it up

SAM

Farmer pulls out a VIDEOTAPE just as Mr Loan bursts into
the room

MR SLOAN

home

FARMER

Benny will you take Mr Sloan into
the kitchen for questioning

tape into Jason’s VCR

following him We see clips of Farmer coming and going from
his home and the police station

its video footage ofJennifer

similar tapes and files with familiar names on them

Farmer reluctantly pops the tape in and presses play His
eyes go wide with disbelief We spin around from Farmers
face to the television screen

On the screen is the murder of Amy Larson the dog victim
from the killers point of view

SAM
(just as shocked)
What the fuck

Farmer quickly ejects the tape He grabs one from the pile on
the desk and forces it into the VCR This tape is the murder
of Scott Barns the spider victim

SAM (CONTD)
How the hell did Dr Walker get

FARMER
(unconvincing)

to think she’s involved somehow

Sam picks up one of the files and looks it over

Farmer snatches the file from Sams hands He quickly glances
at the pictures

(several gruesome pictures flash by the screen)
He tosses the file back on the desk

(angrily)
Shes not involved

Sam surprised how quickly Farmers mood changed steps back

first
Farmer listens closely to the killers instructions
FARMER

Jenn

The line goes dead

FARMER (CONTD)
Hello Hello Shit

Farmer hangs up the phone

FARMER (CONTD)
Get a tactical team ready and wait
for my call

CUT TO
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

This lonely street on the wrong side of town has become a
home to the lost and the unwanted

The street lights no longer work the sidewalks are covered
in filth and the buildings have severely deteriorated over
the years Everything and everyone on this street has seen
better days

A BURNING red cigarette pierces through the darkness
INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

The owner of the cigarette sits in a parked car across from
the main entrance to a shady hotel After another drag he
exhales and exits the vehicle

EXT CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

The cigarette drops to the ground next to half a dozen other
discarded butts

Completely cloaked by the night’s darkness he slowly makes
his way to the rear of the hotel

INT HALLWAY - LATER

A young UNIFORMED OFFICER stands guard outside one of the
guest rooms Suddenly the lights begin to flicker and then
go out

After a moment of darkness the back up generator kicks in

and the emergency lights come on to barely illuminate the
hallway

The young officer now nervously pacing back and forth
freezes He squints at what looks like someone coming down
the hall towards him

He draws his gun

OFFICER
(nervously)
Dontdont move

The FIGURE at the end of the hall relentlessly continues
toward the officer

OFFICER (CONTD)
Hey asshole I said don’t move

The figure is now close enough for the young officer to get a
clear shot of his face

OFFICER (CONTD)
(with recognition)
You scared the shit out of me

He lowers his firearm Suddenly the figure PUNCHES the
young officer across his face knocking him unconscious

The figure takes the room KEYCARD from the unconscious guard
and enters the guest room

JONATHAN (0C)
Whowho’s there

EXT ROOF TOP - LATER

The figure along with his captive JONATHAN BARROW 40’s a
nerdy looking man bound and gaged burst through the roof
access door

He pushes Jonathan towards the end of the building and for
the first time our figure’s face and identity are revealed

Its detective Farmer

Jonathan tenses up and desperately tries to resist Farmer
all too determined drags him the rest of the way

Now at the edge they reach a poorly constructed extremely
narrow WALKWAY leading to the adjacent building The
howling wind is deafening as Farmer peers to the ground
below At this height a fall would be overwhelmingly
gruesome

Farmer grabs Jonathan and quickly removes the duct tape

JONATHAN
(terrified)
Please let me go I cant be up
this high I have a

FARMER
fear of heights I know

Suddenly a look of recognition creeps across Jonathan’s
face

JONATHAN
Holy shit I know you Youre
working on my case

(beat)
Youre a fucking cop
Farmer gives Jonathan a cold stare

FARMER
Get on the ledge

Jonathan begins to panic

JONATHAN
I can’t I won’t do it

Farmer puts his gun to Jonathans head

FARMER
If you dont do it you will die

JONATHAN
Youre a fucking cop you cant
shoot me

Farmer shows his badge to Jonathan then tosses it off the
edge of the building

FARMER
Nowget on the fucking ledge

JONATHAN
(defiantly)
No

Farmer pulls back the hammer on his gun

FARMER
Dont make me shoot you Jonathan

JONATHAN
(rather smug)

You won’t
Jonathan is now staring down the barrel of Farmer’s gun

BANG

We pull back to reveal the bullet has grazed Jonathan’s ear
He grabs his ear in pain

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Holy Shit You shot me I’m gonna
have your fucking job

Farmer bends down to meet Jonathan face to face

FARMER
Do you really think anyone is going
believe a lying thieving piece of
shit like you

JONATHAN
(almost in tears)
I’m fucking bleeding man

Farmer stands up

FARMER
I’ll talk to the DA and see if
they can work out a plea agreement
with you
(beat)
But you’re going to cross this
building

Farmer grabs Jonathan by the collar lifting him to the edge
of the building He points his gun at Jonathan motioning for
him to get moving Jonathan is crying like a baby as he
slowly climbs the edge

JONATHAN
What if I fall
FARMER
Dont worry no one will miss you

Now move

Jonathan takes a deep breath and makes a mad dash for the
other end The wind howls shaking the rail

He’s within feet of the next building when he looses his
balance and begins to fall forward off of the rail The
sound of Jonathan’s screams drown out as we see the look of
fear in Farmer’s face

We pan around off of Farmer’s face to seeJonathan is
still alive He is hanging to the edge of the next building

FARMER (CONTD)
Jonathan hold on

JONATHAN
(screaming)
Help me Help me
Farmer calls out to Jonathan
FARMER
Jonathan calm down try to pull

yourself up

Jonathan looks down and sees just how high up he is

JONATHAN
(beginning to panic)
Oh my God Help me

FARMER
(yelling to Jonathan)
Swing your body to the left and
pull your leg up

Jonathan does as he is told He begins to sway his weight to
one side trying to reach his leg up

Jonathan finally manages to get his leg up and over on the
ledge He uses every once of strength he has to pull himself
to safety Farmer breathes a sigh of relief

Jonathan rests with his back to the edge of the building
trying to catch his breath

FARMER (CONTD)
Jonathan I need you to look around
and tell me if you see anything

JONATHAN
Fuck you Pig

Farmer fires two rounds into the lege just above Jonathans
head

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Fuck Okay okay

Jonathan finally catches his breath and opens his eyes there
ten feet in front of him is a small gift wrapped package with
Farmers name on it

JONATHAN (CONTD)
There’s aa present over here for
you

FARMER
(relieved)
Open it and tell me what is inside

Jonathan removes the lid and looks inside Its a small cell
phone Suddenlyit begins to ring

JONATHAN
Its a phone Its ringing

FARMER
Answer it

Jonathan puts the phone to his ear

JONATHAN
(into the phone)
Hellhello

A familiar voice answers back to Jonathan

VOICE (0C)

I’m very proud of you Jonathan
(beat)

Tell detective Farmer to go to this

address

CUT TO
EXT CONDEMNED APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
Farmer ducks under the yellow caution tape surrounding the
building entrance making his way to the front door It’s

locked

He punches through the glass pane reaching inside for the
door handle He draws his weapon as the door slowly opens

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The place is pitch black He turns on his flashlight as he
walks through the lobby toward a stairwell

INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

He cautiously makes his way onto the steps He points his gun
and flashlight toward the upper levels The stairwell looks
empty

He starts to run up the stairs finally stopping at the
landing to the fifth floor He takes a deep breath before
kicking the door

INT FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

With his flashlight leading the way Farmer sweeps into the
hallway It’s completely empty as he makes his way down the
hall

He stops in front of room 534 after hearing a muffled sound
escape the room He scans the hall one last time

SuddenlyFarmer kicks in the door
INT ROOM 534 - CONTINUOUS

Farmer enters the dark room to see a FIGURE standing over a
bound and unconscious woman

FARMER
Get the fuck away from her

The figure whirls around as the light from Farmer’s
flashlight falls on his face It’s Jason Phoenix

FARMER (CONT’D)
Put your hands where I can see them
Jason

Jason takes a step toward Farmer

JASON
I was

FARMER
Don’t fucking move

Jason freezes and puts his hands in the air

JASON
I just woke

FARMER
Shut the fuck up

Farmer quickly moves toward the woman The whole time
keeping his gun on Jason

FARMER (CONT’D)
If she’s hurt I’1l

Farmer pushes the gun barrel into Jason’s forehead

JASON
Wait

FARMER
Shut the fuck up

Farmer bends down to start untying Jennifer
FARMER (CONTD)
Jennifer Jennifer can you hear
me

Farmer notices a wedding ring on Jennifer’s hand He lifts
her hair to reveal her face and findsthis is not Jennifer

Farmer backs away and points his gun at Jason

FARMER (CONTD)
(angrily)
Who is that Where’s Jennifer

Jason gives Farmer a strange look

JASON
How should I know I don’t even
know how I got here

FARMER
Dont fuck with me Jason

Jason eyes catch a glimpse of someone behind Farmer Farmer
notices Jason’s reaction and quickly swings around to
finda man in a GAS MASK

The gas masked assailant is using Jennifer as a shield He
holds a gun to her head as Farmer wide-eyed in disbelief

starts to stager backwards

GAS MASK
Drop your gun or she fucking dies

Farmer hesitates but slowly lowers his gun

GAS MASK (CONTD)
Drop it on the ground and kick it
over here

Farmer reluctantly does as hes told He is immediately
rewarded with a bullet to the shoulder Farmer falls to the
ground and grasps the wound

JASON
Shit

The man in the gas mask whirls around pointing his gun at
Jason

JASON (CONTD)
Okay dontdont shoot me

GAS MASK
Shut the fuck up

Jason nods as he sinks to the ground The gas masked man
turns his attention back to the wounded Farmer

GAS MASK (CONTD)
(pointing to the
unconscious woman)
Now get up and take the bottle of
pills out of her shirt pocket

Farmer picks himself up and slowly takes a PRESCRIPTION
BOTTLE of pills out of the unconscious womans shirt pocket

CLOSE SHOT OF BOTTLE reveals the woman’s name is MARY ROTH
but the part of the label revealing the name of the
medication has been peeled off

GAS MASK (CONTD)
Swallow them

Farmer opens the bottle and looks inside Its more than
half full

FARMER
What are they

GAS MASK
I guess youre just going to have
to find out

Farmer hesitates and then reluctantly downs the bottle

GAS MASK (CONTD)
(referring to Jason
Phoenix)

Now tie him up

Farmer picks up a roll of duct tape off the ground He gives
Jason and apologetic look as he starts to bind his wrists and
ankles

GAS MASK (CONTD)
Cover his mouth

He does as hes told as his vision starts to become blurred

GAS MASK (CONTD)
(distorted and slow)
Whats the matter Farmer

Farmer tries to stand up and nearly falls down He grabs a
hold of the wall for support Suddenly Jennifer screams

His vision is getting worse as he looks in the direction of
the screams but and its almost impossible to make out one
thing from another

Then suddenly hes PUNCHED across the face The drugs have
done more than their toll and hes unable to keep his
balance He crashes to the floor

GAS MASK (CONTD)
distorted)
Get up Farmer

Farmer tries to regain his bearings Once again hes met
with a CRUSHING blow that sends him back down to the floor

Farmer starts to get up when his hand falls on something He
doesnt need to see to know its his GUN He sits up
aimlessly pointing the gun around the room

Farmers head is pounding like a drum He can’t make out one
voice from the next

GAS MASK (CONTD) JENNIFER
(screaming)

Im over here Farmer SEAN NO

Farmer points his gun in the direction of the voices but
cant make out the gas masked man

GAS MASK (CONTD)
Fuck Rookie you’re a mess Put
that down before you hurt
yourself

FARMER
PipPiper

Farmer struggles to remain conscious but is quickly losing
the battle He closes his eyes as passes out as we

FADE TO BLACK

INT APARTMENT - LATER

We hear screaming over the darkness Slowly Farmer starts to
come to

JENNIFER
(frantically screaming)
Sean Wake up Sean

He squints to focus but manages to make out Jennifer just a
few feet away from him

FARMER
(groggy )
Jennifer

Farmer tries to get up but the effects of the drugs are still
impeding his motor skills He uses the wall to help make his
way over to her

FARMER (CONTD)
Are you okay Jennifer

JENNIFER
(hysterically crying)
Nohedontdont come near

FARMER

He squints and manages to see Jennifer is now strapped from
head to toe with HOME MADE EXPLOSIVES

JENNIFER
I’m handcuffed to the wall

andand Piper has the key
(beat)

Sean just get out of here the
entire place is rigged with
explosives

FARMER
No I can disconnect it
JENNIFER
Farmer just go

Farmer struggles to focus as he gets a good look at the
explosive The timer reads a little over a minute left
Farmer follows a red cord from the timer back to the base of
the explosive

FARMER
All I have to do is cut

He pulls out a pocketknife and holds it to the wire Hes
about to cut the wire when he leans in closer to look at an
adjacent blue wire He slowly moves the blade to the blue
wire He closes his eyes as he takes a deep breath The
clock approaches twenty five seconds

JENNIFER
Just get out of here

Twenty fivetwenty fourtwenty three

FARMER

Farmer opens his eyes carefully moving the blade back to the
red wire

JENNIFER

FARMER

JENNIFER

JENNIFER (CONTD)

a chance I knew

FOURTHREETWOONE

Jennifer screams NOTHING The explosive doesnt go

off
Completely drained Farmer stands stoically staring at
Jennifer He slowly turns his head to locate his GUN on the
floor

He picks it up off the floor and returns to Jennifer

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Sean

He just stares at her

FARMER

(numb )
Everything you’ve said and done has
been bullshit The break-in at your
office pretending to care You
killed those people

(beat)
You said Amy was your friend

Farmer points his gun at her as he shakes uncontrollably with
rage

FARMER (CONTD)
Those people needed your help
andand you killed them

Suddenly a scream is heard from the hallway

JASON (0C)
Farmer

Farmer turns toward Jasons plea

JENNIFER
Sean don’t

He doesn’t let her finish Farmer quickly makes his way out
into the hallway

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

With his gun drawn and his vision horribly impaired he
struggles to see as he makes his way down the dark hall

Farmer stops leans up against the wall He takes a deep
breath and tries to clear his head Suddenly he sees
someone flash by just up a head Farmer quickly reacts and
gives chase

He approaches the corner and carefully peers down the other
end of the hall It’s empty
JASON (0C)
Farmer

Jasons close Farmer quickly continues down the hall toward
his voice Once again he’s reached a corner He starts to
peer around the edge when he hears something behind him

He whirls around pointing his gunat an empty hall He
slowly backs up toward the corner as we quickly pan up to
revealPiper’s HORRIBLY BURNED FACE He’s gruesome

terrifying and now he’s standing directly behind Farmer

Farmer stands completely unaware of Piper Suddenly the
sounds of a huge EXPLOSION rips through the silence

FARMER
Jennifer

Farmer starts to take a step back in the direction he just

came from He quickly stops at the sounds of someone behind
him He quickly turns to findnothing Piper is no where
to be found

JASON (0C
Farmer

Farmer torn between which direction to go hesitates for a
beat

JASON (0C) (CONTD)
Farmer

His mind is made up as he continues after Jason He makes
his way around the corner and is GRAZED with a bullet

Farmer instinctively falls to the ground and returns FIRE

With the wall in between them Piper and Farmer exchange
rounds

Farmer picks himself up off the ground and peers around the
corner during a break in the gun fire Piper comes out guns
blazing as the exchange continues with Farmer barely avoiding
being hit

Farmer takes a deep breath as he reloads As soon as he’s
finished he turns the corner and unloads the entire clip
Piper ducks back behind the wall to avoid being hit

Farmers rounds cause a support beam to give way forcing
Piper to dive out of the way to avoid being crush Farmer
sensing his chance makes his way toward Piper
As soon as he takes a step forward there’s another huge
EXPLOSION behind him It’s sends him flying through the air
as the entire building shakes

Piper picks himself up off the ground and charges toward
Farmer The floor quickly starts to give way at his feet

He struggles to keep from falling through to the floors below
as Farmer tries to get up

Another EXPLOSION rips through the building causing both men
to lose their footing Piper and Farmer start sliding down
toward one another Struggling to keep from falling through
Piper raises his gun Farmer manages to knock the gun out of
his hand just as he fires

Farmer pulls his weapon only inches from Piper’s face CLICK
He’s out of bullets Piper sensing his opportunity PUNCHES
farmer in the face sending his gun flying

They start to exchange blows as they slowly inch closer to
the opening in the floor

Piper starts to fall through the opening but Farmer manages
to catch him

Farmer struggles to hold him as Piper dangles helplessly over
the huge drop He notices the KEY hanging from Piper’s neck
Blood starts to pour freely from his gun wound as they make
eye contact with one another

PIPER
All they had to do was overcome
their fears

FARMER
You murdered them Piper

PIPER
I gave everyone the chance to live
That’s something you never gave me
Farmer

Farmer continues to hold on He tries to pull Piper up with
one hand as he reaches for the key around his neck Slowly
Piper starts to climb up Farmer’s arm

PIPER (CONTD)
Imagine my surprise when the doctor
got in touch with me My part was
all worth ithelp these people
and she would give me you

Just as Farmer is about to grab the key Piper uses his free
hand to push his fingers directly into Farmer’s bullet wound
Farmer grimaces in pain as he releases Piper’s arm

As another EXPLOSION goes off Farmer watches as Piper falls
hard to the ground and is PIERCED with a piece of splintered
wood

As Piper lies motionless Farmer carefully gets up finds his
gun and RELOADS He quickly makes his way down the hall
turns the corner and finds the hall engulfed in FLAMES

FARMER
Jason

There’s no answer Farmer turns down another hall to avoid
the flames

FARMER (CONT’D)
Jason

He rounds a few more corners and soon finds himself back
outside the apartment from earlier He reaches for the door
knob but quickly retracts his hand

He wraps his hand with his shirt sleeve as he quickly opens
the door to reveal the room engulfed with smoke and fire

Once again we hear the sound of Farmer’s heart racing His
breathing accelerates rapidly He stands frozen against the
wall

FARMER (CONTD)
(yelling)
Jennifer

There’s no answer Farmer tries to step into the room but
can’t manage to cross the threshold

FARMER (CONTD)
Jennifer

JENNIFER
(in between coughs)
Sean

Farmer tries again in vain to enter the room He starts to
shake uncontrollably

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Help me

Farmer closes his eyes and concentrates He takes several
slow deep breaths The sound of his heartbeat begins to slow
down and eventually returns to normal

Farmer opens his eyes and LEAPS through the flaming
doorway

INT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The smoke is overwhelming as Farmer follows the sounds of
Jennifer’s voice

JENNIFER
Sean

Shes directly in front of him We can barely make out her
silhouette in the smoke

FARMER
Just back away

Jennifer leans to the side as Farmer aims the gun at the
chain As he leans back and is about to fire we seePiper
charging He is about to stab Farmer with the splintered
piece of wood he landed on

JENNIFER
Sean

Farmer whirls around and unloads his clip into Piper As
BULLET after BULLET rips into Piper he’s knocked backwards
Soon he’s directly in front of the window

As Farmer stops firing Piper reaches down to touch the bullet

holes He begins to tidier off balance for a beat and then
eventually falls through the window

Farmer quickly turns his gun back to the chain andCLICK
He’s out of bullets He begins to frantically pull at the
chain

FARMER
Fuck

Farmer’s shirt sleeve catches on fire but he manages to
quickly put it out He continues to struggle with the chain

as the flames and smoke quickly become unbearable

Suddenly a hand grabs Farmer from behind He whirls around
and is ready to strike when we see itsMARY the UNCONSCIOUS
AGORAPHOBIC WOMAN
MARY
Please

Farmer continues to struggle with the chain

JASON
(in between coughs)
Farmer

Farmer turns to find Jason struggling with the smoke and
fire He quickly turns back to the chain

FARMER
I can’t

Jason grabs a hold of his shoulder and tries to pull him
away At first Farmer resists Then with his eyes locked
with Jennifer’s he lets Jason pull him away

JENNIFER
NO Sean don’t leave me

FARMER
(softly)
I’m sorry

With Farmer now leading the way Jason and Mary make their
way through the burning apartment toward the door Farmer
heads out into the hallway

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Farmer steps into the hall with Jason close on his tail
He’s about to move down the hall when he notices Mary is no
longer with them

He turns to find her standing in the doorway

FARMER
Come on

MARY
II can’t

FARMER
Let’s go

MARY
I haven’t left my apartment in
fifteen years

FARMER
Not again

In one swift move Farmer makes his way into the doorway and
throws her over his shoulder With Jason close on his heals
Farmer quickly moves down the hallway

EXT BUILDING - LATER

Jason quickly makes his way out of the building to find
FIREFIGHTERS and POLICE OFFICERS trying to make their way
inside After a coughing fit he turns to find that Farmer
hasn’t made it outside yet

He tries to make his way back inside but a firefighter is
quick to block his path

JASON
Farmer

Farmer barely able to walk stumbles out of the building
with the agoraphobic woman on his back He barely makes it
through the front door when he crumbles to the ground
Several firefighters rush to his aid

FARMER
(to a firefighter)
There’s still someone in there

The firefighters starts to make their way inside when
suddenly there’s one HUGE EXPLOSION after another

FIREFIGHTER
Get everyone back

Farmer sinks to the ground and helplessly watches as the
building continues to burn out of control

INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER

Farmer with his wounded shoulder now in a sling paces back
and forth by the reception desk He looks like he has the
weight of the world on his shoulders

He sees a nurse holding a medical chart walking by and stops
her

FARMER
Excuse me I’m waiting on news
about the two people I brought in

The nurse reviews her charts

NURSE
Oh right the agoraphobic Mrs
Roth

(MORE)
The nurse

The nurse
and turns

The nurse

NURSE (contd)
She was in shock from the incident
which is expected We calmed her
down with some meds She should be

fine

FARMER
How about the young man Jason
Phoenix

glances back down at her chart and flips the page

NURSE
Phoenixthe doctor found him to
be in perfect health You can see
him if you like

turns to leave when farmer grabs her by the wrist
her attention back to him

FARMER
In perfect health I don’t
understand
Why hasn’t he been checked into
rehab

NURSE

FARMER
He’s a heroine addict and needs to
get help

looks at Farmer like he’s crazy

NURSE
Detective according to his blood
work he hasn’t touched heroine a
day in his life

Farmer can’t believe what he is hearing

FARMER
What room is he in

NURSE
Room 610 but you can’t

Farmer doesn’t stay to hear the rest He rushes off to find
Jason’s room
INT HOSPITAL ROOM 610 - MINUTES LATER

Farmer hurries into the room The only bed is surrounded by a
privacy curtain Farmer pulls the curtain open

Jasons bed is empty Farmer notices a video tape sitting on
his pillow The tape reads “PLAY ME”

Farmer quickly puts the tape in the room’s VCR He watches
in silence video footage of the death of Nathan Winters the
needle victim

The sound of the tape cannot be heard The only sound we hear
is the thoughts running through Farmer’s head

SAM (VO)
It looks like there might be an
overlap in the times of two of the

kidnappings

TRINA PIPER (VO)
He only goes to two places He’s
either with the young man he
tutors

JENNIFER (VO)
I had Piper under control butbut
when Nathan Winters was never given
a chance I knew

PIPER (VO)
I gave everyone the chance to live

The last line continues to echo in Farmer’s head as he sits
dazed He stands grabs the television and knocks it onto
the floor

PIPER (VO) (CONTD)
I gave everyone the chance to live

Farmer can’t take it anymore

SAM (VO)
(excitedly)
We got a hit on the partial from

the needle

Farmer sinks to the ground and helplessly stares at the wall
EXT BOOKSTORE - AT THAT MOMENT

We see Jason Phoenix strolling out of a bookstore with a bag
in hand He looks like an ordinary 18yr old kid clean and
sober

He reaches into the bag and pulls out his recently purchased
item Jason holds a book We pull back to see the books
title “Fears and Phobias”

Jason looks up with a sinister smile We pull back some more
to reveal Jason is headed for the bus station

We continue to pull back as we

FADE TO BLACK
