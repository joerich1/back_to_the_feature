PART TWO
FADE IN
ACT 1
EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

A boundless seascape the tiny Pequod far in bg
Beyond the orange sun disappears below the horizon

In fg a huge white mass surfaces with jarring
suddenness -- MOBY DICK a hundred feet of scarred
barnacled tonnage The spout from his forehead
blows out a geyser of mist clouding our view

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - TOPMAST - DUSK
High on the lookout Ishmael points excitedly

ISHMAEL
There she blows again Hard
to port beam

EXT QUARTERDECK - DUSK

Ahab his blazing eyes fixed on the distant whale
suddenly reels about with an earth-shaking roar

AHAB
Clear away the boats

STARBUCK
In the night Captain

AHAB
Clear away I said

STARBUCK
Ye want us to give him chase
in the NIGHT

AHAB
Aye In the night -- well

his whiteness better than by
daylight

Starbuck hesitates Ahab turns hard to him

AHAB (contd)
Order the men Starbuck

STARBUCK
Aye aye sir
(to the men)
Prepare to lower away boats

EXT MIDDECK - DUSK

Jarred from their astonished stares the crewmen
scramble into action Ishmael rope-slides to the
deck like an expert seaman Pip runs the length of
the ship shaking his tambourine yelling excitedly

Ahab strides toward the main mast and stops in front
of the nailed gold coin He bangs a fist on it

AHAB
My harpoonersstrike and
the gold will be yours

Tashtego looks up from a loggerhead feeding out
line He raises his harpoon like an Apache warrior

TASHTEGO
WOO-HAA-HEE Aye Captn
Dat Moby Dick come near Tash
an he be a dead fish

Dagoo leaps into a boat lines wrapped around his
shoulders and tied to his two harpoons one in each
hand He lifts them high a flash of teeth

DAGOO
KEE-HA KEE-HA He might
see a white man by night --
but not Dagoo I11 kill
‘im for ye Captn and win
that gold

Fedallah snickers at him from the spare boat shaking
his head with a self-confident sneer

Queequeg leaps onto the bulwark with raised harpoon

QUEEQUEG

Smoke out him pipes me will
Make-em straight dat crooked
jaw

Ahab tosses a lance at Queequeg who takes it on the
fly with a powerful war cry

QUEEQUEG (contd)
HALA-LA PAO-LOO FA-TONGA

In the bustle Pip sneaks through the boarding gate
and climbs unseen over the side

All the whalers pile en masse into the lowering boats

EXT SHIPS SIDE - DUSK

Four whaleboat keels hit the water in tandem -- one
quick SPLASH-DOWN after another

Ahab full of sudden youthful energy swings over the
side on a halyard and rope-climbs down fast toward
Fedallahs boat His hands slip the last few feet --
he falls hard into the boat with a CRUNCH He tries
to stand but he cant His peg leg is splintered

The crew turns to Ahabs SHOUT OF RAGE ringing out

in the dusk An Arab rower tries to help him Ahab
pushes him away He picks up pieces of his jaggedly
broken peg leg tosses them into the water Hobbles
his way to the stern booming to his rowers

AHAB
START her men Start her
like thunderclaps Like
a thousand grinning devils

The Arabs row out like demons possessed Fedallah
takes his place at the bow silent and stealthy

Ishmael and Starbuck watch Ahab from their boat
unaware of little Pip climbing over its stern

He slithers under a box plank and hides behind a
loggerhead basket Starbuck turns around

STARBUCK
Crack on Pull those oars
Ishmael takes an oar Bulkington beside him

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

An aerial view over moonlit waters four whaling
boats lit by pole lanterns One in the lead
three fanned out behind it

To the horizona formidable white shape glides
off into a fog bank

EXT STUBBS BOAT - DUSK
Stubb lights his pipe as his men row furiously

STUBB
Go lads row like the wind

He looks toward Ahabs boat streaking far ahead

Starbucks boat glides by Stubb turns aside

STUBB (contd)
Whod have thought it eh
At night to boot If I had
only one leg ye wouldnt
catch ME in a boat by night
unless maybe to stop a leak
with a whalebone toe

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK
Starbuck turns to Stubbs boat shaking his head

STARBUCK
Hes possessed I tell ye
God has shipwrecked his soul

The boats plunge into a fog bank enveloped in a
moonlit mist

STARBUCK (contd)
Look at this A fog Where
did it come from An look
at us -- rowin blind in the
night after a whale as white
as this fog Was it a whale
we saw or a ghost

Rowing before him Ishmael looks up at the moon
An opaque eye in the thick mists its glow surreal
EXT FLASKS BOAT - DUSK

Flasks boat passes beside Starbucks

FLASK

It was Moby Dick all right
Fog snow or hail I dont
care -- Ill fetch that gold
doubloon or die tryin

(to rowers)
Pull damn ye Show some
muscle

Dagoo sings a rhythmic AFRICAN CHANT the oarsmen
echoing him rowing to his beat

Ahead of them Ahabs boat materializes out of
the dense fog moving steadily forward

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

Ahab stands stiffly by the tiller using it as both
crutch and guide He grips a rowers head of hair
to keep his balance glaring ahead into the white
night as if he could see through the fog A manic
energy in his furrowed-brow concentration

AHAB

Roar and pull ye devils
I can see fifty seas off A
hundred seas Its Moby Dick
out there I tell ye Chase
Crack your backbones bite
your knives in two

(clasping forehead)
Dear Lord Im going to go
stark staring mad

(exhorting on)
Close to ye hairy-hearted
ghouls get me close to him

The Arabs HUM as they row an odd syncopated SOUND
Fedallah stands motionless at the bow harpoon ready
EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Starbuck stares ahead at Ahab with deep chagrin
Ishmael rows his sweaty face glistening under the
boat lamps Behind the basket next to him Pip
crouches in hiding

The sea becomes strangely still Starbuck glances
around him

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

A deathly quiet only the SLAP of oars against the

water BeyondDISTANT GURGLING SOUNDS Ahab
tenses

AHAB
Hark Prick earslisten
EXT FLASKS BOAT - DUSK
FLASK

Hold the oars Hold still

The men raise their oars and look out into the
luminous night Dagoo commands the bow taking
a firm grip of his harpoon

EXT STUBBS BOAT - DUSK
Stubb cups an ear shifting the pipe in his
mouth tuned into every sound around him His
voice hushed
STUBB

Softly softlywhoa babes

Still now
The rowers stop rowing and lift up their oars

Tashtego readies himself at the bow

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

The becalmed waters around the boat spin in rivulets

voice cuts the air like a knife

Starbucks

STARBUCK
Stop

The rowers lift their oars and freeze
Ahead in the fog Ahabs boat drifts soundlessly

Ishmael listens unsettled by the stillness around
him He turns nervously to Starbuck

ISHMAEL
What dye make of it sir--

STARBUCK
Hist Eyes sharp

Everyone watches and listens A long tense beat

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

The fog begins to lifta full view of all four
boats Whalers listen to the eerie quiet

A calm empty sea Then GURGLINGS all around

A SCHOOL OF SPERM WHALES breaches -- a full circle
around the boats With a great SIGH dozens of
spouts release jets of watery air

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Starbuck spins his head around -- whales everywhere

Ishmael stares amazed slack-jawed Queequeg bolts
to the bow with his harpoon

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK
Ahab spins around loses his balance and falls He
rises quickly glaring beyond the black shapes all
around himthen points outside the gentle fleet
of whales his finger like a fixed bayonet

AHAB

There THERE

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

MOBY DICK breaches with a tremendous jump -- three
times the size of the other whales Then swims
steadily away

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK
Ahab crashes his way toward the bow

AHAB
Row you monkeys -- ROW

He seizes Fedallahs harpoon and rushes forward

AHAB (contd)
Move aside

He stumbles and falls keeps going frantically

AHAB (contd)
--LET ME GIVE IT TO HIM

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

A sperm whale suddenly breaches half under the boat
with a HARD BUMP lifting it up The boat slides off
its back landing upright in the water next to it

Wasting no time Queequeg thrusts his harpoon with
great power -- WHISH Deep into the whales hump

A giants GRUNT followed by a thrashing tail
slapping the water beside them Instant chaos
STARBUCK
Stern all stern all Quick

The oarsmen immediately row away from the agonizing
whale and its deadly flukes

STARBUCK (contd)
Give him another Queequeg

Queequeg aims throws another harpoon into the mountain
of thrashing blubber -- another deadly hit

The whales spout gushes spasmodically The air fills
with bloody mist spraying the whalers red as they row
frantically away from the sea beasts death throes

The whale starts to dive Harpoon lines spin out of
the loggerhead basket -- rolls of line uncoil rapidly
the basket shaking violently

Unnoticed by the others frightened Pip scrambles
out from beneath the box plank and stumbles into the
basket -- his little legs tangled in spinning lines

Queequeg lets loose a WAR CRY at the fast-receding
whale Ishmael jumps to his feet straining to get
a look

A QUICK TINY SCREAM startles him from behind

Pip suddenly squirts out past him dragged by a line
and yanked overboard -- into the churning water

ISHMAEL
Man overboard Mister
Starbuck Man overboard

He quickly throws a lifebuoy to the boy Starbuck
sees whats happened but hes too distracted

ISHMAEL (contd)
For Gods sakeits PIP
sir Hes out there

The boat suddenly lurches forward -- dragged at
great speed by the wounded diving whale The
running lines around a stanchion start to smoke

STARBUCK
Wet the line Wet the line

Queequeg dumps a bucket of water over the smoking
rope The boat vibrates with the power of the drag

Gripping the tiller Starbuck quickly scans around him

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK
The circle of panicking whales tightens around the

three boats Ahabs moving beyond it Starbucks boat
is pulled deeper into the fray

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Queequeg snatches up a lance and points urgently at
the taut lines

QUEEQUEG
Me cut-em sir Cut dem
lines fore we be splintered
up by dem whales

STARBUCK
NO Not yetlook

He points forward

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

An opening between the circling whales out toward the
calm moonlit sea The boat flies through the gap
EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Ishmael turns and looks far astern

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

Pip clings to the floating lifebuoy floundering in
the eruption of white water all around him The boy
SCREAMS INAUDIBLY waving a frantic arm for help
EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Ishmael turns to Starbuck in a panic

ISHMAEL
Sir What about Pip--

Beside him Bulkington grips his arm
BULKINGTON
Sit down boy Nothin we can
do

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

Ahab hangs over the prow harpoon held before him
with fixed intensity Dead ahead

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

Outward bound the white whale swims steadily and
obliviouslystill too far to strike

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

AHAB
ROW ROW ROW

He glares back at the other boats but theyre too
far away to offer any support He looks forward

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DUSK

MOBY DICKs giant flukes rise up in the moonlit air
then drop quickly into the calm waterdisappearing
into the deep blue Hes gone

Ahab GROWLS with monumental frustration

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

The lines go slack and the boat suddenly slows
Ishmael jumps up unable to suppress himself

ISHMAEL
Mister Starbuck sir We
cant just act as if nothing
has happened Weve GOT to
go back for him

STARBUCK
Sit down SIT I tell you
before ye wind up in the
water too

ISHMAEL
But hell drown if we dont
go back

Starbuck pushes Ishmael back onto the rowers bench

STARBUCK
Take back that oar sailor
Weve got other business to
attend to We cant just
drop everything and set off
on a salvage mission SIT

He turns his attention back to the becalmed water
Ishmael glances helplessly at Bulkington Queequeg
hauls in the lines as fast as he can

The struck whale surfacesmissing the boat by a
few feet It spins slowly in the water its massive
jaws opening and closing with dwindling energy

Queequeg and two oarsmen pull together on the slack
lines until theyre taut with the harpoons imbedded
in the whale They tow the boat toward the dying
creature

As they pull up alongside it Ahabs boat appears
EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

Ahab guides his craft behind Starbucks boat He
scans the whale with a grave look Subdued now

but storming inside In a quiet voice
AHAB
Did ye not see HIM Mister
Starbuck
STARBUCK

I did sir

Ahab turns a fierce expression on him but his voice
remains low

AHAB
And why did ye strike THIS
whale if ye could see Moby
Dick
EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Starbuck is silent for a beat

STARBUCK
Im a whaler sir

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK

Long silent eye contact Ahab abruptly turns away

and waves at his Arab oarsmen His boat pulls away

from Starbucks Ahab calls back over his shoulder

AHAB
Get that blubber on deck
tonight Starbuck before
daylight Well be pushin
on in the morning

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

Starbuck glances at Ishmael He quickly shouts to
Ahabs retreating boat

STARBUCK
What about the boy sir

EXT AHABS BOAT - DUSK
Ahab signals his oarsmen and the boat slows

In bg Stubbs and Flasks boats row in close to
join them the whalers assessing the new kill

Ahab turns his face in shadow like a phantom in
the still gloom

AHAB
What boy

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DUSK

STARBUCK
Pip sir Hes lost at sea

Stubbs boat steers side by side with Starbucks

STUBB
Aye I saw him myself Miles
of sea between him and us by
now We cant afford to lose
this fine kill on account of
that minstrels foolishness

AHAB
Pip ye say The tambourine
boy And how did HE come
to be in your boat Mister
Starbuck

STARBUCK
Stowed away sir where he
wasnt supposed to be Hes
just a shipkeeper Captain
a tender-hearted jolly boy

and I fear weve lost ‘im

Ishmael waits expectantly full of worry Queequeg
too looks concerned and steps forward
QUEEQUEG
Me go find Pip Pip be dead
dat be bad magic

Across the water Ahab deliberates for a beat He
grunts to his Arabs and they continue to row His
boat drifts away as he calls back

AHAB
Ye have ‘til dawn to find
that ungracious little brat
or whatever the sharksve
left of him so make haste
(to his oarsmen)

Give way now greyhounds
Dog to it

Ishmael breathes a sigh of relief So does Starbuck
as he turns to Bulkington

STARBUCK
Organize a search party
Mister Bulkington And take
Queequeg and Ishmael

BULKINGTON
Aye sir

In bg Flask leans over from his boat and grins at
Queequeg gesturing at the dead whale

FLASK
Seems a shame to leave behind
such a noble prize
Queequeg grunts scoffingly and turns away to the

bow more interested in the rescue than the whale

EXT STUBBS BOAT - DUSK

Starbuck jumps across from his boat into Stubbs

STARBUCK
Lets bring this fish in
Mister Stubb

Stubb glances at Starbucks boat Bulkington now in
command Stubb shakes his head

STUBB
Ye got a hundred barrels of
sperm oil here -- why would ye

be wastin yer mens time
lookin for a cabin boy

STARBUCK
Its the rightful thing to do
A childs life is worth more
than a whales hide

STUBB
Aye cant argue with that

EXT BULKINGTONS BOAT - DUSK

Waving the men to their oars Bulkington gazes out
into the darkness

BULKINGTON
Lets to it boys

The oarsmen row Ishmael wields his oar vigorously
redoubling his efforts

Receding away in Stubbs boat Starbuck shouts back

STARBUCK
Ill bust open a hogshead of
brandy to the man who finds
the boy Will ye spit fire
men

AYE AYES all around They row away from the other
boats Queequeg perched at the bow scanning the

sea like a hawk

FADE OUT

ACT 2
EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - AFT DECK - NIGHT

A polished harpoon sharpened on a spinning grindstone
sparks flying The sparks fill our view behind them
Ahabs hard-set features Waiting intensely

The Blacksmith raises the harpoon presenting its
two-flued razor head before the Captain Ahab nods
with approval

Glimpsed in bg a gigantic severed whales head
is hoisted and swung suspended over the deck by
pulley chains straining from yard arms The deck
tilts to one side under its heavy weight

Tri-works furnaces burn and boiling pots smoke
adding a nightmarish atmosphere to the scene

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - NIGHT

Deep in the heart of moonlit darkness drifts a
lone lamp-lit whale boat

EXT BULKINGTONS BOAT - NIGHT
Glimmering lanterns held high Bulkington Ishmael
and the men search the calm sea Queequeg peers
intently across the black ominous waters Not a
sign of life The men call out sporadically
CREWMEN

Pip Pip Where are ye boy
INT STARBUCKS CABIN - NIGHT
Starbuck dozes over an open bible on his bunk
a flickering candle beside him The room tilts
timbers GROANING and CREAKING
The candle burns downa TIME-LAPSE EFFECT as

hours pass in secondsto a melted dead stump
by the light of dawn

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAWN

Dawns early light creeps over an endless horizon

Pip clings helplessly to the lifebuoy alone in the
vast emptiness He sings a little DITTY ina
trembling voice

His head jerks around with a moan of despair

A sharks fin streaks through the water with lethal
swiftness circling around him

Pip bobs frantically gasping with terror wide eyes
fixed on the approaching predator

The shark fin disappears under Instinctively Pip dives
EXT UNDERWATER — DAWN

Holding his breath Pip sees the shark closing in with
smaller circles fixed on him with cold unblinking black
eyes Pip waves his arms and legs furiously in a vain
effort to scare off the death mask before him The
circling shark moves in for the kill its jaws widening

Pip manages to land a fist directly onto the sharks nose

It flips its tail darts awaythen streaks in again relentlessly
closer

A massive white wall suddenly fills the deep -- passing

within inches of Pip The shark flees Pip surfaces

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAWN

Pip sucks in air clutching the lifebuoy His wide eyes
on the titantic white whale plunging away leaving swells
in his wake MOBY DICK is gone as quickly as he appears

An empty sea again the waves too high for Pip to see far Then

Another bigger sharks fin approaches Again circling
him again submerging

Pip takes deep gulps of air then dives again

EXT UNDERWATER - DAWN

Pip gapes A great white shark three times larger
It circles once then zeros in Resigned to death
Pip shuts his eyes and exhales bubbles of air

sinking The big shark draws closer closer

A sharp WHISSHHH -- a harpoon spears through the
sharks body Thrashing in a cloud of blood the

great white vanishes from sight
Eyes closed losing consciousness Pip sinks down

A tattooed arm dips down from above -- a hand seizes
Pip by the hair and hauls him up toward the light

INT CAPTAINS CABIN - MORNING

Ahab stands by the cabin window staring morosely at
the rising sun

The Carpenter kneels at his feet working to fit a new
whale-bone peg leg having a difficult time setting it
in its place

CARPENTER
If the Captn pleaseslet
me measure it now sir

Ahab glares down at his poorly fitted stump his
irritation more of a good-humored bark than bite

AHAB
Are you a manmaker Carpenter
that youd measure me like a
suit Well carry onits
not the first time

The Carpenter secures the peg leg with a tightening tool

AHAB (cont )
Accursed fate that my soul
would have such a craven
mate for a body

CARPENTER
How does that feel sir

AHAB
I canst say I only feel
what is not there

CARPENTER
Aye A dismasted man never
loses the feeling of his
lost spar
AHAB
Ah thats bettergood

He bends down and grasps the bone stump with both hands
then grabs the Carpenters tool to tighten it harder

CARPENTER
Oh sir careful sir Itll
break bones that will

AHAB
(laughs bitterly)
No fear I like a good grip
I like to feel something in
this slippery world that I
can hold onto

Ahab straightens up and gazes inwardly

AHAB (contd)
You ever hear of an old Greek
named Prometheus

CARPENTER
No sircant say I ever
shipped with the man sir

AHAB

Prometheus was he who made
men Made ‘em whole with tools
like this

(indicates tool)
Then he animated them from
FIRE Twas he who should have
made mewhats made in fire
must properly belongs to fire

The Carpenter finishes and looks up clearly mystified
by him Ahab looks inspired spilling out the words

AHAB (contd)
Then I wouldve been complete
Fifty feet high in my socks
My legs would have ROOTS my
arms three feet to the wrist
No heart at alleyes No
A skylight atop my head to
light up an acre of brains
Proud as a Greek godAYE
A Greek god
(looks down)
And not standing on a broken
stick of dead bone

He gazes wretchedly at his stump back to reality
AHAB (contd)

Ayemy torn soul and gashed
bodythey bleed into each

other

(to himself)
Aye The truth shakes me
falsely

In bg by the cabin doorway a turbaned figure
lingers in the shadows Fedallah

The Carpenter rises stiffly bent with arthritis

AHAB (contd)
I thank ye Carpenter Now
go back to your fixins
leave Ahab to the gods

CARPENTER
Aye aye sir

He shuffles out Ahab sits deep in his broodings
then recognizes the shadowy presence A gruff
impatient tone

AHAB
What dye want

Fedallah eases into the lamp light an inscrutable
smile of broken teeth His English is thickly
accented his voice gnarled and sibilant

FEDALLAH
The dream comes to me again
of my masters death

Ahab doesnt move or react
AHAB
MY death Then I pray ye go

before me

Fedallah shrugs as if the thought were supremely
indifferent to him

FEDALLAH
I shall As your pilot

AHAB
Well then me pilot I pledge
to ye that I will slay Moby
Dick -- and survive it

Fedallahs voice lowers full of dark meaning

FEDALLAH
Only rope can destroy Ahab

AHAB
(laughs)
The gallows then Ha Well
thenI am immortal

Fedallah slinks back into the shadows saying no
more Ahab glares scornfully after himyet
unnerved by him

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

The suspended whales head stripped of blubber
is hoisted overboard from the lower mast cranes
Almost a skeleton its a ghastly sight

Starbuck oversees crewmen gathered around the port
side working the chains and pulleys and about to
drop it into the sea A SHOUT from the lookout

DAGOO (0S)
Whaleboat to starboard helm
They got PIP

Starbuck and the men rush in unison to the starboard
side WILD CHEERS ring out as Bulkingtons boat
rows in fast

EXT QUARTERDECK - MORNING

Ahab emerges from his cabin and looks down to see

the rescue party climbing aboard Surprised by the
sight of Pip his harsh face softens almost a smile

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

Queequeg boards with little Pip in his arms the boy
dazed but alive Bulkington takes him and hands him
to Flask who gives him to Stubb The men pass the
boy between them like a bucket brigadeto Starbuck
who sits Pip atop an oil barrel

STARBUCK
We missed ye lad Bring ‘im
his music

Pip stares vacantly disoriented Stubb turns to
Bulkington with a laugh

STUBB
Well this is a fine day
Wed given him up for lost

BULKINGTON
Thank Ishmael and Queequeg
They spotted him

Stubb turns to pound Ishmaels back with a mighty
whack

STUBB
By jimminy Youre a credit
to us all

Ishmael smiles proudly as men give him and Queequeg
hearty pats The two trade grins of brotherly
kinship They step over to Pip

Everyone gathers round the boy as Tashtego pushes
the tambourine into Pips hands

TASHTEGO
Gwon Pip Do us a tune

Pip focuses glassy eyes on the tambourine as if he
doesnt recognize it Thenhe throws it violently
to the deck Stunned silent looks all around
Queequeg picks it up with a disturbed frown Ishmael
reaches out to Pip

ISHMAEL
Pipwhat is it boy

Pip scans the mens face as if they were strangers
Ishmael lays a gentle hand on him -- Pip thrashes
out delirious pummeling him with his small fists
Then he leaps off the barrel and dashes away The
men watch horrified

Pip scurries aimlessly around the deck in a wild
panic slips and falls Around him the planks are
slick with whale blood and bones Pip stares at
the blood on his hands then gapes up toward

The giant skeletal whale head hanging over the
side above him Pip gives an ear-shattering SHRIEK

Bewildered the men dont know what to do Queequeg
rushes over and quickly releases a pulley chain

The whale head plummets into the sea a huge SPLASH

Pip staggers up and runs to a whaleboat flailing
his arms as he did underwater with the sharks He
climbs into it as if out of the sea Crouches
inside of it huddled and BABBLING to himself
Completely insane

The crew stares at him with befuddled looks their
morale shattered Queequeg turns grimly to Ishmael

QUEEQUEG
Dis bad magic BAD magic

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Witnessing the scene below Ahab too is affected
But his mind turns elsewhere as he shouts down

AHAB
Prepare to set sail Starbuck
Weve wasted enough time

STARBUCK
Right away sir Up sails

mates lets catch a breeze

Men disperse to their duties too demoralized to jump

to it slowly climbing the masts Ahab booms at them

AHAB
Make speed ye lackies Do
ye not know hes out there
Thunder away at it Well not
be whalers again -- til its

MOBY DICKS head hangin from
these yard arms

Driven by his voice the crew picks up the pace
EXT SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

Clear skies to the horizon The full-sailed Pequod
speeds across deeper bluer waters Her bow dips
and plows through powerful swells

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MASTS - DAY

All sails billow out like canvas balloons masts
swaying in a strong breeze A breathtaking view

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

By the helm Starbuck squints toward the horizon
and checks his compass He turns to the wheelman

STARBUCK
Two points east southeast
Steady before the breeze

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

Starbuck steps down to middeck before a curious sight
at the bottom of the main mast

Ahab stands on the flat seat of a custom-made cradle
suspended a few feet off the deck Stubb and Flask
rig pulley lines beside him Starbuck approaches
Ahab

STARBUCK
If the wind holds up sir
we should be around the Cape
in two days hence

AHAB
Aye but no later than that
(indicates cradle)
Now I too will stand lookout
Is it ready Mister Stubb

STUBB
Secure as a mothers arms sir
AHAB
Starbuck take the rope and
raise your captain I will
commend my life into thy hands

Looks between them as if this were a test of loyalty
Starbuck steps forward takes the pulley line then
hauls Ahabs cradle up the mast with strong hands

AHAB (contd)
Ill have first sight of the
white whale Aye myself

As he ascends he slams a fist against the gold coin

AHAB (contd)
And win back my doubloon

The cradle rises to the maintop swinging in the
breeze Ahab stands like an iron statue keeping
perfect balance fiery eyes fixed to the horizon

All the crew watch his upward progress Fedallah
smiles to himself with feline cunning Watching from
their station Ishmael and Queequeg turn toward Pip
Still in the whaleboat Pip MUTTERS incomprehensibly
to himself in some strange mindless language Never
again will he smile or dance

EXT SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

The Pequod plunges up and down through rolling swells
waves crashing against her bow

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MAINTOP - DAY

Ahabs high cradle swings like a pendulum He keeps
a determined watch rigid on his peg leg

EXT MIDDECK —- DAY
The crew swabs the deck clean None of them notice
Pip who scrambles out of the whaleboat and makes a

beeline for the main mast

He stares dourly at the shiny gold coin nailed to the
wood A whispery singsong voice

PIP

We ye theyare all bats

Ishmael and the others turn watching perplexedly
Pip points to the Captains cabin

PIP (contd)
There In there Two bones
stuck in trousersand one
be not his but a whales

Stubb steps over to observe him chuckling nervously

STUBB
I fear we shouldve left
Pip to his fate poor boy

Pip recoils from Stubb and darts up the mast ropes
like a little monkey

EXT MAIN MAST - DAY

He perches halfway on the ladder GIBBERING AWAY in
mad terror Higher above him Ahab nods off from
weariness

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

Stubb shakes his head up at him He turns to peer
closely at the doubloon Starbuck Flask and
Ishmael join him

STUBB
Sixteen dollars HAH Ive

Not much wonder in ‘em But
whoever kills that white
demon this round thing

belongs to him

FLASK
Its ships bounty to ME
Stubb -- itll win me nine

hundred and sixty cigars

In bg Fedallah chortles mischievously at them with
a toothy grin and shakes his head

STARBUCK
Its the ships navel I tell
ye And everyones on fire
to unscrew it But unscrew
a navel and see what happens

Stubb and Flask look at him uncomprehending Ishmael

nods understandingly

ISHMAEL
Aye To me it speaks wisely
but sadly Its all in ones

STARBUCK
Perception How dye mean

ISHMAEL
Different ways of lookin

school children aboutwhat
Man sees and what God sees
But Man sees only one thing
what he WANTS to see

Starbuck and Ishmael gaze up at Ahab tiring of all
this madness

ISHMAEL

Tis like the old man and
his whale He sees but a
monster of destruction

(turns to Starbuck)
Perhaps in Gods eyes Moby
Dick is just another of His
creatures doin whats
natural

Absorbing this Starbuck looks between lowering Ahab
and the mast coin beside him Its brilliant gold
reflection catches his eyeblinding him

ISHMAEL (contd)
Just that Just a whale
Starbuck shields his eyes and turns away

STARBUCK
Damnable coin Its put here
to blind us all

Ahab lands on the deck before them He quickly
THUNK-CLOPS to the bulwark with feverish energy

AHAB
Steward My eyeglass

Starbuck leans calmly over the side amidst excited
sailors gazing out with an eagles eye

STARBUCK
Its not white Captain its
grey Probably a humpback

Ahab snatches his eyeglass from the Steward and peers
out He cant see well enough and angrily tosses it

AHAB

seaward

STARBUCK

his teeth with his long fingernail Starbuck shouts to

The distant unrecognizable whale dives out of sight
EXT MIDDECK —- DAY

Ahab ROARS frustrated again He paces across the

Stubb turns out of the wind and lights his pipe

STUBB

cunning one that Moby Dick

BULKINGTON
If it WAS Moby Dick

He looks off toward pacing Ahab with deep knowledge

aside to him in deepest privacy nodding toward sea

The Pequod speeds southward through colder waters
her sails straining against the wind On the horizon

end of a harpoon The Blacksmith dumps in a bucket
of whale oil to fuel the tri-works blaze

Bundled in winter coats and scarves Stubb Flask and
others huddle close to the warmth of its open hearth
Ishmael paces nearby to ward off the cold

Starbuck steps over to watch the Blacksmith dip his
bucket into an open oil cask

STARBUCK
Burning the cargo are we now
Wasting our profits

FLASK
What good is our damned profits
if we freeze to death
Starbuck nods resignedly and kneels down to warm
himself beside Bulkington and Pip The men glance
sullenly toward their lone captain on the bow

peaks of passing bergs

EXT BOW DECK - DAY

Ahab stares wearily forward his face frostbitten

his energy sapped by the cold Starbuck approaches him
hugging his coat chilled to the bone Weary irony

in his voice

STARBUCK
Captain Might I be so bold
to suggest that we turn north
now Back on course sir
toward the Cape

Ahab offers no reply eyes fixed forward

STARBUCK
There are no whales in these
waters sir

AHAB
Hes there Mister Starbuck
He dares me to follow
He peers over the masses of ice with forced confidence

AHAB
Ive sailed over Greenland
waters worst than this We can
force through this ice

STARBUCK
Aye but not THIS time of year
The ice is too thick for such
a gamble -- it can break this
ship up into matchwood

AHAB
We will drive on

The Carpenter and the Cook look over from their bunks
CARPENTER
I wouldnt judge ‘im too harshly

COOK

The Carpenter glares back at him

EXT SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY
A forward view of the Pequod the sharp points of two
giant ice floes close in rapidly blocking her path

Men run to the bow bulwarks in alarm

cowers in fear Everyone bolts up and dashes deckside

violently -- the SOUNDS of GNASHING GRINDING ICE

EXT SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY

The Pequod slows to an agonizing halt -- wedged into
the joined points of the ice floes Ice edges grip
her bow hull like a slowly closing vise

EXT BOW DECK - DAY

Starbuck and Stubb rush to the side and look down
Ahab THUNK-CLOPS furiously forward and stares out in

despair crewmen behind him

AHAB
Crack my heart Ive lost him

He leaps down to middeck shouting orders
STARBUCK (contd)
Quick men lower the sheets
Dump the anchors Carpenter

INT SHIPS CORRIDOR - DAY

Starbuck and others clamor downstairs Walls around
them GROAN from the weight of wedged ice

EXT BOW DECK - DAY

Ahab stands fast at the frozen bow oblivious to the
commotion staring at the white vastness around him

AHAB

Oh my insufferable foethy
whiteness blinds me My feud
is undone

He shuts his eyes from the white expanse
INT BOW HOLD - DAY

A bulkhead GROANS and CREAKS from the crushing pressure
outside Starbuck Bulkington and the harpooners lift a
heavy mast timber to shore up the bow walls its length
spanning the full width of the hold The old Carpenter
carries in another huge timber on his back crouched
over like Christ bearing the cross

EXT SOUTHERN OCEAN - DAY

The Pequod sits silent and immobile between the floes
marooned in a prairie of ice Just beyond the wedge
lies a gap of open sea So close so unreachable

INT CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

Ahab moves to an open window and gazes out defeatedly at
the frozen expanse outside an icy breeze in his face
Tears well up in his eyes Then an angry outcry

AHAB

Why must I endure these
torments If I had but ONE
MOMENT flank to flank with
that demon whale Id face a
thousand-fold perils

(clenches a fist)
Damn yer white hide where
ARE ye Show yourself
Show me a sign

He listens to the antarctic silence No sound but the
WHISTLING WIND against his face

He turns and slumps down in a chair before his table of cluttered
maps staring futilely at them

AHAB
So be it

He sweeps them off the table in a fury Then realizes
with a sudden inward horror

AHAB (contd)
Plague my soulI AM Jonah
now The God-fugitive

He buries his face in his hands Sobs uncontrollably

The cabin door creeps openthe shadowy figure of
Fedallah towers before him In bg a commotion of
men running through the corridor

Ahab looks up as Fedallah takes a musket hanging from
a wall and slowly approaches with an inscrutable smile
Ahab hardens noting the weapon with irony

AHAB
What prophecy is this then
A mutiny or a speedy death

Fedallahs silent smile broadens to a grin

AHAB
That bad aye What savagery
have I wroughtso consumed

with the hot fire of my purpose
that Ive murdered my own men

Fedallah draws very close and removes a pouch hanging
from the musket He opens Ahabs palm and trickles a
handful of black powder into it Gunpowder

FEDALLAH
All is not lost my master

Ahab puzzles over the powder in his hand Then a
knowing smile spreads across his face

INT BOW HOLD - DAY

Starbuck Bulkington and the harpooners brace the ends
of a timber under their shoulders pushing and grunting
with herculean strength leaking water streaming over

them

STARBUCK
Push damn ye Harder

A new leak gushes into Dagoos face He lets go in panic

DAGOO
Aint no good We all gonna

drown I aint gon die

He turns to escape the hold -- Bulkington seizes him and
wields a huge Bowie knife against his throat

BULKINGTON
Get back here ye black bastard

Dagoo struggles against him grappling his knife hand

DAGOO
Leggo o me white dog

Locked together might against mightthe Bowie knife
poised between them The stronger of the two Dagoo
slowly turns the blade toward Bulkingtons throat

A SHOT RINGS OUT -- a bullet splinters the bulkhead
inches from their face The two freeze

Ahab looms from the corridor behind them the smoking
musket in hand

AHAB

Then the fight is out there

reveal barrels of gunpowder Hands quickly grab them

to pass through

The crew BELLOWS OUT A MASS CHEER Ahab storms through
their midst addressing all with tornado brows

AHAB
MOBY DICK my hearties Have

He turns and gestures to the gold coin on the mast

AHAB
Upon the day that white whale

sum shall be divided among ye
A piece o gold for EACH AND
EVERY one of ye Now what
dye say to that

Starbuck and the crew stare at him dumbfounded

AHAB

will not come to us -- then
we will come to him DEATH
to Moby Dick

The crew echoes him passionately shouting as one

CREWMEN
MOBY DICK

EXT ICE FLOES - DAY

Crewmen are fanned out on each side of the narrow
waterway -- towing the ship by ropes fastened to her
bow They pull on lines attached to canvas belts
around their waists struggling on foot across the
white ice with all their strength and their hearts
SINGING in rhythm to every straining tug

CREWMEN
Ho The fair wind
Ho-he-ho Cheerily men

Everyone pulls with dogged passion Slaves to their
captains will In bg the tall-masted Pequod
inches ponderously along

velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang But well

Starbuck gazes hard at Ahabs back

STARBUCK
No Captain I shall not
yield to it

INT CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

Deserted quiet The door creeps open Pip ventures
in HUMMING some mad melody Wandering through Ahabs
forbidden domain he comes upon a large carved box and
opens it scrimshaw chess pieces an ivory chess board

Pip runs his hands over exquisitely carved whale pieces
He spills the contents onto the floor Kneeling down

he carefully selects the black king and places it on the
board Looks around the cabin searching for something

He jumps up and snatches up a whale-tooth paperweight
Pip plops back on the floor and places the tooth on the
boardthe white whaledirectly in front of the black
king He leans back and seriously studies the board
HUMMING AWAY Then jumps up and browses around

Two spare whale-bone peg legs protrude from an open
sea chest Pip touches them with a strange reverence

An arctic breeze wafts in from the window and knocks
Ahabs top hat off a clothes rack full of black coats
The hat rolls along the floorstopping before Pip
EXT ICE FLOES - DAY

The Pequod passes through onto open waters Men on the

floes drop their ropes and give her a ROUSING CHEER

over the helm Stubb mans the rigging with Ishmael and
Queequeg Ahab hurries toward his cabin shouting
orders all around

AHAB
Look to the binnacle Square
the yards up there

He stops dead in his tracks staring forward The
others stare in his direction their eyes widening

Framed in the cabin doorway is a tall figure ina
black coat and top hat standing on two white peg legs
Its Pip -- dressed in Ahabs clothes weaving with
precarious balance on whale-bone stilts

Ahab stares at Pips disguise Clearly amused

AHAB
By God its my reflection
in everything but the eyes
Who are ye mister

PIP
Bell-boy sir Ships crier
Ding dong ding Pip Sir

Stubb steps forward to reach out and grab the boy

STUBB

Shhh Hands off His Holiness

The greater idiot ever scolds

He takes Pip in hand Truly smiles for the first
time

AHAB (contd)
Oh frozen heavens look down
upon this luckless child
Here come with me Pip

He ushers him back into his cabin Pip wobbling along

AHAB (contd)
My cabin shall be your home
from now on -- for as long as
Ahab lives Youre tied to me
with cords of heartstrings my
lad youve touched my center
Come along Pip

He ushers him gently inside Starbuck trades confused
looks with Stubb -- who bursts out laughing

STUBB
Blood and thunder Well

One crazy with strength the
other crazy with weakness
A greater idiot am I

Starbuck gives him a look expecting that

Across the patch of rolling waters the CAPTAIN of

to a stay cups his hand to his mouth and shouts

into the deck between Ahabs feet Ahab edges back

With that he struts to the foot of the main mast
plops down on the deck and sits erect and unmoving
Gazing dead ahead Rooted to the spot

Ahab is near exploding He thinks twice glancing
around at the men Faces stare at him Deciding
to ignore Queequeg he marches away to his cabin

In bg little Pip sits on Ahabs bunk bundled up
in the Captains robe toying with chess pieces

In sudden fury Ahab seizes a musket hanging on a
wall He points it at Starbuck who stands defiant

AHAB
Ye insubordinate bastard
Back to deck -- or by God Ill

Ahab eases his grip taken back by that Starbuck
faces him with calm fortitude a voice of reason

realizes there is no way to reason with this man

STARBUCK
As you wish Captain You
neednt beware of Starbuck
(eyes burning back)
But let Ahab beware of AHAB
Beware of YOURSELF old man

Stunned by his words Ahabs rage dissipates He
lowers the musket regarding him curiously

He quickly exits

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

Queequeg sits at the foot of the mast hunched over
a tiny fire of wood shavings on the deck He CHANTS a
Polynesian ritual praying to his Yojo

Ishmael hunkers down before him terribly concerned

Queequeg chants away withdrawn into himself Dagoo
leans over him and shakes his head

DAGOO

Tashtego appears and kneels down with a handful of
wood shavings He drops them beside Queequeg
Queequeg feeds the shaving into the fire without a
word Just his low rhythmic rumbling chant

ISHMAEL
Tashtego what do ye think
ails him

TASHTEGO
His spirit is ill It be

his time to die

He looks at Queequeg with deep understanding Sings
a low-voiced INDIAN PRAYER as if to guide him along

ISHMAEL
Time to die What manner
of nonsense is that

He shakes Queequeg hard desperate to bring him around

ISHMAEL (contd)

No response
He turns to

Queequeg Enough of this

Dagoo shaking his head

ISHMAEL (contd)
Such madness First the old

STARBUCK

as Dagoo appears with the Carpenter

ISHMAEL

set him afloat in a canoe

(rises up)
A coffin Hes spoken to

how warriors are buried in
his homeland

Starbuck shakes his head in bafflement
The Carpenter shuffles forward

CARPENTER
Aye so Whats he want
ISHMAEL
A coffin that floats Can
ye manage that

The Carpenter shrugs Without a second thought he
produces a string and measures Queequegs tattooed
body length and breadth Then he shuffles away

During this Queequeg mutters a final prayer to his
Yojothen promptly tosses it on the fire

ISHMAEL
Queequeg Thats your god

QUEEQUEG
No more Dont matter wedder
be Fiji god or Nantucket god

(deep whisper)
No more god

He withdraws back into his chanting impervious now
to Ishmael lost in a world beyond communication

Ishmael looks plaintively between Starbuck Dagoo and
Tashtego Their grim expressions offer no solace

The Yojo burns An ominous chill to the scene

Pip sleeps in Ahabs bunk twitching from terrible
dreams The Captain sleeps fitfully in an armchair by
the bunk He too has nightmares his sweat-sheened
head tossing from side to side his fists clenched
One of his hands momentarily opens torn by his
fingernailshis palm bloody

EXT MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN

Strong winds buffet the deck Queequeg sits rigidly
under the mast in the same spot as if in a frozen
coma A squall whips away the ashes before him

Ishmael sleeps close by his friend huddled in a
blanket MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS stirs him awake Not
moving he watches a shadow streak across the deck

A small dinghy drops overboard SPLASHES down its
tow line strung to the deck above

A figure leans over the landward railing feeding
out rope Bulkington his back turned to us He
starts to climb over -- a hand clamps on his shoulder

Starbuck behind him Bulkington stiffens defensively
STARBUCK

Clutch my soul Have ye
gone mad too Bulkington

BULKINGTON
I got a young bride waitin
for me sir Its not my

fate to die with that man

He nods toward the captains cabin Starbuck seems
to understandthen slowly reaches into a coat
pocket

Bulkington tenses The Bowie knife materializes
in his hand

BULKINGTON
I always liked ye Starbuck
but dont try to stop me

Starbuck stops hand in his coat A long tense
beat between them Thenhe withdraws a letter

STARBUCK
Its for my missus If ye
make it to Nantucket Id be
grateful if yed pass it on

Bulkington nods and takes the letter A moment of
communion between two reasonable men They look at
the silhouetted African vista against the dusky sky

BULKINGTON
Why dont ye give it to her
yourself Theres room in
the boat

Starbuck smiles and shakes his head Bulkington
leaps over and starts to climb down the ships side
He takes his knife and cuts the tow line Then
stabs it down into the bulwark top
BULKINGTON (contd)
Youll need that more than

me May God go with ye mate

With that he descends into his boat Starbuck steps
up to the bulwark to watch him

EXT CAPE HORN SEAS - BEFORE DAWN

Bulkington rows fast toward the rocky shore the dinghy
a dark form on the choppy treacherous waters

EXT MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN

Starbuck gazes longingly after him His eyes sweep along
the expanse of land beyond then turns back on Bulkington

EXT CAPE HORN SEAS - BEFORE DAWN

In the distance the dinghy rides the crest of a steep wave
then dips down propelled too quickly toward the shore rocks
boat smashes against the rocks -- its timbers shatter

out from a powerful crashing wave Bulkington is gone
EXT MIDDECK - BEFORE DAWN

Starbuck looks on in abject horror He shuts his eyes from
the doomed sight slamming a fist against the bulwark top
with angry despair He lowers his head in grief and opens
his eyes His grim gaze falls on

The big Bowie knife protruding from the top

EXT CAPE HOPE SEAS - DAY

The Pequod approaches the blustery Cape of Good Hope her
bow dipping in the swells

The horizon before her is black with thunderheads A storm
dead ahead

INT CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

The

Chess pieces are scattered around Pip who lies on the floor He
plays a game of battle between the black king and the

white whales tooth crashing them against each other with animated
sounds

PIP
Crish crash damn yer eyes
Die ye white fiend Splash
Beware the tail splat Ahh

Ahab pores over his sea charts exhausted for lack of sleep The
overhead lamps swings the cabin sways Distracted by
Pip Ahab half-smiles at the boy

The door cracks open and Starbuck peers in

STARBUCK
Sorry to disturb ye sir

Ahab goes back to his maps without reply his usual severe manner
Starbuck steps in and stands by the door acting
polite to hide his contempt

STARBUCK (contd)
The oil barrels are leaking
sir The cask woods rotten

AHAB
So Tar them up

STARBUCK
It would be more prudent to
ship into the next port and

replace the lot of ‘em

AHAB
Mister Starbuck well not
stray from our course Is

that understood

STARBUCK
Were losin our profit sir
Would ye wish to strip the
men of all hopes of cash

AHAB
(an ironic tone)
Cashaye a hard matter that
Hard it is that to fire others

the match must be wasted
(dismissing him)
Tar up the barrels

STARBUCK
That wont be good enough--

AHAB
Mind your words Starbuck
Those are my orders

Hard looks between them Seething under the surface
Starbuck starts to speak again

AHAB (contd)
That is all

Starbuck turns away eying him with pity and hatred
EXT MIDDECK - DAY
The deck pitches and rolls on the brewing seas Men
climb spider-like across the yards trying to control
the wind-beaten sails Stubb shouts up at them
STUBB
Furl those tgallant sails
And close reef them topsails
fore and aft
Starbuck marches over to them shouting over the wind
STARBUCK
A word with you Stubb You
too Flask

FLASK
What now

STARBUCK
Now

The three hurry away Under SHRIEKING wind a SOUND

from below deck the BANGING of the Carpenters hammer

At the foot of the main mast Queequeg is still frozen
in the same position Chanting prayers oblivious to
the blasting wind and tossing deck

Kneeling beside him Ishmael prods a cup of steaming

chowder at him

ISHMAEL
For Christs sake Queequeg
ye got to eat Come on now
just a few sips then ye can
go back to your prayers

Queequeg keeps chanting at a steady rhythm as if
Ishmael doesnt exist Ishmael gives up in despair

ISHMAEL (contd)
My poor savagemy pagan
friend whod gladly die for
medont ye understand
I dont want ye to die

The Carpenter appears hauling a coffin up on deck
He loses his balance from the pitch of the ship
falling under the coffins heavy weight

Ishmael hastens over to help him Crewmen ignore

the struggling pair turning superstitious faces away
to avoid looking at the coffin Dragging it across
to the mast the two slide it before Queequeg

Suddenly aware of the coffin Queequeg snaps back
to reality He leans forward to examine it

The Carpenter opens the lid and gives him a look

CARPENTER
Got to do a fittin

Queequeg nods understanding He takes his harpoon
and rises unsteadily on cramped legs Then steps
into the coffin and lies down like a model corpse
resting the harpoon on his chest

Ishmael watches deeply chagrined by it all

The Carpenter nods satisfied Queequeg rises and
steps out He squats back down against the mast
and continues chanting Completely tuned out again

INT BARREL HOLD - DAY

The dark bowels of the ship Oil barrels are piled
high against the hull The three mates stand in an
inch of leaking oil covering the floor balancing
themselves to the ships lilting sway

Starbuck illuminates the sinister hold with a lamp
Stubb and Flask staring at him

STUBB
How dye mean usurpation

STARBUCK
A captain cannot use a ship
for ill-gotten gains other
than for the purposes of her
owners Its in the code
of merchant seamen

FLASK
Were not merchantmen were
whalers

Starbuck gestures down at the oil-flooded floor
charged with angry energy

STARBUCK
Are ye that blind to whats
happenin here All that we
toiled for is bein wasted --
and HELL not lift a finger
to save it He doesnt CARE

Disturbed by him Stubb starts to lights his pipe
with a cinder Flask leans forward urgently

FLASK
Careful there Stubb The
whole damn ship could go up

Eying the oil leak Stubb cautiously puts the pipe away

STUBB
Whatre ye proposin mate

STARBUCK
We have the legal right to
refuse all further obedience
We can even wrest command of
this ship

Stubb trades disconcerting looks with Flask

STUBB
Thats dangerous talkI
cant abide by it If the
Captn says to tar up the
barrels lets tar ‘em up

STARBUCK
Open your eyes man Were
not whalers any more were
just sheep followin a
madman Wanderin from
all mortal reason

STUBB
Aye that might be true
but Ahabs still captn And
a fearless one at that

FLASK
Aye a mighty captn The
king of the seas the lord of
leviathans -- we cant go up
against that
Starbuck turns away frustrated trying to collect
his wits to get through to them

STARBUCK
Listen to me well mates
a fearless man is far more
dangerous than a coward
No storms nor whales can
match the terrors menacing
us from the brow of an angry
man We MUST NOT let Ahabs
fatal pride drag this ship
down to doom with him

STUBB
But MUTINY sir Thats an
idea born of an undigested
stomach Thats a killin
ground youre standing on

FLASK
Aye Ill have no part of it

He turns and climbs out of the hold Starbuck looks
at Stubb with unyielding eyes Stubb shakes his head

STUBB

This is a sharkish business
were in Starbuck Are ye
shark enough for THIS

STARBUCK
I can no longer stand by to
the willful murder of this
good crew I cannot obey my
God by obeying HIM Do ye
understand me Stubb

STUBB
I do mate But I ainta
religious man nor a brave
one Ye stand alone

Dark thunderclouds blot out the sunset The Pequod
drives on between mountainous waves that seem to
engulf it Dead aheada black roiling tempest

EXT MIDDECK - DUSK

Powerful winds pound the deck Stubb shouts at
sailors on the rigging

STUBB
Back the mainyard and break
out the mainhold A sea
storms comin to greet us

He stares at Starbuck who paces the aft deck and
glances repeatedly at the Captains cabin Stubb
frowns sensing his moral dilemma

Ishmael pulls hard on a halyard turning to glimpse
his friend Queequeg still sits in the same place
swaying to the ships rise and fall The coffin
slides around him

INT CAPTAINS CABIN - DUSK

Pip sleeps on the floor amidst a flotsam of chess
pieces curled up peacefully at Ahabs feet like a
napping pup

Dozing in his armchair Ahab resembles more a weary
old pensioner than a raging tyrant The cabin sways

around him STORM WINDS HOWLING in bg Ahab opens
his tired eyes and peers down at Pip

AHAB
Poor gentle mad Pip

He opens a locket and gazes at a miniature portrait
of his young wife and baby son in better times His
warm gaze turns dark and bitter He shuts away the
locket from sight and mind Stormy again

AHAB (contd)
Oh were I the wind Id
blow no more on this wicked
wolfish world Where lies
that final harbor where we
unmoor no more

He clutches his forehead wracked by a strange agony

AHAB (contd)

God stave my brain -- how
he GORES me Accursed whale
begone from my head or Ill
clear the world of thee

(looks madly around)
If I could only sleepbut
Ahab never sleeps he only
feel feels feels Aye
thats tingling enough for
mortal man

He focuses on the twisted sheets of his bunk tormented
AHAB (contd)
My grave-dug berth my tomb
Ahab and anguish together
in one hammock Dear God
I must sleep

He rests back in the chair and dozes off again

A long beat A shadow creeps into the cabin We follow
the padded footfalls of wet boots across the floorup to
a pair of trousersthen the Bowie knife in Starbucks
hand

Starbuck looms over dozing Ahab in the armchair The
swinging lamp casts surreal dancing shadows Slowly
raising the glistening blade Starbuck inches toward
the Captainthen stops staring down at Pip

sleeping docilely at his feet

Starbuck lowers the knife He cant do it Ahab
stirs Starbuck buries the knife away in his belt
Ahabs groggy eyes blink open focusing on the
figure before him

AHAB

A ferocious GALE RISES above deck matching the
storm on Starbucks face

STARBUCK

A typhoon rages Huge waves sledge-hammer the deck
Men rush about the washed deck in the blasting winds
and torrential rain lashing down everything in sight

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

At the helm Stubb struggles to keep the wheel steady
fighting for balance singing at the top of his lungs

STUBB
Oh jolly is the gale anda

Starbuck climbs up the quarterdeck steps toward him

STARBUCK
Avast mate Let the storm
do the singin Be a braver

man and hold your tongue

Stubb laughs -- a gigantic wave washes over them He
shakes the sea water from his eyes

STUBB
I told ye I werent a brave
man Starbuck Im a coward
if truth be knownand Ill
sing to keep up my spirits
No way to stop me sir but
to cut my throat

STARBUCK
Well jump overboard and
sing away if you must

Ahab appears on deck face illuminated by a blinding
flash of lightning A deafening THUNDER CLAP

Starbuck and Stubb regard him warily Stubb grips the
wheel harder trying to control it

STUBB
Bad work Mister Starbuck
Bad work The seas havin
its way We cant fight it
Nobody can Not even HIM

Starbuck helps him with the wheel looking up torn
sails flap violently men nearly thrown off the rigging

STARBUCK
Well go no further in this
squall We must turn round

He struggles his way toward the Captain

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Queequeg sits glued to the foot of the mast chanting
undaunted by the tempest Sea water washes over him
Ishmael staggers over holding on for dear life

ISHMAEL

Come on mate -- youll be
washed overboard

Queequeg will not budge Another powerful wave slams
Ishmael against the mast

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab clings to a rail unbending in the wind his eyes
fixed outward to the boiling sea Starbuck hurries

desperately over

STARBUCK
Captain sir We could turn
this gail into a fair wind if
we TURN ABOUT -- let it drive
us toward home Leeward
sir and homeward

AHAB
Dont lecture me Starbuck
I know these seas as I know
myself Never think this
voyage over -- before Moby
Dick is in my grasp

A wave crashes over them -- Starbuck collides against
the deckhouse Ahab holds fast rooted to the rail

Starbuck grapples his way back toward him

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Ishmael clings to the mast gripping Queequeg trying
to keep him from washing away Queequeg sits there
making no move to save himself from the onslaught

Starbuck rushes over and grabs a handhold by the mast

STARBUCK
Get ‘im below

ISHMAEL
He wont move sir

Grabbing a rope Starbuck hoists Queequeg up
STARBUCK

Lets raise ‘im upagainst

The two struggle to lift the limp giant to a standing
position flat against the mast Starbuck lashes him
to it wrapping the rope around his chest and waist

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab stands rigid defiant against the storm A
vision catches his eye far out to sea

EXT CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT

A large white form materializes over the crests of
giant waves Indistinguishable it could be a huge
whitecapor it could be a white whale

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab glowers at it with murderous eyes To him
it is Moby Dick He spins around toward the crew
below pointing outward

AHAB
Hes THERE men Hes riding

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Holding on the men turn seaward They see nothing
Starbuck shouts up from the mast

STARBUCK
Captain -- leave that whale
to his ghostly wanderings
We must save our ship

A lightning bolt strikes a life raft at the stern
with a violent CRACK -- the raft flies overboard
and falls burning into the sea

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab turns back and fixes on the image at sea
EXT CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT

Visible now in the flashes of lightning like a

blurry mirage MOBY DICK plunges through swells and
whitecaps Following the same course as the ship

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Convinced of what he sees Ahab gestures over the
heaving rail like a messiah
AHAB
Behold shipmates Believe

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

The men stagger to reach the bulwark All stare out
into the black maelstrom straining their eyes

EXT CAPE HOPE SEAS - NIGHT

Thousands of whitecaps over dark raging waters But
no sign of a whale

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Ahab points and exhorts the men below spurring them on

AHAB

his magnitude his malignity
Most monstrous mountainous
sea mastodon against whom we
will declare everlasting war

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT
Flask caught up in Ahabs delusion points excitedly
FLASK
There I see him Captn
EXT CAPE HORN SEAS - NIGHT

Over whitecaps the same blurry mirage -- MOBY DICK
Swimming parallel to the ship drawing closer

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Stubb spots him too and nods enthusiastically echoed
quickly by the rest of the crew

STUBBCREW
Aye I see him too There
he blows Clear as day

FLASK
By flukes Is he a ghost

AHAB
Nay Hes as real as DEATH

Behind them Starbuck sees nothing He edges beside
Ishmael who clings to the mast with dazed Queequeg
Straining to see Ishmael turns to Starbuck

ISHMAEL
Where is he sir I dont
see him

STARBUCK

Of course ye dont The old
mans blastin all reason
straight out of their heads

Another tidal wave plows over them with piledriver
force -- Starbuck and Ishmael topple over each other
Queequeg stands secure like Ulysses bound to the mast
chanting dazedly Starbuck rises determinedly and
bounds up the quarterdeck steps

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Starbuck takes the wheel from Stubb and turns it full
circle with all his might The deck lurches to port

Ahab wheels around in rage

AHAB
Avast Away from there

He seizes the wheel from Starbuck demented with fury
AHAB (contd)
Touch not that wheel or Ill

strike ye into eternity

He wrenches Starbuck away and spins the wheel back -- the
ship careens to starboard with whiplash force

Men are thrown across the middeck Flattened against
the deckhouse Starbuck shouts at Ahab

STARBUCK
We must turn about or well
PERISH

AHAB

Nay I say Well DRIVE ON

STARBUCK
WELL LOSE THIS SHIP

Undaunted and driven Ahab helms the ship back into the
storm Starbuck dashes back down to middeck

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

A titantic wave sweeps across the deck submerging
everyone A screaming deckhand washes overboard

Ishmael clamps himself to the mast holding Queequeg
close -- the two momentarily underwater Drenched
crewmen cling to shrouds battling for ground against
wind and sea Their eyes stare up toward

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab at the wheel riding the storm wind beating his
face whipping back his hair a man obsessed Suddenly

a phosphorescent glow reflects off his face
EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Struggling with a halyard Starbuck and Ishmael glance
up at a bizarre phenomenon

A green ghoulish flash skips along the top rigging
sparking out veins of electrical discharge

ISHMAEL
What is it

STARBUCK
St Elmos fire

The other men dont see it their eyes glued on Ahab

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

His body and the wheel all aglow in the otherworldly

green light -- flashing veins sparking down the stern
mast onto the high deck A ghostly mystical sight
Then just as suddenly

The storm abates as if in the eye of a hurricane
The deck keeps pitching wind still HOWLING rain
flying aftbut the assault of waves recedes

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

All the men stand frozen staring up at glowing Ahab
dominating the ship -- as if it is he who has quelled
the storm Then they gape higher up aghast

The St Elmos fire spreads across the tops of the
masts filtering down over sails and rigging Its
green hue transforms -- into a blinding whiteness
STUBB
God have mercy on us all

The crew staggers back in fear Dagoo reflexively
seizes his harpoon to protect himself Tashtego falls
to his knees praying for his life Even Fedallah
and his Arabs fall back in terrified awe Ahab
THUNK-CLOPS down to middeck with a triumphant air

AHAB
Aye Aye shipmates Mark
it well The white flame
but lights the way to the
WHITE WHALE

He snatches the harpoon away from Dagoo and holds it
up into the static stratosphere just above his head

A blinding flash A ring of St Elmos fire engulfs
the harpoon head -- shining a white sparkling beacon

The men GASP in unison trembling before him Starbuck
the lone disbeliever gazes hard at Ahabs grand
performance Ishmael gapes

ISHMAEL
Jesus Christ in heaven What
is he doing

STARBUCK
Oh he knows exactly what
hes doing

Ahab laughs defiantly scans the awestruck faces of
his crew then stares deep into the crackling light

AHAB
Leap Leap up and lick the
sky I leap with you burn
with you -- I command the
very HEAVENS

A forked light deflects off the harpoon tip casting a

laser beam off at a high angle Ahab turns the harpoon reflecting
the light down -- towards the main mast The

magical beam burns down the length of the mast hitting

the gold doubloon The coin shines brilliantly sparks flickering
out like white sun rays

Controlled by Ahabs harpoon the beam travels down onto Queequegs
face Ishmael and Starbuck recoil back The
harpooners eyes brighten as if he sees an angel

Starbuck can stand no more He dashes over

STARBUCK
No Ahab Dont do this
Enough witchcraft old man
God will turn against you
Tis an ill voyage ill
begun and ill done Stop
this blasphemy Captain --
STOP IT NOW

He seizes his arm to stop him Ahab hurls him away with
inhuman strength He booms at the crew his wide eyes translucent
with maniacal fervor

AHAB
All your oaths shipmates are
AS BINDING AS MINE Make no
mistake Heart body and soul
lungs and life Ahab is BOUND

He lifts the glowing harpoon higher above his head --
its glow intensifies lighting up his whole body

QUEEQUEG
Capn Capn

Ishmael turns in shock Queequeg struggles at the
ropes suddenly and fully conscious his lucid eyes

focused on Ahab Ishmael quickly unties him
Queequeg staggers to Ahab as if hes just seen God

QUEEQUEG (contd)
Queequeg sabeeQueequeg see

He falls to Ahabs feet clutches them worshippingly

QUEEQUEG (contd)
Me Capnme Capnme GOD

Stubb and Flask their faces aglow in Ahabs white
light kneel before him on the pitching windy deck
Dagoo drops to his knees beside Tashtego Fedellah
and the Arabs genuflect prostrate before the master

Removed from it all Ishmael puzzles over this mad
scene He watches Starbuck angry but stricken
fighting all the temptations of the devil

Ahab extends a fatherly hand to Starbuck yearning
for his soul as well

AHAB
Ye see Starbuck My pulse
makes these very planks beat
(to his men)

Look shipmates Raise your
heads Look here as I blow
out your last fear ALL OF
IT GONE

He blows on the flaming white beacon of his harpoon --
the light is extinguished

Above a blinding lightning flash A deafening THUNDER
CRACK

Then darknessas the winds rise and the storm returns
full fury A primordial flooding from both sea and sky

squat on the bow gunwale harpoons in hand eyes
fixed on the horizon with warrior-like intensity

Stubb cons the ship on the wheeldeck puffing his
pipe Flask at the helm Both gaze steadily
seaward with fanatical concentration

uniformly out to sea Zealous sentinels watching
and waiting

sealing the seams with pitch Stubb stands over

with a mock command

hobbles to the bannister and leans down

but can ye tell me where I
shall bewhere HE is at
this very moment

Pip steps anxiously from the cabin decked out in
Ahabs oversized robe A long-absent sight to the
crew Their eyes follow him with strange curiosity

Pip bolts across the deck and crouches at Ahabs
feet fearful of the men the ship the sea all
around He stays close to Ahab for protection

Ignoring the boy Ahab lowers his gaze and scans
the vast expanse

AHAB (contd)
Where is Moby Dick
(up at the sun)
Ye can see him cant ye
My eyes look at the very eye
that even now beholds HIM

Ahab glares down at the quadrant in his hand A
growing disgust spreads across his face

AHAB (contd)
Foolish toy A babys play
thing for commodores What
can ye do but tell me the
poor pitiful point where YOU
happen to be now but not one
jot more than that Ye cant
tell me where one drop of
water will be tomorrow -- or
where be that WHITE WHALE

Pip recoils from Ahabs feet sliding away from him

AHAB (contd)
Youre IMPOTENT -- and with
your impotence you insult
the very SUN
He suddenly raises the quadrant and SMASHES it down
on the deck shattering it into useless pieces

AHAB (contd)
Curse you ye vain paltry
thing Thus I spit on ye
Ill no longer guide my
earthly way by ye

He crushes the broken pieces under his peg leg with
fury then THUNK-CLOPS away

Pip kneels over the quadrant pieces studying them
for meaning like a gypsy reading tea leaves

From all around dumb reactions Then the men go
about their business as if nothing had happened

Narrowing his eyes on Ahab Starbuck rests a hand
over the buckhorn handle of the Bowie knife in his
belt Touching it to muster false courage

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

Swabbing the deck with Ishmael Queequeg smokes his
tomahawk pipe He offers it to Ishmael who takes a
deep pull and hands it back Smiles between them

A distant eerie SOUND distracts them unearthly
WAILS and MOANS from out at sea like the human
cries of lost souls Ishmael squints seaward

ISHMAEL
What could it be Queequeg
Whales

Queequeg shakes his head just as puzzled as he

ISHMAEL (contd)
Sounds like the voices of
drowned men

Others on deck hear it too all eyes focusing out
Looks of nervous forboding

EXT INDIAN OCEAN - DAY

The Pequod slashes through rolling swells flying
all sails and heading true before the wind

She passes an islet of sea-washed rockspopulated
by a colony of seals Sunning on the rocks they
WAIL that eerie human-like CRY As the Pequod
sails by the seals flee into the water

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - DAY

Crewmen watch the seals from the side chuckling
among themselves

EXT BOW DECK - DAY

A distance apart on the port bow Starbuck and
the Captain view the seals Ahab turns to give
Starbuck a half-smile Starbuck doesnt smile
back turning his eyes to the horizon

Ahab sidles over beside him both looking out
He breathes deep sucking in the sea air

AHAB
Tis a mild mild wind is
it not Mister Starbuck
And a mild-lookin sky

He turns away to scan the blue heavens Hard
nervous eyes fixed on his back Starbuck slowly
reaches for the Bowie knife in his belt

AHAB (contd)
On such a mild day as this
I struck my first whale
The knife inches out of Starbucks belt exposing
its long sharp blade Ahabs back is still turned

AHAB (contd)
A boy harpooner of eighteen
Forty years ago Forty years
of whalin of privation and
peril and storms Ayeand
in all those years I have not
spent more than three ashore

The knife is almost out Fighting his conscience
Starbuck wills himself to do it

AHAB (contd)
Forty years of desolation
and solitudewhole oceans
away from that young wife I
wedded and gave a son

The knife freezes in Starbucks grasp as he listens

AHAB (contd)
Did I say WIFE Rather a
WIDOW with her own husband
alive poor girl Her and
that sad neglected spit of
a boymy dear sweet child

Starbuck eases the knife back into his belt too
swayed by decency and compassion Ahab turns to him

AHAB (contd)
Aye Starbuck I widowed ‘em
both With all the madness
frenzy boilin blood and
smokin brow that for a
thousand lowerings I have
chased my preymore a
demon than a man

Starbuck studies Ahabs face trying to understand him
more than hate him Ahabs brow tightens

AHAB (contd)

How richer or better am I
now for all that effort
(his head reels)
I feel deadly faintoh

GOD heal my cracked heart
I feel so old

He leans against Starbuck for support drawing close
to him Starbuck braces him steady

AHAB (contd)
Come close to me Starbuck
let me look into a human eye
Its better than to gaze into
sea or skyor God Himself

Their eyes lock Ahabs gazes deeply into Starbucks

AHAB (contd)
I see my wife and my son in
those eyes Starbuck I see
home in themfaraway home

Genuinely moved by him Starbuck holds him close

STARBUCK
My Captain In these eyes
are MY wife MY children --
and I fear Ill never see
them again

He tightens his grip on him begging earnestly
STARBUCK (contd)
Lets sail away from these
wretched waters Leave right
now sir Let me alter the
course -- head us back to
old Nantucket again

Ahab pulls away dark and stormy again Frustrated
beyond reason Starbuck prays to the sky with clenched
fists

STARBUCK (contd)
Great God in heaven -- SHOW
yourself to this man
Impulsively he yanks out the knife from his belt
STARBUCK (contd)
Or give ME the strength to do
your bidding

He turns toward Ahab his teeth clenched the blade

pointed to strike

Ahab looks at the knife and regards him deeply torn
with new conflicting emotions He stares grimly to sea
as if suddenly realizing his folly

AHAB
What have I done What cruel
master commands me

Starbuck stares at him frozen in step the knife poised

AHAB (contd)
What IS this unearthly thing
pushing me to do what in my own
heart I would not dare

A look of dark revelation his eyes fixed on the far
horizon gazing inward Almost a whisper

AHAB (contd)
Is Ahabno longer Ahab

He screams hysterically after Ahab

PIP

The Blacksmith turns to fuel the huge furnaces
Over the side whaleboats drop -- SLAPPING DOWN

is the first to set off rowing with amazing speed
Ahab climbs over and reacts to Fedallahs flight
He waves his harpoons after him out of his mind

with rage

As if in reply a DEEP RUMBLE of bubbles rises in
the water before them MOBY DICK breaches mightily
with a powerful geyser -- only twenty yards away

He glides past his spray raining over the boat

STARBUCK
God in heaven

He and the others recoil in humbled terror Ahab
leans forward and shouts with demonic triumph

by the heroic horrific scene before him

Ahab rides the whale clinging on his foot and
peg leg supported by impaled harpoons In the

rushing chaos their lines flail around Ahabs
legs and begin to entangle themselves around his
thighs up to his waist

point downward into MOBY DICK again and again
laughing and shouting with hateful exhilaration

MOBY DICK submerges -- taking Ahab down with him

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DAY

Starbuck leaps forward to the bow and leans out
screaming in despair

across his hump with a ravaged face -- wrapped up
in coils and coils of harpoon rope His glazed
eyes wide open in fossilized fury staring
directly at us

exhorting the others with Ahabs own mighty rage

Seizing hold of the taut line he pulls furiously
to drag the boat closer to their prey Shouts back

up in Starbucks fever the others take the lines

Only Ishmael hangs back too petrified to move

his ominous way toward the ship itself

keep his head afloat He sees someone and swims
desperately toward him

Queequeg drifts clinging weakly to a floating oar
The end of his harpoon juts oddly from the water

Ishmael holds onto the oar gasping spitting water

ISHMAEL
Queequeg Hang on mate
Youll be all right

Then he sees the blood in the water Queequegs
harpoon has impaled one side of his waist from
