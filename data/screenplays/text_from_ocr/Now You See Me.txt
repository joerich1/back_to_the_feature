MAY 2009
DREAMLIKE IMAGES OF LAS VEGAS

Float past our eyes Replicas of Coney Island and the
Brooklyn Bridge the kitschy oversized roman ruins at
Caesars Place the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Back in the day magic used to be
downright disreputable It was
practiced in dives and on streets
by tricksters who were regarded as
scarcely better than vagrants and
thieves which they often were
Then sometime during the nineteenth
century all that changed and magic
became the favorite entertainment
in high society parlors all across
Europe and America And magic
became of all things- safe And so
it remains to this day But
tonight all that’s about to

change

MOVE IN on a dazzling marquee that reads- “THE FOUR
HORSEMEN”- the sound of APPLAUSE grows on the SOUNDTRACK and

cuT TO BLACK
NOW YOU SEE ME

A SPOTLIGHT ILLUMINATES MICHAEL ATLAS

A handsome young man wearing jeans and a T-shirt Though he
radiates confidence his tone is humble but it’s hard to
tell if it’s genuine or a put-on

MICHAEL ATLAS
Ladies and gentlemen we’re
delighted to have provided you with
an hour’s divertissement tonight
in this first of our three special
shows But I can’t in good
conscience leave the stage without
acknowledging that we are living in
troubled times

REVERSE ON A HUGE VEGAS AUDIENCE people of all ages and
classes pack the auditorium many nodding in agreement as
Michael continues

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Jobs are harder to come by
Mortgage payments are harder to
make

(MORE)
MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Life is harder than ever while the
crooks- sorry I mean businessmen
and bankers- who made it harder
live high off the hog and laugh it
up at our expense So I think it’s
high time we cut into our share of
the pie

Michael gestures and lights come up on the stage behind him

illuminating THREE MORE YOUNG MEN

RODERIGO SANTAYANA Latino splashy bright clothes

for attention and

a magnet

LONDON OSBORNE actually from London Scowl of a football

hooligan always ready to pick a fight and

ALEX HERO nineteen years old a bright eyed all-American
boy He looks innocent and uses it to his advantage He
scopes out the crowd for pretty girls while Michael steps

closer to the audience

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
-- Tonight the Four Horsemen are
going to make magic dangerous
again We’re going to do something
no one has ever seen on a Vegas
Stage before Or on a stage
anywhere else for that matter

(smiles)

Tonight we’re going to rob a bank
and you are going to help us do it

A SERIES OF LARGE-SCREEN MONITORS lower into place behind the
four magicians as two leggy ASSISTANTS run in from the wings

holding a billowing silken sheet between them

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
I don’t want to be accused of
well faking this so I want
someone from the audience to
volunteer his bank for me Someone
out there have an axe to grind with
their bank

The crowd explodes -- everyone yelling out the names of their
banks- “Omaha Trust” “Kansas National” “B of Al”

Savings”

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
(over the crowd)
Remember your money is insured by
the government
(MORE)

“Pirst
MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
It’s completely safe Or so they
tell us Why don’t we put them to
the test

Michael zeros on one person in particular- we’1ll call him the
MAN FROM PARIS middle-aged mustache natty jacket

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
You sir Where are you from

MAN FROM PARIS
From Paris My bank is the --

LONDON calls out from behind Michael in his Cockney accent

LONDON
Credit Lyonnais

MAN FROM PARIS
That is correct But all of Paris
goes to this bank

MICHAEL ATLAS
Which is exactly why we’re going to
teach them a lesson they’re never
going to forget
(smiles)
Want to give the French something
else to blame us for

The crowd CHEERS

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

All right then Credit Lyonnais it
is Tough one too It’s about
730 in the morning Paris time
isn’t it

(to the Man from Paris)
Why don’t you come on up and give
us a hand Pierre

The four magicians confer on stage as the MONITORS flicker
on displaying the FOUR HORSEMEN graphic as the man from
Paris steps up onto the stage Michael steps over to him and
shakes his hand leading him toward the monitors

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
(to the Man from Paris)
Now I want you to close your eyes
and focus for me Pierre

MAN FROM PARIS
Etienne
MICHAEL ATLAS
Excuse me

MAN FROM PARIS
My name is Etienne

MICHAEL ATLAS

Right Now focus a minute will
you Pierre

(laughter from the

audience)
Concentrate Think about your
bank The branch you go to
Imagine the teller The vault
The vault doors Especially the
vault doors

The Man from Paris closes his eyes as does Michael

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Do you see the bank

MAN FROM PARIS
I see it

The LOGO vanishes off the screen which starts to blink
AN IMAGE takes shape It’s video surveillance footage of the

bank and on cue MELODRAMATIC music begins PLAYING The
audience is enraptured save for

THADDEUS BRADLEY
A grey haired man wearing a beat up old suit that once had

style He snorts derisively at the onstage antics and is
about to take a sip of his WHISKEY AND SODA when

USHER
Excuse me sir you can’t drink in
here

THADDEUS

What do you mean I can’t drink
We’re in Las Vegas aren’t we

USHER
Yes sir but you can’t drink in the
theater You can finish your drink
outside if you

THADDEUS
Oh for crissakes take it will
you
The usher takes the drink from Thaddeus’s hand and heads up
the aisle -- Thaddeus sees the OLD WOMAN next to him giving
him an irritated look he leans over reaches behind her
head and comes out with an IDENTICAL WHISKEY AND SODA He
allows himself a grin

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
Abracadabra Cheers you old cow

And he downs the alcohol while
ON STAGE

Michael Atlas has positioned the Man from Paris in front of
the big screen

MICHAEL ATLAS
Open your eyes Is that your bank

MAN FROM PARIS
I I can’t be sure

MICHAEL ATLAS
Maybe you should take a look around
it then Don’t forget to bring me
back a few euros

Roderigo and Alex Hero step up holding a bright red space-
age JUMPSUIT

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
You’ll be passing through
dimensions which can be dangerous
for the uninitiated This special
suit Roderigo designed will protect
you from harm

Before the guy knows it he is clad in the red jumpsuit and
Michael leads him to the SHIMMERING VEIL the two leggy
assistants are holding up beside the MONITOR SCREEN

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Take a small step for mankind

The man stands there hesitating then he steps forward and
walks into the veil Michael grabs it from the assistants
whirls it around the man’s shape then lets it drop and

The Man from Paris is gone Michael looks confused
Roderigo Santayana steps toward the audience and smiles

RODERIGO
Please do not worry There’s no
problem not one we can’t fix

Michael stands in front of the MONITOR as if dumbfounded

MICHAEL ATLAS
My God ladies and where did
he Pierre can you hear me

MAN FROM PARIS (0S)
Allo

MICHAEL ATLAS
Hello Pierre where are you

ON THE MONITOR the Man from Paris walks into frame he looks
around confused a little scared

MAN FROM PARIS (ON MONITOR)
It’s Etienne And I’m in my
bank I believe I’m in Paris

The crowd strains forward in their seats totally locked in
watching as on the MONITOR the Man from Paris looks around
helplessly

MAN FROM PARIS (ON MONITOR) (CONT’D)
What do I do

MICHAEL ATLAS
I want you to enter the safe

The Man from Paris walks across the bank -- And Michael lays
his hands on the screen as if he is maneuvering the camera
sliding the image so we stay with the Man from Paris He
stops at the SAFE

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Now press your hands against the
safe Concentrate Pierre

The man does it A moment passes then the vault door
clicks

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Now push mon ami Push

ON THE MONITOR The Man from Paris pushes the safe door open
then he walks inside -- There is MONEY everywhere
MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Oh ia la

Michael steps back from the monitor turns to the crowd

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

All zat money just sitting
there Does that seem right to
you

(the AUDIENCE roars “NO”)
Does that seem fair

(NO” again)
Well I’m nothing if not a fair
man Don’t you think we deserve
some of that cash right here

The crowd roars in approval The leggy assistants pick up
the silken veil and begin running around Michael

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Faster faster vite vite

Faster they go until Michael is shrouded by the veil and

The assistants stop running They pull on the veil and then
let it drop and

Michael is gone

ON THE MONITOR The Man from Paris turns looking outside the
safe door -- Then backs away as Michael walks in

Michael turns and looks to camera talking to the crowd
watching him in the Las Vegas theater

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
I believe we all deserve a little
something tonight or is it this
morning

Michael grabs a fistful of EUROS and throws it up in the air
and

IN THE THEATER

MONEY starts to rain down like confetti from the ceiling onto
the crowd many of whom leap up and snatch bills from the
air scramble for the money that has fallen to the floor

THE OLD LADY next to Thaddeus Brady turns to him holding a
few BILLS in her hand
OLD LADY
Is is it real

Thaddeus takes the EUROS from her hand and hands her his
drink -- He studies the bills for a moment then sticks them
in his pocket rises and heads up the aisle obscured by a
shower of falling money

INT GUARD OFFICE - CREDIT LYONNAIS - 850 AM PARIS TIME
THE PHONE RINGS and THE GUARD CAPTAIN answers in French

GUARD CAPTAIN

Hallo No we haven’t opened yet

INT CORRIDOR - CREDIT LYONNAIS - MOMENTS LATER

TWO GUARDS hurry down the hallway toward the VAULT DOOR They
put in dual keys press a code and wait a moment -- Then the
door swings open

guards to cough and gag and we MATCH CUT TO

EXT MGM GRAND HOTEL - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

A ROLLS-ROYCE PHANTOM bursts through the SMOKE rising from an
underground heating vent It rolls out of the parking exit
and turns onto the strip mixing in with the heavy Vegas
traffic

INT ROLLS ROYCE - CONTINUOUS

Michael Atlas dabs at his forehead with a handkerchief
Roderigo sits beside him facing Alex and London Tension is
in the air A silent beat then

ALEX
Did you check out that mad honey in
the third row Aisle seat The
shizzle She was giving me the eye
the whole show too

MICHAEL ATLAS
Which explains why you were late on
half your cues Don’t let it
happen next time
LONDON
Easy tiger Didn’t you see that
audience We killed tonight

MICHAEL ATLAS
Not quite Everyone was slow on
their cues Like doing a show with
the cast of Dawn of the Dead- and
not that new fast-zombie remake
crap either I’m talking classic
slow-ass shambling old-school
zombie shit Lights were a
disaster Were we all in the same
theater

A moment of tense silence between the four men then

RODERIGO
Still we pulled it off didn’t we

Michael allows himself to nod then smile slightly easing
the tension He looks down at his watch

MICHAEL ATLAS
Nine am in Paris

QUICK CUT TO THE VAULT IN THE PARISIAN BANK THE GUARDS rush
in waving away the fumes and see that whatever money was
there is GONE
BACK IN THE ROLLS ROYCE
Michael Atlas leans back finally allowing himself to relax
MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

Tomorrow’s gonna be an interesting

day
EXT SUBURBSOUTER VEGAS - MORNING
The flat desert landscape stretches away beyond the row of
townhouses lining the street The wind blows A TOYOTA
CAMRY is parked outside a modest house engine running

INSIDE THE CAR

DYLAN HOBBES mid-thirties eyes more tired than his years
would suggest looks out at

THE FRONT WINDOW OF THE HOUSE behind which a WOMAN is
visible moving around the kitchen serving breakfast to a
downcast looking LITTLE GIRL

Dylan takes in the tableau for a moment face tensing with
self-recrimination

DYLAN
Damn

He reaches for the car door and we cut to
THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE SWINGING OPEN
To reveal CATHERINE HOBBES glaring at Dylan furiously

CATHERINE
You were supposed to be here at
seven o’clock Last night

DYLAN
I’m sorry Catherine Something
came up at work and

CATHERINE

And you call last minute so I
can’t make any contingency plans
and I miss my meeting with
practically the only clients I have
left

(almost exploding)
You’re not taking her for the
weekend You don’t deserve her

DYLAN
It was an emergency damnit I
don’t work delivering goddamn
pizza If something happens I

Then Dylan catches himself seeing the LITTLE GIRL sitting at
the table beyond Catherine her eyes are on her plate trying
to ignore her parents’ fight

DYLAN (CONT’D)
You’re not keeping me from my
daughter

INT KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

Dylan steps into the sunny space and sits down across from
his morose daughter whose name is HANNA He smiles tightly

DYLAN
Hey baby Sorry I couldn’t make it
last night But I got us all
hooked up for the weekend and-

HANNA
You’re never getting back together
with Mom are you

Dylan is silent caught off guard

HANNA (CONT’D)
What did you do to make her so mad
at you

DYLAN
It’s not what I did It’s what I
didn’t do

Hanna gives no evidence of understanding that

DYLAN (CONT’D)
It’s like school You know how you
have responsibilities Get to
class on time do your homework
talk nice to your teachers You
don’t do those things you get
expelled

HANNA
Mom threw you out because you
didn’t do your homework

DYLAN
Something like that But I think
this weekend I’m going to earn a
little extra credit
(smiles)
We’re going to go to that new water-
park out on 66 Then

Then DYLAN’S CEL-PHONE BUZZES Despite looks from both
Hannah and Catherine who is now in the kitchen doorway
Dylan looks down at the number -- His shoulders slump and he
looks back up at his daughter

DYLAN (CONT’D)
It’s an emergency When it’s over
I’1ll make it up to you That’s a
promise

INT OPERATIONS CENTER - FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

FBI AGENTS are seated around the room The last to enter is
Dylan Hobbes -- still wearing the frustration of his morning
on his face TITLE

FBI Headquarters - Nevada Field Office

The air is filled with early morning banter Standing in
front of a MONITOR is SAC LOUIS HERNANDEZ

HERNANDEZ

Nice of you to join us Agent
Hobbes Alright ladies now that
our star player is here let’s cut
the chatter- we got work to do

(the room quiets down)
Got one for the X-Files people
Our office in Paris called last
night There was a bank robbery
there that took place about 730
am Paris time Approximately
one and a half million euros
disappeared out of the vault of Rue
Rivoli branch of the Credit
Lyonnais The reason we are
talking about it here is this
video taken from the vault

THE IMAGE OF MICHAEL ATLAS and the MAN FROM PARIS comes up on
the screen

HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
This is world famous magician
Michael Atlas The man with him
is as far as we know a member of
the audience from his show When
this image was captured Atlas was
on stage with the Four Horsemen in
the middle of their act at the MGM
Grand

AGENT FULLER a big bear of a man mumbles from the back

AGENT FULLER
You’re saying these guys robbed a
Paris bank -- from Vegas

HERNANDEZ
I’m saying that’s what it looks
like

ON THE MONITOR the audience in the theatre leap and scramble
for the MONEY fluttering down from above

DYLAN
Was it real

HERNANDEZ
Was what real
DYLAN
The money Falling from the
ceiling Was it real or funny
money

HERNANDEZ
From the little we were able to
recover- real as a heart attack

AGENT FULLER
So they pull this thing off and
don’t even keep the score Who are
these guys

DYLAN
More pertinently- where are they

HERNANDEZ
They’re staying in the Excelsior
Hotel Got the entire top floor
rented out We called and they’re
there So they don’t appear to be
particularly worried about all
this

Another AGENT stands

ALMA VARGAS
attitude stands

AGENT
Well what are we waiting for

HERNANDEZ
For Inspector Alma Vargas of the
Las Vegas Special Investigation
Unit to brief us so we know
exactly what we’re dealing with
She’1l be liaising with us on this
case Inspector

a beautiful young detective with a caustic
aware of the instant attention she commands

from all the men in the room not necessarily for the things
she wants to be noticed for She’s used to it
a remote and an image of THE FOUR HORSEMEN appears on the

MONITOR

ALMA VARGAS
The Four Horsemen are like a magic
superhero team Each one of them
was an established magician in his
own right before they joined
forces for what they’re billing as
three special shows over the span
of ten days

(MORE)

Alma presses

ALMA VARGAS (CONTD)
Last night being the first Friday

DYLAN
-Wow You read the brochure How
did you manage to do all this
“research” Inspector

ALMA VARGAS
Police officers in Vegas are used
to working late hours Unlike FBI
agents apparently

Alma weathers the chorus of boos and jeers that greet her
enjoying it then continues

ALMA VARGAS (CONT’D)
I’m not done yet Allow me to drop
a little more wisdom on you We’1l1
start with Santayana

A MONTAGE of IMAGES BEGINS as she talks starting on a SMALL
LATINO BOY wandering wide eyed through a small town traveling

ALMA VARGAS (VO) (CONT’D)
Real name Alexander Hess Ail

less about baseball What he’s
into is magic Sleight of hand to
be specific

Alex throws the ball into the glove again then smiles and
opens the glove-the ball has disappeared We widen out to
see ALEX IS ON STAGE in a television studio a neon logo
behind him reads “AMERICA’S GOT SKILLZ”

ALMA VARGAS (VO) (CONTD)

So you want your money’s worth

IMAGE OF THE CLUBBER in an emergency room with his broken
glass sticking out of his mouth as the doctors struggle to
remove it without killing him

ALMA VARGAS (V0O)
Weird thing is no one there could
remember if Osborne did it or the
guy did to himself In any case
Osborne served three years for
aggravated assault It’s toward
the end of that time that the Four
Horsemen came together

LONDON sits in front the protective glass in a PRISON
VISITING ROOM

HERNANDEZ
Thank you officer Vargas Good

DYLAN
Yeah wow none of us know how to
access Wikipedia

DYLAN (CONTD)

Thank you so much

(looks up from his I-

PHONE )
In the meantime while you were
regaling us with that informative
yet banal information I tracked
down the credit card number of the
guy from the audience who was in
the vault with Atlas Remember
him His name is Etienne Glickman
and he used the same card to rent a
room at the Hard Rock for six
nights Tonight being his last

(smiles)
Think it might be a good idea to
talk to him before he splits town

EXT HARD ROCK HOTELCASINO - DAY - AN HOUR LATER

A phalanx of UNMARKED POLICE cars pull into the driveway and
POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS fling the doors open and rush
out

INT UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

Not an applicable saying in this
instance Anyway cops make
collars we solve cases Knock

Alma gives Dylan a disgusted look then gets out of the car
and heads toward the hotel entrance Dylan watches her back
admiringly as

AGENT FULLER
Collars are for dogs Did you
actually say that

DYLAN
I caught myself

AGENT
Like that shit you followed up with

DYLAN
She’s into me

EXT VILLA - OUTER VEGAS - DAY

A CADILLAC SEVILLE pulls into a driveway and THADDEUS
BRADLEY- the acerbic older man we last saw at the magic show-
gets out of the car He sees the arm on his mailbox is up
so he reaches for the latch then

FIREWORKS EXPLODE OUT OF THE MAILBOX with a BANG causing him
to jump backward RECORDED LAUGHTER comes from within the
mailbox like the laughter at the end of Michael Jackson’s
“Thriller” Thaddeus sighs Clearly this kind of thing
happens to him often

INT LIVING ROOM - THADDEUS’S VILLA - LATER

Thaddeus at the bar mixing himself a MARTINI while in fg
the TELEVISION IS ON we hear the NEWS-REPORT

NEWSCASTER (TV)
-- Authorities are responding to
reports that the French bank
purportedly robbed during the Four
Horsemens performance at the MGM
grand was in fact actually
robbed

Thaddeus steps into the room sipping his drink The place
is a shrine to himself posters and pictures of him
everywhere most prominent being a FOX TV SHOW poster of
Thaddeus standing beneath a logo that reads “MAGIC’S
GREATEST SECRETS EXPOSED”

NEWSCASTER (TV) (CONT’‘D)
-- Which if true has many experts
saying is the most daring feat of
magic since the heyday of Harry
Houdini himgelf

ON THE TV we see images the FOUR HORSEMEN exiting their hotel
surrounded by a phalanx of COPS FBI AGENTS and NEWS-MEDIA

NEWSCASTER (TV) (CONT’D)
-- The media firestorm has made the
Horsemen at least for today the
most famous act in show business

CLOSE ON THADDEUS his features tightening with agitation as
he watches the tube

NEWSCASTER (TV) (CONT’D)
-- The guestion on everyone’s mind
now are they going to enjoy their
fame as free men or behind bars

cur TO

A ROW OF VIDEO MONITORS

Each one showing a separate INTERROGATION ROOM in which one
of the Four Horsemen is being held The images turn from blue
to red measuring temperature Blood pressure Pulse
There are all kinds of fluctuations happening on the screen
for ROOM 1 where young ALEX HERO hands cuffed is being
shoved into a seat by AGENT FULLER

ALEX (ON MONITOR)
Yo Pooh Bear why you got to be
iike that None of the others got
cuffed and shit

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 1 - CONTINUOUS
Agent Fuller steps away from Alex watched by Dylan and Alma

AGENT FULLER

That’s cause none of the others
called me cute nicknames Vanilla
Ice Besides you’re supposed to
be the sleight of hand artist
aren’t you

(grins )
So why don’t you work your way out
of those cuffs yourself Be a nice
trick

ALEX
I’m not giving you any excuses to
mess my ass up

AGENT FULLER
Agent Hobbes and detective Vargas
are right here no one’s gonna do
anything to you You want those
off do it yourself

Alex takes a moment then

ALEX
Okay But I’d like to give them
back to you Would you put your
hands on the table for me please

Agent Fuller takes a beat then he leans over and puts his
hands on the table

AGENT FULLER
This better be

Alex snatches Agent Fuller’s hands then slams them back down
on the table in a single dizzyingly quick motion and

Dylan and Alma reflexively step forward then stop as they
see that

Agent Fuller is now wearing the handcuffs on his own wrists

Agent Fuller glares at Alex then reaches his cuffed hands to
his pocket fishing around in there but

ALEX
Lost something Kind of sloppy for
an FBI agent aren’t you Pooh
Bear
(turns to Alma)
You started on that soda yet
miss

ALMA
Vargas Detective Vargas to you
(raises the unopened CAN
OF DIET COKE in her hand)
Nope

ALEX
Feels a little heavy for a diet
beverage doesn’t it

Alma’s eyes narrow She shakes the diet coke can- there is a
clinking sound from inside it She peels the cap off then
walks over to the table and turns it over letting the soda
spill onto the interrogation table until a SINGLE KEY drops
out of the hole and clinks onto the table top

ALEX (CONT’D)
Hookers do tricks Next time you
want to see magic buy a ticket to
the show

The three law enforcement officers look at Alex with newfound
respect in their eyes He’s young but clearly a formidable
opponent

ALMA VARGAS
Don’t plan on leaving town any time
soon Mr Hero

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 2 - LATER
Roderigo Santayana shakes his head

RODERIGO
-- Of course we’re going to leave
town We have a show in Atlantic
City Friday night If we had
reason to run we would have already
been gone no On what grounds do
think you can keep us here

Dylan and Vargas sit in front of Roderigo Agent Fuller in
the bg

DYLAN
You know very well on what grounds
This is some serious shit you’re in
Mr Santayana You’re not on stage
anymore

RODERIGO
No Then what is this little
“interrogation room” of yours
Lights gadgets Lie detectors
heat sensors You even have a two-
way mirror A room that conveys a
sense of privacy yet there’s at
least a dozen people listening to
our every word You put on your
shows too Mr FBI I’1l put on
mine

DYLAN
You crossed the line into my show
when you robbed a bank-

RODERIGO
In Paris While we were in Las
Vegas

Alma Vargas is holding another can of diet coke She shakes
it hears nothing so she peels off the cap and takes a sip

DYLAN
Just ‘cause you were in Vegas
doesn’t mean you didn’t have
confederates over there in Paris
while-

RODERIGO
Confederates You have the bank
video You saw what everyone else
saw

DYLAN
Which was Michael Atlas and a
member- purported- member of your
audience in the vault In Paris

RODERIGO
Which is impossible of course
(smiles)
You think I built a transporter
like in a science fiction movie
I’m good but no one is that good

ALMA VARGAS
Right Mr Santayana Which is why
we’re here And why we’re gonna
stay here until you give us an
explanation

Roderigo takes a moment then shrugs his shoulders

RODERIGO
Coincidence

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 3 - LATER
Dylan is looking a little more pissed off now as he snaps

DYLAN
-- That’s your story after the
shit you pulled Coincidence

London Osborne is sitting across table from Dylan and Alma
Vargas His dark eyes burn his temper always in check

LONDON
Good a story as any oi Has the
benefit of being the truth as
well

DYLAN
And you expect me to buy that

LONDON
Yes

DYLAN
That’s it The whole great
mentalist shtick- Just look someone
in the eye and lie to them You
expect that bullshit to work on me

LONDON
Why not You expect it to work on
your wife don’t you

Dylan freezes The tension in the air is suddenly palpable

LONDON (CONT’D)
What’s her name

DYLAN
I’m not telling you my wife’s name

LONDON

Not your wife The name of the
bird you were out with the other
night when you told your wife you
were working late so you couldn’t
make it on time to pick up your own
kid -- What was her name

(eyes gleaming)
Or don’t you even remember it
There‘ve been so many haven’t

Dylan snaps across the table grabbing London by the collar
London just stares into Dylan’s eyes not moving a muscle
and

Dylan relents stepping back aware of the eyes of Alma and
Agent Fuller on him London sits back down in his chair

LONDON (CONT’D)
Coincidence I’d leave it at that
if I were you But because I know
you won’t I’1ll simply remind you-

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 4 - LATER

Michael Atlas sits comfortably in his chair in his t-shirt
and jeans

MICHAEL ATLAS
-- My lawyers are better than your
lawyers Better paid better
dressed and better prepared Which
is what it’s all about isn’t it
Preparation We’re prepared
You’re not Which is why despite
your tiresome threats to the
contrary we are going to walk out
of here free of charges

Dylan Alma and Agent Fuller glare at Michael All looking
they’ve had it up to here with these guys

DYLAN
You are one cocky son of a bitch
aren’t you In fact you are a
quartet of cocky sons of bitches

MICHAEL ATLAS
That’s why we get paid the big
bucks

ALMA VARGAS
So what did you need the money for
Why risk everything on a stunt like
this

MICHAEL ATLAS
You seem to be forgetting we don’t
have the money

ALMA VARGAS
Not all of it But hardly any of
the cash that fell on that audience
in your little Robin Hood bit was
recovered You could have kept the
lion’s share for yourselves for
all we know

Michael turns his eyes on Alma studies her carefully

MICHAEL ATLAS
It’s clear detective Vargas that
all you know does not amount to
very much There’s no way to tie
the money we- donated- with the
money from the bank Unless you
can put me in that vault you’ve
got nothing

ALMA VARGAS
We have Etienne Glickman

Michael raises his eyebrows as if to ask- “Who”

ALMA VARGAS (CONT’D)
The “audience member” you brought
up onto the stage Your plant

MICHAEL ATLAS

Plant The little French guy You
don’t know the first thing about
magic do you What good could he
possibly have been to me as plant

(smiles)
Obviously you haven’t questioned
him yet I wish I could be there
for that one I haven’t had a good
laugh in a while

AGENT FULLER
You should check out Jerry at the
Sands It’s a goddam laugh riot

MICHAEL ATLAS
So I’ve heard But I’ma
compulsive workaholic It’s a
failing of mine So unless you
have a better hand than the one
you’ve been showing I’d like to
get out of here and start
rehearsals for our next show

INT OPERATIONS ROOM - FBI HEADQUARTERS - HOURS LATER

Dylan Alma Agent Fuller and several others are sitting
around surrounded by empty fast food containers looking
beat A RE-RUN of Michael Atlas’s interrogation is playing
on a monitor One of the agents groans

FBI AGENT
I can’t watch this again What a
prick

DYLAN

They were all pricks Like they
were trying to piss us off on
purpose

AGENT FULLER
Nothing like rock stars though
Remember when we had to bring in
U2 Now those guys took it toa
whole other level of prickness
ALMA VARGAS
Prickishness

AGENT FULLER
What

ALMA VARGAS
You said “prickness” That’s not a
word The word is “prickishness”

AGENT FULLER
Whoa Sorry to have blundered into
your area of expertise

ON THE MONITOR Michael Atlas grins and says

MICHAEL ATLAS (ON MONITOR)
-- You don’t know the first thing
about magic do you

VOICE He’s right of course You people
really don’t know the first thing
about magic

Every head in the room turns to see
THADDEUS BRADLEY
Standing in the doorway of the operations room

THADDEUS
-- But I do I trust you’ll excuse
me for letting myself in
unannounced

AGENT FULLER
Who the hell are you

ALMA VARGAS
Thaddeus Bradley Probably the
most hated magician on the planet

THADDEUS
My reputation precedes me Still
“Hate” might be too strong a word

ALMA VARGAS
Actually considering how many
sneaky vindictive weirdos do hate
you I’m amazed you’re still alive

DYLAN
Am I missing something here You
know this guy

ALMA VARGAS
Only from TV -- And Wikipedia
(turns to Dylan)
I work entertainment in Las Vegas
agent Hobbes It’s my job to know
who’s who in town so that when
something like this goes down not
everyone is playing catch up
(then)
-Even if it is at the expense of a
less exciting social life

Agent Fuller winces for Dylan as Alma rises and walks to the
coffee machine

ALMA VARGAS (CONT’D)
Thaddeus Bradley has been exposing
other magicians’ secrets for years
Embarrassed them really Nickname
is the career killer He even had
a low rated Fox Show for short
spell where he

THADDEUS
The ratings were fine The network
simply didn’t know where to place
it Not to mention my books two
of which sat on the New York Times
non-fiction best seller list for
months

AGENT FULLER
Whatever What I want to know is-
what the hell are you doing here

THADDEUS

Isn’t it obvious

(then)
I’ve seen countless people try to
figure out the mechanisms of
countless tricks -- Your faces are
not exactly flushed with the thrill
of success

Dylan shakes off his anger at Alma’s jibe and faces
Thaddeus

DYLAN
We’ll figure it out
THADDEUS
It’ll take time Time you don’t
have The clock is on Three
shows in ten days- what you saw was
merely the warm up act

AGENT FULLER
And you know this because-

THADDEUS
I know show business The magic
business in particular And
because I know Michael Atlas
(pauses)

He was my student Perhaps my
brightest But everything he
knows he learned from me

DYLAN
And what’s in this for you

THADDEUS

Isn’t that obvious as well

(no answer)
Relevance

(gathers himself)
I want my name mentioned in every
press conference you give about
this case and when it’s solved
and the Four Horsemen are behind
bars I want to be given the credit
for breaking it That’s what’s in
it for me

AGENT FULLER
The FBI doesn’t work with circus
freaks

THADDEUS
When in Rome

DYLAN

I’ll run it by brass Leave your
information and we’ll contact you
But before you do that given the
day I’ve had I want you to know
one thing

(pauses)
If you point your finger at my
pocket and I reach in there and
find your card I swear on my
mother I will shoot you where you
stand

EXT AIRPORT TARMAC —- NIGHT

A LEAR JET THUNDERS OVERHEAD -- Touching down on the tarmac
and we cut to

THE FOUR HORSEMEN exiting their private jet luggage in hand
They walk toward a BLACK LIMOUSINE waiting for them nearby

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

THE LIMOUSINE glides toward the lights of ATLANTIC CITY
glittering in the near distance we hear on the SOUNDTRACK

RADIO DJ (V0)

-- Let’s cut to the chase I know
you’re never gonna tell us how you
did it or even if you did it

INT RADIO STATION BOOTH - MORNING

The FOUR HORSEMEN are seated around an interview table
facing the excitable young DJ who continues

RADIO DJ
-- So the question I have to ask
you is- Are you gonna do it again

London Osborne leans toward his mic and smiles

LONDON
Come see our show Friday night and
find out

ALEX
Word I’11l be doing my song too
from my new album- “Alex Hero
steals your Heart”- so bum rush it
ladies

WE SEE A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AS THE INTERVIEW CONTINUES ON THE
SOUNDTRACK -- Dozens of RADIO STATION PHONE OPERATORS taking
CALLS typing in names and addresses into their computers

RADIO DJ (VO)

The tickets to this show are being
picked by random lottery and are
completely free isn’t that right

LONDON (V0)

That’s right Gift to our fans
from the Horsemen and our sponsors
the good people at Stonebridge
Life

LOTTERY BALLS WITH NAMES ON THEM FLY around inside an AIR
CHAMBER on a local MORNING SHOW -- Alex Hero reaches in and
snatches out ball after ball watched by the show’s HOSTS

RADIO DJ (V0)

We have two hundred seats available
for our listeners right here so
call in if you want to see this
incredible -- event I’m not sure
you can even call it just a “magic
show” anymore

A COMPUTER IMAGE OF A THEATER SEATING PLAN fills the screen
as SEAT AFTER SEAT IS FILLED UP turning from blue to red

RADIO DJ (VO) (CONT’D)
Some call you illusionists some
call you magicians now some are
calling you criminals What do you
have to say about that

THE COMPUTER IMAGE DISSOLVES into a HIGH ANGLE of the ACTUAL
AUDITORIUM filled with empty red seats -- A LONE FIGURE
steps onto the dark stage becoming recognizable as MICHAEL
ATLAS

MICHAEL ATLAS (V0O)
Aman was nailed to a cross once
Killed in broad daylight by the
powers that be He was laid to
rest inside of a dark cave and the
entrance was covered over with a
rock Three days later he was
gone

DOLLY IN ON MICHAEL as he takes in the dark theater

MICHAEL ATLAS (VO) (CONT’D)
It took Jesus three days to get out
of an escape proof vauit and they
said he was the son of God TI can
do it three minutes -- So what does
that make me

EXT FBI HEADQUARTERS - LAS VEGAS —- DAY

CAMERA MOVES TOWARD an upper floor WINDOW as we hear DYLAN’S
VOICE

DYLAN (V0)
Son of a bitch

INT SECTION CHIEF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Dylan Alma Vargas and Agent Fuller are standing in front of
SAC Hernandez Dylan fumes

DYLAN
-- I’ve never seen a guiltier bunch
of perps in my life and we let
them fly off to Atlantic city just
like that

HERNANDEZ

Then make the case Right now all
they’re guily of is being a bunch
of cocky bastards

(angry)
They don’t have to prove they
didn’t do it We have to prove
they did Our job is harder and
it pays less Way of the world

(then)
What about their staff
Stagehands Employees

DYLAN
We have whatever personnel we can
spare on it but-

ALMA VARGAS
Cogs in a machine The Horsemen
employ dozens of people at any
given show each person seems to
know just enough to allow them to
do their job Maybe somebody’s
wise to something but I doubt it
And magic people are a tight lipped
bunch as it is I doubt we’ll get
far Certainly not in three days

HERNANDEZ
So that’s it That’s all you got

AGENT FULLER
We still got the French guy

HERNANDEZ
Not for long Got a call from the
State Department Either you pin
something on him that can stick or
he’s on tonight’s flight back to
the land of frog legs and cheese

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

ETIENNE GLICKMAN exhausted and irate is sitting opposite
the table from Alma who is alone in the room with him

ETIENNE GLICKMAN
I told you once I told you twice
I’1l tell you an ‘undred times I
was in the theater here in Las
Vegas yes They call me to the
stage they wrap me in a fabric
and suddenly I am in a small room
with a nice couch where I am
served coffee and cakes by a pretty
girl Not as pretty as you but
pretty enough-

ALMA VARGAS
I’m sure she was Go on Mr
Glickman

ETIENNE GLICKMAN
After a few minutes the lights are
turned off and I find myself back
on the stage next to Mr Atlas
Money is falling everywhere
everyone is going mad and no one
cares about me anymore Finis

Alma turns to a MONITOR on which video from the Parisian bank
vault is playing

ALMA VARGAS
Are you saying that is not you

ETIENNE GLICKMAN
Yes I mean it looks like me but
it is not me I don’t even
remember the last time I went into
the bloody bank I only use the
ATM

ALMA VARGAS
We ran a scan on your voice from
the tape Mr Glickman and it
matches up as well

INT OBERSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dylan and Agent Fuller and several others are watching on a
monitor outside the interrogation room

ETIENNE GLICKMAN (ON MONITOR)
It’s a trick no Do you think I
really traveled through dimensions
That is what these people do- magic
tricks I’m a law abiding man
it’s not my job to know how they do
these things If you are too
stupid to figure it out it’s not
my problem

Dylan and Agent Fuller turn away from the monitor look at
each other They know what they have to do

AGENT FULLER
Shit

INT THEATER - MGM GRAND - NIGHT

THADDEUS BRADLEY walks into the auditorium where Dylan Agent
Fuller and Alma are waiting standing near the empty stage

THADDEUS
My name Correctly pronounced
every time a press conference is
given Correctly spelled in every
press release And credit for

DYLAN
For “breaking the case” Done
But the case has to get broken
first

THADDEUS

And the reason for meeting in such
theatrical environs

AGENT FULLER
You’re going to show us how they
pulled it off right

THADDEUS

And you think anything on this
stage or auditorium had anything to
do with it

(sighs)
You really are an organization of
rubes aren’t you I’m surprised
anyone ever gets caught at all

DYLAN
Are you breaking some kind of
magician’s code if you aren’t
acting like a complete asshole
(MORE)

DYLAN (CONTD)
(steps close to Thaddeus)

You don’t start coming up with the
goods right now I’m gonna call
the IRS and have them back audit
you for every fiscal year of your
goddamn pathetic life How’s that
for a trick

Thaddeus locks eyes with Dylan -- Not someone to be trifled
with either Then

THADDEUS
The first mistake one could make
would be to assume that the robbery
actually occurred on the night of
the performance -- when it
happened some seventy six hours
earlier With the preparations for
it taking up at least the better
part of the week on the streets of
Paris

IMAGE OF MICHAEL ATLAS RODERIGO AND LONDON OSBORNE walking
through the crowded throng on the CHAMPS ELYSEES blending in
with minimal disguises a baseball hat sunglasses etc

AGENT FULLER (VO)
We might be rubes but we’re not
stupid That’s the first thing we
checked The Horsemen haven’t left
the country in months And-

THADDEUS (V0O)
And fake passports are so hard to
pull off

BACK TO DYLAN Shaking his head

DYLAN
They are these days

THADDEUS
Well that would be your area of
expertise more than mine wouldn’t
it Agent Hobbes I am simply here
to tell you that somehow it was
accomplished and-

DYLAN
Uh uh They’ve been here in Vegas
rehearsing their show for the past
few weeks There are plenty of
witnesses who saw them every day

IMAGES OF MEMBERS OF THE HORSEMEN in various locations seen
from the POV’s OF NEARBY SPECTATORS RODERIGO rehearsing
the gears of a gimmick on-stage LONDON OSBORNE walking
purposefully through a casino mall MICHAEL ATLAS getting
takeout at a restaurant waving to a fan

THADDEUS (VO)
Taik to the those witnesses again
Ask them if they saw more than one
of the Horsemen at a time and how
close they got to them

AGENT FULLER (VO)
Youre saying one of these guys
stayed behind and disguised himself
as the other guys for an alibi

THADDEUS (VO)
Is that so difficult to conceive
Speaking of which did you enjoy
your interrogation of that poor
French fellow What was his name

ALMA VARGAS (VO)
Glickman Etienne Glickman

IMAGES OF ETIENNE GLICKMAN walking blithely through the
street in PARIS -- RODERIGO is following him snapping photos
with a powerful POCKET CAMERA ALSO SNAPPING PHOTOS OF
SEVERAL OTHER MEN HE IS SHADOWING

THADDEUS (V0O)
Tickets for the Horsemen’s shows
are sold long in advance In
August there are plenty of French
tourists in Vegas I imagine they
advertised heavily on the streets
of Paris all of July

IT’S TRUE As Roderigo follows a man in the metro he passes
a large BILLBOARD for the FOUR HORSEMEN on the wall of the
station

THADDEUS (VO) (CONT’D)
-- They checked the names on the
eredit card reservations from
Paris then followed those men
photographed several of them to be
safe in case of a cancellation and
ereated make-up for each one

THE PHOTOS OF FIVE FRENCH MEN- ETIENNE GLICKMAN AMONG THEM-
ADORN A WALL below which a pair of dextrous HANDS prepares
rubber molds and fake hair for disguises

THADDEUS (VO) (CONT’D)
-- The make-up would oniy need to
be minimally suggestive given the
quality of the security camera
image On the night of the robbery
they repeated their little act for
the camera three or four times with
several different make-ups and
used the tape of Mr Glickman only
when they saw he was at the show

AGENT FULLER (VO)
Wait a minute That doesn’t wash
Even with make-up how would they
know what he’d be wearing on the
night of the show

THADDEUS (VO)
They couldn’t of course Why do
you think they put him in that
ridiculous red jumpsuit before
“transporting” him You didn’t
think it was actually for-

ALMA VARGAS (VO)
Traveling through dimensions No
we did not Mr Bradley Please
continue

IMAGES OF ETIENNE GLICKMAN BEING WRAPPED IN THE JUMPSUIT --
then of SOMEONE DISGUISED AS HIM in the security camera
footage wearing the red jumpsuit -- then the same thing
repeated with several different “disguises”

THADDEUS (V0O)
The first thing to look for in any
illusion is what is essential and
what is not Anything that isn’t
disguised as showmanship is there
for a very specific purpose In
this case the red jumpsuit was put
on to cover the clothing its
garishness to draw attention from
the face and the hastily applied
make-up

DYLAN (V0)
Why bother with the whole French
guy schtick in the first piace

THADDEUS (VO)
To make the illusion real To make
the audience and you think what
they were seeing was taking place
then and there

ALMA VARGAS (VO)
What about the voice match

IMAGE OF MICHAEL ATLAS standing next to ETIENNE GLICKMAN at a
bistro as he orders a coffee -- IN MICHAEL’S SHOULDER BAG is
a RECORDING DEVICE

DYLAN (V0)
That wouldnt be much of a problem
If they were tailing these guys
they could’ve easily recorded their
voices and cut something together
later

AGENT FULLER (VO)
What I want to know is how did
they get him to vanish off the
stage like that

BACK IN THE THEATER Dylan and Alma turn and look at Fuller
with raised eyebrows

AGENT FULLER (CONT’D)
(defensive)
What

THADDEUS
For questions like that I refer you
to the box set of the first season
of my show-

ALMA VARGAS
There only was one season

THADDEUS
-Available for thirty nine ninety
five on Amazon or on my website
Am I here to teach you parlor
tricks or help you solve a crime

DYLAN
Which you said happened seventy two
hours earlier How did you come up
with that number

IMAGE OF THE FRENCH GUARDS opening the vault door running
inside only to cough and gag at the FUMES in the air

THADDEUS (VO)
Tf you examine the vauit with those
scientific instruments you people
are so proud of I believe youll
find traces of dioxide
hydrosulfate Known colioquiaily in
my circles as “Vanishing Juice”

IMAGES OF HUGE WADS OF EUROS being doused in a chemical bath

THADDEUS (VO) (CONT’D)
When paper of a certain make is
treated with it it instigates a
chemical reaction that causes
complete disintegration
accompanied by rather noxious
fumes exactly eighty hours later
Like milk curdiing on a dime
Illusionists have been using it for
centuries The thing is you have
to time your gag just right or you
might miss the moment

IN THE VAULT WE SEE MICHAEL ATLAS and the disguised MAN FROM
PARIS replacing the EUROS that are there with different Euros
from their own bags

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
They made counterfeit cash out of
this paper- and Ill thank you not
to ask me how counterfeit cash is
made They treated it several
hours before entering the vault
then switched it with the real
money so that no one would notice
anything was missing In the
minimum time remaining they escaped
with the real cash made it to
Vegas and on-stage in time for the
show They do their bit the
guards in Paris fling open the
vault door and on cue- pffff There
must have been a lot of Credit
Lyonnais customers wondering what
was happening in their wallets that
morning

IMAGES of FUMES POURING FROM PARISIANS’ POCKETS -- WALLETS
SMOKING in people’s hands CASH DISSOLVING IN FRONT OF THEIR
EYES

DYLAN (V0O)
They still had to rob that bank

BACK TO THADDEUS He turns to Dylan and sighs

THADDEUS
Which is again your area of
expertise You are going to earn
some of your meager salary aren’t
you Agent Hobbes

ALMA VARGAS
You say the Horsemen didn’t know
which guy from the audience they
would use until the last minute
Yet the bank’s tape showed Michael
Atlas and Etienne Glickman in the
vault That means someone had to
be there at the time of the
performance to put that tape in
their system Which means they had
an accomplice on the inside

DYLAN
The French cops ran polygraphs on
the bank guards They all passed
with flying colors

THADDEUS
(to Alma)
Not bad detective I believe you
to be correct But it was not
necessarily a willing accomplice
Or should I say a conscious one

IMAGE OF THE BANK GUARD CAPTAIN receiving a phone call the
scene we saw earlier right after the performance

GUARD CAPTAIN
Hallo No we haven’t opened yet
(listens)
From Las Vegas In America That’s
ridiculous

CUT TO LONDON OSBORNE on his cel-phone walking toward the
LIMOUSINE in the MGM GRAND PARKING AREA where the other
Horsemen are waiting for him

LONDON (INTO PHONE)
(In French)
Pineapple You understand

GUARD CAPTAIN (ON PHONE)
of course JI understand Right
away

IN THE BANK SECURITY OFFICE The GUARD CAPTAIN now looking
somewhat dazed hangs up the phone Walks to a drawer nearby
opens it and finds a TAPE waiting for him He picks it up
moves to the BANK OF MONITORS and pops out the OLD TAPE

DYLAN (V0)
Okay Heres where I draw the
line

BACK IN THE MGM THEATER Dylan is shaking his head he’s
heard enough

DYLAN (CONT’D)
-- You want me to believe that some
guy could be hypnotized days in
advance to respond to a code word
like something out of “The
Manchurian Candidate” I thought
you exposed tricks man

THADDEUS
Mentalism- guessing the future and
the card in your hand and all that-
depends on tricks Hypnotism is
the real deal

IMAGE OF LONDON OSBORNE disguised as a repair-man talking
earnestly to the GUARD CAPTAIN OF THE BANK behind them we
SEE ALEX HERO slipping past unseen sliding a TAPE INTO A

DRAWER in the back

THADDEUS (VO) (CONT’D)
-- Practiced by an expert it’s an
extremely potent method of inducing
its subject to action Especially
action which falls within the scope
of the subject’s usual patterns

BACK TO THADDEUS We move in his darkly intelligent eyes his
voice soft

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
You referred to us as “circus
freaks” as I recall So I will
tell you this-

(pauses)

London Osborne is the best at what
he does Much as I dislike these
boys they all are Their next
show is in less than forty eight
hours

(MORE)

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
Were I in your shoes I would not
make the mistake of underestimating
them

dialing again but doesn’t He walks over to where ALMA
VARGAS is waiting

ALMA VARGAS

DYLAN
My wife- ex-wife- hangs up when she
sees my number If I catch her off-
guard I can usually talk my way
into a conversation with my little
girl

Alma studies Dylan then looks out at the crowd shaking her
head

ALMA VARGAS
It’s like Beatlemania or something
(then)
(MORE)

ALMA VARGAS (CONTD)
You think Thaddeus is right That

they’re going to try it again

DYLAN
That’s why we’re here isn’t it

THADDEUS BRADLEY is visible across the hotel lobby talking
to the concierge

ALMA VARGAS
Do you trust him

DYLAN
Not sure Which is why we brought
him here but didn’t give him
anything to do I’m gonna shadow
him- see if he leads us to water
You wait for the Horsemen to come
down stay on them from the minute
they leave the hotel -- Got Fuller
and the others situated between
here and the theater

Alma nods but Dylan doesn’t leave there is some
electricity in the air between them

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Listen detective Varg Alma
Since joining the bureau I haven’t
well interfaced with LVPD not
since I was a cop myself I just
want you to know that well-

ALMA VARGAS
Do you really need it Agent
Hobbes

DYLAN
Need what

ALMA VARGAS
Another excuse not to spend time
with your daughter

Dylan is stung silent Then his eyes shift as he sees

THADDEUS BRADLEY buttoning up his jacket and exiting the
hotel through a side door heading out into the street

Dylan turns without another word and follows after Bradley
HOLD ON ALMA

Feeling she might have gone too far and we cut to

EXT PARADISE THEATER —- ATLANTIC CITY - EVENING

A HUGE CROWD is gathered beneath the marquee which reads
STONEBRIDGE LIFE presents THE FOUR HORSEMEN -- AGENT FULLER
scans the area and speaks into his CEL-PHONE

AGENT FULLER
Yo Dylan Hours before showtime
and there’s already a huge freakin’
crowd here We’re in the wrong
business You on the old freak

EXT ATLANTIC CITY MALL - CONTINUOUS

Dylan is moving through the densely crowded space keeping
distance between himself and Thaddeus he whispers into his
ear-piece

DYLAN (ON PHONE)

Yeah- But this guy has eyes in the

back of his head Try not to

Hold on I’ve got a text Damn

Cathy busting my balls for calling

Hanna and-

Dylan looks up- he was just distracted for an instant- but
his face fills with concern

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Shit I’ve lost him Shit

AGENT FULLER (ON PHONE)
What do you mean lost him

DYLAN
I mean he’s gone I will call you
back Shit Shit

Dylan hurries into the crowd looking in every direction
trying at the same time not to make himself too conspicuous
the sound of the crowd growing louder and louder and we make
a hard cut to

INT LOBBY BAR - TRUMP HOTEL —- AN HOUR LATER

Silence Alma sits on a stool at the bar nursing a half-
finished DIET-COKE Sips at it Calls to the BARTENDER

ALMA VARGAS
Excuse me- this soda is kinda flat

BARTENDER
You been working on it for a while

She starts to answer when the SWEATY BUSINESSMAN next to her
gets his courage up enough to make conversation

BUSINESSMAN
In town for the show right

ALMA VARGAS
Excuse me

BUSINESSMAN
For the magic show Or just here
to try your luck

ALMA VARGAS
Little bit of both

BUSINESSMAN
Robin Hoods right
(Alma raises an eyebrow)
Steal from the rich right Why
should those scumbags have it all
right Spread the goods Socialism
my ass Spread it around right

Alma doesn’t know what to answer- then there is a TREMENDOUS
SHOUT from outside and she turns to see

THE FOUR HORSEMEN exiting the elevator into the lobby
flanked by a PHALANX OF SECURITY they move toward the front
doors as the excited crowd outside presses in towards them

ALMA VARGAS

-- The Four Horsemen getting a
reception usually reserved for rock
stars prepare to head to the
historic Paradise Theater and
every bank everywhere is on high
alert -- Whatever these self-styled
maverick magicians have planned
this time it will certainly have to
be done without the benefit of the
element of surprise

Oh Mr Kaplan I was wondering if

phone call since I-

MR KAPLAN
Slow times You can go home now I
won’t be needing you anymore

YOUNG TEMP
Should I come in tomorrow Because
I should tell the agency my

MR KAPLAN
That won’t be necessary I’1ll make
sure to tell the temp agency you

The temp rises gathering her things then

If you don’t mind my asking what
is it you do around here anyway

MR KAPLAN
Oh you know A little of this a

Good night

INT OFFICE - KAPLAN INC - MOMENTS LATER

Mr Kaplan steps into the spacious but almost bare office
There is a single desk in the middle of the room with a

Mr Kaplan speaks into the phone with a completely different
accent

MR KAPLAN
Hi Julie this is Stewart from
Four Horsemen management I just
wanted to check if Mr Tressler
will be at the show tonight and
see if there’s anything further we
can do for him

ASSISTANT (ON PHONE)
Mr Tressler’s already in Atlantic

He hangs up the phone Then he opens up a drawer where we
see a number of KEYS ACCESS CARDS AND MINI-HARD DRIVES

Mr Kaplan turns the corner and stops in front of the SERVICE

Mr Kaplan comes out of the service elevator and into the

corridor He stops in front of a back door swipes the

INT OFFICE SPACE -— CONTINUOUS

-- a hallway in a modern corporate space He walks casually
down the hall then stops at the corner cautiously peering
around it to see

THE OFFICE ASSISTANT he was just speaking to at her desk in
front of the STONEBRIDGE LIFE logo -- The two offices are in

the same building

Mr Kaplan looks to the side where he see a FIRE ALARM on
the wall beside him he contemplates it for a second then
shakes his head at the vulgarity of the idea He turns back
toward the assistant’s desk -- sees there is a MAN working
late in another office So Mr Kaplan clears his throat
gauges the angle and speaks at a volume (“throwing his
voice”) that makes it seem like his voice is coming from the
MAN’S OFFICE

MR KAPLAN
Hey Julie- can you come here for a
minute

The assistant gets up and walks to the far office and like a
wisp of smoke Mr Kaplan glides by behind her and walks to
the door of Tressler’s office -- It’s locked He quickly
takes out a SKELETON KEY slides it into the lock opens the
door and slips into the office quickly closing the door
behind himself with hardly a sound

A SPECTACULAR LIGHTSHOW splits the darkness -- ACCOMPANIED by
the sounds of HEAVY METAL ROCK AND ROLL and the FOUR
HORSEMEN appear onstage looking out at the cheering crowd

ANGLE ON THADDEUS

Wincing at the music disgusted he wads up some toilet paper
and sticks it into his ears as MICHAEL ATLAS steps to the
foot of the stage

MICHAEL ATLAS

Audiences for magic can be a tricky
bunch Some are happy to suspend
their disbelief Others are
constantly looking for the rabbit
under the hat the trap door the
trick wire You know who you
are

(laughter from the crowd)
As you all know tonight is the
second of our three shows and
we’re lucky to have some special
guests with us There in back
sticking toilet paper in his ears
is none other than Thaddeus
Bradley He’ll be happy to tell
you how he thinks we pulled off
tonight’s show if you can find
his DVD’s buried in the back of the
discount rack at your local video
store

SOME BOOS mixed with a few CHEERS Thaddeus gives a wave to
the crowd

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

We also have a contingent from the
police and FBI with us A pair of
them right there in the front row
and a handsome couple they are
too Wave to the nice officers

They will seek but they shall not
find For tonight we inhabit the
theater of mystery where we are
all once again wide-eyed children
awed by magic and wonder Tonight --

AND WE GO INTO A MONTAGE OF THE FANTASTIC SHOW

RODERIGO “flies” above the audience sailing over their
delighted upturned faces

LONDON looks on as an obese man walks across the stage on his
hands like a gymnast

A MERCIFULLY SHORT CLIP OF ALEX HERO singing the single most
annoying song in the history of show business

MICHAEL ATLAS moves in front of a display of mirrors with an
audience member their reflections behaving differently than
their real-life counterparts onstage and

DYLAN AND ALMA

Look at each other there is a brief moment of tenderness
between them Almost like a date Alma’s face tightens as
she remembers something and she whispers

ALMA VARGAS
Hey What I said to you before
about your daughter I was out of
line I’m

DYLAN
You were right But thanks

Then the final illusion ends with a flash and the theater is
PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS -- OVER BLACK WE HEAR

MICHAEL ATLAS (V0O)
Ladies and gentlemen we’re glad to
have been able to take your mind
off your troubles with an hour’s
divertissement

THE LIGHTS COME BACK UP illuminating MICHAEL in his T-shirt
and jeans standing at the foot of the now bare stage

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
But I can’t leave this stage in
good conscience without
acknowledging that we are living in
troubled times

THE AUDIENCE ROARS IN ANTICIPATION at the sound of these
words -- This is the moment they have been waiting for

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
At this point I’d like to introduce
our generous sponsor Mr Arthur
Tressler president of Stonebridge
Life The tickets tonight were
free but someone had to foot the
bill Where are you Arthur

ARTHUR TRESSLER sixties slick white hair kisses his TROPHY
GIRLFRIEND and stands waving to the crowd

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

Don’t sit down just yet Arthur
We’re going to put you to work

(to the crowd)
Our final number is called “The
Case of the Vanishing Money”-
Prosaic I admit but accurate
How many of you out there have your
ATM cards with you

(hands go up)
How many of you know your account
balances

(many hands stay up)
Arthur would you be so good as to
pick a volunteer from our audience

Everyone’s waving their bank cards -- Arthur Tressler spots
and points at a middle aged AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Bring her on up Arthur

Tressler somewhat reluctantly moves into the aisle and
escorts the woman up to the stage

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
I can see Arthur has an eye for
good looking ladies -- what’s your
name ma’am

AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN
Gloria

MICHAEL ATLAS
Lovely name for a lovely lady
(to Tressler)
And would you mind staying up here
on stage with us for a bit Arthur
(to the crowd)
A big hand for Mr Tressler

Tressler stays put starting to chafe Michael turns back to
Gloria

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
How about that bank card

Gloria takes it out of her bag and moves to hand it to
Michael but

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
No you hold on to that Gloria
You know how much you have in your
account

GLORIA
Unfortunately I do It’s only-

MICHAEL ATLAS
-Hold on to that thought Gloria
In the meantime we’re going to
bring out our own specially
designed ATM machine -- Roderigo

RODERIGO SANTAYANA wheels out an old fashioned BLACKBOARD
into the middle of the stage to the laughter of the
audience

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
That’s it

RODERIGO
I’m on a budget hombre

Michael turns to the other side of the stage

MICHAEL ATLAS
Alright I’m gonna need a little
extra help with this one London

LONDON OSBORNE strolls over to the blackboard as Michael
turns back to the audience

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Remember I did not pick Gloria
Our assistant for the evening Mr
Arthur Tressler did If you think
he’s in on this stick around

(then)

Gloria I want you to think of your
password

LONDON takes out a piece of chalk scribbles on the reverse-
side of the blackboard

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Okay you got it
(Gloria nods)
London

London flips the blackboard over- he’s written “SNUFFLES” on
it with the chalk Gloria’s eyes widen

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Sounds like a cutie And your
account balance is

LONDON SCRIBBLES on the other side flips the board over and
it shows 1946

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
(winces )
Okay That’s a modest sum Don’t
you think so Arthur

ARTHUR TRESSLER
I guess it is

MICHAEL ATLAS
Actually it’s a crime that’s what
it is
(to Tressler)
Would you like to hold up your ATM
card for us Arthur

ARTHUR TRESSLER
No I don’t suppose I would

THE CROWD ERUPTS IN BOOS Tressler grits his teeth reaches
into his pocket and takes out his ATM card keeping it
tightly gripped in his hand

MICHAEL ATLAS
London what is Mr Tressler’s
password

London scribbles on the back of the blackboard- flips it over
to reveal the word ASSHOLE

THE CROWD ERUPTS IN LAUGHTER -- Michael quiets them down
turns to London again

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
And his current bank balance

London scribbles on the board flips it over and we see-
258800045 The crowd gasps Michael smiles at Tressler

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

Look about right Minus the tip
you gave the limo driver on the way
over Actually I hear you’re a
pretty lousy tipper

(Tressler is now glaring

at Michael in open fury)
Ladies and gentlemen our sponsor
knows a little bit about magic as
well You see Arthur Tressler
likes to buy insurance companies at
discounted prices and then make
their assets disappear Well they
don’t reaily disappear he takes
those assets which are to be kept
safe for payouts to his customers
and deposits them into his own
accounts And they call us crooks

London erases 800000 from Tressler’s account on the board
then flips the board around and shows that GLORIA’S ACCOUNT
is now showing 80001950 The crowd laughs but

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
I know it’s just numbers on a
blackboard Mr Tressler would
you care to check your bank
balance

Tressler takes out his CELL-PHONE presses a few numbers on
the screen and suddenly

SCREENS ALL AROUND THE STAGE COME TO LIFE replicating the
IMAGE OF TRESSLER’S CELL-PHONE SCREEN His account shows
258000045 -- Eight hundred thousand dollars are missing

ARTHUR TRESSLER
This better be a joke Atlas

MICHAEL ATLAS

Or what You’ll call the cops
They’re already here remember
I’m sure they’1ll have plenty of
questions for you on the way out
But before that

(to the audience)
Everyone’s heard about all the
money raining down at our last
show- Due to circumstances beyond
our control that won’t be
happening tonight

THE CROWD BOOS LOUDLY Michael raises his hands

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
But cash is so old school don’t
you think Never let it be said
the Four Horsemen don’t move with
the times

(smiles)

How many of you have these new-
fangled phones with high speed
internet and whatnot

A scattering of HANDS GO UP

Allow me to bring the rest of you
into the 21st Century Would you
all check you pockets your hand-
bags

ANGLES ON THE AUDIENCE all finding NEW PHONES nestled in
their pockets and personal belongings

turn those on you’ll find all your
information has been transferred to

As the phones are turned on the darkness illuminated by the
blue screens like the sky being filled with a thousand stars

Tonight’s audience was supposed to
be chosen by a random drawing But
I have to admit we cheated
Everyone here has one thing in
common -- Youre all customers of
companies Arthur Tressier has
purchased You believed yourselves
to be in good hands- but if you
need a large payout there will be
nothing in the bank

ANGLES ON THE AUDIENCE Distraught faces lit blue by the
phones

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
He’s been hustling you like a
street-corner shell-game artist
When audited he moves the money
from one account to another He
has robbed each and every one of
you

But fear not Tonight this theater
is a true house of magic

AGENT FULLER (VO)
-- Some dummy company Kaplan Inc
leased out office space in the
Stonebridge Life building months
before last night’s show They had
access to the building blueprints
the entire space They stole
access cards keys you name it
and from internal phone records and
security files gained access to
Stonebridge’s entire database as
well

IMAGES OF AGENTS questioning a NUMBER OF YOUNG TEMPS the one
we saw in the scene with “George Kaplan” among them

-- and the rest is history

HERNANDEZ

The money for the office rent came
out of Stonebridge Life’s own
coffers These guys are real good
and they’re making us look real
bad

(hard)
Three days to their last show We
get caught with our pants down
again heads are gonna roll

Thaddeus Bradley is chuckling the others turn to

AGENT FULLER
What’s so goddamn funny

THADDEUS
“George Kaplan”

HERNANDEZ
What about him

THADDEUS
I made Michael Atlas in disguise
slipping into the theater at the
last minute before the show
Clearly he got past your eagle-
eyes without much of an effort

DYLAN
Atlas was with the others from the
moment they left the hotel
Inspector Vargas saw him with her
own eyes

him

THADDEUS

She saw someone disguised as
Michael Atlas while Atlas himself
was in New York City disguised as
“George Kaplan”

(smiles)
He always did have an unhealthy
fascination with Cary Grant

DYLAN
Alright Maybe there is a Fifth
Horseman Probably the same one
who was in disguise as the others
in Vegas while they were in Paris
pulling off the bank job but-

AGENT FULLER
Five Horsemen six Horsemen How
do we know there aren’t ten of
them How do we know they’re not a
front for a whole bunch of guys-

THADDEUS
Unlikely I wouldn’t waste
precious time contemplating it

DYLAN
What would you do Bradley I’m
sick of you telling us what we
don’t know without giving us
anything we can actually use -- For
all we know you’re the Fifth
Horseman

THADDEUS
Which is why you had me followed
all day in Atlantic City Were you
my shadow Agent Hobbes Whoever
it was I must admit he was rather
good I couldn’t make head or tail
of him

Dylan‘s face is tight He says nothing biting down his
embarrassment as Thaddeus continues

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
In any case it’s your job to make
the case stick I’m here to tell
you what I know which at present
is a hell of a lot more than you
do

(turns to Agent Fuller)
(MORE)
THADDEUS (CONT’D)
-And to spare you the price of a
discount DVD the new phones were
simply slipped into the audience’s
bags and pockets when they passed
through “security” an illusionist
might employ a dozen such sleight
of hand artists and cutpurses at
any given show

AGENT FULLER
I might be a rube but even I kinda
figured that In fact this whole
Tressler thing wasn’t all that much
of a trick you ask me

THADDEUS
It wasn’t meant to be It’s called
the “Mezzo”-a kind of entre-acte
Not particularly impressive on its
own but designed to get the
audience on your side- which they
certainly have succeeded in doing-
while laying the groundwork for a
final denouement

AGENT FULLER
What I don’t get is why they’re
doing all this and not keeping any
of the money

THADDEUS

The Four Horsemen’s methods might
be mysterious but their motives
are not They’re not after wealth
They’re after fame immortality
To be mentioned in the same breath
as Robert-Houdin Hermann Houdini

(pauses)
But who would risk life in prison
only to remain anonymous in
success This fifth Horseman- and
there is a fifth without a doubt-
his motives are as mysterious as
his methods

DYLAN

You know what I don’t buy Your
motives You told us you want to
be relevant- but what you are is
hated You break the code of your
own kind every day and for what
A few bucks fifteen minutes of
fame Don’t you have any sense of
honor

THADDEUS
Is there something you love Agent
Hobbes That you would protect
even at the expense of your own
happiness or reputation

Dylan gives no answer Thaddeus continues

THADDEUS (CONT’D)

There is a legend- nothing we magic
types love more than a good legend-
of a secret sect of magicians that
existed at the beginnings of our
order’s inception Perhaps as long
ago as ancient Mesopotamia This
sect was known as “The Eye”-

(smiles)
-Where did you think the Masons got
it from “The Eye” was a cult
within a cult a secret society
whose task it was to uphold the
honor of the craft- something like
your own Internal Affairs
Department yes And when a rogue
magician overstepped his bounds or
misused his craft it was the task
of The Eye to bring him down in a
manner that would restore the honor
of the order

Thaddeus’s voice is low but his emotions are boiling

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
Most of my “kind” as you put it
have devolved into a shameful lot
of showboating Hollywood wannabes
and Las Vegas whores They have
turned magic into vulgar
pornography Unfortunately there
is no secret order to protect my
beloved art so I have taken that
onerous task upon my own shoulders

DYLAN
For a six figure television deal

THADDEUS
Fire with fire Agent Hobbes

Alma has entered the doorway a sheaf of papers in her hands
ALMA VARGAS

How about we protect our reputation
as law enforcement officers before
these guys make us look like a

stare-down I found something you
should see

paper scattered all around her as the others look on

ALMA VARGAS

every account Tressler had stashed
his ill gotten gains in amazing
the access you guys have by the
way

DYLAN
Yeah thanks to Osama We got in
there after 9-11 and never left

AGENT FULLER
Why we vote Republican

ALMA VARGAS
Right In any case among many
other banks around the world
Arthur Tressler has a fairly
significant account with Credit
Lyonnais

DYLAN
Among many other banks

ALMA VARGAS
But he only has a secure safety
deposit box in one

Arthur Tressler has a safety
deposit box in Paris In the bank
branch the Four Horsemen robbed

authority to have it searched

MICHAEL ATLAS
Hey see that guy over there at
the bar Can you give this to him

THE KID nods hurries to a MAN sitting at the bar sipping a
Martini and hands him the napkin the man unfolds it sees
there’s a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL in there and written on the

INT HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michael steps inside then stops in the foyer as he sees

LONDON OSBORNE RODERIGO and ALEX HERO all are there waiting
for him

MICHAEL ATLAS
Let yourself in why don’t you

I detect an Ides of March vibe in
here Are you hiding daggers under
your sleeves

LONDON
Who is he

Michael knew this was coming he sighs shaking his head

MICHAEL ATLAS
We’ve been through this I don’t
know

RODERIGO
When I was a young apprentice
touring with Reynaldino he found
out his daughter was slipping into
my room One morning in Las Carnes
I went to the outhouse to do what
you do in an outhouse When I
opened the door I found myself in
Carboneras two hundred kilometers
away Took me three years to
figure out how he did that I
swore from that day on I would be
the one pulling the strings I
don’t like this

MICHAEL ATLAS

Don’t like what Being the talk of
the entire world Famous beyond
your wildest dreams

(real emotion seeping in)
You know what I remember about my
youth TV dinners Reruns
Volume turned up to drown out my
parents’ squabble du jour Trying
to make myself be small to
disappear To be nothing That’s
what I swore I’d never go back to

(pauses)
No one will ever forget what we’re
doing as long as magic is talked
about

The others watch Michael simmer down They’ve never seen him
like this then
MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
The Horsemen was his idea He
brought me in and I came to you
He’s done everything he said he
would to aT And his only
stipulation was anonymity

LONDON
That’s a big bloody stipulation

MICHAEL ATLAS
He was right there with you in
Atlantic City wearing my face If
you’re so concerned you should
have asked him yourself

LONDON
I did He told me to sod off

ALEX
London tried to put the stare on
him too guy laughed in his

face Some funny shit homes

LONDON
Whoever this bloke is he’s good
And plugged in as hell Everything
he told us to say to provoke those
Feds was spot on Got them hot to
trot like greyhounds on a hare

MICHAEL ATLAS
So what’s the problem

ALEX
It’s all been good so far but
we’re about to get into the big
money How do we know he’s not
setting us up to eat it this time

MICHAEL ATLAS
We don’t

LONDON
Makes it bloody dangerous mate

MICHAEL ATLAS
Bloody dangerous And bloody fun

(then)
Are the Four Horsemen going out on
a cute credit scam trick -- or are

we going out on top of the world

The others consider Michael’s words then

Dylan Alma Vargas Agent Fuller Thaddeus Bradley and a
handful of FBI AGENTS are studying the images on the screens

AGENT FULLER
And what the hell was in there

Alma reads from a printed out list

ALMA VARGAS
A couple of diamond rings- the kind
you give a girl you want to
convince of your intentions Ora
couple of girls A watch with his
father’s inscription on it A
letter from an ex-wife And that
as they say is all she wrote

THADDEUS
They did not break into that box
only to leave everything in it
intact There has to be something
you’re missing

DYLAN
You’re right about that In fact
I had them go over the base of the
box with one of those “scientific
instruments we’re so proud of”- an
infra-blue scanner

IMAGES OF THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX appear on the MONITOR there
is an IMPRINT VISIBLE -- LINES THAT LOOK LIKE A CORNER FROM

AN ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT AS WELL AS SEVERAL NUMBERS CUT

OFF IN THE MIDDLE

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Residue from blueprints of some
kind Printed on good old
fashioned carbon paper
(to Thaddeus )
See around here we do real magic

ALMA VARGAS

A YOUNG AGENT turns from the screen he is studying

Their next show is in LA- tomorrow
night But that doesn’t mean much
They pulled off their robberies a
good distance away from their shows

good deal closer than the first
Their preparation time for this one
will be even less and wherever
they’re planning to

YOUNG AGENT

YOUNG AGENT

of a humdrum neighborhood
AGENT FULLER

How much money does a place like

The Young Agent types again and

Paris We also found your security
deposit box there and what was in

it

ARTHUR TRESSLER

You went into my private box There

are laws that-

DYLAN

We didn’t go into it The French
did under the blanket of financial
terrorism laws too complicated for

me to-

ARTHUR TRESSLER

-So what So you found my father’s

ALMA VARGAS
-And two rings

ARTHUR TRESSLER
There’s more than one pretty girl

what that is

DYLAN

to employees who work at that
facility cleverly funneled so as
not to compromise their identities

(then)
Were you siphoning freshly printed
money from the US government Mr
Tressler

ARTHUR TRESSLER
I was not I am being set up by
those four goddamn magicians you
morons

ALMA VARGAS
Maybe maybe not If you’ll excuse
me for saying so you’re a hard man
to trust Mr Tressler

DYLAN
There is however one thing we do
know with certainty -- The only way

to breach a facility like that is
with someone on the inside We
want the names of the employees you
sent money to and we want them
now

ARTHUR TRESSLER
I told you I have no idea what
you’re talking about The Horsemen
were able to access my account --

want to with my money

INT BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

London walks into the raucous space he’s wearing glasses a

recognizable He pushes his way to the bar jostling a BIG
BRUISER and leans toward the BARTENDER who’s shoulder we are
over

LONDON
I’‘1l have a Guinness
BARTENDER
Don’t have Guinness
LONDON
Then how about a bloody mojito Not
too leafy

The Bartender steps out of frame and London takes in his
surroundings until the Bartender slams some kind of DRINK
down in front of him

BARTENDER
Mojitos are eight bucks Ten for
you

LONDON

Make it twenty for all I care
This bloke here with the rancid
breath is paying for it innat

THE BIG BRUISER can hardly believe his ears

BIG BRUISER

No you’re not You’re weak Youre
weak as a baby You’re so bloody

slowly sinks down to his knees

DYLAN
Hadn’t heard about that but thanks
for the tip

LT THOMAS
Let me give you a little history
lesson The BEP has been around
since 1861 and in that time in
all our facilities do you know how
many successful robberies there’ve
been Zero Not one

OFFICER SIEGEL
We’re not some we’re not some
ragtag rent-a-cops We are the BEP
police force No one’s getting in
here

LT THOMAS
There have been attempts before
sure But they’ve always been
inside jobs and they’ve always
been caught

DYLAN
I didn’t say it wasn’t going to be
an inside job -- in part

(then)
We have indications that they have

had somehow gained possession of

Sure I want to We just don’t
know

Yeah Be sure to let us know when
you find out

They stop in front of a CAGED IN HOLDING AREA where the

ALMA VARGAS
You just opened three doors in a

you have a master pass that allows
you access to the entire building

What are you saying

ALMA VARGAS
Just that if someone wanted to rob
this place it would help if they
knew you

LT THOMAS

Except for one thing detective
Everyone would know it was me

I spend enough time behind bars
during the day I don’t have any
desire to spend my nights the same

Everyone here’s given the strictest
background check You’re free to

Today as you know we suffered
another loss Alex Hero is gone
But we’re going to honor him the
best way we know how the way he
would have wanted us to-

Michael points his finger and FIREWORKS GO OFF -- HEAVY METAL
STARTS POUNDING The crowd rises to their feet CHEERING
and

INT ROOFTOP - OUTSIDE MONEY FACTORY

FBI SNIPERS peer through the scopes of high-powered rifles
Their angle is bad but they can get a glimpse of the ARMORED
TRUCK by the loading dock as

EXT REAR OF MONEY FACTORY - CONTINUOUS
Dylan and Agent Fuller watch silently waiting then

TWO UNIFORMED MEN step outside of the armored truck One of
them walks to the rear gate takes out a SWIPE CARD and runs
it past the electronic lock causing the gate to start
opening

THEN A THIRD UNIFORMED MAN opens the doors from inside the
back of the truck revealing a CACHE OF HEAVY WEAPONS

DYLAN
Oh hell Not good Not good at
all
(to Thaddeus)
You stay put Do not leave the
car

He quietly opens the car door and steps outside followed by
Fuller both of them drawing their weapons

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Easy easy does it

Then they see that a SECURITY GUARD from inside the Money
Factory is approaching the opening gate the THIRD UNIFORMED
MAN is picking up a SHOTGUN from the back of the truck and
suddenly-

BOOM Dylan winces as Agent Fuller’s gun goes off right next
to his ear

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Jeezus

Agent Fuller looks shocked shaking his head in dismay- as
the THREE UNIFORMED MEN turn in surprise looking extremely
confused and

AGENT FULLER
I didn’t mean it man I swear to
christ I-

But Dylan is already running forward gun leveled shouting

DYLAN
Get your hands in the air Get them

upin the air

THE UNIFORMED MEN look around still in confusion and

DYLAN (CONT’D)

(into his ear-piece)
Give them warning shots Nothing
fatal

A COUPLE OF SNIPER BULLETS hit the ground near the uniformed
men who drop their weapons and throw their hands up -- Then
Dylan is on them kicking their legs out from under them
shouting

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Spread eagle Arms wide Do it

They do it Dylan kneels down and pulls their caps off-
looks at their faces- JUST THREE TOUGH LOOKING GUYS WEVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE

Agent Fuller rushes over breathing hard

AGENT FULLER
Who the hell are they

DYLAN
I have no goddamn idea

INT STAGE - SPORTS ARENA

London Osborne stands in front of a row of VOLUNTEERS like a
conductor watching them each expertly juggle a HALF-DOZEN
EGGS in the air as if they were expert jugglers

London turns and gives the audience a cheeky look SNAPS HIS
FINGERS and suddenly the volunteers are fumbling and
surprised the EGGS LANDING EVERYWHERE splattering on their
heads on the floor as the audience is convulsed with
LAUGHTER

EXT REAR OF MONEY FACTORY - NIGHT

THE THREE UNIFORMED MEN ARE sitting on the ground beside the
gathered forces of the FBI and BEP hands cuffed behind their
backs -- A YOUNG AGENT looks up from his lap-top

YOUNG AGENT
These characters aren’t on any of
the security clearance databases
(MORE)

YOUNG AGENT (CONTD)
They aren’t registered armored
guards either Not from any known
company

HERNANDEZ
(to the uniformed men)
You want to tell me who you are

UNIFORMED MAN 1
We have a nine o’clock pickup We
have to pick up our payload at
nine

Dylan steps over holding their SWIPE CARDS

DYLAN
They had cards with access to every
room in the facility

The Agents all look up at Lt Thomas and Officer Siegel

LT THOMAS
I’m the only one with that kind of
access But I sure as shit didn’t
give it to these jokers
(to the unformed men)
Where did you get these cards

UNINORMED MAN 2
We were following procedure We
didn’t do anything wrong

THEN A CELL PHONE BUZZES from the back pocket of UNIFORMED
GUY 1

DYLAN removes it looks at the screen a TEXT MESSAGE THAT
READS MY COUSIN HAS A SWEATER LIKE THAT IS IT WOOL

DYLAN
“My cousin has a sweater like that
Is it wool”
(then)
What the hell is that supposed to-

THADDEUS
It’s code

Everyone turns and looks at Thaddeus who strides over

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
Old magician’s code Houdini’s
favorite for its utter banality
(MORE)

THADDEUS (CONT’D)

During his act he would ask it of
an accomplice in order to let him
know if he was set to go on with a
trick

(then)
“Cotton” was the response given
when the answer was “yes”

UNINORMED MAN 2
This is bullshit We had a nine
o’clock pickup We were here on
time We were following procedure

DYLAN
We’re not gonna get anything from
these guys like this Give me two
hours with them back at HQ and
I’l1l-

HERNANDEZ
You will do nothing Agent Hobbes

Dylan falls silent SAC HERNANDEZ waves to his men

HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)

Clear the area Lt Thomas this
is your collar You are coming
with me to interrogate these men
I have one or two little questions
for you to answer as well

(turns to ALMA)
Detective Vargas your work on this
case has been exemplary- but after
you file your report with the BEP
you better catch the first flight
back to Vegas

Alma bites her lip Keeps her feelings down Hernandez
glares at Dylan

HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
You are done for tonight Hobbes
You and Agent Fuller the both of
you Done

Dylan takes that in Nods Types into the cell phone he’s
holding C-0-T-T-O-N- then puts the phone into Hernandez’s
hand and

INT STAGE - SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

THE CROWD CHEERS as RODERIGO stands underneath TWO BEAUTIFUL
GIRLS spinning them overhead with his fingers

only the girls are split into TWO as they spin their legs

and torsos interchanging in the air above the magicians’
head

EXT REAR OF MONEY FACTORY - NIGHT
Dylan and Alma stand by Agent Fuller who is still shaken

AGENT FULLER
Sorry I let you down I don’t
know I saw the weapons and I
overreacted I screwed up

ALMA VARGAS
We all screwed up Nothing to do
about it now

DYLAN

Yeah there is
(pauses)

We might not be able to arrest him
but as far Michael Atlas knows
things went off just the way he
planned We’re fifteen minutes
from Downtown I don’t know about
you

Reaches into his jacket comes out holding the TICKETS
MICHAEL GAVE HIM

DYLAN (CONT’D)
But I’m gonna be there to see his
face when he realizes he’s wrong

INT SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT
CLOSE ON MICHAEL -- FACE ILLUMINATED BY A HARSH SPOTLIGHT

MICHAEL ATLAS
Ladies and gentlemen we’re glad to
have been able to take your mind
off your troubles with a few hours’
divertissement

WIDE ANGLE ON THE HUGE ARENA

THE AUDIENCE rises to its collective feet giving a standing
ovation in anticipation of the Horsemen’s newest finale

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
-- But I can’t leave this stage
without acknowledging that we are
living in hard times

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON DYLAN ALMA VARGAS AGENT FULLER AND
THADDEUS BRADLEY making their way toward the front of arena
and

ANGLE ON MICHAEL spotting them a smile spreads across his
face

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
We know you’re all suffering But
this is the biggest audience we’ve
had there’s a lot of you out
there That means we have to come
up with our biggest score yet And
money doesn’t grow on trees

(pauses)

But it is printed in factories

Michael turns to RODERIGO who pulls a lever and a DOZEN
HUGE SCREENS descend around Michael seeming to hover in the
air -- RODERIGO takes out a HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA points it
at the screens and

THE SCREENS SUDDENLY FILL with an IMAGE OF THE MONEY FACTORY
moving through it as if filmed by RODERIGO’S CAMERA as he
paces the stage

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Some of these places- like this
one- can hold nearly a billion
dollars at any given time Can you
believe that

ANGLE ON DYLAN AND ALMA -- Looking at each other how do
these quys do this

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
And here it is the room where all
that money is held And there it
is in that glass covered pallet
Newly printed Almost One Billion
Dollars

THE AUDIENCE falls into a hush hardly breathing at the
image of the CAGED ROOM HOLDING THE MONEY on the SCREENS

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
The government prints it just like
that whenever they want to But I
think for once someone else
should decide where it goes don’t
you

THE CROWD ANSWERS WITH AN UPROARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Alright then So with a single
snap of the fingers-

Michael turns to the screens- SNAPS Nothing happens A
beat

Michael turns and shoots a look at Roderigo- who shakes his
head with a look that says “I don’t know what the hell is
going on”

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
This is a really hard one

SNAPS his finger again Again nothing Michael waits
another moment Then recomposing himself turns back to the
audience

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen it looks like
you’re not going to get the finale
you were expecting tonight

THE BIGGEST BOO YOU’VE EVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE

DURING THE CACOPHONY EYE-CONTACT passes between MICHAEL AND
DYLAN MICHAEL AND ALMA MICHAEL AND THADDEUS various
degrees of gloating in their eyes a tinge of defeat in his
then

MICHAEL raises his hands trying to quiet down the crowd

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Is this really why you’re here
For the money Are you becoming
the very people you disdain The
people you come to see us
humiliate Aren’t there more
important things in life- like
Love

IF YOU THOUGHT THE FIRST ROUND OF BOOING WAS BAD -- MICHAEL
HAS TO SHOUT TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE CROWD

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
-- Like happiness Like friends
Didn’t Jesus himself say it was
easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to get into heaven

AS MICHAEL SPEAKS THE LIGHTS subtly change from WHITE TO
YELLOW TO ORANGE TO RED A STRANGE ROARING SOUND is
beginning to fill the AUDITORIUM

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)

-- The same Jesus who when a good
man called Lazarus died reached
forth and brought him back to life
They said Jesus was the son of God
when he did it If I can do the
same thing what does that make
me

Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION from behind Michael
and

A FLAMING AUTOMOBILE comes flying through the air sailing
over his head and crash lands right at the foot of the
stage and

A BURNING MAN comes flailing out of the car covered in
flames like the human torch and

RODERIGO AND LONDON OSBORNE run in from the sides with FIRE
EXTINGUISHERS and douse the flames revealing the man to be

ALEX HERO -- Looking as if he has just been through the
wringer He stands shakily at the foot of the stage for an
instant then raises his hands above his head and

THE AUDIENCE GASPS THEN RISES TO THEIR FEET laughing and
applauding

ANGLES ON DYLAN -- ALMA -- THADDEUS -- AGENT FULLER -- They
can’t believe their eyes as

LONDON
Boyo you gave us all the scare of
our bloody lives Where the hell
have you been

ALEX
Not Hell yo I was worried
Michael might lose his magic
tonight so I went to the other
side to bring him back this

He holds up a simple MAGIC WAND
MICHAEL ATLAS

My wand The one I had as a boy
But-—

ALEX
It’s alright homes Your Moms
wanted you to have it Please I
might not have gone though Hell to
get it but I passed awful close

Michael reaches out as the crowd cheers its encouragement
and takes the wand He hugs Alex and the crowd explodes
then Michael turns back to the audience

MICHAEL ATLAS
You know the real magic this wand
had was the ability to make people
smile And this being our last
show you know we want to leave you
smiling so

Michael suddenly turns to the SCREENS behind him on which
the IMAGE OF THE CAGE-ROOM IN THE MONEY FACTORY is still
showing and

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
Abracadabra

And- WHOOMP- The IMAGE CHANGES to that of the same room but
with the PALLET OF MONEY NOW SUDDENLY GONE A gasp from the
audience

MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D)
If you still don’t know us very
well and think this is just a
trick- do yourself a favor and pick
up the papers tomorrow morning

DYLAN’S PHONE is vibrating he raises it to his ear
struggling to hear above the din as SAC HERNANDEZ’S VOICE
COMES IN

HERNANDEZ (ON PHONE)
Hobbes are you there The goddamn
Money Factory has just been robbed
Can you hear me

DYLAN
What How By who How the-

MICHAEL ATLAS (0S)
As for the rest of you- want to see
where all that money went

THE ROAR drowns out any chance of Dylan being able to hear
anything else on the phone he grimaces looking back at the
stage as

MICHAEL reaches down near the bottom of the closest SCREEN
and comes up with a single TWENTY DOLLAR BILL He throws it
upward and

THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL shoots up high into the air of the
cavernous stadium which suddenly seems to EXPLODE WITH
MONEY CASH FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE FROM EVERY DIRECTION
and

THE CROWD GOES MAD -- PEOPLE JUMP IN THE AIR REACHING FOR
THE BILLS DIVING TO THE FLOOR SCOOPING IT UP BY THE
HANDFUL

EXT OUTSIDE THE SPORTS ARENA - CONTINUOUS

MONEY IS BLOWING OUT OF VENTS from the exterior of the arena

DYLAN ALMA AGENT FULLER and THADDEUS catch a last look at

THE FOUR HORSEMEN

Who hold hands at the foot of the stage raising them in the
air in a salute before backing away and vanishing under the

THADDEUS nods slightly as if impressed despite himself Then
he turns walks away heading back up the aisle disappearing
into the maelstrom

EXT FBI HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

AN UNMARKED CAR screeches to a stop in the parking lot
Dylan Alma and Agent Fuller get out and head toward the
front doors we hear on the SOUNDTRACK

DYLAN (V0)

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

SAC HERNANDEZ backed by a room bustling with activity faces
our agents Lt Thomas Officer Siegel and a GUARD CAPTAIN
FROM THE MONEY FACTORY are beside him

OFFICER SIEGEL
As soon as you cleared out I
headed back to the control center
I’m not sure what happened next

GUARD CAPTAIN
What happened next was some of the
guys saw Lt Thomas making his way
toward the cage

Dylan Alma and Agent Fuller turn toward Lt Thomas who
snarls

LT THOMAS
I have been with SAC Hernandez the
entire time

A PHOTOGRAPH of the now EMPTY CAGE-ROOM before turning and
wheeling the PALLET down the corridor

GUARD CAPTAIN (VO)
-- He was moving the money toward
the loading dock when we finally
got our shit together and moved in
on him but

A TERRIBLE SONIC WHINE CUTS THROUGH THE AIR -- And the ARMED
GUARDS drop their weapons clutching their ears and sinking
to their knees in pain

TIGHT SHOTS -- SEVERAL HIGH-TECH ULTRASOUND TRANSMITTERS have
been magnetically attached to the grated walls in strategic
places along the corridor red lights indicating activity

CLOSE ON “LT THOMAS’S” EAR -- BLOCKED BY A SPECIAL PLUG
emitting a counter-frequency as he hustles the PALLET toward
the loading dock and

BACK TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM
Where the Guard Captain is shaking his head

GUARD CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
My ears are still ringing like
erazy Only reason I can hear you
at all is I was up on the second
level when it happened

ALMA VARGAS
So now these guys have access to
high-tech military equipment

AGENT FULLER
Ain’t that hard if you know the
right people and grease the right
palms

IMAGE OF THE LOADING AREA BEHIND THE MONEY FACTORY “Lt
THOMAS” rolls the PALLET OF MONEY into the back of the
ARMORED TRUCK that is still there slams the doors shut runs
into the driver’s seat and starts it up

A FEW GUARDS come out blasting at the armored truck but the
bullets bounce off and the truck pulls out into the street

OFFICER SIEGEL (V0O)
Every police car in the area was
put on instant notice had at
least a dozen heading toward the
scene

IMAGES OF POLICE CARS RACING THROUGH THE STREETS SIRENS
BLARING and

HERNANDEZ (VO)
We were notified as well turned
right around But it didn’t make a
damn bit of difference

THE ARMORED TRUCK turns a corner onto a deserted street then
drives into an UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT filled with among
other vehicles a row of BODEGA-STYLE FOOD TRUCKS

IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT “Lt THOMAS” pulls a lever under the
dashboard activating

THE OUTSIDE PANELS OF THE TRUCK to COLLAPSE INWARD AND FLIP

OVER -- A remarkable feat of mechanical trickery that within
seconds has what was once an “armored truck” looking almost
exactly like a BODEGA-STYLE FOOD TRUCK

OUTSIDE THE PARKING LOT “Lt THOMAS” steps out into the
street pulling off his toupee He sends the image of the

EMPTY CAGE ROOM on his cell phone as he walks past and we
pan around to see

the show taking place within on the MONITORS placed outside
the arena

roll behind the freeway median and into a prepared HIDING
SPOT pulling a rusted grating over himself

A YOUNG AGENT addresses the group

YOUNG AGENT
John Doe Probably taken from a

DYLAN

FOCUS TO THE ROUGH CROWD and see that the OTHER TWO MEN are

BACK TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM
SAC HERNANDEZ steps up to the monitors

HERNANDEZ

some pineapple for their breakfast

ALMA VARGAS

BEEP Hung up Alma looks around at the others a sinking
feeling overtaking her and

ALMA VARGAS (CONT’D)
You want some pineapple

THE UNIFORMED MENS’ HEADS DROP like puppets with their
strings cut two of them slump back against the wall the

He slowly rises looking completely baffled confused
then frightened

Where the hell am I

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - FBI HEADQUARTERS - LATER

THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS are sitting around looking
completely defeated

DYLAN
What about the money

Holds up SEVERAL BILLS he collected during the show’s finale

DYLAN (CONT’D)

We can still tie them in to the
stolen money There’s just so much
explaining they can do as to how
they got hold of it this time
That’s something that’1ll stick in
court

LT THOMAS
My people have already run the
serial numbers on as many of the
bills as we could collect None of
them match the stolen money Most
of them aren’t even all that new

DYLAN
You mean

LT THOMAS
The Four Horsemen rained millions
of dollars of their own money all
over that crowd Nothing near what
they stole but it still had to be
a lot No law against throwing
away your own money though

A beat then
DYLAN
Then the stolen money is still out
there
ANOTHER FBI AGENT turns from his computer screen

Dylan takes a moment then leans over to Thaddeus and
whispers ever so softly in his ear

DYLAN

Thaddeus looks confused for a moment then his eyes widen as
he begins to understand -- and as it comes together in his
mind we see

A FLOW OF IMAGES SHOWING DYLAN AT KEY MOMENTS

THE FIRST SHOW The “USHER” takes the DRINK from Thaddeus --
as he walks away we see that it is Dylan in disquise and

DYLAN uses an INFRA-BLUE CAMERA to photograph THADDEUS’S

imprint the prints into the fingertips of a pair of LATEX
GLOVES then to

nightmare He looks up to see that Dylan is already on the
other side of the gate and musters his voice to ask

THADDEUS
But why

Thaddeus stands walks toward the gate

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
You never kept any of the money
The Horsemen are rich famous
beyond measure but you why

DYLAN
You once asked me if there is
anything I love That I would
protect even at the expense of my
own happiness or reputation Now
you know the answer

Dylan turns to face Thaddeus
DYLAN (CONT’D)
See the thing about legends is-
sometimes they’re true
Dylan raises his fist then opens his hand revealing

A TATTOO OF AN EYE INSIDE A TRIANGLE imprinted on his palm

DYLAN (CONT’D)
Now you see me

Dylan closes his hand opens it again and the tattoo is
one

THADDEUS
The Eye But that’s insane It’s a

myth There’s no Secret Order
It’s a bedtime story

But Dylan is already walking away leaving Thaddeus behind in
his cell and

CLOSE ON THADDEUS
His face trembling with fury and disbelief

THADDEUS (CONT’D)
It’s just a goddamn story
