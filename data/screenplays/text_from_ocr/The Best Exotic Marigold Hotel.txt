fortune of serving as a junior to

Mr Justice Stancombe

Grahams not listening any more Hes looking around the
room At the old tired faces

JUDGE (CONTD)

the unwelcome news that I
would transfer Chambers bringing
to mind the old adage a fronte
praecipitium a tergo lupi
Everything seems to slow down the judges mouth moving
more and more sluggishly though his voice remains the
same The effect is strange then the sound of laughter

GRAHAM
This is the day
Everyone looks round at him Hes almost as surprised as
they are that hes spoken out loud

GILES
Graham

GRAHAM
This is the day
He turns and walks out

The road appears to be complete chaos cars buses even
cows overtaking each other

The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which
is overtaking some slower vehicles As the truck pulls back
into the inside lane it reveals a huge truck barrelling
towards them on the wrong carriageway

The tuk-tuks have pulled up and our travellers emerge

the Marigold Hotel Once a beautiful building once
possibly even luxurious it is clearly in the process of
being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs
Parts of the building are freshly painted some of the
ornate balconies are crumbling and one wall is clad with
crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding A huge old tree towers
over an untended garden its branches poking into the
windows of the building

haphazardly

Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building
towards her room

SONNY

This is a building of the utmost
character which means that
perhaps not everything will
function in the way you expect it
to But as the manager and chief
executive supervising officer of
the Marigold Hotel I can tell
you with great pride that the
building has stood for centuries
and will stand for many more in
100 shipshape condition Please

most successfully all the way to

your bedroom
The room is very small comfortable and tastefully
decorated But theres no door

MADGE
My dear man Rooms have doors
What youre showing me here is an

alcove
SONNY
The door is coming soon most

staying

stayed for years Until one
night he became something more

happy again And I was right
Because quite suddenly it was
over Wed fallen asleep and
they found us

of them I dont know what I
couldve done but it shouldve
been more than nothing I put up
no fight I let it happen

The people live on the streets or in collapsing tin
shacks Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation

horrified by her surroundings And acutely aware of the
stares of the slum-dwellers

seat re-ground

Douglas glances back at Evelyn Who betrays not the
slightest scepticism

Jamshed studies the tap

JAMSHED
The gland nut has come away from
the spindle

DOUGLAS
Well of course it could be that
too Can you fix it

JAMSHED
Not cheaply Not cheaply Most
expensively indeed
Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back
to fiddle with it Douglas joins Evelyn

DOUGLAS
I was in a tuk-tuk the other day
didnt seem to be taking the
usual route back to the hotel
It turned out that the driver had
decided to take me to another
hotel that he was sure I would
prefer And of course one wants
to believe that he genuinely had
my welfare at heart and that it
wasnt run bg his brother-in-law

(MORE )

DOUGLAS (CONTD)
One wants to trust in general
dont you think But you never
really know do you

it
EVELYN
The day I met my husband was the
day the fair came to town My
girlfriend and I went on the
carousel Her horse was fine
But when the ride began I felt
mine give a little like it might
collapse Then these strong arms
were around me holding the horse
together And a voice in my ear
said Just trust me And I did
Without question Until the day
he died

DOUGLAS
How wonderful

EVELYN
The sale of our flat went through
last week I had to sell it to
pay off Hughs debts

But even at Sonnys rates I
still couldnt make ends meet
After what my own husband did to
our life savings

Graham is startled He tries gently to pull back but she
holds on

Ajit starts to translate But Muriel doesnt wait

MURIEL (CONTD)
Thats the mistake see You

start feeling part of something
One day they decided I needed
some help I was grateful I
tried to teach her Not just the
books but how to crisp up the
bacon like the gentleman
preferred it the way the little
one liked to have her hair
brushed The things you only
know if you care But then they
said I was no longer useful to
them Thanked me for my service
As if thats all it was

(BEAT)
I got a flat in the end Im the
only one in the building not a
foreigner More Indians there
than here But before I came to
this place my biggest problem
was what to do with all the time
I had Because that flats so
small I can have the whole place
spotless in half an hour And
then what am I supposed to do for
the rest of the day
Theres silence for a bit Then Ajit speaks

AJIT
Did you want me translate that as
well
Muriel smiles Its the first time weve seen this
Muriel stops thrusts something into Ajits hand

MURIEL
Give her these

Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him a packet of
Chocolate Hobnobs

Graham takes it and walks on munching the delicious
fruit A contented man

134 EXT GARDEN MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 134

Norman is sitting on a stone bench under a spreading tree

NORMAN

Norman is a bit startled by this

NORMAN

GRAHAM

NORMAN

GRAHAM

(smiling unperturbed)

I didnt know how hed been in

him and his family and imagined
he might hate me for it

(BEAT)
But we talked all night Hes
been happy Hes led a peaceful
life married to a woman who
understood him and loved him
nonetheless But hes never
forgotten me Thats what he
said

(BEAT)
I asked his forgiveness anyway
He said he had nothing to forgive
me for That instead I should
forgive myself

(BEAT)
All that time All that time I
believed Id sentenced him to a
life of shame When I was the
one in prison

(BEAT)
But not any more

Silence for a while

NORMAN
Top of the mountain

GRAHAM
Yes
Norman smiles then stands and goes on inside
Graham settles back into his chair looks out at the world

136 EXT STAIRCASE MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 136

Norman on the stairs to his room
He stops catches his breath

137 EXT GARDEN MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 137

Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird A snow
crane white and magnificent Its on the grass in front
of him

Then it opens its huge wings takes off And flies up into
the bright blue sky Its an extraordinary sight

As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip it appears
suddenly to slow and stall until it seems to hang in the
air almost motionless

138 EXT ROOFTOP MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 138

Norman crosses the rooftop to his bedroom He comes
inside sits on the bed

139 EXT GARDEN MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 139

Graham is still sitting in the garden

EVELYN (0S)

She breaks off

139A EXT COURTYARD MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139A

Evelyn stares out of the window Madge Norman Douglas
and Jean are behind her Opposite sits Manoj Evelyn
turns to look at him and at Gaurika Manojs wife who
sits beside him

EVELYN (V0)

of us know when Graham died of

a heart attack evidently not his
first So he had a better idea
than most what was coming he
just neglected to tell us His
prerogative
142 EXT LAKE - DAWN 142

Three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway
which barely rises above the surface of the lake They
seem to be floating Clouds of dust billow behind them

EVELYN (V0)

There was talk of sending the
body home but Manoj felt he
should have a Hindu burial At
the place they had visited
together Not a holy place
Although for them perhaps it was

143 EXT FUNERAL PYRE RUINS - DAY 143

A ruined garden surrounded by the waters of the lake
crumbling pillared porticoes and arches What must once
have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and
overgrown

Grahams friends stand watching the pyre transfixed by the
flames Manoj dressed in white stands with Gaurika He
recites a Hindi prayer

EVELYN (V0)

A body takes a long time to be
consumed Many hours for the
mourners to remember their dead
The fire must be lit at dawn and
by sunset there must be nothing
left but ash

144 EXT LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144

Stripped to the waist Manoj walks into the water holding
a bowl

EVELYN (V0)

Where do our souls go is that
all of us that is left behind
Perhaps the most we can ask is
that when we do shuffle off we
do so knowing that we were loved
Manoj pours Graham onto the water The ashes shim r and
dance caught in the gentle currents

145 EXT SERVANTS GARDEN MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 145

Muriel and Anokhi are in the servants garden Young Wasim

sits silently in the corner

MURIEL
So theres a process they call
it pickling I have no idea what
it is or how they do it but
whoever invented it was a smart
man But the real genius was the
one who introduced an onion into
the system That I could never
have thought of

Ajit looks at her ready to translate

MURIEL (CONTD)
No forget it
Muriel is looking out at the yard She sees Mrs Kapoor
talking to some surveyors Theyre mapping out the
building
Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her comes over to them

MRS KAPOOR
Mrs Donnelly what are you doing
here You should not be here
talking with this one

MURIEL
Im helping her clean If these
pots get any dirtier youll have
to serve the food with
penicillin

MRS KAPOOR
We have other rooms Go to one
of them instead While this is
still a hotel
She turns back to the surveyors
MURIEL

(TO AJIT)

He points to Young Wasim

AJIT

146 EXT ROOFTOP BAR BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL UDAIPUR - 146

EVENING
A stunning view over the city Madge is having a drink
with Norman Douglas is sitting on the wall but keeps
looking down towards the stairs

MADGE
When someone dies you think
about your own life And in my
case there is less of it in
front of me than behind And I
dont want to grow older I
dont want to be condescended to
ignored and marginalised by
society To become peripheral to
the action

(MORE )

MADGE (coat d)
I dont want to be the first
person let off the plane ina
hostage crisis
They laugh together And dont even see Douglas go

147 EXT LANDING BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 147

The landing is large and open to the sky Evelyn has just
come up the stairs to go to her room Shes leaning against
the stone baluster
DOUGLAS
I wondered where youd been

Evelyn turns Douglas is on the stairs above her

DOUGLAS (CONTD)

Were all up top having a drink

EVELYN

I went to see Gaurika Manojs
wife I wanted to ask her what
she knew And the answer was
that she knew everything that
hed loved another man and
always would He told her when
the marriage was arranged

(BEAT)
They had no secrets from each
other none

Suddenly shes crying Unable to stop

Douglas puts his arms around her

EVELYN (CONTD)

And thats right dont you see
That must be right Because what

is the point of a marriage in
which nothing is shared

and holds her to him

Her words hang in the air They stand there for a moment

Jean has come out of her room
them

JEAN
Mrs Greenslade might I have my
husband back now
They spring apart

JEAN (CONTD)
Douglas

She walks off back into the room

Evelyn goes quickly to her room leaving him standing
there

148 INT DOUGLAS AND JEANS ROOM - EVENING 148
Douglas closes the door

DOUGLAS
She was upset

JEAN
Spare me your explanations
Dyou think Im jealous

DOUGLAS
I dont see why else you would
have embarrassed me And Evelyn

JEAN

You were already doing a
perfectly good job of
embarrassing yourself Can you
imagine how ghastly its been for
everyone to watch you mooning
around after that simpering doe-
eyed ex-housewife taking
advantage of her loneliness and -

DOUGLAS
God can you hear yourself Can
you Do you have any idea what a
terrible person youve become
Jean is stunned into silence

DOUGLAS (CONTD)

All you give out is this endless
negativity a refusal to see any
kind of light and joy even when
its right in your face anda
desperate need to squash any sign
of happiness in me or anyone else

its a wonder I dont fling
myself at the first kind word or
gesture that comes my way But I
dont Out of some dried-out
notion of loyalty and respect
neither of which I ever bloody
get in return

Theres a long silence

JEAN
I checked my emails This came
She hands him a piece of paper

149 EXT ROOFTOP BAR BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 149

Evelyn comes onto the terrace and heads for Madge and
Norman She picks up Madges glass

These men are here to value the

SONNY
They are valuing the land My

MRS KAPOOR
They could just wait a month for
it to fall down of its own
accord

SONNY
You joke Mummyji but inside I

destroyed Send these people
away

MRS KAPOOR

SONNY

There is still time to turn
things around With a small
injection of funds we can -

MRS KAPOOR

Who is trusting you with that
money Eh You who cannot run
a chai stand Just like your
father

Beat Then Sonny speaks quietly

SONNY
Do I remind you of him so much
Is that why you must be cruel to
me

MRS KAPOOR
You think I am cruel

SONNY
You loved my father And he
loved this hotel

MRS KAPOOR
(FIERCELY)
Two mistakes There will not be
a third
(BEAT)

Say goodbye to all this Sonny
And come with me to Delhi Your
life will become easier

SONNY

He leaves
Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk fiddling with some
paperwork discomfited
She turns to the doorway Muriel is there in her chair

MRS KAPOOR

MURIEL

MRS KAPOOR

MURIEL
Mrs Ainslie said she had an
address where I could get some
things I need Some biscuits

line

MRS KAPOOR
I wish you luck
Mrs Kapoor smiles and leaves
Muriel watches her go then turns to the computer
Her fingers fly across the keyboard
