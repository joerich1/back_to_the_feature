Emil killed Milos

Blood sprays Taminas face She tries to run but Oleg grabs
her not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the

The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement Jordy
grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly professional
manner - hurling him down to the pavement twisting his arm
behind his back With his other hand Jordy whips out a
BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
the muggers head Jordy displays his shield

JORDY
Okay youre under arrest Now you

The roof is gone The sky is exposed Its charred ruins
smoked beams and watery muck Eddie and Leon are standing by
whats left of the mattress looking at Milos and Taminas
charred bodies Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar
listening to Leon

LEON
So it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
position - that they were doin each
other but were so whacked out of their
heads they set the pipe on the mattress
lit it up and they got fried What do
you think Eddie

Jordy enters - with Korfin whos carrying a paint can

EDDIE
I dont know We got the experts here
Show them what you found - I hope you
dont mind we came over to see if we
could help

Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
celebrity

KORFIN
Nah not at all Detective Flemming -
Bobby Korfin My Uncle Tony worked with
you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie

JORDY

holder and pockets it to finish later

LEON

Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs Korfin
shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe

LEON (CONTD)

KORFIN

Hey thats great you guys got it all
wrapped up but you dont mind if we go
through the routine It gives us
somethin to do

EDDIE
No we dont mind You mind Leon

LEON
No Go ahead

JORDY
Thanks Appreciate it

Jordy throws a look at Korfin Homicide detectives have no
respect for fire marshals investigative skills Eddie
rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
living room Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil ina
charred beam measuring how deep in it goes

KORFIN
Okay Jordy - it was a fast fire we got
good patterns - about thirty minutes
old

Jordy moves to one of the corpses He pulls on a white
rubber glove Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth The
glove comes out white

JORDY
Mouths clean too

KORFIN
Clean

JORDY
Dont blow your nose

Jordys looking at Leon who was just about to blow his nose

JORDY (CONTD)
The smokell permeate your nostrils -
burn ‘em out Let it run

KORFIN
But you knew that right

Leon looks at Jordy then lowers the handkerchief Jordy
turns back to the corpses on the bed Eddie - in the other
room - has found Taminas brushed gold bracelet on the floor

JORDY
So the way you see it two crack heads
burned themselves up

LEON
Thats what it looks like to me

JORDY
And while theyre burning up theyre
still goin down on each other You got
to hand it to them

LEON
(realizes hes wrong - blows it
off)
Yeah well some people got their
priorities straight

Leon watches Jordy quietly With a pair of tweezers Jordy

pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the

heads Korfin supplies the paint can Jordy drops the cloth
inside

LEON (CONTD)
What was that

JORDY
Evidence Of a homicide

That got Eddies attention and he comes back to the bedroom

JORDY (CONTD)
You know what that is right

EDDIE
No what is it

JORDY
Why dont you explain it Bobby
(to a fireman joking a wall
Hey Camello You mind punching a hole
in the floor

CAMELLO
No problem
(to Eddie and Leon)
Excuse me gentlemen You might wanna
back up a little more Dont wanna get
your pants wet

Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
set Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon As Camello
hacks at the floor with an ax Jordy continues to examine the
bodies and Korfin explains

KORFIN
They have not soot in their mouths
which means they werent breathin
before the fire and that usually means
they were deceased - and this piece of
cloth that my partner found means they
were wrapped up in something probably
doused with a flammable liquid and
positioned like this on the bed To the
untrained eye it looks like an
accident

Jordy kicks around the draining floor reaches down for
something

LEON
Whats he looking for

EDDIE
A timer

Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet pulls them up -
on the other end is a timer Korfin takes the timer from
Jordy and moves to Eddie

KORFIN
Here you go A big double homicide

timer Wish I had a picture of it

As the Top Story logo is splashed across the screen
accompanied by a catchy TV THEME Robert Hawkins introduces
Americas highest rated news magazine show

ROBERT HAWKINS
Good evening Im Robert Hawkins and
this is Top Story Tonight we bring you
an exclusive interview with Stephen
Geller - who horrified the nation two
years ago when he went berserk and
murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
shoe store But now Mr Gellers
claim spoken softly and articulately
is that he is the victim According to
Mr Geller the events of that fateful
day were not his fault but were the
fault of his psychiatrist Hard to
believewatch

VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil sitting

Olegs hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
volume The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew Hes
sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
stained shirt A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
background Patients peruse the paintings of weird
dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact One of the
paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson

STEPHEN GELLER
This had nothing to do with shoes that
didnt fit or my relationship with my
father who as you know made a fortune
selling penny loafers in the fifties
These people died because of the
criminal actions of my doctor

ROBERT HAWKINS
Your doctor

STEPHEN GELLER
Yes My psychiatrist didnt insist that
I stay on my medication

ROBERT HAWKINS
»-SO you feel absolutely no
responsibility for killing these people

STEPHEN GELLER
It was my finger that pulled the
trigger but Im not morally
responsible My psychiatrist knew what
I was capable of How could I know
Im not a doctor

ROBERT HAWKINS
You seem very savvy for a man whos been
found mentally incompetent to stand
trial

STEPHEN GELLER
Look Im a victim here too I was a
year away from getting my masters in
Art now Ill never graduate My life
has been permanently disrupted

ROBERT HAWKINS
Permanently disrupted Arent you

money Hasnt this incident as you
call it jump started your career as an
artist
STEPHEN GELLER
Look Im in here You call this a
career move

ROBERT HAWKINS

you understand thats why youre a
professional

JORDY

that Youre gonna jeopardize your
career your life and youre gonna

suddenly KICKS at Emils hand but Emil pulls it away
backing out of Eddies reach

EMIL
Bad last moment - I cut that out

Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddies
left temple Emil cocks the hammer but Eddie avoids the

gun ducking his head to the side of Emils arm Standing
and following his head up Emils arm and pushing him over

into the desk Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and

Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor

Oleg still grips the videocamera Eddie continues around
with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
him to the wall

Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
Emil is limping for it Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
repeatedly

Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
from the wall Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
onto the sofa Falling on top of him rolling over and
leaving Oleg on the sofa

Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
gun Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
not clear in the darkness who has the gun

Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
videocamera Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
window and one of the lampshades off the lamp
Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
the stomach

Emil steps back revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIES
STOMACH

Eddie stumbles backward falling over but still attached to
the chair - holding the gun Eddie cant believe he got
stabbed Blood swells around his stomach He cant be
dying This cant be happening He looks at Emil The pain
is terrible Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
close up

Emil looks at Eddie

ask why Why are we showing something
so journalist I must show it A
democracy survives through the freedom
of its media and if we cannot see what
is happening then we dont deserve our
democracy or our freedom Eddie
Flemming was my friend I cried when I
watched this footage and vowed to fight
this violence with every molecule of my
being from this day onward Hopefully
this will have a similar effect on you

CUTLER
-my client was suffering from a major
illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
during times of intense stress as a
result of paranoid and psychotic
delusions - there was impairment of his
ability to appreciate wrongfullness
This is a victory for the mentally ill

Emil - his hand in his pocket We notice in the crowd Max
the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac Whats he doing here

Maxs hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket A weird gleam
in his eye We see Korfin in the group speaking to other
cops Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
place in the mass She watches Emil with quiet rage Cutler
continues

CUTLER (CONTD)
before Emil boards the police boat
and heads for Rykers Island where he
will be checked into the psyche ward I
want to say one last word to you all
As you know Emil was coerced by Oleg
Razgul into committing these murders
yet Oleg is still out in the street a
free man filming gruesome murders My
client and I hope he is brought to
justice in the near future

They are through the monuments approaching the steps when
Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - whos checking his watch
obsessively
