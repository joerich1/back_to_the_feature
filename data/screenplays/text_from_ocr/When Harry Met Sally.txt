Because what happens is the person
youre involved with doesnt
understand why you need to be friends
with the person youre friends with
like it must mean somethings missing
from your relationship and you have
to go outside to get it and when you
say no no its not true theres
nothing missing from our relationship
the person youre involved with accuses
you of being secretly attracted to
the person youre just friends with

JESS
When did this happen

HARRY

Priday Helen comes home she says
I don‘t know if I want to be married
any more You know like its the
institution like its nothing personal
like its just something shes thinking
about in a kind of casual way Im calm
I say why dont we think about it
take some time dont rush into anything
Next day she says shes thought about it
she wants a trial separation She just
wants to try it she says We can still
date she says like this is supposed to
cushion the blow I mean I got married
so I could stop dating so I dont see
where “we can still date is a big incentive
since as far as Im concerned the last
thing you want to do is date your wife
whos supposed to love you wnich is
what Im saying to her when it crosses
my mind maybe she doesnt so I say
Dont you love me anymore“ and you
know what she says I dont know if
Ive ever loved you

When Joe and I started seeing each

but we werent going to get married

because every time everyone we knew

got married it ruined their relationship

they practically never had sex again

Its true its one of the secrets no

one ever tells you I would sit around

with my girlfriends who had kids --

well actually my one girlfriend who

had kids Alice and she would complain

about how she and Gary never did it

any more She didnt even complain about
soe oe non EE Now that I-think about it she just 9770
said it matter-of-factly They were up
all night they were both exhausted all
the timethe kids just took
every sexual impulse they had out of them
and Joe and I used to talk about it and
say were so lucky we have this wonderful
relationship we can have sex on the kitchen
floor and not worry about the kid walking
in we can fly off to Rome on a moments
notice and then one day I was taking
Alices little girl for the afternoon Id
promised to take her to the circus and we
were in a cab playing I Spy -- you know
I spy a lamppost I spy a mailbox -- and she
looked out the window and there was this
man and this woman with two little kids
the man had one of the kids on his shoulders
and Alices little girl said I spy a
family“ and I started to cry You know
I just started crying and I went home

get cold when its 62 degrees out

order a sandwich I even loved when
you used my sweater for a kleenex I
love it that after spending the day with
you I can still smell your perfume on
my clothes I love how youre the last
person I want to talk to before I go
to sleep at night It took me
eleven years to figure this out And
I came here tonight because when you
realize you want to spend the rest of
your life with someone you want the rest
of your life to start as soon as possible

HARRY
My whole life I have never known
what this song means

forgot Does that mean we should
forget old acquaintances or does
it mean if we do happen to forget
them we should remember them
