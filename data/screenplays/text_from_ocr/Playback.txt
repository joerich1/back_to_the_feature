INT STREAMLINER IN MOTION - CORRIDOR -- DAY
SHOWING OPEN DOORS OF FOUR ROOMETTES

Through the windows can be seen the landscape through which
the train is passing In the first roomette counting from
the left is a well-dressed rather wise-looking FEMALE
young smart She is making up her face

In the second is a middle-aged couple a CANADIAN
IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR and a CANADIAN CUSTOMS INSPECTOR

In the third BETTY MAYFIELD is seated near the window
turning over the pages of a magazine She is about 27 years
old beautiful blonde and has a remote troubled
expression as though her thoughts were far away

The fourth is empty There is a mans suitcase in evidence
on the seat LARRY MITCHELL enters from the left He is
tall good-looking young with superficial charm and rather
too much self-assurance

He glances in at the woman in the first roomette stops in
the door and leans against it

We MOVE IN so this scene becomes a SHOT of a single
roomette OVER SCENE is HEARD the voices of the Canadian
Immigration Officer

her face in a pocket mirror Tea wagon and maids move away

Im getting positively haggard
In a couple of years people will
be describing me as well preserved

CLARENDON
(looking off)

with us again

Margos hand stops in mid-air holding mirror She looks
up slowly

MARGO
I couldnt care less

Just the same she sees in which direction Clarendon is
looking and starts to turn

my eyes dont deceive me at this
distance

Margo reacts and swings around CAMERA PANNING

with lighter She puffs at it furiously looking out of

Shes very beautiful Shes much
younger than I am And shes rich

torn up an unhappy marriage I was
able to do her a small favor

MARGO
Splendid Now she can return the
compliment

She crosses the desk gets bag gets keys out unlocks the
desk drawer and jerks it open takes something out and
turns holding it in her hand Two checks

MARGO
She can give you enough money to
cover these and the other bad

checks youve given me
Mitchell comes up to her slowly looks down at the checks

MITCHELL
I hoped to get enough to cover
them before they cleared I wasnt
lucky

MARGO
You know what would happen to you
if I turned these over to the
police

MITCHELL
(quietly)
I have a rough idea

MARGO
Youd go to jail For a long term

MITCHELL
Correct I couldnt even afford to
pay a lawyer to defend me

A beat They stare at each other

MITCHELL
Whatll we do about it Margo

MARGO

She is much younger than I am
Thats something Im going to have
to get used to Isnt it Larry

checks)

looking at her A sob catches in her throat

MARGO

you Larry What an idiot

He reaches to take her in his arms First she pushes him
off then yields He pulls her close and kisses her Then
as they come out of the kiss

MITCHELL
Ive always been a heel I guess I
always will be

MARGO
You dont have to make a pose of
it

MITCHELL

Its the only pose I have left
Im sunk Broke I dont even have
my hotel bill

MARGO
(a little sharply)
I seem to recognize this routine
First the kiss then the touch
(she makes a hopeless
gesture)

Oh whats the use Youre you

She turns and moves towards the desk

MARGO
I only have a couple of hundred

She picks her bag up holds it out He comes up beside
her

MARGO

the garden terrace walks slowly across the lobby People
are looking at her with interest specially the men As

is a bar but it is only for the use of the waiters Betty
looks around for a vacant table then starts moving along
looking for one None empty but at one sits a MAN alone
He is about 35 clean fine drawn type with a saturnine
expression He glances up Betty meets his eyes starts to
turn away Man indicates the chair opposite him His manner
of doing this is so completely indifferent to her as a
person that she hesitates

BRANDON
(standing up)
You can have the table yourself
if youd rather Im only killing
time

BETTY
No please

BRANDON
Sit down then We often have a
double up here

BETTY
I see

She pulls the chair back sits down Brandon sits down He
lights a cigarette doesnt offer her one She is watching
him a little puzzled probably has had very few experiences
of men not trying to pick her up in such circumstances
Betty looks around at the scurrying WAITERS who pay no
attention to her yet

indifferently)

Martini

BETTY
As I said before

BRANDON
Sure But Id hate like the Dickens
to be held to everything Ive said
before wouldnt you

Betty suddenly laughs The waiter brings the glass and the
bottle of bass ale sets them down in front of her Brandon

makes a motion and the waiter goes away without collecting

BETTY
Youre not paying for this Its
quite enough that you let me sit
at your table

BRANDON
I never pay for anything They
just keep me here to amuse the
guests

BETTY
And do you amuse the guests

BRANDON
No
(indicating her
bottle of ale)
Are you really going to drink that
stuff

BETTY

almost untouched
glass)

Martini myself

BETTY

BRANDON
Whatever you say

BETTY

BRANDON

(standing up and

putting money on

the table)
I dont know you and you dont
know me I made a reasonably polite
suggestion But Im sure youd
rather be alone

BETTY
I hate to be alone But Ive heard
all the approaches there are
even yours

Brandon turns back stares down at her coldly

BRANDON
Neatly saidbut to the wrong
man The trouble with pretty girls
is that they cant imagine anyone
thinking of anything else but the
fact they are pretty girls I get
tired of it

BETTY

BRANDON

The two men glare at each other Mitchell finally shrugs

And everything has changed except Bettys expression The
FLASHES go on but they are now seen to be FLASHBULBS of
NEWSPAPER CAMERAMEN Betty is dressed very soberly and is
standing just inside the door of a courtroom with a jail
matron beside her

The CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK AWAY FROM BETTY and the
entire courtroom is seen

It is late at night in the county courthouse GREENWATER
NORTH CAROLINA There is an excited buzzing of conversation
A BAILIFF is RAPPING for order

The JURY is sitting grim faced and silent in the box
The Judge is not on the bench yet

Betty is led along the side corridor then through the bar
where DEFENSE ATTORNEY a haggard dark-haired young man
stands waiting for her

(NOTE All Southern accents except Bettys in this scene)

BAILIFF
(shouting)
Everybody stand up His Honor
Judge Hopkinson Court now in
session

Everybody stands up Betty and the jail matron and the
young attorney face towards the bench

CAMERA SHOWS THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY also standing up at
his table

CAMERA PANS OVER TO THE DOOR OF THE JUDGES CHAMBERS He
walks slowly to the bench stands for a moment behind it
looking out over the courtroom then sits down He is a
distinguished courtly Southerner of the best type an old
man but very erect When he sits all the spectators and
lawyers sit down

The double doors at the back are closed and a BAILIFF stands
with his back to them Suddenly one of the doors is pushed
open almost knocking the Bailiff out of the way

He turns angrily as HENRY KINSOLVING enters The Bailiff
seeing who it is stands aside Henry Kinsolving is an
arrogant bitter man about 60 years old with the stamp of
power and authority He marches down the center aisle of
the court through the bar and sits at the table near the
PROSECUTOR The Judge stares down at him coldly

JUDGE
Mr Bailiff please make room for
Mr Henry Kinsolving outside the
bar of the court

Henry Kinsolving springs to his feet and glares at the
Judge Then he turns and goes through the gate of the bar
and sits down outside in a chair the Bailiff places for
him solicitously There is a general shuffling of feet and
noise which subsides slowly

JUDGE

(slowly and

impressively)
Before the Jury renders its verdict
the Court wishes to warn those
present that there is to be no
demonstrations of any kind No
person is to leave the courtroom
until the Court rises

(he glances towards

press table)
I repeat no one is to leave the
courtroom

There is a silence then the Judge turns towards the Clerk

JUDGE
You may proceed Mr Clerk
CLERK
(he stands and looks
at Elizabeth)
The Defendant will rise and face
the Jury

ELIZABETH stands up slowly and turns towards

the Jury who

do not look at her They stare somewhere over her head

The Clerk turns back to the Jury

CLERK
Gentlemen of the Jury have you

There is a surge of noise in the well of the

court The

Judge raps sharply with his gavel A couple of PRESSMEN

start to get up then look back and see that

the doors are

guarded and sit down again The Prosecutor looks grimly
satisfied he glances at the DEFENDING COUNCIL with a half
smile Defense Counsel whose name is LEAMINGTON is shocked

and pale Elizabeth shows no reaction at all
Kinsolving draws his mouth a little tighter
a gleam in his eye The Spectators look for
very satisfied Leamington comes to his feet

LEAMINGTON
(in a strangled
voice)
Motion to pool the Jury if it

BAILIFF
Order in the Court

JUDGE
The Court now has a statement to
make

He glances towards Elizabeth who is still standing rigidly

Elizabeth

JUDGE
(gently)
Please sit down Mrs Kinsolving

sits and clasps her hands in front of her

JUDGE
This court like most courts has
occasionally been guilty of judicial
error Prior to the commencement
of this trail Mr Leamington as
attorney for the Defendant made a
motion for a change of venue on
the ground that a fair trial could
not be had by this Defendant in
this jurisdiction Most of you
know why this motion was made
The Defendant was alleged to have
been tried and convicted in the
columns of the daily newspaper
owned by her father-in-law Mr
Henry Kinsolving and as a result
public opinion was said to have
been prejudiced to the extent that
it was doubtful twelve Jurors could
be found with open minds This
Court regretfully denied the motion
It did not believe that a Jury
with open minds could not be found
The members of this Jury declared
on oath that their minds were open
The Court had no reason at that
time to disbelieve them

The Judge looks at the Jury sternly and they react in

various ways The Judges eyes go to Henry Kinsolving

stares back at him

who

JUDGE

Elizabeth Kinsolving has been tried
and found guilty of murder of her
husband Lee Kinsolving Lee

Kinsolving

was the only son of our

most prominent citizen Mr

Kinsolving

controls or is said to

control our leading bank many of
our business enterprises and our

only daily
employment

newspaper He affords
to a large number of

our citizens His influence on our

affairs is

very great

(dramatic pause)

Perhaps to

great

There is an upsurge of noise in the Court and the Bailiff
shots for order Prosecutor jumps to his feet

Your Honor
statement

PROSECUTOR
I protest that

JUDGE

Sit down Mr Prosecutor Your are
out of order

Prosecutor swallows
and sits down again

looks back at Henry Kinsloving shrugs

Leamington is leaning forward with a

gleam in his eye Elizabeth is still deadpan

We all new

JUDGE
Lee Kinsolving well We

watched him grow up We observed
that he was proud and hot tempered
and had a strain of arrogance not
unlike others of his family

He looks meaningfully at Henry Kinsolving

JUDGE

From this town Lee Kinsolving went

to fight for his country

And to

this town

before he went overseas

he brought the wife he had married
up North To us he returned a war
hero badly wounded condemned for
the rest of his life to wear a
heavy brace around his neck
Competent medical testimony has
shown that without that brace a
very slight movement might have
been enough to snap his spinal
cord This injury humiliated and
embittered Lee Kinsolving made

him morose and violent and perhaps
caused him to drink to excess The
Defendant has admitted that there
were bitter quarrels between herself
and her husband Such a quarrel
took place on the night of his
death Upon the manner of that
death this entire proceeding rests

The Judge pauses and looks out over the courtroom which
is very quiet now He pours himself a glass of water and
takes a drink from it

JUDGE

In my summing up to the Jury I
emphasized that the case for the
prosecution was as so many murder
cases are purely circumstantial
It was alleged that while Lee
Kinsolving slept perhaps ina
drunken stupor and perhaps not
the Defendant removed the neck
brace from his neck and jerked his
head sufficiently to rupture the
spinal cord and cause death It is
admitted that the Defendant was
found holding the neck brace in
her hand and bending over her
husbands body which was lying on
the bed Not in the bed mind you
but sprawled across it The
Defendant has testified that lee
Kinsolving himself removed the
neck brace to torment her as it
were with the great danger in
hich this placed him Then he
tarted to walk towards her holding
he brace in his hands and that
eing unsteady on his feet he
tumbled and fell backwards across
he bed And this fall broke his
eck although at the time she did
ot know it She has testified
hat she picked the brace up from
he floor and was about to attempt
to replace it on his neck when her
father-in-law entered the room and
found her in that position

(a beat)
By its verdict the Jury declared
that Elizabeth Kinsolvings account
of the death of her husband to be

tot pptnotne

impossible of belief
The Judge sips a little more water then continues

JUDGE
In all murder trails a motion by
the Defense for a directed verdict
of acquittal before the case goes
to the Jury is more or less
automatic It is usually
perfunctory and for that reason
immediately denied The laws of
this state and a few other
jurisdictions confer upon a Court
a right to reserve its ruling upon
such a motion until after the Jury
has rendered its verdict In this
proceeding I as presiding Judge
availed myself of this power I
most honestly hoped that the Jury
in this case might act as
impartially as it declared itself
to be

The Prosecuting Attorney again jumps to his feet then
changes his mind sits down with a frustrated angry
movement Kinsolving is leaning forward glaring The Jury
are now very uncomfortable The is a BUZZ OF NOISE and the
Bailiff again shouts for order

JUDGE

Let me remind you that a Jury is
the sole Judge of fact and further
let me remind you that the Jury
must judge all the facts It may
not select nor create nor change
facts It may only interpret them
It may not declare something
impossible which in fact is merely
extremely difficult to believe

(a beat)
Impossible is a very big word

(another beat)
If we believe Elizabeth Kinsolvings
sworn testimony we must also
believe that Lee Kinsolving
performed an act which was almost
certain to cause his death It is
difficult very difficult to
believe But is it impossible Are
we sure that he knew it would cause
his death Or that in his then
state of mind he even considered
the consequences at all Many people
have attempted suicide as a result
of domestic quarrels Not all have
succeeded nor meant to succeed
And surely not all those who did
succeed fully intended to Not
all knew what they were doing and
those who did know there were
surely a few whose desire to hurt
others overcame their fear of
hurting themselves We cannot
know what was in Lee Kinsolvings
Mind Therefore some element of
doubt must infallibly remain It
was not necessary for this Jury to
declare its belief in the
Defendants innocence nor to
declare its that Lee Kinsolving by
accident or his own intent It was
necessary for the Jury to admit to
themselves as reasonable men the
possibility however slight
that Elizabeth Kinsolvings story
was true This possibility the
Jury has refused to admit
(dramatic pause)
It therefore becomes my duty to
declare that such a possibility
does in fact exist and the Jurys
refusal to recognize it was a
failure to exercise it proper
function

A rising antagonistic sound begins to surge from the

spectators and Henry Kinsolving comes to his feet slowly

and rigidly The Judge ignore him and looks straight at

the foreman of the Jury and speaks the rest of his speech

in a clear ringing dominating voice

JUDGE

The Court therefore rules that the
motion of the Attorney for the
Defense for a directed verdict of
not guilty be now granted The
verdict of guilty brought by this
Jury is herby set aside anda
verdict of not guilty is to be
entered on the record

(his voice bow rises

almost to a shout)
And the Defendant Elizabeth
Kinsolving is here with discharged
from custody of the Sheriff of
this county

PANDEMONIUM and UPROAR in the Court The Bailiff shouts
for order The Judge stands slowly looks a moment out
over the Court then looks at Elizabeth smiles at her
faintly turns and starts back towards his chambers

CAMERA PANS over to Henry Kinsolving He stands like a
statue an icy rage his face working while behind him
the noise of the spectators goes on Kinsolving turns his
head towards Elizabeth then moves stiffly over to her

CAMERA PANNING he comes over to her Leamington the
Defense Attorney and the matron are standing beside her

KINSLOVING

(with restrained

fury)
For four years I endured your
presence in my house although I
well knew you were no fit wife for
my son That he had married in
haste and that he would repent it
bitterly if he survived the war I
had no thought that he would die
under his own roof nor that the
reward of my patience would be to
stand beside his grave I have
done my best to avenge him So far
I have failed But I have not
finished You are free to go where
you will but there will be another
day of reckoning somewhere
sometime And when that day comes
I will be there And that time you
will not escape

Elizabeths eyes widen with horror In the background the
crowd is still roaring like peals of thunder

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE TO ELIZABETHS EYES as at the

granted Heres the gun

He takes it out of his pocket and holds it out on a
handkerchief Killaine takes the gun from him handkerchief
and all

KILLAINE
Pearl-handled 25 Automatic uh
(he looks a little
closer)
No its a Belgian gun 66 mm
GORE
Correct Inspector A womans gun
US 125 caliber ammunition in it
It was on a table in there

He nods towards room Killaine frowns

GORE
Nobodys been questioned yet You
noticed the wound entry

Killaine nods

GORE

Much too low for a suicide Not
conclusive of course But a woman
of ordinary height standing rather
close to a tall man such as he
was

(indicating corpse)
would be apt to shoot him about
where he got shot

Killaine nods again

GORE
Then theres the shell

He takes out a small envelope hands it to Killaine

GORE

This make of gun throws a shell
backwards high and to the right
The chaise is only about four feet
from the wall

KILLAINE
So the shell ought to have gone
over

GORE

Unless the gun was slanted up

KILLAINE
So the wound and the shell give
you the same answer

GORE
Right A clean deduction from
observed facts Theyve got to be
simple once in a while Inspector

KILLAINE
(dryly)
Ive always looked forward to it
All right lets get him out of
here and tidy up
He starts to turn away

GORE
Id take a look in her clothes
closet if I were you Inspector

Killaine nods and exits scene

Thank you

He moves to Margo holds gun in front of her

KILLAINE
Mr West

Margos eyes go down very slowly She stares at the gun
for a long moment before speaking

MARGO
(in a choked voice)
I never saw it before

KILLAINE
Positive

Margo lifts her face to him and nods

KILLAINE
Thank you

BRANDON
Yes Ive seen it before

Killaine reacts sharply Killaine catches the reaction
with the corner of his eye but appears not to pay any
attention Brandon obviously does see the reaction
Killaine turns back to Brandon

KILLAINE
Where

BRANDON
On Miss Mayfields balcony beside
the chaise I picked it up Dont
ask me why I ought to know better

KILLAINE
Quite sure you had no motive
Killaine glances sidewise at Betty

BRANDON
Could be

KILLAINE
I rather thought so And before
that had you ever seen the gun

BRANDON
No

Margo is seen to react with great relief which she tries
to conceal Killaine gives another quick sidelong look
Brandon has continued to watch her

KILLAINE
(to Brandon)
It was lying where on the balcony

BRANDON
Near his right hand About a foot
away Perhaps more Good heavens
one doesnt use a tape measure

KILLAINE
We do when we get the chance

Killaine turns so that he faces Margo and Clarendon

KILLAINE
I neednt keep you any longer Mr
Clarendon

CLARENDON

(standing up)
Thank you It is rather late

night

MARGO
What about me

KILLAINE
Not quiet yet

He crosses and opens door Clarendon goes out Killaine
shuts door goes to Margo

KILLAINE
You knew Mitchell pretty well
didnt you Mrs West

MARGO
I was in love with him which
shows you the quality of my brains
(bursting out--

ooking at Betty)

Why dont you ask her about the
gun

KILLAINE

I shall From your knowledge of
Mitchell would you say he would
be likely to commit suicide

MARGO

Anybody could commit suicide if
he felt low enough Ive felt it
myself

KILLAINE
Then why not give Miss Mayfield
the benefit of the doubt

MARGO
Id be delighted to anytime you
can show me the doubt Ill wrap
it up in tissue paper and put a
Christmas seals on it for her

KILLAINE
Thank you very much Mrs West

Margo flounces to door jerks it open before anybody can
get there to hold it for her and goes out banging the
door after her

BRANDON
How about a cup of coffee

KILLAINE
No thanks I had some How would
you like to take a walk for say
half and hour

Brandon glances at Betty then back at Killaine Shrugs

BRANDON
All right

He crosses gets hat and coat goes to door and out
Killaine turns to Betty

KILLAINE
Mrs West is a very emotional woman

BETTY
I dont know her or particularly
want to

KILLAINE

You probably know the type You
find them in hotels and resorts
all over the world They always
have clothes and money and usually
have had three or four husbands
They dress and enamel themselves
with great care They worry a great
deal about those little lines at
the corner of the eyes And they
demonstrate their incompetence at
the art of living bet getting mixed
up with people like Larry Mitchell
(a beat)
Tell me about yourself Miss
Mayfield

BETTY
I was born in New York City I
grew up And here I am

KILLAINE
Ill have to know a little more
than that

BETTY

Im sorry thats all there is

KILLAINE
Miss Mayfield the humor of the
situation escapes me Within 24
hours I shall know officially
whether Mitchell was murdered
Privately Im quite sure of it
now It happened in your room and
you came to Vancouver with him
At any rate he made your hotel
reservation And you arrived
together Here in this room he
behaved nastily to you and you
said something to him which might
be taken as a threat A few hours
later he was found dead on your
balcony Would it be too much too
suggest that all these circumstances
taken together are a little
suspicious

Betty doesnt answer

KILLAINE
Please answer my question

BETTY
You didnt ask a question You
made a speech

KILLAINE
Thats an evasion and you know it
BETTY
It is

Their eyes meet in a long stare

man seated in a chair Door opens Margo is silhouetted
against corridor light She switches light on shuts door
turns and reacts violently Clarendon is sitting in chair
with his cane between his knees CAMERA PANS her over to
Clarendon

MARGO
(tensely)
What are you doing here

CLARENDON
I dont think you locked your door

MARGO
What do you want

CLARENDON
See how easy it is Perhaps Miss
Mayfield left her door unlocked
Or if she didnt theres a passkey
on every floor in the linen room
The head porter has a passkey The
bell captain has a passkey The
hotels full of passkeys

MARGO

Passkey

CLARENDON
Or--since one is a well-known and
respected guest--one could go to
the desk in the lobby and say Miss
Mayfield seems to have lost her
room key--have you another They
always have another

MARGO
Dont be a fool I loved him He
wasnt worth it but I loved him

CLARENDON
And now that hes safe from all
other women you can go on loving
him

MARGO
You nasty sardonic--—
CLARENDON
Sardonic if you will my dear
Bust nasty You lied about the
gun

Margo reacts shocked Clarendon gets slowly to his feet

CLARENDON
Im a very observant man You had
something in your bag this
afternoon Something that causes
you to hold it in a particular
way Something that made a
particular sound when you put it
down on the bar You went out with
Mitchell None of us ever saw him
again

MARGO
(desperately)
Thats not enough

CLARENDON
I saw your face this evening when
the detective showed you the gun
You lied It was obvious

MARGO
He saw my face too

CLARENDON
So he did--but he hasnt told you
what he saw I have

MARGO
Theyll arrest that girl
Everything points to her

CLARENDON
Convenient isnt it

He starts towards the door

MARGO
One of these days youre going to
wake up in the middle of the night
and find that youve cut your
throat

CLARENDON
How clumsy Id never forgive
myself Good night my dear

MARGO
You could have got in that room
just as you got in here How do I
know you didnt kill Larry
CLARENDON
With what motive

MARGO
Nastiness Youre nasty with words
Why wouldnt you be nasty with
deeds once in a while You hated
him--and I know why

CLARENDON
He was very easy to hate If youll
look in your mirror when you are
in a better temper- youll know
why

Margo just stares at him

CLARENDON
Very silly of me isnt it Im
not as well-off as I was once- and
Im used to my little comforts

He exits Margo looks after him thunderstruck

it in front of her

KILLAINE

BETTY
Yes

KILLAINE

Wheres you get it

BETTY
A graduation present

Killaine puts the gun back in his pocket
KILLAINE
Thats a rather inferior grade
humor But since youre being so
frank would you mind telling me
why all the labels have been removed
from your clothes

Betty is jarred She doesnt answer

KILLAINE
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a
sufficient reason for that

BETTY
Why dont you arrest me and be
done with it

KILLAINE
I probably shall--after Ive
tortured you a little more

Good night Miss Mayfield Do let
me thank you for your cooperation

BETTY
Theres one thing I may as well
tell you Youll find it out anyhow
I tried to run away--when I found
him out there on the balcony There

There isnt a thing in the joint that could be damaged by
being dropped out of a third-story window At one table

empty glass in front of him He sits very straight vacant
eyed stupid drunk A chunky grim-looking character ina
dinner jacket comes by table pauses to glance at sailor
makes a signal to girl who nods CAMERA PANS him across

out of his pocket looks at it puts it back keeping his
hand on it opens the door and stars in

Goble reaches a hand into his pocket throws a card on the
desk Magruder picks it up reads it

MAGRUDER
Mr Brandon couldnt be here He
might have left something for you
What would it look like

GOBLE
One of those nice long manila
envelopes--sealed Not too fat-
not too thin

MAGRUDER
What do I get for it

GOBLE
You get its brother

MAGRUDER
Sounds like a fair swap Lets
take a look

He jerks open the drawer of his desk Gobble stiffens
his hand on the gun Magruder takes out a long sealed
envelope throws it on the desk

MAGRUDER
I need a receipt Sign your name
across the flap

GOBLE
Open it and count it

MAGRUDER
When you sign for it you count
it Its your dough

He picks up a desk pen holds it out Goble hesitates

then takes his right hand holding the gun out of his pocket
lays the gun down on the desk beside the envelope He
takes the pen leans down to write At that instant
Magruder lunges up swiftly grabs Gobles right wrist with
his left hand and jerks him forward hard Goble tries to
reach the gun with his left hand Magruder grabs an old-
fashioned round ebony ruler up off the desk and smacks
Gobles hard on the head with it twice Goble sprawls
across the desk limp Magruder takes the gun puts it in
his pocket picks up the envelope tears it open and shakes
out the money counts it

MAGRUDER
Eight hundred bucks Ice cream
for dinner
Magruder picks the gun up balances it on his hand

MOVE IN ON THE GUN

It is a 32 caliber revolver with part of the barrel sawed
off to make it a belly gun It has no front sight

Magruder stares down at it PULL AWAY as he turns pulls
open desk drawer puts gun in it shuts drawer He rounds
the desk reaches inside Gobles pocket pulls out a thick
manila envelope stands looking down at it speculating
tries the flap to see if it will come loose

MOVE IN TO SHOW THERE IS NO WRITING ON THE ENVELOPE

He picks up the envelope which contained money It is

also manila and about the same size With a quick decision
Magruder tears open GOBLES ENVELOPE draws out a sheaf of
blank paper Magruder whistles lightly between his teeth
turns his head to state at Goble who is still limp sprawled
across the desk

MAGRUDER

(softly)
You had it coming didnt you
baby

(reaches across

shakes Gobles

shoulders)
Come on Youre not that sick

Goble does not respond Magruder pulls his head and
shoulder up on the desk The head sags to one side
Magruder presses a thumb against one of Gobles eyeballs
No reaction Magruder bends close stares and is suddenly
stiff with fear

MAGRUDER
(hoarsely)
Dont tell me you had a glass head
baby Oh no--not in your business
How could you live so long

He lets go of Goble who sways sideways in the chair his
head hanging like that of a broken doll As Magruder stares
down at him with very much the sort of frozen horror as

we saw on Bettys face when she found Mitchells body on

the balcony

KILLAINE
Remember that time didnt I
Good morning Mrs West Does your
visit here mean youve changed
your mind

MARGO
(startled)

How did you know
(Killaine smiles
slightly doesnt
answer)

Clarendon

(Killaine still
doesnt answer)

You cops never tell anybody

anything do you

KILLAINE
Other people always know so much
more than we know--so much more
than theyre willing to tell us

MARGO
It was Clarendon He knew I had
the gun in my bag

Killaine just stares

MARGO
You couldnt possible have traced
it this soon--not possibly

KILLAINE
(dryly)
Of course not Thanks for telling
me I havent seen Mr Clarendon

MARGO
I am a fool

KILLAINE
That depends upon your motive
You were in love with Mitchell
werent you

MARGO
Yes--and hes already becoming
vague to me Funny Last night I
was furiously jealous Jealous of
what I out that gun in my bag
deliberately Who was I going to
kill with it A girl I didnt
even know A man I knew to be a
thief and a forger A half-man
A gigolo Its already ludicrous
Love What a comedy

KILLAINE
You didnt play it for laughs last
night

MARGO
Did you ever have a serious
operation

KILLAINE
Mortar shells are not funny either

MARGO

At first it doesnt hurt at all
Thats shock Then it hurts
erribly--you wouldnt believe
uch pain could exist--and six
onths later you cant remember

KILLAINE
Ill investigate Mr Clarendons
financial position--

MARGO
I dont understand
KILLAINE
Perhaps a rich widow would have
solved all his problems

MARGO
Now youre being beastly

KILLAINE

Sure You didnt come here in
person just to tell me about the
gun You wanted me to be looking
across the desk at you while you
talked about Mitchell

(he pauses Margo

nods--admiration

in her eyes)
If I believe you it would be
psychologically impossible for you
to have killed him last night

MARGO
And if you didnt believe me

KILLAINE
You would still have planted
information that Clarendon knew
about the gun--and not as an
accusation but in the process of
defending yourself by making a
confession Very neat Good

Senior Young Mitchells father
He just flew in from Toronto

KILLAINE

How do you do sir

Mitchell nods

MCKECHNIE
Ive explained the situation to
Mr Mitchell up to a point Now
about this Mayfield girl

KILLAINE
Shes a suspect naturally But
not the only one

MCKECHNIE
(harshly)
Shes the only one who had a dead
man in her room The only one who

wont give an account of herself
The only one who tried to run away
And the only one so far Ive
been told who went to such lengths
to disguise her identity that she
even removed the labels from her
clothes What more do you want

MITCHELL SR
She should have been arrested last
night

MCKECHNIE
Thats as may be
(to Killaine)
Weve ample grounds to detain her
for questioning You cant deny
that surely

KILLAINE
No
MCKECHNIE
I hear shes a very pretty girl

KILLAINE
Which forces me to arrest her
against my better judgment

MCKECHNIE
Aye You have a point there

MITCHELL SR
If so I must say that it escapes
my attention It is my son who
has been murdered He was not
always a good son--but he was my
son I want his murderer punished
The girls obviously a criminal of
some sort Otherwise shed give
an account of herself Arrest
her and youll find out soon
enough

MCKECHNIE
(eyeing Killaine)
I think hes right

KILLAINE

Am I to interpret that as an order
to arrest Miss Mayfield

MCKECHNIE

When I give an order youll not
need it interpreted

up

Well are ye satisfied Mr

Everybody loves a guard mount--
except the guard

(looks back)
My boss gave me an hour to make up
my mind The times almost up

For the first time in the scene Betty turns and faces
him

KILLAINE
Im about to be very silly A man
passes a girl on the street--a
very lovely girl--his eyes meet
her eyes and something reaches
out and takes hold of his heart--
and then she goes on and is lost
in the crowd--and he says to
himself There goes my lost love--
and its true--if he never sees
her again its still true Of
course after a while he forgets--
or almost forgets--because after a
while we forget almost everything
(Betty is silent
staring at him)
But this man is a copper He gets
orders--routine orders--to go to a
place and investigate a murder--
and everything points to a certain
girl

BETTY
Points very straight to her

KILLAINE
He looks at the girl looks into
her eyes--—

BETTY
What does he see

KILLAINE

Palm trees against a sunset--waves
breaking on a coral reef--the Taj
Mahal by moonlight--roses in an
English garden just after a shower--

(he grins wryly)
Clichés one and all--but good
ones with a lot of mileage left
in them--theres one thing he does
not see--murder--and murder was
what he was sent to find Pretty
ridiculous isnt it

BETTY
Very ridiculous

KILLAINE
Thats my hard luck--Im man enough
to tell you about it--and not be
sorry

BETTY

What do your friends call you--
The ones that know you well--and
like you very much

KILLAINE
They call me Jeff

BETTY
Jeff Shall we go now Jeff and
get it over with

KILLAINE

Not quiet yet

(pause)
We know who the gun belonged to
Margo West She told us this
morning
(pause)
It doesnt mean much Mitchell
took it away from her He had a
habit of going through her bag

BETTY
Looking for peanuts I suppose

KILLAINE
So Mitchell had handled it
Afterwards Brandon picked it up
(he glances at her)
Theres no indication you handled
it

BETTY
I always wear gloves when I shoot
people A bad joke--but better
than tears

KILLAINE
(glancing at his
watch again)
Times up Im off the case
(he takes a deep
breath)

BETTY
Theyll only find someone else--
who wont be so kind

KILLAINE
Thats something I cant spare
you But I wont do it myself

BETTY
Because you think your in love
with me

KILLAINE
Im enough of a copper to do my
duty My boss made it tough for
me If I dont arrest you Ive
gone soft If I do its to save
my face I dont play those rules
He breaks off PIPE MUSIC SOUNDS OVER SCENE Killaine
raises his voice

KILLAINE
Youve got a couple of hours maybe

BETTY
To do what

KILLAINE
I cant answer that

BETTY
What will they do to you

KILLAINE
Thats theyre business Can I
drop you somewhere

BETTY
Youre still a police officer
Jeff
(pause)
I saw you send those two men away
I know they were watching me

Killaine stares at her silently

BETTY
What are you going to do--toss
your job into Puget Sound Because
I make you think of magnolias I
thought policeman was something
like a soldier That his duty
came first However much he might
happen hate it

KILLAINE
(steadily)
Ive been a soldier too There is
a difference A policeman like a
judge has a right to disqualify
himself on proper grounds

BETTY
What proper grounds
(pause Killaine
doesnt answer)
You cant be in love with me You
hardly know me Im not in love
with you

KILLAINE
I know that

BETTY
But even if you were in love with
me

KILLAINE
(almost rudely)
Theres an empty taxi across the
street If youre so anxious
take it Hell know the way to
the police headquarters

BETTY
You do things the hard way dont
you

KILLAINE
Sometimes

BETTY

Not sometimes Always Just
because it is the hard way Youre
that kind of man Jeff

tried to help her get away--
BRANDON
Would that make me a heel

KILLAINE
Youd be breaking the law

BRANDON

KILLAINE
The only answer I have for you

BRANDON
You passed up a dozen chances to
arrest her What toughened you
up

KILLAINE
Information

BRANDON
Dont kid me You dont think she
murdered Mitchell

KILLAINE
It could have been an accident

BRANDON
That COULD BE TOLD

KILLAINE
Not if she knew she wouldnt be
believed

act he put on up here is it likely
shed let him in

KILLAINE
She didnt have to He could have
climbed down from here

her when she registered He knew

BRANDON

(reading aloud)
Dear Inspector Killaine This is
goodbye You were right I had a
secret You were right I changed
my name I tried to hide from the
past and I walked into almost the
same situation that I had run away
from I didnt kill Larry Mitchell
but I cant prove it I couldnt
prove it the other time either
Where I am going nothing has to
be proved Theres a lot of water
between Vancouver and the USA
In that and in you Vancouver
has been kind to me I think you
will understand Betty Mayfield

Brandon stops reading his face is tight and grim
he refolds the note and turns to look at Betty

BRANDON
If you meant it you wouldnt show
it to me Betty
(pause)
Or am I supposed to deliver it to
dear Inspector Killaine

BETTY

(in a half-wild

tone)
Wrote it in the waiting room of
the Hudson Bay Store Wit
somebodys Pekingese trying to
climb into my lap Perhaps youre
right Perhaps I didnt mean it
All I know is that Im licked

BRANDON
(very slowly)
Theres a lot of water between
Vancouver and the USA This note
is a suicide note After youre
gone where would they look for
you

(long pause)

Slowly
Why would they look for you
Darkness and open water anda
fast cabin cruiser And I have a
pocket full of money And if I
helped you Id be committing a
crime or so they tell me

BETTY
That wasnt why I called you Why
did I hope--when I hadnt any right
to hope

BRANDON
How bad is it Bad enough for--
(he taps pointing
to the note)

BETTY
Yes Ive never been very far
from it for a long time Will
you do something for me

Brandon nods
BETTY

Take me where I havent the courage
to take myself

BRANDON
How bad is the other thing The
secret

BETTY

I was tried for murdering my
husband Guilty The judge set
the verdict aside There was one
man on the jury--

(she pauses shakes

her head)
--but he was afraid They were
all afraid--of my father-in-law
That man followed me last night--
he came from him of course My
father-in-law will never give up
Never He promised me that

(she laughs a little)
So I came to Vancouver BC As
far away as I can get from North
Carolina And it happens all over
again Almost the same thing
Almost the same way Do you wonder
about this--

She reaches to take the note from his hand He pulls it
away from her

BRANDON
This is the ace Betty But not
of spades Theyll find out about
the other They might know already
And when they get this--

(he holds up the

note again)
What would they look for Where
Out there somewhere

(he points towards

the open water

beyond the ships)

BETTY
Theyll look for you

BRANDON
I run over to Victoria Play some
golf with some people I know Do
it all the time Thats why I
have a cabin cruiser Custom-
builtForty knots Mr Clark Brandon
an almost gentleman of almost
complete leisure Member of six
golf clubs Broke 70 once on the
Shaughnessy Heights Course You
have to be good to do that And if
you look out of a front window of
the Empress Hotel in Victoria in
a few hours you can look right
down on Mr Brandons boat the
Valkyrie Came alone Sure He
always comes alone Mr Brandons
a rather lonely man

BETTY
(staring at him
fascinated)
And Betty Mayfield--

BRANDON

Blonde beautiful and sad--and
nowhere Of course she might have
run away--if she knew how And
where to go She might have dyed
her hair Bleached it before
probably

(Betty nods)
And changed her name again But
look at this note

(he holds it up)
And look at her room in the hotel
Her stuff is all there Hasnt a
rag except what she stood up in
You dont run away like that Not
if you are young and beautiful
No chance
BETTY
(catching a little
enthusiasm from
him)
But thats what Im doing Couldnt
they think of that

BRANDON

If they had any reason to Why
make it tough for themselves Why
go to all that trouble Heres an
open book Close it No reason
to keep it open She was a nice
girl anyway And perhaps she
didnt kill him on purpose Perhaps
she didnt kill the other one

You never know Give her the
benefit of the doubt Leave her
stay where she is Close the book

He pulls her towards him holds her in his arms and kisses
her

BRANDON

Im not Or I wouldnt be doing

(softly)
Even if I didnt like you Id
have to do it Like the guy that
was dealt thirteen spades ina
bridge hand Or filled an ace-
high flush You couldnt get him

handcuffed with a Man standing beside him Magruder is
scowling Driscoll brings up his left hand showing on a
spread handkerchief the sawed-off belly gun that Magruder

took away from Goble and put in his desk drawer

DRISCOLL
What always throws me about people
like you is that youre so stupid
Dont you know these things have
numbers on them And that they
have to be registered if theyre
owned legally And that if we
find a man dead with his pockets
empty--and identify him and find
out hes a private detective from
San Francisco--

MAGRUDER
(tough)
It needs music

DRISCOLL

(ignoring him and

continuing right

on)
All we have to do is call the San
Francisco Police and get numbers
for his guns For the love of the
Saints Magruder if youre going
into the murder business why dont
you learn a few rules You must
have been pretty desperate to move
him out of here in broad daylight

Magruder reacts This one catches him right square on the
point of the chin

DRISCOLL
(softly)
Dont you know we have people down
in the district working for us
They might look like tramps to
you and some of them are But
they have eyes

MAGDRUDER

(hoarsely)
The guy pulled a gun on me I
thought it was a stick-up I hit
him with a sap Why wouldnt I
Maybe I hit him too hard and it
scared me I wanted to get him
away from here A guy like me
dont always get believed by guys
like you

DRISCOLL
You had over sixteen hundred dollars
in your pocket a thousand of them
in twenty-dollar bills Witha
kind of new look about them at
that Would you be interested in
what I think about this Magruder
Magruder doesnt answer He is beginning to look very
groggy

DRISCOLL
(sharply to the
other dick)
Hold him Hes trying to sag on
us

The other dick straightens Magruder up pushes him against
the wall Magruders eyes are rolling in his head

DRISCOLL

(mercilessly)
This man Goble rented the car
gave a false name He had no
licence no identification But
he put up a sufficient deposit
He was a suspicious man He was
on a dubious errand He had a gun
in his pocket and Im thinking one
of these manila envelopes--

(he points to the

waste basket)
Contained those sheets of blank
paper which he was going to sell
for money And get out before
anybody looked at what hed sold
You had the money Magruder But
you didnt give it to him You
killed him instead

Magruder starts to sag again

DRISCOLL

(more gently)
Perhaps you didnt mean to kill
him But here he was dead and
his car was outside in the street
So you brought it around to the
alley and you carried the man down
to it and you drove him away
And what happened to him after
that nobody knows until he was
picked out of the water of the
Sound dead But not long dead
Where did you leave the car
Magruder Who helped you What
boat did you have

(pauses His voice

changes to a dry

business-like tone

addressing the

other dick)
All right Take him in Set him
down Give him what he wants to
make him comfortable And get a
stenographer And warn him And
dont rough him Hes a nice little
man All he wants is to collect
his thoughts And then hell tell
us the whole story in his own words
(his voice becomes
positively corny)
Wont you Magruder darling

Magruder pitches forward to the floor in a dead faint
The two detectives stand looking at him

DRISCOLL
(somberly)
Hell be giving the priest a bad
time this one Maybe Youd better
call an ambulance He might have
a wonky ticker

Killaine standing looking up at end wall towards the wall
of the penthouse terrace He looks down at the chaise on
which Mitchells body was found He goes to it wheels it
over so it is close to the end wall His eyes measure the
distance from the chaise up to the top of the parapet wall
of the penthouse terrace Gore appears IN THE SHOT ABOVE
He looks down

KILLAINE
(calling up to him)
Im coming up

He goes down to the corner of the balcony wall steps up
on it steadying himself with a hand against the steep end
wall He turns his body so that he is standing sideways
rather unsteadily and reaches up His hands are about
two feet short of being able to reach the top of the wall
at which Gore stands Killaine gathers himself for a jump
springs catches the top of the wall with one hand swings
outwards glances down

WHAT HE SEES

Sheer drop of 100 feet to the stone terrace outside the

He points down Gore looks over the wall downwards
WHAT HE SEES

Portion of Bettys balcony and the chaise almost directly

where it is now And the second
time to move it where we found it

TWO SHOT - KILLAINE AND GORE
On the balcony

KILLAINE
Not too hard is it

GORE
(staring at him)
Maybe weve been pretty dumb--

KILLAINE
(quietly)
There wasnt any motivelets
try out the act

Gore steps back Killaine puts his hand in his pocket and
brings out a gun which looks very like the death gun

KILLAINE

I have a gun Its not loaded
Pretend it is Im drunk I took
the gun away from Margo West Now
Ive said something to you that
you dont like I dont like the
look in your eyes either Ive
pulled the gun Take it away from
me And while youre taking it
away from me it goes off Ready

Gore nods

KILLAINE
Lets go

Gore suddenly swarms him There is a brief sharp struggle
Gore gets his hand over the gun It goes down as they
fight for it Gore turns it in toward Killaines body
There is a sharp click Gore steps back with the gun in
his hand

KILLAINE
Was that about the right angle

GORE
I think so

KILLAINE
Wheres the shell

GORE
Should be over there

Points to the angle of the wall

KILLAINE
Pick it up Put it in your pocket

Gore pretends to do so

KILLAINE
The same with the gun

Gore puts the gun in his pocket

KILLAINE
Youve got a dead man on your hands
You killed jim--even if it wasnt
murder What are you going to do
about it

GORE
If Ive got any sense Im going to
call headquarters

KILLAINE
Theyll probably believe you But
theyll want to know what you were
fighting about Why Mitchell had
a gun Youll tell them a simple
story Theyll pretend it sounds
all right to them Now youre
headquarters How does it sound
to you

GORE
Before I took the story and closed
the case Id want to know a lot
more about these people Id want
to know just about everything about
them

KILLAINE
(nodding)
Exactly Now Im the killer And
theres something I dont want you
to know Something that would
destroy my comfortable life rob
me of my friends my position

GORE
Such as

KILLAINE
Assume there is something to hid
I go to a lot of trouble What do
I do What would you do

GORE
Do I know who lives down there

KILLAINE
You can find out

GORE
Do I know that shes out of the
room Likely to be out of it for
some time

KILLAINE
You can find out the first part
The second part you have to take a
chance on

GORE
Pretty big chance huh

KILLAINE
Youve got a dead man on your hands
Like this

He allows himself to collapse down on the floor against
the wall

GORE
Right--

He bends down over Killaine gets a firemans lift on him--
gets him up drapes him over the wall half on one side

and half on the other his head and shoulders on the inside
He straightens up takes a firm grip on Killaines wrists
and eases him down over the wall Gores head and shoulders
follow until he is lying across the wall on his stomach

ANGLE UP - UPWARD REVERSE SHOT FROM BETTYS BALCONY

Showing Killaines body dangling directly over the chair
Gore comes as far down as he can Killaine has only a few
feet to fall Killaine looks down then up at Gore

KILLAINE
Let go

Gore releases his wrists Killaine sprawls down on the
chaise almost rolls over it saves himself lies down on
his side Gore climbs over the wall lowers himself hangs
by his hands looks down lets go with one hand drops
lands rather heavily on the balcony near the chaise goes
down on his hands and knees He stands up dusts himself
off lifts the chaise with Killaine on it and wheels it
about six feet away to the position where it was found
with Mitchells body Killaine stands up off the chaise

KILLAINE
Next

Gore reaches into his pocket takes out the gun and a match

GORE
(holding the match
up)

This is the shell
(tossing it over in
the corner)

What about the gun

KILLAINE
Well What about it

GORE
Ive handled it Mitchells handed
it If I wipe it off no suicide
If I take it out and lose it no

suicide If I leave it hereno
suicide

KILLAINE
So

GORE

Ive got to find a way to handle
it openly Like Brandon

Killaine nods

GORE
(doubtful again)
How did he know hed get the chance
He couldnt have arranged it

KILLAINE
He could have tried If he was up
there in the dark listening hed
know when she came home know when
she found Mitchell dead know what
she did about it If she
telephoned hed probably hear

t

GORE
And she did give him the chance
the way it worked out

KILLAINE

If she didnt--if luck was against
him--he wipes the gun off reaches
t
c

he wall up there--drops it on the

haise
GORE
No suicide
KILLAINE
Did we ever really think it was
suicide
GORE

You win Inspector You win all
along the line Why didnt we
think of Brandon before--or did we--
some of us

(pause then

answering himself
Yeah Of course you did When a
suspect thinks hes safe you go
on letting him think hes safe
Wait for a mistake

KILLAINE
And a motive--which we havent
got So this could all be a dream

Gore nods silently Killaine reaches in his pocket takes
out Mitchells thin gold case opens it looks down

KILLAINE
Market one-eight-four-two

He looks up at Gore

GORE

searching the sky without changing expression Betty comes
back up the companionway sits down in a corner of the
seat

BETTY
I decided I didnt want a
drinkIm beginning to wonder
BRANDON
Wonder what
BETTY
If youre doing all this just for
me
BRANDON

That and the fun of it

BETTY
I thought you had to be back to

BRANDON

Thats right

Silently Betty takes out the note and holds it towards
him Brandon glances at it He cocks his ear towards the
PLANE NOISE

BRANDON
See anything up there

As betty looks up he lets go of the wheel and makes a
sudden grab for the wrist of the hand holding the note
There is a short sharp struggle Brandon has the note

The wheel swings wildly and the cabin cruiser keels over
into a hard turn Brandon thrusts the note into his pocket
grabs the wheel wrenches it around gets the cruiser going
on course again Betty leans in a corner of a seat away
from him

BETTY
Funny I never thought of you that
way You were so close too We
were all pretty stupid about you

BRANDON
(tightly)
Including Killaine

BETTY
(softly)
Including KillaineI still cant
think of you that way

BRANDON
(staring straight
ahead)
I told you my father died in jail
He stole a fortune Most of it
pretty dirty money I dont care
to have that known

BETTY
(same tone)
Larry Mitchell found out So you
killed him

BRANDON
In a way

BETTY
If it was an accident you could
have told the truth

BRANDON
So could you But our records
were a little against us

BETTY
What your father did doesnt condemn
you

BRANDON

Nobody believed I wasnt in on it
I was just a dumb-smart collage
boy and he was my father I
thought it was a legitimate
business He was a politician
with fingers in a lot of pies I
never saw the pies They had names
For the record Innocent names

(he shrugs)
You know where that kind of money
comes from dont you

BETTY
The money that makes you Mr Clark
Brandon Lets you live ina
penthouse on top of the Vancouver
Royal Lets you own a cruiser
Lets you do as you please go where
you please You big open-handed
generous guy Thats the kind of
money it takes isnt it

The PLANE NOISE is a little LOUDER Brandon looks up at
it without much interest then looks at Betty

BRANDON
It buys things just like any other
kind

BETTY

That man that was following us
last night--he didnt come back
this morning Im beginning to
wonder about him too Was he
really following me--or you

BRANDON
No I paid him off

BETTY
Hell come backThey always come
back when you give them money

BRANDON
Not this one And not Mitchell

BETTY
(recoiling)
You-killed-him

BRANDON

(with a twisted

smile)
Magruder obliged me No use my
saying it wasnt planned that way
I had to clean up Im not a dumb-
smart college boy anymore

(he takes a deep

breath)
Nobody in the world would believe
I didnt plan the whole thing
BETTY
I guess Im a little screwy Maybe
I could believe it Should I try

BRANDON
Dont go soft on me baby Ive
got your note in my pocket You
wrote it all by your own self
And I have to use it It has to
be found in exactly the right place

BETTY
So that I will never be found

(thickly)
Im not a murderer yet you said
Come here Come closer Let me
look at you

Betty holds off then slowly comes towards him along the
seat until their faces close He searches her eyes

BRANDON
(quietly)
I think you mean that

BETTY
Do you think I was faking

BRANDON
(thickly)
If I did-I dont-now

He puts his arms around her pulls her close There is
kind of wonder in his eyes Hers stare back at him calm
and level He kisses her hard on the mouth lets her go
She pulls away from him along the seat She doesnt know
what to think of him She is terrified resigned and at
the same time he still has an attraction for her

BRANDON
The kiss of death
(laughs)
With a new twist

He lifts the gun in his hand looks at it tosses it
overboard He reaches inside his coat takes out the
suicide note

BRANDON
(reading)
Dear Inspector Killaine This is
goodbye You were right I hada
secret

The DIESEL ENGINE SOUND has grown louder Brandon looks
up from the note

BRANDON
A secret Betty---as who hasnt

He crumples the note and envelope in his hand drops them
over the side of the boat Opens the engine full throttle
and the power of the cruiser almost tears it out from under
them Betty is thrown violently against the seat He
reaches out and straightens her up There is a mad light
in his eyes His face is no longer hard

Stand up Let them take a good
look at you Be sure they see

you can

Betty does what he tells her She waves There is an
answering wave from the bridge of the Lynx We cant see

HORN SOUND is louder but seems to come from all directions
Brandon is leaning forward tensely trying to see ahead

He turns the wheel first one way and then another There
is a sudden blast of the FOGHORN very LOUD

Brandon turns the wheel violently and the cruiser keels
over But he is now quick enough Suddenly above looms
the enormous bow of the Puget Sound Ferry as big as an
ocean liner It is ablaze with light CAMERA PANS UP to
show it crashing down into the lens as it were

THE CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE

Thrown out of the water almost it is up-ended on its stern
The ferry tears on through filling the screen

A couple of PASSENGERS in overcoats leaning against the
rail looking out into the fog One of them is lighting a
cigarette cupping his hands around the lighter

up here

SECOND PASSENGER

a lot of fog But they never hit
anything somehow

At the end of the bridge an OFFICER is leaning down staring
towards the water He shakes his head straightens up
turns away
OFFICER
(speaking off)
An old packing case I guess
A BIG SEARCHLIGHT
Its beam is turned down on the water The beam moves a
little back towards the stern CAMERA FOLLOWS THE BEAM

DOWN THROUGH THE FOG Empty water only is SEEN The
searchlight is switched off

WIPE TO
DARK FOGGY SHOT CLOSE TO SURFACE OF WATER
A broken piece of the cabin cruisers bow floats by closer
and closer to THE CAMERA until on it the name VALKYRIE
stands out then it whirls past There is nothing left
but the foggy surface of the Sound

FADE OUT
