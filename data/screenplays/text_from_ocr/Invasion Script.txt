SPACE 1

Cold lonely fear-inducing awe-inspiring Space The frame
is filled with vibrant clusters of shimmering stars
Beyond them - in deep space - purple and turquoise nebula

Five asteroids enter the bottom of the frame and slowly
travel upwards though slow is a relative term out here

We move ‘up’ with the asteroids Keeping pace A 50000mph
galactic tracking shot

The earth slowly enters frame We’re on the dark side of the
planet so ‘nightglow’ is visible a lustrous green haze in
the upper part of the atmosphere

The earth fills the screen and we see patchworks of city lights
Dense labyrinthine constellations

The asteroids flame-up as they burn through the atmosphere

EARTH 2
WIDE - a purple dawn A few stars are visible at the top of
the frame Silhouettes of trees and houses skirt the bottom
A few lights are on early risers

An asteroid - now a raging fireball - tears across the sky
The afterglow is a spectrum of hypnotic colors

It explodes into a dozens of meteorites No sound is emitted
Not yet The fragments splinter off in separate directions

A delayed BANG echoes out no louder than a distant firework
Birds SCATTER A car alarm BLARES A few dogs BARK

The meteors vaporize Within seconds there’s no trace left
At least none we can see

The car alarm is switched off
The dogs stop barking

And it’s like it never happened

FOREST 3
Meteor dust sprinkles over an expanse of woodland
They glimmer in the bright shafts of morning light

The particles land on leaves ferns flowers and forest detritus
Interim White Draft 2

OMITTED 4

LAND 5

A hot damp gloomy forest floor Small insects chew on
nectar pollen leaves and unsuspectingly - the meteor dust

MACRO CLOSE on the particles - not ‘dust’ but tiny parasites
Wrinkly microorganisms with stubby feet

Larger predators descend locusts mantes beetles and arachnids
They rip the small insects apart with their mandibles We hear
each BITE TEAR and CRUNCH An orgy of violence

But we’re also enthralled by the beauty of these strange beasts

The glue of nature

And now - oblivious hosts

SKIN 6

WE PAN across human skin Hard to tell what part of the body
It’s hairless and has soft undulating ridges of veins

WE LAND on a mosquito An ugly hairy creature with dazzling
polychrome eyes It’s proboscis pierces the skin

VEIN 7

A crimson tunnel It gently throbs as blood rushes through it
The parasite flows downstream It claws onto a fibrous wall

and burrows through

BRAIN 8

A dark cavernous landscape made of towering canyons immense
arches and twisting stalactites This is a submicroscopic world
of the human brain but seems like a surreal alien landscape
The parasite penetrates the membranous tissue It convulses and

hundreds of long sinuous worms burst from its body WE TRACK
towards the writhing worms until they fill the frame
Interim White Draft 3

INT MOTEL - DAY 9
Somewhere in Northern California

In a cheap dark musty motel a watch BEEPS MALIK KHAN South Asian American bolts upright and turns his alarm off
Hardwired instincts

He hears something - a low pulsating hum He turns sees an
air vent in the corner of the room He stares at the vent
trying to discern if it’s the source of the sound

SLOW ZOOM in on the circular air vent
CUT TO

MACRO CLOSE on Maliks eye The iris fills the frame The eye
moves up down left right The TV plays in the background

NEWSCASTER (0S)
Rioters are storming parts of the
city looting stores and setting
buildings on fire

WIDER Malik inspects his eye in the bathroom mirror We get a
better look at him Chiseled but craggy for his years lived a
whole life already He’s ripped - a man of discipline and he
has the deep watchful eyes of a man being hunted

NEWSCASTER (0S)
The mayor has issued a statement
saying that “thugs are trying to
tear down the city and incite
violence”

Malik picks up a can of insect repellent and SPRAYS his face
arms and body covering every inch of exposed skin

We glimpse Maliks tattoos on his forearm - a flaming skull
with stars speckled around it On his other arm - a child’s
stick figure drawing The primitive crayon lines rendered in
colorful detail A warrior A father

Malik enters the bedroom and watches the news report - a riot
rages in an American city Civilians throw rocks at police
tear gas is fired into crowds A bus is on fire Total chaos

But from Maliks steady gaze it’s nothing he hasn’t seen before
This is the world now

NEWSCASTER
The National Guard fired into the
crowd taking three lives It’s not
yet clear whether this was an act --
Interim White Draft 4

Malik turns the TV off hearing something - that PULSATING HUM
It’s louder now distinctly organic made of dense OSCILLATING
PATTERNS and DISTURBING FREQUENCIES

He scans the room trying to locate the source

He approaches the bedside places his ear against the wall

and hears a RAGING BOMBILATION A swarm has built a nest
inside the wall cavity

Maliks eyes roam the wall and sees -- a Red Wasp crawl out
of a crack above his bed

Malik takes the Bible from the bedside table and SLAMS the wasp
CUT TO

FULL FRAME - a map of America pinned to a wall Half the
states are colored with highlighter Malik peels it off

Malik urgently packs items into a military duffel bag the
folded map a Glock pistol combat knife field rations
penlight flashlight socks compass a file

Another Red Wasp crawls out from the crack followed by
another and another

Malik pulls out a can of insecticide and SPRAYS them - TSSS

INT OREGON FARM HOUSE JAYS BEDROOM - DAY 10
Somewhere in Southern Oregon

We’re CLOSE on a drawing - an astronaut fires a ray gun at an
insectoid Impressively detailed for the young hands at work

CLOSE ON JAY KHAN He makes SHOOTING NOISES as he draws
totally immersed within his imaginative world

On his desk we see a framed photo of a clean-shaven Malik in
his Marine dress blues

We take in the room Creaky Dated decor Peeling wallpaper
Jays drawings adorn the walls rockets astronauts a boy
being beamed up by a spaceship Dreams of escape

Jays mother PIYA (30s) opens the door and quietly studies
her son She radiates a kindness

PIYA
Jay you can’t stay in all day

Jay glances at the cattle farm outside his window
10A

Interim White Draft 5
JAY
It stinks out there

PIYA
You’1l get used to the smell

No response Friction between them

PIYA
Dylan’s taking Bobby out on the
tractor

JAY

Dylan stinks
Piya THWAKS her neck

PIYA
Ow Getting eaten alive today

She looks at her hand a crushed Horsefly
She brushes the remnants away enters and hugs Jay from behind
She studies his drawing marveled by his raw talent

PIYA
This is incredible baby

Jay shuffles himself away from her hug Piya stands rethinks

PIYA
Want me to send it to your dad

Jay nods

PIYA
Okay But you gotta do me a favor

Jay looks up at the farm beyond his window

EXT MOTEL CAR PARK - DAY 10A

Malik enters his Jeep Cherokee and places his duffel bag on
the passenger seat

He starts the ignition turns to look out and sees a CHILD in the adjacent car staring at him

Malik smiles and waves at the kid Gets nothing in return

Malik presses his mouth to the window and blows - his cheeks
expand and he crosses his eyes
Interim White Draft 6
The kid laps it up Does the same - pressing his face against
the glass and blowing
The child’s MOTHER (30s) arrives at the scene

MOTHER
What are you doing to my child

Malik puts his palms up

MALIK
Just being a dumbass

MOTHER
You leave us alone

Malik studies the woman something seems off He sticks his
car in reverse and pulls away
EXT OREGON FARM - DAY 11

WIDE - a flat endless landscape of ploughed earth Wind blows
dust across the field A tractor trundles into frame

INSIDE THE TRACTOR

Jay discreetly draws a spaceship on the window with a marker
pen It’s angled in such a way that it flies away from the farm

Next to Jay sits his brother BOBBY KHAN a cherubic-faced
rough-and-tumble ball of energy He has a huge grin clearly
taken by their new life on the farm

Their step-father DYLAN (40s) drives He picks Bobby up
places him on his lap and lets Bobby steer

Jay studies Dylan Doesn’t trust something about him

He returns to his spaceship and adds exhaust plume to the engine
The ROAR OF A SPEEDING ENGINE RISES

IE MALIKS JEEP CHEROKEE CALIFORNIA A-ROAD - DAY 12

Malik tries tuning the radio as he drives He struggles to
find a station - just HIGH-PITCHED STATIC

He sees a road rage brawl ahead -- A BUSINESS MAN and a
HOCKEY FAN tear at each other Cars swerve around them

Malik slows as he passes It’s a brutal fist fight Blood
smeared across both their faces Their vehicles are totalled
Interim White Draft 7

INT OREGON FARMHOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING 13

Piya Dylan Jay and Bobby eat dinner An awkward atmosphere
This isn’t a family yet

Jay draws as he eats He glances at Dylan then adds a mustache
to the insectoid

DYLAN
(To Piya)
You know Bobby practically drove
the tractor all by himself Ain’t
that right

BOBBY
Uh-huh Jay was too scaredy-cat --

Jay punches Bobby on the arm

JAY
No I wasn’t dumbass
BOBBY
Mom
PIYA

Jay what is the matter with--

Piya drops her fork and winces She stands exits and walks
down the hall We hear the muffled sound of Piya VOMITING

The boys share a concerned glance

JAY
(to Dylan)
Is Mom alright

DYLAN
Just a bug Don’t worry about it
(moving on)
So how about I take you both
fishing after school tomorrow My
Daddy says you ain’t truly fished
till you fished the Chewaucan

Bobby gestures to his toy frog laying on the table

BOBBY
Can Franklin come too

Dylan leans over to Bobby and conspiratorially whispers

Interim White Draft 8

DYLAN
Well that depends does Franklin
like fishing
Bobby thinks a beat then nods

DYLAN
Then hell yeah Franklin can come

Dylan winks at him Bobby tries to wink but ends up blinking
Jay studies Dylan SCRATCH a swollen insect bites on his wrist
Dylan senses Jays gaze
DYLAN
Wowzers that is an awesome picture
Jay Maybe we can frame it

Jay looks Dylan dead in the eye and slowly SCRUNCHES it up

DYLAN
That’s it go to bed young man

Jay stands exits and SLAMS the door

INT OREGON FARMHOUSE JAY AND BOBBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING 14

A cosmic night light throws up a scene of colorful nebula
Jay lays in bed reading from a shoebox of letters

CLOSE on the letter - we glimpse phrases “secret mission”
“have to keep fighting” “see you real soon” “Love Dad”

Jays eyes mist up Hasn’t seen Malik in a long time

Jay digs in the box and takes out a frayed 80s sci-fi comic
“Space Solider’ The source of his inspiration

Jay reads the comic Pure wonder in his eyes

CLOSE-UPS of the comic - the Space Soldier boards a rocket
and pilots across the galaxy past colossal planets through
meteor showers and prismatic wormholes

IE MALIKS JEEP OREGON HIGHWAY - NIGHT 15

ANGLE CAR HOOD we enter an orange tunnel and weave through
traffic going twice the speed of other vehicles

Malik glances in the rear-view to see if anyone is following
His eyes are always vigilant Always watching

Interim White Draft 9

EXT OREGON FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 16
WIDE - vivid stars in the country night sky The house below
vulnerable and isolated The surrounding farmland is alive
with twinkling fireflies mirroring the stars above

WE TRACK TOWARDS a bug zapper on the porch annihilating an
army of insects Its purple light FLASHES with each kill

INT OREGON FARMHOUSE JAY AND BOBBYS ROOM - NIGHT 17

CLOSE UPS on Jay and Bobby Their eyelids gently twitch
existing in another dream dimension

Jays hand dangles off his bed Beside his fingertips is the
letter Maliks hand comes into frame and picks it up

CLOSE ON MALIK the nebula nightlight slowly spins across the
contours of his face He scans the letter then takes in the
sight of his sleeping boys Savors the moment
He crouches down next to Jay and gently strokes his head
MALIK
(whispered)

Wakey-wakey Jay

Jays eyes blink open

Jay rises and hugs Malik squeezes tight as he can

MALIK

emotion hits him He pulls away and checks Bobby’s eyes with
the penlight

Outside a MAN covered head-to-toe in PPE cleans the forecourt
with a pressure washer hose

MALIK
You could or you could stay right

and hands them to the boys

Interim White Draft 16
The boys open their presents Bobby has an Action Man
Jay has fancy drawing pens

JAY BOBBY
Cool Whoa

Bobby plays with his action man Jay opens his pens but then
realizes he doesn’t have his sketchbook

He HUFFS and slumps in his seat But then he spies something--

Maliks file sticking out the duffel bag He leans forward
grabs it and flicks through the pages

CLOSE on the pages - a scientific paper on ‘mind-control
parasites’ It features electron microscope images of
parasitic organisms Ghastly Lovecraftian creatures rendered
in exquisite detail

CLOSE ON JAY mesmerized by their terrifying strangeness
DDDRRRVVVV - the pressure hose sprays against the window

JAY BOBBY
AH Aggghhh

Jay and Bobby turn to see the cleaner staring at them through
the smeared glass Hard to discern if he’s benign or
sinister

INT GAS STATION CONVENIENCE STORE - SAME 24
A MELANCHOLIC COUNTRY TUNE plays from a stereo

Malik stares up at a Dung Beetle fly around a fluorescent light

The CASHIER (40s) a heavyset woman watches Malik with a
dead-eyed stare

approaches the counter

He lays down his items red bull energy bars and a map
‘California and Nevada’ The cashier begins to scan the items

large pine trees

imaginative world

MALIK
Jay come up here

Jay crawls to the front seat and buckles in

He looks up at Malik His hero Sees a four-inch scar under
his eye The skull tattoo on his forearm

MALIK
So you kept my letters

JAY

Interim White Draft 18

MALIK
I kept all your drawings too Some

JAY
Dad why do you have pictures of
monsters

MALIK
Monsters

In your file

MALIK
You’re not supposed to go through
my stuff

JAY
That wasn’t a rule

MALIK
It is now rule number three
And they’re not monsters They’re
parasites

JAY
What’s a parasite

MALIK
It’s a tiny organism that lives
inside another creature

JAY
Inside humans

MALIK
Why don’t you get some sleep and we
can talk about it in the morning

JAY
I gotta pee

MALIK
How bad

Interim White Draft 20

MALIK

Malik breathes a sigh of relief

MALIK
Oh No one was on the road so

Beat as the trooper squints and sees the boys inside the Jeep

TROOPER
You say you’re on a road trip

TROOPER

MALIK

The early bird

The Trooper studies Malik for a long beat
TROOPER

Put your hands on the trunk and

spread your legs

MALIK
Shit there ain’t no need for--

The Trooper unclips the safety strap on his gun holster
TROOPER
I got an ‘easy-way hard-way’ speech
prepared if you want to hear it

Malik turns and places his hands on the back window

The Trooper comes up behind Malik and gives him a pat-down
starting at the ankles
Interim White Draft 21

Jay and Bobby nervously watch from inside the jeep Malik
sees the fear in their eyes

He winks at them and gestures at them to put their head down
Jay and Bobby lower themselves out of view

The Trooper finds Maliks Glock tucked in the back of his jeans

TROOPER
You got a permit for this

MALIK
Not on me That against the law

TROOPER
It’s a class A misdemeanor if the
firearm is loaded

The Trooper opens the magazine - it’s full
Malik mumbles a ‘fuck’ under his breath

TROOPER
Do you have any other concealed
weapons on you

MALIK
No sir

The Trooper tucks the gun into his belt then taps Malik on
the shoulder Malik turns

MALIK
Look I’m a Marine just came back
from tour

Malik slowly takes out his Marine ID from his wallet and
hands it to the Trooper

The Trooper studies it on both sides runs his fingernail
across the photo

MALIK
I’m taking my boys on a camping
trip in Tahoe I only have them for
the weekend so I drive at night to
make the most of it

Beat on the Trooper studying the ID Then studying Malik
Then studying the ID

MALIK
Youre arresting me for a
misdemeanor

TROOPER

Malik sees a parasitic worm slither across the white of the
Trooper’s eye Malik prickles with fear

He turns and walks to his drivers door frantically calculating
his next move think think think

TROOPER
Woah woah where you going

MALIK
Let me just get my driver’s license
officer You can write me a ticket
and well be on our way
The Trooper whips out his tazer and aims it at Malik’s back

TROOPER
Stop right there

Malik freezes

TROOPER
Place your hands behind your head

Malik turns to face the Trooper puts his palms out

MALIK
Okay chill let’s just--

The Trooper fires his tazer the probes dart into Maliks chest
He collapses to his knees and his muscles lock up as 50000 volts
surge through his body

MALIK
AGGHHHHH--—

The 5-second-shock ends Malik rips the wires away rises--
The Trooper pulls out his service weapon--
Malik charges forward and grabs onto the Trooper’s gun--

The Trooper FIRES - the bullet tears through the peak of Malik’s
truckers cap sending it spinning into the air

They wrestle for control of the weapon - it’s a messy
contorted life-or-death grapple

Interim White Draft 23
Hard to see who’s winning in the darkness we just hear
GRUNTING and the SCUFFLE of boots on tarmac

Malik’s Glock falls from the troopers belt and CLATTERS to
the ground Neither can risk reaching for it

BANG - a shot is fired into the sky BANG - another shot is
fired at the ground and kicks off the road

The gun is twisted toward the JEEP -- at the boys BANG

The bullet PIERCES the window spider web cracks splinter
across the glass Bobby SCREAMS is he hit

Malik CRIES OUT galvanizing every fiber of strength -- he
tears the gun away and PISTOL WHIPS the Trooper - hammering
the handle into the Trooper’s face CRACK CRACK CRACK--

The Trooper stumbles backward and COLLAPSES on the ground
Malik darts towards the Jeep the splintered window

MALIK

Malik swings the door open - sees them cowering inside

JAY

Malik leans on his knees Breathes once again
QUICK SHOTS

- He reaches his hand inside the Trooper’s vehicle and rips
out the receiver

- He enters his Jeep and screeches away WE TRACK SIDEWAYS
revealing the immobile Trooper laying by the side of the road

Jay and Bobby mimic their father After a few calming breaths

MALIK
Okay look This is isn’t a road

The boys glance at each other

MALIK
You know I’ve been away fighting
What I couldn’t tell you was what
I’ve been fighting Boys I’ve been
in a war that no one knows is going
on fighting an enemy we weren’t
even sure existed Something’s come
to our planet

Stunned expressions on the boys as they compute
Interim White Draft 25

JAY
Aliens

MALIK
Non-terrestrial microorganisms

BOBBY
I havent seen any aliens

MALIK
You have you just don’t know it
They live inside us and use us as
hosts Folks look like they’re
normal but they’re not they’ve got
a tiny creature inside them

BOBBY
There’s an alien inside of me

MALIK
No not unless you’re infected
It’s spread through insects that’s
why we use the spray Think of it
like a force field

JAY
What happens if you’re infected

MALIK
The parasite alters the neurochemisty--
(remembers his audience)
Okay you know that voice inside your
head that tells you right from wrong
That’s called your conscience The
creature stops that from working

BOBBY
So you become a baddie

MALIK
Exactly Even if you’re a goodie

JAY
How many people have been infected

MALIK
A lot We don’t know exactly Could
be as many as half the population

BOBBY
We gotta go back and save Mom

Sombre beat Malik doesn’t say anything Jay connects the dots
Interim White Draft 26

JAY
Mom’s an alien

MALIK
She’s got one inside her She’s
still alive just not in control

Bobby and Jay start to silently cry This kills Malik

MALIK
I’m gonna save her boys Trust me

WE LAND ON A CLOSE-UP and hear GURGLES heit’s alive

The Alien-Trooper rises revealing the mangled wreckage of a
face - collapsed eye socket dislocated jaw broken nose
Dried blood streaks from every wound

However he doesn’t seem in pain In fact he remains eerily
calm as he spits out tooth debris

action shotgun from the car holster and exits

He strides across the parking lot and approaches Maliks Jeep

He peers inside and sees Jay and Bobby fast asleep in the
backseat Jays head is pressed against the window

single tear perhaps the man inside trying to fight back

The Trooper PUMPS his shotgun presses it against the car
window -- at Jay -- and FIRES--

Jay looks at the file

CLOSE on the document listing parasites “Neurocysticercosis”
“Plasmodium falciparum” “Toxoplasma gondii” Jay points at one

JAY
What’s this one do

MALIK
Diplostomum pseudospathaceum It
burrows inside a fish’s eye and
manipulates its behavior so it gets
itself eaten by a bird Then it
reproduces inside the birds guts

JAY
Are the aliens reproducing inside
Mom’s guts

MALIK
God no No no no And even if
they did your mother’s got guts to
spare She’s gonna be fine

Malik shuts the file and steps down from the hood He takes
out the map from his back pocket and lays it out and points
to a location in Nevada

MALIK
So our mission is to get here
Groom Lake

He then runs his finger into California’s central valley

MALIK
And this is where we’re at

Jay points further up the map at southern Oregon

JAY
And this is where we came from

Jay studies an OLD MAN (80s) at the adjacent table He has a
nasal cannula hooked to a canister on the ground His skin is
almost translucent we see the network of veins on his arms

MALIK

picture for me

Malik TAPS a napkin Jay takes out a pen and starts drawing

Shit we lived only ten klicks up

Zilch from the boys Malik SIGHS Notices Bobby’s not eating

MALIK
You’re not hungry Bobby

BOBBY
My tummy hurts

MALIK
That’s because you’re anxious
You’ve got an overflow of cortisol
in your bloodstream which is
stimulating your stomach acid

Malik is met with a WTF expression
Interim White Draft 31

MALIK
It’s a perfectly natural reaction
to a stressful situation But you
still gotta eat

Malik picks up the maple syrup and oozes it onto Bobby’s plate
Bobby and Jay exchange a glance

MALIK
What you don’t like maple syrup

BOBBY
I’m not allowed

JAY
Dylan says sugar makes him hyper

MALIK
Well hell yeah it does that’s the
damn point - gives you a buzz

Malik oozes more onto the plate Bobby’s eyes widen

They tuck in and their unease melts away Malik savors the
moment - almost a regular family meal

MALIK
So Dylan a pain in the ass like
that - ‘don’t eat that sugar’
BOBBY

He cooks macaroni and cheese and he
helps with homework and he lets me
drive his tractor

JAY

MALIK
Skee-ball huh My 4th grade science
teacher liked skee-ball Turned out

there’s a correlation but it’s
worth thinking on

Malik half-regrets the comment

Interim White Draft 32

He’d been out for nearly a month so
we only met four times He was very
polite called me ‘Ma’am’ not
everyone does that He seemed like

arranged the psych-test was because
he said he wasn’t sleeping

seemed like a good guy’

each of ‘em in the eye and see if I
can find the good in them That’s

But you don’t buy it

Hattie shakes her head though the thought terrifies her

SHEPARD
He sure ticks a lot of the boxes
Separated from his wife Isolated
from his children Dishonorably
discharged from the one thing he
did well No benefits no
healthcare no pension A complete
and total loss of status A few
years inside for all that to
ferment - the resentment the rage
Add PTSD into the mix and you got
yourself a ticking time bomb

He gives her a look like the conclusion is obvious
Interim White Draft 50

SHEPARD
He packed no clothes for the boys
No toys Not even a toothbrush You
know he had a gun on him What’s a
convicted felon doing buying a
pistol

Hattie doesn’t want to go there

But he loves his boys

SHEPARD
Practically all annihilators are
considered loving fathers That’s
why no one sees it coming
Hattie feels sick to her stomach

If we don’t stop him Malik Khan is
going to execute his children then
kill himself because thats the
ultimate revenge on his ex-wife

triggered him You guys were close
right

RAUL
Yeah Very Been through hell and
back together He was a good guy
that was handed a raw deal

HATTIE
What kind of Marine was he

RAUL
Malik was a fucking badass Excuse
my French But he also knew how to
turn it on and off

HATTIE
What about the assault

RAUL
That was out of character But you
got to take into account what we
were going through We’d been in
three different firefights that
day seen two of our buddies get
ripped up it’s 120 degrees we’re
gettin’ eaten alive by bugs The
stress was just unimaginable

RAUL (CONTD)

We found some children in the
wreckage Our dip shit Captain made
an offhand comment and Malik
exploded Something snapped

Then his fucking world came
tumbling down

Did he ever mention Piya or the
divorce was he resentful

RaGl remembers the trauma simmers just below the surface

Resentful No He was the one who
asked for it Told her to get on
with her life

RAUL
So we kept in touch but a year ago

CLOSE on the letters we glimpse sentences “The world has
changed” “Our humanity is eroding” How do they infect us
“Have to save my boys”

Pretty out there stuff Obviously I
thought he was having some kind of
breakdown so I wrote back telling
him to get help Never got a reply

Hattie flicks through them some have haunting sketches -
a man covered in bees another shows worms bursting from a
skull another is just page of eyes full of byzantine detail

A flag SNAPS in the wind Malik shines his flashlight up at it -
an American flag with the Roman numeral ‘III’ surrounded by a

And that’s a helluva mistake when

The tension in the air thickens

GRANT
Then again can’t say I hold much
esteem for the federal government
So why don’t you put your gun away
and we can talk like men Maybe
there’s a way we both come out of
this on top

A tense beat Then Malik tucks the gun in the back of his jeans
Grant stands and steps forward into the light - his skin is
ravaged with clusters of tiny holes like a beehive inside
each cavity yellow larvae writhe to the surface He lets out

He GRUNTS Wounded He looks down - his shirt is speckled
crimson He rips it open and sees blood drooling from a hole
beneath his ribs

Grant LOADS two more buckshots and PACES towards the sofa--

Malik scans the floor for his Glock - sees it several feet aways
He goes to reach it but sees Grants shadow approaching

A split second decision - he reaches for a wooden floor lamp
grabs it with both hands rises

And swings - the base SMASHES into Grants face Grant drops
to the floor like a marionette that’s had it’s strings cut

Malik stumbles over to Grant and sees

He’s perfectly human Blood oozes out from a thick gash on
his forehead

Tears roll down Jays cheeks

JAY
Yeah but it was one hell of story

Malik looks at Jay who smiles through his tears
JAY
And it was the demons that made you
do those things And maybe we can
get them out
Malik is floored by his son’s radical empathy

A tender moment opens up Jay slowly puts his hand onto
Maliks and gently takes the gun away

Jay breathes out like he’s just defused a bomb
Malik closes his eyes His muscles relax

Jay sees movement in the wing mirror -- a Sniper with his
rifle up He exits and sprints to the back of the Ram
Interim White Draft 102
JAY (0S)
Get back
XCU - Maliks eyes They open
He looks in the rear-view -- sees Jay facing the sniper
Hardwired instincts Save my son

Malik unbuckles himself opens the door and leaps outside --

122 EXT SALT FLAT - NIGHT 122
And waves his arms in the air drawing everyone’s attention

MALIK
HEY OVER HERE

The helicopter switches its spotlight on illuminating Malik in
a shaft of light like the tractor beam of a spaceship

The sniper trains his gun on Malik the laser floats on his torso

MALIK
Jay put the gun down

Jay keeps his gun trained on the sniper who keeps his gun
trained on Malik A bullet could fire at any moment

JAY
They’re going to shoot you

Malik looks at the sniper who looks back an understanding
The sniper drops his aim

MALIK
No they’re not Jay I’m giving up

MALIKS POV - Jay turns his face pulsates with hundreds of
tiny turquoise lights like a legion of glow worms were
trapped beneath the skin

Malik is fearless against the hallucination

Jay puts the gun on the ground and sprints towards his father

Malik falls to his knees keeps his arms open wide

Jay enters the circle of light and embraces Malik Hugs him
as tight as a child can hug their parent
Interim White Draft 103

The helicopter DOWNDRAFT sends dust swirling around them An
electrifying moment of love between father and son A bond
that can never be broken

CLOSE ON JAY he looks up at the bright light shining down
Ready to be beamed up

CLOSE ON MALIK bathed in light he closes his eyes and for
the first time in years the buzzing stops
