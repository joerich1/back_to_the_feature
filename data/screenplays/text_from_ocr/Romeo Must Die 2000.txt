BLACK SCREEN A VACUUM OF SILENCE

Then THE SOUND OF A RAGING SEA rolls from left to right
across the screen The sweep of it BUILDS IN A
THREATENING RUSH QUICKLY STARTING TO CRESCENDO as WE
SMASH CUT TO --

EXT UNDERWATER - (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO) - DUSK

rey

Where THE CAMERA FINDS two pairs of feet kicking fiercely
from below

EXT OCEAN - (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO) - DUSK 2

Where TWO YOUNG CHINESE BROTHERS (PO AND HAN) fight for
their lives atop a jagged skyline of breaking whitecaps
CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL

The sea has never seemed more violent dancing and
choking them from swell to swell The makeshift raft
keeping them afloat nothing but a tattered basketball

Yet they doggedly cling together a shared dream and
their love for each other conspiring to keep them alive

Welcome to the eight-hour escape from Mainland China to
the promise of a new life in Hong Kong

TIGHTER

As Younger Brother (HAN) starts slipping away losing his
tender grasp on the raft and survival Older brother
(PO) sees this and makes a desperate lunge to help

For a sickening moment Han is swallowed whole by the dark
water Then Po ABRUPTLY HOISTS HIM BACK UP As Older
Brother hugs him protectively to the meat of the raft

YOUNG HAN
(CHINESE)
Where are the great lights

YOUNG PO
(CHINESE)
Not far Hong Kong will shine
bright as day even at night

A HELICOPTER SHOT drags us away from them PULLING
BACK TO REVEAL the hours of naked sea truly ahead and
then WE MATCH CUT TO --

EXT SAN FRANCISCO BAY - OAKLAND SIDE - DUSK 3
Where THE SAME HELICOPTER SHOT sweeps in hard and low

over the water now a lifetime away from our opening
vision

A BRIDGE looms across the water ahead then ADARK SUV
atop the bridge AS WE COME IN TIGHT WE SEE

FOUR ASIAN BAD-ASSES

Riding inside The sheer mass of each mans muscle

threatening to shred the fabric of his Hugo Boss suit

The CREDITS CONCLUDE

EXT STREETS - OAKLAND - DUSK 4

Where WE FOLLOW the same SUV making its way through the
descending darkness

INT DARK SUV - NIGHT 5
Where THE HYPNOTIC BEAT OF EASTERN-FLAVORED TRIP-HOP

courses through the cabin WE WATCH the same four men as
they start feeding their machines

HANDGUNS -- Are withdrawn Were looking at the Fortun
500 of firearms -- SandW 40s Sig-Sauer -380s evena
pair of MP-5s for safe measure
FRESH CLIPS -- Are THUMBED for empties and JAMMED into
the grips
LE R -- Are RACKED into waiting chambers

ING P -- Are fitted for protection in case shit

turns loud The cherry on top Just because you may
have to put someone down doesnt mean you have to go deaf
doing it

EXT WATERFRONT CASINO OAKLAND - NIGHT 6

A thriving gambling and dancing joint set amongst the

Oakland docks Think of it as a little taste of Vegas
nestled inside the jaws of Hip-Hop The Cops are paid
not to ask and the Brothers happy not to tell

The SUV KNIFES into the loading zone quickly joined by a
Porsche Then STEADICAM FOLLOWS as HEAVY BLACK SHOES
exit and make an even march for the club

INT WATERFRONT CASINO - PLUSH BOOTH - NIGHT 7
Where PO SUNG (MID 30S) drains off his third vodka
rocks Looks very much the Asian-American playboy --

hair fucked up Zegna suit and tie tea shades
complementing a bone-handled cane

(CONTINUFD)
7

TWO ASIAN HOTTIES

DANCE SEDUCTIVELY before him This is serious business
for his female companions -- working themselves into a
startlingly salacious coupling

Po smiles lazily as the girls tongues touch in a brief

flicker Rotates the bone handle of his cane back to

reveal a small coke stash Casually dips a nail and does
a bump

WIDER SHOT
As WE REALIZE they re the only Asians in the place

ROOMFUL OF BLACK GAMBLERS AND OTHER DANCERS dagger chem
with stares as THE SECURITY STAFF approaches

The lead Bad-Ass wastes no time stepping up to the
Chinese

BAD-ASS
Leave a twenty for the drinks and
crawl the fuck outta here

The MUSIC DIES OFF leaving a searing tension in its
wake Po stares back with an almost infuriating
indifference

PO
Its all good Bra no worries
Im simply waiting to talk to a
friend

BAD-ASS
You dont have any friends in this
motherfucker Thats the problem

Patrons TALKING SMACK fuel this from the safety of the

crowd (Bye-bye you Chinese motherfucker etc) After a
beat

PO
Im no psychologist but you seem
like a pretty angry guy

BAD-ASS
You dont know the half of it

The table is JERKED OUT to extract Po when

A CADRE OF CHINESE

Steamrolls through the doors flat-out knocking people
aside Pound for pound these guys are every bit as hard-

core as their counterparts And you thought it was tense
before 7

Sung Family enforcer KAI (LATE 20S) walks the point
This guy would have Van Damme crapping his pants inside a
minute -- his face reflects that Sunglasses are canted
to reveal hard eyes and the bad attitude to go with ‘em

KAI
Let it go Po This is a hassle
we dont need

Po shrugs Another lazy smile But the Bad-Ass sticks a
hand into his chest keeping him from sliding out

Po SWIFTLY STRIKES -- the cane just a vague blur as it
CHOPS the hand down CRACKS ribs on both sides then
BUTTS the guy flush on the temple with the bone handle

Kai shoots him a What the fucks wrong with you look as
the man drops

KAI
(to his men)
et him o ide

A second bad-ass confronts the enforcer as Po is hustled
out

BAD-ASS 2
Take his place youll take his
ass-whipping as well

KAI
(lowers his sunglasses)
Bring whatever youve got

The young black takes him up on it -- but Kai SNAP-KICKS
the guys knee so quickly that his foot is back on the
ground by the time WE HEAR the ACL SNAP The enforcer
BOXES HIS EARS on the way down with a DEAFENING CLAP

Kai calmly breast-pockets his shades Then in the blink
of an eye its on

FULL VIEW - THE BATTLE

AS A BRUTAL MELEE ERUPTS across the casino Were
treated to a perfect blending of Martial Arts and Street
EXTREME HAND-TO-HAND STUFF showcasing the better elements
of both

One of the blacks CLOTHESLINES a Chinese throat Two
others TRADE OPEN SHOTS HaglerHearns-style until one
simply drops

Kai leads the pack racking ass at a furious pace He
TOSSES one guy through A GLASS PARTITION then puts the
wood to SEVERAL BROTHERS emerging from the crowd to lend
a hand 7

But one bad apple spoils the fun A Chinese is the first
to go for his piece Now a really nice moment as A DAISY
CHAIN OF HANDGUNS ARE DRAWN SIMULTANEOUSLY dropping into
place like a row of dominos

Black gun jammed to Chinese temple -- an Asian 45 stuck
in blacks belly -- Mr 45s spine scissored by a pair of
380s and so on

A long beat Both sides teetering on the brink of
annihilation Then THE SOUND OF A SHOTGUN BEING RACKED
rolls over the house PA

SILK
Stands next to the microphone holding the weapon Hes

the owner and sole proprietor of this casino and his AK-
47 TOTING BODYGUARDS now cover the room

SILK
Guns dont kill people -- people
kill people

He steps from the open DJ booth and starts down the
stairs

SILK (contd)
Now if youll excuse me

gentlemen youre disrupting my
business

Slowly the weapons are lowered

SILK (contd)
So if your ass isnt black you
best drag it out my establishment

Bad-Ass 2 hobbles upright to confront Kai

BAD-ASS
(cold lethal)
This shit is far from over

KAT
Fine -- well do it again once you
start walking

The Chinese gather themselves for the exits
EXT WATERFRONT CASINO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 8
Where Kai has Po pinned up against his Lexus
KAI
You wanna explain this to me

KAI (contd)

war What the hell were you doing
in there

PO
(blowing it off)
I decided to stop in for a few
drinks liven up the party
Whatever Im a big boy now

KALI

(directly)
You dont belong here -- or
anywhere like here -- ever

(shakes him)
Those fucks will bury you first
chance they get

Po sharply slaps his comrades hands away and shoves him
back

PO
You work for me Kai

KAI
For your father

PO
One and the same You dont give
orders -- you take them

KAT
Get your mind right Po As long
as theres a war going on youre
my responsibility

WIDER ANGLE

As Po throws his cane into the backseat of his black-on-
black Austin-Martin Climbs in and ABRUPTLY GUNS past an
arriving car to vanish into the night

The arriving driver gets out to watch the others
disperse This is our first glimpse of COLIN ODAY
(BLACK EARLY 20S) A late young man wondering what it
is hes just missed

EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - OAKLAND - DAWN 9

Where an African-American PAPERBOY bikes down a placid
street half-asleep as he delivers the morning edition

horror

Where Syndicate Overlord CHU SUNG (60S) channel-surfs
the MORNING SHOWS while chain-smoking his beloved
Marlboro Reds He looks to be a jocular man outwardly
sweetened by his advanced age and success occasionally
LAUGHING at the tv
His EVEN OLDER MAID finally drags away the lavish
breakfast tray hes ignored
MAID
(scolding in CHINESE)
Those filthy things are no kind of
breakfast Not good for you You
must eat something
CHU
(perfect English)
Lifes not good for you you old
hen It has a horrible prognosis
and always ends in death
She leaves in a pout A THROATY CHUCKLE escaping his
lips Within seconds DOORS BANG OPEN in the house

INT CHU SUNGS MANSION - MORNING 41

WE GET OUR FIRST GOOD LOOK at his palatial estate as Chu

hurries into the hall

If you were expecting dragon statues gilding and red

carpets youre out of luck -- this aint no Szechwan take-
out joint Everything is decidedly Californian making
the point that Sung is glad to have come to America and

shared in her riches

LONG SHOT - THE FOYER

Where Kai enters members of his cadre pouring in around

him

(CONTINUFD)

WE DONT HEAR THE WORDS he whispers in the old mans
ears But something seems to die inside Chu then face
withering with unthinkable anger

TIGHTER - CHU

Slowly turning away He stares out the window with
unseeing eyes The surface of his swimming pool rippling
gently in the breeze

THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS INTO the Pool until it FILLS THE
SCREEN and then WE MATCH CUT TO

EXT ISAAK ODAYS HOUSE - MORNING

-Another swimming pool perfectly mirroring the first
As WE BEGIN TO TRACK BACK OUT alone qolf—bali SPLASHES
the surface A beat A second ball follows

FAVORING - ISAAK ODAY (LATE 30S)

As he SHANKS yet a third shot froma chipping green The
self-made crime lord HEAVES his five-iron into the
landscaping and cinches the sash of his Armani pajamas

ISAAK
Fuck Tiger I hate this game

Then WE HEAR A PHONE RINGING inside the house
INT ISAAK ODAYS HOUSE - KITCHEN

Where the phone waits on the counter Isaak puts it to
his ear idly opening the refrigerator door

ISAAK
(talking into phone)
What do you have to tell me

He slips a half-gallon of milk from the ice box
dribbling some onto his chest as he takes a hit straight
out the carton

Its a small thing but very revealing -- the street
manners of the man abruptly peaking through to the
surface

ISAAK (contd)
(suddenly attentive)
Sungs boy Is that so Who did

it

(half beat)
Damned straight you better put it
together

43

Isaak CLICKS OFF face now clouded with concern After a
beat

warning The Head Guard now smirking over him

INT HSING-KANG PRISON - BEATING ROOM 18

No Amnesty International stickers here -- this is the
place where prisoners go to die The Riot Squad drags
Han in shellacking him with BATONS to the gut

Two guards prop him up as a long-chained shackle is
clamped to his left ankle The other cuff is to be
thrown over the ceiling beam to hoist him for a good
long beating

Evidently Han has other plans

His leg ROCKETS from the six to twelve position to KO
the man closest He JERKS THE CHAIN FREE from Number Two
then whips it back out COILING IT around the guys
neck

HOUSE PHONE to receive orders Takes a baton and

THUNDERS OUT for the main prison

Where Han at last enters his lost brothers world He
drifts in with the reverence of a churchgoer drinking in
the silent statements of Pos home and belongings

DESK DRAWERS

Han expertly searches them finding little more than old
letters and checkbook stubs the meaningless remnants of
our too brief lives

INSIDE THE CLOSET

Where he works through Pos extensive wardrobe Digging

through jacket pockets then slacks shaking out pair
after pair of expensive shoes

A tattered basketball finds him from the very top shelf
An emotional moment as he eases it down -- Po must have

kept it here as a reminder of that defining day on the
ocean and the strength of will it took them to survive

IN THE BATHROOM

Where Han rifles the medicine cabinet Systematically
dumping prescription bottles into the sink then rooting
through the rainbow of pills looking for something
anything that can help him

No luck He goes to work on the shaving kit
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

Ride along the living room wall Various images covering
the spectrum of the dead mans experience -- hanging out
with hotties at Fishermans Wharf leaning against a car
with a hot blonde tucked under each arm

Qne picture in particular monopolizes Hans attention
It shows Han and Po hugging tightly from the brink of
adulthood - Han wearing his police cadet uniform Po a
stylish jacket for Hong Kong of the time

The sadness of his loss cuts deep here Han sets the
picture down face a quiltwork of difficult emotion
Then his policemans eyes cheat to

Who among you hurts as much as I
But we must have the patience to
wait until the mud settles and the
water is clear

wiped out driving the families
apart

Such things are protected against
by the our newly-signed alliance
After dear Lao-Tzus passing his

policeman who allowed his brother
to escape a State Death in Hong
Kong The Family found great
honor there even though you were
never proud of this

HAN

Not proud no

There is Gods Law and mans law
Youve always well understood the
difference between them

Which law told you to abandon your
sons on the Mainland To flee
alone at night forcing them to
find their own way to Hong Kong

siphon away his strength

Still hanging crooked on the walls He goes to them

thoughtd be really funny He hid
out front while I ran to tell Mom

came running Colin was supposed
to jump out and surprise her and
then wed all have a good laugh
My mother she always loved a good
laugh

I was only eight or nine Colin
younger and I dont even remember
how we came up with it But sure
enough I started yelling and she
rushed outside

(softly)
And when I told her I mean the
look on her face She was just

crushed totally destroyed She
collapsed right there in the yard
weeping broken

Really Maybe I should be more
concerned with his daughters

The professional suite where Isaaks legitimate business
interests are overseen

Trish and Han recover here from their near-death escape
Theyve been through the ringer tonight and it shows --
hair trashed clothes still damp a cornucopia of cuts
and abrasions shared between them

Han notices a surveyors map of the Waterfront pulled down
across one wall Grids cleanly parceling the land into
zoning districts

HAN
I need a pen
TRISH
(motions)

Look in that desk
Han is digging one out when she notices
A SPOTTING OF BLOOD
Along the torn forearm of his jacket

TRISH
Take your jacket off

HAN
What

TRISH
Take it off

145

He hesitates briefly before peeling it away Blood has
completely mushroomed through his long-sleeved shirt
That jagged little 9mm wound refusing to clot up

HAN
Leave it

TRISH
(fat chance
Come over here

NEW ANGLE

Where she leads him to the industrial-sized office firs
aid kit in the kitchenette Starts the sink filling with
hot water

She SCISSORS his sleeve to examine the damage more
closely Nasty stuff -- narrow entry gaping exit The
good news is it passed right through

TRISH
You dont seem too bothered Not
the first time youve been shot
huh

(smiles)
Not even the second

SHARP HISS acs peroxide meets wound Trish empties a pack

into the water Wraps his arm in
dry gauze first then a second dressing dipped in the
starchy concoction

It hardens instantly Han STARTS IN SURPRISE as she RAPS
her knuckles on the bandage -- now a cast as solid asa
piece of wood

INT ISAAK ODAYS OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT 146
Where Han now marks up the hanging surveyor Ss map THE

CAMERA IS FRAMING HIM orki

on

Trish sits opposite watching A long beat before he
finishes

HAN
(flatly)
There is no war between black and
Chinese Its a smoke screen

SLOWLY NOW THE CAMERA CHEATS AROUND TO SHOW

FULL VIEW

Where the Waterfront District now has ink circles
cluttering the properties Han knows to have changed

hands

But Han is no longer listening

- THE MAP

HAN (contd)
Your father mine Theyve both
been doing the same thing

TRISH
(confused)
Take it slow here okay Doing
what

HAN
Grabbing up these properties -- as
many as they can get their hands
on

TRISH
But why the Waterfront Land
values have been dropping there
since I was a kid Most of its
already crackhead country

HAN
Dont know yet But both sides
have been killing their own for
it

an ugly realization
washes over him)
My brother was dead the moment he
found out about it No matter
what he did

TRISH
And Colin

HAN
Po must have called to see what
Colin knew -- what they could do
together to stop it

TRISH
But what would they want the land
for It still doesnt make any
sense

His policemans eyes

distracted by seve

well

several other maps
He slowly pulls down the closest

hanging overhead as

revealing 146

AN OPAQUE ACETATE
Stenciled in with a birds eye graphic of the new
football stadium The flat has been designed to

perfectly overlay the Waterfront grid -- illustrating

abandoned as Ivans Attorney goes through the Chinese
hi of rant deeds

WE NOTICE Kai shoot White Bread a scorching look

ROTH

He motions for a small briefcase to be brought over and
placed before the Overlord

ROTH (contd)
Spend it well

Chu springs the clasps and opens it LID TOWARDS US so we
cant see the contents Instead judging their value by
his look of complete satisfaction

CHU
I will Ivan I always have
(rising to go)
I dont expect well encounter
each other again so let this
serve as farewell Its beena
pleasure

He motions Kai to take the case

ROTH
(smiling)

INT ISAAK ODAYS OFFICE - NIGHT 148

Where Han is reviewing Trishs photocopied deed more
closely THE CAMERA FINDS the property recipient listed
as ROTH EQUITY HOLDI oe

HAN
All the properties are being
turned over to a single company --
Roth Equity Holdings It may be
just a shell maybe not

He folds the document and gives it to her

TRISH
What about you
HAN

owners
MAC (os)
Wrong Dim Sum Your ass is

Han whirls to find

MAC MAURICE AND THE DOGS

Filtering out of the shadows The dogs hold twelve-quage
shotguns at the hip ready for the slightest excuse to

cut Han in half

Maurice is a mess from his tangles with Han -- capped
teeth glinting dully arm splinted one eye purpled and
swollen But hes smiling plenty now theyve finally
captured the Chinese

MAC
Dont take it so hard brother
The Little Princess heres gonna
be fine

Mac takes hold of Trish and pulls her close Thena
really nice moment as he furrows his nose into her
hair

MAC (contd)
Whatta ya say baby Catch
another romantic dinner maybe a
few stiff drinks to put us in the
mood

Han motions to the stadium overlay

HAN
Its hard to build anything ona
mountain of bodies People will

MAC
You think any of these lives have
really mattered Your brothers
Colins They dont They never
did In this world theres only
the rich -- everyone else is just
an inconvenience

(to Maurice)

End this monkey Mo And please
take your time doin it

HAN AND TRISH
Share a final desperate glance from across the room

Her brave face fractured with panic as Mac hustles her
out

Its the last thing Han sees before his temple is BUTTED

with the heel of a shotgun
EXT TOP OF THE FIVES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Where Isaak arrives in his Town Car Just as the valet

is taking his keys Chu steps outside A strange beat as

the rivals find themselves abruptly face to face

Then the biggest shocker of all -- theyve been working
ISAAK

(sees the briefcase)
I see youve already finished with
Ivan

CHU
Yes -- your share is waiting
inside Rest assured the deal
was everything he promised

ISAAK
Did you ever doubt him

CHU
(slight smile)
Not really
(pauses)
It worked well didn’t it our
little war I was surprised how
many of my people wanted to
(MORE)

149
CHU (contd)
believe it was real How many
always will

ISAAK
It was lucrative if thats what
you mean
(then colder)
Except for an unexpected

casualty
CHU
Two unexpected casualities
ISAAK
Only one concerns me
CHU
(rolls reversed from the
airport)

I had nothing to do with it

ISAAK

Believe me Chu it wont take
much to find out

(reigns it in)
But thats a personal matter best
left to personal time Our
business tonight is something else
entirely

They share a hard look as the Chinese Overlords car
arrives

INT ISAAK ODAYS OFFICE - NIGHT 150
Where Han regains consciousness in the midst of THE WORST
STOMPING OF HIS LIFE Maurice and his dogs have him

chained to a support column and

A MAGNIFICENT BEATING

Takes place as the they work him over This is an

unpleasant sequence sadistic and methodical and should
resonate with the emotional anguish of Toshiro Mifunes
dismantling in Yoiimbo

It should play for less than a minute yet feel like days
and days

MAURICE
(stopping them at last)
Alright alright already
CLOSE ON - HAN

Sagging back against the column His scalp and gums are
bloodied and outwardly he seems a ruined husk of a man

( )

150

MAURICE (contd)
I like to be able to at least
recognize a motherfucker when Im
breaking him up

They catch their breath One shaking the sting of so
Many punches from his hand

DOG 2
Lets just do him Mo

DOG 1
Yeah Im burn-out on this shit

Maurice shrugs and digs out a weapon Leans down to grab
a handful of Hans hair

MAURICE
Hear that Dim Sum Time go
nighty night
(then curious)
One thing I gotta know bro -- you
didnt really think you was gonna
get them drawers

HAN
(raspy spitting out
blood)
What

MAURICE
That ass bro Trish You really
think she was gonna give it up to
you

His posse chimes in with ADDITIONAL SMACK (Damn dawg
“Aw shit etc) Han doesnt respond

MAURICE (contd)
Didnt think so Best you didnt
even try -- after Isaak turns over
the deeds at the Top 0 The Fives
Macs giving himself a big
promotion

(off Hans reaction)

Hell yeah Gonna dump ODay into
the Bay and take Number One
Daughter and all that cash for
himself and his dogs

Again Han fails to reply his eyes flickering like that
of a beaten fighter

MAURI

CE
All right fellas lets do this
Young Romeo heres gotta die

150A

CREW 1
Whoa Mo You cant shoot him

MAURICE

And exactly why not

CREW 1

carpets This is gonna be his
office now

MAURICE
Yeah dawg You right
(half beat)

Lets throw him out the window

CREW 1
What about the glass

MAURICE
(Lightbulb comes on)
Well open it first

And they do Then they grab Hans limbs like four pall
bearers and get a running start --
the large window
SLOW MOTION - HAN
His body being pitched into open space His left hand
SUDDENLY ROCKETS OUT to grab the sill his right
Maurices tie
He hangs there but a millisecond Maurice fighting to
brace himself against the inside
HAN

You aint the only one knows some

shit
And with a YANK they both go spiraling out
EXT ISAAK ODAYS OFFICE - NIGHT
Where WE WATCH as Han and Maurice plummet for the

pavement The Chinese now pulls A SPECTACULAR MOVE --
spinning Mo underneath him in mid-air to use him as a
human air bag

WIDER ANGLE
Next stop ground floor ice
THE FULL IMPACT OF THE FALL It leaves him GROANING

LIMPLY as flat as a pancake

Han gets up and dusts himself off Escapes with the
others still watching spellbound from above

EXT TOP OF THE FIVES RESTAURANT - NIGHT 151

Where Isaak stands outside the entrance as Mac and his
bad-asses arrive

Strain is now apparent on the crimeboss face for the
first time Hes allowed himself to envision a new life
for he and Trish -- and the price of it is an inevitable
vulnerability

Mac is loving every minute of it Silently pleased at
the prospect of his boss having slipped from his game
ace

ISAAK
Trish should already be here by
now
(checking watch)
Mac -- are you positive theyve
picked her up

MAC
Isaak man you gotta relax I
talked to Mo and the boys not ten
minutes ago Shes safe and shes
on the way

INT TOP OF THE FIVES RESTAURANT - NIGHT 152

Where Isaak and Mac enter They see Ivan with his
attorney and join them at the table

ROTH

Mac passes a small valise across to him Roth hands it
straight-away to his attorney

ROTH

TSAAK

The attorney quickly thumbs the forms inside

ISAAK

ROTH
Excellent spirits I expect very
shortly youll be in the same

ATTORNEY
(finished)
Perfect Everythings in order
ROTH

He motions for a small briefcase to be brought for Isaak
-- its identical to that given the Chinese earlier

ROTH
And this belongs to you Per our
agreement I think youll be very
pleased

ISAAK
(spins it on him)
Do I need to have Gummy here

VIEW OF - GUMMY

One of the baddies -- baby dreads wired eyes jaws
maniacally pumping his chewing gum back and forth The
absolute antithesis of Ivans Ivy-League asshole

ROTH
(touché)
No Its all there

Isaak draws the case to him anyway A beat Then he
shocks everyone by pushing it back unopened

ISAAK

Keep your cheddar Ivan Id
rather you invest it for me

Nobody knows what to make of this -- Ivan and his
Attorney slack-jawed Mac fit to have a major coronary

ROTH
Isaak Im afraid I dont
understand

ISAAK
Its easy Im going to be your
Partner 152

ROTH
My

ISAAK

Sure High-time the NFL had a
black owner dont think

(lets it sink in)
Im up to the task -- trust me
Used to play a little ball myself
And I do look fantastic inside a
luxury-box

ROTH

(regains his composure)
Im afraid I already have
partners several in fact

Isaak turns intimidating The kind of power which
underscores his ascension from the wasteland of an
Oakland ghetto

ISAAK
So add another one The bids
already been accepted Without my
deeds youre a short hair from
ending up in a meat locker
yourself

Long beat Ivan fully realizing the bad spot hes in
Then Mac cant take anymore

MAC
Fuck the luxury box -- Ill take
the green

Isaak finds a fire-breathing Sig-Sauer angled smack at
his belly Mac scoops up the briefcase intoxicated by
the lure of all that cash

ISAAK
What are you doing

MAC

I believe they call it corporate
restructurin As of right now
ODay Enterprises is being
swallowed whole by Mac Inc Im
taking your capital reserves

(holds up the case)
And your most valued asset

He signals his dogs and Trish is escorted inside
MAC (contd)

And then Im gonna leverage you
out

( )

152 152

Isaak makes a vicious lunge for him fearless in his rage
at betrayal

ISAAK
You shitty little bloodsucker I
carried your ass off the
streets

MAC
Yeah sure -- but what have you

done for me lately

Mac GUT-SHOOTS his mentor crumpling him to the floor
His daughter rushes to his side

TRISH
Qh God

Mac could care less HURRIEDLY SPRINGING THE CLASPS to
get to the good part

MAC
Now lets see some shit

Theres nothing inside but a-white envelope He snatches
it up and rips it open

A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATE CHECK

Made out to QDAY ENTERPRISES confronts him Mac about
craps himself

MAC

I dont believe this

Isaaks WOUNDED LAUGH mocks him from the floor

ISAAK
Punk Now look at your street

MAC
(livid)
Better hope you stay alive long
enough to bank this
motherfucker

TO BE WRITTEN Han BURSTS IN and A FANTASTIC SHOOT-OUT
FOLLOWS between Roths Bodyguards and the blacks In all
the commotion Roth runs to the roof where a helicopter
awaits But Mac BLOWS HIM AWAY before he can escape

Han takes out the remaining soldiers and then faces off
with Mac

152 152

HAN
Two-man game now Mac

The young lieutenant leans back to rake his barrel across
the nape of Trishs neck

MAC
You forgettin about the broad
Ahkbar Baby makes three

HAN
(dispassionate)
I want to know why you murdered my
brother

MAC
Wasnt me I killed Colin
alright Isaak didnt know a thing
about it Couldnt risk him
killin the deal

HAN
(insistent)
What about Po

MAC
You got your own people to thank
there All that shit was handled
in-house

Han feels his blood roiling the depth of what this means
almost unfathomable

MAC (contd)
Now get on your knees or Ill

smoke her

HAN
Behind you

MAC
If that aint some tired
bullshit

But Hans gaze convinces the thug hes for real Mac
turns slowly to find

TRISH
1 ni im wi ia
hands
TRISH
Like you said Mac -- Im getting

all misty eyed 152

She FIRES to put him down

TRISH (contd)
wishing there were two of you

The SECOND ROUND finishes him
WIDER ANGLE
As Han and Trish kneel to check Isaaks wound

Its real bad but hes hanging in WE HOLD FOR A MOMENT
on the ex-gangster his eyes now silently doing what his
seized throat cannot -- thanking Han for saving his
daughter and himself

Han covers him with his jacket Gently places a finger
to Trishs lips before leaving

EXT CHU SUNGS MANSION - GREENHOUSE - NIGHT 153

Where Han covers the glass pane over the doors deadbolt
and SOUNDLESSLY KNOCKS IT OUT

INT CHU SUNGS MANSION - GREENHOUSE - NIGHT 154

A lavish second floor housing bright Asian flora Below
them a pool of exotic fish consumes the entire ground
level

Han enters the lush greenery For a moment were taken
aback feeling as if weve awoken in the humid heart of
an Asian jungle Han wanders in

KAT
KAI
It was strangely exhilarating

killing Po Really gave me a
rush

HAN
Why doesnt that surprise me

KAI
(with distaste)
Your brother wasnt suited to
lead Han Sung He didnt have
the stomach for it the necessary
balls

HAN
You believed yourself a much
better choice

154
KAL
Naturally
(then)
Why dont we settle this properly
NEW ANGLE
As again they take stances opposite each other -- their

former kinship replaced by an unbridled and unabashed
hatred

This is the most scintillating moment in the entire
movie A MARTIAL ARTS BATTLE ROYAL beginning only two
men of this caliber could create

There is a vicious grace to the combat their contrasting
styles well-suited Kai the younger and more aggressive
Han more patient and precise

Han launches A HURRICANE OF KICKS forcing his enemy
back Kai responds with A COMBINATION OF PUNCHES
hunting and pecking away to the body

Then Han raises the ante Grabbing Kais neck and
unleashing A SERIES OF HEAD-TO-KNEES -- face forced down
knee savagely coming up to tenderize it Kai SPINS FREE
and SLAMS KICKS to Hans groin and solar plexus sucking
the air out him And so “he war rages

WIDE TWO SHOT - HAN AND KAI

Ultimately coming to a stand-still Both hurt and
hemorrhaging from nose and mouth each man now proven the
others equal

KALI
The old man was afraid you might
win Han Sung

HAN
And you
KAI
I knew you wouldnt
The FIGHT CONTINUES (DETAILS BEING DISCUSSED) as Kai

appears to take the upper hand Han then rallies himself
to permanently extinguish his brothers killer

(ED NOTE We need to find a great way to pay off

1 here which weve well established earlier in

the film)

INT CHU SUNGS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT 155

Where Chu works at his desk planning for the even
brighter future his fat take will afford him

( )
155

Then his youngest son Han Sung walks through the door

HAN
(MANDARIN)
What is it like Father

He brings Kais weapon up and trains it on the old mans
heart

HAN (contd)
(MANDARIN)
To go on living with your own
sons death Can you sleep Can
you even eat without his face
finding you

CHU
Outwardly Po was always the
stronger of you But inside he
was always weak Weak and sickly
with compassion for strangers
outsiders He put his own
interests -- their interests --
above those of the family

HAN
(MANDARIN)
What family There is only you
and your money When has it ever
been any different
(bitter laugh)
The Mainland Hong Kong

CHU
What he knew would have ruined
things with Roth would have
ruined us I did everything I
could to scare him off

HAN
Except the right thing Except
what you knew was right
(torn apart)
To take his side and be his
father

Han stands teetering with an unendurable amount of rage
Never has he wanted to kill with the hunger he does right
now

CHU
(unaffected)
What do you assume to do with me
Have your vengeance Will that
bring him back Han

89 155

HAN
No I have honored my brother
properly -- I found those
responsible for his death
(slowly)
The rest is for others strangers

Han RACKS A SINGLE ROUND into the chamber and SLIDES the
weapons full clip into his pocket

T th b

HAN
If the police dont get you the
other Chinese families will

He slides it across Giving the old man just one bullet
to do his bidding One bullet for either himself or his
son

HAN (contd)
Do what you will Chu But this
time no one will go to prison for
you

It serves as their final good-bye

Han slowly turns and
wi Completely exposing himself to
the mercy of his murderous father

Chu picks up the weapon levels it Hans back
HANS POV - LOOKING OUTSIDE

Where DISTANT SIRENS momentarily precede A PACK OF COP
CARS FISH-TAILING onto the street and SPEEDING for the
long stone driveway

But still Han doesnt turn Giving his father the
cleanest of shots at a motionless target

Chu clinches the weapon with TREMBLING hands finger
coiling around the trigger

BLAAMM THE GUN FIRES Its WHITE FLASH BLINDING THE ROOM
as WE HARD CUT TO --

EXT CHU SUNGS MANSION - NIGHT 156
Where THE ARMADA OF BLACK-AND-WHITES are now SCREAMING up

to the front STROBING the yard with harsh red and blue
rack-lights

Trish emerges from the back of a patrol car -- A

MATRIX-
STYLE SLOW-MOTION FIGURE centered in A FAST-MOTION FLURRY
OF ARMED COPS

156

Her eyes are lost in silent prayer as they strafe the
house A punishing beat Then

HAN
Emerges from inside in MATRIX-STYLE SLOW-MOTION as well

The Chinese resembles a human train wreck at this point
completely trashed by his long odyssey But he alone
stands as sole survivor

The couple cuts a path through the circus of law
enforcement STAYING IN SLOW-MOTION focused only on each
other

TIGHT TWO SHOT - HAN AND TRISH

Where he scans her face before they touch -- the gentle
lilt tells him Isaak is going to be alright Then they
come together in a long dreamed-of embrace

Trish softly pulls free Leans in to kiss him

You know it is a great country He just might stay
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as Trish holds tightly to Hans
hand the couple centered within the chaos THEN BACK
FURTHER STILL AS WE

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
