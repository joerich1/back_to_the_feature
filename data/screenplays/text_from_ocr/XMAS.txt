different things
LITTLE GIRL
Is that why you look different

ISAAC
What do you mean

LITTLE GIRL
Your hair is curly and brown and
you have a big nose And you just
look funny

ISAAC
That That’s because of inbreeding

LITTLE GIRL
What’s inbreeding

other Jews but we’re all from the
same village So it’s technically
inbreeding It’s kinda like--have
you ever seen Game of Thrones

my daddy--he’s just not around

wouldn’t have a Jew

Gentlemen 10 years ago my father
James Anthony Fletcher passed
away And you guys were there for
me That night we formed the most
beautiful tradition in the history
of bros

(beat)
See guys for years Christmas was
only for the devoutly religious
people who actually liked their
families and people who loved to
buy stuff It was never for people
like us the ones from broken
homes the ones without parents
the non-believers What were people
like us supposed to do on
Christmas What were people whose
fucking dads died supposed to do on
Christmas Sit around and watch
heartwarming movies FUCK THAT So
ten years ago we made a life-
changing decision We said “We
will not go gently into that silent
night” We said “No more”

(beat)
We were taking Christmas back New
Years New Years is for amateurs

bar in this city

are open on Christmas Eve for no
good reason at all And then this

Fine AIDS aside we also need more
space A yard

ETHAN
A yard You don’t need a yard You

character And you can just walk
around them I mean we wouldn’t be

crackheads have been dumped in the
ocean or whatever the fuck he did

Isaac declare you Isaac unfit to
be a father I know that and you
know that but ABSOLUTELY NO ONE
ELSE CAN KNOW This is not just the
drugs talking Actually this is
the drugs talking The drugs have
given you clarity The drugs are
making some very salient points

understand me You are so immature

You are mentally and emotionally
unfit to be a father and it is
incredibly irresponsible to even

Put it up for adoption Leave it on
a doorstep Take a weaving course
make a basket and send that baby
down the river like Moses

places he’s met us before

HF

Ethan walks away checks his phone Isaac turns to Chris

whispers

ISAAC

ISAAC

CHRIS

ISAAC

took a suite at the Crosby

ETHAN
But she’s all alone On Christmas

CHRIS

INT CHRIS’S ROOM - LATER

A Billy Joel Greatest Hits CD lies next to an old Discman
hooked into an old boombox Chris plays NFL 2K with Ethan on
the Nintendo 64 Ethan reads his old high school YEARBOOK
Open to a page of he and his friends splashing the fountain

at the Metropolitan Museum He flips the page sees his name

MOST LIKELY TO BECOME THE NEXT EDDIE VEDDER Ethan Fletcher

Along with a picture of a long-haired Ethan shredding a
guitar

CHRIS
So do you know how you’re gonna do
it

ETHAN

I was thinking I could play her
favorite song for her Wrecking
Ball

CHRIS
Her favorite song is Wrecking Ball

ETHAN
Miley Cyrus is her favorite You
guys think I should propose and
then sing Wrecking Ball after she
says yes Or do I sing the song
first and then ask her

We see Isaac is wrapped in blankets on Chris’ childhood bed
only his beard and eyes poking out

ISAAC
I’m so cold No matter how many
blankets I wrap myself in I’m cold
It’s like the more blankets the
colder I get Guys why is this
happening to me

CHRIS
‘Cause you ate way too many
mushrooms

TSAAC
Yeah but whose fault is that

HH HF HH

Blue (mmddyyyy)

ETHAN
Yours Only yours

ISAAC
As long as Betsy never finds out
well be able to survive the
winter

Chris and Ethan go back to their conversation

ETHAN
Should go home and grab my guitar
Or just sing a capella

ISAAC
(to himself)
Never-ending winter

ETHAN
Oh You know what’d be dope I
should sing in front of the whole
party Just go balls to the wall

CHRIS
No no no Definitely don’t do
that Play it cool Just take her
aside and have a nice private
moment

ETHAN
But I want to do something special
Girls love it when guys take a
chance I’ve gotta do it in front
of everyone Remember senior year
when I sang that Mr Jones to Kelly
Jones and cleverly changed the name
to Miss Jones

CHRIS
-I still can’t believe you got to
hook up with her

ETHAN
I did so well in high school Lotta
hand jobs

CHRIS
Oh shit This is the best part of
the song Right here

ETHAN
You’re the only black person I know
who likes Billy Joel

Blue (mmddyyyy)

CHRIS

The guys share a comfortable silence

CHRIS (CONT’D)

You know my dad’s not friends with
any of the guys he went to high
school with His best friend is the
dude he sits next to at work

(beat)
They play tennis together They eat
dinner once a month at My Big Fat
Greek Restaurant

ETHAN
And now our boy Isaac is about to
be a father himself
(beat)
End of an era

CHRIS
End of an era

ISAAC
You guys I just came up with the
greatest idea of the 20th century
After my winter child is born we
will raise her as god intended
children to be raised - by three
men Three men and a baby We all
join forces to create one great
man Like 3 Men and a Baby I1l1 be
Selleck Tom Mustachio’d
daredevil I’d just like an excuse
to grow a big moustache--

Chris and Ethan start laughing

ETHAN
I feel like I radiate the sly charm
and mild sexual aggression of a
young Ted Danson

CHRIS
So I guess I’1ll be the other white
guy

ISAAC
His name is Steve Guttenberg And
he’s the best one Dudes If we
make Steve Guttenberg black maybe
that’1l make up for all that
slavery

(MORE )

HH

Blue (mmddyyyy) 61

ISAAC (CONTD)
Or at least it’1ll be a start
(beat)
You guys hungry I’m getting a
little peckish

CHRIS

No food We don’t leave this room
ISAAC

We’re going to have to eat each

other
Now Ethan’s phone vibrates He looks at it

ETHAN
He’s downstairs

CHRIS
I went last time

ISAAC
I’1ll go I gotta puke anyways

ETHAN
You sure dude

ISAAC
Yeah guys I’ll be fine as long

Isaac wrapped in a blanket heads out
CHRIS
Make sure to be quiet Don’t wake

blankets dirty

INT LOBBY - NIGHT

The elevator door opens Isaac exits the elevator into the
almost surreal lobby lit by blinking multicolored Christmas
lights

ISAAC
Alright lobby let’s dance

EXT CHRIS’ MOM’S HOUSE 56

And vomits loudly And there’s Mr Green parked in his car
He honks the horn flashes the lights

Blue (mmddyyyy)

INT CHRIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chris plays Nintendo Ethan looks down at his phone

CHRIS
It’s funny how horribly he’s
handling this I mean I’ve seen
people handle shit badly but this
is comical Most guys I play with
have like 7 kids They don’t give a
shit

ETHAN
Yo have your friends called yet
with the address

CHRIS
No They have not called with the
address

ETHAN
Okay
(beat)
Are you sure

CHRIS
I have literally had my hand on my
phone all night in case its starts
to vibrate

ETHAN
Well do you just have it on
vibrate Or vibrate and ring
That’s the fail safe

Chris gives Ethan a look

ETHAN (CONTD)
Sorry I don’t mean to be pushy
Tonight’s just a big deal Some
pretty life-changing shit is going
down for me--

CHRIS
It’s a big deal for me too man
You see the desperation in my eyes
I need to get to that party as
badly as you do

ETHAN
Why You shouldn’t be desperate
about anything You’re rich And
famous And pretty fucking sexy

H

FH FH

Blue (mmddyyyy) 63

CHRIS
Well a lot of pressure comes with
that Tonight has to be perfect I
only get one shot at this
(frustrated)
Where the fuck is Isaac

EXT CHRIS’ MOM’S HOUSE 56

And vomits loudly And there’s Mr Green parked in his car
He honks the horn flashes the lights

INT MR GREEN’S CAR 58

Isaac gets in Mr Green puffs on a joint The car is filled
with smoke Mr Green turns the ignition takes off

MR GREEN
So what can I get you

ISAAC
A morning after pill and a time
machine that can take me back about
8 and a half months

MR GREEN
What

ISAAC
I don’t know man I’m pretty
fucked up My friend sent me here
Who are you again

MR GREEN

ISAAC
Right Nice Maybe that’1l level me

MR GREEN

Hybrid Or like something that
shows you the future

ISAAC

guess I’1ll just take the last one
you said

HF HH

MR GREEN
Yeah Yeah you will

Mr Green packs a bowl and passes it to him

MR GREEN (CONTD)
Here have a taste Make sure you
like it

Isaac takes the pipe and takes a hit A ploom of cloud comes
out of his mouth and hazes around his head He coughs
ferociously then looks up and is in a completely dark room

ISAAC
Hello Hello Mr Drug Dealer
Where am I

INT STRIP CLUB 59

A muted version of POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME starts playing A
kind of scary version A spotlight beams down and reveals a
pole in the middle of the room A hot STRIPPER starts dancing
and the lights raise a bit to reveal an awesome strip club
filled with men waving money

ISAAC
Whoa man this is amazing weed
And an aaaaaamazing strip club

MR GREEN (0S)
Is it

Isaac sees Mr Green beside him smoking a blunt

ISAAC
Wh what do you mean

UNSEEN ANNOUNCER (0S)
Annnnnnnnd next on the stage we
have ISAAC’S DAUGHTER

An unbelievably trashy looking girl with a tattoo of a cross
intertwined with a Jewish star on her lower back takes the
stage

ISAAC
Wait I’m not the Isaac he’s
talking about right Tell me
there’s another Isaac Tell me
there’s another Isaac

Blue (mmddyyyy) 65

MR GREEN
I’m sorry but you’re the only
Isaac here

ISAAC

Mr Green blows a huge puff of smoke in Isaac’s face and the
weed smoke swirls around him and everything starts spinning
We focus on Isaac’s face as what seems to be different
Christmas lights flash against his face akin to 2001 A Space
Odyssey Isaac screams and we hard cut to-

INT MR GREEN’S CAR -— CONTINUOUS 60
Isaac is screaming in Mr Greens car

MR GREEN
Hey Hey Quit it man I run an
illegal business here I can’t have
you screaming like you just got
murdered

ISAAC
But everyone’s gonna get lap dances
from my daughter

MR GREEN
What

TSAAC
That vision of the future

MR GREEN
Yo man you’re gonna have to go
now It’ll be 100 bucks for the
weed

ISAAC
Anything you want just make the
pain stop

Isaac throws all the money in his wallet at Mr Green and
takes the weed and starts to get out

MR GREEN
See you at 257 yo

ISAAC
What

MR GREEN

Youll see

Blue (mmddyyyy) 66

Mr Green drives away leaving a horrified Isaac on the side
of the road

INT CHRIS’S MOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT 61

Isaac steps back Chris’ house Shutting the door quietly
behind him He gingerly steps through the apartment He bumps
into a table accidentally knocking over a vase

Right before it crashes to the ground he grabs it He
exhales keeps moving

Now his phone RINGS The ringtone is Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy”
Chris sticks his head into the hallway looks at Ethan

CHRIS

the table To Isaac it is a black tentacle dripping with
viscous goo Isaac wills himself to say

ISAAC

Just as her turns the corner Ethan consults his phone

ETHAN

molly’s starting to kick in now

In the distance the sound of CAROLERS Now Isaac turns
see a throng of carolers He closes his eyes basking in
their dulcet tones He opens his eyes sees her BETSY

She frowns at him
And Ethan steps out of the Porta-Potty

He watches as Ushers urge the carolers inside And now it’s
quiet

Ethan stands there alone
He pulls out his phone and sees he received a text from Diana
“This happening Where am I going” He responds “Definitely

happening Address coming soon Can’t wait to see you”

Ethan smiles and digs into his pocket pulling out the ring
He looks at it proud and excited

Behind Ethan we see someone approaching - it appears to be
Santa Claus

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Chris spots Q’Uisha at the end of an alley He runs after
her He’s gaining on her He’s about to catch her

And she turns a corner onto a thin cluttered alley In an
elaborate series of parkour-like moves she leaps over a
garbage can with a fire in it She kicks it back Chris leaps
over it

She keeps running comes upon a series of boxes that create a
staircase leading over a fence She deftly runs over them
stepping on specific ones and hops the fence

Chris reaches the boxes runs on them and one of them gives
way beneath him dropping him five feet

CHRIS
Aaargh

He pushes himself up looks up and climbs the fence
Q’Uisha’s at the end of the alley She disappears around the
corner

Chris looks down recommits himself to the fight

Keeps running

INT ST PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

A packed midnight mass A choir sings “Hark the Herald Angels
Sing” Isaac sits there amongst families and beautiful
beaming children Isaac’s eyes wander around the Church

Stained-glass images and statues of Christ on the cross He
catches Nana giving him a look like “That’s right Your
people did that” Betsy leans over whispers to him

BETSY
If you’re gonna violate my one
rule you’re gonna sit through this

a penis on the screen

BETSY (CONTD)

hog Kind of hog that’d win the
county fair know what I mean

BETSY
Shut the fuck up What are you

mosaic etched into the ceiling burning hellfire

He turns away sees a BABY crying The child’s MOTHER smiles
apologetically Isaac turns sees Jesus on the cross

ISAAC

BETSY
Don’t throw up

ISAAC

air

The whole congregation turns

Isaac looks up sees the whole congregation looking at him

And runs out of the church

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT 77

Chris chases after Q’Uisha He spots something a SHOE He
picks it up hurls it at Q’Uisha She doesn’t break stride
sees the reflection of the shoe in a broken mirror next to
her ducks It whizzes past her missing her head by inches

She climbs up a fire escape with cat-like agility He follows
her She runs to the edge of roof looks back with steely
eyes
Blue (mmddyyyy) 88
CHRIS
Q’Uisha Don’t

She nods and gracefully falls backwards in slow-motion Her
eyes remain locked on Chris

CHRIS (CONTD)
No Q’Uisha

She’s about to hit the ground At the last moment she
expertly contorts her body and gently lands in a dumpster
She looks up daring him to follow

CHRIS (CONT’D)

They lock eyes As Q’Uisha throws her hoodie up like a
cloak and disappears into the night Chris looks down at his
dick
It’s hard
CHRIS (CONTD)
Damn She’s hot

CHRIS

ISAAC

coursing through your veins

INT SUBWAY - NIGHT

The guys wait on a train platform Ethan looks down sullen

CHRIS
Hey maybe this is for the best
man I mean you guys aren’t even
technically going out right Maybe
you need some more time to think
about this you know

ETHAN

The only fucking reason you don’t
want me to propose is because its
going to embarrass you in front of
you douchebag fucking friends who
are CLEARLY not your friends I
don’t know why we’re even still
referring to them as your friends

CHRIS
Fuck you Ethan Way to kick me
while I’m down I might have AIDS

ETHAN
That’s your own fucking fault Why
don’t you wear a condom like a
normal human being instead of
acting like a 16 year old It’s
fucking idiotic If you end up with
AIDs you deserve it

ISAAC
Calm down man You’re gonna ruin
the night--

ETHAN
I’m gonna ruin the night You’ve
been ruining the night ALL NIGHT
cuz you’ve been doing drugs non-

ETHAN
Youre rich and famous and Isaac’s
a fucking perfect picture of the
American dream with a fucking

Hmmm

He wanders toward the stage and sees MILEY CYRUS

ETHAN (CONT’D)
Holy fuck

He starts thinking and has an idea Nervously he heads toward
her then his confidence builds as he approaches He taps
Miley on the shoulder

ETHAN (CONT’D)
Pardon me Miss Cyrus I hate to
bother you but I have a quick
question There’s a girl coming
here tonight and she’s a massive
fan and Wrecking Ball is literally
her favorite song ever and I was
going to sing it to her here
tonight and then propose to her
I’m sure your very busy but the
fact that you’re here seems like a
Christmas miracle and I just have
to ask if there’s any chance you
would be into maybe being part of
my proposal

Miley stares at him thinking

MILEY
Sowhat’re you thinking

Ethan can’t believe there’s even a chance

ETHAN
I mean I guess ideally you would
start playing Wrecking Ball and Id
come out at the end and get on one
knee and propose It would blow her
mind

MILEY
But you were gonna sing the song
yourself right So you can sing

ETHAN
I mean not well but--

e e HF HF HH HF

H

HF

Blue (mmddyyyy) 103
MILEY
If you can sing why don’t you just
sing with me Then like when the
song crescendos you should drop to
one knee and just do it
ETHAN
Oh my god Miss Cyrus this is just
the greatest thing anyone has ever
done for me
MILEY
I mean it’s too romantic for me to
say no But you have to stop
calling me Miss Cyrus

believe this is happening UNREAL

burned out skyline of New York City

ETHAN
Whoa What’s this

MR GREEN
This is what would have happened if
your father had never died It
would have caused a Butterfly
Effect that altered the Earth’s
orbit and placed it directly in the
path of a giant asteroid thereby
destroying New York and turning the
only survivors into mutants who
shoot fire out of their vaginas and
dickholes

ETHAN
Wait what What happens when they
fuck each other

MR GREEN

CHRIS

Ethan I was thinking you
shouldn’t be so scared to put your
shit onto us you know We used to
tell each other our problems all

needed to figure my shit out

ISAAC

just assumed she wanted nothing to
do with me anymore since I made a
total fucking fool of myself

ISAAC

ETHAN
(thinking)

CHRIS

you guys

ETHAN
