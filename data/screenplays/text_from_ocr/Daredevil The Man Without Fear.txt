EXT NEW YORK CITY STREET - HELLS KITCHEN - PRESENT TIME

The West Side of Manhattan known as Hells Kitchen On the heels of a
rainstorm Mammoth darkened buildings Shadowy sidewalks Steam rising
from the manhole covers and underground exhausts Wide black streets
Deserted for now Wooden signs heralding future construction projects

A solitary figure crawls slowly in the shadows carefully avoiding the light
For an instant his pale blue EYES catch the glow of a cars headlights
There is not even the slightest reaction in his pupils They are sightless
condemned to the eternal night

The CAMERA follows the figure and TRACKS on a long band of yellow police tape
cordoning off a newly-burned brownstone

A distant ROCK N ROLL BEAT

EXT NEW YORK CITY - HELLS KITCHEN - 157 - AFTERNOON

and
SPRINGSTEENS ITS HARD TO B A BAINT IN THE CITY A MATCHING SHOT
TRACKING WITH a GROUP of BOYS ‘strutting down the same street and we are
transported back to a late Summer day in 1973 The streets are lined with
tenements taverns an 24-hour diners Families share the neighborhood with
whores junkies and small me hoods The Boys range in age from 12 to 15
They affect the tough hardened attitude that comes from spending all of
their waking hours on the streets SUPER Manhattan 1973 Late August’

Two stunning blue EYES in which Hells Kitchen and all its life seem to be
reflected for a brief moment These are the eyes of MATT MURDOCK a skinny
fifteen year-old redhead bringing up the rear Hes younger and slighter
than the others Hes trying to keep up to be cool and tough but there is
a certain complexity a level of maturity and intelligence that the others
are lacking Something in his eyes

STARKEY the hefty group bully stops the others and turns suddenly on Matt

STARKEY
Hey Murdock Hes all yours The fat ass

‘He nods across the street toward OFFICER LIPINSKI an overweight policeman
who walks the Hells Kitchen beat

MATT

Lipinski wheezing and staggering arrives at the alley entrance

EXT SMALL ALLEYWAY - DAY

Matt jumps again this time catching a lose chain dangling froma fire

It seems that nobody but Matt visits this place and he has made it into mis”
own private kingdom There is a weathered punching bag and some dusty
gymnastic equipment

Matt flips on the light switch The apartment is an eclectic blend of hand-
me-down furniture Jack Murdock looks very different from the youthful
fighter on the boxing poster Heavier his black hair streaked with grey
He hides the photograph in the side of the seat cushion then stands up
His eyes ablaze he glares at Matt

JACK
I found this on the roof
Jack thrusts a duffel bag at Matt Strides toward him then turns the bag
upside down spilling the STOLEN CONTENTS onto the floor several wallets a
wristwatch a womans necklace

the window and climbs out onto the fire escape Jack drops down on a
tattered ottoman clutching his head in his hands

EXT ROOF - NIGHT - LATER

Matt attacks the PUNCHING BAG with incredible fury his young arms punching
like metal pistons He doesnt stop Punching HARDER And HARDER Sweat
pouring CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Matt There is fire in his eyes A sense
of guilt and frustration in his expression LATER Matt is sitting on the
edge of the roof with his legs dangling over the side Tears are streaming
from his eyes while he stares into the night

his son sitting in such a precarious position

Jacks moves his finger through the air pointing at che endless lights
Matts eyes follow its movement Out of the CACOPHONY OF TRAFFIC several
sounds can be distinguished POLICE SIRENS -- a woman WEEPING -- two men

to the seven other arsons set off around Manhattan in
the last few months

MATT
I have no doubts about it

1ST REPORTER
And weve finally put our hands on the arsonist

MATT
For all we know he may be just the trigger-man
Whats really important is finding out if there is
anybody behind him And if that is the case who he
is and why

2ND REPORTER
Do you believe the explosion couldve been part of a
gang war between drug dealers

MATT
So it may seem But w y burn the whole building
a Maybe somebody wants us to Believe its just a shoot-
Co out between drug deer Maybe theres another
agenda

Bullseye

What are you saying

Innocent people have died in those fires There are
those who expect Daredevil to do justice right here
on the spot

MATT
People like Bullseye would rule the world were it
not for a structure of laws created by society to
keep such men in check The moment one man takes
another mans life in his own hands he is working to
destroy that structure If Bullseye is a menace to
society society must make him pay the price Not
you Not me And not Daredevil Im sure everybody
hates what Bullseye does what he is But we are
not God

Bullseye sits ominously in a strange hi-tech constriction chair that
makes him look like a futuristic version of Hannibal Lecter His HEAD is
SHAVED Next to him sits OSWALD MORRIS his greasy fat attorney

DIANE
Ladies and Gentlemen the defense will tell you that
there is no evidence the defendant put the bomb
inside The Sandworm And that his recognized
anti-social behavior doesn’ t necessarily make hima
mass murderer -

victims wipe their tears yO

But you know this ts not true because Bullseye has
been blazing a trail of pain and death through this
country for a long time Why Simple because of
the money And more importantly for the pure
pleasure of killing

Bullseye grins almost proud of what hes hearing

DIANE
This man Bullseye is not “anti-social He is
evil He is a killer for pleasure and for money
Hes the garbage we must remove from mainstream

Where is the proof ladies and gentlemen Where is
the evidence Do you see it I dont see it
Because the truth is that there is no evidence my
client started the fire Daredevil the so-called Man
Without Fear spotted him more than a mile away from
the accident and attacked him for no reason For all
we know Daredevil could have very well provoked this
tragedy himself Not Mr Del Toro

Matt sitting again in the back row of the courtroom shakes his head in

disgust

Diane cannot take it

Objection Your Honor Mr Del Toro is on trial here
Not Daredevil

I am not accusing anybody I am just saying there is
absolutely no evidence my client planted that bomb

saw him do it

My dear So beautiful As always

Fisks behavior is most unusual He is extremely nice and seems to be a
close friend of the family

ON MATT He tries to focus on their conversation among the hundreds of
voices

Fisk takes a small box from his coat and offers it to Elektra

FISK
Please accept this small gift on this happy day

Elektra looks at Nikos He nods its okay to accept it She reaches for it
cana unfolds the wrapping Opens it

inside a file folder In the glow of a small lamp his face appears pale
Fisk stands calmly across from him smoking a cigarette through a long holder

FISK
Perhaps youll think the timing cruel in light of
the occasion But often I find its best to deal
with matters such as these when it is foremost in
ones mind just exactly how much one has to lose

NIKOS
I had no involvement with this The Natchios
Foundation is wholly non-profit Dedicated to good
works Your contributions were all earmarked for
charitable causes

FISK
And yet somehow theyve ended up in your private bank
account The paper trail is quite clear

Nikos lowers the papers eyeing Fisk with suspicion

NIKOS
Only you could come up with something this twisted

allow me to use your consulate and your diplomatic
channels as a safe route for my import-export
activities and become a partner in the growth of
Fisk Industries -- or part of another expanding
institution the prison system

Nikos is glaring at Fisk Thrusts a blunt finger at Fisks chest

NIKOS
Dont threaten me Your mistake Mister Fisk is
that you have maybe far the ‘first time in your life
come across someone wp cares less for the appearance
of honor than a ance

om Whatever that ‘langle ‘of verbiage is supposed to mean
I take it your answer is no

NIKOS
It is not merely no t is get out of my life and
never let your shadow cross my path again I will
have nothing to do with you or your dirty business

Fisk nods considering Lower lip jutting

FISK
Im asking myself if there is any way I can change
your mind Perhaps reminding you what Ive done for
Elektra Without me she wouldnt be here to
celebrate her birthday with you She probably
wouldnt even be celebrating a birthday

NIKOS
How long are you gonna hold this over my head
Havent you been compensated enough for what youve
done

enough to pay me back And I think you know that

He takes a RING BOX from his pocket Opens it Holds it out to her It
contains a ring featuring a MAMMOTH DIAMOND She averts her gaze from it

Softly

His face masking his anger and humiliation Fisk looks into the rear-view
mirror of the limo He meets the Asian eyes of the DRIVER and signals him

with a small nod Then Fisk pours Evian water into Elektras glass She
takes another sip

You remember Sugimoto your sensei

The driver turns around He is a lean dark intense-looking JAPANESE MAN
whose expression betrays no emotion He is KEN SUGIMOTO and he has played a
big role in Elektras life Now Elektra really feels lost She looks at
the glass realizing shes been drugged She tries to reach Fisk and slap
him but her hand is too heavy Its late too late to do anything The
glass falls to the floor Elektra closes her eyes losing consciousness
Fisk looks at her His beefy hand caressing her face

sics in a red vinyl booth working on a jumbo omelette Matt goes to sir
C across from him

MATT
(hopeless)
She said shes going away
FOGGY
She probably needs to be alone for a while Matt
MATT
(tormented)

She said Fisk saved her life Foggy There must be
something she never told me Something that strongly
ties her to Fisk And makes it hard for her to be
objective about him

FOGGY
I think I have finally an idea of what that could
be ‘

MATT eA f
What do you mean ‘AL ‘

‘
mY
Fisk has many canted Surely he has connectioris

in Japan aN Ye

C sogay pushes away his now enfoty plate and opens a big folder on the
table full of magazine and newspaper articles Mostly in Greek and
Japanese

FOGGY (CONTD)
Elektra was sixteen when she was kidnapped in a
public park in Tokyo Police found evidence it was a
Yakuza job the Japanese mafia

MATT
What evidence

FOGGY looks at the pictures of Elektra as a little girl and as a teenager on
the magazines

FOGGY
The bodyguard was instantly killed by a shuriken
dipped in curare A ninja weapon Yakuza use ninja
assassins only for very important missions Plus
no ransom was ever asked from the family

MATT
(curious)
Why would they kidnap her if not for the money
FOGGY 9
Well The Yakuza often act for pure revenge But
maybe in this case they just wanted to intimidate her
father Here comes the tricky part The girl is
gone for more than a year okay Nobody seems to
o have a clue Her mother dies of grief Then ta-
da By some miracle Elektra comes back Its
unclear how and why she was given back to her father
but this Greek article here mentions the name of
Wilson Fisk as the mediator between the Natchios
family and the kidnappers

Matt is pale He doesnt want to believe this but he knows its true

MATT
So maybe this was Fisks set up from the
beginning

FOGGY

Well of coursebut Mr Natchios never suspected
it In fact he moved to the States and became
Fisks friendly partner in several activities Only
recently did he return to the Diplomatic Corps

Tonio is sweating Absolutely terrified

TONIO
It was Mike Boss He said Murdock was gonna drown

you said and I shot at him several times And then
we locked him inside No chance he could have
survived

Fisk towers over Tonio like a human volcano ready to explode The goon is
scared to death Then Fisk puts his thumbs on Tonios face and starts to
massage him The goon catches his breath relieved

FISK
(very calm)
He was hopeless Tonio And a man without hopes is a
man without fear Thats why I told you to blow his
brains out

Now Fisk starts to squeeze His big fat thumbs slowly smashing the goons
face and skull Tonio’s CRIES are inhuman As is his pain Elektra turns
away while Sugimoto stares at the scene betraying no emotion Its finished

INT PENTHOUSE OFFICE NIGHT

Kingpin stands at the window watching the smoke from the Hells Kitchens
fire few blocks away His office is darkened and utterly quiet

He fishes two things from his desk a small REMOTE-CONTROL BOX and a
HANDGUN He slips the gun into his pocket He ACTIVATES the Hells Kitchen
MODEL with the remote Lights flash on Smoke trails from factory chimneys
MUSIC plays from a little TOY BAND in a TINY BISTRO

He smiles at it all with satisfaction

DAREDEVIL drops INTO VIEW outside the wigdow Swinging at the thick glass
He BANGS into it with both feet BN OTE Swings into it again ¢

Eyes burning

DAREDEVIL

Fisk circles the model toward him Caresses the top of the Hells Kitchen
portal with his hand

FISK
Why would anybody want to stop something so grand as
this Can you tell me that

DAREDEVIL
Its you who needs to be stopped

FISK
Oh but I wont be You see There are too many
people out there who think like I do You are ina
minority my friend You are a dying breed

DAREDEVIL
There are far more than you could ever know Fisk
Good decent honest hard-working men and women
But theyve been frightened Into inaction Into
on silence By people like you Because they have too
Much to lose Families Futures Loved ones
Lives oo

Daredevil slams his fist on the edge of the model causing the structures to
vibrate and lights to flicker

DAREDEVIL (contd)

o And the belief that good shall prevail and the meek

will inherit the earth and every good boy deserves
favor and virtue is its own reward and what goes
around comes around Well I guess even I still
believe that one And here it comes Cause I like
youam free I am unburdened Of those things
Those beliefs You took them away from me And now
you must deal with it

Fisk works the remote Speaks close into it and his VOICE EMANATES
life-like from somewhere to Daredevils right

FISK
(from hidden speakers)
That was very pretty

DD hesitates Thrown off Fisk circles him Turns a dial and speaks into
the remote again This time his VOICE EMANATES from the left

FISK 121
Do you like my sound system I had it custom made
with you in mind A good investment no Now that
youre back from the dead (beat) And Im glad you
are Because you owe me

Daredevil rallies himself to yell back at Fisk over the pain and confusion

DAREDEVIL
No You owe them All of them My father
Nikos They all died Because of you Nobody
else

Fisk sighs stepping to one side He puts on a strange pair of goggles then
pushes another button on the remote

FISK
No more debates

Dozens of slender light projectors come down from the ceiling each of them
inundating the room with a different color light RED WHITE GREEN YELLOW

is pulledthen SLAMMING home

ON DAREDEVIL Head turning minutely toward the beat and these sounds --

spins him around The walking cane flips through the air

DD hits the floor Comes up om one knee His senses searching madly in
every direction The MUSIC and SOUNDS still BLASTING The crazy 3-D RAINBOW
still sweeping the room DD rises to his feet Fighting through the din He

DD steps up onto a church and FLIPS through the air Fisk FIRES -- the
bullet LOPPING OFF the church spire

DD lands next to him and fires a spinning kick at Fisk The gun is knocked
out of his hand

The gun skitters across the floor and comes to a stop near the edge of the
wide open broken window

DAREDEVIL
You forget I know this part of town

Fisk fires a punch at him and Daredevil ducks -- Fisks massive fist
CRASHING into the side of an office building Sparks FLY and neon FLASHES
Fisk lets out a BELLOW Daredevil smashes head-first into his mid-section
and the two men CRASH through the model like King Kong versus Godzilla

vicious PUNCH across the face redevil goes flying

Fisk crawls from the model 1s himself to his feet and tramps across the

ward He plucks up Daredevifs cane

DD rises to his feet in the middle of the devastated city which glows madly
with eridless combinations of colors Smoky flames blaze infernally across
the ruined landscape Disoriented by the chaos of colors heat and noise DD
has lost Fisk

Fisk turns the cane over in his hands

FISK
How does this work Im referring to your cane by
the way With all your tricks I sometimes
forgetthat youre just a blind man

DD steps tentatively to the edge of the display Behind the sputtering
Hells Kitchen’ archway

Fisk eyes the cane curiously Points it at Daredevil Thumbs the button
The cane-top shoots spinning through the air

The handle glances hard off Daredevils head and he buckles The hook
clatters somewhere back among the model buildings

broken window buffets him

Fisk turns his face up to the water as he rises up with the gun He is
impervious DD is motionless Inert Beaten down Lost

The water washes the blood from the gash in his head

DAREDEVIL
FIIIIIIIISK You cant kill me Anymore

Fisk smiles at that Points the gun at his beaten quarry An easy shot
Water courses down Fisks fat gleaming face Over his shiny smiling lips
Spattering the SMALL ROSE pinned to his breast

forearm swiftly at the Hells fee AS Bway -- KNOCKING it from its i
moorings It flies across the floor idding over the slick wet surface
straight toward Fisk

Hes too big and slow to moye “nk its path -- he staggers back -- it
SWEEPS his feet out from und) him and soars out the open window behind him

(isk hits the ground on his belly and slides over the edge after it -- his
eyes white and wide One hand gripping the cane as he DROPS OUT OF SIGHT

Behind DD the unseen cane-hook GRAPPLES one of the models and the canes wire
goes taut at his feet THRUMMING

DD walks the length of the tight wire Drops pattering the floor Follows
it to the edge over which it disappears It slides back and forth against
the edge with a grating SCREECHING pulled by some great shifting weight
Daredevil steps to the edge The wind buffets him

Fisk hangs there clinging desperately with his sweating hand to the cane
dangling a hundred stories over the city

FISK
Please

He looks imploringly up at Daredevil

FISK
Pleasehelp me

Daredevils hand closes on the cane Slips down to the button Fisks brow
furrowing suspiciously Daredevils hand pauses there Fisk starts to shake
( his head
FISK
No Just pull me up

DD pauses for a second His finger poised over the button Fisk pleading
now desperate
FISK
Listen to me You dont want revenge Daredevil
An executioner No No You want justice
DD pauses for another second Then --

DAREDEVIL
Right I should forgive you Shouldnt I

DD leans down toward Fisk with a look on his face weve never seen before
Fierce Savage Cruel We really thinkshes gonna kill Fisk
