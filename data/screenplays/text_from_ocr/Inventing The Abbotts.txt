1EXT ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY ILLINOIS) - DAY
(LATE SPRING 1957)

OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
striped big-top style canvas tent INCLUDING The long
steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn
practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines the tall
center poles being leveraged upright the heavy rolled-up
sections of canvas being maneuvered into position and
ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
tent assumes its full and finished form

NEW ANGLE - TENT

-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion The
residence is on Main Street four blocks from where the
commercial district begins The mature over-arching
trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
promenade

2EXT ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY

JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
way to school Jacey is seventeen hes as handsome and
seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
rumpled and impulsive Doug is fifteen a popular
culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
affectations of whomever his hero is at the moment
(which presently happens to be Elvis Presley)

Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
on the Abbotts front yard (the installation of the tent
indicates that the Abbotts are having yet another of the
many parties they throw every year)

DOUG
Didnt get invited huh
JACEY
Go to hell
DOUG

Who cares Im not going and I
got invited

JACEY
Who invited you

party

JACEY

JACEY
Shut up

Jacey swats Dougs school books out from under his arm --
Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
interrupted by a CAR HORN They scurry out of the way as
LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
and cruises down the street Lloyd is a well-dressed-
and-fed man in his mid-forties A Midwestern burgher he
exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
pillars of this community Doug is embarrassed by
Lloyds passing but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal turns
and walks down the block

4INT HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)

ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker
Eleanor is sixteen outgoing sarcastic and very
popular She is the middle of the three Abbott
daughters Eleanor closes her locker turns and
discovers Jacey standing behind her He follows her down
the busy hall

JACEY
I tried to call you last night but
the line was busy

ELEANOR
No it wasnt

( )
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 32096 3

JACEY
It was busy all night
ELEANOR

ELEANOR

Well now you are But if youre

She gives him a sultry smile turns and glides into a
classroom as the BELL RINGS The corridor is quickly
vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
Eleanors smile

5 EXT HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)

ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
house in a working class neighborhood A home-made ping-
pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
that it forced the eviction of the family car a 1950
Plymouth coupe which is parked nearby on the driveway
The garage doors are open and the garage light is on

We hear (VO) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
Heartbreak Hotel in his best Elvis fashion
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 32096 3A4
INT HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR) 6

Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
coat and tie) still singing Heartbreak Hotel while he
carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
and a bottle of India ink Jaceys reflection appears in
the mirror behind Doug -- hes wearing a coat and tie too
Jacey does a pained take on Dougs handiwork

JACEY
Oh Christ

INT DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER) 7

HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table She was
grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
matter at hand She is an attractive but unostentatious
woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
than what she is a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
teenage sons on a school teachers salary (She teaches
second grade at Haley Elementary School)

JACEY
He has to wash it off Mother
You cannot let him go to the party
unless he washes it off

DOUG
Itll look worse if I wash it
Its India ink itll turn gray
itll look like dirt

JACEY
He looks like such a clown and he
doesnt even know it He doesnt
get how things work in this town
I thought you werent even going
to the party

DOUG
Changed my mind

HELEN
Doug you do understand that you
may be the only person at this
party with artificial sideburns

DOUG
Yeah

HELEN
You do understand that your
sideburns dont look real

Doug was hoping they didnt look that phony but he
conceals his disappointment and nods
( )
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 21696 5

DOUG
Yeah

HELEN
That they look really as though
youd drawn them on

DOUG
(swallows then
shrugs )
Yeah

She looks hard at Doug for a beat then turns to Jacey

HELEN
Well darling it seems he does
understand Why dont you just go
on to the party and ignore Doug
Just have a good time and pretend
you dont even

Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
door before his mother can finish her sermon

8EXT ABBOTT HOMETENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

The curb is lined with parked cars We hear a dance band
playing QUE SERA and the sounds of the party as Doug
lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
and smoking a cigarette He flicks the cigarette into
the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
up the long driveway towards the glowing big-top tent
Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbotts Cadillac
caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by

9INT ABBOTT HOMETENT - NIGHT

Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand

Despite his mothers advice a nauseated grimace falls
over Jaceys face when he sees that his younger brother
has arrived He is dancing with Eleanor

( )
Q9

They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
(Jaceys senior classmates) they are all edgy with envy
waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
Eleanor

ELEANOR
Im going out to the lake
tomorrow Sandy wants to show-off
her dads new boat Why dont you
come

JACEY
I have to work

ELEANOR
Well I guess youll just have to
write me a letter

JACEY
What do you mean

ELEANOR
You said you wanted to talk to me
in private

JACEY
I meant just we never get a
chance to be together alone you
know

STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor Jacey
handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner

INT ABBOTT HOMETENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG

-- sampling the hors doeuvres He places the ones he
doesnt like back onto the platter PAMELA ABBOTT steps
over to Doug She is his age (fifteen) the youngest of
the Abbott girls and the least stuck-up

PAMELA
Hi
u DOUG
Hi

She points at Dougs chest

PAMELA
Like your tie

( )

INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 21696

Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index
finger up across the tip of his nose Doug scowls and

points at her bust

DOUG
Can I borrow a Kleenex

PAMELA
Greaser

DOUG
(mouth full of
food)
Got any smokes around here

INT ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT

Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard
The tent can be seen in the bg The band is playing

MONA LISA

DOUG
So is this Peter guy Alice is
gonna marry rich

PAMELA
Of course Hes one of the Atlas
Steel Vanlaninghams Pittsburgh
Hes a bully

DOUG
So how come Alices marrying him

PAMELA
Because my parents want her to and
Alice is afraid of my parents
Its practically an arranged
marriage They think Alice has
peanut shells for brains or
something so they sort of
suggested that maybe it was time
to tie the old knot and they sort
of suggested that Peter was the
one to do it with

DOUG
Jeez no one can be that much of a
pushover

( )

INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 21696 8

PAMELA
Look Alice is the good daughter
Eleanor is the bad one and Im
the one who sort of gets off the
hook Thats just the way it
works Which one are you

DOUG
You mean which kind of brother am
I You got me The little
brother I guess

INT ABBOTT HOMETENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)

The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
wife JOAN ABBOTT step up onto the bandstand Joan has
the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
smile had been surgically sewn onto her face) She has a
tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
sleep a bit too little

LLOYD
Ladies and Gentlemen -- Id like
to propose a toast in honor of our
cause for celebration tonight --
the engagement of our daughter
Alice to Mister Peter
Vanlaningham

He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
VANLANINGHAM Alice is nineteen the eldest and the
prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
sisters Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
family He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
applause and AD-LIBBED toasts

The band strikes up I Got the World on a String and
Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
the dance floor

( )

The guests applaud their uninspired box-step neither
father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close
quarters

EXT ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY and TENT - NIGHT

The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the
tent and walks down the driveway Hes had enough of
high society for tonight

EXT SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT

Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
neighborhood) softly singing You Aint Nothin but a
Hound Dog He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb
strikes a wooden match and sets the trash on fire As
he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
several trash cans on fire in the near distance

EXT ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT
Eleanor necks with Steve (Jaceys rival) on the glider in
the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard The sounds
of the PARTY can be heard in the bg (the band is
playing In Old Monterey) Jacey stands in the shadows
of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache

EXT STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears

-- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb

EXT HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK and GARAGE - NIGHT

(MINUTES LATER)

As Jacey turns up the driveway a light snaps on in the
garage The garage doors are open Doug sits on the edge
of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
still on the light fixture pull chain

DOUG
Three out of five

JACEY
Two out of three You serve

Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
ping-pong They are expert players and fierce
competitors

EXT TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY

Lloyd Abbott pulls his Cadillac up to the pumps
The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey He wears a
Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap

JACEY

LLOYD

Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the
windshield Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash

climbs out of the car and empties the ashtray in the

trash can

JACEY

JACEY
Yes sir Eleanor invited me

LLOYD

JACEY
I want to be an architect

LLOYD
Hmmm I guess some people care
more about having ideas that they
do about making money

JACEY
I care about making money

Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that
enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash

LLOYD

That full suspension file drawer
your dad invented is still in
production did you know that
Well ship thirty-maybe-forty
thousand of those file cabinets
this year Hell that drawer put
Midwest Steel Desk on the map

JACEY

The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF Jacey hangs up the nozzle and

replaces the gas cap Lloyd pulls out his wallet

LLOYD

You want some free advice
JACEY

Sure
LLOYD

Dont waste your life making other
people rich Keep the change

He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car Lloyd
drives away in his Cadillac Jacey crumbles the five
dollar bill into a ball As he returns to the office he
catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette
machine He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie

INT BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY

The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
situated on an isolated shore of the large lake Doug
strikes a wooden match shepherds the flame leans over
holds the match to his ass and lights a fart The
amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly
disappears as the gas is consumed VICTOR Dougs
partner in crime and best friend is impressed (Victor
is fifteen too)

VICTOR

Jeez Louise Howd you do that
DOUG

Intestinal gas -- produced by

bacterial metabolism of food
residues in the colon A mixture
of oxygen hydrogen carbon
dioxide and methane Thats the
secret ingredient

VICTOR
Whats so secret about it

DOUG
Not everyone can produce methane
Its genetic that means its
inherited Theres a lot of
methane in my family

Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and
sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a
male water skier (Another young man is driving the boat
with two young women in bathing suits as passengers )

dock

As they pass a ski ramp Steve points to it Jacey gives
him a thumbs up gesture and Steve circles the boat

around for the approach

SANDY
No way Hes never done the ramp

STEVE
He wants to do it

Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open

Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over
the wake

Eleanor leans over to Steve

ELEANOR
You know youre going too fast

STEVE
(grins)
Yeah I know

The boat zips by the ramp and Jaceys skis contact the
slippery surface and his skis go out from under him He
takes a hard bounce loses hold of the tow-rope and goes
tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water

coolly returns his stare Doug tries but hes unable to

I didnt say she was stupid
Lloyds pretty smooth Thats why

needed the money

What money We never had any
money Money had nothing to do

hangs back leaning against the Plymouths fender

INT HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY (SPRING 1958) 38

Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his
book She is seated across the table from him The
library is filled with students poring over their
assignments Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Dougs
probing eyes

Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table
He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanors skirt at the
soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
parted legs Eleanors hand lowers a piece of notebook
paper beneath the table on it she has written Hi
Doug

Doug starts with panic rears back cracks his head on
the bottom of the table and then as his head rebounds
from the blow he accidentally impales himself in his
chin with the sharp pencil Doug scrambles up from under
the table with the pencil dangling from his chin
knocking over his chair in the process The tranquility
of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
reactions of the students Eleanor is momentarily
concerned about his welfare but she cannot help but
laugh too

39 EXT STREETS OF HALEY - LATER THAT DAY 39

Doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home
from school He sports a Band-aid on his chin Pamela

PAMELA
Both

Doug exhales with bewilderment stubs out his cigarette
then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela She holds
perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
and kisses her Then he concludes the kiss to check her
reaction she timidly smiles He kisses her again with
greater fervor Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
massages her breast Pamela struggles to suppress her
surprise which he mistakes as a sign of her approval
Emboldened by her lack of resistance he slips his hand
under her bra Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
sensation then alarmed by the pace of their passion

PAMELA
Doug

Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a
framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of
family photos on the long table behind the sofa It is
Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his minds eye it is
Eleanors breast that he is fondling Pamela pulls her
lips from his

PAMELA
Do you love me Doug Do you

He kisses her with such ardor that she interprets his
answer to be yes when in reality Doug is only trying to
silence her He pulls his hand out of her blouse and
slips it under her skirt Pam lurches back into the
sofa

PAMELA
Jesus

He tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away

PAMELA
Stop it stop it

She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa Doug looks
at her with breathless confusion She turns away from
him and tries to button her blouse but she cant see the
buttons for her tears She begins to sob and runs out of
the room

his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway Pams
disappointment is plain to see

Doug doesnt notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends
approaching in the opposite direction As they pass him
Eleanor smiles brightly and says

ELEANOR

INT HOLT DINING ROOM AND FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61

Doug spies on Joan and Helen and their curious exchange
through a dining room window Unable to hear their words
he can only witness how their words are spoken

EXT HOLT HOME - DOUGS POV 62

Helen steps off the porch and approaches Joan who is
doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a
certain distance from Helen and works her way to her
Chrysler Town and Country station wagon parked at the curb
Joan grows more and more agitated as she talks

INT HOLT HOME - ENTRYWAY 63

Eager to hear what is being said Doug dashes through the

EXT STREET - HOLT HOME - DAY

Joan has the drivers door to her station wagon open now

Helen is on the sidewalk Her demeanor is measured
purposefully matter-of-fact

HELEN
I dont think thats necessary

JOAN
Well if I were you I would talk
to him and tell him

HELEN
(cutting her off)
No Im sorry Joan I will not do
that If you have something to
say to my son then youll have to
say it to him yourself

JOAN
I just thought you would like to
know what hes done

HELEN
And why on earth should I believe
anything you say Joan

Joan is unable to find a quick retort she gets into her
station wagon and drives away

Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter she picks
it up and cleans it off with her apron As she turns to
go back to the house she finds Doug standing on the
porch steps Without warning she expertly pitches the
baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand
sting when he catches it Helen walks up to the porch

HELEN
Im going to ask you one question
Doug and if you have no idea or
dont want to answer just tell
me

DOUG
Okay

HELEN
Is there any sense you think in
which Jacey has oh I dont
know it sounds ridiculous
corrupted Eleanor Abbott Led her
astray

Dougs mind works in several directions at once as he
tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her

( )

INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 32096 36

DOUG
Well jeez I know that
hes that hes slept with her
But not because hes talked about
it I mean Eleanor has lots of
boyfriends I think Jacey likes
her more than she likes him

HELEN
(long beat)
I see
(another beat)
Go finish your homework

Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside

Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
Joans visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
bone-weary sadness falls over her Her tranquility is
not borne of happiness it is only a means of coping with
the sadness that is at the core of her being

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)

A drab four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license
plates speeds away from town

Incongruously the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by

WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott There is nothing telling about
Eleanors countenance neither happiness nor sadness can
be found on her face

JACEY
Eleanor was just looking for a way

Its not enough that you sleep
around with boys from your world

wrong side of the tracks

INT ABBOTT HOME - TENT - NIGHT

The party is well underway its a younger crowd tonight
The band plays Fly Me To The Moon Doug stands apart
from the others Hes ill-at-ease His conversation
with Jacey resonates within him As he looks over the
gathering hes pained to discover how easy it is to see
things the way Jacey does Lloyd holding court with a
group of men in tuxedos Joan Abbott propelling a
reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alices age
(Alice and Peter have separated) and finally Pamela
dancing with a handsome young man (TED) She is the
belle of the ball radiant and suddenly mature in her
beautiful gown She smiles as she sees Doug excuses
herself and comes over to him

PAMELA
How long have you been here
DOUG
A while
PAMELA
Are you okay
DOUG

PAMELA
Youre sorry for feeling me up

DOUG
(embarrassed)
Oh shit come on Pam Dammit
For crying out loud Forget it

PAMELA
I accept your apology Lets
dance

Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor He
feels like a dolt but she arranges his hands on her and
they begin to dance She gazes into his eyes and smiles

PAMELA
Hi

DOUG
Hi

Pam is in love with Doug she has been since they were
children Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
her For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
of true affinity But their bubble begins to deflate as
Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them Her disapproval
is unmistakable Doug steers Pam around the dance floor
to avoid Joans eyes but then he sees Lloyd Abbott
Lloyds stare is even more discomforting Pamela senses
the change in Dougs mood but she is unaware of the
cause

PAMELA
Is Jacey home for the summer or is
he just here for a visit

The mention of his brothers name at this exact moment
sends a chill down Dougs spine

( )

INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev 21696 42

Its cheaper if he stays here for

money for school ‘cause he

Youre not poor are you

DOUG
Hell -- you kidding Even with
Jacey working summers my mom had

Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his
dance with Pamela Dougs bitterness swells

DOUG

Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder

DOUG
Fuck off

Ted is taken aback Pamelas eyes fill with tears

PAMELA
Why do you hate me so much

TED
Excuse me asshole but

Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him
reeling into the other dancers Everyone pulls away from
Doug and Pam Doug massages his fist and looks
helplessly at Pamela

DOUG

Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter
Jacey smiles puts his paddle down and walks out of the
garage Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
it into the back of Jaceys head Jacey turns and shoots

a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles

girls are in high spirits as they get into Pams car

Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
onto the sidewalk

HELEN
Hello Muriel Doris

The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve Helen is
seemingly unruffled by their distant responses She
observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive
off

Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELD - GYMNASIUM - DAY 76

The commencement exercises are being held in the
sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud
parents and family members Doug hot and uncomfortable
in his cap and gown is seated among his fellow graduates
behind the podium The PRINCIPAL (at the podium)
announces the names of the graduates as he calls them
forward to receive their diplomas

PRINCIPAL
Pamela Louise Abbott

Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma

Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter Joan
stands to take a snapshot Alice is occupied with her
restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter Susan

Doug watches Pam return to her seat she avoids his eyes

Helen is all smiles this is a very special day for her
The chair next to her is empty She glances behind her
and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym

Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom
He is only there at his mothers insistence His eyes
settle on Alice Abbott

Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old
daughter (SUSAN) Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle

Jaceys eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she
passes by with Susan in her arms

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY 77

Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars
slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating
graduates beaming parents and rambunctious siblings

As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly
ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers She
has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on

Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as
they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between
two parked vehicles They are both caught off-guard --
there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each
other

LLOYD

They pass each other and head their separate ways Their
chance meeting has not gone unobserved

Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of
Lloyds brand-new 1959 Cadillac She pretends to repair
her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips
behind the wheel

And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her He opens the door
so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in
the back seat) Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around
the car and gets in behind the wheel

Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jaceys glare)
and pulls out of his parking spot

by A party for the Class of 1959 is underway (as a
banner on the tent proclaims) The street is lined with
parked cars and busy with late-coming guests

Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jaceys reaction but

DOUG

Pamela takes his hand gently unfolds it and with her
index finger she writes on his palm I love you

HELEN (CONTD)
Jacey was almost two and I was
eight months pregnant with you
and well some mornings Id be
crying before I even woke up
Then you were born And Jacey
just got lost in there I didnt
have anything for him Mother
took him over Hed cry or call
for me and then Id hear Mother
answer him and Id go back to
sleep

(sighs bitterly)

I shouldve taken us away from
here gone somewhere else

DOUG
Why

HELEN
After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott
started dropping by on his way
home from work He felt so bad
about that bet Charlie made with
him at the lake That foolish
idiotic bet Poor Lloyd -- I felt
sorry for him Hed have a cup of
coffee with Mother and me Ifa
doorknob had come off hed fix it
Hed carry the garbage cans to the
curb Someone dies people try to
be helpful But he was by here so
often that people started to talk
It was fairly obvious that he
wanted something more from me than
just a cup of coffee I suggested
that he didnt need to stop by
here so often but then one
afternoon I was at Woolworths
having lunch at the counter All
of sudden Joan Abbott was standing
there -- screaming and yelling at
me to stop sleeping with her
husband with Lloyd I was
speechless She was gone before I
could find my tongue

talk to her to put her mind at
ease but

DOUG

that nothing had happened

HELEN
Im sure he did but men always
say that darling Besides Lloyd
was always having affairs Hes
that type of man

DOUG
Ahhh Jesus but why Why did
everyone in town believe Joan
Abbott

HELEN
Because shes Joan Abbott If you
cross Joan you dont get invited
to her parties -- and the Abbotts
have the best parties in town
The only parties

DOUG
I hate this town I hate the
Abbotts

He slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over

drive out on that ice She never
did anything but try to make me
hurt less and I

idea and I never meant your mother
any harm I wouldve done
anything for her -- anything I
