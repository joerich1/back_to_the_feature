ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN
by
William Goldman
Based on the novel
All The Presidents Men
by
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward

Pre-rehearsal version March 1975

Start with as few credits as possible When theyre over--
FADE IN ON
A TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE

We see it in the center of the large dimly lit screen As
the tape is pressed around a door--

BEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE

Its a major piece of action running maybe five minutes and
its all as detailed and accurate as we can make it with as
many if onlys included as possible (If only the tape
ad been attached up and down instead of around the door
Wills wouldnt have spotted it and alerted the police if
only the first police car called had gone to investigate
Baldwin watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn would
ave seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time
for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely
away)

The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men He thought
e only had one guy so when ten hands were raised he was
surprised The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber
surgical gloves HOLD on the hands a moment then--

A DARK APARTMENT

The phone rings WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver turns on
the bed light He listens a moment

WOODWARD
No no trouble Harry be right down
(he hangs up)
Son of a bitch
He lies back The apartment is one room a small terrace
beyond Not much of a place

WOODWARD lies still staring at the ceiling He blinks blinks
again HOLD

CUT TO
THE ENORMOUS FIFTH FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST

It looks early of a Saturday morning pretty deserted Those
reporters that are around are young bright and presently
involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and
thumbing through the papers

HARRY ROSENFELD surveys the scene from his office doorway as
WOODWARD approaches hangs his coat at his desk not far
from where ROSENFELD is standing

ROSENFELD
Wheres that cheery face weve come
to know and love

WOODWARD
You call me in on my day off because
some idiots have broken into local
Democratic Headquarters--tell me
Harry why should I be smiling

ROSENFELD

As usual that keen mind of yours
has pegged the situation perfectly

(chomps on some Maalox

tablets)
Except (a) it wasnt local Democratic
Headquarters it was National
Democratic Headquarters--

(WOODWARD is surprised--

he hadnt known)
--and (b) these werent just any
idiots these were special idiots
seeing as when they were arrested at
230 this morning they were all
wearing business suits and Playtex
gloves and were carrying--

(consults a piece of

paper)
--a walkie-talkie forty rolls of
film cameras lock picks pen-sized
tear gas guns plus various bugging
devices

(puts paper down)
Not to mention over two thousand
dollars mostly in sequenced hundred
dollar bills

WOODWARD
Preliminary hearing at Superior

Courthouse
ROSENFELD
(nods)
Two oclock work the phones til
you go

THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING

WOODWARD hurries along goes inside as we

CUT TO

CUT TO

A CORRIDOR INSIDE WOODWARD comes down it looks around
sees a door marked Counsels Offices and heads toward it

Now--

A CLERK AT A DESK as WOODWARD comes up Behind them

CUT TO

two

lawyers are clearly angry about something talking and

gesticulating to each other

WOODWARD
(to the COUNSELS
CLERK)
Could you give me the names of the
lawyers for the men arrested in the
Watergate

CLERK
These two were appointed--
(indicates the angry
men)
--only now it turns out the burglars
got their own counsel
(he starts to laugh)

FIRST ANGRY LAWYER
(to CLERK)
When you gonna stop thinking its so
funny

SECOND ANGRY LAWYER
(To CLERK)
We wouldda done a terrific job
protecting those guys
(neither lawyer by
the way is Clarence
Darrow)

FIRST ANGRY LAWYER
You think were not as good as some
hotshot fancy lawyer--
CUT TO

THE COURTROOM and business is booming Muggers pimp hookers
their families and friends In the scene that follows a
constant counterpoint is whats going on up at the front as
an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous
night the aforementioned muggers pimps and hookers are
shuttled in given a quick appearance before a JUDGE who

sets bond and then shuttled out

In the audience one man stands out--DOUGLAS CADDY He is
extremely well-dressed and obviously successful Beside him
sits another smaller man who is unshaven and squints
WOODWARD moves in sits alongside CADDY

WOODWARD
Mr Caddy My names Bob Woodward
Im from the Post and I wanted to
ask about how you happened to come
on this case--

CADDY
--Im not here

WOODWARD
(nods)
OK

He takes out a small notebook writes muttering aloud as he
does

WOODWARD
Douglas Caddy the attorney of record
when questioned about his presence
in the courtroom denied he was in
the courtroom Im not here Mr
Caddy said

CADDY

(impatiently)
Clearly I am here but only as an
individual Im not the attorney of
record

(indicating unshaven

man)
Mr Rafferty has that position
Whatever you want youll have to
get from him I have nothing more to
say

And as he gets up walks off--
CUT TO

THE WATER FOUNTAIN IN THE CORRIDOR There is a small line
CADDY waits at the end of it
WOODWARD
(moving in behind him)
Mr Rafferty was very helpful Four
Cuban-Americans and this other man
James McCord

CADDY
Look I told you inside--

WOODWARD
--you have nothing more to say I
understand that

CADDY turns away WOODWARD goes right on

WOODWARD
What I dont understand is how you
got here

CADDY

I assure you theres nothing
mysterious involved

WOODWARD
Probably youre right but a little
while ago I was talking to a couple
of lawyers whod been assigned to
represent the burglars

CADDY
So

WOODWARD

Well they never would have been
assigned if anyone had known the
burglars had arranged for their own
counsel And that could only mean
the burglars didnt arrange for their
own counsel--they never even made a
phone call

(looks at CADDY)
So if they didnt ask for you to be
here how did you know to come

Without a word CADDY turns leaves the line without getting
a drink Silently WOODWARD watches Now--

CUT TO

CADDY seated as before beside RAFFERTY WOODWARDs voice
come from behind him and as CADDY turns WOODWARD is seated
one row back

WOODWARD
Did you know to come because one of
the other men involved in the break-
in called you

CADDY
(turning)
There is no reason to assume other
people were involved

WOODWARD
Your clients were arrested with a
walkie-talkie they didnt need that
to talk among themselves

CADDY looks at WOODWARD turns back

CADDY
(turning back
They are not my clients

WOODWARD
Youre a lawyer and youre here--

CADDY
--I met one of the defendants Mr
Barker at a social occasion once--
(stops himself)
--I have nothing more to say

WOODWARD

(leaning forward as

CADDY turns away

again)
A Miami social occasion

(explaining)
Mr Rafferty told me the Cubans were
from Miami

CADDY
(sighing)
Barkers wife called me at three
this morning her husband apparently
had told her to call if he hadnt
called her by then

WOODWARD
It was really nice of you to come
since youd only met him once

CADDY
Are you implying you dont believe
me

WOODWARD

I have nothing more to say

CADDY
You dont mind getting on peoples
nerves do you
WOODWARD considers this a moment Then--

WOODWARD
Nope

And on that word--
CUT TO

THE COURTROOM as without warning it quiets There is suddenly
a tremendous air of expectancy you can feel it Now we see
why as five men in dark business suits are led in theyve
been stripped of belts ties and shoelaces McCord is taller
than the others They stand facing the JUDGE backs to the
audience

WOODWARD sits watching as the proceedings start but its
hard to hear He concentrates as the JUDGE starts speaking

JUDGE
Will you please state your
professions

The five men do not move or reply Then after a long pause
Barker says--â€”

BARKER
Anti-Communists

JUDGE
Anti-Communists
(perplexed)
That sir is not your average

occupation

WOODWARD starts moving forward now down an aisle moving
past kids and whores and all the rest trying to hear what
the hells going on At the front of the spectators section
is a fence-like wooden barricade about three feet high As
he approaches it--

The JUDGE indicates the bald burglar

JUDGE
Your name please

MCCORD
James McCord

JUDGE
Will you step forward sir
(MCCORD obeys)

WOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward trying to hear but
its hard
JUDGE
And what is your occupation Mr
McCord

MCCORD
(softly)
Security consultant

JUDGE
Where

MCCORD
(softer)
Government Recently retired

JUDGE
Where in government

MCCORD
(we cant really make
this out)
Central Intelligence
Agency

JUDGE
(he cant either)
Where
MCCORD
(clearing his throat)
The CIA
And on these words
ZOOM TO
CLOSE UP--WOODWARD leaning over the fence practically falling
over it in a desperate straining effort to catch whats going

on

WOODWARD
(stunned)
Holy shit
Now from the courtroom--
CUT TO

THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WASHINGTON POSTS
We are at the end of the press run the papers are all
assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various
places As the papers continue to roll past--

A UNION TYPE EMPLOYEE grabs a paper looks at the front page

The Watergate story headlined whatever it was headlined is
visible The byline was by Alfred E Lewis The union type
Post employee glances at the article--

UNION POST EMPLOYEE
(reading half-aloud)
Five men one of whom said he is a
former employee
(stops reading gives
a shrug)
Schmucks

And he turns happily to the sports section--
CUT TO

A CLOSE UP OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS

Its new money and looks as if its been recently ironed
Someone is going through the cash making a quick count
During this--

FIRST VOICE (VO)
Hurry it huh Bachinski

BACHINSKI
You said I could look at it--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Were in a room in a police station and two men are present
One a COP is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the
door The other BACHINSKI is taking hurried notes ina
reporters type notebook as he examines the evidence

COP
--I said look not memorize--

BACHINSKI
--almost done give it a rest all
right
(and he looks at an
address book he
stops)

CUT TO

THE ADDRESS BOOK Beside the name Howard E Hunt is the
notation WHouse Now BACHINSKI hurriedly opens the other
book to the letter H and there is the same name Howard
E Hunt and beside it the letters WH

COP (V0O)
Whatd you find

BACHINSKI (VO)
Beats me These notebooks belonged
to Cuban guys
COP (V0O)
Stright

BACHINSKI (VO)
Its gotta mean either White House
or whore house one or the other

We HOLD on the HUNT name and the address notations Then--
CUT TO

WOODWARDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

The phone rings waking him He fumbles for the phone and
the light finally gets them both

WOODWARD
Bachinski
(reaches for a notebook)
What--hold it--
(gets it open starts
to write)
--OK go on go on

CUT TO
A BOX OF MAALOX TABLETS

ROSENFELD is opening them were in his office WOODWARD
sits across the desk holding the notebook we saw him writing
in

ROSENFELD
GO on go on

WOODWARD
Thats everything Bachinski had I
think its worth following up

ROSENFELD
Dont know who the hells Howard
Hunt
(crunches tablets)
Its probably nothing but check it
out Just go easy it could be crazy
Cubans

HOWARD SIMONS sticks his head in the office

SIMONS
Anything

ROSENFELD
Woodwards onto a new wrinkle with
the break-in thing--absolute page
one stuff--
He moves on

SIMONS
--in other words you got nothing
youre thumbsucking

ROSENFELD
(shrugs)
Could develop

SIMONS

Let me see what you get but dont
jump--The New York Times thinks its
crazy Cubans

ROSENFELD
OK get on this WHouse guy and do a
better job then you did on McCord

WOODWARD
I did all right on McCord

ROSENFELD
Then how come the Associated Press
were the ones found out that Mr
McCord is security coordinator for
the Committee to Re-elect the
President otherwise known as CREEP

WOODWARD
(getting it straight)
The head of security for the
reelection of a Republican President
got caught bugging the national
offices of the Democrats What the
hell does that mean

ROSENFELD

(hasnt the foggiest)
Mr John Mitchell the head of CREEP
says it means nothing

(reads)
This man and the other people
involved were not operating on either
our behalf or with our consent These
is no place in our campaign or in
the electoral process for this type
of activity and we will not forget
it or condone it

WOODWARD
(getting up)
You cant believe that

ROSENFELD
As a rough rule of thumb as far as

ROSENFELD turns quickly to WOODWARD
I can throw Bronco Nagurski thats
how much I trust John Mitchell

Now--

CUT TO
A MOON-FACED MAN RINGING A TRIANGLE

CUT TO
THE NEWSROOM as the triangle sound echoes

HOWARD SIMONS leaves large Managing Editors office walks
past another office knocks twice on the glass wall

Inside the Executive Editors office BEN BRADLEE sits As
SIMONS knocks he turns nods He appears for the moment
deep in thought

HARRY ROSENFELD on the opposite end of the room hurries out
of his office following a bunch of editors all of them
heading across the huge room As he passes WOODWARDs desk
ROSENFELD pauses

ROSENFELD
Whatd you get on WHouse

WOODWARD
(massaging his neck
Lotsa hints--

ROSENFELD
(not happy)
I cant sell hints to Simons--
(stops looks at piece
of yellow paper)
--you called everyone you know
(WOODWARD makes a nod)
Call someone you dont know

WOODWARD continues to rub his neck as ROSENFELD hurries off
all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon-
faced man intermittently rings the triangle

WOODWARD picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk
Lined legal-sized it is crammed with names and numbers and
addresses They are in no neat order looking at them its
almost like following a path chicken tracks in ink WOODWARD
mutters to hell with it and reaches for a thick book flips
it open

NOW WE SEE THE BOOK Its the Washington Phone Directory and
were in the Ws As WOODWARDs finger stops we can see
hes looking at the White HOuse entry number There it is
just like your name and mine Listed
Now WOODWARD starts to dial visibly nervous a fact he tries
very hard to keep out of his voice tone

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (VO)
White House

WOODWARD
(casually)
Howard Hunt please

Throughout the following call we stay on WOODWARDs face
hear the other voices

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (VO)
Mr Hunt does not answer

WOODWARD is delighted hes even there

WOODWARD
Thanks anyway--

And hes about to hang up when--

WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR (VO)

WOODWARD
(a little more excited)

SECRETARY (V0O)

SECRETARY (V0O)

Public Relations He works at Mullen
and Company Public Relations as a
writer The number is 555-1313 Im
sorry I couldnt be more helpful

WOODWARD
Listen forget it

He hangs up sits there His hands are a little twitchy
HOLD Now--

CUT TO
ROSENFELD hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office
WOODWARD looking for something in his desk throughout this
scene speaks to him

WOODWARD

WOODWARD
Whos Charles Colson

ROSENFELD

(stops dead)
I would liken your query to being in
Russia half a century ago and asking
someone I understand who Lenin is
and Trotsky I got too but whos
this yokel Stalin

WOODWARD
Whos Colson Harry

ROSENFELD
The most powerful man in America is
President Nixon probably youve
heard his name

unfazed by anything continues to open drawers
close them as ROSENFELD rolls on

ROSENFELD
The second most powerful man is Robert
Haldeman Just below him are a trio
Mr Erlichman is Haldemans friend
and they protect the President from
everybody which is why they are
referred to as either The German
Shepherds or the Berlin Wall Mr
Mitchell weve already discussed
Mr Colson is the Presidents special
counsel

WOODWARD
rising)

Thanks Harry

ooks at ROSENFELD)
Know anything about Colson

ROSENFELD
Just that on his office wall theres
a cartoon with a caption reading
When youve got them by the balls
their hearts and minds will follow

WOODWARD nods heads back toward the files as we

WOODWARD AT HIS DESK dialing the phone

Hes got the Colson file spread out now and we see

CUT TO

pictures
of the man and articles the Post had done on him But
basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn
phone and youd think his finger would fall off from all the
dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage

goes on you can hear it grow raspy But a lot of what a
reporter does he does on the phone and thats what were
compressing here The dialing never stops the voices are
continuous

WOODWARD
Hello Im Bob Woodward of the Washing
Post and
(beat)

Mullen and Company Public Relations
Could you tell me when you expect
Mr Hunt

(surprised)
He is

HUNT (VO)
Howard Hunt here

WOODWARD
Hi Im Bob Woodward of the Post and--

HUNT (VO)
(impatient)
--yes yes what is it

WOODWARD
I was just kind of wondering why
your name and phone number were in
the address books of two of the men
arrested at Watergate

HUNT (VO)
(blind panic)
Good God

And he bangs the phone down sharply--
--more dialing SOUNDS Now snatches of conversation--

WOODWARD
Im sorry to bother you Mr Bennett
but were doing some investigating
of one of your employees Howard
Hunt

BENNETT (VO)
Well if youve been doing some
investigating then obviously its no
secret to you that Howard was with
the CIA

WOODWARD
(he hadnt known)
No secret at all
More dialing Then--

WOODWARD
(tired voice deeper)
Hello CIA This is RW Woodward
of the Washington Post--get me
Personnel--

Dialing again WOODWARDs voice is showing genuine fatigue

WOODWARD
Hi Im Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post--and--whats that--youve never
heard of me--I cant help that--you
dont believe Im with the Post--
what do you want me to do Madam
shout extra--extra

There is the SOUND of the phone being slammed down in his
ear Hard Now--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD AND SIMONS approaching WOODWARD who is working at
his desk He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it

ROSENFELD
Whaddya got whaddya got

WOODWARD
Hunt is Colsons man--

(to SIMONS explaining)
--thats Charles Colson Nixons
special counsel--

(SIMONS almost says

something decides

against it)

--they both went to Brown University--

(consulting his notes)

--Hunt worked for the CIA till
70 and this is on deep background
the FBI thinks hes involved with
the break-in

SIMONS
What else have you got

WOODWARD
According to White House personnel
Hunt definitely works there as a
consultant for Colson But when I
called the White House Press office
they said he hadnt worked there for
three months Then the PR guy said
the weirdest thing to me
(reading)
IT am convinced that neither Mr
Colson nor anyone else at the White
House had any knowledge of or
participation in this deplorable
incident at the Democratic National
Committee

He looks up at them

SIMONS
Isnt that what youd expect them to
say
WOODWARD
Absolutely
ROSENFELD
So
WOODWARD

(hes got something

and he knows it)
I never asked them about Watergate
I only said what were Hunts duties
at the White House They volunteered
that he was innocent when nobody
asked was he guilty

ROSENFELD
(to SIMONS)
I think we got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging

SIMONS
(nods)

Just be careful how you write it

CUT TO

WOODWARD TYPING LIKE MAD makes a mistake corrects it types
on muttering to himself and--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE munching a handful of Maalox tablets
and--

CUT TO

WOODWARD taking a sheet from his typewriter hurrying off
and--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD taking the sheet from WOODWARD--
WOODWARD

ROSENFELD nods shows him out and--
CUT TO

WOODWARD BACK AT HIS MACHINE typing faster then before makes
another mistake starts to correct it glances around and--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE gesturing to somebody but not WOODWARD

CUT TO
WOODWARD watching as BERNSTEIN appears in view from behind
the wide pillar by WOODWARDs desk heads toward ROSENFELDs
office WOODWARD shrugs goes back to his typing makes a
typo immediately glances over toward ROSENFELDs office
freezes as we--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD handing some papers to BERNSTEIN They look from
this distance suspiciously like WOODWARDs story

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN hurrying out of ROSENFELDs office and--

CUT TO
WOODWARD watching BERNSTEIN until he disappears out of sight
behind the pillar WOODWARD hesitates finally goes back to
his typing makes another mistake fixes it makes still

CUT TO

ROSENFELD as WOODWARD hands him another sheet of paper

WOODWARD
This is all of it Harry

ROSENFELD NODS takes it immediately starts to read as we--

nods takes it walks back toward his desk disappears behind
the pillar again WOODWARD is starting to steam Now--

CUT TO

BERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK typing magnificently his hands rising
and falling like Rubinsteins Behind him is the pillar and
for a moment there is nothing--then very slowly a figure
peers out from behind the pillar--it is WOODWARD

He watches BERNSTEIN continues to type then after a moment
rests thinks shifts around in his chair and as his glance
starts toward the pillar--

CUT TO
THE PILLAR WOODWARD is gone

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN typing madly away

THE PILLAR WOODWARD is visible again eyes very bright
now-â€”

CUT TO

BERNSTEIN finishing typing his hands moving majestically
WOODWARD comes up behind him stands looking a second

Then--

WOODWARD
We have to talk

BERNSTEIN nods grabs the papers both that hes been typing
and that hes been copying from

And as he rises--
PAN TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking silently out of the newsroom
then turning left down a darker corridor passing bulletin
boards and wall lockers and its all nice and quiet as they
amble on nodding to the few people they pass on their way
and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge
which is empty the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell
reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are
visible selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and
there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they
are alone the silence ends

WOODWARD
What the hell were you doing rewriting
my story--
BERNSTEIN
--I sure couldnt hurt it could I--

WOODWARD
--it was fine the way it was--

BERNSTEIN
--it was bullshit the way it was--

WOODWARD
--I have to stand here and listen to
the staff correspondent from Virginia--

BERNSTEIN

(a sore subject)
--what have you been here nine
months--I been in this business

since I was sixteen--

WOODWARD
--and youve had some fucking meteoric
rise thats for sure--by the time
you turn forty you might be the head
of the Montana bureau--

BERNSTEIN
--you only got the job because both
you and Bradlee went to Yale--

WOODWARD
--Bradlee went to Harvard--

BERNSTEIN
--theyre all the same all those
Ivy League places--they teach you
about striped ties and suddenly youre
smart-â€”

WOODWARD
--Im smart enough to know my story
was solid--

BERNSTEIN
--mines better--

WOODWARD
--no way--

BERNSTEIN
(handing them over)
--read em both and youll see--
And as WOODWARD glances at the two stories--â€”

Cur

BERNSTEIN watching Now--
CUT TO

WOODWARD He glances from one story to the other Then
disconsolately--

WOODWARD
crap

And he sinks down in a chair

BERNSTEIN
Is mine better

WOODWARD nods

WOODWARD
(handing the stories
back)
What is it about my writing thats
so rotten

BERNSTEIN
(as he exits)
Mainly it has to do with your choice
of words

And as he goes leaving WOODWARD just sitting there--
CUT TO

BERSTEIN re-entering the newsroom returning to his desk
He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter
hesitates lights a cigarette He inhales as behind him
WOODWARD briefly is visible going to his desk behind the
pillar

Finally BERNSTEIN inserts the paper starts to type as
WOODWARD (VO)
(from behind the pillar)
Carl
BERNSTEIN
(turns)
Yeah
WOODWARD
(pushing his chair
briefly into view)
Fuck you Carl
And as he rolls forward again out of sight--

CUT TO

RICHARD NIXON ON THE TUBE
(Its the June 22 Press Conference) He talks on about

something it doesnt matter exactly what here the point
is it should include that strange smile of his that kept
appearing when the man should not have been smiling Hints
of pressure maybe thats all and once its established--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WOODWARD sitting alone gloomily staring at the set Were
in the Post Cafeteria its the next morning and the place
is pretty much empty He sips the coffee it tastes rotten
BERNSTEIN moves up behind him carrying a cup of coffee of
his own He stands by WOODWARD briefly

BERNSTEIN

You heard

(WOODWARD glances up)
They put us both on the break-in
thing Simons liked the way we worked
together

(WOODWARD nods

BERNSTEIN sits down)
Listen Im sorry I said your story

failure

BERNSTEIN
Forget it the main thing--
(stops)
--did you call me a failure

WOODWARD

CUT TO

WOODWARD BERNSTEIN AND NIXON The way its shot its almost
as if theyre watching each other NIXON staring out from

the TV set answering questions WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sip
coffee We dont know yet--or better they dont know it

yet but these are our adversaries

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN without NIXON now They sit at the
table Occasionally NIXON is audible in the background

WOODWARD
All right what do we know

BERNSTEIN
Let me lay a little theory on you--
WOODWARD
(cutting him off
--Im not interested in theory What
do we know For example Hunts
disappeared

BERNSTEIN
Well Barker tried to get blueprints
of the Miami Convention Center and
the air-conditioning system

WOODWARD

And McCord was carrying an application
for college press credentials for

the Democratic convention

(to BERNSTEIN)

The Times has got to be full of it--
it cant be crazy Cubans

BERNSTEIN

What though

(points to Nixon)

It cant be the Republicans--hed
never allow something as stupid as
this not when hes gonna slaughter
McGovern anyway

WOODWARD
Right Nixon didnt get where he got
by being dumb--
(stops abruptly)
--listen that was a Watergate

question--
CUT TO
NIXON ON THE TUBE Serious now

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN staring at the set thinking

WOODWARD

WOODWARD

head)
I lived here all my life I got a
million contacts but theyre all
bus boys and bellhops

The reporter KEN RINGLE at the next desk watches them a
moment Then--

RINGLE

BERNSTEIN
Someone inside the White House would
be nice

RINGLE
(writes down phone
number)

As BERNSTEIN grabs for the phone--

CUT TO
A SECRETARIAL POOL IN A LARGE OFFICE

GIRL

Colson was big on secrets anyway

wouldnt have known anything

BERNSTEIN
Nothing at all you can remember

SECRETARY

BERNSTEIN
--Teddy Kennedy

SECRETARY

go see

SOUND of the phone being laid down
BERNSTEIN
--what do you think--

WOODWARD
--Hunt doesnt seem like your ordinary
consultant

BERNSTEIN
Maybe a political operative of some
sort-â€”

WOODWARD

--a spy you mean

BERNSTEIN
It makes sense Hunt worked for the
CIA and the White House was
paranoid about Teddy Kennedy

LIBRARIAN (V0O)
Mr Bernstein

BERNSTEIN
Yes maam

LIBRARIAN (V0O)

What I said before I was wrong The
truth is I dont have a card that
Mr Hunt took out any Kennedy
material

(WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN

listen and now there

is something in her

voice that wasnt

there before fear)
I remember getting that material out
for somebody but it wasnt Mr Hunt
The truth is Ive never had any
requests at all from Mr Hunt

(beat)
The truth is I dont know Mr Hunt

There is the SOUND of the phone being dropped into its cradle
BERNSTEIN continues to hold his He and WOODWARD just look
at each other Now--

CUT TO
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

Now as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN get out of a cab start inside-

CUT TO

A MALE LIBRARIAN IN HIS OFFICE
LIBRARIAN
You want all the material requested
by the White House

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN standing there The nod One of them
maybe says yessir the other maybe please The LIBRARIAN
moves out of his office into a corridor They go with him

No one else is around The LIBRARIAN looks at them quickly--

LIBRARIAN
All White House transactions are
confidential

And just like that hes back into his office and as he
shuts the door--

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking along through the Library of
Congress

WOODWARD
You think they are confidential I
dont know anything about how this
town works I havent lived here a
year yet

BERNSTEIN
We need a sympathetic face

On the word face--
CUT TO

A BEARDED YOUNG-LOOKING CLERK Were in the reading room of
the library and WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are with him

YOUNG CLERK
You want every request since when

BERNSTEIN
(to WOODWARD)
When did Hunt start at the White
House

WOODWARD
July of 71

BERNSTEIN
About the past year

CLERK
(starts to smile)
Im not sure you want â€˜em but I got
em
Now--

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN seated at a table with from anywhere
between 10 to 20 thousand slips of paper In front of them
seated at a high desk the bearded clerk looks down on them
shaking his head Its a staggering amount of work to thumb
through

CLERK
I cant believe you guys are actually
doing this

WOODWARD

(to the clerk)
You do a lot of things when youre
on a story

(to BERNSTEIN quietly)
Can you believe were actually doing
this

(BERNSTEIN cant)

Now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through
the slips it took them hours and hours and the afternoon
darkened as they worked And theyre tired Now--

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN getting back into a cab

BERNSTEIN
That was fun
(slams the door)
What now

WOODWARD
I met a Presidential aide once at a
social occasion

BERNSTEIN
(stunned)
And you havent called him--

As the taxi pulls off--

CUT TO

ROSENFELD

reading an article by BERNSTEINs desk WOODWARD sits on an
adjacent desk

ROSENFELD
(to BERNSTEIN)
You got accurate notes on the White
House librarian

(BERNSTEIN nods)
OK well leave space for the White
House denial and we should be set

Suddenly he gestures and we--
CUT TO

BRADLEE STANDING ACROSS THE ROOM Without a nod he moves
toward ROSENFELD

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN nervously watching BRADLEE come As
soon as BRADLEE is within earshot ROSENFELD starts his sell

ROSENFELD

Benjy we got a present for you
Above the fold on page one for sure
It may not change our lives one way
or the other Just a good solid
piece of American Journalism--

(beat)
--that The New York Times doesnt
have

BRADLEE by this time has taken the story grabbed an
unoccupied chair sat down started to read His only response
to ROSENFELD is an intermittent uh-huh uh-huh

CUT TO

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN watching as the silence goes on
ROSENFELD too He wants the story too but he doesnt want
it like WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN do They were as they said
proud of their work The silence goes on Finally BRADLEE
looks up

BRADLEE
You havent got it
(before they can reply)
A librarian and a secretary say Hunt
looked at a book
(shakes his head)
Not good enough

He begins editing the piece slashing paragraphs out of it

WOODWARD
I was told by this guy at the White
House that Hunt was investigating
Teddy Kennedy

BRADLEE
How senior
WOODWARD

(edgy)
You asking me to disclose my source

Other reporters are watching now BRADLEE is impatient as
always

BRADLEE
Just tell me his title

WOODWARD
I dont know titles

BRADLEE
Is he on the level of Assistant to
the President or not

WOODWARD doesnt know BRADLEE continues to hack at their
piece Done he stands walks away

BRADLEE
Get some harder information next
time

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN watch him go they are embarrassed
angry crushed HOLD on their faces Then--

CUT TO
WOODWARDS APARTMENT - MORNING

He is in pajamas and lugging a flower pot out to the balcony
positioning it so it would be visible to anyone passing in
the alley below He takes a stick with a red flag jams it
into the flower pot Hes nervous and he makes several
adjustments making sure the red flag is secure and wont
fall

CUT TO
WOODWARD down in the alley staring up at his apartment The
flag is clearly visible Its early He checks his watch
hurries out of the alley

CUT TO

THE CITY ROOM - NIGHT

Deserted except for a few older Front Page types reporters
whose legs have given out playing cards in a corner of the
room WOODWARD is working at his desk until he glances up at
a wall clock Its almost one on the button and as he rises--

CUT TO

WOODWARD racing down the stairway of the Post as he hits
the lobby he turns and we
CUT TO
OUTSIDE THE POST - NIGHT

WOODWARD appears in the side exit walks off When he gets
out of sight of the paper he starts to run Now--

CUT TO
WOODWARD turning a corner running on Up ahead is a cab--

CUT TO
WOODWARD IN THE CAB sitting forward tensely Occasionally
various monuments are briefly visible lit up in the bg
WOODWARD takes out some money as we

CUT TO

THE CAB stopping WOODWARD pays gets out The cab pulls
away When it is out of sight WOODWARD starts to run again

CUT TO

A STREET as WOODWARD runs by Its not the nicest area in
the world He is going faster now

CUT TO

A CAB GASSING UP AT A STATION WOODWARD hurries to it gets
in and--

CUT TO
THE SECOND CAB roaring along some Washington streets
CUT TO

WOODWARD INSIDE THE CAB He looks at his watch tries not to
seem nervous But his fingers are drumming drumming and--

CUT TO
THE SECOND CAB stopping as WOODWARD gets out pays The cab
starts off but slowly WOODWARD waits The cab doesnt turn
as the first one did WOODWARD still waits Finally the cab
turns and the second it does WOODWARD starts to run again
and--

CUT TO
WOODWARD turning a corner running on and--

CUT TO

ANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it finally stops and catches
his breath as we--

CUT TO
A GIGANTIC UNDERGROUND TYPE GARAGE

CUT TO
WOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE Its an eerie place and his
heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy yes hes edgy
He comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels hesitates

CUT TO
THE RAMP It seems to descend forever

CUT TO
WOODWARD starting down HOLD on him as he walks Down he
goes the shadows deepening then disappearing then covering
him again He continues on He must be at least at the first
underground level now but he doesnt stop and we dont stop
watching him as he continues to go down turning the SOUND
of his shoes softer now and hes a smaller figure as we watch
him circle around and around until we--

CUT TO

ANOTHER LEVEL UNDERGROUND Dimly lit A few cars parked here
and there WOODWARD hesitates on the ramp looks around

THE GARAGE Dark dark eerie
CUT TO

WOODWARD quietly stepping off the ramp continuing to glance
this way that way Now--

CUT TO
TWO CARS PARKED BESIDE EACH OTHER

Nothing unusual about that But then some cigarette smoke
appears trailing up and disappearing from between the cars
As WOODWARD moves forward--

CUT TO

A MAN SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES BETWEEN THE CARS smoking He
leans with his back against the wall

DEEP THROAT
I saw the flag signal--whats up

WOODWARD
Nothing thats the problem--the
storys gone underground
DEEP THROAT
You thought Id help out on specifics
(headshake)
Ill confirm what you get try to
keep you on the right track but
thats all
(looks at WOODWARD)
Are you guys really working
(WOODWARD nods)
How much

WOODWARD
I dont know maybe sixteen eighteen
hours a day--weve got sources at
Justice the FBI but its still
drying up

DEEP THROAT
Then there must be something mustnt
there Look forget the myths the
medias created about the White House--
the truth is these are not very
bright guys and things got out of
hand

WOODWARD
If you dont like them why wont
you be more concrete with me

DEEP THROAT
Because the press stinks too--history
on the run thats all youre
interested in
(inhales)
You come up with anything

WOODWARD

John Mitchell resigned as head of
CREEP to spend more time with his
family That doesnt exactly have
the ring of truth

(DEEP THROAT nods)
Howard Hunts been found--there was
talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand
in cash in a paper bag

DEEP THROAT
Follow the money Always follow the
money

WOODWARD
To where

DEEP THROAT
(shakes his head no
Go on
WOODWARD
This man Gordon Liddy--hes going to
be tried along with Hunt and the
five burglars--we know he knows a
lot we just dont know what

DEEP THROAT
(lights a new cigarette)
You changed cabs Youre sure no one
followed you

WOODWARD
I did everything you said but it
all seemed--

DEEP THROAT
--melodramatic
(headshakes)
Things are past that--remember these
are men with switchblade mentalities
who run the world as if it were Dodge
Cc

ity
WOODWARD
Whats the whole thing about--do you
know

DEEP THROAT
What I know youll have to find out
on your own

WOODWARD
Liddy--you think theres a chance
hell talk

DEEP THROAT
Talk Once at a gathering he put
his hand over a candle And he kept
it there He kept it right in the
flame until his flesh seared A woman
who was watching asked Whats the
trick And he replied The trick
is not minding

DEEP THROAT shakes his head walks off WOODWARD stands alone
now watching Now the shadows have the other man Just his
footsteps are audible WOODWARD stands there HOLD

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN

Its morning and hes struggling to get his bike down the
steps of his apartment building

CUT TO
WOODWARD driving up in his two-year-old red Karmann Ghia He
roars up alongside BERNSTEIN waving a folded-up newspaper

BERNSTEIN
Whats that

WOODWARD
The fucking New York Times

CUT TO

The Times spread somewhat tentatively over a mailbox A small
headline is visible with the words Barker Liddy and
Telephone in some kind of order WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN
look at it the best they can

BERNSTEIN
Goddamnit--

WOODWARD
--see--

BERNSTEIN
--Im trying--

WOODWARD

--fifteen phone calls--

BERNSTEIN
---fifteen or more phone calls from
the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy
at CREEP--

WOODWARD
Why didnt we get that

BERNSTEIN
Christ and I even know somebody at
the phone company--

WOODWARD
--you do--with access to records

As BERNSTEIN nods--
CUT TO
A LITTLE CITY PARK
A guy shells peanuts BERNSTEIN hurries up
BERNSTEIN
Why couldnt you have just dialed me

from the office Irwin

IRWIN
Cause Im not calling out from the
phone company anymore-â€”

(drops his voice)
--I think the place is bugged

BERNSTEIN
(taking some peanuts)
So tell me about the Times article

IRWIN
What do you want to know

BERNSTEIN
No games Irwin give

IRWIN

(looks at BERNSTEIN)
My big civil rights buddy--

(shakes his head)
--boy if John Mitchell was after
your phone records would you be
screaming

(eats)
Whatre you onto

BERNSTEIN
Something maybe big

IRWIN
And that makes anything you do OK
is that it

BERNSTEIN
Just tell me about the goddamn
article

IRWIN

(shelling away)
It was accurate but I cant get a
fuller listing for you--all Barkers
phone records have been subpoenaed

BERNSTEIN
Who by

IRWIN
A Miami DA The guy doing the
investigating is named Martin Dardis
(finishes his peanuts
starts off)

BERNSTEIN
Irwin I really feel bad doing

IRWIN looks at BERNSTEIN for a long time then--
IRWIN
Dont give me any more of your liberal
shit OK Carl

He walks off doesnt look back Now--

ROSENFELD

at the water fountain on the 5th floor He chews up
Maalox tablets notices BERNSTEIN steaming up

BERNSTEIN
Harry I just talked to a Miami
investigator about Barker--

ROSENFELD
--so

BERNSTEIN

send me to Miami

ROSENFELD heads for his office BERNSTEIN pursuing

ROSENFELD
Im the one sent you to Toronto

BERNSTEIN
(trying to head him
off)
--that was awhile ago--

ROSENFELD
--I think it might be helpful if

Deserters
(whirls on BERNSTEIN)
Im still waiting for it

He enters his office BERNSTEIN follows

BERNSTEIN
Down to Miami and back--how much
damage can I do

ROSENFELD
Youre the fella who forgot he rented
a Hertz car do I have to tell you

And he looks unsympathetically at BERNSTEIN--

CUT TO

a few
SIMONS circling around the 5th floor
step They keep moving throughout

ROSENFELD

CUT TO

ROSENFELD falls into

I can predict the next words youre

(SIMONS gestures for
ROSENFELD to continue)

I want to send a reporter to Miami

SIMONS
Anyone but Bernstein

ROSENFELD
Howard-â€”

SIMONS
--remember Toronto Harry

ROSENFELD
That was awhile ago

SIMONS

I dont get it--you were the one who

ROSENFELD

I know I did but damnit Howard--

(SIMONS looks at him)

For the first time since Ive known
him I think hes really humping

BERNSTEINS APARTMENT

CUT TO

A shambles He is busy doing two things at once studying
notebooks and packing Music plays lovely stuff the Bach

Brandenburgs As the phone rings--

BERNSTEIN
(answering)
Yeah
(pause)
Yes this is Carl Bernstein
(stunned)

Youre repossessing my bicycle

(softer)

Listen Im sure I paid this months
installment so why dont you check
your records before you go around

hassling people
(pause)
Oh
And as he stands there--

AN ATTRACTIVE EFFICIENT-LOOKING WOMAN of BERNSTEINs age
She has just entered the apartment Vivaldi is playing now

BERNSTEIN
Hannah I never would have bothered
you but Im off to Miami and theyre
gonna take away my ten speed unless
I get it straightened out fast

HANNAH
(glancing around the
chaos)
Where are your bills Carl

BERNSTEIN
Oh theyre here
(starts lifting debris
from his desk)
Im keeping much better records now
Hannah
(grabbing a big manila
envelope)
See
(hands it to her)

HANNAH

(looks inside)
Carl its a jungle

(sits at his desk

takes out a mass of

papers--glancing at

the top bill)
I suggest you either pay this
immediately or lay in a large supply
of candles

(studies another bill)
Youd give a stranger the shirt off
your back--except it wouldnt be
paid for

He smiles gently begins massaging her shoulders as she
studies his finances

BERNSTEIN
Hey very tense

HANNAH

(nods)
Lot of pressure at the Star

(looking at the bills)
Carl when we got married you were
four thousand dollars in debt when
we split you were solvent That may
prove to be the outstanding single
achievement of my life and now look
at this

(sighs)
How much did the damn bike cost

BERNSTEIN
Five hundred six maybe

HANNAH
(looking at paper)
Youre two months behind--you got
enough to cover

BERNSTEIN
I think

HANNAH
Give me your checkbook then

BERNSTEIN
Its right under that pile

He indicates a mound of papers She pulls it out as he
continues to massage her more sensually now She reaches
back puts her hand on his

HANNAH
I thought you had to get to Miami

BERNSTEIN
Theres always a later plane

HANNAH
Youre a sex junkie you know that
Carl

BERNSTEIN

Nobodys perfect

turned you into a bookkeeper

HANNAH looks at BERNSTEIN a moment then she smiles gently
shakes her head

HANNAH
Aw baby you can get it up I just
wonder if youll ever be able to get
it together
And quickly from that--
CUT TO

BERNSTEIN
seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office
Outside palm trees were in Miami And judging from the
number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench BERNSTEINs
been there a while Waiting Nervous And maybe he never

will be able to get it together who knows

At the front a SECRETARY sits filing her nails Behind her
are a number of closed doors to offices No one passes without
her OK The clock hits three in the afternoon as BERNSTEIN
gets up from the bench goes to the SECRETARY

BERNSTEIN
Hi its me Im still here

SECRETARY

BERNSTEIN

(smiles)
But not now

BERNSTEIN

eleven in the morning

SECRETARY
I told you he had to go out ona

CUT TO
THE BENCH as BERNSTEIN slumps back down He wipes his forehead
with his sleeve smokes a fresh cigarette is kind of
interested when a UNIFORMED COP walks up to the SECRETARY

who is now putting red polish on her nails

UNIFORMED COP
Is it OK to go on back

She nods
CUT TO

BERNSTEIN watching as the cop walks past the SECRETARY enters
an office behind

CUT TO
THE CLOCK ON THE WALL ITS QUARTER OF FOUR NOW

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
BERNSTEIN approaching the SECRETARY again She is working
on her right hand now

BERNSTEIN

BERNSTEIN He lights another cigarette puts it out then
lights another

CUT TO
THE SECRETARY

BERNSTEIN his bench a sea of cigarette butts slowly gets
up and goes to the SECRETARY

BERNSTEIN
Mr Dardis does call in every so
often

SECRETARY

Well of course

BERNSTEIN
(quietly)
Good Just tell him I was here that
Im sorry I missed him--

He walks out the double doors
CUT TO

BERNSTEIN IN HALLWAY He looks down the hall At the end
opposite the SECRETARYs reception room is a big glass door
with a sign reading Office of the Dade County Clerk
BERNSTEIN goes into a phone booth in the corridor from which
he can see both offices He puts in a dime and dials
BERNSTEIN

SECRETARY The phone RINGS and she punches the button on the
phone console

SECRETARY

CUT TO

BERNSTEIN watching from phone booth as the SECRETARY hurries
across the hallway As we see her open the door of the clerks
office BERNSTEIN bolts out of the phone booth and runs into
the reception room heading straight for the SECRETARYs desk

CUT TO

BERNSTEIN at her desk looking at the telephone console
receiver in hand He punches the button marked Intercom and
we can hear it BUZZ somewhere

VOICE (VO)

CUT TO

DARDIS emerging through one of the doors behind BERNSTEIN
BERNSTEIN see him

BERNSTEIN
(to DARDIS)

The New York Times--just say so
DARDIS
Listen Ive got a dinner--cant we

BERNSTEIN
(headshake)
Im on deadline

CUT TO

DARDIS OFFICE He is fiddling with a combination lock at a
filing cabinet BERNSTEIN is seated across DARDIS desk

DARDIS
You want Barkers phone stuff or his

BERNSTEIN

He hands BERNSTEIN some papers glances at his watch

DARDIS

BERNSTEIN
(flying through what
hes been handed)
The telephone calls we know about

DARDIS

in Mexican cashiers checks--

BERNSTEIN

BERNSTEIN continues to fly through the papers
BERNSTEIN
(continuing stops)

CUT TO

CLOSE UP--CASHIERS CHECK Its drawn on the First Bank and
Trust Company of Boca Raton Florida its dated April 10
and its for 25 thousand dollars payable to the order to
Kenneth H Dahlberg

DARDIS VOICE
That the twenty-five grand one--
Dont know--

CUT TO

BERNSTEIN starting to copy the check in a meticulous
facsimile DARDIS watches

DARDIS
I never could figure just who this
Dahlberg was
(watching BERNSTEIN)
Think it might be anything

BERNSTEIN
(casually)
This
(shrugs)
Naw

And from here quickly--
ZOOM TO

BERNSTEIN IN A PHONE BOOTH in the lobby of the Justice
Building Wildly excited--

BERNSTEIN
--Woodward--Woodward listen I dont
know what I got--

(holding the Dahlberg
facsimile)
--and I think the Times has it too--
(big)
--but somewhere theres a Kenneth H
Dahlberg in this world and weve
gotta find him--

And now comes
THE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG

This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from
one reporter to the other both of them desperately trying
to locate a man names DAHLBERG

WOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post sweating
surrounded by Whos Who and Dictionary of American Biographies
and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities--

BERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building
sweating with a pile of dimes as he dials away

This took them hours and that effort should be visible to

us They tire grow punchy but they keep on checking phone
book and dialing numbers and God knows what else The point
is we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount
of time but we also want people to know there was effort
involved

CUT TO

WOODWARD bleary in the reference room a girl comes in a
researcher librarian type

RESEARCHER
Were you after the Dahlberg articles
from the files
(WOODWARD nods)
There arent any sorry

And now she drops a piece of paper a photo--

WOODWARD
Whazzis

RESEARCHER
(shrugs)
Our Dahlberg file
As she leaves--
CUT TO
The photo
It is a picture of Hubert Humphrey standing next to another
man The caption identifies that other man as KENNETH
DAHLBERG Now--
CUT TO
WOODWARD AT HIS DESK
The room is reasonably quiet ROSENFELD is visible in his

office As WOODWARD picks up the phone gets Minneapolis
information--

CUT TO
ROSENFELDS PHONE RINGING He hurries in grabs it
BERNSTEINS VOICE (V0O)
Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg--
ROSENFELD
--Woodwards talking to him know
CUT TO

BERNSTEIN drenched There are no dimes left He listens a
moment more then nods hangs up leans back against the
glass takes a deep breath closes his eyes as we
CUT TO
WOODWARD on the phone

WOODWARD
--this should take only a minute
Mr Dahlberg but were doing a follow-
up on the break-in--
(pause)
--and I was kind of curious about
your check

DAHLBERG (VO)
check

WOODWARD
The twenty-five thousand dollar one
(silence)
The one with your name on it
(silence)

In Bernard Barkers Florida account
(still nothing)
Bernard Barker the Watergate burglar--

DAHLBERG (VO)
(struggling)
youre definitely doing a story

WOODWARD
Yes sir

DAHLBERG (VO)
Im a proper citizen Im a decent
man I dont do anything that isnt
decent or proper
(WOODWARD waits pen
ready tense as hell)
I know I shouldnt tell you this

WOODWARDs lips are going tell me tell me

DAHLBERG (VO)
That twenty-five thousand dollars is
money I collected for Nixon in this
years campaign

WOODWARD
I see And how do you think it reached
Miami

DAHLBERG (VO)
I dont know I really dont The
last time I saw it was when I was in
Washington I gave it to the Finance
department of the Committee to Re-
Elect the President How it got to
that burglar your guess is as good
as mine
WOODWARD
(trying to keep his
voice level)
That checks out with our finding
thank you Mr Dahlberg
CUT TO
AN ARTICLE WITH WOODWARDS NAME ON THE BYLINE
ROSENFELD holds it

ROSENFELD
CREEP financed the Watergate break-
in Jesus Christ

He starts off

WOODWARD
One sec--

WOODWARD takes the story scrawls BERNSTEINs name in front
of his on the byline ROSENFELD watches As WOODWARD finishes
he takes the story again hurries off Now--

CUT TO
THE HEADLINE OF THEIR STORY
Campaign Funds Found in Watergate Burglars Account
Now--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

that it isnt exactly a gigantic headline piece As a matter
of fact as more and more of page one appears we see that
their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and
bigger headlines are visible--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

--the whole first page Plastered across the top in giant
letters is the following EAGLETON RESIGNS And as you
look at the whole page now you can barely make out the tiny
piddling Watergate story The point is abundantly clear
nobody cared a whole lot

CUT TO
THE TRIANGLE
being rung like crazy And as it SOUNDS--

CUT TO
THE BUDGET MEETING

SIMONS
--OK last go-round Foreign anything
else

The foreign editor an enormously thoughtful-looking and
respected man indicates no

SIMONS
(to another editor)
National

NATIONAL EDITOR
Ill stand with the Eagleton follow-
ups and McGovern not being able to
get a replacement--thats your page
one stuff right there Howard--

SIMONS
--Metropolitan--

ROSENFELD
--you are ignoring the importance of
the Dahlberg repercussions-â€”

NATIONAL EDITOR
--nobody gives a shit about the
Dahlberg repercussions-â€”

ROSENFELD
(to NATIONAL EDITOR)
--quit equivocating say what you
mean--
(to SIMONS and BRADLEE)
--our story got Government Accounting
to start an audit on CREEPs finances--

BRADLEE
--and we printed that didnt we
Harry And when the frigging audits
done well print that too--

NATIONAL EDITOR
--let me tell what happened when I
was having lunch today at the Sans
Souci--

ROSENFELD
--correction--when you were drinking
your lunch at the bar of the Sans
Souci--

NATIONAL EDITOR
--this White House guy a good one
a pro came up and asked what is
this Watergate compulsion with you
guys and I said well we think its
important and he said if its so
goddamn important who the hell are
Woodward and Bernstein

ROSENFELD
Ask him what hes really saying--he
means take the story away from
Woodstein and give it to his people
at the National Desk--

NATIONAL EDITOR
--well Ive got some pretty
experienced fellas sitting around
wouldnt you say so--

ROSENFELD
--absolutely--and thats all they
do sit sit sit--every once ina
while they call up a Senator some
reporting--

NATIONAL EDITOR
--well what if your boys get it
wrong--

BRADLEE
(after a beat)
Then its our asses isnt it

SIMONS
(indicates the meeting
is over)
And well all have to go to work for
a living

As the men rise and head for the door the FOREIGN EDITOR
moves toward BRADLEE and SIMONS who remain seated as before

FOREIGN EDITOR
I dont think either Metropolitan or
National should cover the story
(BRADLEE and SIMONS
look at him)
I dont think we should cover the
story period

BRADLEE
Go on

FOREIGN EDITOR
Its not that were using unnamed
sources that bothers me or that
everything we print the White House
denies or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff
SIMONS
What then

FOREIGN EDITOR
I dont believe the goddamn story
Howard it doesnt make sense

BRADLEE
It will it just hasnt bottomed out
yet give it time

FOREIGN EDITOR
Ben Jesus there are over two
thousand reporters in this town are
there five on Watergate Where did
we suddenly get all this wisdom

BRADLEE and SIMONS say nothing They respect this guy

FOREIGN EDITOR

Look--why would the Republicans do
it --my God McGovern is self-
destructing before our eyes--just
like Muskie did Humphrey the bunch
of â€˜em

(sits on the table

talks quietly on)
Why would the burglars have put the
tape around the door instead of up
and down unless they wanted to get
caught Why did they take a walkie-
talkie and then turn it off unless
they wanted to get caught Why would
they use McCord--the only direct
contact to the Republicans

BRADLEE
You saying the Democrats bugged
themselves

FOREIGN EDITOR

The FBI thinks its possible--the

Democrats need a campaign issue

corruptions always a good one
(rises starts out)

Get off the story Ben--or put some

people on McGoverns finances fair

He leaves BRADLEE and SIMONS stay where they are both of
them flattened by what the guys said Because theyre not
sure hes wrong HOLD Now--

UNION GUY

Big fuckin cookie jar

As he turns to the sports section--
CUT TO
GETTING THE CREEP LIST SEQUENCE

Either they get it as it is now or as they really did from
a Post researcher who knew someone In ant case we see the
list with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices
and phone extensions

We also see the two of them working first making long
attempts at figuring out who worked for whom at CREEP

Then once they have that they begin using the cross-â€”
reference phone books which are not familiar to moviegoers
And from these they begin to get the home addresses of the
various small-fry people who work for CREEP

Near the end alphabetically there is a common female name
Jane Smith or something like that As BERNSTEIN runs his
finger down the addresses something strikes him as familiar
and as he reaches for the phone--

CUT TO
A CRUMMY-LOOKING BAR - MID-DAY

BERNSTEIN enters looks around then smiles and moves to a
lovely girl with a sweet face who probably weighs 200 pounds
She is sitting alone in a corner booth She nods to BERNSTEIN
cant quite pull off a smile
BERNSTEIN
(sits across)
This is practically a high school
reunion for us Jane--I would have
sprung for a classier place

JANE
Anyplace really public theyd know
about it--they know everything at
the Committee Carl--

BERNSTEIN
--you dont really think youre being
followed

JANE

This girlfriend of mine at the
Committee the other day she went
back to the DA to tell the things
the FBI didnt ask her That night
her boss he knew what shed done
They control everything thats how
they know it all

BERNSTEIN
FBI too

JANE

You dont believe me Well I was
working the weekend of the break-in
and my God all the executives were
running around like crazy--you had
to practically wait in line to use
the shredding machine--and when the
FBI came to investigate they never
even asked me about it

BERNSTEIN
If you dont like it down there why
dont you quit

JANE
I dont know what theyd do to me

BERNSTEIN
(reaching over)
Hey easy
JANE
(headshake)

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN

glances around)

BERNSTEIN
(moving toward her
voice)
I can help if youll--

JANE (0S)
--stay away from me Carl

CUT TO

JANE IN THE DARKNESS If she was scared earlier its panic-
time now She turns hurries off

BERNSTEIN watches her Suddenly a SOUND comes from the
darkness behind him He whirls It was nothing but from the
way he jumped when it happened you can tell the fear is
spreading
Now from Washington in darkness--

on the door nearest him Now 710 is wide open and several

WOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes The maids
look at him a moment He knocks again louder

SECOND MAID

WOODWARD

tell

BERNSTEIN

WOODWARD

of a flashlight

BERNSTEIN
I dont get it this really was my
turf
WOODWARD
(concentrating on the

map)
Youre not a kid anymore

BERNSTEIN
(shaking his head)
My first day as a copy boy I was
sixteen and wearing my only grown-up
suit--it was cream colored At 230
the head copy boy comes running up
to me and says My God havent you
washed the carbon paper yet If its
not washed by three itll never by
dry for tomorrow

(WOODWARD is getting

interested in the

story now)
And I said Am I supposed to do
that and he said Absolutely
its crucial So I run around and
grab all the carbon paper from all
the desks and take it to the mens
room Im standing there washing it
and its splashing all over me and
the editor comes in to take a leak
and he says What the fuck do you
think youre doing And I said
Its 230 Im washing the carbon
paper

(BERNSTEIN looks at

WOODWARD )
Just wanted you to know Ive done
dumber things than get us lost thats
all

WOODWARD goes back to his map BERNSTEIN continues to smoke
staring around at the night

CUT TO

WOODWARD - AT THE FRONT OF A HOUSE A sweet old lady is
looking out at him

WOODWARD

CLOSE UP - MISS ABBOTT

And from nowhere suddenly she bursts into tears

MISS ABBOTT
Im sorry--

ZOOM TO

CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as her door slams in their faces

They just look at each other

upset

bewildered And a little bit

their upset increases as the rejections go on

WHOLE SERIES OF FACES

CUT TO

in quick succession--theyre all in various doorways men
young old The only thing in common is their fear

women

MIDDLE-AGED MAN
(literally trembling)
God its just so awful--

And as he closes the door

A YOUNG GIRL
--I cant--Id like to but--
(thats all shell
say)

And as her door starts to shut

CUT TO

CUT TO
OLD MAN
--go--youve got to go before they
see you--please--

And as he almost starts to beg
CUT TO

OLD WOMAN
--no good

She stands there shaking her head back and forth back and
forth pathetic and sad Now--

CUT TO
WOODWARD

He is seated alone staring at his coffee cup surrounded by
junk food debris We are in a Hot Shoppe its night and as
BERNSTEIN comes up with food theyre dressed differently
from before BERNSTEIN puts more junk food and coffee down

BERNSTEIN

You had the Mighty Mo and the fries
without gravy right
(WOODWARD shrugs)

BERNSTEIN passes over some food They both look bleary and
in foul moods Silently they start to eat something they
continue doing throughout Theyre not hungry they just
eat

WOODWARD
This is terrific work if you like
rejection

BERNSTEIN
I never scared anyone before

WOODWARD
Its not us they were scared before
we got there
(looks at BERNSTEIN)
What do we know

BERNSTEIN
Facts or theory

WOODWARD
Anything youve got

BERNSTEIN
We know theres got to be something
or they wouldnt be so panicked
WOODWARD
And that somethings got to be more
than just Hunt Liddy and the five
burglars--those indictments are gonna
be bullshit when they come down
What else do we know

BERNSTEIN
I just wish we knew when someone
would talk to us thats all

The continue to eat bleary and numb as we
CUT TO
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN--
--kind of an honest hard-working face
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are standing in her doorway

WOODWARD
A friend at the Committee told us to
contact you--

WOMAN
--who was it

BERNSTEIN
We never reveal our sources which
is why you can talk to us

WOODWARD
Its safe try it youll see

She doesnt talk at first but she doesnt slam the door
either

BERNSTEIN
We understand your problem--

WOODWARD
--you believe in the President you
wouldnt ever want to do anything
disloyal

BERNSTEIN
We appreciate your position--really

And now she starts at last to talk and they expect it to
be their first breakthrough but when it turns out to be the
most withering onslaught yet they are stunned

WOMAN
You people--you think that you can
come into someones life squeeze
what you want then get out
(to BERNSTEIN)
You dont appreciate a goddamn thing
mister
(to WOODWARD)
And you dont understand nothing
(voice rising)
But the Committees briefed us on
you--so get the hell out of here--
(big)
--do you like scaring the life out
of decent people--cause if you
dont in the name of God--stop it

And she slams the door--
CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN slowly walking back in silence back
to the car

WOODWARD
At Yale once they held an auction
There was this woman and her name
was Lulu Landis Her postcards came
up for sale She had 1400 postcards
written to her and Id never heard
of her before but I knew I had to
have those cards I had to know why
anyone would get so many messages I
paid sixty-five dollars for them
I got all crazy trying to work it
out and first it was just a maze but
then I found that her husband killed
imself in Dayton and once I had
that it all began to open an
evangelist had come to Dayton and
is horses hit Lulu Landis at the
corner of 13th and Vermillion and
she was paralyzed Permanently and
er favorite thing til then had been
traveling and all her friends
whenever they went anyplace they
wrote her Those cards they were
er eyes

They continue to walk slowly
CUT TO
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN--IN HIS DOORWAY

MIDDLE-AGED MAN
I know who you are and Im not afraid
but that dont mean Ill talk to you
either--youre just a couple Democrats
out to stop Nixon getting re-elected
CUT TO
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN staring at the man

WOODWARD
Democrats

MIDDLE-AGED MAN
Thats right

BERNSTEIN

WOODWARD

WOODWARD)

WOODWARD

WOODWARD

BERNSTEIN

WOODWARD

BERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we--
CUT TO
ANOTHER SERIES OF CREEP EMPLOYEES

Only they arent slamming doors theyre sitting in various
rooms of their houses and apartments We dont see the
reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive
make it self-evident We start with the middle-aged man seen
above

MIDDLE-AGED MAN
Mitchell never left the Committee--
he resigned sure but he was there
as much as before--

CUT TO
YOUNGER MAN

--oh dont worry Gordon Liddy will

the right word)

YOUNGER WOMAN

CUT TO
RICHARD NIXONS SOMBER VISAGE

NIXON
-No one in this administration
presently employed was involved in
this very bizarre incident

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD in a crummy cafeteria watching the
evening news on the TV set high on the wall WOODWARD eats a
hamburger BERNSTEIN smokes sips coffee It is night as
usual now

CUT TO
NIXON--on the tube

NIXON
What really hurts in matters of
this sort is not the fact that they
occur because overzealous people in
campaigns do things that are wrong
What really hurts is if you try to
cover it up

CUT TO
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as the news commentator come on begins
introducing another story

WOODWARD
Did he just say what I think he said

BERNSTEIN
You voted for him

He gives WOODWARD a big smile WOODWARD eats his hamburger
in silence

CUT TO
A DIFFERENT TIME A DIFFERENT PLACE--EARLY EVENING

BERNSTEIN gets out of his car walks up and knocks on the
door of a small tract house in the DC suburbs A woman
opens the door

BERNSTEIN
Hi Im Carl Bernstein of the
Washington Post and--

WOMAN
--oh you dont want me you want my
sister
(calls out)
For you
And we--

CUT TO

THE BOOKKEEPER approaching the door Shes younger than the
clichÃ© version of a bookkeeper As she looks at her sister--

BOOKKEEPERS SISTER
This here is Carl Bernstein--

BOOKKEEPER
--omigod youre from that place

youve got to go

The sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette
table

BERNSTEIN
Could I bum one of your cigarettes--

As the sister starts for the pack--

BERNSTEIN
--dont bother Ill get it

And he crosses ten feet inside the front door
BOOKKEEPER
Youve really got to go

BERNSTEIN
Just let me get a match

He goes into the living room area picks up a book of matches
This whole scene moves slowly the tension building under it--
its not like news people talking nothing overlaps here

BERNSTEIN
But I want you to know that I
understand why youre afraid--a lot
of good people down there at the
Committee are afraid Im really
sorry for what youre being put
through

BOOKKEEPER
All those articles you people write--
where do you find that stuff

BERNSTEIN
We dont tell anyone that Which is
why you can talk to us And if we
cant verify what you say someplace
else we dont print it Thats
another reason you can relax

BOOKKEEPER
(tense)
Im relaxed--light your cigarette

BERNSTEIN lights the cigarette

BERNSTEIN
You were Hugh Sloans bookkeeper
when he worked for Maurice Stans at
Finance and we were sort of
wondering did you go work for Stans
immediately after Sloan quit or was
there a time lapse

BOOKKEEPER
I never worked for Sloan or Stans

BOOKKEEPERS SISTER
(out of the blue to
BERNSTEIN)
Would you like some coffee or
anything

As the BOOKKEEPER winces
BERNSTEIN

(like a shot)
Please yes thank you
(he looks at the
BOOKKEEPER)
Can I sit down for a minute

He is by a couch

BOOKKEEPER
One minute but then--

BERNSTEIN
--right right Ive got to go
(he sits)
Why did you lie just then

The BOOKKEEPER kneads her hands together silently

watches

BERNSTEIN
I was just curious--you dont do it
well so I wondered Have you been
threatened if you told the truth
is that it

BOOKKEEPER
No never in so many words

BERNSTEIN
(gently)
Its obvious you want to talk to
someone--well Im someone

He takes out his notebook

BERNSTEIN

CUT TO

The BOOKKEEPER And she does want to talk But the notebook

scares her terribly and she can only stare at it

BERNSTEIN
Im not even going to put your name
down Its just so I can keep things
straight
(beat)
Start with the money why dont you

BOOKKEEPERS SISTER
(returning with coffee)
How do you like it

BERNSTEIN
Everything please

BOOKKEEPERS SISTER
(going again)

I wont be a minute

BERNSTEIN
(to the BOOKKEEPER
quietly)

The General Accounting report said
there was a 350 thousand cash slush
fund in Stans safe Did you know
about that from the beginning

BOOKKEEPER
(about to fold)

There are too many people watching
me--they know I know a lot--

BERNSTEIN

--it was all in hundreds wasnt it

A

BOOKKEEPER
lot of it was I just thought it

was sort of an all-purpose political
fund--you know for taking fat cats
to dinner things like that

BERNSTEIN

Could buy a lot of steaks 350000
dollars

I

BOOKKEEPER
(her words are coming
faster)
cant be positive that it was used

for the break-in but people sure are
worried

T

BERNSTEIN
hich people

BOOKKEEPER
he ones who could disburse the money

BERNSTEIN
ho were they

BOOKKEEPER
here were a group of them--I think

five I dont know their names

BERNSTEIN

Sloan knew which five didnt he

(she nods)

BOOKKEEPERS SISTER
(back with cream and
sugar)

Here we are

I

BOOKKEEPER
dont want to say anymore
BERNSTEIN
(indicating coffee)
Its awfully hot--
(smiles)
--and you havent finished telling
me about the money--

BOOKKEEPER

(long pause then--in

a burst)
--omigod there was so much of it
six million came in one two-day period--
six million cash we couldnt find
enough places to put it I thought
it was all legal I guess I did til
after the break-in when I remembered
Gordon got so much of it

BERNSTEIN
(heart starting to
pound)
Gordon Liddy you mean

BOOKKEEPER

(nods)
It was all so crazy--the day after
the break-in he gave us a speech
bouncing up and down on his heels in
that loony way of his--Gordon told
us not to let Jim McCord ruin
everything--dont let one bad apple
spoil the barrel he said You just
know that when Gordon Liddys calling
someone a bad apple somethings
wrong somewhere

(more and more moved

now)
Its all so rotten and getting
worse and all I care about is
Hugh Sloan His wife was going to
leave him if he didnt stand up and
do what was right And he quit He
quit because he saw it and didnt
want any part of it

BERNSTEIN
Think Sloans being set up as a fall
guy for John Mitchell Sometimes it
looks that way

There is a pause Then--

BOOKKEEPER
If you guys if you guys could
just get John Mitchell that would

be beautiful
And now as long last she begins to cry HOLD on her tears
then--

CUT TO

A TYPEWRITER

clicking away The words INTERVIEW WITH X SEPT 14 are
visible There is music in the background really blasting
away Rachmaninoff or worse

We are in WOODWARDs apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating
notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview Its very late and
BERNSTEIN has notes on everything matchboxes and its hard
for him to read Theyre both really excited BERNSTEIN from
his coffee jag WOODWARD by what BERNSTEINs dictating

BERNSTEIN
I couldnt believe what she told
me Eight cups of coffee worth

WOODWARD
Go on go on--

BERNSTEIN
--weve got to find out who the five
guys are--the five with access to
the slush fund--they were aware of
the break-in

WOODWARD
Then tomorrows grand jury indictments
will just be bullshit

BERNSTEIN
It goes very high--weve got to find
out where--

WOODWARD
--we will--

BERNSTEIN
--she was really paranoid the
bookkeeper

WOODWARD

That happens to people
(he goes over turns
the hi-fi on even
louder Shouts--)

OK go on

The noise blasts away as BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD hunch over
the typewriter Its a moment of genuine exhilaration
Paranoid sure but for the first time theyre really on to
something its all starting to split open
CUT TO
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN

They are driving through McLean Virginia a development of
identical imitation Tudor houses

BERNSTEIN
How do you want to handle Sloan

WOODWARD
You mean whos going to play the
mean MP and whos going to be the
nice one
(BERNSTEIN nods
WOODWARD shrugs)
Whichever

BERNSTEIN
Hes another Ivy Leaguer so hell
probably expect you to be
understanding--might surprise him if
youre not

WOODWARD
You want me to be the bastard

BERNSTEIN
(nods)
And Ill just shitkick in my usual
way

As they drive on--
CUT TO

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN standing in the doorway of one of the
Tudor houses She is very pregnant She knows instinctively
who they are and she dominates them in a genuinely proud
female way What I mean is its her scene and theyre
suddenly embarrassed to be bothering her

WOODWARD
To see Mr Sloan

MRS SLOAN

Hes out

(There is a pause

She studies them--)
Youre those two from the Post arent
you

(they nod)
Ill tell him

BERNSTEIN
(as shes about to
step back inside)
This must be a difficult time for
the both of you

MRS SLOAN
This is an honest house

WOODWARD
Thats why we wanted to see your
husband

She studies them still more silence

MRS SLOAN
That decision is up to him

BERNSTEIN
(conspiratorially)
Maybe you could put in a good word

WOODWARD
Weve got another appointment tonight
in this area--well just stop back
later all right

MRS SLOAN
Its a free country--
(beat)
--in theory

They nod start back down the walk She watches them
MRS SLOAN
(calling out)
Be careful--
They turn look back at her
CUT TO

CLOSE UP--MRS SLOAN

MRS SLOAN
--you can destroy lives

CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN watching her She seems like a terrific
girl And maybe theyve upset her Or maybe what she has

said coming from her has more impact than otherwise
Quietly they turn back walk in silence toward the red
Karmann Ghia

CUT TO
THE McLEAN McDONALDS--DINNERTIME Lots of very noisy happy

children WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sit surrounded by their
usual array of junk food
WOODWARD
Think Sloans back
(BERNSTEIN seems lost
in thought)
Whats wrong

BERNSTEIN
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb
Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike
freak than I am
(sips coffee)
I never like it when the other guys
human

They continue to sip coffee outside it continues to rain
Now--

CUT TO
A YOUNG SLENDER GUY answering his door

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand outside their jackets over
their heads protecting themselves from the rain which is
harder now

WOODWARD
Mr Sloan

SLOAN
(nods)
My wife told me to expect you
(softly)
As you know I havent talked to the
press

BERNSTEIN
We were hoping that maybe now you
could We know why you left the
Committee We know youre not guilty
of anything But we know you know
who is--

It has begun to rain even harder
SLOAN
--look come in Well have to be
quiet--my wifes asleep
CUT TO
A CHRISTMAS CARD from the Nixons they are standing in front
of the White House Christmas tree It is signed To Hugh and

Debbie Sloan with thanks Richard M Nixon Patricia Nixon

PULL BACK
and were in the living room More coffee is being drunk
SLOAN endlessly stirs his

SLOAN
Id like to talk to you I really
would but my lawyers say I shouldnt
until after the Watergate trial

WOODWARD
You handed out the money Maybe
theres a legitimate explanation for
the way it was done--

BERNSTEIN
--then again maybe things are even
worse than weve written--

SLOAN
--theyre worse Thats why I quit

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN wait as SLOAN is clearly going through
a struggle with himself Then--

SLOAN
Try and understand this Im a decent
Republican I believe in Richard
Nixon I worked in the White House
four years--so did my wife What
happened on June 17 I dont think
the President knew anything about
Some of his men Im not so sure of

BERNSTEIN
Do you think the truth will come out
at the trial

SLOAN
Thats another of the things Im not
so sure of

BERNSTEIN
Because people at the Committee were
told to lie to the prosecutors

SLOAN
We were never told flat out Dont
talk But the message was clear

BERNSTEIN
To cover up

SLOAN
Well they sure didnt ask us to
come forward and tell the truth

WOODWARD
Does they mean the White House
SLOAN
As opposed to the Committee The
Committees not an independent
operation Everything is cleared
with the White House I dont think
that the FBI or the prosecutors
understand that

WOODWARD

The report on the cash in Maurice
Stans safe the three hundred fifty
thousand thats true

SLOAN
No It was closer to seven hundred
thousand

WOODWARD
And as treasurer you could release
those funds

SLOAN
(nods)
When so ordered

WOODWARD
Were not sure weve got all the
guys who could order you but we
know there were five
(SLOAN is silent)

BERNSTEIN
(ticking them off
Mitchell Stans Magruder theyre
obvious--

SLOAN stirs his coffee

WOODWARD
--there had to be a White House
overseer-â€”

BERNSTEIN
--Colson

SLOAN

Colsons too smart to get directly
involved with something like that

WOODWARD
(to BERNSTEIN)
Haldeman
(to SLOAN)
Right

SLOAN
I wont talk about the other two

BERNSTEIN
But they both worked at the White
House

SLOAN
(softly)
I will not talk about the other two

BERNSTEIN
(out of the blue)
Kalmbach--Nixons personal lawyer

SLOAN is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach

SLOAN
I cant say anything Im sorry
(He starts to rise)

WOODWARD
One thing Im not completely clear
on--when you gave out the money to
Liddy how did that work

SLOAN

Badly

(and now for the first

time he almost smiles)
You dont realize how close all this
came to staying undiscovered--I gave
Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave
it to Barker who took it to Miami
and deposited it

BERNSTEIN
Right

SLOAN
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand
in hundred dollar bills and gave it
back to Liddy who gave it back to me
and I put it in the office safe which
was crammed

WOODWARD
Go on

SLOAN
Well when Liddy came and asked for
money for what turned out to be the
break-in funds I went to the safe
and gave him--out of this whole
fortune--I happened to give him the
same hundreds he gave me--banks have
to keep track of hundreds If the
money had been in fifties or if Id
grabbed a different stack there
probably wouldnt have been any
Watergate story

BERNSTEIN
Ordinarily though what was the
procedure

SLOAN
Routine--Id just call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department and
hed say go ahead give out the
money

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN just look at each other--they hadnt

OF THEM heading across the foyer

BERNSTEIN
What happens when the baby comes

SLOAN

Ive been looking for a job but its
been hard My names been in the

papers too much Sometimes I wonder
if reporters understand how much
pain they can inflict in just one
sentence Im not thinking of myself
But my wife my parents its been
very rough on them

and WOODWARD looking very uncomfortable as

SLOAN

I wish I could put down on paper
what its like--you come to Washington
because you believe in something
and then you get inside and you see
how things actually work and you
watch your ideals disintegrate

(beat)
The people inside the people in the
White House they start to believe
they can suspend the rules because
theyre fulfilling a mission That
becomes the only important thing--
the mission Its so easy to lose
perspective We want to get out before

CUT TO

CUT TO

SLOAN
we lose ours altogether

SLOAN opens the front door WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pause
nod almost an embarrassed pause Then as they hurry out
into the rain--

CUT TO
A NERFBALL

flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window When we

PULL BACK

were in BRADLEEs office SIMONS and ROSENFELD are also
there along with WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN BRADLEE plays
nerfball mostly he hasnt got the worldss longest attention
span

BERNSTEIN
Look--five men controlled that slush
fund as CREEP--three of them weve

were pretty sure of Kalmbach

WOODWARD

BRADLEE
This is a daily paper well explain

Youre certain on Mitchell

WOODWARD
He approved the payments to Liddy
while he was still Attorney General--

And all this now goes fast--

ROSENFELD
--you got more than one source--

BERNSTEIN
--yes--

SIMONS
--has any of them got an ax--

ROSENFELD
--political personal sexual

WOODWARD
--no--
SIMONS

BERNSTEIN

BRADLEE
--goddamnit whens somebody gonna

ROSENFELD
--who you got--

WOODWARD
--well Sloan--

BERNSTEIN
--and we got a guy in Justice--

BRADLEE
--Deep Throat--

WOODWARD
--I saw him He verifies

BRADLEE

OK

(now after the burst

of talk a pause)
Youre about to write a story that
says that the former Attorney General--
the man who represented law in America--
is a crook

(throws the nerfball)
Just be right huh

As WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN leave the office--

BRADLEE
Leave plenty of room for his denial

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK ON THE PHONE He has some papers in
front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand He is
tired and very very nervous It is dark outside In what

follows BERNSTEIN takes notes

OPERATORS VOICE (VO)
Essex House can I help you

BERNSTEIN
John Mitchell please

There is a BUZZING SOUND Then--

JOHN MITCHELLS VOICE (V0O)
Yes

BERNSTEIN
Sir this is Carl Bernstein of the
Washington Post and Im sorry to
bother you but were running a story
in tomorrows paper that we thought
you should have a chance to comment
on

MITCHELL (VO)
What does it say

BERNSTEIN
(starting to read)
John N Mitchell while serving as
US Attorney General personally
controlled a secret cash fund that--

MITCHELL (VO)
--jeeeeeecesus-â€”

BERNSTEIN
--fund that was used to gather
information against the Democrats--

MITCHELL (VO)
--jeeeeeecesus-â€”

BERNSTEIN
--according to sources involved in
the Watergate investigation Beginning
in the spring of 1971--

MITCHELL (VO)
--jeeeeeecesus-â€”

BERNSTEIN
--almost a year before he left the
Justice Department--

MITCHELL (VO)
--jeeeeeeeeesus-â€”

BERNSTEIN
--to become President Nixons campaign
manager on March 1 Mitchell
personally approved withdrawals from
the fund--

MITCHELL (VO)
--all that crap youre putting it
in the paper Its all been denied
You tell your publisher--tell Katie
Graham shes gonna get her tit caught
in a big fat wringer if thats
published Good Christ Thats the
most sickening thing I ever heard

BERNSTEIN
Sir Id like to ask you a few--

MITCHELL (VO)
--what time is it

BERNSTEIN
1130

MITCHELL (VO)
Morning or night

BERNSTEIN
Night

MITCHELL (VO)
Oh

And he hangs up
CUT TO

BRADLEE and BERNSTEIN at BERNSTEINs desk BRADLEE is going
over BERNSTEINs notes

BRADLEE
He really made that remark about
Mrs Graham
(BERNSTEIN nods)
This is a family newspaper--cut the
words her tit and run it

And now suddenly--
THE PRESSES OF THE POST
rolling the story Theyre modern and gigantic and
CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN Theyre in the lobby of the Post at
night and through a thick-pane of glass theyre watching
their story roll and on their faces is something you dont
expect to see panic

BRADLEE comes up behind them looks down at the presses
starts to talk

BRADLEE
Once when I was reporting Lyndon
Johnsons top guy gave me the word
they were looking for a successor to
J Edgar Hoover I wrote it and the
day it appeared Johnson called a
press conference and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life And when
he was done he turned to his top
guy and the President said Call
Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you

(shakes his head)
I took a lot of static for that--
everyone said You did it Bradlee
you screwed up--you stuck us with
Hoover forever--

(looks at WOODWARD

and BERNSTEIN)
--I screwed up but I wasnt wrong

They all watch the presses now

BRADLEE
You guys havent been wrong yet is
that why youre scared shitless
(as WOODWARD and
BERNSTEIN nod BRADLEE
starts away)
You should be

CUT TO
THE PRESSES continuing to roll The SOUND is incredible Now--
CUT TO
A TELETYPE MACHINE

clacking away like crazy We can read the words The Senator
finished by saying that although he was and from there--

DISSOLVE TO

A SENATOR and while the words although he was are still
very fresh in our minds--

SENATOR
Although I am a Republican I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit that I feel only sadness that
a once fine journal of record like
the Post would have become merely
the hysterical spokesman for the
equally hysterical left wing of the
Democratic Party--

The SOUND of the teletype doesnt stop in this little part
and we see three people and its very important that their
voices are immediately recognizable and distinct One the
SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang The next
two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE
from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE The CREEP voice is very
southern the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer
The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate
office building talking to reporters the CREEP PR
SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP
office doors and so identified The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to

one side

As the teletype goes on--

CUT TO

THE SOUTHERN CREEP PR MAN

THE WHITE

BRADLEES

CREEP PR MAN
(in mid-sentence)
--hearsay innuendo and character
assassination I can only conclude
that the so-called sources of the
Washington Post are a fountain of
misinformation--

CUT TO
HOUSE SPOKESMAN
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
--the White House has long since
stopped being surprised at this type
of reporting by certain elements of
the Eastern liberal press--

CUT TO

OFFICE

A lot of activity BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype
dispatches SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there WOODWARD and

BERNSTEIN

too A kid comes in with more teletype stuff The

editors look at it

SIMONS
(reading)
Same kind of crap--

BRADLEE
(glancing through
nods)
--all non-denial denials--were dirty
guys and they doubt we were ever
virgins but they dont say the story
is inaccurate

BERNSTEIN
Whats a real denial

BRADLEE
If they ever start calling us goddamn
liars--
(little pause)
--its time to start circling the
wagons
CUT TO
THE UNION GUYS IN THE POST
looking at a new headline
NIXON ELECTION AIDES CONCEALED FACTS FROM GOVERNMENT PROBERS

FIRST UNION GUY
You think they know what theyre
doing on the fifth floor

SECOND UNION GUY
I got eight kids to support--they
better

They start for the sports section only this time they stop
go back stare at the headline again From them watching--

CUT TO

SIMONS

walking WOODWARD to the elevators

WOODWARD
What do you think Mrs Graham wants
to see me for

SIMONS

Maybe to fire you--since you two
started on this story the Post stock
has dropped what 50 percent

(WOODWARD pushes for

the elevator)
And the word is some Nixon people
are challenging her TV licenses Im
not saying shes going on relief
but I dont think its unreasonable
for her to want to meet you

WOODWARD
You think she wants us to ease up on
the story

SIMONS
(shrugs)
I dont know but I dont think thats
unreasonable either do you

The elevator opens WOODWARD shakes his head no and steps
inside as we

CUT TO
MRS GRAHAM in her office as a SECRETARY lets WOODWARD in
Hes nervous Shes standing by the window he crosses to
her

MRS GRAHAM
Im so glad you could come Mr--

WOODWARD
--Im Woodward

She nods Theres a pause He waits Shes trying to say
something get something started but its difficult Silence
She stares out again quietly starts to talk

MRS GRAHAM

You know the paper was my fathers
and my husbands when they were alive
and I was thinking back a year or
two ago when Ben called me and said
he wanted to publish the Pentagon
Papers the next day The Times had
already been stopped from publishing
anymore of them and all my legal
counsel said dont dont and I
was frightened but I knew if I said
no Id lose the whole fifth floor
So we published and that night
after Id told Ben to go ahead I
woke up in the darkness and I thought
Oh my Lord what am I doing to this
newspaper

(She looks at WOODWARD)
I woke up again last night with that
same question

(WOODWARD says nothing

waits)
Are we right on this story

WOODWARD
I think so

MRS GRAHAM
Are you sure

WOODWARD
No

MRS GRAHAM
When will you be do you think--
when are we going to know it all

WOODWARD
It may never come out

MRS GRAHAM
Never Please dont tell me never
(beat)
Ben says youve found some wonderful
sources

WOODWARD
Some Justice Department lawyers and
an FBI man and some people from the
Committee to Re-Elect yes maam

MRS GRAHAM
And the underground garage one
(WOODWARD more nervous
now nods)
Would I know him

WOODWARD
I couldnt say

MRS GRAHAM
But its possible

WOODWARD
(throat very dry)
It is

MRS GRAHAM
Youve never told anyone who he is
(WOODWARD shakes his

head)
But youd have to tell me if I asked
you

(WOODWARD nods)
Tell me

WOODWARD
(he is dying)
I would if you really ever wanted
to know

MRS GRAHAM
I really want to know

CUT TO

WOODWARD caught between a rock and a hard place He is silent
until there is the SOUND of light laughter and we--

CUT TO
MRS GRAHAM The laughter came from her
MRS GRAHAM
I wasnt serious I have plenty of
burdens to carry around I dont

need another

WOODWARD tries not to exhale too audibly
MRS GRAHAM
Were going to need lots of good
luck arent we

WOODWARD
Nobody ever had too much

CUT TO

CLOSE UP--MRS GRAHAM as abruptly she reaches out touches
WOODWARD on the arm

MRS GRAHAM
Do better

WOODWARD makes a nod HOLD Then--
CUT TO
BRADLEE

in a state of anger pacing around the tiny teletype room
WOODWARD hurries in

WOODWARD
What

BRADLEE says nothing just points to the AP teletype WOODWARD
looks at it clearly is upset

BRADLEE
I thought you guys were supposed to
be working on this story--
(to BERNSTEIN who
tears in--)
--you think I like being aced out

BERNSTEIN
--what--

WOODWARD
--The LA Times has a huge interview
with Baldwin--

BERNSTEIN
--the lookout in the Motor Inn--
(WOODWARD nods)
--he say anything we dont know--

WOODWARD
(headshake)
--just that a lot of reports were
sent to CREEP but he doesnt name
who not here anyway--

BRADLEE
--it would have been nice to have
had this I sure would have li
have had this--

BERNSTEIN
--theres nothing new in it--

BRADLEE
--it makes the break-in real--
major goddamn story--
(starts out)

ked to

its a

--Im not going to kick ass over
this but Id like you to know I

hate getting beat I just hate
dont forget that I hate it--

it--

And he stalks out WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand staring at
the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the

LA Times story keeps getting longer

BERNSTEIN
Goddamnit--

WOODWARD
--shit--

BERNSTEIN

--we gotta top the Times--

WOODWARD
--I know I know--

BERNSTEIN
--if we could name the guys go
reports wed be ahead again--

WOODWARD
--shit who do we know--

BERNSTEIN
--I know a lawyer at Justice--

WOODWARD
--has he got an ax--

BERNSTEIN
--almost every source weve us
been Republican this guys a
carrying Democrat

WOODWARD
Then hes got an ax
(beat)
Call him anyway

As BERNSTEIN nods takes off out of the

t the

ed has
card-

room-â€”

Cur

TO
THE UNION GUYS

studying the front page on which one headline indicates
that theyre named the guys at CREEP who got the reports

FIRST UNION GUY
Who is this Woodstein
(points to paper)
Two stories on the front page

SECOND UNION GUY
If he cant pick a winner at Pimlico
to hell with him

A HOT SHOPPE

WOODWARD is stirring his morning coffee as BERNSTEIN
in spots him hurries over BERNSTEIN is maybe more
then weve yet seen him

BERNSTEIN
--I want you to shut up and listen
to me--

WOODWARD

--I havent said anything--

BERNSTEIN

--for the first time Im beginning
to feel like a fucking reporter--
Woodward I got a tip A guy called
me up with a tip--

(carefully)
--someone named Donald Segretti
contacted a bunch of lawyers and
asked them if theyd like to go to
work with him screwing up the
Democrats dirty tricks shit like
that The FBI knows about Segretti--
Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone
calls to him--they interrogated him
but on account of Segretti wasnt
involved with the break-in they
didnt follow through But Segretti
did a lot of traveling--he called
these lawyers from different places
and he told them the Republicans
knew what he was doing

WOODWARD
How high up which Republicans

BERNSTEIN
Thats what weve got to find out

CUT TO

comes
excited
but Segretti went to Southern Cal
and so did a bunch of Nixon men--

WOODWARD
--Haldeman I know who else

BERNSTEIN
Dwight Chapin Nixons appointments
chief--he knew Segretti in school
Maybe Im crazy but this is the
first time any of this starts to
make sense What were the three
theories

WOODWARD
The burglary was done by Cubans or
Democrats or Republicans

BERNSTEIN
Now the reason no one believed the
Republicans is because there wasnt
any reason they were so far ahead
But Segretti was talking to these
other lawyers a year before the break-
in

WOODWARD
So maybe Watergate wasnt really
about Watergate--maybe that was just
a piece--

BERNSTEIN
--because a year before the
Republicans werent ahead not in
the polls Muskie was running ahead
of Nixon then Before he self-
destructed

WOODWARD
If he self-destructed

Now from the two of them--

CUT TO
A MAZE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS IN VARIOUS PILES
There is the SOUND of bad guitar music which as we
PULL BACK
we see is BERNSTEIN playing We are in his apartment its
night and the two of them bleary are studying the maze of

receipts

WOODWARD
Segretti criss-crossed the country
over ten times in six months--and
never stayed anyplace over a night
or two

(glancing up)
Switch to another station huh Youre
driving me crazy with that

BERNSTEIN
Segovia begged me for me secret but
I said No Andres youll have to
try and make it without me

He switches to another song which sounds a lot like the one
he just finished playing

WOODWARD

(pointing to the

thickest stacks)
California Illinois Florida New
Hampshire--all the major Democratic
primary states

(whirling)
Why does everything you play sound
the same

BERNSTEIN
--cause I only know four chords--â€”

CUT TO

THE CREDIT CARDS The camera moves across the travels of
Donald Segretti There is the SOUND of BERNSTEINs guitar
HOLD for a moment then--

CUT TO
TINY BABY-FACED MAN
standing in his doorway
BERNSTEIN (V0O)
Donald Segretti
SEGRETTI
Thats right
CUT TO

BERNSTEIN--OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT DOOR We are it will soon
be clear in California now Marina Del Rey

BERNSTEIN
Im Carl Bernstein
(SEGRETTI nods)
My paper sent me out to see if I
couldnt persuade you to go on the
record
SEGRETTI
You cant

BERNSTEIN
Mind if I try

SEGRETTI shrugs and as they enter his apartment--â€”

INSIDE They walk across to a small terrace outside

they sit

He waits

CUT TO

where

The terrace has a glorious view of the water and
lots of girls in bathing costume below

BERNSTEIN
According to what weve been able to
verify youve been busy

SEGRETTI
Ive got a lot of energy

BERNSTEIN
Listen--we know youre involved in
this--were going to get the story
why not help

SEGRETTI
They never told me anything except
my own role--I had to find out the
rest in the papers

BERNSTEIN
By they you mean

SEGRETTI just shakes his head

BERNSTEIN
By they you mean the White House
dont you
(SEGRETTI makes no
reply)
Your buddy from USC Dwight Chapin--
he works for the White House

SEGRETTI
I know where Dwight works

BERNSTEIN
When did he hire you

SEGRETTI shakes his head stares out at the girls

BERNSTEIN
Do you feel much about the things
you did
BERNSTEIN

SEGRETTI
I didnt do anything wrong

BERNSTEIN
Tell that to Muskie

SEGRETTI
Oh maybe nickel and dime stuff

BERNSTEIN
During the Florida primary you wrote
a letter on Muskie stationery saying
Scoop Jackson had a bastard child
You wrote another that said Hubert
Humphrey was out with call girls

SEGRETTI
Sometimes it got up to a quarter
maybe--
(to BERNSTEIN)
--off the record

BERNSTEIN
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one
where you claimed Muskie slurred the
Canadians

SEGRETTI
I didnt

BERNSTEIN
But you know who did

SEGRETTI
When you guys print it in the paper
then Ill know
(closes his eyes)
Im a lawyer and Ill probably go
to jail and be disbarred and what
did I do that was so awful

says nothing waits
SEGRETTI
None of it was my idea Carl--I didnt

go looking for the job

BERNSTEIN
Chapin did contact you then

SEGRETTI
Sure--off the record

BERNSTEIN
On the orders of Haldeman

SEGRETTI
I dont know anything about Haldeman
except Dwights frightened of him--
everybodys frightened of him--Christ
I wish Id never gotten messed around
with this--all I wanna do is sit in
the sun sit swim see some girls

BERNSTEIN
It gets interesting if it was
Haldeman because our word is that
when Chapin says something hes
gotten the OK from Haldeman and
when Haldeman says something hes
gotten the OK from the President

SEGRETTI
Cant help you

BERNSTEIN

At USC you had a word the this--
screwing up the opposition you all
did it at college and called it
ratfucking

(SEGRETTI half-smiles

nods)
Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out
to be the biggest ratfucker of them
all

CUT TO
CLOSE UP--SEGRETTI staring at the girls and the blue water

SEGRETTI
What would you have done if you were
just getting out of the Army if
youd been away from the real world
for four years if you werent sure
what kind of law you wanted to
practice and then one day you got a
call from an old friend asking you
to go to work for the President of
the United States

HOLD on the question then--

CUT TO
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN
back in DC walking through the airport

BERNSTEIN
What would you have done

WOODWARD
You asking would I have been one of
the Presidents men
(beat)
I would have been

As they continue on--
CUT TO
WOODWARD

alone in the underground garage Tense jumpy He looks at
his watch paces around Its all eerie as hell Then from
the ramps footsteps

CUT TO
DEEP THROAT moving out of the shadows smoking as always

DEEP THROAT
My turn to keep you waiting
(approaches)
Whats the topic for tonight

WOODWARD
Ratfucking

DEEP THROAT
In my day it was simply called the
double cross I believe the CIA refers
to it as Mindfuck In our context
it simply means infiltration of the
Democrats

WOODWARD
I know what it means--Segretti
wouldnt go on the record but if he
would we know hed implicate Chapin
And that would put us inside the
White House

DEEP THROAT
(nods)
Yes the little ratfuckers are now
running our government

WOODWARD
Who--be specific How high up

DEEP THROAT
Youll have to find that out wont
you

WOODWARD
The slush fund at CREEP financed the
ratfucking weve almost got that
nailed down so--
He stops as suddenly DEEP THROAT dives down behind the nearest
car

WOODWARD dropping beside him

WOODWARD
What

DEEP THROAT
Did you change cabs
(as WOODWARD nods)
It didnt work something moved there--
And as he points

CUT TO

THE SHADOWS BY THE RAMP You cant see a goddamn thing But
there is the SOUND faint but distinct of breathing

CUT TO
WOODWARD standing staring into the darkness He is scared
wipes his mouth He doesnt move for a moment Then he walks
directly into the darkness and as hes gone--

ZOOM TO
A HORRID FACE IN CLOSE UP red eyed unshaven beaten--there
are half-formed scabs and cuts He is leaning against a wall
shivering He looks for all the world like a perpetual
drunk

CUT TO
WOODWARD in the shadows coming closer

CUT TO

THE DRUNK He blinks slowly tongue lolling outside his mouth
He watches WOODWARD approach

CUT TO
WOODWARD coming still closer
CUT TO

THE DRUNK He blinks very slowly now Maybe he isnt even
certain WOODWARDs there

CUT TO

WOODWARD stopping in front of the drunk They look at each
other for a long time Then

WOODWARD
Who are you

CUT TO
THE DRUNK Nothing no reaction

CUT TO
WOODWARD studying the other man

CUT TO

THE DRUNK And he blinks again then slowly shivering begins
sliding down the wall WOODWARD reaches for him holds him

up
CUT TO
WOODWARD managing to get out his wallet take out some bills

He starts up the ramp with the drunk and as they disappear
up the ramp out of sight he gives the drunk the money

WOODWARD
Here
(softly)
Forget your troubles and just be
happy

CUT TO

DEEP THROAT pacing and smoking He is visibly upset scared
maybe He glances over as WOODWARD comes back down the ramp
alone

DEEP THROAT
(self-mocking)
I hope you noticed how coolly I
behaved under the threat of discovery

WOODWARD
(impatiently)
Do Justice and the FBI know what we
know and why the hell havent they
done anything about it

DEEP THROAT
They know but they focused on the
burglary--if it didnt deal with the
break-in they didnt pursue it

WOODWARD
Why didnt they--who told them not
to

DEEP THROAT
Someone with authority Id imagine
wouldnt you
(coughs)
Dont you know what youre onto
Come on

WOODWARD
Mitchell knew then

DEEP THROAT
Of course--my God you think something
this big just happens The break-in
and the cover up of course Mitchell
knew but no more than Ehrlichman

WOODWARD
Haldeman too

DEEP THROAT
You get nothing from me about
Haldeman

And from this tone you know HALDEMAN scares him

WOODWARD
Why did they do all this for
Chrissakes--what were they after

DEEP THROAT
Total manipulation I suppose you
could say they wanted to subvert the
Constitution but they dont think
along philosophical lines

WOODWARD
Talk about Segretti--

DEEP THROAT
--dont concentrate on Segretti or
youll miss the overall scheme too

WOODWARD
There were more then

DEEP THROAT
Follow every lead--every lead goes
somewhere-â€”-

WOODWARD
--the Canuck letter--was that a White
House operation--

DEEP THROAT
(nods bigger)
--dont you miss the grand scheme
too

WOODWARD
How grand
DEEP THROAT
Nationwide--my God they were
frightened of Muskie and look who
got destroyed--they wanted to run
against McGovern and look who theyre
running against They bugged they
followed people false press leaks
fake letters they canceled Democratic
campaign rallies they investigated
Democratic private lives they planted
spies stole documents on and on--
dont tell me you think this was all
the work of little Don Segretti

WOODWARD
And Justice and FBI know all this

DEEP THROAT
Yes yes everything There were
over fifty people employed by the
White House and CREEP to ratfuck--
some of what they did is beyond
belief

WOODWARD
(stunned)
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the
White House to destroy the Democrats

CUT TO
DEEP THROAT
DEEP THROAT
I was being cautious
(inhales)
You can safely say more then fifty
SILENCE in the garage HOLD then--
CUT TO

THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE POST

and its noisy Not as noisy as its going to get but there
is more tension around just now than there has been
previously

CUT TO

AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER MID-30s On her desk is her name
MARILYN BERGER She is watching BERNSTEIN who is standing by
the water cooler nearby As she gets up--

CUT TO
BERNSTEIN drinking water

BERGER
Do you guys know about the Canuck
letter

BERNSTEIN
(nods drinks)
Um-hmm
(stops looks at her)
Why

BERGER
I just wanted to be sure you knew
who wrote it

As she speaks--
CUT TO

WOODWARD working at his desk suddenly looking up as a SCREAM
comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone
turns to see here comes BERNSTEIN dragging BERGER over to
WOODWARDs desk

BERNSTEIN
(hysterical)
Tell him what you just told me

BERGER

Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be
a reporter here before he went to
work for Nixon--I had him over for a
drink a few weeks ago and he told me
he wrote the Canuck letter

(she looks from one

of them to the other)
You did want to know didnt you

And now from her--
CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN in a corner of the room talking low
and fast

BERNSTEIN
You think were being set up--Christ
Deep Throat tells you last night
that the letter came from inside the
White House and up traipses Marilyn
naming names

WOODWARD
It makes a crazy kind of sense--
remember that initiation rite they
have at the White House Each new
member of the Presidents staff has
to prove his guts by getting an enemy
of Nixon

BERNSTEIN
You think this was Clawsens
initiation

WOODWARD
Could have won him a fraternity paddle
with a White House seal
(beat)
God knows it worked

CUT TO

A FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears standing on
the flat-bed truck This was in the New Hampshire primary

at her desk--

WOODWARD

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN heading toward the office As they

BRADLEE

BRADLEE

WOODWARD

A BIG HEADLINE IN THE POST READING NIXON AIDES SABOTAGED
DEMOCRATS

Now we HOLD on that headline as the three deniers are visible
through it in the same places they spoke before

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
The story is based entirely on hearsay
and--

CREEP PR MAN
--we at the Committee are continually
amazed at the creativity shown by
And now

the Washington Post--

WESTERN SENATOR
--although I am a Republican I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit that I am happy that this

Its a very fancy restaurant and BRADLEE is at a corner table
as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sit down They are exhausted

BRADLEE
Look I wanted to talk because things
are getting really hairy and theres
a couple of things weve got to be
careful of because--

A waiter is nearby

BRADLEE
--either of you want a drink or should
I order--
(They dont)
--because--

And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter
ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes

BRADLEE
--because our cocks are on the
chopping block and youve got to be
sure that youre not just dealing
with people who hate Richard Nixon
and want to get him through us You
see I dont give a shit whos
President--I really dont its an
adversary situation between them and
us and its always gonna be I never
had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy
and once I printed something that
pissed him off and for seven months
I didnt exist

A wine steward appears hands BRADLEE the list As he examines
it a man walks up to the table stands there

name They showed him a list and he
picked me but it wasnt me it was
Gordon Liddy

nod)

BRADLEE

guys had control--

BERNSTEIN
(ticking them off)
--Mitchell Stans Magruder Kalmbach--

WOODWARD
--were working on the last guy now
and were going all the way--that
fifth man was Haldeman

SLOAN
--Im not your source on that--

BERNSTEIN
--its gotta be Haldeman--someone
from the White House had to be
involved--

WOODWARD
--and it wasnt Ehrlichman or Colson
or the President

SLOAN
No none of those

BERNSTEIN
--that leaves Haldeman period

SLOAN
Im not your source on that

He picks up a dust pan starts sweeping it full

WOODWARD
(taking the dust pan
helping out)
--look when the Watergate grand
jury questioned you did you name

SLOAN
Of course--everything they asked--

BERNSTEIN
--if we wrote a story that said
Haldeman controlled the fund--

SLOAN

most important man in America of
conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House--

WOODWARD

BERNSTEIN talking softly from a relatively private phone in

scared to death

LAWYERS VOICE (0S)

BERNSTEIN

mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury

LAWYERS VOICE (0S)

BERNSTEIN
(desperate)

THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
On the record let me say just this

NOW FAST ZOOM TO

BRADLEE

roaring out of his office doorway

BRADLEE
Woodstein

CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN tearing into BRADLEEs office--he
stands scowling at the TV set in a corner of the room--
outside it is raining like hell

CUT TO

THE TV SET SLOAN is walking along toward a large office
building he is flanked by a lawyer A TV Reporter (it was
DANIEL SCHORR) is walking alongside mike in hand

SCHORR
Mr Sloan would you care to comment
on your testimony before the Grand
Jury

SLOAN
My lawyer says--

SLOANS LAWYER
--the answer is an unequivocal no
Mr Sloan did not implicate Mr
Haldeman in that testimony at all

CUT TO

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN They look sick Desperate tired
stunned confused there is nothing to say

CUT TO
BRADLEE glaring at them HOLD ON BRADLEE then

CUT TO
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
in the rain and

CUT TO

A CORRIDOR IN THE BUILDING AS THE PUDGY FBI MAN retreats
down the hall WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN soaked chase after
him
FBI MAN
--Ill deny everything--everything--
I never talked to you about Haldeman--
I never talked to you about anything--
Im not talking to you now--

BERNSTEIN
--what went wrong--

WOODWARD
--for Chrissakes just tell that--

PUDGY FBI MAN
--fuck you fuck you fuck you--

And he tears into an office slams the door and as we hear
it lock--

CUT TO

THIS IS WHERE THE SOURCE BURNING SCENE WOULD COME BUT I AM
NOT WRITING IT FOR THIS VERSION

My reasons are as follows it is a complicated long scene
to put down we are terribly late in our story it
would mean here two hours into the movie we are bringing
in an entirely new character the FBI agents head to whom
they go and I think that is unnecessary and confusing and most important I think the characters have been abused
enough in this version--we have added the Sedam scene and
they are berated more in this version by the CREEP people
before things turn Finally all this can show in reality
is that they are desperate and I would rather let the actors
give that to us I feel that it would be a genuine error at
this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how
its bad manners for a reporter to burn a source if weve
got anything going by this point I cant conceive of much

an audience will be less interested in than the reporters
misbehaving

However if the scene is requested next time through I shall
be only too happy to oblige

What I would like to do is cut from the FBI saying fuck you
fuck you fuck you and locking his door to the following

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN walking in the rain Its pouring as
they leave FBI Headquarters and they are in anguish

BERNSTEIN
(after a while)
Woodward
WOODWARD

Hmm
BERNSTEIN
What was the mistake Do you think
its been rigged all along the way
leading us on so they could slip it
to us when it mattered They couldnt
have set us up better after all
these months our credibilitys gone
you know what that means

WOODWARD
(nods)
Only everything

They are soaked Nearby is a garbage can they grab papers
hold them over their heads start to walk Now--

CAMERA MOVES UP HIGHER TO REVEAL

The papers they grabbed were the Post front page (This
happened) And as they walked the Haldeman story was on
their heads HOLD on the reporters walking miserably through
the rain Now--

CUT TO
THE POST

A tremendous pall has settled on the city room People walk
by glancing at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN who sit almost
immobilized at their desks wet whipped no energy left

CUT TO

BRADLEES OFFICE SIMONS sits across from BRADLEE as ROSENFELD
enters quietly with a bundle of teletype paper

SIMONS
(indicating the papers
More denunciations

ROSENFELD
(nods)
One Senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes

BRADLEE has started typing something brief When ROSENFELDs
done so is he He hands it to SIMONS

SIMONS

BRADLEE
My non-denial denial

ROSENFELD

BERNSTEIN
You overslept

WOODWARD
Goddamnit--

He fumbles for the lamp as it falls with a CRASH--
CUT TO

WOODWARD--MOVING Hair wild clothes half-buttoned he runs
through the dark Washington streets as we

CUT TO

TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN in the shadows across the street going
in the same direction and

CUT TO
WOODWARD spotting them picking up the pace and
CUT TO

THE TWO MEN moving faster too and now
CUT TO

A BUNCH OF CABS WOODWARD jumps into the first and as it
roars off

CUT TO

THE TWO MEN getting into a cab also roaring off in the same
direction and

CUT TO

WOODWARDS CAB taking a corner fast and as it goes on HOLD
until the second cab takes the same corner faster and now

CUT TO

WOODWARD jumping out of his cab fumbling into his pockets
for change as we

CUT TO

THE TWO MEN getting out of their cab paying and as their
cab drives off

CUT TO

WOODWARD diving back into his cab and in a moment it is
roaring again through the night and we

CUT TO

THE TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN standing on the sidewalk watching
as WOODWARD disappears into the night and then suddenly

ZOOM TO
DEEP THROAT IN CLOSE UP AND MAD

DEEP THROAT
--you were doing so well and then
you got stupid you went too fast--
Christ what a royal screw up--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
DEEP THROAT and WOODWARD in the underground garage

WOODWARD
--I know I know the pressures off
the White House and its all back on
the Post--

DEEP THROAT
--youve done worse than let Haldeman
slip away youve got people feeling
sorry for him--I didnt think that
was possible A conspiracy like this--
the rope has to tighten slowly around
everyones neck You build from the
outer edges and you go step by step
If you shoot too high and miss then
everybody feels more secure Youve
put the investigation back months

WOODWARD
We know that--and if we were wrong
were resigning--were we wrong

DEEP THROAT
Youll have to find that out wont

you--
CUT TO
WOODWARD exploding
WOODWARD
--Im tired of your chickenshit games--
I dont want hints I want what you
know
CUT TO

DEEP THROAT He blinks for a moment Then he begins to
whisper

DEEP THROAT
It was a Haldeman operation--the
whole business--he ran the money
but he was insulated youll have to
find out how--

WOODWARD takes a breath nods
DEEP THROAT
--wait--
(almost a smile)
--theres more
And from his weathered face
CUT TO

WOODWARD

walking up to his apartment house later that night He sees
and then we see BERNSTEIN asleep at the front door He
comes awake as WOODWARD approaches

WOODWARD
We gotta go see Bradlee--Ill fill
you in in the car
CUT TO
BRADLEE IN HIS DOORWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Its a house with a lawn and from somewhere there is the
SOUND of dogs barking

BRADLEE
You couldnt have told me over the
phone

CUT TO
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN moving up the walk to BRADLEE

WOODWARD
We cant trust the phones not
anymore Deep Throat says so

As WOODWARD beckons for him to move out into the lawn--

BRADLEE
We cant talk inside either

WOODWARD
(headshake)
Electronic surveillance

CUT TO

THE THREE OF THEM MOVING OUT ONTO THE LAWN Its October
now You can see their breaths as they speak

BERNSTEIN
I finally got through to Sloan--it
was all a misunderstanding that we
had he would have told the Grand
Jury about Haldeman he was ready
to only nobody on the Grand Jury
asked him the goddamn question

WOODWARD
So I guess you could say that we
screwed up but we werent wrong

BRADLEE
Anything else from Mr Throat

WOODWARD

Mitchell started the cover-up early
everyone is involved in the cover-
up all the way to the top The whole
US intelligence community is mixed
in with the covert activities The
extent of it is incredible

(little pause)
And peoples lives are in danger
maybe including ours
CUT TO

BRADLEE He nods again starts walking the two reporters
back toward WOODWARDs car

BRADLEE
Hes wrong on that last were not
in the least danger because nobody
gives a shit--what was that Gallup
Poll result Half the countrys never
even heard the word Watergate

CUT TO
THE RED KARMANN GHIA as the three approach

BRADLEE

Look youre both probably a little
tired right

(They nod)
You should be youve been under a
lot of pressure So go home have a
nice hot bath rest up fifteen minutes
if you want before you get your asses
back in gear--

(louder now)
--because were under a lot of
pressure too and you put us there--
not that I want it to worry you--
nothings riding on you except the
First Amendment of the Constitution
plus the freedom of the press plus
the reputation of a hundred-year-old
paper plus the jobs of the two
thousand people who work there--

(still building)
--but none of that counts as much as
this you fuck up again Im gonna
lose my temper

(pause softer)
I promise you you dont want me to
lose my temper

(shooing them off)
Move-move-move--what have you done
for me tomorrow

And as they get back into the car--

CUT TO
THE NEWSROOM--EARLY MORNING
and its empty pretty much except at their desks sit WOODWARD

and BERNSTEIN typing away They type on and on and as they
do voices are HEARD the same voices weve become familiar
with the WESTERN SENATOR the CREEP PR MAN and the WHITE
HOUSE SPOKESMAN

WESTERN SENATOR (0S)
Although Im a Republican I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan
spirit tht the greatest political
scandal of this campaign is the brazen
manner in which without benefit of
clergy the Washington Post has set
up housekeeping with the McGovern
campaign

CREEP PR MAN
For twenty years the Eastern liberal
press has been trying to smear Dick
Nixon Fortunately the American
public is too smart to be fooled
by

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
I have been informed reliably by
John Dean that no one connected with
the White House

WESTERN SENATOR

(coming in overlapping)
It is only our pathetic Post that
deliberately tries to infuse the
Watergate caper with a seriousness
far beyond those shenanigans that
have been the stock trade of political
pranksters ever since

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN work on And now as the voices
continue condemning we see them--all the Presidents men--
as their faces flash on the screen for an instant--only these
arent fashion portraits were looking at these are the mug
shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash
on the mug shots and the name and across each the word
CONVICTED Theres VIRGILIO GONZALES--CONVICTED and EUGENIO
MARTINEZ CONVICTED and FRANK STURGIS CONVICTED and BERNARD
BARKER CONVICTED and JAMES McCORD CONVICTED and HOWARD
HUNT CONVICTED and GORDON LIDDY CONVICTED and DONALD
SEGRETTI CONVICTED and DWIGHT CHAPIN CONVICTED and now
the denunciations are louder shriller briefer

WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
An insult to the American public--

CREEP PR MAN
--the deplorable tactics employed by
the Washington Post--

WESTERN SENATOR
--I have been given access to evidence
in possession of the White House and
that evidence--

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN type on Their machines are the only
SOUND in the enormous room And now more mug shots appear--

JEB MAGRUDER CONVICTED EGIL KROGH CONVICTED JOHN DEAN
CONVICTED JOHN EHRLICHMAN CONVICTED CHARLES COLSON
CONVICTED HERBERT KALMBACH CONVICTED and LARUE and PORTER
and MITCHELL and HALDEMAN--all all the Presidents men--
CONVICTED Now--

THE CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE toward the pillar the one that
separates the two reporters and the denunciations are still
going on but not so loud now not so fierce

WESTERN SENATOR
Well if I was wrong I sure the
hell wasnt alone--

CREEP
--the fact remains that except for
Watergate we ran one hell of a great
campaign

The CAMERA is almost at the pillar now

BERNSTEIN bums a cigarette from a cleaning lady WOODWARD
kicks his typewriter Then they both go back to work

Now were at the pillar Thats all we see Just that And
all we HEAR is the two reporters working away on and on
until--

FINAL FADE OUT

THE END
