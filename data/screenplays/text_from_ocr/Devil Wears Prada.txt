FADE IN

INT CHATEAU -- FRANCE -- DAY

An elegant 17th Century mansion a short distance from Paris A
dinner is set for about a hundred people Everything is perfect

exquisite flowers linens silver

Anyone wha’s anyone in the fashion world is there We see
Lagerfeld Valentino Marc Jacobs

NIGEL KIPLING a dapper man in his late 30‘searly 40s speaks

‘at a podium at the center of the dais on one side of the room

Our POV is from someone else on the dais so we see NIGEL from
the back

NIGEL
«eher name has become legend Her
magazine is the Bible for anyone
interested in style taste and
sophistication Without a doubt one of
the most elegant women ever to walk
the planet I give you Miranda
Priestly

Loud applause rings out And from the backwe see MIRANDA
PRIESTLY approaching the podium We can only make out her fancy
updo the curves of her couture gown

As MIRANDA lingers taking in the applause

We reverse to see whose point of view we are watching from

-ANDY BARNES 20’s pretty elegantly put together She stands
a few feet behind MIRANDA

She applauds smiling Some of MIRANDA’S light spills onto ANDY

MIRANDA starts to talk and we hear a brief SCREECH of feedback
The SCREECH dissolves into

FLASH BACK TO
EXT MIDTOWN STREET - DAY

--the SCREECH of a taxi rounding a corner

Six months earlier ANDY walks out of a subway station
elutching a piece of paper with directions on it-

ANDY looks nothing like the polished young woman from the
chateau Her hair and makeup are college student simple She
wears her best -- white shirt blue skirt comfortable shoes
Morning rush hour pedestrians bustle past She checks her paper

ANDY
Two blocks to 57th

EXT 57TH STREET -- DAY
She looks up at an address 125 She walks in

A GUARD quickly stops her Indicates she should sign his
clipboard which she does

ANDY
What floor is Elias-Clarke

Beat The GUARD just looks at her Her heart starts to pound

ANDY (cont’d)
Don’t Don’t tell me

GUARD
Honey you want West 57th

EXT 57TH STREET - DAY
ANDY busts out of the wrong building and starts to run but--

--she‘s moving against the pedestrian tide We widen out to’ see
ANDY bucking the flow of people like a salmon going upstream

She gets to an intersection starts to cross the street

-and just misses being decked by a bike messenger He flips
her off She barely hesitates starts running again

EXT 57TH STREET -- DAY
ANDY is looking at numbers

And she sees looming in front of her an elegant tower Elias-
Clarke 125 She runs toward it

INT ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

ANDY trots into the building out of breath and stops
overwhelmed by what she sees

The lobby looms around her The place is so big so unto
itself it probably rains in here

INT HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE -- DAY

ANDY sits across from a bored looking woman SHERRY
On the wall behind SHERRY are framed covers from all the Elias-
Clarke magazines -- a news magazine a cooking Magazine a
fitness magazine and Runway

SHERRY clicks away on her computer

ANDY
Thank you for replying to my query
letter I’m very excited about the
opportunity to--

SHERRY
You like race cars

Huh

ANDY
Actually for me it’s a toss up
between race cars and monster trucks

SHERRY
I have two openings -- one at Auto
Universe and one at Runway

ANDY
The fashion magazine But—-

SHERRY
Thats it That’s what we have

ANDY
What if I come back next week

SHERRY
Might have nothing at all

INT RUNWAY RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Sleek elegant hard-edged chic Behind a large reception desk

is an elegant logo that says RUNWAY
ANDY walks over to the desk

ANDY
I’m here about the assistant job

The RECEPTIONIST points her towards a seating area

--where there are a few other women waiting each a tall thin
dressed to kill PEMBOT

ANDY tries to smile at one of them who looks away ANDY sits ©
She can hear two of the other WOMAN chatting softly
GIRL 1
I can’t believe I’m even in this
office

GIRL 2

Oh I know I would murder my best
friend to get this job

EXT RECEPTION -- LATER

ANDY is trying to arrange herself on the uncomfortable sofa when
suddenly a taller thinner and amazingly more groomed version
of the women in the room walks in

This is EMILY who looks the part of the sleek fashionista but
is propelled by a core of barely tamped down anxiety

EMILY
Um Andrea Barnes

EMILY looks up Their eyes meet As EMILY takes in how different
ANDY looks from everyone else

»-ANDY springs up and follows her down the hallway
INT RUNWAY -- DAY 4
EMILY walks ANDY down the hall

EMTLY
Who put you up for this job

ANDY
Human Resources sent me

EMILY
They do have an odd sense of humor

At the end of a long corridor is a bullpen -- two desks outside
a large corner office

ANDY can only see part of the corner office but it is
seductively bright sending light streaming into the bullpen

ANDY and EMILY sit down

EMILY (cont‘d)
Miranda has two assistants -- Im the
first and were interviewing for the
second junior assistant
(pauses dramatic) oo
Miranda is an amazing woman a legend 4
(MORE )
EMILY (cont’d)
Working for her sets you up to work
anywhere in publishing A million
girls would kill for this job

ANDY
Sounds great

EMILY
The thing is Andy we are a fashion
Magazine and an interest in fashion is
crucial

ANDY
What makes you think I’m not
“interested in fashion

EMILY gives her a look Suddenly EMILY‘S Blackberry goes off

She gasps

EMILY
Oh my God No No no no

ANDY
What’s wrong

EXT ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

A black sedan pulls to a sudden stop outside the building
INT RUNWAY-- DAY

EMILY springs to her feet

EMILY
What the hell is she doing here

She begins rapid-fire dialing four digit extensions
EMILY (cont‘d)
(all but screaming)
Shes on her way -- tell everyone
Just then NIGEL looking dapper as usual rushes over to EMILY
EMILY (cont’ a)
Her driver text-messaged Her colorist
has the flu
NIGEL turns and calls out to the office

NIGEL
Man your battle stations
He runs down the hall popping in Altoids and brushing himself
with a lint roller at the same time

EXT ELIAS-CLARKE - DAY

The sedan door opens We see more flashes of MIRANDA

---2000 crocodile Manolos Chanel jacket perfect hair
fabulous Harry Winston earrings

INT ELIAS-CLARKE - DAY
Everyone is in a high state of alert
ASSISTANTS frantically push clothing racks out of the way

EDITORS race into their office

ANDY peers in sees one of the EDITORS changing from kitten
heels to sky-high stilettos

--sees another curling her lashes

--another lining her lips

-another pulls on a body shaper under her dress
INT ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY

We watch MIRANDA -- still only a partial view of her -- click-
clacking through the lobby in her 4-inch-heels

And we see PEOPLE reacting to her

GUARDS ASSISTANTS and SECRETARIES cower DISTINGUISHED
EXECUTIVES bow their heads in respectful greeting

MIRANDA maintains a high rate of speed towards the elevator

As she’s about to get in she sees a lowly EDITORIAL ASSISTANT in
the elevator He immediately leaps out

EDITORIAL ASSISTANT
Sorry Ms Priestly

She doesn’t acknowledge his existence Her perfectly manicured
finger presses one of the buttons

INT RUNWAY DAY

EMILY looks around to see if everythings perfect Notices ANDY
EMILY
Oh my God You’re still here Go

ANDY gets up

EMILY (cont‘d)
No stay I don’t want you walking
past her Just sit there and I‘1l pray
she doesn’t notice you marring the
area

ANDY sits
ANDY
(to herself)
‘Wow this is like selfesteem camp

INT RUNWAY --— DAY

MIRANDA steps out of the elevator and for the first time we
see her head-on

MIRANDA PRIESTLY in all her glory She is stunning perfectly
put together a white Hermes scarf around her neck

MIRANDA’S look is so distinctive you can spot hex a mile away
She is unlike any other beautiful woman singularly MIRANDA

INT RUNWAY -- DAY
EMILY runs up the hall to MIRANDA and walks her to her office

MIRANDA
Why didn’t you confirm

EMILY
I did He must have gotten sick
overnight Im so sorry Miranda

MIRANDA
Sorry is just an excuse to make the
same mistake again

We see ANDY watching this but MIRANDA seems not to notice her

EMILY
(xattling off quickly)

Here’s the bulletin so far At 700
Simone called from the Paris office
She figured out dates with Testine for
the Rio shoot and confirmed with

great smile and their friends from college DOUG and LILY

and offbeat

ANDY is in a full-body cringe

ANDY i

important people in New York
publishing Oh and then I rambled
like a crazy person

LILY —
When’ do you find out if you “got it

ANDY

DOUG

ANDY (cont’d)
Maybe I shouldn’t let this bother me
It’s a fashion magazine It’s all
about cleavage and lip gloss right I
turned down law school to be a
journalist Runway’s not right for me

Her friends exchange glances

NATE
I don’t know You do have to start
somewhere

LILY
Yeah Look at Nate He’s flipping
chicken breasts at O’Neal’s now so he
can work his way up to being a chef
And I would take any job in the art
world Even if it was not exactly what
I wanted

ANDY

my big break in journalism Great

INT NATE’S APARTMENT -— DAWN

Small with a view of an air shaft The bed‘s a futon On the

Dim light starts to trickle into the apartment NATE wakes up
pulls ANDY closer Soon they’re kissing Their kisses become
less sleepy and more urgent and at that moment

ANDYS cell phone rings Lond With a ring tone thats
ironically obnoxious say “Oops I Did it Again”

ANDY feels around finding the phone

EMILY
Her breakfast and lunch are always the
same Scrambled eggs and bacon for
breakfast For lunch a steak so rare
it’s practically talking Once a day
we do a Starbucks run and she gets a
tall white chocolate mocha hotter
‘than lava two blueberry muffins and a
cranberry bliss bar

as a phone book EMILY opens it and leafs through it

EMILY

The Book is The Bible The current
issue in its latest form Miranda
needs to approve every single thing in
the magazine so she edits it at night

INT MIRANDA’S OFFICE -- DAY

The magazine staff is gathered in MIRANDA’S office MIRANDA
flips through the racks of skirts

MIRANDA
Too eighties Too floppy Not eighties
enough Too horrible to be believed

She looks around at everyone It is clear she is horribly
disappointed

MIRANDA (contd)
The layout is supposed to be called
the New Skirt These are the oldest
Most cliched tired skirts on earth

Just then ANDY walks in Silently she lays out MIRANDAS coffee
order in front of her
MIRANDA (cont’d)
We need to start over

She looks at ANDY

MIRANDA (contd)
Sit down Emily I need you to take
notes on all these changes First of

all--

ANDY
(innocently)
Actually it’s Andy

MIRANDA
Pardon

ANDY notices she’s brought the room toa screeching halt

ANDY
My name is Andy Actually its
Andrea but people call me Andy

MIRANDA
What a fantastic story So
entertaining and full of useful
information

Everyone Stares at ANDY ANDY takes out a notebook

MIRANDA (cont’d)
The skirt is important Crucial in
fact Women need separates that can
take them through all facets of their
day

She grabs a skirt off the rack ANDY watches her

MIRANDA (cont’d)
This has sequins but it’s denim It’s
of no use to anyone We need to give
women clear choices about--
(to ANDY)
What are you looking at

ANDY
Me Nothing I--

MIRANDA
You think youre above this don’t
you Were talking about skirts ‘and
youre smirking

ANDY
I’m not smirking

MIRANDA
Inside you’re smirking

And now the room is totally silent Everyone there has had this
happen to them one time or another and theyre just grateful
this time it’s not them

ANDY
No no no I’m not I’m not above
anything Thats my motto I swear

MIRANDA
You see that droopy sweater you’re
wearing That blue was on a dress
Cameron Diaz wore on the cover of
Runway - shredded chiffon by James
Holt The same blue quickly appeared
in eight other designers’ collections
and eventually made its way to the
secondary designers the department
store labelsand then to some lovely
Gap Outlet where you no doubt found
it That color is worth millions of
dollars and many jobs

She smiles at ANDY Who quakes

MIRANDA (cont’d)

Your superior attitude is not
acceptable at this magazine In this
industry Or in my presence

INT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

of her work clothes into sweats as she rants

I thought I was being clever But it
turns out you are just as
disappointing as those other girls
And the only person I have to blame
for your ineptitude is myself for
hiring you

ANDY is frozen where she stands

MIRANDA (cont’d
You stranded me in the middle of
nowhere when my children needed me

MIRANDA and JAMES embrace

JAMES
An impromptu visit You are full of
surprises-—

MIRANDA places an envelope onto his desk

MIRANDA
The sketches you sent me For fall

MIRANDA walks around looking at the pieces on the mannequins A
hodgepodge of unfinished items

JAMES
I was trying to capture the
intersection of East meets West The
modern woman as Geisha meets rock star
with a little Desperate Housewives
thrown in

MIRANDA stops in front of a red dress with too many flounces and
flourishes - and eyes it critically

JAMES (cont’d)
But obviously the collection is still
a work in progress

MIRANDA
Actually no it isn’t my love

He looks at her I beg your pardon

MIRANDA (contd)
You are not going to produce this
line If you do I will not put any of
it in the magazine nor will you get
any department store orders

JAMES
Miranda I know the collection is edgy-

MIRANDA
I’m looking through the pieces
thinking kimonos motorcycle jackets
gingham
(shakes her head)
(MORE)

MIRANDA (contd)
Most of it I don’t get at all What TI
do get T don’t like I cannot let you
do this to yourself Or to me My
reputation is on the line here too

MIRANDA (contd)
I gave you editorial coverage before
anyone else I made people take notice
of you I was the only editor in the
front row of your first show in that
warehouse at the pier In the front
row clapping

MIRANDA steps closer to JAMES puts a hand on his shoulder

MIRANDA (cont’d)
I remember every piece ef that first
collection The swing of the chiffon
the vibrance of the embroidery

She walks over to ANDY and takes the pile of magazines Throws
each on the table in front of JAMES as she talks

MIRANDA (cont’d)
September 1997 you revolutionize the
hemline March 1998 you bring back
-femininity out of that horrible monk
phase June 2000 you’re the first one
to do the watercolor florals and
February 2002 you radically rethink
the empire waist

She leans into him

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
Your don’t just dress a woman you
embrace her give her the love she
might never get from a real man

And now the room is dead silent everyone rapt

And MIRANDA is no longer remote Shes talking about something
she loves and it’s written all over her We see ANDY watching
this change in her

MIRANDA (cont’d)

You make a woman feel powerful
special beautiful Even if she is
none of those things Her first day on
the job her wedding her first date
you are there for all the important
moments of a woman’s life

(MORE)

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
That is what you were put on the
planet to do This on the other hand--

She gestures the collection

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
--is just plain bad Burn it Think of
something else I know it will be
divine

And with that she gives him another kiss and sweeps over to the
elevator ANDY scoops up the RUNWAYS and follows

JAMES

job in Paris and continue to impress
me there’s no end to your future at’

WIGEL among the crowd of well-wishers

ANDY

NIGEL
She’s given me everything I have
Andy When it’s time shell pay me
back

ANDY

NIGEL

And he rejoins the swirl And ANDY sees CHRISTIAN having a

of Miranda Priestly right

CHRISTIAN

He looks at her Her gaze back is level So over this guy

ANDY
Better luck next time

CHRISTIAN

INT LIMO -- NIGHT

MIRANDA and ANDY ride along in the limo on their way back to
Paris MIRANDA is relaxed victorious

MIRANDA
You knew what they were planning

ANDY nods

MIRANDA (cont’d)
Christian had to brag about it So
predictable And you thought I didn’t
know

ANDY nods again MIRANDA laughs

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
You think that’s the first time I had
to defend myself There’s always
someone gunning for this job

She smiles

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
I was impressed though How hard you
tried to warn me And that whatever
you thought was happening you just
kept on doing your job

She studies ANDY

MIRANDA (contd)
I never thought I would say this but
I see a lot of myself in you Your
sharpness your focus your ability to
see a move or two ahead Above all
your dedication

ANDY
Thank you Miranda

MIRANDA
Your father was ill yet you chose to
stay and help me and help Runway
Thats very admirable

ANDY looks at her stunned that she knows

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
Nigel told me It was the right
choice exactly what I would have done
when I was your age
iil

(LL MIRANDA looks out the window Theyre approaching the next party
and the paparazzi are waiting outside as the fabulous people
stream into a Paris nightclub

MIRANDA (contd)
Not everyone can do that Push their
feelings aside

And now she‘s speaking as much to herself as to ANDY

MIRANDA (cont‘d)
The more powerful you get the more
you’ll be judged and scrutinized on
display You’1ll miss things --
vacations sunsets moments with your
family Some people in your life will
never accept your priorities Not
everyone can withstand that pressure
Andy But now you know that you can

ANDY stares at her blown away by what MIRANDA is saying

MIRANDA (cont’d)

And so now you know that you can have

my life You can do what I do Because

you can sacrifice the things that need -
sw to be sacrificed

ANDY

But what if I can’t do that I mean
what if that’s not what I want

MIRANDA looks at her and smiles and this time for the first
time her smile is almost maternal

MIRANDA
Dont be silly Andy Of course that’s
what you want Everyone wants to be

me
And with that she opens the door to the limo

«onto the red carpet where she is instantly embraced by the
flashing lights of the cameras

ANDY quietly steps out behind MIRANDA Squinting Shes never
gotten used to the lights

MIRANDA moves down the red carpet We follow her And it’s not
until MIRANDA is about to open the door that she realizes

Ne ANDY is no longer beside her

EXT CHAMPS ELYSéES -- NIGHT

She has never looked more beautiful She is serene And she is
free The wind blows through her hair She smiles

Suddenly NATE appears
ANDY

Thanks for coming I thought you might
stand me up

NATE
I thought about it

ANDY

Nate from the minute I quit my job

all I’ve thought about was what I
would say to you Ive rehearsed it in
my head a million times How I would
apologize for being such a jerk for
getting carried away - thinking that
what I was doing is more important
than the people I care about it
Theres no excuse for how I treated
you and how I let Miranda and my
ambition take me over until I became
this pod person And now that youre
here I feel like saying all that
isn’t enough

(beat)
I’m just so sorry

NATE
