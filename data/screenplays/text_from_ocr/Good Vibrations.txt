Shooting Script
12 August 2011
EXT HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY
CAPTION Belfast the Fifties

A beautiful ordered garden The colours are fairy-tale
bright Bird song

On a window an election poster has been taped VOTE HOOLEY
FOR A GENUINE ALTERNATIVE

On the grass sits a portable record player Beside it a
small pile of records CHILD TERRI’S hands pick up ‘I Saw
the Light’ - Hank Williams in his trademark rhinestone suit
- and places it on the turntable

A needle is set down on the vinyl CHILD TERRI smiles
enraptured

A tomato bursts against the window obliterating the
poster

CHILD TERRI dives for cover behind a large shrub

An egg follows the tomato stones land in the garden along
with arrows from a kid’s bow The TWO BOYS doing the
throwing and shooting are under ten BOY 1 wears a tatty
sheriffs hat BOY 2 has ‘war paint’ on his face

BOY 1
Fenian Lovers

An arrow flies overhead In the shrub CHILD TERRI crouches
holding on to his head he knows he has to keep it down

BOY 2 prepares to unleash a final arrow

BOY 1 (CONTD)
Commie bastards

The shrub seems to vibrate with rage CHILD TERRI pops up
CHILD TERRI
My da’s not a communist he’s a
socialist

His eye widens as the arrow speeds towards it

Impact

INT TERRI’S WORLD - NIGHT AND DAY JUMBLED TOGETHER

The music is distorted becoming the soundtrack as the
arrow takes us on an accelerated journey into Terri’s
world and through the future private and public
MAVIS (0S)
Do you think is he going to lose
it

There are looming faces - DOCTOR Terri’s parents MAVIS and
GEORGE - a disorienting rush of lights - suggestive of eye
tests but merging with other lights - city lights
searchlights There are eye charts which merge with 60s
protest placards - US out of Vietnam - Ban the Bomb - with
magazine covers Ego OZ

MAVIS (CONTD)
Is he going to lose it

The charts placards magazines merge with newspaper
headlines charting the start of the Northern Irish
Troubles a barrage of surreal images from the 50s to the
70s darker as the headlines change from agricultural shows
to sheep fleeing a bomb blast from schoolkids dancing at a
fete to a line of monks being frisked by British soldiers

MAVIS (0S) (CONTD)
(growing frantic)
Is he going to be blinded

Image and sound reach a crescendo

GEORGE (0S)
(consoling)

He’s just going to see things a

little bit differently

INT HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

An explosion fills the TV screen

TERRI now in his 20s rubs his eye There is throughout
an open almost child-like quality to his expression
totally at odds with some of what he does and says
Beside him sit MAVIS and GEORGE a man whose bearing as
much as his waistcoat and collarless shirt marks him as

out of his time

TERRI
What a fucking nightmare

MAVIS
Mind you your language

GEORGE
And they call this a revolution

A poster is on the wall VOTE HOOLEY STILL A GENUINE
ALTERNATIVE
INT DARKROOM —- DAY

TERRI wears a Kodak overall Sitting on a work bench knees
up smoking a joint is his mate ERIC - more sixth Stone
than fifth Beatle more Sticky Finger than Satisfaction

There are photos pegged up to dry There are also flyers
(clearly home-made) Terri Hooley Tonight at 8

Max Romeo’s ‘War ina Babylon’ plays on a portable
turntable TERRI sings along as he pegs up another flyer

TERRI
‘War ina Babylon tribal war ina
Babylon let me tell you it
sipple out there’

ERIC
Sssh

TERRI
What

ERIC

Do you hear something

The ‘something’ is an alarm going off but it barely
registers before TERRI starts singing again

TERRI

‘ tribal was ina Babylon’

(breaking off)
What baffles me Jamaica and
Belfast have so much in common
Cops and soldiers giving you
grief day in day out armed gangs
running round murdering people
for fuck all But at least in
Jamaica they have decent music

A muffled thump TERRI and ERIC look at the door ERIC
nicks the joint waves smoke away TERRI opens door and is
face to face with a BOMB DISPOSAL MAN or bomb disposal

blimp as he appears

BOMB DISPOSAL MAN
(indistinctly)
Get the fuck out

ERIC jumps down from the bench TERRI carefully takes the
record off before leaving A second later he returns grabs

a handful of flyers

EXT KODAK - DAY

SOLDIERS herd OTHER WORKERS behind a cordon where news
cameras lurk TERRI and ERIC saunter out
TERRI

So are you coming down tonight
ERIC

You know me I’1ll go anywhere

where there are people ergo
TERRI

Jesus everyone’s a defeatist

ERIC
Here just to cheer you up

He passes TERRI a bag of grass
TERRI
Tell you the truth I’ma bit
skint at the minute
ERIC
(brushing it off)

Mates rates

TERRI spies TWO WOMEN IN KODAK OVERALLS ERIC spies a YOUNG
BRITISH SOLDIER standing a little apart from the others

TERRI AND ERIC
Catch you later

They go off in opposite directions TERRI to the women

TERRI
The future Mrs Hooley

KODAK WOMAN 1

TERRI
Either of you both

He hands them a flyer

TERRI (CONTD)
Come down to this tonight

KODAK WOMAN 1
In town Have you a death wish

She and her friend walk off giggling
TERRI
(after them arms spread)

I have a life wish

He turns MARTY heavy beard heavy coat heavy politics
approaches red-headed NED skulking in his wake
TERRI (CONTD)
Marty Ned

MARTY
Id watch where I shouted that
life-wish stuff Some people
might take it as a challenge

TERRI
(nods to Kodak building)
Some people look like they have
enough to keep them busy

MARTY
That’s not one of ours If it had
been one of ours there wouldn’t
have been a warning

He flicks the CND badge on TERRI’s coat

MARTY (CONT’D)
Id forgotten about those

TERRI
No kidding

MARTY
Does it not get lonely being the
last man standing

MARTY glances up sees ERIC passing something to YOUNG
BRITISH SOLDIER who slips him a banknote in exchange

TERRI sees MARTY seeing it He flourishes a flyer an inch
from MARTY’s face

TERRI
Do your feet a favour take them
out dancing like you used to

MARTY balls up the flyer shoves it back in TERRI’s face

MARTY
See you around

He and NED move off TERRI has contrived to stick flyers to
their back

TERRI
(under his breath)
I fucking hope not
EXT BELFAST STREET - NIGHT

Deserted but for TERRI walking He stops at length before
a metal cage protecting the front of a bar the Harp
A security camera tracks his approach TERRI takes out his
glass eye and thrusts it up to the lens

A buzzer sounds

INT HARP BAR —- NIGHT

The hand that held up the eye now rifles through a box of
records Shangri-las 13th Floor Elevators Gladiators A
poster on the wall reads TERRI HOOLEY BELFAST’S NO1 DJ
Next to it a WAR IS OVER poster (‘Love John and Yoko’)

TERRI downs a brandy lights a cigarette lit takes a
record from its sleeve ‘Soul Rebel’ by The Wailers

He places it on the turntable closes his eyes and starts
to sing along

TERRI
Im a rebel soul rebel

He opens his eyes He is brought back to earth The room is
empty save for PAT the Harp’s Manager (he has one of those
Belfast expressions of permanent doubt Two plus two Is
four) and an OLD BOY at the bar doing Spot the Ball

PAT shakes his head slowly approaches TERRI

PAT
(handing TERRI £5)
Here

TERRI
I thought we said ten

PAT
Ten for the whole night That’s
you finished I’m pulling the
plug In fact you needn’t bother
coming back

TERRI
Why

PAT
Why Look around you It’s
finished No one wants to come
out any more

TERRI
She does

A young woman has appeared out of nowhere and is dancing
hypnotically alone in the centre of the floor
This is RUTH There is something handmade about her a
style so individual it borders on the eccentric

PAT hands TERRI another £5

INT HARP BAR —- NIGHT

RUTH orders a drink A loud scratch as mid-song TERRI
changes tack Dion ‘Born to be with you’ The OLD BOY
looks round confused TERRI skips down from the stage

RUTH is putting change in her purse

TERRI
Are you here on your own

RUTH
I was out for a walk and heard
the music Thought I’d come in
and see if it was as lively as it
sounded

The OLD BOY sneezes TERRI and RUTH look at him then at
each other then laugh

TERRI
It wasn’t always like this there
were nights here when you had to
queue just to get on the guest
list

RUTH
I don’t mean to be cheeky but
you don’t look like a man with
that many friends

TERRI
Do you want to know the truth of
it I used to have lots of
friends

INT HARP BAR 1968 - NIGHT

TERRI and RUTH are surrounded by the very FRIENDS Terri is
invoking swaying to music laughing animated In the
middle of the floor three men clink shorts glasses MARTY
less heavy (and wearing a CND badge) NED and ANDY with a
Zapata moustache

TERRI
Lots of anarchist friends and
Marxist friends and socialist
friends and pacifist friends
and feminist friends and friends
who were fuck all

MARTY NED and ANDY down their drinks NED’s comes back up
his nose The others laugh pat his back NED is furious

TERRI (CONTD)
Then the first shot was fired

The three shorts glasses smash

TERRI (CONTD)
And the first bomb exploded and
suddenly I didn’t have any more
Marxist or feminist or
anarchist friends

The room darkens The FRIENDS are now on opposing sides
the room MARTY and NED on one side side ANDY on the
other There is finger-pointing rancour

TERRI (CONTD)
I just had Catholic friends and
Protestant friends And I don’t
consider myself either So

INT HARP BAR —- NIGHT

Back to the 70s The room is empty again save for TERRI
RUTH the PAT and the OLD BOY

RUTH
So now nobody likes you

TERRI
Now I’m just a bit more choosy
about my friends Anyway you’re
one to talk where’s your gang

RUTH
They don’t like dancing as much
as I do

TERRI reaches over behind the bar for a note pad

TERRI
Have you a pen

RUTH

compulsory

TERRI

RUTH hesitates shrugs writes
TERRI (CONTD)

window bearing the sign CLOSING DOWN EVERYTHING MUST GO

and dads

RUTH
No Do you want to go back to my
mum and dads

TERRI

EXT BELFAST STREET - NIGHT

RUTH is practically trailing TERRI by the hand

INT DAVE AND MARILYN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

An ancient species of Mimeograph machine sits on a table
MARILYN HYNDMAN - a few years older than Ruth - leans
against the wall smoking while DAVE HYNDMAN circles it
wrench in his hand trying to decide which bit to hit

RUTH drags TERRI through tossing out perfunctory
introductions

RUTH
Dave Marilyn Terri Terri

EXT YARD - NIGHT

The yard has room only for a bin a bicycle TERRI and
RUTH

RUTH
I was at a party here one night

He follows the line of RUTH’s gaze the bin

TERRI (CONTD)
You’re not serious

He walks over lifts the lid looks inside then turns to
RUTH

TERRI (CONTD)
Shall we

Hand in hand they each put one leg over then the other
disappearing as though in a variety show magic act One
hand reappears and replaces the bin lid

A pause

TERRI (0S) (CONT’D)
I’ve got a glass eye

RUTH (0S)
So shut it

TERRI (0S)
Remind me to tell you my John

A CAMERA FLASH

INT 12 JERUSALEM STREET - DAY
A wedding picture on the hall wall Terri and Ruth

Bags and boxes the length of the hallway TERRI and RUTH
are moving in DAVE comes in through the front door
carrying a large carton TERRI behind him carries an
ashtray into which every so often as he rants he flicks
ash

TERRI
I tell you another thing I hate
that word communities Whenever
anybody in Northern Ireland says
community what they’re really
saying is side

DAVE
(from behind the box)
Youre dead right it’s false
consciousness

TERRI
Whereas collective

DAVE
- people of all religions and
none working to a common end

TERRI
Mind your feet there Dave

TERRI bends to set his ashtray on the floor When he stands
ERIC has appeared in the front doorway looking self-
conscious as well he might under a white cowboy hat TERRI
does an exaggerated double take

TERRI (CONTD)
Don’t tell me it’s Hank
Williamss birthday Roy Rogers’
Desperate Dan’s

ERIC is unable to get a word in before RUTH passes

RUTH
Nice hat Eric

ERIC gives up MARILYN comes into the hallway She stops by
a pile of boxes and reads what’s written on the side

MARILYN
Terri Terri Terri Terri
(bends to see last one)
Terri

She looks around sees TERRI

MARILYN (CONTD)
Are these all your clothes

TERRI
(points to a black bag
on the floor)

A For Sale sign is now marked Sold

ERIC
Listen I came to tell you I’m
clearing off to London for a
while

TERRI
Don’t take it so hard you’re
still special

Eric tries to raise a smile without success He looks over
his shoulder

ERIC
I got lifted the other night

The scene behind ERIC darkens He isn’t standing on the
doorstep any more but on a stool naked and shivering his
hands covering his groin HOODED MEN stand around him
ERIC however continues to talk as though to TERRI

ERIC (CONTD)
A couple of our old anti-war pals
were there

TERRI
That fucker Marty

ERIC
The other crowd

ANDY whips off his mask with one hand to reveal a leaner
infinitely meaner-looking version of his 60s self with the
other hand he brandishes a pair of sheep shears

ERIC (CONTD)
Except of course they’re alla
bit more pro-war these days

The other HOODED MEN hold shears too now They advance on
ERIC

TERRI winces as the shears flash and snap

One by one the HOODED MEN step back ANDY is last to go
ERIC is on the doorstep once more

His hand shakes as he takes off the hat His hair has been
savaged

TERRI
Fuck me

ERIC
Told me I was lucky it wasn’t a
bullet

TERRI

For what dealing a bit of blow
ERIC leans in and takes hold of TERRI’S wrist

ERIC
It’s not the drugs It’s me it’s
you - they try to pass themselves
off as the school rebels we show
them up as the prefects

He puts the hat back on so that RUTH coming downstairs
doesn’t see his hair He smiles at her then at TERRI

ERIC (CONTD)
(in an undertone)
They want us off the streets

TERRI watches him go

INT 12 JERUSALEM STREET - LATER 17
TERRI sits on the sofa with an Exchange and Mart open at
the ‘Records’ page a couple of ads circled RUTH lies
across his lap TERRI sets down paper

TERRI
You are everything to me

RUTH laughs taken aback by the suddenness of it all
RUTH
I’1l settle for being the most
important

MARILYN comes into the room carrying a box

MARILYN
Don’t mind me working here

TERRI
(into RUTH’s hair)
Everything
EXT BELFAST STREET - NIGHT 18

TERRI walks away from Sorting Office opening a package
records He walks on past boarded-up shops

A car appears on the far side of the street traveling in
the opposite direction

TERRI pulls his chin down into his collar as it passes him
The sound of the car fades into the distance leaving only
TERRI’s footsteps

Another car appears moving slower faces at the windows
TERRI retreats further into his collar When the car has
travelled a few yards beyond him it does a U-turn and
before TERRI has time to run pulls up at the kerbside

A THUG jumps out He pulls TERRI’s coat over his head and
drags him towards the car TERRI resists

At one stage his head is inside the car He and the driver
redheaded NED are eye to eye

TERRI
Ned

NED
(lifting a wheel brace)
Here hit him a whack with this

TERRI in his panic flails catching NED’s cheek with the
record bag He manages to break free leaving his coat
sweater and shirt in the hands of the THUG Somehow he’s
managed to hold on to the bag He runs THUG gets out and
starts to give chase

Headlights appear further up the street

NED (CONTD)
Quick get in
(holding a hand to his
face)
You’re a dead man Hooley

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT 19
TERRI topless stands back pressed against the wall
breathing heavily

INT 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 20

given way to anger RUTH is trying to get him to sit down

RUTH
Wait wait you say you knew this
fella

TERRI

From the Sixties He was a prick
then and he’s a prick now only
now he’s a prick with a gun

He sits finally lights a cigarette and closes his eyes
RUTH sits on the arm of the chair beside him Her gaze
roams over his face

RUTH
Do you think maybe it’s time we
got out of here

TERRI
No that’s what they expect -
that’s what they want

He jumps up knocking over the bag of records They spill
across the floor He and RUTH start to pick them up

TERRI stops straightens RUTH looks at him

They watch TERRI stop before their table He looks over his
shoulder ANDY enters with other LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES
(more of the FRIENDS) The REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES
instinctively rise from their seats hands going towards
their jackets

TERRI
Why doesn’t everybody sit down

Both groups do a wary distance apart TERRI occupies the
space between them

TERRI (CONTD)
You know the old saying about the
devil and the long spoon

Everyone is looking at him wondering where this is going

TERRI (CONTD)
I thought for a bunch of cunts
like you a few LPs would probably
do the trick

He fashions a smile empties a box on one table a box on
the other and spreads the records out jumble sale crap

TERRI (CONTD)
Don’t all dive at once

A moment They all dive at once

INT HARP BAR - AFTERNOON

See those ones in there though
They’re not the ones you have to
worry about Even the crazies

all started It’s the ones coming
up behind them you’re going to
have to watch out for

He nods across the street to where a couple of young
skinheads wait MUTT and HATCHET (who has a distinctive
spiderweb tattoo on his neck)

ANDY (CONTD)
It’ll take more than a few LPs to
buy them off

TERRI
You underestimate my record

ANDY pats TERRI’s cheek without affection He crosses the
street MUTT and HATCHET fall in behind him

EXT 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 33

There is a lame pop Cheers

The BOD from the Wholefood shop dispenses Elderflower
Champagne to DAVE MARILYN RUTH and TERRI (TERRI slips a
flask from his pocket and tops up his own ‘champagne’ with
brandy) A little sea of celebration in the middle of Bomb

FIRST RUC MAN
So you say But see if we so much
as find two cigarette papers in

TERRI
John Peel Last time I heard he
was playing Pink Floyd

He turns to the wall looking for a space When he can’t
see one he takes down the Rolling Stones Ulster Hall bill

TERRI (CONTD)
Sorry boys

EXT BELFAST STREET - NIGHT 40

TERRI and DAVE and their echoing footsteps are walking away
from the city centre Sound of an army helicopter overhead

DAVE
If I’d known you were going to
drag me down here I’d never have
printed that thing

He glances anxiously over his shoulder then has to quick-
step to catch up with TERRI

DAVE (CONTD)
You know they used the Pound as a
morgue on Bloody Friday

TERRI
Fuck sake Dave

They pass in front of the Albert Clock round a corner
round another and there is the Pound a once-fine bar now
barely standing

EXT POUND - NIGHT 41
DAVE
There’1ll be nobody here

INT POUND - NIGHT 42

There are people all right Young people PUNKS It’s
another city another world entirely

The journey from the door to the bar is a crash course in
teen vice 1978 vintage gropings playful headbuttings
surreptitious glue-sniffing

TERRI and DAVE squeeze in at the bar DAVE takes out a
pound note conspicuous amid the PUNKS counting out their
coins so of course the BARMAN makes straight for him

The PUNKS glare TERRI turns to look into the room

On a stage lit by a single fluorescent bulb four crop-
haired teenagers are wrenching out a song (basic even for
punk) from their instruments These are the OUTCASTS

Lead singer GREG COWAN exercises his snarl Guitarist
GETTY shirt off concentrates so hard on his guitar he
doesn’t notice the girls concentrating on him

Suddenly a number of RUC MEN come in and start nabbing
anyone who looks underage (and plenty do) taking names
asking for pockets to be turned out

TERRI pushes his way through the crowd and buttonholes an
RUC MAN writing down the name of a pink-haired PUNK GIRL

TERRI
Excuse me officer I’d like to
report a civil war outside

RUC MAN turns It’s the man who warned TERRI in the shop

TERRI (CONTD)
Not you again

FIRST RUC MAN
Step back Hooley

TERRI
No really take your time The
bombing shooting intimidation
that can all wait while you smell
her breath to see if she’s been
drinking

FIRST RUC MAN
(to PUNK GIRL)
Stay you there
(to TERRI)
And you I’ve warned you once
step back

TERRI steps forward FIRST RUC MAN’s hand moves towards the
gun at his hip Suddenly a single guitar chord sounds
Another band has taken the stage What they lack in snarls
they make up for in cheek This is RUDI

Down on the floor TERRI and RUC MAN are still squaring up
RUDI’s singer RONNIE MATTHEWS leans into the mike

RONNIE
(more spoken than sung)
We hate the cops

TERRI and RUC MAN finally look at the stage where RUDI are
ripping into ‘Cops’ The audience have forgotten about the
actual RUC MEN among them and are singing along

PUNKS
We hate the cops we hate the
cops

TERRI joins in right in NEAREST COP’s face The atmosphere
has changed the RUC have lost control

By the door of the bar an RUC SERGEANT gives the signal to
withdraw RUC MAN reluctantly backs off TERRI who is giving
it all he has got

RUDIPUNKSTERRI
ss RUC SS RUC

When the last cop has gone there is pandemonium TERRI is
in the thick of it hugging PUNKS getting head-butted
(accidentally Maybe not though he appears not to mind)

RONNIE
OK now that we’ve cleared the
air a bit this is ‘Big Time’

At guitarist BRIAN YOUNG’s opening riff the crowd surges
forward Suddenly the fluorescent stage-light falls from
the ceiling RUDI play on regardless in the gloom FANGS
grabs the light still lit and swings it above his head

TERRI looks around him - at the kids at the band at the
waving light - and it is all too much He starts to cry
Then he jumps up and down with everyone else

INT POUND - LATER

TERRI leans at the bar his head in his hands DAVE
approaches

DAVE
You all right

TERRI
(raises his head)
All right I’ve lost a tooth
been drenched in spit called a
wanker about five hundred times
(with a nod to barman)
And I hate to tell you but this

beer tastes like piss It’s the
best night I’ve had in Belfast in
years

He turns His eye is missing DAVE hands him the pint glass

at his elbow There is the eye floating in the beer

TERRI plunges his hand in shakes the eye dry and pops it
back in just as BRIAN and RONNIE of RUDI approach

TERRI pushes DAVE aside
TERRI (CONTD)

Boys where have you been all my
life

He hugs each one in turn unaware quite how little the boys

want to be hugged

BRIAN
Do we know you

TERRI
Terri Hooley I run a record shop
and that ‘Big Time’ song
(he sings the riff)
I want that in my shop

RONNIE
You can want all you like

TERRI
Are you telling me you haven’t
recorded it

BRIAN
Recorded it Who’s going to come
to Belfast to sign us

RONNIE
That’s just the way it is We
don’t care

TERRI
Fuck sake raise your
expectations
(a pause)
I’1l do it I’11 put it out

BRIAN
Youre pissed

TERRI
So what

DAVE arrives at TERRI’s shoulder just in time to hear

TERRI (CONTD)
I’1l put that record out

BRIAN
How
TERRI
I don’t know
(to DAVE)

How hard can it be
RUDI look at one another and laugh

BRIAN
Whatever you think mate

TERRI

You’re making a record fellas

TERRI and DAVE head for the exit

DAVE
You just can’t go charging into
something like that Anyway
were meant to be a collective

TERRI
We are you can print the
sleeves

Two OUTCASTS approach singer GREG a bottle of cider in
his hand and GETTY Pink-haired PUNK GIRL hanging on to
his until her BOYFRIEND grabs her back

GREG
Here will you record us too

TERRI
I’m not that fucking pissed

INT ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL - NIGHT 148

RUTH pushes herself up on her elbows with an enormous yell

INT ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL - NIGHT 149

Curtains drawn around the bed where RUTH sits sipping a cup
of tea The BABY is asleep in a hospital crib beside her

A NURSE opens curtains a look of disapproval on her face

NURSE
Someone to see you

She steps aside GETTY enters shivering If RUTH is
disappointed she doesn’t let it show

GETTY
Sorry I fell asleep in the
fucking van

RUTH puts her finger to her lips The NURSE frowns GETTY
doesn’t quite know where to put himself

GETTY (CONTD)
So was it all you know all
right
RUTH leans over and pulls the crib blanket down a touch

RUTH
A wee girl

GETTY peers in at her

GETTY
What are you going to call her

RUTH looks at her daughter

RUTH
I was thinking Anna

GETTY
(forgetting himself)
Class Short for Anarchy

The NURSE tugs the curtains shut

INT ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL —- DAY 150

RUTH sleeps A moment more a moment more She comes awake
startled TERRI sits in a chair at the side of the bed
wearing the clothes he was wearing the night before

RUTH
How long have you been here

TERRI
Ten minutes

RUTH
You should have woken me

TERRI
Sleep when the baby sleeps
that’s what my mum says

The BABY stirs TERRI and RUTH laugh at the coincidence
RUTH lifts her

RUTH
What do you think

TERRI
She’s like her mummy She’s
gorgeous

RUTH
(to BABY)
This is your daddy He’s an old
charmer
(to TERRI)
Do you want to hold her

TERRI
(almost recoiling)
My hands are shaking too much
Id be afraid of dropping her

RUTH tries to disguise her hurt by fussing over the baby

TERRI (CONTD)
It’s just nerves

RUTH remains focused on BABY She’s thinking something
over And then the curtains open and GREG FANGS and LANKY
PUNK tumble in GREG holds up a bottle of cider

GREG
Couldnt get the champagne
Terri but if you shake this
it’ll pop to fuck
He starts to shake it FANGS meanwhile collects glasses
from the lockers of neighbouring beds The NURSE from night
before reappears angrier than ever

NURSE
Right right out all of you

She shoves GREG FANGS and LANKY PUNK up the ward

TERRI has got to his feet RUTH catches hold of his sleeve

RUTH
I can’t believe you brought them
with you

TERRI

Sure they’re practically family

RUTH
But they’re not Terri We’re
your family
(shakes her head)
I can’t do this any more I need
to get out of Belfast for a
while

TERRI
Out of Belfast

RUTH
A friend of Marilyn’s has a house
in Helens Bay

TERRI
You telling me you’re leaving me

RUTH
I’m telling you everythings
different now I love being with
you but I’m not afraid to do
this on my own if I have to

TERRI
You won’t have to

From up the ward GREG shouts

GREG
Terri Terri

The NURSE returns
NURSE
I need you to get those fellas
off the ward this minute
The BABY is mewling RUTH opens her nightdress to feed her
TERRI

As he says the name a TEENAGE GLASS COLLECTOR passes and
mimes it in perfect sync

And then he says

INT BELFAST BAR —- NIGHT 154

Another night TERRI the worse for drink stands at the
bar hands on the shoulders of a YOUNG MALE JOURNALIST who
holds his notebook like a shield as he scribbles the line
TERRI delivers straight into his face

TERRI

‘I know exactly what the people
there need’

(hands off the

himself again)
I’m thinking brilliant a load
of free records dope

TERRI pulls open a drawer The bills practically fly

TERRI

TERRI

A bit over fifteen hundred quid
(he spreads out another
bundle of paper on the
counter )

They still haven’t paid me

TERRI stops searching finally looks at DAVE

TERRI

I think I threw out the address

DAVE

You think

TERRI

DAVE
Fifteen hundred quid

TERRI
Actually it might have been
closer to seventeen -fifty

DAVE at once joins in the search He pulls out a box roots
around Pushes it back pulls out another

DAVE
What’s this doing here

He turns with a padded envelope in one hand a tape box in
the other He reads the label

DAVE (CONT’D)
‘Pressure’s On Master’

TERRI grabs it with both hands then remembers himself
TERRI
(unconvincingly)
That’s the back-up
DAVE shakes his head

DAVE
Fuck sake Terri

EXT 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - AFTERNOON 162

TERRI and DAVE exit the building A police land rover is
parked at the kerb

TERRI pulls a fistful of bills from his pocket and throws
them at the land rover

TERRI
Do you think if I was dealing
drugs I’d have all these

The RUC MEN smirk DAVE pulls TERRI by the sleeve

INT HARP BAR - EVENING 163

DAVE and TERRI sit at a table with eight glasses on it two
empty pints two half-drunk two just poured and two
brandies

TERRI swallows one of the half-drunk pints sets the glass
with the other empties (both it should now be apparent
his) pulls a just-poured pint towards him

DAVE
Youre drinking too much
TERRI
Dave I always drink too much
Everybody we know drinks too

DAVE
This is different There’s
something

TERRI
(reaching for a brandy)
Something what

DAVE
Youre carrying on like one of
Led Zeppelin

TERRI stares

TERRI
That’s low

Another huge swallow of beer

TERRI (CONTD)
Anything else you’d like to say

DAVE
I just think we have to try to
keep things together

TERRI
Do ‘we’ And will you tell us
when we can have a piss Dave or
scratch our fucking arse
Stalinist

DAVE looks at him in disbelief

DAVE
Stalinist Your dad’s right

TERRI
What are you talking about ‘my
dad’

DAVE

(a tremor in his voice)
You took too much on because you
loved the glory You’re not a
socialist at all you’re a one-
man fucking show

(each letter a finger in

TERRI’s face)
T-e-r-r-capital-I

He gets up and leaves TERRI watches him go then looks down
at the table

TERRI
(half turning)
You didn’t drink your brandy

He moves the glasses so that Dave’s brandy and his own are
lined up in front of him He lifts the first

TERRI (CONTD)
‘From each according to his
ability’
(drains glass sets it
down raises the next)
‘To each according to his need’

The second glass is drained TERRI looks at his watch He
goes back up to the bar

INT HARP BAR —- MUCH LATER 164

TERRI is still at the bar paying more attention to his pint
than what’s going on behind him A band plays There is the
usual melee on the dance-floor but there’s an edge to it
now more aggressive

Something in the corner of the room catches TERRI’s eye
FANGS and LANKY PUNK appear to be going through a pile of
coats

TERRI sets his glass down and walks over

TERRI
You looking for something

They turn LANKY PUNK is clearly hiding something under his
jacket

FANGS
No it’s all right

TERRI
Because it looked to me as if you
were thieving

FANGS
Swear to God Terri we werent

TERRI says nothing but neither does he move LANKY PUNK
has no option He glances round

LANKY PUNK
I was trying to hide this

He opens his jacket to reveal a gun butt TERRI pulls the
jacket shut for him

TERRI
What the fuck are you doing with
that

FANGS

It’s not real It’s only to scare
people if they try to jump HIM

TERRI
Listen I’1l give you the money
for a taxi home I’ll pay your
taxis from now to Christmas just
don’t bring that fucking thing
out with you again

FANGS
It’s not for getting home

TERRI looks at the dance-floor his eye lighting as though
only just noticing them on one shaved head after another

INT BANK MANAGERS OFFICE - DAY

The BANK MANAGER sterner than he’s looked before is
delivering bad news to a clammy hung-over TERRI

BANK MANAGER
Your situation is really quite
grave It’s not just the over-
draft - it’s the accrued interest
from the original loan it’s your
tax return I can’t stress it
enough - unless something big
comes up very soon you are in
real danger of defaulting Which
is why I called you both here
today

RUTH it is now apparent is in the room too her seat a
deliberate distance away from Terri’s

She looks at the BANK MANAGER perplexed then at TERRI
BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
Ah
INT BANK CORRIDOR - DAY

RUTH pushes open a door walking fast A beat then TERRI
appears

TERRI
Ruth

She runs TERRI runs too He catches up with her as she is

about to pull the gate on an antique lift TERRI steps in

167 INT LIFT - CONTINUOUS 167

RUTH
The house

She presses the button for ground floor

They are squeezed tightly together nose to nose Not much
more room than they would have in a bin

They start their descent

RUTH (CONTD)
For gods sake Terri Why didn’t
you tell me I believed in you I
was there every step of the way
What made you think I wouldn’t
have gone along with that too

TERRI
It was one moment I just did it
I wasn’t thinking I never
thought The same as with Big
Time - I just did it Same as
with the tour - I just did it
The Harp Teenage Kicks - I just
did it It’s how I operate It’s
who I am And you know what - I
haven’t done too badly

RUTH
Open your eye Terri

The lift shudders to a halt ground floor

RUTH pulls open the door and walks out TERRI is left
contemplating the full-length mirror she was standing in
front of he’s an absolute mess

The lift starts going down No floors below ‘ground’ but

still it goes down and down darker and darker TERRI
stares at his reflection Grotesque

168 INT 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - NIGHT 168
TERRI sits alone staring at the picture of him from the
magazine or it stares at him Sonny Bono ‘Laugh At Me’ on
the record player He is shitfaced

A noise He looks up MUTT and HATCHET stand there

MUTT
We saw your light on

TERRI
I thought I told you were barred

MUTT ignores him HATCHET is picking up records looking at
them and tossing them over his shoulder

TERRI (CONTD)
Go on fuck off find a couple
of old ladies to frighten

MUTT
You’re very funny Isn’t he
Hatchet Isn’t he very funny

HATCHET grunts

MUTT (CONT’D)
Actually this is a business
call Me and Hatchet’s in a band
now Aren’t we Hatchet

HATCHET grunts again

MUTT (CONTD)
Tight wee unit

HATCHET sniggers

MUTT (CONT’D)

Fuck sake Hatchet behave

(to TERRT)
Thought you might be interested
in our demo tape We were going
to call it ‘The Only Good Wog’s a
Dead Wog’ then we thought ‘The
Only Good Taig’ but then we
thought ‘The Only Good One’s a
Dead One’ covered pretty much
everything

TERRI
Id sooner sell bog rolls than
Nazi shite like that

For all his bravado he is scared here He is edging as he
speaks - and as well as someone so shitfaced can edge -
towards the door HATCHET bars the way

MUTT
You’1ll sell what I tell you to
sell I’m used to getting my own
way Ask the fellas you used to
say would put me to bed

He sticks the head in TERRI HATCHET weighs in A flurry of
kicks and punches When it is finished MUTT leans over
TERRI

MUTT (CONT’D)
You made such a big deal about
not letting me in here

(MORE )

MUTT (CONT’D)
And look at it It’s fuck all
Youre fuck all You fucking
lost

HATCHET pulls a record rack over on top of TERRI who
hasn’t moved since the beating ended

MUTT leaves HATCHET delivers a final kick to the head

INT TERRI’S WORLD - NIGHT AND DAY JUMBLED TOGETHER 169

The music is distorted becoming the soundtrack as HATCHET’s
kick to the head takes us - as in scene 2 - on an
accelerated journey into Terri’s world not the future this
time but the past a collapsing together of many of the
moments that have made up the film as far back as CHILD
TERRI with his turntable sticking his head above the
hedge interspersed with lights and looming faces - DOCTOR
GEORGE MAVIS - and a single word repeated

MAVIS (0S)
Open your eye

INT HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY 170

Black

MAVIS (0S)
Open your eye

Black a moment more

MAVIS (0S) (CONT’D)
Very funny The other one

TERRI opens his seeing eye MAVIS stands before him a
bottle of surgical spirit and a wad of cotton wool in her
hand

TERRI is seated at the table on the mend but still
battered-looking

MAVIS (CONTD)
That must have been some door
What was it a car ferry

MAVIS ministers to a few more of his bruises and abrasions

MAVIS (CONTD)
I don’t suppose there’s any point
me mentioning the police

TERRI
They’d want to buy the door a
drink

MAVIS has tilted his face up and is looking into it

MAVIS
I never knew a wee boy as bad at
keeping his head out of harm’s
way People used to tell me I was
lucky girls were the hard ones
to raise You caused me more
anxiety growing up than a whole
hockey team

TERRI
Well I’d like to meet this hockey
team to discuss it

MAVIS bats him absentmindedly TERRI winces

MAVIS
You’re a married man
(beat)
Supposed to be

Suddenly irritated she goes to the window She raps the
glass Hard

MAVIS (CONTD)
Where is that man I told him ten
minutes ago his tea was ready
It’ll be stone cold

TERRI gets up takes the cup from the countertop

171 EXT HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY 171

The back garden small but ingeniously planted for maximum
yield and colour GEORGE straightens from a flowerbed as
TERRI approaches

They sit on a small bench

TERRI
Gardens looking well

GEORGE
That’s what all the dirty work in
winter’s for

TERRI looks down at the mug He’s almost forgotten he was
holding it

TERRI
Here

GEORGE
Did your mother send you out with
that

TERRI
I thought I better offer before
she put the window in She was
getting herself worked up about
me and Ruth

GEORGE
She has very strong views on
marriage She wouldn’t have
stayed with me all these years
otherwise

They sit on a small bench

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Remember that dig you had at me
about all those elections

TERRI
Da I’m sorry

GEORGE

It wasn’t ten it was twelve The
returning officer used to say if
I was a horse they’d have shot me
after the sixth But do you know
what I have friends and comrades
living all over his city And do
you know what else In every
election I increased my vote

TERRI’s gaze is locked on his father’s face He looks as
though he might hug GEORGE but GEORGE unaware of this (or
perhaps not so) chooses this moment to empty his tea leaves
on to the flowerbed

GEORGE (CONTD)
Victory doesn’t always look the
way other people imagine it

INT 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - EVENING 172

RUDI members slouch against the wall nearest the door DAVE
stands only a few feet further in arms folded tight

TERRI at moments in this scene is picking things up off the
floor the counter a physical counterpart to his verbal
attempts to set things straight

TERRI
All right A few apologies are in
order

RUDI and DAVE look like they agree

TERRI (CONT’D)
Brian you want to start
Expectation turns to confusion on BRIAN’s face

TERRI (CONT’D)
I’m only messing you
(beat)
Dave

DAVE opens his mouth to protest TERRI doesn’t let

TERRI (CONTD)

Listen I’11 hold my hand up
I’ve taken my eye off the ball
but we haven’t time for arguing
It’s time to focus We’ve a gig
to organise

BRIAN
A gig

TERRI
A Good Vibrations gig

DAVE
A fundraiser

TERRI
Yeah a fundraiser

DAVE
No harm to you Terri but unless
youre charging a hundred quid a
head I think it’s maybe gone
beyond a night at the Harp

TERRI
Who said anything about the Harp

DAVE
The Pound then
(TERRI is smiling not
the Pound either)
The Students’ Union

TERRI
Try ‘Ulster Hall’

BRIAN
Ulster Hall

TERRI
Why not

DAVE
Because the Ulster Hall holds two
thousand people

him

TERRI
I know how many it holds I’ve
been in it often enough

DAVE takes a deep breath

DAVE
OK OK we call in favours - we
get Siouxsie back to headline
Fuck it we call the Clash Stiff
Little Fingers

TERRI
Fucking showbands We don’t need
them It’s a Good Vibrations gig
it’ll be Good Vibrations bands

DAVE
(whispering)
Terri we’re talking two thousand
people Be realistic

TERRI
What like you were realistic
when you brought me round this
place

As he speaks the record racks disappear DAVE and TERRI
stand in the derelict building They look at one another

A beat And they have returned to GOOD VIBRATIONS TERRI -
still setting things straight - pulls the German magazine
cover from the wall

DAVE
How many posters do you think
youll need

EXT BELFAST STREETS - DAY 173

BRIAN is postering GREG is postering so too FANGS GETTY
RONNIE LANKY PUNK and TERRI of course

He stands before a wall with NF and SHANKILL SKINS scrawled
on it He slaps a poster over the top ‘Outcasts Moondogs
Ruefrex Rudi Big Self’ it reads ‘24th April 1980
Ulster Hall’

EXT BELFAST STREET - LATER 174
RUTH is pushing a buggy She passes a wall with Good

Vibrations posters She stops Looks The posters have been
pasted up in such a way that they spell out the word LIVE

INT ULSTER HALL - EVENING 175

A hand flicks a light switch then another then another
and another One by one the lights come up on the Ulster
Hall Which is empty

TERRI stands on the edge of the stage He looks worried
DAVE walks out behind him

DAVE
Where the fuck is everyone

TERRI
Itll be all right They’1ll come

DAVE
Weve hardly sold a ticket

RONNIE has wandered on stage He sings into the microphone
to the tune of ‘Pressure’s On’ and mostly tongue in cheek

RONNIE
(tongue in cheek
mostly)
Well you fucked up that and you
fucked up this so fuck knows
Terri why we’re doing this

A door opens at the far end of the hall A balding bearded
figure in a blazer comes walking towards them TERRI and
DAVE peer at him looks of recognition and disbelief

RONNIE has spotted the figure now as well

RONNIE (CONTD)
It’s John fucking Peel

TERRI and DAVE get down from the stage

JOHN PEEL
Always nice to get the full name

TERRI
I can’t believe you came

JOHN PEEL
You gave me the best two minutes
and twenty-eight seconds of my
life how could I not come I’m
just glad I got here in one
piece

DAVE
Rough journey

JOHN PEEL

Oh no the flight was fine I
mean getting through the doors of
this place

(seeing TERRI and DAVE’S

blank looks)
You mean you haven’t had a look
out the front

176 EXT ULSTER HALL - EVENING 176

TERRI DAVE and JOHN PEEL at an upstairs window look down
on a street thronged with PUNKS and overstretched RUC MEN

TERRI
Didn’t I tell you

DAVE
(finding the cloud in
the silver lining)
Fuck I hope they’re going to let
this go ahead

177 INT FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 177

A trickle of PUNKS is being let in The combined might of
the DOOR STAFF and the RUC can barely hold back those still
outside TERRI remonstrates with FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER

TERRI
Can you not just throw the doors
open

FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER
Id be within my rights to shut
them altogether Half of them are
full drunk and the other half are
trying to run in without paying

FANGS forces his way to the fore of the crowd at the door

FANGS
Terri

An RUC MAN pushes him back with a hand in the face

TERRI
Hold on He’s on the guest-list
(to Fangs)

Come on move your arse

FANGS
What about my mates

TERRI
Hurry up

TERRI waves them through too about a dozen in all Hands
shoot up here there and everywhere at the doors

PUNKS
Terri Terri Am I on the list

TERRI looks at the FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER he looks at the
BOX OFFICE STAFF waiting by their tills He looks back at
the doors the RUC MEN the waving hands of PUNKS outside

TERRI
(shouts )
Don’t worry you’ll all get in

The FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER walks away

INT BACKSTAGE ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 178

Sounds of Ruefrex from the stage RONNIE watches in the
wings BRIAN practices licks on his unplugged guitar

Nearby JOHN PEEL talks to GETTY whose interest is torn
between PEEL and Pink-haired PUNK GIRL across the room

JOHN PEEL
What amazes me is that punk has
more or less died out everywhere
else

GETTY
You around after the show John
(heading for the girl)
I’1l buy you a pint
JOHN PEEL
(to thin air)
Yeah buy me a pint
INT FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 179
The logjam at the doors has been broken A few PUNKS are

showing tickets at the box office Many more are walking
straight in past the RUC MEN past TERRI

INT ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 180

RUDI leave the stage elated GREG waits to go on

GREG
Cheers for warming them up

RONNIE scowls

The hall is so full now there are PUNKS on stage There are
RUC MEN too in the shadows at the very back

To a huge ovation JOHN PEEL appears and eventually speaks

JOHN PEEL
Youre a good audience People
always say Belfast is the best
audience And now here’s your
best band - the Outcasts

OUTCASTS come running on

GREG
Right this one’s for everybodys
favourite people in the world
Rudi’s already give you a song
about them This one’s called
‘The Bastards are Coming’

They launch into ‘The Cops are Coming’ and JOHN PEEL is
right they do sound finally like the best band in Belfast

PUNKS on stage bait the RUC who do nothing nothing at all

181 INT FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 181

‘The Cops are Coming’ is thudding through the walls DAVE
and FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER are deep in conversation
Neither looks happy

182 INT ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 182

The OUTCASTS are finishing ‘Self-Conscious Over You’
GETTY’s shirt is off GREG’s grin is broader than ever

GREG
And now I’d like to welcome on
stage the man who made all this
possible

TERRI’s name is lost in the roar as he walks out from the
wings ‘OUTCASTS’ across the back of his leather jacket
FANGS grabs the mike from GREG

FANGS
Terri is our leader Terri is our
leader na-na-na-na

TERRI takes the mike from him He is barely audible above
the stomping and whistling

TERRI
No leaders No godfathers

A kind of quiet returns TERRI breathes deeply scanning
the faces

TERRI (CONTD)
Thank you for coming When I look
out at you all gathered here it
confirms something that I’ve
always felt New York has the
haircuts London has the
trousers but Belfast has the
reason Good Vibrations isn’t a
record shop it isn’t a label
it’s a way of life

INT BACKSTAGE ULSTER HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Tumult out front TERRI runs offstage triumphant DAVE is
waiting for him fuming

TERRI
Isn’t it incredible

DAVE
It’s fucking unbelievable

TERRI
(oblivious)
The best night ever

DAVE

Terri we’ve made a loss We’ve
packed out the Ulster Hall and
we’ve somehow made a fucking
loss Your man at the front says
you had the longest guest list in
the hall’s entire history longer
than all the other guest lists
put together And all of it
apparently carried in your head

He has been getting closer and closer to TERRI His hands
suddenly shoot out and grab TERRI by the throat

DAVE (CONT’D)
Terri the whole point of tonight
was to raise money

TERRI
(trying to prise open
Dave’s fingers)
No Dave it wasn’t Not the
whole point Money couldn’t buy
what we’ve just done

He finally succeeds in loosening Dave’s grip Gasps

TERRI (CONTD)
We’ve taken back Belfast tonight

The chanting is getting louder Terri’s name DAVE finally
hears it With a flash of the OUTCASTS on his jacket TERRI
goes to run back on stage and runs straight into RUTH
She’s heard everything

RUTH
You and your guest lists

TERRI looks shamefaced

TERRI
I’m sorry

RUTH
About what The house Sure it’s
only bricks

The chanting from the crowd is louder still

RUTH (CONTD)
You’re wanted
(jabs a finger into his
chest)
But you still owe me forty quid

She walks away TERRI goes to speak but there is nothing
to say He runs on

184 INT ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 184
RUDI and the other bands have joined the OUTCASTS on stage

TERRI
We’re all going to do an old
Sonny Bono number because we
fucking can

And they fucking play ‘Laugh at me’

TERRIOUTCASTSRUDI
Why can’t I be like any guy why
do they try to make me run son
of a gun now what do they care
about the clothes I wear why get
their kicks from making fun

TERRI’s eye lights on RUTH dancing on her own

TERRIOUTCASTSRUDI (CONTD)
This world’s got a lot of space
and if they don’t like my face it
ain’t me that’s going anywhere
no So I don’t care then laugh
at me if that’s the fare I have
to pay to be free
