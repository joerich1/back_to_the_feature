EXT RUINS - DAY
After the tornado

A row of devastated houses in what used to be a residential
area Some walls are pulverized a shattered washing machine
lies against a street lamp The few houses still standing
gape like some abandoned cardboard boxes

A CREW OF WORKERS wearing HARDHATS pick up the rubble They
throw the debris into large dump trucks Among them his face
covered with a paper mask is BILL BAKER a tired lean
strong man absorbed by his task He stands in what must have
been a kitchen His gloved hands lift the rubble Shing He
throws it into the dumpster Psshh

Bill digs up a plastic childrens highchair He takes a look
at it one foot’s missing It ends up in the dumpster too

(Spanish)
What happens with the town after we
clean it up

SHAVED HEAD

BASEBALL HAT

And the people they all come back

SHAVED HEAD

Some of them But for the others
it’s too much They move on

BASEBALL HAT

I don’t think Americans like to
change

I don’t think the tornado cares
what Americans like

dressed MALE PASTOR (white 64) He is talking to about fifty

PASTOR

But many in our community rely on
government assistance in one form
or another I’m sure some of us
here tonight do Sometimes we just
don’t have a choice even when we
are willing and able I’m curious
what do we as good Christians
think about this type of
assistance

No Thank you ma’am

Bill continues

BILL (CONTD)
Allison and Lina they were
together And one night they had a
big fight and Allison went to a bar
where she met this Akim guy She
described him as tall light skin
They had some drinks and he stole
her purse When Allison got home
she found Lina dead and called the
police But they could never find
Akim He’s the one who killed Lina

The Detective looks at Bill nods turns back to the letter

golden button blazer on standing just across the narrow
street at the entrance of an old bar

INT BAR - DAY 56

The letter takes centre stage on the table Bill and Dirosa
sit in the backroom of the café alone

DIROSA
I was in service at the time of
this case In the police I didn’t
work on it but of course I remember
it

Dirosa looks at the letter

DIROSA
Have you talked to this Okonedo
The professor

BILL
No sir

DIROSA (CONTD)
I see why your lawyer doesn’t want
to help Some kid at a party hears
gossip about a murder Maybe she
remembers this famous case It was
on the TV

BILL
But why now Five years later
That’s how long my kid’s been in
jail Five years

DIROSA
Does she know you are here Your
kid

BILL
No sir

Dirosa considers this fair point He puts down the letter

DIROSA
Are you rich Mister Baker

BILL
No sir
DIROSA
This is a DNA case It means two
steps first I look for the young
man That will not be easy People
will talk He will try to
disappear

Bill listens nods

DIROSA (CONT’D)
Then if I find this Akim I have
to get a sample of his DNA and use
my connections in the police to
test it against the DNA from the
crime scene This doesn’t come for
free

BILL
How much

Dirosa tears a page from a small notebook and scribbles some
sort of addition A cost estimate He slips the paper
towards Bill who picks it up and reads it

BILL (CONT’D)
Twenty thousand dollars

DIROSA
Euros

BILL
Thanks for your time

Bill stands takes the letter and leaves
DIROSA (CONTD)
Mr Baker You believe your

daughter is innocent

BILL
I know she is

DIROSA
Then maybe it’s not so much to see
her go free

It’s clear Bill doesn’t like being sold He leaves

get you

Bill nods not really getting the joke

BILL
Id like to talk to the girl you
told Allison about

PATRICK
Yes I assumed as much

Patrick sits at his desk considers Bill He takes his time
as if weighing his words

PATRICK (CONT’D)
To be honest I’ve always felt
guilty about what happened I
should have warned Allison

BILL
Warned her About what

PATRICK
Well I knew Allison and Lina were
sleeping together but I had no idea
Lina had moved in with her I try
not to be cynical about those types
of relationships -- ‘the poor girl
from the ghetto and the rich
American student’- but then I end
up being guilty of naivety

BILL
Allison grew up poor She’s not
rich

PATRICK

Educated There is a lot of
resentment toward the cultural
elite I’m sure you are aware of
that

Bill is growing tired of the talk

BILL
What about the girl from the party

PATRICK
My student Her name is Souad She
is from the same outreach program
that Allison and Lina were involved
with

BILL
And she heard some guy talking
about Lina’s murder

PATRICK
This is what she told me

BILL
Could I talk to her

PATRICK
She will talk to you yes I will
give you her phone number

He jots down the number

PATRICK (CONT’D)
Souad does not speak English very
well You will need someone to
translate

BILL
Could you do it

PATRICK
No I’d rather not

He hands Bill a piece of paper

PATRICK (CONTD)
I’m still running the outreach
program I can’t be associated with
you or your daughter after what
happened Whatever my personal
opinion may be

Bill sits with this deeply insulted

BILL
My daughter’s innocent

got fucked up She started sleeping
with other people like it didn’t
matter Like she was using me or
something I felt so humiliated

I just want to see her To be with
her So much

French is better

ALLISON (CONT’D)
Are you OK
BILL
Dont worry about me Just take
care of yourself

Allison considers that comment and Bill Then

ALLISON
Ive learnt something new actually
It’s helped me a lot
(Off Bill’s look)
It’s something called Mektub A
nurse told me about it Its about
acceptance

BILL
Acceptance Of what

ALLISON
Your fate It’s helping me to stop
struggling to stop questioning
everything You just embrace your
fate and learn to live in peace
with it Its a Muslim idea

Even in her current state this is hard for Bill to accept

BILL
So you’re becoming a Muslim now

Bill is unexpectedly sharp Allison remains calm

ALLISON
Dad its not about religion it’s
about figuring out a way for me to
survive

Her directness disarms Bill and allows him to hear her

ALLISON
It’s about letting go of the shame
and guilt that push you down and
keep you down and make you feel so
powerless That’s how I’ve felt for
a long time-- powerless and
forgotten And that makes living
hard You know what I mean

Bill does Very much so

ALLISON
It helps me to look at it this way

BILL
OK But youre innocent we gotta
continue to fight so that

ALLISON
It doesnt matter that Im
innocent Its not about justice
dad Its about finding peace

BILL
Maybe so But I’m not ready to
give up I can’t

Allison almost smiles She can’t tell Bill is rattled

ALLISON
Dad You don’t have to prove
yourself Not to me

Bill hears this Too late He’s deep in it

ALLISON
(Calmly)
You wanna pray

He’s caught by surprise She holds his hand and closes her
eyes His stay open

news Mr Baker The judge in your
daughters case called me this
morning New evidence has surfaced
Apparently a retired cop came up
with a DNA match on the unknown
sample from the original crime
scene

Bill listens stone-faced

MAITRE LEPARQ
It also matched a sample the police
collected on a burglary case four
years ago After the trial
BILL
Did they catch him

MATTRE LEPARQ
No Not yet But for Allison this
does not matter All we need to
prove is sufficient doubt So even
if they can’t find the suspect
there is a real chance they will
release Allison In fact the judge
has already agreed to reopen the
investigation which is almost
unheard of I think this could only
happen in Marseille

Bill nods considers this

Thank you for coming to tell me
