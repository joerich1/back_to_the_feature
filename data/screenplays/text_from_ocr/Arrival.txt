FADE IN

EXT LAKE HOUSE - SUNSET 1
The sky is a shimmering expanse of stars packed together

LOUISE (V0O)
Memory is a strange thing

EXT LAKE HOUSE -— SUNSET 2

A modern home built on the shore with a large deck
The skin of the lake is a cloudy mirror

LOUISE BANKS stares up at the sky leaning against the deck’s
railing Merlot glass in one hand

Louise has a clean timeless look about her the kind of
woman who ages gracefully Short hair

LOUISE (V0O)
It doesn’t work like I thought it
did We are so bound by time by
its order

She steps back inside a little tipsy smiling

INT LAKE HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS A2

Stacks of books on shelves and tables A telescope against a
glass wall And dry-erase boards marked with foreign
languages Different colors for different dialects

LOUISE (V0O)
Maybe there’s a higher order

Mingled here are also dinner plates Candlelight

LOUISE
Darling is there any more wine

She pauses when a deck light winks on outside Her eyes
sparkle when she sees something

A question written on the glass lit from outdoors
“Do you want to make a baby”

LOUISE (V0)
I used to think this was the
beginning of your story
Blue Draft 2
Louise goes right to the glass wanting to touch the question
with her finger to make sure it’s real
CLOSE ON HER FACE From outside looking in a curious
circular shadow is thrown from the deck light But her eyes

start to water

In the background the bedroom door hangs open and the
silhouette of a MAN leans against the frame watching her

Louise turns around smiling again We know her answer

INT MERCY HILL GENERAL HOSPITAL — MORNING 3
Louise cradles a NEWBORN GIRL in her arms Her name HANNAH

Hannah reaches up
Crooks her tiny hand around Louise’s finger

LATER

A NURSE starts to take baby Hannah to give Louise some rest
Hannah BLEATS and reaches for her mother

Louise smiles through the exhaustion and pulls her back--
LOUISE
Okay come back come back to me
EXT LAKE HOUSE YARD - AFTERNOON 4
Four-year-old HANNAH dressed as a cowgirl
On a toy riding horse with wheels for hooves

Giggling like she can’t stop

LOUISE (V0O)
I remember moments in the middle

She pulls both finger-guns aimed at us
HANNAH
Stick ‘em up
INT HANNAH’S ROOM - NIGHT 5

Eight-year-old Hannah is tucked in bed
Said to us as a prayer

HANNAH
I love you
Blue Draft 3

INT LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
Twelve-year-old Hannah glowers at us

HANNAH
I hate you

--and storms into her room

INT MERCY HILL GENERAL HOSPITAL - MORNING
Twelve-year-old daughter HANNAH lies eyes closed
Hannah is pale Her head has been shaved in the last month

LOUISE (V0O)
And this was the end

Louise holds her daughter’s hand in hers
Her thumb traces Hannah’s knuckles

A life monitor beeps as Hannah’s heart stops
Hannah’s eyes roll up and she sighs her final breath
Louise’s grip on her daughter tightens Trembling

A Nurse starts to pull Louise away but she hangs on-- now
it’s mother trying to return to her baby girl--

LOUISE
Come back-- come back to me baby--

Louise is unaware she’s crying Hannah remains motionless

LOUISE (V0)
But now I’m not so sure I believe
in beginnings and endings There
are days that define your story
beyond your life

cUT TO BLACK

LOUISE (VO)
Like the day they arrived

EXT SKY DAY
Storybook blue patched with cumulous clouds

Drifting down to find a tree line in motion
Looking into a car on a road

Yellow 4

EXT PARKING GARAGE -— DAY 9

Louise parks her car end steps out Her hair is longer here
and there’s no wedding band on her finger

She carries herself like someone who’s learned how to be
alone handling her briefcase coffee keys etc

It’s oddly quiet in the garage around her

EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY 10
Louise crosses campus Absorbed in her thoughts

Overhead a pair of F-22 fighters slice across the sky

EXT STUDENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER 11
Louise passes the campus center

A crowd of STUDENTS are huddled around the glass outside the
student center looking in at a large TV The crowd is too
dense for Louise to see what is on the TV

Louise frowns but keeps going

Overhead a second pair of fighter jets rocket past

Louise looks up at the sky Apprehensive

NT UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM — DAY 12
Louise enters a classroom leaving the door open behind her
Out in the hall a couple of STUDENTS run by but it’s
unclear if they’re late for class or it’s something worse

Louise steps to her desk to unload her briefcase and thermos

The course name is written on the blackboard behind the desk
“Advanced Linguistics” and “Dr Louise Banks”

LOUISE
Good morning everyone

No response Louise finally looks to the class to discover
Only FOUR STUDENTS seated in an otherwise empty classroom

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Where is everyone
Pink 5

The Grad Students in the room shrug These are the hardcore
learners with their laptops out and textbooks open

The class session BELL chimes over the PA Louise looks back
at the door silently considering something then decides

LOUISE (CONTD)
Well let’s get started Today
we’re talking about Portuguese and
why it sounds so different from the
other Romance languages

Louise walks to a MAP of western Europe on a rolling easel
parked next to a TV

LOUISE (CONTD)
The story of Portuguese begins with
the Kingdom of Galicia in the
middle ages where the language was
seen as an expression of art The
way it was written and spoken was
rooted in aesthetics

One Grad Student’s phone CHIMES with an alert Louise pauses
thinking what the other Students are thinking--

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Any news you want to share

The Student reading his phone frowns suddenly nervous

GRAD STUDENT WITH SMARTPHONE
Uhh Doctor Banks Can you turn on
the TV to a news channel

Louise grabs her TV remote and turns the set to CNN to
reveal AERIAL FOOTAGE from a helicopter also live as a
REPORTER narrates in a near panic

REPORTER IN HELI (VO)
Are you seeing this Oh dear god
what is that noise-- WHAT IS IT--
should we be this close to it

FOOTAGE shows wilderness where a STRANGE OBLONG OBJECT
hovers over the tree line It absorbs sunlight and its
dimensions are difficult to grasp -- at times it appears
almost concave poised as if to dig into the planet’s crust

Another helicopter edges into view and suddenly the scale of
the object is clear It’s the size of a massive skyscraper

Bumper text at the bottom of the screen reads
“STRANGE CRAFT IN MONTANA”
Pink 6

Amid the WHUFF of the helicopter a reporter on location is
shouting in a voice on verge of a nervous breakdown

The audio cuts out and an ANCHORWOMAN takes over Cutting to
the studio where she pulls her attention to the camera

ANCHORWOMAN
The object uh apparently touched
down forty minutes ago just north
of I-94 were we’re waiting to
hear if this is perhaps an
experimental vessel or--

She looks for help off-camera and they cut to

MORE FOOTAGE closer to the ground The oblong ship is
immense And seemingly without creases or windows

ANCHORWOMAN (VO)
Hold on it-- I’m learning that
more objects like this have landed
in as many as eight other locations
around the world We’re waiting for
confirmation-- yes Can we-- Okay--

New footage a live feed in Japan An identical CONCAVE SHIP
is parked above a stadium lot

ANCHORWOMAN (VO)
This is from a site in Hokkaido

The Grad Students all stare in silent horror at the footage

One of them stands up and gathers his stuff ready to leave
But he only gets as far as standing up Unsure what to do
next where to run to

ANCHORMAN (VO)
(panicked)
This is worldwide it is happening
right now We don’t-- do we know
where they came from

A campus SIREN spins up the kind used for tornado warnings

The STUDENTS now start to get their materials together to
leave Louise snaps out of her shock and with authority

LOUISE
Okay yes let’s go Class over

Pink 7

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER 13

Louise joins a FLOCK of people on campus hurrying to the
parking structures Nearly everyone keeps looking up from
time to time The SIREN is louder here

Above Another pair of FIGHTER JETS fly overhead

EXT UNIVERSITY PARKING STRUCTURE — DAY 14

Louise gets to her sedan climbs inside windows down Her
satellite radio plays as she powers the car --

PRESS SECRETARY (VO)
But for now we’re simply asking for
cooperation while authorities
assess the object Until further
notice the site is a no-fly zone

From the street Sounds of a car accident It startles her

REPORTER (VO)
So you’re saying it’s not ours Do
you know if it’s even from Earth

Louise opens her door and steps out again to look down at

The wreck below The aftermath The two DRIVERS panicked and
on edge but uninjured

PRESS SECRETARY (VO)
We’re still collecting information
coordinating with other nations
We’re not the only ones with one of
these in our back yard

Louise returns to her car and straps herself in
REPORTER (V0)
If this is some sort of peaceful
first contact why send twelve
Why not just one

She backs out tires yelping at her quick getaway

EXT LAKE HOUSE - EVENING 15

Her sedan pulls up at the lake house from the opener
Blue Draft 8

16 INT LAKE HOUSE — FRONT ENTRY -— EVENING 16
Louise enters with her cell phone to her ear carrying her
valise

LOUISE

(into phone)
I don’t know Mom I’m listening to
the same news coverage

(beat)
Don’t-- Mom don’t bother with that
channel how many times do I have
to tell you not to pay attention to
those idiots

(beat)
All right then

17 INT LAKE HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS 17

Traversing a hallway to bedrooms Louise pulls her shoes off
by the heel switching hands with the phone as she goes

LOUISE
Do I sound worried Exactly

Louise pauses at an open bedroom door halfway down the hall

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Me Oh you know The same

There’s a tiredness in her answer Like she’s been down this
road with her mother before
18 INT SPARE BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS 18

An empty room save for a couple of stray book boxes and a
neglected stationary bike in the corner

Louise surveys the room from the door

LOUISE
I’m fine Mom
(not really)

Okay call me later

She disconnects the call and leans against the door frame
Staring into the empty room with a quiet sadness

Finally having come to some decision she pushes off again

Yellow 9

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER 19
Louise alone on the couch Half a bottle of wine left

The place is furnished nicely but there are telltale signs
of a single occupant in a larger space No family photos

A recliner by the couch has become a surrogate bookshelf
TV is on More coverage of the alien landing

CNN REPORTER (VO)
-»and at around eight hours after
landing there are still no signs
of what might be called ‘first
contact’ The objects measure at
least fifteen hundred feet tall--

Changing channel Footage changes to a snowy tundra where
another UFO has landed and flattened a section of fence line

This is a foreign channel Louise gets international
stations The anchor speaks in Russian

New channel Another SHIP hovering over the ocean

AERIAL COVERAGE Fleets from three different nations threaten
each other for possession of the massive UFO

NETWORK REPORTER (VO)
--none of whom can claim because
this ‘object’ as it’s being called
is actually hovering over
international waters One Iranian
cruiser has fired across the bow of
the Indian fleet--

Louise changes the channel
Finding The press room in the west wing of the White House

PRESS SECRETARY
We have to entertain the idea that
if it is a kind of vessel it may
be unmanned Regardless we have a
protocol for scenarios like this--

The word “protocol” instantly sours Louise to the news She
mutes the TV and shuffles off to her bedroom--

Yellow 10

INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS 20
--picks up a remote off a nightstand and turns on a TV facing
her bed More news the volume low

INT LOUISE’S BEDROOM MORNING 21

Louise is asleep in bed The covers are a mess She’s
spooning extra pillows as if they were a bedfellow

Louise wakes with a start as if from a dream

EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING 22
Louise returns to work

The campus is empty Two STUDENTS hurry between buildings
Louise passes the student center

It’s too quiet

INT UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM — MORNING 23

Louise enters her classroom No one has showed up

INT LOUISE’S OFFICE — DAY 24

A cramped office with a window looking out on the city
Sirens wail in the distance

Louise has barely decorated the place It’s the sign of
someone untethered from the world Closed off She sits at
her desk grading papers Streaming video news coverage plays
on her computer

ANCHORWOMAN (VO)
Forty-eight hours later and still
no further developments from the
sites of the twelve UFOs Borders
are closed and flights--

COLONEL WEBER (0OS)
Two days and already the public
expects us to know the answers

Louise turns to see the source of the voice at her office
door COLONEL WEBER (50s) wears civilian clothing but his
body language screams career military Callused hands sharp
eyes rigid posture
Yellow 1OA
He steps in and reaches to her computer powering off the
speakers Behind him two large MEN stand guard in the hall

LOUISE
Who are you
Yellow ll

Weber has his ID ready shows it to her

COLONEL WEBER
I’m Colonel GT Weber You and I
never formally met but two years
ago you did some Farsi translation
for Army Intelligence

LOUISE
I remember Alan Boudreau hired me

COLONEL WEBER
Alan works for me You made quick
work of those insurgent videos

Louise crosses her arms He’s touched a nerve

LOUISE
You made quick work of those
insurgents

COLONEL WEBER
You have another two years on your
SSBI so you still have top secret
clearance That’s why I’m in your
office and not at Berkeley

LOUISE
Okay

COLONEL WEBER
I need you to translate something
for me

As one of the men guarding the door shuts it giving them
total privacy Colonel Weber places a pocket-sized digital
recorder on Louise’s desk

He hits PLAY White noise shuffling
Then murmured talk and

MAN’S VOICE
(on recorder)
Why are you here

In response A SERIES OF SOUNDS that have no Earthly
comparison An audio mixture of organic clicks rushing
water whispers and low-octave moaning

MANS VOICE (CONTD)
(on recorder)
Can you understand us

Almost immediately the SOUNDS return this time slightly
different The bass tone is lower The whispers raspy

Louise listens rapt As if she’s waking up from a long
sleep She leans in

Weber studies her face while she listens

MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
(on recorder)
Where did you come from

Before an answer is heard Weber stops playback and takes
back the recorder

COLONEL WEBER
Well What do you make of it

LOUISE
Is that

COLONEL WEBER
Yes

The weight of his answer settles on Louise Beat

LOUISE
How many

COLONEL WEBER
How many what

LOUISE
How many of them were speaking

Weber raises an eyebrow at her but answers

COLONEL WEBER
Two Assume they were not speaking
at the same time

LOUISE
Are you sure Do they have mouths

COLONEL WEBER
Keep your focus on the sounds

Weber replays a portion of the recording The alien VOICE
sounds even stranger a second time

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
What would be your approach to
translating this Does any of it
sound like words to you Phrases
Pink LOUISE
I don’t know

COLONEL WEBER
(said not as a question)
What can you tell me

LOUISE
I can tell you it’s impossible to
translate this from an audio file
To do this right I need to be
there Interacting with them

Weber bristles at this

COLONEL WEBER
You didn’t need that for the Farsi
translations

LOUISE
It was Burushaski not Farsi and I
didn’t need it because I already
knew the language This-—-
(points at recorder)
This is a whole new ball game

COLONEL WEBER
I know what you’re doing

LOUISE
Tell me what I’m doing

COLONEL WEBER
I’m not taking you to Montana It’s
all I can do to keep it from
becoming a tourist site for anyone
with TS clearance

LOUISE
I’m just telling you what it will
take to do this job

COLONEL WEBER
We will set up a safe room at a
facility here in town where you can
observe video of the conversations
in real-time I’1ll put you on the
line with our team at the site

LOUISE
No

Blue Draft COLONEL WEBER
(beat)
What do you mean ‘no’

LOUISE
It wont work that way

COLONEL WEBER
Youll make it work

Her patience wears thin

Weber

Weber

Weber

LOUISE

Have they spoken to us in English

COLONEL WEBER
No

LOUISE

Have they played back any of our
media or given you any indication

they understand us

doesn’t have a reply for this His eyes shift

LOUISE (CONTD)

So in order for this to work I
might have to teach them English

The basics Nouns verbs I

cant

do that remotely I have to be in

the room with them
and Louise stare down

COLONEL WEBER

There is one opportunity here and
that is to study them remotely If
I leave here your chance is gone

turns to leave

LOUISE

Colonel You mentioned Berkeley
You going to ask Danvers next

pauses at the door

COLONEL WEBER
Maybe why

LOUISE

Before you commit to him ask him

the Sanskrit word for “war”
translation

and its

Pink 15

She grins at him

Weber exits After he leaves her grin fades

INT LOUISES BEDROOM - NIGHT 25

Louise is asleep in her bed Again with the formation of
pillows around her

She wakes to a rhythmic thumping Low dull Her hand goes to
her heart It’s not her heart

From her bedroom window A distant flying object vaguely like
a helicopter One thing is clear it’s on fast approach
As it gets closer treetops bend and leaves scatter

INT LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 26

Dressed in a bathrobe Louise crosses to the front windows
looking out on her wide flat front yard

SPOTLIGHTS shine into her house STROBES pop We are so used
to how a helicopter sounds but this is different The engine
noises the rotors -- it’s more muscular threatening

The lights finally dim to reveal A Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk
has touched down on the lawn The passenger door is open
slid back to reveal someone riding in the rear compartment

Her doorbell rings Louise answers it
Weber stands at the door now in military uniform

COLONEL WEBER
Good morning

LOUISE
Colonel

COLONEL WEBER
Gavisti

LOUISE
Thats the word But what did
Danvers say it means in Sanskrit

COLONEL WEBER
He said it means an argument
What does it really mean

LOUISE
“BK desire for more cows”

A27

Blue Draft 16

COLONEL WEBER
Pack your bags

It hits Louise She got the job
LOUISE
All right Give me twenty minutes

COLONEL WEBER
You have ten

Louise glares at Weber for just a moment then dashes off to
her bedroom

EXT LAKE HOUSE — PRE-DAWN 27

Louise (now dressed and carrying an overnight bag) hurries
for the Blackhawk The rotor blades flatten the grass on her
lawn and pull at Louise’s coat

Weber helps Louise inside and then shuts the door

The helicopter rises immediately

INT BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER —- PREDAWN A27

Louise drops into a bench seat still holding her bag
As she buckles in

IAN Language is the foundation of
civilization

Across from her IAN DONNELLY (late 30s) Oxford shirt wild
hair fierce eyes and a smile in the corner of his mouth
that makes it hard to tell what he’s thinking

Tan holds a book He’s reading from it

LOUISE
Pardon

IAN
“It is the glue that holds a people
together and it is the first
weapon drawn in a conflict”

COLONEL WEBER
Louise this is Ian Donnelly

Neither Louise nor Ian offer to shake hands They study one
another as they talk
Yellow 17

LOUISE
That’s quite a greeting

TAN
You wrote it

LOUISE
It’s the kind of thing you write as
a preface Dazzle them with basics

TAN

It’s good Even if it’s wrong
LOUISE

Wrong
IAN

The cornerstone of civilization
isn’t language It’s science

COLONEL WEBER
Tan is a theoretical physicist from
Los Alamos He is the man with the
questions You will be reporting to
me but you’1l be working with him
when you’re in the shell

LOUISE
The shell

IAN
That’s what they’re calling the UFO

COLONEL WEBER
Priority one What do they want
where are they from

Weber speaks them as orders Ian thinks it’s a conversation

IAN
Yes but beyond that How did they
get here Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel

Ian pulls a Moleskine notebook from his pocket excited to
share from it--

TAN (CONTD)
I’ve prepared a list of questions
starting with some “handshake”
binary sequences-—-

Yellow 18

LOUISE
How about we just talk to them
first Before we start throwing
math problems at them

COLONEL WEBER
This is why youre both here

Tan nods as he puts his notebook up but it’s clear he’s
anxious to get past the small talk and on to the big ideas

EXT MONTANA LANDING SITE — DAWN 28

Wide angle on approach A mile out Roads and highways are
crowded with traffic up against military blockades

In the distance The ALIEN SHIP in silhouette behind the
rising egg-yolk sun

The ship dwarfs the wilderness around it and stands out like
a Massive strange edifice that would seem ancient were it
not hovering over the ground

At this distance a low TONE starts to resonate in everyones
sternum The Blackhawk lances over the treeline

INT BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER MORNING 29

LOUISE’S POV The alien ship towers over the field It seems
impossibly balanced as if it could tip over and crush
everyone at any time

A mile away a series of tents have been erected Up close
the ship looks majestic ominous

INT BLACKHAWK CONTINUOUS 30
Louise and Ian stare out the side window at the ship

COLONEL WEBER
Every thirteen hours a sort of door
opens up at the base That’s where
we go in

LOUISE
How many of us are here

COLONEL WEBER
Youre the only scientists going
in But you both have a team here--

Yellow 19

LOUISE
A team What kind of team

COLONEL WEBER
Mostly NSA Cryptanalysts a couple
of signal processing experts

A phone handset’s cradle lights up by Weber He answers it

LOUISE
(sotto to Ian)
When’s the next meeting

Tan shrugs -- he just got here He’s busy making a SKETCH of
the ship in his notebook His notebook is a tiny library of
all his thoughts and ideas

Weber hangs up

COLONEL WEBER
We’ll need to hurry you through

EXT HELIPAD —- MOMENTS LATER 31

Colonel Weber Ian and Louise are escorted out of the
helicopter and into base camp The camp is divided into two
clusters of tentsbuildings OPERATIONS and SCIENCE

CAPTAIN MARKS (barely 30 disciplined a man of rules) meets
Weber and updates him as they walk

CAPTAIN MARKS
Materials team called in with some
early analysis

COLONEL WEBER
Tell me

CAPTAIN MARKS
Normally you find three or four
elements in base material Humans
have eleven That thing is made of
every single element known to us
plus a dozen we’ve never seen

Weber frowns worried But Ian has the opposite reaction His
face lights up in wonderment and a hundred questions pile up
in his mind but then --

COLONEL WEBER
All right Take these two to
Kettler

Yellow CAPTAIN MARKS

Yessir
COLONEL WEBER

(to Ian and Louise)

You will follow this man to

medical The procedure should take

just a few minutes

Louise and Ian keep up with the Captain’s brisk march

A Medevac helicopter powers up on a pad nearby Someone
strapped to a gurney inside flanked by two Paramedics

Ian notices So does Louise They exchange looks

EXT TENT COMPLEX MOMENTS LATER
Captain Marks leads them to a large tent
Louise looks back at the ship for a moment Nervous

Behind her Ian looks back at it too Curious

INT MEDICAL TENT - MOMENTS LATER

is

A staff of military medical personnel are busy testing new

diagnostic equipment

Captain Marks opens a flap into a room where we find a man in

scrubs with a tray of hypodermics This is DR KETTLER
professorial even-toned voice but a predator’s eyes

DR KETTLER
Louise Banks and Ian Donnelly

Louise nods Kettler gestures to two plastic chairs They

sit while he prepares a syringe with a vial attached

DR KETTLER (CONTD)
When is the last time either of you
have eaten

LOUISE
Last night

TAN
Same

Yellow 21

DR KETTLER
When is the last time you did
something stressful

TAN
Does right now count

LOUISE
Who was being carted off on the
medevac

DR KETTLER
Not everyone is wired for what
youre about to do Our brains
aren’t always able to process
experiences like this

(then)

I’m going to get some blood from
you and give you an immunization
dose that covers a battery of
bacterial threats Roll up your
sleeves please

Ian begins rolling up his Oxford shirt sleeve Louise notices
Ian is complying then follows suit

Kettler moves his tray over and wraps a band around Louise’s
arm just above her elbow As he draws blood

DR KETTLER (CONT’D)
The booster is a kick to your
system so you might feel some side
effects Nausea Dizziness
Headaches A ringing in your ear
like you have Tinnitus

Louise looks over at Ian to share a look of Do you believe
what Kettler just said

But Ian is staring out a window at the big ship

INT OPERATIONS TENTINTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 34

Tan and Louise enter this tent that serves as the nerve
center of base camp The room is fitted with dozens of
flatscreens each one monitoring activity of a landing site
in some other part of the world

AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST (0S)
Honestly they’ve been mostly quiet
so far And by the time we start to
make any real progress it’s over
and we’re out the door again
Yellow 21a

Weber is waiting for them now in full uniform Behind him a
large white board

AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST (0S) (CONT’D)
Were trying to reduce our setup
time maybe limit the diagnostic
gear so we can focus more on our
friends across the glass

AGENT HALPERN (0S)
How long are your sessions
Pink 22

On the white board Twelve columns with labels of countries
CHINA GREENLAND RUSSIA 1 (SIBERIA) RUSSIA 2 (BLACK SEA)
JAPAN UNITED STATES SUDAN VENEZUELA SIERRA LEONE
WALES PAKISTAN INDIAN OCEAN

Information is written under the columns and spy satellite
plus location photos are peppered throughout It shows what
every country is doing at their separate sites

Standing at a MONITOR is a MAN in a suit and tie Arms
crossed over his chest This is AGENT HALPERN All business
His job is international relations

On the monitor is an AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST talking via VTC

AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST
The barometer readings don’t
change but like clockwork after
forty-six minutes and two seconds
the gravity slowly shifts to slide
us out of the room Like were
insects on a piece of paper and
they’re easing us out of the house

AGENT HALPERN
Is there a scientific explanation
for it Like is it for them

AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST
We think it’s for us The air
doesn’t seem to circulate in the
chamber so after about an hour
wed run out of oxygen

AGENT HALPERN
But it doesn’t take thirteen hours
to pump fresh air into that room

IAN (0S8)
Atmosphere

AGENT HALPERN
Excuse me

IAN
If their atmosphere is different
from Earth it could take them
hours to re-balance the oh-two
content and pressure for us every
time they open their door

AGENT HALPERN
So you’re saying they could
suffocate us if they wanted
Pink Weber guides Ian away from Halpern and the monitors
toward the way out of the tent

COLONEL WEBER
Remember We need answers as soon
as possible Why they are here
What they want what they will give
us This is the priority

Yellow 23

IAN
Have they responded to anything
Numbers Shapes Fibonnacci

COLONEL WEBER
We can’t tell what they’re saying
when they respond to “hello” So
don’t get ahead of yourselves

Louise frowns as a new question occurs to her

LOUISE
What have you figured out

INT SCIENCE TENT — MOMENTS LATER 35

On the other side of basecamp Communications Weber pulls
back the flap and Louise enters Ian trailing behind her

Inside A dozen MEN AND WOMEN work at computer stations with

large monitors and at an oversized white board The monitors

all display the same kind of data audio recordings visually
bouncing and fluctuating as the alien VOICES speak

Some of the members approach to shake Louise’s hand and AD
LIB their greetings before returning to analysis work

A few of them remain at their stations headphones on

COLONEL WEBER
Were just getting started

Stepping back Louise asks Weber

LOUISE
Why not send them in

COLONEL WEBER
(beat)
Honestly they all prefer to stay
out here

Suddenly a low deep bass TONE vibrates the tent A pen
falls off a desk A TECH grabs his coffee mug The tent-ties
CLATTER against the support poles It’s terrifying

COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D)
That’s our ten-minute warning

INT “CLEAN ROOM” — DAY 36

Blue Draft 24

Full HAZMAT suits hang on a wall

Captain Marks brings Ian and Louise in They each have cotton
swabs taped to their elbows now

CAPTAIN MARKS
Climb into these I’1l help you
with the helmet seals

IAN
What kind of radiation exposure are
we walking into

CAPTAIN MARKS
Nominal These are just for safety

LOUISE
Is there physical contact with the

trouble saying “aliens”

IAN
No

CAPTAIN MARKS
There’s a wall Like a glass wall
You can’t get to them

IAN
What do they look like

A flashing light winks over the exit door
Captain Marks claps his hands Let’s go

On Louise wanting to get off this ride but she follows--

EXT BASE CAMP — DAY A36

The Shell looms in the distance at the other end of a mile-
long “road” formed in the grass from all the back-and-forth

A dusty PICKUP TRUCK waits for them its tailgate down a
step ladder planted at its lip

A second TRUCK is already on the road its bed loaded with
gear and two SCIENCE TECHS in similar moonsuits

Nearby two DRONE OPERATORS launch a surveillance drone into
the air which then flies ahead of the trucks toward the
shell Leading the way

Blue Draft 25

Louise and Tan are led into their pickup truck Bench seating
has been set up but it all feels a bit cobbled together

Weber (in his suit and mask) nods at a LIEUTENANT who locks
the tailgate into place for them and slaps the truck They’re
good to go

The truck starts for the Shell

Louise stares at it with wide eyes Soon the sun eclipses
the ship and the whole truck succumbs to shadow

HIGH ANGLE From a perch above the Shell the two tiny trucks
slow as they arrive underneath it

EXT “THE SHELL” - MOMENTS LATER 37

The craft is even more intimidating close-up Its surface on
the undercarriage portion seems to absorb light

It’s also floating twenty or so feet overhead

Louise and Ian join a small contingent of MILITARY PERSONNEL
also in HAZMAT suits all attending crates of specialty gear
One of them gestures at

A SCISSOR LIFT parked directly under the Shell Nearby a
second “backup” scissor lift sits parked

She follows Weber Marks and two other Science Techs (a
total of 6) Her breath is loud in her helmet She’s shaking

They step onto the Scissor Lift
Captain Marks pounds a button and they start to elevate

A safety CHAIN hooked to the guard rail on the lift RATTLES
incessantly Louise notices it Looks up again

LOUISE
It’s just hovering

IAN
They probably traveled millions of
light years they couldn’t go an
extra twenty feet

Said with a grin but no one laughs

The lift is now so close overhead they can reach up and
touch it The two TECHS do just that -- feeling the surface
for some purchase or change But it’s so dark there’s no
real sense of dimension here

Yellow 26

Tan tries too And suddenly they’re all reaching feeling

IAN’S GLOVED HAND curls into something An edge A hole that
can’t be seen on the surface

It widens as marked by his hand Opening like a mouth to
accept the lift inside

INT TUNNEL — CONTINUOUS 38

Looking down from within the tunnel Flashlights clack ON
among the team pointed up seeking a sense of destination

LOUISE
Is this how it always goes

COLONEL WEBER
Yes
(beat)
This is the easy part Our job was
recon Now it’s your job

This does nothing to comfort Louise
Above A distant indiscernible light

Ian studies the surface of the tunnel as they ascend moving
his flashlight beam over it In the light’s edge it seems
perfectly smooth but in the full beam there’s a texture

The lift stops One of the Techs cracks a GLOWSTICK and
throws it straight up

Louise watches it arc up then veer to one wall bounce
and then it settles AGAINST THE WALL Without falling

CAPTAIN MARKS
Here’s where it starts to get
strange

TAN
“Starts”

Everyone in the lift rises maybe an inch like balloons
Several of them immediately grab hold of the railing

Louise looks down at her HAZ-MAT boots Noticing the lower
gravity here How easy it would be to float away

That’s just what TECH 1 and TECH 2 do -- they grab their
gear bend at the knees and then launch upward in a floaty
slow-motion leap
Yellow 26a

Ian lets out a spontaneous little LAUGH as he sees them go
slowly righting themselves to the shift in gravity until
they’re both standing next to the glowstick

Captain Marks follows like it’s nothing like it’s a commute
to a job

Tan looks to Louise as if they’re both at the top of a ride
in a theme park and he’s looking to see if she goes first

Shes terrified So he jumps

Pink 27

Tan lands gently maybe twenty feet up He looks down at
them opens his mouth to say something can’t figure out an
answer so instead he turns to face the “top” of the tunnel

And he slowly walks after the Techs The light-and-dark in
the tunnel casts eerie reflections on his mask

All that’s left is Louise and Weber He can hear her
breathing shallow inside her suit

LOUISE
This I don’t I don’t know if

COLONEL WEBER
All right It’s okay

He holds onto her Firm Calm Wise
And then he launches them both

Louise looks up wide-eyed fearful she’s breaking the laws
of physics but tucked in next to Weber

They “swim” toward the others leaving the lift behind
And then they come to rest on the wallfloor of the tunnel

Louise finds her footing And her breath And they walk

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS 39

The chamber has no hard corners or edges Vaguely
rectangular

The room is bisected by a semi-transparent wall The wall can
be seen through but it renders the other side milky and
foggy-- it’s uncertain if the atmosphere on that side is some
sort of gas or if the barrier just makes it seem so

The TECHS with Weber and Marks quickly set up an arsenal of
video audio and other recording equipment to face this
glass-like partition Chemical sniffers IR and UV cameras
Barometers And most disturbingly an old-tech detection tool
among the high-tech A CANARY IN A CAGE

On the other side the room seems empty

Louise and Ian are speechless Their breathing is loud in
their ears Colonel Weber steps up to them

LOUISE
What happens now
Yellow 28

COLONEL WEBER
They arrive

LOUISE
And youve always worn this gear

COLONEL WEBER

LOUISE
So they haven’t really seen what we
look like

COLONEL WEBER
What are you getting at

LOUISE
Context

Comparative data streams on the Techs’ small monitors They
speak quietly into their headset mics behind the group

ENVIRONMENTAL TECH 1
Barometric down two point one

ENVIRONMENTAL TECH 2
No change in temperature

A sound from the other end of the room quiets everyone
They look to the wall squinting into the haze

TWO ALIEN FIGURES enter the room and cause a breathtaking
silence

They move in a foggy silhouette making it impossible to see
much detail They appear quadropedal with several appendages
along the torso that serve as arms The arms are spread
equally around their bodies like spokes of a wheel

One seems a bit shorter and stouter than the other
Otherwise their forms in the blurry mist are the same

As they approach their podium the forms undulate in ways
that make them seem like deep-water fish There is no hint of
cavitation around them yet the aliens move in a way best
described as “swimming”

The silhouettes settle behind the raised podium

Louise and Ian stare in awe of the creatures Louise tenses
realizing she’s leading the session Ian is the only one in
the group smiling and nodding to himself coolly confident
This is right where he’s supposed to be
Yellow 29

COLONEL WEBER

Louise tries to control her breathing
Shrouded in the mist beyond the glass the aliens stare back

Ian squints his eyes and leans in

IAN

(to Louise)
Are those arms

Louise steps forward Hesitant Close to the boundary

LOUISE
Hello

Beat No reaction The vague alien forms stand and wait They
are a good head taller than Louise

She clears her throat Still on the verge of an overload of
shock and stress

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Hello

The blurry shapes seem to undulate but it’s unclear if they
are moving or if there is some distortion in the partition
between their space and Louise’s

Louise gestures at them looking for some possible gesture in
response

LOUISE (CONTD)
Hello Can you hear me
(then)
Can you hear--

She’s interrupted by a sudden LOW NOISE from the other side
Followed by a strange endcap Flutter-tone

Tan and Louise both jump at the sounds startled

Yellow 30

LOUISE (CONT’D)
(to Weber)
Is this what they do

COLONEL WEBER
Sometimes
(beat)
What does it mean
Louise looks to Ian terrified at her own answer

LOUISE
I don’t know

The alien forms wait Two “arms” on one of them flex and
relax again seemingly random

LOUISE (CONTD)
If we can just establish a
common form of communication maybe
speech isn’t the--
She gestures at them again No reaction

INT “CLEAN ROOM” — DAY 40

Louise takes off her suit’s mask and gulps in air Her eyes
are red from nervous tears She looks physically drained

She pulls off a glove and notices tremors in her hand

Tan strides in and begins shedding his suit She watches him
Hears him softly laughing to himself

LOUISE
Tan

Tan faces her his hair wild and his eyes wilder

TAN
Can you believe it It’s just

Pink 31

He shakes his head and laughs again but Louise detects manic
in his voice now

Tan moves suddenly for the bathroom stall behind a divider
Louise hears him vomit into the toilet

Colonel Weber steps in pulling off his helmet Oxygen
escapes with a soft hiss He and Louise make eye contact

LOUISE
So Am I fired

Weber sits down opposite Louise

COLONEL WEBER
You did better than the last guy

LOUISE
That doesn’t make me feel better

COLONEL WEBER
Well you got until 1900 hours to
figure something out

LOUISE
What happens then

COLONEL WEBER
You go back in

Weber stands up to peel out of his suit

STAYING ON Louise looking like she just escaped a fire and
was told to run back into it

can hear Weber outside

COLONEL WEBER (0OS)
Did you two get any bright ideas on
how to talk to them this time

IAN Im really not that good at talking
to other humans

It’s all on Louise She sits up and looks away from the door
afraid to step out

And her attention lands on something On the wall

A SMALL WHITEBOARD Used for recording the HAZ-MAT suit
cleaning schedule Names and shifts in dry-erase markers

Blue Draft 33
Louise sees it and is seized by an idea

EXT BASE CAMPYELLOW TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER A5

Louise emerges in her HAZ-MAT suit cradling the whiteboard
and a dry-erase marker

COLONEL WEBER
What’s that for

LOUISE
A visual aid

COLONEL WEBER
For what

LOUISE
I’m never going to be able to speak
their words if they are talking
but they might have some form of
written language Or a basis for
visual communication

COLONEL WEBER
Okay

Where do you start

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — EVENING 46

CLOSE ON the whiteboard Louise has written the word “HUMAN”
in Large block letters

She stands by the whiteboard marker in her trembling hand
Ian is with her along with the team of TECHS behind them

THE VAGUE ALIEN FIGURES are back on the other side Quiet
Louise speaks and points to the word as she does

They both RETREAT from the screen deeper into the mist on
their side of the room

For a moment all is quiet Louise looks to Ian Ian looks to
the Colonel

CLOSE ON A NEEDLE-GAUGE Dead registering no frequencies
And then it SPIKES to the other side --

Before anyone can speak THE CANARY SQUAWKS in its cage
Its wings flutter frantically

INK GLOBULES float from the mist Like oil in glycerine
Thousands of drops horizontal black rain but intelligent

They all start to form something against the partition

A brilliant LOGOGRAM An inkblot coffee-cup stain with
mesmerizing fractal embellishments

The taller slimmer alien steps forward and says something
Click-flutter-tone

Louise smiles Nearly laughs Wants to cry
She just had her first real exchange with an alien

LOUISE (CONT’D)

Ian has taken control of a static video camera and holds it
at an angle that better captures the detail on the barrier

TAN
Absolutely It’s all downloading

Louise drops the whiteboard by the door

She doesn’t get more than her helmetmask off before Colonel
Weber steps in and confronts her

COLONEL WEBER
I said talk to them not teach them
how to read Do you understand what
this could mean

LOUISE
It means if I play my cards right
they’ll take some Shakespeare home
with them

COLONEL WEBER
Only now you’ve made it twice as
hard trying to learn how to speak
and read That takes longer

LOUISE
Wrong It’s faster

Louise starts marching past him Weber keeps up with her

COLONEL WEBER
I’m not saying no I’m asking why

LOUISE
It’s the only way this will work

COLONEL WEBER
Hey Everything you do in there I
have to explain to a room full of
men whose first and last question
is ‘How can this be used against
us’ So give me something

Louise gestures at the whiteboard

LOUISE
Kangaroo

COLONEL WEBER
What

LOUISE
In 1770 Captain James Cook’s ship
ran aground on the coast of
Australia He led a party into the
country and met the aboriginal
people

Pink 36

LOUISE (CONTD)
One of his sailors pointed to the
animals that hopped around with
their young in pouches and asked
what they were called The
aborigine replied “Kanguru”

COLONEL WEBER
What’s your point

LOUISE
It wasn’t until later that they
learned “Kanguru” means “I don’t
understand”
(re whiteboard)

I need this to make sure we don’t
misinterpret in there Otherwise
this will take ten times as long

Time wasted is the key phrase to convince Weber

COLONEL WEBER

All right I can sell that for now
But submit your vocabulary before
the next session

(beat)
And remember what happened to the
aborigines A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out

Weber walks off with Captain Marks
Ian steps up watching them go Grinning at Louise

TAN
Is that true The kangaroo story

LOUISE
No But it made my point

Louise starts walking out the clean room leaving Ian to
shake his head in admiration

This is aliens we’re talking about
The most important time in our

first contact with whoever is
inside this thing and who do we
have running the show The

that ruined our health care and
bankrupted our military

appears obviously shot with a long zoom lens

don’t even have guns We could be
facing a full-scale invasion and
our president is ready to roll over
and let them take our country-—-

Eastern news coverage of an armored division mobilizing

AGENT HALPERN
Problem is that shell dropped at
the border so when Pakistan rolled
out their army to secure the site
from locals India got all fussy
amassing two armored divisions at

LOUISE
We can’t get them to stand down

AGENT HALPERN
And tell them what exactly

COLONEL WEBER
Louise Ian this is Agent David
Halpern with the CIA

Weber guides Louise and Ian away from the bank of monitors
Its clear he doesn’t like dealing with Halpern

COLONEL WEBER (CONTD)
We need to gain ground today You
have your vocabulary list for me

LOUISE
I do

COLONEL WEBER
(examines her list)
You’re going to teach them your
name And Ian’s

LOUISE
It’s so I can learn their names If
they have names And so I can
introduce pronouns later

COLONEL WEBER
These are all grade-school words
Eat Walk Tool We need to get
more specific

LOUISE
Do you know what a Pulaski is

Weber makes a noncommittal noise and reviews the words
Ian reveals to Louise his sketch of an ALIEN

IAN

She’s right-- it’s useless until we
can demonstrate some basics first

COLONEL WEBER
We have one question What is their
purpose here on Earth It isn’t
complicated
(softening)
Help me understand

Louise goes to a larger whiteboard stationed nearby and
writes the question “What is your purpose on Earth”

LOUISE

Okay so this is where we want to
get Right This question

(off Weber’s nod)
To get there we have to make sure
they understand what a question is
and the nature of a request for
information along with the
response Then there is clarifying
the difference between a specific
you from a collective “you” We
don’t want to know why Joe Alien is
here we want to know why all of
them landed

Blue Draft 42

She writes frantically over the words in columns marking
relations with arrows As she speaks her voice gets louder
and more confident This is her area of expertise

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Purpose requires an understanding
of intent Which means we have to
find out if they make conscious
choices or if their motivation is
so instinctive they don’t
understand a “why” question and
biggest of all we need to have
enough of a vocabulary with them so
we understand their answer

Colonel Weber nods and surrenders to her Behind Weber Tan
grins devilishly at Louise even winks at her

COLONEL WEBER
All right all right I get it

Louise shirks out of the rest of her suit She’s wearing her
civilian clothes underneath

She takes a breath It doesn’t kill her Louise moves a step
toward the glass barrier

The heptapods advance closer to the barrier Curious For the
first time we can see a bit more detail more focus

Their skin is more mottled than a uniform color Their torsos
move slightly not from breath but as a jellyfish And the
tips of one heptapod’s “feet” are dark with ink

Everyone holds their breath a beat Slowly Louise puts a
hand on her heart and repeats

Flips it around and shows She’s drawn their symbol for

“human” next to the English word “HUMAN” and then a greater-

Because if I try to make sounds
like them I will end up insulting
their mothers

LOUISE (CONTD)
Wait Wait

She steps to the boundary and puts her hand on it

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Why are you here

Abbott crooks his head

Louise desperate looks back at the printer attached to the
still camera capturing everything written by the heptapods
She riffles through the pages looking for the words

TAN
What can I do

Louise gives him two print-—outs

LOUISE
Hold these up

Yellow 49

Abbott looks back at the door where Costello left Then at
Louise and Ian

Louise finishes drawing Shows the board to Abbott Puts it
against the boundary She’s attempted freehand drawing their
gorgeous logograms and she’s actually done a great job

It’s not quite the phrasing she hasn’t taught them “why” but
instead uses “heptapods purpose Earth” with a curl on the
logogram for Earth

Abbott stares a beat And writes on the podium

As the logogram glows on the divider Louise steps back in
shock She’s translated it already

IAN
What does it say

LOUISE
“Offer weapon”

The phrase sends a tense hush through the team

The unidentifiable light source in the interview chamber dims
and the transparent wall clouds until it’s fully opaque

Louise Ian Captain Marks and the other in-room Techs face
each other as if they’ve just learned a terrible secret

INT OPERATIONS TENTWAR ROOM -— DAY 62

An eruption of sound and chaos joining in mid-debate with
several people talking at once Halpern is among them

CAPTAIN MARKS LOUISE
But you saw what they wrote-- --using a word they don’t
fully understand

IAN AGENT HALPERN
It could just be a request-- --or a warning--

Over the din of everyone talking and no one truly listening
comes the booming voice of Weber in his best stern father

COLONEL WEBER
Enough
(as room quiets down)
I can’t agree with any of you when
you’re all talking at once Now I
want to hear theories Louise
Pink 50

LOUISE
We don’t know if they understand
the difference between a weapon and
a tool Our language like our
culture is messy In many cases
one thing can be both

TAN
In addition it’s possible they are
wanting us to offer them something
not the other way around Like the
first part of a trade

COLONEL WEBER
How do we clarify their intention
beyond those two words

LOUISE
I go back in there In thirteen
hours we go in and clear this up

AGENT HALPERN
Its more complicated than that

LOUISE
How is that complicated

AGENT HALPERN

Set aside our own reaction to the
message we have to consider the
other nations and how they will
interpret this

(pointing at monitor)
Like China Have you met General
Shang How about a little round of
“meet the scary-powerful men”

Halpern points at a profile photo of a distinguished Chinese
man in dress uniform GENERAL SHANG

AGENT HALPERN (CONT’D)
The call-sign for him is Big
Domino Because he’s a tastemaker
Whatever Shang does at least four
other nations will follow

LOUISE
Were on good terms with Shang

AGENT HALPERN
But we can’t say the same for other
nations where these ships have
landed And Russia has control of
two sites Twice the data
Yellow 51

LOUISE
How is that relevant to this

A LIEUTENANT enters to address Weber

LIEUTENANT
Colonel the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you

Weber reluctantly steps out Halpern takes over

AGENT HALPERN
We need to sit on this information
until we know what it means So we
aren’t sharing with our enemies
We have to consider the idea that
our ‘visitors’ are prodding us to
fight among ourselves until only
one faction prevails

LOUISE
There’s no evidence of that

AGENT HALPERN
Sure there is Just grab a history
book The British with India The
Germans with Rwanda They even got
a name for it in Hungary

Halpern’s cell phone rings and before he takes the call--

AGENT HALPERN (CONT’D)
We are a world with no single
leader It’s impossible to deal
with just one of us And with the
word “weapon” now

Louise pales Feeling like she just broke something She
looks for someone to talk to and finds Ian deep in thought
keeping his eyes on the twelve monitors

LOUISE
That was my doing I taught them
that So if we just go back in
tonight go in and and--

Frenzied activity at the monitoring station draws their
attention in time to see

AN EXPLOSION at one landing site the plume of the firecloud
lighting up the urban-located Shell--

Communications Team Members stand up now talking into their
headsets in four different languages--

ON THE CHINESE VIDEO STREAM a Scientist is forcibly pulled
away by a Chinese Intelligence Officer who yanks at a cable
and then the video feed BLACKS OUT

A moment later a panicked Russian Officer does the same to
their feed Two more black screens Siberia and Black Sea

Weber gets off the phone focused on the feeds

COLONEL WEBER
Whats going on What was that
explosion at Site Four

Halpern keeps his ear to his phone but answers

AGENT HALPERN

They aren’t speaking to anyone
Whatever they learned in their last
session has them spooked--

Halpern leans in at one station and orders a Team Member

Put us on radio silence

ON ONE SCREEN It’s their own tent the camera pointed at
Louise and Tan Louise rushes to the mic--

LOUISE

heptapods “offer weapon--”

But as she says “offer” the US SCREEN BLACKS OUT leaving
the other countries hanging

AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST

Louise whirls on Halpern--
LOUISE

talking to each other
AGENT HALPERN
You want to talk to them find out
what this means Please I will
sleep better if you do
He holds up the printout with the words “OFFER WEAPON”
Louise grabs the page from him and storms off to her desk
Ian (quietly boiling) passes by Halpern and hisses

shut out the world beyond

She bends over and takes a moment to refocus When she stands
upright she faces a suspicious Weber who’s come over

It reads in subtitled logogram “OFFER WEAPON”
Abbott and Costello make little movement No answer

IAN
This isn’t working

Louise speaks directly to Abbott stepping a bit closer

LOUISE
Are you offering us something

She holds up the whiteboard again
Another quiet conference between Abbott and Costello

More ink floats to the barrier to form a complex LOGOGRAM
followed by the translation in subtitles

“MUST LEARN MORE FROM IAN LOUISE”

currently blank Like a spreadsheet waiting to be filled

an apple because tomorrow she will be hungry”

How do you begin to craft a complex
statement like this The relation
each symbol has to another

(then)
You know what We’ve never seen
them write Only the result Let’s
see them in the act of writing

Louise returns to the tablet Erases the sentence on her
screen And then instead of preparing words and displaying
the result she triggers the “live sketching” option that
shows her writing the letters and words in real-time

She writes the sentence “Louise writes so heptapods can see
her writing”

Abbott and Costello crook their heads

Then Abbott approaches the transparent boundary which
becomes clearer than ever before

Captain Marks notices Tenses

CAPTAIN MARKS
(into mic)
One is approaching the boundary
with two uh limbs raised

Abbott reaches the boundary holding up two of his seven
“hands” He places them at two points on the transparent wall
and begins to draw Ink issues from his hands as he does

Abbott writes a heptapod sentence in real-time With two
hands simultaneously

It is poetry in motion A dance of ink He begins at opposite
ends and then writes phrases and symbols in a perfect pair
of arcs so that they connect as a circle at the end

LOUISE
Oh my god Nonlinear orthography

Ian catches up to what she’s saying

IAN
They’d have to actually think
nonlinearly then

Louise grabs a tablet synced to the large flatscreen and
draws in heptapod logograms She does it one-handed but
she’s quite good at it

COLONEL WEBER (VO)
(via intercom)
Explain

As she draws her logogram she walks him through it

LOUISE
Imagine trying to write a long
sentence with two hands starting
at either end To do that you’d
have to know every single word
you’re going to write and the
space all of it occupies

Ian struggles to find reference to her logogram

TAN
What is-- what are you writing

She completes the ornate symbol
LOUISE
I asked about predictability If

“before” and “after” mean anything
to them Or if they don’t know what

that means
Tan shuffles through notes on his tablet

the cap and dumps a heap at the end

TAN (CONT’D)

This line represents the population
of the whole history of humanity
Estimated at just over 100 billion
What that means is About eight
percent of every human who ever
lived is alive right now And that
puts us at this pileup at the end

EVERY SINGLE TV SCREEN is filled with footage of violence

Gunfire at the grounds of another alien site Riots at
another Naval maneuvers on the Indian Ocean

Weber hands Louise a set of headphones and replays a video

ON SCREEN Spy footage of two CHINESE MEN meeting at a camp
not unlike the Montana site Muddled voices in Mandarin
Louise translates

LOUISE
He’s saying each of the twelve is
offering advanced technology
(beat)
Spies report India and Sudan have
already received theirs Like sets

Blue Draft 76

LOUISE (CONTD)
Sets I don’t know what he means--
(beat)
Something about an advantage With
suits honor and flowers

The clip ends abruptly Weber takes the headphones back

COLONEL WEBER
We don’t know what it means
either But an hour ago China
scrambled fighters at airfields in
four different bases and Sudan is
following suit “Big Domino” is
about to start something

LOUISE
Following suit
(realizing)
Suits honor and flowers Colonel
those are tile sets in Mahjong Oh
god have they been using a game to
converse with their heptapods

COLONEL WEBER
Maybe Probably easier than trying
to teach Mandarin Why

LOUISE
Say I taught them chess instead of
English Every conversation is a
game every idea expressed through
opposition-- victory and defeat
You see the problem If all T ever
give you is a hammer

Weber looks back at the monitors suddenly getting it

COLONEL WEBER
-Everything’s a nail

Halpern enters riled up Steps up to Weber

AGENT HALPERN
May I have a word Colonel

Weber nods to Louise Dismissed

A86 INT SCIENCE TENT - MOMENTS LATER A86
Louise enters distraught Goes to her desk

ANGLE ON IAN engrossed in his study of previous sessions
until he hears Louise gathering papers at her desk
Blue Draft 77

He sees her through the timeline screen bisecting their
workspace It’s like the glass barrier in the chamber
After a beat he decides to approach her

IAN
Hey

LOUISE
Hey

IAN

How are you doing

She keeps gathering printouts of logograms Shoving material
into folders

LOUISE
Why do you want to know

IAN
Why Because I-- because you were
starting to scare me
(steps closer)
You would have done the same for
me if you were in my shoes

Louise turns to him now Vulnerable and mad about it But
refusing to cry in front of him

LOUISE
Oh so I should see things from
your perspective but did you ever
see it from mine Just once
(re Timeline)
You got the symbol for ‘humanity’
wrong Doesn’t that say it all

She walks around to the other side of the screen and makes
adjustments by touch

Tan watches from Louise’s desk on the other side and he
nearly gasps in surprise

From his POV the timeline is reversed And the logogram that
means ‘humanity’ now looks the same from either side

IAN
Louisetheir word is an ambigram
It reads the same front or back

LOUISE
It is Oh-- Youre right

He marvels at this mirror image of the timeline problem

Blue Draft 78

IAN
On your side the human race is at
the end of its time But here-- to
the heptapods—— we’re just getting
started

The low BASS TONE reverberates through the tents

CAPTAIN MARKS (0S)
Ten minutes to session Ian--
you’re up

Louise leans in to Ian to keep him focused on the problem in
front of him

LOUISE
How does that help us

Ian frowns thinking then in a sudden Eureka moment he
gets it Claps his hands-—-

IAN
My god It’s not a problem at all
it’s a choice

He charges off right out of the tent

LOUISE
Ian Ian wait——

EXT BASE CAMP — CONTINUOUS 87
Louise trails after Ian who’s headed right for the pickup

LOUISE
What choice

IAN
Thats what they’re saying It’s
like a warning label on a power
tool Whatever they’re offering us
we can use it to flourish for
millions of years or we can do
something stupid and end it all
right now

Halpern steps out of the Ops Tent with Weber and zeroes in on
Tan leading Louise for the Shell door

AGENT HALPERN
Doctor Banks

Tan grabs Louise by the hand He’s not going in alone

Blue Draft 79
IAN
Come on
Louise hurries after Ian

AGENT HALPERN
No one authorized you back inside--

But the two pile into a pickup and Ian peels out

Halpern moves for the second truck where two HAZMAT-suited
TECHS arrive looking confused -- the rest of Ian’s team
EXT “THE SHELL” — DAY A87
Ian slides the pickup to a stop close to the scissor lift
Louise hurries out on one side Ian following Neither of

them in suits or with respirators

In the distance the other truck is on approach leaving a
rooster tail of dust behind it

Ahead the scissor lift DESCENDS from its high perch at the
surface revealing Lasky and Combs in full suits

Tan and Louise climb in as they step out Louise makes eye
contact with Lasky

PRIVATE LASKY
You can’t go in there

IAN
She’s with me

Ian punches the ‘up’ button on the lift

Louise checks to see how close the other truck is but then
her attention drifts back to Lasky and Combs below

They both just stand and watch them clutching their rifles

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — MOMENTS LATER 89

Louise and Ian arrive to find Abbott already here advancing
for the glass barrier Abbott’s movement suggests an urgency

LOUISE
Abbott
Pink 79R

The timeline draws itself on the glass And beneath it a
symbol appears Louise points to it

LOUISE (CONT’D)
“Solve” It’s all on you now

TAN
Is there a symbol for “choice”
Both timelines are possible it all
depends upon what we choose to do
with their offer

Louise nods
But then the tablet powers down shorts out on its own

LOUISE
Wait what just--

Abbott writes on the barrier Adding to the previous
LOUISE (CONT’D)
“Solve here” He wants me to write

on the glass

IAN
Can you

LOUISE
It’s a complicated sentence Im
trying to figure it out
Louise approaches the boundary opposite Abbott

The wall becomes more and more transparent revealing Abbott
more intimately than ever before

The alien gestures at her
Louise tentatively puts up two hands then lowers one

IAN
What

LOUISE
I can’t I can’t draw both ends at
the same time

She holds her right hand up against the glass It reacts by
forming ink on Abbott’s side

As she does Abbott holds up one hand against the glass on
his end to the left of her position

Yellow 79B
Louise regards him curiously Then she takes a breath and
begins to draw one end of this elegant complicated circle

As she does Abbott draws on his end Working in the opposite
are toward Louise’s starting point

IAN
What is he doing

Louise’s eyes widen as she realizes
LOUISE
Hes being my other arm He’s

finishing my sentence

The two co-authors finish simultaneously connecting the arcs
of their logograms into a circle

REVEAL an angle showing Abbott’s hand perfectly aligned with
Louise’s only the transparent wall between them

UICK POP

INT LAKE HOUSE - HANNAH’S ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) AA89
Baby Hannah reaches up from her cradle her little infant
hand outstretched like Abbott’s Louise reaching down to let
Hannah grip mom’s pointer finger

INT INTERVIEW CHAMBER — BACK TO SCENE A89

Louise snaps out of that quick vision She takes a step back

LOUISE
That’s That’s it

Looking at it head-on the logogram is complete

Then A tapestry of heptapod logograms begin flowing across
the entire transparent wall like wallpaper patterns

They appear with dozens of GEOMETRIC EQUATIONS Circles
Angular shapes Equations in heptapod with Arabic numerals
around them like liner notes A waterfall of data It pours
down the screen

PRESSING IN on Ian who smiles broadly
IAN

Abbott begins miming the “walk” action they taught earlier
Simultaneously a new set of logograms form from ink
splattered harshly against the glass --

IAN
What is he saying

Louise approaches the barrier frowning

Meanwhile a faint BEEPING begins quickening somewhere in the
interview chamber

LOUISE
Those are our names
(translating)
Must leave
(to Abbott)
You’re asking us to go

She gets close now--

Ian approaches a DUFFEL BAG toppled by the glass barrier on
the floor getting closer to the sound--

Pulling it away to reveal Aset of wired C4 CHARGES stuck
against the glass-—-

IAN
Louise

Ian runs to grab Louise--

Louise looks back at Abbott-- he’s warning them--

Suddenly the gravity shifts in the chamber-- Louise and Ian
find themselves sliding AWAY from the barrier right back
into the tunnel--

Louise looks one last time at Abbott and sees

He’s pressing his seven-fingered hand to the glass once more
The way he did when she first shared her name

This image shrinks as gravity takes Louise away from the
chamber and then with a cacophonous BOOM-

The interview chamber is ENGULFED IN A FIREBALL with an
impact so hard Louise sees it SHATTER THE BARRIER--

Tan and Louise stop sliding but then the firecloud rolls
toward them out the chamber and into the tunnel--

DR KETTLER
Three broken ribs and a sprained
ankle but otherwise he’s fine

About two hours Been strangely
quiet ever since

Kettler tends to her examines her pulse and temperature

Weber came and got him maybe ten
minutes ago He wouldn’t leave
until he knew you were okay But
your whole tent is on the clock to

Ian stands at one computer cycling through some subset of
the data His button-down shirt is loose showing the tight
bandage wrap around his ribs underneath

IAN
Is this all of it The feed wasn’t
cut before the explosion

COLONEL WEBER
Not as far as we can tell

Tan is visibly relieved

IAN
We should combine my team with
Louise’s and get them all working
on this

COLONEL WEBER
What is it

IAN
I don’t know yet But they’re
finally speaking my language

Louise enters the tent shoving the flap aside
Weber sees her coming

COLONEL WEBER
Doctor Banks-—

LOUISE
We are not leaving

COLONEL WEBER
Glad to see you’re awake

LOUISE
(rolling through it)
We need to get back in there talk
to them explain what happened it
wasn’t our fault--

COLONEL WEBER
You’re not going back inside

Pink LOUISE
We have to

COLONEL WEBER
What happened in there was an
attack We can hope for the best
but I have orders to prepare for a
retaliation So we’re leaving in
twenty-four hours

LOUISE
That’s the wrong move As long as
they stay we have to stay We have
to keep talking

A low STRANGE TONE reverberates through the tent
This one is not the tone they’ve heard before
And it’s accompanied by a RUMBLE

EXT SCIENCE TENT - DAY

Louise Ian and Weber emerge from the tent to see

Yellow The Shell lifts higher into the sky

It rises vibrating everyone’s rib cages the air beneath it

undulating as if reflected on water

Then several hundred feet up it stops
And hovers Parked there Staring down

LOUISE
Well They’re not leaving

COLONEL WEBER
Why does this feel worse

EXT SCIENCE TENT — NIGHT

Outside the canopy of stars above is staggering

The Shell remains in the sky partially eclipsing the moon

Tilting down to find the Ops Tent bustling with activity

INT SCIENCE TENT NIGHT

He kicks at the back of his chair and storms off
Louise is too tired to get up and go after him Her eyes are
heavy and she’s still wounded from the explosion She rakes
her fingers through her long hair and stares at the screens
HANNAH (0S)
Whats this term here

INT LAKE HOUSE - LOUISE’S STUDY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 98

Louise reads papers at her desk She runs her fingers through
her short hair like she just did

Her study is walled with books and her desk allows her a
view through the open door all the way down the hall

Hannah (age 12) steps to the threshold Leans against it

HANNAH

like a technical term where we
make like a deal and we both get
something out of it

Put in just a little effort and
then kick me to the other parent

More than that

He triggers an animation sequence of data that looks like a
three-dimensional network of nodes Then one strand GLOWS
inside the network linking two disparate parts

IAN (CONTD)

It’s how they see everything How

they travel Except the shortest

path is outside space and time

With this we could build a space

ship with no rockets We’d just--

Connected to the Operations tent but made private walled
off from the screens and the noise Mainly it’s just a

Louise flanked by Ian confronts Colonel Weber at the
conference table with Agent Halpern

She holds up the printout

LOUISE
This is just one piece of it What
they’re telling us right here is
that ours is one of twelve We’re
part of a larger whole

AGENT HALPERN
Or we’re one of twelve contestants
for the prize

(to Weber)
Why do I have to talk to him

COLONEL WEBER
You did your job now he gets to
run the show

We need to talk to the other sites
and help them with whatever they’ve
gotten from the other heptapods

blacked out So are the other
nations We’re on our own
Pink 95

This is telling us the pieces go
together

AGENT HALPERN
And I’m telling you no one else
believes that

Halpern swivels his laptop around and shows a recording

AGENT HALPERN (CONT’D)
Two hours ago we pulled this audio
off a secure channel in Russia
Someone on the science team there
was broadcasting wide

He clicks playback and we see a screen go black with English
translation appearing as the recording plays over the sound
of pounding on the door--

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST (VO)
Their final words translate to
“There is no time many become
one” I fear we have all been given
weapons because we answered the
timeline wrong please if you--

With the CRACK of a gunshot the recording abruptly ends
Louise begins to fray at the edges Staving off panic

LOUISE
Well I mean there are ways to
interpret what he said

AGENT HALPERN
I don’t need an interpreter to know
what this means Russia just
executed one of their own experts
to keep their secrets

He clicks through to show on his monitor

Every Shell now hovers over their site From Hokkaido to
Wales the massive spheres hang in the air Waiting

LOUISE
“Many become one” could just be
their way of saying “some assembly
required”
Blue Draft 96

AGENT HALPERN
Why hand it out to us in pieces
Why not just give it all over
LOUISE
What better way to force us all to
work together for once

Halpern looks to the other people in the room Weber studies
him carefully Ian nods in support of Louise

AGENT HALPERN
Even if I did believe you how in
the world are you going to get
anyone else to play along and give
up their data
Ian jumps on this one

TAN
We offer our own in return

Halpern locks to Weber Is he serious

AGENT HALPERN
A trade

IAN
So it’s a non-zero-sum game

Louise hears this and it dawns on her--

her from the previous flashback

Louise sits forward with that same look of realization

LOUISE

Hannah stops Turns back around

Hannah shuffles back into her room

Louise slowly touches her face an even deeper question now
creeping into her mind Did I just alter my own past

Nobody locks horns with the CIA
like that What motivated you

Louise is still a bit lost reeling from the effect she just
had on her own memory

LOUISE

Weber is surprised and confused by this answer
They’re interrupted by Halpern who steps up with

AGENT HALPERN
Nine of the landing sites have gone
total comms blackout Only way to
reach them is to physically drive
there and yell at the border guard
Which we’re doing but it won’t be
fast enough

LOUISE
Theres gotta be some way to get a
message to them

AGENT HALPERN
To our allies maybe but at this
stage it’s too little too late
What we need is to get all the
nations online before one starts
global war and there’s no way for
us to reach them

to PUSH THE CLOUDS around it like a ripple on water

INT “THE SHELL” — CONTINUOUS A104

Ian grabs a pair of binoculars from an OFFICER and looks out
in the direction of where the Shell had been

She looks around for anything else in the chamber with her
No windows No views outside

Outside the walls of the chamber another metallic ROAR
Followed by a distant HIGH PITCH

Louise waits for a portal to open None do She’s trapped
inside this space

LOUISE

At her feet light sets the floor aglow

And then a luminous GAS seeps in and begins to rise around
her Filling the cylinder

Oh god-- oh god oh god--

Louise puts on the oxygen mask as the barrier rises up to her
shoulders then her neck and finally up over her head--

Louises hair drifts up around her face as if she were
underwater Louise breathes through the mask Looks around

A portal opens up opposite her Light shines on her face

INT “THE SHELL” -— CONTINUOUS 108

Louise steps out to a dimensionless sea of bright mist
Yellow 101

No walls or ceiling

She looks up to see what might be a heptapod drifting into
the white void far above her

Her breath is shallow She is in a truly alien place now
There is no reference for this experience

Something dark and enormous “swims” through the mist passing
by her always just far enough to make it impossible to see
clearly -- it could be a swarm of small things or something
the size of a blue whale

And then a heptapod approaches from behind her Louise spins
around in time to see it as its seven limbs advance to her

Beat She finally controls her breathing

LOUISE
Costello

Costello stands with limbs poised before her

Then the mist clears a bit revealing more of his heptapod
body The limbs and torso What seemed to be the entire form
of the alien Not so It is more like the fingers and hand of
a much larger being

Costello towers over her She looks up in awe

And then it writes on the invisible floor beneath them With
two fingers Ink sluicing out from them into a logogram

SUBTITLES “Louise”
Louise takes a breath

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Where is Abbott

Costello moves the ink around with one appendage and a new
logogram forms

SUBTITLES “Abbott is dead”

I’m sorry We are sorry

The logogram ink shifts again Louise looks down to read it

SUBTITLES “Abbott chooses to save Louise and Ian”

Another ink-shift for a second logogram
SUBTITLES “Louise has question”

SUBTITLES “Message here Louise has weapon”

Costello stares down at her

Inky globules drift in from the mist showering not randomly
but into patterns Circles A hundred logograms A thousand

Click-click flutter-whisper-tone SUBTITLES “The story of

Louise marvels at it

A chain of them light up at her feet shifting for her to
see Louise reads it aloud

LOUISE (CONT’D)
“Three thousand years from this
point humanity helps us We help
humanity now Returning the favor”
(to Costello)
You know both your past and your
future How

A podium screen rises between Louise and Costello The
timeline riddle appears Up close more details are visible

It’s more artful than a simple line segment with a large
bulbous flourish at one end There are little stems and curls
along the line And then that familiar logogram--

SUBTITLES “Solve”

LOUISE (CONT’D)
Did we answer wrong

A NEW SERIES OF SYMBOLS “Many answers given Many become
one Only one matters”

The message the Russian Scientist translated in part Louise
looks back at the timeline

LOUISE (CONTD)
But I don’t understand it’s time--
(then)
Time Wait Is it What’s the
logogram for time

Louise is seized with a realization She reaches out and
touches the timeline on the screen Nudges it It moves

From both ends she wraps the line into its own circle an
exact representation of the logogram It pulses when she
completes the action

Costello turns to her some of his arms float in the air like
the strands of Louise’s hair Despite his unearthly figure
he seems to look upon her with tenderness A final logogram
forms on the floor between them

SUBTITLES “You already have You choose life”

The THRUM increases in urgency That same cylinder rises
around her feet to encase her once again

LOUISE (CONT’D)
I don’t understand-- WAIT--

With a ROAR the cylinder seals her up into darkness

EXT BASE CAMP - DAY 109
From the top of the hill the massive Shell begins to TURN on
itself Rotating yet remaining in place Like spinning a
billiard ball on its axis

The ovoid craft reverses its hemispheres until finally it’s
sitting upside-down from its previous position

Louise emerges from behind the hill running toward us Her
hair is damp from the exposure to the alien atmosphere

Three pickup trucks rush toward her SIX MEN in full HAZMAT
suits grab LOUISE as the spaceship starts to leave the
ground with an ASTONISHING SOUND

Tan is among the men He calls her name but it’s drowned out
by the sound of the ship overhead

The spaceship then disappears in the clouds

Everyone outside base camp stares up at the sky every face
fretting and worried about what it means

Weber is among the six He steps close to Louise grim
COLONEL WEBER
You got everyone’s attention with
your little field trip

IAN
I hope you got good news too

Captain Marks rushes to Weber
CAPTAIN MARKS
Sir We’re getting the order from
command to evacuate immediately

COLONEL WEBER
What for

CAPTAIN MARKS
Big Domino

Captain Marks and Weber move for the War Room tent
Louise gives Ian a pained look Like she’s lost and afraid

LOUISE
Tan I don’t know what it means

Louise wobbles a step Ian holds onto her

IAN
Whoa now I got you
Louise looks down at her boots--

They’re covered in mud from the slog across the field--

110 EXT LAKE HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK) 110

Louise stands on the back patio one hand on a deck post Her
boots are covered in mud She looks around It’s raining

A 7-year-old Hannah comes in from the rain and sits down on
the bench at the patio

Louise reaches up and feels the length of her hair Looks at
her hands Notes her wedding ring-- she’s still wearing it

HANNAH (0S)
Help me mommy

Hannah struggles to get her muddy shoes off

Louise bends down and starts to work the laces

LOUISE
Baby What day is it do you know
HANNAH
Sunday
(then)
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy
did

Louise snaps back to full attention on her daughter

LOUISE
Hannah honey your father didn’t
leave you You’1l spend time with
him this weekend

HANNAH
He doesn’t look at me the same way
anymore

Louise touches Hannah’s hair She has so much love for her
daughter

LOUISE
Oh god I’m That was my fault
I told him something he wasn’t
ready to hear

HANNAH
What

LOUISE
Believe it or not I know something
that’s going to happen I can’t
explain how I know I just do When
I shared it with Daddy he got real
mad Said I made the wrong choice

HANNAH
Why What’s going to happen

LOUISE
It has to do with a very rare
disease And it can’t be stopped
Kind of like how you are when you
get focused on swimming or poetry
or any of the amazing things you
share with the world

HANNAH
I’m unstoppable

Said like a little mad scientist Louise brings Hannah in
close to hide the fact that she’s trying not to cry

Louise breathes in the smell of Hannah’s hair

INT SCIENCE TENT - MOMENTS LATER 112
The translators scientists and techs are gone here ARMED
SOLDIERS now populate the place tearing down all non-
essential material as fast as possible Halpern supervises
Louise rushes in and gets to a keyboard at her hutch She
calls up the heptapod data on the screens Spreads it to
every available screen Loops and whorls of logograms all
strung together like DNA strands Geometric formulae animate
around the cursive writing A wall of alien graffiti
Ian hurries in behind Louise

cracked maybe one percent of it

Louise’s eyes snap open and she takes in the sight of all
the alien symbols once more

She lets out a ragged breath in awe of it

LOUISE
I can read it

Ian I know what it is

A new SIREN now begins to wail around the campsite Louise
and Ian look up unsure what to do

Colonel Weber enters and marches for them with Captain Marks
behind him--

COLONEL WEBER
You two We’re evacuating you right
now Come on

TAN
What’s happening

COLONEL WEBER
War that’s what

Weber grabs onto them both and wills them into motion

LOUISE
Wait-- I figured out the gift

COLONEL WEBER
Good for you

He ushers them outside--

113 EXT BASE CAMP — HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS 113

-and they keep marching for the helipad despite Louise
trying to slow things down

LOUISE
Its their language They gave it
all to us It’s in twelve parts
because I separated their first
symbol into twelve segments-- and
they knew I would Understand

COLONEL WEBER
So we can learn heptapod if we
survive Not much of a gift

Blue Draft 109

LOUISE
(emphatic)
When you learn it truly learn it
you perceive time the way they do
Its nonlinear

Weber stops as they’re two dozen feet from the chopper He
has to shout over the sound of the rotors and the siren

COLONEL WEBER
I see we are out of time We did
our best but it wasn’t enough The
dominoes are falling now

Weber gestures at Ian to suggest Get her on the chopper
Then he turns and hurries back for the ops tent

Louise stands rigid with tension Ian tugs at her

IAN
Come on

Louise whirls around to face Ian but when she does--

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT 114

--she is dressed in a RESPLENDENT RED EVENING GOWN Her hair
is done up She looks stunning

All around her is a cocktail party in full swing Classical
music plays from a live band nearby

Louise looks around and takes in the ambiance A dozen
national FLAGS hang on the walls as a symbol of unity On a
stage (currently unoccupied) that heptapod logogram for
“time” is on prominent display

The crowd of PARTYGOERS is international and dressed up
One of them sets their sights on Louise and advances A
distinguished Chinese man in a tailored tuxedo She has

seen him before on monitors GENERAL SHANG

GENERAL SHANG
Doctor Banks what a delight

LOUISE
General Shang The pleasure is
certainly mine

They shake hands but Louise offers a slight bow

GENERAL SHANG
Your President said he was honored
to host me at the celebration but
I confess I am only here because I
wanted to meet you in person

LOUISE
Me Well I’m flattered

GENERAL SHANG
Eighteen months ago you did
something remarkable Something
not even my superior has done

LOUISE
What was that

GENERAL SHANG
You changed my mind In a way you
are the reason for the unification
All because you reached out to me
on my private number

LOUISE
Your private number General I
don’t know what uh

Shang shows her his sleek SMARTPHONE It’s open to an ID
screen with a number She accepts it staring at the screen

GENERAL SHANG
Now you do I do not claim to know
how your brain works but I believe
it’s important you see that

LOUISE
(beat)
Wait I called you didn’t I

GENERAL SHANG
You did And you spoke to me I
will never forget what you said

LOUISE
General you must forgive me I’ve
had a bit to drink tonight I might
need a reminder

GENERAL SHANG
Yes You warned me of this as well

He looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is
eavesdropping Then he leans close to her

Buff 111-112

She turns her head so he can speak into her ear

The classical MUSIC plays and the other Partygoers chat
providing a drone of noise

Louises eyes widen She puts her hand over her mouth

Above the music and chatter that high RINGING TONE builds up
again overtaking it all--

Louise blinks and--

EXT MONTANA LANDING SITE — DAY 115

She’s right back where she was a moment ago Ian tugs at her
to get into the helicopter

Louise sucks in a breath like she was just pulled from cold
water The memory of the future leaves her shaking

But she doesn’t follow him She turns and runs for the tents
Ian runs after her

Are you all right

Louise is simply overcome by the emotion of what she just
experienced She looks at Ian in an entirely new way It’s a
moment where she wants to tell him everything and doesn’t
know where to start

And there’s a tsunami of joy sorrow pain and hope hitting
her as she realizes where she is again

Finally she nods at Ian wiping her face Tenderly

your whole life start to finish
Would you change things

I’m changing that right now

Tan is just as tender with her

stars for as long as I can
remember and you know what’s
surprised me the most It’s not

That’s all it takes for Louise She puts her arms around Ian
and kisses him on the mouth

Ian shifts from a kiss to a tight hug when Louise hugs back--

it both forwards and backwards and
it’s still the same
