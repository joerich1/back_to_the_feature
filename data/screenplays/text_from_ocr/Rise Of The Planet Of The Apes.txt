EYES Expressive alive Human

No They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE BRIGHT EYES

EXT GROVE OF TREES -—- DAY

She sits in a tree with ALPHA her mate large and muscular
a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER LIKE A
SHOOTING STAR

Around them under the TREE CANOPY a COMMUNITY OF
CHIMPANZEES naps eats plays

EXT WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle
They’re working towards the GROVE visible in the distance

As they near it the LEADER points sending the MEN moving
quietly NETS and RIFLES ready

EXT CANOPY - DAY
Alpha sits up sensing something BIRDS take sudden flight

He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING FEAR
ignites the community -— but too late

POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING horses’ hooves kicking up
dirt CHIMPS SCATTER

Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha’s side but he bares his
teeth and sends her off

Then he drops landing firmly on the clearing floor All
around him POACHERS pursue terrified apes nets swinging

MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
an aggressive show A futile attempt to protect the tribe

Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
CHIMP He streaks across the clearing KNOCKS THE POACHER
FROM HIS MOUNT

Alpha POUNDS his CHEST letting out a BATTLE CRY - trying to
rally a counter-attack

But the other chimps pay no heed There’s no organization to
the defense It’s chaos

SHOTS RING OUT The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop one by
one Others take off
Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing dragged off ina
net He RUSHES to save her leaps in the air

A SHOT RINGS OUT

BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE
AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND LIKE A STONE

FADE TO WHITE

TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us
FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
red hair under a sterile cap

Franklin reaches for us smiles

FRANKLIN
Here we go Bright eyes

A MIST fogs our view for a moment

CAROLINE e
to be

Not too much She needs
calm but alert

VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
Go ahead - send her through

A LOUD HUM and we start moving sliding into a tunnel - a
tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top

Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK
Bright Eyes

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

WILL RODMAN - late twenties lab coat over a T-shirt and
jeans - stands at the glass watching the terrified
chimpanzee slide into the machine

The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress

INT WHITE ROOM —- DAY

Another tech DONNIE - skinny tattooed - controls the
machine sending the restrained animal into the scanner

Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan The bag’s

(opening valve)
Starting the therapy

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP
The image starts to shake Concerned he looks to the other
room - where he can see the CHIMP’S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

RESTRAINTS

FRANKLIN
She’s convulsing

Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube listens to Bright
Eyes’ heart

WILL
(into intercom)
Please keep the monkey still

He focuses back on the monitor

CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
She’s not a monkey

Will looks from the monitor to Caroline His look is
intense tough to read She blushes slightly at the heat of

his gaze

CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT’D)
Shes an ape Chimpanzees
gorillas and orangutans they’re
all apes
WILL
Good to know Just keep it from
moving

Shes stung wonders why does he have to be such a jerk
sometimes

He’s oblivious to this instead intent on getting the scan
right The green liquid moves through the chimp’s neck

TECHIE
Here we go

Will stares at the scan his eyes willing the test to
succeedthe green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP’S BRAIN

CHEER FROM THE GROUP
Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
across his face He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
the others

We‘re on our way

Good work

INT WHITE ROOM - DAY

CAROLINE
What is this

Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes who
sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM a lit-up board with
colorful symbols

Bright Eyes presses a button

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Tree

SUPER “ONE MONTH LATER”
Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn

CAROLINE
And this

The chimp presses another button

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn
CAROLINE
Where does the acorn come from

Bright Eyes considers then presses a button

ELECTRONIC VOICE

Acorn
CAROLINE
Yes but where does the acorn come
from
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn
CAROLINE
No -

Bright Eyes interrupts now pressing three buttons

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Acorn Tree Acorn

The chimp looks at Caroline who’s stunned trying to process
the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED Then she presses
another button

ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONTD)
Surprise

The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes’ eerily human-
like gaze - is somehow CREEPY The IMAGE FREEZES and we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WILL’S OFFICE

Diplomas on the wall books everywhere Bright Eyes looks
out at Will from a computer screen He’s got two CT SCANS
sitting on the desk in front of him

CAROLINE
We started the therapy four weeks
ago This was yesterday

Will’s studying the scans They look good Real good

CAROLINE (CONT’D)
There’s been clear cell growth
Both on the frontal lobe and the
neocortex

She’s purposely standing close in order to point this out
He notices but doesn’t respond - there’s history between them
and he’s regretting that - gets in the way
WILL
I see that But I don’t understand
the primate behavioral norms She
knows an acorn’s a seed Wouldn’t
any monkey know that

CAROLINE
No - it’s conceptual Acorn gives
us a tree which gives us an acorn

WILL
Abstract thought

CAROLINE
In a chimpanzee Unheard of

Will turns the possibilities over in his mind Caroline
moves away from him He barely notices her now

EXT

CAROLINE (CONT’‘D)
You’re calling her a monkey just to
piss me off aren’t you

WILL
Start the other’s on the 112
(beat)
And double this one’s dose

WILL’S HOUSE NIGHT

Will pulls up in front of his house

Set in a hillside neighborhood it’s neat nondescript The
home of a bachelor who hasn’t given it much thought

As Will pulls into the driveway WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER
AND OVER ON A PIANO
INT WILL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

WALTER RODMAN 60 sits at the piano dressed in a robe
stabbing at the key with his finger

Will enters his posture almost visually changing with the
emotional weight of this man his father

WILL
Hey Dad

Walter looks up whispers

WALTER
John is that you

WILL
It’s me Will

WALTER
As thou dost Anthony
(staring at the keys)
-he hears no music No music

He’s been doing that all day

A Home Aide enters grabs her coat This is IRENA

IRENA
He found an old book of his

She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walters
pocket He snatches it from her puts it back

IRENA (CONT’D)
(shrugging on coat)
I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
so much Mr Walter

WILL
My mother was the one She liked
Shakespeare

IRENA
(kisses him)
Good night Walter hone-ee
She heads out Will gently takes his father’s arm

WILL
Come on Dad
INT WALTER’S ROOM - NIGHT
Will helps his father change into pajamas

WILL
Remember I told you we were using
Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
the apes Well the therapy seems
to be working We’ve seen definite
signs of adult brain neurogenesis

Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top

WILL (CONTD)
Board of Directors is coming in a
couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
that’s clinical trials

Walter gives no hint he’s even listening much less
understanding what Will’s saying

WILL (CONTD)
Human trials Dad Soon

WALTER
I rather tell that what is to be
feared than what I fear for
always I am Caesar

There’s no way to reach him tonight Still Will tries

WILL
I’m going to make you better - I
swear it

His father looks at him A moment of recognition

WALTER

WILL
(disappointed)
No Dad it’s me Will

Will helps the old man under the bedcovers

WILL (CONT’D)
John’s gone

He moves to the door pausing to take in the diplomas on the
walls - Walter’s name on all of them (Physics Astronomy)

Will looks at his father lying there on his back staring up
at the ceiling The once brilliant man now slipping away

INT WILL’S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

Its late Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
beside numerous papers charts and Will’s computer

He looks exhausted gulps from a cup of coffee as he works
INT PRIMATE LAB - DAY
Franklin moves from cage to cage greeting the apes
FRANKLIN
Good morning Felix Bam Bam
Monty Hey - what’s the matter
don’t like my cooking

SUPER TWO WEEKS LATER

He pauses in front of Bright Eyes huddled at the back of her
cage

FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
You okay back there

CAROLINE
Something wrong with Bright Eyes

FRANKLIN
I’1l1 check on her when we’re done

Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY -— into the
next room where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner

Lucky’s head is shaved exposing a long curving scar on his
cranium

From Bright Eyes’ vantage point she can see through the open
door as Luckys strapped down

EXT GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack hair
brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR

JACOBS
You could at least try to look
excited

Wills too nervous to look excited He eyes the FOUR SUITS
disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS

WILL
I’m not good with this stuff

Jacobs puts a hand on Will’s back leads him inside
JACOBS
Youll do fine Just speak
English Keep the science simple

INT LAB - SAME

From the back of her cage Bright Eyes watches through the
open door as the ape on the table convulses

CAROLINE
Okay Back it out

DONNIE
Your turn

Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO
DONNIE CAN’T OPEN THE CAGE

DONNIE (CONT’D)
c’mon Let go -

She understands what he wants but she won’t do it THAT’S
WHEN HE NOTICES HER HANDS ARE BLOODY

DONNIE (CONT’D)
Hey Something’s wrong with number
four

Franklin looks over - he’s still dealing with Lucky on the
table

FRANKLIN
Be right over -

Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes There’s something
different in her face today Rage Force of will

DONNIE
What‘s the matter with you

INT BOARDROOM - SAME
Will stands at the head of a table A BIG PLASMA SCREEN

behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN As Will speaks
he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER

WILL
(awkward)
Alzheimer’s affects the entire
neocortex the hippocampus and
large subcortical regions of the
brain

INT LAB - SAME

Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff Once more he tries
to open the cage once more she yanks it shut

Again he tries and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS
HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS

DONNIE
Hey

Now Donnie’s smashed up against the bars Hard The other
apes begin to SCREECH

Donnie hasn’t panicked quite yet but he’s about to

DONNIE (CONT’D)
Someone get her off of me

CAROLINE
Hang on -

Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
over He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY

INT BOARDROOM - DAY

Will continues his presentation Stevens looks around at the
board members they’re lost

WILL
In the past it’s been impossible
to target specific areas both
because of the Blood Brain Barrier -

Jacobs stands interrupting Will

JACOBS
What Dr Rodman has done is to
invent a virus that can for the
first time cross the membrane that
protects the brain and deliver a
genetic therapeutic payload

WILL
(trying to sell)
This ‘payload’ would directly
affect the areas of memory higher
function - and of course the
motherlode intelligence

The board members stare trying to comprehend

BOARD MEMBER
Meaning

WILL
Meaning
(deep breath here)
If Phase 2 goes as planned we’re
looking at a cure for Alzheimer’s

With an elbow prompting from Jacobs Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
effect

INT LAB - DAY

DONNIE
Shes breaking my hand

CAROLINE
Let go Bright Eyes Youre
hurting him
She tries to help pull Donnie away

CAROLINE (CONT’D)
Let go

In the next room Franklin’s having troubles of his own
LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES’ CAGE AND
THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY
HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB DRAGGING HIS LEASH
FRANKLIN
Lucky no Stop
(to Caroline)

Hit the alarm

Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it

DONNIE’S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO

INT LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
of a corridor They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
scampers - unattended - down the hall

GUARD 1
Uh oh

Guard 2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN
SILENT AGONY PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE CAROLINE TRYING TO
GET HIM FREE

GUARD 2
Hey Len

Bright eyes is pulling Donnie’s arm right from its socket

Donnie falls to the floor at Carolines feet

EXT GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
grounds He leaps over a car then heads for the nearest
building

INT BOARDROOM - DAY

The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will’s
pronouncement

BOARD MEMBER
What about the safety of the virus

WILL
Perfectly safe We’re using the
most stable -
A COMMOTION outside Someone SCREAMS
Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW

WILL (CONT’D)
NO

Lucky turns on Will with a growl lurching toward him and
pinning him to the wall It happens fast

The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw exposing DEADLY
INCISORS

BAM BAM BAM Security Guard 1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK
The chimp turns leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again

Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will’s dreams -
collapses on the boardroom table

EXT GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

Rain and fog An AMBULANCE pulls out past POLICE CRUISERS
and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS

Will - face cut clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
and walks through the chaotic aftermath He watches Caroline
walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie his shoulder
packed in ice

He spots Jacobs who looks wrecked He hurries over to him

WILL
Are they gone

JACOBS
Long gone

Will knows the answer but has to ask anyway

WILL
Did they say anything before they
left I mean about Phase 2

JACOBS
Look around you for Christ sakes
Well be lucky if we don’t go to
jail

Will’s gutted - devastated

WILL
But we’re so close

JACOBS
You think you’re the only one whos
got something at stake here I’ve
got my own skin in this game

WILL

What happened had nothing to do
with the 112

(desperate to clarify)
Take an already aggressive animal
make it smarter - you’re going to
get a potentially dangerous
situation -

JACOBS

What makes you so damned positive
about that

(pauses for emphasis)
What if this drug does things you
don’t understand Are you going to
take responsibility for that
Because I’m sure as hell not going
to

Here Will hesitates

JACOBS (CONT’D)
We‘re not ready for human trials
Hell we weren’t ready for monkey
trials

WILL
Theyre apes

JACOBS
This is what we’re going to do
Youre taking a sabbatical I’11
let the board handle the lawsuit
When this blows over I’ll bring you
back and we’ll start over - we’ll
do it right this time With mice
Tiny mice that can’t hurt anybody

Will finds to his dismay that he’s got nothing to say

INT LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

Will stands at the fringes of the room watching MEN IN
HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

His work destroyed

EXT BACK LOT BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

Will climbs into his truck and pauses He reaches into a
jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - ITS THE VIAL of 112 HE
USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE

TAP AT THE WINDOW Franklin’s face appears

Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket rolls down the
window

FRANKLIN
Show you something boss

WILL ©
I don’t work here anymore
Franklin

FRANKLIN
I just put down fifteen animals
Dr Rodman The least you could do
is give me a moment of your time

Will’s shoulders sag with exhaustion It’s been a long
devastating day

WILL
Of course

INT PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

The cages are empty the doors open Will notes used
SYRINGES on the table filled body bags lined up on the
floor

It’s a creepy horrible scene

FRANKLIN
They’re all gone

WILL

I’m sorry Franklin Genuinely
SOrry

What’s he got to do to get the hell out of there

Franklin ignores him steps inside Bright Eyes’ cage He
moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket

At first Will doesn’t understand what he’s looking at The
lighting’s dim and the thing’s so small

But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HES LOOKING AT AN INFANT
CHIMPANZEE

Will stares at it for a long moment his brain overloaded
WILL (CONT‘D)
It’s impossible How could a full-
term gestation go unnoticed
FRANKLIN
They carry small Must have been
pregnant when they brought her in

Will tries to get his mind around the situation ©
WILL
Who else knows about this
FRANKLIN
No one
(beat)

I‘d bring him home but my brother-
in-law works for security He’d
rat me out in a second

Thats when Will realizes

WILL
You want me to take him

FRANKLIN
He’s an orphan now

WILL
I could be thrown in jail He’s a
chimpanzee who’s been exposed to a
possibly dangerous drug

FRANKLIN
You don’t believe that

WILL
Doesn’t matter what I believe

FRANKLIN
Just for a couple days Until I
can find a sanctuary

WILL
That’s not possible

FRANKLIN
I heard you outside fighting to
keep them alive

WILL
I was talking about the work my
research -

FRANKLIN

She was just trying to protect him

WILL
What

i7

FRANKLIN
Bright Eyes - the mother That’s
why she wouldn’t let anyone into
her cage

Will looks down at the helpless baby

WILL
I’m sorry Franklin - I’m sorry -
but there’s nothing I can do here
He’s got to be put down like the
others

FRANKLIN
Tell you what Doc
(producing a syringe)
I’m done for the day So you be my
guest

Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will

It’s quiet Will can hear the baby’s WHEEZY breath He
enters the cage kneels beside it regards his tiny body his
little hands

Will readies the needle brings it close to the chimp’s
belly but there’s no way he can go through with this

Angrily Will tosses the needle aside Turns to Franklin who
watches from outside the cage

WILL
Two days Then you have to figure
it out
INT WALMART - NIGHT

A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
cart

Will moves down the aisle in a daze the baby chimp - covered
in a blanket - plastered to his chest

He stops at the powdered formulas overwhelmed by the array
of choices

She doesn’t wait to hear his excuse just moves down the
walk her footfalls pointed and angry

He pauses there Apparently no end to this bad day

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Will dumps the baby goods on the counter heads for the
refrigerator The infants still plastered to his chest

Will turns on the HOT WATER SHUTS the door Holding the
limp feeble chimp in his arms he puts down the toilet seat

Will looks down at the chimp struggling for breath The
room fills with STEAM

CUT TO

A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD He stands at the top of
a tree an alpha male eyeing the CHIMPS around him

In a sudden BURST of movement the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF
FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force a FREIGHT
TRAIN OF THREAT POWER AND VIOLENCE

Teeth bared in a terrifying display the ape easily
intimidates all the chimps around him

REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL’S WATCHING
THEM ON HIS LAPTOP

Abruptly he closes it Looks down at the infant so peaceful
in his arms

SUPER “TWO YEARS LATER”

SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH

INT HOUSE - DAY

The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
bathroom hiking up a pair of shorts WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH

THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture

The house looks warmer cluttered more lived-in

The chimp arrives at a hallway where he leaps into the air
and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling

As his weight pulls it down there’s a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
LADDER opens from above WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into

INT ATTIC - DAY

-the attic Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT

WIFE and young DAUGHTER ALICE then climbs into the cab with
his carry-on suitcase

Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy’s

INT GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
progress Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity

The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads The mouse stops
studies the cone

LAB TECH
Is he going to turn left or
right

The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
piece of cheese Will does his best to hide the excitement
blooming on his face

WILL
There it is Restored cognitive

STEWART
What’s he saying

WILL
He’s hungry

Caesars angling to climb off the examining table Will
sends him a look - cut it out

STEWART
He seems extremely intelligent
How many words does Caesar sign

Beat

WILL
You know the basics

CAESAR
Soft-serve

STEWART
I’ve heard of apes learning up to a
hundred and fifty words Is he
good with puzzles

Will hesitates

WILL
He’‘s pretty good

STEWART
Well Caesar’s healthy obviously
happy Youre doing a great job
with him
(doesn’t want to alarm)
But there is an anomaly I noticed

WILL
Like what

STEWART
When I was examining his eyes I
noticed a strange green
pigmentation

WILL
Green

His heart starts to pound

STEWART
Green Never seen it before

She hands Will an OTOSCOPE

STEWART (CONT’D)
Take a look

Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough finds
FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112

STEWART (CONT’D)
It’s faint can you pick it up

He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned She eyes him

STEWART (CONT’D)
You alright Want a glass of
water

WILL
No thanks
(embarrassed)
Sure that would be good

She gets him one Concerned Caesar comes over
WILL (CONT’D)

Forgot to eat today Not a big
deal

Stewart hands him the glass He downs it
WILL (CONT’D)
(to Caesar)
I’m fine

Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck Feels good

STEWART
Carotid pulse is running a little
fast

WILL

For a human or a chimpanzee
First time he’s seen her smile It lights up her face

STEWART
Gotta remember to eat

INT MOVING CAR - DAY

WILL (0S)
You have to move the whole tower to
another peg one block at a time

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Walter’s parked in front of the TV not watching it

Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
wooden poles There are four colored blocks threaded on the

first pole stacked biggest to smallest making a ‘tower’

Irena stands next to Will watching Caesar Theres also a
CAMCORDER on a tripod

WILL
Here’s the hard part you can’t put
a larger block on top of a smaller
one

Caesar studies the puzzle

WILL (CONTD)
Understand

Caesars already started He methodically begins moving
blocks from one pole to another pausing backtracking
getting it right never a bigger one on top of a smaller

Will watches increasingly amazed as he re-creates the tower
on a different pole It’s easy for him

Finished Caesar looks up at him Will fumbles in his
pocket HANDS CAESAR SOME MandMS

WILL (CONTD)
(stunned)
He did it in fifteen moves

TRENA
What‘s the best score

WILL
Fifteen

Will looks over at Walter who’s staring at the wall

IRENA
(amazed)
I wonder where he gets such talent

WILL
(eyes on Walter)
It was passed down from his mother

INT WILL’S STUDY - NIGHT

Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT

(into computer mic)
At age two Caesar appears to exceed
his mother’s aptitude He signs
over three hundred words He
exhibits no visible side effects
from the therapy

INT GARAGE - NIGHT
Will flips on a light Enters Closes the door behind him

Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL PADLOCKED
REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it Opens the door

Inside WE SEE THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Will sits on the edge of the sofa the VIAL of 112 in his
hand He’s deep in agonized thought

Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
LIQUID Then he stands walks to a closed door

EXT BACK YARD - DAY

The movement of a SWING Caesar’s strapped in it and WE
NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE’S GROWN OLDER

SUPER TWO YEARS LATER

Caesar’s features are more mature He appears more like a
“little boy” - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN

Back and forth Caesar goes as high as he can manage

At the height of his forward motion he peers down into the
neighbor’s yard where for just an instant HE CAN SEE TODD
PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID

At the height of his backward motion he catches another
glimpse

Caesar pumps his legs eager to get a better look

EXT BACK YARD - DAY

SQUEAK SQUEAK of the SWING the PIANO FAINT from out here
Caesar studies the harness that’s keeping him in the swing
There’s a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back He
undoes the one on his right side CLICK Then the left
side CLICK

Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Will returns to his sandwich making It takes him a moment
to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING

The color drains from his face

Caesar stands at the edge of the yard unsure what to do
next All three kids - Todd Alice and Todd’s buddy - have
stopped playing to stare at him

Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass He picks it up and
tosses it to Todd’s Buddy The Boy catches it throws it

back to Caesar

TODD‘S BUDDY
Check it He wants to play

Thrilled at the contact Caesar throws the ball to Todd But
Todd has an idea and the idea makes him smile

FEELS SORRY FOR HIM

THEN IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT’S
GOING ON HE’S THE BUTT OF A JOKE

They’re making fun of him
“MONKEY” “MONKEY” “MONKEY” The chanted words ring in
Caesar’s ears He drops his arms and walks over to Todd

stepping close hot rage escaping from his nostrils

Todd tries to laugh it off but the fear’s plain on his face
Alice runs inside

GROVE OF TREES

SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH GREEN LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM
A CANOPY OVERHEAD

WALTER
Go ahead Climb

The men sit down on a log watching as Caesar swings from the
branches Free elated An animal in his element

Caesar begins climbing a redwood Our view of him is
obscured by the leaves As his dark form ascends Will and
Walter become smaller and smaller down below

SUPER THREE YEARS LATER

RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward He moves with an easy
grace exhilarated by the freedom

At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE
LEAVES AND WE SEE THAT HE’S GROWN FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP
EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER

HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW EYES A DEEP
GREEN FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN PERHAPS MORE HUMAN

Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco looks north at
the mountains Then down to Will below

Will’s pointing to his watch

beside him on the forest floor

They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
DANE The dog BARKS lunging menacingly The Woman
struggles to control him

WOMAN
(incredulous)
Is that a chimpanzee

WILL
Don’t worry - he’s harmless Very
sweet
The big dog keeps BARKING

Annoyed Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE
CHIMPANZEE SNARL BARING HIS TEETH

The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
the Woman away

CHIMP a GRIZZLED OLD MALE STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS HE
LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL

Caesar’s transfixed

In a flash Caesar’s down the attic stairs

fists

HUNSIKER
Help Get him off -

over his shoulder - Caesar’s closing in

Breath coming hard Hunsiker sprints scrambles desperate to
escape He looks over his shoulderbut this time CAESAR
HAS DISAPPEARED HE’S NOT ANYWHERE UP OR DOWN THE STREET
Unsure where to go half-stumbling Hunsiker keeps running

Then OUT OF NOWHERE CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE HE
LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER BLOCKING HIS PATH

Hunsiker backs up changes direction runs across the street

Enjoying the chase taking his time Caesar grabs a tree
branch and swings from tree to tree

With one giant jump he makes it to the top of a tree across
the street tracking Hunsiker like prey

Hunsiker’s running out of steam Caesar swings down in front
of him and KICKS him in the chest sending him flying

Calmly he stands over Hunsiker who cowers

HUNSIKER
Please no

Caesar pounds his chest YELLING in triumph
But then he sees something across the street that abruptly

You’ve been gone a week

WILL
I was sick

Too sick to return my calls You
know it was a funny thing but I
was watching the news and they
started talking about a seven-year-
old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
all of a sudden there you were on
the TV A seven year old chimp
raised since birth

The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
voice Neither man cares

WILL
Hes the son of chimp 4 And he’s
smart Off-the-charts smart
Because of the 112 The genetic
therapy was passed in utero - from
the mother to the son Without a
single negative side-effect

JACOBS
Aside from biting off a man’s
finger
WILL
He was protecting my father The
same way his mother was protecting
him

JACOBS
We’ve had this conversation
already We knew the 112 was
making the apes smart -

Jacobs looks at his old friend wondering about his sanity

WILL
We’ve discovered a safe treatment
It’s the payday youve been waiting
for I’ll recreate the primate
version of 112 for you

But only under one condition

It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged

JACOBS
You’re giving me conditions I
could have you arrested for what
youve done

WILL
But you won’t - you need me to
build the drug Here’s what I
need I want you to get Caesar
back

JACOBS
(thrown )
How the hell can I do that

WILL
However they do things in your part
of the world Get attorneys into

Make it happen

INT CHIMPANZEE HOUSECAESAR’S CAGE - MORNING

Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar’s cage
He wakes shivering with cold Notices that the other cages
are empty that his cage door is open

Tentatively he makes his way into the common area

INT CHIMPANZEE HOUSECOMMON AREA - MORNING

Caesar looks around No chimps The hose lies on the wet
floor along with the detritus of feeding time

He can HEAR the APES in the distance

Caesar tries the GATEDOOR to the outside LOCKED He
pauses then makes his way toward the BRIDGE

EXT ATRIUMBRIDGE - MORNING

Caesar walks across the bridge To his left (connecting to
the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE
BRIDGE

THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty

And THE GORILLA HOUSE which houses only one lone gorilla
BUCK who stares out at Caesar Caesar registers THE FACT
THAT BUCK’S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES Then he moves on
toward the atrium

The APES are visible inside CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK
Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around

the atrium The groups don’t mix - chimps hang with chimps
orangutans with orangutans

They haven’t noticed him yet
EXT ATRIUM - DAY
Caesar enters heads for the tree One by one the apes take

notice They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED
LIKE A HUMAN

HES ONE OF THEM BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT GREEN
EYES FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES POSTURE
MORE UPRIGHT

Caesar looks around finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM
Should he continue to the tree Go back to the cage

He spots a BALL across the way Moves to it - the eyes
follow him He picks it up The eyes wait

Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp It receives the
ball gives Caesar nothing - no smile no connection - then
tosses it to Rocket

Eyes on Caesar Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
trash His look is insolent an unmistakable challenge

AFRAID CAESAR TURNS HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE ROCKET
SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM

Caesar tries to walk around Rocket blocks his path reaches
out and pulls at Caesar’s sleeve as if to examine the
material Caesar jerks his arm away

Rocket bares his teeth raises his arms

Caesar considers the options - should he run Before he can
make a move Rocket GRUNTS grabs his shirt at the chest
Caesar tries to push Rocket away but the larger chimp throws
Caesar to the ground pinning him

Caesar struggles to get away accidentally SLAPPING Rocket

across the face

OUTRAGED Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar’s chest and starts
POUNDING him Caesar tries to block the blows but they’re
coming hard and fast his head his stomach his chest

Apes SHRIEK jump up and down egging Rocket on

Caesar manages to break loose crawling away Rocket grabs
at his shirt drags Caesar closer

He opens his mouth wide moving sharp teeth toward Caesar’s
face Caesar struggles barely holds him off - and

ROCKET BITES HIS ARM BLOOD SPURTS

BAM A SHOT RINGS OUT Chimps scatter

Stunned Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR’S
BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE RIFLE IN HAND He
pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder

Caesar starts to move off -

BAM DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF
CAESAR’S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS

BAM DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN

Caesar rolls over to look up as Rocket topples onto him
Out cold

INT RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY
Caesar lies on a medical table NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED
His shirt’s ripped and he’s still wearing the khaki pants

now filthy and torn TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST
PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE

It’s a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment
Rocket’s across the way unconscious but breathing
restrained to a medical table

Caesar opens his eyes Takes a moment to get his bearings

A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him He’s tentative nervous

VIRUS TECHNICIAN
Dr Rodman - I think there’s been a
mistake

Will’s been waiting for this observation - he’s surprised it
took so long to come up

VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
Ive double-checked the replication
rate of the 113 and it’s
enormously fast compared to the

WILL
Thats why we’re using it We need
the drug quickly

VIRUS TECHNICIAN
But isn’t it risky I mean at
this rate of propagation we
greatly increase the possibility of
mutations that are out of our
control It’s a highly unstable -—

WILL
I appreciate your concern — but
it’s going to be fine We plan on
taking precautions

The Technician pauses not entirely satisfied But Will’s
look tells him the conversation is over

his mouth and moves drunkenly to the storage shed

He emerges with two BEERS throws one to Rodney

ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN

DODGE and RODNEY

Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages brandishing
ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS The primates rouse themselves move
across the bridge

On his way out an orangutan MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE
ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out
then moves off to join the others

Caesar maneuvers to get a better view

Rocket walks king-like among the apes Caesar watches him
push a smaller MALE aside The Male defers extending his
arm forward palm up supplicating ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS
HAND PALM DOWN OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE

Rocket’s the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE

Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA Buck - still
alone in his cage staring through the bars miserable

Why doesn’t the gorilla ever get to go out

Then something across the ranch catches Caesars eye WILL’S
CAR’S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE

His heart skips a beat He moves to the bars barely able to
contain his excitement

EXT RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
on a leash He’s immediately struck by Caesar’s injured
appearance but he plasters a smile on his face Caesar’s
clearly thrilled to see him

CAESAR

Caesar realizes Will’s going to leave him here

First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
starts walking back to his cage

WILL (CONT’D)
Wait a second - Caesar where are
you going

Caesar doesn’t respond doesn’t turn just keeps walking
Dedge catches up with him

ground Will stands over him too livid to realize he
might‘ve just broken his hand

WILL
You son of a bitch

Dodge scrabbles to his feet wipes the blood from his nose

DODGE
That was not a smart thing to do

Dodge is clearly much tougher stronger than Will but Wills
too angry to care

WILL
If I find out Caesar’s been hurt
if he’s mistreated in any way I
swear I’ll have you brought up on
charges

Dodge looks towards Landon’s house restrains himself
DODGE
That wild-eyed chimp isn’t yours
any more He’s mine now
The truth of the statement is worse than any punch
DODGE (CONT’D)

And you’re on private property
Now get the hell out of here

WILL
Forget jail I‘11 come back and

And some are born rotten

To quiet him Caesar walks over to Rocket’s cage but as he
gets closer he sees something that gives him pause ROCKET’S
EYES HAVE CHANGED

Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rockets cage takes
Rockets face in his hands and looks into his eyes THEY ARE
UNMISTAKABLY GREEN

Reeling Caesar tries to make sense of this And then he
remembers the bite Rocket bit him He looks down at the
wound on his arm now nearly healed

Has Caesar’s blood changed Rocket

anything

He stands there looking down at Will and Stewart

KOBA

HIS EYES ARE BEADY A STEELY GREY

THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP EACH SENSES

Koba offers up ANOTHER MandM But ROCKET’S EYES ARE ON THE RED
IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT’S WHAT HE WANTS

KOBA CAN SEE THIS HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING
HIS CAGE

ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH
ANGLE ON Caesar

He’s nearly reached the last of the cages and the
DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE

(seeing Cornelia’s open

cage)
You sly son of a bitch How’d you
do that

Dodge is careful slow as he picks up the shovel and holds
it in front of him

He circles around the common area toward Cornelia’s cage

DODGE (CONT’D)

The apes - chimps orangutans the gorilla - are silent
riveted waiting to see what will happen

Cornelia stands watching

Caesar doesn’t take his eyes off Dodge but his expression is
‘unreadable

Dodge reaches Cornelia’s cage He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL
AGAINST THE BARS

DODGE (CONT’D)
Back

Caesar reacts a snarl curling his lips

Keeping his eyes on Caesar sweat dripping down his temples
Dodge KICKS CORNELIA’S CAGE SHUT

Now he starts moving forward trying to back Caesar toward
the orangutan cage

DODGE (CONTD)
We’re going to have you fixed
Einstein that’s for damn sure
But first we’re going to figure out
how you pulled this off

CAESAR INCHES BACK KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE’S EYE ON HIM

DODGE (CONTD)
Go on Get in that cage

Caesar stops refusing to go any farther

DODGE (CONTD)
I said get

But Caesar doesn’t move

Dodge pokes the shovel at him then SLAMS it to the cement
floor

He edges closer to Caesar grip tightening around the shovel
handle Then he rears it back face contorted in rage

DODGE (CONTD)
Get in that cage you damn dirty

(with his voice)
No

STUNNED SILENCE

THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING

Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance
Caesar has spoken Actually uttered a word

Maurice Rocket Buck and all the apes stare dumbfounded
trying to comprehend what has just happened

And then they go nuts

SCREAMING YELLING JUMPING UP AND DOWN

That’s when Caesar attacks

He rushes Dodge wrestling the shovel from his hands

Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN T
THE SIDE OF THE HEAD

Dodge staggers back

Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach

Dodge crumples forward

CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD
Lights out

Caesar drags Dodge to Rockets cage and opens the door
Rocket helps pull him inside

THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE
APES COME STREAMING OUT

They gather around Caesar who holds up STEWART’S SCISSORS
AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM

Then he walks to Rocket who gets down on his knees and puts

out his hand in the supplicating gesture CAESAR TAKES THE

SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET’S PALM THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

HANDS TOGETHER ©

He moves to Maurice who offers up his hand Caesar slices
the palm and places his hand against it

Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall beats his chest
and YELLS BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND

And now Caesar looks around as EVERY APE LINES UP THEIR
OPEN PALMS WAITING

with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps

Then Caesar starts to climb Shimmying up a cable and into
the fog Rocket’s right behind

The remaining apes follow
INT HELICOPTER - DAY
From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army

Chimps ascend cables disappearing in and out of patches of
fog

Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck

And Buck with his gorilla take refuge in the stalled
traffic

BELOW THE BRIDGE

Maurice finds bars and support beams He and the below-deck
apes begin swinging their way toward the north end

ABOVE BRIDGE

Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog arriving at
the MAIN CABLE the thick one running along the top

They start scampering and swinging north the FOG MOVING AND
SWIRLING CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM

A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT

A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH It’s a long fall until - SPLASH
- the chimp hits the water

They keep moving
ON THE BRIDGE

The FOUR PATROL CARS stop creating a barricade The
Sharpshooters line up their rifles ready to shoot

DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR FINDS A RIFLE AND LOCKS AND
LOADS

They FIRE at the apes above them but it’s tough going - the
apes are in constant motion and the fog obscures them

BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables

Another chimp falls to its death

Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in engulfing the middle part
of the bridge surrounding the barricade Visibility’s

practically zero

NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM
IN THE FOG

OFFICER
They’re all around us

Apes swing above them scamper by them Movement - WHOOSH -
WHOOSH

DODGE - nervous crouches low He edges backwards hopeful
of some visibility

That’s when he SEES CAESAR CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG
CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE

WITH RELISH DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE AIMS AT CAESAR’S BACK
Theres glare from a ray of sunlight that’s broken through
the fog

He SHOOTS BARELY MISSING The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
cable

ROCKET climbing behind Caesar looks down - SEES DODGE
AIMING AGAIN He starts swinging towards Caesar

Another shot from Dodge This time the BULLET GRAZES
CAESAR’S SHOULDER AND CAESAR STUMBLES STARTS TO FALL

ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM HOLDING CAESAR
UP

Then using all his strength ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO
THE MAIN CABLE

BAM

Rocket‘s hit in the back

He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE
BRIDGE TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH

Caesar SCREAMS looks down at Dodge who aims again

But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON
THE BRIDGE

The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION LEAD BY BUCK THEY CHARGE TOWARD

THE BARRICADE
Like a freight train of menacing power

Helicopters FIRE MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
back up

A gorilla falls but they keep on coming

And now climbing up from below - behind the barricade -
MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in

Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable
BELOW THE BRIDGE

Koba hangs back He’s away from the action but the battle
waged above is audible

He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge
AERIAL VIEW

As the fog lifts for a moment WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
CABLES APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE AND
APES SCAMPERING BELOW

Vanquishing the humans

ON THE BRIDGE

THE GORILLAS RUN UP OVER THE BARRICADE CRUSHING GUNS AND
CARS

BUCK’S EYES ARE ON ONE THING

DODGE

Terrified but refusing to run Dodge fires reloads fires
again his face red with the tension of what’s to come

BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE’S BODY
PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE

Dodge’s body twirls through the air -
INT HELICOPTER - DAY

Will Stewart and Huffs watch dumbstruck as DODGE’S BODY
HITS THE WATER

Below the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit

-disappearing into the dense park
EXT MUIR WOODS PARKPARKING LOT - DUSK

POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive
HELICOPTERS above

Will’s helicopter has set down He and Stewart stand near an
ASSEMBLING ARMY - an amalgamation of ‘human special forces’

Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby

OFFICER 1 os
We can’t gas the forest The

slightest wind would take it over
to Tiburon

OFFICER 2
Well it‘’‘ll take us months to find
them in there

OFFICER 3
Not to mention rounding them all
up

Will approaches the group

WILL
I know where they are

The Officers look at him Who the hell is this guy
Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will

HUFFS
This man owns one of the chimps
(beat)
The so-called “leader” Says he
can reason him out

f WILL
His name is Caesar I think he’1l
listen to me If he comes out the
other apes will follow
Sounds pretty far-fetched
OFFICER 1
You think you know where to find
this monkey
Will starts to correct him - lets it go

WILL
I do I used to bring him here

The Officers look at each other
OFFICER 1
We don’t have a lot of options
Let’s give it a try
WILL
But you have to promise me - if I
can get them out you’ll take them
peacefully Tranquilize them cage
them No killing
Beat

HUFFS
Whatever it takes

EXT MUIR WOODSEDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods Theyre at
the path Caesar and Will used to take

She’s terrified trying to mask it

WILL
You think this is a bad idea

STEWART
Definitely

He thought so

STEWART (CONT’D)
He’s never going to agree to come

out with you
WILL
I know Got to try right I owe
him that much

Will kisses her Heads off down the path Then he pauses
turns to look at her

WILL (CONTD)
(yelling back)
Think he’ll forgive me
STEWART
(can’t quite hear him)
What

Will waves it off - never mind

Stewart watches him walk down the trail and disappear into
the woods

EXT DEEP WOODS - DUSK

Will walks FLASH OF BLACK up ahead His pulse quickens -
he follows it

CRACKLING of BRANCHES

More BLACK swinging through the trees Is it Caesar
Will follows

EXT PARKCLEARING - DUSK

Will enters the clearing

He knows this place Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
CANOPY that Caesar always loved

EXT MUIR WOODSPARKING LOT - DUSK

Huffs stands looking at his watch He looks up turns to an
ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN

HUFFS
Follow me

Stewart double-takes sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL’S
DIRECTION GUNS READY

STEWART
Hang on a second
(to nearest Officer)
Where are they going

Looks are exchanged Someone grabs Stewart who struggles
with all her might

STEWART (CONTD)
WHERE ARE THEY GOING

EXT PARKCLEARING - DUSK

Quiet here Will heads toward the Grove of Trees

He keeps walking almost there A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN
FRONT OF HIM

IT’S KOBA

Will takes a step back fear crawling up the back of his
neck

WILL (CONT’D)
You

Koba stands up tall Eyes Will

He takes his time - like he’s enjoying every second of
this He walks towards Will bares his teeth

Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS SLAMMING INTO KOBA knocking him
away

ENRAGED KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR BUT CAESAR JUST
STARES HIM DOWN

KOBA —- THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS
Which leaves just Will and Caesar

CAESAR
Humans coming

WILL
No I’m alone

Will pauses - there’s so much he wants to say

WILL (CONT’D)
I owe you an apology

CAESAR
Will want Caesar dead

WILL
I thought you had killed a man
But I should have known better

Caesar’s face is unreadable Will can’t tell what he’s
thinking

WILL (CONT’D)
I want you to know that all of this
is my fault My responsibility
(beat)
Can you forgive me

BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT Caesar’s eyes shift to the path
Will realizes he’s been betrayed
WILL (CONTD)

(panicked)
Wait - no -

CAESAR
Will leave

WILL
I wont -

CAESAR

Will leave now

WILL
No I’m staying with you

Caesar pushes him Will staggers backwards falls down
At that moment HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing
Huffs takes aim at Caesar

WILL (CONT‘D)
NO

HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER THE BLAST
OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST’S SILENCE

AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES - IT’S AN AMBUSH
- a COUNTERATTACK

Huffs and his men are taken by surprise SHOTS are fired
but not fast enough

UNLIKE ALPHA’S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA IT’S A SLAUGHTER IN THE
APES’ FAVOR

NEWSCASTER VOICE 1 (0S)
As the ape search continues a
virulent flu strain has exploded in
and around San Francisco sending
shock waves and panic throughout
the community

EXT CLEARING - DAY

We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
of trees As we get closer we notice flashes of movement

NEWSCASTER VOICE 2
Authorities suspect the origin of
the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
Laboratories - the same private
company from which several
laboratory chimpanzees escaped
earlier this week -

Were still fifty yards away from the trees but we can see
it’s filled with apes - chimpanzees orangutans gorillas

We keep pushing in closer and closer to the trees As we
move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK MAURICE AND SITTING
APART FROM THE OTHERS KOBA

All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN
NEWSCASTER VOICE 3
As the death toll rapidly rises
Hospitals are desperately trying to
meet the growing demand

Caesar sits alone staring straight at us

(increasingly desperate)
Although isolated in the western
region of the country the numbers
are catastrophic and quickly
rising

Push in on CAESAR‘’S FACE

have failed The strain has been
spotted as far away as Singapore
and Australia

CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR’S FACE

levels Authorities urge you to
stay inside your homes
