FADE IN (BEFORE TITLES)
EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK
Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite though

oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm

a few birds a distant rumble of thunder from some
clouds on the horizon a dogs barking

CAMERA PANS the green squared-off flatland lit only
fine sunset in its final throes Then gradually

from nothing a rumble is heard quickly growing louder
louder until the sound of a train can be recognized
CAMERA PANS quickly discovering the railroad line atop
man-made rise of land and the speeding passenger train
upon us flashing by with a roar

Then as if from nowhere the figure of a man hits the
embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into

thick underbrush alongside the tracks
CLOSE SHOT -- BODY

It lies in the bushes still unmoving -- dead CAMERA
PANS

AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of
the

train fades off until there is silence once more

TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash

FADE IN

EXT MEGEVE -- DAY

A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-
side

overlooking the French resort town A large open sun
deck --

tables gaily colored parasols sun bathers

One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT a lovely young
girl

She is besides taking in the sun involved in her
favorite

activity -- eating

Then -- a dark ominous shape intrudes in the fg
FOCUS

CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver --
shining

black and ugly in the sunlight

REGGIE unaware of her danger continues to eat

The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the
gun

shoots -- a stream of water arcs with unerring aim
straight

into REGGIEs face

You tell him you wanted the small

behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from
their chins to under the chins of the women -- without
their hands

(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing
partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange

the partners throat until he or she can grip it

enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person
in line where the process begins anew However the
miscalculation which can be brought about by any

human frailties -- haste modesty inhibition or lack
ordination -- will surely result in losing control of
orange so that it either falls to the floor where it
only be picked up by the chin or it starts to roll and
from its proper place to some other less proper spot

it -- again with the chin only This latter is an

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes The five men They were of
looks at

matches

the

course your husband Charles the
three men who showed up at his funeral
yesterday and Carson Dyle But
something went wrong and they were
unable to locate their contact It
must have been at that point that

they decided to steal the money

REGGIE
Steal it how

BARTHOLOMEW
By burying it and then reporting
that the Germans had captured it
All they had to do was come back
after the war dig it up and split
it five ways -- a quarter of a million
dollars with no questions asked

REGGIE
(fascinated)
May I have a cigarette please

BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one

it and rips off the filter tip He winces

REGGIE
I hate these things -- its like
drinking coffee through a veil

She puts the other end in her mouth then picks up the

and lights it

BARTHOLOMEW
Everything went smoothly enough until
after the gold was buried -- then

before they could get out they were
ambushed by a German patrol A machine
gun separated Scobie from his right
hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full

in the stomach

REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack rips off

(he winces again) and puts it into her mouth

BARTHOLOMEW
Whats wrong with that one
practically

first

He points to the cigarette she just lit still
brand-new in the ashtray

REGGIE
Oh Nothing I guess What happened
then

She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW who sadly
examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the

cigarette

BARTHOLOMEW
Have you any idea what these things
cost over here

REGGIE
Please go on Mr Bartholomew --
what happened then

BARTHOLOMEW
Scobie was able to travel but Carson
Dyle was clearly dying so they --

The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup

WAITER
La soupe cest pour qui

REGGIE
Pour moi Go on Mr Bartholomew

The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves

BARTHOLOMEW
Carson was dying so they were forced
to leave him They finally got back
to the base made their report and
waited for the war to end Only
harles couldnt wait quite as long
s the others He beat them back to
he gold took everything for himself
nd disappeared Its taken Gideon
ex and Scobie all this time to catch
p with him again

gGgHoectwa

REGGIE
But if they stole all that money --
why cant you arrest them

BARTHOLOMEW
We know what happened from the bits
and pieces we were able to paste
together -- but we still have no
proof

REGGIE
But what has all this got to do with
the C10

BARTHOLOMEW
C1IA Mrs Lampert Were an
extension of the wartime 0SS It
was our money and we want it back

REGGIE
Im sorry Mr Bartholomew but
nothing youve told me has changed
my mind I still intend leaving Paris --

to your husband when he tried to
leave Those men wont be very far
away -- no matter where you go In
fact I dont even see any point in
your changing hotels Please help

counting on you

Indian you ask him if hes a truthful
Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot He
tells you hes a truthful Whitefoot
but which one is he

my shower

DYLE
Then I suggest you call one of them

REGGIE
I dare you

DYLE looks at her then sits down and starts to remove
his
shoes

REGGIE

Have you ever heard of anyone taking
a shower with his shoes on
(to himself)
What a nut

Shoes off DYLE starts for the bathroom humming

DYLE
I usually sing a medley of old
favorites when I bathe -- any
requests

washing

himself without the suit

DYLE
The suit needs it more than I do
anyway

REGGIE

How often do you go through this
little ritual

As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it

DYLE
Every day The manufacturer recommends
it

REGGIE
I dont believe it

He opens his coat and reads a label inside
DYLE
Wearing this suit during washing

will help protect its shape

He flicks a little water in her face then takes the

nail-

brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band He holds up
his

wrist so she can see the watch

DYLE
Waterproof

He begins unbuttoning his suit She turns and leaves
slamming

the door after her

At a table for two by the rail the city slowly passing
in

DYLE
Reggie -- you havent spoken a word

in twenty minutes

REGGIE
I keep thinking about Charles and
Scobie -- and the one whos going to
be next -- me

DYLE
Nothings going to happen to you

believe that

REGGIE
How can I believe it when you dont
even know who the killer is Ive
got that right havent I You dont
know who did it

DYLE
No -- not yet

REGGIE
But then if we sit back and wait
the field should start narrowing
down shouldnt it Whoevers left
alive at the end will pretty well
have sewn up the nomination wouldnt
you say so

DYLE
Are you trying to say that I might
have killed Charles and Scobie

She doesnt answer

DYLE
What do I have to do to satisfy you --
become the next victim

REGGIE
Its a start anyway

DYLE
I dont understand you at all -- one
minute youre chasing me around the
shower room and the next youre
accusing me of murder

REGGIE
Carson Dyle didnt have a brother

WIDER ANGLE
She rises from the table and walks away DYLE hesitates
moment then follows

DYLE
I can explain if youll just listen
Will you listen

REGGIE
(looking at the river)
I cant very well leave without a
pair of water wings

DYLE
Okay Then get set for the story of

make the best-seller list

REGGIE
Fiction or non-fiction

DYLE
Why dont you shut up

REGGIE
Well

DYLE
Are you going to listen
REGGIE
Go on

DYLE
After I graduated college I was all
set to go into my father business
Umbrella frames -- thats what he
made It was a sensible business I
suppose but I didnt have the sense
to be interested in anything sensible

REGGIE
I suppose all this is leading
somewhere

DYLE
It led me away from umbrella frames
for one thing But that left me
without any honest means of support

REGGIE
What do you mean

DYLE
When a man has no profession except
the one he loathes whats left I
began looking for people with more
money than theyd ever need --
including some theyd barely miss

REGGIE
(astonished)
You mean youre a thief

DYLE
Well it isnt exactly the term Id
have chosen but I suppose it captures
the spirit of the thing

REGGIE
I dont believe it

DYLE
Well I cant really blame you --
not now

REGGIE
But I do believe it -- thats what I
dont believe So its goodbye
Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter

advantages youve got -- brains

ADAM
Oh come on

REGGIE

ADAM
Yes but --

ADAM AND REGGIE

food)
I think thats what you ordered

REGGIE
Dont you dare to be civil with me
All this time you were leading me on --

ADAM
How was I leading you on

REGGIE
All that marvelous rejection -- you
knew I couldnt resist it Now it
turns out you were only interested
in the money

ADAM
Thats right

REGGIE (HURT)
Oh

ADAM
What would you like me to say --
that a pretty girl with an outrageous
manner means more to an old pro like
me than a quarter of a million

BRITISH DELEGATE
Mr Chairman fellow delegates -- my
distinguished colleague from Italy
Her Majestys delegation has listened
with great patience to the Southern
European position on this problem
and while we find it charmingly
stated we cannot possibly agree
with its content In 1937 in the
British colonies of Kenya Uganda
and Tanganyika -- and if Im not
mistaken more or less in Somaliland --
a programme of crop rotation was
instituted vis-a-vis arable land
which had never before known the
plough beginning before the soil
was able to know the sort of fatigue
now plaguing most of Western Europe
In 1937 therefore Her Majestys
Government -- at that time His
Majestys Government -- was able to
properly assay the situation We
therefore oppose the resolution

INT REGGIES BOOTH -- DAY

day he was killed

ADAM

no law against stealing stolen money

REGGIE
