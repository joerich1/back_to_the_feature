EXT LA SCALA OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
TITLE CARD MILAN ITALY

A cool fog rolls across the city streets The famed opera
house glows in the haze like a cathedral

Large red posters of Bizet’s “Carmen” adorn the
building’s exterior

A group of JAPANESE SCHOOLGIRLS follow a TOUR GUIDE past
a CROWD of people and through the stone archways of the
entrance

INT LOBBY - LA SCALA - CONTINUOUS

The Japanese Schoolgirls soak in the rich decor of the
legendary theater as the Tour Guide drones on and on

TOUR GUIDE
Salieri’s Eurpoa Reconosciuta was the
first opera performed here on August 3

The Tour Guide never stops walking as she speaks She
leads the Schoolgirls through the lobby into the theater
proper

Two girls at the back of the line seem particularly
bored They are KEIKO a stunningly beautiful 18 year-old
and MIDORI her somewhat mousy best friend

INT THEATER - LA SCALA — CONTINUOUS

The theater is a sight to behold Tuxedoed PATRONS fill
luxurious boxes The seats are of red velvet encrusted
with gold A huge chandelier dominates the center of the
room

The SYMPHONY tunes as the Tour Guide leads the girls to
their seats
TOUR GUIDE
It was here that Rossini made his name
where Verdi premiered most of his works
and Puccinis Madame Butterfly made its
premiere

Keiko and Midori take the last seats by the aisle

KEIKO
Come on it’s our last night in Milan
Let’s get out of here and have some fun

MIDORI
We’1ll get in trouble

KEIKO
Fine you stay Enrich yourself But as
soon as the lights go down I’m out of
here Are you coming

The lights dim The music rises

Midori looks to the stage and then back to the
mischievous grin on Keiko’s face

The first slow strains of “Bolero” rise from the Symphony

EXT LA SCALA - NIGHT

Midori and Keiko dash away from the Opera House LAUGHING
gleefully as a heavy techno beat drops in over “Bolero”

The music carries over as we

INT SMALL BEDROOM —- NIGHT

CUT TO

A single bulb illuminates a small desk and little else A

MAN sits at the desk with his back to us
drawer and pulls out a small zippered black leather

case

His Hands have an odd yellow skin tone

He opens a

He unzips the case revealing a syringe and an ampoule of
clear liquid

The Man sticks the needle into the ampoule and draws

liquid into the syringe
He places the full syringe back into the case zippers it
shut and turns to the door without ever showing us his
face

The TECHNO BEAT intensifies as we

CUT TO

INT DISCO — NIGHT

Primary colors bathe the throng of CLUB-GOERS in a pop
art glow The music THROBS relentlessly

Keiko and Midori smile wide to each other and dash to the
bar

Keiko and Midori drink shot after shot in a PULSING
disco

The Girls dance sweaty and joyous
Midori makes out with an Italian STUD as Keiko smiles

Keiko and Midori knock down a couple more shots this
time surrounded by adoring young MEN - they all CHEER

Keiko dances wildly as Midori grinds against the Stud

INT BATHROOM - DISCO - NIGHT

The muffled music still THUMPS from the other room
Midori pulls Keiko aside

MIDORI

You were right this was a great idea
KEIKO

So what about the guy
MIDORI

It’s not like I’m ever going to see him

again

Midori blushes unable to contain a wonderfully guilty
smile

Keiko rolls her eyes

KEIKO
Fine I’1l just head back to the hotel
MIDORI
You aren’t mad at me

Keiko shakes her head “no” They hug

EXT DISCO - MOMENTS LATER

Keiko steps out of the club and waives for a cab She
shuffles nervously from foot to foot as she looks both
ways down the street

A group of loud drunken MEN stumble down the street
toward her

KEIKO
Come on

She is clearly a bit frightened of the approaching Men
and avoids eye contact as

A cab pulls up

KEIKO (CONT’D)
Oh thank you thank you

She opens the door before the vehicle can come to a
complete stop

INT TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

Keiko plops down in the backseat and SIGHS with relief
She leans forward to the CAB DRIVER

KEIKO
Hotel Sanpi Milano

IN THE FRONT SEAT - the Driver drums his yellow fingers
on a small black zippered case

It’s the Man from the earlier scene - from here on we
will call him YELLOW

He says nothing

KEIKO (CONT’D)
Hotel Sanpi Milano
(broken Italian)
Per favore

Yellow nods and throws the cab into gear pulling away
from the curb
EXT CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The cab cruises down a busy Milanese boulevard

We follow the cab as it turns down progressively quieter
and narrower streets until it pulls into a dark dead-end
alley

The engine shuts off

The car shakes

A muffled SCREAM erupts from inside the cab

The car shakes again

Barely illuminated by a distant street light we see

Keiko’s terrified SCREAMING face in the cab’s rear
window

She POUNDS on the glass

A hand wraps tight around her mouth and yanks her back
into the darkness of the cab

CUT TO

INT DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT

Keiko awakens on a tile floor A Bright surgical lamp
casts harsh shadows -- it takes a moment for her eyes to
adjust

KEIKO
Ugh

Her hands and feet are bound with coarse hemp ropes

She grimaces as she fights against her restraints to no
avail

KEIKO (CONT’D)
Herupuhelp

Her eyes come into focus to realize there’s someone else
in the room

Shes face to face with a wall-length mirror

She turns to see
Yellow standing by a large table silhouetted by the
lamp

YELLOW

You’re awake
(to something on the table)
You see that We have company
A gurgling GROAN comes from the table

YELLOW (CONT’D)
Of course how rude of me Say hello to
your new friend

Keiko’s eye’s go wide with terror

KEIKO
Iie iie

Yellow adjusts a lever on the table and tilts it forward
to reveal

A YOUNG WOMAN bound to the table - ropes around her arms
and legs -- tape holding her head perfectly still

Her eyelids and lips have been sliced off

Keiko SCREAMS and SCREAMS as Yellow pulls a camera and
flashes photographs of her

traffic on a Vespa

The traffic lights may as well not exist

The Vespa cuts in between cars making a hard right turn
from the far left lane

The scooter pulls up to a large old building

The sign out front reads “Polizia”

The delivery boy unstraps a large cardboard box filled
with small white bags and dashes into the police station
INT POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

The station house is large loud and teeming with
activity The Delivery Boy strides through people to the

the end of the corridor

We follow Linda as she dashes down the staircase the
Delivery Boy always seems to be just out of sight

LINDA
Wait Slow down

They descend two flights of stairs with each step the
light dims slightly the walls become more dingy and
worn

The stairs end at a sub-basement The Delivery Boy walks
quickly to the end of the dimly lit hall

He reaches the door and takes a breath before KNOCKING
The name on the door reads “Inspector Lavia”

The Delivery Boy lowers his head staring at his feet

ENZO (0S)

DELIVERY BOY
(over his shoulder)
Don’t look at the walls

The Delivery Boy opens the door to

INT ENZO’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The room is too brightly lit

Three walls are covered with gruesome crime scene
photographs The far wall is a Map dotted with colored

pins

DELIVERY BOY
Delivery

The Delivery Boy drops the bag on the cluttered desk and
quickly spins racing out of the room

Linda scans the walls and catches her breath
Standing with his back to her staring at the map is
INSPECTOR ENZO LAVIA his hair nails suit tie

everything about him is neat ordered and organized

Linda stands petrified unable to tear herself away from
the brutality of the crime scene photos

Enzo turns and grabs his panini sandwich from the bag and
takes a bite

He looks up to Linda who stares transfixed at the
photographs

ENZO
Why

LINDA
Why what

ENZO

Why are you still here Are you new

LINDA

(nodding to the photos)
Who are all these people What happened

to a delivery girl

ENZO

Annoyed Enzo steps around his desk and begins escorting
Linda out the office door

ENZO
Then you need to talk to the desk
sergeant he will

LINDA
(frustrated)
He’s the one who sent me down here

She pulls from his grip and stares him down

LINDA (CONT’D)
This isn’t a joke and I’m not a nutcase
Something happened to my sister and I
need your help

Enzo’s expression softens but it is obvious that he
isn’t comfortable making eye contact

ENZO
All rightIt’s okay Come on have a
seat

Enzo walks back around his desk plops down in his seat
and takes a bite of his sandwich

Linda stands frozen unable to relax

ENZO (CONTD)

Linda sits across from Enzo recounting her last
conversation with Celine She slides a photograph of her
sister across the desk to the Inspector

LINDA
-and she was supposed to meet me at her
apartment That’s the last I’ve heard
from her

ENZO
(examining the photo)
Shes very beautiful

LINDA
(nodding to the photos on the
wall)
Is that why I’m down here talking to
you

As they speak we move in on the crime scene photographs
that line the walls

ENZO
There’s no reason to believe your sister
is involved with this

LINDA
What is this Who are all these girls

ENZO
I’m afraid I cannot comment on an ongoing
investigation

Pictures of beautiful young women are paired up with
grisly crime scene photographs in a “before and after”
effect

The women have been mutilated their faces slashed and
disfigured Linda stares at the photos transfixed

LINDA
Who did this

ENZO
So this last phone call what time was
that

Linda snaps her attention back to her sister

LINDA
About seven thirty last night

ENZO
Was she into drugs Anything illegal

LINDA
Noshe used to have a problem but that
was a long time ago She’s been clean for
over a year

ENZO
Boyfriend Lover

Linda can’t control herself she looks back to the wall
of victims focusing on one photo in particular

The victim’s eyelids have been sliced off

LINDA
No

She eyes another photograph - a beautiful young Japanese
girl

A note beneath the photo reads “Keiko Watanabe Missing
four days Next victim”

ENZO
Does she have a history of this sort of
thing Running off without telling
anyone

Linda’s face goes white

ENZO (CONTD)
Miss Clark

LINDA
(snapping from her reverie)
UmI’ve told you she was on her way to
see me She was even pissed off that the
cab driver took a wrong turn
A look of realization washes over Enzo’s face

ENZO
(to himself)
A wrong turn

He hops out of his seat and moves to the map behind his
desk examining the location of several pins

LINDA
What What is it

Enzo is lost in thought

LINDA (CONT’D)
Inspector Lavia

Enzo snaps from his reverie and turns to Linda He’s
suddenly all business

ENZO
Thank you Miss Clark

He absently scoops a file up off his desk and tucks it
under his arm

LINDA
That’s it
ENZO
Is there anything else you haven’t told
me
LINDA
No but
ENZO

Then thank you that will be all
He escorts her to the door

LINDA
But Celine

ENZO
Miss Clark go home get some sleep let
me do my job

LINDA
You expect me to just wait

ENZO
Yespreferably by the phone

He guides Linda into the hallway and closes the door on
her

IN THE HALLWAY - Linda stands staring unbelievingly at
the door that was just closed in her face

A deep sorrow wells up in her eyes She forces the
emotion back down turns swiftly and kicks the wall in
frustration
IN THE OFFICE - Enzo focuses on the photograph of Celine
He glances up at the wall of victims
ENZO (CONTD)
You’re too beautiful He hates beautiful

things

INT DARKENED ROOM —- DAY

The door CREAKS open and a shaft of light falls across
Celine’s face

Cats race out through the open door
Celine looks up terrified to see
The silhouette of a Yellow in the doorway

He steps into the room carrying a large roll of plastic
sheeting and a bottle of bleach

Celine squirms against her restraints to no avail
CELINE
What is this What are you doing Let me
go

Yellow strides past her and over to the table

From her vantage point Celine can’t quite see what’s
going on

CELINE (CONT’D)
Please let me go

Yellow sets the bleach and plastic sheeting on the floor
and positions a large surgical lamp over the person
strapped to the table

The lamp FLICKERS to life casting an intensely focused
light on the table but leaving the rest of the room in
shadow

CELINE (CONT’D)
PleaseI didn’t do anything to youI
won’t tell anyoneI swear Just let me
go

Yellow ignores Celine he’s far more interested in the
job at hand

He leans over the person on the table his mouth and chin
illuminated by the lamp

YELLOW
Getting a little dry

He pulls some eye-drops from his pocket and drops them
into a face we still can’t see

YELLOW (CONT’D)
That’s better Can you still see Look at

sound of mortal terror

A sinister smile creeps over his thin yellow lips
YELLOW
Our new guest is growing impatient Let’s

He tilts the table forward violently
It’s Keiko

Her eyelids and lips have been sliced off

Her face is a mass of slashes and abrasions
Celine SCREAMS
YELLOW (CONT’D)
(to Keiko)

Look at yourself See how ugly you are

With no eyelids she cannot help but look at her hideous
reflection in the mirrored wall

Keiko’s tongue rolls about in her mouth as she struggles
to speak

KEIKO

Yellow turns his attention back to the Keiko

YELLOW

I’m afraid our time is over
KEIKO

Yellow pulls a box-cutter from his pocket and CLICKS the
blade out from its protective metal handle

CELINE

Yellow slashes wildly with the box-cutter

Blood spills across the floor splattering Celine in the
face

The Keiko SCREAMS and flails against the restraints
Celine SCREAMS

He turns and peers out the window and sees

The cab doubling back and slowly cruising past the
bookstore

ENZO
Following me huh Good

An instrumental version of “Stormy Weather” plays from an
old transistor radio behind the counter

The song sends Enzo’s mind reeling

FLASH - COCKTAIL PARTY - SOPHIA a stunning and curvy
woman in a white Halston dress leans against a piano
SINGING “Stormy Weather” - the drunken CROWD sways to the
music

FLASH - Sophia falls to the floor THUD - She wraps her
hands around her neck as blood gushes between her
fingersher throat has been slashed

FLASH - A MAN IN BLACK lords over Sophia with a bloody
butcher’s knife He looks up - his black hat casting a

Out of the corner of his eye he sees a cab pulling away
from the curb

He smiles and hops in his car

leaps from the car as the Cab turns into the alley

Enzo races toward the cab on foot gun drawn
The cab SCREECHES to a halt

Enzo yanks the CABBIE from the taxi and tosses him to the
street

He lords over the Cabbie gun pointed at his head
ENZO
Why Why are you following me huh Are

CABBIE

Enzo cocks the gun

ENZO
Why are you following me

Linda races from the back seat of the cab

LINDA

Enzo snaps his head in her direction confusion washing
over his face

ENZO
You What are you doing here

He carefully lowers the hammer on his gun and strides
over to Linda

LINDA

You realize you’re interfering with an
official police investigation

A tear leaks from the corner of Linda’s eye She wipes it
away angrily

Enzo takes a step back

LINDA (CONT’D)
Please Tell me I need to know

ENZO
Come with me

EXT GOVERNMENT BUILDING - LATER

Enzo’s car pulls up directly in front of a large plain
building He hops out of the car carrying his shopping
bag full of books

Linda follows him as he strides quickly into the
building

INT GOVERNMENT BUILDING -— CONTINUOUS

Linda’s heels CLACK on the tile floors as she follows
Enzo down a winding corridor

LINDA
What are we doing here How is all of
this helping my sister

ENZO

I’m gathering information
LINDA

By shopping
ENZO

This is Italy sometimes you need to
grease the wheels of bureaucracy You
said you moved around a lot where are

Studies Celine and I grew up in castle
ruins and cathedrals from the tip of
Spain to the Black Forest

ENZO
Where’s your home now

LINDA
Schenectady New York Why

ENZO
Say you’re from Texas

He leads her to a door that reads “Motor Vehicle
Registration Office (MVRO)” in Italian

He opens the door into an enormous office filled with
tiny partitioned cubicles

INT MVRO — CONTINUOUS

The place is a mess - imagine the DMV on the worst day
and throw a foreign language into the mix

Enzo makes a bee-line past the throng of angry impatient
LOCALS leading Linda deep into the maze of cubicles

LINDA
The DMV

ENZO
Where was she when you last spoke

LINDA
Coming off a runway show

ENZO
And how was she getting there

LINDA
She was in a cab

ENZO
Exactly

They stop and step into a cubicle adorned with bright
yellow movie posters for “DJANGO” and “ONCE UPON A TIME
IN THE WEST” and “TRINITY RIDES AGAIN”

Sitting staring at his computer screen is SAL a short
squat and pale bureaucrat obsessed with everything
“western”

He doesn’t even notice Enzo until the Inspector drops the
brown paper sack in Sal’s lap

SAL
What’s this

He rifles through the sack pulling out a half dozen
western paperbacks

SAL (CONTD)

read all of these

ENZO
Good to see you too Sal

SAL

little too vigorously

SAL

LINDA
Born and raised

SAL

a real live Texan

ENZO
Yes that’s all very nice Now do you

at least 30 pages long

ENZO

Enzo leads Linda out of the building They stride down
the stairs Enzo stops looking out over a sea of cabs

LINDA
All right I’ve played along Now it’s
your turn

ENZO
(matter of fact)
I believe your sister may have been
abducted by a pattern killer

LINDA
No

Linda chokes down the tears They won’t do her any good

LINDA (CONT’D)
She isn’t dead

ENZO
I never said she was not yet at least

It’s obvious that his interpersonal skills need some
work

Unable to process the information Linda plops onto the
granite steps

LINDA
What are we going to do

Enzo looks around nervously - pedestrians are staring and
it’s making him uncomfortable

ENZO
Come walk with me

LINDA
(confusion turning into rage)
What are we going to do

People on the street stop and stare at the outburst Enzo
blushes he can’t stand the attention He spies a public
park across the street

ENZO
Please just come with me and I’1l
explain everything

Linda looks up to him

ENZO (CONTD)
I promise

He extends a hand to her

LINDA

He nods She takes his hand

CUT TO

EXT PARK — CONTINUOUS

Enzo offers Linda a zeppoli (an Italian doughnut) from a
street vendor She waives it off

ENZO
As far as I can tell there have been
four maybe five victims already But his
pattern is just emerging At first they
were just a string of unsolved and
seemingly unrelated murders That’s why I
got them That’s what I do

LINDA
What do you do

ENZO
I get the cases no one else wants

LINDA
Why

ENZO
(ignoring her question)
The first victim was

Linda places her hand on his shoulder

LINDA
You said you’d tell me everything Now

He fidgets nervously

ENZO

Linda’s gaze penetrates Enzo’s nervous exterior

ENZO (CONTD)

FLASHBACK —- EXT CITY STREET —- NIGHT

A beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN wearing a backpack
strides down the sidewalk She’s alone and half the
street lights are out

ENZO (VO)
Foreigners all of them The first one
was a Russian art student

A Taxi pulls up behind her It’s lights are off The cab
follows her slowly keeping a safe distance pacing her

Hearing something Russian Woman turns
The headlights FLASH on silhouetting the woman
She shields her eyes against the high-beams

FLASHBACK —- INT DARKENED ROOM —- NIGHT

The Russian Woman lies tied to the table Yellow leans
over what was once her beautiful young face

ENZO (VO)
-He beat her to death with his fists

But now her face is halfway caved-in Blood flows from
her broken nose and jaw

RUSSIAN WOMAN
(gurgling through blood)
Nyet Nyet

ENZO (VO)

Yellow smiles and rears back fist cocked

RUSSIAN WOMAN

CRACK

He delivers a crushing blow to the increasingly pulpy
mass that is her face

ENZO
-he kept her aroundmade it linger

through bubbles of blood and bone

EXT PARK — EARLY EVENING

Linda sits stunned on a park bench while Enzo paces
about her
ENZO
Are you sure you want to hear more

LINDA
Yes I need to know

Enzo studies Linda’s face

ENZO
Your sister disappeared at seven thirty

You haven’t slept in the past twenty-four

hours have you

LINDA
Would you We have to find her

ENZO
Which is something I can do much better
without you tagging along

LINDA
Well get used to it Either bring me
along or throw my ass in jail because
I’m going to follow you no matter what
Every step of the way And you know how
dangerous I could be on these roads
trying to follow a cop You’d be
responsible for all the damages Hell
Id probably have to hop a cab and then
Id find her real quick

The reality of her last phrase kicks in a second too

late

LINDA (CONT’D)
I won’t slow you down

ENZO
It’s too dangerous

LINDA
This is my sistermy family

INT BATHROOM - YELLOW’S APARTMENT —- DAY

CUT TO

Yellow rinses his hands under the tap Bloody water
swirls in the drain

He reaches down beneath the sink and grabs

A bottle of bleach

He pours bleach over his hands and scrubs them
obsessively

He lifts his bleach-soaked hands up to his face takes a
deep whiff and smiles

INT YELLOW’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Yellow sets several pill bottles on a table beside a
laptop computer

He plugs the digital camera into the laptop

Photographs of Keiko’s mangled face pop up on the screen
as Yellow downs the pills dry

YELLOW
(smirking)
You are so ugly

He pops another pill and chokes it down without water

CUT TO

INT ENZO’S FIAT - LATER

Enzo speeds through the Milanese traffic Linda holds an
open file folder in her hands Her face registers the
horror of the images she has been studying

Gruesome crime scene photographs of the victims are
bundled with biographical information and “before” photos
of the young women

Linda shivers but shakes off her aversion to the images
and continues to flip through the pages

LINDA
They were all so beautiful

ENZO
Yes

LINDA
And he made them ugly

ENZO
What does that tell you about him
She stares at the photos flipping back and forth

Her mind reels

Beat

ENZO (CONTD)
Well

LINDA
He wants to destroy beautiful things

ENZO
And why would he want to do that

LINDA
Becausebecause he sees them as a
threat

ENZO
No but close Stop think Why would a
young man do this

LINDA
Jesus I don’t knowbecause he’s a
fucking monster

ENZO
Youre right about that But this one is
a specific kind of monster He’s careful
and thorough He chooses victims that
won’t be missed at least not by anyone
local Less heat less pressure That’s
why the press hasn’t gotten involved He
drops their bodies at seemingly random
locations an abandoned roller-rink a
brothel a scenic overlook But pattern
killers want attention they thrive on
it The locations can’t be random they
have to mean something

LINDA
But that doesn’t tell me why he does it

ENZO
Look at the last two victims

She flips through the file folder and stops on a close-up
shot of a young BLONDE WOMAN

Her eyelids have been sliced off

LINDA
It’s terrible

ENZO
He wanted her to see something Or us to
see something

LINDA
He wants them to see

A wave of realization washes over her
LINDA (CONT’D)
-to see how ugly they’ve become He
wants to make them uglier than he is
Enzo hits the brakes and jerks the car to the curb
ENZO
(stunned)
He makes them watch

He looks to Linda

ENZO (CONTD)
He makes them watch

Enzo hops out of the car

EXT NARROW STREET -— CONTINUOUS

Enzo lights a cigarette and paces along the sidewalk
lost in thought

Linda steps out of the car

LINDA
What What is it

He holds up a finger indicating “wait a minute”
He suddenly stops pacing and turns to Linda

ENZO
He’s a predator for sure but I thought
he was a hunter Until you came along and
mentioned the taxi Now I see he isn’t a
hunter he’s a trapper His victims
aren’t selected they simply fall into
his lap

LINDA
Like Celine
(beat)
So where does he take them

ENZO
Where does he keep them

CUT TO

Yellow pushes Keiko’s body off the table
THUD

She lands on the floor and rolls face-to-face with

The floor underneath Keiko is covered in plastic
sheeting

Yellow strides over to the body and begins rolling it in
the plastic

CELINE (CONT’D)
You won’t get away with this People are
looking for me You ugly piece of shit
Yellow secures the plastic sheeting with packing tape
He looks to Celine as she continues her tirade
CELINE (CONT’D)
That’s right You’re disgusting You know
that
RRRRRRRRIP

He tears a length of tape and moves over to Celine

CELINE (CONT’D)
What are you doing No get away from me

She squirms on the floor fighting against her restraints
as

Yellow wraps the tape securely around her mouth

Enzo pours over the voluminous list they got from Sal

He highlights a namethere are a half dozen highlighted
names on the page

Linda paces her pallid complexion shows her lack of
sleep

Half empty Chinese take-out boxes are strewn about

LINDA
How can you stand this

ENZO
This is police work Trust me I’ve dealt
with this type before The devil is in
the details That’s how we’ll catch him

LINDA
And save my sister

ENZO
Yesand save your sister

Enzo turns his attention back to the list

Linda plops down on the sofa defeated Her eyes
instantly grow heavy

LINDA
Why are you down herein the basement

ENZO
I’m not very good with people

LINDA
That’s why you don’t have a partner

ENZO

(chuckling)
It’s better for everyone if I work alone
My methods aren’t exactly by the book

Her eyes flutter closed

LINDA
(yawning)
It doesn’t bother you Being all alone
down here

ENZO
Ive been alone for a long time now Long
enough that company feelsodd I’ve
almost forgotten what it’s like to spend
this much time with someone
(we see a chink in his armor)
It’s nice

He looks up to Linda she’s dead asleep

A bittersweet smile crosses his face as he rises and
steps over to the sofa

Enzo pulls a blanket off the back of the sofa and drapes
it over Linda’s sleeping form

ENZO (CONTD)
It’s very nice

He smiles at her for a moment and steps silently back
over to his desk

He slides the bottom drawer open and pulls out an object
wrapped in an oiled rag

He rolls the rag open on his desk to reveal
A butcher’s knife

The song ends and the Guests applaud loudly as a young
BOY works his way through the Crowd with a tray of
canapes

Party-goers as Enzo shuffles up the stairs

INT ENZO’S BEDROOM - LATER

Enzo lies in bed staring at the ceiling The muffled
VOICES of exiting Guests rises from outside his window

The boy hops out of bed and peers down to the street
watching Guests climb into cars and drive off

Something across the street catches Enzo’s eye - A MAN IN
BLACK (long coat hat and gloves) stands in the shadows

The Man in Black looks up to Enzo’s window The boy
recoils instinctively

Gathering his nerve Enzo peers back out the window - The
Man is gone

The door swings wide to reveal
The Man In Black

Sophia’s eyes go wide as the Man raises a gleaming
butcher’s knife high overhead

SLICE

The blade catches Sophia’s left arm as she backs away
SCREAMING

She turns to run but the Man reaches out and grabs
Sophia by her long brown hair

He YANKS the hair and Sophia’s feet come out from under
her

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
NO NO NO NO

The Man In Black gives the blade a deft twirl in his
fingers before drawing it across the creamy flesh of
Sophia’s throat

Blood soaks her white Halston dress as she falls to the
floor THUD

Sophia wraps her hands around her neck as blood gushes
between her fingers

The Man In Black lords over Sophia with a bloody
butcher’s knife

With her dying breath Sophia glances up to the stairway

SOPHIA (CONT’D)

She reaches out

The Man in Black looks up - his black hat casting a
shadow over his eyesall we see is a crooked smile

He locks eyes with Young Enzo who cowers terrified
behind the bannister

he’s gone

Unable to move Young Enzo grips the bannister tight as

squad cars

Linda hops out of the car and races onto the scene
disappearing through the fog

A woman’s body propped up against a fountain wrapped
plastic sheeting

Linda charges to the body and begins pulling at the
sheeting trying to reveal the victim’s face

Officers shout as they descend on Linda

The cops try to pull Linda away but she continues to
claw at the plastic sheeting

Linda recoils in a combination of terror and relief

She collapses to her hands and knees beside the body and
looks up to Enzo

Enzo dashes past the patrol cars and to his little
Fiat

He reaches in the window and pounds the glove box with
his fist The box pops open and he grabs a micro-casette
recorder

He dashes back to the body and thrusts the recorder under
Keiko’s chin as her convulsions wane

Her voice trails off

past but placing himself in the dominant
role

for)
Ah here we are

Enzo steps up to a busy fish stand Crates of fresh
seafood move into the space at a lightning pace

Presiding over it all is TOSHI a middle-aged Japanese
fish monger

Toshi locks eyes with Enzo and freezes

TOSHI
I’m clean

ENZO
Of course you are
TOSHI
(glancing at Linda)
You got a partner now She’s cute

Linda glances at Toshi’s exposed and heavily tattooed
forearms Feeling her gaze Toshi rolls his sleeves down

TOSHI
Yeah sure

Enzo pulls out a tape recorder

ENZO
Can you tell me what she’s saying

He clicks “play” Keiko’s VOICE comes over the speaker

Toshi strains to listen
Enzo clicks the tape recorder “off”

TOSHI
I’m not sure

ENZO
Is it Japanese

TOSHI
Yeah it’s justit’s really hard to
understand her

Toshi grabs the recorder rewinds it a bit holds
close to his ear and clicks “play” Keiko’s voice

heard again

Toshi’s brow furrows as he concentrates on the voice

TOSHI (CONTD)
(translating)

“This body is not me I am not caught in

Toshi rolls his eyes
TOSHI
We don’t refer to ourselves that way The
word she’s using is “koushoku” the word
for the color yellow

The tape continues to play

Keiko’s voice turns to the guttural GROANS of her dying
breath

TOSHI (CONTD)
When did she die

Enzo grabs the recorder and clicks “Stop”

ENZO
Thank you

Enzo turns to walk away Linda follows closely
TOSHI

Same cheap drug-store brand make-up Same

strayed from her sister

LINDA

ENZO
He cleaned me up got me out of there He
looked after mewhen the time came he

understood me in a way no one else has I
owe all that I am to him

LINDA
How many times have you done it

Enzo looks to the building

ENZO

LINDA
How many have you killed

ENZO
Not as many as I could have

Linda steps back involuntarily suddenly frightened by
Enzo’s tone

ENZO (CONTD)
I do what has to be done and if that
means sometimes I have to killa
murdering son-of-a-bitch then that’s
what I do
(beat)
But I’m not like them

She takes his hand tenderly Enzo looks to her pleading
eyes

Beat

ENZO
I can’t

Enzo turns and walks away Linda watches as he disappears
down the stairwell

She turns into the apartment and closes the door

INT CELINE’S APARTMENT -— CONTINUOUS

Linda leans her head against the door defeated
exhausted and alone

She closes her eyes and heaves a heavy SIGH

Images FLASH through her mind

- Celine’s slashed face

- Celine’s mangled hand

She shivers and tries the shake the filth from her mind

CUT TO

A Yellow eye

Enzo strolls smoking a cigarette lost in thought

His phone rings

ENZO

Laviawhat’s that

CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR
(over the phone)
I said it’s a wolf’s head The image you
wanted me to enhance It’s a wolf’s head
on a ceramic tile wall

ENZO
Can you track it down If it was a
special order some sort of custom job

CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR
(over the phone)
We’re already sourcing it but we won’t
be able to confirm until morning

ENZO
Of course

He snaps the phone shut and rubs his brow

ENZO (CONTD)
Wolf’s headwolf’s head

Loud CHEERING erupts from a bar down the street
Enzo turns to see a dozen drunken AC Milan football fans
pour out of the bar into the street SINGING a rowdy
soccer song

(eyes lighting up)
The Wolves

INT BATHROOM - CELINE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Linda turns the water off and reaches out through the
shower curtain for a towel

She steps into the steamy room wiping her body dry

She wraps the towel around her wet hair and grabs a robe
from a hook on the back of the door

Her eyes go wide
94

A digital camera rests on the edge of the sink - an image
glowing on the display screen

Linda reaches out slowly nervously and grabs the
camera The image on the display screen sends a wave of
terror through her body

It’s Celine bound and bloody

YELLOW (0S)
She’s alive

Linda looks up to see
Yellow standing in the bathroom doorway
Linda reaches for a nail file

YELLOW (CONT’D)
Kill me and you’1l never find her

LINDA
Youre a liar

YELLOW
Look at the time-stamp That photo was
taken an hour ago

dead

Linda holds the nail file threateningly

LINDA
Where is she

YELLOW

Make one false move and she will die all
alone in the dark
The terror on Linda’s face turns to stoicism

He snaps the phone shut and dashes around the corner
Celine’s apartment building comes into view

CUT TO

INT CELINE’S APARTMENT -— CONTINUOUS

Linda dresses hurriedly as Yellow fiddles with something
in the vanity mirror

YELLOW
Usually when they’re begging for their
life it’s pathetic Offering sex or
trying to play on my better judgement
but your sister she actually came up
with a plan And if it works the both of
you might just make it out of this alive

Linda buttons her coat and turns to Yellow
Shes in her Flight Attendant uniform
LINDA
I can’t guarantee I can get you past
security They’re looking for you
everywhere You’ll be spotted Your
skin

Yellow turns away from the mirror to reveal

His face is covered in thick poorly applied skin-colored
foundation

He smiles wide the effect is skin-crawling

YELLOW
There Incognito

He pulls on a pair of black gloves and dons a wide-
brimmed black hat and sunglasses

Note - He’s wearing the classic Giallo slasher costume

YELLOW (CONT’D)
There is a flight to Zurich leaving in
forty minutes Get me on it I’1ll call
you with her location when I land
He checks his look in the mirror one last time

YELLOW (CONT’D)
You believe me

LINDA
Do I have a choice

YELLOW
Very good Keep in mind that your poor
Celine has lost a lot of blood She’1ll be
dead by dawn if you fail

Yellow grabs Linda by the arm and drags her to the front
door

He reaches for the doorknob as
BAM BAM BAM

Yellow clamps his hand over Linda’s mouth

peephole

IN THE PEEPHOLE - Enzo steps down the hall to the
stairwell He pauses and looks back to the door before
stepping down the stairs out of sight
LINDA

Yellow gives her a shove
YELLOW

INT STAIRWELL - CELINE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
Enzo leans against the wall and draws his gun
He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath
Suddenly he explodes into action dashing up the stairs

and plowing down the hallway toward Celine’s apartment
door

INT CELINE’S APARTMENT -— CONTINUOUS
WHAM

Enzo kicks the door open and charges into the room gun
at the ready

ENZO
Linda

No one’s there
Curtains billow around an open window

ENZO (CONTD)
Shit

He races to the window and peers out - there’s a fire
escape

EXT FIRE ESCAPE -— CONTINUOUS

Enzo climbs out the window and races up the stairs to the
roof

EXT ROOFTOPS - MILAN - NIGHT

Yellow leads Linda across the rooftoops PANTING Without
his meds the disease has begun to sap his strength

He sweats profusely His make-up runs
He suddenly slows

YELLOW
(out of breath)
Wait

LINDA
Where are we going

YELLOW
Just over there

He points to a ladder by the arched glass rooftop of the
Galleria Vittorio Emanuele - A stunning and world-famous
three-story mall that is home to the most fashionable
shops in Italy

YELLOW (CONT’D)
I have a car parked and waiting over
there

LINDA
Then come on

YELLOW
(still panting)
I need a second

She looks back to see Enzo climbing to the rooftop

LINDA
No time Come on

Linda pulls Yellow to his feet and forces him to keep
moving

Enzo dashes after them

LINDA (CONT’D)
Move

She supports most of Yellow’s weight as they inch closer
and closer to the ladder by the arched glass roof

Enzo closes on them fast

ENZO
Stop

Linda whips around as Enzo cocks and trains the gun on
Yellow

Yellow collapses to the gravel rooftop

Linda lunges at the gun as Enzo pulls the trigger
BAM

The bullet ricochets off the roof just missing Yellow

ENZO (CONTD)
What are you doing

Linda steps between Enzo and Yellow who continues to
crawl across the rooftop

LINDA
You can’t kill him We’ll never find her
if you kill him
ENZO
We know where she is

Enzo shoves past Linda and lords over Yellow
ENZO (CONTD)
(to Yellow)
The old stadium That’s where you took
them isn’t it That’s where we’ll find
Celine

Yellow stops crawling and turns to Enzo CHUCKLING

ENZO (CONTD)

Linda grabs Enzo’s shoulder
LINDA
There’s no time to argue Just let us go

Enzo shrugs out of her grip
ENZO
(cold)
I can’t
Enzo grabs Yellow and lifts him to his feet
Yellow pulls his gun
Enzo bats it away effortlessly
YELLOW
(chuckling)

SLAM

Enzo smashes his fist into Yellow’s chin

Make-up smears and blood drips from his lip as Yellow

CRASHES to the rooftop

Linda tries to hold Enzo back He shoves her out of the
way
ENZO
Stop it She’s Dead Look at him He
doesn’t bargain he doesn’t let anyone

Yellow scampers backward but can’t avoid Enzo’s boot
as

Enzo kicks Yellow in the gut spinning him across the
rooftop onto the arched glass roof of the Galleria

LINDA
Enzo no

Enzo draws his gun and presses it to Yellow’s forehead

ENZO
Is she alive

YELLOW
(looking to the blood on
Enzo’s knuckles)
You don’t want to get any of that on you
I’m diseased you know
Enzo holds the gun by Yellow’s left ear and
BLAM

The Bullet smashes through the glass barely an inch from
Yellow’s ear

Yellow Covers his ear HOWLING from the pain that the
noise caused

YELLOW (CONT’D)
Fuck you

BLAM

This time the bullet goes into the glass just off
Yellow’s right ear

CLINK CLINK CLINK

Spidery cracks appear in the glass of the arched rooftop

Enzo places the gun to Yellow’s forehead again

Enzo whips around to see Linda training Yellow’s gun on
him

the hole in the ceiling

iron support strut

Glass slices through his fingertips

Linda drops the gun and leaps to the hole in the ceiling
reaching out for Yellow

LINDA (CONT’D)
Take my hand

ENZO
Let him go

LINDA
No

Enzo grabs Linda and throws her backward across the
rooftop

She hits her head on a chimney and falls to her knees
stunned

ENZO
No escape I will not allow it

Yellow dangles four stories over the beautifully tiled
floor of the Galleria

Blood drips from his hands which are impaled on jagged
shards of glass

YELLOW
You’ve lost

Enzo reaches out and grabs Yellow’s hand squeezing it
tightly

Yellow HOWLS in pain as the glass digs deeper and deeper
into the flesh of his fingers

ENZO
You will never again harm a soul

Enzo squeezes The glass severs his fingers

ENZO (CONTD)
You’ve lost

Yellow CHUCKLES through the pain as his fingers drop off
one-by-one

Stray cats scatter as

Flashlight beams cut through the darkness as several
POLICE OFFICERS flood into the room

Their lights wipe across

An Officer holds his nose against the stench of bleach

face as she leans against a storefront smoking a
cigarette

She looks up to the hole in the glass ceiling a hundred
feet above her

Planes fly in and out of the nearby airport as we push in
on the multi-level parking facility

We pan down through floor after floor of parked cars

As we descend into the lower levels a faint WHIMPER
grows louderand louder

We hit the bottom floor and glide past row upon row of
cars

The WHIMPER continues to grows louder

We turn a corner to see

THE CAB
We push in on the cab and through the trunk to see

CELINE - WHIMPERING against the blood-streaked duct tape
wrapped around her mouth

Her arms and legs are bound
Her breathing is labored
Blood pools around her as her cries go unheard

LINDA (CONT’D)
Where is she Isn’t that your special
skill To know the mind of a killer
(crying)
Where is she

Linda collapses into Enzo’s chest He tries to wrap his
arms around her consolingly but she pulls back

Enzo is suddenly lost in thought

ENZO

wrong direction from here to make it to
the airport and back Jesus

Realization hits His eyes go wide He dashes to one of
the uniformed officers

Officers try to hold her back but Enzo nods to them and
they release her

Linda stops just short of the open trunk and clamps both
hands over her mouth to stifle her urge to scream

Tears stream down her cheeks as she reaches into the
trunk and cradles the dead Celine in her arms

She sits on the bumper and rocks Celine in her arms
maternally

Crying Linda peels the bloody duct tape from Celine’s
mouth Enzo steps up ti Linda and places a hand on her

her eyes

Linda continues rocking Celine in her arms in a sorrowful
embrace
