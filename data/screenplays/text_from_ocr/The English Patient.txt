1 EXT LATE 1942 THE SAHARA
DESERT DAY

SILENCE THE DESERT seen from the air An
ocean of dunes for mile

after mile The late sun turns the sand every
color from crimson to

black

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara
Its shadow swims over the
contours of sand

A womans voice begins to sing unaccompanied
on the track Szerelem

szerelem she cries in a haunting lament for
her loved one

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures One A
WOMAN seems to be

asleep Her pale head rests against the side
of the cockpit THE

PILOT a man wears goggles and a leather
helmet He is singing too

but we cant hear him or the plane or anything
save the singers
plaintive voice

The plane shudders over a ridge Beneath it A
SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN

AND MACHINES camouflage nets draped over the
sprawl of gasoline tanks

and armored vehicles An OFFICER GERMAN
focuses his field glasses

The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the
plane They are English An

ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE Explosions rock
the plane which lurches

violently THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD slamming
her head against the

instruments The pilot grabs her pulls her
back but shes not

conscious The fuel tank above their heads is
punctured It sprays

them both then EXPLODES

THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY clinging to his
dead lover The are both

ON FIRE She is wrapped in a parachute silk
and it burns fiercely He

looks up to see the flames licking at his own
parachute as it carries

them slowly to earth Even his helmet is on
fire but the man makes no

sound as the flames erase all that matters -
his name his past his

face his lover

2 EXT THE DESERT 1942 DAY

THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN
TRIBESMEN Behind them the

wreckage of the plane still smoking the
Arabs picking over it A

SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun is
retrieved Another man comes

across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it
over to the Pilot The

Pilot is charred His helmet has melted into
his head Hes oblivious

to this cares only about the woman who
crashed with him He twists

frantically to find her Two men pick him up
and carry him across to a

litter where they carefully wrap him in
blankets

3 EXT THE DESERT DUSK
The Pilot is being carried across the desert
A mask covers his face

His view of the world is through the slats of
reed He glimpses

camels fierce low sun the men who carry him

4 EXT AN OASIS DUSK

The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him
takes a date from a sack

and begin to chew it Carefully the Bedouin
eases the mask from the

Pilots face leaving bandages of cloth and
oil but revealing a mouth

He stops chewing and passes the pulped date
into the Pilots mouth

Mouth to mouth

4a EXT DESERT DAWN

THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT
silhouetted against the dunes

5 EXT AN OASIS NIGHT

The SOUND OF GLASS of tiny chimes A music
of glass

AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE
DESERT It floats in

darkness shimmering from the light of a fire
The image develops to

reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from
which hang DOZENS OF

SMALL GLASS BOTTLES on different lengths of
string and wire He could

be an angel

he man approaches the litter which carries
he Pilot Hes still in

he protective reed mask wrapped in blankets
The MERCHANT DOCTOR

stands over the burned body and sinks sticks
either side of him deep

into the sand then moves away free of the
yoke which balances in the

support of the two crutches He puts some
liquid in the Pilots

tongue whose eyes almost instantly begin to
roll Then he slowly sets

about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth
which protect the Pilots

flesh

aateH

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the
curtain of bottles and
MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet
then leans back to pluck

hardly looking certain bottles which he
uncorks and mixes in the bowl

hed made with his feet This mixture he uses
to anoint the burned

skin Next he finds green-black PASTE -
ground Peacock Bone - and

BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilots rib cage
All the while he us

humming and chanting The bottles continue to
jingle

6 EXT ITALIAN HILL ROAD EARLY
1945 DAY

The sand gives way to trees the jingling
bottles to distant church

bells as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red
Cross vehicles and some

supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill
road The war in Italy is

largely over and the Allies are moving up the
country the wounded and

supply lines slowly following

7 INT RED CROSS TRUCK DAY

A young CANADIAN NURSE HANA sits in a truck
full of patients Hana

pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the
stretcher alongside her

This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH
PATIENT A web of scars

covers the Patients face and body They have
the quality of a livid

tattoo magenta and green-black The hair has
largely gone and the

effect is curious lassoing his features the
strong nose the eyes

liquid Its a warriors face But he has no
physical strength He

coughs violently as the trucks shudders along
the road

8 EXT ITALIAN HILL ROAD DAY

A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches
the Red Cross truck

containing Hana and the Patient The horn
blows and Hana looks out to

see it contains her best friend JAN TWO
YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front

one driving both grinning Jan signals for
Hanas attention

JAN
Theres meant to be lace in the

next
village - the boys are taking
me
HANA
Im not sewing anything else
JAN
(mischievously)
You dont have any money do
you

Just in case theres silk

HANA
No

JAN
Hana I know you do

Hana leans under the tarpaulin holding some
DOLLARS The two hands -

hers and Jans - reach for each other as the
vehicles bump along side

by side They laugh at the effort Jans
GOLD BRACELET catches the

sun and glints

HANA
Im not sewing anything else
for you
JAN
(getting the
money)

I love you

The Jeep accelerates away Hana sighs to the
patient

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the
jeep runs over a MINE

The jeep is THROWN into the air The convoy
halts and theres chaos as

soldiers run back pulling people out of the
vehicles Hana runs the

other way towards the accident until she is
prevented from passing by

a soldier

Q EXT ITALIAN HILL ROAD LATER

-- and theres still chaos as two SAPPERS
arrive on motorcycles One
of them a SIKH wears a turban

The motorcycles arrive at the front of the
convoy A nurse MARY is
helping a doctor OLIVER attend to the
injured driver The other two

bodies are covered with blankets Theres
blood everywhere The Sikh

and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia
of their bomb disposal

equipment

10 EXT ITALIAN HILL ROAD DAY

KIP the Sikh Lieutenant and HARDY his
sergeant explore the road

ahead of the becalmed convoy using saucer-
like METAL DETECTORS and

HEADSETS Kip is young lithe contained
utterly focused as they inch

along the debris-strewn road He stiffens as
he registers metal With

a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-
caked surface Something

GLEAMS Suddenly A PAIR OF FEET walks across
his vision as HANA
HURRIES PAST walking carelessly up the road
Its so surreal that

neither man registers at first and then Kip
is shouting

KIP
Hey Hey Stop Hey

HARDY
Dont move Stand ABSOLUTELY
STILL

Hana stops Hardy gingerly follows her
footsteps

HARDY
(as he
approaches)
Good thats good just stay
still for me
and then were going to be
fine

He arrives at Hana Then grabs her Hed
like to slap her face

HARDY
What are you doing What the
bloody
hell do you think youre doing

By way of an answer she looks at the ground
ahead of her feet Jans

BRACELET lies in the mud Hardy bends down
and collects the mangled

bracelet presses it into Hanas hands
11 EXT VILLAGE DUSK

The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED
VILLAGE passing the souvenirs

of war An overturned vehicle now used as a
game by some children

dejected refugees tramping along the side of
the road From the end of

one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN
CORPSES strung upside

down with crude placards denouncing in
Italian their collaboration

with the Nazis

12 INT RED CROSS TRUCK CONTINUOUS

Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside
the truck the Patient

swaying alongside her She puts out her hand
to steady him

13 EXT CONVOY SITE ITALY DUSK

THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP The trucks
are silhouetted in a line

Hana helps lift the Patients stretcher onto
the ground She bends to

him

HANA
Do you need something

The Patient nods Hana gets up to prepare
MORPHINE INJECTION from a

small kit Mary arrives Touches Hana
gently conscious of her grief

for Jans death

MARY
Are you okay Oh God Hana
you were
like sisters
HANA
(sighs angrily)
We keep moving him - in and out
of the

truck Why Hes dying
Whats the point

MARY
Well we cant hardly leave
him Do
you mean leave him We cant

Hana has settled down beside the Patients
stretcher She draws
herself up against the night On the hill
above she can see the

outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight
Shes crying her face

a frozen mask

HANA
I must be a curse Anybody who
loves me
anybody who gets close to me -
or I must be cursed Which is
it

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed
hand

14 EXT THE MONASTERY DAY

Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST
ANNA wandering through its

overgrown gardens past a pond What
sanctuary it seems to offer

15 INT THE MONASTERY LIBRARY DAY

Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY
where the walls have

collapsed from shelling The garden intrudes
ivy curls around the

shelves Bloated books lie abandoned and
theres a PIANO tiled up on

one side Hana presses the keys through the
filthy tarpaulin which

covers it Everywhere there are signs of a
brief German occupation

15a INT MONASTERY CLOISTERS DAY

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS drenched with
silver light

She comes across a small CHAPEL with the
remains of murals and an

altar pressed into service by the Germans as a
table Hana finds an

old bed and a mattress
16 EXT THE MONASTERY GARDEN DAY

Hana comes out passes a DRY WATER TROUGH
She hears a rustling on the

gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling
towards the trough On cue

theres A GURGLING SOUND THE HANDLELESS PUMP
IS SUDDENLY GUSHING

splashing water everywhere The Tortoise
clearly arriving for this

enjoys a welcome shower Hana goes to the
trough dips her hands into

the water Looks around her and makes a
decision

17 EXT CONVOY SITE ITALY DAY

The Convoy is in the final stages of loading
up Oliver passes the

vehicles deep in dispute with a determined
Hana who is carrying some

sacks of rice

HANA
The wars over - you told me
yourself
How can it be desertion

OLIVER
Its not over everywhere I
didnt mean
literally

HANA
When he dies Ill catch up

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small
cache of provisions
then lays another blanket over the Patient

OLIVER

Its not safe here The whole
countrys

crawling with Bandits and
Germans and God

knows what Its madness I
cant allow it

Youre not this is natural -
its shock

For all of us Hana -

HANA
I need morphine A lot Anda
pistol
OLIVER
(clutching at
straws)

And what if he really is a spy
HANA
(impatiently)
He cant even move

OLIVER
If anything happened to you Id
never
forgive myself

Hana nods A tiny smile Oliver shrugs
helplessly

OLIVER
Were heading for Leghorn
Livorno the
Italians call it Well expect
you

18 INT THE MONASTERY DAY

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry
the Patient into the
monastery Hana indicates the stairs

HANA
Up there

They struggle up the stairs one of the
Soldiers gasping as he narrowly

avoids falling into the void in the stairs
The cot almost tips up at

which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS his voice
cracked and rasping but

still clearly aristocratic

THE PATIENT

There was a Prince who was
dying and

he was carried up the tower at
Pisa so he

could die with a view of the
Tuscan Hills

Am I that Prince

Hana laughs

HANA
Because youre leaning No
youre
just on an angle Youre too
heavy

Mary laughs They reach the landing Hana
kicks open the door to the
CHAPEL

HANA
In here
18a INT THE PATIENTS ROOM DAY

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes
to the bed and pulls away

the drapes sending up a cloud of dust They
lower the Patient onto

the bed She turns to the SOLDIERS

HANA
Thank you

She shuts the door on them leaving Mary
staring aghast at the room

its faded frescoes its mold its chaos Hana
smiles opens a shutter

to let a fierce envelope of light into the
room

HANA
Good

She goes to Mary and hugs her

19 INT HANAS ROOM THE MONASTERY
DAY

A smaller upstairs room completely bare As
Hana tugs off her uniform

she looks out of the window to see the
departing Convoy A cotton

dress goes on over her head and she emerges
looking suddenly younger

and rather fragile THROUGH THE DAMAGED
FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A

VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER SHE LOOKS AT
HIM NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS

AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR NOT
AGGRESSIVELY BUT IN A GESTURE OF A

NEW BEGINNING

19a INT THE PATIENTS ROOM DAY

HANA walks down to the Patients Room and
stands in the doorway The

Patient turns his head to her Hes grinning
He puts up a thumb On

the track a song begins Some Other Time

20 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL 1938
LATE DAY

THE SONG IN THE DESERT where we find
the singer - PETER

MADOX a weather-beaten man who is working on
the guts of an BATTERED
TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE His face is blackened
with oil A second

European ALMASY stands beside him holding
tools and a section of the

camshaft Madox yanks out a perished rubber
hose and holds it up for

Almasy to inspect Behind them is an
ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging

in the meager scrub half a dozen black tents
of the BEDOUIN guides

and servants to the AlmasyMadox Expedition
Its 1938 and the whole

continent is full of such expeditions
competing with each other

pursuing lost treasures sources of rivers
hidden cities

DAGOSTINO the teams Italian ARCHEOLOGIST
drives towards the plane

in one of the expeditions adapted FORD
MOTORCARS He gets out

carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR He
looks very pleased with

himself as he shows the jar to Almasy and then
passes it to Madox

DAGOSTINO
Thirsty
MADOX
(sniffing

inside)
Whats this

DAGOSTINO
Dont drink it

He reaches for the jug then pours out a
little sludge - its a
brackish and stinks Madox makes a face

DAGOSTINO
I cant guarantee the vintage
my
friends I just dug it out of
the hill

Madox and Almasy have seen many such jugs

MADOX
Excellent Thats terrific
DAg
(to Almasy of a
tool)
Toss that up would you

DAGOSTINO
(mischievously)
There are some others
21 EXT POTTERY HILL DAY

THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF
POTTERY JARS

DAgostino emerges over the brow of a dune
leading Madox and Almasy

The other members of the team are already
there - BERMANN a German

PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD EGYPTOLOGIST from
Cairo

MADOX
(to Almasy
astonished)
My God look at this

They bend to touch the jars literally
hundreds of them mostly broken

piled on top of each other Bermann
approaches them carrying his

tripod

BERMANN
Incredible Hmm Quite
incredible

DAGOSTINO
Ive never seen anything like
it There
would have been enough water

here to
serve an army
ALMASY
(gloomily)
Which means were in the wrong
place

Almasy speaks with a slight but unmistakable
European accent

DAGOSTINO
Why

ALMASY
Would you stockpile water near
to an
Oasis There cant be a
natural spring
within fifty miles of here

FOUAD
Or they didnt know of one

BERMANN
So it may not be Zerzura
still
incredible
DAGOSTINO
(nodding
delighted)
A pottery hill

ALMASY
A wild goose chase

MADOX
(firmly)
No

Almasy gives him a look But Madox will have
none of it

MADOX
No Now we look in the other
places
Were eliminating

The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE
distracts them

MADOX
Good and here comes
reinforcements
21la EXT BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL
DAY

LATER and a smart new aeroplane a STEERMAN
makes a smooth landing on

the flat desert The expedition team drives
over to meet the arrivals

Almasy is not with them Hes walking
apparently not so enthusiastic

A young kissed and newly-married couple
emerge from the plane They
are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON

And its immediately clear that Katharine is
the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film

Madox makes all the introductions Hands are
shaken hellos all round

as the couple disembark in their leather
flying gear Geoffrey removes

his helmet and in what we will come to know
as an ubiquitous gesture

produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off
the cork with a flourish

CLIFTON
I hereby Christen us the
International
Sand Club
22 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
LATE DAY

The party is in the shade of the tents
Almasy joins the group Madox
nods over to the Clifton plane

MADOX
Marvelous plane Did you look

CLIFTON
(beaming at
Almasy)
Isnt it Wedding present from
Katharines parents Im
calling it
Rupert Bear Hello Geoffrey
Clifton
MADOX
We can finally consign my old
bird
to the scrapheap
Almasy smiles and walks on towards the
others

DAGOSTINO
Mrs Clifton - Count Almasy

KATHARINE
(smiling
offering her hand)
Geoffrey gave me your monograph
when
I was reading up on the desert
Very impressive

ALMASY
(stiff)
Thank you
KATHARINE

I wanted to meet a man who
could write

such a long paper with so few
adjectives

ALMASY
A thing is still a thing no
matter what
you place in front of it Big
car slow
car chauffeur-driven car
still a car

CLIFTON
(joining them
and joining in)
A broken car

ALMASY
Still a car

CLIFFTON
(hands them
champagne)
Not much use though
KATHARINE
Love Romantic love platonic
love

filial love - Quite
different things
surely

CLIFTON
(hugging
Katharine)
Uxoriousness - thats my
favorite kind
of love Excessive love of
ones wife

ALMASY
(a dry smile)
There you have me

23 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM THE
MONASTERY MORNING

The morning floods into the room The Patient
lies lost in the

desert Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE
disturbs him

24 INT STAIRS THE MONASTERY DAY

Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the
cavities of the damaged

stairs and with others she is improvising
new steps The heavy

volumes are perfect for treading on

25 INT LIBRARY DAY
Hana comes in gathers up another armful of

books and carries them out
to continue her stair repairs

26 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM DAY

Hana enters
THE PATIENT
What was all the banging Were
you
fighting rats or the entire
German army

HANA
I was repairing the stairs I
found a
library and the books were very
useful

Hana shrugs Shes attending to him pulling
back the sheets plumping
up the pillows Hes short of breath

THE PATIENT
Before you find too many uses
for these
books would you read some to

me
HANA
I think theyre all in Italian
but Ill
look yes What about your own
book
THE PATIENT
(reluctant)
My book The Herodotus Yes
we

can read him

Hana picks up the book and hands it to him
Then she starts rummaging
in her pockets

HANA
Oh - Ive found plums We have
plums
in the orchard We have an
orchard

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into
his mouth

THE PATIENT
Thank you

His mouth works with the pleasure of the
taste a little juice escaping

from the mouth Hana mops it up

THE PATIENT
The plumness of this plum

A noise GURGLING sound disturbs them

THE PATIENT
Whats that

27 INTEXT THE MONASTERY DAY

Hana comes through the Cloisters into the
garden as the gurgling

increases Shes in time to catch the
TORTOISE arriving once again in

the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush
with water She shouts up

to The Patients open window

HANA
Water
(bends to the
Tortois)
You hear it too dont you
28 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM DAY

Close on the HERODOTUS The Patient opens its
cover held together by

leather ties Loose PAPERS PHOTOGRAPHS
HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES

are all collected between the pages He claws
at some water-colors

which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS -
figures dark-skinned

warriors of the stone age some with bows in
their hands others with

plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract
patterns uncannily like

those of Matisse Some appear to be swimming
another is diving Then

the Patient loses control of the papers and
the whole parcel SPILLS to

the floor with a crack

29 INT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
DUSK

A SHOT RINGS OUT disturbing the evening meal
Almasy and others go

outside Silhouetted on a ridge a group of
men sit astride camels

One of them holds his rifle aloft clearly
pointing towards the sky -

means friend Fouad peers at the horizon

FOUAD
European I think with guides

CLIFTON
(can only see
shapes)
How do you know
MADOX

(frowns)
Yes and I think I know who
this is
30 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
DUSK

ALMASY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE
ARRIVALS as the first Arab

dismounts the procession of camels splaying
out as if in collapse

Almasy speaks in Arabic exchanging the ritual
greetings

DURING THIS FENELON-BARNES sole European in
this expedition has

finally persuaded his camel to sit and
dismounts irritably slapping

the animal in disgust

FENELON-BARNES

Ugly brute Shits and roars
and

complains all day

(bypassing

Almasy and
approaching Madox)

Of course you have your
aeroplane

Two now Do you still call
yourselves

explorers I assume not

MADOX
(stiffly)
Fenelon-Barnes

ALMASY
Yes I think a sailor can call
himself an
explorer cant he Or should

Columbus

have swum to America
31 INT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
DUSK

The arrivals come inside Madox handles the
introductions

MADOX
I think you know all of us
except for
Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton
whove
recently come out from England
CLIFTON
Apprentices

MADOX
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes

FENELON-BARNES
(to Katharine)
I know your mother of course

KATHARINE
Hello

FENELON-BARNES
Im also searching for the lost
Oasis
but by more authentic means

MADOX
(of Almasy)

Anyway my friend here has a
new theory -

that Zerzura doesnt exist So
we may all

be chasing windmills Have
some food

FENELON-BARNES

Well its certainly not
between here and

Dakhla Nine days of nothing
but sand

and sandstorms An egg I
found an

ostrich egg and some fossils

KATHARINE
Isnt Zerzura supposed to be
protected by
spirits who take on the shape
of sandstorms

ALMASY
What kind of fossils

FENELON-BARNES
Ill invite you to my paper at
the
Royal Geographical Society
Are you still a member

He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing
camel milk

ALMASY
I think you know I am

FENELON-BARNES
(ignoring
Almasy)
Quite impossible Madox You
must know

that If you attempt to cross
the Sand

Sea due east of Kufra by car
youll leave

your bones in the sand for me
to collect

ALMASY
(leaving the
tent)
If you come across my bones - I
hope
youll do me the honor of
leaving
them in peace
(to Katharine)
Excuse me
FENELON-BARNES
You have my word as a
gentleman
(watching him
leave)
Ive discovered a unique type
of
sand-dune Ive applied to the
King
for permission to call it
The Fenelon-Barnes Formation
32 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
NIGHT

LATER supper over the company is
entertaining itself

Almasy standing outside his tent watches the
merriment from a
distance

DAg is nearing the end of a passionate
rendition of Puccinis E

Lucevan Le Stelle He sits down to much
applause from the others and

SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand
It comes to rest pointing

at Clifton who gets up grinning and plunges
into Yes We Have No

Bananas with great gusto His version
involves CHANGING LANGUAGE

during each line of the chorus - prompted by
Oui or Ja or Si from

the others Song finished much bowing and
guying he spins the bottle

and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-
Barnes and Katharine - until

with a little NUDGE from the husband it
settles on his wife Katharine
gets up awkward

KATHARINE
I cant sing
(the audience
groans)
but I can tell a story
(to Almasy who
has arrived)
I might need a prompt Do you
have your
Herodotus Ive noticed you
carry it

ALMASY
Im sorry - what have you
noticed

MADOX
Your book Your Herodotus

Almasy looks uncomfortable

KATHARINE
(reacting
quickly)
It doesnt matter Really I
think I can
muddle through Okay - The
Story of
Candaules and Gyges King
Candaules was
passionately in love with his
wife -
(Geoffrey
whistles proudly)
One day he said to Gyges the

son of
somebody anyway - his favorite
warrior -
ALMASY
(quietly
prompting her)
Daskylus
KATHARINE
(smiles)
Yes thank you Gyges son of
Daskylus -
Candaules said to him I dont
think you
believe me when I tell you how
beautiful
my wife is And although Gyges
replied he
did find the Queen magnificent
the King

insisted he would find some way
to prove

beyond dispute that she was
fairest of

all women Do you all know
this story

The men all encourage her to continue her
story

33 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM NIGHT

- and Hanas voice CONTINUES THE STORY as she
reads to the Patient who
listens eyes closed still in the desert

HANA
(reading from
the Herodotus)
I will hide you in the room
where
we sleep said Candaules

She stumbles over the word

THE PATIENT
Candaules

HANA
(not neurotic)
Candaulesyoure laughing at
me

THE PATIENT
Im not laughing at you Go
on please

HANA

When my wife comes to lie down
she always

lays her garments one by one on
a seat

near the entrance of the room
and from

where you stand you will be
able to gaze

on her at your leisure

34 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
NIGHT
KATHARINE
(her story
continuing)
And that evening its exactly
as the

King had told him she goes to
the chair
and removes her clothes one by
one

until she stand naked in full
view of

Gyges And indeed she was more
lovely

than he could have imagined

Almasy stares at her framed by the velvet
black sky Katharine turns
to looks at him

KATHARINE

But then the Queen looked up
and saw

Gyges concealed in the shadows
And

though she said nothing she
shuddered

The next day she sent for Gyges
and

challenged him And hearing
his story
she said this -

CLIFTON
Off with his head

KATHERINE

NAME

death for gazing on that which
you

should not or else kill my
husband who

shamed me and become King in
his place

Clifton makes a face of outrage For
Katherine the story has
collapsed She wants it to be finished

KATHERINE
So Gyges killed the King and
married
the Queen and became ruler of
Lydia
for twenty eight years The
End

(an
uncomfortable moment)
Do I spin the bottle

Almasy shrinks away from the fire disappears
into black

MADOX
(to Clifton)
And let that be a lesson to
you
35 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM NIGHT

Hana looks up from the Herodotus sees the
Patients eyes closed
Gently touches his face and whispers

HANA
Are you asleep

THE PATIENT
(lying)
Yes Dropping off

And Hana closes the book gets up and blows
out the lamp

36 INT FENELON-BARNES TENT POTTERY
HILL NIGHT

PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as
Almasy enters Fenelon-

Barnes tent He pulls apart his luggage
quickly and methodically

WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE Hes approaching

attractive and could be Italian His hands
are bandaged Hana aims

the cross at the soil but is not quite bit or
strong enough The man

CARAVAGGIO chooses this moment to introduce

bicycle on the ground with a clatter

CARAVAGGIO
(very cheerful)
Buon Giorno
Hana turns startled and suspicious

CARAVAGGIO
Are you Hana

HANA
What do you want

CARAVAGGIO

Bonjour

He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand
behind her ear - PRODUCES
AN EGG He beams as does Hana

CARAVAGGIO
Id like to take credit but

Mary My names David

Caravaggio

David

Caravaggio they find to absurd
to

miss out on

During this he attempts the same thing with
his other hand to Hanas

other ear THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND
Cursing he gets on his knees

and starts to scoop it up preserving it

47 INT THE MONASTERY KITCHEN
DAY

Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a
bowl She beats them with

a knife picking out the bits of shell
Caravaggio watches takes in

how little food there is otherwise The table
seems useful more as a

sewing area than for cooking - its STREWN
WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn

into drapes On a tray on the table are TWO
PHIALS OF MORPHINE from
the Patients room As Hana turns to the
stove hes moved and covered

them with his bandaged hands a second later
and hes juggled them into

his pockets with the slightest clink Hana
looks at him He shrugs

nods at the eggs

CARAVAGGIO
Theyre fresh I havent eaten
an egg
inhave you noticed there are
chickens
You get chickens in Italy but

no eggs
In Africa there were always
eggs but
never chickens Who separates
them

thief so

HANA
So you can shoot a pistol
CARAVAGGIO
(showing his
hands)

No

reason You should let me

those bandages Before you go

CARAVAGGIO

Mrs Clifton

KATHARINE

KATHARINE
(turning to face

him)

I dont believe that I think

ALMASY
(of the carpet)

DAY

As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself
overhearing their

conversation as it threads up through the hole
in the ceiling She

strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for
a sheet

THE PATIENT
I think anybody she ever loves
tends to die on her

CARAVAGGIO
Are you planning to be the
exception
THE PATIENT
Me Youve got the wrong end
of
the stick old boy
(a pause)
So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks

such a preposterous name
CARAVAGGIO
I told her you can forget
everything
but you never forget your name

the dying and the

comatose staring out to sea or in slow muted
conversation Hana

walks up to the Patients cabin He is
propped up with a view of the

sea which is interrupted by the pacing
Officer Hana has a blanket

and a chart for the Patients bed She busies
herself

OFFICER

ROARS THE SONG

59 EXT THE MONASTERY HANAS GARDEN
MORNING

A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the
Monastery An ITALIAN

PARTISAN sits in the back a SHOTGUN resting
on his knees The truck

stops and Caravaggio emerges from the
passenger door He collects

some packages from the PARTISAN including a
dead RABBIT and then

exchanges a few words with the driver Hana
whos watching all of

this from her garden sees that the driver is
a WOMAN The womans

name is GIOIA and Caravaggio leans into the
window to make his goodbye

to her

Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as
Hana comes to greet him

He throws her the rabbit and hurries up the
stairs without pausing

clutching the other boxes

CARAVAGGIO
Supper
Hana calls after him

HANA

CARAVAGGIO
(not stopping)
Rabbit hunting

Hana looks at the rabbit Shes angry

61 INT THE MONASTERY UPSTAIRS
CORRIDOR DAY

Hana the rabbit still in her hands comes
along the corridor to find

Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor retching
The discarded NEEDLE lies

beside him the new package of MORPHINE
CAPSULES ripped open He looks

up at Hanna glazed

HANA
I could help you I could
get you off that

CARAVAGGIO
Can you cook the rabbit or will
you
try and bring that back to

She bends starts clearing up putting the
morphine phials back into
the box

HANA
Its a week We didnt know
where you

CARAVAGGIO
(of the drugs)
You should be happy What were

He pulls out more phials from his jacket

HANA

CARAVAGGIO
Some gave me a dress

THE PATIENT
Something smells so rich My
stomach is heaving -

HANA

HANA
He keeps asking me questions
about you
Do you know him Do you

63 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL
DUSK

Almasy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his
rudimentary house while
he draws on the sand talking in some arcane
dialect scratching out a

possible location for the lost oasis The man
stops speaking and

scours the sky a beat or two before we or
Almasy hear the faint noise

of a PLANE Its Cliftons Steerman Rupert
Bear coming in to land

Almasy doesnt look up

The Arab continues to talk The newly-arrived
Katharine has scrambled
up the hill to speak to Almasy

KATHARINE
(diffident)
Hello Not to interrupt but
were celebrating

She makes to leave but Almasy puts up a hand
to keep Katharine there
but quiet

ALMASY

This is an incredible story -
about a man

hunting an Ostrich hes been
telling me

about Zerzura he thinks hes
been there

but his map the route hes
describing

he couldnt survive the journey
now but

hes a poet so his map is
poetry - and

now were onto an Ostrich

(to the Arab in

ARABIC

Im telling her your map is
poetry

The Arab shrugs

KATHARINE
What do you mean poetry

ALMASY
A mountain curved like a
womans back
a plateau the shape of an ear

KATHARINE
Sounds perfectly clear Where
does
the Ostrich come in

ALMASY
The Ostrich is a detour A
poor man hunts
an ostrich its the method
Nothing to do

with Zerzura To catch an
ostrich you must

appear not to move The man
finds a place

where the ostrich feeds a
wadi and stands

where the ostrich can see him
on the

horizon and doesnt move
doesnt eat -

otherwise the ostrich will run
At nightfall

he moves fifty sixty yards
When the

ostrich comes the next day the
man is

there but hes nearer

(to the guide)
Haunting the ostrich

The Guide speaks amplifying something
picking at his robe

ALMASY

Yes the ostrich it will feed
a family

not just the meat but by
selling the

feathers beak the skin a
year from

this one animal So each day
the

man gets closer And the
ostrich is

not sure - has something

changed -

now the standing man is only a
few

yards from where it feeds And
then

one day the man is in the
wadi in

the water And the Ostrich
comes as

always dips into the water and
the

man JUMPS UP - and captures it

He shrugs The Arab has more to say Almasy
doesnt respond quieting
him with a dismissive gesture

KATHARINE
What is he saying
(Almasy
awkward shakes his head)
Come on what did he say
ALMASY
He said - be careful

KATHARINE
Be careful You mean you - or
me Who

ALMASY
(to the Arab)
Her or me

The Arab speaks again Almasy speaks without
looking at her

ALMASY
The one who appears not to be
moving
64 INT TENT BASECAMP AT POTTERY

HILL NIGHT

Katharine comes in Then a beat and Almasy
Clifton is holding up
the champagne

CLIFTON

KATHARINE
(to Clifton)
Why do you think About my
staying

CLIFTON
Well look if nobody minds
truly then
I suppose - I shall of course

be bereft
KATHARINE
(playfully
poking his ribs)
Oh
CLIFTON
But finally able to explore the
Cairo
night-life I shall produce an
authoritative guide to the Zinc
Bars
and - I want to say Harems - am
I in
the right country for Harems
65 EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL

As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman
Almasy approaches

CLIFTON

ALMASY

CLIFTON
(laughing it
off)
Why are you people so
threatened

by a woman

He settles into the controls Almasy watches
the plane taxi away

Doesnt move at all Katharine waves from the
tent as the Steerman

takes off

65a EXT BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite loaded
for a scouting

expedition The rest of the party Bedouin
tents camels and Tiger

Moth is left behind Madox shouts last-minute
instructions from the

window of his car
66 EXT DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF
SWIMMERS DAY

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel and
wipes away the sweat The

desert stretches for miles shimmering the
sun baking the sand His

GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter Nobody
speaks Then one of them

looks round raises a hand A BUZZING noise
They all turn A SMALL

CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE Locusts
A sandstorm

A CARAVAN OF CARS the AlmasyMadox
expedition bumps along

suspensions threatened by the constant dips
and ridges On each car

there are three in the passenger cabin the
open backs crammed with

drums of gasoline and water and equipment On
the front vehicle the

tenth member of the party KAMAL acts as a
navigator and sits ona

CAMEL SADDLE a rodeo cowboy on the roof of
the leading car driven by

Madox As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound
their horns and wave

good-naturedly F-B scowls watches them roar
by stealing his

thunder

66a EXT DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF
SWIMMERS DAY

ONE OF THE CARS IS HOPELESSLY BOGGED DOWN IN
HEAVY SAND Its contents

have been unloaded and a rope ladder is being
inserted under the

tires The entire company huff and puff and
argue about the best means

of extricating the vehicle

67 INT CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF
SWIMMERS DAY

LATER - Almasy drives the second car
accompanied by Katharine and Al
Auf Katharine breaks the long silence

KATHARINE
Ive been thinking about - how
does
somebody like you decide to
come to

the desert What is it
Youre doing
whatever youre doing - in your
castle

or wherever it is you live and
one day

you say I have to go to the
desert - or what

Almasy doesnt answer Katharine who has
looked at him for an answer
looks away Theres another long silence

ALMASY

I once traveled with a terrific
guide

who was taking me to Faya He
didnt

speak for nine hours At the
end of

it he pointed at the horizon
and

said - Faya That was a good
day

Point made they lapse again into silence
Katharine boils

KATHARINE
Actually you sing

ALMASY
Pardon

KATHARINE
You sing All the time

ALMASY
I do not
KATHARINE
Ask Al Auf

Almasy asks Al Auf in Arabic He laughs
nods

KATHARINE
(sings wickedly)
Ill be down to get you in the
taxi
honey youd better be ready
about
half-past eight

Al Auf nods and grins furiously joins in
impersonating Almasy
Almasy grunts in irritation

68 EXT NEAR THE BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF
SWIMMERS DUSK
The group is investigating a cleft in the
rocky massif They climb

slowly Below them A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE
CAMP

The group winds around the rock Almasy turns
to offer a hand to

Katharine behind him pulling her up to the
next rock slab She smiles

at him He smiles back curtly continues

The group stops at a level plateau The Arabs
stand apart and SING

THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK Al Auf leads the
incantations

AL AUF
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar

The westerners wait respectfully As the sun
sets in glory Almasy

looks over at the range of rocks One
particular range seems to look

exactly like A WOMANS BACK He squints at
the rock Almasy

discreetly pulls out his COMPASS

69 EXT CAVE OF SWIMMERS DUSK

Almasy clambers up the rocks coming through a
narrow crevice to find A

NATURAL SHELF He scrambles up this path
reaching up only to notice

that his hand almost perfectly covers A
PAINTED HAND on the rock and

as he digests this he realizes he has climbed
past what is THE MOUTH OF

A CAVE He disappears inside

70 INT CAVE OF SWIMMERS
FLASHLIGHT

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave Almasy
treads cautiously along the

narrow winding passage He comes to an open
cavern and takes his

flashlight up to a wall PAINTINGS EMERGE
figures animals ancient

pictures A giraffe Cattle Fish Men
with bows and arrows

Almasy is astonished by what he sees

71 EXT NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS
EVENING

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and
jerks among the rocks as
Almasy comes scrambling down transformed into
an excited teenager

ALMASY
Madox Madox

He slithers in a heap in front of the
astonished expedition party
Doesnt care

72 INT CAVE OF SWIMMERS
FLASHLIGHT

Almasy has led the whole party into the heart
of the cave Now Madox

comes alongside him at the wall his
flashlight joining Almasys and

increasing the visibility of the paintings A
dark-skinned figure

apparently in the process of DIVING into
water comes clearly into

view Then others supine arms outstretched

MADOX
(with audible
excitement)
My God theyre swimming

The others crowd round FIVE EXCITED FACES IN
THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE
CAVE

73 EXT CAVE OF SWIMMERS DAY

A hive of activity The team has set up
TRESTLES to catalogue the

finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of
detritus which they

empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is
cleared out Entering the

cave Almasy passes with camera equipment
just as DAg emerges

carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved
DESERT FOX DAg gestures

to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm
holding up the body of the

fox
DAGOSTINO
Have you seen this
Astonishing
Perfectly preserved
74 INT CAVE OF SWIMMERS DAY

Inside Bermann is setting up LAMPS running
wires from a car BATTERY
Kamal is helping him And as Almasy arrives
he catches a tiny moment

of tenderness between them Bermann seeing
him quickly disengages

and busies himself with the lights At
another wall Katharine is

catching

75 EXT THE DESERT DAY

The CARS are heading back to Basecamp They
bounce over the sand

76 INT BERMANNS CAR DAY

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some
STEEP DUNES Almasy beside

him Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE a segment
of which he holds out of

the window Kamal riding shotgun leans down
and collects it his

head dipping in to grin at Bermann Bermann
looks uneasily as Almasy

He wants to tell him of his passion of his
absolute love for Kamal

but he darent

BERMANN

I love the desert you see
Thats my

thats my - I cant think of
the word

(Almasy nods)

How do you explain To someone

whos

never been here Feelings
which seem
quite normal

ALMASY
(compassionate)
I dont know my friend I
dont know

Bermann holds out another segment of the
orange and watches the slim

brown hand collect it A MOMENTARY
DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM

TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE
COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND

THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE
EDGE DAg - following

Fouad beside him - brakes sharply but cant
stop his own car from

being caught in the avalanche of sand and IT
PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND

INTO BERMANNS UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS
CRUNCH the radiator
exploding Only Madox Katharine beside him
and a little way behind

manages to stay clear of the trouble He
jumps out of the vehicle and

slides down the dune to find pandemonium as
the passengers stumble out

of the cars sand flying smoke pouring from
the upright vehicle the

wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly
in the air a puddle of

oil spreading ominously

77 EXT THE DESERT DAY

LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as
possible DAg

Bermann and Fouad are a little worse for
wear Fouads arm is ina

sling and DAg is sporting a bloody head-
bandage Bermann has broken

a finger and is being attended to by Madox
The luggage water and

petrol have been stacked up and the men are
loading up the remaining

car Almasy is working at the crumpled end of
the vehicle Hes

having no success

78 EXT THE DESERT DAY

Almasy Kamal and two of the other young
Bedouin stand around the mess

of the two broken vehicles The ONE WORKING
CAR is loaded with men and

provisions Katharine sits inside next to
Madox Almasy comes over to

her window to speak past her to Madox

MADOX
Ill be back as quick as I can
Thirty-six hours at the

outside
ALMASY

Try to get a second radiator
well bury

it between here and the Pottery
Hill

And a better jack We planned
badly

MADOX
(nods at Almasy
then shouts over
to the wrecked vehicles)
Bermann

This is Bermanns cue to take leave of Kamal
who is staying behind
Kamal makes a little bow

KAMAL
May God make safety your
companion

Bermann nods and hurries away squeezing into
the car which jolts off
bouncing over the track

THE VEHICLE GETS ABOUT TWENTY YARDS ALMASY
WATCHING BEFORE IT SINKS

FORLORNLY INTO THE SOFT SAND ITS HOPELESSLY
OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE

THEY ALL GET OUT

KATHARINE
I shall stay behind of course

MADOX
Certainly not

KATHARINE

I insist There clearly isnt
room for

us all Im the least able to
dig and

Im not one of the walking
wounded

Those are facts Besides if I
remain

its the most effective method
of

persuading my husband to
abandon

whatever hes doing and rescue
us

Its hard to argue with this logic Almasy
shrugs

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective
departure And Almasy and

Katharine are left alone THEY LOOK AT EACH
OTHER as if realizing this

for the first time Almasy immediately
returns to the two damaged

vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut
canvas which was once a tent

TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO
CARS Katharine goes to

join them There is no obstacle to the
remorseless horizon just miles

of undulating dunes

719 INT SHELTER DAY

Almasy sits alone writing into HIS HERODOTUS
a map folded in front of

him from which he makes notes Katherine
comes across with a clutch

of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall Hands
them to him Theyre

beautiful
ALMASY
Whats this
KATHARINE
I thought you might paste them
into your book
ALMASY
We took several photographs
theres no need
KATHARINE
Id like you to have them
ALMASY
(handing them
back)
Theres really no need This
is
just a scrapbook I should
feel
obliged Thank you
KATHARINE
(exasperated)
And that would be
unconscionable
I suppose to feel any
obligation

Yes Of course it would

Shes already turning walking as far from him
as the cramped shelter
permits He continues with his maps

80 EXT THE DESERT NIGHT

Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune
smoking surveying the

landscape Below her the makeshift camp - a
fresh wind flicking at the

tarpaulin THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOXS CAR
STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS

CIVILIZATION Almasy emerges from the tent
and locating Katharine

heads towards her

ALMASY
You should come into the
shelter

KATHARINE
Im quite all right thank you

ALMASY
Look over there

Katharine turns scans the horizon

KATHARINE
What am I looking at

ALMASY
See whats happening to them -
the stars

KATHARINE
Theyre so untidy Im just
trying
to rearrange them
ALMASY
In an hour there will be no
stars

The air is filling with sand

He offers a hand A little reluctantly she
takes it

81 EXT SHELTER NIGHT

The team hurries around the improvised tent
weighing it down with

packing cases gasoline drums water cans
bringing anything loose or

light inside the tarpaulin THE WIND is
whipping up the air busy with

sand Almasy pushes everyone under cover

82 INT SHELTER NIGHT

THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN
Kamal and Almasy try to

secure one vulnerable area but suddenly there
are leaks everywhere and

the sand swarms inside

Its noisy too and Almasy has to shout to
make himself understood

indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and
blankets and food all the

valuables and get out He himself finds
blankets and water and shouts

at Katharine to do the same One side of the
canvas suddenly RIPS

apart like paper Chaos as figures struggle in
ever-worsening

conditions sand blizzarding the air
83 EXT SHELTER NIGHT

THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR stranding the
figures their heads

wrapped in blankets flashlights useless
They seek safety in two

groups the tribesmen to the cabin of the
overturned car Katharine and

Almasy to the upright one

84 INT CAR NIGHT

Inside the cabin the sand swirling around
them Katharine and Almasy

sit without speaking Dawn is trying to break
through He pours a

little water into a mug so that they can wash
out their eyes and noses

and mouths She takes her silk scarf and
first dries her eyes with it

then dries his

KATHARINE
This is not very good is it

ALMASY
No

KATHARINE
Shall we be all right

ALMASY
Yes Absolutely

KATHARINE
Yes is a comfort Absolutely
is not
85 EXT THE DESERT DAWN

The sand is piling up against the two cars
the tent is swept from its

moorings the water cans are hurled up too
and then plunge ominously

into sand drifts as if going under an ocean

ALMASY (0S)
let me tell you about winds

There

is a whirlwind in Southern
Morocco the

Aajej against which the
fellahin defend

themselves with knives The
Ghibli from

Tunis rolls and rolls and
produces a

rather strange nervous
condition

And we hear Katharines laugh

86 INT CAR DAWN

Almasy sits alongside Katharine whose head is
against his shoulder
He continues his story of winds

ALMASY

NAME

Which Mariners called the sea
of

darkness Red sand from this
wind

has flown as far as the south
coast

of England producing showers
so

dense they were mistaken for
blood

Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still
awake

KATHARINE
Fiction We had a house on
that coast
and it never rained blood Go
on More

ALMASY
All true Herodotus your
friend tells
of a wind - the Simoon - so
evil that a
nation declared war on it and

marched

out to fight it in full battle
dress

their swords raised
87 EXT THE DESERT DAY

MORNING The sand has almost COMPLETELY
ENGULFED the car on the

exposed side covering the windshield like
snow and encroaching onto

the door of the protected flank

88 INT CAR DAY

Almasy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE
He jerks up waking

Katharine in the process and heaves against
the door He cant open
it and has to lean his feet against the
passenger door lying across
Katharine kicking it open

89 EXT THE DESERT DAY

By the time Almasy emerges from the car the
sand pouring into the

cabin MADOXS CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE
HORIZON Almasy waves shouts

and then runs back into the car finds his
flare-gun and SENDS A FLARE

high into the sky Katharine is with him now
and they watch

helplessly as the car bounces away from them
Madox a man ona

mission Katharine panics THE SAND HAS
ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM

She speaks quietly shocked

KATHARINE
Our tracks where are they

Almasy is preoccupied Hes gone back to
their vehicle and returns
with a shovel STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY

ALMASY
Madox will have calculated how
many
miles theyll soon turn
around

KATHARINE
(realizing what
hes doing)
Oh my God the others

She kneels with him and helps to shovel away
the sand WHICH HAS

COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE
containing the three Bedouin

ALMASY
(during this)
Could I ask you please to
paste you
paintings into my book I
should like
to have them I should be

honored
KATHARINE
Of course Is it amla
terrible
coward to ask how much water we
have

ALMASY
(shoveling hard)
Water Yes we have water we
have
a little in our can we have
water in
the radiator which can be
drunk Not
at all cowardly extremely
practical
(anxious at not
uncovering
the boys egging himself on)
Come on come on
(then back to
Katharine)
Theres also a plant - Ive
never seen
it but Im told you can cut a
piece the
size of a heart from this plant

and
the next day it will be filled
with a
delicious liquid
KATHARINE
Find that plant Cut out its
heart

They hear NOISES scrabbling faint thumps
Almasy scrapes at the sand

and they find the glass of the car The angle
of the cab tilted up to

the sky has made it impossible for the
trapped boys to lever it open

Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating Almasy
pulls the door and it

cranks open

90 EXT THE DESERT DAY

Katharine sits in the car putting her
pictures into the Herodotus

Its full of ALMASYS HANDWRITING
PHOTOGRAPHS SOME PRESSED FLOWERS

She deciphers a page of his words and
drawings Its almost

exclusively about her the lines studded with
Ks She reads

astonished then looks at him as he and two of
the three Bedouin circle

the area of the cars in ever-widening circles
like water-diviners

like Kip searches for mines Kamal is slumped
against the front of the

car Hes sick Almasy suddenly drops to his
knees and begins to

shovel into the sand He pulls out A CAN OF
WATER Turns to Katharine
and holds it triumphantly in the air

9g1 INT THE DESERT NIGHT

Theres a small weak fire The group crouch
around it The boys talk

noisily to Almasy Kamal is wrapped in a
blanket and shivering

Almasy gives him water speaks to Katherine

ALMASY

Kamal is passing blood He
must have

had some internal damage in the
crash

He needs medicine I think we
must risk

the other flare

He gets up and loads the flare with what is
clearly the last charge

This time the effect is dramatic with A RED
UMBRELLA OF LIGHT

Katharine comes up beside him They wait
hope fading with the flare

KATHARINE
(blank)
Geoffreys not in Cairo
(Almasy looks at

her)

Hes not actually a buffoon
And

the plane wasnt a wedding

present It belongs to the
British

Government They want aerial

maps of the whole North Africa

So I think hes in Ethiopia
In

case you were counting on his

sudden appearance

ALMASY

And the marriage - is that a

fiction

Theres a beat Katharine has a hundred
answers

KATHARINE
No the marriage isnt a
fiction

The light from the flare fades on them and
they stand in the dark

Suddenly on the far horizon behind their
heads AN ANSWERING FLARE

fireworks into the sky
KATHARINE
Thank God Oh thank God

Theres excited shouting from the two fit
boys They leap up and run

towards the couple who meanwhile have
realized that the flare has not

come from Madox but from an approaching CAMEL
CARAVAN Almasy shouts

to the boys for some identification

KATHARINE
Do they know them

ALMASY
(squinting at
the horizon)
No but I think I do

The Caravan slowly comes into focus ITS
FENELON-BARNES Katharine

touches Almasys arm - an almost imperceptible
gesture

KATHARINE
Am I K in your book
I think I must be

Almasy turns to her He runs the blade of his
arm across her neck -
the sweat leaving a clear stripe

Fenelon-Barnes approaches dismounts from his
camel and addresses

Almasy
FENELON-BARNES
I recollect your saying to
ignore
your bones but I assume you
have
no objection to my rescuing
your
companion
(to Katharine)
Good evening Mrs Clifton
KATHARINE
(accepting his
handshake)
Hello
FENELON-BARNES
Id like to introduce you to my
camel -
the most notable beast on
earth

(to Almasy)
I understand you found some
remarkable caves

A goatskin bag of water is offered to
Katharine She drinks and hands
it to Almasy

FENELON-BARNES
Paintings of swimmers
Remarkable

92 EXT CAIRO DAY

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing
Almasy and Katharine
negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo

93 EXT SHEPHEARDS HOTEL DAY

Almasy still in the same clothes and
evidently weary emerges from

the cab and pulls Katharines belongings from
the trunk then holds

open the door for her As she walks towards
the hotel he hands her

bag to a porter Katharine is stung

KATHARINE
Will you not come in

ALMASY
No

KATHARINE
Will you please come in

ALMASY
(a beat)
Mrs Clifton -

Katharine turns disgusted

KATHARINE

book

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack
shoves it at him then
disappears

94 INT ALMASYS ROOM DAY

Almasy lying on a camp bed face down The
walls are covered with
maps enlargements of photographs A fan
hirs over his kit which is

pread unraveled but ordered on the stone
loor An ineffably male

oom the shutters closed just the thinnest
haft of light piercing

lothes his boots kicked

ff below his jutting feet

OoNatFHKRHNH

Theres A KNOCK at the door Almasy sleeps
Another A third Hes

roused from the dead Stumbles to his feet
opens the door as the

knocking continues

Its Katharine Shes bathed luminous
stands back-lit by the

afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress
She walks past him into

the room He closes the door She turns He
KNEELS before her head

at her thighs Shes crying her face
expressionless as her hands go

to his head

KATHARINE
You still have sand in your
hair

She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders
violently He pulls

back to look at her the tears streaming down
her face She kneels

and covers his face with kisses He pulls
blindly at her dress and it

RIPS across her breasts

95 INT BATHROOM DAY

Almasy is in the bath Katharine wearing his
dressing gown pours in

a jug of steaming water Almasy leans over
the rim of the bath Hes

sewing carefully repairing the torn dress

KATHARINE
Im impressed you can sew

ALMASY
Good

KATHARINE
You sew very badly

ALMASY
You dont sew at all

KATHARINE
A woman should never learn to
sew
and if she can she should never
admit to it Close your eyes

ALMASY
(laughs)
That makes it harder still

She pushes the sewing from his hands then
pours water over his head
then begins to shampoo his hair

Almasy is in heaven The biggest smile we
have seen from him She
continues to massage his scalp

ALMASY
When were you most happy

KATHARINE
Now

ALMASY
When were you least happy

KATHARINE
(a beat)
Now

ALMASY
Okay And what do you love
Say everything

KATHARINE
What do I love I love rice

Almasy nods
ALMASY
What do you hate most

KATHARINE
A lie What do you hate most

ALMASY
Ownership Being owned When
you leave you should forget
me

She freezes pulls herself away out of the
bath looks at him then
SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face

She picks up her dress the thread and needle
dangling from it and
walks dripping out of the room

96 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM NIGHT

To the Patient its as if Katharine is walking
out of his wall He

sighs with pain then looks away to where Hana
has fallen asleep on the

bed almost on top of him He touches her

He speaks as if each word

burns him

THE PATIENT
Could I ask you to move Im

bandaged face is bloated and

yellow Hes not breathing She bends over
him his open eyes fixed

in a glassy stare No pulse She snaps the
triangular cardboard ID

from his bed to indicate HES DIED Then
tenderly closes his eyes

THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN HE REARS UP
GRABBING HER

WOUNDED SOLDIER
Cant wait to have me dead

is absolutely shocked But just as suddenly
hes sunk back into semi-

consciousness

Shaken she sits by him and takes his hand he
pulls it away she takes

it again He is in terrible pain His face
creased with anger Now

his hand is clutching at hers She tries to
soothe him

HANA

He walks towards her his smile awful

ALMASY

Then she turns sharply from him and catches
her head against the

gatepost staggers at the shock of it then
hurries away

132 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM MORNING

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room
shuttered against the

morning light His breathing is noticeably
worsening a shudder of a

breath the shallow rise and fall of his chest
perceptible Hana

frets touches his wrist feeling for the
pulse

THE PATIENT
Im still here

HANA
Youd better be

THE PATIENT
Dont depend on it Will you
That little bit of air each
day

right

She squeezes his hand suddenly overwhelmed
THE PATIENT
(brightly)

Ive been talking to Caravaggio

research assistant - theres

a ghost in the Cloisters I

Theres some kind of noise from the garden
Muffled shouts

THE PATIENT
Its the boy

Hana goes to the window opens the shutters
The day pours in

132A EXT MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES DAY

Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at
the far perimeter of the

garden in the olive groves HIS HANDS RAISED
ABOVE HIM HIS LEG HELD

OUT STRANGELY WIRES run from his foot in all
directions as if hed

trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb

133 EXT MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES DAY

Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves
and hurries towards Kip
who hasnt moved He shouts warning her

KIP
Go to the left Keep to the
left There
are mines and trip wires
everywhere

Hana stops hoists up her skirt and circles
left tentative in the long
grass He shouts doesnt want her close

KIP
Get Hardy Hes on the other
side of
town In the hills Get him
to hurry

She keeps coming can see that he needs her

HANA
Its okay - Ill help Please

KIP
The mines the wires theres a
trick
Some explode if you stretch the
wires
some if you cut them

HANA
What do I do

KIP
Theres a mine here but the
others are
far enough away I think at

least to

give me a chance I have to
work out

which one to cut before I fall
over

HANA
So I follow the wires

KIP
You get Hardy

HANA
I follow the wires

She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the
tangled route of the web

KIP
Dont touch them

She follows one wire back to the closest mine
and traces another back

to Kips foot Then she finds another one
leading off to a second mine

some thirty metres away

HANA
Why would anyone do this

KIP
Ive done this Ive had to do
this

Then Hanas suddenly tense

HANA
Give me a second

She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER
AREA straight to what
had seized her attention Kip is appalled

KIP
What are you doing Hana

Heedless she dodges another mine and its web
of wires just as THE
TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock which
is in fact ANOTHER
CONCRETE-COVERED MINE

Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the
metal She turns

holding the protesting animal in triumph HER
FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE

She has to ease it off in arabesque still
clutching the tortoise

She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting
down the animal Then

shes back with Kip Hes seething She is
strangely elated

KIP
What is this business with you
and
explosives Do you think
youre immune

HANA
I promise you that was the
right thing
to do Hes my good luck
(she gets the
pliers from his belt
and hands them to him)
Now cut This one
(she indicates

the wire)
I hope we dont die
KIP
Okay Get away from here
Quick
HANA
Im not scared So many people
have
died around me But I would be
a

shame for us
(shrugs)
I dont feel like being shy

KIP
You must get away Before I
cut Im
not cutting if youre here

Hes struggling Hes going to topple over if
he cuts

HANA
Actually you cant cut can
you
Youll fall over Give me the
pliers

KIP
No

But he hands them over

HANA
Kiss me Before I cut Just
in case
KIP
Dont talk Check again Lie
flat and

then cut

Hana checks lies down He bends as close to
the ground as he dares
AND KISSES HER THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS

134 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM
CONTINUOUS

The Patient lies in bed Hes agitated by the
silence SUDDENLY

THERES AN EXPLOSION He tries to shout a
croak which quickly reduces

him to coughing and breathlessness

THE PATIENT
Hana Hana Kip Hana

He tries to move He cant Hes frantic
FOOTSTEPS as someone hurtles up the stairs

Its Hana Shes ashamed
to have forgotten him She rushes to him

HANA
Im sorry I forgot youd be
worrying
Were all safe It was a mine
but not
the mine Nobodys hurt Im
sorry

She calms him Hes exhausted His eyes
shine

135 EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD ITALY
LATE DAY

Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE
hares along the circling

road She has her arms around his waist His
head turns to her fora

second and she smiles

136 EXT ROAD BLOCK TUSCANY
DUSK
Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD
BLOCK Kip is being

questioned at a sentry post his papers over-
thoroughly inspected and

accompanied by several meaningful glances at
Hana who waits standing

by the motorcycle One of the SOLDIERS
saunters over and returns her

papers
SOLDIER
And youre definitely traveling
with
him of your own free will
HANA
Yes
SOLDIER
(clearly
disapproving)
Just wanting to be sure And
hes

taking you to church

HANA
(deadpan)
Yes Were going to a funeral
A cow has
died And in his religion
theyre sacred

The Soldier isnt sure what to make of this
He signals to his

companion who returns Kips papers Kip walks
back to the motorcycles

He says nothing He kicks the starter Hana
gets on slides her arms

lovingly around him

137 EXT BRIDGE ITALY DUSK

ITS GETTING DARK The bike headlights on
crosses a bridge Kip has

strapped on his crimson emergency light as
they sail along the winding

crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down
Italy

138 EXT AREZZO DUSK

Kip steers the motorbike into the
deserted PIAZZA

They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his
bulging satchel and unload
the panniers Hana still doesnt know whats
in store and looks
questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the
door of the CHURCH

139 INT CHURCH DUSK

They enter the Church Its in almost total
darkness THEN A FLARE

SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR Its
magnificent Kip holds the

flare crimson on one arm green pouring up
from the other Hana walks

behind him still perplexed There is
PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING

EVERYWHERE AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND
THE ALTARS AND THE

STATUES

A SECOND FLARE Kip has appeared through A
SECRET DOOR high in the

church literally emerging from one of the
frescoes which are

momentarily visible He flings a rope over
the rafters

Now Kip circles Hana with the rope MAKING A
SLING across her waist and

shoulder He lights a smaller flair and hands
it to her before

disappearing

Hana stands holding the flare She cant see
Kip can only hear him
scrambling

HANA
Kip

He runs up the sandbags right up into the
rafters He collects the

other end of the rope which is attached to
Hana Holding onto it he

just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR
her startled yelp echoing

around the Church Kip touches ground while
Hana swings through

space coming to rest about three feet from
the FRESCOED WALLS painted

by Piero Della Francesca Hanas flare makes
a halo around her head

Now Kip on the ground still holding the
rope walks forward and

causes Hana to SWING to the right She lets
out a giddy laugh

exhilarated and nervous and she flies
illuminating - en passant -
faces bodies angels Kip guides the rope as
if they were making
love which in a way they are

Hana arrives hovering in front of THE QUEEN
OF SHEBA TALKING TO

SOLOMON Shes overwhelmed She reaches out
to touch the giant neck of

the sad Queen

Kip slowly lets her down paying out the
length of the rope Hanas
face is full of tears He smiles holds her

British pounds
And if you pick up a telephone
everybodys practicing their
German
(holds up some
gramophone records)
What do you do - do you take

these

things

(then awkward)

Look Moose we need you to
stay in

Tobruk A bit of a short straw
but

the thinking is well be back -
I mean

we will be back - butand in
the

interim we need eyes and ears
on

the ground

A BIG BOMB lands nearby The building
shudders and plaster dust drops
from the ceiling Almost oblivious the two

CARAVAGGIO
We have 30 000 troops in

FENELON-BARNES
(continuing to
pack)
Giving Rommel a bloody nose
Thats
my suggestion But did you
hear
the BBC last nigh Tobruk is
of no

strategic importance - makes
you wonder

AICHA is at the bottom of the stairs She
falls into step

FENELON-BARNES

Jerrys got our maps you know
Swines

Before the war we helped them
run about

the desert making maps - and
now they

get spies into Cairo using our
maps theyll

get Rommel into Cairo using our
maps

The whole of the desert like a
bus route

and we gave it to them Any
foreigner who

turned up - welcome to the
Royal Geographic

One Guard has got to his feet and grips
Caravaggio around the neck in

half-nelson others holding his legs while
Miller approaches

Caravaggio cant move Hes gurgling as the
Guard almost strangles

him His eyes are streaming with tears

Now Miiller is at his other hand and the ROAR
of pain again lifts

round his fists

CARAVAGGIO

THE BOMB Hardy supervises The bombs huge -
2 000 lbs and

protrudes ostrich-like from the pit its nose
sunk into a pool of

sludge at the base of the viaduct

Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud
grunting in disgust

Warily he touches his huge opponent feeling
the condition of the

case He wipes the metal Reveals a serial
number calls it out to

Back in the shaft Kip works away his fingers
shaking with the cold

from the oxygen hes using to freeze the fuse
Suddenly theres a

VIOLENT TREMOR The ground is SHUDDERING and
the bomb slips horribly

Kip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to
stop a man from falling

instead it falls on him pushing him into the
sludge

Three Sappers run across the bridge towards
the oncoming procession

They wave their orange flags the tanks wave
back wit their flags -

Stars and Stripes Union Jacks Now SHOTS are
ringing out In the

shaft oblivious Kip slides out from under
the bomb the oxygen

spurting everywhere all over his clothes
hissing on the surface of

the water Hardy bends into the shaft
heedless of his own safety

HARDY
Youve got to cut sir that

frost
wont last
KIP
Go away
HARDY
Yessir
KIP
This is making me incredibly
angry

He rubs his hands to warm them up locates his
needle pliers and slips

them through the tiny gap His hand touches
the casing and the freeze

BURNS his hand He jerks back DROPPING THE
PLIERS into the sludge

cursing

Now hes on his hands and knees in the sludge
trying frantically to

find the pliers Hardy looks at his watch he
cant help The seconds

run out as Kip grovels in the mud Totally
submerged he suddenly

comes out with the pliers goes straight to
the fuse no finesse and

cuts Theres a snip Then nothing Then
Kip laughs at Hardy

KIP
Kiss me

Hardy is already at the winch hauling it up
Kip can hardly clip on

the halter - his hands numb and burned As
the pulley jerks he just

clings on rising from the grip of the mud
like an ancient corpse out

of a bog

The other sappers have gathered around the
edge of the site Great
elation on their faces

HARDY
Get a blanket
(not getting
attention)
Dade Get the Lieutenant a
blanket

KIP
Then Id think there must be a
reason

HANA

But she continues unraveling the turban

HANA

all

176 EXT BASECAMP AT CAVE OF SWIMMERS
1939 DAY

Almasy sits on a ridge transferring map of
information from his

Herodotus onto a sheet of paper He looks up
at the sound of Cliftons

approaching Steerman He folds up the map and
sticks it inside one of

Cliftons CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it
between the rocks

176a INT STEERMAN DAY

Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf
Kebir From the air its

possible to make out Almasy scrambling down
from the ridge towards

where the stones indicate a landing area
carrying the last of the

materials from the Cave of Swimmers Almasy
waves in recognition and

welcome

177 EXT BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF
SWIMMERS DAY

Almasy watches as the plane drops towards him
shielding his eyes

against the sun the plane bounces along the
runway not quite

landing Almasy continues packing the
equipment

Almasy looks up to see the plane swerve now
suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT

TOWARDS HIM Hes completely vulnerable
nowhere to run He dives at

the ground THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN
INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS

OVER AND OVER the wings snapping off like
twigs as it hurtles past the

prostrate Almasy He gets to his feet and
starts to run towards the

wreckage

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the
plane but no fire Almasy
pulls away the debris to find GEOFFREY -
SLUMPED NECK BROKEN BLOODY

He tries to move him and in the process
reveals to his ABSOLUTE

horror KATHARINE STARING GRIMLY AHEAD
UNABLE TO MOVE Hes frantic

ALMASY
Katharine Oh dear God
Katharine -
what are you doing here

KATHARINE
(eyes rolling
an incredible weariness)
I cant move I cant get out

Almasy starts to pull at the wreck around her
DURING THIS -

ALMASY
Why did he bring you

KATHARINE
A surprise he said

Almasy inspects Clifton tries to find a
pulse The smoke circles
around them Katharine looks at her husband

KATHARINE
Poor Geoffrey He knew He
must
have known all the time He
was
shouting - I love you
Katharine

I love you so much Is he
badly hurt
His neck is odd

Almasy puts his arm around Katharine to try
and pull her clear She
cant stand the pain

KATHARINE
Please dont move me It hurts
too much

ALMASY
Weve got to get you out of
here

KATHARINE
It hurts too much

ALMASY
(cant bear to
hurt her)
I know darling Im sorry
The smoke thickens He pulls - hard - the
pain from which causes

Katharine to gasp then pass out They slip
haphazardly to the ground

cushioned a little by the sand He lifts her
gently into his arms and

carries her from the danger of the place then
turns and runs back

THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES Almasy
dashes into the fire

disappearing into the smoke before emerging
with Clifton over his

shoulder firemans-lift style

178 EXT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS DAY

He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF
HER PARACHUTE and emerges

from the near the familiar cleft in the rock
struggling with the

exertion of the climb as they approach the
Cave of Swimmers He has a

large water bottle slung around his neck and a
haversack and is loaded

like a pack horse Katharine opens her eyes

KATHARINE
(whispering)
Why did you hate me

ALMASY
What

KATHARINE
Dont you know you drove
everybody mad

ALMASY
Dont talk

KATHARINE
(gasping)
You speak so many bloody
languages
and you never want to talk

They stagger on He suddenly notices a stain
of gold at her neck

Its saffron leaking from a silver THIMBLE
which hangs from a black

ribbon

ALMASY
(overwhelmed)
Youre wearing the thimble

KATHARINE
Of course You idiot I
always wear it
Ive always worn it Ive
always loved you

Almasy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs no words
- convulsed with the
pain of it They approach the Cave

179 INT CAVE OF SWIMMERS DAY

Almasy comes through in shadows carrying
Katharine blocking out the
light that pours into the entrance of the
cave Once inside he sets
her down incredibly gently makes a bed of
blankets and the parachute
He turns on his flashlight

KATHARINE
Its so cold

ALMASY
I know Im sorry Ill make
a fire
Ill be back
KATHARINE
(panicking
suddenly)

Dont leave me

ALMASY
Im just going to find things
for the fire

179a INT CAVE OF SWIMMERS

Almasy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS

cached As he makes the fire the light sends
his shadow flitting

across the walls

KATHARINE
Shall we be all right

ALMASY
Yes Absolutely

KATHARINE
(with a laugh)
Oh dear

ALMASY
(as he works)
Listen to me Katharine
Youve broken
your ankle and Im going to

wrist might be

broken too - and some ribs
which is

why its hurting you to
breathe Im

Taj Given

all the traffic in the desert
these days

I should bump into one army or
another

before I reach there - or
Fenelon-Barnes

and his camel And then Ill

and well be fine and Ill
never leave you

The fire is lit and he comes over to her
kneels beside her

KATHARINE

Do you promise I wouldnt
want to die

here I wouldnt want to die
in the desert

Ive always had a rather
elaborate funeral

in mind with particular hymns
Very

English And I know exactly
where I

garden Where

I grew up With a view of the

sea So

promise me youll come back for
you

ALMASY

I promise Ill come back I
promise

Ill never leave you And

He kisses her tenderly Pulls out his
HERODOTUS and lays it beside
her Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT

ALMASY
And a good read
(of the
flashlight battery)
Dont waste it
KATHARINE
Thank you
(clouds over)
Will you bury Geoffrey I know
hes dead

ALMASY
Im sorry Katharine

KATHARINE
I know
ALMASY
Every night I cut out my heart
but
in the morning it was full
again

Hes tearing strips from the parachute with
his knife As he starts to

bind her wrist he gets her to talk trying to
distract her from the

pain
ALMASY
Tell me about your garden
KATHARINE
(tries to focus)
Our Garden our garden - not so
much

the garden but the copse
alongside it
wild a secret way plunging
down to the

a

ore and then nothing but
water
between you and France The
Devils
Chimney it was called -

on the binding)

The Devils Chimney I dont

bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner
along the corridor leaving

behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing
case with a rifle across

his lap reading a Penguin edition of
Gullivers Travels Almasy is in

complete despair to be on the train He tries
to move but hes locked

tight to the grille He rattles the cuffs
against the metal

split second Enough for

Almasy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach
winding him then he KICKS

HIM REPEATEDLY in the head He wraps his
cuffs around the Soldiers

neck and - yanking them together and twisting
- produces a tiny

efficient and sickening snap

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs unlocks

over the guard rail and

leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert
sunset

made out of the metal of
ordinary things

I want to make an ordinary
thing

out of guns

His bayonet is thrust into the forge Its
red hot

KIP

When I went to England I was
amazed at

what went on the waste - Id
been taught

to re-use everything the dung
from a cow

to cool a radiator a fork to
fixa

typewriter - India could live
fora

hundred years on what I saw
thrown away

HANA

stops distracted by

something hes listening to on his crystal
set Its new he seems not

Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of
water sending a great hissing

column of steam

195 INT THE PATIENTS ROOM DAY

CARAVAGGIO
You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away doesnt it
Black nights fucking black

nights

dog

I thought I would kill you
You

my

hands But the girl was always
here like some Guardian Angel

THE PATIENT

the Patient and POINTS A
GUN AT HIM Caravaggio is taken by surprise

CARAVAGGIO

brother

always said I was a fool
Never trust the

British he said the deal-
makers the

map-makers never shake hands

with them
THE PATIENT
What are you talking about
KIP

ground

ourselves stuffed in corpses
dropped

out of the sky And now this

intervene

CARAVAGGIO
Kip listen -

Kip sings the rifle at him KNOCKING HIM to
the floor

KIP
I said keep out of this

He pulls of his earphones and rams them around
the Patients head

dropping the set onto the bed The Patient
listens coughing

KIP

celebrating I listened to
you Uncle

Sitting at your feet - always
sitting at

somebodys feet - trying to
learn The

right way to hold a teacup

explained in

terms of a cricket bat and an

accent
CARAVAGGIO
Kip -
KIP
Kip - its not even my name

Hana runs in alerted by the commotion
stunned by what she sees

CARAVAGGIO
Well then ask him his name

HANA
(getting in
between Kip and the Patient)
Whats happened Kip Whats
happening
Dont shoot please dont
shoot anybody

KIP
Theyre excited Theyre happy
about

THE PATIENT
(pulling off the
earphones)

Go on do it I dont need to
hear any more

CARAVAGGIO
Kip listen he lost everything
because
he wasnt English - Jesus -

Im more English than he is

Kip levels the gun at the Patient Then
breaks it open throws it down

on the bed next to the earphones from which

leak some words audible - Eunola Gay
Hiroshima and from

different voices - It was beautiful just
beautiful Bang the

biggest bang you ever saw

horribly cold I really ought
to

drag myself outside but then

She passes the flashlight across the wall the
painted figures dancing
in the pale light

KATHARINE (0S)
Im afraid I waste the light on

the

paintings and on writing these
words

swallowed

in the back and a WOMAN

sits behind the man nursing a two-year-old

CARAVAGGIO
Hana Come on

He gets up into the BALUSTRADE tentatively
finds his balance then

starts to walk heel to toe - slowly and then
with more confidence -

along the long thin line of stone The
children watch intently He

turns and bows

KATHARINE (0S)
bodies we have entered and

swum up
like rivers fears we have
hidden in
like this wretched cave

COLOR OCHRE across her

brow BLUE on her eyelids RED on her lips

names of powerful men

meets the others - Gioias

brother and wife their children She smiles
at them

HANA
Buon giorno

CARAVAGGIO
She can take you as far as
Florence

HANA
I can get in the back

And she clambers up sits down between the
children They exchange

some small stiff shy smiles and then the
truck bounces away Hana

takes one final look at the Monastery as it
disappears around the bend

and then turns and confronts the life
insisting noisily in the truck

210 EXT CAVE OF SWIMMERS DAY

Almasy comes out of the cave carrying the
bundle of Katharine in his

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air

212 INT TIGER MOTH DAY

INSIDE THE COCKPIT THE COUPLE AS AT THE
FRONT OF THE FILM Almasy

obliterated by goggles and helmet Katharine
behind him slumped

forwards as if sleeping

Almasy banks across the plateau of the Gilf
Kebir and glances down In

a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS
He is mesmerized
And then its gone and he passes into the
earth without maps - the

desert - as it stretches out for mile after
mile

KATHARINE (0S)
The lamps gone out and Im
writing
in the darkness

Almasy the English Patient begins to sing -
Szerelem Szerelem —

until that also fades and is replaced by the
womans tender lament

heard at the beginning of the film singing
for all that has been lost

The sound of gun fire
