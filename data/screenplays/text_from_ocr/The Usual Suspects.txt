-BLACK

The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance Water
slapping against a smooth flat surface in rhythm The
creaking of wood

Off in the very far distance one can make out the sound of
sirens

SUDDENLY a single match ignites and invades the darkness It
quivers for a moment A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the
pack to the match A plume of yellow-white flame flares and
illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON age forty His
salty-gray hair is wet and matted His face drips with water
or sweat A large cut runs the length of his face from the
corner of his eye to his chin It bleeds freely An un-lit
cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth

In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a
large boat A yacht perhaps or a small freighter He sits
with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house
His legs are twisted at odd almost impossible angles He
looks down

A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
darkness Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
matches before throwing them into the liquid

The liquid IGNITES with a poof
The flame runs up the stream gaining in speed and intensity
It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
towards the stern

2 EXT BOAT - NIGHT - STERN

A stack of oil drums rests on the stern They are stacked on
a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
crane on the dock One of the barrels has been punctured at

its base Gasoline trickles freely from the hole

The flame is racing now towards the barrels Keaton smiles
weakly to himself

The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
stream of liquid splashes onto the gas The flame fizzles out
pitifully with a hiss

Two feet straddle the flame A stream of urine flows onto the
deck from between them

BLUE 060194

The sound of a fly zipping Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house

CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other It is gold with a clasp that folds down over
the flint The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger It is a fluid motion

somewhat showy

Keaton looks up at the man A look of realization crosses his
face It is followed by frustration anger and finally
resignation

VOICE (0S)
How are you Keaton

KEATON
Id have to say my spine was broken
Keyser

He spits the name out like it was poison

The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket He produces a stainless 38 revolver
VOICE (0S)
Ready

KEATON
What time is it

The hand with the gun turns over turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward
The sound of sirens is closer now Headed this way

VOICE (0S)
Twelve thirty

Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods He turns his head away and
takes another drag

The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy
his last drag before pulling the trigger

GUNSHOT
The sound of Keatons body slumping onto the deck

YELLOW 061194

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely

The sound of the gasoline igniting The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK away from the boat

The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce fire-fight

A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW

On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon
beneath its base

MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS

Sirens are close now Almost here The sound of fire raging
out of control
SIRENS BLARING TIRES SQUEALING CAR DOORS OPENING FEET
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT

MOVE FURTHER SLOWER INTO THE DARKNESS

Voices yelling New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness

SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION
Then silence TOTAL BLACKNESS

We hear the voice of ROGER VERBAL KINT whom we will soon
meet

VERBAL (VO)
New York - six weeks ago A truck loaded
with stripped gun parts got jacked
outside of Queens The driver didnt see
anybody but somebody fucked up He heard
a voice Sometimes thats all you need

3 INT DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO

The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
room Outside the hall is filled with blinding white light
Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room We can make
out men in hoods with flashlights They are laden with
weapons

VOICES
POLICE SEARCH WARRANT DONT MOVE

It is a blur of violent action and soundBeams of
flashlights cut the darkness in all directions

FINALLY

A dozen flashlights land on one man He lies naked in bed
Merging from a deep sleep He squints at the flood of
blinding white light more annoyed than frightened He nearly
laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking He is

INT AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY

An old paint mixer vibrates furiously

on an old Fire-bird

A YOUNG HISPANIC KID mixes paint a few feet away

SUDDENLY the garage door opens TO REVEAL

Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat
from his forehead

HOCKNEY

s EXT STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

FRED FENSTER a tall thin man in his thirties strolls
casually down the street He is dressed conspicuously ina
loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching
He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time

He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb He
picks up his step a little The Ford keeps up

He looks ahead at the corner He tries to look as comfortable
as he can checking his watch as though remembering an
appointment he is late for The Ford stays right on him

SUDDENLY he bolts He gets no more than a few yards before
cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny Brakes
are squealing radios squawking guns cocking Fenster is
surrounded instantly He stops short and flaps his hands on
his thighs in defeat

6 INT MONDINOS RESTAURANT - DAY

An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of
a small New York cafe They are charged with nervous excited
energy

YELLOW 061194

5A

The man is DEAN KEATON a well dressed sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN age thirty-three poised and attractive - Easily
the calmer of the two

BLUE 060194

They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
leading down to a dark room Edie takes Keatons arm and
stops him

EDIE
Let me look at you

Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit or perhaps the
situation Still he smiles with genuine warmth

Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
from his lapel

EDIE (CONTD)
Now remember this is another kind of
business They dont earn your respect
You owe it to them Dont stare them down
but dont look away either Confidence
They are fools not to trust you Thats
the attitude

KEATON
m having a stroke

EDIE
Youve come far Youre a good man I
love you

Keaton blinks then stammers looking for a response
PAUSE
EDIE (CONTD)
Live with it

She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
behind Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
stumbles down the stairs

INT RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS

They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
each other Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
though hit with cold air They assume a cool professional
exterior and walk two feet apart One would look at them and
see only two business associates here to ply their trade

They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
far corner where two men are already waiting The first is

MR FORTIER age thirty-five the other is MR RENAULT age

sixty Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
air They stand and smile

YELLOW 061194
FORTIER
Edie nice to see you

EDIE

Everyone sits at the table All faces are smiling
LOW ANGLE UNDER TABLE

Edies hand reaches out and finds Keatons leg Her hand runs
high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly

Her face is absolutely calm giving no hint of what her hand
is doing Keaton smiles and clears his throat

FORTIER
Edie brought us your proposal and Ill be

honest Were very impressed A bit
skeptical I must admit but impressed

KEATON
Skeptical

RENAULT
We find the concept brilliant but New
York is difficult for new restaurants
How can we be certain that our money will
be returned in the long run

Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently

KEATON

Its simple gentlemen design

versatility A restaurant that can change
with taste without losing the overall

aesthetic Our atmosphere wont be
painted on the walls

FORTIER
This was the part of the proposal that
intrigued us but Im not sure I follow

KEATON
Lets say for example -

VOICE (0S)
This I had to see myself
Keaton looks up He sees David Kujan Behind him are the very
serious looking guys in suits

Keaton is not happy to see them

KEATON

Keaton Better than I would have thought

RENAULT
Is there a problem Mr Keaton

KUJAN
The small matter of a stolen truck-load
of guns that wound up on a boat to
Ireland last night

Renault and Fortiers confusion is giving way to suspicion

FORTIER
Mr Keaton

KEATON
If you will excuse us for a moment
gentlemen

KUJAN

We need to ask you some questions
downtown Youll be quite awhile
Renault starts to get up

RENAULT
We should leave you to discuss whatever
this is

KEATON

Please Sit

Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
cover the check He looks at Edie She moves to stand but he
sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder

KEATON
Enjoy the meal

(To Edie)
ILL call you

Kujan takes him by the arm but Keaton yanks away

YELLOW 061194

He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the
restaurant Everyone is looking at him with some level of
surprise If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair he
hides it well

11 INT LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT

A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
door

FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement
floor The shoes are shabby and worn as are the wrinkled
pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs The right
foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp It
is clear that the knee does not extend fully

The sound of a steel door opening The bottom corner of a
steel cage comes into view Another set of feet falls into
step with the first Another steel door and another set of
feet Another door another and another Five pairs of feet
walk single file down the hall

The lame feet are in the front of the line They come to
another steel door this one solid and covered with dents and
rivets
CRANE UP TO REVEAL

ROGER KINT VERBAL to his few friends He has a deeply lined
face making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best From
his twisted left hand we can see that he suffers from a
slight but not debilitating palsy Behind him are Dean
Keaton Fred Fenster McManus and Todd Hockney

Verbal steps through the door followed by the rest

VERBAL (VO)
It didnt make sense that I be there I
mean these guys were hard-core hijackers

wall painted with horizontal blue stripes Each has a number
at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it
Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the
specific height in inches

McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of

moment Finally McManus turns to the others

McMANUS (CONTD)

(Whispering)
Now I cant talk about this here in any
detail but listen up

Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManuss cell as he
begins to speak in low hushed tones

VERBAL (VO)
And that was how it began The five of us
brought in on a trumped-up charge to be
leaned on by half-wits What the cops
never figured out and what I know now
was that these men would never break
never lie down never bend over for
anybody Anybody

EXT PIER - DAY - SAN PEDRO - PRESENT DAY

It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene
Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock

Police swarm everywhere photographers are taking pictures of
the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
plastic gloves pick at the remains

Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon dousing the
smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull

Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
suit He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the FBI He is tall
and fit in his late thirties He gazes out over the water
thoughtfully

YELLOW 061194

A UNIFORM COP trots up to him

COP
Who are you

Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man

BAER
Agent Jack Baer FBI How many dead

Before the cop can answer Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags

COP
Fifteen so far Were still pulling some
bodies out of the water

Baer eyes the corpses on the dock burned beyond recognition

COP
Looking for anyone in particular

Baer looks at the cop for the first time unamused

BAER
f dont want any of the bodies taken away
until Ive had a chance to go over this
understood

COP
I have to clear the scene Ive got word
direct from the Chief
Baer lights a cigarette only half listening

BAER
(Unimpressed)
Yes the chief Spooky stuff Any
survivors

COP
Two Theres a guy in county hospital
but hes in a coma The DA has the
other guy - A cripple - from New York I
think Listen the Chief said -

BAER
Excuse me

Baer walks away from the cop ignoring him completely He
wanders through the carnage on the pier

A half mile out from the pier

The sea is choppy stirred by the wind An object floats into
view a few feet away bobbing in the water

It is A DEAD BODY - a man face down wearing a CHECKERED
BATHROBE He drifts quietly toward the open ocean

INT HEARING ROOM - DAY - LOS ANGELES PRESENT
Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
to a tape recorder his brow beaded with sweat
On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA
He is cleaner better kept in a well-cut suit and neatly
trimmed hair He looks older than he did in New York - worn

down

to see if the District Attorney manages
to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous
counts of murder against one man with

your job would agree with these alleged
faceless people in City Hall you

mention
VOICE 2 1
One would think the counsel is veiling a
threat
VOICE 1

Counsel isnt veiling anything
VOICE 2
Ill take my chances then Ill feel
safer without a job if a man like Mr

Mr Kint will plead guilty to weapons
possession

22 INT POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

David Kujan is walking quickly beside SERGEANT RABIN a dark
and weathered looking man in his late thirties They move up
a staircase into the heart of police headquarters

KUJAN
What do you mean I cant see him

RAB IN
The DA came down here last night ready
to arraign before they even moved him to
county Kints lawyer comes in and five
minutes later the DA comes out looking
like hed been bitch-slapped by the
boogey man They took his statement and
cut him a deal

KUJAN
Did they charge him with anything

RAB IN
Weapons Misdemeanor two

KUJAN
Whatthe fuck is that

Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice He points out
that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks
where a number of other police are working within earshot

RABIN
I give the DA credit for getting that
much to stick This whole thing has
turned political The Mayor was here -

RABIN

Dave please

Rabins office can only be described as a disaster area The
desk is cluttered with weeks perhaps months or even years of
paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out

Above his desk is a bulletin board It is a breathtaking
catastrophe of papers wanted posters rap-sheets memos and
post-its This is in the neighborhood of decades Rabin is a
man with a system so cryptic so far beyond the comprehension
of others he himself is most likely baffled by it

RABIN (CONTD)
Even if I was to let you talk to him he
wont talk to you Hes paranoid about
being recorded and he knows the
interrogation rooms are wired

KUJAN
This wont be an interrogation just a
friendly chat to kill time

RAB IN
(enunciating)
He wont go into the interrogation room

KUJAN
Someplace else then

RAB IN
Where

Kujan looks around Rabins messy office
RABIN (CONTD)
No no no no no

KUJAN
If it was a dope deal wheres the dope
if it was a hit who called it in

RABIN
And I am sure you have a host of wild

theories to answer these questions

KUJAN
You know damn well what I think

RABIN
Thats crazy Dave and it doesnt matter

Baer comes to an abrupt halt at the foot of a bed surrounded
by a massive tangle of medical equipment In the center of it
all is the as yet unnamed ARKOSH KOVASH mid-thirties His
body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist
to chin

him

He looks closely at his battered and scalded face He listens
to him far a moment Kovash goes on incessantly

KOVASH

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said In

the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect
spouted two words that have gotten Baers attention

he has

He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again

KOVASH

He waves his hand gesturing for Kovash to say it again

KOVASH

see what he is looking at

EDIE

others on the street She reaches over and takes Keaton by
the arm pulling gently She glares at the others

EDIE

Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the

at each other It is a strange moment of unspoken
understanding

Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
screech up on either side of the cruiser boxing it in with
only a few inches between them

The cruiser is surrounded on all sides
SUDDENLY SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows They
come to rest one on Strauszs left temple one on Rizzis

He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
with one hand A stocking is over the drivers head

missing a back window Another man with a stocking on his

head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside

Strauszs badge off of his shirt

Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing
at him through the window On the other end is a masked and
smiling Todd Hockney

three years The guy I know is a cold-
blooded bastard LAPD indicted him on
three counts of murder before he was
icked off the force so dont sell me
the hooker with the heart of gold

VERBAL
You got him wrong

KUJAN
Do I Keaton was under indictment a total
of seven times when he was on the force
In every case witnesses either reversed

their testimony to the grand jury or died

before they could testify When they t
finally did nail him for fraud he spent
five years in Sing Sing He killed three

prisoners inside - one with a knife in

the tailbone while he strangled him to
death Of course I cant prove this but I
cant prove the best part either

Kujan pauses to drink some coffee

KUJAN (CONTD)
Dean Keaton was dead Did you know that xr
He died in a fire two years ago during an
investigation into the murder of a
witness who was going to testify against
him Two people saw Keaton enter a
warehouse he owned just before it went

up They said he had gone in to check a
leaking gas main It blew up and took all

of Dean Keaton with it Within three

months of the explosion the two

witnesses were dead one killed himself

in his car and the other fell down an

All five guys stand in a group It is utterly quiet

An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
far end and idles up to them The windows are tinted too much
to see in The car passes within a few feet of them and
drives on

A moment later a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
Davidson pulls into the lot The rider is dressed in an
almost comical array of leather silver and suede

He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
the others It sits quietly almost menacing

As he gets closer we can see he is wearing one black boot
and one red Keaton is still looking at them when the bike

pulls up to them and stops

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

McManus walks along a line of cars He comes across a black
Mercedes and stops He looks down at the license plate and
walks over to the next car a green Honda He pulls a slim-
jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda He
reaches in and opens the hood He walks around and sticks his
head in the engine

INT VAN

Verbal sits behind the wheel Keaton is beside him Hockney
and Fenster are in the back They all watch McManus from
where they are parked a few dozen yards away

INT PARKING GARAGE

DING-DING

The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage The
doors open Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look
around cautiously The first is TUCCI a big bellied white
haired menace The other is HIGHAM lean and bad skinned
They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful
move

They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside

Out walks SAUL BERG a slightly overweight man in his forties
with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his
hairy chest He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE

He lets his guards do the worrying He walks straight to his
car

Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda He takes out
his keys and pushes a button on his key chain The Mercedes
beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off

Tucci keeps an eye on McManus Higham watches Saul
McManus pretends to tinker with the cars engine He has put
a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach

The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out
of the spot It cruises over toward the Mercedes

Tucci sees the van He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to
keep track They hear laughing behind them and turn around

YELLOW 061194

FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them They are
sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching
suits each with loud plaid sport coats decades out of
style Saul glances at Tucci and Higham

HIGHAM
Just get in the car Saul

Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight McManus pulls
on a black ski mask

The van gets closer

HOCKNEY
I get out of the car and man if the
thing wasnt wrecked And I see this
broad in the back seat with nothing on

Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and
Hockney laugh and talk louder They look drunk - The desired
effect

HOCKNEY (CONTD)
Im laughing so hard I cant breathe -

Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride Sauls reverse
lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot

HOCKNEY (CONTD)
And the fat guy comes out of the car
with his pants on backwards and says -

SUDDENLY the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Sauls
Mercedes blocking him in Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk
act and snap to They both pull out guns and start screaming

HOCKNEY (CONTD)
DONT MOVE YOU FUCKERS

FENSTER
RIGHT THERE FREEZE

McManus comes up from under the hood

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air Hockney and
Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their
guns

Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Sauls car his

face covered in a ski mask He yanks on the door handle but
it is locked Saul sits in terror behind the wheel Keaton

pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it

YELLOW 061194

KEATON
Give me the case

Saul reaches over for the case Keaton trains the gun on him

SUDDENLY Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at
Keaton Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist The gun goes
off into the fender of the Honda

Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun

Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity Tucci grabs Hockney
Higham grabs Fenster The four men grapple for the guns

Fensters gun falls to the floor McManus picks it up He
trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath They
are some ten feet apart and moving erratically Hockney and
Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire

McManus walks around the four men keeping a pistol trained
on each of the guards Finally he comes to an angle where
they are all in front of him One guard is a few feet away
the other is ten feet past him

McMANUS POV
The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the

pistol in McManus right hand the one farther away does the
same with the left
Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help
BOOM

Both of McManus guns go off like one shot Tucci and Higham
collapse each with a bullet in his head

PAUSE

The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun His
arm is halfway out the window His elbow rests in the door
frame

Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand Finally he pushes
down with all his weight Sauls elbow breaks backwards on
the door frame He screams in agony The gun falls from his
hand

BLUE 060194

All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long
moment The confusion is only aggravated by Sauls screaming

SLOWLY Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul His
hand trembles his eyes squint to near slits His finger
tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger

BOOM

trembles more than he does

recognize Mr Fenster from his mug shot
as well as Mr McManus

(To Verbal)
I can only assume that you are Mr Kint
I believe you were the one who disposed
of Saul My employer sends his gratitude
A most unexpected benefit

this

dont expect all of you to live but
those who do will have ninety-one million

Whos your boss

KOBAYASHI
My employer wishes to remain anonymous

KEATON
Dont jerk me off We all know what this
is You dont work with me if I work with
you without knowing who Im working for
Now lets cut the shit Whos the man

KOBAYASHI
I work for Keyser Sate

A strange look crosses Keatons face Skepticism mockery and
just a hint of fear Hockney McManus and Fenster all share
similar looks
KEATON
What is this

VERBAL
Whos Keyser Soze

KOBAYASHI
I am sure youve heard a number of tall
tales myths and legends about Mr Soze
I can assure you gentlemen most of them
are true

VERBAL
Whos Keyser Soze

KOBAYASHI
Judging by the sudden change in mood I
am sure the rest of your associates can
tell you Mr Kint I have come with an
offer directly from Mr Soze An order
actually

KEATON
An order

BLUE 060194

KOBAYASHI
In nineteen-eighty one Mr Keaton you
participated in the hijacking of a truck
in Buffalo New York The cargo was raw
steel Steel that belonged to Mr Soze
and was destined for Pakistan to be used
in a Nuclear reactor A very profitable
violation of UN Regulations You had no
way of knowing this because the man
shipping the steel was working for Mr
Sate without his knowledge

(Beat)

Mr Fenster and Mr McManus hijacked a
twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year
out of Newark airport The plane was
carrying platinum and gold wiring Also
set for Pakistan

Kobayashi turns and points at Hockney

KOBAYASHI (CONTD)
Two months ago Mr Hockney stole a truck
carrying gun parts through Queens -

Everyone looks at Hockney He smiles shyly

It occurs to them

all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested

in the first place

KOBAYASHI (CONTD)
- guns allegedly set to be destroyed by
the state of New York They were to be
lost in a weigh station and routed to
Belfast Again Mr Sate using pawns who
had no knowledge

(turning to Verbal)
Which brings us to Mr Kint

Verbal crumbles under his stare

KOBAYASHI (CONTD)
Nine months ago one of Mr Soze less
than intelligent couriers was taken ina
complicated confidence seam by a cripple
He was relieved of sixty-two thousand
dollars Now

(To all of them)

- It has taken us some time to find you
Our intention was to approach you after
your apprehension in New York

BLUE 060194

KEATON
You set up the line-up

KOBAYASHI
Mr Soze made a few calls yes You were
not to be released until I came to see
you It seems Mr Keatons attorney Ms
Finneran was a bit too effective in
expediting his release Holding the rest
of you became a moot point

KEATON
What about Redfoot

KOBAYASHI
Mr Redfoot knew nothing Mr Soze rarely
works with the same people for very long
and they never know who theyre working
for One cannot be betrayed if one has no
people

FENSTER
So why tell us

KOBAYASHI
Because you have stolen from Mr Soze
That you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive
but he feels you owe him You will repay
your debt

HOCKNEY
Who is this guy How do we know you work
for Soze

KOBAYASHI
I dont think that is relevant Mr
Hockney The five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg and his
bodyguards Mr Redfoot can attest to
your involvement and we can see to it
that he will He is not of your
superior breed

MCMANUS
This is a load of shit

KOBAYASHI

The offer is this gentlemen Mr Sozes
primary interest as I am sure you all
know is narcotics Hes been - competing
shall we say with a group of

YELLOW 061194

KOBAYASHI (contd)
Argentinians for several years Competing
with Mr Soze has taken its toll These
Argentinians are negotiating the sale of
ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in
three days time Needless to say this
purchase will revitalize the diminishing
strength of their organization Mr Soze
wants you to stop the deal If you
choose you may wait until the buy
Whatever money changes hands is yours
The transaction will take place on a boat
in San Pedro Mr Soze wants you to get
to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
board Then you are free of your
obligation to Mr Soze

KEATON
Give me one good reason why I shouldnt
kill you right now

Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front
of him

KOBAYASHI
A gift from Mr Soze gentlemen

He turns and walks out of the room

eaton walks over to the case and opens it He reaches in and
pulls out five thick manila envelopes each marked in bold

his father was German Nobody believed he
was real Nobody ever saw him or knew
anybody that ever worked directly for
him but to hear Kobayashi tell it
anybody could have worked for Soze You
never knew That was his power The
greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was
convincing the world he didnt exist One
story the guys told me - the story I
believe - was from his days in Turkey
There was a petty gang of Hungarians that
wanted their own mob They realized that
to be in power you didnt need guns or
money or even numbers You just needed

the will to do what the other guy
wouldnt After a while they come to

wait for Sate
68 INT SOZES HOME - LATER

68
The front door opens and in walks Keyser Sate We are never
allowed to see his face

Sates wife lies in the corner beaten and bruised Her dress
is tattered to shreds She cannot look up at her husband

The three Hungarians stand to greet him Two hold guns in
their hands The third holds a straight razor He grabs
Soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat

VERBAL (VO)
He comes home to his wife raped and his
children screaming The Hungarians knew
Soze was tough Not to be trifled with
So they let him know they meant business

The Hungarian smiles Sozes wife SCREAMS IN HORROR
The Hungarian holds up a BLOOD SOAKED RAZOR
SUDDENLY he grabs another child A little girl no older than
six
VERBAL (VO)
They tell Soze they want his territory -

all his business Soze looks over the

faces of his family Then he showed
these men of will what will really was

SUDDENLY Soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with
guns He turns and aims at the third man holding his child

The man threatens to cut the childs throat slicing just
enough to draw blood

SOZE FIRES

The stunned Hungarian watches the child fall from his arms
Sate turns the pistol on the next child then the next and
the next He kills his children one by one in front of the

Hungarian

PINK 060794

VERBAL (VO)
He tells him he would rather see his
family dead than live another day after
this

SOZE walks over to his wife crying and beaten on the floor
and holds up her head She gives him the strangest look One
of trust perhaps saturated with fear and humiliation

He puts the gun between her eyes and fires

VERBAL (VO)
He lets the last Hungarian go and he
goes running He waits until his wife and
ids are in the ground and he goes after
the rest of the mob He kills their kids
he kills their wives he kills their
parents and their parents friends

A dark and looming figure of a man walks in front of a wall
of fire - a black shadow blurred by waves of heat

VERBAL (VO)
He burns down the houses they live in and
the stores they work in he kills people
that owe them money And like that he was
gone Underground No one has ever seen
him again He becomes a myth a spook
story that criminals tell their kids at
night If you rat on your pop Keyser
Sate will get you And nobody really ever
believes

Jaime squints and cocks his head

YELLOW 061194

SOMEONE IS COMING He raises a pistol and crouches by the
door

INT CABIN

The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching
the door He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too
far away

He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the
bulkhead Only the top of his head is visible He starts to
cry

BOOM - BOOM - Two shots just outside in the hall

SUDDENLY the door bursts open Jaime collapses in a heap on

the floor a bullet hole in his eye
A FIGURE LOOMS IN THE DOOR

The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure We cannot see
him

MAN IN ROBE
I told them nothing

BOOM

The man in the robe falls dead

EXT DECK - MOMENTS LATER

The boat is quiet now Keaton walks out onto the deck

He looks out over the pier and sees Verbal standing in the
middle of the carnage frozen Their eyes meet Keaton waves

at him as if to shoe him away

EXT PIER - TOP OF RAMP
Verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the
money He looks back over his shoulder and sees Keaton

Keaton sees him looking and waves again hurrying him along

Verbal turns away and focuses on the van

EXT DECK

Keaton hears a noise behind him He swings around and points
his gun at McManus again He puts the gun down

YELLOW 061194

McManus smiles He walks slowly across the deck towards
Keaton Something is not right about him

McMANUS
Strangest thing

He slumps to the deck Keaton rushes over to him He kneels
down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManuss

neck

EXT PIER

Verbal approaches the van stepping over Hockneys body He
closes the back doors of the van 1

He looks to his left at the huge loading crane He glances
upward along the giant arm as it swings steadily on

Somewhere off in the distance the sound of SIRENS can be
heard

EXT DECK

Keaton kneels by McManus trembling with rage After a moment
he stands looking down at McManus dead body

EXT PIER

SUDDENLY Verbal realizes something He turns and goes to
call out a warning to Keaton He is too late

EXT DECK

Keaton never sees the crane coming
WHAM

The pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends
him flying into the wheel house of the boat

Keaton is still for a moment Finally he tries to get up
but finds he cannot move his legs

EXT PIER

Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can He comes to a
rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat

SUDDENLY he stops dead in his tracks looking up at the
boat

From where he stands he can just make out the figure of a

TAU

THIN MAN walking along the edge of the deck He moves

quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane looking
out of place in his expensive suit

Kujan picks up his copy of Verbals statement to the DA

A man in a suit with a slim build Tall

VERBAL
Wait a minute

KUJAN
(Looking at watch)
I dont have a minute Are you saying it

Verbal is drowning in Kujans interrogation He looks dazed
VERBAL
I - there had to be dope there

You know what Im getting at

VERBAL
I dont
KUJAN
YES YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT IM GETTING AT
THE TRUTH TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDNT

KEATON

For the first time Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan but Kujan stays in his face backing him into a
corner Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his

eyes

KUJAN (CONTD)
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW I KNOW
EVERYTHING

VERBAL
I dont know what youre talking about

KUJAN
YOU KNOW YOUVE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING
TIME GIVE IT TO ME

Verbal looks into Kujans eyes with genuine terror Kujans
face is red his body trembles His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room

VERBAL
I dont understand what youre saying I
saw Keaton get shot I swear to you

KUJAN
Then why didnt you help him

VERBAL
I WAS AFRAID OKAY Somehow I was sure
it was Keyser Soze at that point I
couldnt bring myself to raise my gun to
him

KUJAN
But Keaton

VERBAL
It was Keyser Soze Agent Kujan I mean
the Devil himself How do you shoot the
Devil in the back

YELLOW 061194

Verbal holds up a shaking twisted hand
VERBAL (CONTD)
What if you miss

140 EXT BARGE - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR

Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
barge

VERBALS POV

Keatons body is completely obscured

The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton
stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck

He walks up and stands over Keaton The two men exchange
words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol He points
it at Keaton

RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL

Verbal turns He can just make out police cars coming in the
distance

BANG

Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat He turns in
time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
toward the gangway

Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now The man
in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
barge Verbal strains to see but he cannot

The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter
He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight

A moment later flames leap up from on the deck

The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
its base

MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS

Sirens are close now Almost here The sound of fire raging
out of control

141 INT RABINS OFFICE - DAY - PRESENT

KUJAN
Arturo Marquez Ever hear of him

VERBAL
Wha- No

KUJAN
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
Department He swore out a statement to
Federal Marshals that he had seen and
could positively identify one Keyser Soze
and had intimate knowledge of his
business including but not exclusive
to drug trafficking and murder

VERBAL
I never heard of him

KUJAN
His own people were selling him to a gang
of Hungarians Most likely the same
Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
back in Turkey The money wasnt there
for dope The Hungarians were going to
buy the one guy that could finger Soze
for them

VERBAL
I said I never heard of him

KUJAN
But Keaton had Edie Finneran was his
extradition advisor She knew who he was
and what he knew

VERBAL
I dont

KUJAN
There were no drugs on that boat It was
a hit A suicide mission to whack out the
one man that could finger Keyser Soze so
Sate had a few thieves put to it Men he
knew he could march into certain death
VERBAL
But how - wait Youre saying SOZE sent

us to kill someone

BLUE 060194

KUJAN
Im saying Keaton did

Verbal cannot grasp this He squints trying to understand

KUJAN (CONTD)
Verbal he left you behind for a reason
If you all knew Soze could find you
anywhere why was he ready to send you
off with the money when he could have
used you to take the boat

VERBAL
He wanted me to live

KUJAN
Why did he want you to live A one-time
dirty cop without a loyalty in the world
finds it in his heart to save a worthless
rat-cripple No sir Why

VERBAL
Edie

KUJAN
I dont buy that reform story for a
minute And even if I did I certainly
dont believe he would send you to
protect her So why

VERBAL
Because he was my friend

KUJAN
No Verbal You werent friends Keaton
didnt have friends He saved you because
he wanted it that way It was his will

Verbal grinds to a mental halt trying to grasp the
implication

SUDDENLY
VERBAL
No

KUJAN
Keaton was Keyser Soze

VERBAL
NO

SCRIPT DATE 52594

KUJAN
The kind of guy who could wrangle the
wills of men like Hockney and McManus
The kind of man who could engineer a
police line-up from all his years of
contacts in NYPD

Verbal stands on wobbly legs shaking with anger

VERBAL
NO NO NO NO NO

KUJAN
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED
EDIE FINNERAN

A strange look crosses Verbals face Shock perhaps or
revelation

KUJAN (CONTD)
They found her yesterday in a hotel in
Pennsylvania Shot twice in the head

It starts to sink in with Verbal His eyes swell

VERBAL
Edie

KUJAN
He used all of you to get him on that
boat He couldnt get on alone and he had
to pull the trigger himself to make sure
he got his man The one man that could
identify him

VERBAL
This is all bullshit
KUJAN
He left you to stay behind and tell us he
was dead You saw him die right Or did
you You had to hide when the first
police cars showed up You heard the
shot just before the fire but you didnt
see him die

VERBAL
I knew him He would never -

KUJAN
He programmed you to tell us just what he
wanted you to Customs has been

SCRIPT DATE 52594

KUJAN (contd)
investigating him for years He knew we
were close You said it yourself Where
is the political pressure coming from
Why are you being protected Its Keaton
making sure you tell us what youre
supposed to Immunity is your reward

VERBAL
BUT WHY ME WHY NOT HOCKNEY OR FENSTER OR
McMANUS Im a cripple Im stupid Why
me

Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his
chair Kujan looks at him with some pity but he is too far

in to stop

KUJAN
Because youre a cripple Verbal Because
youre stupid Because you were weaker
than them Because you couldnt see far
enough into him to know the truth

Verbal is crying now He shakes his head eyes closed

KUJAN (CONTD)
If hes dead Verbal - if what you say is
true then it wont matter It was his
idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York
wasnt it Tell me the truth
VERBAL
(Sobbing)
It was all Keaton We followed him from
the beginning

Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction

VERBAL (CONTD)
I didnt know I saw him die I believe
hes dead Christ

KUJAN
Why lie about everything else then

VERBAL
You know what its like Agent Kujan to
know youll never be good Not good like
you You got good all fucked around I
mean a stand up guy I grew up knowing I
was never going to be good at anything
cause I was a cripple Shit I wasnt

BLUE 060194

VERBAL (contd)

even a good thief But I thought the one
thing I could be good at was a keeping my
mouth shut - keeping the code I didnt
want to tell you for my dignity thats
all and you robbed me Agent Kujan You
robbed me

Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it
on the desk Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh but
only briefly overcome by an apparent wave of nausea

KUJAN
Youre not safe on your own

VERBAL
You think hes

KUJAN
Is he Keyser Soze I dont know Verbal
It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a
shield Like you said a spook story but
I know Keaton - and someone out there is
pulling strings for you Stay here and
let us protect you

VERBAL
m not bait No way I post today

KUJAN

You posted twenty minutes ago Captain
Leo wants you out of here asap
unless you turn states

VERBAL
11 take my chances thank you Its
tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than
it is to buy a cop

KUJAN
Where are you going to go Verbal You
gonna run Turn states evidence You
might never see trial If somebody wants
to get you you know Theyll get you out
there

VERBAL
Maybe so but Im no rat Agent Kujan
You tricked me thats all I wont keep
my mouth shut cause Im scared Ill
keep it shut cause I let Keaton down by
getting caught - Edie Finneran too And
if they kill me its

YELLOW 061194

VERBAL (contd)
because Theyll hear I dropped dime
Theyll probably hear it from you

Verbal stands mustering his shattered dignity and walks
towards the door Rabin opens it for him from outside

For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal
Verbal turns to the door stopping to look Rabin in the eye
VERBAL (CONTD)

Fuckin cops

He steps out of the room and into the hall Rabin follows
him

142 INT HOSPITAL - DAY

Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovashs room with a
single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand He inspects the
sketch with great interest He folds the edges of the paper
back to make it smaller

INT HOSPITAL RECEPTION ROOM

Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the
nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine

INT DEPOT - LATER

Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station
picking up his personal belongings

A FAT WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes
them out of the tray in which they are kept

COP
One watch gold One cigarette lighter
gold One wallet brown One pack of
cigarettes

Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame
leg toward the exit

next to a digital display

The display reads RECEIVING

Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board drinking from
Rabins coffee cup Rabin sits at the desk sifting through
the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them
once and for all

RAB IN
You still dont know shit

KUJAN
I know what I wanted to know about
Keaton

RAB IN
Which is shit

KUJAN
No matter Hell have to know how close

A rumor is not a rumor that doesnt die

RAB IN

KUJAN
Nothing Something I - forget it

Kujan shakes his head He gestures to the desk

KUJAN (CONTD)
Man youre a fucking slob

Rabin regards the mess of his office

RAB IN
Yeah Its got its own system though It
all makes sense when you look at it
right You just have to step back from

BLUE 060194

RABIN (contd)
it you know You should see my garage
now thats a horror show

Kujan is not listening He has been staring at the bulletin
board lost in thought his unfocused eyes drifting across

the mess of papers not looking at anything at all

EXT STREET

Verbal steps out into the sunlight putting on a pair of
cheap sunglasses He looks up and down the crowded street
People on their way to and from lunch no doubt

Cars choke the street in front of the police department as
they wait for pedestrians to clear the way

INT DISPATCHERS OFFICE
A single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine face
down

INT RABINS OFFICE

Kujan still stares at the bulletin board

SUDDENLY Kujans face changes He leans in closer to the
bulletin board and squints his eyes His face changes again

First a look of puzzlement then confusion - finally
realization

The coffee cup tumbles from his hand It hits the floor with
the SMASH of cheap porcelain Coffee splatters everywhere

Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise
KUJANS POV

ujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board but at
the bulletin board itself

His eyes follow the aluminum frame mounted firmly to the
wall One might note its sturdy construction and its
convenient size Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
and disregarded notes and facts Years of police trivia that
has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
use for it all someday One might want such a bulletin board
for ones self One would look to see who makes such a
bulletin board

ujans eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
manufacturers name

YELLOW 061194

It reads QUARTET - SKOKIE ILLINOIS

Kujans eyes flash all over the bulletin board He finds a
picture of Rabin in the far corner He stands beside a scale
in fishing gear He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
caught marlin His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN Kujan glazes over his name it
is irrelevant His aliases stand out

Slavin BRICKS Shank REDFOOT Thee Rooster

KUJANS EYES WIDEN with sudden realization He runs for the
door

His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabins coffee cup The
cup that hovered over Verbals head for two hours

Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
cheap mug

KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN

EXT HALLWAY

Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs

EXT STREET

Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just
inside the doorway lighting a cigarette The cop notices
Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people
they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen or stupid
criminal

Verbal smiles politely meekly at the cop and walks down the
steps into the moving throng

INT DEPOT

Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments
before picked up his belongings Rabin is right behind him a
look of absolute confusion on his face

Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk avoiding
people as best as he can

He looks over his shoulder getting farther away from the
police station He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps
looking around with strange lost expressions on their faces

He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
him

155 INT CAR

The drivers hands tap the wheel patiently His eyes follow

Kujan pushes and shoves looking this way and that

LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens of people
Verbals feet emerge from the crowd on the far side They
hobble along the curb

SUDDENLY the right foot seems to relax a little the inward
angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp
ceases as though the leg has grown another inch

CRANE UP VERBALS BODY

Verbals hands are rummaging around in his pockets The good
left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes the bad right
hand comes up with a lighter The right hand flexes with all

Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself He turns

sees the car running alongside

INT DISPATCHERS OFFICE

Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns
over revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE

Though crude and distorted one cannot help but notice how
much it leaks like VERBAL KINT

EXT STREET

The car stops The driver gets out
IT IS KOBAYASHI or the man we have come to know as such

smiles to Verbal Verbal steps off of the curb returning
smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in

The man called Kobayashi gets in the drivers seat and
away

A moment later Agent David Kujan of US Customs wanders
into the frame looking around much in the way a child
when lost at the circus He takes no notice of the car

pulling out into traffic blending in with the rest of the
cars filled with people on their way back to work
