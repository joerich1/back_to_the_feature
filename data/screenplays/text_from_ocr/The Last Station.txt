Based on the novel by

All happy families are the same Each unhappy family is
unhappy in its own way

Leo Tolstoy- Anna Karenina

EXT COUNTRYSIDE DAY

High angle of the steam train travelling through a wide
river valley The stack belching smoke against the Russian
sky

INT SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE COUNTRY SIDE DAY

Leo Tolstoy sits writing on his lapboard He is quite
simply the greatest living writer in the world His
devotion to pacifism his rejection of the trappings of
Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince
many to regard him as a living saint With him are his much
younger wife the COUNTESS SOFYA favorite daughter SASHA
and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY Sasha and
Dushan write in their diaries Sofya looks from one to the
next a little impatient The train begins to slow

SOFYA
Why are we slowing down

No one responds Slower Slower
SOFYA

Were stopping Why are we
stopping
SASHA
I dont know mother No idea

Tolstoy look up from his work asks a passing conductor

SOFYA
Excuse me why has the train
stopped

CONDUCTOR

Its the crowd mam the people
Theyre blocking the track

In the distance we can here voices

VOICES (0S)
Long live Tolstoy Long live the
old warrior

SOFYA
But if they block the track the
train cant goYOU HAVE TO MAKE
THEM MOVE

The conductor shrugs walks away She goes to the window to
investigate A crowd of a hundred peasants students
surround the engine block the track They carry a huge
cloth banner honoring Tolstoy We can hear voices chanting
Tolstoy Tolstoy Tolstoy voices crying You are the
truth You are the hope of the Russian people

SOFYA
Oh they wont move We are
gonna die here Leo Leo go and
say something to them Its the
only way we are gonna get out of
here

The chanting grows in intensity Tolstoy gets to his feet
walks to the window shows himself to the crowd A great
shout goes up Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence
Gradually it comes

TOLSTOY
I have seen your banner And I’ve
heard what you say You think I’m
the hope of Russia do you Well
that’s not true You are the hope
of Russia The hope of all the
world You say you want a new
way to live Well you are not
gonna find it making a fuss over
me So I suggest that you get on
with your work and let a poor old
men get on with his

The cries begin Clear the tracks Let them pass Let them
go Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the
train pulls away

EXT COUNTRYSIDE DAY

On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away We
focus on a handsome young man a little stiff maybe a
little intellectual This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH
BULGAKOV He cant contain his enthusiasm Over the noise
of the train

VALENTIN
Do you know who that is That is
the greatest man in the world

The train pulls away into the distance

TITLE OVER BLACK SPRING 1910

EXT YASNAYA POLYANA DAWN

The ancestral home of the Tolstoy family in the first
budding of spring

Muzhiks (peasants) gather wood carry water to the house A
cart arrives loaded down with mail bags

INT YASNAYA POLYANA SOFYAS BEDROOM DAY

A handsome room walls covered with generations of family
photographs Religious icons are given pride of place a
testament not to piety but to an ingrained social
conservatism a certain position in the world

Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make
shift altar Wiping away tears she leaves the room

INT YASNAYA POLYANA ENTRYSTAIR DAY

Sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an
old servant asleep in a chair She continues to the
basement

INT YASNAYA POLYANA TOLSTOYS BEDROOMSTUDY DAY

Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors
into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and
study The walls are bare except for a portrait of his
daughter The furniture is simple some of it hand made a
small bed against the wall a little writing desk in one
corner stacked with books littered with papers more mail
opened and unopened Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a
work bench

Tolstoy sleeps in his bed Though its late March and
still cold the window is open Sofya closes it She
stands very still watching Tolstoy sleep Sitting on the
bed she gently touches his hand whispers

SOFYA
Darling

She lies next to him something girlish hopeful in her
face as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her but
he sleeps on She carefully takes his arm positions it
under her neck and rolling toward him wraps it around
her The image of loves intimacy of wedded bliss

His hand slips off her shoulder once twice She moves
awkwardly to replace it He moves a little toward her She
kisses his neck his cheek We dont know if hes awake
but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul

INT MOSCOW STUDY DAY

A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR
GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV Tolstoys most articulate and
dedicated disciple Hes interviewing Tolstoys newly
appointed secretary VALENTIN BULGAKOV the young man we
met near the train who at the mention of sex blushes a
little
CHERTKOV

But sex You are twenty three
Not an easy age for abstinence
is it

VALENTIN

Tolstoy does not approve of
sexual relations I know this

CHERTKOV
He despises them in fact

Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax

CHERTKOV
I dont want to belabor the
point but I arranged for a
manservant last year who
proceeded to ruin two housemaids
just like that He was very
upset

VALENTIN
This would not be a problem Im
celibate Im also a strict
vegetarian

Chertkov nods his approval begins to worry his moustache

CHERTKOV
Yes Ive heard many good things
about you Ive even read what
youve written So has he

Valentins face flushes with pride Chertkov steals a
glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase One side of
his moustache droops a little He tugs awkwardly at it

CHERTKOV
My dear boy if you were to
become Tolstoys private
secretary you would be given a
great gift Youll be with him
every day eat together walk in
the forest by his side

Its difficult to contain himself

VALENTIN
Believe me since becoming a
Tolstoyan I have become so eager
to learn so comitted to
discussing ideas improving my
very soul

CHERTKOV
(smiling)
Well we have a lot to do if we
are to get his work to the

people
VALENTIN
We
They both laugh
CHERTKOV

Yes we If we can encourage the
spread of passive
resistancejust think of it
Valentin thousands of ordinary
Russians casting off centuries of
spiritual and political
oppression-

VALENTIN
In the name of truth and freedom

CHERTKOV
Truth and freedom yes but still
my boy there are so many enemies-

VALENTIN
Enemies

Chertkov walks to the window signals Valentin to follow
him He points to

TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below

CHERTKOV

The Czars policeYoull be
followed when you leave
hereand the church will stop
at nothing to bring him back into
the fold His children cant be

trusted only Sasha and then
of course there is the
Countess

(beat)

Well one doesnt like to come
between married people whatever
the circumstances but her dogged
attachment to private property
her public criticism of our
movement

(MORE)

CHERTKOV (contd)
(beat)
The point is he needs a man of
your intellectual gifts around
him Someone who can help him
with the new work Someone who
understands his goals

Chertkov returns to the desk

CHERTKOV
And although theyve allowed me
to return to Russia I cant see
him They keep me under house
arrest They might as well keep
me in a cage

Clearly upset Chertkov pauses to get control of himself
He picks up a package hands it to Valentin

CHERTKOV
So I need you to put these
letters directly into his hands
One cant be sure what gets
through to him

Valentin looks at him quizzical

CHERTKOV
Sofya Andreyevna does not respect
his privacy

VALENTIN
She wouldnt open his private
correspondence

Chertkov raises an eyebrow An ominous silence
CHERTKOV
I have another task for you my

dear

VALENTIN
Please

CHERTKOV
Youll keep a diary for me

He hands Valentin a notebook

CHERTKOV

I need to know everything that
goes on at Yasnaya Polyana Let
me know who visits the house any
talk of the copyright to his
work any contact with the
church what letters come and go

(beat)
Anything Sofya Andreyevna says

VALENTIN
Anything

CHERTKOV
Shes very very dangerous

EXT MOSCOW DOORWAYSTREET EVENING

Chertkov kisses Valentin delicately on both cheeks and
ushers him into the dying light

CHERTKOV
Godspeed my boy

Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him

CHERTKOV
And remember what I said

He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway
CHERTKOV

and international dailies

SOFYA
This is impossible

It really is

These people are parasites

Look
(reading)

Countess Tolstoy has become
estranged from her husband They

barely speak

She throws the paper on the floor

SOFYA

You know who spreads all this

rubbish

She opens another paper a French daily

SOFYA
Cest la meme en France They
gossip about us in Paris They

do not share a similar view of
either religion or politics
Incroyable

TOLSTOY
(smiling)
Peut-etre You think thats
inaccurate

SOFYA
I think its none of the worlds
business

She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his
diary He does it with all the masters conversations

SOFYA
What are you doing Dont do
that

TOLSTOY
(smiling)
Dushan Petrovich youre
scribbling again

Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door

SOFYA
Darling where are you going

TOLSTOY
Riding with Sasha Dont expect
us for lunch

Something strikes him He walks to his desk picks up his
pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper

SOFYA
Leovochka why do you insist on
dressing like that

TOLSTOY

What do you mean

SOFYA
Like the man who looks after the
sheep

TOLSTOY

Its not meant to offend you

SOFYA
But it does offend me because it
offends reason Youre a Count
for Gods sake

He puts his pen down goes to her kisses her gently on the
forehead and leaves the room

SOFYA
Oh darling I have something else
to say

TOLSTOY (0S)
I doubt it not my dear

DUSHAN
Hes forgotten his coat

He runs after him tripping over the long fur garment

DUSHAN (0S)
Count Tolstoy youve forgotten
your coat

Meanwhile Sofya notices a photographic portrait of Chertkov

on the wall She takes it down and tosses it in the
corner

EXT YASNAYA POLYANA GROUNDS DAY
As Tolstoy appears on the porch we hear the WHIR of
cameras A crowd of photographers film cameramen
journalists and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the
master Dushan steps in front of him

DUSHAN

Let him walk Let him walk

JOURNALIST

Count Tolstoy youre no doubt
distressed by the Czars
treatment of your secretary
Nikolai Gusev

TOLSTOY
These people are bandits

DUSHAN
I said let him walk

TOLSTOY
They come into my house and
arrest a man whose only crime is
to express a view of life saner
than that which prevails

JOURNALIST
So Gusev is innocent

TOLSTOY
(nods)
Of course Im the guilty one I
reject the Orthodox church I
condemn the established order and
I make no secret of it

A young peasant shouts from the crowd

PEASANT
God bless you Tolstoy Thank
you

DUSHAN

Let him walk Let him wal
(to Tolstoy)

But you dont banish these people
very much to your creditI wish
I had your largeness of spirit

A photographers flash goes off An old Muzhik touches
Tolstoys sleeve as if expecting a miracle

Sasha her fathers soulmate leads two horses toward them
her mount and her fathers black gelding Delire

the bench across a young mother taking out her breast to
nurse her baby He blushes doesnt know where to look An
old peasant catches his eye winks at him laughs

EXT TELYATINKI DUSK

Seven miles from Tolstoys estate this is Telyatinki a
communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study
and practice of Tolstoyism

SERGEYENKO
Telyatinki was created by
Vladimir Grigorevich as a center
for the movement Just last week

talked to the group about the
healing properties of cobra
venum

VALENTIN
Oh goodnessIts a beautiful
day

SERGEYENKO
Yes but we will pay for it

Sergeyenko Chertkovs joyless secretary and Valentin

central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the
garden work to put up a chicken coop

SERGEYENKO
You understand we must keep the
existence of the diary a secret

Valentin smiles

SERGEYENKO

thought

SERGEYENKO
But youll admit youre no

through the house He points upstairs and walks away

INT YASNAYA POLYANA LIBRARY DAY

Alone now among Tolstoys books Valentin makes his way
slowly to a writing table the holy of holies on which War
and Peace and Anna Karenina were written He runs his hand
along the old wood top Emboldened by a backward glance he
sits in Tolstoys chair Before him are stacks of letters
pens and pencils a pot of India ink Theres a notebook
lying open He leans forward to read it A noise in the
hall stops him

Tolstoy enters from the dining room red cheeked beard
dripping wet the energy of a man ten years younger than he
is Valentin stands

TOLSTOY
Im glad youre here So glad

He tromps across the room kisses the boy enthusiastically
on both cheeks Valentin is overcome by the great mans
warmth

VALENTIN
Im Im Here is-

Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze

TOLSTOY
God bless you

VALENTIN
Im sorry Sometimes I

Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction Tolstoy takes
it out and puts it down without a glance

TOLSTOY
Vladimir Grigorevich has already
written about you at length I
need your help badly The
manifesto against the government
is hard work They commit their
idiotic abuses faster than I can
catalogue themand the new

book
VALENTIN
He told me about itIts very
exciting
Tolstoy nods
TOLSTOY

Ive become convinced that all
the worlds religions have a
single organizing principle Can
you guess what it is Love
Love Simple Now I want to
talk about you How are you How

Tolstoy sits on the old sofa Valentin follows suit

TOLSTOY

EXT YASNAYA POLYANA GROUNDS DAY

Sofya Sasha Valentin ANDREY Tolstoys son and Tolstoy
all clustered around a table taking tea Dushan stands near
the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small
table

SOFYA
These people have nothing

Absolutely

A pause

DUSHAN
It really is the most
extraordinary thing

ignoring him

SOFYA
Its not for lack of land that
the muzhiks live in poverty
They have no will power and they
drink too much

TOLSTOY
Im not suggesting they be given
land Private property is the
root of the problem We should
be giving ours away

ANDREY
Give it to whom

SOFYA
Its all ridiculous You think
that poverty makes the peasants
somehow morally superior

TOLSTOY
I believe that wealth corrupts us
all yes I do

Valentin fills the silence

VALENTIN
Its a keystone of the movement

SOFYA
Oh I know all about the
movement

A pause Valentin notices that people from the front lawn

have moved

up to watch all this Life in the fishbowl

Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care

TOLSTOY
If the peasants had money they
wouldnt surround themselves as
we do with footmen costing ten
rubles a month

SOFYA
No theyd spend it on drink and

the
whores

TOLSTOY
Valentin Fedorovich do you think
fifty years from now people will
eat while grown men walk around
and wait on them hand and foot

Valentin doesnt know what to say A giggle from Dushan

DUSHAN
Oh thats goodthats good

Dushan having sat at table tries surreptitiously to get
down Tolstoys words in the diary he holds below the table
Sofya flushes with anger

VALENTIN
I think (sneeze)

SOFYA
Stop scribbling
(points to her husband)
You all think hes Christ dont
you He thinks hes Christ

There is an awkward pause

DUSHAN
(flustered)
Im notI dont believe Leo
Nikolayevich is Christ Christ is
Christ but

SOFYA
But what

DUSHAN
I believe hes one of the
prophets God speaks through him
I recognize the cadence in his
voice

SOFYA
This is unbearable No wonder I
feel lonely Im surrounded by
morrons

SASHA
Mama youre being ridiculous

SOFYA
Am I I sit here and listen to
this talk of love and God and
equality knowing full well that
Count Generosity here is fully
prepared to give away everything
we have

TOLSTOY
(exhausted)
You keep going on like thatWhy
do you think we should profit
from the work I’m doing which is
only meant for the sake of the
people

She turns to see Dushan scribbling again

SOFYA
STOP IT STOP WRITING NOW

Valentin glances at Sasha uncomfortable at these
outbursts A long pause Dushan tries to relieve the
tension

DUSHAN
In defense of my gift let me
demonstrate Its quite
remarkable really

He gets up places a record on the gramophone needle on
the record What comes forth is not music but Tolstoys
voice

It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment His voice booms tinny and distorted Dushan
walks to the machine stares at it in awe Valentin is
completely caught up in the technology

VALENTIN
Its your voice Its wonderful

They all listen for a moment look to Tolstoy for a
response

TOLSTOY
Its tiresome Another
remarkable invention will
supercede it

Valentin blushes and looks at the t
hide his disappointment

TOLSTOY
Please excuse me

Tolstoy rises leaves the table wa

spills Valentin moves to wipe it u

Clear eyes Nice features rather
handsome in a peculiar way

VALENTIN
Thank you Countess

SOFYA

Call me Sofya Andreyevna We
dont stand on formality here as
you may have observed

(beat)
Many young men ruin their looks
by loose living Youre a real
Tolstoyan I can tell

VALENTIN
I admire your husband immensely

SOFYA
Thats excellent He likes that

VALENTIN
His ideas are beautifulsocial
justicethe ideaDont you
think

Sofya drains her tea cup signals for more

SOFYA
Hes very grateful for the help
youve been giving him He told
me so himself I think it
surprises him that a young man
would be so diligent When he was
your age he was whoring in the
Caucasus

Valentins eyes are wide She nods

SOFYA
He wrote it all down He even
gave me a copy so I could read
all the details

VALENTIN
Thank you

SOFYA
Youve read War and Peace

VALENTIN
Many times twice

Sofya smiles at his honesty

SOFYA

When he was writing it long
before Chertkov created that
monstrosity at Telyatinki before
all this new religion and
revolutionary nonsense

(beat)
What do you think of Chertkov by
the way

VALENTIN
Hes given me an extraordinary
opportunity

SOFYA
But you see what a fool he is a
self-serving puritanical idiot I
have to say its been extremely
pleasant since theyve locked him
in his house
Sofya smiles Valentin is nonplussed by her directness

SOFYA
When my husband was writing it
in the mid-sixties hed bring me
pages to re-copy everyday
I was the only one who could read
his handwriting I could read his
intentions too Afternoons wed
drink tea and discuss changes
Natasha wouldnt say that to
Prince Andrey or Pierres too
simple here Hes not stupid

She smiles at the memory

SOFYA
But I dont count anymore

Silence She sips her tea She glances out the door to see
Sasha hovering nearby Listening Sasha walks away

SOFYA
You must help me Valentin
Fedorovich I want only what is
best for my husband and my
family I could tolerate the
situation if it only concerned me
What I can not do is sit back
while they steal my childrens
inheritance Do you know I was
the only person I could
understand his intention

VALENTIN
I dont believe anyone wants to
do that

Sofya gives him a condescending smile She produces a
package from the table beside her hands it to him

SOFYA
I have a little gift for you

He opens it extracts a small leather bound book He stares
at it

SOFYA
Its a diary
(beat)
Everyone should always keep a
diary

VALENTIN
Its a very popular activity
around your husband

SOFYA
Youre teasing me but I trust
youll write the truth

VALENTIN
That may not be so easy

to watch her

VALENTIN
He wants to know everything about
me my parents my relations with
women my experience of god -

He looks up to see Masha smiling at him

MASHA
And what relations are these

Valentin blushes goes back to trying to chopping Almost
immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe
He bangs it bangs it trying to free it He glances up to
see her still looking at him He pounds again and again

She stops reaches for his axe touching him as she does
She lifts the big axe log and all above her head
bringing it down hard The log splits She hands the axe to
him

MASHA
I had a lover before I came
here headmaster of a school

where I taught He was married -
happily married It was
difficult We could make love
only at school

This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for

VALENTIN
At school

MASHA
In the gymnasium after the girls
had gone There were straw mats
on the floor

VALENTIN
I see

He looks away to hide his confusion

MASHA
Have I upset you

He looks at her

VALENTIN
NoI appreciate your frankness

MASHA
But you disapprove of me I see
it in your eyes

VALENTIN
I dont Not at allI think
sexual activityhow men and
women combine their physical
parts is completely neutral

MASHA
Listen to you Youre a prig
Just like Sergeyenko Why else
would they have hired you

VALENTIN
Thats not fair

MASHA
I dont care if its fair Its
trueneutralmy God

VALENTIN
Im going

He puts down the axe

MASHA
Do as you like

She goes back to chopping We track in front of him as he
walks toward the house The chopping stops

MASHA
Valentin Fedorovich

He stops relieved and turns to face her

MASHA
You forgot your horse

VALENTIN
Yes You know I think that I
never mind

He hesitates for a moment then starts toward her Her back
is to him She begins to chop again The color rises in his
face as he tries to salvage a little dignity

He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings
trips in a ditch almost falls flat Red faced he rights
himself The chopping behind him remains constant
Sergeyenko watches him from the porch

I hope my work is pleasing to Leo

thats good The reports Ive
received from you however
There seems to be some confusion

VALENTIN
What do you mean

CHERTKOV

You send me never ending
commentary on Tolstoys writing
Thats all very interesting but
not very useful I need to know
what goes on with Sofya
Andreyevna You must see by now
shes committed to undermining
her husbands best intentions

VALENTIN
Its not quite so obvious to me

CHERTKOV
Because she is duplicitous You
are very bright Too bright to
let her into you

Chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze

CHERTKOV
You value our work

you think the Countess suspects
something

How so

VALENTIN
I don’t think she likes you very
much

CHERTKOV

What does she say

VALENTIN
It’s a tone I’ve picked up

CHERTKOV
We simply want to distribute
Tolstoys work to the widest
audience possible She just has
no understanding what it is we
are trying to do There’s nothing
in it for any of us but a real
chance to increase the world’s
happiness

He takes Valentins hand

CHERTKOV
I can only be of limited help to
the master if I dont know whats
going on Any effort she makes to
shore up control of the

He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette

VALENTIN
Masha You are not supposed to
smoke at Telyatinki

VALENTIN
It was difficult in front of the
others

MASHA
But it wasnt difficult in your
bed When it was only you and
me in front of God

VALENTIN

God

Masha emerges from the shadows but keeps her distance

MASHA
So I made you forget God

VALENTIN
No

MASHA
Yes only for a moment You
forgot your rules and remembered
love

VALENTIN
You make it sound very simple

MASHA
It is simple What we did is what
men and women do have done will
continue doing What could be
more simple We touched each
other-- stayed close together
Something passed between us
Something real That is a
betrayal of what Of nothing

DUSHAN
It’s sadly more than possible

SASHA
I know it’s hard for you papa
But we must be realistic

We pan to the french doors to see Sofya furious face as she
listens to the betrayal

CHERTKOV (0S)
Do you really think shes fit to
control the final disposition of
the will

We pan back to the conspirators Before Tolstoy can
respond Sofya charges into the room As she does she
steps on the hem of her long dressing gown and ends up
sprawled on the floor The conspirators just stare at her

SOFYA
How dare you

SASHA
What are you doing
SOFYA
Youre all plotting against me
In my own house too I bear you
thirteen children How can you
betray me like this
(beat)
Someone help me up

No one moves Tolstoy slumps in his chair

SOFYA
Give everything youve got to

dear my Vladimir Grigorivich My
wifes heart on a platter Her
kidneys With salt But of
course my dear Chertkov

Her eye falls on Dushan who very unfortunately has chosen
to take this down in his diary

SOFYA
Give me that Give it to me you
little weasel

She grabs the offending volume The struggle begins

DUSHAN
Please Countess Sofya-

SASHA

She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her
head throws it through the open doors with a guttural
rumbling growl She turns on her tormentors

Freedom from anger Freedom from
attachment Freedom from all the
superstition and nonsense of the
church It moved me so much I
thought thats what it would be
about Isnt that what its
about Freedom and love But
they mix it all up

Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him Her head
falls against his shoulder

MASHA
Come with me Please

INT YASNAYA POLYANA SOFYAS BEDROOMHALLWAY DAY

Sofya in her bed A team of doctors hover over her One of
them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument

We move into the hall to find DR ROSSOLIMO an expert in
mental illness conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and
Dushan

ROSSOLIMO
I believe the Countess suffers
from a mental degeneracy
paranoic and hysterical chiefly
the former

DUSHAN
Yes

The doctor walks back into the bedroom Tolstoy red in the
face walks away down the hall Dushan catches him

TOLSTOY
Why did you bring him here

DUSHAN
Hes an old friend you know
from Rome

TOLSTOY
And astoundingly stupid in the
way of all scientists

Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of
generosity

TOLSTOY
Im sorry my friend but this is
all very upsetting to me

DUSHAN
Yes

Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall
Bulgakov is already there on the step above him

TOLSTOY
Take them downstairs Thank them

EXT ZASYEKA WOODS DAY

It is an autumn afternoon Valentin and Tolstoy pick their
way through the thick undergrowth

As they come into a clearing Valentin is surprised to see
a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers
office in the middle of the wood Sergeyenko fiddles with a
piece of paper on the desk Chertkov comes toward them

Tolstoy stops his horse He turns to Valentin with tears in
his eyes

TOLSTOY
You see I no longer feel I have
a choice in the matter She
isnt

He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov

CHERTKOV
Good afternoon Leo Nikolayevich

TOLSTOY
Is it

They help Tolstoy dismount They lead him to a nearby stump
and place the writing board before him Sergeyenko hands a
document to Chertkov who lays it on the board

CHERTKOV
This will insure that the
complete works will live in the
public domain

SERGEYENKO
Monumentous

CHERTKOV
Your work is the birthright of
the Russian people Now they
possess it forever

Tolstoy looks up at them

CHERTKOV
Yes
TOLSTOY
I need a pen
CHERTKOV

Of course
Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard No pen

SERGEYENKO
Iuh

CHERTKOV

Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov close enough to
whisper

CHERTKOV
Youre a secretary How can you
not have a pen

Sergeyenko points at Valentin

SERGEYENKO
Hes a secretary too Ask him

CHERTKOV
Valentin Fedorovich do you have
a pen

Valentin hesitates for a moment looks at Tolstoy seated
on the stump staring into the middle distance

VALENTIN

Valentin fetches it from his satchel

Pen in hand Tolstoy hovers over the document A long
moment

CHERTKOV
Are you alright

TOLSTOY
I feel like a conspirator

Sergeyenko laughs Chertkov glares at him Its beyond
awkward Valentin looks to the sky sees the crows
circling again

Without further hesitation Tolstoy picks up the pen and
signs the document Then he moves away from the group
Valentin watches him

EXT ZASYEKA WOODS DAY

Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream
Tolstoy seems weary

VALENTIN
Maybe we should get back Itll
be dark soon May I ask you
something that has nothing to do
with work

TOLSTOY
Of course my dear

VALENTIN
Do you love your wife

TOLSTOY

Your youth and your desire for

happiness reminds me cruelly of
my age and the impossibility of
happiness for me When I was
courting Sofya she was so young
and pure it seemed impossible
that Id ever have her

I didnt want to tell her how I
felt and I wanted to tell her
nothing else So I wrote down a
string of letters and asked her
if she could decipher them She
looked completely confused
thinking it was a game or

Tolstoy looks into the middle distance remembering his
love

TOLSTOY
I gave her one clue The first
two Ys I said stand for your
youth and then the most
miraculous thing happened She
simply spoke the phrase my
phrase

Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some
explanation of the miraculous

TOLSTOY
as if she had read my mind
In that moment we both knew we
would always be together For
those first years we were
incredibly happy terrifyingly
happy

His old eyes are wet

TOLSTOY
And now this

Tolstoy reaches into his boot extracts his SECRET DIARY

He takes a pen from his shirt begins to write Valentin is
amazed HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME

of myself when I was young

He goes After a moment Valentin gets up and goes to the
study door

VALENTIN

practice the love of the
Gospels Why do I have to explain
this Perfect love Eternal love
The love that binds mankind
together

VALENTIN
But Ive never met mankind only
men and women imperfect men

imperfect women

CHERTKOV
Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us
love can not be weakminded

into a corner she tears it open and begins to read

muscles in her neck stand out Her shoulders begin to
shake

Crumbling the paper in her hand she twists her head and

jetty toward the water At the edge of the jetty she
falls on her back then turns over most ungracefully and
rolls off sideways into the pond

HIGH ANGLE Sofya sinks into the black water The sound of
her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoys voice
reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand

My position in the house has
become intolerable What Im
doing now is what people have
commonly done - leave their
worldly life behind to spend
their last days in peace and
solitude

water

everything Ive done to you just
as I forgive you with all my soul
