DEEP SIX

EXT THE OCEAN - DAY
Light blue sky fills the screen
The CAMERA PANS lower revealing some thin clouds

Finally the CAMERA SPLASHES below the surface of
the water and continues to descend

Hundreds of bubbles rise past as the camera swims
lazily through azure seas sparkling with sunlight
and teeming with brightly colored tropical fish

The bubbles swirl past as we dive down the water
turning paler the fish becoming duller and more
scarce

A large shark swims past us on the prowl
Deeper and deeper we dive

Soon the water is black as night Only the
faintest slivers of light penetrate down here and
then quickly flicker and die

Large shadowy creatures of the ultra-deep haunt the
edges of our vision

Strange luminescent fish with long pointy teeth
dart past

The sea bottom draws near a flat plain scarred by
an enormous impact crater miles in diameter WE

glide over the outer wall the crater floor looms

beneath us

On the bottom a faint light glimmers

It is an undersea station a series of five
cylinders linked by a central hub It looks like a
giant starfish resting quietly on the ocean floor

Several hundred yards beyond the station the faint
lights of the bio-lab can be seen This is where
all the genetics research is done

2 INT GALLEY
Breakfast

Nine people are seated in the galley

Nobody is talking only the sound of CLANKING
dishware

DR ABERNATHY glances across at DR JERKINS
JerkKins is late fourties high strung His eyes
are a little red and a little swollen He has the
appearance of someone who is not sleeping well at
night

Abernathy takes out a small harmonica from his
breast pocket

Jerkins freezes in mid-bite at the sight of the
harmonica

Abernathy takes his hankerchief polishing the
harmonica He taps it in his palm breaking the
reeds free

Abernathy puts the harmonica to his lips and and is
about to blow

Jerkins starts to say something

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

DEEP SIX

when Abernathy ‘slips the harmonica back into
his pocket In some way he has been teasing
Jerkins

DIANE NORRIS MD has seen-this She doesn’t find
it at all amusing

DREW PIERCE takes a seat at the other end of the
table with three of his fellow support group
JAMES RICHARDSON (Diver) TONY SNYDER
(Communications) and JOYCE COLLINS (Diver) There
is already a plate of food at his place

PIERCE
Good morning campers
(looking down at his
plate) -
I thought we were out of oatmeal

COLLINS
Thats eggs

Pierce gingerly shoves them around on his plate
then looks up at Richardson who is reading a fax -

letter written in a childish scrawl

PIERCE
What have you got there Ace

RICHARDSON
Letter from Julie

COLLINS
Check it out

Collins holds up a fax of a picture drawn in crayon
-- it’s a stick figure man in a dive suit adjacent
to a house under the water All around are
brightly colored trees flowers and fish The
caption at the top reads MY DADDY AT WORK

Pierce leans over to get a-look

PIERCE
Hey that’s pretty good

RICHARDSON

Well it ain’t Rembrandt palbut to
me it’s priceless

2-DRAFT
COLLINS
Isn’t that sweet

RICHARDSON
I told her it was beautiful down here
With flowers and trees

Snyder starts laughing his mouth gorged with food

SNYDER
Whata buncha shit
COLLINS
Must be nice to have a family waiting

for you

This is a conversation they’ve had a thousand
times only this time Pierce gives Collins a
strange look

RICHARDSON
After six months it’s the only thing
that keeps me going

PIERCE
I could go another six monthsas long
as they keep laying on that extra-duty
pay

COLLINS
Come on admit it Pierce Wouldn’t
you like to have a rug-rat of your own
waiting for you when you go topside

But Pierce is busy looking at his watch

PIERCE
Better get the eggheads to work
(standing up calling to
the other end of the
table)
Let’s go The bus for the fish factory
leaves in five minutes

Valdez Craven Abernathy and Jerkins get up
shuffling towards the hatch Collins and
Richardson also rise

Snyder grabs Richardson’s arm as he starts to
leave

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

DEEP SIX

SNYDER
(almost whispering)
Did ya get them

RICHARDSON
Yeah I got ’em You gonna fax my
letter to Julie this morning

SNYDER
You bet First thing

Richardson glances around the galley to make sure
no one is watching then digs into his pocket He
palms Snyder a small bottle of pills

PIERCE
If Norris finds out where you got
these you’re dead meat pal

SNYDER
She won’tthanks man I owe you
one

RICHARDSON

(somewhat disgusted)
Yeah yeah

SNYDER
Hey I just use them to help me to
sleep you know Christ what do you
think I am A fucking junkie

He gives Snyder a scrutinzing stare then exits the
galley As soon as he is gone Snyder opens the
bottle and pops two of the pills

SNYDER
(continuing - to
himself)
Asshole

INT DOCKING BAY

As Pierce leads the others into the DSRV he
Pierce starts to sing

PIERCE

Hi-ho hi-ho It’s off to work we go
Come on eggheadssing along

2-DRAFT
DEEP SIX

The scientists start to sing half-heartedly along
with Pierce

PIERCEOTHERS
Hi-ho hi-ho It’s off to work we go
(some funny verse in
here)
The scientists start to file into the minisub

Laidlaw stands by the airlock shrugging into his

woolies -- insulated coveralls Norris walks up
behind him
NORRIS
Can I have a word with you Captain
LAIDLAW
Can it wait until I get back from the
lab
NORRIS

It’1ll only take a minute

Laidlaw sighs nodding his head

INT MEDICAL BAY

Norris enters the medical bay followed by Laidlaw
she closes the hatch after he is in

NORRIS
Have you made a decision about rotation
yet

Laidlaw leans against the bulkhead sipping his
coffee

LAIDLAW
No Valdez says they’re on the verge
of a major breakthrough He just needs
a few more days

NORRIS
Valdez has been saying that for weeks
now He’s part of the problemhe’s
pushing too hard
(then)
I think we should rotate the whole
science team out

2-DRAFT
LAIDLAW
What’s another week

NORRIS

To a veteran like younothing But
these men aren’t Navy they’re
scientists They’ve been trapped in a
can at the bottom of the ocean for more
than six months now They need a
break

(beat)
I don’t want to go over your head on
this

LAIDLAW
(shrugs)
Look Doctorit’s your call

NORRIS
I’m telling youI’m worried about
them

Laidlaw takes a moment to think

LAIDLAW
Tell you whatwhy don’t we review
these requests on a case by case basis

NORRIS
Fine Here’s a list

LAIDLAW
(reading over the list)
Why do you want to transfer Collins

NORRIS
(simply)

She’s pregnant

LAIDLAW
Does he know

NORRIS
Of course she knows she asked me to
run the

LAIDLAW
I said does he know Does Pierce
Know

NORRIS

She doesn’t want to tell hin

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
(surprised)
Why not

NORRIS
I don’t know He’s not my friend

Laidlaw is cut off by the videocom BUZZER He
crosses to the panel and punches the XMIT switch

LAIDLAW

Laidlaw

Pierce’s face blinks on the tiny monitor
PIERCE
(filtered)
We’re ready to pull out Captain
LAIDLAW
I’m on my way

Let’s talk about this when I get back

NORRIS
I’1l be here

5 INT DOCKING BAYMAINTENANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Laidlaw enters the hatch to the DSRV

6 INT DSRV
Laidlaw crawls into the mini-sub

It’s very cramped Pierce is in the pilot’s seat
in the conning tower donning a headset He starts
flipping switches humming quietly to himself

Collins sits directly beneath Pierce surrounded by
video monitors sonar equipment recorders etc

To her left is the cluster of forward viewing
ports They are covered to protect them from
scratching

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

In the passenger section in back Drs Valdez
Craven Abernathy and Jerkins are already strapped
in

Laidlaw takes his seat next to Collins activating
his monitors Three screens labeled PORT

FORWARD STARBD flicker to life

Pierce calls down to Richardson

PIERCE
Close us up

Richardson closes the hatch sealing them in
Pierce works more controls we hear a loud WHIRR
then a metallic THUD

The DSRV start to sway back and forth as it drifts
free of the Deepstar

Pierce breaks from his humming into a song
PIERCE

-so we sailed on to the sun ‘til we
found a sea of green

LAIDLAW
Oh God please Not again

PIERCE
(starts to sing MUCH
louder) -
--and we lived beneath the waves ina
yellow SUBMARINE
In back we can HEAR Abernathy join in on
harmonica

As Pierce SINGS and Abernathy PLAYS the minisub
sails across the vast crater to the dim lights of
the not-too-distant BIO-LAB

CLOSE ON A DISPLAY SCREEN -- The Advanced Seafloor
Profile Sonar -- ASIPS -- a grid of green lines
that outline the contour of the seafloor slowly
marching towards us like an animated 3-D geodetic
survey map

LAIDLAW
Contact in five-hundred meters and
closing

Laidlaw concentrates on the constantly shifting
sonar display

LAIDLAW
Two hundred meters

Pierce backs off on the throttle the engine

WHINING down as he hits the navigation lights
9 EXT DSRV

Two powerful work lights blaze to life on the

minisub their beams scattered by suspended

particles in the water

Ahead the shadowy form of the Bio-Lab looms up

10 INT DSRV

On the ASIPS the computer graphic image of the
Bio-Lab nearly fills the screen An animated
overlay gives docking instructions to Pierce

The minisub slips slowly into place next to the
docking ring

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

12 INT DSRV
The DSRV mates to the docking ring with a
reverberating CLANG Laidlaw presses the AIRLOCK
PURGE switch and we HEAR the ROAR of compressed
air

The compressed air purges the airlock free of
water

14 INT BIO-LAB - DOCKING BAY

Everybody leaves the sub

15 INT CONTROL ROOM

Valdez and Craven turn on monitoring equipment
while Collins hits the lights

Through the glass wall of the control room the
bio-lab lights flicker on revealing the vast
experimental laboratory

Abernathy and Jerkins zipping up their sterile
suits step into the HOT BOX

16 INT THE HOT BOX - CONTINOUS ACTION

The “Hot Box is the long narrow corridor for
disinfecting persons entering or leaving the bio
lab At either end there are two small pressure
doors set high off the deck

Abernathy and Jerkins move silently through the
Hot Box Neither speaks or looks at the other

17 INT CONTROL ROOM
Laidlaw and Valdez watch through the control room

window as Abernathy and Jerkins go to work setting
up the day’s experiments

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
How close are you John
VALDEZ
Any day now we should have a
breakthrough
LAIDLAW

Norris is putting a lot of pressure on
me to rotate your team out

VALDEZ
You can’t let her do that Captain

LAIDLAW
Shes threatening to go over my head

VALDEZ
All I need is a few more days

LAIDLAW
I can’t run interference for you much
longer Let’s go Pierce

Pierce and Laidlaw head for the docking bay

18 INT BIO LAB DOCKING BAY

Pierce and Laidlaw are crossing the docking bay
headed back for the minisub

LAIDLAW
Look I don’t like butting into other
people’s problems

PIERCE

LAIDLAW
(continuing)

It seems to me that you had something
nice going with Collins and then you
just let it die Collins is great gal
and she’s crazy about you so I ask
myself why is Pierce acting like an
asshole

Pierce scowls

PIERCE
It didn’t work outso what Happens
everyday

LAIDLAW
Don’t you think you owe her an
explaination

PIERCE
What’s there to explain

LAIDLAW
Drew I was there when you got married
I was there when she died I was there
when you put her in the ground I know
how much you loved her but you can’t
let Kathy’s death hold up the rest of
your life You’ve got to get on

Pierce starts to leave

LAIDLAW
Want some advice

PIERCE
No

LAIDLAW

Tough here it comes anywaygive the
thing with Collins another chance

PIERCE
Is that an order

2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
No it’s just advicegood advice

Just then Craven enters the docking bay from the
control room

CRAVEN
Captain you better come quickit’s
Jerkins

19 INT CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Craven Laidlaw and Pierce re-enter the control
room Valdez and Collins watch Jerkins storm
around the bio-lab through the window

LAIDLAW
Okay John what’s the problem

VALDEZ
It’s Jerkinshe’s trapped Dr
Abernathy in the dive well and locked
us out of the lab He says he won’t
come out until he gets to talk to you

LAIDLAW
(to Collins)
Can you get into the lab

COLLINS
- He’s pressurized the hatch We can cut
through it but it’ll take time

LAIDLAW
Let me talk to hin

Laidlaw presses the intercom button

LAIDLAW
Robby This is Captain Laidlaw

JERKINS
Captain I want to go home right now
If you don’t send me home right now I’m
going to flood the airlock and kill
that noisy fat bastard

LAIDLAW
Just settle down Robby Dr Norris
has already told me you want to go home
an I’ve been working on that

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

JERKINS

Norris said I could go home a month

LAIDLAW

I know Rob I know And we are going

to send you home

VALDEZ
(into intercom)
All I’m asking for is a few more
days

JERKINS

I want to go RIGHT NOW I’m sick of
this place i’m sick of these stupid
experiments And I’m sick and fucking

tired of Abernathy and THAT STUPID
FUCKING HARMONICA

LAIDLAW
Okay Rob Okay
(to Valdez)

John just butt out a secondCollins

patch me into the airlock

JERKINS

promises not to play thatthing

LAIDLAW
I just want to make sure he’s okay

Rob Let me do that okayjust let

me make sure he’s okay
(to Collins)
Tie in the airlock

Collins flips some switches

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR

As the airlock camera flickers to life
leans against the airlock wall

LAIDLAW

ABERNATHY

Abernathy

Nothing a good meal and a loose woman

wouldn’t cure

2-DRAFT

LAIDLAW
Hang on We’re going to get you out of
there as soon as possible

JERKINS
Not until he gets rid of that STUPID
FUCKING HARMONICA For six fucking

months that’s all I hear Mary had a
little lamb little lamb little lamb
Jesus Christ LEARN A NEW FUCKING
SONG

ABERNATHY
(Mock serious)
It helps me relax

Laidlaw rolls his eyes He fights to control his
temper in dealing with these men of science

LAIDLAW
Dr Abernathy I want you to promise
not to play your harmonica in front of
Dr Jerkins okay

ABERNATHY
Yeah sure I just thought he wasa
music lover

LAIDLAW
Now Dr Jerkins how about letting Dr
Abernathy out of the airlock He’s
promised not to bother you with his
harmonica anymore Okay

JERKINS
I want to go home How many times do I
have to tell you

LAIDLAW
I told youwe’re working on it

Abernathy rakes his lips across the harmonica
SCREECHING up and down the scales several times in
quick successsion

JERKINS
(filtered)
GODDAMMIT There he goes again I’m
going to KILL that SON OF A BITCH

Abernathy snickers He knows this makes Jerkins
nuts and delights in it like a schoolboy

ABERNATHY

Sorry I had to relieve some stress
JERKINS

Jerkins flips the FLOOD switch on and off
quickly
INT BIO-LAB - AIRLOCK
Several gallons of frigid seawater splash down on

Abernathy He screams

INT DEEPSTAR 3 - COMMUNICATIONS

JERKINS

How do you like that stress asshole
LAIDLAW

Jerkins
JERKINS

I want to go home

Valdez reaches over and presses the MUTE button on
the intercom He turns to Laidlaw

VALDEZ
Captain we have to get him out of
there before he does something stupid
If he harms those specimens we could
lose weeks of hard work

LAIDLAW
What do you want me to do John All I
can do is try to talk him into coming
out

VALDEZ
Let me talk to hin

Laidlaw thinks about this for a long moment

2-DRAFT

DEEP SIX

Through the window Jerkins has been shouting and
waving his arms Suddenly he throws something at
the window where it bounces off with a loud BONK

LAIDLAW
(to Valdez)
Okayyou try

Valdez switches the speaker back on

JERKINS
-istening to me

VALDEZ
Yes Jerkinswe’re still listening

INT BIO LAB

Valdez tries to reason with Jerkins his voice
BOOMING over the intercom

VALDEZ
Jerkins nobody has asked you to
compromise anything here You’re part
of the scientific elite and we’re on
the verge of a new age

JERKINS
What a bunch of bullshit

VALDEZ
The life we are creating now will help
mankind tame the underwater frontier
Just like our forefathers used the ox
and the dog

JERKINS
What Like this thing

Jerkins plunges his hand deep into one of the
smaller specimen tanks pulling out asmall

dis disqusting-looking sea creature -looki sea creature The The thing
SCREECHES SCREEGHES loudly thrashing aba thrashing about in Jerki Ferkins’ hand
JERKINS
(continuing)

What the fuck is this thing Is ita
dog Noooo Is it an ox Noooo

What is it No one knows Were
just building these things for the hell
of it

2-DRAFT

DEEP SIX

Jerkins shakes the sea creature at the monitor it

SCREECHES again as his grip tightens

JERKINS
(continuing)
And what about 11387 What good is
that thing to anyone

He gestures to a large cryogenic chamber frozen
vapor trailing off its side A large red sign on
the door reads

DANGER
HOSTILE LIVE SPECIMEN
DO NOT OPEN

VALDEZ
1138 was a mistake I admit that
But

JERKINS

They’re ALL mistakes

VALDEZ
Mistakes are important steps in the
scientific process

JERKINS
No We don’t know what we’re doing
Can’t you see that ARE YOU BLIND

Just at that moment Dr Abernathy starts up with a
chorus of Mary had a little lamb

Jerkins goes beserk

JERKINS
(screaming into the
airlock)
GODDAMNIT

And with that ins heav a
creature in the direction of the airlock It hits
the control panel where it crashes against the
PURGE button with a loud SPLAT

turns to Collins and Pierce

LAIDLAW
Okay get him out of there

Collins and Pierce carry in heavy welding equipment
from the docking bay

DEEP SIX 2-DRAFT

Collins drops down by the sealed hatch next to the
bio lab and fires up the cutting nozzle tuning it
to a bright blue flame She flips down her welding
mask and starts to cut the hatch
CAMERA FOLLOWS Pierce as she heads back down the
corridor

32 INT BIO LAB - CONTROL ROOM

As Pierce enters Valdez Craven and Laidlaw watch
Jerkins in the bio-lab through the window

LAIDLAW
Is she cutting through the hatch

PIERCE
Yeah figure about five minutes

Through the window Jerkins is strangely silent
He shuffles around the room aimlessly

In his arms he cradles another of the bio-
engineered creatures st ing it gently

LAIDLAW
Just do it

Pierce exits shaking his head

37 INT BIO LAB - SAME TIME

from the hatch where Collins is cutting through

A trapped haunted expression creeps over his face

He crosses the lab to the cryogenic chamber marked

Pierce stumbles in the dark CRASHING to the deck

PIERCE
Son-of-a-bitch

Then the harsh red emergency light flicker on

Pierce gets to his feet moving to the control room
door He tries to open it

Nothing

Pierce opens the door’s emergency access panel and
pulls down on a handle There is a HISS of
compressed air escaping but the door doesn’t move

Crouching down next to the hatch Pierce gets a
handhold on the hatch and strains to lift it The
door slowly GRINDS open but it’s clear it won’t
stay that way on its own

Pierce peers through the ever widening slit in the
door while on the other side

Laidlaw and Valdez are pulling up on the hatch Dr
Craven stands behind then

As soon as the hatch is high enough Pierce props
it open with his shotgun and steps inside

PIERCE
What the hell is going on

VALDEZ
Jerkins opened 1138I heard him
screamand then the lights went out
Then the door closed and sealed

PIERCE
They do that automatically when the
power dies

Where’s Collins

CRAVEN
She was in the bio-labwith Jerkins

Pierce dashes for the hatch to the Hot Box He
pulls down the manual handle and spins the
undogging wheel

Laidlaw points to the red light blinking over the
door

LAIDLAW
You’ve got a fire in there

CRAVEN
Don’t go in

He yanks the hatch open Smoke rolls He peers
into the hot box

PIERCE
Lights are out in there

Pierce grabs an EBS unit and a handlight off the
wall and steps inside

Laidlaw curses pulls the second shotgun from the
hatch - it closes -- grabs an EBS and follows
Pierce

43 INT BIO-LAB - HOT BOX

Pierce steps down into about two feet of water his
flashlight stabbing through the thick smoke that
fills the Hot Box

As he starts wading through the knee-deep water
Laidlaw comes up behind hin

LAIDLAW
Goddamn it You’ve compromised the
whole station There’s procedures for
dealing with

PIERCE
Piss on procedure

They look at each other then Laidlaw shrugs as if
to say what the fuck and hands Pierce a shotgun

PIERCE
(continuing - over his
shoulder to Valdez)
Dr Valdez what the fuck does this

VALDEZ
Well it’s a segmented exoskeltoid
roughly symmetrical

PIERCE
(cutting him off)
I meandoes it have teeth or what

VALDEZ
Ohyes Several thousand very sharp
teeth

LAIDLAW

You had to ask

Suddenly Pierce freezes as his flashlight beam
picks up something floating in the water

Pierce’s beam plays overa large clump of blood and

goo coming to rest on a face recognizable only By

What the hell is that

PIERCE
It’s Dr JerkinsI think

As Pierce looks up ABLACK WRITHING SHAPE SUDDENLY
HURLS ITSELF AT HIS FACE

Pierce and Laidlaw SHOUT in fear staggering back
BOOM BOOM BOOM

They both fire at the shape blasting it down into
the water

The gunshots ECHO through the small corridor for a
moment as Valdez yells

VALDEZ
Did you get it

PIERCE
(grinning)
Yeah I think I killed it

Pierce prods the thing carefully with his shotgun

then picks up theriddled body of a creature
shining his light on it

Valdez peers down from the hatch takes one look
and

VALDEZ
No that’s 1257 It can’t hurt you

Pierce tosses the ugly motherfucker back in the
water

PIERCE
Goddamn right

He and Laidlaw ease through the cut-out hatch into
the bio-lab

Pierce sweeps his flashlight across the lab
cutting through the sprinkler system’s rainy
drizzle

One side of the lab is burned covered in a blanket
of foam Some of the specimen tanks are broken
open others have been blackened from the smoke

WE HEAR

Zzzzzzt POW crackle
The flashlight beam follows the NOISE coming to
rest on the power control bus It has been

smashed Sparks still arc from the loose wires
Insulation still burns

LAIDLAW
Here’s the cause of the fire
PIERCE
Yeah Looks like something smashed

into it

He looks over the control panel finds the
EMERGENCY BATTERY switch and flips it ON

Harsh red emergency lights flicker on giving them
a better view

They search the lab

Okaystay sharp
Laidlaw turns and leaves the lab
Pierce watches him go He leans up against one of
the larger plex specimen containers the back of
his shirt wiping away some of the foam and carbon

In the specimen tank breathing off an EBS unit
She looks out
47 ANGLE ON PIERCE
Totally unaware that Collins is right behind him

Suddenly a loud THUMPING on the tank propels him to
his feet shotgun up and ready as he spins

He sees Collins and can’t believe it Setting the
shotgun down he climbs up on top of the tank
48 BACK TO SCENE

Pierce reaches into the tank and grabs Collins’
wrists and pulls her up

She grins their eyes lock

Nice timing My EBS unit was almost
empty

A slight giggle escapes Collins She grabs
Pierce

Wake up Pierce wake up

She rolls him over face up his features frozen
in a blank and distant stare

She looks down in horror

ON PIERCE

His chest cavity is a mass of swarming CRABS
feeding on his entrails

As she SCREAMS

A depth charge explodes nearby waking Collins
with a SCREAM

It takes her a moment to realize where she is

and shakes him

by the explosion
Pierce fights to stay in control as Collins hangs

Pierce glances around the minisub checking for
structural damage He looks at Collins and
smiles

Above Pierce an emergency kit shakes open
spilling its contents He’s hit on the head by
something that lodges in the maze of pipes and
wiring at his feet

A flare pistol

Collins has lost her grip on the mechanical arm
control but the claw remains imbedded in the
thing’s mouth locked ¢ S21 rashes
thé minisub pitches

PIERCE
For God’s sake let it go

COLLINS
(banging the control)
I can’t it’s jammed
CLOSEUP - DEPTH GAUGE Almost to zero
Pierce’s eyes flick from the depth gauge to the
flare gun -- then to the fuel gauge (the tanks
are almost full) and Fight next door -- the FUEL
DUMP switch

An idea is forming in Pierce’s mind

He reaches above his head to the inside cover of
the escape hatch marked

LIFE RAFTLIFE RAFTLIFE RAFT
He pulls the arming pins

Reaching down he picks up the flare pistol and
tucks it into his waistband

Pierce pops the hatch sucking in as much fresh
air as his lungs will hold

EXT DSRV
The life raft bursts from the hatch and begins to
inflate

On the bow the thing still struggles It rocks
the minisub trying to swamp it

INT DSRV
Pierce shouts down

PIERCE
Let’s go Abandon ship

Collins is trapped under the control panel
She’s trying to wrestle it off but it won’t
budge

COLLINS
I can’t move

Pierce doesn’t hesitate he drops down by her
EXT DSRV
The thing tips the minisub over hard shipping
water down the hatch

INT DSRV
Pierce grabs the control panel and heaves It
just won’t move The sub heels over the other
way water pours into the hatch drenching them
Water rises up past Collins shoulders splashing
over her face She gulps for air getting only
ocean

Pierce is really tired of all of this shit -- he
grabs the goddamn panel and hauls on it

His fingers slip on the heavy wet metal

2-DRAFT

Pierce looks around at the wreckage searching
quickly as another big wave comes down the hatch
totally immersing Collins head

He finds a piece of pipe wedges one end under
the panel and jumps on the other end

The panel lifts a little

Collins bursts clear sputtering seawater from
her lungs Pierce helps her up to the hatch

Scrambling out the hatch Collins trips and
falters

Pierce puts both hands on her ass and shoves her
out the hatch Climbing out after her he
pauses to turn back to the instrument panel

With his foot he kicks the FUEL DUMP switch

242 EXT DSRV-1 24

The fuel is ejected from the minisub with a ROAR
two geysers of fuel and seawater shooting up
into the air

Collins clings to the conning tower

A growing pool of fuel forms around the sub

CLOSE ON THE THING - as it rips free of the remote arm
leaving a large clump of bloody tissue
Setiete ease eee EE oat Att

Pierce pushes Collins into the now-inflated life
raft and shoves it off with his foot He
remains on the sub

COLLINS
What are you doing

PIERCE
Get clear of the sub

COLLINS
Don’t be crazy come on

He steadies himself on the rocking sub grabbing

the flare pistol -- the fuel dump is nearly
complete fizzling out He checks the load

Suddenly

COLLINS
BEHIND YOU

Pierce turns to look -- the thing heaves itself
u the side of the sub towards Pierce It’s
open mouth a torn bloody mess

Pierce takes careful aim on the thing pulling
the trigger

CLICK
Nothing happens

The thing gets a-clawhold pulling itself closer

Pierce’s nostrils flare at the stench as he
checks the flare pistol This time he remembers
to cock it

The thing HISSES

PIERCE
Merry Christmas dickweed

Pierce FIRES

The flare shoots right down the thing’s mouth
- KABOOM

The ocean explodes in a ball of flame

EXT THE RAFT — SAME TIME 24

Collins screams as the minisub is engulfed ina
fireball

The fire spreads quickly across the water

Flames lick at the sides of the raft Collins
grabs a paddle splashing them away

Then she is free

She looks up

ANGLE ON MINISUB - as the sea burns furiously

swimming towards the raft

Collins grabs the paddle ready

WOOOSH

A black figure rockets to the surface She screams

It’s Pierce

Gasping for breath he tries to pull himself aboard

but he’s so goddamn tired he can barely move

Collins helps Pierce into the raft the fuel tanks on

the minisub EXPLODE

They turn and watch as the sub burns slipping slowly

beneath the sea
Then it’s gone

Pierce and Collins lay in the bottom of the raft
exhausted not really believing they made it

After a long long time Collins sits up

COLLINS
Now what do we do

Pierce sits up with a groan -- he is pretty badly
burned ina couple of places -—

He scans the horizon -- nothing but water

Pierce just stares at Collins her wet and matted
hair torn underclothes that aren’t hiding much

He smiles then picks up one of the small plastic
paddles in the bottom of the raft and hands it to
Collins

PIERCE
Row

She sighs as she dips the paddle into the water
Pierce picks up the other paddle and digs in as well
