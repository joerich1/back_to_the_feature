MALE VOICE
(over a black screen)
Two men waiting at the Pearly Gates
strike up a conversation

FADE UP On FREDERICK AIKEN 26 a handsome young turk

AIKENMALE
Howd you die The first man asks
the second

Aiken is wearing the blue and gold of the Union Army

AIKEN
I froze to death says the second
Thats awful Whats it like to
freeze to death

PULL BACK to reveal Aiken has been shot in the abdomen
uniform blood-soaked slumped inside a cold muddy BUNKER

AIKEN (CONTD)
You get the shakes and pain in all
your fingers and toes But eventually
you kind of drift off as if youre
falling asleep
(a beat)
How bout you Howd you die

Revealing Aiken is not alone Best friend NICHOLAS BAKER
27 is nearby - right leg nearly severed above the knee

AIKEN (CONTD)

Heart attack says the first man

You see my wife was cheating on me
So I show up at home unexpectedly

I burst into the bedroom Shes all
alone knitting So I race down to

the basement to find the louse but

no ones there I sprint up to the

attic and just as I arrive I had
a massive heart attack and died

Bakers breathing becomes labored He is beginning to fade

AIKEN (CONTD)
The second man shakes his head
That is so ironic What do you
mean asks the first Well if
youd only stopped to look in the
icebox wed both be still alive

Baker manages to turn towards Aiken rolls his eyes then
begins to gurgle choking on his blood

AIKEN (CONTD)
Hang on Nick Help is on its way

But theres no sign of anyone Aiken his own pain evident
starts up again desperately trying to keep his buddy awake
AIKEN (CONTD)
A blind dog walks into a saloon
(Baker murmurs)
What is it Nick
Aiken lowers himself to hear his comrade

BAKER
Shut up and I promise to live

Suddenly two STRETCHER BEARERS appear As they begin to
cart Aiken away he pushes them off Pointing at Baker --

STRETCHER BEARER 1
But Colonel hes as good as dead

AIKEN
Thats an order

They take Baker away Aiken begins to fade from loss of
blood His eyes flicker SHUT as we --

PULL BACK to a wide shot of a BATTLEFIELD at GETTYSBURG --
littered with the DEAD and WOUNDED

STANTON

President Lincoln sends his regrets --

seems Mrs Lincoln made other plans
--The SOUND of laughter
PULL BACK INT THEATER - STAGE -- NIGHT
As TWO ACTORS perform the farce Our American Cousin One
is dressed as a Victorian DANDY the other as an eccentric
BACKWOODSMAN The setting is an English drawing room
-The SOURCE of laughter
PULL BACK INT THEATER - BALCONY BOX -- SAME
As ABRAHAM and MARY LINCOLN enjoy the performance

The PRESIDENT tilts back-and-forth in a crimson rocking chair
The FIRST LADY lovingly drapes her hand across his knee

A couple in their twenties MAJOR RATHBONE and CLARA HARRIS
are seated nearby

-A POV on the LINCOLNS and their GUESTS
PULL BACK INT THEATER - HALLWAY -- SAME

Revealing the POV is coming from a small PEEPHOLE in the
door leading to the Presidents BALCONY BOX

A sliver of light barely illuminates the viewers identity --
JOHN WILKES BOOTH 26 strikingly attractive and attired

As Booth spies on President Lincoln

MATCH CUT TO
A TALL MAN with a BLACK FELT HAT spying too
PULL BACK EXT MANSION -- SAME

Only hes watching the ENTRANCE to a stately three-story
MANSION from across Washingtons Lafayette Square

Private Residence
of
Secretary of State Frederick Seward

The Tall Man pulls a BOWIE KNIFE from beneath his felt hat
a REVOLVER from his overcoat and crosses the street

He mounts the mansions FRONT STOOP and rings the door BELL
A BUTLER answers

MATCH CUT TO
--The DOOR swinging open

Only instead of the Tall Man entering its a SMALL MAN
wearing a BEAVER SKIN CAP

PULL BACK INT HOTEL LOBBY -- SAME

-And instead of the Mansions entrance were now inside a
plush HOTEL LOBBY crowded with GUESTS

The Residence
of
Vice President Andrew Johnson

The Short Man shuffles UNCOMFORTABLY amidst all the opulence
his EYES flashing to a CLOCK on the WALL which reads

1015 PM
-The sudden POP of a CHAMPAGNE CORK
PULL BACK INT CENTURY CLUB - BALLROOM -- SAME
As Baker opens a fresh bottle Aiken has rejoined his mates
BAKER
Good to see the last four years did
someone good

REVEALING the stunning CATHERINE MORGAN early 20s

BAKER (CONTD)
Hello Catherine

CATHERINE

Catherine warmly greets Baker Hamilton Glances at Aiken

CATHERINE
Johnny Reb get his tongue

AIKEN
How are you Katie

CATHERINE
Not a letter from you in 18 months
I should ask how you are

AIKEN
We didnt see much I wanted to share

CATHERINE
(re Hamilton)
Bill wrote me twice a month

AIKEN
That so

HAMILTON
Just checking in with the home front

CATHERINE
Ones imagination wanders when you
havent a word

AIKEN
Might we have one now - in private

Catherine nods turns back to Baker and Hamilton

CATHERINE
Sure good to see you boys

Aiken escorts Catherine away fingers clasped Hamilton
looks on with envy Baker pops a cigar LIGHTS a match

CUT TO
-The startling BANG of a pistol

An EXPLOSION like the deep POP of a heavy paper bag Then
a BURST of smoke And finally a THUD bullet against bone

PULL BACK INT THEATER - PRESIDENTIAL BOX -- SAME

As Lincolns rocking ceases and his chin pitches into his
chest MARY LINCOLN clutches his neck to keep him upright

Booth stands a few paces behind -- a brass DERRINGER in his
right hand a DAGGER in his left

Major Rathbone lunges for Booth But Booth swings his dagger
wildly piercing the Majors left arm
Booth vaults over the FRONT RAILING and clips his SPUR in
the BUNTING causing him to land awkwardly on the STAGE below

SNAP His left ankle fractures badly above the in-step He
limps across the stage stopping just long enough to YELL

BOOTH
Sic Semper Tyrannis Revenge for
the South
Then rushes past dazed ACTORS and escapes into the WINGS
EXT SECRETARY OF STATE SEWARDS RESIDENCE -- SAME

Just as Booths TALL ACCOMPLICE bursts out the FRONT DOOR
his hands dripping with blood

INT SECRETARY OF STATE SEWARDS RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS
TRACKING through the house to REVEAL whats left behind

-- First the Tall Accomplices BLACK FELT HAT tipped on its
side at the bottom of the staircase

-- Then a GUARD coughing blood writhing along the stairs

-- Followed by an ARMY AIDE badly hurt and bleeding slumped
on the second floor landing

-- Next SEWARDS SON alive but unconscious with a fractured
skull inside a bedroom doorway

-- And lastly SECRETARY of STATE FREDERICK SEWARD in bed
gasping for air and bleeding from a near-fatal facial gash

INT THE VICE PRESIDENTS RESIDENCE - HOTEL LOBBY -- SAME

Booths SHORT ACCOMPLICE with the BEAVER SKIN HAT is frozen
with fear on a bar stool his eyes leaden with drink

A SOLDIER casts a suspicious glance his way causing the
fearful Associate to flee out the front door as we CUT TO --

INT CENTURY CLUB - BALLROOM - SAME

Just as Aiken is placing an ENGAGEMENT RING on Catherines
finger Baker now piss drunk celebrates his mates new
union by drinking champagne from his artificial leg

A SOLDIER rushes past knocking Bakers leg out of his hands

BAKER
What the hell

Suddenly Secretary Stanton is whisked away under heavy
security Followed by several more party-goers

Hamilton approaches Aiken and Catherine his face ashen

CATHERINE
What is it Bill
HAMILTON
Theyve attacked Lincoln - and the
Secretary of State too

Aiken registers the shock As Baker tries to locate his leg
amidst the tumult we DISSOLVE TO --

A near-riotous crowd assembled outside PETERSEN HOUSE a
townhouse across the street from Fords Theater

Torches ablaze Vengeance on many lips

We TRACK with Union MAJOR HW SMITH inside --

INT PETERSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

A small sloped BEDROOM adorned with pastoral prints It is
an unspectacular setting for a spectacular end

DOCTORS CABINET MEMBERS and a PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER surround
PRESIDENT LINCOLN who is laying diagonally across a bed

far too short -- his bare feet dangling over the edge The
only sound is of Lincolns near-final gasps

Major Smith passes a PHYSICIAN carrying a bundle of
bloodstained towels Smith continues down the HALLWAY into --

An adjacent SITTING ROOM now functioning as a WAR ROOM --
SEVERAL ACTORS still in costume are being interrogated
Major Rathbone is trying to console his fiancee Clara Harris
Her clothes are soaked with Lincolns blood

Major Smith surveys the chaos -- revealing EDWIN STANTON is
in charge Stanton beckons him inside a CLOAK ROOM

MAJOR SMITH
It was the actor John Wilkes Booth

STANTON
Are you certain

MAJOR SMITH
They all know him from the theater

Pointing to the ACTORS being interrogated in the other room

STANTON
What about the other assassins

MAJOR SMITH
The only name mentioned so far is an
acquaintance of Booths -- a young
man named John Surratt

STANTON
What do we know about him

MAJOR SMITH
Twenty-one years of age Lives here
in the city with his family Mother
runs a boardinghouse Thats it

STANTON

I guarantee hes a Confederate
Find him Find all of them

(a beat)
I want this city closed down Nothing
leaves Washington without my
authorization No trains No boats
If any one of these assassins gets
South of the Potomac or up into
Canada hell never be found

Major Smith exits Another AIDE approaches

AIDE
Sir the Vice President wishes to
pay his respects

STANTON
He may leave that hotel only when I
say its safe to do so

The Aide nods begins to exit

STANTON (CONTD)
(calls out)
And keep him away from the liquor
Hes liable to drink himself into a
stupor with fright

MARY LINCOLN lets out a piercing wail from the adjacent room

FULL SCREEN On President Lincolns motionless FACE
accompanied by more screams

PULL BACK to reveal the screams are coming from a LOCOMOTIVE
whistling into the night wrapped in black bunting Lincolns
face is actually a PORTRAIT fixed to the front of the train
Lincolns COFFIN is inside

MONTAGE BEGINS

As the train builds speed we INTERCUT between

LINCOLNS DEIFICATION -- Newspaper headlines chronicle the
1700 mile funeral procession from Washington DC to
Springfield Illinois his hometown and final resting place

ASSASSINS Fords Theater is chained shut DOZENS are
arrested in saloons churches outhouses and homes

BOOTH is cornered inside a BURNING FARMHOUSE He is shot
and killed Another accomplice DAVID HEROLD surrenders

The FINAL IMAGES shown are of --
A slender three-story TOWNHOUSE along a residential street

All appears peaceful No sign of the hysteria beyond
Suddenly the FRONT DOOR bursts open

SIX SOLDIERS escort a MYSTERY WOMAN 45 down the front stoop
while her DAUGHTER 22 is restrained by several troops

The Mystery Woman is placed inside a JAIL CELL The DOOR is
slammed shut behind plunging her world into darkness

MONTAGE ENDS
FADE TO BLACK

A glimpse of the unmistakable CAPITOL DOME its American
flag still flying at half-mast for Lincoln

MAY 10 1865
ONE MONTH LATER
INT US CAPITOL -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken races inside the ROTUNDA nearly knocking over an
ELDERLY SENATOR in his path

He sprints across STATUARY HALL past the busts of our
Founding Fathers

Aiken continues down a long HALLWAY lined with Senate offices
a stack of legal briefs virtually spilling out of his hands

Finally he enters through an enormous OAK DOOR bearing the
brass inscription

United States Senator (Maryland)
Reverdy Johnson

He finds REVERDY JOHNSON already long in wait

REVERDY JOHNSON
Mornin young man Nice of you to
show up

AIKEN
My sincerest apologies Senator I
was just finishing the land conveyance
you requested

The Senator performs a cursory review

REVERDY JOHNSON
Youve been up all night on this

AIKEN
Most of it sir

REVERDY JOHNSON
Plus some carousing with your mates

AIKEN
Just a bit

REVERDY JOHNSON
I appreciate your enthusiasm Freddie
I just hope you havent run yourself
ragged nor forgotten the Assassins’
Trial begins tomorrow

AIKEN
No ones talking about anything else
My mates and I hope to squirrel a
seat

REVERDY JOHNSON
Well youve squirreled a chair
instead

AIKEN
Hows that sir

The Senator hands Aiken a stack of papers

REVERDY JOHNSON
Im trying the case Youll be
assisting -- my second chair

AIKEN
But I thought the government was
planning a military court-martial

REVERDY JOHNSON
Indeed Secretary Stanton picked
himself nine generals to serve as
judges -- all for Union and all
friends of the late President

INT GENERALS CHAMBERS -- SAME

REVEALING the MILITARY COMMISSION preparing for trial --
buttoning their Union uniforms pinning on their medals

REVERDY JOHNSON (VO)
In fact hes chosen one of Lincolns
pallbearers to head the Commission

REVEALING the bearded and bespectacled GENERAL HUNTER 62
fastening his pearl-handled saber to his hip

CUT BACK TO

INT US CAPITOL -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Reverdy Johnson continue their conversation
through the hallway of the Capitol

AIKEN
If its a military trial wont the
War Department be handling the
prosecution

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stantons put his most trusted in
charge of the case -- the Chief
Adjutant General Joseph Holt

INT WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTONS OFFICE -- SAME

REVEALING Edwin Stantons devoted aide-de-camp JOSEPH HOLT
56 as he devises a strategy with the War Secretary

The corner features a shrine to Lincoln from Fords Theatre --
Lincolns rocking chair top hat and coat -- blood-stained

CUT BACK TO
EXT US CAPITOL STEPS -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Reverdy descend the steps which are now lined
with folks hawking LINCOLN MEMORABILIA -- death portraits
supposed locks of hair

AIKEN
Then what are we to do

REVERDY JOHNSON
Defend one of the eight

AIKEN
One of the Assassins

REVERDY JOHNSON
Alleged counselor

Reverdy Johnson holds up a NOTE

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
I received a letter this morning
from the lady the one with the
boardinghouse a Mrs Mary

The Senator searches the note for Marys last name Aiken
is quick with the answer

AIKEN
Surratt

REVERDY JOHNSON
She says I once helped her late
husband on a tax matter

AIKEN
But you dont recall

REVERDY JOHNSON
Truth is I dont remember ever laying
eyes on her late husband or her
But shes from Maryland too

AIKEN
Sir the government believes her
son John was Booths right-hand

REVERDY JOHNSON
If they suspect her son then they
ought to try him

AIKEN
Ive heard they have 250 agents out
looking for him Senator you dont
know her But youre still defending
her

REVERDY JOHNSON
Young man it matters none if Ive
heard of Mary Surratt -- or her son
Shes entitled to a defense So I
shall defend her

Reverdy continues onward as Aiken remains frozen in place

GENERAL HUNTER (0S)
Mary Eugenia Jenkins Surratt

PULL BACK INT US ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT DAY

As we REVEAL -- MARY SURRATT 45 -- dressed from head-to-toe
in black her face concealed by a heavy veil (She is the
Mystery Woman shown earlier being led from her home )

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT D)
You are charged with conspiring
aiding and abetting

GENERAL HUNTER 62 reads from parchment his saber dangling
by his side He is surrounded by the members of the MILITARY
COMMISSION nine grizzled Union vets high-ranking all

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT )
The late John Wilkes Booth -- and
his Confederates

SEVEN CONFEDERATES are revealed beside Mary Surratt as
each name is called They are seated inside a raised
PRISONERS DOCK All are in their twenties or early thirties

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD )
David Herold Michael OLaughlin
Edward Spangler Dr Samuel Mudd
Samuel Arnold George Atzerodt and
Lewis Payne

(NOTE Lewis Payne is readily identifiable as Booths Tall
Accomplice George Atzerodt as his shorter one)

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)
In a treasonous plot to murder
President Abraham Lincoln Vice
President Andrew Johnson and
Secretary of State William Seward

The PACKED courtroom stirs with each charge

Hastily converting a BARRACKS into a courtroom inside the
prison for security reasons the chamber measures only 55-
feet x 20-feet with an 11-foot high ceiling The WALLS are
freshly white-washed All FOUR WINDOWS are barred

The PRESS and JUDGES are seated at long TABLES cutting the
room lengthwise The GALLERY (by invitation only) are crammed
in at the rear ARMED SOLDIERS are stationed throughout

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD )
Pursuant to special orders 211 and
216 does the accused wish to offer
a plea

The veiled defendant is frozen with fear

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)
What say you madam Guilty or not

Mary Surratt removes her veil revealing a handsome face

MARY SURRATT
I am innocent

GENERAL HUNTER
Of all charges

MARY
Yes sir I most certainly am

GENERAL HUNTER
In that case as each defendant has
entered a not guilty plea well
begin with the woman first -- the
United States versus Mary Surratt

General Hunter looks to the PROSECUTION table positioned
advantageously by his side

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)
Major Holt please proceed

Joseph Holt rises to begin his chest laden with medals He
is surrounded by a HALF-DOZEN ASSOCIATES

REVERDY JOHNSON
Just a moment your honor

Reverdy Johnson rises directly in front of Mary Surratt
Frederick Aiken his lone associate remains seated beside

GENERAL HUNTER
What is it Senator

REVERDY JOHNSON
I wish to request an adjournment

GENERAL HUNTER
An adjournment We just got here

Even the LAWYERS defending the other prisoners seem shocked

REVERDY JOHNSON
The defendant has been in custody
for over a month But wasnt allowed
to contact counsel until yesterday
(MORE )
REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Ive still not been permitted to
meet with her

JOSEPH HOLT
Your honor a delay will only serve
to prolong the nations sorrow

REVERDY JOHNSON
My learned colleague youve had
four weeks to prepare your case No
doubt assisted by the entire War
Department I believe the defendant
is entitled to equal consideration

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator our fellow citizens must be
allowed to put this tragedy to rest
The sooner we dispose of this case
the better for everyone

REVERDY JOHNSON
Everyone but my client

GENERAL HUNTER
Proceed Major

Holt rises

REVERDY JOHNSON
In that case I move for termination

GENERAL HUNTER
Termination

Aiken turns to the Gallery spotting Baker Hamilton and
Catherine Aiken looks as if hed rather be anywhere else

REVERDY JOHNSON
On the grounds this trial is
unconstitutional

(the gallery stirs)

The defendant is a civilian entitled
to a public trial before a jury of
her peers Not a military court-
martial

JOSEPH HOLT
Military courts adjudicated matters
involving civilians throughout the
war

REVERDY JOHNSON
May I remind the distinguished Major
the war is over Moreover the civil
courts in Washington remained open
throughout the entire conflict And
continue to be as we speak

JOSEPH HOLT
And may I remind the Senator the
Attorney General affirmed the
legitimacy of this proceeding

Holt reaches for a DOCUMENT which he reads aloud

JOSEPH HOLT (CONTD)
Persons conspiring to assassinate
the President -- the Commander-in-
Chief -- are considered enemies of
the State And shall be judged by a
military tribunal as would soldiers
belonging to a hostile force

REVERDY JOHNSON
Soldier Surely no member of
this Commission recalls a figure as
lovely as this under his command

The Senator playfully draws Marys physique in the air
prompting laughter from the gallery

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator you will mind the horror
which summons us

REVERDY JOHNSON
Gentlemen we all mourn the loss of
our most cherished leader But in
our grief let us not betray our
better judgment and execute a reign
of terror

MAJOR GENERAL HARRIS a member of the Military Commission
shouts out with a heavy New England accent

GENERAL HARRIS
Reign of Terror How dare you

REVERDY JOHNSON
Every right-minded citizen desires
the punishment of those responsible
But one must be judged according to
the law -- not as passions see fit

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator I assure you this tribunal
will make every effort to protect
the rights of those on trial But
all Americans have the right to feel
safe and secure

REVERDY JOHNSON
None of us is safe when a citizen
can be dragged from her home held
without charge and denied access to
counsel -- merely on a suspicion

Another Commission Member MAJOR GENERAL KAUTZ mocks Reverdy
Johnsons southern accent Kautz is a New Englander

GENERAL KAUTZ
Mearlay onah suhspicion Sounds
to me like the enemy is among us I
recall Maryland was not among our
most loyal states during the War I
think its Senator ought to certify
his allegiance to this court

BRIGADIER GENERAL HOWE chimes in with his Philadelphia accent

GENERAL HOWE
I quite agree Make him sign

REVERDY JOHNSON
I have served this nation as its
Attorney General That is
certification enough

General Kautz holds up a CONTRACT

GENERAL KAUTZ
Nevertheless Senator We may require
counsel to sign this oath of loyalty
as prescribed by Congress

REVERDY JOHNSON
I am a member of Congress The branch
of government empowered to authorize
military tribunals like this

GENERAL HUNTER
Our authorization comes from the War
Secretary Edwin Stanton -- by order
of the President of the United States

REVERDY JOHNSON

Had our founding fathers desired
tyranny to prevail Im sure theyd
have intended for the President and
his War Secretary to have such
indiscriminate powers

(seething)
But they drafted a Constitution with
laws limiting power not trusting in
human nature to limit itself --
precisely for times like these

(losing his temper)
When our leaders claim to be serving
the People when in fact theyre
only serving themselves

The Gallery erupts The Prisoners beat iron against wood
General Hunter slams his gavel repeatedly

GENERAL HUNTER
OrderOrderSILENCE

Order is barely RESTORED
GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)

This court will stand in recess
Senator In chambers

Off Aiken woefully glancing at his Mates then at Catherine
INT US ARSENAL PRISON - HALLWAY -- A SHORT TIME LATER

The prison CORRIDOR outside the generals CHAMBERS is near-
RIOTOUS -- rabid REPORTERS excited SPECTATORS and the like

Moments later Reverdy Johnson appears in the hallway with
Aiken in-tow The inquisitive PRESS converge in a frenzy

Johnson pulls Aiken into a BACK STAIRWELL to escape the
hoards A SOLDIER bars anyone else from following

As Aiken trails his boss upstairs his face is filled with
panic The pair are in mid-conversation

AIKEN
-But you cant be serious

REVERDY JOHNSON
As serious as the charges against
our client

AIKEN
But defending her ME

REVERDY JOHNSON
She doesnt stand a chance with a
Southerner like me representing her
She needs a Yankee colonel like you

AIKEN
Yes but --

REVERDY JOHNSON
-- Youll do fine son Our nation
still has never executed a woman

AIKEN
This nation never considered a woman
or a man for that matter capable of
murdering the President Im sorry
but I cant take on this case

REVERDY JOHNSON
Course you can boy They taught
you somethin’ at Harvard didnt
they

AIKEN
I mean I wont
(off Reverdys glare)
I wont defend her Not someone who
murdered my Commander-in-chief

TWO SOLDIERS descend the stairs past Aiken and Reverdy
They are guarding an attractive unidentified WOMAN 22
Shes just overheard Aiken and stares him down Aiken
uncomfortable waits for her to pass before continuing

AIKEN (CONTD)
With all due respect sir Ill gladly
find you a rebel to represent her

REVERDY JOHNSON
No court in the Union would judge
that woman fairly with Confederate
counsel

AIKEN
Most folks I know wish for her what
happened to Booth

REVERDY JOHNSON
No doubt youd gladly pull the trigger
yourself

AIKEN
Id hardly be alone

Aiken points to a CROWD outside the PRISON WALLS -- Lincoln
DEVOTEES holding shrines to Lincoln

AIKEN (CONTD)
Look at Lincoln now Remember how
so many used to hate him Now no
one dares utter a word against him
let alone defend his murderer

REVERDY JOHNSON
Alleged counselor

AIKEN
You dont honestly believe shes
innocent

REVERDY JOHNSON
Til proven otherwise

AIKEN
I will not betray my country sir
Nor my friends who died in battle
defending it

The pair now stand directly in front of the COURTROOM DOORS

REVERDY JOHNSON
Im not suggesting you betray your
allegiances Im simply asking
rather telling you to uphold your
oath as an attorney and do your job
(beat)

I demand nothing more And I assure
you neither your mother or father
wouldve accepted anything less

Aiken wavers
AIKEN

Sir I dont see how I can possibly
walk in there

REVERDY JOHNSON
Son sometimes a man must be willing
to ‘walk on faith alone

A beat as we begin to hear
HOLT (0S)
The conspirators attempted what the
Confederacy could not accomplish in
battle
FULL SCREEN On Aiken listening to Holts opening argument

INT COURTROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

HOLT (0S)
To destroy our nation by striking at
our chain of command -- targeting

not only our President but the next
in line his Vice President and
Secretary of State

(Aiken looks distressed)
That a woman - a mother with children -
built the nest where this vile
conspiracy was hatched operating a
safe-house for the assassins to meet

PULL BACK To reveal Mary over Aikens shoulder Both look
equally panicked but for different reasons

HOLT (0S)
Makes Mary Surratt as guilty of this
crime as John Wilkes Booth himself

EXT US ARSENAL PENITENTIARY -- LATER THAT EVENING

A UNION SOLDIER escorts Aiken across the prison grounds -- a
FORTRESS surrounded by BRICK WALLS topped by ARMED SENTRIES
Just beyond the high walls ST JAMES CREEK the foul smelling
repository for much of Washingtons waste

Blanketing the courtyard is a TENT ENCAMPMENT housing the
soldiers who are guarding the prisoners on trial

Aiken crosses through the encampment SOLDIERS gather and
stare Some salute Colonel Aiken Others turn their backs

INT PENITENTIARY - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

We continue with Aiken and his armed escort down a long
CORRIDOR lined with CELLS --

Each cell is packed with PRISONERS Some faces are familiar --
the ACTORS being interrogated after Lincolns assassination
They are still wearing their costumes now in tatters

Off Aikens look of confusion the Guard offers up --

GUARD
The Witnesses sir

AIKEN
How long have they been here

GUARD
Coupla months

Aiken is escorted through a pair of huge IRON DOORS As he
continues down a SECOND STORY CATWALK we REVEAL --

The CONSPIRATORS CELLS eight in all Inside each cell
Aiken discovers the same horrifying sight -- a PRISONER in
solitary head covered by a CANVAS HOOD no slot for seeing
barely a hole for breathing Legs and arms are chained to
IRON BALLS Wrists are separated by piercing METAL MANACLES

AIKEN
Is all this necessary
GUARD
According to orders
AIKEN
Whose
GUARD

Secretary Stanton sir

Aiken lingers momentarily to ponder then continues towards
the FINAL CELL at the end of the corridor

INT MARY SURRATTS CELL -- CONTINUOUS

CELL DOOR number 200 swings opens as Aiken steps inside
MARY is crouching on all fours chained like a barnyard
animal Though not forced to wear a hood her ANKLETS and
WRIST CUFFS are painfully attached STRAW is spread beneath
her a BUCKET for bodily functions is nearby

The Guard remains at the door

AIKEN
Thank you private Thatll be all

The Guard doesnt move

AIKEN (CONTD)
This meeting is confidential

GUARD
Sorry sir

MARY (0S)
Wheres the Senator

Aiken turns toward Mary
AIKEN

Maam hes instructed me to handle
your case
MARY
Really
AIKEN
Is there a problem
MARY
No disrespect Mister
AIKEN
Frederick Aiken
MARY
Mr Aiken how many years have you
AIKEN
Im a month past 28
MARY
Young man youre barely older than
my son
AIKEN

The Senator would not have placed me
in this position unless he had
complete confidence in my abilities

MARY
I take it then youve handled cases
like this before

AIKEN
Maam theres never been a case
like this before

MARY
But you have defended others

Aiken is silent

MARY (CONTD)
I see theyve left nothing to chance

AIKEN
I take it then youd prefer to conduct
your own defense

A beat Off Marys silence Aiken opens his notes
AIKEN (CONTD)
Very well I understand you own a
boardinghouse at 604 H Street is
that correct

MARY
Yes

Aiken awaits more information Mary offers none

AIKEN
Maam all I know about you is what
Ive read in the papers And what
theyre reporting isnt flattering

Mary grudgingly

MARY
I moved there a year ago with my son
and daughter after my husband passed
away

AIKEN
The conspirators were frequent
visitors to your boardinghouse were
they not

Aiken doesnt even bother to call them alleged conspirators

MARY
As were many others

AIKEN
But you dont deny having been
acquainted with John Wilkes Booth
or the other prisoners behind bars

MARY

No sir I do not

(sternly)
Mr Aiken my husband died a drunk
leaving me with loads of debt
I had no other way to support my
family except by renting rooms to
boarders I considered those men
customers nothing more

AIKEN
Did you consider their sentiments

MARY
I did not inquire as to their
‘sentiments’ sir

AIKEN
What about yours maam

MARY
I am a Southerner by birth a
Christian by belief and a devoted
mother above all else And I am NO
assassin

AIKEN
Maam your freedom will depend on
far more assurance than that

MARY
Well then you tell me what I should
say to those Generals
A beat

AIKEN
Nothing The rules prohibit you
from testifying in your own defense
I suppose you know of someone else
who would Your son John perhaps
Any idea where he might be

MARY
I do not Even at 21 Mr Aiken
hes still my baby My son will be
kept out of this

AIKEN
That wont be easy maam Hes on
the wanted poster

AIKEN (CONTD)
How about his roommate Louis
Wiechmann Shall I call on him to
testify

MARY
Louie is like a member of my family
I dont want any harm coming to him
on account of me

AIKEN
Is there anyone I can call upon to
give your version of events

MARY
Who are they calling to give their
version

AIKEN
The Government is not revealing its
list of witnesses or the evidence
it plans to use against you

MARY
They cant do that can they

AIKEN
This is a military proceeding in
which the Government can do just

about anything it chooses Of course

it makes preparing a defense more
difficult

MARY
Of course But what difference does
it make Even these failing eyes of
mine can see those Generals made up
their minds -- just by the way they
were looking at me

AIKEN
Looking at you

MARY
Just like you Colonel

A GUARD appears with Marys dinner hardly appetizing Aiken
heads for the door

AIKEN
I must go

MARY
Mr Aiken
(Aiken stops)
I havent a word from my daughter
since they put me here Would you
check on her for me Please

He reluctantly nods

MARY (CONTD)
Thank you Mr Aiken I see youve
got a spark of human feeling in you
after all

EXT SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

The three-story townhouse seen during the round-up of the
alleged assassins Aiken climbs the front stoop and knocks
A Union SOLDIER is posted outside her door

Aiken feels a PRESENCE behind -- NEIGHBORS spying from WINDOWS
and DOORWAYS Aiken flips his collar to conceal his identity

Finally the boardinghouse DOOR opens

AIKEN
Anna Surratt

REVEALING ANNA SURRATT 22 -- a beautiful young woman whos
had to grow up very fast

AIKEN (CONTD)
My name is Frederick

ANNA SURRATT
I know who you are Mr Aiken

AIKEN
Then you know Im representing your
mother

ANNA SURRATT
I was under the impression you could
not -- or rather would not
Aiken now places her from the stairwell inside the courthouse
AIKEN
Im sorry you heard that It was
meant to be a private conversation

Aiken nervously glances back at the Neighbors
ANNA
Are you afraid or just embarrassed
to be seen with me Mr Aiken

AIKEN
Your mother asked that I check on
you

ANNA

If you will be so kind please tell
her not to worry

She begins to close the door
AIKEN
Actually I was hoping to get a look
inside

He begins to enter She momentarily blocks his path then
reluctantly steps aside so he can enter

INT VESTIBULE -- CONTINUOUS
As Aiken enters the boardinghouse he surveys the scene

AIKEN
Are you the only one here

ANNA
Business tends to slow down when
theres a soldier stationed out front
day and night for my protection

AIKEN
Ill take that as a yes
ANNA
Yes
Aiken moves from room-to-room -- each strikingly cozy and

familial DAGUERREOTYPES of the Surratts line the mantels

AIKEN
(under his breath)
Its perfect

ANNA
Pardon

AIKEN
Sorry its nothing

ANNA
Please do tell

Aiken says nothing
ANNA (CONTD)

Mr Aiken Im sure Ive heard much
worse in the past month

AIKEN
Very well I was thinking this would
be the perfect place to conspire to
overthrow the government

ANNA
No one would ever suspect right

Aiken doesnt know what to make of Anna

AIKEN
May I take a look upstairs

Anna knows why Aiken is here Without missing a beat --
ANNA

My brothers room is the third on

the left
INT SECOND FLOOR -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken ascends the narrow STAIRCASE up to the SECOND FLOOR
then crosses down a short HALLWAY He enters a small BEDROOM
with two single beds a desk and dresser inside
Aiken begins to carefully search the bedroom -- underneath
the beds the desk then inside the DRESSER He finds
undergarments rolled socksand finally a slip of PAPER
Just as he pockets the paper Aiken is startled from behind

ANNA

Aiken quickly recovers Rises

AIKEN

ANNA

A beat

AIKEN
Miss Surratt do you have records

We hold on Anna as we CUT TO --

As Anna produces a REGISTRY from beneath the floorboard
She hands it to Aiken

AIKEN

Anything else youre hiding

(silence)
If you know where he is I need to
know Is that clear

ANNA

Do you have siblings Mr Aiken
AIKEN

No
ANNA

I thought not

Suddenly there is a tremendous CRASH --
Glass sprays across the floor

Aiken dives on top of Anna placing them nose-to-nose
A large ROCK rests beside them inscribed in blood-red

DIE REBEL DIE
Aiken pulls himself off Anna races OUTSIDE revolver drawn
EXT BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken turns to the Guard outside the door still standing in
place as if nothing has happened

AIKEN
Who did that

SOLDIER
Did what sir

AIKEN
Youre telling me you didnt just
see someone throw that rock
SOLDIER
Guess I missed it sir

Aiken gets it He returns back inside
INT BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken commands Anna his gun still drawn

AIKEN
Pack up Im getting you out of

ANNA
Im not going anywhere
AIKEN
Its not safe for you to be here all

alone
Anna calmly picks up the rock and walks it across the

ANNA
Ive managed thus far

She places the rock on a shelf steps back revealing a
pile of similar rocks

AIKEN
Lets go I will arrange for other
accommodations

ANNA

AIKEN

I will not have it on my conscience
should something happen to you

ANNA
Would you please holster your weapon
Colonel
Off Anna remaining resolute we CUT TO --

INT BEDROOM -- SHORT WHILE LATER

As Aiken now prepares Louis Wiechmanns bed for sleep

ANNA
Breakfast is at seven Supper at

AIKEN

As Anna starts to exit she calls out

ANNA
Youre on your own for lunch

FADE TO BLACK
Remain in DARKNESS and SILENCE for several beats indicating
the passage of time then the SOUND of a SLAMMING DOOR
Aiken LIGHTS a lantern as we --
FADE UP INT BEDROOM -- HOURS LATER MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Aiken startled AWAKE from a deep sleep tries to make out
the VOICES coming from downstairs accompanied by BOOTS
clomping across hardwood floors
He rises from Wiechmanns BED heads toward the noise --
STAIRWELL
Tiptoeing downstairs to the --

GROUND FLOOR

The voices grow louder as he nears the PARLOR DOOR which is
slightly ajar Aiken creeps forward trying to peek inside

Aikens POV of a HALF-DOZEN MEN crowded around a table
Anna is serving them coffee

Aiken inches closer to get a better look The FLOORBOARD
buckles beneath in the spot where Anna hid the registry

The creak of the floorboard silences the voices inside
Suddenly the DOOR swings open on Aiken

He is frozen in place
MALE VOICE (0S)
What kept you Freddie Weve been
waiting a long time

Aikens expression turns to shock as we reveal the speakers
identity -- JOHN WILKES BOOTH

SLAM CUT TO
PRESENT TIME INT BEDROOM

Aiken wakes with a start from his BAD DREAM His brow is
soaked with sweat concern etched across Aikens face

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP
EXT US ARSENAL PRISON - FRONT GATE -- NEXT MORNING
The atmosphere outside the prison is part-carnival part-mob --

VENDORS hawk SOUVENIRS and REFRESHMENTS while an angry MOB
eagerly awaits the first witness in Mary Surratts trial

They are carrying PLACARDS calling for the prisoners heads
A life-size EFFIGY of Mary Surratt hangs from a lamp pole

MARY SURRATT (0S)
How is she

PULL BACK INT COURTROOM -- SAME

Mary leans across the bar to confer with Aiken The other
prisoners on trial are seated beside her

AIKEN
Your daughter is fine Shes
looking forward to the day you come
home

MARY
Its nice of you to say -- even if

you dont think that day is coming
any time soon

HOLT (0S)
In the matter of the United States
v Mary Surratt

The Prosecutor JOSEPH HOLT announces to the court

HOLT
-the People call as their first
witness -- Lieutenant Louis Wiechmann

LOUIS WIECHMANN 22 marches in PATRIOTISM personified --
resplendent in Union blue He settles confidently into the
WITNESS BOX at center as the BAILIFF stands ready

Aiken leans over to Mary

AIKEN
Why would the prosecution be calling
him

MARY

I have no idea

BAILIFF
Take this Bible in your right hand
Now repeat after me

Mary looks at Wiechmann who in turn looks away

BAILIFF WEICHMANN
(responsively)
The evidence I shall give before
this Court shall be the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth

Major Holt approaches the witness

HOLT (0S)
Lieutenant Wiechmann are you
acquainted with the defendant Mary
Surratt
WIECHMANN
Yes Yes I am I attended divinity
college with her son John

HOLT
Until recently you resided at the
boardinghouse owned by Mrs Surratt
Isnt that correct

WIECHMANN
That is correct sir

Holt gestures to the prisoners dock
HOLT
Were any of those prisoners ever
present in her home

WIECHMANN
Yes sir Those five to the right

Pointing at the five furthest to the right -- HEROLD ARNOLD

OLAUGHLIN ATZERODT and PAYNE

WIECHMANN (CONTD)
They were present many times

HOLT
At whose invitation

WIECHMANN
Her sons

AIKEN
Objection

HOLT
Objection

Aiken rises but tentatively

AIKEN
Uh yes theres no way of knowing
I mean no foundation John Surratt
even knew these men -- let alone
invited them And since Mr Surratts
whereabouts are unknown at this time
the question calls for speculation

GENERAL HUNTER
Mr Surratts absence from this
proceeding is Mr Surratts problem
Objection overruled Continue Major

Aiken sits down
HOLT

Was John Wilkes Booth a frequent
guest of John Surratts
WIECHMANN
Indeed But all the Surratts adored
him John His sister Anna And
their mother too

Wiechmann glances at Mary

HOLT
Were there ever meetings at the
boardinghouse involving Mr Booth

WIECHMANN
Many Sometimes lasting two three
hours And always in secret behind
closed doors

HOLT
Did you ever see Mary Surratt object
to these meetings

WIECHMANN
No sir

HOLT
Or to the presence of those men

Pointing at the prisoners
Wiechmann and Marys eyes meet then Wiechmann looks away

WIECHMANN
No I did not She appeared to
welcome them

HOLT
Thank you Lieutenant Thank you
very much Thatll be all for now

Wiechmann rises and begins to leave Aiken is fumbling
through his notes He seems lost

AIKEN (0S)
How long did you say these ‘secret
meetings lasted

Wiechmann stops in his tracks Returns to the witness box

WIECHMANN
At least twothree hours

AIKEN
Yes thats right

Finally Aiken looks up from his notes

AIKEN (CONTD)
So if you were timing them
Lieutenantthen I suppose these
secret meetings werent actually a
secret kept from you

WIECHMANN
I knew about them sir But I had
no knowledge of what they were about

AIKEN
Thats because you never attended
any yourself

WIECHMANN
Exactly
AIKEN
And why was that
WIECHMANN
I thought them suspicious
AIKEN
Suspicious So then you did know

what they were about

WIECHMANN
No sir I did not

AIKEN
Then why were your suspicions aroused

WIECHMANN
By the snatches of rebel conversation
I overheard in the hallways And by
their frequent whisperings

AIKEN
Well in that case Why didnt you
immediately report your suspicions
to your superiors at the War
Department

WIECHMANN
My suspicions werent of a fixed and
settled nature

AIKEN
Fixed and Settled Were you
instructed to use those words

WIECHMANN
Absolutely not

Aiken ponders a moment then sits down

GENERAL HUNTER
If theres nothing else Colonel

AIKEN
Uh I do have something else sir
Tell me Mr Wiechmann Tell us
Have you ever been to Richmond

HOLT
Objection

AIKEN
I merely wish to know if the
Lieutenant has ever visited the
capital of Virginia - and Confederacy

General Hunter nods for Wiechmann to answer

WIECHMANN
I dont recall

Aiken withdraws the slip of PAPER -- the one he pocketed the
night before at the boardinghouse

AIKEN
Perhaps this train receipt will
refresh your memory It indicates
passage to Richmond and has your
name on it

WIECHMANN
Yes Thats right I considered
continuing my divinity studies there
after the war I plan on becoming a
minister

AIKEN
A noble calling indeed At what
institute in Richmond did you think
of enrolling

WIECHMANN
The name
AIKEN
Yes Lieutenant The NAME
WIECHMANN
Well ah
HOLT
Objection
AIKEN

There is no academy of the kind in
Richmond is there sir

HOLT
Objection your honor

AIKEN
Perhaps you visited Richmond for
another purpose entirely

HOLT
The question is argumentative

AIKEN
Ill withdraw the question
Lieutenant you worked for the General
in charge of rebel prisoners did
you not

WIECHMANN
Yeah so

AIKEN
So perhaps a distinguished clerk
like yourself knew information

WIECHMANN
What sort of ‘information

AIKEN
Of the sort that mightve been of
divine interest to many rebels within
the capital of the Confederacy

HOLT
Objection your honor The witness
is not on trial here

The prisoner LEWIS PAYNE yells out from the dock

LEWIS PAYNE
He ought to be

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection allowed The witness is
not on trial

AIKEN
Sir I am simply trying to establish
the credibility or rather the
lack of credibility

HOLT
Objection

GENERAL HUNTER
Colonel Aiken you are incriminating
the witness

AIKEN
incriminating the witness The
Lieutenant shared a room with John
Surratt I think it reasonable to
conclude Mr Wiechmann might know a
thing or two about this plot to
assassinate our President

HOLT
Your honor what the Colonel
concludes is entirely irrelevant

GENERAL HUNTER
Counselor unless you have something
more pertinent to ask the witness
will stand down

AIKEN
No sir No I have nothing more
pertinent to ask
EXT CENTURY CLUB -- EARLY EVENING

A discrete BRASS SIGN is all that identifies the entrance
Illuminated by GAS LANTERNS it says all one needs to know
about the elite all-male SOCIAL CLUB inside

The Century Club
- A Gentlemans Preserve -

INT CENTURY CLUB - SMOKING ROOM -- SAME

Aiken enters the smoke-filled room A HALF-DOZEN young
HOTSHOTS including Baker and Hamilton are playing poker

HAMILTON
Someone should tell the Colonel hes
got on the wrong uniform

AIKEN
I thought were permitted to dress
down in here if no lady is present

BAKER
Freds right

HAMILTON
My mistake then I just thought the
Colonel traded his blues for gray

Several laugh at Aiken

AIKEN
Is Treasury now hiring arselickers
or did they make an exception for
you Bill ‘Cause after Im done
making a name for myself in the trial
of the century Ill need to protect
my rear

The men start laughing at Hamilton

HAMILTON
That name is Judas

Hamilton rises Squares off with Aiken

BAKER
Knock it off Hamilton Aiken sit
down and join the game

AIKEN
Ive got to prepare for trial

BAKER
Youve got time enough for a drink
Hamiltons buying

Aiken reluctantly takes a seat Baker deals Aiken in
BAKER (CONTD)

So Freddie Tell us How did you
know

AIKEN
Know

BAKER
That the Lieutenant was lying That
theres no divinity school in all of
Richmond

AIKEN
I didnt

BAKER
You bluffed

AIKEN
And he folded

Several chuckle aloud with the notable exception of Hamilton
who refuses to join in any adoration of Aiken

At that instant SECRETARY STANTON passes by the door
Stanton holds a menacing gaze on Aiken for several moments
before exiting frame Hamilton observes the exchange

HAMILTON
Appears the Secretary doesnt care
much for your cards

HOLD ON Aiken looking visibly troubled
INT US CAPITOL - REVERDY JOHNSONS OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

Aiken still concerned confers with Reverdy Johnson who is
reviewing the previous days TRIAL TRANSCRIPT

AIKEN
He did not look pleased

REVERDY JOHNSON
Your cross wasnt exactly what
Stantons kangaroo court had in mind
Im sorry I wasnt there to enjoy
it

Reverdy smiles Aiken does not

AIKEN
Wiechmann wouldve said anything to
save his hide But it still doesnt
justify Mary Surratt befriending
Booth or the others

REVERDY JOHNSON
The makings of a case but hardly
proof beyond a reasonable doubt

AIKEN
What about those secret meetings
Wiechmann testified to

REVERDY JOHNSON
Louis Wiechmann is a liar You
practically said so in court

AIKEN
Wiechmann is just the start Who
knows what else theyve got on her

REVERDY JOHNSON
Exactly ‘Cause Stanton is keeping
it under lock and key -- in violation
of every known rule of evidence

AIKEN
If the Secretarys so out of line
why are we the only ones saying so
Not one court in the nation has
objected to this tribunal And the
public supports it ten to one

REVERDY JOHNSON
Because everyones scared to death
You did read Cicero at that fancy
school of yours

Aiken nods

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Inter Arma Silent Leges

AIKEN
In time of war the law is silent
(a beat)
But the war is over

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton intends to keep it alive for
as long as he sees fit

Reverdy pushes a newspaper in front of Aiken HEADLINE reads

Stanton warns of future Rebel Plots
Poisoning Nations Water Supply
Spreading Smallpox and Firebombing Cities

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Fear is the most potent weapon in
the Secretarys arsenal

AIKEN
Whos to say any of this wont happen
The unthinkable already has 600000
men slaughtered on the battlefield
Our President murdered while in
office The world has changed --
and so must we

REVERDY JOHNSON
Dont be so eager to throw away Mary
Surratts rights One day you may
need them

AIKEN
Sir I appreciate your confidence in
me I really do But you should
find someone who gives a damn if her
rights are violated I dont Not
after what she did

REVERDY JOHNSON
Youre right Fred I cant expect
you to care I1l tell you what
if you prove to me beyond a reasonable
doubt shes guilty Ill take you
off this case

AIKEN
Are you serious sir

Reverdy nods Aiken smiles

REVERDY JOHNSON
You think itll be that easy

AIKEN
I know it

EXT US ARSENAL PRISON -- MORNING
As the SUN beats down on the prison walls
INT MARY SURRATTS CELL -- SAME

Aiken enters and finds Mary to his surprise kneeling in
prayer before a Catholic priest FATHER WALTER late-30s

AIKEN
Pardon me Father I wish to confer
with the prisoner

MARY
Speak freely Mr Aiken

AIKEN
Alone if you dont mind

MARY
All things are naked and open unto
the eye of the Lord

FATHER WALTER
Quite all right Mary I must be
going anyway See you in a week

MARY
Thank you for visiting Father Walter
Your words were most comforting

Father Walter departs Mary puts aside her Bible removes
her reading glasses

MARY (CONTD)
Search me and know my heart
(MORE )
A beat

MARY (CONTD)
Try me and know my thoughts And
see if there be any wicked way in
me

AIKEN
The Lord knows the way of the wicked
and the way of the wicked will perish

MARY
You know your Proverbs young man

AIKEN
My father read them to me each night

MARY
Is that right

AIKEN
Said it contained all I needed to
know Good versus evil right versus
wrong

MARY
Is your world so black and white

AIKEN
When it comes to doing whats right

MARY
So what is it you wish to know

AIKEN
Why Booth and his associates were
constantly in your home

MARY
I ran a boardinghouse Mr Aiken
Forgive me if I chose to fill it
with boarders

AIKEN
I checked your registry Theres no
record Booth ever stayed with you
Fact is he checked into the National
whenever he came to town So why
was he a regular in your home

MARY
I suppose my son invited him They
were friends

AIKEN
A famous actor like Booth engaging
your son out of friendship I find
that hard to believe

MARY
My Johnnie is no less a gentleman
than you Mr Aiken and capable of
forming acquaintances in society

AIKEN
Ive read all about your familys
acquaintances maam About your
late husband contributing to the
Confederate cause about your eldest
son Isaac fighting for the rebel
army down in Texas and about your
Gentleman Johnnie too

MARY
What about him

AIKEN
He made quite a sum as a Confederate
courier carrying rebel secrets across
enemy lines So I know damn well
what your familys capable of and I
know youre not telling me the truth

MARY
Then you know what I do not

AIKEN
You were despondent over losing the
war and wouldve done anything to
save the Confederacy -- including
using your own son John

MARY
Honestly Mr Aiken

AIKEN
So you arranged a meeting with Booth --
figuring hed befriend your son
because of what John knew -- what
expert couriers know --

MARY
And what might that be

AIKEN
The best escape routes out-of-town

MARY
I take it theres more

AIKEN
Your son was supposed to lead the
other assassins to freedom that night
Except your son was the only one
that got away

MARY
Quite persuasive Mr Aiken Except
my son was up in Canada at the time
of the assassination

44

AIKEN
Where exactly in Canada was he

MARY
Exactly I dont know

Off Aikens DISBELIEF

MARY (CONTD)
Does your mother know your exact
whereabouts at all times

Silence

MARY (CONTD)
Very well

Mary withdraws a wrinkled POSTCARD from inside her corset

MARY (CONTD)
My son sent this to me from Canada
the same day as the assassination
Proves he was out-of-town that night

AIKEN
Proves nothing He couldve had it
sent

Aiken drops the card It flutters to the cell floor Mary
scrambles in her chains to retrieve it Aiken looks down at
Mary with a cold detachment
AIKEN (CONTD)
Perhaps to save your daughter youd
consider telling me the truth
Mary turns looks up beseechingly at Aiken

MARY
Whats happened to Anna

Aiken LIES to her

AIKEN
Shes disappeared

MARY
Where to

AIKEN

I have no idea I suspect they intend
to hang her alongside of you

MARY
Youre cruel Colonel Aiken

AIKEN
If you want to help her maam you
better start telling me the truth

MARY
Ill tell you anything to protect my
daughter Even if it means confessing
to something I did not do

AIKEN
Guard

Aiken raps on the cell door

AIKEN (CONTD)
Im not defending your lies any
longer And I damn well am not making
enemies on account of you

Aiken begins to exit

MARY
You say you want the truth Mr Aiken
But youre so blind with vengeance
you cant see it anymore

AIKEN
Try me

MARY
My son abhorred the North We all
did How can a Southerner not feel
anything but bitterness towards your
side for denying us our independence
But my son did not conspire to kill
your President

A beat Aiken turns to leave

kidnappers await Booths signal to strike

Suddenly Surratts HORSE bucks prematurely

The COACHMAN spots him then the others He strikes his
whip plunging his Carriage forward Booth SIGNALS to pursue

The Carriage races ahead Booth and Payne cut through the
WOODS The Coachman takes it too fast around a curve causing
his Carriage to pitch momentarily onto two wheels

Booth and Payne intercept the Carriage their RIFLES drawn
Surratt is the last to pull up alongside

Everything is already well under control The Coachman is
unlocking the Carriage door But Surratt is overeager and
pokes him with his GUN

JOHN SURRATT

He exclaims as the Carriage door is pulled open revealing --
TWO MIDDLE-AGED LADIES -- corpulent and panic-stricken

Booth looks DAGGERS at Surratt

Aiken is rapt as Mary reveals the details of the plot
MARY
Seemed they planned on ransoming him

in exchange for all the Confederate
soldiers kept inside your prisons

AIKEN
Why didnt you report them to the
authorities
MARY
Cause one of them was my son
AIKEN
Instead of kidnapping the President
your son helped murder him -- and he

nearly got the Vice President and
Secretary of State as well

MARY
No Not my Johnnie

AIKEN
Damn it maam You just said so
yourself

MARY
No my son is not a murderer

Aiken thrusts Marys BIBLE at her

AIKEN
Swear to it

Marys agony is evident

As we CUT TO --

INT SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

DOWNSTAIRS Anna cooks a meal for many UPSTAIRS Mary enters
her sons bedroom to find John busy packing

MARY
Wash up Johnnie Supper will be
ready shortly

JOHN SURRATT
I cant stay mama I have to leave
town straightaway

MARY
What could be more pressing than
fried chicken

JOHN SURRATT
Nothing that need worry you Just
some cotton speculating thats all

MARY
Dont sport with me son Youre
not stepping outside this house

JOHN SURRATT
Dont speak to me like Im a child

MARY
You and Anna are all the family Ive
got left Ill be damned if I let
you run off and do something else
foolish

JOHN
Foolish What Im fighting for is
far more important than any of us

MARY
Sweetheart nine tenths of our army
is buried underground You think
theyll wait until we grow another
The war is all but over love There
is nothing more you can do

JOHN
The war is far from over mother
Theres still much we can do

John turns to leave Mary grabs hold

MARY
John please

JOHN
Unhand me mother

But Mary wont let go John pushes Mary as he tries to break
free She stumbles banging her face on the table -- cutting
her eyebrow Blood begins to trickle down her face

BOOTH (0S)
(shouts from downstairs)

John are you coming or not
JOHN SURRATT

For Gods sake mother if this cause

aint worth dying for what is

He turns and exits Off Marys dismay we CUT BACK TO --

AIKEN (0S)
And this happened when

PRESENT TIME INT MARYS CELL --
A SCAR now healed is above Marys RIGHT EYE

MARY
April 3rd

AIKEN
Eleven days prior to the
assassination
Mary nods Tears are streaking her face
AIKEN (CONTD)
So then you admit your son did
conspire to murder President Lincoln

MARY
I dont know

AIKEN
May God help you

Aiken turns for the door
MARY
Honestly I dont Lord I pray
not I only know that I did not
(a beat)

I swear
Marys hand is on the Bible Off Aiken and Mary in silence
EXT ARSENAL PENITENTIARY -- MOMENTS LATER DUSK
As Aiken exits the front gate

He stops and turns back toward the prison -- with a look of
stunned disbelief

And then continues on his way
EXT BOARDINGHOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER

Aiken purposefully ascends the front stoop He salutes the
new SOLDIER posted out front and enters without knocking

INT BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken beelines for Anna who is sweeping up shattered glass

AIKEN
You knew about the train ticket
didnt you

ANNA

And good evening to you Colonel
Did you see my mother

AIKEN
Shes fine

ANNA
You told her not to worry about me

Again Aiken lies

AIKEN
Yes I told her Why didnt you
just give me the ticket Instead of
hoping Id find it

Anna ascends a ladder to fix a broken window

ANNA
Because you never wouldve offered
it in Court

AIKEN
What are you talking about

ANNA
Chain of Custody the ability to
guarantee evidence from collection
to presentation in Court

Off Aikens surprised look Anna explains --

ANNA (CONTD)
Counselor a boardinghouse with no
guests leaves one with plenty of
spare time

Then nods to a stack of law journals nearby

AIKEN
Then youre aware I cant possibly
defend your mother unless I know
whats coming next

ANNA
Meaning

AIKEN
I believe you know what witnesses
the prosecution may call and the
evidence theyll use against her

ANNA
Wonderful Mr Aiken Now youre
accusing me of building the nest
At least youre introducing reasonable
doubt for my mother

Smash Anna whacks a broken pane from the window

AIKEN
Do you need some help

ANNA
I can manage

AIKEN
Please let me do it

ANNA
Thanks just the same But my father
and brothers example taught me never
to depend on a man

A beat
AIKEN

How long did you know Lt Wiechmann
was working for the Confederacy

ANNA
A while And he didnt work hard
enough

AIKEN
Excuse me

ANNA

Lou was too much of a coward to devote
himself to the Cause Thats why
Id never consider marrying him

AIKEN
He proposed to you

ANNA
Dont seem so surprised by the notion
Mr Aiken Fact is I was in love
with a man -- not a boy Lt
Wiechmann didnt like that

AIKEN
You really think thats why he
testified against your mother

ANNA
For it is written vengeance is mine

AIKEN
Any other Louis Wiechmanns I need to
be prepared for

Anna atop the ladder turns and catches Aikens eye wandering
up the back of her skirt

ANNA
Are you more interested in me or
defending my mother Colonel

AIKEN
Im interested in the truth Starting
with wheres your brother

ANNA
I dont have the slightest idea

AIKEN
Then perhaps youll level with me
about what I can expect next at trial

Several beats ensue

AIKEN (CONTD)
Youre going to have to learn to
depend on me Miss Surratt

Anna thinks on it

Finally she descends the ladder She gestures Aiken into
the PARLOR -- the exact spot where Booth and the others met
As Anna and Aiken begin to go over the case we CUT TO --

HOLT (0S)

-Let us proceed with events
immediately following the
assassination of President Lincoln

PULL BACK INT ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT MORNING
MAJOR HW SMITH precise in manner and response fills the
WITNESS BOX (The Major was seen earlier reporting to Stanton
immediately after the assassination) The prosecutor HOLT
is beside him as the case against Mary Surratt continues
HOLT
Major Smith what were your duties
that night
MAJOR SMITH
I was charged with finding John
Surratt
INT SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - PARLOR -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A DOZEN POLICEMEN ransack the house flipping over furniture
paintings and rugs A PATROLMAN approaches Major Smith

PATROLMAN 1
No sign of the son

PATROLMAN 2 comes down the stairs

PATROLMAN 2
Major take a look

He hands the Major a stack of card-sized PICTURES

PATROLMAN
We found these upstairs in the
daughters bedroom

Pointing at Anna Surratt still in her nightshirt Louis
Wiechmann is nearby looking fearful

INSERT Each IMAGE as the Major flips through them

-- First a half-dozen DAGUERREOTYPES of CONFEDERATE GENERALS
including pictures of Generals Lee Beauregard and Jackson

-- Then a PRINTED CARD featuring the seal of the state of
Virginia with Confederate flags

-- And lastly a color LITHOGRAPH of a nursery fable titled
Morning Noon and Night

The Major examines the fable more closely He flips it over
revealing a PHOTO on the reverse side of JOHN WILKES BOOTH

MAJOR SMITH
Young lady does this belong to you

Mary shields her daughter

MARY
This young lady belongs to me

PRESENT TIME INT COURTROOM --
Holt holds up the CARD baring the Virginia state seal
HOLT
Major Please read aloud whats
inscribed here

The Major positions his reading glasses

MAJOR SMITH
Sic semper tyrannis

HOLT
Can you translate

MAJOR SMITH
Of course Thus always for tyrants

HOLT
Are these words familiar to you

MAJOR SMITH
Indeed Booth yelled them after he
butchered our President

HOLT
And you found the same -- just an
hour later -- in her daughters

bedroom next to a photo of the
assassin himself

MAJOR SMITH
Like a shrine sir

AIKEN
Thats preposterous Sic semper
tyrannis is the state motto of
Virginia This is hardly proof of a
shrine to Booth

General Hunter interjects with contempt

GENERAL HUNTER
No more proof is needed Colonel

Aiken is stunned silent

HOLT
Major Smith please tell us what
happened next

MAJOR SMITH
As I was fixin to take the Surratts
down to headquarters for questioning
I heard a commotion outside

--The sound of several men SHOUTING

INT SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Major Smith draws his gun before opening the back door
Lewis Payne (Booths TALL ASSOCIATE who attacked the

Secretary of State) is standing in the doorway

Payne is sweating profusely -- like the fugitive he is --
with PICKAXE in hand He is surrounded by TWO SOLDIERS

SOLDIER 1
We found him sneaking around outside

PAYNE
I told these imbeciles a lady inside
asked me to dig a gutter for her

MAJOR SMITH
At this time of night

PAYNE
In the morning I just wanted to
know what time I should start
Major Smith turns to Anna who is watching from the doorway

MAJOR SMITH
Is this true

Anna says nothing Major Smith calls into the PARLOR

MAJOR SMITH (CONTD)
Mrs Surratt Come here a moment

Major Smith spots BLOODSTAINS on the back of Paynes sleeve
He takes the pickaxe from his hand
MAJOR SMITH (CONTD)
Did you hire this gentleman to do a
job for you

MARY
Absolutely not Ive never seen him
before in all my life

PRESENT TIME INT COURTROOM --
Holt stands beside Lewis Payne at the prisoners dock

HOLT
Is this man Lewis Payne the one
she denied knowing

MAJOR SMITH
Yes sir

HOLT
The same man who has confessed to
boarding at the Surratts several
times -- prior to daggerin the
Secretary of State and his kin

MAJOR SMITH
Yes

HOLT
Thank you Major Nothing further

Holt sits down triumphantly Aiken rises

AIKEN
Are you aware Mr Payne boarded at
the Surratts under an alias claiming
to be a Baptist minister from
Baltimore named Wood

MAJOR SMITH
Thats what she claimed

AIKEN
Supposing it was the truth Supposing
Mrs Surratt simply failed that night
to recognize Wood the preacher in
the guise of Payne the ditch digger

MAJOR SMITH
Not possible He stood barely two
paces in front of her

Aiken pulls a LETTER from his briefcase

AIKEN
Your honor I present the court with
a notarized letter from Dr Sanford
Wilkerson a well respected
optometrist in town

Aiken presents the letter to General Hunter
AIKEN (CONTD)
Mary Surratt has been a patient under
his care for the past six years
suffering from severe presbyopia --
more commonly known as farsightedness

General Hunter examines the letter But not before
to put on a pair of READING GLASSES himself

AIKEN (CONTD)
Major Smith it was late at night
The defendant was dressed for sleep
Isnt it possible she merely had
trouble seeing him

MAJOR SMITH
Well I uh

AIKEN
A simple yes or no

MAJOR SMITH
Yes its possibleI suppose

AIKEN
So its also possible you -- or
rather we -- might also be wrongfully

accusing her of disloyalty too
Major Smith holds up the daguerreotypes

MAJOR SMITH
I think these more than indicate her
allegiances Colonel

AIKEN
Have you not seen the like in stores
around town

MAJOR SMITH
Yes of course but

AIKEN
So do you intend to arrest me too

Aiken presents to the Court an identical set

AIKEN (CONTD)
Whats next Rounding up everyone
whose name rhymes with General Lee

Several laugh aloud including Baker and Catherine

MAJOR SMITH
Course not

AIKEN
Then I dare say we ought to presume
the accused is innocent unless we
have proof beyond a reasonable doubt
(MORE )

having

AIKEN (CONTD)
(a beat)
A thirst for vengeance Major is
not enough to avenge this crime

Even Hamilton has to admire Aikens commanding presence
INT REVERDY JOHNSONS HOME -- LATER THAT EVENING
Reverdy Johnson is eating his supper ALONE

The doorbell rings A STEWARD goes to answer the door
Reverdy calls out

REVERDY JOHNSON
Ill take the transcript in here

MANS VOICE (0S)
Sure you dont want me to read it
aloud

Reverdy instantly recognizes the voice looks up Its
STANTON He hands Reverdy the transcript

STANTON
Youre associate is putting up quite
a spirited defense Reminds me of a
lawyer I faced 35 years ago

REVERDY JOHNSON
He learned to fight in your army

STANTON
Our young men certainly have been
through four years of hell

REVERDY JOHNSON
And we older ones better ensure it
was worth the fight

STANTON
Reverdy youve done as much for our
nation as anyone I know

REVERDY JOHNSON
Feelings mutual Ed

STANTON
Dont you think its time us war
horses called a truce

REVERDY JOHNSON
Not if you insist on staging this
abomination

STANTON
What you consider an ‘abomination
will do more to keep the peace than
any paper treaty could

REVERDY JOHNSON
Howd you convince yourself of that

STANTON
Because it will deter the South from
conspiring again And discourage
the North from seeking revenge

REVERDY JOHNSON
What about the rule of law

STANTON
For Gods sake weve never known an
enemy like this They enjoy our
freedom at the same time they plot
to destroy us Your actions only
serve to aid them -- by eroding our
unity and diminishing our resolve

REVERDY JOHNSON
By abandoning our laws we become
just like them

Stanton begins to leave

STANTON

You may prefer eating alone Senator
But do you really want the Colonel
doing so the rest of his life

(a beat)
If he continues this way this case
will destroy him You know Im right
about this

Off Reverdy Johnson taking this in
BAKER (0S)
So this one time we were surrounded
by a rebel column
PULL BACK INT PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM -- SAME
Aiken is seated at an elegant DINING TABLE surrounded by

friends -- notably Baker and Hamilton Catherine is across
from Aiken Baker is mid-story

BAKER
Their General yells out I demand
you surrender immediately Well

Freddie shouts back My compliments
General But we dont surrender

All eyes are once again on Aiken

BAKER (CONTD)
Hope you said your prayers the
General replies Cause theyre 400
of us And only 100 of you

Aiken pretends not to revel in the attention

BAKER (CONTD)
Heck weve got less than that
Freddie hollers back

(MORE )

BAKER (CONTD)
But we dont surrender So shut
up and come get some And with
that Freddie pulls down his pants
and bares his ass

FEMALE GUEST
No he didnt

BAKER
As the moon is my witness

Laughter

FEMALE GUEST 2
So did they come

Hamilton jealously glares at his date

BAKER

Six times And each time the General
shouts out I wont ask you again
Now surrender at once

(a beat)
Pray dont Freddie shouts back
For we never surrender And then
he blows a tremendous fart in their
direction

FEMALE GUEST 3
He didnt

BAKER
His seventh was so deadly it sent
them runnin for their lives
The TABLE erupts in laughter
CATHERINE
Doesnt seem like the Colonel ever
intends to surrender

BAKER
Only for the right woman

Baker smiles reassuringly at Catherine

HAMILTON
Appears the Colonel has surrendered
to one -- shes fair fit and 45
AIKEN

I dont see why the Lieutenant insists
on bringing his mother into this

More laughter Hamilton seethes Baker attempts to pacify

BAKER
Freddie why dont you tell us what
your conspirator is really like
Im sure wed all like to know

FEMALE GUEST 1
(contemptuous ly)
I understand shes a Catholic

FEMALE GUEST 2
Is it true she wears black from head-
to-toe as if shes in mourning

AIKEN
Perhaps by papal decree

HAMILTON
How did you do it Fred

AIKEN
How did I do what

HAMILTON
Destroy that Major on cross like
that The doctors letter the
postcards You didnt bluff your
way through this one

As Baker raises his artificial leg --

BAKER
My legs falling asleep Lets go
dance

HAMILTON

You knew what was coming didnt
you Fred Those meetings with the
Surratt girl seem to be paying off

An awkward silence Baker glances at Catherine

BAKER
Are you through Bill
(Hamilton says nothing)
Good Now lets dance

Baker rises The others follow suit We HOLD ON Aiken and
Catherine -- still seated

--Gradually PIANO MUSIC begins to fill the room
PULL BACK INT SALON -- LATER

As Baker is now at a piano playingsinging The Children
of the Battle Field He has a sonorous voice But only
Aiken is around to hear it

BAKER
Upon the Field of Gettysburg
The full moon slowly rose
She looked and saw 10000 brows
All pale in deaths repose

Baker continues singing as Aiken is deep in thought and wine
Catherine enters the room
CATHERINE
If I had known it was a wake Id
have dressed more appropriately

Aiken turns to take in Catherines floral dress

AIKEN
Youre the vision of perfection
Catherine

CATHERINE

You lie pass gas and never surrender
Quite a catch

(a beat)
Why defend her Freddie

AIKEN
Not you too Catherine

CATHERINE
Is it because of Senator Johnson I
know your father and he were very
close But you dont owe it to either
of them

AIKEN
Of course not

CATHERINE
Does it have to do with Anna Surratt

Aiken is taken aback

AIKEN
Bill is an ass

CATHERINE
I understand shes very beautiful

AIKEN
Catherine please

CATHERINE
I accepted not hearing from you for
18 months The front mustve been
horrible But I will not accept
your silence on why youre defending
her

AIKEN
I dont know
(off her skepticism)
Honestly Catherine I dont

Catherine can see Aiken means it A beat

CATHERINE
Just one more thing

AIKEN
Youre the one who doesnt
surrender What What do you

need to know

CATHERINE
Does the Colonel still remember how
to dance

They exchange looks

He holds out his hand She takes it Baker starts to play

a slow waltz on the piano With each turn across the floor
the distance between Aiken and Catherine becomes less

Aiken inhales Catherines scent as she grasps his shoulder
His eyes begin to fall to half-staff His head rests against
hers It looks as if Aiken is finally going to surrender
Suddenly he pulls away

CATHERINE (CONTD)
What is it

AIKEN

Theres something I need to ask you
CATHERINE

Of course Freddie You can ask me

anything
Off Catherine waiting expectantly
AIKEN (0S)
I want you to wear this in court
today
PULL BACK INT MARYS CELL -- NEXT MORNING

As Aiken presents Mary with Catherines floral DRESS Mary
doesnt take it

MARY
I want the truth from you this time

Aiken knows exactly what shes after

AIKEN
Anna never went missing

MARY
Shes been helping you all along

Aiken nods

MARY (CONTD)
How could you lie to me about such a
thing

AIKEN
I needed to know the truth about
your son

MARY
Nothing they do to me could compare
to the torture of not knowing my
daughter was ok

AIKEN
Im sorry

Aiken pulls out NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from his briefcase

MARY
Please leave

AIKEN (CONTD)

(veads from a clipping)
Mrs Surratt looks no less masculine
than the male prisoners on trial --
removing any doubt a woman like her
could be capable of such a crime

(re other clippings)
The others are less kind

Aiken holds out the dress Mary refuses it

MARY
It matters none to me what they think

AIKEN
It matters to me This country has
never executed a woman We need
those Generals to begin seeing their
own wives in you

Mary grimaces momentarily but conceals it from Aiken

MARY

You speak of womanhood with such
reverence Mr Aiken Yet we arent
trusted enough to vote while a former
slave now can as long as he has 250

(heavy Southern drawl)
Yes Im certain yall would prefer
I acted like a good Southern lady
Met my fate in that pretty dress
with a painted face But Id prefer
to act naturally And take the
consequences like a man

AIKEN
Please Maam Wear the dress
smile at those Generals and pray
they show you some mercy

Mary holds a beat She starts undressing in front of Aiken

AIKEN (CONTD)
What are you doing

MARY
Just obeying orders Colonel

She drops her black dress to the floor Starts unlacing her
corset She is now standing in a calf-length chemise She
slips off her pantalettes and tosses it into the bucket

MARY (CONTD)
Come now Freddie dont be shy
Surely youve undressed a woman

AIKEN
Youre insane

Mary presses up against Aiken seductively

MARY
Im just showing you how Id please
those Generals

AIKEN
Stop it

Aiken pushes Mary to the ground just as her son did at the
boardinghouse But this time Mary doesnt get up

AIKEN (CONTD)
Maam
(no response)
Maam Are you alright

Aiken spots her chemise in the bucket stained BLOOD RED
Aiken calls out

AIKEN (CONTD)
Call a doctor

Mary remains crumpled clutching her belly

AIKEN (CONTD)
Call a doctor NOW

-A door marked SECRETARY of WAR
PULL BACK INT WAR DEPT - STANTONS OFFICE -- LATER
An AIDE intercepts Aiken outside Secretary Stantons door
STANTONS AIDE
Im sorry sir No one sees Mr
Stanton without an appointment
Joseph Holt emerges from inside
HOLT
Good morning Colonel Perhaps I
can be of assistance
AIKEN
If you can arrange a meeting for me

with the Secretary My client is
not well

HOLT
So I heard Just a touch of the
womans curse thank goodness Shell
be well enough to continue with her
trial within a few days In the
meantime well pursue our case
against the other Conspirators

AIKEN
My client requires a proper meal and
some fresh air Otherwise I can
not assure you shell be fit for
trial Which is why I must see the
Secretary -- immediately

HOLT
Unfortunately hes quite busy right
now Perhaps youd take a turn
with me instead

Aiken hesitates

HOLT (CONTD)
Please Colonel

Aiken reluctantly follows Holt outside
EXT PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Holt continue their conversation across swampy
Pennsylvania Avenue The WHITE HOUSE looms in the background

HOLT
One of the Conspirators refuses to
be guarded by a Negro Another will
only eat his mothers cooking We
cant accommodate every whim

AIKEN
Im merely asking you stop treating
her like a savage

HOLT
How dare you accuse US of savagery

An AMPUTEE crosses in front of Holt and Aikens path

HOLT (CONTD)
Have you forgotten how our own were
treated by the rebels Thousands
starved to death at Andersonville
Not to mention the horrors for those
held at Libby and Liggetts Farm

AIKEN
It hardly enhances our cause to act
as the enemy would

HOLT
Security demands it
AIKEN
Mary Surratt is not a present danger
I assure you

HOLT
Can you say the same about her
daughter

AIKEN

Anna Surratt Of course But Im
sure youve been tracking her every
move

HOLT
Not well enough She disappeared
last night

AIKEN
What Where is she

HOLT
I thought you might know

AIKEN
I have no idea

HOLT
Then I can only conclude she does
not wish to be found -- much like
her brother

Both men pass inside the prestigious CENTURY CLUB
INT CENTURY CLUB - STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS
As Aiken and Holt continue up the Clubs GRAND STAIRCASE

HOLT
--Counselor I appreciate your zeal
in defending your client But I
hardly think it prudent to do so at
your own peril

AIKEN
Peril

HOLT
You exhibit a bright future dear
boy Dont dim it by mounting
unnecessary campaigns

AIKEN
You offer me no other alternative

Holt freezes makes certain NO ONE else is listening
HOLT
I think I know a way to save both
your client -- and yourself

A beat

HOLT (CONTD)
Ill deny ever telling you this
Understood

Off Aiken nodding
EXT COURTYARD US ARSENAL PRISON -- LATE AFTERNOON
A beautiful late Spring day

Aiken spots Mary across the open-air courtyard She has
made a swift recovery -- exercising in the sunlight her
arms now free of chains She is wearing the dress given to
her by Aiken the plunging neckline tempered by a shawl

Father Walter passes Aiken after having prayed with Mary

AIKEN
Good Morning Father

FATHER WALTER
Colonel

Aiken approaches Mary tentatively

MARY

You shouldve pushed me down a month
ago if thats what it took to spell
me from that cage Feel that sun
Now all I need is a few boiled
oysters with Spanish olives

(giddy )
Your mama ever boil oysters for you
Frederick

Aiken is taken aback by Marys use of his first name
AIKEN

No maam I never had the good
fortune to taste my mothers cooking

MARY
She doesnt cook
AIKEN
She passed when I was born
MARY
I feel for your loss -- and hers

(a beat)
Some day Ill make oysters for you --
with Spanish olives of course You
must never eat em without the olives

AIKEN
I look forward to it

Aiken struggles for the right words

AIKEN (CONTD)
Mary I uh
MARY
Young man I dont believe Ive seen
you at a loss for words

Aiken comes right out with it

AIKEN
Do you know where your son is hiding

MARY
(laughs)
My Johnnie Course not

AIKEN
The government believes you do
That youre in contact

MARY
From here
AIKEN
Maam you need to tell us where he
is
MARY
US Whose side are you on
AIKEN

Im trying to save your life

MARY
By suggesting I trade my sons life
for my own Seems more like youre
trying to save yourself

AIKEN
How dare you You think I asked to
defend you

MARY
Course not But every time you
walk out those gates something pulls
you back inside Well if youre
looking to slip out the back door
youll have to unlock it yourself
Because I have no idea where my son
is hiding

AIKEN
How about your daughter

MARY
Youve already played that card Mr
Aiken Now if you please I wish
to enjoy the rest of this glorious
day There may not be many more
left

Mary resumes her exercises

AIKEN (OS)
Are you absolutely certain

PULL BACK INT CAPITOL -- REVERDYS OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
As Aiken now confers with Reverdy Johnson

REVERDY JOHNSON
The Secretary assures me they dont

have her

AIKEN
Anna chose to flee Why would she
do that

REVERDY JOHNSON
Perhaps shes as guilty as her
brother

AIKEN
Do you believe that

REVERDY JOHNSON
It matters none Fact is with two
children abandoning Mrs Surratt
itll only be seen one way -- their
mother must be guilty

AIKEN
I think Mary may be innocent

REVERDY JOHNSON
Is that so Well Mary and Anna
theyre my concern now Your wish
is granted Fred Im taking you
off the case

Reverdy rises heads for the door
INT AIKENS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Aiken chases after Reverdy

AIKEN
But you said I had to prove her
guilty

REVERDY JOHNSON
You havent proven shes not

AIKEN
So you dont think Im up to the
task of defending her

REVERDY JOHNSON
Quite the contrary I just think
its best for all concerned that I
take over from here

AIKEN
But your presence in that courtroom
will antagonize those generals You
said so yourself

REVERDY JOHNSON
I can manage

But Aiken soon realizes Reverdy isnt only referring to the
case as hes just followed his boss inside the --

WATER CLOSET --
Embarrassed Aiken quickly exits Reverdy closes the door

REVERDY JOHNSON (0S)
(calls out)

Few will soon forget on whose side

you fought here Fred Trust me

its a lonely place to be

AIKEN
(calls back)
Sir a man must be willing to walk
on faith alone You said so yourself

REVERDY JOHNSON
This habit of quoting me back to me
is most irritating

Flush Reverdy reemerges from the water closet

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Youve got your mothers conviction
And your fathers annoying habits

Reverdy returns to his office with Aiken in tow
INT REVERDYS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

AIKEN

With all due respect I never knew
my mother And my father only through
his books So the only bad habits
I picked up are from you -- sir

(a beat)
Mary Surratt is entitled to a defense
So I shall defend her

Reverdy thinks on it

REVERDY JOHNSON
Are you sure you want this

AIKEN
Unfortunately Yes

REVERDY JOHNSON

Very well Fred
(another beat)

So tell me how do you intend to
convince the Generals shes innocent
after they hear she was carrying a
package from Booth -- just hours
before he murdered Lincoln

AIKEN
According to her daughter she was
merely returning a favor to Booth

REVERDY JOHNSON
Dr Mudd did Booth a favor by fixin
his broken leg Now hes facing
life in prison Edward Spangler
held Booths horse outside Fords
Theater and is looking at hard labor
So dont do your client any favors
by offering that as a defense

AIKEN
What do you suggest I do

REVERDY JOHNSON
If its John Surratt they want then
present him to those Generals on a
platter Its the only chance shes
got

AIKEN
How I havent a clue where he is
And if all the resources of the
Government cant find him I hardly
think I will by hours end

REVERDY JOHNSON

I dont mean in body -- in spirit
You must prove to them her son is
responsible -- not her

AIKEN

Mary wont like it She insists on
leaving him out of it

REVERDY JOHNSON
Better to hate you alive than love
you from the grave

A long beat as we CUT TO --
FULL SCREEN on an ARTISTs SKETCH of the next WITNESS
PULL BACK INT US ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT DAY

As we reveal the SKETCH is being drawn by a member of the
Military Commission -- GENERAL LEWIS WALLACE (Note General
Wallace is perpetually sketching throughout the trial)

HOLT
Mr Lloyd you are employed by Mary

JOHN LLOYD 54 rotund and ruddy-cheeked wears a Panama
hat white suit and as many folds on the back of his red
neck as around his waist

LLOYD
Yes sir I run a tavern started by
her late husband many years ago

Aiken looks over at Mary She looks away

was assassinated did Mrs Surratt
pay you a visit

The Gallery begins to stir
HOLT

From Booth And what exactly did
she give you

AIKEN
Objection

HOLT
Objection

AIKEN

Yes Theres no proof the defendant
knew herself He just testified the
package was wrapped

HOLT
She damn well handed it to him
AIKEN
Mr Booth was friends with John
Surratt -- not the defendant

Mary glares at Aiken
GENERAL HUNTER
Objection overruled The witness
will answer the question

HOLT
Mr Lloyd what was inside

LLOYD
Field glasses sir

HOLT
Are these the ones

Holt holds up a pair of BINOCULARS Lloyd inspects them

LLOYD
Xactly
HOLT
Did she give you any instructions
LLOYD
Sir
HOLT

Instructions Mr Lloyd Instructions
which might affect this trial

The QUESTION puzzles both Aiken and Mary Lloyd reacts to
instruction as though it were a CODE

LLOYD
Oh yesyes sir
(as if memorized)
She told me Lloyd get those
shooting irons ready Therell be
parties here tonight wholl call for
them

MARY
You liar

Mary screams out General Hunter slams his gavel
GENERAL HUNTER
Control yourself maam Such
outbursts will only prejudice your
case

Mary guffaws

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)
You find that amusing

MARY
I just dont see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case

GENERAL HUNTER
Counselor control your client

Aiken turns to Mary But he too can barely contain his
own amusement at Marys quip They share a quick smile

HOLT
Shooting irons To what was she
referring

LLOYD

Army rifles sir Hidden in the
joists above my storeroom

HOLT
By whom

LLOYD
By her son John Six weeks earlier

Lloyd glares over at Mary

HOLT
And were these weapons called for as
per the defendants instructions

LLOYD
Yes sir Around midnight sir the
night of the assassination By two
men on horses One of ‘em Id seen
before

Lloyd points at DAVID HEROLD 22 inside the prisoners dock
Herold bows his head

LLOYD (CONTD)
--The other kept his mount He was
a stranger to me and seemed to have
injured his leg

EXT TAVERN -- MIDNIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Booth with a broken ankle remains atop his HORSE outside
Lloyds tavern His identity is concealed behind his collar

Herold dismounts from his ride and follows Lloyd inside

LLOYD (VO)
I fetched the rifles and field
glasses supposing they were the
parties Mrs Surratt had meant

Herold returns moments later with the SUPPLIES in hand

LLOYD (VO)
The two of ‘em rode off so fast
they couldve outrun creation and
give it two mile the start
Booth and Herold race into the night
PRESENT TIME INT COURTROOM --

HOLT
Thank you Mr Lloyd Thank you
very much Your witness Colonel

Holt returns to his seat a smug grin on his face

AIKEN
Mr Lloyd you just testified Lt
Wiechmann accompanied the defendant
that afternoon

LLOYD
Thats right

AIKEN
So then I can correctly assume hed
also testify to having heard Mrs
Surratts instructions to you

LLOYD
No

AIKEN
No But they were seated side by
side

LLOYD

She took me out by the wood pile and
told me out of earshot

AIKEN
Youre saying no one else heard this
conversation Just you and her

LLOYD
Thats just the way it happened
Sir

AIKEN

Of course it is
Aiken and Holt exchange glances

AIKEN (CONTD)
When did you first learn the President
had been assassinated Mr Lloyd

LLOYD
No one will ever forget the moment
they heard I was told early the
next morning by a Captain Cottingham
who was searching for the assassins

AIKEN
No doubt you were most upset
LLOYD
Indeed I got myself right smart in
liquor the remainder of the day

AIKEN
In fact youre right smart most
days Arent you mate

LLOYD
I enjoy a round or two

AIKEN
You shared a few with the defendants
late husband isnt that right

LLOYD
Every now and again

AIKEN
You were fond of him werent you

LLOYD
He was always good for a laugh

AIKEN
And for overlooking a debt

LLOYD
We had an understanding

AIKEN
Which you and the defendant dont
In fact the day she and Mr Wiechmann
visited the tavern Mrs Surratt
inquired about a significant sum you
owed her late husband Isnt that
correct

LLOYD
Yeah so

AIKEN
So you have a financial stake in
the outcome of this trial

LLOYD
If youre suggesting I aim to profit
from our Presidents death Ive got
a good mind to put you in the ground

AIKEN
Your words Mr Lloyd not mine

Lloyd stands up as if hes going to attack Aiken

HOLT
Objection This courageous witness
is a former policeman He deserves
our gratitude not unfounded
accusations

GENERAL HUNTER
Sustained Mr Aiken show the
witness some respect

AIKEN
Yes General Thank you Mr Lloyd
Were all so indebted to you
(a beat)
May I continue your honor

General Hunter nods

GENERAL HUNTER
Please be seated Mr Lloyd

Lloyd does as told Reverdy enters the back of the courtroom

AIKEN
Mr Lloyd when this Captain
Cottingham visited you after the
assassination did he ask anything
in reference to the assassins

LLOYD
He asked if any parties had passed
through Naturally I told them
about the two I knew

Aiken withdraws a document from his files

AIKEN
According to this witness report
you didnt actually inform him until
two days later

LLOYD
I was frightened is all

AIKEN
Perhaps you feared you might be
considered an accessory

LLOYD
I told him it was through the Surratts
that Id gotten myself in such a
difficulty

AIKEN
John Surratt to be more precise
After all hes the one who concealed
those shooting irons inside your
tavern months earlier Not you

LLOYD
Thats right

AIKEN
Perhaps he threatened to foreclose
on your tavern if you refused

Lloyd looks confused Mary leans forward in her chair
AIKEN (CONTD)
Were those John Surratts
instructions to you

LLOYD
(getting Aikens gist)
Yes exactly He said hed take it
away from me if I didnt do what he
said

HOLT
Objection Theres no evidence John
Surratt did anything of the sort
And since Mr Surratts whereabouts
are unknown at this time --

AIKEN
-- As the General said Mr Surratts
absence from this proceeding is Mr
Surratts problem

By quoting Hunters own words hes forced his hand --

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection overruled

AIKEN
So if John Surratt could implicate
a dear friend of his fathers like
yourself whos to say he didnt do
the same to his own mother as well

Mary lunges at the rail

MARY

Stop this Stop this right now
HOLT

Objection
AIKEN

Or that the only crime Mary Surratt
may be guilty of is having given
birth to her son John

MARY
How dare you You have no right

General Hunter bangs his gavel repeatedly

HOLT
Objection your honor This is an
outrage

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection sustained Mr Aiken Im
warning you

AIKEN
But sir --

GENERAL HUNTER
That will be all counselor

One of the MEMBERS of the COMMISSION points to his WATCH
General Hunter takes it as a CUE and abruptly changes course

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)
As you know tonight marks
Washingtons celebration honoring
our soldiers We shall adjourn now
to prepare our faces for this
evenings festivities Mr Lloyd
you may step down

Lloyd exits the WITNESS BOX very satisfied with himself
Aiken says to Lloyd under his breath --

AIKEN
So what did they promise you

HOLT
Objection your honor

GENERAL HUNTER AIKEN
Counselor control Bet a case of whiskey is
yourself all it took

Aiken and Lloyd begin to square off as if to fight

GENERAL HUNTER
Control yourself Or I will hold
you in contempt

A BAILIFF steps between Aiken and Lloyd quickly escorting
the latter outside General Hunter slams his gavel

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)

Well reconvene promptly at 0900
(to Aiken)

And when we do young man youd
better comport yourself in a more
appropriate manner Or else youll
find yourself in the brig alongside
the others

Hunter slams his gavel Holt looks at Aiken as if to say
youre playing with fire Mary glares at him with contempt

Reverdy Johnson looks distressed for Aiken Theres no
turning back now

FIREWORKS explode into the NIGHT SKY
PULL BACK EXT WASHINGTON CITY -- NIGHT

The NATIONS CAPITAL consumed in CELEBRATION its MONUMENTS
bathed in light We HOLD ON a BANNER that reads

The Century Club

OUR FIGHTING HEROES

PULL BACK INT CENTURY CLUB - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

GUESTS pass beneath the banner on their way to the grand
ballroom upstairs WALTZ music filters down from above

The Century Club is filled with the POWERS-THAT-BE and POWERS-
TO-BE mostly attired in their finest military dress

Aiken enters quite dapper in his dress whites Eager for a
festive night-on-the-town Catherine is on his arm

They pass the Club Steward OTIS on his way upstairs

AIKENCATHERINE
Good evening Otis

OTIS
Evenin Colonel Miss Morgan

Suddenly Otis expression changes from welcome to alarm

OTIS (CONTD)
Just a minute Colonel Aiken Can I
have a word

Otis ushers Aiken out of Catherines earshot

OTIS (CONTD)
Theyre tellin me I aint allowed
to let you in there

AIKEN
What are you talking about

As Catherine waits patiently she spots a BULLETIN BOARD
posted nearby

DEAR MEMBERS

Reverend Peale has agreed to
--Construction will begin on

Finally SETTLING on

The membership of MR FREDERICK AIKEN

as a result of conduct unbecoming

Suddenly the sound of LAUGHTER -- Hamilton with beauty in
tow and Baker arriving Aiken turns to Baker

AIKEN (CONTD)
Nick would you please take Catherine
inside for me

BAKER
Is everything alright

AIKEN
Everythings fine Ill join you as

Enjoy the evening Gentleman

Aiken turns and heads for the door Baker extends his arm

BAKER
Even on one I can outdance him

CATHERINE
And one less foot for me to step on
Another night Nick

Catherine kisses Baker on the cheek and heads for the door

OTIS
Shall I call you a carriage Miss
Morgan

CATHERINE

Thank you Otis
Hamilton calls out
HAMILTON
Sure you dont want to join us
Catherine

She turns and glares at Hamilton And heads out the door
without answering

EXT CENTURY CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

Catherine exits Otis motions for a carriage to pull forward
Aiken suddenly appears

AIKEN
Ive got it Otis

Aiken helps Catherine into the CARRIAGE

CATHERINE
I saw the announcement

AIKEN
Ill take care of it in the morning
Im sorry about this evening
Tears begin to fill her eyes

CATHERINE
Im sorry too

She slips off her engagement ring and returns it to Aiken
The Carriage rides off Aiken is now the outsider and ALONE

--A flash of LIGHTNING

PULL BACK EXT WASHINGTON CITY - STREET -- LATER

As BOLTS now light up the sky replacing the fireworks
They illuminate Aiken who walks alone in a torrential RAIN

A THUNDERCLAP echoes overhead A UNION BAND marches past
joyfully playing Yankee Doodle in the downpour

Aiken is forlorn and soaking wet He spots a PUB ahead --
THE BLUE GOOSE and OYSTER BAR -- and quickly ducks inside

INT BLUE GOOSE SALOON and OYSTER BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken enters the pub which is filled with a much ROUGHER
CROWD than the upper crust at the Century Club gala

All eyes seem to follow him as he removes his drenched Union
coat and settles on a stool at the end of the bar

AIKEN
Whiskey

BARTENDER
Got none

AIKEN

How ‘bout that bottle over there
Aiken points to a WHISKEY BOTTLE three-quarters full

BARTENDER
I dont want no trouble Colonel

He gestures to the PATRONS all fixed on Aiken A BLOCK-
HEAD leans in from Aikens right glaring at Aikens uniform

BLOCK-HEAD
(southern accent)
Yanks aint welcome here

Several MORE TOUGHS now circle behind Theres no mistaking
now this is a Rebel bar

Nervously Aiken rises to leave A BARREL-CHEST blocks him
BARREL-CHEST
Youre the one defending that Surratt
women arent you

Aiken nods as he prepares for the worst

BARTENDER
Why didnt you say so

Suddenly the entire pub descends upon Aiken But instead
of attacking him theyre hailing Aiken like a hero

HOLD ON Aikens expression registering his DISMAY

CUT TO

INT AIKENS RESIDENCE -- A SHORT TIME LATER
Aiken stumbles home dripping wet and drunk

He crosses inside his modest flat -- legal briefs army
mementoes and dirty clothes are strewn about

Framed DAGUERREOTYPES fill his mantel including one of a
young woman (Aikens MOTHER) A closer look reveals shes
inside a coffin her death portrait Another image is of a
young Aiken with his very formal-looking FATHER A portrait
of PRESIDENT LINCOLN is the last photo shown

Aikens windows are also broken like Annas -- a ROCK pile
is on the sill One is inscribed DIE REBEL DIE

Aiken begins removing his soggy clothes to prepare for sleep --
suddenly a HAND grabs his bare shoulder from behind

Aiken whirls takes the attackers feet out from under him
knocks him to the ground and pins himpins HER

FAMILIAR VOICE (0S)
Frederick stop Its me

As we reveal ANNA SURRATT with Aiken straddling her one
hand to her throat another raised to strike

AIKEN
What the hell

Aiken now suddenly sober relaxes his grip

ANNA
Shes very beautiful
(Off Aikens confusion)
I saw you go in your club tonight

Aiken rolls off of Anna
AIKEN
Anna They think youre as guilty
as your brother Where have you
been
A long beat Then softly --

ANNA
You still want to know where he is

Another beat
AIKEN
You dont have to do this No one
should have to choose between their
mother and their brother

ANNA
I found out how

Aiken cuts her off

AIKEN
Please I never shouldve put you
in this position Im so sorry

ANNA
Can you save my mother without him
(no reply)
Can you Fred

A long pause

AIKEN
Probably not

Annas eyes fill with tears Aiken desperately wants to
comfort her She desperately wants to be comforted Instead
she hands him a NOTE and flees Off Aikens turmoil

--A splash of WATER
PULL BACK INT CATHEDRAL -- EARLY MORNING MASS

As we reveal a BABY being BAPTIZED Proud PARENTS and
GRANDPARENTS surround a PRIEST performing the ritual bath

Aiken watches the tender scene from a rear pew

The Priest his identity still obscured passes the Infant
off to an ASSOCIATE then exits through a side door

Aiken follows behind

AIKEN (0S)
Im told you know the whereabouts of
John Surratt

PULL BACK INT CHAPEL ANNEX -- MOMENTS LATER

The Priests identity is now revealed -- FATHER JACOB WALTER
(the Cleric twice shown visiting Mary in jail) Aiken shows
him the note on Annas stationary with Walters name on it

FATHER WALTER
Youve been misinformed

AIKEN
I need to see him right away

FATHER WALTER
Not possible Colonel As I told
Miss Surratt I can only pass along
a message We believe it safer for
everyone concerned

AIKEN
We

Father Walter pinches his clerics COLLAR
FATHER WALTER

A few of us have chosen to provide
him sanctuary
AIKEN
You dont seem troubled by your
choice

FATHER WALTER
You prefer he too be crucified by
this mob

AIKEN
Crucified

Aikens loud exclamation brings one of Father Walters
ASSOCIATES to the CHAPEL DOOR Aiken lowers his voice

AIKEN (CONTD)
John Surratt is hardly the Prince
of Peace Hes accused of murder
and treason Concealing him is not
only immoral Father its illegal

FATHER WALTER
(clutching a Bible)
My laws are written here counselor
My allegiance to God

AIKEN
Forgive me Father but thats a
bunch of cock-and-bull The Bible
bears just as many interpretations
as does anything else It does not
give you the authority to decide
right from wrong

FATHER WALTER
You prefer Stanton having the power
instead

A beat

FATHER WALTER (CONTD)
I will pass along a message Colonel
But John Surratt alone will choose
whether or not to turn himself in

Off Father Walter
GENERAL HUNTER (0S)
Colonel Aiken do you wish to call a
witness in defense of the accused

PULL BACK INT PRISON - COURTROOM -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

The courtroom is sweltering like an inferno Many fan
themselves with little relief

AIKEN
Yes your honor I do Will Miss
Anna Surratt please step forward

Anna Surratt enters the courtroom

As Anna is seated inside the WITNESS BOX she gets her first
glimpse of her mother nearly moving both to tears

Aiken sensing Anna is coming apart steps near Just as
hes about to say something --

ANNA
(resolute)
Im fine

As we CUT TO --
EXT FOREST -- SAME

A flock of GEESE fly over a secluded LOG CABIN tucked inside
a dense WILDERNESS A RIVER roars beside

A MAN in a dark suit wades across the river towards a YOUNG
FISHERMAN casting for SALMON A closer look reveals the
suited man is a GRAY-HAIRED CLERIC He bears an ENVELOPE
which he hands to the Young Fisherman

A closer look reveals the Young Fisherman is JOHN SURRATT
as we CUT BACK TO --

INT COURTROOM -- SAME
Aiken stands beside Anna at the witness box

AIKEN
Miss Surratt when is the last time
you saw your brother John

ANNA
Monday the 3rd of April

Aiken turns to the Commission for emphasis

AIKEN
Eleven days prior to the
assassination Did he say where he
was headed

She shakes her head

GENERAL HUNTER
Please answer for the record

ANNA
He did not He only told me he had
to leave town

AIKEN
Miss Surratt was your brother
involved in a conspiracy to
assassinate President Lincoln and
other members of the Government

Anna looks at her mother then looks away

ANNA
I cant say

AIKEN
You cant Or you wont

ANNA
I dont know if he was involved I
only know that my mother was not

Aiken glances at Wiechmann seated in the gallery

Anna nods

AIKEN
According to Lt Wiechmann your
mother welcomed these prisoners
into her boardinghouse with open
arms

ANNA
Its not true Hes lying
(turns to Wiechmann)
How could you She would sit up and
wait for you at night the same as
for my own brother

HOLT
Objection

GENERAL HUNTER
Miss Surratt You will address this
Commission not the gallery Is
that understood

AIKEN
Did your mother object to these men
being at the boardinghouse

ANNA
She said she did not understand why
strange persons should call there

AIKEN
Then why didnt she refuse them
ANNA
She supposed their object was to see
my brother
AIKEN
John Surratt
ANNA
Yes
AIKEN

So she was merely treating them
politely as any lady would

ANNA
Yes

AIKEN
What about John Wilkes Booth Did
she object to him as well

ANNA
Mr Booth was not a stranger

AIKEN
In fact he was friends with your
brother John Was he not

Mary calls out to Aiken

MARY
That is enough

Anna glances at her mother

AIKEN
Please answer the question Miss
Surratt

Anna proceeds tentatively

ANNA
I never asked my brother what his
friendship was to Booth

AIKEN
But the fact remains Mr Booth
frequently called on your brother

ANNA
Yes

Aiken presents a piece of evidence already presented in court --
the picture called Morning Noon and Night

AIKEN
Does this belong to you

ANNA
It was given to me by that man
Wiechmann

AIKEN

But it was you who put the photo of
John Wilkes Booth behind it

ANNA
Yes I went to a daguerrean gallery
one day to get a picture taken I
saw some photographs of Mr Booth
there and being acquainted with
him I bought one and took it home

AIKEN
Your brother mustve been pleased
you thought so highly of his friend

ANNA

When my brother saw it he told me
to tear it up and throw it in the

fire

And that if I did not he

would take it from me

Why

AIKEN
Why would your brother tell

you to do that

ANNA

Youll have to ask him

AIKEN

Thank you Miss Surratt That will
be all Your witness

He turns to Holt

HOLT

We have nothing your honor The
People view Miss Surratts situation
with compassion And can understand
how shed be moved to conceal her
mothers guilt even offering up her
own brother as a sacrificial lamb

ANNA

But Im telling the truth My mother
is innocent

HOLT
The truth is based in fact -- not
emotion

AIKEN

The truth sir is the truth Not
what you choose to make of it

GENERAL HUNTER

If there are no further questions
the witness may stand down

ANNA

Youve got to believe me

GENERAL HUNTER

Please call your next witness Mr
Aiken

Anna remains in

the witness box

GENERAL HUNTER (CONTD)

Miss Surratt you are dismissed

Anna tentatively begins to leave the witness box She looks

to her mother

Mary looks back with disappointment

AIKEN

Your honor everyone else I wish to
call has either been silenced by
jail or the threat of one

HAMILTON
(asides to Baker)
Disloyalty surrounds itself with
disloyal friends

Anna overhears Hamilton on her way to the door

GENERAL HUNTER
I take it then the defense rests

Aiken glances at Mary She wont even look at him Aiken
turns back towards General Hunter -- and nods Anna holds a
moment at the door devastated As she exits we CUT TO --

---A SALMON flipping for its life inside a WICKER CREEL
PULL BACK EXT FOREST -- DAY

As JOHN SURRATT sits mournfully beside his fishing basket
the opened ENVELOPE in hand flapping in the wind

AIKEN (0S)
After the most thorough investigation
in our nations history

PULL BACK INT COURTROOM -- SAME
As Aiken begins his closing argument

AIKEN
the governments entire case
against Mary Surratt rests on three
acts alone

The courtroom is rapt -- Baker Catherine even Hamilton

AIKEN (CONTD)
1) That she befriended John Wilkes
Booth and his fellow Conspirators
2) That she carried a package from
Booth with instructions the day of
the assassination and
3) That she failed to recognize
the prisoner Lewis Payne at the
time of her arrest

Aiken rises from his chair

AIKEN (CONTD)
By themselves these three acts
constitute no crime You or I
mightve done the same But the
prosecution insists she did so with
evil intent -- largely on the
testimony of two witnesses Louis
Wiechmann and John Lloyd

Aiken glances at WIECHMANN and LLOYD in the Gallery
AIKEN (CONTD)

Yet all the facts suggest they should
be on trial At best their own
actions undermine their credibility
At worst theyve done the unspeakable
gained their freedom by falsely
accusing another of their crime

(crossing the courtroom)
But let there be no doubt why Mary
Surratt is here today It is because
of one person her son John

(his back to Mary)
John Surratt invited Booth and his
associates into her home She did
not And he hid the rifles and
ammunition inside Lloyds tavern
Not her

Aiken spots Reverdy who nods his approval

AIKEN (CONTD)
If John Surratt was part of this
conspiracy I hope he receives every
punishment known to man But if
Mary Surratt can be convicted on
such insufficient evidence then
none of us is safe

Aiken pauses in front of Baker and Hamilton

AIKEN (CONTD)

To preserve the Union Id have given
my life Now I find myself without
a side Neither with the North or
against the South My friends have
become foes -- my enemies allies

(looks at Hamilton)
But to abide by our Constitution is
not a question of latitude and
longitude -- North or South Its
about what kind of nation are we
One ruled by laws Or by the fury
of our People

Aiken examines a picture of Lincoln

AIKEN (CONTD)
What enemy should we fear most
Lincoln was asked Will it come
from Europe Africa or Asia No he
replied If were to be destroyed
itll be from within By failing to
protect our Constitution and its
laws

He puts the image of Lincoln back down

AIKEN (CONTD)
So if we are willing to die on the
battlefield defending our nation
against a hostile force then we
(MORE )

AIKEN (CONTD)
too must safeguard our founding
principles with our lives

(a beat)
Above all we must never sacrifice
our sacred rights -- out of a desire
for revenge -- when so many have

given their lives to preserve them
Aiken returns to his seat and glances at Mary A small nod
expresses her gratitude Out of the corner of his eye Aiken
spots Catherine who is visibly moved

HOLT (0S)

Gentlemen One bullet may have killed

our beloved President
Holt begins his rebuttal

HOLT
One bullet but not one man

We close on a WIDE SHOT of the CROWDED courtroom
SLOW DISSOLVE TO

The same WIDE SHOT of the courtroom only now its EMPTY --
indicating the TRIAL is OVER

EXTINT FOREST -- LOG CABIN - NEXT DAY
The sound of nature fills the secluded log cabin

John Surratt leans over a DESK with a bottle of BOURBON beside
as he agonizes over what to do

INT MARYS CELL -- SAME
Aiken enters
AIKEN
Theyre still deliberating Its a
good sign
Mary says nothing
AIKEN (CONTD)
Im sorry I went after your son like
that I felt I had no choice
After several moments
MARY
How bout we forget about the trial
for a while
Aiken nods pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket
MARY (CONTD)

Surely there must be others youd
prefer to play with
AIKEN
Im afraid Ive lost my seat at the
card table

MARY

I reckon thats true
She takes the cards from Aikens hands

MARY (CONTD)
Both my father and husband went to
their eternal rest without a dime
cause of these fifty-two

AIKEN
Perhaps youd fancy this instead

He withdraws a flask from his undercoat which he smuggled
inside She takes the flask

MARY
I fancy both -- straight up and seven
card stud
And she starts shuffling -- like a pro

MARY (CONTD)
Hopefully my lucks about to change
What are we wagering

AIKEN
Always the clothes on our backs

A beat Then Mary smiles Aiken finds a spot across from
her on the floor As she starts to deal we hear --

-NINE HANDS raised high in the air
PULL BACK INT ELEGANT DINING ROOM -- NOON

Damn it Joseph I told you she
must be punished to the full extent

PULL BACK INT WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTONS OFFICE -- LATER
SECRETARY STANTON is irate HOLT attempts to appease him

HOLT
Only four of the nine agreed with
your recommendation The majority
favored a more merciful sentence -
life in prison - on account of her
age and sex

STANTON
How else will her son surrender if
hes not forced to offer his life
for hers

HOLT
I understand sir Unfortunately
the Generals minds are already made

STANTON
Perhaps not

A long beat Stantons EYES remain hard and cold
MARY (0S)

This Yank up North comes home after
chopping some wood

PULL BACK INT MARYS CELL -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken and Mary have now shared a few -- jokes and drinks
MARY

--Says to his wife Honey my hands
are freezing

(Aiken takes a drink)
Put ‘em between my thighs she
replies Thatll warm ‘em up

Aiken freezes mid-gulp

MARY (CONTD)

After lunch he goes out and chops
some more wood Says Sweetheart
my hands are really freezing
Well put ‘em between my thighs

(Mary downs her drink)
Before bed the Yank goes out one
more time to get ‘em through the
night Dear my hands are frozen
he says as he walks back inside
For goodness sake his wife replies
dont your ears ever get cold

Aiken spits his drink Both he and Mary enjoy the moment

Marys smile slowly disappears

MARY (CONTD)
He hates me

AIKEN
Pardon

MARY
My son It wasnt Lincoln he
despised It was me

AIKEN
I dont follow

MARY
I refused to have him turn out like
his father I wouldnt let him out
of my sight Kept him so close I
made him sit out the entire War
Finally he got the courage to break
free and become what he always wanted -
what you are Frederick

AIKEN
Whats that

MARY
Your own man

A long beat

MARY (CONTD)
Go to her

Off Aikens confusion Mary says solemnly --
MARY (CONTD)
Im not looking forward to it But
Im ready for what they have in store
for me Anna is not

AIKEN
Im not leaving you

The Soldier stops looks up at Mary before continuing as we
quickly CUT from one image to another --

-- Reverdy reading from the Constitution
-- John Surratt downing his drink
-- Aiken and Anna remain in silence her back to him
And then we CUT BACK TO --
INT CELL
Mary calmly nods for the Soldier to continue reading
YOUNG SOLDIER (VO)
--To be hanged by the neck until
she be dead

Mary maintains her face until the Young Soldier exits
then buckles just a bit from what shes just been told

As we CUT BACK TO --

INT BOARDINGHOUSE

Anna and Aiken remain in silence for several beats Finally
Aiken says softly

AIKEN
You were in love with Booth Thats
why you didnt burn his photo
After a moment
ANNA
I swear I had no idea what he was
capable of
We HOLD ON Anna as we CUT TO --
INT BOARDINGHOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

John Surratt storms inside as Anna in an apron with her
hair up is preparing supper

JOHN SURRATT
Booth is crazy Hes gonna get us

into trouble -- or worse

ANNA
Calm down John Just tell me what
happened

JOHN SURRATT
He told me to pack a bag He didnt
say where Im going He just insists
I leave town tonight

ANNA
Ok Then go pack your bag

JOHN SURRATT
Ma wont let me go -- even if I
wanted

ANNA
What hes fighting for what were
fighting for is more important than
any of us

JOHN SURRATT
Richmonds fallen The War is over

ANNA
The War is far from over John
Theres still much we can do
(John doesnt budge)
Dont be like Pa Have the courage
to see something through

John angrily turns away and storms up the stairs

MANS VOICE (0S)
Impressive

Anna is startled Booth is standing in the kitchen doorway

ANNA

Mr Booth
BOOTH

Anna Looking as lovely as ever
ANNA

Lovely Indeed you are a fine

actor

Anna removes her apron in an attempt to make herself
presentable

ANNA (CONTD)
How long have you been there

BOOTH
Long enough to know the Cause would
be better off with more like you

ANNA
Thank you Mr Booth Thats a
compliment I will accept

There is an undeniable chemistry here

Off-screen Mary and her son are in a heated conversation
(NOTE The rest of this scene is familiar from earlier in
the script -- only we saw it from Marys POV not Annas)

MARY (0S)
Theres nothing more you can do

JOHN SURRATT (0S)
The war is far from over Mother
And theres still much I can do

BOOTH
Does he not have an original thought

ANNA
Think what you will Mr Booth but
hes still my brother

BOOTH
My apologies Miss Surratt Ill
see to it he makes you proud

MARY (0S)
John please

JOHN SURRATT (0S)
Unhand me Mother

Suddenly there is a CRASH upstairs Silence follows Anna
moves towards the stairs but Booth grabs her arm

BOOTH
(shouts upstairs)
John are you coming or not

Moments later John Surratt comes down the stairs a packed
bag in hand He blows past Anna and says to Booth

JOHN SURRATT
Lets go

Booth and Anna exchange a look Booth follows John Surratt
out the front door

Several moments later Mary comes down the stairs She is
bleeding from a cut above her eye

Off Mary exchanging a long look with Anna we CUT BACK TO --
PRESENT TIME INT BOARDINGHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Anna tears now streaking her face is holding a WANTED POSTER
featuring John Surratt

ANNA
It should be my face on this -- not
his

Aiken remains silent

ANNA (CONTD)
I am such a coward Hes my younger
brother I shouldve protected him
But instead I pushed him into it

AIKEN
You didnt know exactly what you
were pushing him into

ANNA
I know now And yet I still told
you where to find him and damned
him on the stand

AIKEN
You did so to save your mother

ANNA
They need to know what I did

AIKEN
To what end Because it will help
your mother none

ANNA
But its the truth

AIKEN
Does she know

Anna nods

AIKEN (CONTD)
Then no one else needs to

And Aiken turns for the door and exits leaving Anna alone
EXT BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken begins to descend the steps He hesitates a moment
thinks on it and then continues on his way

INT CELL

Mary at her cell window soaks in the late afternoon
sunlight as we hear off screen --

PAPER BOY (0S)
DEATH BY HANGING DEATH BY HANGING

PULL BACK EXT WASHINGTON STREET

As a DOZEN CUSTOMERS surround a PAPER BOY who is chanting
the headlines aloud almost gleefully

PAPER BOY
Mary Surratt To Meet Her Doom
Four Assassins Die Tomorrow at Noon

Aiken happens upon the excitement still unaware As the
crowd slowly parts the headline is revealed to him

FOUR CONSPIRATORS TO BE EXECUTED
Herold Atzerodt Payne
and
MARY SURRATT

Others Get Prison Terms

Aiken looks up from the paper and spots Catherine -- along
with his mates -- across the street

Aiken takes off Only Catherine sees him scurrying away
While the others chatter about the impending executions
Catherine remains apart with a look of dismay as we cut to --

FULL SCREEN Of a ROCK wrapped with the latest newspaper
surrounded by shattered GLASS

PULL BACK INT BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER

Revealing Anna slumped sobbing with the rock beside her
Its clear shes now heard the news

INT US CAPITOL - AIKENS OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
Aiken in disbelief Reverdy Johnson is behind his desk

AIKEN
Mudd Arnold and OLaughlin got life
in prison instead of death And
Spangler only a half a dozen years

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton doesnt want their sons
Any word from hers

Aiken shakes his head

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Then theres nothing more you can
do

AIKEN
There has to be something

REVERDY JOHNSON
Fred youve done everything you
possibly could Better than I would
have done But your only allegiance
now must be to yourself

AIKEN
There are at least a dozen grounds
on which to appeal this verdict

REVERDY JOHNSON
And you know theres no appealing
it Thats why Stanton tried her in
a military court

AIKEN
What about petitioning the President
for a stay

REVERDY JOHNSON
The President signed the execution
order Its over

AIKEN
Can you get me in to see him Ill
plead her case directly

Reverdy cuts him off

REVERDY JOHNSON
If John Surratt wont sacrifice
himself son why should you Shes
not your mother

AIKEN
And youre not my father

CHOIR BOY (0S)
Colonel Aiken

A CHOIR BOY 12 is standing in the doorway Aiken nods

CHOIR BOY

The Boy passes him a NOTE Aiken quickly reads it then
grabs his jacket and heads for the door

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton will destroy you if you
persist Freddie this is not a war

But Aiken is gone as we CUT TO --
--The SOUND of screeching across a stone floor

PULL BACK INT ARSENAL PRISON - SECOND FLOOR -- DUSK

A GUARD pushes a CART down the second-story CATWALK stopping
in front of DAVID HEROLDs CELL He passes a TRAY inside

HEROLD receives the BEER and SANDWICH his FINAL MEAL

Aiken enters with Marys TRAY He raises the cover

MARY

AIKEN
And some laudanum to calm the nerves

Aiken hands her a small bottle filled with liquid
MARY

My goodness you remembered the
spanish olives

AIKEN

Aiken nods toward the door as Anna suddenly appears Anna
freezes in the doorway Doesnt know what to do

Mary opens her arms Anna rushes into them For the first
time in a long while Anna is allowed to be a young girl again

Mary cradles Anna in her arms She takes in every inch

MARY
I think this is what Im going to

AIKEN
You dont know that For Gods sake

MARY

MARY (CONTD)
Hopefully then vengeance will no

Anna can remain silent no longer

ANNA
This is my fault

MARY
Hold your tongue

She glances at Aiken

ANNA
He knows Ma He knows I pushed
John into this

MARY
You poor dear You must put your
mind at ease

ANNA
I will never forgive myself

MARY
You are not to blame Anna

AIKEN
Nor you Mary It is your son who
should be held accountable Forget

MARY
I assure you Frederick we will all
be summoned before the judgment bar
of God -- where every knee must bend
and every tongue confess

ANNA
Please Ma Let me tell them

MARY
Shhh my sweet Ive lived a blessed

MARY

Aiken turns for the door

MARY (CONTD)

A beat

AIKEN

And Aiken departs

The sound of HAMMERING fills Marys cell As Mary pulls
Anna closer to her we CUT TO --

construct the GALLOWS The SETTING SUN envelops the PRISON
in a fiery orange

Catherine is meeting with several SOCIETY WOMEN We dont
know exactly what is being said except that shes arguing
with passion -- and seems to be convincing a few

INT WAR DEPT - HOLTS OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
As Aiken pleads with Holt far less successfully

HOLT
The death sentence is signed Colonel
Theres nothing I can do

AIKEN
Im not asking to overturn the verdict --
merely for a stay So I can petition
for a new trial in a civil court
before a jury of her peers

HOLT
Then youll have to speak directly
with the President Hes the only
one who can grant such a delay

Aiken begins to leave Holt calls out

HOLT (CONTD)
I dare say you have a better chance
overturning this building than getting
him to save your client Lest he
arouse suspicion his own hands have
Lincolns blood on them

Aiken seems about to disclose John Surratts whereabouts

HOLT (CONTD)
Something you wish to tell me
Colonel

Aiken considers then shakes No
HOLT (CONTD)

In that case dear boy theres

nothing more you can do
EXT GARDEN -- EARLY EVENING
Catherine is now surrounded by a larger crowd of SOCIETY
WOMEN -- all near her age Seems shes won more converts to
her side though her exact cause is not yet clear to us

EXTINT WHITE HOUSE -- SAME

The lights are on UPSTAIRS in the Presidents private
residence but hes nowhere to be found DOWNSTAIRS

Aiken appeals to two graybeards -- CONGRESSMAN KING and
SENATOR LANE -- just inside the front FOYER
AIKEN

All I require is a few moments of
the Presidents time

CONGRESSMAN KING
Ive already told you Colonel the
President wont interfere with the
Courts ruling This is a military
matter and must be taken up with
the War Department

AIKEN
And I just told you theyre insisting
the decision is up to the President

SENATOR LANE
Were sorry

AIKEN
Congressman King Senator Lane At
least permit me to ask President
Johnson for a weeks delay

SENATOR LANE

The judges have ruled and theres

nothing the President can do
Off Aiken appearing to have run out of options we CUT TO --
-The SOUND of shattered GLASS
PULL BACK INT MARY SURRATTS CELL - SAME
As Mary smashes the empty laudanum bottle into pieces She
checks Anna who is in a laudanum-induced deep sleep before

selecting the largest SLIVER Mary begins to raise the knife-
like shard up towards her THROAT

SliceSliceSLICE STRANDS of HAIR falling gently into

of HAMMERING fills the room like a rhythmic DIRGE

As the MOON rises high in the sky

Aiken enters crestfallen seemingly nothing more he can do
To his surprise Reverdy Johnson is seated behind his desk --
surrounded by LEGAL TOMES
REVERDY JOHNSON
Pull up a chair Freddie Weve got

Aiken does as told The men start working away their heads
buried in case law After several beats --

INT US CAPITOL - REVERDY JOHNSONS OFFICE -- SAME

SUNLIGHT catches Aiken in the EYE He looks at Reverdy who
is writing away then glances at the WALL CLOCK which reads

605 AM

Suddenly CATHERINE appears in the doorway accompanied by a
DOZEN WOMEN in their Sunday best

AIKEN
Catherine What are you doing here

CATHERINE
We wish to help your client

AIKEN
How

CATHERINE
By petitioning the President on her
behalf

AIKEN

Youre serious
Catherine nods So do the other women
AIKEN (CONTD)
Its a very kind gesture Thank
you But Ive tried Its impossible
to even get through the door
CATHERINE
Perhaps the daughters of a senator
congressman two ambassadors and a
cabinet member may persuade him to
let us in
Aiken looks at Reverdy for his response
REVERDY JOHNSON
Impossible may have been a bit
strong Fred Ladies good luck

Reverdy Catherine exchange smiles Aiken is clearly touched
Reverdy hands Aiken a DOCUMENT hes been working on

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONTD)
Frederick Run

Catherine gives Aiken a kiss as he rushes out the door
INT US CAPITOL - MOMENTS LATER

Aiken sprints across STATUARY HALL past the BUSTS of our
Founding Fathers then out the Capitol doors

---Pounding and POUNDING
PULL BACK EXT TOWNHOUSE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

Aiken beats on the FRONT DOOR of a three-story BROWNSTONE
along a quiet residential street

No street TRAFFIC outside No LIGHTS on inside No ANSWER

Aiken pounds again and again Moments later a fragile OLD
MAN opens the door still tying on his robe

OLD MAN
What in Gods name

AIKEN
Justice Wylie

OLD MANJUSTICE WYLIE
Who are you

AIKEN
Frederick Aiken your honor I have
an application here for a writ of
habeas corpus

AIKEN

Court of the District of Columbia is

JUSTICE WYLIE

AIKEN
Mary Surratt

Wylie becomes agitated

JUSTICE WYLIE
I cant help you son Im sorry
Now please go

Aiken holds up the WRIT APPLICATION

AIKEN
Please sir Either you act now -
or else an innocent woman will die

Wylie begins to close his door then pauses to reconsider
He checks the street both ways before waving Aiken inside

EXT WHITE HOUSE -- SAME

Catherine leads her small army inside the White House past
the gatekeepers -- SENATOR LANE and CONGRESSMAN KING

INT JUDGES STUDY -- SHORT WHILE LATER

MRS WYLIE enters with tea and biscuits Aiken anxiously
waits as Justice Wylie reviews his WRIT

JUSTICE WYLIE
During the War Lincoln suspended a
number of our rights -- including
the writ of habeas corpus which you
seek here today If he hadnt we
mightve lost the Union So how
can you argue with his decision
What good is our Constitution if
our nation is destroyed

Aiken looks distraught
JUSTICE WYLIE (CONTD)
But then again what good is our
nation without our Constitution

Off Aikens expression changing to relief --
INT WAR DEPARTMENT - HOLTS OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER

As Aiken slams the WRIT down on Holts desk Holt caught
off-guard shaving foam still on his face examines the WRIT

HOLT

You had no right Colonel
AIKEN

Wrong dear boy Its our

Constitutional right She should be
released no later than noon

Aiken exits Holt turns to an aide

HOLT
Sergeant Find Secretary Stanton --
immediately
EXT WHITE HOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER

As Catherine and her group emerge from the White House
Stanton rushes inside Catherine looks on with concern

INT ARSENAL PRISON - MARYS CELL -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Anna has a look of shock
ANNA
So therell be a civil trial next

time No generals

AIKEN
No generals

Anna can barely believe Aikens news Mary too

MARY
Bless you son

Mary regards Aiken as if he were her own Hes clearly moved
Anna and Mary embrace Aiken glances out the window

AIKENS POV From the window down into the COURTYARD below --
FOUR CHAIRS are being set up atop the HANGING PLATFORM

Aikens face fills with panic

As he turns back from the window SOLDIERS suddenly appear
at Marys door Leading the way is the prisons COMMANDANT

COMMANDANT
Maam its time

AIKEN
What are you doing

COMMANDANT
We need to prepare her with the
others
AIKEN
The only preparing should be for her
release

The Commandant glances toward Anna

COMMANDANT
I advise sedating the young lady

ANNA
Youll do no such thing

Aiken presents the Judicial Order

AIKEN
Ive got a writ that says Mary Surratt
is to be released into my custody

COMMANDANT
Colonel The President just suspended
your writ

He hands Aiken the Executive Order from the War Department

COMMANDANT (CONTD)
Im sorry Shes to hang alongside
the others no later than noon Now
step aside Weve got less than an
hour

On the Commandants signal the Soldiers move Aiken aside

ANNA
Frederick Do something

Anna clutches her mother Mary slips a HAIR BRACELET shes
woven from her own locks onto her daughters wrist

MARY
Ill always be with you

ANNA
Please Tell them they cant

Aiken scans the Executive Order His expression indicates
theres nothing he can do As the Soldiers begin to escort
Mary she clasps her BIBLE and ROSARY beads

MARY
No mother was ever more proud Anna
Frederick Thank you

Aiken steadies Anna But its as if hes steadying himself
Suddenly Anna pulls away from Aiken

ANNA
Let go of her

And she pounces on the soldiers They quickly restrain Anna
as the Prison Doctor injects her with a sedative
MARY ANNA
Please God Dont No Mama No
let them hurt her

Anna screams as her mother is being led away Mary stricken
with concern calls out

MARY
I love you darling

Anna crumbles as Aiken catches her

AIKEN
Ive got her Mary Its ok

Mary seeing that Aiken has Anna relaxes slightly then
calls out to Aiken

MARY
Proverbs 2916 Frederick Promise
you wont forget

AIKEN
I promise

And Mary disappears from view As Anna begins to fade from
exhaustion and the sedative she mumbles aloud

ANNA
Ill never forgive myself

AIKEN
Its ok Anna Its ok

Anna gently lays Anna down The Commandant retrieves Marys
white HANDKERCHIEF from the cell floor and hands it to Aiken

COMMANDANT
Proverbs 2916

Aiken repeats by rote staring off in shock

AIKEN
When the wicked are in authority
transgressions increase
(a beat)
But the righteous will look upon
their downfall

INT WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTONS OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken rushes past Stantons AIDE
STANTONS AIDE
Sir you cant enter without an
appointment

Aiken ignores the Aide and bursts inside STANTONS OFFICE

He finds the War Secretary seemingly OBLIVIOUS to events
beyond -- reading a paper while devouring a hearty breakfast
STANTON
Youre too late counselor You had
your chance
Stantons Aide rushes inside

AIDE
Im so sorry Mr Secretary

Stanton waves the Aide off

AIKEN
For Gods sake shes innocent
STANTON
I didnt sentence her the Court
did
AIKEN

At your request no doubt

STANTON
Assuming I could why would I ever
choose to do such a thing

AIKEN
Revenge

STANTON
Goodness no Id never go to such
lengths out of vengeance
(a beat)
But to assure the safety and security
of this nation indeed Id do
anything

AIKEN
But you want her son

STANTON
At this point Ill settle for either
one

AIKEN
Like a human sacrifice

STANTON
Just think of her as another casualty
of war

He points to a stack of CASUALTY PHOTOS from the war

AIKEN
On which side

STANTON
Union over Disunion

AIKEN
Not the Union I fought for Nor the
one Lincoln gave his life to save
(MORE )
AIKEN (CONTD)
No Union is worth preserving unless
it guarantees justice for all

STANTON
Words for rallying the troops Colonel --
Not for running a nation

AIKEN
If you permit this injustice I
promise youll regret the day

STANTON
Is that a threat young man

AIKEN
Its a prediction

--A slip of PAPER with MARY SURRATT written across it
PULL BACK INT ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- NEAR NOON

Marys NAME is put inside a BOTTLE The bottle is then placed
inside a GUN CRATE baring a WINCHESTER label

The CRATE is set next to THREE identical BOXES -- each with
a bottled name inside -- ATZERODT HEROLD and PAYNE

The FOUR COFFINS now wait to be filled alongside the GALLOWS
Nearby a SOLDIER passes the PRISON COMMANDANT a NOTE

SOLDIER
Captain the prisoner Lewis Payne
just made this confession

COMMANDANT
Whats it about

SOLDIER
The woman sir He swears shes
innocent
(a beat)
What if its the truth

Both remain in SILENCE as the HANGMAN tests the ROPE
MATCH CUT TO
Aiken tugging on a HORSES REINS

BEGIN MONTAGE
(No dialogue just music)

Aiken races across town in a horse-drawn BUGGY desperate to
reach Mary before its too late

A GUARD unlocks a METAL DOOR as the PRISONERS -- Atzerodt
Herold Payne and Mary Surratt -- are led from their CELLS
Mary clenches ROSARY BEADS firmly in her RIGHT HAND

The Prison Doctor tends to Anna inside Marys cell He places
her hand across her chest -- Marys HAIR BRACELET now rests
on Annas heart

Aiken abandons his buggy in TRAFFIC and begins weaving his
way through the crowd He throws off his UNION JACKET as a
passing carriage rides over it grinding it into the ground

Inside the PRISON COURTYARD HUNDREDS of SPECTATORS and PRESS
excitedly await the spectacle about to happen

A Soldier opens a BLACK PARASOL over Marys head to
chivalrously shield her from the broiling midday SUN The
FOUR PRISONERS are now led across the COURTYARD forced to
pass a GAUNTLET of onlookers on their way to the GALLOWS

Aiken navigates a gauntlet of his own OUTSIDE the PRISON
WALLS as VENDORS gleefully hawk LEMONADE and CAKES

Mary ascends the GALLOWS where the HANGMAN now awaits Aiken
pushes past the MOBS racing inside the PRISON WALLS Father
Walter now by Marys side administers FINAL RITES

The other THREE PRISONERS are readied with WHITE HOODS
covering their heads to conceal their panicked faces The
HANGMAN removes Marys BONNET and VEIL fastening her hands
behind her back and her skirt about her knees

Aiken rushes inside the COURTYARD past BAKER and CATHERINE
desperate to see Mary before its too late

He spots Mary She sees him too A SMALL SMILE springs to
her lips Aiken SMILES BACK wiping tears from his eyes

He nods one LAST TIME to her And she to him

The HANGMAN places the HOOD and NOOSE over Marys head as
Aiken looks away -- unable to watch any more

Aiken feels a HAND on his shoulder It belongs to REVERDY
JOHNSON who buttresses Aiken for whats about to happen

The PRISON COMMANDANT claps THREE TIMES --

Followed by FOUR SOLDIERS who knock away the support beams
beneath the platform holding up the PRISONERS --

The HANGING PLATFORM swings down on its hinges as Mary and
the others jerk downward with a terrifying

THUMP

Then silence -- a long deafening SILENCE -- broken finally
by the sound of a FLASH BULB

We HOLD ON an image of the scaffold as Mary Surratt becomes
yet another CASUALTY PHOTO of the war

As JUDGE GEORGE FISHER 54 attempts to quiet the PACKED
COURTROOM with his gavel

JUDGE FISHER
Gentlemen of the jury have you agreed
upon a verdict

WASHINGTON DC CRIMINAL COURT

AUGUST 10 1867 - TWO YEARS LATER
The FOREMAN 43 rises

FOREMAN (0S)
No your honor We have not

The FOREMAN and JURY are distinct for being indistinct -- 12
CIVILIANS mixed equally of Northerners and Southerners

FOREMAN
We are deadlocked on the eighth ballot
as we were on the first

JUDGE FISHER
Do you think youll ever reach a
unanimous verdict in this matter
The Foreman looks troubled and weary

FOREMAN
No your honor Im afraid not

JUDGE FISHER
In that case I declare a mistrial
The defendant is hereby free to leave

But the DEFENDANT now revealed hardly looks free -- JOHN
SURRATT looks more like a prisoner of guilt

His sister ANNA is beside him She shows no sign of joy
or even relief Instead she glances to the back of the
courtroom to FREDERICK AIKEN just a bystander now

Aiken nods to Anna John Surratt attempts to see where Anna
is looking But when he does Aiken is long gone

--The sound of WEEPING
PULL BACK INT COURTHOUSE -- BATHROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER

As we reveal John Surratt is sobbing inconsolably his face
buried into the wall He senses someone watching and turns

The POV on John Surratt belongs to Aiken who just stares at
him without a word John Surratt gathers his emotions
JOHN SURRATT
Youre Frederick Aiken arent you

Aiken nods

JOHN SURRATT (CONTD)
II neverI wish to thank you
for the kindness you showed my mother

Aiken says nothing

JOHN SURRATT (CONTD)
Believe me Mr Aiken I never thought
theyd kill her She committed no
crime

AIKEN
Well now you have your freedom

JOHN SURRATT
I killed my mother I will never be
free

Neither says a word Tears streak Surratts face Aiken
removes a white HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket

AIKEN
It belonged to her I hope it
comforts you in your grief

Aiken begins to leave
JOHN SURRATT
Keep it Colonel She now belongs
to you

Aiken pauses a moment and decides to keep the handkerchief
He exits without a word as we HOLD ON John Surratts grief

EXT CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- HALLWAY - DAY
Aiken exits the majestic building He is met by Catherine
and Baker He spots Anna across the way in conversation
Aiken excuses himself and walks over to Anna
Anna greets him with a warm smile
ANNA

Its good of you to come Frederick

Id like you to meet my husband

William Tonry this is

WILLIAM TONRY
Its an honor Mr Aiken

WILLIAM TONRY mid-20s shakes Aikens hand

Anna lovingly grabs her belly which we now realize is
pregnant Her mothers hair bracelet is apparent
ANNA
If shes a girl were naming her
Mary

AIKEN

Your mother would like that
An awkward beat

AIKEN (CONTD)
I should be getting back

Anna nods sweetly

AIKEN (CONTD)
Congratulations to you both

WILLIAM TONRY
It was nice meeting you

Aiken smiles and rejoins Catherine and Baker

As they descend the Courthouse steps several YOUNG TURKS
watch Aiken with a look of awe -- reminiscent of Aiken with
his buddies spotting luminaries at the start of the story

One of the young turks begins to approach Aiken but his
buddy grabs him

YOUNG TURK 1
You cant just go up to him without
an introduction

We pull back as Aiken crosses beneath a grand STATUE of LADY
JUSTICE -- a SCALE in one hand and SWORD in the other

We continue pulling back until Aiken and the others are
SWALLOWED by the People below

BEGIN END CREDITS
(titlecards accompanied by relevant images)

The year after the Conspirators trial the SUPREME COURT
ruled military trials of US citizens were unconstitutional

Few were surprised a jury -- half from the North and half
from the South -- could not agree on a verdict in the matter
of JOHN SURRATT He was never tried again

EDWIN STANTON was fired by President Johnson after discovering
he had forced the Commission to change Mary Surratts sentence
from life to death Stanton never held office again

(IMAGE Stanton barricading himself inside his office)

JOSEPH HOLT denied his role in the plot with Stanton and

spent the rest of his life trying to clear his own name
(IMAGE Holt being hounded by the press)

None of the GENERALS ever served on another Military
Commission But GENERAL LEWIS WALLACE did achieve renown of
a different sort as the author of BEN HUR

(IMAGE Wallace sketching chariot races at the deliberations )

CONGRESSMAN PRESTON KING and SENATOR JAMES LANE both
reportedly guilt-ridden at having helped prevent a stay of
execution committed suicide soon after Mary Surratts death
(IMAGE The pair blocking Aiken from seeing the President)

JOHN SURRATT married a relative of Francis Scott Key the
author of The Star Spangled Banner He was the father of
seven and worked as an auditor until his death in 1916
(IMAGE John still weighted with guilt)

ANNA SURRATT and her husband had four children Fired by

the War Department for marrying Anna WILLIAM TONRY went on

to earn the first honorary degree in chemistry from Georgetown
University The couple named their eldest Mary

(IMAGE Anna showing her hair bracelet to her daughter Mary)

SENATOR REVERDY JOHNSON continued battling to safeguard the
Constitution He was instrumental in saving President Johnson
from impeachment by a partisan group led by Edwin Stanton
(IMAGE Johnson happily eating his dinner alone)

FREDERICK AIKEN left the law and became a journalist But
kept his promise to Mary Surratt continuing to fight
injustice as the first city editor of THE WASHINGTON POST
(IMAGE Aiken Catherine by his side putting out the paper)

In 1869 PRESIDENT JOHNSON granted full unconditional pardons
to the only conspirators still living -- SAMUEL MUDD EDWARD
SPANGLER and SAMUEL ARNOLD He ordered the bodies of the
others be exhumed and returned to their families
MARY SURRATT was given a proper burial by her daughter ANNA
