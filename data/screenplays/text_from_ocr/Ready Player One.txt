EXT CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT - THE OASIS

We open on BETHESDA FOUNTAIN in the heart of New York’s
Central Park then we pull up and away hurtling backwards
over the city until we come to rest in TIMES SQUARE which
has been blocked off for an EPIC STREET RACE

EXT TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Huge crowds line the street cheering on TWENTY EXOTIC
VEHICLES waiting at the starting line

A MOTORBIKE straight from Road Warrior idles on the outside
lane Most of the other racers are in STOCK CARS every
driver wearing the same helmet

These are SIXERS we’ll get back to them later

Interspersed with the Sixers are vehicles of every variety
And when I say every variety I mean that some of them are
cars and some of them are hover craft and one of them is a
BLIMP with a jet engine on it

Their drivers are every size shape and color too They are
called GUNTERS That too will be on the quiz

The closer we get to the West Side of 7th Avenue the more
Gunters there are The second to last car is probably the
most bad-ass of the lot a replica of DECKARD’S SPINNER from
BLADE RUNNER

AECH a handsome guy with the shoulders of a linebacker
checks the OVERSIZED ENGINE strapped to the roof

PARZIVAL (0S)
Lemme guess - Mario Kart

He turns to see PARZIVAL standing beside his vintage
DELOREAN literally the car from BACK TO THE FUTURE He’s
nineteen years old good-looking and fit

AECH
No Designed it myself actually
Bad ass right

PARZIVAL
It’s very Nintendo

Their friendly rivalry requires busting on each other
constantly
AECH
Better than your pos level 4
skin over a level 1 frame

PARZIVAL
Weird that I’m still gonna outrace
you What does that say

AECH
It says you’re delusional Z I’m
in the two spot No way you get
farther

PARZIVAL
Let’s see who makes it past 57th

A SIREN signals the drivers to get in their cars Parzival
makes a fist Aech returns the salute

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
First to the key

AECH
First to the egg

And they get in their cars

EXT SEVENTH AVENUE

A GUNSHOT starts the race and the cars roar onto Seventh
Avenue Almost immediately an Eighteen Wheeler runs a red
light and A THIRD OF THE CARS RAM RIGHT INTO IT

And they literally explode Just like that Boom half the
cars are incinerated Nobody bats an eye or stops cheering

IN THE DELOREAN

Parzival stomps on the accelerator chasing Aechs dust Cars
bump and jockey for position but Parzival is careful to
avoid all of them steering with tremendous precision

ON 44TH STREET

Metal walls suddenly pop up from the street incongruously
and with pretty much no logic to their placement More of the

Sixer vehicles CRASH or SPIN OUT

Aech has already passed them and Parzival simply veers
through the debris
PARZIVAL
Dumbasses You don’t start from the
outside lanes

He catches up with Aech and as they HANG a LEFT on 45th
street he cuts past him on the inside

Parzival’s winning For now
EXT CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Parzival hangs a RIGHT on 8th Avenue and puts the pedal to
the floor On every block a different obstacle emerges and
each time another driver is taken out SINKHOLES open at 47th
street a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersection
at 50th street and at 54th street

A T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly
swerves between its legs just as its massive jaws POP THE
BLIMP

It’s not your typical street race

EXT 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

Parzival turns right at 57th to get back over to Seventh
Avenue and now AECH suddenly BOMBS OUT OF NOWHERE and PASSES
HIM

He flips Parzival the bird as he makes a left back onto
seventh Parzival settles in behind him Up ahead a few
blocks away is CENTRAL PARK

But before that is 58th street The whole block is in an
exaggerated state of construction like an obstacle course
leading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE

It’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the
collapsing crane and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND AS
FAST as he can

He clears the falling CRANE but he’s going too fast He
SKIDS OUT and his car FLIPS OVER

A MOMENT LATER Parzival DRIFTS PAST HIM going just a bit
slower His DeLorean SKIDS but he makes the turn

PARZIVAL
Yes

HALF A MILE AHEAD —--

A CEMENT TRUCK is backing up narrowing the space Parzival
can drive through He GUNS THE ENGINE trying to get over
fast enough to get past the TRUCK before it seals him off

But he’s too late The DeLorean SLAMS into the truck which
EXPLODES WITH WET CEMENT

AECH APPROACHES the smoking cement-covered DeLorean as
Parzival climbs out through its dented gull-wing doors

PARZIVAL (CONT’D)
Really thought I was gonna make it

AECH
I’m telling you it’s rigged

PARZIVAL
Dude don’t go there

AECH
No other explanation

Their conversation is interrupted by the ROAR OF AN ENGINE
They turn to see the ROAD WARRIOR MOTORBIKE ZOOM PAST THEM
seemingly headed straight for the truck which now has the
street completely blocked off

BECH (CONTD)
This should be ugly

The MOTORBIKE suddenly veers off the street and INTO THE
CONSTRUCTION ZONE It plows over cones then hits a stretch
of BROKEN SIDEWALK one piece angled UP and RAMPS OFF IT

JUMPING THE TRUCK

Aech and Parzival exchange a glance then chase after the
motorbike

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY

THE ROAD WARRIOR BIKE speeds towards camera fifty yards away
from the park entrance The driver is stoic completely
focused absolutely determined to make it and that’s when

A METEOR (yes I’m serious a meteor) plunges from the sky
and slams into the street The RIDER has to BAIL OUT as the
BIKE slams into the smoking rock and EXPLODES
EXT CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

Parzival and Aech run up to the wreckage The RIDER emerges
from the smoke whipping off her helmet revealing

ARTEMIS
A meteor Seriously

Aech and Parzival gape at a woman in her early twenties
raven hair big hazel eyes rounded cheekbones and a
perpetual smirk

She HURLS HER HELMET at the Meteor It too explodes

AECH
You almost made the park you
realize how huge that is

ARTEMIS
Do I have the key No Not huge

PARZIVAL
(star struck)
Hey You’re Artemis

ARTEMIS
Yeah I know

She walks past them Parzival staring has lost whatever
sense of cool he seemed to possess

PARZIVAL
I love you I mean we love you

AECH
(interrupting)
What he means is we’re big fans
Weve read your stuff seen your
channel

PARZIVAL
You should come with us

ARTEMIS
(to Aech)
He always like this

AECH
No
(to Z under his breath)
Dude act like you’ve met a girl
before
PARZIVAL
I just mean to talk about
Halliday and the Egg And the
race

ARTEMIS
You guys are gunters I mean
serious not just jerking off on
the weekend

PARZIVAL
Not jerking off on weekends at all

AECH
My socially inept friend here was
the first to 49th first to 55th

ARTEMIS
Wait a minute you’re Parzival

PARZIVAL
Yeah I know

Artemis smiles touche She turns to Aech

ARTEMIS
So where is your place anyway

INT AECH’S BASEMENT - OASIS

A suburban rec room circa the early 1980s Movie and comic
book posters cover the wood-paneled walls A vintage RCA
television is hooked up to a Betamax a LaserDisc player and
several vintage videogame consoles most prominently an ATARI

ARTEMIS
Wow

Aech leads Artemis in Parzival right behind

PARZIVAL
Show her the workshop

Aech ahead of him kicks open the door to what should be a
closet

ARTEMIS’S POV -- AN ENORMOUS WORKSHOPGARAGE

Completely out of proportion to the room Aechs garage is an
enormous space filled with exotic vehicles including
replicas of the BATMOBILE PEE WEE’S BICYCLE and most
impressively
An unfinished replica of a familiar GIANT ROBOT

ARTEMIS
Is that

AECH
The Iron Giant Yeah just got the
commission for it No big deal

Artemis checks out the surface of the enormous stylized
robot The unfinished parts of it are still a 3D grid

PARZIVAL
Aech’s work is top rated on the
modboards

AECH

(shrugging)
It’s mostly about getting the right
skins what you can license you
know Like Matrix Matrix kids
forget it but Star Wars Marvel
Dark Knight the classic Ridley
Scotts

ARTEMIS
Golden Age Spielberg

AECH
Pre-Jurassic is a bitch

ARTEMIS
Always wanted the Mothership from
Close Encounters

AECH
Yeah tough to find

PARZIVAL
Tough to park

Artemis laughs Parzival lights up

ARTEMIS
Never thought of that

AECH
Oh yeah handling is an issue I
mean you can’t build a Giant Robot
and have it ride like a Buick
Regal

ARTEMIS
Buick
PARZIVAL
A shitty car from Halliday’s time

ARTEMIS
Right

Aech pulls the door shut Music comes up TEMPTATION by
NEW ORDER the original Factus 8 version not the remix

INT AECH’S BASEMENT

Artemis bops around the room checking the place out She
comes to THE HALLIDAY WALL which is loaded with memorabilia
(And no we don’t know who he is yet but we’re getting
there )

ARTEMIS
Whoa great collection here

Most prominently the classic magazine cover from JANUARY 7
2040 the day Halliday died It’s the photo of him in faded

jeans and a vintage Space Invaders T-shirt the headline RIP
JAMES HALLIDAY 1972-2040

AECH
So youre checking my private
Gunter stash - wheres the quid pro
quo
(off her look)
The jump

Artemis debates whether or not to tell them
ARTEMIS

The sidewalk is cracked Had to be
a reason there always is with

Halliday

AECH
Exactly That’s what I’ve been
saying

PARZIVAL

Please not the “theory” again

ARTEMIS
“Theory”

AECH
The challenge is unwinnable It’s
designed to drive us nuts
PARZIVAL
Halliday wouldn’t do that

ARTEMIS
Maybe he just made a mistake I
mean there was no one to bug test
it

AECH
No way he never made mistakes

PARZIVAL
Well not totally true

They both turn to look at him

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
He once screwed up a level of
Flunkie Sprat Three

ARTEMIS
Wow that is some seriously deep
cut triv Z I gotta admit you are
as hardcore a Halliday nerd as
anyone I’ve ever met

Parzival blushes a bit Aech notices this

AECH
We’re gunters “First to the
key”

PARZIVAL

“ first to the egg”
She looks from Parzival to Aech sizing them up

ARTEMIS
So how come you guys arent ina
clan

Parzival shakes his head

AECH
Thank you I’ve told him a million
times we’d be better off working
together But Z thinks the only way
someone wins is solo

ARTEMIS
Tell that to IOI and the Sixers

PARZIVAL
(quickly)
They won’t win Halliday won’t let
them

ARTEMIS
He’s dead dude

PARZIVAL
The Oasis was his baby He wouldn’t
set it up for some corporate borg-
spawn

AECH
(aside to Artemis)
He gets a little touchy about the
whole Halliday thing thinks they
have some sort of bond

PARZIVAL
No that’s not I just think I
understand the guy maybe
because

ALICE (0S)
WADE

Parzival is interrupted by a disembodied voice that echoes
out over the room though only he seems to hear it

ARTEMIS
Because why

ALICE (0S)
Wade Have you seen my gloves

PARZIVAL
Oh crap

Artemis looks at him quizzically
PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Sorry it was awesome meeting you
Gotta split
And with that PARZIVAL SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS

CUT TO

INT CARGO VAN - THE REAL WORLD

And now we see WADE WATTS the “real” Parzival in the real
world

He’s inside an 80’s vintage van with fogged over windows
wearing a HAPTIC VISOR which he quickly pulls off

“Parzival” is an idealized version of Wade in reality he is
shy and gangly sporting worn corduroys and a baggy sweater
And a pair of I0I-branded HAPTIC GLOVES

ALICE (0S)
They’re not on my desk Where they
should be

The conversation with his Aunt switches from the visor to a
mobile headset the size of a dime on his earlobe

Wade tucks the gloves into a backpack and scrambles out of
the van pushing past boxes of busted laptops computer parts
and old car batteries

EXT CARGO VAN - NIGHT
The VAN is buried under other junked vehicles arranged
perfectly so it’s hidden from the outside world Wade locks

the door behind him keeping the conversation going

WADE
Why would I take your gloves

ALICE (0S)
Because you spend every waking
moment in the Oasis and you don’t
have your own
EXT JUNKPILE - NIGHT
Wade emerges from the mound of old cars into an empty
playground He checks to make sure no one saw him come out of

his secret hideout then keeps moving

ALICE (0S)
Where are you anyway

WADE
I’m out with some friends

ALICE (0S)
You don’t have any friends
EXT PORTLAND AVENUE STACKS - NIGHT

Wade has now arrived at his destination THE STACKS

Dozens of MOBILE HOMES stacked on top of each other
connected by a makeshift network of recycled pipes girders
and support beams There are a dozen Stacks in all the
future’s version of suburban tract housing

WADE
I actually just met someone I
really like

ALICE (0S)
A real person
WADE
Funny
The lower trailers -- and other empty wall spaces -- are

punctuated with the occasional bit of political graffiti
Most of the references are to “IOI” an organization that
seems particularly unpopular with people who like writing
slogans on walls

As he runs through the streets he passes two kids wearing
“REB” t-shirts a picture of a leader called “JC3” in the
same vein as Che Guevara They take potshots at overhead IOI
DELIVERY DRONES with air rifles

They wing one of the drones which sputters and falls almost
hitting a stray dog

Wade MUTES his headset for a moment as he hustles past them

WADE (CONT’D)
What the hell guys

REB
IOI brah Gotta stop ‘em

WADE
By shooting someone’s tube socks
out of the sky

REB
Stuff it in your suckchute loser

WADE
(to himself)
Suckchute thats new

ALICE (0S)
Still need my gloves Wade

Wade jumps up and grabs on to the skeletal metal structure
that keeps the whole stack in place He starts CLIMBING

EXT WADE’S STACK - NIGHT

We follow Wade as he scrambles up the outside of the stack
The climb grows increasingly perilous as he goes Physically
Wade’s no specimen but this is one thing in the real world
that he is actually good at

WADE
Just remembered where they are

He finally reaches his unit He peers through the BATHROOM
WINDOW then climbs through it
INT WADE’S HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT
In the pitch dark bathroom Wade cracks the door and can now
see his AUNT ALICE 30’s and haggard in a meth-y kind of way
standing in the living room
WADE

They’re in the kitchen On top of

the fridge
Alice turns to look at the kitchen AWAY from Wade When she
starts to walk in that direction Wade makes his move
INT WADES HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Wade dashes into the messy cramped living room He quickly
stashes the gloves under the COUCH CUSHIONS then walks as
quietly as he can to the front door

Alice annoyed paces back into the living room

ALICE (INTO HEADSET)
I can’t be late again

just as Wade walks IN through the front door

WADE
They’re right there Alice

He points to the gloves sticking out from under the couch
cushions

WADE (CONTD)
See I didn’t have em

Alice slightly chastened takes the gloves from him then
settles into a recliner

RICK (0S)
That is bull pucky amigo

A FLUSH from the bathroom as RICK Alice’s white trash
boyfriend walks into the living room

Wade grimaces realizing

WADE
You were in there when
RICK
Fell asleep it was a long one
(to Alice)

This lying bastard had the gloves

Rick continues past them and into the kitchen Alice glares
at Wade

ALICE
Damnit Wade bad enough you don’t
have a job without screwing up
mine Now you can’t use ‘em at all

WADE
What But I

Alice waves him away slipping on her IOI gear She speaks
into her official IOI headset and waves her hands awkwardly

ALICE (INTO HEADSET)
(monotone )
This way please

Wade glares at Rick now tugging on a beer Rick shrugs

INT WADES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wade enters the tiny slice of the unit he calls his room
Outside his window like a cruel taunt is a giant billboard
advertising a SHAPTIC BRAND HAPTIC BOOTSUIT a totally
badass immersion rig for logging in to the Oasis

The BILLBOARD advertisement reads “Log In” and features a
muscular guy modeling a suit that promises “Total Interface”
and “Real-time Neuromuscular Response”

Hold on Wade staring up at that ad

INT WADE’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY (REAL WORLD)

Wade wakes up wipes the sleep from his eyes It might be
from spending too much time in the Oasis but there’s a
moment of hopefulness like maybe he’s someplace awesome

But nope same crappy apartment same billboard taunting him

INT WADE’S HOUSE - MORNING

Wade pours himself a bowl of cereal and milk water (milk-
flavored water) From the kitchen table through an open
door Wade can see into his aunt’s bedroom

Alice is passed out from a long night of work Rick lies
asleep on top of her drooling Wade cringes

CLOSE ON -- the HAPTIC GLOVES and VISOR sitting on Alice’s
desk They’re YANKED out of frame --

INT CARGO VAN - DAY (REAL WORLD)
Back in his hideout Wade slips his VISOR on then logs in

He sees the last three words anyone sees before leaving the
real world for the Oasis

READY PLAYER ONE

EXT CITY STREET -- THE OASIS

INCIPIO the MAIN PLANET of the Oasis is a giant city filled
with every building or structure real or fictional you can
possibly imagine

WADE (VO)
When Halliday first built the
Oasis it was an open-world
massively-multiplayer online game
Over time it grew into way more
than that

Parzival suddenly appears mid stride He passes the Eiffel
Tower next to the Taj Mahal with EXXONWHOLEFOODS corporate
headquarters jammed between them

WADE (VO)
One of his biggest ideas was tying
your avatar into your DNA using
their proprietary software One
account per person no exceptions
(MORE)

WADE (VO) (CONTD)
Everyone started equal in the
Oasis And it was free

Parzival opens his HUD his “heads up display” which appears
as a seamless interface with the world around him He has
gamer attributes -- SPEED STRENGTH MAGIC AIM -- and an
INVENTORY for weapons spells and vehicles

WADE (VO)
Your avatar was fully upgradeable
but that took experience And
money

The DELOREAN is in there currently marked “damaged” The
price to fix it is 5000 gold coins His account has a
balance of 4560

PARZIVAL
(using a voice command)
Locate Aech

An image of AECH comes up like the graphics over any sports
broadcast his avatar moves and poses and winks
“LOCATING” appears

Wade continues on his way passing through what looks like
the heart of the city Off to his right is the main
GREGARIOUS GAMES headquarters a gleaming castle-like tower

WADE (VO)
Once the Oasis took off Halliday’s
partner Ogden Morrow got pushed
out Since Halliday died no one
knew exactly who ran the Oasis
anymore But a good guess

Just down the block from Gregarious is IOI HEADQUARTERS a
massive corporate monstrosity

WADE (VO)
IOI Innovative Online Industries
They build the haptic gear The
gloves the visors

INT WADE’S HIDEOUT - THE REAL WORLD

Wade lies in his haptic rig a series of quick cuts of THE
IOI LOGO on Wade’s gloves visor the boots IOI has their

name on everything

EXT INCIPIO (OASIS)
Back in Incipio

WADE (VO)
Which means they control most
people’s access to the Oasis

Parzival checks his HUD Aech is still being “located”

WADE (VO)
Halliday kept IOI in line But now
Well if you asked the rebels IOI’s
plan was to turn the Oasis into a
hellish place where rules were
numerous and always followed

AECH (0S)
S’up Z

AECH now appears in a window in a close-up clearly real time
footage Wherever he is it’s loud and dusty and bursts of
smoke and gunfire make it difficult to see and hear

PARZIVAL
What the hell are you doing

AECH
Im trying to win the musket of
infinite velocity

WADE (VO)
But people loved the Oasis ‘cause
it was free At least in spirit
you could do anything

The camera suddenly TAKES OFF shooting away from Parzival

EXT OUTER SPACE --
And into OUTER SPACE

WADE (VO)
Halliday built an entire universe
something for everyone

We SHOOT ACROSS THE GALAXY passing countless planets

One of them seems to be a huge SPACECRAFT IMPOSSIBLY LARGE

But as we pass it we see that it is the LETTER “S” floating

in space The rest of the word is so big we can’t make it out
from this perspective

WADE (VO)
Which is how you end up with a
place like Planet Doom

We approach a planet that seems to have beautiful and
elaborate weather systems swirling around it As we get
closer we realize that the “weather” is actually EXPLOSIONS
from a never-ending war

WADE (VO)
The first gamers in the Oasis
walked around blowing each other
away right in front of everyone
else Halliday realized he needed
to draw some boundaries He divided
the Oasis into combat zones or
PVP and non-combat zones

As we descend from the atmosphere we pass over “The Dark
Side” of Planet Doom which is sealed off from the war zones
by a giant wall known as Anorak’s Fence

WADE (VO)

He migrated all the most violent
first person shooters to one
planet One giant PVP zone

EXT APPOMATTOX (OASIS)

We swoop in from the atmosphere to reveal a perfectly
rendered vision of the battle of Appomattox with some small
changes

PARZIVAL (0S)
Who you up against

Mixed in with the soldiers are a bunch of avatars that are
way out of context

AECH
The South But also Aliens And the
Roman Legion I think

Aech is on the Union side a musket with one hand and a
futuristic BLASTER in the other

PARZIVAL
Think I might’ve figured something
out Wanna swing by the journals
and take another run at the key

AECH
Wish I could

As he moves across the field Aech shoots an Alien with his
musket then a Confederate soldier with his blaster As they
explode their COINS shower to the ground A VACUUM TUBE on
Aech’s shoulder sucks them right into his inventory

AECH (CONTD)
This sesh has got another five
hours minimum DAMNIT

Aech just got winged in the ribs by an enchanted ARROW

WADE (VO)
Aech was my best friend in the
Oasis probably my best friend
period even though I’d never met
him

Aech launches himself into the fray racking up kills

WADE (VO)
He also had a lot of stuff
including a dope spaceship So I
was always hitting him up for
rides

EXT INCIPIO STREETS - THE OASIS

Aech’s window disappears so Parzival toggles his HUD to
navigation

PARZIVAL
(voice command)
Memoir-opolis

A pathway suddenly lights up in front of him showing him the
path to take

WADE (VO)
The Oasis was like the real world
in that respect the more money you
had the more stuff you got and
the more stuff the easier it was
to get around and thus get even
more stuff

Wade heads towards a train station The train tracks head UP
AND OFF THE PLANET

WADE (VO)
I think that’s why Halliday’s
challenge was such a big deal It
wasn’t just the money

(MORE)

WADE (VO) (CONTD)
For someone like me it was the
chance to go from peasant to king
in a heartbeat

Wade takes a seat on a bench at the train station waiting
for his ride

WADE (VO)
Like everyone else I remember
exactly where I was the day the
contest was announced the day
James Halliday died

FLASHBACK TO --

INT LUDUS -- OASIS

A giant virtual classroom PARZIVAL is one of a thousand
avatars sitting and listening to a virtual ALBERT EINSTEIN
teach them rudimentary science

Suddenly everyone in the room gets an alert

JAMES HALLIDAY DEAD AT 62

INT APARTMENT - DAY -- THE REAL WORLD

WADE 13 years old rips his early-iteration headset off His
eyes fill with tears

He is in his cozy childhood home There are boxes everywhere
the family has just moved in In the background his FATHER
paints the living room wall while his MOTHER cooks dinner

When she sees her boy crying she runs over to comfort him
Despite the tragedy clearly these were happier times for
Wade

EXT FUNERAL PARLOR (OASIS)

At a funeral parlor people dressed in black mourn before an
open casket

The body inside is JAMES HALLIDAY shiny quarters cover each
of his eyelids

WADE (VO)
But it wasn’t his death that
changed everything It was his
will

IN THE CASKET -- Halliday’s avatar suddenly SITS UPRIGHT and
begins talking to camera

HALLIDAY
Hello I’m James Halliday If
youre watching this I’m dead

He snaps his fingers and a SCROLL appears in his hand He
unfurls it to the floor and begins reading aloud

HALLIDAY (CONTD)
I James Donovan Halliday do
hereby declare this to be my last
will and testament

A CAPTION at the bottom of the screen reads

“Halliday’s Announcement”
(archival footage property of GGS)

INT ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)

Now Halliday appears inside a castle as ANORAK his avatar a
tall robed wizard with a slightly more handsome version of
Hallidays face

ANORAK
Before I died I created my own
Easter egg and hid it somewhere
inside the OASIS The first person
to find the egg will inherit my
entire fortune and earn complete
control of the Oasis

A simple RHYME appears as a subtitle in front of Halliday as
he speaks

HALLIDAY
Three hidden keys open three secret
gates Wherein the errant will be
tested for worthy traits And those
with the skill to survive these
straits Will reach the end where
the prize awaits Now here is the
clue for the first key

EXT TRAIN (OASIS)

Parzival boards a high-speed train His HUD IMAGE OF CREDITS
appears and is lightened by 10 coins Everything in the Oasis
costs something

He takes a seat next to two ridiculously proportioned WOMEN
who chat loudly Parzival MUTES them

WADE (VO)

The corporate overlords at IOI
weren’t as excited about the
contest

EXT COLUMBUS THE REAL WORLD --

Push in on three sleek skyscrapers in gleaming downtown
Columbus Ohio in the shape of the letters IOI

WADE (VO)
The thought of new ownership
terrified them

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS

Inside the building a sea of workers in rows of Haptic
Decks A buzzing hive of activity like a trading firm all
working to solve Anorak’s challenge

WADE (VO)
They started their own division of
egg hunters

We see all of the IOI EMPLOYEES AVATARS have the same default
outfits and instead of names NUMBERS All of them start with
a “six”

WADE (VO)

We call em “Sixers” ‘cause that’s
the rule no name just numbers
They put this Kardash named Nolan
Sorrento in charge

AN INTERVIEW -- with a slick ambitious guy in his forties
who is clearly trying to burnish his image

A chyron reads NOLAN SORRENTO EXECUTIVE VP IOI

WADE (VO)
Sorrento was the lead sixer The
face of IOIs team

The program CUTS TO Sorrento giving a tour of his lavish
home trying to show a more human side

SORRENTO
I love games I love being inside
the Oasis

Despite the fact that his whole house is luxurious his rig
is particularly ostentatious a rotating full body 3D
Immersive Haptic Interface like a hamster ball

SORRENTO (CONTD)
The one luxury I spoil myself with
is the best haptic immersion rig
money can buy

We see B-Roll of his enormous house his attractive FAMILY
His admittedly cute dog

WADE (VO)
Despite the charm offensive
Sorrento was a scary dude He made
his bones in IOI’s security and
adjustment division

EXT COLUMBUS SUBURBS -- FLASHBACK

A younger Nolan Sorrento leads a team of jack-booted IOI
thugs as they break down someone’s door A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL
with a DISTINCTIVE BIRTHMARK watches as Sorrento reads off a
list of debts to her FATHER then has him dragged out of the
house

The girl runs after her father Sorrento sticks out his foot
and TRIPS HER

WADE (VO)
Now he was in charge of IOI’s egg
hunt but you could tell his heart
wasn’t in it
INT SORRENTO’S HOME
Sorrento’s interview continues
SORRENTO
At IOI we love hunting for the
egg it’s part of what makes the

Oasis so fun

It’s the least convincing expression of enthusiasm ever

EXT INCIPIO (OASIS)

The TRAIN rockets up and out of the city impossibly fast

WADE (VO)
The first clue was easy some long-
forgotten gunter cracked it ina
week But the challenge -- the race
through Times Square -- was
incredibly hard

The train arrives at his stop one of the many moons of
Incipio A sign at the station reads MEMOIR-OPOLIS

WADE
Five years went by and no one came
close to beating it Most people
gave up The sixers couldn’t they
had no choice The rest of us the
Gunters as in “egg hunters”
well we didn’t have an excuse We
just had a dream

EXT OASIS -- MEMOIR-OPOLIS

Parzival strolls down a street lined with what look like
homes but are actually a row of “memory palaces” basically
auto-biographies represented in tangible form

WADE (VO)
At this point you’re probably
wondering why a nobody me is
telling you his life story

The “titles” of these “books” float in front of the memory

WADE (VO)
Point is this I tell my story
cause thats what Halliday did He
knew our lives would be
memorialized in the Oasis and
people like me would want to know

Parzival passes “OGDEN MORROW MY LIFE SO FAR”

Finally he comes to the building he’s looking for HALLIDAY’S
JOURNALS

WADE (VO)
And if that seems grandiose on my
part if this seems like some rand-
o day in the life of some rand-o
nobody it’s not This is the day I
stopped being a nobody

INT HALLIDAY’S JOURNALS - OASIS

Parzival enters a large lobby with many doors each of them
heading into a different part of Halliday’s life

THE HISTORIAN a doddering NPC with an attitude suddenly
appears before him (An NPC is a bot an AT)

HISTORIAN
Parzival How shocking to see you
here

PARZIVAL
What’s up not-real but sarcastic
program

HISTORIAN

So Halliday’s childhood again
Comb through his VHS library Chew
up my valuable search time

PARZIVAL
Nah today I need to check out
something pretty obscure
Halliday’s one mistake

The Historian raises an eyebrow intrigued

HISTORIAN
His mistake Flunkie Sprat Three

PARZIVAL
(nods)
Yeah This girl said something to
me I’ve been thinking about it all
day

HISTORIAN
I’m feigning interest

PARZIVAL
(ignoring that)
I mean maybe it’s cause she’s hot
(MORE )

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
If she had said “I love pork
rinds” would I be thinking about
pork rinds Possibly

HISTORIAN

Please go on I’m fascinated
He isn’t

PARZIVAL
Damn now I am thinking about pork
rinds

HISTORIAN
Is that the end Great story
Parzival

PARZIVAL
My point is what if he made a
mistake

INT HALLIDAY’S JOURNALS - HALLWAY

The Historian leads Parzival to a door Parzival opens it and
steps inside

PARZIVAL
With the contest I mean What if
he made a mistake on purpose

INT GREGARIOUS GAMES -- 1993 (THE REAL WORLD)

But for the presence of Parzival and the Historian the
recreation is absolutely flawless We ARE in 1993 in the
offices of Gregarious Games where a much younger James
Halliday hung over can’t stop talking about his night

HALLIDAY
She’s incredible Ogden I mean
I never met anyone like her I
drank too much like an idiot I’m
a total lightweight

A frustrated OGDEN MORROW rotund with an unruly beard and
wire-rimmed spectacles is Halliday’s partner He inspects
the code Halliday has written for PD3

MORROW
(re the code)
What did you do here

HALLIDAY
She told me to call her Do I do
that tomorrow When I’m terrible
at this stuff

MORROW
Data is leaking all over the place

HALLIDAY
I really do wonder why people
bother with relationships it’s
incredibly messy and confusing

MORROW
Yeah partnerships are that way
too

Morrow pushes back from the desk

MORROW (CONTD)
You blew it this time Hal

HALLIDAY
I got the level finished

MORROW
Oh it’s finished With one minor
bug You did it backwards Flunkie
starts at the end and sprats his
way backwards to the beginning

HALLIDAY
Can’t we just reverse the

PARZIVAL (0S)
STOP

The scene suddenly freezes Parzival turns to the Historian

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Play again from minor bug

MORROW
minor bug You did it
backwards

Hold on Parzival wide eyed

INT CARGO VAN - THE REAL WORLD

Wade suddenly yanks the haptic visor off breathing heavily
He’s got it

EXT ANORAKS RACE - OASIS

A new crowd of RACERS wait at the starting line with their
cars

Aside from the usual indistinguishable sixers we see SHOTO
and DAITO Both are Japanese in their twenties bearing a
striking resemblance to one another They each wear matching
suits of traditional samurai armor a short wakizashi and
longer katana strapped to their belts They also drive
matching Speed Racer cars

Parzival walks towards his DeLorean in the center lane

SHOTO
Hey Parzival what‘s up

They speak in Japanese which we hear faintly because it is
instantly translated to English

PARZIVAL

Shoto Daito
SHOTO

Dude you’re in the newb lane
PARZIVAL

Just testing out a new engine Aech

threw in

Daito nods Shoto seems unconvinced Parzival gives the
gunter salute

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
First to the key

SHOTO DAITO
First to the egg First to the egg

AT THE STARTING LINE --

The race begins with a gunshot and instantly Shoto Daito and
the Sixers speed off

Parzival’s DeLorean doesn’t move

As the rest of the racers disappear around a curve Parzival
puts his car in REVERSE and drives backward and then

EXT SEWER SYSTEM - OASIS

The ground gives way and the DeLorean lands with a thump in
the sewer system Parzival stomps on the accelerator and the
car AUTOMATICALLY GOES BACKWARDS

Parzival laughs as he shoots through a winding tunnel

Then the sewer ramps UP and the DeLorean shoots out back into
the race

EXT RACE TRACK - OASIS

As he emerges and because he is driving backwards Parzival
can instantly see that he is way ahead of the pack and EVERY
OBSTACLE in the game is FALLING BEHIND HIM

He can see the T-REX licking its claws and waiting on 54th
street the CRANE not yet toppled the CEMENT TRUCK not yet
moving He can even see the TRAIL OF THE METEOR on a
trajectory towards the park

It doesn’t matter it’s all behind him He sees Shoto and
Daito crash then glances in his rearview He’s just entered
Central Park

EXT CENTRAL PARK - OASIS

The DeLorean SPINS OUT and ends up facing forward RIGHT AT
BETHESDA FOUNTAIN

Parzival gets out As he walks towards the fountain he calls
AECH up in a video-chat window

AECH
What’s up 2

PARZIVAL
Aech my good friend

AECH
Where are you

PARZIVAL
Great question Do you recognize
this

PARZIVAL flips AECH to HIS POV
AECH

WAIT Bethesda Fountain No Oh my
god Dude You made it

As Parzival walks around the fountain interference causes
his HUD to disappear hanging up on Aech Probably because
he’s so close to

THE COPPER KEY

Parzival snatches it out of the air He stares at the key for
a long moment then cant resist HE HOLDS IT UP LIKE
EXCALIBUR

PARZIVAL
I am PARZIVAL

His bellow echoes out over the park He feels a bit stupid
for a second Then a DOOR APPEARS

Parzival sticks the key in and the door opens As he does
we WHIP AROUND THE OASIS in what some might call

A MONTAGE

EXT OASIS

Aech is standing on a distant planet impatiently waiting for
a TRANSPORT SPOT to open up

A BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE SKY draws his attention

It’s the scoreboard There’s a name at the top now
Parzival If Aech had programmed his avatar to cry it would
INT PLANET DOOM

Artemis is in a private chat room -- unlike Aech’s it is
austere and functional -- with her GUNTER CLAN Conversation
is hushed secretive Then a KNOCK at the door startles them
everyone pulls their weapons (various guns and blasters and

knives)

Artemis checks the peephole It’s one of her clan members
excitedly knocking on the door

GUNTER
Arty Ya gotta come check this out
EXT PLANET DOOM

Artemis steps outside and appears next to her clan mate
Planet Doom is experiencing a rare momentary peace

Artemis looks up to see why It’s the Scoreboard

ARTEMIS
Ho lee

She smiles ear to ear As we zoom to our next location

CUT TO

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS - BOARD ROOM

A massive VIRTUAL BOARD MEETING is taking place NOLAN
SORRENTO’s avatar is making a presentation about “The Loyalty
Initiative” a program that involves the construction of
multiple LOYALTY CENTERS around the world

On an interactive MAP we see there’s one in Columbus one in
Oklahoma City and many more planned Then

Something catches Sorrento’s eye Out the window His voice
drifts off

EXT IOI CORPORATE SKY DECK - NIGHT
SORRENTO walks out onto an outdoor executive deck He can see
that THOUSANDS OF SIXERS have filed out into the courtyard

below all gazing and pointing at the sky like extras in a
Spielberg film He looks up to see

FULL REVEAL -- THE SCOREBOARD shining brightly in the night
sky above

There are ten spaces that for five years have been empty
But now

1ST PLACE PARZIVAL -- 100000 POINTS

Just to hear it said Sorrento repeats the single name that
has suddenly jeopardized everything he believes in

SORRENTO
Parzival

CUT TO

EXT INCIPIO - DAY

Parzival suddenly appears on a street on Incipio the key
hanging around his neck

It takes him a moment to notice then he realizes that
everyone is staring up in the sky pointing He looks up to
see his name up there as big as the sun

Parzival is absorbing the magnitude of this when his HUD
suddenly comes up and his COIN COUNTER shoots from 827 to
100000 Instantly

PARZIVAL
Sweet Mama Cass

Then his message queue pops up He has over fifty thousand
messages waiting for him the number jumps by another
thousand every second

PARZIVAL (CONT’D)
Hello World

Then he hears voices

VOICES
Parzival Look Parzival It’s him

He’s been spotted
Parzival laughs as he is surrounded by AVATARS all looking
for a word or a chance to look at the key or even just a

moment next to the most famous man in the Oasis

FADE OUT

INT WADES HOME - SOMETIME LATER (REAL WORLD)

In stark contrast to the Oasis in real life Wade sits in his
Aunt’s apartment in the Stacks drumming his fingers

Waiting

HIS POV -- Aunt Alice wearing their only haptic deck is
working pointing left and right

CUT TO

EXT STACKS - DAY (REAL WORLD)

Wade burning off nervous energy walks around the Stacks
checking the time and occasionally glancing at the sky

INT WADE’S APARTMENT -- LATER (REAL WORLD)

RICK is now wearing the haptic deck playing some sort of
lame first person shooter He contorts his body and complains
as he keeps getting shot

RICK
That’s bullshit You didn’t hit me
You’re cheating This game is
friggin’ rigged

WADE watches mutely from the kitchen No way he can get back
online It’s like a nightmare

EXT WADE’S STACK (REAL WORLD)

Wade is now standing outside the stacks checking the time
and watching the skies The REB KIDS are spray-painting the

side of a stack

REB
Hey look it’s the loser

REB 2
Eat a dickbagel loser

Wade looks over at the kids and double takes
Their t-shirts A PICTURE OF PARZIVAL holding up the JADE
KEY Someone’s screengrab that they printed up and sold It

causes Wade to burst out laughing

WADE
Nice shirts

REB 2
They are nice butt-chee

REB
What’s so funny

WADE
You mostly

Wade notices a DRONE dropping from the sky heading towards
them One of the reb kids grabs his air rifle

Wade snatches it out of his hands

WADE (CONTD)
Don’t even think about it

The kids are taken aback by Wade’s sudden confidence

The drone lands beside Wade and a signature screen pops up
Wade signs it and the package releases

REB
Those arent socks

WADE
Youre a pair of socks Get out of
here
Wade tosses them the air gun The kids run away Amazing what
a little confidence will do
INT WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)

Like a kid on Christmas Day Wade tears open the package

It’s the SHAPTIC BRAND HAPTIC BOOTSUIT the same one he’s
been looking at every day out his window

WADE
Oh yes my sweet sweet love

He hugs the suit to his chest the happiest kid in the world

EXT WHITE SANDS - OASIS

Nolan Sorrento’s avatar stands in the middle of an enormous
white sand desert He waits impatiently when suddenly

A SPACESHIP DROPS DOWN in front of him kicking up a cloud of
sand It looks similar to SLAVE 1 Boba Fett’s ship from Star
Wars but not so similar that a lawsuit could be filed

A MASSIVE WARRIOR emerges from the ship A SPACE KNIGHT all
in black weapons bristling across his body Imagine the
Hound from Game of Thrones crossed with a goth Master Chief
from Halo

SORRENTO
Six old friend how are you

This is NUMBER SIX an Oasis Bounty Hunter and he is scary
as shit except for his voice It’s incongruously nasal and
unintimidating

NUMBER SIX
I’m okay I’ve got a neck thing
some sort of carpal tunnel deal but
in your neck So if you could stay
on this side of me

He motions for Sorrento to step to his left

SORRENTO
Yeah sure

NUMBER SIX
Thanks just the repetitive stress
you know

SORRENTO
I get it I have a job for you
Six

NUMBER SIX

Yeah kinda figured that when you
sent me the message about having a
job for me Who’s the target

Sorrento flings a “DATA PACKET” at Six It instantly unfolds
into a HUD filled with info

NUMBER SIX (CONTD)
Duh Should’ve seen that coming

IN THE HUD -- All known information about PARZIVAL Not just
the obvious stuff like his status as leader of the
challenge this has his entire Oasis history all his
achievements every XP hunt power-up purchase porn planet
visit it’s all there Everything except his real world
identity

NUMBER SIX (CONTD)
Not gonna be easy Guy’s got a lot
of eyes on him

SORRENTO
That’s why I came to you You’re
the best

NUMBER SIX
Riiight

Six pushes the data aside

NUMBER SIX (CONTD)
Before I bust my ass how many
other haxorz have you put on this

SORRENTO
Six why would I hire anyone else
You’re my guy

NUMBER SIX
Yeah okay well I’m gonna need a
higher daily budget than usual And
I’m gonna need help as in
manpower

SORRENTO
The Sixer Army is at your disposal

NUMBER SIX
I said “help” not a bunch of
deadbeat level-one shart-squirters
to trip over

SORRENTO
If you think it’s too difficult

NUMBER SIX
Yeah yeah You can skip the mind
games Nolan You know I’m in

The giant warrior turns and heads back to his ship

SIX
Owww

He moans and grabs his neck as he boards

EXT DEEP SPACE -- NIGHT

Aech’s Spaceship rockets through the Oasis away from the
galaxy’s center towards the less populated rim

BECH (0S)
I like your facial expressions
Much more detailed

INT AECH’S SPACESHIP

Aech and Parzival are hanging in the cockpit of Aech’s sweet
ride talking about Wade’s new Shaptic Brand Bootsuit

PARZIVAL
Think so

AECH
Yeah but was it worth it Those
rigs are pricey

PARZIVAL
I can feel the Corinthian leather
under my ass that’s how sensitive
this thing is

AECH
Worth it Changed my mind

Aech gives Parzival a triple-slap high-five which in the
2040s is the cool way to do it

EXT VENDOR’S MOON --

Aech’s spaceship descends towards a MOON that looks like it
is made entirely from WOOD

INT VENDOR’S WORKSHOP - DAY

In the center of an enormous space that makes the warehouse
at the end of Raiders look like a closet a man known only as
the VENDOR (played by DAVID CROSS because literally this is
a David Cross branded avatar with maximum sarcasm enabled)
constructs a personalized PLANET MADONNA’S 100th BIRTHDAY
WORLD

He uses his right hand to shape and mold his left to add
texture and color Bits of color and pixels of matter fall to
the ground like glitter

He finishes off an ERUPTING VOLCANO and places it in the
center of an ocean Without turning around

VENDOR
Where’s my robot Aech

Reveal Aech and Parzival approaching from a distance

AECH
Hey man someone I want you

VENDOR
Where is my Giant Robot Aech
From the movie Iron Giant a
heartwarming tale about a
friendship between a human boy and
a Giant Robot

AECH
I’m working

VENDOR
Where is it Why don’t I have it
Did we not say I would have it this
week

AECH
(quickly)
This is Parzival

VENDOR
You if what
(to Parzival)
The Parzival

PARZIVAL
That’s me

VENDOR
So what are we after a used
planet Real estate in an
undeveloped solar system

The Vendor grabs a sheaf of paper from off a table and
UNFURLS it It stretches out into an enormous stunning ONE
HUNDRED FOOT LONG MAP of every planet in the Oasis

PARZIVAL
No thanks

VENDOR
How about your own signage floating
in the rings of Googleworld I have
a signsmith with fonts that will
literally make you cry

PARZIVAL
I just need a ship Something fast

The Vendor smiles snaps the map closed

VENDOR
Spaceships are my jam

INT WORKSHOP

The contents of a SHOEBOX are dumped on a worktable
matchbox size versions of the Starship Enterprise the
Battlestar Galactica and other iconic spacecraft

VENDOR
I just got a wonderful Guild spice
ship that folds space like a boss

Parzival shakes his head

VENDOR (CONTD)
How about this George Melies-
inspired stop-motion-esque rocket
Very classy

PARZIVAL
Kind of had my heart set on this
one

He picks up “Serenity” the spaceship from the show
“Firefly” The Vendor frowns

VENDOR
Oh joy another Whedonite
Personally I never saw the appeal
insular and twee and smug Still
can’t deny it’s a well built
vessel

INT VENDOR’S WORKSHOP - LATER

The “Vonnegut” as Parzival has renamed it is now complete
He circles it inspecting it from every angle

PARZIVAL
It’s amazing

VENDOR
So you really did it You got the
first key

PARZIVAL
Course

VENDOR
Can I see it

Parzival turns to look at the Vendor He seems desperate

VENDOR (CONTD)
I’m not gonna go Gollum on you
kid

PARZIVAL
Okay sure

Parzival takes the key from around his neck and hands it to
him The Vendor’s eyes light up as he turns the key over in
his hands

VENDOR
The Copper Key See how perfect
that is down to the pixel Highest
density resolution just amazing
work

In fact the key is magnificent like it somehow has more
weight and catches more light than anything else around it

VENDOR (CONTD)
I wondered if anyone would find it
He would have been happy to see
someone like you holding this
instead of those IOI beefjugglers

PARZIVAL
Wait did you know Halliday

VENDOR
In some ways yes

The Vendor looks over his shoulder to make sure Aech isn’t
listening

VENDOR (CONTD)
I want to give you something You
have to promise not to tell Aech
he would be furiously jealous

PARZIVAL
Yeah sure

The Vendor rummages in his pockets Parzival’s excitement
grows he can only imagine what it could be this is a guy
who can make anything

VENDOR
Here you go

The Vendor drops a single quarter in Parzival’s hand

VENDOR (CONTD)
Remember don’t tell anyone

As the Vendor walks away Parzival looks down at the measly
quarter and laughs He flips it then adds it to his
INVENTORY

INT VONNEGUT - DAY (OASIS)

Wade straps into the driver’s seat of the Vonnegut The ship
rockets through the open bay door of the planetoid and
accelerates into space

INT WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)

Wade in his full body bootsuit is taking the thrill ride of

his life He steers with a virtual wheel accelerates with a
virtual thrust flips switches on a virtual switchboard

INT THE VONNEGUT (OASIS)

All of which is rendered in loving detail inside the
Vonnegut Parzival deftly navigates two oncoming ships a
massive GROUPON DEAL-HAULER and some tween girl’s HELLO KITTY
shuttle then loops through the BROKEN RINGS of the FACEBOOK
PLANET which has been dormant for years

PARZIVAL
“The place where lovers couldn’t
leap In the dark while counting
sheep Take the jump prove how
you’re made Then you will find the
key of Jade” That mean anything
to you Kitt

The voice of his onboard computer KITT responds

KITT (0S)
No sir

Parzival puts the ship on autopilot then calls up a map in
his HUD

PARZIVAL
Clearly some sort of jump So many
options Set a course for Lovers
Leap in the Valentine’s Day sector
on Hallmark 4

KITT (0S)
Very good sir

As the ship hurtles through space his HUD operates like a
FIND FRIENDS app showing that ARTEMIS is nearby on PLANET
DOOM

PARZIVAL
Locate

His Hud spins for a moment but Artemis isn’t available He
leaves a message

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Hey it’s me Z Ha ha that
rhymed

He abruptly stops and DELETES the message He tries again

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Howdy
(disgusted with himself)
What the hell am I a cowboy now
Act like a human being Wade

Now he gets his shit together

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Artemis it’s Z I’m in your neck
of the woods thought maybe I’d
drop by Anyway I wanna thank you
for helping me figure out the first
challenge So here’s me helping you
out Go backwards And let’s meet
up sometime You know just to hang
or whatever

He pauses for a moment wondering if he should do this Then
he SENDS the message

EXT THE VONNEGUT --

The Vonnegut suddenly rockets forward As it does reveal
that another craft SPEEDS UP AS WELL not quite as fast
clearly trying not to be seen

INT SLAVE 6 --
The interior of Number Six’s ship reveals a one-man bounty
hunting operation He has a live surveillance feed of the
Vonnegut simultaneous from five different angles
He’s also got what must be an ILLEGAL FEED of PARZIVAL’S
personal heads up display though no sound THE MESSAGE TO
ARTEMIS becomes visible as it FIRES FROM THE VONNEGUT
NUMBER SIX
(voice command)

Lock me on to that bitch Slave

The Slave Six SUDDENLY LEAPS INTO PURSUIT OF THE MESSAGE

EXT SPACE -- THE OASIS

The race between Parzival’s message and Six in his spaceship
is so fast that the ship itself appears as A MASSIVE BLUR
INT SLAVE 6

But the result is that for as long as he can keep up with the

message Six can ACTUALLY HEAR IT It’s warped and broken
into pieces but still audible

PARZIVAL
figure out the first
challenge returning the favor

Six smiles despite the G-force distorting his face He’s onto
something and he knows it

CUT TO

INT AECH’S BASEMENT

Aech is putting the finishing touches on the IRON GIANT lost
in his work

Aech turns on him
AECH
You told her I can’t believe you

PARZIVAL
I don’t know what
AECH
Have you seen the board Artemis is

on it

Aech snaps open a window A live feed of The Scoreboard
reveals Artemis’s name in the number two position

PARZIVAL
Oh Yeah Well I just felt like

AECH
That’s not why you gave her the
clue Man I can’t believe it What
happened to “Guy Friend before
Female you want to Date” And how
much have I helped you

PARZIVAL
Dude I’m sorry Ill totally give

AECH

I don’t want it okay Ill figure

Parzival’s call alert starts beeping He’s too embarrassed to
answer it

BECH (CONTD)
Well You just gonna let it ring

PARZIVAL
Probably vid-spam

AECH
It’s her isn’t it Don’t be a
tool answer it

PARZIVAL
Nah she’s just a girl man

AECH
ANSWER IT

ON SCREEN -- A message from Artemis “Let’s meet up”
Parzivals thrilled Aech is annoyed
AECH (CONTD)
She could be using you in fact SHE
could actually be a HE Think about

Parzival frowns he hadn’t thought of that

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS - REAL WORLD

An excited Nolan Sorrento on his headset practically runs
through the Sixer department at IOI

SORRENTO
Backwards Are you sure

NUMBER SIX (0OS)
I watched her get the key

Sorrento runs into the main SIXER BULLPEN There are dozens
of Sixers sitting in a hundred top-of-the-line immersion
rigs A monitor above each rig shows us (and Sorrento)
exactly what the Sixer in the Oasis is experiencing

Sorrento whistles loud enough that everyone turns to look
his way

SORRENTO
Listen up Backwards That’s your
clue First one to finish the race
raise your hand

The Sixers jump back into action Sorrento returns to his
voice link conversation with Number Six

SORRENTO (CONTD)
What do we know about this girl

NUMBER SIX
Coming your way

Sorrento taps the monitor closest to him A single touch
scans his ID and instantly displays the information Number
Six is sending him

NUMBER SIX (CONTD)
Name’s Artemis She’s got a geek
cute thing going She’s also got a
serious rap sheet

ON THE MONITOR --

A list of every achievement and infraction committed by the
avatar named Artemis

NUMBER SIX (CONTD)
Board bans game suspensions
digital vandalism politics in a no
politics zone Anti-IOI doxxing

Six lets out a laugh

SORRENTO
What’s so funny

On the monitor one of Artemis’s Oasis crimes is displayed
She is TEABAGGING an NPC in COMPUTER CHESS but her gamertag

NOLAN SORRENTO

SORRENTO (CONTD)
That’s not funny

SIX
Kinda funny Anyway I think I
found Parzival’s weak spot

SORRENTO
You did
Sorrento’s eyes linger on the picture of ARTEMIS

SORRENTO (CONTD)

It’s her
NUMBER SIX
What No It’s spaceships
SORRENTO
Shell get you what you’re after
SIXER (0S)
Mr Sorrento I’m in Central Park
sir
SORRENTO

Don’t let me down Six

Sorrento hangs up and walks over to the immersion rigs He
tugs on the arm of the Sixer who just yelled

SORRENTO (CONT’D)
Come on get out

Sorrento yanks the surprised Sixer’s visor off and puts it on
himself then climbs into his rig We notice a special THUMB
CAP that clicks in to the gloves and now the interface
reads

LOGGING IN NOLAN SORRENTO

INT OASIS - CENTRAL PARK

Sorrento now stands in front of Bethesda Fountain in Central
Park The copper key just floats there waiting for him
Sorrento reaches out and GRABS IT

SORRENTO
Booyah

Then he looks around to make sure no one heard that

EXT SCOREBOARD

The Scoreboard huge beyond comprehension begins to rumble
and shake as a new name rolls out into THIRD PLACE

The Vonnegut streaks past just a speck in the foreground

INT VONNEGUT

Parzival watches in disgust as the THIRD SLOT on the
scoreboard changes to the name “NOLAN SORRENTO”

Feeling guilty Parzival pulls up Aech in his contacts
There’s no response so Parzival leaves a message

PARZIVAL
I’m sorry I should’ve said
something you’re my best friend
Here’s how to beat the first
challenge

And while he explains

EXT STREETS OF PLANET DOOM

Artemis is making her way through the streets of Planet Doom
Her armor meter is high enough that she doesn’t need to worry
about crossfire The occasional bullet or shell pings off her
and falls to the ground

Then she notices someone following her It’s IOI Security

She speeds up a little then walks right past the entrance to
her CLAN CLUBHOUSE hoping to lose the tail She turns a
corner

EXT PLANET DOOM - NIGHT

TWO IOI security guards come around a corner only to be
JUMPED by ARTEMIS She is completely bad-ass in the Oasis
and makes quick work of them with some insane martial arts
moves combined with a BLASTER that she uses with deadly
accuracy

More Security Guards close in firing more ordinance
Artemis’s shields are starting to take damage She has to
retreat

EXT ALLEY -- PLANET DOOM
Artemis is PINNED DOWN in an alley IOI Security closing in
from both directions She ducks out from behind garbage cans

returning fire but in a few moments she’1ll be overwhelmed

PARZIVAL (0S)
Hey Artemis

Artemis looks up to see Parzival standing on a ledge above
her wearing A PAIR OF RED HEADPHONES He tosses her a
matching pair

PARZIVAL (CONT’D)
Put these on

She puts them on and them Parzival pulls out a supremely bad-
ass RAIL GUN

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Just bought this puppy Check ‘er
out

Parzival fires and the gun spits out a super-heated light
wave that sprays like a shotgun The blast incinerates
everything in its path except Artemis who stands in the
center of it unharmed

An impressed Artemis looks up at Parzival
PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Headphones of limitless protection

Keep em those are my spares

Parzival jumps down to the alley to join her a fine mist of
vaporized IOI goons whirls through the air

PARZIVAL (CONT’D)
So what was that all about

ARTEMIS
Long story Let’s get off the
streets

Parzival nods happy to As they walk away

Reveal a HOODED FIGURE watching them from afar He follows

EXT SAFE ZONE -- PLANET DOOM

A comically thin strip of sidewalk is the only safe zone on
Planet Doom

ARTEMIS
Don’t know if I told you this but
I like your look

PARZIVAL
You do
ARTEMIS
Yeah I mean the Atari Game burial
t-shirt very cool Also I like
that you’re not all ‘roided out

PARZIVAL
Yeah I hate that
ARTEMIS
Your friend
PARZIVAL
I’ve tried to talk to him about
it
ARTEMIS
The shoulders
PARZIVAL
Too wide right
ARTEMIS
Totally I mean nothing personal
but even your arms are a little

big

Parzival checks out his arms

PARZIVAL
Are they

ARTEMIS
For your frame I’m just saying
the biceps are kind of BAM

Parzival’s biceps instantly shrink down a bit
ARTEMIS (CONTD)
There you go a little less Olympic
weightlifter

Parzival smiles motions to Artemis

PARZIVAL
I like yours too I mean your
arms but I mean like your butt
it’s not

ARTEMIS

Yeah tried to keep it real

PARZIVAL
And your you know your boobs
they’re not those ridiculous porn
star

ARTEMIS

Those things are a huge liability
in a death match You try to hide
but your cans are sticking out from
behind a tree

PARZIVAL
Yeah

They walk in comfortable silence definitely a connection
forming

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
What do you look like in the real
world

ARTEMIS
Hey Boundaries not cool

PARZIVAL
Yeah I’m sorry I just it would
be you know to meet you In

person
ARTEMIS

Youd be disappointed
PARZIVAL

No I wouldnt

(then)

Are you a guy
ARTEMIS

No
PARZIVAL

I’m just saying I don’t care what
you look like I’d like to meet
you I mean I have no idea where
you live and I’m sure youd be
disappointed in me but

ARTEMIS
Shhh

Artemis motions to more IOI SECURITY GUARDS up ahead
searching for their missing quarry They duck behind a
billboard advertising MADDEN 74

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
Parzival listen

PARZIVAL
My real name is Wade

ARTEMIS
No Are you crazy You can’t tell
anyone who you are

PARZIVAL
I’m not telling anyone I’m telling
you

ARTEMIS

And you don’t know me you don’t
know anything about me IOI is
after me they’re definitely after
you This isn’t a game Z

PARZIVAL
Uh yeah I think it is

ARTEMIS
Well you’re wrong It’s not

A hovering graphic up ahead indicates END OF NON PVP ZONE
Artemis stops

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
Z seriously what would you do if
you found the egg

Parzival is taken aback almost like he hasn’t really thought
this through

PARZIVAL
I don’t know I mean what wouldn’t
I do Buy myself the best rig the
biggest space ship I’d get all
the shit I could never afford

ARTEMIS
And what about the Oasis

PARZIVAL
Id keep it like it is I guess
like it should be

ARTEMIS
That’s the thing Z it isn’t how
it should be Not anymore Whoever
wins this they’re going to need to
work to keep things free

PARZIVAL
Im not really that into politics

ARTEMIS
Its more than politics its basic
human decency IOI has all this
double speak about “maximizing
bandwidth potential” but what it
really means is the Oasis is
screwed

PARZIVAL
Yeah I guess

ARTEMIS
That’s why it’s so important that
we win We need you Z My clan
needs you

Parzival suddenly realizes

PARZIVAL
Oh Oh man
ARTEMIS
What
PARZIVAL
Aech was right I’m an idiot
(embarrassed)
I thought I thought you wanted
to hang
ARTEMIS

(not getting it)
I want to do more than hang I want
to clan up

PARZIVAL
That’s not-- nevermind It’s cool
I better go

He pulls the miniature Vonnegut out of his pocket and TOSSES
it into the middle of the street It instantly expands to
full size Artemis is confused by his sudden attitude

ARTEMIS
Wait so what’s your answer

PARZIVAL
Lemme think about it okay

Artemis bewildered just watches as his ship rockets away

Watching all this from a distance the figure who was
following them removes his hood

It’s NUMBER SIX

CUT TO

INT WADES BEDROOM - DAY (THE REAL WORLD)

Wade is sleeping in his tiny room when he hears pounding on
his door

RICK (0S)
Wade Get out here

Wade pulls some pants on heads out of his room

INT WADE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Wade walks into the living room to find Alice and Rick
waiting for him They’ve got his backpack open on the table

ALICE
Wade Can you explain this

Rick wearing a “Parzival” hat that makes Wade doubletake
holds up Wades fancy Bootsuit

WADE
Can I explain why you guys are
going through my stuff No I
can’t

Wade tries to grab the bootsuit but Rick holds him back

RICK
This thing costs at least ten
thousand credits Where’d you get
the money

ALICE
Did you steal it

WADE
I bought it
RICK

You doing those sex chats

WADE
What No Ew Why do you care
anyway Rick You don’t even live

here

RICK
Neither do you

ALICE
Rick

RICK
What

WADE

Alice What’s he talking about

ALICE
We’re selling the trailer Wade

She slides a LOYALTY CENTER PAMPHLET towards Wade Its got
the IOI logo on it and reads ‘Work off your debt in weeks
at Oklahoma Citys new Loyalty Center

Wade leafs through the pamphlet in shock

WADE
Is this a joke I don’t want to
live in this ass-y gulag

RICK
You’re not gonna live there We
didn’t apply for you

WADE
What

Wade stares at Alice looking for an answer

WADE (CONT’D)
What am I supposed to do

ALICE
You’re getting a little too old not
to have your own place I think
your Mom would have wanted

WADE
Don’t you dare bring my Mom into
this Alice

Wade looks really upset Alice feeling bad takes him aside

ALICE
I’m sorry Wade I know it’s rough
I just don’t know what else to do
It’s really hard to find someone
you can bear to be with

WADE
But Rick

ALICE
We don’t always get our first
choice kiddo
Alice hands Wade her IOI gear
ALICE (CONTD)
(whispering)
Here take my stuff I don’t want
to leave you with nothing

Reluctantly he takes it

EXT STACKS - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

A dejected Wade trudges through the stacks backpack over one
shoulder headed for his hideout

As he goes we hold on a shadowy figure WATCHING HIM He’s a
big guy in a hoodie with a really LAME TATTOO He watches
Wade disappear into the piled up cars

CUT TO

EXT OBSERVATION DECK - THE OASIS -- DAY

A rail runs along the edge of a deck that hangs in the upper
atmosphere Wind whips furiously and we reveal Parzival
standing on the edge He looks ready to jump

He sees Aech approaching

PARZIVAL
Thanks for finally returning my
calls

AECH

I looked deep in my heart and
realized you’re my best friend
How can I stay angry

Aech looks over the edge It’s at least ten thousand feet to
the ground

AECH (CONT’D)
Plus you sounded kind of bummed
when we talked

PARZIVAL
Yeah I guess I am

As if to prove his point Parzival JUMPS OFF THE EDGE

EXT SKY - FALLING -- OASIS
Parzival free-falls A moment later Aech joins him

AECH
So you gotta move out

PARZIVAL
I mean they didn’t give me any
warning

AECH
That’s rough How’d it go with the
girl

Parzival shakes his head

PARZIVAL
Don’t ask

Yes they are still hurtling towards the ground at terminal
velocity but the conversation is as casual as if they were
chatting over coffee

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
I don’t really know anyone Where
do I even go Where do I log in
Can’t believe my Aunt is doing
this

AECH
You dont get to choose your
family But Im your friend even
in the RW So if you need help
you call me okay

Parzival looks over at Aech Despite the fact that he looks
like a linebacker and is falling through space at high speed
he can see the sincerity behind his words

PARZIVAL
Thanks dude

AECH
Now pull your ripcord

They pull their chutes

EXT OASIS - LANDING SPOT

Parzival and Aech leave the RED BULL GLUTEN-PACKED ENERGY
LEAP the promotional jump they just tested out

AECH
So this wasn’t it The second
challenge

PARZIVAL
Nope

AECH
I’ve tried like ten different
famous jumps

PARZIVAL
I don’t think that’s the answer

They arrive at Aech’s ship which is incongruously sitting in
a parking lot among many other vehicles

AECH
Meaning

PARZIVAL
I just don’t think the clue is that
literal

Aech climbs on board his ship

AECH
Need a lift

Parzival shakes his head AECH throws him the gunter salute
BECH (CONTD)
Cheer up dude You’re still on the
board
AECH’S SHIP BLASTS OFF

And once it does

A GROUP OF SIXERS ARE REVEALED five of them with one very
familiar leader recognizable even through the smoke

SORRENTO (0S)
It’s good to meet you in person
Parzival I’m a fan

Seeing NOLAN SORRENTO Parzival immediately draws his GUNS
and his SHIELDS power up Sorrento walks forward

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Whoa take it easy Hombre None of
us are armed

IN PARZIVAL’S HUD -- a quick scan reveals that he’s telling
the truth no weapons on any of them

PARZIVAL
What do you want

SORRENTO
To make you an offer

PARZIVAL
Not interested

SORRENTO
This is the kind of offer where you
get everything you’ve ever dreamed
of

Sorrento motions to a gleaming blue TRANSPORT DISC the
fastest and most expensive way to get around the Oasis

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Five minutes just hear me out
that’s all I ask

Off Parzival debating whether to step onto that platform

EXT IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS - DAY

The IOI executive transport sits on a gated platform at one
end of the Courtyard in One IOI Plaza Sorrento Parzival and
the Sixers zap in

SORRENTO
I understand why people don’t like
IOI I really do Everyone wants to
stick it to the man

Sorrento leads them off the platform and into the courtyard
below

EXT IOI HEADQUARTERS COURTYARD (OASIS)

The courtyard of IOI’s Oasis Headquarters is unimaginatively
similar to their real world campus though everything is
bigger and more ostentatious

SORRENTO
And I like a good treasure hunt as
much as the next person But could
you imagine if these so-called
“rebs” won the contest

They walk past a stunning gravity-defying fountain towards
the massive towers

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Theyd dismantle the place in
weeks

WADE
Is that what they say

SORRENTO
That’s what they’d do You take all
the commerce out of the Oasis it
falls apart Halliday always had a
business model he was no
communist

As they move toward the building’s giant glass doors
Parzival sees hundreds of nameless IOI WORKERS filing out a
side door towards their respective shitty jobs

PARZIVAL
This is where all your employees
spawn huh

SORRENTO
Yes but don’t worry they
immediately move off site The
executives -- which you would be --
don’t have to interact with the
worker bees

Sorrento points Z to the executive elevator

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Youll barely ever see them

Parzival notices his AUNT ALICE’S AVATAR among the crowd
Despite his mixed feelings about her it’s hard for him to
feel good about Sorrento’s comment

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS - SORRENTO’S OFFICE (OASIS)

Parzival and Sorrento step out into Sorrento’s opulent
office The windows off the observation deck afford a
stunning view of the surrounding virtual city

SORRENTO
IOI wants you Parzival To help
find Hallidays Easter egg

PARZIVAL
That’s what I figured

SORRENTO
Youd have everything at your
disposal youd be free to follow
any strategy

PARZIVAL
But if I win IOI would run the
Oasis

SORRENTO

Youd rather run it yourself
Parzival looks at Sorrento quizzically

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Do you know how hard it is to
maintain the Oasis Do you know how
many hours a day Halliday worked

PARZIVAL SORRENTO
Twenty hours a day Twenty hours that’s right

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Thats what it takes Is that the
kind of person you are

Parzival considers this He is definitely not a “20 hours a
day” kind of guy

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Our offer won’t require twenty
hours a day But it does come with
your own penthouse apartment in
Columbus with the highest speed
connection and the best deck money
can buy

This gets Parzival’s attention

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Youll have all of our companys
vast resources at your disposal
Money weapons magic items ships
artifacts You name it And I
haven’t even gotten to how well
this job pays

PARZIVAL
I don’t think I can be a sixer
it’s
SORRENTO
(interrupting)

Two million a year To start

PARZIVAL
Oh Shit

SORRENTO
Regardless of outcome And if and
when you help us find the egg
Youll get a twenty-five-million-
dollar bonus

Parzival says nothing

INT WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)

While in real life a hyperventilating Wade has to take his
visor off just to catch his breath

WADE
Holy crap

He slips it back on

INT SORRENTO’S OFFICE (OASIS)
Parzival looks pretty cool as he considers Sorrento’s offer

SORRENTO
Look Z I know you’re using
emotion-suppressing software right
now and why wouldn’t you It’s
smart not to give away your hand

In the background the planets simulated sun begins to set
casting a glow over the room It’s actually quite beautiful

SORRENTO (CONTD)
But one thing I can tell you is
that life is a lot easier when you
have money in the real world

Relationships are easier

Parzival isn’t sure what he’s getting at but it definitely
makes him think

PARZIVAL
When you say we One question

SORRENTO
(knows the question)
As our employee you’d be playing
on behalf of IOI

PARZIVAL
So IOI would own the Oasis

SORRENTO
We would own it Wade All of us
who work at IOI Well all of us
who own stock

PARZIVAL
But we keep Halliday’s rules Equal
access equal bandwidth

Sorrento tightens tries to smile This is a bit of a sore
subject

SORRENTO
Ah yes equal bandwidth Halliday’s
dream Do you know how much that
slows things down Wade It’s a
lovely idea but do you know how
much faster and better the Oasis
can be If we maximize the
bandwidth potential for income

ON PARZIVAL -- hearing those buzzwords maximize bandwidth
potential It strikes a chord

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Your 25 million will be worth fifty
million two months after IOI takes
over That’s a guarantee Fifty
million is that a good deal

PARZIVAL
I’m sorry no

Sorrento’s face falls

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Im probably going to really regret
this but I cant do it

SORRENTO
I’m sure you’ll regret it but I
understand I really do In fact
Id like to say something off the
record

Parzival shrugs “why not”

With a wave of his hand Sorrento disables all the cameras
and microphones in the room

SORRENTO (CONTD)
The truth is I had to make this
offer The Board insisted But I
was really hoping you would say no
Because if anyone wins it’s going
to be me My avatar will get that
egg because the truth is I am the
only one with the balls to run this
place right

PARZIVAL
Wow you kind of switched gears
there from “fairly reasonable” to
“maniacal overlord”

SORRENTO
Ha funny There’s the obnoxious
wit I’ve heard about Well
consider yourself lucky Wade
because you won’t be around to
experience my “maniacal” reign

Parzival reacts Did he just say “Wade” Sorrento gets a
wicked grin on his face

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Yes that’s right I know who you
are Wade Owen Watts Born August
twelfth 2024 Both parents
deceased I also know where you
are

A vidfeed window opens directly behind Sorrento displaying a
live aerial view of Wade’s Stacks

SORRENTO (CONTD)
You live with your aunt in the
Stacks 700 Portland Avenue in
Oklahoma City

(MORE)

SORRENTO (CONTD)
Unit 56-K to be exact You were
last seen entering her trailer
three days ago and you havent left
since Which means youre still
there right now and there’s no
time to get out

He puts a hand on Parzival’s shoulder
SORRENTO (CONTD)

I’m sorry Wade it really wasn’t

personal
Parzival suddenly blinks out Sorrento turns back to the
vidfeed monitor watching as IOI DRONES approach the Stacks
INT CARGO VAN -- THE REAL WORLD
But of course Wade isn’t IN the Stacks he’s in his hideout
He tears off his haptic gear and scrambles out of the van

EXT THE STACKS PERIMETER - NIGHT

Wade SPRINTS towards his stack trying to reach Alice on his
headset

WADE
Alice Alice You gotta get the
hell out of there--
OVERHEAD Wade can see more DRONES closing in on his stack
They look like they are carrying packages but as each of
them flies in--

They maneuver towards his stack and plant their packages on
the support struts of the unit

Red lights on their side blink faster and faster
Wade frantically calls out to his Aunt

WADE (CONTD)
Cmon Alice pick up

But Rick answers
RICK (0S)

Hey this bootsuit is pretty
awesome thanks for that

WADE
Rick get out of there The place
is gonna blow
Rick starts laughing
RICK (0S)
Hear that Alice This douchenozzle
is--
And that sadly is the last thing Rick ever says
KABOOM

The support columns are blown apart and the entire Stack
begins to teeter

The sound of RENDING METAL pierces Wade’s ears as the stack
RIPS FREE of its scaffolding and CRASHES against its
neighbor like a massive domino

Wade watches frozen in shock and horror as THREE STACKS
start falling

TOWARDS HIM
He runs as the massive towers split apart and fall
containers and RV homes flipping and tumbling and catching

fire as PROPANE TANKS EXPLODE

Wade just manages to get clear of the collapse As sirens
wail and people scream

For a moment Wade just stands there overcome by the horror
of it

Then he notices someone staring at him It’s that same GUY
the one with the LAME TATTOO

He’s moving towards him As Wade slowly backs away the guy
follows him

Now Wade starts to run

EXT STACKS

Wade is running as fast as he can but this isn’t the Oasis
his real body is out of shape He sucks air as he rounds one
of the Stacks and sees

AN IOI TRANSPORT pull up to the burning stacks and a dozen
IOI Security Guards hop out

Wade turns and runs in the other direction

Until Lame Tattoo rounds a corner just ahead of him Wade
slides almost falls down then turns and runs in the other
direction

AS THE STACKS BURN

Wade runs for his life through the wreckage trying to get
back to cover his Hideout He almost runs into another group
of IOI goons but they end up giving him the cover to escape
from Lame Tattoo

INT WADE’S HIDEOUT

Wade still clutching his backpack climbs into his van out
of breath

He sits there for a moment in shock then starts pounding on
the steering wheel Tears stream down his face

After a moment he catches his breath and tries to calm
himself down

EXT WADE’S HIDEOUT
Wade looks both ways before emerging from the hideout In
one direction the burning remains of the stacks in the

other the beckoning lights of Oklahoma City

He starts off in that direction when he is suddenly GRABBED
FROM BEHIND

It’s Lame Tattoo

Before he can scream he has a GAG in his mouth plastic
cuffs around his wrists Then a HOOD goes over his head

Everything goes black

EXT STACKS - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

Police and ambulances surround the disaster at the stacks An
IOI clean up CREW picks through the wreckage right alongside
the police

We hear chatter among onlookers and police about “an exploded
meth lab”

IN THE WRECKAGE -- One of the IOI guys pulls out the charred
remains of

A SHAPTIC BOOTSUIT As he lifts it up the ashes of an
incinerated body drop out of it

IOI GUY checks the serial number with a scanner On a small
display screen the details come up

“Purchaser WADE WATTS”

Satisfied IOI GUY nods to the others Their work here is
done

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY -- REAL WORLD

As the hood is pulled off the world is blurred and too
bright When WADE’S EYES finally adjust the first thing he
sees is

A KNIFE Wade raises his hands defensively but Lame Tattoo
just grabs them and

SLICES THE HANDCUFFS Then he pulls the gag out

Wade coughs spits His vision is starting to adjust He can
now see someone sitting just across from him A woman

She looks familiar dark hair and hazel eyes She has a
prominent BIRTHMARK on her left cheek which she hides with
her new wave hairdo but otherwise there’s no doubt who it
is

ARTEMIS
Hey Wade Welcome to the
rebellion

It’s the real life Artemis in the flesh

INT REB SAFE HOUSE

Wade and Artemis walk through the Reb Safe House It’s run
down but animated filled with other young people committed
to the cause

ARTEMIS
When I was a kid we moved around a
lot My Dad was always getting
hassled by the government or
corporations or whoever he just
couldn’t catch a break But he
fought for his rights even when it
got him in trouble

WADE
Wow Sounds rough

ARTEMIS
Well he went broke and then he
abandoned us But the point is he
taught me never to back down He
refused to give in to the systems
injustice So damn right I picked
up the torch

Everyone they pass nods to Artemis She’s a leader here

WADE
You’re even more badass in real
life

ARTEMIS
Nah

Artemis leads him past the Reb Oasis War Room where a bunch
of Rebs are logged in to haptic rigs

EXT REB SAFE HOUSE

Wade and Artemis step outside into a rundown neighborhood a
suburban slum In the distance he can see the gleaming
skyline of COLUMBUS OHIO

WADE
That’s Columbus huh

ARTEMIS
World’s nicest city If you’re rich
and powerful Otherwise you live
out here in the bandwidth slums

She motions to the rundown neighborhood around them

WADE
Never knew it was so bad

ARTEMIS
It isn’t just Columbus

Artemis points to the horizon where the Slums are expanding
Favela-like to cover the Ohio countryside

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
It’s everywhere IOI messes with
access speeds to force more and
more people into debt Case in
point

She points to an IOI SECURITY TEAM accompanied by the
POLICE dragging someone out of his home The guy has a
MOHAWK and wears an ironic “MATRIX KIDS” t-shirt His
screaming half-naked girlfriend holds a screaming totally-
naked baby

WADE
What the hell

ARTEMIS
That was LaJeremy our neighbor

LaJeremy is pushed into the back of an IOI transport van and
whisked away

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
You fall into enough debt IOI
takes you in for “loyalty service”
Have you ever seen a “loyalty
center” Wade

WADE
Only on a pamphlet

EXT IOI LOYALTY CENTER - COLUMBUS DIVISION (REAL WORLD)

An enormous building like the projects but there’s no
activity outside everyone is inside all the time

ARTEMIS
The key to the whole scam is
getting around Halliday’s first
rule one person one avatar

INT LOYALTY CENTER

The bullpen at the loyalty center is quite literally a SEA OF
a THOUSAND HAPTIC DECKS each with a poor soul in it under
servitude to IOI

ARTEMIS (0S)
Sorrento came up with the
workaround A way to spoof
accounts so he can take over for a
Sixer whenever he wants But it’s
worse than that

We watch some random guy working and working piling up coins
from his loyalty rig
The coins DRAIN OUT OF HIS ACCOUNT just as quickly

ARTEMIS (0S) (CONTD)
The “loyalists” don’t have an
identity in there Earnings just go
into a shared account IOI’s

EXT COLUMBUS SUBURBS

Artemis and Wade are walking back now

ARTEMIS
No matter how hard they work their
debt goes up IOI charges them for
their deck their access and room
and board The Oasis was built to
be free These Loyalty Centers will
turn everyone into slaves

WADE
Halliday never would have let this
happen

ARTEMIS
I know you love the guy Wade and
I had a lot of respect for him too
but Halliday knew there were
issues but he never did jack one
about it He wanted the whole world
to be a game and it just isn’t

Wade nods he’s experienced that first hand Suddenly the

events of the past few days come rushing back

Wade has to stop walking for a moment he feels dizzy

Wade sits

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
You okay

down on the sidewalk

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
Wade

WADE
They killed my Aunt She was a jerk
to me but she still raised me she
didn’t deserve to die None of them
did
(turning to her)
And you saved my life

Wade’s eyes are tearing up

WADE (CONT’D)
Aw man I must look pathetic

Artemis dries his tears she holds his face in her hands

ARTEMIS
Stop it You’ve been through hell
And you’re not pathetic you’re the
number one gunter in the world
That is bad ass

Wade and Artemis are incredibly close now his face just
inches from hers It feels like one of those moments

But they just sit there awkwardly Wade can’t make the move
The moment is gone

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
We should get back before the
patrols start

CUT TO

INT REB SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM

Artemis leads Wade into the Oasis War Room Wade pulls his
Aunt’s IOI gear out of his backpack

Artemis shakes her head

WADE
Oh Right IOI can trace it

She nods

ARTEMIS
Now youre getting the hang of it

Wade gets into one of the empty rigs Artemis watches as Wade
does some quick customization cleaning off the haptic

receivers with his shirt balling up the cord on his headset
so it doesn’t snag

Artemis is impressed when it comes to the Oasis Wade is a
pro She even imitates him pulling slack on her cords as
she gets in her rig

INT AECH’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Aech is in his basement studying a smaller version of the
Vendors Oasis Map

AECH
Enhance

Despite looking like a real map the image ZOOMS IN Aech

refers to a few different MARKED LOCATIONS where “The Leap”

might be

BECH (CONTD)
Gotta be the Brooklyn Bridge

PARZIVAL (0S)
Nope not the answer

Aech turns to see Parzival entering Artemis right behind
him

AECH
Z I was worried about you man

He and Z do their elaborate high-five move The one that
really is cool

Aech nods to Artemis somewhat less enthused The feeling
mutual

PARZIVAL
Are they here

AECH
(nods )
They’re here

SHOTO and DAITO step forward

PARZIVAL
Shoto Daito this is Artemis

Artemis takes a small bow

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Of all the gunters Shoto and Daito
are the two most skilled fighters
Ive ever seen Theyre maxed out
on all PVP categories

Shoto and Daito bow back to Artemis
PARZIVAL (CONTD)
You guys all got my message Aech

are you someplace safe

AECH
I’m on the run

is
Parzival turns to Shoto and Daito
PARZIVAL

Same for you two If you’re with

us they’1ll come looking for you

Parzival pauses then addresses the group

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
A good friend told me that we would
be better off working together I
didn’t listen to him

Aech is a bit embarrassed he knows it’s him

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
I thought Halliday wanted us to do
it alone but that’s only how he
would’ve done it I think he wanted
someone to be better than him

ARTEMIS
So we’re clanning up

PARZIVAL
Yes
(to Artemis)
But I’m not joining your clan

Artemis is confused Wade turns to Shoto

PARZIVAL (CONTD)

(to Shoto)
Not yours either

(to the group)
We are the Clan Right here in this
room this is the Oasis Dream Team
Were the “first five” and we are
going to win this thing together or
not at all

Murmurs of agreement from everyone except Artemis

ARTEMIS
Z you know it’s not that easy for
me I’m committed

PARZIVAL
Does your Clan know how to find the
second challenge

ARTEMIS
No of course not

SHOTO
Do you

Everyone turns to look at Z He smiles

PARZIVAL
Yes
(to Artemis)
Don’t want to put you on the spot
but if you’re with us you’re with
us

Artemis nods

ARTEMIS
Okay I’m in

AECH
So spill where’s the jump

PARZIVAL
There is no jump

AECH
Skeptical but intrigued

PARZIVAL
“Where lovers wouldn’t leap” It
hit me today It’s about a girl
(meeting Artemis’ eye)
And the leap he didn’t take

Artemis doesn’t seem to get Parzival’s meaning but Aech
does

PARZIVAL (0S) (CONTD)
After they blew the Flunkie Sprat
job Halliday and Morrow met to
work on a new idea It was a
seminal moment in history

INT GREGARIOUS GAMES -
Gregarious games headquarters circa 1998 Morrow sits at his
laptop Halliday paces

MORROW
I don’t think that’1ll track

HALLIDAY
Just try it Og

Morrow hits a button the machine renders SLOWLY

REVEAL --

That our assembled team is watching the scene together in the
Halliday Journals The Historian is there as well Parzival
monologues

PARZIVAL
I’ve watched the scene a million
times the night they sketched the
plans for the Oasis It took
sixteen years to make it work but
this is where it began

Bored Morrow leans back in his chair

MORROW
So how was it

HALLIDAY
I missed the voiceover I don’t
care what people say I like the
voiceover

MORROW
You know that’s not what I mean

Halliday frustrated paces quickly now

MORROW (CONTD)
What happened with her

HALLIDAY
She thought it was kind of dull
can you believe that

PARZIVAL
This is the same girl Halliday was
swooning over months before He
took her to a movie but he still
hadn’t taken the leap

Morrow shakes his head it’s like pulling teeth with him

MORROW
What does that have to do with
getting your mack on

HALLIDAY
It just bothers me it was a bomb
when it came out how can people
not recognize genius
MORROW
Ahead of its time Like us But
Jim did she

HALLIDAY

She invited me back to her place
MORROW

And
HALLIDAY

I don’t know Nothing happened

PARZIVAL
STOP

Parzival turns to Aech

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
See what I’m talking about
“Counting sheep” That’s what gives
it away

AECH
(catching his drift)
“Do Androids dream of electric
sheep” Right I mean you forget
because he says it was a bomb

ARTEMIS
(figuring it out)
Wait it was a bomb

PARZIVAL
Way ahead of its time The Citizen
Kane of dystopic future noir films

AECH
You think this is the clue to the
key

PARZIVAL
Definitely

The Historian clears his throat
HISTORIAN
I know I’m a computer program and I
should know this but what movie
are you talking about

They all look at him disappointed Then together

ALL
Blade Runner

EXT SPACE -- THE OASIS

The Vonnegut rockets across the Oasis Solar System once
again passing the enormous SCOREBOARD We hear Parzival’s
voice pre-lapped

PARZIVAL (0S)
Everyone knows Blade Runner has its
fingerprints all over the Oasis in
the architecture the vision of the
future even the avatars

The Vonnegut shoots towards a large planet with a number of
orbiting moons

EXT MOVIE THEATER ROW - NIGHT

A row of MOVIE THEATERS extends to the horizon each of them
playing one of Halliday’s favorite movies War Games Star
Wars Raiders Road Warrior Terminator Ferris Bueller Last
Action Hero all of the Monty Python movies

PARZIVAL
But if you know Halliday you know
that one of the first things he
built in the Oasis was a place for
his favorite movies

Our fabulous five come to a marquee with BLADE RUNNER
ORIGINAL EDITION on it

SHOTO
So what we’re gonna watch Blade
Runner

PARZIVAL

Something tells me there’1ll be more
to it than that

They pass through the doors of the movie theater and are
suddenly transported to

EXT LOS ANGELES 2019

HARRISON FORD as Deckard sits at his counter seat at the
noodle parlor People speak crazy polyglot languages It is --
literally -- Blade Runner

Parzival Aech Artemis Shoto and Daito suddenly appear in
the middle of the crowded street

SHOTO
Whoa We’re IN Blade Runner

AECH
It’s the immersive cut
(looking around)
Think it’s the Oculus Criterion
Edition

PARZIVAL
Yeah but this isn’t the beginning
of the movie

AECH
Were what eight minutes in

PARZIVAL
Nine forty I believe

Parzival notices a counter in the corner of the screen going
down from three hours

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
But that’s not what’s in our HUDs
Stay on your toes people this is
the challenge

ARTEMIS
I wonder what we’re supposed to do

SHOTO
Let’s just go ask Deckard

Shoto immediately heads over towards the noodle shop Daito
follows him

PARZIVAL
Hold on that might not be

But they’ve already gotten close enough

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
the best idea

SHOTO
Hey Deckard

Deckard looks up at Shoto for a moment then he pulls out his
gun and SHOOTS HIM The rest of them scatter

Daito takes a bullet to the back and dies too He and Shoto
are both dead in the challenge though they can still be
heard arguing in Japanese over voice chat

EXT LOS ANGELES 2019

Parzival Artemis and Aech hide in a side alley

ARTEMIS
Well now we know what the
challenge is

PARZIVAL
Do we

AECH
Were replicants the bad guys

PARZIVAL
They weren’t the bad guys they
were misunderstood They’re more
like the Na’vi in Avatar

AECH
Whatever dude split hairs

ARTEMIS
We expire in less than three hours
Not much time What should we do

PARZIVAL
Something in the clue “prove how
youre made” That’s the key To
the key Come on

He grabs Artemis’s hand and leads her away Aech reluctantly

follows

INT INTERVIEW OFFICE - TYRELL CORPORATION

Parzival Artemis and Aech walk through the office building
from the opening scene the one with the ceiling fans and
atmospheric smoke A wall suddenly appears between them
separating them

ARTEMIS
Hey

PARZIVAL
Remember what you

Too late the three of them will each be doing the challenge
on their own

INT OFFICE - NIGHT

Parzival slowly approaches a desk with a Voight-Kampff
machine sitting on it He knows which chair is his

To his surprise instead of Morgan Paull the original actor
ANORAK sits across from him He’s still got the cigarette and
the slicked back hair

ANORAK
You’re walking through a desert and
come upon a tortoise

Parzival smiles he knows this part

PARZIVAL
What’s a tortoise

ANORAK
You ever seen a turtle

PARZIVAL
Of course

ANORAK
Same thing You reach down and flip
it on its back

PARZIVAL
Do you make up these questions Mr
Halliday

ANORAK

Just answer the questions You’re

on a date

That throws Parzival definitely not from the movie

ANORAK (CONTD)

At the movies Your date invites

you to her place for a drink What

do you do

Parzival takes a long pause

PARZIVAL
I go with her

A long pause Then Anorak stands up and extends his hand

ANORAK
Alright You’re not a replicant
Anorak hands him a clipboard with the results to his test
PASSED -- HUMAN
ANORAK (CONTD)
(re clipboard)
Take this down to the next room
When Parzival looks down the clipboard is now
The JADE KEY
When he looks back up Anorak has disappeared And the office
door is a JADE DOOR He turns the key and walks through
EXT NEONOIR (OASIS)

Only to find Artemis waiting on the other side They are back
outside the movie theaters

PARZIVAL
What the

ARTEMIS
Guess I answered quicker

They look up to see the SCOREBOARD
ARTEMIS in the lead PARZIVAL in second
Aech steps through a moment later

AECH
Damn you guys beat me

AECH appears on the scoreboard too

INT SIXER DEPARTMENT (REAL WORLD)

Sorrento is looking at images of what little is left of the
Portland Avenue Stacks including Wade’s Bootsuit He talks
to NUMBER SIX on his HUD at the same time

NUMBER SIX
Im telling you whatever you did
to his account hes back online

SORRENTO
Not possible I deleted his
account Permanently

Clearly Six doesn’t know exactly how deep and dirty Sorrento
goes

NUMBER SIX
Well look at the scoreboard

Sorrento checks one of the display screens sure enough
there’s PARZIVAL second on the Scoreboard now behind
Artemis

SORRENTO
We have to go about this a
different way Get me her identity

NUMBER SIX
Gonna cost you extra

SORRENTO
I dont care just find out who she
is

Sorrento signs off

INT AECH’S BASEMENT (OASIS)

In the Oasis the First Five clan celebrates their victory
singing along to “We Are the Champions”

In a rousing moment Aech turns to Artemis He holds up his
hand for an old-fashioned high-five

AECH
Nice moves back there

ARTEMIS
(smiles )
You too

She clears her throat to get everyone’s attention

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
Okay ready for the third clue

They all clap and whistle She reads

ARTEMIS (CONT’D)
The first was ringed in red metal
The second in green stone

(MORE)

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
The third is clearest crystal
And cannot be unlocked alone

A beat as everyone mulls that over

AECH
What do you think some sort of key
trick

PARZIVAL

Doesn’t say anything about where
the challenge is

ARTEMIS
Maybe that’s the trick

AECH
Whatever we’ve got time to figure
it out right More music

Aech throws another track on “My Sharona” They all start
dancing again

INT REB SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

The Oasis War Room at the Reb Safe House Wade helps Artemis
out of her gear She’s humming MY SHARONA to herself

ARTEMIS
Never heard that song before its
awesome

Wade looks at her incredulous

ARTEMIS (CONTD)

(shrugs)
I got into the 80’s stuff cause of
the contest not the other way
around So I guess Ive got gaps in
my knowledge The other day some
guy said he was gonna pull a “Lloyd
Dobler” on me I had no idea
whether to thank him or punch him

WADE
Say Anything

ARTEMIS
Excuse me

WADE
Hold on

Wade speaks a muffled voice command into his rig then holds
up his headphones The sound is really good as a SONG COMES
UP

ARTEMIS
What is it

WADE
A great song from Halliday’s twenty-
seventh favorite movie

MUSIC CUE “IN YOUR EYES” BY PETER GABRIEL They sit
together for a moment just listening to the song

WADE (CONTD)
What do you think

Cynical dicks can turn the page now but the song has its
magic and it WORKS Artemis smiles clearly into it

ARTEMIS
How do you know all this stuff
anyway

WADE

My Mom and Dad that’s what they
grew up on It was all Atari and
comic books and Halliday I didn’t
get much time with them they died
when I was a kid but I did inherit
their tastes

Artemis slides closer so she can hear better Their legs
press against each other Wade naturally rests his hand on
her shoulder

ARTEMIS
You ever wonder why Halliday did
all this The contest I mean

WADE
I think he was cut off y’know He
wanted to be understood but he
didn’t know how to talk to people
So this was a way to get them to
understand

Artemis nods makes sense They just listen to the song for a
moment

ARTEMIS
So what’s a “Lloyd Dobler”

Wade turns a bit red then smiles

WADE
Well it’s when a guy plays a
great song for a girl he’s really
into to get her to go out with
him

ARTEMIS
Oh

She has her hand on his now

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
You know that thing you said about
not taking a leap

WADE
(already leaning in)
Yeah

Before she can finish her thought Wade completes it by
kissing her He’s surprised that he made the move She’s
surprised how badly she wants to kiss him back

And it’s not just a peck not an accident not just of the
moment It’s a long slow kiss and the song keeps playing

INT REB SAFE HOUSE - WADE’S ROOM (REAL WORLD)

- aS Wade and Artemis connect on a more physical level
And by that I mean sex They have sex with each other Or
however much people feel comfortable with these days which
is probably more prudish than it should be but whatever

When it’s over they fall asleep holding hands

Music takes us through a TIME CUT When the music ends a
sleeping Wade opens his eyes Artemis is getting dressed
From the moonlight coming in through the window it’s clearly
the middle of the night

WADE
Hey Where you going

ARTEMIS
Wade

WADE
Sorry if I pulled a “Dobler” on
you

Artemis can’t help but smile
ARTEMIS

This was great I just
WADE

I get it
ARTEMIS

No I mean I can’t do this again
I cant be with you

Wade’s smile fades

WADE
Why
ARTEMIS
I we both need to be focused on

the contest

WADE
One doesn’t mean the other

ARTEMIS
No it does

Artemis is hurrying to pull her boots on Wade sits up

WADE
Hey Artemis Can you listen to me
for one second

She turns and looks at him

WADE (CONTD)
These clues the ones Halliday is
leaving They’re all saying the
same thing

ARTEMIS
Wade
WADE
He met someone and he
(a beat)

he loved her And he let it
slip away

ARTEMIS
Wade you’re embarrassing me

WADE
I know and I’m embarrassing me
too But I know what I want I know
you feel something I can feel it

Artemis looks at Wade very confused

ARTEMIS
I’m sorry I just can’t

She hurries out of the room leaving a distraught Wade
behind

WADE (0S)
Remember you said if I ever needed
help in the real world

CUT TO

EXT REB SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

Reveal Wade slipping out one of the windows of the Reb
house backpack over his shoulder whispering to Aech over a
headset

BECH (0S)
Course Just say it

Wade lands on the ground He heads towards the lights in the
distance

WADE
Well how far away are you from
Columbus

A pause from the other end

WADE (CONT’D)
Aech You there

AECH
Yeah I’m here Not that far maybe
two hours I’1ll come get you

WADE
Thanks dude you are a true
friend

AECH

I know Just don’t forget that
okay When you meet me

Aech hangs up leaving Wade wondering what he meant

EXT REB SAFE HOUSE (REAL WORLD)

TWO DRONES have gathered above the Reb Safe House their red
lights pulsing softly A third and a fourth join them
Something is going down

EXT FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)

Wade lingers outside of a fully automated fast food place
BURGER CHICKEN-CORN PIZZARITO There are no workers or cooks
just machines that inject processed protein glop into pre-
rolled deep fried burrito shells

Then AN RV PULLS UP A mocha colored SunRider at least two
decades old A patchwork of solar cells cover the RVs roof

along with a liberal amount of rust The windows are tinted

black

The side door opens revealing a short ASIAN KID who’s way
too young to drive He beckons Wade over

WADE
Shoto You’re a kid

Shoto laughs

WADE (CONTD)
When did you get here

SHOTO
We flew in yesterday Aech picked
us up Join the party
INT AECHS RV - CONTINUOUS (REAL WORLD)

Wade climbs in sees an older Asian male sitting in the back

WADE
And you must be Daito

DAITO just nods he doesn’t speak English Then from the
drivers seat a voice Wade doesn’t recognize

BECH (0S)
Hi Wade

Wade turns to see a heavyset African American girl about
Wades age with short kinky hair

WADE
Hi Where’s Aech

AECH
I’m Helen My Dad called me “Aech”
and it stuck

Wade is shocked

WADE
Wait Aech You

AECH

Ugh I knew you’d be mad Grab a
seat

Wade barely has time to sit down before Aech peels out

EXT COLUMBUS (REAL WORLD)

As dawn breaks the RV rolls into Columbus the most
spectacular city in the world Paris on the Scioto River

INT VAN --

Wade now sits in the passenger seat The tension is palpable

AECH
So what is it that I’m a girl Or
Black Maybe I’m heavy is that it

WADE
Of course not It’s just all
those times we talked about
girls

AECH
Oh yeah Well I’m a lesbian

WADE
Really

Aech laughs Now that she’s smiling he recognizes her

WADE (CONTD)
Damn I had no idea

SHOTO
You didn’t know Dude your gaydar
is broken

Aech looks over at Wade

AECH
I’m sorry I wasn’t honest with you

WADE
It doesn’t matter I didn’t tell
you I was even better looking in
the real world
(looking around the RV)
I like your set up here

AECH
We keep it moving Stay one step
ahead We’re rigged up for five if
we need it

She taps what looks like a radar detector on her dash

BECH (CONTD)
Got my 40G wifi hotspot fully

encrypted
WADE
Cool
AECH
What happened with Artemis
WADE
She hasn’t realized that she loves
me yet
AECH
But you love her
WADE
Doesn’t matter We have a key to
find
AECH

That’s the spirit

CUT TO

INT REB SAFE HOUSE - DAWN (REAL WORLD)

Artemis walks up to the second floor looking like she didn’t
get a good night’s sleep She knocks on Wade’s door

ARTEMIS
Wade

No response She opens the door His stuff is gone And so is
he

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
(tearing up)
Damn it Wade I liked you

Then she sees something strange out the window shadows
moving over the front lawn Pulling herself together she
goes downstairs to check it out

EXT REB SAFE HOUSE - DAWN

Artemis steps outside studying the strange shadow patterns
on the ground She looks up and sees a weird formation

overhead She squints realizing too late what it is

THE SKY IS FILLED WITH DRONES HUNDREDS OF THEM like BATS
CIRCLING OVERHEAD

THEN -- BLINDING LIGHTS

A HELICOPTER FLIES IN BLACK SUITED SECURITY GUYS rush the
house Artemis tries to run but is tackled by IOI SECURITY
THEN TEN MORE SECURITY GUYS rush into the house gunfire and
explosions break the night’s silence

Its an all-out assault

CUT TO

INT AECH’S RV - DAY (THE REAL WORLD)

Aech drives while Daito and Shoto are logged in to the Oasis
keeping up the hunt It’s Wade’s turn to sleep but he keeps
tossing and turning something on his mind

Finally he bolts upright
WADE
I just figured it out The crystal
door
Wade climbs up to the front seat
WADE (CONTD)

In Anoraks Castle theres a
crystal door

AECH
Dude theres a thousand Anoraks
Castles

WADE

But I think I know which one

Aech pulls the RV over

EXT ANORAK’S CASTLE -- PLANET DOOM (OASIS)

The Vonnegut emerges in orbit on the dark side of PLANET
DOOM Daito yells in Japanese Shoto points out the window

SHOTO
Look

Nolan Sorrento has just jumped ahead on the scoreboard

AECH
Sorrento’s got the second key

PARZIVAL
And I think they’ve beat us to the
third challenge

Even miles away from Anorak’s Castle they can see AN
ENORMOUS DOME-LIKE FORCE FIELD surrounding it

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
No you gotta be kidding me

The group deflates

PARZIVAL (CONT’D)
Screw them

AECH
Excuse me

PARZIVAL
Screw them They can’t stop us that
easy I’ve got an idea

INT AECHS RV - MOVING (REAL WORLD)

Daito is now in the driver’s seat Shoto in the passenger
seat translating into Japanese

WADE
(zipping up his haptic
suit)
Tell him to drive in the middle
lane safely and slowly

Shoto translates Daito nods Aech gets in her haptic rig

They log in READY PLAYER ONE

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS

Sorrento in his office in the Oasis receives an update
through a vidfeed window in his HUD Number Six stands in
front of ANORAK’S CASTLE INSIDE the force field

NUMBER SIX
The intel you got from the raid was
good the challenge is in there
It’s not easy But the perimeter’s
secure we’ve got time to figure it
out

SORRENTO
I’m on my way Don’t do anything
until I get there I want to be the
one to walk through the gate

NUMBER SIX
Yeah I figured

Sorrento closes the vidfeed window and exits

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS

Sorrento leaves his office heading for the executive
transport platform in the IOI courtyard As he walks past the
gravity-defying fountain someone steps in his way

It’s a bad-ass looking Samurai Despite a face mask we
recognize him as SHOTO Sorrento tries to step around him
but Shoto blocks him
SORRENTO
Get the hell out of my way Do you
know who I am
SHOTO
Nolan Sorrento I send greetings
from Wade Watts and the First Five

SORRENTO
Are you serious Security

Before Sorrento can get the word out SHOTO ZAPS SORRENTO
WITH a CATTLE PROD His avatar crumbles to the ground

INT SORRENTO’S HOME -- THE REAL WORLD

Nolan Sorrento’s eyes suddenly jolt open That actually hurt

He looks around

He’s in his Haptic Hamster Ball in the same room we saw
during the virtual tour of his home He breathes a sigh of
relief the Oasis is so real sometimes

Relieved he pulls off his visor then hits a button which
rotates him until he is standing The hamster ball separates
revealing

WADE WATTS in the flesh standing right in front of him

WADE
Hello Nolan

Wade is pointing a gun at him Sorrento goes pale

SORRENTO
No it’s not possible

Sorrento climbs out catching a glimpse of his own reflection
in the polished walls of the rig It’s real world Sorrento
all right

SORRENTO (CONTD)
How did you get into my home

WADE
Without killing anyone So far

SHOTO steps out dressed in civilian clothes but holding a
SWORD and a TASER Despite his age the look in his eye is
deadly

WADE (CONT’D)
If you want to keep it that way
youre gonna tell us everything you
know about the third challenge and
how to pull down that force field

Off Sorrento terrified

CUT TO

INT SORRENTO’S HOME - LATER

The door to Sorrento’s Haptic Rig Room opens up and Wade
emerges

WADE
(back into the room)
Shoto if his info is bad start
taking fingers

We can hear Sorrento’s protests as Wade shuts the door behind
him He walks away from the room and now we reveal

That this “room” is actually a virtual set inside of AECH’S
OASIS WORKSHOP Wade walks over to AECH who sits ata
control board which has fifteen camera views of the action

WADE (CONTD)
He totally bought it

Wade hands Aech a DATA PACKET (remember they are in the
Oasis) and specs for the IOI force field come up in his HUD

AECH
Course he did He’s in full haptic
feedback he can’t tell where he
is

WADE
You hear back from Arty

Aech shakes his head “no” Wade nods

WADE (CONTD)
Great job on the skins by the way

AECH
Yeah missed a spot or two

Aech points on one of the monitors THE BACK OF SORRENTO’S
HEAD is unfinished

WADE
Can’t look at the back of your own
head right I wouldn’t worry about
it

Suddenly there’s an earthquake-like JOLT

INT AECHS RV - DRIVING -- THE REAL WORLD

DAITO driving as carefully as he can has just driven over a
huge pothole but only because he’s trying to lose

THREE IOI DRONES
It’s not clear if they are simply sweeping over or actually
tailing them but Daito is taking no chances He swerves

again

WADE (0S)
What the hell

INT CONTROL ROOM -- OASIS
WADE speaks through his HUD to DAITO

WADE
Slow and steady D

Daito lets out a stream of Japanese the only recognizable
words are “IOI Drones”

AECH
Semi-bad news

Wade turns back to Aech who has finished analyzing the IOI
force field

BECH (CONTD)
The Force Field is from a spell in
Gauntlet 2027 Magic and Physics
proof We can un-cast it but only
if we’re in close proximity

WADE
So we go to the castle and un-cast

AECH
Yeah but we better hustle

Aech refers to another monitor a live feed from a gunter
clan

OUTSIDE IOI HQ -- the SIXER ARMY is preparing for transport
to Planet Doom THOUSANDS OF THEM

WADE
Okay let’s wrap this up

They turn back to the feed of Sorrento To their surprise
Shoto not only has his sword to his throat he is angrily
interrogating him

SHOTO
If you’re lying I cut off your
hands

SORRENTO

I’m not don’t They didn’t kill
her she’s still alive

Wade suddenly looks up

WADE
What did he say

SORRENTO
The girl Artemis We didn’t kill
her in the raid We have her

Wade and Aech exchange a look

INT SORRENTO’S FAKE DECK
Wade storms into the room and grabs Sorrento by the collar

WADE
Where is she

SORRENTO
IOI with the other Sixers She’s
fine a little bruised but
WADE goes for Sorrento and Shoto has to hold him back
SHOTO
(under his breath)
Chill Wade You’1ll wake him up
Wade turns away from Sorrento whispers to Aech
WADE
Tell Daito to head for IOI HQ in
the RW Now

AECH (0S)

On it
EXT AECH’S RV - DRIVING
But DAITO has his own issues More DRONES close in overhead
Daito has to drive into a tunnel to evade them An IOI drone
EXPLODES as it hits the tunnel strut But as the van passes
into the tunnel the SIGNAL weakens
INT SORRENTO’S FAKE RIG ROOM

The loss of the signal causes the room to PIXELATE just for
a moment Sorrento catches it

SORRENTO
What was that

Sorrento looks at his reflection again and this time notices
something strange about the back of his head He tries to
contort himself so he can see it but it’s not easy

Another BUMP another GLITCH
Sorrento’s eyes narrow He knows what’s going on

SORRENTO (CONTD)
You slimy little bastard Guess
what I am gonna hurt your little
girlfriend

Suddenly Sorrento starts pulling at wires that don’t seem to
be there and he DISAPPEARS

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The real Sorrento wakes up in his actual home in his real
rig his high-impact haptic skull piece no longer attached
He carefully opens his hamster ball

There’s no one there

Furious Sorrento scrambles out of his unit for real

INT AECHS RV - DAY

Aech drives as fast as she can in the direction of IOI
headquarters which is visible not that far away

WADE
Go faster

AECH
Going as fast as I can This isn’t
my spinner

It’s true compared to the Oasis driving in the real world
is painfully slow

AECH (CONTD)
Can I just make a point here

WADE
No

AECH
The Sixers are at the castle on
Doom but they won’t take the key
without Sorrento So we have a
short window to get out there

Wade shakes his head

WADE
I’m going after Artemis

AECH
But Wade think this through

WADE
I love her Aech

Aech sighs she understands

AECH
I get it but breaking into IOI in
the Oasis isn’t the same as doing
it in real life oh crap

Suddenly Aech swerves

EXT STREETS OF COLUMBUS

Aech’s RV has been cut off by a TESLA LIMO-BUS the kind kids
in the future take to prom

Aech immediately throws the van in reverse

BUT A SECOND TESLA an electricity-guzzling SEDAN has them
blocked off

AECH
Dude We’re f-ed

WADE
We gotta run for it

Before they can go for the door a FIGURE steps out into the
street calls to them

FIGURE (0S)
Aech Don’t be a moron Get out of
your car

Wade looks at Aech

WADE
Who is that

AECH
It’s not Sorrento

FIGURE (0S)

All of you stop juggling your nads
and get out here time is ticking
ticking into the future

EXT LIMO VAN

They four of them tentatively exit the van and walk towards
the figure slowly

FIGURE
Can you please walk faster Before
all the bad things happen

AECH
Ven

The voice is the same but it doesn’t look like David Cross
And yet that is unmistakably the inflections of the Vendor
who is now revealed to be

OGDEN MORROW

INT LIMO VAN

Ogden leads them into the back of the giant Tesla party-
mobile

MORROW
(to the driver)
Take us to the back entrance of
Tol

The driver pulls out as Morrow rummages through a bag of
stuff

MORROW (CONTD)
I’m impressed with you guys
Particularly you Wade you really
picked up on Halliday’s message
very quickly

WADE
One thing I still don’t understand
who was the girl and why Bethesda
fountain

Morrow smiles wistfully

MORROW
Her name was Kira And she was my
wife And Bethesda Fountain that
was the last place I ever saw
Halliday

off the four still not understanding

EXT BETHESDA FOUNTAIN - FLASHBACK

Halliday and Morrow argue in the real Central Park circa

MORROW
You have to let it go Jim Do you
understand how insane this is

HALLIDAY
I don’t have to do anything You
stole her from me

MORROW
Stole Kira and I are getting
married You went on one date with
her fifteen years ago
Halliday is clearly not thinking straight
HALLIDAY
She was the one The only one And
you betrayed me You’re OUT
Morrow has tears in his eyes Halliday walks away leaving
stunned Morrow alone at the fountain

INT LIMO VAN - BACK TO PRESENT

Morrow is emotional recalling the moment

MORROW
After Kira died -- and then he got
sick too -- he sent me a letter

Very unlike him It only had two
words on the page “I’m sorry”

AECH
(tearing up)
Damn Now I’m getting emotional

MORROW
This contest is his confessional
He wants someone to fix the
mistakes he made Or simply not
make them again

The Limo Van comes to a halt

MORROW (CONTD)
As a major shareholder I’m not
supposed to interfere but that
luckbox kidnapped your lady and
that is not cool Here

He hands Wade and Aech ID CARDS For IOI

AECH
How’d you get these
MORROW
I’m super super obscenely rich I
can get anything I want
(then)
Now go Save your girl And the
Oasis

The four of them jump out of the car

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
Sorrento in his own car is moments away from IOI HQ
SORRENTO

the girl I’m going in
EXTINT IOI HEADQUARTERS — DAY

Wade and Aech use their ID CARDS to enter IOI HQ They act
casual careful not to raise suspicion from IOI security

WADE
I’1ll head up to the Sixer floor
You hit the computers

AECH
Got it

They split off

EXT IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)

Sorrento pulls into the executive lot He literally throws
his keys at the valet parking guy

EXT PLANET DOOM (OASIS)

Artemis is on a VIRTUAL CHAIN GANG helping to fortify IOI
defenses around Castle Anorak She drags her feet a
Supervisor glares at her but then suddenly she sees the LOG
OUT SCREEN

INT SIXER BULLPEN

Artemis emerges from the Oasis to see WADE standing over her
rig

ARTEMIS
Wade Oh my God Wade you came for
me

She embraces him then he KISSES HER

WADE
Come on we need to move

He pulls her out of the rig

EXT IOI COURTYARD -- REAL WORLD

Wade leads Artemis by the hand across the courtyard

ARTEMIS

Wait the exit is over here
WADE

We’re not leaving we’re logging

in
Artemis looks at him surprised

WADE (CONTD)
No one’s beaten the third challenge
yet You were the one who convinced
me This needs to be done

ARTEMIS
Well then we’re doing it together
But where

WADE
The one place they won’t think to
look and where they won’t find us
if they do

Wade leads her to the adjacent IOI LOYALTY CENTER

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)

Sorrento enters the Sixer department only to see one of his
befuddled functionaries standing next to the rig Artemis was
just in

SORRENTO
No You’re kidding me

SIXER
She was in here

SORRENTO
I thought you had her tethered

SIXER
We did sir

SORRENTO
Well find her DAMN YOU FIND HER

The Sixer runs off frightened

INT LOYALTY CENTER

Wade and Artemis run through the rows of hundreds of haptic
decks looking for one in particular

WADE
(into comms)
Talk to me Aech

AECH (0S)
It’s in the seventh row exactly
eleven units from the end

With Aech’s directions Wade quickly locates the rig They
swing it open revealing

ARTEMIS
LaJeremy

It’s LaJeremy Artemis’s NEIGHBOR WITH THE MOHAWK Wade
undoes his restraints

WADE
Your debt is officially paid off

LAJEREMY
Thank you Artemis You too dude

He bolts out of there Artemis gets in Wade climbs in to the
next deck

WADE
First to the key

ARTEMIS
First to the egg

INT SIXER DEPARTMENT -- THE REAL WORLD

Sorrento paces up and down the rows of the Sixer department
urging his troops on

SORRENTO
Come on people first one to get
to the final screen gets a bonus
I’m counting on you

A SIXER approaches

SIXER
Sir we have reason to believe
Artemis is still on the premises

SORRENTO
Where

SIXER
I don’t know but she’s in the
Oasis right now

INT THE VONNEGUT -- THE OASIS

Indeed she is in the Oasis flying the Vonnegut to Planet
Doom while Parzival streams out a message

PARZIVAL
Fellow Gunters today the assclowns
at IOI found the third challenge
and they put a FORCE FIELD around
it They think we are too busy
fighting each other to notice
Nolan Sorrento thinks the gamers in
the Oasis will never pull it
together

Parzival pauses for dramatic effect

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Well I say tell that to the gunter
clans in the gold mines of Ludus
(MORE)

PARZIVAL (CONTD)
Tell it to the anons and the
channers the newbs in the Reddit
Army and the 98th level ninja magic
users

As Parzival speaks we see his message broadcast

EXT INCIPIO -- THE OASIS

On every billboard on every blimp on every screen in every
heads up display all over Incipio Avatars stop what
they’re doing to watch Parzival’s message on their live
stream

PARZIVAL
Tell it to themed Gunter clans the
Dothraki Klingon Alliance the
Trekkies the 8 Bit Warriors from
the Atari system the stat-heads
from the Fantasy Sports guild

EXT THE REAL WORLD (VARIOUS)

Now we focus on individuals in the real world a portly kid
sweating it out in his cheap haptic rig a cute cheerleader
type in a glossy pink immersion unit a LAN party of 12-year-
old pimple-faced geeks in the stacks of Memphis

EXT PLANET DOOM - APPOMATTOX (OASIS)

On the hills of a civil war reenactment Union and
Confederate soldiers stand side by side looking up at the
message in the sky

PARZIVAL

the name of Artemis and Aech and
Daito and Shoto we call on all
gunters

EXT TIMES SQUARE (OASIS)

Avatars watch Parzival making his declaration on the
jumbotron in Times Square

PARZIVAL
Join us in glory Meet us on the
dark side of Planet Doom In the
name of Halliday himself fight for
the future of the Oasis

A BATTLE CRY rises up from a million souls SHIPS launch into
ORBIT Transport platforms are overrun

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS

Sorrento watches from the Sixer division growing
increasingly frustrated as none of his Sixers have gotten
close to the final key

He gets a message from Number Six

NUMBER SIX (0S)
Hey Sorrento looks like we’ve got
company

EXT CASTLE ANORAK

Number Six stands outside the Castle Sorrento appears in a
vidfeed window watching with him They peer into the
distance

PARZIVAL stands atop the highest point of Anoraks Fence
holding a BOOMBOX above his head We hear the first few
strains of high-pitched guitar

PARZIVAL
First to the key first to the egg

And now the fiery earwig of death that is BLACKENED by
Metallica thunders out into the air And an ARMY OF GUNTERS
rushes past Parzival and down towards the castle all of them
chanting

GUNTERS
First to the key first to the egg

A SQUADRON OF FLYING VEHICLES scream across the sky

ON THE HILLTOP --

Artemis swerves up in the DeLorean Parzival jumps in and
off they go

EXT CASTLE ANORAK

Number Six notices that Sorrento has disappeared from his
HUD He turns to look back at the Horde

NUMBER SIX
Theyll never get through the force
field

EXT CASTLE ANORAK

The Vonnegut Shoto at the helm flies over the top of the
Castle DAITO leaps out from the belly of the ship and falls
towards the force field Just as he’s about to hit he utters
the magic incantation of undoing

DAITO
RayKassarRassakYar

- and the spell is un-cast

EXT CASTLE ANORAK -- OASIS

Sorrento zaps in on the transport platform and walks over to
Number Six just as the FORCE FIELD SUDDENLY VANISHES

NUMBER SIX
What the hell

Sorrento armoring up yells an order to his troops

SORRENTO
Sixer Army do not let them through
the castle walls Attack

The Sixer Army races out to meet the enemy

EXT VALLEY OF DOOM

An overhead shot of the two massive armies racing towards
each other

WADE (VO)
Geeks the world over would sing
songs of that day The day the
citizens of the Oasis rose up with
a mighty fist and collectively
rammed it up IOI’s hairy sphincter
To the metaphorical elbow

Within the GUNTER HORDE we find the DELOREAN weaving past
all manner of avatar and vehicle

EXT VALLEY OF DOOM

The DeLorean bounces across the rocky field plowing through

and around Sixers and their allies Parzival opens his gull
wing door and leans out steering with one hand

PARZIVAL
Sniper rifle

A SNIPER RIFLE suddenly appears in his hand

WADE (VO)
They say I drove and sniped at the
same time I dont know that its
ever been done before maybe I had
auto-aim on but I know that bodies
fell by my hand

The armies grow closer and closer Parzival pops off a shot
that blows up a Sixer jeep

WADE (VO)

The sweat of a hundred thousand

nerds poured forth that day

It was violent and aggressive and

slightly NSFW
And now the armies MEET It’s an insane fight every kind of
Avatar one can imagine as if Peter Jackson staged a battle
with cosplayers from Comicon

WADE (VO)
They sent trolls

Huge TROLLS stomp across the battlefield one of them about
to STOMP on the DeLorean

WADE (VO)
And we countered with Giants

- until an enormous robotic hand reaches down grabs the
troll and FLINGS IT ACROSS THE VALLEY

It’s the IRON GIANT driven by Aech

INT IRON GIANT
Aech is steering the Iron Giant from his customized cockpit
AECH
Eat giant metal bitches
INT DELOREAN

Artemis takes over behind the wheel as Parzival fires off
more sniper shots He runs out of ammo and tosses the gun

PARZIVAL
More weapons

ARTEMIS
Staff of piercing

Artemis tosses him a DATA PACKET that becomes a long SPEAR in
his hand

PARZIVAL
Staff of piercing

He throws it skewering eleven Sixers at once

ARTEMIS
Nuchakus of destiny

They appear in Parzival’s hand and he smacks a disgusting ORC
with them literally knocking it into next week

ARTEMIS (CONTD)
Bow of ending

Parzival fires a destructive arrow and now OTHER GUNTERS get
into the action offering their own inventory to Parzival He
repeats the names of each as he uses them

PARZIVAL
Anti-personnel ordinance cannon
Rail Gun Axe gun

A gun that fires AXES Silly but effective

GUNTER
Velociraptor

Parzival throws a full grown dinosaur at a group of Sixers

GUNTER 2
Grenade disguised as a kitten

Parzival a bit surprised looks down at the cute kitten now
in his hand He shrugs and throws it

IN THE FIELD -- A group of sixers look down at the cute
widdle kitty she purrs and then EXPLODES incinerating
them

PARZIVAL
(solemnly)
Musket of Infinite Velocity

A MUSKET courtesy of Aech appears in Parzival’s hand He
fires it and A MUSKET BALL smashes through a SIXER then
continues and LITERALLY CIRCLES THE PLANET before smashing
into the next sixer and the next one

WADE (VO)
Sixer blood ran safe-for-teen green
in the rivers of Planet Doom in
the shadow of Anorak’s lair

EXT CASTLE ANORAK
Sorrento starting to get nervous sees that the tide is

turning He pages through his HUD looking for the right
weapon

EXT ANORAK’S CASTLE

Shoto and Daito are at the front lines expertly cutting down
trolls and IOI soldiers with their samurai swords trying to
clear the one bridge into the castle when

They come face to face with a SAURONSMAUGVOLDEMORT mash up
Forty feet tall one huge EYE staring down at them
menacingly

Shoto and Daito brandish their swords and face off with the
creature realizing it’s SORRENTO

Sorrento makes short work of Daito though Shoto manages to
hack off one of his hands

Then AECH steps in as the IRON GIANT He SQUASHES SORRENTO

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
Sorrento infuriated finds himself logged out of his rig He
rushes to get out of the rig and take another Sixer’s spot
when he is approached by IOI Security
IOI SECURITY
Sir weve found them They’re in
the loyalty center

Sorrento follows the guards

EXT ANORAK’S CASTLE

Artemis driving now steers away from the main gate where
the battle is still being pitched

PARZIVAL
All the other bridges are
destroyed we need to go through
the main gate

ARTEMIS
Too many obstacles

She heads for one of the shattered side bridges It has
collapsed into the water but part of it sticks up almost
like A RAMP

PARZIVAL
Could just be a glitch

ARTEMIS
C’mon Z what have we learned
There are no glitches Halliday put
it there for a reason

The DeLorean roars up the collapsed bridge hits the ramped
part and TAKES OFF

Jumping the moat the same way Artemis once jumped the cement
truck and landing right in front of the castle crushing
some Sixers in the process

Artemis and Parzival prepare to enter the Castle when
suddenly

THE IRON GIANT reaches down and deposits Aech next to them
A moment later Shoto and Daito drop in

The five of them enter the Castle

INT ANORAK’S CASTLE

As our team wanders down a cobblestone corridor they can
hear a SIXER struggling with the challenge

SIXER (0S)
No NO

Tentatively the Five step inside the Castle’s cavernous Great
Hall to find

The final challenge is deceivingly simple It’s a stand up
arcade cabinet of DONKEY KONG

The stressed-out Sixer makes a mistake

SIXER (CONTD)
Crap These effing barrels

And POOF he disappears Clearly you get one shot at the
challenge then you have to start over another day
Parzival turns to look at the troops
PARZIVAL
Everyone ready for some Donkey

Kong

NUMBER SIX (0S)
Not so fast

They turn to see NUMBER SIX waiting for them holding a
briefcase

PARZIVAL
Who are you
NUMBER SIX
Name’s Number Six
AECH
What’cha got there paperwork
NUMBER SIX
Briefcase nuke Sorry bucko but a
job’s a job

Number Six hits a button on the handle
BOOM
A sound like the entire universe cracking in half

WADE (VO)
When your avatar gets killed your
point of view shifts into third-
person giving you an out-of-body
replay of your final moment

WADE’S POV -- An INCINERATING WHITE LIGHT fills the world
accompanied by an earsplitting wall of sound

A blast disintegrates everything all the Gunters and Sixers
outside all the dragons and robots and bunnies Even the
First Five are incinerated to a fine atomized dust
suspended in the air for a moment before slowly settling to
earth

WADE (VO)
I waited for the inevitable final
message to appear in my display
the words I knew every other avatar
in the sector must be seeing at
this very moment

ANORAK’S CASTLE remains standing and the Donkey Kong arcade
cabinet is still there Otherwise the place is empty

WADE (VO)
GAME OVER

But instead a different message appears
Congratulations You have an extra life

Parzival’s avatar reappears fading back into existence right
where hed died a few seconds earlier

WADE (VO)
In the history of the OASIS there
was no record of any avatar ever
acquiring an extra life

He looks down to see that everything hed been carrying is
gone and his avatar now wears a black T-shirt and blue
jeans the default outfit on every newly created avatar

PARZIVAL
Hello Can anyone hear me

Silence He reaches in his pocket pulls out

THE QUARTER Only now do we realize that it is made of the
same high-definition material as the keys it is a special
gleaming quarter

WADE (VO)
Morrow had given me the most
powerful weapon in all of the
Oasis

Parzival walks up to the Donkey Kong cabinet He drops the
quarter in

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS (THE REAL WORLD)

Sorrento and his Security team race into the Loyalty Center
bullpen Sorrento taps a screen bringing up a GUIDE to who’s
in which rig

ON THE SCREEN -- Every rig has the same name NOLAN SORRENTO

SORRENTO
Let’s go rig by rig start
checking

The team spreads out through the room opening one rig after
another searching for Wade and Artemis

INT ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)
Parzival calmly progresses through a game of Donkey Kong

WADE (VO)
I could tell you it was the most
epic game of Donkey Kong I’d ever
played

We time lapse Parzival playing a really long game of Donkey
Kong INTERCUT with Sorrento and his men opening rig after
rig

WADE (VO)
But it was actually easier than I
expected Halliday’s score wasn’t
that great

Parzival finishes a level his score overtakes Halliday’s
Donkey Kong FALLS off the scaffold and in the process lets
go of what he was holding No not the Princess

THE CRYSTAL KEY

It leaps off the screen and appears in front of Parzival He
snatches it out of the air

INT LOYALTY CENTER (REAL WORLD)

Sorrento is starting to lose hope that he will find them the
room is so big there are so many rigs to check

INT ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)

Parzival approaches the legendary UNOPENABLE CRYSTAL GATE It
is famed for its lack of a keyhole but today it has THREE
keyholes Parzival takes out the Copper Key and places it
into the first key hole Then he puts the jade key in the
second and the crystal key in the third He turns the three
keys one by one then

THE CRYSTAL GATE OPENS leading into a spinning whirlpool of
stars Parzival steps through the gate

INT ANORAK’S CASTLE - STUDY (OASIS)

And into Anoraks study Towering shelves line the room
filled with ancient scrolls and dusty spellbooks And
floating in the center of the room

The egg

Parzival stares at it a large white oval with pixelated
edges He gently takes it in his hands in awe

Directly beneath a black dragon painting on an ornate
crystal pedestal sits a gold chalice encrusted with tiny
jewels Its diameter matches that of Parzival’s silver egg

Parzival places the egg in the chalice It fits perfectly

In the distance a fanfare of TRUMPETS grows and the egg
begins to glow

VOICE (0S)
You win

Parzival turns to see ANORAK standing right behind him His
obsidian black robes seem to pull the sunlight out of the
room

ANORAK
The game is over Its time for you
to receive your prize

Anorak holds out a long-fingered hand Parzival hesitates
then he takes it

Cascading bolts of blue lightning erupt in the space between
them their spiderweb tines enveloping them both

When the lightning subsides Anorak is no longer dressed in
his black wizards robes In fact he no longer looks like
Anorak at all

He’s James Halliday Pale middle-aged dressed in his Space
Invaders T-shirt

When Parzival looks down at his own avatar he sees HE is now
wearing Anoraks robes The icons and readouts around the
edge of his HUD now show his stats all completely maxed out
He now has a list of spells inherent powers and magic items
that seem to scroll on forever

And his credit readout now displays a number twelve digits
long

HALLIDAY
Congratulations Parzival Your
avatar is immortal and all-
powerful Whatever you want all
you have to do is wish for it
Pretty sweet right

PARZIVAL
Super sweet

Halliday leans toward Parzival and lowers his voice

HALLIDAY
So you ready to run this place

PARZIVAL
Actually I’m going to split it
with my friends

HALLIDAY
(nods)
Good thinking You need someone you
can trust worst mistake I ever
made was thinking I could do it

alone

PARZIVAL
I’ve got someone I trust Mr
Halliday

HALLIDAY

Don’t ever let her go

Halliday disappears Parzival barely has a moment to register
that he’s gone when he’s violently pulled from the OASIS

INT IOI HEADQUARTERS - THE REAL WORLD

Wade is suddenly pulled out of the Oasis and back into the
real world His rig is surrounded by IOI Security who also
hold Artemis hostage Nolan Sorrento holds a gun up to Wade

SORRENTO
Out Get out of the rig

Wade climbs out though he LEAVES HIS HEADSET with the
microphone facing out

SORRENTO (CONTD)
The notion that a piece of stack-
trash like you would ever run the
Oasis is laughable The entire
system would fall apart in days

WADE
Maybe But it’s better than the
future you’ve got planned out you
can of monkey balls

SORRENTO
Well I guess we’1ll just see about
that Because you’re not walking
out of here alive

WADE
I think you forget I’ve already
won I’m a God in the Oasis

SORRENTO
Youre not in the Oasis anymore

WADE
No but once I tell everyone that
they are released from any debt
incurred while in the Oasis and are
therefore free to log out right
now well

Sorrento turns to see hundreds of people rising up out of
their rigs

WADE (CONT’D)
I guess the question is how many
bullets do you have in that gun
punk

The crowd of downtrodden “Loyalists” close in on Sorrento

ARTEMIS
Put the gun down Sorrento It’s
over

The Guards seeing they have no chance let Artemis go

WADE
She’s right Nolan And before you
do anything stupider you might
want to hear about the offer I’m
prepared to make you now that I’m
in charge

Sorrento is nothing if not pragmatic He puts the gun down
Wade takes it away from him and then some of the loyalists

SORRENTO
Well what’s your proposal

WADE
Dude you killed a whole bunch of
people including my aunt You’re
going to jail that’s my proposal

Sorrento yells as he is dragged away
WADE (CONTD)
Don’t drop the soap
EXT IOI HEADQUARTERS - DAY (REAL WORLD)
As Sorrento is taken into police custody Wade and Artemis
are joined by Aech Shoto and Daito They do a communal three
slap hi-five because as goofy as it looks that is what’s

cool in 2044

WADE
First to the key

ALL
First to the egg

BY THE FOUNTAIN

Wade and Artemis share a quiet moment away from the crowd He
takes her hand

WADE
So what happens now

ARTEMIS
I don’t know

WADE
Maybe we should buy a really nice
apartment and move in together

ARTEMIS
Well we only just met a few days
ago

WADE

Yeah But Im in love with you
Artemis’ lower lip starts to tremble

ARTEMIS
Youre sure about that

WADE
Yes I am And I’m not gonna miss
my chance to tell you

Artemis leans over and kisses him We begin to pull back

WADE (VO)
As we stood there kissing it
occurred to me that for the first
time in as long as I could
remember

The kiss is still going

WADE (VO)
I had absolutely no desire to
log back into the OASIS

And as we pull back back we hear another voice

KID (0S)
Did all of that really happen

HISTORIAN (0S)
Exactly as it was told

INT WADE WATTS BIOGRAPHY -- THE OASIS

A young boy’s avatar -- ERNIE age ten -- follows the

Historian as he ambles down a long hallway closing all the
doors they’ve opened The narration of the movie has indeed
been Wade telling his own story just as Halliday told his

ERNIE
But what happened with the first
five Did Wade share the Oasis with
them

HISTORIAN
Of course Well until the great
schism But that’s next door in
volume three

ERNIE
The what

HISTORIAN

After the War of the Oasis in
volume two there was the Great
Schism When Shoto raised an army
of

(catching himself)
I don’t want to spoil it Off you
go now your class is leaving

ERNIE
Do you know any cheats for Aech’s
scavenger hunt

HISTORIAN
No and if I did I wouldn’t tell
you Off we go

ERNIE
Ill come back tomorrow

HISTORIAN
No need Try another book Or maybe
video games

ERNIE
I love Parzival and I’m coming back
every single day And I’m gonna
write my own memoir

The Historian looks less than thrilled as Ernie races off to
catch up with his class as they exit
EXT MEMOIR-OPOLIS (OASIS)

A long line of people snake down the street all waiting to
enter the most popular biography on Memoiropolis

READY PLAYER ONE THE STORY OF Z

Wade’s story is divided into three separate buildings one
for each volume

As we pan past the line we reveal other memoirs some more
crowded than others

COOKING WITH SWORDS -- Shoto and Daito’s poorly reviewed
cookbook
THE HUNT FOR JRC -- A badass account of how Artemis hunted

down a rogue JaRichard Cheney in the Oasis Wars

And finally

OASIS 20 Aech’s account of how she built the mysterious and
frightening Second Oasis that some claim exists INSIDE the
first Oasis

Ernie walks past them all a smile on his face a sparkle in
his eye Inspired as we all are by a great story no

matter what form it might take

GAME OVER
