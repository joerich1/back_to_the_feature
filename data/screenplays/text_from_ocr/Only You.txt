SUPER 1968

On a darkened living room a huge summer moon spilling silver
through a window

We move slowly across the mantelpiece where a pair of candles
glow illuminating family photos Weddings two maybe three
generations back -- brides in white their young grooms at
their sides frozen in time As we pan we hear two VOICES
offscreen a BOYS and a GIRLS

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Stop pushing it Youre not
supposed to force it Youre
supposed to just let it happen

BOYS VOICE (0OS)
Im not pushing it youre pushing
it

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
I am not

Silence Until

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Youre pushing it again

An exasperated sigh

BOYS VOICE (0S)
Well hurry up My foots falling
asleep

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Mo-mmm Larrys pushing it

Mom

MOM (OS)
(from the next
room)
Larry dont push it

And now we finally pan over to discover two KIDS playing with
a Ouija board For future reference the players are FAITH
(age eleven) and her brother LARRY (ten)

LARRY
IM NOT PUSHING IT

FAITH
Wait I have to write this down

A groan out of him She grabs a piece of paper and starts
scrawling out a series of letters

FAITH
Grandma told me everybody has a
soul mate

FAITH
But most people never find theirs
most people settle Im never
gonna settle

She gazes up as the ripe summer moon slips behind a bank of
clouds

FAITH
This way Ill know the name of the
man Im supposed to wait for

The arrow continues to move around the board stopping on
various letters which she copies down

LARRY
Yeah but what if this guy lived
a billion trillion years ago
Like what if he was a cave man
and now hes dead

FAITH
Dont be stupid Larry If hes
my destiny then obviously he
has to be alive

Another letter

LARRY
Yeah but what if he doesnt live
here Like what if hes a
cannibal in New Guinea or
something

FAITH
If I live here then he lives here
Fate wouldnt make a mistake like
that

(beat)
And stop talking Youre gonna
ruin the spell

Another pause Another letter Then Ever the devils
advocate
LARRY
(whispering)
Yeah but but Faith what if

he does live here and one day you
just walk past him on the street

I mean you dont hear his name
you dont get a chance to introduce
yourselves You practically bump
straight into each other but you
never even know it

Right in his face

FAITH
Well KNOW

LARRY
Okaaaaayyyy

The arrow comes slowly to a halt And she writes down the
final letter as the moon again breaks through the clouds
throwing a bright white beam of light directly onto the name
which reads

FAITH (0S)
(a whisper)
Damon Bradley
(she looks up
spellbound)
Hes the one

Beat
LARRY
Goodie Can I ask about the Series

now

CUT TO
EXT CARNIVAL - NIGHT

A screaming face Whirling lights A local carnival The
small-town traveling kind

SUPER THREE YEARS LATER

Up on the ferris wheel a bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
are distinguishing themselves by hurling water balloons down
at carnival-goers Among the participants is Faiths brother
Larry

PULL DOWN from them to MADAME DIVINAS FORTUNE TELLING
BOOTH Know Your Fate Clustered in front of it are a
bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS

We should recognize Faith as one of them Another girl
LESLIE is egging a friend on

LESLIE
Go on go on
(to the rest)
She wants to know if shes gonna
marry Alex

GIRL 2
I do not Im not gonna marry
Alex
(obviously)

He doesnt even have a car

LESLIE
But hes got pretty eyes That
means your kids would have pretty
eyes You can always get a car
later but you cant always find
pretty eyes You gotta think
ahead

GIRL 3
Who cares about pretty eyes
Leslie Im telling you stocks
bonds real estate -- thats what
you wanna look for in a man

GIRL 4
(dismissing)
Heh

GIRL 4
(the voice of
authority)

Definitely sex
Somebody else pipes up

GIRL 5
My mom told me you gotta want the
same things out of life Have the
same values be able to
communicate

They all turn to look blankly at this poor misguided soul

GIRL 5
Im just telling you what she said

Theyre still looking at her

GIRL 5
Its not like I believed her or
anything

FAITH

I think youre all wrong

LESLIE
What do you think the most
important thing is Faith

There is not a doubt in her mind

FAITH
True love I believe theres one
special person out there whos
meant for each of us And when
your eyes meet itll be magic and
youll both know it instantly

A couple of dissenters roll their eyes

FAITH
(turning to another
friend)
Dont you think so Kate

KATEs looking at the ground trying to sound casual

KATE
I dont know I guess I never
really thought about it
(in her next
breath)
Is Larry here

FAITH
(she couldnt care
less)
Yeah Hes around somewhere

Up above Larry takes careful aim then sends a water balloon
torpedoing their way It hits the ground between them with
an enormous SPLAT They SCREAM

INT FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH - NIGHT

We move past them through a beaded window and into the booth
where a disheveled older WOMAN MADAME DIVINA is paging
through a copy of Scientific American

heres a TAP at the door She checks her watch Curses

he shoves the magazine in a drawer then hoists a bowling
all the kind with the iridescent swirls in them onto an
pening in the center of the table carefully positioning it

o the three holes arent visible She flicks on a flashlight
bove it Crystal ball

CTHOONnNH

Back outside the girl everybody-thinks-is-going-to-marry-Alex
is nervous

GIRL 2
But what if she tells me something
bad I dont want to hear anything
bad

KATE
They never tell you anything bad
Nobodyd ever go to them if they
did

The door opens The WOMANS imposing hulk casts a shadow down
over them They look up

FORTUNE TELLER
Who knocked

Like deer in the headlights

GIRL 2
(pointing at Kate)
She did

KATE
(pointing at girl
2)
She did

Nobody moves until

FAITH (0S)
I did

Faith looks at her friends shrugs then gamely ventures
inside past the beads and sits down

FORTUNE TELLER
Whats your name

FAITH
Faith

FORTUNE TELLER
(lighting a candle)
What do you wanna know Faith

FAITH
Um just basic destiny stuff I
guess But-- I dont want to hear
anything bad
(beat)
If thats okay

Madame Divina starts laying out a series of tarot cards
Suddenly theres a loud KNOCK at the back door Faith jumps

FORTUNE TELLER
(dismissing)
Spirits
She lays down a couple more cards Then a persistent
PSSSSTTTT PSSSSTTT More BANGING

FORTUNE TELLER
(hollering)
Harry Im outta change

More KNOCKING Harry is determined Annoyed Mme Divina
finally gets up

FORTUNE TELLER
How come I always wind up next door
to the freak show
(as she goes)
Just because theyre midgets does
that mean they dont have to go
to the bank like the rest of us

She lumbers to the back of the booth throws open a back door
and looks down

FORTUNE TELLER
What

Inside Faith is nervously eying the cards Her friend KATE
peeks in through the beads

KATE
(mouthing the words
and pointing)
Is that a bowling ball

Faith doesnt understand Kate mimes a bowling motion
swinging her arm Faith shrugs As the woman returns from
outside we overhear

BOYS VOICE (0S)
Hey Kate Larry wants you

LARRY (0OS)
I do not

Kate grins ducks out Mme Divina sits back down Closes
her eyes Fingers the ball entranced

FORTUNE TELLER
Something is coming to me Im
getting a name
Faith leans forward

FORTUNE TELLER

(straining)
This name is very important to
you Da-- David No-- no

A faint breeze flutters through the room and the candle starts
to flicker

FORTUNE TELLER
Damon

Faiths heart skips a beat

FORTUNE TELLER
His name is
(her eyes pop open
with startling
intensity)
Damon Bradley

It is of course the same name

FAITH
Omigod Omigod
(getting up)
I have to go

She seizes Faiths hand

FORTUNE TELLER
Just a minute--

Faith freezes

FORTUNE TELLER
Your destinys two dollars

Faith pulls out two bills drops them on the table Bolts
for the door But the woman stops her again

FORTUNE TELLER
Hey--

She leans in very close and pulls Faith toward her We should
sense that this is not part of the act This is for real
FORTUNE TELLER
The truth is no matter what the
cards say you make your own
destiny Dont wait for it to come
to you You understand

Faith nods Still in shock

FAITH
Can I be excused now

CUT TO
SUPER TWENTY YEARS LATER -- SATURDAY NIGHT

We hear pouring rain But what sounds like rain is actually
the shower as we pull back to find Mitzi Gaynor washing that
man right out of her hair SOUTH PACIFIC is on television
We pull back even further to reveal three WOMEN watching

A big Saturday night Theres a lot of chocolate on the
table

The women are the adult FAITH Attractive a little dreamy
The walls of her apartment are adorned with reproductions of
famous works all featuring a similar theme Rodins The
Kiss Botticellis Birth of Venus etc Bookshelves are
crammed with volumes of poetry Shes absentmindedly pulling
the petals off a bouquet of flowers on the table

Also in attendance KATE her childhood friend turned
housewife and sister-in-law Kate is a pragmatist Shes
clipping coupons out of the newspaper as they watch And
doing her nails LESLIE Big hair Good heart Not the
sharpest tool in the shed

As the movie cuts to a commercial

LESLIE
Im just saying I think it would
be a good idea

KATE
(dubiously)
Date police
LESLIE

Yes A guy who says hes gonna
call then doesnt ought to get
slapped with a citation thats
all

Faith glances at Kate Theyre used to Leslie

LESLIE

(blowing on her

nails)
Anyway like I said Ive given
it a lot of thought and Ive
finally narrowed it down

(beat)
A heterosexual with a job

FAITH
Well I dont think its asking
too much to want to feel it in my
head and my heart and my body and
my soul all at the same time and
to have that feeling to be mutual
Pass the MandMs please

Her friends groan Theyre used to Faith Kate hands the
candy over

LESLIE
Not as long as youre not hoping
to find it on planet Earth

KATE
Leslies right Faith Youve got
to start being more practical
Do you know what the statistics
are the marriage odds for women
your age

FAITH
I dont believe in statistics

KATE
Youre an accountant for cryin
out loud

Faith holds out both palms gesturing that her point has been
made

KATE
What about that guy you work with
Mike whats-his-name
FAITH
(shaking her head)
No He smokes

KATE
How about the other one His
friend

FAITH
Just moved in with his girlfriend

KATE
(brightly)
How about that guy at the bank

Faith pops another MandM

Beat

FAITH
Scientologist
KATE
(deflated)
Oh
KATE

So you gotta be a little flexible
Look at your brother and me
Larrys not perfect neither am
I But we work it out Were not
unrealistic in our expectations
and we have each other

(setting down her

scissors)
I think youve got the Door Number
Three Syndrome

FAITH
Dont tell me Oprah did a show--

LESLIE
Yeah I saw that Like on Lets
Make A Deal Youve got the Amana
freezer and you can keep it or
risk it on whats behind Door
Number Three Which usually turns
out to be a donkey
Faith looks at Kate

FAITH
I dont have an Amana freezer

KATE
Its a metaphor Its women who
always think theres some unknown
out there thats going to be better
than whats in front of them And
instead wind up with nothing

FAITH
Metaphorically I still dont have
an Amana freezer

KATE
I think if youre honest with
yourself youll admit youve had
a chance at a number of Amana
appliances in your lifetime

She knows theres probably some ugly truth to this Luckily
the PHONE RINGS Faith picks it up

FAITH
Hello Hi Larry
(beat)
Yeah shes here Hold on
(turning to Kate)
Its your husband

INT LARRYS KITCHEN - NIGHT

INT FAITHS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Over the movie we hear yelling -- Kates half of the fight
-- in the background Then the SLAMMING of the receiver

When she comes back into the room the Some Enchanted
Evening number is on Faith is mouthing the words Kate
starts picking up her coupons

FAITH
Is everything okay

KATE

Yes

(glancing at the

tv annoyed)
You know all the shrinks on Donahue
say that all those love songs about
some enchanted evening are just
a cruel hoax that feeds peoples
fantasies

FAITH
(a little
plaintive)
But somebody wrote those songs

KATE
So whats your point

FAITH
Just that they came out of
somebodys experience is all
KATE

No Faith They came out of

somebodys imagination

EXT FAITHS DOOR - NIGHT

Faith walks her friends to the door opens it

FAITH

FAITH

FAITH

FAITH

I dont want to go out with in the
first place

KATE
If youve never been out with him

go out with him

LESLIE
(almost more to
herself)

Faith sighs Mercifully the elevator doors finally open
Kate and Leslie get in As the doors close

KATE
Take a chance Faith None of
us is getting any younger

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FAITHS APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

Faith exits her apartment and heads down the hall carrying

In another corner

KATE

How are golf clubs exploitation
(to a woman nearby)

She takes one night class and

suddenly shes a socialist

KATE

Sociologist And because

Dwaynes got a captive audience and is holding court near the
front door Faith is across the room a tray of food in her
hands The DOORBELL RINGS

DWAYNE

(ignoring it)
-Im not kidding All over the
metatarsus Corns the size of your

(searching)
You know the way tuna fish looks
when its been in the back of the
refrigerator for about six months
Anyway--

His listeners start silently returning their hors doeuvres
to the serving trays The doorbell RINGS some more

DWAYNE
(to Faith)
Honey could you get that Im
in the middle of a story here--

Faith sets down the tray Goes to the door Outside is
Leslie

LESLIE

Off her look

KATE

Dwayne pops his head in

DWAYNE
Hon-ey picture time

Faith gets up to follow him As they go he turns to her
DWAYNE

Her hair looks exactly as it has all evening But shes
anxiously trying to somehow rearrange it as the FLASH POPS
and the FRAME FREEZES

DISSOLVE TO

INT DOORWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

around her)
And just think This is only
the beginning

He kisses her forehead Releases her Heads for the bedroom

DWAYNE
Oh sweetie you wont forget to
pick up my cleaning tomorrow will

She starts to respond but-- hes already disappeared A
distant roll of thunder rumbles through the room The
candlelight flickers And the rain descends

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
A sea of white with a tiny face drowning in it Massive
sleeves an enormous hoop skirt tiers of cascading ruffles
drenched in acres of white sequins
FAITH
I feel like the Good Witch of the
North

Kates helping Faith try on her gown and veil

KATE
Come on its not so bad
FAITH
Look how big it makes me look
(she looks down)
I look like an Alp

KATE
I think it was sweet of him to pick
it out

FAITH
I know It was

Kate positions the veil on her head

KATE
But what
FAITH
(sighing)

Oh I dont know I guess its
just not quite the way I always
thought it was going to be You

KATE

Thats the problem When youre

a kid you think life is gonna be
like the movies Dreams come true

KATE
But one day you wake up and realize

compromise to overlook to
forgive Its not settling Faith
its life Real life

FAITH
I understand Kate
(beat)
What do you think of this garter

KATE

(careening out of

control)
I mean just how long are you going
to cling to this childish illusion
that its all supposed to be
perfect Well guess what
It isnt Not for you not for
anybody

Kate slams the pins down scattering them
silence

FAITH
(quietly)
Kate is something the matter

KATE
(shakily staring
up at the ceiling)
Larry brought me flowers last
night

FAITH

A long beat of
KATE

She buries her face in her hands
CUT TO
Theyre sitting down Faith is handing Kate kleenex

FAITH
Okay Now Have you talked to

Still looking down Kate mutely shakes her head no

FAITH
Have you seen him with someone

KATE
No I can just tell

FAITH
After all he is my brother and
I know he can be kind of a jerk
sometimes but I know him pretty
well and I really dont think--

The PHONE RINGS

FAITH
(reluctantly)
Dont move

Faith gets up and tries to head into the kitchen but the
unfortunate combination of the big dress and the small doorway
stop her She tries a variety of approaches before finally
turning the hoop skirt on an angle and suspending part of it
over her head enabling her to squeeze through the doorway
just far enough to knock the receiver off the hook and grab
it

FAITH
Hello

Theres a lot of noise on the other end

FAITH
Hello Is anybody there
PHONE
(louder over the
noise)
Dwayne Pinsley Im trying to
reach Dwayne Pinsley

herself free from
the doorway)

Kate hands Faith a pencil and the back of an RSVP card And

the second time in the movie we realize spells Damon
Bradley
The receiver clatters to the floor

FAITH
(dumbstruck)

Click

FAITH
But wait-- Hello Hello

But there is only a dial tone She stands there clinging
desperately to the receiver A woman adrift in a life raft
whos suddenly seen a ship appear then disappear back over
the horizon

EXT DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

Faith still in her wedding gown is racing to her car A
crazed gleam in her eye Kate is tagging after her

FAITH
Its a miracle

KATE
Its a coincidence

FAITH
The woman at my dry cleaners
believes theres no such thing as
coincidence

Kate looks at her So what

FAITH
(breathlessly)
Okay okay but dont you think
its a weird coincidence Doesnt
it seem like somebodys trying to
tell me something And not only
that take a look at this

Faith pulls a clipped copy of the days horoscope from her
purse Kate scans the column

KATE

Taurus Today can be a fresh start
and a new beginning

(dropping it to

her side)
Come on Faith they all say that
In my case it means Im gonna empty
the dishwasher

She snatches back the paper undeterred
FAITH
I just want to get a look at him
thats all

EXT ROADWAY - AFTERNOON

Faith is driving like a maniac her hoop skirt crammed in over
the edge of the dash blocking the lower half of the
windshield

EXT AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone
somehow manages to muscle the round hoop into an ellipse and
springs out the door

She mashes herself into one of those glass-partitioned
revolving doors but gets stuck making a few revolutions
before a couple of PASSERS-BY help pry her out on the other
side

She scans a departure screen for the flight to Venice and
buttonholes a SKY CAP He points to the distance

She hikes up her gown and starts sprinting through the
airport jumping luggage can-can-ing through the turnstiles

dodging kids running up the down escalator

INT ALITALIA CHECK-IN COUNTER - AFTERNOON

Faith flings herself across the counter

FAITH
(breathlessly)
Flight 417 Is it still here

The CLERK gives her the once-over He hasnt seen this ploy
in awhile

CLERK
May I see your boarding pass
please
FAITH
I-- I mustve misplaced it
CLERK

Im sorry but without a boarding
pass we cant let you on the plane

She starts digging through her purse at the same time slowly
inching her way past the little rope they put up to block
people

FAITH
(a smile)
Im sure Ive got it here

someplace
He smiles back And tightens the rope

CLERK
Great Because like I said until

FAITH
(panic rising in
her voice)
You dont understand The man Im
supposed to marry is on that plane

CLERK
Okay maam just a moment

He picks up his phone

CLERK
Yeah this is Mario over at
Alitalia
(sotto)

Weve got a 237 on our hands here
Uh huh Yeah Thanks

He hangs up The engines can be heard revving outside

CLERK
(back to her with
a plastic smile)
Itll be just a moment

We see a SECURITY GUARD approaching The Clerk starts waving
him over Meanwhile CREW MEMBERS off an arriving flight are
entering through a side door Using her dress as a shield
Faith manages to wedge a foot in it

As the clerk turns to address the guard she darts out and
starts sprinting across the tarmac for the plane-- where
theyve just finished pulling the portable stairs away from
the cabin door

As the plane starts to taxi the GROUND CONTROLLER waves
frantically at her to get out of the way With an anguished
cry she sinks to the ground as the jet SCREAMS overhead

INT AIRPORT BAR - AFTERNOON

CLOSE on a shooter of tequila A white-gloved hand picks it
up and downs it When

OS
Okay wheres the nut in the dress

The BARTENDER casts a sympathetic glance towards the end of
the bar Points Shes a pitiful figure this bride in her
torn wedding gown getting bombed all alone

SECURITY GUARD
(taking her by the
arm)
Look maam we agreed not to press
charges But Im afraid were
gonna have to ask you to leave

The bartender turns to her

BARTENDER
Can you drive Do you want us to
call you a cab

FAITH
(not at all fine)
No thank you Im fine

She gets up shakily

BARTENDER
I think we better call you a cab
(picking up the
phone)
Where is it you want to go

Her eyes drift to the DEPARTURE SCREEN Theres another
flight leaving for Venice in one hour And a sudden light
in her eyes
Kate is on the telephone

KATE
But youre afraid to fly

INT AIRPORT - NIGHT
Faith is at a pay phone Feeling no pain

FAITH
It was my New Years resolution
to overcome it

KATE (ON PHONE)
But its July

FAITH
Its still the new year

KATE (ON PHONE)
What about your job

FAITH
I have vacation time coming to me

KATE (ON PHONE)
You dont have a passport

FAITH
Thats where youre wrong I got
one nine years ago I just never
had an opportunity to use it

KATE (ON PHONE)
Because you were afraid to fly

FAITH
Would you stop saying that I need
you to do me a really big favor

INT KATE and LARRYS KITCHEN - NIGHT

KATE
Does Dwayne know about this

FAITH (ON PHONE)
Of course not I told him I was
going to visit a great aunt And

Kate glances disdainfully over at Larry whos engrossed in
the Home Shopping Club in the next room

KATE
How could I tell him Im not even
speaking to him

EXT DWAYNES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kate and Leslie are there Kate knocks No answer She
pulls a key from beneath the mat and opens the door

She calls out Dwaynes name No answer Nods to Leslie
INT AIRPORT - NIGHT

Faith still in her bridal gown is waiting impatiently at
the TWA terminal entrance Finally she spots Kate and Leslie
in the distance carrying a suitcase She rushes to them

FAITH
(anxiously to
Leslie)
Were you able to find it

LESLIE
At the very bottom of Dwaynes
closet

Faith clenches her fist in victory

LESLIE
But there wasnt a regular
yearbook picture of him in there
He mustve been absent that day
or something

Faiths face falls

LESLIE
However he was in the marching
band

Faith brightens again as Leslie pulls a contact lens case
from her purse She unscrews one side empties the contents
into Faiths palm A fuzzy little image the size of an
eraserhead Damon Bradley age 17 in the shadow of a tuba
Faith holds the virtually microscopic black and white speck
up under her nose examining it lovingly

FAITH
(touched)
Thanks Leslie

Then ever so carefully places it back into the case puts
the case in her purse and reaches for her suitcase Which
Kate is still holding onto

KATE
I cant believe we did this Do
I have to remind you that your
wedding is in six days

FAITH
Look I know you think this is
irresponsible of me but think how
much more irresponsible it would
be to marry the wrong person

FAITH (Contd)
What if Dwayne and I arent really
meant to be Is it fair of me to
waste his life

Kate reluctantly lets go Faith starts walking through the
terminal pulling clothes from the suitcase

They follow her into the ladies room where Faith changes
clothes

LESLIE
I think shes right You shouldnt
let a chance like this slip by
What if hes really The One

KATE

Les-lie hes not The One Shes
never even met this man

(to Faith)
You mean to tell me that youve
spent your whole life waiting for
somebody with this name--

(qualifying it)
this name you got from a Parker
Brothers game when you were
eleven--

FAITH
No I havent And you forgot
about the fortune teller

KATE
My God you have

Faith hands her gown and car keys to Leslie

FAITH
Thank you so much

KATE
Youre just going to fly to Italy
and start combing the streets

FAITH
(pulling a cocktail
napkin from her
purse)
He was on his way to Venice right
I called the tourist bureau and
I mustve called every hotel in
the city but I found where hes
staying

FAITH (Contd)
(giddy)
And Ive made a reservation

Kate shakes her head They exit out of the restroom and head
towards her gate

KATE
You dont even know what he looks
like You dont speak the
language You dont know your way
around This is a total stranger
in a foreign land

Shes starting to get a little caught up in this

KATE
A foreign land full of millions
of Italian men speaking Italian

with Italian accents and those huge
brown eyes and that silky olive
skin

FAITH
How hard can it be Ill land
there Ill go to his hotel Ill
introduce myself and--

KATE
Live happily ever after

FAITH
Maybe

Off Kates look

FAITH
Look until today I had forgotten
all about this And chances are
Ill find out hes not for me and
Ill come home and marry Dwayne
and never bring this up again
But what if this is the real
thing Kate What if this is the
real real thing

She steps aboard the escalator

FAITH
Wish me luck

EXT AIRPORT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Leslie is behind the wheel of Faiths car driving it home
Kate is at the wheel of her station wagon driving it back
home When at the last opportunity to recircle the airport
Kate suddenly cuts the wheel

INT AIRPORT WAITING AREA - NIGHT

CLOSE on a Lets Go Italy guide an Italian-English
Dictionary and a copy of How to Make a Man Fall in Love with
You Faith is waiting at the gate Shes packing the books
into her suitcase when the glitter of her ENGAGEMENT RING
catches her eye She looks around before furtively sliding
it off She opens the coin purse of her wallet and is placing
it inside when a pair of shoes appear in front of her

OS
Will you loan me some clothes
Startled she looks up Kate is standing there holding her
passport

KATE
(shrugs)
I keep it in the glove compartment
in case of emergencies

FAITH
Youre coming with me

Kate nods Faith throws her arms around her

KATE
Im not saying I think its a good
idea But if youre going to
insist on doing this I dont think
you should go alone You need to
be sensible about it

Their flight is announced They get up and start walking
towards the gate

FAITH
Youre right The key is to go
about this sensibly Logically
Rationally

As they go

FAITH
Did I tell you I figured out we
both have the same number of
letters in our names

INT JET - NIGHT

As the plane slowly taxis the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS go through
their standard litany of disaster As usual everybody is
ignoring them Except for one passenger who is looking
slightly green

KATE
You okay

FAITH
Sure Im fine I dont know why
I never did this before I mean
whats the big deal
The plane starts picking up speed

FAITH
Except for the fact that I could
lose my job

The landscape is beginning to blur

FAITH
I could lose Dwayne

Theyre rocketing down the runway

FAITH
(suddenly clutching
Kates arm)
Im afraid to fly

The ear-splitting SHRIEK of a jet engine as the plane takes
off

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARCO POLO AIRPORT VENICE - LATE AFTERNOON

The two women enter the terminal Kate is jet-lagged anda
little dazed Faith is like a kid on Christmas morning

FAITH
Were here were here were here
I cant believe were really here

As they make their way to the baggage claim theyre instantly

subjected to the Italian males tendency to treat every female
in sight as if she were the first woman hed ever seen in his

life Faith looks around ingenuously

FAITH
You know what It seems like
theres a lot more available men
in Italy

Kate rolls her eyes grabs Faith by the elbow and steers her
out of there

EXT DOCKS PIAZZALE ROMA - SUNSET
Our first view of Italy which visually is meant to be
idealized A place where the light is always golden and the
streets are full of magic and romance Its not the real
Italy its the Italy of guidebooks Of memories and
dreams

They stand at the edge of the docks which lead to the floating
city Faith looks around

FAITH
Now what do we do

KATE

The book said they have boats that
are like taxis

(scans LETS GO)
Vaporettos

(looking up)
Whats the name of the place were
staying again

FAITH
(cheerfully pulling
out the cocktail
napkin)
Its called the Gritty Palace

KATE
Gritty Is this gonna be one
of those youth hostel dives jammed
with backpackers who dont believe
in deodorant

FAITH
I dont know Maybe Think of
it as an adventure

Faith spots a vaporetto As they dash towards it somebody
pinches Kate

KATE
Ow What the--

She looks behind her The only person in the immediate
vicinity is a NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY looking innocent She WHACKS
him

KATE
Cretin
They step aboard just as the boat takes off and Faith gazes
out into the distance leaning out across the railing

FAITH
Oh look Kate look how
beautiful
And it is as they sail toward the splendor that is Venice

at twilight
EXT THE GRAND CANAL - TWILIGHT

Magic hour They float past ancient pallazi their crumbling
facades rejuvenated in the gentle evening light Gondoliers
glide by Candlelit windows cast shimmering patches of gold
down onto the water Its just like the movies Eventually
the DRIVER calls out

TAXI DRIVER
Gritti Palace

Faith can barely contain herself as they pull up alongside
one of the most elegant and expensive hotels in Venice
Former home to Hemingway and Maugham Dock lanterns glow
beckoning them into its sumptuous surroundings

FAITH
This is pretty ni-iice

Kate smiles then realizes

KATE
(grabbing Faiths
arm)
This is a Lifestyles hotel

FAITH

They arrive at the CONCIERGEs desk

CLOSE on a CREDIT CARD which reads LAWRENCE CORBETT Faith
looks at her Kate flashes a wicked smile

KATE

FAITH
(disbelieving)
Excuse me
CONCIERGE

Mr Bradley left about a half hour
ago He said his plans had changed
unexpectedly Would you prefer

an interior or exterior room

FAITH
(dazed)
He couldnt have checked out-- I

CONCIERGE
Im very sorry Perhaps you
misunderstood

He rings for the bellboy

FAITH
(trying not to
panic)
Are you absolutely sure hes gone
Maybe you made a mistake You

His polite veneer wearing thin the man pulls a key from the
honeycomb of slots behind him

CONCIERGE
Room 217 Would you like to go
up and check under the bed

She doesnt respond He replaces it

FAITH
Well which way did he go

The man stares at her blankly

FAITH
Nobody here has any idea which way
he went

CONCIERGE
(icily)
Once they pay the bill we dont
usually follow them

Kate leans across the counter and grabs him by the collar
pressing her forehead to his

KATE
Maybe you dont understand
(like shes
possessed)
My friend was supposed to meet him
here

He starts to wrestle with her Faith steps in to help pry
Kates fingers from the gentlemans neck

FAITH
(to him)

Excuse us

Hes still coughing as Faith leads her away from the desk into
the lobby

KATE
Well he was rude
They sit down
FAITH

I cant believe we came all this
way and hes gone

KATE
You gave it your best shot You
tried

FAITH

(a whimper)
We lost him

Kate nods sympathetically
KATE
You wait here Im gonna go get

Devastated Faith stares vacantly into space

FAITH
Ill never meet the man of my
dreams
KATE
(to herself as she

goes)
You and the other 99 of the women
in the world

As Kate heads back toward the check-in desk Faith gets up

and approaches the DOORMAN She pulls the contact lens case
from her purse Unscrews one side and holds it out in front
of him He starts laughing She darkens He sobers rattles
something off in Italian gesturing toward the distance

EXT STREETS OF VENICE - NIGHT

The two women race along over bridges under streetlamps
Faith is holding the case out in front of her sister-in-law

FAITH

of your shoe

Confused the guy looks down Faith reaches for his foot

FAITH
Do you mind if I just--

She takes the shoe turns it over twisting the mans leg and
knocking him off balance in the process Sending him toppling
into the water

FAITH
(peering down from
above)
Oh Im sorry

But the shoe is still in her hand She turns it over and
sure enough the tiny image is still perched there She licks
a finger and triumphantly picks it up like a crumb

Success Until a big gust of wind comes up whisking the
little likeness into the Grand Canal

INT GRITTI PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT
A puddle of water is forming on the marble floor

OS
It wasnt like I did it on purpose

Faith is dripping Looking like her world has come to an end
Shes holding a phone book as Kate drops tokens into a pay

KATE
You cant really blame him for
being upset It was an Armani
suit

FAITH
Did I or did I not offer to have

FAITH
Ah ha

KATE

FAITH
(charmed)
A Butterfinger wrapper

KATE
A rich possibly fat slob

FAITH

man Faith were trying to locate
him

FAITH
Oh Right

She drops it Starts digging through the wastebasket again
DISSOLVE TO
A small pile of garbage spread out on the floor -- an apple

recently found out that hes here
in Italy And Im here trying to
find him

Thats the ticket

FAITH
You could say Im sort of looking
for my other half

She smiles nervously

KATE
And shes going to be married in
five days and it would mean so
much to her if she could find him
before her wedding day

Teary-eyed Faith nods

FAITH
(pleading)
All I ask is that you just call

him if they have any idea where
we might find him

He looks at her
CONCIERGE
And then you promise youll go

CONCIERGE

Hangs up They look at him expectantly

CONCIERGE
(handing back the
message)
He said he thinks a woman he works
with knows him Her names Anna
But she wont be in til tomorrow

FAITH
So How do we get to Rome

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - SUNRISE
Somewhere in Tuscany Where the landscape looks like one of

those old Renaissance paintings Undulating hills
sun-dappled olive groves vast vineyards crumbling
farmhouses They speed into the frame aboard a vespa
is at the handlebars

KATE
(over the wind)
Couldnt we just have taken a
train

FAITH
(shaking her head)
The book said they have a lot of
rail strikes in Italy

FAITH
This way were in control
Besides look how pretty this is
Were really getting to see the
countryside

Faith

They speed off And a BUG smacks straight into Kates mouth

DISSOLVE TO

LATER The front wheel of the vespa is rotating very slowly

Thats because theyre pushing it In silence until

FAITH
(quietly)
I told you a liter was less than
a gallon

KATE
(snapping)
We wouldve had enough gas to get
us there if you hadnt gotten us
lost Besides a kilometer is less
than a mile

FAITH
Right So we shouldve been able
to cover more of them

Silence

KATE
Boy we sure are seeing the
countryside alright

Beat

KATE
Im hungry

FAITH
You know no offense or anything
Kate but I think Im starting to
see Larrys side of the story

KATE
Whats that supposed to mean

FAITH
Nothing

They plod along again in silence

FAITH
(throwing up her
hands)
I thought all roads were supposed
to lead there anyway

DISSOLVE TO

LATER STILL Theyve stopped to rest The sun is beating
down mercilessly

Faith gets up stands at the side of the road arm and thumb
extended

KATE
I dont know that we should be
accepting any rides from strangers

Faith just looks at her

FAITH
You expecting somebody you know

KATE
Well you dont have to get snippy

with me

FAITH
Sorry
After a beat

KATE
(wounded)
So what exactly is Larrys side
of the story anyway

FAITH
I dont know Kate I just said
that Im sorry Im just on
edge
(gazing into the
distance)
Im afraid were losing him

KATE
(staring vacantly
ahead)
You think he misses me at all

FAITH
Course he does

KATE
You know when Larry and I got
married I thought we were so lucky
we found each other so early
People talk about spending their
lives together how many of them
really get to But maybe I was
wrong Maybe sooner or later
everything wears out

Faith turns to look at her sister-in-law She goes over and
kneels down next to her

FAITH
Remember in junior high when I
had that Halloween party And we
were playing Twister And it
landed on right-hand-red and there
was only one red spot left You
reached for it but you started
to fall

FAITH
And instead of taking it Larry
reached out to catch you He let
you win Larry never let anybody
win Thats when I knew He was
a goner

Kate is idly doodling in the dirt with a twig

KATE
That was a long time ago

FAITH
And you know what I thought then
Kate I thought I hope someday
I have somebody who loves me that
much
(a confession)
I still hope that

Still looking down Kate smiles ruefully

KATE
That youll find someone wholl
let you win at Twister

She looks up eyes full of doubt Faith nods solemnly

KATE
He went out and bought himself
mens cologne the other day Did
I tell you that

FAITH
(concerned)

Larry bought himself cologne

KATE
Polo

Uh-oh

Faith puts a consoling arm around her and they sit there in
the Tuscan countryside In quiet contemplation of the
capriciousness of life and love

INT SQUASH COURT - DAY

Dwayne and Larry are playing Larrys clothes are very
wrinkled
LARRY
So she just takes off on me No
warning No explanation Just
this message on the machine Im

Larry smacks the ball

DWAYNE
I dont get it She hasnt seen
her since she was a kid now just
because shes dying all of the
sudden shes gotta see her again

LARRY
Shes been acting weird lately
though I shoulda seen it coming
Babbling on and on and on about
communication Like I dont know
how to communicate

DWAYNE
Lets face it Sooner or later
we all die

LARRY
Exactly

After a beat Larry stops the ball

LARRY
Whos dying

DWAYNE

EXT COUNTRY ROAD IN TUSCANY - DAY

Theyre walking again both holding thumbs out now And their
prayers are answered A bright red FERRARI comes screeching
to a halt about ten feet in front of them They exchange a
look Faith dashes towards it Peers in the window
converses with the driver a moment then waves Kate over
KATE
(lugging the
suitcase)
You really think this is safe

An interior shot of the car reveals a NUN behind the wheel

FAITH

Kate takes a look inside

KATE
God the Catholic Church is even
richer than I thought

She climbs in and the car PEELS OUT
EXT STREETS OF ROME - DAY

They screech to an abrupt halt directly in front of

SISTER MARGHERITA
Ai Monasteri

They get out and are still thanking her profusely standing
at the side of the car with suitcase in hand when there is
a whisper from behind

OS
Do you believe in love at first

(like an oath)

Yes

She turns To discover that God is a practical joker The
guy is talking to Kate Slicked back hair ponytail a lot

INT AI MONASTERI - DAY

She starts ranting in Italian Faith pulls out her dictionary
and starts flipping frantically through it Kate comes over
with a handful of little bottles

KATE

Ask her if she knows where he is

GIOVANNI

She screams for about a minute He turns to Faith

GIOVANNI

FAITH
Ask her if she knows how I might
reach him If she has a telephone
number

GIOVANNI
Ha un numero di telefono

She yells some more

GIOVANNI
She did but she
She rips a napkin into shreds

GIOVANNI

More yelling

GIOVANNI

ANNA

She hits her inner elbow with the edge of her other hand in
the Italian version of the finger

GIOVANNI

FAITH
Whats mezzaluna

GIOVANNI
A restaurant In Piazza Navona

FAITH
(ecstatic)
Thats it Thats it Thats all

Giovanni)
Bless you thank you thank you

The PROPRIETOR rushes in from the back of the store makes
her apologize to the nice customers

ANNA
(grudgingly)
Sorry

PROPRIETOR
(thats better)
Cosi va bene

As Faith heads toward the door she yells after her

ANNA
Im sorry your brother is a pig
KATE
(with the bottles)
Who is it I pay for these

CUT TO
EXT AI MONASTERI - MOMENTS LATER

As they emerge from the shop and head down the stairs Kate
is looking skeptical

FAITH
All that proves is that she wasnt
the woman who was meant for him

Faith throws her arms around her in celebration dancing in
the street

FAITH
And now we know where hes gonna
be

EXT PENSION - AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON a sign PENSIONE DIVINO AMORE Giovanni is helping
them carry their things into the hotel He leads them to
their room opens the door Faith enters As Kate follows
he momentarily pulls her aside

GIOVANNI
(apologetically)
I must leave town for two days
Was unavoidable But day after
tomorrow
(with import)
I return

He places the key in her hand Holding his own there longer
than necessary

INT PENSIONE ROOM - LATER

Faith is in the shower Kates got an Italian smorgasbord
arrayed before her Is browsing How to Make a Man etc

EXT PENSION - EVENING

Theyre on their way out the door dressed to the nines As
Kate turns their key in to the desk Giovanni whispers in her
ear

GIOVANNI
Forty-eight hours

Nods meaningfully
EXT PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT

They emerge from a cab into a dreamlike landscape illuminated
by the lights Berninis Fountain of the Four Rivers and the
strolling FIRE-EATERS performing in the piazza Everything
seems to be moving in slow motion

FAITH

All of the sudden Im feeling kind
of nervous

(wringing her

hands)
God I hate blind dates Why
couldnt we just have arranged
marriages in America

KATE
Youre right At least that way
you could spend the rest of your
life blaming your parents instead
of yourself Smile

Faith smiles And they enter the restaurant -- a sea of
frescoes flowers crystal and silver all awash in
candlelight Some Enchanted Evening

From Faiths POV we see various and sundry men acknowledge
or appear oblivious to her expectant face A smile here a
glance there He could be any of them Or none of them

FAITH
(through her smile)
Lets get a drink

They take a seat at the bar Unbeknownst to them an
extremely handsome MAN at a table on the terrace is eying them
intently

KATE
Arent you going to ask the
maitred if hes here
Its all come down to this A whole lifetime of waiting
searching hoping

FAITH
(suddenly chicken)
I sort of wanted to wait to see
if maybe hed notice me first

KATE
Youve travelled over six thousand
miles and now youre gonna play
hard to get

The MAN from the terrace is getting up Is coming their way
Kate elbows her Some Enchanted Eeeevening

KATE
(sotto)
Hes a god

He approaches

ADONIS
Excuse me I hope you dont think
Im being too forward Im here
waiting for a friend but I
couldnt help noticing the two of
you

Faith is giddily kicking Kate under the table but no words
are coming out Kate steps in

KATE
We noticed you too

Its really happening
ADONIS
I was wondering if you might be
persuaded to join me--
It really is
KATE
(getting up)

Wed love to

ADONIS
(extending a hand)
Great Im Guiseppe Romano

Faiths face falls
CUT TO
Theyre back at the bar by themselves

KATE
So whats in a name I wanna join
him I dont see why we cant join
him

FAITH
I told you If he sees me here
with another guy hes gonna think
Im here with another guy I just
dont want to send any confusing
signals

Kate glances back over at him Waves

KATE
(to Faith)
Well how come were always looking
for guys for you

FAITH
Because Im the one whos single

KATE
(sulking)
I never even got to be single

FAITH
Sure you did

KATE
Not if you dont count the sixth
grade

FAITH
Okay okay You join him But
first will you ask if hes here

We watch from a distance as Kate gets up and approaches the
MAITRED He gestures towards a booth on the other side of
the room She thanks him and makes a beeline back to the bar
KATE
Hes heeeeeerrre

FAITH
(nervously looking
around)
Oh my God Where

KATE
Hes sitting in the fourth booth
down on the left hand side with
his back to us Hes wearing a
navy jacket If you turn around
you can see part of his right
elbow

FAITH
(not moving a
muscle)
Is he looking at us

KATE
(glancing over her
shoulder)
Nope

Faith tries to peek around without being too obvious And
slips off her bar stool almost knocking over the drink of
the person next to her She grabs it awkwardly climbs back
onto the stool Then pulls out a compact and checks out the
view

FAITH
(like shes twelve)
Oooooo I can see his sleeve

After a beat
FAITH
I guess I should just go over and
introduce myself huh
Kate nods Faith puts the mirror away Starts to get up
FAITH

(sitting back down)
Who do I say I am
CUT TO

Moments later Having gotten her story straight She gets
up again

FAITH
Right right Okay
(suddenly seized
with self-doubt)
You dont think hes gonna think
Im too aggressive

KATE
Faith So far youve trailed the
man halfway around the globe At
this point I dont think another
fifteen feet is gonna tip the

scales

FAITH
Right Okay Its meant to be
right

(a deep breath)
This is it

She straightens her skirt Starts to walk toward him again
when

KATE
Faith--
FAITH
(turning anxiously)
What
KATE
Good luck

Faith smiles gratefully back at her Kate motions go on
Then turns back towards Guiseppe Faith collects herself

A woman with a mission Begins striding purposefully towards
him

Focused only on that special arm as with each step a little
more of it comes into view

Only a few more feet There is nothing between her and him
now but that WAITER with the enormous tray of pasta coming
from the other direction But alas In a collision worthy
of inclusion in the agony of defeat the tray and all its
contents go sliding down over her All eyes turn her way

and she stands there paralyzed in an agonizing moment of dead
silence Then with an anguished howl she dashes to the
ladies room Kate gets up and goes rushing in after her

And back out in the restaurant a pair of feet get up and
step gingerly over the remains of somebodys angel hair pasta

Seconds later with an enormous wet orange spot on her dress
Faith bursts out of the ladies room And discovers hes gone

The women bolt out the door just in time to glimpse a man
in a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the
distance In hot pursuit Faith flings off her heels and
sends them flying One of them BONKS a PASSER-BY another
MAN clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket on the
head We may get only a brief look at this guy but its
enough to establish that while he may not be drop-dead
gorgeous any woman with any sense wouldnt kick him out of
bed for munching saltines either Theres an undeniable
warmth in his eyes

But Faith doesnt see him at all because as he bends down
to pick up her shoe he disappears from sight in the crowd
and she races madly past him Down the subway stairs into
the tunnel-- and into a mob

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

She battles her way through the throng hopping up and down
to try to get an overview but there is no sign of him She
dashes from car to car pounding on windows calling out his
name Until in a sudden whoosh the doors close and the
train speeds off into the night

But shes still running after it Desperately Until it
finally vanishes around a corner out of sight And she sinks
to the ground arms outstretched in the darkness in vain

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT
CLOSE ON an abandoned shoe A hand picks it up

KATE (0S)
I found one

The two of them are wandering the piazza Faith puts the shoe
back on and with one bare foot limps over to a table Her
dress is stained her nylons are run a few stray noodles
still cling to her hair Basically shes a disaster

As they sit down

KATE
Well nobody can say we didnt try

FAITH
(not hearing this)
Okay heres what I think We
find out what all the subway stops
for that train are-- the subway
systems really not that big in
Rome we could narrow it down and--

KATE
(not believing
this)
And then what Faith

FAITH
And then we rent a truck or
a car either one and we set up
a loudspeaker and we drive through
the surrounding areas and we page
him

Simple as that Kate just stares at her dumbfounded

FAITH
What My hair

When

OS
I like the style I just dont
think this color works for me

They look up Its the STRANGER in white with her other shoe
in his hand

FAITH
Oh
(reaching for it)
Thank you

DAMON
Allow me

He kneels down and places the shoe on her foot Then gazes
up into her eyes

FAITH
Thanks very much
(back to Kate)
So what do you think

Kate looks at him Kind of charmed

KATE
That was really sweet

FAITH
I meant about my idea

KATE
I think its time we got some
professional help

FAITH
(nodding)
Like a detective

KATE
No Like a psychiatrist

FAITH
(looking around)
Dont be silly Hows a
psychiatrist gonna find him

Hes still kneeling there

FAITH
(to him again)
Thank you

Now go away He sits down at a table nearby Stares over
at Faith She spots an Italian policeman or CARABINIERE
standing at the edge of the piazza

FAITH
Im gonna go see what I can find
out about speaker rental

She gets up the STRANGER gets up as if to follow She looks
at him like hes nuts

FAITH
Excuse me

Steps around him to head toward the cop He sits back down

DAMON
(to Kate)
So whats the story with your
friend
KATE
(watching her in
amazement)
My friend has lost her fucking
mind
DAMON

Whats she doing
Kate turns to him

KATE
Shes trying to find out where she
can rent a loudspeaker

DAMON
What for

KATE
So she can drive through the
streets of Rome paging the man of
her dreams

He laughs

DAMON
No really Whats she doing

KATE
Really She thinks hes here
Even though shes never met him
Even though shes never laid eyes
on him

DAMON
(still not
believing her)
Seriously
Kate just looks at him

DAMON
Oh Well whats wrong with that

He gazes over at her gesticulating wildly in the distance
DAMON
Only if shes never met this
guy what makes her think hes
perfect for her

Kate just shakes her head Dont ask

DAMON
Were they pen pals

KATE
No
DAMON
Is he some kind of celebrity or
something
KATE
No
DAMON
Did he do some anonymous good deed
for her
An exasperated sigh
KATE

She got his name off a Ouija board
when she was eleven

She holds out her palms What can I tell you
A beat Then

DAMON
What is his name

Faith comes trudging back in tears

FAITH
He said it would take at least six
months to get a permit for a
loudspeaker And you have to get
the Pope to approve it

Defeated she picks up her purse

FAITH
Lets just go

Kate puts her arm around her and they start walking
STRANGER grabs his jacket off the back of his chair

after them

DAMON
(anxiously)
Will you be staying in Rome long

She doesnt respond

DAMON

Your friend said you were looking
for someone

(at her side)
Maybe I can help you track him
down I speak a little Italian
And I have a friend who works at
the embassy Maybe we could--

Shes trying to wave down a TAXI

FAITH
Thank you but I really dont want
any help

DAMON

Whats his name Ill look into
it for you I could give you a
call

A CAB slows to a stop in front of them

FAITH
Look I appreciate the offer but--

She reaches for the door Hes standing in the way

DAMON
Just tell me his name

The
Tags
She blows her nose noisily

FAITH
(to get rid of him)
Damon Bradley

He stares at her

DAMON
(stunned)
But thats-- Im Damon Bradley

Still wiping her nose she notices the jacket in his hands
then looks up into his eyes The wind rustles through the
trees

FAITH
Youre

He nods Amazed
FRANCESCA

And youre the biggest mess Ive
ever seen

She reaches for her hair

FRANCESCA
I find that very attractive

And she faints Dead away
INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Having regained consciousness Faith is across a candlelit
table from him Theyre engrossed in conversation In each
others eyes Tables around them have all emptied A waiter
in the background is trying to prop his eyes open

DAMONS MOTHER
Coming so close and yet just
missing each other Do you know
what I mean

Does she know what he means

DAMONS MOTHER
Theres this poem by Rilke I dont
remember the whole thing but its
about that About waiting for that
person and wondering if youll
ever find them And the last line
of it goes Who knows Perhaps
the same bird echoed through both
of us yesterday--

FAITH

spellbound)

Moments later having changed clothes floats back out and
they take off again Up above Kate watches wistfully out
the window

DRY CLEANERS - Dwayne is there trying to pick up his stuff
The CLERK is holding out a ticket You have to have one of
these

THE FORUM - The sun is coming up over the ruins Faith and

Damon stroll through them Damon pulls out a doggie bag

Sets down a little container of pasta for the wild cats that
roam Rome

DAMONS MOTHER
Your hair is perfect

He leans in and kisses her And from this angle except for
the clothes they look an awful lot like Rodins version as
the FRAME FREEZES

CLOSE on the photo She looks up from it
FAITH

You dont think this is just
infatuation do you

FRANCESCA
Oh no
(beat)
Do you
FAITH
No

He takes her hand Both a little unnerved they walk Until

DAMONS MOTHER
But just to be sure maybe we
ought to shatter each others
unrealistic images of perfection
You know each of us admit
something embarrassing about
ourselves

FAITH
Okay Good idea You first

FRANCESCA
Me first Alright well
(beat)
Something embarrassing right
Something we dont want to admit
in public

She nods He thinks a moment Then
FRANCESCA
(sheepish)

She looks at him with amazement

FAITH
Im a liberal
FRANCESCA
(disbelieving)
No

EXT VIA MARGUTTA - TWILIGHT

A lantern-lit street of 18th century facades A faint breeze
stirs the trees above Strains of opera float out a window
Faith is looking around Finally though theyre not
overlooking anything

FAITH
Youre right This is a really
pretty view

He smiles

DAMONS MOTHER
Not this

He leads her out to the center of the street Tilts his head
back She follows and they walk with their necks craned
back like two drunken sailors like two kids

DAMONS MOTHER
This

And up above in the houses and apartments lining either side
of the street visible through the unshuttered windows are
gilded ceilings and candlelit vaults of angels And beyond
those the star-studded indigo summer sky

Its all a matter of how you look

at it

BARTENDER

KATE
The point is he was sleeping with

KATE

BARTENDER
(nodding gravely)
She was your sister

BARTENDER
(shaking his head
in sympathy)
Your mother

KATE
Of course not

BARTENDER
(another stab)
Your grandmother

KATE
Look she wasnt a relative okay

Big deal He rolls his eyes and dismisses it with a wave of
his hand

KATE
So how much longer til Giovanni

FAITH
I feel like Ive been wandering
in the desert for as long as I can

blue somehow Ive found the oasis

Solemnly

straws)
Look if the names that much of

She opens the taxi door

FAITH
(on the brink of
tears)
How could you do this to me

PETER
(innocently)

Oh come on What kind of an
excuse is that

And this time the door SLAMS in his face

But how could he know He only

out to be a pathological liar

Faith wails
INT PETERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PENSION ROOM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

Kate is on her way out the door She opens it-- to find Peter
outside in the hallway carrying a bouquet of flowers the size
of a refrigerator

PETER
(moving past her)
I have to talk to her

KATE
Shes not here

PETER
Where is she

KATE
She went out to check into
skywriting I cant believe you

laid

PETER
No Thats not fair Thats not
it at all Look something
somewhere got screwed up Maybe
some metaphysical wires got
crossed I may not have the right
name but I was there Im the
guy Im-- skywriting

She eyes him skeptically

KATE
You didnt think this would be a
problem
He starts pacing
PETER

It was an emergency I only lied
that night because it was the only
way I knew to stop her I knew

if I didnt Id never see her
again

KATE
Good strategy

PETER
Do you know I wasnt even supposed
to be in Rome My boss was
supposed to come to this
conference and at the last minute
he got the measles The measles
Who gets the measles at
forty-three So they sent me
And I wasnt supposed to be in that
piazza that night either Id gone
to the movies only it was sold
out So I was wandering around
Just wandering When I got hit
in the head with this shoe

He gazes out at the Roman skyline

PETER
And then I saw her And all I know
is when I looked in her eyes I
saw something light And life
and passion and yearning And
something else I cant even put
my finger on something Id never
seen before--

KATE
Mania

PETER
Whatever And I thought please
God give me a sign give me some
way to keep this woman from getting
into that taxi and disappearing
from my life forever And He did
She told me the name Granted
it wasnt my name but it was a
start

He turns to Kate

PETER
And if thats not destiny I dont
know what is

KATE
(touched)
Thats really romantic

She places a consoling hand on his shoulder

KATE
Too bad she hates your guts

Starts leading him toward the door

PETER

Its just a name for chrissakes
The whole thing is so ludicrous
For all she knows this guy could
be the biggest loser on the face
of the planet He could have a
criminal record

(throwing up his

hands)
He could think Ronald Reagan was
a great president

Kate shrugs
PETER
I mean realistically what are
the odds that this is a terrific
guy

KATE
(flatly)
Ten billion to one

Beat

Theres a KNOCK at the door She opens it

the engine)
Are you sure people are gonna be
able to read this

The pilot nods The plane goes into a dive Faiths eyes
roll back in her head

EXT PENSION TERRACE - DAY

Kate and Giovanni are at a table overlooking the domes of

nervously)
Dont you have to be getting back

His eyes sparkle
GIOVANNI
Its siesta
KATE

(softening she

stops)
Look Peter I dont hate you
But what we had was an illusion
Mutual wishful thinking We both

but it was all founded on a lie

PETER
So

FAITH
So it wasnt real

PETER
What about the oasis in the desert
Are you telling me that was a lie

FAITH

No that wasnt a lie That was
(almost more to
herself)

a mirage

She looks at him Then softly sadly

Youre the man of somebody elses

She checks her hair starts adjusting it in the reflection
of a window Then peeks around the corner

ANGLE ON a MAN reclining on a lounge chair We start at the
feet which dont quite reach the end of the chair Move up
the legs past the pot belly to sure enough an enormous
gold medallion resting on his chest A fringe of hair skirts
the perimeter of his head -- and his back

A copy of Mickey Spillanes latest rests on a table next to
him Hes lying back eyes closed This is Damon Bradley
This is Him
Peter smiles broadly Faiths face falls

KATE
Thats him

Faith elbows her

KATE

back at Kate for support

Uh-hem excuse me hello

MAN AT POOL

(hopping out of

Oh Sorry

He closes his eyes

FAITH
(like an idiot)
Do you have the time

He eyeballs her like shes some sort of curious life form

MAN AT POOL
Do I look like Im wearing a watch

He doesnt

FAITH
No I guess not I just thought
maybe--

When someone at the edge of the pool calls out

OS
Hey Damon

But the person shes talking to doesnt respond Instead
somebody else another MAN whod been doing laps in the pool
emerges

HIM
Yeah

This is no ordinary mortal this is a living monument to
mankind He couldve modeled for Michelangelo Mel Gibson
feels like Jo-Jo-the-Dog-Faced-Boy next to this guy The guys
in the Calvin Klein ads-- okay lets say he looks like one

of those guys
Kates eyes shift to Peter who suddenly sobers
Back at the pool a LITTLE KID is talking to Damon

LITTLE KID
Thanks for letting me borrow this

The kid sets the Spillane tome back on his chair

HIM
No problem

He gets out and starts toweling off a halo of sunlight
glistening off his tanned muscular body reflecting in the
deep green pools of his eyes She grabs hold of a nearby
chair as her knees start to give way

FAITH
(barely audible)
Youre Damon Bradley

HIM
Uh huh

Oh My Goddd
Its now or never She takes a deep breath Lets it out

FAITH
Excuse me

Its never She goes running back inside

KATE
(whispering loudly)
Whatareyoudoing

FAITH
(spinelessly)
What if he doesnt like me

KATE
It means youre a completely
worthless excuse for a human being
and the fates have all conspired
to make you miserable

FAITH
My God youre right
KATE
Faith Im kidding
(stopping her)
Is this how you plan to get what
you want from life When you
finally find it you turn and run
away from it

She gazes fearfully back out to the terrace
PETER
Hey if she doesnt wanna meet him
she doesnt wanna meet him

Kate glares at him Takes Faith by the shoulders

KATE
You have overcome everything it
took to get here Every obstacle
to reach this moment This fateful
moment Now its in your hands
She points toward the terrace

KATE
Is that what you want

Is this a trick question

KATE
Then go get it

PETER

I dont know what youre talking

starring in the local play

A bead of sweat rolls down his neck
FAITH
You did didnt you You got
somebody to pretend to be him
Tell me the truth For once

He takes a deep breath

PETER
Alright The truth is I thought
we had something here

FAITH
I cant believe you did that

PETER
And I cant believe you are so
stubborn and so blind as to let
some stranger some phantom youve
never even met destroy it

FAITH
(turning on him)
Youre the reason I never met him
You knew it was the thing I most
wanted in life and you sabotaged
it

PETER
I sabotaged it Youre the one
who lost him remember

FAITH
Well I mightve found him again
if I hadnt left Rome to make this
pointless trip down here with you

PETER
As I recall you were on your way
home And I didnt want you to
go so yes I told you a little
white lie

A little white lie A little
white lie

PETER
What would you call it

Silence

PETER
Dont you think youre overreacting

about love okay Lets be
rational

FAITH
Rational Love is not rational
Are you crazy
PETER

(throwing up his

hands)
Yes Im crazy You have driven
me crazy No one in their right
mind would go to this much trouble
to win over someone as insane as
you Did it ever even for one
second occur to you how much work
it was to set all this up How
many arrangements had to be made
How many players had to be
coordinated

FAITH
Gee Im flattered What an
incredibly romantic gesture
Cancel the roses Ive decided to
lie to her instead

PETER
Very funny

FAITH
No it isnt I called off my
wedding all because of you

A beat

Then

PETER
(touched)
Really

FAITH
(realizing this
herself for the
first time)
Yes

PETER
And this is the thanks I get I
did you a favor You never wanted
to marry that joker in the first
place

FAITH
Thats not the point
(realizing shes
just given herself
away)

And what if I had wanted to

PETER
If you had wanted to youd have
gone home

Then more calmly

PETER
Look I just thought if you finally
got rid of this obsession with this
name if you could get it out of
your system once and for all then
maybe youd be able to stop waiting
and open your heart to someone
real Granted ideally me I
didnt do it to hurt you I did
it for you

(beat)

I did it for us

FAITH
There is no us

His eyes harden

PETER
