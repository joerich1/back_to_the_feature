INT SAN VITTORE PRISON MILAN - DAY

CLOSE ON AN ASHEN-FACED WOMAN

Wrap-around sunglasses cover her eyes A burning cigarette in
her hand A tower of ash lands next to her off-white sneaker

This is PATRIZIA REGGIANI (50s) She addresses us directly

PATRIZIA
I don’t believe in lessons- I was a
lousy student Nothing puts me to
sleep faster than a book So I hope
you don’t think I’m trying to teach
you a moral lesson here or tell
you something you already know I
just want you to hear my story to
know the facts before it got all
distorted Before journalists took
it out of my hands

INT CAFE VIA PALESTRO MILAN - DAY

ON MAURIZIO GUCCI 47 Three-piece suit Persols
Effortlessly elegant Finishes his coffee

PATRIZIA (VO)
It was a name that sounded so
sweet so seductive Synonymous
with wealth style power

INT SAN VITTORE PRISON MILAN - DAY

She removes her sunglasses and we get a glimpse of her VIOLET
EYES They are both electric and intimidating

PATRIZIA
But that last name was a curse
too It belonged to a Tuscan
family They didn’t fight over land
or crown They fought over their
own skins and the leather of their
sacred cows

INTEXT CAFE VIA PALESTRO MILAN - DAY

Maurizio steps out of a café and walks briskly along the
sidewalk avoiding the road A man calls out behind him

MAN
Signor Gucci

funnier Count But c’est la vie

Count Sarzana smiles awkwardly

INT PALAZZO DEGLI OMENONI BALLROOM- NIGHT

Maurizio and Patrizia slow-dance to Il Cielo in una Stanza by
Mina Maurizio is a terrible dancer And he’s twice her
height She leads swaying to the music and helping him
along She’s a good teacher and endeared by his ungainliness

PATRIZIA (VO)
I liked the way he smelled It felt
like home Like I’d met him before

Maurizio subtly looks at his Jaeger Lecoultre Reverso watch
It’s MIDNIGHT He pulls away from Patrizia

PATRIZIA
Is my dancing that bad

MAURIZIO
Forgive me I’m sorry

He holds her hand affectionately Then looks down at their
interlocked hands and quickly “snaps” out of it

PATRIZIA
It’s only midnight Cinderella
The night is young

MAURIZIO
I turn into a frog at midnight

They exchange smiles
PATRIZIA

(loudly)
It’s a pumpkin Not a frog

INT VILLA NECCHI CAMPIGLIO- MEMORY ROOM

Maurizio walks down the long hallway in his family’s stately
villa He stops outside a room Through the half-open door

white wall Maurizio steps into the room

A MAN watches the footage cigarette in hand The man raises
his hand- “I see you” Maurizio closes the door and leaves

INT REGGIANI HOUSEHOLD KITCHEN- MORNING

Patrizia stands barefoot in the kitchen looking a little
rough last night’s make-up faded on her face She watches
the Bialetti coffee machine as it bubbles away on the stove
Her mother Silvana yanks the coffee off the stove

Patrizia is reading the Corriere della Sera- an Italian daily
newspaper She flips through the pages Suddenly stops
brings the paper closer

Patrizia They’1ll marry you for
your looks Thankfully you got
those from me

PATRIZIA (VO)
Mother never worked a day in her
life so she made it her full-time
job to find me the wrong man

Silvana cuts around the photo of a handsome playboy from a
magazine and places it in a binder There are dozens of other
faces names

PATRIZIA (VO)
She would go through the tabloids
and track every rich bachelor in
town Then she’d get in touch with
their families and I’d be sent off
to check out the next party But
this was different This was my
story I wanted to write it myself

young actor by the name of Maurizio
D’Ancora That would have been me

PATRIZIA
I didn’t know I was sitting with a
movie star Can I get an autograph

Rodolfo swats her compliment away with his hand

RODOLFO
The best thing that came out of my
acting career was meeting
Maurizio’s mother She was a real
star At her funeral during a
moment of silent remembrance
Maurizio saw the priest lighting
candles and started singing happy
birthday He turned the saddest
moment of my life into something

When did you last hug him

but also to overhear Aldo

MAURIZIO
Hello

ALDO GUCCI
(over the phone)
Maurizio How’s my little lawyer

Maurizio’s entire body tenses up as soon as he hears Aldo

MAURIZIO
Fi-fine

ALDO GUCCI
What are you doing this Sunday

MAURIZIO
Um Patrizia’s parents are taking
us to the San Siro for a game

Patrizia’s varnished nails wrap around his chest

ALDO
Really Who’s playing
MAURIZIO
Ah I didn’t ask--
ALDO

I thought the league was on hiatus
for a month

MAURIZIO
Oh I’11 double check--

ALDO
Come to my birthday party I’m only
in town for a couple days

MAURIZIO
Let me discuss it with Patrizia

PATRIZIA
(whispering to Maurizio)
Let’s go A little day trip

ALDO
Your father and I aren’t getting
any younger These gatherings are
becoming a rare occurrence

Patrizia starts kissing Maurizio’s neck Looks at him with
pleading eyes

ALDO (CONTD)
Is that a yes Come on I’1ll be
jumping out of a cake

INT LA RINASCENTE- DAY

Patrizia and Maurizio are in the fragrance section of Milan’s
foremost department store They are in the midst of a
“conversation” that is a little more tense than it should be
She is spraying cologne on various parts of his arm and
seeing which ones she likes best

PATRIZIA
Is Aldo more of a floral type Or
more tobaccocedar

MAURIZIO
Definitely floral

She takes a whiff of Maurizio’s wrist
PATRIZIA
He sounded mortified about not
coming to the wedding
Maurizio lets out a loud laugh
MAURIZIO

Mortified He doesn’t know what
that word means He’s an old dog

PATRIZIA
Don’t be so cynical He’s extending
an olive branch It’s your turn to
open your heart to him Besides
old dogs get softer with age

MAURIZIO
He just gets harder

She turns to the store clerk

PATRIZIA
Well take them all Gift wrapped

EXT LAKE COMO- DAY

Patrizia’s orange FIAT 124 Spider snakes through the idyllic
coastline The lake is surrounded by Alpine peaks and wooded
hills and is one of Italy’s most scenic places

EXT ALDO GUCCI’S LAKE COMO VILLA- DAY

Patrizia and Maurizio walk up-hill to an immense white-and-
turgouise villa perched above the lake carrying Aldo’s
birthday gifts Large umbrellas shield a long table from the
sun as the staff prepare lunch

It is a glorious bucolic vision interrupted by

ALDO (0S)
THATS IT KICK HIS TEETH OUT EARN
YOUR FUCKING LUNCH

Maurizio and Patrizia peer over to the left to a stretch of
LAWN There are goal nets on each end A GAME IS IN PROGRESS

PATRIZIA (VO)
When I met them they were playing a
strange Florentine game It
involved a ball But mostly it
involved beating each other to a

pulp

A group of MEN- some kids too- are playing Calcio Storico -
a game thought up by 16th-century Florentines As the name
suggests its an early and very rough draft of soccer We
join them on the field and see

ALDO White shirt rolled up screaming on the sideline spit
flying out as he motivates his team

THE PLAYERS Still in their once-crisp WHITE SHIRTS and
FLANNEL TROUSERS The shirts bloodied the trousers torn

ALDO
Maurizio We’re missing a player

MAURIZIO
Maybe in a little bit

Patrizia removes his jacket for him takes his glasses off

Maurizio gets on the field steals the ball from an opponent
He looks around at who to pass the only option is PAOLO
GUCCI his cousin

PAOLO GUCCI
Here I’m open

Paolo frantically waves at Maurizio wants the ball But
Maurizio won’t pass it to him

Suddenly Paolo gets ELBOWED IN THE FACE Lands in a mound of
dirt blood squirting out of his nose and onto the ground

Maurizio gets a hold of the ball and SCORES Aldo claps
EXT TERRACE- DAY

Some 20-odd guests sit at the long table under the umbrellas
We pan across the guests as bowls of food are passed around
It’s lively messy energetic

PATRIZIA (VO)
I felt like I was in a bizarre
Renaissance painting First was
Aldo’s son PAOLO

ON PAOLO GUCCI We get a good look at him Uncomfortable in
his own skin Bald mustachioed short He wears a lime-green
corduroy suit Bloody paper up his nostril

PAOLO
(fanning himself)
Is anyone hot I’m drenched I
should have brought a change of
clothes Can men menopause

PATRIZIA (VO)
Paolo was believe it or not
chairman of the Italian Federation
of Pigeon Fanciers Come to think
of it he kind of looked like one

We shift our gaze to Paolo’s buxom British new wife JENNY
She grabs Patrizia’s hand and studies her WEDDING RING

PATRIZIA (VO)

His wife Jenny was an English girl
who had come to Italy to study
Opera Her laugh was a high C It
Made dogs bark ten blocks away

JENNY
Your ring is absolutely divine

PATRIZIA
It was Maurizio’s mother’s

JENNY
He must think you’re very special

Now on ALDO GUCCI A gorgeous young FRENCH MODEL giggling
opposite him as he tickles her toes under the table

PATRIZIA (VO)

Aldo didn’t want women He needed
them He kept Paolo on a tight leash
and the two couldn’t have been more
different As for Maurizio’s father
Rodolfo He didn’t show up He sent
his lawyer instead Domenico De Sole

ON DOMENICO DE SOLE Bookish White socks under a black ill-
fitting business suit Straggly beard He runs his index
finger across his tight shirt collar A nervous tic And he
neatly divides his food into little sections on his plate

Paolo polishes off a glass of wine reaches for another
bottle He’s drunk Jenny changes his wine glass to water

PAOLO
For the record I don’t have a
drinking problem Some people have
a problem with me drinking

ALDO GUCCI

(ignoring him)
You should know Patrizia that the
Guccis were noble saddle-makers to
medieval courts All these
ephemeral trends don’t hold a
candle to our majestic history Our
supple leather The smell of it We
have history flowing through those
green and red webbings And yes we
are expensive But quality is
remembered long after price is
forgotten

e ee FF HF HF HH

Jenny turns to the table Speaks with her mouth full

JENNY
Thoughts on Paolo’s outfit
Domenico You’re the fashionista

DE SOLE
Eccentric

PAOLO
I designed it myself

ALDO GUCCI
Reconsider your wardrobe choices

PAOLO
You don’t understand a thing about
trends father It’s chic

ALDO GUCCI
All I know is that you look like a
Parisian pimp

PAOLO
My father’s problem is that he’s
stuck in the past He refuses to
take Gucci into the next century

ALDO GUCCI
Gucci is doing fine under my watch

PAOLO
It needs new ideas new energy I
am bursting with creativity I’m
like a rush of water

ALDO GUCCI
Somebody build a dam

PAOLO
Lets talk about my future at Gucci

ALDO GUCCI
We’re not here to talk Gucci talk

Aldo examines his slice of Parma prosciutto He calls one of
the waiters over Whispers to him

ALDO GUCCI (CONTD)
Too thick

He stabs at the slice with his fork lifts it up to the sky

PAOLO
When then You’re always brushing
me off I’m a designer I want to
express myself I have flair

ALDO GUCCI
(to the waiter)
If you can’t see the sun through
it it’s not thin enough

PAOLO
I am an artist

ALDO GUCCI
(finally turning to Paolo)
Why all this sudden moaning

PAOLO
I am just sick of being ignored

ALDO GUCCI
(fists on the table)
And I am sick of hearing you talk

PAOLO
It hurts my feelings when you do
this You deliberately hurt my
feelings Let’s go Jenny

Paolo gets up to leave

JENNY
Sit down I haven’t had espresso

Paolo awkwardly sits down again

EXT ALDO GUCCI’S LAKE COMO VILLA- DUSK

INT FIAT 124- NIGHT

Maurizio is driving Patrizia’s orange convertible She is a
little tipsy and he doesn’t drink so he drives

MAURIZIO

Theyve been telling that saddle-
maker story for years It’s all
bullshit We’re not royalty

(beat)
My grandfather was a bellhop in
London That’s where he got the
idea of leather goods By carrying
bags around for rich aristocrats

Sitting in Patrizia’s lap is a box She pries it open
revealing a mud-brown CAKE Not exactly appetizing

PATRIZIA
What is this

MAURIZIO
Castagnaccio It tastes a million
times better than it looks

She breaks off a piece eats it

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
My grandfather Guccio ate it every
day after he became rich because he
couldnt afford it as a kid

PATRIZIA
Hmmm It’s delicious

MAURIZIO
Gucci is like that cake You think
there’s a lot to go around but once
you taste it you’1l want more and
then you’1ll want the whole thing for
yourself

She takes a piece and feeds it to Maurizio
PATRIZIA

And youll just sit and watch them
eat it all

MAURIZIO
I’m Gucci by name I don’t have
their Tuscan character It was
diluted by my ma’s German blood

PATRIZIA
Diluted Or enhanced
She kisses Maurizio
MAURIZIO

What did he whisper in your ear

PATRIZIA
Who

MAURIZIO
Aldo

PATRIZIA
Oh I can’t remember

MAURIZIO

You seemed to really like each other

PATRIZIA
I like everyone

MAURIZIO
I saw him give you something

She suddenly remembers Pulls out the envelope Aldo gave her
PATRIZIA
The only gift we got from the

Guccis Feels like cash

MAURIZIO
It’s probably a coupon

She opens it up Shares it with him They stare surprised
TWO FIRST-CLASS CONCORD TICKETS TO NEW YORK CITY

exclusive street in Milan

Assistants carry several Gucci bags for him Two girlfriends
hang off his arms And ALDO like a drooling Chihuahua chums
around with him Brando steps into the car waving at fans

Aldo helps with the bags slaps the trunk of the car Blows
an air kiss at Brando as the limo drives off He heads back

hand in his pocket Checking out the female clientele

He notices a pretty girl in the SHOE ROOM She wears a
monochrome satin dress and tries a pair of stylish heels in
front of a mirror Only her back (and backside) are visible

ALDO GUCCI
Mademoiselle With all due respect
these heels are not right for you

He gets on his knees slips a different pair on her feet
Studies the reflection in the SHOE MIRROR as she models them

ALDO GUCCI (CONTD)
There Much better
A pair of great Gucci heels are
much more satisfying than a man
They last longer too

He stands up turns her around towards a full mirror And we
reveal in the reflection that IT’S PATRIZIA

PATRIZIA
Hello Uncle

He tries to hide his embarrassment

ALDO GUCCI
My ravishing niece Patrizia I
wasn’t expecting you Lunch at Cova

relieved that we hadn’t met before

He winks Patrizia laughs awkwardly

PATRIZIA
We will have plenty of time to get
to know each other Maurizio is
very fond of you He says you are
the true Gucci in the family The
one who took Guccio’s dream and
turned it into an empire

ALDO GUCCI
Maurizio is a smart young man How
are things with his father

PATRIZIA
Not bad not good

ALDO GUCCI
My brother is a difficult man It’s
time for them to reconcile

Aldo places his hand on hers Nods They get each other

He smiles at a very pretty 20-something year old girl in
overalls and a hair-net She smiles back

ALDO GUCCI
Am I boring you

PATRIZIA
No No We love it

ALDO GUCCI

can’t erase yourself from the
family portrait just because you
enjoy playing with trucks

not’

MAURIZIO
You’ve been a Gucci a few months I
have been a Gucci all my life

PATRIZIA
There are a lot of legacies that

ever been in my life Why change
things

the cheeks (has to get on his tippy toes for Maurizio)

ALDO
How did you sleep

ALDO
Wonderful wonderful That looks
great on you by the way

Patrizia was just playing dress-up

ALDO GUCCI
Here’s a little secret

Aldo grabs one of the gorgeous Sylvie handbags- the classic

model that comes with a top handle- and rubs the LEATHER next

to Patrizia’s ear

ALDO
What do you hear

PATRIZIA
It almost sounds like paper

ALDO
We place a few sheets of newspaper
between the layers of leather to
pad it slightly Italian newspaper
of course The workers swear by it

MAURIZIO
Gucci is full of secrets

ALDO GUCCI
Yes I will share them with you

Patrizia hands the bag back to Aldo who doesn’t take it

mind I want Gucci to remain among

ALDO
Your father and I want the same
thing for you to be a success He

PATRIZIA
What could Maurizio’s title be

Aldo waves his hand spelling words out in thin air

ALDO GUCCI
Gucci World Affairs Coordinator

MAURIZIO
(nervous laughter)
What does that actually mean

Aldo is taken aback by Maurizio’s question- he didn’t think
he’d ask But he leans in and charmingly breaks it down

ALDO GUCCI
Youd be my eyes and ears when I am
away Represent the company when
foreign buyers come into town With
your knowledge of law your
language skills you’d fit right in

Maurizio looks to Patrizia for counsel She smiles Nods

PATRIZIA
We’re flattered and grateful

ALDO
Yes Yes What are you thinking

Much to Patrizia and Aldo’s surprise and disappointment

Paolo Gucci’s Alfa Romeo spider pulls up outside Rodolfo’s
austere mansion Rain pelting it from above He gets out
carrying two large portfolios

INT VILLA NECCHI CAMPIGLIO LIVING ROOM— DAY

Paolo is in the living room neatly arranging his designs on
the large oak table COUGHING is heard down the hallway

The heavy doors swing open RODOLFO enters accompanied by
his trusty lawyer DE SOLE Rodolfo is in a purple silk robe
and sheepskin slippers He finishes drinking a glass of green
juice Wipes his mouth with a Gucci handkerchief MORE BLOOD

PAOLO GUCCI
Hello Uncle You’re looking svelte

They sit in complete silence for a moment Just the sounds of
distant classical music and trickling water from a fountain

RODOLFO
To what do I owe the pleasure of
this visit

Paolo shuffles uncomfortably in his chair DE SOLE’S gaze
remains fixed on him throughout the meeting

PAOLO GUCCI
To say hello

RODOLFO
Hello Anything else

PAOLO GUCCI
Maurizio and my father are spending
a lot of time together in New York
Maybe you and I could do the same

RODOLFO
To discuss what

PAOLO GUCCI
My ideas

RODOLFO
You have ideas

PAOLO GUCCI
I was born with a gift I’m an
artist He just won’t see it

RODOLFO
How come nobody in the family knows
about this gift of yours Domenico
Did you know Paolo had a gift

DE SOLE
I’m afraid I did not sir

PAOLO GUCCI
Let me show you what I’ve been
working on -- Here I’1ll help you

Paolo lifts frail Rodolfo out of his chair and guides him
towards the oak table They review the designs together

PAOLO GUCCI (CONTD)
They were inspired by my trip to
Cuba I call this collection HAVANA
LIBRE Lots of pastels rum-
inspired sun-soaked Lotsa browns

RODOLFO
Pastels and browns together

Both Rodolfo and De Sole marvel at the cacophony of colors
the obvious lack of skill the obliviousness of it all

RODOLFO (CONTD)
Don’t show these to anyone Paolo I
mean it Hide them

PAOLO GUCCI
You think they might steal my
ideas right Get me a lawyer

RODOLFO
I have found over the years that
true talent is often unaware of its

brilliance It must be cherished
and protected Hacks on the other
hand run around shouting their

delusions begging to be

recognized Blind to their own

mediocrity This my dear nephew
is a triumph of mediocrity And you

have achieved the unimaginable you

have found one thing your father

and I agree on Your utter

incompetence

Paolo closes his designs Quietly devastated

PAOLO
You designed that scarf correct

RODOLFO
It caressed the necks of Jackie
Grace Sofia It is my signature

Paolo removes the scarf from Rodolfo’s neck admires it and
in an act of defiance LIGHTS IT ON FIRE with his Zippo It
ignites instantly- FWOOM He dumps it into an ornate urn-
like vase in the corner

Rodolfo stumbles over to it in disbelief trying to put it
out Coughs violently as the smoke rises

PAOLO
I’m going to start my own line

Paolo collects his designs (which takes a lot longer than he
anticipated) and storms out

RODOLFO
Call Maurizio

Maurizio and Patrizia sit quietly opposite him

RODOLFO
Time goes so fast I thought we’d
clear the air Forget about all
that and talk about the future

MAURIZIO
I didn’t know you were sick

RODOLFO
I’m not sick Doctors don’t know
what they’re dealing with They
don’t know how a Gucci is made

PATRIZIA
Tuscan leather is forever

Rodolfo smiles at Patrizia’s quip

RODOLFO
So what have you been up to since
we last met

MAURIZIO
Took some time off Actually we
have some big news to tell you

RODOLFO
(interrupting)
You were in New York with Aldo

e

MAURIZIO
He said he wanted to build bridges
He offered me a job

RODOLFO
You must not trust Aldo He doesn’t
care what Gucci stands for He is
driven by two things money and
ego Everything Guccio worked for
is on the verge of disaster And
that son of a bitch of his Paolo
He’s not even worth the pigeon shit
encrusted on his suits

PATRIZIA
We will fight them with everything
weve got

An intrusion- but Rodolfo appreciates the sentiment

RODOLFO
I would do it myself if I could

PATRIZIA
Who can we trust

RODOLFO
Each other And De Sole since he
does not have a drop of Gucci
blood

Rodolfo has a coughing fit

Patrizia reaches into her purse and places a tiny container
into Rodolfo’s palm Rodolfo opens the container A LOCK OF
HAIR

Like Maurizio’s mother

Rodolfo can’t help but be moved by this revelation

RODOLFO

PATRIZIA
Mine

Rodolfo nods quietly Maybe Patrizia isn’t so bad

e ee e HH

RODOLFO
I have something for you

Rodolfo takes something from his desk - a WALLET Old
wrinkled bearing the two Gucci G’s

RODOLFO (CONTD)
Guccio hand-stitched it himself
had it blessed by the same priest
who baptized you Take it It’s
yours now

Rodolfo hands the wallet to Maurizio

RODOLFO (CONTD)
Remember money was never the goal

Maurizio gets up Rodolfo with great effort rises with him
They square off one last time But now Rodolfo EMBRACES his
son They both WELL UP as Patrizia looks on proudly

ALDO
Business is like marriage you soon
learn to compromise They’re not
fake by the way They’re replicas

PATRIZIA
I was just very very surprised

ALDO GUCCI
You know what else would surprise
you How profitable this stuff is

PATRIZIA
What about quality Your sacred
cows The things you talked about

ALDO GUCCI
Quality is for the rich If a Long
Island housewife wants to live with
the illusion that she’s a Gucci
customer why not let her

PATRIZIA
Because it damages Gucci’s
credibility

ALDO GUCCI
This is us Patrizia
It’s not a girl’s game

MAURIZIO
She’s right It’s junk
(dumps the handkerchief)
This is not what Gucci is

ALDO GUCCI

turned it into an empire Not
Rodolfo and certainly not my son

On the runway the show starts It’s very different from the
fashion shows we are used to Models are all over the place

Maurizio looks at the business card before pocketing it

MAURIZIO
Maybe you will design for me some
day

Walter steps up to Maurizio really pissed off now

WALTER
Here’s some free advice No designer
in this room will work for Gucci
until you’ve all gone into therapy
and worked out your problems Gucci
is a cheap operetta

Walter “accidentally” drops a dollop of cocktail sauce on
Maurizio’s suede moccasin Maurizio looks down Deliberate

MAURIZIO
Thank you for your opinion

DE SOLE
He’s starting a trade war

MAURIZIO

DE SOLE
Maurizio it’s in the paper Our
sales already dropped since the
announcement He’s a liability

PATRIZIA
He’s throwing a grenade

Domenico’s gaze turns to Patrizia He turns back to Maurizio

MAURIZIO
Maybe there’s a way of pulling him
back Rein him in a little

Patrizia isn’t pleased with this answer but she works it

PATRIZIA
What Maurizio is saying is that we
should build a bridge with Paolo
and work things out You know how
emotional he gets He’s dealing
with all this male energy all the
time His wife isn’t exactly the
brightest He needs someone he can
trust and who listens to him

questions one of which youve
already asked

Patrizia looks at him like he’s got two heads

PATRIZIA
What’s with that ring you wear

DE SOLE
It’s from Harvard Law School They

gave me a full scholarship Not bad

for a boy from Calabria

PATRIZIA

Patrizia puts her hand out to study the ring De Sole
reluctantly places it in her palm She studies it

PATRIZIA (CONTD)
I didn’t go to college My brains
are in my gut People who lack a

connection to their gut will always

find themselves in a bad position

De Sole crosses his legs showing off his white socks
Patrizia cringes She hands him the ring back

PATRIZIA (CONTD)
What do you see as being your
purpose at Gucci

DE SOLE
Is this a job interview

PATRIZIA
Maybe

DE SOLE
I’m a conservationist Gucci is a
rare animal It must be protected

PATRIZIA
From who

DE SOLE

such a strong connection to that
which is not yours

see the truth

PAOLO GUCCI
A dinosaur posing as an asshole

PATRIZIA
Maurizio likes you Always has

things together A new chapter

PATRIZIA
Your father took sides when he
asked Maurizio and I to join him in
New York We went We were polite
But we knew where to draw the line
We didn’t want to upset you

PAOLO GUCCI
I appreciate it I kind of feel
picked his nephew over his son

leave him behind You’re justified

Paolo looks up at Patrizia A glint in his eyes

PAOLO GUCCI
I have something on my father

PATRIZIA
Yes

What I have is quite sensitive

PATRIZIA
You don’t have to tell me
I’m just here to support you

It depends on how you play it

She pots the black ball into a hole but Maurizio stops it
from going into the pocket with his hand

at the amount of money being moved

income

Youve been trying to talk to him
all your life Maybe youve been
too nice

loosen his grip on me

Worst case scenario he pays taxes
they slap his wrist Happens all

Paolo who in turns hands it to his new assistant

evasion was in the US Most people

up a decade later without a house
or a car or a pot to piss in

The judge gathers his paperwork

JUDGE
Ten minute recess

A gaggle of NERVOUS MODELS wearing Paolo’s designs make their
way down the catwalk There is NO consistency to the designs

Notre Dame de Lorette

PATRIZIA
Right Maurizio and I stayed there
five years ago We had the most
amazing time I begged Maurizio to
take me for my 25th birthday and of
course he obliged

(puts her hand on his)

Jules Verne restaurant in the

A fire burns in the mahogany imperial bedroom as Patrizia
removes her jewelry and lathers her face in beauty creams
There’s tension in the room You can feel it Maurizio is in
his underwear pulling clothes out of their suitcases

PATRIZIA
What I am trying to tell you is De
Sole is the only person who saw the
unsigned certificates

MAURIZIO
He worked for my father for ten
years He never questioned him I
trust him He’s not the problem

PATRIZIA
He’s not the problem Who is then
I saw how you spoke to me at

MAURIZIO
“Those people” are friends of mine
I’ve known them longer than you

PATRIZIA
He is the problem Say it

MAURIZIO
I’m tired

PATRIZIA
Well wake yourself up and say it

MAURIZIO

When you forge a signature When
you make me sneak around my own
family When you set father and son
against each other me against
Paolo When you second guess a
person like Domenico De Sole- the
ONLY person my father trusted
These things have an effect on the
environment I operate in On me

(beat)
Actions have consequences

PATRIZIA
I was saving us 40 billion lire in
inheritance tax I was being
constructive I’m not going to
apologize for that No thanks

MAURIZIO
My uncle is in prison and my cousin
thinks I’m scum You think that’s
constructive You think that’s
responsible

PATRIZIA
Don’t pin Gucci’s problems on me
I’m just mopping up the mess

MAURIZIO
Inever asked for your help

Patrizia seeing the way this is going changes her attitude

PATRIZIA
Maurizio we’re only strong together

She tries caressing him but he flinches

MAURIZIO
The only thing I need is for you to
stay away from Gucci before you
cause any more damage I can handle
it by myself Is that clear

Patrizia turns on a dime Venom in her eyes

PATRIZIA
Truthfully I’m only getting
involved because you’re an
incompetent little baby idiot
You really are half of Gucci The
shit half A weak little brat

MAURIZIO
You want a real man

He GRABS her by the throat and pushes her up against the
wall lifts her up

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
Maybe youll grow a little-

Patrizia’s feet are a good 5 inches off the ground She claws
at his hands His glasses go flying He snaps out of it

Immediately regretting it he lets go and looks down at his
hands Amazed at himself Color returning to his black eyes

She coughs breathes heavily tears in her eyes

Then unexpectedly- she grabs him and KISSES HIM
PASSIONATELY They do it against the wall it’s aggressive
animalistic A mix of passion and hatred A FINE LINE

PATRIZIA (VO)
So we hit a rough patch Who

Alessandra the importance of not
touching other people’s belongings

Pause Patrizia stares at Paola expecting an answer

PAOLA FRANCHI
A mint when I was a kid
he
I

Paola is silent She knows where this is going

PATRIZIA
I don’t consider myself a
particularly ethical person but I
am fair And I’ve been thinking
Lets assume you are in a museum and
you decide that a certain painting
would look better in your house
and you simply grab the painting
and take it That would be
inexcusable But if you were very
hungry and you had no way of
obtaining money it would be
excusable to steal food ata
market What I cannot wrap my head
around is someone who steals just
for ego or the pleasure of it For
personal satisfaction It is at
that point that I subscribe to
unconventional punishments

Paola clamps her ski boots
PAOLA FRANCHI
I’1l have my maid drop off the
Strudel later Good to see you

DE SOLE
Investcorp They’re owned by Nemir
Kirdar Iraqi powerhouse They like
high-end retail investments Bought
Tiffanys in 84 Turned it around
quick

MAURIZIO
Why them though Why not Dought
Hanson Or Hellman and Friedman

DE SOLE
Too obvious We need someone with
capital who doesn’t have any ties
to the family Paolo and Aldo would
only sell to a complete stranger

2 INT ST MORITZ CHALET PRIVATE STUDY- DAY

A long pause Maurizio thinks carefully

MAURIZIO
Plant the seed with them
Ill be back soon

DE SOLE
(over the phone)
I don’t think coming back is a good
idea especially with the ongoing
investigation into the forgery

MAURIZIO
(cutting him off)
Did I ask you for your opinion

Maurizio has NEVER snapped at him before We just hear De
Sole’s muffled breathing over the line Both are shocked

he

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
I’1ll pay the inheritance tax I’1l
take the hit When all is said and
done 40 billion lire will look a
lot like a drop in the sea

DE SOLE
Maurizio “taking the hit” isn’t
that straightforward There’d be a
trial prison penalties and
further payment of tax plus
interest There’d be nothing left

De Sole has a really good brain and Maurizio knows it

MAURIZIO
What do you suggest

DE SOLE
Youll need a very solid legal
strategy It needs to be dragged
out as slowly as possible Once the
company’s profile is restored the
authorities are much more likely to
forgive you

MAURIZIO
(satisfied with the answer)
Youre right Now I understand why
my father trusted you so much

I want a partner who can buy out
the half of Gucci that’s giving me
a headache The half that’s
preventing Gucci from being great--

KIRDAR
-- The half that belongs to your
Uncle and your Cousin

MAURIZIO
Investcorp has had great success
with Tiffany A resurrection

KIRDAR
True But Tiffany isn’t Gucci
Gucci is a family business And
that means family problems

MAURIZIO
I take one step forward they make
me take three steps backwards

KIRDAR
A name like yours needs prestige

MAURIZIO
Exactly Instead-

Maurizio struggles to find his next words Kirdar sees this
and is intrigued

KIRDAR
Continue It’s important to know
these things

The two men move to the bar Kirdar prepares drinks a Scotch
for himself a Pepsi for Maurizio Knows he doesn’t drink

MAURIZIO
Aldo is convinced he is God’s gift
to the fashion world His son Paolo
is a complete liability whose most
significant achievement in life was
to put his father in jail

KIRDAR
Families are strengths and
weaknesses

MAURIZIO
There is a saying in Italy the
first generation is the one that
creates the idea the second
develops it the third must face
the big growth questions

KIRDAR
(cryptic- maybe doubtful)
There will be no growth where there
are weeds Your garden is overrun
he
No
tony

MAURIZIO
I often ask myself how many
competing labels have been born and
reached success just because Gucci
was standing still Now is the time
to turn the page Gucci is like a
Ferrari that we are driving like a
Fiat It is underexploited and
mismanaged With the right partner
we can bring it back to what it
used to be We have one more chance
to recover the Gucci customer and
that is to provide him with
product service consistency and
image Once it was a privilege to
own a Gucci bag and it can be
again We need one vision one
direction and the money will flow
as you’ve never seen it

Kirdar is speechless He doesn’t show it but he is clearly
seduced by Maurizio’s arguments passion and energy

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
I brought you something

De Sole perfectly cued loosens the duffel bag Removes an
intricate shoebox Ceremoniously places it on the table

Maurizio opens the box revealing

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
Burgundy Size 10 US Wide

Kirdar takes the shoe and looks like a pig in shit

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
This model is a permanent fixture
at the Metropolitan Museum in New
York You can’t buy it anywhere
(beat)
And now it is yours

Kirdar smells the shoes closes his eyes as he slips them on

KIRDAR
Show me those numbers

doing the dishes Paolo fidgets anxiously “helps” Aldo tidy
up- knocks a stack of plates over

ALDO
Well I’m here now Things will go
back to the way they were

Paolo’s shaking hand extends the INTERCORP PROPOSAL LETTER to
Aldo who keeps scrubbing and glances over at it
dismissively

And you’re my idiot

We pull back as Aldo stares painfully at the wall

KIRDAR and his two
folders forward They

For your review Mr Gucci We hope
youll find this offer appealing

ALDO

Id rather not read my own obituary

KIRDAR
I can assure you no-one is a
greater admirer of Gucci than
myself To finally sit with a

member of the dynasty is something
I will cherish forever And truly

I understand how difficult-
Aldo interrupts him

ALDO
Don’t patronize me with this

nonsense It offends me And it

wastes both of our time

The Iraqi execs look at each other They’re not used to their

boss being spoken to this way

ALDO (CONTD)
Why are you here

KIRDAR

I don’t understand your question

ALDO
What were you born to do

KIRDAR

My family is in oil But my love

has always been fashion Bold

fashion Nothing makes me smile
more than when I see someone being
fully themselves with their own
individual style and character

whatever that is

ALDO
(disdainfully)
So you’re an oil man

KIRDAR
(proudly)
I turned Tiffany around

ALDO

Tiffany Tiffany sells trinkets
They’re not an empire like we are

(beat)
When I was born the first thing my
father Guccio did- before feeding
me or washing me or baptizing me-
the first thing he did was place a
piece of Tuscan leather under my
nose He said “Aldo take a deep
breath This is your future” I
didn’t have a choice I didn’t
question it I did the best that I
could to ensure that he would be
proud Unfortunately some
delusional people around me did
everything they could to stop me

Paolo looks down Mortified

KIRDAR
Mr Gucci I have a plane to catch
in an hour If you have a problem
with the offer Said and Omar can-

PAOLO
(trying to ease tensions)
We’re very grateful for your offer-

Aldo throws shade at Paolo Then looks back at Kirdar
Suddenly something catches Aldo’s gaze Kirdar’s moccasins

ALDO
May I see your shoe

Patiently Kirdar removes one of the moccasins from his foot
Aldo takes it from him and holds it It is burgundy supple

ALDO (CONTD)
One of my favorite pieces The
Leather Penny Loafer I haven’t
seen burgundy ones in years

Suddenly a KNOCK Maurizio moves towards it excitedly
ALDO and PAOLO
They make their way inside Not a word is spoken

Aldo removes the shares documents from his briefcase and
holds them up

Before Maurizio has a chance to speak Aldo SLAPS his nephew
across the face It’s the closest thing to getting punched
he’1l ever come to His glasses go FLYING across the room

Next very deliberately Aldo SITS down at Maurizio’s desk
BRUSHES a ton of stuff aside with his Gucci cane UNSCREWS
his Mont Blanc fountain pen

And SIGNS his Gucci shares away His gaze planted onto
Maurizio Essentially cutting his veins in front of him

ALDO
Congratulations You are now the
majority shareholder of Gucci

Aldo puts his hat on Grabs his cane Slips his arm into

and unconventional styling touches
Loafers sans socks I see pole
dancers flanking the runways
Female and Male of course

wants to understand but is out of his depth

TOM FORD (CONTD)
I want Gucci to be sexy

from Patrizia and Maurizio’s Navigli tryst many years ago
Except now it is dark and mysterious Ominous

ON PATRIZIA She stands across the street in her mink coat
shivering Waiting Suddenly the RUMBLE of a sports car

A FERRARI F40 (15 Million) pulls up outside the building

The door opens MAURIZIO steps out Alone
ON PATRIZIA She walks across the street Slowly then faster
He sees it’s Patrizia Hurries towards his apartment quickly -
There is something unnerving about her
PATRIZIA

Maurizio turns around deeply disturbed at being stalked

MAURIZIO
I don’t want a confrontation

PATRIZIA
Me neither I tried calling

MAURIZIO

PATRIZIA
To talk

Patrizia is clutching something under her arm We don’t know

She starts flipping through photos holding them up to him
Memories Carefully arranged in order Maurizio is fazed

PATRIZIA (CONTD)

MAURIZIO
(pissed off quietly)
Is this an ambush Are you here to
humiliate yourself with this
fucking charade If so you are
succeeding

Not the answer she was hoping for He makes for the steps

PATRIZIA
Why are you speaking to me this way

MAURIZIO
Because I don’t know what you want
from me A story has a beginning
and an end Ours ended a few
chapters ago Why are you here

PATRIZIA
To have you to myself I love you

In a rare moment of affection (however cruel) Maurizio
removes his gloves and places his hands on Patrizia’s
devastated face

MAURIZIO
Look at me

She looks up A wounded tiger

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
Listen to me I don’t love you I
don’t hate you I just don’t want to
spend the rest of my life with you

Realizing what the effect his words are having

He turns his back makes his way up the marbled steps greets
the Porter and leaves Patrizia in a state of total despair
But before he goes one last arrow straight to her heart

Patrizia stumbles back onto the street which is now EVEN
FOGGIER She wipes tears from her eyes struggles to see

MOS except for music swelling

two plastic chairs The sound of sex echoes from a room

Two men hesitantly walk outside One is lean elegant
youngish This is BENEDETTO (30s) The other man is somewhat
older and glum This is IVANO (50s)

Patrizia gives the two men the slightest nod They make their
way and sit down at the table Patrizia checks her watch

PATRIZIA
Are you usually punctual

IVANO
Almost always

PATRIZIA
Then why are you late We said 3pm

IVANO
We got lost All the one-way
streets messed us up

PATRIZIA
I don’t tolerate lateness

PINA AURIEMMA
I told Patrizia I’ve known you
since childhood We trust you

IVANO
It won’t happen again
I’m Ivano Savioni This is my
associate Benedetto Ceraulo

Ivano extends his hand Patrizia looks at it perplexed
offers him half an inch of her leather-gloved hand

PATRIZIA
Who does what

IVANO
(pointing to Benedetto)
He’s Sicilian

Question answered Benedetto wrestles with the Espresso
vending machine hits it tries to get it going

PATRIZIA
How soon can you do it

IVANO
As soon as we know his routine
security and we agree on our rate
Benedetto gestures with his fingers Four and three Zeros
PATRIZIA
Someone else quoted me far less for

this job Two is all I can do

Pina shifts uncomfortably in her seat
he
je)

IVANO
Well it’s a rush job And you will
have to provide photographs for us
We don’t want to make any mistakes

PATRIZIA
Two is all I’m willing to pay It’s
not worth more I’1l pay you half
now half when it’s done
Ivano looks at Benedetto who gives him a sign “Ok”

Patrizia slides the duffel bag over and leaves with Pina

PATRIZIA (CONTD)
We will be in touch

INT PALAZZO SERBELLONI RUNWAY- NIGHT

RED AND GREEN VELVET fills the frame Projected onto it the
word GUCCI The crowd’s murmur fades as the show begins

Massive Attack’s BLUE LINES kicks in Its pulsating rhythm
dangerous modern seductive

Parading down a spotlighted smokey runway like an
otherworldly apparition is a stone-faced 90s SUPERMODEL She
is dressed in one of Tom Ford’s seventies-tinged designs
signaling a sexy super-glam new direction

Soon she is joined by a gaggle of MODELS
ON THE AUDIENCE no way of knowing if they’re impressed yet
Just surprised A FASHIONISTA wearing white-rimmed glasses

turns to her colleague

FASHIONISTA
Are you sure this is a Gucci show

More models step out onto the runway This time MEN

Jewel-tone satin shirts Velvet hip-huggers Horse bit
leather loafers with the race car finish And the SHOCKER

A male model turns around to expose his bare ass in chaps
BACKSTAGE LATER

We glide through COMPLETE CHAOS Half-naked MODELS running
around DRESSERS helping models get into outfits The show’s

DIRECTOR screaming into a walkie-talkie The LIGHTING
TECHNICIAN at the mixing board fading lights inout

And we land on TOM FORD pacing nervously and quickly
pulling on a model’s blazer before sending him out onto the
runway DE SOLE next to him watching the audience from the
sidelines And KIRDAR whose gaze is firmly fixed on the
dozens of half-naked girls surrounding him Happy as a clam

In a corner looking like a deer in headlights is MAURIZIO
A couple of people move him around He’s IN THE WAY

The show director gestures to Tom Ford Signals him 321

Tom Ford steps onto the runway to RAUCOUS APPLAUSE Standing
ovations A bouquet of flowers handed to him

A FASHION SUPERSTAR IS BORN

De Sole and Kirdar EMBRACE both men delighted with the
reception the show is getting Maurizio awkwardly walks
through the hugging kissing crying crew

WE TRACK THROUGH THE AUDIENCE to find

PATRIZIA The only person whose gaze is NOT directed at Tom
Ford But rather at Maurizio in the wings Venom in her eyes

POV MAURIZO He sees her But as people rise and clap she
vanishes wiped away by a passing silhouette

BACKSTAGE Tom Ford has a magnum of CHAMPAGNE poured all over
himself by a couple models He opens his mouth as they pour
some directly in it He steals the bottle and SPRAYS his
assistants dressers designers A victory lap

DE SOLE hangs back watching his protegé run amok for a few
moments MAURIZIO is next to him

He is MOVED TO TEARS Puts a hand on Domenico’s shoulder
MAURIZIO
This is what Gucci is supposed to

be This is the future

DE SOLE
Extraordinary

MAURIZIO
Hiring Tom Ford was the greatest
decision I’ve ever made My father
would be so proud
De Sole bites his tongue “His” decision to hire Tom Ford

From across the wings KIRDAR catches De Sole’s eye “Do it”

DE SOLE
Kirdar wants to meet with you

MAURIZIO
I would love that Dinner Monday

DE SOLE
He’s only available for lunch
tomorrow He booked Boeucc

MAURIZIO
Tomorrow Tomorrow is Sunday

DE SOLE
He said it’s urgent

MAURIZIO
Let’s bring him a couple of Jackie
crocodile bags Can you arrange it

DE SOLE
No need Your presence is enough

Maurizio studies De Sole who looks down after a moment He
knows he’s been betrayed

MAURIZIO
Okay sure Whatever works

De Sole leaves Maurizio and he disappears into the crowd

EXT PIAZZA BELGIOIOSO-— DAY

The SUNDAY BELLS ring at a nearby church Maurizio walks
across the cobblestones of the 17th century piazza looking
like a man on his way to the hanging tree

He arrives at the ANCIENT DOORS leading into Boeucc the
oldest restaurant in town They open like a lion’s mouth

INT ANTICO RISTORANTE BOEUCC-— DAY

Vaulted ceilings linen tablecloths silver cutlery crystal
glasses The essence of the late XIX century It is still
early and most Milanese are at Sunday Mass So it is
virtually empty Except for

TOM FORD KIRDAR DE SOLE OMAR SAID They are LISTENING as
De Sole reads from a review in Sunday’s New York Times Tom
is still wearing last night’s clothes He’s hungover and
definitely reeks of champagne

DE SOLE
(reading)
When Tom Ford took over the
creative reins of Gucci in 1994
there was little hope for the
Milanese fashion house

Tom Ford goes quiet and puts a hand on his mouth as though to
say “am I dreaming”

TOM FORD

(reading)
It took a German designer to stir
up Chanel and it is an American
who has put Gucci far and away in
the front of fashion Some say Mr
Ford will give Mr Lagerfeld a run
for his money

Tom Ford looks up at De Sole Tears streaming down his face

TOM FORD (CONTD)
I have to call my mother in Austin

Tom gets up and rushes out just as Maurizio enters A very
different mood welcomes Maurizio at the table

KIRDAR
Maurizio please Sit down

Maurizio sits on one end of the table- facing the other four
men The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the
table They watch him silently as he uncorks and pours it

A SECOND WAITER lays out a couple plates of “antipasti”

MAURIZIO
What an unforgettable night

KIRDAR
Indeed Have some carpaccio
Maurizio It melts in your mouth

Maurizio serves himself passes the plate around Kirdar
Omar and Said are SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER IN ARABIC No idea
what is being said Maurizio looks at De Sole for clues

KIRDAR (CONTD)
I feel like we can speak honestly
here at this table We are among
friends We all respect each other

Maurizio presses his glasses into his face Sweating bullets

KIRDAR (CONTD)
We are very concerned

MAURIZIO
What concerns you

KIRDAR
Numbers Specifically Guccis

MAURIZIO
You said you didn’t care about
numbers You trusted your instinct

KIRDAR
I only care about numbers when
they’re terrible

Omar places a FINANCIAL SUMMARY in front of Maurizio A list
of his recklessness Maurizio thumbs through it

KIRDAR (CONTD)
Our projections for 1996 are
abysmal By slashing hundreds of
profitable items and --

MAURIZIO
You mean my Uncle’s knick knacks

DE SOLE
They are insignificant It’s your
personal expenses All paid for
through Gucci’s accounts and
charged as expenses

MAURIZIO
I am Gucci They’re my expenses to
function

KIRDAR
The multi-million dollar antiques
in the stores The purchase of
countless cars including a Ferrari
F40 and a Lamborghini Countach

MAURIZIO
Appearances matter

KIRDAR
Your watch- a Patek Philippe 2523

Worth 3 million Maurizio pulls his sleeve over it

MAURIZIO
I like to be on time

KIRDAR
A seven million dollar penthouse I
could go on and on investments
in a Casino in Macau a palatial

18th century villa outside Florence
for use as a training center

MAURIZIO
I was going to tell you about that
today Great opportunity

Kirdar nods at Said who removes a notebook He reads out of
it for maximum accuracy

SAID

Losses are likely to total 30
million this year on sales of 180
million down from 210 million in
1991 and 270 million in 1990
There is 85 million in bank debt
We may even have trouble paying
salaries in the next couple of
months Profits remain elusive

MAURIZIO
I always said that our strategic
plan would take five years It’s
not about immediate profit
(motions with his hand)
You go down to come back up again
That’s how you get out of a stall

KIRDAR
We’re going to crash and burn Today
MUST be a new chapter Maurizio

MAURIZIO
(dawns on him)
A new chapter
(leans in)
Twelve months Give me twelve
months Please

KIRDAR
The last twelve months have told us
everything we need to know

MAURIZIO
Six months I can turn it around

KIRDAR
Youre a yachtsman who sails a
three-masted ship

(MORE )

KIRDAR (CONTD)
You seem to have forgotten what any
mariner ought to know when storm
winds blow trim the sails

Kirdar turns to the silent party at the table De Sole

De Sole is ICE COLD He wipes his mouth and slowly
deliberately makes it clear whose side he’s on

DE SOLE
We want to offer you 150 million
for your 50 stake in Gucci

MAURIZIO
You want me out

DE SOLE
We want to save the company

This was always the direction in which the meeting was
headed But to hear it said by De Sole- possibly Maurizio’s
closest oldest ally- burns like hell

MAURIZIO
Who’s going to be appointed CEO

All eyes on De Sole Nothing more needs to be said
Maurizio recalls Patrizia’s distrust of De Sole

MAURIZIO (CONTD)
She was right about you

KIRDAR
It’s the only way 150 million
You’ll be a rich man

MAURIZIO
If you really think this is about
money then you know less about
Gucci than I thought

He extends a MONT-BLANC PEN The same model Aldo used to sell
his soul to Maurizio previously What goes around

The golden tip of the pen black ink like a poisoned dart
Maurizio stares at it If he signs it will be the end of
Gucci and the beginning of a new era Without him

DE SOLE
(gently)
Please try and take this in the
spirit of our friendship You have
so many qualities Maurizio

DE SOLE (CONTD)
But let’s be realistic Not everyone
is a natural manager We have been
through a lot together But I feel I
have to tell you I don’t think you
know how to manage this company

As Maurizio contemplates this monumental decision SAID AND
OMAR taste the carpaccio savoring its tenderness They speak
Arabic to each other then turn to the waiter

SAID
This meat Where is it from

The waiter proudly announces to the table
WAITER
This is the finest beef in Tuscany
It comes from the Val Di Chiana
The cows are treated like royalty

Maurizio looks at the carpaccio on his plate It’s from the
same cows used to make Gucci leather

Suddenly abruptly Maurizio SLAMS his fist on the pristine
table cloth

MAURIZIO
NO NO NO NO NO

EXT PIAZZA BELGIOIOSO- DAY
Maurizio stumbles out of the meeting like a featherweight
that just went fifty rounds with a wrecking ball Completely

stunned Drained of color His hubris reduced to rubble

He sits on a bench in the middle of the square staring at
pigeons picking at breadcrumbs (and each other) He is ALONE

TITLE UP Monday March 27 1995 759am

EXT MAURIZIO’S CORSO VENEZIA APARTMENT-— DAY

We are outside Maurizio’s new apartment The city is slowly
waking up on Monday morning A posse of students with their
backpacks spill into a bus on the corner

Parked on the other side of the front door is an unremarkable

AN ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF Patrizia’s Also signaling 800am

Patrizia is fully submerged in a bath She’s underwater for
what seems like an eternity

Finally she comes up for air She is not wearing her wig
She wraps a robe around herself and leaves the bathroom

INT CAFE BRUNO- DAY (INTERCUT)

Elegant as usual Maurizio sits at the bar lost in thought
Mistakes Regrets A lost legacy He can’t shake it off He
wears the shadow of Gucci

A waiter places an espresso and a brioche next to him

Angle on the pair of DOUBLE G GUCCI CUFFLINKS We recognize
them from the opening

INT PINA’S PARLOR- DAY (INTERCUT

Patrizia and Pina are in pitch black Curtains drawn lit
only by Pina’s candles A series of CARDS laid out on the
table All depicting female saints

EXT VIA PALESTRO (INTERCUT

Maurizio emerges from Cafe Bruno and walks briskly along the
sidewalk avoiding the road

As Maurizio approaches the building a man who was following
calls out --

IVANO
Signor Gucci

Maurizio turns around Squints Presses his glasses into his
nose to better see One final time

Benedetto fumbles with the gun Cocks it And FIRES
BLAM One bullet enters at the HIP Maurizio SPINS
BLAM The second at the left SHOULDER

Maurizio slumps to the sidewalk Blood leaking out of him

Maurizio crawls up the steps Benedetto comes to stand over
him He fires a fourth into Maurizios right temple

THE PORTER steps outside of the vestibule holding a broom
Benedetto aims the gun towards the Porter and fires two more

shots one of which hits the Porter in the shoulder He
slides down the wall to the ground

Benedetto runs back down the steps and gets in the Clio
which takes off at speed along the avenue

INT PINA’S PARLOR- DAY

Patrizia goes to light her cigarette with a candle It
FLICKERS eerily She throws a glance at Pina Even she looks
genuinely spooked Interrupted by

The two women exchange glances

While Paola is in the living room discussing the legalities

Maurizio’s old closet She goes through his suits his coats
Finds a big beige raincoat

She removes it from the rack wraps it around herself and
slumps in the chair Taking big deep breaths into it

Alessandra walks into the room

The look of a woman who has done the unthinkable

Patrizia does not look up and we PIVOT around her We see the
Italian justice hall alive with lawyers witnesses
journalists

Patrizia looks over at PINA who looks like she hasn’t slept
