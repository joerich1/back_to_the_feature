Two fourteenyear-old girls JANICE HENDERSON (AMY
POEHLER) and LEE ANN WHITLEY (ISLA FISHER) are hanging
out in the back seat of a mini-van They sport braces
acne giant perms and Credo concert shirts

JANICE
Okay so I’1ll be walking through a
field probably picking daisies And
I’1ll hear the sound of hooves

LEE ANN
It’s got to be a white horse

JANICE
I was getting to that It’s a white
horse With a braided tail with a ribbon
in it

LEE ANN
What color ribbon

JANICE
Blue Something kind of masculine And
I’11 look up And it’s Gunnar Trinidad
Topless And he‘1ll swoop me up in his
arms and put me on the back of the horse

REVEAL Janice’s father MR HENDERSON is driving the
mini-van

MR HENDERSON
What kind of saddle

JANICE
Dad

Lee Ann is super embarrassed for Janice

saddle and rock and roll star would-

Mr Henderson swigs a beer

JANICE

spectacle DIEGO the drummer rises out of the stage
The crowd goes crazy The drumming starts

LEE ANN (CONTD)
(overjoyed)
I really might puke

JANICE
Me too

Diego is joined by WAYNE (WILL ARNETT) the bass player
who also rises from the stage We hear the high pitched
whine of a lead guitar as RICK rises from the stage The
-audience is in a frenzy The lights go down A lone
spotlight shines as GUNNAR TRINIDAD Credo’s lead singer
is slowly lowered from the ceiling His long hair
shimmers Gunnar is gorgeous young full of life

Think Bon Jovi during his “Blaze of Glory” days

JANICELEE ANN
(mouthed worshipful)
I love you Gunnar

Gunnar starts singing his hit song “Rock Justice” Lee
Ann and Janice know every word by heart

GUNNAR

(singing)
You take me to court and you sue my
style But you’ve got to know that I make
the jury smile With my cool leather
pants and long long hair You want to be
me but you’re just too square And the
judge is dishing out Rock justice
Rock justice

Lee Ann and Janice flash their training bras at Gunnar

They arrive just in time The lights come up and a
dramatic guitar solo begins The girls start screaming
A GIANT CONFEDERATE FLAG the size of the stage is
unfurled Suddenly Gunnar appears Gunnar is still
quite sexy but he definitely looks less spirited and
less healthy Gunnar lights the flag on FIRE

GUNNAR
Freedom

Lee Ann and Janice go crazy They yell over the noise

JANICE
He’s not wearing the sweater we made him

LEE ANN
Well it is kind of warm in here

Lee Ann points to the skanked out groupies hanging out in
the wings They sexily throb to the music

JANICE
Oh my God That’s hand job Hannah

REVEAL that a GIANT-BOOBED WOMAN is standing right behind
Janice flashing her ENORMOUS KNOCKERS Gunnar is staring
past Janice right at the woman’s mind-blowing breasts

JANICE
Maybe tonight’s finally the night

EXT BACKSTAGE DOOR NIGHT

It’s after the concert Janice and Lee Ann are now
wearing black t-shirts beat up jeans and caps They
look as much like roadies as two petite girls could Lee
Ann shows Janice two very poorly doctored backstage
passes

JANICE
Wow These look awesome

LEE ANN
I made them on the school’s laminating
machine

JANICE
You are so crafty

LEE ANN
Thank you

Lee Ann and Janice put on their passes and get into the
security screening line They approach the MASSIVE
BACKSTAGE GUARD SNAKE Their petiteness is even more
magnified as we realize how truly massive this guy is

JANICE
Be cool

Janice and Lee Ann throw their metal belongings
including LEE ANN’S PHONE into the bowl and start to walk
through the detector

SNAKE
Passes please

Janice and Lee Ann flash their passes way too quickly

SNAKE (CONTD)
Can I see those again ladies

JANICE
(in a dyke-y voice)
Oh we’re not ladies We’re roadies We
have to move some speakers

LEE ANN
Yeah we have to carry microphones to a
truck and wrap cords around our arms and
other stuff that we roadies normally do

Snake closely examines their passes

SNAKE

You misspelled backstage
LEE ANN

Did I
SNAKE

backstage but you have to give me a
little sumpin’ sumpin’

JANICE

SNAKE
A little oral love in that bus over
there

LEE ANN
Yes sir

Lee Ann determinedly marches toward the bus
JANICE
Lee Ann No Are you crazy You can’t
be giving roadie head left and right

LEE ANN
I thought he meant talking dirty

JANICE
Are you kidding Oral love means oral
SEX Gunnar’s not going to want your
tainted mouth around his wiener if it’s
been around some roadie’s Gunnar’s a
class act

LEE ANN
Janice you’re so right
(to Snake)
I’m sorry sir But I have dignity and
I will not put my mouth around your
wiener But I sincerely thank you for

the offer

SNAKE
Get out of here And take your friend
with you

Snake pulls Janice out of the line He shoves Lee Anns
bowl with her metal belongings into her chest Lee Ann
is forced backward and bumps into a tall slutty Cubana
ANTIGUA and her equally skanky friend JADE who are
exiting the building Lee Ann knocks ANTIGUA’S PHONE out
of her hand and SPILLS her own bowl Quickly Lee Ann
picks up her stuff

ANTIGUA

(super bitch)
Watch out
LEE ANN
Sorry

Lee Ann grabs what she thinks is her phone while Antigua
grabs Lee Ann’s phone They each walk away with the
WRONG PHONE

INT LA SIESTA VAN - LATER
The girls are driving home eating Slim Jims

LEE ANN
I’m so glad you were there Janice I
almost ruined everything I’ve been
saving myself for Gunnar for years

JANICE
We both have

14

LEE ANN
I mean I’m no virgin but I am saving a
couple of holes for him

JANICE
And those are the holes that matter
Like I’ve said all along Lee Ann
becoming a groupie takes patience Do
you think Hannah got a song written about
her because she gave hand jobs to every
Tom Dick and Harry that came along

LEE ANN
Yes

JANICE
No She did not She saved that magical
palm of hers for people that mattered
The members of Credo

LEE ANN
You’re right If I’ve waited this long
for Gunnar Trinidad I can wait a little
longer

JANICE
It‘s going to be so worth it Trust me
he’1ll fall in love with us the second he
finally meets us

LEE ANN
And then we’ll be groupies for life
right

JANICE

Exactly Well get out of Hicksville
forever Well get to see the world Or
at least North America

LEE ANN
And we’ll get to give lots of oral sex
right

JANICE

Tons of it

Lee Ann claps with glee

There’s piss on the floor

INT ST DAVID’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Lee Ann stands in front of her fourth grade classroom

LEE ANN
And like the parable of the burning bush
when Gunnar Trinidad rose from the floor
I had to turn my eyes away because I
could not look directly at the face of
God

The fourth graders stare at Lee Ann in awe One young
girl ROBYN raises her hand

ROBYN
Miss Whitley

LEE ANN
Yes Robyn

ROBYN
Did Mr Trinidad sing Hilarys Hot Boo-
na-na”

LEE ANN
Yes he did And it was like the sweet
voice of the Angel Gabriel Only with a
soul patch

SISTER RANKA (0C)

LEE ANN
(a little flustered)
Sister Ranka We were just discussing
The Apostles’ Creed

SISTER RANKA

LEE ANN
Okay kids Let’s hear it

CHILDREN
I believe in the God the Creator

rambling fades out A lone voice can still be heard

CHILD 1
-boo-na-na

SISTER RANKA
Miss Whitley In the hall Immediately
INT ST DAVID’S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

job

LEE ANN
Yes Sister Ranka

SISTER RANKA
50 Hail Marys And hold out your hands

Lee Ann holds out her hands Sister Ranka raps her on
the hands with a ruler Lee Ann winces

INT LEE ANN AND JANICE’S APARTMENT - LATER

It’s a sterile characterless apartment beige carpet
Venetian blinds white walls and cheap Ikea furniture
The only thing that sets it apart is that every square
inch is covered with Credo memorabilia from posters to
signed t-shirts to framed concert stubs

The CREDO FAN CLUB is meeting Lee Ann sets down the
bowl of Chili Con Queso in front of the other fan club
members KYLE and RYAN two overweight 18 year old boys
who are extremely effeminate and possibly in love
Doris from La Siesta who is trying to stay awake in the
corner There is a scary old Harley driver IZZY A
homeless-—ish looking woman ROSE sits in the corner

LEE ANN
Thank you all for coming As the co-
president of the local chapter of the
Credo Fan Club I am pleased to bring you
the actual recipe for Gunnar Trinidad’s
fourth favorite food Chili Con Queso

The fan club members are in awe

KYLE
OMG

LEE ANN
And his favorite way to eat it is on
Tostitos brand tortilla chips

She presents a bag of Tostitos She opens it like it is
the food of the Gods Everyone reaches in tries the dip

RYAN
I wish I were like Chili con Queso Then
I could be in Gunnar’s mouth

Kyle and Ryan exchange a loving glance

LEE ANN
Wed also like to welcome back Rose
tonight who finally finished serving her
sentence for animal hoarding

Rose waves She then eyes Gunnar Trinicat The cat
recoils and runs out of the room

IZZY
I did a little time in the 70s That’s
where I discovered God

KYLE

Oh You should come to my bible study
RYAN

It’s really wonderful I go all the

time
Kyle and Ryan smile lovingly at each other

IZZY
No thanks I did some time in the 80s
and I undiscovered God and discovered
Credo

JANICE
Guys as you know we attended yet
another Credo concert last night

KYLE
I am so jealous

RYAN
I was gonna go but my Dad made me watch
stupid Monday Night Football with him

KYLE

RYAN
Tell me about it

Kyle and Ryan look at each other for a little too long

JANICE
Well don’t worry because I’ve written a
special song inspired by our evening last
night

IZZY
That’s very thoughtful

JANICE
Really it was nothing Right now I’11
Just play the power chords but I do plan
on adding some picking later Lee Ann is
going to accompany me on the autoharp

LEE ANN
I’m just going to play D7 the whole time
okay

JANICE
Perfect

(singing too emotionally)
Miracles come in special packagesAll
wrapped up in leather and hair you don’t
know when you’re going to come face to
face with an angel but last night I saw
heaven I was there

Lee Ann strums passionately The fan club members are
really into it Ryan starts crying a little Kyle
reaches out to hold his hand to comfort him
2l

JANICE (CONTD)
(really feeling it)
Gunnar’s sweat was like holy water
Rick’s guitar sounded like a dream
Diego brought the rhythm of my heart to
life or at least that’s how it seemed
(speak-singing)
It’s true I witnessed a miracle The
Miracle was you Credo

The fan club members burst into applause

ROSE
You should seriously become a
professional musician

JANICE
Thank you

IZZY
That’s some of the best music I’ve ever
heard And I’ve heard a lot I used to
drive truck Nothing to do all day but
listen to music Occasionally I’d beat
up a hooker but other than that I’d just
listen to music

JANICE

Thanks That is really sweet
DORIS

Bedpan
JANICE

The girls shove the fan club members out the door Doris
gathers up the trash bag and wraps it around her

INT LEE ANN AND JANICE’S APARTMENT - LATER

Janice is entranced by the phone She watches it with a
look that is part horror part delight

LEE ANN
It belongs to that girl I bumped into

JANICE
Which one

Lee Ann looks at the phone

LEE ANN
I think she’s the one on top of Gunnar
No wait on bottom Now she’s in front
of him Now behind him

JANICE
This is disgusting Sex with two
women at the same time

LEE ANN
I cant believe Gunnar would do that

JANICE
Well he must have been forced

LEE ANN
Yeah These women are probably trying to
exploit him

JANICE
They probably drugged him and forced him
to do these unspeakable acts

LEE ANN
They must have What man would want to
do this

JANICE

whores were taping him

LEE ANN
We have to call the police

it And they’ll talk Cops talk Trust
me pigs talk Gunnar’s reputation will
be ruined

LEE ANN
Well we should destroy it Give it to
me Ill eat it

JANICE

you cancer

LEE ANN
Well we have to do something

JANICE
We should warn Gunnar There are people
out there trying to ruin his reputation
and we have to let him know about it

LEE ANN
You’re right He’s a hero If this gets
out there I can’t believe what it would
do to my students at St David’s
learning that their hero had pre-marital
sex

JANICE
Or the residents at La Siesta They
would just die if they knew he was doing
it with two different women at the same at
time he

LEE ANN
Let’s deliver this directly to him We
can’t let it get in the wrong hands

JANICE
Trust no one Except for me

trust in the Lord

so happy when he finds out that we saved
his reputation

detectors German Shepherds glocks you

Lee Ann points to the rolled up GIANT CONFEDERATE FLAG
It lies amongst the lighting bars curtains and special
effects which are waiting to be raised to tbe rafters

That’s so unpatriotic Janice

JANICE
It’s the confederate flag

LEE ANN
But it still represents some of the
states of the union

JANICE
You’re right I’m just gonna go in my
purse

Janice moves around uncomfortably and manages to pee in
her purse

LEE ANN
Did you do it

JANICE
Kind of

LEE ANN
You should throw it out That’s a nice
purse

Janice awkwardly maneuvers her hands out of the flag

She empties out her purse onto some of the many cords
and wires lying on the floor The cords start to SIZZLE
The SPEAKERS BLOW All of the SPECIAL EFFECTS go off at
once The crew guys run for the exits Janice and Lee

There is another long period of silence

LEE ANN
And you play it really well right

JANICE
Lee Ann You are too kind And yes I
do play it really well

Lee Ann thinks some more For a long time

LEE ANN
Well you could win a talent search and
then become famous and get your own album
and then ask Credo to do a guest spot on
your album

JANICE

That is a really good idea
LEE ANN

Thank you
JANICE

We should go to Credo’s label and ask
them when they are having a talent
search

LEE ANN
And while were there we’1ll tell them
that they have a potential publicity
nightmare on their hands and they should
let us talk directly to Gunnar

JANICE

and do the talent search thing later

RON

JANICE
So we have prepared some sample questions
for you all to practice with

Ron rolls his eyes Wayne lamely jumps in

WAYNE
I’ll go first

LEE ANN
Great Okay this one is pretty
difficult but remember the most
important part when dealing with the
press is to speak with conviction And
tell the truth If you were a brick ina
wall which brick would you be and why

RICK
What does this have to do with our tour

WAYNE
They’re just prepping us for the junket
God Rick Have some respect for the
ladies

(he thinks then)

I would be the brick in the bottom
middle because I would like to support
all of my friends

LEE ANN
Excellent

WAYNE
Yeah suck it Rick I’m excellent

RICK
Whatever Youre a douche

WAYNE
Well I’m an eloquent douche

JANICE
Rick why don’t you try one How would
you describe color to a blind person

RON
Are you kidding

RICK
(high but trying)
No I can do it I can do it Well I’d
probably try to relate it to one of the
senses that blind people already have
like smell or hearing And then

DIEGO
-»-Sometimes I can smell color

RICK
-I’d describe red as the smell of
pepper and green as the smell of grass
and blue as the smell of water

Janice and Lee Ann look like they’re in heaven

INT LEE ANN AND JANICE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

Kyle and Ryan the two effeminate overweight 18 year old
boys enter

KYLE
Someday maybe we could be roommates and
we could get an apartment like this

RYAN
That sounds so awesome Sometimes I cut
pictures out of the Pottery Barn magazine
and I make sample living rooms My “Zen
Paradise” is probably my best work

KYLE
I’d love to see it

RYAN
Definitely The best part is that it has
one of those big Asian ceiling fans that
turns really slowly It’s kind of
romantic

They look at each other for a little too long The
sexual tension is palpable Suddenly Kyle grabs a
watering can

KYLE
Okay Ill take the succulents in the
kitchen and you get the plants in the
living room

RYAN
Okay

Productions We’re now moving into
features I’ve written a script about
two postal workers separated by different
Zip codes

JADE
It sounds funny
WARREN
It’s not It takes place during the

Holocaust

(scarily menacing)
Listen here you skanks If you ever
want to pay for law school or send money
to your precious Coo-ba you better get
your well-trod asses out to the next
Credo concert and you get that sex
footage back Or screw Gunnar Trinidad
again and tape it I don’t care We

JANICE
I know I mean the chances of it going
down are already 80 higher than on a
commercial plane

LEE ANN
Why

JANICE
Uh hello Miss American Pie The day

musicians dying in plane crashes is
statistically off the charts

EXT TAQUERIA -—- LATER

Janice and Lee Ann are sitting at one of the umbrella
tables eating their Mexican food plates Lee Ann is
still listing things Gunnar likes while Janice is
distracted watching the sex footage again

LEE ANN
When Gunnar was in eighth grade he loved
skateboarding His favorite football
team is the Broncos

JANICE
I don’t know if any of that helps us

LEE ANN
Oh He loves animals Gunnar’s done a
ton of charity work for animals

JANICE
(looking up from the phone)
Lee Ann that’s brilliant We’ll hold a
benefit concert for animals

LEE ANN

We should have it at a pet shop
JANICE

Or the zoo
LEE ANN

Wait I know the perfect place

Lee Ann pulls a giant stack of pamphlets from her bag
She leafs through them quickly

JANICE
Where did you get those

LEE ANN
By the front desk in the hotel I
thought maybe we could go to this pirate
dinner show

JANICE
That sounds fun

LEE ANN
But this place would be great for the
concert The San Diego Wild Animal
Park The animals run around free
Gunnar would love that

JANICE
Gunnar loves freedom

INT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Janice and Lee Ann are excitedly pitching their idea to
Ron

JANICE
«» and wed open up the Wild Animal Park
at night

LEE ANN
and Credo would perform live on the
Savannah area

JANICE
--and the animals won’t be in cages
they’1l just run free

LEE ANN
and well use all the money to do
nice stuff for the animals like buy them

food
JANICE
or toys
RON
That the most retarded idea I have ever
heard
JANICE

But Gunnar would love it

RON
Gunnar would hate it

LEE ANN
But you have to ask him

RON
(getting an idea)
Okay I’11 pitch him your idea If he
loves it we’ll do it And if he hates
it you’re fired

renee Cian aT ae

JANICE
Okay great
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Gunnar is sitting naked with his junk cleverly concealed
He is making a papier maché sculpture

GUNNAR
I love it

RON
What

GUNNAR

You know how much animals mean to me

RON
I only told you because I thought you’d
realize those publicists are tards I
could have them fired for that shitbag
idea

GUNNAR
There’s never been a shitbag idea that
involves animals Or tards I’ve been
wanting to do something like this
forever It’s been a dream of mine to
rock with the animals

RON
Are you high

GUNNAR
very

INT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Janice and Lee Ann are screaming with joy Lee Ann jumps
up and spills her drink in her lap

RON
Don’t fuck this up

LEE ANN
Listen nothing bad will happen They’re
wild animals

JANICE
The worst thing that could happen is that
someone would get mauled by a large cat
or trampled by a elephant

LEE ANN
Or stabbed by a rhino

JANICE
Or stabbed by a rhino Youre right

LEE ANN
I’ve also seen giraffes that can kick
They sort of rear up on their hind legs
like this and pummel stuff

JANICE
That could happen And who knows what a
herd of zebras would do One zebra is
nothing but a hundred That could
probably cause some serious damage

LEE ANN
I heard that Claudia Schiffer got dry
raped by a dolphin down in Mexico it
could-

RON
This is your last chance or you’re fired

INT WILD ANIMAL PARK OFFICES-— DAY

Lee Ann and Janice are talking to the head of the Wild
Animal Park PHOENIX in his earthy office

PHOENIX
My first concern here is the animals

JANICE
That’s our concern too That’s why we’re
having this concert

PHOENIX
But I just don’t know if it’s a good idea
to let the humans get that close to the
animals Someone could get hurt What
about a net or something Or putting the
humans in a giant cage

LEE ANN
That goes against the whole point of this
concert proving that humans and

animals all live together on earth and we
have to get along We are one We are
made from dust and to dust we shall
return

PHOENIX
I don’t know

JANICE
Look it’s not a big deal We just need
to get one leopard to kind of sit on the
side of the stage-

LEE ANN
-and were hoping a lioness could carry a
cub in her mouth and walk up the center
stairs during the opening song-

JANICE
-and we need something for Gunnar to
vide I was thinking an elephant but
that’s really been played out Do you
think a cheetah could support a human

LEE ANN
I don’t know they’re pretty fast so
we may need some sort of harness or
something

PHOENIX
This is crazy

LEE ANN
Please sir It’s for the animals

How can Phoenix resist the adorable Janice and Lee Ann

INT WARREN TRENDY PRODUCTIONS OFFICE - DAY

WARREN
Those hoochies couldn’t even get close to
the band This is what happens when you
send a woman to do a man’s work I
should have done the job myself

ALISON
You should have had sex with Gunnar
Trinidad

WARREN

No you ass I should have gotten the
tape myself

ALISON
It’s okay if you’re gay

WARREN
I’m not gay Although a gay sex tape
would have probably made me even more
money

ALISON
But then everyone would see you having
sex with him

WARREN
So

ALISON
But then they would think you were gay

WARREN
I’m not gay And you’re a judgmental
little homophobic bitch arent you

ALISON
I’m not homophobic I have a gay uncle

WARREN
Oh everyone has a gay uncle Get me
some tea skank

ALISON
It’s not skank it’s Alison Savitt

WARREN
I said get me some tea skank

ALISON
Fine What kind

WARREN
The usual dammit Chamomile with a
touch of honey ‘Two bags ‘TWO BAGS
It looks like I’m gonna have to take care
of these publicists myself

Warren pulls a pistol from his desk and mimes shooting
it Alison then gives him some tea He drinks it
properly with his pinky extended and everything He then
spits the tea out puts it down and shoots the cup

WARREN (CONT’D)
I said TWO BAGS

Alison looks terrified Warren is evil

EXT WILD ANIMAL PARK — DAY

A giant stage is set up Some animals are haphazardly
poking around sniffing it The crew looks really
nervous A rhino comes dangerously close to a guy
carrying a soundboard lee Ann is bossing people around
while Janice watches the sex footage on the phone

LEE ANN
Glen We’re going to have to get some
hyenas closer to the stage but you need
to keep them on the left because the
gazelles are on the right

RON
This is nuts This is the worst idea

LEE ANN
No it’s not It’s nature Nature is
precious

Just then a WOLF starts to run toward several CREW GUYS
The crew guys scream in terror and jump out of the way
Lee Ann Janice and Ron CLIMB the nearby scaffolding to
get out of the way The wolf tackles a gazelle and
graphically tears it apart

LEE ANN (CONT’D)
(panicked)
See It was nothing

RON
That’s it were cancelling it

JANICE
No we’re not Gunnar wants to do this

RON
Gunnar doesn’t know how dangerous this is
going to be

LEE ANN
Look we’ll make it work Please

JANICE
Please Ron Please

RON
Okay but you two take full
responsibility I want my name nowhere
near this

LEE ANN
We accept all responsibility

RON
(satisfied)
Great It’s all in your hands

EXT WILD ANIMAL PARK NIGHT

The AUDIENCE is filing in The animals pace nervously in
the night unsure about all the humans REVEAL Janice
and Lee Ann are toting giant tranquilizer guns

LEE ANN
This is so brilliant Janice

JANICE
Thank you I’ve seen these things on
Animal Planet They can take down a
bear but not kill it They’re very
useful They use them to move whales and
cougars and stuff

LEE ANN
Could you just teach me how to shoot

JANICE
Well hm

Janice looks at the gun trying to figure it out
JANICE (CONT‘D)

I’m sure it’s probably this dangly thing
here You yank that and um ka pow

LEE ANN
Awesome

EXT WILD ANIMAL PARK -— NIGHT

The concert is going on The humans are all rocking out
and having a great time

GUNNAR
(singing)
When we make love I’m thinking about
her when we do it from behind I’m
picturing her spine

Janice and Lee Ann are smiling proudly from the wings
Just then they hear a giant roar A lion is charging
the stage The audience starts to scream They run
The band is terrified Janice picks up her tranquilizer
gun shoots and misses She hits an audience member a
BIG FRAT GUY In slow motion he COLLAPSES to the
ground like a giant elephant

JANICE
Oh God It’s all up to you Lee Ann

Lee Ann picks up her tranquilizer gun She wobbles with
the weight But then like a pro she shoots it The
lion COLLAPSES a second before mauling Gunnar The
audience cheers

GUNNAR
Rock it lLet’s hear it for the animals

Janice and Lee Ann are elated Ron looks at them mad

EXT STAGE - AFTER THE CONCERT

REPORTERS and TV CREWS are interviewing the band Janice
and Lee Ann are taking charge They’re actually looking
kind of professional now Ron is pouting in the corner

JANICE
KCRW you can have the last question

KCRW REPORTER
Thanks Gunnar what made you decide you
wanted to do a concert here I mean
that was a tense moment there

GUNNAR
Well actually our publicists came up
with the idea But I wasn’t worried I
knew they’d never put us in harms way

Janice and Lee Ann are about to die This is the best
moment of their lives

GUNNAR (CONTD)
I’ve always really loved animals Thats
why I’m a vegetarian But I do eat some
chicken And fish And the occasional hot
dog

LEE ANN
That’s it folks We have to get them to
the after party

JANICE
Thanks for coming We got a report from
the hospital and the young man who was
shot is doing well They expect him to
wake up within the hour and he should be
walking by July

The press conference wraps up Lee Ann and Janice usher
the band out of the press conference

LEE ANN
Gunnar Wait Can we talk to you

Gunnar turns around He opens his mouth to speak but
then Wayne suddenly appears in front of him

WAYNE
Did you guys need to talk to a Trinidad
I’m here

JANICE

Wait we need to talk to Gunnar Wait

But it’s too late He’s surrounded by his groupies and
swept off by the rest of his entourage

WAYNE
IT got a limo if you guys want to ride to
the after party with me

JANICE
Sure
(to Lee Ann)
We’1l just talk to Gunnar there

INT BAR - AFTER THE CONCERT

Rick Wayne Diego Janice Lee Ann Hannah and a bunch
of groupies are all hanging out at the bar They are all
drunk and high

RICK
I don’t know if it was the gazelles or
just the high I get from charity work
but I feel so freakin’ good right now

JANICE
Do you think Gunnar enjoyed the concert

WAYNE
Are you kidding I haven’t seen him wail
like that in years

LEE ANN
Thanks so great What time do you think
he‘1l show up here

HANNAH
Who knows There were some UCSD
cheerleaders in the crowd he has a
soft spot for pom poms And sluts

JANICE
But he’1ll still come right

HANNAH
Probably I don’t know

RICK
Let’s raise our joints in honor of Janice
and Lee Ann You girls really pulled it
off tonight

WAYNE
Hell Ill pull something off tonight ya
know

Everyone ignores Wayne as they toast Lee Ann and Janice

LEE ANN
Thanks so much for letting us be a part
of your tour

JANICE
I don’t know how to say thank you-

LEE ANN
Oh I know You should sing a song
She’s so talented

JANICE
Lee Ann I don’t even have a guitar
There’s no way

HANNAH
There’s one on that stage

JANICE
I couldn’t Okay

Janice gets up and immediately grabs it She returns to
the table Lee Ann reaches into her purse and pulls out
some claves the hollow wooden sticks you use to keep
rhythm in elementary music class

LEE ANN
I always keep these claves in my purse

Janice tunes up the guitar She starts singing in her
folksy way Lee Ann rhythmically pounds on the claves

JANICE
There’s something about their music that
makes me smile Something about their
music that makes me stop to think a while
something about the band that makes my
heart skip a beat and they’re the
reason it’s chili con queso I eat

Lee Ann harmonizes on the chorus Clearly they’ve
practiced this a million times

JANICELEE ANN
(singing)
Because Credo is my favorite band
they’ve been with me through thick and
thand

LEE ANN
Rick plays lead guitar he’ll always be
a shining star he grew up in
Philadelphia His cable company is
Adelphia He gets the star package which
includes HBO but not Cinemax and
there’s Diego the drummer he tried to
buy a Hummer but they didn’t have it in
red so he got an Escalade instead with
license plate 4TTN68

The band members and the groupies start to look a little
weirded out

JANICE
and Wayne’s last name is Trinidad just
like Gunnar and why is that It’s
because they have the same dad And
Robert Michael Trinidad (Social Security
Number 635-87-2463) is the luckiest
father in the world because his son
Gunnar is the most beautiful talented
flaxen haired he-man ever known to my
eyes

JANICELEE ANN

(singing)
Because Credo is my favorite band
theyve been with me through thick and
thand I love them so much I would die
for them I would shed my blood and kill
my kids if they asked me to I love
Credo yes I do

The song ends There is a moment of silence It’s
awkward People are very stoned and not sure what just
happened but then Wayne starts clapping

WAYNE
Awesome

Everyone joins in pretty sure they were too high to
“understand

RICK
If I weren’t so high right now I would
have sung right along

LEE ANN
Isn’t she talented

JANICE
Thanks Lee Ann Thank you everyone
Now if you’ll excuse us we should just
run to the comfort room

Lee Ann grabs Janice and they head for the restroom

LEE ANN
You did so well They loved it

JANICE
I can’t wait for Gunnar to show up
Maybe theyll ask me to sing it for him
(MORE )

JANICE (CONTD)

tonight

Lee Ann smiles humble

EXT BAR - NIGHT

Alison waves it threateningly at the girls

WARREN (CONT’D)

Janice and Lee Ann gasp

JANICE
How did you find us

WARREN
I did a little detective work Now give

Janice searches frantically through her purse

LEE ANN
Where is it

JANICE
I don’t know where it is I thought it
was right here

LEE ANN
What did you do with it

JANICE
I don’t know

Janice dumps her purse out on the seat There are about
50 super-size tampons in it They frantically search
through the junk and check all their pockets

WARREN
Oh so that’s how you’re going to play
it Well listen here You give me that
phone by midnight tonight or I’m going
to cut Gunnar Trinidad’s balls off

Janice and Lee Ann are horrified This is the worst
possible thing that anyone could threaten

LEE ANN
NOOOOOOOOOHI PI Lirriye

JANICE
YOU CAN’T CUT GUNNAR’S BALLS OFF

WARREN
Iocan and will Unless you get me that
footage

LEE ANN

But we don’t know where it is

Janice and Lee Ann try to open the doors They can’t

ALISON
I think the childproof locks are on

WARREN
Dammit How do you do this

Alison reaches across and tries to unlock the locks It
takes a lot of fiddling It’s awkward Finally the
girls climb out

EXT PT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS
Janice and Lee Ann finally get out They look terrified

Warren leans out the window and mimes snipping off
testicles with scissors before he drives away

JANICE
We cannot let that man cut Gunnar’s balls
off

LEE ANN

I’d rather die I would rather die a
bloody death than be the reason that
Gunnar Trinidad lost his balls

JANICE
Come on let’s get that phone

The girls go running off to the hotel

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a mess Janice and Lee Ann are rifling
through everything There are clothes all over The
mini bar food is on the floor

LEE ANN
Think Think Where did you put it

Janice has several flashbacks

EXT GROCERY STORE — DAY

Janice has a bag of groceries and the phone She is
watching the sex footage as she walks toward her car
She puts the phone on top of her car as she unlocks the
door She puts the groceries into the car but leaves
the phone on top of it She drives off The phone
teeters precariously on top of the car

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Janice is watching the sex footage A spider crawls by
Janice tries to beat the spider to death with the phone
It’s a mad chase

INT KITCHEN - EVENING

Janice is watching the sex footage She opens the
cabinet door and pulls out some microwave popcorn She
puts down the phone to take the plastic off the bag of
popcorn She puts the phone in the microwave and tries
to watch the bag The phone spins and sizzles in the
microwave for a moment before Janice rescues it

INT HOTEL ROOM - AS BEFORE

LEE ANN
Janice Henderson I hate to say this but
you are irresponsible

JANICE

LEE ANN
You are the smartest most talented
person I know but you artist types are
all alike you’re trapped in your own
brilliant head so much that you are very
irresponsible

JANICE
I can’t believe youre saying this

LEE ANN
Well it’s true You may be the reason
that Gunnar Trinidad gets his balls cut
off If you cared about Gunnar as much as
I do you would have taken better care of
that phone

JANICE
How dare you How dare you How dare
you question my loyalty to Gunnar I’m
the one that has been watching that
footage I’m the one that has been
repeatedly soaking in his sexual
humiliation just to take away a little
bit of the pain that those horrible women
caused him

LEE ANN
Well that’s nothing compared to the pain
of having your balls cut off

JANICE
That is so unfair

Janice picks up a Snickers and throws it at the curtain

LEE ANN
I can’t believe that You know how much
I love Snickers

Lee Ann picks up Janice’s guitar and starts turning the
tuning keys

JANICE
I just tuned it You are a bad person

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Janice runs into the bathroom Lee Ann follows her
Janice gets out the free sewing kit and rips it apart

LEE ANN
I can not believe you You know I
collect those sewing kits Okay if
youre going to hit below the belt

Lee Ann starts pulling towels off the racks and putting
them into the bathtub

JANICE
Aaaaagh Those don’t need to be washed
yet You’re killing the environment

LEE ANN
Wait Wait I found it

There in the sticky wet soapdish lying on top of the bar
of soap is the phone Lee Ann picks it up

JANICE
Oh my God I was watching it when I was
shaving I’m so sorry

LEE ANN
Janice I’m sorry I should have never
called you irresponsible

JANICE
And I should have been more careful You
do love Gunnar as much as I do

They go to hug Just as they do the phone slips out of
Lee Anns hand and Janice steps on it CRUNCH The
girls look down mortified The phone lies in pieces

LEE ANN
Oh my God

JANICE
He’s gonna cut Gunnar’s balls off

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The girls cry and hold each other as they walk into the
main room

LEE ANN
What are we going to do

JANICE
I don’t know We could kidnap Gunnar and
run to Mexico

LEE ANN
But I don’t have a passport

JANICE
I know me neither

LEE ANN
We could go to Arizona and try to sneak
across the border

JANICE
The Mexicans would try to block our way
LEE ANN
I don’t know I don’t know We’re so
screwed
JANICE

Okay think Mr Trendy said he wants
sex footage of Gunnar Trinidad Clearly
he wants to exploit Gunnar

LEE ANN
Maybe we should hire some girls to have
sex with him and we’1l just film it
again

JANICE
Then Mr Trendy gets what he wants and
Gunnar’s balls stay intact

LEE ANN
But his reputation will still be ruined

JANICE
It doesn’t matter It’s better than
having his balls cut off That’s for
damn sure

LEE ANN
Where are we going to get some whores to
recreate that footage

JANICE
There’s no time And they won’t know the
moves

LEE ANN
You mean

JANICE
We need to have sex with Gunnar
ourselves

LEE ANN

This is a sacrifice I feel I must make

JANICE
That’s the spirit Lee Ann We have to
put our plan in fast forward and find
him right now Okay where should we
look He could have shown up to the bar
now

Janice grabs her cell phone The girls exit the hotel’
room to the hallway

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

LEE ANN
I remember reading in the fanzine that
someone once spotted him at an
AppleBee’s If he’s not at the bar we
should check every AppleBee’s in town

JANICE
Okay and we know his favorite drink is a
whiskey sour

(MORE)

JANICE (CONTD)
So we should make a list of all the bars
and restaurants that serve whiskey sours
in a three mile radius

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

LEE ANN
Great I have some maps We can plot our
coordinates on these

Lee Ann pulls out a thousand maps from her purse’

JANICE
We also know that he hates posers So we
should survey some locals to find out
where posers hang out We can then cross
those locales off our list because it’s a
guarantee that he won’t be there

The elevator doors open and standing there with a light
surrounding him in all of his rock glory alone is
GUNNAR TRINIDAD Janice and Lee Ann are frozen This is
their dream come true It’s the world’s longest dramatic
pause And then a brave voice cries out

LEE ANN
Want to have a three way

GUNNAR
Sure

TRIUMPHANT MUSIC

INT PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

Gunnar is quite high The girls have tied him up
Janice is recording everything with a different cell
phone

JANICE
(quietly)
Okay Lee Ann when I give you the cue
you knock on the door and take five steps
toward the bed before bending over and
showing your chest Be sure to wiggle
it

Lee Ann exits Janice has posed herself awkwardly above
Gunnar She has a scary look of lust on her face

GUNNAR
Whered that other one go

SFX Knocking

JANICE
Come in If you like to screw

Lee Ann enters She takes five deliberate steps toward
the bed and then unnaturally leans over pushing her
boobs uncomfortably together

JANICE (CONTD)
Oh it looks like someone wants to join
in the action

GUNNAR
What are you talking about

LEE ANN
Yeah I want to join in I’ve been so
horny all day And now I just want to

Lee Ann goes to touch Janice’s boob

JANICE (CONTD)

Lee Ann squeezes it uncomfortably hard Janice winces

JANICE (CONT’D)
(lying)
Mmm that feels great Let me touch
your melons

Janice pokes at Lee Ann’s boobs

LEE ANN
Yeah do you like that

GUNNAR
You guys are freaks

JANICE
What’s that You want her to eat me out
while she sits on your face

LEE ANN
Ewww

JANICE

Lee Ann awkwardly positions her butt on Gunnar’s face
GUNNAR
(muffled)
I can’t breathe

offscreen Lee Ann leans forward as if she’s going to
give oral sex to Janice She quickly comes up

LEE ANN
Can‘t do it
JANICE
But they did it on the phone
LEE ANN
You do it
JANICE
Fine

Offscreen Janice leans down as if she’s going to give
Lee Ann oral sex She quickly resurfaces

JANICE (CONT’D)
Nope Not gonna happen

GUNNAR
Get off my face

JANICE
(whispered to Lee Ann)
Okay let’s just get to the hot wax part

Janice lights two candles They are large scented
Yankee candles

LEE ANN
They used these in the video

JANICE
No but they smell good Butter cream and
Granny Smith

LEE ANN
Yum

JANICE
Okay now drip hot wax on his chest

Lee Ann drips hot wax on his nipples

GUNNAR
My nipples Ouch

LEE ANN

Lee Ann rips it off It yanks out a bunch of his chest
hair

GUNNAR
Oh my God OUCH Look just get out of
here I can get myself off

JANICE

Oh no the best is yet to come I hope
you like spankings

Janice pulls out a bent wire hanger

GUNNAR
What the hell is that

JANICE
Improvised whip okay

GUNNAR
No

Janice goes to hit him with it She accidentally hits
Lee Ann who drops the candle onto the floor The flame
quickly spreads from the carpet to the curtains

GUNNAR (CONT’D)
Aaagh Help Untie me

LEE ANN
Oh shit Oh shit

The girls try unsuccessfully to put out the flames

GUNNAR
God dammit Untie me

JANICE
Just a second

LEE ANN
We have it under control

Just then the fire alarms go off and the sprinklers
start spraying

GUNNAR
What the hell are you bitches doing

And then the whole story all comes flooding out while
the fire alarms and the sprinklers continue

JANICE
Were trying to save you from getting
your balls cut off okay

LEE ANN
See we found this phone that had this
sex footage of you and we thought that
these whores in it were going to exploit
you And we didn’t want them to harm
your reputation So we got hired as
Credo’s publicists so that we could warn
you

JANICE
But then the guy who owned the phone came
to get it and threatened to cut your
balls off But we broke the phone while

reputation

running into the disaster of a room with some COPS

candle

RON

RON
No they didn’t I spoke with Sam Ballard
and they never hired new publicists

LEE ANN
No We went to the label and said there
was a problem and they gave us plane
tickets and told us to deal with it
They gave us a per diem

RON

world

JANICE

But it’s not a fantasy world They gave
us a per diem

Janice is behind the counter looking relatively
miserable She is ringing up a purchase for a MAN who is

as she is

a shed or anything vodka’s the cheapest
way to go

Just then we hear the radio announcer
RADIO ANNOUNCER (OS)

Credo “Say Goodbye to Saying Hello”

Lee Ann and Janice both run and pounce on the radio to
turn it off

EXT MEN’S BIG N’ TALL SHOP — DAY

A limo pulls up in front of the store Several GAWKERS
watch expectantly

from the inevitable autographs The gawkers look
disappointed

GAWKER 1
Who’s that

GAWKER 2
Must be some guy on his way to prom

The gawkers head off Wayne enters the store

JANICE
It’s Wayne Lee Ann weve got to get
out of here

Janice and Lee Ann move around the store to try to stay
100 feet away from him

WAYNE
Hi Janice Lee Ann

LEE ANN

Every step he takes toward them they step away

WAYNE
Don’t worry we’ve dropped the

JANICE
to Lee Ann)
It’s a trap
(calling out to Wayne)
Stay back

WAYNE
But I need to talk to you

LEE ANN
We can talk from here

What should be a heartwarming intimate conversation is
now awkward due to the distance between the parties

WAYNE
Look Gunnar Rick Diego and I got
together and we talked We realized how
much work you did for us and what a
difference you made

Janice and Lee Ann look flattered

LEE ANN
Really

WAYNE
Of course You helped us save a bunch of
animals and you opened up our audience
to middle aged women zookeepers and big
game hunters Our record sales are
through the roof It’s all because of
you And that’s why we want you back

WAYNE

JANICE
