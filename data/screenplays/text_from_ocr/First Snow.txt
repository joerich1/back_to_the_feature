FIRST SNOW
FADE IN

A TIGHT SHOT JIMMY MUNSON’s face in the shadows A peculiar
stillness to him Eyes blank lifeless Tinny SOUNDS of an
Oldies radio station waft from somewhere

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY — NIGHT

A car idles at a crossroads The chugging of the exhaust pipe
mingles with the fizzy tune

BACK TO Jimmys expressionless face As we begin suspecting
he’s dead a cigarette arrives at his lips He drags deeply
savoring the smoke Soon--

Approaching headlights begin filling out the darkness and we
keep PULLING BACK slowly revealing weve been watching Jimmy
through the open driver’s window And we see--

His white collar shirt is soaked with blood

The WHOOSH of the approaching car crescendos its headlights
burning the screen white We hold then--

FADE IN FROM WHITE

EXT TOWN OF EPANOLA - DAY (SIX WEEKS EARLIER)

Jimmy’s Camry a few years past its prime rattles off the
highway into a service station--dragging some of its guts in tow
The ATTENDANT a sunbaked Latino raises an eyebrow

SERVICE STATION - MINUTES LATER

Jimmy paces one trembling hand shielding the sun the other
grasping a cell-phone--his lifeblood companion He’s in his late
30s and most of it appears to have been smooth easy road But
right now he’s pissed

JIMMY
--right out in front of me you
shoulda’ seen this moron Un-
fucking-believable Two seconds to
decide if I’m in the ditch or up
this clown’s asshole

(shakes his head)
Sixty thousand miles the past two
years without so much as a flat
Then this cocksucker-

Jimmy notices the mechanic gesturing him over

JIMMY
Listen I gotta check on my wheels
Should be an hour or two most
Need you to drop in on Morelane for
me--keep the coals glowing

He balances a huge Filofax on his knee--spilling over with the
clutter of his busy existence Flips a few pages reads

JIMMY
Five-thirty Says he might re-do
the whole mall in Nob Hill ‘round
Christmas time (beat) Jesus Ed
you owe me -- I wouldn’t be out
here in-in “Low Rider” Central
‘cept to cover your ass (beat)
Yeah love you too I’11 let you
blow me when I get back

Jimmy pockets the phone and approaches the mechanic

JIMMY
So hows the patient

ATTENDANT
Ripped up the undercarriage pretty
good Going to be a while This
evenin’ maybe

JIMMY

Evening Can’t you just--
ATTENDANT

Need parts -- new set of bushings

Got a man coming down from Santa Fe

Jimmy regards the sparse town behind him -- looking past vendors
in the adjacent lot selling their wares from the backs of
pickups No fucking way he’s hanging around here

He sizes the mechanic up squints at the name on his overalls

JIMMY
Listen - Enrique I’ve been on
the road since seven I’m a sales-
man Got a wife at home a week to
the stork and--well she gets ner-
vous when I‘m held up

The Attendant’s sympathetic smile evaporates as he spies Jimmy’s
hand sans wedding band Jimmy quickly stuffs the hand in his
pocket but the moment is lost

ATTENDANT
Like I said -- this evening at best

JIMMY
(a sigh erupts)
Anyinteresting diversions

ATTENDANT
Some cliffs about a mile walk
Pretty sunsets

Jimmy does a 360 surveys his scant options and we CUT TO

INT TAVERN - LATER

Jimmy clicks off his cellphone rocks restlessly ona barstool
A plate arrives in front of him -- the steak and egg “cardiac”
special -- along with a flirty wink from the WAITRESS

Jimmy admires the shape of her Levis then turns to the
BARTENDER who delivers a fresh scotch as if on cue Jimmys
recharged with the confidence of a few drinks Sleeves rolled
up revealing his gold watch -- no Rolex but on his way

JIMMY

Pete wasn’t it Listen to this
Got a contact down in Hallandale
who’s giving me a sweet deal ona
fleet of retired jukes Wurlitzers
the vintage 1015s Classic Ameri-
cana Had them all refurbished and
get this--they’ve all got the ori-
ginal 45s in them No shit

(sips his scotch)
Drop one of those in the corner
and you’d have the classiest joint
in a hundred miles

BARTENDER
Already got a jukebox

JIMMY
True but we’re talking a Wurlitzer
here A ‘1015’ Most popular juke-
box model of all time People can’t
help but stuff them full of cash
(leans a bit closer)
I’m looking around here and I see
a guy who’s simple unpretentious--
but who gives a shit about his
place Brass polished Bathrooms
clean Liquor arranged just so
A guy with his own sense of style

This Bartender’s heard it all holds his granite stare Jimmy
quick-draws a business card and slides it across the bartop

JIMMY
Don’t decide now Think about it
Right in that corner A glowing
tribute to PresleyOtis Redding
Buddy Holly (winks) Guaranteed
money magnet

The Bartender looks at the card confused

BARTENDER
Says here you sell flooring

JIMMY
Right now yeah But in a few
months I’m breaking out on my own
It’s all mapped out
(raises his glass)
To bigger and better

Jimmy finishes the drink goes to work on his food His
attention is drawn to the vendors outside in the twilight -- in
particular a fortune teller by his battered 50sstyle RV camper

JIMMY
Not trying to snow you Pete Just
sniffin’ for a win-win situation

POV CLOSER -- the FORTUNE TELLER a shadowy figure sitting in a
lawn chair face obscured by a newspaper

JIMMY (V0)
--now theres a guy with the ‘sales-
man’ in his blood Sizes up a total
strangertailors the message just
right Whatever they want to hear
need to hear If he’s any good
that is

Jimmy shrugs picks up his cellphone -- but the battery alarm
protests His gaze returns to the fortune teller then he laughs
to himself a thought striking

JIMMY
Christ what the hell--call it
“research”
(settles his tab)
Think it over what we talked about

Jimmy heads for the door still finishing his drink As he
reaches the exit --

BARTENDER
Leave the glass

Jimmy grins places it on the jukebox gesturing again to that
‘perfect corner’ As the door slams the Barman moves to flip
Jimmy’s card in the trash -- then stops He glances over to his

pathetic juke squints ever so slightly as if imagining

EXT TAVERN - DUSK

Jimmy shuffles through the near-empty lot past peddlers selling
hand crafted wallets chili ristras sunflowers He hums a
little Otis Redding still cheery from the liquor

He reaches a crude hand-painted sign proclaiming “VACARO --
TELLER OF FORTUNES” VACARO folds his paper rises from the
lawnchair -- a man of indeterminate age and ethnicity

JIMMY
Let me guessyou’ve been expect
ing me right

Vacaro allows a polite smile as he folds the chair He speaks
softly each word measured

VACARO
Just closing up shop Slow day

JIMMY
“No kiddin’ You mean it gets busy

VACARO
Youd be surprised

Vacaro nods politely and moves for the RV door

JIMMY
So -- how much for a reading

VACARO
(a moment assessing)
Ten dollars

JIMMY
Bit steep isn’t it

NOS
fs
VACARO
‘I charge what you can afford

Jimmy grins he likes this guy’s style Checks his watch

JIMMY
All right why not

Vacaro opens the camper door for Jimmy who steps up fishing out
the money He suddenly stops

JIMMY
This doesn’t involve killing any
poultry does it

VACARO
Not unless you’d like it to

INT CAMPER - MINUTES LATER

Notable only for its lack of distinction -- no beads candles
mystical bric-a-brac An ordinary travelers setup

Jimmy’s face registers disappointment Vacaro motions him to
sit then takes a seat opposite him at a small table A ceramic
Jackalope with exaggerated eyes stares up at Jimmy

JIMMY
What no crystal ball

VACARO
It’s in the shop
(reaching out)
The energy is stronger if I touch
your hand -- but not required

JIMMY
(offers Vacaro his left)
Yeah whatever Do your thing

Vacaro places his leathery hand over Jimmys grasps it gently

JIMMY
Sohow does this work I ask
specific questions or--

VACARO
What would you like to know Mr--

JIMMY
Munson Jimmy Munson I don’t know
(shrugs) I’11 leave it up to you
Dazzle me ‘the whole show
‘(a sudden thought)
Hey what about my car Think it’ll
make it home

Vacaro nods then closes his eyes concentrates as if listening
to far away voices Jimmy can barely keep a straight face

VACARO
(sober serious)
It will
JIMMY
Woah -- just from touching my hand

Amazing What else you picking up

VACARO
Roads purple mountainsa woman’s
waiting for you there (beat) She
makes you feel twenty again

JIMMY
Yeah What’s she wearing

VACARO
(ignoring the quip)
A noisy mind cluttered with fears
Strong ambition - it has brought
you trouble in the past

Jimmy’s grin wanes a notch - that one may have touched a nerve
Vacaro’s eyes open sensing discomfort

JIMMY
(switching gears)
How ‘bout them Lobos Think I
should take the spread

VACARO
I wouldn’t bet against them

JIMMY
shaking his head)
You kiddin’ me With Olney ‘on
crutches Forget it That kid’s
their secret weapon

VACARO
Olney will recover

JIMMY
From a blown knee Sorry chief
he’s out for the count Doc said
he tore the tendon

VACARO
(permits a smile)
Wouldn’t bet against them

Jimmy shrugs and laughs His free hand instinctively massages
the edge of his hairline

VACARO
Don’t worry Mr Munson--no bald-
ness in your clan

Now Jimmy is hooked -- this guy is a trip He leans in as if
proffering a challenge

JIMMY
All right let’s look down the road
a bit Got a business venture sort
ofhanging in limbo Tell me
how’s that looking

VACARO
Mmmthe future That will re-
quire a deeper descent

A silence then Vacaro clears his throat stares apologetically
down at his hands Jimmy grins in understanding -- fishes out a
fiver and holds it up Vacaro nods his approval takes the bill

He closes his eyes once more his face rippling through a range
of emotions After a silence --

VACARO
Mmmyour venture is secure You
will benefit from a windfall a
large sum of money Coming to you
by way of Texas

JIMMY
(snorting)
Texas Don’t know anyone in Texas
but I’ll take it Nothing but sunny
skies ahead eh (beat) Hey ask
Elvis if--

Jimmy reacts as Vacaro’s grip suddenly tightens

JIMMY —
Hey chief That’s a bit--

His eyes widen as Vacaro begins convulsing violently in his
chair his white-knuckle grip now painful

Finally Vacaro snaps back releasing Jimmy’s hand as if he’s just
been scalded The ceramic figurine wobbles on the table then
falls to the floor and shatters
)

JIMMY
Jesus what the (beat) You
all right old man

Vacaro is on his feet a step back from the table rubbing his
hands together -- expression grave Jimmy is a bit spooked

VACARO
Imy concentration was broken

JIMMY
breathes relief)
Christ thought you were having a
goddamn coronary (beat) You sure
youre all right

Vacaro nods weakly remains frozen Jimmy kneels begins

gathering up the statue fragments He picks up a ceramic eye
winks back at it

JIMMY
S’okay 111 let you catch your
breath a minute

VACARO
I’m afraid the session is over

JIMMY
(stops cleaning)
Huh You kidding me That was
fifteen bucks worth

VACARO
I’m sorry I do not control the
vision I am its servant

JIMMY
(irritated)
No offense but I’ve had better
fortune cookies

He finishes with the glass then smiles as a thought hits him

JIMMY
Thats good Youre good
He makes a gesture -- a hook in his mouth the snared fish
JIMMY
(standing)
All part of the show ain’t it
Let me guess - another twenty and

maybe just maybe you can summon the
ol’ vision back Another ten spot
and I find outmy hamster is in

grave danger Something like that
right

Vacaros heavy expression doesn’t waver Color gone from his

face

JIMMY
Not bad Almost had me Just
(fingers pinched)
this far over the line I like the
routine knocking over the statue
whole bit But the freak-out it’s
a bit over the top don’t you think
(checks his watch)
Tell you what -- I still got time
to kill And I’m intrigued We
could learn from each other Why
don’t werewind a bit give it
another crack

VACARO
The session is over Mr Munson

JIMMY
What you sore ‘cause I saw through
some parlor tricks (laughs) I’m sort
of an expert in the area So ¢’mon
at least give me my money’s worth

Vacaro feebly fishes in his pocket holds Jimmy’s money out

Jimmy flustered takes it and moves for the RV door

JIMMY
Got a strange way of doing business
partner

VACARO

Go now Please

EXT RV - NIGHT

Jimmy descends as the door closes behind him latches

to himself unfolds Vacaro’s lawn chair and plops down

fumbles through his jacket for cigarettes

JIMMY

(lighting up)
Diamond in the rough chief but
you gotta work on your presentation
Half the game right there Get
yourself some beads pack of Tarots
some decent lighting And keep a
feel-good spin on things Could
have the suckers lined up

He laughs
He

Jimmy shrugs as the RV lights go out He tosses his smoke as he
spots the mechanic backing his car out from the garage
INT JIMMY’S CAR - NIGHT

In the soft dash glow Jimmy drums his fingers on the wheel
keeping time with the radio Feeling good

POV - on the side of the road a scraggly HITCHIKER sticks out
his thumb hopefully

JIMMY
Dream on partner
EXT JIMMY’S CAR - SAME TIME

LOW ANGLE THE ROAD lunging at us from the darkness beyond the
headlights The steady HUM of tires on asphalt Suddenly we--

All chat in a split second

JIMMY

His hands slide along her hips dragging her skirt with them
DEIRDRE
(to the wall)

Amazing -- this guy still thinks

INT BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jimmy hangs on for dear life as Deirdre rides him frantically
And as things go DEFCON4 the PHONE RINGS

They’re doing their damnedest to block it out but it’s
winningand finally the machine kicks in The greeting ends
followed by a Man’s voice

MAN (0S)

Jimmy shifts an eye towards the machine

DETRDRE
Don’t you dare--don’t you--

JIMMY

JIMMY
Give me an hour

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

ANDY LOPEZ is a late-twenties hot-head who moves like a mongoose
He’s a sharp dresser hair set perfectly with pomade Hes
standing beside Jimmy at a roadside hot dog stand

Andy cracks himself up Jimmy is edgy uncomfortable

JIMMY
Listen Roy may be a hard on -- but

This is a tricky game No-one
- tells you when the rules change

The hot dogs arrive Jimmy pays for them and they stroll along

JIMMY
You’ve got a hell of a future Andy
Always been one of my sharpest guys
But you’re a big dreamer a lot like
myself -- and sometimes you’re gonna
look for those short-cuts

Andy stops short of biting into his hot dog
JIMMY
This company is justone eddy in
a big ol’ river I’m getting out

And now something trips in Andys mind

ANDY
Jimbowhat are we doing here

Jimmy is still looking at Andy from behind his shades

ANDY

Andy raises a finger takes a moment to gather his thoughts

ANDY

up for it next month--
(suddenly angry)
Shit Jimmy you practically taught
me how to pad my sheets--

JIMMY
You got nailed kid
(shakes his head)

Jimmy looks down at his untouched hot dog The incredulity rips
through Andy fury welling up in him

JIMMY

Lopez flings his food at Jimmy wreaking havoc on his shirt

JIMMY
Hey For fuck’s--

ANDY

holding his stony demeanor

soaked from a run He can’t help but pull his bangs back eyeing
the hairline A hint of recession he’s concerned about

steering wheel He reaches for his Marlboros on the dash shakes
one out and lights it He drags deeply -- then suddenly regards
the cigarette and tosses it out the window Crushes the pack

INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

Jimmy is sandwiched between two senior citizens looking out of
Place in the drab waiting room He’s twisting a coffee stirrer
in his hand knotting and re-knotting it He folds his legs
unfolds them--exhales glances at his watch

CcuT TO

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICEEXAMINING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON a monitor the magnetic resonance image of a pumping
heart--squeezing life with a grating mechanical wheeze

ANGLE ON Jimmy lying on one side a sonogram gun against his
chest Eyes wide at the shrill sounds imagining the worst

DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

Jimmy is sitting upright putting his shirt on DOCTOR BATES
analyzes data from the echo-cardio machine

JIMMY
Didn’t sound so hot

BATES
Oh you mean the noise That’s just
the machine

Bates tears off a long strip of paper from the device sits

BATES
Well what we’re looking at here is
a simple mitro-valve prolapse

JIMMY
(tightening)
-hell is that

BATES
A bit of a lazy vaive
(demonstrates with a fist)
Heart squeezes blood out the valve
doesn’t close all the way and some
of it backflows (beat) Usually a
benign condition

JIMMY
Lazy valve
(relief spreading)
So so I’m basically all right then
You-didn’t see anything else

BATES
No looks good We’1l schedule you
an echo for next year start keeping
an eye on that valve But otherwise

(exhales)
Sothere’s nothing I gotta change

INT THE FIREHOUSE PUB NIGHT

Jimmy salvages an unbroken Marlboro from the pack he crushed

earlier and as we PULL BACK he lights up

grinning stepping to a jukebox tune

He walks to the bar

He reaches the bar slaps down a bill and his usual arrives

JIMMY
Any news on the pool

The Bartender (SAMMY) gives a sly smile pulls a huge roll of

twenties from his shirt pocket

JIMMY

He takes his drink turns to see ED JACOMO and a few guys at a
nearby table -- work buddies Jimmy grabs a seat

ED
(a nod towards Sammy)
What kind of freak bets against a
sure thing

Jimmy’s attention goes to the TV set up on the wall

POV - the basketball game A shot of ROYCE OLNEY the Lobos’
“secret weapon” sinking a beauty from 3-point range

COMMENTATOR (VO)
-Olney’s stupendous comeback from
injuries most thought would sideline
him for the season Unbelievable

We HOLD on Jimmy for a few beats dumbfounded as he watches the
screen A balled-up napkin from the bar snaps him out of it He
turns to Sammy

BARTENDER
Shouldnt bet against the home team
‘s bad luck

THE BAR - LATER

Music Laughter Chatter Jimmy is the usual life of the
party keeping everyone’s glass full A local girl cackles at his
joke leans against him a bit too friendly Jimmy doesn’t mind

Eyes shift to the door as ROY HARRIS enters the bar scans the
room Formerly ‘one of the guys’ who’s clearly stepped up in the
world The revelry downshifts a notch as he reaches the table

ROY
-fellas
(nods to the TV)
Catch them Lobos Un-fuckin’-

Ad-libbed responses as Roy puts a hand on Jimmy’s shoulder
ROY

eyebrow to the “oohs” and “aahs” of the others

ROY

Right right Anyway all night
I’m watching people--lining up
to stuff this thing full of money

heard of And then it hits me--
it’s the goddamn “intangibles”
just like Jimmy Munson said

JIMMY
Yeah you know nostalgia can be--

ROY
(shoving in)
I think we should give your idea
a whirl Maybe scaled back a bit
test the waters But who knows we
could be sittin’ on a winner here

JIMMY
You mean-- Oh Jeez that’s fan-
tastic No no I’ve done the num-
bers this thing is real sound

(suddenly struck)
Wait you said you were in Dallas

A FLASH in Jimmy’s memory - the fortune teller‘’s ceramic
Jackalope shatters in slow motion
ROY
Dallas Texas The self-same

Over Roy’s shoulder Jimmy sees Olney on the TV sinking another
sweet one for ‘three’ His eyes linger on the screen--like he’s
trying to compute some impossible equation

ROY
Come by Monday before you hit the
pavement We’ll start working out
the details Jimmy Jimmy

Jimmy comes out of it a little hazy returns his eyes to Roy

Certain things have happened Co-
incidences Stuff you couldn’t
have known unless

VACARO
Unless what sir

JIMMY
Well unlessyou were for real

Vacaro pauses -- unnerved by this conversation Then he returns
to his tinkering

VACARO
I’m a performer Mr Munson A
salesman You said it yourself
I tell people what they want to
hear--like a fortune cookie

JIMMY
A performer doesn’t stop half-way
through the act Salesman doesn’t
give refunds

Jimmy exhales heavily as Vacaro faces him

JIMMY
The Lobos game -this this money
my boss promises me out of the blue
You knew it was coming from Dallas
for Chrissakes What are the
chances

VAI a
A few lucky guegges -- my gift to

a
you (beat) If I recall youd

had quite a lot to drink that night

Vacaro slams the hood shut and rounds the RV
ready to let it go

JIMMY

That seizure It was likeyou
were pulling your hand off a hot
stove Like you saw something

VACARO
(getting impatient)

Jimmy

Parlor tricks Part of the show
I only regret you saw through them

(pastes on a smile)

Even if I could see things -- you
seem to be a man who twists destiny
to fit him What would it matter

JIMMY
(nerves rising)

So wait wait now you’re sayin’--

VACARO
Go live your life Mr Munson

For-

get all this It serves no purpose

JIMMY

I had a bit of a seare a few days

ago My health Is that it

(beat) Listen I’m sure you got
some code of ethics here but I

can handile--

Vacaro searches Jimmys eyes as if sizing him up

VACARO
I saw nothing Good day

tails

Then--

not

He turns away reaches for some tools in the camper’s cargo hold

JIMMY

All right then - let’s do it

He shoves past Vacaro opens the RV door and enters caro
tosses down his toolkit exasperated and follows Jimmy inside

INT RV - CONTINUOUS

Vacaro

Vacaro closes the door finds Jimmy seated -- a knot of bills
splayed on the table next to a new ceramic Jackalope
Vacaro regards

And now anger erupts
knocking the table over

And now Jimmy is right up against him and can see--

POV - CLOSE on Vacaro his eyes filled with terror

JIMMY
I want another reading

VACARO
I am not open for business

JIMMY
I’1l pay double

Jimmy sadly shakes his head

VACARO
Don’t do this Go live your life

JIMMY
(irritation growing)
I’m offering you money You’re a
businessman Take it

VACARO
You had your reading

JIMMY
Amam I missing something here
What is the angle old man

JIMMY
(cornering Vacaro)
You have no rightto toy with
people like this Now I want a
goddamn reading

Jimmy leaps up in frustration almost
Vacaro steps back as Jimmy approaches

Jimmy shrinks away as the cold realization begins to set in

Vacaro breathes heavily kneads his hands together
his eyes turning to compassion

Jimmy stands frozen breathless letting it sink in

begins pacing

VACARO
I saw no more roads No more
tomorrows
(a grave pause)
Not much time left I’m sorry

shaking his head
JIMMY

Is that rightthat right
then laughing nervously)

And in a low croak--

The fear

Then he

in
))

So so how does it happen When
-I may as well know

VACARO
(shaking his head)
The vision comes in impressions
imagesnot the specifics you de-
sire (then) You are protected
until the first snow -- that much
is certain

JIMMY
Well shit - hell with buyin’ new
skis I guess

He laughs again this time with a manic edge

JIMMY

What a trip Planning my future
with some crazy geezer lives out
of the back of a tin can

(heading for the door)
Let me ask you -- what carnival
freak show did they fire you from

(grabs his money)
Fucking nutjob

Jimmy stumbles out Vacaro sadly watches him go

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
Jimmy puts the pedal to the floor the speedometer climbs

POV -- the deafening WHOOSH of passing cars in the opposite lane
no more than a foot from Jimmy’s fender

POV MOVING -- on the grass divider a parked motorist lays a
memorial cross and flowers to mark a highway death

Jimmy drags hard on his cigarette head reeling then eases up on
the pedal

EXT SANTA FE PLAZA - NIGHT

Jimmy and Deirdre stroll through the bustling marketplace arm in
arm She nuzzles him playful full of bounce But Jimmy looks
uneasy amidst the throngs of carefree weekenders

DIERDRE

-so can we just go up and take a
look I mean the house needs work
but it’s on ten acres In Taos

He hesitates Deirdre is miffed

DEIRDRE
Relax Jimmy I’m not picking out
china patterns

Down a side street Jimmy spots a neon sign over a tiny
storefront “PSYCHIC ADVISOR - FORTUNES” He’s struck by a
thought fishes for some money and holds it out to Deirdre

JIMMY
Why don‘t you get us some ice cream

DEIRDRE
Come with me

JIMMY
Nah I want to smoke 1I’11 be
right here go ahead

Deirdre makes a face grabs the money and heads off Jimmy waits
till she rounds the corner then heads for the shop

INT SHOP - SAME TIME

Jimmy enters the dimly lit parlor complete with beads burning
incense mystical trinkets everywhere A heavy dark-skinned
WOMAN looks up as she stubs out her cigarette

JIMMY
Hello I’dlike a reading

The Woman smiles closes a door to the adjacent room -- where a
young boy sits cross-legged in front of a TV set

THE SHOP — MINUTES LATER
The Woman is reading Jimmys palm as he looks on worriedly

WOMAN
Yes yes The Mount of Jupiter is
quite pronounced You are a hard
worker industriousand the long
xing finger represents your strong
creative abilities An Aries no

JIMMY
Taurus

WOMAN
(another look)
Of course The loops on the
fingerprints tell the tale

Jimmy is fidgety distracted

JIMMY
What aboutthe life line Is
there any way of--

She focuses on Jimmy’s wrists scrutinizing something

WOMAN
Three bracelets of lifeperhaps
fourvery deep defined

JIMMY
That’sgood

WOMAN
(smiling indicating)
Twenty-five years of life to each
bracelet That’s seventy-five

years at least -- one hundred at
most Very long life And good
health

The Woman leaps up suddenly startling Jimmy

JIMMY
What What is it

She rushes over to the now opened door where the Child stands
-holding the TV’s remote control

CHILD
Mommy this broken

The Woman hushes the boy scolding him in another language She
gently shoves him back into the room shuts the door and turns
to Jimmy apologetically

WOMAN
I am most sorry

Jimmy stands wringing his hands seemingly un-cheered by the
news of his hundred years

JIMMY
Let me ask you About fate Is
it somethingthat can be changed
(txying to articulate)
Ifif I knew something was going
to happen if I saw it coming --
could I change it

The Woman nods speaks like she’s reading from a manual

WOMAN
Each life is a unique tapestry
Some of the threads are woven
tightly cannot be altered --
these are our fate But other
strands are looser With these
our free will we weave the
story of our lives

Jimmy queasy hands the woman a twenty and heads for the door
WOMAN

Thank you Thank you very much

sir Come again
EXT SHOP - NIGHT
The shop door closes behind Jimmy as he trudges away lost in
thought -- right past Deirdre holding two vanilla cones
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
We MOVE past an alarm clock glowing 5AM Then to Deirdre
curled up asleep lightly snoring Finally we reach Jimny
awake staring at the ceiling Then--

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Still dark Jimmy in sweats pumps his arms as he scales a hill
-- running furiously soaked in sweat

Half-way up the grade he stops gasping Puts a hand to his
chest feels his hammering heart -- eyes wide with concern

INT OFFICE - DAY

A haggard Jimmy tosses aside a file unable to concentrate on it
On his desk is a dog-eared paperback the title “FORTUNE TELLING
AND DIVINATIONS - A PRACTICAL GUIDE’

His attention is suddenly drawn to something out the window--

POV - down below A familiar souped-up Silver Camaro parked on
the edge of the property Someone behind the wheel watching

Jimmy squints to be sure and we see that it’s ANDY LOPEZ the
young man he fired earlier Lopez doesn’t get out doesn’t move
Just sits and stares at the building

BACK TO Jimmy‘s troubled face

INT DOCTOR BATES’ OFFICE - DAY

Jimmy sits on the examining table The Doctor scans his

Bates fixes on

BATES
For ten years couldn’t get you in
here Now I can’t get rid of you
(puts down the folder)
So any palpitations Shortness
of breath Any pain

JIMMY
No I mean I’m not sure Some-
times I feel--
(hand to his chest)
-like I said I’m not really sure

BATES
What’s on your mind Jimmy

JIMMY
Nothing II just figured while
I’m at it I should get some more
tests Have everything checked
out To be sure

BATES
Just had your 50000 mile check-
up Looked fine

JIMMY
I’d like the 100000

Jimmy trying to read the situation

BATES
Be honest with you Jimmy it’d
be a waste of your time

JIMMY
How do you know that

BATES
Wellyour bloodwork was tops
lungs arteries clear prostate
fine No significant symptoms

that cardio-gram wasn’t intended
to panic you Just a precaution
Small nick in the armor

JIMMY
No I know

folder

BATES
And short of a head-totoe MRI
pointless in my opinion I’d say
you’re in pretty excellent shape

Jimmy shakes his head breathes heavily

The Doctor can

JIMMY
But there are things -- I get these
lumpsunder my neck Sharp head-
aches right behind my eyes Some-
times I see white spots--

BATES
You keep looking for symptoms
you’ll be in here every 48 hours

sense that Jimmy is still troubled

BATES
Look I can’t give you an absolute
guarantee on your health Ten thou-
sand things have to go right every
second for you to keep breathing-

Jimmy registers panic

JIMMY
Jesus that’s reassuring

Bates laughs punching Jimmy’s arm

BATES
Was a joke Jimmy You got more to
worry about from lightning bolts
and schmucks on the highway (beat)
Go get a drink have a cigarette--
ene And think about a vacation
Stress11 kill you quicker than any-
thing you can dream up

Jimmy nods grins uneasily No solace here either

EXT ALBUQUERQUE STREET - DAY

Jimmy carrying his sample case walks like a man under siege in

a perilous world

paranoid gaze

ANGLE as Jimmy passes an appliance store window
SHOTS plays out on rows of TV sets -- some program on airline
He turns his

head continues and--

Everything moves at halfspeed under his

A jumble of

ANOTHER ANGLE - STREET CAFE

Jimmy sips a coffee smokes Newspaper pages flap in the breeze
revealing a tabloid cover “VETERAN RAMPAGE 4 DEAD” Then--

POV - A STRANGER passes meets Jimmy’s eyes moves from the
frame Revealing--

A CIGARETTE PLACARD on a news kiosk the oversized SURGEON
GENERAL’S WARNING screaming out dire pronouncements

Jimmy steps out his smoke Grinds his teeth

A CROSSWALK - MINUTES LATER

Jaywalkers dash across the bustling avenue Jimmy approaches the
corner hesitates Presses the pedestrian ‘cross’ button

Begins cursing to himself slaps the button repeatedly

NEW ANGLE -- MINUTES LATER

Jimmy rounds a corner sees the Stranger from before lingering
near his parked car

JIMMY
Hey

Jimmy rushes over as the man hurries off
Jimmy rounds the car scrutinizing then leans down and checks
underneath Change keys and Rolaids from his breast pocket
clatter to the pavement He curses and gathers the mess up
As he stands he spots the Stranger some distance away --
fastening an ad flyer to the windshield of another car Jimmy
then sees the same flyer flapping under his own wipers

CUT TO

A BLISTERING WHITE LIGHT fills the screen Then vanishes and
reappears

We PULL BACK from the WASH to reveal the harsh beam of an
overhead projector on a conference table

INT OFFICE - DAY
Jimmy sits at the edge of the table next to Ed and some familiar
faces from the bar Roy is at the rear rapping the

temperamental projector which keeps flickering

VOICES AND SOUNDS are slurred far-off in Jimmy’s muddled mind
He squints into the flickering light mesmerized by the glare

Roy gets the projector working displaying a regional map carved
up into sales territories He addresses the group taps the
overhead again to keep it lit

MOVE in on Jimmy and his far-away eyes CLOSER as a VOICE slowly
takes focus and filters through

ROY (0S)
Jimmy Jimbo Hey do they have
Chinese food on Pluto

Laughter from the others

ED
He’s dreamin’ jukeboxes

JIMMY
snapping to)
Whuh Oh--sorry Sorry

ROY
What’s the story with Nob Hill
(reminding him)
The strip mall We got a bite on
this guy

Roy sits signaling the floor now belongs to Jimmy He stands
stabbing at his hand with a pen cap then leans on the table for
support He’s sweating heavily

JIMMY
Nob Hillthe uhhh

He loses himself in the projector light seemingly unable to
complete the thought An uncomfortable length of silence Some
of the guys snicker figuring ol’ Jimmy is up to his tricks
JIMMY
(a feeble croak)
sorry Some water please
The laughter fizzles as Jimmy holds the dazed expression
ANGLE ON Ed truly spooked
ED (0S)
You‘re shitting me
INT DINER - DAY

Ed and Jimmy sit opposite at a diner booth an incongruous green
salad in front of Jimmy Ed regards his friend with worry
ED
Tell me you’re making this up

Jimmy nervously toys with a fork

ED
Boy Jimbo you know how fucking
nuts that sounds Even for you
(a laugh erupts)
Sometrailer park Kreskin grabs
your hand tells you you’re toast
Think about that a second

JIMMY
(shaking his head)
It’s like a tune that gets stuck in
your head Wish I could forget it

Ed looks at the conviction in Jimmy’s eyes

ED
You believe this guy

JIMMY
(on his own train)
Were always so sure we’recallin’
the shots in life But what if the
script is already written We’re
just playing it out

Ed takes a bite pondering

ED
What like I wasdestined to or-
der this omelet
(eyebrow up)
Youre outta my area Jimmy but--
I was gonna get a burger

Ed finishes his food downs the rest of his coffee Leans in

ED
Obvious answer is the right one
like the cops always say (beat)
This guy’s playing you He’s a
scammer - probably a good one
Bet that was your first instinct

Jimmy nods weakly

ED
You just wait -- next thing he’il
offer to talk with the Big Guy on
your behalf erase your bad omens
First it’s hard boiled eggs under

your pillownext it’s empty out
your savings account

(shakes his head)
I’ve heard about these guys Once
they get inside your head

JIMMY
He never mentioned--

Money He’s patient Pigures
youre not the superstitious
type So this Kreskin makes a
few lucky guesses--

ED

JIMMY
Luck doesn’t explain--

ED
Bullshit You think this guy didn’t
size you upobserve every detail
Probably saw the Lobos sticker on
your bumper figured you had to have
money on the game Sawa guy with
ambition goin’ places tells you
the big windfall is just around the
corner

JIMMY
What about Dallas He knew--

ED
This fucker plays the percentages
Jimmy One guy takes the bait
another fifty he never sees again
And you -- you start looking around
finding proof under every rock

Ed holds his cup out for the waitress’ refill

ED
Youremember that highway ‘game
when you were a kid See how many
red Volkswagens you could spot on
the road (nods) You see an awful j
lot of them once you start lookin’

Jimmy raises his head Ed is making a lot of sense

ED
Cmon take this prick out of the
equation the past two weeks --
and what do you really got here

Jimmy stares at the table for a long time then pushes the hair

back from his face -- begins laughing to himself
JIMMY
Christ
ED

You’re just in a funk Dee says
you’ve barely been sleeping Why
don’t you two slip out of town for
a few days Get off this track

JIMMY
Yeah Yeah You’re right

ED

Okay Much better

(to the waitress)
Jen Bring this guy some French
fries with gravy

(mock disgust)
Cant believe you’re eating a
fucking salad--

Ed shoves the mixed greens aside then holds his hand out
ED
Hey give me a fiver I’11 tell
you your goddamn future--
Jimmy laughs easier and it feels good A ray of sunshine
pierces the gloom

EXT MOTEL NIGHT

The burning red sign up close We hear the CRACKLE OF NEON

INT MOTEL - SAME TIME

A pair of panties do lazy revolutions on the ceiling fan An
overturned champagne bottle on the nightstand A rumpled bed
empty

Jimmy weekend-bag in hand does little dance steps towards the
house Deirdre tags behind laughing He grabs the mail and
they head inside

EXT JIMMY’S BACKYARD - LATER

Jimmy sets the cordless phone on the table and cracks his beer
Takes a long cool swig holding his face to the sun Feeling
rejuvenated

The PHONE RINGS He hikes the cordless

JIMMY
Yeah

There’s that DISTANT STATIC again He listens hard trying to
decipher the sound Shrugs and clicks off

He flops into a lawn chair and sorts through the mail when a
particular envelope brings him to a halt

CLOSE ON - THE ENVELOPE It’s blank No address No postmark
He flips it over Completely unmarked

He slits it open folds out the contents a shooting-range target
bearing the silhouette of a man It’s pocked with bullet holes

DEIRDRE (0S)
--wanna go running

Jimmy is transfixed Whatever distance hed put between thoughts
of doom has been closed in an instant

THE LIVING ROOM
Deirdre pulls on a jogging shirt goes to open the door

DEIRDRE
Hey Got your ears on Jimmy

She stands in the backyard doorway puzzled A beer foaming
over sits on the table Jimmy’s nowhere in sight

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Andy Lopez shirtless and sweating mows the postage stamp of
grass in his front yard He looks up as--

Jimmy’s car pulls up to the curb and he hops out
Andy’s surprise becomes a glare as Jimmy strides over

ANDY
Hey man this is private property

JIMMY
So’s my mailbox

ANDY

Huh
Jimmy stops at a safe distance

JIMMY
Look I don’t like the way things

ANDY

JIMMY
(yelling it out)
You listening I AM NOT THE GUY

ANDY

One WORD from you and Roy would’ve
spared my ass

Jimmy is struck for a moment as the truth of that sinks in

ANDY
You fucking SOLD ME OUT -- for your
goddamn JUKEBOXES Tough shit if
that keeps you up nights
(back to his work)
Get the hell out of here

JIMMY
The harassment stops now Andy

Jimmy unfolds the target and holds it up

He taps his fingers on the sheet then folds it up and returns it
to his pocket Starts up his car and pulls out

addressing the pretty RECEPTIONIST

JIMMY

The Receptionist nods nervously

lookin’ through the discount bins
(shakes his head)

Looks like hell ninety pounds if

Jimmy pinches his nose fidgety as he stands again

MORELANE
Wasn‘’t gonna let her go but she

This stops Jimmy cold

Jimmy suddenly

JIMMY

He puts a reassuring hand on Jimmy’s shoulder

MORELANE
C‘mon let me show you the new

Jimmy exhales nods decompresses a notch They head down the
mall’s seemingly endless corridor

MORELANE
(hands clapping together)
So what’s the best deal you can
give an old pal on sixty-thousand
square feet huh

But Jimmy’s barely heard him his thoughts far off -- rearranging
puzzle pieces in his head
INT JIMMY’S STUDY NIGHT

Jimmy pours himself another scotch settles back deep into his
chair Thoughts interrupted by--

THE PHONE which he lets ring several times
He finally picks it up brings the receiver slowly up to his ear

JIMMY
Hello

The non-descript WHITE NOISE again Jimmys face tenses as he
tries to decipher it Rushing traffic on a highway Someone’s
labored breathing

JIMMY
Hello Hello
(voice wavering)
Lopez That you

Nothing He puts the receiver down spooked -- downs his drink
in a single swallow

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET DAY

Jimmy drives slowly along a once-familiar street He stops
before a dirt and gravel drive a skewed mailbox reading
‘McClure’ Kills the ignition and gets out

ANOTHER ANGLE

as Jimmy makes his way along the drive peering around the thick
growth that bends towards a house fifty yards away

NEW ANGLE as Jimmy prepares to knock on the side door He
hesitates -- and instead rounds the neglected adobe split-level
to the garden in back

He approaches the deck door leans to peek inside--when he nearly
leaps out of his Timberlands

VOICE (0S)
Hello James

Jimmy does a lightning 180 - then sucks in his breath

JIMMY
Hello Mrs McClure

POV on the birdlike woman stooped over with age and infirmity
but with a fierce glint still in her eyes

INT HOUSE - DAY

Jimmy fidgets in the cramped living room as Mrs McClure
enters with a can of Coke and a glass of ice She hands them to
him then settles herself gingerly into an easy chair

MRS MCCLURE
Never thought I’d see you on that
couch again You and Vince -- I
remember when your feet didn’t
touch the floor

JIMMY
Sorry I woke you I know you like
your afternoon nap

MRS MCCLURE
(scoffing)
Ah There’ll be plenty of time for
sleepin’ soon enough If the doc-
tor’s are half-right

JIMMY

No no-don’t say that You’re
looking weil

MRS MCCLURE
(shaking her head)
Still got a gift for the bulishit
No need kiddo I ain’t in the mar-
ket (beat) I’m dying Jimmy Got
anything to sell me for that

Jimmy sits silently cant come up with anything clever or
apropos He cracks open his Coke listens to it sizzle over the
ice cubes

MRS MCCLURE
Sowhat brings you ‘round
JIMMY’
I uh heard that Vincent was in
“town That he was taking care of
you I was hoping I might--

MRS MCCLURE
Who told you that

JIMMY
Just a friend He uh runs the
shopping center in Nob Hill

MRS MCCLURE
(suddenly recalling)
Brat Manners of a goddamn mule

An uncomfortable pause

JIMMY
You told him Vincent was here

MRS MCCLURE
(leans forward)
Know what they do to old ladies livin’
alone--‘specially ones with dizzy
spells (nods) Ship ‘em off to the
rest farmto die nice and quiet
out of everybody’s hair No thank you

Her eyes scan the cluttered living room -- a proud place
giving way to chaos

MRS MCCLURE
This place is all I got

(defiant)
And I ain’t never used a bedpan in
my life

(smiling)

So if I bent the truth a little
with your friend

A glint of relief in Jimmys eyes

JIMMY
So Vincent hasn’t been around

Mrs McClure is suddenly wary of the repeated question

MRS MCCLURE
Whos interested

JIMMY
Nobody justjust me Thought
maybe he and I could talk

slowly
MRS MCCLURE
Ah I don’t know James Vincent’s
been struggling The liquor those
goddamn drugs Got himself some
construction work doin’ his best
to keep out of trouble I don’t
think he needs to dig up any-

JIMMY
No I’m not trying to--

MRS MCCLURE
You really should’ve looked out for
him more He needed that Broke
his heart the way things turned out

JIMMY
Iwe were young And stupid If
I could turn back-

MRS MCCLURE

(a hint of acid)
You weren’t stupid Jimmy

(a smile returns)
I got a good feeling this time
Vincent knows he won’t have me
around much longer (beat) First
time in his life he’1l be alone

JIMMY
(still fishing)
So he hasn’t been in town since--

MRS MCCLURE
(clipped suspicious)
That would be violating his parole

wouldn’t it They like to keep ‘em
on a short leash the first six months

A KETTLE BOILS in the adjacent kitchen and Mrs McClure
struggles to her feet

MRS MCCLURE
You sure I can’t fix you something
Got some nice cold cuts this morning

JIMMY
No no thank you (then) You think
I couldhave a look at Vince’s
old room This placeholds a lot
of memories

MRS MCCLURE
(wary thend)

You know where it is

INT VINCENT’S BEDROOM - DAY

The door swings open and Jimmy steps in eyes roaming over the
past Led Zeppelin posters shelves stacked with adventure books
a corkboard with tacked-up photos A boy’s room frozen in time

pov CLOSE on some of the photos One of Vincent and Jimmy as
teens grinning arm-in-arm graduation robes flapping

Jimmy smiles in remembrance but it soon fades as he sees--

POV ANOTHER PHOTO -- Vince a bit older aims an imposing rifle
at some distant target

Jimmy’s eyes sweep the dead-quiet room satisfied that nothing’s
out of place He turns to go when his feet kick something
protruding from under the bed His face tightens as he sees--
A pair of work boots surrounded by crumbs of caked mud

CUT TO
Jimmy’s feet hustling down the stairs into--
THE FOYER

Mrs McClure begins chattering having heard Jimmy come down --
but he’s not listening He wipes his damp brow looking queasy

Atop a commode he spots a stack of letters neatly bound with a
rubber band He takes a closer look

CLOSE ON THE TOP ENVELOPE The return address from Vincent a
residence in Oklahoma All the letters bearing the same address

He slides a letter out from the middle of the stack slips it
into a pocket He hears Mrs McClure’s nattering from the
kitchen and suddenly the urge to flee becomes overpowering

Jimmy rushes for the door unlocks it and bolts out

INT JIMMY’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

Jimmy loosens his tie sweating heavily Looks down at the
letter in his hand leans his head on the steering wheel

JIMMYS CAR- LATER

Now cruising on the empty highway mumbling into his cellphone

JIMMY
Thing is I’m sittin’ here in crazy
trafficyeah looks like a tractor-
trailer kinda situation--real ugly
yeahuh huhnext week would be
ideal Okay then Yep Bye now

cuT TO

CLOSE ON - JIMMY’S ANSWERING MACHINE Counter reads ‘4’ His
finger reaches in presses the replay button BEEP CLICK
BEEP CLICK BEEP Four hang-ups

ANGLE ON - JIMMY’S FACE real fear there for the first time

INT JIMMYS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jimmy flicks the blade of a knife out -- cuts away at the
yellowed tape sealing a cardboard box He spills the contents on
the table before him

CLOSE on the mess as Jimmy sifts through it Stuff hastily
packed and long forgotten Heaps of receipts contracts blue-
prints -- along with a scattering of loose PHOTOGRAPHS Jimmy
gathers the pictures together

He flips through several of the photos until one stops him--

POV - two boys in cowboy hats holding miniature pick-axes --
like a pair of mining prospectors Gap toothed grins

Another few photos then--

CLOSE ON - THE BACK OF A PICTURE Scribbledin ink ‘The Sun
Kings” He turns it around and we see two men in their mid 20s--
Vincent and Jimmy Wearing tuxedoes and exuberant smiles
toasting with champagne Two guys ready to take on the world

CLOSER ON - VINCENT His face is obscured by harsh shadows
features barely perceptible apart from the ‘wide grin

Jimmy stares at the photo with somber eyes holding back a flood
of memory -- then forces his mind on as he always does Reaches
for the phone

EXT THE FIREHOUSE PUB - NIGHT

Jimmy leans on the hood of his car as Ed’s Impala pulls up
alongside Ed gets out Behind them the neon of the pub
flickers beckoning

ED
Late night phone calls Meetings
in dark parking lots

JIMMY

ED

plaints -- asked me if you’re hav-
ing personal problems

shaking his head)
Told me he laid out a hundred grand

ED

ED

ED
(an eyebrow up)
This doesn’t have anything to do

‘Cause if it does--

JIMMY
No Some personal shit

ED
What’s in Oklahoma

Ed senses Jimmy’s unease He nods back toward the pub

ED
What do you say we grab a few

He looks at Jimmy’s stone-face for a moment

Jimmy snorts

Jimmy kicks at

JIMMY
-No The whole fucking crew is in
there and--

ED
Would you characterize our thing
here as a‘close friendship’
JIMMY

Close as two adult males probably

ED
Then as a close friend it’s my
duty to voice my uhh profound
concern over this recent tack--

JIMMY
(impatient)
You gonna cover me or not

ED
Quit snowing the snowman What

agitated Pinally--

JIMMY
That target in my mailbox Lopez
may not be the guy

ED
Ah you see--you see now What

going on

the dirt grits his teeth--then finally relents

I think it’s a Valentine from an
old buddy of mine Just got par-
oled from Creedmore

ED
Phew Home for errant boy scouts

JIMMY
We had a business together bunch
of years back Things kinda went
sour He did some time got all

Ed lights up a

ED
This guy violent

JIMMY
Not back then -- but I figure he’s

‘seen some rough miles In and out

of a lot of jails Everybody’s
heard a story it seems

cigarette trying to process all this

ED
That’s a long time to wait to set-
tle an old score I mean how do

JIMMY
Makes sense His mom’s real sick
I think he’s been slipping into
town to see her (beat) Maybe he’s
tying up loose ends or something

ED

fuck with him like you did Lopez

JIMMY
He’s not going to know Im there
Strictly reconnaissance

cop Call his parole officer

JIMMY
And tell them what I can’t prove

got ideas (beat) I gotta do
something

Ea pushes off from the car walks a nervous circle

ED
Thisthis is fucking crazy Guy
could be a major nutjob-

JIMMY

- What do you suggest Wait around

for him to use me as target practice
Call him up and ask “hey did you
by chance put a threat in my mailbox’

He tosses his beeper to Ed who catches it
JIMMY
Goddammit this is serious -- this
is real shit here Help me out

Ed sighs pockets the beeper signaling to Jimmy he’s agreed

EXT HIGHWAY - POST DAWN

Were down low on a ribbon of asphalt stretching into oblivion
The stillness is shattered by Jimmy’s Camry blasting by

HIGHWAY - LATER

Jimmy slows for an intersection light A tattered HITCHHIKER
sidles up to the car jerking his thumb towards the horizon
Jimmy quickly reaches over locks the passenger door button

EXT MOTELHOSTEL - LATE MORNING

A row of standalone pre-fab cabins the type catering to monthly
transients

Jimmy’s car is parked in the near-empty lot At the far end sits
a shack with a sign reading ‘MANAGEMENT OFFICE‘ Inside the
office a geezer is lost in his newspaper
INT JIMMY’S CAR - SAME TIME
Fingers nervously drum the wheel
JIMMY (OS)
(on his phone)
Cabin one thirty five please

CLOSE ON - JIMMYS CELL PHONE pressed against his ear We hear
RINGING No answer He hangs up

CLOSE ON - THE DASH CLOCK Eleven twenty in the morning

Jimmy slips on his shades presses a baseball hat down and pops
his door

EXT MOTELHOSTEL - SECONDS LATER

Jimmy heads for a cabin near the end of the row trying to be
nonchalant and failing miserably

Arriving at the cabin he slinky to a side-window cups his

Pe

hands
POV - a gap in the drawn curtain affords only a limited view

He steps back considers his options Late morning lull -- it’s
dead around here He pulls out his wallet eyes the assortment
of plastic selects his American Express card

CABIN ENTRANCE

Jimmy feigns tying a shoe-lace by the door doing a sweep of the
perimeter ending at the cheap doorknob He goes for it

CLOSE ON - THE DOOR FRAME Jimmy’s Amex card saws its way into
the crack trying to get at the latch He’s no pro - and the
longer this goes the more frantic he becomes

Hes about to cut his losses when the door CLICKS open He darts
inside

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

He peeks out the window stiff with fear No-one’s the wiser
He turns scanning the cluttered dwelling

Clothes scattered Dishes heaped up The only sound is the
restless drip of the KITCHEN TAP ticking like a clock

He scurries across the room races through a few drawers finds
nothing out of the ordinary

On the nightstand a few skin mags and a self-help paperback
“MENDING THE PAST” He flips the book’s pages finding two
joints tucked inside

A thought strikes him He slips his hand under the mattress
groping Suddenly he gasps holding his index finger

CLOSE ON - HIS FINGER A drop of bloed blooms from the tip

He licks off the blood lifts the mattress ‘finding a small kit
with a needle poking out He opens the zipper revealing a
syringe glassine envelope and some crystal pills in a clear
bag Zips the pouch back up

And then he notices something else further under the mattress
Dark metal He reaches for it A full barrel 38

He’s unable to remove his eyes from the cold steel Is he
holding his own murder weapon He unlocks the tumbler shakes
one of the bullets out Stares at it a long time

He slips the bullet back snaps the tumbler in place and pockets
the gun Decides he’s seen enough Halfway to the door he

hesitates pulls the gun back out Unsure now

Just as he returns the gun to its hiding place he hears the
Gistinct sound of BOOTS approaching outside

Jimmy is frozen with panic

We MOVE IN lightning-fast on the doorknob JANGLING KEYS A
key enters the lock the sound deafening Suddenly--

Jimmy grabs the knob holds onto the latch with his fingers not
allowing it to turn with the key The person outside tries
harder Jimmy holds on gritting his teeth

CURSING from the person outside as he pushes against the door
jiggles the lock violently A muffled growl of annoyance

The door is given a hard kick and the key is snatched from the
lock BOOTS retreat

Jimmy dares not move He notices the window to his right
darkening and squeezes up to the wall The silhouette peering
in finally withdraws

Jimmy finds it hard to let go of the lock petrified even to
breathe The FOOTSTEPS fade across the lot Jimmy stretches to
the window---

POV - from the back we see a Man in a flannel shirt and
construction boots stomping towards the management office

EXT CABIN - SECONDS LATER

The moment the Man enters the office Jimmy flies out of the
cabin and races for his car He jumps in

INT JIMMY’S CAR - SAME TIME

He fumbles with his keys drops them in the foot well As he
finally gets the car started we see two people exiting the
management office in the bg

Jimmy’s a tad too eager pulling out making the tires yelp--then
stalling out the car He frantically tries to re-start the
engine finally coughing to life

EXT MOTELHOSTEL - SECONDS LATER

POV - Jimmy’s Camry races away from us swerves onto the road and
speeds away

i

INT JIMMY’S CAR - SAME TIME

He pounds the wheel cursing his stupidity and a LOUD HORN sounds
as he nearly side-swipes a car

He pulls to the roadside faint with the after-shock of his
ordeal breathing like a madman

HOLD then--

CLOSE ON - THE PHOTOGRAPH from Jimmys basement The words “Sun
Kings” scrawled on the flip side We PULL BACK to reveal--

)

INT FIREHOUSE PUB - NIGHT

Ed scrutinizes the picture holding it at another angle

ED
This the best you got Can hardly
see the sonofabitch’s face

He holds it out to Jimmy

JIMMY
Just hang on to itin case

ED
In case what No way Jimbo
You’re getting mixed up in some-
thingand I’m not going to be
part of it half in the dark No
fucking way

(lights a cigarette)

I’m either all in or all out

Jimmy thinks about this slides the photo back to Ed Breathes
hard ready to unearth what he’s worked so hard to bury

JIMMY

All of thisstays local got me

(Ed nods his agreement)
Like I said me and Vince were in
business a while back Set up this
little import-export gig mostly low-
end shit--toys cheap sunglasses
kinda crap you see on those super-
market racks Figured it was our
short-cut to the big pool

Ea sees Jimmy’s hand trembling as he fiddles with a shot glass

JIMMY
Routed the stuff for some reps in
Mexico City And--

(voice drops a notch)
we both knew the whole gig reeked
ofsomething It was all too
fucking easy But the green start-
ed rolling in and well ignorance
being bliss-

ED
These guys washing a little money

JIMMY
Vince was never one for sharing the
details but I guess it was obvious
Anyway one day these suits show up
flashin’ FBI badges Announced we
were in a world of shit

ED
(eyes raised)
Wow Far out

JIMMY
Got us in separate rooms started
tightening the screws My guy said
Vince had come clean laid it all
out for them Suggested I do the
same

ED
And you did

JIMMY
Seems they were gunning for Vince
anyway -- knew he was the point man

Had a pile of wire transfers with
his name on them

(shakes his head)
SoSsix months probation for yours
truly Vince’s defender cut him a
deal skipped trial Three years
in the clink

JIMMY

Went off to jail grinnin’ like he
had to prove he wasn’t afraid Like
it was all some big joke (beat)
Stupid fuck - good behavior could’ve
been out of there in a year

(grave silence)
We never talked again

ED
Heavy shit Jimbo

A silence as Jimmy stares at his drink rolling it in the glass

(changing gears)
Well if this guy’s got loaded guns I
and a junk kit stashed under his
bed those are serious parole in-
fractions right

as Jimmy nods)
Call his parole officer End it now

JIMMY
shaking his head)
Not going to tip him off But if
he makes a move

Ed pours Jimmy‘’s untouched drink into his downs them both

ED
Past is the past kid Think it’s
time to get back on track

JIMMY i

She yanks the blanket from the bed grabs her pillow and shoves
past him Jimmy deflates his gaze settling on the pathetic
boning knife in his hand

INT POLICE STATIONBACK OFFICE DAY

Jimmy fidgets in a chair across from SARGEANT VAN MEER The cop
raises an eyebrow puts down a printout

VAN MEER
Quite a sheet on your friend here
So this guy starts calling you out
of the clear blue after what--

JIMMY
About seven years

VAN MEER
Must’ve been some falling out
Any idea why he’d contact you

JIMMY
No I meanI did pay his mother
a visit when I heard he might be
in town But that was to--

VAN MEER
Wait a second you went to see his
mother So you were looking for him

JIMMY
No I was--

VAN MEER
He probably assumed you wanted to
get in touch
(growing impatient)
Mr Munson has this man actually
made threats

JIMMY
Not in so many words It’s more
what he’s implying

VAN MEER
Doesn’t quite sound like harassment
But since he’s got a history I’1l
put in a call to his PO -- make
sure they’ve got a sharp eye on him
Thats all I can do

JIMMY
(blurting it)
I think he might be using again
He had a prettyserious habit

Se

ca

VAN MEER
(eyeing Jimmy)

You have any evidence of that

Jimmy thinks better of it shakes his head Van Meer gathers

INT MRS MCCLURE’S HOUSE DAY

Mrs McClure potters to the kitchen in

an old flowery robe

followed by Jimmy The place is getting bare like a museum
packing up and shutting its doors forever

JIMMY
Sorry I skipped out las

t time A

little overwhelmed I guess

MRS MCLURE

Wasted a perfectly good soda

They arrive in the kitchen where dozens of boxes are being

packed and labeled -- all the treasure
is littered with dusty wine bottles
wiping them clean

MRS MCCLURE

s of a lifetime The table
Mrs McClure sits begins

Can I fix you something A sand-

wich maybe

JIMMY
No thanks I--

MRS MCCLURE
(smiling sadly)

Was saving all these for the right
occasions Guess there were plenty--

just didn’t seem so at
She hands a bottle to Jimmy

MRS MCCLURE

much about it but

JIMMY
(suddenly)

Maggie I’m worried about Vincent

MRS MCCLURE

JIMMY

got the feeling he’sthinkin’ of
doing something stupid

MRS MCCLURE
Stupid Like what He on those
damn drugs again

JIMMY
I think maybe if you called him
talked some senseit might set
him straight

She suddenly slumps over begins hacking violently for breath i
Jimmy mortified stretches out a hand She waves it away
finally regains herself Talks as if nothing had happened

Jimmy turns ashen kneads his hands nervously

Jimmy is stiff

Jimmy drifts towards the front door dazed She follows him

MRS MCCLURE
I can’t call him Jimmy

JIMMY i
Why not

MRS MCCLURE
He’s gone to Cimmaron with his
parole program Theyre digging
ditches for those flood victims --
isn’t that wonderful

MRS MCCLURE ie
I wish I’d been awake when he left
the message Said he loved me ‘
Doesn’t say that too often

with dread Mrs McClure pulls her robes tighter

MRS MCCLURE i
Getting real cold out there

JIMMY

JIMMY
Thank you Maggie i

As he steps onto the porch

MRS MCCLURE
Jimmy You forgot your wine
(hands it to him)
Don’t wait too long to open it

Jimmy stands regarding the bottle Then A VOICE one we’ve
heard recently Sergeant Van Meer

VAN MEER (0S)
seems Mr McClure failed to
report in to his parole officer
But with his type of recidivism
this is fairly routine Probably
off on another bender

INT JIMMYS STUDY - EVENING
Jimmy paces agitated phone in hand

JIMMY
So what you’re saying is you won’t
do anything until this guy shows up
at my door and puts a goddamn bul-
let in me

Jimmy slams down the phone head reeling

SERIES OF SHOTS as Jimmy locks down the house

- Jimmy knocks several flowerpots over as he shoves a stubborn

window closed secures the latch

- He slides the safety chain on the front door Bolts the back

Pushes a heavy table against the rickety patio entrance

- Jimmy nails plywood over a shattered window in the garage

- Blinds being lowered More latches thrown Doorknobs checked

JIMMY’S STUDY - LATER

Jimmy at his laptop removes his glasses and rubs the bridge of
his nose It’s late

RAIN chatters on the window DISTANT RUMBLING flashes of
LIGHTNING

He goes to the bar-cart under the window pours himself a scotch
And as he tilts his head back to drink--

POV - outside the window lit in a strobe of lightning is a
hulking SILHOUETTE hefting a rifle The WINDOW EXPLODES and--

Jimmy crashes back clutching his throat which fountains blood and
we--

SHOCK CUT TO
EXTREME CLOSE - a WHIRL OF BEDSHEETS being flung aside and--

We FOLLOW a pair of bare feet racing over the carpet down the
hall and into a room where--

LIGHTS GO ON in JIMMY’S STUDY -- the room we were just in
Jimmy in boxers scans the room face flushed and sweating

POV - The scotch tumbler is empty Computer off Window intact
Deirdre runs in moments later

DEIRDRE
What What is it

Apprehensive he inches up to the rain-streaked window
REVERSE ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

Jimmy’s face pressed up against the glass- Hands cupped
squinting into the rain-fouled night ‘To his horror he spots--

Bootprints in the muddy ground pooled with water

He reels from the window back against the wall And in the
doorway Deirdre stands incredulous

JIMMY
Somebody’s out there There are
are footprints

Deirdre comes closer spooked -- but mostly by Jimmy

yee

WW

JIMMY
No don’t--

DEIRDRE
Cut it out

She slaps his hand away puts her face to the window Then
deflates and turns to Jimmy

DEIRDRE
I cleaned the windows yesterday
remember Those are my prints--
from the goddamn hose

Jimmy digests that lets his defenses down a notch

DETRDRE
Jimmywhat’s going on

JIMMY

pening to you (beat) I want to help

He locks eyes with her on this last comment

EXT HIGHWAY - MORNING

LOW ANGLE - THE ROAD racing at us in the harsh glare of morning
We fly past a grizzled carcass on the shoulder

INT CAR - SAME TIME

DEIRDRE
What am I supposed to think
You’reliving your life by what
some crackpot fortune teller said

JIMMY
What happens when that crackpot is
right about everything

DETRDRE
I’d say he’s a pretty good guesser

JIMMY
Maybe you don’t know what the fuck

DETRDRE

lem answering a direct question

DETRDRE
(with a sigh)
Whatever you say Jimmy

EXT PARKING LOTTAVERN - DAY

Jimmy hops out of his car scans the lot The spot last
inhabited by Vacaro’s camper is now empty

JIMMY
He was right here Right here

Deirdre watches silently not sure what to think Jimmy heads
for the nearby tavern then is stopped by--

POV - A VENDORS CART Lined with hundreds of ceramic figurines
including rows of identical JACKALOPES

INT BAR - MINUTES LATER

Jimmy with Deirdre in tow moves for the bar He flags the
Bartender who ambles over

BARTENDER
A lot of comin’ and goin’ around

weeks at a time
(remembering)
Hey Marcy

BARTENDER

Deirdre a glimmer of hope
BARTENDER

Listen about that Wurlitzer How
much do you think-

But Jimmy is already half-way out the door

INT JIMMY’S CAR - EVENING

Deirdre slips on her seat belt Jimmy is going too fast
agitated overheating Close to coming unhinged

DEIRDRE
Abiquiu is two hours Can’t we--

Hes

JIMMY
(checking his rearview)
That fucker’s been on our ass since
Espanola You notice that

pov - REARVIEW A set of headlights creeps up on them

Jimmy curses then reaches under his seat comes up holding the
38 he’d bought earlier Deirdre‘s eyes go white

DEIRDRE
Jimmy JESUS whered you--

JIMMY
What You think I’m going to rely
on the cops

DEIRDRE
Put that away You know how I
feel--

JIMMY
Get down

Jimmy grips the weapon as the headlights overtake his car The
vehicle behind inches up and as it does--

Pov - two travelers in ridiculous hats nod a hello to Jimmy as
they blow past him

DEIRDRE
PUT IT AWAY

Jimmy flustered finally listens Deirdre catches her breath

DEIRDRE
Jimmy it’s time you got help
This isn’t funny anymore

Jimmy suddenly begins chuckling Deirdre is freaked

DEIRDRE
This is amusing

JIMMY
The first snow The old man said
I was safe till the first snow
Its okay We’re okay

Deirdre softens tries a different tack

DEIRDRE
Youre going to live to be on old
fart just like your Dad This
fortune teller -- it’s gotta be

some kind of sick joke

JIMMY
(hasn’t heard her)
Bet I could get away with anything
till that first snow Step out in
front of a truck -- it would swerve
last second It would have to
Jump out a tenth story window

An idea suddenly strikes him He shuts the car’s lights off
PITCH BLACK The straight stretch of highway vanishes

DEIRDRE
JIMMY

JIMMY
Relax relax Were okay baby
Nothing’s going to hurt us

Deep in the distance a set of headlights grows nearer

DEIRDRE
STOP FUCKING AROUND

The headlights approach begin to blind us Just as they seem to
swallow us up--the oncoming car ROARS past HORN BLARING
Jimmys way over the yellow line

Deirdre begins flailing at Jimmy with clumsy blows It snaps him
out of his stupor

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The car screeches on the shoulder Deirdre storms out Jimmy
following Tears are streaming down her face her arms hugging
her shoulders

JIMMY
Hey kid I’m sorry--I didn’t

Deirdre explodes in a fury as Jimmy attempts to embrace her

DEIRDRE
Youre a maniac You’re sick

JIMMY
C’mon get back in the car Please

She considers for a moment -- then wipes her eyes sticks out her
thumb to an approaching pickup

JIMMY
Dee

The truck slows for her Deirdre leans in explaining something
to the driver She regards Jimmy then gets in the pickup --
which pulls a U-turn and speeds off Jimmy watches the tail-
lights vanish into the night

EXT ABIQUIU CAMPGROUNDS - DAWN

Late-autumn desolate Trees stretch and dance in the wind
sweeping off the lake Jimmy’s car seems to rise from the
landscape as it draws near

INT JIMMY’S CAR - SAME TIME

He’s forward in his seat scanning the terrain Suddenly his
exhausted eyes hone in The car stops idles Then--

POV - deep in the distance a yellow square of window-light

Jimmy reaches to the dash and kills the headlights

EXT VACARO’S CAMPER - MINUTES LATER

Jimmy slips out of the scrub and inches towards the door He
braces a moment then watches the door sway lazily open in the
breeze He steps up cautiously

INT RV - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy ‘finds Vacaro at the table mending a trout lure He looks
up -- distressed though not particularly surprised

VACARO
Mr Munson (beat) Do you fish

Jimmy slumps against the wall waiting for Vacaro to say more

JIMMY
I’m here Goddammit you got me
all the way out here What
what do I need to do

VACARO
I don’t understand

JIMMY
What is the game Youyou want
money from me to erase the curse
(laughs nervously)

That it I mean -- you gotta give
me the punchline

Fear flickers across Vacaro’s face as Jimmy pulls out the 38
and approaches He rests the gun on the table sits opposite him

JIMMY
You see I don’t know the rules
here Tell me the rules

VACARO
Im afraid I don’t--

Jimmy lashes out instinctively smacking the old man with the
gun A trickle of blood’ runs from his lip

JIMMY
How far are you going to take it
I mean WHEN DOES IT END

Jimmy points the pistol Vacaro reaches slowly for it

VACARO
(leaning in)
We both know you won’t use that
Please hand it to me

JIMMY
Saw that in my future did you
MaybeI’11 blow your brains out
anyway show you I can change the
script -- anytime I want

Vacaro’s hand is almost at the trembling barrel now Jimmy’s
finger pressures the trigger

Jimmy quivers with strain as Vacaro’s fingers close around the
weapon -- gently twisting it free then resting it on the table

JIMMY
(deflating near tears)
I’ve got a little money Maybe
I can get some more Just make it
stop -- tell me what to do

VACARO
I want nothing from you Mr Munson
I ama retired farmer with an imper-
fect gift It pays for food gas --
but I have no other needs

The realization crashes over Jimmy and he begins sobbing

JIMMY
You shouldn’t have told me

pom

oo

VACARO
I am sorry I did But youd have
persisted until you knew It is
in your nature

A flicker of hope suddenly lights Jimmy’s eyes

JIMMY
I could take precautions if I
knew Whenhow
(reaching out his hand)
You can see that can’t you

VACARO
Your fate lies on whatever road
you choose Even if you choose
to run from it

JIMMY

I I read in this booka gypsy told
this woman her dog was gonna be run
over It was destined So the lady
started bein’ real careful tyin’

the dog up and everything (beat)

And it never happened She changed
the future Itmust be possible

VACARO
Who’s to say Mr Munson

JIMMY

(hand out again)
You‘ve got to tell me

(on Vacaro’s silence)
Its my friend isn’t it A friend
from the past He thinks I fucked
him over -- he’s coming to even
things up

VACARO
(eyebrow lifted)
You see more than you think

Jimmy rises mind racing Vacaro dabs at his bloody mouth

JIMMY
There’s got to be a way to slip
through Maybe -- it’s some kind

of test A debt I have to clear
Then I get my future back Could-
n’t that be it

VAI
These are not ters for men to

ee

oo

decide Go live your life There
‘are still things you can change

JIMMY
(teeth gritted)
Shouldnt have told me

VACARO
Think of all those who departed this
life without warning -- you might
have been one of them In some
ways youve been blessed

JIMMY
laughs bitterly)
BLESSED

VACARO
To live without blinders To
prepare -- for a good death

Jimmy gives a hard stare retrieves the gun and moves far the
door He looks back

JIMMY
I don’t want a good death I want
to live And Im not gonna lie down--
I don’t care who’s decided for me

He shoves the door open steps into the growing daylight outside

INT SERVICE STATIONMARKET - DAY

Jimmy hands the cashier some money is unnerved by a strange
smile on the clerk’s face He looks back over his shoulder

POV outside Jimmy’s car sits at the pump gas nozzle still
attached And drifting down on the scene is a faint almost
imperceptible scattering of SNOWFLAKES
Jimmy’s face goes white as he shuffles towards the door
CLERK (0S)

Sir Your change
EXT SERVICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
Jimmy quickens the pace towards his car nearly knocking over a

kid who’s staring wondrously up at the snow He brushes flakes
from his arm as if they were corrosive acid

He jumps into his Camry struggles to get it started slams the
wheel in anger The car ROARS to life and Jimmy shifts into
gear ignoring--

VOICE (0S)

yanked from his tank and clatters to the blacktop

INT JIMMY’S HOUSE - EVENING

couch knees together Ed’s by the bar drink in hand

Heaviness in the air

Ed puts down the glass fixes Jimmy with a serious eye

ED
Tell you the truth Jimbo -- we’re

DEIRDRE
Remember what you said about your

how you could never reach him

spins to face her)
This isn’t a nervous breakdown
This is happening There’s an ex-
con stoved up on smack and revenge -
and he’s on his way here with a
loaded gun as we sit here talking
BULLSHIT

Ed appears in the doorway Jimmy continues packing

ED
You really believe that

Jimmys about to answer when headlights sweep across the window
blinds He leaps into action switches off the light and peers
through the slats Tense seconds then--

Jimmy turns to

JIMMY
We can’t stay here

ED
(calling after him)
Ignorant bliss is highly under-
‘rated my friend

DEIRDRE
Jimmy -- where are you going

But he’s already gone trailed by the slamming door

FADE IN FROM BLACK

We TRACK along a dimly lit room spotting a rumpled bed --
littered with dozens of unopened cans of food

We continue on to the night table where a 38 pistol lies next
to the phone -- the chord dangling out of its jack

Finally we reach Jimmy haggard and unshaven peering out through
the blinds into the harsh sunlight Hears something and--

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Jimmy rushes to the TV and turns up the volume--
POV - THE SCREEN an ANNOUNCER gestures before a regional map

ANNOUNCER
-and continuing clear skies and
high temps in the Albuquerque region
despite scattered flurries earlier
in the week Bad news for skiers

Jimmy returns to the door checks on a chair wedged under the
knob Double checks the lock and safety chain Paces over the
green shag carpet in the cramped dingy room

LATER

Jimmy is still pacing carrying the plugged-in phone receiver to
his ear

VAN MEER (0S)
Same thing I told you this morn-
ing -- he was spotted on a security
camera two days ago holding up a
Texaco An APB’s gone out on the
wire -- he’s not gonna get far

JIMMY
So basically nobody’s got a
fucking clue where he iswhere
he’s going

VAN MEER (0S)

(getting steamed)
Mr Munson he robbed a gas station
near Tulsa That means he’s prob-
ably traveling away from your
vicinity Now those folks down
there are handling it and I’d
appreciate it if you’d let us--

Jimmy slams down the phone Seized with anger he rips the chord
from the wall

LATER
Strips of daylight through the blinds A CAR DOOR slams VOICES

Jimmy barrels out of the bathroom holding his pants up He
spies out the window

LATER

Jimmy is sprawled on the bed A BACKFIRE from the parking lot
tears him from his slumber Heleaps up - regains himself
shakes his head to clear it

At the nighttable he pops a No-Doz from its foil Turns up the
TV’s volume to blaring

LATER

In the dark the glow of the 24-hour Weather Channel The same
updates on an endless loop

Jimmy sits back against the wall rocking mumbling The
solitary confinement beginning to feast on his sanity It’s
unclear how many days he’s been in here

LATER

A plastic fork stabs at Gry flaking tuna He doesn’t have the
stomach tosses it in the trash with a heap of empty cans

Another NoDoz is pressed out
LATER

Through the darkness a single snowflake floats down in swirling
hypnotic spirals Then another and another and--

A terrible SCREAM tears the stillness and--

Jimmy launches off the bed shrieking -- trips over something and
crashes to the floor

Someone BANGS on the DOOR now
Jimmy trains his gun Wild eyed a week’s worth of beard

VOICE (0S)
What’s goin’ on in there

Jimmy cocks the gun The BANGING continues pushing him to the
edge He extends the 38 bracing for the explosion

JIMMY
GO AWAY I’LL SHOOT

The BANGING ceases Aching stillness

Finally he dares to the window peeping out the slats with
nervous bloodshot eyes

POV OUTSIDE A hint of desolate dawn Snowfree
LATER

Jimmy falls to his knees and begins to sob A deep racking that
reaches down into his soul

Crumbling from the insides out he flops against the wall Be-
yond exhaustion beyond hope without respite He looks down--

CLOSE ON - THE GUN We holdand holdthen--

Jimmy as the horrible thought begins to build Trembling he
lifts the gun to his temple Can’t make himself do it Shifts
the gun which now points at his heart

JIMMY
--can change the script anytime
I want

Prom

He begins laughing the irony of the situation dawning He
returns the gun to his head bites down squints -- and theres a
long moment where the disparate forces in him do battle

Finally he lets the gun drop - gasping unable to cry The
urge to live wins Then -- he is mesmerized by something out of
frame

POV - THE BLINDS as something dances and flickers behind them
Jimmy struggles up makes a peephole in the blinds And outside--

POV - the SNOW has begun to fall Heavy wet flakes a thick
layer already coating the tarmac

Jimmy turns looks at the gun on the carpet His eyes hold in
them the blank terror of the place he has just passed through
INT MOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER

CLOSE ON - THE DOOR LOCK Being undone The chain slipped off
From behind we see Jimmy opening the door The light outside
burns everything a shimmering white

EXT MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy emerges the gaunt prisoner 38 in hand He regards the
falling snow for a few moments then steps out into it

He lifts his face lets the flakes cover him cleanse him
Feeling their cold fresh sting all the way to his marrow

Jimmy moves further into the parking lot -- suddenly looking tiny
against the surrounding blanket of white Tears come then
laughter as a calm resignation takes hold -- the futility of

running any more

The gun slips from his hand as he walks further away from us --
finally being swallowed up by the blinding’whiteness

INT JIMMY’S HOUSE DAY
Tomb-like then--

The front door opens and Jimmy enters bag in hand He stops
center room gazing about Lets the bag drop

SERIES OF SHOTS

--Blinds being yanked up letting the sun back in

--The patio door shoved open the breeze making curtains dance
--Wilted plants receive water

--Jimmy in a steaming shower

--In EXTREME CLOSE-UP a razor cuts through old stubble

THE KITCHEN

Jimmy regards the real-estate clipping on the fridge The house
and land in Taos Pulls the clipping off

THE STUDY

Jimmy stares at the answering machine the frantic light blinking
‘37 He presses ‘CLEAR’ and they are gone Then takes the
machine disconnects it and drops it in the trash

EXT JIMMY’S HOUSE DAY

Jimmy stretches back on a lawnchair in jeans and a summer shirt
A serenity about him now The patio around him is covered with
snow

He takes a sip from his wine glass Mrs McClure’s opened bottle
on the table beside him

POV - Clouds sail past in a robin’s egg-blue sky A kid in the
next yard flails around in the powder A mailman trudges along
his daily route

There is an almost surreal feel to the world Hyper-clear
Every image and sound razor sharp

He lights a cigarette Inhales deeply savoring the smoke Gut
unclenched completely in the moment

The cordless PHONE RINGS Several times Jimmy reaches for it

(hands him a duffel)
You kiddin’ me These guys are ex-
gamblers -- pals of Meyer Lansky
Greenbacks only preferably in a
black leather suitcase

(as the Manager grins)
Don’t think they trust us desert
rats

They share a laugh as the Manager rises heads to the vault

Ed chews on that for a moment

Huh It’s not end of month

JIMMY

The Bartender dips behind the register and pulls out a sheaf
Jimmy counts out the bills and lays them down

JIMMY
Hey Sam - you’re an amazing barman
- know that
BARTENDER
Huh
JIMMY

Just wanted to say it I’ve really
enjoyed your work over the years

BARTENDER
(first time ever)
Ubhthanks

Jimmy knocks twice on the bar turns and heads out -- glancing
back at what has been his home away from home Sammy assesses
his domain stands a little taller
—

By the door he spots a veteran barfly searching his palm for
some jukebox change Jimmy fishes out a twenty feeds it into
the juke then pats the oldster on the back

JIMMY
Play a few for me willya

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

A HITCHHIKER even more Manson-esque than the earlier ones
raises his thumb Runs alongside Jimmy’s car as it slows

HITCHER
‘preciate it man Tryin’ to get
to Colorado before--

The Hitcher glances in the window Jimmy calmly staring ahead
The tote stuffed full of cash lying on the passenger seat
Thinks a second then--

HITCHER
You knowI could really use the
exercise--

Jimmy shrugs and tears off

EXT ANDY LOPEZ’S HOUSE DAY
Andy opens the door surprised to see Jimmy

ANDY

Jimmy slips the yellow wire receipt into a folder -- then holds
the folder out to Andy

Andy stunned watches Jimmy hurry off

EXT JIMMY’S HOUSE - EVENING

Jimmy gets out of his car struck at the sight of Deirdre emer-
ging from the house bag in hand They stop regard each other

DEIRDRE

Heard you wereout of jail

(Jimmy nods)
dust came by to get some clothes
Headin’ home for a week - Dads

(a long silence)
WellI gotta go

She moves for her car Jimmy stops her -- holds her dearly She
resists then begins crying burying her face on his shoulder

INT JIMMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room in shambles the aftermath of make- -up sex Dee lies on
Jimmys chest laughs to herself

DEIRDRE
This feels likean affair

Jimmy stares up at the fan something on his mind

JIMMY

at those ten acres Sick of paying
rent on this place

Poa

DEIRDRE

Deirdre is overjoyed speechless She squeals smothers Jimmy
with kisses

JIMMY

DEIRDRE

Jimmy kisses her hard pulls her closer

EXT TRAIN STATION - DAY
Jimmy and Deirdre say goodbye on the snow-coated platform

DEIRDRE
See ya Wednesday stud Don’t

He kisses her again doesnt want to let go Watches her brown
hair tossing around in the wind

DEIRDRE
Gonna miss my train Jimmy
he releases her)
Call you when I get there
She boards and waves to him blows him silly kisses

JIMMY
It’s gonna be okay Dee

She wonders what he means by that as the door closes on them
The train pulls away and he keeps alongside trying to spot her
through a window It picks up speed then is gone

There’s nothing else to do He turns and walks away

INT JIMMY’S HOUSE DAY

CLOSE ON - DOCUMENTS We glimpse the header AETNA LIFE

THE FOYER

Neatly dressed tote bag of cash in hand Jimmy looks over his
home A thousand things left undone -- but he’s out of time He
steps out killing the lights behind him

INT JIMMY’S CAR DUSK
The highway at sundown The white-capped Sandia Mountains area
breathtaking purple and pink as the sun sets on them

EXT DESERTED DEPOT - NIGHT

Ruins of a Santa Fe passenger depot Crumbling brick and wood
structures left to rot

Jimmys car bumps along the dirt road squeaks to a halt It
sits there a moment then the engine goes silent Headlights
remain on

He exits and steps into the lights to show himself Swivels
around -- no signs of life

JIMMY
(calling out)
Vincent (beat) Im alone
Just the faint WIND tugging at withered slats Then--

From the doorway of an old guard’s shack extends an arm
playfully waving a pint of Wild Turkey The hand vanishes inside

Jimmy walks slowly towards it Turns and enters

INT GUARD BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

The headlights partially illuminate the room A rusted steel
desk two crates for chairs

Jimmy steps into the wash A FIGURE in the shadows swigs from
the bottle then emerges - transforming into VINCENT MCCLURE

Wild-eyed and unshaven heavily on the slide ‘Smaller than we
might have expected -- more Buscemi than DeNiro

JIMMY
(calmly faces him)
Hello Vince

VINCENT
(an eye toward the door)
Actually showed up without the

Pm

)

cavalry (smiles) I’m proud of
you Jimbo

Vincent gestures Jimmy takes a seat’

VINCENT
Figured this was a fitting place
to meet up Youremember the time
the old man took us here Pretend-
ed we were gold prospectors

JIMMY
(nodding)
That was a good day

Vincent moves closer surveying his old friend - in stark
contrast to his own filthy matted appearance

VINCENT
Shit you get all dressed up for me
Would’ve cleaned up myself but --
(shrugs) Ritz was all booked
holds the bottle out)
Have a drink Jimmy Not too good
to drink with me are ya

Jimmy accepts the bottle swigs hands it back to Vincent

VINCENT
Feels good - to be back home hang-
ing with a buddy You know I still
consider you my best friend even
after everything Friends like us
that don’t wear out like old tires

Jimmy spies Vincent fiddling with something under his shirt

VINCENT
Used to imagine you and me’d live
next door to each other Wives‘d
be best friends our kids would
Play together Maybe we’d éven
bring ‘em here to pan for gold

And now Vincent removes a gun from his belt -- the same gray
Jimmy found under his mattress He itches his chin with the
barrel places it on the table

VINCENT
Why Jimmy Why’d you have to fuck
all that up

JIMMY
(shakes his head sadly)
Wish I could tellyou

-38

VINCENT
What were we lookin’ at -- a year
apiece in Stillwater Could’ve done
that on our fucking heads Share
the same cell tell jokes in the
mess hall -- dream up crazy schemes
for when we got out We would’ve
been all right

Vincent drinks hard again now rocking on his crate agitated

VINCENT
Suppose though that’s none of
your concern Not your responsi-
bility my fucked up life--

Vincent reaches for the bottle again Jimmy grabs it too -- their
hands touch Vince releases it allows Jimmy to drink He fixes
his eyes on Vincent and after a long silence-

JIMMY
I am responsible (beat) I sold
you out to those Feds I caved
But you always knew that

vincent rubs his head like it’s pounding -- clearly unprepared
for a full confession Jimmy leans closer to him

JIMMY
Six hours they grilled me in that
fucking sweatbox -- I kept askin’
them please to give me a drink of
water After a while Ijust
started yessin’ them tellin’ them
whatever they needed to hear Just
to get out of that goddamn room

Jimmy takes another swig Vince is on his feet now pacing the
gun dangling in his hand

VINCENT
Ever think of tellin’ ‘em the truth
Jimmy No elaborate laundering op-
erationno secret drug routes
just two stupid aringos in over their
heads (beat) You coulda backed
off--after you had your drink of
water--told ‘em you got it all wrong
Shouldered some of the weight with me

Jimmy’s stooped over head in his hands

JIMMY
I wasscared Scared of jail
Vincent tears something out of his pocket -- an age-yellowed
letter He flings it at Jimmy who reluctantly picks it up
Knows what it is

VINCENT

Read it I’ve read it so many
times got it memorized ‘I’m
gonna hire us a lawyer Vincenzo a
good lawyer--prove we were manip-
ulated by those FBI fucks I’m
getting you out of that hell-hole”

(shaking his head)
What about it Jimbo Happened to
the plan No lookin’ back that it

JIMMY
Nobodywould touch the case God
if I could turn back--

VINCENT
A man’s sinkin’ in quicksand you
DON’T KICK HIM IN THE TEETH You
grab his hand try to pull him out

Pom - Vince is at a boil now his fury bubbling up faster than he can

think

Vincent reacts

VINCENT
Like my own fucking mother I show
up there two days ago she runs and
calls my PO-

JIMMY
She‘s dying Vince--she wants you
to go straight--

like he’s been stung clocks Jimmy with the gun
VINCENT

SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH My mother
ain’t--

Jimmy wipes his bleeding mouth Looks back at Vincent who’s

near tears

JIMMY
I’m offering that hand now There’s
some money in the front of my car
Fifty grand To help you start over

Vincent is frozen for a second then approaches menacingly

VINCENT
Always the salesman eh Jimbo
om

Pome

Still trying tonegotiate your
way out of a scrape

(bursts into laughter)
Fifty grand Like tossin’ a band-
aid to a quy bleeding to death

JIMMY
Not a bribe Vincent It’s a gift

Vincent shows Jimmy the needle tracks criss-crossing both arms
the roadmap of his ruined life ‘Then he wings the bottle -- it
explodes against the wall

VINCENT

Too late I’m all bled out

(aims the gun at Jimmy)
It’s been eating at me a long time
how to set things straight Then
you showed up out of nowhere and
everything fell in place Like it
was all arranged

Vincent grits his teeth pained like he’s being torn to pieces
inside He points the gun right in Jimmy’s face -- gripping the
trigger hand violently trembling

Jimmy fights the fear stares back into his friend’s eyes
Prepared to die Then Vincent grabs him in a hug begins shoving
him towards the doorway Gun digging into Jimmy’s chest

VINCENT
Had this real prick of a cell-mate
once-Rhodes was the guy’s name
One time after mess this schmuck
head-butts a guard grabs his 38
--was just like this one here

Vincent starts laughing as he pushes Jimmy outside

EXT DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

VINCENT

And 01’ Rhodesy he’s got the guard
pressed up next to him like us
right now and he’s screamin’ “back
back I’m walkin’ outta here or
this pig gets it” So finally the
guards charge him -- old Rhodes
pulis the trigger and--

(now cracking up)
--bullet goes through both their
skulls ends up in a fuckin’ dinner
tray hundred yards away Asshole
blew his own brains out

yom

Vincent is sweating heavily now shaking all over despite his
cackling He pushes Jimmy to his knees

Vincent walks over to the car opens the Passenger door Returns
with the bag of cash Drops it in the dirty snow next to Jimmy

VINCENT

Well I do thank you for the thought
Jimbo But it ain’t what I had in
mind

(yanks Jimmy to his feet)
Let’s do it partner Two birds
one stone Butch and Sundance -- out
in a blaze of glory

He kisses Jimmy’s forehead hugs him again their heads pressed
tightly side to side Vincent raises the gun to his own temple

VINCENT
We’re gonna be some team in the
next world know that Unstoppable
But no more lying okay Gotta be
straight with me from now on

Jimmy feebly attempts to loose himself but Vincent’s got him
like a vice

JIMMY
Ron’t We can drive away from
here Start over Things can be
just like we--

VINCENT
It’s too late This is better
Won’t feel anything

Vincent is calmer The 38 is no longer quivering

VINCENT
(cocks the gun)
Here we go Jimbo Ready °
(grits his teeth)
Amigos till the end See ya on
the other side hombre

JIMMY
VINCENT-—

A DEAFENING EXPLOSION as the gun fires The SCREEN GOES BLACK

Silence Then a low RINGING We FADE IN to a blood-spattered
Jimmy and Vincent lying in the snow still in an embrace
pene

After a long moment Jimmy’s eyes open -- blinking frantically
He clumsily rises and Vincent slides off him

Jimmy presses his ears the RINGING continues He looks around
dazed in shock Feels his temple where there’s a bleeding
gash then spots--

The 38 slug on the ground twisted and misshapen He turns to--
Vincent blood gullying from twin wounds in his head

Jimmy’s senses return in an instant He slumps over cradies
vVincent’s ruined skull on his lap mumbling and crying

We can’t hear anything just the incessant RINGING

And we begin drifting away from Jimmy gently rocking his dead
friend in the bright glare of the headlights

EXT DESERTED DEPOT LATER

Jimmy glances a last time into the guard’s shack where--

POV - Vincent’s body rests in a pool of scarlet arms crossed at
peace

He trudges trance-like back to his car Money from the tote bag
is scattered in the snow a flurry of bills dancing on the wind
INT JIMMY’S CAR - LATER

Jimmy stares ahead calmly as the highway lines shoot by The
RINGING in his ears slightly less

INT GAS STATION RESTROOM - LATER

Jimmy splashes his face with water Looks at himself in the

mixror His face and shirt still caked with dried blood

INTEXT JIMMY’S CAR - LATER

Jimmy’s car idles at a lonely fork in the highway Continuing
now where the OPENING IMAGE of the film left us

His eyes are focused far far off He smokes Turns on the
radio -- some Bobby Darin Has he defused the bomb Been
granted a reprieve He no longer seems to care

The snow has started falling again Jimmy watches the flakes
drift lazily onto his windshield

ao

He looks at his cigarette--down to the filter A last drag and he
drops it out the window Then he reaches shifts and pulls out
INT JIMMY’S CAR - MINUTES LATER
The snow is falling more heavily now
DJ’S VOICE (0S)

--snowfall continuing overnight

Heres one to keep you warm and re-

member take it easy out there
Another vintage tune begins Jimmys distant eyes are suddenly
drawn to a photo of Deirdre stuck in the dash We CUT TO
EXT AN OPEN FIELD - DAY

Deirdre all smiles yanks at a real-estate sign trying to pull
it out of the grass Across the sign we can read ‘SOLD’

Behind her is a sprawling stretch of land and an old adobe
house clearly in need of some handiwork She’s laughing at the
offscreen Jimmy still tugging at the sign then BACK TO

INT JIMMY’S CAR - NIGHT

Jimmy smiles at the vision as his car comes around a curve
Suddenly the world is lit up by oncoming headlights Bright
swelling

EXT OPEN FIELD - DAY

Back to Dee again as she falls to the grass her hair spilling
everywhere She’s laughing up at us saying something but--

A SOUND drowns out everything The deafening ROAR of an ENGINE
LOCKING TIRES BACK TO
INT JIMMY’S CAR - NIGET

Jimmy as the light swallows him up Staring ahead without fear
or anticipation

The image is washed out by a blinding white GARBLED NOISES
dream-like Then SILENCE A few moments then we--

FADE IN FROM WHITE

eo

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

A crystal New Mexico morning A ribbon of highway wiggles into
oblivion Sheets of snow reflect the sun in an endless sky

Somewhere along the road is a set of skid-marks A broken lane
divider Diamonds of windshield glass

We hear RADIO CRACKLE then a voice bleeding in

VOICE (0S)
Last night heavy snow claimed its
first victim out on I-25 after a
tractor trailer lost control and
skidded through the divider -- in-
stantly killing the driver of an
oncoming vehicle The treacherous
roads have also been blamed for--

The VOICE gradually trails off as Vacaro’s RV appears over a
rise It growls past us out of frame and we--

FADE OUT

‘THE END
