We descend upon Carpathian Ridge a crescent-shaped cliff
that extrudes from the dense Virginia evergreens above a
deep rock canyon

The cliff marks the end of a dirt road that winds down from
above

Donnie Darko (sixteen) is asleep at the edge of the cliff
With his bike collapsed next to him he is shivering curled
up on the foetal position

He slowly opens his eyes and looks around disoriented by
the morning light He then stands up looking down into the
expansive rock canyon After a moment of hesitation he
takes his bike back up the hill

EXT MIDDLESEX - MORNING (11 AM)

Montage is choreographed to Never Tear Us Apart by INXS

Donnie pedals down into the suburban village of Middlesex
Virginia passing by a large rock Middlesex rock-pattern

Donnie pedals past two neighbourhood women who are
speedwalking with handweights They smile at him

A Pontiac Trans-Am speeds by

approaches her dad from behind Eddie turns and aims the
leaf-blower at her face blasting her with air

The Darko family has convened for dinner They eat silently
for several moments

ELIZABETH

EDDIE
Perhaps when you have children of
your own that need braces and you

your husbands paycheck goes to the
federal government youll regret
that decision

ELIZABETH
(amused bitterness)

Will you still be working at Yarn
Barn Cause thats a great place
to raise children

ROSE
No a year of partying is enough
Shell be going to Harvard this fall

ELIZABETH

ROSE

If you think Michael Dukakis will
provide for this country prior to

DONNIE
(to his sister)
Not until like eighth grade

ROSE
(to Donnie)

DONNIE
Whoa Elizabeth A little hostile

pay someone two hundred dollars an
hour to listen to all of your
thoughts so we wont have to

ELIZABETH
Maybe youd like to tell Mom and Dad
why you stopped taking your
medication

An awkward silence

ROSE
(surprised)
Youve stopped taking your medication

SAMANTHA

DONNIE
(glaring at Elizabeth)

lets out a slight guffaw

Heels by Tears for Fears

We pick up teachers Karen Pomeroy (twenty-seven) and Dr
Kenneth Monnitoff (thirty) and Kitty Farmer (forty-two)

practising their routine in the courtyard

We follow Ms Pomeroy into English class then time-lapse
dissolve through the doorway

INT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY (830 AM)

Ms Pomeroy has been reading from The Destructors by Graham
Greene

MS POMEROY
There would be headlines in the
papers Even the grown-up gangs who
ran the betting at the all-in
wrestling and the barrow-boys would
hear with respect how Old Miserys
house had been destroyed It was as
though his plan had been with him
all his life pondered through the
seasons now in his fifteenth year
crystallised with the pain of
puberty

Donnie sits in the front

MS POMEROY (CONTD)
What is Graham Greene trying to
communicate in this passage Why do
the children break into Old Miserys
house

Joanie James raises her hand

MS POMEROY (CONTD)
Joanie

JOANIE
They wanted to rob him

MS POMEROY

Joanie if you had actually read the
short story which at a whopping
thirteen pages must have kept you up
all night you would know that the
children find a great deal of money
hidden in a mattress But they burn
it

The class gives an Awwww Joanie blushes

MS POMEROY (CONTD)
Donnie Darko perhaps given your
recent brush with mass destruction
you can give us your opinion

DONNIE

Well they say it right when they
are ripping the place to shreds
When they flood the house That
like destruction is a form of
creation So the fact that they
burn the money is ironic They
just want to see what happens when
they tear the world apart

(beat)
They want to change things

Gretchen Ross stands at the doorway to the classroom

MS POMEROY
May we help you

GRETCHEN
I just registered and I think they
put me in the wrong English class

Ms Pomeroy studies her

MS POMEROY
You look like you belong here

GRETCHEN
Umm where do I sit

Ms Pomeroy thinks for a moment There are several empty
chairs

MS POMEROY
Sit next to the boy you think is the
cutest Girls get up

The whole class begins to freak out The girls all get out
of their seats eating this up Ronald fixes his hair

MS POMEROY (CONTD)
Quiet Let her choose
Without hesitation Gretchen scans the class for every guy

As she gracefully takes her seat next to Donnie they make
eye contact Donnie grins ear to ear

The class freaks out laughing

it written over and over again

We reveal two Police Officers standing next to Principal

of a television cart Ms Farmer paces in front of them

SHANDA RIESMAN

Laughter from the students

MS FARMER
QUIET

SHANDA RIESMAN
(choking up)
We tried everything But the solution
was there all along

LARRY RIESMAN
(burst out emotionally)
Im not AFRAID anymore

A montage of family imagery follows

NARRATOR
All across America people have
come together to join hands People
who believe that human life is too
important too valuable to be
controlled by FEAR

A middle-aged man walks out onto a country patio It is Jim
Cunningham the guy from the golf course

JIM CUNNINGHAM

DONNIE (CONTD)

She was sent in as Gargemels evil
spy with the intention of destroying
the smurf village But the
overwhelming Goodness of the Smurf
Way of Life transformed her into the
Smurfette we all know and love And
as for the whole gang-bang scenario
it just couldnt happen Smurfs are
asexual They probably dont even
have reproductive organs down there
under those little white pants The
only reason they exist is because of
magic spells and witchcraft which
is all a bunch of bullshit if you
ask me

(beat)
Thats whats so illogical about the
smurfs whats the point of living
if you dont have a dick

Donnie aims the gun pulls the trigger Blam A bottle
breaks

RONALD
Dammit Donnie Why do you always
gotta get all smart on us

Donnie takes the bottle of Night Train and takes a small
sip

She approaches the box again

against an invisible wall as if he were pressing his hand

MS FARMER
I want to know why this FILTH is

being taught to our children

The crowd stirs

PRINCIPAL COLE

MS FARMER
Mr Cole not only am I a TEACHER
but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex
child Therefore I am the ONLY
person here who transcends the parent-
teacher bridge

PRINCIPAL COLE
Kitty

MS FARMER
The bottom line Mr Cole is
that there is material being taught
to our children that is cause for
this destructive behaviour

She stands up

MS FARMER (CONTD)
I have in my hand Graham Greenes
The Destructors This short story
is part of my daughters English
assignment In this story several
children destroy an elderly mans
house from inside out They destroy
his house without motive without
moral consequence They destroy
private property and they get
away with it

Ms Pomeroy shakes her head bitterly

MS FARMER (CONTD)
And how do they do this They FLOOD
the house by breaking through the
water main

PRINCIPAL COLE

investigation

DONNIE
No I just wake up and I look around

GRETCHEN
My dad said never wake a
sleepwalker because they could

drop dead
The Trans-Am crashes head on into a tree Game Over

DONNIE
Its like this big force thats
in your brain But sometimes it grows
bigger and it spread down into
your arms and legs and it just
sends you someplace

GRETCHEN
So when you sleepwalk you go
somewhere familiar

DONNIE
No Every time I wake up somewhere
different Sometimes my bike is
laying there next to me Like once
when I woke up on the edge of this
cliff up on Carpathian Ridge

GRETCHEN

INT HEALTH CLASS - AFTERNOON (THURSDAY 1 PM)

Ms Farmer stands next to the television where Jim Cunningham
narrates the Lifeline tutorial

JIM CUNNINGHAM
And so let us begin Lifeline Exercise
No 1

PLEASE PRESS STOP NOW appears on the screen

Ms Farmer stops the tape and moves to the blackboard On
it she has drawn a horizontal line book-ended by the words
Love and Fear

MS FARMER
As you can see the Lifeline is
controlled by two polar extremes
Fear and Love Fear is in the
negative energy spectrum Love is
in the positive energy spectrum

SEAN
(to Donnie)
No duh
MS FARMER

Excuse me
(defensive)
No duh is a product of fear

She stares them down for a moment shaking her head

MS FARMER (CONTD)
(handing out cards)
Now on each card is a CHARACTER
DILEMMA which applies to the Lifeline
Please read each character dilemma
aloud and place an X on the
Lifeline in the appropriate place

The students read their cards

KITTY FARMER
Well start in the front

Cherita Chen stands up and walks over to the blackboard

white animated cartoons on them

respective human dilemmas

Finally it is his turn

DONNIE
Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground
filled with money She takes the
wallet to the address on the drivers
license but keeps the money inside
the wallet

Donnie looks at the blackboard

DONNIE (CONTD)
Im sorry Ms Farmer I just dont
get this

MS FARMER
(impatient)
Just place an X in the appropriate
place on the Lifeline

DONNIE
I just dont get this Everything
cant be lumped into two categories
Thats too simple

MS FARMER
The Lifeline is divided that way

DONNIE
Well life isnt that simple So
what if Ling Ling kept the cash and
returned the wallet That has nothing
to do with either fear or love

MS FARMER
(impatient)
Fear and love are the deepest of
human emotions

DONNIE
Well yeah OK but youre not
listening to me

(MORE )

DONNIE (CONTD)
There are other things that need to
be taken into account here Like the
whole spectrum of human emotion
Youre just lumping everything into
these two categories and like
denying everything else

Ms Farmer stares at Donnie vehemently She cant believe
what shes hearing

DONNIE (CONTD)
People arent that simple

MS FARMER
(not knowing how to
argue with him)
If you dont complete the assignment
youll get a zero for the day

Donnie thinks for a moment and then raises his hand
INT PRINCIPAL COLES OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 PM)

dont know what has gotten into him

MS FARMER

Rose Ill tell you this because our
daughters have been on dance team
together for two years and I respect
you as WOMAN But after witnessing
your sons behaviour today I have

Dr Monnitoff

DR MONNITOFF

Donnie

DONNIE
I know that this is gonna sound kinda
weird but do you know anything

about time travel

Dr Monnitoff pauses turns and looks at Donnie He seems to
know something

INT PHYSICS CLASS - LATER ON

Dr Monnitoff has drawn a diagram on the blackboard In his
hand he holds a copy of Stephen Hawkings A Brief History
of Time

DR MONNITOFF
So according to Hawking
wormholes might be able to provide a
shot cut for jumping between two
distant regions of space-time

DONNIE
So in order to travel back in
time youd have to have a big
spaceship or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light --

DR MONNITOFF
Theoretically

DONNIE
-- and be able to find one of these
wormholes

DR MONNITOFF
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen
bridge which is theoretically a
wormhole in space controlled by man

DONNIE
So thats it

DR MONNITOFF
The basic principles of time travel
are there
(beat)
So you have the vessel and the portal
And the vessel can be anything
Most likely a spacecraft

EXT SCHOOL COURTYARD - NEXT
Cherita Chen listens to this conversation intently
INT PHYSICS CLASS - NEXT

this

(beat)

The woman who wrote it used to
teach here a long time ago She was

and started teaching science

Donnie takes the battered book we see the cover

INT SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

EDDIE
Grandma Death

DONNIE
(to Eddie)
You know Roberta Sparrow We almost
hit her with the car the other day

ROSE

The family is taken aback

EDDIE
Youre right Roberta Sparrow was
famous for her gem collections Kids
used to try and steal stuff from her

all the time Over the years as
she got older she became more and
more of a recluse now she just

likes to stay up there all by herself
DONNIE
I guess she just lost faith in the
world
EXT DARKO BACKYARD - SUNSET (SATURDAY 530 PM)

DR THURMAN

DONNIE
I dont think so Its like a TV
station And theyre tuned into
mine and no one elses

DR THURMAN
Who is they Is Frank part of some
larger group

DONNIE
I dont know Gretchen has a theory
That Frank is a sign I told her I
thought it was ridiculous

DR THURMAN
A sign from whom

DONNIE

(changing the subject)
I think that Frank wants me to go to
this woman

(holding up the book)
She wrote a book about time travel
Frank asked me if I believed in time
travel That cant just be a random
coincidence

(beat)
My dad almost hit her with the car
the other day and she said the
creepiest thing She said that every
living creature on this earth dies
alone

DR THURMAN
How does that make you feel

DONNIE
It reminded me of my dog Callie

DR THURMAN
Is Callie still around

DONNIE
No She died when I was eight We
couldnt find her for days She
went and crawled underneath our back
porch

DR THURMAN
Do you feel alone right now

He looks at her for a moment

DONNIE
Id like to believe that Im not
but Ive just never seen any proof
So I just choose not to bother with
it Its like I could spend my
whole life thinking about it
debating it in my head Weighing
the pros and cons And in the end
I still wouldnt have any proof So
--I dont even debate it any more
Because its absurd

(beat)
I dont want to be alone
(beat)
So does that make me like an
atheist

DR THURMAN
No That makes you keep searching

Donnie takes this in for a moment

room wearing a Dorothy outfit from The Wizard of Oz

INT FAMILY ROOM - NEXT

Donnie sits back in the La-Z Boy dozing off

at

John Maddens CBS chalkboard unfolds on the TV screen Madden
traces his electronic lines across the screen tracing the

movement of the players as their images are frozen in
time
Donnies eyes close and then re-open

Donnie turns his head and sees that the room is momentarily
bathed in artificial white light as if God hit the slow-
motion button during a flash of lightning

Donnie turns his head and sees that protruding from his
fathers stomach is a thick spear made of silvery plastic
gel

As Eddie gets up from the couch to walk over to the
refrigerator his spear precedes him morphing into an
extruded arrow that reaches the refrigerator several seconds
before him

The spear traces the exact geography of his movement through
time using his centre of gravity as its axis point

Donnie turns and sees Samantha skipping from the kitchen
as her spear bounces several feet in front of her like a
caterpillar

Her spear smaller than her fathers is proportional to
her mass

SAMANTHA
(her voice echoing
through the silence)
Follow the yellow brick road

Donnie looks down at his stomach and sees his own spear
protruding outward It then begins to extrude forward towards
the foyer

He does not follow it It then retreats back in and beckons
him to follow

Like a child transfixed by a firefly Donnie follows the
path of his spear into the foyer

INT FOYER UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NXT

Donnie and his spear round the corner and arrive in his
parents bedroom

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
His spear leads him to the closet He opens the closet door

and the spear leads him down to a box hidden beneath his
fathers shoe rack

Donnie removes the box from the closet and unlatches it
Inside is a gun Donnie removes the pistol from the box
staring at it with the same childlike expression

Suddenly Donnies universe snaps back to normal The white
light strobes the spear has vanished

Donnie still holds the gun His expression changes to nervous
shock

His eyes linger over the gun for a moment he then quickly
puts it back in the box and carefully places the box back
under the shoe rack

EXT GOLF COURSE FOREST - THAT AFTERNOON (3 PM)

every night could be the last forever
Like perpetual darkness

DONNIE
Why not just buy your baby a night
light

GRETCHEN

Thats not good enough Youve got

DR THURMAN
Rose let me just lay out what I
believe is happening here Donnies
aggressive behaviour seems to stem
from his increased detachment from
reality His inability to cope with
the forces in the world that he
perceives to be threatening

Rose smiles nervously

DR THURMAN (CONTD)
Has your son ever told you about
Frank

ROSE
Come again

DR THURMAN
Frank the giant bunny rabbit

ROSE
Frank

DR THURMAN
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight
hallucination

ROSE
Youre telling me my son has an
imaginary friend

DR THURMAN
He has described lengthy
conversations physical encounters
with what I believe to be a
manifestation of his subconscious
mind

Rose looks over at Eddie with an expression of panic

ROSE
I What can we do

DR THURMAN
I would like to put him through more

hypnotherapy and increase his
medication
Eddie looks at Rose who nods in approval
ROSE

If thats what you think is necessary
DR THURMAN

But let me remind you that this

treatment is experimental

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Donnie walks into the kitchen and removes a butchers knife
from a drawer

INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Donnie stands in front of the bathroom mirror catatonic
looking at his reflection

Frank stands behind him

Suddenly Donnie turns around with the butchers knife and
lunges at Frank with all of his weight

The knife collides with Franks invisible force field as if
it were liquid steel Donnie lunges repeatedly at Frank with
psychotic rage but the knife bounces off

Good morning

JIM CUNNINGHAM
Thats all the gusta you can musta
I said Good morning

AUDIENCE
(yelling louder)
Good MORNING

JIM CUNNINGHAM

are AFRAID just to say GOOD
MORNING

AUDIENCE

(screaming)
GOOD MORNING

JIM CUNNINGHAM
Are you AFRAID

AUDIENCE
(screaming louder)
GOOD MORNING

JIM CUNNINGHAM

Now thats what I like to hear

(suddenly serious)
Because too many young men and women
today are paralysed by their fears
They give in to their feelings of
self-doubt they surrender their
bodies to the temptations of drugs
alcohol and premarital sex Empty
solutions These are toxic chemicals
and disease-spreading behaviour

A large screen lowers behind him

JIM CUNNINGHAM (CONTD)

I would like to tell you a story
today about a young man whose life
was destroyed by the instruments of
fear A young man searching for
love in all the wrong places

(shaking his head

tragically)
His name was Frank

On the giant screen an image slide appears of a young cartoon
teenager whose eyes are whacked out on drugs The title
appears HIS NAME WAS FRANK

Upon hearing the name Frank Donnie falls into a paranoid
trance

Gretchen who looks extremely bored leans over to Donnie

GRETCHEN
Lets get out of here

Donnie ignores her His eyes are locked on Jim Cunningham
who begins his rousing re-enactment of the sad unfortunate
downfall of Frank

Within minutes Jim Cunningham has the crowd laughing
enamoured of him with his cartoon slide show

The huge screen rises upwards and Jim Cunningham takes
questions from the crowd from portable mike stands in the
back of the auditorium

Several students get up and go to the mikes

DORKY GIRL
Hi Um my stepsister like I
sometimes worry that she eats too

much

OVERWEIGHT GIRL
(mortified yelling
at her sister from
the crowd)
Shut up Kim

DORKY GIRL
Im just trying to help you

JIM CUNNINGHAM
Theres no need to be embarrassed
Many times we eat because we are
afraid to face the reality of our
ego reflections We shouldnt just
look INTO the mirror We should look
THROUGH the mirror

DORKY GIRL
Thanks

Kitty Farmer runs out onto the stage and hands Jim Cunningham
a bottle of water and a towel She gives him the thumbs-up
sign and runs back offstage

LANKY KID
Um How can I decide what I want
to be when I grow up

JIM CUNNINGHAM
I think you should look deep within
yourself deep within your heart
and find what it is in the world
that makes you feel LOVE Just pure
LOVE And then go to that In your
studies in your athletics go
towards love

LANKY KID
Thank you

Donnie gets up from his seat and goes to the mike

LARRY RIESMAN
What can I do to learn how to fight

JIM CUNNINGHAM
Violence is a product of fear Those
who love themselves enough should
have no need to fight another person
Learn to truly love yourself and
the world will be yours

LARRY RIESMAN
Okay

Donnie steps up to the mike stand

DONNIE
(furious )
How much are they paying you to be
here

DONNIE (CONTD)

(to Dorky Girl)
If you want your sister to lose
weight tell her to get off the

want to be when you grow up Most of
the time nobody does How about

(to Larry)

your head in a toilet Then go lift
some weights take a karate lesson

And when he tries to do it again

More rumblings from the faculty Laughter from the students
gets louder

JIM CUNNINGHAM

troubled confused young man I
think youre searching for answers
in all the wrong places

these glasses for your infant and
they wear them at night when they
sleep

GRETCHEN
And inside these glasses are these
slide photographs And each photograph
is of something peaceful or
beautiful Whatever pictures the
parent wants to put inside

DR MONNITOFF
What effect do you think this would
have on an infant

DONNIE
Well the thing is nobody remembers
their infancy And anyone who says
they do is lying We think that this
would help develop memory earlier in
life

DR MONNITOFF
Did you stop and think that maybe
infants need darkness That darkness
is part of their natural development

Seth Davis raises his hand
SETH
What if the parents like put in
photographs of Satan pentagrams

As firefighters continue their

INT PHYSICS CLASS - DAY (2 PM)

Donnie and Dr Monnitoff are having another in-depth
conversation

DR MONNITOFF
Each vessel travels along a vector
path through space-time along its
centre of gravity

DONNIE
(to himself)
Like a spear

DR MONNITOFF
Beg pardon

DONNIE
Like a spear that comes out of your
stomach

DR MONNITOFF
Uhh sure And in order for the
vessel to travel through time it
must find the portal in this case
the wormhole or some unforeseen
portal that lies undiscovered

DONNIE
Could these wormholes appear in
nature

DR MONNITOFF
That is highly unlikely Youre
talking about an act of God

DONNIE
If God controls time then all
time is pre-decided Then every living
thing travels along a set path

DR MONNITOFF
Im not following you

DONNIE
If you could see your path or channel
growing out of your stomach you
could see into the future And thats
a form of time travel right

DR MONNITOFF
You are contradicting yourself
Donnie If we could see our destines
manifest themselves visually then
we would be given the choice to betray
our chosen destinies The very fact
that this choice exists would
mean that all pre-formed destiny
would end

DONNIE
Not if you chose to stay within Gods
channel

DR MONNITOFF
(cutting him off)
Donnie Im afraid I cant continue
this conversation I could lose my
job

With all due respect sir what
specifically about my methods do you
find inappropriate

Principal Cole stares at her for a moment

PRINCIPAL COLE
I dont have to get myself into a
debate about this Karen I believe
I have made myself clear

MS POMEROY
You call this clarity I dont
think you have a clue what its really
like to communicate with these kids
You dont think that they can smell
your bullshit from a mile away Every
day that goes by that we fail
to inspire them is another
moment that we all lose And we are
losing them to apathy and this
prescribed nonsense They are slipping
away

PRINCIPAL COLE
I am sorry that you have failed Now

Fivers vision do they believe him

It could be the death of an entire
way of life the end of an era

DONNIE
Why should we care

MS POMEROY
Because the rabbits are us Donnie

DONNIE
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like
it was a human

MS POMEROY
Is the death of one species less
tragic than another

DONNIE
Of course A rabbit is not like us
It has no history books it has no

knowledge of sorrow or regret I

like bunnies and all Theyre cute
and theyre horny And if youre

cute and horny then youre probably
happy that you dont know who you
are or why youre even alive But
the only thing Ive known rabbits to
do is have sex as many times as
possible before they die
He looks over at Gretchen who looks angry at this

DONNIE (CONTD)
Theres no point in crying for a

dead rabbit who never feared death

to begin with
The class is silent for a moment

Youre wrong

Youre wrong about these rabbits
These rabbits can talk They are the
product of the authors imagination
And he cares for them So we care
for them too We care that their
home has been destroyed and that
their lives are in danger Otherwise

weve missed the point

MS POMEROY

But arent we forgetting the miracle
of storytelling The dea ex machina

The god machine That is how the
rabbits are saved

Gretchen looks across the room at Donnie with a disdainful

expression

They fired me

DONNIE
Thats bullshit Youre a good
teacher

MS POMEROY
Thank you Donnie And youre a good
student Lazy but a good student
Unlike most of the others you
question Mom and Dads rules

DONNIE
What do I tell the rest of the class
when they ask about you

MS POMEROY

(long beat)
Tell them that everything is going
to be just fine

(beat)
It is up to the children to save
themselves these days Because the
parents they dont have a clue

Donnie looks at the blackboard On it she has written in
perfect penmanship Cellar Door

DONNIE
Whats Cellar Door

MS POMEROY

(spaced out)
A famous linguist once said that
of all the phrases in the English
language of all the endless
combinations of words in all of
history that Cellar Door is the
most beautiful

She is silent for a moment

DONNIE
Cellar door

MS POMEROY
Sometimes its the only thing that
keeps us going

She takes the box and crosses the room towards Donnie

MS POMEROY (CONTD)

So will Donnie find his Cellar
Door
DONNIE
I think I already have
(beat)

But now she wont even talk to me

MS POMEROY
Then go find her Donnie Dont let
her get away
(stopping at the door)
She was right about the rabbits Go

INT MAIN HALLWAY - NEXT (315 PM)
And with that Ms Pomeroy turns and walks down the hallway

with her career in a cardboard box heading towards the
bright Friday afternoon sunlight

Donnie walks back down the hallway lost in his own
introspection
Across the way at her locker as Cherita Chen Donnie

approaches her slowly like a cat
She turns from her locker and they make eye contact

She looks at him warily frightened A book falls from her
arms onto the floor

Written in large letters on the brown book cover is his name
DONNIE DARKO
He comes face to face with her grabs her earmuffs with both
hands and touches his forehead to hers as if he were going
to kiss her
DONNIE
(long beat)
I promise that one day things will
get better for you

Cherita holds still for a moment trembling and then jerks
back from him Her earmuffs come off in his hands

She backs away from him slowly A single tear rolls down her
cheek

CHERITA
Chut up

She then turns and runs down the hall disappearing from
sight

EXT OLD GUN ROAD - AFTERNOON (4 PM)

Donnie walks by himself thinking wearing Cheritas
earmuffs

DR THURMAN
And when I clap my hands together

DONNIE
Yes

DR THURMAN
So your parents why did you
disappoint them

DONNIE
I I was playing with fire

DR THURMAN

the world to set the world on fire

DR THURMAN
But it was an accident The house
was under construction

DONNIE
People get hurt I dont want to
hurt anyone

DR THURMAN
But you were punished

DONNIE
Yes I went to jail

by your parents instead

DONNIE
They didnt buy me what I wanted
for Christmas that year

DR THURMAN
What did you want for Christmas that
year

DONNIE
Hungry Hungry Hippos
DR THURMAN
How did you feel being denied
those Hungry Hungry Hippos

DONNIE
Regret

DR THURMAN
What else makes you feel regret

DONNIE
That I did it again

DR THURMAN
(alarmed )
Youve done it again

DONNIE
Yes I flooded my school and I
burned down that perverts house I
think I only have a few days left
before they catch me

DR THURMAN
Why did you do these things Donnie
Did Frank tell you to commit these
crimes

He does not respond

DONNIE
I have to obey him because he
saved my life He controls me and I
have to obey him or Ill be left all
alone and Ill never figure out
what all of this means

DR THURMAN
If God exists

DONNIE
I think now that he might

DR THURMAN
Why

DONNIE
Because Im so horny

DR THURMAN
God exists because youre horny

DONNIE
I think so I think thats one of
the clues Its a clue that tells
us to keep going

DR THURMAN
Where are we going

No answer

DR THURMAN (CONTD)
Where are we going Donald

DONNIE
I have the power to build a time
machine

DR THURMAN
How is that possible

DONNIE
Grandma Death will teach me how
Soon

DR THURMAN
Then how is time travel possible

DONNIE
It would have to be Gods portal
They will lead me to it Then I will
go back in time and I wont feel
regret anymore

DR THURMAN
When will this happen

DONNIE
Soon Time is almost up

Donnie gets up on his feet staggering around the room He
looks frightened childlike

DONNIE (CONTD)
It has to happen soon it has to
happen soon

Dr Thurman gets up and tries to control Donnie following
him around the room

DR THURMAN
What is going to happen

DONNIE
(freaking out)
Frank is going to kill

DR THURMAN
Who is he going to kill

Dr Thurman grabs him trying to get him under control in an
awkward embrace

DR THURMAN (CONTD)
Who is he going to kill

Donnie stares across the office like a frightened child
as the room becomes white with artificial light

Frank is there in the office staring back at him

DONNIE
(freaking out)
I can see him right now

DR THURMAN
Where is he Donald

DONNIE
Hes right there He can read my
mind and hell show me the way out
of this The sky is going to open
up and then He will reveal himself
to me

DR THURMAN
If the sky were to suddenly open

up there would be no law there
would be no rule There would only
be you and your memories the

choices youve made and the people
youve touched The life that has

been carved out from your subconscious
is the only evidence by which you

will be judged by which you must
judge yourself Because when this
world ends there will only be you

and him and no one else

DONNIE
Its too late Ive already ruined
my life

DR THURMAN
You will survive this Donald I
promise you that you will survive
You must let me help you
(beat)
And when I clap my hands together
you will wake up

She claps her hands together twice and Donnie snaps out
of his trance

INT THERAPISTS OFFICE - AFTERNOON (2 PM)

Donnie calmed down and putting his jacket on walks slowly
to the doorway

Dr Thurman stands looking out the window

DR THURMAN
Donald

Donnie turns back and faces her Beat

DR THURMAN (CONTD)
Your medication Theyre placebos
Just pills made out of water

DONNIE
Thank you

DR THURMAN
Donald an atheist is someone who
denies altogether the existence of a
God You are an agnostic An agnostic
is someone who believes that there
can be no proof of the existence of
God but does not deny the
possibility that God exists

We move towards the grandfather clock and see the minute
hand reach midnight

INT FOYER - NIGHT (1230 AM)

Donnie and Gretchen walk downstairs They kiss and she goes
towards the family room

Donnie walks towards the kitchen but then doubles over
against the wall in pain

Suddenly the room blows out with a strobe of white light
as costumed teenagers and their vector spears intersect in a
shimmering maze of chaos

Donnie slowly follows his spear as it leads him through the
crowd directly towards the refrigerator

Donnie stares blankly at what he sees scrawled in magic
marker on the memo board

It reads FRANK WAS HERE WENT TO GET BEER
Donnie stares at the board for several moment he then
turns his head and sees a teenager with a Ronald Reagan mask

walk by

He then sees another spear come towards him Gretchen rounds
the corner coming in from the family room

Donnie falls to his knees and puts his face inside the end
of Gretchens spear We see his POV - an abyssal tunnel
of light

DONNIE
Come with me

GRETCHEN
Where are we going

He grabs her and pulls her out the back of the kitchen into
the back yard Ronald and Sean follow

EXT BACKYARD PATIO - NEXT

They ride their bikes through the forest
EXT GRANDMA DEATHS HOUSE - NIGHT (130 AM)

They stand in front of the dark house It is pitch-black No
lights anywhere

SEAN
Theres nobody here Just forget
it
Then there is a clanking noise from somewhere around the

side of the house Everyone hears it

Donnie looks towards the lower front of the house where there
is a cellar door

GRETCHEN
Is that a cellar door
DONNIE
(his eyes widen)
Yeah
The cellar door is ajar and there is a dim light coming
out from inside
RONALD
Dont open it Donnie Lets just

leave
INT GRANDMA DEATHS CELLAR - NEXT

Donnie and Gretchen open the door to the cellar and descend
down into a murky pit with a stone floor

Inside the room is quite large filled with row after
row of boxes paintings antique furniture and chandeliers
There is even an ancient piano in the back

Gretchen slowly reaches her hand out and places her finger
on the deepest piano key

Suddenly a figure emerges from the shadows and slams Donnie
into the wall He then grabs Gretchen by placing an arm
around her neck with a butchers knife

It is Ricky Danforth Seth comes out from another corner
also brandishing a butchers knife Both have pantyhose pulled
over their heads

RICKY
Get the fuck out Now

Ricky drags Gretchen out Seth drags Donnie out
EXT GRANDMA DEATHS HOUSE - NEXT
The four of them come bursting out of the cellar

Seth holds Donnies arms down with his knees and places the
butchers knife against his throat

Ricky throws Gretchen down hard onto the shoulder of Old Gun
Road She lets out a gasp of pain as her head hits the
gravel

RICKY
Motherfuckers
SETH
I have a bigger knife now
Sean and Ronald watch dumbfounded backing away
Seth just stares down at Donnie with his dead eyes pushing

the knife down harder cutting off Donnies air supply

SEAN
Hey theres someone coming Look
theres a car coming

Seth slowly turns his head and sees far down Old Gun
Road approaching headlights
DONNIE

(barely audible whisper)
Dea ex machina

SETH
What did you say

DONNIE
Our saviour

The headlights are getting close

RICKY
They called the fuckin cops

Gretchen struggles to breathe on the shoulder of the road
the wind knocked out of her semi-conscious

SETH
Thats no cop

The headlights are getting close

GRETCHEN
(in a hoarse whisper)
Donnie
Even closer
DONNIE
You better run
RICKY
Forget it lets go
Seth doesnt move He just stares down at Donnie

RICKY (CONTD)
Come on Lets go

SETH
Youre dead Donnie Darko

Seth gets up and runs off with Ricky into the forest just
as the approaching car crests the top of Old Gun Road at
breakneck speed

Suddenly in the bright glow of the cars headlights is
the silhouette of Grandma Death standing in the middle of
the road In her right hand she is clutching a letter

Donnies letter

GRETCHEN
Donnie

The car swerves left barely missing Grandma Death

The Pontiac tries to brake hard but the wheels lock
and it goes skidding onto the shoulder

Gretchen raises her head from the gravel into bright
headlight beams

The Trans-Am goes barrelling over her like a speed-bump
and her limp body rolls off into the grassy ditch

The Trans-Am skids off into the grass and collides head-on
with the crumbling stone chimney which explodes into the
crumpled hood of the car as it eventually comes to a stop
in a fury of smoke

Donnie staggers to his feet regaining his breath He runs
over to Gretchen and kneels down next to her

DONNIE
Gretchen wake up Wake up

Her neck is broken She has no pulse

The passenger door to the Trans-Am opens and a passenger in
a clown costume gets out

The drivers side door opens and the driver gets out
He is wearing a rabbit suit A Halloween costume
He is holding the grotesque rabbit helmet in his hand

It is Frank

PASSENGER
Frank whatd you do whatd you
do
Frank approaches Donnie who raises his head from Gretchen
to see him for the first time face to face with an

expression of shocked horror

PASSENGER (CONTD)
Shes dead You killed her Frank

Frank is in shock

FRANK
Shes dead

Donnie slowly nods his head Sean and Ronald approach him
slowly Grandma Death looms behind them

FRANK (CONTD)
What the fuck Look at my fucking
car

PASSENGER
Lets get out of here Lets get out
of here Frank

FRANK
What were you stupid fucks doing in
the middle of the road

DONNIE
Waiting for you

Donnie raises the gun from his fathers closet with his right
hand and to his own surprise he pulls the trigger

Franks left eye implodes as the bullet passes through his
head His body falls limply to the ground

PASSENGER
Holy shit

The Passenger turns and runs off into the woods

RONALD
Whatd you do Donnie Whatd you
do

DONNIE

(very calm)
Go home Go home and tell your parents
that everything is going to be just
fine

After contemplation of the recent events Sean and Ronald
turn and run off in the opposite direction

Donnie is left alone with the dead bodies
He turns and stares at Grandma Death who is calmly standing
there with his letter in her hand

GRANDMA DEATH
A storm is coming
