KIDD

Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen
My name is Captain Jefferson Kyle
Kidd and I’m here tonight to bring
yall the news from across this
great world of ours

(beat)
Now I know how life is in these
parts - working your trade sun up
to sun down No time for reading
newspapers right

A ripple of amusement Most of these folks are illiterate

KIDD (CONTD)

So let me do that work for you And
maybe just for tonight we can
escape our troubles and hear of the
great changes a’happening out
there

(adjusts his newspapers)
Now for any virgin listeners
here’s how it’s gonna go We’1l
start with a little local news
That which affects you and yours
truly most direct From there we’1l
go on and take in the federal
picture

GROANS from audience

KIDD (CONTD)
Oh I hear ya you know I do they
got us down and now they’re keeping
us down But lend me your ears
even still Cos after we’ve heard
what those wise wise gentlemen up
in Washington have in store for us
next
(laughter)
Well then we get to take wings and
escape
(holding up The Bombay
Gazette)
Well head to the crimson mountains
of India in pursuit of a marauding
beast that’s claimed the lives of
thirty-one farming souls And it’s
still a-hunting

(holds up another paper)
(MORE )

KIDD (CONTD)

Then we’ll sweep west into deepest
Africa by way of the pages of
Harpers Illustrated and pick up
the trail of a legendary British
explorer battling through the
jungle for the source of the mighty
River Nile

(holds up a clutch of

handwritten wire reports)
And running hot from the national
wire service is a breaking story
of a miraculous return to life
that quite frankly I’m gonna have
a very hard time convincing y’all
is true

(pauses )
--But how’s about y’all let me
try

(beat)
Cos when the sun finally goes down
at the end of our day and darkness
follows y’all will have with you
stories of men women and families
who - though thousands of miles
away facing trials of their own -
are in fact very much like you All
working living an’ loving in
whatever way they can And all of
them waiting Waiting for better
days to come

And we see his audience hooked

Kidd reaches the climax of his reading

KIDD

From inside the jaws of that
tiger the young Alajar fought for
his life Man versus beast A
battle waged since the dawn of time
itself

(reading)
“And in those final moments when
all hope seemed lost Alajar gained
the upper hand With his free arm
he reached towards his fallen
blade The jaws of the monster
began to close But Alajar wrapped
his fingers around the hilt and as
they fell to the ground plunged it
deep into the animal’s neck

(beat)
Alajar rolled free And at last
the mighty tiger fell silent”

Kidd sets the newspaper down

The audience bursts into APPLAUSE

Kidd enters a shallow valley The track narrower
Flanked by trees and dense thicket

No sign of the horses
Kidd dismounts
The wagon is empty
And a cluster of hoof marks in the dust And blood
The signs of someone having been dragged away
Kidd takes out a BATTERED OLD SHOTGUN from behind his saddle
He follows the trail
And finds an African-America Man strung up in a tree
Pinned to his chest a newspaper

And now we’re cat-and-mouse amongst the rocks Mano e mano
under a Texan sun

Until
Kidd behind a rock Johanna beside him
Hands him another loaded shell
He inches around Looking for Almay
Everything suddenly quiet
Just the body of Jones lying out in the open
The other down the slope
On Kidd Did Almay run
Suddenly
Almay appears on Kidd’s blind side
He fires
But Kidd goes low and fires too
Hits Almay square in the chest
And it’s over
A moment
Kidd surveys the battle field blood running from his wound
The bodies lying there
He retrieves his revolver
Only one bullet left
KIDD
(to Johanna)
We need to go

CUT TO

EXT RAVINE ROAD - DAY 89
Kidd pulls them up another hill

Wagon shot to pieces The wheel clanking

The reach a secluded spot

CUT TO

EXT CAMP - NIGHT 90
Kidd patching his wound watching the plain below

Johanna tending the horses

She spits into the red earth

Puts her finger in the paste

Starts painting shapes on the horse’s flank as she sings
Kidd knows what this is The story of the battle

She looks back at him

Trying to read his expression

KIDD
You’re right We won

CUT TO

EXT CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT 91
Johanna asleep
Kidd throws his coat over her

Sit hunched against his saddle the campfire throwing shadows
across his beaten-up face

The longer the road the harder it is

CUT TO

EXT TEXAS PRAIRIE - DAWN 92
Sun up over the immense Texas prairie

CUT TO

EXT WAGON ON THE ROAD SOUTH - MORNING 93
They ride on

In the distance Buffalo But noticeably thinner than before
Joanna watching him

She tentatively touches her face Pointing with her lips and
little finger

Kidd realises Touches the wound on his face

KIDD
I’ve had worse

Kidd stretches back Easing the tension in his shoulder
KIDD (CONTD)
We’re OK Just keep to the road
We’ll get there
Johanna leans down
Picks up a dime piece from the floor of the wagon
Turns it in her hand Makes it reflect in the sun
KIDD (CONTD)

(seeing this)
That’s a dime

JOHANNA
Dime-ah
KIDD
That’s right It’s money
JOHANNA
Boom
KIDD

Yeah I guess it can be both

She takes a strip of leather from her buckskins Fashions the
dime into a necklace

Puts it on
KIDD (CONTD)
(sees it)

Pretty

He looks at her She smiles

93

Suddenly the wagon lurches Kidd almost comes out of his
seat

Johanna stifles a laugh
Kidd notices
A beat and then

He lurches the cart the other way Deliberately Pretends to
unseat

And now she belly laughs

Kidd lurches again Nearly falling off for real this time
And now he’s belly laughing too

Both surprised at the other

CUT TO

EXT WAGON ON THE ROAD SOUTH - LATER THAT DAY 94
They ride on

Johanna quietly singing a lullaby

A loaded FREIGHT WAGON rolls past in the opposite direction
Kidd listening

She looks up Birds dancing high above them

KIDD
Bird We call that a bird
JOHANNA
Bod
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Bird

She looks at him
Repeats Expecting him to copy her
JOHANNA (CONTD)
(in Kiowa subtitled)

Bird

See Kidd This is something new

94 94

KIDD
(repeating her Kiowa)
Bird

She mocks his pronunciation
Kidd tries again

Now she’s laughing

She points to a tree

JOHANNA
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Tree

KIDD
(in Kiowa)
Tree
(knows he’s being mocked)
Alright cos you’re so smart

He looks out Sees a cactus

KIDD (CONTD)
Prickly pear

Johanna tries But it’s too hard to say

KIDD (CONTD)

Exactly

(beat)
Then we got Juniper out there
Mesquite It’s got those little
thorns

(points at Sage bushes)
And we got Sage

JOHANNA
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Sage

She opens her talisman
Breathes in
KIDD
Smells good don’t it Especially

(in Kiowa subtitled)
Sage

94 94

JOHANNA
(in English)

A moment of understand between them They can communicate

KIDD

She points out at the prairie with her lips

JOHANNA

JOHANNA

Then she points up at the sky

JOHANNA
(in Kiowa subtitled)

Kidd watching

KIDD

He watches as Johanna wraps her arms around herself
JOHANNA

She motions again And exhales gently

JOHANNA

Then she makes a sign A circle
KIDD (CONTD)
A circle All joined
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Daw

(Looks at her)
I understand

He draws a line with his finger
KIDD (CONTD)
Where I come from it’s more of a
line

She watches him draw it

KIDD (CONTD)
A line

JOHANNA
Li-an 94

KIDD

Yeah that’s right A line

(beat)
Were all journeying out across the
plains in a line Looking for a
place to be And when we find it
we go straight out and plough All
in a line Working working Never
stopping Never looking back

Kidd makes the sign of the line again
KIDD (CONTD)
And that’s how we live Until once
in a while when the sun gets low
and the soft wind blows we wonder
how the hell we got here
He trails off

She makes the sign of a line

KIDD (CONTD)
That’s right a line Very good

JOHANNA
Velly goot

Kidd laughs

KIDD
Velly goot indeed

JOHANNA
(laughing)
Velly good Onkle

See Kidd He turns to face her

KIDD
Onkle Did you say Onkle

JOHANNA
Onkle

Kidd pulls the wagon to a stop

KIDD
Onkle That’s German

She looks over at him as surprised as he is
KIDD (CONTD)

Can you remember anything else 94

A moment as she thinks
And then

JOHANNA
Ist du meine Onkle

KIDD
No I’m not your uncle

She frowns Struggling with a new memory

KIDD (CONTD)
What What is it

She looks at him As though for help
Then slowly a look of horror crosses her face

As if fearful memories lie deep inside And are pushing up to
the surface

Kidd sees her struggling Confusion And rising terror

KIDD (CONTD)
(knows what this is)
Hey leave it Forget it I
shouldn’t have asked

And he rides on

KIDD (CONTD)
Let’s do animals

He looks out Spots a jack-rabbit

KIDD (CONTD)
See Jack-rabbit What’s rabbit

JOHANNA
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Rabbit

KIDD
(in Kiowa)
Rabbit
(in English)
Oh that’s a tricky one Say it
again

But Johanna has noticed something ahead 94

JOHANNA
(in Kiowa subtitled)
Buffalo
A mutilated buffalo carcass By the side of the track
A bit further on
More skinned carcasses lying out under the hot sun
The sound of insects
A baby buffalo standing helpless beside its dead mother
JOHANNA (CONTD)
(in Kiowa angry)
How pitiable Terrible

Kidd looks ahead Forest

CUT TO

EXT ON THE ROAD SOUTH - DAY 95

EXT DURAND TOWN - NIGHT

Kidd and Johanna led towards town

CUT TO

Past railroad box cars and freight wagons being stacked with

buffalo hides
Nearby more buffalo carcasses

A mountain of buffalo heads

98

To one side a huge PYRE Flames leaping into the air

CUT TO

INT DURAND TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 99
Like a mining town CROWDED chaotic
In one corner a saloon

Out front Farley Surrounded by his men

FARLEY
(sees Kidd)
Well don’t you look mighty fine
Captain
KIDD

Where do you want me
FARLEY
(drinks )
Them’s your audience
Kidd looks at the crowd Drunk Oblivious
He leads Johanna to an open barn

Lays out his newspapers on a bench

Johanna picks up the dime pot Takes it defiantly out into
the crowd

JOHANNA
DIME-AH

Before Kidd can react Bad Ass hands him a newspaper

BAD ASS
Mr Farley says to read this

Kidd looks at it The Erath Journal

On the front page an etching of Farley surrounded by
buffalo heads A bunch of Native American scalps in his hand

Meanwhile across the square Johanna reaches Farley
JOHANNA
(holds out the pot)
DIME-AH

Farley looks right across at Kidd

99

A moment between them
He drops it in the pot

KIDD
Good Evening ladies and gentlemen
my name
(forced to shout over the
noise)
Ladies and gentlemen

A few turned heads

KIDD (CONTD)
My name’s Captain Kidd and Mr
Farley has asked me to come here
tonight to read y’all the news

More interest

KIDD (CONTD)

Now I always start my readings with
something local And Mr Farley has
kindly given me this copy of the
Erath Journal which I must confess
I’m not familiar with

(he turns the pages More

Farley etchings more

scalps)
Sure looks like Mr Farley is a busy
man in these parts A businessman
A law giver There’s the buffalo a
profitable business for sure The
timber the clearing of the
plains And all of you fine folk
working for him at that Sun-up to
sun-down The way I see it none
of that is news Isn’t that right
Mr Farley

He looks across at Farley

KIDD (CONTD)
So let me see if I can’t tempt you
with something else Harper’s
Illustrated have a story
(retrieves it)
Reporting from the lonely little
town of Keel Run Pennsylvania Now
Keel Run ain’t known for much - I’m
counting none of y’all here has
heard of it And why should you
It’s in the North for starters
(few grins)
(MORE )

99 99
KIDD (CONTD)
Just one of a thousand towns ‘cross
our nation birthed by the work of
many but enjoyed by the few

See Farley Where’s this going

KIDD (CONTD)

Now Keel Run don’t trade in
buffalo but in coal But just like
you every morning its men rise
early from their beds only to
descend into the great mine that
runs like a labyrinth beneath their
homes

(more people listening)
“On the morning of February 11th
thirty men of the Run” did just as
this and come noon everything was
as it should be and always had
been Hard hard labouring But
before the next hour was up Keel
Run’s wheel of fortune had turned
For the mine was on fire

See his audience hooked Farley watching intently

Johanna too Watching the impact of Kidd’s story on the
crowd

KIDD (CONTD)

Now according to Harper’s here
“The fire started in the eastern
shaft and spread fast back through
the mine carried by the pull of air
working its way to the surface
Building and building Into a
raging inferno” A beast devouring
everything that dare stand in its
way

(beat)
Now you and I can only imagine the
fear those thirty men felt The
first dozen died within minutes
Another seven not long after

(beat)
But I’m not here to tell y’all the
story of those unfortunate souls
Or of the mine owner who’d been so
lax about their safety Sitting up
there in his fancy home No I’m
here to tell you about the eleven
men who lived The eleven men who
fought back to escape their fate 99

FARLEY
Thought I told you to read from the
Erath Captain

KIDD
Well see I was wondering if folks
might prefer some storytelling from
places outside of Erath Just for
tonight

FARLEY
Think you should read the Erath all
the same Captain Sorta thing
these people expect to hear

KIDD
Sure seems a shame to miss the
opportunity Mr Farley
(turns to the crowd)
How’s about we vote on it I can
read this here Journal Or I can
keep on with the story of Keel Run

A beat then

OLD MAN
Id ‘preciate hearin’ about the men
of that Run

Agreement in the audience Voices growing in confidence

JOHANNA
Stor-ee Stor-ee

KIDD

Well all right then

(sees Farley talking to

Bad Ass)
That day those eleven men were
facing a mortal enemy Intent on
destroying everything they ever
cared about Everything they’d
built

(sees Farley’s men move

into the crowd)
Every pillar of progress and
civilization

BAD ASS

(roughly pushing)
Show’s over folks 99

KIDD
(faster now)
Well I’1l tell ya those men
refused defeat In the dark they
kept their heads Worked together
Fought back against the odds For
better lives And for freedom
PEOPLE begin to protest Scuffles

BAD ASS
Get on out

KIDD
Ill keep reading folks Long as
you want me to

And then it kicks off Farley’s men against townsfolk
Townsfolk against Farley’s men

Kidd sees Johanna out in the crowd Kicking one of Farleys
men

Then she’s knocked over The dime pot spilling in the dust
He pushes through towards her
Grabs her hand just in time

CUT TO

EXT DURAND STREET - NIGHT 100
Kidd and Johanna walking fast
Behind them the sound of fighting Gunshots

Ahead Farley GOONS coming back into town to quell the
trouble some on horse back

Kidd avoids them

CUT TO

EXT DURAND NEAR THE RAILROAD CARS NIGHT 101
Kidd and Johanna approach the railroad cars
Kidd sees ahead more Farley GOONS

He pulls Johanna into a railroad car

101 101

They press themselves into the shadows as the GOONS pass

They stumble through the railroad car buffalo carcasses
either side

Then climb down and make their way towards camp

CUT TO

102 EXT DURAND CAMP - NIGHT 102
They reach the camp
Johanna climbs into the wagon As Kidd hitches the horses
Kidd sees the damaged wheel Looks bad No time to fix it
Suddenly the sound of a gun being cocked
Kidd turns to see Farley’s gun trained on him
Next to him Bad Ass

FARLEY
You shoulda just read Captain

KIDD
Just giving them a choice Mr
Farley

Farley throws down the copy of the Erath Journal

FARLEY
Well you can read now
(beat)
Seems like you need the education

KIDD
I travel plenty Just figure this
is my land too

FARLEY
Then y’all know it’s disputed And
this here is the frontline We
gotta deal with all what threatens
us Mexicans Reds Blacks Yanks
don’t matter all the same

Back in the wagon Johanna opens the gun box

KIDD
We gotta stop fighting some time

102

FARLEY
We will When it’s ours alone

Johanna carefully pulls out the revolver
Farley motions to Bad Ass who grabs Kidd
And Farley punches him square in the guts
As Johanna opens the ammo box

One round left

Farley punches Kidd again

Kidd falls to the ground

Farley kicks him

Kidd on his knees

FARLEY (CONTD)
You ready to read Captain

KIDD
(spitting blood)
Killing me won’t get you heard

Farley lifts the gun
Kidd stares Farley down
He’s about to pull the trigger when
BANG
Farley staggers backwards
Kidd looks over
Johanna Gun raised
She turns the gun on Bad Ass
CLICK
Bad Ass realises She’s out
Slowly pulls up his gun

KIDD (CONTD)
No

When suddenly - 102

BANG
And Bad Ass drops too
Kidd wheels around
John Calley in the shadows Gun in hand
Watches Farley coughing blood Moving towards his gun
BANG
Calley shoots him dead
JOHN CALLEY
(holds out Kidd’s
newspapers )
I like your stories You need keep
tellin’ them
See Kidd
He goes to Johanna
She’s looking at the slumped bodies
He carefully takes the gun
KIDD
(then to Calley)
Get in

A handful of LABOURERS in the shadows watching them leave

CUT TO

EXT WAGON - CONTINUOUS 103
Kidd driving fast

Calley gun poised watching the darkness behind

Kidd looks back at Johanna

She at him

A moment

Kidd knows he’s brought killing back to her door

CUT TO

EXT WAGON CENTRAL PLAINS - DAY 104
Still on the move Slower now

Calley sits next to Kidd cleaning his gun

The SOUND of that broken wheel

Kidd glances back at Johanna

She’s looking out at the wide plains

JOHN CALLEY
I ain’t never heard of news reading
as a thing a man could do

KIDD
It’s no rich man’s occupation
that’s for sure Not in Texas

anyways

JOHN CALLEY
So why’d you bother

KIDD
That’s a long story

JOHN CALLEY
Seems like we got all day

KIDD
Well I was a printer by trade
Before Had a works Down in San
Antonio Hot metal and black ink
it’s a beautiful thing to see what
they can make

Kidd pauses his expression shifting

KIDD (CONTD)
One night this story came in for
printing Saying a Virginian man -
a businessman of sorts - had
arrived in Mississippi intent on
raising hell among the slaves down
there Of arming them no less

JOHN CALLEY
Sounds ‘bout right for them damn
Yankees

KIDD
Yeah well I printed it And it
stirred up a hell of its own
(MORE)

Kidd looks

KIDD (CONTD)

People up and raging about it

(beat)
Couple of days later more news
came This Virginian had been
caught Dragged from a coach And
beaten to death
(beat)
Only it turned out it wasn’t true
He was just down there trying to
sell some shoes That’s all Just
shoes
(beat)
Well I saw them lies come thick and
fast after that From both sides
Printed more than my fair share
And War followed as I knew it
would

down at the wheel

KIDD (CONTD)

After the killing was over and I
came home There was no print
works I lost everything Same as
everyone

(beat)
But print was in my blood I guess
Eventually I got to thinking
Maybe I should do my own readings
Maybe if we had the truth of things
laid out clearly we’d be less
inclined to pick up our guns
again

(beat)
That was the idea anyway

JOHN CALLEY
Well way I now it don’t look like
that’s been working so well

KIDD
Guess not

Kidd looks back at Johanna She meets his look Knows

Calley sees Puts down his gun

KIDD (CONTD)
Then again maybe I just like
stories

JOHN CALLEY

(nodding to Johanna)
She kin

See Calley 104

KIDD
No She was orphaned by the Kiowa
down in Hill Country They took her
North I’m taking her back to her
living relatives

JOHN CALLEY
So why you the one takin’ her

KIDD
Something I can do I guess

thinking on this

JOHN CALLEY
I’m reckonin’ we killed some Kiowa
recent All sorta look the same
though I’1ll tell ya they were mad
as hell for us shootin’ up them
cows

KIDD
They need the buffalo to survive

JOHN CALLEY
Guessin’ that’s why Mr Farley liked
killin’ em It’s sure good
business Dollar for a head at
least

This sits there Calley embarrassed

KIDD
So what you gonna do now

JOHN CALLEY
Find some place where there’s work
Tommy always talked ‘bout fixin’ on
the railroad

KIDD
Well I’d say Tommy had it right
Gonna be a lot more railroads
coming
(beat)
You should go Make something of
your own

See Calley considering this new future

JOHN CALLEY
Well how ‘bout that

Kidd looks down at that tapping wheel again

104 104

JOHN CALLEY (CONTD)
So how about you What’u gonna do
when you fetched her back

KIDD
Oh I don’t know

JOHN CALLEY
You got family and all

KIDD

JOHN CALLEY
(laughing)
Well she sure must be the merciful
type I’m thinkin’ you need to go
down there an show her a little
‘ppreciation

KIDD
Maybe I should at that

CUT TO

105 EXT PLAINS WATER HOLE - NIGHT 105
A hard wind
A cluster of WAGONS camped
Calley by the fire
Johanna lying under a blanket
Kidd kneeling beside the wagon Fixing the damaged wheel
Kidd straightens up Looks across the dark plains
A distant flash of lightning
He looks over at Johanna

She’s looking over at a line of large white Conestoga wagons
Their canvases moving in the wind

Slap slap slap

Kidd sees those distant memories cross her face again like
clouds on the plain turning the prairie grass black

KIDD
You want some water
(beat)
Johanna
She turns away from him
JOHN CALLEY

You sure she ain’t gone in the
head

Johanna looks across at the wagons The canvas flapping in

the wind

Sees the faces in the back WOMEN CHILDREN

Faces of hardship Wonder Fear

Again we see something stirring in her

106 106

JOHN CALLEY (CONTD)
Least ways you could wait ona
wagon train - stead of ridin’

alone

KIDD
Don’t seem to be many heading that
way

Calley takes out his gun Empties the bullets into his palm
Holds them out

JOHN CALLEY
Take ‘em for her at least

A beat Kidd takes the bullets

JOHN CALLEY (CONTD)
(beat)
Say Cap those men holed up in
that mine They really beat that
fire and get home

KIDD

(leans down hands him the
copy of Harper’s
Illustrated)
See it’s printed right there in
black and white
JOHN CALLEY
(looks down at it)
Well Goddamn ain’t that something

Kidd turns back
The looming hills ahead
And Johanna waiting for him

On Kidd

JOHANNA
Dime’ ah

KIDD
No dime’ah

And they move off

CUT TO

EXT WAGON HILL COUNTRY - DAY 107
Mythic

Steep valleys High plateaus Sharp ravines Markedly
different from any place they’ve been

Kidd alert to danger

Sees a string of caves in the bluffs high above

Is there movement up there

Johanna sees the caves too She knows what they are
Kidd pulls the gun towards him

KIDD
Let’s practice that song shall we

She looks over at him

KIDD (CONTD)

Kidd still riding Up hill now

Beside him Johanna watching the valley below

Kidd scans the horizon

Dust clouds

CUT TO

Familiar

EXT WOODLAND HILL COUNTRY - DAY 112
They enter woodland Ancient distinctive trees
Dense shadows

They turn a corner

A tree lying across the track

Kidd slows Scans the area It could be a trap
He parks up

Climbs out the wagon Revolver out

Walks over to the tree

Back in the wagon Johanna takes out Kidd’s knife
Watches Kidd as he begins moving the trunk

She gets out to help

KIDD
Get back

Beat on Johanna She looks down the road ahead of them

Then to the left at the distinctive shapes of the ancient
oaks

KIDD (CONTD)
(in Kiowa)

Finally she complies
Kidd clears a path
Gets back in the wagon
Drives the horses on anxious to get to a safer place

Johanna still watching those trees as they pass

CUT TO

EXT PLATEAU HILL COUNTRY - AFTERNOON 113
Now they’re out in the endless windswept plateau again

A blasted earth as far as the eye can see

Kidd working hard to keep the horses moving
That damaged wheel groaning
Then a CLUNK
KIDD
(looking down at the
wheel)
Damn fixing’s

He stops the wagon Gets out Starts to work on the bolts
Johanna sits wind in her face
Then gets out the wagon
Kidd watches as she walks ahead

A tiny figure under a big sky

KIDD (CONTD)
Not too far

See Johanna looking intently around
She begins singing quietly
Keeps walking As though retracing old steps
KIDD (CONTD)
We have to go
(in Kiowa)
Getting dark soon
She ignores him
Eventually she reaches a track leading away to the left
Kidd gets back in the wagon Starts after her
Sees the track too
Johanna still singing
KIDD (CONTD)
We’re just gonna stay on the main
road now you hear

She looks at him Stops singing

He makes the sign of the straight line 113

KIDD (CONTD)
(in Kiowa)
Not safe Here
She shakes her head And points down the track
JOHANNA
(in Kiowa)

This way

KIDD
We haven’t got time for this

She looks at him Points again
JOHANNA
(in English)
We go
Kidd knows what this is He’s been dreading it for days

She walks off down the track

Johanna walking ahead

Down a small incline which reveals in the distance

An abandoned wooden shack

CUT TO

Close on the shack as they approach

Everything about this - the wide open space the sky -
reminds us of something Something deeply rooted in our
imagination

The opening of The Searchers

CUT TO

EXT SEARCHERS CABIN - CONTINUOUS 116
Kidd watches as ahead
Johanna stops
The wind buffeting her
The shack ahead
Ruined
To one side The skeleton of a wagon

can still leave

Beat on Johanna

No
She enters
CUT TO
INT SEARCHERS CABIN - CONTINUOUS 117

Johanna enters the shack

Kidd after her

A plain living area

Broken furniture Broken windows

Blackened by fire

And everywhere the signs of savage violence
Bullet marks

Arrows

And dark blood stains

Johanna moves through it Kidd behind her

She goes to the end of the room

117

A door

Through it a small room

Shutters long since fallen from their hinges

The sounds of wind outside

Johanna looks around

Three beds A double A child’s bed A cot

She goes to the child’s bed

Reaches down

Finds under an upturned drawer the remains of a corn doll

CUT TO

EXT SEARCHERS CABIN - CONTINUOUS 118
Johanna holding the doll walks outside again

Looks around

Her eyes tell the story

This is where they ran where they hid where she was taken
Kidd looking at Johanna Watching her remember it all

She turns to Kidd As if she has found everything she needed

JOHANNA
(bravely)
Mama Papa tot
KIDD

Yes They’re dead
See Johanna Taking it in A small nod
She walks up to Kidd Takes his arm Holds it close
On Kidd Doesn’t know what to say

It’s not good Going back

He looks at her certainty Her bravery
As they reach the top of the slope and start to go down
KIDD
Well I only know the straight
line That’s the only way I know
Suddenly a CRACK
The wagon lurches violently as the wheel finally gives way
Kidd tries to control the horses
But they panic as the wagon tips

Kidd can’t hold it

KIDD (CONTD)
Johanna jump Jump

She does And at the last minute so does he

As the cart tumbles forty feet into a hidden canyon Smashing
into the rocks below

CUT TO

120 EXT CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT 120
Kidd and Johanna scramble down the rocks
They reach the wreckage of the wagon
ONE HORSE DEAD THE OTHER INJURED and in distress
Kidd has no choice
He shoots it
The canyon falls quiet
Kidd goes to the wagon
Salvages what he can
Food Water
And last his wife’s photo Damaged but still intact

He turns back

120

Sees Johanna crouching over the dead horses Marking their
passing with a Kiowa ritual

CUT TO

An endless hard road

He lifts her on to her exhausted feet

Gives her the last biscuit

CUT TO

That never ceasing wind

Kidd leading her Johanna tucked behind his body for shelter
They stumble forward Exhausted

CUT TO

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS - MIDDAY SUN 125

They lie in a tiny pool of shade Utterly spent

The last of the water gone

Kidd looks over at Johanna

Trying to find the words to prepare her
He stands

Lifts her into his arms

And keeps walking

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS - LATE AFTERNOON
Still that wind

Kidd carrying Johanna now Her eyes closed
Kidd reaching the edge of exhaustion

One small step after another

Suddenly he sees something on the horizon
He tries to focus

Is that a horse

It looks like a horse

CUT TO

He takes a few steps towards it but carrying Johanna is

slowing him down
He gently lowers her to the ground
KIDD
(voice hoarse)
Horse
He stumbles forwards
Towards the shape
Johanna opens her eyes
JOHANNA
(voice hoarse)

Kep-tan

Kidd is twenty yards ahead now

126

The shape ahead of him dancing up a ridge
Kidd follows

Further and further from Johanna

Ahead A LOW RUMBLING SOUND

Getting louder with every step

As it reaches the top of the ridge the horse shape
disperses Just a DUST DEVIL

Kidd walks a few paces on

Still that building sound

He reaches the crest of the ridge

To reveal

A MASSIVE SANDSTORM

Roaring towards them through the gloom

Kidd turns back to Johanna

Sees her standing there alone

KIDD

gohannal

He starts to run back to her

As the sandstorm engulfs them both

CUT TO

EXT SOUTHERN PLAINS - CONTINUOUS 127
A deafening tsunami of dust

Hammering into Kidd

He tries to shout but his voice is drowned out

He struggles back to where he left her

Near blind Barely able to see two feet ahead

Throat filling with dust Lungs suffocated

He searches Desperate

Occasionally glimpsing the landscape ahead
Then he’s in darkness

A phantom in the dust

He stumbles

Gets up stumbles again

We watch him struggle to his feet
Desperate to find her

Then he starts to slow

Losing strength with every step

He falls to his knees

See despair in his eyes

Momentarily the dust clears a few yards ahead
He sees a rise in the ground

He crawls forward

Drives his hands into the dust Heaving it away Digging
an animal With his last strength

And then he finds her
Curled up for protection
He drags her up
Frantically wipes her face
Pulls her into his chest

KIDD
Thank God Thank God

And we see what this means to him
Then he looks up
And sees to his horror

Through the gloom ahead

like 127

They’re not alone

Ghostly shapes are moving towards them
Slowly they become clear

A BAND OF KIOWA INDIANS

Some on HORSEBACK and others on foot
Kidd pulls out his gun

But as they come closer he sees
They’re not warriors They’re refugees
Looking for survival just like them
Kidd lets the gun drop to the ground
Johanna walks forward towards them

Through the eddies of dust Kidd watches as she talks with a
GROUP OF KIOWA WOMEN

SEVERAL MEN join the group

Then an OLD MAN THE CHIEF

Kidd sees Johanna climbs onto a horse

The Chief turns to look at him

Kidd watches as Johanna talks to the Chief

And then she turns and rides back towards Kidd
She reaches him Hands him water

As the tribe prepares to move on

As they leave Kidd comes face-to-face with The Chief
A moment between them

A look of shared history Of what might have been
And then the Kiowa disappear into the haze

Kidd climbs onto the horse

And they ride on 127

you could have done The doctor
said

Cholera alone can’t explain it
Four years of war and killing
Every day waiting to come home And
when I got back to her six days
Just six days to talk and dream of
family And then I woke and she was
gone

BRANHOLME
It was sickness man Just
sickness

KIDD

That wasn’t sickness It was
judgement For what I’d seen and
what I’d done I saw her cold in
the bed and I knew God’s curse on
me had killed her

So I left her and ran

His shame laid bare

On Kidd

BRANHOLME

I’ve known you 50 years Since we
were boys We didn’t ask for any of
it But when division came it fell
to us to do the fighting I try not
to look back at any of it but when
I do I’m lying out there bleeding
in the smoke I was dying And I
remember thinking if I ever get
through this If the cards fall
that way whatever happens I will
make sure I make life worth the
living And then I saw you coming
You picked me up and got me to
shelter

(beat)
Youre no coward Jeffrey You saved
me I lived She died That’s not
Judgement That’s not Providence
It’s just what we have to face and
carry the rest of our days

waiting for you Been waiting for
five years To tell you to forgive
yourself

“Three days ago In Baton Rouge
Louisiana A Mr Alfred Blackstone
of 47 years fell into a stupor
His wife called a physician but
there being no pulse it was
determined that Mr Blackstone was
most unfortunately dead And
buried swiftly that very evening
in the grounds of the local
church”

(looks up)
Where - as divine providence would
have it - a wedding was due to
take place the following day

(reading)
“A little after noon the expectant
bride made her way through the
grounds As inside her groom
waited But nearing the church
doors the bride Abruptly
Stopped”

(looks up)
Reconsidering perhaps Perhaps
not

(continues reading)
“For in the cemetery beyond she
had heard an inexplicable sound”

JOHANNA
(banging)
BANG BANG BANG

KIDD

The desperate unmistakable
hammering of life

(reading again)
“In a state of frantic excitement
she ran to a nearby grave and
within moments the entire wedding
congregation was digging”

Laughter at the absurdity

KIDD (CONTD)
“The bride in all her splendor
thigh deep in mud The Reverend
beside her crying to God Almighty
for Mr Blackstone’s salvation And
the grieving Mrs Blackstone also
For she had been summoned

(MORE) 149
KIDD (CONTD)
All digging As finally Poor
Alfred Blackstone was pulled from
the earth Confused by the sight
before him but very much alive
And from Mrs Blackstone’s embrace
Alfred turned to the groom and
said
“Feller when you get in that
church and she says ‘Til Death us
do part’”
(beat)

“Don’t you believe a word of it”

Everyone laughing
