PICKED UP

LYNNE IS JUST ABOUT TO SPEAK AGAIN WHEN A SHORT BURST OF
HEAVY RASPINGLY OBSCENE BREATHING COMES FROM HER RECEIVER
ITS FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE STATIC SNAP OF SOMEONE
RELEASING THE TALK BUTTON THE RADIO IS ONCE AGAIN SILENT

THE TWO WOMEN STARE AT THE SET AS IF IT WERE ALIVE

LYNNE
(quietly)
What the hell was that

ETHEL SITS BACK STILL STARING AT THE RADIO

LYNNE

LYNNE TURNS AND LOOKS TOWARD THE DARK WINDOWS THE ORANGE
LIGHT OF THE BONFIRE LICKING HER FEATURES

EXT NEAR THE TRAILER -- DUSK 25
THE LIGHT AT THE HORIZON HAS GONE FROM SCARLET TO DEEP PURPLE
THAT TATTERS OFF TO GRAY THE REST OF THE SKY PRESSES DOWN

HER VOICE RETURNS AT INTERVALS FROM THE HIGH STONE
BUTTRESSES BUT THERES NO ANSWER FROM HER BROTHER THE
GIRL STARES AT THE DARK TREES AND THE SLOPE THAT RUNS UP
BEHIND AND TAKES A TENTATIVE STEP IN THEIR DIRECTION THEN
STOPS

SHE THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE HEARD SOMETHING

THE BEAST LETS OUT A WHUFF AND POINTS HIS EARS A MOMENT
LATER HE CHARGES WITHOUT WARNING INTO THE DARK TREES YANKING
BRENDA OFF BALANCE

HE TUGS THE BEAST AFTER HIM THE BIG DOG SEEMS TO WANT TO
HEAD BACK INTO THE WOODS

CUT TO A SHOT THROUGH SOME BRUSH TO THE DISTANT TRAILER AND
BONFIRE WHERE LYNNE AND ETHEL HEAP MORE FUEL ONTO THE
FLAMES A SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE CAMERA PUTS MORE BRANCHES
BETWEEN US AND THE VIEW OF THE FIRE ESTABLISHING THIS AS THE
POINT OF VIEW OF SOMEONE IN HIDING

BRENDA BOBBY AND THE BEAST ENTER THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT
THEY ARE GREETED BY THE TWO OLDER WOMEN BOBBY WITH SPECIAL
WARMTH ALL ARE TOO FAR AWAY TO BE HEARD THEIR GESTURES
INDICATE THAT THEY ARE RELIEVED PUZZLED ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF
THE MEN BOBBY IS GIVEN A COAT

AND HE SHUTS THE DOOR BEHIND HIM

BRENDA
Hes such a Macho

SHE PULLS BACK A CURTAIN AND STRAINS TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE
DARK OUTSIDE

EXT OUTSIDE THE TRAILER -- NIGHT 28

THE FIRE IS DOWN TO EMBERS THAT OFFER SCANT LIGHT BUT A
GREENISH EMBOLUS OF A MOON HOVERS IN THE SKY NOW RISING
SLOWLY AS A GAS BUBBLE IN THICK ACID THIS IS LIGHT ENOUGH
FOR BOBBY TO SEE THAT THE BEAST HAS BROKEN HIS CHAIN AND IS
GONE

BOBBY LOOKS OFF INTO THE DARK SHIVERING SUDDENLY HE
SWALLOWS AND LOOKS UP AT THE SKY

BOBBY

ROCKS CUTS OF HIM CLIMBING CLIMBING UNTIL HE REACHES THE
VERY TOP OF THE OUTCROPPING HIGH ABOVE THE ROAD AND TRAILER
WHERE BEAUTY MET HER MATCH

THE BEAST TRACES BACK AND FORTH AMONG THE STILL HOT SCENT
MAPS OF THE STRUGGLE GETTING MADDER AND MADDER

( )

HE REACHES THE PLATE OF ROCK AND LEAPS UP ONTO IT RIGHT INTO
THE MIDDLE OF THE ENTRAILS OF BEAUTY

THE HUGE DOGS SPINS AROUND IN TIGHT CIRCLES SNIFFING AND

SNORTING AND GROWLING MORE AND MORE THEN SITS BACK ON HIS
POWERFUL HAUNCHES AND LETS OUT A LONG ANGRY HOWL JUTTING
HIS SNOUT RIGHT AT THE UNDERBELLY OF THE MOON

THERE IS NO SIGN HOWEVER OF THE REST OF BEAUTY
EXT A ROCK OVERHANG -- NIGHT 30

THE HOWL OF THE BEAST IS NOW DISTANT A FAINT TEAR IN THE
FABRIC OF QUIET PAN DOWN FROM A SHOT OF THE CRATERED MOON
TO A SMALL COOKING FIRE ON A CRUDE SPIT THE CHARRED HAUNCH
OF SOME SOFT OF ANIMAL CRACKLES PAN RIGHT UNTIL WITH A
SUDDENNESS THAT IS ALMOST SURPRISING THE FACE OF A YOUNG
WOMAN PERHAPS 19 FILLS THE FRAME HER DARK TANGLE OF HAIR
IS PLAITED WITH DRIED DESERT FLOWERS AND A THIN BRASS CHAIN
OF THE SORT FOUND IN INDUSTRIAL OR MILITARY USE

HER FACE IS BURNED DARK BY THE SUN HER EYES DARK EVEN WITH
THE MOON IN THEM HER MOUTH WIDE YET WITH A REFINEMENT THAT
IS IN NO WAY MIRRORED BY THE ROUGH CLOTHING SHE WEARS AGAINST
THE COLD

BUT SHE IS UNMISTAKABLY BEAUTIFUL

AS THE HOWL IN THE DISTANCE DIES THE GIRL TURNS THOUGHTFULLY
BACK TO THE FIRE AND STUDIES THE HEAT BURNING THERE SHE
LOOKS BACK INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND HER LISTENING NO SOUND
BUT A LOW SCRAPING OF WIND

SHE TAKES THE MEAT FROM THE FIRE AND BEGINS TO EAT ITS A
LONG SHANK TOUGH AND FIBROUS SHE TEARS AT IT WITH HER
TEETH CHEWS AND STARES INTO THE FIRE

THE BEAST HOWLS AGAIN A LONG HAUNTING ULULATION THE
GIRLS EYES COME UP SHE DROPS THE MEAT INTO THE FIRE SPITS
OUT WHATS IN HER MOUTH STANDS AND WIPES HER HANDS ON HER
RAGGED SKIRT LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER IN MOUNTING ALARM

A RUDDY LIGHT FALLS OVER HER FROM BEHIND AND THE GIRL TURNS
IN SOME RELIEF CUT TO AN ENORMOUS FIGURE COMING THROUGH A
FLAP OF ANIMAL SKIN FROM A FIRE-LIT INNER CHAMBER OF ROCK

AS THE FIGURE DRAWS CLOSER TO THE COOKING FIRE WE CAN SEE IT
IS A WOMAN HUGE SMOKEY ROUGH SKIN PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED
POUNDS IN WEIGHT A SNARL OF HAIR BONE ORNAMENTS CARTRIDGE

CLOSE UP ON A THICK PINE TRUNK AS AN AX BITES OUT BIG CHIPS
THERES A SHARP CRACK AND THE TREE BEGINS TO FALL CUT TO A
WIDE SHOT OF THE TREE CRASHING DOWN AND SEVERAL DARK SAVAGE
FORMS RUNNING FOR COVER THE TREE SMASHES INTO THE GROUND

CUT TO THE TREE HAVING ITS BRANCHES AXED OFF BY SHOUTING AND
LAUGHING YOUNG SAVAGES BOTH MALE AND FEMALE WE RECOGNIZE
ONE OF THE AXES AS THE ONE STOLEN FROM THE TRAILER BY PLUTO

EXT OUTSIDE THE CAVE -- PRE-DAWN 86
PLUTO PASSES OUT OF THE HIDE-FLAPPED CAVE UNDER CAMOUFLAGE
NETTING AND RUNS TO HELP WITH THE TIPPING UP AND STEPPING OF
THE TALL PINE MAST

IN AN ASIDE WE SEE MARS INSTRUCT ONE YOUNG SAVAGE TO GO
TAKE OVER FOR MERCRY THE SAVAGE DEPARTS OUR ATTENTION
GOES BACK TO THE TREE RAISING

ITS A VERY ARDUOUS DIFFICULT TASK BUT WITHIN MINUTES THE
THING IS SET AND MADE SECURE

( )

ALL UP ITS LENGTH ARE STRANGE AND COLORFUL DECORATIONS
COLORED BUNTING MADE FROM STAINED BANDAGING BRANCHES OF
FLOWERING WILDWOOD AND AT THE VERY TOP WE SEE AS WE ZOOM IN
CLOSE THE DARK CHARRED HEAD OF BIG BOB FACE FROZEN IN A
TERRIBLE GRIMACE OF OUTRAGE

THERES A GENERAL ROUND OF CHEERING AMONG THE SAVAGES AND
BOTTLE OF EXPENSIVE WHISKY ARE CIRCULATING FREELY ALONG WITH
EARTHEN VIALS OF STRANGE POWDERS THAT ARE MIXED WITH THE
DRINKS

MANY SEEM ALREADY TO BE IN A SORT OF TRANCE EYES GLAZED
NOSES STREAMING GREENISH STRINGS OF THICK MUCOUS

EXT MERCURYS OUTPOST -- DAWN 87

HIGH ABOVE THE FOREST FLOOR THE SAVAGE DIRECTED BY MARS TO
RELIEVE MERCURY ARRIVES AT THE LOOKOUT POINT HE FINDS
MERCURY GONE HE CASTS ABOUT AND FINDS THE PRINTS OF BOTH
MERCURY THEN THE BIG PAW PRINTS OF THE BEAST

THE YOUNG SAVAGE SMELLS THE BUSH WHERE THE BEAST PISSED HIS
SIGNATURE CURSES PULLS OUT HIS KNIFE AND CUTS THE BUSH AWAY
FROM ITS ROOTS SAVAGELY FLINGING IT OVER THE EDGE OF THE
CLIFF

AS HE FOLLOWS IT DOWN HE SEES THE BODY OF MERCURY FAR
BELOW ON THE ROCKS HIS FACE REGISTERS ACUTE PAIN AND HE
RACES FOR THE TRAIL DOWN

EXT THE ROCKS BELOW -- DAWN 88

THE SAVAGE RUNS UP TO MERCURY FINDS HIM OBVIOUSLY DEAD THE
SAVAGE WHOSE NAME IS NEPTUNE LETS OUT A TERRIBLE HOWL OF
RAGE AND PAIN THEN CASTS ABOUT FOR THE RADIO HE CANT FIND
IT OF COURSE HE STRUGGLE WITH THE BODY OF MERCURY UNTIL HE
HAS IT OVER HIS SHOULDER THEN GOES OFF TOWARDS THE TRAIL
BACK TO HIS CAMP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

EXT NEAR THE BURNED-OUT TREE -- EARLY MORNING 89
THE TREE STILL SMOLDERS TRAILING A PLUME OF YELLOW-WHITE
SMOKE UP INTO THE EARLY HAZE OF MORNING BOBBY AND DOUG
ARRIVE WITH A BLANKET AND POLES A MAKESHIFT LITTER

THEY PAUSE AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE FLIES SWARM UP FROM THE
ENTRAILS OF BIG BOB THE BODY OF COURSE IS GONE

BOBBY
I dont believe this

( )

DOUG
They must have come back and taken him in
the night

HE STARES AT THE GUTS FOR A MOMENT THEN FORCES HIMSELF TO
TAKE HIS EYES AWAY HE SEES BOBS CLOTHING IN A HEAP BEHIND
THE TREE

DOUG GOES OVER AND PICKS UP THE CLOTHES THOUGHTFULLY
DROPPING THEM BACK DOWN SOMETHING MAKES A METALLIC CLINK
DOUG STOOPS AND MOVES THE CLOTHES UNTIL HE FINDS BOBS
TROUSERS FROM THE POCKETS HE REMOVES A WALLET SOME CHANGE
AND A SINGLE KEY

DOUG GIVES THE EFFECTS OF BIG BOB TO BOBBY AND IMMEDIATELY
HEADS BACK FOR THE TRAILER BOBBY CATCHES UP WITH HIM THE
CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE ON THE RUN

BOBBY
Why would they want his body This is
crazy

DOUG

Recognize the key

BOBBY
(ignoring)
Do you think we might have gotten
ourselves into the middle of some kind of
Army maneuvers I mean maybe theyre
some kind of Special Forces gone nuts
maybe they dont realize who we are

DOUG
(sardonically)
Oh Who are we

BOBBY
(with frightened logic)
Americans Civilians for gosh sakes
They arent supposed to go around burning
and raping and kidnapping us just
because we try to sneak into California
without a pass

DOUG HAS NO ANSWER FOR THAT THEY HAVE REACHED THE TRAILER
WHICH IS GUARDED BY THE BEAST ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM THE
DOOR OF THE TRAILER ARE TWO GRAVES SCOOPED OUT OF THE SANE
NEXT TO ONE WRAPPED IN A SHEET IS THE CORPSE OF LYNNE
DOUG GOES TO HER

( )

DOUG
(to Bobby)
Give us some help would you

BOBBY HELPS DOUG LOWER LYNNE INTO THE GRAVE DOUG OPENS THE
SHEET TO TAKE HIS FINAL LOOK LYNNES FACE IS DARK RED AND
TWISTED IN A SNARL OF PAIN EVEN HER EYES DULL AND WHITE
REMAIN OPEN DOUG IS CLEARLY SHAKEN WITH GREAT EFFORT HE
STEADIES HIS HAND ENOUGH TO CLOSE HER EYES THEN HE WRAPS
HER FROM THE LIGHT IN THE SHEET HIS FACE IS ASHEN

HE CLIMBS FROM THE GRAVE THERES NO SHOVEL SO HE BEGINS
FILLING THE GRAVE THE SAME WAY HE EMPTIED IT WITH HIS
HANDS

CUT TO THE DOORWAY OF THE TRAILER BRENDA LEANS FROM THE
DOOR ENOUGH TO WATCH HIS EXPRESSION IS ONE OF MUTED HORROR
BLANK YET VOLATILE

BOBBY KNEELS AND BEGINS HELPING PUSH THE EARTH INTO THE HOLE

CUT TO THE BEAST HE PLOPS DOWN HIS EYES ON THE GRAVE
LOWERING HIS BIG HEAD UNTIL IT RESTS ON THE SAND BETWEEN HIS
PAWS

DOUG SITS UP THE GRAVE IS FILLED DOUG LOOKS AT THE
BEAST THE BEAST RAISES HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE ANIMATES
TO INTENT READINESS

DOUG
Ready old boy

THE BEAST WAGS HIS TAIL AND WHINES ONCE DOUG STANDS UP
AND BRUSHES OFF HIS TROUSERS THE BEAST IS IMMEDIATELY ON
HIS FEET RUSHING AROUND PANTING AND WHUFFING EAGER TO GET
GOING HE SMELLS THE HUNT DOUG TURNS TO BOBBY

DOUG

BOBBY
Are you serious Follow that clown
Hell lead you down every gopher hole in
the state before hell take you to
Shanti And what about me Youre

out kid sister -- what if they come back

( )

THIS LINE OF QUESTIONS IS HURLED AT DOUG AS DOUG GOES ABOUT
GATHERING THE ARMY CB A JAR OF WATER A SPACE JACKET OF
SUPERTHIN ALUMINIZED MYLAR AND LAST ALMOST RELUCTANTLY
PLUTOS KNIFE HE STOPS IN FRONT OF BOBBY

DOUG
If they come back youll have your hands
full no sense kidding ourselves But
you should have plenty of warning The
way theyve been talking on the CB
through the night its clear they dont
know we have one of their units

Ive set our CB to the same channel 38
Every half hour or so you should call for
help on the military channels -- the ones
theyre not using

BOBBY
What makes you think theres anybody
except these guys around

DOUG
Look theres no way the people who hit
us are Army yet they have Army
equipment And its battery operated so
they cant have had it too long

BOBBY
So youre saying they stole it or
something

DOUG

Or found it or something Ill stay in
touch with you every fifteen minutes on

the quarter hour The rest of the time

Ill be monitoring their channel If I

find out anything you should know Ill

pass it right along How many rounds do
you have

BOBBY

Nine Six in the gun three I found on
the floor I think theyve got Dads

gun and the extra ammunition Plus most
of the useful tools almost all the food -
- I think we have some bullion cubes a
can of shark fin soup hat Lynne bought in
Denver Even they wouldnt eat that

THE TWO MEN LAUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE THEN
SHAKE HANDS

( )

DOUG
If they come for the trailer Id suggest
you head up into the rocks youre
sitting ducks in this damn thing

DOUG WHISTLES TO THE BEAST THE DOG BARKS AND RACES
TOWARDS THE SCRUB THEN BACK AGAIN

BOBBY
And what if I contact the Army or Air
Force of whoever the heck it is owns this
corner of hell

DOUG
(over his shoulder)
Tell them to get us the hell out of here
what do you think

BOBBY
Thats not what I meant I mean how do I
tell them where to find us

DOUG STOPS AND SCRATCHES HIS HEAD

DOUG
Burn a tire

BOBBY
What

DOUG

(half joking)
Set the spare tire on fire Itll make a
lot of black smoke They should be able
to see it from a plane or copter And
tell them about the blue line on the map

BOBBY
The map aint the territory

DOUG WAVES AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THAT TURNS AND WALKS AWAY
THE BEAST RUNS AHEAD OF HIM LOOPING BACK AND AROUND THEN
AHEAD AGAIN UNTIL THE TWO ARE LOST IN THE DISTANCE

THE DAY IS BARELY BEGUN YET ALREADY THE SUNS HEAT IS
UNCOMFORTABLE BOBBY FLICKS THE SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD AND
