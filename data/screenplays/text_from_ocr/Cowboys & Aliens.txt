EXT ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

burning sun FLARES LENS beating down on A MAN
Lying in the barren DESERT Out cold Handsome but HARD
Well call him THE MAN IN BLACK the color of his dirty

A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM The man STARTS AWAKE -- to finda
MONGREL DOG over him Mangy But sweet
COUGHING the man stumbles up Howd he get here And where
the hell i here And -- OWWW A GASH in his side

part of the wound oddly SEARED He winces Trying to

this painful puzzle Something GLINTS on his wrist

A STEEL BRACELET No clasp to pull it off He touches the
surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- Its HOT

And theres a BLACK STETSON on the ground The Man grabs it

shield his eyes but STOFS

A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim A WOMAN Young
beautiful SMILING

The Man stares does he KNOW this woman is this even HIS

The dog BARKS ALERT The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand
toward his hip on INSTINCT but theres no holster NO GUNS

THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE
THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES MOSE and LUKE Dusty and
tough
Wes gallops right up to our Man gives him the once over --

WES CLAIBORNE
Howdy

(NO RESPONSE)
Were riding towards Absolution You
know how far west we are
The Mans got NO IDEA what hes talking about

LUKE CLAIBORNE
Maybe hes a dummy
Wes hops off his horse right in The Mans face now --

WES CLAIBORNE
There a reason you dont wanna answer my
question friend
And now Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Mans wrist --

MOSE CLAIBORNE
Wes hes got iron on his wrist and
hes been shot

LUKE CLAIBORNE
Bet hes a chain jumper
Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Mans SURROUNDED

LUKE
If he escaped therell be a bounty
Lets bring him with us
Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his
back
scabbard COCKS both barrels The dog GROWLS --

WES CLAIBORNE
Not your lucky day Stranger -- turn
round and start walking
But The Man doesnt move The Claibornes share glances Wes
steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

WES CLAIBORNE (CONTD)
Dead or alive no difference I said

WALK OR--
THE MAN MOVES A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the
forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the guns in
MANS HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards HOLE IN HIS

As Hose draws his Enfield The Man FLIPS the rifle again --

SLAM MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
Lukes horse -- GRABBING Lukes ankle -- suddenly Lukes
his back -- BREATHLESS staring UP at the double-barrel

LUKE CLAIBORNE

-- P-please God -- d-dont --

-- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK The rifles EMPTY
Lukes RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down
knocking him out cold And ALL of this took about ten

This man is a cold-blooded KILLER But somehow he didnt
seem to KNOW that CONFUSION Drops the rifle looks down at
his hands covered in BLOOD And the BODIES in his wake

The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wess jacket It
on the breeze -- flattens against The Strangers foot He

it up BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM

TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN --

But the dog keeps following Like theyre FRIENDS now The
turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE
VALLEY below and a SPECK within it that is

EXT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
A CROOKED SIGN ABSOLUTION The town is dismal and
Crumbling buildings blistered by sun The Man rides in --

dehydrated the wound DRAINING him
His eyes fall on the first building he sees A CHURCH

INT CHURCH - DAY

BAM The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER The Man
looks at the dog and says --

THE MAN IN BLACK

The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- hes
moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the

then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
Meet MEACHAM town preacher a tough wash-foot Baptist

MEACHAM
Odd wound Looks cauterized

The Man just stares News to him And now as Meacham leans
over the wound the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
twitch lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards

strange BRACELET on the Mans wrist Meacham reacts --

MEACHAM (CONTD)
Nice trick That some kinds magnet
The Man looks at him -- What the hell is a magnet
Meacham shrugs it off readies the needle --

MEACHAM (CONTD)
Tryn hold still
He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
slightly but bears the pain

MEACHAM (CONTD)
Whered you ride in from

THE MAN IN BLACK

THE MAN IN BLACK
Three men rode up Drew on me

(STILL CONFUSED)
My hands moved on their own

MEACHAM (CONTD)

INT RIVERBOAT - COMMODORES QUARTERS - NIGHT

RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof splashing

the

floor Ella enters glances back toward the door to make
sure

shes alone then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a
stool

Upper body NAKED in the moonlight We catch only a FLASH of

this and for a moment its PURE HOTNESS

until she turns and something ELSE is revealed criss-

crossed LASH MARKS on her back

She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water
erasing

the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face then A
MATCH

ignites behind her She WHIRLS startled covering her
breasts

with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the
Commodores
desk casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth

JAKE
You missed a spot

ELLA
The hell-re- you doing here

JAKE
Mindin my own business
(snaps out the match)
Then you decided to take a shower

ELLA
Why didnt you say anything
JAKE
Givin you privacy
She throws her shirt on but her skins wet and the shirt

glues

to her celebrating her shape in a way that cant be
ignored

Jake tosses her his jacket As she slips it on she notices
a

bottle of WHISKEY on the table and the PHOTOGRAPH OF
ALICE

ELLA

shes pretty
(Jake says NOTHING)
Who was she
Jakes quiet DARK Intense emotion intensely suppressed

JAKE
only thing I knows her name was Alice

(THEN DISTANT)
And shes dead
Ella looks up at him INTO him --

ELLA
Maybe you loved her
Jake shakes his head sort of mumblechuckles in RESISTANCE

JAKE
All you women are the same -- Always
wanna make it about Goddamn love

ELLA
(A BEAT)
Trust me Lonergan Im not the same
There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he

connects with But remains true to character ALOOF

JAKE
Dont matter
She takes a step closer Soft Intimate
his

and

ELLA
So what dj matter
Jake just looks at her Then lifts the cheroot to his lips
the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light

JAKE
What matters is I find the thing that
killed her
(dark as hell)
And make it pay
And now he leans forward with a focused LOOK holds up

BRACELET

JAKE (CONTD)
Whered you see this before
A beat Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie
But he cuts her off --

JAKE (CONTD)
-- and dont lie to me You wouldntve
asked me if you didnt recognize it
Ella tightens PAIN in her eyes And Jake REALIZES

JAKE (CONTD)
Those things they the ones who put
those marks on your back
She swallows a mixture of SHAME that hes found her out

ANGER at what was done to her

ELLA
They took my people Destroyed where Im
from
JAKE
Wheres that
ELLA

North of here Been trackin em ever
since town to town Best I figure

Jake CONSIDERS all this Softens a little

JAKE
Maybe if youd told me the truth instead
of throwin rocks at me --

ELLA

Bullshit I couldntve turned you away
from what you had to do any more than I
couldve stopped these people from going
after their kin

Truth aint worth a damn Jake and

were gonna need all the guns we can get

Their look HOLDS until Jake SMIRKS Likes her style

SHERIFF TAGGART
Whats this

DOLARHYDE
Claims to the land 50 miles west of here
Ive signed it over to the township of
Absolution

(off Taggarts LOOK)

Considering Im a businessman I figure
expansions in both our interests Needs
the Sheriffs signature to be official

SHERIFF TAGGART
Fifty miles west of here is where the
goldmine is Woodrow

DOLARHYDE

With surprise Taggart studies the paper SMILES

SHERIFF TAGGART
Whats this about twenty percent going to

Dolarhyde glances at Colorado A moment But the hardened
rancher maintains his rock-solid facade

DOLARHYDE
Figure the only way not to piss em off
is to buy ‘em

SHERIFF TAGGART
Since whend you worry about pissin
anyone off

DOLARHYDE
Just sign it Goddamnit
With a grin Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around
and
flattens the paper on his BACK using it as a surface to
SIGN
