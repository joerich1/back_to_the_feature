INDUSTRY ENTERTAINMENT

EXT WES T SIDE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

o A blac k dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway head
between his paws curled up next to the barricad e that
separates the north and southbound lanes

Traffic rumbles past him yellow cabs blu e polic e cruisers
white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates
We hea r the squeal of brakes A black 65 Ford Mustang min t
condition pulls onto the shoulder ten yard s past the dog
and back s up Th e dog raises its head

Two me n step out of the car The driver MONT Y BROGAN mid -
twenties is pale-skinned in the flickering light A small

silver crucifix hangs from a silver chain around his neck

his fingers are adorned with silver rings

The passenger KOSTYA NOVOTNY a hulking ma n in his late
thirties blow s his nose in his handkerchief

Its a cold night Monty wears a camels hai r overcoat

Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat

MONTY

Hes alive

KOSTYA

(Ukrainian accent)
This dog how do you call it

MONTY

Pit bull Must have lost somebody some

money

The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog
KOSTYA

What do w e do Monty we watch hi m rot

wel sea we D- ree MONTY tee tt

“9
I was thinking of shooting him

KOSTYA

Shooting him Ar e you sick in the head

The dog continues to stare at them impassively his face lit
by the passing headlights The pavement by hi s paws is
littered with broken glass twisted scraps of metal black
rubber from blow n tires

ce)

MONTY

They just left him here to die They
threw him out the window and kept
driving
A ships horn sounds from the Hudson

KOSTYA

Come my friend it is cold Come people
wait for us

MONTY

Theyre used to waiting

Monty squats near the dog and inspects him From this angle
it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused One ear
has been chewed to mince his hide is scored with cigarette
burns flies crawl in his bloodied fur

MONTY (CONTD)

I think maybe his hip --

The dog pounces jaws snapping lunging for Montys face
Monty stumbles backwards The dog too badly injured to
continue the attack remains in his crouch growling
Monty sits on the pavement shaking his head

MONTY (CONTD)
Christ

(beat)

Hes got some bite left

KOSTYA

I think he does not want to play with
you Come you want police to pull over
You want police looking through your car

MONTY

Look what they did to him Used him for a

fucking ashtray

Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants

MONTY (CONTD)

Lets get him in the trunk
KOSTYA

What

MONTY

Theres a vet emergency room on the East
Side I like this guy

KOSTYA

You like him He tries to bite your face

off Look at him he is meat You want

some dog I buy younice puppy tomorrow

Monty is not listening He walks back to his car opens the
trunk pulls out a soiled green army blanket

Kostya holds up his hands stop

KOSTYA (CONTD)
Wait one minute please Please stop one

minute I do not go near pit bull Monty

I do not go near pit bull

Monty carrying the army blanket walks back toward the dog

MONTY

This is a good dog I can see it in his
eyes Hes a tough little bastard

KOSTYA

Sometimes I think you are very stupid

man

The dog has slumped back to the pavement His breath comes in
shorts rasps and wheezes But he never takes his eyes off the

two men

MONTY

We wait much longer hell be dead

KOSTYA

One minute ago you want to shoot him

MONTY

That was a mercy thing But hes not
ready to go yet

KOSTYA

Yes He told you this

Monty slowly circles behind the dog holding the blanket the
way a matador wields his cape

MONTY

Distrac t him

U

( )

Kostya stares at his friend in disbelief He looks down A
crumpled soda can lies by his feet He kicks the can

The dogs head pivots to follow the aluminum flash
Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward
wrapping his arms around the dogs midsection The dog
growls bites the wool tries to break the blankets neck
Monty lurches toward the Mustang struggling to retain his
bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp As they
stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and
snaps at Montys throat

Monty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid He
returns to the drivers seat

Kostya watches him in silence stares at the sky for a few
seconds finally gets back in the car The dog thrashes in
the trunk

INT MUSTANG

Both men sit in silence as Monty revs the engine Blood is
beginning to leak from a bite on the right side of Montys
neck

KOSTYA

What goes on in your little head
Monty grins He has no idea that hes bleeding

MONTY
I got him didnt I Surprised you how

-- quick I was huh
Monty checks for traffic and pulls back onto the highway
KOSTYA

Yes you are so quick

He points at the wound on Montys neck which has begun to
flow faster

KOSTYA (CONTD)

Meanwhile you are bleeding

MONTY

Thats the dogs blood

KOSTYA

Oh Because you have hole in your neck

o DOYLE (for the nameless pit bull has become Doyle) growls
Monty tugs on his leash and Doyle grunts and quiets down

YOUNG MAN 1

What up Monty

Monty nods but doesnt say anything Hes studying the view
He stares at the green river the steel bridges the red
tugboats the stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island

Doyle barks and Monty turns SIMON a bone-thin ma n in his
early thirties approaches them He wears rubber boots that
rise to his knees and a dirty yellow down parka
SIMON

Easy Doyle easy buddy Whats up

Monty turns back to the river Doyle barks again

SIMON (CONTD)

You want to tell the dog to relax Hey
there Doyle Good dog

0)4 Doyle has extended the leash as far as Monty will allow He
7 sniffs suspiciously at Simon

SIMON (CONTD)

He reaches into his pocket and brings out a wad of five
dollar bills held together by a rubber band

MONTY

(angry)

AV- 4 Doyle snarls Simon repockets the money

SIMON

Okay okay Im just saying Im not
looking for a mercy pop

MONTY

Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat

SIMON

Cut myself shaving this morning -- four

times Cant keep my hands steady Come

Harlem Look at me--- theyll eat me alive

up there

Monty finally stands and walks toward the man closer and
closer until their faces are inches apart

MONTY

You need to leave me alone friend I

told you Im out of business

Doyle sniffs Simons boots then raises his head snout
climbing the mans leg Simon dances a half-step trying to
keep away from the pit bull without provoking him

SIMON

You worried about me narking you out You
know who I am

MONTY

Youre not listening to me I got

touched Game over

Simon blinks tries to JLaugh looks behind himlooks down at
Doyle rubs his nose with the back of his hand

SIMON

Five years Ive been coming to you All

right all right Im leaving Theres no

need to be nasty

Monty and Doyle watch the man go they begin walking in the
opposite direction They pass the concrete chessboards the
sandboxes and pause for a moment by a basketball court
Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before
school Monty shakes his head disdainfully watching one
player dribble at the top of the key

MONTY

You got no left

The player drives right and misses an open lay-up Monty
spits and continues walking Doyle leading the way

EXTCAMPBELL-SAW YER HIGH SCHOOL -- LATER

Monty looks up at the old private school tucked away on a

leafy street on the Upper East Side

Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by People
are always looking at Monty

Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before

crushing them out and entering the school

INT CAMPBELL-SAW YER HIGH SCHOOL

Monty walks down a corridor of the school building Doyle
padding along beside him STUDENTS hurrying to their
classes stare at the dog and then at Monty

The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty
Monty stops before a row of framed photographs He examines
one photograph and smiles

INSERT PHOTOGRAPH

The Campbell-Sawyer basketball team The players stand in a
semi-circle with their coaches We move in closer on one face
in particular Monty when he was sixteen free and easy

We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to
blur

ADMINISTRATOR (OS)

gyee eens Excuse-me-- sir can I help you

Monty lost in a reverie looks up The ADMINISTRATOR a
tall harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties squints at

him through her glasses

MONTY

What

ADMINISTRATOR

Can I help you with something

MONTY

(smiling)
No I dont think so

ADMINISTRATOR

There are no dogs allowed on school
grounds

f MONTY -“

(pointing at the picture)

ADMINISTRATOR

dog

MONTY

(still looking at picture)

The administrator bends forward and squints at the photo

ADMINISTRATOR
I guess you werent the center
MONTY

Ha ha Starting point guard Started on
varsity from my first game freshman
year I still hold the all-time assist
record

ADMINISTRATOR
Mm no Marvin Ray broke the record last “V

Monty stares at her She shrugs

ADMINISTRATOR (CONTD)

Monty turns back to the photo

MONTY

ADMINISTRATOR

MONTY

Until I got kicked off the team After
that they fell apart Do you know where
Jakob Elinsky is

ADMINISTRATOR

MONTY

0 He leads Doyle away but stops after a few feet and turns
back

MONTY (CONTD)
Marvin Ray
ADMINISTRATOR

Mm hm

MONTY
Youre sure
ADMINISTRATOR

I was there when he broke the record
Monty nods and continues on his way The administrator
watches man and dog walk down the long corridor

INT CAMPBELL-SAW YER CLASSROOM

JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard facing three rows of
uninspired teenage faces He wears a tweed jacket that seems

a few sizes too large with chalk stains on the sleeves

Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger There is
something adolescent in his slouch in the way he chews his

lip

One of his students MARY DANNUNZIO stands at her
desk reading from a poetry textbook Her eyes drown in pools
of painted shadow her hair is dyed black tattooed roses

garland her wrist

MARY

-«-------111 (reading) - --
Let us roll all our strength and all

Our sweetness up into one ball

And tear pur pleasures with rough strife

Through the iron gates of life

Jakob watches her We dont know the Campbell-Sawyer dress
code but we can guess that shes violating it We can also
guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly

Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt

MARY (CONTD)
(reading)
Thus though we cannot make our sun

Stand still yet we will make him run
Mary shrugs and sits down

JAKOB
Good good excellent reading Urn okay

so What do people think Whats going on
here

Nobody says anything Jakob nods
JAKOB (CONTD)

Okay

LUKE a sullen-looking student with a shaved head and a
failed goatee raises his hand

JAKOB (CONTD)

Luke

LUKE

JAKOB

No You went twenty minutes ago
LUKE

I have a bladder infection

JAKOB

The poem The poem folks Hello
MARY

Its not real deep or anything The guy
wants to get laid and hes telling her to

give itup
A few of the students titter half-heartedly

A knock on the door releases Jakob from his hell He goes to
answer it and then stops startled

Its the type ofdoo r popular in school buildings with a
wire-reinforced glass panel at head height allowing you to
look into the classroom without disturbing anyone

Doyle tongue dangling from his mouth stares back at Jakob
through the panel

MARY (CONTD)

I didnt know your mother was coming
today Luke

LUKE

Eat me

Jakob opens the door Mont y stands there holding up Doyle Doyle scramble s out of
his arms and jumps on Jakob nearly knocking th e teache r
down getting his dirty paw s all over Jakobs jacket

MONT Y

Easy Doyle
Doyle immediately calms down squatting by Jakob s feet and
staring up at the teacher

JAKOB

Hey -- uh whats going on
Jakob seems awkward around Monty nervous

MONT Y

(looking at Doyle)
Look at him He loves you
Jakob looks at Doyle wh 0 wag s the stump of his tail

MONT Y (CONTD)

He really love s you So what are you

Jakob turns to look at his class who all stare at Mont y and
the dog For the first time today theyre quiet

JAKOB

MONT Y

back to Monty wh o is smiling at Mary Jako b grab s the door
knob

JAKOB

Monty nods

MONTY
Tel Frank well meet up after midnight
He leads Doyle away and Jakob closes the door the n turns to

look at his silent class The bell rings and all the students
grab their bags

INT TEACHERS LOUNG E -- LATER

Jakob alon e in the room sits on a sofa his hea d in his
hands He looks up when he hears a knock on the door xly
Mary DAnnunzio peek s in

MARY

Jakob sits up straighter and smiles

JAKOB

JAKOB (CONTD)

MARY

I want to know why I got a B on my
story

JAKOB

JAKOB

MARY

Vince Miskella writes a story about his
grandmother dying and you give him an A
What is that a charity A Everyones

dying You know why Not because its so
traumatic Because its a guaranteed A
And youre all sentimental like Oh
Vince that was very powerful very
moving No it wasnt You didnt care I

grandmothers do they die Mary has worked herself into a lather and Jakob watches her
admiringly

JAKOB

What did your mother say when you go t
that

Mary stares at him not comprehending
MARY

JAKOB

(pointing at her wrist)
The tattoo

MARY

She said Whered you get the mone y for
that

JAKOB
Oh And
MARY

And what did I say or where did I get the
money

JAKOB

Well what did you say I guess
MARY

JAKOB

Oh Did he

MARY

No Why do you care so much

JAKOB
Just curious

MARY

So youre not going to change the grade

JAKOB

No Im not changing the grade Id be

happy to discuss --

Mary yanks her bookbag off the floor and straps it on her
shoulder

ITI 16

MARY
Great That was a big waste of time
JAKOB

Look instead of worrying about the grade
so much lets talk about the actual---

MARY

(muttering)

Forget it

She stomps out of the lounge her black combat boots clomping
on the corridors linoleum floor

Jakob shakes his head and looks up at the clock 915 He
reaches for the phone sitting on the coffee table

INT SHREVE ZIMMER INVESTMENT BANK -- SAME TIME

FRANK SLATTERY also in his mid-twenties stares at the row
of clocks on the far wall Below each clock is a sign Tokyo
Hong Kong Frankfurt London The clock marked New York reads

915

The trading floor is one giant room rows of TRADERS seated
before their computers jabbering into their telephone
headsets No women -- the place is loud and aggressive
Slattery is built like a former college wrestler thick-

necked broken-nosed muscular his hair retreating from his
forehead his eyes undercast with dark crescents

One of his phones rings He answers

----SEATTER Y - -- -

Frank Slattery
He listens for one second

SLATTERY (CONTD)

Cant talk right now Employment numbers
coming out

INT TEACHERS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
JAKOB

All right Just wanted to let you know
that Monty --

INT SHREVE ZIMMER - CONTINUOUS

SLATTERY

Ill call you later

-A--

He hangs up the phone and returns his gaze to the computer
screens in front of him Clearly hes waiting for something
and clearly hes anxious

LICHTER (OSS)
Coming out with us later on

Slattery looks up at his boss ARI LICHTER early forties a
plump genial man
SLATTERY
Nah Im meeting some friends tonight
LICHTER

Big date
The subject clearly makes Slattery uncomfortable

SLATTERY
More of a going-away party
LICHTER

Listen the other thing youre still
holding onto all those contracts

SLATTERY
Why youre nervous
LICHTER

I dont like it The claims numbers have
dropped three weeks straight

SLATTERY

And everybodys thinking if claims have
dropped employment must be up

LICHTER

Everybodys thinking that because its
pretty much always true

SLATTERY
Not this time
LICHTER
Frank--

SLATTERY
Ive got a theory
LICHTER

Oh good youve got a theory Look
youre in awfully deep Youve got sixty
million of the banks money in there-- e SLATTERY
A hundred million

The news startles Lichter

LICHTER

A hundred million Jesus Frank
SLATTERY

They authorized me to a hundred million

Other traders sitting nearby have begun watching this
exchange and Lichter is careful to keep his voice down

LICHTER

A week ago They raised your limit a week
ago and youre already maxing out

SLATTERY

Im telling you were in for a low
number One-forty maybe one-thirty-five

LICHTER

Cut your stake in half all right Youve

been doing a great job everyone knows

that but Im still you r boss and Im

telling you sell those contracts

Lichter grips Slatterys shoulder for a moment and then walks
toward his office (a real office with walls and a door)
exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor

PHELAN fresh from college walks down the row handing fax
sheets to all the traders He hands a sheet to Slattery wh o
looks-at--it briefly before crumpling it

PHELAN

Sollies looking for a high number Tw o
hundred and eighty thousands their call
SLATTERY

Fuck Sollie

PHELAN

Fuck Salomon Brothers

SLATTERY

Theyre hedging their bets They want
everyone on their side of the fence

PHELAN

Whats the big deal with the employment
number anyway Slattery doesnt want to discuss this right now
SLATTERY

More jobs means fewer people looking for
work right Which means its harder to
find the right people for a job which
means you got to raise wages to get them
which mean s inflation goes up -- you
following

PHELAN

(not following)
Yeah

Slatter y frowns

SLATTERY

Youre wearing a striped shirt with a
striped tie
Phelan looks down at his tie

PHELAN

Yeah Is that bad

SLATTERY x

sLbi You look like a xuoAiiiig optical -LJ JHJOJ LIL
xxiv c a fuckin j u“tJAax illusion

Go away

Phelan walks away nervously adjusting his tie

MARCUSE peeks over the partition in front of Slattery With
his slicked-back hair red suspenders and obnoxious smirk
Marcuse looks like a ma n who owns the Gordon Gekk 0 action
figure

- MARGUESE- ---

Better hop to sonny boy
Slattery says nothing just stabs angrily at hi s keyboard

MARCUSE (CONTD)

I dont see you pickin g up the phone

Didnt Lichter just tell you to sell

Sounds like your allowance got cut off

Slattery nostrils flared pretends to ignore the taunts

MARCUSE (CONTD)

Youre not going to disobey a direct

order are you

-- 20 Slattery rolls back in his wheeled office chair and stares at
Marcuse

SLATTERY

I dont come into your bedroom and tell
yo u how to fuck your wife do I

Marcuse grins He calls to another trader down the floor

MARCUSE

Hey Schultz what are we looking at for
the employment number

SCHULTZ

(yelling from his desk)

Two-fifty two-seventy somewhere in

there

Marcuse sits down again disappearing behind the partition
Slattery glowers at his desk He picks up his phon e and holds
the receiver to his ear never dialing a number

Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door

LICHTER

Slattery Were good

Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up As soon as Lichter
returns to his office Slattery hangs up the phone
Marcuse sticks his head above the partition again

MARCUSE

Good thing you got rid of those
contracts-Looks like a huge numbe r 0 n -- «-------««»
the way

The trading floor suddenly -- and eerily- goes quiet
Everyones attention is fixed on the television monitors
hanging from th e ceilings The monitors ar e muted closed
captioning files along the bottoms of the screens

Each monitor is tuned to the same station a financial
network broadcasting the employment numbers release A
REPORTER wearing a bowtie reads the statistics

Slattery bows his head He holds his hands in his lap and
closes his eyes For a long while the room is very quiet

Then a commotion of shouts and groans riles the floor
Everyone is hollering at the same time and we can only make
out a few phrases

TRADER 1 (OS)
Stop out of that Stop out
TRADER 2 (OS)

Were going for a ride

Slattery looks up at the nearest monitor A white number is
emblazoned on a blue background 138112 Every monitor in
the room flashes the same number

Slattery stares at his computer screen There it is again
displayed prominently in the largest window 138 112
Slattery raises his eyebrows He juggles the crumpled fax
sheet a few times and then tosses it over the partition

where Marcuse is sitting

MARCUSE (OS)

Fuck you Slattery
Slattery grins and leans back in his chair hands behind his
head

EXTMONTYS BUILDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville
NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps reading a book
Naturelle in her early twenties has the lean body of a

runner Its cold outside but she doesnt seem to mind When

she sees Monty coming she closes the book and stands

NATURELLE

How long have you guys been walking I

woke up at seven and you were already

gone

Monty digging in his pocket for his keys kisses her for an
answer Naturelle closes her eyes and tries to embrace him
but Monty abruptly ends the kiss and climbs the stairs
Doyle wags the stump of his tail

NATURELLE (CONTD)

How you doing Mr Doyle
She bends down to scratch him behind his mangled ear
MONTY

Why you waiting down here

NATURELLE

I had my book It was a beautiful day

c Monty smiles
MONTY

Of course it was a beautiful day
He holds the door open for her and Doyle

INT MONTYS APARTMENT

Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle
then locks it There are five locks and a heavy steel

deadbolt

Despite the ominous security its a nice one-bedroom
apartment with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the
brownstones across the street

Black-and-white photographs line the walls shots of the
Manhattan skyline of Bensonhurst of Doyle The largest
photo hanging above the sofa is of Brogans Bar

Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep
Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the
remote

WEATHERMAN

The first major storm of winter is

heading our way --

Monty turns off the television He stares at the dead screen
Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey

and a spoon

She hands the jar to Monty who opens it for her She sits

beside him and begins eating the honey watching him He sees
her watching

MONTY
What
NATURELLE

What are you thinking about

MONTY

What am I thinking about

He leans forward and unclips a hand-tooled leather holster
from the back of his belt A B for Brogan is tooled into
the leather stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers logo
A AO caliber automatic squat and black rests in the
holster Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and
runs his fingers over the B Naturelle stares at the gun

MONTY (CONTD)

Im thinking I want to be like that girl

from the X-Men the one who can walk

through walls

Hes still tracing the holsters B with his fingertips

MONTY (CONTD)

And if I cant do that if I cant figure

out how to walk through walls Im
thinking one shot through the roof of the
mouth boom problem solved

Naturelle hits him on the shoulder
NATURELLE

Dont joke about that

MONTY

You think Im joking

NATURELLE

So what are we doing tonight Before you
shoot yourself

Monty reclines arms spread wide and resting on the sofas
back cushions

MONTY

Uncle Blues throwing me a party at
Velvet

NATURELLE
I thought it was over with him
MONTY -- - --

Almost
He watches her eat another spoonful of raw honey

MONTY (CONTD)

Thats a nasty habit you have
She leans forward and kisses him on the lips

NATURELLE

Come take a bath with me

MONTY

Not right now

She caresses his jaw but Monty is distant his mind J

elsewhere 4--4

o She sets the honey jar on the table and walks out of the
living room Monty listens to her in the bathroom drawing
the bathwater

He listens to the sound of running water

CUT TO

INT MONTYS BATHROOM -- SIX MONTHS AGO
Naturelle sits on Montys lap in the narrow bathtub Hes
massaging her shoulders Music plays from a radio on the
windowsill

She is laughing at something he just said He leans closer
and kisses the back of her neck behind her ears She
stretches back lifting one leg out of the bath

He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops looking at
the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle She follows his
gaze to the tattoo and then groans

NATURELLE
Not this again
MONTY

You were born in America you lived in
America your whole life youve been to
Puerto Rico twice for vacation What is
that I should get an Irish flag tattooed

on my ass cause my grandparents are from
there

NATURELLE

Youdont have room on your ass for an

Trish flag

Monty dips his hands into the warm water reaches below her
grabs her butt Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs

MONTY

Between you and me the kids will be just

right

Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them They stare
at each other Doyle barks from the other room

Naturelle gets out of the tub pulls on a bathrobe and goes

to answer the door Monty waits listening He knows who it
is He stares out the bathrooms open window

C) INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM -- STILL IN FLASHBACK

Monty wearing sweatpants and no shirt walks into the living
room Four DEA AGENTS all wearing DEA windbreakers and
shoulder holsters wait for him

Doyle ears back growls at the agents Monty scratches

Doyles head and the dog relaxes a bit

Naturelle panicked stares at Monty Shes still holding the
apartment door open

MONTY

Close the door baby
She closes the door

AGENT BRZOWSKI
Montgomery Brogan
MONTY

Yeah
Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty who
looks it over

AGENT BRZOWSKI 44

Im Agent Brzowksi with the Drug

Enforcement Agency Weve got a warrant

to search your apartment

Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down The other
three agents stroll around the apartment One looks out the
window one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee
table one stares at a photograph on the wall

AGENT CUNNINGHAM
You take this picture

MONTY

Yeah

AGENT CUNNINGHAM

Nice picture

When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle the dog
growls and the agent jumps back

MONTY

Easy Doyle

Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him Monty
crouches one hand stroking Doyles thick neck

Naturelle uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe begins
heading back to the bedroom

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

Ms Rosario Thats your name right I

He winks at her
AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

Naturelle leans against the wall looking for a sign from
Monty who gives her none

The agents dont seem to be searching very hard

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

Hm
He stares down at the sofa hes sitting on

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT-D)
This sofa is not very comfortable

Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales He
turns and looks carefully at Naturelle
AGENT CUNNINGHAM

important

AGENT BRZOWSKI

uncomfortable Its lumpy

MONTY

Brzowksi stands and looks down at the cushion Monty is still
staring at Naturelle who meets his eye for a second and then
quickly turns away

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)
Maybe its the padding
AGENT CUNNINGHAM

Could be the padding
Brzowski picks up the center cushion turns it in his hands
and unzips it

AGENT BRZOWSKI

Probably the padding
He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them
drift to the floor Monty and Naturelle watch

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

more comfortable to sit on

The other agents laugh Brzowski pulls out a package the size
of a bottle of wine from the cushion a bundle of plastic

wrap and masking tape

Brzowski raises his eyebrows in mock shock while the other
agents poh and cluck -- -- --- - -- ---

AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONTD)

END FLASHBACK
INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM

Monty sits on the sofa running his hand over the sofa

cushion Outside its dark and Monty hasnt turned on the

lights

NATURELLE (OS)

Baby

V Monty looks up Naturelle stands in the bathrooms doorway

wearing a bathrobe

For a moment they watch each other in silence Then he
stands grabs the holster off the table and clips it to the
back of his belt

NATURELLE (CONTD)

He kisses her quickly and turns to go but then stops and
looks at her
MONTY (CONTD)

Could you wear the silver dress tonight

NATURELLE

He nods

MONTY

I want to remember you in that dress

He walks out of the apartment leaving Naturelle alone in the
dark living room

EXTMONTYS BUILDING

Kostya sits on the top step of the stoop sipping from a

silver flask A female JOGGER runs past and Kostya calls
after her

KOSTYA

Hello --teeauti-f-uA woman

She doesnt look in his direction He takes another swig from
his flask
A young MOTHER pushes a baby stroller past the stoop

KOSTYA (CONTD)

Hello beautiful mother Hello little
baby
The mother doesnt look at him but the two-year old GIRL
fascinated stares at him

KOSTYA (CONTD)
(calling after mother)
You look like Julia Roberts They tell

you this yes Come back I make you a
new baby I make you a boy

Monty opens the front door He stares down at Kostya
MONTY

What are you doing here

KOSTYA

Kostya stands and grips Montys arm

KOSTYA (CONTD)
You are okay

MONTY

KOSTYA

MONTY

KOSTYA

MONTY

Kostya shrugs again
KOSTYA

Maybe her aunt is illegal alien
MONTY

KOSTYA

Maybe the Federals threaten her
Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs

MONTY
Youre insane She wouldnt do that
KOSTYA

No Did you ask her

Monty--stares--up--at- Kostya for a few seconds before-walking --
away

Kostya stands at the top of the stoop He feels something and
raises his palms to the air The snow has begun to fall

He looks up into the sky Something catches his eye -- in one
of the fourth floor windows Naturelle is staring down at
him

Kostya watches her She lets the curtain close Kostya takes
another slug from his flask
INT SUBWAY STATION

Monty waits for the 6 train Two BOYS wearing winter
parkas and knit caps crouch near the edge of the platform
pointing down at the tracks and laughing

MONTY

Whats down there

The boys point and Monty looks We follow his gaze We cant
see anything at first but then as if our eyes were

adjusting to the dark we begin to pick out movement

A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks nosing
through balled-up paper bags candy wrappers and orange
peels
BOY 1

These ones they eat rat poison like

chocolate

The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright
wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail
Monty reaches into the pocket of his camels hair coat and
pulls out a handful of change

MONTY

Watch this

He selects a quarter and -- with a free throw motion as smooth
as Hersey Hawkinss-- tosses it into the empty cup a ten-

foot shot

The big rat startled hustles into the alcove below the lip

of the platform The boys impressed whistle

MONTY (CONTD)

Here --
He offers his palmful of change

MONTY (CONTD)

Take a shot at it
The boys look at each other for a moment before each takes a
coin They stare up at Monty He nods at them

MONTY (CONTD)

Lets see what you got

Boy takes careful aim at the coffee cup His shot is way
off target though -- it pings off the tile on the far side of
the tunnel

MONTY (CONTD)

Your release is too high Look --
He mimics the boys shooting motion A’ MONTY (CONTD)

See Youre letting go way up here so
its floating on you Its like -- you
play basketball

BOY 1

No

MONTY

Baseball

BOY 1

No

MONTY

No What do you play

BOY 1

Soccer

MONTY

(disgusted)
Soccer All right forget it

(turning to the other boy)

Your turn little man

Boy 2 toes the edge of the yellow danger line and practices
his motion When he finally releases the coin it flashes
through the air and drops neatly into the cup

MONTY (CONTD)

Thataboy
He raises his fist and the boy taps knuckles grinning

BOY 1
You see that You see that Charlie got

mad skills
Charlie says nothing just grins and hops around on one foot

MONTY

Make a wish

CHARLIE
I get a wish
MONTY

Hell yes A shot like that deserves a
wish

Monty and Charlie stare at the coffee cup and concentrate

EXTBROGANS BAR -- NIGHT

The snow is falling faster We watch the flakes spin through
a yellow cone of streetlight

We see the bar from the street The name Brogans Bar and
Grill is written in gold script on the storefront window
From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar
neon beer signs hanging in the window

It was beautiful china

Monty leans back in his chair and surveys the place No t that

thick black beard powerful hands and no tolerance for
incompetence Its hard to determine his age -- anywhere from
forty to sixty

Valghobek his lieutenant looks at first glance like an
overweight suburban dad But on closer inspection there is
something absolutely mirthless in his smile a meannes s
around his eyes Hes in his late forties

Gedny mid-thirties Uncle Blues lawyer wears a shiny suit
a gold bracelet and a deep artificial-looking tan

Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two
watch him Gedny gestures toward the windows

Julian laughs and hands Monty a sheet of graph paper covered
with geometric proofs

off the plastic wrap

JAKOB

SLATTERY

Doyle I dont know Give him to
Naturelle
Slattery balls up the plastic wrap and tosses it into the
corner They begin unrolling the rug

JAKOB

They should at least let him take his dog

with him Maybe it wouldnt be so lonely
Slattery cocks an eyebrow and stares at Jakob

SLATTERY

You cant take your dog to prison with

could

They look down at the unrolled rug

SLATTERY
That looks pretty good’
JAKOB

continues

JAKOB (CONTD)

Slattery makes a gun with his thumb and index finger and
points it at his temple Jakobs eyes go wide

JAKOB

Slattery thinks about it for a minute

SLATTERY (CONTD)
The third choice is he goes to prison
JAKOB

Monty

JAKOB

Monty laughs Doyle has walked into the kitchen and now
stands behind Monty staring up curiously at the two humans
MONTY x

with laughter Doyle a little confused licks Monty s face

NATURELLE (CONTD)

( ) Jakob angrily picks at the label of his beer bottle

JAKOB

Slattery drains his whiskey He tries to catch Jodys eye
but shes staring at someone who just walked into the bar

Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their
glasses and raise them too

MONTY

He drinks Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit

EXT VELVET -- NIGHT

Monty steps out of a taxi followed by Slattery and Jakob A
roiling MOB occupies half the block crowding in front of the
entrance to the dance club

Most are teenagers They clot together in groups of fours and
fives smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep
warm Almost none are dressed for the snow

our bones

Mary opens her mouth and speaks but we might not be able to
hear it over the music

MARY

INT VELVET VIP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room Naturelle is
already there speaking with Slattery

The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red
velvet The couches are upholstered in red velvet the small
bar in the corner is draped with red velvet the carpet is

red faux velvet

----4 DJ Dusks music pours from speakers bolted into the corners
S

His beats are impossible to sit still for incorporating
elements of bossa nova techno hip hop and jazz

Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle His
gaze tends to slide her way and his desire for her is

apparent to everyone

Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him She
looks beautiful in-the silver dress-Sh hugs him Monty
e

stands awkwardly in her embrace

When she realizes hes not returning the hug she quickly
releases him Hes watching her carefully She sees Jakob and
smiles at him

NATURELLE

Mary grins tears off her fake fur coat and hides it
underneath a sofa She wears a white tank-top with Tweety
Bird emblazoned on the front Tweety Bird looks scared

tray of champagne flutes Naturelle kisses Daphne on the

cheek and the two women exchange greetings Everyone takes a
glass

giant gulp then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of
her hand Jakob stares at her horrified

MARY

Anyone want to go dance

Naturelle glances at Monty

MONTY

Do what you want to do

Jakob and Slattery hear the coldness in Montys voice and are
surprised by it ATM ----

Mary grabs Naturelles hand and leads her out the door

INT CATWALK -- MOMENTS LATER

The three men stand on a glass-enclosed catwalk overlooking
the dance floor The place is so crowded and dark that the
dancers look like one strange beast thrashing and swaying to j
the beat

from a riser above the dance floor He stands in the eye of a
spotlight deftly flipping needles onto spinning records i

Kostya leans closer to Monty and speaks quietly
KOSTYA

Monty nods Kostya grins and slaps Montys shoulder

KOSTYA (CONTD)
She is waiting

Kostya walks down the staircase that leads from the catwalk

to the dance floor and disappears into the crowd For a while
neither Monty nor Slattery speaks -

Then Slattery looks at Monty and notices his eyes are closed

SLATTERY

You all right
Monty opens his eyes

MONTY

They knock out your teeth the first

night You know why So you can give them
head all night long and they dont have

to worry about biting

SLATTERY

wildly on a platform

MONTY (CONTD)

Our friend Jake has picked himself a

winner

INT VELVET VIP ROOM -- LATER

The room is beginning to crowd with Montys friends and
acquaintances Jakob sits alone on the sofa sipping
champagne He clearly recognizes no one

The men speak loudly holding their- champagne flutes in
ringed fists Lean women stand in clusters heads bowed
together We hear snippets of banter in four different
languages

Jakob dips his head against the sofas velvet armrest Hes
clearly exhausted He begins slipping into sleep

Mary walks into the room The men standing nearby turn to
look at her then whisper to each other and laugh Mary sees
Jakob curled up on the sofa and dances over to him

She pulls off his Yankees cap and puts it on her own head
where it sits crookedly She climbs on top of him her knees
straddling his chest and bends close to whisper in his ear

MARY

Jakey Jakey

O She runs her fingernail down his side Jakob half-sleeping
smiles and caresses her hand Then his eyes pop open He
jerks upright and Mary slides off him

JAKOB

Whoa what are you doing What are you
doing
Mary now standing and slightly swaying laughs

MARY

Dont panic Nobody here gives a shit
JAKOB

I give a shit Do you know what happens
if somebody sees me -- us -- like that

Mary sits on the far side of the sofa knees primly clasped
together exaggerating the role of good girl
MARY

Beg your pardon Mr Elinsky
JAKOB

MARY - mm

JAKOB

Jesus
He tries to rub the sleep out of his eyes

JAKOB (CONTD)

Bird stares back alarmed

MARY (CONTD)

Jakobs mouth falls open

JAKOB

Elinsky

Jakob says nothing for a moment but he cant resist
JAKOB

MARY

Huh

Mary is watching three women dancing in the middle of the
room their purses flung down on the floor between them

JAKOB

Mary turns to look at him again but its clear shes not
really following the conversation

JAKOB (CONTD)

MARY

MARY

MARY

MARY

She springs up from the sofa and takes three steps back then
begins staggering toward Jakob hands folded over her gut
covering her invisible sword wound

MARY (CONTD)

Exchange forgiveness with me noble

Hamlet Min e and my fathers death come

not upon thee nor thine on me

She collapses onto the red sofa and lies there quivering for
a moment before going still

A group of men smoking cigars in the corner claps loudly
Jakob stares down at the prone Mary He cannot hel p noticing
the stretch of pale skin between the dark denim of her
waistband and the white cotton of her tank top

Mary sits up and brushes some stray hairs under the Yankees

cap
MARY (CONTD)
Its bettex with the fake blood j

JAKOB
No it was very good

MARY
Ms Taylor says Im the best dier shes

was afraid of heights

JAKOB

Are you allowed to stay out this late On
a school night

MARY

You think my mother gives a shit Anyway

snow day for sure

JAKOB

I need to go to sleep

Mary lies back on the sofa and kicks her feet in the air She
begins a bicycling motion her hands behind her head

MARY

Cant sleep yet Hes turning it on

Jakob looks at her slender pale ankles He covers his eyes
Mary rolls off the sofa

MARY (CONTD)

Is there a bathroom in here
Jakob points

JAKOB

Over there I think

Mary winks at him and makes her way across the room En route
she grabs a champagne flute off Daphnes platter and chugs

it She replaces the glass and slips into the bathroom

Jakob watches her go He watches the bathroom door close
behind her He stands a bit unsteadily Hes been drinking

all night He weaves his way to the bathroom door

He waits Eventually Mary opens the door She looks up at
Jakob he r eyes as wide as Tweety Birds
MARY
You need to pee
JAKOB

No

He presses forward backing her up and closes the door
behind him

INT VI P BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The bathroom is blue-walled and lit by a single blue bulb

MARY

Hi

shoulder s and kisses her hard on the mouth His hand s begin
t o mov e down from her shoulders --

--an d then abruptly Jakob pulls back He stares a t Mary
wh o stares at the floor She looks stunned the Yankees cap
sitting crookedly on her head

Jakob stumbles backward He tries to say something bu t cant
get the words out

He turns and rams through the bathroom door

INT VELVE T VI P ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

He shoves past cigar smokers and dancing women He runs from
the VI P room

The partiers watch him go and then turn to look at the

bathroom a drop of blue in the overwhelming redness of the

VIP room

Mar y stands in the blue light still looking at the floor

INT WHITE ROOM -- LATER

The Whit e Room got its name for obvious reasons Everythin g
is white the shag carpet the walls the overstuffed

furniture

Monty sits on a large whit e bea n bag in a corner of the room
He holds a champagne bottle in one hand and takes occasional
sips

MARGUERITE a beautiful prostitute in her early twenties
kneels in front of Monfcyherbands on hisJfchighs

Monty passes her the bottle and she takes a long draught
never taking her eyes of f him She hands back th e bottl e and
unzips his fly taking he r time wit h everything

Monty leans back and closes his eyes We watch hi m like this
for a few seconds and then we

CUT TO
EXT CARL SCHURZ PARK PLAYGROUND -- AFTERNOON

Springtime Monty sits on a park bench This is several years
ago and he looks younger less exhausted

86

He is watching two high school girls on the swings One
blonde -- LINDSAY JAMISON -- and one brunette -- a younger
Naturelle

Both girls wear the uniform of their private school white
blouses embroidered with the schools initials and green

plaid skirts over black tights

Both girls are smoking But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette
clenched in one hand as she swings higher Naturelle
continues taking reckless drags the crook of her elbow
holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward

Monty stands and approaches the swings The girls pretend not
to notice him
MONTY

Hey
The girls keep swinging

MONTY (CONTD)
Could I bum a smoke
NATURELLE
What

MONTY

A smoke

NATURELLE

This is my last one
Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty

LINDSAY

Monty nods slowly Its obvious he doesnt recognize her but
he doesnt want to be rude

MONTY

Yeah you look familiar

Naturelle has stopped swinging now Lindsay jumps off he r
swing

LINDSAY

I know wh 0 you are Come on Nat weve
got practice

MONTY

Lindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away
looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following
Naturelle is not following

MONTY (CONTD)

MONTY

He smiles and sits on the swing next to her He tries
swinging a little

MONTY

I never really got the hang of these
things

-- NATURELLE - -- --
Its all in the legs
She starts swinging again and he watches her her long black
hair falling beneath her her legs straight and then bent
straight and then bent

CUT TO

INT WHITE ROOM

Montys eyes are still closed Now he opens them His hands
are in Marguerites hair but now they drop by his side
Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders She backs away

from him looking up at his face for a moment before blinking
and licking her lips

MONTY

Its my fault Youre very beautiful
He hands her the bottle again and she takes a long sip

MARGUERITE

(Colombian accent)
You are very handsome Are you an actor

Monty zips his fly
MONTY

Yeah Ima star

INT CLUB ROOM -- LATER

The club room is decorated to look like the library of an
English country manor dark wood paneling bookshelves
stacked with leather-bound books flickering sconce lights
Slattery sits on a stool at the bar rolling a glass of

whiskey between his palms His eyes are red from crying or
exhaustion or both

Naturelle walks into the room and spots Slattery She goes
over to him and squeezes the back of his neck before sitting
on the neighboring stool He sits up straight and smiles
NATURELLE

Why are you all alone

SLATTERY

I couldnt sit in that goddamn red room

anymore I dont know anyone in there

These are Montys friends--

NATURELLE

I guess so Theyre around a lot anywayv

Slattery drains his whiskey He signals for another and the
bartender pours it Hes clearly getting drunk though
Slattery is a man who can handle his liquor He checks his
watch

SLATTERY

Im supposed to be at work in a couple

hours Christ I cant even imagine

working today You just gave me the flu
okay Im calling in sick

NATURELLE

I wish Monty could call in sick Have you
seen him around

SLATTERY

Hes probably saying goodbye to everyone

NATURELLE

Can you do me a favor

SLATTERY

Slattery catches himself looking at Naturelles cleavage and
looks away

NATURELLE

Keep an eye on Monty tonight would you
Try to stick with him

SLATTERY

Slattery nods For a while they are quiet
NATURELLE (CONTD)

SLATTERY

Thats not true Hes just --

NATURELLE

days Its like he doesnt trust me

SLATTERY

Why wouldnt he trust you
Naturelle is quiet for a moment

---- -90

NATURELLE

She stands and smooths out the wrinkles in her silver dress
Again Slattery has to turn away from the sight of her

SLATTERY

Hes got so much going on hes so smart
and what does he do He throws it al
away An d here I am his friend -- I mean

Slattery watches her walk away A moment later Jakob hurries
in sweating and frantic

JAKOB

JAKOB

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY -- LATER
Monty and Kostya walk slowly down the corridor that leads to
the managers office

1 92

0-4 They stop outside the office and knock on the steel-plated
door MUSTAFAYEYV a balding man smoking a cigarette opens
the door and closes it behind him He nods

Monty and Kostya pull out their guns and hand them to him
Checking the safeties he shoves the guns under his belt and
cigarette clenched between his teeth carefully pats both men
down

When Mustafayev finishes searching them he raps on the door
and it opens again He gestures and Monty and Kostya enter

INT VELVET MANAGERS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Mustafayev follows them inside hands their guns to one of
the ZAKHAROV twins and goes back outside closing the door
The twins are Russian redheads who speak very little English
Their faces are blunted and pitiless

Uncle Blue sits behind Volandes desk reading the paper
Valghobek sits on a corner of the desk

The twin with the guns places them carefully in front of
Uncle Blue then returns to stand by his brother both of
them standing behind Monty and Kostya

DJ Dusks music can barely be heard down here the thump of
bass and drum sounding like distant bombshells

Uncle Blue folds his paper neatly and sets it aside

UNCLE BLUE

Montgomery How is the party
MONTY

Its all right Thanks for setting it up
UNCLE BLUE

The first time I went to prison I was
fourteen years old a skinny little boy
Very afraid By the time I came out I had
my beard I was a grown man I went back
to my hometown I found my mother I
kissed her And she screamed

(smiling)

She did not recognize me I have been in
three different prisons Montgomery in
three different countries You know what
I learned

Monty shakes his head and waits

o UNCLE BLUE (COM D)

I learned that prison is not a good place
to be

KOSTYA

(laughing)
I knew that before I went

VALGHOBEK

Nobodys talking to you Keep your mouth
shut

UNCLE BLUE
Seven years is a long time Some men
would do anything to avoid seven years in
prison

Monty waits

VALGHOBEK

Your fathers a hardworking man Wheres

6th Avenue am I right

MONTY
Yes
VALGHOBEK

At least he has a short commute He can
practically walk to work Where does he
live 17th Avenue And what was the cross-
street 81st 8002 17th Avenue Is that
right The first floor That must be

noisy living on the first floor But he
doesnt walk to work does he He drives

-A 1987 Honda Should-I tell you how many
miles he has on the car

Monty stares at the floor

UNCLE BLUE

Your father I like your father A hard-
working man He has had bad luck some
very bad luck Everyone in the
neighborhood loved your mother You
remember her Senka

VALGHOBEK

Sure She was a beautiful woman A real
sweetheart

94

UNCLE BLUE

I want to help your father I could use a
man like that a hard-working man a man

father Do you understand what I mean
Montgomery

MONTY

him into it

i

UNCLE BLUE

Iasked you a question Montgomery
MONTY

I understand exactly what you mean

UNCLE BLUE

Uncle Blue turns Montys gun in his hands He checks the
slides action He ejects the magazine peers at the top
cartridge slaps the magazine back into the pistols butt

UNCLE BLUE (CONTD)

Good weapon Accurate
Monty nods

UNCLE BLUE (CONTD)

Polymer frame very good easy to clean

And reliable No jams

Monty shakes his head He turns around for a moment The
Zakharov twins are staring at him Monty turns back Uncle
Blue smiles

UNCLE BLUE (CONTD)

Have you ever fired it At someone I
mean

MONTY
No
UNCLE BLUE

No Good It is a toy for you Not toy
prop A prop for you Like an actor Am I
wrong With the gun you feel more Monty turns again The Zakharov twins have their automatics
out Monty getting desperate turns back to Uncle Blue

MONTY

I never said a word to anyone They came

after me to get to you I know it you

know it They dont care about me But I

never said a word

Uncle Blue makes a gesture and the Zakharovs frighteningly
fast spring forward slamming Kostya to the floor and
holding their pistols to his skull

UNCLE BLUE

I believe you Montgomery When you get
there figure out who is who Find a man
nobody is protecting a man without
people And beat him until his eyes

bleed
Monty stares at Kostya who whimpers on the ground blood
dripping from his nose

UNCLE BLUE (CONTD)

Let them think you are a little bit
crazy but respectful too respectful of
the right men

KOSTYA

Monty --
One of the Zakharovs kicks Kostya in the ribs

UNCLE BLUE

Youre a good-looking boy it wont be
easy for--you But remember I was- - ----
fourteen when I first went And I
survived

(beat)

We do what we have to do to survive
KOSTYA

Monty please Monty

UNCLE BLUE

So now we have this other problem
VALGHOBEK

How many people knew you kept the stuff

inside your sofa cushion Eh Your
girlfriend Kostya who else i

MONTY

UNCLE BLUE

Kostya dimed you outr little brother He
made a call and stole seven years from
your life

VALGHOBEK

They put the clamps on him and instead

of being a man about it taking the time

himself he sold you out

Uncle Blue hands Valghobek Montys pistol Valghobek walks
over to Monty and offers it to him

MONTY

I dont want it

UNCLE BLUE

Its yours You know how to use it

Valghobek holds the pistol by the barrel a small smile on

his face until Monty grabs it from him

MONTY
I know how to use it
UNCLE BLUE

Good This man does not deserve to live

He betrayed you he betrayed me He stole

from you He stole seven years from you

End him

One of the ZakTiaToEwinsragrins at Monty and taps theback of
Kostyas skull with his pistols muzzle

ZAKHAROV

Right here Boom

The Zakharovs back away and Monty crouches down beside his
former friend Kostya struggles to turn his head to make eye
contact with Monty

KOSTY A j

Monty--

MONTY

Dont talk

KOSTYA

No no wait Monty wait please listen
Thad no choice I--

I

( ) f

Monty flicks off the safety and presses the muzzle against
Kostyas skull

Everyone in the room is quiet watching

The only sound is DJ Dusks mix an accelerating industrial
heartbeat

VALGHOBEK

Do it

Kostya weeps softly his big body shuddering

Uncle Blue face impassive behind his heavy beard watches
carefully

ZAKHAROV

He is cockroach Kill him
Montys face is very close to Kostyas

MONTY

(quietly)

You were my friend

f5 KOSTYA

4 Monty --

Monty closes his eyes

When he opens his eyes he flicks the safety back on He
stands

He tosses the gun to Uncle Blue who catches it and frowns

MONTY

It doesnt matter to me Not a goddamn

thing matters to me except this if you

hurt my father Ill kill you both

The Zakharov twins grab Monty and hold him Monty doesnt
struggle he and Uncle Blue stare at each other

Uncle Blue drums the desktop with his fingers Everyone
waits A glass of water on the table trembles from the

distant bass

Finally Uncle Blue nods at Valghobek who opens the office
door The twins release Monty Everyone (except for Kostya
who is face down on the floor) watches him
o
V Monty walks out of the room never looking back

EXT 14TH STREET -- LATER

Monty trudges down the sidewalk followed by Slattery and
Jakob The snow continues to fall and lies thickly drifted

on the crookedly-parked cars on the parking meters on the
spears of the church gate they pass

They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the
stairs disappearing from our view

CLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW

We slowly follow their path backward In the yellow shine of
the streetlights the footprints fill with snow until finally
(the camera still moving backward) they disappear

INT UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION

Monty Frank and Jakob sit with their backs against the
corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand

An OLD MAN wearing a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his
head leans against a blue I-beam that helps support the

ceiling He holds a small radio to his ear we can hear

fragments of Puerto Rican Jibaro music

Jakob chews on his fingernails He cranes his neck to look

down the subway tunnel -- still no train in sight He looks at
Monty
JAKOB

What time is it

But Monty is jnot present he is elsewhere lost in whatever
feveFie occupleshis mind Slatterys eyes are closed-he-
seems to be sleeping

JAKOB CONTD)

Monty
Monty looks up dazed

MONTY
What
JAKOB

Do you know what time it is
Another long pause

MONTY

Its getting late

- - -«- -
The lights of the train come around the bend in the tunnel
INT 4 TRAIN -- LATER

The three men sit side by side as the train shudders through
the darkness Slattery seems to be sleeping again Jakob
stares at his reflected face in the far window

Monty pulls out his wallet and finds the photograph that his
father gave him earlier in the night

INSERT PHOTO
Monty in his firemans helmet standing before his parents
EXTMONTYS BUILDING -- NIGHT

Monty Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop
steps

INT MONTYS BUILDING

They climb the narrow staircase their footfalls echoing off
the tiled walls

INT MONTYS APARTMENT -4

They enter the apartment Doyle is excited to see them he -
pants and spins in little circles sniffing at their boots
Jakob and Slattery fall onto the sofa and lie there like
corpses

Monty opens the bedroom door steps inside and closes it
behind him

INT- MONTYS BEDROOM
Naturelle sleeps on her side facing the window Monty kneels
beside her and takes her hand Her eyes open She smiles for

a second and then quickly sits up

NATURELLE
What time is it

Both of them turn to look at the digital clock on the
nightstand

MONTY

Ive got an hour left Listen --
Naturelle waits as Monty stares down at the bed “J

100

MONTY (CONTD)

I was wrong About you about --
She runs her hand through his hair

NATURELLE
It doesnt matter right now
MONTY

It matters to me
(beat)

NATURELLE
How could I ever hate you
MONTY

Jesus Nat I blew it I really blew it
He stands

NATURELLE

MONTY

Theres one last thing I gotta do

Naturelle doesnt like the sound of this remark She leans
forward and takes his wrist

NATURELLE

Hey Dont go anywhere Stay here with

--MONTY-« wer
Just one last thing

He kisses her again a last fierce kiss and heads for the
door

INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM

Monty grabs the leash off the back of the apartment door and
clips it to Doyles collar

MONTY

Let me take one more walk with Doyle
Slattery and Jakob nod Both are exhausted
EXTEAST END AVENUE LATER

The snow has finally stopped falling

The parked cars lining the avenue look like scoops of vanilla
ice cream glistening below the streetlights The awnings of
the buildings fringed with icicles creak beneath the weight
of the snow

Doyle off his leash charges down the middle of the avenue
carving a trail through the foot-deep powder a drop of ink
rolling down a blank page

Monty follows behind twirling circles with the leash
Slattery and Jakob bring up the rear slogging through the
snow like weary soldiers

The only vehicle on the road is a snow plow half a mile
south its yellow lights flashing

EXTCARL SCHURZ PARK

They cross into the park past the fenced-in gingko trees
climbing the stairs that lead to the esplanade

Doyle spies a squirrel and chases after it but the squirrel
is quicker makes it to a red maple and scrambles up the
trunk to safety

Doyle squats at the foot of the tree staring sadly up “
through the branches 11W7
EXT EAST RIVER ESPLANADE

Across the river is Queens and Queens before sunrise is
beautiful red antennae lights winking to warn pilots the
Pepsi sign glowing in neon script over the bottling plant
white clouds rising from the smokestacks like genies
Behind Queens the sky is beginning to brighten - --

Jakob brushes snow off the iron balustrade leans against it
and stares into the river A string of yellow lights quivers
beneath the waters reflections from the Queensboro Bridge
A red tugboat chugs south

MONTY

It would be good to work a tugboat Be
out on the river all day

He turns to face Jakob

MONTY (CONTD)

So what do you think You ready for Mr
Doyle

Jakob looks at Doyle who is rolling on his back in the snow
kicking his feet in the air like a puppy

JAKOB

He likes the snow

Monty whistles for Doyle and the dog jumps to his feet and
runs over wagging the stump of his tail his muzzle dusted
with snow

MONTY

Ineed a favor Frank

SLATTERY

Anything

Monty refastens the leash onto the dogs collar and ties the
cord around a baluster knotting it twice checking to make
sure its secure

MONTY

Im not going in there like this The

minute they get a look at me Im gone
Monty straightens up and looks directly into Slatterys eyes

MONTY (CONTD)

Make me ugly

Slattery looks dumbfounded He turns to glance at Jakob who
is equally confused

Monty clears the snow off the nearest bench unbuttons his
camels hair coat and lays it down
MONTY (CONTD)

You just said youd do anything So this
is what I need

SLATTERY

I cant do that What are you thinking I
give you a black eye and people wont
fuck with you It wont change anything
Monty steps closer

MONTY

You think I deserve it dont you
Slattery holds his hands up and backs away

SLATTERY

I cant hit you

103 MONTY
I think you can I think you want to a
little bit I think youve wanted to for
years

SLATTERY

Im not doing it
Monty steps closer again

MONTY

SLATTERY

of Naturelle while Im gone
SLATTERY

MONTY

You think I dont see you staring at her
all the time Youve wanted to fuck her
for years

He shoves Slattery hard Slatterys eyes narrow for a moment
but he shakes his head

-- 104

SLATTERY

All right Al 1 right

He turns stiffly and walks away
JAKOB

Come on Come on Monty what are you

doing Tell him youre kidding

Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek the crack
of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade
Jakob falls back against the balustrade clutching his face

JAKOB (CONTD)

Monty I

Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again this time in the
gut and Jakob sinks to his knees gasping He covers his

face with his hands to protect himself

Slattery tackles Monty pinning him to the ground

For a moment everything is still Doyle leashed to the
baluster whines unsure if his master is playing or

fighting

Jakob stunned by the violence watches Slattery stares at
Monty and Monty stares back All of them in the snow their
breath coiling and rising into the sky

Finally Slattery looks away looks past the East River past
Queens He clenches his eyes shut When he opens them we see
the first tears forming

Slattery grabs Montys throat with his left hand and punches
him in the face with his right again and again and again
Doyle howls He tries to jump on Slattery bu t the leash keeps
yanking him back He strains forward fangs bared bu t his
master is three feet too far

Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers no blood

Doyle barking madly keeps jumping for Slattery keeps being
yanked back by the leash
Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himsel f to his
feet

The bloo d puddles by Montys head melting through the snow
and steaming in the air Slattery lost in his anger his
frustration continues swinging

Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him

JAKOB (CONTD)

Stop
Slattery looks up his face wet with tears a webbin g of
saliva between his lips

JAKOB (CONTD)

Jakob grabs the bi g man under the armpits and help s hi m rise
Slattery looks down at Monty who is not moving

SLATTERY

Oh Jesus

Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach Monty
coughs a thick ribbon of blood falling from hi s mouth
Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gentl y pressing
it to Montys brutalized face

Doyle continues to bark the collar digging into his throat

as he struggles to reach his master

Slattery watches speechless his bloodied hand s by his side
Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins
crawling forward

Hold still for a minute Hold still

When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneat h him
Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls an d lowers
him to the snow

JAKOB (CONTD)

Monty pushes himsel f off the ground again and thi s time
manages to keep his balance though he sways lik e a drunk

MONTY

Blood leaks from his nose from his mouth from a deep gash
bisecting one eyebrow The entire left side of his face is
bright red already swelling

Slattery looks at him and moans sits down heavily in the
snow his chin tucked against his chest his right hand
slick with blood covering his face
SLATTERY

He walks over to Slattery wh o sits in the snow sobbing
Monty leans over and kisses his forehead

MONTY (CONTD)

Slattery rocks back and forth hands over his face his
forehead marked with blood

Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder
MONTY (CONTD)

Jakob is stunned by whats happened in the last few minutes
He has no idea what to say

JAKOB

He grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from
them

EXTMONTY S BUILDING -- DAWN (

Naturelle in her down parka sits on the stoop steps She
sees him when hes a block away and we see him from that
distance limping through the snow

Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply She starts walking
toward him but stops after a few steps She can see his face
now

His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesnt notice her
until hes almost upon her When he does see her he smiles
and Naturelle has to look away for a moment

He tries to say something but chokes leans over hands on
his knees and spits up blood

Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps

INT MONTYS LIVING ROOM

He sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a

wet washcloth A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the

coffee table

When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl drops of blood S

fall into the water and bloom W--
MONTY

I dont want you to visit

His voice is rough and slurred his split lip impeding his
diction

She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol wets a cotton ball
presses the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead --
He shudders his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa
cushions

MONTY (CONTD)

I dont want you to see me up there
Naturelle struggles mightily to keep herself together She
continues cleaning his wounds

MONTY (CONTD)
Whyd you stay with me

(beat)
You should have left a long time ago

NATURELLE

(shaking her head)

You idiot

A knock on the door Naturelle goes to answer it We hear
voices that sound very distant Monty peers through his
swollen eyelids at the man walking toward him

CUT TO

MONTYS POV

sunlight and shadows all edges washed away

The mans face is a pale oval that bends and splits when he
speaks

Mr Brogan kisses Naturelle on the cheek and she embraces the
older man When she lets go he walks to the front door pick s
up the suitcase and leaves the apartment

Monty stands still looking at Naturelle

NATURELLE

Wait a second

She goes to the kitchen and Monty rocks back and forth on his
bootheels When she returns she holds a plastic ba g filled
with ice cubes

She makes him hold the bag against the side of his face They
dont move for a moment her hand on top of his hand the ba g
of ice pressed to his jaw

She nods but says nothing biting her lip tears beginning to
roll down her face

stairwell The cubes glitter and disappear before clattering
on the linoleum three floors below

is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have

been swept clean

INT MR BROGANS HONDA
Mr Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully
into the seat then leans over to unlock the drivers door

After Mr Brogan starts the engine they wait for a moment

for the windows to defrost

MR BROGAN

FDR is closed I figured wed go up

to Route 17 and then 211 takes us right

Monty and his father sit in silence letting the engine warm

MONTY

Mr Brogan shifts into drive

MR BROGAN
Of course it wasnt Naturelle

INT MR BROGANS HONDA -- MORNING

They drive up First Avenue Monty looks out the window and
watches the city roll by Its his last look for a long time

and he wants to remember everything

A WOMAN wearing a mans overcoat sprinkles salt in front of a

shuttered butcher shop Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds
behind them huffing and puffing with exaggerated fatigue

A NEWSPAPER VENDOR sits on a blue milk crate sipping coffee
from a paper cup while his CURLY-HAIRED SON snaps icicles
from the kiosks eaves

A POLICE OFFICER hands on his hips stares under the opened
hood of his cruiser while his PARTNER leans against the
drivers-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie

At a red light Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily
alongside them A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves Monty
waves back

The boy points at his window letters have been finger-drawn

on the frosted glass T-O-M

Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his
own frosted window M-O-N-

Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away

They drive north

MONTY

I always thought Id make you proud of

me

Mr Brogan turns to look at Monty and then turns back to the
road

MONTY (CONTD)

CLOSE on Montys ravaged face on his eyelids

Mr Brogan keeps talking and New York City melts away

As Monty speaks his children exchange glances They cant
really believe what theyre hearing but they know their
father is telling the truth

MR BROGAN (VO) (CONTD)

You tell them the whole thing And then

you ask them if they know how lucky they

are to be there

Monty looks at his family He is awed by their existence by
the life he has created He looks at Naturelle still

beautiful in old age and she smiles back at him
