LETHAL WEAPON

Shane Black
FADE IN
CITY OF ANGELS

lies spread out beneath us in all its splendor like a
bargain basement Promised Land

CAMERA SOARS DIPS WINDS its way SLOWLY DOWN DOWN
bringing us IN OVER the city as we

SUPER MAIN TITLES
TITLES END as we --

SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD a lush high-rise apartment complex
The moon reflected in glass

CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH billowing curtains
INTO the inner sanctum of a penthouse apartment and
here boys and girls is where we lose our breath
because --

spread-eagled on a sumptuous designer sofa lies the
single most beautiful GIRL in the city

Blonde hair A satin nightgown that positively glows
Sam Cooke MUSIC crooning from five hundred dollar
SPEAKERS

PASTEL colors Window walls New wave furniture tor-
tured into weird shapes It looks like robots live here

On the table next to the sleeping Venus lies an open
bottle of pills next to that a mirror dusted with
cocaine

She rouses herself to smear some powder on her gums
As she does we see from her eyes that she is thoroughly
completely whacked out of her mind

She stands stumbles across the room pausing to glance
at a photograph on the wall

Two men Soldiers Young rough-hewn arms around each
other

The Girl throws open the glass doors steps out onto a
balcony and there beneath her lies all of nighttime
LA Panoramic splendor Her hair flies her expression
rapt as she stands against this sea of technology She
is beautiful

On the balcony railing beside her stand three potted
plants

The Girl sees them picks one up Looks over the balcony
railing It is ten stories down to the parking lot
she squints holds the plant over the edge
1A

GIRL
Red car

Drops the plant Down it goes spiralling end over end

-- until finally BAM -- SHATTERS Dirt flies A
red Chevy is now minus a WINDSHIELD The Girl takes
another plant

GIRL
Green car

She drops it Green Dodge Ten stories below BAM
Impact city Scratch one paint job Grabs the final

plant and holds it out saying

GIRL
Blue car

POW GLASS SHATTERS Dirt sprays A blue BMW this

time The Girl loves this game her expression is
slightly crazed She reaches for another plant --
There arent any Her smile fades -- And for a moment

just a moment the dullness leaves her eyes and she is
suddenly incredibly sober And tears fill her eyes as
she looks over the edge --

GIRL
Yellow car

And jumps the railing Plummets head over heels like a
rag doll Hits the yellow car spot on She lies dead
like an extinguished dream Still beautiful

CUT TO
EXT BENEATH THE PIER NIGHT 1A

FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS are camped out under the
pier warming themselves around a small bonfire laughing
loudly Christmas decorations dangle above them from the
pier and empty beer cans litter the sand around them

CAMERA PUSHES IN to discover an old collie tied to one of
the pilings Then we realize that the dog is being tor-
mented by the dock workers They flick lighted matches

at him Shake their beers and spray him in the face

These guys are not rocket scientists

The dog cowers tugging bn the rope Tries to get away
All to the great amusement of its tormentors

One of them turns laughing --

As a shadowy FIGURE strides calmly up to the fire
Long hair

Cigarette dangling from-lower lip

Shirt-tails hanging loose below the waist
Nothing threatening in his manner as he plops down

the men smiling
They are immediately on their guard

RIGGS (FIGURE)
Happy holidays Mind if I join

you

PUNK 1
Yes

PUNK 2
Fuck off

beside

Riggs smiles at him innocently Strokes the collies fur

with one hand

With the other he reaches intb a paper sack and produces
a spanking new bottle of Jack Daniels possibly the finest

drink mankind has yet produced

RIGGS
I need help drinking this Cool

The dock workers exchange glances There seems to be no

harm in this One of them frowns

PUNK 1
You a homo

RIGGS
Do I look like a homo

PUNK 1

You got long hair Homos got long

hair

PUNK 3
I hate homos Arrggh

Riggs shakes his head laughs
RIGGS

Boy you guys are terrific You
make me laugh you just do

At which point appropriately enough Punk 4 shakes a

beer and sprays it in the old collies face

The DOG pulls away WHINING
Riggs leans forward

RIGGS
This your dog Nice dog

And then he proceeds to do a peculiar thing

He starts to talk to the dog --
in what seems to be the dogs own language
Very weird folks

He coos snuffles barks softly then withdraws
listening his ear to the dogs muzzle

Riggs nods Frowns

The others look on puzzled

Then Riggs looks at each of the four dock workers

RIGGS
Huh- You know what He says he
doesnt want you to spray beer in
his face He says he just hates
that

A pause Uncomfortable Then --

PUNK 1
Oh he does
(beat)

Well mister why dont you ask
him what he likes

The others snicker Riggs simply nods

RIGGS
Okay

And once again begins to confer with the dog Listens
intently piecing together what he is hearing

RIGGS
What You want oh Oh
hell no I couldnt do that
Nossirree bob you little nut

He ruffles the dogs hair
The men are more puzzled than ever as Riggs turns and
says

RIGGS
(chuckling)
Get this He wants me to beat
the shit out of you guys

Everything stops A cloud passes over the assembled
faces and a pin-dropping silence ensues

Riggs completely heedless once again attends to the dog

RIGGS
Whats that The one in the
middle ‘is a stupid fat duck’

What

(listens again)
Oh Oh A ‘stupid fat fuck
Right

He looks up shakes his head
RIGGS
Boy this dog is pissed

The one in the middle grabs Riggs by the collar
Hoists him to his feet Gulp

Stands staring down at Riggs whose eyes are completely
neutral like a snakes

PUNK 1
Buddy youre shortening your
life span

He flicks open a mean-looking switchblade
Riggs is dead meat

So why then does he choose this moment to execute a
Three Stooges routine consisting of nose tweak eye
gouge and rotating fist that bobs the dock worker on
the head

Hes nuts or something

Riggs steps back and adopts a neutral fighting stance
The others begin to circle

The DOG BARKS Riggs turns to the dog but his eyes never
leave his grinning attackers

RIGGS
(to the collie)
Whats that You want me to
take the knife away and break
his elbow

Circling

Riggs watching them his eyes beginning to dance
Breathing slow and even

RIGGS
But that would be excruciatingly
painful

Something inside Riggs is gearing up the others can
perhaps sense it their smiles falter a bit they crouch
combat-ready

Riggs eyes blazing

RIGGS
And if I separated the fat ones
shoulder hed probably scream

No doubt about it We know from the look in Riggs eyes
hes nuts He wants the fight badly all four of them
at once

And then Punk 1 springs
Big mistake
Needless to say mincemeat is made of the four meddlesome
dog-torturers

The beach is littered with their writhing forms as Riggs
does finally what he set out to do

Unties the dog

Starts to go
As he does he pats his shirt

Pats his jeans Realizes his wallet has flown free
during the fracas

Scoops to retrieve it from its resting place on the sand

where it lies open and as it lies open yes folks that
is a badge we see

Riggs we realize is an officer of the law

He lights a cigarette and notices the collie seated
Frowns

RIGGS
Okay skeezix Go on Get outta
here

He begins to walk away The dog remains close at his
heels Following him

RIGGS
No no Dont follow me Im an
asshole Go away

The dog sits obediently and Riggs walks away
He cant help it looks back over his shoulder

Sees the dog watching him with a beseeching expression
Pitiful

RIGGS
Aw shit

He signals the dog

RIGGS
Awright Move it Lets go

The COLLIE BARKS happily and dashes toward him through
the surf kicking up sand and water

As they shuffle off against the palm-lined skyline we
hear supered Riggs voice

RIGGS (VO)
So You live in the area Whats
your major
And so on as we

EXT CHRISTMAS TREE LOT - DAY

Martin Riggs and three lot employees are gathered around
the liftgate of a truck bearing a load of Christmas trees
The truck shields them from the view of customers picking
out trees in the lot

19A
The lot employees are actually DRUG DEALERS They look
around nervously in all directions as Riggs tastes a
sample of their wares

RIGGS
Good stuff

DRUG DEALER ONE

Okay Lets do it How much

his pocket)

in twenties and small bills

RIGGS

badge The Drug Dealers at first look startled then
disbelieving

DRUG DEALER ONE
Fuck you man That badge aint

crazy fuck

Riggs eyes begin to blaze His nostrils flare Like
a maniac he lunges at Drug Dealer Two

RIGGS
You callin me crazy You
think Im crazy You wanna see
crazy Ill show you crazy
This is crazy

Riggs then proceeds to slap and pummel the Drug Dealer
in the manner of the Three Stooges complete with
WoO-WOO sound effects

But he ends the routine by pulling a nine-millimeter
Baretta from behind his back and pressing it against
the neck of Drug Dealer Two

RIGGS
Thats a real badge Ima real
cop And this is a real gun
(to the other two
Drug Dealers)
Face down on the ground Arms
and legs out Do it now

Dealer One and Three begin to follow orders but Riggs
sees a flicker in their eves that him to trouble
He spins around -- a FOURTH DRUG DEALER is behind him

with a shotgun The SHOTGUN EXPLODES Riggs ducks
allowing Drug Dealer Two to take the full force of the
‘blast in the face

Riggs rolls in the sawdust FIRING his BERETTA
Dealer Four takes a bullet between the eyes

Dealer Two now has an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in his hand

It CHATTERS in Riggs direction Sawdust and pine
needles fly in the air -- but Riggs is able to blow
him away

One more Drug Dealer left Riggs cant find him
His eyes dart in all directions Where is he

Behind Riggs thats where He presses a revolver to
the back of Riggs head taking Riggs Baretta from

him and tucking it into his belt

Thats when

FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS 19B
come running from their stakeout positions around the

lot But they stop short when they see that Riggs is
being held with a gun pointed to his head
19C

The Drug Dealer begins to move with Riggs toward a van
parked nearby

RIGGS
(to officers)
Shoot him Shoot him

DRUG DEALER

(to Riggs)
Shut up
RIGGS
(to Drug Dealer)
Fuck you

(to officers)
Shoot him Shoot him

The narcotics officers dont know what to do They
are frustrated Helpless Immobilized

Riggs sees the van looming up The van means defeat
The van means disgrace The van means victory for the
bad guys and we know that Riggs would rather die than
be the instrument of the Dealers escape

CLOSE ON RIGGS AND DRUG DEALER 19C

The veins are popping out in Riggs neck The Drug
Dealer is getting nervous and panicky His gun hand
is trembling The barrel of the gun jiggles against
the back of Riggs head

RIGGS
(to Drug Dealer)
Do it asshole Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

DRUG DEALER
Shut the fuck up

They move closer to the van The narcotics officers
have their guns poised for action but dont dare use
them

DRUG DEALER

Guns down Guns down
RIGGS

(to officers)
Shoot him Kill him

(to Dealer)
Pull the trigger

(to officers)
Waste him

(to Dealer)

Shoot me
(to officers)
Kill him

The Dealer is so freaked now that his grip on Riggs
slips momentarily -- and Riggs sees his opening

He spins Kicks the Dealer in the groin Dislocates

his arm -- sending tlie gun flying Riggs retrieves his
Baretta from the Dealers belt and shoves the barrel
into the Dealers face

Riggs entire body quakes with rage His finger begins
to squeeze back on the trigger He wants to kill the
guy so bad he can taste it and yet he doesnt do it

The other officers arrive and step between Riggs and
the Dealer

Riggs turns away Breatliing hard Adrenalin pumping
He tucks the Baretta into his belt then notices that
his hand is covered with the spilled blood of one of
the Drug Dealers

It gives Riggs pause For a moment he just looks at

it

HOLD ON Riggs VERY CLOSE And the look in his eyes

Riggs resembles a bag person Unshaven limp dirty
hair grimy leather jacket

BACK TO SCENE
He frowns says

MURTAUGH

her late dinner

BURKE
Ho Rog- Im not through yet

things

MURTAUGH

He is still looking at Riggs who is slowly wandering
from desk to desk smoking -- Stopping near the desk with
the holstered gun

MURTAUGH
Oh perfect Can I trade in my
life for a new one

At which point across the room Riggs removes the hol-
stered gun and hefts it curiously Suddenly all hell
breaks loose

MURTAUGH
Gun

He bolts like a cheetah

Cops dive for cover a secretary shrieks and Murtaugh
goes plowing through the squad room like an express
train blowing people out of the way -- Cops grabbing
for their holsters -- Riggs meanwhile looking around
frantically hes trying to find the guy with the gun
who is of course himself

Murtaugh takes a flying leap sails across

the desk going for the glory And Riggs in the
blink of an eye simply ducks and flips Murtaugh
neatly over one shoulder There is a hideous crash
of BREAKING GLASS and OVERTURNING FURNITURE Ouch
McCaskey meanwhile screams to Burke

McCASKEY
What the shit is going on

Burke sighs shakes his’ head

BURKE
Roger just met his new partner

Murtaughs back Riggs however notices And springs
into action Before the rich guy can fire Riggs foot

Drags him to the bottom Murtaugh looks on wild-eyed

On the bottom of the pool is a vinyl tomb Murtaugh

dives in Swims to the bottom Yanks and strains but

Flying shrapnel A wall of flame Riggs hits the dirt
smothering the Little black Kid Murtaugh dives for cover
behind a telephone pole A piece of shrapnel imbeds it-

A sprawling expensive villa nestled on the side of a
bluff overlooking the ocean Terraces verandahs
gazebos Architecture that merits three syllables The
ocean looks cheap by comparison A memorial service is
in progress A group of people mostly young friends
of Amanda Lloyd all are dressed in funeral black

81 NEARBY --

Martin Riggs is collapsed in a lawn chair smoking and
looking thoroughly out of place Seeing the girl he
frowns puffs on his cigarette and rolls a quarter
over his knuckles like a stage magician Nimble trained

fingers A thoroughly unconscious habit
ANOTHER ANGLE

Dick Lloyd looks worse than ever He stands staring
out over the ocean -- as a hand comes out of nowhere
grabs his shoulder and spins him roughly around Face-

in the classic gesture of ulcer-carriers everywhere
Opens the fridge removes a carton of milk There must
be three cases of the stuff Drinks turns to Murtaugh
A man at the end of his’ rope

LLOYD
It goes all the way back to the
war

MURTAUGH

Im listening

LLOYD
I ended up working for a group
called Air America CIA front
secretly ran the entire war out of
Laos I was part of a special
unit called Shadow Company Mercs
Trained killers When Charley was
bringing in heroin to finance the
VC government Shadow Company
went in and burned it all down We
killed everybody But we also
formed a plan

MURTAUGH
Keep talking

LLOYD
No No way

Murtaugh grabs a framed picture of Amanda slams it
down on a wooden bul--cher block The GLASS SHATTERS
Lloyd stares

MURTAUGH
Tell me

Lloyd flinches Leans back a dreamy look in his eyes
Speaks from very far away

LLOYD
(softly)
Nothing wrong with the kids
Roger Were all fucked up Us
old bastards Were killing them

And suddenly there is a gun in his hand Aimed at Murtaugh

LLOYD
Back off

MURTAUGH
Oh swell Good move

LLOYD
Im not kidding Im in too far
now

Murtaugh does not budge Lloyd cocks the hammer

LLOYD
The gun is silenced Roger

Murtaugh stares him down

MURTAUGH

Eyes

like fire

Whats it gonna be buddy

You gonna save my life

just so

you can snuff me twenty years

later

LLOYD

Things are different now

MURTAUGH
I guess

A moment

Lloyd stares intently

Finger sweating on the

trigger
MURTAUGH
If you can do it do it I dont
fucking care anymore
LLoyd blinks Swallows Another moment Finally -- He
lowers the gun Sighs
LLOYD
What do you want to know
Murtaugh relaxes visibly And thats when two things

happen The picture WINDOW GLASS suddenly COLLAPSES

Falls TINKLING into a million shards

milk in Lloyds hand pops
front of his black suit

blood seeps out of his shirt

LLOYD
Roger --

And the carton of

spurting milk all over the
He frowns
dribbling milk Blinks And his eyes snap open wide

Stares at the
as
spattering the floor

With his dying breath he leaps in front of Murtaugh
Takes the SECOND BULLET The one meant for Murtaugh
It blows him into Roger takes them both to the floor in
a breath-crushing impact More BULLETS CHOP the kitchen

China PLATES BURST into a glassy spray
staining the walls

and gushes
then a man possessed

MURTAUGH
Riggs

EXT LAWN

Murtaughs voice is far away
lawn chair Notices two
normal Nobody has heard the
the kitchen window

Food spatters
Murtaugh rolls free

Screams out the window

Riggs looks up from his
One Everything seems
shots Two The glass in

something strange what the hell
broken

someone broke the glass

And Riggs is on his feet in the blink of an eye

BACK INSIDE
Murtaugh is at the window Gun pointed

MURTAUGH
Riggs

MURTAUGHS POV

reveals a crowd of people milling back and forth he

has no idea where the sniper is and suddenly BAM --
The wood blows out not two inches from his head and he
ducks and meanwhile -- back outside

MARTIN RIGGS

Hes on the move He jogs trots runs Noticing
lone man in black striding quickly across the lawn
striding into the crowd toward the edge of the bluff
Things happen fast now pay attention as -- The man
turns sees Riggs Riggs sees him and the man is
none other than Mr Joshua Crew cut Sunglasses

Moving fast

MURTAUGH

diving out the window Hits Rolls comes up Scream-
ing waving at Riggs

RIGGS

Gun out moving fast shoving through the crowd people

screaming now Jesus hes got a gun -- Running

across the lawn Murtaugh thirty yards behind moving
hard and fast both guns drawn pushingshoving knock-
ing people ass over teacups and meanwhile let us not

forget --

JOSHUA

moving at a dead run now gun out at the edge of the
cliff People all around him confused I mean Jesus

what the hell is all this shooting about and Riggs cant
get a clear shot Hes sweeping the gun back and forth

bodies crossing in front of him all the wrong bodies
Goddammit Moving forward shouting

RIGGS
Lie down Down
Murtaugh springing hell bent for leather -- and folks

grab your hats because just then a BELL COBPA HELI-
COPTER crests the edge of the bluff

An explosion of sound

As it rises like an avenging angel

Hovers shattering the air with turbo-throb sandblasting
the hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt tables
chairs everything thats not nailed down

a

Screaming chaos frenzy
Three words that apply to this scene

And in the midst of all this -- Joshua steps onto the
chopper and is hauled inside

No expression

The total professional

And then my friends its bye-bye time The CHOPPER
ROARS like a behemoth tilts --

slips over the side and plummets away

Slick Very slick
Except Martin Riggs it not impressed

Hes still running you see

Dives flat at the edge of the cliff nearly flings
himself over the damn edge

GUN extended like its part of his arm

Finger flat on the trigger

Blowing SHOT after SHOT at the retreating chopper
BAM-BAM-BAM His face contorted in a rictus of
animal concentration

And he wings the chopper even POP
spray of fiberglass but nossir no cigar
cause the damn chopper flies away

He lies flat

Stares

People screaming running away

Murtaugh standing over him staring down at this animal
with a gun who even now refuses to look away from the
retreating chopper whose gun even now continues to

follow its course out over the sea

Martin Riggs walks slowly down the boulevard In one
hand he carries a snapshot of Amanda Lloyd Male pros-
titutes take one look at him and flee

He stops to light a cigarette As he does -- He notices
a reflection in the silver lighter

Two pinpoints of light Moving He throws away the cig-
arette Spins drawing his gun HEADLIGHTS as a car
comes barreling out of the darkness Bearing down on

FIRES again sprints for cover -- AS a mercenary leans
out of the car window with a pump SHOTGUN Triggers

THREE BLASTS at Riggs The first two blow out chunks of
scenery The third takes Riggs in the chest Blows him
backward through a store window GLASS SHATTERS He hits
the ground in a heap The CAR SHRIEKS off into the night

is a tiny envelope with SEASONS GREETINGS emblazoned
across the front A note is attached with a paper clip
One side reads DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH On the other
side is a message in block capitals

YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS REALLY PRETTY NAKED

Murtaugh tears open the envelope afraid to breathe
Inside is a Polaroid snapshot The audience may get a
glimpse of it or they may not Either way the effect
it has on Murtaugh is devastating He drops the snapshot
like a live snake Backs away stumbles into the wall
Shakes his head

MURTAUGH
Bastards bastards

Riggs looks on stunned The TELEPHONE RINGS RINGS

Hangs up slowly stares straight ahead On the table a

Trish Murtaugh looks like she could come apart at any
moment

She walks around the bedroom slowly
Touching things

Touching her daughters possessions

Murtaugh enters They look at each other
He hands her the 22

MURTAUGH
Take this Until its over I
dont want you to let it out of
your sight
His wife nods Runs a hand through her hair Shifts
from one foot to the other

MURTAUGH
Theyre not going to hurt her
If I do exactly what they say

A moment Then

TRISH
What about you

Murtaugh says nothing

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Riggs has his shirt off and is carefully removing
slivers of glass from his shoulder Cigarette dangling
from his lips

He hears a noise

And spins startled

RIGGS POV - SIX-YEAR-OLD CARRIE MURTAUGH 103

Adorable in a blue nightgown Rickles the cat cradled
lovingly in her arms

Riggs relaxes
Smiles

Carrie walks over to him

RIGGS
Hey Missy

CARRIE
I cant sleep

RIGGS
Uh-oh Not good

He scoops her up

RIGGS
Whos your friend

CARRIE
Rickles the cat

RIGGS
Huh He is a cutie

Carrie looks at him then

And she does a peculiar thing

Slowly she reaches out

Riggs looking on

And touches his back Runs her tiny hand over the knife
scar beneath his shoulder

Fascinated by it

CARRIE
Ouch

Riggs looks at her Smiles and whispers softly

RIGGS
Yeah
(beat)
Ouch

And he suddenly hugs the little girl for all hes worth
Closes his eyes tight

In that moment every single year catches up to Riggs
and he looks for a moment incredibly old and so very
very tired

104 INT LIVING ROOM - LATER 104
Carrie is asleep on the couch snuggled beneath a knitted

afghan Riggs and Murtaugh stand across the room con-
ferring in hushed tones

RIGGS

You want her back youve got to
take her away from them

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
Good We do this my way

A pause Riggs studies Murtaugh Then

RIGGS

Murtaugh stares at him for a moment Then he finally
speaks

MURTAUGH
- How good are you
RIGGS

MURTAUGH
Are you only crazy or are
you as good as you say you
are
There is a pause Then
RIGGS

No one can touch me

MURTAUGH
Good Kill every fucking one of
them Okay

At which point my friends a light flickers on behind
Riggs eyes

We see grim determination sure
But we also sense something else oddly enough
Anticipation

Riggs is a machine and the machine is well
revving up He looks at Murtaugh

RIGGS
Get half I11 kill the other
half
A moment passes between them This will be the most
devastating night of their lives They will probably
die

Driving Relentlessly onward his face locked in a mask

of contained fury Dust billows past the windows Wind

He keeps driving straining his eyes ahead focusing

through the hundred-degree shimmer Noticing finally

stiffens Leans forward punches the cigarette lighter

Riggs stops moving Scowls at Joshua and says nothing
Joshua smiles

JOSHUA
Youre just in time for a lot of
pain

Oh you will be I daresay
youll be shocked

Kendo snickers in the corner

RIGGS
Whos the chin

JOSHUA
Shhh Dont make him mad

RIGGS
My mistake Whos the pleasant
Oriental psychopath

JOSHUA
His name is Kendo and he has
forgotten more about dispensing
pain than you will ever know

RIGGS
Terrific Listen guys can we
get some Mister Bubble in here

JOSHUA

Please shut up

(studies Riggs)
My my look at all those scars

(beat)
See Martin we have a problem
Since we have Murtaugh we really
dont even need you But I
believe in being thorough

Across the room Kendo throws a switch A mechanical
HUMMING fills the room

JOSHUA
Our problem -- and yours too
is that we have some
merchandise to deliver A rather
large shipment were all very
excited It would be unfortunate
however if we showed up with the
goods and found ourselves
surrounded by fifty cops

RIGGS
That would be a shame

JOSHUA
Indeed So you see Martin it
is essential that we find out
how much the police know

RIGGS
We dont know shit You killed
Lloyd before he could talk
JOSHUA
I wish I could believe you
Unfortunately I dont So if
youll be kind enough to tell
us all you know I will kill
you quickly

RIGGS
Such a deal I should worry

JOSHUA
Oh indeed you should See
Martin you ------- talk to us

He gestures to Kendo who approaches He is carrying a
very ominous device a sponge attached to a portable
dry-cell battery casing Joshua frowns at Riggs

JOSHUA
Do you vomit

RIGGS
Sometimes

Joshua nods Sighs

JOSHUA
Back before prison reform the
staff at Sing Sing invented a
rather unusual form of punishment
Its know as the hummingbird
treatment Are you familiar

RIGGS
Please no tickling I hate
tickling

JOSHUA

The patient is chained naked

in a bathtub full of water A
bath is then administered using

a battery powered sponge The
pain is said to be so excruciating
that after twenty minutes most
men are either insane or dead

Riggs is silent

JOSHUA
I thought youd like it I can
of course kill you now Simply
tell me what you know

RIGGS
Guess were in for a long night
‘Cause I dont know scratch

JOSHUA
Well find out Kendo
The Oriental moves forward He brandishes the sponge
battery hookup Dips it into a bucket of water Riggs
is sweating

JOSHUA
Feel free to scream

RIGGS
Havent you guys heard of
yuletide cheer

Kendo hits Riggs with the sponge Riggs screams A
high lunatic scream

Thrashes in the water splashing Kendo whipping from
side to side as the room spirals back and forth out of
focus Kids dont try this at home Kendo removes the
device Riggs falls backward Thumps against the tub
Sucking air Moaning

Riggs looks at him Dripping hate

He does not injure them

He simply kills them The whole room Everyone stand-

door and escapes Riggs chain moves like a live thing
Snapping here Striking there Mercs try to draw their
guns -- And suddenly their hands are shattered wrecks

One merc draws a bead on Rianne almost gets off a shot
because Riggs is across the room Without missing a beat

kills him instantly Ouch He goes down FIRING use-

beside an armed merc -- Swings the bat with hurricane

force A sickening impact The bat breaks in half
Riggs spins combat-ready Scans the room No one left
to kill Using only the element of surprise he has
taken out an entire room in hand-to-hand combat He
steps in front of Murtaugh without missing a beat Cuts
him loose with a borrowed knife

RIGGS
Work your circulation

Crosses to Rianne cuts her free She collapses sobbing
into his arms

RIGGS
Ssshhh- No time Come on

He scoops up handguns throws them to Murtaugh Takes
for himself a pump shotgun possibly the same one used
against him earlier Murtaugh stares dumbfounded at the
body count

RIGGS
Theyre all dead Lets get
out of here

EXT HALLWAY - SAME TIME 143
The three of them

On the run moving hard and fast They scramble down the

hallway Riggs in the lead as -- a merc ducks around the
corner sees them Ducks back Riggs FIRES through the
wall BLAM -- A corpse falls into view They keep

moving Downstairs A-round another corner Moving
moving

The three of them keep moving Rushing headlong toward

a sign marked EXIT They may actually make it Or not
For at that moment Mr Joshua looms up behind them and
tosses something in their direction Ducks’ back out of
sight Its a live grenade The grenade hits the floor
Clatters Riggs stops instantly He knows the sound
Spins Dives Scoops up the GRENDADE and chucks it with

all his might It bounces downstairs and EXPLODES at the
foot of the steps

EXT BUILDING - NIGHT
Joshua skids to a halt next to a sedan

He slams the door and ROARS off down Hollywood Boulevard
The crowd parts like the Red Sea People are screaming

And suddenly the doors burst open -- As Riggs Murtaugh

and Rianne come skidding out onto the sidewalk in hot
pursuit Murtaugh shoves his daughter back as Joshua

FIRES out the window of the car BULLETS lash the pave-
ment The crowd shrieks The CAR SCREECHES away

ANOTHER ANGLE

A beat cop comes running up and Murtaugh shoves Rianne
in his direction Flashes his badge

MURTAUGH
Get her out of here

ANOTHER ANGLE - MURTAUGH AND RIGGS

go running after the car Side by side Beaten Bloody
Naked from the waist up Murtaugh FIRING his PISTOL Shot
after blazing shot

Riggs unloading with the M-16 on three-shot mode the
muzzle flash blinding the noise DEAFENING -- Until
pedestrians swarm suddenly into the line of fire

Blocking them Except Murtaugh wont give up He runs
after the car shouting

MURTAUGH
Out of the way Move

His GUN CLICKS empty He tosses it aside Pulls another
from his waistband The car Far away FIRES FOUR more
SHOTS Collapses in the street Nearly unconscious

Crawls forward after the car blood streaming from his
broken nose Going on sheer guts Finally gives out
Slumps in a heap Riggs kneels beside him as a police CAR
ROARS up to them flashers spinning Riggs is a man pos-
sessed We PANA-GLIDE with him as he runs forward M-16
in one hand Badge in the other

RIGGS
Get an ambulance

He takes off after the Joshuas car On foot Someone
better tell this guy to lighten up The car is far ahead
racing onto a freeway on-ramp Riggs runs Sweat pours
off him Seeing the car on the ramp he changes direction
Starts running an intercept course Leaps out into the
street -- Spins as a TRUCK BLARES ut of nowhere BRAKES
SQUEALING HORN SHRIEKING Somersaults over the hood
Lands Keeps moving Barrels across the street Faster
now Even faster than before Feet pounding Gun
swinging Dashing out onto the freeway overpass Where
without stopping he promptly jumps the guardrail Drops
through space And lands thump -- Atop the big
green freeway sign Swings like an acrobat Dangles

from the sign twenty feet above the ground Levels the
M-16 one-handed switches it to full auto Waits

BENEATH HIM 147

Joshuas CAR comes SCREAMING through the underpass doing
eighty Riggs unleashes the GUN It BLAZES with cruel

FIRE STPAFES the back of the car Sure enough BLOWS
out both TIRES -- Throwing the EHICLE into eadly SKID

-- Slewing across the freeway -- STRIKING the GUARDRAIL

at sixty-plus It slides for a full hundred yards send-

ing up a shower of sparks The back tires disintegrate

in a trail of burning rubber The CAR GRINDS to a halt

The door opens and Joshua rolls out Riggs FIRES Kicks
up a cloud of cement near the merc Joshua RETURNS FIRE

ANOTHER ANGLE 148

Big chunks of thefreeway SIGN BLOW OUT next to Riggs
-head He is showered with wooden debris

Riggs lowers the gun Lets go and drops twenty feet to
the pavement Lands rolls comes up A CAR swerves
around him CRASHES into the guardrail Riggs doesnt
even look Instead he begins to walk He is a fucking
juggernaut

UP AHEAD 149
Joshua turns sees Riggs -- and stops
JOSHUA

Okay you bastard lets see
whos better
They are separated by perhaps two hundred yards Joshua
snaps his rifle to his shoulder Eyes glued to the scope
Riggs swings his own rifle into position -- and weve got
the showdown at the 0K Corral A battle of wits Each
one scanning through the scope

Looking for a clear shot as CARS SWERVE around and
between them The crosshairs sweep the freeway Perfect
concentration Riggs Joshua Two soldiers And
suddenly the shot is there Joshua sights in on Riggs
position Only problem is Riggs rifle is pointed right
at the CAMERA He is sighted in on Joshua Simultaneous
They FIRE at the exact same moment TWO SHOTS Two
distinct RIFLE CRACKS Riggs takes it in the shoulder
Blown backward Joshua goes down winged Riggs

Joshua Each looks like shit They struggle to their

feet And thats when a car backs up into Riggs at
thirty miles an hour Broadsides him Sends him flying

150 UP AHEAD 150

Joshua rushes up to a stalled car Throws open the door
Yanks out the driver hops behind the wheel ROARS away

CUT TO
151 EXT BUILDING - SAME TIME 151
An ambulance shudders to a halt and two ORDERLIES hop
out Uniformed COPS are struggling to hold back the

crowd One of the Orderlies rushes up

ORDERLY
Where is he Officer

COP
Right over there

He points -- and suddenly frowns There is no one there
Murtaugh is gone Nowhere to be seen

CUT TO
52 EXT BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME 52
A sleek black VAN careens around the corner
52A INT VAN 52A

A MERC is driving foot glued to the pedal THE GENERAL
sits sweating in the back seat

52B ANOTHER ANGLE 52B

The headlights flash wildly as the car roars down the
alley

153A

153C

The General stares ahead and suddenly ------- eee
‘Cause wouldnt you know it theres ROGER MURTAUGH
Fifty yards away Standing in the middle of the street

ANOTHER ANGLE 153

There is no reason for Murtaugh to be standing He is a
walking testament to mans ability to bloody himself

And hes pissed The Merc sees him snarls -- punches
the gas Murtaugh holds his ground He can barely stand
And then he does a peculiar thing He examines his hand

No question A definite tremble Scowls Stretches
Cracks his neck

Shifts from foot to foot steadying himself He has one
shot The numbers are falling its all coming down --
And hes ready The van comes barreling in Doing fifty
Now or never

MURTAUGH
No way you live No way

He cross-draws with lightning swiftness BAM The

REPORT is DEAFENING The WINDSHIELD promptly SHATTERS

And the Merc sprouts a neat third eye Perfect shot

Dead center The van swerves Murtaugh steps out of the
way Deadly calm As the van careens past -- He salutes
the General Watches expressionless The CAR SLAMS
into a telephone pole and rolls over GRINDING METAL

An ERUPTION of GLASS It continues to roll like some

great beast crumpling and folding like an accordion

Comes to rest upside down in a sea of glass

INT VAN 153A
The General is pinned beneath a crumpled door-frame
struggling to break free as FLAMES lick upward from the

ruptured gas tank

And then the General sees something which ruins his whole
day

The Mercs corpse sprawled over the steering column
with a shiny metal GRENADE attached to his belt
Flames dance around the grenade

ANOTHER ANGLE 153C
The General squirms strains yanks for all hes worth

Fingers reaching out for the grenade06
Flames burning his outstretched hand cee cece cere ene

And it is as they say all she wrote
EXT ROADWAY 154

Murtaugh is walking like a zombie Away from the VAN
Gun held loosely at his side Suddenly -- It BLOWS sky
high A tower of fire Blows Murtaugh flat Knocks

him ass over teacups ECHOES down the street Turns

night into day for one brief instant And then -- Then
something truly incredible happens For the first time
in nearly a century -- it begins to snow in Hollywood
Murtaugh looks up a What the hell expression on

his face Sure enough --
HEROIN

is sifting down on the night air ten million dollars’
worth A cloud over the entire’ street Swirling in
the breeze

MURTAUGH 156

gets slowly to his feet checking for broken bones If
it wasnt busted already apparently its okay now Time
passes A hand rests on his shoulder

MARTIN RIGGS 157

Stands next to him Cops swarm behind them The heroin
snow continues to fall The wreck burns Riggs looks at
Murtaugh Murtaugh looks at Riggs The two most physi-
cally abused men in film history

MURTAUGH
Well shit

RIGGS
Try not to breathe youll see
pink elephants

MURTAUGH
Joshua

RIGGS
Got away

MURTAUGH

We gotta find him

RIGGS
No dice First thing we gotta do
is get you to a hospital

MURTAUGH
Uh-huh First thing we gotta do
is check on my house
(beat)
I got a bad feeling

He moves away Riggs starts to follow Goes to toss his
cigarette in the gutter and stops There is a tiny red
mark at the tip of the filter It is the cigarette The
very last one He stares at it a sudden glimmer in his
eye

CUT TO

EXT MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT 158

The Christmas lights shed a happy glow The lawn is
still littered with toys Two uniformed COPS are watch-
ing over the house sitting in a police car across the
street One of them munches on a sandwich The other
is doing a crossword puzzle A car pulls up next to
them The door opens -- out steps Mr Joshua

POLICE OFFICER
Excuse me sir may I see some
ID

Joshua takes an UZI from beneath his coat No hesi-
tation BLOWS them apart Walks forward gun smoking
Crosses the lawn to the front door Kicks it to

splinters

EXT CITY STREET - SAME TIME 159

A police CAR PEELS around the corner Takes out a
Salvation Army BUCKET which POPS like a clay duck
Coins shower every which way

INT CAR 160

Murtaugh is driving like a lunatic Beside him Riggs
holds a handkerchief to his gunshot wound

INT MURTAUGH HOME- SAME TIME 161

Joshua stalks down the hallway of Murtaughs house

Stops in front of the bedroom door Holy Jesus He
kicks it open SPPAYS the interior with GUNFIRE Shreds
the mattress dices the pillows Trashes everything in
sight Star Wars posters Stuffed animals Stereo

Empties an entire clip of 9 millimeter slugs Except

the bed is empty There is no one there Joshua snarls
Turns

SERIES OF SHOTS 162

Kicks open another door TRIGGERS DESTRUCTION Plaster

and wood fill the air in a cloud Room to room Search-
ing Growing more and more enraged -- because there is
no one here to kill He is blowing the shit out of an
empty Santa Monica bungalow He bursts into the only

room he hasnt visited Living room It too is empty
There is a note however Taped to the Christmas tree
Big letters

DEAR BADGUYS

NO ONE HERE BUT US COPS
SORRY

-- THE GOODGUYS

Joshua swears Runs for the door And a police CAR
drives through the front of the house PLOWS into the
living room shearing boards in half BURSTING WINDOWS
GRINDING to a hal- in a sea of glass Joshua spins
triggering the UZI- STRAFES the car A withering FIRE

Empties an entire clip at the front WINDSHIELD dicing
it to SMITHEREENS Waves the gun like a WAND STRAFING
X patterns FIRING all the while completely EXTINGUISH-
ING the car and all life within Stops Silence

Floating debris Joshua lowers the gun Breathing hard

Crosses the room his boots crunching through broken
glass Yanks on the drivers door It falls loose with
a metal clang

163 ANOTHER ANGLE 163

A cops nightstick has been jammed against the accel-
erator pedal The car is empty

Joshua spins startled
Stares across the room

At MARTIN RIGGS who sits calmly on the windowsill

RIGGS
Ho ho ho

He raises his gun and fires without blinking
Blows the gun out of Joshuas hands
Smiles a big shit-eating grin

Joshua turns and dives through the hole in the wall
Lands outside comes up running but sorry no dice
because there stands Roger Murtaugh Drawing a bead on
Joshuas running figure

MURTAUGH
Freeze Joshua

Joshua stops dead Turns growling low in his throat
A fire hydrant sheared off by the runaway car sprays
water high into the nighttime air The wind blows
Martin Riggs steps out of the house Pointing the 38
Special like a finger of doom Strolls toward Mr
Joshua the gun is rock steady Riggs eyes meet
Murtaughs and he speaks with deadly purpose

RIGGS
Ill handle it

He steps up to Joshua Smiles And then he does some-
thing very strange he relaxes his grip on the gun --
And throws it away Faces Joshua Raises his arms and
carefully places them behind his head When he speaks
his voice drips menace

RIGGS
Come on ace
(beat)
Try me

A moment Then Joshua calmly plants himself in front of
Riggs Around them water showers down in a gentle cloud
SIRENS APPROACH in the near distance Joshua and Riggs
Two soldiers Their eyes lock And you better hang onto
your popcorn boys and girls because its about to get

ugly

JOSHUA
Dont mind if I do

And so it begins They start to circle

Riggs and Joshua perfect concentration round and round
and never never once does their focus break because
baby these guys are pros -- And heres something funny
they arent looking at each others eyes at all Rather
-- Theyre watching each others hands

RIGGS

His fingers twitch Flex Wrist making slow laborious-
circles

JOSHUA
Shifting from leg to leg floating his balance
MURTAUGH

looks on sweating it out Hes not happy he wants to
end it And yet he waits

RIGGS AND JOSHUA

All we see is their eyes straining focusing scanning
for an opening

JOSHUA
Concentrate Martin Dont give
me an opening Wouldnt want to
do that

Riggs shifts Blinks And

JOSHUA

springs Foot coming out like a shot Riggs jerking
back inches -- meanwhile Riggs countermove spins
tries a back kick no dice Joshua no longer there
where is he Shit -- Comes up darts a punch

CRACK The sound of Riggs rib breaking carries clearly
He grunts Thrusts inviting a countermove Joshua
counters -- And Riggs snags his hand picture-fucking-

perfect Breaks one of Joshuas fingers Ouch Backs
off Joshua backs off The two of them Wounded they
circle Round two

MURTAUGH

Meanwhile is raising his gun pointing it at Joshua
Riggs voice cuts like a knife

RIGGS
No Roger
(beat)
No way

Murtaugh lowers the gun Stares fascinated at this
contest between two consummate professionals In for the
kill It is a dance of the forces Riggs is on fire
Leaps avoiding a shot to the knee spins slams the
knuckles of his hand into Joshuas nose Busts it

Joshua snarls drops -- Catches Riggs arm over one
shoulder And ladies and gentlemen Riggs has just
fucked up CRACK -- His arm breaks He screams with

pain Screams with anger Tosses three shots at Joshua
SNAP SNAP SNAP RIBS SPLINTERING Joshua hissing
with pain Lets go Back off (Riggs) Back off (Joshua)
In pain they circle Round three

JOSHUA
Thats it Martin your body
wants to go into shock but you
wont let it will you

RIGGS
- Give it up Your breathings
shot

JOSHUA

sos your left arm

RIGGS
Lifes tough that way Oh by
the way Fuck you

He launches himself at Joshua Joshua strikes scores a
minor point breaking Riggs collarbone except Riggs

doesnt care nosirree Bob ‘Cause he just hit paydirt
Joshuas knee Boot-strikes BAM -- Shearing the
knee maybe bursting the cap Joshua shrieks but then

again so would you And he promptly jack-knives his
fist right into Riggs broken arm Three times Riggs
bellows Refuses to quit

Slams his head into Joshuas busted nose Pop

Does it again Joshua hammering the broken arm Pow
(Scream) Pow (Scream) Until son of a bitch The
pain is simply too intense nothing human can withstand
it they fall away staggering wrenching to a shaky halt

facing one another standoff Exhausted limping hardly

able to speak

POLICE CARS 170

Pulling up now cops stumbling out guns clearing their
holsters as Murtaugh waves frantically screams

MURTAUGH
No guns Let it go Goddammit
let it go
RIGGS 171

spits gazes straight at Joshua Joshua stares back
Two soldiers This close to collapsing Until breaking

the silence -- comes Murtaughs voice
MURTAUGH
Martin
RIGGS
Yeah
MURTAUGH

The motherfucker

A moment and then my friends Riggs does a peculiar
thing He smiles then Damned if he doesnt And rises
up Standing Standing straight There is no way he
should be able to do this And then he speaks and its
like the voice of doom and all of a sudden we know that
this guy is a fucking legend we know why the VC en-
forcers whispered his name at night in the foxholes
He is Riggs And no one can touch him No one

RIGGS
Last chance Walk away

JOSHUA
Fuck yourself

RIGGS
Fine Die

He steps forward Stands Joshua springs -- thunders
his foot into Riggs hip separating the bone at the
joint And Riggs doesnt blink His hand comes out

Lightning quick

There is a sick-sounding CRACK -- And Joshua is dead
before he hits the ground Riggs hovers over the
corpse breathing spastic saliva dripping from his

lips takes a handkerchief wipes his hand and says

RIGGS
You lose

At which point he collapses like a sack of grain
172 MURTAUGH 172

is running forward tears in his eyes by this time falls
to his knees cradling Riggs in his arms while the
assembled cops look on in thoroughly stunned silence
what they have just seen is beyond their wildest
imagining

173 ON GROUND 173
Riggs looks at Murtaugh Murtaugh looks at Riggs

MURTAUGH

RIGGS

He chuckles Groans Passes out The water RAINS
steadily down The night wears on

Punk who Riggs beat the shit out of at the very beginning
of the film

PUNK

on the sidewalk semi-conscious Murtaugh scowls and
says

RAIN pours down Martin Riggs stands over a lone grave
There are dark hollows under his eyes The wind tugs at
his hair The tombstone reads

green Christmas wreath which he places atop the grave
Kisses his fingertips Presses them to the moist earth

Until Roger Murtaugh appears from inside the boat on the
trailer hitch

He stands on deck and looks down at Riggs
