DAWN OF
THE DEAD

(The working draft 1977)
by George A Romero

speak

time

We see the face of a young woman She is asleep It is very
quiet at first as credits appear The womans face begins to
twitch as though she is having a bad dream She moans slightly
and her expression grows more desperate

A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in As they get louder we
can discern what sounds like a busy office area It is actually
a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
emergency

The womans moans get louder and more desperate as the
background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop The
woman sits up snapping awake

She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man She
Francine twenty three years old and very attractive although

she is gritty with dirt Her hair is hanging dishevelled and
sweaty Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days

She is sitting on the floor where she has slept the last
several hours covered by an old overcoat

Tony YOU OK

Fran stares at the young man She is shaking She doesnt

Tony THE SHITS REALLY HITTING THE FAN

The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
where others sleep on the floor He wakes them up one at a

We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio They
have an electronic tinniness as broadcast over a monitor Fran
looks about She is still shaken from her dream

We see the television studio Reporters buzz about madly
Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted Technicians man
monitors and we see people on the little screens arguing
emotionally

Voice WHATS MAKING IT HAPPEN WHAT THE HELL
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHATS MAKING IT
HAPPEN
Voice YES BUT THATS
Voice THATS A WHOLE OTHER STUDY THEYRE TRYING
Voice BUT IF WE KNEW THAT WE COULD

Voice WE DONT KNOW THAT WE DONT KNOW THAT
WEVE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW

5 The room is pandemonium People run in with wire copy others
organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive Others trip
over cables and generally get in each others way

6 Francine stares at the madness still trying to clear her head

Mans voice IM STILL DREAMING

Fran turns her head Another young man sits next to her on the
floor He is one of the ones Tony awakened

Fran NO YOURE NOT
Woman MY TURN WITH THE COAT

Fran looks up A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
cup She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours

sleep
Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet
Woman THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY
A BUNCH OF EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY
I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WELL BE ABLE
TO STAY ON AIR
7 Fran staggers over to the control consoles The technicians are

at the end of their ropes

Technicians (all at once)
WATCH CAMERA TWOWHO THE HELLS ON CAMERA
TWO A BLIND MAN
WATCH THE FRAMEWATCH THE FRAME
ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN

Technicians WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT
SO GET ME A NEW LIST
SURE ILL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS

Fran focuses on the monitors She is incredulous stunned by

the madness which surrounds her She realises the hopelessness

of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised
conversation
8 We begin to listen over the din of the news room

TV Man 1 I DONT BELIEVE THAT DOCTOR AND I DONT
BELIEVE

TV Man 2 DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
LIFE

TV Man 1 IM NOT SO

TV Man 2 DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING

TV Man 1 IM NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR

9 Suddenly we cut into the studio and we see the argument as it

is being shot

TV Man 1 (cont)
ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US
AND ITS HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

TV Man 2 ITS FACT ITS FACT
TV Man 1 ITS HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU

COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND

TV Man 2 HUMAN DIG YOU CANT
TV Man 1 FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY
TV Man 2 YOURE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE MR

BERMAN YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR

TV Man 1 YOURE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
CODE OF BEHAVIOUR AND THERES A LOT OF US
WHO ARENT READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER

10 A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor Doctor
Foster is flustered and frustrated The stage hands and
cameramen are all screaming at him swearing and ridiculing We
notice Police guards armed at the studio doors They control
the traffic in and out of the big room

11 Back at the control panel Fran stares at the screens
Confusion

still reigns

Man FRANNIE GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS
CHARLIES RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES

Fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
on screen

12 She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie a
harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
unit under his chin

Charlie (into receiver)
SAY AGAINCANT HEAR YOU
Fran RESCUE STATIONS
Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlies desk He writes
notes as he listens on the receiver and he speaks to the
woman
Charlie HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE
IM TRYIN TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
IMMEDIATE AREA WEVE HAD OLD INFORMATION
ON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS
Fran THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS WE CANT SEND
PEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE
Charlie (into receiver)
SAY AGAIN NEW HOPE
Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran Still
listening
on the receiver he speaks to the woman again
Charlie IM DOIN WHAT I CAN THESE ARE DEFINITE
AS OF NOW SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO
TOO GOOD LUCK
Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room
13 She stops at the consoles
Fran IM GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS
ILL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN
Technician WERE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
CLOSED DOWN IM GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST
14 Fran moves toward another control room An armed officer stops

her A young man rushing through with copy intercedes

Man HEY SHES ALRIGHT
Officer WHERES YOUR BADGE

Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse Her
badge is missing

Fran JESUS
Man SHES ALRIGHT
Fran I HAD ITI WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE
She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep
Man SOMEBODY STOLE IT THERES A LOT OF EM
MISSING
(to officer)
SHES ALRIGHT LET HER THROUGH
The officer reluctantly steps aside
15 The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a
small
camera room The foot traffic is solid They talk as they walk
Fran I DONT BELIEVE IT
Man ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
OF DOORSYOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
YOU GOT A BADGEANY KIND OF BADGE
Fran ITS REALLY GOING CRAZY

16 They reach a small camera installation The camera is aimed at

machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations The list is
superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out

Cameraman YOU GOT NEW ONES

Fran I GOTTA TYPE EM UP KILL THE OLD ONES

Cameraman GIVENS WANT EM

Fran KILL EM DICK TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME

The man clicks off his camera Fran moves toward the studio
17 On the monitors we see the rescue stations blink off over
shots

of the two men who still argue on the air

TV Man 1 WELL I DONT BELIEVE IN GHOSTS DOCTOR
TV Man 2 THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS NOR ARE THESE HUMANS
THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
RE-ACTIVATE AND ITS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
LARGE

18 Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and

observers
Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries

TV Man 2 YOU HAVE NOT LISTENEDYOU HAVE NOT LISTENED
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKSWHAT DOES IT TAKE

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE

19 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
argue The commotion is maddening Fran stares for a moment

20 TV Man 2 (now distraughtalmost pleading)
THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE PEOPLE
MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT
ITS EXTREMELY DIFFICULTWITH FRIENDS
WITH FAMILYBUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
BODY

Another outburst in the studio

TV Man 2 THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLEDBEFORE ITS
TOO LATETHEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY

21 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
finally reaches another emergency radio installation Skip and
Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers They jot notes

Fran OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS

Dusty THEYRE DROPPIN LIKE FLIES HERES A FEW
YOU KNOW I THINK FOSTERS RIGHT I THINK
WERE LOSIN THIS WAR

Fran YEAH BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY
WERE BLOWIN IT OURSELVES

She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men

Fran NOT MUCH LEFT BUT HAVE A BALL
The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup Fran rushes
off toward a large teleprompter typing machine

22 The broadcasters still argue emotionally

TV Man 1 PEOPLE ARENT WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS
DOCTOR AND I FOR ONE DONT BLAME THEM

TV Man 2 EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
BECOMES ONE OF THEM IT GETS UP AND KILLS
THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL

23 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
typist Fran rushes back toward the control room

24 Around the monitor consoles the commotion has been made even
more frantic by an angered Dan Givens obviously one of the
station managers

Givens NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT I WANT
Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room

Givens GARRET WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS

Fran NOBODY I KILLED EM THEYRE OUT OF DATE

Givens I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME

Fran ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN

Givens WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
MINUTE PEOPLE WONT WATCH US THEYLL TUNE OUT

Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief

Givens I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE
THAT
WERE ON THE AIR
Fran is about to say something in anger but before she can
one

of the technicians having overheard Givens gets up from the
control panel and starts to walk away

Givens LUCASLUCAS WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
GET ON THAT CONSOLELUCASWERE ON THE AIR

Lucas ANYBODY NEED A RIDE

25 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
personal effects and follow the technician toward the door The
door is guarded by a nervous Officer

26 Givens OFFICEROFFICERYOU STOP THEMSTOP THOSE
MEN LUCASGET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE
A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control

People
rush in and out the floor directors voice can be heard over a
talk back system

Voices WHAT THE HELLS GOIN ON IN THERE
SWITCH SWITCHTHERES NO SWITCHER
WERE LOSING PICTURE

Givens OFFICERSTOP THOSE MEN

27 The young officer faces the men as they reach his post He

takes
a grip on his rifles opens the door and lets the group

through
Then he runs out himself deserting the losing cause

28 Givens jumps toward the console He frantically tries to work
the complex dials and pots

Givens GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
THIS THINGCOME ONILL TRIPLE THE MONEY
FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING TRIPLE
THE MONEYWERE STAYING ON THE AIR

Fran moves slowly off toward the studio

29 In the big room the tension is thicker than ever A few of

the
newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions
but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
the broadcast which still rages

30 TV Man 2 THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON

THEY KILL FOR FOOD
THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
MR BERMAN THATS WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING

31 Fran stops to listen to the argument She falls back into the
shadows of the studio People rush past her some leaving the
studio in disgust

32 TV Man 2 IF WED LISTENEDIF WED DEALT WITH THE

PHENOMENON PROPERLYWITHOUT EMOTION
WITHOUT EMOTION
IT WOULDNT HAVE COME TO THIS

Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief He pulls his
tie away from his tight collar and pops the shirt button open
He is desperate now shivering with anger and frustration

TV Man 2 THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
PHILADELPHIAAS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
THE COUNTRY

CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THEDIREDIRE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENONSHOULD WE

BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD

BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES OF THE
CITIZENRYTOWARDTHESE ISSUES OF
MORALITY

IT IS THE ORDER OF THE OEP BY COMMAND OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE

UNITED STATES

CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES
NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED

A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
crescendo Foster tries to talk over the noise

TV Man 2 CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
THE CITY

Technicians abandon their posts A few others jump in to take
their places but pandemonium reigns A cameraman whips off his
headset and breaks for the door His camera spins on its liquid
head and on the monitors we see a whirling blur as Foster
continues to speak

Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera She aims it back at
the sweating Foster and she stares through the viewfinder not
believing what she is seeing

TV Man 2 THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER

TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION

Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
quickly behind Fran

Steve FRANNIEAT NINE OCLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF
WERE GETTING OUT

Fran (letting the camera slip slightly)
STEPHENI DONT BELIEVE THISWHAT

Steve WERE GETTING OUT IN THE CHOPPER

Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran

quiet

Stephen talks more quietly in the other mans presence
Steve NINE PM ALRIGHT
Fran STEVEWE CANTWEVE GOT TO

Steve WEVE GOT TO NOTHING FRAN WEVE GOT TO
SURVIVE SOMEBODYS GOT TO SURVIVE NOW YOU
COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE DONT MAKE ME COME
LOOKIN FOR YA

Stephen is gone in a flash Fran nervously looks back at the
cameraman The argument still rages between Foster and Berman
The cameraman without taking his eye from the viewfinder
speaks to Francine quietly and slowly

Cameraman GO AHEAD WELL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
ANYWAY EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER
OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS FINISHED IM AFRAID

It is dusk and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly
We see several large buildings They are part of a low-income

housing project and their lack of grace is evident They stand
like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky

Under cover of the growing darkness activities of the

SWAT

court

Unit go unnoticed Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building
Men in armour vests clutching the latest in special weapons
take position here and there about the development

Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the
below

On the roof at an entrance to one of the buildings fire
stairs Roger squats silently alongside three other team
members The men check their weapons Roger looks at his watch
The sweep hand reaches the 12

Roger (to himself) LIGHTS

In an instant large searchlights bathe the side of the

building The troop commander shielded with other Officers

behind a large truck shouts through an electric bullhorn

Commander MARTINEZYOUVE BEEN WATCHINGYOU KNOW WE
HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED

The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
caverns between the buildings of the project There are only a
few windows which glow with lights from inside At the sound of
the bullhorn the lights all blink out one at a time

Commander (not over the bullhorn)
LITTLE BASTARDS GOT EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
BUILDING DUMB LITTLE BASTARD
Sergeant LOOKS LIKE THEYRE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US
Commander (on the bullhorn again)
MARTINEZTHE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
RESPONSIBILITYWE DONT WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
AND NEITHER DO YOU

42 There is no sign of life in the building The great concrete
slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky

43 Roger and his team mates crouch in readiness The sound of
the
bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly
Roger IM GIVIN YOU THREE MINUTES MARTINEZ
Commander (Bullhorn)
IM GIVIN YOU THREE MINUTES MARTINEZ
TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER
Roger THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU

Commander THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
PEOPLE

Roger YET
Commander THREE MINUTES MARTINEZ

Roger AND COUNTING
(he looks at his watch)

There is a long silence

Roger COME ON MARTINEZ

One of the other SWAT team members is a big man witha
rough and vicious looking face He is WOOLEY a hardened

veteran and a red neck of the first order

Wooley YEAH COME ON MARTINEZSHOW YOUR GREASY
LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASSSO I CAN BLOW IT OFF
Roger looks over at the big man He is distressed at the pent

up
violence in Wooley
Wooley ILL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFFLOW LIFE
BASTARDS
BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF
Roger is greatly concerned He looks at one of the other men a
young smoothed faced rookie The boy doesnt know now to
react
He is obviously nervous
Roger KEEP COOL JUST DONT POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
GO IN
The boy nods grateful for a more human contact
Wooley HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY SHIT
MAN THIS BETTER THAN I GOT YOU AINT
GONNA TALK EM OUTA HERE YOU GOTTA BLOW
EM OUT BLOW THEIR ASSES
Roger (to the boy)
YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT
The boy nods in the affirmative
Wooley LETS GET ON WITH IT THIS IS A WASTE OF
MY TIME
44 CRASH Without warning the metal door to the fire stair
bursts
open and several figures rush out of the darkness Shots are
fired from hand guns A bullet smashes through the skull of the
young boy next to Roger He falls against Roger with a pleading
expression on his face
Figures charge this way and that More gunfire The other
SWAT men dodge and dive for cover Wooley opens fire with
his automatic weapon
45 On the street the Commander hearing the gunfire barks into

the bullhorn

Commander MOVE INMOVE IN
GODDAMMIT
Sergeant (into walkie talkie)

ALL UNITS FULL OPERATION

young

On the roof Roger struggles under the dead weight of the
man He tries to free himself and his weapons Shots ring out

A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
rooftop Another SWAT patrol appears from behind a large
elevator housing The young civilians retreat Several are

down

Another bullet smashes against the dead SWAT mans back
Just as Roger frees himself a bullet catches him squarely in
the chest but his armour takes the impact He is thrown back
off balance and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
top

Before he reaches the gun he is cut off by the looming figure
of one of the Black youths pistol in hand Roger freezes The
young man aims his hand gun but hesitates A sudden barrage of
bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
blood It was Wooleys gun that killed him

Wooley COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS
COME AND GET EM

He fires again and again even though the skirmish is winding
down

Roger charges for his weapon snatches it up and runs for the
cover of an incinerator housing He startles a young civilian
who was hiding there trying to load his gun The boy makes a
break

Roger HOLD IT

The boy freezes for a moment then thinking breaks into a run
across the roof

Roger HOLD IT KIDDONT RUN OUT THERE
The boy is mowed down in a crossfire

Inside the building other SWAT teams along with units of
the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
into apartment units People are herded into the halls where
they are held at gun point

Some men although armed surrender willingly Others retaliate
against the invading force and little skirmishes develop on
every floor of the complex structure

On the ground the Commander barks into the bullhorn
Commander MASKS

Sergeant (into walkie talkie)
MASKS FOR GASMASKS FOR GAS

Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
filled with clouds of gas Civilians trying to escape are
choked as they attempt to shoot their way out

The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
building

SWAT 1 WORK YOUR WAY DOWN A FLOOR AT A TIME
HOLD EM IN THE HALLS TIL WE CAN WORK EM
DOWN THE STAIRS

Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit snap on their
bizarre looking gas masks

The troopers break into an apartment on the floor An old

kneels in prayer at a small alter while their children and
their childrens children huddle in a corner The young husband
surrenders his gun to a trooper and Roger watches as the group
is led into the hallway

Suddenly a young Black man charges out of one of the
apartments A woman appears at the door screaming for him to
stop He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
automatic The black man crashes to the floor Wooley is

He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
into the room

The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
hall The younger ones try to escape while the older people
kneel or fall against the walls praying

SWAT 2 WOOLEYS GONE APE SHIT MAN

Roger WOOLEY (shouting)

Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment Roger charges at
him and grabs him around the shoulders The big man resists

gun fires and bullets fly wildly He struggles against Roger
but Roger manages to hold on

Roger GIMME A HANDSOMEBODY

Another SWAT Trooper steps up
very tall and he looks mysterious
deep voice

Trooper STEP AWAY FROM HIM

Roger GIMME A HAND

Wooley throws his body around and
but Roger grabs him again just as
off his gun at the open apartment

out of the cloud of gas He

in the fog as he speaks ina

slams Roger against the wall
the crazed man is levelling
door

Roger GODDAMMITHELP MEHES CRAZY

Trooper STEP AWAY FROM HIM
Just then Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
hallway The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one

shot through Wooleys head The big man falls back violently

The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall
Other SWAT Officers face him threateningly He stares at
them through his mask They let him pass He disappears through
the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
civilians

Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones Roger is
helped

to his feet by another Officer Rogers eyes are wide and

staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask They are

locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment

which Wooley kicked open The other Trooper looks and his eyes

widen as well
53 In the apartment lying in a pool of blood are the partial
remains of what was a human body It has been ripped to shreds

The other trooper moves
one leg missing one

Roger staggers against the door frame

inside Another corpse also mutilated
arm

badly mangled It is trying to move To reach the Troopers
54 A sudden loud scream Roger startles and spins around A woman
in the hall has seen the grisly sight and she runs screaming
down the corridor More confusion as civilians push through
the

Troopers who try to hold them back

55 The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed
the

Trooper JESUSHOLY JESUS

A third officer enters the apartment He speaks to the Trooper
which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor

Trooper 2 SHOOT ITSHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD
The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
Officer pulls out his pistol Then suddenly from out of the
shadows a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer
flailing and biting at his arms It is a wild-haired woman
here are several bleeding wounds over her body She is one of
the walking dead

immediately and attacks again The third Troopers rifle

A slug tears through the womans chest but it doesnt stop her

He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which

Voice YOURE NOT ALONE BROTHER
Roger tightens grabbing for his gun The voice is present

nearby Roger looks up Sitting on the stairs above is the
Trooper who shot Wooley His rifle is aimed at Roger

Voice YOU WAS IN WOOLEYS UNIT

Roger I DIDNT SEE NOTHIN

Roger slings his rifle so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
gun He removes his gas mask He is Black

Roger YOU RUNNIN
The Black man shrugs He hasnt decided

Roger I DONT JUST MEAN CAUSE OF WOOLEY

Voice YEAH I KNOW

Roger THERES A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN

Roger I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT

The black man just stares levelly into Rogers eyes

Roger FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER HE DOES
TRAFFIC FOR JAS GOT A HELICOPTER AND HES

The Black man smiles

Roger YOU THINK ITS RIGHT TO RUN

The Black man shrugs again then he stands and walks down the

stairs HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down

into the lingering gas mist Roger follows

A few landings downa noise The two Troopers freeze The
stairwell is dark The noise grows louder The Troopers ready

their weapons
The sounds are little scraping thumps like the weary foot

of someonesomethingtrying to negotiate the stairsThere
is the low wheezing sound of laboured breath

The men stare at the landing below The Black man steps forward
slightly trying not to make a sound

Suddenly a figure pops out of the darkness It falls against
the wall below Both Troopers raise their guns The figure

away from the wall In the mist its shape is ghostly
robedin blackis sees the Troopers

Figure SENORES
PLEASE TO LET ME PASS

The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough The figure slumps
and sits on the steps clinging to the railing It is an old
Priest obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish

Roger stoops next to the old man who is struggling to keep his
breath He is weary He seems to be near death He clutches at
his chest
Roger tries to support him
Roger LETS GET HIM TO THE MEDICS

The Priest goes into a coughing fit The Troopers look on
wants to help in some way

Priest MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
WEEKSIN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING

The Troopers are shocked The Priest struggles to his feet

Priest I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES
NOW YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL

The old man starts up the stairs Roger moves to help him but
the big Black man stops him The Priest weaves up through the
gas mist coughing

Priest YOU ARE STRONGER THAN USBUT SOON I
THINKTHEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU

The old mans voice trails off up the stairwell as he

disappears

Priest WHEN THE DEAD WALK SENORESWE MUST
STOP THE KILLINGOR WE LOSE THE WAR

In the basement of the large building SWAT troopers pry

the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
area

The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready weapons
raisedhigh powered riflesflame throwers

The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free The men are
silent not knowing what to expect

There are three boards leftthen two

With a great tearing sound the door flies open before the men
remove the last boards The boards fly and the door almost rips
off its hinges Like flood waters a small army of Zombies
pushes into the hall

They are wide eyed and terrifying In life they were mostly
Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings They
are all ages from the very old to the very young

The riot troops are stunned They cannot react quickly enough
and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
impossible to shoot accurately or without the bullets injuring
other troopers
mass

into

him

The men fight back wrestling and trying to back away In the
front line Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans Teeth tear
into arms and hands Some men are trampled in the crush

Commander BACK OFFBACK OFFSPREAD OUT
The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule and as the

of struggling bodies spreads out shots begin to fire Some
Troopers at close quarters are able to fire off accurate
rounds with their hand guns Others fall and are lunged at by
clutching ghouls

Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle
They fight off several of the creatures The battle spreads

little skirmishes through the dark hallways The highly
organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
onslaught

As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
area several Troopers move into the room

The walls are dank and grey There is a dripping sound All
around lie remnants of human civilisation Baby buggies and
bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area Large trunks and
cartons of every size and shape old beds and other furniture

And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
corpses They have been eaten away Most of them are still
moving their heads uninjured

Two of the Troopers retreat revulsed The sound of the gunfire
and screaming can be heard from the hall

The big Black man walks calmly into the room Roger watches

He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time and fires
carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun Tears
roll down his cheeks

Some of the creatures are without arms and legs Some have been
eaten away about the neck and shoulder They moan with a
gurgling gutteral sound as they try to move

A young Black Zombie pulling itself along the floor with one
arm draws close to the Black Trooper The big man aims his
pistol It clicksempty He quickly and efficiently reaches
for more ammunition and begins to reload The Zombie pulls
closer its mouth wide

Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the

who

The

creatures head with his automatic rifle

The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
the pistol

Roger disposes of several other creatures he comes to a place
where several are piled together Some lie still others writhe
about Two on the heap although they cannot move about are
eating at parts of other bodies Roger shoots them They never
look up They dont seem to notice him at all

A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly Roger looks up

In the ceiling a double set of loading doors has been opened
Several other Troopers look down into the storage area

Trooper JESUS CHRIST

He shines a light beam down towards Roger

Trooper YOU OK DOWN THERE

Roger nods

Trooper THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED EM IN

Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening
Trooper YOU NEED MORE MEN

Roger shakes his head no

Trooper JESUS CHRIST

The trooper leaves the opening He is replaced by two others

just stare down into the storage room through the weird round
lenses of their masks

The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again

big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
few steps forwards He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
tied securely with clothes line It looks like a mummy It is

writhing trying to free itself he shoots it through the head

Nearby a small corpse that of a very young child is also
writhing but the end of the shroud where the childs feet
should be has been torn open and is bloody A stump kicks
around the blood where a foot has been eaten off The Black man
fires into the things head

The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie

In the halls of the building Troopers fall and are pounced on
by ghouls Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
heads of attacking Zombies The riot troops try to stay
organised but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
is turning into a riot

The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight What few
lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware

It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and
occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against
another

There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina
They bob about silently The chain which normally restricted
the area is broken and dangling The sign which reads CITY

PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
chain in the wind

Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house Inside
sitting at a radio transmitter is the corpse of a uniformed
guard

Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
square pattern It is a landing bay for Police helicopters
Alongside afloat separately but securely chained fast is a
small fuel barge with pumps and hoses for refueling the

chopper

we

and launches

The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks another
officer and a civilian A bell buoy rings in the distance and

begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter

the

The blades of the JAS Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
for a landing The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
gently bobbing heliport

With the blades still spinning loudly Stephen hops out of the
cockpit

Steve COME ONI NEED YOU

Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
the machine Steve runs ducking under the blades around to

womans side of the cockpit grabs her hand and they make for
the fuel pumps

Steve I DONT SEE ROGER WELL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES
Fran OH MY GOD

The woman freezes in mid stride and her action brings

Stephens

eyes around to see what she is staring at The two bodies which
lie near the fuel pumps

Steve YOU HAVENT BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL
ITS TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT

He pulls her quickly along They have to actually step over the
civilian corpse Fran freezes again She cant bring herself to
walk over the body Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
tank gauge he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
to Fran The long hose is heavy and it bobbles the civilian
corpse almost rolling it over The back of the bodies head has
been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet Blood
still runs The wound is fresh Steve does not see this as he
tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
Fran following

At the side of the machine the blades still spinning

overhead

Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle He
pulls one of Frans hands into the nozzle mechanism

Steve JUST LIKE THISLIKE A CAR
Fran responds getting the feel of the nozzle trigger

Steve THATS ITJUST HOLD HER THERE TIL SHE
SPITS OUT AT YA

The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
shed The propeller blades still spin They make an eerie
the

docks

She

and

He

the

of

whispering sound as they pass over Frans head She can hear
lapping water now and the creaking moans of the shifting
She looks this way and that fear in her eyes

At the guard house Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
operator A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code
The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
key A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
dead mans head As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
posture in its chair he sees that the exit of the bullet all
but obliterated the corpses face Again the wound is still
running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
desk and the radio unit

Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
a message in Morse

OPERATOR DEADPOST ABANDONED
Back on the fuel dock the long hose brushes over the civilian
corpse A shadow moves nearby making is aware of a presence

other than Frans

The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle The blades still
whoosh overhead Then she hears the sound of another engine

looks towards the mainland The headlights of an approaching
vehicle can be seen

At the guard house Stephen hearing the approaching engine
steps into the doorway and looks up the dock He calls to Fran

Steve I HOPE ITS ROGER

Fran WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Steve ILL BE RIGHT THERE

He ducks back into the shed He snatches up a First Aid Kit
throws it into a khaki knapsack He rummages in the darkness
finds a toolbox

As he stands up he backs into a tall figure which stands in
shadows Feeling something sharp and hard against his back

Steve recoils and spins to face the figure It is a uniformed
officer His rifle is levelled off at Steves chest From out

the shadows a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
and aimed

Frans eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle but
suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision
Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble she notices a
Police van It has been there all along its doors flung wide
open as though abandoned hurriedly Now one of the rear doors
move A figure appears carrying a large packing carton The
figure is uniformed with two rifles strapped to its back It
rushes toward the launch docks

Voice JUST STAY COOL

Fran already startled by the running figure is now doubly
shocked by the calm voice behind her She spins and the fuel
nozzle clatters out of its receptacle to the wooden dock
boards She is facing another Policeman to aims a rifle
directly at her head

Officer 1 IF YOU DIEITLL BE YOUR OWN FAULT

The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
Guard House

Officer 2 COME ON SKIPPERTHEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN

In the Guard House Steve is held at bay by one of the

Officers

while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
progress of the approaching vehicles

Officer 3 WHO ARE YOU
Steve WERE WITH JASWE

Officer 4 (at the door)
ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF
(referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

Officer 3 the Skipper pushes Steve with his gun barrel Steve
spins out through the open doorway He looks up the dock and
sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
almost a mile long

Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
helicopter bubble pulling out Steves rifle

Steve NOW WAIT A MINUTEWERE JUST HERE TO REFUEL
THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEADYOU WERE HERE
YOU KNOW THATIT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
AFTER THE LAUNCHESWE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

Officer 3 (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)

Steve (trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
RIGHTTHATS MEIM STEVE ANDREW

Officer 3 NO SHIT

Officer 1 (shouting from the helicopter)
WED GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD SKIPPER

Steve freezes again sensing that these are not law enforcers

The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches

Officer 2 CANT ALL FIT

Officer 3 (directly to Stephen)
HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD

Officer 4 HEY MAN I AINT GOIN NOWHERE IN NOTHIN I

Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
carton rushing back to the launch

Officer 2 THATS TRUESOMETHIN HAPPENS TO HIM AND
WERE STUCK STAY WITH THE LAUNCH

Officer 1 GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD

Suddenly above the two white headlights of the approaching
vehicle we see a third light in red It is the spinning
bubble-gum-machine of a Squad Car It is heralded by one
blast of the cars siren

Officer 4 HEY THATS A BLACK AND WHITE

Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran

Officer 1 THEY SEEN US

Officer 3 ITS ALRIGHTWERE POLICE

Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls
rifle from his back

Officer 2 BULL SHITLETS GET TO THE BOAT

answer

Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen Then at the Squad Car Then
back at the nervous young pilot

Officer 3 YOURE RUNNIN AINT YOU FLY BOY
Steve does not respond He is terrified not knowing what
to be the safest

Officer 3 YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN OFF IN THE
JAS TRAFFIC BIRD

The man starts to grin with knowing He suddenly feels in more
control

Officer 3 SIT TIGHT BOYSTHEYRE RUNIN TOO

It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
dock Stephen takes a few steps forward squinting to see but
he is threatened by the Policemans gun barrels

The car screeches to a stop and two armed SWAT Troopers
immediately pop out of the front seat on either side They are
Roger and the Black Trooper

Roger WHATS THE PROBLEM OFFICER

Officer 3 CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN COMPANY
GASOLINE
Roger WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS

Roger is trying to play dumb assuming that the other Policemen
are on official business

Steve THEY KNOW ROG

Officer 3 ITD BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN AT ONE

He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran She
bobbles it and it falls skittering across the dock

Officer 1 YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING WOMAN

full of supplies The woman falls into his arms Roger trots
Roger YOU OK
Stephen (nods)

Roger HIS NAMES PETER HES ALRIGHT
The three are already moving toward the helicopter
Roger LETS HUSTLE
Peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit and

has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock He tries the

in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
fills

The other Policemen are still moving cartons of supplies from
their van down the dock

Roger (to the other Policemen)
YOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT THERES A RADIO
REPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN KNOCKED OUT
They reach the cockpit Fran climbs in and crouches on the
in the rear of the bubble
Fran YOU SURE THISLL CARRY US ALL

Steve LITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL BUT WELL BE OK

As Peter climbs aboard one of the other policemen carrying a
final carton speaks to Roger

Officer 2 HEYYOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES

Roger looks at the others one at a time Fran shakes her head

no
Roger SORRY (he trots around to the passenger seat)
Steve WHERE YA HEADED

Officer 2 DOWN RIVERGOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO

Steve WHAT ISLANDS (he starts the engine)

Officer 2 ANY ISLANDSWHAT ABOUT YOU WHERE YOU HEADED

Steve STRAIGHT UP
106 The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts As they untie
one

of the launches from the dock the JAS helicopter whines
loudly Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion

The Police launch starts without a problem and it pulls out
onto the dark river

107 The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
over the Philadelphia skyline We see an empty city
ndependence HallBetsy Ross House which flies the original
American flagthe oldest American heritages stand coldly in
the night The whirring engine fades overhead

108 n the cockpit Fran lights a cigarette So does Roger No one
comments but Peter smiles slightly

The big Black looks down at the city

Peter ANY OF YOU LEAVIN PEOPLE BEHIND
Fran AN EX-HUSBAND

Roger AN EX-WIFE

Steve YOU PETER

Peter (still looking down)
SOME BROTHERS

109 The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky It flies over
open country now moving West Some time has passed

110 Roger is asleep in the passenger seat Twisted in the cramped
rear of the cockpit Fran and Peter sit very close to each
other Peter still stares off into the night

Fran REAL BROTHERS
Peter looks at her He has a strong face
Fran REAL BROTHERS ORSTREET BROTHERS
Peter BOTH

Fran HOW MANY REAL ONES

Peter TWO

Fran TWO

Peter ONES IN JAIL THE OTHERS A PRO BALL PLAYER
BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE

Fran doesnt quite know how to respond

Peter (nodding at Stevethe engine roars too loudly
for the pilot to hear the conversation)
HE YOUR MAN NOW

Fran is taken off guard She smiles slightly

Fran MOST OF THE TIME YEAH

Peter JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS

Fran YEAH ME TOO

111 Light downs on the horizon The little helicopter chugs through
the shades of blue

112 Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores Peter stares at the
back of the pilots head Steve nods slightly then shakes
himself Soon he nods againfalling asleep Peter kicks him
in the shoulder

Steve looks back surprised that the big man is awake Peter
just stares at him

Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand He pulls at
his lower eyelids

Steve ANY MORE WATER

Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic
container

with water Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his

face Then he passes it back to Peter who also drinks

Suddenly Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start Peter looks

Search

over at her with a gentle expression She takes a moment to
orient herself

Peter (to Stephen)
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

Steve I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE

Peter HARRISBURG

Steve PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO

Roger finally wakes up from the loud talking

Steve WERE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL IM JUST WAITIN
FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WERE
LANDIN IN

In the morning light several fires can be seen on the ground
where buildings are burning

The chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
winding country road

Here and there on the ground human activity can be seen

and Destroy units made up of Police Guardsmen and civilian
volunteers move across the country side Occasionally a Zombie
is seen staggering through the trees or over a field Gunfire
cuts the creature down

Roger JESUS ITS EVERYWHERE

Steve WERE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN WERE
BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES

A little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun There
is no sign of life A few private planes dot the area but the
tower is empty The JAS chopper buzzes very low just outside
the tower windows

As the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps its
blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
from the dry earth Sheets of old newspaper and other light
debris are sent flying through the air in all directions

One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
of the little sheds It sticks against the glass for a moment
as though glued there then it flutters to the ground As the
paper clears the glass we see the face of a badly scarred
Zombie peering out through the window

the

small

long

closed

As the group scrambles out of the helicopter Stephen
immediately checks the fuel pumps

Steve SHIT MAN DAMN NEAR EMPTY

Roger LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS
GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF

Steve TO WHERE WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO
Peter WHERE WE GOIN
By now Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into

choppers tank and moved to the second pump It spurts with
more force

Steve THERES A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP

He stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesnt quite
reach

Steve DAMN I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER

Steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
ground

Fran is watching the action walking slowly backwards to a

rickety hangar area She turns and looks down to the private
hangars Most of them are open wide the planes they housed

gone One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still

and locked with chains and padlocks The wind from the chopper
blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying

Peter kicks open the door to the chart house The room is dusty
and dilapidated A few small chairs surround an old wooden
table Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper Flies
buzz loudly An old window shade clicks against its window from
the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch

He readies his weapon When he sees the shade he steps over to
it easily pulls it and lets it roll up on itself It makes a
loud flapping noise

Outside the chopper sets down Roger is ready with the hose
nozzle Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine

they

Stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
noise

Steve IM GONNA SEE WHATS LEFT IN THE HANGARS
He trots off after Fran

In the chart house Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
machine at one end of the room The machine clicks loudly and
spits out a cup To Peters surprise the cup starts to fill
with hot brown liquid

While he waits Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
machine and the surrounding walls They are all written
hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and
colours

LUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN
CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS LEFT WITH BEN
COULDNT WAIT GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER

There are dozens of such messages Peter takes the full coffee
cup from the machine As he sips it his eyes fall on a closet
door just across the room It is moving slightly It is locked
but it bangs against the lockoncetwicemore regularly
than if caused by the wind drafts

Peter steps closer Now the door bangs violently with a loud
crash but it holds Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
and takes his rifle in both hands

Again the door bangs hard and a skeleton key is knocked out of
the keyhole It falls to the floor with a metallic clang and
Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
of the closet under the door and onto the linoleum

Another bang and a gurgling moan One of the living dead is
trying to break out of the closet

Quite calmly Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
about head high The rifle roars in the little room and a
splintery hole appears in the old wooden door

Outside Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
rifle Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
hangars Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
inside Immediately Stephen runs out and grabs Frans hand As
they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter

are confronted with two Zombies staggering slowly towards them
through the dust cloud from the chopper

again

for

Fran screams They have no weapons with them
Steve ROGERROGER

Under the whirling chopper blades Roger continues to fill the
fuel tank In the roar of the engine he cannot hear anything
else

A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter Rogers back is
to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger

Inside the chart house Peter stares at the closet door It is
still for a momentthen another moan and the door bangs

Peter fires two shots lower right and lower left of the first
forming a triangle

The two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve
Steve JUST RUN

Fran is petrified She turns and looks behind them They are
boxed in by the hangars

Steve RUN RIGHT PAST EMRIGHT AROUND EM
THEY CANT CATCH YOU

She hesitates The Zombies draw closer

Steve RUN FRANNIE GODDAMMIT IM RIGHT BEHIND YOU
WE CAN HANDLE THEM

Fran charges up the little grade She runs to the right of the
creatures and they move in her direction arms outstretched As
she draws near to the dead things she hesitates again in
fright The creatures claw at the air The one in front is
within a few feet of the woman

Steve RUN FRANNIE MOVE

Fran stares into the dead staring eyes of the lead Zombie She
is almost hypnotised At the last instant she runs and just
gets past the creatures A little up the grade she turns and

looks back stopping again

One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran The
other continues to advance on Stephen

Stephen ducks back into the open hangar It is very dark but

thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden

bloody

heap

the

fall

boards of the structure Stephen roots around among the greasy
tools which clutter the area He finds an enormous sledge
hammer He runs out of the shed

He dodges around the lead Zombie who staggers on with inertia
Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature The
man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
grade toward the Zombies back As he reaches the creature he
brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
against the ghouls skull with all his might

The creature staggers on for a few more steps its head a

pulp then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
the dust

Without breaking stride Stephen grabs Frans hand and the two
run toward the helicopter The other Zombie at the hangar has
turned around and is walking up the grade

Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
sees the frightened couple making for the chopper

As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
Roger from behind Steve shouts and Roger spins around The
stumbling creature is very close It raises its arms and its
hands clutch at the air Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
ground He is trapped at the side of the machine He doesnt
have his rifle He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
holster

Suddenly the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp The creature
has walked into the spinning chopper blade Its body staggers
forward another step or two then the thing collapses ina

Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper Steve lets go of
womans hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground He
lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle ducking in
the propeller draft

The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
almost loses its footing but it regains its balance and
advances steadily toward the helicopter

The shot misses clean He fires again The bullet grazes the

creatures face It staggers from the impact but does not

Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon Steve fires
two more rounds

138 Another miss and another graze this time on the arm
139 He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him stepping
up

alongside

Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
creatures brain

140 The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body

141 In the chart house Peter fires several more shots into the
closet door Bullet holes appear just where the creatures head
should be There seems to be no way that the volley could have
missed

Silence for a moment Peter still holds his gun high

Then with a great crash the closet door flies open into the

room Two small children burst out One has no left arm the

other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side They
are

dead They move directly toward Peter Their heads are at least

a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door

Peter stares down at the creatures revulsed He is so
startled

that he cannot react quickly enough and they are on him The

moment he feels their clammy grasp he regains his survival

instincts He cannot effectively aim his rifle He kicks and

thrashes around One creature flies against a wall The other
is

about to bite the mans arm The big Black grabs the small

Zombie and flings it physically back The other creature
pounces

on his back He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes

against its brother

Now Peter raises his gun As the children try to scramble to
their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession
First one creature falls then the other

Peter continues to fire his eyes wide with desperation and
disgust Finally his weapon clicks It is out of ammunition

Peter breathes heavily He stares at the small corpses
Instinctively he begins loading his weapon without even
looking at the action as he backs wearily out toward the door
of the chart house
142 Behind him in the brightly sunlit doorway we see the Zombie
who first appeared at the window The creature staggers
forward
Peter turns and startles He reaches for more shells and backs
away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun
The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room

Peter stares into the creatures eyes Then suddenly out in the

sunlight a few hundred feet behind the Zombie Stephen appears

with his rifle Peter sees the man over the creatures
shoulder

143 Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie but the barrel
seems to be on a straight line with Peter

144 Peter ducks quickly Steves gun fires The bullet misses the
creature cleanly and crashes into the room It ricochets off
the coffee machine Another shot crashes through the glass in
the front room

Peter crouches still stuffing shells into his weapon A third
of Stephens bullets tears through the Zombies shoulder but
the creature still stands It turns toward Peter slowly Peter
crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the

coffee
cups

145 Once again Roger steps up beside Stephen He fires one
carefully aimed shot looking through his telescopic range-
finder

146 Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon the Zombie crashes
into the room falling over the table and onto the floor

147 Fran is still kneeling in the dust trying to keep herself from
vomiting Stephen rushes to her side Roger keeping his rifle
poised shouts toward the chart house

Roger PETER

48 The big Black man appears in the doorway snapping the safety

on

his rifle

51 Frans retching causes her to choke and cough Steve tries to
comfort her not knowing what to say and shaking himself

52 Peter advances with long strides

53 Stephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away

Immediately he sees the anger in Peters eyes The big Trooper

of

then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen Steve tries to
stand but trips and falls on his back in the dust In an
instant Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
aimed at point blank range for the shivering mans forehead

Fran screams through her choking
Fran NOMY GODDONT WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Peter speaks calmly to Stephen in low tones

Peter YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE MISTER
ITS SCARY
ISNT IT
ISNT IT

Stephen looks up at the tall man shivering Then Peter lowers
his weapon and extends his hand helping Stephen up onto his
feet

Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
chopper Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
without saying another word

Roger helps Fran climb aboard Steve wanders around the front

the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilots seat Roger
climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
space beside Peter The big black offers the woman a sip of
water which she accepts Then she lets her head flop wearily
against the rear bulkhead

Steve is urgently surveying his flight charts shuffling the
papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of

the incident

Steve WE GOTTA FIND FUEL MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH

Roger NO WEVE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES
IT ITS ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
GET OUT ALIVE

Peter WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE
WE ALMOST DIDNT GET OUT OF HERE

Roger WERE GETTIN OUTA HERE FINE
AS LONG AS THERES NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
THINGS WE CAN HANDLE EM EASY

Peter YEAH WELL IT WASNT THOSE THINGS THAT
NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY

Stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily
Roger stops him by speaking urgently

Roger WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS THERES BOUND TO
BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE

Steve (reluctantly going back to his charts)
THERES THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY
FUEL STATIONS THERE PRIVATE AND STATE

Roger PROBLY STILL MANNED WE DONT NEED THOSE

Steve (angrily)
I GOT JAS ID SO DOES FRAN

Peter RIGHT AND WERE OUT HERE DOIN TRAFFIC REPORTS
WAKE UP SUCKER WERE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
WHAT WE ARE AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY

There is a long silence The engine drones but the helicopter
still sits on the ground The men look at each other Peter
takes a long slug of water

Fran JESUS CHRIST WE DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE WERE
GOING WE DONT HAVE A RADIO WERE RUNNING
OUT OF WATER WE NEED FOODSTEPHEN
YOU NEED TO SLEEP

We see a wide shot of the little airfield The JAS chopper
sits on the ground for a moment its props spinning The with
a surge of power it lifts off and flies away The dry earth
swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight

We see the facade of an enormous structure It is a huge
suburban shopping mall The outer walls are all concrete and
their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys The
building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground
There are only four entrances and the shops which are housed
within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot

In the immense area around the building lanes and stalls are
painted for automobile parking What few cars now dot the area
are parked randomly some with their doors open wide

We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in then we
see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the

see

bounce

reveals

which

cage-

roof of the building
In the parking lot walking among the abandoned vehicles we

several of the living dead They look almost like normal
shoppers at the mall for morning chores but their lumbering
walk is unmistakably stiff

At one of the mall entrances we see a revolving door flanked
by several regularly hinged doors all made of glass and
surrounded by large windows A few of the Zombies manage to
negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building Others

off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion One
creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly

There are a good many of the creatures but they are spread out
and far between They move with no seeming purpose

We do not yet see the mall interior The Zombies pay no
attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead

On the roof even as the blades of the helicopter still spin
the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building They
look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot

Fran OH MY GOD

Stephen NO CHANCE FORGET IT LETS GET OUTTA HERE
Roger WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTETHEY CANT

GET UP HERE

Steve YEAH AND WE CANT GO DOWN THERE

Roger LETS CHECK IT OUT

Roger trots away

Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building He
stares through one of them and can see into the mall below
Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles
Peter MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN I DONT THINK

THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES164 The vantage point only

a small aspect of the interior

a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
bubbles The space is open all the way down to the garden

is two storeys below Around the garden on the bottom floor can
be seen the entrances to several shops All but one have heavy
metal cage gates down and locked into position

One or two Zombies are seen wandering about They cannot enter
the stores except for the one which is un-gated

Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
the entire plaza it is a second storey of shops The same
gates seal off the visible store entrances but none of the

dead
creatures are evident on the balcony

165 Fran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles

Roger I HAVENT SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
FLOOR

Peter THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
FLOORS

Roger IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP

166 Peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop He
takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
the otherwise flat surface Roger follows

167 Fran (still staring down through a bubble)

WHAT ARE THEY DOING
WHY DO THEY COME HERE

Steve (also looking down)
SOME KIND OF INSTINCT MEMORYOF WHAT THEY
USED TO DO THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
THEIR LIVES

168 Below the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
plaza Some try the gates but cannot budge them One wanders

out
of the single open shop it is a female The shop is an
appliance store As the creature leaves she drags a toaster

idly
behind her pulling it by its power cable It scrapes on the
floor loudly

169 We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
the roof surface Behind the structures can be seen a large
power generator

170 Peter SOLAR SCREENS

Roger CANT BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE
Peter EMERGENCY SYSTEM MAYBE

Roger ITS PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE

Peter GUESS THE POWERS NOT OFF IN THIS AREA
A LOT OF PHILLYS STILL LIT COULD BE NUCLEAR

Roger HEY LOOK AT THIS

Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight There

are
several laid out over this particular area of the roof He

moves
to another while Peter looks down into the first Fran and
Stephen jog up

Roger THESE DONT GO DOWN INTO THE MALL
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness Peter pulls a
flashlight from his utility belt He has stayed in full
uniform
all the while where Roger has stripped off all but his
ammunition belt and pistol holster

172 The big man shines a light beam down into the space The floor
is only seven feet or so below the window There is absolutely
nothing in sight clear floor clear walls all light grey
Peter DAMN

173 Roger has moved to another window

Roger HEY OVER HERE THERES SOMETHIN HERE

174 Peter trots over and shines his beam down They see a vast
array of cardboard cartonshundreds of them
Roger STORAGE

175 Peter moves the light beam Now it illuminates a collection of
large drums stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
line of vision On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
of a triangle within a circle and the letters CD

176 Peter CIVIL DEFENCE CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY

Roger AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD

Steve HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE

Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
hopeless city-slick-sissy Then the big man brings his rifle

butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
the floor below

177 Inside - the vast space is impressive It is quite dark but for

rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights
We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums it
is very quiet The space is barren except for the stacks of
Civil Defence supplies

178 Suddenly a figure drops out of one of the skylights landing
on

its feet in the sunray It is Peter Instantly he readies
his rifle looking this way and that across

the large room Silence

Peter OK

He steps aside and Roger climbs in He too drops cat-like to
the

floor179 The two men instantly sling their rifles and move
to the food

cartons as by pre-arranged plan They carry the big boxes

quickly one at a time to the spot under the open skylight

In a moment they have built a pyramid out of the cartons It

creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the
window

above

180 Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
the cartons holding onto Rogers hand She is followed by an
anxious Stephen181 Peter has already wandered off There are

only two doors in the
enormous room one at either end The big Trooper moves up to
one of them as Roger comes up behind him gun ready Peters

hand turns the doorknob It is unlocked and the big man
gives Roger a familiar nod Roger stands several feet back his
rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire Then with

a

sudden commando-like motion Peter throws the door open and

ducks away flat against the wall Roger stiffens his finger
all

but pulling his trigger but there is no apparent danger
182 The door opens onto another vast room equivalent to the one
the

people are in It also has stacks of CD supplies

The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door
The

room is empty The same sunrays pierce the darkness through

skylights All is dead quiet This room has no doors at all
but

for the one Peter opened

Roger DOUBLE DAMN LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH BUDDY183 In the
first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the

cartons

Fran SPAM
Roger walks back into the room
Roger YOU BRING A CAN OPENER

Fran OH
Roger THEN DONT KNOCK SPAM ITS GOT ITS OWN KEY

The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
key

Peter has walked right past the group He is moving quickly
toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room
Again Roger follows

184 At the door the two Troopers go through the same SWAT
procedure The door swings open this time onto a very small
space Again no immediate danger

185 As the men enter they discover that they are on the top
landing
of a concrete and metal firestair There are no windows and
the
air is musty There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling
but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark and
there the stairs wind even further down they recede into
blackness

Roger WHATDYA THINK

The Black man just stares first down into the darkness then
back into the storage area

Roger THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE WHATDYA THINK
cur

186 A great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
stairway door

187 Near the pyramid under the open skylight the group of refugees
sits on the floor

Stephen is asleep Fran sits next to his curled form her hand

in his hair Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in

the lotus position his gun across his legs squarely facing
the

suspicious stairwell He and Roger still pick at their food

Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled

from one of the CD drums

Roger YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP TOO BUDDY
Peter THERES AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
WE COULD USE BROTHER

Roger KNOW IT

Fran stiffens at the talk She doesnt believe what she is
hearing She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
mall Peter THEYRE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE

ITS A BIG PLACE I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN EM

Roger HIT AND RUN

Peter HIT AND RUN MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO

Fran YOURE CRAZY Roger THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE
WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT

188 Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons Peter still
sits checking his own guns

189 Fran THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WERE TRYING TO GET AWAY
FROMLOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT

Peter THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS
WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED

Fran STEPHEN (the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
it all)

Peter (standing)
LEAVE HIM BE WERE GOIN OURSELVES

The big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephens rifle He
snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber He
hands it to the woman Peter THATS READY TO SHOOT BE
CAREFUL
Fran holds the gun gingerly Peter THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES
REAL EASY BUT THE WEAPONLL
KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES BE READY FOR THAT

Fran WAIT A MINUTE I
Peter ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS YOU GUYS

TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE WELL TRY TO MAKE IT
OUT TO THE PARKIN LOT YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE

Fran just stares up at the big man with desperation in her
eyes She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers

decision is made

Peter IF WE DONT SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES
WELL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER

TIME YOU UNDERSTAND190 In the dimly lit firestair
the door on the top landing pulls
open suddenly The stairway is still empty The Troopers

move slowly out onto the landing They look down
into the darkness below Then they move slowly and silently
down
the steps Fran appears on the upper landing She stands in the
doorway clutching the rifle Peter stops for a moment
looking back up at the frightened
woman Peter YOULL PROBLY HEAR SOME SHOOTING
JUST DONT PANIC OK

Fran sighs exhaustedly

Peter YOULL BE ALRIGHT ITS OUR ASSES THATS IN

THE FIRE
191 Two landings below there is almost no light Roger clicks on
his flashlight and shines the beam around He is in a very
small
concrete space The stairs go down no further There is only
one

door Peter eases down the steps behind Roger THIS IS THE
ONLY WAY UP THERE192 We see the other side of the metal door It
stands in another

cement walled space which also seems small from our angle but

it is fully lit The door opens slowly and the Troopers
cautiously step out As

the camera swings around we see that the men are at the end of

a long narrow hallway Directly across from them are two open

supply rooms one containing a stationery sink and a toilet

Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies193 Down along the
hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways Some

doors are open some are closed Along the opposite wall there

is nothing The far end of the hall about a hundred yards
away opens out
onto the second story of the mall proper194 The men look at

one another and slowly move down the corridor

They try the first two doors which are locked The third is
wide open

195 Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised It is
a large administrative office with rows of desks which are
fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants196
The next room has a closed door but it is unlocked Peter
swings the door open and silently jumps into the room This is
a much more spartan area with two metal desks and a few

chairs

There are several phones It is a maintenance office On one
wall is a large map of the mall with pin flags and scribbling
over an acetate which covers the drawing At the other end of
the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
to another map of the mall showing electrical installations
On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
cabinets One is open It contains all sorts of tools manual
and electric There are circuit testers walkie talkie units

and
there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys
also colour and number coded Peter grabs up one of the rings
and Roger steps up behind him Roger THE KEYS TO THE
KINGDOM197 Back in the hallway Rogers hand tries another doorknob
and throws the door open This opens onto beautifully plush
offices
obviously the executive headquarters The rooms

interconnect and while Peter walks from door to door

in the corridor Roger moves through the inner doors meeting

Peter at each room One office is more elegant than the next

with the latest in designer furniture and expensive
decorations198 The Troopers finally reach a room on which both
the interior and

corridor doors are closed and locked The brass nameplate on
the

interior door reads CJ Porter - President199 Roger moves out
to the corridor where he joins Peter They move

into the exterior corridor They are very near the end of the

hall and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand They

can only see a small section200 The balcony on their side is
railed off against the open drop

down to the first floor and across the great cavity they see
the opposite balcony On the far side only two store fronts can
be seen They are both gated and shut
201 The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall
proper
They look at each other and move forward each clinging to
opposite walls in the corridor202 As they reach the mall proper
they slowly and carefully peer
around their respective corners

203 The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
building and at several points bridges across from one side to
the other Little shops of all types run along the entire

length
of the balcony and at each far end stands the entrance arches
for a large department store Most of the stores are gated
but several seem open The big
department stores are gated and locked Here and there tall
trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
the second storey There are none of the living dead evident on
the balcony204 The two troopers move slowly and quietly to
the railing The
crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail Below the
sight is even more spectacular205 Stores of every type offer
gaudy displays of consumer items Everything from clothing to
appliances Photo equipment audio
and video outlets sporting goods and weaponry gourmet foods
and natural organic foods There is a Book Store a Record
Store a Real Estate Agency and a Bank A Novelty Shop a Gift
Shop all with the absolute latest in American consumer items
And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
end of a Cathedral stand the mammoth two storey Department
Stores great symbols of a consumer society
Down the centre of the ground floor along with the gardens and
park benches are little stalls One is a Tobacco Specialist
another Jewellery another is a small Photo Portrait stall

where
mothers had their children photographed There are restaurants
and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
everything from childrens toys to Blood Pressure readings
There is a large turntable designed to spin but which is now
still holding a late model car on exhibit Another turntable
displays futuristic household appliances The images are all too
familiar but in their present state they
appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
Customs of a civilisation now gone

The ghosts of a civilisation however are not figments in the
mind They are quite real And they walk below in the aisles of
the great Cathedral At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
the Troopers perspective

206 Roger ITS CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE BUDDY

Peter FAT CITY BROTHER HOW WE GONNA WORK IT Roger WE GET
INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE THEY PROBLY
HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE

Peter LETS CHECK THOSE KEYS

207 The Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back
into
the administrative corridor Then they move quickly down the
hall toward the Maintenance Office

208 As the men leave the balcony the camera pans Several yards
away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores It is
followed by a second creature a female without one arm They
are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor

209 In the Maintenance Office the Troopers are checking the keys
against the coded map on the wall

Roger SEVENTY TWOU AND D HERE IT IS

The men check the keys Peter finds corresponding numbers
Peter HERE
Roger LETS JUST HOPE ITS RIGHT Peter LOOK HERE (on the map)
THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
BE LOCKS (he points) FRONTSIDEBACK OUTSIDE
MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKSBUT WHAT ARE THESE

The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be
within

the big Department Store they are studying Roger

WASHROOMSEQUIPMENTI DUNNO Roger moves off toward the
electrical control panel Peter still

stares at the map Peter I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES
Roger HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC
Peter WHAT210 The big Black moves up behind his partner

One of the controls

on the panel is marked MUSIC TAPE It indicates a master
switch

which is in the off position Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS

and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS There are dozens

of master switches which are in the off mode

Peter POWER SWITCHES

Roger THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE Peter HIT EM
ALL MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN EVERYTHING WE MIGHT
NEED IT

Roger hits the switches one at a time

211 Throughout the mall we hear the drone of the dull mass
produced music designed to lull a shoppers brain212
Upstairs Francine startles at the sound from below She snaps
the rifle into her hands ready to fire She has been standing
just inside the storage area She steps into the firestair and
looks down into the darkness The sounds of the insipid music
drift up to her She leans into the storage area again

Fran STEPHEN
STEPHEN

213 Steve still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid
slowly awakens214 Down on the first floor of the big mall
things begin to work
The automobile turntable starts spinning the great escalators
move up and sown Two of the living dead caught just starting
up two stalled escalator fall and roll down as the mechanical
steps begin moving

Lights blink on the exhibits and mechanical window displays
begin their robot-like motions It is like a Carnival coming
alive The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
confusion Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
exhibits215 In a very tall cage which reaches from the first
floor all the

way to the ceiling the Tropical Birds which are housed within

begin to flutter and squawk216 In a pet shop there are
puppies and kittens in a window

display They whine and scramble over one another in fright at

the noise and the motion and the coloured lights217 On one
of the floor exhibits a rear-projection movie starts It

is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate

Developers new tract of suburban houses A narrator speaks in

a

friendly voice
and for prices which anyone can
afford you can live in these luxurious new homes
by Brandon Fully electric central air etc

218 In the Maintenance Office the Troopers ready themselves for
their raid Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility
belt and the move out
Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
exterior corridor

219 Just as Roger moves through the door into the corridor he is

confronted by the Zombies from the balcony He startles and

ducks back into the room The closest Zombie is reaching out

with clutching hands Peter raises his gun and fires two shots

cleanly through the creatures head220 As the shots ring
through the area Fran standing at the top of

the firestair startles Steve grabs the rifle from the woman

Steve JESUS CHRIST
THEYRE MANIACS

221 The Troopers step over the corpse The second Zombie the
arm less female is walking toward them This time Roger fires
his weapon The creature falls in a heap Roger WHATDYA THINK
BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT

Peter YOU GAME Roger nods and the two men run down the
hall toward the mall Their rifles poised they are like
commandos on an important

mission

The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start
for

it They run from the corridor onto the balcony222 The
battle to win the mall has begun The creatures which wander

the first floor look about attracted by the sound but they
are

confused They walk this way and that in mis-guided staggering

strides223 Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-
escalator They
fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving

stairway224 A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall
against

each other from the movement but one falls onto the moving
steps and is carried upward Then another manages to keep its
balance holding on to the hand rail

225 At another point down the length of the mall there is a
stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second
floor Several creatures move up the steps

226 At the top of the firestair Stephen begins to move down the
steps cautiously His rifle is at the ready Fran stays on the
top landing Fran STEPHEN DONT GO DOWN

THERE (he continues)

STEPHEN PLEASE
Steve ITS ALRIGHT

227 At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store
the two Troopers come to a crashing stop

228 There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
point and in the hall are four or five Zombies They are about
three hundred feet away

229 Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
big roll gate He fumbles with the keys for a moment until

he finally sinks the proper key into the receptacle which is right

at the floor The tumblers turn successfully Peter ALRIGHT

230 On the escalator the creatures which fell onto the moving

steps
are being carried up to the balcony The one supporting himself
on the hand rail is still standing The head of the standing
Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Rogers perspective

231 The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creatures

forehead

Peter tries to life the roll gate It wont move It is still
locked Peter YOU BASTARD
Roger WHAT

Peter STILL LOCKED (he sees another assembly)
ON THE SIDE

The big man moves to the far side of the gate The same key
fits Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
escalator It is quite near the top now Roger is about to
shoot when something catches his eye
232 The fallen Zombies which up to now could not be seen behind
the escalator rail wall suddenly come tumbling out onto the
balcony

floor233 Roger fires but his aim is inaccurate234

He hits the standing Zombie in the neck The creature is
thrown off balance enough to lose its footing It falls back down the

escalator but before it reaches the bottom it stops rolling

The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again It is

still very much alive The two creatures on the balcony
struggle

to stand235 Roger looks back over his shoulder236 The
Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and

fifty feet away

237 Peter turns the key in the lock but again the gate will not
lift It moves slightly as the middle mechanism and the one on
the far right are free but there is a third lock on the far
left Peter moves to it quickly238 On the first floor

concourse other creatures are beginning to take note of the

action upstairs They start to move239 The Zombies on the stationary
stairway are beginning to reach
the second floor but they are far down the main balcony They
will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
the Department Store

240 Roger fires again
241 One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap
242 At the sound of the rifle Fran gets desperate

Fran STEPHENFOR GODS SAKELETS GET UP ON THE
ROOF 243 Steve is at the middle landing He
stares down into the darkness
below More gunfire can be heard from the mall

Steve ITS ALRIGHT IM TELLIN YA THOSE
THINGS DONT MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US More
gunfire can be heard244 Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud
rumble Peter ducks into
the store even as the gate is still rising but the inertia of
the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peters grasp
He
jumps to try to catch it but he misses It jerks up into its
fully open position and rolls back down slightly but still
Peter cannot reach the lip It slides back to rest about three
feet above Peters fingertips245 The Zombies advance 246
Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head then he
backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance Peter
is desperately looking around for something to stand on to

reach
the gate247 The Zombies are very close to the arch now

advancing steadily

causes

the

Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes but it is
heavy for him to move himself
Peter HERECOME ON

Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
drag the little counter The men drag it to a point just at the
side of the open arch and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
of it At that instant a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
Peters legs The big man kicks startled and the motion

him to fall off the little counter He lands on his feet but
out on the balcony beyond the arch Roger brings his rifle butt
around against the creatures head and the Zombie falls back
but is not dead

Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter whose gun sits
on the little counter inside the store Roger levels off his
rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line Peter makes a
move and like a football player jukes to the left then to

right He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
the store Now Roger fires dropping one then another Peter

jumps back up on the counter Peter BEHIND YOUBEHIND YOU

The

the

more

floor

The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
display and is regaining its footing Roger turns and fires
creature falls Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
to bring it down

There are several creatures right in the archway now they
clutch with their hands One blocks the downward progress of
gate Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back The
gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
creatures Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down
Peter still gripping the lip jumps off the counter to get

leverage The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the
The two

men are able to move it steadily downward The Zombies are very
weak but more creatures appear making it more difficult Then
one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate Its torso just gets
through as the gate slams down against its chest Its arms grab
for Peters legs and its mouth is gasping Its body is
preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms
Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
creatures outside Grabbing his rifle Roger brings the butt
straight down on the clutching Zombies skull The Zombie goes
limp Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate
but the pressure is too great
Roger LET UP A LITTLELET UP A LITTLE

The gate rises a few inches More Zombies appear outside Their

hands clutch at the roll gate The openings in the grid are
only

big enough for their fingers their hands cant reach through

but they are pushing the gate higher and highermore than

Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse With his rifle
butt Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear

except for one of its arms From outside a creatures hand

suddenly grabs Rogers weapon For a moment its like a Tug-O-

War

Peter is having a harder time holding the gate It is inching

upward Peter COME ONCOME ON Roger lets go his gun
barrel and the weapon is snatched away by

the creature in the crowd Roger grabs for the gate Peter

THE ARMTHAT ARMS IN THE WAY Roger squats again and
manages to throw the dead Zombies arm clear Then he grabs the gate
again Now it starts to move down

more steadily At the last moment another clutching arm

juts into the store

but when the gate hits it it withdraws and the big cage
clicks

solidly into place

he two Troopers step back from the gate The creatures still
oan and gurgle slamming against the gate their fingers
lutching at the grid but they are unable to budge it

here are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
epartment Store and several others are making their way along
he balcony At least six lie dead along the floor Roger
ELLWERE INNOW HOW THE HELL WE GONNA

ET BACK Peter LETS GO SHOPPIN FIRST

QSectunH ABH

The two men back into the aisles of the store The creatures
outside still push and claw at the gate The one with Rogers
rifle uses it as a bludgeon but it has no effect

249 Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor

250 From his perspective the hall is inactive He observes the
washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices

251 He starts into the corridor letting the firestair door close

252 At the top of the firestair Fran can see the beam of light
from
the open door below As the door closes the beam narrows then
it blinks out with a click as the door closes Fran
STEPHENJESUS GOD
She is very frightened She backs into the storage area253
She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the
roof She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers254
In the Department Store Roger is riding down an escalator He
has found a back pack and it is obviously already filled with
goods As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor
the surroundings are eerily quiet255 He moves through a
clothing department We see the dead looking
faces of store mannequins Roger runs into one and is greatly
startled He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
his waist by its arms then he trots off down another aisle
where he finds Peter

256 The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching

up
a small television

Roger HEY MAN WE CANT CARRY ALL THIS SHIT

257 Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
which we cannot yet see As Roger trots up he sees that Peter
has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods

Roger OHWERE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY EM RIGHT Peter
WE GONNA TRY BROTHER WE AINT DOIN THIS

FOR THE EXERCISE WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO

GET WHAT WE CAN

Roger THERES NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN

Even though he doesnt understand the plan Roger helps Peter
toss things into the barrow

258 They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
supplies Electrical cables flashlights batteries They scoop
things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
in a store to grab whatever they can259 Stephen is in the

Maintenance office He examines the maps and electrical equipment

then rummages through a desk260 At the open end of the corridor

leading to the second storey

balcony Zombies wander past as they head for the Store
entrance

where many creature still claw at the roll gate261 The

Zombies move randomly Some are leaving the gate as their prey is

now out of sight They begin to wander here and there

262 Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor
and
start toward the offices

263 Stephen has found a large binder in the desk It contains all
the plans for the mall duplicating the charts on the walls and
many others It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
the workings and layout of the huge structure264 Elevator
doors slide open with a loud whoosh The two Troopers
appear in the car wheeling their barrow out onto the second
storey aisles of the big store265 Now they can see the roll
gate and the creatures pushing at it
ineffectively They roll their barrow very close to the gate
When the Zombies catch sight of the humans their efforts are
renewed They moan and push harder at the gate266 They
Troopers leave the barrow disappearing back to the aisles They run
onto the interior escalator bounding down faster than
the moving steps then they run across the first floor until
they see the lower level-roll gate267 There are creatures
wandering the concourse but none of them are at the gate Peter
LETS GO BROTHERTHE OLD OKEY DOKE

The men move up to the roll gate A Zombie lumbers past Roger
speaks to the creature

Roger HEY UGLY

The creature turns instantly Registers Then dives for the
gate with a moaning roar Its mouth opens and its hands clutch
The gate pops forward from the creatures thrust but it holds
tightly The action causes Roger to jump even though there is

no

immediate danger Peter LETS RAISE SOME HELLHEYHEY
(he is shouting)
Roger OVER HERELETS GO OVER HERE

268 Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
Store They lumber along attracted by the sounds

269 At the gate several Zombies push at the metal grids The
Troopers back away but stay in sight of the creatures

Peter JUST GIVE IT TIME GIVE IT TIME

270 Upstairs the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
commotion below They begin to move away from the gate and
lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators

271 n the maintenance office Stephen still rummages He finds a
loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt He moves to the

large

cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys272 In the
corridor the stray Zombies move in and out of the

executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance
room273 Several creatures fall over one another as they try to
move down

floor They scramble to their feet and move toward the
Department Store

In the concourse many creatures are moving toward the gate
Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
metal grid Through the crowd Peter can see several other
creatures lumbering down the stationary steps

Peter OKTHEY RE COMIN

The big man readies his walkie talkie pulling the antenna
Peter GO ON UPSTAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME

WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH Roger clutching his
talkie disappears among the aisles
as he runs crouching into the store Peter tries to hold the
attention of the creatures at the gate Peter RIGHT HERE

THIS IS WHERE ITS AT

YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERSYOU DUMBYOU ARE DUMB

Upstairs the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
moves through the second floor aisles stealthily277 Stephen

takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office He

13s

runs

are

walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
exterior corridor As the door opens the Zombies attack The
Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie
arm Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor

Stephen starts up the firestair to the door Just then he hears
Fran call out Realising he will lead the creatures to her he
closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and

in

Stephen runs into the office and slams the door

A second creature is moving up behind the first and another
enters the corridor from the accounting office

The metal door locks only with a key Stephen fumbles for a
moment with his rifle then dives for the key cabinet There

hundreds of keys on rings He looks at the wall map He cant
focus in his panic

n the hall the first creature slams against the floor It
doesnt even have the intelligence to reach for the knob It
pounds on the door with its hands

The pounding increases Stephens panic He stares at the map
trying to focus on the maze of numbers

fq

The second creature reaches the door and claws at it The third

The

approaches slowly

Stephen rattles among the keys His fingers shake and he cannot
decipher the numbers

Outside one of the creatures in its random clutching takes
hold of the knob and pushes in and out not yet turning it

Stephen clutching one of the rings throws himself against the
door still trying to read the numbers The knob finally turns
The door opens against Stephens weight He manages to slam it
shut despite the pushing creatures He throws the key ring down
and grabs his gun
Roger speaks into his walkie talkie
Roger I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON
Peter downstairs talks into his unit
Peter CLEAR
Roger (over talking unit)
NOT ALTOGETHER BUT THEYRE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
GOODENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON
The creatures slam against the first floor gate but it holds
securely Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
unit He backs slowly away into the depths of the store
Upstairs Roger peers from behind a counter

The second floor gate is clear

On the balcony several creatures wander aimlessly but most of
them have already moved down the steps and escalators

Peter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
entrance He clips his talk unit onto his belt then ducks and
disappears among the aisles

He runs crouching out of sight until he rounds a far wall
and comes up into the elevator

He enters the car and pushes 2 The doors glide shut and the
car begins to move up

At the door of the Maintenance Office the knob turns again

door pushes open against Stephen weight His feet slide on the
linoleum floor He cannot get the door closed this time Biting
into

lunges

the

his lip he makes the sign of the cross and backs suddenly

the room holding his rifle high The door flies open with a
slam and three Zombies advance into the office Stephen tries
to aim carefully and he fires

Just as the elevator doors open Peter hears the gunfire He
hesitates for a moment then runs toward the entrance arch

Roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate The
gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism

Along the balcony some of the creatures turn around in con-
fusion They walk this way and that attracted by the sound

Peter thunders up behind Roger

Peter WHAT THE HELL IS THAT

Roger FUZZ MAYBE

Peter OR MAYBE FLYBOY WHERES IT COMIN FROM
Roger CANT TELL

Peter COME ON OPEN UP

Roger MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHATS HAPPENIN

Peter OPEN UP CAN GET THE WAGON OVER IF IT
IS FLYBOY LETS GET HIM ON OUR SIDE

Roger moves to the second lock More gunfire

Peter (setting his weapon on the floor)
YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD YOU HEAR

Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
the handles of the barrow

The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor its head shot
through Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
into the Maintenance Office

The third staggers into the room Stephen stands fast now He
holds his rifle out in front of him The creature walks toward

the gun Steve holds his hands on the trigger The Zombie

suddenly and grabs the gun barrel Steve fires but the blast
tears through the creatures chest Steve struggles to raise

barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
again

accurately The gun fires again this time grazing the Zombies
neck With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
gun free Steve backs against the wall The creature tosses the
rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk The
Zombie advances on Steve Steve is next to the key cabinet and
grabs at it trying to find some weapon He feels the tools in
the cabinet and comes up with a hammer The Zombie is about to
reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
cabinet The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet but
doesnt fall Steve tries to hit the creatures head with the
tool he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm trying to bite
it Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor
The creature clutches at the mans legs its teeth bared like
an animal Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
squarely in the creatures face The Zombie comes after him

and from his crawling position Steve brings the hammer as an
uppercut to the creatures jaw The creature falls back enough
for Steve to crawl across the floor It follows but Steve
reaches the desk and grabs his rifle Rolling on the floor he
fires several shots into the creature finally destroying it

The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies

The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
which are still wandering the balcony They turn slowly

Just as he rounds the corner Peter almost collides with one
creature and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow He
manages to get past and he runs as fast as he can toward the
opening of the Administrative corridor

Roger does not let the gate roll up too high He stabilises the
metal grid well within reach then he stands his post with
Peters rifle Several creatures approach from the opposite
direction Roger fires at the closest one It falls The others
are still too far away to waste bullets

Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
maintenance manual He rushes into the corridor and runs out

Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway

At first Stephen freezes then he starts backing toward the
firestair his rifle poised

Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor a Zombie
steps out of the hallway into his path Peter slams the barrow
squarely into the creatures legs The Zombie falls in the
barrow onto the supplies The big man slams the load against a
wall at the mouth of the corridor Before the Zombie can get

its

balance the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creatures

jacket lapels With all his might he flings the creature out

against the balcony railing The creature flips over the rail

but does not fall Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up

quickly behind and flips it over the rail The creature makes
no

sound as it plummets to the concourse below310 Roger fires
again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near Other creatures
throughout the area are again converging on the

Department Store entrance311 Peter wheels the barrow into
the corridor and sees Steve at the other end the three Zombies are
still closing in Peter HOLD IT FLYBOY 312 Steve freezes He can

barely see Peter his vision blocked by
the Zombies The creatures are about thirty feet away313
Peter DONT GO INTO THE STAIRWAY314 Stephen is confused
The creatures advance315 Peter DONT OPEN THAT DOOR BABY YOULL
LEAD EM
RIGHT UP WITH YOU

316 Steve is on the verge of panic

Peter RUN FOR IT RUN THIS WAY
The Zombies are drawing closer and closer317 Peter COME ON
MAN RUN THIS WAY YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
THROUGH EM WE GOTTA LEAD EM AWAY FROM HERE

318 Steve sizes up the corridor It is narrow but there is room to
run past the Zombies

319 Peter COME ON FLYBOY YOU CAN MAKE IT COME ON

320 With a sudden move Steve breaks into a run He passes the

first creature easily The second grabs him as he runs past but the
man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall He
keeps moving forward The third creatures stands in his path
Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombies chest The
creature flies back and falls Steve falls and tumbles toward
the mouth of the passageway He regains his footing as the
creatures turn to pursue him he runs to the end of the hall

where Peter waits Peter NOWHEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT
STORE GO321 The two men run across the balcony They slam into
two other Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success
322 At the entrance arch to the store Roger fires at another

creature It falls Other Zombies are approaching but Steve
and

Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the

gate without a problem

The Zombies converge on the area as they did before clutching
and pushing at the metal cage which holds them out securely
The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate
Peter DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN SAME TRICK

323 The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
down the escalator

324 On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
pull up wheezing with exhaustion

Steve WHAT DO WE DO

Roger LET EM KNOW WERE HERE

(shouting)

WHOOOO HOOOOOOOVER HEREYEEE HAAAAAAAA
Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation Peter smiles
at the young pilot

Peter YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY
HOW BOUT IT

Stephen laughs some more nervously at first then whole-
Heartedly Then he lets out a loud

Steve WHOOOOOOQOOOOOPEEREEEREERE

He has joined the cowboys He is like a child almost exultant

with the joy of their victory

The three men shout through the cage at the creatures which
are already gathering at the gate

325 Out on the concourse a few Zombies wander aimlessly but most
are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch

326 On the upstairs balcony Zombies again move toward the
stationary steps and the escalators

327 The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
the open mall Two walk out on the balcony but the last one
turns into an open office Then it staggers back out and heads
down the hall toward the firestair

328 Fran can faintly hear the whooping of the men as she moves
toward the stairway door which is still open329 She
steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness The shouting
stops Desperate with fear she moves back to the
storage room then back onto the landing Now her fear turns
into anger Fran SHIT She takes a few steps down
the stairs Stops Goes back up
Fran GOD DAMMIT
She starts back down again

330 In the corridor below the creature walks into another office
Then it moves back into the hall

331 The Zombies crash against the first floor gate It holds The
men crouch in the shadows of the gate

Roger WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE

Peter NO THERES ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
STAYIN UP ON THE BALCONY

Roger YEAH BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT WE CAN BREAK THROUGH

Peter IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US THEYLL JUST

Roger WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN EMLOAD UP WHAT

Roger OH MAN Peter IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE
WITHOUT THEM CATCHIN ON WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE
AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH
CHECK OUT THE RADIO SEE WHATS HAPPENIN
Roger MAN I DONT KNOW Steve THERES SOME KIND OF
PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
OF THE STORES

The Troopers look at the young pilot almost surprised to hear
him speak He has been quiet up until now

Steve I DONT KNOW IF ITS JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
IF ITS SOME KIND OF ACCESS I SAW IT ON A MAP

Peter UPSTAIRS LETS GO

The three move off down the aisles then duck out of sight

around a corner The Zombies clutch at the metal gate moaning

and rattling the grid loudly 332 In the Maintenance hallway
we see the thick manual lying on the floor A lumbering foot kicks
it as the Zombie in the corridor

wanders into another office The creature ignores the book as

it does the corpses strewn in the hall333 In the fire
stair Fran is on the middle landing She is

suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea She clutches at her

stomach retching She sits on the landing letting her head

flop against the wall She is almost in tears334 The
upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and the men trot
out As they clear a wall they see the entrance arch335 There
are no Zombies at the gate but two are seen drifting
along the balcony outside

336 Peter WATCH ITDONT LET EM SEE YOU

The men move stealthily along the aisles They look up at the
ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels Peter
shines
his flashlight beam into one
337 The ceiling is about twelve feet high but the light beam
penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above338
Roger LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH Peter THEYRE LOCKED

Roger DAMN THATS THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
SAW ON THE CHART

Steve WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED

Peter JACKPOT FLYBOY YOURE RIGHT

Roger WHAT Peter THEYRE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET
THROUGH EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE
BUILDING Steve OVER HERE339 Steve notices that one of the
ceiling grids is very close to the

elevators Peter looks at the grids then down at the double

doors Peter THE ELEVATOR SHAFT

He moves over and hits the button The doors open

Peter HOLD EM Roger stands against the rubber safety
bumper holding the car

doors open wide Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches

up for the escape hatch which is held in place by four knub-

headed bolts He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the

hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen Then the big
man sticks his head up through the opening340 He looks around the
elevator shaft shining his flash this way and that He sees

another grid in the shaft wall

Peter ITS HEREAND IT AINT LOCKED GET A SCREW-
DRIVER AND SOMETHIN TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE

341 Roger I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE GET ONE OF THOSE
TABLES

Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table The
elevator doors close When Steve returns with the table he has
to hit the button again The doors open Peter is already
climbing out of the car into the shaft Steve uses the table to
hold the doors open and goes to get another

This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top He climbs
up and sticks his head out into the shaft The doors close
again342 In the greasy black shaft amid the cables and
elevator mechanisms Peter examines the wall grid with his
flashlight Peter ITS ALRIGHTWE CAN GET IT OFF
YOU FOUND IT FLYBOY

Even though he speaks softly Peters voice has an eerie
echoing sound in the narrow shaft

343 The car doors open Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools ina
shopping
bag Roger ONE-STOP SHOPPING ANYTHING YOU NEED
RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 344 Steve relays the tools

up to Peter who immediately begins to
work on the screws which mount the grid He passes the
flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area345
Fran sits in the stairwell her hand over her mouth It is very
quiet for a moment then she hears a slight clicking Her head
snaps to attention She stares down at the bottom landing

There
is a thump at the door Slowly the woman stands to her feet
her eyes transfixed on the
door below Fran STEPHEN
The door starts to open Light creeps in The slow lumbering
figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair Choking back a
scream Fran turns and runs up the stairs The creature below
follows unsure of itself in the dim light
346 At the top Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the

door For a moment she just backs away in terror Then she
gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
barricade She struggles with one of the cartons It is very
heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip The smooth
cardboard slips in her hands347 The Zombie has almost reached
the middle landing
348 Roger looks down through a ceiling grid He sees the interior
of
a Sporting Goods Store Along one wall is an arsenal of the
latest weaponry for the sportsman349 Roger SWEET JESUS
Peter I SEEN IT COME ON The men are in a large ductwork
which seems to run along the
entire length of the mall They move as quietly as they can
There are several side tunnels branching off in both
directions

350 Steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down He sees a
full equipped radio and electronics shop

Roger I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOURE GOIN BUDDY

Peter (who is leading)
THIS IS IT COME ON

351 Fran struggles with the carton She gets it against the door
finally and moves to haul another

352 The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door

353 Before the woman can bring another carton over she sees the
door move She throws herself against it but cant plant her
feet well because of the carton of the floor The door moves an
inch at a time The creatures hand reaches into the room It
clutches at the edge of the door

354 Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid where she
turns and faces the door

355 The creature is straining against the weight of the carton

Now
now both its hands clutch the door edge The carton moves
another inchand another Now the creatures head can be

seen
as it strains to get through the widening space

356 Frans eyes are wide almost hypnotised She looks for

something
to use as a weapon The room is bare but for the cartons and
water drums She is about to opt for the skylight when she
glimpses Rogers knap-sack in the shadows She runs for it as
the creature finally breaks into the big room

357 The womans hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
sack Nothing appropriate She dumps the contents out
ammunition mace cans batteries flaresflares She
nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
to deal with the paper wrapping

358 The Zombie moans as it draws closer It is approaching the
pyramid of cartons

359 Fran manages to free the wrapping and snaps the cylinder in

two
at the mark

360 Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid cutting off her
immediate route It is very near Fran backs away a few steps

as

she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
cylinder cap It doesnt fireshe tries againand again
Now the Zombie has reached the knap-sack It kicks through the
items and knocks and rolls the other flares

Frans flare finally catches with a great whoosh the bright
she

flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie The creatures
eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness
The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature

and throws the Zombies enormous shadow against the cartons and
wall The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over

the articles on the floor

Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc The
creature swats the air keeping distance but threatening

Fran considers the firestair door but decides on the pyramid
She circles around to a point where she can climb up from
behind the moaning Zombie She rushes for the cartons and
climbs but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
and crashes into the topmost carton It starts to slide off
the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
Zombie The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid

The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
skylight but cant pull herself up She accidentally drops
two flares including the lit one It tumbles to the floor
behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombies
eyes Now the creature tries to climb to the woman

Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
hands for the skylight She lifts with all her might and her
feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up As

tries to lower her feet back to the cartons the pyramid shakes
and wobbles from the Zombie The creature is making progress
its hands can almost touch Frans foot

Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office Rogers
legs appear through the grid and he too swings down holding on
with his hands to soften his landing

Suddenly we are aware of a third person on the room in the
large chair at the desk Roger startles and grabs his gun
Peter just stares They are in the Presidents office Some
days earlier the President shot himself in the head

Peter COME ON

Steve struggles overhead

Peter JUST DROP I GOT YOU

Steve I CANT1

Peter (to Roger)
THE DESKGIMME A HAND
The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
Presidents corpse The action causes the chair to spin

frame

of

it

and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action

The desk in place Steves toes can reach its surface He loses
his balance slightly and pulls back up He kicks a picture

off the desk onto the floor shattering the glass over photos
the Presidents wife and children
Peter COME ON

Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
down He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk

Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor He opens
a crack and peeks out

The corridor is empty He sees the door at the end which leads
to the exterior corridor

As the other men come up behind Peter opens the door quietly
and slips into the hall He starts to walk quickly toward the
door to the exterior corridor Roger follows as Stephen moves
backwards toward the fire stairs

Peters hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening

In the corridor Steve clutches the maintenance manual Peter
backs slowly up the hall The wheels squeak and the big man
bites his lip Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall Steve
notices that the fire stairs door is open wide

Steve JESUS CHRIST

He bounds towards the door Roger spins to see what happened
Peter turns and quickens his pace Steve trots up the steps

Roger (to Peter)
COME ONYOU GOT IT

Peter runs with the cart the last few yards As he gets to the
doorway Roger breaks up the steps

Steve breaks into the storage areahe drops the manual

Steve FRANNIE

gets

The woman turns in Steves direction The Zombie swats the
flare out of Frans hand She startles and the cartons feel as
though they will topple She steadies herself with both hands
The creature is grabbing at her legs She kicks

Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot

Roger DONT SHOOTTHEYLL HEAR YA

Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid

The creature is still clutching at Fran She kicks violently as
Roger pulls the back of the Zombies clothing The Zombie falls
and hits the floor As it kneels up Steve swings the butt of
his rifle and smashes it into the things head Then Roger

delivers a blow with his gun straight down

Steve rushes to Fran She falls off the cartons into his arms
sobbing and choking

Steve FRANNIEARE YOU ALRIGHT
YOU OK FRANNIE HEY

The woman is incoherent She is clutching at her stomach

Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
items He dumps them on the floor

Peter LETS GET THIS STUFF UP COME ON

Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door Peter comes to
help and Fran starts to wretch Steve tries to calm her He

some water in a can and brings it over

Steve FRANNIEITS OKCOME ON ITS OKARE YOU
HURT HUN DID YA HURT YOURSELF FRANNIE

Downstairs at the exterior corridor Peter peeks out He can
see the mall at the far end The coast is clear He and Roger
hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
floor and retreat back into the fire stairs Peter holds open
the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment
Convinced theyve not been seen he closes the door

Peter I THINK WERE OK BROTHER
They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs

Steve still tries to comfort Fran

asleep

the

small

Steve WERE OKWERE ALL OKWE GOT A LOT
OF STUFFALL KINDS OF STUFF

In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
into the big room and deposit them near the TV Then they go
downstairs for another load

Steve THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACEFRANNIE THIS PLACE
IS PERFECT WE GOT IT MADE IN HEREFRANNIE

The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching

Now the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
the door again It is quiet except for the little noises of
eating and occasional rustle of paper We also head a faint
electronic whistle but we do not recognise it

As we see more of the room we find our refugees sitting near
the reconstructed pyramid on the floor Peter seems to be

up against the pyramid Roger is nibbling at delicacies from
Department Stores Gourmet department

Their loot is laid around them on the floor Roger as he
eats is leafing through the maintenance manual There is a
stack of tools some still in wrapping electric razors still
boxed some clothing articles the radio which also plays

cassettes There are soaps toiletries pens pencils and
notebooks flashlights cigarettes and several decks of cards
with a canister of chips The items are clearly not all
functional Some are representative of the luxuries considered
necessary by a consumer society

They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
Stephen tries to tune in Its power cable is spliced into the

leads of a bare light fixture overhead Fran cannot be seen at
first

Roger WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT ANYWAY

Steve ONLY ABOUT NINE

Roger AND NOTHING (referring to the TV)

On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo and realise that
the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set

Steve AS LONG AS WERE GETTING THE PATTERN
THAT MEANS THEYRE SENDING

stares

Roger snaps on the large battery powered radio He rolls the
dial getting nothing but static Finally he hears a signal
and tunes it in A badly modulated voice is droning through
the interference It sounds like a war correspondent sending
a signal from very far away

Radio REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA
BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA

Peters eyes suddenly blink open None of the rest of his body
moves the others do not realise he is awake The big man

at Stephen who is getting emotionally excited about their
exploits as a team

Steve WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF EM AND THEY

fq

The other men look at Peter The radio drones on with more
disaster reports

Peter YOU GET OVERCONFIDENTUNDERESTIMATE THOSE

Peter speaks in a low unemotional tone Stephen is transfixed

Peter THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER

381 We see Frans face She is listening There is no answer
audible A tear rolls down the womans cheek The radio drones

After a time Steve appears He is surprised to find the woman
awake She sits on a new blanket from the store Another is
rolled up as a pillow She wipes away her tears with her
cigarette still in her hand

Steve HEYYOU OK

The man kneels next to her not knowing what to say Stephen
sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders

Fran SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA RIGHT

She leans in to him making a final plea

Fran STEPHEN LETS JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP

Steve WE CANT HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD
Fran (angry)
WHAY DO YOU WANT A NEW SET OF FURNITURE A
FREEZER A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO WE CAN TAKE
WHAT WE NEED WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE
382 Cut to a close up of Peters face His eyes pop open

Peter SHUT THAT THING OFF

Roger clicks off the radio They listen They hear slight
sounds
coming from the fire stairs The end of the room with the
barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
screen which still shines

Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well The electronic
whistle slowly dies Silence

Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons Fran peers
around the corner to look but she still sits on the floor
Another noise The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
the steps Then footsteps on the metal stairs Slow
lumbering

The faces of the humans all tighten Peter and Roger pull their
rifles Roger makes his ready

Some thumping in the hall Steve squats down and holds Fran
The sounds are closer now The door behind the cartons clicks
but does not move More poundingthen silence

After a time the footsteps recede down the stairs
Peter SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME
Roger THEYLL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE

Peter ENOUGH OF EM WILL AND IT AINT JUST THEM THINGS
WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS AROUND

383 Fran ducks back onto her blanket She disgustedly lights
another

cigarette Steve sits next to her again

Steve FRANNIE

She doesnt respond

Steve DAMMIT FRAN YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WED

Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket

Steve COME ONGET SOME SLEEP

The woman doesnt move

Steve FRANNIE COME ON

She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and

stretches

body

among

out next to the man He puts his arm around her His hands rub
up and down her body as he curls next to her He opens her
blouse and reaches inside He closes his eyes and he seems
perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness His hand moves
under her clothing She doesnt respond at first then her

relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his

Steve IM NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN I REALLY THINK THIS
IS BETTER HELL YOURE THE ONES BEEN WANTIN TO
SET UP HOUSE

She stares off across the barren room His hands continues to
move under her blouse

In the Administration Corridor a few stray Zombies wander

the corpses on the floor One large and severely wounded
creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor It had
been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs

A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall She
lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth but she drops it
quickly repelled by its coldness She leans over and picks at
another corpse then she stands and drifts towards the mall

Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
second floor balcony We begin to hear a voice fading in over
the scene

Voice NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISMCANNIBALISM IN THE
TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
ACTIVITY THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
HUMAN THEY PREY ON HUMANSTHEY DO NOT PREY ON
EACH OTHER

We see the mall balcony now Zombies wander past the stores

Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse
Below

Voice THEY ATTACK ANDAND FEEDONLY ON WARM HUMAN
FLESH

At the mall entrances some creatures drift out into the night
Others still enter the enormous building There are not as many
as there were in the afternoon but there are certainly enough

to be threatening

Voice INTELLIGENCE SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING

POWER WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROMFROM NORMAL LIFE

Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the

department

of

store It is a strange and eerie sight The staring painted
eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
Zombies The gate rattles but does not budge

Voice THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS
BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE
THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC
EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
THIS MANNER

Frans eyes pop open the voice has awakened her She has been
asleep on the blanket

Voice THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE MOTORISED
INSTINCT

The woman looks around Morning sunlight is spilling in through
the skylights above She sits up and peers into the next area

the room The men are gone The television is playing On the
tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
reading the report

Voice THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
THEM WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS
THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS THEY
MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT

Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
the fire stairs door She looks up The skylight above the

pyramid is open She realises that the men are on the roof

At the edge of the roof Peter looks through binoculars

About a quarter of a mile away he sees the large warehouse of
a food processing chain IN the yard and in the large open
garages of the building he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
trucks parked

Steve YOU SURE WE CAN START EM
Roger YOU HAVENT SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET

Peter WELL LETS GET IT UP THERES NOT TOO MANY
OF EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN

fq

The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below

There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before and
they wander aimlessly spread out rather than in clusters

fq

The men move for the skylight

n the storage area below Fran is examining the maps in the
manual The TV still drones in a low volume The men climb
down into the room

Roger HEY FRAN

Fran I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST BUT I
DONT HAVE MY POTS AND PANS

There is a bitterness in her voice Roger laughs Steve senses
the tension Peter just straps on his equipment

Fran CAN I SAY SOMETHING

Steve SURE WHAT DP YOU MEAN

Fran IM SORRY YOU FOUND OUT IM PREGNANT BECAUSE I
DONT WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
THAN YOUD TREAT ANOTHER GUY

Steve HEY FRANNIE COME ON

Fran ANDIM NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS

They all look at her attentive now

Fran AND I WANT TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON AND I
WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS THERES
FOUR OF US OK

Steve JESUS FRAN

Peter FAIR ENOUGH
side

Fran NOW WHATS GOIN ON

Peter WERE GOIN OUT

Fran starts to say something but this time Peter cuts her off
Peter AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US

Again the woman starts to protest but Peter continues

Peter AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN

HANDLE YOURSELF THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
LEARN TO FIGHT

The big man starts back up the pyramid Roger moves to
follow him

Fran SOMETHING ELSE

The men look at her She faces Roger and Peter directly without
looking at Stephen

Fran I DONT KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO BUT I WANNA LEARN
HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER

Stephen is shocked Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes

Fran IF ANYTHING HAPPENSWEVE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
OUT OF HERE

Stephen doesnt know what to say He looks at the woman
then up at the other men

Peter SHES RIGHT FLYBOY COME ON LETS GO

Fran AND YOURE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN
Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
setting his rifle down on the cartons Then he fishes in his

pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun
He stares at the woman angry and hurt

Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter

Fran I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
IT

Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight Stephen stands
still He looks down at the floor Fran moves close to his
Fran IM SORRY STEPHEN (it is not an apology)

Steve I KNOWI KNOWITS ALRIGHT

He starts up to the skylight

Fran STEPHEN

Steve YEAH

He stops and turns to look at her Her eyes are pleading for
understanding but he is incapable of it at the moment Fran
just shrugs off whatever she was going to say and she sighs
with exasperation

Fran BE CAREFUL

Steve YEAH WELL BE ALRIGHT

He disappears through the skylight Fran stares down at the

weapon in her hands then she steps over and clicks off the
television

397 The sudden loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers
Only Stephen is on board at the controls
398 n the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
working on the wiring beneath the dashboard
399 Peter sits on the cab of another truck He tries the
complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other
controls
Then he pulls out He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
abreast of the cab Roger is working in
Peter HOW ABOUT IT
Roger GETTIN IT
400 Peter looks around The mall can be seen in the distance On
the
ground between there are a few Zombies scattered about in
little clusters None of them present any immanent danger
401 Roger sits up and is able to start his truck
Peter ILL JUST RIDE PICK UP IM NOT TOO SURE OF
THIS THING
Roger I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE LETS GO
402 The great trucks lumber away from the warehouse They pull

the

right

with

across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
roadway Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper following
the trucks as closely as he can

On the roof of the mall Fran clutches her rifle She sees the
big trucks roar up over the hill the helicopter just above
them It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
trucks as closely as it can

Along the road several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles The
creatures lumber along slowly behind

The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
malls parking lot They roar right toward the building

At one of the building entrances a cluster of Zombies is
moving in and lot of the main doors Others wander nearby in

parking lot Attracted by the sounds of the engines the
creatures turn and face the trucks

As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc Roger drives his

up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
doors Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb and

a great scraping crunch the big truck pulls directly abreast
of the building flush with the entrance The huge vehicle
crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
flying back

The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
entrance Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
doors open The doors move but cannot be opened wide enough
for the creatures to get out

The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
at its sides Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab

Overhead the whirlybird hovers very close by Now Peters big
truck pulls up alongside so that Peters passenger door is
directly abreast of the free door on Rogers cab

Peters truck also crushes one or two of the creatures but
there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab

As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck one
of the Zombies grabs hold Roger just manages to kick the
creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
lot

warehouse

The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
the big shopping centre where Fran has been watching the
action She now runs to the other side of the roof the wind
from the chopper whipping her hair

The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
it then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the

down the road

Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
pulls up beside another of the parked vans

Peter COME ON COME ON THREE MORE BABY
Roger LIKE A CHARM HUH LIKE A FUCKING CHARM

Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables

From the helicopter overhead Stephen spots something moving
around the warehouse He jockeys the chopper slightly fora
better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
of the big garage directly toward Rogers truck

In the meantime Peters truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
in The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily

Stephen swoops down with the big bird He buzzes as close as he
can to Rogers truck trying to signal the man

Roger continues to work on the cables still whooping like a
child The Zombies are very close at hand They have just
about reached the cab Stephen buzzes again Roger doesnt
notice

Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
pull out He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight

for him

The big chopper buzzes right over Peters cab then spins around
heading back for Roger

Peter looks toward the other truck He can now see the

lumbering

creatures He tries to slam the truck into gear but the
complicated shift mechanism fights him

One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
Rogers truck The man startles and tries to untangle himself

from

aims

from his cramped position under the big steering wheel He is
stuck for a moment The other creatures appear at the passenger
side of the cab where the door is open One grabs at Rogers
legs Roger kicks violently but cant get a good position He
falls lower onto the floor of the cab his body almost knotted
among the controls and the shift sticks

Peters truck starts to roll but it accelerates slowly

The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls but they do
not even flinch The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
creatures hair making them look even more frightening as they
claw at the desperate Roger

The man kicks and kicks but he cannot deliver a solid blow

his pinned position His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
for his rifle which suddenly fires as the mans fingers
inadvertently hit the trigger A shell blasts through the chest
of the lead creature but the thing pays little attention

Peters truck is starting to roll faster He heads right for
Rogers cab

fq

The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action

Now Roger has a good grip on his gun but he cannot clear the
long weapon from around the gear sticks The lead Zombie is
actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
struggling Trooper

fq

The second creature is about to claw its way in when with a
great roar Peters truck swings up and crushes it

Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombies mouth
away They are wrestling now The Zombie is weak as usual but
Roger is still hampered by the position he is in

Peter has pulled too far past the other truck He slams his rig
into reverse and backs up Now his window is in a direct line
with the open door on Rogers cab He raises his rifle and

but he cannot get a clear shot He shouts loudly trying to
overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
helicopter

Peter GET ITS HEAD UPGET ITS HEAD UP

Roger realises that Peter is outside He struggles with the
creature dropping his gun His hands manage to get a
stranglehold on the creatures neck He pushes up with all his
might The Zombies hands are clutching at the mans face Its

is

the

fingers push at the mans eyes

Peter sees the opportunity and fires The gun roars loudly

The Zombies head flies apart Remnants of blood and brain
tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the drivers window
The gummy stuff flies into Rogers face The Zombie falls limp
but Roger is still desperate The dead weight of the creature

now on top of him and the bloody wound runs Roger is frantic
He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes

creature out of the cab The mans eyes are wide with

revulsion

He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
face He is quivering in extremes of emotions

A sudden crash Roger spins The Zombie at the driver door has
smashed through the cab window with a brick Roger still
shaking dives down to the floor for his weapon

434 Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
in the way
Peter GET DOWNSTAY DOWNI GOT IT
435 Roger in his adrenalised anger sits up with his gun and
levels
off on the creature himself He fires The shell crashes
through
the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
head
Roger YOU BASTARDSYOU BASTARDS
It seems as though his mind is snapping His voice quivers as
does his body
Roger WE GOT EM BUDDYWE GOT EM DIDNT WE
436 Peter COOL IT MANGET YOUR HEAD
437 Roger WE GOT THIS BY THE ASSGOT THIS BY THE ASS
Roger is screaming He dives down to work on the jumping again
438 Peter HEY ROGGET YOUR HEAD MANCOME ON
WE GOT A LOT TO DOROGER
439 There is no response from the other truck Peter is about to

open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again
The engine of the truck roars He seems to have calmed down

in

some He looks across at Peter
Roger LETS GO BABYNUMBER TWO
Peter YOU ALRIGHT

Roger PERFECT BABYPERFECT

Roger guns the engine on his truck The big vehicle lumbers out
of the area Peter follows suit

The two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down
grade toward the road The helicopter escorts them
A few Zombies are walking up the road slowly

Rogers eyes get wider with anger He steers his big rig right
for the creatures

The front of the cab smashes into two of them One is crushed
under the wheels the other flies back from the impact

Fran watches with anxiety She sees the two trucks pull up over
the rise with the helicopter following We hear spirited music
as the convoy approaches the mall building

The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
lot and again the chopper zooms right over the roof

Fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot

the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors The music
continues through the entire action

Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors
The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
as the trailer blocks off the entrance This time there are
still creatures alive in the immediate area They clutch at the
cab of the truck and leap at the doors

Fran watching from directly above seems inspired caught up

the bravery of the moment As she sees the creatures converging
on the truck she aims her rifle at them Before she fires
Peters rig slides next to Rogers cabs abreast

Peters truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures
One Zombie caught directly under the front wheels is still
alive and clutching at the air Several creatures jump at
Peters driver side window

Roger grabbing his gun moves to leave his truck on Peters
side but the trucks are too close His door wont open

enough to get out He rolls down his window Peter has noticed
Rogers door wont open and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
shift in order to pull away but he hears Roger shouting

Roger THE WINDOWSOPEN YOUR WINDOWYOUR WINDOW

Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window
Roger leans out his open window trying to get his weapon into
firing position One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
narrow space between the truck They are just about to reach
Roger when he fires killing the lead ghoul More Zombies move
around Rogers cab moments away from him

452 The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
converge on the cab

453 Fran her hair blowing front he chopper tries to aim her rifle
into the pack of creatures Her hair covers her eyes and she
brushes it away with irritation

Fran ROGERIN FRONT ROGERIN FRONT ROGER
She shouts over the engine noises getting very excited

454 Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
rigs Another Zombie falls

Peter FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON

Roger is still emotionally crazed He leans out of his window
in

a very vulnerable position He is whooping like a child again
as

he tries to level off another shot

Suddenly hes grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls

out the window He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on

his gun Peter leans over trying to get a shot at the
creature

but cant get a clean sight Roger grabs the window frames on

Peters door and tries to pull himself up Another creature

grabs him from behind

455 Fran watches with emotion in her eyes

Fran MONSTERS MONSTERS
She fires her gun
456 The bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke
It narrowly misses a creature Fran fires again Her shot tears
into the shoulder of the Zombie but it doesnt stop him

457 The chopper zooms very close Peter still cannot aim his rifle
but Roger using both hands brings his gun butt in an

uppercut

It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives
the

thing staggering back Then with a desperate driving motion

Roger climbs through the window of Peters cab

458 Peter pulls the big rig away even while Rogers legs still kick
out the window The Zombies grab at Rogers ankles and one
manages to hold on as the truck starts to move

459 Fran fires again and again

460 This shot rips into the Zombie holding Rogers leg It lets go
and falls rolling across the pavement The woman fires again
hitting the pavement The creature struggles to its knees She
fires again and hits the creatures neck Again

Shoulder Againhead The Zombie sprawls on the pavement

Fran
is exultant she aims and fires at another creature

461 The helicopter passes overhead The music is still stirring

462 In Peters truck just rolling out the lot Roger realises

Roger JESUS
Peter WHAT

Roger MY GODDAM BAGI LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
OTHER TRUCK

Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt

Peter ALRIGHT NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH YOU
BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN HEAD ON BABY

Roger YEAH YEAHIM OK LETS GO

Suddenly Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
him back against the door of the cab

Peter I MEAN IT NOW YOURE NOT JUST PLAYIN WITH
YOUR LIFE YOUR PLAYIN WITH MINE

The two men stare at each other for a moment Roger is startled
somewhat out of his emotional rush

rifle

Peter (softer)
ALRIGHT NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT

Roger YEAH

Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel He guns the engine
and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot

When Fran sees the truck returning she looks up from her gun
sight The helicopter has already flown over the roof and
Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadnt appeared on the
road Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen

He finally sees her and flies closer The woman waves a signal
and the chopper buzzes back over the lot

Her hair blowing wildly Fran takes up her post again her

ready She thinks a moment then begins to reload the weapon
pulling the shells from her blouse pocket

Peters truck zooms back into position colliding with some of
Zombies in the vicinity

Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
cab He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
strewn over the seat and floor

Again creatures converge on the cab area Two more come up
between the trucks several come around the front of the cab

Fran is still loading
The helicopter buzzes

As Roger climbs back through the window his pack accidentally
falls to the ground With reflex action he drops between the
cabs landing on his feet He is facing the two creatures

which are very close He reaches up and with on hand on each of
the open window frames he swings his legs up hard His kick
sends the creatures sprawling Then he bends to collect his
pack and is grabbed from behind

Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot
Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof

Roger keeps his head this time His first thought is for the
pack of tools He tosses the sack into the cab of Peters truck

as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball

Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and

his

his

the

onto the floor of the cab

The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
mans imbalance from throwing the knapsack It bites at the
mans arm Roger tears away but blood appears at the wound
Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombies jaw
The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
behind it Roger jumps making a grab for the window of Peters
cab The Zombies between the trucks which Roger originally
kicked away have regrouped They advance and grab at the
struggling trooper Rogers feet try to get hold on the side of
the door but they slip

Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Rogers hands but Roger
falls from the high window back to the pavement Peter draws

hand gun
Roger leaps again his hands catching the window frame The

Zombies are clutching at him Again he swings up his legs and
kicks the creatures off balance This time he manages to get

feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
with his free hand but another Zombie is pulling at the mans
shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs

Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
at one of the clutching ghouls It flies back and Roger is able
to pull himself higher His torso is just about through the
window when another creature grabs him

Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window so

big man drops his pistol and pulls Rogers arm with all his
might

Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle
kicking Peter starts the truck As it begins to roll away one
of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Rogers
left leg The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf
Blood appears The creature bites again and this time it comes
away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
material from Rogers trousers

Roger screams in pain and kicks violently The truck
accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear

It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops
Then it sits on the ground looking like a gorilla It still
has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth With its
hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
morsels

his

leg

breaths

A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie Another
tears through its shoulder It still is concerned only with its
prize

Fran is firing swearing through her teeth as the gun roars
She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head

We see it fall from her point of view on the roof Others walk
by the corpse without taking notice

The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse

As it rumbles along Roger in extreme pain is tying his belt
tightly around his leg as a tourniquet He sucks air through

teeth in anguish
Peter THATS IT
Roger BULL SHIT

Peter WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG

Roger IM DEALIN WITH ITIM DEALIN WITH IT FINE
I WONT BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT

Peter CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW
Roger YOUR DAMN RIGHT I CANDAMN RIGHT I CAN
The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his

with a torn off piece of trouser He can hardly keep from
screaming and his words come out sharply and with great

between them

Roger I STOP MOVIN THIS LEGMAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN
AGAINTHERES A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE BEFORE
YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME

The big Black man stares at his friend for a moment Then he
drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper

There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
entrances to the mall They are very close to the doors if not
completely flush Some of the glass portals can be opened not
slightly but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass

through

In the parking lot the creatures mob around the trucks

under

out

frustrated that they cannot pass into the building They clutch
and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail Some try to
climb up onto the cabs Others try to claw at the doors on the
trailers

Some creatures are crawling under the rigs When they reach the
mall doors they cannot stand so they have no leverage The
creatures inside are pushing the doors out so the Zombies

the trucks cannot push them in The doors swing both in and

so it is very clear that some access could be had by the
creatures if they were more organised

One creature having crawled under a trailer does manage to
push open a mall door The thing crawls into the building
through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit They
behave as a swarm of insects

The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures
although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
brains Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
blocks the revolving door and one of them negotiates the
rotating action and enters the concourse

Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building
They are back in the crawl space The cartons are still piled
against the firestair entrance

Peter IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
INSIDE THATS A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE

ENTRANCES

Steve WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARESOR MAYBE
SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS

Peter THE GUNS ARE FIRST GUNS AND AMMUNITION

Roger moans with pain Nearby Fran is applying a dressing to
his leg The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth The
first aid kit is open on the floor Peter crouches near his
friend He takes over from Fran He ties more strips tightly
around the wound and around the upper thigh

Peter YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT BUDDY

Roger JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT

Again the military music A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store It is

Peter His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
back Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
into his belt

492 Suddenly a Zombie charges across the room The gate to the mall
balcony is open on this store Another creature attracted by
the commotion starts through the open entrance arch

493 Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid He also has
equipment strapped onto his body He sees the charging
creature
Peter is trying to unsling his rifle Stephen conquers his fear
of the height and lets himself fall to the floor He crumples
up when he hits and rolls into a store exhibit knocking
things
flying

Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
creature Stephen regains his footing The second creature is
moving up the aisle Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
nearby exhibit It is loaded It fires with a strumming sound
and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creatures skull
and imbeds itself in a wall beyond The Zombie walks forward a
few steps before it falls

494 The men run toward the entrance arch Leaping up on an adjacent

counter top Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate
and

he swings it down fast Stephen catches the cage below and
slams

it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning
and

clawing

Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
creature outside Peter jumps down from the counter

Peter DONT TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES

OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL BULLETLL WIND UP
CHASIN US AROUND IN HERE

The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage
Stephen startles

Peter HE CANT GET THROUGHCOME ON

495 The men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
the racks of weapons He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for

sighting

Peter AINT IT A CRIME

Steve WHAT

Peter (looking through the telescope)
THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
GUNIS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT

The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
forehead of the Zombie which is thrashing against the roll
gates The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapons lethal
accuracy

Stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns

Peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts He pulls
several other rifles from the rack We recognise the firepower
in the arsenal that the two men accumulate

Other Zombies appear at the gate but they cannot break in

Peter (at the creatures)
YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE SISSIES
WE COMINAND WE READY

With a swell in the music the band of all four humans charges
out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
Department Store They all wear new double holsters containing
hand guns Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
another in hand They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
other supplies The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
supply load out of the store Peter runs pushing the cart
before him

There are only a few creatures on the balcony The dead things
turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos
Roger his hands free to shoot fires his weapon several times
at some of the creatures who are closest

The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators
The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
clutters in the area

Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the
Department Store Steve falls immediately on the gate locks
Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate He turns the
cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall

Steve fumbles with the second lock Peter faces the few Zombies
which are converging along the balcony He lift his new
Super-gun and stares through the scope The gun roars
eloquently Even its sound pronounces its power The single
shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
creatures

The man aims at another head Blam Another perfect kill Then
third Roger fires several times

Fran stands ready at the roll gate As Stephen finishes with

the
final lock the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up
Steve stands and the two roll the cage into the ceiling but
Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp

Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him

Then Steve Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any
of

the advancing creatures reach the area

503 Again the Zombies smash into the cage but the humans are
already running through the aisles of the big store

504 Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for
the
first floor The doors shut and the car starts down

Peter HOWS THE RIDE

Roger KIND BUMPY WATCH IT

The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
mans head Despite his attempt at humour the stiffness in
Rogers body evidences his pain Peter puts his hand squarely
on the Troopers shoulder

Peter LOOK HEREI

Roger I KNOW I KNOWSHUT UP

Something very serious is shared between the two men some
knowledge which we do not fully understand We do see the

kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle

505 The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
into the first floor on the big store

506 Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
than the steps themselves

507 They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
up several propane torches Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
into her back pack

and

moves

torch

is

With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter Fran holds
two torches as Stephen lights them

Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
front of him Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
sudden frenzy at seeing the humans They slam against the grid
but it holds as usual

Peter UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST
Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys The Zombies

all converge near the crouching mans side of the gate They
push and shove Fran holds one of the lit torches very close

the creatures back away cringing The lock opens and Steve
to the extreme left
Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the
Peter ALRIGHTTHE TOUGHEST PARTLL BE GETTIN

BY THESE RIGHT HERE
Steve ITS A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE
Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
concourse Several other creatures are starting toward the

Department Store Behind them about three hundred feet away

one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
truck trailer

Peter WELL BE ALRIGHT
Fran ITS TOO FAR

Peter THERES NO BACKIN OUT NOW WE GOTTA LOCK
THOSE DOORS

Fran WELL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR ITS TOO RISKY

Steve YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US
Fran THE CAR

Peter WHAT

Fran THE CAR

Outside we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the

exhibit

is

new automobile It is a sleek sporty model which looks fast
and manoeuvrable

Peter looks down at Roger
Peter YOU OK TO START IT

Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack He is cringing
with pain but he moves efficiently

The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour At the unlocked
ends the grid gives a little but still holds the creature out
Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away
Steve un-locks the middle lock

Steve ITS GOIN UP

The gate swings up with a thunderous roar The Zombies attack
but Frans torches make them hold back slightly Steve grabs
one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
with the other Fran draws a hand gun also The two fire into
the pack of Zombies One or two fall The others try to move

in but are afraid of the bright flames One gets close to Steve
but the man blasts his torch directly into its face Its hair
catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about
knocking other Zombies back

Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart
Roger holds on to the sides They crash through the scattered
pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car

There are a few creatures on the concourse on the carts path

Peter (shouting)
CLOSE THE GATECLOSE THE GATE

Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down Fran
still inside the store with one of the torches
Fran THE KEYS STEPHENTHE KEYS

Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
slams shut with a metallic crash

Fran JESUS CHRIST
Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the womans shouts He
looks back Several of the creatures have followed the cart

They advance slowly

Several have stayed with Stephen however and they approach

from

Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate
The big ring doesnt fit through the small openings

Steve YOU MOTHER
Fran KEEP EMJUST KEEP EMLOOK OUT

The Zombies at Stephens back are very close Steve lunges at
them with his torch They back off slightly

Peter COME ON MAN GET OUTA THERE

The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart A
pained Roger levels off several shots but he is very shaky

his extreme pain He manages to down one of the Zombies

Fran STEPHENFOR GOD SAKE

The woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
ghouls Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock
The Zombies converge on him

Peter seeing other creatures drawing near starts to push the

cart again he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
walking dead

The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
behind Fran tries to aim her torch closer It disarms the
Zombie for a moment Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
the think off balance Then he quickly slides the keys under
the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
lock undone

Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind This time Steves torch
is knocked flying and rolls away Fran is desperate She tries
to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill She holds
her torch high

Steve kicks and scrambles rolling on the floor The Zombies
are on him He manages to knock one or two of them to the
floor Then he fires with his pistol killing another He
crawls to the torch and grabs it the creatures clutching and
tugging at his pants and shirt

He brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies They back
away enough for him to crawl to an open space Then he

scrambles

to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car

At the exhibit Peter stops the cart There are two of the
lumbering creatures close at hand The big trooper raises his
up

rifle Roger using all his strength manages to pull himself

out of the cart He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
oncoming ghouls The super-gun scores two perfect hits

As Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform he falls and
rolls against the car The turntable carries him around toward
another creature He is struggling in pain toward the drivers
door of the vehicle

Steve who is approaching at a run sees the action

Steve WATCH IS ROGERROGER

Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the

creature

Peter

the

grabs him The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound which
is already leaking blood through its dressing Roger screams
loudly

Peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable leans across the
hood of the car His super-gun drills a hole through the
creatures skull It falls off the exhibit

Peter hurriedly comes around to Rogers side In extreme pain
the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door

helps him The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
seat Roger immediately goes to work under the dash

Zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse
Peter GET IN

He is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
platform He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of

back seat They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
are locked Roger works as quickly as he can

Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable Some fall
trying to step onto the moving disc but others manage to
struggle over to the car They smash the windows with their
hands It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
shiny new car which spins very slowly in circles

Fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism and she stands
now trying to see the action but it is out of her line of
vision She can only hear the moaning of the creatures and
pounding on the car She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
extinguishing the flame

The cars engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires
Steve ILL DRIVE IT
Roger I GOT IT

The Troopers face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
position behind the wheel He is shaking but he bites his lip
and slams the car into gear There are at least eight creatures
crawling over the car more approach The platform spins Roger
waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse The
men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
the windows The ugly and distorted faces press close against
the safety glass

Now the car pulls out quickly It rolls of the edge of the
spinning display knocking several of the creatures aside The
front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor
but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
stuck for a moment The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
car with it Then Roger gives it more gas The rear wheels spin
and finally catch

The car shoots out onto the mall floor Some of the Zombies
cling for a moment but they fall away quickly scrambling to
regain their footing and follow

The car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
crash against the columns on the concourse Roger manages to
control it and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
energy

One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
the speeding auto but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
though he were a bowling pin

Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner heads directly for
the main entrance which she can see from her position

The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
attracted by the commotion The car zooms down the concourse
easily breaking their ranks

Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
tailspin stopping just at the doors

The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively There are some
creatures inside the doors Under the van several Zombies are
struggling with the doors one is just pushing in and seems as
though it will be able to enter

Peter and Stephen slam against the door Stephen aims his torch

voice

them

directly at the crawling creatures The one in front withdraws

its arm The grotesque things writhe kick under the truck The
door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys They

are all coded he falls on the lock mechanism

Peter THATS NOT 100 BUT I DONT THINK THEYLL GET
THROUGH

Steve CANT THEY SMASH THE GLASS

Peter SAFETY STUFFPRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLETHEY GOT
NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK GIMME THE ALARMS

Steve rummages in his back pack Produces two portable battery
operated burglar alarms Peter activates the units stands them
against the base of the now locked doors As he crouches near
the glass creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
glass doors They cannot get in

Peter IM HOPIN THEYLL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
THEY CANT GET IN

The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
close to the action

The men hop back into the car it roars off with Roger still at
the wheel

Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
Zombies They fall and scatter

The car speeds down the concourse turns the corner near where
Fran watches at the Department Store game We hear Steves

on the womans walkie talkie
Steve WERE OKWE GOT IT MADEITGONNA WORK

Fran stares out through the roll cage The Zombies are
staggering weakly after the car

With another tailspin the auto pulls up at the second set of
doors The men scramble out of the back seat the Zombies

outside try to crawl under the second trailer The men shut

out easily locking the door and planting alarms They stand to
look down the concourse

The creatures seem even more spread out now

Steve HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN

and

slow

slain

he

of

Peter DUNNO NOT TOO MANY WELL GET EM EASY WE
GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WERE GOIN ON A HUNT

The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
telescope

As we see through the scope cross hairs settle on the forehead
of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall The
face is magnified distorted by the telescope The gun roars

the head in the scope explodes with red

The creature falls against a column hit squarely through the
brain We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon

It is night The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
the semis They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight A

piece of music starts to build

The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall
They pound and scratch at the doors to no avail

From inside the concourse the mob is muffled Even the
revolving door is locked now It seems the most vulnerable but
the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
glass panels and they have no tools to pound with

The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside offering
added protection Several alarm units sit atop the car They
are the early warning devices against penetration

They camera starts to dolly back the music builds We see

corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
building It is like a battlefield after a war

The humans appear on the second storey balcony Moving to the
railing looking down to the expanse of the building They are
guerrilla fighters with their weapons strapped on They have
taken the Temple The music hits a crescendo as the people look
over their spoils Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as

limps to the rails supporting himself on his arms

We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building
Zombies lie dead everywhere The humans have captures the gold

the GodsIn this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven

Peters hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor He is
drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near

the firestair

Peter WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE THERES NO DOOR FROM
THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS SO NOBODYLL
GET NOSEYAND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
PLUMBING

Steve WHY CANT WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY HELL
THEY CANT EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS

Peter IM NOT JUST WORRYIN ABOUT THEM SOONER OR
LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE LOOTERS
MAYBEI DONT WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
STAIRWAY EXISTS

They look back at the map

Peter THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS
WELL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY WELL
BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
THE WALL

The men sit huddled The large storage area is filled with
mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores but the
stuff all sits around in disarray

Behind the wall of cartons Roger seems to be sleeping but he
is sweating feverishly and his face twitches Fran has been
trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead Now she
stops leaving the cloth on the shivering head She moves out
to Stephen and Peter

Fran HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING
Peter GOOD
The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
cartons There are bottles vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall

Fran I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO

Steve YOURE DOIN FINE

Fran HIS LEG IS AWFULTHE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST
CANT WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERETRY TO FIND A MED
UNIT

Steve looks at Peter The big trooper speaks softly

Peter IVE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
THINGSNONE OF EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX

HOURS

Fran is stunned Suddenly Roger screams from behind the

cartons

trying

from

Roger PETERPETERWHERE ARE YOU
Peter RIGHT HERE BUDDY

Roger is sitting up His eyes look very dark and sunken He is
sweating even more profusely than before

Roger YEAHYEAH
He licks his lips He looks around the vast barren room
to clear his eyesight

Outside Fran sits on a carton The men are still huddled
around the spoils Roger occasional shouts from the other
room

Roger WE DID IT HUH BUDDY WE WHIPPED EM

Peter THATS RIGHT ROG

Roger DIDNT WE PETER DIDNT WE WHIP EM

Peter WE SURE DID BUDDY

Roger WE WHIPPED EM AND GOT IT ALL WE GOT IT ALL

The mans voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
storage area bouncing off barren walls

A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
are working on A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
the rear of the corridor more lumber is wedged against walls
making a frame Stephen is slamming large nails into the
framework for reinforcement On the frames face a masonite
panel is nailed into place on one side Peter works in the
corridor He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
new partition look like a finished wall

In the corridor there are power tools lying about and a vast
array of other hardware in the gardening cart Fran appears

out of the washrooms She is carrying an old can of paint which
has obviously been used

Fran THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UPIT LOOKS
PERFECT

Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
driver He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
the new wall where it butts against the corridor It is a
perfect match

Steve (to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
IT OFF

Fran NO
The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper

The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way
They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony
It is a grisly sight Fran turns away

Fran NO

She steps back through the unfinished partition leans against
the framework Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
back a gag Steve moves up behind her but she feels another
wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom Steve sets down
his hammer and follows

The woman is kneeling on the floor propped up by her hands on
the toilet seat She is vomiting Steve approaches quietly His
hand falls on her back

Fran LEAVE ME ALONEITS ALRIGHTITS MY PROBLEM
Steve FRANNIE

Fran JUST GET OUTA HERE STEPHENI DONT WANT YOU
HERE

The man doesnt move Fran reaches up taking his hand She
clutches it tightly indicating that she is not angry

Fran I DONT WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY

Another wave hits her and she wretches again She pulls her
hand back leaning over the toilet bowl

Fran PLEASE GOIM ALRIGHTPLEASE

Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room The
woman wretches but she is dry She tries to swallow Then sits
on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach She
fumbles with the flush handle depressing it The rushing water
makes an ugly sound Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
her pregnancy

Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework Peter is gazing
down the corridor at the pile of corpses

Peter THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTENWE GOTTA
CLEAN UP BROTHER

Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
balcony

Peters hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe

Peter THEYRE USUALLY ON A TIMEROPEN AT
NINELOCKED AT FOURKEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST

fq

The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open

nside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank The men stand

for a moment in awe The clean walls are lined with drawers and
doors where depositors have stored their valuables At one end

of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills The men
approach the piles of money stooping down

They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the

edges

Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack Steve looks at
him quizzically

Peter YOU NEVER KNOW BROTHER

Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit He
looks about the enormous vault

Steve DONT YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
THINKGUYS IN THE FUTUREDIGGIN THE PLACE
UP IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES
JEWELLERY MAYBE THEYLL FIGURE ITS ALL SOME
KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODSLIKE IN THE
PYRAMIDSA BURIAL CHAMBER

Peter THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS NOW

We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses The
sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
pretend to represent

At the bank Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
through the lobby

seed

realm

In the vault the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
several others already deposited The corpses lie askew their
arms and legs protruding The stacks of money are upset by the
limp action of the bodies as they roll around

A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
slowly

We see a montage Fran Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
the conquered building They drift in and out of stores picking
up various items They use shopping carts

Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department

Peter looks through a book store

Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room

Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror

Fran trims Stephens hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
the mall Barber Shop

Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store then with a bag of

she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
concourse The birds flutter flap about screeching loudly

Now the group walk along the upper balcony They look down
They still have their weapons and kits Peter is wearing a wide
brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat

The concourse is empty now of corpses but the group can hear
the moaning and thumping at the main entrances It is dark
outside the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
t

he shadows under the big trailer trucks The sound evidences
heir presence however

The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their

Fran THEYRE STILL HERE

Steve THEYRE AFTER USTHEY KNOW WERE IN HERE

Peter THEYRE AFTER THE PLACETHEY DONT KNOW
WHYTHEY JUST REMEMBER REMEMBER THAT
THEY WANNA BE IN HERE

The noise at the entrance continues eerily Fran starts to be
afraid
Fran WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY

ROOM IN HELL

Steve WHAT

Peter SOMETHIN MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL USYOU

591 Roger is screaming wildly He is sweating and his face looks
sunken with an ashen colour He thrashes about as Steve tries
to
hold him His leg is swollen almost all black His arm which
was also bitten is wrapped but oozing

Steve GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM

Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics but she drops the
vial
of serum and it shatters on the floor

Steve GET ANOTHER ONECOME ON

Roger is throwing himself about wildly Steve barely manages to
hold on Fran rushes into the other room

592 The space is starting to look like living quarters There is
furniture There are sectioned off areas with things still
packed in cartons but it is beginning to look like home

593 The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator She
takes a new vial of serum from the freezer

594 Downstairs Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
the fake wall He hears the violent screaming from above

595 He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling scrambles through
the
grill in the ceiling enters the duct Then he pulls up the
ladder and closes the grill

596 He crawls through the tight space for a few feet and drops out
of another grill into the washroom

597 He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair

598 All the while Rogers screaming can be heard Peter tramps up
the stairs several at a time

He rushes through the living space in the direction of the
screams

Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Rogers good arm The man
still thrashes wildly Steve is struggling to hold him Peter
rushes in and helps Fran drifts out of the room

After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat

Peter (to Steve) GO ONILL STAY WITH HIM

Steve leaves the area

In the living spaces Fran is sitting in a chair It is the
inflatable kind which can be collapsed like a balloon Steve
comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind
She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly She stares

off across the room

Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter He licks his
lips and tries to speak coherently

Roger YOUYOULL TAKE CARE OF ME RIGHT PETER
YOULL TAKE CARE OF MEWHEN I GO

Peter I WILL

Roger I DONT WANNA BE WALKIN AROUND LIKE THAT PETER
NOT AFTER I GOI DONT WANNA BE WALKIN AROUND
LIKE THAT

The mans eyes are terrified He looks this way and that at the
walls the ceiling at PeterHe cant focus

Roger PETER PETER

Peter WILL

Roger PETER

Peter YEAH BROTHER

Roger PETER DONT DO ITTIL YOUR SURESURE IM COMIN

GONNA TRYNOT TO COME BACK

Later the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
area A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
up to the open hatch

Stephen fiddles with the television There is a faint signal
coming in He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
stretches through the skylight A table lamp sits on a small
end table and is lit Its cable is patched into a network of
wiring which stretches about the room

Fran is unpacking things She is stacking dishes and

silverware

BLUNT

It is a very orderly scene The couple looks like a pair of
newlyweds who have just moved into a new house

On the television two men are talking a commentator and an
official of the Government The Scientist is in a suit but his
tie is rumpled and his collar open He has not shaved and he
seems very tired and nervously upset

shouting as we did JAS earlier

A great outcry is heard in the studio The camera bobbles
around The scientist is fumbling for words

609 Stephen GOOD GOD

610 In the other room Peter sits against a wall He can hear the
television His eyes stare straight ahead at something

Scientist IM PROPOSING THAT CERTAINNECESSARY MEASURES

ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS WHILE

The camera pulls off Peters face We see that his rifle is
stretched across his lap The TV drones on from the other room

Scientist IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE
OBP
THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION

TO PREVENT REVIVAL
We see now what Peter is staring at On the floor twenty feet
away lies the corpse of Roger Its face is covered with a
blanket It lies very still
Scientist THIS COLLECTIONTHIS COLLECTION
The mans voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
the studio The angry staff protests vigorously with
emotional language
Scientist THIS COLLECTION COULD BESTOREDRATIONED
FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY
The shouts of anger continue
IN AN ATTEMPTIN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE

Suddenly the dead Rogers foot seems to move under the blanket
Peters eyes pick up the movement immediately His hands
tighten on his weapon

Scientist THE DISSECTIONTHE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
BE CARRIED OUTCARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY

Rogers arms seem to move in slight twitching motions

THE HEADSTHE HEADS AND THE SKELETONS
WHENEVER POSSIBLECOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND
AND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS

The commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch

From the movement beneath the blanket starts to creep down off
Rogers face Peter stares with fascination and disbelief

The blanket clears the blankly staring eyesthe drooling
mouthRoger tries to sit up Peters hands click a shell into
his super-gun

Suddenly the corpse sits up It stares at Peter blankly at
first then with purposeit starts to move towards the

Trooper

who calmly raises his weapon

On the TV the commotion still rages Stephen and Fran stare at
the tube hardly believing what they see The scientist is
shouting above the din He is nervous He wipes his brow with
his sleeve

Scientist WEVE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONALUNEMOTIONAL
RATIONAL LOGICALTACTICAL TACTICAL

Steve THEYRE CRAZYTHEYRE CRAZY
Fran ITS REALLYALL OVER ISNT IT

BLAM The loud roar of Peters gun from the next room Fran
startles and falls into Stephens arms

Rogers corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
Bank vault His eyes stare with a puzzled expression The arms
and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
Renaissance Painting of hell itself There is the familiar
gunshot wound in Rogers forehead

The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
echoes through out the mall
614 A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table
Fran ADAM NO NO

The womans hands reach into frame and grab the little animal

She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers
laid

out in an unused part of the storage area

Frans stomach is big now her pregnancy evident She wipes her
brow like an exhausted housewife and shuffles back into the
living area She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
which she and Steve obviously share There is an end table near
the bed with a reading light Books lie strewn around along
with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee

615 In the sitting room we see a scene which could be comfortable
suburban The furniture is neatly arranged There is a small
portable stove which operates on bottled gas a refrigerator
and cabinets with dishes and silverware

616 There is a modern calendar on the wall which has three months
crossed off There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
stereo record player There are even decorations paintings
hung knick knacks on the tables The room almost looks like a
wealthy mans den with all the gadget-oriented affluence

617 In the Department Store Stephen wanders about He fiddles with
a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games

618 On the roof in the bright sun of early morning Peter plays
tennis against one of the shed walls Hes dressed in a new
sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers He has a
sleek new racquet slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
might His face is set in what is almost anger He attacks each
shot with determination and emotion

619 One of his shots misses the shed The ball bounces and banks
off
the lip of the roof then it tumbles over the edge

620 In the parking lot below the ball hits the pavement It
bounces

several times rolling off among the feet of the army of
Zombies

wandering this way and that through the area

621 The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances They
moan and gurgle clawing at the building There seem to be
hundreds of them all different ages sexes shapes Some
clothed some naked some wounded some almost untouched

space

Now Fran the pregnant housewife is cooking supper

The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living
The three sit around the dinner table just finishing their
supper The TV set is on but only grey snow fills the screen

and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal

Fran THERE HASNT BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS
WHY DONT YOU GIVE IT UP

Steve THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON

Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
TV She clicks it off The woman returns to the table

Steve stands up and moves to the set He clicks it back on
Peter watches the two sheepishly It is a domestic scene The
group has become a family with all the disadvantages of
comfortable living including the inability to communicate

Fran WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES

The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine The machine is
hovering over the roof of the mall

Fran is at the controls Steve sits in the passenger seat
Steve OK NOW EASYEASYBRING ER DOWN

The whirlybird starts down for the roof It is somewhat
unstable but it eases down regularly

In the cockpit a flustered Fran manages to handle the

controls

as

Steve EASYSTABILISE ITTHATS IT

The woman reacts efficiently She handles the controls better
The choppers runners are just about on the roofs surface
Steve THATS ITTHATS ITYOU GOT IT

The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles
Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephens neck

Steve YOU DID ITYOU DID IT HONYOU DID IT

at

The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy
She is bubbling

Seen from a great distance the helicopter atop the mall looks
very small Its engine dies and begins to whine

A pair of binoculars is watching the action The lenses pull
away from a pair of beady eyes

Voice THEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF

Voice SON OF A BITCH

Voice THERES TRUCKS BLOCKIN ALL THE ENTRANCES
Voice NO SWEAT

Voice WHAT DO YA THINK HIT EM NOW OR WAIT
FOR TONIGHT

Voice TONIGHT

We see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
space near the TV A voice rattles over the unit

Voice WE KNOW YOURE IN THERESEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
ON THE ROOF

Fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal Peter sits
the radio not knowing whether to send Steve listens
Voice HEY ERCOULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE
Steve is about to say something Peter stops him
Voice WERE JUST RIDIN BYWE COULD SURE USE
SOME SUPPLIESWHATS THE CHANCE US

Peter listens intently trying to read the voices inflections

Voice HOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE ANYWAYTHERES
THREE OF US COULDNT YA USE THREE MORE GUNS

Peter RAIDERS
Fran WELL THEY KNOW WERE HERE MAYBE WE SHOULD

Peter (cutting her off)
NO CHANCE
The little puppy scrambles up to Frans feet seeking

attention

moving

She picks the little dog up in her arms

Fran WELL IF THERES ONLY THREE OF THEM

Peter WHO SAYS

Theres a long silence The radio sputters static Voices are
heard but they arent speaking into the microphone They are
obviously conferring among themselves Steve starts to speak
Peter cuts him off

Peter SHHHH QUIET

He is trying to hear the muffled conversation

Fran I THINK WE SHOULD

Peter JESUS CHRIST SHUT UP AND LISTEN

More static Slight laughter is heard Steve looks into Peters
face The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without

Finally the voice again

Voice HEYYOU IN THE MALLYOU JUST FUCKED UP
REAL BAD WE DONT LIKE PEOPLE WHO DONT SHARE

Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster
Peter COME ON MANGET IT UP

Under the cover of darkness a pair of hands stores a

microphone

on a portable radio unit The radio is in a small van which is
cluttered with junk An arsenal of weapons is strewn about

We see several men and a few women huddling inside the van
They look like banditos One even wears a Mexican sombrero The
men are armed to the teeth wearing ammunition belts criss-
crossed on their chests They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
all sorts of surplus clothing

Outside in close-up shots hands turn controls on big motor-
cycles and feet stomp accelerators The bikes roar creating a

thunderous sound Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air

Peter and Stephen are running across the mall roof The roar of
the cycles can be heard in the distance

Reaching the roofs edge Peter stares off at the horizon but

sees nothing The thunder draws nearer Peter tries binoculars
Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness As the
sound swells we see the riders Their powerful bikes come

charging over a risetwothen three morethree more
more

fq

They are accompanied by two small vans There are at least
fifteen bikes The sound is deafening

Peter JUST THREE HUH

Peter WELL LETS NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR EMCOME ON

The men charge down through the skylight The roar of the
convoy can now be heard in the living space

Fran is desperate Steve rushes by her with Peter who crashes
on ahead through the door onto the firestairs

Fran WHATS HAPPENING

Steve THERES FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF EM
WERE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES

Fran STEPHEN

Steve WERE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES
THEYLL NEVER FIND US UP HERE

The man disappears through the stairway door Fran drops the
puppy which goes running after the men floppily

Fran thinks to chase the dog but instead moves to the storage
area and snatches her weapons She starts to load her rifle

Outside the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks In the
darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes The raiders
fire their guns dropping several of the creatures

The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first The raiders
leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot
Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them

The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot

Raider THEYLL SPREAD OUT COMIN AFTER US
THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN

The other bikes ride to the leaders A van pulls in and two
bikers scramble aboard through the side doors One of the women
jumps into the drivers seat and revs the engine

The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy The mob
at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat

In the mall Peter drops from the grill in the exterior

corridor

Three

He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor where he
breaks for the mall proper He is followed by Stephen

Peter (shouting)
DOWNSTAIRS FIRST

Steve OK

Peter GOT YOUR TALK BOX
Steve YEAH

Peter KEEP IS HANDY

Outside the Raiders van revs and roars towards the mall The
bikers stay at the other side of the lot engines idling Some
of them whoop and holler like American Indians

The van crashes through the advancing Zombies Several of them
are knocked flying The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab

men pile out and scramble into the truck The Zombies in the
area clutch at the raiders but they fight their way clear The
woman in the van revs the engine again Zombies claw at her
window She squeals back to the main biker group

The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
motorcycles from a good distance The raiders open fire They
too possess sophisticated weapons the barrage sets up a great
noise Several creatures fall The little van pulls up behind
the bikes The men still whoop and shout

On the floor on the mall Peter and Steve dash about slamming
roll gates down on the open stores They run desperately
through
the empty concourses They hear the din from outside

652 At the trailer cab a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
that claw at the passenger window Another man checks cables

Raider SHITITS STILL TAPED UPITS ALL READY
FOR US

The man sits at the wheel revving the engine Ghouls at
windows

653 Inside the men hear the truck starting Steve slams down the
Pharmacy gate Peter is already running to the Department
Store The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
floor aisles Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store

654 The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance A shout of
victory goes up from the raiders The Zombies at the door do

not
yet enter the mall their focus on the raiders now From other
entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot

655 Across the lot the bikers rev their engines ready to make a

run
on the building The raiders in the truck hop from the cab

They
run to the doors shooting Zombies at they move Some creatures
fall others claw at the runners One raider is brought down by
the ghouls His friends pay no attention

656 One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked
He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
mechanism The men push through the doors The little alarm
units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal

657 Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
hears the alarms go off

658 One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling He looks up and
sees Peter running by the railing upstairs He fires with his
machine gun

659 Peter dives sliding across the balcony The bullets miss him
and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below

660 Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate and makes

a

dash for the Department Store

661 The raiders spot him as well and open fire

in

Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store where he ducks
into the shadows leaving the gate open

Peter at the balcony railing levels his super-gun on the
bikers

One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound
his chest

The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peters sight

Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store
The bikers toward the building Zombies scatter on the lot
Just as the bikers are reaching the building the raider inside
rushes the doors He holds them open as the big fleet of
rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building

Steve is in awe watching from the Department Store grid

fq

The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
them The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie Then
another He manages to fight away

Peter shooting above downs the raider and one of the ghouls
The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side

concourse to regroup They make their turn close to the
Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows

Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
the big concourses Peters eyes are wide at the invasion

Upstairs Fran hears the noises She is at the top of the
firestair weapons ready On the landing below the puppy
scamper and barks Fran calls the dog but it doesnt listen

The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept Store

Raider ALRIGHTCOUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES
CHARLIEHIT THE GATESWE GOTTA GET THAT
SNIPER

The leader rolls out Others follow Peter fires and drops a
raider his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies

The action is too fast and furious Neither Peter or Steve can
see the whole layout of the concourse

when

the

The lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns A
couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs

Steve talks into his walkie talkie

Steve THEYRE COMIN UP PETERTHEYRE COMIN
UP THE STAIRS

Peter moves to another spot on the balcony

Suddenly the raiders at the Dept Store door turn a machine
gun on the roll gate locks One flies openanother

Steve runs into the store about to charge up the escalator

he realises hell be in the line of fire he runs to the
elevator hits a button and starts for the second floor

Peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony

The other takes cover Just as Peter is changing position the
lights in the building blink outthe escalators stop the

power has gone off

Upstairs Fran is alone in total darkness Below she hears the
puppy still barking She starts carefully down the steps

In the stuck elevator Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk

Steve PETERPETER
The big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
corridor ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit

he raiders on the balcony approach quickly ducking against
walls occasionally for cover

The other bikers spill into the Dept Store raiding the
counters and raping the displays They throw things into sacks
while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
locks They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store

The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies The
creatures charge with new vigour Some raiders fall and the
ghouls pounce on them ripping flesh with teeth and hands

-

he van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
it loading supplies into it The Zombies are everywhere but
the actions of the professional looters befuddle them

Several creatures move onto the balcony One Zombie pounces the

raider Peter shot and tears at his body

As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor Peter
opens fire killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
heart The man flies back over the railing falling to the
concourse below where Zombies attack it The other raider falls
back against the wall

Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
emergency power switch

The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall

Steve who has crawled through the escape hatch of the

elevator

open

suddenly feels the car move He grabs onto the cables but his
hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
between the wall of the shaft and the moving car

Suddenly the car stops again and Steve sees through the
escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors

He thinks to jump down but hears raiders below

Two of the big greasy bandits charge into the car They whoop
and shout as they see the open escape hatch

Steve settles back out of sight against the wall
Raider COME ON MANLETS GO

The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
into the escape hatch

The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
walls and gears A shell nicks Stephens arm but he is silent

Finally the barrage stops The raiders charge back to the
store

Other bandits battle with Zombies The men crash through
stores collecting weapons ammunition tools clothes food

Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van The
woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols Zombies
try to pound their way in but they cannot succeed

In the mall another biker drops to the Zombies They pounce
on him and start devouring his screaming body

Several creatures now wander through the Department Store
having entered from the second storey gate They move through
aisles knocking against displays One grabs a mannequin

it human throws the dummy aside roughly

The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies He
runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office Peter is

Breaking into the various empty offices the raider comes to
fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere Then he hears the
faint barking of the dog He checks the panel again by running
his hand along the edge

Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns There
are three ghouls coming He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
at a time and runs onto the balcony

Bikes roar this way and that It is a war zone

The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above
He spins and looks up He sees Peter just too late

The big Trooper in an open ceiling grid aims his super-gun
squarely at the raiders head The gun roars and the man flies

Below the raiders are starting to regroup The bikes begin to
peel out of the mall entrance one at a time

Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies

The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
driver gets ready to pull out She lowers her window and fires
point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures

The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance The
Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside The men shoot and
beat their way to the cycles One man is brought down but

manage to mount their cycles The big bikes roar out

Peter is crawling through the ductwork Just as he opens a

he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse He levels
off with his scope

He shoots one raider out of the saddle Two others get out

Regrouping in the lot the band of twenty is now seven or

One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
concourse He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance

He is the leader The one who was on the radio He whoops
victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors

Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
the back of the riders head He waits as the biker roars out
onto the lot The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
the fresh air Peters scope is locked on the riders back and
the super-gun roars The biker is blown off his machine

The bike flies into a pack of Zombies Some fall back but
others advance on the rider The man rolls over the cement
stops not dead yet He screams wildly as they move onto him
The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
away

and

the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area

Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork
Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit hits the button

Steve PETER
Peter WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU
Steve IN THE ELEVATOR
Peter LISTEN THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE
CLIMB UP TOPILL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
THE SHAFTIM COMIN
Peter starts to crawl through the ducts
Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves He
clamours up on the hand rail on the car His hands reach up and
grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
opening He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the

stops He sees the grid in the shaft wall

Suddenly the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
several Zombies dart into the car They claw at Steves legs

pull him out of the hatch He screams thrashes violently

and

In the duct Peter hears the screams He stops and listens for
moment He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor

In the elevator Steve thrashes with all his might The ghouls
try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open

close repeatedly against the creatures which block it

A Zombie bites Steves arm another bites his neck The man
scrambles to unholster his gun Although he is bleeding
profusely he finally pulls his gun and firesoncetwice

Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct He hears the pistol
shots and realises Steve is not dead He thinks about climbing

back in the grid but stops He punches at the wall violently

He is angry and confused

Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head flying
out of the elevator The doors still slam against the last
creature and Steve fires The Zombie flies back and the doors
finally close

Outside Zombies fall against the elevator doors

Inside Steve falls to the floor His neck runs red His eyes
are wide with terror He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
his hand He finds it hard to breathe

Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair The puppy runs to
meet him tails wagging and yapping He hangs his head as Fran
looks down

Fran NO NO

She runs down the steps The big Trooper catches her bodily as
she is about to charge out into the hall

Peter I HEARD HIS GUNMAYBE HES ALRIGHTWELL
WAITWELL JUST WAIT A WHILE

The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn

Zombies move through the building freely walking the halls
lumbering through the stores

Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors
As they push each other one creature inadvertently makes
contact with the elevator call button

The doors glide open Steve is standing his blood dry now
His eyes are blank as he steps forward The creatures step

TA4l

away seeing that he is no longer preyhe is among them now

The doors slam against Steve and open again Steve lumbers into
the store down the aisle Other creatures drift away

Upstairs Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously Her
face is red from crying

Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing

Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
roof She deliberately goes to fill another sack

On the mall balcony Stephens corpse walks to the Maintenance
corridor He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
fake partition Something in him remembers He moves forward
Fran ITS ALMOST LIGHTLETS GO

Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door

Fran HE DOESNT ANSWER THE RADIOITS BEEN HOURS

She starts to cry again

Fran FOR GOD SAKE YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF

I GET TO THINKIN ABOUT THIS ILL JUST GO ON
DOWN THERE AND LET THEMLET THEM

fq

The puppy suddenly growls It charges between Peters feet and
runs floppily down the steps

n the hallway Steve pounds at the fake wall Other creatures
notice and they all move toward the partition

Upstairs the pounding can be heard Peter stands stoically
Looking down into the darkness The dog barks below

Fran WHAT IS IT

Peter ITS STEPHENTHEYRE COMIN UP

With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
army of creatures

Peter slams the door He speaks quietly
Peter GO ONYOU GET OUT OF HERE
Fran PETER

Peter I SAIDGET OUT OF HERE

into

From the firestair we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
it falls victim to the creatures The sound echoes through the
barren spaces of the storage area
Fran OH JESUS PETERPLEASE

Peter I DONT WANT TO GOI REALLY DONT
YOU KNOW THAT I REALLY DONT

Suddenly the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
living space Peter stares at them He smiles slightly The
creatures advance led by Stephen

Fran starts to scream

Fran STEPHENSTEPHEN

She makes a slight move for her lover but Peter raises his
super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head

As Stephen falls Fran comes up short The act startles her
awareness Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him
Peter MOVE WOMAN

Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof

The creatures advance on Peter He backs away trying to lead
them from the skylight They crash through the living space
upsetting the carefully planned room

On the roof Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine
Peter backs into the storage room slamming the door The
creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
time The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
feast

Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof
Fran stares transfixed The blades roar up to full speed

The creatures advance toward the machine

Fran steps out onto the running board the creatures very close
now She crouches watching for a moment then looks up at the

spinning blades

She stands straight up driving her head into the spinning
blades
A headless form falls to the roof The Zombies advance

750 In a wide shot silhouetted against the dawn sky we see the
creatures huddled under the chopper blades feasting on their
last victim

The credits crawl up

Just as the credits end

the engine of the helicopter sputters

and dies
