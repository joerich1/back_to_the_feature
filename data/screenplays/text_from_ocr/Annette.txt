EXT LOS- ANGELES HENRY’S THEATER - NIGHT

The billboards announce

THE APE OF GOD HENRY McHENRY SOLD OUT
EXT OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
Ann arrives at the opera house the modern Walt Disney Concert Hall
On the gigantic frontage
THE FOREST

ANN DEFRASNOUX
INT HENRYS THEATER BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Henry backstage pacing the corridor as he’s getting ready to go on stage
All he is wearing is a green toweling bathrobe (hood on his head) which makes him look like
a boxer before the fight—especially as he seems very concentrated and does a little dance in

front of a wall boxing the wall

But unlike any sportsman hes eating a banana and smoking a cigarette at the same time (Its
all part of his pre-show ritual)

Sporadically he seems aggressive almost angry

We hear distant impatient cheering and clapping growing
And then the intro music to Henry’s show

HENRY (mumbling)
Yes “laugh laugh laugh”
INT OPERA HOUSE ANN’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
Ann alone in her dressing room is getting ready to go on stage
Lying on the floor shes doing strange breathing exercises
ANN
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
INT HENRYS THEATER BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
The ANNOUNCER and the FEMALE STAGE MANAGER are standing behind a mike stand
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen are you ready
No No one is ever ready for a mildly offensive evening

with The Ape of God Here with his triumphal new show the
world infamous Henry McHenry
Henry crushes his cigarette and banana in an ashtray

Still in his bathrobe he enters the stage through a glass corridor full of smoke

INT HENRYS THEATER ON STAGE - NIGHT

At first we can hardly see him Because of the semidarkness on stage but mostly because of
the dense smoke emitted by smoke machines

On stage a high stool with a mike and a glass of whiskey
Henry coughing angry grabs the mike on the stool

HENRY (mumbling to himself)
This smoke shit

He loudly takes a sip of whiskey

HENRY

What is this fucking smoke supposed to mean anyway

I think Im getting allergic to it

Wish theyd use laughing gas instead would make my life easier
Or even better cyanide gas

Henry now faces the audience (the smoke dissipates) He seems ill at ease hesitant reluctant
(The public loves his unique blend of introversion and extraversion)

He takes his time hes in no hurry to make people laugh He talks into the mike his lips
touching the mike almost in a whisper

HENRY
So Im here to make you laugh tonight

AUDIENCE
Waoooh

HENRY
Yes Laugh laugh laugh
Not sure I can do it tonight

AUDIENCE
Ooooooooh

HENRY
Not sure I should even try
Making people laugh is a disgusting deceitful trick anyway
THE ZYGOMATIC RAP

HENRY

Yes

Why should I activate your ventromedial prefrontal cortex
So your fifteen facial muscles will contract

So your fucking zygomatic muscle will react

While your epiglottis half-closes your larynx

—CLAP

Yes why the fuck should I
Why should I make you

Suddenly lights music Chorus Girls
Henry sings his (rock) refrain with the Chorus Girls
LAUGH LAUGH LAUGH (A)

HENRY and CHORUS GIRLS

Laugh laugh laugh

But dont make me dont make me dont make me
Cant stand to hear you

Laugh laugh laugh

‘Cause You bore me you bore me you bore me

First Ill make you

Gasp gasp gasp

But dont worry dont worry dont worry
You probably will not

Choke choke choke

Kick the bucket kick the bucket

Kick the bucket kick the bucket

The music stops The stage goes back to semidarkness

While the audience claps and cheers Henry takes a few pages (his contract) out of one his
bathrobe pockets studies it a few seconds

HENRY

Hu hum

Well of course Ive heard the rumors too

They say my show kills

But relax see my contract

Save your breath

Says so here Mr Henry McHenry is not allowed to make the
public laugh to death

Henry pretends to hang himself with the mike
Henry stops the audiences singing with a big wave of his arm (like a conductor)

HENRY

Cant make your alveoli pop tonight

No dislocated jaws no belly explosions

However asthmatics keep your inhalers in position

OK READY LAUGH

HENRY

AUDIENCE

6C INT HENRYS THEATER ON STAGE - NIGHT

We’re back with Henry on stage He’s wiping his face with a tissue

HENRY
Yes why why did I become a comedian

SO WHY DID I BECOME A COMEDIAN

HENRY

To entertain some balding men

To bring a touch of levity to tragic times
Not me

To bring some joy to those who have none
To cast a skeptical eye toward common knowledge
Uh uh

To make you notice what youve always surely noticed
never noticing you noticed until I ask you

Have you ever noticed

Hmm sure —but not only that

To convey with a smile

these deep-seated feelings of hatred and humiliation
we all seem to be sharing when

All the Catholics hate the Muslims
And the Muslims hate the Catholics
And the Tutsis hate the Hutus
and everybody hates the Jews

The audience laughs and claps

Henry goes to the high stool to drink more whiskey

Someone in the audience yells

So why Henry

WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Yes why Henry

HENRY
Why

And the audience starts talkingsinging
SO WHY DID YOU BECOME A COMEDIAN
AUDIENCE
Yes why did you become a comedian
For the money

Henry takes a lighter and a few 100 bills from his pocket

HENRY

Oh no no

‘Cause I come from poverty and severity

And now have reached big money and obscenity

AUDIENCE

So why did you become a comedian
For the fame

For the fame

Henry starts burning the 100 bills

HENRY

Oh no no

Though fame is like a flame glorious superfluous
So nice being famous for being infamous

AUDIENCE

OK but why did you become a comedian
Fear of death

Fear of death

HENRY

Oh no no

‘Cause you see I have sympathy for the abyss
A-B-Y-S-S You illiterates

He “casts his eyes” on a woman in the first row

The lady nervously laughs

HENRY
Lady thats quite an abyss youve got

AUDIENCE

For the women

HENRY

EXT VIP EXIT ANNS OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Henry drives past the public coming out of the opera

As he slows down approaching the sortie des artistes he can see a crowd flashes

He parks a bit away from the crowd Still wearing his helmet he watches from a distance

Ann surrounded by admirers and photographers signing autographs She notices him and is
visibly moved

He comes down from the bike and walks towards Ann

She rushes through a few last autographs and helped by security men pushes her way
through the crowd to go meet him (in her arms a bunch of flowers offered by her admirers)

They grab each other’s hands eagerly tenderly—but with some of the awkwardness of new
lovers Henry pulls up his helmets visor and they exchange a short kiss

(Theyre both extremely shy people but deal with their shyness very differently she stays
discreet but complies politely with the basic rules of celebrity he deals with his insecurity
and anxiety by being provocative)

While the photographers are taking pictures calling their names they exchange a few words
whispering

ANN
How did the show go

HENRY
I killed them destroyed them murdered them

ANN
Good boy

HENRY
And your gig

ANN (with her shy smile)
I J Saved Them

her but she loves him so

Hes like a kid in love

PHOTOGRAPHERS

EXT FOREST AMONG CANYONS - DAY

Beauty and silence of nature (no dialog no music)

and this touching shyness between them

For a few seconds they separate he stops to light a cigarette She goes on walking slower

As he catches up with her

slow POV TRACKING SHOT towards Anns back (as shes walking)
—a feeling of sensuality (her naked neck shoulders) and menace (is he going to hit her

strangle her)

He puts his hand on her neck and they resume their walk
Now holding hands both looking in different directions they start singing

WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH

HENRY

We love each other so much
We love each other so much
We’re scoffing at logic

This wasn’t the plan

We love each other so much

And yet we remain

We love each other so much

HENRY and ANN

The song ends with their (singing) orgasm outcry

So much so much so much so much so much

INT ANN’S HOUSE BEDROOM and BATHROOM - NIGHT

After Sex Semidarkness Henry is taking a shower

Ann still in bed bites into an apple

Henry re-emerges from the bathroom in a black bathrobe He approaches Ann hands in the

air in front of him—again as if he was going to strangle her but this time playfully
impersonating a vampire in an old horror movie

HENRY
Tickling time

ANN
Hmm No no no

She tries to hide underneath the sheets but Henry jumps on the bed and starts tickling her
ANN (trying not to laugh)
Henry
No no no
Henry please not my feet not my feet

INT ANN’S OPERA HOUSE — NIGHT
Before the beginning of the opera
The musicians in the orchestra pit are tuning their instruments

Anns long-time piano accompanist (The Accompanist) is on the stage (behind the curtain)
playing the piano and singing Hes a gentle man but an ambitious one

IM AN ACCOMPANIST

THE ACCOMPANIST

I’m an accompanist I’m an accompanist

I’m an accompanist for Ann for Ann

Ann’s the one with the genius the grace

Im the one with the technical expertise

Ah the tease ah the tease of being so near so far
From the star from the stars

But someday Ill join them ‘cause

I’ma conductor I’m a conductor

I’m a conductor a conductor at heart

It’s a temp job I’m doing

This should only be seen as a means to an end

In the end in the end Ill lead orchestras near and far
Every bar every bar will bear my own signature

But I’m an accompanist for the present for Ann
That’s what I do

I’m an accompanist for the present for Ann

But now lets listen to her sing

The orchestra starts playing the dramatic intro to Anns famous “Aria”

INT HENRYS THEATER BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
The orchestral intro overlaps with images of
Henry doing his pre-show ritual (banana and cigarettes)
The operas music gives these images (already seen almost identically in Henrys first show
sequence) a whole different weight—a sort of tragic dimension
INT ANN’S OPERA HOUSE STAGE - NIGHT
The orchestra finishes the intro while the curtain slowly opens
The set is a forest at night with fake stylized trees
Ann appears beautiful spectral She starts singing
ARIA (THE FOREST)
ANN
There’s a chill in the air on this night
Where is the moon where is the starlight
Bearings lost we’re adrift on this night

Where is the moon
Where is the starlight tonight
Afraid don’t know why

Where is the moonlight

Afraid don’t know why

Where is the starlight

Afraid ‘fraid of you

Something about the look in your eyes

The back of the stage opens up on a real forest (at night)

Ann rushes toward the back of the stage

EXT REAL FOREST — NIGHT

and enters the real forest walking deeper and deeper into it as she sings cold and
frightened Is she being followed Shes not sure

ANN

Hurry dawn I need help I need light

Cut short the night I am in danger

Though I thought that I knew him I’m wrong
I don’t know him he is a stranger tonight

Afraid don’t know why
Where is the moonlight
Afraid don’t know why
Where is the starlight

Ann turns and starts to walk back towards the fake forest and the public

Afraid ‘fraid of you
Something about the look in your eyes

INT HENRY’S THEATER - NIGHT
ARIA TRANSITION

Slow motion Henry’s plays with his mikes cable as with a lasso

ARIA TRANSITION
Henry on his bike

—racing though the night in the tunnel

—close-up his face behind the helmet his eyes

INT ANN’S OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

BACKSTAGE
Henry helmet in one hand crosses a long corridor (he passes opera technicians) Anns
singing becomes clearer and louder as he approaches the stage

Its the end of the opera—the music is dramatic and poignant
Henry is getting more and more tense as if he was approaching with dread the scene of a
terrible crime

He stops near the stage (so he can see Ann performing without being seen by the public)
FINALE

ANN

Iam Love

A fickle thing a finite thing
Iam Love

Do not approach me

AAAAAAbhh

Ann appears from the back of the stage staggering stumbling towards the front of the stage
—her nightgown is soaked with blood Shes dying singing her final lines on high
heartrending notes

ANN

I was Love

A gruesome thing a gruesome thing

I was Love

But now Im dying

Dying dying dying dying dyyyyyying

The Accompanist at his piano has noticed Henrys arrival he watches Henry watch Ann

Henry watching Ann singingdying hard to know what strong feelings hes experiencing—
love and admiration for sure but also some kind of anxiety it seems

Ann is dead Thunderous applause as the curtain closes

As Ann gets ready to bow on the other side of the curtain She and Henry exchange short
intimate glances

Henry then watches Ann bow to her exulting audience on the other side of the curtain (on
control video screens)

AUDIENCE

Ann is in labor panting Henry is sweating profusely even more than his wife He seems not
just worried about the delivery but seized by deep personal angst

Nervousness (and his sense of unusefulness) makes him say something strange and
inappropriate with no intention of being funny

which sends Ann into a fit of laughter which triggers much stronger contractions

NURSE
Yes Ann yes keep on laughing thats great

INT LAS VEGAS THEATER STAGE - NIGHT

Henry exits the corridor and enters the stage coughing

AUDIENCE

HENRY (Coughing angry)
Fucking idiotic smoke

He knocks violently on the backstage door yelling at some invisible technicians
Have you no sense of proportions

Having to be funny here its like trying to enjoy a blowjob ina
gas chamber

Laughter but also a few boos

Henry takes the glass of whisky on the high stool and starts drinking

Someone in the audience shouts
That was not funny Henry

HENRY

Youre right not funny

Im so too fucking tired

I knew it I shouldve cancelled the show tonight

AUDIENCE
No no no

HENRY

Yes yes yes

You see my house was broken into last night
The bastards stole all my jokes

A few laughs But Henry seems more and more tense

HENRY

No the truth is now that I have my own soprano and baby
not sure I have it in me anymore to make sad people laugh

(He interrupts himself)

No the truth is this morning something happenedI dida

No the truth is Im sick Being in love makes me sick Sick

I didnt mean to God knows I didnt mean to
INTROSPECTIVE (B)

She woke up so beautiful She looked at me and smiled That
smile She is was a very shy person you see and I know I
knew this shy smile meant she wanted to fuck But this time I
pretended not to get it And I kept on pretending and so she
said it ever so shyly “Please Henry fuck me Henry” I could
see the effort in her smile for her to ask that to say those
dirty words to be wicked and bold So out of character
With that very shy smile I loved so much But I couldnt
answer I couldnt meet her desire Cause yes being in love
makes me sick sick I had been sleepless all night you see
suffocating suffocated by love A wreck absolutely no desire
left

Some people in the (until now deadly silent) audience start to complain

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE
Come on Henry drop it please

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE
Yeah

HENRY (Angry)
What Am I letting you know more than you care to know about
me

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE

HENRY
About her Sex Death

He lies on the floor takes off his shoes

Yes no desire left zero So I was looking for something
anything to “change the subject” to spare us both this
horrible dreadful moment of rejection Thats when the idea
came to me I remembered how extremely ticklish she is
was especially on the soles of her feet So I thought Ill

tickle her to “change the subject” So I grabbed her legs both
of her feet under my arms and started to tickle them

He vaguely pretends to tickle Ann’s feet

HENRY

I could see in her eyes she understood it all Why I was doing
what I was doing to “change the subject” and it seemed
impossible she would laugh this time She was hurt and
ashamed and sad and confused but I persisted I tickled
gently

He starts to alternately mime himself and Ann

He tickles gently tickles stronger—then throws himself on the floor and becomes Ann
Ann lying on her back fighting him not wanting to laugh starting to laugh a little

HENRY (with a womans voice)
Stop it Henry

It wasnt working So I tickled stronger
I tickled madly I tickled wild

The whole performance (the miming the female laughter coming out of Henrys body) is
frightening—morbid sexual very upsetting The audience is stunned in dread

HenryAnns laughter gets louder faster the note higher and higher until it strikes a last
long high (soprano) note —the supreme spasm— and abruptly ends as HenryAnn drops
motionless on the floor Terrible silence (on stage now and in the audience) HenryHenry
leans over his wife panicked dazed trying to wake the inert body first gently then
shaking it wildly

HENRY

Ann ANN ANNNNNNNNNN
NO NO NO ANN ANNN ANNN
NO NO ANN NOOOOO

Thad tickled her to death

A few vague laughs a few claps hesitant boos
Henry very slowly rises his face devastated

HENRY
I then tried to kill myself the same way tickling myself

He vaguely mimes the act of tickling his bare feet

But it didnt work
A few scattered laughs in the deafening silence
Henry stands back up facing the audience

HENRY
This is how I killed my wife

And he bows

AUDIENCE
That was sick

Gradually the audience seems to wake up and starts to protest more and more vocally

AUDIENCE
Youre sick
Poor Ann
Poor Annette

HENRY
I sense some animosity
Am I right or is it me

An angry group starts singing

AUDIENCE

You mustve bitten
Something bitter

In your cradle
Bitten bitter cradle

HENRY
So why did I become a comedian

But now the audience in a fury answers back
Youre not Youre not Not anymore

HENRY
So why did I become a comedian

While Henry goes to an audio device in a corner of the stage

AUDIENCE
Asshole Asshole
Sick sick sick
Boo Go home

HENRY
Okay Ready Laugh

He pushes a button on the audio device we hear a (prerecorded) amplified audience singing-
laughing (as in Henrys first act)

Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Henry waves at the audience to “encourage” their boos and insults
The Announcer pushes the Chorus Girls on stage and turns off the audio device
The Chorus Girls start singing in panic

We promised that youd laugh

We promised that youd laugh laugh laugh laugh

Laugh laugh laugh

‘Cause hes Henry hes Henry—The Henry

He didnt make you choke choke choke

Kick the bucket kick the bucket kick the bucket

HENRY
OK everybody thank you very much but enough already

He throws his mike in the air (much more aggressively than in his first show)
The mike lands on a table hitting glasses and a champagne bucket

Henry leaves the stage as the audience yells its hostility and the Chorus Girls keep singing

INT COUPLES BATHROOM and BEDROOM - NIGHT

SONG

Ann drying her hair with a towel

But she didn’t want to be there
She didn’t want to be there
She didn’t want to be there at all

She had the voice of a goddess
Strings winds and horns
Inside her chest

She goes to the door opens it listens to make sure no ones near then goes to open a
drawer hidden under her bras a pack of cigarettes She takes one

Hour after hour

She would struggle
Til her voice became
Her Royal realm

She goes back to the bathroom sits down on toiletopens a window lights her cigarette

Oh she wanted just to be there
Only wanted to live there
Really wanted to live there—forever more

On the toilet she pisses and smokes

She headed west the wild direction

No longer plain no longer plump

The men were on her doorstep

Many men were on her doorstep

Her voice had brought her beauty and set her free

She throws the cigarette in the toilet wipes herself flushes the toilet washes her
hands

But she never listened to those men who came and whispered
Youre a flame to me

—a flame to me a flame to me a flame to me

She was a queen didnt need a king whod put her brand new
palace in jeopardy

—in jeopardy in jeopardy

A queen should never be a moth to a flame

Ann defeated is lying down on her bed

Ihave a wonderful gift and a beautiful child
People adore me and I adore this man
But something’s wrong

A slight noise coming from the door Ann turns and sees baby Annette in the doorway the
baby smiling is taking her first steps

Ann goes over to her shaking off her sad mood moved She stretches her arms towards the

I will haunt you Henry

For the rest of your life
Through Annette Ill haunt you
Her voice will be my ghost

Iam no longer Love

While conducting a rehearsal he takes advantage of the musical pieces slow sections to
sing a monologue

THE CONDUCTOR

THE CONDUCTOR

It’s a fast-changing world

And I am now the conductor of the city’s finest orchestra

No longer the self-deprecating accompanist from such a short
while ago

Ann would be proud of me

I do have my suspicions though about why she isn’t alive
And doubts too about something else but

Excuse me a minute

As a loud musical section begins The Conductor leads forcefully
Then when the music calms down again

THE CONDUCTOR

Henry has invited me to his place tomorrow

To discuss a matter that he says concerns Annette and Ann

As awkward as it is for me to attend anything that concerns Ann
and the future of Annette is something that concerns me

Excuse me one more time

Loud music passage again This one is louder and more energetic than the previous one The
Conductor leads forcefully then goes back into his monologue

THE CONDUCTOR

My love for Ann has never died

Neither has my regret that our affair was only an affair
I had been hoping for so long

Then at a time when she was in despair

we started an affair

But the very next week she met Henry and that was the end of it
—the end of me

Ill always regret that

I deeply miss her Her warmth her voice I miss Ann
Excuse me

Strong and brief last loud passage ending on a big final gesture of the Conductor

INT KITCHEN and LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT
Henry is pouring a drink He hands the Conductor the glass of wine
ITS NOT REALLY EXPLOITATION

HENRY

Here’s my plan my sweet conductor
We three travel ’round the world
She performs with you conducting
Backing her around the world

All the world deserves to see this
It’s our moral duty right

Well what do you think Conductor
Am I wrong or am I right

If you would consent

To be there for her

Your fame will go greater
Two hundred percent

We would tour the world
Show her to the world
Millions would go wild
Cherishing the child

THE CONDUCTOR
This is really exploitation

HENRY
No not really

The Conductor follows Henry through the living room towards the pool

THE CONDUCTOR
Sure it is
This is really exploitation

HENRY
No not really

THE CONDUCTOR
Sure it is

HENRY

You know what my future looks like
From a money point of view

With the income from performance
She could have a future too

THE CONDUCTOR
But you’re exploiting her Henry

HENRY
No not really

THE CONDUCTOR
You’re exploiting Annette

HENRY
No not really

Please make up your mind
Please make up your mind
Please conductor friend

EVERY NIGHT THE SAME DREAM
HENRY

I have the same dream every night
Every night the same dream

INT HENRYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Only the bedside lamp is on Henry sitting on the side of his bed sings while undressing He
takes sleeping pills

Adrift on an angry sea

And in a moment of rage and stupidity
kill the one I love

Ann forgive me

Ann I beg you

Ann forgive me

He lies down under the covers
LATER THAT NIGHT

Henry asleep On the other (empty) half of the bed appears Ann lying by his side awake
They don’t touch She watches Henry sleep

ANOTHER NIGHT

Only the bedside lamp is on Henry sitting on the side of his bed smoking and singing while
undressing He takes sleeping pills

HENRY

I have the same dream every night
Every night the same dream

She’s here lying by my side

An exercise in futility

He turns off the bedside lamp and goes inside the bed
Did I kill the one I loved
There’s no forgiveness
Ann I beg you
There’s no forgive

(He screams like in a nightmare)

On the other (empty) half of the bed appears Ann phantasmal She slowly rolls her body to
get closer to Henry until her body merges into Henrys

Sound of the bedroom opening (offscreen)
Ann has disappeared
The Spirit of Ann enters the room and approaches the bed The Spirit watches Henry asleep

THE CONDUCTOR

song)

The baby listens intensely and watches the Conductors fingers move across the keyboard
WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH (LULLABY)

THE CONDUCTOR

We love each other so much
So hard to explain it

So hard to explain

We love each other so much

We love each other so much
We love each other so much

EXT IN THE HILLS ABOVE LA - DUSK

A coyote howling

EXTINT ANN’S HOUSE - EVENING

Henry returns to his villa on his bike

He parks the bike and swaying walks towards the house

SO GLAD TO BE BACK HOME

HENRY
Im feeling just a little bit drunk
Im feeling just a little bit tipsy

Behind him the heavy bike slowly falls on its side
(Henry hadnt put the kickstand properly)

Shit

Where you might ask did I go
That would be none of your business

(Searching for his keys)
Where did I put my house keys

The Conductor opens the door for Henry

As always he has looked after the baby while Henry was fooling around

HENRY

So glad to be back at home

Hey Mr Conductor friend good to see you
Thanks for watching Annette

How is Annette

THE CONDUCTOR
She’s fine

Henry enters the living room where Annette is sitting on the floor in pajamas playing on a
toy piano

On his way to the kitchen bar he pats Annette on the head

HENRY

There’s my little Annette
There’s my little Annette
How’s my little Annette
How’s my little Annette

He starts pouring himself a glass of whiskey
WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH (ANNETTE)

ANNETTE
La da di da da

The baby (without any change in lighting this time) starts singing softly and shes not
singing the “Aria” but a wordless version of “We Love Each Other So Much”—the love song
Henry and Ann used to sing together

Henry stops pouring his drink listening to his daughter sing haunted

HENRYS VISIONS
Images of Ann and Henry together (holding hands fucking etc)

Henry brutally interrupts Annettes singing and gets furious at The Conductor (Annette
watches puzzled)

HENRY
How does she know that song

YOU HAD NO RIGHT

You had no right you had no right to teach her that
You had no right you had no right at all

He then takes The Conductor outside into the garden so that Annette wont hear He goes on
singing louder with rage

You had no right you had no right to teach her that
You had no right you had no right at all

That song was our song Anns and my song that was our song
That song was our song Anns song and mine

That was our song That was our song

THE CONDUCTOR

No
No Henry I wrote that song—for Ann

HENRY
What

THE CONDUCTOR
So had every right to teach it to my star pupil Annette

HENRY
Yeah bullshit

(Getting even more furious)

Youd think you were her father
Youd think you were her father
Youd think you were her father

THE CONDUCTOR
Maybe Iam
I think Iam

For once the Conductor stands up to Henry Henry almost collapses dizzy

HENRY
This can’t be true
This can’t be true

THE CONDUCTOR
Sorry Henry
You see before you came along Ann and I

HENRY

This can’t be true

Could this be true

(Leaning against a tree singing to himself)

No one must know this or Ill loose my daughter
No one must know this or Ill loose my child

Slowly he moves away from the tree and walks back towards the house as he tells the
Conductor
Let’s put Annette to bed and then go by the pool and talk it over
OK
INT ANNETTES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Henry is tucking Annette in her bed The Conductor is on the side of the bed
(Strange sight these two fathers putting their baby to bed)

Henry is about to kiss his daughters forehead but she turns her face away from him
The Conductor kneels down and whispers to Annette

CONDUCTOR
Good night Annette

The Conductor and the baby exchange a silent gaze
But Henry turns off the bedrooms light immediately

EXT AROUND THE POOL - NIGHT
The two men arrive at the pool

The pool is now derelict most of the underwater lights dont work (or only in intermittent
bursts) the surface is swamped with dead leaves and the floating toys are half deflated

The two men start slowly walking along the pool—Henry staying menacingly close to the
Conductor as if sniffing at him

HENRY
You see my friend

Suddenly he “jokingly pretends to push the Conductor into the pool
MURDER OF CONDUCTOR

THE CONDUCTOR

Henry don’t fool around

The water must be freezing

You wouldnt want me to drown would you

HENRY
I dont know
What was I about to say

CONDUCTOR

Shall we talk as you’d asked

I can’t stay can you make it fast
Not to be impolite

But it’s been a long long night

But once again Henry pretends to push the Conductor into the pool
—more brutally this time

THE CONDUCTOR

Hey Henry no

Stop fooling around

You’re quite drunk let’s both sit down
What is it you need to say

Sit down Henry Watch it hey

Henry has pulled out the chair the Conductor was about to sit on the Conductor falls down
on his back then quickly and nervously tries to get up but Henry violently drags his body
towards the pool’s edge

Henry orders him to shut up (the baby is sleeping in the house)
Shhhh

THE CONDUCTOR
This isn’t funny anymore
Not the least bit funny anymore

HENRY (Shaking him violently)
Shhhh

THE CONDUCTOR
Get your hands off me

HENRY
Shhhh

THE CONDUCTOR

Get your hands off me

What are you trying to do to me

What are you trying what are you trying to do to me
Stop it just stop it just stop it stop it stop it

Ok ok ok ok ok stop it

HENRY
Shhhh

Henry violently throws the Conductor into the pool he kneels at the edge of the pool so that
the Conductor cant escape him

When the Conductor tries to put his head out of the water Henry pushes him back under
water

THE CONDUCTOR

Henry it’s fr-freezing

Henry I’m g-going down

I wont tell a single soul

Even you can’t be this c-c-cold

So it was y-you after all
HENRY (he pushes the Conductor back under water)

No
No

THE CONDUCTOR
If only I had gotten Ann to love me more

Henry strongly punches the Conductors face
The Conductor disappears under water

HENRY
There’s so little I can do
There’s so little I can do

The Conductors body lying flat dead on the water

THE CONDUCTOR (voice over)
If only I’d gotten Ann to love me more

HENRY
There’s so little I can do

THE CONDUCTOR (voice over)
If only

HENRY
There’s so little I can do

THE CONDUCTOR (voice over)
If only

Henry grabs the Conductors leg and pulls the whole floating corpse to one side of the pool
He then pulls the corpse out of the pool and carries it further in the darkness of the garden
INTEXT ANNETTE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Henry soaked enters Annettes bedroom The baby is in bed in the dark As Henry comes
closer he sees shes awake looking at him

HENRY

Annette youre awake

They look at each other through the darkness in silence

Then calmly silently the baby pushes the magic lamp off the nightstand—the lamp breaks
on the floor

Henry distraught kneels down and starts picking up the broken glass
HENRY (whispering)

Everything will be alright now
I promise Annette

True love always finds a way
But true love often goes astray

INT POLICE STATION INTERROGATION ROOM

True love always finds a way
But true love often goes astray
Astray astray

Away away

Time going by

Henry sitting at the desk of an interrogation room in semidarkness The crude light of the
desk lamp at times hits his face (as in during his previous interrogation scene with the police

“We Are The Police’)

Hes changed quite a bit—seems older puffed face
The light goes off

The crude light hits his face again he has changed even more—heavier a beard longer hair

etc
The light goes off

INT POLICE VAN - DAY

Henry handcuffed in prison uniform seated in the back of the police van taking him to the
courthouse—a mere shadow of his former self now
EXT OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE - DAY

Flanked by police officers Henry walks towards the courthouse among the angry crowd
singing

HE IS A MURDERER

CROWD

He is a murderer he is a murderer

There is no doubt at all that

He is a murderer he is a murderer

And he must pay the price and

Whether it’s first degree or less than first degree
The point is moot to us ‘cause

Hes still a murderer and whether it’s death or jail
Well send him far far far away

You are a murderer you are a murderer

You killed the one that we all loved

Near religiously nearly religiously

No more will she die for us

Who will now die for us who will now die for us
No one can take her place but

You who despise us all you who despise us all
We will now tame break and destroy

The police officers push Henry inside an underground parking

REPORTERS
Henry over here What do you have to say
The public has the right to know

INT COURTROOM - DAY

The courtroom obviously used to be a theater or an opera house (it has an oval shape with a
balcony—now closed to the public)

The atmosphere is solemn as Henry takes the stand

CLERK (Woman with runny nose)

Please raise your right hand

Henry McHenry do you solemnly swear that you will tell the
truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you
God

(She sneezes into her handkerchief)

Truuuuth

HENRY
Yes

The truth is you remind me so much of my mother

A murmur of disapproval in the audience—and a few laughs

The Judge bangs his gavel one time

JUDGE

Mr McHenry this court wont tolerate effrontery
Clerk please once again please

CLERK

Please Henry McHenry do you solemnly swear that you will tell

the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help

you (Singing) God
Henry stays silent a few seconds—then mumbles

No
Youll kill me if I do

Again a murmur of disapproval in the audience
The Judge bangs his gavel three times

Light and sounds in the courtroom slowly fade

We can now only see Henry everyone else in the courtroom is in darkness and completely

motionless—as if time had stopped except for Henry

He stands up and walking around the silent and dark courtroom (among the lawyers people

in the audience) he starts singing

STEPPING BACK IN TIME

HENRY

Stepping back in time Id pull Ann aside
T’m so proud of you I’m so proud of you
Stepping back in time Id pull Ann aside
“I’m so happy for you I’m so happy for you”

Henry thinks he’s heard Anns voice singing But hes not sure No it cant be

HENRY
Id say Ann what gives me the most joy
Is to watch you I’m a small boy

ANN

Youre a small boy
Wide-eyed in my awe at your silken voice
I admire you never tired of you

Never be tired of you

Henry has heard Anns voice again Or is he imagining he did Bewildered he goes on
singing while his eyes search for Ann through the darkness of the courtroom

His search for Ann becomes more frantic and he finally spots her in a mirror (the real
her not her angry Spirit) high above him—standing alone at the balcony looking at him
Beautiful tender Ann Henry hasnt seen her for so long

Shes moving around the oval balcony He moves too so as not to lose sight of her as he goes
on singing

HENRY
Teary-eyed shell say

ANN and HENRY

T’m ashamed to see

That we both can’t be where we ought to be
Crying you will say

Its so sad you see

That we both can’t be who we ought to be

Stepping back in time I could step aside
Not allow my rage to be magnified

To a dangerous point where a rash act
What an impact I can’t grab back

ANN and HENRY

Now theres no more time what a shame to see
That we both can’t be where we ought to be
No theres no more time it’s so sad to see
That we both can’t be who we ought to be

THE SPIRIT OF ANN
Henry

The voice didnt come from Ann at the balcony but from a few feet behind him

Henry turns around and faces (not sweet Ann but) the angry Spirit of Ann—coming from the
dais right by the Judge (whos motionless and in the dark)
The Spirit moves closer to Henry

COURTROOM SPIRIT

THE SPIRIT OF ANN

Henry She wont be the one keeping you company in jail I will
Day after day after day

Night after night after night

INT PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY
Henry in his prisoners uniform waiting for Annettes visit in the visiting room He has aged

quite a bit

He is mumbling some incoherent logorrhea

INT PRISON CORRIDORS - DAY
A PRISON GUARD is walking through the corridors of the prison carrying Annette in his

arms She is 5 years old now—her hair longer

INT PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

Henry still mumbling

INT PRISON CORRIDORS - DAY

The Prison Guard still walking through the corridors with Annette in his arms

INT PRISON VISITING ROOM —- DAY
Henry stops his mumbling and turns towards the door through the glass panel he can see

Annette in the guards arms She is staring at him from behind the door

The guard opens the door and Annette enters the visiting room She sits on a chair in front of
Henry

At first father and daughter sit there mute and distressed
Henry is the first to break the silence

Annette Annette
Youve changed so much Annette

ANNETTES VOICE
Yes

But the voice doesnt come from where Annette is sitting
Henrys eyes focus on the other side of the room he seems to be facing a tormented vision

On the other side of the room another Annette (a real little girl in the flesh—not a puppet
anymore) is standing her back to the wall

REAL ANNETTE
Yes I have

Although her voice is a little girls voice she now speaks with the words of a penetrating
adolescent

She approaches the table where Puppet-Annette is sitting in front of Henry
She takes the place of the puppet

Silence then

ANNETTE

You too have changed

But at least youre safe here yes

You cant drink and you cant smoke here can you

HENRY
No no I cant

ANNETTE

And you cant kill here can you

(No answer from Henry She then has a shy smile)
Hum it was a joke

HENRY

Hum you are my daughter after all

No No more killing Only time “Killing Time” Have you heard
that expression

ANNETTE
No But now you have nothing to love

HENRY
Cant I love you

ANNETTE
No Not really

Henry tries not to show how hurt he is

HENRY (He looks at the clock on the wall)
Annette
We dont have long

He then starts singing—slow low
SYMPATHY FOR THE ABYSS

HENRY

Ill sing these words to you

T hope that theyll ring true
Theyre not some magic chimes
To cover up my crimes
Annette of this I’m sure
Imagination’s strong

And Reason’s song

Is weak and thin

We don’t have long

I stood upon a cliff

A deep abyss below

Compelled to look I tried

To fight it off God knows I tried
This horrid urge to look below
But half-horrified

And half-relieved

I cast my eyes

Toward the abyss the dark abyss

Henry gets up paces the cell as he goes on singing

I heard a ringing in my ears

I knew my death knell’s ugly sound
The overbearing urge to gaze

Into the deep abyss the haze

So strong the yearning for the fall
Imagination’s strong

And Reason’s song

Is weak and thin

We don’t have long

Annette violently throws her chimp plush towards her father

For the first time we see a real toughness in her expression She bangs her little fist
repeatedly on the table as she sings

Ill never sing again
Shunning all lights at night
Ill never sing again
Smashing every lamp I see
Ill never sing again
Living in full darkness
Ill never sing again
A vampire forever

HENRY
Annette—no no no
Annette Annette no

HENRY
I sang these words to you
ANNETTE
Can I forgive what you have done
I hoped that they’d ring true
And will I ever forgive mom
Imagination’s so strong
Her deadly poison I became
And Reasons song is never strong
Merely a child to exploit
Imagination is so strong
Forgive you both
And Reasons song
Or forget you both
So faint and shrill
To take that oath
I stood above
The deep abyss
To take that oath

ANNETTE (Angry)

Why should I now forgive

Why should I now forget

I can never forgive

I can never forget

Both of you were using me for your own ends
—for your own ends

Not an ounce of shame

the two of you you’re both to blame
I wish that both of you were gone
Wish you were gone

HENRY
No dont blame Ann
Wish you were gone
Annette thats wrong
Wish you were gone
No dont blame Ann
Both of you gone

For the first time Henry sees his daughter but as a real person a real little girl of flesh and
blood Father and daughter now sing in duet
Annette turns away from Henry seeming to now sing to herself

ANNETTE
But is forgiveness the sole way
HENRY
This horrid urge to look below
When all has gone so far astray
God knows I tried to fight it off
Half-horrified and half-relieved
Extract the poison from one’s heart
And from one’s soul I can’t be sure
I cast my eyes down the abyss

Annette turns to face Henry again

Forgive the two of you or not
I take this oath
Sympathy for the dark abyss
Forgive you both
I take this oath
Sympathy for the dark abyss
I take this oath
Forgive you both
Or forget you both
Don’t cast your eyes
Down the abyss
I must be strong
I must be strong

The guard steps inside the room

GUARD
Times up

Henry grabs the child hugs her She doesnt resist his embrace but doesnt commit to it either

GUARD
No contact

The guard steps in to separate them but Henry hangs onto the child

WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH melody

ANNETTE (singing sadly to her father)
Now you have nothing to love

HENRY
Why cant I love you
Cant I love you

ANNETTE
Now you have nothing to love

HENRY
Cant I love you Annette

ANNETTE
No not really Daddy its sad but its true
Now you having nothing to love

Henry lets go of the child
The guard picks her up in his arms and leaves the room with her

HENRY
Annette my Annette
Never cast your eyes down the Abyss

INT PRISON CELL CORRIDOR - DAY

Henry goes to the closed door Through the glass panel in the door he can see Annette in the
guards arms her face turned towards him

The child is getting smaller and smaller as the guard moves away in the corridor She waves
goodbye

HENRY
Goodbye Annette Goodbye Annette Goodbye Annette
Goodbye Annette Goodbye
