See

-- GRACIE HART Miss New Jersey standing next to CHERYL
FRAZIER Miss Rhode Island as MC STAN FIELDS informs everyone
that one of these two women will be the new Miss United
States and the other will be first runner up

-- Cheryl wins she begins to cry Gracie is escorted off-
stage as Stan begins to sing the Miss United States theme

-- As Cheryl begins her victory walk Gracie goes charging
back onto the stage to try and grab the crown She finally
wrests it from Cheryl knocks Miss Texas back into the crowd
and throws the crown towards the Statue of Liberty Theres
a huge explosionand then we hear the sound of APPLAUSE

EXT TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY

As Regis and Kelly lead the applause we realize the studio
audience has been watching a tape of the pageant

REGIS
I got to tell you -- that was the
wildest pageant I ever saw

KELLY
I remember I was watching at home
and thinking -- what is she doing

REGIS
That was crazy even for New Jersey

The studio audience laughs

KELLY
Of course the whole country soon
found out that Miss New Jersey was
actually FBI Agent Gracie Hart and
shed been placed in the contest to
thwart an attack on the pageant

REGIS
Its an amazing story And you can
read about it in her best-selling
book From Misdemeanors to Miss
Congeniality Here is Agent Gracie
Hart 2

And the crowd applauds as Gracie walks out on stage waving
Shes dressed well wearing stylish but casual clothes On

the way to her chair Gracie slips on purpose -- reminscient
of her falls at the pageant There are studio laughs as Gracie

sits down next to the two hosts

KELLY
Wow You look great

REGIS
Yes This is not how I picture an
FBI Agent You dont look anything
like J Edgar Hoover

GRACIE
Really Because this is his dress

REGIS
Well that explains a few things

KELLY
So Gracie how has your life changed
since that fateful day at the pageant

GRACIE
Well Ive learned to take a bit
more pride in my appearance -- before

I used to just roll out of bed and
put on whatever went with my gun
And now I like to shop a little and
I recently bought a brush

KELLY
Before this assignment did you have
any aspirations to be in a pageant

GRACIE
No way I mean when I was in Junior
High they offered all the girls a
choice between Home Economics or
Cheerleading I chose the Boys
Wrestling Team

The crowd laughs

REGIS
Oh speaking of wrestling one of my
favorite things at the pageant was
when you demonstrated that womens
self-defense technique -- could you
maybe give us a little encore 3
Regis and Kelly turns to the crowd urging Gracie on

GRACIE
You know I dont do that kind of
stuff anymore Now I have someone
who does it for me Guys

After a moment a tough no-nonsense African-American FEMALE
FBI Agent SAM FULLER comes out She doesnt look happy to
be there Shes accompanied by an equally unhappy MALE Agent
TOM JENKINS Theyre both wearing FBI sweatshirts

GRACIE (CONTD)
These are Agents Sam Fuller and Tom
Jenkins Guys do your stuff

Jenkins comes up and grabs Sam from behind

GRACIE (CONTD)
Remember the keyword is SING --
solar plexus instep nose groin

Sam kicks and hits Jenkins in all the appropriate areas He
goes down The crowd applauds

GRACIE (CONTD)
Thanks guys Therell be a little
something extra in your paychecks

The Agents head off unhappily

REGIS
I hope my wife wasnt watching that
Now Gracie as a special treat for
coming on our show we have a little
surprise for you

KELLY
Lets bring the surprise out please

CHERYL FRAZIER walks out wearing her crown accompanied by
STAN FIELDS Pageant MC as the Miss United States song plays

REGIS
I think you know these people Its
Cheryl Frazier Miss United States

Gracie is truly shocked She hugs Stan then hugs Cheryl
They jump up and down happily like two sorority sisters 4

She gets momentarily distracted by something in the magazine 16

ERIC
What do you mean why

table and leafs through it In the middle are pictures --
Gracie as a little girl assuming a karate poseGracie as
a nine-year-old wearing a badge Next to her is her mother
also showing her badge both of them smiling

The caption reads “Gracies mother Laura Hart was also an

Gracie closes the book She goes to another part of the
apartment where she has a punching bag set up with little
flowers plastic hanging off it as if its become another
piece of furniture She takes off her bathrobe revealing
frilly pajamas underneath And she puts some music on her
stereo something girly -- Tori Amos or Enya or Jewel

She puts on some boxing gloves and gets ready to go at the
bag She pushes the bag gives it a few tentative jabs

Gracie gives the bag a few more shots Now theres a little
zip in her punch And then she rears back to give a huge
shot which connects with a solid THUD

Gracie stands there for a minute frozen Then she pulls off
her glove and three of her nails fall out She screams
silently in pain and walks away from the still swinging bag

EXT NEW YORK STREET -- DAY

Gracie is on the street near Times Square filming a Public
Service announcement

GRACIE

VELEZ
Let me show you what weve been
working on

INT BRIEFING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Gracie Sam Velez and Pete are in a room with a video screen

It shows newsreel footage of Cheryl and Stan in an airport
terminal being greeted by press

VELEZ
Frazier and Fields arrive at McCarran
at 1115 greet the press wave
head to the limo

GRACIE
Whos driving the limo

VELEZ
Tom Abernathy from Sahara Limo
service Clean record no felonies
Weve questioned him six times He
doesnt know anything Then at 1220
she goes over to --

The Video Screen shows more newsreel footage from a Senior
Citizen Home with Cheryl talking to the Seniors

VELEZ (CONTD)
The Desert Sun Senior Citizen Center
for some program where seniors teach
school kids to read 31

CHERYL
I think what youre doing here is so
wonderful It shows that different
generations have so much to learn
from each other I know I learned a
lot from my Grandmother -- not how
to read but how to kill a chicken
She owned a chicken farm with my
Grandfather and even though it wasnt
something I enjoyed doing and in
fact had horrible nightmares about
for many years thereafter -- I1l
never forget the sound of their death
squawks -- if I ever had to kill a
chicken Id know how

The residents stare at her The other Agents look at Gracie

GRACIE
You have to know herHas anyone
talked to the residents

VELEZ
About what

GRACIE
Her mood Did she seem apprehensive
Did anything unexpected happen Other
than the chicken story

VELEZ
No we didnt do that

GRACIE
Maybe we should

SAM
Maybe we shouldnt

Theres clearly a bit of tension between Sam and Gracie

PETE
I get it You guys are like good
cop bad cop Cool

They both look at him

VELEZ
So she leaves and heads to the parking
lot with Stan where theyre attacked
and kidnapped A man who was visiting
his mother got this video -- 32

A grainy video comes up showing TWO HOODED figures jumping
out of a pick-up truck and fighting with Cheryl and Stan
eventually hitting them and dragging them towards their truck
The video shakes losing the action entirely at times

VELEZ (CONTD)
Doesnt do us much good All weve
got is two hooded figures the make
of the truck but no license plate

Velez hands case folders to Sam and Gracie

VELEZ (CONTD)
Tomorrow afternoon well review the
entire database

SAM
Absolutely Sir

GRACIE
What about tonight Isnt there
something we could be doing

VELEZ
I appreciate that but Ive got agents
all over the city I think your time
is better spent catching up on what
weve got so far

GRACIE
But --

VELEZ
Ive assigned Agent Foreman to you
He knows the case and he can assist
you with anything you need

PETE
Itll be a privilege Anybody hungry

Pete laughs

PETE (CONTD)
The best thing is Open Audition night

I dont know if I can get those
tickets anymore because the truth
is Janet and I broke up Last night

wanted somebody who made more money
had a more stable life but I dont
blame her -- shes so great --

Pete is starting to get emotional

I dont believe this

PETE

even tighter around Abernathys neck

ABERNATHY (CONTD)
All I know is somebody came to me a
few days before and said dont park
near the entrance and she gave me
two-hundred bucks

Gracie opens the moonroof as Abernathy drops into the car
like a ton of cement

GRACIE
She What did she look like

INT VEGAS HOTEL -- MORNING

her in disbelief

SAM

metallic white with auburn streaks --

left unsaid here You --

She points at Sam

WOMAN (CONTD)

in your frustration and only able to
express yourself physically And you --

She points at Gracie

WOMAN (CONTD)
Turn everything into a joke because
youre terrified at your lack of
identity and inability to say who
you are and what you truly care about

The Woman looks at both of them and then runs out of the
room Gracie and Sam stare at each other for a moment

GRACIE
Did she wash her hands

SAM
Not that I saw Thats one dirty
shrink

44 45

GRACIE

SAM
We go to the office and work on the
case Thanks for asking Agent Hart

GRACIE
No problem Agent Fuller So

started before you were saved by the
therapist

They start shoving each other again

SAM
Like a little girl at Halloween

As they start to fight another WOMAN enters the bathroom

Cher struggles with him then tries to leap away falling
backwards into the water where the pirate show rages People
scream and begin snapping photos and videoing the melee

Sam jumps into the water Pete follows Gracie still huffing

Velez is there with Gracie Sam and Pete The Agents are

still wet Velez is beyond furious

GRACIE
Sir it was my fault But we had a
reason --

VELEZ

No you didnt There is NO reason
anyone chases a Drag Queen down the
Strip into the moat at Treasure
Island then dives in themselves in
front of a thousand tourists

PETE
Sir maybe were blowing this out of
proportion --

VELEZ

You think so Foreman Let me show
you a little video we taped a half
hour ago This was on Channel 5

Velez pops a tape into the TV We See a shot of Gracie
and Pete diving into the water as a Reporter comments

TV REPORTER
This truly bizarre incident shocked
and amazed both tourists and natives

A LAS VEGAS NATIVE appears on screen

VEGAS NATIVE
I lived here since 53 and I thought
Id seen it all when Elvis delivered
me a pizza last week but this thing
takes the cake

Then a TOURIST in a LAS VEGAS hat is on screen
MAN IN VEGAS HAT
First I thought it was part of the
pirate show Then I kind of hoped it
was some sort of wet T-shirt contest --
His WIFE hits him

MAN IN VEGAS HAT (CONTD)
Either way Im coming back tomorrow

Sam 54

TV REPORTER
The freakish occurrence hearkens
back to an incident involving Gracie
Hart at the Miss United States
pageant

A CLIP of Gracie diving off the stage into the crowd at the
Alamo dressed in her Bavarian outfit plays

TV REPORTER (CONTD)
It was later revealed that Miss Hart
was responding to a man she thought
was an assassin As of now there
is no explanation for tonights big
splash

In the Conference Room Gracie Sam and Pete are staring at
the screen dumbfounded as Velez turns off the set

VELEZ
And thats only one channel We
havent checked the other three-
hundred It might also be on pay-per-
view

GRACIE
We just wanted to question Cher --
or someone who looks like Cher
regarding the only piece of credible
evidence thats shown up in this
investigation -- the testimony of
the limo driver --

VELEZ
Dont even --

GRACIE
Why would he park away from the
driveway Why would he say he was
paid Why --

VELEZ
-I spoke to the limo driver --

GRACIE
I know Sir Six times --

VELEZ
Seven I spoke to him today When
he filed a claim for harrassment
against the Bureau And not just
harassment Sexual entrapment 55

SAM
From Hart

Sam laughs

VELEZ
From a certain beer slinging waitress
Where he said he made false statments
out of fear and coercion And
according to your Cher he never
spoke to any limo driver anywhere
And now hes suing for harassment
and wont talk to us

SAM
(off Gracie)
Its all her fault Sir

VELEZ
Ive got fifty agents working full
time on this Hart You think youre
going to figure it out in two days

GRACIE
Sir we only have two days

PETE
Its my fault Sir I was supposed
to keep Agent Hart away from anything
dangerous -

VELEZ
Foreman -

But it’s too late Gracie has clearly heard what she wasnt
meant to

GRACIE
Hold on
(turning to Pete)
Your job was to keep me away from
anything dangerous

For a minute no one says anything Finally Velez owns up
VELEZ
It was everybodys job Agent
Matthews said we had to keep you out
of harms way

Gracie looks shocked and embarrassed 56

GRACIE
(to Sam)
Did you know about this

SAM
Can you believe it My job was

give me my own op one day But thats
never going to happen So it’s better
they fire me now

from doing whatever you were going
to do and even though youre the
worlds biggest pain in the ass
when you have an instinct its
usually a good one Because youre
a great FBI Agent

GRACIE
Eric are you nuts You put your
