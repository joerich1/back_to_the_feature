The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE

A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended It was a big game Some
kind of

championship

ONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down squealing and

hugging each other We are focused on the bench of the TEAM
TRAT

LOST Theyre very sad -- several are crying

One girl in particular (AMY) is really sobbing Shes sweat-

stained tired and just blubbering Stuffs coming out of her
eyes

in

her nose her mouth and the camera is seeing it all

The COACH a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy

particular

COACH
You quit You gave up

He KICKS a CHAIR
Now Amy is really a mess Shes crying coughing shaking
COACH (CONTD)
(right in Amys face)
You quit

The Coach storms off

COACH (CONTD)
Qutters Quitters
Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears

REVEAL

2 INT OFFICE - DAY
BEGIN CREDITS
Were in New York City Were in the conference room of a
modestly
successful cable TV station called Real TV The people are
young energetic clever Its crowded noisy -the furniture is
beaten up bulletin boards cover the walls with large index
cards

all over them
This room is not for show -- work gets done here

SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present One of them is CYNTHIA REED
Shes the boss

TERRY
(to Cynthia)
What do you think

CYNTHIA
Its horrible its depressing I
love it What else

ALICE
I want to re-pitch that pregnancy
idea Find six women early in their
pregnancies and follow them all right
through to the births

KEITH
(negative)
Yeah when all that stuff comes
out

Mixed reactions mostly negative

CYNTHIA
I have an idea
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

CYNTHIA (CONTD)
This is something Ive been thinking
about for a long time Were Real

of the station

AGREEMENT

CYNTHIA (CONTD)
So lets go real We find someone
Just a regular person someone And
we put their life on television -
live all day long

KEITH

CYNTHIA

No We go way beyond that We
dont film it and edit it and put
it on later We go on the air
live every morning and the show
goes off each night when our
subject goes to bed In between
were on live all day every day -
the same person -- for

(shrugs)
lets say a month

No one is wild for this Some hate it -- some are unconvinced
FELICIA
Thats not a show thats a

surveillance camera

GREG
You cant do that

CYNTHIA

The hell we cant Look the
beauty of being a cable
channel is we can take chances Ive
thought about this and Im
telling you I think this can
make a noise A loud one There
are twelve thousand channels
Youve got to do something that
says Look at me Hell people
look at fish tanks all day This
is people

(more firmly)
Someones real life -- an TV all day
long - live And you know what
Im doing it

Pause The others know the argument is over

GREG

This is a nice upscale pool hall A party is in progress in a
special private area -- a room upstairs lets say -- a loft
Thirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are
informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends

Its NOISY its fun its informal Its not a high-end group
By that we mean not for the most part young lawyers or
stockbrokers Theyre mostly blue-collar Community college
graduates

WE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY Hes an attractive man about thirty
Theres still something a little juvenile about him -- not
stupid just boyish

SOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation
montage things that are done at parties these days Ed is good
at this Hes not professional but hes a loosey-goosey guy
whos kind of good on camera
ED

PULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Eds
frozen image on it Cynthia is there with her bosses the
people who run the network that owns Real TV The top man is
MR SCHARLACH His deputies are MS SEAVER and MR McILVAINE
This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her
staff This is richer more corporate and formal

CYNTHIA
Hes who we want to go with

SCHARLACH
(doubt fully)
This guy

CYNTHIA
I polled my
staff The men say theyd hang
around with him and the women say
hes fuckable And one of the men
said hes fuckable

SCHARLACH
Im not
sure about the entire concept

Cynthia is frustrated

CYNTHIA
Look its not like were

burning up the airwaves

now Were running neck-and-neck
with The Gardening Channel If
people just tune in to this twice a
day for five minutes were a hit
Plus we can sell advertising every
second running at the bottom of the
screen and the beauty is this guy
doesnt even have to be good I mean
if hes good great But if he winds
up making an ass of himself better

McILVAINE
How is that better

CYNTHIA
Come on People cannot turn away
from an accident You drive by
you say Ooh I hope theres not
a head lying in the road but you
look See nobody in America
wants to be nobody This guy
wants to be famous So
basically the deal is he agrees
to drive down the highway a
hundred miles an hour blindfolded
and we get to see if his head
winds up rolling down the
highway Fun for the whole
family So lets do it

She stops waiting for approval

point in American culture

PANEL MEMBER 2
I agree What it reveals is the
absolute creative bankruptcy in
the television business What
theyre saying basically is
Were giving up We have no
ideas

PANEL MEMBER 3
Its worse than that They dont
select someone with any talent
or with something to say -- they
seem to celebrate the fact that
this guy is a boob Its a
joyous celebration of boobery

PANEL MEMBER 4
I think weve already spent far

too much time discussing this

They all agree

panelist Youve expressed some
interesting thoughts on this
subject What do you see as the
meaning if there is any of Ed
TV John

REVEAL JOHN sitting comfortably on the panel looking very
wise

JOHN
I feel that Ed is the apotheosis
of a prevailing American
syndrome It used to be that
someone became famous because
they were special Now people
are considered special just for
being famous Fame itself is
now a moral good in this country
Its its own virtue

The others NOD appreciatively as John puts a PIPE in his mouth
TV INTERVIEWS

OLD GUY
I was Eds Little League coach
He had no coordination The big
game he struck cut with the
bases loaded Then he cried like

predict failure 1 need people

see this thing turned back in the
right direction Remember this
was your baby

(to Ed)
People want to see what happens
to them now Do your mother and
step-father get back together
How does your sister handle being
alone Your feud with your
brother

SCHARLACH
In fact we have a new concept
Since your family signed
releases we can follow them on
camera even when youre not with
them We can cut around from
family member to family member
Whoevers the most exciting at
that moment

McILVAINE
And of course its another big
bonus payment for you
Pause

ED
A couple of years ago my Uncle
Roy got bit on the ass by a dog

Silence What the hell is he talking about

ED (CONTD)
So he gave me his tickets to the US
Open -- the tennis matches

They still have no idea what hes talking about

ED (CONTD)
So me and Ray we tell our
friends Watch when Andre Agassi
is gonna serve for the first
time When hes bouncing the
ball and its real quiet well
yell Whoop And youll all
hear us

Pause

SCHARLACH
I see
(he doesnt)

ED
You know what that is Its sad
I mean it was just so we could be
heard So we could stand out
from the crowd for a second So
we did it But we had nothing to
say Just Whoop Thats it
And the stupid part I mean the
really stupid part is we
thought it like elevated us
above the crowd Where the fact
is it made us stupider than the
crowd

SCHARLACH
I see

ED
Stop saying I see You dont
see Cynthia I owe you an

apology

CYNTHIA
I dont think so

ED
Yeah Because you didnt talk
me into anything Everything you
wanted me to do I wanted to do

ED

(to the camera)
Ray you were right Its like
in school I was always saying
the room was too hot the
teacher didnt like me -- but it
was me Everything thats wrong
with my life I did Okay So
now this is it My family has
problems Which are our fault
And TV is not the place to solve
them So I quit Im taking
what very little dignity Ive got
left and I quit Can someone
validate my parking

Pause SHOCK

MR SCHARLACH
Well Ed thats not really
possible

ED
All right Ill pay for the
parking Big network

Scharlach speaks carefully - gently Hes aware of the camera
He doesnt want to come off as a villain

SCHARLACH
No I mean you cant quit

Ed thinks

ED
I cant

MR SCHARLACH
(very gently)
Well no You agreed to stay on
the air as long as we asked you
to The station entered into
this on that understanding If
you had refused wed have begun
this with somebody else You
cant just change the rules in
the middle of the game son
Its not fair to us More
importantly its not fair to the
viewers Theyre interested in
you Theyve devoted hours and
days and weeks of their lives to

you
ED

Look if you dont let me out of

this Ill just Ill just

sit in my apartment all day I
wont go anywhere I wont do
anything What kind of show will
that be

MR SCHARLACH
Not too good Thats why it
states in your contract that if
you do not continue to live a
normal life youre in violation
and are liable for the stations
financial losses Ed I urge you
to reconsider I urge you on
behalf of all those people out
there whose lives have become so
entwined with yours Play fair
with them Ed

ED
All right Let them decide

He turns right to the camera

ED (CONTD)
Id like you all to do me a
favor Turn me off Just grab
the remote and change the
channel I mean basically all
youre watching now is a guy
deteriorate

smell Youre better than that
