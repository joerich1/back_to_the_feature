Final Draft

FADE IN
EXT ELECTRIC SIGN

It FILLS THE SCREEN (designed to exactly FILL THE FRAME size
of whatever ratio were shooting in) It says

251

This message will be a little cryptic to the movie audience
on an essentially BLACK SCREEN HOLD for a beat then it
changes the lights flash this sign which should explain it
to everyone

94Â°

And a slow distant ROLL OF THUNDER in the far distance now
the SOUND of media begin to come up loud under

EXT FLATBUSH AVENUE - DAY

LONG SHOT down the Avenue 400 mm lens heat waves shimmering
thousands of old people and people with children in strollers
moving restlessly about in the heat on those endless miles

of benches

The SHOT is ON SCREEN only for a beat or two then gone

EXT MOVIE HOUSE TO MACDONALDS - DAY

We are SEEING HEIDI though we dont know it yet - shes
just another pretty 175-pound Italian girl with two kids
KIMMY JIMMY about four and five years old Right now she
is a lump of browning flesh shining with oil among rows of
similar ladies (mostly thinner but all with a certain
unhealthy softness about them) laid out in rows and groups
across the sand SHOOT LOW AND LONG so heat shimmers rise
as though the heat were baking the oil out of this mob
visible suntan oil pollution Heidis transistor blasts
ROCK MUSIC into the air

FAR DISTANT THUNDER ROLLS
INTEXT SONNYS CAR - STREET - DAY

It is parked in a drab Brooklyn street Beside the car stands
SAL medium height also good-looking in an intense boyish
way His eyes dart about suspiciously the ever-watchful

Sal

There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonnys
outgoing bounciness first impression is Sonny is all bark
Sal is the bite Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit
style he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather
He even wears a hat Now matching Sals preparations inside
the car he checks his ties alignment shoots his cuffs and
is ready

Meanwhile on their car radio

huge florist box tied with ribbon Jackie is an eighteen
year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and

Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness Adidas T-shirt

from Sonny Sonny takes the florist box from him

uniform taking down the American flag from outside Past
him comes Sal carrying an attache case He passes Howard
coming toward us through the door into the bank As he passes
CAMERA

MOVING SHOT WITH SAL

as he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks

PATRICK MULVANEY Sal sits down his back to Mulvaney facing
the front door of the bank Mulvaney is on the phone

the side of Mulvaneys desk

SAL

ON MULVANEY

who is still on the phone He gestures at the sign on his
desk that says so and gestures for Sal to sit down

ON SAL

as he sits producing as he does a machine pistol which he
holds on Mulvaneys chest out of sight from others in the
bank

MULVANEY

His mouth simply stops and he stares at the gun Mulvaney
is a comic opera Irishman in his early fifties florid
cheerful bushy eyebrows he acts out everything he says

SAL
Just go on talking like nothing was

happening okay

MULVANEY
(into phone)
Listen lemme call you back

He hangs up and looks from the gun up to Sals blank hard
face To his own amazement he grins a hopeful grin that
says Like me - dont hurt me And hes embarrassed by
it As we watch his smile turns sour

HIS POV - FLASH

Sals absolutely unmoved face
TWO SHOT - SONNY AND JACKIE
Jackie moves over to Sonny

JACKIE
Sonny Im gettin real bad vibes

SONNY
Jackie - what are you talking about

JACKIE
Maybe we can take something smaller
like a Spanish grocery

SONNY
(indicating whats
happening with Sal
and Mulvaney)
Its too late - just get away from
me - dont talk to me now - go over
to your place

Jackie moves to another deposit-slips desk - takes one out
and begins to fill it out

ON TELLERS CAGE AREA

as a LADY with a BABY in a stroller moves away from the Teller
and starts to walk toward the front door DEBORAH is marking
figures on a piece of paper at lst Tellers cage

SYLVIA and MIRIAM stand behind her - their backs to Sonny
Howard who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag ina
front desk follows Lady toward the door He unlocks the
door and hands the Baby a lollipop courtesy of the bank

and she exits the bank

CLOSE - NEW ANGLE - SONNY

glancing at clock taking a sharp deep breath

SAL

staring at Mulvaney
MULVANEY
the ruins of his smile still on his face
HOWARD

straightens up from locking the door the figure of the Lady
and the Baby can be seen receding outside

SONNY

seeing that the bank is closed locked in with no customers
crosses toward the front tellers cage area carrying the
florist box As he reaches the other side he rips open the
box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto SYLVIA
BALL the teller who automatically takes the closed sign
and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself
from the rifle

SYLVIA
(holding sign in front
of her face)
Sorry this window is shut

TWO SHOT - MULVANEY AND SAL
as Mulvaney stands and yells to Sylvia
ANGLE ON BACK OF BANK REST ROOM AREA
as MARGARET an accountant comes out of the ladies room
starts to cross downstage toward her desk sees what is
happening and momentarily freezes in her tracks
SONNY
The cues have got all fucked up but hes so programmed and
ready he cant adjust so the speech he had ready comes out
now
SONNY

Okay this is a stickup Nobody

center - get in the center

Sylvia and Edna start to move toward the rear of the bank
toward Margarets desk

MULVANEY

aghast at his own outspokenness Sal holding the gun
levelled on him

MULVANEY
Okay okay we know its a stickup

SONNY
(to Jackie re Howard)
If he moves - blow his guts out
Cover him

TWO SHOT - SONNY and JACKIE
Jackie staring at the real guns turns to Sonny

JACKIE
Im sorry Sonny I cant make

Jackie starts to move toward the front door

SONNY
Hey for christs sake now

(turns to Sal)
He cant make it

SAL
Fuck him - let him out

Sonny yells out at frozen Howard

SONNY
Hey let him out

MULVANEY
(yells)
Do what the gentleman says Howard

Sonny sees that Howard is useless so he runs to Howard
grabbing the keys from him and pulls Howard along with him
to the front door Jackie unlocks the door and Jackie
with a last apologetic glance gives his gun to Sonny and
vanishes into the sweltering afternoon Sonny then frisks
Howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door
again He quickly unlocks it and shouts out at Jackie

EXT BANK - DAY

SONNY
Hey dont take the car

JACKIE
(on sidewalk)
Well howll I get home

SONNY
Take the subway We need the car
(as Jackie starts to
walk away)
Hey gimme the keys - the keys
Jackie stops fumbles for keys crosses back to Sonny with
them

JACKIE
(points to fig desk)
Sonny theres somebody under that

desk over there Im sorry
SONNY
Its okay its okay

Sonny turns into the bank once more as Jackie walks off
toward the subway pointing inside at a desk near the window
as he does to point something out to Sonny

INT BANK - DAY
Sonny re-entering the bank speaks to Howard

SONNY
Lock it

Sonny now crosses to desk that Jackie indicated as everyone
watches him as though its all in the game

SONNY
(taps loudly on top
of desk)
Hey get outta there Nobodys
gonna hurt you

JENNY a young frightened girl peeks out from under the
desk obviously afraid to reveal herself

Sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank Sal turns
so he can cover everyone Sonny turns to order Howard

SONNY
Pull the drapes

Howard doesnt move

SONNY
Pulla drapes

Howard belatedly leaps to work pulling drapes that screen

off the interior from outside The door has no drapes or
blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor
of space across the street we will always be able to see

And from which people outside will always be able to see in
As Howard finishes the task he then walks back to the huddled
group on the rear

SONNY

on his way to the back of the bank is digging into his jacket
pocket he swings around as he passes the camera that is
bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers area He
whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint
There are three cameras in all each of which he sprays

SONNY
(grinning)
No replay folks no alarms

After spraying the three cameras he has reached Mulvaneys
desk area The girls are scattering to group farther back
and Sonny and Mulvaney are heading for the vault

MULVANEY
(on cross to vault
with Sonny)
Were hip lets just get you all
fixed up and on your way

MIRIAM a young awkward overweight Jewish girl chewing

gum with nervous machine-like rapidity moving toward the
vault The gate is closed and she holds one key and Mulvaney
the other They pass Sal who now holds the others in the
bank under his gun while at the vault gate

SONNY
Okay is the vault open

MULVANEY
I can take care of that

NEW ANGLE

Mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock Sonny
quickly reaches out and grabs Mulvaneys hand and looks at
the key he has extended He explodes

SONNY
Son of a bitch

He almost hits Mulvaney with his fist

SONNY
What the fuck you tryin to do
Trip the alarm Use the spur key
Use the other one

Hes grabbed the keys from Mulvaney and holds up the key
Mulvaney was going to use were in a

VERY TIGHT TWO SHOT - MULVANEY AND SONNYS HEADS

Sonny holds the key right in the middle of the FRAME where
Mulvaney and the audience can SEE the key has a tiny
projection or spur at the end If this key is used the
spur triggers a silent alarm
MULVANEY
I must of been outta my mind

SONNY
(furious)
Well you get your mind right Im
a Catholic and I dont wanna hurt
nobody but goddamn it dont you
play no games with me Unnastand

Mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except
for the spur He shows it to Sonny Sonny nods

NEW ANGLE

as Mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate
Miriam is crying as she unlocks her side The gate swings
open Sonny shoves Mulvaney inside and as he passes Miriam
notices her tears

She just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized
chicken the tears streaming down her face

Sonny stops staring at her Mulvaney starting to open the
gate moves inside the vault impatient

MULVANEY
Okay Lets get you on your way
Miriam - open the safe

Miriam hesitates

SONNY
Whats the matter with you

MULVANEY
(to Miriam)
Come on lemme load you up

MIRIAM
There isnt any money

Sonny looks at Mulvaney alarmed

MIRIAM
They picked it up this afternoon

SONNY
No money
(moves inside the
vault)

MIRIAM
Theres only about four thousand in
singles and maybe a few hundred in
larger bills hes going to kill
us
Sonny storms into the vault
NEW ANGLE IN VAULT

as Mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show Sonny even we
can see there isnt much there Sonny searches for more
finds nothing

SONNY
This is it What am I gonna do with
this Holy shit

MULVANEY
Its all we got

SONNY
Okay dont worry about it Stick
it in the bag

At this Sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket hands
it to Miriam who opens it and puts the money into it As

he turns we see that Miriam is still staring at him
terrified and as his rifle swings around she reels back
with a little screech of terror

SONNY
Ah Jesus

SAL
Lets go Sonny

SONNY
(suddenly gentle)
What are you crying for Jesus
Christ Its not your fault theres
no money

MULVANEY
Shes afraid youre gonna shoot
(hands Sonny the bag
of money)

Sonny starts out of the vault toward the tellers area with
bag of money He speaks to Mulvaney

SONNY
What the hell would I shoot her for

Miriam follows Sonny to tellers cages gate He carries the
bag

PHONE STARTS TO RING SONNY
Answer the phone
Mulvaney crosses to his desk picks up the receiver Sal
follows him yanks receiver from one ear to the other so he
can hear conversation

SONNY
(to Miriam)
Okay open this

Miriam crosses to gate presses the necessary button and the
gate opens from them Sonny watches this carefully noting
where the buzzer button is He crosses in front of the drawer
at the first cage He tries to open the drawer

Its obviously locked

SONNY
Okay whos the head teller here

SYLVIA
I am

SONNY
Open this up

Sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer and begins
to remove the cash but Sonny grabs her hands alarmed

SONNY
Dont take it all out

He grabs a piece of paper or cardboard
CLOSE SHOT - SONNYS HANDS AND CASH IN DRAWER

He takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in
the drawer leaving the bottom single in place It is held
there by a metal clip He carefully slips the paper under

the clip and then removes the single

It is clear this is an automatic alarm - meanwhile

SONNY
Boy I cant trust a one of you I
worked in a bank I know the alarms
so dont try to fool around with me

BACK TO SHOT OF SONNY AND SYLVIA AND MIRIAM

as they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd tellers cage Sylvia
unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash but
Sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead He begins to
stuff the money into the bag Some fives packaged with
rubber bands in the drawer he holds up so Sal and all can
see them He laughs

SONNY
Decoy money right its marked
Shit

He throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around
him gaily In the background Mulvaney having finished
with the phone conversation is moving to the rear with the
rest of the girls Sonny now moves to the 3rd cages cash
drawer Mulvaney ends phone conversation and Sal moves him
over to group at vault

SONNY
(mimicking Sylvia)
This window is shut

Again the same procedure begins Sylvia unlocks the cash
drawer and Sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the
opened plastic bag that Miriam holds

SAL
Cheer up youll be the veteran of a
robbery the bank sends you a dozen
red roses you know that

At this point THE PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN SONNY
(yelling to Sal)
Sal let him answer the goddamn
phones theyre driving me crazy
Look at this chicken shit

Again Mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk again
followed by Sal Sonny yells out to Mulvaney as he crosses
to answer the phone

register
They cross toward the last drawer area Miriam is still

crying silently Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the
checks for her She drops it

SONNY
Please quit that Its not
necessary

With everything in the bag Sonny now takes the register and
starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault

MULVANEY
Can you hurry it up

BACK TO SONNY

as he moves toward the rear (Sylvia and Miriam now re-joining
other women) to get a wastebasket Accomplishing this he
starts to burn the pages of the register tearing out pages
as he does so Its smokey as hell but not burning well

He drops it smoking into the wastebasket

SONNY

SONNY
Gimme the keys to get outta here

Howard is unable to move Seeing his predicament Edna moves
to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys
Mulvaney continues with his phone conversation

ON SONNY

situation As he moves closer Howard backs away from him
frightened by his rifle Seeing that Sonny puts it down
and looks over to Sal for coverage

SONNY

close enough

being sure to hide behind the posts as he moves

MULVANEY (0S)
(on phone)
No it was the credit rating The

Sonny has now reached the front of the bank He carefully
peeks out through the closed draperies to look outside

ANGLE ON STREET - SONNYS POV

Aman in a business suit sweaty and harassed-looking is
walking from an insurance office across the street directly
toward the bank The man continues coming straight toward
them and us

REVERSE

Sonny starts to run back to get his gun from Margarets desk
Mulvaney is still on the phone

MULVANEY
It was something a couple of years
ago in St Louis I dont know

Sonny grabs the gun from the desk top and moves over to
Mulvaney

ANGLE ON DOOR AT FRONT OF BANK

The man walks straight toward the glass door already lifting
his hand to shadow his eyes so when he reaches the door
hell be able to see inside

REVERSE ON SAL AND MULVANEY

Sal brings the gun up so he can shoot the man at the same
time crabbing himself aside so he is concealed behind
Mulvaney and the desk Mulvaney sees the approaching man
and cups his hand over the phone

MULVANEY

ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR

as Sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to
the conversation and to cover Mulvaney

SONNY
The guns right on your back

MULVANEY
Give me the keys

Sonny hands him the keys
VERY CLOSE SHOT - SAL

He raises the gun and sights it now and in this moment we
should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation
on Sals part He is smiling a little and for the first
time looks happy and thats what makes him seem dangerous
Hes looking forward to an excuse to kill Its here now
survival There is something almost sexual about the way he
settles his body down behind the weapon getting ready for
the squeeze on the trigger the report the violent shove of
recoil against his muscles and sinews

In the background we see Sylvia bringing Howard a cup of
water

ANGLE ON DOOR

emphasizing the small of Mulvaneys back The man is somebody
he knows from across the street He looks worried and
mystified

MULVANEY
(unlocking door)

the group at the vault

NEW ANGLE

INSIDE LADIES ROOM

It is a little lounge sitting on a couch under the window

to her tiny transistor radio oblivious to all thats

SAL

Who is it

Sonny turns and looks out through the door Sure enough in
the window of the barbershop across the street the dim figure
of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us

He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped
in his mouth He is an old-time hard-nosed uneducated
street-wise sarcastic New York cop outspoken rude and
sentimental Right now hes a distant silhouette and a voice
on the telephone

CLOSE ON SONNY

holding the phone Listening to the voice of his death
speaking in New York accents

MORETTI (VO)
Okay Lets be reasonable and not
stupid and not get anybody hurt
You come to the front door with hands
folded on your head unnastand

down cutting off the little voice at the other end He
looks up at Mulvaney then to Sal

At this moment Jenny phone in hand is turned to him

addressing her father

JENNY
He wants to know what time you think

she is how serious grotesque and funny it all is He

takes the time to be tender with her as though she were a
not-too-bright child in the presence of a tragedy shell

SONNY
Tell him I dont know

Now Sonny turns to speak to Mulvaney

SONNY

Sonny disappears toward the back door Jenny continues her
phone conversation

JENNY

A beat of silence Realizes she cant talk

MAN (VO)

JENNY
(past embarrassment)

She hangs up and then crosses to the group by the vault
NEW ANGLE
on Sonny as he moves to Sal to reassure Sal out of some

guiltiness about trapping him in this situation His tone
apologetic almost tender
SONNY
Sal Im sorry about this But we

Sonny now turns toward Mulvaney Howard lies down head on
jacket in the vault

SONNY
(to Mulvaney)

Now you -- whats your name
MULVANEY
Mulvaney
SONNY

You and me are checking the other
ways in and out

Sal takes a position where he can cover the door and also
the girls and Howard

NEW ANGLE
as Sonny and Mulvaney move toward the rear of the bank

SONNY
Lets go to the back door
(referring to Howard)
Howd that guy get to be a guard

MULVANEY
Well they go to guard school

SONNY
To what learn how to shoot
They dont get a gun

MULVANEY
They make 105 a week to start
They fold the flag check the place
out in the morning I dont know

At some point in their move toward the rear door Sylvia
exits the Ladies room and moves back toward the group

MULVANEY
Here we are the back door

They look at it It is big black steel and seems solid
Sonny tests it

SONNY
They could shoot the lock I want
to block it so if they try comin

(puts gun aside)

He has found a big office machine a Xerox or whatever which
he now starts to push toward the door On the opposite side
Mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door Its very heavy
and they have to strain to budge it at all Meanwhile

when they kill a mother especially
if shes got young kids

Finished with the task Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney
they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group

SONNY
Youre just a nice guy Mr Mulvaney
Only dont fuck around with me you
know what I mean

MULVANEY
I dont fool around with you

Mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down At this
point all the phones are off the hooks

EXT (AERIAL) ANGLE FROM INT POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK)

As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank and cops
around car We see a small crowd being held back by a few
police still setting up barricades It is the first
indication of the crowd event it became It also sets the
geography for us but very quickly another copter swims into
view and the two circle each other The other copter --
only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter with a big camera
sticking out the open door on our side

It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank A
COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at
the TV Cameraman

BULLHORN COP
This is a restricted area You are
flying in a restricted area

The TV Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop
and as the lens hits us dead center

INT APARTMENT NEAR BANK

Though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond
it an angle of street and the bank Near the window in a
corner is a TV set and on the TV set we are seeing the shot
of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn
as seen from the TV copter A couple of Elderly Men are
sitting watching the TV set ignoring the bank which they
can see in the flesh as it were Outside we are HEARING
the copters and on the TV set likewise and the voice of
the Announcer

ANNOUNCER (VO)
police as yet have made no contact
with the bank robbers who are locked
in the bank

There is a HAMMERING at the door and the men at the TV set
barely have time to look around before several burly Cops
wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles
with telescopic slights move through the room ignoring the
men They move out onto the fire escape a couple going up
higher settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on
the front of the bank A lot of AD LIB dialogue but what
we note is the Cops as a man take a look at themselves on
the TV

EXT BANK - DAY

The FRAME is full of cop faces tough mesomorphic faces
with a layer of fat under the skin increasing as age They
have the look of cops alert curious weighing They are
city cops they dont have that old-fashioned condemnatory
expression there is an element of playfulness in their nature

the fact is they love their work which is criminals There
is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse
in everybody and a matching fury in punishing it -- which
is the action of repressing their own strongly developed
criminal unconscious These are tense funny violent and
rigidly controlled men

MORETTI is an old-line cop a lot more relaxed than the
younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI who as a
group resemble astronauts and like them hide (but do not
deny) the psychic chaos underneath

Right now they are looking at the sky We HEAR a heavy
helicopter track

We feature SHELDON the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge

who looks like an accountant and Moretti with hat and cigar
and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties In
spite of Sheldons age Moretti plays though hes a smart

kid who still needs a little help

Sheldon is getting out of a gray car wears a gray suit
Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages

The three hang around him They approach Moretti who looks
at them without moving

MORETTI
(to no one)
Here comes the FBI
(to Sheldon)
You men lookin for protection We
got all the police right here

SHELDON
Why didnt you just wait and try to
take em out there in the street
Moretti looks at him cheerfully sarcastic

MORETTI
I made an error in judgment I
thought the sons of bitches would be
overwhelmed with remorse at the sight
of a police officer And you know
somethin Nobody has said hostage
yet Unnastan

They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a
small barbershop across the street from the bank We now
sense the growing crowd standing quietly just staring not
yet knowing whats going on

NEW ANGLE

From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits
carrying all kinds of electric junk The NEW REPORTERS

They run heavily sweating martinis and cigarette smoke
they run up to Moretti and Sheldon who walk along trying
not to catch an eye

MOVING SHOT - MORETTI AND SHELDON AMONG NEWSMEN

VOICES
How many in the bank
Have they got hostages Any shots
exchanged
(Etc AD LIB)

MORETTI
No we dont know that yet This
young fella without the hat is FBI
Im Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti
M-O-R-E-double-T-I Eugene I
dont give a shit but my wife cries
if you spell it wrong

They have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights
his way inside

INT BARBER SHOP - DAY

A COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI BAKER etc
are trying to get inside

COP
-no just get hold of Al tell him
to get the catering truck over to
26th and Avenue B theres a bank
robbery in progress and big crowd
Big Tell him to bring ice cream --
I got to hang up
He hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET
PHONE BOOK Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal
business on the fringe of this affair and though hes on
duty he hardly knows whats happening on the robbery Hes
trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck
down here etc

Moretti has got the crowd cleared back so that now we SEE
why this has been chosen as a tactical command post From
here while talking on the phone Moretti can see the bank
and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance
inside

Moretti picks up the phone

MORETTI
(to phone cop)
You get the phone company

PHONE COP
Its being set up this phonell
be a direct line into the bank

Moretti is already dialing The phone is answered
INT BANK - DAY
(Re Morettis 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny)

The group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately
twelve minutes since anything last happened Sonny is seated
at Mulvaneys desk all the phones off the hooks

The rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where
Sal is keeping his eye on them

Suddenly Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on
the hooks crossing back to sit at Mulvaneys desk again

PHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up

MORETTI
Okay youre in there and were out
here What do we do now

SONNY
I told you -- keep away I dont
know what we do now

MORETTI
Awright but I wanna talk to you

MORETTI

SONNY
Im not alone

MORETTI
How many you got in there

SONNY

MORETTI
Sal Whats that for Salvatore

SONNY
Sal Hes the killer Were Vietnam
veterans so killing dont mean
anything to us you understand

A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into
Morettis hand He accepts it and holds as though he expected
it The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other
officers These sets are tuned in to each other and
throughout the movie there is a constant background talk on
these sets This is police procedure the orders are for
everyone to talk about everything If anyone has a question
has heard a rumor or a sound whatever it is immediately
responded to so that there can be the fewest possible
surprises Sample dialogue might go Did I hear a shot
Over here by the bank there was a report like a gunshot
inside Roger we heard that from the barbershop it

was inside the bank Barbershop you can see inside
Roger we heard from the barbershop it was inside the
bank Barbershop you can see inside Roger this is
the barbershop we see inside the perpetrator is moving
toward the rear of the bank Whos that guy walking through
the barricade The blue suit Yeah Off-duty
Inspector come down to see can you use him Etc They
really do use the word Perpetrator Felon etc The Cop
handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti
does during the following

MORETTI
Right -- got ya Okay so theres

MORETTI
Give me a name any name just so I

MORETTI

SONNY
So -- you want me to send one out

Sonny hangs up and moves over to Sal The rest of the group
has been trying to make out whats being said at the other
end of the conversation

SONNY
(to Sal)
He wants one

SAL
Dead or alive

SONNY
Alive

Now Sonny looks at the group

SONNY
Okay whos gonna go first

Mulvaney now stands up at his desk looks over at the group
near the vault They look back at him waiting for some

instructions

MULVANEY
Its up to you ladies

SYLVIA
Howard

They are now unified Sonny whispers something to Sal

SONNY
To show that were negotiating

SAL

All right send them the guard
SONNY

All right lets go

Sylvia takes Howard by the arms and starts to lead him toward
the front door Sal watches as they move toward front door

SAL
Cover her Sonny

Sonny moves with them toward the front door his gun aimed
at them during the walk

Finally they arrive and Howard moves toward the door by
himself But the door is obviously locked

SYLVIA
He needs the keys

Sonny gives her the keys

SAL
(from the rear)
Only one Sonny

Sonny covers Sylvia as she moves to unlock the front door
for Howard

SYLVIA
Go along Howard

ANGLE OUTSIDE DOOR

As Howard is pushed out the door by Sylvia a cop froma
nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car
where he bends Howard over the car putting his hands behind
him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him

HOWARDS POV - QUICK CUTS

About 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to
sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his
chest and head The effect is as though he is about to be
blown entirely away

ANGLE ON THE BARBER SHOP
Moretti rushes out screaming to the cop with Howard

MORETTI
Dont fire

THE RADIO NETWORK SCREAMS

RADIO VOICES
Did he say fire What fire Do we
fire or what Who fired
(Etc)

VARIOUS COPS

Confusion reigns They dont know if the perpetrator or
not since they havent yet seen Sal or Sonny Guns are
up aimed being pushed down Cops run for better vantage
points
ANGLE ON HOWARD

as Moretti reaches him He pulls the cop away from him and
starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given
the guard

ANGLE IN DOOR OF BANK

With Sylvia in doorway staring wildly at the street scene
Sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle

SYLVIA
My God Thats Howard We voted to
send him out

VARIOUS ANGLES

as the cops slowly realize their mistake They stand back
from Howard who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock
now They get him up a reluctant to believe they could
have made such a mistake

ANGLE ON TV CAMERAMAN

Near barber shop across the street jockeying trying to
focus in on him elbowing each other they yell out

CAMERAMAN
Hey Come out get in the light
Hey out where we can get a shot
huh Whos the black guy
(etc AD LIBS)
LOW ANGLE - HELICOPTER (TO AND FROM)

swings in over street to try for a shot Howard is being
taken in the direction of the barber shop

MORETTI
to Cops

MORETTI
Get him outta here

DOOR OF BANK

Sonny back in the shadows with Sylvia looking at Moretti
appalled

ON MORETTI

Behind him a mob scene Howard is being led away weeping
Photographers cops a phalanx of cops have their weapons

levelled on Sonny like a firing squad It is right on the
edge of violence of blowing up Sonny and Sylvia are in
the shelter of the doorway Moretti stands on the sidewalk
looking toward Sonny inside the bank

MORETTI
Sonny - come out here a minute

At this point he removes his jacket and drops it to the
ground showing Sonny that he is unarmed

SONNY
You got these cops outta here
Theyre comin in too close

MORETTI
Come on I want you to see something

SONNY
You want me to give up huh Look
Sals in back with the girls
Anything happens to me - one move -
and Sal gives it to them Boom boom
How do I know you wont jump me

MORETTI
I dont forget about Sal and the
boom boom room I want you to see
this

Sonny turns back to tell Sal hes going outside Moretti
stands well out in the street to reassure Sonny nobody is
going to try to jump him Sonny stares around he nudges
Sylvia out ahead of him As they edge into sight of the
Media across the street

NEWSMEN AND PHOTOGRAPHERS
Out in the light Hey Lady Youre

ANGLES - SHOWING CROWDS

straining against police lines this is where we begin to
sense the size of the event People are eating popsicles
and ice cream They are diverted and excited Sonny and
Sylvia begin to emerge CATCALLS and HOOTS of greeting

CLOSER - SONNY AND SYLVIA

as he looks around and the impact of his situation really

hits him hes not only totally surrounded hes an event

Some of the crowd CHEER him An army of Cops and guns all
levelled on Sonny

MORETTI

They dont need to hear the words they can see

Cops off

SONNY
(screaming)
Attica Attica Go ahead Blow

hulking officer

SONNY

(to the TV)
If it wasnt for you guys theyd
kill everybody and say it was me and
Sal

(to Moretti)
You tell em to put the guns down

He means it Moretti gestures to the officers to back away
lower the guns The crowd YELLS Sonny has beat the Cops

He is momentarily their hero
Its a breaking point Moretti makes a decision
MORETTI
(Cop language command
to put gun away)
All right - put the guns down

He has to YELL it twice before the Cop slowly angrily stuffs
the gun into his holster

SOUND The crowd screams

ON SONNY

hearing the Crowd APPLAUSE He turns and grins and waves to
them They SCREAM more He turns and waves to the media

Theyve been YELLING

MEDIA
Hey over here Give us a wave

It is at this point that newsman leans out a window of the
second floor of the bank quickly lowering a mike boom

Sylvia sees this above her head
ON MORETTI

unhappy looking around at Sheldon who shrugs He did what
he had to do

ON SONNY
Suddenly realizing what control he has enjoying it He
turns mockingly his left and his right profile to cameras

INT TENEMENT HALLWAY

Sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium-size dark-
haired Man who has been standing among people behind the
barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed
right across the street towards Sonny He catches everybody
so by surprise he is already on Sonny before anyone can do
more than start to yell at him to stop Sonny himself

begins to punch him and beat him viciously Cops charge in

Theres Heidi Her body lies exactly as before baking in
the sun The transistor RADIO plays she seems to be
asleep

RADIO
the leader of the pair a Vietnam
veteran Sonny Abramowicz has
demanded in return for releasing one
of the hostages that police allow
his wife to visit him at the bank
Police spokesman

Heidi sits bolt upright stares at the radio which continues
to blather on Abruptly she begins to gather up her things
her children in a characteristically scatter-brained and
hyperactive sort of way Heidi is a one woman panic she
hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio
wadded up in towels and lugging a child crying helplessly
by one elbow as though it were a handle a silhouette against
the late afternoon sun out of Fellini meanwhile on the
SOUND TRACK we are hearing her voice It is a breathless
harsh childish voice that pours out the words in a torrent

HEIDI (VO)
The transistor goes Sonny what I
couldnt believe my ears so I shut
the transistor get outta here who
needs this I say Sonny didnt do
it Its not him to rob a bank
Its not him to hurt anybody to
threaten anybody to steal or do
anything wrong Cause hes never
done nothin wrong from the day I
know him

She is stumping off into the sunset as she says these words
and we

CUT TO
EXT BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

Out of a subway crowd she struggles pulling the two kids
by the hand a very ordinary woman in a most ordinary New
York scene

me that hes with the Mafia I say
Sonny where do you get the money
youre on welfare how can you rent
a new Eldorado red you dont like

EXT HEIDIS APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
A working class block dirty shops in the first floor three
story walk-ups above Heidi appears and runs up the stoop
TWO COPS get out of a squad car where theyve been staked
out and move up to her They never really get in a word
edgewise They follow her into the hall Now as we CUT

Chaos out of cut-rate furniture stores Full of unwashed

INT BANK - BACK DOOR AREA - LATE AFTERNOON (APPROX 5 PM)

Sonny and Mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under
a trap door in the ceiling Mulvaney looks up at it

MULVANEY
Its gonna be up there

As Sonny is staring up at the trap door thinking about what
to do he hears a tiny scratching SOUND

SONNY
Whats that

Sonny tensing like an animal peers around wildly to locate
the source of the little scratching SOUND like mice at a
steel door

ON SONNY

who quickly runs back toward the desk area

ON GROUP - DESKS AREA

Sonny races back in grabs the gun from atop Mulvaneys desk
and with the cartridge in the other hand runs back toward

EXT BANK - REAR DOOR - LATE DAY

A knot of half a dozen police are working at the door Two
were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas others
were trying a nylon line to the doorknob the idea being

that if Sonny came out that way the moment he began to open
the door the cops would yank it open exposing him completely
and gun him down The cops SCREAM as the SHOT comes through
the door showering them with brick fragments They scramble
over cars over each other over fences running into other
cops who also not knowing whats happening turn and flee
running into the crowd which panics

EXT BANK DOOR - DAY

NEW ANGLE TO REVEAL THE DELIVERY BOY
guarded by a couple of cops

DELIVERY BOY
You the guy wanted the pizza

Sonny grabs bills from the wad he holds and thrusts them at
him

DELIVERY BOY

Moretti nods)

SONNY
Keep the change

As the cops reach for the money knowing its bank money
people in the crowd yell

CROWD AD LIBS
Hey over here Hey robber How

operation I dont even have a job
(Etc)

Sonny holds up the money The crowd cheers He throws the
wad of bills and it scatters in the air

The WIND is blowing now Even some cops join the ensuing
melee to gather it up

VARIOUS ANGLES

as cops move forward and try to catch the bills Some blow
into the crowd Fights break out in the crowd as they
scramble for the money The crowd breaks the barriers and
swarms after the cash Cops try to retrieve bills fist
fights arrests
MORETTI
staring at the mess
Sonny also watching the people

There is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust
at the greed unleashed Sonny angrily hurls another bundle
after the first then laughs as he watches the people
fighting

Moretti nods ironically at him Sonny turns and enters the
bank with the food The fighting goes on in the street

INT BANK - DAY
as Sonny enters carrying food

SONNY
Okay - Chow

He puts it down in front of Mulvaney on Mulvaneys desk
Mulvaney looks at it sickly As Mulvaney looks up at Sonny

SONNY
You eat it first I dont know if
they put something in it

EXT SIDEWALK NEAR BANK - DAY

Moretti Sheldon other top cops march fast-time toward the
barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that
has drawn up to the barrier It is full of white-haired
officials one of them the COMMISSIONER He has a voice
broken by whiskey cigars good food and yelling at football
games

DOLLY AT A LOW DRAMATIC ANGLE WITH MORETTI AND ETC

It looks like they may be going into action Morettis
attitude is not that subtly different now hes talking to
brass Commissioner doesnt get out he talks through window

The Commissioners hand pudgy and freckled with age covers
Morettis where it rests on the door he massages Morettis
hand fondly

COMMISSIONER
Gene -- you smilin
MORETTI
No I never smile any more
COMMISSIONER

Whattaya think we gonna kill any
civilians tonight Gene
MORETTI
I never make bets or guesses that
way Im never wrong and I never have
to pay out

COMMISSIONER
Gene Jesus what a bull he is

A lot of comfortable CHUCKLES inside the limo The

Commissioners hand lingers on Morettis -- they are fond of
each other these men linked in a relationship of a lifetime
of shared experience of attitudes of maleness -- an

accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner

of women waiting and women panting with desire men secure

in the bastion of their roles What is being passed on here
is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from
top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally
masculine society police The homosexual content of this
should not be lost it lies in the comfortable fit of their
feelings in the fact simply that they love each other

for what they share

MORETTI
So whatsa deal

COMMISSIONER
They jets comin out But dont
let em off the ground

MORETTI
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of
people

COMMISSIONER

Dont let em off the ground

MORETTI
Listen

He leans down to get close to his commissioner because hes
not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security

TIGHTER TWO SHOT - MORETTI AND COMMISSIONER

COMMISSIONER
(anticipating)
If youre right Im gonna back you a
hundred percent you know that

MORETTI
(pleasantly)
Fuck you sir - if Im right I
dont need you What I want is -
if I make an honest mistake I want
help

The Commissioner nods - presses a button and the window goes
up to keep the air conditioning in and the heat out
INT BANK - LATE AFTERNOON - APPROX 5 PM - MAIN BANK AREA

as we hear Jenny on the phone with her husband Sonny is
doing the manual of arms with his rifle

JENNY

At one point Sonny starts to show Miriam how to hold the
gun and in mock seriousness she tries to do the manual of
arms

WE DRIFT TOWARD THE BACK CONFERENCE ROOM

SYLVIA
You know you remind me of my 19-
year-old brother - only hes got his

roots out of the ground God forbid

Listen if you ever smoke marijuana

he storms outta the house You rob
a bank but you keep your body pure
is that it

SAL

SYLVIA

Sal gets up and starts to leave the room

EXT FRONT OF APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
The fire escape with the old lady and her jigsaw puzzle the

Moretti and Sheldon and staff move out into the street The
cop car is moving through police lines cops lifting
barricades aside to let it pass

LEON

Ten days I spent in Atlantic City -

drinking he didnt know where I
was who I was with I couldnt
explain why I did the things I did
So I went to this psychiatrist who
explained to me I was a woman ina
mans body So Sonny right away
wanted to get me money for a sex
change operation but where was he
to get that 2500 dollars My God
hes in hock up to his ears already

MORETTI
He needed money For the operation
for you

LEON
It made him crazy - so much demand
hed fly into this rages And I got
more depressed than ever I saw Id
never get the operation So I tried
to take my life - I swallowed about

a half pound of pills blues
reds yellows downers uppers
screamers you name it But I

just threw them up and wound up in
the hospital Sonny comes there and
looks at me and just says Wow

almost go crazy because I know hes
doin it for me

MORETTI

MULVANEY

SONNY
(grinning)

I dont think so
Sonny walks back toward Sal
SONNY
I told you -- theyre sending a jet
Its all worked out

But doubt hangs in the air like a pall

CLOSEUP - SAL
looking at him Implacable This tension between them over
the question of Sonnys loyalty must be kept constantly alive
with CUTS and looks over dialogue

SYLVIA and MULVANEY

SYLVIA
Somebody give me another cigarette

Sal turns to look at her reproachfully
ON SYLVIA

SYLVIA
I wish somebody would tell me Im

MULVANEY

Sonny exits Conference Room and moves downstage
SYLVIA
(amazed)

They think for a moment

JENNY
He said the F word

They stare at her incredulously
Someone giggles

EDNA

JENNY
The F word He did He said the
F word
Edna crosses to her desk - disgusted - and starts to tidy
up

The giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and
sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter Sonny
roars Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling After a few
seconds they force themselves to stop to behave like they
should under the circumstances They are gasping and crying
Then

SONNY
Whats so funny

EDNA
Well Im a Christian and my ears
are not garbage cans

It sets them off again They howl and giggle and laugh

Until at last they run down again At this point Sal rushes
out of Conference Room

SAL
Whos that

He has seen something in the middle of the street and now

NEW ANGLE
as they all turn to look out through the door

THEIR POV

Backlighted by the floodlights in the middle of street

EXT BANK - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT

The restless crowd STIRS sensing something happening
Turning to see something coming

APARTMENT FIRE ESCAPE
The Cops gear up their weapons radios CRACKLE Something

a vehicle is moving through the crowd Cops shoving people
aside to let it through The Old Lady pays no attention

She is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and
is searching for the spot for it

LOW ANGLE IN CLEAR PLACE IN FRONT OF BANK
as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front
It is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors

It stops Everyones attention is on it A black DRIVER

Sheldon stands there The police radio network CRACKLES
Theyre coming out Perpetrators and hostages together
Only authorized personnel may previously authorized and

A middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant
in flak vest and helmet that seems too small aiming through
a telescopic sight at

DOOR OF BANK

SONNY
(letting Murphy out
first yells outside)
Get away from the car

Something that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges It
is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls
and Mulvaney so they are completely protected on all sides
by hostages Over their heads is thrown some drapes from

the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear
head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl In fact they
cant be seen at all This weird apparition appears
hesitates The crowd YELLS SHOOT CHOREOGRAPH THE ACTION
so the group hesitates takes a step forward then its clear
Sonny cant see well enough to go direct to the car and the
girls are uncertain which direction to go in not having

been briefed So they stumble about make false starts and
finally arrive at the car where one girl gets into the second
row of seats behind the Driver Then Sonny slides across

next to Driver

VARIOUS ANGLES TO COVER

The police have no chance to shoot The group looks like a
bewildered centipede finding its way Mulvaney detaches
himself from the group and slips into the front seat on
Sonnys right

ON EDNA

standing alone outside filled-up limo Sheldon walks over
to Mulvaneys window

Another SHOT hits him flinging his head back

Driver holds his third shot turns to Sonny - holds gun to

nearby and turn to look at him

SONNY
Goodbye You were terrific Mouth
Youre beautiful See you

THEIR REACTIONS

They stare at him theyve already begun to forget him the
moment in the bank when they said their goodbyes is already
receding from their consciousness Their smiles are forced

and they dont really know what to say

SYLVIA
Ah Sonny Good luck you know

MULVANEY
You were terrific too

SYLVIA
Hey Its raining

And as the first welcome drops of cooling rain fall they
begin to move fast

ON SONNY
looking after them The rain hitting his face the
adventure is over But the everlasting smile overtakes him

LEON
Im glad Life is easier with him
in prison
HEIDI
It would be like always the bell
would ring wed have a ball
