ANGLE ON HOTEL ENTRANCE

The revolving doors start to swing as TWO CHILDREN (NICK
8 ASTRID 8) and TWO CHINESE WOMEN ELEANOR and FELICITY
YOUNG (30s) enter They’re DRIPPING WET dragging their
soaked luggage behind them

Nick SLIDES his feet around the polished floor leaving a
MUDDY CIRCLE in his wake The clerks look horrified
Eleanor makes her way to the front desk while
complaining to Felicity about having to walk in the bad
weather

ELEANOR
(in Cantonese
subtitled)
If you didn’t make us walk we
wouldn’t be soaked

Felicity grabs the children by the hand and follows
Eleanor to the front desk

CLERK 1

May I help you This is the
Calthorpe a private hotel --

( )

Eleanor goes to the desk and replies in PERFECT ENGLISH --
her pronunciation is BRITISH with a lilt unique to upper-
crust Chinese from former British colonies

(NOTE The specific accents of our players are important
character details indications of their background
education and socioeconomic status)

ELEANOR
I’m Mrs Eleanor Young I have a
reservation The Lancaster suite
(sees his name tag)
We spoke on the phone when I
confirmed yesterday

CLERK 1
Sorry don’t seem to have your
reservation

Clerk 2 surreptitiously presses a BUTTON under the
counter Eleanor and Felicity exchange glances
Felicity rolls her eyes sensing what’s going on

REGINALD ORMSBY (50s pompous) pops out of a door behind
the front desk and the clerks move aside

ORMSBY
Good evening I’m Reginald
Ormsby hotel manager Is there a
problem

ELEANOR
I’m Mrs Eleanor Young My family
and I would like to be shown to
our suite We’ve had a long
flight

Ormsby takes in Eleanor et al makes a snap judgment

ORMSBY
We’re fully booked madam You
must have made a mistake I’m
sure you and your lovely family
can find other accommodations
May I suggest you explore
Chinatown

FELICITY
(in Cantonese
subtitled mutters)
You can explore Hell You dog
turd

ELEANOR
Please may I use your phone to
call my husband It’s the least
you can do

Eleanor levels a glare at Ormsby who looks at her with a
tight smile

EXT CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT

RAIN POURS on the children and Felicity as they watch
Eleanor in a PHONE BOOTH “THE CALTHORPE” sign casts a
glow over them We don’t know what she’s saying but we
hear Eleanor angrily speaking on the pone

INT CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT

Eleanor bursts through the front door with her family
right behind her Eleanor approaches the front desk
again Ormsby is not pleased

ORMSBY
Mrs Young I must ask you to
leave or I’ll have to call the
police

ELEANOR
Please go right ahead

Ormsby is taken aback He moves to stop her when the
elevator DINGS and OPENS and an ELDERLY MAN IN A SILK
ROBE AND SLIPPERS comes out -- LORD CALTHORPE the same
man in the opening portrait and owner of the hotel
Ormsby snaps to

ORMSBY
Lord Calthorpe My apologies for
this disturbance --

Lord Calthorpe ignores Ormsby and beelines for Eleanor

LORD CALTHORPE
Eleanor I just got off the phone
with your husband

Lord Calthorpe kisses Eleanor on the cheek and snaps at
the clerks

LORD CALTHORPE
Get the Lancaster suite ready

Ormsby reacts confused

ORMSBY
Surely you’re joking sir

LORD CALTHORPE
I assure you I’m not As of this
evening my family’s long history
as custodians of the Calthorpe is
ended I am selling the hotel to
my dear friends the Young family

Ormsby looks at Eleanor shocked

INT DARK ROOM - PRESENT DAY Staring across a table is RACHEL CHU (29 Chinese-
American beautiful sharp) She exudes confidence
PULL BACK to reveal a pile of chips in front of her
We see someone else’s hand checking the cards theyve

been dealt 2 KINGS 2 NINES and a JACK They’re in
the middle of a five card draw poker game

As the CAMERA TILTS UP we see CURTIS (late 20s TA
white) is the player sitting across from Rachel He
stares at her over his black-rimmed glasses trying to
read her She stares back revealing nothing

Rachel pushes the pile of chips to the center of the
poker table

RACHEL
I’m all in

Curtis has FIVE CHIPS left He checks his cards again
then FOLDS

CURTIS
Fold

Rachel flips over her cards She’s got nothing

CURTIS
Nothing
(as Rachel laughs)
This whole time you had nothing

The lights come up and we see A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE CLAP
AND TITTER REVEAL we’re in AN AUDITORIUM CLASSROOM
with UNDERGRAD STUDENTS The poker table onstage is
being shown on two LARGE FLATSCREENS so the students can
follow the action

Rachel takes the lectern “Game Theory 290” appears on
the side screens

RACHEL
All right so how did I beat TA
Curtis so very very badly Well
I know for a fact that Curtis is
cheap

The students all smile and laugh totally engaged

RACHEL

So he’s not playing using logic
or math but using his psychology
Our brains so hate the idea of
losing something that’s valuable
to us that we abandon all
rational thought and make some
really poor decisions So Curtis
wasn’t playing to win He was
playing not to lose

(to Curtis tosses

him a chip)
Here Put it towards a haircut

The class LAUGHS Curtis takes the 10 with a BANDAGED
HAND

RACHEL

All right that’s it for today
Don’t forget your essays on
conditional probability are due
next week --

lasciviously

INT PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - MORNING
ELEANOR reads a Bible verse aloud to a group of ladies

ELEANOR
‘If then you have been raised with
Christ seek the things that are
above where Christ is seated at
the right hand of God’

It’s been twenty years since we’ve seen Eleanor but she
looks amazing She sits with FOUR FABULOUSLY DRESSED
BEJEWELED WOMEN JACQUELINE LING (50s) ALIX YOUNG
(50s) NADINE (30s) AND LORENA (40s) Uniformed MAIDS
serve tea and “kuih” local cakes

ELEANOR
‘Set your minds on things that are
above not on things that are on
Earth’

Eleanor’s interrupted by BUZZING She looks disapproving
as Alix and Jacqueline check their messages

These matriarchs speak with UPPER-CRUST CHINESE
SINGAPOREAN ACCENTS (perfect grammar with local
flourishes) Jacqueline reacts surprised

JACQUELINE
Eleanor is Nicki bringing a girl
to Colin’s wedding My Amanda
heard it from her friend
Francesca

Eleanor is surprised but tries not to let on

ALIX
(looking at phone)
Eddie says her name is Rachel Chu

NADINE
Oh I thought that Nick was
coming alone Did you know he had
a girlfriend

All eyes are on Eleanor who covers not wanting to get
into the details

ELEANOR
Nick dates many girls It’s hard
to keep track

JACQUELINE
Amanda knows everyone and she has
never heard of her

NADINE
Rachel Chu Or maybe she’s from
the Taiwan plastics Chu family

ALIX
(low conspiratorial)
If you want I have a private
investigator Very discreet --

ELEANOR
(interrupting)
I think we should return to the
word of God Alix

The women reluctantly return to their Bibles

ALIX

Ephesians Chapter six verse
four ‘Bring up your children in
the discipline and instruction of
the Lord’

(can’t help herself)
Oh I do hope she’s a good
Christian girl

JACQUELINE
Well if he’s bringing her home
it must be serious

NADINE
Exactly

The women all look at Eleanor

INT PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - DAY

Eleanor is on her phone standing away from her Bible
group Keeps her voice low casual

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY with Nick and Eleanor talking on
the phone

ELEANOR

seeing to Colin’s wedding

Hmm We were literally just
talking about that How could you
know

ELEANOR

Nick sees Celine (the only other Asian in the restaurant)
leaving through a revolving door

NICK

Eleanor notices the other women trying to eavesdrop

ELEANOR
(to ladies)

Move on to Corinthians I’1ll catch

up
ALIX

Ah yes
ELEANOR

(back to phone low)
We’re looking forward to having
you home And your room is all
ready for you

Nick hears this gets the implication

NICK
Thanks Mom But Rachel and I
will be staying together

Eleanor is disappointed makes another attempt

ELEANOR
I see Well I’m having the house
redone And it’s not ready for
guests If Rachel comes I think
she might be more comfortable
staying somewhere else

Nick returns to the counter to see the second sticky
toffee pudding is gone except for a TINY PIECE

NICK
All right Sorry about that

RACHEL
I saved you a piece

NICK
You did did you A very small
piece at that Thank you very
much

Hey Mom this one’s kind of cute

INT CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY

Rachel looks at her reflection in a mirror as she holds a
blue and white dress to her body Her mother KERRY
(50s real estate agent Chico chic) shakes her head
Kerry has a slight Chinese immigrant accent

RACHEL
What do you think

KERRY
No No No No You can’t wear
that to meet Nick’s Ah Ma Blue
and white is for Chinese funerals
Now this this symbolizes good
fortune and fertility

Kerry holds up a conservative RED dress

RACHEL
Great I was really going for
that ‘lucky baby-maker’ vibe

KERRY

Hey You are the one who asked
for my help picking out a dress to
meet Nick’s family

RACHEL

It’s only ‘cause I hardly know
anything about them Every time I
bring them up Nick changes the
subject

KERRY
Maybe he’s embarrassed Maybe his
parents are poor and he has to
send them money That’s what all
good Chinese children do

Rachel chuckles and they keep searching for the right
dress

KERRY
Oh you are going to have a
wonderful time You’ve always
wanted to go to Asia and who
knows if all goes well in
Singapore you might just come
back with a souvenir

RACHEL
Mom stop Nick and I haven’t
even talked about that

(MORE)

RACHEL (CONTD)
I mean his parents can’t not like
me right

Kerry has a sour look on her face and turns away to begin
rummaging through a clothes rack

EXT JFK -

RACHEL
What was that look I saw that

KERRY
Nothing It’s just Nick bringing
a girl all the way there to meet
them can mean a lot to these
overseas families Eh they’re
different from us

RACHEL
How are they different They’re
Chinese I’m Chinese I’m so
Chinese I’m an economics
professor with lactose
intolerance

KERRY

Yeah but you grew up here

(in Mandarin

Ni kan qilai shi huaren ni jiang
de shi zhongwen Keshi zheli he

impression

Flushing’s top real estate broker

Nick glances at his mother gauging her reaction

ELEANOR
Self-made woman She must be so
proud of you

Eleanor continues fiddling and fussing with the table
inspecting the food coldly turning her back on the
couple

RACHEL
Well she knows that I’m
passionate about what I do and
she’s always wanted that for me

ELEANOR
Pursuing one’s passions How
American Well your mother is
very open-minded not like here
where parents are obsessed with
shaping the life of their
children

It sounds like a compliment but Rachel isn’t entirely
sure Eleanor turns away again to talk to a passing COOK
before returning to Rachel

Eleanor shoots Nick a look He shifts uncomfortable
and is relieved to hear a MUSICAL GONG from upstairs

NICK
Hmm Oh That’s dinner

Ah Ma insists all your clothes be
washed and pressed every two
weeks

Nick sees his mother standing in the doorway She walks
over takes the shirt from his hands and selects another

shirt for him (Throughout the scene she also quietly
caters to Nick -- dusting his jacket etc)
ELEANOR
This one

As Nick takes off his soiled shirt he looks around at his
childhood room filled with pictures and mementoes

NICK
Everything is exactly as I left
it

Nick moves to a nearby desk and rifles through a drawer

ELEANOR
(glances over at him)
Looking for your cigars I had
them thrown out years ago

NICK
Never could get anything past you
could I

Eleanor smiles while she fiddles with Nick’s clean shirt
laying on the bed

ELEANOR

I keep telling Ah Ma to put your
things away but she says this
room makes her feel like you’re
still here

(then)
Well I got an earful when you
didn’t move back last year

Nick reacts it’s a loaded subject Eleanor helps Nick
put on the clean shirt

ELEANOR
Your father and I are really
looking forward to having you
home He’s not getting any
younger With you onboard maybe
he’ll take a day off once ina
while

NICK
I know Mum I’m just not ready
yet There’s things in New York
that I wanna see through

It’s not the answer Eleanor was looking for She presses
on another front

ELEANOR
Well I’m happy I finally met
Rachel She is very impressive

NICK
I think so too And I thought
you might be excited that the
first girl that I bring home is a
Chinese professor

ELEANOR

You know bringing her home
introducing her at a large family
gathering Some people may say --

INT TYERSALL PARK - DINING ROOM - DAY

QUICK CUTS of food being expertly prepared by half a
dozen MAIDS

-- Small balls of dough are rolled into flat circles

-- Minced meat is quickly rolled into dozens of perfectly-
formed uniform BALLS

A maid takes a tray of the mincemeat balls to the center
of the room where Eleanor and other family members --
Nick Rachel Astrid Cassian Oliver Alix and Felicity
-- are clustered around a large table They’re busy
folding the dumplings which are placed in neatly-stacked
bamboo steamers It’s a family tradition and they work
expertly while having multiple conversations

NICK
I can’t believe this is your first
time making dumplings

Rachel laughs

ALIX
Gotta make sure this time we don’t
run out of baskets

ASTRID
Cassian that’s not how you do it
(beat)
Very good Very good Cassian

Cassian laughs

ASTRID
And now you roll it up

As Eleanor inspects the tray and nods her approval
Felicity eyes DOZENS of waiting trays with alarm

ALIX
This is too much We’re hosting a
rehearsal dinner not feeding an
army --

ELEANOR
Better too many than have people
say were stingy

Meanwhile Nick teaches Rachel how to fold a dumpling --
putting the mincemeat ball in the dough wrapper and
sealing it closed

NICK
So right You put the baby in
bed and tuck tuck tuck Same on
the other side And you give him
a kiss goodnight --

RACHEL

Okay That’s so cute And then
you eat the baby

NICK
Hows that
(chuckles )
Then you eat the baby Not until
hes cooked

RACHEL
No you gotta make sure he’s
cooked Did Ah Ma teach you that

NICK
She did

OLIVER
I on the other hand was taught
by Grand Aunty Mabel ‘You put

the Botox in the face and then you
pinch pinch pinch then voila’

RACHEL
Did you guys all learn when you
were kids

ASTRID
We didn’t have a choice

Nods to Cassian as he happily pounds balls of dough with
his fist and rips apart dumplings

FELICITY
We taught you so you’d know the
blood sweat and tears it took to
raise and feed you monkeys

ALIX

Not like ang-mohs microwaving
macaroni and cheese for their own
children

(shudders )
No wonder they put their parents
in the old folks’ home when they
all grow up

FELICITY
I know

ELEANOR
Ah Ma says if we don’t pass
traditions down like this they’1ll
disappear

ASTRID
(to Rachel)
God forbid we lose the ancient
Chinese tradition of guilting your
children

The others all laugh --

NICK
It’s totally worth it Mother
used to wait for me after school
with a nice basket of these

ALIX
(in Cantonese
subtitled)
Ni hao ming Lucky you

Eleanor smiles at the memory

ASTRID
(to Felicity)
Hey I never got after-school
dumplings

OLIVER
Well that’s because Aunty
Felicity was doing after-school
microdermabrasion

FELICITY

(mock-scolds in

Cantonese

subtitled)
Ni le wu qie ruguo a ye zhong xi
du shi ging ni shi teng tiao wen
Zhurou Smart ass If your
grandfather was alive he’d kick
you into next week

Everyone LAUGHS Alix sees Rachel smiling Felicity
throws dough at Oliver

OLIVER
(brushing shirt)
Aunty this is Dolce

ALIX
(to Rachel)
You speak Cantonese

RACHEL

No I don’t It’s just great
seeing you guys all like this

The family exchanges looks What does Rachel mean

RACHEL
When I was growing up it was just
me and my mom Which I loved uh
but we didn’t really have a big
family like this It’s really
nice

OLIVER
Thats so lovely of you to say
Rachel We all are very lucky to
have each other

Alix and Felicity smile approving Feeling more
comfortable Rachel tries to engage Eleanor who’s been
largely silent She sees Eleanor’s RING a beautiful
piece studded with diamonds and emeralds

RACHEL
That’s a beautiful ring Aunty
Eleanor I’ve never seen anything
like it

The other women look at Eleanor trying to gauge her
reaction to Rachel

ELEANOR
(surprised then)
Nick’s father had it made when he
proposed to me

RACHEL
That’s very romantic How did you
guys meet

NICK
Actually they met at Cambridge
They were both studying law

together

RACHEL
Oh I didn’t know you were a
lawyer

ELEANOR

I wasn’t I withdrew from
university when we got married

RACHEL
Oh

Eleanor reads into Rachel’s reaction

ELEANOR
I chose to help my husband run a
business and to raise a family
For me it was a privilege But
for you you may think its old-
fashioned Its nice you
appreciate this house and us being
here together wrapping dumplings
But all this doesnt just happen
Its because we know to put family
first instead of chasing ones
passion

An awkward SILENCE falls over the table Rachel feels
chided isn’t sure how to react when

AH MA (0S)

(in Mandarin

subtitled)
O nimen dajia douzai zhe’er a
Ah everyone’s here

Ah Ma enters with her Thai maids Oblivious to the
tension she smiles to see Nick and Rachel

NICK
Ah Ma
ASTRID
Ah Ma
ALIX
Ah Ma
NICK
(to maids)
Thank you
(takes his grandma’s
arm)
Ah Ma
AH MA
Oh Nick
NICK
Come and sit
AH MA
(in Mandarin
subtitled)

O Nicki O ni ba Rachel ye

Ah Ma looks at Rachel’s face scrutinizing it

AH MA

you more clearly in the day The
shape of your nose is auspicious
Let me have a look come closer
(leans in)

En en zhang de zhen haokan
Qingchu le Very nice looking

Rachel is unsure what to make of it but it feels like
approval

AH MA
(in Mandarin
subtitled)
Sit sit grandson

OLIVER
Right right Were almost done
here Just a few more baskets

Ah Ma looks at the dumplings

AH MA

(to Eleanor in

Mandarin subtitled)
Aiyo zheshi ni bao de jiaozi ma
Zenme bao name nankan a Tuibule
You made those dumplings They
don’t look very good You lost
your touch

Astrid watches this exchange then looks at Rachel

ELEANOR
Hmm

INT TYERSALL - HALLWAY - DAY

Rachel exits the dining room looking for anywhere to go
She walks up the long staircase takes a few steps one
way realizes she’s going the wrong direction then turns
around to find Eleanor standing in front of her

RACHEL
(surprised)
Oh Hi I think I’m a little
lost This house is pretty big

Eleanor comes to Rachel and they walk and talk through
the halls of Tyersall

ELEANOR
I’m glad I found you I’m afraid
that I’ve been unfair

RACHEL
Oh no you know what Im sorry
I made an assumption I didnt
mean to offend you

ELEANOR

Not at all

(then)
You asked about my ring The
truth is Nick’s father had it made
when he wanted to propose to me
because Ah Ma wouldn’t give him
the family ring I wasn’t her
first choice Honestly I wasn’t
her second

RACHEL
Gosh Im so sorry I had no
idea

ELEANOR

I didn’t come from the right
family have the right
connections And Ah Ma thought I
would not make an adequate wife to
her son

Rachel is surprised how Eleanor is seemingly opening up

RACHEL
But she came around obviously

Eleanor gives a tight smile

ELEANOR

It took many years and she had
good reason to be concerned

(off Rachel)
Because I had no idea the work and
the sacrifice it would take
There were many days when I
wondered if I would ever measure

up --
Eleanor pauses looks at Rachel

ELEANOR
But having been through it all I
know this much
(gets close gently)
You will never be enough

Rachel is eviscerated Eleanor draws back placid calm
Then as if they’ve been talking about the weather
Eleanor walks off

ELEANOR
We should head back I wouldn’t
want Nick to worry

INT CAR - DAY

Nick drives as Rachel sits in the passenger seat silent

NICK
You all right

RACHEL
Yeah

NICK

I know my mum can be tough at
times but there isn’t anything
she wouldn’t do for me

(off Rachel’s

silence)
And there is a reason why I lived
with Ah Ma growing up It’s
because my mother knew she wasn’t
the favorite So she let her
raise me so I would be

RACHEL
You were just a kid
NICK
Yeah But Its hard to

understand from the outside But
she did what she thought was best
for the family For everyone
involved

Rachel hears the tiny reminder of her otherness

RACHEL
Mm-—hmm

Rachel takes it in hears Nick’s regard for his mother
Which makes her feel even more unsettled

NICK
Anyway I think Ive had enough
with dumplings for the rest of my
life What should we do Sushi
movies anything you like

Oh Jesus Astrid

MICHAEL
You find out I’m having an affair
with another woman and you’re
worried about making a scene

ASTRID
Youd rather I scream and carry
on

Yes Honestly I wish you would
It would show you cared about more
than what people thought of you
and your family --

ASTRID
Don’t try and turn this on me
I’m not the one who screwed up

MICHAEL

Of course not You’re always the
prettiest richest most perfect

EXT STREET - DAY

Eleanor wearing sunglasses walks by the row of old
terraced shophouses pausing when she hears a familiar
CLACKING sound She walks through an unmarked door
into

INT MAHJONG HALL - DAY

Eleanor enters to see Rachel playing mahjong with two
WOMEN at a back table

It’s a FLUID RHYTHMIC RITUAL -- the staccato clacking of
tiles stacks being formed and moved like clockwork
Eleanor is surprised to see how adept and effortless
Rachel is Eleanor walks up to the table

RACHEL
Thanks for meeting me here
(re women)
Don’t worry about them They’re
half deaf and they only speak

Hokkien
WOMAN
(hands Eleanor dice)
Mm-hmm

Eleanor sits down at the table and tosses the dice in
the middle of the stacks of tiles She starts playing
the game

RACHEL
My mom taught me how to play She
told me mahjong would teach me
important life skills
Negotiation strategy
cooperation

(NOTE The game goes on throughout the scene With
cards thrown picked up chips exchanging hands etc)

ELEANOR
You asked me here I assume it’s
not for a mahjong lesson Pung

She puts down a power card combo The women toss red
chips to her

ELEANOR
My mother taught me too

Rachel tosses her a red chip

RACHEL
I know Nick told you the truth
about my mom But you didn’t like
me the second I got here Why is
that

ELEANOR
There’s a Hokkien phrase Ka gi
lan It means ‘our own kind of
people’ And you’re not our own
kind

RACHEL
‘Cause I’m not rich ‘Cause I
didn’t go to a British boarding
school or I wasnt born into a
wealthy family

ELEANOR
Youre a foreigner American
And all Americans think about is
their own happiness

RACHEL
Don’t you want Nick to be happy

ELEANOR
It’s an illusion We understand
how to build things that last
Something you know nothing about

RACHEL
You don’t know me

ELEANOR
I know you’re not what Nick needs

RACHEL
Well he proposed to me yesterday
(off Eleanor)
He said he’d walk away from his
family and from you for good

Eleanor’s hand slips she drops a tile The other women
exchange looks sensing the tension

RACHEL
Don’t worry I turned him down

Eleanor tries to regain her composure

ELEANOR
Only a fool folds a winning hand

RACHEL
There’s no winning You made sure
of that Because if Nick chose
me he would lose his family And
if he chose his family he might
spend the rest of his life
resenting you

Eleanor grabs a tile that Rachel had just discarded

ELEANOR
(realizing)
So you chose for him

RACHEL
I’m not leaving ‘cause I’m scared
or because I think I’m not enough
Because maybe for the first
time in my life I know I am

(MORE)

RACHEL (CONTD)

(beat)
I just love Nick so much I dont
want him to lose his mom again
So I just wanted you to know that
one day when he marries another
lucky girl who is enough for you
and youre playing with your
grandkids while the tan huas are
blooming and the birds are
chirping that it was because of
me a poor raised by a single
