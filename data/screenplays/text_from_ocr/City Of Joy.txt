TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT BIHAR - DAY (DAWN SUMMER MID-1980)

Heat that has mass That rises off the parched earth in
shimmering waves After a moment we see what appear to
be figures coming out of the haze one by one A family
with their few belongings HASARI PAL 33 his wife
ALOKA 28 and their children daughter AMRITA 13
sons MANOOJ and SHAMBU 11 and 9 HASARIS MOTHER and
FATHER They embark toward the night the rising sun
behind them

EXT ROADSIDE - BUS STOP - DAY (DAWN)
Hasaris Father passes a gourd of precious water Hasari
serves the children first Shambu gulps entirely too
much the others forcing him to stop by a unified force
of will Embarrassed he passes the cup to his brother
who sips as does his sister Aloka barely wets her
lips insisting on leaving the last drops for Hasari
And now a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the
approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their
sons family There is an intense sadness at leaving
the land and Hasaris Mother clings to him
HASARI

Ill send money soon
His Mother nods as Hasari erupts in a small cough which
by habit he suppresses His Mother crushes Aloka to
her

HASARIS MOTHER

Dont let the children out of your

sight Not for a moment
Now the children She wants to keep them here even as
the old man touches her reminding her she must let them
go
HASARIS MOTHER
Help your parents Dont fight
with each other And Manooj
stay away from the cinema do you
hear
Shambu his eyes big as saucers whispers to his
grandma
( )

SHAMBU
I dont want to go There are bad
men with long knives who steal
children
That does it Hasaris Mother dissolves in tears but
the old man nevertheless unlooses her insistently from
the children Aloka and the children get on the bus as
the old man embraces his’ son
HASARIS FATHER
A mans journey to the end of his
obligations is a very long road
Yours begins here

EXT ROADSIDEINT BUS - DAY
Theres not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or
on top The passengers are silent A woman breast feeds
a baby Several passengers fan themselves Many sleep
The Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat
MANOOJ
(to his neighbor)

Our farm has died so we are

moving to Calcutta to become rich
Hasari and Aloka look at each other If only it were the
pursuit of wealth and not survival The woman under-
stands And now the BUS GRINDS forward and the Pals look
back Hasari coughs suppresses it as silence falls
The elder Pals stand huddled together in the dust and we
see nestled behind a boulder at the roadside a tiny
blue flower -- beautiful and fragile but like all things
alive determined to live and we hear the sound of a
DOZEN VOICES CHANTING a quiet mantra in unison as we --

DISSOLVE TO

INT ASHRAM - ANOTHER FLOWER - DAY

This flower floats gently in a bowl of water The TITLES
END as we PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal a dozen Anglos
several Indians and one Kenyan seated cross-legged
before an aging Yogi whos quietly urging the suppli-
cants to find their light allow your white light to
fill your spirits eye Above ceiling fans move the
air

( )

As we PAN the group we see that everyone has hisher
eyes closed in earnest meditation until we COME TO an
American MAX LOEB 29 who pops open first his right eye
-- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye
and opens his left eye -- looks left and right and

then instead of continuing the mantra and the search for
his white light expels a stream of air through his
pursed lips making a vibrating flatulent sound one
indicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal
MAX

Get serious
Around him other single eyes pop open searching for the
source of this unmeditative sound Max nods and smiles
awry smile as if to say This just aint doin it for
me folks

INT SPARTAN ROOM - TRUMPET - DAY
Max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his
clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise We
notice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his
neck His girl friend BETSY KAHN overdressed somewhat
in an Indian style endeavors to exercise the inner peace
shes been pursuing
BETSY

I swear to God you never give

anything enough time What did

you expect in five days Max

MAX
Only what they promise in the
brochure Inner peace serenity
and a nice chant that gets rid of
this rock in my gut EST they
do you in a weekend
BETSY

I would really appreciate it if

you wouldnt be terribly glib just

now Max
Thats okay with Max whos willing to eschew communica-
tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in
the valise

BETSY

Am I to assume youll be at the

airport in Calcutta a week from

tomorrow

MAX
Impossible to predict Betsy Ilene
Kahn Maybe you better give me my
ticket
BETSY
Screw you Max -- I paid for it
How many times am I going to let
you walk out on me and come back
MAX
I think only you can answer that
Betsy Ilene Kahn
She slaps him

MAX
Do you really think thats an
appropriate way to get rid of your
Western rage Bets

She swings at him again He catches her hand hard in his
fist
MAX
One slap is romantic Two would
call for retaliation Lend me a

hundred dollars
She yanks free begins to chant her mantra as he grabs
his knapsack and valise and goes out the door Now
shes silent and in the simplest sense deeply hurt
She cant help herself she cares We STAY WITH her
a moment as we -——
DISSOLVE TO

EXT COUNTRY AIRPORT (ASSAM) - WINDING ROAD - DAY

Cool lush hills A little pack of single-engine two-
and four-seaters Max in shorts and University of

Miami T-shirt hot sweaty appears around a bend in the
approach road

INT AIRPORT - WAITING ROOM

A small service desk A CLERK who doubles as Ground
Control on the microphone passing on the prevailing wind
and the active runway We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICE

of a PILOT giving his call numbers then announcing

hes clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway
The Clerk CLICKS off and finds Max

MAX

How you doin
The Clerk gives Max a warm smile

CLERK
Hello

MAX
Ive always wanted to walk into a
little airport just about like
this one and ask the guy at the
counter the following question
Ready

The Clerk nods hes at Maxs ervice
MAX
Whens the next flight to anywhere
CLERK
To Bombay Tomorrow at one
oclock in the afternoon
A beat --- the Clerk with his smile Max with his one
simply warm the other giving off simmering heat

EXT AIRPORT - LOW ANGLE - DAY

Max sits on the ground up against the building playing
a jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet A
pair of well-shod feet ENTER the FRAME Max looks up

ANOTHER ANGLE

The rubicund face of VEEJAY CHATTERGEE 50 and more
British than Churchill Behind him his cherubic wife

RAVI and making her way toward the enclave of small
planes their daughter MANUBAI 26
VEEJAY

I say are you looking for a way

out of here We have an extra

seat Where are you wanting to

go
Maxs eyes flick from Veejay to the back view of Manubai
as she continues on and back to Veejay

MAX
Im wanting to go wherever youre
wanting to take me

INT 180 FOUR-SEATER - DAY
Max is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi

ANOTHER ANGLE
We see now that contrary to our assumption that Veejay
would be in the left seat its Manubai whos flying the
plane The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak
somewhat loudly
VEEJAY
We were among the fortunate back
in 48 We got out of East Bengal
before partition destroyed so many
We make mattresses The Rajah
Double Spring
Veejay has an old flask out
VEEJAY
We dont have a flight attendant
on this flight
(passing the flask)
Are you a musician Mr Loeb
MAX
Unattached trumpet player and
recently-certified associate guru
As he takes a hit on the flask Maxs eye focuses on the
little mirror on the dash In it he can see Manubais
eyes If we were to judge by what he sees in them she
doesnt find him the least bit amusing He smiles his
smile at her

EXT HOWRAH STATION (CALCUTTA) - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

A huge bridge dominates the skyline The train trundles
to a stop its WHISTLE clearing the way People hang on
its sides sit on the roof and now flood the platform
flowing into the station clearing a view for us of the
Pals clinging to their baggage in the middle of this

human anthill

CLOSE ON THEM (MOVING)
Hands reach out with sweets to sell with tea asking for
money

MANOOJ
Daddy Im scared

HASARI
Scared No -- why This is very

exciting As soon as we get to

our friends house everything

will be fine
But despite Hasaris charade of confidence they (and
we) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the
desperate energy of the humanity around them As they
press on a small beggar woman huddled on the platform
turns her eyes eerily on Manooj as a deformed hand
stretches INTO the FRAME Aloka senses someone A
beggar face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy This
terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their
mother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one hand
and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of
his other hand It does not seem possible that he can
protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching
them He moves them quickly to a wall
HASARI
Wait right here Dont move

WITH HASARI
He moves to a line of VENDORS shows a piece of paper to
one as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a
purchase of sweets from the Vendor
HASARI

Please can you direct me to my

friend at this address We are

to stay with him
The Vendor gives the address a look shows it to the
Vendor next to him Both look at Hasari

VENDOR 1
Theres no such address as this in
Calcutta

HASARI
But thats not possible

VENDOR 1

Of course it is possible I have
lived here all my life You are
new Who would know if a place
exists or does not

VENDOR 2
Bombay perhaps Delhi Look
there

( )

Dear God what now Stunned Hasari hands Vendor 1 a
rupee and with the sweets turns back to his family his
face going through a magical transformation as he
prepares to suggest to the family that all is well

EXT CHOWRINGHEE LANE - DAY (MIDDAY SUN)
A few clean and cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into the
gateway of the Grand Hotel past a gateman

RACK FOCUS TO

FEET - MAIDAN
Feet tramping the pulsating tarmac sending up dust

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Pals scared dispirited weary consumed by the
crowd Theyve been walking a long time Shambu cries
Aloka tries to ease his fear They stop numbly at the
edge of the park put their bundles down against a long
wall

Across the way a thin policeman shares a cigarette with
a group of traders There is a deeply fearful look in
Hasaris eyes a look he is having difficulty controlling
now He needs to revive the familys confidence He

takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to
Manooj Manooj though is fixed on the cinema across

the street Hasari indicates a stall just across the
main road

HASARI
Manooj go and get some fruit
Come straight back
Delighted with his task Manooj sets off his eyes on the
marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of
Kumar Kapur starring in Hot Gun Hasari calls out to
him to watch where hes going the mere crossing of the
street is a potential parental nightmare A hand ruffles
Manoojs head and a TALL MAN with dark eyes and a sweet
smile comes at the boys anxious parents
GANGOOLY (TALL MAN)
Yes hello brother Bihar am I
correct
HASARI
Yes how did you know

Hasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching
his sons incredible journey across the street
GANGOOLY
Let me say only that the terrible
malevolence that has visited your
part of the country affects us all
HASARI
Three years without rain Nothing
came out of the earth but debts

GANGOOLY
Terrible And now the family on
the street It is not acceptable

(smile widens)
And if I cant help my name is not
Mr Gangooly Which blessedly
it is
And now a smile as full as the sky above

EXT SMALL BUILDING IN BACK STREET - DAY

A brick slides out of the wall

Were BEHIND the brick and see Gangoolys soft face as he
reaches in and pulls out a key

The street is small and empty Though the houses are
nothing much to the Pals they look like palaces
Manooj and Shambu run about in delight Gangooly motions
for quiet With a flourish he opens the door

INT SMALL ROOM - DAY
Gangooly enters glances around waves the Pals in
Theyre amazed Theres a cage occupied by two parrots
In one corner a small altar dedicated to the goddess
Lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and behind a
torn plastic curtain in a corner part kitchen part
wash place containing a tap with running water
GANGOOLY
Be free -- look around
On the faces of the family is one thought Is it
possible Amrita goes right to the parrots
GANGOOLY
Theyll need feeding Give them
seed But dont spoil them
( )

He bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the
washing area
GANGOOLY

And now one of the miracles of

life in the city One and two
He turns on the tap and a stream of brown WATER GURGLES
out The Pals are hypnotized the fists around their
hearts begin to ease

GANGOOLY
Holy water from the Ganges Flows
out forever Come -- touch it

Manooj and Shambu put their hands under the tap
GANGOOLY
Drink Its as pure as the dew on
Shivas lips
They drink Gangooly claps in delight and beckons
Hasari aside

FAVORING GANGOOLY AND HASARI
GANGOOLY

Now this place is yours for two
weeks My cousin Moti is away
traveling Normally the rent
takes fifty rupees for a week but
for a brother forty No dont
thank me

Hasari pulls out his little screw of money
HASARI
I have only seventy-five but as
soon as I have work
GANGOOLY
Give me the fifty pay the rest
next week Youll find work I
trust you Arent I from Bihar
too Yes
And the money is in his hand He joins his hands
together
GANGOOLY
You are pleased Then Mr Gangooly
is pleased Its how I am
( )

He turns on his heel and hes gone For a moment the
Pals are still swept from the brink of catastrophe to
salvation and now as one they release their sheer
and utter joy

INT MAIN ROOM - DAY
Its Hasari who watches now Theres LAUGHTER from Aloka

and Amrita Joyful SHOUTS from the boys Hasari is

alone in the main room on his knees in front of the

pile of their baggage and bundles He turns his atten-

tion from the laughter to a just-opened old suitcase

He takes out a small tea box Opens it delicately
( )

Its full of something brown He pushes his fingers in
and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness thats
almost religious puts a pinch to his nose and breathes
it in The LAUGHTER and SHOUTING from the bathing area
is GROWING

INT BATHING AREA

Shambu is paddling near the tap Aloka is bending over
the drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy dark hair
with a pot Manooj is nearby rubbing himself with an
old towel Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the
group with tenderness and with gratitude for their
good fortune

A MAN red with anger yanks the curtain aside stares
The family freezes Alokas hair drips unnoticed on her
sari

main part of the room A small crowd has been attracted
by the noise
HASARI
But this is true We paid hima
deposit of fifty --
BINAL
A man goes out because he has to
work and some beggar tries to
move in while his back is turned

This while Binal has begun to throw things out onto the
street though this cleansing of his home doesnt stop
him from picking up a stick The odd sympathizer meets
with
BINAL
So should I suffer if they are
so stupid to jump into the first
mouth that wants to eat them
He turns with the stick on Hasari
BINAL
Youre lucky I dont kill you

the remainder of their possessions and hurry out the
door

and leads the family toward the river We HOLD until
they grow small against the setting sun gleaming red
against the white domes of the Victoria Monument

INT CHATTERGEES LIBRARY - TORSO - NIGHT

Moving through the dark a figure touching things

After their humiliating flight they found refuge here
Tiny figures huddled together with their baggage and
bundles near a tree not far from the steps that dip
down to the smooth water Hasaris eyes too are on
the dead man that warning He kneels beside Manooj

the bg The man behind the gate shakes his head
points

ANOTHER ANGLE
A line of a hundred men stretches from a door Hasari
is on the edge of panic but when he turns to the family
hes wearing his confident smile As before he gathers
the family into the protectorate of his arms and guides
them onward As he pushes off into the sea of humanity
we PULL BACK AND UP FILLING the FRAME WITH street upon
street disappearing Hasari

FROM STREET - INTO WORKSHOP - HASARI AND OWNER

clothing
The mirror stops at Max slipping into a kurta before an
audience of Ravi Manubai and a salesman

Hasari feels hes been a little rough on the boy He
holds him close

HASARI

Aloka the boys nod We WATCH them as Hasari heads
off quickly becoming a small figure disappearing into
the sea

EXT JUTE MILL DAY - LATE AFTERNOON SUN
Starting to sink We PAN DOWN TO Hasari stepping to
a grilled window as the man ahead moves out

INT JUTE MILL - DAY
A flaking gray wall half-obscured with moldering files
The grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet
supplications of those outside
An old CLERK at a desk A voice calls out The Clerk
looks up crosses to the grill
Hasaris tense face through the bars A TRUCK RUMBLES
past drowning out the words except these trade
union The Clerk shakes his head sadly On the verge
of panic Hasari hangs onto the window

EXT GREEN ACRES COURTYARD - COW - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
Bare feet and then sneakered feet step over the sleep-
ing bovine who turns a disinterested eye up

Max is guided by a grumpy hall PORTER wearing an off-
white shirt and bellbottoms through the walled and well
planted courtyard of an inexpensive hotel Max gives the
cow a bemused eye

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY
The room is utterly utilitarian The Porter turns on a
ceiling fan sending an army of cockroaches scurrying
for calmer terrain Max clearly doesnt care for

PORTER

pleasure
Max smiles his smile and disappears the Porter behind the
closed door The smile disappears and the FAN gets his
attention it has an annoying rhythm and sound He
flicks the switch but the fan continues to snap around

He stares at it and startles us by suddenly flicking
out a hand and grabbing the blade stopping the fan
He lets go The fan is still He carries his knapsack
to the tub it has brown stains along the middle and
the water has a brown tinge as it flows out of the tap
He sits on the edge of the tub dumps his knapsack on
the floor picks up a half-dozen pamphlets from the
ashram

on his face clutching some bananas and dried grain
His relief -- and ours -- is short-lived

The space where he left the family has been cleared
and taken over by trucks Hes lost his family

panic-stricken Hasari rushes up

CUT TO

UNDER BRIDGE - DAY
His head turns and his eyes look this way that way
until out of the near silence we hear a distant
extraordinary word

( )

CHILD (0S)
Daaaaaaddddddyyyyy
The word catches Hasaris ear He looks into the sea
of people along the river bank under the bridge
CHILD (0S)
Daaaaaadddddddyyyy
As in a dream Shambu rises up out of the sea of bodies
and runs to his father
SHAMBU
Daaaaadddddyyyy

Now Aloka Amrita Manooj appear rising up out of the
sea ending Hasaris nightmare
A warrior returning from battle Hasari engulfs the
little boy
HASARI
I told you to remain where I left
you I told you to stay there
MANOOJ
The police came
SHAMBU
We said we had to meet you but
they didnt care They were
mean
As before Hasari tries to engulf the rest of his family
in the protectorate of his arms In the bg Arun and
his family

ALOKA
These friends have found space
They will share with us
Hasari looks at the tiny space The roof is cardboard
and cloth and half an old movie poster featuring the
actor Kumar Kapur Hasari looks at his tiny bit of

food debates a moment then puts his hands together
addresses these generous people
HASARI

I would be proud if you would

share our food with us
Everyone looks at the food there is no disguising their
hunger

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT
Distant transistor MUSIC as we PAN DOWN The Pal
children sleep despite the QUIET MOANS and nightmare
CRIES around them the two boys huddled together Amrita
close to her mother
Hasari comes out of the dark Aloka looks at him He
shakes his head He slumps beside her Aloka strokes
Hasari looking lovingly at him
ALOKA

I remember the first time I saw

you on the day of our marriage

Wearing a bright yellow turban

You asked me my name and you said

You are a very beautiful girl

and I am wondering whether you

will find me appealing
He strokes her tenderly in return but now overwhelmed
with despair she begins to weep
HASARI

She doesnt want to say it doesnt want to wake the
children

HASARI
Its all right -- what

I miss the village There I

could help
Hasari pulls Aloka close strokes her

Awaken -- startled disoriented Aloka gentles the
children as Hasari moves instinctively toward the threat

SCENE
A black ambassadorial car pulls up out of which steps
a BABU A microphone and speaker has been set up
Another car unloads several politicos with party banners
A minion hands the Babu the mike he wants to get on with
it before this turns into a political rally Hasari is
close to him as is Arun
BABU
The municipality has directed us
to carry out the destruction of
this settlement All of you must
go -- now
For a moment there is a babble of fear and frustration
Then from Hasaris side Arun confronts the Babu
ARUN
For what reason
The Babue appears disconcerted Hes not accustomed to
the poor asking questions
BABU
Because this settlement is
impeding construction work

ARUN
Were not moving Why should
we move Who is the municipality
We are This is our home

BABU
I have my orders

ARUN
If were driven from here where
should we go

BABU
Ill give you five minutes to
gather your things Then the
settlement comes down

( )

ARUN

Why should you alone be burdened

with such a task Let me help
Arun begins to tear his shelter apart and to heave the
pieces at the Babu who retreats Others soon take up
the call to vent their frustration hurling things at
the police and at the driver of the tractor Quickly
weve got a full-scale riot The police wade into the
crowd pounding people with their sticks Arun one of
the first to get hit He staggers into Hasaris arms

FAVORING PALSARUN AND HIS FAMILY

Unbelievable Panic-stricken Hasari and Aloka gather
the children and their few belongings as beside them

instinctively to help the woman but Hasari grabs her
trying to shelter her and the children as well as Aruns
wife and children clutching Arun to him as in the chaos
they manage to escape

mattress From his dreamland he inquires solicitously
Have you ever thought of a Rajah Double Spring as a
present We PAN DOWN and FIND the Pals and Arun and his
family panting terrified beneath the sign
SHAMBU

Daddy are we going to die here

Hasari can see on everyones face this question

HASARI
No Today Im just a mangy dog
on the street but soon I swear
Ill look other men in the eye
(a beat)
I swear
Yet on his face we see the extraordinary pressure to make
this promise reality

EXT SIDE OF RESTAURANT
Hasari reaches the head of a line and receives a small
handout Turning away he studies the morsel of food
His head aches his belly screams with hunger but he
takes only a single bite then carefully wraps the rest
in a cloth and knots it

( )

He feels a tug at his elbow Its a 15-year-old BOY with
thick scholarly spectacles
RAFIK (BOY)

Why live like a beggar when you

can live like a maharajah
Hasari stares at the boy

INT BLOOD DISPENSARY - CLOSE ON HASARIS ARM - DAY
A needle injected blood flowing into a bottle

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hasari seated on a stool watching his blood leave his
body his face broken out in perspiration

HASARI
I thought you were only taking a
little
ATTENDANT
We pay more we take more
HASARI
Im feeling a little dizzy
ATTENDANT

HIS POV

Rafik and a thin man chatting easily and exchanging ciga-
rettes with another attendant His vision BLURS

HASARI AND NURSE
With his free hand he begins to grapple for the Atten-

dant to keep his balance starts to fall and the
SCREEN GOES BLACK
FADE IN

EXT DISPENSARY - DAY

A woozy Hasari gives Rafik his share Rafik in turn gives

the thin man his share The thin man bows his farewell

RAFIK
Blood is the oil well of the poor
brother Now give me another
three and Ill give you these
He opens his hand with its dirty nails In it lie a
little group of pills like highly-colored sweets
HASARI
What are those
RAFIK
Vitamins Take these and you can
give again in a week

While Hasari considers Rafik pours the pills into
Hasaris hand takes the three rupees Hasari downs the
pills
RAFIK
One week Here The same time
And hes gone leaving Hasari woozy but at least for
the moment blessed to count his money

INT MAXS ROOM - NIGHT
Max lies on his messed bed contorted with his feet up
over his head against the wall A book lies open beside
him A half-eaten room service meal many hours old
moulders on the bedside table Max is babbling a mock
sports case into his fist
MAX
Theyre in the shotgun Theres
the snap from center the clock is

running -- five four three -- he
has an open man at the Notre Dame
twenty for the victory and he

freezes He freezes Mr Choke

chokes The fans go --
A KNOCK at the door Max shuts up falls off the wall
He crosses to the door Opens it POOMINA is 16
beautiful and exotic-looking behind her excessive makeup

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING MAX
The porter pushes the girl gently into the room smiling
at Max nodding The door is closed

MAX AND POOMINA
He may have been receptive to a sweet young girl but
not a kid in her teens
MAX
Got an ID on you
(she doesnt get it)
How old are you
POOMINA
Twenty sahib
MAX
I buy that
She approaches him seductively

POOMINA
I can do anything you want sahib
She fingers the Hebrew letter at Maxs throat on its

gold chain For a moment Max is mesmerized by this
child but then as she begins more serious ministra-
tions he pulls back

MAX

Hold it time out Time theres
time out on the field

POOMINA

Is problems sahib
MAX

Is problems yeah just a couple
POOMINA

No please yes I can --

Theres something desperate in her that makes him put a
finger to her lips and say
MAX
How bout some chow
(she doesnt get it)

I was just about to order some room

service Food I call they come

we eat
She stares at him
INT MAXS ROOM - NIGHT (HALF HOUR LATER)
Max smokes a Monte Cristo and watches Poomina like a
frightened little animal devour the last of a Green
Acres room service meal and then wrap a small piece of
fish in the paper napkin

( )

She looks up at him delivers a small burp Covers her
mouth in charming embarrassment

POOMINA
Now you are ready for great
pleasure yes
MAX
Watching you eat was my great
pleasure Now you go home
As he escorts her toward the door Poomina is distressed
Max realizes she cant leave empty-handed He pulls out
some notes
MAX
For you
She hasnt given up though and as he takes the money
she stands on tiptoe and kisses him Torn Max begins
to respond He stops himself his grip on her causing
her discomfort His breath comes in little bursts
MAX
Youre a very wet kisser Work on
it get in touch in five years
He leads her toward the door Like some lunatic comedy
she resists He pushes She locks her knees He opens
the door
MAX
Goddamn it cut it out Now good
night
He muscles her out the door closes it wipes his lips
He stares at a parade of cockroaches gliding along the
wall as he listens to her CRYING quietly on the other
side of the door He debates and he loses Opens the
door Poomina stands there the tears stop and a lip-
twitching smile lights her face
MAX
Five years already Gee time
really flies when you have no
moral conviction
She slides into his arms pressing against him With his
shoulder he closes the door leaving us outside

INT BACK ALLEY - BAR - FLAMING LIGHT - NIGHT
A bare light bulb a SCRATCHY vinyl RECORD on a turn-
table

Poomina watches Max do a sleight-of-hand trick with a
coin He tosses it up brings his hands past each other
then holds out his fists she picks on but the other
holds the penny Fooled she laughs He does it again
she points to one fist -- empty -- then other -- also
empty Max reaches behind her ear and produces the
coin She loves it her laughter escalating But then
she seesm to read something in the bg where we see four
thugs two of whom will become known to us as THE GOONDA
a capo to the local mafia chieftan and ASHOKA son of
the local Godfather Ashoka works on a pimple on his
chin The Goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with
spit from one of his expensive new running shoes Max
eyes the thugs eyeing him

MAX
Short guys Quit lookin at us
This remark goes over big with the thugs Max doesnt
care He knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle
The bartender brings them two shots of something in two
unmatched glasses
POOMINA

Special drink for you sahib

Only the most man can drink it

You make try For me

MAX
For you I would drink battery
acid

POOMINA
Who that finish first I bet

She puts her glass to her lips and in a childish
exaggerated way mimes waiting for him to commence a
drinking race with her The two of them toss off whats
in their glasses The bangla in Maxs glass is stronger
than battery acid He does an elaborate routine involv-
ing the pain the surprise the sheer awfulness of the
drink But puts it down with mock machismo

POOMINA
I beat
MAX
I really dont think so -- oh no

nay nay I never lose the truly
irrelevant contest
POOMINA
We have fun some more I bet
again

She turns to the bartender calls for two more All the
while in the bg The Goonda and his two thugs watch
emotionlessly and Ashoka works on his acne

EXT BAR - NIGHT

Max sings Take It to the Limit with enormous inebriated
sincerity as Poomina helps him out of the bar Theres a
big black motorcycle parked outside Max glances at it

as they start down the alley As he looks back to the
road ahead he finds The Goonda in front of him Max
isnt so drunk that he doesnt sense what this is about
He looks behind him Indeed the other two goons are
there Ashoka straddles the big cycle

MAX
Well well Seek punishment and ye
shall find
Knowing whats coming Max nevertheless unleashes a
beautiful howl and tries to trample The Goonda off-
tackle From behind hes hit with a length of stick
He goes down looks up through blasted eyes at Ashoka as
two sticks now land against his shoulder and his head

EXT MAHARAJAH SIGN - NIGHT
The Pals sleep beneath the sign Hasari awakens from
restive sleep to the sound of a FIGHT He gets up The
others awaken
ARUN
Dont go -- what are you doing

HASARI
It sounds like someone needs help
Hasari bolts for the corner

ALLEYWAY
As Hasari turns into the head of the alley he can see
three men beating someone a fourth man standing off to
the side watching
HASARI
What are you doing
(calling back)
A mans being beaten here
As Hasari runs down the alley the MOTORCYCLE FIRES UP
and SCREAMS OFF and the three goons take flight

HASARI AND MAX
Hasari runs up reaches out to Max whos barely on his
feet As Hasari touches Max Max turns and belts Hasari
in the nose nailing Hasari to the wall as Max collapses
at Hasaris feet Hasari grabs his nose with one hand
and kneels beside the fallen Max as a shadow moves
and startles Hasari He peers into the dark and
Poomina steps into the light

The crucifix sways Now Maxs eyes RACK FOCUS TO the
cherubic face of JOAN BETHAL peering AT the CAMERA
without sympathy

ANOTHER ANGLE

him Behind her Hasari Pal
JOAN
Good morning junior welcome to

Max manages to sit up Wishes he hadnt
MAX
Oh I like the way the room moves

(checking out his
accommodations)

I suppose I should inquire where I

JOAN

Youre in the City of Joy

MAX

Is that geographic or spiritual

JOAN

Oh now we require that each
visitor decide that for himself
This gentleman and a young lady

brought you here
MAX

Did I do that to your nose

(as Hasari nods)
Im sorry

Hasari shrugs smiles and a gigantic rat drops in
Maxs lap He leaps to his feet and against the wall

The rat

say

scurries away
MAX

What was that -- a Shetland pony

JOAN

I would have to inspect it more

closely but I believe

that was

one of our economy-size rats
Max clambers for the door

JOAN
Watch your --

Too late Joan thinks to

Max cracks his head on the door frame

MAX

He ducks outside for some air

in Western clothes raises a hand in greeting to Joan
On the door Max and Joan have come through City of Joy
Self Help School and Clinic Across the way a young man
is dandling a baby on his knee rubbing its back and
sniffing at its neck Small group of children around a
blackboard with a teacher MARGARETA doing numbers
RAM CHANDAR the rickshaw puller readies to go out to
work Trying to orient himself Max turns

ANOTHER ANGLE

children staring at him

He knows them by type patients He looks at the sign
on the door
MAX

JOAN

MAX
This is obviously one of those
three days
JOAN
Indeed What brings you to our

JOAN
Ah yes I take it you didnt

MAX
Kept opening the doors and windows
of my spirit but couldnt see a

JOAN

JOAN

Oh how exciting Must be

JOAN

JOAN

MAX

JOAN
I cant imagine ever divining how

us Indians you know who believe
the tourist trade ought to be
encouraged

Max turns to Hasari Hasari is incredibly shy can
barely meet Maxs eyes

MAX
Thank you very much Let me
He goes for his money
HASARI

No please
Max finds his pockets empty Then reaches for his wrist
-- his watch is gone -- and then his throat -- his chai
is gone too
JOAN

Ram heres your first rider

(to Max)
Take this
She holds out several rupees toward him All eyes on

JOAN

EXT STREET - FLYING FEET - DAY
Max in the rickshaw Hasari running alongside Ram an
exuberant smile slashed across his face

HASARI
You see I can keep up

RAM
Keep up of course Anyone can
run at this pace But you think
its easy to run and to pull

HASARI

I can do it I could pull it

MAX
Come on give him a shot Hes as
fast as you and looks twice as
strong

RAM
Will you still pay me when he runs
you into a ditch

MAX
Absolutely I trust the man
Suddenly Ram comes to a stop
RAM

All right you come step in here
Hasari looks on Max with enormous gratitude Ram puts
the shafts down has a short coughing fit spits some
phlegm looks at Max

MAX
I hope youre taking something for
that
Ram waves him off as Hasari lifts the shafts to his hips
RAM

Now fine pull go
Hasari tries to pull but the center of gravity isnt
easy to find This is enormously difficult and Hasaris
very clumsy at it The street is crowded The traffic
is beginning to back up behind them The driver and
conductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults
RAM
See mister What did I tell
you Come on What do you think
this is -- some village street
Youve got to move quickly
He turns to Max
RAM

You see it takes a gift

MAX
I say he can do it Ill bet you
the fare he can do it
(play by play)

What do you think rickshaw fans

can he do it
The crowd isnt in for fun Hasari strains forward
The rickshaw moves with him Ram moves alongside
shouting instructions and oaths A cop comes on the run
screaming at Hasai which makes Ram importune more
strongly and Max joke more vociferously
Even under this incredible pressue Hasari gains
confidence and begins to move quicker earning shouts
of approval from Max and Ram who now has trouble
keeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom
an avalanche of oaths following them

INT GODFATHERS HOUSE - DAY

At first all we see are feet on a marble floor The
Goondas in his running shoes then Ram and Hasaris
bare feet

This is the partitioned splendor of an old house
sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past
Everything is baroque rotting and somehow impressive
Hasari has never been anywhere like this and is caught
between curiosity and fear of breathing

INT THRONE ROOM
The three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun-
light -- dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment
of furniture Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next
to ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean
Sitting behind a desk is Ashoka leaning over a mirror
squeezing a balky pimple
Near a large window his 60-year-old father GHATAK in
a European jacket and dhoti works with intense concen-
tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a
twist of fine wire
The three new arrivals stand silent and respectful
before the desk At last without raising his head
ASHOKA
Not a tongue between you then

RAM
Yes yes I am wondering sir
we are is it possible you might
have something for my friend
Ram indicates Hasari as if there might be some question
to whom hes referring Ashoka attacks the pimple
RAM
Let me explain it for your ears
sir My cousin from Bihar has
just arrived in our city --
GOONDA
Theyve brought a small present
-- of respect
The Goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk
Ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance at
Hasari

ASHOKA
So you want to be a human horse
RAM
Oh yes I have personally witnessed
his excellence -- yes
ASHOKA
He doesnt talk Can he neigh at
least
(to Hasari)
You -- do your ears function
HASARI
Oh yes Babu Can I uhm
ASHOKA
Neigh Like a horse

Ashoka pulls back his lips shows his teeth and imitates
a neigh Ne-igh Ne-igh
HASARI

Well yes Babu I can do that

Would you like me to imitate a

horse
Finished with the pimple Ashoka wipes a finger on his
shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes
as

ANOTHER ANGLE
Behind him The Godfather walks up to the desk putting
his glasses on He barely glances at his son but
waves him out of the chair
Ashoka doesnt like it but he steps aside As he does
he turns a look of hatred on Hasari Through no fault of
his own Hasari has made an enemy Ghatak chews on a pan
and casts a benevolent eye on Hasari

GHATAK
Lift your longhi
Hasari does The Godfather looks at his legs and thighs
GHATAK

The wise men of our nation say that
nirvana is the attainment of a
state of supreme detachment For
me nirvana is counting each
evening one by one the rupees
earned by my two thousand and
forty-six rickshaws
Hasari doesnt know whether to respond A glance at
Ram tells him not to Ghatak gestures for Hasari to
lower his longhi

GHATAK
You are with family

HASARI
I have a wife and three children
Babu

GHATAK

And they must eat heh The
world is full of open mouths
He chews on this a moment then opens a drawer and
holds a small tinkling rickshaw bell toward Hasari
Hasari understands that incredibly he has a job His
breath is so shallow he can barely utter his gratitude
He takes the bell
HASARI
I shall be eternally grateful to
you From now on I shall be as
the youngest of your brothers
GHATAK
Stay loyal These days its a
crop nobody plants
The Godfather turns his beatific and Godlike smile on
Hasari Pal

EXT MATTRESS SIGN - DAY (EARLY EVENING)
Transitor MUSIC The Pals load the rickshaw that stands
at the road with Ram in it There are embraces with the
bruised Arun and his family

EXT SQUARE AND STREET (CITY OF JOY) - DAY
About twenty tattered street kids faces shining with en-
joyment They run and shout as they pursue something
just out of frame

WIDE SHOT

The cause of the excitement is Hasari running TOWARD us

feet flying as he pulls the rickshaw loaded with a huge
sack Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of the

machine

Ram stands in the center of the square He shouts a
command and Hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a
stop Its not easy and Sunil -- whos arriving -- has to

jump out of the way to the accompaniment of apologies from
Hasari and Ram and hoots of laughter from the children
Outside the clinic a line of perhaps seventy-five wait
patiently watching as Hasari takes off again The wheels

of the rickshaw hit a rut Hasari loses control the sack
tips back and Hasari is lifted into the air feet kicking

as he tries to regain his balance Aloka and Amrita

sitting near the bawling Ram cant hold back their
laughter

EXT SQUARE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY

The square is set with obstacles As Ram shouts instruc-—
tion we see Hasari negotiate them with much increased
skill He stops in front of a small group Its his
family plus Joan and Surya With an exhausted smile he
signs to Aloka and Amrita to get in They do and Hasari
takes them triumphantly around the circuit

HIGH ANGLE
Hasaris triumphant ride continues and we

RAM
Let Hasari go
The line of rickshaw pullers turns to Hasari The other
pullers wish him well as he comes forward His heart
pounds ever so politely he helps the School Girl into
his carriage She gives him the address of the St Pius
School
HASARI
Im sorry I dont know where that
is Youre my very first passenger
SCHOOL GIRL
Really Well I hope I bring you
luck
She gives him a sweet smile
SCHOOL GIRL
That way and then to the right
His moment has arrived He looks at Ram and thrusts
his hips forward setting off into the insanity of the
traffic eyes flicking left and right A HORN RAILS at
him and a taxi tries to run him down calling and laugh-
ing as Hasari jumps in terror
RAM
(calling)
Feed the police
Other pullers laugh call after Hasari and as he
approaches the first corner he manages to pull out a
rupee and deposit it into the hand of the impassive
traffic policeman and then turn right

EXT ST PIUS - DAY
The School Girl hands him a slip of paper
SCHOOL GIRL
This is my home address Pick me
up promptly at seven each morning
HASARI
Yes thank you you can depend on
me
The girl runs into the school yard met immediately by
friends Hasari looks around at the clean bustling
school at all the children in their crisp uniforms and
a look of great yearning comes over his face

INT SMALL RESTAURANT - DAY
Max is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants
MAX

Now though he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and
engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter

He reaches for the necklace with the Hebrew letter
Ashoka recognizes Max Looks around for help There is
none
ASHOKA
Dont touch me No one touches me
MAX
Really
Max grabs Ashoka who breaks free and GUNS the CYCLE
down a side street Max gives chase his aching ribs
slowing him a bit

SEVERAL CUTS
Ashoka glancing back begins to open up some distance
Yet Max hangs tough weaving like a broken field runner
through the mass of bodies and vehicles Now suddenly
he loses Ashoka He has to make a choice about this
corner or that one He chooses

EXT CITY OF JOY - AROUND CORNER - DAY (EARLY EVENING)

A COP steps into his path He sees Ashoka up ahead Hes
hopelessly out of breath
MAX
Oh great goodgood timing

give chase

sister to support Its all right

Poomina Anouar what is it
She moves to them Theyre all three badly out of breath

WITH JOAN AND LEPERS

ANOUAR
Its Meeta Its her time But
something is wrong The midwives
dont know what to do Dr Sunil
could he help perhaps

JOAN
Dr Sunil isnt here

POOMINA
Meeta will die

ANOTHER ANGLE
Joan turns to Max who hasnt heard the exchange
JOAN
Max I wouldnt ask but its an
emergency A pregnancy gone awry
Its a leper Could you have a
look
Max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers
MAX
I dont have any experience with
leprosy
JOAN
Good Christ son because shes
a leper doesnt mean shes not
built like a woman
HASARI
I can run and get Dr Sunil
JOAN
Its too far
( )

Suddenly impulsively
ALOKA
I could help Ive had three
babies
RAM
You cant do that Theyre
outcasts theyre unclean
There are murmurs of assent from the others
JOAN
Oh nonsense Its not contagious

A beat -- everyone fixed on Max
HASARI
Youre a doctor how can you not
help

EXT PATH-NIGHT

The moon reflects off the dark puddles of muddy water
that line the side of the railway tracks Anouar
propels his board with astonishing agility along the
path Said and Poomina running with him Max Joan
carrying a first aid bag Aloka and Hasari following
slipping and sliding on the rough ground with its
puddles and sewage

EXT RAILWAY LINE - LEPER HUTS - NIGHT

The little procession arrives outside the three rough
huts made of bamboo plastic sheeting cloth wood
and cardboard A few shadows materialize Lepers --
staring silently

Anouar points into a hut Joan and Aloka precede Max
inside Max forgets to bend and bumps his head

INT HUT - NIGHT
The only light is the feeble waver from a candle The
blind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground Her
ragged sari is pulled up to her middle Her face runs
with sweat her hair is plastered to her face A girl
with black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood
Meeta sends up a SOFT uninterrupted MOAN A wedge of
blood-soaked cloth is between her legs

( )

A middle-age leper is leaning over her -- a midwife
encouraging Meeta with a string of commands in their
own language
Max kneels Aloka at his side His breathing becomes
shallow but then he pulls off the blood-soaked
bandages Between Meetas legs he can just make out
the bottom of a foot The child is breached Maybe
already dead
ALOKA
Will she die
Max goes into reflex actions Joan has opened the first
aid kit Theres a flashlight among the medicine
alcohol compresses scissors etc He hands the flash-
light to Aloka as
MAX
(to Joan)
Pull me two ccs of Coramine
He nods at Aloka she illuminates the scene
MAX
Uh-oh uh-oh whos this coming
down the lane Why its -- is it
possible -- way over here in
India -- yes its Mr Choke
He comes to a stop Everyone stares at him Meeta
moans For a moment he stays frozen Aloka reaches
out instinctively wipes the sweat from his eyes This
gesture seems to free him he looks at her looks at the
room and its expectant trusting faces

MAX

Im going to have to turn it --

the baby Tell her she has to

relax these muscles as much as

she can
He doesnt finish the sentence Aloka speaks softly to
Meeta as Max takes Meetas arm makes a tourniquet
Joan hands him the syringe and he injects Hands the
syringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning the
baby
Aloka takes Meetas hand and its a moment before we
realize Aloka with her fine hand is holding Meetas
fingerless palm

OUTSIDE
A small group waits trying to determine from the sounds
whats happening inside Anouar pours tea from a pot on
the small fire offers the cup to Hasari Hasari stares
at the cup doesnt want to be impolite but more than
that doesnt want to touch the cup He shakes his head
smiles Anouar drinks off the tea

INSIDE
Sweat pours down Maxs face into his eyes He shakes it
out Aloka leans forward and with her new sari wipes
the sweat away again Max nods thanks
MAX

Tell her again to breathe in short

little bursts now
He demonstrates Aloka does the same to Meeta Meeta
tries to cooperate And suddenly Max has the baby
turned
MAX
All right Now tell her to push
Aloka translates Meeta pushes The midwife the little
girl Aloka lean forward
MAX
Again Yes Again Its coming

OUTSIDE

No one is sitting now Everyone hangs close to the
door Only Hasari remains apart seated on a tree stump
in the middle of the quad He coughs suppresses it

INSIDE
MAX
Ive got the head Come on
little baby come on little
baby Be alive be alive be
alive
Aloka wipes the sweat away again He looks at her his
voice squeezed out through his teeth
MAX
Weve got it weve got it Yeah

He seems as released as Meeta Then he gives a last
gentle tug and a CRY squeezes out of the little piece of
life in his hands Max is fairly overwhelmed by the life
in his hands Poomina steps close a smile on her lovely
face and touches the baby in Maxs hands

EXT LANE - NIGHT
Max Joan Aloka and Hasari walk in silence down Nizamudhin
Lane There is only the mingled sound of COUGHING
MOANING and a TRANSISTOR RADIO nearby playing a popular
song Outside the clinic they stop She takes his hand
JOAN
For a non-practicing doctor that
was pretty practiced

MAX
Never been so scared in my life
Its a warm open moment between them But now theres
the ongoing desperation of her needs
JOAN

Max please wont you change your
mind We desperately need another
doctor Full-time Think about
it -- just give us a couple of
months

MAX
Cant do it Maybe youve got it
in you to be a saint I just
dont

JOAN
Then what do you want What are
you going to be when you grow up
Good night Aloka Hasari
Joan goes inside leaving Max Aloka and a very uncom-
fortable Hasari alone a moment

ALOKA
Thank you for allowing me to go
with you

MAX

You could make a helluva nurse
A little smile comes over her face no ones ever paid
her that kind of compliment She goes into Rams hut
leaving Max and Hasari now
( )

HASARI
I think perhaps you are a good
man
Hasari brings his hands together and goes inside

EXTINT JOANS AND THE PALS (ALTERNATE) - NIGHT
Max hears Joan praying inside
JOAN (0S)
Jesus my brother you who I am
trying to believe are the light
and salvation of the puking world

THE PALS
Aloka sits huddled with her husband while their children
sleep they listen
JOAN (0S)
Please see that we are living in
madness and darkness here
MAX
listens
JOAN (0S)
and we need help Om Jesus
om and amen
Suddenly he hurtles into motion He runs down the alley
his stride stretching out swallowing up the distance
between here and the world beyond the City of Joy in
great gulps

EXT CALCUTTA AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

self-destructive self
She cant find anything fierce enough so she abates
tries to get it together to make a dignified exit
BETSY
But youve taught me something
Max You never finish anything
Well I quit Ive found my
light and Im free of you
She heads for the gate people parting to give her a
wide berth

MOVING SHOT - TOWARD THE GATE
MAX

account and wire --
BETSY
Do it yourself Max Call her
collect You should have called
her weeks ago anyway just because

White light white light
She hands her ticket and boarding pass over and shes
through the gate Max turns to find the audience fixed
on him

MAX
Guerilla theater folks All the

appreciation by a small donation
Many smiles and several instant offers of rupees

EXT SQUARE - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
The line is long At this moment Joan is checking a
childs throat with a tongue-depressor Aloka is walking
beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for
disposal Hasari and Ram are getting ready to leave
Anouar appears at Joans waist
ANOUAR
Good morning Joan Di Dr Loeb
said many of us could be helped
that all it would take is money
for medication
Anouar hands Joan some newspaper in which something is
wrapped Joan opens the paper Inside is a good deal of
money
ANOUAR
Please buy the medication for us
If we cannot come here to receive
it perhaps Dr Loeb would come
to us
JOAN
Ill be happy to buy the medication
but Dr Loeb is not part of this
endeavor Anouar there is only his
cherished memory

ANOUAR
Then perhaps I am having visions

Anouars focus is up the lane Joan follows his focus
to

THEIR POV

expensive-looking bridal shop

loose Hasari springs toward his passenger

INT EXAMINING ROOM - DAY
Max with his stethoscope to Meetas baby Meeta in a
brightly-colored sari and a lot of bracelets and Aloka

looks on Poomina clings to the wall

MAX
Hes just malnourished Is she
giving him the milk we gave her or
selling it
Aloka asks Meeta in Hindi Meeta clearly swears shes
giving the baby the milk Aloka pushes her

ALOKA
Not all Most
MAX
Tell her to give all the milk to

the baby

Aloka does so as Max bounces the baby coos to it play-
fully The baby pees all over him Aloka translates
quickly Meeta starts apologizing Poomina cant help
laughing Max reminds Meeta that thats once for each

of the two weeks of the babys life Aloka soothes Meeta
as she hustles her Poomina and the baby out then
quickly begins to wipe Maxs face with a clean rag This
isnt something shes accustomed to doing but shes
doing it before she has time to think Max finds himself
conscious of her closeness to him and then she becomes
suddenly self-conscious and she backs off ducks her
head He peeks up under

MAX
Psst
She looks at him
MAX
Its okay
He smiles So does she

EXT SQUARE - DAY (EARLY EVENING)

Sunil stands outside the clinic rolling his sleeves

Bay Manooj and Shambu come charging at Max with the
soccer ball hoping to engage him as a playmate Hasari
returns home with his rickshaw
Selima waves at Max indicates shes cooking dinner
Joan wanders out of the school as the kids are released
and go charging through the square Joan has the Pal
kids in hand
SELIMA

Very special supper for you

MAX
Wish I could Selima because Im
sure hungry Sixteen hours of
pestilence and misery always make
me famished I have to go with my
man Anouar tonight Ive got
lepers to heal
ANOUAR
No no you know how patient we
are Eat eat
MAX
(to Aloka)
Youre not tired are you
ALOKA
Not if youre not
Between Hasari and Aloka theres just a flicker of
tension evidently this has become Maxs (and her)
normal day But hes also worried about the note from
Ashoka Joan joins them with the Pal children
JOAN
Well I think weve got three very
good potential scholars here
Behind the childrens backs she points at Manooj and
indicates the kids really got a head
JOAN
Given him some time here hell
be good enough for a proper school

HASARI
Its more than a father could hope

MAX

Fifteen years from now Miami
Florida Dr Manooj Pal in
association with Dr Maxwell Loeb
For a moment Hasari is swept up in this little reverie
then remembers reality
HASARI
(giving her the note)
From the godfathers son For you

and the doctor
Amidst instant concern Joan opens the envelope Looks
at Max We hear the sound of BANGLADESH MUSIC

INT GODFATHERS THRONE ROOM - OLD RADIO - DAY

The MUSIC is of days gone by playing on an old RADIO
Sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke The
godfather MR GHATAK Looking infirm wipes a tear from
his eye

GHATAK
Acha
Now we see Max and Joan seated on cushions before the
godfather tea in hand Max catches a glimpse in an
anteroom of several thugs with several young girls one
of whom is Poomina She catches a glimpse of Max as she

disappears past a door A moment later her head peeks
around the door frame She brings her hands together
ASHOKA (0S)
You

Poomina quickly disappears Maxs attention is pulled
back to the godfather
GHATAK
I understand that youre interested
in expanding your clinic and free
school and that you intend to
start treating lepers in the City
of Joy
JOAN
Wed like to better serve the
entire community Mr Ghatak
( )

GHATAK
Of course Thats very good
Admirable And wed be pleased to
rent you suitable space But you
must understand that certain
payments will go up

JOAN
I understand the rent would have
to go up if we rent larger
quarters from you Mr Ghatak but
why should we have to pay more
protection

GHATAK
More people more potential
trouble Strangers If I dont
charge you what will I tell
others

JOAN
But we cant afford it

GHATAK
Surely if you can expand you can
pay more

Joan throws up her hands -- how do you reason with this
man

MAX
Am I stupid but isnt this
protection money money were
paying you to protect us from you

GHATAK
We live in chaotic times Miss
Bethel Doctor I control the
City of Joy and maintain it as a
model of harmony Its a miracle
but a very fragile miracle

MAX
And how are we threatening your
miracle

GHATAK
I admire your courage in choosing
to work in such a violent place
Miss Bethel

(MORE)

GHATAK (CONTD)
Your neighbors in the City of Joy
theyre not educated theyre
given to violence to meanness I
can promise you they wont like
having lepers among them but
because they know youre under my
protection
He dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next
to his right toe and tries to get to his feet The
Goonda hurries forward to help him
GHATAK
Doctor do you like our music

MAX
Well I cant say Ive developed a
craving for it yet

GHATAK
Its difficult to appreciate what
we dont understand isnt it
Let me put it another way The
world is a terrible place Only
the ruthless prevail My son will
make the arrangements with you
One of the thugs helps the godfather outside where in
the bg we see him listening to his music and pottering
in his garden As Max and Joan turn Max finds himself
face to face with Ashoka who wears Maxs necklace and
chai Theres a long pause as the two of them take the
others measure
MAX
(to Ashoka)
I like your taste in neckwear
Joan puts a cautioning hand on Maxs arm Ashoka seems
just the slight bit uneasy dealing with Max and so keeps
trying to direct himself to Joan He smokes a long
Indian cigarette
ASHOKA
The entire package were proposing
will cost you three thousand rupees
a month
Joan is taken aback by the sum
JOAN
If we pay you that we wont have
any money for supplies

ASHOKA
Im told youre very resourceful
MAX

I think I see a solution May I
What if we were to work out a
profit-sharing arrangement We
give you a share of our net profit
ASHOKA
How do you expect to make a profit
off of lepers and the poor Doctor
MAX
Beats the hell outta me asshole
But youve obviously found a way
The question would seem to be whether Ashoka will have
Max killed here or outside the house His eyes on Max
Ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his
hand and smiles at Max

EXT GODFATHERS HOUSE - DAY
Joan is furious
JOAN
Have you gone right off your
rocker These people dont have
a sense of humor Are you trying
to get yourself killed

MAX
I dont think so but with me
any duplicity is possible

He tickles her she knocks his hands away he tickles her
again
JOAN
Stop it you you you nudnick
He doesnt stop and as she storms off down the street
he stays right on her tickling away

INT METAL PIECEWORK SHOP - DAY

unprotected lathes and polishers No one can hear his

minded moment to moment of his various obligations

EXT SIDE STREET - DAY

and Ashoka takes him by the ear

ASHOKA

civilized The son is vicious

Molotov coctails the blows with

iron bars Theyll throw us out

We wont be able to find anyone

else to rent to us Well just

pay
A sigh escapes Surya He shakes his head Eyes
flick at him
ASHISH
What do you say Doctor Big
Brother
SUNIL

I think we must try to break the
Godfathers hold on us

This is startling and is met with a babble of cautious
agreement and dispute
SUNIL
Please hear me out But I think
we have to be very cautious
MAX
How the hell do you proceed with
caution against these people
You cant You have to risk
everything
(MORE)

MAX (CONTD)

You try to negotiate with these

people you make compromises with

them theyll eat you alive Stand

up against them now and theyll

fold I guarantee it Underneath

theyre cowards they got no guts

We show them were strong and

thell just move on to easier

pickings

You put up with this nightmare

telling you if you dont stand
up to that little pimple face
now hell own you for the rest
of your lives
Everyone stares at him Many of them want to buy his
commitment Theres another large sigh from Surya
Aloka and Hasaris eyes bang off of each other she
silently urging him to speak Hes deeply conflicted
and deeply frightened
ANOUAR
Even though I am invisible to some
of you and I dont have a complete
set of legs to stand on I stand
with the Doctor Big Brother Maybe
nature doesnt have a conscience
or those with the power but dont
we
Said the giant mute mades an unintelligible sound in
his throat but clearly hes agreeing with Anouar

MARGARETA

agree with Anouar and Max Daddah
think its worth the chance
Silence until Aloka and Hasaris meet again and out
of his terrible fear and conflict he says very shyly
HASARI
s it permitted to speak
There are quick nods around the room With great difficulty
Hasari says his piece
HASARI
want my children to be educated

and cared for this is our home

we have never had such friends

But many of us owe a great debt

to the Godfather He is strong

and could kill us But we must

choose I trust my Big Brother

I say we must stand up
Theres still dissension but somewhat more support
Said makes a fierce unintelligible supportive sound
Surya sighs again Eyes flick at the old man

SUNIL
Sister Joan what do you think
really

JOAN

Well I think Max has hit on the

heart of what were trying to build

here a self-help society Each

of us has to decide for himself

As for me I suppose I think

really that if the bastards are

going to suck us dry Id like to

get in a couple of good left-

handers before I turn the other

cheek

SALLADIN

But who will rent to us
Surya clucks his tongue and shakes his head everyone
assumes he is preparing a heated refutation of the
resisters His sighs though have been a building
commitment

SURYA

I have a property I will rent you

for two hundred rupees a month

and not a rupee less As for

protection you are on your own

EXT SIDE STREET - DAY
Margareta Manooj Shambu Shoba several other kids and
at the end of the line Poomina all carrying water on
their heads toward the City of Joy Suddenly someone
whispers to Poomina One of Ashokas thugs She glances
after Margareta and the other kids who are turning a
corner and steps into
ALLEYWAY
Where Ashoka waits
ASHOKA

the water pitcher crashes to the ground he puts his
knife into her mouth and lays her face open on both side
with his knife

EXT CITY OF JOY - DAY

Aloka comes TOWARD us leading a group of lepers And
stops Her hand goes to her mouth

THEIR POV - CLINIC - FROM DISTANCE
Two hundred normal people lined up outside the gaily be-
decked dispensary -- many mothers with small children in
their arms Shanta sees Aloka gestures to indicate the
incredible turn-out The normals at the end of the line
turn to look at the approaching LEPERS

LEPER WOMAN

It is too beautiful to believe

As if indeed she were right their path is suddenly cut
off by the Goonda and a commando of thugs armed with
sticks and iron bars backed up by a group carrying
banners with slogans proclaiming in Hindi Urdu English
We Dont Want Lepers Here Theres a sudden uneasy
silence Behind the thugs a short distance is the
policeman who harassed Max earlier and another cop
Joan hurries forward
GOONDA
Good morning Sister to the poor
JOAN
Yes Mr Bhose

GOONDA
Those people arent coming into
this neighborhood

JOAN
They are going to be treated at
the dispensary You have no
right to stop them

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hasari arrives with Max Anouar and Meeta

JOAN
Go ahead Aloka take them inside
The Goonda puts his hand on Aloka The policeman in the
bg keep their distance
JOAN
Take your hands off her you

waster
Joan is seized by a sudden fury and grabs the Goonda
He grabs her much harder Said growls and pushes
forward Several thugs turn step in to neutralize him
Joan elbows the Goonda and tires to westle free of him
As a reflex he raises his hand And as he does its
seized

ANOTHER ANGLE

Max (with Hasari in the bg confused conficted) Max
slings the Goonda against the side of a truck
GOONDA
That was a mistake Doctor

The mistakes yours putz
(to Aloka)

Get these people inside
Aloka starts forward leading the lepers Shes stopped
by a sudden blow from the Goondas stick across her
shoulders knocking her to the ground bleeding from the
neck
Hasari bolts for his wife gets caught up in the melee
Max swings around on the Goonda and for the first time we
realize how strong he is and that he knows how to box
The Goonda goes down and violence erupts Anouar is
chopping at the legs of one of the thugs working on Said
The massive Said tears free and starts to beat the crap
out of the two thugs holding him
The noise brings everyone out of the square those lined
up at the clinic the children from the school
Sunil comes flying out of the clinic
A stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and
those normally in the crowded alley ensues Shanta runs
inside for help Shopkeepers barricade their shop
windows
One of the thugs pours gasoline over Anouar and lights a
match Hasari kneels beside Aloka when he sees the
match ignite the tiny leper Without thinking Hasari
hurls himself on top of Anouar rolling him in the dirt
and against his own body to put out the flames
Joan shouts demanding the violence stop Shes hit
from behind she decides talk isnt going to do it She
grabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight

ANGLE ON DISPENSARY

An EXPLOSION in the doorway scattering anyone who remains
in the area of the dispensary doorway badly wounding
Mehboub

More people with sticks Hasari goes down under several
bodies Max reaches Aloka helps her up sends her toward
the clinic He tears an attacker off of Hasari and they
fight back to back a moment A SECOND EXPLOSION near
them and through the smoke Max sees

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ashoka astride his motorcycle behind his dark glasses
with more thugs these with Molotov cocktails and pick-
axes ready to raze the clinic and school and the
surrounding neighborhood

Sunil drags Mehboub inside

People chant White Monkeys go home White Monkeys
go home No lepers here No lepers here The thugs
cock their iron bars and bricks and Molotov cocktails
Max picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for
Ashoka Suddenly theres a DETONATION followed by a

BLAST of air so fierce Max is thrown to the ground
A bottle of GASOLINE has EXPLODED just behind him Hes
enveloped in smoke

An assailant bears down on Joan with a cutlass As the
assailant is about to strike Hasari seizes the attacker
and hurls him backward Ashish steps in and slashes the
assailant with his own weapon startling even repelling
Hasari
From all over the lane young fighters have come and joined
the fray not bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying
the release Hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a
boy arriving too late to stop the boy from plunging his
nife into the womans belly Hasari fights his way to
the woman but she staggers into the mob
Max knocks down one of the thugs only to have another hand
grasp his shoulder He turns fist cocked to find Poomina
her hands holding her face together Slowly she takes
hands away The sides of her face have been laid open
Max sweeps her up in his arms heads for the clinic
MAX
Oh little girl little girl
Joan is suddenly beside Ashoka
JOAN
Well pay All right then so by
all means protect us
Ashoka raises a hand The Goonda blows a whistle and
the fighting stops as suddenly as it began The com-
batants are breathing heavily There is silence but for
the groans and cries of the wounded and grieving
ASHOKA
In a world such as ours everyone
needs protection For the fee we
discussed from this day forward
I can assure you nothing like this
will happen again

A beat Saladdin is at Joans shoulder Ashoka points
a finger at Hasari
ASHOKA
You I warned you about the
company you keep
He REVS his MOTORCYCLE and SCREECHES away leaving Hasari
staring after him in his dust

a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch (Its dif-
ficult for him to show Ashoka the respect his inherited
position gives him) The Goonda has a bruise under one
eye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday
The air is filled with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF the STREET

come at them
MAX
Time out men Off the street
till this truck passes

The kids move toward the wall of the building theyre
passing but the truck seems to turn toward them seem-
ing not to intend to pass but to hit them
The look on Maxs face lets us know he senses something
terrible is in the offing here He shouts for the kids
to get out of the way shoving the kids closest to him
into a doorway He turns to Shambu whos behind him
calls to him
But in a panic Shambu doesnt move into the shelter of
the building on his right but tries to run across the
street Max leaps for the little boy too late as the
truck just misses Max and clips Shambu hard sending the
little boy flying

tells him to take him to the person in charge

Shambu is fading Aloka smooths the sweat from his brow
trying to keep Shambu alive by force of will and love
Then Max is back standing over her with another man It

the Blood Bank

MAX
Theyll admit him but we have to
pay for the blood I gave him all
I had He wants more Do you have
anything

through his lips indicating its a paltry sum Max
grabs the money and shoves it at the Attendant

Your son thinks I have been

disloyal He took my rickshaw

With my friend I have remade this

one I beg you to let me go again

onto the streets I have my family
The old man looks at the rickshaw at the obvious care
that went into its renovation at this unlikely team
of refurbishers He reaches a shaking hand out toward
a shaft Hasari brings it close The old man rubs the
shaft

GHATAK
It is very beautiful
HASARI
Thank you Babu
GHATAK

HASARI
An allure Babu -- thank you

The Godfather stares at Hasari then at Max
GHATAK

The life of a rickshaw puller is

not one a man would choose if he

had a choice Our feet blister

and burn up from the boiling

asphalt our noses burn from the

fumes of countless motor cars and

buses our backs curve permanently

from the loads we carry hour after

hour day after day But I am

proud to be one of the human horses

who carry my countryman from place

to place and I am thankful for the

opportunity to make a living But

I will not keep silent anymore and

I will not be cheated and

threatened anymore Life is hard
enough No more
Ramatullah starts to applaud Rassoul follows suit
The Judge bangs his gavel

rupees As he reaches into his pocket for his screw
of money a hand suddenly protrudes into the cage through
the bars

instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of
scissors to the floor Simultaneously they bend to pick
it up and bang heads

shoulders the two of them leading a terrible ensemble
version of Hound Dog An air of festivity among
lepers and rescuers
They come to a bridge made of two planks over rushing
water

Several rickshaws go across but as Max and Anouar start
over suddenly the ground gives way beneath Maxs feet
Anouar falls free someone grabs him but a blackish
stream rushes into Maxs mouth and in an instant hes
swept beneath the gurgling filth The density of the
filth makes his effort to surface ineffective It
looks for all the world like hes going to drown

ON OTHERS
Max has disappeared Instinctively Hasari dives into
the maelstrom He too disappears After some moments
Hasari surfaces spitting the filth out of his mouth
He dives again comes up somewhere else Dives a third
time Is down Is down Is down Then suddenly

bursts out of the filth dragging the unconscious form
of Max Loeb into the air More people have gathered
Cries of

OTHERS

Its the doctor Save Doctor Big

Brother
Aloka passes a baby to someone and helps Hasari push
Max up onto the bank But now Hasari doesnt know
what to do and turns to his wife
Aloka quickly clears Maxs mouth and begins to admin-
ister mouth-to-mouth resuscitation She blows she
breathes she blows she breathes People crowd in
Aloka blows she breathes It seems though that by
his stillness and by the looks on peoples faces that
Max is dead Yet more determined still Aloka goes
on blows breathes

And now Max gags his body erupts in spasm and he
explodes a stream of black liquid out of his lungs
Aloka supports his forehead as Max retches again and
then comes still A beat

eyes at all of them with utterly open love Amrita
holds out a small gift to him Its a banana leaf
holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little
decorative leaves
MAX

EXT RAMS HUT - TWO MONTHS LATER - DAY

A group gathered on a dry sunny afternoon peering into
the hut We FOCUS on the growing flower in the tea

caddy in the window and then go THROUGH the window into

INT PALS ROOM - DAY
Hasari Max (dressed quite India) the local Hara Giri
Mr Ghosh and the four Ghosh uncles crammed into the
tiny room Members of our group jam the doorway
spectating The air is close

HASARI

Mr Ghosh lights up a bidi looks at his brothers

up for what is lacking

SUBASHS FATHER

HASARI

rajah might be worth that and

Impossible

We linger on Shambu a moment

INT ST PIUS SCHOOL - HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - DAY
Sister Cecilia in full habit looks over a sheaf of
test scores

Then she peers up at
ANOTHER ANGLE
Manooj seated between Hasari and Max
SISTER CECILIA

Well indeed I think Sister Joan

is right -- weve got a prospect

here Well start you off with a

few classes if that works out

Hasari cant believe his ears Manooj sits frozen Max

grins

EXT NARROW LANE - NEAR CITY OF JOY - DAY

Amrita Subash and Shambu heading home from the work-
shop Shambus cast is gone Subash flirts with
Amrita They see Hasari Max and Manooj coming toward
them Manooj runs to them shouting that hes going to
the school Amrita Subash Shambu congratulate him

HASARI AND MAX

Suddenly the rickshaw wheels jam They turn to find
two men one of whom has slammed a stick into Hasaris
spokes Retribution it would seem has arrived

The kids stop huddle instinctively together in fear
Our policeman disappears into a doorway as shutters
close up and down this little street There are thugs
at both ends No one else is visible on the street
The two men stare at Hasari a moment smiling Then
one gets into the rickshaw crosses his legs as if he
might want transport But now he whips out a narrow
bladed knife and still staring at Hasari begins to
slice up the newly covered seats of the rickshaw Max
looks around trying to cool things

MAX
Hey come on dont do this
VOICE
Well whats the problem here
They turn Ashoka Behind him the Goonda
ASHOKA

Youve become very brave of late
havent you

MAX
Dont do this

ASHOKA
Oh I do what I please You see
my fathers dead Im in charge
now So you will get off my
streets you will leave my
country and that clinic and
school will close

MAX
Why
ASHOKA
My father was weak He let you
and your European friend give
these little people ideas Its
over
MAX
You cant do this
He takes no more than a step at Ashoka a hand coming up
when hes hit hard from behind Goes to his knees

MAX
Jesus Christ
His hand comes away from the back of his head with blood
He tries to rise and is hit again
HASARI
(to the kids)
Get back Stay back
ASHOKA
No no come forward Come
Ashoka glides toward the petrified Amrita The Goonda
remains unmoving watchful Ashoka puts out his hand
with its rings and strokes Amritas cheek
ASHOKA
What a little woman already hey
HASARI
Please dont touch her Babu
ASHOKA
What did you say
HASARI
I said Please dont touch her
Hasari glances over his shoulder his eyes bouncing off
the Goondas impassive face Now the knife comes out of
Ashokas pocket snaps open glints in the light
ASHOKA
Shes going to give someone a lot
of enjoyment Yes
( )

Theres a moment of unbearable tension as everyone in-
cluding the Goonda realizes this man is out of control
ASHOKA
(to the Goonda)

He said please didnt he

Please dont touch her
The Goonda stares at Ashoka And now Ashoka reaches out
and we FOLLOW CLOSE on his hand as it moves ever so
slowly through space to settle on Amritas breast
And now Hasari explodes He hits Ashoka A hard punch
to the chest Ashoka stumbles and falls to one knee

The Two Thugs make a move to come to his rescue but a
curious thing stops them the Goondas arm outstretched
across their path his eyes alerting them not to proceed
Max lurches to his feet unsteadily

ASHOKA

Bhose help me
Hasari unloads a punch into Ashokas face Ashokas nose
pours blood he starts to whimper He clutches Hasari
hard to him Holds him Hasari struggles slams his
palm into Ashokas chin sending Ashoka to the ground
sending the knife skidding across the ground Hasari
grabs the knife straddles Ashoka about to kill But he
cant do it

HASARI

Life is hard enough No more

Leave us alone
Hasari backs off leans against a wall stares down at
Ashoka his hands in tight against his body
Manooj and Shambu stare at their father in awe
Shambu sees something on the ground where the first blow
was delivered to Ashokas chest Everyone has moved
slightly to one side He bends and closes his fist
around something
The Goonda steps between Ashoka and Max and Hasari

GOONDA

You wont be bothered again
A look from the Goonda and the Thugs vanish leaving
Ashoka cowering in a doorway on his knees

Shutters start to open people begin to appear again in
doorways and windows
Fearing for his life Ashoka suddenly bolts
Max is fixed on Hasari He lets up a scream of exulta-
tion his hand going out for a five from Hasari The
kids charge toward Hasari
Then everyone freezes
Hasari lists to his right side and blood starts to pour
from the knife wound in his abdomen under his pressing
arm
EXT MAXS ROOM - UPSTAIRS BALCONY - NIGHT

From here we can see Hasari on Maxs cot under The Raft
of the Medusa in the little room overlooking the street
Out here the two doctors are alone
MAX

Why dont you go on home Tll

stay with him
Sunil nods Max grips Sunils hand strongly Sunil goes
down the steps Max moves to Hasaris bedside He
watches Hasari breathing He looks up at The Raft of
the Medusa

INT MAXS ROOM - NIGHT (SEVERAL HOURS LATER)
A thin stream of dawn light coming through the half-
closed shutters

FROM HERE - THE BALCONY

Through the open door we can just see Joan praying
quietly Close around her Anouar Meeta Surya Marga-
reta Poomina

THE ROOM
Beneath The Raft of the Medusa Hasari Pal speaks to
his family and Max Aloka sitting close to the bed the
Children on the bed beside their father and Max standing
close

HASARI

A mans journey to the end of his

obligations is a very long road

And you have to remember that you

can never give up We pray that

life will bless us that we will

be kings with possessions and

money that we can rule over all

around us But its a mist the

only thing that makes it possible

to endure life is our love one

for the other
A beat the family and Max tightly bound together And
now we hear the dim sounds of RICKSHAW BELLS

HASARI
I was dreaming the sound of
rickshaw bells and now I hear
them
Max opens the windows Manooj helps his father sit up
COURTYARD - THEIR POV
Outside there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard
and spilling out into the street When the window opens
all the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is
full of their music
HASARI

Are they here for me

Unquestionably they are

HASARI
A city so big When we arrived
we didnt have a place to live a
friend
He smiles

OUTSIDE
The many hands with their ringing bells

CLOSE ON WINDOW
The tiny figure of Shambu joins Max in the window Max

bends close

SHAMBU
(whispering)
Is my father going to die
Max makes the same sound he made in the ashram at the
beginning of the movie though this sound of dismissal
different
MAX
Get serious

INT RAMS HUT - HASARIS FACE - DAY
Hasari mirrors Maxs expression of dismissal

HASARI
Get serious Ive agreed to the
bicycle Ive agreed to the 1000
rupees I can go no further I
have nothing more to give

OUTSIDE THE HUT
Everyone crowded around the door From within we DIMLY
HEAR the negotiations continue Max approaches from the
clinic Shambu slips down the steps from above as
MAX
Hows it going
RAM
All that stands between them now
is the ounce of gold Max

Daddah Joan Di -- is she a good
reader

MAX
What do you mean

RAM

She read this letter to me
( he shows Max)

But I think she must have read it
wrong She said my wife writes
that irrigation has come to our
village

MAX
But thats great

( )

RAM
But it means I should go home to
my wife
MAX
I thought thats why weve been
writing all these letters
RAM
Yes of course I love her from
here yes but what if I go home
and find I dont love her from
there
Shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the
edge of the tea shop The little boy indicates Max
should bend close Max leans down

SHAMBU
Daddy needs gold right
Max nods And Shambu brings his fist up from under the

table

CLOSE ON SHAMBUS HAND
He opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off the
ground during the fight Maxs necklace and Hebrew
letter
SHAMBU
Do you think this is pretend gold
or real

MAX AND SHAMBU
Max stares at the little boys hopeful face

INT PALS ROOM - FLOWER
We see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy and
then Hasaris fingers come INTO THE FRAME He carefully
snips the flower free of its stalk

ANOTHER ANGLE
Amrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father bought
her Father and daughter are alone He hands her the

flower and adjusts her veil tenderly
( )

HASARI

You never did belong to me You

were only lent to me by God until

you marry and continue the wheel

of life
Amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms
come up around his neck the flower against his curved
back Tears fill Hasaris eyes but a smile graces his
lips

EXT SQUARE - DAY - EARLY EVENING

The procession to the courtyard begins when a BRASS BAND
strikes up accompanied by singing and shouting Tiny
lights have been strung over the street We see Max and
Manubai Margareta and a group of children Joan with
Poomina Anour Meeta Said Everyone whos become part
of the family is present

EXT CLINIC COURTYARD - DAY (DUSK)

The procession arrives and enters Smoke from the chu-

las Light from a half dozen lamps

Subash and his procession make their entrance A ritual

veil is fixed to Subashs face The Pujari waves for

Hasari to come to his place Hasari turns to Max
HASARI

I would be pleased if you would

stand with me in the place of

honor to the right of my daughter

Deeply touched Max nods and the two men step for-
ward as Subash is motioned forward by the Pujari
Subash sits beside Amrita

THE CEREMONY

A flame The shyness of bride and groom as the ceremony
proceeds with the winding of the red thread Hasari
looks on with unspeakable pride Max beside him We see
the faces of all our family again Aloka Manooj and
Shambu Joan Poomina Surya Selima Aristotle John
etc

THE WHEEL
Turning As Amrita and Subash joined by the thread
circle the flame as we PULL BACK AND UP Now we see
the clinic and school and the surrounding area the
alleys full of people and activity As we continue to
PULL BACK we see the entirety of the City of Joy and
then beyond -- Calcutta its teeming streets -- life con-
tinuing as the sun sets against an infinite sky and we
ROLL END CREDITS

FADE OUT

THE END
