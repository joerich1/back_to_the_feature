It nearly fills the screen swimming mysteriously in the
warm late summer air

SOUND Crickets

EXT TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT
CREDITS BEGIN

A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks Aboard is
ARNIE WESTRUM a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino
pants He is drinking beer

ARNIE (sings)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer

He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses
it to one side Up ahead we see a switching point

ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral opens the toolbox
on the back and brings out a big five-cell flashlight He
shines it on the switch

He gets a crowbar from the toolbox plus a big wrench a
pair of pliers a hammer and a pair of work gloves He also
gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back
pocket

ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch

CREDITS CONTINUE

EXT ARNIE AT THE SWITCHING POINT NIGHT

light on the switch for a moment During this

ARNIE (sings)
Its not bitter not sweet its a real
frosty treat wont you try wont you
buy Rheingold beer
He tries the switch No go Its frozen

ARNIE
Stuck tightern dogshit in a deep freeze

He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones He pops the cap and
drinks deeply He burps Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it wont fall over Then
he picks up his crowbar

CREDITS CONTINUE

EXT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT

Theres a SOUND of bushes shaking Something comes out -
something huge It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider It is
a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes Tatters of clothes
still hang from it

What kind of monster exactly It is humanoid as well as
wolfish and when we learn who it is in its human form we
should be able to spot the resemblance at onceand kick
ourselves for not knowing earlier

It crouches there huge and bushy and fanged and deadly on
the whole rail-rider

CREDITS CONCLUDE

EXT ARNIE NIGHT
Hes working the crowbar into the junction point just as
hard as he can Swearing at it under his breath Suddenly

both the tracks and the switch move

ARNIE
Hot damn Now a little oil

He turns back toward the rail-rider

EXT ARNIE ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT

ARNIE
Its not bitter not sweet its
a big fuckin treat

A NOISE - bushes rattling cinders clinking and rattling
ARNIE looks around

Nothing there His bottle of beer stands by the litter of
his tools
EXT ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
Hes rooting around in the toolbox back to the switching
point
EXT ARNIES BOTTLE OF BEER CU NIGHT
A hairy handpaw closes around it - we see huge curved claws
on that hand
EXT THE WEREWOLFS FACE CU NIGHT
Glaring green-yellow eyes a savage beastial face which is
still half human Thats all we see The rest is in shadow
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer Foamy
Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolfs throat
EXT ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT
He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan the kind with the
long spout He starts back to the switching point waving
the can
ARNIE (sings)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer

Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer

He arrives looks down and stops singing His eyes widen

EXT THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK ARNIES POV NIGHT
We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer but it is of

course empty Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders
half wolf half human

EXT ARNIE NIGHT

Hes beginning to be afraid Beginning to look around to see
what might be out here with him Beginning to realize he is
in extremely deep shit

SOUND A SHATTERING SNARLING ROAR

EXT THE WEREWOLF NIGHT

It rises up on its hind legs eyes glaring an ugly yellow
green Its snout wrinkles back revealing those teeth

EXT ARNIE NIGHT

Hes craning back to look at the thing his face a grue of
horror

ARNIE
Oh n-

A huge clawed handpaw comes sweeping down ARNIEs head is

granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his
body

EXT THE RAIL-RIDER NIGHT

SOUND of the beast approaching A hairy arm and taloned hand
reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages
The hand is dripping blood

It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold

The WEREWOLF begins to sing It is a bizarre funny-horrible
grunting the words hellishly recognizable

WEREWOLF (gutteral subhuman)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer

No bottle opener for this thing it brings the neck of the

bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox Beer foams
out

EXT THE WEREWOLFS FACE IN DEEP SHADOW NIGHT

HeIt rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth
and drinks Foam drizzles down its pelt Its grinning

WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer
EXT THE WEREWOLF CU NIGHT

The bottle is empty There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins
to eat the bottle

Blood begins to run out of its mouth its face wrinkles in
pain and fury It spits out broken bloody jags of glass

Looks up It HOWLS

EXT TARKERS MILLS NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

Were looking at Main Street of a small country town - might
be New England might be mid-South Might be 1984 might be
1981 This is Tarkers Mills and in places like this time
moves more slowly Cars - not too many - move back and
forth No one is in a hurry

We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door)
Andys Sporting Goods Owens Pub with its Narragansett
neon sign We see a barber shop with a striped pole we see
the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door
We see the Gem Theater which is showing a revival of Sophia
Loren in Two Women

Its Our Town USA

JANE (voice-over)
This place is Tarkers Mills where I
grew up and this is how it was when I
was fourteen - a place where people cared
about each other as much as they cared
about themselves This is how my town
looked as all unknowing it approached the
rim of the nightmare The killing had begun

SOUND The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant a bit dreamy

EXTINT TARKERS MILLS MONTAGE NIGHT

a) VIRGIL CUTTS owner of Virgils Texaco is filling up a
car We hear the HOWl and VIRGIL looks up uneasily

b) In the barber shop BILLY McCLAREN the barber is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister REV OBANION
They both look around

c) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater They pause at

the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town

EXT THE SETTING MOON CU NIGHT
As JANE speaks we see the moon sink below the horizon

JANE (v-o)
The killing had begun but at first no
one knew it Arnie Westrum was a chronic
drunk and what happened seemed like an
accident

EXT THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIES HEADLESS BODY NIGHT

Slowly the view improves grows lighter as we TIME-LAPSE TO
DAWN

SOUND A train is approaching We hear its horn

CAMERA MOVES IN Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle There
is a litter of ARNIES tools And here on the cheek of
ARNIES severed head a few ants are checking things out

SOUND The trains horn MUCH CLOSER

JANE (v-o)
The county coroner concluded that Arnie
passed out on the tracks There wasnt
enough evidence to conclude anything else

And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame horn
blaring The rail-rider goes flying ARNIES body disappears
underneath We see something flopping and moving under
there It could be a bundle of rags Could be but isnt

DISSOLVE TO

EXT TARKERS MILLS TOWN COMMON DAY

The common is more or less in the center of town either
surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent thats been erected on
the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent almost but
the banner draped over the entrance reads SUPPORT THE
TARKERS MILLS MEDCU DRIVE

Behind or to the side on the grass picnic tables have been
set out end-to-end Women are putting salads and home-baked

breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit

down to a meal when the meetings over Further off men are
tending barbecues roasting corn etc

JOE HALLER (amplified voice)
Id like to give you Father Lester Lowe
of Holy Family Catholic Church

Enthusiastic applause greets this

INT THE CROWD DAY

Most of the town is here seated on folding chairs Were
looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW her
husband BOB and their fourteen-year-old daughter JANE It
is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard
speaking She is now a bit bored with the meeting which has
been going on for some time As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES she
leans toward her mother

JANE

brothers all right

As JANE gets up the applause starts to fade a bit

NOTE JANE is wearing a silver crucifix and will continue

Good-natured laughter greets this

INT LOWE AT THE PODIUM

A bit flustered he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF
SCREAM OF FEEDBACK

LOWE
For the last ten years I have had a
dream A dream of a time when modern
medical care would come to this small
community which sometimes seems so far
from Durham with her lifesaving
hospitals I hope that this meeting at
which I see so many of my friends
gathered will be the start of making my
dream come true

SOUND Enthusiastic applause

EXT A SNAKE IN THE GRASS CU

Its a blacksnake harmless but big It goes wriggling
through the grass toward a stream In the bg - SOUND OF
APPLAUSE

MARTY (voice)
Holy Brady are you sure theyre
not poisonous
BRADY (voice)
Little old blacksnake Hell no

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -
grab the blacksnake

respectful wonder

sees

EXT JANE COMING OUT OF THE TENT DAY

JANE (v-o)
I was almost fifteen that summer My
brother Marty was eleven Marty and his
friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I
had to bear Brady was actually the worse
of the two but I was rarely disposed to
see that Not when my younger brother was
so constantly thrown in my face by my
parents

LOWE (v-o from the tent)
32000 is a lot of money But when you
think of the lives this unit might save it

seems very inexpensive indeed

Applause greets this

EXT MARTY AND BRADY

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from
waist or chest height BRADY snatches back the snake

BRADY
I got an idea

MARTY
What

BRADY looks toward JANE MARTY follows his gaze His eyes
widen

MARTY
You wouldnt

BRADY grins MARTY assesses the grin

MARTY
You would

INT THE PODIUM WITH LOWE

LOWE
An endeavor like this seems to me to be
the very definition of community - all
of us pulling together as one farmers
and merchants Protestants and Catholics

EXT JANE

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area and is passing
under a tree Theres more applause from the tent

BRADY (teasing voice)
Jane Jane

She looks up The blacksnake dangles down toward her almost

STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)
Wait Dont go

Startled JANE looks around instinctively yanking her dress
down No one in sight

MAN (voice rough)
Just leave me alone

Now she looks toward

EXT THE BANDSTAND JANES POV
A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who
has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about
the farmers daughter comes striding down from the
bandstand

the stairs but does not descend them She is also crying -

Bg SOUNDS More applause

EXT JANE

We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the
bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand
JANE looks suddenly aware that shes not the only one in
this sad world who has troubles She reaches the foot of the
stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose
absently in a litter can

JANE mounts the steps timidly

JANE
Stella Is that you

EXT ON THE BANDSTAND

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches where she is
bawling into a handful of Kleenex Pudgy and twenty-two she
is both funny and terribly sad She looks around at the
sound of JANEs voice

STELLA (alarmed)
Who -

JANE (approaching closer)
Its Jane Stella Jane Coslaw

STELLA sees it is and turns away from her still weeping
JANE stands uncertain what to do next After a moment she
approaches closer and touches STELLAS turned back timidly

JANE (tenderly)
Whats wrong

STELLA (weeping)
Hes going away I know he is

JANE
Whos going away

STELLA turns to her weeping still and distracted

STELLA
What am I going to tell my mother If

tell my mother

JANE (bewildered)
Stella I dont know what-

STELLA
Oh leave me alone Just leave me

STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps

stares after her bewildered and perhaps even a little
frightened

MARTY
Jane I-

NAN

scraped knee in his whole life

Well here it is - the chief source of JANES animus against
her brother and the source of most of the tension in the
COSLAW family

MARTY winces and turns away a little embarrassed - this
always happens He doesnt like it but he doesnt know how

to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it

JANE
You always take his side because hes a
cripple Well its not my fault that hes

both whiskey and beer An ashtray beside him overflows with
butts

Aww Mom-

INT THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME

MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the
second floor He looks dejected and glum

SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL I dont think we can
make out all of whats going on but weve all known women
like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks Christian
household you come here drunk and expect cant even
bother to call ahead Etc etc

A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing This one is
no Silver Bullet only the more humble sort that moves by
arm power When the stair chair clicks to a stop MARTY
hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down
the hall toward the bathroom

Below NANS rant is still going on

INT THE DEN WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL NIGHT

UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I
mean he is really drunk Hes smoking one cigarette another
is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray He drops a pile
of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the
table bending down to pick them up

NAN
I dont want you drinking around Marty
Thats too much If you cant stop it
you better stay away

AL straightens up There is a sort of command force in this
man and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal
drunkenness so we can see it

UNCLE AL
I come here because Marty needs a friend

NAN
Yes youve always been that to him
But if you cant leave your booze in
whatever dump you call home you better
just stay away

She leaves the room almost crying UNCLE AL looks after
her and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering
ashtray He pours beer over the mess putting out the fire
but creating something that looks even worse He begins
drunkenly picking up again

UNCLE AL (to himself)
Another wonderful time at Sister Nans

hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two
of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-

INT UNCLE AL MARTY TAMMY AND MRS STURMFULLER IN A PEW

As we look at them from left to right UNCLE AL MARTY
TAMMY MRS STURMFULLER

UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his
hip pocket Engraved on it in Old English letters is the
word rotgut He spins the cap and takes a quick knock He
pauses and glances at MARTY who looks deeply stunned

JANE (v-o continues)
they didnt at all mind drafting him
As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may
have been able to offer him

UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY MARTY looks at him
questioningly for a moment and then drinks MARTY looks at
TAMMY who looks frankly terrible Her mother is looking
away MARTY nudges her She looks around at him He offers
her the flask Her eyes widen

JANE (v-o continues)
I now believe that was best kept between
the two of them

After a brief moments consideration TAMMY takes the flask
and has a deep swallow She hands the flask back to MARTY
who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs Her
mother looks at her then at MARTY and UNCLE AL UNCLE AL
smiles sympathetically hiding the flask with one hand as
if to say Isnt it a terrible thing MRS STURMFULLER
looks distractedly back toward the service

JANE (v-o concludes)
or among the three of them

UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing

of comfort to you if I could

He looks out at them

INT THE CONGREGATION

They look back at LOWE hoping for some help in
understanding this awful thing

INT LOWE ABOVE THE COFFIN

LOWE
If there is any word of comfort I can give
you its just this the face of the beast
always becomes known the time of the beast
always passes

He is struggling with this trying dreadfully hard

LOWE
If there are times when we feel alone and
afraid only small creatures in the dark
then these are the times when we must turn
to one another for our comfort and our hope
To our neighbors To our community To our
love for each other I alone cannot ease
the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid nor can
I ease your pain nor you ease mine But if
I believe anything its this we can comfort
each other We can heal each other We can
go on together
INT THE CONGREGATION WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

The kids are crying MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she
puts her head on his shoulder

INT FATHER LOWE

LOWE
The Bible tells us not to fear the terror
that creepeth by night or that which flieth
by noonday and yet we do we do Because
there is much we dont know and we feel
very small But we must not be alone We must
not allow ourselves to be alone for there is
the wide gate to the hell of terror Turn to
each other Join hands in your sorrow and try
to remember that the face of the beast always
becomes known (Pause) The time of the beast
always passes (Pause) Let us pray

six west of Carson Creek

The door at the back opens HALLER and PETE come in JOE
HALLER is in extremely bad shape He hasnt come back much
from the murder of BRADY I believe he is having some sort
of spiritual crisis and while it is not our purpose to
explore what it might be- this is after all a horror movie
and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has
seriously weakened his authority

ANDY (continuing)
Moonrise at 852 pm

Some nervous laughter greets this Meanwhile HALLER and
PETE are working their way to the front where they end up
next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID

HALLER looks at him for a moment then turns to look at the
crowd They look rather like a lynch mob on their faces we
see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination HALLER
speaks with a kind of haggard fading desperation

HALLER
The law has a name for what you men are
planning Its private justice and private
justice is about a step anda half away
from lynch mobs and hang ropes Im no
J Edgar Hoover but I am the law in Tarkers
Mills and I want you men to go home

They shuffle their feet uneasily many look down He is
getting to them

ANDY
Dont let this guy scare you Whats he done

since this thing started but hang his face out

Its not working Many of the men look disgusted with both
ANDY and themselves

ANDY (louder)
He aint got so much as a fingerprint

OWEN KNOPFLER
Ah shut up Andy

ANDY
Dont tell me to-

HERB KINCAID steps forward

HERB
Yes Correct Shut up

ANDY surprised and bewildered does HERB turns and looks
grimly at JOE HALLER who can barely meet his gaze

HERB (quietly)
I just came from my boys funeral

HALLER
HerbI know how upset- how grief-stricken
you must bebut-

HERB (quietly)
He was torn apart

Utter silence in OWENS place now The others are staring
rapt

HALLER
Yes Yes but-

HERB (still quiet)
Upset you say Grief-stricken you say
Constable you dont know what those words
mean My son was torn to pieces To pieces

HERB turns to the others in the pub Tears stream down his
face

HERB
My son was torn to pieces

(turning back to HALLER)
You come in here and talk to these men
about private justice You dare to do that
Constable Haller why dont you go out to
Harmony Hill and dig up whats left of Brady
and explain to him about private justice
Would you want to do that

HALLER makes no reply He looks down at his feet

HERB
No I thought not

(to the others)
You folks stay here if you want I wouldnt
ask anyone to do anything that runs counter
to his conscience As for me Im going out
and hunt up a little private justice

ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again He grins poisonously at
the slumped HALLER He pushes off after HERB KINCAID Other
men start to follow
EXT OWENS PUB

Men are streaming out getting into station wagons and
pickup trucks Engines roar into life They begin backing
out even as more men come out of the pub We even hear some
high-spirited yells they are on their way and their blood
is up

INT OWENS PUB

LESTER LOWE looking more distressed than ever pushes his
way through the men toward the door and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS
He grabs BILLY McCLAREN

BILLY (not looking at LOWE)
Joes had his chance Father Leave me be

He pushes outside LOWE looks around wildly his face says
he cant believe this is happening He grabs PORTER
ZINNEMAN then as PORTER shoves by him at a couple of
others with mounting desperation

HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and
draws him aside

HALLER
Let them go

LOWE
But-

HALLER
This is that spirit of community you were
talking about Grand aint it Maybe theyll
shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can
mount the head and raffle it off To benefit
the Medcu van of course

HALLER laughs

LOWE
But cant we do anything

OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them he has a rifle over one
shoulder in a sling In his left hand he carries the
peacemaker bat
HALLER
Sure We can pray to Christ that none of them
get killed

give you its just this the face of the

formerly there are now six coffins smothered with flowers

happening to JOES face It is bulging changing He looks
up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green The pupils are
split He grins showing big teeth

They are all changing Among the things we see are

PETE SYLVESTER who is a church deacon rushing down the
aisle changing snarling He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two
of them grapple in the aisle

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket
covering the babys face and we see its a wolfling already
the YOUNG WOMANS own hands are turning into claws

TAMMY STURMFULLER changing PELTZER the druggist changing
the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing

At the organ MRS BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters
of a silk bombazine dress sheit is still wearing a veiled
hat on her head and she is beating the shit out of the
organ keys with her clawed hands She sounds like Jerry Lee
Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies And now the
tune changes from the remnants of Bringing In The Sheaves
It changes into the Rheingold jingle

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer

them through a stained-glass window Some of the werewolves-—
for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the
aisles The rest sway back and forth grinning ferociously

frosty treat

And ANDY FAIRTON who now looks as wolflike as any of them
bites the hands claw off

INT REV LOWE ON THE PODIUM

Hes seen all he can stand He whirls for the back where
there is a small door He pulls it open and a BRADY

zombie werewolf if you can dig it- George Romero would like
it I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE

BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWES NECK

Roman candles twizzers smoke bombs etc

An expression of sublime delight fills MARTYS face as he
inventories these goodies

EXT THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE NIGHT

Theres a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows Now
the window goes up and MARTY leans out He grasps the
downspout and begins working his way down This should not
be too hard for us to believe weve already seen how strong
MARTYS arms are

His legs dangle limply but hes doing just fine When he
reaches the bottom of the drainpipe they simply crumple
under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the
back porch

MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail Here under a
tarp is the Silver Bullet MARTY pushes the tarp aside and
gets in He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the
porch ramp and rolls silently down it At the bottom he
looks up at

Thinks a bit then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward

exertion hes still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of
silence and its hard work He stops at the line of bushes
and gets the bag of fireworks He puts it on his lap and
starts moving again

EXT THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY FROM THE ROAD

The driveway has a slight downslant and MARTY coasts easily
out to the road He turns right and begins to roll slowly
along the verge of the highway still using his hands We
can see that the light is still on upstairs MARTY turns
back once to verify this himself then keeps on going Hes
not going to be deprived of his treat

EXT MARTY

He decides hes far enough away to be safe He pushes the
starter button The engine cranks coughs and cranks some
more MARTY frowns and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary
choke I suppose He pushes the starter button again It
cranks but doesnt start

MARTY pushes in the wire looking concerned now and tries
again This time after the engine has cranked over a few
times it starts

MARTY (softly)
All right

He puts it in gear and starts off

EXT A ROADSIDE TURNOUT NIGHT
SOUND Fast-rushing water

The turnout is packed dirt Theres a grove of trees with
picnic tables spotted among them at the back The sign in
the extreme fg reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top AUGER
FALLS in the middle TOWNSHIP OF TARKERS MILLS at the
bottom

SOUND The Silver Bullet approaching
MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area He
stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of
fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time
selecting the first- hes like a wine fancier with a whole
cellar of rare bottles to choose from At last he chooses a
twizzer He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top
and lights the fuse
When it starts to fizz MARTY tosses it high into the air
MARTY (soft)
Heres one for the good guys

EXT THE TWIZZER

It flies in an arc over the drop

EXT THE TWIZZER FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT

THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of
the waterfalls catch pool
SOUND Growling

EXT THE CREEK WITH THE WEREWOLF
It has been drinking from the creek It looks more than half
human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure but

its face is in shadow

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs

EXT THE TWIZZER ON THE ROCKS

Its guttering out A hand-paw touches it and draws back
quickly

SOUND Hurt angry growl

EXT MARTY IN THE REST AREA
Hes getting ready to light one of the fountains He pauses
and looks toward the cut Hes heard something- but the
waterfall muffles it He lights the fountains fuse sets it
on the ground and rolls the Bullet back a few feet
The fountain bursts into a shower of light
MARTY (delighted)

All right

EXT THE SLOPE OF THE CUT MEDIUM LONG

The waterfall is in the bg

The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope

EXT THE FOUNTAIN CU

It goes out

EXT MARTY

He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse The
Roman candle shoots into the sky
EXT THE ROMAN CANDLE

Bursts into colored light

EXT THE WEREWOLF NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT MEDIUM LONG

It GROWLS and shakes its fists at the fading light in the
sky

EXT MARTY

Hes holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in
the other Hes looking toward the cut and the waterfall

MARTY
Is someone there

EXT THE WEREWOLF NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT

It freezes GROWLING FAINTLY

EXT MARTY

With a little shrug he lights the fuse on the fountain and
sets it on the ground as before

EXT THE BACK OF THE GROVE AT THE TOP OF THE CUT

Claw-hands settle over the top

EXT THE FOUNTAIN CU

It throws off fiery swirls of sparks then begins to die
down

EXT MARTY

Hes checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice
when he hears a clear SOUND A SNAPPING SPLINTERING BRANCH

EXT THE GROVE WITH THE WEREWOLF

Its run into a low-hanging branch Instead of pushing it
aside or ducking under it it simply rips it off the tree
Although the branch is pretty big the WEREWOLF does this as
easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a
Thanksgiving turkey It throws the branch aside and
advances hunched over on two legs

EXT MARTY

MARTY (terrified)
Whos there

EXT THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA MARTYS POV

The grove is a darkened shadowland

EXT MARTY
He punches the Bullets starter The motor cranks and
cranks No go though MARTY pulls out the choke wire

alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with
terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard

EXT THE GROVE MARTYS POV

Here it comes out of the shadows closing in

EXT MARTY

Working that starter for all its worth but the motor
only cranks Still no start

EXT CLAWED FURRY FEET

EXT MARTY

He gives up on the motor He looks toward the picnic table
where the fireworks are He grabs up the tracer He gets the
matches out of the breast pocket of his pjs and promptly
drops them in his lap He scrabbles for them

EXT THE WEREWOLF MARTYS POV

We cant see its face in the dark but its closer much
closer
EXT MARTY
He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same
time
He cant to do that hed need at least one more hand He
puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries
again
EXT THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTYS HANDS
He strikes the match too hard It bends the neck broken
MARTY (voice moaning)
Oh please

EXT WEREWOLF CLAWS OPENING AND CLOSING

EXT MARTY

He is in an extremity of terror

EXT THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTYS HANDS CU

He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it It
lights

EXT THE WEREWOLF

It recoils- we still cant see its face except for a vague
shadow

(NOTE I keep emphasizing the shadowed face because this is
not a full-moon period Ive been going on the assumption
that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness
toothiness hairiness etc starting with a partial change
at about the second quarter Its a process like the tide
coming in Thus if we saw MARTYS attacker clearly at this
point I think we would recognize him)

EXT MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to
the fuse It splutters alight
EXT MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF A WIDER SHOT
The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away The tracer
flares alight and shoots out of MARTYS hand leaving a

pink-orange trail of smoke behind it The missile flies at
the WEREWOLFs head

EXT THE WEREWOLF

The tracer strikes it in the face and we see a flash of
fire The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away

EXT MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He punches the starter again The motor cranks

EXT THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET

The motor coughs and fires a big blue flame jumps from the
fancy carb and the engine starts to run

EXT THE WEREWOLF

Its staggering away ROARING and HOWLING The tube of the
tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye in
fact- like an Indians arrow The WEREWOLF smashes branches
out of its way

EXT MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road gasping
and weeping with fear

EXT THE WEREWOLF IN THE GROVE

Its blundering through the trees It pulls the tube from
its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it

EXT THE TRACER CU

It lies smoldering on the ground The end is slick with
blood
EXT THE ROAD WITH MARTY

The Bullet is really wheeling MARTY is panting out of
breath still deeply frightened

EXT THE WOODS WITH THE WEREWOLF

We see it blundering along holding its face blood bubbles
through its fingers

WEREWOLF (snarling voice)

EXT CHASE MONTAGE

The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple
LOWE is chasing MARTYs hopped-up wheelchair along a country
road at speeds approaching fifty MPH MARTY should have a
couple of near misses and perhaps we could actually have
him pass one car At one point we should have a REVERSE
ANGLE on LESTER LOWES coupe featuring two bumper stickers

gaining MARTY looks increasingly desperate And now he

greatest sin a man or a woman can commit
Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide
if she had done so she would be burning in
hell right now By killing her I took her
physical life but saved her life eternal
You see Marty You see how all things serve
the will and the mind of God You see you
meddling little shit

MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL JANE is behind them knocking
croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn

MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls
over
UNCLE AL
Well its a lot easier to swallow
without the hair and the foaming jaws
Also I checked on the otic solution
It was counter brand No prescription
needed

MARTY
I told you

UNCLE AL
Shut up dear boy- no gloating allowed

JANE (sits down)
Did you talk to the constable

UNCLE AL
After Marty called me with his latest
Thrilling Tale of Wonder I did (Pause)
Hes had no poison-pen complaints lodged

at all
MARTY

I told you
JANE

Shut up Marty

UNCLE AL (reluctantly)
Theres something else

MARTY JANE
What is it What other thing

UNCLE AL
I probably shouldnt tell you- youre
both hysterical on the subject Im
starting to feel like a guy handing
out free Arthur Murray coupons to
victims of the dancing sickness

MARTY
Uncle Al if you dont tell me-

He makes strangling gestures

UNCLE AL (reluctant)
I went out to that rest area

MARTY (triumph)
You found the tracer
UNCLE AL
No but I found some blood smeared on
a tree trunk in that grove

MARTY
There You see

UNCLE AL
It could have been anything Marty

MARTY
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his
car and trying to run me down You dont
think that was a dream do you

UNCLE AL
No

INT THE CONSTABLES OFFICE WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL

HALLER is behind his desk rocked back in his chair hands
laced together behind his head Hes looking at UNCLE AL
Theres a silence that draws out for quite some time In it
UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable

HALLER
Thats just about the craziest damn story
Ive ever heard Al

UNCLE AL
I know I could have edited out all of the
completely crazy stuff but I thought you
deserved to hear it with the bark on

HALLER
I appreciate that Now the next question
Do you believe any of this You do dont you

UNCLE AL
Lets just say I believe Lester Lowe should
be checked out

HALLER rises

HALLER
That can be arranged

They shake hands

EXT THE RECTORY NIGHT

A Chevrolet with TARKERS MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the
side in gold leaf pulls up JOE HALLER gets out and as he
does theres a business of pulling his pants legs down over
his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots not black cops
shoes We want the audience to notice these boots remember
them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the
picture He goes up the walk

HALLER rings the doorbell

No one comes HALLER rings the bell again Waits No one
comes He leans down and looks through a side window

INT THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM HALLERS POV

No one there

EXT HALLER

He goes down the steps stands on the path for a moment and
then goes over to the shed-garage He opens the door and
looks in

EXTINT THE GARAGE HALLERS POV

LOWES coupe is in there Theres just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans

INT THE GARAGE WITH HALLER

He goes around to the front of LOWES coupe and squats down
In the bg a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda
cans

HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo He
lights it and looks at

INT THE COUPE CU

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken Theres a scratch in
the paint and a dent in the bumper HALLERS fingers come
into the frame and touch the scratch They stop and THE
CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint As MARTY
has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair so does
LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car

INT HALLER
His eyes widen

SOUND SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about
nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum
scrap heap behind HALLER He is a mixture of man and
werewolf and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE In
one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLERS peacemaker

HALLER starts to turn LOWE strikes him with the bat CAMERA
CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls rises and
falls We cant see HALLER and that is probably a mercy
but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and
again and again

EXT THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS WITH MARTY AL JANE
DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today
The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees
MARTY
Mr Haller said hed check him out and
guess what No one sees him again

UNCLE AL
And what do you suggest I do about it
dear boy

MARTY slips off his St Christophers medallion and hands it
to UNCLE AL

MARTY
I want you to turn this into a silver
bullet

UNCLE AL

Youre not going to let it go are you

MARTY
I saw what I saw

UNCLE AL
Marty the moon wasnt even full

JANE (quietly)
In the made-up stories the guy whos the
werewolf only changes when the moon is full
But maybe hes really that way almost all
the time only as the moon gets fuller

MARTY (finishes)
the guy gets wolfier

JANE (hands AL her crucifix)
Here Take mine too

MARTY
Jane you dont have to do that

JANE
Dont tell me what I have to do and what I
dont booger-brains

MARTY
Will you marry me Jane

UNCLE AL
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy

Lowe became a werewolf to begin with

JANE
I dont know Maybe he doesnt know either

MARTY
No one knows how cancer begins either- or
exactly what it is- but people still
believe in it

UNCLE AL
The kid is eleven years old and already
he sounds like a Jesuit A French Jesuit

MARTY
I think hes going to come for me Not
just because I know who he is but
because I hurt him Only I dont think
hell try again as Lowe

UNCLE AL
Dear boy you have gone right out of

your mind

MARTY
Will you do it

UNCLE AL only looks at him confused and unsure

EXT A COUNTRY ROAD WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON DAY
UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the
wagon for a moment and then we are looking up the short
lane and into a gravel pit

THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN FAST on the sandy rear wall We can
see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand Its
bloody and chewed

EXT THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY DAY

The wagon pulls in

INT THE CAR WITH MARTY JANE AND UNCLE AL

MARTY
Please Uncle Al

JANE
Will you

The St Cristophers medal and the crucifix are hanging from
the rearview on a fine silver chain UNCLE AL takes down the
medal and looks at it

UNCLE AL
All right I give up Yes

MARTY JANE
All right Thanks Thank you Uncle Al

UNCLE AL
If either of you ever tells anyone I even
bought a piece of this story werewolves
will be the least of your problems

EXTINT SILVER BULLET MONTAGE

a) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MACS GUNS AND AMMO He takes out the St
Cristophers medal looks at it and shakes his head as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity He goes inside

JANE (voice-over)
Uncle Als friend Mac was more than a
gunsmith he was Uncle Al said an
old-world craftsman a sort of wizard
of weapons

b) In the gun shop interior we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure In the bg window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o-lanterns our first clue that All
Hallows Eve is nearing UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly
using his hands a lot we dont know exactly what the tale
is but it must be a whopper In the course of it he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them

JANE (v-o continues)
God knows what sort of story my uncle
told him but I think that for men who
have been married as often as Uncle Al
invention on short notice becomes
something of a specialty

c) In his workroom we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain

JANE (v-o continues)
The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
silver content of my crucifix and Martys
medallion
d) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANES contribution and MARTYS
melt together they are becoming on and indissoluble

JANE (v-o continues)
-melted them down

e) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold

JANE (v-o concludes)
and molded them into a silver bullet

INT MACS GUN SHOP WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL DAY

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box He
puts it down on the glass counter top

MAC
Here it is

INT THE BOX CU

MACS hands open it disclosing a single bullet resting on
dark velvet plush It is a 22 short round and it gleams a
pure silver It would be great to hype this bullet
optically- not much just a little- to make it look
absolutely magical Almost holy

INT MAC AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently holds it to
the light

MAC

Nicest piece of work I ever did I think
ts got a low-grain load so it wont
tumble Should be pretty accurate

UNCLE AL
ts just a gag thats all What would
you shoot a silver 22 bullet at anyway

MAC (joking)
How about a werewolf (Pause) Happy
Halloween Al
EXT THE FULL MOON CLOSE NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen swimming mysteriously in the
warm summer air

JANE (voice-over)
By the time Martys silver bullet was done
it was Halloween and the full moon had
come around again Earlier that afternoon
my grandfather who had been dying of cancer
for over seven years finally finished the job

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house Theres a carved
jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door

obviously been crying

NAN

The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again

NAN

treaters even if they come

UNCLE AL

The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out
again

NAN
You kids go to bed on time Youve got

UNCLE AL

NAN

The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side
yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of
the house (this is the opposite side from MARTYS bedroom)

There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-
its like an animals run The WEREWOLF creeps along this

MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs
where the stair chair awaits JANE is waiting for him at the
living-room doorway MARTY sees the gun on the floor and
stops

MARTY
If thatd gone off it would have been the
end of our silver bullet

INT UNCLE AL

He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism He bends down
and picks up the pistol He opens the cylinder Five
chambers are empty in one theres a bright silver circle
INT UNCLE AL

He pushes the cylinder plunger dropping the silver bullet
into his hand

UNCLE AL
See dear boy Totally unimpaired

Behind him the WEREWOLFS head appears in the window its
green eye flaring
INT BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY WITH MARTY AND JANE

MARTY looking toward UNCLE AL sees nothing JANE is
looking toward the window and she SCREAMS

JANE (shrieking)
Its him Its the werewolf I see him

INT UNCLE AL

He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL
has the 22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the
silver bullet loosely held in the other

Nothing in the window but darkness UNCLE AL turns back to
the kids

UNCLE AL (sharply)
You see it Marty
INT MARTY

MARTY (shakes his head)

INT UNCLE AL

His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare
is over his relief is tempered with irritation Theyre
just a couple of hysterical kids after all and JANE is
actually worse than MARTY Polly Practical indeed

creep over me

not just the window it was looking through before but the
whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way
through roaring

UNCLE AL whirls raising the pistol automatically to fire-
but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are
empty He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF
smashes him aside

INT UNCLE AL A NEW ANGLE

He goes flying backward The pistol goes one way the silver
bullet another

Its roaring furious its one eye flaring

aside The glaring savage expression on its face says that
now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside
