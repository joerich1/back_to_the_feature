Note
Our story alternates between Past and Present
Present means the fall of 1858 when Darwin was 49 The
children are Etty George Betty Franky Lenny and Horace Past means the summer of 1850 when Darwin was 41 The

children are Willy Annie Etty George Betty Franky (2y) and baby Lenny

INT DARK ROOM THE PAST DAY

In darkness chemicals wash over a copper plate Strange
silvery patterns evolve in the half-light

EXT TERRA DEL FUEGO DAY

Our POV rotates downwards onto an irregular shape

This shape is grey-green and crammed with detail which
emerges as we draw close - like a continent seen from outer

space

A fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a
patch of lichen

A number of other fruit flies are grazing there

Wider The lichen is on a rock A black lizard climbs over
the horizon - stalking flies

A slow advance A sudden rush A fly is snapped up and
mashed between toothless gums

The lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential
victim when

A shadow falls the lizard tries to flee A seabird grabs
the lizard in its claws Death is sudden and bloody

The bird settles to eat

WhizzThunk A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and
impales the bird through its wing

The wounded bird falls between boulders flapping
helplessly

The rest of the flock take to their air calling and
wheeling as

A crowd of local savages come racing over the larger
horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows
spears rocks and throwing-sticks

A child grabs the injured bird and kills it
An adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird

The rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting
each other shouting and snarling among the whirling flock
of birds

AND WE CUT TO

EXT COASTLINE DAY

A POV shot through a telescope The whirling birds the
strange half-animal forms of the savages

The whole scene is jerky out of focus and inaudible at
this great distance like a very old silent movie

CHARLES DARWIN (VO)
In Terra del Fuego The land of
fire - A blighted and loveless
country on the earths furthest
rim - there lives a community of
the dirtiest the rudest the
least civilised beings you can
imagine

The telescope focusses The image becomes a little clearer
EXT CLIFF TOP DAY
The flock of boobies fly out to sea

The savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs where
they stop in sudden amazement staring at a distant sailing
ship

DARWIN (VO)
They were all completely naked
the men as well as the women
with hair down to their bottoms
They spoke in grunts and they
never washed their hands and
faces In many respects they
resembled wild animals except
that animals are kinder to their
children

A savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head
again

Strange foreign cries of the sailors are faintly audible
over the water as the anchor is dropped with a rattle and
a splash A small boat is lowered

DARWIN
One day Captain Fitzroy went
ashore to meet them

The slow rhythm of the oars
Sailors and savages clutch their weapons watching each
other in breathless anticipation

INT DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO THE PAST DAY
A door opens and a figure in black hurries past clutching

a number of prepared photographic plates in their light
proof cases

TECHNICIAN
Not long now I shall be with you
immediately

ANNIE DARWIN wearing in a checkered dress aged about 9
years old sits looking straight at camera

She has short hair and a pretty oval face
On her lap there is a posy of artificial flowers

background an improbable vista of jagged mountain

PHOTOGRAPHER (0S)
Ready now Very still please

ANNIE
Will this hurt papa

DARWIN
No It is only a beam of light

ANNIE
How can light make a picture

DARWIN
Well they prepare a copper plate
with chemicals on it The
chemicals are sort of energized
by the light reflecting off your
face
Then silver sticks onto the plate
according to where the light is
brightest

ANNIE
Betty was worried it would hurt
What a little duck she is

DARWIN
So as I was saying Captain
Fitzroy went ashore to interview
the Fuegans

EXT SHORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO DAY

Waves lap on the black pebbly beach

in the

where a young naval

captain FITZROY with mutton chop sideboards disembarks
lightly from his jolly-boat

The

DARWIN (VO)
After some discussion persuaded
three of the savages children to
come home with him

for slaves

discussion is more in the nature of heated bargaining
Fitzroy finally produces enough cloth and axe-heads to
secure the deal

The unwilling children pushed away by their parents and
grabbed by sailors who bundle them biting crying and
kicking into the waiting boat

DARWIN (VO)
Their names were Jemmy Buttons
York Minster and Fuegia Basket

INT BELOW DECKS DAY

Below decks a slapstick struggle with soap and scrubbing
brushes - much biting kicking and howling - as sailors
scrub the children clean

SAILORS
Ow Shite Hold still ye maggot

DARWIN
The captain had them washed and
got their hair cut then dressed
them in proper clothes and
taught them proper table manners

INT CAPTAINS CABIN DAY

The children cleaned and dressed seem happy enough in
their new situation

They sit at the captains table clumsily sawing with a
knife and chasing Brussel sprouts around a plate with their

cutlery

A sprout shoots off the table

EXT SHIPS DECK DAY
Splosh A weighted canvas body bag is tipped overboard

The rough unshaven seamen crew all remove their hats some
of them cry openly

DARWIN
York Minster died of the smallpox
but the other two learned English

and went to meet the queen

EXT BUCKINGHAM PALACE DAY 10

A fanfare as the gates swing open as a coach-and-four
rattles through

INT BUCKINGHAM PALACE DAY 11

Jemmy Buttons looking very smart in velvet suit with
silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the Royal hand

Fuegia Basket curtsies

Queen Victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand
out presents off a purple silk cushion A Bible for Fuegia
and a telescope for Jemmy

EXT SHORE OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO DAY 12
Hairy savages reassemble on the cliff tops

DARWIN
Two years later Captain Fitzroy
and I took them back in the
company of a young Parson hoping
they would bring the other
savages to god and to teach the
others by example

The hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea
Another boat the Beagle has anchored in their bay
Captain Fitzroy is being rowed ashore with Darwin plus a
very young parson and the two young Fuegans who are happy
and agitated to see their homeland again
DARWIN
And what do you think happened

INT DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO THE PAST DAY 13

Annie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her
mouth from twitching the corners

DARWIN
(Laughing)

Correct A complete and total
failure

EXT ROCKY CREVICES TERRA DEL FUEGO DAY 14

At the first sight of their countrymen Jemmy and Fuegia
rip off their clothes drop the bible and the telescope
and run to join them yelling like nut-cases

HAIRY SAVAGES
YAAAAAH

JEMMY FUEGIA
Yaah Yahh

The benighted young parson scrambles after them collecting
their discarded garments from among the rain-swept rocks

PARSON
Jemmy Fuegia

The telescope is smashed The Bible lies abandoned - the

wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the
storm

INT DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO DAY 15
Darwin still laughing dabs his eyes
ANNIE
(Laughing)
Yaaah
The photographer disappears behind black curtains
TECHNICIAN
Very still now No more talking

please

Annie composes her face in an expression of angelic
seriousness

A glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue

Close on Darwin watching his daughter his eyes still damp
with tears of laughter

Electricity hums The strange blue light glows brighter
brighter Brighter
The image of his daughter imprints on Darwins memory Just
so Forever

16 INT DOWN HOUSE DINING ROOM THE PRESENT EVENING 16
Servants are laying a table for dinner

Gas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the
lofty room

Mrs Davies the Welsh cook bangs the dinner gong and shouts
across the darkening garden outside

MR DAVIES (0S)
Children Franky Horace Dinner

Darwins attractive wife Emma adjusts the lamps and the boys
run in Franky aged 10 Lenny aged 8 Horace aged 6

LENNY
Mama mama

EMMA
Yes What is it

LENNY
Horace says hes six feet tall

EMMA
Have you all washed your hands

HORACE
He said I have to be or I cant
join the army

EMMA
First things first An officer
must always tuck his shirt in

Their elder sisters Betty and Etty take their places at
table

BETTY
The boys made a camp with a camp-
fire
LENNY

Oh Sneak
EMMA
Wheres the campfire

BETTY
In the summer house but Brodie
put it out

Parslow enters with the turreen

EMMA
Thank-you Parslow Where is Mr
Darwin

PARSLOW

He was killing pigeons Maam

EMMA
Will everybody sit down please

As they are pulling in their chairs Darwin enters drying
his hands on his trousers

Hes aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his
former air of gaiety

He sits with a distracted nod to the family

PARSLOW
Soup du jour sir

The children smile at Parslows air of earnest formality
but the atmosphere even among the younger kids is sombre
and subdued

DARWIN
Thank you Parslow

He butters some bread and starts eating Emma clears her
throat

DARWIN
Oh

The children bow their heads The bread stick in darwins
mouth Emma says grace

EMMA
Lord God who watches over all
that we do Bless this family and
the food we eat In Jesus name
Amen

Everyone repeats the Amen except Darwin

EMMA
I hear Mr Hooker is coming
tomorrow

The children prick up their ears at this They like Hooker

DARWIN
He wont stay long

EMMA
Did he say what it was about

DARWIN
I think this is not the time to
discuss it

EMMA
Maybe the time to discuss it was
before you invited him

DARWIN
He sent a telegram Im sorry if
it inconveniences you

Emma purses her lips and turns her attention back to the

children

EMMA
Eat your soup now

Darwin takes a couple of spoonfuls pauses as a wave of
nausea sweeps over him then pushes away the dish

DARWIN
(To Parslow)
Tell Mr Davies it was delicious
but my stomach is not quite right
yet
(To Emma)
Excuse me

He gets up and leaves As soon as he has gone
natural talkativeness reasserts itself

CHILDREN

the children

Can we take Mr Hooker to the
Chalk pits Why cant he stay
Can we pick blackberries

EMMA
I think he is just here to work

EXT DOWN HOUSE DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT NIGHT

A branch taps gently against the window pain like an
insistent guest demanding to be admitted

The coal fire burns low in the grate - wind in the chimney
rattling the damper

Firelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass
case on a bird skeleton on a fossil and on numerous
specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles
preserved in spirit-of-wine

Darwin sits immobile in his chair regarding a locked
black lacquered steel trunk on the floor under his work
table

A voice speaks behind him

ANNIE
Arent you going to open it

He turns and sees her sitting on the day bed - the same
little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio

Shes the same age as she was then and wearing the same
checkered dress - though Darwin himself has aged ten years

DARWIN
Maybe best if I just burn the
whole lot

ANNIE
(horrified)
No papa - You cant Im in it

DARWIN
Dont be absurd Of course youre
not

ANNIE
The story of me when I was small
You showed me the pages

DARWIN
Ah yes

ANNIE
The natural History of babies
Remember

DARWIN
Of course I remember

He continues to stare at the shiny black box his hand
fluttering lightly - a nervous tic

Music seeps in - a soothing Chopin Nocturne and

INT DOWN HOUSE DRAWING ROOM THE PAST NIGHT 18

Darwin aged 40 - bright-eyed and inquisitive leans over to
examine something offering it his finger tip while making
little tut tut tut noises

In the cot is a one-month old baby

DARWIN
Annie Annie Annie

The piano music continuing over as her fist closes round
the end of his finger then tries to pull it towards her
mouth

He pulls it away from her and she frowns

He offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game
Baby Annie laughs

Darwin writes something in his notebook Then tucks his
pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial

expressions - scowling smiling - to gauge the babys

response

Emma turns on the piano-stool

EMMA
(affectionately)

What are you doing

DARWIN
Just playing

She comes over and leaning against him reads from his
notebook

EMMA
Six weeks Gurgles Holds tight
to my finger Tries to suck
Smiles at my smile

The baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure

DARWIN
I should add that she is musical

EMMA
I hope you do not plan to treat
all our children as little
animacules to be included in your
experiments

DARWIN
Do you mean there will be more

EMMA
I assumed thats what you wanted
Of course if the idea doesnt
appeal then

DARWIN
Appeal Dearest cousin I am
making plans for an army

He takes Emma in his arms She gives a little squeak -
caught off balance then laughing as he waltzes her around
the room singing

EXT WOODS AND MEADOW THE PAST DAY
An army of children - the Darwin family - run across the
screen from left to right The little kids first

scampering through the hay meadow off into the trees

Household servants follow carrying blankets hampers and
parasols

The red haired Scottish nursemaid Brodie shouts ahead to
the little ones

BRODIE
Careful Not too far ahead now

The children ignore her so she pick up her skirts and races
after them

The Adults follow in their wake - Charles and Emma Darwin
plus two younger men aged about 30 - Joe Hooker and the Rev
Innes

EXT RIVER BANK THE PAST DAY

They have set up their picnic on a river bank

Emma is reading

Joseph Hooker is teaching the boys to fish He has
spectacles and long wispy side-whiskers a battered panama

on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees

HOOKER
Give it time to take a bite

The fishing float moves a little
HOOKER

Hes Nibbling Nibbling Oh

Bother No-one move
Hes dropped his spectacles in the shallows
George (aged 5) feels a jerk on the line He squeals and
drops the rod The fish takes off upriver Will goes after
the dropped rod

On shore Annie runs up with a collecting box to show her
father

ANNIE
Ive got one

She opens the box to show him a little black beetle
The local parson Innes inclines his head to inspect it

ANNIE
What should I feed it

MR INNES
A leaf I should think What plant
did you find him on

ANNIE
In the mud under that log

Innes looks to Darwin for advice

MR INNES
Or a piece of bark maybe

Darwin peers at the insect

DARWIN
Cycrus caraboides You can see
from the mandibles hes a hunter
He feeds on slugs and snails

INNES
Oh

Annie runs off calling to the other children
ANNIE

Etty Willy Find me some slugs
Hes hungry

INNES
When I said I knew something of
insects

DARWIN
Oh tush I studied Theology

for a year but yet I know
exceedingly little of the bible

INNES
Then once I am properly installed
at Down I shall take pleasure in
instructing you

DARWIN
I should look forward to that
immensely

Emma knowing her husbands ambivalence towards religion
casts him a slightly arch amused look Innes notices this
though he pretends not to
Hooker returns from the river looking slightly damp with
the rod which he has managed to retrieve

HOOKER
Everyones a bit wet Sorry but
the fish are surely biting More
worms boys more worms

George is looking under stones

HOOKER
Try over there Georgey weve
used all these ones up

They move off joining Annie and the other in their hunt
for crawling things The air above them is heavy and
sparkling with pollen

21 EXT OCEAN NIGHT

A sailing ship sails past trailing phosphorescence it its
wake

DARWIN (VO)
On the Beagle quite often we
would drop a flask in the ocean
and find it teeming with living
particles which glowed in the
night

22 INT SHIPS CABIN NIGHT

The figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask
of sea water glowing in the darkness

He takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on
the illuminated stage of his microscope

Under the microscope against a black background millions
of tiny swimming animals
23 EXT BY THE RIVER BANK THE PAST DAY

Cut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering
particles - against the dark trees behind

DARWIN
SO much beauty for so little
purpose

EMMA
Surely not without purpose They
were helping to light the ships
way were they not

Darwin smiles at the idea turns to Innes
DARWIN

Are you familiar with the works
of Thomas Malthus Mr Innes

INNES

He married his first cousin
didnt he

EMMA
So did Charles So did I

INNES
Oh I was not at all
suggesting

Emma waves it away Just teasing

DARWIN
He made the point that if every
trout say has a hundred
offspring And so on and so on
through the generations Then the
planet would be knee deep in
trout in just a few decades

INNES
Of course most of the eggs are
destroyed and eaten so the
numbers remain stable That is
the beauty of Gods plan

Emma gives Darwin a So there look and hands Innes a
sandwich

EMMA
Cheese and cucumber

INNES

Thank-you

Somewhere in the woods Annie has found a treasure trove of
worms and slugs

ANNIE (0S DISTANT)
Over here there are millions

DARWIN
It doesnt strike you as an
exceedingly wasteful plan - these
myriad lives created only to be
immediately extinguished

EMMA
(a gentle warning)
Charles
INNES
(confidently)
They are providing food for
others
DARWIN
You think they are happy about
it
INNES
Happy

Close up on a writing worm Hooker is instructing George
how to put a worm on a hook

HOOKER
Through his bottom and up though
his mouth - perfect

DARWIN
To be doing Gods will

EMMA
(to Innes)
Please ignore him After two
glasses of claret he tends to
becomes mischievous

DARWIN
No Im serious If thousands are
destroyed that a few may live
their lives is not the general
sum total of happiness not in
some kind of massive deficit
INNES
Well far be it from me to
speculate on the mind of God far
less the happiness of an
earthworm ha ha ha But it seems
to me that nature is at
peaceand most of her denizens
are content

EMMA
Amen

INNES
(to Darwin)
You dont agree

DARWIN
I think it is a battlefield A
constant and shifting struggle
for survival between everything
and everything else

EMMA
I really do think men have a
problem with natural beauty They
cannot ever just accept it for
what it is

(Calls off)
Children Sandwiches
(Then)

Tell me of your wife Mr Innes

Darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from
the sun

The base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away
Looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming

white - the skull of a sheep with briars growing through
the eye sockets

24 EXT BASE OF THE HEDGEROW TIME-LAPSE NIGHT 24
The sheeps skull is half-decomposed

In fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of
flesh from the bone birds feeding on the maggots

A bird becomes trapped among the briars It flaps madly
upsetting a nest

Eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the

dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and

rats then slugs then worms

All the times tendrils and vines are growing the skull -
bleached white - now encased in a cage of thick spiny

branches fizzing with insect life where ants and ground
beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and

INT DARWINS BEDROOM THE PRESENT DAWN 25

Darwin wakes in sudden terror

Dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him - a
William Morris design of interweaving vines

Emma is asleep in her night-cap at his side

Darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness until his

hand fluttering on the coverlet becomes still at last

INT SCULLERY THE PAST DAY 26
Light and noise

Crash of gleaming copperware clattering of water in the
pipes as the servants prepare Sunday breakfast

The cook Mrs Davies looks out through a steamed up window
to see the angular figure of Charles Darwin bent almost
double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn

Brodie joins Mrs Davies at the window

MRS DAVIES
What is he doing now exactly

BRODIE
Cutting the grass with nail
scissors

MRS DAVIES

Such a shame he never had a
proper job At least your Mr
Thackeray had his books to write

INT DOWN HOUSE THE PAST DAY 27
Children thunder up and down the stairs between Brodie who
is doing a final check on grooming and Emma who is
marshalling them in the hall

INT HALLWAY THE PAST DAY

EMMA
Chop chop Georgie Socks And you
have not buttoned your trousers

Baby Lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him

INT GIRLS BEDROOM THE PAST DAY

Brodie is arranging hair and tying ribbons for Annie Etty and Betty ANNIE
Did you never think of getting
married Miss Brodie

BRODIE
Once But he went to Australia
and I missed my chance

Willy passes the door his hair in need of brushing

BRODIE
Master William Hairbrush

William comes in Brodie brushes the back of his hair

WILLY
Ow Ow

BRODIE
Well what do you expect It isa
birds nest

WILLY
Papa says God doesnt care if we
are neat

BRODIE
(brushing)
Your father is a very wize man
but has a small understanding of
religion No-one can read what
goes down in Gods great book of
accounts Fingernails

Willy presents them for checking

BRODIE
You can go

30 INT HALLWAY THE PAST DAY 30

The children come racing and swinging and clattering down
the stairs

Emma holding the baby in one arm steers a tricycle out of
the way clearing a path to the door

EMMA
Mrs Davies Will you ask Jenny to
wear a bonnet I would not like
people to think her fast

George aged 5 tugs at her skirt

WILLY
Can I bring my mouse for a
blessing

EMMA
What mouse

George pulls it out from his pocket Its dead muddy
and bloody

GEORGE
Elsie caught it in the barn We
need to pray for his soul

EMMA
Mice dont have souls Leave it
on the window sill Everyone come
now or we shall be late

31 EXT LANEWAY DOWN HOUSE THE PAST DAY 31
Pealing of church bells

Mist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the
ancient oaks

A little procession heads down the lane The Darwins -
Charles and Emma - plus their servants and children (older
now for we have flipped into the present) all in their
Sunday best

The trees are bare Their breath condenses as they walk

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE THE PRESENT DAY

The ancient flint church stands in the centre of Downe
(sic) village opposite the George and Dragon pub

A massive and venerable Yew tree casts its shade over a
number of gravestones one of them inscribed to Mary Darwin
born Sept 1842 died Oct 1842

Beyond the church fence villagers greet each other before
heading inside The great majority of the village have
turned out from Squire Lubbock through the tradesmen and
domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers (farm
labourers) in their colored smocks

Rev Innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate

EMMA
Reverend Innes

INNES
(smiling)

Maam Welcome Welcome

Then his eye moves on to Charles Darwin and his smile
falters his expression turning slightly cold

Darwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away through
the throng of parishioners leaving his family to file into
the church without him

EXT WOODLAND PRESENT DAY

Darwin walks across the meadow and into the woods

A flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare
trees overhead

INT DOVECOTE PRESENT DAY 34

In darkness a furious struggle squawking and frantically
beating wings

Darwin seizes on a dove and backs out of the dovecote the
silhouette of his upper torso taking shape in the square
hole in the floor

He climbs down the ladder passes the captive bird down to
Parslow then climbs back up and pushes him upper body into
the dovecot again in search of the next victim

EXT THE GARDEN DOWN HOUSE THE PRESENT DAY 35

The dovecote is a substantial affair on four pillars with a
ladder in the centre

Outside the dovecote the boys are racing around playing at
soldiers (Franky 10 Lenny 8 Horace 6)

Parslow has a number of the birds in cages

DARWIN
Ring the two milky pouters Well
sacrifice the tumblers and
skeletonize them Then

He looks up as a coach appears in the lane The boys
immediately break off from their game and run after it
shouting

BOYS
Its Mr Hooker Its Mr Hooker

Darwin tries to wipe the bird shit off his hands and
succeeds only in getting it on his sleeve

His breathing quickens He seems at a loss Parslow is
awaiting further instructions

PARSOLOW
Then what Sir
DARWIN
Just to the shed with them I

shall clean myself up

He hurries off
36 EXT THE FRONT GATE THE PRESENT DAY 36

The coach pulls up and Hooker alights - ten years older
than when we saw him catching fish but still with the same
hallmark side whiskers and wire-rimmed spectacles the same
springy step and ready grin

Already he is being mobbed by the younger boys - Lenny
Franky and Horace - who clearly adore him

BOYS (AD LIB)
- Were the Light Brigade Horace
is a Russian

HOOKER
Good choice Horace I shall be
Lord Raglan and watch the
slaughter from a safe distance

BOYS
- Will you give us a piggy-back
- Lenny cut his foot on a nail
There was lots of blood

Emma emerges from the front door She smiles pleased to
see Hooker despite her misgivings

Then her smile falters as another man emerges from the
coach behind him

HOOKER
Emma Forgive the short notice
You know Thomas Huxley

EMMA
Only by reputation

HUXLEY
Mrs Darwin

HOOKER
He insisted on coming and I could
not refuse him

EMMA
Tell papa his visitors are here

LENNY
He knows already

HORACE
He went that way

Emma smiles brightly covering for her embarrassment at her
husbands increasingly erratic behavior

EMMA
Anyway Come in please Come in

Hooker heads towards the house the boy still clustered
around him

FRANKY
Sir Is it true when you were in
the Himalayas you were imprisoned
by the king of Sikkim

HOOKER
Absolutely true

LENNY
And he thought you were a spy for
stealing his rhododendrons

HOOKER
Thats approximately true

FRANKY
and he wouldnt let you leave
unless you agreed to marry his
fattest daughter

HOOKER
Yes (Conspiratorial) but
you are never to tell my wife
that

EMMA

Children leave Mr Hooker alone
now Im sure he has more
important things to discuss

HOOKER
Not really but I think Mr Huxley
does

Huxley has seen Darwin washing his hands by the
skeletonizing shed

Huxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers
Emma off into the house

HOOKER
I have my heart set on a cup of
tea and one of Mrs Davies
scones

Emma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be
gently side-lined

37 INT KITCHEN THE PRESENT DAY 37

Emma is by the kitchen window rearranging tea things on a
tray

The sky outside is dark and lowering

Through the window she can see Darwin heading off down the
sand walk - head bowed walking stick in hand - deep in
conversation with Huxley

She drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor

MRS DAVIES
Ill do that maam Please Let
me do it

38 EXT DOWN HOUSE THE SAND WALK THE PRESENT DAY 38

The Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden
and the fields flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows

HUXLEY
Were reforming the Linnean The
committee will comprise myself
Lyell Huxleyyourself of
course if you are willing

Darwin grunts noncommittally The Crunch crunch of their
feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod
walking stick

HUXLEY
We intend to reclaim science as a
profession - wrest it away from

the country parsons and beetle-
collectors Your book will be our
rallying point

DARWIN
You know it is not yet any fit
state to publish

HUXLEY
I have read your detailed
abstract The argument is
complete and utterly compelling
All that is lacking is the detail
and we know you have that in
abundance Your barnacle work has
established you as the pre-
eminent authority on marine life

DARWIN
On one small mollusc

HOOKER
In which the whole story of
creation can be read Do not
pretend to me that was not your
intention

DARWIN
Honestly

HUXLEY
A family tree of barnacles
stretching back 300 million years
to the time it was a free
swimming prawn

DARWIN
There are many gaps

HOOKER
Of course with gaps But that is
the very point If we but had the
complete fossil record we could
trace all life back to one speck
of protoplasm The branching of
forms in ever more complex
successionuntil

DARWIN
Yes yes but one cannot infer too
much

HOOKER
Mr Darwin Either you are being
disingenuous or you do not fully
understand you own
accomplishment You have killed
God

DARWIN
Mr Huxley

HUXLEY
and good riddance to the
bearded malicious old bugger

DARWIN
(interrupts)
Please I must beg of you

HUXLEY

No I must beg of you sir Joseph
Hooker we know is too nice a chap
to do it You are a fine and
brilliant man who hates to give
offence - an admirable quality -
wish I had it myself But what do
we believe What do we know to be
true Will you light the way or
leave us all to flounder in the
mire for another decade

He stops and lowers himself onto a bench teeth clenched

HOOKER
Are you alright

DARWIN
A touch of indigestion It will
pass

Its clearly worse than that but Huxley refusing to be
distracted blithely ignores it and sits down beside him
til the worst of it passes

HUXLEY
It is time to write your book Mr
Darwin Write it brilliantly as
we all know you can Strike hard
and fast with a blow that is
utterly conclusive

DARWIN

(in pain)
Sir you are talking like a
revolutionary and really

HUXLEY
It is a revolution And not
before time
(MORE)

HUXLEY (contd)
Goodbye to the lot of em - damned
bishops and Archbishops with
their threats of eternal

punishment

DARWIN
And youd replace Gods Laws with
what

HUXLEY
The laws of logic The laws of
nature

DARWIN

Knowing as we do that most
capital crimes are her everyday
practises Theft rape murder
adultery infanticide

Huxley waves it away

DARWIN
We live in a society bound
together by the church An
improbable sort of barque I grant
you but at least it floats You
suggest we change all that at a
stroke You wish me to rebuild
plank by plank the very vessel
we are sailing in

EXT DOWN HOUSE DAY

The Coach to London has pulled up outside the front gate
Huxley is aboard Darwin is talking with the coachman

Hooker comes down the path in his black coat carrying his
Gladstone bag

Mr Hooker
He turns He has already said his good-byes

EMMA
I beg you please dont push him

HOOKER
No-one can push Charles You know
how fixed he is Bit of a
barnacle himself his own
words

EMMA
And if you prize him from his
rock he will die I know you all
mean well but

COACHMAN
(Impatiently)
All aboard

Hooker gets aboard Huxley leans out of a window and waves
cheerily to the whey-faced Darwin

HUXLEY
Well meet again Mr Darwin

INT THE LANEWAY DAY
The coach pulls away

Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with
the boys clustered around her skirts

HUXLEY
What did she say to you

HOOKER
That it was killing him

HUXLEY

A mighty slow death considering
the time hes spent Well be
dead and buried ourselves if he
prevaricates much longer

Huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them
embarrassed by Huxleys directness inspecting his own

conscience in the bevelled glass

INT DARWINS STUDY NIGHT

In the darkened study with his specimens and books all
around him Darwin kneels by the box

Steeling himself he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid
and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored
there

The bulk of it is a single manuscript accumulated over
many years divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes
interleaved

The Chapters are headed Variation under domestication
variation under nature Struggle for Existence Natural
Selection

A noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin

Its Annie ten years old in her checked dress as she will
always be in his imagination

ANNIE
Why are you scared

DARWIN
Like you said Youre in it

ANNIE
Its only a book silly

He sits there regarding the open box paralysed by
indecision Annie tenderly smooths his hair rearranging
his collar

DARWIN
What are you doing Annie

ANNIE
Im making you beautiful

DARWIN
I have to work

Though the soft touch of her little hands is almost too
real for him to bear and he closes his eyes

ANNIE
Breath in papa Breathe out Now
Tell me a story

DARWIN
I have no time

ANNIE
About Jenny Please

The sound of a wave breaking Wind stirs Darwins hair

He opens his eyes and he is

42 EXT ENGLISH BEACHSIDE THE PAST DAY 42

Sitting with Annie ten years ago on an English pebble
beach

She has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in
families

The dialogue is continuous

DARWIN
Why do you always ask for Jenny
Its so sad

ANNIE
Thats why I like it It makes me
cry

She looks up from her shells and smiles winningly

Darwin looks out to sea at the bright crashing line of
surf and begins the familiar much-told tale

DARWIN
Once apon a time there was a
family of Orang-u-tangs living in
the jungles of darkest Borneo

43 EXT JUNGLES OF BORNEO DAY 43

Our POV moves between dark tropical trees to find a group
of Orangutans flopping around grooming each other
As with the land of the Fuegan savages there is something
slightly artificial about these jungles as though the
trees really belong in Kew gardens and the naked jungle
warriors whom we now see stalking through them are on
loan from the museum of mankind

DARWIN
Their eldest daughter was the
most loving caring and trusting
Orang of all

We follow a young nimble female swinging through the
trees revelling in her own gymnastic ability until she
stops - hearing something the sound of human speech

DARWIN
But these qualities in themselves
cannot guarantee an apes
survival Sometimes quite the
reverse

Native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth

A warning screech from one of the Orang-u-tangs posted as
lookouts

Most of the apes flee up into the canopy Jenny stays where
she is fascinated just a moment longer than is prudent

DARWIN
When she realized her danger it
was too late

As she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of
her The hunters pounce

DARWIN
They put her in a bag and carried
her off

ANNIE
much to her loving parents
sorrow

DARWIN

Exactly

The family screech and hoot anguished as the hunters head
back off through the trees

EXT MARKET-PLACE DAY 44

Exotic coins and bank-notes pass from hand to hand from
the tribal chief to the sultan in his overlarge turban
from the sultan to the trader in his solar topee and
stained white suit

DARWIN
The hunters sold her the to the
Sultan who promptly sold her to a
visiting Englishman who packed
her aboard a sailing ship and
brought her to London zoo

Jenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal
cage

INT CARGO SHIP DAY 45

The cage is lowered by a crane Jenny looks out from her
swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses

INT CAGE LONDON ZOO DAY 46

Now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent
enclosure

She has been dressed ridiculously and poignantly ina
smock and a bonnet

A group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of
her Eventually they give up and move on

DARWIN
In London she had many admirers -
of whom your father was but one

Darwin moves forwards from the shadows where he has been
observing and taking notes

As the other humans move away be attempts to start a
conversation with Jenny in her own language much in the
way he communicated with baby Annie

DARWIN
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Jenny regards him sceptically then looks away

DARWIN
HOO

She startles and looks at him aggressively

DARWIN
Hm

He reaches in his pocket This gets her interest She comes
closer expecting food

Darwin takers out a sprig of verbena - a strongly scented
herb

He holds in front of his nose and inhales making contented
expressions of pleasure

Jenny watches
Darwin holds the verbena towards Jenny
Cautiously she extends a hand through the bars

Their fingers touch in space like God Giving life to Adam
For Darwin its a breakthrough - a moment of connection

Jenny eats the verbena and spits it out shrieking angrily
CHARLES
Wait sorry wait - Ive got
something else here for you
He reaches in his pocket She cocks her head alert

With the air of a conjurer he pulls out

A childs hand mirror flashing as it catches the sun
through the skylights

CHARLES
(pleasurable surprise)
Ahhhh

He shows Jenny her own reflection and then hands the
mirror through the bars

Jenny takes the mirror bites it discovers it is inedible
and smashes it on the ground

Charles makes a sad whining sound

CHARLES

Hew Hew Hew

JENNY
(pouting)
Hmph

Meaning OK then Im sorry

Its such a complex human reaction - grudging contrition -
that Charles laughs aloud with pleasure

Jenny laughs

Charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of
Chopin

Jenny covers her ears and chatters Not listening not
listening

Charles insulted stops playing

Jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say Play if it amuses
you Im must kidding

EXT THE BEACH THE PAST DAY

The salt wind The dazzling light The slow pulse of the
surf

Darwin has paused in his narrative

ANNIE
Go on papa

DARWIN
Go on what

ANNIE
The bit where she gets sick and
dies

DARWIN
No Why do you want to hear that
bit

ANNIE
I just like it It makes me cry

Darwin smiles his own eyes filling with tears

Then a door opens softly in the sky

48 INT THE STUDY THE PRESENT NIGHT 48

It opens wider to reveal Emmas elegant profile framed
against the gaslight of the hallway

Her POV the black box is unlocked and open its contents
strewn around the floor at darwins feet

Darwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his
had a magazine published by the Society for the useful
Distribution of Knowledge with a picture of Jenny on the
cover

EMMA
Are you coming to bed

DARWIN
Presently

He doesnt move She comes in

EMMA
What did Huxley want

DARWIN
He thinks I should write it and
be done with it He feels it isa
question of moral courage or
the lack of it

EMMA
You did not tell him about your
health

DARWIN

His theory is that I am making
myself ill by holding back That
I should lance the boil Plunge
in and hang the consequences

EMMA
Thank the Lord he is not a
surgeon
Darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself

DARWIN
Ive concluded he is right Bite
the gag Speed is everything It
will all be over in a matter of
months

Emma is horrified

EMMA
It is not mere months that
concern me Charles Nor even
years or decades

Its said quietly but with genuine anguish To Emma it is
as though her life partner has announced hes contemplating
suicide

EMMA
Do you really care so little for
your immortal soul - for the
knowledge that you and I may
never be together in all of
eternity

DARWIN

(softly)

You know that what concerns you
concerns me also What do think
has held me in limbo all these
years

Emma has They both know it She turns abruptly from the
door and hurries away

49 INT BEDROOM THE PRESENT NIGHT
Emma has been crying She lies in bed pretending to sleep

Darwin gets into bed behind her He wants desperately to
reach out a hand to touch her to comfort her but he

cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve

DARWIN
Dearest Emma You know This is
not a decision made lightly

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAWN 50
In the dawn light Darwin is writing a letter to his wife

DARWIN (VO)
It has been a very slow and
gradual process like the raising
of continents

EXT GARDEN THE PRESENT DAY 51

EMMA stands alone in the wintry garden a white apron over
her black dress reading

DARWIN (V0O)
What else can I say to you
except that it seems the process
is now complete

A tear tracks down the curve of Emmas cheek as she folds
the letter puts it in her pocket and return to the
business of dead-heading flowers

In voice over we hear singing

CONGREGATION
All things bright and beautiful
all creatures great and small
All things wize and wonderful
The lord God made them all

EXT DOWN VILLAGE CHURCH THE PAST DAY 52
Move in through the graveyard past the ancient yew
CONGREGATION (OS)
Each little flower that opens
Each little bird that sings

He made their glowing colors
He made their tiny wings

INT DOWNE VILLAGE CHURCH THE PAST DAY 53
The church is packed for the Sunday Morning service

The Darwin family stand in the front row
Emma the servants and the rest of the family are singing
lustily Parslow - a somewhat pompous operatic tenor
Brodie and Innes both loudly Scottish (Innes out of tune)
Annie by Darwins side trilling along in a tuneful little
descant

She notices her father is not singing and offers him her
hymn book with the words

Darwin smiles and returns it Its not that he doesnt know
the lyrics its just that he cant bring himself to say
them

DARWIN FAMILY
All things bright and beautiful
all creatures great and small
All things wize and wonderful the
Lord God made them all

The organ played by Mrs Innes wheezes to a pause Innes
himself mounts the pulpit

INNES
Let us pray

Everyone bows their heads in prayer

INNES (CONTD)
Lord God we know the world is
governed by Thy plan

Darwin is immediately not listening

He looks along the row of his children standing dutifully
in a line between Charles and Emma

George aged 5 is studying the woodlice which are nesting
between the pages of his hymnal

INNES (0S)
Extending even to the merest
creatures thou hast made such
that even a sparrow falls not to
the ground without thy will

Darwin stands watching the play of light from the stained
glass window on his shoes Then raises his head

INNES

Teach us that all misfortune
All sickness and death all the
trials and miseries of which we
daily complain are intended for
our good being not the vagaries
of an uncaring universe but the
corrections of a wize and
affectionate parent

Innes looks up sternly and sees the Darwins head raised
among the sea of down-turned heads

Their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge and in that
moment Darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that
religious faith has left him

With a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to
take the collection Darwin slips out from the pew and heads
off up the aisle

DARWIN
Excuse me

Hes intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking
boards under his feet loudly announce his departure

Innes raises his voice above the fusillade

INNES
Turn with me now to the book of
Job Chapter Two verse twelve

The congregation not daring to raise their heads watch
Darwins sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle
EXT THE CHURCH THE PAST DAY
The rise and fall of Inness voice continues in the
background as Darwin walks out from the porch emerging
from shadow into sunlight

A summers day He feels like a weight has been lifted

The church beadle comes out behind him

BEADLE
Are you all right sir

DARWIN

Never better Thank-you

He heads off up the gravel path

INT WOODLANDS THE PRESENT DAY 55
The faint and Distant sound of church singing filters

through the misty woods The black wet trunks of trees

catch the sunlight

Frosty dew highlights Mistletoe and holly and dead bracken
and the sudden red flash of a robin

Darwin cuts a strange dark angular figure walking along
the narrow track a single step at a time

He pauses breathing and listens
His quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm

Further on A pheasant breaks cover A hare stands upright
in a clearing then bounds away

Darwin looks down and takes another step placing his feet
carefully silently so as not to disturb the wildlife

Cut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the
same spot

INT WOODLANDS THE PAST DAY 56

Darwin is ten years younger pacing in the same measured
way through summer woodland

Theres a noise behind him and he turns finger to his lips
for silence

Annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line
of children Etty George Betty and Franky in decreasing
order of height

ANNIE
Shh

FRANKY
(to ANNIE)

What are we looking at

The question comes back up the line

DARWIN
A weasel

The children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful
sight

In a little sun-dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop
the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit
of

a young rabbit which sits utterly hypnotized by the
performance

At first its strange and amusing then the dance becomes
more sinister The weasel advancing by tiny increments as
it tumbles in the air finally

ANNIE
No

The weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck
and shakes it savagely

The rabbit shrieks and spasms

Annie is beside herself drumming the ground with her feet
in a fever of fear and pity

The rabbit is still in its dearth throes its neck broken
its back legs still jerking

ANNIE
No No Stop it Daddy Stop it
Make it stop

The rabbit is already dead

DARWIN
Annie Annie Annie

He sinks to his knees heedless of the mud on his Sunday
best worsted embracing her

The others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death but
none of them distressed as Annie They are country children
and death is an everyday event

GEORGE
The chickens do that too when
cookie kills them

ANNIE
(tearful furious)
Chickens are different
(To her father)
(MORE)

ANNIE (contd)
Why didnt you do something You
should have stopped it

DARWIN
The weasel has to eat Its the
way of the world Annie

ANNIE
Its not fair Its not fair

DARWIN
No its not fair at all

Patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside
The weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair

DARWIN
»-but still it is
extraordinary do you not think
that a weasel should learn to
dance the polka

Despite herself the concept amuses Annie Chest still
heaving with sobs - she dries her eyes and smiles at him
through her tears

INT DOWN HOUSE BEDROOMS THE PAST NIGHT

Piano music - Chopin - plays softly over as Charles and
Emma do the rounds of their large brood of children
turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads taking a doll
from one sleeping childs embrace a sword from another
Shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom

EMMA
Good-night Lenny

DARWIN

Good-night Frankie

EMMA
Good-night Betty

Darwin watches his wife a sensuous figure stooped over
the sleeping child a lock of hair falling forwards as she
kisses her

DARWIN
Good-night George

EMMA
Good-night Etty

DARWIN
Good-night Willy

DARWIN AND EMMA
Good-night Annie

Shes sound asleep Finally Charles and Emma are alone
together in the blissfully silent house

Emma smiles

EMMA
Dear Charles

DARWIN
Dearest Emma

He takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom

58 EXT THE BEACH THE PAST DAY

Emma lies on a rug her head is in Darwins lap She is
reading aloud from a new book of poems by Wordsworth

EMMA
Loving she is and tractable
though wild
And innocence hath privilege in
her
To dignify arch looks and
laughing eyes
And feats of cunning and the
pretty round
Of trespasses affected to
provoke Mock chastisement and
partnership in play

She puts the book down

DARWIN
(smiling)
Then we were wrong She is not
unique after all

Darwin is watching Annie dancing in front of the surf
turning cartwheels - a wild dancing sprite of the sea
oblivious to the cold shouting and singing

THE BEACH LATER
Later Near the cliff Darwin is geologising

Hes excited breathless and windswept shouting over the
sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge
assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his
kids who are more interested in clambering

DARWIN
This is Devonian about 400
million years ago Rocks like
this might have fishes in them
trilobites tree ferns corals
maybe

He knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer
then moves on

ETTY
Is this a bit

DARWIN
No that is Cretaceous Etty It
was made a hundred millions years
ago when this cliff was a coral
reef and Down village was a swamp
full of great crocodiles

Tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards
playing at mountaineers

DARWIN
We might find oysters and sponges
imprinted in it or dinosaurs if
we were lucky

GEORGE

Whats a dinosaur

ETTY

Professor Owen invented them

DARWIN

They are the giant lizards which
lived on earth before there were
any humans

BETTY

But they werent real

DARWIN

Of course they are Betty Did I
never tell you of the skeletons I
found in South America

(to Etty)

Do you remember Mr Martell

No

Annie arrives
wet swimsuit

ETTY

hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her

ANNIE
Yes you do When he came to tea
and showed us drawings of his
Iguanodon And George burnt his
fingers roasting chestnuts

ETTY
Oh yes

ANNIE
She doesnt remember

DARWIN
You should have your clothes on
Annie You are quite blue

ANNIE
Savages dont swear clothes

She runs to the top of a great fallen rock spreads her

arms out

and yells to the sky

ANNIE
Im a Fuegan

DARWIN
Well dont fall and hurt
yourself Your mother would never
forgive me

Annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels

DARWIN
Annie

ANNIE
Ive found one

In the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed
unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a
fossilized trilobite

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAY

The black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around
the office

Stacks of paper - a stack for every chapter - are held down
with paperweights - a fossil a skull a specimen bottle

Darwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands
then reaches for his pen
INT VILLAGE SCHOOL THE PAST DAY
Annie reaches for her pen

Reverend Innes is giving the children their writing
lessons according to Mulhausers technique

INNES
First positions

The children assume the position as if in some militaristic
drill

INNES
Second positions

Grips are adjusted pens are dipped

INNES
Assume the distance

The children lean back fractionally so their elbows are
just back from the edge of the desk

INNES
sees and begin

The Children start to copy the sentence which Innes has
written on the blackboard

Annie reads the sentence and hesitates And on the seventh
day God ended his work which he had made and he rested

INT DARWINS STUDY DAY

Darwin massages his cramped hand then takes a blank sheet
of notepaper

DARWIN
Dearest Hooker I am one week
into the great project and I feel
at last that it is real Its
title is On the Origin of
Species As I write theses words
why does it feel as though I am
confessing to a murder

A paper stirs in the breeze and he pins it with the nearest
object to hand - Annies trilobite

His eye rests on it a moment

cut TO

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PAST DAY
The corrugated gray surface greatly magnified

The Darwin of ten years ago is examining the trilobite with
a watchmakers eyeglass

There is a small mirror above his desk angled so as to
give him a view of the path leading round from the front of
the house

Innes appears briefly in it

preceded by Annie

who is

trotting to keep pace with him and crying

Darwin intent on his work

notices neither of them

From downstairs he hears the door knocker then Brodies

voice then Emmas overlapping with
Inness Scottish brogue

INNES (0S)
I thought you needed to
I had to chastised her

Darwin remains immersed
trilobite
in boxes

INNES (0S)
It is not fair to the
nor to Annie herself that
head be filled with these

half-heard fragments of

now why

examining each detail of the
comparing it with other specimens in books and

other
her
ideas

EMMA
Are you listening Annie

Annie sobs louder incoherent in her grief

Darwin finally focusses on the sounds
distress and gets up to investigate

recognizes her

EXT UPPER HALLWAY DAY 64

He reaches the top of the stairs Annie is directly below
him slumped still sobbing at the foot of the stairs

Emma has ushered Innes to the porch out of sight

INNES (0S)
I shall bid you good day then

The front door closes Darwin comes downstairs

DARWIN
What happened

ANNIE
Nothing

DARWIN

Its not nothing (To Annie) Why
are your knees bleeding

EMMA
Mr Innes had to have words with
her It is sorted now

DARWIN
Words are very well I am asking
what happened to her knees

ANNIE
Mr Innes sent me to the corner
and made me kneel on rock-salt

DARWIN
What

ANNIE
(in a rush)
I said there were dinosaurs and
he said there wasnt dinosaurs
but there were because you saw
them

EMMA
(interrupting)
Annie Let me talk to your
father He told her to kneel til
she repented

DARWIN
Repented what

EMMA
The bleeding is due to her own
stubborn-ness It is finished
now

DARWIN
It is by no means finished Where
is my coat Its intolerable

EMMA
Charles Please

Charles ignores her Forcing his arm into the sleeve of his
coat

EMMA
Mr Innes is a dear friend and
neighbor I beg you at least
appraise yourself the facts She
contradicted him repeatedly The
fault was Annies Mr Innes was
quite within his rights

DARWIN
(his arm is stuck)
In his rights to torture our
children for expressing the plain
truth

Brodie appears and Darwin ushers Annie towards her

DARWIN EMMA
Please take her to It is not the truth as he
kitchen sees it

DARWIN
Well damn how he sees it Damn
the pair of them and all their

works

EMMA
Charles listen to yourself
Listen

Blocking his path as he heads for the door Her palm flat
on his lapel soothing reasoning with him

DARWIN
Emma please I will not have
Innes tell me what I can and
cannot tell my children

EMMA
It is what I have told them every
night at bedtime It is the
instruction my aunt and your
brother and most of our family
live by It is what all of the
village believe or try to
Charles Must our children be
revolutionaries at nine years of
age Write to him with your
concerns - our concerns - about
the manner of the punishment but
please do not set yourself
against him Think of my feelings
on this I beg you
Finally his outrage has spent itself neutralized by her
gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her

DARWIN
Youre right of course Im
sorry

He embraces her
Emma is reassured she cannot see the conflict written all

over Darwins face

65 INT STUDY DAY (THE PRESENT)

The conflicted expression has hardened the furrows in
Darwins brow etched deeper as he dips his pen and begins
the second chapter

From the floor below we can hear Emma practising a piece of
music on the piano - Chopins revolutionary etude a
rippling brooding arpeggio running up and down the
keyboard redolent of an angry sea

Darwins pen scratches doggedly over the paper

66 INT BEDROOM NIGHT

In the bedroom in his nightgown Darwin scrubs the ink
stains off his fingers with a pumice stone

Emma passes behind him preparing for bed He glances at
her in the mirror

DARWIN
Youre still angry with me

EMMA
No Why
DARWIN
I can always tell by your
playing
EMMA

Not angry Im sad

67 INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAY

Darwin sits at his desk writing and editing his hand
clamped on the pen

A voice speaks from nowhere

ANNIE
Talk to her

DARWIN
(still writing)
And say what She does not want
to hear it

ANNIE
Then write to her

DARWIN
(irritably)
That is what I am doing Annie I
am writing all of it

68 EXT DARWINS STUDY DAY 68

Emma passing the open door glimpses Darwin talking angrily
to himself as he writes

DARWIN
and then she can read it and
we can all be free of this Now
please Annie no more
interruptions

69 EXT GARDEN DAWN 69
The music continues louder
A frosty coating of dew covers the lawn
Footprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden
Parslow stands outside shivering in the grey morning
light
Darwin shouts from inside

DARWIN
Pull

Parslow pulls a lever

Theres the sound of crashing water a yell of pain from
inside the tower

Ravens rise calling from the surrounding trees

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAY

Darwin dips his pen scores out some text from his previous
draft and writes again

The music continues from downstairs louder and more
insistent than before

LOUNGE ROOM THE PRESENT DAY

Emmas hands race back and forwards along the piano
keyboard

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT

Darwins pen scratches across the pages making a noise
like fingernails on a blackboard

The music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull

He speaks aloud the words he is writing in an effort to
drown out the piano music

DARWIN (THOUGHT VOICE)
In time small variations become
extreme

Strange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across
his desk seeming to change and transmute before his eyes

DARWIN (VO)
Organs change their very
function the oviduct becomes a
cement gland

He stops His hand is shaking too much to write

ANNIE
Whats an oviduct

DARWIN

Nothing that need concern you
ANNIE
(sulkily)

I know what it is anyway

Darwin gets up abruptly from his desk

INT WATER TOWER DAY 73

DARWIN
Pull

Darwin stands naked clutching to two hand rails for
support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours

its contents on top of him

Darwin yells

EXT DOVECOTE 74

Birds rush out from the dovecote

INT STUDY 75
Darwin dips his pen and writes

DARWIN
What was once a free-
swimming creature now finds
itself glued by its head to a
rock flailing for food with its
legs

The Revolutionary etude is continuous now - real or
imagined

UNDER THE SEA 76
Surf crashes

Underwater among the swirling seaweed fragile sea
creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf

INT MALVERN SPA TREATMENT ROOM DAY 77

Annie screams and kicks her legs overwhelmed by water in
some dark place

Pull back to reveal

INT HELL

A vision of hell

The water is fire

The barnacles are people

The people are Annie Emma and Darwin

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Darwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed He raises his
right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand
fluttering in the moonlight like an organ with a will all
of its own

Emma is a sleep Theres a crucifix on the wall above her
bed On the bedside table theres a bible

EMMA
About the midst of this
valley I perceived the mouth of
hell to be and it stood also
hard by the wayside Now thought
Christian what shall I do

INT NURSERY THE PRESENT NIGHT

The children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed-
time story to them by lamplight

Emma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive

faces

Shes aware of Darwin standing in the darkened corridor
beyond the door drawn to the cosy little group but unable
to join it

She lets him be Continues reading

EMMA
And ever and anon the flame and
smoke would come out in such
abundance with sparks and hideous
noises that he was forced to put
up his sword and betake himself
to another weapon called All
Prayer

INT ETTYS ROOM NIGHT

The older girls Etty and Betty finish their prayers and
jump into bed in their night-gowns

Emma comes in to take away their lamp

ETTY
Is Daddy not coming to kiss us
good-night

EMMA
He is still a little bit ill from
working maybe tomorrow

BETTY

Thats what you said last night
Emma turns out the light In the darkness Etty says

ETTY
I think when Annie died he
stopped loving us

Emma returns to her bedside

EMMA
Oh come now Etty You know
thats not true He is just a
little bit ill - and a little bit
busy

INT BOILER ROOM DAY
In the bowels of Down House the house we find Darwin
wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood-burning

stove

As he gazes into the leaping flames Annie appears at his

shoulder

ANNIE
Is there really such a place as
hell
DARWIN
No of course not How can there
be
If he is supposed to be loving
and forgiving - what on earth is
the sense punishing all these
millions of souls
ANNIE
But just suppose if there was
And all this was punishment
DARWIN
All what
No reply
DARWIN
I dont know what you mean All
what
INT THE WATER TOWER DAY 83
Darwin stands legs apart in the water tower bracing
himself like a colossus against the full force of the
deluge
DARWIN
Pull
EXT THE WATER TOWER DAY 84

The gardener splitting logs watches Darwin stagger from
the tower with a rug wrapped around him and make his way
back to the house

INT DARWINS BEDROOM DAY 85

Darwin lowers himself into bed inky and tousled He seems
prematurely aged crippled by the gruelling process of
writing the book
As he lies there unable to sleep lines of written text
seems to appear behind his closed eyes or in the tangled
vines of the wallpaper

Emma speaks from the other side of the bed

EMMA
Talk to Mr Innes Please You are
clearly not well

DARWIN
He is what A physician now

EMMA
You know what I mean I think he
can help you

Charles remains stubbornly silent his hand fluttering over

the coverlet

EMMA
I am taking the children to Maer
for a while to visit their
cousins
(Beat)
I worry for you Charles Please
talk to him

Fire flares in the grate as Darwin compares the skeletons
of various pigeons

He starts a new Chapter changes under domestication

87 INT THE DOVECOTE THE PRESENT DAY 87

Pigeons mate and coo in the dusty twilight

88 EXT THE DOVECOTE THE PRESENT DAY 88

Parslow picks up two of them casually wrings their necks
and heads off with them to the skeletonizing shed

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAY 89

Darwin Looks out of the study window searching for
inspiration

He sees Emma and the children getting into a coach with

their baggage

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT NIGHT 90
Darwin sits at his desk

He has written the chapter heading and nothing else

Parslow knocks and looks in

PARSLOW
Will you be eating sir

DARWIN
No thank you
Parslow leaves Darwin addresses the empty room
DARWIN
Annie Annie
She will not come
EXT THE BEACH THE PAST DAY 91

Annie dancing in the surf One minute she is there and the
next she has vanished lost among the churning waves

Darwin leaps top his feet shouting

DARWIN
Annie

Raucous male laughter takes us to

INT PUBLIC HOUSE THE PAST EVENING 92

The George and Dragon on a Saturday night The air loud
with laughter and thick with pipe smoke

Clodhoppers crowd the snug many of them roaring drunk
with their florid complexions stained and broken teeth

Darwin trying to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of
locals who hail him and gather around him wedging him into
a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter

THATCHER
Mr Darwin Mr Darwin I was
explaining to Mr Goodman here
your interest in breeding Mr
Darwin is our foremost scholar in
the village

DARWIN
No No I am but one of many
There is Squire Lubbock and the
reverend Innes

The Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents

THATCHER
he is also a noted explorer
the author of many books

DARWIN
which no-one has read

THATCHER
a fellow of the Royal society
and a prodigious expert on
clamsoysters

DARWIN
Barnacles

THATCHER
Mr Goodman now is the foremost
pigeon fancier in all the
southern counties Kent champion
two years running I swear he can
give you any beak or plumage in
four generations Head and tail
in five

DARWIN
How do you do it

GOOODMAN
By breeding cousin with cousin I
find it the fastest way to alter

the strain - provided you do not
weaken it in other ways

Darwin takes a slug of whiskey

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT NIGHT
He is drinking in his office

The clock strikes twelve The page in front of him remains
stubbornly blank

Darwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move

In one of the bottles on his desk a fleshy marine specimen
seems to have come to life

It writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin making a
sound like a baby crying

Darwin recoiling in horror pushes himself back from his
desk The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk

Behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the
birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches
have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass
case They flutter frenzied tapping with their beaks on
the inside of the glass which shatters as

One by one the bottled specimens explode discharging their
contents onto the floor

A lamp falls over The room is filled with birds the floor

awash with formalin and broken glass

The Study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm
and

INT DARWINS BEDROOM THE PRESENT DAWN

Darwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk the
whiskey bottle a quarter empty ink on his hands and his

shirt cuffs

He gets up and puts on his shoes

INT DOWN HOUSE DRAWING ROOM THE PRESENT DAWN

The scullery maid lighting the fire looks round and sees
Darwin

He walks past her without a word and heads out into the

garden

EXT DOWN HOUSE GARDEN THE PRESENT DAWN 96
Darwin heads across the lawn takes a key from his belt and
opens the door of the skeletonizing shed

INT SKELETONIZING SHED THE PRESENT DAWN 97

In the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the
dovecote

Some have been skinned their pelts curing on frames their
carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the
flesh from the bones

Previously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory
Now it seems a place of horror

The door opens behind him Its Parslow

DARWIN
Get rid of them

PARSLOW
Which ones sir

DARWIN
All of them All of it
INT DOVECOTE THE PRESENT DAWN 98
Darwin reaches into the dovecote and starts grabbing
pigeons at random dragging them out and flinging them into

the air

DARWIN
Go Go

EXT DOWN HOUSE THE PRESENT DAWN 99

Displaced doves beat the air

Darwin climbs down the ladder

grabs and axe and attacks

the wooden stanchions supporting the dovecote

Parslow comes running over from the skeletonizing shed

calling

PARSLOW
Sir Mr Darwin

Darwin stands back hair wild eyes crazed
covered in bird shit

PARSLOW
Please rest sir Ill have John
Lewis remove it Have some
breakfast now and rest Shall I
call the doctor

DARWIN
God know

PARSLOW
Or the water tower

DARWIN
A pox on all of them

INT ANNIES ROOM THE PAST DAY

his sleeves

The local doctor Henry Holland takes out various
concoctions from his medical bag and arranges them on the

dresser

We are in the past Annie is in bed with a fever

Emma is pregnant

Charles

DOCTOR
Calomel then twice daily

DARWIN
I will not give it to her

EMMA

DOCTOR

Mrs Darwin it is nothing but

chloride of mercury I have
prescribed it often in
children as young as two

DARWIN
Not to any of mine I hope On the
Beagle I dropped some on a
microscope slide and all my
animacules died of it

DOCTOR
Well animacules are not persons
Presumably they would die if you
dose them with Madeira wine

DARWIN
On Madeira they thrived most
excellently as did Captain
Fitzroy while it lasted

Annie enjoys the joke and gives Darwin a weak smile The
doctor regards her balefully

DOCTOR
Or if she would submit to be
bled
ANNIE
Please no
DARWIN

will write to Dr Gully again

DOCTOR
(sceptical)
The hydro-therapist

DARWIN
have always found his
treatments most effective

DOCTOR
--no matter that they defy all

sense of logic

He is packing up his bottles and his lancets

DARWIN
Logic is not everything

Emma shoots him a look Til now scientific logic has been
his guiding principle
DOCTOR
Then I shall bid you good day

DARWIN
Parslow will bring your carriage
I will be down presently

The doctor leaves the room Emma is in a terrible quandary

DARWIN
I should take her to Malvern

EMMA
I think it is better she is here

DARWIN
Gully can care for her properly
there She can be treated daily
as I was

EMMA
Charles no She is better with
us With her family Please do
not take her away from me

INT DARWINS STUDY THE PRESENT DAY 101

Parslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into
space

The page in front of him is still blank
The study is in chaos It seems as though the contents of
the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize

every corner of the room

PARSLOW
Post for you sir

He leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out
After a while Darwin seems to rouse himself

He picks up the largest envelope postmarked Malaysia and
slits it with a letter knife

The sender is a Mr Wallace Theres a covering letter and a
twenty page attachment Darwin reads and lets out a sudden
loud bellow of laughter
DARWIN
Ha

102 EXT DOWN HOUSE THE PRESENT DAY 102

Darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house rugged up
against the cold Looking frail still but oddly at peace

INNES
Ah there you are Mr Darwin

Darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky
dark-suited figure of Mr Innes

INNES
May I join you

DARWIN
By odd means

He makes some space on the bench Innes hesitates unable
to read Darwins feelings towards him The smile is
welcoming enough but there is something not altogether
balanced about it

INNES
Mrs Darwin informed me you would
be alone and perhaps a need

to counsel

He sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve
it

INNES
You dropped this What a
beautiful postage stamp

DARWIN
Yes It is from the Spice
islands

INNES

I do rather envy your wide circle
of correspondents In my youth I
always wanted to travel

DARWIN
You are still young You could be
a missionary and follow in Mr
Livingstones footsteps

INNES
Yes although I have always felt
there is quite enough evil at
home without looking for it
abroad

(Then casually)

Mrs Darwin told me of the book
you are writing

DARWIN
Not any more thank goodness

INNES
You have finished it

DARWIN
It has been finished for me My
correspondent In the spice
islands has arrived independently
at exactly the same idea

expressed in a mere twenty pages
(MORE)

DARWIN (contd)
Theres brevity for you I had so
far covered two hundred an fifty
and come to a dead end So
finally I am rid of the project

Innes is relieved to hear it

INNES
The Lord moves in mysterious
ways

DARWIN

He does indeed Mr Innes I was
reflecting only the other day on
the fact that he has endowed us
in his blessed generosity with
not one but nine hundred species
of intestinal worm each with its
own unique method of infiltrating
the blood supply and burrowing
through the mucosa

Innes shifts uncomfortably
DARWIN
And then again on the great love
he shows for butterflies by
inventing a wasp to lay eggs
inside the living flesh of
caterpillars

INNES
Well It is not for us to guess
at His reasons

DARWIN
No We can leave that for Mr
Wallace now Should I advise him
to stay overseas do you think If
he shows his face in Kent he may
be required to kneel on rock
salt

Innes rises Hes a short man acutely aware of any threats
to his dignity and hes had enough of this mockery

INNES
I once valued our friendship Mr
Darwin I had hoped it might be
possible to restore it Clearly
in your present mood that is not
going to be possible My regards
to Mrs Darwin

He starts off round the corner of the house

Darwin listens to his footsteps receding then turns his
face back to the sun When he opens his eyes sees a figure
standing in the lawn

It is Annie plain as day scowling at him angrily

DARWIN
What I am forestalled by Mr
Wallace That is the simple fact
of it What reason do you have to
be angry

She shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him
and runs off towards the meadow

Darwin instantly remorseful gets to his feet and hurries
after her
DARWIN
Annie

He reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden
intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and
fells him to his knees

He lies their gasping his vision clouding as the pages of
the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to
the wind

A view from high above spiralling downwards on the Darwin
garden as household servants emerge from various quarters
and hurry to his assistance

103 INT DARWINS BEDROOM THE PRESENT DAY 103

There are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the
bedroom ceiling Like lichen on a rock Like an archipelago
of islands

Darwin lies pale and weak looking upwards from a sea of
white blankets

The door opens and he turns his head Its Emma

EMMA
You have a visitor

DARWIN
No No I will not be bled or
lectured to

She gives him a pinched look then Hooker pushes in behind

her

HOOKER
It is me Thank God you are still
with us Word came from London
you had suffered an apoplectic
stroke

DARWIN
No Simply the great relief of
liberation Did you read the
Wallace abstract

Hooker bats the idea away
HOOKER
It is a letter You have a book

DARWIN
barely half of it

HOOKER
You have a book What is not
already on the page is most
certainly inside your head and I
intend to extract it if it kills
us both

DARWIN
You have been talking to Huxley

HOOKER

No Had I done so he would have
hastened here himself armed with
every instrument of torture known
to her majestys navy

(Then)
Charles I have read the first
Chapters It is brilliant You
must continue

DARWIN
I cannot Seriously Joseph I am
completely blocked All my old
symptoms have returned with a
vengeance The sweats the shakes
the abdominal pains The whole
endeavour was cursed from the
outset

Hooker takes darwins hand presses it to stop it from
trembling

HOOKER
Charles It was you who opened my
eyes to the wonders of science
So let me open yours You have an
illness You have had it as long
as I have known you

(MORE)

HOOKER (contd)
It is clearly made worse in times
of overwork but the nature of the
work is irrelevant This is not

visited on you by God or the
devil This is a set of physical
symptoms Go to Malvern and get
treated

DARWIN
Not Malvern

HOOKER
Why not What is there to be
scared of there He has worked
for you in the past it will work
again Then come back and finish
the book Your enemies are
already toasting their good
fortune but they shall not
prevail

DARWIN
What are you talking about I
have no enemies

HOOKER

They are legion believe me and
they are implacable We are all
of us fighting a battle against
fear and superstition but we can
win this battle We must win it
You can win it for all of us Go
to malvern then come back and
finish it

104 INT DOWN HOUSE THE PAST DAY

Upstairs Servants are packing for a journey

The vigorous Darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to
room gathering his things Hat and gloves books
spectacles papers

Emma eight months pregnant tries to keep up with him

EMMA
Charles please reconsider

CHARLES
Emma it is weeks now months She
is getting worse not better

EMMA
Then I am coming with you

DARWIN
You cannot come How can you
possibly come in your condition

EMMA
It is not so far

DARWIN
It is two days by coach and
train Who will look after the
others

EMMA
I do not care for the others I
care for Annie

Etty coming apon then unexpectedly hears this and is
instantly heartbroken

EMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too
overwrought to retract it

DARWIN
Leave us please Etty

Parslow has gathered up Annie from her room and is carrying
her downstairs pale and sickly-looking with Brodie
fussing behind

BRODIE
Make sure she is tucked in Watch
her shawl

ANNIE
I dont need to go

At the bottom of the stairs Darwin takes Annie from
Parslows arms

DARWIN
The coach is outside I will
carry her from here

EMMA
Annie

ANNIE
Mama
She clasps Emmas hand Darwin keeps heading for the door
Emma holds fast to Annies hand and follows behind

DARWIN
You will see Mamma when you are

better Say goodbye now

Parslow holds the door open The coach is at the Gate Emma
stops on the threshold unable to let go her daughters hand
and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake

here

EMMA
Wait I am coming with you

DARWIN
Please Emma

EMMA
Wait there

She hurries back inside Darwin makes a decision and heads
for the coach

EXT DOWN HOUSE DAY

INT COACH THE PRESENT

Charles feeble and debilitated levers himself into the
coach with Parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather
upholstery

Servants gather at the gate Some of them tearful not
expecting him to return

EXT STEAM TRAIN THE PRESENT DAY

A steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black
smoke striking sparks from the track with its wheels

INT CARRIAGE THE PRESENT DAY

The sickly Darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous
with Parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his
lap

Every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through
Darwins guts

The people sitting opposite - a woman a child and a man -
regard Darwin in silence Whatever he suffers from its not
good and they are worried about getting infected with it
They plunge into a tunnel The carriage fills with smoke
Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it wont
budge A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwins
leg

Darwin is too weak to lift a finger Parslow slaps the
ember and extinguishes it

EXT STATION MALVERN

The train wheezes to a halt The doors open and the train
disgorges its cargo of sick people come to Malvern for
treatment - a coughing child a woman with one side of her
face aflame with shingles - the halt the lame and the
afflicted

EXT HORSE AND CART DAY

Darwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them
through Malvern

DARWIN
Tell him not this way

PARSLOW
(loudly)
Hello there Stop Can we go by
the other route

ATTENDANT
The Worcester Road is shorter

DARWIN
by the low road

PARSLOW
He wishes to go by the other
route

ATTENDANT
(with a sigh)
As you will sir

He backs up the horses and turns the cart around

INT GULLYS CLINIC DAY

Dr Gully is the chief physician at Malvern spa His marble-
tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling
pipes and dripping water

Darwin reclines on a leather couch watching the watery
play of light on the ceiling

A door opens and Dr Gully comes in accompanied by two
assistants

Gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt
and tie His trousers are tucked into calf-length
Wellington boots

He greets Darwin cheerfully effusively

MR GULLY
Mr Darwin old friend Mr Darwin
It has been too long I fear Tut
tut tut tut tut What have we now
what have we now

He clasps Darwins hand feeling his pulse at the wrist
then commands him to open his mouth

GULLY
tongue
Darwin shows him
MR GULLY
Ugh Shirt up Let me feel your

liver

Darwin untucks his shirt Gully prods at Darwins belly
Darwin winces

DR GULLY
Pulse hectic togue furred liver
tender and enlarged
Darwins ink stained fingers speak volumes

DR GULLY
No doubt you have been exercising
your brain every hour that God
gave you

DARWIN
I was persuaded to write book

DR GULLY
Madness there are far too many of
those already Are you Sleeping

DARWIN
Poorly

DR GULLY
I suppose never taking the 50C
dilution of Chelidonium

DARWIN
(shakes his head)
I had the gardener build a water
tower It no longer has any
effect

GULLY
Of course not Your gardener is
not a hydrotherapist What on
earth possessed you

DARWIN
I feared I was dying

DR GULLY
Oh come come come We shall not
have that talk here

Half turning to his assistant who is staking notes

GULLY
A smart spinal scrub Cold douche
daily at 700 Wrapping in towels
and sweating by the lamp

Then to Darwin

DR GULLY

No red meat no reading no
mental agitation of any kind We
shall soon have you right old
friend we shall have you right

INT TREATMENT ROOMS DAY 114
Music over

Darwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of Gullys
assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah

INT DOUCHE DAY 115

Darwin stands in a shaft of light grabbing onto the hand
rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his
shoulders splintering and fracturing in the shaft of
light

INT TREATMENT ROOMS DAY 116

Two assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets til he
is immobilised like a cocoon with his legs together and
his hands by his side

They pick him up and lie him down quite rigid beside
another pod like creature similarly swaddled with a red
face and a beard

BEARDED STRANGER
Mr Darwin is it

Darwin nods unable to turn his head or make any gesture
with his hands

The stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless

BEARDED STRANGE
William Carter of Southampton I
read your Beagle account many
years ago Former naval man
myself What brings you here
Myself a Bilious fever with
blood per rectum but I have
every faith in Gully The man is
a miracle worker

117 INT TREATMENT ROOM DAY 117

Darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders under
the merciless glare of a heat lamp

Sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet

118 EXT TERRACE DAY 118

A bright sunny day Darwin looking weak but purged sits
on the terrace sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral
water and looking out over the stone houses fields and
valleys of Malvern

Gully sits with him interviewing him

GULLY
What action do you most associate
with the symptoms Eating Strong
emotion Strenuous Excercise

DARWIN
Does the exercise of memory count
as an action

GULLY
Memory of what

DARWIN
My eldest daughter You remember
her

GULLY

Of course Of course You must
accept there was nothing more we
could do

DARWIN
I know that I know

A long awkward silence neither of them wants to
recapitulate the events of Annies death

GULLY
You say you were writing about
her

DARWIN

No It is a scientific text But
I had reached a point beyond
which it was impossible to
progress She had been my
companion throughout Now it
seemed she was ahead of me in a
place I could not follow

GULLY
Of course Plainly she is in
heaven

DARWIN

That is what my wife believes It
is a great consolation to her

GULLY
But not to you

DARWIN
Emma and I have become divided
on it

GULLY
Does it affect your marital
relations

DARWIN
We have none to speak of

GULLY
(a beat)
Are you familiar with the
writings of DeQuincyThere is no
such thing known to the mind as
forgetting

DARWIN
I dont know what it means

GULLY
He suggests we have thoughts
which do not actually enter the
realm of consciousness Nervous
fibres exist after all throughout
the whole body Is it not
possible that certain primal
feelings manifest in some
physical way Eczema Boils A
fever Might some blocked passion
imitate a gall-stone Or even
manufacture one
DARWIN
Well until someone devises a
machine to read nervous impulses
or a telescope to look inside
the body I suppose we can only
guess at it

GULLY
We can Mr Darwin We can look
inside you If you find yourself
open to it there is a way of
seeing

119 EXT STREETS OF MALVERN NIGHT

Darwin wanders the cobbled streets of Malvern pausing
occasionally to consult a hand-written address

It is starting to rain as finally he arrives at the
address he is looking for A substantial terraced house

Darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front
door and rings the bell

As he waits for an answer a woman appears unseen in the
rain streaked window above observing him

Darwin rings again A moment later the woman answers the
door

DARWIN
Mrs St John

MRS ST JOHN
Mr Darwin Come in

120 INT MRS ST JOHN HOUSE NIGHT

The room is large and hot crowded with pot plants and
bric- a-brac Various fringed lamp-shades a dancing Shiva
a framed picture of Lourdes and some illustrations from
the Tarot None of this inspires Darwin with confidence

ST JOHN
Just leave your coat on the
table Sit down here Show me
your palm
The husky voice and the plunging decollete troubles Darwin
who hesitates

DARWIN
Sorry Im confused What is it
you do exactly

MRS ST JOHN
I envision whats inside your
belly dear Thats what you
wanted isnt it

DARWIN
Envision how When Gully
described you I fancied some
scientific instrument

MRS ST JOHN
Depends what you class an
instrument In more resistant

cases I might use a pendulum

He frowns She smiles

MRS ST JOHN
Its ten shillings for a reading
by the way In advance

DARWIN
Well I have a ten shilling note
here in my wallet

He doesnt take it out

DARWIN
If you can tell me the numbers on
it we can begin

Mr St John face hardens

MRS ST JOHN
(coldly)
Im a professional lady Mr
Darwin I dont do party tricks

DARWIN
I am a professional man And I
asking for no more than I ask of
all my colleagues - a

demonstration of competence

MRS ST JOHN
It is you who are here to be
tested Sir not me

DARWIN
Then I am sorry to have wasted
your time

He puts his jacket back on and heads for the door

INT HALLWAY NIGHT 121

Mrs St John follows him As he reaches for the doorhandle
and opens it she says

MRS ST JOHN
Shes with you you know that

Darwin turns

MRS ST JOHN
Your little girl I saw her from
the window standing at the top of
the steps

DARWIN
How dare you

MRS ST JOHN

Pardon

DARWIN
prey on peoples grief like
this

MRS ST JOHN
I have done no such thing

DARWIN
(furious)
Do you take me for an idiot
Clearly Gully has appraised you
of my history

MRS ST JOHN
I beg to inform you he did no
such thing

DARWIN
It is chicanery of the very
lowest order and I despise it
utterly

MRS ST JOHN
Get out

EXT THE HOUSE DAY

Darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him Darwin
continues to rant at the closed door standing in the
pouring rain without his umbrella

He gets to the top of the steps and looks around trying
to get his bearings

In a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a
figure stands watching him

Darwin squints at her through the rain which is falling
harder now

The figure is Annie

She looks at him crossly then heads off up a cobbled side-
street

Darwin follows

EXT MALVERN SIDE STREETS VARIOUS NIGHT

Darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes

DARWIN
Annie Annie

The rain is getting heavier turning the gutters into
rivers

Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the
cobbles making them slick and treacherous

Darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys the sound of
rushing water echoing all around the little girl always

ahead of him

A DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him head
down cursing the weather

A childs ball goes floating downhill in the current

Darwin loses Annie then he sees her again at the top of a
steep flight of stone steps

Darwin drenched chases after her

EXT WORCESTER ROAD NIGHT

At the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks
around

There is no sign of Annie but he knows this street - The
Worcester Road - a row of Grey Georgian houses their backs
against the hill their sloping front gardens looking out

over the rooftops of Malvern

Most of the street is in darkness but the house directly
opposite has lights in the window

He knows this house also

He hesitates then crosses the street towards it

EXT GUEST HOUSE NIGHT

Soaked to the skin he raps with the brass door-knocker
then waits for someone to answer

Muffled voices Then a man answers from within

LANDLORD (0S)

Hello
DARWIN
Is Mrs Carey still the landlady
here
LANDLORD
No

The door opens on a chain

DARWIN
My daughter Annie lodged here
some years ago Can I come in

The man closes the door to release the chain then opens it
again to admit Darwin

DARWIN
I know this is an intrusion I
wonder - could I visit the room
she stayed in

The landlord doesnt know what to make of this

LANDLORD
Wait here Ill get the missus

He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and
consults with his wife in the lighted parlour

Darwin looks around This place is all too familiar to him -
the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror the carved mock-Tudor coat-
stand

Muffled conversation off

There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas
Lavender potpourri in a brass dish A wheel-chair in one
corner a picture of the pieta above the door

Finally the land-lady emerges from her parlour

LANDLADY
Which room

DARWIN
Fourteen I would only be there
ten minutes I am happy to pay

She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key

LANDLADY
Up one flight and along the
corridor to the right

DARWIN
I remember

LANDLADY
Try not to touch anything

INT GUESTHOUSE THE PRESENT NIGHT

Darwin climbs the stairs to the Landing

The younger Darwin races along the corridor

INT GUESTHOUSE THE PRESENT NIGHT

The older Darwin hesitates chest pounding outside the
door of number 14 then unlocks it as

INT GUESTHOUSE THE PAST DAY

The younger Darwin bursts into room 14 and takes in the
scene

The room is full if light A maid is bundling soiled
sheets Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully

They turn as he enters

Annie lies on the bed between them her breathing fast and
shallow She manages a weak smile

DARWIN

Is she any better Does she want
for anything

Gully stands up from the bed His expression tells us hope
is fading Annies pale sunken cheeks and caked lips

confirm it

Darwin kneels by her bedside clasps her little hand is his

own

DARWIN
Darling Annie I am here now

Annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes
his lapel making him beautiful

Brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears

INT ROOM 14 THE PAST NIGHT 132

Annie sleeps

Darwin sits up writing to Emma crying as he writes
DARWIN (VO)

Dearest Emma I think it best for

you to know how every hour

passes Its a relief for me to

tell you Whilst writing to you I

can cry tranquilly
INT ROOM 14 THE PAST DAY 133

A local surgeon lays out various instruments including a
glass syringe with a long needle

Annie struggles and whimpers Brodie comforts her

DARWIN (VO)
Mr Coates the Surgeon came today
to draw off Annies water This
did not hurt her but she
struggled with surprising
strength against being uncovered

BRODIE

INT THE CHURCH AT MALVERN DAY 135

The relatives of the sick stand or sit among the pews
arriving praying departing

Darwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar clasps his
hands together and prays

DARWIN
Save her I will believe
whatever Forever Please save
her

He looks up at the image of Christ on the cross hoping
against all reason for some sense of epiphany

Its not working He feels nothing embarrassment at the
cheapness of the gesture

INT GUEST HOUSE ROOM 14 THE PAST NIGHT 136

Darwin sits alone with Annie who is babbling incoherently
He cant make out anything she says

DARWIN (VO)
Our dear child has taken a turn
for the worse She talked a great
deal but we could seldom make out
anything Much of what she says
we cannot make out from the
roughness of her poor mouth

INT GUEST HOUSE ROOM 14 NIGHT 137

Dr Gully leaves the surgeon arrives The maids squeeze
between the two medical men bundling sheets

Brodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the
tail of her shirt then roll her on her back again with a
pillow between her two bony knees

DARWIN
Is that good my lovely
ANNIE
(suddenly lucid)
Beautifully good I am making
custards

DARWIN (VO)
Gully thinks her in imminent
danger

worst

139 INT ANNIES ROOM GUEST HOUSE DAY 139
It is midnight Darwin exhausted keeps a lonely Vigil by
Annies bedside Each breath seems like it will be her

last

Suddenly she speaks faintly but audibly

ANNIE
The rabbit
DARWIN
What
ANNIE

The rabbit taught him the polka

DARWIN
I dont understand my love

ANNIE
Tell me about Jenny

Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly

DARWIN
What about her

ANNIE
When she died

DARWIN
I dont want to talk about death
my love

ANNIE

But tell me I like it

DARWIN
Well What the keeper told me
was When she was very sick with
pneumonia lying very still he
tried to feed her but she shook
her head looking at him as
though to say Its nice of you
but really you shouldnt bother
And as he bent down to take the
spoon away she brought her arms
around his neck and kissed him
And then she was dead

Annie smiles puts her hands around her fathers neck and
dies

140 INT TRAIN THE PAST DAY

Darwin sits his face wet with tears reading through

I was in the garden looking at
our poor darlings little flower
bed when John Griffiths drove up
with your letter

141 INT DARWINS BEDROOM NIGHT 141

EMMA (VO)
When I went to bed I felt as if
it had all happened long ago
When the blow comes it wipes out
all that preceded it

INT DARWINS BEDROOM DAY 142

right before long

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE THE PRESENT DAY 143
Darwin sits in the train Heading home from malvern

He is looking across the carriage at his younger self re-
reading the letter and weeping uncontrollably

EXT DOWN HOUSE LOUNGE THE PRESENT NIGHT 144
Torrential rain crashes down on the house the garden the
ancient trees and the outbuildings flooding the path and

the lane beyond the gate

Darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside

INT DOWN HOUSE LOUNGE ROOM 145
Emma is playing a beautiful slow Nocturne
The rain outside drown out all other side

She doesnt notice the figure of Darwin until he appears
like a ghost reflected in the polished wood of the piano

She turns with a start and sees him still in his dripping
coat hair plastered over his brow

DARWIN

Sorry I startled you

EMMA
Take your coat off by the fire
there What time is it
Darwin stays where he is dripping on the carpet

DARWIN
We need to talk I need to talk
to you

EMMA

Of course but dry your hair I
shall call for a towel

As she moves to the bell-pull he grabs her wrist

DARWIN
I went back to Worcester Road I
saw Annie

EMMA
Charles No

DARWIN
Let me tell you

EMMA
I dont want to hear it This
must stop

DARWIN
You dont understand

EMMA
I do Do you think me deaf and
blind You have lived with her
and spoken with her every day
since she died

Parslow comes in with firewood then sees Emma yelling at
darwin and hurriedly retreats spilling logs in the
hallway

EMMA
She is more real to you than I
am Shes dead Charles

DARWIN
I know that

EMMA
Then what is wrong with you that
even our poor daughter cannot be
left in her grave but you
would

DARWIN
I know she is dead I know it It
is you who will not accept the
fact preferring to think of her
in heaven

This again The unspoken argument which has been brewing
for a decade never before expressed so bluntly Emma heads
for the door

EMMA
Get away from me

She heads into the hallway he follows her ranting

DARWIN
Snowy white wings and dancing
with the angels Is that your
idea of honesty

Servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot

EMMA

Why did you come back I will not
hear this

Emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs Darwin
pursues her

On the landing Betty and Horace wide eyed and terrified
are bundled into the nursery by Brodie as Charles thunders
up the stair

DARWIN
You have to Emma everything
these was between us is gone
The boat is wrecked and sunk now
We have to hold to something
else

EMMA

To what Your ghosts Your
theories What Charles

CHARLES
To the truth of what we know it

She slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it
DARWIN
Open this door Emma The truth
how wonderful and extraordinary
our daughter was

EMMA
(through the door)
I know that I do not need you to

say it Of course I know

Charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through
it Emma screams

CHARLES
But free of the fantasy free of
the rest the silly vain hope
that we will be reunited in
heaven and the nagging unspoken
belief that I killed her

In the lower hallway all the servants hear this
In the nursery Brodie aghast covers the childrens ears
In the bedroom Emma has nowhere left to run

EMMA
I have never said that

CHARLES
Say it now Say it And all the
rest that follows That I should
have kept Annie warm that day on
the beach I should not have
taken her to Malvern I should
have let you come

Tears spring to her eyes and to his The fury has gone from
both of them leaving sadness and pity

EMMA
I should have insisted

CHARLES
No It was me I took her from
you It was my fault

EMMA
I could have followed I was her
mother what was I thinking of
He moves to her
his damp coat

I did

her again

her

CHARLES
We thought she would live You
were not to know

she startles then lets him enfold her in

EMMA

I did know I knew when
you left that I would never see

I hated you for taking

CHARLES
I hated myself
of them could save her

(MORE)

I knew that none

CHARLES (contd)

All I could do was watch
hopelessly and weep for her -

then flee

the place in terror

not even waiting to see our poor
dear daughter buried She was our
treasure and I failed her We

both did

We should never have

married each other

EMMA

What are you saying

CHARLES

The unspeakable I am saying
that you and I in making our
perfect child endowed her with
the very weakness which killed

her Emma

That is what I

couldnt write That is what
forestalled me all these years

It wasnt
it wasnt
God I was

you I was angry with
Innes and it wasnt
angry with my theory

It was the truth I was angry
with It is the truth

Weeping she shakes her head in furious denial He kisses

her hair

her eyes

her tear-streaked cheeks

and dangerous idea

INT SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLES DAY 151

Darwin is in the south American jungle trying to coax down
from the trees some small squeaking creature - a tousled
looking abandoned chick

DARWIN
Here here Come on come on then

The creature draws closer eyes like gimlets in the dark
foliage

DARWIN
I wont hurt you

He reaches into the dark recesses of the forest Darwin
grabs it and stuffs it squawking into his collecting bag

INT DARWINS STUDY NIGHT

Darwin comes in empties the bag into a black box with
perforations and closes the lid

DARWIN
He knew his wife wouldnt care
for this creature so when he came
home he locked it in a box where
it couldnt run around and do any
damage

INT DARWINS STUDY DAY

Darwin works at his desk Theres a plaintive cooing sound

coming from the box next to his feet

DARWIN
But every so often hed open the
lid and feed it just because he
couldnt bear to let it die

Finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit

It has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest It takes
the biscuit and peeps gratefully

INT DOWN HOUSE DAY

Darwin goes to the box and opens it Theres nothing there
but an empty nest and some broken eggshells

discovered it wasnt in there at
all It had escaped with all its
babies who were nesting all over
the house making a terrible mess

INT DOWN HOUSE DAY VARIOUS

birds nesting in the sewing basket the bread bin and the
dress-up box

and bundled them in a blanket and
he asked his wife to dispose of
them as she saw fit

them free

in his hands

they will respond No doubt many
will wish al diabolo altogether
But least it is out in the world
now and no longer torturing me

John Griffiths the postman comes up the hill from the
village

Darwin gives him the manuscript The Postman puts it in his
satchel and heads on up the lane

Darwin turns back and walks up towards the house

As he does so a little figure Annie takes his hand and
together they continue on home Annie skipping happily by
