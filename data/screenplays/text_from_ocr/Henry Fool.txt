SHOOTING DRAFT

EXT JUNK YARD -- DAY

A garbage truck roars by and

Simon Grim hangs from the back of it He is a shy

skinny

and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old

The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off
it to

go punch out at the time clock

EXT BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

Moments later

He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his
beer

He begins to relax This is his quality private time

Then he hears something and looks up

He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen
appliances

and sees

Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and
having

sex

Simon looks on intrigued as Warren smokes then
WARREN
(to Amy)

You want some

Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up
The

coast

chase

stands

different

Simon is fascinated He drinks and looks on as

Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe
boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girls skirt
Simon cant believe this He looks around to see if the
is clear then returns just in time to see

Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her

The pipe falls from the young girls hand

Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into

Simons mouth falls open in awe
But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees
The amazed garbage man caught
Amy starts screaming insanely
Simon runs for his life
Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they
him away
INT THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
Moments later
Simon runs up and throws open the screen door He
there in the doorway catching his breath
His sister Fay is at the kitchen table watching a
portable TV while their mother Mary sits a few feet
in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a
channel

the evening
MARY
I dont know why you cooked I dont

Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs She glares

brother

FAY
Sit down and eat Simon

Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a
of some sort of gruel He hesitates then lifts his
Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in

gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over
bowl and eats some more

Pushing the bowl away gently he reaches out for the

of milk on the table and drinks straight from it

He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over
table The container drops to the floor and thick globs
cheese roll out

He stands back against the fridge holding his stomach
while

Fay and Mary look on in disgust

Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his
He stares at the ground before him as he holds his

and spits sickened

He looks up though and sees

A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven --
there in the street watching him

Simon tries to smile at her

But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head
He falls forward hurt as the little girl runs away
his hand he sees hes bleeding Desperate lonely and

he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse

Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-
dress and stands on the lawn applying lipstick

FAY
God I wanna get fucked

Fay snaps shut her compact straightens her skirt and
FAY
You OK
Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes He
back at his sister
Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off

FAY
See ya later

Simon watches her go but is still drawn to something
seems to hear up the street in the other direction He

his head sits perfectly still and listens
a

Finally

with a

He hears it now We do too Footsteps Big ones Like

giant somewhere in the distance The neighborhood

Titles begin

Simon tries to figure out where its coming from the
the house the highway at the end of his block

he focuses on

The blacktop right before him smeared with his own

Music starts

He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the
pavement He stretches out his hand and places it flat

the road The pounding is louder now becoming the beat
the music over the scene

Simon lowers his face to the pavement closes his eyes

Puts his ear right down against the road He hears

The steady tread of somebody very much larger than

Kneeling forward with his ear to the ground Simon
his eyes and sees

A man approaching The music swells up full

Simon lifts his head slowly from the road looking off
wonder at

This stranger coming towards him an oddly handsome
striding over the crest of the distant intersection
windswept mane two over-stuffed suitcases anda

tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked
the

neighborhood

walks off

to

carrying

the jaw

the

chair

unusually

Simon rises till hes kneeling up straight in the road
Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops

Titles finish

Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at
house

Satisfied but wary Henry Fool looks around the

and then down at Simon

HENRY
Get up off your knees

He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and
towards his new home
EXT BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door
his basement apartment He approaches Simon follows
the suitcases
INT HENRYS APARTMENT -- DAY
Moments later
The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in
by a decade of dank airless gloom He coughs
Entering he finds a few old wooden chairs littering
main room He inspects the old wood stove then takes a
and smashes it He tosses the wood in the stove
Simon looks on amazed Henry lights a fire with
quick results then stands back and looks at Simon
HENRY

AMY
Say something

WARREN

WARREN
She dont -- you know -- talk

Amy looks back at Gnoc snarls then follows the

gaze to the door

Simon enters Clutching Henrys cash he stops dead in
tracks when he sees

Warren and Amy

He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler

Warren and Amy hover around just out of reach like a
of vampires

Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler Simon crosses to

counter Warren and Amy hang back silent and

Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at
Amy staring a hole into the side of Simons skull
Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the

Warren shoves himself between it and Simon

Simon freezes Warren is expressionless Simon looks
Amy She turns away reaches up under her skirt jerks
her panties then leans forward on to the counter
back over her shoulder she hisses

AMY
Kiss my ass

Simon is nonplussed
Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets
A red light flashing above the stockroom door
Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to
bare behind Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees
has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass
But then Simon throws up all over her
Warren falls back in disgust
Gnoc covers her face with her hands
Amy looks around at herself realizes and starts
bloody murder
Simon falls back on to the floor clutching his
Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear
around her ankles
Then Gnocs father Mr Deng appears at the stockroom
holding a shovel and ready to fight
WARREN
(scared)
Oh shit

Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from
store Simon crawls out of the way as the old man

throws
open the door to the parking lot and screams at the
retreating
delinquents
MR DENG
(in Vietnamese)
Stay the hell out of my store you
good-for-nothing punks
Having scared them off he comes back in and starts
screaming
at Simon
MR DENG
Look at this Whats going on here
Simon get up off the floor Is this
beer paid for
INT HENRYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Later
Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink
then
watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases It is
filled
with dozens of old worn notebooks Henry stacks them
on the
mantelpiece over the fireplace the fire is now
crackling
and bright
Simon steps over and looks at
The name tag on the other suitcase Henry Fool
HENRY
(off-screen)
Centuries ago it had an e at the
end
Simon looks over and sees
Henrys silhouette against the fire He steps forward
into
the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the
floor

He hands one to Simon
his

Henry

demoniacally

lifts

shirt

his

Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising
eyes to Henry

SIMON
Where do you come from

HENRY
Nowhere in particular

He winks at Simon then struts around the room hugely
impressed with himself

HENRY
I go where I will and I do what I
must
(stops drinks)
Thats why Im in trouble Im sortve
what you might call in exileâ€™

SIMON
Why are you in trouble

HENRY
(stopping)
An honest man is always in trouble
Simon Remember that
Simon comes away from the fire watching him carefully

stands in a dim corner across the room

SIMON
How do you know my name

Henry pauses looks aside drinks then grins
He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon He
his finger and points to

Simons name stitched upon the breast of his work

Realizing this Simon moves off and thinks
Henry throws more wood on the fire glancing back over
shoulder laughing mischievously

SIMON
(stopping him)
winds up

dissolves

from
shoves

tablet to

I am not retarded

HENRY
(pauses)
Well Ill take your word for that
SIMON
(explaining)
People I mean They think You know

Because
He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but
gesticulating curiously with his hands This finally
into a dumb stare into empty space

HENRY
I see

Simon looks at him Henry stands and grabs a notebook
off the mantelpiece He tears out a few pages and
them in his pocket He hands the now fresh writing
Simon

HENRY
Here Take this And

He searches his pockets and finds a pencil

HENRY
this Keep them with you at all
times You ever feel like you got
something to say and you cant get
it out stop and write it down OK

Simon hesitates then accepts the gifts Henry goes for
another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of
notebooks on the mantelpiece

SIMON
What are these

HENRY
(proudly returning)
This This is my lifes work My
memoirs My Confession

SIMON
(carefully)
What have you done

Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire

HENRY

(wistfully)
Ive been bad Repeatedly

(shrugs and steps

away)
But why brag The details of my
exploits are only a pretext for a
far more expansive consideration of
general truths

(contemplating the

notebooks)
What is this Its a philosophy A
poetics A politics if you will A
literature of protest A novel of
ideas A pornographic magazine of
truly comic-book proportions It is
in the end whatever the hell I want
it to be And when Im through with
it its gunna blow a hole this wide
straight through the worlds own
idea of itself

He smokes Simon is impressed They hear a bottle smash

outside in the street and Henry goes to the window
Theyre

throwing bottles at the house

HENRY
(throwing down his
cigarette)
Come on lets go break their arms

Simon jumps up

SIMON
No

Henry stops Simon looks away and sits back down
SIMON
(pauses)
If Im quiet

He is ashamed of himself

Henry sees this and settles down He considers his new
friend
He

close

with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette

lights up

by Simon

Henry stares into the flames and falls silent
riveted He leans forward

thinks then grabs another chair and sits

They sit there in silence a while then

HENRY

Once I forget where I was Central
America maybe Somewhere hot Stupid
job Bad pay Dangerous location and
water so foul the natives wouldnt
even piss in it This crowd of drunken
motherfuckers hired by the local
drug cartel shows up at my hotel
room and threatens to tear me limb
from limb And I say listen hombres
OK youve got me outnumbered four
to one and youre gunna kill me here
tonight and not a soul in this dimly
lit world is ever gunna notice Im
gone Fine But one of you one of
you one of you is gunna have his
eye torn out Period Silence I
repeat myself One of you poor
underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye
ripped out of its socket I promise
Its a small thing perhaps all
things considered But I will succeed
Because its the only thing I have
left to do in this world So why
dont you just take a good look at
one another one last time and think
it over for a few minutes more

(smokes waits)
They sober up a little look at their
shoes in confusion then step out
into the hall to talk among
themselves

SIMON
What happened

HENRY
(winking)
Well here I am still after all

from his sisters room He stands outside her door and
listens

Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her
sitting on the edge of her bed smoking He approaches

room)
Shes got some ex-con in there she

SIMON
Did you take your pills

Now she says nothing She smokes and looks away

Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication

She swallows the pills and washes them back with water

SIMON
You want me to tell her to be quiet

Moments later

Simon comes downstairs into the quiet dark kitchen and
at the table He listens to the traffic on the highway
stares off into space Finally he takes the notebook
gave him from his pocket and places it before him But
he just gazes off into the dim living-room and

head Returning his attention to the notebook he digs
into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil
He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the

Lifting the pencil he pauses and stares at the blank

fq

Then after more intense hesitation he brings the
dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and
writing in a slow laborious hand

INT THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

The next morning

Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of
and some jelly donuts Simon jumps up from where he

Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection
soiled classics He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare
tries to read Its an obvious struggle He puts it
and lifts up Wordsworth studying its cover and the

of the pages A page flutters away and he climbs down
edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it Its now wet
torn so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries
it back into the book

He reads a little furrowing his brow then drinks He
his lip and tries again

He sits back exhausted and thinks He hears a twig
looks back over his shoulder to see

Amy throws a bottle at his head

Smash He falls to the ground blood streaming down
neck

Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt lifting
of the puddle and smacking him in the head

Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper
she sets aflame with her lighter

Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to

Simon turns with effort to face them adjusts his

and continues

SIMON
One of you I promise

Warren watches him blankly then is burned by the torch

Amy giggles then stops excited but confused
Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into
hands and stares straight at Warren
SIMON

You can set me on fire But one of

Warren is transfixed He shivers and looks at Amy who
back scared and puts down the gas can She turns and

like a toilet
Henry nods agreeing then lifts Simon off the floor
Mr
Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend
out

into the parking lot

Meanwhile Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor
and
places them beside Simons notebook where it still

sits
open on the table She looks at it then reads She
lifts it
off the table and reads further immediately and deeply
engrossed

Violated somehow she gets up and snatches it out of

his

hands She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry
plays

one note on the piano

to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her

notebook
from his pocket
HENRY
What the hell were you trying to do

Simon just looks at him not certain what he means
SIMON
Nothing
HENRY
Well you know you wrote it ina
kind of iambic pentameter
SIMON
Iambic what
HENRY
Verse
He scratches his chin and smokes
HENRY
Look in my opinion this is pretty
powerful stuff Though your spelling
is Neanderthal and your reasoning a
little naive your instincts are
profound But the whole thing needs
to be given a more cohesive shape
It can be expanded Followed through
Unified
(smokes then)
You see what Im getting at
Simon just stares at him overwhelmed Henry drops the
notebook on the floor and points at it with his
cigarette

HENRY
Are you willing to commit yourself
to this To really work on it To
give it its due In the face of
adversity and discouragement To
rise to the challenge you yourself
have set

Simon just blinks looks away and wonders

finally and sees
Henry sitting across from him gripping a beer and

proceeds
carefully
SIMON
A man was here today looking for

HENRY
(alert)
What man
SIMON

I dont know He drove by the house
a few times

Henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair
Jumping
around

over

to his feet he paces maniacally

HENRY
Why do they torment me like this
Why Theyre like a bunch of fucking
mosquitoes

A customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves

SIMON
What do they want from you

HENRY
They want to suffocate me Simon
They wanna extinguish me like a flame

Some kid named Tim sitting at another table turns
and asks

TIM
But why

HENRY
Theyre afraid thats why Theyre
afraid of what I might do What I
might say Think Theyre afraid of
my ideas

He drinks then returns and sits beside Simon

HENRY
You and I are alike in this way
Simon

SIMON
Yeah

HENRY

Were outsiders We think and feel
too much and too deeply And the
world cant handle that Our mere
existence is a threat to its illusion
of security Sure theyll name a
wing of a new library after us when
were dead But now Now when
were alive Now they wanna burn
us at the stake

He drinks burps then slams down the can He glances

at Tim who is still looking on
HENRY
Scram

Tim hesitates but then obeys He gets up and leaves

Henry
returns to Simon
HENRY
For example I made love to your
mother about half an hour ago and
now Im beginning to think that maybe
it wasnt such a good idea
Simon blinks Henry adds
HENRY
I mean to say I think Fay may be
jealous
Simon is deeply confused He looks ill He stands and
takes
a few steps away staring at the floor
SIMON
I dont want to think about this
HENRY
Bad move Simon
Simon stops and looks at him
HENRY
(pointing at him)
A poet has got to be able to think
about anything
Simon pauses then comes closer to Henry and stops
SIMON
Am I really a poet
Henry jumps up strides around the store and speaks at
the

top of his voice

HENRY
Of course you are A great poet But
you need experience You need to do
something to be ashamed of every
once in a while for cryin out loud
He walks to the door
HENRY
Come on Lets go out Theres a den
of iniquity right across the street
You got any money

He strides out of the store

Simon stands there stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the

old

man wipes off the table with a wet rag

distaste

and sits beside the distraught priest

HENRY
Whats wrong

The priest sighs hopelessly

FATHER HAWKES
I doubt

Henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his
cigarettes

HENRY
So youre an honest man Why beat
yourself up about it

He offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts

FATHER HAWKES
I dont know if there are grounds
for faith Is my vocation relevant
Does it make a difference

SIMON
A difference in what

FATHER HAWKES
The world The way it is Is this a
way to help relieve suffering

HENRY
Your vocation makes a difference

FATHER HAWKES
How can you be so sure

HENRY
Because vocation is the difference
Only someone who really cares doubts
Listen father as I was about to
tell my friend Simon here I am
without doubt the biggest sinner
within a hundred miles of this parish
But still Ive gotta stay up late
at night to outdo the unending parade
of mundane little atrocities I see
committed every day right out in the
open spaces of this loud and sunlit
culture we call home

FATHER HAWKES
You seem to me to be a sensitive and
generous man

HENRY
I like to think so But the fact is
I appreciate depravity Nevertheless
I insist your vocation makes a
difference because to hold out
anything other than a spiritual
yardstick to reality is to be jerking
off grandly into the abyss Listen
have you got any money Lets go
have a drink

out his notebook and pencil meaning to take notes but
instead

Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer

He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back
his book But he cant help himself and glances back

do I reduce you to only one
possibility These are not even
questions anymore I know the answers

Im creating my rÃ©sumÃ© This
computers got a program especially
for it I bought some special
stationery too Its scented Look

She shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he
backs
away in disgust

FAY
Its roses

Simon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the
fridge

SIMON
Can you type my poem into that thing

FAY
(shocked)
Thats your poem

SIMON
Yeah

FAY
(smokes then)
Simon Moms right about you A poems
supposed to be a small delicate
kinda thing Kinda feminine Gentle
Look at this Youve made a fuckin
telephone book

He places the notebooks on the table and leaves the
house

Fay clears the computer screen pulls the notebooks
closer

and gets down to work

INT HENRYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Moments later

Simon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting
in

front of the fire staring into the flames brooding
darkly

HENRY
I was caught Yes I was caught
once I was caught in flagranti
delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old
girl named Susan She was an ugly
and mean-spirited kid but she knew
how to play upon my weaknesses which
I admit are deep and many

He drinks then looks at Simon and adds

HENRY
You appear shocked

SIMON
(he is)
Sorry

Henry stands and leans over the fire

HENRY
It was a pathetic little conspiracy
A transparently desperate attempt to
discredit me and my ideas to label
me a mere pedophile As if Id be
ashamed of such a thing As if
Socrates himself hadnt been taken
out of circulation for corrupting
the youth of Athens

He comes over and takes a beer He strides around the
room
thinking reflecting
HENRY
Seven years Seven years for one
afternoon of blissful transgression
But what of it Who cares Prisons
not so bad particularly if ones a
sex offender free from the popular
and conventional horror of sodomy

Stops drinks declares

HENRY
They were not lost years

He approaches the notebooks lined up on the

mantelpiece
HENRY
I put them to good use I began my
major work My opus
He glances over at Simon who sits gripping his beer
watching rapt
HENRY
Believe me Simon this incident
with the girl prison It pales to
insignificance in the wider context
of my career
He pauses and swills back some beer He brightens up
gets

excited

HENRY

Nothing in comparison to the day my
Confession is unleashed

(beginning to pace)
What an orgy well have then huh
What shouts of outrage from the
offended populace from the
sanctimonious purveyors of culture
and quality the righteous defenders
of what ever inane and haphazard
notion of progress then in vogue
Theyll be beside themselves with
fiercely reasoned critical analysis
Apoplectic with indignation

Drinks sloppily burps wipes his mouth with his arm

HENRY
Their feelings will be hurt
He smashes the bottle in the fireplace

HENRY
Yes like a mirror which reflects
only the inside of the person before
it my Confession will lovingly
render humanitys common monstrosity
in all of its lurid wide screen glory

He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap

HENRY
Why should I blush or feel shame
before the common lot of humanity
anyway for a few banal and again I
admit inelegant transgressions

He drinks sighs and sits back down
HENRY
After all really Im doing

civilization a favor

Simon sits back in awe He waits a moment and thinks

Finally

he stands and approaches the Confession He reaches
out

and drags his hand across the notebooks

SIMON
When can I read it

Henry sits staring into the flames again He pauses

then

HENRY
Soon

INT CHURCH -- DAY
Next day
Simon and Father Hawkes are deep in conversation

FATHER HAWKES
We are told not to judge But to
forgive Not to look into our
neighbors eye to find the bad but
to find the good
(pacing)
Now this is difficult I admit
says

Simons

tear-

like

Donuts

it

(pause)
But having a good friend is not always
easy

Simon listens and carefully considers all the priest

SIMON
Yes but do you think Henry is
dangerous

Father Hawkes pauses then comes closer and sits

FATHER HAWKES
He needs help Our help Yours
especially

SIMON
But what can I do

FATHER HAWKES
The best parts of himself come to
the surface when hes helping someone
learn Ive seen this Let yourself
be taught Show your appreciation
for his guidance In this way you
know perhaps Well Theres hope
for everyone Even Even Henry
INT WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
Fay comes walking up through the parking lot with
notebooks and a pile of typed papers Shes a wreck
stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand
a weapon She throws open the door to the World of
and looks around
The place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like
was a cafÃ© or student union
Fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter
FAY
Gnoc gimme a value pack of Kleenex

will ya

Gnoc gets the Kleenex while Fay overhears two kids near
Simons poem

TIM
The violence of the imagery reminds
me of early Clash while the lyricism
of the verse recalls for me Walt
Whitman

BIBI
I would have said Dickinson maybe
even Eliot and so on But I agree
with the punk roots

Fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back
of

the store where she finds Simon with Henry who is
holding

forth to his friend and the small coterie of high
school

students surrounding them

HENRY

The greats all say the same thing
little And what little there is to
be said is immense Or in other
words follow your own genius to
where it leads without regard for
the apparent needs of the world at
large which in fact has no needs
as such but rather moments of
exhaustion in which it is incapable
of prejudice

(drinks)
We can only hope to collide with
these moments of unselfconsciousness
This divine fatigue this

FAY
(sitting)
Push over

Henry takes the typed manuscript from her and
continues

HENRY
As I tried to make plain in Paris
Nous savons que nous avons chutÃ©
parce que nous savons qui nous
sommes We know we have fallen
because we know who we are

FAY
(skeptically)
When were you in Paris

HENRY

(interrupted)
Thats beside the point But did
they listen to me Of course not

Fay blows her nose and Simon is concerned

SIMON
You alright Fay

FAY
(lighting a cigarette)
No Im not alright Your poem brought
my period on a week and half early
So just shut up Everybody just shut

up

She drops her head to the table and cries Henry and
Simon
look on in silence Then Henry continues

HENRY
For is this not the best of all
possible worlds Are not the evils
of this world necessary components
of a cosmos that could not exist
without them

Amys girlfriend Chris leans forward studiously and
asks

CHRIS
So do you believe in God

HENRY
(smokes shrugs)
Unfortunately

FAY
(lifting her head)
Yeah but when were you in Paris

HENRY
(aggravated)
At One Time

CHRIS
Simon can I have your autograph
Simon looks from her to Henry Henry winks at him

HENRY
Go ahead But never let yourself be
flattered

Simon signs the girls book

FAY
(to Henry)
So what about this friend of yours
Hot Shot The publisher

HENRY

FAY

journals first That kinda thing
You know Substantiate it

AMY
(looking up)
Whats scatalogical mean

Henry sips his beer and looks at her

HENRY
Filth child A preoccupation with
excrement Why

AMY
Thats what the Board of Education
called Simons poem yesterday
scatological

Henry reaches across the table and shakes Simons hand
INT THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

The next day

Fay is frying something on the stove a cigarette hangs
her lip A middle-aged woman with a press ID on her
appears at the kitchen door and taps

EDNA
Hello

FAY
Yeah Im listening

EDNA
My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write
the human interest column for the
Queens County Examiner and I was
just wondering if I could have a
word with Simon Grim
Intrigued Fay steps over to the door with her spatula

She
looks Edna over studies her ID then steps away and
screams
upstairs
FAY
Simon
EDNA
(startled)
Thank you

Fay comes back over near the door waving her spatula

FAY
You cant talk to him for you know
too long or anything cause hes
gotta you know he writes all
day Thats all he does Can you
believe that

No response
FAY
(calling again)

Hey Simon Get down here

Simon finally shuffles into the kitchen

FAY
Simon this is Edna Shes from the
newspaper

EDNA

(rapid fire)
Simon the Parents Association at
the local high school are calling
your poem pornography The teachers
are defending the students right to
exercise their critical tastes and
sensibilities The county agrees
with the Church and considers the
poem emblematic of modern societys
moral disintegration How do you
feel about these controversial
reactions to your poem

Simon says nothing He just stares at her

FAY
(punching him)
Simon answer the woman

Simon just looks away thinks then wanders back
upstairs

Mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes
up

to Fay and Edna at the door

MARY
I need my prescription filled

FAY
Mom this is Edna Edna Mom

EDNA
Mrs Grim what was Simon like as a
child

MARY
We all thought he was retarded

FAY
Everyone did

MARY
Never said a word

FAY
He masturbated constantly

MARY
Had no friends

FAY
Till he met Henry

MARY
And thats when all the trouble really
started

INT HENRYS APARTMENT -- DAY

Henry is shaving Simon sits in the kitchen sorting
through
rejection letters

SIMON
(reading)
Dear Mr Grim we here at the magazine
consider ourselves and the publication
open-minded and cutting edge and
have consistently printed the work
of the most brilliant and farseeing
young talent of the day Every week

we are forced to return writing which
we can not for one reason or another
publish and include a brief but polite
refusal But this tract youve sent

us demands a response as violent as
the effect your words have had upon
us Drop dead Keep your day job
Sincerely The Editors

HENRY
De gustibus non disputandum est

SIMON
(thinking)
You cant argue with taste

HENRY
About taste You cant argue about
taste God Simon

Simon gives up and pushes the letters away beaten

SIMON
The other twenty-five are almost as
bad I dont know why I bother

Henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall

HENRY
What do you mean you dont know why
you bother You bother because you
know the poem is excellent

SIMON
Do I

HENRY
Of course you do

SIMON
Im not so sure sometimes

HENRY

Can you sit there look me straight

in the eye and tell me you dont
think this poem is great That it is
not at once a work of great lyrical
beauty and ethical depth That it is
not a genuine highly individual

and profound meditation on the miracle
of existence
Simon holds the stare overwhelmed

SIMON
I ah

HENRY
Can you

Simon looks away thinks a moment then looks back at

Henry
SIMON
No I cant
HENRY
So you see you have no choice
He goes back into the bathroom Simon thinks a while
then
SIMON
(calling)
Can you recommend it to your friend
the publisher
No response
SIMON
Henry Can you recommend the poem to
him
Still no response Simon gets up and stands in the
bathroom

doorway Henry is shaving

SIMON
I mean I think its finished and
for better or worse it is book
length

HENRY
That might not be as easy as it seems

SIMON
Why

HENRY
Well its been a long time My name
might not carry as much weight as it
once did with Angus
SIMON
But hes your friend right

HENRY
We were close at one time

SIMON
You said he respected your opinion

Henry puts down his razor and looks at Simon in the
mirror

HENRY
Look Simon opinions come and go

He sees Simon looks worried

HENRY
To be honest my ideas my writing
they havent always been received
well or even calmly Theyre
upsetting Im a controversial man

He walks around the bathroom gesticulating

HENRY

You see what Im doing is too
radical Too uncompromising Itll
take time for people to see its value
Its ahead of its time perhaps or
maybe just

(stops)
A recommendation from me might do
you as much harm as it does good

Simon patiently absorbs all this then walks through

the
kitchen and looks across at the Confession notebooks

SIMON
Henry why cant I read the
Confession

HENRY
Because certain work needs to be
experienced all at once in order for
one to appreciate the full force of
its character

INT WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
Simon talks with Fay as she eats her lunch

FAY

SIMON

Hes afraid that his reputation will
prevent people from giving my work
an honest chance

SIMON
As a writer

FAY
Gimme a break

SIMON
Hes kinda like in exile Marginalized
on account of his ideas

FAY
If hes such a great big fat genius

SIMON
He has Hes written a book Its

and sits in silence for a moment

She hesitates then takes them down and holds them in

hands as if to begin reading But then she puts them

She walks over to the piano and stands there

before slowly sitting down and opening it She lifts
hands to play then pauses and looks around behind her
sure no one is there

But finally she turns back and begins playing

She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with

accomplishment At one time she was probably quite

She plays for a while gradually letting herself become
by the music But then she stops pauses and looks

behind

Simon is standing in the kitchen He has been deeply
affected
by her playing

She stares him down a moment longer then looks away

Yes It does
She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs She slams
her
bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch He
thinks
Then he gets up and goes into the kitchen

LAURA
Im sorry to disturb you gentlemen

wound-up young garbage man out here

unestablished quarters of the American
scene

ANGUS

BARRY

He grabs the envelope and sees no title
ANGUS

INT WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

Henry paces back and forth With the fingers of one

hand

pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight
in

concentration he dictates to Amy who is sitting at a
table

with her laptop computer typing his every word

HENRY
In the infinite amplitude of his
love God wants to create the largest
number of best elements that can
exist together in one cosmos OK

Amy types away fascinated by Henrys intelligence

HENRY
In an instantaneous calculation made
in eternity God computes the best
possible world and creates it Fine
This decision by God is uncontingent
and eternal rather than temporally
or ontologically sequential

Stops zeroing in on his point

AMY
How do you spell that

HENRY
What
AMY
Ontologically
HENRY
O-N-T Dont you have some kinda

spell-check on that thing

AMY
Never mind

HENRY
It is impossible for every perfect
good to be compatible with every
bated

back

leans

at

voice

back

other perfect good The intense beauty
of the mountain must be set off by

the fertility of the plain so to
speak

He smokes drinks paces some more Amy waits with
breath devastated by his obscure profundity He comes
and sits beside her reaching his conclusion

HENRY
The good of freewill must entail
real choices for sin

She gazes at his profile in love

Henry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently She
over close and whispers in his ear He turns and looks
her alarmed

HENRY
Listen Amy back off Im on parole

AMY
You feel the same way I can tell I
can see it when you look at me

Henry jumps up and looks around paranoid He keeps his
down and points at her

HENRY
Hey I dont look at you

AMY
Yes you do In the street In the
parking lot yesterday That night on
the highway

HENRY
I look at a lot of people that way

Disappointed Amy turns away and sulks

AMY
You think Im stupid

Henry sees shes genuinely upset and feels bad He sits
down and lays his hand on hers

HENRY
No as a matter of fact I think
youre a real bright kid and I like
that about you

AMY

(looks up pouts)
You do

Now Henry tries to scare her away He leers at her

HENRY
I like it so much Ive got half a
mind to do perverse things to you
Right here Right now Things you
might just learn to like

She just stares at him blinks then looks away and

tries to

imagine this She takes her laptop and leaves confused
and

blushing

Henry watches her go and grins satisfied with himself

INT PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY

Angus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at Simon
as

they walk down the hall

ANGUS

This is really quite unbelievably
bad my friend I mean Im all for
experimentation and Ive made a career
out of a healthy disregard for
convention but Look this is
profoundly irrelevant material This
is only my opinion But its an
opinion I value highly Goodnight
Laura Call Norton Press Were still
on for tomorrow

Simon looks pale as Angus strides towards the elevator

ANGUS
Ive been wrong before as a publisher
But I refuse to admit Ive ever been
wrong as a reader You have talent
I admit You have an innate sense of
the musicality of language A good
ear maybe But you do nothing
significant with it And this twisted
reasoning that poses as conviction
or insight its well its
embarrassing

They reach the elevator and stop Simon tries to catch

his
breath
ANGUS
Why did you bring this thing to me
anyway
SIMON
(weakly)
A friend of mine spoke of you He
said you had a lot of integrity
ANGUS
Yes well of course I do But Im
not crazy am I Who is this person
Do I know him
Simon hesitates almost decides against it but then
SIMON
Henry Fool
Angus looks back at him
Simon waits
Angus looks aside thinks then shakes his head
ANGUS
Never heard of him
Simon just looks at him blankly confused
The doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator
Hes

gone Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the
carpet He
is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath

His poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor
LAURA

(off)
I remember Henry
Simon doesnt register this right away But then he

looks up

and over at the receptionist

Laura stands and comes around her desk She pauses
seeing

his disappointment then comes closer and picks up his
poem

INT THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT

Later that evening

The whole neighborhood is celebrating Fays wedding
music is loud The people are drunk The place is a
A big dance number is playing Amidst all the

though Simon and Bufiuel have the small TV propped up
of the fridge following the evening news

REPORTER

(on TV)
It all started right here in Queens
Jim at World of Donuts about one
year ago today when local garbage
man Simon Grim put pencil to paper
and began to compose what many have
come to regard as vicious antisocial
and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines
of unrhymed free meter verse which
would one day serve to spark the
flames of controversy across the
nation and -- indeed -- the world

Fay leads the neighbors in the dance

OWEN FEER
(on TV)

This is outrageous Measures must be
taken Have we debased our culture
to such an extent that a garbage man
with a head full of sick ideas is
legitimately referred to as a poet
and where the filth he spews can be
accessed by any child old enough to
turn on a computer Is this what we
have come to Not the transmission
of our highest ideals but a cynical
atheistic delirium

Henry and Fay dance surrounded by the dancing
neighbors

POET LAUREATE

(on TV)
Poetry of this kind and this poem
in particular is I think a worthy
form of desperation a digression on
the extremes of human experience of
solitude of community It is perhaps
alarming even upsetting to some --
myself included -- but it must be
allowed to exist

Henry throws an arm around Warren who stands looking
dejected

in the doorway and raises his glass to the happiness
in the

room

ANCHORMAN

(on TV)
Meanwhile in Rome today the Pope
issued a message of hope for believers
in their fight against what he termed
the godless and lost He did not
mention Simon Grim by name but
offered a prayer for the young whom
he described as sadly in need of
faith and not the illusion of
conviction offered by rock music
drugs and contemporary poetry

The TV is switched off Its later now People are
passed

out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are
sitting

around the table Fay steps back from the TV drains a
glass

of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her
wedding

gown She hugs Simon who is deeply unsettled by the
news of

his growing infamy

FAY
God Simon I mean like youre a
total fucking rock star
INT WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

A huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors

Simon thinks this over but says nothing Angus comes
over
and lays his hand on his shoulder
ANGUS

Simon nods
EXT WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

Moments later

Angus emerges and has to fight his way through the

throng of

excited adolescents He reaches his limo and gets in
But he

pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd

Simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming
and

shouting for autographs Angus shakes his head

Their hearts are in the right place
too much of the time They get
sidetracked Distracted Oh How
could I have been so careless

SIMON
Henry please let me read the
Confession

HENRY
No Not now Its not done Im all
washed up Im finished

SIMON
Angus James is convinced my poem is
going to make him incredibly wealthy
Hell read your book and seriously

it over then

HENRY
Really You really think so

Having finally got through to him Simon comes forward
anxious to help Henry

SIMON
Ill insist he publish the

He paces back and forth thrusting out his chest for
first time in his life displaying something like pride
arrogance
SIMON
(adds)
Or I wont let him publish my poem
Henry sits there watching Simon impressed with this
of increased self-esteem He realizes the profundity of

gesture

HENRY
Youd do that Youd do that for me

Simon stares off into the distance

SIMON
You saved my life

Henry is moved He stands and comes forward He grabs
friend by the shoulders and turns him around

SIMON
Yes

ANGUS
As part of our deal

SIMON
Yes

he removes his glasses and

Fay sits ten feet
ANGUS
Simon this book its Its really
quite bad

SIMON
Thats what you said about my poem

Angus pauses and figures He changes the subject

ANGUS
Im offering you a very real
expression of my faith in your
writing Two hundred thousand dollars
and a sixtyforty split

SIMON
But just exactly what is the nature
of your faith in my writing

ANGUS
Look Simon you dont require my
admiration You require my experience
as a publisher And that experience
leads me to believe your poem will
make more money than any book of
poetry ever published In history
Virtually make you a household name
within two years Youll never have
to work on a garbage truck again I
assure you Or do anything else for
that matter Whereas this Confession
by Henry Fool

He is at a loss for words

ANGUS
The most I can say for this is
The man is a scoundrel

SIMON
He taught me everything I know

ANGUS
No He encouraged all that was
expressive in you to become manifest
He inspired you to act He influenced
your perception

Simon waits a while staring at his shoes

SIMON
but

slowly

rush

looking

Fay

out

How about if my advance is only a

ANGUS
Its not about money Simon

SIMON
We could split the royalties

soaked

shopping bag he has with him He pulls out a couple of
cans

of beer and hands one to Henry

HENRY
Thanks

They look around seasoned conspirators and make sure

the

coast is clear Then they pop open the beers and toast
They drink Then

HENRY
How did it go

Simon pauses scared then gets up and crosses the
room He
looks out of the window and gathers his strength

SIMON
Listen Henry Angus James didnt
like your Confession

Henry looks at Simon blankly then blinks and looks
away

HENRY
Ah I see Well what now

SIMON
What do you mean

HENRY
Did he suggest changes

Silence Simon comes back and sits again

SIMON
No He didnt

HENRY
I mean after all there are things
I can do to make it more accessible

SIMON
Accessible

HENRY
I can soften up some of the language
and make it read easier Take out
some of the more intratextual
references and popularize the
underlying Sturm und Drang so to
speak I can change its mode Make
it more of a conventional novel
instead

Simon just stares at him blankly then sighs and shakes

his
head
SIMON
No Dont
HENRY
(laughing)
Oh Simon dont be such a purist I
appreciate your protectiveness but
the integrity of the work gives it a
durability that can sustain such
things
Simon comes over and lays his hand on Henrys shoulder
SIMON
No Really Henry Dont
HENRY
What are you saying that it doesnt
merit revision
SIMON
Im saying Angus James didnt
like it
He steps away and sits Henry pauses then approaches
and

leans down over him

HENRY
Well did you tell him what you think

SIMON
What I think doesnt matter

HENRY

Yes it does Youve got to use your
influence with him

SIMON
I gave it to him to read and he hated
it What more can I do

HENRY
You can refuse to let him publish
your poem

SIMON
I cant do that

HENRY
You said you would

SIMON
That was before I read your book

HENRY
(hit hard)
Oh

SIMON
(looking up at him)
I signed the contract Henry

Henry stands there a moment longer then lowers himself
into
the nearest seat weakened

SIMON
Look Henry what did you expect

HENRY
I I dont know Honesty perhaps

SIMON
(indignantly)
Look if I had told you when at
first I read it that I thought it
was no good what would you have
done

HENRY
I would have respected your opinion

SIMON
And insisted that theres no
accounting for taste

HENRY
Well is there

Simons words catch in his throat He turns away
frustrated
SIMON
I dont know I didnt bring it to
Angus because I thought it was good
I brought it to Angus because youre
my friend

HENRY
(staggered)
Oh how perfectly enormous of you
Simon

SIMON
(explodes)

Look Henry I did it I wrote I
wrote poetry because you told me to
I worked I worked while you sat
back and comfortably dismissed the
outside world as too shallow stupid
and mean to appreciate your ideas

HENRY
Is that such a priority Is that
some sort of measure of a mans worth
To drag whats best in him out into
the street so every average slob
with some pretense to taste can poke
it with a stick

SIMON
(sits tired)
Maybe Maybe it is

Henry just stares at him stands then turns on his
heel and
waves him off

HENRY
You must be pretty impressed with
yourself huh The all too obviously
talented new man the important new
voice the early clue to a new
direction or whatever etc etc
etc A popular new trend conveniently
packaged for the distracted young
herd You want to be liked more than
you know Simon Grim Youd be nowhere
without me and you know it

Simon hangs his head destroyed

SIMON
Im leaving

Henry is scared all of a sudden But he puts ona
defiant
exterior

HENRY
Yes Its time you left

He stands drinks and walks over to the window

HENRY
I saw you for what you were in the
beginning Simon I hold no grudge
and Im certain you will in time
leave some serious and small dent in
this world

SIMON
(weakly)
