INT BEDROOM DUPLEX - MORNING
FADE IN

A red translucent shadow drips down a bedroom wall like weak
rain bathing EVA KACHADOURIAN in it’s eerie glow

Fifty years old but looking a good ten older Eva lies in
bed eyes open staring blankly at the ceiling

OS beep of a digital alarm clock

She slams her hand down on the battered clock it’s face
cracked and fixed with tape

It’s glowing red digits read
730AM Thursday 26th April 2001

Disoriented she sits up and frowns taking in the unnatural
hue on her skin

Fumbling for her robe she knocks a bottle of pills from the
bedside table they scatter noisily across the floor

EVA
Shit

She drags herself out of bed and walks over to the doorway
Feet crunching over the spilt pills

Dazed she wanders down the hall towards the front door
squinting as she steps out into the bright morning light
EXT RUN DOWN DUPLEX SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Shivering a little she pulls her robe tight around her she
walks a little way down the drive then turns to look at the
building

The house looks like it’s had it’s throat slit

It’s splattered with red paint glistening in the sunshine as
it drips down the woodwork
Eva surveys the scene for a moment her face expressionless
she shrugs tiredly and casually pads back into the house
closing the door behind her

FADE TO BLACK

WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN
FADE IN
BCU SAME DIGITAL CLOCK but brand new it’s digits read
7 AM THURSDAY APRIL 26th 2000

Eva’s hand slams down on it

INT LARGE RANCH HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING ONE YEAR EARLIER
A ticking sound as a bluish gas flame sparks up on the ring

OS A man’s voice singing badly over the dull thud of a
shower

Eva (49 but looking 10 yrs younger) plops a European style
coffee pot on top of the range and picks up a spatula
flipping a piece of french toast that’s sizzling in a pan

LITTLE GIRL (0S)
No slime Mommy

EVA
OK Celie no slime

She presses the toast firmly into the pan making sure it’s
crisp before flicking it expertly onto a plate
INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Viewed from behind The white blonde hair of CELIA 7 sat at
the kitchen table

EVA leans in towards her face making dabbing motions with a
little sponge

Celia’s feet kicking under the table She whines and wriggles
but tries hard to stay still
CELIA
Daddy’s happy he’s singing

EVA
You could call it that

Eva drops the sponge in the bowl and wipes her hands

EVA
There’s a brave girl See that’s
better not so sticky now

CELIA
No Not so sticky

Celia throws her arms round Eva’s neck
Eva smiles but her eyes are welling up
REVERSE ON CELIA

A delicate innocent face ONE EYE BLANK LOOKING PROSTHETIC
stares eerily ahead

Eva extricates herself from Celia’s tight hug and turns back
to the stove brushing her eyes

EVA
Now eat your breakfast honey

CELIA
Daddy

FRANKLIN (Good looking muscular 40s) bounds into the
kitchen in a buoyant mood He kisses the top of Celia’s head
and whistling heads for the coffee pot

FRANKLIN
(to Eva)
Morning

EVA
(without looking up)
Morning

His hand brushes against Eva’s over the stove An awkward
moment something unspoken in their eyes Franklin pulls away
gingerly

FRANKLIN
Sorry
EVA
That’s OK

She smiles at him shy girlish

EVA
You’re in a good mood

FRANKLIN
(boyishly embarrassed)
And you know why

He gives her a quick peck on the cheek and is about to turn
back to the table when Eva pulls him closer and kisses him
deeply

BOY (0S)
Gross

KEVIN sidles into the kitchen dressed in a smart white
fencing shirt and black slacks

EVA
Oh you’re up

Eva and Franklin pull apart almost guiltily like a couple
of teenagers caught at it

FRANKLIN
Looking good

EVA
Wow what happened were all your
size one clothes in the wash

KEVIN
Some days you just wake up with a
sense of occasion

Kevin tucks the billowing shirt neatly into his pants

CELIA
Kevin looks handsome

He does look handsome and Eva looks at him with a hint of
pride

EVA
Yup your brother’s a
heartbreaker

Now don’t dawdle You’re supposed
to eat it not make friends with
it
Kevin plonks his open rucksack on the table with a clunk
It’s full of heavy yellow Kryptonite bike locks

FRANKLIN
See you’ve got some takers

KEVIN
Yeah should make a pile I can
charge twice what I paid for these
on the net

FRANKLIN
The next Donald Trump huh

Franklin begins to load some film into a professional looking
camera

FRANKLIN
Big job today KevMichelin tyres
I’ve found the perfect spot Just
hope the light holds out

Kevin nods disinterestedly

KEVIN
Right

FRANKLIN
Hey I ever show you how this camera
works

KEVIN

Only about a million times

Kevin starts filling his sports bag with arrows and the rest
of his archery kit

FRANKLIN
(trying again)
That reminds me we should shoot a
roll of you at archery practice
sometime soon
Capture that steely gaze and steady
arm for posterity

Franklin slaps Kevin on the back It’s a mistake Kevin
flinches his mask falls and for a split second Eva notices a
look of ‘revulsion’

KEVIN
Yeah Dad That would begreat
FRANKLIN
(seemingly oblivious to
Kevin’s disinterest)
‘course I’d have to shoot it ona
long lens you see the only way
to capture

KEVIN

(Levelly)
Listen I don’t care how your
stupid camera works I don’t want
to be a location scout for a bunch
of crappy products I’m not
interested I don’t want to play
Frisbee in the back yard or one
more game of monopoly with a candy
ass one eyed midget And I’ve had
it up to my eyeballs with heart-to-
heart father-son talks about
aspects of my life that are none of
your business

Franklin looks stunned flushed with a tinge of anger Eva
meets his eyes and just perceptibly shakes her head He
silently starts to fit his lenses back in the case

FRANKLIN
(slightly subdued)
OK You’re on the record

As abruptly as he had exploded Kevin folds right back into
himself He pours some cereal into his bowl

KEVIN
Can you pass the sugar please

Franklin slides the sugar in Kevin’s direction Kevin starts
to heap a disgusting amount over his breakfast

An uncomfortable silence No one makes eye contact like
polite people pretending they didn’t notice a very loud fart

Franklin studies the newspaper he’s already read and Eva
gathers up her purse and some paperwork

EVA
OK time to make a move

She bends to kiss Celia’s head brushing a last speck of
crust from her eyelash

Celia stands woodenly her arms held out
CELIA
I’ll miss you

Eva glances at her watch

EVA
I’1l miss you too

She hugs Celia taking her into her arms Celia clings on
desperately Eva finally manages to put her down She passes
Kevin on the way to the door

She almost makes a move to kiss him goodbye thinks better of
it and passes a hand over his fringe instead her hand
brushing against his forehead

EVA
Youre a little clammy do you feel
alright

KEVIN

Never better

EVA
Heythree days till you’re
sixteen huh We should do
something
How ‘bout Sunday

KEVIN
(noncommittally )
Don’t know might be tied up

Eva shrugs and picks up her bag kissing Franklin briefly on
the cheek as she passes on her way to the door

KEVIN
Don’t you want to say goodbye to
Celie on more time

EVA
(over her shoulder as she
exits)
Very funny

She closes the door behind her with a click

INT EVAS OFFICE - EVENING

Eva’s stockinged feet up on the desk viewed from behind she
swivels on the chair the phone pressed to her ear
EVA

(sensing someone standing

behind her)
Anyway see you tonight I’11l cook

She hangs up and swivels round in her chair
EVA
Haven’t you guys got homes to go
to
Her assistant ROSE is stood ashen faced in the doorway
ROSE
Eva your son’s at Gladstone High
isn’t he

INT EVA’S CAR - NYC STREETS - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - EVENING

Eva speeds through the traffic overtaking another driver who
screams at her and gives her the finger

She turns onto the West Side highway Total gridlock

She honks the horn furiously it merges with the cacophony of
other horns on the static freeway

Her fingers frantically fiddle with the digital radio as it
scrambles wildly in and out of frequency

‘Fatalities feared at Gladstone High’(Merges into A cheesy
inappropriate pop song) Shooting’Police trying to gain
access’ It fuzzes back to the song again and Eva thumps

the radio angrily with her fist

EXT ARIEL VIEW EVA’S CAR OUTSKIRTS NYC - EVENING

The badly tuned radio merges with Eva’s panicky voice

EVA (0S)
Kevinpick upKevin

number punched into the phone)
(MORE )
EVA (0S) (contd)
Franklinwhere the hell are
you Pick up the goddamned
phone

INT EVA’S CAR SUBURBAN ST - EVENING

Eva rounds the corner and slams on the brakes

An elderly couple crossing the road in front of her gawp at
her before continuing on at a snails pace Eva drums her
hands impatiently on the wheelC’monC’mon

LATER

A strange lull as Eva speeds past rows of white picket fenced
houses and neat manicured lawns No one around

Two wild looking dogs pull trash from an upturned can
snarling and showing their teeth
INT CAR - STREET LEADING TO GLADSTONE HIGH - DUSK

A helicopter chops noisily in the air just above her SIRENS
GETTING LOUDER

The fuzzy car radio suddenly starts blaring out ‘HEY MICKEY’
BY TONI BASIL

She turns into the drive leading up to the school passing

A group of teenage girls huddled together with their arms
round one another in a strange tableaux

It’s getting dark as Eva jumps out of the car leaving the
door wide open

VIEWED FROM INSIDE THE CAR AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

Red and blue sirens pulse eerily from emergency vehicles as
Eva stumbles through the lot towards the school

CLOSELY FOLLOWING EVA
Everything slows to a strange half speed as if underwater

Total chaos Teachers students and frantic parents in tears
or profound states of shock

Seconds take forever as Eva moves towards the hubbub
surrounding the gym

She catches the sight of a hysterical woman who we will later
know as MARY WOOLFORD a perfectly coiffured mother but with
black rivulets of mascara running down her face she looks
like a screaming clown

For a split second their eyes meet

OS The voice of a cop on a crackling radio merges into
an electrical roar

Cops are gathered round one of the gym entrances as a fireman
works at the door with a cutter

A arc of blue sparks fly into the night

A YELLOW KRYPTONITE BIKE LOCK clunks to the floor with a
sickening thud

Eva loses focus the red and blue lights scatter into
meaningless splotches

CUT TO BLACK

SCREAMS IN THE DARKNESS

EXT STREET BANOL SPAIN 1983 - DAY

A mass of half-naked teenage bodies writhe together piled on
top of one another screaming and yelling covered ina
viscous blood-red liquid Is this hell

SPLAT A tomato flies through the air and squashes against
the crisp white cotton of a women’s blouse

Eva (36 and gorgeous) squeals and laughs holding her hands
protectively over her face as more tomatoes fly in every
direction

Two young guys flirty and lascivious are pushed up against
her shouting and laughing they grab her arms and playfully
pull them from her face stretching them wide so Eva becomes
an open target for the rest of the crowd

Tomatoes rain down squashing as they hit their target and
soaking Eva in their sticky red mess

It’s fun at first but soon the chaos proves too much and Eva
pulls away from the protesting boys and struggles to free
herself from the crowd

EXT A QUIETER BACK STREET - DAY

Eva relaxes as she walks away from the frenzy of the
“Tomatina”the music and screaming fading into the
background her hair and clothes dripping with tomato juice
She pulls a fleshy lump from her hair and drops it in the
road laughing quietly to herself

INT SPANISH HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

The hiss of a shower steam fills the room

A pink-stained bra drops to the floor on top of a pile of
soaked clothes

Eva’s feet step into the shower the water running red round
her toes

Hands soap up a lather and caress the skin of her shoulders
neck breasts and belly sensuously

The shower head splutters and spits the steam disappears
Eva looks up and squeals - the water has gone freezing

She scrambles from the shower swearing to herself

INT A BASIC HOTEL BEDROOM - DAY

Eva sits on the edge of the bed goose pimpled shivering
slightly wrapped in a small cheap thin ‘bath’ towel

Hand written journals and notebooks are strewn across the
bed she flops down on her back and reaches for a Dictaphone
clicking record

Eva’s lips full frame
EVA
Bedrooms bearable plumbing
practically non-existent
She clicks it off with a sigh and casts her eyes round the

drab bare room something lonely about her She sighs and
turns on her side her gaze fixing on the phone

MOMENTS LATER

Eva’s fingers playfully twirl the chord of the phone as she
wanders aimlessly round the room

FRANKLIN PHONE VOICE
(tinny and distorted by
the long distance call)
So what you up to

EVA
Not much Just had a shower

She picks at a bit of tomato skin on her arm

EVA
huh well half a shower

MAN’S VOICE (0OS)
So you’re naked

She laughs and twirls round dropping the towel admiring her
toned body in the mirror

EVA
MmmmmYou know what I’ve got
great tits
She laughs sexy teasing blushing
CUT TO

Eva’s hair is fanned out around her on the pillow her face
flushed

FRANKLIN PHONE VOICE
Are you doing it now

EVA
Maybe

Her toes stretch out and she lets out a husky teasing laugh

FRANKLIN PHONE VOICE
Well do it faster

She focuses on the ceiling fan the blades whirring noisily

EVA PHONE VOICE
You want me to do it faster

OS Eva giggling sexily

EXT TERRACE RESTAURANT - EVENING

Eva eating alone marooned and lonesome

A couple of local Lotharios check Eva out from the bar she
ignores them

She watches a young pretty Spanish couple dining nearby
laughing noisily doting on their rambunctious kids

FRANKLIN PHONE VOICE (0S)
This is stupid come home

EVA (0S)

couple more weeks

Eva rushes through the airport something catches her eye

A LARGE STAND OF SHINY NEW ‘A WING AND A PRAYER’ TRAVEL
GUIDES

She smiles at a YOUNG GIRL with a backpack whos perusing
them

The girl flips the book over Eva’s face smiles back at her
from the book jacket”“written and researched by Eva

The girl double takes but Eva has already disappeared into
the crowd

Evas face full frame she allows herself a private
satisfied smile
EXT YELLOW CAB BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DUSK

THE MANHATTAN SKYLINE “Sweet dreams are made of this”

EVA (0S)

The music grows louder and continues over the following
scenes
INT YELLOW CAB - TRIBECA - DUSK

Eva’s face reflected in her compact mirror applying some lip
gloss tousling her hair sexily

Almost there She redirects the driver this is her city she
knows her way around

EXT TRIBECA STREET NYC - EARLY EVENING
The cab pulls up and Eva gets out

A handsome young BROKER GUY whose passing rushes up to help
her with her bags flirting a little as he helps her inside
the entrance of an industrial looking building

INT EVAS APARTMENT - EVENING
A whirring noise and a clunk

Eva chuckles to herself and thuds her foot on the floor of
the dilapidated elevator it swims up unsteadily to her
floor

She pulls the grate back excitedly and steps into the
apartment dragging her bags in after her

EVA
Franklin

THE MUSIC STOPS SUDDENLY
SLIGHT TIME CUT

She glances at the breakfast dishes still strewn messily over
the counter beside an open newspaper Looking a little
forlorn as her tinny voice resounds back at her

EVAS VOICE ON ANSWER MACHINE
Sorry babe everything’s delayed
-Can’t wait to see you (beep)
And don’t bother picking anything
upI’m gonna cook you a

Evas finger abruptly presses STOP on the player
LATER

Eva huffily scrapes the remains of dinner into the trash the
plates clash noisily into the sink

LATER
Eva sits at the kitchen table bored unwrapping a little
ornament a Spanish man in a Sombrero stood in a barrel She
presses the button on it’s base the barrel shoots down and a
big wooden penis painted red at the tip springs out

She sets it off again a couple of times until the joke isn’t
funny any more

LATER
It’s dark and feels late

Eva skulks across the room she trips over something and
almost falls flat on her face

She picks up an aging boxer’s jump rope scowling with
irritation

EVA
Jesus Franklin

But Franklin’s not there Eva looks a little silly as her
voice echoes around the empty loft

She throws herself down on the couch curling the rope
absentmindedly in her fingers

LATER STILL
Eva glances at the clock it’s way past midnight
Right that’s it Car crash He’s dead

She gets up and grabs the phone her hand hovering over the
nine of 911

She drops the receiver back in place C’mon Eva don’t be
ridiculous get yourself together
INT KITCHENLIVING AREA - LATER STILL

OS The sound of the elevator grinding to a halt three feet
below the entrance to the loft

FRANKLIN (0S)
Aw crap

Franklin will swear at the elevator every time he enters the
loft

The elevator grate wrenches open and an exhausted and totally
soaked FRANKLIN stumbles in carrying a large camera bag and
knapsack

EVA
Why the hell didn’t you call

He looks surprised and holds up his hands apologetically

FRANKLIN
Our van broke down twice We
weren’t near a phone

EVA
(Shaking with anger)
You could have found one if you
tried

FRANKLIN
I did try

Eva looks doubtful unimpressed

FRANKLIN
Jesus Eva I’m surprised

Eva frowns at him confused He turns his back on her pulls
a beer from the fridge and pops it

FRANKLIN
I mean my wife coming home is
hardly a special occasion these
days

Something comes hurling towards him and he ducks it hits the
wall and bounces onto the floor it’s the novelty Spaniard
and the lewd penis pops out Franklin’s laugh is silenced by
Eva’s glare but his grin is infectious and she can’t help
but laugh toothey both break into hysterics

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A pulsing red neon light from the Chinese restaurant across
the block strobes into the room alternately bathing the
scene in it’s glow or leaving it obscured in darkness

RED At first glance it looks like Eva and Franklin are
locked in a violent tussle as they furiously tear each others
clothes off

BLACK

RED Eva pulls Franklin’s damp T-shirt over his head and they
fall back on the bed wriggling nakedly

BLACK

RED Urgent and visceral in their movements as if they want
to consume one another They roll around in a tangle then she
moves on top of him She leans down kissing his neck She
can’t get close enough

BLACK

LATER -POST COITAL

Eva is dozy eyed but contemplative the trace of a smile on
her lips

The blackred light flashes on and off like a warning signal
EVA
(sleepily mumbled)
I didn’t put in my diaphragm

Franklin stirs and rolls over looking at her disoriented

FRANKLIN
Is it safe

Eva giggles

EVA
(affecting a German accent)
Is it safe

Franklin laughs

FRANKLIN
Is it

EVA
(in a poor Dustin Hoffman
impression)
No it’s not safe it’s very
dangerous Be careful

They both laugh and he pulls her into his arms

Black

INT BEDROOM - MORNING
OS Pee bouncing around in the bowl

FRANLIN (0S)
Last night you didn’t just forget

Eva peers over the quilt sleepy eyes huh
She shakes her head coyly

Franklin appears lifting her off of the bed leaving her
impression on the empty crushed pillow

Her feet twirl into frame as he spins her round Her toes
wriggle girlishly

FRANKLIN (0S)
That’s great

He dumps her back down kissing her deeply then leaves her
face flushed bouncing up and down on the mattress

OS Him bawling out ‘Born in the USA’ over the dull thud of
the shower

Eva rolls her eyes at his cheesiness
Her eyes drift to the window the sky is dark grey clouds
gathering ominously Her smile starts to fade and is replaced

by a slightly apprehensive look

It starts to rain

INT EVA’S OFFICE - EVENING
Rain pours down a window It’s getting dark

Eva sits in her office behind a glass partition looking out
at a newly decorated space Graphic pictures of exotic places
and enlarged framed covers of ‘A Wing and a Prayer’ lean
against the walls ready to be hung

She watches as a painter folds his ladder up and waves to her
on his way out A camp looking guy with a satchel bag hung
round him pokes his head round the door

JON
Looks great huhEva’s empire

Eva smiles

JON
You want me to lock up

EVA
It’s OK you go I’1l do it

LATER

Eva stands at the door and takes a final look round the
almost finished’ modern space’ The shiny new desks and state
of the art computers She smiles to herself a glimmer of
pride in her eyes then something else apprehension

Her hand reaches for the light switch and the fluorescents
lazily flicker off just at that moment a clap of thunder
outside merges with

CUT TO

A THUNDEROUS ROAR LIGHTS FLICKERING ON AND OFF AS THE SUBWAY
CARRIAGE SHUDDERS SHAKILY ALONG THE TRACKS

0S Garbled drunken ravings merge into singing

A grimy drunk tramp wobbles unsteadily through the carriage
ignored by the other passengers he obviously stinks He
almost falls into an empty seat

He garbles on unintelligibly then in a moment of lucidity he
gestures dramatically round the carriage

TRAMP
We’re all the same me and you
We all come from somebody’s cunt

He cackles at himself

TRAMP (0S)
(almost weeping with
laughter)

We all come from somebodys cunt

Eva glances round the carriage of tired irritable passengers
the tramps words echoing

CLOSE UP on faces all different shapes colors sizes
The light flickers out again as the train roars into a
tunnel

BLACK The repetitive clack clack of the train on the rails

INT KITCHENLIVING AREA - MORNING
The crockery on the work surface rattles rhythmically
VOICE ON ANSWER PHONE
Eva Eva pick up it’s
urgentwe’ve got twenty minutes
to approve the proofs Call me

Eva hands roam awkwardly for a space amongst the dirty
dishes The salt cellar falls over

Franklin’s face is screwed up in concentration and effort as
he pumps away forcefully behind her

As he pushes into her her palm presses into a gooey mess of
ketchup and leftover bacon on a greasy plate

Franklin groans and comes
OS The sound of Franklin zipping and buckling up

He looks at his watch then leans in and gives her a quick
peck on the cheek

FRANKLIN
Shit sorry babe gotta go

He turns and hurriedly grabs his camera bag
OS The sound of the elevator cranking open

FRANKLIN (0S)
See you laterI love you

OS The doors clank shut

Leaving Eva still standing legs akimbo with her panties round
her ankles She looks at her ketchup stained hands with
disgust and wipes them on a dish cloth before bending to pull
up her knickers She sighs and starts to tidy the breakfast
things

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

OS The dull thud of a jump rope sounds over a loud TV

A stream of bloody pee runs into the toilet bowl

Eva breathes a sigh of relief

She pulls up her knickers and washes her hands

INT LIVINGKITCHEN AREA - NIGHT

Franklin has his back to Eva he’s dressed in an ancient 70’s
rock band T and shorts skipping in front of the blaring TV
soaked with sweat

Eva walks to the kitchen area flicks the switch of the
kettle and reaches into the cupboard Almost instantly
Franklin is behind her his sweaty body rubbing into hers

EVA
Not nowI got my period

She turns to him making an effort to look regretful when she
see’s a flicker of disappointment cross his face

FRANKLIN
Never mind we’ll just keep trying
hey

He takes her in his arms Eva’s face visible over his
shoulder looks less than enthusiastic

INT LIVING AREA - NIGHT

Eva’s head visible over Franklin’s burly shoulders is lodged
awkwardly up against the arm of the sofa she winces a little
as Franklin’s piston like fucking intensifies

“Ker-bang ker-bang ker-bang”

LATER

VOICE ON THE TV (0S)
and so after this arduous
prodigious struggle the female
salmon finally reach their
destination

Tight on Eva staring at the ceiling

EVA
Do you think you’1ll miss itjust
the two of us

She turns to look at Franklin whose sprawled head back and
snoring lightly She studies his open mouth drool collecting
in the corner He farts loudly and rolls over

Eva grimaces and turns her attention to the TV

VOICE ON THE TV (0S)
and can lay their eggs ready to
be fertilized by the waiting males
Unfortunately for them once the
task is complete they will die
leaving a feast for the waiting
birds and maybe even the bears

Shots on the TV of milky eyed greasy looking dead fish lying
belly up in the water

She grabs the remote and flicks the channel

INT LOFT - EARLY EVENING

Eva throws herself down on the sofa and takes a deep slug
from a glass of red wine A huge new book lies open on the
coffee table THE EVERYTHING PREGNANCY AND NUTRITION GUIDE
She picks it up

EVA
(American Info-mercial Voice)
Twenty things you should do before
you get pregnant
Just say no to partyingGive that
cup of Joe the old heave - ho

The patronizing text quickly induces another slug of wine
OS THUNK

She looks up to see Franklin head buried in the fridge
throwing a big chunk of her bluest stinkiest cheese into the

trash

EVA
Hey What the hell

She snaps the book closed

EVA
That’s my favorite

FRANKLIN
If you’re gonna do something

She rolls her eyes and pads down the hall with the glass of
wine still in her hand

FRANKLIN (0S)
And easy on El Vino from now on

EVA
(under her breath as she
walks into the bedroom)
Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh

INT EVA’S CAR - DAY

Eva drives distractedly she glances at her handbag which
sits on the passenger seat a sealed pickle jar pokes out of
the bag the greasy yellow contents swilling around with the
movement of the car

OS The loud honk of a horn

Eva looks up she’s rapidly approaching a line of stationary
traffic at a stop sign

EVA
Shit

She stamps on the brakes Her bag slides forward on the seat
teetering on the edge Eva reaches for it and grabs it before
it falls breathing a sigh of relief

INT SURGERY - DAY

OS The sound of blood rushing in her ears as Eva’s vision
blurs for a second she swoons forward her head between her
knees

Eva’s ankles and shoes full frame against the white tiled
floor

DR RHINESTIEN (0S)

Are you okay Eva this should
be good news

INT KITCHENLIVING AREA - EVENING
Hands straightening up the dishes on a beautifully laid out
table until it looks perfectbut looking closer the hands

are shaking

PULL OUT

Dressed in the simple white smock with little make -up on
Eva looks fresh and young The picture postcard of a
wholesome mother to be

OS The cranking of the elevator

She rushes to the kitchen counter pretending to busy herself
with the salad her back turned to the elevator

Franklin walks into the apartment takes the scene in and
immediately stops in his tracks

FRANKLIN
You’re pregnant

Eva turns and flushes She can’t conceal her disappointment
at having lost her big moment She shrugs

EVA
Looks that way

LATER -
Eva picks up a waiting champagne bottle from it’s ice bucket
and goes to fill Franklin’s glass but he covers it with his

hand

FRANKLIN
Hey c’mon we’re in this together

He grins and picks up the cranberry juice pouring himself a
healthy glass holding it up for a toast

FRANKLIN
La chaim

They clink glasses and Eva takes a swig barely managing to
disguise a grimace at the disappointingly sickly sweet taste
of the juice

FRANKLIN
Welcome to your new life

Eva grins but as Franklin digs into his meal she looks with
a little regret at the discarded champagne bottle

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

OS Franklin whistling cheerfully from the bathroom

Eva pulls off her white dress and looks at her flat stomach
in the mirror running her hand over it ruefully

TIME JUMP

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Hands rifling through the wardrobe rail flicking passed
endless hangers rejecting them all

Eventually a smart rain coat is pulled out

Eva stands in front of the mirror with the coat on

From the front it looks OK but when she turns to the side it
looks ridiculous she can’t even belt it She casts it aside
on the bed

Close in High heel shoes clacking in front of Eva

The back of a WOMAN wearing a trench coat like the one Eva

Eva struggling with too many grocery bags whilst trying to

and walks right past

INT THE LOFT - EARLY EVE

Franklin stumbles into the apartment his face obscured by

heavens )
Feel the baby deep insideFeel

nervous involuntary giggles Franklin laughs a little with

her

The pregnant woman and their partners open their eyes they
all start to clap
Eva stares around at the others blankly

INT FRANKLIN’S PICK UP - DAY
The pick up pulls up at the lights

EVA

Eva laughs

EVA

INT BEDROOM - MORNING SOME MONTHS LATER
Eva in bed Alone Swollen sweating

A print of Degas’s backstage dancers Eva stares at the
girls who seem to somehow be mocking her in return

Eva closes her eyes praying for the sickening moment to
pass

Franklin enters the darkened room and sits on the bed

FRANKLIN
Promise me you won’t go to work
today

Eva is about to protest

FRANKLIN
(firmly)
Promise

Eva nods imperceptibly Franklin kisses her on the forehead
then rises and heads for the door

FRANKLIN
Why don’t you fix up the nursery if
youre bored You’ve hardly looked
at it

INT LOFT - DAY

Eva wanders around aimlessly enjoying the late afternoon
sunshine She looks a lot fresher but clearly at a loose end

She passes a shelf stacked with records and flicks through
them slides out a Billy Joel album smiles at the cheesy
cover and returns it to the shelf She rubs her bulging
belly

EVA
Hey KidLets hope you have better
taste in music than the old man
huh

She flicks to the back of the stack her old ‘single life’
records

EVA
Aha

She pulls out Talking heads ‘Speaking in Tongues’

Eva sets the needle on the record and ‘Burning down the
house’ bursts into the room she whacks the volume up herky-
jerkying awkwardly and humming along

She catches her reflection in the mirror and pushes out her
huge bump comically

EVA
You’d better not give me stretch
marksyou little bastard

She holds her big belly in her hands and steps awkwardly onto
the couch jumping up and down in time to the music

SCRREECH The music stops the needle dragged off the record

EVA
Hey

She turns mid leap to see Franklin glowering at her

FRANKLIN
What the fuck are you doing trying
to have a miscarriage

EVA
Having a good time for once is
that illegal

She plonks herself down on the couch

FRANKLIN
AwwwStop feeling sorry for
yourself and grow up

EVA
What’s the matter Franklin Am I
not playing mommies and daddies
right Christ if I’d known that’s
what you were expecting I wouldn’t
have bothered
Franklin’s face turns beet red
FRANKLIN
(quietly furious)

It’s too late for second thoughts
now Eva

INT HALLWAY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

OS The sound of running water

Eva appears from the bathroom passes the door of the new
nursery hesitates then pushes it open

The room is full of boxes the crib set up in the middle of
the floor caught in the glow of the street lights

She pulls the baby blanket from the crib draping it round
her shoulder and twists the mobile hanging above it

She sits on one of the boxes the simplistic chimes of
‘Twinkle twinkle little star’ play round endlessly

CUT TO BLACK
OS Animalistic unearthly moans

DR RHIENSTEIN (0S)
Eva you’re resisting

EVA
(a furious screech)
It’s killing me
CUT TO

Lights a light a singular blinding light

Tight on Franklin’s big hand held in Eva’s vice like grip
till it’s painful white knuckled about to be mashed to a
pulp and then it’s suddenly released

Pan down from the big white light to find a baby kicking
furiously in space ugly and red like a peeled monkey held
up by disembodied hands for Eva’s inspection

The thing is plopped flaccidly on her stomach and she cranes
to look at it

It studies her back a disgruntled ‘old man’s face’ It’s
black hole of a mouth screeching at the top of it’s lungs

EVA
(mumbled automatically)
He’s beautiful

The nurse helps to guide the baby to Eva’s nipple but it
wriggles away from it in fury

NURSE(OS)
Don’t worrythey don’t always
take to it first time

FRANKLIN (0S)
(choked up)
Can I

He leans in ever so gently picks him up
It’s love at first sight

Franklin closes his eyes and presses his cheek against the
baby’s who stops screaming

Eva watches them bond at a loss for what to say or do
Feeling remote from the whole thing she looks
blankboredlost

FRANKLIN
(looking up at Eva)
Kevin

An exhausted Eva nods almost imperceptibly Franklin smiles
returning his attention to his bundle of joy

FRANKLIN
Kevin
(magnanimously)
Katchadourian

FADE TO BLACK

A distant wail like a lone siren builds and builds into an
unearthly roar

FADE UP ON the Tribeca loft viewed from the street below

The sound of a baby crying resounds round the block if not
the whole neighborhood

FRANKLIN PHONE VOICE
(through a mouthful of
lunch)
It says heresmile at your baby
often The baby will mimic you and
smile back

INT THE LOFT - DAY

Kevins face screwed up in anger and almost turning purple
from the effort as he screams incessantly

EVA
(not convinced)
Really
Eva smiles desperately at Kevin

LATER

Eva jiggles up and down on the spot stiffly awkwardly
Sensing her unease Kevin’s screams intensify

She scoops a breast from her open shirt and offers him one of
her already raw looking nipples

He takes it in his mouth for a second before turning away and
spewing out the milk in a bluish dribble

EVA
No

CUT TO
Kevin still wailing kicks his legs wildly as he lays on his
back on the changing table Eva checks his dry diaper and

reseals it

She puts him back in his crib and waves the mobile at him but
he kicks it away in fury

MUCH LATER

Eva pacing up and down the loft cooing humming and jiggling
the screaming bundle in her arms

EVA
Goo goo goo gah gah (her forced
smile drops) Please be quiet
please

OS A ping and the grinding crank of the elevator as it
ascends from the first floor

As if on cue Kevin falls silent Eva’s mouth falls open in
shock gingerly she creeps to the cot and lays the baby down
with infinite care

OS The elevator grate grinds open

Franklin bounds in another stuffed toy under one arm piles
of prints from work under the other

FRANKLIN
How’s my little man huh

EVA
Please don’t wake him he’s only
just

She winces as Franklin takes Kevin in his arms but the baby
stays miraculously silent nestling quietly in Franklins
huge arms He coos and grins a bit more before looking up

FRANKLIN
Any better on the feeding

Eva shakes her head listlessly

EVA
Rhinestein says it might be a diet
thing I’1ll try cutting a couple of
things out

FRANKLIN
(instantly returning his
attention to the baby)
Well we want our boy to grow up big
and strong don’t we Yes we do

EXT STREET OUTSIDE THE LOFT - MORNING

Franklin swings his bag over his shoulder as he leaves the
apartment building

He looks up to see Eva watching him from the loft windows He
waves and blows her a kiss before climbing into the pickup

INT THE LOFT - MORNING

Eva waves to Franklin and watches as he drives off tooting
his horn

A prodigious screech from behind her as kevin starts up
again

Eva walks leadenly over to the crib and picks him up

INT A CAFE - DAY

A young waitress strains to hear Eva’s order over the
constant screams emanating from the pram next to her

EVA
(exhausted thinner)
Do you have any gluten free bread

The bored waitress shakes her head

EVA
Ok a bowl of plain pasta no
chilli no garlic and a green
salad hold the dressing

The waitress nods and scoots off

Eva jiggles the pram uselessly Kevin seems to redouble his
efforts

Other diners turn and give unfriendly glances which Eva tries
to ignore

MAN (0S)
For Christ’s sake Somebody shut
that kid up

An old woman leans over from the next table

OLD WOMAN
Have you tried feeding him honey

EVA
(trying to keep her cool)
Yes I’ve tried feeding him

OLD WOMAN
Well he sure sounds hungry to
me

Enough Eva slams a twenty from her purse on the table and
storms off just as the waitress reappears clutching a
steaming bowl

WAITRESS
Hey what about your

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY

A juggler’s glass balls jump into the air distorting his
pudgy face and tell tale alcoholic’s nose as he recites a
‘right on’ little mantra part of his ‘act’ surrounded by
kids and moms

JUGGLER
Children will show love If you
show them love Children will grow
up to be strong when surrounded by
strength

Eva pushes Kevin still screaming in his buggy to the back of
the crowd The juggler looks irritated but continues raising
his voice considerably

JUGGLER
Children will be
(shouting now)
Children will be patient If you
show them understanding Children
will be

The juggler glares at Kevin’s balled up face he’s rapidly
losing business Eva feeling like a leper wheels Kevin
away

EXT NEW YORK STREET - DAY
Eva looks exhausted as she pushes the pram out of the park
the walk has done nothing to settle her nerves or Kevins

he’s still screaming blue murder

She passes a group of construction workers digging up the
road A pneumatic drill hammering up the tarmac

Eva stops on the sidewalk and looks down at Kevin’s twisted
face his incessant bawling drowned out by the drill

She stands stock still closes her eyes drinking in the
moment of respite provided by the noise Passers by throw
questioning glances but Eva’s oblivious to them all

INT THE LOFT - DAY

Eva stands over the sink sweaty and pale

OS Kevin crying in the background

She winces as she removes a breast pump from her tender
nipple

She makes towards the cot pauses she can’t face it
She switches on the radio Beethoven at his most jubilant
blasts out for a moment it covers the sound of the screams
Then the crying just gets louder
Eva turns up the radio

CUT TO
Kevin on his back in the crib pauses a moment for breath
then starts again prodigious wailing louder than ever
before

CUT TO
Eva’s hand as she turns the volume up on the radio

CUT TO

Kevin flings his arms wide his back arched as he pushes out
an even louder yell

CUT TO

Eva twists the volume up further still classical music
booming round the loft

CUT TO

Close up on Kevin’s mouth a bottomless black hole - as the
roaring gets louder and louder

CUT TO
Eva turns the volume up full the music painfully loud

Kevin’s screams only vaguely audible in the background She
throws herself down on the couch

Stalemate

INT LIVING AREA -EARLY EVENING

Eva looks dreadful almost catatonic curled up on the sofa
with a blanket draped around her shoulders seemingly
oblivious to the unending screaming

Feeling a sudden sharp stab of pain in her breast she opens
her robe and examines a small bright red patch of tender skin
developing under her swollen cracked nipple

OS The elevator pings and Kevin immediately falls silent

EVA
That’s right daddy’s home

Franklin walks in and drops his bags with barely a glance at
Eva he immediately makes a beeline for Kevin’s crib

FRANKLIN
Hey sorry I’m late just got called
in on another job Seems I’m more
popular than ever

EVA
He’s outdone himself today

Franklin leans in and picks up Kevin who stays sound asleep
his face content

FRANKLIN
I can’t believe this little angel
could have been grouchy all day

EVA
You think I’m exaggerating

FRANKLIN
I didn’t say that

She waddles towards him with the blanket still wrapped round
her following him into the kitchen area

EVA
You realize that John downstairs is
threatening to move out

FRANKLIN
John’s a fag and fag’s don’t like
babies

FRANKLIN (contd)
This whole city’s anti-childI’m

Kevin rouses and quietly takes the bottle offered by
Franklin

FRANKLIN
See He seems pretty good natured
to me

EVA

He’s not good natured he’s
exhausted and so am I I think I
might be coming down with
something

He holds a hand to her forehead briefly perfunctorily

FRANKLIN
Touch warm Go get some rest I’1l1

She shuffles back to the couch looking a little crest fallen
at Franklin’s lack of attention

FRANKLIN
Look EvaIf you’re having trouble
coping we could always hire
someone

He plods off to the kitchen

INT THE LOFT - EVENING

The bathroom door opens and Eva emerges huddled in her
blanket a thermometer poking out from under her tongue She
takes it out and tries to focus

EVA
Here you read it everythings a
bit blurry

He puts down Kevin ignoring his instant screams and scoops
Eva up in his arms carrying her to the couch

INT THE LOFT - DAY

Hazy sunlight catches Franklin’s relaxed smile He strokes

indescribable

Franklin and LOUISE (BRIAN’S WIFE) nod approvingly their
eyes misting over slightly playing back private memories

OS Muted cries from the other room but not Kevin’s

Eva follows the sound bending to pick up Siobhan’s Chinese
scarf from the floor it’s torn to shreds

Eva enters the bedroom Siobhan leans over Kevin (almost one
and a half now) on the changing table her hair tangled and
caught in Kevins vice-like grip She slowly manages to
extricate herself

SIOBHAN

Eva grimaces

EVA
(placating)

INT KITCHEN - LATER

up but still looks like shit Much thinner than she was
before and with dark circles under her eyes

She sits down at the table and stirs her coffee

begins a hideous discordant clanking

SIOBHAN
Thanks oh by the way we’re
almost out of baby food

EVA
Again

SIOBHAN
(almost tearful)
It doesn’t all go in his mouth you

A uncomfortable silence
OS The xylophoning stops replaced by a high pitched wail
Eva and Siobhan look at each other but neither makes a move
from the table
SIOBHAN
(opening the floodgates)

Eva I’m knackered

Eva sags she knows what’s coming next

seems to penetrate making Eva uncomfortable The woman bats
flies away from the baby’s mouth without dropping her soulful
eyes The children chase the tyre screaming and whooping in
ecstatic delight

feet as she looks up at the departure board panels flip over
like cascading dominoes‘DELAYED’ ‘DELAYED’ ‘DELAYED’

vending machine no water left only Fanta orange She takes
a slug from the drink It’s warm and she almost spits it over
the floor

INT JFK AIRPORT -DAY

EVA
I missed you so much
Mommy’s never going to go away for
this long again

Kevin seems to get floppier still his head lolls back over
her arm until he’s almost horizontal she pulls away from him
and ruffles his hair Wiping her cheeks she stands up and
hugs Franklin they kiss passionately

Kevin stamps his foot and begins to make a loud mooing sound
he tugs at Franklin’s hand

Franklin pulls away from the her

carrier bag waving it in front of him Kevin is
uninterested

changes instantly she looks at the room in horror

The walls are spidery with red and black ink the ceiling

directions

Kevin is standing on the desk bent over in concentration
draining the last of the red ink from the bottle and pouring
it intently into the barrel of his gun the ink spills over
onto the already splattered oak desk his hands are drenched
He senses Eva standing watching him but he doesn’t look up

almost as if to propose a toast except that he lets it

fall and smash one after the other

OS A scream

Eva runs to the bathroom door Kevin has his back to them
whispering to VIOLETTA (the little girl with eczema)

She has her eyes closed her expression ecstatic and she
is scratching herself to ribbons blood runs freely from the
hundreds of scabs she has scratched off her body dripping
slowly onto her white ankle socks

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Franklin bangs a glass down on the counter and pours himself
a generous scotch Eva sits at one end of their new white
sofa

FRANKLIN
He’s not her minder Eva he’s a
kid

EVA

He could have called someone
couldn’t he Before it went too
far

FRANKLIN
For Christsakes how’s he supposed
to recognize what ‘too far’ is
when all she’s doing is scratching
None of which explains why you let
him squish around the house all
afternoon from the looks of him
plastered in shit

(MORE )

FRANKLIN (contd)

Does it occur to you that if this
little scene was all that terrible
then he might be a little
traumatized himself

EVA
He wasn’t traumatized he was smug

FRANKLIN
What is wrong with you

He moves to sit down next to her but almost lands on a huge
smear of shit streaked down the sofa

FRANKLIN
Shit

He jumps up and plops himself down at the far end his hand
to his forehead

FRANKLIN
Look I’m getting pretty sick of
this and not because of Kevin

Silence Eva and Franklin sit at opposite ends of the sofa
no eye contact The shit-smear drawing a dividing line
between them

EVA
Well you remember yesterday Mommer

to add and subtract to pay bills

be sure the calculator is right

KEVIN
Why would you use it at all if it
doesn’t always work

EVA
It always works

KEVIN
So you don’t need arithmetic

(flustered)
To use a calculator you still have
to know what a five looks like

Fifty three

Kevin stares at Eva in the eye lifelessly and drones ina
fast forward monotone

He counts up to fifty hardly pausing for breath

KEVIN
Now can we quit

Eva looks stunned she feels foolish She sits down beside
him and scrawls a bunch of numbers on a piece of paper

EVA
There Add that up then And
multiply it by twenty five while
you’re at it since you think
you’re so smart

She goes to hand him the paper Smells something

EVA
You did not

He looks at her smiling

A FEW MINUTES LATER

On the changing table Eva removes the stinky diaper She
somewhat gruffly lifts his ankles Sets out the fresh one
under his butt Her eye catches on his She studies him He
seems to be enjoying it

EVA
Are you having a laugh out of this
Are you

He doesn’t answer She finishes taping the diaper sides and
yanks up his pants putting him on the floor and turning to
wipe her hands

OS A squelchy farting sound The unmistakable smell
She turns round Kevin grins up at her

EVA
(screaming)
How do you do it You hardly eat
anything where does it come from

Eva is livid she grabs him dragging him towards the
changing table she loses it and before she knows it she’s
thrown him towards it

He sails though the air as if in slow motion and lands with a
dull thud against the edge of the stainless steel table

His head at a quizzical tilt he looks at her as if he is
finally interested in something

Kevin’s arm is splayed at an odd angle Eva looks terrified

He does not cry

OS Construction noise She glances out the window

EVA
(under her breath)
Jesusjust what we need another
Pottery Barn

She yawns and flicks on the CD player Elgar swims out and
she closes her eyes for a minute savoring the peace in the
music

KEVIN
I don’t like that turn it off

Eva sighs and flicks the music off resignedly

A long boring silence interspersed with beeping horns and
construction

EVA
(brightly forced)
What shall we do when we get home

No response She sighs

EVA
Shall we read a book

KEVIN
What if the book is boring

EVA
Then well find a different one

KEVIN
What if they’re all boring

EVA
I don’t think that’s possible
Kevin

KEVIN

I think it’s possible

EVA
When you grow up you’1ll need a job
and then you’ll have to be able to
read and write really well or no
one will want to hire you

KEVIN
Dad doesn’t write He drives around
and takes pictures

EVA
There are other jobs

KEVIN
What if I don’t want a job

EVA
Then you’d have to go on welfare
The government would give you just
a little money but not enough to do
anything fun

KEVIN
What if I don’t want to do
anything

EVA
I bet you will

KEVIN
I think I want to go on welfare

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Franklin slouches next to Eva on the couch Kevin sat on the
floor in front of them Braveheart is playing on the TV the
climactic scene Mel is tied to the rack slowly being
eviscerated

Eva squeals and holds her hands over her eyes Through her
fingers she notices Kevin look up at the screen casually
with no sign of reaction He’s more absorbed in coloring all
the white squares on a crossword in black

She turns to Franklin who’s virtually asleep and looking cute
as a button

EVA

FRANKLIN
Overjoyed I’m shocked I’m doing
what I can to make up for sorry

I’m damned if I’m going to let you
freeze out another kid of mine

Eva looks stunned

Franklin slams the dishwasher shut with an air of finality

INT LOT OF SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Mother’s hang in gaggling groups outside the school

couple of sheets of sugar paper She braces herself and opens
the door for him
EVA
(talking to Kevin voice)
Hey kiddo what you got there

Eva glances up at her reflection in the mirror Franklin is
crashing around in the bedroom

EVA

people

KEVIN
That’s what everybody calls it

EVA
Do you know what that means

Kevin rolls his eyes

KEVIN
The boy puts his pee-pee in the

KEVIN
Just because you’re used to
something doesn’t mean you like

crayon) You’re used to me

Eva looks at tiny Celia in her arms with a doting expression

EVA
Hey Kevin like to meet your
little sister

KEVIN
Why should I meet it It’s coming
home with us isn’t it That means
I’1l meet it everyday

He moves moodily towards the pitcher of water beside Evas
bed he dips his hand in it and moves towards the baby
splattering the drops from his fingers in the baby’s eyes
with a clinical curiosity

Celia twists a little disconcerted but doesn’t cry Eva
glances at Franklin uncomfortably as Kevin dips his hand in
the water again Eva tactfully moves her out of his reach

FRANKLIN
C’mon Kev mom’s got to get
dressed lets go find some snacks
huh

He leads Kevin away by the hand

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Celia’s little eyelashes bat sleepily as Eva rocks her gently
in her arms her tiny hand grips Eva’s thumb

Eva ecstatic amazed she holds Celia comfortably her round
face and wisp of blond hair make her look more like
Franklin’s child as she suckles quietly

The baby is done at her breast and she stands up jiggling
her a little and holding her over her shoulder to burp her

As she wanders round the room cooing to Celia She notices
an empty frame the Amsterdam photo’s missing She stops

Oh come on Celie it’s only flour

Eva bends down and wipes Celia’s hands Celia inspects them
carefully

CELIA
All gone

Eva nods

EVA
All gone can you lay the table

Celia nods happily and skips off to the table just as Kevin
(now ten but with the sullen moody air of a teenager) skulks
into the room

Celia rushes to him throwing her arms around his leg in a
tight grip

CELIA
Kewin Your my friend

Kevin shoves her away and slouches down at the table

KEVIN
Beat it Celie go get me a soda

Celia dutifully runs off to the fridge returning with a
coke

KEVIN
Not that one you idiot get me a
Dr Pepper

She runs off again Eva rolls her eyes

CELIA

Celia shakes her head warily Kevin reaches behind him and
picks up the tube of the vacuum cleaner and flicks on the
switch the machine comes to life with a roar

KEVIN
The VACUUM MONSTER

A high pitched scream Celia tears across the room and clings
on to Eva

CELIA

face disappears replaced by a cheerful smile just as
Franklin enters the room

Celia breathlessly excited to see Franklin runs off and
appears seconds later clutching a piece of paper

She rifles through the drawers but can’t find them she
empties out the laundry basket searching almost desperately
through the dirty clothes until she eventually pulls them
out

Celia runs into the room waving a piece of paper

CELIA

Eva winces expecting a rebuttal
Kevin takes the drawing
KEVIN
That’s nice Celie can you do me

Suddenly the expression on Kevin’s face changes he jumps out

of bed and runs for the en suite too late he vomits
copiously over the carpet

INT HALL — DAY

Eva struggles down the hall her arms full of laundry The
bathroom door is ajar she elbows it open

Kevin (now 14 skinny pointy faced but with brooding dark
good looks) stands hunched in the centre of the room his
trousers round his ankles beating himself off fiercely A
half empty pack of “land ‘o lakes” butter sits on the side of
the bath

Eva gulps but stares at him squarely in confrontation
expecting embarrassment Kevin shoots her a sleepy sly
grin but he doesn’t stop

Eva slams the door hard and stomps off down the corridor her
cheeks burning

OS A dry chuckle from Kevin

INT EVA’S CAR DRIVE - EVENING

Eva sat in her car the engine running She drums her
fingers on the wheel beeps the horn a few times

Kevin saunters out of the house dressed in a pair of jeans
that might have fit when he was ten they hover above his
ankles the zip doesn’t do up and the tight denim explicitly
reveals his package A tiny white T-shirt completes the look

She beeps again he seems to slow intentionally casually
opens the door

EVA
Can’t you wear something that
actually fits you

Kevin sneers at her and slips into the car
LATER

The car approaches the gates of the high school Kevin shifts
in his seat A dopey looking boy (LENNY) Kevin’s age
dressed in an identical miniature T-shirt and with a freshly
pierced nose glowing pussily skulks by the gates

KEVIN
Lemme out here

EVA
Sure don’t want to be seen
arriving with your mother do you

Kevin gives her a ‘that’s right’ look she stops and he gets
out sloping off with Lenny

EXT THE GYM - EVENING

Eva struggles to open the gym doors a large tray of
sandwiches balanced in her arms A good looking athletic
black kid immaculately dressed in a polo shirt and chinos
runs to open the door for her

BOY
(smiling broadly)
There you go Mrs Kachadourian

EVA
Thank youerr

BOY
SowetoSoweto Washington

Eva is about to go in when an impeccably dressed MARY
WOOLFORD and her daughter (LAURA)who’s sparkly dress looks
like it cost thousands push past almost knocking her tray to
the ground They ignore both Eva and Soweto who is still
holding the door open

Eva raises her eyebrows and pulls a face for Soweto’s
benefit he flashes a bright smile

They walk to the gym together a few parents hanging around
the keener students helping to fix the bunting and disco
lights

SOWETO WASHINGTON
See you later

He jogs off scooping up a stray basket ball as he passes he
turns and leaps gazelle-like in the air sending the ball
sailing the length of the gym and straight through the hoop

EVA
Hey nice shot

Soweto shoots back another winning smile

INT SCHOOL GYM - EVENING
CLOSE UP a small glass vial held in a man’s hand

PRINCIPAL
This is a crack cocaine vial

He passes it round a small group of parents
Mary Woolford hands it to Eva

MARY WOOLFORD

the budgetEvery kid will be
frisked on the way in

EVA
(to Mary)
Hey why don’t we just get Delta
force in to do the strip searches

MARY WOOLFORD
It’s not something to joke about

EVA
Okay
INT SCHOOL GYM - LATER
The cavernous gym is decked out with brightly colored bunting
and a large mirrored ball spins slowly round catching the
light echoey retro music

The kids line the walls trying to look cool no one dances

Eva notices Kevin keeping his distance slumped against a
pillar Lenny next to him laughing dumbly

Nearby Mary Woolford holds court
MOTHER (0OS)
Well doesn’t Laura look dazzling

tonight you must be so proud

Mary beams Eva rolls her eyes and turns away

SOWETO WASHINGTON
(appearing at her side)
Thought you might like some punch
Mrs Kachadourian

Another huge smile

EVA
(unaccountably embarrassed)
Oh surethanks Soweto

Eva takes a sip hiding her embarrassed grin Over the rim of
her cup she sees Kevin point in their direction whispering
something to Lenny who starts guffawing like a donkey

EVA
Could probably do with a slug of
Vodka

Soweto laughs She looks at the empty dance floor

EVA
Jeezis anybody going to dance at
this thing

The DJ segues into ‘STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN’

EVA
Christ Stairwaythat’1ll help

Laura Woolford and her little posse of ‘hot girls’ prance
past the boys eyes on them as they catwalk their way to the
rest room flicking their hair

They pass Kevin’s corner and alter their route taking a
detour as if being ten feet from these two is infectious

Eva’s sure she sees something in Kevin’s eyes as Laura
passes taking in her long shiny hair her incredibly short
dress

Her attention is diverted as a lone girl pale and geeky
walks to the centre of the floor

The poor girl’s mom is clearly ninety she’s dressed her for
a prom circa 1947 Puffy frilly dress patent shoes and a bow
in her hair

Extending her arms she lunges in ever widening circles eyes
closed oblivious to the fact that her enthusiastic twirls
are exposing her panties

Something beautiful in her total lack of inhibitionEva
can’t help but be enchanted

Suddenly out of nowhere Kevin appears heading towards her
like a scud missile calculated so that the girl’s next
pirouette will land her ear exactly in line with his mouth

He leans towards her whispers something She freezes Her
eyes darting left and right like she’d just woken up naked in
the street

Kevin sidles off

Everyone now staring at the girl sniggering openly as she
flounders back and forth a slow motion death dance
desperate to keep up appearances by bobbing to a few more
bars

Mercifully the track ends the girl hurriedly gathers up her
skirt and hobbles off to a darkened corner

She sits head down hunched over her elbows awkward each
hand fighting for cover under the other

Eva drains her punch now she really needs a drink

INT LOUNGE - EVENING

Franklin is still munching his way through a huge plate of
pasta Eva leans back in her chair a glass of wine in one
hand reading something aloud to him

EVA
(sarcastically)
Niger is part of Nigeria Nigeria

flows through

FRANKLIN
(holding a hand up)
Okay okay I get ityou can’t
say it’s not factual

Eva sneers
EVA
You do know that Mr Johnson’s

wall

FRANKLIN
You could have caused a pile up a
fucking catastrophe

Eva stays in the background her arms folded her face
withholding something satisfaction

INT LOUNGE - LATER
Back on Evas face as she pours herself another drink

OS The rise and fall of Franklins voice furiously
yellingthen a lull Kevin’s voice quiet reasonable
placating

Eva grins ruefully to herself here comes the horse-shit
Franklin appears much calmer he sits down beside Eva

FRANKLIN
Listen the whole caper was Lenny’s
idea he was only talking about
water babiesYou know how kids
think that sort of thing is funny

EVA
What about the bricks

FRANKLIN
Well they ran out of water
babiesbefore he know it Lenny
had pitched a stone when a car was
coming Kevin said he immediately
told Lenny not to do that since
somebody could get hurt

EVA
Yeah that sure sounds like Kevin

Franklin sighs

FRANKLIN
Jesus EvaIt was spectacularly
dumb he admits that Anyway they
ran didn’t get very far since he
realized running was crazy so he
grabbed Lenny’s jacket to put the
brakes onand here’s the thing
it seems our friend Lenny Pugh
already has something on his record
so Kevin took the rap I have to
say I felt kind of dumb for laying
into him like that

EVA
(incredulous )
You apologized

FRANKLIN
Sure any parents got to admit when
they make a mistake

Eva looks dumbstruck

INT HALL - DAY

Eva emerges from her study she hears muffled voices coming
from Kevin’s room she stops listens

glimpses someone who else could it be dressed in that

her She looks touched to see that instead of clothing
designed for an eight year old he’s made an effort lush
black slacks and a billowing white fencing shirt

She’s smiles about to compliment him when he turns around
gnawing chunks from the half-devoured carcass of a cold
chicken Eva turns white

EVA
I’m about to take you to dinner

Kevin wipes the grease off the corner of his smirking mouth

KEVIN
I was hungry You KnowGrowing
boy

EVA

Put that away right now and get
your coat

Eva turns angrily away from him and storms out of the room

INT HUDSON HOUSE RESTAURANT - EVENING

Kevin shakes his head to the waiter who shrugs and turns to
Eva she’s quietly furious

EVA

medium rare and a bottle of Merlot

She snaps the menu shut

EVA
Ohand bannoffee pie for desert

LATER

Eva is eating as Kevin rips a bread roll apart squeezing it
into tiny balls She frowns and takes a deep slug of wine

EVA
SoHow’s school going

KEVIN
It’s goingYou want my course
schedule

Eva tries hard not to get annoyed

EVA
What about your ah teachers Are
any of them you know especially

KEVIN
And what bands are you listening to
these days Next you can wheedle
about whether there isn’t some cute
little cunt in the front row that’s
got me itchy That way you can
segue into how it’s all up to me of
course but before balling the chick
in the hallway I might decide to
wait until I’m readyRight around
dessert you can ask about drugs
Careful like Cause you don’t want
to scare me into like lying my
head off so you have to say how
you experimented Finally once
youve sucked up that whole bottle
you can go gooey eyed and say how
great it is to spend quality time
together and you can put an arm
around my shoulder and give ita
little squeeze

Eva quickly pushes her plate aside abandoning the food she’s
over ordered

EVA
Alright Mr Snide what do you
want to talk about

KEVIN
This was your idea I never said I
wanted to talk about a fucking
thing

They sit in silence for a long moment Eva takes another deep
gulp of her wine Kevin pulls a complimentary crayon from a
rustic jar in the middle of the table He idly scribbles on
the paper table cloth

KEVIN
OK I’ve got a topic Youre always
griping about this country and
wishing you were in Malaysia or
something What’s your beef about
it

EVA
OKSince you asked

Eva sits back folding her arms

EVA
American’s are trusting to a fault
innocent in a way that makes them
stupid They are fat inarticulate
and ignorant They are demanding
impetuous and spoiled They’re self
righteous and superior about their
precious democracy and
condescending to other
nationalities because they think
they’ve got it right never mind
that half the adult population
doesn’t vote Worst of all they
have no idea that the rest of the
world can’t stand them

All the while Kevin’s eyes have been downcast still
scribbling

KEVIN
Wowthat’s a whole lot of
adjectives Let’s see

He looks at his markings on the table cloth ticking off a
list

KEVIN
Spoiled Well You’re rich and can
get pretty much anything you want
right Mmmm
Impetuous well that’s a pretty
good description of that speech you
gave right now
InarticulateLemme see Seems to
me I’m sitting across from the lady
who goes on these long rants about
reality TV when she’s never watched
a single show And that one of
youre favorite words Mumsyis
‘ignorant’ ‘Trusting’ with no idea
other people can’t stand them

He underscores that on his list

KEVIN
Well far as I can tell about the
only thing that keeps you and the
other dumb ass Americans from being
peas in a pod is that you’re not
fat and just because you’re skinny
you act self righteous
condescending and superior Maybe
Id rather have a big cow of a
mother who at least didn’t think
she was better than everybody else
in the fucking country

Eva sits in stunned silence the waiter passes and she
quickly signals for the check

INT HALL - DAY
Kevins door opens a crack
Eva peers in

No posters no smelly socks the bed made with boot camp
precision the shelves virtually empty apart from the copy of
Robin Hood and a couple of school books

She has a quick guilty snoop around but there’s not much to
find a stack of floppies sit next to the computer and she
shuffles through them weird names Nostromo D4-x She
picks one out at random puts the rest back and slips out of
the room

INT STUDY - DAY

Eva inserts the floppy into her disk drive and starts to
download the files

She restarts it but the screen just fills up with weird
numbers and error messages

INT AWAP OFFICES - AFTERNOON

As Eva bustles through the office doors she’s struck by the
odd silence in the office people at their desks with dark

nose

a bottle of Liquid Plummr she pours a healthy glug down the
sink

desperate She runs up the steps into the hospital building

The same hospital corridor where Eva waited for Kevin with
his broken arm The same green plastic chairs

Eva and Franklin sit in a heavy silence clutching each
others hand tightly A coffee with a crinkled skin sits sadly
on the table

Franklin stand up

SURGEON

there was too much damage I’m
afraid we couldn’t save the eye

INT FRANKLIN’S CAR HOSPITAL LOT - NIGHT

The engine’s running just to get the heating going Eva sits
shivering without a coat

An empty silence

Franklin knocks his head back against the padded headrest and
stares at the ceiling

FRANKLIN
I can’t believe you left it out

Eva looks at him stunned

FRANKLIN
I thought about not saying that

She licks her lips and starts to tremble

EVA
I didn’t leave it out

Franklin drops his head and sighs
FRANKLIN
Eva Don’t make me do this You
used that ‘Liquid Plumr’ on
Saturday I remember because you
went on about how the drain smelled
weird or something

EVA
I put it away back in that high
cabinet with the child lock on it

already clear

EVA

FRANKLIN

son
EVA
He was supposed to be looking after
her
FRANKLIN

Kevin did everything he should
have He said when she started to
scream he came running and when he
found out what it was he ran water
over her face and rinsed her eye as
best he could and then he called
an ambulance even before he called
me on the cellHe was a star

EVA
Timeit takes time for that stuff
to work Maybe he did wash it out
but when When he was finished

FRANKLIN

Eva starts to cry she presses her finger tips to her
eyelids

EVA

Celia’s afraid of everything
He did it Franklin oh he did it

counter

KEVIN
I am the context

He turns and leaves the room

INT LIVING ROOM- NIGHT - WEEKS LATER

the room the distinct shape of his archery bag draped over
his shoulder he’s followed by Franklin

KEVIN
Dad Prozac’s not that big a deal

some kind of anti-depressant

Eva sighs and rubs her hand through her hair she looks
stressed and guilty

EVA
Something came for you

She nods toward the large Fed Ex package on the floor Kevin
sullies towards it and starts to rip it open with Franklins
car keys

He pulls a bright yellow kryptonite bike lock out of the box
along with a spray of Styrofoam beans as Eva eyes him
suspiciously

EVA
What’s that for You don’t even
ride your bike

Franklin walks back into the room holding a beer as Kevin
pulls out another identical lock

KEVIN
Got these for a song off the net
I thought I’d make a bundle selling
them at school

Franklin pulls the remote off the coffee table flopping down
on the sofa next to Eva and switching on the TV

FRANKLIN
Good to see someone inherited your
business sense huh

EVA
(dryly)

Glad to see you’re being so
entrepreneurial
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

OS Franklin singing tunelessly over the thud of the shower

Eva undresses slowly she smiles to herself a little sadly
and gets into bed

She peers over the quilt and watches Franklin through the
open door of the en suite

He steps out of the shower and his body flits in and out of
view reflected in the mirrors still fit and athletic

He switches the bathroom light off and gets into bed

Dark apart from the hypnotic flashing light of the digital
clock REDBLACK REDBLACK

They both lie silent awake What more is there to say
He reaches out for her hand and pulls her towards him
kissing her tenderly on the forehead then more deeply he

moves on top of her

and turns in one movement shoots a perfect hoop that one
was all net

INT VIEWING GALLERY - HIGH UP IN GYM

“Tve run out of places and friendly faces because I need to
be free”

Kevins face handsome and focussed the best we’ve ever seen
him as he fits arrow after arrow into his crossbow and fires
again and again their whistle and dull thunk just audible
over the music

“Ive been to paradise but I’ve never been to me”

CLOSE UP the lone basketball is pierced by an arrow nailing
it to the floor It deflates slowly with a gentle hiss

INT TO EXT THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

The gym doors burst open they’re surrounded by police
gunman fireman and paramedics Kevin is led out calmly into

the circus

Helicopters swoop over head red and blue flashing lights
illuminate the dusk sky

Parents teachers and others crowd round in awe being held
back by more police and barricades

Evas taut pale face as she struggles through the crowds

Kevin now handcuffed is escorted to a police car and sat
down in the back the door closed behind him

Suddenly Eva’s desperate face appears at the window as she
cups a hand against the glass to cut out the reflection of
the flashing lights

CUT TO

EVAS POV

As she stares through the glass

Kevin regards her calmly placidly searching for something in
her eyes

Whatever it is he doesn’t find it and they stare at each
other silently for a moment before the car starts to pull
away

One last look from Kevin through the back window he seems
pleased with himself but he doesn’t smile

OS A scream Eva turns to see Soweto Washington being
wheeled out the gym two arrows sticking out of his muscular
thighs

Another gurney is wheeled out a blanket over the body but
Laura Woolford’s expensive bracelets and hundred dollar
manicure are unmistakable on the one exposed hand A scream
from Mary Woolford as she breaks through the crowd and throws
herself on top of the body sobbing uncontrollably

INT WAITING AREA POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Coffee cup Plastic cup Styrofoam coffee cup

OS Phones ringing muted sobbing distant voices Kevins
name mispronounced

Eva exhausted suddenly aged a dead look in her eyes
marooned on a black PVC sofa as people rush to and fro
blocking her from view

Her knee shakes involuntarily

YOUNG OFFICER (0S)
And see the little green and
white one that’s very rare from
the days before NYPD blue

A teenage boy sits across from her staring glassily into the
middle distance without seeming to ever blink his T-shirt
speckled with blood

Clutching her stomach Eva stands

The receptionist eyes Eva coldly and nods in the direction of
the rest room further down the hall There is a line

RECEPTIONIST
(without making eye
contact)
Youll have to wait
Eva meekly sits back down
LATER STILL
Almost alonea cleaner with a mop and a radio

EXT POLICE STATION LOT - NIGHT

She walks into the lot everything alien

Dazed she wanders past her car failing to recognize it the
first time down the row

Yet once she finds the car she becomes strangely calm
Sedate Methodical Keys Lights Seat belt Windshield
wipers on interval to clear the thin mist

INT CAR - NIGHT

Eva drives very slowly breaking on yellow coming to a
legally complete halt at the four way stop though there is no

traffic

LATER the car curves up the long drive to the house

Methodically she turns off the wipers and the lights then
locks the car

She picks a leaf off the windscreen scoops the jump rope off
the garage floor and hangs it carefully back on it’s hook on
the wall

INT KITCHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Darkness

OS The flick of a light switch

Eva enters the kitchen

The greasy breakfast dishes havent been tidied plates and
juice glasses still on the counter the answer phone bleeps
with a ton of messages The white muslin curtains of the

garden doors drift lazily in the breeze

EVA
FranklinCelia

Her own voice coming back at her unnerves her it’s sounds
small and tinny

She walks through the house flicking on lights
Nothing
She walks to the deck and looks out on the dark garden

She finds the switch for the floodlights pausing for what
seems like an age before she flips it

The wide panorama of the garden lit up like a surreal
painting The grass and bushes a vivid green The blue night
sky twinkling with stars as a backdrop

Celia

Splayed like a discarded rag doll lies in the grass A
single arrow pins her tiny frame to the ground

Franklin
Stark in the glare of the floods shafts of arrows through
his neck and upper body a tragic expression frozen on his

face profoundly disappointed

A pause

Eva switches off the floodlights

CUT TO BLACK

INT THE LOCAL GRAND UNION - EVENING

A huge woman struggles to reach into the depths of a
refrigeration unit and pulls out a five litre tub of ice
cream slapping it on top of her already mountainous shopping
cart piled high with groceries

Eva’s cart seems empty by comparison a half loaf of bread
and a bottle of white wine the only contents

She reaches for a carton of eggs and places them on the kiddy
seat of the cart flipping it open to check for breakages
they’re all whole

OS The squeaky wheel of another cart turning into the
aisle

Eva looks up A woman about her age in an outfit that may
have been fashionable ten years ago and appearing similarly
run down is perusing the milk cartons MARY WOOLFORD

Eva blanches with a look of shocked recognition pricks of
sweat dot her forehead

OS The sound of blood singing in her ears

She abandons her cart along with her embroidered Egyptian bag
and wallet and dives into the next aisle

INT THE GRAND UNION SOUP AISLE - EVENING

A tin of Campbell’s soup full frame

The rushing noise in Eva’s ears getting louder

She gets herself together and manages to peer around the
corner furtively Mary has gone

INT AT THE CHECKOUT - EVENING

Eva unloads her meagre groceries picks up the egg carton and
drops it onto the counter with revulsion it feels sticky

The young checkout girl flicks it open

CHECKOUT GIRL
Jesus all twelve

Eva looks around distractedly Mary had seen her after all
In fact she can make her out at the other end of the store
watching with an intense mixture of hatred and glee

EVA
(slightly unhinged)
I’1l take them as they are

CHECKOUT GIRL
But they’re totally

EVA
I’1l take them as they are

She hands over her credit card

CHECKOUT GIRL
(loudly as if talking to
the room)
Khatchadourian that’s an unusual
name

Eva pauses for a moment then smiles
EVA
(just as loudly)
Yep I’m the only one in the state

She snatches back her card and the bag containing the gloopy
eggs and strides defiantly out of the store

INT EVA’S CAR - DAY

Eva stops outside her run down vandalized duplex

A kid with a basketball in his hand stands staring at the
still-drying red paint

EVA
Jesus

She lets out a deep sigh she had forgotten

A man pokes his face out of a neighboring door and shouts
something at the kid who stands stock still for an instant
then scoots off His father ushers him inside and closes the
door

Eva turns into the driveway She goes to pick up her
groceries from her car the bag almost bursts open the gloop
from the eggs all over the passenger seat

EXT THE DUPLEX —- DAY

OS An abrasive scrubbing sound

A ladder against the white slatted wall

A watery red liquid rushes down in a sudden wash

Eva’s feet appear as she descends

A stained sponge and a scrubbing brush thrown into a bucket
of water

INT HALLWAY DUPLEX - DAY

Walking down the hall bucket in her hand

She catches a glimpse of her reflection in a mirror almost
jumps in fright

A red smear over her nose Her arms up to the elbow
glistening as if she’d just carried out a bloodbath

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Scrubbing her hands in the sink

She can’t budge the thin red line that stubbornly remains
under each fingernail

INT KITCHEN - EVENING

The evening sun intensifies the already vivid red light in
the kitchen the strange hue makes the plain omelette sat in

front of Eva resemble a slab of raw meat

She stares at it lost in thought then she takes a bite
Reaching up she pulls a piece of shell from her mouth

LATER

Eva pushes away her empty plate a neat ring of pieces of
eggshell round it’s rim drains her wine glass and reaches
for the bottle a line has been drawn halfway down the label
and she pours herself a neat glass careful not to go over the
half way mark

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Eva almost catatonic on the sofa Channel surfing

The Florida election debate is heating up and seems to be on
every station she isn’t remotely interested settles on
the Montel Show

OS A woman weeping and the audience booing swims in and out
as Eva dozes off

FADE TO BLACK

ON THE SOUND TRACK

KEVIN (0S)
They way I see it the world is
divided into the watchers and the
watcheesThere is more and more
of an audience and less and less to
see

Eva comes to her face lit up by the glow of the TV in the
darknesspale and confused she focuses on the screen with
increasing horror

KEVIN (0S)
People who actually do anything are
a goddamned endangered species You
need us
What would you do without me film
a documentary on paint drying What
are all those folks doing but
watching me Don’t you think they
would’ve changed the channel by now
if all I’d done is get an A in
Geometry

Eva mouth falls open
ON THE SCREEN we catch a brief glimpse of Kevin’s hands as

he tosses and rolls something between them casually while he
talks

The camera zooms to one corner of the bare cell a lone
photograph taped to the wall swims into focus

It’s Eva’s favorite picture the one that went missing
Young smiling and carefree in Amsterdam
The TV switches off abruptly

Eva swallows and straightens her shoulders preparing
herself

EXT CLAVERACK DETENTION CENTRE - DAY

Eva pushes a button on the wall outside the entrance an
electric buzzer sounds

She waits
OS The clanking of bolts

The door opens and a paunchy guard (AL late forties with a
smattering of raised brown facial moles) raises a hand

AL
Hey Eva

EVA
Hey Al

AL

EVA
I guess you could call it a special
occasion

Eva is led through a series of doors and corridors She’s
padded down and searched with a metal detector Eva knows the
routine and the guards all seem to know her

Eventually she’s shown into a waiting room by Al the door
closed behind her

She sits in the corner of the drab empty room

She yawns picks up a lone well thumbed copy of the National
Enquirer glances disinterestedly then tosses it back on the
table and sighs

The door creaks open an attractive young black woman pokes
her head timidly into the room Eva tries to raise a smile
for her but she seems anxious to avoid eye contact

She creeps in and takes a seat in the opposite corner
looking close to tears After fidgeting restlessly for a few
moments she gets up bending to pick up the solitary
magazine she glances up at Eva

WOMAN
May I

EVA
Go right ahead but there’s not
much in there

The woman manages a shy half smile and scurries back to her
chair Eva notices her hands are trembling slightly as she
struggles to turn the pages noiselessly

After a few moments she folds up the magazine and puts it
down casting her eyes around the room she notices the
vending machine standing in the corner

She inserts a few coins types in her selection A mechanical
whirring a packet of M and Ms is pushed forward it’s just
about to fall into the drawer below when the whirring stops
the candy hangs tentatively in the air it’s jammed - the
machine goes silent

This seems too much for her she rests her forehead against
the clear plastic and lets out a low moan

Suddenly Eva is at her side She bends down and gives the
vending machine a hearty whack with her fist the M and M’s
drop into the drawer and Eva fishes them out handing them to
the black woman with a smile

EVA (CONT’D)
Works every time just gotta hit
the right spot

The woman smiles shyly Eva finds herself holding her hand
their eyes lock strangely it’s Eva who’s eyes are filling
with tears

Loretta Greenleaf

The woman looks round

LORETTA
Take care honey

Another moment then she releases Eva’s hand and leaves with
the guard

INT VISITING ROOM - DAY

KEVIN (0S)
Hey Al you still got something on
your face

Kevin is led in Eva notices a change in his demeanor before
he says a word All that snide condescension and the swagger
have fallen away A couple of fresh scratches on his face
his knuckles grazed

He’s wearing an orange jumpsuit- it’s odd to see him wearing
something not only the normal size but too big for him He
looks dwarfed confused bereft

His eyes have shed their glaze and tunneled to the back of
his head

EVA
You don’t look happy

KEVIN
Have I ever

His tone is wan

KEVIN
I’m almost eighteen aren’t I

He rubs his face something in his manner shows a glimpse of
his father Eva winces
EVA
What is it going to big school
make you nervous

KEVIN
(incredulously)
‘Nervous’ Do you know anything
about those places

EVA
Well you did such a good job tried
as a minor out of your head on
prozac You’ll be out in a couple
of years

He shakes his head in dismay

EVA
You know I saw you on TV

KEVIN
Oh that

He squirms with a tinge of embarrassment

KEVIN
It was a while ago you know I was
into a a thing

He looks away from her

A pause

EVA
Well I’m not sure about the thing
but you sounded quite intelligent
now you only have to come up with
something to say that isn’t

KEVIN

(wryly)
Horseshit

EVA
You do know what day it is Why
they let me come and see you on a
Monday

KEVIN
Oh sure It’s my anniversary

EVA
That’s right two years plenty
of time to think about it

She leans forward in her chair slightly

EVA
Look me in the eye and tell me why

Kevin can’t look her in the eye his eyes shutter nervously
between the floor and the blank walls

KEVIN
(glumly )
I used to think I knew
Now I’m not so sure

Without thinking Eva extends her hand across the table and
clasps his Astonishingly he doesn’t pull away

EVA
Thank you

KEVIN
ListenI made you something A -
well sort of present

He draws a dark rectangular wooden box about five inches long
from his pocket polishes the oiled wood with the wad of
toilet paper it’s been wrapped in

Carefully he slides the box across the table keeping two
fingers on the top the workmanship is surprisingly fine

She reaches but he keeps his fingers on it fast

KEVIN
Don’tI mean whatever you do
Don’t open it

Eva instinctively shrinks back She flushes a little
shocked a little horrified

EVA
(in a stinging tone)
I see I thought that was one of
your most treasured possessions
Why ever would you give it up

KEVIN
It was like she was sort of
looking at me all the time It
started to get spooky

EVA
She is looking at you So is your
father every day

Kevin stares at the table he shoves the box a little further
towards Eva then removes his hand

KEVIN
Anyway I thought you might take
this and well maybe you know -

EVA
Bury it

Eva nods gravely and weighted by the enormity of the request
they spend the remaining minutes of the visit in a heavy
leaden silence until the guard calls time
Eva rises slowly followed by Kevin
As she moves to hug him goodbye he clings to her childishly
as he never had in childhood proper He mutters something
choked into the upturned collar of her coat’I’m sorry’
She’s not sure if she’s heard him right but she takes the
risk
EVA

I’m sorry too Kevin I’m sorry too
INT EVAS CAR - EARLY EVENING
Empty highway silence fills the car
Eva flicks on the radio
‘the Remington fuzz away’
Scrambling channels news talk shows ads
’an oldie but a goodie’

--Are you lonesome tonight Do you miss me tonight

Neon signs reflected in the windscreenTaco bell Staples
Wallmart swim over Eva’s face

Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day

A church sign a hand with a stop watch’Lord teach me how to
wait’

She pulls up outside the duplex Turns the engine off Sits
in the car

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare

Later inside

She sits on the couch dressed only in Franklin’s huge ancient
rock T-shirt Absentmindedly she pulls the material to her

face breathes in

Her purse half open sits waiting for her on the table the
box visible

A gulp of wine She looks at the bottle it’s down to the
halfway mark Fuck it fills her glass

Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there

Eva fuzzyputs her hand out to grip the bannister There
is no bannister

A door at the end of the hall the opposite end to Eva’s a
room we haven’t seen before a pause she pushes the door
open

Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again

A small cell like bedroom a neatly made single bed Not
much else sparse and impersonal

She places the little box on a bare shelf beside the only
book ‘ROBIN HOOD’

Tell me dear are you

She smooths down the bed covers stands in the doorway for a
moment

Lonesome tonight
Eva turns off the light leaving the empty room waiting

FADE TO BLACK

You know someone said that the
world’s a stage and each must play
a part

Fate had me playing in love with
you as my sweet heart

You read your lines so cleverly and
never missed a cue

Now the stage is bare and Im
standing there with emptiness all
around

And if you wont come back to me
then they can bring the curtain
down
