not dissuaded

INT BARBER SHOP - DAY

Shorty has his jacket and hat off his sleeves rolled up He is
surgeon preparing for an operation His equipment is spread out
a table can of lye large mason jar wooden stirring spoon
the eggs His actions have the character of a ritual each
being done just so in time-honored fashion

He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason

He adds water and makes a paste of the starch
Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation ONE MAN is
getting a haircut TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER JASON)

one of them from behind a newspaper A middle-aged barber
CHOLLY is doing most of the talking

CHOLLY
After I hit the number that woman wasnt no good
to me at all

The men laugh

ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye whiffs it Its good

and

strong He pours some in the mason jar stirring with the
wooden

spoon He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs He waits
as

fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot

ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door slightly
ajar A woolly head entirely in shadow peers out

CHOLLYS VOICE
She says Im cheap cuz I wont cop her a diamond
ring Had the indignation to call me a cheap
black sunovabitch to boot

TOOMER
And when a black woman call you a cheap black
sunovabitch youve been called a cheap black
sunovabitch

Cholly is annoyed Its his story

CHOLLY
Will you let me tell it

ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying

unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it Now he dons a
pair of

rubber gloves

SHORTY
Wheres Homeboy

He is all ready one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of

Vaseline His manner is indignant as if he were asking the
whereabouts

of an exasperating child

CHOLLY

TOOMER
You mean hiding in the head

CHOLLY
Hey Red Your mans here and waiting on you

His hands full Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM
comes

clothes

and an expression of apprehension

TOOMER

Homeboy

CHOLLY

Man dont scare him more than hes scared
already Aint too bad

Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair where
Cholly drapes

him with a double sheet tucking it tightly around his neck and
adding

a protective collar of paper

CHOLLY
Like anything else First time a chick gets her
cherry popped she might put up a little fight But
pretty soon you cant give her enough Right
Homeboy

CLOSE - MALCOLM
Malcolm gulps his eyes on the fuming mason jar

Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into
Malcolms

scalp covering his neck and ears as well All the men have
gathered

around involved in the ritual For Malcolm it is closer to
being a

kind of execution

CHOLLY
Git his forehead and eyebrows

SHORTY
I know what Im doing
Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area Now he brings over
the
steaming jar and places it nearby

SHORTY
Listen You pull my coat if its still stinging
when I get through cause this shit can burn a
hole through cement

CHOLLY
Hold tight baby and keep your eyes shut

Malcolm nods his head clenches his eyes and grits his teeth
Shorty
applies the congolene with a comb working it into Malcolms

hair
CLOSE - MALCOLM
MALCOLM
I thought you said it was gonna sting this
aint nothin’
For a moment nothing happens then the heat hits him He yells
tries

to catch his breath his head is on fire

MALCOLM
You motherfucker Youre killing me Im
burning up My damn head is on fire

He nearly leaps out of the chair but the barber restrains him

Shorty utterly unmoved by the outburst continues working the
congolene into his hair

Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly But the three men drag
him to a

basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray His cries
filling the

room Malcolm is ducked under the spray Shorty starts rinsing
out his

hair

SHORTY
Dont fight me man Let me git it out

Malcolm is a little relieved he tentatively opens his eyes
then he

feels the congolene again and there is another outburst Shorty
forces
his head under the spray spurts the water all over his head

wetting

up to him

with great respect

PETE

109 INT SHOWER ROOM - DAY

Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over
his

broken body He lets it run and run but it cannot really touch
his

problems On a nearby bench are his clothes his towel and the
makings

for a conk lye Vaseline comb etc

He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by
someone Its

Bembry standing nearby Malcolm turns away trying to find
solace in

the water He wants no part of the world or anyone just to be

left
alone
BEMBRY
I know how you feel Like you want to lay down
and die
Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding
BEMBRY
I brought you something
He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolms
things
Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced
him to
deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than
angry

MALCOLM
Who the hell are you

BEMBRY
Put it in a cup of water Its nutmeg
MALCOLM
Man what do you want

BEMBRY

You need something Its not a reefer but
itll help some

MALCOLM
Man get outa my face I aint nobodys punk

But he steps out of the shower fills a tin cup with water and
empties

the contents of the matchbox into it And drinks it down
quickly

BEMBRY
Sit down or it might knock you down

Malcolm sits toweling himself as the spice hits him For the
first he

smiles this is the first relief he has tasted in prison He at
Bembry

wonderingly unable to figure him out

MALCOLM
f you aint trying to punk me whats your
hype
BEMBRY

can show you how to get out of prison And
its no hype

MALCOLM
Talk daddy Im listening Hey that aint bad
You got some more

BEMBRY
Thats the last stuff youll ever get from me

fq

MALCOLM
What did you give it to me for then

BEMBRY

Cause you needed it Cause you couldnt hear
me without it

This is a new breed of cat Malcolm has never met anyone like
him He
eyes him closely as he slips into his clothes

MALCOLM
What in the hell are you talking about

He begins to conk his hair but is paying attention to what
Bembry is
saying

BEMBRY
I think you got more sense than any cat in this
prison How come you are such a fool

Malcolm looks over piqued

BEMBRY
Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it in the
movies Because even if you get out you are
still in prison

Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now

MALCOLM
You aint lying

BEMBRY
When you go busting your fists against a stone
wall youre not using your brains Cause
thats what the white man wants you to do Look
at you

These last words are spoken sharply with disgust Malcolm turns
his
hands massaging the conk into his hair

BEMBRY
Putting all that poison in your hair

MALCOLM
Man you been locked up too long everybody
conks All the cats

BEMBRY
Why Why does everybody conk

MALCOLM
Cause I dont want to walk around with my head
all nappy looking like--

BEMBRY
Like what Looking like me Like a nigger
Why dont you want to look like what you are
What makes you ashamed of being black

MALCOLM
I aint said Im ashamed

He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun
to burn
Bembry restrains him holding his arm

MALCOLM
Leggo I got to wash it out

BEMBRY
Let it burn Maybe youll hear me then

But it is burning now

MALCOLM
Man you better get off me

He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water

BEMBRY
Sure burn yourself pain yourself put all
that poison into your hair into your body --
trying to be white

MALCOLM
Man I dont want to hear all that

BEMBRY
I thought you was smart But you just another
one of them cats strutting down the avenue in
your clown suit with all that mess on you Like
a monkey And the white man sees you and he
laughs He laughs because he knows you aint
white

Malcolm is drying his hair finishing his conk But some of
what Bembry
has said disturbs him

MALCOLM
Who are you

Malcolm is completely humiliated Bembry sees this and stops
the
barrage

BEMBRY
The question is who are you You are in the
darkness but its not your fault Elijah
Muhammad can bring you into the light

MALCOLM
Elijah who

BEMBRY
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison Out
of the prison of your mind Maybe all you want
is another fix I thought you were smart

And he is gone Malcolm stands looking after him a long
thoughtful
moment He is pulling the comb through his hair

ELIJAH
Here is a glass dirty and its water foul If
you offer it to the people and they have no
choice they must drink out of it But if you
present them with this glass--

He is holding a clean glass with clear water in it

ELIJAH

choose the pure vessel Islam is the only
religion which addresses the needs and problems
of the so-called Negro especially in the
ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs
crime unemployment prostitution alcohol
gambling fornication and adultery

Elijah holds up the clear glass

VOICE OF MALCOLM X
This sweet gentle man gave me the truth from
his own mouth And I adored him in the sense
of the Latin root of the word Adorare to

ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of
a gun but the fear one has of the power of the
sun I pledged myself to him even if it cost

me my life

miserable living conditions that exist in our
community the black masses that are sick of
the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced
by these semi-savage white policemen that
patrol our community like the occupation
forces of a conquering enemy army the black

MALCOLMHIS VOICE
The white people who are guilty of white
supremacy try and hide their own guilt by
accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of
teaching black supremacy when he tries to
uplift the mentality the social and economic
condition of black people in this country And
the Jews who have been guilty of exploiting
the black people economically civilly and
otherwise hide their guilt by accusing the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic
simply because he teaches our people to go into
business for ourselves and trying to take over
the economic leadership in our own community
The black people in this country have been the
victims of violence at the hands of the white
man for 400 years and following the ignorant
Negro preachers we have thought that it was
God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute

that was brutalizing us 100 years ago they

use to put on a white sheet and use a
bloodhound against Negroes Today theyve taken
off sheets and put on police uniforms theyve
traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs And
just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to
keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds
or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them
to love their enemy or pray for those who use
them as spitefully today The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is showing black people that just as
the white man and every other person on this
earth has God given rights natural rights
civil rights and any other kind of rights that
you can think of when it comes to defending
himself

the

podium Lorraine Sidney Earl Benjamin and Bembry For the
first

time a new note is seen in Bembrys face reserve bordering on

resentment When others around him cheer Malcolm Bembry is
cool

Sidney notices this from his father but makes no comment

MALCOLMHIS VOICE
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that
God is now about to establish a kingdom on this
earth based on brotherhood and

against peace his history on this earth has
proved that Nowhere in history has he been
brotherly toward anyone The only time he has
been brotherly toward you is when he can use
you when he can exploit you when he can
oppress you when you will submit to him And
since his own history makes him unqualified to
be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of
brotherhood the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that God is about to eliminate that
particular race from this earth So since they
are due for elimination we dont want to be
with them

ANGLE - CROWD
CLOSE - MALCOLM

MALCOLM
If the so-called Negro were American citizens
we wouldnt have a race problem If the
Emancipation Proclamation was authentic you
wouldnt have a race problem If the 13th
14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution
was authentic you wouldnt have a race
problem If the Supreme Court desegregation
decision was authentic you wouldnt have a
race problem All of this is hypocrisy These
Negro leaders have been telling the white man
everything is all right everything is under
control And theyve been telling the white man
that Mr Muhammad is wrong dont listen to
him But everything Mr Muhammad has been
saying is going to come to pass is now coming
to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing
up saying that we are about to have a racial
explosion Were going to have a racial
explosion and thats more dangerous than an
atomic explosion

ANGLE - MALCOLM

MALCOLM
Its going to explode because black people are
dissatisfied Theyre dissatisfied now not only
with the white man but with these Negroes who
have been sitting around here posing as leaders
and spokesmen for black people Anytime you put
too many sparks around a powder keg the thing
is going to explode and if the thing that
explodes is still inside the house then the
house will be destroyed So the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get
this powder keg out of your house let the
black people in this country separate from him
while theres still time And if the black man
is allowed to separate and go on onto some land
of his own where he can solve his problems
then there wont be any explosion COMPLETE
SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK
AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY

Malcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a
roomful

of SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS

MALCOLM
Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive
year on the racial front and because I myself
intend to be very active in every phase of the
American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS I
have called this press conference this
morning in order to clarify my own position in
the struggle -- especially in regards to
politics and nonviolence In the past I thought
the thoughts spoke the words of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad that day is over From now on

I speak my own words and think my own thoughts

Internal differences within the Nation of Islam
forced me out of it I did not leave of my own
free will But now that it has happened I
intend to make the most of it Now that I have
more independence of action I intend to use a
more flexible approach toward working with
others to get a solution to this problem I do
not pretend to be a divine man but I do
believe in divine guidance divine power and
in the fulfillment of divine prophecy I am not
educated nor am I an expert in any particular
field but I am sincere and my sincerity is my
credentials Im not out to fight other Negro
leaders or organizations We must find a common
solution to a common problem I am going to
organize and head a new mosque in New York
City known as the Muslim Mosque Inc This
gives us a religious base and the spiritual
force necessary to rid our people of the vices

that destroy the moral fiber of our community
Our political philosophy will be black
nationalism Our economic and social philosophy
will be black nationalism The Muslim Mosque
Inc will remain wide open for ideas and
financial aid from all quarters Whites can
help us but they cant join us There can be
no black-white unity until there is first some
black unity

A host of questions fired all at once How many of Elijahs
followers
will join you etc etc etc

Malcolm calms them

MALCOLM
There is one further preparation I need It is
a return to the source of our great religion I
will make a pilgrimage to Mecca

MALCOLMS VOICE
You may be shocked by these words but I have
eaten from the same plate drunk from the same
glass and prayed to the same God with fellow
Muslims whose eyes were blue whose hair was

And we are brothers truly people of all
colors and races believing in One God and one
humanity Once before in prison the truth
came and blinded me It has happened again

MALCOLMS VOICE
In the past I have permitted myself to be used
to make sweeping indictments of all white
people and these generalizations have caused
injuries to some white folks who did not
deserve them Because of the spiritual rebirth
which I was blessed to undergo as a result of
my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca I no
longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of
one race I intend to be careful not to
sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty
Im not a racist and do not subscribe to any of
the tenets of racism In all honesty and
sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing
but freedom justice and equality life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all
people

A TIGHT TWO-SHOT of Malcolm and Betty in an embrace She breaks
from
him and whispers Go ahead I can wait now

181 INT JFK AIRPORT - DAY

A large PRESS CONFERENCE mikes of every network every
newspaper and
wire service present Malcolm sports a beard

MALCOLM
Lets begin

REPORTER 1
Malcolm you said on your trip abroad you
sensed a feeling of great brotherhood

MALCOLM
As I recall I pointed out that while I was in
Mecca making the pilgrimage I spoke about the
brotherhood that existed at all levels among
all people all colors who had accepted the
religion of Islam I pointed out that what it
had done Islam for those people despite their
complexion differences that it would probably
do America well to study the religion of Islam
and perhaps it could drive some of the racism
from this society Muslims look upon themselves
as human beings as part of the human family
and therefore look upon all other segments of

the human family as part of that same family

Today my friends are black brown red yellow
and white

REPORTER 8
Malcolm are you prepared to go to the United
Nations at this point and ask that charges be
brought against the United States for its
treatment of the American Negroes

MALCOLM
Oh yes

The AUDIENCE applauds

MALCOLM
The audience will have to be quiet Yes as I
pointed out that during my trip that nations
African nations Asian Latin nations look very
hypocritical when they stand up in the UN
condemning South Africa and saying nothing
about the racist practices that are manifested
everyday against Negroes in this society I
would be not a man if I didnt do so I
wouldnt be a man

REPORTER 3
Are you prepared to work with some of the
leaders of some of the other civil rights
organizations

MALCOLM
Certainly we will work with any groups
organizations or leaders in any way as long as
its genuinely designed to get results

REPORTER 1
Does the new beard have any religious
significance

MALCOLM
No not particularly But I do think that you
will And black people in America as they
strive to throw off the shackles of mental
colonialism will also probably reflect an
effort to throw off the shackles of cultural
colonialism And then theyll begin to reflect
desires of their own with standards of their
own

REPORTER 2
One of your more controversial remarks was a

call for black people to get rifles and form

rifle clubs sometime back Do you still favor
that for self-defense

MALCOLM
I dont see why that should be controversial I
think that if white people found themselves
victim of the same kind of brutality that black
people in this country face and they saw that
the government was either unwilling or unable
to protect them that the intelligence on the
part of the whites would make them get some
rifles and protect themselves

REPORTER 2
What about the guns Malcolm

MALCOLM
Has the white man changed since I went away
Have you put up your guns The day you stop
being violent against my people will be the
day I tell folks to put away their guns

REPORTER 3

brightest hopes extinguished now and gone from
us forever

parlor
waiting to see Malcolms body where it lies before burial

OSSIE DAVISS VOICE
For Harlem is where he worked and where he
struggled and fought His home of homes where
his heart was and where his people are And it
is therefore most fitting that we meet once
again in Harlem to share these last moments
with him For Harlem has ever been gracious to
those who loved her have fought for her and
defended her honor even to death It is not in
the memory of man that this beleaguered
unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has
found a braver more gallant young champion
than this Afro-American who lies before us
unconquered still Many will ask what Harlem
finds to honor in this stormy controversial
and bold young captain and we will smile and we
will answer and say unto them
