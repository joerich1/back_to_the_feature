A Hot Tub in Vegas

DISSOLVE TO
INT FANTASY SUITE CAESARS PALACE - NIGHT

Well get to the hot tub in a second The first thing we need
to know is that theres a large television nearby thats on
but that no ones paying attention to At the moment its
showing a commercial for a shampoo called Gee Your Hair
Smelis Terrific Men are passing women on the street and
telling them that Gee your hair smells terrific

We dont care ‘cause the rest of the room is populated with
hot women wholl be having sex with strangers tonight The
sound of the shampoo commercial is easily overtaken by The
Fine Young Cannibals Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows we
can see the lights of the Strip and a couple of room service
WAITERS are wheeling in another table of booze ice and
glasses

In the large jacuzzi are PAUL BROWN 40 and wants to be
younger LIZ WICKERSHAM a recent Playboy cover model two
STRIPPERS who may or may not be wearing any clothes right now
and our star CHARLIE WILSON

Joints make their way around the room as do small mirrors

with lines

PAUL BROWN isnt a real player and CHARLIE knows it but he11
do his best to humor the guy for LIZs sake

BROWN
Itd be like Dallas

LIZ
Thats xight

BROWN
Yeah

CHARLIE
Tell me when to watch Ill make sure Im
home

BROWN
You dont think I can make it happen
CHARLIE
I dont know anything about how any of
that works
BROWN
I do
LIZ
(to CHARLIE)

You said youd listen to him thats why
were here

CHARLIE
Do they routinely give starring roles on
network programs to people whove never
acted professionally before

BROWN
She was just on the fucking cover of
Playboy

CHARLIE

I guess that’s the same thing

LIZ
Would you take this seriously please
Will you hear the whole pitch and take it
seriously

CHARLIE
I do take it seriously honey but can I
ask yall somethin’ What the fuck is Dan
Rather wearing right now

LIZ
What

CHARLIE
Dan Rather

4

CHARLIE’s talking about the TV which no longer has a shampoo
® commercial on it but instead that nights edition of 60

Minutes DAN RATHERs delivering a report from Afghanistan and
hes dressed in traditional Afghan tribal clothing

LIZ
Youre watching TV

CHARLIE
And he hasnt shaved
LIZ
Who gives a damn
CHARLIE
(calling to a guy near the TV)
Excuse me could you turn that up
LIZ
You said you were gonna take this meeting
seriously
CHARLIE

I am
(to the GUY)
Excuse me

® The GUY looks at CHARLIE

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Would you mind turning up the volume on
the TV

GUY
Im completely high

CHARLIE
Okay well still if you could just grab
that remote there should be a button
that says--Nope you turned it off That
was the power button

BROWN
Charlie are we gonna do business

CHARLIE
Dan Rathers wearing a turban you dont
want to know why

LIZ
It was a thing from India

CHARLIE
Afghanistan

to the GUY)
There you go youre on it Now the
volume

GUY
Got it

CHARLIE
Preciate it

Were watching and listening to snatches of the 60 Minutes
report--

DAN RATHER
(from TV)
Does he have ammunition for this He has
three-but does he have ammunition A lot
ammunition

CHARLIE
Hes talking about the Mujahideen

BROWN
Priests

CHARLIE

Mujahideen means freedom fighters
(beat)
Priests

BROWN
How the hell am I supposed to know

CHARLIE
These guys are fighting the Red Amy with
sticks and stones

Well stay on CHARLIE and the TV while we HEAR LIZ and BROWN
in the background

LIZ

(to BROWN)
Do you think that instead of my money
coming from my father that I should be a
widow That I was married to a Washington
power broker who gets killed in an
accident and that that’s where I have my
money from and not my father Or would
that make me seem old

BROWN
Thats interesting let me think on that
for a second

DAN RATHER
(on TV)
Is he worried about these helicopters
back here I hear that bombing sound in
the background

CHARLIE
(to the TV)
Yes Danny hes worried

LIZ
to BROWN)
You know what I mean When I say widow

BROWN
That your husband died

LIZ
Yeah

AFGHAN FIGHTER
(from TV)

Without arms and ammunition you cannot

fight And no country is providing arms

to Mujahideen

BROWN
You think it would make you seem old
LIZ
Possibly
BROWN
Because——
LIZ

Because I was already married to someone
who you know was now dead

BROWN
But if hes killed--

LIZ
Thats right--

BROWN
In a car crash--

And now one of the two STRIPPERS in the hot tub speaks up-

LIZ
Im an idiot

TRANSLATOR
(from TV)
America seems to be asleep It doesnt
seem to realize that if Afghanistan goes--
and the Russians go over the Gulf--that
in a very short time its going to be the
turn of the United States as well

CHARLIE
Thats a pretty gloomy fucking way to
look at it

STRIPPER
Excuse me

CHARLIE

STRIPPER

Living

colleagues that liberal democrats show up
for this vote and this colleague is
important to me cause hes gonna put a
half-million dollar Paper Industry
International Hall of Fame in Appleton

CHARLIE

I guess theyre pretty nostalgic about

it
SAPPHIRE

What are they gonna have in it
CHARLIE

I really dont know

(to LIZ)

(MORE)

CHARLIE (CONTD)

But what I get is authorizing language
stricken from a pilot program in Denver
that would prohibit discussing birth
control in health education classes and
once I do that I can get the liberals and
the women to sign a non-binding
resolution declaring pretty much
anything

KELLY
Awesome

as Charlies Angels--the tall beautiful young women who make
up his support staff In their defense they seem very
efficient

Waiting in a waiting area are LARRY LIDDLE early 60s and
his daughter JANE late 20s LARRY has the well-scrubbed
look of a man who plays golf at a nice club but used to do
muscle work His daughter JANE--despite the fact that she
doesnt flaunt her sexuality in front of her father--is
clearly very attractive She wears a business suit--jacket and
skirt--and keeps her mouth shut

After a moment

CHARLIE
Coffee juice--
LIDDLE

CHARLIE

LIDDLE
Charlie--

CHARLIE
This situation with the creche Tell me
about it

LARRY
Every single year since the world was
young a firehouse in the Township of
Nacogdoches has displayed a creche at
Christmas time Now the ACLU has filed
suit against the Township for displaying
a religious symbol on public property
Its Christmas time its a creche I
could understand if we were in fucking
Scarsdale but this is east Texas and I
want to know who were offending except
two lawyers from the ACLU

CHARLIE
Thats a terribly interesting and
complicated question Let me suggest this
though A block and a half from the
firehouse is a church First Baptist
Church of Nacogdoches and theyve got a
beautiful rolling lawn in front and you
can pick that creche up and put it on
church property and everybody goes home
happy

LIDDLE
Theres a larger point here

CHARLIE
I was afraid of that

LIDDLE
The is a Christian country Charlie
founded on Christian values and beliefs
We welcome other faiths to worship as
they wish but when you cant put a
nativity scene in front of a firehouse at
Christmas time in Nacogdoches Township
somethings gone terribly wrong

CHARLIE
Well not really Larry cause you can
move the creche to the church and
everythings fine

LIDDLE
Thats not the point

-—————— wll

2)

CHARLIE
Help me with the point

LIDDLE
I broke ground this morning on a Dairy
Queen in Crockett thats my sixth in
your district and it makes me the largest
franchiser in the South Charlie now
lemme tell you somethin My stores are
open from 6am to 10pm and we dont just
serve cakes and cones we serve burgers
shakes and hot dogs

CHARLIE
This is related to a Nativity scene in
Nacogdoches how

LIDDLE

Im saying my stores are part of the
community Police offices eat there and
so do teenagers My employees and my
customers find that creche inspirational
and no one has received one damn
complaint so I ask you again whose
rights are the ACLU fightin for

CHARLIE
I dont know but theres like nine
churches within a six block area of that
firehouse you could always move the
creche to one of them and--

LIDDLE
Thats not the point

CHARLIE
Okay what can I do for you

LIDDLE
You cam intervene in the case against the
Creche Committee

CHARLIE
How

LIDDLE
You appointed the judge Pilner

CHARLIE

I dont appoint judges I made a
recommendation to President Reagan

BONNIE enters with a note that shell show CHARLIE--

LIDDLE
Well I think--

CHARLIE
Excuse me President Carter

LIDDLE
I think you and I both know what that

means and--

CHARLIE

do

The note says Jim Van Wagenen--

LIDDLE
Why

laws Excuse me one second while I see a

A Rogue Elephant in the Agency Woods
INT GRAVERS OFFICE - DAY

GRAVER is the Director of European Operations for the CIA but
its not important that we know that just yet One wall of his
office is glass which looks out onto a large bullpen of
support staff

At the moment a MAINTENANCE WORKER is putting the finishing
touches on a replacement pane of glass

Sitting across the desk from GRAVER is GUST AVRAKOTOS GUSTs
appearance-slightly rumpled jacket and tie tinted glasses
shoes that have been worn too much--suggests that hes a
wholesale liquor distributer rather than what he really is
which is a 20 year veteran of Americas intelligence gathering
and covert services One of the Agencys most well connected
spies

GRAVER
Okay Well It was hard for you to come
in with your hat in your hand thats not
the kind of--the kind of upbringing I
guess is the word Im looking for--its
not the kind of man you are and I
understand that I have no interest in
humiliating you or exacting a price Why
dont you just apologize well say its
water under the dam and well go about
our business

GUST
(pause)
Excuse me what the fuck

GRAVER
(beat)
What

GUST
Excuse me

GRAVER
For Helsinki I need someone with
diplomatic skills and you dont have
them

GUST
Is that right

GRAVER
Thats right

GUST
And the 3000 agents Turner fired Was
that because they lacked diplomatic
skills as well

GRAVER
Youre referring to Admiral Turner

GUST
3000 agents Each and every goddam one of
‘em first or second generation Americans
Did they lack the proper diplomatic
skills or did Turner not think it was a
good idea te have spies who could speak
the same language as the people we were
spying on

GRAVER
(almost laughing)
You can hardly blame the Director for
questioning the loyalty to America of
people whe are just barely Americans

GUST
Well now Id like to take a moment to
review the several ways in which youre a
douche bag

GRAVER
Get out of my office before I end your

GUST steps out into--

INT BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

--where he immediately sees the MAINTENANCE MAN nearby and
says--

Gust

back and whips the butt against the new window pane
shattering it to the ground

GRAVER
Shit goddamit

GUST

GUST returns the gun to the small of his back He winks at a
SECRETARY who smiles a little back at him Then--

I wasnt aware that the Soviet Union has
taken Afghanistan

JOANNE

Yes I believe my government is aware but
I was wondering what they were thinking
ef doing about it other than boycotting
the Olympics which I think youll agree
was a fairly impotent response to the
greatest national security threat weve
faced since the Cuban Missile Crisis

CHARLIE
Well I dont think making more movies is
gonna do the trick either if thats what
youre asking

JOANNE
Its not What Im asking is is exactly
how much power do you have as a member of

JOANNE
Theyre arming them with 127 mm Dish-K
machine guns which would be good except
the Soviets have specifically armor-
plated their Hind helicopters to resist a
127 mm shell We sold Pakistan the F-
16s but refused to equip them with “look
down shoot down radar Why wont the
US give Pakistans pilots the same
equipment were giving the Israelis If
this were a real war State would issue a
White Paper outlining the Communist
threat the way they did in El Salvador
If this were a real war thered be a
National Bipartisan Commission on
Afghanistan headed by Henry Kissinger the
way there is for Central America If this
were a real war Congress would authorize
24 million for covert operations like
youre doing in Nicaragua and if this
were a real war the NSC would
dramatically increase the strength of the
Mujahideen through direct training and
weapons

CHARLIE
What is it you want me to do Jo

JOANNE
I want you to save Afghanistan for the
Afghans deliver such a crushing defeat
to the Soviets that communism crumbles
and in so doing end the Cold War

slaughtering the Palestinians

CHARLIE
This was supposed to be a surgical strike

(pause)
Tt may seem righteous to you to me it
just seems childlike

2VI takes a drink and a drag off his cigarette

CHARLIE
Youre supposed to be the good guys I
dont think thats childlike

ZVI
Thats because you have friendly
neighbors to the north and south and
oceans to the east and west You have one
enemy and you keep an eye on him from
outer space Youd see the world
differently if your country was smaller
your people were hated and your borders
surrounded If some of our enemies want
to kill some of our other enemies I say
its one less headache for us I dont
lose much sleep over dead Palestinians
And if you lived in my neighborhood for a
week you wouldn’t either

Im going to see the President of
Pakistan tomorrow Its a courtesy
meeting arranged by one of my

word means The US is not eager to
assist us

CHARLIE
Its my understanding that we offered to
sell you F-16s and you didnt want them

2TA
Because you refused to sell us the radar

RASHID
So fuck that

ZIA
And this is emblematic of American fence-
sitting when it comes to fighting the
Soviets

RASHID
So fuck it

ZIA
You sell us the planes but not the radar
You offer Afghans rifles from the first
World War and Soviet gunships are killing
everything they can find-people
animals food supplies--

MAHMOOD
Fuck it

CHARLIE
Yes

RASHID

You sell the Israelis the radar So
thats why he says fuck it

CHARLIE
Again I understood Listen Mr
President Mr Mahmood Mr Rashid--Im
in a little over my head here Ima
congressman from Lufkin Texas I dont
even have seniority I have a hunch
Joanne may have dramatically overstated
my power when it comes touh ending
Communism I have a seat on a sub-
committee that--look Im sure the CIA is
working on a solution both in terms of
arms and money My chairman--

2IA

The arms and funding should flow through
us

CHARLIE
Im sorry

ZIA
Thats been part of the problem The arms
and the funding should flow through us
We have experience with warfare of this
kind and your CIA has an unimpressive
track record

CHARLIE
I wouldnt say that

Z2IA
They missed 35000 Russian soldiers
walking into Afghanistan

CHARLIE
Well I dont want to use up any more of
your hospitality so I’11 take your
message back to--

ZIA
Let mé walk you to the door

CHARLIE
Yes sir

ZIA takes CHARLIE to the door and stops him there to speak
privately

ZIA
Youre a man of many character flaws

CHARLIE
(pause)
Thank you

ZIA
I mean I learned about you before you
came here And I learned that youre a
man of many character flaws

CHARLIE

ZIA
But I learned that you never promise
anything you cant deliver Will you
promise one thing to me

CHARLIE
Whats that Mr President

4Ia
Will you go to the Khyber Pass Right now
today Will you go to the Khyber Pass and
see with your eyes whats happening here

CHARLIE
(pause)
I’ll arrange it through the embassy

ZIA
Thank you Mr Congressman

CHARLIE
Thank you Mr President

The door is opened for CHARLIE and he steps out into-
INT CORRIDOR CONTINUOUS

-where the STEWARD accompanies him and the waiting BONNIE
back down the hall

BONNIE
How did it go

CHARLIE
There were three of them It was like
getting slapped around by a Pakistani
vaudeville team You know youve pretty
much hit rock bottom when youve been
told you have character flaws by a man
who hanged his predecessor in a military

coup
BONNIE

Can we go home now
CHARLIE

No We have to make another stop
BONNIE

Where
CHARLIE

The Khyber Pass

BONNIE
Why

CHARLIE
Because I said so

As CHARLIE and BONNIE continue down the hall we HEAR the
sound of low flying helicopters and then the VOICE of a young
AFGHAN BOY speaking in Arabic—-

AFGHAN BOY
(in Arabic)
I was walking to the well to get water

cur TO

EXT REFUGEE CAMPHOSPITAL

Its a beautiful vista with the Khyber Pass in the
background Unfortunately in the foreground is a huge city of
tents and mud huts interrupted only by large MASH-like
hospital tents where its standing room only

TRANSLATOR (VO)
I was walking to the well to get water

The AFGHAN BOYs voice over as well as that of the TRANSLATOR
continue as CHARLIE and BONNIE step out of a truck that was

part of a three-truck military motorcade BONNIE and CHARLIE

are accompanied by both MILITARY and CIVILIAN GUIDES

AFGHAN BOY (VO)
(in Arabic)
I saw something shiny on the ground and
it looked like a toy

TRANSLATOR (VO)
I saw something shiny on the ground and
it locked like a toy

AFGHAN BOY (VO)
t reached down to grab it and when I did
it exploded in my hand

TRANSLATOR (VO)
I reached down to grab it and when I did
it exploded it my hand

AFGHAN BOY (VO)
I shouldve known Because only a few
weeks ago my five year old sister picked
up a piece of candy--

TRANSLATOR (VO)
I shouldve known Because only a few
weeks ago my five year old sister picked
up a piece of candy-—

AFGHAN BOY (VO)
--and it split her in two

TRANSLATOR (VO)
--and it split her in two

And with that they walk into--
INT HOSPITAL — CONTINUOUS

As bad as youd expect VOICES begin to DISSOLVE into one
another as we see CHARLIE taking in whats around him
particularly the faces of YOUNG BOYS each of whom is able to
bravely and casually meet CHARLIEs stare

As CHARLIE and the group are walked slowly through the
hospital tent we continue to HEAR the VOICES of WITNESSES
spoken through a TRANSLATOR

AFGHAN MAN (VO)
(in Arabic)
Something was shaking our houses

TRANSLATOR (VO)
He says something was shaking their
houses

AFGHAN MAN (VO)
(in Arabic)
We ran outside to see what it was

TRANSLATOR (VO)
We ran outside to see what it was

AFGHAN MAN (VO)
(in Arabic)
It was the rotors from the helicopters

TRANSLATOR (VO)
It was the rotors from the helicopters

AFGHAN MAN (VO)

And when we ran outside thats when they
opened fire

TRANSLATOR (VO)
And when we ran outside thats when they
opened fire

AFGHAN DOCTOR (VO)
(not needing translation)
They took 40 villagers And as an example
to the others they tied them up and
piled them like wood Then poured
gasoline over them and--

The group walks out of a flap in the tent and into--

EXT TENT CITY - CONTINUOUS

--and they begin surveying the nightmare as the VOICES
continue dissolving into one another

REFUGEE (VO)
(not needing translation)
--about 350 people in three small
villages near Kandahar But instead of
doing it all at once they would make the
parents watch as they slit the throats of
their children

REFUGEE 2 (VO)
(in Arabic)
They took 14 of us and lined us up
against the wali--

TRANSLATOR (VO)
They took 14 of us and lined us up
against the wall-—-

REFUGEE WOMAN (VO)
(not needing translation)
--after we started reciting The Holy
Kalima from the Holy Quran we--

TRANSLATOR (VO)
--raping women stabbing the pregnant
ones with knives-

REFUGEE 3 (VO)
--the Russians poured a substance on the
live bodies which caused instant
decomposition

At this point CHARLIE is standing away from the group and
staring out at the Khyber Pass off in the distance an opening
in the mountains where for centuries Afghans have been able to
see invading forces come into their country

A REFUGEE WOMAN from a long distance away begins running
toward CHARLIE and screaming CHARLIE lost in his thoughts
doesnt even hear or notice the WOMAN until shes practically
on top of him

Shes grabbing at him and screaming which startled him at
first But almost as soon as this happens AFGHAN MEN have run
over dragged her off and thrown her to the ground

CHARLIE
(shouting)
Its all right Im fine ‘She didnt--she
didnt do anything it’s all right
(to the TRANSLATOR)
What was she saying to me

TRANSLATOR
You have to kill the Godless ones Why
wont you kill the Godless ones”

CHARLIE
(shouting to the MEN who are
shouting at the WOMAN)
Its all right

TRANSLATOR
(explaining)
She shouldnt have touched a man with her
hands

CHARLIE walks away from the shouting to get some space BONNIE
comes over-

BONNIE
Youre all right

CHARLIE
Yeah Im all--yeah Listen do something
for me I want to go back to the city I
want to see the CIA Station Chief in
Islamabad

BONNIE
Yes sir

INT AMERICAN EMBASSY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Committee I have a plane waiting on a

hiding that as he works the combination to a lock on a door
He opens it and he and CHARLIE walk into--

INT BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

specially armor plated to resist--

CHARLIE
Yeah I know So you tell me what you

HART
Do you want this briefing

CHARLIE
Do you understand that Im saying tell me
what you need and I will go about getting
it for you

HART
I appreciate your generosity
Congressman but a sudden influx of money
and modern weaponry would draw attention

CHARLIE
(beat)

itwhat
HART

A sudden influx of--
CHARLIE

It would attract attention
HART

Yes
CHARLIE

I dont even understand what that--this

is the Cold War everybody knows about

Its a C-130 military transport plane which can hold about

300 people but which is virtually empty tonight Just

CHARLIE

BONNIE and maybe 20 other people in the whole cabin Several —
and

miniature liquor bottles sit in front of both CHARLIE
BONNIE as well as whats left of a salad or sandwich

turns and looks at BONNIE sitting next to him BONNIE
locks back at him

BONNTE
(pause)
Are you having a mid-life crisis thats -
starting now that’s starting right this
second on the airplane

CHARLIE
I had a neighbor growing up with a name
right out of Charles Dickens Mr Hazard
And Mr Hazard didnt like the
neighborhood dogs messing up his flower
bed And one day I heard a whole crowd
screaming next door so I ran over to Mr
Hazards About 15 people were standing
around my dog Teddy who was writhing on
the ground in very obvious agony Blood
was pouring out of his mouth My mother
was there too and she wouldnt let me go
near the dog cause she was afraid he was
rabid Mr Hazard had ground up some
glass and put it in a bowl of dog food
and fed it to hin

BONNIE
What did you do

Then he
just

74

CHARLIE

® I burned his flower bed down But that
wasnt satisfying enough And I
remembered that Mr Hazard was an elected
official he was head of the Town Council
and his re-election every two years was a
foregone conclusion So on Election Day
I drove over to the black section of
town which had never voted in these
elections I was only 13 but I had a
farmers license and I drove over and
filled my car with voters drove ‘em to
the polling place waited and then drove
‘em home And before they got out of the
car to vote Id say I think you should
know that Mr Hazard poisoned my dog”
400 people voted in that election I
drove a 96 of them to the polls Hazard
ljost by 16 votes I knocked on his door
and I said that Your black constituents
have just voted you out of office Dont
kill anymore dogs And thats how I fell
in love with America

(beat)

(

JAILBAIT
(reading)
Representative Charles Wilson has
learned he is joining several members of
Congress who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task force--

BONNTE
Dont say task force it sounds too
important it sounds like Elliot Ness is
running the thing

CHARLIE
Who is running the thing whos the
prosecutor
SUZANNE
Rudolph Giuliani From the Southern
District
BONNIE
You know him
CHARLIE
No
SUZANNE

And its been going on forever we should
say that

JAILBAIT
“Representative Charles Wilson has
earned he is joining several members of
Congress who are under investigation by
the Justice Department in what is now an
18th month long wide-ranging examination
that has resulted in no convictions

BONNIE

Afghan freedom fighter gets captured he
cant get captured with an American-made
weapon on him ‘cause thats how a cold
war turns into an actual war and thats
something you want to keep a good eye on
Can I smoke

CHARLIE

Gust
We have to azmm the Muj with weapons it

captured themselves

Yeah
(beat--quieter)
Listen Charlie

CHARLIE
What good does two or three do

GUST
(beat)
The limo driver

CHARLIE
Why not buy fifty
(beat)
What

GUST
You took a limo from Caesars to the
airport Its easy enough to track down
the driver and hand him a subpoena and
ask him if anything was going on in the
back seat so in terms of covering--

CHARLIE

You were listening at the door
GUST

I wasnt--
CHARLIE

You were standing at the goddam door and
listening

GUST
No--

CHARLIE
How could you--thats a thick door--
youre just standing there and--

GUST
Charlie I wasnt standing at the door
dont be an idict I bugged the bottle
The scotch

CHARLIE
What

GUST

Yeah its got a little transmitter on
it Ive got a thing in my ear

CHARLIE
I dont believe this
GUST
Look--
CHARLIE

Who the fuck are you

GUST
Charlie Charlie take it easy Its a
joke its a way of breaking the ice I
was gonna tell you about it but then I
had to leave the room for a second

‘cause you know cause you were getting

indicted

CHARLIE
Im not getting indicted Are there

cameras in here You’re gonna try to get

me to say something as stupid as John
Murtha did

GUST
Thats a little paranoid Charlie

CHARLIE

Youre right Could you just take the bug

off my scotch bottle now

Gust
Sure

CHARLIE settles himself down and gets to what he really wants

to talk about

CHARLIE
(pause)
I saw two kids whod had their hands
blown off when they picked up something
shiny

GUST
Tey bombs Bombs that lock like toys

CHARLIE
For children to pick up

GUST
Yeah

CHARLIE
Theyre raping women
GUST
Yeah
CHARLIE

And bayonetting the pregnant ones

GUST
Its as bad as it can be

CHARLIE
Then why do you want to buy three
Oerlikons when we should be buying fifty

GUST
Hm

CHARLIE
See You thought you were gonna be the
crazy person in this scene National
Security Directive 63 says that Soviet
invading forces “will be repelled by any
means necessary It authorizes the CIA--
thats you--to submit a plan to “build
our own capabilities to project force
into the region and to assist other
countries in the region to deter and
diminish internal and external threats to
stability

GUST
You memorized it

CHARLIE
The CIA shall submit a plan to be
approved by Congress Submit me a plan

GUST
Listen Charlie youve had a long
flight youre under stress youre under
arrest —-—

CHARLIE
Im not under arrest Would you like a
drink

GUST
Sure

CHARLIE
Should we try the scotch or does it
release serin gas when you open it

GUST
I dont think so but open it over there

CHARLIE goes to the bar and begins making the drinks

CHARLIE
Howd a guy like you get into the Agency

GUST
You mean a street guy

CHARLIE
You aint James Bond

GUST
And you aint Thomas Jefferson so lets
call it even

CHARLIE
Deal
GUST
Since theres no other reason I should be
here lets assume its because Im very

good at this

CHARLIE
They have to shoot down the helicopters
they need at least 50 surface to air--

GUST
Thats gonna cost a lot more than ten
million dollars

CHARLIE
And I say for the fourth time that I can--

GUST
How How are you gonna get the approval
of Congress when theyre saying no to the
Contras which was a request made by the
President

CHARLIE
Because I sit on the sub-committee for
defense appropriations And when a black
approp makes it out of our committee the
full body has to vote on it blind
® (MORE)

CHARLIE (CONTD)
They know the dollar amount but they
dont know what its for So
theoretically your 10 million dollars
can become 200 million without anyone
really noticing but the Russians

GOST
Because Congress wouldnt know what it
was voting on

CHARLIE
Thats correct

GUST
I guess it was only a matter of time
before ineptitude could be harnessed for
good

CHARLIE
That’s right

Gust
All you need are the 49 other Committee
Members

CHARLIE
‘No all I need is the Chairman
GUST
Doc Long
CHARLIE
Doc Long
GUST

And with Docs backing youll get enough
votes from the other Committee Members

CHARLIE
This is my sixth term in Congress and my
greatest legislative achievement is
getting re-elected five times My other
achievement is that I hold more IQUs
than any member of the House It helps
that I represent the one district in
America that doesnt want anything They
want a government contract an army base
a paper products hall of famethey want
lower taxes and they want to be able to
carry a gun I vote yes a lot

(CONT INUED)

GUST
Is it possible Im talking to the one
Member of Congress who can get something
done in Afghanistan

CHARLIE
You are

GUST
And you want to buy 50 Oerlikons

CHARLIE

As well as the ammunition and any
captured Soviet weapons the Israelis and
Egyptians have Shoulder-mounted grenade
launchers stingers AK-47s money
training organizationIm not
interested in bleeding the Russians
Gust Im interested in killing them

INT AIRPLANE - LATER

Were in mid-flight The plane which holds 170 people has
about 11 passengers ZVI is sitting near the BODYGUARDS
CHARLIE GUST CAROL and BONNIE sit near each other Theyve
got drinks and work in front of them

CHARLIE
You know this is an historic plane Its
mandated by the Camp David Agreement One
flight per day between Israel and Egypt

BONNIE
(the empty plane)
And clearly Israelis and Egyptians alike
have been clamoring to take advantage of
it Carol the embassys sent me a
protocol memo for you

CAROL

BONNIE
Dos and donts
(off the memo)
Dont sleep with a man youre not married
to dont be too friendly dont perform
any suggestive moves-

CAROL
What

BONNIE
--like a pelvic grind and you cant show
your bare arms legs or mid-section

CAROL
It’s a belly dance How do I not be
suggestive to say nothing of concealing
my mid-section

GUST
Honey Id do what they tell you

CAROL
Whatll they do to me

GUST
Theyll arrest you theyre not kidding
around

CAROL
Neither am I A belly dance is meant to
make someone feel powerless over a woman
and sexually subjective

GUST
And thats right up an Islamic mans
alley

CAROL

I dance the way I dance and they can
arrest me after I do Excuse me

CAROL moves to the back of the plane

° BONNIE
Ill talk to her Maybe a fishnet body
stocking or something

Gus

BONNIE heads of to join CAROL in the back of the plane

CHARLIE
Her father was a hard line Baptist who

named Joe Shannon

GUST

CHARLIE
WellI slept with his wife But not

the side of his republican opponent and
ended his political career

GUST

CHARLIE

GUST

CHARLIE

INT MYSTERY LOUNGE - NIGHT

CAROL is in the middle of her dance with her MUSIC PLAYING
Although there are about a dozen men standing or seated at one
of the nightclub type tables CAROL performs her dance for an
audience of one--the DEFENSE MINISTER whos sitting in the
center of the room on what appears to be a large beanbag
chair though we know its obviously something more expensive

She pulls off her giant veil thats tied at the hips and then
uses the veil to create frames in which she strikes poses
Then she slides the veil around the DEFENSE MINISTERs neck
and ignores it

CHARLIE GUST and ZVI are sitting with HASSAN the Egyptian
Deputy Defense Minister at one of several nightclub style
tables that have been set up Several EGYPTIAN BODYGUARDS
stand around the perimeter and Zvis BODYGUARDS are also
present

TITLE
Cairo

HASSAN
Attack one Muslim and you attack all
Muslims The day of judgement shall pass
On that day God will take the vengeance
of our oppressed people who have been
driven from their land Fear God and fear
His vengeance upon those who oppress His
humble servants who submit to Him in
Islam

CHARLIE
(beat)
Well Im not sure I understood all of
that but Gust wants to know about the SA-
7 Grail surface to air missiles you have
He thinks they may have been stored
poorly

HASSAN
When these weapons help capture a platoon
of Russian soldiers praise Allah we
will saw off their heads and send their
cold decaying bodies back to Moscow while
their skulls hang in the center of Afghan
villages

CHARLIE
Wellwhat you de with their skulls is
really up to you but our question is-

HASSAN
The SA-7s were stored properly

GUST
We dont want em Charlie Theyre gonna
be corroded and the circuitrys gonna be
blown

HASSAN
Thats an extraordinary woman

CAROL is performing chest isolations and figure eight
movements with her hips as the DEFENSE MINISTER grips the veil
around his neck

CHARLIE
The Defense Minister seems to be enjoying
it
HASSAN
What do you mean by that
CHARLIE
(beat)

Nothing I didnt--

GUST
He didnt mean anything Youre not gonna
unload the SA-7s on us or the SPAAG Anti-
Aircraft

ZVI
Excuse me but what about the oppression
of my people

HASSAN
What

CHARLIE
What

2vL

You said Fear Gods vengeance upon those
who oppress His humble servants who
submit to him in Islam Whats your
feeling about His servants who submit to
Him at the foot of Mount Sinai

CHARLIE
Do we have to do this now

2VI
Im about to arrange for 35 million
dollars worth of guns to be put in the
hands of Muslims and Im wondering who
theyre ultimately gonna be pointed at

HASSAN
I meant no disrespect

ZVI
Really

And at that moment CAROL pulls a sabre from its sheath which
makes the DEFENSE MINISTERS BODYGUARDS jump toward the action-

CHARLIE
(jumping up)
Wait Its part of the dance Its part
of the dance
(to HASSAN)
Tell em its part of the dance

HASSAN
(in Arabic to the BODYGUARDS)
Its all right its part of the dance

CAROL has remained perfectly calm and focused during this
staring straight at the DEFENSE MINISTER The BODYGUARDS back
eff and she continues where she left off

CHARLIE and GUST sit back down

GUST
You have Soviet-licensed factories that
can put out Kalishnikovs at a rate of 50
a week is that correct

HASSAN
Thats correct

CAROL has taken the sabre and after wielding it several times
over the DEFENSE MINISTERs head points it directly at his
throat The BODYGUARDS jump--

CHARLIEGUST
(shouting together)
Its part of the danceIts part of the
damn dance

Lo

CHARLIE
Jesus Christ
GUST
What about city warfare devices
HASSAN
Like what
GusT

Bicycle bombs limpet mines plastic
trip wire mines

HASSAN
Yes

GUST
Were gonna want ‘em

HASSAN
Good because we must show the Russians
the same brutality theyve shown the
Afghans We will set fire to them alive
and dance around them in celebration as
they burn Killing Russians in any corner
of the earth is the greatest obligation
and the most excellent of ways to gain
nearness to Allah

2vVI
Well thats a nice bonus for you then

CHARLIE
Why dont we just enjoy the performance

And CAROL once again wields the sabre over the DEFENSE
MINISTERs head and points it at his throat

Everyone in the room tightens a little bit as she slides the
tip of the sword from the mans throat down to his groin Once
she has it there she lifts her eyes past the DEFENSE MINISTER
to meet the warrior gaze of his BODYGUARDS and we

GUST
Where I grew up which is Aliquippa
Pennsylvania theres a 97 year old woman
who thinks shes a witch And I paid her
80 dollars to put a curse on my Division
Chief

CHARLIE
(pause)
I dont--what

GUST
She comes from an order of women in
ancient Greece who were intermediaries
between the lords of the underworld and
the gods of Olympus The Greek Orthodox
Church was the first church it was
founded right after the death of Christ
and Nitsa--thats the witch--her
incantations dont come from the back of
a magazine they come from the bible And
she treats magic like science and science
like superstition She said shed get rid
of my Division Chief who wronged me
because Cursed be he who does the Lords
work remissly cursed be he who holds
back his sword from blood” She was
quoting Jeremiah

CHARLIE
How long has she been like that

GUST
Like what

CHARLIE

I dont know Crazy

INT BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

CHARLIE and GUST along with MCGAFFIN and three other experts
listen to a BRIEFER Theres a slide up A map of Afghanistan
with a dozen unconnected shaded areas The name of each group
is inside the shaded areas along with a dollar amount

BRIEFER
The Mujahideen dont act as a unified
resistance but rather several disparate
and uncoordinated guerilla forces

CHARLIE
Can they be trained to fight as an army

BRIEFER
Afghanistans barely a country No phones
or roads outside the cities Its likely
that a villager would live his life
without having contact with another
village three miles down the road unless
he was going to war against them

MCGAFFIN
The most successful rebels to date are in
the Panjshir Valley Theyre called the
United Front or sometimes the Northern
Alliance Weve earmarked them for 10
million in weapons and 10 to 15 CIA
Agency advisors for training

CHARLIE
De they have a leader

MCGAFFIN
Ahmad Shah Massoud Hes Tajik so hes
not well liked by the Pashtun

CHARLIE

The Tajik and the Pashtun have a problem
with each other

GUST
They say when a Tajik wants to make love
to a woman his first choice is always a
Pashtun man

radical brand of fundamentalism but
theyre doing a heck of a job wreaking
havoc on the Russians Wed like to

EXT AFGHAN BRIDGE - DAY

Its a narrow bridge connecting the sides of two mountains A
four truck caravan comes into view and starts across the
bridge And now we see a Soviet flag on the side of each
truck

And now we see three MUJAHIDEEN tucked in a rock crevice They
each have high-powered sniper rifles and have the scopes
trained sharply on the first truck in the caravan as it heads
to the middle of the bridge

Then SNAP-SNAP-SNAP--they fire off three shots that disable
the first truck and send it screeching to a halt forcing the
three trucks behind it to stop in the middle of the bridge

Before anyone can figure out whats happening 40 MUJAHIDEEN
appear from nowhere on horseback at both ends of the bridge
each brandishing an AK-47 automatic assault rifle The
horsemen gallop quickly on the either side of the marooned
trucks firing hundreds of rounds into the cloth-covered truck
beds shredding the trucks and the soldiers inside

Amid frantic Russian radio clatter RUSSIAN soldiers scramble
to get out of the trucks and fight back but theyre ripped up
pretty easily

A MUJAHIDEEN watches from his horse as one RUSSIAN soldier
runs for his life and then jumps off the bridge falling about
200 feet to his death

The MUJ fires his gun in the air--

good days work and turn off the Lights

Well Id be happy to turn off the lights
but theres no electricity in

mow why thats a problem Because at
this moment over half the population of
Afghanistan is under 14 years old And
theyre gonna come home from the camps
and theyre gonna find that their
villages have been napalmed and their
fathers are dead

CHARLIE
You want a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan
A covert war to teach em how to read and
write

GUST
Yes Yes I do In fact I think we
shouldve said Sure well give you the
guns but first you have to build some
schools Lets see your 14 year old boys
pass general knowledge tests in history
and science When they pass em well
give you the bullets

CHARLIE
Whats more important to the history of

liberation of Central Europe and the end
of the Cold War

pray five times a day to a God who
requires more sucking up than a movie

eager to die in huge numbers with the
expectation that theyll be met in
paradise by 70 virgins who by the way
Im not entirely convinced are meant to
be women Im not worried though ‘cause
I know if Islamic fanaticism ever gets
outa hand Joanne Herring and her friends
will rise up to meet it with Christian
fanaticism and then weve got ourselves a
ball game And I wouldnt be that
concerned except we just sent enough
weapons over there to kill everyone on
both sides

CHARLIE
Yeah and we helped them win a war

cUST
r They dont get home delivery of The New

them to fight our war theyre gonna see
us in Israel and theyre gonna be mad I
come from this mentality Charlie We
