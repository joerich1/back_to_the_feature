damage repaired we are almost
home Yet I feel -- uneasy And I
wonder why

INT BRIDGE - USS ENTERPRISE - CLOSE - JAMES T KIRK 7

He is stalking the bridge lost in his thoughts CAMERA IS
MOVING with him In bg bridge activity is normal

KIRK (VO)

Perhaps it is the erratic
behavior of Ships surgeon McCoy
Or the emptiness of this vessel
most of our trainee crew have been
reassigned Lieutenant Saavik and
my son David are exploring a new

world and Enterprise feels like
a house with all the children
gone No More empty even than
that

He has reached Spocks vacant chair He touches it

KIRK (VO) (CONTD)
(continuing)
The news of Spocks tube has shaken

me

It seems that I have left the

noblest part of myself back there

on that newborn planet

We HOLD on him Then he shakes off his mood and

SCOTTY
Eight weeks sir
(as Kirk opens his mouth)
But you dont have eight weeks so
Ill do it for ya in two

KIRK

Mr Scott Have you always
multiplied your repair estimates by
a factor of four

SCOTTY
Certainly sir How else can I keep
my reputation as a miracle worker

KIRK
Your reputation is secure Scotty

Aye sir

Kirk heads for the elevator presses the door button He is
about to enter when he is intercepted by TRAINEE FOSTER a
young black officer too eager for protocol

TRAINEE FOSTER

What the hell are you saying

Even Bones is stunned by what has come out of his mouth He
tries to cope with his own disorientation

Why did we leave Spock

truth Hes gone Spock is gone
And we both have to live with that

Bones looks at Kirk for an agonized moment Then the
elevator comes to a stop the doors opens McCoy takes a step

removes the veil showing us a fascinating face of Klingon

she is enveloped in smoke and flames

be beamed aboard until danger of

Can you guarantee that

is obvious beaming down to the

the mission is vital and reasonably
free of danger I know the book

romantic A smoky haze persists The PAN STOPS as we hear a
familiar ENERGY SOUND And Saavik and David begin to appear

in the BEAM DOWN EFFECT

CLOSER ANGLE - SAAVIK AND DAVID

fully materialized They are equipped with scientific
backpacks Their TRICORDERS BLEEP reassuringly as they look

about

SAAVIK
(looking as perplexed as
she can)
Saavik to Grissom Request computer
study of soil samples for
geological aging

DAVID
(cutting in)
Ill handle that later

SAAVIK
My readings indicate great
instability

DAVID

Were not here to investigate
geological aging were here to
find life forms

His TRICORDER BLEEPS

DAVID (CONTD)
(continuing)
Come on

Saavik reacts to his tension with a questioning look Then
they move off

INT GRISSOM BRIDGE - FAVORING ESTEBAN (INTERCUT WITH SAAVIX)

He and his officers are monitoring the progress of the
landing party DATA SOUNDS fill the bridge

Then LT HINES points something out on a viewscreen

ESTEBAN
Grissom to landing party We have
you approaching radioactive
indications Do you concur

SAAVIK (VO)
Affirmative Captain Our readings
are well below danger level

ESTEBAN
Very well Exercise caution
Lieutenant This landing is
Captains discretion and Im the
one whos out on a limb

EXT GENESIS PLANET - HIGH SHOT - SPOCKS GLADE - DAY 58

readings as Saavik catches up to him Then to- gether they
start forward TOWARD US As they approach HIGH CAMERA NOW

The two explorers take readings they begin to realize what
they are heading for

Their tempo increases they follow their tricorders until

Saavik and David come INTO VIEW close by and stop seeing

David --
He joins her staring at
POV - SPOCKS CASKET - (ILM SHOT) 61

At the base of the tube worm-like forms shimmy and squirm
They are small horrible and unquestionably alive

SAAVIK AND DAVID 62

They try to maintain their scientific objectivity in spite
of their horror -- and their disappointment at not finding
some trace of Spock

DAVID
Well Theres your life form
reading These were microbes on the
tubes surface We shot them here
from Enterprise
(with irony)
They were fruitful and multiplied

SAAVIK

But How could they have evolved

so quickly
David doesnt answer his curiosity caught by something else
He starts slowly forward Saavik Following close Their
tricorders begin to register higher radiation levels as they
approach the tube
SERIES OF SHOTS - (PRODUCTION and ILM) 63
David and Saaviks faces as they approach

Feet step among the wormy creatures to gain access to the
tube (ILM)

Even the unemotional Saavik reacts to this

David reaches the tube raises the lid of Spocks bier He
looks inside and sees

DAVIDS POV INTO SPOCKS CASKET 64

It is empty except for some kind of rumpled black cloth

BACK TO DAVID 65
He reacts stunned

DAVID
Saavik Hes gone

He reaches in withdraws the shroud-like cloth and hands it
to Saavik As she touches she knows

DAVID (CONTD)
(continuing)
What is it

SAAVIK
Spocks burial robe

As they stare at each other without answers the planet makes
a gentle RUMBLING SOUND -- then the ground qui- vers
slightly

And in the far distance a poignant CRY is heard A young
animal in pain perhaps Saavik and David do not know

Excuse us please

KIRK (CONTD)

(continuing)
Sarek I would have come to
Vulcan to express my deepest
sympathies
SAREK

(raises a hand)
Spare me your human platitudes
Kirk I have been to your
Government I have seen the Genesis
information and your own report

KIRK
Then you know how bravely your son
met his death

SAREK
Met his death
(turning on Kirk)
How could you his friend have
assumed that Why did you leave him
on Genesis Spock trusted you --
and you denied him his future

KIRK
I -- saw no future --

SAREK
You missed the point then and
now Only his body was in

death Kirk And you were the last
one to be with him

KIRK
Yes I was

They look at him questioningly

leave their glasses and file
looks out in

SAR
Then you must

KIR
But -- why

SAR
Because he as
entrusted you

have come with him to Vulcan

K

ked you to He

with his very essence
thing was not of the

body He asked you to bring him to
us -- and to bring that which he
gave you his Katra His living
spirit

KIRK
(deeply quietly)
Sir Your son meant more to me than
you can know Id have given my
life if it would have saved his
You must believe me when I tell you
that he made no request of me

SAREK
He would not have spoken of it
openly

KIRK
Then how --
SAREK
(interrupting)
Kirk I must have your thoughts
May I join your mind

KIRK
Of course

Sarek steps close to Kirk as CAMERA PUSHES IN VERY CLOSE

fashion And the eyes of both men are closed

He turns now starting for the door Kirk stops him with an

have found a way If there was so
much at stake -- Spock would have

found a way

No Absolutely not Jim its out

ANGLE HAS WIDENED to include Kirk a passionate Kirk

KIRK
(deeply)

Harry Im off the record now Im
not speaking as one of your staff
Im talking about thirty years of
service I have to do this Harry
It has to do with my honor my life
-- everything I put any value on

The intimacy of the conversation is broken by a starfleet
steward who bears drinks Kirk sits in frustrated suspension
until the steward leaves Then Kirk tries to resume his plea
but Morrow stays him

MORROW
Jim You are my best officer and
if I had a best friend youd be
that too But I am Commander
Starfleet so I dont break rules

KIRK
Dont quote rules Harry Were
talking about loyalty And
sacrifice One man who died for us
another who has deep emotional
damage --

MORROW
Now wait a minute This business
about Spock and McCoy

MORROW (CONTD)
Honestly I have never understood

Vulcan mysticism -- Im sorry But

part of me doesnt want you to make

a fool of yourself Understand
KIRK

Harry you dont have to believe
Im not even sure I believe But if
theres even a chance that Spock
has an eternal soul -- then that is
my responsibility

MORROW

KIRK
As surely as if it were my own
(deeply)
Harry give me back the Enterprise
With Scottys help

MORROW
No Jim Enterprise would never
stand the pounding

KIRK
Then Ill find a ship -- Ill hire
a ship

MORROW

Out of the question The Council
has ordered that no one but the
science team goes to Genesis

KIRK
(desperately)
Then let me speak to the Council
Harry please I can make them
understand

Kirks voice and passion has risen enough to now gather a
response from neighboring tables Kirk realizes he checks
himself draws slightly back Morrow is firm

MORROW
No you understand The Council
has its hands full with Klingons
and Romulans Theyre trying to
hammer out a treaty on the Genesis
Device and they havent got time
for your personal views on
friendship and metaphysics

emotional behavior and youll lose

Kirk looks for a long moment then sighs his body sagging

KIRK
Yes I hear you

I just had to try

MORROW
Of course Now take my
suggestion enjoy your leave -- and

let all this tension blow away

KIRK

Youre right

Kirk rises with a smile starts out HOLD on Morrow

He crosses the room filled with Starfleet senior officers
CAMERA TRACKING until he passes out of the main room into

Chekov waiting for him conspiratorially Kirk stops close to

A crowded smoke-filled watering hole of the twenty- third
century filled with a smattering of civilians Starfleet
personnel and visitors from strange and far off
civilizations It does not have the bizarre qualities of the

McCoy is discovered entering the bar He is haggard less
than clean shaved He appears to be looking for something as
he starts forward

HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH THE BAR (ILM ELEMENT) 85

noting patrons at the twenty-third century equivalent of
video games darts We see two people playing at a
holographic version of a video game in which World War 1
biplanes are engaged in 3-d combat and a dart player
throwing pneumatic jet propelled darts BACK TO McCOY
81 Not finding what he is looking for he settles into a
small alcove A seedy but attractive WAITRESS arrives

WAITRESS
Long time Doc
MCCOY
Yeah Anyone been looking
for me
WAITRESS
I have But whats the use
(a smile)

Whatll it be

MCCOY
Altair water
(grandly)
Specially carbonated from
underground fissures

WAITRESS
Not your usual poison

85

MCCOY
(confused)
To expect one to order poison in a
bar is not logical
(he catches himself)
Excuse me Im on medication

WAITRESS
Got it

She leaves McCoy scans the room He picks out some- one
approaching

ANGLE - THE ALIEN 86

an exotic-looking grubby fellow with a big grin making his
way unmistakably to McCoys booth PULL BACK with him as he
reaches it and slides in ebulliently

ALIEN
Hello Welcome to your planet

stranger

How can you get a permit to do a
damn illegal thing

Look price you name money I got

ALIEN
You name place I name money
Otherwise bargain no

MCCOY
(getting louder)
Alright dammit Its Genesis The
name of the place were going is

ALIEN
(genuinely shocked)
Genesis
MCCOY

Genesis yes How can you be deaf
with ears like that

ALIEN
Genesis allowed is not Is planet
forbidden
MCCOY
Now listen to me my backwards
friend
(grabs the Alien by the
collar)

Genesis may be planet forbidden
but Im damn well --

McCoy is interrupted by a hand on his arm He looks up to see
a nondescript-looking CIVILIAN with a gentle ingratiating
manner

CIVILIAN
Sir Im sorry but your voice is
carrying I dont think you want to
be discussing this subject in
public 86

MCCOY
Ill discuss what I like and who
the hell are you

CIVILIAN
Could I offer you a ride home Dr
McCoy

MCCOY

Wheres the logic in offering me a
ride home you idiot If I wanted a
ride home would I be trying to
charter a space flight

(then)
How the hell do you know who I am

CIVILIAN
Federation Security sir

Its a bad moment for the agent to have announced himself A
desperate Bones releases the Alien and rises to his feet just
as the Waitress arrives with his Altair water on a tray The
Altair water spills on the Alien
SERIES OF CUTS 87
The Alien hit by the water leaps to his feet in rage
The Waitress is knocked into a group of people
More spilling of drinks
A bystander thinking the Alien hit the Waitress hits him
A general scuffle begins
Meanwhile McCoy tries to race around the Civilians end of
the confusion but the agent (very big) grabs him Bones in
confusion and panic suddenly turns wild-eyed and attempts
a Vulcan nerve pinch on his tormentor The nerve pinch has
absolutely no effect and the agent stares at Bones for a
long moment

Youre going to get a nice long

rest Doctor
He ushers Bones out as the brouhaha continues in bg

As they start forward into the snow Saavik drawing her
phaser They peer ahead seeing nothing but the BLEEP of
their tricorder which they follow like a beacon

Their POV MOVING through the snow flurry catches an
occasional hint of something ahead which spurs them on

Then with the TRICORDER BEEP indicating very close
proximity they stop and intuitively Saavik indicates to
David to turn the tricorder off As the beep stops they
listen and hear the tiniest of WHIMPERS amid the WIND They
start out excitedly

A wild thing with scraggly hair perhaps nine or ten years
old He covers his nakedness as he shivers in the cold
clutching an injured leg he watches the strangers and their
BEEPING machine in hypnotic fear

THE SCENE - IN THE CREVICE 93

At Saaviks gesture David turns off his tricorder Saavik
moves close As she touches the Boys leg he pulls back and
she reaches out to his face and touches his cheek softly he
accepts watchfully Then Saavik slides her hand slowly and
parts the scraggly hair The Boy is a Vulcan

Saavik and David exchange and astonished look Then she
covers the boy with Spocks robe and in Vulcan

It would seem that Grissom was
destroyed by an enemy attack

DAVID
You mean were stranded down

Logic indicates that is the case

DAVID

How can you be logical at a time
like this We have to get thee
hell off this planet

SAAVIK
That may be difficult

DAVID
Why dont you just call for help

SAAVIK
I have already made one
transmission too many

David looks at her understanding now looks away in despair
He covers his face with his hands now

SAAVIK (CONTD)

Its time for total truth between
us

(then)

This planet is not what you
intended or hoped for is it

DAVID
(ironically)
Not exactly

SAAVIK
Why

DAVID
(a pause)
I used protomatter in the Genesis
matrix

102 102

SAAVIK
Protomatter An unstable substance
which every ethical scientist in
the galaxy has denounced as
dangerously unpredictable

DAVID
(defensive)
It was the only way to solve
certain problems --

SAAVIK
Did your collaborator know

DAVID
My mother knew nothing about it
Thats why I asked her to leave
Genesis in my hands

SAAVIK
So like your father you changed
the rules

DAVID
If I hadnt it might have been
years -- or never

SAAVIK

And how many have paid the price
for your impatience How many have
died How much damage have you
done And what is yet to come

BEEPING INCREASES with each step Then abruptly the

STOP listening to the rumble

The earth shakes As it does a hideous high-pitched SQUEAL
is heard nearby OS (This is different than the cry we have
heard on the planet) As the surface stops shaking the
SQUEAL TAPERS OFF -- but the TRI- CORDER BEEPS remain very

study This has the macho quality of a bullfighter getting

within an inch of the bull The crew watches breathlessly

Then suddenly --

The Thing makes a squidlike coiling motion and wraps itself
around Kruges neck and right arm Its squeezing hard

The crew reacts but are wisely stayed by the Sergeant This
is the bosss show

Kruge responds in a worthy manner Even though the Thing is
coiling tightly Kruge exerts all the strength he has in what
he correctly guesses to be the creatures jugular The

creature POPS -- its strength collapses -- and it slithers
down and falls away from its conqueror He takes a moment to
enjoy the crews reaction then

now splits the air and

THE YOUNG SPOCK 162

He turns TO CAMERA suddenly a YOUNG MAN in his late teens
lean of face high of cheekbone The look on this tortured
face and his body language tell us he is fighting for control
of body and his world He is fevered and shuddering He looks
at Saavik with wild eyes which are both frightened -- and
frightening

She approaches him cautiously but with absolute under-
standing She stops a step away from him

Will you trust me

Spock does not respond he is in quiet agony She kneels
beside him His breathing is labored Saavik offers her
hand in Pon Farr configuration -- like a two-finger Boy Scout
salute Spock studies it then she brings up his right hand
in the same configuration

163

With her two extended fingers she touches his and then slowly
begins to stroke his entire hand in gentle fore- play His
breathing eases now his body begins to relax Uncertainly
he begins to return the finger- play first on Saaviks hand
and then on her temples

He is more in control now intense His eyes turn and lock
on hers Hands touching they move together until their faces
are brushing and their fingers embrace

the Federation Starship Enterprise

On the Bird of Prey Kruges reaction to Kirks face

KRUGE
So The Genesis Commander himself

KIRKS IMAGE
By violation of treaty between
the Federation and Klingon Empire
your presence here is an act of
war You have two minutes to
surrender your crew and your
vessel or we will destroy you

KRUGE
(to Torg)
Hes hiding something We may have
dealt him a more serious blow than
I thought

TORG
How can you tell that

Admiral Kirk This is your opponent
speaking
206 INT ENTERPRISE BRIDGE (AND INTERCUT) 206

Do not lecture me about treaty
violations The Federation in
creating an ultimate weapon has
become a gang of Intergalactic
criminals It is not I who will
surrender it is you

(a pause)
On the planet below I have three
prisoners from the team who
developed your doomsday weapon If
you do not surrender immediately I
will execute them one at a time
as enemies of galactic peace

I will let you speak to them

EXT GENESIS - THE KLINGON CAMP (INTERCUT) 207

As Kruges VOICE barks a Klingon order over the commun-
icator Saavik David and the Vulcan are rousted to their
feet by the Klingons and assembled in a line The Sergeant
thrusts the communicator in front of Saavik pokes her to
make his command clear She leans into the communicator
controlling carefully

SAAVIK
Admiral this is Lieutenant Saavik
KIRK
(softly)
Saavik Is David with you
SAAVIK

Yes he is And someone else
Vulcan scientist of your

acquaintance
KIRK

This Vulcan -- is he alive
SAAVIK

He is not himself -- but he lives

He is subject to rapid aging --
like this unstable planet

The Sergeant has had enough with her long windedness pulls

the communicator and thrusts it in front of David

DAVID
Hello sir Its David

KIRK
(shaken)
David Sorry Im late
DAVID
Its okay -- I should have known
youd come Saaviks right this

Kill one of them I dont care
which

The Sergeant has received the order He draws a dis- tinctive
Klingon dagger frightening to behold As KIRKS VOICE is
heard INDISTINCTLY PROTESTING over the communicator the
Sergeant walks behind the assembled line of the three
prisoners the Vulcan youth Saavik and David It is like a
game of Russian Roulette We do not know where the blow will
fall Then the Sergeant has picked his victim and raises
his dagger back to strike --

ANGLE 210

It is Saavik he intends to kill David his face curled in
rage leaps forward grabs the mans arm The struggle is
short

David takes a knife in the chest
INT ENTERPRISE BRIDGE (INTERCUT) 211

The CRY OF PAIN is heard on the speakers There is a horrible
silence that follows

KIRK

At last we hear the shaken voice of Saavik

SAAVIK
Admiral David is dead

There is none of these three Kirk would have parted with But
David He fights back the horror as Bones steps to his side
-- but finally he must let it go

KIRK
You Klingon bastard Youve killed
my son

Kruge takes this news with a blink of triumph Calmly

KRUGE
There are two more prisoners
Admiral Do you want them killed

hurries off to correct the situation

and with a strong arm hurls her easily aside The GROUND
RUMBLES again The Vulcan cries out THE Klingon fascinated
by the Vulcans behavior approaches then reaches out
toward him

SAAVIK
No dont touch him

The Klingon ignores He puts his hand on the Vulcan and for
his trouble in a blur of action gets grabbed whacked and
hurled through the air by a burst of the Vulcans strength

she rises to Kirk

be done Then deciding he whips out his communicator

well on the planets surface

BACK TO KIRK 251

KIRK (CONTD)
I know this will come as a pleasant

surprise for you But you see our

unfortunate accident Im sorry

about your crew old boy but --
cest la vie as we say on Earth

A lightning flash makes him cover his eyes Then

KIRK (CONTD)

(continuing)
Well Im waiting for you What
is your answer

(only static more

desperately)
I have what you want I have the
secret of Genesis But youll
have to bring us up there to get
it Do you hear me

More STATIC Kirks ploy has apparently failed He sags a
bit starts back toward the crew when another series of
flashes blind them all as the planet rumbles with sound and
fury and Spock moans Then Kirk and crew do not see what to
do

In the near distance amid the flashings a figure is
revealed lost in the confusion It is Kruge phaser in hand

A flash of lightning A movement of earth The sudden HISS of
a FISSURE OF STEAM through the surface And the two men
face each other shouting above the planet noises

KRUGE

KIRK

Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk
KRUGE

Give me what I want -- and Ill

consider it

255

IRK
You fool -- look around you This
planet is destroying itself

RUGE
Yes Exhilarating isnt it

IRK
If we dont help each other well
all die here

RUGE
Perfect Thats the way it shall
be Give me Genesis

Suddenly the very ground on which he stands seems to become
an elevator He is carried rapidly upward on a craggy rock
formation which bursts upward out of the ground Kruge
tumbles and Kirk seizes the opportunity --

THE FIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS 256

irk leaps upon Kruge and they roll and struggle on the
churning erupting ground

They are evenly matched Kirks opening momentum holds until
ruges great size begins to turn the tide He takes
temporary command with swift vicious kicks and punches Kirk
is down

ruge now looks around for his phase starts for it but
irk in a series of ground rolls trips Kruge up with his
legs and comes on

The off-balance Kruge now takes a series of punches from Kirk
which make him reel backward near the edge of the promontory
A final blow from Kirk forces Kruge over the edge -- and he

-- tumbles and rolls down the fifteen foot slope Kirk peers
over the edge to see

KIRKS POV - (ILM ELEMENTS) 257
Kruge has landed on a level precipice about fifteen feet in

diameter Beyond that is an endless drop into a chasm the
bottom of which has become a glowing red river of LAVA

ON THE PRECIPICE - UP ANGLED (ILM ELEMENTS) 258

As Kruge rises to his feet Kirk without hesitation soars
into the air from above and dives upon Kruge the momentum of
the dive taking both men right to the edge of the final drop

258

They work their way to their feet and continue the struggle
anew pieces of the rock edge slipping away under their feet
as they scuffle Kirk is winning until

With a burst of energy Kruge shoves Kirk hard and Kirk slams
into a wall of stone dazed Kruge has him -- but as he
starts to step forward the edge of the rock he is standing
on starts to slip

FULL - THE PRECIPICE - (ILM ELEMENTS) 259

Kirk on the left against the wall Kruge on the right on the
edge Kruge is dropping lower The rock forma- tion he is on
now breaks away carrying him outward

KIRK
(shouts)
Jump -- damn you

Kruge does jump forward at the last possible instant as the
rock falls away He leaps to

THE NEW EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE (ILM ELEMENTS) 260

Where Kruge lands precariously hanging on almost by his
fingernails Hes holding on as best as he can his legs
flailing unable to gain any purchase to boost him up

Kirk recovering his own strength sees Kruge in this
helpless situation He comes forward to the edge kneels over
the Klingon

IRK
Give me your hand and we both live
RUGE
(screams a curse in
Klingon)
IRK
Dont be a fool -- give me your

hand

Kruge looks down measuring the terror below as if
considering then with sudden and explosive strength vaults
upward making a desperate grab for Kirk He has a leg
Suddenly Kirk is fighting not to be pulled over the edge He
is losing that fight Till he lashes out with a blow The
Klingons grip slips yet he hangs on tenaciously until --
with a cry of rage --

260
KIRK (CONTD)
(continuing)
I have had enough of you
Kirk turns and kicks Kruge mightily -- and the Klingon begins
his fall
WIDE DOWN ANGLED SHOT - (ILM ELEMENTS) 261
Kirk in fg watches as Kruge tumbles endlessly toward the

steaming red hot lava beds below

ON KIRK 262

He turns now to his ultimate problem the planet is caving in
around him He starts to scramble up the steep slope back to
the promontory where --

THE PROMONTORY - SPOCK 263

His inert body lies surrounded by new bursts of steam from
the cracking earth

ANGLE - KIRK (ILM ELEMENT) 264
Behind him we see the first signs of a fast rising fireball
sun He claws his way back to the top level and races to
Spocks fallen form He kneels and turns the body over to
see

PAST KIRK TO SPOCK 265

We see the face at last it is Spock at the age he died

But he is also a haggard ravaged shell of a being almost
again dead from the agonies of change -- and even now with
soft frightening sounds giving indications of the final
changes that lie just ahead

KIRK - SUN LARGER BEHIND HIM (ILM ELEMENTS) 266

Amid the death knell of this place Kirk knows it is now or
never A desperate idea forms With determination he picks
Spock up and shoulders him Then drawing his communicator he
flips it open and takes his best shot

KIRK
(in guttural Klingon)
Maltz Activate beam

266

There is a moment of uncertainty Kirk is about to try again
when the Klingon beam SOUND begins and

BEAM UP EFFECT - (ILM ELEMENTS) 267

Amid the groans flashes the HISSES OF STEAM and falling
debris Kirk carrying Spock dematerializes in the KLINGON
BEAM even as the sun appears to be coming closer

and closer still casting yellow white light over the
disintegrating surface

INT BIRD OF PREY 269

The doors WHOOSH open and Kirk carrying the inert Spock
steps out phaser at the ready

REVERSE - INCLUDING KIRK 270

Maltz on the Captains deck the Enterprise prisoners below
Maltz turns expecting Kruge and is clearly astonished as
he raises his hands Kirk steps forward

KIRK
How many more

SCOTTY
Just him sir

KIRK
Bones help Spock Everyone else
find a station

A flurry of activity as the crew moves into position in the
strange -- yet familiar bridge McCoy takes Spock from Kirk
guides him OUT OF SCENE and Saavik takes Maltz phaser and
steps back To Maltz

KIRK (CONTD)
(continuing)
You Help us or die

MALTZ
I do not deserve to live

KIRK

Fine Ill kill you later Lets
get out of here

270

And so saying he dashes OUT OF SHOT followed by Saavik The
Klingon can only stare in confusion

SPACE - THE GENESIS PLANET - (ILM) 271
We are near her now ERUPTING surface flames shoot out
Beyond her sun waits former friend now ready to accept the

confronted by familiar tools but baffling zymology

KIRK

Well take your best shot

Scotty hunched over the console Chekov hunched over him

CHEKOV
If you can bypass into the module -

SCOTTY
Fine but wheres the damn anti-

Scotty makes several adjustments presses some buttons then
with a deep breath moves a sliding handle for- ward A HIGH

Sulu responds to the panel indicator

SULU

If I read this right sir we have
full power

KIRK
Go Sulu

Sulu impels the throttle device -

SPACE - BIRD OF PREY - (ILM) 275

Turning gracefully she gains speed PASSES CAMERA and heads
for the stars with increasing velocity breaking to Warp Speed
as -

SPACE - GENESIS AND HER SUN - (ILM) 276

The planet is now heading toward the sun We watch in wonder

as she gains speed and becomes a glazing fireball plummeting
spectacularly to her own destruction

BRIDGE - BIRD OF PREY 277

The mood is subdued somber

SAAVIK
The Genesis planet is gone

KIRK
(a whisper)
Goodbye David

SULU
We are clear and free to navigate

KIRK
Best speed to Vulcan Mr Chekov
take the prisoners below

CHEKOV
Aye sir

As he starts to

MALTZ
Wait You said you would kill me

KIRK
I lied

At Kirks gesture Chekov leads Maltz out Kirk turns back to
his panel

SULU

Estimating Vulcan at point one
niner

CAMERA MOVES IN to Kirk and Saavik

KIRK
Saavik message to Ambassador
Sarek Tell him we bring McCoy and
a living Spock Ask him to prepare
for the Katra ritual

Saavik raises an eyebrow

SAAVIK
Yes Admiral But that may not be
possible

KIRK
(turning)
What What are you saying

SAAVIK
The Katra ritual is meant to
deposit Spocks consciousness in
the Hall of Ancient Thought - not
in his body

KIRK
But we have Spock alive Thats
more than we bargained for

SAAVIK
Or less What you describe is
called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion
It is very dangerous The elders
may not choose to attempt it

KIRK
And if they dont What will
Happen to Spock

SAAVIK
He will remain always as he is

As Kirk wrestles with the horror of this we see

INT BIRD OF PREY SICK BAY - CLOSE - SPOCK

He is pale comatose fragile looking WIDEN as
a scanner over the form the scanners sound is
stops in frustration checks Spocks eyes then
wearily Softly as CAMERA begins to ARC around

Bones passes
feeble McCoy
turns back
them

278

MCCOY

(wearily)
Spock Ive done everything I know

(to do)
Help me You struck me with it
for Gods sake teach me what to do
with it

(a pause then)
I never thought Id say this to
you but it seems Ive missed you
And I couldnt bear to lose you
again

He lowers his head in helpless grief on the form of the
unmoving Spock and CAMERAS ARC has revealed Kirk standing
watching Kirk steps forward now puts his hand gently on
McCoy then on Spock Three lives intertwined for so long
SPACE - THE PLANET VULCAN - (ILM) 279

The great hill to the Temple is lined with hundreds of
Vulcans many with torches It is most impressive

BACK TO KIRK - MCCOY - SAAVIK 289
KIRK
My God
SAAVIK

Much is at stake

Then Kirk sees something else reacts as

UHURA 290

Crosses to the crew -- is hugged by Kirk Her eyes are moist
with emotion as

UHURA
Sarek is waiting above

Kirk nods and Uhura falls in place behind him helping to
carry Spocks form with the others They now carry Spock OUT
OF SCENE as we begin to hear RITUAL CHANTS and MUSIC in the
distance

DISSOLVE TO

The procession is in progress through a path lined on both
sides by simply-robed Vulcans of all ages Spocks form makes
passage to stately MUSIC

Vulcans responding to Spocks passage
FEATURE A small girl releases herself from her fathers grip
and moves alongside the body makes the Vulcan salute and

whispers with great solemnity

REACTION CUTS from Kirk and the others And we --
DISSOLVE TO
EXT VULCAN - UPPER LEVEL OF TEMPLE AREA - SERIES OF SHOT293

Sarek some DIGNITARIES and SIX VULCAN WOMEN tall and
stately are waiting MUSICIANS are close by now As the
Enterprise group reaches Sarek he steps forward to meet
them Now a silence falls

Sarek stands at his sons head and gently places his two
hands on Spocks face When he is done he looks at Kirk and
McCoy They search his face for some indication of hope but
Sarek is expressionless He steps back now gestures The
Vulcan women come forward and take Spock from his friends

293

As the transfer is completed the procession begins again
toward the temple entry Sarek falls in behind the body Kirk
and his group follow him

DISSOLVE TO
INT VULCAN TEMPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS 294

The Hall of Ancient Thought lined with massive heads of
stone DOLLY with the procession as an amazing thing takes
place

As Spocks body moves now seen -- now blocked by passing
forms we realize the bearers hands are no longer under the
body but are ON TOP OF IT

The magic of this moment is not lost on Kirk Bones and the
others as we --

DISSOLVE TO
EXT VULCAN ALTAR AREA - SERIES OF SHOTS (ILM ELEMENTS) 295

A great saucer-shaped platform under the Vulcan sky with an
altar at the far end The dramatic figure of a VULCAN
PRIESTESS stands there Rising into the air behind her is an
elegant version of the Vulcan hand salute shaped in gleaming
metal

The bearers continue with Spock toward the altar but Sarek
stops here on the threshold and stops Kirk and group

SAREK
This is where you will wait

Sarek turns to face the altar Spocks body is deposited
there to ritual MUSIC Then the powerful CHANT of the HIGH
PRIESTESS begins

Kirk and McCoy and the others stare in awe at what is
happening as the Priestess chant flows over them Then the
CHANT ENDS Sarek steps forward A HORN SOUNDS Then

PRIESTESS
Sarek Child of Skon Child of
Solkar The body of your son
breathes still What is your wish

SAREK

I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan the
refusion

295 295

PRIESTESS
What you seek has not been done
since ages past -- and then only
in legend Your request is not
logical

SAREK
Forgive me TLar My logic falters
where my son is concerned

She looks at him for a long moment Then

PRIESTESS
Who is the Keeper of the Katra

As Sareks nod and Kirks urgent look Bones replies

uncertainly
MCCOY
I am McCOY Leonard H
(adding)

Son of David

PRIESTESS (CONTD)

(deep ominous)
McCoy Son of David Since thou
art human we cannot expect thee to
understand fully what Sarek has
requested The circumstances are
extraordinary Spocks body
lives With your approval we
shall use all our powers to return
to his body that which you possess
his essence But McCoy

(a pause)
You must now be warned the danger
to thyself is as grave as the
danger to Spock

(this impacts on McCoy and

Kirk)
You must make the choice

MCCOY
(pause then)
I choose the danger
(then aside to Kirk)
Helluva time to ask

PRIESTESS
Bring him forward 295

As Sarek leads Bones toward the altar we HOLD on Kirks new
apprehension

THE ALTAR - (INTERCUT WITH KIRK AND CREW) - SERIES OF SHOR96

Sarek and McCoy reach the altar and Sarek departs The
Priestess intones another short CHANT punctuated by GONGS
and MUSICAL emphatics Then chant and music stop and we hear
only the gentle SOUND OF THE WIND and far-off TEMPLE CHIMES
She places a hand on Bones face another on Spocks Then
eerily

PRIESTESS
All that can be done shall be
done Though it take full turn of

the Vulcan sun

SOFT MUSIC now She begins drifting into a trance like mind
meld chanting softly almost inaudibly

CLOSE on McCoy And Spock Their eyes are closed A sense
of kinetic energy somehow passing between them

LONG DISSOLVE
TO

EXT VULCAN TEMPLE AREA - HIGH FULL SHOT - SUNRISE - (ILMP9

The early morning sun casts a different long-shadowed hot
look on the altar and threshold

OUTSIDE THE ALTAR - KIRK THE CREW 300

From where they had watched from last night here they have
waited lain down They are beginning to stir when the SOUND
OF A GONG brings them fully awake They rise bleary eyed to
see
THEIR POV - TOWARD THE ALTAR 301

The High Priestess exhausted is being carried out of the
altar area on a sedan chair As she leaves Sarek supporting
a weary McCoy heads a procession of hooded robed priests
Among them we now see a HOODED ROBED FIGURE all in WHITE

The procession is passing Kirks party while Kirk and the
crew can only stare in uncertainty Then Sarek signals the
others to continue while he with McCoy breaks off and comes
to Kirk

KIRK AND CREW 302
They wait now as Bones leaning on Sarek ENTERS SHOT

KIRK
Bones

MCCOY
All right Im all right Jim

Sulu and Scotty reach for him help support him He is
weakened but otherwise all right Kirk gestures toward the
white-robed figure walking slowly away

KIRK (CONTD)
What about Spock

SAREK
I am not sure Only time will
answer
(then)
Kirk I thank you What you have
done is --
KIRK
What I have done I had to do
SAREK
But at what cost Your ship Your
son
KIRK

If I hadnt tried the cost would
have been my soul

Sarek looks at him with deep admiration then turns and heads
back to the group of priests The wind blows and --
KIRK AND GROUP 303

They are now looking into the low sun shading their eyes for
a last look at the white-robed figure

POV - SAREK AND GROUP - LONG LENS 304

They are moving slowly away when suddenly the white- robed
figure stops turns toward the Enterprise group

CLOSE - THE WHITE HOOD 305

We cannot see the features beneath but we know the figure is
staring After a moment the figure starts back to the
Enterprise group As two priests reach to stop him they are
stayed by Sarek who now watches with interest

KIRK AND GROUP 306
watching with held breath as the white-robed figure walks
steadily to them reaches them

THE FIGURE 307

Back lit The wind whips his garment Now he lowers his hood
We see Spock a radiant gentled Spock His age is as we have
known it his hair his face the same he would look at
peace except for the eyes which remain hollow filled with
questions and uncertainties

SCENE - VARIOUS ANGLES 308
The Enterprise crew each of them stares back at Spock as
SUBJECTIVE CAMERA PANS PAST them SLOWLY Each makes his own
effort to be remembered but --

Spock remains churning but uncertain Then he looks hardest
at all at

Kirk The wind whips his hair

Something triggers in Spock He steps forward and then in an
odd rusty voice

SPOCK
I know you Do I not

KIRK
Yes And I know you

308

SPOCK

My father says you have been my

friend You came back for me
KIRK

You would have done the same for

me
SPOCK

(searching)

Why would you do this

KIRK
(grasping to make a
connection)
Because the needs of the one

outweighed the needs of the many

Spock stares at him A vague connection has been made -- but
not enough Spock turns away in uncertainty begins walking
back to the group he left Kirk raises his helpless hand
after Spock wondering what he might have said should have
said -- when suddenly

Spock stops back to Kirk He closes his eyes looks to the
sky And like someone who has found a piece of a puzzle he
says

SPOCK
I have been and ever shall be
your friend

Kirk steps forward a few steps -- hushed encouraging --
KIRK
Yes yes Spock
SPOCK
(half turns)
The ship Out of danger
KIRK
(deeply)

You saved the ship Spock You
saved us all Dont you remember

There is an odd moment after Kirks impassioned speech Spock

cocks his head as if some vital piece of information had just
clicked into place

308 308
SPOCK
(softly)
Jim Your name is Jim

Kirks eyes well with tears He nods his head

KIRK
Yes

Their eyes are locked together Spock gives a little nod of
satisfaction as if knowing he has taken the first of many

steps He turns to share this with McCoy And then with
them all We have the feeling that Spock has come back to his
family and to us

309 ON ENTERPRISE FAMILY 309

They have gathered round Kirk now beaming at Spock through
their tears and their joy knowing they all have a future
together As the CAMERA PULLS UP AND BACK from this we ROLL
END CREDITS and --

FADE OUT
