falls In contrast to the warmth of her memory the meadow
is cold gloomy cloudy And no Edward She closes her
eyes trying to force Edward here

Nothing Her eyes open on the empty overcast meadow
Bella sinks to her knees Tears threatening But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise She turns toward it peers into the

woods

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods
She spins toward it -- nothing Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --

assessing her as --

dietary restrictions were difficult -
living on nothing but animals

Suddenly hes standing inches from her She now sees his
EYES Dark blood-red

Tell me Bella Do you ever feel
compelled to cheat

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him

LAURENT
But thats not why I left I came
back here as a favor to Victoria

BELLA

LAURENT
(shrugs)
More or less She asked me to get the
lay of the land with the Cullens

Because well Im afraid Victoria
is quite put out with you

BELLA

Yes She feels its only fair to kill
Edwards mate given he killed hers
Eye for an eye mate for a mate

And now Bella knows Terror overwhelms her Edward appears --—

EDWARD

BELLA

eyes dart around escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward looking
at her with alarm

BELLA
(whispering barely
audible)
Edward I love you
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly his
expression changes He sees something in the forest behind
Bella - and it terrifies him

LAURENT
I dont believe it

He steps back Bellas confused as she realizes hes no
longer focused on her she follows his eyes slowly
turning to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the
woods It stalks towards them a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat sharp teeth gleaming

Bella is trapped between the two killers Edward whispers
in her ear --

EDWARD
Dont Move

The wolf slinks closer to Bella a mere twenty feet from where
she stands then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees flanking
the black wolf Theyre the size of small horses all of
different hues dark silver chocolate ash and russet-
brown Their hackles are up lips curling bodies crouched
ready to spring

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her The RUSSET-
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her Laurent
continues to retreat - then suddenly almost simultaneously --

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire surrounding
him before he reaches the treeline --

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf SMACKING the wolf
half-way across the meadow Another wolf lunges at Laurent -
he kicks it and it sails into a tree SPLINTERING it

The two wolves recover lurch back to the pack which closes
in on Laurent Its impossible to know who will prevail --
Bella doesnt stay to find out She RACES into the woods --

They look at one another Jacobs hand still on her face
his eyes searching hers

Slowly he starts to bend toward her lips She doesnt pull
away She misses him too much needs him too badly This
time shell let it happen A kiss is a centimeter away

Suddenly the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump
Jacob the closest to it doesnt move his face just keeps
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone answers --

Suddenly Jacobs eyes go wild his body stiffens starts
trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph

stands in doorway looking empty despairing Bella
immediately hurries to her side

males in their 20s FELIX huge strong and DEMETRI
slender elegant Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES

DEMETRI
We should take this conversation to a
more appropriate venue

EDWARD
Fine Bella why dont you stay and

follow Felix smirking gestures for them to go ahead of

him Edward takes Bellas hand

EXT VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY

Jane leads Edward Bella and Alice through several narrow

Bellas thoughts Fascinating

He releases Edwards hand and turns to Bella

I would love to see if you are an
exception to my gifts as well

He reaches for Bellas hand She hesitates does she have a
choice Aro laughs at her reluctance further extends his
hand Bella finally takes it

A beat as he holds her hand confusion sweeping over him

ARO
Interesting

He releases her moves back to his chair deep in thought

ARO
I wonder if --

EDWARD
(reading Aros thoughts)
No

ARO
Lets see if shes immune to all our
powers shall we Jane

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --
Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him

across the room where he collapses writhing in agony Jane
concentrates on him with a small smile enjoying his pain

BELLA
Stop
Bella and Alice rush to his side As soon as Jane looks
away Edwards pain ceases
ARO
Jane dear The girl

Janes gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes awaiting the
pain but nothing happens Janes grin is replaced by
anger Aro laughs like a child with a new toy

Jane infuriated moves toward Bella but Aro stops her with
a tiny gesture

ARO
Remarkable She confounds us all So
what do we do with you now

MARCUS
(seemingly bored)
You already know what youll do Aro

CAIUS
She knows too much shes a liability

ARO

Thats true Unless Edward intends to
give her immortality

(looks at Edward)
But thats not your intention is it
Shame

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella but he only takes a
step before Edward tackles him

BELLA

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back
which is no easy job As she struggles mightily --

Edward is David to Felixs Goliath Edward will lose but
hell go down fighting

-- Edward is fast anticipating Felixs moves before he
makes them but Felix is stronger --

-- Felix grabs Edward throws him into the ceiling SMASHING
against the marble he drops like a stone Is then
immediately KICKED across the room

Stop this Please

But Aro ignores her leans forward to study Edward Jane is
itching to step in Aro gestures her back

-- Felix takes some hits but then lifts Edward overhead
CRACKING him like a nut then flinging him against a wall --

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away
she flies HARD against the wall

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --

Bella bruised but not broken makes another attempt to get

to Aro -- finally reaches him kneels in front of him --
BELLA
Do it Kill me Just leave them
alone

-- as she yanks her collar back exposing her neck to him
Aro is surprised and intrigued A beat
Enough

Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro

EDWARD
Get away from her --

Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by
Janes invisible powers he writhes in agony Alice can no
longer bear Edwards suffering --

ALICE

EDWARD
(through gritted teeth)

Alice they cautiously back toward the door --

INT VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Demetri leads Bella Edward and Alice out of the hall
As they make their way up the corridor they see coming
toward them --

Go back to sleep Youve been through
a lot

BELLA
No you might --
EDWARD

Ill be here when you wake up
Beat she looks at him wary

BELLA
Why Out of guilt

EDWARD
(realizing)
You think I asked the Volturi to
kill me because I felt guilty
BELLA
Didnt you

EDWARD
I went to them because I thought Id
lost you

BELLA
You didnt even want me

Now Edward takes her by the shoulders

EDWARD
Bella The only reason I left was to
protect you I wanted you to have a
chance at a normal happy life

BELLA
But it was so easy for you to leave

EDWARD
I had to be convincing But easy In
my hundred years Ive never had a
harder time than what I just went
through

Shes beginning to believe him

BELLA
I kept seeing you Visions of you
Always protecting me I thought I was
going crazy

EDWARD
Your own instincts were speaking to
you I wish it had been me But
youre the heroic one You saved me

He moves to kiss her but abruptly stops Suddenly --

HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS
flip on and Charlie enters Edward is gone

CHARLIE
Last time you said that you

Edward sitting on the bed

EDWARD
He wont forgive me easily

BELLA

EDWARD

hope you will Because I honestly
have no idea how to live without you

Bella melts in his eyes He kisses her

BELLA
You wont be able to get rid of me

EDWARD
She wont have to There are ways to
keep the Volturi in the dark

BELLA
(pulling away)
Theyll come after your whole family
Youd risk that just to keep me human

EDWARD
Just You really dont understand
what youd be giving up

BELLA

He looks to her kisses her hand then suddenly Edward
SLAMS on the brakes --

THEIR POV - THE ROAD

-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --

its JACOB He glares then turns and walks into the woods

BELLA
What is he doing

EDWARD
He wants to talk to me

BELLA
Well he can talk to me first

She pushes out of the car --
INT WOODS - MORNING

Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree His expression is hard

JACOB
Youre still alive

BELLA

Ive been calling you
JACOB
Couldnt drop by

EDWARD
He thinks Im keeping you away

JACOB
(spinning on him)
Stay the hell out of my head

BELLA
Dad grounded me Jake Were trying
to get back before he wakes up

Jacob doesnt buy it Bella is frustrated But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob Calm Diplomatic

EDWARD
Jacob I know you have something to
say to me but Id like to say
something first Alright

Jacob leans back against the tree arms folded waiting

EDWARD
(sincere)
Thank you For keeping Bella alive
when I didnt
JACOB

No you didnt And it wasnt for
your benefit trust me

EDWARD
I know Im still grateful
(then)
But Im back now And Im not leaving
Bellas side till she orders me away

She looks at him He returns the look Jacob sees the
devotion between them It wounds him But he masks it

JACOB
Well see

EDWARD
Either way well handle Victoria from
here on out

JACOB
Shes been laying low Ever since
your freaky sister showed up Guess
she cant stand you Cullens either

EDWARD
Shell come back

JACOB

She does shes ours She killed on
our turf

EDWARD
Well see

JACOB
My turn to talk Im here to remind
you about a key point in the Treaty

EDWARD
(reads his thoughts nods)
I havent forgotten

JACOB
Good

BELLA
What What key point

JACOB
If any of them bites a human the
truce is over Thats bite not kill

BELLA
(realizing)
But if I choose it its none of
your business

Jacob is horrified starting to shake with rage

JACOB
If you what No No way I
wont let you --

EDWARD
-- Bella step back --

JACOB
Youre not gonna be one of them

BELLA
Thats not your call --

JACOB
(even more intense)
You know what well do to you - I
wont have a choice --
EDWARD
Were done here --

Edward takes Bellas arm starts to pull her away Jacob
lunges trying to extract Bella from him --

JACOB
You dont speak for her

Edward PUSHES Jacob away he flies back ten feet in the air
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF

-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance Edward shifts stance as well
readying for a fight --

BELLA
Stop

Edward and Jacob circle one another seconds from lunging --

EDWARD
(to Bella)
Get out of here Now

But Bella races between them forceful insistent

BELLA
(to both of them)
You do this youll be going through me

A long tense beat none of them backing down - it could go
either way --

BELLA
I swear to God Im not moving

Both rivals see shes dead serious Edward backs off ever-
so-slightly the Jacob-wolf does the same

BELLA
(turning to Edward)
Give me a second Please

Edward shakes his head Doesnt move an inch

BELLA
Read his thoughts Is he going to
hurt me
Edward does and finally reluctantly backs away But his
eyes never leave the wolfs They glare at one another

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf blocking his line
of sight Her voice is kind pleading

BELLA
Jacob I love you Youre my best
friend But I cant change how I

feel Please dont make me choose

(quietly emotionally)
Because itll be him Its always
been him

Anguish sweeps through the wolfs fierce face Its even
harder to take than when hes in human form --

BELLA
But you know how important you are to --

Suddenly the wolf BOLTS out of there
ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear

BELLA (V0O)
There were problems ahead Seemingly
insurmountable

Edwards arms wrap around her from behind
BELLA (V0O)
If I didnt become a vampire the
Volturi would kill me If I did my
best friend would do the job himself
or get killed in the attempt

She turns to face Edward looking into his loving eyes

BELLA (VO)
Victoria was still on the loose
putting everyone I loved in danger

He kisses her tenderly washing away her concerns

BELLA (V0O)
But Id already survived the worst --
losing Edward So I knew I could
survive anything
EDWARD

Im here Always
And she sees thats the truth believes it He takes her
hand and together they turn heading out of the woods

BELLA (V0O)

And soon Id be like him Wed face

our fate together Forever
Off them hand in hand inseparable as we begin to --

FADE TO BLACK

HEAR the agonized HOWL of a wolf in the far distance

THE END
