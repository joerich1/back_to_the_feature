A GENERAL NOTE ABOUT SCENE NUMBERING

The scene numbering in this script contains large blocks of “reserved” numbers for the
following reason

Every time we travel to a different time period (except for the 1985 prologue) the scene
numbers jump to a new 3-digit number as follows

1—7

8— 61
201 — 238
300 — 386
501 — 578
701 — 713

1985 Prologue

“Biff 198

This is intended to make breakdowns easier because simply by looking at a scene number
you can tell what time period we are in

MARTY

In 3 seconds the rain abruptly stops to be replaced by bright sunlight
DOC

the weather service

Doc and Marty throw open their gullwing doors

12 EXT ALLEY 12
As they get out of the DeLorean Doc peels plastic material off his face — as if removing a
disguise

Marty stares in disbelief

DOC
Excuse the disguise Marty but was afraid you wouldn’t
recognize me went to a rejuvenation clinic had ‘em take
some wrinkles out got a hairrepair — added a good 30 to 40
years to my life also had my spleen and colon replaced
What do you think

MARTY
You look good Doc Real good
(starts down the alley)
The future W hoa gotta check this out

DOC
All in good time Marty We’re on a tight schedule here
Here’re your clothes

Doc takes out a FUTURISTIC GYM BAG then goes around to get Jennifer out of the car

MARTY
So Doc like what about my future make it big right

DOC
Marty please that’s not why we’re here

MARTY
You can tell me Doc What am — like a rich rock star
DOC
Please Marty no one should know too much about their own
destiny
MARTY

(takes this as a “no”)
Okaywell at least I’m rich right

DOC

(sighs)
Damn Maybe shouldnt be doing this Maybe should just
forget this whole thing and take you both back home

MARTY
Hey I’m sorry Doc Im just excited that’s all Everybody
wants to know about their future

DOC
That’s what I’m afraid of
(sighs)
Well we’re here Let’s hope my plan works Change clothes
We’ve got a mission to accomplish

As Marty starts unbuttoning his shirt Doc lifts the unconscious JENNIFER out of the DeLorean
and puts her down in a doorway alcove behind a futuristic waste processing unit

MARTY
You mean were just gonna leave her

DOC
It’s too risky to take her with me Don’t worry shell be safe

She’s out of sight and itll just be for a few minutes

From his pocket Doc pulls out FUTURISTIC BINOCULARS — a thin plastic card with eye
lenses that looks like a cheap toy

Doc runs down to the opposite end of the alley and starts looking around for something
We INTERCUT Marty as he dons the future clothes

The shirt “buttons” with velcro

The jacket seems too big for Marty until he touches a pressure pad on the sleeve “Un-size
form fit” Instantly the sleeves automatically shorten and the jacket tailors its elf to Marty’s
body to his delight

Doc continues looking around intently through the binocs At last he focuses on something

DOC’S POV THRU BINOCULARS OF 13

the back of a young man’s head he’s wearing a FUTURISTIC YELLOW CAP (The binocular
matte includes digital readouts for distance tem perature etc)

DOC nods satisfied He hurries back to the DMC 14

Meanwhile MARTY can’t figure out how to “tie” his future (Nike) shoes He examines them
and touches a pad The shoe zip-laces itself shut

MARTY
Power laces All right

Marty is now fully dressed in future garb

MARTY
Okay Doc so whats the deal

DOC
In exactly 2 minutes you go around the corner into the “Cafe
80s”
MARTY
Cafe 80s
DOC

Its one of those nostalgia places but not done very well Go
in and order a Pepsi — here’s a fifty

Doc hands Marty a future 50-dollar bill with rainbow holographic borders
DOC
(continuing)

Then wait fora guy named “Griff”

MARTY
“Griff”

DOC
Right Griffs going to ask you about tonight — are you in or
out Tell him you’re out Whatever he says whatever
happens say no youre not interested Then leave come
back here and wait for me Don’t talk to anybody don’t touch
anything don’tdo anything don’tinteract with anyone

Doc rummages around in the DeLorean and pulls out a bag

MARTY
don’t get it Doc thought this has something to do with my
kids
DOC

Precisely In those clothes you’re the spitting image of your
future son — with one last finishing touch

From the bag Doc pulls a yellow cap identical to the one he saw a moment ago and puts it on
Marty’s head

DOC
Perfect
(his watch BEEPS)
Damn I’m late

Doc rushes back down the far end of the alley

MARTY
Doc wait Where you going

DOC
To intercept the real Marty Junior Youre taking his place

Doc disappears around the corner
Marty shrugs

MARTY
Marty Junior With a name like that how can he go wrong

He takes a deep breath and steps out of the alley onto
EXT HILL VALLEY COURTHOUSE SQUARE 2015 — DAY

Yes its COURTHOUSE SQUARE — familiar enough to recognize but vastly changedfor
the better

The streets are now GIGANTIC SIDEWALKS for pedestrians and bicycles only — no cars
which are restricted to ELEVATED STREETS (There are “No Parking” and “No Landing” signs
posted)

In the center the village green has been restored and improved with a DUCK POND anda
FOUNTAIN

The renovated COURTHOUSE is now the entrance to COURTHOUSE MALL boasting over
75 underground shops the CLOCKTOW ER has the same clock cleaned up restored and
preserved behind hermetically sealed plexiglass (it’s a tourist attraction) and still stopped at
1004

The TEXACO STATION is now a 2-LEVEL GAS STATION A car lands on the upper level and
a series of ROBOT ARMS immediately go to work washing the windshield and checking the
tires

A PLASTIC SURGERY FRANCHISE “Bottoms Up” advertising FACE LIFTS and a sale on
Breast Implants

A ROBOTICS SHOP displays robots and accessories (sales service rentals)

Billboards for “TWA Vietnam Vacations” “Pepsi Plus (it’s vitamin enriched)” and “GE
Superconductors”

A HOLOGRAPHIC THEATER playing “JAW S 14” (This time it’s really really pers onal)
directed by Max Spielberg

A VIDEO SOFTWARE STORE advertising the “Video Classic A Match Made in Space”
And the perennial FINANCE COMPANY offering Easy Credit some things never change

The people in general seem in better physical condition — few are fat or wear glasses
(although there are plenty of wild sunglasses and videoglasses)

There are Kids with painted faces — a contemporary fad

A group of HARE-KRISHNAS are chanting in the square

And PUBLIC UTILITY WORKERS are tearing up the street

MARTY stares wide-eyed taking it allin He walks past 16
AN ANTIQUE STORE in which the display window is filled with “RARE ANTIQUES” — 17
common household objects of the 1970s and 80s a Betamax Perrier bottles a Super-8

Movie camera a Macintosh computer mannequins with old clothes and aBOOK “SPORTS
ALMANAC 1950— 2000” (There’s also a sign “We buy antique coins and bills”)

MARTY spots the “CAFE 80’s” located where Lou’s Malt Shop was in 1955 18
He goes in
INT CAFE 80’S 19

Marty enters and looks around

The decor incorporates icons of the 1980S (“Baby On Board” signs “oldies” music Miami
Vice colors etc) The front portion is like a fast food operation pictorial menus above the
counter show various food items

There are “Watchman” type video screens for each seat Instead of waitresses there are
ROBOTDROIDS With VIDEO SCREEN heads behind the counter The screen flashes and
the face of RONALD REAGAN appears on it in a “Max Headroom” computer synthesized
image

DROID (VIDEO)
Welcome to Cafe 80S where it’s always Morning in America
— even in the afternoon

The “Morning In America” cam paign commercial plays behind “Reagan”

Marty stares in amazement taken aback by the startling technology
DROID (REAGAN)
Our special today is Mesquite grilled sushi cajun style dipped
in a Thai cilantro sauce

Suddenly the image becomes AYATOLLAH KHOMENI

DROID (KHOMENI)
No It is the Great Satan Special demand you have Tofu

(becomes MICHAEL JACKSON)
Hey Be cool Don’t be bad We’re allfriends here

MARTY
Uh could havea Pepsi

Marty holds up his Fifty

DROID (REAGAN)
Cash Well it’s much easier to just use your thumb

MARTY
Huh Uh no Ill pay cash

DROID (REAGAN)

Well there’s a handling surcharge on cash but well okay
well take cash

Marty puts the bill down on a tray on the counter Its sucked into a machine There are some
electronic sounds some whirring noises and then a PEPSI PERFECT in a futuristic container

is dispensed via the food delivery system

DROID (REAGAN)
And your change rounded off to the nearest dollar

Two 1 -dollar bills come out of the unit

Marty takes his change He takes the Pepsi and examines it He can’t figure out how to open
it

VOICE (0S)
Hey McFly

The voice and tone are familiar — too familiar Marty turns

MARTY
Biff

Yes its BIFF TANNEN 78 years old white hair craggy features He’s at atable eating sushi
and watching a SPORTS EVENT on his watchman screen Biff gives him a look and nods
knowingly

Marty approaches him staring in disbelief at his aged features

BIFF
Yeah I’ve seen you around You’re Marty McFly’s kid huh

MARTY
Huh What
BIFF
Marty Junior You look like him too Tough break kid it must
be rough being named after a complete butthead

MARTY
What’s that supposed to mean

Biff takes his CANE — the top is a sculpted CLENC HED FIST — and knocks it on Marty’s
forehead

BIFF
Hello Anybody home Think McFly think Your old man
Mr Loser
MARTY
What A loser
BIFF

That’s right A loser with a capital “L”

MARTY
That can’t be happen to know that George McFly is no
longer a loser

Outside through the window a beat up ‘89 BMW Convertible Hover conversion pulls up to the
cafe with 4 GUYS in it The vehicle parks and the guys get out

BIFF
No George McFly’s never been a loser But I’m not talking
about George McFly I’m talking about his kid — your old
man Marty McFly Senior
(a beat as Biff shakes his head)
He just took his life and flushed it com pletely down the toilet

Marty stands there in stunned shock

MARTY
M-m -me Marty

Now a KID 19 who bears a startling resemblance to Biff steps in

KID
Hey Gramps told you two coats of wax on my car not just
one

BIFF

Hey just put the 2nd coaton last week

KID
Yeah with your eyes closed Come out here and scan it It’sa
lo-res job

Marty looks back and forth between the two in amazement

MARTY
Uh are you two related

Again Biff knocks on Marty’s head with his cane
BIFF
Hello Anybody home Whaddaya think Griff just calls me
grandpa for his health

Marty looks at Biffs grandson with an “oh shit’ reaction

MARTY
Hes Griff

GRIFF
Gramps nuke the bab-sesh and get out here ‘orrita What

(to Marty)
And McFly don’t go anywhere Youre next

Biff heads for the door
BIFF

Listen Griff don’t you go loanin’ that McFly kid any money —

even though he probably needs ithim and his old man both
Biff exits leaving Marty dumbfounded
Marty watches through the window as Griff points out to Biff some problem with the finish on
his beat up junker Also present are Griff’s gang a girland 2 guys SPIKE WHITEY and
HACK
Ona VIDEO SCREEN a Rock Video “Oldie” comes on “Power of Love”
Marty watches and nods to the beat

3 nearby GIRLS about 13 shake their heads

GIRL 1
Oh shred that only scan that kinda vid at my grandma’s

GIRL 2
Yeah what do they call it Rock and rail

GIRL 3
It doesn’t even sound like music

GIRL 1
Yeah thank God we didn’t have to live in the 80’s It must
have been terrible

Marty feels very old

Nearby is an ARCADE VIDEO GAME from the 80’s “GUN FIGHT ER” It’s one of those where
you shoot a light gun at the video screen A KID about 8 is looking at it He can’t figure it out

KID
How do you play this thing

MARTY
Ill show you kid I’m a crack shot at this one Where do you
put in the quarter
KID
Quarter What’s a quarter

Marty touches his thumb to a thumbplate where the money would normally go and the game
starts up So that’s how you “use your thumb”

Marty zaps every target no sweat He’s a crack shot

KID
You mean you have to use your hands That’s like a baby
toy

Marty really feels old

Marty takes a few more shots the REAL MARTY JUNIOR passes by out the window on his
way into the cafe He’s unnoticed by Griff Biff and the boys who are absorbed in the car

MARTY sees him coming He’s horrified

MARTY
Damn

Marty runs behind the counter and ducks down hiding

JUNIOR enters

Marty gets a good look at his future son

JUNIOR 17 although dressed like Marty carries himself quite differently Ina word he’sa
mess his jacket doesn’t fit right (the uni-fit system is broken) he has food stains all over him
and unkempt hair sticks out of his yellow cap He’s a combination of Marty’s looks with the

pers onality of young George McFly

DROID (REAGAN)
Welcome to Cafe 80’s where its always—

JUNIOR
Pepsi Perfect

Junior pays for it by putting his thumb to a thum bplate device on the counter and the delivery
unit dispenses a Pepsi

Now GRIFF and the GUYS enter

GRIFF
Hey McFly

Junior turns and smiles weakly

JUNIOR
Hi Griff guys How’s it going

GRIFF
Hey McFly your shoe’s unvelked

Junior falls for it Griff slaps him and he and his boys all laugh Junior laughs too

Marty winces at the humiliation
GRIFF
So McFly have you made your decision ab out tonights
little op portu nity

Marty reacts with increased concern

JUNIOR
Uh well I’m still not sure Seems kinda dangerous

SPIKE
What’s wrong You got no scroat

GRIFF

JUNIOR
Well don’t really think should but guess should discuss
it with my fath—

GRIFF

Are you saying “no” McFly

JUNIOR
Uh well yes That is I’m saying “no thank you”

Marty sighs relief

GRIFF
Wrong answer McFly

As he says it Griff picks up Marty Junior and THROWS HIM OVER THE COUNTER right next
to where Marty is hiding

The guys alllaugh

Some of the patrons react with concern some make phone calls on their wrist or headgear
phones to 911

DROID (REAGAN)
Now now lets behave ourselves

MARTY stares at his unconscious future son lying there

Marty takes a deep breath and stands up Griff grabs him by the jacket and pulls him over the
counter

GRIFF
Now let’s hear the right answer or you’re gonna get a
knuckle brioche

Marty shoves Griff and clenches a fist about to throw a punch
Griff and the guys react with surprise at such unusual behavior for Marty Junior
GRIFF
Well well well since when did you become the physical

type

Marty remembers who he’s supposed to be and unclenches his fist
MARTY
Look Griff the answer’s “no”

GRIFF
No
MARTY
N-O
Marty turns around and starts for the door
GRIFF

What’s wrong McFly Chicken

Marty stops just before he reaches the door His body tenses his face tightens his anger
rises

SPIKE

HACK
(pulls Marty’s yellow hat off)
Sure why dya think he wears yellow

Marty is seething

MARTY
What did you call me Griff

GRIFF
Chicken McFly
Griff and the guys make “clucking” sounds
Marty tums around with resolve
MARTY

Nobody calls me chicken

Griff picks up a plate from the table and hurls it at Marty Marty dodges it Griff charges him
then Marty trips Griff

Griff falls to the floor

There’s a moment of stunned silence from Griff’s boys This is clearly uncharacteristic
behavior for Marty Junior

Griff gets back on his feet and rises in front of Marty slowly standing to his full height

GRIFF
All right punk you’ve been looking for—

MARTY
Hey — look

Griff falls for it and turns and Marty throws a punch but Griff raises his arm and blocks it

A beat then Marty knees him in the groin
20-24

26-A

Griff wails in pain and drops to his knees

Marty runs for it ramming into Griffs gang who fall down like dominoes

Marty bolts out of the cafe

OMITTED 20-24
EXT CAFE 80S — DAY 25
Marty runs past Biff who is doing some work on Griff’s car
MARTY spots TWO GIRLS behind the hedge apparently on kiddie skateboard-scooters 26

MARTY jumps over the hedge and grabs one of ‘em pulling off the detachable scooter handle
and converting it into a skateboard

MARTY
Hey kid need your—

Marty stops short as he examines the pink board there’s aloop strap for one foot but it has
NO WHEELS

Its brand name “(----- ) HOVERBOARD”

MARTY
Hoverboard

He throws it down and it hovers a few inches above the ground

MARTY
All right

Marty hops on it and kicks itup to speed it functions just like a skateboard He glides
diagonally into the square along the path that juts out into the pond

EXT CAFE 26-A
Now GRIFF and the GANG come running out of the cafe
They spot Marty hoverboarding out toward the pond

GRIFF
There he is Hey McFly Youre a dead file

Marty looks back at them and just smiles confident that he’s escaped
BIFF watching scratches his head as memories return 27

BIFF
There’s something fam iliar about all this

EXT TOWN SQUARE 28

Griff and the guys run to Griffs BMW and pull4 HOVERBOARDS from the back seat wicked
looking models that look a whole lot faster than Martys

Marty quits gloating and gets moving The path he’s on ends as an island in the pond Marty
cuts sideways and continues OVER the water toward the COURT HOUSE — but the board
slows then stops
He’s stalled above the pond 15 feet from the edge Marty looks behind him
HACK
McFly you bojo those boards don’t work on water — unless

you’ve got power

Griff pulls out the MEANEST LOOKING HOVERBOARD in existence THE PIT BULL it’s
powered with 2 jets its got fins and has spikes around it — it resembles a chain saw

Griff throws it down It hums and hovers to life with an electronic GROWL

Griff hops on it and does the hoverboard version of a wheelie just to show off how skilled he
is

Marty reacts with fear He tries to kick off the water He almost falls off — it’s like balancing on
a log

Griff smiles sadistically at the helpless Marty Now Spike Whitey and Hack fall in behind Griff

GRIFF
Hook on

The guys pull tow lines out from the back of Griff’s board
Griff whips outa collapsible BASEBALL BAT

GRIFF
I’m gonna take his head off

Griff kicks his foot against the engine He accelerates forward towing his boys behind him
Again Marty tries to paddle with his foot to no avail
Griff raises the bat and takes a batters stance

The guys fan out behind Griff cackling sadistically Marty panicked turns and sees Griff and
the guys bearing down on him

Griff goes into his backswing
Marty is petrified
Griff starts his swing

Then Marty pulls his footfrom the strap and simply STEPS OFF THE HOVERBOARD AND
DROPS INTO THE POND

As Marty’s head hits the water Griff’s board whizzes across missing him by millimeters

Griff cant stop his swing — he loses his balance in his follow-thru causing himself and the
guys to go flying wildly and completely out of control at the Courthouse

2 guys are knocked into columns one goes through the door and another through a window
ALARMS go off

Marty comes up from underwater as the 3 empty hoverboards of Griff’s guys drop to a hover
nearby

UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS come rushing out of the Courthouse to apprehend the
punks

Marty sighs in relief at his escape He paddles ashore with the little girl’s pink board
He climbs out and spots the little girl and hands back her board

MARTY
Thanks a lot kid

LITTLE GIRL
Keep it Ive got a Pit Bull now

Indeed she has Griffs board and she hovers away on it

As Marty walks off with the pink hoverboard his JACKET PUFFS UP WITH AIR the “Drying
Mode” Hot air even blows his face from the collar In seconds the jacket’s completely dry

OMITTED 29
EXT TOWN SQUARE — DAY 30
MARTY sighs in relief at his escape

He tucks the hoverboard under his arm and starts walking back across the square toward the
alley

Behind him a MAN is walking around with a portable THUMB UNIT soliciting

MAN
Save the clock tower Save the clock tower

Marty passes a large DIAMOND VISION screen which shows a com puter graphic
“SportsFlash” of some BASEBALL FOOTAGE and the headline

“CUBS SWEEP MIAMI IN WORLD SERIES”
Marty can’t believe what he’s seeing

MARTY
The Cubs win the World Series Against Miami

The Clocktower Man next to him shakes his head sympathetically

MAN
Yeah a hundred-to-one shot Who woulda thought Sure
wish could go back in time and lay some bets on them
Cubbies

MARTY
No just meant that Miami—
(sudden realization)

What did you just say

He smiles and looks back at OLD BIFF who is still polishing Griffs BMW

MARTY
A loser am

Marty puts the Almanac back in the silver bag along with the receipt and toward the alley
OMITTED 31-32
OLD BIFF glances up from the car and gives Marty a look 32-A

As Old Biff turns his attention back to the BMW he sees THE REAL MARTY JUNIOR coming
out of Cafe 80s

Old Biff does a double-take looks back over at Marty then again at Marty Junior who hurries
off in another direction never noticing Old Biff or Marty

OLD BIFF
What the hell Two of ‘em

Old Biff is suspicious He moves cautiously toward Marty

MARTY turns the corner into the ALLEY only to stop short because POLICE VEHICLE is on 33

newspaper just went forward a day to find out if you were

succes sful
MARTY
But this is awful
DOC
(nods)

It gets worse As a result of this your daughter goes into a
state of severe depression and commits—

MARTY
My daughter have a daughter What does she do

DOC
Never mind — you know too much already It’s all my fault
just assumed if we could get your son to say no to those

guys

MARTY
Doc he did say no And just as he was gonna change his
mind that’s when got into it wonder if it says anything
about—

Marty takes another look at the newspaper this time his eyes nearly bug out of his head

MARTY
Doc what did this headline say

DOC
“Local Youth Jailed In Attempted Theft”

MARTY
Well look again

It now says “LOCAL YOUTHS JAILED FOR RECKLESS HO VERBOARDING” Below are
pictures of GRIFF and the gang but not Marty Junior Theres also a picture of some property

damage to the Courthouse

DOC looks at the story and pictures then looks at the Courthouse at the actual property
damage He pulls out the CARD BINOCULARS

POV THRU BINOCULARS 36-A

An AUTOMATED DROID FAX-CAM PHOTOGRAPHER (with the newspaper logo on it) flies
down lands and takes the very picture that will appear in this newspaper

BACK TO SHOT 36-B

Suddenly Doc has a revelation
DOC
Of course The ripple effect Time travel into the future is
always the extrapolation of current events of the immediate
present In my case left this time at a moment before this
hoverboard incident took place — yet returned after it
occurred Just as the present affects the future the future
reverberates back into the past

And because this hoverboard incident has now occurred Griff
now goes to jail therefore your son wont go with him tonight
and this robbery will never take place And that’s why the
newspaper is now altered

MARTY
Kinda like that picture of me and Dave and Linda that kept
disappearing back in 1955

DOC
Precisely Marty we’ve succeeded Not exactly as planned
but no matter mission accomplished Lets get Jennifer and
go home

MARTY
Thats just it Doc — the police took her away

DOC
Great Scott are you sure

MARTY
About a minute before found you

DOC
Damn Those cops were the reason didn’t land the
DeLorean here Some of the modifications I’ve made on it
arent exactly street legal

Doc uses a WRIST REMOTE CONTROL UNIT to pilot the DeLorean down from behind a
building

EXT NEARBY ON THE STREET 37
OLD BIFF has been watching Marty and Doc and now sees the DELOREAN descending

BIFF
A flying DeLorean haven’t seen one of those in 30 years

Suddenly Biff’s face lights with recognition — as he realizes that he’s seen it before His eyes
narrow with suspicion

EXT TOWN SQUARE — DOC AND MARTY 38

Doc continues piloting with the wrist remote Once the DMC lands Doc uses the FUTABA
REMOTE CONTROL UNIT (from Twin Pines Mall) to drive the car over to them

MARTY
think the cops said they were gonna take her home

DOC
Home Great Scott If anyone’s home who recognizes her —
you or your family and they traumatize her or worse if
Jennifer actually encounters her future self the
consequences could be disastrous

MARTY
What do you mean

DOC

The shock of coming face to face with oneself 30 years older
is enough to traum atize anyone She would probably go into
shock — her heart could stop she could drop dead and that
would create a time paradox which would unravel the very
fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire
Universe

(a beat)
Granted thats the worst case scenario The destruction
might in fact be very localized limited to merely our own
galaxy

MARTY
(laughs uncom forta bly)
Oh hey well that’s a relief

Doc brings the DeLorean over to them

DOC
(notices Marty’s silver bag)
What’s in that bag

MARTY
This Oh nothing just a souvenir a book that looks like it
might be interesting

Doc takes it opens it and pulls out the book

DOC
“50 Years of Sports statistics” Hardly recreational reading
material Marty

MARTY
Okay well figured it couldn’t hurt to bring back a little info on
the future you know in case of a cash flow problem Id place
a few bets

DOC
Marty didn’t invent time travel for financial gain

BIFF is eavesdropping behind them and he reacts to this

BIFF
Time travel
ON DOC AND MARTY
DOC
(contd)

The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of hum anity

MM

where we’ve been where we’re going the pitfalls and the
possibilities the perils and the promise perhaps even an
answer to that universal question Why

MARTY

Oh hey Im all forthat Doc but what’s wrong with making a
few bucks on the side

DOC
Because the risks far outweigh any potential rewards

Doc puts the book back inthe bag and tosses it into a nearby trash receptacle
Marty sighs with disappointment as he sees his scheme of wealth lost
Doc opens his gullwing door EINSTEIN Doc’s dog is in the car

DOC
Move over Einstein

MARTY
Einie Where’d you come from boy

Doc and Marty still with the hoverboard climb into the DeLorean with the dog
DOC
Id left him here in a suspended animation kennel when went
back to 1985 to bring you here Einstein never knew was
gone Well be home soon boy Just sit tight
They take off
ANGLE — TRASH CONTAINER 41

The silver bag with the Sports Book sits in the trash container Now a pair of hands rescue it
BIFF’S HANDS

BIFF examines the book with a sinister smile then looks up at the departing DeLorean

BIFF
So Doc Brown invented a time machine

He spots a TAXI nearby discharging a fare Biff waves his cane and goes over to it

Beyond a Sign “Hilldale” stretches a sprawl of identical cluster townhouses Originally built in

the 1980s as a “classy” yuppie development the place is showing its seams

The FLYING POLICE CAR lands and drives into the development

REESE and FOLEY are carrying the still unconscious JENNIFER to the front door

Jennifer starts to revive She’s groggy and disoriented

opens

COMPU-VOICE
Welcome home Jennifer

The cops help her inside
INT LIVING ROOM 44
They enter the darkened room

REESE

Ma’am you should reprogram It’s dangerous to enter without
lights on
JENNIFER
Lights on

In response to her words LIGHTS automatically come on

The room is furnished mostly with a lot of (old) items from the late ‘80s or early ‘90s — but
there are some more radical objects as well

The police put Jennifer down onthe sofa She’s still not all here

REESE
Just take iteasy and youll be fine And you be careful in the
future
JENNIFER
The future
The cops head for the door
FOLEY
So long Mrs McFly
JENNIFER

So long
They exit and the door automatically closes behind them
Suddenly Jennifer sits up in disbelief

JENNIFER
Mrs McFly

She looks around the room

There’s a window showing the grounds of a large estate outside — manicured lawn gardens
gazebo The image seems a bit surreal because its DAYTIME

STAIRS go up

Jennifer goes to a bookcase and browses On the shelf are a row of VID-BOOKS (a format yet
to be invented) There is a prerecorded copy of “A MATCH MADE IN SPACE” The other titles
are handwritten and include

“Wedding — Jennifer and Marty”

“Family Vacations — 1995— 2005”

“George and Lorraine 50th Anniversary”

“The Kids Marty Jr and Marlene — Vol 1 2 3”

She takes the one labeled “wedding” and opens it Inside the cover is an LCD screen which
starts playing back video tape of Marty and Jennifer walking down the aisle

JENNIFER
Oh my God

In response aGIRL’S VOICE calls down from upstairs

MARLENE (OS)
Mom Is that you

The voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JENNIFER’S
Jennifer reacts with alarm

JENNIFER
(to herself)
I’ve gotta get out of here

Jennifer quickly puts the vid-book back on the shelf and runs for the front door She can’t
figure out how to open it— there’s no door knob

Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS
Now FOOT STEPS from upstairs and a SHADOW

MARLENE (OS)
Mom Mom

Jennifer hides in the front closet and closes the louvered door She can see out of it Her jaw
drops and her eyes go wide as she sees

MARLENE McFLY 17 who looks like

Well if Marty was a gin this might be her Big breasts and somewhat chunky she looks like
she overdid it on the weight training (She does have her mother’s hair though)

Marlene pushes the thumb pad by the front door itopens
ON JENNIFER watching from closet 45

MARLENE (OS)
Oh hi Grandma Lorraine

OLD LORRAINE (0S)
Hi sweetheart brought dinner Are your folks home yet

MARLENE (OS)
Mom should be home any minute Dad — who knows

JENNIFER
(realizes who this means)
“Mom”

JENNIFERS POWV 46
of the activity at the front door OLD LORRAINE 77 has a bagpackage of future take-out
food

MARLENE
Grandpa You threw your back out again

Indeed OLD GEORGE 77 ENTERS UPSIDE DOWN in a futuristic HARNESS The brand
name Ortho-lev

OLD GEORGE
Yes playing slam ball

Both Lorraine and George have white hair and more wrinkles but generally look healthy
MARLENE
Ill take care of this Grandma

Marlene takes the food from Lorraine and goes to the kitchen

Lorraine looks at the window with the estate view the IMAGE ROLLS — a vertical hold
problem There’s also video tearing at the top

OLD LORRAINE
Look this window’s still broken

Lorraine picks up a remote control unit and operates it

The window image changes to the SOUTH SEAS then to the SWISS ALPS then to NEW
YORK CITY at night Finally the image goes off and the REAL window view appears — the
side of the neighbor’s townhouse with garbage cans

OLD GEORGE
Maybe we should buy them anew one Wecan afford it

JENNIFER cautiously opens the closet door

OLD LORRAINE
No George Marty would take that as an insult He’d think you
were reminding him that he can’t afford it

OLD GEORGE
just want to help out

OLD LORRAINE
Well you know Marty He’s always so overly concerned about
what people think about him what they say about him behind
his back How many times have we heard it “Mom can’t let
‘em think I’m cheap can’t let ’em think I’m not with it”

OLD GEORGE
“ can’tlet ‘em think I’m chicken”

They exchange a look

Jennifer spots FRENCH DOORS in the DEN at the opposite end of the house She steps out
of the closet and cautiously creeps that way being careful to stay out of view of Lorraine and
George

OLD LORRAINE
George that accident with the Rolls Royce was 30 years ago

OLD GEORGE
And Marty hasnt learned a thing He still won’t admit that the
whole thing was his own fault If Marty had just used a little
common sense that accident would have never happened
That accident started a chain reaction that sent Marty’s life
straight down the toilet

OLD LORRAINE
You’re right The man in that Roll Royce wouldnt have
pressed charges or sued him Marty wouldnt have broken his
hand he wouldn’t given up on his music
OLD GEORGE
And Marty wouldn’t have spent all those years feeling sorry for
himself complaining how life gave him sucha rawdeal He
just gave up

OLD LORRAINE
Youre right George If not for that accident Marty probably
would have made something of himself

Now MARTY JUNIOR comes running down the stairs
Jennifer tenses concerned — she’s right outin the open
Junior runs right past her not even looking at her

JUNIOR
Hi Mom

Junior goes into the Den

COMPU-V OICE (VO)
Welcome home Marty oh master of the house King of the
castle Lord of the manor

Jennifer reacts witha “you gotta be kidding” expression Then realizing she’s still out in the
open she darts thru an open door into tte BATHROOM

She closes the door leaving it open enough to peek out The front door opens and there’s
OLD MARTY 47 greying a little tired but still good looking He wears a future business suit

OLD MARTY
Hi everybody Im home
Aw Dad you threw your back out again I really think you
should get that spine operation

OLD GEORGE
know Know but who’s got 3 extra hours to spend at the
hos pital

OLD LORRAINE
How are things at work Marty

OLD MARTY
Oh same old same old

JENNIFER notices another door in the bathroom She looks through it and sees the DEN
where MARTY JUNIOR is watching 8 DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT ONCE on a LARGE
VIDEO WALL SCREEN — which sits slightly crooked on the wall

OLD MARTY
Junior dinner time

MARTY JUNIOR
But I’m watching TV

OLD MARTY
Well get your glasses We eat at the table when your
grandparents are here

MARTY JUNIOR
Aw Dad can only watch 2 shows at once on my glasses

Old Marty straightens out the tilted screen
OLD MARTY
Yeah you kids really have it tough When was your age if I
wanted to watch 2 shows at once had to put 2 sets next to
each other

The Hydrator beeps Lorraine opens it and pulls out a beautiful steaming 15-inch pizza

OLD MARTY

Old Lorraine serves the pizza

Marty Junior and Marlene are both wearing video glasses The glasses are opaque from the
outside with LCD readouts showing what channel the viewer is watching

Juniors readout says “ESPN — Ch 211-D” It’s a football game and Junior reacts to it
YELLING “Fumble can’t believe it Take him outta the game” etc

OLD LORRAINE

digestion to eat while youre inverted

Old George pushes a controlon his harness which turns him right side up

JENNIFER who can see the family from the bathroom goes through the 2nd bathroom door
into the den and creeps toward the French Doors

OLD MARTY

What if “the Jits” is monitoring

NEEDLES (VIDEO)
“The Jitsll” never find out Come on just stick your card in the
slot and Illhandle it Unless you want everyone in the division
to think you’re chicken

Marty’s blood rises He tenses up

OLD MARTY
Nobody calls me chicken

NEEDLES (VIDEO)
All right prove it
Marty defiantly takes out a CARD with BAR CODES and holds it up for Needles to see Marty
then inserts it in a slot next to the screen

OLD MARTY
Here Scan it I’m in

We hear an ELECTRONIC TONE then Marty withdraws the card

NEEDLES
Thanks McFly See you at the plant tomorrow

The screen blanks As Marty turns to leave the room there are some electronic tones anda
new image breaks in on the conversation MR FUJITSU a Japanese man in his early 30s

FUJITSU (VIDEO)

Marty tums — he’s surprised and concerned

OLD MARTY

FUJITSU (VIDEO)

The screen suddenly goes to a giant display of a piece of company stationary addressed to
Marty which says in big block letters “YOU’RE FIRED

Simultaneously a copy comes out of the FAX UNIT in Martys den

An identical copy comes out in the Fax machine in the bathroom (There’s a fax machine in
every room) Jennifer pulls it out and looks at it in amazement

Fujitsu “hangs up” His image disappears and a “painting” appears the “Art Channel” (which
broadcasts ever changing images of famous paintings)

Old Marty stares at his copy of the fax in disbelief

misused and why the time machine must be destroyed after

Right We’ve gotta go back to the future and stop Biff from
ever stealing the time machine

We can’t — because if we travelinto the future from this point

wealthy and married to your mother and in which this has

approaching figure moves closer evoking the feeling of impending doom

Marty pulls out the 1973 Newspaper

The headline “GEORGE McFLY MURDERED” dissolves and becomes “GEORGE McFLY

got a letter for you

He opens his briefcase and pulls outa CLIPBOARD and an ANCIENT YELLOWED
ENVELOPE sealed with a WAX SEAL

MARTY
A letter That’s impossible Who are you anyway

TRENCHCOAT
I’m from western Union and actually a bunch ofus in the
office were hoping you could shed some light on the subject
You see this envelope’s been in our company’s possession
for almost 70 years Itwas given to us with explicit instructions
that it be delivered to a young man with your description
answering to the name of Marty at this exact location at this
exact minute on November 12 1955 We had a bet going as
to whether this “Marty’ would actually be here Looks like
lost

MARTY
Did you say 70 years

TRENCHCOAT
Uh 67 to be exact Sign on line 6 please

He hands Marty the clipboard and pen Marty signs then hands it back The man gives Marty
the aged envelope

end to check the signature

happily in the year 1888 these past few months”

LIGHTNING strikes the clocktower
The DOC BROWN of 1955 (‘55 DOC) connects the cables

The DeLorean hook engages the line sending 121 jigowatts of electricity into the flux
capacitor and the time vehicle vanishes into the future

Trails of FIRE are left behind

(reads)

“The lightning bolt caused a jigowatt overload which activated
the flux capacitor sending me back to 1888 Upon landing
bottomed out the car destroying the drive train and flying
circuits making it impossible to get the car up to 88 under its
own power Luckily realized that a locomotive could push it
up to speed and devised a plan to do so”

Push it with a steam locomotive Brilliant Absolutely brilliant

“Unfortunately the lightning had also shorted out the enclosed
destination time circuit microchip”

Doc pulls a partially blackened 1-inch square microchip from the envelope

‘65 DOC
(reads)
“Without it could not control my destination time was
unable to repair it because suitable replacement parts will not
be invented until 1947”

I’m sorry Doc It’s all my fault You were there waiting could
have run from Biff But let him get to me And now you’re
stuck in the west

‘65 DOC

Stuck No Marty this sounds like a wonderful way to spend
my retirement years Why ever since was a boy wanted to
be a cowboy used to spend summers at my Uncle’s ranch
Uncle Abraham taught me how to ride and shoot and rope
He used to say to my parents “Young Emmett belongs in the
fresh air and wide open spaces not in a school room”

MARTY
So how’d you end up as a Scientist

‘65 DOC
Well when was eleven read a book by the most visionary
author in the world Jules Verne “20000 Leagues Under the
Sea” And discovered SCIENCE That’s when decided
what my future had to be Jules Verne’s novels had a
profound effect on me You know really should put his
portrait up there with Tom Ben Isaac and Albert

MARTY
Keep reading Doc

‘65 DOC

(reads)
“Therefore have buried the time machine in the abandoned
Delgado mine adjacent to the Oak Park Cemetery as shown
on the enclosed map Hopefully it should remain undisturbed
until you uncover it in 1955

“Inside you will find repair instructions My 1955 counterpart”
— Thats me — should have no problem making the
electrical repairs Then he’ll have to push the time vehicle up
to 88 and send you back to 1985 Then Marty destroy the
time machine

“Do not repeat do NOT attempt to come back here to get
me am perfectly happy living here in the fresh air and wide
open spaces I’ve even met a wonderful woman I’m
considering settling down with”

(amazed)
A woman I’ve found a woman Amazing

MARTY
Yeah youd been talking about finding a woman although
you made it sound like it was gonna be a scientific
investigation

‘65 DOC
Man cannot live by science alone A woman This is
wonderful news certainly hope she likes Jules Verne

“These are my wishes please respect them and follow them
And so Marty now say farewell and wish you Godspeed
You have been a good kind and loyal friend to me and

The COURTHOUSE is just starting construction there are the MARBLE PILLARS and some
very rough framing

There’s aSALOON (roughly in the location that the cafe will be)a BLACKSMITH STABLES

Immediately people clear the street running into buildings or running around the corner
Shopkeepers slam their doors and windows

BLACK BIFF
said DANCE

Black Biff fires a shot right in front of Marty’s feet then another

Marty starts dancing — first a few hops to the delight of Biff and the boys then Marty goes
into a Michael Jackson style moonwalk as he mumbles the lyrics to “Billie Jean”

Biff and the guys trade looks at this bizarre style of dancing

Marty suddenly twirls around with a jump and a yell The sudden action SPOOKS BIFF’S
HORSE who neighs and bucks throwing Biff into some MANURE in the street

Black Biff looks at the dung on him He looks at Marty with fire in his eyes — his expression is
almost psychotic

Biff’s cronies tense up There’s going to be some serious trouble
Marty knows it too but he’s too petrified to run Biff gets to his feet

BLACK BIFF
Buck gimme a rope

Buck throws him a coil of rope

MARTY
What are you gonna do
BLACK BIFF
Im gonna make you taller shorty

Black Biff throws the rope around Marty’s neck jumps on his horse and starts off down the
street

Marty runs behind him trying to keep up while trying to get the noose off his neck but he can’t
run fast enough He stumbles and is dragged around the square Black Biff laughs and yells
and his boys do likewise

Townspeople come out to see whats going on
Black Biff guides his horse into the grassy square
He throws the rope over an overhanging tree branch and pulls

Marty strug gles but he can’t free himself He’s pulled to his feet and then up off the ground all
the time grabbing at the rope to keep from choking

Black Biff and gang are laughing having a great time watching Marty struggle
Suddenly another SHOT RINGS OUT and the rope above Marty is severed
Marty falls to the ground

Black Biff and gang turn in the direction of the shot

DOC BROWN is holding a WINCHESTER repeater modified with a TELESCOPIC SIGHT that
looks like something out of Jules Verne His hair is slicked down and he’s wearing the garb of
a western BLACKSMITH

RAILROAD HANDCAR WHEELS

DOC
Amazing This tube contraption is precisely as envisioned it
Then again built it didn’t If only Id had some of these
parts when crashed was actually trying to construct a
steam operated flux capacitor Speaking of parts

Doc opens acabinet and pulls out a crate full of various odds and ends from the adventures in
time the PINK HOVERBOARD

DOC
We’d better be sure to bring this back with us
(pulls out a 1985 walkie-talkie)
And this well need to communicate tomorrow you have the
other one

MARTY
In the car So Doc how’s this train thing going to work

DOC
Ill show you constructed this model a few weeks ago when
thought could still get back
Marty follows Doc into a 2nd room where Doc removes a CANVAS COVER from a large table
revealing a home made table top model — a combination of toys wooden blocks a wind-up
toy train and other odds and ends

MARTY
Wow you went to a lot of trouble

DOC
Well you know how it is with model trains Besides the kids
around here love it

Now in order to get a steam locomotive up to 88 we need a
long stretch of track on a downhill grade which still exists in
1985 That’s here — Carson Spur which goes off the main
line atthis switch track and outto Carson Ravine Well load
the DeLorean onto the tracks here on Carson Spur The train
leaves the station at 757 tomorrow morning

MARTY
Whew I’m glad it’s before 8

DOC
Indeed So well hijack — uh borrow the train uncouple the
cars from the tender throw the switch track and then well
butt the locomotive against the DeLorean You’llget in the
DeLorean while run the steam engine pushing the
DeLorean along Carson Spur Ill open up the throttle putting
her into a full highball climb to the front of the locomotive
jump onto the DeLorean and getin in time to reach 88 miles
per hour at which time Mr Fusion will kick on the flux
capacitor generating the traditional 121 jigowatts which will
send us back to 1985

MARTY
Whats that red x on the windmill

DOC
That’s our failsafe point — the point of no return Up until
there we still have enough time to stop the locomotive before
it plunges into the ravine But once we pass that windmill it’s
the future or bust

MARTY
Into the ravine You mean there’s no bridge

DOC
They just started building itlast month and it wont be
com pleted until next year But it still exists in 1985 safe and in
use So as long as we hit 88 miles an hour before we reach
the edge of the ravine we’llinstantaneously arrive ata point
in time when the bridge is completed well have track under
us and coast safely across the gorge putting us right near the
Hill Valley Airport

MARTY
What about the locomotive

Doc winds up the toy locomotive and sets it on the tracks it pushes the wooden model

back to the year 1985

She stares at him for a long moment then slaps his face

CLARA
I’ve heard some whoppers in my day but the fact that you
would expect me to entertain a notion like that for even an
instant is so degrading and insulting All you had to say was
“ don’tlove you and don’t want to see you any more” That
at least would have been respectful

DOC
But it wouldn’t have been the truth

CLARA
Goodbye Emmett That’s what you want so goodbye and
good riddance

The train is just ahead
Doc and Marty pull alongside and ride even with the last (passenger) car
Doc grabs for the ladder on the side of the last car and pulls himself aboard
Marty follows suit
EXT ATOP THE MOVING TRAIN 561
Doc and Marty run across the tops of the cars toward the locomotive
As they near the tender they pull their bandanas up over their faces
IN THE LOCOMOTIVE 562
The ENGINEER and FIREMAN are busy running the train
Suddenly a GUN is thrust against the Engineer’s head

DOC
Do what say and you wont get hurt

ENGINEER
Is this a holdup

DOC
Its a science experiment Stop the train just before you hit
that switchtrack up ahead
EXT IN THE WOODS 563
CLARA runs frantically through the woods
EXT THE TRAIN 564
The Train stops just before the switchtrack
DOC
Marty throw the switch

The Fireman goes running back there to do it

AT THE SWITCH TRACK 565

Marty yanks the switching mechanism switching the main track onto Carson spur

IN THE CAB 566
DOC switches hats with the Engineer

DOC
You can get off now

The engineer jumps off

Doc pushes the throttle forward and the locomotive and tender pull away from the rest of the
train

MARTY climbs up onto the slowly moving train
CUT TO
EXT DELOREAN ON THE TRACKS 567

The DeLorean sits on the tracks undisturbed The LOCOMOTIVE comes chugging along
behind it The BRAKES squeal as the engine pulls to a stop just behind it

CLARA is still running through the woods comes to a bluff Looking down she can see the 568
ABANDONED TRAIN CARS with people milling around

She keeps running
LOCOMOTIVE AND DELOREAN 569

MARTY hands a LOG SHAPED OBJECT tightly wrapped with cloth up to DOC in the cab
Doc has 2 others already on board

MARTY
What are these things anyway

DOC
My own version of “Presto Logs” Compressed wood with
anthracite dust chemically treated to burn hotter and longer
use ‘em in my forge so don’t have to stoke it 3 of these in
the furnace will make the fire burn hotter kick up the boiler
pressure and make the train go faster

CLARA is still running In the distance she can now make out the back of the tender 570
MARTY climbs into the DELOREAN and gets behind the wheel 571
IN THE LOCOMOTIVE 572

DOC pulls out his walkie-talkie

DOC
Testing Marty Do youread
INTERCUT with MARTY in the DeLorean who has his walkie-talkie at hand 573
MARTY

That’s a big 10-4

DOC
Then let’s go home

Marty shifts into neutral and releases the emergency brake

MARTY
Ready to roll

Doc toots the WHISTLE then releases the brake

Air shoots out of the cylinders

Doc opens the throttle

The pistons push the wheels

The locomotive inches slowly forward

The cowcatcher bumps up to the rear of the DeLorean and pushes it forward

Marty smiles

CLARA comes running up just as the locomotive pulls away She spots Doc on the locomotive 574

CLARA
Emmett

But Doc can’t hear her over the sound of the train and his tooting of the whistle

Clara chases after the slowly accelerating train and GRABS the ladder behind the tender
SHE’S ABOARD She sighs and catches her breath

MOVING LOCOMOTIVE (INTERCUT WITH DELOREAN) 575
Doc calls into the walkie-talkie
DOC
Marty are the time circuits on

Marty tums the lever The displays come on

MARTY
Check Doc

DOC
Input the destination time October 27 1985 11am

Marty punches it up on the keypad

MARTY

CLARA climbs up onto the top of the tender which is loaded with timber

CLARA
EMMETT

But Doc can’t hear her over the chugging of the locomotive

Clara walks across the wood toward the locomotive but loses her balance She falls into the
woodpile

The DELOREAN speedometer gauge is at 25
MARTY
(into walkie-talkie)
Were running steady at 25 miles per hour
DOC
All right Im throwing in the Presto logs Once they get going
well really get going

Doc throws the wrapped logs into the furnace

DOC
I’m coming aboard

IN THE DELOREAN Marty reaches over and opens the passenger side gullwing door

Doc climbs out of the cab and along the side of the engine Clara has regained her balance
and is again climbing across the wood in the tender toward the locomotive

In the furnace the cloth around the Presto Logs burns away and the logs themselves begin to
burn with a GREENISH FLAME

Green smoke comes out of the smoke stack

Doc sees it and smiles

The locomotive PRESSURE GAUGE suddenly increases
The locomotive accelerates

The DeLorean digital speedometer shows 363738 Doc is about halfway to the front of the
engine The WALKWAY creaks and gives — the metal is brittle

Clara makes it across the wood and climbs down into the locomotive cab

CLARA
EMMETT

Doc can’t hear her

She sticks her head out of the cab and waves at Doc

But Doc is looking toward the front of the train

Clara screams and waves wildly but can’t get his attention

Doc is just about to the cowcatcher

The speedometer passes 45

Clara blows the whistle

Doc hears the whistle and suddenly realizes someone must be blowing it
Doc looks back and sees Clara He’s totally astonished

DOC
Claral
CLARA
Emmett love you

Marty looks back and sees Doc looking back He calls into the walkie-talkie

MARTY
Yo Doc what’s happening

The speedometer approaches 55

DOC
Its Clara She’s on the train

MARTY
That’s impossible

DOC
She’s here In the cab I’ve gotta go back for her

Doc starts to move back

MARTY
What are you gonna do

DOC
Hope that there’s enough time to stop the train and get her off
before we hit the bridge

But Marty sees the WINDMILL up ahead — the failsafe point

MARTY
Doc see the windmill And were going 60 Youllnever
make it

Doc looks and sees the windmill ahead and watches as they speed past it

DOC
Then well have to take her with us Keep calling out the
speed
(pockets walkie-talkie yells)
Clara Climb out here to me

CLARA

Clara gulps and climbs out
MARTY
65 miles an hour
DOC
Good Youre doing fine Nice and steady

Clara scoots along

DOC
Keep coming
The ground is racing underneath A fall means certain death

MARTY
70

Clara’s foot reaches the brittle section The platform cracks and breaks
She loses her balance and SCREAMS

She falls — but her leg gets caught in a metal brace leaving her HANGING UPSIDE DOWN
WITH HER HEAD INCHES AWAY FROM THE HUGE POUNDING PISTON WHEELS

Doc is horrified

CLARA
HELP

MARTY
75

She struggles to pulls herself back up but she can’t

CLARA
Emmett Help

Ahead the ravine can be seen

Doc looks back and forth trying to decide what to do

MARTY

Marty opens his gullwing door and throws Doc the PINK HOVERBOARD
Doc catches it
The speedometer reads 84 85
Through the windshield the unfinished BRID GE can be seen

576 CLOSE ON CLARA 576
hanging off the locomotive terrified as she slips closer to the pounding pistons

Suddenly DOC appears and pulls her off of there
577 WIDER 577

Doc is on THE HOVERBOARO with an amazed Clara in his arms He hovers clear of the
train

The speedometer hits 88

MUCH WIDER

Doc on the hoverboard with Clara in his arms watches as

The speeding locomotive pushes the DeLorean toward edge of the ravine and
Fire appears around the DeLorean wheels and

The coils glow blue and

The flux capacitor discharges and

The DeLorean is blasted back to future

And then the LOCOMOTIVE GOES OVER THE EDGE OF THE UNFINISHED BRIDGE INTO
THE RAVINE

It is a spectacular train wreck capped with a temendous BOILER EXPLOSION
Doc holds Clara tightly
They kiss
And then they hoverboard off into the western sky

EXT 1985 — CARSON RAVINE BRIDGE — DAY
The BRIDGE as it is in 1985 — completed spanning the ravine

3 SONIC BOOMS and WHITE FLASHES and the DELOREAN reappears on the bridge
speeding along

The DeLorean coasts safely across the bridge to the other side of the ravine decelerating
EXT RAILROAD TRACKS AT AIRPORT

The slowing DeLorean coasts along the tracks near the smalllocal AIRPORT toward a
HIGHWAY INTERSECTION

The CROSSING GATES CLANG they’re almost down
TRACKING WITH THE DELOREAN

MARTY coasts across the highway intersection smiling thinking the crossing gates are down
for him

Then we hear the sound of a DIESEL HORN Marty looks ahead in horror
HIS POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF

A DIESEL ENGINE bearing down on him

EXT TRAIN TRACKS

The head-on collision is unavoidable

The DeLorean slows the gullwing door is thrown open and MARTY rolls out of the DeLorean

just as the Diesel engine SMASHES into the DeLorean TOTALLY DESTROYING IT sending
wreckage everywhere

The Diesel keeps on going

MARTY catches his breath and looks around 706
Twisted metal debris and pieces of the DeLorean are strewn all over

There are small piles of burning heaps

MARTY
Oh God no No

Marty drops to his knees weeping

MARTY
Well Doc its destroyed Just like you wanted

EXT LYON GATES — DAY 707

A very depressed Marty McFly walks through the familiar Lyon Gates and down the street
toward his house

Up ahead BIFF’S AUTO DETAILING TRUCK can be seen parked BIFF is waxing
somebody’s car

Hi Marty How’s everything

MARTY
(without any enthusiasm)

Fine

BIFF

MARTY

EXT McFLY HOME 1985 — DAY 708
Marty walks up his driveway The garage is open and his black Toyota truck is in there
But even the sight of his truck does nothing to buoy his spirits

As Marty approaches the front door GEORGE and LORRAINE pull into the driveway in their
BMW They get out of the car

GEORGE
Marty — what on earth are you wearing

MARTY
Oh that’s along story
LORRAINE

Well everything’s fine now Sort of

Marty stops at a traffic light
Now a hot RED CAMARO pulls up alongside
DRIVER
Hey the Big M How’s it hangin’ McFly Nice truck Lets see
what she can do

The driver is NEEDLES 17 Marty’s future co-worker He races his engine

MARTY
No thanks Needles
Marty pulls forward a few feet

NEEDLES

Marty tenses then backs up even with Needles Marty glares at him
Jennifer reacts with concern
Needles makes “clucking” noises

MARTY
Nobody calls me chicken Needles

Marty races his engine
Needles races his engine

JENNIFER
Marty don’t

Marty puts his hand on his stick shift
Marty looks at the stoplight Red The intersecting light goes from Green to Yellow
Needles is ready
Marty has his clutch down ready to pop it
The two vehicles are like animals ready to charge
The light turns GREEN
The Camaro roars off like a bat out of hell
Marty’s truck just stays there
MARTY
(shakes his head)
But I’m not stupid either
We hear a HORN HONK and a SCREECH OF BRAKES

711 MARTY’S POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD 711

The Camaro narrowly avoids hitting a Rolls Royce that has pulled out of an intersecting
drive way

712 MARTY is astonished He sighs a “that was a close one” sigh 712

MARTY
Jeez woulda hit that Roll Royce

JENNIFER
Rolls Royce

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the crumbled “Youre fired” fax

Jennifer looks at the fax page the words “You’re fired” vanish from it in fact all of the printing
disappears Jennifer examines it amazed It’s simply a blank piece of paper

She shakes her head not sure if she imagined it or what

JENNIFER
It erased

MARTY
(a beat)
Maybe our future hasn’t been written yet
She smiles

EXT TRAIN TRACKS NEAR AIRPORT (WRECKAGE SITE) — DAY
The DeLorean wreckage is still strewn along the tracks
Marty’s truck pulls up and Marty gets out

Jennifer doesnt understand

JENNIFER
What are we doing here

MARTY
Ill just be a minute

Marty pokes through the pieces a fender a train wheel part of a seat a twisted piece of
metal that says “Mr Fusion” a section of the time displays “Last time departed”

Finally he finds what he’s looking for the square case containing the FLUX CAPACITOR

Marty picks it up and examines it The glass cover is shattered and inside the flux capacitor is
broken

Marty sighs
Suddenly there’s a TREMENDOUS SONIC BOOM
Marty and Jennifer react with total incredulity at what they see

A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE is there on the tracks and DOC BROWN is in the cab wearing an
Engineer’s hat

Of course its been modified with big Tesla coils condensers and equipment that looks right
out of Jules Verne including a Victorian style flux capacitor

DOC
Marty Itruns on steam

With Doc in the cab is CLARA and 2 BOYS aged 4 and 6 And EINSTEIN the dog

DOC
Oh I’m married now Meet the family Clara you know and
these are my boys Jules and Verne Boys this is Marty And
Jennifer

Marty is dumbstruck

Marty walks over to the locomotive and stares in awe and joyin seeing the Doc

Doc winks

MARTY
Hi

MARTY
Doc it’s unbelievable This is wonderful And here thought
Id never see you again

DOC
You can’t keep a good scientist down After all had to come
back for Einstein And didn’t want you to be worried about

Marty and me in the future

DOC
That’s up to you Your future hasn’t been written — no one’s

(a beat)
So make it a good one Both of you

Marty puts his arm around Jennifer and smiles

MARTY
We will Doc And what about you Are you going back to
the future

DOC
Nope already been there

Doc pushes a lever the locomotive wheels fold down and the ENTIRE LOCOMOTIVE LIFTS
UP OFF THE TRACK

MARTY and JENNIFER both watch in open mouthed disbelief

DOC and his family wave to Marty as the locomotive ascends higher and FLIES OFF INTO

THE SKY
