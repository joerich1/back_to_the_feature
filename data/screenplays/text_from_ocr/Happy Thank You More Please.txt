In the darkness a ringing phone

INT SAM’S APARTMENT - DAY

The camera slowly pans around a one-bedroom apartment
By the size of itwe can only assume we’re in New York
We see bowls of halfeaten cereal empty beer bottles
clothes on the floor finished-in-pen crossword puzzles
a laptop a typed manuscript on a table etc

The camera then lands on two shirts lying on the sofa
one striped the other solid A hand reaches in and
picks up the solid shirt

The phone finally stops ringing as the answering machine
picks up and we hear

ANNIE (V0)
Sammy boy big day It’s gonna be great

A full-length mirror is propped against a wall In it
we see SAM WEXLER 29 stuffing his arms into the shirt

ANNIE (V0) (CONTD)
Will you call me after your meeting I
need you to talk me down Hey youre
gonna wear the striped shirt right

Sam quickly rips off the solid shirt and grabs the
striped one begins putting it on

ANNIE (V0) (CONTD)
Uch this happens every time I host a
party There’s always this moment
beforehand when I prepare myself to Learn
I’m not nearly as well-liked as I thought
I was

Sam has finished buttoning his shirt and leaves frame
We stay on the mirror

ANNIE (V0) (CONT’D)
And you’ve gotta admit this is weird
Sam I’m having a weird party Tuck
a tuck Don’t forget to tuck

Sam pops back into frame and tucks in his shirt

ANNIE (CONT‘D)
These people can’t know you normally
dress like a fourteen year-old Okay
youre probably gone by now
Sam looks down at his watch He’s late We see him dash
into the bathroom hear him gargling some mouthwash

ANNIE (V0) (CONTD)
Speaking of fourteen year-olds Spencer
Gibson’s gonna be there Mr Hot Floppy-
Hair East Coast Boarding School Man - and
he makes me go weak in the knees Whos
never left Junior High Show of hands

Sam races out of the bathroom dialing his cell phone
He grabs his keys and throws his bag over his shoulder

ANNIE (V0) (CONTD)
Wow huge day for you making it all
about me I’m so good at that-- Ooh
look you’re calling me

She hangs up We can faintly hear Annie on the other
line as Sam walks out the door

SAM
Hey

ANNIE (V0)
How do you look
National Book Award-Winning

Door slams

INT SAMS APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Sam stops cold right at the front door Silence

SAM

ANNIE (V0)
Sorry

SAM
Okay See you tonight

He hangs up and bursts out the front door The sunlight
is blinding and beautiful Sam Wexler’s day has begun

MAIN TITLES
GREAT SONG
Throughout we see various images of our characters

--Sam winding his way through the city streets a spring
in his step He’s feeling good

MARY CATHERINE stacking brushes in an art store lost
in a pleasant memory She and CHARLIE making love in the
morning light

--A young beautiful hairless woman ANNIE putting a
turbanwrap on her head in the mirror It’s clear from
her proficiency she’s done this hundreds of times

EXT STREET - DAY - LATER

Sam has picked up the pace a bit Suddenly he notices a
STRIKING GIRL emerge from the subway carrying a ton of
bags She walks towards him Time stops a bit in the
way it does when beautiful women are drawing near She
smiles at Sam as she approaches

When they are face to face they play a tiny game of
“whos-Gonna-Go-Which-Way” Finally they navigate
things and Sam turns to watch her go She takes a left
into a bar Sam jogs a few steps back to catch the name
of the bar He then heads down into the subway
INT SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Sam looks down at his watch taps his foot He glances
around and notices an OVERWEIGHT BLACK WOMAN She is
surrounded by a gaggle of children to whom she pays
little attention One of the boys is trying to take a
piece of candy from one of the girls

GIRL
(pushing him off)
Stop

He doesn’t He grabs for the candy and she yanks it
away Little pieces spill out all over the train and she
knocks into her mother’s leg

MOTHER
Sitcho ass down

She grabs the girl hard by the arm and pulls her down to
a seat The girl rubs her arm The boy collects random
pieces of the candy and stealthily tosses them at the
girl The mother does nothing

Sam notices another SMALL BLACK CHILD with them He
has thousand year-old eyes and is calmly staring out the
window He and Sam notice each other The boy subtly
tips his chin up at him (What’s up”) Sam tips his chin
back The boy then resumes staring out the window

INT SUBWAY TRAIN —- DAY - LATER

A voice announces the next stop The mother gathers her
things separates the still warring boy and girl and
waits for the train to pull into the station

Sam notices the other boy still seated and staring out
the window The train stops and the mother gets off

The kids file out behind her The boy does not Sam

starts to grow a little concerned

We hear the voice announce the next stop People file
into the train Still the boy does not move We see the
mother and the kids get swallowed by the sea of commuters
on the train platform

Suddenly the boy races toward the exit A erush of
people entering the train block his way He can’t get
through but it doesn’t looks he’s trying that hard The
doors close Sam pops out of his seat and runs toward
the boy as the train begins to move
SAM
Hey What are you doing They’1ll help
you in there

The boy shakes his head “no”

SAM (CONTD)
What are you wanted for something

Nothing Sam has no idea what to do

SAM (CONT’D)
Well someone has to I can’t-- I gotta
leave you here dude I don’t know what
else to do with you

The boy looks devastated Sam gets nearer to him

SAM (CONTD)

holds up seven fingers Whoa

SAM (CONTD)

Rasheen puts down one of his fingers Sam takes this in
He turns back to the phone book but then abruptly shuts
it and tosses it aside

Sam finishes his ice cream sandwich

She kisses him

CHARLIE
You think it’s wimpy to want to leave New

CHARLIE

said the whole town is a blank canvas and
whatever you bring to it that’s what it
is Its just this random collection of
neighborhoods where it’s always sunny
and it basically reflects wherever you
are back at you You’re happy LA’s
great You’re not LA sucks But it
has nothing to do with Los Angeles cause
get this

(greatest thing ever)
Theres no such thing

MARY CATHERINE
And

CHARLIE
And that’s it

MARY CATHERINE

That’s like marrying someone who has no
personality and holding that up as their
chief virtue

(then)
Look this person has nothing going on
and nothing to offer but they really let
me be me

CHARLIE
Not really

MARY CATHERINE
If you don’t feed me soon I’m going to

Well if you think it’s best I mean I
can paint anywhere right

MARY CATHERINE
And we could have a much bigger apartment
and take walks on the beach and it would
force me to get my driver’s license

and ooh we could both stop reading
books and start writing screenplays How
soon can we book our flight

Charlie deflates Mary Catherine grabs his face and
squeezes it tightly making him look ridiculous

totally in love It was just so awful
He said if we had kids and they turned

SAM
Whoa
ANNIE
I know And I just burst into tears I
was like “No you can’t say that don’t
say that You have to love your bald
wife and your little bald kids” But it
made me think about something my mom said
when I was little She literally sat me
down I was like ten or eleven and she
said- to her daughter “Its going to
take a very special man to love you”

SAM
Oh my God
ANNIE
Yeah Thanks mom Helpful

shame as a writer is that I’m just a
suburban kid with good parents I was
fed clothed carpooled Very little in
the way of Hemingwayesque adventure
You know what I’m saying

Rasheen nods

SAM (CONT’D)

I suppose I could demonize the whole
experience which always seems to be in
vogue but honestly I don’t hate my
parents I don’t hate the suburbs - I
don’t want to live there but I don’t
begrudge people the desire to find good
school districts You good on milk

RASHEEN

SAM
Beyond So unburdened with talent it was
amazing I mean what do you say TI had
to break up with her

MISSISSIPPI
Cause she was a bad actress

SAM

No I didn’t care if she was good or not

doesn’t know herself at all” And I
think youre terrific Therefore I can
never come hear you sing Cause it’ll
change everything if I learn you can’t

brings it back to the bed and begins to write

nights You live your life normally but

obligated to lay your weary head

looks down at it He has scribbled a kind of vague
contract outlining the plan There are underlined spaces
for each to sign their names He‘s already signed his

Sign it

Mississippi stares at him still unsure They connect
Something in her shifts He hands her the pen

SAM (CONT’D)

gonna win out over me

CHARLIE
What does Dave have to do with--

MARY CATHERINE
Not the best gamble I might add to
stake your future on a guy who once put
hydrochloric acid on his tongue

On a dare when we were The guy can’t even taste
fourteen and the fact that anything unless it’s
you would even bring that jalepenos he’s like a

I’m being punched in the face for being
human for weighing options-- You know

Mary Catherine and Charlie startled immediately cease
arguing They’ve both suddenly seen a QUADRIPLEGIC MAN

flexible purple straw The image is both tragic and
somehow ridiculous They slowly pass the man and find
their way into the coffee shop

that matters

As Sam 2 continues to speak we move in close on Annie
A GREAT SONG will probably obscure his words as he goes
on but all the information well need will be on Annies

Yeah I know I’m totally gonna get
nominated for a Sincerity Award Fuck
it I dont care I want to win it
You’re a good man Sam Wexler Go get
yourself loved Thats all I got

She hangs up Beat Beat Beat Sam’s eyes blink back
to life Something has been awakened He suddenly runs
out of the apartment

INT SAM‘S APARTMENT STAIRWELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

We see Sam tearing down the stairs fast just like at
the start of the movie

EXT SAMS APARTMENT — NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Sam bursts out the front door and immediately begins
trying to hail a cab Nothing He starts running

We cut to Sam wide-eyed astonished As the song
gathers momentum Mississippi sings with greater and
greater depth and urgency It’s like she’s singing to
save her life

MISSISSIPPI (CONTD)
Play me a madrigal about trips to the

moon

Or some old ballad all about two eyes
shining

It cant be loud enough or a moment too
soon

Sing happy

We see some quick cuts of the others alternating with
shots of Mississippi singing

--Charlie and Mary Catherine like goofy tourists are on
a whirlwind tour of famous New York sights culminating
in the splitting of an enormous pastrami sandwich at the
Carnegie Deli

-We see Annie posing for Sam 2 as he takes pictures of
her Her head is completely uncovered Her poses are
joyful sexy and unself-conscious She’s found herself
in his gaze

--And then A childs small black hand painting something
spectacular

MISSISSIPPI (CONTD)
No need reminding me how it all fell
apart
I need no lyrics singing of stormy
weather
Theres quite enough around me thats
breaking my heart
Sing happy

And were back on Mississippi as she brings the song and
our film to it’s rousing conclusion

MISSISSIPPI (CONTD)
Give me a hallelujah and get up and shout
Tell me the sun is shining around the
corner
Whoevers interested in helping me out
Please keep it happy

We see some rapid-fire shots of Charlie Mary Catherine
Annie and Sam 2 kissing in love all smiles

MISSISSIPPI (CONT’D)
Im only in the market for long loud
laughter
Ill let you serenade me ‘til dawn comes
along
Just make it a happy
Keep it a happy
Song

And back on Mississippi as she absolutely nails the last
note She finishes - drained exhilarated defiant - and
soaks in the thunderous applause We end on Sam his
face sliding up into a wide and grateful smile

THE END
