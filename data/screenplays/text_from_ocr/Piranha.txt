EXT DESERT - DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS

VOLCANIC ROCK outcrop black and jagged WIND whispers A HAWK
cries A GILA MONSTER crawls up and over right past FRAME

Another SAND-DUSTED ROCK OUTCROP where two small SCORPIONS
fight over rodent bones Prominent beside them the FOSSILIZED
IMPRINT of a large SPIRAL SEASHELL

A weather-beaten ROADSIGN rests knocked down half-destroyed
Mesolithic Era Dig Site -- No 2357 Register of National
Historic Places Ahead Next Left Another hawk CRY echoes

STRIATIONS in rock remnants of geologic RIFTS As a TUMBLEWEED
blows past And from such serene detail we now CUT WIDE

EXT LAKE VICTORIA - DAY

Breathtaking in its glimmering grandeur Placid and endless
surrounded by jagged mountain peaks with a PREHISTORIC quality

Tiny and distant amidst the lake - A SMALL FISHING BOAT With
the tinny echo of some HONKY-TONK from a transistor radio

Ahand reaches into the water grabbing a small rope connected to

asix-pack of bottles of beer

ED a blue-collar local cracks open his Bud and watches a

flock of birds flying in formation across the sky His attention
returns to his fishing pole and the nylon line connecting it to

a cork floating peacefully in the water

Ed hums along with the honky-tonkas suddenly the cork
disappears the line tightens and the pole BENDS VIOLENTLY Ed

abandons his beer -- grabs the pole -- hes got a big one
ED
Oh yeah -- you come to papa now

A seasoned sportsman Ed fights with the fish until he finally
lifts abeautiful eight pound bass into the air

ED (contd)
Damn aint you a beautiful thing

The bass frantically resists and in his struggle Ed rocks the
boat knocking his beer overboard--

UNDER THE SURFACE The bottle SPLASHES and SINKS descending 90
feet to the bottomrevealing what no one ever sees--

A SANDY FLOOR LITTERED WITH MORE BOTTLES CANS RUSTY METAL AND
OTHER TRASH THE LEGACY OF DECADES OF TOURIST POLLUTION

As the beer bottle touches the lake bed - A STRANGE TREMOR
CAUSES VIBRATIONS IN THE WATER The ground begins to move with
increasing intensity until a deafening sound erupts-

KRAAAACK A geographic fault splits open
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WATER RUSH VIOLENTLY DOWN INTO THE

BEDROCK FISSURE An ENORMOUS BOULDER is sucked into it
followed by all the trash And the beer bottle

CUT TO
THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE -- The fissure below has created a
SMALL BUT ANGRY CIRCULAR WHIRLPOOL just a few feet from the
boat Ed grips the rocking boat his fish now caught

ED (cont’d)
What in the hell

The circular whirlpool gets bigger and bigger on the surface of
the lake and THE WATER SPINS FASTER AND FASTER--

And before Eds fully aware of the danger--

HIS LITTLE BOAT IS CAUGHT IN THE SPINNING CURRENT INEVITABLY
BRINGING HIM CLOSER TO THE DARK POWERFUL VORTEX

NOTHING CAN STOP THE FRAGILE VESSEL FROM ACCELERATING AS Ed
scrambles to start up the motor He tries desperately to keep
his balance -- but falls overboard

He struggles fighting the riptide clawing the boats hull ina
panic But ultimately disappears into the whirlpool

-and just as suddenly as it began the energy stops The
water flattens Only pleasant HONKY-TONK still plays

-AS A CLOUD OF BLOOD FLOATS UP surrounding the lonesome boat
where the hooked bass still flaps around at lines end--

JUST AS A SHREDDED SKELETAL HAND RIPS THROUGH THE SURFACE OF
THE LAKE STRETCHING ITS FINGERS TO THE SKY

Underneath the water -

AN EYEBALL IS FLOATING SLOWLY IN THE DARKNESS DRAGGING ITS
OPTICAL NERVES IT COMES CLOSER AND CLOSER WHEN-

A BLURRY SHAPE BURSTS INTO FRAME TO GRAB IT

The title fills the frame-

PIRANHA
DISSOLVE TO

EXTREME-CLOSE-UP on a GOLD FISH It swims along without a care
in the world until--

CHOMP A small but ghastly PIRANHA eats it down in one bite
The ugly cold-blooded fish swims on in its aquariumwhile the
LIGHT IN THE TANK switches off

INT THE LAKE VICTORIA PET EMPORIUM - CONTINUOUS

-as a Slightly-awkward teenager JAKE walks a row of
aquarium tanks clicking the lights off for each

JAKE
Nighty-night guys

Hes at work pulling shut a large accordion screen separating
the exotic fish section from the stores other aisles

RADIO ANNOUNCER (0S)
-and the good folks down at the USGS
are now calling it a 57 epicentered smack
dab at the west end of the lake So heres
hoping that fine little afternoon shake-me-
up helps get your beautiful weekend off to
a rockin start--

Behind a counter grandfatherly MR GOODMAN (70s) is up on a
stepladder taking orders from a portly lady customer (50s)
Shes got three FERRETS poking out of her purse

FERRET LADY
No Ive changed my mind not the Deluxe
Ill take the Chateau -- my babies just
deserve the best--

Goodman struggles to put a GIANT PLAY-TOWER FOR CATS back up on
a high shelf to trade with an even larger one Jake sees the

old man start to lose his balance -- he instantly races over--
JAKE
Mr Goodman -- be careful Let me

--and catches the old man before he falls helping him down with
the carpeted cat tower

MR GOODMAN
Whoa now close call Thats my Jake --
always there to count on

FERRET LADY

(ignores takes Chateau )
Oh wook at this my wittle babies wont
this make you a nice wittle home Well
make smores and watch TV and stay snuggly
and safe inside Just till this awful week
is over

(to Jake)
I hope you will do the same young man

She leaves a 20 smooches her ferrets and heads out the door
Goodman follows turns the door sign to Closed Elsewhere in

the store

MRS GOODMAN (70s) is drawing the shades

JAKE
Tanks are clean everybodys fed lights
are out in saltwater and fresh

MR GOODMAN
Thank you Jake I hope you understand
about next week -- it just doesnt make
sense to keep the store open With the
town working ‘round the clock--

JAKE
No I know -- I know how it is -- Moms
made plans for me anyway--

MR GOODMAN
Well I hope they allow for some fun I
mean Spring Break A boy your age

MRS GOODMAN
Oh Carl Now dont cause trouble--

JAKE

MR GOODMAN
When I was sixteen yknow I trekked clear
across Baja At seventeen I was first
mate on a deep-sea marlin boat--

MRS GOODMAN
Good God Carl you sell goldfish and
hamsters Hes always living in the past--

MR GOODMAN

MRS GOODMAN

The night-crawlers For Zane
3 Goodman remembers grabs a plastic bag of BAIT WORMS
MR GOODMAN
Give our best to your brother and sister
Tell ‘em to come on by and say hi And you
go and have a great Spring Break now

MRS GOODMAN
Have a great Spring Break Jake

JAKE
Yeah right thanks

The Goodmans keep closing up Jake sighs to the worms
JAKE (contd)

Like I ever do

4 EXT LAKE VICTORIA COMMUNITY - DAY

The BAG OF WORMS gets dropped on the back of a Vespa scooter
With his Pixies concert T-shirt and his orange vintage helmet
its very hard to tell if Jake is super cool or a complete
nerd but as he ZIPS his ride away from the pet store a CAR
FULL OF PARTYING TEENS blasts on by

PARTYING TEENS
Watch out Sand Rat Where ya goin Sand
Rat Whooo-hoooo

JAKE
Make yourself at home

He rides toward a banner hanging over Main Street WELCOME TO
SPRING BREAK LAKE VICTORIAAS ANGLE CRANES UP AND OVER the
unassuming small-town buildings--

--TO REVEAL THE MASSIVE EXPANSE OF THE LAKE BEYOND filled with
HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF BOATS and partying COLLEGE KIDS

BEGIN OPENING CREDITS ON-

SHOTS of the town completely overrun A tiny fishing community
by winter a wild college party come spring Every motel sign
reads No Vacancy Toothless OLD-TIMERS sit on their porches
in lawnchairs watching CO-EDS in bikinis rollerblade by Local
YOUNG KIDS sit sentry at lemonade stands except their signs say
Cold Beer -- 1 A HIGH SCHOOLs logo reads Lake Victoria
High -- Home of the Sand Rats

Meanwhile Jake zigzags with his scooter down the main street in
between long lines of cars with jet skis and speedboats in tow

He stops at a traffic light and notes a COMMOTION nearby--

A car is halfway on the curb having knocked over a parking
meter A trio of unruly FRATBOYS are to blame

FRATBOY DRIVER
Officer it was a mistake Cant we work
something out here

A pretty female sheriff JULIE FORESTER (mid 30s) listens with
zero sympathy Shes seen his kind too many times before

JULIE
Mistake or no mistake you destroyed public
property And from the smell of your
breath I suggest you take this ticket and
get one of your friends to drive you home

The Fratboy scoffs showing off for his pals
FRATBOY DRIVER
I dunno Sheriff I was kinda hoping you
might drive me home
He flicks Julies shirt Her eyes instantly shoot up
ON JAKE shakes his head smiles Dont mess with the sheriff
JULIE
Touching an officers uniform is considered

assault Were you aware of that

FRATBOY DRIVER
Hey cmon -- you look pretty hot in tan--

And as he reaches a too-friendly hand out again--

BAM An elbow to the stomach WWWWRENCH An arm-socket twist
and over-shoulder-flip SLAM Fratboy hits the ground face-
first HAND-CUFFED before he has a clue what hit him

JULIE
Its not tan Its beige

His buddies edge closer but Julies TASER GUN is up and ready
JULIE (contd)
You boys take another step youll be

pissing lightning bolts into next week

Jake smiles and drives away-
EXT LAKE VICTORIA COMMUNITY - DUSK

Metal rock music blares from a pick-up truck Kids cruising
Two hot buxom college coeds strut half naked in front of wide-
eyed TRAILER PARK GRANDMAS who shake their heads in disgust

Other kids are filling rental boats with coolers wake boards
and life vests Jet skies are lowered from their trailers
while college jar-heads high five each other whistle at girls
and chug beer Further away a large floating stage is being set
up to host the daily spring break events

END CREDITS AS Jake pulls into the marinas parking lot As
he stares at the mass of partying young humanity

KELLY (0S)

college

He turns to see KELLY a cute local standing nearby

JAKE

average day in class

KELLY

JAKE
Oh yeah Cant wait Me too

Then he realizes he still has his helmet on Swiftly takes it
off Kelly smiles Theres a comfortable familiarity

10 EXT LAKE SWAMPLANDS - DEAD OF NIGHT

A remote and marshy part of the lake jet-black and ominous
As a POLICE CARS HEADLIGHTS cut through the reeds

Crunching over overgrown dirt road patchy with weeds Rumbling
and remote

10

The car stops at roads end -- and its Julie who emerges
Bleary-eyed just awakened uniform off-kilter She rendezvous
with reliable DEPUTY FALLON beside his own patrol car

DEPUTY FALLON
Hope I didnt wake the kids Jules--

JULIE
Its OK They sleep through anything
(beat)
So Maggie last heard from him yesterday

DEPUTY FALLON
Yeah Just before noon Says Ed took his
boat out to bring back some bass So she
drove ‘round the lake all night looking--

JULIE
Wheres the boat

At waters edge stands DEPUTY GREEN with Eds wife MAGGIE
Beyond them is a 50-foot-long ROTTED PIER Falling apart amidst
the sinister swamp Tall weeds protrude everywhere

---and tangled twenty feet off piers end is EDS FISHING BOAT
No sign of any life inside The duo keep their voices low

FALLON
Feelin like a skinny dip Jules

JULIE
You figure we can make it to the end of
that pier

FALLON
Meaning what Im too old or Im too
heavy

JULIE

Too chickenshit whaddya think

(calls to Maggie)
Were gonna go get his boat Maggie Dont
you worry Ed just probably had to ditch
it

MAGGIE
But he hasnt spent a night away from home
in thirty years And he has a bad heart
Doc Endicott told him

Deputy Green keeps the worried woman at bay
As Julie and Fallon warily step onto the piers rotten planks

Their FLASHLIGHT BEAMS dance in the gloom CREEEEEAK the
sodden boards MOAN with rot each step is precarious 10

The light beams illuminately briefly the mucky water beneath the
boards And some mysterious DARTING SHADOWS

FALLON
Jules you hear something down there

JULIE
Just the lake Ray

FROM UNDERWATER beyond a TANGLE OF REEDS in the moonlight
Julie and Fallons DARK SILHOUETTES dance and sway

Near the piers end Fallon reaches it first One last plank to
a busted railing But as he leans weight on it theres a SNAP

FALLON
That didnt sound good

He shifts his weight back as Julie moves closer to him -- and
RRIIIPPP The boards mid-pier GIVE WAY and Julie PLUMMETS IN

She fully submerges vanishing into the murk

FALLON (cont’d)
Julie JULIE

A moments tense silence

--and then an ERUPTION OF WATER as Julie SPRINGS UP just behind
him in the fg at piers end Wet surly spitting mud

JULIE
Okay THAT was disgusting

Waist deep in muck Julie edges forward spreading the high
weeds with her arms Its still tense Shes easy prey

--but she wades and reaches the empty boat Inside the dead
bass is still hooked on Eds fishing line Julie finds a coil
of rope TOSSES it to Fallon on piers end

JULIE (contd)
Take the line and pull it to shore How
long you think the thing was drifting

Fallon starts reeling in the fishing boat leaving Julie now
alone in the middle of the swamp

She looks around searching for a clue anything that could help
to find Ed Her eyes finally stop on something A few feet away-

Three GNARLED DISCOLORED TWIGS stick out of the water- one of
them with a GLINT OF METAL reflecting the moonlight 10

Julie edges closer getting a sinking feelingas she wipes the
mud from the metalto reveal its a WEDDING RING Those
things arent twigs at all

JULIE (contd)
Ray I need you to have Carter move Maggie
Boyd outta here

FALLON
Whaddya see Jules--

JULIE
Now do it now Ray -- shit

She jumps a little swatting the water at her legs On guard

FALLON
What
JULIE
A fish or something -- nicked me--

--as KRAAAAK The end of the PIER gives way Fallon SLIDES
down the planks SPLASHES into the water--

--as his FLASHLIGHT submerges and lights up some gray striped
FISH just as Julie sees a BASS poke its head from the water
nibbling a bit of flesh from the white bones

FALLON
Ah shit -- just a bunch of bass--
But Julies still startled and she takes a step back -- atop

the bodys foot like a lever--

--causing EDS HALF-FLESH-STRIPPED SKELETON to POP UPWARD
straight out of the swamp its momentum carrying it forward--

--to COLLIDE with Julie as it falls atop her bits of flesh and
viscera hanging off bone LIKE ITS BEEN DIPPED IN ACID Tiny
crabs and insects crawling out of mouth and eye sockets

Julie YELLS in fright Fallon CRIES OUT too And poor Maggie
the widow now sees -- and SCREAMS And SCREAMS

Julie FLAILS to get out from under the corpse splashing and
scrambling to escape the muck and get back to shore joining
Fallon mid-swamp as they scramble back onto land--

--where Julie and Fallon stare back at the horrid floating body
amidst the detritus of the boat and destroyed pier

FALLON (cont’d)
You all right

They catch their breath to the din of Maggies screams
JULIE

Ive been better

EXTINT POLICE STATION - NEXT MORNING

Julies patrol car parks behind the police station which has
been built on the waterfront Shes on the phone as she exits
all cleaned up from the night before

JULIE
-look his boat was fine and those were
not propeller wounds Theres no way it
was a boating accident Tell him I want
toxicity tests like for acid or something
some flesh-eating thing Yeah well tough
shit if youre having breakfast my day
started with a biohazard bath--

The tiny station is PACKED WITH PEOPLE as Julie makes her way
inside Among them is the town neurotic

TOWN NEUROTIC
Sheriff Forester Those b-b-boys came by
last night and do you know what they d-d-
did They exposed their g-g-genitals

JULIE
Did you get a look at their faces

TOWN NEUROTIC
No But I can ID the rest

Others in the office cant help themselves from laughing

JULIE
Look people if any of you are here to
report public drunkenness or nudity were
not taking those complaints today

Half the room groans and turns to leave

JULIE (contd)
- And that includes anybody peeing on
your house or property

Most of the other half groans and follows Her secretary AMY
hands Julie some phone messages

AMY
Youve got twenty calls already and Mr
Gordons waiting in your office

(MORE )

AMY (contd)
(scrunches up nose)
Whats that smell

JULIE
Chemical scrub you should try it

12 INT JULIES WORK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MR GORDON the dams annoyingly humorless chief engineer
regards the lake as Julie enters leaving Amy behind--

JULIE
What can I do you for Mr Gordon

MR GORDON
Julie I think we may have a situation
Weve detected a water level drop at the
dam 42 inches in the last twelve hours

Julie grabs a radio waterproof jacket and sheriffs hat--

JULIE
Cant you just slow your output flow and
let the lake fill up again

MR GORDON
Apparently the anomaly began right after
yesterdays quake

Julie now stops That part is serious

JULIE
Tell me the dams still structurally sound--

MR GORDON
Yes yes theres no breach that was
checked right away The water loss has
apparently been elsewhere--

JULIE
Whats that mean Where does water go

MR GORDON
Simple physics Sheriff Water goes down
USGS recorded heavy seismic shifting
directly beneath the lakes south end--

A YOUNG DEPUTY pokes his head in her office--

DEPUTY GREEN
Rockys Joint is selling liquor already

JULIE
I told him not before noon didnt I

DEPUTY GREEN
You sure did

MR GORDON
We need to have a site survey done Ive
requested a team of seismologist divers--

JULIE
Uh-huh Okay

EXT POLICE DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

With her gear Julie heads out a back exit Gordon follows--

MR GORDON
--and I told ‘em you would escort them out

Almost to her patrol boat Julie stops in her tracks

JULIE
Mr Gordon as you know our quiet little
town of twenty-five hundred has just been
invaded by twenty thousand kids who -- for
the next ten days -- have just one thing in
mind drink themselves into oblivion and
screw anything thats not nailed down
Which makes me kinda sorta busy at the
moment

MR GORDON
Those twenty thousand kids Julie are the
ones who provide jobs for this fine town
They only come here because of the lake
And I am telling you its losing water

JULIE
What time do the divers get here

MR GORDON
Theyll be here by noon

JULIE
I can only spare two hours Theyd better
be on time

She hops onto her boat Fallons on board waiting They
depart the dock as a SECOND BOAT brings back to the station some
drunken kids wearing life-vests and handcuffs

FALLON
Welcome to Spring Break Lake Victoria

Off Julie’

EXT JULIE

JULIE
Thanks for reminding me

FALLON
Of what

JULIE
To call in sick this year
(checks her watch)
Eds body must be just getting to
Huntsville What would you say to the idea
of closing the lake until we get the
autopsy report

FALLON
Id say itll take days to get something
conclusive And thats two-thirds of the
towns annual income youd be putting on
the line Last I checked Julie sheriffs
get elected

s conflicted look

EXT LAKESIDE ROAD - DAY

A retro Welcome to Lake Victoria billboardas a CONVERTIBLE

COLLEGE GIRLS scream as they hang out of the car

The BIKER recklessly lifts the shield of his helmet to wink at
the cheering girls Hes a little too old for spring break but
his spirit is just right This is SAM (early 40s)

A LARGE TRUCK follows the motorcycle and the girls A magnet on
the side reads UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY

INT USGS TRUCK - DAY

Team leader NOVAK (mid 30s) is at the wheel A friendly charmer
of a mans man scruffy facial hair and truckers cap on
backwards Next to him a cowboy-hatted tomboy PAULA NOVAK

fourths

PAULA

EXT LAKE VICTORIA - MAIN PIER - DAY

Seen from above in slow motion a hot big-breasted chick jumps
ona trampoline With every jump she gets closer to camera

Loud music pulsates from dozens of boats anchored in and around
the main pier Party-goers drink dance and scream

The entire marina has been turned into A GIANT OPEN AIR DANCE
FLOOR packed with tanned young flesh The docks are bustling
with activity as people prepare for a day on the lake The
boats range from little dingies to two-engine racing boats

Amidst it all Deputy Fallon works to keep some semblance of
order Accosting a FAT FRAT who tossed trash in the lake

FALLON
Thats the town rules kid You toss a
piece of trash in our lake you gotta jump
in and pick ten pieces up

The fat kid protests but the partiers around him shout Go Go
Go Go until his BUDDIES toss him in The kid surfaces with
HANDFULS of plastic bags and beer cans Everybody CHEERS

FURTHER DOWN THE DOCKS the USGS truck has parked Novak
and Paula unload dive tanks and hardware Sam joins them
carrying RED POM-POMS waving to the convertible girls

SAM
After the dive our presence is requested
at Kokomo by the Arizona State
Cheerleading team

EXT MAIN PIER - ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME 20

Deputy Fallon and Green walk bynot seeing Jake crouched
behind a pick-up truck on his idling SCOOTER Keeps face
shielded until theyre past Then parks and enters the crowd

---walking down the dock looking for the Wild Wild bunch
We hear snippets of the semi-drunk boat captains as he passes

BOAT CAPTAIN 1
---now the same rules apply to the water as
on the road No drinking and driving
And no show-boating

BOAT CAPTAIN 2
Lake Victoria is forty-five miles long and
ranges in width from one mile to three So

JUST THEN he hears HOWLING in the water Jake runs to the edge
of the dock to get a better look--

AS SCENE SHIFTS TO SLO-MO for Jakes POV of Danni on a central

KELLY (0S)

both hands over his shorts

JAKE

four oclock For the Lake Victoria Wet T-
Shirt Wild-strava-ganza

The crowd CHEERS Derrick motions to Andrew He BLASTS some
music as he STARTS the engine And the Water Bug heads out

Derrick pumps his arms to the music then heads after the girls
Jake basks in the energy of the moment seeing Matt and Brett
furious seeing the crowd waving them offbut its a brief
moment of vindication

-because he turns back toward the bow where he sees Derrick
saunter up to Danni Crystal and Kellyand slip an arm around
Kellys waist His dream day is turning into a nightmare

EXT ZANES HOUSE - DAY 21

A JET SKI blasts past -- Whoo-hoo In its wake we reveal Zane
slowly push an aluminum canoe off their dock He carries a
backpack pole and tackle and Mr Goodmans BAG OF WORMS

LAURA
Zane We have to talk about this We told
Jake wed stay at the house

ZANE

Islands really close

21

Laura sighs Finally gets in and grumbles

LAURA
I shouldve brought my trombone
ZANE
No way Be a girl and just sunbathe or

something

As they push off Laura leans back at the bow and trails both
hands in the water wiggling her fingers

FROM UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE Lauras fingers are seen The
small vulnerable boat is the only thing on the vast surface

EXT LAKEINT SHERIFFS PATROL BOAT - DAY 22

Elsewhere A POLICE BOAT ZOOMS across the water at a speedy clip
of 20 knots It carries Julie Novak Sam and Paula

Julies at the helm Sam and Paula PREP GEAR at the stern
while Novak enters intrigued by the Sheriff

NOVAK
You dont see many women working law
enforcement out here in cowboy country

JULIE
We see a lot of cowboys though

Novak grins Watches her steely eyes survey the lake

NOVAK
I heard when they first built the dam this
place was a real pristine paradise
Stocked with fifty different species of

fish Must be hard to watch -- year after
year -- when yahoos take it over this way
JULIE

NOVAK

JULIE

Species of fish
Novak nods Glances to the water with a troubled frown
NOVAK

You know the strange thing about that I
havent seen a fish yet this whole trip

23 EXT THE WATER BUG - LAKE- DAY 23

Upbeat MUSIC is PUMPING as The Wild Wild Girls boat cruises
Jakes with Andrew with a LAKE MAP spread out at the helm

ANDREW
Its our first year shooting Lake Victoria
Usually were at Panama Beach or South
Padre But those girls are so quick to
take it off -- theres no more surprises
you know what I mean Derrick wants to
capture innocence He says its all about
innocence

Jake listens distracted watching Kelly off with Derrick and
Crystal Drinking glasses of CHAMPAGNE Derrick keeps trying
to pull her closer Kelly repeatedly wriggles free She tries
to laugh and smile but shes getting a touch uncomfortable

She turns to see Jake looking at her and both of them pretend to
look somewhere elseas Danni sidles up to the helm area

ANDREW (contd)
So how come everyone calls you local kids
Sand Rats

JAKE
Its what they called the workers who built
Parker Dam -- in the 30s Without them
thered be no lake no town Before the
dam this whole thing was desert

Danni sees Jakes attention is locked on Kelly

DANNI
Yknow I wish guys would stare at me like
youve been staring at her for the last
thirty minutes

JAKE
Who me No way I wasnt staring at her

DANNI
Dont worry Derricks just making his

Derrick turns back to Kelly Says something that makes her
laugh Danni leans into Jake with a whisper

DANNI
So speaking of wildyou havent seen

EXT THE WATER BUG - LAKE - LATER 24

The Wild Wild Girls boat has anchored in a beautiful cove
Suddenly two SPLASHES ERUPT in the fg -- as Danni and Crystal
surface for breaths like glistening sea nymphs--

DERRICK (0S)
OK action action here we go Lets get
you girls into character

They swim to the boat ladder where Jake is standingas they
reach up to hand him their BIKINI TOPS and BOTTOMS The water
refracts their naked figures beneath

DANNI
Here you go Jake Why dont you put it
somewhere

CRYSTAL

Yeah Put it anywhere you want

24

She and Crystal swim off laughing and splashingas we now
reveal Kelly sunbathing on an INNER TUBE nearby She watches
Jake eyes narrowed holding the dripping bikinis

JAKE
Um see its -- part of the job -- I have
to -- get busy with -- be right back--

--as he darts down into the cabin the Wild Girls call to Kelly

CRYSTAL
Hey Kelly cutie Wanna join us
KELLY

CRYSTAL

DANNI

KELLY

Oh OK do your thing Not for me

Seen from the depths of the lake Kellys white skin glows in
the sunlight making her seem vulnerable

INT THE WATER BUGUNDERWATER - DAY 25

The main cabin of the WWG boat is GLASS-BOTTOMED Derrick and
Andrew both aim HD cameras toward the glass--

--as Crystal and Danni cross in the fg like mermaids
underwater tangled and frolickingand fully naked

IN THE CABIN Jake tries to peer over Derrick and Andrews

JAKE
Oh my Godoh my God

Jake scampers up to the deck to get away from Derricks noise--

JAKE
No no that was kids out on the lake

--and on deck he peers over the edge both port and starboard
hoping for another glimpse of Danni and Crystal--

JULIE
I know Jake listen to me I dont want
Zane or Laura near the lake today

26
JAKE
OK Mom Well stay inside well catch
some TV -- whatevers on--

--and as he catches the briefest glimpse of naked Danni and
Crystal swimming back under the boat hand-in-hand--

--he looks to Kellys inner tubeand sees it floating EMPTY
A half-empty champagne glass rests there upon it Jake now
looks troubled where is she

JULIE
OK thanks honey Gotta go I owe you for
this one I1l try to be home early

Seeing the Divers ready she hangs up So does Jake
Hes still staring at the empty inner tube

JAKE
Kelly Hey KELLY WHERE ARE YOU

Silence on the water

JAKE (contd)
KELLY

A shift in the waves causes Kellys champagne glass to tip over
Falls Sinks Worried Jake jumps into action He pulls off
his shirt and DIVES into the water--

--SWIMMING FAST for the inner tube where he searches all
around diving to scan underwater seeing nothing below He
surfaces again gasps for air crying out--

JAKE (contd)
KELLY KELLY YOU GUYS HELP

KELLY (0S)
Help with what

Looking back to the boat he sees Kelly standing at the ladder
where Danni and Crystal are climbing out Kelly hands them
towels as they wrap themselves up

KELLY (cont’d)
Whatcha doing all the way out there Jake
You just missed the rest of the show

Kelly gives him a smirk and walks away Jake just floats at
the inner tube Outsmarted again

EXT WATER BUG - MOMENTS LATER 27

Jake climbs back on board wet and sour as Derrick accosts him

DERRICK
Hey Jake my man Cant thank you enough

INT SAND ISLAND - DAY 28

CAMERA PANS over the beautiful but tiny Sand Islandto find
Laura and Zane Zane has his fishing gear but no fish
Theres staring at a docking postwith nothing there

LAURA
Wow Good work Way to tie off the canoe

ZANE
I must have gotten my knots mixed up

LAURA
So you catch zero fish and you lose our
only boat This day is just full of
accomplishments

ZANE
Jake is gonna kill us

LAURA
Moms gonna kill Jake

ZANE
So its a good newsbad news thing

LAURA
Somebody1l see us Somebody will stop

Zane surveys the island while Laura removes her flip-flop and
steps into the water looking over the lake for any boats
Further away unnoticed A HUGE SHADOW moves underneath the
water changing shape rapidly A SCHOOL OF FISH

28

Underwater- we can see Lauras feet walking between the rocks
when- The little girl steps on A BROKEN BEER BOTTLE-

LAURA (cont’d)
Ouch

She sees A TINY PIECE OF GLASS lodged in her foot Painfully
she removes it revealing A SMALL CUT that starts bleeding-

A few drops of blood hit the surface of the lake-

IN THE WATER THE MOVING SHADOW ACCELERATES TOWARDS THE BLOOD
IT IS ALMOST AT THE LITTLE GIRLS FEET WHEN-

ZANE (0S)
LAURA COME CHECK THIS OUT

Laura steps back on shore-

On the other side of the small island Zane has just found
someones camp site a tent and BBQ are unattended

ZANE (contd)
Hello is anyone here

Zane peeks into the tent as Laura joins him

ZANE (contd)
Campers They mustve just left

LAURA
Without their gear They even left their
shoes

ZANE

Maybe they went for a swim

LAURA
But they couldnt have gotten over here
without a boat right

Zane sees nothing but rocks protruding all around the island
Very distant SOMETHING BRIGHT ORANGE shimmers in the water

LAURA (cont’d)
What is it

ZANE
I dunno But its upside-down

Two hundred yards from the island an overturned kayak is
drifting away The camera dives beneath the surface revealing-

DISSOLVE TO

29 INT SHERIFFS PATROL BOAT - DAY 29

A DIGITAL IMAGE of the lake bottom on a radar screen A large
BLACK ANOMALY is right in the middle of it

PAULA
Theres your drop in water level Sheriff
You got yourself a brand-new fissure
cracked open right at the epicenter

The back of the boat now looks more like a NASA command center
than an old police patrol craft

JULIE
Whoa look at the size of that What is
it a cavern system

NOVAK
Looks to me like a subterranean lake
Probably bigger than the one above That
gap there opened up a connecting passage

JULIE
Wait -- a lake under the lake

NOVAK
Sorry Sheriff Still your jurisdiction
Part of an old volcanic ridge -- theyre

all over the area

PAULA
Thats the beauty of it -- were gonna be
the first ones to ever explore it

SAM
I dont get why youre always so excited
All we ever see is rocks and sand

PAULA
Were popping its cherry Sammy

SAM
Oh Shit When you put it like that

30 UNDERWATER - MOMENTS LATER 30

Seen from deep underneath Fallons boat the divers enter the
water simultaneously

EXT PATROL BOAT - SAME TIME 31

Novak remains up top to monitor and guide the operation

JULIE
You should probably warn ‘em its not very
pretty down there Tourists treat this
lake like a garbage can

NOVAK
(on the radio to test)
How you guys doin Sheriff says its a
regular treasure trove down there I got
dibs on fake gold jewelry and any back
issues of Playboy

PAULA (0S)
I got dibs on home appliances

SAM (0S)
I got dibs on missing college girls

NOVAK
Last year we dove the sewers of New
Orleans Trust me Cant be any worse

UNDERWATER 32

With Sam in the lead the two divers descend towards the fault
releasing streams of bubbles back to the surface

PAULA
Were getting closer to the fault Water is
clear Almost full visibility

Within minutes they stop at the edge of the geological tear-
their small human bodies reveal the sheer size of the opening
and the scale of the damage done by the quake-

The fault line extends like an open wound along the surface
PAULA (contd)
Oh my God this is the longest one Ive

ever seen

SAM
Can you keep your mind on the task at hand

PAULA
Wow Sam Arent you deep

32

SAM
There you go again

He picks up from the garbage-strewn ground a Campbells can

SAM (contd)
Hey Chicken soup for the soul

PAULA
Its at least two hundred feet Novak
Were switching on lights and going in

After a last equipment check they slowly enter the dark
crevasse The two divers disappear deep into the lake floor

INSIDE THE CRACK 33

The crevasse seems endless- the walls which extend deeper and
deeper narrow progressively towards the bottom- the divers look
around in amazement

SAM
Descending fissure Novak do you copy

NOVAK (0S)
Yeretty good

PAULA
You should see this Its unbelievable
The sedimentary lines are so clearly
defined

Finally the crack has become too narrow for them to pass but an
opening remains large enough for one diver to go deeper-

SAM
Looks like single file time Ill go first

PAULA
No I should do the prelim scout Your fat
ass will get stuck

SAM
Baby Im like an eel An electric eel I
get into such tight spaces its shocking

PAULA
I cant believe youve ever had a date in
your life

44

SURFACE - SHERIFFS BOAT 34

Novak and Julie follow the divers movements Into radio

JULIE

Looks like theyve reached the bottom
NOVAK

No -- see Thats their depth theyre

still Hmm Theyre splitting up Hey
Im losing you guys Everything OK

But now theres nothing but radio STATIC

INSIDE THE CRACK 35

Attached to a nylon safety reel Sam descends slowly into the
hole barely large enough to hold both him and his equipment

With his tanks sliding and banging against the rocky razor
sharp walls Sam must use his hands to propel himself

SAM

Hey Paula This increase in pressure

reminds medid I ever tell you about my

first blowjob

From the other side Paula watches the thin safety rope unwind

PAULA

Heard the story before And its much too

short

Suddenly the safety line JERKS TO A STOP

PAULA (cont’d)
Sam Sam

Silence

PAULA (cont’d)
Sam

SAM (VO)
(from radio)
Yeeeeees

Relieved Paula curses Over the radio Sam is heard laughing

Back in the hole Sam continues moving Up ahead just a few
feet is an ominous black hole It’s the end of the tunnel

35

SAM (contd)
End of the tunnels right -- Whoa Im
hitting a serious drop in temperature Its
at least thirty degrees colder

PAULA
Youre probably at the mouth of the
underwater lake Do you have any visual

He gets to the edge it’s an amazing sight A cave so big that
even his flashlight is too weak to make out the other end

It’s pitch black on all sides as he swims through the opening

SAM
Jesus This thing seems endless

Some huge stalagmites are coming out of the ground in the dark

Looking closer theres something strange about them like if they
were slowly waving Sam removes a portable sonar He scans
inside the cave and gets a reading of 250 ft

He moves the laser around when-

SOMETHING SWIMS BEHIND HIM

He turns quickly around pointing the flashlight towards the
cave wall- JUST A LONG SEAWEED PASSING WITH THE CURRENT

He looks more closely and recognizes-
THOUSANDS OF FISH EGGS CLINGING TO THE KELP AND THE ROCKS
Sam turns back to the moving stalagmites and realizes-

THEY ARE MADE UP OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FISH EGGS
ATTACHED TO THE LENGTH OF SOME TALL SEAWEED

SAM (contd)
Holy shit Its like fish eggs everywhere

Swimming backwards his fins accidentally nudge the egg
formations SENDING A BUNCH OF THEM FLOATING AWAY IN THE WATER-

ONE OF THE EGGS COMES SO CLOSE TO THE CAMERA THAT WE CAN SEE
INSIDE -

A CREEPY FISH EMBRYO MOVING IN ITS SAC REVEALING PIERCING RED
EYES AND SHARP TEETH

Sam approaches the rocky wall of the cave to touch the eggs when-

A BLURRY SHAPE COMES FROM NOWHERE ATTACKING HIS HAND 35

SAM (contd)
FUCK

Sam pulls back What was that Looking back down he realizes
he’s been severely bitten by whatever it was

PAULA (0S)
Sam what are you seeing down there
Cmon Sam stop messing around

Blood streams from his hand in a steady flow

SAM
Something bit me

PAULA (0S)
Oh yeah I thought you always liked that
kind of stuff
(silence now worries)
Sam You hearing me Sam

Worried Sam looks around in the darkness but his flashlight
simply fades into emptiness Needing a stronger source he
lights an UNDERWATER FLARE whose blue electric light REVEALS--

--ACAVERN WALL of STARING PIRANHAS

WITH BARELY ENOUGH TIME TO SEE THEIR TEETH THEY HAVE ALREADY
ATTACKED SAM SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER

PAULA (0S) (contd)
SAM

At the same moment Paula appears at the end of the tunnel-Her
eyes freeze behind her mask as she watches-

THE WHIRLPOOL OF FISH FORMING AROUND SAM WHOSE BLUE ELECTRIC
AURA TURNS BLOODY RED THE SWARM MOVES AS ONE ENTITY A SINGLE
PREDATOR WITH A THOUSAND PARTS

The flare descends to the bottom landing on thousands of fish
skeletons

WITH NO TIME TO TURN AROUND PAULA DESPERATELY TRIES TO BACK-
TRACK UP THE TUNNEL BACKWARDS

SURFACE - SHERIFFS BOAT 36

On Novaks monitors Sam’s vital signs go haywire FLAT-LINING
while Paula’s vitals ACCELERATE

NOVAK
Jesus Christ somethings happening--

36

JULIE
What an aftershock Novak what

NOVAK
I DONT KNOW I have to get down there

In a flash Novak slips his own scuba tank on

BACK IN THE CRACK 37

Breathing heavily Paula moves backwards through the tight
tunnel as fast as she can

THE PIRANHAS ENTER THE TUNNEL

PAULA
No no Paula swim fucking SWIM

Paula struggles as she fits through the tight hole squeezing
through and accelerating towards the other end

The piranhas approach CLACK CLACK CLACK

PAULAS POV - THE SCHOOL QUICKLY CATCHES UP AND THE LEAD FISH
ARE ALREADY BITING HER HANDS AND FACESHE GURGLINGLY SCREAMS

IN THE CRACK 38

Paula exits the tunnel and swims in the opposite direction ina
total state of hysteria- AROUND HER SCUBA MASK HER FACE IS
COMPLETELY BITTEN TO THE BONE

A giant flurry of carnivorous fish follow Paula out of the
tunnel where they finally have enough room to surround her--

SHAKEN LIKE A RAG DOLL SHE IS RIPPED TO SHREDS IN A ANOTHER
WHIRLPOOL OF BLOOD

Just as the piranhas are about to dig into her liver NOVAK
APPEARS ABOVE THE OPENING EYES WIDE AND INCREDULOUS GRABBING
PAULA’S ARM AND PULLING HER OUT OF THE FAULT

EXT LAKE — DAY 39

Novak surfaces above the water swimming rapidly and dragging
Paulas body through the whirlpool of blood

NOVAK
SHERIFF HELP ME

39

Julie reaches overboard helping Novak back into the boat His
wetsuits legs are SLASHED and bleeding In turn Novak pulls
Paula up and out of the water--

There remains practically nothing of her body It’s as if she
was dipped in sulfuric acid Julie literally RECOILS--

JULIE
Oh my GOD

Novak removes his mask and regains his breath HES IN TOTAL
SHOCK but his wounds are superficial He and Julie stare

---at a lone live PIRANHA as it flops around on the deck

EXT THE WATER BUG - DAY 40

A belly button is filled with tequila -- to the sounds of UPBEAT
PARTY MUSIC As Derricks face leans in

--to suck it out of Crystals belly button His mouth moves up
her body to take a slice of lemon from between her lips

He then turns to his audience Danni Jake Kelly and Andrew

DERRICK
Ladies your body is a temple And its
time to give thanks to the gods Andrew
roll camera Kelly -- youre up

KELLY
Me No thanks no I think Ive had too
much already

DERRICK

altar I know youre partial to champagne
But baby you can trust Crystal--

Jakes had enough and decides to come to her rescue

JAKE

Derrick cmon man She said no
DERRICK

difference She understands gratitude is
the right attitude

(from menace to a smile)
Kelly sugar take it from me Its never

Kelly puts her glass down just a little unsteady

DANNI
Go ahead Kelly Try it Its fun

DERRICK

JAKE

KELLY

Jake blinks surprised Huh Derrick swiftly motions to
Andrew roll camera roll camera She mock-Wild Girl-walks
over to Derrick just trying to make Jake squirm Derrick runs
a trail of salt down from Crystals stomach then fills her
belly button with tequila

DERRICK
First you lick the salt then you suck the
tequila then you get the lemon Body

(hands her a SHOT)
Do this one first For a little courage

Everyones eyes are on Kelly Her eyes are on Jake Like this
challenge is somehow about him She downs the shot

JAKE
Kelly you dont have to do this

KELLY
We dont need your babysitting here

After a deep breath Kelly kneels beside Crystal and leans in
licking the salt trail to her belly button

Jake is mesmerized as Kelly sucks up the liquor then moves up
Crystals body Next is the lemon But when Kelly moves to her
mouth to get it Crystal grabs the back of her head and MAKES
OUT with her Danni WHOOPS playfully Andrew BEAMS--

DERRICK
(a private smile)
Little Kelly America thanks you

Kellys eyes open wide with surprise She tries to pull away
but Crystal holds her tight Till she gives in and kisses back--

40 40

ANDREW
Whoa Jake Check it out We got a Sand Rat
making out with a model You were probably
hoping that was your job

--Kelly finally pulls away now a bit embarrassed glancing to
Jake She realizes the alcohols gotten to her--

DERRICK
OK how bout we trade places now Jake

JAKE
(revenge on Kelly)
Fine wheres the lemon

CRYSTAL

But Dannis aware of the tension here and intervenes--

DANNI

KELLY

DERRICK

More timidly Kelly lies down on her back Danni gives her a
dont worry pat pours the salt and fills up the tequila 40

Jake kneels before her reluctantly She seems so vulnerable
this way so trying to be someone shes not as Derrick and
Andrew both filming start up competitive chants

ANDREW DERRICK
Sand RatsSand Rats JakeJakeJakeJake

Almost apologetic Jake licks the salt drinks the tequila and
approaches Kellys face Their lips are about to touch with
that first dreamed-of hoped-for kisswhen all of a sudden--

Kelly sits up and vomits overboard

DERRICK (cont’d)
Oh my God Shes PUKING

ANDREW

INT WATER BUG - HEAD - MOMENTS LATER 41

Kelly finishes vomiting in the head as Jake stands behind her
awkwardly holding her hair Then she waves him away

KELLY
Im sorry Ive never drank like that

stuff And with the boat--

JAKE
Oh yeah you think You think maybe

maybe not the best idea you ever had in the
world

KELLY
Oh thats right all this was my idea

JAKE

chance for a masters degree in sex here I

hell is so wrong with that

KELLY

JAKE
But you -- they just want to exploit you
And you let them

41

KELLY
And if I never had I never wouldve--

She catches herself Turns to the sink splashing water on her
face chastising herself in the mirror--

KELLY (cont’d)
Cant believe I made out with a girl I
am so pathetic--

JAKE
Well actuallythat was kind of hot

KELLY
I knew it I knew thats what you wanted
God -- such an idiot I cant believe I

Her voice is so angry it takes him a full two seconds

JAKE

KELLY
Yes Jake Did you really think I wanted to
hang out with Derrick the cokehead

JAKE

Jakes amazed All this time he thought he was the one afraid
to make that first move

KELLY

Wiping her tears she looks up a him with him with a smile

KELLY

And when they finally break hes true and sincere

JAKE (contd)
Now lets go bring you back home

42 INT LAKE VICTORIA PET EMPORIUM - DAY 42

An insistent KNOCKING at the door Mr and Mrs Goodman enter
from a side door turning on lights and opening the door--

--to see Julie and Novak bedraggled and shell-shocked with
Fallon behind them Novak carries a WATER BUCKET--

MR GOODMAN
Sheriff--

But before he can finish his sentence Julie grabs the bucket
from Novak and BURSTS IN to slam it on the counter

JULIE
What the hell is this doing in my lake

MR GOODMAN
(looks in incredulous)
Where did you get this--

NOVAK
In the middle of the lake Where two
people are dead

Mrs Goodman gasps puts a hand to her heart Julie spins to
Fallon with his radio ready

JULIE
Try to cordon off the south end all the way
to the dam Use fishing nets dredge nets
whatever the town has Try to work from
Sand Island to Lookout Point

FALLON
Ill have Bob Gordon prep emergency shutoff
of the spillway--

JULIE
The second we have approval from the
Governor I want a full evacuation No
boats no swimmers nothing -- everybody
out of the goddamn water Lets pray its
contained downstream to the south--

Fallon exits All the while Mr Goodman has been focused on
the fish Fascination in his eyes He dumps the bucket into an
empty AQUARIUM TANK revealing the captured PIRANHA

MRS GOODMAN
Oh my

NOVAK
Oh my -- yeah oh my Oh my they just tore
two friends of mine apart Thats things
a piranha isnt it

MRS GOODMAN
(to Mr Goodman)
Carl Someone mustve released it into
the lake--

JULIE
Its not the only one there were more--

NOVAK
(his ripped bloody wet suit)
You fuckin see this There were thousands

MRS GOODMAN
Ive heard of this happening Its like
those baby alligators in New Jersey
Someone leaves them and they breed--

MR GOODMAN
No one released this fish into the wild

His grave mesmerized tone stops them all His gaze remains
locked on the piranha swimming beyond the glass 42

MRS GOODMAN
Carl how do you know that

MR GOODMAN
No one on earth couldve bought this fish

JULIE
What are you talking about

MR GOODMAN
This particular piranhavanished off the
face of the planet more than two million
years ago

He takes off his glasses and looks above the exotic fish area
to a large FOSSIL OF A GIANT FISH hanging high on the wall

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
Allow me to introduce you to Pygocentrus
nattereri The first piranha The
original piranha

Goodman retrieves his stepladder and climbs it to bring the
fossil down Skeletal remains embedded in a stone cross-cut

MR GOODMAN (contd)
My father worked construction on Parker
Dam They found fossils like this when
they first broke ground He gave this one
to me for my eighth birthday They used
to swim the Colorado River right up until
the Pleistocene Epoch

Novak grabs the fossil and compares it to the live fish Both
specimens have many things in common

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
I still dont understand how you found one
alive

NOVAK
We discovered a subterranean lake through a
rift that the quake opened up

MRS GOODMAN
But how could they survive for so long cut
off from the surface

MR GOODMAN
By eliminating and feeding off of all the
other species

JULIE
And then what

42 42

MR GOODMAN
Cannibalism They must have fought each
other to survive Look at all those scars
on his scales And notice the eyes

Mr Goodman comes closer to the tank where our prehistoric fish
is agitated and annoyed by his confinement But when Goodman
stops moving the piranha stops moving too

JULIE
Jesus Its like hes staring back

MR GOODMAN
Not staring Sensing Centuries spent in
darkness must have rendered them blind
And forced them to reactto movement

Goodman slightly touches the water- The piranha turns back right
away and starts hitting the glass of the tank to break free
revealing his open angry jaw

MR GOODMAN (cont’d)
Piranha hunt in packs Not for protection
but for overwhelming force Theyre
organized Methodical The first bite
draws blood The blood draws the pack

JULIE
So how can we stop them

MR GOODMAN
Theyre killing machines but theyre still
fish You can catch them or kill them
But if there really are thousands

NOVAK
Yeah

MR GOODMAN

Yesterday would have been a good time to
start

EXT COPPER CANYON - OTHER SIDE OF LAKE - SAME TIME 44

At that time of the day Copper Canyon is crowded with spring
breakers Empty beer cans float all around the boats and jet-
skis Different kinds of music are coming from everywhere

On one of the boats a cute redhead barely eighteen is drinking
her first beer bong while some other guys (including MATT and
his group) moon each other from deck to deck

Deputy Fallons PATROL BOAT navigates through the armada of
party-ers on boats inner tubes and jet skis

A large crowd has gathered a few hundred yards from the shore
around the floating stage which hosts the afternoon attraction-

DIVER 1
(to his nervous friend)

PULL OUT to REVEAL - she is 200 feet in the air dangling from a
parachute A para-sailing speedboat pulls her along

THE DRUNK GIRL looks down at all the activity below
The boat SLOWS as DRUNK GIRL drops in altitude Her feet drag

in the water for a few moments before the boat picks up speed
again lifting Drunk Girl into the air

EXT WATER BUG - DAY - MOVING 53

An exuberant vibe Andrew drives the boat while Derrick follows
Drunk Girl through his camera lens Meanwhile Jake guides
Kelly back topside Shes woozy an icepack held to her head

Derrick THUMPS the camera into his chest -- then leads Crystal
to a starboard bench for a COCAINE break

With no other choice Jake points the camera the speed boat
slows dipping Drunk Girl again before lifting her back up
And now shes waving at someoneso Jake TILTS THE CAMERA DOWN

He says it low confidingly Causing Jake to look to the back
of the boat where Danni and Crystal primp and preen But
Derricks not watching them His cold stare is on Jake

INT UNDERWATER - DAY 56

Back to the main spring break locationwhere just below the
surface a MASS OF PIRANHAS swims towards the spring breakers
We see INNER TUBES from below where ringed asses in bikini
bottoms hang like ripe fruit

EXT FLOATING STAGE - DAY 57

A SORORITY GIRL floats in one of the inner tubes and suddenly
reacts with a YELP as if pinched And then pinched again She
raises her butt out of the water to find a better position--

--as Julies patrol boat arrives on scene to join Fallons
Julie sees the surge on the water approaching the swimmers--

JULIE
Oh my god Theyre heading straight for
them

NOVAK

(scans with binoculars)
Theres two more schools moving further up
Do you see them

JULIE
Theyre surrounding us Weve gotta get
these kids out of the water

Watching the wet t-shirt contest THE SAME SORORITY GIRL IN THE
INNER TUBE CHEERS at the action on stage -- then GETS SUCKED
DOWN ASS-FIRST THROUGH HER RING Nobody really notices at
first Nor when a SECOND SWIMMER disappears further away

But the then the BLOOD SURFACESand swimmers now edge back

DRUNK DUMB JOCK
Holy fuck Shark SHARK

DRUNK LAUGHING JOCK
Who the fuck yells shark in a lake

But the confusion isnt comical for long -- as a slow-building
panic spreads through the crowd WHEN THE BUTCHERY STARTS FOR
REAL MORE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR INTO THE LAKE GALLONS OF BLOOD
SPREAD ACROSS POOLS OF BUBBLING WATER-

What was panic a few seconds ago now turns into terror-
EVERYBODY CLIMBS ON THE STAGE MAKING IT WAY TOO HEAVY PEOPLE

START TO PULL THEMSELVES ON THE TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WHICH
SWINGS BACK AND FORTH

57

Its the human race at its worst- people crying screaming
pushing and fighting each other for the smallest life saving
space

TOP-HEAVY THE STAGE IS OFF BALANCE A WAVE OF HYSTERIA SPREADS
OVER THE CROWD AS THE STAGE COLLAPSES THE WET T-SHIRT GIRLS
SLIDE INTO THE WATER

Stage right hanging to one of the monitor speakers the DJ
looks as the whirlpool of blood turns the water full of flesh
hair and hemoglobin

DJ
Shit man Somebody stop this thing Oh
fuck Oh fuck dude

Cables pop sparks fly when- One of the audio towers tumbles
into the lake hitting a boat full of college kids-

A cable holding up a lighting rig snaps with tremendous force
and flies across the water-

THE CABLE SLASHES A BOAT OF BIKINI GIRLS INSTANTLY SEVERING
ARMS AND OTHER BODY PARTS SENDING THEM INTO THE WATER TO THE
FEASTING PIRANHAS

THE CAMERA CRANES OVER THE BLOODY MOSHPIT BUT SCREAMS OF AGONY
HAVE REPLACED THE ROCK MUSIC

EXT LAKE- CONTINUOUS 58

Meanwhile the drunk parasailing girl still floats in the air
bare breasted

The boy driving the boat pulling her slows down when he sees the
unusual activity around the floating stage

BOY
(to his friends)
Look what the hell is going on

The boat comes to a stop-

SEEN FROM UNDERWATER- DRUNK GIRL DIPS BACK DOWN INTO THE LAKE

The two other boys in the boat stand to look out at the horizon
trying to understand whats happening over there-

They dont notice that behind the boat the parasailing girl who
is fully submerged starts to SCREAM and WIGGLE as the water
bubbles around her

BOY (contd)
Lets get out of here

58

The SPEEDBOAT STARTS UP AGAIN REVEALING BEHIND THEM-—

A LIFELESS DRUNK GIRL lifted up into the air -- the FLESH FROM
HER BOTTOM HALF HAS BEEN EATEN AWAY

EXT JULIES BOAT - DAY

As Julie drives her boat into the fray Novak pulls out their
first rescue- a YOUNG WOMAN with bite marks so terrible its
hard to tell if she will survive Julie abandons the helm

---to help pull more survivors out of the water- kids SPLASHING
desperately for her boat Their bodies are mutilated The fish
are everywhere attacking from all sides as Julie draws her GUN

Bang Bang Bang The bullets get through the water into the
school of fish killing just a few

JULIE

(to Novak)

You know guns
NOVAK

JULIE

Take the shotgun behind you

Novak grabs the shotgun and pumps it- Hes been waiting was for
this all day-

Ka-ching - Bang He starts shooting but the fish are
everywhere Novak and Julie fire again and again other fish
EXPLODE above and underwater Novak then spots something

NOVAK
(leaps up on railing)
Theres too many kids still in the water

JULIE
Novak what are you doing

As she watches Novak LEAP RIGHT OFF her boat He SPLASHES DOWN
into the water -- and surfaces just in time to GRAB the throttle
of an abandoned JET SKI It REVS out of the water just in time -
- as PIRANHA CHURN the water right on Novaks heels--

--as Novak SWEEPS the SKI into a crowd of FLEEING TEENS He
grabs a GIRL helps her aboard--

NOVAK
Grab another person Make a chain

The rescued GIRL clutches him around the waist reaches a HAND
back gripping another GIRL A GUY grabs her legs a GIRL grabs
his legs and moreand Novak REVS the Jet Ski ahead--

--pulling a human chain of a DOZEN WOUNDED SWIMMERS out of
harms way faster than the piranha can swim

---although the last GEEKY KID in the chain (I cant believe my
parents paid for this) is not so lucky SCREAMING as PIRANHA
sever his arms at the elbows The kid falls back doomed
while his FOREARMS survive still clutching some girls ankles

BACK ON JULIES BOAT Now out of ammo Julie grabs her tazer
gun She FIRES into the water-

THE ELECTRONIC PULSE SPREADS ON THE SURFACE AMONG THE SCHOOL OF
FLAPPING FISH- FISH EYES EXPLODE GUTS BURST A FEW PIRANHA
ARE INSTANTLY CHARRED AS THE ARC OF POWER BLAZES THROUGH THEM

EXT LAKE - CONTINUOUS

In the hysteria everyone tries to climb out as best they can
by grabbing on to anything outside the water-

THERE IS SO MUCH BLOOD UNDERNEATH THAT EVEN THE FISH ARE
CONFUSED AND START ATTACKING ONE OTHER

CUT TO

Two girls fight to get back on their boat when another vessel
loses control slamming one girls head and crushing it between
the two crafts Blood splatters on the other girl who screams in

terror

EXT LAKE SHORE - CONTINUOUS

A HEAVY BREASTED GIRL (THE TRAMPOLINE GIRL) RUNS PANICKING OUT
OF THE WATER TRIPPING OVER A FLOATING CORPSE SHE FALLS IN FRONT

OF THE CAMERA IN JUST A FEW INCHES OF WATER- ENOUGH TO BECOME
ANOTHER TASTY MEAL FOR THE PIRANHA

EXT JULIES BOAT - SAME TIME

Out of arsenal to fight back Julie continues to pull victims
out of the water sitting them next to other bloodied shaking
and shell shocked kids

JULIE
Oh Godwe dont have enough boats

62

Her boats like a refugee craft with its deck totally full and
others hanging off the side CLINGING to its rails--

EXT FLOATING STAGE - DAY 63

--while Novak SWEEPS his JET SKI near the beach allowing his
human chain to scamper to safety He then TURNS BACK to try
and pick up more one hand FIRING the shotgun--

--while Matt (who has managed to survive so far) jumps off the
tilting stage onto a small motorboat-

WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO MANEUVER HE RUNS PEOPLE OVER SLICING
THEM UP WITH HIS PROPELLER ATTRACTING THE PIRANHAS AND STARTING
ANOTHER FEEDING FRENZY-

--and sending his motorboat right into the path of Novaks JET
SKI Novak SWERVES at the last second sent off-balance Hes
tipping over right toward a GNASHING BLOOD-CLOUD--

--but he THROWS HIS WEIGHT INTO THE ROLL AS HIS JET-SKI ROLLS
UNDER IN SLO-MO to see PIRANHA CHARGING RIGHT AT HIS FACE --
except his MOMENTUM CONTINUES THE ROLL a full 180 back up to
the surface -- and Novak regains control of the Jet Ski

--while behind him Matts boat gets stuck after just a few
yards When he checks the engine Matt finds a girl trapped
beneath the boat with her hair tangled in the propeller

SHE SCREAMS AS SHE DROWNS- HER SCALP TORN FROM THE SKULL

Matt unmercifully tries to start the engine without ever
attempting to help When he looks up Matts face freezes- a
crowd of screaming swimmers heads in his direction (Including
the Fratboy Driver and Friends who encountered Julie) BUT
BEFORE MATT CAN REACT THE CROWD IS ALREADY ON THE BOAT LIKE AN
ARMY OF ATTACKING ZOMBIES

The boat is too small and the swimmers only manage to turn it
upside down Matt climbs onto the overturned hull- His body
COVERED WITH PIRANHAS

EXT DEPUTY FALLONS BOAT - CONTINUOUS 64

The second police boat is close to the beach which is
overwhelmed with fleeing screaming college kids Amidst the
chaos Deputy Fallon FIRES into the water--

But the fish are too numerous and the bullets have little impact-
Deputy Fallon looks around with desperation Young Deputy Green
sits in a corner of the boat crying utterly broken

64

What more can Fallon do Looking down at the outboard motor he
suddenly gets an idea- In a series of quick actions he-
DISMOUNTS THE ENGINE BY UNSCREWING ITS BRACKETS-—

REMOVES HIS BELT SLIPPING IT INTO THE GAS TANKS HANDLE-

SLIPS HIS ARM THROUGH THE BELT AND CARRIES THE GAS TANK UNDER
HIS SHOULDER-

FINALLY WITH BOTH HANDS FREE HE GRABS THE ENGINE AND LIFTS IT
OFF THE BOAT-

With a determined look on his face he revs the engine a few
times SPINNING THE PROPELLER OUTSIDE OF THE WATER AND JUMPS
INTO THE KNEE-HIGH WATER WITH HIS NEW IMPROVISED WEAPON-

A FISH CHAIN SAW

FALLON
CHEW ON THIS FUCKERS

HOLDING THE MOTOR FIRMLY IN HIS HANDS FALLON DIPS THE PROPELLER
INTO THE WATER TEARING THE PIRANHAS INTO A MILLION PIECES

DEPUTY FALLON
(to the swimmers)
GET TO THE BEACH HURRY COME ON

Fallon saves many of the victims as the Piranha are attracted to
the bloody carnage he creates More and more of the fish
surround him their sheer numbers slowly overtaking him

Now safe on the sand a YOUNG NERDY GIRL whom Fallon just saved
witnesses him start to lose the battle

PIRANHAS COME AT HIM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS FINALLY BRINGING HIM
TO HIS KNEES THE HEROIC DEPUTY SCREAMS IN AGONY AS HE
DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE SURFACE

ALONG THE BEACH PEOPLE RUN OUT OF THE WATER WITH MISSING LIMBS

WHILE OTHERS TRY TO HELP THE VICTIMS AND DRAG BLOODIED BODIES
ALONG THE SAND Its D-Day all over again

EXT JULIES BOAT - MOMENTS LATER 65

She sinks wordlessly to her knees shaking as the camera
dives under the surface to reveal-

WIDE SHOT OF THE UNDERWATER BATTLEFIELD THE SHOCKING VISION OF

Jake descends with the kids and Kelly She finds some cold
water in the galley gives it to the thirsty kids

JAKE
Kelly I want you to rest down here -- and

Zane moves away his attention drawnto the GLASS BOTTOM area
He carefully steps onto it getting a great underwater view He
looks for fish but sees nothing but rocks and floating weeds

SUDDENLY THE BOAT JERKS AND STUTTERS THE ENGINES CONSTANT
HUMMING FALLS SILENT

DERRICK (0S)

DERRICK (0S)

Jake Kelly and Laura all look to the deck seeing Derrick pass
The drinks drugs and hot sun have become a toxic angry mix

KELLY
Jake maybe you should wait on that
conversation
The engine cranks and sputters but fails to turn over

Zane returns his attention to the transparent bottom when-

THE SCHOOL OF PIRANHAS JET BY THE GLASS SCARING HIM

LAURA
What was that

Zane turns to Laura who has snuck up behind him
ZANE

Laura and Zane huddle around the glass bottom when Andrew
appears

UNDER THE WATER -- Andrew works desperately to unravel the weeds
from the propeller

Meanwhile on deck Derrick slugs from a TEQUILA BOTTLE surly
and slumped at the helm He watches Danni and Crystal as they
stand on opposite sides of the boat and using oars attempt to
keep it from hitting the protruding rocks nearby

DERRICK (cont’d)
Hey bitches Get the Sand Rat up here

Danni and Crystal trade a suddenly worried look

DERRICK (cont’d)
I SAID GET HIM FUCKING UP HERE

JAKE (0S)
Why dont you do it yourself

Jakes now standing at the stairs to the cabin Fully emerges
Derrick slugs his tequila again The sense of a showdown

DERRICK
I was just sitting here thinking kid How

He sets the bottle down unsteadily stands And approaches

DERRICK (cont’d)

Danni and Crystal laugh That seals it Derrick STORMS forward
-- Jake tries to back up but Derrick GRABS him by the throat
marching him backwards toward the stern of the boat--

JAKE (contd)
Hey Derrick hey HEY

--and Derrick holds him OVER THE RAILING HALF-SUSPENDED over
the water where neither notices the SHADOW OF FISH below--

DERRICK
If anyone should be down there helping it

IN THE WATER -- Using a knife Andrew continues hacking through
the weeds He can see the kids waving at him through the glass
when-

SUDDENLY A LARGE MASS OF FISH BLOCKS HIS VIEW The PIRANHA

Where Derricks ready to hurl Jake overboard

DERRICK

---and just as he starts to shove Jake over they hear SCREAMS--

INT THE WATER BUGUNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Zane and Laura scamper away from the glass-bottom in horror at
the sight of Andrew being ATTACKED by the PIRANHA He
disappears in a whirlpool of blood guts and flopping fish

He struggles to swim up but the piranha EAT THROUGH HIS AIR
HOSE Oxygen EXPLODES out of the tank and thrusts HIS BODY HARD

AGAINST the glass like a rocket--

The GLASS BOTTOM EXPLODES SENDING THE TWO KIDS DIVING FOR THE
STAIRS TO THE DECK

KELLY HITS HER HEAD AGAINST THE WALL KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS

The boat quickly tilts to one side just as Zane and Laura race
upwards and the RUSHING WATER immediately cuts off the stairway
exit leaving unconscious Kelly trapped below

EXT WATER BUG - CONTINUOUS

AT THE SAME TIME EVERYONE ON THE BRIDGE IS JOLTED BACK JAKE
ALREADY HAD HOLD OF A RAILING BUT THE OTHERS GO SLIDING --
WITH DERRICK THROWN ONTO HIS BACK TUMBLING TOWARDS THE WATER-

AS HE SLIDES HE GRABS CRYSTALS LEG AND PULLS HER INTO THE WATER
WITH HIM
UNDERWATER

Derrick sinks like a stone before gathering himself and finding
his bearings- He turns around and-

COMES FACE TO FACE WITH CRYSTAL AS SHES ATTACKED BY THE
PIRANHA

73

She fights valiantly but the fish are too numerous- She tries to
hold on to Derrick but he claws her face and pushes her away

CRYSTALS EYES OPEN WIDE AS A BIG FAT PIRANHA COMES OUT OF HER
MOUTH STRETCHING HER JAW WIDE OPEN

TERRIFIED DERRICK SWIMS BACK TO THE SURFACE HE GRABS THE THE
BOATS RAILINGS AND TRIES TO PULL HIMSELF OUT WHEN-

THE PIRANHAS ATTACK HIS LEGS
Derrick screams and hangs on to the boat with all his strength

Zane and Laura rush over to help him But in his panic Derrick
GRABS Lauras arms pulling her out over the water--

--just as Jake and Danni leap to grab her legs Lauras ina
human game of tug-of-war She screams in total terror--

JAKEDANNI

DERRICK

Jake GRABS AN OAR and BASHES Derrick across the arms He lets
go SPLASHING back down Danni pulls Laura to safety Then
Jake extends the oar again not giving up on Derrick--

JAKE
The oar Grab the oar

Derrick does and Jake manages to haul him back on board but
Danni almost faints when she sees- HIS LEGS HAVE BEEN DEVOURED
AND THE PIRANHA GNAW AWAY AT HIS TESTICLES

JAKE (contd)
What the hell Those are piranha
(to Zane and Laura)
Guys get outta here Get to the helm

MEANWHILE AS THE PIRANHAS FINISH CRYSTAL HER SILICON IMPLANTS
FLOAT TO THE SURFACE

The kids run off and Derrick screams for his life while--

DANNI PICKS UP A SECOND OAR AND BOTH SHE AND JAKE BEAT THE
PIRANHA FLAPPING ON THE DECK WHILE DERRICK CONTINUES SCREAMING

UNDERWATER 74

Within the school one of the piranha swims away from the pack
with a precious piece of human flesh in its jaw-

DERRICKS SEVERED PENIS BUT ANOTHER FISH COMES AND STEALS IT
WITH DELIGHT THE PIRANHA SWALLOWS THE SEVERED MEMBER-

BURP

INT WATER BUG - CONTINUOUS

With water rushing in from every direction it SLOSHES against

Jake appears at the top of the steps about to descend when he
looks into the swirling water where HUNDREDS OF RAVENOUS PIRANHA
ARE FINISHING WHAT LEFT OF ANDREWS BODY CIRCLING IN THE BLOODY
WATER WAITING FOR THEIR CHANCE TO CHOW DOWN- IMPOSSIBLE TO GO

Julie spins trying to stave off the panic Then spots a ski
boat among the floating carnage -- still in pretty good shape
JULIE

Without hesitating Julie steps over the railing and jumps onto
an abandoned boat She LEAPS from one barge to the next making
her way to the ski boat

---and then turns in surprise to see Novak standing there Hes
followed her route right behind her

NOVAK
Not worried at all

Julie starts the boat instantly- they take off

EXT SPEED BOAT - CONTINUOUS 82

The speed boat is almost there When theyre thirty yards away
Julie signals for Novak to stop

JULIE
We cant go any further Theyve drifted
into those rocks

Julie and Novak stand on the side of their boat watching the
Water Bug as it continues to sink in a field of protruding
rocks She musters her confidence

JULIE (contd)
Weve got to try a rescue anyway

Julie and Novak search for anything that can help She finds
life jackets oars skis Novak spots A WATER SKI ROPE

NOVAK

out and untangles it on the ground

JULIE
(yelling)

IT TO THE TOP LEVEL OF THE BOAT

JAKE
(screaming back)

Novak swings the handle bar side of the ski rope above his head
until he launches it toward Jakes open arms- But the rope falls
short landing in the water

JULIE
Dammit Try again

JAKE
Its too short

NOVAK
TRY USING THE OAR TO PULL IT IN

Jake extends the oar overboard and paddles the rope over to him

The Piranha attack the rope

JAKE
Get off Get the fuck away

Jake successfully lifts the rope into the boat-

JULIE

AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN OK
JAKE

Novaks stripped off his shirt and is unbuckling his pants

JULIE

Jake has secured the ski rope to a chrome hand rail connected to
the boats roof when suddenly-

THE BOAT SHIFTS ON THE ROCKS WHERE ITS MAROONED JOLTING
EVERYBODY ON BOARD

EXT SKI BOAT - CONTINUOUS 84

The outboard engine on the ski boat REVS At the helm Novak
uses the throttle to keep the connecting tow line tight

NOVAK
OK

With her radio belt-strapped across her chest Julie takes hold
of the ski rope swings legs above and crosses her ankles

Hanging upside down she slowly slides from the ski boat toward
the Water Bug She glances to the water where a school of
PIRANHAS track her every move

On deck Jake and Danni scramble extending hands to help Julie
as she finally makes it on board She signals to Novak -- he
slows the engines Zane and Laura rush to hug their mom

JAKE
Im really sorry Mom I screwed up bad

JULIE
Well deal with you later Is this
everyone on the boat

LAURA
Kellys stuck down there In the cabin

JULIE
Kelly -- our Kelly From school

Julie rushes toward the cabin skylight -- passing Derricks
bloody remains She grabs a un-inflated LIFERAFT to cover him--

JULIE (contd)
Jake keep the kids away--

ZANE
Are we all gonna die-- Like him

--then reaches the skylight seeing Kelly trapped below still
atop the stove with the WATER RISING all around her

JULIE
Kelly stay still Dont panic Can you
reach the skylight Can you grab my hand

KELLY
Its not big enough I wont fit through

DANNI
What about something to float on -- that
life raft

JULIE
Inflate it and it wont fit through the
door Shell still be trapped when the
whole boat sinks--

Kelly SCREAMS as water sloshes onto the stove PIRANHAS flipping
over each other to nip at her feet She edges higheras Julie
finally looks overboard face grim voice low

JULIE (contd)
The only way to her is through the bottom
(rallies the others)
The rest of you -- get back to the rope

JAKE
You cant leave her down there

JULIE
We have to save the ones we know we can
save Im sorry Jake Once we get across
that rope Ill come back for her--

JAKE
Im not leaving Mom Not without her

JULIE
(grabs him)
Jake Jesus Christ you cant get to her
without getting in the water And I will
not let you do that Were not giving up
but just get to the ROPE

She physically shoves him toward the rope but he spins out of

her grasp

Holds his ground

JULIE (contd)
That was an order

JAKE
I wont leave her Mom
(beat)
Im the reason shes here

84 84

Julie stares at him -- and for the first time in her life she
sees the man shes always hoped her teenager would be

NOVAK
Guys The rope line wont hold forever
Whoevers coming better do it now

JULIE
(to Jake at last relents)
Let me get Zane and Laura across and then
Ill be back and well do it together

Without waiting for an answer she rushes to the edge of the
boat where the ski rope is TIED Directing Danni

JULIE (contd)
Well keep the little ones between us You
go first if you think you can do this

DANNI
Better fuckin believe it I dont pole
dance for nothing

Danni grips the rope with both hands and swings her legs around
it in a lithe fluid motion As Julie looks back to Jake

JULIE
You have a lot of explaining to do

Danni pulls and slides herself ahead Julie grabs Laura then
Zane -- securing their hands and feet on the rope--

JULIE (contd)
Okay gang its like at the playground
Hand-over-hand and youll be there Just
dont look down do you hear me Hand-over-
hand you do not look down--

The kids nod too scared to speak They start edging their way
across Julie leaves her radio here grabs the rope herself and
starts after thembut takes a quick glance down -- causing her
ankle-lock to slip as HER FEET FALL SPLASHING INTO THE WATER
She YELPS as she lifts them back up KICKING off two fish--

ZANE
She looked down Mom looked down

LAURA
Mom do not look down ALL RIGHT

Julie manages to get her legs locked again Close call

JAKE
Theres more of them coming From
everywhere

UNDERWATER

The silhouettes of Danni Zane Laura and Julie are outlined
above the surface and progressing on the rope while-

In the foreground dozens of NEW PIRANHA arrive alerted by the

disturbance Julie caused in the water

BACK TO THE SURFACE

On the other side Novak must increase engine power as the rope
bends toward the water But on the other side unnoticed yet
THE RAILING HOLDING THE SKI ROPE STARTS BREAKING Not good

Novak turns around watching Danni almost reaching the ski boat
while Zane and Laura are close to the halfway point when-

THE PIRANHAS START JUMPING OUT OF THE WATER CLACKING THEIR
TEETH TRYING TO BITE THEM ALL

Julie lifts herself higher on the rope freezing- THE FISH JUST
INCHES AWAY Danni is not so lucky-

WITH EACH JUMP THE FISH TEAR A PIECE OF FLESH FROM HER BACK
ITS GRUESOME AND TERRIBLY PAINFUL Screaming in a panic
Dannis instinct is to try and reverse course--

JAKE
KEEP GOING FORWARD DONT STOP

LAURAZANE JULIE
(stuck by her bottleneck)
DANNI KEEP MOVING KEEP GOING

DANNI
I CANT I CANT GET THEM OFF SOMEONE
HELP ME OH MY GOD NO IM BLEEDING

NOVAK

THE BLOOD DRAWS EVEN MORE FISH DIRECTLY BELOW HER STRUGGLING
TO KEEP MOVING HER HANDS SLIP AND THE TOP HALF OF HER BODY
FALLS INTO THE WATER WITH HER LEGS STILL CLINGING TO THE ROPE

SHE FIGHTS OFF THE FISH WHO ATTACK HER FACE AND TORSO

The kids are petrified watching Danni fight for her life

86

JULIE
GET UP GET UP

DANNI LIFTS HERSELF OUT OF THE WATER EXPOSING HER DISFIGURED
FACE JUST FOR A MOMENT BEFORE-

HER LEGS WEAKEN LETTING HER FALL INTO THE WATER WHERE SHE IS
INSTANTANEOUSLY DEVOURED

JULIE (contd)
Laura Zane At me -- LOOK AT ME Keep
moving YOURE ALMOST THERE

SMOKE STARTS TO BILLOW FROM NOVAKS OVERHEATING ENGINES AS THE
RAILING HOLDING THE SKI ROPE KEEPS BENDING ITS NOT GONNA HOLD
FOREVER

NOVAK
COME ON KIDS HURRY

But the trembling kids are petrified frozen until they heed
their moms wordsand finally meet her eyes

JULIE
Laura and Zane Forester listen to me when
one bites you it doesnt hurt Do you
hear me When one bites you it doesnt
hurt They can only hurt you as a pack

The idea seems to snap the kids back to life -- they resume
their hand-over-hand for the ski boatas PIRANHA LEAP OUT
trying to snare them RIPPING TINY NIBBLES of their backs--

--the kids CRY OUT but just shut their eyes and keep coming--

JULIE (contd)
(getting BIT herself)
THAT WAS ONLY ONE THAT WAS ONLY ONE OF
THEM SHUT YOUR EYES KIDS ITS ONLY
ONE

--and they do eyes shut picking up the pace sure and steady
until they start edging higher as the rope reaches the ski boat
And then theyre in Novaks grasp Zane and Laura are safe

And then just as Julies about to join them--

THE RAILING BREAKS ON THE WATER BUG THE SKI ROPE SLIDES AWAY-

PLUNGING JULIE IN THE WATER

The ski rope still tied to the broken railing ultimately gets
blocked into another part of the boat- 86
THE ROPE STRETCHES AGAIN OUT OF THE WATER BUT-

JULIE LOSES GRIP AND FALLS INTO THE PIRANHA JUST AS NOVAK
GRABS HER HAND AND PULLS HER OUT RIGHT BEFORE THEY SWARM

Zane and Laura clutch their mom with desperate relief

JULIE (contd)
Its over now -- its over -- were safe--

Novak eases on the engines And now Julie spins remembering--

JULIE (contd)
JAKE CMON YOU HAVE TO--

--but to her shock she sees the SKI ROPE now untied from the
Water Bugs broken railing and now tied around Jakes waist

Jake has purposely SABOTAGED the only route across

JULIE
But Jake itll take you way too long to

JAKE
The piranhas want blood So lets give

Aboard his boat Jake marches toward the UNINFLATED LIFE RAFT
left covering Derricks corpse--

NOVAK (0S)
Kid listen these little fuckers cant
see They react to motion Do you hear

Just as Jake kneels and casts the life raft aside--

AND DERRICKS GHASTLY VISAGE LUNGES A HAND OUT TO CLUTCH JAKE BY
THE THROAT PALE AND BLOODY EYES WIDE FOR HIS FINAL WORDS

DERRICK
(a tortuous struggle)

And he dies Jakes heart just skipped a beat but he recovers
Re-wraps the raft around Derricks mangled remains--

JAKE
Good news Youre about to make a
contribution to society

--and he lifts and throws him over the starboard side--

Hey fishies Come and get it 88

--and then immediately runs for the port side himself lowering
himself into the water While the water around Derricks CORPSE
FOAMS RED AND WILDLY CHURNS

INT WATER BUG - CONTINUOUS 91

Kellys about to climb down from her perch to enter the water

Manages to find his moms floating waterproof radio

Jake spots an EMERGENCY KIT on a wall above the water line-

JAKE
Wait one sec I might have found

He goes to the emergency kit and tears it open revealing a set
of waterproof FLARES which he quickly unwraps

KELLY
Jake what are we waiting for The piranha
are gonna come back

JAKE
Dont move Ill be back in a second

He dives back down to the propane tanks where- he turns the
knobs opening them and releasing large gas bubbles toward the

sinking cabin

Jake swiftly resurfacesjust as Kelly notices the intense flow
of bubbles coming from underneath the water

KELLY
Jake what is that It smells like gas--

JAKE
Listen to me When I say go youre gonna
take one final breath and were gonna swim
out through the bottom Then you have got
to hang on tight Hang on to me

Jake finds a DISHRAG from the galley detritus and uses it to tie
the waterproof flare to his moms floating radio-

JAKE (contd)
(on the radio)
Youre clear to pull us out in 10 seconds
OK Do you guys copy

NOVAK (0S)

Remembering the words Novak shouted to him Jake puts a finger
to her mouth -- indicating for Kelly not to move a muscle

CUT TO
Novaks engine still wont start

NOVAK
Come on Start dammit

CUT TO

THE PIRANHAS SURROUND JAKE AND KELLY WHO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TO REMAIN STILL

One piranha swims out of the pack and comes closer to Jake
almost nose to nose

Terrified he can see the ugly features of the prehistoric fish
and his two milky blind eyes The fish bumps into him a couple
of times testing him

Jake knows the slightest move means certain death Petrified
Kelly is clearly running out of breath

The piranha finally turn back and swim away

Quickly Jake ignites the FLARE which is tied to the floating
radio and releases it back inside the hull--

INSTANTLY THE PACKS FLIPS BACK AND CHARGE THEM

Above the lake the Water Bug is ON FIRE The ski boat stops as
Novak turns the vessel around to retrieve Jake and Kelly

Go get him Julie

In a swift maneuver he swings the boat close Julie Zane and
Laura reach overboard to help Jake and Kelly onto the boat--

--as they cough up water and take deep breaths That was as
close as it gets Novak helps Jake up their first real meeting

NOVAK (cont’d)

Glad to have you on board

Jake takes a second to catch his breath Overwhelmed by emotion

Jake smiles back at her--

--as Kelly takes his hand Shes still shocked and scared so
Jake holds her He seems far older than the kid we first met
Kelly slowly regains her calm and dares to look overboard- The
piranhas are gone The water is still-

Suddenly A DEAD PIRANHA POPS UP TO THE SURFACE

ZANE
Look look mom Over there

They all stand to see- Another piranha popping up further away
and another and another

Seen from underwater thousands of dead fish are silhouetted by
