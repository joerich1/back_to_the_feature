FADE IN ON
CYBERSPACE

We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
sky thats just beginning to get light There are a few
stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
computer sun starts to rise

We continue hurtling through space and see that were heading
over a computer version of the New York City skyline We
move over Central Park Its fall and the leaves are
glorious reds and yellows

We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
turn onto a street in the West 80s

Hold in front of a New York brownstone

At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
words

ADDING ART

As the rectangle starts to fill with color we see a percentage
increase from 0 to 100 When it hits 100 the image pops and
we are in real life

EXT NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

Early morning in New York A couple of runners pass on their
way to Riverside Drive Park

We go through the brownstone window into
INT KATHLEEN KELLYS APARTMENT - DAY

KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep Kathleen 30 is as pretty and
fresh as a spring day Her bedroom cozy has a queen-sized
bed and a desk with a computer on it Bookshelves line every
inch of wall space and overflow with books Framed on the
childrens classic Madeleine

As Kathleen wakes up her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
the room He wears blue jeans and a workshirt Hes carrying
the New York Times

KATHLEEN
Good morning
FRANK
(as he reads)
Listen to this -- the entire work force

of the state of Virginia had to have
solitaire removed from their computers --

Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
bathroom and we stay with Frank

FRANK
(continuing)
-- because they hadnt done any work in
six weeks

Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe

KATHLEEN
Arent you late

FRANK
(continuing)
You know what this is you know what
were seeing here Were seeing the end
of Western civilization as we know it

KATHLEEN
This is so sad

She tosses him his jacket

FRANK
(points at her computer)
You think that machine is your friend
but its not
(checks his watch)
Im late

INT LIVING ROOM - KATHLEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
As Frank walks to the apartment door We see a charming room
with a couch fireplace books and a dining table with a

typewriter with a cover on it

KATHLEEN (0C)
Ill see you tonight

KATHLEEN (0C)
Great Bye

Frank goes out the door It closes

Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
peephole watching as he goes down the stairs disappearing
from sight She walks into

INT KATHLEENS BEDROOM - DAY

And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
street and turns toward Broadway

Hes gone Good

She sits down at her computer An expression of anticipation
and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse

INT COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleens
code name Shopgirl She logs on and the computer makes all
its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
number and connects and we hear the machine

COMPUTER
Welcome

And we see Kathleen listening for the words shes waiting to
hear

COMPUTER (contd)
Youve got mail

And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up

INT COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

We see a list of letters

Big Cash Op You can make in your spare time OIL MKT You
can turn 20 into 20000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT

Kathleen hits the delete key and the first three letters --
all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen

Then she selects the Read Mail key for NY 152 Brinkley
And the letter comes up

To Shopgirl
From NY152
Re Brinkley
Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud

KATHLEEN
Brinkley is my dog He loves the streets
of New York as much as I do --

And now we hear Kathleens voice replaced by the voice of
NY 152 a man named JOE FOX --

JOE (VO)
-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
and bagel off the sidewalk and I prefer
to buy them Brinkley is a great catcher
and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
team --
(continued)

INT JOES APARTMENT - DAY

A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor This
is BRINKLEY The pillow has Brinkley embroidered on it
Brinkleys master JOE FOX a great-looking guy full of
charm and irony comes into the kitchen and pours himself
some orange juice Hes half-dressed

JOE (contd)
-- but he chose to stay with me so that
he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
a large green pillow the size of an inner
tube Dont you love New York in the
fall It makes me want to buy school
supplies I would send you a bouquet of
newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
name and address On the other hand
this not knowing has its charms

VOICE

Joes girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN in Armani head to toe comes
into the kitchen and turns on the 2000 espresso machine
which starts grinding beans Shes carrying the morning
papers

Hold on Joe listening as he hears the elevator door open and
close on the landing outside

IT JOES DEN - DAY

As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs
on

JOE and THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)

And as he starts to read his letter we hear

KATHLEEN (VO)
I like to start my notes to you as if

conversation I pretend that were
the oldest and dearest friends --
as opposed to what we actually are
people who dont know each others names
and met in a Chat Room where we both
claimed wed never been before

INT JOES ELEVATOR - DAY
As Joe dressed for work takes the elevator down with his

yelling obscenities at the other Kathleen unlocks the door
to the store

KATHLEEN

Christina looks at her puzzled

of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland etc Theres a
playful display of witches lit with twinkle lights covered
with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading The Ten Best
Witch List and a collection of witch books -- The Lion The

The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
piece of machinery so perfect --

Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
marching through the streets of Paris She looks at it then
looks up lost in thought We hear the sound of the computer
keys

KATHLEEN (VO)
Sometimes I wonder about my life I lead
a small life Well not small but
circumscribed And sometimes I wonder
do I do it because I like it or because
I havent been brave So much of what I
see reminds me of something I read ina
book when shouldnt it be the other way
around

As they walk toward the back of the cafe Kathleen notices a
stack of loose-leaf binders on the table

CHRISTINA
What if they put us out of business

Men For Women Women for Men Women for
Women -- what is this
CHRISTINA
You fill out one of these forms and they
file it in the book and if someone wants
to meet you they arrange it

KATHLEEN
What a stupid way to meet someone

CHRISTINA
Compared to the Internet

KATHLEEN
My little thing on the Internet is just
a lark

CHRISTINA

So its still going on

KATHLEEN
And I do not plan to meet him
(indicating the book)
Why do I get the feeling that you are in
here somewhere

Christina flips the book open to her application

CHRISTINA
I came in here one night and drank too
much coffee and filled one out
(off Kathleens look)
Well how am I supposed to meet someone

KATHLEEN
You are a runner Some day you will make
eye contact with another runner and --

CHRISTINA

KATHLEEN
The worst the worst -- I could never
under any circumstances love anybody
who had a sailboat

CHRISTINA
Neither could I

KATHLEEN
If I had to get up on Saturday morning
knowing that I was about to go down to
the pier and unravel all those ropes and
put on all that sunblock --

CHRISTINA
All that talk about the wind

KATHLEEN
And then you have to go out on the boat
and you sail and sail and sail until you
are bored witless and then only then
do they say lets turn around and you
realize the trip is only half over only
its not because the wind has changed --

CHRISTINA
It hasnt changed Its died

KATHLEEN
So then theres more talk about the wind
While you just float up and down trying
not to get nauseous And when you
finally get back you have to clean up
the boat

CHRISTINA
Why dont people have boat maids

KATHLEEN
I know Therere all these people who
wouldnt be caught dead polishing a
doorknob in their house but put them on
a boat and they want to rub down
everything in sight

Annabel who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
looks at the handkerchief a little puzzled

ANNABEL

KATHLEEN

The world is not driven by discounts
believe me Ive been in business
forever I started helping my mother
here after school when I was six years
old I used to watch her and it wasnt
that she was selling books it was that
she was helping people become whoever
they were going to turn out to be When
you read a book as a child it becomes
part of your identity in a way that no
other reading in your life does

(stops herself)
I guess Ive gotten carried away

JOE
You have and youve made me feel

He cant finish the sentence He looks at her and sees
behind her on the shelf a picture of a woman who is
unmistakably Kathleens mother with a young Kathleen

No one looks up except Frank

FRANK (VO)
-- and I suddenly saw him sitting
directly across from me doing the
crossword puzzle

KATHLEEN (VO)
Howd you know it was him

FRANK (V0O)
He looked exactly the same as his high
school yearbook picture which happens to
be the last photograph ever taken of him

Frank takes out his billfold on the subway pulls out a piece
of paper

CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
of William Spungeon at 17

Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
across the way They dont look remotely alike except that
the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
wearing the same style glasses
The subway stops at 79th Street and William Spungeon gets off

puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters

INT JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As the two of them eat dinner

FRANK
What I was thinking as I was trailing him
was that eventually I would have the
courage to say hello to him you know
not in a horrible intrusive or slavering
fan-slash-acolyte kind of way but more

like Hi How ya doing Have you
ever thought about trading up in the sock
area Who knows maybe hes read my
work -- and then wed become friends and

eventually Id introduce him to you --
you know how much he loves childrens
books theres a whole long section in
Relativitys Smile about The Wizard of Oz
-- and then maybe hed come out of hiding
so he could help save the store

tough he could help rally support --

of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
full of its own virtue that I was instantly
compelled to rush over and check it out

small at the table as he eats his soup

JOE (VO contd)
My mother died when I was ten I was
staying with my father who is not famous
for intimacy and whose way of breaking
the news of her death was to tell me she
would not be coming to pick me up as
usual It was a car accident and I
dont know where she was going or who she
was with and I assume what I owe her is
my tendency to cover almost any emotion
with a joke A useful gift unless you
want to know what youre feeling She
was very beautiful People toss that
word around a lot but my mother was

The camera moves closer to the dining table We see that
tears are rolling down little Joes cheeks

whole point of being out of the house is
so you can miss whats on television

behind

Kathleen is shocked at herself

JOE
What is it

KATHLEEN
I just had a breakthrough and I have to
thank you for it For the first time in
my life when confronted with a horrible
insensitive person I actually knew what I
wanted to say and I said it

JOE
I think you have a gift for it It was a
splendid mixture of poetry and meanness

KATHLEEN
Meanness Let me tell you --

JOE
Dont misunderstand me Im just paying
you a compliment

He lifts the book off the table Kathleen grabs for it

KATHLEEN
Why are you doing this

She manages to get the book leaving Joe with the rose

JOE
What have we have A red no crimson
rose tucked into the pages Something
you read about in a book no doubt One
of those books with a lady in a nightgown
on the cover about to throw herself off a
cliff

She holds her hand out for it

KATHLEEN (contd)
Give it to me

Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache
JOE
Its a joke to you isnt it
Everythings a joke to you

She grabs the rose Puts it back in the book

KATHLEEN (contd)
Please leave I beg you

He stands up walks from the table sits down at the very
next table with his back to her

The door to the restaurant opens Kathleen looks at it
hopefully A pleasant looking man whos immediately joined
by a pleasant looking woman

For a moment Kathleen looks just a little droopy as if the
wind has just gone out of her sails She takes out her
compact looks into her mirror She slides it over to look
behind her at him just as hes looking sideways at her He
turns away suddenly

Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief

JOE
You know what the handkerchief reminds
me of The first day I met you --

KATHLEEN
The first day you lied to me --

JOE
I didnt lie to you --

KATHLEEN
You did too --
JOE
I did not --
KATHLEEN

I thought all that Fox stuff was so
charming F-O-X

JOE
I never lied about it --

KATHLEEN

Joe Just call me Joe As if you were
one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
with no last name Hi Im Kimberley
Hi Im Janice Whats wrong with
them Dont they know youre supposed to
have last names Its like theyre a
whole generation of cocktail waitresses

She stops herself -- its a tangent she never meant to go off
on But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
table

JOE
I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

KATHLEEN
Thats not what I meant --

JOE
And when I said the thing about the Price
Club and cans of olive oil that wasnt
what I meant either --

KATHLEEN
Oh you poor sad multimillionaire I
feel so sorry for you

The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
in a boa comes in the door

JOE
I am going to take a wild guess that this
isnt him either Who is he I wonder
Not I gather the worlds greatest
living expert on Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg but someone else entirely
Will you be you be mean to him too Will
you start out sweet as sugar candy and
then suddenly miraculously like a bolt
from the blue find that sharp little
tongue of yours

KATHLEEN
No I wont Because the man whos
coming here tonight is completely unlike
you The man who is coming here is kind
and funny -- he has the most wonderful
sense of humor --

JOE
But hes not here

KATHLEEN
If hes not here he has a reason
because there is not a cruel or careless
bone in his body I cant expect you to
know anything about a person like that
Youve nothing but a suit

A beat Joe gets up

JOE
That is my cue Good night

Joe leaves

Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face

She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her

Or an automobile accident Those cab
drivers are maniacs

CHRISTINA
They hit something and you slam right
into that plastic partition

KATHLEEN
His elbows could be in splints -- so he
cant really dial --

CHRISTINA
Or he could be in the hospital in one of

CHRISTINA and KATHLEEN
(together)

They look at George Still shaking his head

KATHLEEN

(to George)
What

GEORGE (contd)
He was arrested two blocks from the

cheesecake place

CHRISTINA
Is there a picture

There it is Its of a man with his jacket pulled over his
head

They all look at it

CHRISTINA
So that explains it

GEORGE
He was in jail

CHRISTINA
And there was a phone --

GEORGE
-- but he got only one call and he had to
use it to call his lawyer

CHRISTINA
You are so lucky

GEORGE
You could be dead

KATHLEEN
Are you crazy This man couldnt
possibly be the rooftop killer

CHRISTINA
Remember when you thought Frank might be
the Unabomber

KATHLEEN

KATHLEEN (VO)
And as I waited someone else showed up
a man who has made my professional life a
misery and an amazing thing happened --
I was able for the first time in my
life to say the exact thing I wanted to say
it And of course afterwards I felt
terrible Just as you said I would

INT JOES APARTMENT - LATER
The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads

KATHLEEN (VO)
I was cruel and Im never cruel And
even though I can hardly believe what I
said mattered to this man -- to him Im
just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
it did No matter what hes done to me
theres no excuse for my behavior
Anyway you are my dear friend and I so
wanted to talk to you I hope you have a
good reason for not being there last
night but if you dont and if we never
really connect again I just want to tell
you how much it has meant to me to know
you were there

Then he hits the Menu key and signs off

Sits looking at the blank screen

JOE

He clicks the Yes box
Then he starts to type again

JOE (VO)
Dear friend I cannot tell you what
happened to me last night but I beg you
from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
for not being there

He deletes for not being there
Then types again after to forgive me

JOE (VO)
-- for what happened I feel terrible
that you found yourself in a situation
that caused you additional pain But Im
absolutely sure that whatever you said
last night was provoked even deserved
And everyone says things they regret when
theyre worried or stressed You were
expecting to see someone you trusted and
met the enemy instead The fault is
mine
