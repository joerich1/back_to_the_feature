CUT TO

INT US ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DAY
Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN the US Attorney for the
Southern District of New York

BEN

Based on his symptoms and the test

results Id say brief psychotic

disorder -- if it persists possibly

schizophreniform disorder And Dr

Cutler agrees with my diagnosis
CHAPIN

So hes crazy

BEN
Dr Cutler No hes annoying but --
CHAPIN
Vitti
BEN

Not crazy At least not permanently
In certain people continuous exposure
to an extremely stressful situation --
soldiers in combat for instance
disaster victims a hostage situation
or being locked up in a maximum
security prison with someone trying to

ill you -- it can produce a temporary
psychotic state
CHAPIN
How temporary
BEN
A day a week up to a month -- if the
precipitating stressors are removed
CHAPIN
(musing)

Which means hes not going to get any
better while hes still in the can
BEN
He could get worse He could
deteriorate to the point where hed be
permanently schizophrenic
CHAPIN
Then Id say hes got a real problem
because he goes before the parole
board in four weeks

BEN
You think theyll let him out

CHAPIN
Oh yeah Im sure theyll want to
release a major Mafia figure whos now
totally deranged on top of it

BEN
(thinks)
Well couldnt you release him to a
halfway house or some place where he
could get some decent treatment
Based on my earlier work with him I

dont think hes dangerous and I
think he was making a real effort to
reform himself

CHAPIN
You do huh
(thinks fora
long moment)
Okay Then Ill tell you what Im
gonna release him into your custody

BEN
Mine Me No this is a bad time for
me My father just died -- and Ive

got this bulging disc in my neck --
and were redecorating which is a
total nightmare I cant --

CHAPIN

You want to see him killed in prison
BEN

No of course not
CHAPIN

Or sent to a facility for the
criminally insane

BEN
No --

CHAPIN
Then hes all yours Im going to
talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get
you certified as a temporary federal
institution
BEN
(stricken)
What I cant be an institution
CHAPIN
(firm)
Youve got thirty days to get him in
shape for his parole hearing That
means sane sober and gainfully
employed But let me warn you
Doctor If he fucks up in any way --
if he flees or if I find out that
this whole thing was just a setup so
he could get back on the street and
return to a life of crime -- I will
hold you totally responsible and Ill
see that you are stripped of your
license and prosecuted to the full
extent of the law Are we clear
BEN
(gulp)
Yes Were clear

CHAPIN
You still want him
BEN
(long beat to
decide)
Yes
