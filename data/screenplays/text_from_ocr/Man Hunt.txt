EXT COASTAL ROAD - NIGHT

OPEN on a highway road in a remote coastal town We see CAR HEADLIGHTS
approach

and we see its a CONVERTIBLE with the top down an old 60s sportscar beat-
up but

cool

The driver is JIM TRUDELL he winds his way down the road

Hes in good shape and carries the look of a man who has seen and done much
in his

32 years

The road is desolate except for a lone ROADHOUSE BAR up in the distance

Jim sees
it and heads toward it -

CUT TO
EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT
As Jim approaches it we see the lot littered with bikers and Harleys -
regulars

Jim slows down and pulls up into the driveway -

We see two large men LURCH and WEENER stagger out the front door They are
very

drunk and looking for trouble

Jim gets out of his car and coolly surveys the rowdy bar

Lurch stops and looks ahead - he sees Jim approach the front door He slaps

Weener
on the arm -

LURCH
How much you give me to fuck with
this guy

WEENER

How about nothin

LURCH
Youre on

Jim approaches the front door Lurch greets him gregariously -

LURCH
A hearty good evening to ya Theres a
50 dollar cover charge tonight

Jim nods realizing theyre drunk He heads toward the front door but Lurch
stands in front of him blocking his access

Jim smiles weakly at the idiot simply wanting to get by

JIM
Funny

LURCH
Didnt you hear what I said

Jim goes to head in but Lurch stops him by jamming his HAND into Jims CHEST

Lurch smiles at him -

LURCH
Fifty bucks

Weener muffles a laugh Jim smiles and calmly moves Lurchs hand away -

JIM
Yeah I remember when I had my
first beer - goodnight guys

Lurch grabs Jim by the arm and yanks him back outside--he shoves his palm
into
Jims chest again--HARD--knocking Jim backwards--
LURCH
You should watch your attitude
around here

In a flash Jim grabs the manss hand twisting the wrist backwards sending
Lurch
to his knees--

JIM
Thanks for the advice

CUT TO
INT BAR - NIGHT

The bar is smoky loud and crowded He winds his way through the unruly
crowd to
the bar

He sees a SKELETAL LEATHER-FACED BARTENDER pouring whiskies and beers
He is at
the other end of the bar serving a customer

Jim scans the bar POOL PLAYERS BIKER MUSIC a rowdy crowd
Then suddenly something catches Jims eye - he tracks it across the room

We see a sexy WOMAN enter--the head of every local patron turns in her
direction

Shes clearly out of place in this establishment as she heads through the
crowd

arrives at a payphone and makes a call

Jim eyes her as the bartender approaches him She hangs up apparently
frustrated
She seems apprehensive about something

BARTENDER
What can I get ya

JIM
You know the nearest place to stay
around here

BARTENDER
(shrugs)
South of here I dunno

JIM
You know about how far down

BARTENDER
(irritated)
What do I look like a travel
agent Now you want to order or
what
Jim reacts to the non-information he just received Hed just as soon leave
but
he sees the woman make her way toward the bar not really noticing Jim

Jim gestures to the tap -

JIM
Give me a beer

The bartender pours the shot and plunks down the beer

BARTENDER
Three

Jim pays and the bartender goes to the cash register

The woman waits for the bartender and looks over at Jim then scans the room
before looking up at the TV behind the bar

Jim takes this opportunity to inconspicuously glance at the woman - she takes
note
of Jim - she is very sexy a mysterious air about her

She looks forward at the TV -

The bartender looks over the girl as he approaches her

BARTENDER
What will it be darlin

WOMAN
Stoli and tonic

BARTENDER
(stone-faced)
We dont have - Stoli - and

I just ran out of tonic
She looks at him -

WOMAN
How about a glass of water Or are
you out of glasses

The bartender smirks and gets her some water Jim and the woman exchange
looks -

JIM
Its that kinda service thatll
keep me comin here

The woman smiles faintly and looks ahead preoccupied--

LURCH(OS)
Hey Hot dog

The woman turns around to see the group surrounding them WEENER
three

LURCH and

big mean BIKERS Lurch stares at Jim The others ogle the woman -

The bartender scowls at the two men -

BARTENDER
I told you two to get outta here

Lurch stares down the bartender with hostile eyes

LURCH
Make us ya old fart

The bartender grabs a sawed-off bat under the bar but one of the bikers

slams the
bartenders hand to the counter -

Lurch then directs his attention to Jim and the woman

LURCH
Hot dog thinks he owns the place

Jim shakes his head to himself as if he knows whats gonna happen - its

routine
to him

The woman senses real trouble but turns away and plays it cool
LURCH
Whats your name sweet thing
(gestures to Jim)
Are you with chickenshit here Huh

Weener cackles along with the three other goons surrounding them
his
cool

LURCH
Huh

Lurch staggers then gains his footing

WEENER
I think shes ignoring you Lurch

LURCH
Excuse me but Im talking to you
Are you ignoring me

Then finally the woman slowly turns and looks Lurch up and down
WOMAN
Now why would I want to ignore
a fat drunken slob like you

Jim keeps
Lurchs buddies go Oooooohhh and laugh at this affront but Lurch is not
amused

LURCH
You know I ought to teach you
some manners
Lurch grabs the woman by the arm and YANKS her close to him

Jim moves yanking Lurchs hand off the girl and staring him down -

JIM
Thats it Shows over

Lurch SWINGS - Jim DEFLECTS the punch and SMASHES Lurch across the face -
Lurch crashes to the ground -

Lurch staggers up and whips out a SWITCHBLADE people back up -

The woman looks at Jim fearing the worst -

Lurch takes a furious drunken SWING at Jim -

Jim DUCKS and POW - grabs Lurchs wrist -

Jim SLAMS the blade down into the felt of a POOL TABLE before delivering a
COMBINATION that sends Lurch spinning and crashing into a table of drinks -

BIKER 1 SWINGS his mallet fist at Jims face but Jim SLAPS it to a stop
twists it
hard - tendons SNAP as Jim flips him on his ass -

Weener LUNGES and GRABS Jim around the waist sending them to the ground -

Jim FLIPS Weener off of him and rolls to his feet - as Weener staggers up and
Jim
lands a DEVASTATING ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the skull which DROPS him -

BIKER 2 approaches from behind but Jim BACKHANDS his face -

BIKER 3 CONNECTS with Jim across the jaw - Jim LASHES INTO HIM with a
combination

that SHATTERS his nose -

Lurch SPRINGS to life brandishing a POOL CUE - people clear-

Lurch charges Jim SWINGING the cue furiously - we hear it WHIPPING through
the air

Jim waits for the right time before GRABBING the cue and wrenching it out of
Lurchs hands -

Weener approaches from behind and Jim JUTS the back of the cue into his ribs
- we

hear a bone CRACK - Jim SMASHES him to the ground turning around just as
Biker 2
CHARGES -
Jim STABS the back of the cue into the bikers face and a LIGHTNING FAST kick
sends

him colliding into the barstools -

Lurch makes a final charge and WHAM Jim SHATTERS the pool cue over Lurchs
skull
ending the melee

Jim holds the broken cue looking for anyone else who wants to start up - no
one

does

Then Jim looks toward the woman - she stares hard at him -

He surveys the destruction - throws the pool cue to the ground -

The bartender runs around the bar

BARTENDER

Jim nods and takes off toward the door -

The woman watches him leave

At the end of the alley there is an old bearded HOMELESS MAN asleep and
wrapped in

a blue plastic tarp Next to him is a shopping cart full of broken junk and
grungy

clothes

Jim approaches the cart and gingerly digs through it - he finds a small old
ripped

FLANNEL SHIRT which he takes out - he also finds a DIRTY SOCK (or rag) - he

ties

the sock tight above his wound - the man STIRSsuddenly we hear the sound

do you mind if I close the door

We did a little digging on Jim Trudell

at Sergeant Zydowskis request

Hes 31 no priors and hes been working
for the military for ten years

We ran the id I could have told you that

CRAIG
I dont think you understand
I dont mean shuffling papers in an
office I mean Jim Trudell worked
classified assignments special
forcessabotageuntil last year
He was brought up on charges of
espionage but the charges were
later dropped and he sprang the
service

DOYLE
(surprised)
Yeahwell what are you getting at
You saying he has an agenda down here

CRAIG
Our agency monitors all threats very
carefully and theres good reason
to believe Jim Trudell has the training
the connections and the experience
to present a clear threat to the public
if he remains at large

DOYLE
If what youre saying is true then why
would he have killed two police officers
A man like that would want to lay low
if he was planning some kind of damn
sabotage mission

CRAIG
Thats the point He slipped up and
hes desperate now And that means
hes all the more dangerous

The two men look at each other

CRAIG
Im sure if our departments
cooperate we can find out the truth

Cooperate
