mar-rang” So named by the Turuwal
tribe of Aboriginal peoples to
whom it means “throwing stick”
This design hasnt changed for four
thousand years Better
aerodynamics than any fiberglass
sport boomerang

HENDERSON
You don’t say

Boomerang Guy throws it again

BOOMERANG GUY
NASA scientists studied it and came
away stumped They couldnt
explain how it works

Henderson eyes the boomerang as it makes its long arc
Boomerang Guy’s not paying attention--

r BOOMERANG GUY (CONT’‘D)
An Aboriginal hunter can knock a
wombat out of a eucalyptus tree at
200 yards Then his bou-mar-rang
returns to his hand as if drawn by
an invisible thread

He cockily puts up his hand without looking--

The boomerang sails past him and knocks a UNICYCLIST into a
ditch Henderson smiles

SWEATER LADY

looking for dead mice

BARRY
No Most of these guys come from a
lab out in Jersey They just use
them up and throw them away

He looks tenderly at the pictures

I like to think I‘m giving them a
second chance In the words of
John Lennon “You may say Ima
dreamer but I‘m not”

TIM
The only one

BARRY
The only what

TIM
That’s the quote “You may say I’m
a dreamer but I’m not the only
one”

BARRY
(condescending)
I don’t think so Tim

Dale comes back with the nose epoxy

TIM
How many mice have you stuffed

Finally he gets it under control

BARRY
He thinks youre crazy You had
one good night of sexual
intercourse and it was years ago

JULIE
I don’t believe this

BARRY

JULIE

BARRY
HE DOES GO AWAY

Julie stomps to the elevator

JULIE
Tell him he can kiss my ass

INT TIMS APARTMENT NIGHT

A knock at the door Tim answers Barrys standing there

cockily

Barry saunters past Tim into the apartment

BARRY
Problem solved

TIM

BARRY

I gave your stalker a dose of tough

love She got the message

TIM
Darla came here

BARRY
Yes

TIM

Tim stares at him amazed

TIM
Thank you
(grudgingly)

He stretches out on the couch

BARRY (CONTD)
Where do you think Julie is

TIM

I don’t know She had some work

thing

Tim glances at the CATALOGUE of Kieran’s show lying on the
coffee table Barry picks it up--

BARRY

TIM
She curated his show

BARRY
Shes going to see this guy
Tonight After you had a fight

TIM
I don’t know

Barry examines Kieran--

BARRY
The Other Man
TIM

BARRY
The Other Man is always just a

friend She needs a shoulder to
cry on He sees his chance He
strikes Next thing you know

the Ground Round Never mind that
he’s fat and bald and your
cubicle’s only three feet away and
you have to listen to them having
phone sex all day when youre NOT
EVEN SUPPOSED TO MAKE PERSONAL
CALLS AT THE OFFICE

Tim dials Julie’s cell Straight to voicemail He hangs up
BARRY (CONTD)
Call his house See if she’s

there

TIM
No

BARRY
It’s the only way to know

TIM
If I call him looking for her he’s
gonna wonder why she’s not
answering her cell and he’s gonna
realize theres something wrong
And if she is there and theres
nothing going on then she’s gonna
think I’m snooping around and he’s
gonna be able to see that she’s mad
at me and then he‘ll definitely
know that something’s wrong

BARRY
You’re like a chess master Youre
seven moves ahead of everybody

Barry thinks

BARRY (CONTD)
I’1l1 call him

TIM
Definitely not

BARRY
Did I not take care of your stalker
problem

TIM
Why would you be calling him

BARRY
Maybe I want to make a movie about
him You know his adventures how
he became a famous photographer

Tim snorts

TIM
He’s such an egomaniac hed
probably go for it

He thinks
TIM (CONT’D)
If I tell you exactly what to say
do you think you can do it
BARRY
Sometimes I think you think Im an
idiot
Beat

TIM
Tell him you’re making a
documentary and you want to
interview him Then casually say
youd also like to talk to the
woman who curated his show

Barry stares blankly

TIM (CONTD)

convey a profound sadness

seven thousand dollars in an s-
Corporation Audit the bastard

hesitate to mention it But I
assume you realize Zimmer‘s having
an affair

Barry stops

THERMAN (CONTD)
Not only that but his mistress
broke up with him in Key West on
March 12

Barry and Tim stare Therman plucks the Twizzler from
Barry’s hand and takes a bite

He types into his computer and peers at a list of Whitmans
Barry points--

BARRY

TIM
You know what Let’s keep focused
on the reason we came here

Therman peers at his screen then closes his eyes in
meditation A beat He opens his eyes and smiles at Tim

THERMAN

very subtle But you can’t swap
capital gains on derivative trades
for a loss in a non-shareholder-
owned LLC Any child knows that

little boy

He spanks Tim

TIM

history buff with a pompous air Hes wearing a t-shirt that
says “RISK The Game of Global Domination” and carrying a
huge TROPHY

They get out of the car laughing As they pass Tims
Porsche they see Barry crouching down--

You didn’t screw up Well you
did But you tried

Barry says nothing
TIM (CONTD)

Come on Barry Youll find

Gabriels “Mercy Street” plays soulfully He comes over and
sits next to Julie on the couch--

the lotus position as an ELEPHANT gently touches his
forehead with its trunk

INT TIMS PORSCHE — DAY

Tim looks at the piece of paper with Barrys address He
jams the car into gear and peels out

EXT BARRY’S HOUSE - EVENING

Barry trudges wet and bedraggled up to his crappy suburban
ranch house

INT BARRY’S HOUSE - EVENING

Barry comes in the door He looks around at his few pieces
of cheap furniture A clock TICKS depressingly

INT BARRYS BASEMENT - EVENING

Barry comes down the stairs and opens a door--

And enters another world

Rolling hills Forests Lakes and rivers Roads and towns
An entire world in miniature populated by hundreds of

TAXIDERMIED MICE

They ride bicycles buy treats at candy stores float in hot
air balloons go to school get married raise families

Barry gazes at the landscape a god among his creations

He looks sadly at the HUSBAND MOUSE staring sadly as his
wife drives off in the Mazda Miata Then tears streaming
down his face Barry opens up the spigots--

The water rises slowly covering the Husband Mouse ‘Then
pours into the nearby town Streets fill with water
Buildings collapse One by one the mice disappear under the
rising flood

Sobbing Barry reaches up through cotton ball clouds and
yanks down the ROPE holding the stars and planets in their
orbits The universe crashes down tiny lights winking out

Barry gazes at the rope in his hands Then eyes the rafters
overhead

EXT BARRY’S HOUSE - EVENING
Tim jumps out of his Porsche and races to the front door
INT BARRY‘S HOUSE - EVENING

Tim steps inside and looks around--

TIM
Barry

He hears the sound of rushing water from the basement
INT BARRY’S BASEMENT - EVENING
Tim pushes open the door--

In the middle of his ruined world Barry stands on a chair
noose around his neck

TIM
BARRY

BARRY
What are you doing here

TIM
Barry let me explain--

BARRY
There’s nothing to explain I
understand perfectly I hope you
remember what you’re about to see
for the rest of your life

TIM
Barry no

Barry steps off the chair--

And lands harmlessly on the ground The rope is way too
long He slumps depressed

TIM (CONT’D)
Barry listen to me Yes
originally I invited you to dinner
because I thought you were an
idiot Why do you think I
disinvited you

Barry thinks
TIM (CONTD)
Maybe because I realized you
weren‘t an idiot after all

Barry looks skeptically at him

TIM (CONTD)
Don’t you see Once I saw how
smart and talented and witty you
are I realized you were of no use
to me So I tried to get rid of
you

BARRY
I guess that does make sense

TIM
I should have treated you better
I acted like a bastard

BARRY
Yeah You did

TIM
You know Barry When my dad was
dying he said to me “Tim youre
gonna be a big success someday”
This dinner was my shot I know
it’s juvenile I know it’s mean
But if I could hold my own with
those guys Id be set And my dad
would look down on me and hed
say “You did it Timmy You did
it”

Barry looks at him moved

TIM (CONT’D)
Anyway it’s not your problem I
really just came to say Im sorry

BARRY
Maybeyou could find someone
else

TIM
No Theres no time It’s over
(looking heavenward)
Sorry dad I tried

He turns to go

TIM (CONTD)
UnlessNo I wouldnt ask you to
do that

BARRY
What

TIM
I dont know It’s crazy
Unlessyou could pretend to be an

idiot
Barry thinks

BARRY
But would it be believable

TIM
You’re right Forget it

BARRY
I meanI’d have to really turn on
the acting

TIM
Its insane

BARRY
So insane it just might work

He winks

BARRY (CONTD)
Let‘s go to dinner

Tim grins and dials his cell phone Barry steps forward and
the rope goes taut yanking him off his feet He flails
clutching his neck and gurgling

He raises his glass--

He nudges Barry and chortles Barry glares at him

The WAITERS come in and set appetizers in front of everybody
including the Dummy who has his own place setting--

Each large white plate has a single shrimp in the center
The head still on The Winners watch the Losers--

The Sweater Lady peers at her shrimp Its beady eyes peer
back The Vulture Lover eyes his six forks uncertainly

BORMAN
We like to start out these evenings
with a question to the group
Tonights question is what’s the
one thing youre most proud of

Litman nudges the Beard Champion who’s trying to pry his
shrimp’s shell off with his butter knife--

LITMAN
I think I can guess what yours is

BEARD CHAMPION
The ‘97 Beard Olympics Took the
silver medal by only three points
Talk about a close shave Close

that You know how it goes Hair
today gone tomorrow

The Winners laugh encouragingly--

Priceless

BEARD CHAMPION
Youve heard of the hair of the dog
that bit you How about a bit of
the hair that dogged you

He grabs his beard and makes it paw at the Boomerang Guy--

He thinks there’s a dying animal on
your face

Our departed animal brethren have
much to tell us If we only
listen

WAITERS serve plates of steak tartare The Sweater Lady eyes
the raw beef

WAITER
Steak tartare madam

SWEATER LADY
Um-I think you forgot to cook it

Caldwell makes the soft “ding” of a point being scored

The Pet Medium places her hand on Tims steak tartare and
closes her eyes Tim frowns

PET MEDIUM
It’s dark I’m going down a chute
I can hear the others mooing
They’re afraid--NO The bolt has
smashed my skull But I’m still
alive They’re cutting off my
skin I try to scream but theyve
cut off my tongue-

She gives a silent raspy SCREAM Then slumps to the table
Everybody pushes their steak away
Fender grins proudly Tim nudges Barry--

wondering what that smell is

conquered the world literally
hundreds of times Is there a
particular battle you’re proudest
of

Sid Carmichael smiles

SID CARMICHAEL
I’d consolidated my grip on Europe
and I set my sights on the fairest
prize of all Iceland Whose
fertile fields belie her frigid
name

He looks directly at Barry--

SID CARMICHAEL (CONT‘D)
I knew my opponent was desperate
If he lost her he would lose
everything But he was not man
enough to keep her Again and
again I thrust my armies against
her rocky shores until finally I
penetrated her virgin grassland

Barry gazes at him trembling

SID CARMICHAEL (CONTD)
Soon she was on her knees before
me And I took her without mercy

Robin fans herself--

ROBIN
Whew It’s getting hot in here

SID CARMICHAEL
Well it is true what they say
Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac

He points to his own reflection in a mirror

BARRY (CONT’D)
‘Cause he looks like a total idiot

He winks at Tim and sits down shooting a triumphant look at
Sid Carmichael Bobby Brandt frowns at Tim Tim shrugs
nervously

The Waiters come in with plates of pasta topped with small
lobsters Barry picks up his lobster and chomps down on it
CRUNCHING the shell between his teeth

SID CARMICHAEL
Barry you’re supposed to take the
meat out of the shell

HENDERSON
Here let me show you--

He demonstrates using a lobster fork

BARRY
I’m such an idiot

He takes the meat out Then pops the shell in his mouth and
chews staring steadily at Sid Carmichael

SID CARMICHAEL
I see we have two dummies at the
table

The Dummy gets up as if to fight but the Mime holds him
back

Barry whispers to Tim--

BARRY

whispers to Litman--

Barry grins at Tim and “chalks one up” Bobby Brandt frowns
Fender shoots Tim a look

Robin and Litman exchange suspicious looks Tim shifts
nervously

BARRY (CONTD)

Barry gets a strange look on his face The Beard Champion
leaps away from him in disgust--

BEARD CHAMPION

faking

BORMAN

head

The Losers look at each other confused

BARRY

How do I put this

He takes a deep breath--

BARRY (CONTD)
All of you people are losers We
invite you to these dinners to make
fun of you

The Losers stare at their hosts shocked and betrayed

BEARD CHAMPION
I see

He neatly folds his napkin

BEARD CHAMPION (CONTD)
I was taught to say thank you when
someone has me to dinner But
under the circumstances I think
I’ll just say goodbye

The Pet Medium gathers her purse--
PET MEDIUM
You should be ashamed of
yourselves

The Sweater Lady looks at Robin and blinks back tears--

The Boomerang Guy SLAMS his fist down on the table

BOOMERANG GUY
BASTARDS

He whips out a boomerang and hurls it at Henderson
Henderson ducks The boomerang hurtles around the dining
room-—

Sid Carmichael steps up to Barry--

SID CARMICHAEL
You think you’re funny Barry
Let’s see if you think this is
funny--

He cocks back his fist--

and the boomerang NAILS him in the head knocking him
unconscious

ALVAR
That was pretty funny actually

Sid Carmichael slumps into the Mime knocking his Dummy to
the floor The vulture utters a horrid CRY and swoops down

on it

VULTURE LOVER
He thinks it’s a dead baby

The Mime lunges after the vulture tipping a candle over onto
the Inventor’s box of smokable ice cream A shower of
sparks The Sweater Lady SCREAMS as her sweater ignites
Acrid smoke billows across the table

BARRY
THE LOSERS ARE OUT OF CONTROL

The Winners hurry out Tim tries to follow but the
Boomerang Guy blocks his way

He STOMPS on Tims bad foot Tim HOWLS in pain He STOPS on

The Boomerang Guy starts pounding Tim as Sound Effects Guy
provides accompaniment

the sound effects for his own pounding

Tim drags himself away on his elbows

Tim crawls painfully down the hall all hell bréaking loose
behind him Ahead the Winners file into the safe room The
heavy metal door closes slowly--

raised high above his head He brings it down with a YELL--

Everything goes dark

He lays Tim on the ground at Julie’s feet

BARRY (CONT‘D)
In the last few days I’ve gotten
to know Tim pretty well I know a
lot of people think he’s a complete
loser I disagree I saw the look
on his face when you left him
Anyone who can love somebody the
way Tim loves you is no loser in my
book

Julie looks at Tim

BARRY (CONTD)
My wife left me last year I
thought my life was over The only
thing that kept me going was some
dead mice from a dumpster in
Jersey But Tim doesn’t even have
that If you leave he wont have
anything

Tim and Julie look at Barry deeply moved

TIM

You‘re wrong Barry I ama loser
I don’t deserve either of you

(he looks at Julie)
JulieIf you walk out that door
I don’t blame you But I want you
to know Ive lost everything My
job The people I thought were my
friends And the only thing I want
back is you

She looks at him her eyes shining

JULIE
You had me at “I‘m a loser”

Barry blinks back tears--

BARRY
Come on Big hugs

He puts his arm around Julie and awkwardly pulls her to the

floor for a three-way hug with Tim

Suddenly Julie shrieks The Mouse pokes its head out of

Barry’s pocket

BARRY (CONTD)

Don’t worry That‘’s just my

friend

He holds up the Mouse It’s wearing a little suit that looks
just like Tim’s Barry looks at Tim--

BARRY (CONTD)
He got a second chance after all

He whispers in the Mouse’s ear--

BARRY (CONT’D)
There’s food in the kitchen

He puts the Mouse down Tim and Julie watch as it scurries
into the kitchen

TIM
Maybe everything does happen for a
reason Maybe I had to learn that
it’s more important to be good than
it is to be rich

BARRY
Of course the best thing would be
to be good and rich Like Kieran

JULIE
You know after you left he said
he wanted to photograph me doing
yoga Naked With a wildebeest
I caught the next bus back to the
city

BARRY
One thing I‘ll say about Kieran
Great guyterrible taxidermist

They look at him confused He grabs Kieran’s book and
points to a picture of Kieran and the elephant--

BARRY (CONT’‘D)
I mean duh C-29 hippopotamus
eyes It’s amateur hour

JULIE
That son of a bitch

Tim and Julie look at each other They crack up
JULIE (CONTD)
(to Barry)
Lets get him to the couch

She grabs Tim’s arms and Barry grabs his legs and they start
to carry him to the couch

BARRY
And just to clear this up About
Tims other girl It was one
night Two years ago And it’s
over

Julie stops She stares at Tim furious

JULIE

Two years ago That’s interesting
TIM

Julie--
JULIE

“I would never cheat on you Julie
I love you”

TIM
We had just started going out I

didn’t know how serious we were
gonna get

Julie drops Tim His head SLAMS to the floor

JULIE
Goodbye Tim

She grabs her suitcase and walks out

BARRY
I messed up

Tim stares murderously at him
BARRY (CONT’D)
Tim don’t worry I’m gonna take

care of this

TIM
You idiot

THE END
