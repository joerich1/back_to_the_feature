judgment Remember all prisoners

was Devlin in business for himself
selling protection to the airlines
El Al was the only one that refused
to pay So he made an example of
them No different than the mob
torching a hold-out shop in a
neighborhood

They pass around a photo of SEAN DEVLIN - lanky Irishman -
pale skin - stringy black hair and wild eyes A Celtic devil

MALCOM (CONTD)
Six months ago based on intel fed
to the Egyptians they picked him
up while he was there planning a
job to help the mallahs overthrow
the government

HOBBS
Yall put his evil ass away and now
you want us to bust him out

MALCOM

In that part of the world having
someone like Devlin in custody can
draw more heat than it deflects As
a result theyre willing to free
him in exchange for his agreement
to peddle his services elsewhere
We cannot let that happen That’s
where you come in

MEL
You guys topple governments Why
dont you do it yourselves

MALCOM
If the Egyptians were to find out
we were operating in-country
without their permission we could
lose one of our only allies in the
region

HOBBS
Plausible deniability man just
like I was saying

MALCOM
We don’t want him dead We want to
put him away - in the US

Hey I’m just concerned about the
welfare of a fellow peace officer
Single parenting’s no picnic

She slams the trunk closed

KAREN
I’m touched by your concern

VIC LEIBER
Have you told papa yet

KAREN

looking at five years mandatory
Theyll take the baby away Unless
of course you want to cooperate
and tell me where he is

KAREN
So you can put him back behind bars
for a crime he didn’t commit You
should be investigating the cops
who framed him

VIC LIEBER
And now he’s breaking people out of
prison for money

KAREN
It’s not just about the money

VIC LIEBER

I know I know Hes getting back
at the system that screwed him
Boo hoo hoo Cry me a river I
can just hear the speech I know

kicking a dog he’s gonna bite
back

VIC LIEBER
Sams in way over his head And
he’s gonna end up dead if you don’t
help me find him
(beat)
I’m on your side Karen

KAREN

to survive it’s Sam

VIC LIEBER
Not this time He and his team got
arrested by a ghost that I bet
didn’t read him his Miranda rights

of tourists in a strange land

The Trainmen focus on Mel and have a pointed exchange in
Arabic The “Brazilian Bombshell” interrupts with something
that ends in the word “Hippie” Placated the trainmen return
the passports and move on

MEL
What was that about

“BRAZILIAN BOMBSHELL”
Your pony-tail They thought you
were homosexual

DOMINIC
Nah he’s just a virgin

LIEBER
Dont do it Sam Ill drop you
right here

SAM
Go ahead kill me Three of my
family are already dead I don’t
care anymore

LIEBER
I‘m gonna get too much satisfaction
seeing you cuffed and chucked

SAM
What are you going to do Call your
bosses and say you got me but let
an international terrorist go

VIC LIEBER
Just be happy I didn’t kill you
myself back there

SAM
How many more are going to die if
Deviin isn’t caught

VIC LIEBER
You broke him out

SAM
And we can get him back

VIC LIEBER
There is no ‘we’ Sam This isn’t
Special Ops eight years ago

SAM
There’s always gonna be a ‘we’
Leiber Just like back there You

gave me the skills to do what I do

And we can bring him in

VIC LIEBER
Devlin is not my problem You are

SAM
Youre just going to let him get
away

Vic LIEBER
He’s probably half-way to Cuba by
now That’s where his training
camps are Thats where he stashes
his money Thats where his ten
year old daughter is

HOBBS
So call it in to headquarters and
get this bullet out of my ass

SAM
Yeah call it in to the Washington
office who will call the Miami
office wholl send it back to the
New York office wholl want to do
a search to make sure Devlin is
really a fugitive You know how
long that’s going to take

HOBBS
Longer than it takes to get this
bullet out of my ass

SAM

I used to look up to you
VIc LIEBER

And now you want me to be like you
SAM

You are like me

(beat)
Christ you made me

HOBBS
Jesus you guys sound like a
frickin’ married couple I need a
box of tissues for the road

SAM
One last extraction You and me on
the same team again

Leiber is wavering

SAM
The only way to stop me is to stick
that bullet in my brain

HOBBS
Or in your ass

SAM
I’m doing this with or without you

VIC LIEBER
Im the one with the gun

SAM
I‘m not going back to jail

We hold on Lieber for a long beat And then we
EXT CARIBBEAN A FISHING TRAWLER - NIGHT

A run-down fishing boat negotiates the waves in the middle of
a fairly rough sea Sam Hobbs and Lieber are standing in
the stern of the boat quietly watching as they pull up
alongside

A CUBAN FISHING TRAWLER

And there standing on the bow like a stubby nerdy Captain
Ahab with a tan is LEONARD LOWE (from Brushy)

LOWE
Samuel I’m glad youve finally
come for that vacation I offered
Welcome to Cuba home of every
exiled criminal in the world In
America were traitor’s kid Over
here we can be national heros

He helps Sam and Hobbs into his boat

LOWE
I’m sorry about your crew You guys
gave me something no one else could
give me my freedom
(beat)
The risks you guys took for me
(MORE )

LOWE (contd)
I feel like I owe everything I have
to them And I‘ll do whatever has
to be done to get the motherfuckers

that cut them down
He turns towards ALDO GARCIA a sharp-eyed dark-skinned MAN

LOWE
This is Aldo He did eight years in
Columbia for kidnapping

Aldo shakes hands with Sam and Hobbs Lowe motions to SANTOS
DOMINICA an older man with a slight lisp

LOWE
And this is Santos He was
Noriega’s right hand man in Panama

Lieber makes his way onto Lowe’s boat He walks over to Sam

VIC LIEBER
Were supposed to trust these guys

LOWE
With your life
(offering up his hand)
Leonard Lowe

Vic LIEBER
I know who you are

LOWE
And I know exactly who you are But
down here - you ain’‘t nothing
special You don’t mean shit

Lowe motions to 3 other CUBANS standing on his deck They
move quickly boarding the American fishing trawler

LOWE
Castros men are doing spot checks
A crew of 6 goes 6 come in
Besides they paid their way

On Sam’s face he looks at the ISLAND OF CUBA in the
distance eyes alight with hope

INT LEONARD LOWE‘S HOME BASEMENT - LATE DAY

A BIG HOME in one of the few wealthier areas of Cuba
transformed into a HI-TECH INTEL CENTER for the team

Right now the TEAM eyes a WALL OF PHOTOS of Devlin
(standing tall and alert wearing sunglasses and an army cap
which conceal his face -- but we can tell it’s him from the
SCARS half-hidden by his beard) We also see PHOTOS of
Malcom “BRAZILIAN BOMBSHELL” and “THE WATCHER”

LOWE
We used the GPS signal tracked
Devlin to a military base in the
Sierra Maestras

He leads them through his surveillance photos

LOWE
(indicating another photo)
Your man always seems to travel in
armored cars

A CONVOY OF SUBURBANS

rumble through the STREETS of HAVANA We PAN away from them
to find a rusting rattling VAN cruising behind the CONVOY
making good time in its wake

INT VAN SAME TIME

Aldo SNAPS pictures of the CONVOY as it slows in front of a
huge NIGHTCLUB in the heart of HAVANA

LOWE (0S)
Once they arrive in the city they
aim straight to this nightclub The
place is a zoo 1000 people inside
minimum The club caters to
tourists and a high class crowd
We have no pictures of the interior
because there’s metal detectors and
pat-downs as you go
in

THE NIGHTCLUB

PEOPLE -- TOURISTS and LOCALS - all dressed to the nines
are moving in and out in droves

INT LEONARDS HOME - NIGHT

LOWE
They said the guy was a notorious
pussy hound Must be making up for
lost time It’s unbelievable -- he
plans the deaths of hundreds by day
and gets laid by night

(MORE

LOWE (contd)
The club is 3 stories and Devlin
and his men have the 3rd floor to
themselves He doesn’t drink Just
meets with some Military guys and
women Leaves the club at about 2
AM

EXT CUBAN STREETS - NIGHT

Where Devlin’s convoy drives along approaching a GATE in the
near distance

INT LOWE’S HOUSE NIGHT

LOWE
-»We tracked him for 5 days Sam
2 nights he went to the Military
base And one night he took a
helicopter somewhere We dont know
where The only place he went to
every night was that club --
That’s everything we got His whole
routine

Sam studies the photos

SAM
The club’s no good Hes never
alone He’s right out in the open
and surrounded by armed guards
That means to get him wed have to
be out in the open too - and then
we become targets Itll turn into
a shoot-out

LIEBER
Are you telling me you can‘t
extract a guy out of a nightclub
Youve broken men out of the worst
prisons in the world but you can’t
bust a guy out of a disco

SAM
(dont you get it)
Theyll see us coming

Sam finally steps away from the PHOTOS pacing mind-racing
He catches sight of himself in the mirror And something
about it stops him He says again

SAM
Theyll see us coming

HOBBS
What‘s on your mind Sam

cuUT TO
THE MOON -- an omen in an angry sky PAN DOWN TO

EXT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Establishing The Havana streets usually sparsely populated
have found an exception here PEOPLE of all classes
including many MILITARY and politically connected MEN
obvious in their opulence swarm into this well-secured club

SECURITY OFFICERS at the door are armed with AK47s and
every patron is patted down before passing through a metal
detector as they enter Inside the doorway are more ARMED
SECURITY MEN keeping an eye on everyone

INT NIGHTCLUB NIGHT

Our first look inside the huge cavernous hall throbbing with
hypnotic house music The club is shadowy and dim lit by
brief STROBOSCOPIC flashes of light The dance floor is on
the lowest level in the center and each level as it goes
up is overhung by the level above like a series of circular
balconies Tables line the crowded upper levels -- except

THE THIRD LEVEL

High above the dance floor -- below a grid of lights The
third level’s stairways are guarded by ARMED MEN and it is
much less crowded -- set aside for VIPs and the very
beautiful women who move freely up and down the stairs

In the back corner of this shadowy smoky and loud area we
find 5 ARMED MEN gathered cordoning off several tables At
the tables are

Malcom “The Watcher” “Brazilian Bombshell” All the way in
the back corner is Devlin his back to us with his full
beard and hat pulled low smoking a Cuban cigar as several
WOMEN entertain him

We watch this scene for a beat waiting for something to
happen -- waiting for the extraction to begin when Malcom
looks up as a GUARD approaches from the stairs

GUARD
(in AFRIKAANS)
Somebody’s down in the club saying
they’re here to see Mr Devlin

And somehow from this we know the extraction has begun
) Malcom stands looking down into the club searching

MALCOM
(in AFRIKAANS)
Who

GUARD
(in AFRIKAANS)
Said his name was Sam Coburn

Malcom’s eyes narrow intrigued looking down at
THE SECOND LEVEL
And at the base of the staircase his eyes find

SAM - in plain sight staring right back at him with the wild
eyes of a madman -- exuding confidence -- and vengeance He’s
not in disguise he’s standing in the open as himself It
gives Malcom pause as well as us Malcom pulls his side arm
out and rocks the hammer back

MALCOM
Pat every inch of him down Then
send him up

a The Guard turns as we go to
SAM

Two guards patting him down and taking position next to him
as he climbs the stairs past more guards -- right toward
Malcom and Brazilian Bombshell’s table We don’t see anyone
else with him ‘What the hell is he up to’

Malcom stands firm smiling at Sam as he approaches but we
notice something and so does everyone else -- there’s a
crazed look in Sams eyes a lunatic thousand yard stare Sam
finally reaches him flanked by Guards A long beat

MALCOM
A lot of guts you have

Simply but with an air of madness

SAM
IT want Devlin He walks out With
me Now

MALCOM

- Really

And Sam leans close now -- the Guards around him tense up

SAM
I have a man down there If I don’t
walk out with Devlin in the next 3
minutes he’s going to detonate a
device that’s sitting right over
Devlin’s head It‘ll blow this
whole area to pieces and turn your
ass into applesauce No tricks this
time Very Simple No big escape

And there it is Sam’s plan It hangs there Devlin‘s finally
turned and watches this meeting take place now Sam goes on

SAM (cont‘d)

Ive got nothing to lose I’ma
desperate guy Because of me three
of my closest friends are dead And
Ill either end up in jail or die

(a beat)
Id rather die So go look See
that I’m telling the truth Devlin
walks out with me or we all die I
don’t think you have much of a
choice

Malcom exchanges a look with “Watcher” before walking back
toward Devlin Sam watches trying to see whats transpiring
in the dim stroboscopic light A long excruciating beat
until

Sam sees Malcom returning -- with another MAN who we can’t
see in the throbbing light -- yet

Sam focuses on “Watcher” who for some reason is now
smirking at him Sam turns back to Malcom and his
‘companion’ curious now As they draw near Sam suddenly
recognizes

LEONARD LOWE

Walking with Malcom Lowes eyes meet Sam’s for a second
then look away painfully Sam stands shocked puzzled

LOWE
Sorry Sam But I have to live down
here

SAM

Leonard Why are you here What did
you do What did you tell them

Leonard just lowers his head unable to look Sam in the eye

Malcom smirks eyeing the devastated Sam Malcom then reveals
a small hi-tech electronic DEVICE -- no bigger than a small
calculator And when Sam sees it his face congeals with
despair

MALCOM

He told us enough Sam It was a
nice piece of equipment and had
you come here by surprise I don’t
know what we would have done But
that’s not the way it turned out
You of all people should know
that you really can’t trust anyone

Sam takes a deep breath guts wrenched by this betrayal

SAM
You stupid son of a bitch Leonard
You killed us

LOWE
I had no choice Sam The Cubans
protect me I have a relationship
with the Military

Sam doesn’t even hear him He just shakes his head gravely
caught Leonard’s voice trails off as LOUD VOICES suddenly
reach them from the stairs They all turn to see

A CUBAN MILITARY POLICE CAPTAIN

Marching up the stairs followed by TWO MILITARY POLICEMEN
with their guns at the ready hats pulled low Some PEOPLE in
the club have noticed the commotion now and are watching

LOWE (cont’d)
Thats Captain Ruiz -- the one I
called in case I didn’t get here in
time He’s a good man

A GUARD turns to Malcom questioning

GUARD
(in AFRIKAANS)
Sir the Military Police --

Malcom nods expecting this and the Guard stands aside
allowing the Captain and his men to approach CAPTAIN RUIZ
nods toward Lowe as if they know one another as his men fan
out taking positions Sam has no choice but to stand and
await his arrest To Malcom

CAPTAIN
I apologize that we haven’‘t
arrested this man before he
bothered you but I assure you we
will take care of him

MALCOM
Good At least you won’t have to go
back to jail will you Coburn
You’ll get your wish

And the two Military Policemen move toward Sam as the Captain
reaches a hand out stepping toward Lowe --

CAPTAIN
Thanks for your assistance

And as the Captain leans into the flashing LIGHT we see his
FACE fully for the first time

It’s Aldo In disguise

Looking at Leonard All is not as it seems We see the other
‘POLICE’ now recognizing them as Santos and Lieber - also in
disguise And now we‘re getting it It’s all been a set-up to
get Sam’s team in close proximity to Devlin and his men with
Leonard Lowe in on the whole thing

In the dim light Aldo looks at Sam Sam nods An almost
imperceptible look Malcom sees this subtle interplay between
them but before anything really registers Also raises his
RADIO

ALDO
(into radio)
Now

WHOOSH The stroboscopic LIGHT in the club GOES OUT The
MUSIC STOPS Complete DARKNESS falls over the scene We can’t
see ANYTHING Then suddenly everything happens fast

POV NIGHT VISION - HOBBS

Hobbs has equipped himself with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES and is
handing another pair of NIGHT VISION GOGGLES to SAM Its
chaos as Devlin‘s guards blindly try to react fending off
blows from unseen assailants Sam heads for Devlin whos
unguarded now making a hasty retreat trying to get out of
there in the darkness stumbling as Sam catches him --
pounding the needle into his back as Devlin goes down --
reacting almost immediately to the drug

Malcom struggles with Aldo fighting well despite his
blindness - hitting Aldo in the head with the pistol he’s
managed to grab -- knocking Aldo’s night-vision goggles off
He puts the gun to Aldo’s throat shooting him point-blank --
blowing his trachea out the back of his neck sending him
into a quiet gurgling death

SAM (INTO RADIO)
Hobbs Now

Sam grabs Devlin who’s face down on the floor unconscious
Sam quickly swings him up toward the railing that overlooks
the club and looks up spotting

HOBBS

Descending like a spider from a VENT SHAFT in the CEILING --
as fast as if he were falling -- REPELLING down toward

SAM who throws Devlin up against the rail -- getting ready
to clip him onto Hobbs’s harness as soon as he arrives But
as Sam turns Devlin over he sees

DEVLINS FACE CLOSE UP And as Sam looks at him he
notices something One of the SCARS on his face is PEELING
OFF -- literally falling off Sam reaches up touching all
the scars All FAKE -- all coming off

Its not Devlin

It’s an imposter Sam is stunned - unable to react from sheer
shock for a moment Then finally -- he YELLS

SAM (contd)
Abort Abort NOW It’s not him

EXT CLUB

It’s absolute chaos A full-ass FIREFIGHT between Devlin’s
people and our TEAM The CROWD thats still pouring out of
the CLUB runs roughshod in every direction As the two sides
exchange GUNFIRE we see

THREE MEN emerging from the club TWO heavily armed the
third -- the BLONDE MAN we saw in some of the SURVEILLANCE
PHOTOS walking along as if he is immune to the GUNFIRE
making his way toward the Transnational’s middle Suburban

SAMS EYES eyes linger on the blonde man a curious look
crossing Sams face as he sees the way the men flank the
Blonde Man - how the TRANSNATIONALS cover him by firing more
fiercely Then just as the BLONDE MAN gets in a Suburban
THE TRANSNATIONALS start to withdraw in their 3 Suburbans
covering their retreat with heavy fire It dwindles as TIRES
SCREECH and they pull away -- breaking off from the pitched
battle It’s all over as soon as it began

Sams eyes stay focused on that BLONDE MAN in the middle
Suburban never leaving Just as the Suburban is about to
turn the corner the Blonde Man turns locking eyes with Sam
and we now see why Sam has been looking at him

The Blonde Man is Devlin

Sam shakes his head knowing how he was duped The Suburbans
disappear and the street settles just the SCREAMS of fallen
PEDESTRIANS and the sudden SOUNDS of SIRENS rises

SAM
Lets move

INT LOWE’S TRUCK - SAME TIME

Sam drives Liebers in the passenger seat Santos sits in
the back with the wounded Lowe Hobbs is in the truck bed

EXT STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC RISES a HYPNOTIC STACCATO RHYTHMIC BEAT blaring and
bleeding taking us all the way through our finale

EXT AVENUE NIGHT

As Devlin’s CARAVAN of SUBURBANS cruises along a wide avenue
getting out of town minimal traffic around them We see
Devlin’s silhouette -- the BLONDE MAN -- in the middle
Suburban We PULL AWAY from that caravan still keeping them
in view Were about 200 yards away moving toward a parallel
side street where we suddenly find

Lowes TRUCK on that street 200 yards away and parallel to
the avenue Devlins on Sam drives looking toward the

AVENUE which we can only see as they hit each intersection --
through the clear view of the perpendicular streets Every
time they reach an intersection Sam looks over searching

for and finding

DEVLINS CARAVAN OF SUBURBANS
Sam hits the gas keeping pace The staccato images of the

caravan get more regular as Lowe gets the exact speed down
pacing them 200 yards away but in sync as we see
lll

Hobbs places his eye to the high-powered SIGHT of his Heckler
and Koch sniper rifle and he focuses on the THIRD VAN in

Devlin’S CARAVAN

Hobbs tightens his finger on the trigger ready Waiting
Then BAM Hobbs SHOOTS We hear the CRACK of the rifle

then see

THE DRIVER

Of the third van in cross-hairs -- just for an instant And
then the target is gone from sight as Sam’s van races still
speeding along the side street

INT DEVLIN’S SUBURBAN - SAME TIME

As Devlin sits quietly in the Suburban following that lead
SUBURBAN Suddenly a SCREECH of TIRES Devlin looks in the
REARVIEW MIRROR he sees

THE THIRD VAN in his CARAVAN skidding out of CONTROL driver
slumped over the wheel That Suburban slews madly off the
highway and crashes -- WHAM -- into a dirt embankment

INT LOWES TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Hobbs waits patiently for the next intersection - sees the
opening - squeezes off another shot

DEVLIN’S CARAVAN

The lead Suburban veers out of control flipping over and
over bodies flying

INT DEVLIN’S SUBURBAN

BAM ONE of the MEN sitting in the back takes a shot to the
head Then BAM The other SOLDIER in the back takes a SHOT
right through his cheek Devlin turns to see

LOWE’S TRUCK

Emerging out of the clouds of SMOKE and FIRE that engulf the
street where that SUBURBAN has overturned

Sam has his foot to the gas Hobbs steadies his rifle
looking through the scope at Devlin’s vehicle as they slowly
close the distance on it

INT DEVLIN‘’S SUBURBAN

It’s just Devlin and his driver now -- Malcom Devlin finally
spots his enemy -- 50 yards behind
He reacts opening up with his SUBMACHINE GUN firing
blind Most of the shots go wild but some still hit

LOWE‘S TRUCK

Peppering it SHATTERING GLASS

INT DEVLINS SUBURBAN

Devlin stops firing long enough to see

Hobbs setting up his cross-hairs on the DRIVER of Devlin’s
SUBURBAN Malcom BAM He takes the shot And suddenly

Malcom falls over in the driver’s seat -- dead

SAM
Looks like I got my wish

Devlin frantically dives for the wheel - dropping his gun as
the Suburban starts to careen off the road

Devlin‘s completely alone now unprotected with no guards
SAM hits the gas closing the distance five yards behind
Devlin tries to RAISE his WEAPON and steer at the same time
He has Sam in his sights He FIRES blindly -- missing
Lieber returns fire - blowing off a chunk of Devlin’s
shoulder Sam holds steady almost parallel now

They’re on a straightaway now No end in sight Neither
slowing down both driving with reckless abandon Sam speeds
up jerking the wheel and SMASHING into Devlin’S SUBURBAN

Devlin covered in blood turns locking eyes with Sam
taking his eyes off the road and suddenly he lets go of the
wheel turning completely in his seat Both hands now steady
his weapon on Sam

He’s not steering any longer

VIC LIEBER
Watch out

Lieber FIRES - shooting off Devlin’s left ear Sam does the
only thing he can -- he RAMS Devlin’S VEHICLE one last time --
causing it to spin wildly out of CONTROL doing a 360
careening wildly -- right back into SAM’S CAR Sam tries to
avoid it but can’t --

SLAM The force of impact throws Sam‘s vehicle into a spin
Both cars slew madly across the street still churning high
speed when --

CRACK SAMS CAR hits the curb and VICIOUSLY FLIPS as
Deviin’S SUBURBAN SLAMS into a BUILDING with sickening
impact Hobbs is hurled out of the bed of the pick-up truck

Both cars finally settle in their fallen crumpled positions

Silence No movement until Devlin bloodied but alive crawls
out of his vehicle

SAM lies in the front seat of his van upside down pinned by
the wreckage unable to move Sam tries to struggle out of
the crushed heap turning to see

Devlin standing and walking -- barely He FIRES in Sam’s
direction - blinded by all the blood in his eyes

Sam looks for a weapon seeing a pistol in the back -- out of
his reach Sam looks back Devlin’s right outside the van
now looking down at him Sam stretches trying to get free
when

BAM Gunshots ring out

Sam flinches as if he were shot but instead -- Devlin FALLS
shot in the head and back

Sam stunned turns to see Lieber twisted upside down in the
crumpled truck holding a smoking gun And Hobbs halfway
across the street letting his sniper’s rifle drop
