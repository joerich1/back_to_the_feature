His gun half drawn --
Staring at the barrel of Jeff s gun pointed at him

FIRES three more in his chest with the other gun

Wheels around and BLOWS AWAY a THUG who has come through the door behind
him

Jeff leaps to his right as the SHOTGUN FIRES

He avoids the full impact of the BLAST --

Takes some PELLETS in his back

SMALL BAR

The BARTENDER pumps the shotgun for a second BLAST --
Jeff moves toward him CONTINUOUSLY FIRING both pistols
Every bullet rips into the Bartenders body

His second pellet blast FIRES uselessly into the ceiling

Starts for the door

Our sources say that hes living in Hong Kong

Rogers is reading the file
ROGERS

Hes charged with depriving a citizen of his civil
rights Youll pardon me but this seems a

rather

trivial offense

LEE

He deprived this citizen of his civil rights by
putting

seven bullets in his head and body

ROGERS

Im told there are hundreds of murders a day in
your

country Whats so special about this one to take
you

so far out of your jurisdiction
4692 DG WH 12

LEE

This particular citizen was a politician Corrupt
Mafia connected a drug trafficker but a politician
So the Bureau does not want to appear unenthusiastic
in the pursuit of his killer

ROGERS
Youll pardon my own lack of enthusiasm

LEE
We also believe he is a contract killer with at least
twenty-five notches on his gun

ROGERS
(perfunctory)
Not a bad number Youll find killers for hire are
rather common in Hong KongOf course well help
you in any way we can

LEE
Ill try not to be a burden

ROGERS
Please remember you have neither authority nor
jurisdiction here which means if you do find him
you will inform us and we will decide what action if
any is to be taken You are not to apprehend him in
any way yourself Do you understand me

LEE
Perfectly

ROGERS
And Ill have your gun

LEE
I dont carry it on social occasions

You will not carry a gun on any occasion in the
