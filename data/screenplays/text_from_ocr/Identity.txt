EXT DESERT HIGHWAY -- TWILIGHT -- FIVE MINUTES AGO

An aging TRANS AM roars past An ‘after market convertible
meaning someone took the roof off with a chain saw -

Its being driven by PARIS NEVADA Vegas call girl -- Late

for a lighter -- Purse nothing -- Glove box -- nothing --

As she remembers - The PICTURE FREEZES FRAME -

lights a line of BIRTHDAY CAKE CANDLES -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL
that the candles are in fact stuck on a FAT NAKED BUSINESSMAN
who is tied to the bed covered in whipped cream
PARIS
(singing)
For he’s a jolly good fellocow
Which nobody can deny

She tosses the LIGHTER in her suitcase -
SMASH BACK TO

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY -- TWILIGHT
Paris sees the bulging suitcase on the back seat -

PARIS

Without slowing down she reaches for the bag and starts for
the lock - Theres a ripping sound as the bag is torn open
by ‘the gale and clothes start flying everywhere -—

PARIS (CONTD) (cont’d)
Jesus shit

She finds the lighter lights her cigarette but it fizzles
out She looks upward as -- RAIN BEGINS TO COME DOWN ON HER
FROM THE DARK SKY ABOVE

PARIS (CONTD) (cont’d)
God dammit

She tosses the butt and flicks on her wipers and the radio
holding a Burpee Catalog over her head
jm 31102 6

We hear the same broadcast heard in George’s car
O) ‘The hour chimes - six oclock

As her Trans Am roars off clothes are distributed by the
gusting wind AND A SINGLE OBJECT lands on the wet road

the ground Alice stands over him holding an umbrella
looking skeptical

ALICE

ALICE

GEORGE
If the point is to save up so we
can put him -- put Timmy -- into
the right school -

ALICE
(sighs )
You want a juice

“ GEORGE
No thank you

A banging on the window and Alice looks up to see --

Timothy smiling at her his hand pressed to side glass
She presses her hand to the window over his and smiles

He takes his away And smiles
-- She takes hers away

He shuffles on his knees backward from the window
-- Alice takes a step back from the window smiles

ALICE IS HIT BY A BLACK CAR --
Shes hurtled through the air --

Timothy’s eyes are contorted with terror --
His mouth opens -- but no sound comes out --

George is sent tumbling -- and Alice lands beneath a road
sign her neck slashed open --

And the car a limousine screeches to a standstill --
George rolls over onto his front to see his wifes crumpled
body He runs to her still holding the jack handle -- The

only sound is Timothys strange voice-less crying - and
distant thunder

GEORGE (CONTD) (contd)
Alice Oh my God --

He turns back to the limousine -- Its motionless and quiet
George runs to it and starts pounding on the dark windows --

of LIGHTNING take snap-shots of twisted Joshua Trees -

And Maine crashes through -- still in his cuffs -- staggering
to keep his footing -- looking behind all the way --

The lights of the Motel becoming fainter --

The sodden ground tries to swallow his feet -- He loses a
shoe in the muck He pulls himself from the quagmire
climbs a rise and hurries over it -- As he careens down the

shelter - He re-doubles his efforts --

in his surroundings This diner hasn’t been used for years
Covered in dust He pulis a sheet from a table and uses it to
dry himself Then he notices -- Light seeping through large
bay windows Curious he moves closer -- wipes the fog --

And his face drops -- it is the motel courtyard --
HE IS BACK AT THE GOLDEN PALM MOTEL --

He steps back from the glass -- as a dark figure moves only
inches from him outside through the steamed glass -- Maine
keeps moving backward tripping over a chair -- his head
spins with disorientation --

The figure outside steps into the clear circle that Maine
wiped away Turns -- It is Ed His eyes meet Maine

Maine spin to flee - And crashes face to face with Rhodes --
Rhodes takes a swing at him and clips his head -- Maine runs
the opposite direction Ed enters -- and he and Rhodes corner
Maine -- their fists pumping on him

It is coming from the back side of the motel A dark figure

in the blackness She crouches lower and holds the two by
four in the air If it’s Rhodes he’s doubled back around
If it’s Ed he’s about to get his head knocked in

Suddenly Paris turns sensing someone behind her It is a
dark figure -- Ed He looks frightening His eyes are black

She runs from him just as --

RHODES STEPS INTO THE VENDING MACHINE AREA He looks about
Slow Deadly Ed watches him Then moves on after Paris

cuT TO
REAR OF MOTEL - NEAR LARRY’S TRAILER
Ed approaches Paris

PARIS
Please get away from me

ED
Im not going to hurt you

PARIS
Why the fuck should I believe you
Where the hell have you been
SUDDENLY RHODES ROUNDS THE CORNER FACING THEM --

There are four cascading waterfalls of runoff between them
and Rhodes Rhodes squints at them through the water -- BANG

Ed shoves Paris back --

AND A BULLET EXPLODES INTO ED’S SHOULDER He falis back

against the pool house He looks up into Paris’ eyes She is

terrified in the soft shadows

Ed chuckles through the pain

Ed looks at her rain running down his face

ED

through the first cascading run-off

RHODES

PARIS

Ed keeps moving -- only one veil of water remains between
them Rhodes fires -- BANG - and Ed takes another shot to
the body But he keeps moving--

moving through the last cascade as -- BANG BANG - He takes
two more shots to the body and lands on top of Rhodes -- and
they roll into the mud --

Rhodes comes close to the sparking live wire and tries to
evade the voltage rippling through a deep puddle as --

Ed manages to grip Rhodes’ gun --

Paris runs down from the pool house as --

Ed manages to point the gun to Rhodes’ chest -- and fire the
remaining shot -- BANG -- point blank into his heart

Rhodes fall back dead

Ed collapses to the ground under the eves Blood seeps from
his body He pants for air Paris runs up to him

PARIS (CONTD) (contd)
Oh God Tell me what to do

He manages to look at her --
But there is a hopeless shadow in his eyes

PARIS (CONTD) (contd)
Help me get you in the the truck
Well drive to the hospital
She tries to move him but Ed pulls away

PARIS (CONTD) (contd)
You need to go to the hospital

The weakest chuckle eminates from Ed
PARIS (CONTD) (cont’d)

ED
No

A murmur in the room —

DOCTOR

J Detective Please

Malcolm (as Ed) stares at them shocked by what he sees -

‘We see only fragments of them death after death The
locations of the murders don’t appear the same as those at
the Golden Palm and the victims are different too but the
methods and body positions are eerily familiar

Ed looks up at the Doctor

DOCTOR (CONTD) (cont’d)

When faced with intense trauma
Edward a childs mind can fracture --

creating ‘disasociated identities’
‘alters’ which possess no memory of
the pain and thus allow the child to
inhabit them free of it This is what
happened to Malcolm He developed a
condition commonly known as Multiple
Personality Syndrome

ED
Why are you telling me this

C) DOCTOR
vot (gently)
Because you Edward are one

of his personalities

For a moment Eds world stops He sits in silence trying to
make sense of what hes been told Then he chuckles

ED
What

The Doctor gives Ed -- A HAND MIRROR He numbly looks at his
own REFLECTION -- Only it’s NOT HIS REFLECTION

The reflection in the MIRROR is that of MALCOLM

The MIRROR is dropped on the table and THE CAMERA WHIP PANS

TO A SHOT OF MALCOLM - STUNNED - HE TRIES TO STAND - BUT
REALIZES HES STRAPPED TO THE CHAIR - HE PULLS AT THE STRAPS -
SHOCKED TERRIFIED - PANICKED

MALCOLM

He catches sight of his reflection in the window --

-- and again sees Malcolm

DOCTOR
Try to stay calm Edward

MALCOLM

WHAT IS GOING ON WHERE IS MY
FACE WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME

DOCTOR
Edward There’s a reason I am
doing this if youll let me

MALCOLM
WHY AM I TIED DOWN LET ME OUT

DOCTOR

MALCOLM
WHERE IS EVERYONE WHO ARE THESE
PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
MOTEL WHERE’S PARIS

DOCTOR
»The motel doesnt exist Edward
Except in the paradigm of Malcolms
childhood Nor do the people you
met there

DOCTOR (CONTD) (cont’d)
Youve been sharing a single mind
with ten others Edward You’ve
been living an episodic life

DOCTOR
You don’t live there Edward You
don’t live anywhere Malcolm is in
the middle of a medical treatment
One which forces co-consciousness
One which brings all his identities
including you together The motel
was a scenario Suggested to awaken
memories in Malcolm’s core I knew
there would be violence and with it
the number of identities would be
reduced

Malcolm (as Ed) becomes still

MALCOLM
-reduced

DOCTOR

Only one of the alters you’ve met
tonight committed these murders
four years ago Edward But in
nineteen hours Malcolm will be put
to death for their actions unless
I can convince that man -

(pointing to the judge)

- that they are gone

MALCOLM
So you’re killing us

If I don’t succeed you will all
surely die with Malcolm tomorrow
