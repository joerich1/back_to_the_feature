EXT OCEAN - DAY
SEPTEMBER 5 2014

DANNY-- 17 sensitive skater type-- sits on a surfboard
LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA as he cleans off the lens

A LOW WHISTLE grabs his attention and he quickly whips the
camera around-- to reveal TWO OTHER SURFERS now paddling
furiously toward a SET OF WAVES moving in--

DANNY
KENNY

He whips the camera back toward KENNY-- 17 with a thin
frame wearing GLASSES even as he treads water--

DANNY (CONTD)
HERE COMES ANOTHER SET

KENNY
ROLLING

FOOTAGE FROM KENNY’S CAMERA at water level as he bobs up and
down on the waves--

BACK TO FOOTAGE FROM DANNY’S CAMERA as he attaches it to a
SHOULDER MOUNT and paddles out into deeper water joining the
other TWO SURFERS

JAKE-- 17 athletic girl magnet and SNAGGLETOOTH-- 17
blonde afro with crazy looking eyes and messed up teeth
JAKE
THIS ONE’S MINE

ADDITIONAL CAMERAS ATTACHED TO JAKE’S SURFBOARD capture him
turning around and dropping down the face of the wave--

Jake WHOOPS with JOY as he cuts back and forth across the
wave passing just inches away from Kenny’s camera

DANNY
Kenny Let the wave roll over you
next time

KENNY
WHAT

DANNY
GET IT FROM UNDERWATER

WE CUT IN BETWEEN THE VARIOUS CAMERAS as Snaggletooth drops
in on the next wave-- giving Kenny an awesome underwater shot
as he passes by

And then it’s Danny’s turn--

DANNY (0S) (CONT’D)
Whoa

He paddles into deeper water as fast as he can-- a MONSTER
WAVE bearing down on him--

Danny flips his board around WHOOPING EXCITEDLY as the
DEAFENING WALL OF WATER RISES UP--

And then he’s dropping down the face He executes a flawless
bottom turn then PLUNGES his hand into the wall of water
slowing down just enough that the lip shoots out over his
head

HOLD ON the perfect shot from inside the wave

And then Danny’s flying out of it and off the backside as the
wave closes out He lands on his back giving us a view of
nothing but the beautiful sky above

DANNY (0S) (CONTD)
And that my friends is what’s
known in the business as the Wave
of the Fucking Day

CUT TO
EXT CAMPGROUND - DUSK

KENNY CONTINUES TO FILM as the four boys sit at a picnic
table chowing down on sandwiches and swilling BEER

DANNY
Quentin Tarrantino

JAKE
Guns No doubt that motherfucker’s
strapped I’ll bet you he’s got one
stashed in every room just in
case
(thinks for a second)
Zoe Saldana

DANNY
Good one

KENNY (0S)
I say “no guns”

JAKE
You don’t think Saldana’s packing
heat Columbiana Come on

SNAGGLETOOTH
Speaking of hatchet wounds

Snaggletooth nods toward a group of TEENAGE GIRLS walking
toward them

DANNY
You can’t say stuff like that bro
It’s disrespectful

JAKE
At least not on camera It makes us
look like degenerates

SNAGGLETOOTH
(to Kenny)
What are you still filming for
anyway Put that thing away

DANNY
He’s filming because the best
footage we got on our last trip
wasn’t from out on the water it
was from when you kept trying to
smash that bottle over your head
and it wouldn’t break

They all laugh at the memory--
JAKE
Classic

KENNY (0OS)
Shit knocked you out cold as I
recall

Snaggletooth eyes the bottle in his hand--

SNAGGLETOOTH
Perhaps it’s time for a re-match

MOLLY-- cute but mopey alterna-chick-- shakes her head as the
group of TEENAGE GIRLS finally arrives

MOLLY
Sorry were late My mom got all
freaky when she found out there
were gonna be guys here

SNAGGLETOOTH
You shouldve brought her Id
totally bang your moms

MOLLY
Thanks Snag I’1l be sure to pass
that on

Molly’s younger brother PETE-- 13 tiny-- peeks his head out
from behind the girls--

PETE
‘Sup

ALL THE GUYS IN UNISON
PETE

The greeting is obviously “a thing” and Pete smiles enjoying
the attention from the older kids

Molly gestures toward SARAH-- a toughsexy girl with patchily
dyed hair--

MOLLY
Guys This is my cousin Sarah from
Portland She’s gonna be living
with me and Petey for a while

SARAH
Hey

The boys stare at her immediately taken
MOLLY

Snaggletooth smiles giving her a perfect view of his
obscenely crooked teeth

those beers

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

while back It’s all like surf
videos and stuff right

DANNY

Kenny helps out a lot too He’s
like the main camera guy

Sarah turns the camera on Danny interview style--

SARAH (0S)
You guys got a lot of followers

DANNY
Yeah Kinda

He smiles trying to be casual but we can see he’s proud--

DANNY (CONTD)
The thing is most of the content
out there kinda sucks Even the
pros are always putting the camera
in the wrong spot

He gets excited as he talks-—-
DANNY (CONTD)

Like when some guy’s dropping a
cliff on a snowboard People
always shoot that in a wide where
you can see everything And that
looks cool but it doesn’t capture
how it actually feels when you’re
the one doing it

Sarah slowly ZOOMS IN on his face--

DANNY (CONTD)
When you’re coming up on something
like that something so big you
can’t even see the landing when
all you see are the tips of fifty
foot trees peaking up from the
other side

(shakes his head)
It’s a rush

SARAH (0S)
Sounds intense

Danny looks over at her Smiles

DANNY
You sound intense

Beat

SARAH (0S)

They both crack up
KA-BAM A BOTTLE ROCKET EXPLODES IN DANNY’S LAP

DANNY

Snaggletooth-- obviously the culprit-- busts up LAUGHING as
Danny and Sarah scramble to their feet--

DANNY (CONT’D)

SERIES OF SHOTS

FROM DANNY’S SHOULDER CAM-- as he chases Snaggletooth down
the beach FIRING a roman candle at him

(off his look)
It was on the news this morning

IE SCHOOL - MORNING

JAKE
I’m just saying don’t let
yourself get too emotionally
involved That’s all

DANNY

JAKE
A girl doesn’t just suddenly move
in with her cousin for no reason
Danny A girl moves in with her
cousin when there’s a bunch of foul
shit going on at home And girls
who have that kind of foul shit
going on at home they can be mad
fun for a while but they’re
always messed up in the head And
you don’t wanna get all tangled up
in that craziness

DANNY
Thirty seconds ago you were
interested in dating her yourself

JAKE
That’s different If I thought you
were just gonna bang her for a
while and not get too attached
then I wouldn’t even say anything
But I know you

the middle of the courtyard eating lunch

Snaggletooth faces camera holding a HUGE ORANGE PEPPER
between his fingers

DANNY
A million scovilles That means
it’s four hundred times hotter than
Tabasco sauce

Snaggletooth shrugs pops the pepper into his mouth--

MOLLY

The kids stare at Snaggletooth waiting for something to
happen as he chews the pepper but he simply shrugs

SNAGGLETOOTH

open mouth then chomps into a SECOND PEPPER

one after the other--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT

He bolts away from the table HEAVING into some nearby
bushes causing a group of GIRLS walking by to scatter--

Everyone LAUGHS even harder oblivious to the fact that the
PRINCIPAL has come on over the school’s PA system-- until a
passing TEACHER makes them quiet down forcing them to
listen

PRINCIPAL (0S)
--As you know these are serious
times The viral outbreak in Asia

governor that a few isolated cases

A frightened MURMUR goes through the courtyard Danny and his

in his eyes--

BERNARD

DANNY (0S)

something

The camera starts to lose Bernard as Danny panics moving
about uncertainly--

DANNY (OS) (CONT’D)

hospital

BERNARD
We can’t take her to the hospital
Even if she had it they wouldn’t
be able to do anything for her

DANNY (0S)

EXT DANNYS BACKYARD - DAY

Danny’s VO becomes DIRECT ADDRESS as we find him sitting in
his backyard covered in dirt

DANNY
This morning I went in to bring
them their coffee
He shakes his head fighting back tears--
DANNY (CONT’D)
-but they must have died during
the night

HOLD ON ONE FINAL SHOT of two FRESH GRAVES in the backyard

INT BAR - NIGHT

KENNY FILMS as Danny and his friends sit gathered in a booth
near the front of the bar

MOLLY
This whole town is falling apart
There’s a gun going off every five
minutes out there

Molly glances over at Pete who’s quietly sobbing in the next
booth over--

MOLLY (CONT’D)
What the hell are we supposed to
do

The kids all look at each other for a moment

DANNY
For a while now I’ve been thinking
about what my dad said

Everyone turns toward Danny

DANNY (CONTD)
About all of us heading up into the
woods and just hiding out until
whatever happens happens I
think it’s not a bad idea

SNAGGLETOOTH
Sweet We could like hunt and live
off the land and shit

MOLLY
It’s not funny Snag

SNAGGLETOOTH
I’m serious My pops and I used to
hunt up there all the time I know
those woods like the back of my
hand

JAKE
We’re not gonna go hide out in the
friggin woods

Off their looks--
JAKE (CONTD)

Weve got everything we need right
here Food shelter running water--

Outside somebody YELLS as an ENGINE REVS--
A SCREECH followed by a SMASH

JAKE (CONTD)
now what

The kids walk over to the windows of the bar and peek out--

A group of TEN or so TEENAGERS stand in the street gathered
around a CAR that has crashed into a telephone pole

Half of the group are JUMPING UP AND DOWN on the car’s roof
while the other half pull the teenage DRIVER and his
GIRLFRIEND out of the front--

DANNY
Shit

JAKE
Danny hold up Don’t go out there

But he’s already stepping out of the bar--

DANNY
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING LEAVE
THEM ALONE

JIMMY-- 17 obviously the leader of the gang-- suddenly
appears swinging a SHOTGUN into view holding it at waist
level His eyes have a dull hateful look to them--

JIMMY
We’re doing whatever the hell we
feel like doing

JAKE
Danny Get back inside

BAM Jake pulls Danny back into the bar as the gun GOES OFF--
SHATTERING A WINDOW--

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG Our guys duck down as GUNFIRE
erupts outside-- GLASS EXPLODING EVERYWHERE--

KENNY (0S)
HOLY CRAP

JAKE
Kill the lights

Molly turns them off plunging everything into darkness--

JAKE (CONT’D)
Everyone stay down

DANNY
We gotta do something

JAKE
Like what

Danny looks out through one of the shattered windows--

To see the DRIVER trying valiantly to protect his girlfriend--
The kids clear away as Jimmy approaches with his shotgun--

He CHAMBERS A ROUND and points it at the driver The boy

looks up at him a bewildered expression crossing his

bloodied face--

The WHOOPING and HOLLERING reaches a crescendo then--

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM This is no shotgun it’s
something MUCH BIGGER--

TOTAL CHAOS OUTSIDE-- The kids turn and SCATTER in all
directions disappearing into the night--

AS A LOW RUMBLING SOUND echoes down the street--

MOLLY (0S)
(hysterical)
what’s happening

A HUMVEES slowly rolls into view A SOLDIER in biohazard gear
mans a fifty caliber machine gun mounted on the back

The soldier appears to look directly into camera as the
humvee rumbles past though it’s impossible to tell for
certain because of the man’s GAS MASK

Our kids watch as the Humvee continue on disappearing from
view

JAKE
This whole place is about to
blow
Jake turns to Danny
JAKE (CONTD)
You were right We need to get out

of here

CUT TO
INT BAR - MORNING

KENNY FLIPS ON HIS CAMERA to reveal Danny going over the

previous night’s footage on his laptop

DANNY

I can’t believe you were able to

keep rolling through all this

KENNY (0S)
Are you kidding I was just

grateful to have something to do

Without that camera I probably
would’ve soiled myself

DANNY
(re the footage)
It’s friggin’ amazing

KENNY (0S)
What’s the feedback been like

DANNY

We haven’t got any At least not

yet
(off his look)

The power went out before I could

post it to the site We’ve got
batteries but no internet

EXT BAR - MORNING

DANNY AND KENNY FILM THE CARNAGE as the group of friends

stumble out of the bar

JAKE
Oh man

Snaggletooth-- nursing a hangover--

SNAGGLETOOTH
This street looks like I feel

Danny steps over a trail of BLOODY FOOTPRINTS as

he wanders

out into the middle of the street-- BROKEN GLASS lies

everywhere along with small pieces of DEBRIS--

MOLLY
Game over man We’re done The
whole human race

SARAH

KENNY (0S)
(interrupting)
Maybe not

Kenny ZOOMS IN on a FLYER plastered on a nearby wall--

KENNY (CONTD)
According to this we’re
evacuating

DANNY
What

Kenny rips off the flyer holding it up for him--

KENNY
It says they’ve finally got a
working vaccine We’re supposed to
go check in at the high school and
they’re gonna bus us out from
there

Jake jumps up in the air
JAKE
Yeah We’re outta here OUT
EXT STREET - DAY

Danny walks with Kenny Jake and Snaggletooth a little ways
behind Molly Pete and Sarah

Sarah says something to Molly They both look back at Danny
for a beat then start laughing

SNAGGLETOOTH
(re Sarah)
You totally lucked out with that
shorty bro

DANNY
She’s cool huh

SNAGGLETOOTH
She’s hot

JAKE
I don’t think he’s lucked out with
her at least not yet

SNAGGLETOOTH
Oh man Tell me you ain’t letting
that go to waste

JAKE
Danny’s a virgin

SNAGGLETOOTH
What

JAKE
I SAID DANNY’S A--

DANNY
(interrupting)
DUDE What the hell

Jake cracks up LAUGHING as Molly and Sarah look back--

MOLLY
What’re you guys doing back there

DANNY
(pissed)
Nothing

Sarah gives him a funny look but then shrugs it off and goes
back to her conversation

Danny shoots Jake a look--
DANNY (CONT’D)

You can be such a jerk sometimes
you know that

SNAGGLETOOTH
He’s right
(then looking at Sarah)
On the other hand what you’ve got
there is a ticking clock Danny
It’s not something you can hold off
forever

Off their looks Snaggletooth shrugs--
SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)

It’s like my old man used to say
if she smokes she fucks

EXT STREET - LATER

Danny and his friends are now walking with a much larger
group of KIDS

Kenny ZOOMS IN ON A SOLDIER in biohazard gear standing at the
side of the road clutching a machine gun--

JAKE
(nodding as they pass)
‘Sup

No reaction The soldier stands frozen like a statue face
hidden behind his rubber gas mask

DANNY (0S)
Ken-bo

Kenny swings his camera toward Danny--

KENNY (0S)
Yeah

Danny keeps his voice low as though not wanting anyone to
overhear--

DANNY
Does your phone work

KENNY (0S)
I don’t know I’ve been keeping it
off to save the battery

DANNY
Try it

Kenny pulls out his cell phone and turns it on

KENNY (0S)
No service

DANNY
Nobody’s phone is working

KENNY (0S)
Maybe the networks are down or
something

DANNY
All of them

KENNY (0S)
Why not Everything else is
crapping out
(then)
Why You think it means something

DANNY
I don’t know Maybe

KENNY (0S)
Like what

For a second Danny looks as though he’s about to say
something but then he just shrugs

DANNY

I don’t know
EXT SCHOOL - DAY
A RAZOR WIRE FENCE surrounds the perimeter of the school and
SOLDIERS in biohazard suits mill about directing the
HUNDREDS of KIDS who stand in line waiting to pass through
two giant METAL DETECTORS which have been set up near the
entrance to the school

Our guys fall into line behind the other kids

Danny looks over at a nearby soldier something suddenly
catching his eye--

DANNY
Contractors

KENNY (0S)
What

Danny nods in the soldier’s direction
DANNY
These soldiers they’re not
National Guard anymore They’re
contractors Mercenaries

Jake turns back joining the conversation--

JAKE
So The government hires those guys
all the time

DANNY
Yeah To go fight wars

Danny looks around

DANNY (CONTD)
This is all wrong guys

SNAGGLETOOTH
What are you talking about

Danny lowers his voice as another soldier walks

DANNY
Yesterday the electricity was
working today it’s off
Yesterday all of our phones
worked today they don’t

SNAGGLETOOTH
So

DANNY
(thinking out loud)
They don’t want any information to

get out because they don’t want
anyone to know what they’re
doing

(then)

This is no evacuation
Jake laughs

JAKE
You are so paranoid bro You sound
just like your dad

KENNY (0S)
You mean his dad the Rhodes
Scholar

passed

JAKE
Yeah The one who thought 911 was
an inside job

DANNY
All I know is I see a lot of kids
going in through that fence but I
don’t see any of them coming back
out

JAKE
That’s because they’re in the gym
waiting to be bussed out

DANNY
In what I don’t see any buses

They look toward the school-- it’s true there aren’t any
buses--

JAKE
Okay Maybe they’re behind the
school

DANNY

In the soccer field

JAKE
So maybe they’re not here yet How
the heck am I supposed to know

DANNY
Were talking about what A couple
thousand kids What’s that worth
What’s that worth when civilization
itself hangs in the balance

MOLLY
That’s being a little over
dramatic don’t you think

KENNY (0S)
No He’s right

They all turn toward Kenny--

KENNY (0S) (CONTD)
Think about it Kids can’t keep a
power station running kids can’t
keep the water on We don’t know
how to grow crops or raise
livestock If this thing spreads
it’s the end and they know it

MOLLY
You guys are freaking Petey out

PETE
I’m okay

But he doesn’t look it Jake turns to Danny

JAKE
Dude We’re not even sick

DANNY
We could still be carriers

JAKE
We could also not be carriers

DANNY
Maybe that’s not a chance they’re
willing to take

SNAGGLETOOTH
You’re nuts bro

PETE
Maybe but what if he’s right

A beat of silence as the kids look at each other unsure what
to do

SARAH
So let’s check it out
MOLLY
‘Scuse me Check it out how
SARAH
Go back there and see what’s going
on
MOLLY

Are you insane We could get shot
I’m not going anywhere And neither
is Petey

Molly puts a protective arm around Pete

SARAH
Fine You stay put But the only
way we’re really gonna know what’s
going on is to go take a look for
ourselves

Danny hands his backpack full of camera gear to Jake

DANNY
Here Hold this
(then to Kenny)
You’re coming with us

EXT SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES SHOULD FEEL LIKE ONE CONTINUOUS TAKE
FROM KENNY’S CAMERA

Kenny follows Danny and Sarah as they creep through some
TREES near the school

Ahead of them a SOLDIER walks along the RAZOR WIRE FENCE
scanning the area for a moment before disappearing around a
corner off to their right

SARAH
Now

The three of them hurry over to the fence--

Sarah grabs Danny’s jacket as they get there-- quickly laying
it down over the razor wire and climbing over--

Kenny tosses her the camera-- EVERYTHING BLURRING WILDLY-- as
he and Danny follow her over--

Kenny takes back the camera as Danny grabs his jacket--

The three of them continue on creeping along the left side
of the school passing darkened classrooms--

As they reach the end of the building Sarah suddenly halts--
they can see SOLDIERS just around the corner through the
classroom windows--

They quickly backtrack away from the corner classroom with
Kenny constantly looking back (PANNING CAMERA) to make sure
they’re not followed--

DANNY
What do we do They’re all over the
place

Sarah-- stopping again as she looks up--

SARAH
If we could just get up on the
roof

DANNY

There’s no way

Her eyes settle on a nearby classroom window She turns to
Danny-—

SARAH
Gimme your jacket again

He hands it over--

DANNY
Why

Sarah quickly wraps it around her fist then PUNCHES through
the window SHATTERING it--

DANNY (CONT’D)
Sarah

She dives in through the broken window followed by Danny and
Kenny--

INSIDE THE SCHOOL

Our guys quickly scramble away from the window brushing off
broken glass--

DANNY (CONTD)
Are you crazy Like they’re not
gonna notice a broken window

SARAH
It got us in didn’t it

Sarah grabs something off the floor passing it to Danny--

SARAH (CONTD)
You dropped something

It’s the HANDGUN Bernard gave him Danny quickly stuffs the
gun down the back of his pants as they head out of the
classroom--

KENNY (0OS)
I can’t believe you brought that
thing with you Have you ever even
shot a gun

Before he can answer--

SARAH
SHHHH

They quickly draw back just outside the classroom as they
hear a RADIO BURST from outside the broken window--

SOLDIER (0S)
Knight Six to Knight One We have a
breach on the northwest side of the
building

Sarah motions to Danny and Kenny-- and then they’re off

again sprinting down the darkened hallway passing under a
“WELCOME BACK” banner hung haphazardly from the ceiling--
Stopping as a DOOR OPENS just ahead of them up on the right--
Sarah-- quickly pulling Danny and Kenny back--

KENNY’S CAMERA-- catching just a glimpse of TWO SOLDIERS
entering the hallway-- as our guys disappear into a darkened

classroom--

Our guys sit in total silence for a beat-- as the soldiers
pass by the classroom--

And then we’re on the move again--

We see the soldiers down at the end of the hallway-- their
backs to us-- as our kids slip out of the classroom and round
the corner stepping out into a--

COURTYARD

Danny-- already moving toward two TABLES at the far end--

DANNY
Use the tables to get on the roof

They quickly scamper up the tables and out onto the--
ROOFTOP

Our guys quickly duck down-- as they catch sight of SOLDIERS
of to the side of the building--

SARAH
Stay low Come on

They set off-- crouching as they move across the roof toward
the back of the school passing a LOUDSPEAKER just as it
CRACKLES to life--

LOUDSPEAKER
Group C thirteen report to
decontamination C thirteen

Danny and Sarah get to the other side first They peer out
over the roof-- their mouths dropping open--

DANNY
Jesus

Kenny slowly creeps over to the ledge and looks out
REVEALING

SOLDIERS dumping BODIES into a LARGE PIT which has been dug
out of the middle of the soccer field

LOUDSPEAKER (0S)
Group C fourteen C fourteen report
to decontamination

Sarah stares down at the pit full of bodies her mind
someplace very far away

SARAH
We’ve gotta get out of here

DANNY
Not so fast
(turning to Kenny)
Did you get all of this

KENNY (0S)
Yeah

DANNY
Are you sure

KENNY (0S)
Jesus Danny of course I’m--

THWAP-THWAP-THWAP SILENCED ROUNDS SUDDENLY RIP INTO THE ROOF
all around them--

DANNY
Holy crap

SOLDIERS-- coming up onto the roof from the far end of the
building their rifles muzzled with SILENCERS--

SARAH
RUN

They set off sprinting as fast as they can CAMERA SWINGING
WILDLY as they go--

MORE TWHAPING SOUNDS AS BULLETS WHIZ THROUGH THE AIR--

MORE SOLDIERS coming up from the courtyard--

SARAH
OVER THE FENCE IT’S OUR ONLY
CHANCE

They charge toward the end of the building and LEAP OFF--
sailing over the razor wire--

Hitting the ground HARD--
THE CAMERA BURSTS WITH STATIC for a moment--
And then they’re up and running again--

Sprinting through the wooded area running blindly as bushes
slap them in the face--

Bursting back out into the CROWD OF KIDS gathered at the--
FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

OUR SINGLE SHOT CONTINUES-- as our guys push their way into
the mass of bodies heading toward their friends-—-

KENNY LOOKSPANS BACK-- to reveal FOUR SOLDIERS stepping out
of the woods behind them scanning the sea of faces-—-

Danny-- YELLING to be heard over the crowd as he finally
reaches Jake and the others--

DANNY
GUYS GUYS

Everyone looks at Danny-- his expression instantly telling
them everything they need to know--

JAKE
Oh shit

Molly looks around panicked--

MOLLY
Where’s Petey

SNAGGLETOOTH
He was just here

They scan the crowd--

MOLLY
PETE

SARAH
They saw us They know that we
know

JAKE
We gotta get out of here

DANNY
What about all these people We’ve
gotta warn ‘em

SARAH
It’s too late

Off her look KENNY LOOKSPANS BACK-- to see the SOLDIERS
pointing in their direction--

KENNY (0S)
Oh shit

SARAH
Danny gimme the gun

JAKE
What gun

Molly continues frantically searching the sea of faces--

MOLLY
PETE

KENNY PANS BACK TO THE SOLDIERS-- one of them has entered the
crowd heading for our guys--

SARAH (0S)
Gimme the gun

Danny shakes his head

DANNY
We don’t need it

SARAH
Just give it to me

MOLLY
WHERES PETEY

Danny turns away from the approaching soldier-- only to see
TWO MORE SOLDIERS coming towards them from the other side--

DANNY
FUCK

KENNY (0S)
-e-what do we do

Danny looks out at the crowd for a moment then raises his
hands to his mouth and YELLS

DANNY
RUN EVERYBODY RUN

A few of the kids in their vicinity turn and look blankly at
Danny clueless as to why he’s freaking out--

DANNY (CONTD)
RUN FOR YOUR FUCKING LIVES IT’S A
TRAP

WHIP PAN BACK-- to see one of the approaching soldiers
raising his machine gun--

BACK TO SARAH-- as she sees it too-- and something inside her
SNAPS She lunges-- grabbing the handgun from the back of
Danny’s pants and whipping it up toward the soldier--

BANG

The guy goes down--

For an eerie moment the crowd suddenly goes dead quiet
and then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE--

TOTAL CHAOS-- as AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ERUPTS--

EVERYONE SCREAMING as the entire crowd suddenly tries to run
in all directions at once--

SARAH
This way

CAMERA SHAKES WILDLY as our guys charge through the crowd--

Most of what we see is just a BLUR but we know its bad from
the SOUNDS of the GUNFIRE and people SCREAMING--

QUICK GLIMPSES-- of PEOPLE on the ground STILL MOVING as
they’re TRAMPLED--

FLASHES of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from the edge of the crowd--

MOLLY (0S)
Danny Help

Danny whirls around to see Molly slipping under the crowd
while other kids try to scramble over her--

He grabs her hand and pulls helping her to her feet--

Sarah stops as they near the edge of the crowd--

MORE MUZZLE FLASHES-- There are soldiers FIRING on this side
too--

JAKE
We’re surrounded

Sarah ducks down as BULLETS WHIZ past her head cutting short
a SCREAM coming from somewhere behind them--

MOLLY
Where’s Pete

Sarah suddenly charges forward again--

DANNY
Sarah

She raises Danny’s handgun FIRING RAPIDLY as she breaks free
of the other kids--

BANG BANG BANG ONE OF THE SOLDIERS GOES DOWN--

Sarah darts over to him quickly grabbing his MACHINE GUN--
She whips back the slide OPENING FIRE on the OTHER SOLDIERS--
BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM

Bullets rip through biohazard suits--

THREE SOLDIERS GO DOWN before they even have time to register
what’s happening--

Seeing an out the CROWD OF KIDS suddenly charges forward--
getting in between our guys and the other soldiers--

SARAH
COME ON

She grabs a handgun from the soldier at her feet tossing it
to Jake--

SARAH (CONTD)
LET’S GO

Our guys turn and run from the school joining a LARGE CROWD
of SCREAMING KIDS as they spill out onto the--

STREET

OUR SINGLE SHOT CONTINUES-- THE CAMERA SWINGING WILDLY as our
guys haul ass--

SCREECH

WHIP PAN BACK-- to reveal a HUMVEE rounding a corner behind
them--
BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The 50 CALIBER GUN is DEAFENING--—
More SCREAMING and CHAOS--
GLASS EXPLODING from the windows of parked cars--

JAKE
DOWN HERE

He darts down a narrow walkway between two buildings-- The
others piling after him--

WALKWAY
BAM BAM

WHIP PAN BACK-- to see FOUR SOLDIERS on foot coming after
them--

Just as our guys round a corner--

Sarah drops back RETURNING FIRE around the corner as the
others sprint on ahead of her--

DANNY
(turning back)
Sarah

Sarah shakes her head as she SLAPS a fresh clip into her
machine gun and CHAMBERS a round

SARAH
Stay with the others

Danny hesitates

SARAH (CONTD)
GO IM RIGHT BEHIND YOU

They continue on with Sarah FIRING BACK as the SOLDIERS
finally burst into view--

HER ROUNDS driving them back around the corner--
Our guys burst out of the walkway to find themselves in a--
PARKING LOT

JAKE
Over there Behind the cars

They follow Jake toward a handful of PARKED CARS in the
middle of the lot--

Danny-- hesitating--

DANNY
WHERES SARAH

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The soldiers burst into view behind them--
SPRAYING the parking lot with GUNFIRE--

ANOTHER BURST OF STATIC ON THE SCREEN as Kenny dives to the
ground behind a car--

The STATIC CLEARS again-- and we realize we are looking out
from under the car-- just in time to see MOLLY FALL to the
ground clutching her stomach--

SNAGGLETOOTH (0S)
MOLLY

THE CAMERA WHIPS UP AGAIN as Kenny runs over to her--

Snaggletooth is already there kneeling over her covering
her wound with his hand--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
Shit

MOLLY
(dazed)
Where’s Petey

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM
THE CAMERA WHIPS UP-- and we see the SOLDIERS turning back
the way they came-- as SARAH OPENS FIRE on them from behind a
DUMPSTER-—
TWO OF THEM GO DOWN--

The others RETURN FIRE-- forcing Sarah back into cover behind
a garbage dumpster--

The remaining soldiers split up one going after Sarah the
other heading right toward us-- BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM

KENNY DUCKS DOWN again as BULLETS whiz by all around--

Snaggletooth stares down at Molly as the battle rages behind
them

MOLLY (CONTD)
I’ve gotta find Petey I promised
my mom that I’d look after him

SNAGGLETOOTH
Well find him Mol I swear
alright
Molly nods
MOLLY

I don’t wanna die Snag

Snaggletooth puts his hands on her chest covering her wound
as her BREATHING BECOMES IRREGULAR--

MOLLY (CONTD)
I don’t wanna die

He looks down at her for a beat unsure what to say

SNAGGLETOOTH
Mol You remember when you
totally flipped out on Suzie
Peterson and all those
cheerleaders in the woods back
behind school

MOLLY
How do you know about that

SNAGGLETOOTH
Because I was there I was sneaking
out of shop class and I heard
you guys fighting

MOLLY
Shit

SNAGGLETOOTH
I don’t know what they said about
me that got you so pissed off

Molly somehow manages a faint smile

MOLLY
You don’t wanna know

SNAGGLETOOTH
The point is you didn’t know I was
there You didn’t have to stick up
for me like that But you did
because deep down you’re a fucking
scrapper

(MORE)

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
Even if you don’t know it And you
know what scrappers do They fight
So fucking fight with me alright
Fight with me Right now
Molly nods her head
SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
You’re gonna be alright You got
me
Molly nods again
SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
Cmon Mol Say it Say it with me
You’re gonna be alright

MOLLY
I’m gonna be alright

Snaggletooth nods his eyes welling up He grabs onto her
hand clasping it in his own holding it over her wound

SNAGGLETOOTH
Yeah you are

MOLLY
I’m gonna be alright

Molly’s breathing becomes SHORT and FAST for a moment before
finally stopping cold

SNAGGLETOOTH
Molly

But she’s gone
Snaggletooth stares down at her lifeless body

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM GLASS EXPLODES out of the car above
their heads--

THE CAMERA WHIPS TO THE SIDE-- just as one of the SOLDIERS
appears in front of them RAISING HIS GUN--

BAM THE SOLDIER CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND

As he falls away we see SARAH standing behind him She
FREEZES as she catches sight of Molly lying on the ground--

SARAH
MOLLY

She runs forward--

Danny hurrying out to intercept her--

DANNY
Sarah

She pushes him away kneeling down over her cousin--

SARAH
Molly Goddamnit Molly

A wave of emotion crosses Sarah’s face At first her eyes
well up and she looks like she’s going to lose it
completely but then she somehow fights it back down a
look of grim determination slowly taking its place

She turns to the others

SARAH (CONTD)
Help me grab their guns

OUR SINGLE SHOT FINALLY ENDS

CUT TO

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY

Several rusty decommissioned boxcars sit on the tracks
which lie in an industrial part of town

INT BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

Our guys sit in a semi-circle in one of the boxcars passing
a water bottle back and forth Nobody says anything for
several seconds until finally Jake speaks breaking the
silence

JAKE
She was the first girl I ever
kissed

The others look at him for a moment considering this

DANNY
Yeah right

JAKE
It’s true I was new in town I
didn’t know anyone To be honest
I didn’t think girls would even be
into me
DANNY
Dude The minute you got here you
were instantly the most popular guy
in our whole school

JAKE
It was fifth grade Danny I didn’t
know any better

Jake shakes his head

Silence

JAKE (CONTD)
Damnit She was so fucking cool
Even back then

SNAGGLETOOTH
(quiet)
I don’t understand how she can
just be gone you know

Snaggletooth shakes his head

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
How can the girl who taught me how
to play guitar The one person
who went to every single show that
my band ever played even though we
sucked How can she be gone

Nobody has an answer for that one

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
It just doesn’t seem possible

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY

The kids sit in a small patch of shade behind the boxcars

eating some kind of soup that Kenny has simmering over a

camping stove

Sarah inspects their machine guns counting the ammo

Danny stands a few feet away watching the street from the
edge of a boxcar

JAKE
This soup is seriously grubbing
bro

KENNY
You think so I kinda just threw it
together

DANNY
Shhh

ENGINE SOUNDS--

We catch a quick glimpse of a HUMVEE approaching as our guys
duck down taking cover--

They sit in total silence for a long beat as the Humvee
RUMBLES by without stopping

When it’s gone Sarah turns to the group

SARAH
We’ve gotta get out of here

DANNY
We could still head up into the
woods

SARAH
Were way past hiding out in the
fucking woods Danny This whole
place just became a war zone We
need to get out

DANNY
We can’t just break the
quarantine

SARAH
Why not It beats dying

DANNY
What if we’re contagious

JAKE
I don’t know about you bro but I
ain’t sick

DANNY
You know that doesn’t matter
Technically we could still be
carriers otherwise they wouldn’t
be trying to kill us

JAKE
Yeah well technically I don’t
give a crap I’m with Ripley
here

(MORE)
JAKE (CONTD)
(nodding at Sarah)
I say we get the hell out even if
we are infected

DANNY
What’s the point If we’re infected
then we’1ll all be dead within a
year or two anyway

Jake looks at Kenny

JAKE
Is that how it works

KENNY (0OS)
Why are you asking me

JAKE
Because you’re smart Kenny

Beat

KENNY (0S)
I don’t know

SNAGGLETOOTH
One year two years it doesn’t
matter Anything’s better than
nothing

Jake and Sarah nod in agreement

DANNY
You guys are unbelievable We can’t
risk infecting the rest of the
world That’s insane

SARAH
No Insane would be sitting here
waiting for them to come and kill
us

JAKE
The decision’s been made bro

DANNY
You know what Jake Who the fuck
are you to be telling me the
decision’s been made You think
that just ‘cause you’re the captain
of the basketball team you’re
automatically our leader or
something Fuck you

JAKE
What do you wanna do Danny Vote
Everyone in favor of not getting
your ass killed raise your fucking
hand

Jake Sarah and Snaggletooth immediately raise their hands
Danny looks over at Kenny (CAMERA) for support--

KENNY (0S)
I’m just not sure we have a choice
DANNY
Of course we do There’s always a
choice
JAKE

Okay so what is it
Danny doesn’t have an answer for that one
JAKE (CONTD)
Exactly
EXT LOADING DOCK - DUSK

Sarah sits away from the railroad tracks watching the sunset
from the loading dock of some industrial building

FOOTAGE CHANGES FROM KENNY’S CAMERA TO ONE MOUNTED ON DANNYS
SHOULDER-- as he walks up behind her

DANNY (0OS)
Hey

She looks up at him

SARAH
Hey

He sits down digging a mini-cam out of his pack

DANNY (0S)
I’m putting one of these on
everyone

He mounts the cam onto her shoulder

DANNY (0S) (CONTD)
The way I see it the one good
thing about breaking quarantine is
that it means we can get the word
out

WE SWITCH VIEWS AS HE FLIPS ON HER CAMERA-- peering into the
lens as he adjusts it

Beat

DANNY (CONTD)
If the rest of the world sees
what’s happening with their own
eyes someone will have to step in
to stop it

SARAH
(unconvinced)
Maybe

SARAH (CONT’D)
You really think we’re wrong for
trying to escape

DANNY
All I know for sure is that if
youre going then I am too

SARAH
I don’t need you to protect me
Danny

DANNY
No I got that If anything I’m

guessing it’1l probably be the
other way around You know if
youre cool with that

Sarah smiles

DANNY (CONTD)
I’m sorry I doubted you back at the
school I should’ve just given you
the gun

SARAH
Don’t worry about it

DANNY
I didn’t know that you were Special
Ops or whatever

Sarah smiles again Danny looks at her waiting for an
explanation

SARAH
My dad’s one of those survivalist
kooks Ex Green Beret He’s got
this cabin out in the woods
(MORE)

SARAH (CONTD)
He used to take me up there on the
weekends to train for the end of
the world
(beat)
I guess now it’s here

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
NOTE KENNY CONTINUES TO FILM WITH THE MAIN CAMERA BUT OUR

KIDS ALSO NOW HAVE MINI-CAMS ON THEIR SHOULDERS ALLOWING US
TO CUT BACK AND FORTH WHEN CONVENIENT

GUNSHOTS ring out in the distance as the kids slowly make
their way through the darkened alleyway carrying machine
guns

Danny and Sarah lag a little behind Jake and Snaggletooth
fiddling with Danny’s revolver

SARAH
No You’ve gotta pull back on the
release first

DANNY
The what

Sarah reaches over pointing at a small lever on the side of
the gun Danny pulls it back

SARAH
Now push on the cylinder

Danny pops the cylinder out of the side of the revolver
DANNY
(getting it)
Ah

Danny stares down at the spent casings sitting in the
cylinder

DANNY (CONT’D)
Wait there’s still bullets in
there

SARAH
Those are just the casings

He looks at her confused

SARAH (CONTD)
Dude

Sarah takes the gun from him emptying the casings into her
hand

SARAH (CONTD)
See Empty

DANNY
I’m totally gonna shoot myself in
the foot or something aren’t I

SARAH
Probably

Ahead of them--
JAKE
(quiet)
Everybody down

Our kids take cover-- as a HUMVEE suddenly appears at the end
of the alley sweeping the area with its SPOTLIGHT--

And then continuing on

As the Humvee disappears our guys quietly make their way to
the edge of the street and peek out

SOLDIERS patrol both sides of the street which is lit by
INDUSTRIAL WORK LIGHTS and borders a LARGE WOODED PARK on
the other side

Our kids crouch down behind a garbage dumpster as one of the
PATROLS nears their location

They stay silent for a moment as the patrol passes then--
SARAH
(quiet)
Okay Now
They quickly dart out of hiding crossing the street--

Quickly ducking down again as they enter the TREES at the
edge of the park--

Just as ANOTHER SOLDIER appears on the street right behind
them--

EXT PARK -— CONTINUOUS
Our kids sit perfectly still as the SOLDIER walks past

SNAP A branch suddenly breaks under someone’s foot

The soldier stops turning toward the park

He flicks on a FLASHLIGHT attached to his machine gun
sweeping it through the trees

Our kids sit in silence waiting

Sarah slowly lines up a shot as the soldier continues
sweeping the area with his light

But after a moment the soldier seems to decide it’s a dead
end He flicks off his light and walks away letting out a
MUFFLED COUGH as he goes

The kids all breathe a collective sigh of relief as the
soldier disappears from view

DANNY
Did you guys hear that He coughed

KENNY
It might not mean anything

SARAH
I’1l1 tell you what If they do get
sick we might just have a chance

JAKE
Guys

They turn toward Jake who’s moved on ahead a little He
motions for them to join him--

DANNY
What is it

JAKE
(freaked out)
They’ve got a bunch of kids

The others creep over to his position and take a look for
themselves

KENNY ZOOMS IN WITH HIS HANDHELD--

TWO SOLDIERS stand in a nearby CLEARING just downhill from
them watching over a DOZEN or SO KIDS The kids all sit on
their knees with their hands tied behind their backs

INDUSTRIAL WORK LIGHTS illuminate the clearing and we see A
SECOND GROUP OF SOLDIERS at the far end standing near a
HUMVEE that sits parked on an ACCESS ROAD

As Kenny FOCUSES IN on the kids being held prisoner we
realize that one of them is PETE Molly’s younger brother

KENNY (0S)
Jesus

BACK WITH OUR GUYS as they look at each other unsure what
to do--

SNAGGLETOOTH
Theyve got Pete

SARAH
They’ve also got a fifty caliber
machine gun mounted on the back of
that Humvee
(shakes her head)
There’s nothing we can do for him

JAKE
She’s got a point bro

SNAGGLETOOTH
He’s one of us

DANNY
Snag’s right We can’t just leave
him there

The SOUND OF ENGINE NOISE draws their attention back to the
clearing-- as a SCHOOL BUS appears at the far end of the
access road

As our guys watch the bus pulls up to a stop across from
Pete and the other prisoners

Snaggletooth turns back to the group
SNAGGLETOOTH
If he gets on that bus we’re never
gonna see him again
He flips off the safety on his rifle
SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
Fuck it I’m going in You guys do
what you have to

Snaggletooth takes one last look at his friends

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONT’D)
Peace

JAKE
Snag

But it’s too late-- Snaggletooth darts off making his way
down the hill through the trees toward Pete and the other
prisoners--

SARAH
Shit

DANNY
What

Sarah points-- and we see MORE SOLDIERS entering the clearing
from off to the side dragging a couple of TEENAGERS out of
the woods headed toward the main group--

SARAH
There’s no way he’s gonna make it

DANNY
Weve gotta do something

SARAH
We can’t It’s suicide He knew
that going in

JAKE
(agreeing)
There’s too many of them

DANNY
It’s SNAG

SARAH
I’m not throwing my life away for
anyone

Danny looks at them for a beat then takes a deep breath and
darts off into the woods after Snaggletooth--

SARAH (CONT’D)
Danny

Sarah watches him go for a second then shakes her head--

SARAH (CONTD)
Shit

She bolts after him

KENNY FOLLOWS BEHIND HER WITH HIS FOOTAGE CREATING A MASTER
SHOT FOR THE SCENE

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH

Arriving at the edge of the clearing just as the bus doors
swing open--

The SOLDIERS guarding the kids motion for them to get on--
WITH DANNY

Ducking down behind some trees at a different part of the
clearing-- as the SOLDIERS DRAGGING THE TEENAGERS near his
position--

He readies his gun as Sarah and Kenny catch up to him--

SARAH (CONTD)
Right behind you

Danny looks over at her--

SARAH (CONTD)
You got your safety off

He nods

SARAH (CONTD)
Alright

Sarah raises her own rifle
SARAH (CONTD)
Danny if you just got me killed
I’m gonna be pissed

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH

As he bursts out of the woods running toward Pete and the
other prisoners--

Aiming his rifle as a STRUGGLE breaks out ahead of him--

It’s PETE-- refusing to get on the bus He somehow breaks
free--

One of the SOLDIERS swings his gun toward Pete--
BANG Snaggletooth FIRES FIRST dropping the guy--
WITH DANNY AND SARAH

As the SOLDIERS dragging the teenagers react to the gunfire--
letting go of their prisoners as they draw their weapons--

BANG Sarah DROPS one of the SOLDIERS as the teenagers
scramble out of the way--

SARAH (CONTD)
Now

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM Danny and Sarah both OPEN FIRE on
the soldiers mowing a couple of them down--

The others quickly drop to the ground behind some PICNIC
TABLES RETURNING FIRE--

Our guys duck back as BULLETS TEAR INTO THE TREES all around
them--

DANNY
Holy shit

Danny looks over at Sarah then at Kenny as it hits him--

DANNY (CONTD)
I just killed that guy

SARAH
Better him than us

She leans out FIRING BACK--

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM He takes out the other SOLDIER who was
watching over the kids-- and then YET ANOTHER ONE as the guy
steps off the bus--

Pete looks over at Snaggletooth stunned as he finally
reaches the group--

PETE
-Snag

SNAGGLETOOTH
GET DOWN

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The BUS’S WINDOWS EXPLODE IN A SHOWER OF
GLASS as the SOLDIERS at the picnic tables OPEN FIRE on their
position--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
EVERYBODY GET DOWN BEHIND THE BUS

WITH DANNY AND SARAH

FIRING AWAY from behind the trees-- BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-- taking
out another one of the soldiers--

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH

As he pulls a KNIFE quickly cutting through Pete’s plastic
handcuffs--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
How you doin’ buddy You alright
These your friends

Pete nods-- too shocked to process it-- as BULLETS continue
to WHIZ by all around them--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
I know you’re pretty freaked out
right now Pete but I need you to
do something for me
He hands the KNIFE to Pete--
SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
I need you to cut everyone else
loose while I clear us a path out
of here alright
Pete nods-- starts cutting the others loose--

As Snaggletooth cautiously makes his way over to the edge of
the bus--

And RETURNS FIRE on the SOLDIERS at the picnic tables--
WITH DANNY AND SARAH
Also FIRING at the same group--

Danny MOWS ONE OF THEM DOWN as the soldier charges toward the
bus--

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The others make one final attempt to storm
Danny and Sarah’s position-- but she CUTS THEM DOWN--

Then for a half second it’s QUIET

Across from them Snaggletooth peeks out from behind the bus
and waves--

Just as the HUMVEE at the far end of the clearing SCREECHES
TO LIFE racing toward him--

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH

As Pete finishes cutting through the last of the other kids’
handcuffs--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
EVERYBODY RUN GET OUT OF HERE
WITH DANNY AND SARAH

Watching in horror as the Humvee bears down on Snaggletooth’s
position--

SARAH
Danny We gotta go

WITH SNAGGLETOOTH
As the Humvee’s SPOTLIGHT locks onto him and the kids--

SNAGGLETOOTH
GET GOING NOW MOVE IT

The kids scatter in all directions as the Humvee OPENS FIRE--
WITH DANNY AND SARAH

Danny instinctively swings his rifle toward the Humvee but
Sarah pulls him back--

SARAH
That fifty cal will tear right
through these trees
(then)
Cmon we gotta fall back
WITH SNAGGLETOOTH
As he sprints out from behind the bus and onto the access

road FIRING HIS GUN at the Humvee drawing it away from the
other kids--

SNAGGLETOOTH (0S)
COME ON YOU ASSHOLES

The Humvee whips its spotlight after him giving chase--

PETE (0S)
Snag

Snaggletooth turns to see Pete running after him--
SNAGGLETOOTH (0OS)
Pete Go Get away from me Find
your friends and hide

As the Humvee accelerates after them--

WITH DANNY AND SARAH

As Snaggletooth and Pete disappear from view pursued by the
Humvee-—

SARAH
Cmon We’re done

But Danny doesn’t move He just sits there frozen in place

EXT PARK ACCESS ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Snaggletooth and Pete sprint down the access road the
Humvee’s spotlight BLASTING on their backs--

SNAGGLETOOTH (0S)
Go Pete Get out of here

Pete looks over at him unsure--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
GO GODDAMNIT

Snaggletooth PUSHES him toward a TRAIL coming up on their
right--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
GOGO GO

Pete darts off disappearing down the trail-- as Snaggletooth
turns back toward the Humvee OPENING FIRE--

SNAGGLETOOTH (CONTD)
BRING IT

The Humvee follows him ignoring Pete--

Snaggletooth turns running forward again as fast as he can--
The Humvee bearing down on him--

Closer closer closer--

Snaggletooth whirls around OPENING FIRE one last time--

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM 50 CALIBER FLASHES BLIND THE CAMERA--

WHICH JERKS INTO THE AIR FOR A MOMENT before--

SMASHING TO BLACK as Snaggletooth crumples to the ground

EXT PARK EDGE OF THE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

Sarah gently pulls Danny back into the woods

SARAH
Danny they’re not coming back

He shakes his head fighting back tears

SARAH (CONT’D)
He’s gone You’ve gotta let it go

EXT WOODED HILLSIDE - LATER

Our kids scramble up the heavily wooded hillside using
FLASHLIGHTS attached to THEIR GUNS to see where they’re
going

KENNY
(panting)
Guys hold on

DANNY
You okay

KENNY
Yeah I just need to rest a sec

The other kids all gather around finding places to sit

KENNY (CONTD)
I feel like we’ve been climbing
this hill for hours

Danny fishes a bottle of water out of his backpack and takes
a sip

DANNY
Water

Jake takes the bottle from Danny and drinks then passes it
over to Sarah

SARAH
I don’t suppose any of you actually
knows where the hell we’re
going

JAKE
I think we wanna just keep heading
east

SARAH

You mean north East is that way

Sarah points off to the side of the hill

JAKE
Doh

Danny takes out his map

DANNY
Right now we’re in here
somewhere

He traces along their route with his fingertip

DANNY (CONTD)
We wanna keep going north for a
little while maybe another mile
mile and a half then cut east If
we do it too soon we’ll end up
back in town

A dog BARKS from somewhere behind them Sarah reflexively
leaps to her feet

SARAH
Kill the lights

They quickly switch off their flashlights scanning the
darkness

SARAH (CONTD)
Shit

FAR BELOW-- FLASHLIGHT BEAMS sweep through the woods as
DOZENS of SOLDIERS with GERMAN SHEPHERDS slowly make their
way up the hillside

JAKE
I guess that settles that Nowhere
to go but up
EXT WOODED HILLSIDE - LATER

Our guys scramble up the hillside in near total darkness
coming to a flat area

JAKE
I can’t see a thing How far have
we gone

KENNY

Id say about a mile

DANNY
I think it’s leveling off We can
probably cut over now What do you
guys think

The kids scan the darkness

SARAH
What’s that Do you see that

Sarah points at a faint patch of LIGHT just up ahead barely
visible through the trees

EXT CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

The kids stumble out of the woods finding themselves at the
edge of an enormous grassy clearing The woods stretch out
on both sides of them with some mountains in the distance

SARAH
Alright Let’s head east but stay
close to the trees We’ve only got
another half hour before it gets
light out

Sarah walks off to the right along the edge of the clearing
The others follow

KENNY
Do you guys hear something

JAKE
Hear what

Everyone stops to listen At first we can’t hear anything
but then a QUIET LAUGH breaks the silence followed by
WHISPERING

SARAH
Over there

She points out across the clearing

Several FIGURES walk parallel to them through the middle of
the clearing

KENNY
Soldiers

The kids stare out into the darkness-- it’s impossible to
tell

DANNY
I don’t think so

As they listen a different sound a faint MECHANICAL SOUND
becomes audible-- the WHOOPING of a helicopter--

SARAH
Get back

The kids dart back taking cover in some bushes-- just as the
helicopter rises into view behind them its SPOTLIGHT SHINING
DOWN through the trees--

They watch in horror as the blinding spotlight slowly passes
over them--

DANNY
Can they see us

Nobody answers

The helicopter hovers above them for a beat-- then suddenly
swoops off towards the middle of the clearing-- training its
spotlight onto the FIGURES they saw earlier--

TWENTY TEENAGERS walking across the clearing suddenly freeze
as the spotlight hits them-- They look up for a second as
though unsure what to do then scatter in all directions-—-

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM GUNFIRE ERUPTS from
the far side of the clearing--

DANNY (CONTD)
Oh God

SOLDIERS step out from the trees FIRING their guns at the
now SCREAMING TEENAGERS--—

The helicopter darts around keeping the kids visible in its
spotlight while the soldiers continue FIRING--

KENNY
What do we do

A dog BARKS from somewhere behind them

KENNY (CONTD)
(panicking)

We can’t go back We can’t go

forward

DANNY
Kenny shut up
Kenny looks at him hurt

DANNY (CONTD)
Sorry That’s just not very helpful
right now

JAKE
He’s right though What are we
gonna do Those dogs will lead them
right to us

SARAH
Let’s double back Retrace our
steps

Everyone looks at her

JAKE
You know what’s funny I could’ve
sworn you just said “let’s double
back and retrace our steps” But I
know I must’ve misheard you because
THAT WOULD BE BATSHIT INSANE

SARAH
I’ve got an idea I don’t know if
it’ll work but it beats staying
here

EXT WOODED HILLSIDE - NIGHT

The kids hurry back down the hillside running blindly
through the trees

DANNY
This is exactly the same way we
came up We’re gonna run right into
them

Sarah skids to a halt

SARAH
Stop

The others follow her lead as several FLASHLIGHT BEAMS
suddenly become visible down below--

SARAH (CONTD)
Alright Everyone pick a tree and
start climbing

DANNY
That’s your plan We’re gonna climb
trees

SARAH
Just do it

Sarah slings her gun over her shoulder and grabs onto the
closest tree The others watch her for a moment then do the
same--

WITH DANNY as he puts his hands on a large branch and hoists
himself up--

WITH SARAH climbing steadily hand over hand--

WITH KENNY going carefully from branch to branch moving
much slower than the others--

WITH JAKE already a good twenty feet off the ground pauses
to look down--

The SOLDIERS are now fully visible about fifty feet away--
The LEAD SOLDIER hurries after a large German Shepherd
keeping his flashlight trained on the ground just ahead of
the dog--

WITH DANNY keeping as still and quiet as possible--

As the lead soldier follows his dog over to the base of
Danny’s tree--

The dog starts pawing at the trunk--

The soldier looks up aiming his flashlight into the branches-

He stands there for what seems like eternity checking the
tree--

Until one of the other dogs suddenly starts BARKING FURIOUSLY-

SOLDIER (0S)
THIS WAY THEY WENT UP THE HILL

The soldiers continue on their dogs following the scent from
where the kids doubled back

Our guys wait for a long beat then start climbing down

Sarah reaches the ground first followed by Jake a few
seconds later and then Danny

JAKE
(to Sarah)
Good thinking Rips

Sarah looks up at the flashlight beams sweeping the hillside
above them

SARAH
Weve probably only got a few
minutes before they figure out what
we did

Jake looks up at Kenny who’s still making his way cautiously
down the last few branches of his tree

JAKE
Just jump bro

Kenny looks at them for a second then jumps
BANG He stumbles on impact DISCHARGING his rifle
The kids look at each other shit

They look back up the hill to see the soldiers’ flashlight
beams swinging back in their direction--

SARAH
Run

They do cutting sideways through the brush

EXT WOODED HILLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Danny ducks and dives through the heavy brush the others
running next to him--

He risks a look back--
--to see flashlights sweeping the woods just behind them--
BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The soldiers OPEN FIRE--

BULLETS WHIZ past Danny’s head as he races blindly through
the woods tree branches slapping him in the face--

Suddenly the forest opens up right in front of him
revealing an ENORMOUS CLIFF
EXT WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS

The kids all come screeching to a stop near the top of a
GIANT WATERFALL They stare down-- it must be at least a

hundred feet the bottom invisible in the darkness--

SARAH
Weve gotta jump

JAKE
Hells no

They look back-- to see the FLASHLIGHT BEAMS getting closer--

Jake glances down at the water then turns to the others--

JAKE (CONTD)
Not it

It takes a moment for them to realize what he’s saying then--

SARAH
Not it

DANNY
Not it

Kenny looks at them incredulous
KENNY
Not it Are you fucking kidding me
What is this first grade

JAKE
Dude You’re it

KENNY
I’m not jumping off that

Danny looks back at the approaching FLASHLIGHT BEAMS--

DANNY
Rock paper scissors

JAKE
Fuck it I’m going

Jake JUMPS--

The others watch him fall disappearing into the darkness--

Seconds later a distant SPLASH rings out from below

DANNY
Whoa
Danny looks at Sarah and Kenny

KENNY
I can’t do it

SARAH
Yeah you can

Sarah grabs their rifles and throws them off the cliff--

DANNY
We’re never gonna find those

SARAH
We might

She turns to Kenny

SARAH (CONTD)
Take off your glasses

Kenny removes his glasses fingers trembling and puts them
in a zippered pocket

SARAH (CONTD)
Gimme your hand

He does

SARAH (CONTD)
You ready

Kenny shakes his head no

SARAH (CONT’D)
Here we go

She JUMPS pulling Kenny with her--
As FLASHLIGHT BEAMS sweep over the edge of the cliff--

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM Danny JUMPS as GUNFIRE erupts out of the
forest--

WITH DANNY-- the footage from his camera nothing more than a
DARK BLUR as he falls through space--

SPLASH

IE RIVER - CONTINUOUS

FOOTAGE FROM DANNY’S CAMERA-- TOTAL CHAOS as he HITS THE
WATER-—

AUDIO cutting from UNDERWATER BUBBLING SOUNDS to Danny
GASPING FOR AIR as he finally breaks surface again--

In the midst of the mayhem we catch a GLIMPSE OF SKY and
realize that it’s starting to get light out--

A HORRENDOUS ROAR growing louder--

Someone’s POV-- as we go flying over a small WATERFALL--
SCREAMING--

MORE CHAOS-- BUBBLES WHITE WATER--

Somewhere in the middle of it we hear a loud THUNK

DANNY (0S)
SARAH

QUICK GLIMPSE-- a DARK SHAPE on the water--
BUBBLES CHAOS--
Another THUNK and the CAMERA GOES BLACK--

Over DARKNESS we hear Danny calling her name growing more
and more panicky--

DANNY (0S) (CONTD)
SARAH SARAH

We hear him breathing hard saying something unintelligible
over the WATER and then--

DANNY (CONTD)
HELP KENNY JAKE

EXT RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS

WITH KENNY AND JAKE already out of the river as they hear
Danny screaming--

JAKE
Danny

DANNY
HELP ME

They see him floating down the river and both charge in--
helping him pull her back to shore--

JAKE
What happened

DANNY
She must have hit her head

They carry Sarah up onto the riverbank and set her down
Danny checks her breathing--

DANNY (CONTD)
Damnit

He pinches her nose and blows into her mouth twice watching
as her chest rises each time--

DANNY (CONTD)
Gimme some room

Danny puts his hands on Sarah’s chest and begins pushing down
in quick bursts while Jake and Kenny move back helpless to
do anything--

Danny counts off under his breath Twenty three Twenty
Four Twenty five

Sarah’s lifeless eyes stare up at the pre-dawn sky

DANNY (CONT’D)
Come on Sarah breathe

He leans over breathing into her mouth again

DANNY (CONTD)
God please don’t do this

Jake reaches out putting a hand on Danny’s shoulder

JAKE
Bro

Danny ignores him starts counting out loud
DANNY
Twenty seven Twenty eight Twenty
nine Thirty Come on Sarah

He breathes into her mouth

JAKE
Danny

Danny suddenly stops

JAKE (CONT’D)
She’s gone man I’m sorry

Danny looks at Jake for a beat fighting back tears then
shakes his head and starts pushing down on her chest again

DANNY
One two three four Sarah
cmon

THUMP Danny hits her on the chest with his fist

DANNY (CONTD)
BREATHE GODDAMNIT

THUMP
Jake tries to pull Danny away but he fights him off--
DANNY (CONTD)
Don’t you touch me You want to
keep going and save your own ass
then go That’s all you care about
anyway But I’m not leaving her

Danny looks back down at Sarah

DANNY (CONTD)
IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING YOU

THUMP

WATER COMES RUSHING out of Sarah’s mouth She turns on her
side RETCHING and GASPING for air

Danny stares down at her tears streaming down his face

Sarah stares up at him breathing hard

EXT WOODS - DAY

The kids make their way through the woods with Danny helping
Sarah along keeping one of her arms draped over his
shoulder

They walk in silence for a moment then

KENNY
You guys remember “for reals”

Jake and Danny both chuckle

DANNY
Oh God

SARAH
What’s “for reals”

KENNY
Back in middle school Snag used to
do this thing where he’d say “for
reals” at the end of every
sentence

DANNY
It was the most horrible thing
ever

JAKE
For reals

Danny smiles

DANNY
Don’t even start

JAKE
For reals

Danny flips him off They walk in silence for a moment
KENNY
You know what the worst part is I

think he got it from his dad

JAKE
For reals

Danny lets go of Sarah in order to go after Jake fake
fighting--

SARAH
Guys

Off her expression the others turn to see-- a CABIN up
ahead just barely visible through the trees

IE CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

The kids cautiously approach the front of two story cabin

DANNY
People actually live up here

KENNY
I doubt it
(off their looks)
No power lines no driveway It’s
probably like a hunting lodge or
something

Jake walks up to the front door and KNOCKS No answer He
tries the handle but it’s locked

MOMENTS LATER

Jake throws a large rock through a small window SHATTERING
IT

He clears away the glass and climbs in opening the door for
the others

As they step in--

JAKE
Not bad huh

DANNY
Not bad After what we’ve been
through this is like the
freakin’ Bellagio

JAKE
I saw a generator outside I’m
gonna go turn it on

Kenny moves over toward some kitchen cabinets opens them up--
to reveal TONS OF FOOD on the other side

KENNY
Who’s hungry
INT CABIN - LATER

COUNTRY MUSIC plays from an old tape player The kids sit at
a wooden table

Danny cycles through their cell phones trying each one
while Kenny dishes out their breakfast

JAKE
(re the cells)
Any luck

Danny shakes his head

DANNY
They’re all fried Even if we can
get to a place that has reception
we’re not gonna be able to use
them

JAKE
Rice trick bro

DANNY
That’s for water damage This is
more like water destruction

SARAH
Who would we even call anyway the
cops

They look at each other for a moment but nobody has an
immediate answer

Kenny ends the conversation by setting down the last of the
food--

KENNY
Let’s eat

They don’t need to be told twice They dig in

Nobody saying anything for several seconds

Then
JAKE
--holy crap
KENNY
It’s not a race bro
JAKE
Yeah it is
LATER

Post meal Everyone still sitting at the table surrounded by
MOUNTAINS of dishes It looks like a tornado went through

SARAH
I forgot what food taste like

Danny nods only semi-conscious as a food coma sets in--
DANNY

Kenny I swear that was the best
breakfast I’ve ever had

SARAH
He’s right You should go to
cooking school

JAKE
Cooking school

SARAH
Yeah They have schools for that

JAKE
But Kenny’s smart Kenny’s gonna go
to math school or something

SARAH
Kenny you do have a say in this
What brings you more joy math or
cooking And be honest

Kenny thinks for a second

KENNY
(realizing)
Cooking

He looks over at the others adding somewhat guiltily

KENNY (CONT’D)
I mean you know I do really like
math a lot though

SARAH
You don’t have to apologize It’s
not like math is gonna take it
personally

A TEAPOT WHISTLES and Kenny stands up

KENNY
Coffee time

SARAH
(orgasm)
Coffee
Kenny walks into the kitchen and takes the kettle off as--
THE FRONT DOOR SUDDENLY FLIES OPEN--
Everyone jumping out of their seats as RJ-- 50s very fit--

storms into the cabin leveling a SHOTGUN at the kitchen
table--

JAKE
Holy shit

SARAH
Don’t shoot don’t shoot

The kids raise their hands in the air

JAKE
It’s a mistake
DANNY
We didn’t think anyone lived here

Honestly
WITH KENNY
In the kitchen-- RJ hasn’t noticed he’s there yet--
BACK WITH THE OTHERS

As RJ sizes them up taking in their dirty torn clothing and
the gash on Sarah’s head--

RI
You kids came out through the
river didn’t you It took you
right out of the quarantine

They look at each other

JAKE
We’re out of the quarantine

WITH KENNY

As he picks up an IRON SKILLET silently creeping toward RJ
from behind--

RI
And that means you’re infected
all of you

JAKE
Why don’t we just put the gun down
so we can work this out
RJ swings his gun toward Jake--
RI
Sorry kid but I don’t plan on
getting sick

Kenny swings the skillet as hard as he can-- WHACK--

BANG RJs shotgun FIRES harmlessly into the ceiling as he
crumples to the ground knocked out cold

Jake quickly scrambles over picking up the shotgun

KENNY
What are we gonna do with him We
can’t just let him go or he’1l turn
us in

They consider their options for a moment

DANNY
Guys

Everyone turns toward Danny

DANNY (CONT’D)
I know we all wanna get back to
civilization Especially now that
weve had a taste of it

He glances down at Ru

DANNY (CONT’D)
But this is our chance To find out
once and for all if we’re really
carriers

Jake looks at Danny for a beat then nods

JAKE
You’re right
(to the group)
Change of plan We’re gonna stay a
while

INT CABIN - NIGHT

DANNY FINISHES PUTTING UP A “PRISONER CAM” so that it looks
down on RJ who sits on the floor hands tied to a chair
behind his back

DANNY
I know this must really suck but
if we are carrying this thing
then you’re already infected so we
might as well stick around and find
out for sure

Danny takes a seat on the couch RJ’s shotgun rests on a
coffee table just in front of him along with a box of ammo

DANNY (CONTD)
If you get sick it means we
can’t go on

RJ
How could you not be infected It
killed off your entire town

DANNY
It only killed off the adults
They’re the ones killing kids

RJ
I’ve seen the bodies on the news

DANNY
Whatever you saw it was staged

RJ
And I’m supposed to take your word
for it

DANNY
Listen If you don’t get sick I

swear to God we’ll let you go We
don’t want to hurt anyone

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Danny sits on a chair addressing camera
DANNY
if nothing else this has
definitely been the craziest day of
my life

Danny looks off screen as a door opens

DANNY (CONT’D)
Hey what’s up

SARAH (0S)
There’s only two bedrooms

Danny looks up at her doesn’t get it--
SARAH (0S) (CONT’D)
So unless you want me to crash

with Jake

Danny bolts up walking off screen--

DANNY (0S)
No weve got plenty of room in
here Let me just clear some of
this junk off the bed for you
Ill sleep on the floor

Sarah passes by the CAMERA-- we can’t see much because the
camera is only at waist level-- but we can see that she’s
SLIPPING OFF HER SHIRT--

DANNY (0S) (CONTD)
--oh

We hear some FUMBLING as they make out for a moment--
See some SHOES bouncing on the floor--
Hear something UNZIPPING--

A SOCKED FOOT crashes into the lens bringing the camera to
the floor so that we are now looking at the base of the bed--

And then a pause

SARAH (0S)
What’s wrong

DANNY (0S)
Ioum I don’t really know what
I’m doing

SARAH (0S)
It’s okay We don’t have to I just
figured with the world ending and
all

DANNY (0S)
No I want to I was just giving
you a heads up

More clothes drop down on the floor COVERING THE LENS

INT CABIN - DAY
SWITCHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT “PRISONER” CAMS

Jake sits on the floor across from RJ taking his temperature
with a digital thermometer

JAKE
Sorry man But Kenny wants us to
record all this crap so that we’1ll
know right away if you start
getting sick

He takes the thermometer out checks the reading

JAKE (CONTD)
Normal

He writes it down on a piece of paper

DANNY (0S)
Morning

Jake turns as Danny comes down from upstairs

JAKE
Morning It’s like three o’clock
bro

DANNY

Yeah I was up kinda late

JAKE
Oh really

Danny smiles sheepishly glances over at RJ

DANNY
How’s he doing

JAKE
He’s not talking and he won’t eat
But his vitals and shit look okay
DANNY

(to RJ)
Dude you’ve gotta eat

No response
Danny looks back at Jake

DANNY (CONT’D)
You know where Sarah is

JAKE
She said she was going for a walk

DANNY
I’m gonna go see if I can find her

Jake nods turning back to RJ as Danny walks out the door

JAKE
I know you’re pissed but what do
you think we’re gonna do poison
you
(shakes head)
I’m gonna go make you a sandwich
bro whether you like it or not

As Jake walks off leaving frame we see RJ moving his hands

up and down RUBBING HIS BINDS up against the chair he’s tied
to

EXT RIVERBANK —- DAY

HANDHELD FOOTAGE of Sarah sitting alone on the riverbank in
the exact spot where Danny resuscitated her

There’s a HEAVY MIST in the air and the whole image has a
dreamy atmospheric vibe

After a long moment Sarah stops as though sensing something
and turns toward camera

SARAH
What are you doing

DANNY (0S)
What are you doing

Danny walks over sitting down beside her

SARAH
Don’t be creeping I don’t like it

DANNY (0S)

Sorry it just looked so
peaceful with the light and
everything I couldn’t help it

They sit in silence for a moment

SARAH
You know what’s weird

DANNY (0S)
What’s that

SARAH
I died yesterday

DANNY (0S)
Yeah That totally sucked by the
way Don’t do that again

Sarah smiles softly at him for a beat then--

SARAH
There was this moment in the
middle of it all where it was
like I was up above my body looking
down and I could see you there
trying to save me

She looks back out at the river

SARAH (CONT’D)
And this probably sounds stupid
but the thing is I’ve always felt
alone in some way Danny Like it’s
always been me against the whole
fucking world But in that
moment it just didn’t feel like
that at all Because there you
were right in front of me

Sarah looks back at Danny her eyes welling up

SARAH (CONTD)
So then I just started praying
“God if you’re there please
give me one more shot I promise I
won’t mess it up Just give me one
more chance”

Sarah somehow manages to smile

SARAH (CONTD)
Next thing I knew there I was
barfing all over the place

INT CABIN - DAY

Jake sits on the couch flipping through an old PLAYBOY
oblivious to the fact that RJ CONTINUES TO WORK HIS BINDS
against the chair

JAKE
Asian chicks man I don’t know
what it is but they really do it
for me What about you

Jake glances at RJ

JAKE (CONTD)
That’s okay you don’t have to say
anything I can tell by the look in
your eyes that you know exactly
what I’m talking about

RJs binds finally slip off his wrists and fall to the floor--
but Jake can’t see them from where he sits on the couch--

RI
It’s Jake right

Jake looks over at him

JAKE
Hey he talks

RJ nods toward a massive SANDWICH sitting on the edge of the
table

RI
That sandwich is starting to look
pretty good after all
JAKE
Cool I know this situation blows
man We’ve just gotta make the best
of it
Jake picks up the sandwich offering him a bite--

In a flash RJ lashes out PUNCHING him in the face--

Jake falls to the ground stunned RJ climbs on top of him
PUNCHING him again and again until he stops moving

RJ darts over to a JACKET hanging near the door and takes out
a CELL PHONE

He turns it on
Waiting as the screen flashes to life
And then dialing 9-1-1
RJ
(beat)

I need the sheriff’s station

RJ turns back toward Jake-- to see Jake reaching for the
SHOTGUN--

RJ (CONTD)
No

RJ leaps onto him They struggle with RJ on top and the
shotgun wedged between them pointed down--

BANG Jake suddenly stops struggling a look of total shock
on his face--

RJ climbs off of him-- revealing a giant WOUND in Jake’s
thigh--

EXT WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

Danny and Sarah race through the woods running blindly
through the fog--

DANNY (0S)
You’re sure it was a gunshot

SARAH
Positive It was muffled like it
came from inside

INT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

RJ kneels over Jake holding a jacket over his wound while
talking on his cell phone--

RI
Thirty two hundred Galbraith
lane Yeah about five miles past
Harrison

The door suddenly opens and RJ grabs the shotgun leveling it
at Kenny as he steps inside carrying an armful of freshly
picked apples--

KENNY
Holy shit

Kenny drops the apples all over the floor as RJ motions with
the shotgun guiding him over toward Jake--

RI
Use the jacket Keep pressure on
his leg

Kenny does as he’s told

RJ (CONTD)
(into his phone)
No There’s four of ‘em But one’s
hurt pretty bad
(then)
(MORE)

RJ (CONTD)
You really think there’s a chance I
haven’t been infected

EXT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Danny and Sarah-- finally reaching the front door-- only to
have RJ shove the gun in their faces--

RI
Why don’t you two step inside

INT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

RJ stands near the door holding the shotgun at waist level
keeping it pointed in the general direction of Danny and
Sarah who sit on the couch

Jake YELPS as Kenny cinches down on a belt wrapped around the
top of his leg creating a tourniquet

KENNY
Sorry

Jake shoots a look at RJ

JAKE
(weakly)
Next time shoot me in the head or
something

RJ doesn’t respond

DANNY
What do you think they’re gonna do
RJ Let you go

RJ shifts the gun slightly so that it’s pointed directly at
Danny’s head

RI
I’m getting real tired of all the
yapping kid

DANNY
They’re gonna kill us all Yourself
included

RI

I said shut the hell up

SARAH
Danny

DANNY
What What difference does it make
if he shoots us now or if they do
it when they get here

As if on cue we hear the sound of a HELICOPTER
APPROACHING

DANNY (CONT’D)
Perfect

The SOUND GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER RJ goes over to a window
and peeks out

RI
Here they come

He walks over to the front door and steps out holding the
shotgun off to his side--

RJ (CONTD)
OVER HERE

BANG RJ FLIES BACKWARD-- hitting the ground with a loud
THUMP

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

BACK TO INDIVIDUAL SHOULDER CAMS

The kids hit the ground as BULLETS RIP into the cabin all
around them--

In a flash Sarah grabs RJ’s shotgun retreating back into
the cabin and kicking the door closed at the same time--

SARAH
Out the back Kitchen window GO

Danny grabs Jake helping him to his feet--
SARAH (CONTD)
Get him outside and just keep
going I’1l catch up

Danny nods He and Kenny help Jake over to the kitchen while
Sarah ducks down behind a side window and looks out--

SOLDIERS-- barely visible through the fog-- streaming toward
them out of the woods--

EXT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny opens the kitchen window and jumps out then turns back
to help Danny get Jake out--

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Sarah catches sight of a soldier creeping along the side of
the house and raises her shotgun--

BANG The man goes down--

She looks back-- to see Danny slipping out of the kitchen
window--

She stands grabbing the box of ammo off the coffee table and
slipping it into her pocket--

EXT CABIN - CONTINUOUS
Danny and Kenny run on either side of Jake helping him along
as they make their way into the woods behind the cabin

disappearing into the fog--

WITH SARAH climbing out of the window still carrying the
shotgun--

She creeps over to the side of the building and looks out
around the corner-- to see ANOTHER SOLDIER walking toward
her the only one visible through the heavy fog--

BANG He crumples to the ground--

Suddenly the whole front of the cabin ERUPTS in GUNFIRE as
more soldiers OPEN FIRE We can’t see the men themselves
only the soft glow of their MUZZLE FLASHES in the mist--

Sarah races off as BULLETS tear into the cabin and the
surrounding trees--

She runs blindly through the fog quickly catching up to the
others who can’t run very fast because of Jake’s injury--

SARAH
Hurry

DANNY
We’re going as fast as we can

The sound of DOGS BARKING rings out behind them--

SARAH
We can’t outrun them

JAKE
You mean not with me you can’t

SARAH
I mean not if they’ve got dogs

DANNY
Guys

Jake suddenly stumbles as his leg cramps up

JAKE
Shit
Everyone stops
DANNY
Jake c’mon man we’ve gotta keep

moving

Jake tries putting weight on the leg-- GASPING as the pain
overwhelms him--

JAKE
I can’t

Jake shakes his head
JAKE (CONTD)
Goddamnit Why’d that dumbass have
to shoot me
Another BARK sounds out this time a lot closer than before--

Sarah turns to Jake

SARAH
What do you wanna do

Jake looks at her for a moment a silent understanding
passing between the two of them

JAKE
Get me over to those rocks

Danny follows Jake’s eyes over to some BOULDERS lying nearby
He shakes his head

DANNY
No way We’re not gonna leave you
here

JAKE
Just do it There’s no time to
argue Danny

Danny doesn’t move
Another BARK

JAKE (CONTD)
DAMNIT

Jake starts limping towards the boulders on his own

SARAH
Give him a hand

Danny and Kenny help Jake over to the rocks while Sarah takes
up the rear walking backwards keeping the shotgun aimed
back the way they came

The boys set Jake down behind the rocks in such a way as to
provide some cover from the advancing soldiers

DANNY
Screw it We’ll stay here with
you

Danny looks back at Kenny and Sarah

DANNY (CONTD)
Right

Kenny’s face is white as a sheet and he’s literally trembling
with fear-- but somehow he still manages to nod his head in
agreement

Sarah looks at Jake
SARAH

This is your call If you want us
to stay We’ll stay

JAKE
Just gimme the gun Rips
DANNY
No Don’t
(to Jake)

We’re not gonna leave you

JAKE
What’re you gonna do throw rocks
at ‘em There’s only one gun
(to Sarah)
(MORE )

JAKE (CONTD)
Give it to me I’1l hold them off
as long as I can

Sarah hands the shotgun over to Jake along with the box of
shells Jake checks to make sure it’s fully loaded

SARAH
Jake

He looks up at her

SARAH (CONTD)
Take out the dogs first

He gives her a grim nod

DANNY
We can’t just leave him here

JAKE
Yeah Danny You can

Danny shakes his head unable to speak
JAKE (CONTD)
It’s okay bro Don’t worry about
me worry about those two

Danny looks over at Sarah and Kenny

JAKE (CONTD)
--eworry about yourself

Danny looks back at Jake

JAKE (CONTD)
You can’t always save the world
Danny Sometimes you’ve gotta just
save your own ass You got me

Beat

DANNY
Yeah I got you

Jake holds out his fist Danny reaches out bumping it with
his own

JAKE
Now go Run Get out of here and
don’t ever slow down

Suddenly GUNFIRE ERUPTS from deep within the fog behind
them BULLETS RIPPING into the trees above their heads

JAKE (CONTD)
GO

Danny takes one last look at his friend then bolts after
Sarah and Kenny disappearing into the mist

After a moment the gunfire stops and everything grows QUIET

Jake turns back towards the approaching soldiers propping
the shotgun up on top of the rocks

He waits

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Danny Sarah and Kenny run through the fog at full speed
dodging the trees and branches which constantly appear right
in front of them without any warning--

EXT WOODS ROCKPILE - CONTINUOUS

Jake stares into the fog

For a long time we can’t see anything at all through the
swirling mist And then the SHAPE of a SNARLING DOG coming
toward us--

Jake pulls the trigger twice BANG BANG

The DOG GOES DOWN and suddenly it’s quiet again

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Danny looks back reacting to the SHOT but Sarah pulls him
forward--

SARAH
Cmon
EXT WOODS ROCKPILE - CONTINUOUS

BACK WITH JAKE-- as we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
accompanied by the PANTING of another dog

He slowly peeks up over the edge of the rockpile-- to see
SOLDIERS creeping toward him through the fog--

He raises the shotgun sighting it at their DOG--

BANG

The DOG GOES DOWN but now the soldiers have a fix on his
position-- They whirl toward him OPENING FIRE--

BULLETS PING into the rocks all around us--

Jake ducks down fumbling some shells out of the box of ammo
and re-loading-- as the soldiers continue FIRING on his
position--

EXT WOODS HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

Danny stops again looking back as the distant MUZZLE FLASHES
light up the dark forest--

SARAH
Danny We’ve gotta keep going

She pulls him forward again as the GUNFIRE STOPS

KENNY
I don’t know if we can

Off his look they turn-- to see a steep cliff like
formation rising up in front of them disappearing into the
fog--

DANNY
Shit

They look to the left and to the right-- the cliff continues
in both directions

SARAH
With their suits and their guns
they’re gonna have a harder time
climbing than we are I say we keep
going up

Danny looks at Kenny Kenny shrugs

DANNY
Let’s do it

They begin to climb

EXT WOODS ROCKPILE - CONTINUOUS

Jake sits in silence for a beat clutching the shotgun
listening It’s starting to get dark making it even harder
to see anything through the heavy fog

SNAP A branch breaks from somewhere behind him and Jake
whirls around

But he can’t see anything

He hears another FOOTSTEP right in front of him - but still
no sign of the soldiers--

Movement-- in the fog-- out of the corner of his eye BANG
Jake fires another shot

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM The soldiers OPEN FIRE from within the woods-

The BULLETS TEAR INTO JAKE-- he drops the gun falling
backward onto the ground--

HIS CAMERA NOW POINTS STRAIGHT UP-- as he lies there his
BREATHING now LOUD and ERRATIC--

SOLDIERS-- creep out of the fog securing the area--

One of them keeps an eye on Jake while the others fan back
out into the woods switching on the FLASHLIGHTS attached to
their machine guns as they go--

The soldier who stayed behind looks down at Jake watching as
he GASPS for air--

He raises his machine gun--

But just as he’s about to pull the trigger he suddenly
DOUBLES OVER COUGHING VIOLENTLY--

The SOLDIER RIPS OFF HIS MASK-- BLOOD EXPLODING out of his
mouth--

As the coughing fit subsides the soldier-- who’s in his 20s
and not all that much older than Jake-- wipes the blood off
his mouth a horrified expression slowly crossing his face

JAKE (0S)
- why

The soldier looks down at him for a long beat before giving
him a defeated shrug

SOLDIER
Because even though you guys will
never get sick you can still give
it to everyone else

He and Jake lock eyes for a moment

SOLDIER (CONT’D)
And I’ve got kids of my own
Jake’s BREATHING becomes HARD and FAST

SOLDIER (CONT’D)
-I’m sorry

And then everything goes QUIET

EXT HILLTOP - NIGHT

Danny Sarah and Kenny emerge from some heavy brush to find
themselves up above the fog layer near the top of a large
hill

Danny looks up at the stars for a moment then back down the
way they came

Several flashlight beams continue to sweep through the valley
down below-- but none appear to be headed up the cliff after
them

KENNY
They’ve lost our trail

SARAH
For now

Off their looks--

SARAH (CONTD)
Let’s keep moving

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WOODS - DAWN

The kids shuffle through the woods almost looking like
zombies weak tired and hungry

SARAH
We must be halfway to Mexico by
now

DANNY

It’s true But you know what As
tired as I am-- and I’ve never been
so exhausted in my life-- right
now I feel like I could walk
forever if I had to If that’s what
it took

KENNY
It’s like the harder everything
gets the more you wanna just keep
going

DANNY
The closer you get to dying the
more you wanna live

SARAH
Wow That is some insightful
shit

Sarah pauses as they come to a steep embankment

SARAH (CONTD)
Don’t get me wrong I’d rather have
a hot shower and something to eat
but still

They continue forward half walking half sliding down the
embankment

SARAH (CONTD)
I do find it truly deeply
insightful

EXT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

The kids stumble out of the woods and onto a road - only to
find themselves FACE TO FACE with another HUMVEE

Kenny panics trying to scramble away but Danny pulls him
back

DANNY
Hold on I think it’s empty

As Danny slowly creeps along the side of the Humvee the
sound of a RADIO becomes audible Some sort of NEWSCAST

NEWSCASTER (0S)
-getting confirmation now that
the virus apparently spread after
several contractors hired to secure
the area became infected
themselves

Danny opens the door of the Humvee jumping as the BODY of a
soldier spills out onto the road

NEWSCASTER (OS) (CONTD)
In response the President has
ordered that the quarantine be
expanded by a hundred miles in
every direction

Flies crawl about on the man’s face which is covered with
RED LESIONS

NEWSCASTER (OS) (CONTD)
Additional troops have been
deployed to help with security in
the affected areas which are
already experiencing widespread
power failures and looting

Danny reaches into the truck and shuts off the radio

KENNY
So What now

They look at each other for a moment then Danny shrugs--

DANNY
We go back to town Bury our
dead See who else made it
Then head over to one of the
islands or something Someplace
easy to defend

INT HUMVEE - MOMENTS LATER
Danny sits behind the steering wheel trying to start the
Humvee At first it doesn’t sound like the engine’s going to

turn over-- but then it does suddenly ROARING to life

He looks over at Sarah who sits across from him inspecting
a pair of MACHINE GUNS

SARAH
Let’s do it

Danny puts the Humvee in gear and hits the gas
They drive in silence for a beat

KENNY PANS THE CAMERA so that we’re looking outside at the
TREES RUSHING BY--

KENNY (0S)
You guys think this is the
apocalypse

He points the camera back toward Danny and Sarah

DANNY
I think you’re the apocalypse

Sarah smiles SLAPS a fresh clip into one of the guns

SARAH
Your mom’s the apocalypse

HARD CUT TO BLACK as the humvee races toward the rising sun

ROLL CREDITS

EXT WOODS - MORNING (EPILOGUE)
THE CAMERA is tied to DOZENS of HELIUM BALLOONS

DANNY (0S)
There’s a strong wind blowing east
today

As it SLOWLY PANS AROUND we see a bunch of KIDS out in the
woods setting up camp

DANNY (0S) (CONT’D)
According to Kenny this
contraption’s probably gonna come
down a couple of states over

We see KENNY and PETE cooking breakfast for everyone

DANNY (CONTD)

So For all of you who are out
there going about your daily lives
as though what’s happening here
doesn’t affect you this is your
wake up call Now you know the
truth And you’ve got no excuse to
just stand by and let it happen

We see another group of TEENS gathered around SARAH watching
with rapt attention as she demonstrates how to break down a
MACHINE GUN

DANNY (0S) (CONTD)
We don’t want to hurt anyone We
don’t want to see this thing spread
any more than you do

Finally we come to rest on DANNY holding the camera in his
hand as he looks into the lens

DANNY (CONTD)
But if the only choice we’re given
is to either fight or die We
choose to fight Every time

(then)
That’s my message to you What you
do with it is up to you

And with that Danny releases the camera
It quickly TAKES FLIGHT rising up away from him-- the camp

growing smaller and smaller until finally it disappears
completely into the woods
