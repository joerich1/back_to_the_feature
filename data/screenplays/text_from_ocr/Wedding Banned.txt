ELAINE

Let me get this straight Mr
Quigg you see the police the
guardians of peace and safety in
our community forcibly enter your
domicile

(holding up pictures) 7
-»» however filthy it might be
and identify themselves At that
moment one could say you had a
choice You could stay still and
raise your hands above your head
which would seem to logically be
what a law-abiding citizen might
do or you could do what you chose
to do run out the back door like
a crazy person hop a fence get
bitten by your neighbor’s dog
leave a trail of blood to your
cousin’s equally-filthy house
where the very same officers find
you in the middle of shaving off
your truly-disgusting beard to hide
your identity

We see the defendant now has HALF-A-BEARD with one side of
his face clean-shaven and the other with hair

DEFENDANT
No I just wanted to look good for
my mug shot I was going to turn
myself in right after I swear

ELAINE
In my capacity as the arbiter of
your fate in this courtroom I’m
sitting here seriously trying to
determine exactly how stupid are
you

DEFENDANT
I went to college technical
college but still --

ELAINE
I’m done with you
(turning to cop)
Now Detective Hardesty I pose the
same question to you

HARDESTY
I think the defendant is very
stupid your honor

ELAINE —
Thank you Detective I agree but I
think the real prize for idiocy
actually goes to you today What
possibly makes you think you could
get away with entering into a
suspect’s house without a search
warrant and still make the charges
stick

HARDESTY
Your honor we had an excellent tip
and I mean look at the evidence
The guy had laptops and digital
cameras stacked to the ceiling

ELAINE
And none of it is admissable due to
the fact that you didn’t follow a
Simple procedure that anyone who
has seen an episode of “Law and
Order” would know he needed to do

DEFENDANT
I love that show
(making Law and Order sound)
Bong-Bong

ELAINE
Shut it Mr Quigg Now in the
absence of any admissible evidence
I have no choice but todismiss the
charges

HARDESTY
Your honor you can’t be serious --

ELAINE
You performed an illegal search
Detective You have no one to
blame but yourself You’re free to
go Mr Quigg And Detective rest
assured I will be passing along the
details of this debacle to your
superiors for disciplinary action

She bangs her gavel Pissed Hardesty starts to exit the
courtroom with another DETECTIVE

How is it that our daughter falls
in love and you make it all about
you

TRUDY
Sweetheart don’t let her get you
all worked up

ELAINE
You tell that mousy little
girlfriend of yours to go back to
her birding and guilting and all
her other annoying “ings” and mind
her own damn business

I’m done with this conversation
but you can feel free to continue
without me on the line Good

John hangs up The phone rings immediately again John —

turns off the ringer

INT JOHN’S HOUSE - MORNING

walks by the phone and turns on the ringer It rings
immediately He picks it up

ELAINE
Our daughter’s marrying the
Antichrist And I’m not talking
figuratively I think he has Zoe
under some spell We might need to
perform an exorcism to get this
beast out of her We cannot let
this wedding happen You have to
take back your permission

JOHN
This isn’t the 1800s They don’t
need our permission I trust our
smart capable daughter to make her
own choice

ELAINE
Even if that choice is a total
repudiation of everything I hold
dear

JOHN
Well if you think Zoe’s rebelling
against you now just wait until
you tell her she can’t marry this
guy she’ll never give him up

ELAINE
I just want her to see she’s making
a huge mistake It’s puppy love
And not the puppy love we had when
we first met more like she-found-a-
one-eyed-half-retarded-three-legged-
puppy-and-took-pity-on-it-love

JOHN
Then my advice to you -- which we
all know will be impossible -- is

to hold your tongue and wait it
out The wedding isn’t for another
few weeks so if the guy is as bad
as you say then our little girl is
smart enough to realize that and
she’ll come to her senses before
the big day

ELAINE
You think so

JOHN
Like I said I trust her

INT ZOE’S APARTMENT —- DAY
Zoe is trying on the ring as she and Cyrus lay on the couch

Maybe I should talk to her Take
her out for a spa day

ZOE
(sitting up serious)
I appreciate it but honestly
that’s a really bad idea

CYRUS
I just think it would help if she
knew me better I’m usually pretty
good with moms--

ZOE

My mom’s not like other moms I
know you want her to like you but
you have to trust me it’ll only
make things worse The only thing
that’s going to work with her is to
let time pass and eventually she’ll
come to love you like I do So
promise me you won’t go talk to

her
CYRUS
Okay I promise
(beat)
Can I send her a link to my MySpace
pages

was supposed to be up there for
like five years But I said to my
commanding officer Patrick
Stewart I had to be back in Pound
Ridge And he said why And I
Said because there is nothing more
important than your children So
he put the thing in full throttle
and I was there the moment Cyrus
popped out Yeah the Shuttle went
back up and on to do great things
without me but I got to be with
my family and what could be better
than that Which is why I’m so

Suddenly a man’s body goes flying through the frame and
lands with a thud We pull back to reveal a makeshift
wrestling ring and the guy who just flew through the frame
is Cyrus in a homemade wrestling outfit Bert in his own
homemade wrestling outfit stands over Cyrus in the ring We
see lots of guys with beers in their hands they’re going
nuts and cheering lLee’s voice comes over a crappy PA
system

LEE (ON PA)
Oh Cyrus the Virus just got
flapjacked by the Bonesnapper

We now pan over to John whose mouth hangs open at the
spectacle

Bert takes a lap of the ring with his hands raised Just
then Cyrus “surprises” Bert with a countering move that stuns
him The crowd erupts Cyrus does a few moves including a
Polish Hammer and a Gorilla Slam that sends Bert over the
ropes out of the ring and landing on John

CYRUS
Behold “BonesnapperBert” has
finally had his own bones snapped
and a new champion rises tonight

Cyrus jumps up on the turnbuckle and the crowd cheers

WOMANS VOICE (ON PA)
Why don’t you pick on someone your
own size

Suddenly some weak spotlights turn to illuminate dry ice-
induced smoke rising in front of a screen door at the back of
the house There in the doorway appear FOUR HOT WOMEN IN
DAISY DUKES AND TIGER-STRIPED BIKINI TOPS

CYRUS
Oh no you guys didn’t

The women enter the ring and surround Cyrus They growl and
make motions like cats with claws Cyrus throws a few of
them around They throw him around Finally Cyrus is
brought down by all the women That’s when one of them
we’ll call her THE ONE WITH THE BIGGEST BOOBS (because well
they’re huge) climbs on top and wraps her long legs around a
Cyrus’ throat Her crotch is inches from Cyrus’s face

THE ONE WITH THE BIGGEST BOOBS
We love taking on big boys like

to pounce with our mouths open real
wide take a bite and see if we
can choke down all that meat

I always thought these two would
get married some day dating as
long as they did

John gives Lee a confused look

THE ONE WITH THE BIGGEST BOOBS

CYRUS
No but you know I could be your
boy bitch

Suddenly something comes flying off the roof of the house
does a flip and lands in the ring It’s someone wearing a
freakish wrestling outfit and leather S and M mask with zipper
mouth The Freak is now on the canvas doing flips and
“preening like a monkey on amphetamines as he challenges the
women

LEE

Sunshine when a man and woman

ELAINE
We think this relationship with
Cyrus is a mistake and marrying him
will ruin your life forever

ZOE
Excuse me

JOHN
What your mother is so ineloquently
saying is that we just think that
you’ve only known each other a
short time and these feelings you
have could fade for either one of
you

ZOE
You’re really trying to talk me out
of marrying Cyrus hours before my
wedding

ELAINE

from the day I met him but like an

HARDESTY

(on screen)
Possible charges against the
Fischers could include kidnapping
wrongful imprisonment and
narcotics charges stemming from the
possible drugging of their
daughter

JOHN
Accidental drugging Technically
she did it to herself

HARDESTY

I’ve already obtained a warrant

(holds it up smugly)
- to search Judge Fischer’s home
and a similar legal search is being
conducted by local police at the
home of her ex-husband The
Fischers are fugitives from justice
and we will use every means
available to us to hunt them down
and bring the full force of the law
to bear upon them

INT MERCEDES — A FEW SECONDS LATER

can’t believe they’re talking about
real charges and real crimes They

I really tore him up in my
courtroom

JOHN
Of course you did

ELAINE
He deserved it And for the
record the lecture worked because
he did make sure to get a warrant
this time So as far as I’m
concerned I’m vindicated here

JOHN
See this is what you get when you
don’t care about being liked You
get people hating you

ELAINE
Look that’s not what’s important
right now What’s important is
that we can’t go to your place
anymore we need to find
somewhere else to go

Suddenly they pass a sign on the highway that flashes

taking college prep courses was
better --

And those courses got you into
Cornell And did I stop you from
doing theater in college

ZOE
No but you wouldn’t let me get a
Masters in it You pushed and
pushed for me to go to law school
Now I’m a lawyer and I work sixty-
