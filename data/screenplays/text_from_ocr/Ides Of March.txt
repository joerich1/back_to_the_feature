sound of feedback getting louder until it stops

We hear the director speak over the loud speaker

DIRECTOR

are busy working No one pays any attention to him as he
stands there This isnt awkward for Stephen THIS IS

on a riser as we agreed to in the
pre-conditions Youre a few
inches short and it makes it harder
for the Governor to read his notes

STAGE MANAGER

trouble reading his notes Why

CUT TO
EXT MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - DAY

ROB BRAUN a local Cincinnati anchor talks to camera as we
see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building Under this we hear
Rachel Maddow reporting

RACHEL MADDOW (0C)
Well it all comes down to thisWe
are one week away from the Ohio
primary

Camera now moves past ROB to another news truck where an
MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go
live There is a monitor in front of him

The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW
does the lead in

As RACHELs audio continues we see the following images
CUT TO
EXT MIDDLE AMERICA

We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat gray
desolate In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white-
and-blue letters painted on the side They read OHIO FOR
MORRIS

RACHEL MADDOW (0S)
Two democrats are left standing
Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is
trailing Governor Morris from
Pennsylvania

Moments later we roll past another farm with a large
billboard staked into the ground beside the road PULLMAN -
AMERICAS FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th

EXT SUBURBAN STREET

We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold -

knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood Yard signs for
both candidates line the street

( )

RACHEL MADDOW (0S)
Governor Morris has mounted a
sizable lead with 2047 delegates
winning New Hampshire California
New York and MichiganBut Senator
Pullman with 1302 delegates is
still in the hunt having won
Florida Tennessee Virginia and
Missouri

EXT CITY INTERSECTION

Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars
HONK FOR MORRIS A passing car lays on the horn and the
supporters cheer

RACHEL MADDOW (0S)
A win in Ohio could turn it all
around for the Arkansas Senator

CLOSE UP of a Pullman bumper sticker on an SUV at a
stoplight right next to a My Child is an Honor Student
decal

RACHEL MADDOW (0S) (CONTâ€™D)
So one week from Tuesday the all
important hundred and eighty one
Ohio delegates could be the
deciding factor

EXT HARDWARE STORE
A clerk placing a Morris sign in the store window In the
shop next door various TVs are in a window display We see
RACHEL MADDOWS report on them
RACHEL MADDOW (0S)

And once again the old adage is

trueAs goes Ohio so goes the

Nation

RAPID RESPONSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

MOLLY enters and we follow her through the campaign war room
its the size of a coffin jammed to the hilt with twenty-
something staffers manning laptops

Were in the hustle and bustle of a live telecast

multiple angles of the telecast

SENATOR PULLMAN
Would you call yourself a
Christian

GOV MORRIS
How would that matter

SENATOR PULLMAN
(Reading)
I have no idea what happens when
we die maybe nothingmaybe it
was like before we were born You
did write this Governor

GOV MORRIS
Then let me try and clarifyI was
raised Catholic I am not a
practicing CatholicI have no
idea what happens when you die and
if the Senator does then perhaps
he should be President I11l even
vote for him

The audience laughs

SENATOR PULLMAN
Is that your idea of being
specific

MOLLY passes out coffee

CUT TO

INT MIAMI UNIVERSITY - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Were now

live inside the debate

We see

( )

GOV MORRIS
Let me be more specific I am
neither a Christian nor an
atheist Im not Jewish or
Muslimwhat I believemy
religion is written on a piece of
parchment called the Constitution
Meaning I will defend till my
dying breath your right to
worship in whatever God or lack
thereof you believe in as long as
it doesnt hurt others I believe
we should be judged as a government
by how we take care of those who
cant take care of themselves
Thats my religion If you feel
that Im not religious enough then
dont vote for me If you feel Im
not experienced enough or tall
enough then dont vote for me
Because Im not going to change
those to get elected

SENATOR PULLMAN
I just wanted you to say out loud
if you believed in the teachings of
the Bible

GOV MORRIS
Is this a Democratic primary or a
general election

People laugh

SENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR)
Well Governor whoever wins this
contest will be running for
Presidentand if you dont think
that these questions wont be
central in a general election then
you are living in fantasy land I
applaud your honesty Governor I
doIm simply pointing to what is
obviouswe are running for
President of the United
Statesnot for student council
president

INT MIAMI UNIVERSITY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign -
is also watching from the wings Duffys smooth calculated
and icy He walks over to Stephen and Paul

DUFFY

jackasses before

DUFFY
(to Stephen)

Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on

horseman to rig the ballot boxes

surprise me Dont get me wrong
Six presidentials Ive done and

chance In the last thirty years
seventy-three Democrats have run
for president How many have won

( )

PAUL (CONTD)
That means seventy guys ran who
thought they had a chance and they
all lost

IDA

chance you wont win

PAUL
Dont twist my words What Im
saying is that Im not going to
promise well win But hes
decorated by Bush Senior from the
first Gulf war and protested the
second He left his state with a
balanced budget and the fourth
highest education rate The
Republicans have nobody out there
that can touch this guyso for

judge someone until Ive walked in
their shoes

CHARLIE ROSE
But youre against the death
penalty

GOV MORRIS
Yes Because of what it says about
us as a society

CHARLIE ROSE
Suppose Governor it was your
wife

GOV MORRIS
And she was murdered what would I
do

CHARLIE ROSE

It gets more complicated when its
personal

( )

GOV MORRIS
Surewell if I could get to him
Id find a way to kill him
CHARLIE ROSE
So you you Governor would impose
the death penalty
GOV MORRIS
No I would commit a crime for
which I would happily go to jail
CHARLIE ROSE
Then why not let society do that
GOV MORRIS
Because society has to be better
than the individual If I were to
do that I would be wrong
CHARLIE ROSE
And what about guns
GOV MORRIS
Isnt it time for a commercial
They laugh
CHARLIE ROSE
This is public TV we dont have
commercials
GOV MORRIS
Thats unfortunate

INT PERFORMING ARTS BUILDING - DAYTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE -
A BIT LATER

A few hundred students sit around The GOVERNOR in a theater
as he fields questions

MORRIS is cornered by a conservative student

STUDENT 1
Gay marriage

GOV MORRIS
Its a silly argument

STUDENT 1
Not to fifty percent of Americans

GOV MORRIS
Over the age of fifty

STUDENT 1
Thats who votesthats who shows
up at the polls

GOV MORRIS
Well thats changingand
hopefully the way we frame the
argument is

At this point the camera travels backstage to find STEPHEN
BEN PAUL and MOLLY working the phones and laptops

( )

PAUL
(To Stephen)
Keep an eye on the Governor

STEPHEN
(To BEN)
Let me know how its going out
there

STEPHEN (CONTâ€™D)
Im on it

BEN takes us back out and under this we hear the GOVERNOR
continue debating

STUDENT 1
Froma religiousa

GOV MORRIS
From a religious to a civil rights
issue

STUDENT 1
But one could argue a great
difference between gender and race

GOV MORRIS
Not really They used to ban
interracial marriagewomen
couldnt votethe list goes on

STUDENT 1
The argument of course-

We hear boos from students in the audience
At this point the camera finds MORRIS
Morris quiets the students

GOV MORRIS
Now wait she has a point to
make

STUDENT 1
The argument is that men and women
can in fact be separate but equal
races cannot

GOV MORRIS
How so

( )

STUDENT 1
You have separate public bathrooms
for men and women but it would be
illegal to have separate bathrooms
for two races

GOV MORRIS
Now

STUDENT 1
(Laughing)
Yes now

Audience laughs

INT MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVENS ROOM - NIGHT

Were tight on a TV Its the taped broadcast of the previous
town hall meeting As the scene plays we pull back to see
STEPHEN and MOLLY making love We see pieces of body parts
Handsa leghair being pulledits what weve grown
used to seeing in a seventies love scene all lit by the
flickering of a television The only score we hear is the
sound of the TV

GOV MORRIS
See were framing the argument
based on the idea that
homosexuality is a choice you
choose to be gay not that you were
born that way like being born
black Because if you start the
discussion with the idea that gay
is not a life choice but part of
your DNA then gay marriage is and
can only be a civil rights issue

ANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone

STUDENT 2
Do you think candor is your appeal
Is that what youre running on as
much as your platform

GOV MORRIS
Well see Itll drive them to the
polls one way or the other

But why Why would you do that to
me Why would you do that to the

campaign
PAUL

The campaign will survive
STEPHEN

Then why would you do that to me
PAUL

Makes it easier to let you go
STEPHEN

What
PAUL

Whyd you meet with Duffy
STEPHEN

I made a mistake - a stupid

mistake

( )

PAUL
No Stephen You didnt make a
mistake You made a choice You
called me and left a message to
call backthat it was important
But when I didyou said to forget
about it You chose not to tell
me Why did you make that choice

STEPHEN
I didnt think it was important

PAUL
Sure you did But you went because
you were curious because you were
flattered Because it made you feel
special to think Duffy wanted to
speak to you instead of me Because
you thought to yourself maybe I
can get something out of this
Because it made you feel big
First campaign I ran tiny little
race in Kentucky -state senate
seat Workin for redneck nobody
named McGuthrie Had no money no
staff no fuckin office Everyone
thought we didnt stand a chance
Theres no way we can compete And
about this time a guy running a
congressional campaign a few
districts over gives me a call
Says I really like what you were
able to do for poor ole Sam But
lets face it hes a goner so why
dont you come work for me What
do I do Well Stephen -this is
where you and I are different I
told Sam about the call And Sam
says to me Paul you think this
others guys got a shot at
winning and he can pay you more
than anything I can afford so if
its what you feel you need to do
then I wont get in your way So I
say Sam -you took a chance and
hired me when I was even more of
nobody than you are and Id be
damned if Im gonna jump ship just
because the shit hit the fan
We lost the race but three years
later when Sam decided to run for
Governor -who do you think he
called We won that race

(MORE )

( )

PAUL (CONTD)
And twenty years later Im where I
am now (Beat) Theres only one
thing I value in this world Steve
and thats loyalty Without it
youre nothing and you have no one
And in politics its the only
currency that you can count on
Thats why Im letting you go Not
because youre not good enough But
I value trust over skill And I
dont trust you anymore

STEPHEN
Well it really isnt whether you
trust me its whether the Governor
does

PAUL
The Governor knows he thinks its
the right thing to do

STEPHEN
He does

PAUL
If I were you Id get a good night
sleep because youre gonna get
fucking pounded by calls from the
press in the morning

EXT XAVIER UNIVERSITY - CINCINNATI

Under the following we hear the Governors speech

We see Satellite trucks press vehicles police cars etc

At a catering truck we see a pair of hands grab some coffee
and cookies This is another young intern JILL

We follow her across the street and into a door
INT XAVIER HALLWAYS and RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
JILL comes through the door

We follow her through the hallways crowded with television
cables and technicians She makes her way in to a large
reception room where Stephen is watching Governor Morris
give his speech She hands him a coffee

We cut between The Governor and Stephen watching from the
back

GOV MORRIS
Thank you Senator Thompson Well
the polls arent quite closed but
I want to congratulate Senator
PullmanAnd his Republican
constituents on their win here in
Ohio

The room explodes in laughter and applause

GOV MORRIS (CONTD)
Senator Thompson I am honored to
stand here today with you I am
humbled by your kind words thank
you Ladies and gentlemen today
marks the beginning of a fight
between two sets of ideals Either
were going to move forward or were
going to live in the past
Either were going to lead the
world in technology or we are
going to bury our heads in the
sand the sands of Saudi
Arabiathe sands of Iraq Either
were going to let greed and
corruption ruin our industries and
our shorelines or we are going to
take back our country We are not a
nation used to coming in second or
third

Cheers

CUT TO

INT XAVIER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY and STAGING ROOM

While the Governors speech continues we stay close on
Stephen as he walks through the crowd We follow him into
Governor Morriss staging area

Four monitors on a table show different network feeds We
watch Stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt He
ties his tie and puts his jacket on From the monitors we
hear reporters etc

We push in on one of the monitors where DUFFY is being
interviewed As we push in we see STEPHEN cross out of the
room BEN is watching he looks back and smiles at STEPHEN

DUFFY
No its not decisive we still have
several contests and those states
are going to want to have their
say It does look like well win
Ohio

RACHEL MADDOW
But you must concede that these
three hundred and fifty-six
delegates put the pledged delegates
out of reach And with word today
that the super delegates are
breaking three to one for Morris

DUFFY
We still have a lot of contests
Rachel Ohio is-

RACHEL MADDOW

INT XAVIER UNIVERSITY - GYMNASIUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A wide shot of the darkened gymnasium Stephen sits on a
stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light

Were now in tight - One PERSON is putting a mic on Stephen
while the OTHER is applying make-up

No one speaks
The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear
SOUND MAN
You should be able to hear

themdo you hear them

We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New
York

STEPHEN
Yeah I can hear them

SOUND MAN
Good quick mic check can you count
to ten for me

Stephen counts to ten Everyone stands behind the camera
The sound man with his headset on whispers

SOUND MAN (CONTD)
Theyre coming to you in about
forty five seconds
We sit in silence staring at Stephens face
Ten seconds - nothing

Twenty seconds - nothing

This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium
- only a few people doing their individual jobs

Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell
phones

( )

The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset
The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments
A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance

They all seem to be staring at him They probably arent -
but he feels it The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen
has given over to emptiness The price of winning at all
cost

We stay on Stephens face
We now hear the Governors speech through Stephens earwig

GOV MORRIS
Senator Thompson I am proud that
you have brought integrity back to
this election Because thats what
this comes down to integrity Who
we are Because how we project
ourselves to the rest of the world
mattersDignity

future depends on it

Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN

SOUND MAN
Coming to you in

Through the earwig we hear an JOHN KING

JOHN KING
We now have Governor Morriss new
senior campaign advisor Stephen
Myers coming to us from Xavier
University where Senator Thompson
has just endorsed Governor Morris
