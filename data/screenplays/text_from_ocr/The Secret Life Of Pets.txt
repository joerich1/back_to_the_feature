INT SEWERS - DAY 42

Max and Duke follow behind Snowball as the bunny and his
posse make their way down through the winding twisting sewer
tunnels leading ever further underground

Max looks around taking in the dark tunnels full of the
city’s rotting discarded detritus Passing chunks of trash
and molding fish bones Max recoils as the stench hits him

MAX
Ugh smell is disgusting
(off Snowball’s look)
---ly good this is all so great
Love it here

Snowball stops in front of a A SET OF BARS which lead into
another tunnel Suddenly the iron bars begin to SLITHER and
HISS The bars were actually SNAKES They hiss in unison

The snakes’ eyes turn green and they move aside allowing
entry Snowball perks up Max and Duke look even more
nervous

SNOWBALL (CONTD)
Follow me

Up ahead Snowball comes to a sudden stop up just as the
sewer tunnel opens up into a vast cavern like room With
water running through it and bits of refracted light coming
from small cracks in the concrete and strange bits of moss
and vegetation growing it feels like some kind of
subterranean jungle - a bizarre world within a world
The Secret Life of Pets 41

Leading them into the “jungle”

SNOWBALL (CONTD)

front of Max and Duke

Max and Duke stare into the pipe terrified

SNOWBALL
As proof of your allegiance you
will now receive the bite of a one
fanged half-blind viper fueled by
a diet of anti- human RAGE

Just then an ENORMOUS MUTANT VIPER slithers out from a pipe
and HISSES The Viper OPENS his mouth Max and Duke stare at
his sharp fang

Max follows the sound of Duke’s voice and SLAMS into his
body

DUKE

Duke steps out of the way revealing that the tunnel has led
them to a HUGE DROP A HUNDRED FEET below them a RUSHING
SUBTERRANEAN RIVER of SEWAGE flows by

Max turns around The Flushed Pets turn a corner popping
into view They’re running at Max and Duke baring their
