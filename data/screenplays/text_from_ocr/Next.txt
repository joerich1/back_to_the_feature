BARE WHITE ROOM

Thirty feet square CRIS JOHNSON wearing a jail uniform
sits in a HEAVY CHAIR that is bolted to the floor Mid-
twenties jaded rebellious handsome as a statue Cris
radiates a serene if somewhat scruffy charisma

He faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on a bare wall To the left
of the screen an unframed MIRROR to the right a DIGITAL
CLOCK-CALENDAR

A WOMANS FACE appears on the plasma screen CALLIE FERRIS
Thirty Tailored Angular Kate Hepburn-ish

Ferris on monitor
Mr Johnson youve been sent to us
by the state authorities for
testing We want to determine if
theres any substance to your
claims

Cris
Fire away

FERRIS ON MONITOR
If we can verify your ability we
may be able to help you avoid a
criminal trial

And we is

Ferris ON MONITOR
Homeland Security

Ferris face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of
random video clips Hang-gliding Traffic jam Volcano
erupting
Ferris ON MONITOR
Now if you would please look at
the monitor and tell us what you
see say five minutes from now

Cris looks at the clock 1632 March 9 2006 He squints
and the clock speeds up a little

Ferris (oc)
Are you there yet

In a few seconds the clock reads 1637

On the monitor Ferris image has been replaced by footage
surfers riding big waves in Hawaii

Cris
Surfers

Ferris (oc)
Good Now can you move ahead ten

minutes

Varied images fast forward on the plasma screen He arrives
at 1647 and reports on what he sees

cris
Ants crawling up a tree

Ferris (oc)
Excellent Can you get to 1900
hours
Cris looks ahead and squints

CLOCK

Minutes whiz by
PLASMA SCREEN

Clips play and change almost too fast to be recognized
Clock

Cris gets to 1900 -- and keeps going

Mirror

Cris has a five oclock shadow

Clock

Hours tick off like an accelerating metronome

Mirror

Cris sports a three-day stubble He struggles to get out of
the chair but he is now strapped into it bound at the

wrist

and ankle His face fills with rage

Plasma screen

The evening news zips by Talking heads Reportage

Mirror

Like a window into a time machine Cris beard lengthens He
grows pale His clothes change every few seconds Rage gives
way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train

Plasma screen

The news dissolves into a blur

Mirror

Cris ages before his own eyes Wrinkles etch into skin Hair
greys recedes Outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as Cris

watches himself waste away

Womans voice

Cris tired old eyes look up confused
INT VEGAS HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A perky young WAITRESS stands over him holding a pot of
coffee

WAITRESS
Warm-up

On cris
Young again

CRIS
Just the check

She sets it on the table with a flirtatious smile He takes
it to the register and pays cash

Cris (VO)
The future aint what it used to
be Ever hear that expression

A moment later A SECOND CRIS follows the first Cris to the
register repeating his every movement

CRIS (VO)
Its a joke but its true The
future changes every time you look
at it Because you looked at it

As Cris 2 pays cash Cris 1 proceeds into the casino

CRIS (VO)
Cause once you see it youre
different

Cris 2 follows literally walking in Cris 1s footsteps

CRIS (VO)
Maybe just a little

A DRUNK bumps into Cris 1 and spills his Daiquiri on him

CRIS (VO)
And that changes everything else
else

Cris 2 -- the real Cris -- follows a moment later and
sidesteps the Drunk who spills his Daiquiri on someone

CRIS (VO)
Its got something to do with
quantum physics

Cris 2 reaches the gaming tables and merges with Cris 1

Cris (VO)
Thats why I stay away from
roulette and craps It only takes a
millionth of an ounce to change a
roll Just placing a different bet
can throw things off

A roulette ball skitters indecisively between two grooves
before settling into one of them

CRIS (v0)
Ive got other rules too I dont
play against people like at poker
Only against the house

Slot machines Horse racing Sports games

CRIS (vo)
And my goal isnt to win big At
least not any more The idea is to
go unnoticed so I can keep coming
back to the trough

He passes the MILLION DOLLAR SLOT Stops like its calling
out to him

CRIS (vo)
So no jackpots No longshots No
big bets except when I want â€˜em to
see me lose

Cris notices a DESPERATE GAMBLER on the verge of tears
Clearly hes dropped a bundle Cris approaches him and
points to the MILLION DOLLAR SLOT

CRIS
Try that one man Ive got a
deuce

feeling
Gambler
(suspicious)

Then you play it

CRIS
Against my religion

Cris offers the guy a handful of silver dollars

CRIS
Do it quick before somebody else
gets there

While the Gambler dawdles a MIDWESTERN DOWAGER plants
herself at the MEGA-SLOT and starts feeding it dollars

Cris sighs and walks off
The Gambler watches him go then reacts to BELLS FLASHING
LIGHTS and SHRIEKS OF CELEBRATION The Dowager has hit the
MEGA- JACKPOT
Blackjack section
Cris takes a stool at a crowded table
CRIS (VO)
Mainly I stick to blackjack Boring
but controllable
Cris antes up Cards are dealt Hes got a four showing
Taking a hit he goes bust with a jack So in real time he
sticks
CRIS (VO)

And safe unless they think youre
counting

The dealer turns over his cards Hes got a king and a
So he has to draw Pulls the jack Busted
The dealer pays Cris then presses a button under the table

INT SURVEILLANCE ROOM
Banks of video monitors display images from the multitude
cameras looking down from above the gaming tables The

a red light so he can look over a Surveillance Operators

INT CASINOBLACKJACK TABLE - DAY

As Cris signals for another card TWO BLACK SUITS appear
behind him

Cris takes in their grim faces Turns to see two more pairs
of goons stationed nearby

The COCKTAIL WAITRESS approaches to take Cris order

SUITS reach his stool but this time its empty They look
around One of them whispers into his mike The three pairs
of goons get instructions and split up

Tracking shot eye level

Cris strides crisply through the casino Sees another PAIR
BLACK SUITS scanning for him He ducks into the maze of
slots Zigs and zags from aisle to aisle seemingly at
random A moment after each turn a Black Suit appears
behind or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris
Tracking shot high angle
A clearer perspective as TWO BLACK SUITS approach Cris
from different directions Cris has no way to see them or
know theyre coming but at the last moment he MOVES in

between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they
pass

surveillance room
Davis and Hawkeye wince as the Black Suits keep missing
quarry

davis
Whats wrong with you guys

hawkeye
Hes right next to you Aisle 63

Ferris watches the chase fascinated
Phalanxes of slot machines

Black Suits converge from various directions in that fake-
calm fast-walk

Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby then
heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted

except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself blocking
the Black Suits view
aisle

The Black Suit moves on Cris shifts to another spot just as
a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the

This time THREE FRAT BOYS change machines and obscure Cris
from his gaze

Davis is throwing a fit
Davis

Cris slips away in the shadow of the Frat Boys

hawkeye
Maybe hes on our frequency

DAVIS
I dont see an earphone on him

hawkeye
Hes heading to the Convention
Annex
FERRIS
(stands)
Give me a headset Im going down
there

Convention annex

Arriving at the foyer Cris sees Five Meeting Rooms He
squints then decisively enters one of them

FOUR BLACK SUITS arrive an instant later Without wasting a
beat each of them goes through a different door All except

the one Cris went through

Cris re-emerges a moment later and heads back toward the
casino

Cris sees her Recognizes her from his prevision as the
on the plasma screen Turns and walks away
She sees Cris Takes off after him

Ferris

Hes heading toward

the Ipanema Grill

Security Staff converge on the area Cris is in plain sight
Suddenly a busload of tourists surge in through a door and
clog the way

Cris continues into the

Kitchen area

Passing a room service cart he rolls it in front of him A
few steps on he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart
and pours some in front of one random closed door Cris then
shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty
intersecting corridor A Black Suit barrels into the empty
intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it
Behind Cris a door swings open a Black Suit charges out
steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and
falls on his ass

Cris slips by him but gets cut off by an arriving group of
FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS Big guys They try to grab him He
evades their grasp almost magically and like a Shaolin

somehow leverages them into each other until they are ina
pile on the floor Cris darts around them into the

Lobby

He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery
Rolling it to the left a Black Suit on that side doesnt

him - and moves on Cris switches to the right side of the
card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him

Abandoning the cart Cris sets off across the lobby ina
and

through

tailgate

several

herky-jerky rhythm

He walks four quick steps without being seen Then stops
behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way When
Black Suit 1 looks on Cris resumes his journey cutting
across the lobby at an acute angle In this way he avoids
being seen by Black Suit 2 Cris now backs up three steps

avoids being seen by Black Suit 3

By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his
hunters will be looking Cris achieves something like
invisibility

The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris She sees him He
makes a run for the door She dashes after him

FERRIS
You I just need to talk to you

Cris grabs a guests suitcase and keeps moving

FERRIS
Homeland Security

The guest chases after Cris - and collides with Ferris
knocking her to the ground Which allows Cris to slip

a door to the
Ext Hotel loading dock - DAY

Where TWO LAUNDRY DELIVERY MEN are flinging sacks of clothes
into the back of a truck Cris steps toward the open

with a steady pace As if on cue both Laundry Guys turn and
bend to pick up another sack of clothes Cris walks right by
them without being noticed -- and climbs into the truck A
moment later the Laundry Guys pivot back around toss sacks
of clothes in after Cris and slam the rear doors They get
in the truck and drive off just as Ferris Davis and

Black Suits arrive to find a cold trail

relief

Behind the barricade Ferris helicopter comes in for a
landing

INT Ricks Police Cruiser - DAY

Cris checks his rearview mirror A six-pack of cop cars are
right behind him To his left a steep rock wall To his
right a vertical drop-off into the canyon

Cris drives on the blood draining from his face

FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

Ferris strides across the span Baines in her wake Arriving
at the barricade she approaches the biggest state police

car a HUMMER -- and flashes her badge

FERRIS
I need your vehicle

She walks through the Trooper and gets into his Hummer

BAINES

downhill explodes falls again this time crashing directly
onto boulders at the bottom

ON CRIS

He drives toward a specific segment of railing between two
light posts
THE BRIDGE

Ricks Cruiser crashes through the railing and plunges over
the side of the bridge

Liz runs to the rail and leans over the side watching the
Cruiser fall down down down through the narrow ravine

IN THE FALLING CAR
Cris unbuckles his seat belt Opens the door Just before

impact he LEAPS OUT away from the car

BOTTOM OF CANYON

The car smashes into boulders at the shallow side of the

river A moment later Cris SPLASHES a few yards away in the

deepest part of the rapids

ON THE BRIDGE

Ferris peers down into the canyon

IN THE RAPIDS

Cris bobs to the surface and is carried away by the fierce

current The smashed Cruiser also gets carried into the

river Fighting the current Cris watches as the smashed

police cruiser surges ahead of him - then disappears

Perplexed for a beat he suddenly understands and
desperately

swims for a rock and clambers onto it

CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Cris is stuck in the middle

of the river -- about five feet from where it drops off into

a WATERFALL

A HELICOPTER

flies over him

ON THE ROCK

Cris looks for a way out Seeing none he jumps

And is swallowed up in dark thunderous death
SnapBACK TO
CRIS
Still on the rock Looks up and sees a cable being lowered
from the helicopter He looks around Is there another way
out Out of choices he reaches for the cable Misses Loses
his balance Flails At the last second he steadies

himself

He wants to live
The cable dangles back into range
Cris grabs it

The cable is hooked to A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS

FERRIS

Watches through binoculars as Cris snaps one cuff around his
wrist -- and waits She shouts into her radio

FERRIS
Cuffs on both wrists Leave him if

he doesnt

HELICOPTER

Descends with Cris hanging below by a cable MPs are
waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around Cris then
tape him like a mummy up to his neck When hes bound as
securely as Hannibal Lecter Ferris steps close and gets her
first good look at him

Ferris
Cris Johnson we meet at last

CRIS
Why does everybody have amnesia but

FERRIS

I only ask one thing from you Give
me a chance to earn your trust

cris
I did and you failed

She seems genuinely surprised

FERRIS
Then give me another chance You

She signals and Cris is dumped into the waiting helicopter
The door is slammed behind him

INT helicopter - DAY

Inside Cris is surprised to find himself alone with Liz He
edges closer so they can hear each other

CRIS
Dont let them know youre
pregnant
The helicopter takes off
Cris
You dont have to raise him But at

that It might be the only chance

LIZ
I promise

They gaze at each other with intense longing
LIZ
Work with them Cris So we can be

Cris balances at the ready as the three rifles take aim at
him He LUNGES at the very instant that one rifle FIRES A
bullet ZINGS by his ear

As the second rifle fires Cris contorts -- and a bullet
parts his hair

As the third rifles fires he tumbles away almost a blur
More shots in rapid sequence erratic rhythm Two at a
Three at a time

Like a pinball Cris pivots crouches dodges every bullet
Then suddenly stops Stands there An easy target Click
click click the guns are out of bullets

FERRIS
Hes almost impossible to shoot

Wisdom takes out his handgun carefully aims and discharges
six shots at Cris - doesnt score a hit

Ferris shows the aiming gantries to Wisdom

FERRIS
No minds to read The guns are
aimed automatically by infrared

The floor is electrified He must
have tried resisting and foreseen
the result

Cris walks through the doorway into

THE SMALLER WHITE ROOM

which is familiar from the opening sequence but not exactly
the same Because its not exactly the same future A HEAVY
CHAIR bolted to the floor faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on
the wall To the left of the screen is a MIRROR to the
right a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR

Ferris FACE appears on the monitor
Ferris on monitor
Cris its time to get started with
the next test This wont be
unpleasant We just need to you sit
in the chair

Cris eyes the chair with suspicion

Ferris on monitor
want you to look ahead tell me
the time on the clock and then tell
me what film clip you see playing
Lets start with five minutes from
now Then well press ahead as far
as youre capable of
(to Wisdom)
The clips have been assembled at
random by a computer so nobody
nows whatll be playing next

Cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected - as
an old man He turns away

Wisdom looks at Ferris She shrugs sheepish

Ferris
Thats only because you wont
cooperate

CRIS
Because youre trying to force me

a hero Fight us and things will
get worse and worse

Cris squints frustrated looking for a way out

Cris hops and jumps in agony
Ferris turns away then makes herself look

Whoa you are one tough bitch

not mistaken

She turns off the juice

WISDOM
He knew hed get shocked but he
chose to resist

FERRIS
Hes almost never had to face
consequences

Cris are you ready to get in the

Cris recovering shoots her the finger

She switches the toggle again - and leaves it on Wisdom
doesnt have the stomach to watch

Cris collapses unconscious

FERRIS
Leave him there Well start again
when he recovers

INT Wisdoms office - DAY

Wisdom and Ferris are both traumatized by the torture

WISDOM
Okay how do we use him to find the
bombs

FERRIS

Simple We make him watch the news
and tell us about it

WISDOM
How far ahead can he see

FERRIS
I dont know But I suspect we can
increase his range with practice
Especially if we restrict his
future to only watching news Then
hell be like a timescope

Wisdom nods

WISDOM
You were right This is huge

FERRIS
This is just for starters You want
to stage a pre-emptive strike he
can tell you if youll hit the
target and whether they hit back
and what went wrong And you can do
this over and over until you get it
perfect before you begin

Wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential

wisDOM
And all hes ever done with it is a
little gambling and securities
fraud

FeRRIS
I know its amazing but hes not
ambitious

WiSDOM
Damn how will we control this guy
when he figures out what hes
capable of

Ferris
We control him now We just have to
keep it that way

WISDOM
Right now sweetheart we cant
even get him to sit in a chair

Dread suddenly washes over Wisdom

WISDOM
Weve got to think this through
Your friend could be more dangerous
than the terrorists

Ferris
Arent you running ahead of
yourself

WISDOM
With this guy you have to Or
itll be over before it begins

Ferris
So well keep him in chains

WISDOM
That may not be enough We may
have to cut off his arms and legs
Then I might start to feel safe

Ferris grins uncomfortably

Ferris
Youre not serious

WISDOM
Think about it What were talking
about here is the next step in
human evolution And Im not gonna
make the same mistake the

Neanderthals made when they ran
across this good-looking Homo
Sapien fellow and all the lady
Neanderthals said Hes so cute
Lets keep him around

FERRIS
Can we deal with your sexual
insecurities at another time

You mean after its too late
