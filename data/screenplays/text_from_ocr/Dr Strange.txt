STONEHENGE EXTERIOR NIGHT

Beneath a moon almost obscured by storm clouds
a silent procession of SIX MEN in hooded robes
slowly carries MERLIN - a frail elderly figure
also robed - towards the centre of

the STONE CIRCLE

TITLE THE SIXTH CENTURY
STONEHENGE
STONE CIRCLE EXTERIOR NIGHT

As the wind whips their robes about them

the MEN gently lay their dying burden on the

ground They are surrounded by a hexagonal arrangement
of large BRIGHTLY BURNING TORCHES

One hooded man ARKKIN kneels down beside
the ancient sorcerer

ARKKIN

You must not leave us Merlin
MERLIN

My time has come
ARKKIN

With you gone who will stand
against the darkness

MERLIN
You are my successor
I have trained you well

ARKKIN
But the one we fear is immortal
In time I too shall age
and die What then

MERLIN
Another will take your place
as you now take mine The
chain is eternal There is
always another

LIGHTNING BOLTS flash down The HOODED MEN
cover their eyes with their hoods

LICHTNING strikes a direct hit on the stone
where MERLIN lies consuming him in
electrical fire and breaking the stone asunder --
The lightning ends The MEN lift their hoods
turning to where MERLIN lay

Only a fading luminescence hangs over the
splintered rock MERLIN is gone Forever

NEW YORK CITY EXTERIOR DAY

and most of the island Only the tallest buildings
emerge into brilliant spring sunlight

TWO NEW SKYSCRAPERS dominate the skyline
Atop one is the word MORDO
Atop the other INDUSTRIES

Traffic is logjammed in all directions

Visibility is down to six blocks

ELECTRIC SIGNS repeat the words OZONE LEVEL CRITICAL

Homeless people wash windows fire-eat and panhandle
among the cars An ambulance is stuck in traffic
sirens blaring unable to move

Signs in the opulent store windows read
HAPPY 21ST CENTURY and ADIOS 1999

It is extremely hot

A VAST EXECUTVE HELICOPTER bursts out of the smog haze
and passes overhead

HELICOPTER INTERIOR DAY

BYRON MORDO sits in the back of his private chopper

FLATIRON BUILDING Security Men rush towards the bird
FLATIRON BUILDING INTERIOR DAY

MORDO cnters the lobby He is a head taller than everyone

NORLIN KANDELL ENTERPRISES

The MAN beside him continues coughing searching
MORDO hands him a PACK OF CIGARETTES

The MAN nods coughing tearing the pack open
BYRON MORDO smiles

KANDELL ENTERPRISES INTERIOR DAY
The tiny outer office is completely empty

save for a desk an answering machine and a
framed photograph of SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAIN PEAKS

MORDO pushes a button on the answering machine

to sit The inner office door slides open
KANDELLS OFFICE INTERIOR DAY

KANDELL sits behind his desk looking out of the window
His swivel chair is turned so that his back is to MORDO

MORDO arrogantly tosses his topcoat over the back
of a chair and sits down
KANDELL
Ive been expecting you Mordo

MORDO
You havent replied to my offer

KANDELL slowly swivels round to face MORDO
He is an ancient Asian man in a 3-piece tweed suit

KANDELL
It was an ulitmatum
I dont respond to ultimatums

MORDO
Youre leveraged out Kandell
-I can acquire you any time I want
(KANDELL nods staring at MORDO
MORDO becomes uncomfortable)
My Client is in a growth mode
He needs this territory to expand
into Dont be a fool --

KANE
When is this merger due Mordo

MORDO shakes his head

MORDO
I wont play games Im here to ease
you out or take you on board
The choice is yours

KANDELL lifts a glass of water to his lips
He drinks

MORDO
Damn it old man Take the
easy path Isnt that what
you used to tell your students

KANDELL lowers the glass He gazes intently at MORDO
KANDELL

Im on the easy rath Mordo

Youre the one whos chosen to

live difficultly

The glass on the table shatters

MORDO
(rising)
The Takeover is going ahead
With or without you

KANDELL

MORDO emerges and heads for his helicopter
Security Men open the door for him

Beside the building a huge CONSTRUCTION CRANE rises
It bears Mordos name

KANDELLS OFFICE INTERIOR DAY
KANDELL sits at his desk concentracting

A shadow passes across the window
KANDELL rises --

-- as a CIANT WRECKING BALL crashes through the glass
and brick demolishing the office --

FLATIRON BUILDING EXTERIOR DAY
The WRECKING BALL hangs from the huge Mordo CRANE

The ball swings back into space
It too bears the word Mordo

HELICOPTER INTERIOR DAY
The ground falls away
MORDO is silent enveloped in classical music again

CLOSE IN on his PILOTs neck The back is covered
with large yellow scales - like a REPTILEs

a boulder

artifacts and religious icons from around the world -

the Far East in particular

on a bird-shaped LECTERN The BOOK is a thick ancient
volume with an ornate leather cover
They tiptoe stealthily towards the BOOK

Elsewhere in the house we hear the sound
of TV COMMERCIALS

He reaches for the BOOK and lifts it from its pedistal
The THREE HOODS are immediately bathed in brilliant light
They scream

WONGS QUARTERS INTERIOR NIGHT

WONG carries his TEA back to the television
He is oblivious to the horrific OFF-SCREEN SCREAMS

TV HOST
Dr Strange youve written it must be
a dozen books on weird events and the
Occult And yet as a reader I get the
feeling you dont believe in any of it
Is that right

BLEEKER STREET ‘EXTERIOR NIGHT

MANNY MOE and CURLY come flying out of the
drawing room windows

They land agog and battered in the street
Their Armani suits are torn and smoking

Across the street SMOKE puts the car in gear
and drives away

Well Oprah I must confess
I AM something of a Sceptic

TVSTUDIO INTERIOR NIGHT

TANYA ANDERS watches from the Studio audience
An attractive woman in her mid 20s she
looks as if she hasnt slept in a long time

in is ‘the power of the Human Brain
Did you know we use less than
FIVE PERCENT of the capacity
of our Unconscious Minds

STRANGE
(oblivious)

Didnt I Great Scott

She hammers the Lift Call button

STRANGE becomes aware that someones watching him
He turns around Its TANYA ANDERS

the elevator doors DESPERATION in her eyes

MORDO

It has not been easy for me
But it has not been hard either
coming as I do from the GREATEST
EN€RGY-CONSUMING NATION IN THE WORLD

(applause)
But spare a thought if you will
for the rubber tapper in the Andes

or the components assembler in Bucharest

Who will deny him his democratic right

to own a building to travel to work

in his Executive Helicopter

Where will they find the Million

Megawatts to power their Bullet Trains
(the applause grows)

All of us here know the answer

The Third World cannot afford to wait

for high-tech windmills and solar

cells But - thanks to the generous

IMF LOANS we have secured for them -

they can afford the NUCLEAR OPTION NOW

MASSSIVE APPLAUSE

Pull back to reveal the huge logo of
MORDO ECO-NUCLEAR EXPORTS INC
Energy Too Cheap To Meter for the Emerging World

A RETAINER passes MORDO a portable phone

MORDO takes the call
ALL SOUNDS fade away An icy wind blows from the
earpiece We hear a distant RANTING ALIEN VOICE

MORDO listens with his head bowed

MORDO looks afraid

and poverty that surround the CAB

STEPHANIE

watches a huge banner saying END OF THE CENTURY SALE
going up outside

GUARD
Aint New Years still a couple
months away

STRANGE
It was last time I looked

STRANGE pauses in the doorway his eye caught by a
CASSETTE TAPE in the tape rack He pulls it out and
looks at it It is FALLIN’ RAIN by LINK WRAY

He obviously wants it But the price tag - SPECIAL
OLDIES SALE - 57 - makes him return it to the shelf

He exits the store

BLEEKER STREET EXTERIOR NIGHT
DOCTOR STRANGE crosses the street heading for his house

Somethings wrong but at first we dont quite figure it
out --- there is NO TRAFFIC on the street

STEAM begins to pour through all the subway grilles
as STRANGE approaches his residence

TWO CITY WORKERS with orange helmets stare at him with
cold grey pupil-less eyes

As STRANGE climbs the steps he hears the sound of
HAMMERING within

A car slides past him on the wet road and
the eerie moment ends

DRSTRANGES HALLWAY INTERIOR NIGHT

WONG is hammering a sheet of plywood over the drawing room

He shakes his head and takes DR STRANGEs topcoat
DR STRANGE frowns

WONG

STRANGE bows to KANDELL clasping his hands in front
of him KANDELL walks over to him barely aided by
a cane

KANDELL
The time -has come

STRANGE looks up visibly alarmed
KANDELL betrays no emotion

STRANGE
Three men broke in tonight

KANDELL

Mordo
STRANGE

Mordo But he gave us his word --
KANDELL

GREENWICH VILLAGE EXTERIOR NIGHT

Seen from above the Brownstone and the new developments
which surround the Village A light glows in the
hedxagonal window of the upper room

STRANGES VOICE

By the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak
By the Shades of the Seraphim
Waft the Vapors and Valtorr

By the Omnipotent Oshtur --

A FORK OF LIGHTNING arcs across the sky

UPPER ROOM INTERIOR NIGHT

DOCTOR STRANGE KANDELL and WONG are seated within a
FIVE-POINTED STAR drawn in salt on the dark wood floor
A candle burns in a dish of water set at each point

of the star

We see them from above

KANDELL and STRANGE are frozen in the lotus position
STRANGE wears a finely-woven CLOAK with a high collar
and a gold AMULET in the form of a sleeping EYE

WONG is awake wearing a Lakers cap hunched over a
LAP-TOP COMPUTER surrounded by maps and atlases

KANDELL
( his ancient voice
resonating powerfully)
Deus Infinitate Me Discipulorem
Res Ipso Loquitur Locus et Hora
Dormammu Rex Terrarum Mundi

The CAMERA moves from the high angle to a HORIZONTAL one

As it does so we become aware that STRANGE and KANDELL
are floating two feet off the ground

WONG
See anything

STRANGE
I see the SUN

STRANGES POV - a tiny SUN rises in the corner of the room

KANDELL
And I the MOON

His POV - the MOON rising behind a bookcase

STRANGE
I see the Moon now

KANDELL
And I the Sun

the miniature SUN and MOON approach each other

STRANGE and KANDELL-
(in unison)
Eclipse

WONG punches his computer keyboard
Information flicks across the screen

WONG
(reading)
Eclipse Total October 26th

He takes off his hat and slaps it against his side
Instantly the IMAGES are dispelled

STRANGE floats earthward

STRANGE
Thats three days from today

WONG
(still computing)
And visible only from West
USA and Pacific Rim

KANDELLs eyes are still closed and he appears to be

in a trance Yet his hand reaches out and deals WONG
and STRANGE each a sharp blow on the shoulder

with his cane

KANDELL
I suggest we apply all our
energy to the job at hand

STRANGE and WONG are chastened At once they assume
prayerful postures and resume their chants

NEWARK NJ EXTERIOR NIGHT

We pass over smoking waste-processing plants and the
Airport and approach a run-down APARTMENT COMPLEX

TANYA ANDERS APARTMENT INTERIOR NIGHT

TANYA sits bolt upright on a sofa surrounded by
half-unpacked suitcases and assorted mess

She has not lived here long The room has HG Wells
War of the Worlds wallpaper TANYA stares at the TV
trying not to fall asleep

TV VOICE
-- to mourn the death of Twinky the
worlds last surviving Indian Elephant
In Cambodia a earthquake measuring 67
levelled the Ruins of Angkor Wat --

TANYAs eyelids start to close
Fade in the sound of INCANTATIONS

MORDOS OFFICE INTERIOR NIGHT

MORDO sits behind a massive marble desk

His office is in darkness BRILLIANT YELLOW LIGHT
emanates from his desktop computer and bathes him and
the Science and Industry Mural on his office wall

The light seems to tear at his skin cracking and
wrinkling it At the same time MORDO is growing larger
more muscular his features more defined

Over the INCANTATIONS we hear the mad demonic VOICE
which summoned him by phone

TANYAS APARTMENT INTERIOR NIGHT

TANYA wakes up screaming PAN TO the cockroaches

scattering across the Martian Walking Machines marching
across her walls

UPPER ROOM INTERIOR DAWN

STRANGE and KANDELL sit with their eyes closed within the
pentagram The CANDLES are extinguished
WONG enters carrying coffee on a tray

WONG
Anything
STRANGE opens his eyes He rubs his temples
STRANGE
Blank Hes put a block on it

We know the time but not the place

WONG holds a coffee out to KANDELL
KANDELL his eyes still closed waves it away

KANDELL
No thank you Wong

STRANGE
In three days time an Unimaginable
Evil will be released into the World
The Dark Millenium that the
ancients spoke of - a Thousand Years
of Terror for Mankind Unless

He picks up an Atlas and begins to study the Pacific pages
KANDELL stirs and stretches

WONG
The Final Dark Age Master
is that why Mordo tried to steal BOOK

KANDELL
T doubt it He already has more
power than he knows what to do with
I think it was a blind - to test
our strength

STRANGE scans the pages of the Atlas rubbing his weary eyes
WONG exits KANDELL rises and heads for the attic door
to the roof
STRANGE
If we should fail --

KANDELL
We dare not fail Dont tire yourself
out now Walk softly on the murmuring
waters Survey the sky and
trace the shadow of the bird

KANDELL opens the door A gust of cold wind rustles
STRANGEs cloak STRANGE looks up and sees --

-- KANDELL framed against a MAGNIFICENT PANORAMA OF THE
HIMALAYAS It is the same mountain range we saw on
WONGs postcard and KANDELLs office wall

But it is real and it is right outside the door

We hear wind chimes and the lowing of a herd of yaks

KANDELL steps outside and shuts the door

WONG re-enters the room

WONG
Where he go

STRANGE
Home

WONG

He forgot his stick

WONG picks up KANDELLs cane and hurries to the attic door
He opens it --

ANGLE ON the dirty copper-green roof covered with dust
and pigeon shit Traffic noise and brown carbon
monoxide haze

WONG
Damn it
Pretty fast for old feller

WONG grabs the Book of the Vishanti heads downstairs
STRANGE follows him

STRANGE
He seems older though

WONG

Masters You listen what

They enter the --

STUDY INTERIOR MORNING

WONG draws the curtains puts the Book of the Vishanti
in a wall safe hidden behind a set of false volumes

STRANGE
Im going to leave my body for
a while Keep an eye on it for me

WONG
Sure thing boss
(warning)
Not be gone long

STRANGE slumps into a big armchair

He starts to lean his head against his hand
His body freezes up before the motion is complete
For a moment all is still Then --

-- A BLACK and WHITE IMAGE OF DOCTOR STRANGE
bursts out of his body and swoops upward passing

unobstructed through the wall

ABOVE GREENWICH VILLAGE EXTERIOR MORNING
Liberated from the tired burden of its physical being

DR STRANGES ASTRAL FORM spirals upwards

rising high above his house

Though the streets are crowded no one observes

his invisible MONOCHROMATIC SELF as it floats effortlessly
above the city pondering the next move

DR STRANGE eyes the TWIN SKYSCRAPERS bearing the MORDO
INDUSTRIES logo rising from what was once Harlem

Decision made he streaks towards the TOWERS

MORDOS OUTER OFFICE INTERIOR DAY

We track through a large open-plan space

The walls are decorated with the names and logos of

the many Mordo Industries Subsidiaries Colour photographs
depict their diverse functions -- TOBACCO FARMING AEROSOL
SPRAY MANUFACTURE STRIP MINES RAINFOREST-FELLING PROGRAMS
NUCLEAR EXPORTS TO THE THIRD WORLD

A crowd of anxious MINIONS waits outside the door to the
only private office in the place MORDO can be heard within

MORDO 0S
Pathetic amateurs
What the Hell went wrong

MORDO glares at the FOUR OCCUPANTS of his top-floor
corner-window office

They are FOUR MEDIAEVAL DEMONS They have forked tongues
cloven hoofs and horns They are --

A tap at the door MORDO buzzes his secretary in

Instantly his DEMON FAMILIARS are transformed into
their human incarnations - PEDICURIST PILOT ACCOUNTANT
and CHIEF OF LEGAL AFFAIRS

SECRETARY
The Chairman of the Board of General
Motors is waiting in reception
Also the Brazilian President

MORDO ignores her He prowls among his MINIONS
She follows dutifully

MORDO

(aware that his SECRETARY

is dogging him)
-- What

SECRETARY

Aluminum Waste operation

MORDO
Sue him And double the output

She exits smartly As she passes the window
we catch a glimpse of DR STRANGES ASTRAL FORM outside

QUTSIDE THE BUILDING DAY

-- clinging like an astral fly to the glass
peering into MORDOS CORNER OFFICE upside down

He sees the SECRETARY leave He is
- unfazed as the DEMONS resume their real selves

Then MORDOs desktop computer starts to smoke
and DR STRANGE slips through the window glass into --

MORDOS OFFICE INTERIOR DAY

All eyes are fixed on the COMPUTER SCREEN

The DEMONS gather around MORDO to bathe in the
emanating yellow brilliance

DORMAMMUS VOICE IS HEARD

It is deep resonant and commanding

the voice of a great RULER and WARLORD
It is also the voice of the ranting DEMON
from TANYAs dream

DORMAMMUS VOICE
Well Mordo

The DEMONS bow their heads respectfully
MORDO stares straight into the screen

MORDO
All is prepared Dormammu

DORMAMMUS VOICE
And the Ancient One

MORDO
Old and infirm
He is of no consequence

STRANGES PSYCHIC PRESENCE passes through the room
A couple of the demons look up and sniff the air

BAAL
Hes lying Mordo tried to steal
his mysstic texxts He got his
assssss kicked

MORDO glowers at BAAL swirling smokily around him

DORMAMMU
Mordo you are a fool

MORDO opens his mouth to speak The YELLOW LIGHT roots
him to the spot MORDO can barely breathe

MORDO
Master --

DORMAMMU

EF wont be beaten by the Ancient Ones
this time Mordo Ive waited for this
for 200000 years The Old Man must die

The light tightens its grip on MORDO
MORDOs ribs begin to crack

MORDO
Dormammu - I swear -
In three days --

DORMAMMU
Silence Dont you know
that even now his PUPILS ASTRAL PRESENCE
is here spying on you

LIGHTNING FLASH The DEMONS begin to bay and howl
The yellow light vanishes and MORDO jumps back
shouting an ancient spell in Sanskrit
BRIGHT LIGHT from the tips of MORDOs fingers
surges forth and rakes the room

It strikes DR STRANGEs astral form in the solar plexus
revealing his presence and knocking his psychic self
spinning The DEMONS hiss and howl

MORDO
Strange Well this is going

to be a pleasure
STRANGE vanishes

The DEMONS look at MORDO and at each other
The hairs on their bristly heads stand up --

-- CRASH A BARRAGE of LIGHTNING BOLTS and EERIE RAYS
pour through the ceiling setting the room ablaze

Everything electrical SHORT-CIRCUITS

The desktop Computer hit by forked lightning EXPLODES

ABOVE THE BUILDING DAY

DOCTOR STRANGE hangs in the air with his arms
outstretched

WAVES OF ENERGY in which lighting spontaneously forms
flow from his fingertips into the SKYSCRAPER below
Beads of ASTRAL SWEAT break out on his forehead

This massive psychic blast is draining

his energy fast

MORDOS OUTER OFFICE INTERIOR DAY

Computer terminals blaze
The sprinkler system activates

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GENERAL MOTORS
and the PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL run for their lives

MORDOS OFFICE INTERIOR DAY
All is smoke flame crackling electrical discharges

and pouring water MORDO stands at his burning desk
furiously emitting ENERGY RAYS of his own

Huge black-veined WINGS burst through the fabric of
BEELZEBUBs suit MOLOCH bundles up the lightning bolts
and hurls them back at STRANGE

ABOVE THE BUILDING DAY

STRANGE dodges the rays and the ball lightning

Suddenly he is wrapped in SMOKE

Blindly he hurtles away from the MORDO BUILDING

at STRANGEs diminishing astral form

May the Vapors of Valtorr

buzzing after STRANGE

MOLOCHs astral form bursts from his body
and streaks off beside his brother demon
ABOVE NEW YORK

STRANGE wrestles with BAALs ethereal smoky
substance It is choking him

Out of the corner of his eye he sees the astral form
of MOLOCH and the black shadow of BEELZEBUB flapping
towards him

He shouts a rapid incantation --

-- and his astral self shatters as if it were a mirror
A THOUSAND ASTRAL STRANGES blossom like a rocket
flying in all directions

MOLOCH expands his astral self ballooning
out across the sky

TANYA runs water from the hot tap into a cup
of instant coffee granules

Exhausted totally defeated she carries

the cup into her little room and sits down

on a chair littered with newspapers and clothes

She stares at the PILE OF PILLS lying on a magazine
cover It is an old copy of the Greenpeace magazine and
deals with GLOBAL WARMING

TANYA reaches for the pills
She takes a HANDFULL --

-- Suddenly DOCTOR STRANGES ASTRAL FORM comes
barrelling through the wall of her apartment

TANYA screams

DOCTOR STRANGE is half way through the building before

he realises she has seen him In spite of the pressing
danger he hangs a 180 degree turn and REAPPEARS

in TANYAs tiny apartment

He sees the PILLS in her hands

STRANGE
I wouldnt do that if I were you
There arent enough to kill you
Youll just feel terrible
Chin up Ciao

TANYA screams and drops the pills

DOCTOR STRANGE utters an Inca shrinking spell in Quechua
- immediately his MONOCHROMATIC FORM shrinks till it

is smaller than the floorboard molecules

and falls through the floor

TANYA shakes her head

TANYA
No No No no no no no

She grabs the PILLS and runs with them into the BATHROOM
Struggles with the grimy opaque window

throwing it open and tossing the PILLS

into the WASTE RECYCLING PLANT below

She pauses catching her breath forcing herself to calm
down Concentrating all her energy --

TANYA
Thats it Its over
Its going to stop right now

Then she looks up and sees the GIANT FIGURE of MOLOCH
floating in the sky Seconds later a wave of angry FLIES
batters the window blocking out the sight

TANYA
I dont know anything about it

(she takes the beer)

STRANGE
Where did you hear the name Dormammu

TANYA
I knew it was a name
Does it mean like the Devil
Cause I checked it out you know
thinking it might be a traditional
demon like Mammon or Zabulon
There was no reference

STRANGE
Dormammu isnt listed yet

TANYA
No but he plans to be right

STRANGE
Tanya somethings going on here
If Im going to find out what
you have to tell me --
Where did you hear that name

TANYA
(suddenly scared)
In my dream

STRANGE
Dormammu is a being who exists
how shall I put this I have to say
outside of our reality Until very recently
all the main philosophies and religions
believed in an Alternate Reality Most of
the Worlds mythologies tell of mysterious
travellers who crossed into other universes
and of a race of Ancient Ones who guard
the gateways to those unknown worlds

TANYA
And D

STRANGE
Dormammu is the Master of another realm
- a Dark Dimension Unfortunately

he is greedy and his eyes are
fixed on Earth

TANYA
What does he want

STRANGE
To enslave the Planet Extract its
spiritual life its psychic resources
Exact his tribute for a thousand years
Perhaps you saw the details in your dream

TANYA nods She is shaking clinging to her beer

TANYA
It was a Nightmare not a dream
Was that Dormammu today in the sky

STRANGE
Just one of his familiars
Dormammu isnt part of our reality -
yet

TANYA
And you What are you
What were you doing in my oom

STRANGE
I am a student of the mystic arts
A pupil of the Ancient Sorcerer
who guards the borders of our sanity
Today you saw my soul

TANYA buries her face in her hands WONG whispers to STRANGE

STRANGE
Tanya I know this is difficult for you --
TANYA
Youre damned right it is
I didnt want to hear all this
I came here to be told there was like
like a LOGICAL EXPLANATION
I wanted you to reassure me --

STRANGE -
There is no reassurance
Were on the edge of an abyss

TANYA sobs hiding her face
WONG sits beside her on the couch

TANYA
Leave me alone

WONG
Tanya I very sorry but we need
to know all that we can about
Dormammus Plan You must
tell us your dream

of TANYAs dream

STRANGE
Tell me again

TANYA
I saw rocks rising from the ground
They were enormous They had
human faces Human forms
There were four of them all
crashed together at the corners

She points at the FOUR CORNERS sign
She feels very stupid

They both look at the TRAIN The COW is off the tracks
now and the CREW are boarding Synthetic whistle

TANYA
Maybe we should get back on

The BULLET TRAIN lurches forward and hurtles on its way
Dust blows through the station

DR STRANGE takes a stick and throws it in the air
It lands pointing in no particular direction

The SUN comes up
STRANGE
Whenever possible
follow your instincts

He heads off walking in the direction of the stick
TANYA follows

DESERT EXTERIOR DAY

They follow tire tracks along a shallow creek bed
A desert of red rocks heats up above them

TWO LANE BLACKTOP EXTERIOR DAY

STRANGE and TANYA wait beside the road

It is extremely hot There is no shade

TANYA sits on the ground

THey both stare fixedly at an old CONVERTIBLE
approaching out of the heat haze
TANYA
He wont stop Hes not real
anyway Hes a mirage

STRANGE strokes his chin in an unconscious immitation
of KANDELL his former Master

STRANGE
You should cut down on the
pessimism Tanya Its stunting
your spiritual growth

TANYA
Thank you for your concern
However I do not plan to enlarge
my spirit in the forseeable future

STRANGE sticks out his thumb
The CONVERTIBLE gets closer
TANYA reluctantly sticks hers out too

The convertible stops It is an 68 Impala driven by a
dashing young Apache BENNY

BENNY
Where you headed
STRANGE
Well There wouldnt be an area of

red earth and distinctive manlike
rock formations anywhere around -here
would there

BENNY
You mean the Valley of the Gods
Yeah I passed it about 30 miles back

STRANGE and TANYA weigh up the prospect of a 30-mile hike
BENNY jerks a thumb at the passenger seat

BENNY
Want me to give you a ride

IMPALA INTEXT DAY

BENNY heads back down the long stretch with
STRANGE and TANYA on the bench seat next to him

Tall red dunes on either side

BENNY
Never been to Valley of the Gods
before Youre in for a TRIP
I never take the Interstate
man For me this is the only
road there is Seen the commercial
for the new Tucker They made it
right here

STRANGE grips TANYAs hand She squeezes back
He becomes self-conscious and lets go

BENNY
They make all the big TV
commercials out here American
Methanol Alco-Pops Mord-Air

The IMPALA crests the rise to reveal --

THE VALLEY OF THE GODS EXTERIOR DAY

A wide mesa of red sand from which enormous
ROCK FORMATIONS rise They have the forms of human
hands and fingers and the backs of dinosaurs

BENNY
Not too shabby
STRANGE stares at TANYA TANYA sighs

TANYA
This isnt it

STRANGE gazes at the massive panorama filled with
frustration On the horizon black smoke drifts from
a Smelting Factory

STRANGE

There are emanations though
BENNY

You bet there are This whole

area used to be an inland sea
Two thousand five hundred years
ago the Navajo navy docked here

STRANGE gets out of the car

STRANGE
Please excuse me for a second

Carrying his bag he heads down a narrow trail and
disappears behind a butte

BENNY
He your boyfriend

TANYA
No Hes ona furlough from
the Mental Hospital Im taking
him to see the brain surgeon

BENNY nods
BENNY
You guys must be from LA

ALONELY SPOT

-- behind a GIANT FINGER OF ROCK STRANGE sketches a4

and dons the Cloak of Levitation Standing withing the
pentagram he casts a spell

Immediately he rises several inches from the ground

STRANGE

INTERIOR DAY

HOLDING TANK NYC JAIL

WONG sits cross-legged in a chalk pentagram
of his own SEVERAL PRISONERS watch him doubtfully

WONG opens his eyes He sees a holographic vision of

BOARD OF TRADE CHICAGO INTERIOR DAY

We look down from the visitors gallery

at the busy trading floor HUNDREDS OF TRADERS are
bidding beneath the big boards which announce futures and
the markets around the world

MORDO is at the centre of a group of industrious
shirt-sleeved BROKERS

TRADING FLOOR INTERIOR DAY

Suddenly we see the scene for what it really is --
the Nerve Centre of DORMAMMUS WAR AGAINST EARTH

The big boards which appeared to read futures
now display FAMINE POLLUTION and WAR

BEELZEBUB ASMODEUS and MOLOCH superintend ocean dumping
ozone depletion and arms sales respectively

BAAL in a traders blazer hurries up to MORDO

BAAL
Weve located Strange Hes making
contact with his man Wong
(wheedling)
Let me sssssee to it

MORDO glances at the big digital COUNTDOWN CLOCK
It reads 1800 HOURS AND COUNTING

MORDO
Take out the woman first

BAAL wafts smokily away

VALLEY OF THE GODS EXTERIOR DAY

TANYA sits in the Chevy smoking cigarettes
BENNY produces THREE KACHINA DOLLS from

the trunk He presents them to her very seriously
TANYA
Theyre cute Did you make

‘em yourself

BENNY
Yeah My people made ‘em
TANYA
The Navajo
BENNY
Im not Navajo Im Jicarilla Apache
TANYA
These dolls were made by the Apache
BENNY
These dolls are Hopi from New
Mexico School kids on

the Reservation make ‘em

TANYA
This tag says it was made
in the EEC

BENNY stares at the SHADOW OF A CLOUD
wafting across the mesa towards them

BENNY

Normally they cost 50 apiece --
TANYA

Is there a bar around here

The shadow flits towards them
We share its POV - hurtling towards the car

BENNY
Not on the Res Theres one
about twenty miles THAT WAY
over by the Smelter
Ill give you two for 35 bucks

He dangles one of the dolls appealingly
THE SHADOW passes directly over them

BENNY
Theyre called Kachina Dolls
They bring good luck
A SHADOW PASSES OVER THEM
The DOLLs painted eyes swivel and fix on TANYA
TANYA jolts back with a shout

Too late The DOLL jumps from BENNYs hands and
head-butts him The SECOND DOLL stands on the seat
and turns the key in the ignition

A THIRD grabs TANYAs seat belt locking her in

She screams --

IN THE LONELY SPOT

DCOTOR STRANGE hangs several feet in the air
in profound meditation

We hear the Chevy motor roar the scream grow fainter

IMPALA INTERIOR DAY

The CAR hurtles through the desert steered by
ONE OF THE DOLLS The SECOND DOLL stands on the
gas pedal holding it to the metal

The THIRD DOLL holds TANYAs seat belt tightly shut

BENNY is unconscious TANNYA is trapped
The DOLLS laugh

IN THE LONELY SPOT
DR STRANGE floats in his meditative trance

Seen eee a ce ceee eee eee eee a ee

The Chevy can hardly be heard Suddenly his eyes open

DESERT EXTERIOR DAY
The car races towards the rim of a dry-river canyon

A shadow follows It is the AIRBORNE FORM
of DOCTOR STRANGE

STRANGE
By the Shade of the Seraphim --

Strange looses a wave of benign PSYCHIC ENERGY
The DESERT PLANTS respond

Turning and twisting the cholla cactus and creosote
bushes reach out and grab the wheels of the
speeding car

Several bushes are uprooted But the plants hang on
spinning and tangling in the wheel wells
FOUR TUMBLEWEEDS roll up and wrap around the axles

The car slows

IMPALA INTERIOR DAY

The KACHINAS gun the motor but the wheels are

caught fast The car slews sideways --
PRECIPICE EXTERIOR DAY

-- coming to rest half-on half-off the edge of the
ravine held in place by a tangle of desert plants

The KACHINA DOLLS jump out and start to run away
STRANGE swoops down and BLASTS THEM with a powerful ray
BAAL screams abandoning the dolls and wafting up at him --

STRANGE
May the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak
encircle and consign you to
your Dark Dimension --

CRAK CRAK The solid crimson bands of ancient lore
encircle BAAL creating a boxlike trap through which not
even the DEMONs ethereal substance can pass

STRANGE alights directing the box with closing motions of
his hands His cloak billows around him
TANYA struggles out of the seat belt

STRANGE
-- never in the name of Ragorr to return

The BOX-LIKE TRAP speeds skyward disappearing like a COMET

STRANGE gathers up the dolls BENNY rubs his head
TANYA gets as far away from the CAR and STRANGE as she can

BENNY
What happened to my Chevy
STRANGE
Permit me

STRANGE walk s over to the precariously positioned CAR
He eyeballs it and makes a HAND GESTURE --

-- the CACTI and BRANCHES drag the Chevy back out of the
ravine

BENNY and TANYA watch agog as the DESERT PLANTS turn the car
completely around and set it pointing down an old
wagon trail The longest branches dust the seats

TANYA
(yelling at STRANGE)
Thats it man Ive had enough
of this insanity No more running
hiding jumping dolls and cactus shit
for me I quit

STRANGE gets annoyed He lifts a hand palm open
and blows a cloud of pink light at her

(Its benign appearance indicates that it is the non-lethal
Sleep-inducing Mist of Forgetfulness)

TANYA makes a mystic gesture of her own
and blocks it

The mist bounces off the rocks wafting away
and knocking out a couple of bunnies

STRANGE
Where did you learn to do that

TANYA
I didnt learn to do that
Its just a gesture
something I do
Stay away from me

STRANGE
This is extraordinary
I knew you were precognitive
but this is A manifestation
of the Ninth Laotian Tao
unprecidented

TANYA
What are you saying

BENNY
Hes telling you youre a witch
TANYA
I need a beer Right now
BAR EXTERIOR AFTERNOON

The Mordo Industries Smelter loom large on the horizon

TANYA and STRANGE climb out of BENNYs Chevy
BENNY turns in the dirt road and heads back past
the sign saying Kayenta Navajo Reservation

Ahead of them is a prefabricated structure whose paint
and plaster have been scoured off by the fumes that billow
from the Smelters eight chimneys

An extinct Neon Sign says Bar Fun
TRUCKS and EIGHTEEN WHEELERS are parked outside

the CACTUS are all dead and brittle-white

TANYA
If theres a phone in here
Im calling a Taxi and its Adios
You do what you want Im watching
the end of the world on TV in a motel
By the Pool

STRANGE opens the bar door for her
His Cloak flaps in the wind TANYA is limping

Their POV --

BAR INTERIOR AFTERNOON

-- populated by TEN HEAVY LOOKING DUDES
a BARTENDER and an OLD INDIAN

The DUDES are mostly shift workers from the Mordo
Plant Their baseball caps say things like IN SEARCH
OF ENEMIES

The OLD INDIAN is putting money in the Juke Box
He wears a black Resistol hat with eagle feathers

TANYA and DOC approach the bar
The HEAVIES stare intently at his CLOAK
She shakes her head avoiding looking at the EVIL DUDES

DOC appears oblivious Someone else whistles

STRANGE
Can I order a couple breakfasts
barman Say two scrambled eggs
with bagels no lox

The BARMAN stares at the BIG TRUCKER approaching

TANYA
(whispering in DOCs ear)
Doc if theres any trouble you
can you know wipe the floor with these
guys cant you

STRANGE
Unfortunately no
If I use any magic Mordos demons
will be down on us agai‘n
(to the BARMAN)
A beer and a dry martini please

The TRUCKER looms over DOC and TANYA

TRUCKER
They dont serve freaks here
Especially freaks in capes

STRTANGE
This isnt a cape its a Cloak

THE TRUCKER does not understand
He grunts and aims a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at DOCs head --

The OLD INDIAN purses his lips and blows --

-- and the HUGE TRUCKER is lifted off his feet by a terrific

wind and hurtled the length of the bar and out the batwing

doors caught up in the EYE of a HURRICANE

The other TRUCKERS and PLANT WORKERS follow hurled
spluttering and screaming out into the desert wastes

Silence falls DOC TANYA and the OLD INDIAN remain
The BARMAN appears from beneath the bar

BARMAN
I dont have Martini Mix mister
Will a beer be ok
STRANGE nods TANYA shakes her head

OLD INDIAN
You must be Doc Strange

STRANGE and TANYA nod

A song comes on the Wurlitzer juke box
It is Link Wrays Fallin’ Rain

STRANGE
Thats right And you -

OLD INDIAN
You dont know me but I heard
about you on the ether wave
(Chis eyes dart skywards
for a moment)
You got your work cut out for you
and no mistake
(he extends a hand)

Names Joe Ten Wives

They shake hands

STRANGE
Stephen Strange And this is --

TEN WIVES
The lady whose feet hurt
Why dont you both sit down

TANYA sits down already detesting the OLD MAN
The BARTENDER hurries over with their beers

STRANGE
Joe you know of a special place
with certain rocks out here
Rocks like human hands and faces
A medicine place

TEN WIVES shakes his head It appears he knows
exactly what DOC is on about

TEN WIVES
Its not here
(STRANGE offers him a beer
JOE TEN WIVES declines)
Place youre looking for is
a water place You have to
get with the water gods about it

ANGLE ON TANYA utterly bored and frustrated
with this gibberish

TEN WIVES
Aint too many water gods out here

STRANGE
What about gods of the air

TANYA
Let go of my foot

ANGLE ON TEN WIVES gnarled old hands gripping one of
TANYAs bruised and blistered feet

TEN WIVES
You know what your problem is
You had a small stroke when
you were in the crib and you
lost track of your MEDICINE ANIMAL

TANYA

My problem is my feet are so
swollen I cant put my shoes on

TEN WIVES rubs her feet and blows on them humming

TANYA
Let ‘em go

He lets go Her feet have un-swollen
The blisters are gone

TEN WIVES’

Gods of the air Oh yeah
We got ‘em

DESERT EXTERIOR NIGHT

STRANGE and TANYA stand with TEN WIVES in the centre
of a ring of Navajo in ceremonial garb

TEN WIVES starts to sing

Heat lightning flickers on the horizon
lighting up the VAST BUTTE behind them

It begins to RAIN

TANYA
Doc the old mans gonna catch a COLD

THE RAIN FAST BECOMES A DOWNPOUR

TEN WIVES keeps singing and dancing
The NAVAJO keep dancing too DOC stares at the lightning

TANYA runs for the shelter of the cars

She passes through the ring of dancing Navajo and --

-- lightning and thunder crash simultaneously in front
of her The white image of QUETZALCOATL - the plumed
serpent thirty eight feet tall - appears over her head

TEN WIVES sings louder more frenziedly
TANYA freezes staring into the eyes of the GOD

The giant bird-reptile raises a scaled feathered claw

and points directly at TANYA
QUETZALCOATL

Nefertiti Wayquey Ahkenaten --

CRASH Behind TANYA a bolt of lightning
hits TEN WIVES The SERPENTS IMAGE vanishes

TEN WIVES crumples to the earth

STRANGE rushes to the old mans side
He feels for a pulse There is none

STRANGE
Damn you Mordo Not again

He turns the body over pounds the old mans heart
Even though he his task is hopeless

The rain dies suddenly LAUGHTER

The FACE OF MORDO appears - dwarf-image of the
HEAD OF DORMAMMU which appeared in the sky over New York

MORDO
Yes Strange Again And it is
JUST BEGINNING

LAUGHTER rackets around the buttes crackling off power
cables and the radio of a pickup truck

Offended the earth of the HOLY PLACE rumbles
A slab of butte dislodges The LAUGHTER fades away
N

KAYENTA MOTEL EXTERIOR NIGHT

A humble motel A light burns in the furthest cabin
The Tribal Taxi pulls away -Rain falls in
the swimming pool

MOTEL ROOM INTERIOR NIGHT

DR STRANGE takes a big salt-shaker from their GROCERY BAG
and sprinkles a PENTAGRAM around TANYAs bed
TANYA takes a bottle of brandy from the bag

Rain courses down the window making eerie
patterns down the shade

TANYA
Youre supposed to use garlic

STRANGE
Thats for vampires

TANYA
Oh

She offers him a shot of brandy in the plastic room cup
He declines

STRANGE
Survey the sky and trace the
shadow of the bird

He puzzles over KANDELLs words
Repeats them to himself --

TANYA
Forget it Doc Youre out of
luck You havent found out what

you needed to know And now --

(consults her watch)
Youre almost out of time

Whats Nefertiti by the way

STRANGE
Nefertiti was the wife of an
Egyptian god-king called Ahkenaten
Some said she was the greatest
sorceress in the world
Survey the sky Survey the sky
Im going to leave my body for a while
TANYA
Be my guest

TANYA turns up the volume on the television
She adjusts the air conditioning to MAXIMUM

STRANGE
Would you mind keeping an eye
on it for me Youre safe

as long as you remain within the salt
While Im gone you might try
something the Zen scholars do --

its called mushin no shin and

it means empty your mind

TANYA
If its all the same to you
Ill watch Tv

STRANGE
Tanya I cant tell you
how important this is --

TANYA
No youre right you cant
You go and do your thing Doc
Im gonna sit right here and
watch Mr Ed

STRANGE
If you could see inside you
youd see a tremendous psychic
energy going to waste --

TANYA -
Are you looking inside me
Cut it out You freak

STRANGE
Dormammu isnt here just yet
There is still time --
TANYA

Time for Mr Ed

She turns up the volume on the TV
The familiar theme plays TANYAs hands are shaking

STRANGE sighs Never has he felt so hopeful and so
far from victory at the same moment

He dons his Cloak and amulet and sits down in the narrow
space between the bed and the TV He starts to levitate

TANYA
Be careful Doc

STRANGE
May the Seraphim protect you

TANYA
And may the Vishanti softly
speak thy name

STRANGES ASTRAL FORM flickers away
TANYA frowns

KAYENTA MOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

His monoc”hromatic ASTRAL FORM slips through
the roof of the cabin and vanishes into the low cloud

Thunder rumbles

MOTEL ROOM INTERIOR NIGHT

TANYA approaches DR STRANGEs frozen form
His chest moves lightly up and down

She feels his pulse Impulsively she gives him a kiss
on the cheek

MORDOS VOICE
How touching Mind if I watch
TANYA screams and jumps up

The FACE OF MORDO stares at her from the TV SCREEN

MORDO
I really am surprised at him
This is the stupidest move
he could have made

utside the sound of MOTORCYCLES is heard

TANYA runs through the protective pentagram to the door --
She throws it open to reveal --

A DEMON MOTORCYCLE GANG led by the barely human
incarnations of BEELZEBUB MOLOCH and ASMODEUS
KAYENTA MOTEL EXTERIOR NIGHT

TANYA makes a break for it on foot
MORDOS LAUGHTER echoes from the TV within

ASMODEUS pursues TANYA into the desert
on a black and white checkered Hog

MOLOCH emerges from the cabin carrying DOCs
body which he tosses aboard BEELZEBUBs trike

ASMODEUS screeching with ghastly laughter
sweeps up TANYA and hauls her aboard his demon sickle

The UNEARTHLY BIKERS urged on by MORDOs incantations
rev their engines and take off --

-- BURNING A PATH ACROSS THE SKY

UPPER ATMOSPHERE EXTERIOR NIGHTDAY

DOCTOR STRANGEs ASTRAL FORM hangs in the
upper atmosphere

Below is the black globe of Earth at night
pinpricked by thousands of cities To the east
we see the blue crescent of the Earth at sunrise

The black backdrop of the Known Universe
hangs all around

DOCTOR STRANGE is at peace deep in meditation or prayer

An ancient defunct Spy Satellite spirals by
HIS POV --

A bright light like a satellite but gently
pulsing passing across the surface of the Night
Planet towards Day

ANGLE ON

The AMULET that hangs around the neck of the physical
DOCTOR STRANGE It pulses gently

PULL BACK to reveal DOCTOR STRANGES BODY
tossed aboard an airborne demon motor trike

Hurtling towards DAYBREAK

SOUTH SEA ISLAND EXTERIOR DAY

An idyllic paradise of green rolling hills
above a limitless choppy blue sea

We PAN across the pristine landscape till we come to
a tractor-hewn dirt road and a barbed-wire fence from
which a sign hangs

MORDO INDUSTRIES
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION SITE

SERVING THE FUTURE
PRESERVING THE PAST

The sound of MOTORCYCLES is heard

MORDO emerges from the PREFABRICATED HUT
surrounded by OIL DERRICKS

MORDO has grown another six inches

His skin is stretched tightly across his face and his
enormous bony hands

He wears a safari suit and carries a pair of binoculars

He watches with evident pleasure as the gates swing open
to admit --

THE DEMON MOTORCYCLE GANG

TANYA jumps down and runs at MORDO punches him on
the jugular He isnt fazed

TANYA
Asshole Peeping tom Freak

7h

MORDO brushes her aside He approaches DR STRANGEs inert

human form The hot engine of the trike has burned the
DOCTORs arm

MORDO
(crooning)
Doctor Strange At last
How long since he left his body

Five hours

MORDO
Oh excellent
(shouting in STRANGEs ear)
How does it feel to know your
bodys going to ROT and FALL APART
To realise youre doomed to wander the
Cosmos a LOST SOUL for all Eternity

MORDO tweaks STRANGEs nose He grabs STRANGE by
the hair prepares to slap him

MORDO
NOT GOOD huh

TANYA intervenes jumping on MORDOs back and biting
his rieck

TANYA
Youre a pretty tough guy
arent you Beating up on a body
when the owners ABSENT Well Ive
got news for you you big monkey
You blew it

MORDO cranes his neck around to gaze at her

MORDO
What do you mean

TANYA
I know where Dormammus gonna
try and break through see
And this isnt the place

MORDO shrugs her off and heads towards his HUT
TANYA
Yeah walk away You fool Youre
the one whos defeated Dormammus
aiming for a place where the ROCKS
have HUMAN FACES and this aint it

MORDO disappears into his hut and shuts the door
TANYA turns and stares defiantly at the DEMON BIKERS

They grin at her MOLOCH jerks his thumb
towards the little hill outside the gate

With a sinking feeling in her stomach TANYA walks
unhindered through the gate and up the little hill

From the top of it she has a fine view of --

THE GIANT STONE HEADS OF EASTER ISLAND

UPPER ATMOSPHERE EXTERIOR DAYNIGHT

DR STRANGES ASTRAL FORM hangs motionless in the lotus
position His lips do not move but we hear his voice
powerful and reverberating intoning an ANCIENT SPELL --

STRANGES VOICE
Oh Huarakan

Kukulkan

Gukumatz

Tlaloc

Magnificent Coatlicue
Quetzalcoatl
Telcatlipoca

Oh Centeotl

Brahma

Buddha

Kandell

Nefertiti

Merlin

Arkkin

Past and Future Sorcerers of Earth --

Below him behind the huge disc of Earth
MOONRISE has begun

STRANGES VOICE
Now as 1000 years ago and 2000
and 100000 come to the aid
of an unworthy planet Earth

Around him the STARS begin to move --
forming a PENTAGRAM within a HEXAGON

EASTER ISLAND EXTERIOR DAY

TANYA sits on the little hill

In MORDOS COMPOUND the DEMONS bat DOCTOR
STRANGEs body around as cats would a mouse
His arm is burned his lip is cut his face badly bruised

HUT INTERIOR DAY

MORDO makes his last conference call

He stares at the banks of tiny TV monitors showing
the eager faces of his PARTNERS in all manner of dealings

MORDO
Friends in precisely 20 minutes
time I want you to know
youre all fired

Their faces register confusion blankness or fear

MORDO smiles and hangs up the phone
The SCREENS all go blank

MORDOs smile is hideous - his lips crack and st
T art
bleed - his blood is yellowish-green “°

Suddenly there is an EARTH TREMOR Hie ic 4
¢ geologic instr
rattle MORDO rises hurries for the door g uments

EASTER ISLAND EXTERIOR DAY

MORDO reappears

His DEMONS and MINIONS leap to attention

Like a general at the head of his column MORDO marches
through the gate followed by his grotesque gang

The last two DEMONS drag the body of DOCTOR STRANGE
Dimly his EYE AMULET still glows

Atop the little hill TANYA in despair stares
at the sun

THE ECLIPSE HAS BEGUN

STRATOSPHERE EXTERIOR NIGHTDAY

DR STRANGE opens his astral eyes
He is at peace strengthened by his period of rest
and prayer

Below the LIGHT OF THE AMULET glows on a tiny island
in the Pacific marking the position of his human form

DR STRANGE stretches and executes a graceful flowing
dive towards the LIGHT

His astral form having no physical substance
there is no limit to his speed

EASTER ISLAND EXTERIOR DAY

A TOUR GUIDE leads his party of TOURISTS among the
enormous human faces of the Standing Stones

THUNDER

TOUR GUIDE
You will be able to view
the Eclipse from here
But please remember dont
stare directly at the sun

On the hill behind the TOURISTS MORDOS MINIONS appear
They form a triangular pattern with MORDO at the
epicenter TWO DEMONS seize TANYA TWO OTHERS hold
the human form of DOCTOR STRANGE

TOURIST
What are those people in
costume doing

TOUR GUIDE
No one knows the secret of the
Easter Island Heads what people
carved them or for what purpose
However Modern Science has
dcetermined that --

More thunder The sky is rapidly becoming cloudy

The DAY darkens more rapidly as the MOON passes
across the SUN

MORDO
(beginning his incantation)
DORMAMMU DOMINUS KTERKRARUM MUNDI
HORA GLORIA IPSO RES LOQUATUR EST

LIGHTNING Big raindrops
The TOURISTS run for their bus

TANYAs head throbs in intense pain

She looks past MORDO at DR STRANGEs body
STRANGEs astral self has been gone far too long
and it is obviously in a bad way

MORE LIGHTNING The MOON almost covers the SUN

Another earthquake rumble is heard

And suddenly incredibly the ECTOPLASMIC GHOSTLIKE IMAGES
of the EASTER ISLAND HEADS separate from their physical
forms and start to move towards each other --

converging around the largest most impressive head of all

The MOON obscures the SUN
And driven by a vast and hideous intelligence from
beyond this planet A HUGE STONE BODY forces the HEAD
out of the earth and writhing the GIANT STATUE
starts to tear apart the daynight sky - the very
fabric of the Universe itself --

TOURIST BUS INTERIOR DAY

The TOURISTS sit aboard their bus with the rain sleeting
down outside obscuring everything

Oblivious they buy plaster Mickey Mice and
try on native hats

EASTER ISLAND EXTERIOR DAY

For a few seconds the HOLE IN THE SKY closes
around the STATUE‘s hands The STATUE roars in pain

The PAIN in TANYAs head is agonizing
MORDO and HIS MINIONS keep up their daemonic shouting
of DORMAMMUs name Her dream is coming true

Then the RIP opens again revealing a SHIMMERING
AURA OF FLAME encircling the statues head
casting a GHASTLY GLOW over the landscape

And a voice so cold and merciless that it seems to
emanate from the stygian depths of hell is heard --

DORMAMMU
Now it begins
MORDO
Yes Dormammu Your Millenium

A Thousand Years of Terror for Mankind

The MINIONS are ecstatic Quivering with pleasure MORDO
grabs hold of TANYA and the senseless form of DR STRANGE

MORDO
Behold Master The first of
200 Billion Human Sacrifices

DR STRANGE opens his eyes His astral self is reunited
with his battered body He winks at TANYA

STRANGE
Dont bet on it

oM
STRANGE utters a powerful spell consigning the
nearest DEMONS to a distant dimension
MORDO stumbles almost falls

TANYA
boc

STRANGE throws out both arms emitting rays of brilliant
intensity The DEMONS shrink in fear

MORDO
You have gained nothing NOTHING

A BOLT OF WHITE LIGHTNING flashes from the EYE around
STRANGEs neck knocking MORDO on his ass

STRANGE turns his attention to the MONSTROUS MASTER DEMON

STRANGE
Too late Dormammu Youre a day
late and a dollar short as usual

DORMAMMUS BURNING HEAD FLARES UP IN ANGER

DORMAMMU
YOU are too late I am already here
You are alone

STRANGE
The Forces of Light are never alone
(throwing up his hands)
By Quetzalcoatl by Telcatlipoca
by the Centeotl by the Seraphim --

St Elmos Fire crackles up and down the STONE GIANT
The flickering fire which is DORMAMMU is partially
extinguished by the electrical charge

STRANGE
In the names of Juarakan
of Kukulkan of the Magnificent
Coatlicue Mother of All the Gods --

With each name LIGHTNING flashes from the Firmament and
strikes the statue The fire of DORMAMMU peels away
and pours back towards the RIP in the dimension

One of the GIANTs stone hands falls away
TANYA struggles with her CAPTORS STRANGE keeps up his
chant LIGHTNING strikes the giant again It stumbles

And as he calls their names the ASTRAL FORMS of former
SUPREME SORCERERS appear in the air around DR STRANGE -
forming a pentagram and hexagon of POINTS OF LIGHT

like atoms in a molecule girding their mystic power to his

We recognise QUETZALCOATL MERLIN ARKKAN and BUDDHA
and next to him the glimmering astral form of KANDELL
the Ancient One

DORMAMMU roars in anguish

Almost completely separated from the STONE GOLEM now -
DORMAMMU pours back through the rip in reality as

the GIANT gropes blindly in the air with his

remaining hand

Another BOLT takes a huge chunk from his granite flank

A typhoon rages through the island
Suddenly the SUN appears

MORDO realises the game is up He runs towards the
flickering gap between dimensions

MORDO
Take me with you Lord
Ive served you well --
Dont leave me

DORMAMMUS MAD EYES peer at MORDO through the gap
For a second it looks as if the STONE GIANT will crush

him Then it points to TANYA

MORDO understands He grabs her freeing her from
the clutch of his disintegrating DEMONS Clutchingber
to his side he steps into the enormous stone paw --

STRANGE
No Mordo Dormammu I command you --

MORDO
See you later Strange

The GIANT reaches up and hands MORDO and TANYA through
the gap to DORMAMMU

WHAP The fissure in reality snaps shut

DORMAMMU is gone His demons have vanished or become
centipedes or salamanders scurrying to get out of the
brightening SUN The landscape glows

The rip in the dimensional barrier flickers like
the dying radiance of a radium-painted watch

STRANGE tears off his shirt He wraps it around his
burned and blistered arm He steps towards the RIP

The IMAGES of the ANCIENT SORCERERS are gone
Only that of MERLIN still hangs faintly in the air

MERLIN
Do not attempt to follow
Sorcerer You can do nothing
for her on the Other Side
STRANGE peers into the glimmering remnants of the
fissure Through them only darkness and distant
GREEN FIRE are visible
He takes a step towards the gap
MERLINs image shakes its head
It strokes its beard as KANDELL was wont to
and disappears
STRANGE takes a step closer to the unknown

Above him the HUGE STONE IDOL frozen now
begins to creak and slip sideways towards him --

STRANGE steps into the ABYSMAL GAP

The STATUE crashes down where he once stood
It breaks apart shoulders and legs separating
from the trunk arms rolling away

The TOURISTS emerge from their buses

BLACKNESS
STRANGE hurtles through total darkness

Occasionally around him there are bright explosions
of green and yellow light

Suddenly FOUR CORNERS of pitch blackness slide apart

and DOCTOR STRANGE is through the Barrier
and in --

-- THE DARK DIMENSION

ww

THE DARK DIMENSION
The DARK DIMENSION cannot be described

It exceeds the maddest nightmares of Dali

Tanguy or DeChirico The rules of physics dont
apply here Nor do the rules of perspective
Nor do any rules at all

(Fortunately what cannot be described can be drawn
and the DD was copiously illustrated by Steve Ditko in
STRANGE TALES numbers 133 to 141)

DR STRANGE comes to rest on a platformpathway
winding through a forest of strange paterns
mutating colours shifting geometric shapes

The pathway splits in three directions
leading to three VAST ORNATE DOORS

STRANGE pauses at the crossroads concentrates
his energy A beam of light from the AMULET
reveals two of the paths to be HALLUCINATIONS -
pitfalls concealing a bottomless abyss

STRANGE takes the real path
GREAT DOORS swing open and admit him to --

DORMAMMUS THRONE ROOM

Not a room in any confining sense but another
distinct corner of the Dark Dimension

DOORWAYS to other dimensions are constantly
opening and closing here briefly revealing weird
exotic worlds

STRANGE follows the undulating path towards DORMAMMU
DORMAMMU sits brooding on a floating throne of

geometric crystal His head is still a MASS OF FIRE
in which white skull-like eyes are visible

DORMAMMU
Welcome Sorcerer

STRANGE
Where is Tanya Anders

DORMAMMU
tanyanders

DORMAMMU holds out his hands In one palm a RAINBOW
appears In the other a miniature NUCLEAR EXPLOSION

STRANGE
Cut the parlour tricks Dormammu
Ive come for my friend

DORMAMMU closes his palms The VISIONS vanish

DORMAMMU
Surely you mean Baron Mordo
You studied together didnt you
Lived as closely as brothers

An image of MORDO and the YOUNGER STRANGE appears
STRANGE and MORDO sit in meditative poses before KANDELL

STRANGE dispells the vision with the wave of a hand

STRANGE ©
Mordo betrayed our Master and
dishonoured our school
He is your brother now
The woman Dormammu

DORMAMMU
You want her Have her --

TANYA appears in a doorway overhead

She is unharmed but cannot hear or be heard
She is imprisoned in a soundless CRYSTAL TRAP
The doors slams and she is gone again

DORMAMMU
-- after you fight for her

STRANGE looks DORMAMMU in the eye

STRANGE
Okay Lets go

DORMAMMU
Not with me Strange I am the
Master here With one blink
I can destroy you
(he yawns)
I can destroy everything

STRANGE
Get to the point Dormammu
Who am I to fight

A doorway opens MORDO steps out
But this is a NEW MORDO - three times larger than before
and definitely no longer human Eyeless with huge

NIGHT VISION GOGGLES clad in green and silver armor

STRANGE
Hello Mordo

MORDO
(DORMAMMUs voice)
Goodbye Strange

ASMODEUS appears through another doorway
He wears a silver top hat and a checkered cape

ASMODEUS
You will do battle with Dormammus
Champion If you defeat him
you and the woman can return to
Earth If you lose Dormammu
will have your souls for all Eternity

STRANGE
Either way the woman gets
to go back

MORDO
NO

ASMODEUS

Your terms are unacceptable

STRANGE
They are my only terms

DORMAMMU roars with laughter
A thousand demons appear in doorways in the air
laughing in sycophantic immitation of their master

DORMAMMU
Well I must say you are a
caution Strange Ive not

encountered such defiance since
I have never enountered it

If I let the woman go will you
give me a better fight

STRANGE nods TANYA reappears

DORMAMMU
It is agreed

MORDO charges at STRANGE

STRANGE makes the path beneath him disappear
MORDO falls through the hole

STRANGE cleans his fingernails

DORMAMMU
Round one to Strange MORDO

MORDO comes crashing up through the path behind STRANGE
Furious he launches a tremendous THREE-POINTED BEAM
OF YELLOW LIGHT

STRANGE parries sculpting a SHIELD OF RED LIGHT out
of the air in front of him

The YELLOW LIGHT fractures and bounces off the RED
The RED LIGHT buckles

STRANGE throws back his head and from his forehead burst
FOUR WHITE COMETS of psychic energy

They dart at MORDO MORDO throws them off
with shimmering-heat like MENTAL WAVES --

-- catching DR STRANGE off balance
almost knocking him down --

His RED SHIELD cracks He builds ANOTHER ONE
white and double the size MORDOs yellow light
turns ORANGE RED --

ANGLE ON DORMAMMU

-- watching with evident pleasure

Doorways open in the sky behind him revealing
HUGE BLEACHERS full of DORMAMMUS CITIZENS
cheering MORDO or --

ANGLE ON MORDO

-- grunting and belching FIRE

ANGLE ON STRANGE

-- opening a BLACK HOLE in MORDOs reality

The HUGE SLICE of warped ANTI-MATTER
threatens to engulf MORDO

DORMAMMU
Bravo Bravo

DORMAMMU snaps his fingers and the ANTI-MATTER
vanishes MORDO jumps to his feet enraged

He unleashes a tremendous ENERGY BARRAGE at STRANGE
DOCTOR STRANGE jumps back baletically
building up new GEOMETRIC SHIELDS OF LIGHT

ANGLE ON TANYA

-- within the trap It is part-plant part glass
or crystallized light She tries to pry apart a
tangle of rootsbars

Through the glass we see MORDO advancing on STRANGE --

ANGLE ON MORDO
-- increasing the ENERGY BLAST as STRANGE retreats

DORMAMMU
Thats better Mordo On Get on

MORDO howls like a pack of wolves
and emits steam like a boiler
ANGLE ON STRANGE

-- backtracking building up new inner energy walls
as MORDOs rays shatter the outer ones

Sweat pours down STRANGEs furrowed brow
The struggle against MORDO - who is so copiously
helped by DORMAMMU - is taxing DOC greatly

SUDDENLY --

HILLTOP EXTERIOR DAY

STRANGE finds himself standing on a hilitop
overlooking a green plain a line of volcanoes
and an endless white beach lined with palms

STRANGE looks around He listens
The only sound is the waves on the shore and
the cry of birds

CUT BACK TO --

THE DARK DIMENSION
-- where STRANGE is still duelling with MORDO

STRANGE clears his head and throws a new mental assault
at MORDO -- his ASTRAL FORM materializes to MORDOs
left -- while he continues to do battle in his animated
physical way --

MORDO is momentarily freaked and a wave of
multicoloured energy bowls him over

DORMAMMU catches onto STRANGEs trick

DORMAMMU
Its not his Astral Form Mordo
Its merely a projection
The frightened MORDO continues to shower BOLTS OF LIGHT
at the image DORMAMMU sighs and makes it disappear

Instantly DOCTOR STRANGE encircles MORDO with the
RINGS OF RAGADORR --

HILLTOP EXTERIOR DAY

DOCTOR STRANGE surveys the plain with all its

diverse plant and animal life Deer graze from fruit
trees mountain lions prowl big iguanas sun themselves
in the dunes The sky is full of swallows and circling
eagles

DOERMAMMU appears man-size at STRANGEs side

DORMAMMU
Beautiful isnt it
See the whales off shore

ANGLE ON A MAGNIFICENT HERD OF GREY WHALES
STRANGE breathes the fresh air and nods

STRANGE
Very nice yes

DORMAMMU
(taking him into his confidence)
This is what Earth would be like
if there were no people

BIG ANGLE ON DORMAMMU

DORMAMMU
Think about it

BACK IN THE DARK DIMENSION

DORMAMMU leans back in his crystal chair
He stares at a MINIATURE PLANET floating
before him all green and white and blue

BELOW HIM the battle royale between STRANGE
and MORDO rages — But his attention is on
his tiny simalbcrum of Earth

DORMAMMU
Mankind is an abomination
He despoils everything he touches
His only instinct is to destroy

ANGLE ON DORMAMMUS TINY PLANET

-- as we watch black industrial smoke trails appear
The deserts swell The forests disappear

DORMAMMU
I know Im evil Strange But you
humans are worse than me because
you wont face up to the truth --

The MINIATURE WORLD turns brown Its oceans dry up
Its blue atmosphere vanishes DORMAMMU emits

a fiery breath which finishes off the planet
consumes the tiny planet

DORMAMMU
The human race is the most
destructive force in the
Known Universe

STRANGE battles fiercely with MORDO who has snapped
the Crimson Bands and retaliated with a thousand
rounds of PSYCHIC ENERGY

DORMAMMU
Help me destroy it Stephen
Youll be thanked by every
other living thing

STRANGE
Bullshit Dormmammu Nobody
thinks that but YOU
Your heads been on fire i
long you fried your brains

ANGLE ON TANYA

-- within the trap No longer struggling
she concentrates her energy and starts to levitate --

GOTHIC CATHEDRAL INTERIOR DAY

The miniature Earth emerges green and whole again
from a font of holy water STRANGE stands beside it
in humble clothes DORMAMMU stands next to him
dressed like a Mediaeval Devil

They stare at the perfect globe of Earth

STRANGE
There is a spark faint though
it may be --

On the tiny planet we see the trails of smoke and spirals
of pollution DISAPPEAR

STRANGE
-- a gleaming spark of divinity
glowing within each of us

The CATHEDRAL WALL comes crashing down
and MORDO storms in like an express train

MORDO
ILL SMASH YOU
ILL SMASH YOU

THE DARK DIMENSION

MORDO roars bestially as a flood of energy streams into
him from DORMAMMU He hurls white ANVILS OF LIGHT
at STRANGE hammering him back --

ANGLE ON TANYA

-- returning from her meditative state and opening
her eyes to see --

-- HER REFLECTION in the glass of the prison
It wears the feathered gold bejewelled head-dress
and embroidered bustier of an EGYPTIAN SORCERER-QUEEN

TANYA
Nefertiti

BABYLON FIFTH CENTURY BC

DR STRANGE wears the square-cut beard and high-
collared purple cloak of a Byzantine Emperor

He reclines on thick cushions attended by ADMIRING
FEMALES and fanned by PORTLY EUNUCHS
HIS POV --

The steps below him are crowded with BOWING SUBJECTS
bearing GIFTS Beyond them is the Avenue of the Gods

with Temples on one side and Hanging Gardens on the other

The Avenue is packed with MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
all of them bringing gold slaves jewelry and every kind
of TRIBUTE for STEPHEN STRANGE

DORMAMMU appears at his side smoking a cigar

DORMAMMU
Mordos poor company Stephen
Id much prefer to have you
running things for me on Earth

THE DARK DIMENSION

ANGLE ON STRANGE as MORDOS RAYS crash through his
defences He backs up shouting

STRANGE
NOOOOO

MORDO advances laughing DORMAMMUS DEMONS scream
their support from the bleachers

Suddenly STRANGE drops all his defences
and ducks below MORDOS BARRAGE

In the absence of an opposing force MORDO misses his
footing He stumbles --

-- and instantly STRANGE is on top of him pinning his
arms and legs with four blasts of light from the
EYE AMULET --

MORDO yells and curses but is trapped
STRANGE grabs hold of MORDOs head --

DORMAMMU
Excellent Strange
Now finish him

STRANGE sees a vision of himself smashing MORDOs
head against the ground greenyellow blood splattering

STRANGE lets MORDO go unharmed

ANGLE ON THE CRYSTAL TRAP

-- shattering TANYA drifts gently down to
the platform beside DOCTOR STRANGE

ANGLE ON DORMAMMU
-- shaking his head in wonder

DORMAMMU
I have to hand it to you
Sorcerer You won the bet
(disgusted)
Won it fair and square too
Be gone the pair of you

STRANGE
I should extract a vow from you
A promise never to return to Earth

A wind blows through the Dark Dimension
Giant blue cactuses appear

DORMAMMU
Impudent human Get out of here
before I change my mind

STRANGE looks DORMAMMU up and down Right now they seem
to be about the same size STRANGE nods stiffly

STRANGE
Well OK Goodbye
STRANGE turns and with TANYA at his side starts walking

up the cactus-lined pathway They can feel DORMAMMUs
breath upon their necks

TANYA
Doc somethings wrong

STRANGE
We have to trust him
He gave us his word
ANGLE ON DORMAMMU

-- looking up and beckoning to something

ANGLE ON MOLOCH THE DESTROYER

-- hurtling like a DIVE BOMBER towards STRANGE and TANYA
screeching a MALIGN INCANTATION --

ANGLE ON TANYA
-- swinging around to face the DEMON
Suddenly she is clad as NEFERTITI the sorcerer-queen

TANYA
Imanaqtintaq
Khaynaniraq
Machasquari
PURIMUNKI

WHITE LIGHT pours from TANYAs outstretched arms
filling the giant room MOLOCH collides with

the barrier of light and EXPLODES

WIDE ANGLE ON THE THRONE ROOM

TWO POWERFUL SPELLS one TANYAs the other DORMAMMUs
crash together building a blinding wall of

ENERGY and LIGHT

The WHITE LIGHT spreads till it obscures everything --
DORMAMMU - MORDO - TANYA - DOCTOR STRANGE --

WHITE OUT

HIGHWAY EXTERIOR DUSK

DR STRANGE and TANYA materialize on foot in the fast lane
They run for the central divider It is the RUSH HOUR

TRAFFIC rolls by on both sides

STRANGE
Where on earth -

TANYA
Long Island Expressway

It is almost the LI Expressway
but there is something wrong

Everything - the cars the sky the highway is grey
and slightly blurred The cars are moving in slow motion

STRANGE
We havent made it back yet

Were in between the Dimensions
Stuck

YELLOW HEADLIGHTS wash over them
AN OLD RAGTOP approaches

Seized by a premonition TANYA grips STRANGEs arm

The CAR is an old dark two-door with a ripped-up black top
It pulls off the road and stops beside them
in the diamond lane The DRIVER winds his window down

Itis KANDELL

STRANGE
Master

KANDELL opens the passenger door STRANGE takes a
step towards the car KANDELL waves him away

KANDELL
Nefertiti Wayquey Ahkenaten

TANYA lets go of STRANGEs arm
She walks towards the car
KANDELL holds the door open

STRANGE
Master I dont understand --

KANDELL
She knows who she is now Stephen
She doesnt belong here any more

STRANGE
But Master --

TANYA
Hes right Stephen There are
things for me to do Things Id
forgotten all about

STRANGE is desolated But his stern code and the
presence of his MASTERS SPIRIT FORM prevent him from speaking

TANYA stares at STRANGE intently Her eyes glow

TANYA
I was in darkness for a long time
Doc You brought me out of it
(she kisses him)
Thank you
STRANGE
(choking)
Ill see you later
TANYA
Sooner than you think
Goodbye
He reaches for her TANYA gets into the car
He is unsurprised to see the Rag Top turn into a pair of
BLACK WINGS which carry the old Ford out of the traffic
jam and away

And suddenly STRANGE is on --

THE REAL LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY EXTERIOR DUSK

-- beside the central divider with LOUD TRUCKS
and TRAFFIC rushing by He is alone

He lowers his head and starts walking towards the
skyline of Manhattan

BLEEKER STREET EXTERIOR DAY SUNSET
A TAXI deposits DOC outside his place

The drawing room window is still boarded up
and the House has a melancholy air

Nailed to the door is a court order saying
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit

STRANGE digs in his pockets for his keys
The TWO VICE COPS appear
COP 1
Okay ya weird freak

Youre goin’ downtown

STRANGE casts a baleful eye over the COPS
Both stop in their tracks

STRANGE
You are both hungry for donuts
Go and eat them Do not

bother Doctor Strange again

He makes a mystic gesture
The COPS immediately turn their backs on him

COP 1
Im HUNGRY man You HUNGRY

COP 2
Yeah Lets grab some DONUTS

The TWO COPS head across the street for Winchells

WONG opens the front door

He wears a deer-stalker hat and is carrying a SUITCASE

and a SET OF GOLF CLUBS

STRANGE
Wong Where are you going

WONG
On vacation boss

(shakes his hand warmly)
Good work Welcome back
Must pay electric bill at once
or cut off Very bad

WONG heads down the steps and hails a TAXI

WONG

Wheres the yeung lady at
STRANGE

She had pressing business
WONG

Good
(gets into CAB)
Maybe she press your Cloak

The TAXI rolls away
STRANGE enters his House

HALLWAY INTERIOR SUNSET

STRANGE throws his dusty Cloak over the stair rail
Pinned to the bannister are various bills

There are two electric bills with red borders

There are also lots of notes saying Call Agent

STUDY INTERIOR NIGHT
DR STRANGE enters his Study

He takes the Book of the Vishanti from its lectern
locks it and the EYE of AGAMOTTO in the safe

The RECORD Tanya gave him is still sitting on the sofa
in its bag

STRANGE picks up the old RECORD and walks over to

the stereo He switches it on Puts the RECORD on
the turntable starts switching on the lights --

Suddenly the POWER is cut off and the lights go out
The stereo dies

STRANGE sits down on the sofa
He examines the record cover in the fading light

Written on it in what looks like lipstick
are the words SOONER THAN YOU THINK

He stares at the writing

Then though the room lights remain extinguished
his Stereo returns to life

’ The needle drops and Link Wrays Fallin Rain
begins to play

STRANGE relaxes comfortable in the dark
