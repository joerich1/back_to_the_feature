INT NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY
COLE is twelve years old and losing his mind
He stands with his back against the wall hands raised

COLE
I don’t need it I’m telling you

The SCHOOL NURSE is not convinced And also not happy
SCHOOL NURSE
Cole Just because you don’t feel
sick right now doesn’t mean you
don’t need the shot
COLE
I never get sick So you can take
that-—
He points to the DISPOSABLE SYRINGE she’s holding
COLE (CONTD)
And give it to Barry His nose is
always running-

SCHOOL NURSE
There’s nothing to be scared of

Cole freezes
COLE
I am not scared
INT BOY’S STALL - TWO MINUTES LATER

Cole tries his best not to cry while he inspects the little
band-aid on his arm

His best is not good enough

He’s in that perfectly awkward stage between being a cute kid
and a handsome teen

SOME ASSHOLE bangs on his stall door-
Cole jumps hard-

SOME ASSHOLE (0S)
PUSSSSAYYYY

And the asshole walks out of the bathroom laughing
EXT SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

Cole is waiting for the school bus beside MELANIE another
twelve year old Also his neighbor

Also definitely not a potential love interest for Cole so
whoever told you that is an idiot and a liar and loser and a-

MELANTE
Did you know that only one baby was
born on the Mayflower How crazy is
that shit His name was literally
Oceanus He didn’t even have a
nationality He was a citizen of
the sea I guess

COLE
What class did you learn that in

MELANIE
No one learns anything in class
Cole That’s why we have the
internet

A new SUV pulls up and Melanie waves to her ANNOYING DAD

MELANIE (CONTD)
We just got it It’s pretty sweet
Has DVDs in the back and like a
million horse power

COLE
Cool

She climbs into the passenger seat

MELANIE
Dad can we give Cole a ride too

MELANIE’S ANNOYING DAD
Cole are your parents expecting
you to take the bus

COLE
(shrugs)
I guess so

Melanie’s Annoying Dad shrugs back annoyingly
MELANIE’S ANNOYING DAD

Then you gotta take the bus sport
Sorry about that
COLE
I didn’t even ask to-

They start pulling away Melanie waves bye and-

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
Cole walks home alone from the bus stop

He turns around when the familiar sound of bicycles emerge
from behind him THREE KIDS on bikes

He hates these jerks but what are you gonna do

JEREMY is the leader He’s fourteen So he’s cool as shit
Don’t even worry about his friend’s names They’re not
important because they’re not Jeremy

JEREMY
Colenoscopy How’s it hanging

COLE
I dunno Okay

JEREMY
Speaking of hanging have your
balls dropped yet

No-name Kids cackle Cole mumbles something

JEREMY (CONTD)
Sorry man I didn’t catch that

COLE
I said why are you so interested in
my balls

One of the other bikers slaps Cole upside the head He was
expecting that

JEREMY
Dude the last thing I care about
is balls On Saturday I hooked up
with Shelly MacEntyre

COLE
--The sophomore

JEREMY
The sophomore But in many ways
she was a senior
COLE
I don’t believe you

Cole gets smacked upside the head by a different biker

JEREMY
It doesn’t matter if you believe
me It’s not like your belief in me
will validate what happened to my
dick Ya wanna know how it was

COLE
(kinda)
No not really

JEREMY
I won’t lie As a fourteen year
old in that kind of situation with
a sixteen year old that looks like
Shelly MacEntyre it was
overwhelming I mean she’s a
woman Fully Developed I really
had to focus so as not to
disappoint ya know what I’m
saying

The other bikers apparently know what he’s saying Cole’s not
quite sure so he doesn’t say anything

JEREMY (CONTD)
I said do you know what I’m saying

COLE
I guess

Jeremy blocks Cole’s path with his bike

JEREMY
I guess isn’t good enough I feel
like you’re doubting me and I find
that insulting

COLE
But you just said it didn’t matter
if I believed you-

JEREMY
I changed my mind bitch

Cole stares at his shoes sheepishly

COLE
Jeremy I’m not trying to insul-
Jeremy suddenly pushes Cole in the chest

He falls on his ass his palms catching the road He winces
as-

Jeremy and his friends laugh until-
A BLUE JEEP stops near them

GIRLS VOICE
Hey

From the ground Cole stares up as-

THE GIRL blocks out the sun for a moment as she squares off
with Jeremy staring down at his pimply little face

THE GIRL
Did you just touch Cole

JEREMY
(acting tough)
(scared though)
So what if I did

She turns him around real fast reading his sewn in name tag
on his back pack She’s maybe a full foot taller than Jeremy

THE GIRL
Jeremy Check it out

The Girl raises up her keys and starts flicking through them
THE GIRL (CONTD)
You so much as think about Cole

again I will-

She leans in and whispers for a very long time to Jeremy His
expression goes from cocky-

To nervous—
To terrified
THE GIRL (CONTD)
(out loud)
And then I’m going to burn your
house down Cool
With a pointy key she stabs his bike tire popping it
THE GIRL (CONTD)

Now get out of here before I run
you over you little pap smear

Jeremy obeys trying to ride his flat-tired bike the no-name
kids close behind

In the middle of the street The Girl sits beside Cole

THE GIRL (CONTD)
Hey Coley

COLE
Hey Bee

Now is a good time for you to know that as far as Cole is

concerned

God made women and then God made BEE

She is a knock out senior who actually listens to him when he

talks

She is better than STAR WARS

BEE
You skin your palms

COLE
It doesn’t hurt

BEE
Yes it does C’mere

She grabs his hand and tenderly picks out some of the gravel

He shrugs

BEE (CONT’D)
They bother you a lot

BEE (CONT’D)

Ya gotta just punch ‘em in the
dick Don’t hit them in the face
cuz then if you leave a mark their
parents are gonna call your parents
and it’s just the worst And if
they’re chasing you wait until
they’ve almost got you Then drop
like a bag of rocks And then when
they trip over you and are on the
ground kick ‘em in the dick

She finishes his hand Smiles at him

COLE
Can I help you burn down his house
BEE
Like I would ever do that without
you

INT BEE’S JEEP - DAY
Bee is laughing The windows are down The radio is up

BEE
The sophomore

COLE
That’s what he said

BEE

Screw that guy The closest he’s
come to getting laid is HBO The
closest she’s come is a tampon
Also she’s totally gay And I
don’t mean that disparagingly I
mean she dates chicks So don’t
worry about it

Cole smiles to himself no longer worrying about it What Bee
says is God’s gospel after all

BEE (CONT’D)
How the folks

COLE
Better I think

BEE
Hotel therapy is working That’s
great for all of us They stay
happy we get to hang out I get
paid

COLE
I’m like your little prostitute

Bee bursts out laughing

BEE
What

COLE
Like I have to pay you to hang out
with me

Bee laughs harder
BEE
No that would make me a
prostitute And your parents the
client That’s a terrible analogy
That’s maybe the worst one ever

Cole is embarrassed

COLE
Oh I’m sorry

Bee notices and smiles

BEE
Besides I’d hang out with you
either way

COLE
Really

BEE
One hundred percent I got maybe
two years tops before you’re too
cool to hang out with me

COLE
That’s not true You’1ll be in
college by then

BEE
Whatever You’1ll still be too cool

Cole smiles and looks out the window

COLE
Ill never be too cool

EXT COLE’S HOME - DAY

Bee’s blue jeep pulls up outside Cole’s home It’s a cute two
bedroom place in a neighborhood full of them

BEE
Tomorrow night You Me Party
Cults will be formed over nights
like the night we will have

COLE
Sounds good

They reach their pointer fingers out to each other ET
Poster style They make electric buzzing noises when they
touch
BEE
See ya Cee

COLE
Ba-bye Bee

She drives off and Cole heads into his house-

As Melanie and her Annoying Dad pull up to the house next
door

INT COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

No one seems to be home Cole walks through the living room
passing the stairs that lead to the second floor

He goes into the kitchen where a note is taped to a fridge
that says

IN THE CRAWL SPACE
AGGGGHHH

Cole scrunches up his face

INT GARAGE - DAY

Cole chews a fruit roll-up as he makes his way through their
cluttered garage that dad always promises to clean and never
does

EXT THE HOME’S CRAWL SPACE - DAY

Cole’s MOM is under the crawl space beneath their house The
small gate unscrewed and put off to the side

Cole hands her mouse traps which he hears her setting

COLE
Do you like it under there

MOM
(laughs)
No Cole I don’t like it under
here It’s pretty much the worst

COLE
Thennnnnnn why are you under there

MOM
Well sometimes being a grown up
means doing things that suck

COLE
Thennnnn why isn’t Dad under there

A different kind of laugh from Mom

MOM
He says he doesn’t fit under here

Cole surveys the opening It definitely looks like he could
fit under there

MOM (CONTD)

Buuuuut it’s really because he’s
scared That or he really doesn’t
care if we get rats Which I guess
is possib-

COLE
Do you think I’m a pussy Mom

Mom has no reaction for a moment

MOM
Do you know what that word means
Cole

COLE

Like afraid of everything

MOM

Um I think you’re at a time in
your life where a lot of things are
scary And as you get older those
things will stop frightening you as
much

She pulls herself out of the crawl space Her face is a
little dirty There are webs in her hair

MOM (CONT’D)
How do I look

COLE
Like a crappy haunted house
character

MOM
Like the warm up creeps they have
outside before you actually get in

COLE
Pretty much

She picks up a power drill from him and starts drilling the
gate back over the space

MOM
Get me a drink buddy

He nods and starts to walk away But stops
COLE
Mom I know a pussy is also a

vagina I’m not retarded

MOM
Cole Don’t say retarded

COLE
But I can say pussy or vagina

She laughs

MOM
Lemonade

He smiles and moseys into the home

INT DAD’S CAR - NIGHT

They are in a mall parking lot It’s after hours so
completely empty

Cole is in the driver’s seat DAD in the passenger

DAD
How them windows looking

COLE
Looking good

DAD
Roger that Radio distracting

COLE
It’s not on

DAD
Then it’s distracting

He turns it on Looks for the perfect sound track for his
son’s driving lesson

DAD (CONTD)
Parking brake

COLE
Nope

DAD
Hands

COLE

Ten and two
Dad holds up a Picard hand

DAD
Engage

And Cole begins to drive around the empty lot He loves it
going all of twenty miles an hour

COLE
Are you and mom going to get a
divorce

Dad stops trying to find the perfect song and looks at Cole

DAD
You waited until you started to
drive to ask that question

COLE
If I don’t like the answer I’11l
just drive us into the
Bloomingdales

DAD
At least drive us into JC Penney
It’s so much cheaper

COLE
You don’t get a say I’m behind the
wheel I have the power

DAD
I’ve created a monster Multiple
times over And no we’re not
getting a divorce

COLE
Then why do you keep going away
together for the weekends

DAD
(sighs)
Marriage takes a lot of work And
sometimes routine can be I don’t
know Your mom likes hotels
(MORE )

DAD (CONTD)
You know what it is Marriage is a
fire and you gotta ya know keep
it going And sometimes the weather
changes and you’re like aw crap
it’s raining And you just gotta
work harder so the fire doesn’t go
out Make sense

Cole shrugs The answer is no

COLE
What do you even do there

DAD

At the hotels Oh Huh We go out
to eat Sometimes they have spas
Your mom likes musicals so I pay
my dues

(then)
Besides you get to hang out with
Bee I can’t wait until you’re
thirty and we can talk about how
lucky you are

(then)
Do kids make fun of you for still
having a baby sitter

COLE
Yeah

DAD
I’m sorry You know we don’t have
to call her that-

COLE
But then they see her and they get
really jealous

DAD
Hell yeah they do

Dad raises a hand for a high five Cole lets go of the wheel
to hit it

The car swerves Dad grabs the wheel in a panic

They laugh It’s a good night

INT PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cole walks into his parent’s room to find them watching TV
Mom is working on bills Dad is watching

They’re not really connected

COLE
What’re you watching

MOM
Mad Men You wouldn’t like it

COLE
It’s on HBO

Mom tries not to laugh
DAD
Nah it’s not dirty It’s just
dense It would go over your head
We’ll rewatch it together in a few
years

COLE
Oh Alright

Cole stands there awkwardly

MOM
Need anything buddy

Cole shrugs and moseys on back to his room

INT COLE’S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Cole’s bedroom is your typical twelve year old’s bedroom
Movie posters Monsters toys YA books

His window overlooks the woods and Melanie’s house next door

He sits on his bed with a hand-me-down laptop He watches a
stream of Mad Men

He pays more attention than any twelve year old has ever paid
to Mad Men He will unlock the secrets of-
INT COLE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Cole wakes up Laptop slumped beside him on the bed out of
battery He tries grinding the sleep from his eyes

He’s learned nothing

INT SCHOOL BUS - MORNING
Cole sits beside Melanie on the way to school

COLE
So I think they go to have sex but
it just makes me feel like they go
to get away from me

MELANTE
They are definitely having sex But
they probably have sex when you’re
at home too

COLE
They don’t They just watch TV

MELANIE
Hotels have TVs

Cole had never thought of this

COLE
I never thought of that

MELANTE
Besides I bet Bee has boys over at
your place all the time Doing it

This makes Cole much more uncomfortable than the previous
topic

COLE
No way Not a chance

MELANTE
Dude that’s what babysitters do
They put the kids down sneak their
boyfriends in Doing it I mean
seriously have you ever been awake
after she’s fallen asleep

Cole thinks about this The answer is NOPE

MELANIE (CONTD)
Did you hear that Jeremy told
everyone that she threatened to cut
his mom’s throat and force feed him
her spleen

Cole is blank for a moment

COLE
That’s the best thing I’ve ever
heard

MELANIE

I know right

EXT SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Cole eats a sandwich by the school gate Across the street is
the high school

He glances up and sees Bee with a group of fellow students

Even from across the street Cole can see that her head is
suspiciously resting on a NERDY GUY’S SHOULDER

Cole tries to mask how much this upsets him

DAD (VO)
Oh my Goddddd

INT COLE’S HOME - DAY

Dad anxiously waits by the door as Mom parks and heads
inside Cole watches TV behind him

DAD
We said we were gonna leave at
five didn’t we

COLE
Please don’t involve me

DAD
It’s almost five thirty This is
the problem

Mom walks in Sees Dad’s WTF face

MOM
Uh oh

DAD
Five thirty

MOM
So

DAD

We were supposed to leave at five

MOM
Six
DAD
Five
MOM
If we were leaving at five where’s
Bee

Bee is nowhere Dad notices this Sighs
MOM (CONTD)
Well this trip’s off to a great
start

The door bell rings

INT COLE’S HOME - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Cole hurries to the door Before he opens it smooths out his
hair and-

Opens the door to reveal BEE

BEE
WHAT UP DAWG

COLE
WHAT UP GEE

They do their ET Finger move and Bee comes in
Mom and Dad bustle out ready to leave

MOM
Hiya Bee

BEE
Hi Mrs Johnson Mr Johnson
Where you guys heading tonight

DAD
It’s a surprise

MOM
The Hyatt

DAD

Oh Well there will be more
surprises

MOM
Probably not You guys be good

BEE
Oh we will

Mom kisses Cole’s head goodbye He hates it

MOM
Bye buddy

COLE
Bye Mom

Dad holds out his hand for a manly handshake Cole hates it
DAD
Remember son you’re the man of the
house Protect her from all

enemies

COLE
Okay Dad

Mom and Dad walk out to the car They get in Bee and Cole
wait by the door

Mom and Dad drive off Beeping a few times Cole and Bee look
at each other

IT’S ON BITCHES

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
DOUGH PIZZA SAUCE PEPPERS ALL THE MEATS ALL THE CHEESES
COOKING
BEE
So you’re basically saying
intergalactic dream team
COLE

Yeah so like there’s an epic
villain right And using time

travel-
BEE
From Terminator or Star Trek
COLE
Terminator’s not intergalactic Not
yet anyway

(MORE)
COLE (CONTD)
But it’s science fiction so you can
make your own rules up

BEE
That makes sense

COLE
So using time travel you have to
fill a starship full of the best
people or aliens or robots to take
down the villain

Bee contemplates

BEE
How many seats do I have
COLE
Five
BEE
Five
COLE

Fine six if you need like a duo
And you can’t have like Predator
and the Xenomorph together because
they’d fight and the mission would
be futile

BEE
No I get it Hmm

She counts out her squad

BEE (CONTD)
One Kirk Two Picard Three Will
Smith and Jeff Goldblum from
Independence Day Five Ripley and
six are you ready for this shit A
xenomorph egg so here’s the plan
Kirk and Picard team up to captain-

COLE
Why do you need both

BEE
Because a girl’s got needs They
team up to get us to the big bad
because you know he’d have like
obstacles

COLE
Probably

BEE
Then when they get close they send
Goldblum and Will to get inside the
lair They have experience with
that

COLE
Fair

BEE
Now this whole time Ripley’s been
bitching about the Xenomorph egg
and shit cuz that’s her move But
she knows she’s gotta do this
because it’s the only way to save
the world

COLE
The universe

BEE
Yes So Will and Goldblum get her
inside Ripley personally drops off
the egg the facehugger attacks the
big bad Ripley makes it back to
Goldblum and Will the big bad
attacks they narrrrrrowly escape
Kirk and Picard supply cover as the
scout craft returns home they
peace out of there then the big
bad starts feeling like shit and-

She shoves her hand through the inside of her shirt chest-
burster style

BEE (CONT’D)
He’s out

COLE
Who said he was a he

BEE
Shut up A woman just saved the
galaxy

COLE

Are facehuggers female
Bee contemplates this too
BEE

I don’t think so right cuz they
got dicks

COLE
So you’re saying it took a dick to
save the galaxy

Bee stares at him

BEE
I wanna do over

COLE
No do overs

BEE
Aliens don’t abide by our primitive
gender stereotypes

COLE
What’s done is done

BEE
You suck You suck and I hope you
die

COLE

You couldn’t live without me

BEE
It would definitely effect my
income So you’re probably right

The oven dings

PIZZA TIME

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bee and Cole are watching an R-rated movie that he’s probably
not allowed to watch Cole sits close to Bee pretending he’s
not as scared as he is

COLE
Do you think my parents are gonna
get a divorce

BEE
I don’t know man I hope not

COLE
Melanie’s parents got divorced Now
her mom lives with her boyfriend
BEE
Gross That’s the cute chick next
door right

COLE
Mrs Dryer is not cute She’s
gross Her boyfriend’s like twenty-

BEE
Not her Melanie

A brief pause

COLE
I wouldn’t say she’s cute

BEE
I would I would say she is
extremely super duper cute

COLE
I know what you’re trying to do
and it’s not gonna work

BEE
Whatever You want your tongues to
touch

COLE
No I don’t

BEE
Yes you do

COLE
Nope No way

BEE
Youre in denial

COLE
Youre in asshole

Bee laughs

BEE
That was great

COLE
Thanks

BEE

But you’ll be okay if they break
up It happens This is America
(MORE)
BEE (CONTD)
Shit stinks You can’t trust anyone
you love to be there for you for
the rest of your lives Unless you
die really young In which case you
got a better shot

COLE
Do you ever think about how like
when I’m fifty technology will
probably have advanced and I could
like download my brain into a
super robot and live forever

BEE
I think about you at fifty becoming
a super immortal robot literally
all of the time

Bee sees the time

She looks

Bee tries to determine what he might want to drink

BEE (CONTD)
Shit dude it’s late

COLE
I’m not tired

BEE
I know you’re not but I am

at him

BEE (CONTD)
If I give you a shot will you go
to sleep

COLE
A shot of what

BEE
Vvvvvvooooooginnnnnnrrummmabbbbbbss

Cole can’t help but agree

BEE (CONT’D)
You my man I’ll be right back You
wanna clean up

COLE
No

BEE
Thanks babe

She skips away to the kitchen leaving Cole He smiles and
walks over to close the blinds when-

He looks outside the window and sees-

Across the street-

A CAR PARKED

But full of people He can’t make out much more than that
He eyes them for a moment the wheels in his head turning-
When Bee returns with a shot glass yawning

BEE (CONT’D)
Here you are my good sir

He takes it She holds on

BEE (CONT’D)
And remember you don’t say a word
of this to your parents Ever Even
when youre a fifty year old super
immortal robot

COLE
My dad lets me drink Mike’s all the
time

BEE

I’m sure he does
She smiles and skips back to the kitchen

BEE (CONT’D)
One sec

Cole has this one moment

He stares at the Baileys

And suddenly DUMPS IT in a nearby plant
Bee returns with a shot glass Bummed

BEE (CONTD)
You drank it without me

Cole shrugs Trying to be cool

COLE

Sorry
MELANIE (VO)
Shes totally getting LAID

INT COLE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cole is facetiming with Melanie
COLE
I’m gonna find out

MELANIE
Youre such a little perv watching

people do it

COLE
I am not a perv I just wanna know

what happens after I go to sleep

MELANTE
Way to throw away the whiskey They

give that stuff to babies to knock

them out
COLE
I never said it was whiskey
MELANIE
Then what was it

COLE
-Stronger shit

He hears Bee coming up the steps
COLE (CONT’D)

I gotta go

He closes the laptop unceremoniously as Bee knocks
COLE (CONT’D)
Speak friend and enter

BEE (0S)
(Ian McKellan voice)

MELONNN
She pushes the door open and enters checking out the room as

if it were the Mines of Moria

Cole laughs and Bee smiles Sits on his desk She’s wearing
short shorts and Cole’s eyes flicker to her legs

This is not lost on her

BEE (CONT’D)
Feeling bout ready for bed

COLE
Yeah I’m-
(big yawn)
Really tired

BEE
It’s the Baileys man Like a
gentler ambien

COLE
What’s an ambien

BEE
Adult candy You need anything

Cole shakes his head and wraps himself up in blankets

BEE (CONTD)
Cool Night dude

CO1E
Bee

BEE
Yup

Cole slightly worried the love of his life will soon know
the touch of a different obviously lesser man chooses his
words with care

COLE
Thanks for knowing me and
treating me like I was okay

She leans against the door frame

BEE
You don’t think you’re okay

Cole shrugs

COLE
I feel weird most of the time

BEE
Well I like weird all of the time
And I’m hot so if I like it
imagine how all the girls will like
you when you’re a senior
Cole can’t help but blush

COLE
See you in the morning

BEE
Good night

She winks at him and turns off the light
When Cole hears her walk downstairs he sits up

IT’S ON

FIVE MINUTES GO BY

Cole is playing a game on his cellphone in the dark Music
off He hears Bee moving stuff around downstairs and listens

FIFTEEN MINUTES GO BY
And he hears the soft steps of someone coming up the stairs

He pockets his phone under the covers and pretends to be
asleep as-

Bee checks on him She says nothing

She walks into the room and looks closer at him He seems to
be conked out

Satisfied she leaves
Cole opens his eyes That was definitely a little weird
TWENTY MINUTES GO BY
And Cole listens as Bee greets HER FRIENDS at the door

Most confusing of all though is the fact that they’re not
whispering They’re talking in their normal voices

Clearly not afraid they could wake Cole up

He texts Melanie

COLE
Theyre here Theres a bunch of
people

MELANIE

omfg orgieeeee

Cole’s not sure what that word means He tosses the phone on
the bed and creeps closer to the door to eavesdrop

The voices are still muffled There are definitely boys

Cole creeps his door open just a touch He can hear a little
better

Oddly it sounds like everyone is walking on plastic
MAN (0S)

So the Spocker is the live long and
prosper hands doing the good work

Everyone downstairs laughs

NERD (0S)
And they like that

MAN (0S)
The nasty ones do Bee knows what
Im talking about

Cole hears a peck on the cheek His eyes go wide
BEE (0S)
Dont pay attention to Max And
dont ever ever do that to me
Everyone laughs
NERD (0S)
(nervously)
It was I was never thinking of

doing that to you

BEE (0S)
Or anyone

NERD (0S)
Or anyone

CHEERLEADER (0S)
Im boorrrrred lets draaaank

The group cheer and proceed to probably go do shots

Cole closes the door and rushes back to his phone He texts

COLE
Theyre talking about Star Trek

MELANIE
Thats really disappointing
You should go down there
Film them
Cole scrunches up his face

COLE
Perv

MELANIE
Lol

Cole puts the phone in his pocket and goes back to the door
He opens it a crack-
They are back in the living room

So he sneaks out the door

INT UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Cole gets down to his hands and knees and peers over the
second floor balcony-

Where he sees THEM sitting in a circle in the living room
There are SIX of them including BEE

MAX The Man Dreadlocks Football Fast Five

ALLISON Pixie School paper Network

JOHN THE BAPTIST Preacher kid White boy Chariots of Fire

SONYA Peppy Cheerleader Beauty and the Beast (not the
Disney one the French one you know with oh nevermind)

And finally
SAMUEL The Nerd Doesn’t fit in Especially with these guys
Which is weird considering Cole’s pretty sure this is the

guy Bee had her head resting on earlier Upstream Color

The entire living room floor is covered in PLASTIC WRAP

The group sit around passing a bottle of liquor and laughing
and generally being teenagers
A bottle sits in the middle of them And naturally-
That bottle is spinning

It points at MAX (0000000000h) -

ALLISON
Truth or dare

MAX
Truth me

ALLISON

Who would you want to sleep with
the most here

MAX
Sonya

The group laugh and cheer Except for the nerdy kid who just
kinda sits there awkwardly

JOHN THE BAPTIST
You didn’t even have to think for
that

This is all the most fascinating thing that Cole has ever
seen

The bottle gets spun again and-
Lands on BEE

MAX
Truth or dare

Bee stares straight at Samuel

BEE
Dare

MAX
Make out

Bee smiles leans forward but-
Poor Samuel stands up

SAMUEL
I’m I’m sorry this is kinda weird-
Bee stands up too

MAX
Stop being a pussy Sam

SAMUEL
I’m not I just it’s weird with
all you guys staring-

BEE
Sam

He looks at Bee now standing in front of him

BEE (CONT’D)
Just close your eyes Pretend
they’re not here

SAMUEL
Closing my eyes doesn’t mean
they’re not here

BEE
Do you trust me

After a moment he nods She wraps her arms around his neck

BEE (CONT’D)
Then don’t stress Just relax This
is fun This is not weird Okay
He reluctantly agrees

SAMUEL
Okay

BEE
C’mere

She kisses him

And Cole’s heart breaks He can’t look away Try

But wait

As they kiss Max and John hand something to Bee

She takes it behind Samuel’s head and Cole sees-

That she has TWO KNIVES IN HER HANDS

Which she plunges into Samuel’s poor skull

as he might-

Cole slams back against the wall in terror

He doesn’t know what to do His hands shake His mouth hangs
open He doesn’t understand-

BEE (CONT’D)
Shhh Shhh It’s alright

Cole forces his shaking body to peer down again-

Samuel’s body is trembling He keeps trying to breathe but
can’t seem to exhale

Only inhales
He stares at Bee with understandably confused eyes

His body goes slack but Bee holds him up with the knives in
his head

BEE (CONT’D)
Shhh Just let go

SONYA
(sings)
Let it go-

BEE
Shut up Sonya Show some respect

Bee looks back at the almost-dead Samuel
She smiles
BEE (CONT’D)
You are helping fulfil a great
purpose Know this
Samuel stutters
SAMUEL
--I don’t wanna be a great
porpoise-

And with that said his eyes fade out

And he dies being held up by the knives sticking out of his
head held by the last girl he’1ll ever kiss

Cole’s brain is exploding a million times a second

MAX
Did he say porpoise

JOHN THE BAPTIST
I think he did
MAX
(laughs)
That’s so shitty

BEE
He didn’t even get to understand

She says this kind of sadly

Sonya and John have two urns They hold them up by the
knives

Max wraps his arms around Samuel’s chest

BEE (CONT’D)
Ready

SONYA
Ready ready

With a gross squelch Bee pulls the knives from his head
His leg twitches as she does as-

Blood slowly leaks out on Sonya’s side while-

A small geyser shoots John in the face

JOHN THE BAPTIST

Gasdfgasdfg
MAX
Oh shit
BEE

Don’t laugh John relax

John closes his eyes and mouth obediently but still freaks
out internally

Bee pushes his hands up so the urn starts collecting the
blood instead of his face

BEE (CONT’D)
There you go

He exhales

ALLISON
You look like Carrie
JOHN THE BAPTIST
Allison what are you even doing I
forgot you were here

ALLISON
I’m documenting it

JOHN THE BAPTIST
With what

ALLISON
My brain I’m obviously not going
to write down a live account of how
we sacrificed Samuel

JOHN THE BAPTIST
Well clever you get me a paper
towel and wipe sacrificed Samuel
out of my darn eye

Allison gets up to get the paper towels-

BEE
Don’t throw them out Take them
home burn and then bury them

ALLISON
Bury them where

BEE
I don’t care It’s tradition so
probably in the earth

Allison stomps into the kitchen-
ALLISON

Great so I’m just gonna carry
bloody rags around

MAX
No different than usual for you
then

SONYA
Oh snap

The group laughs Except Allison
And except Cole who is literally trembling
And not part of their group

YET

BEE
Bring me the case
The group suddenly become VERY EXCITED
Like quiet excited

Sonya hurries out of sight and returns with a RED METAL
SUITCASE

She hands it carefully to Bee who undoes a combination and
opens it-

A BROWN LEATHER JOURNAL sits protected inside
Some of the group gasp
Cole doesn’t get it

BEE (CONT’D)
Oh calm down

But she barely means it as she gently picks the book up out
of the case

SONYA
Is that really it

BEE
Yeah it’s really it

John the Baptist peers over Bee’s shoulder as she opens it
up

JOHN THE BAPTIST
What language is that

BEE

The best language Alrighty babes
Let’s get started Take his blood
into the kitchen and we’ll get
lil’man’s next

SHIT

Time to go

Cole looks up to his bedroom door

Takes a few very deep breaths

And starts to slowly crawl inside

INT COLE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cole very very very very gently closes the door-

And dashes for his phone

He ignores all the texts from Melanie and goes straight for-

He waits anxiously as it rings

Through his window we see a light come on at the house next
door and see Melanie eagerly trying to get his attention-

Wanting the scoop on all the sex she presumes is happening-

Until she sees how utterly terrified he is And becomes
utterly terrified herself

911 (CONT’D)
911 what is your emergency

He speaks very softly

COLE
Hi my name is Cole Johnson and
aaa guy was just murdered in my
living room He uh the address is
2455 Bigby Drive Can can you
please send someone

Youre doing great Cole Can you
speak a little louder

Cole shakes his head

911 (CONTD)
Cole are you shaking your head

COLE
Yyes

Thats okay Were sending some
help over right now Can you answer
some more questions for me

He nods
911 (CONTD)
Okay I can guess youre nodding so
Ill continue Was the victim a
family member

COLE
No he was a high school student
boyfriend person

And the attacker is still in the
house

COLE
Yes They are downstairs and having
a blast

How many are there Cole
Cole tries to remember
COLE
Too many Can you get my mom She’s
at the Hyatt in the city

Of course Cole Now listen to me

Its important that you stay hidden-

COLE
What if they come for me

Then dont-

A DING goes off in Cole’s twelve year old head

COLE
I gotta protect myself Thanks

Nonono-

He hangs up the phone and takes a deep breath
Scans the room

Quietly as he can he begins searching the room for
something

In drawers

Under the bed

Behind books
Until-

He finds it-

THE POCKET KNIFE

He opens it up quickly and tests it for sharpness on his
finger

It barely breaks the skin
His cellphone rings back silently 911
He answers it

COLE
I found a knife

And hangs up again
He quickly throws on a pair of jeans Socks Shoes
Pockets the knife in his pocket

Then goes over to the window He pushes it open as quietly as
he can

Melanie opens her window as well

MELANTE
WHAT’S GOING ON

COLE
(FREAKING OUT)
SHHHHH
She gets it
MELANIE

(silently subtitled)
WHAT’S GOING ON

Cole doesn’t answer her He looks out the window-
It’s a long way down

FUCK

Cole looks up at Melanie

She moves her arm up and down LADDER
He looks around his room

And that’s when-

Cole hears a bunch of FEET ON THE STAIRS

He looks at Melanie waving her away from the window
He throws the curtains closed and-

And dives on top of the bed

He roles over so he is facing the wall-

Pulls the blanket over him so his jeans and shoes aren’t
visible as-

Bee Max Sonya and Allison enter the room
Again they don’t particularly talk quietly

SONYA
Ohmagod this room is ADORABLE

BEE
He’s so cute You have no idea

Max flips through some of Cole’s books
MAX
Oh man Jules Verne I read some of
this shit
ALLISON
(whispers )
Won’t he hear us
BEE
With the amount of drugs I gave
him Haillll no

And this might be the most heartbreaking moment of the
evening so far for Cole

He faces the wall his big eyes darting around
Bee sits on the bed Cole does his best not to tense
He closes his eyes lightly

BEE (CONT’D)

He’s been my biggest project I’ve
been watching him for two years

MAX
Damn girl That’s some sadistic
shit

BEE

It’s not sadistic It’s an honor
She turns back to the others

BEE (CONT’D)
Do you have the needle

COLE’S EYES GO WIDE THE FUCK OPEN

SONYA
Yup

She hands Bee a small box Bee opens it and pulls out the
container

And from that container-
Pulls out the HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S A SYRINGE

Cole is doing his very very very best to not have a full
blown panic attack

And to keep pretending to be asleep
He tries not to tense up-

But-—

It’s-

Really-

Fucking-

Hard-

Bee pets his head with her free hand
His eye closest to her is shut-

But the other is freaking the hell out-
It would leave his skull if it could
And then BEE-

PLUNGES THE SYRINGE INTO HIS ARM-

Cole’s teeth grit as hard as they can as he stops breathing-

Trying his best not to give himself away as-
Bee takes a vial of his blood and then-
She twists it off-
Replacing it with a SECOND VIAL
Which quickly fills up
AND THEN A THIRD
And A FOURTH
MAX

Ya know there’s a faster way to
get all that blood

BEE
You know what happens when you kill
someone

MAX
They die

BEE

They STOP MAKING MORE BLOOD So
this is basically a faucet for us

SONYA
What about Samuel

Bee sighs the way you sigh when someone’s being a fucking
idiot
BEE
Sonya you have a listening
problem

Bee ties off the fourth and puts it carefully in the
container

She then slowly leans down to his arm-

And kisses the pinprick wound

She leaves her lips there for a long second
Before whispering as if he could hear her

BEE (CONT’D)
Good boy

As she stands to leave the room she sees the curtain
flapping lightly in the breeze

She pauses fixing her eyes on it
Wondering was that window open before
And does it even matter

She shrugs it off and heads for the door with the others
And in bed Cole waits

He hears the door open

And the door shut

And the feet on the stairs

And he waits until they are all downstairs
And then slowly exhales

He quietly crawls out of bed

He pulls off the sheet

Carries it to his desk by the window

He does not notice Bee watching him

She is crouched by the door watching him with absolutely
expression

Cole exhales throws open the curtains

No Melanie in the other window yet

He kneels and ties one end of the sheets to the desk leg
Bee watches

Cole finishes the knot Tries it a few times

Bee watches

He stands up and throws the sheet out the window

He peers out to see how far down it goes

Not far enough but it can work

He shakes out his hands trying to psych himself up

no

And that’s when he starts to get a little light headed
He blinks rapidly-

Reaches out for the desk-

Misses-—

Falls to the floor-

Out cold

BLACK

INT THE LIVING ROOM - 14 MINUTES LATER
Cole wakes up
The situation is well totally fucked

He quickly discovers that he’s tied to a chair His hands in
rope behind his back

The gang of high-schoolers all watch him
Including Bee
But Cole’s mostly focused on MAX

Because Max is pacing back and forth stretching his arms in
front of him

Shirtless
So Cole asks the obvious

COLE
Why is he shirtless

JOHN THE BAPTIST
That’s your first question

SONYA
How can you even ask that Look at
him

Max stretches out his arms so Cole can look at his chiseled
body

COLE
I still don’t get it-

BEE
Give him a cookie
Cole looks at Bee Her eyes burn into him
But he holds her gaze

Sonya walks towards him with some cookies She holds it in
front of his mouth

COLE
-No thank you

SONYA
Eat the cookie

COLE
You eat the cookie

Sonya replies by taking a big bite out of the cookie
Chewing
Swallowing

She opens her mouth in front of his face so he can see that
she really did swallow

SONYA
Now eat it

COLE
--I just don’t really like
cookies Bee knows that
Everyone looks at Bee
She sighs He’s right But
BEE
Youll feel better if you eat the
cookie

Cole doesn’t respond

BEE (CONTD)
You fainted Cole

Some of the group laugh Cole tries his best to not let on
that the cool kids laughing at him hurts his feelings

His best is not good enough

COLE
No I didn’t
BEE
Yes you did I know this because
after I took four vials of blood
from you I waited in the room
because something felt off I
crouched by the door and a few
seconds later you got up tied a
sheet to the desk threw the sheet
out the window And fainted So
Your blood sugar is low eat the
cookie Please
She says all of this fairly monotonously
But Cole can’t help feel like-

COLE
Are you mad at me

BEE
Cook Key

Cole reluctantly looks at Sonya
And opens his mouth
She lacklusterly shoves it in there
And walks back to the others
Max keeps pacing
Cole keeps chewing
He swallows
COLE
I probably can’t ask for a
drink right

BEE
Why are you awake Cole

His eyes go back to Bee

COLE
I couldn’t sleep

BEE
Mhmm
COLE
Mhmm

Cole fidgets nervously in the chair
His fingers reaching for his back pocket
POCKET KNIFE BITCHES

BEE
I don’t believe you

COLE
Well I don’t believe this So

BEE
Touché

COLE
Thanks

BEE

Wanna try again
HE OPENS THE KNIFE BITCHES
COLE

Okay okay fine I was gonna go
I was gonna go smoke in the woods

BEE
You were gonna go smoke in the
woods

COLE

Yeah Like ya know Marijuana

Bee raises an eyebrow

BEE
You smoke pot

COLE
Yeah Of course

The group silently stare at him
COLE (CONT’D)
Okay jeeze it was gonna be my

first time smoking pot

BEE
Why didn’t you drink the Baileys

HE STARTS CUTTING THEM ROPES BITCHES

COLE
Why is he shirtless

BEE
Cole

Again it’s almost painful for Cole to look her way

COLE
Why’d you take my blood

BEE
Why are you still lying to me

COLE
Why am I tied up

BEE
Why didn’t you drink the Baileys

COLE
I don’t like Baileys I only drink
it because I wanted you to think I
was cool so I don’t know why do
you give a twelve year old alcohol

BEE
Because I put shit in that alcohol
that should make them konk out for
a solid eight hours what else did
you see

COLE
I just see you And these assholes
who I don’t know in my house

Cole looks at them At blood-stained John

COLE (CONT’D)
Why is that dude covered in blood

JOHN THE BAPTIST
BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD LET ME BORROW
A SHIRT

COLE
THAT’S NOT EVEN AN ANSWER

ALLISON
Does he not realize there’s a
mirror behind him

Cole freezes and realizes

Everyone can see him trying to cut the ropes because of
decorative mirror on the living room wall behind him

BEE
Well he does now

Cole doesn’t know what to do
So he gives them the finger
And keeps cutting

BEE (CONT’D)
Why are you cutting the ropes

COLE
Because I don’t like being tied up

BEE
Why do you have a pocket knife

COLE
It was a gift

BEE
You know what I mean

COLE
I don’t know anything

Bee looks at Max
He smiles
Steps towards Cole

Cole starts cutting the rope faster

SONYA
I love that he’s still cutting the
rope

COLE
Youre not you’re not gonna hit
me

MAX
No

COLE

How do you explain that to a kid’s
parents huh

the

BEE
Dude how do we explain any of this
to your parents

COLE
I won’t say anything You know me
I’m really good with secrets I
won’t tell my parents that you were
having an orgy and needed my blood
to do it

The whole group burst out laughing Even Bee can’t help but
smile

This really hurts Cole

ALLISON
Do you even know what an orgy is

COLE
I’m guessing it’s something sad
people do because they want other
sad people to like them and they
can forget for a few minutes how
sad they are in general

The group don’t respond at first

JOHN THE BAPTIST
That’s actually a solid answer

They look to Bee

BEE

It was for a science project okay
COLE

The orgy
BEE

The blood An orgy is when a bunch
of people all have sex together We
probably wouldn’t need your blood
for that

COLE
You coulda just asked

Bee looks at him
COLE (CONTD)

I woulda let you have some blood
for science
Bee smiles Kinda moved by this

BEE
I knew you were scared of needles

And that’s when the familiar lights of a COP CAR
through the curtains outside

Everyone looks towards them
Including Cole
Who starts cutting way faster

BEE (CONT’D)
Cole Why is there a cop car

outside
COLE
I I don’t know-
BEE

Did you call them

COLE
No You said you were in the room

BEE
Which makes me think you were awake
before then Which makes me think
you saw something that scared you
enough to call the cops Right
Cole stares at her

And she is angry

BEE (CONTD)
Right Answer me

He flinches when she raises her voice at him

illuminate

Stares at her with his broken twelve year old heart-

His watery eyes blink
And he becomes a fucking ANGRY twelve year old
He scrunches up his face and screams

COLE
HELP HELP I’M TIED UP INSIDE

The room freaks out as-
The cops begin banging on the door
COLE (CONTD)
THERE ARE FIVE HIGH SCHOOLERS AND
THEY ARE PROBABLY ARMED THEIR
NAMES ARE BEE-
Max KICKS Cole in the chest-

His chair goes backwards and-

COLE (CONTD)
OOF

BREAKS

Cole remains on the floor out of the way as-
Two cops KICK OPEN THE DOOR-

Guns raised as-

JOHN THE BAPTIST THROWS A FIRE POKER AT A COP-

It strikes him dead in the face throwing him back out the

door-
His gun FIRES-
Hitting ALLISON
LIVING COP

HOLY SHIT-
When Bee steps up from behind the cop and calmly-
Cuts his throat
And he drops to the ground
Dead
OBVIOUSLY
Cole watches in terror from the floor

COLE
OH MY GOD YOU KILLED THEM

BEE
Your fault bro

COLE
WHAT ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND

Allison starts SOBBING

ALLISON
He he shot me in the boob

The group all sprint over to their friend
Cole watches slowly getting his hands free of the ropes as-

ALLISON (CONTD)
They weren’t even finished growing

BEE
Aw hunny they were totally
finished

ALLISON
It really hurts Ahh

JOHN THE BAPTIST
Should we call an ambulance

BEE
ALLISON
NO MY BOOB
BEE
Your boob was shot by a now dead
cop Have fun explaining that
They have for the moment forgotten about Cole
So this is his moment
They are huddled around Allison to his left

The stairs to his right

He eyes the front door beside them

The crumpled bodies of the two cops blocking it
So the stairs seem like the only option

All their backs turned to him as they argue how to best
extract a bullet from a breast

So Cole GOES FOR IT
SLOW MOTION BITCHES

As Cole launches himself from the ground-

For the stairs-—

It takes the group a minute to realize as he-
Leaps over the dead cops-

Crashing onto the stairs

The group freak out-—

John’s first off the mark-

Sprinting to catch up-

But Cole is already scrambling up the stairs
He spots John coming after him

Closing-

Knows he can’t make it too far before he’s caught-
Cole reaches the tops of the stairs-

Turns right and-

Stops—

Turns-—

John’s almost at the top of the steps when-
COLE SCREAMS-—

CHARGES -—

HANDS OUT-

HEAD DOWN-

AND PUSHES JOHN THE BAPTIST-

RIGHT THE FUCK OVER THE BANNISTER

Everyone downstairs looks up

Cole looks down

John The Baptist flails in the air and-

SMACKS INTO THE WOODEN FLOOR
He does not move again
Everyone is still for a moment-
Until they look away from John-
And up to Cole

He looks straight at Bee

She looks straight at Cole

And she is not happy

BEE (CONTD)
Get him

Cole glares at her-
And sprints away
He hears the others give chase-

But doesn’t have time to stop

INT COLE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cole runs into his room-

Throws the door closed and locks it

Kicks and pushes anything he can in front of it and-
Goes to the desk

The sheet still out the window

Cole grabs hold of the sheet and gets on top of the desk
He takes a deep breath and-

Goes out the window

EXT COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

He begins scaling down the house when he hears others break
into his room

He knows he’s gotta go quick

He starts moving faster as-

The sheet is PULLED UP SUDDENLY
The surprise jerks Cole-

He slips and slides down the sheet-

COLE
AHHHH-

He grasps and-

GRABS THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET

His weight brings the sheet back down hard and-
There’s a shout from upstairs as they lose hold
He’s about six feet from the ground

GOOD ENOUGH

He lets go and tumbles to the ground

The woods in the backyard

He starts heading for them when-

He hears the back door swing open-

FUCK THAT

He turns and runs back towards the front

To the garage

He grabs the handle and-

IT’S OPEN

INT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Cole runs inside-

Smacks the garage door opener-

But instead of running outside he slides under his dad’s car
He’s small so he makes it under there before-

MAX explodes into the garage and-

Seeing the garage door almost fully opened-
Assumes Cole went that way and-

Runs out of the garage

Cole remains motionless for a second before-
Quietly-

Slowly-

Crawling off the ground

He gets to his feet and comes face to face with-
SAMUEL

Dead eyes and blood stained head

Cole almost screams but stops himself

He stares at this poor nerdy kid

It kills him

He tears himself away and-

Surveys the garage quickly

What is here that he can use

He looks in cabinets and boxes for anything
A large can of BUGSPRAY

Squeezes that into his back pocket

A LIGHTER

He flicks it a few times to see if it works
Eventually a flame

Pockets it

An old BLANKET

Wraps it around his shoulders

His Dad’s POWERDRILL

Wields it heroically

And finally he sees something that makes the twelve year old
very very excited because of how very very wrong this is
An OLD FIREWORK
He digs it out of a box carefully
Holds it like a precious Indiana Jones artefact

COLE
Hell yeah

In giant block letters and with a chorus of angels singing
the words the words slam on the screen

HELL
YEAH

SHIT SOMEONE’S COMING
No time to celebrate finding a firework
Cole’s plan is hatched and-

He runs back outside the garage

EXT CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT

Cole slides down the back yard to the CRAWL SPACE where-
He quickly unscrews the first screw-

The second-

He hears someone coming-

The third-

Almost there-

The fourth-

He drops the screw

No time to search in the dark-

He pulls the gate off and drags it and the old blanket-

INT THE CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
INSIDE with him

He shines his iphone light carefully so he avoids the MOUSE
TRAPS his mother set earlier

He makes his way deeper inside while-
He hears someone outside the crawl space

He reaches the back wall and quickly covers himself with the
blanket

And waits as-
SONYA peers inside
SONYA

Are you shitting me with this tomb
raider crap

MAX (0S)
Dibs on the forest Have fun baby
girl

SONYA

I hope you get impaled And
disemboweled I hope both

Max laughs off screen as Sonya begins crawling her way
inside the crawl space

SONYA (CONT’D)
You better not be in here Cole My
manicure cost twenty bucks

But Cole does not answer Instead he waits

He watches through the thin blanket Laying low to the ground
when-

A dark shadow passes over the blanket and as he focuses on it
he realizes

It’s a really really big SPIDER

He freezes This complicates things as Sonya crawls closer
and closer

It crawls down over his blanketed face slowly

S-1l-o-w-l-y-

Cole doesn’t breathe as Sonya gets closer

And closer

When she flashes her iPhone light towards him-

All she sees is a big-ass spider crawling over an old
blanket

She shivers

SONYA (CONTD)
This is such bullshit

She begins to try and turn herself around and-
Trembling Cole reaches back and-

Pulls out the FIREWORK

He quietly pokes it out from underneath the blanket-
Aiming it directly at her

The spider keeps crawling down the blanket-

And then onto the firework

Cole regards this with twelve year old fascination
As he pulls out the lighter

Takes a deep breath and-

Flick Flick Flick

SPARK

Sonya hears it

Turns her head back and sees the tiny flame of the lighter
Grins

SONYA (CONT’D)
There you are

And the firework lights
She doesn’t realize what she’s looking at until-

IT FIRES

SHOOTING STRAIGHT AT HER
She shrieks as it BLASTS past her

She goes down on her stomach screaming as it ricochets with
a loud BOOM in the small crawl space

Cole seizes her distraction to crawl as fast as he can out of
the crawl space

As he passes Sonya-

She sees him-

Reaches out to grab his ankle when-
SNAP

SONYA (CONTD)
AIIT

Sonya lifts her hand which has been caught in the mouse
trap

Freaked out she scrambles in pain and-
SNAP
She screams again as her other hand hits another mouse trap
SONYA (CONT’D)
I’M GOING TO KILL YOU YOU LITTLE
SHIT

The firework comes to a stop as-

EXT CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS
Cole quickly begins screwing the screws back on the fence
One screw-
She’s crawling towards him quickly-
Two screws—
SONYA
We’re going to hang you upside down
and watch your blood leak out of

your eye sockets

Three screws

Cole searches the ground for the fourth as Sonya is almost
there-
HE FINDS IT
Screws it in as-
BANG
She begins hitting the fence Pushing it Breaking it
He screws it all the way in and-

SONYA (CONT’D)
And then we’re gonna-

COLE
Shut up

He holds out the giant can of bug spray right at her face and-
SPRAYS

She screams and tries to get out of the blast-

Coughing harder and harder-

We hear more

SNAP SNAP

Of mouse traps and her subsequent gasps as-—

She can’t breathe-

Cole screams as he unloads the entire can into the crawl
space until-

Sonya is quiet And there is no movement inside
Triumphantly Cole sits back gathering his breath
He almost smiles

He stands up only to reveal-

MAX

Standing a few yards behind him

Cole slowly turns around and looks at the Quarterback

MAX
Did you just lock Sonya under there
and spray an entire can of bug
poison in her face

COLE
-No

MAX
I mean I’m not even mad That’s
just so messed up What was the
loud banging sound

COLE
a firework

Max bursts out laughing

MAX
Oh shit Oh shit That’s horrible

And then he pulls the knife out of the back of his pants
(BTW still shirtless)

MAX (CONTD)
So you want like a head start

Cole’s shoulders slump

COLE
C’mon man you’re the quarterback

MAX
Life’s not fair dude

COLE
You guys suck

MAX
You just Auschwitzed our friend

COLE
What does that mean

MAX
Like the gas chambers from World
War 2 Haven’t they taught you that
shit ye-
Cole CHUCKS THE BUG SPRAY at Max’s face-

Clocking him dead in the forehead

MAX (CONTD)
Son of a bitch
And by the time he’s done rubbing his head-
Cole has already started sprinting towards the trees

Max grins and gives chase as if his college football career
depended on it

It takes him barely three seconds to catch up to the twelve
year old

Cole knows he won’t make it-

He sees the trees coming-

Hears Max right behind him-

And when Max stretches out his free hand to grab Cole-
Cole DROPS like a bag of rocks

Wrapping his head in his arms and hitting the ground so-
Max TRIPS over his body hard-

FLYING FORWARD-

Sending Cole tumbling as Max-

HITS A TREE TRUNK FACE FIRST

Cole stumbles to his feet and watches Max slide grossly down
the tree with his face-

Until he finally rolls over-

Revealing all the ways Max will never be photogenic ever
again

Max groans lightly missing teeth and swollen eyes and a
smashed nose as-

Cole quietly picks up the knife
He stands over the quarterback victorious
COLE
Of course I know what Auschwitz
was I’m not retarded you pussy

Your joke was in poor taste

He angrily KICKS Max in the dick Max groans
Cole waits a moment and then just because tonight is
horseshit-

Kicks him in the dick again

And that’s when a BULLET rips out bark from the tree
Cole

Cole drops to the ground

COLE (CONTD)
OH SHIT

He looks towards the house but-
Can’t see anyone
He whines to himself

COLE (CONT’D)
Why are there gunssss-

VOICE (0S)
COLE

Cole looks up and sees-

MELANIE

At her back door waving him over

Cole waits for a moment-

Looking at his house-

Before he starts crawling soldier-style to her when-
ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT

COLE
GAH

He gets to his feet and full on runs to Melanie-
Diving through the door-

Landing ON TOP OF HER

He kicks the door closed with his foot

Melanie looks up at him

Cole looks down at her

such

beside

Embarrassment ensues

He roles off and catches his breath
(I’m so sorry for that line)
Everything they say is a WHISPER

MELANTE
WHAT IS GOING ON

COLE
I got the white boy the shirtless
guy and the asian girl I don’t
know their names The glasses girl
got shot in the boob So I think
it’s just Bee-

MELANTE
WHAT IS GOING ON

He looks at her Realizes she didn’t see what he saw
COLE
High school kids are bad Murdered
the geek Took my blood Tied me
up Killed the cops-

He remembers

COLE (CONT’D)
The cops

He gets to his knees and runs to their front window

All he sees is Melanie’s Dumb Dad’s Dumb SUV in their
driveway

But he can see enough to tell that the cop car is NO LONGER
in his driveway

COLE (CONT’D)
What the hell

ar)

MELANIE
Cole

Cole turns and sees Melanie behind him Shaking

MELANIE (CONTD)
Youre really freaking me out

COLE
I’m I’m sorry
MELANIE
Bee is bad

Cole thinks on this

COLE
Yeah Bee is bad

MELANIE
And we we can’t call the
cops

COLE

I did that And now they’re dead

MELANTE
Shit
(then)
Should I get my dad

Cole sighs
COLE
Melanie no offense but your dad

is kind of a prick

Melanie can’t help but agree

MELANIE
That’s true I just what do we
do

COLE
Pray

MELANIE
Okay

COLE
I was kidding

MELANIE
Oh

COLE

But it’s probably a great idea-
When Cole sees a SHADOW come over the window
Cole grabs Melanie and pushes her down to the ground
MELANIE

We keep getting on the floor
together-
COLE
SHH

Cole waits

Nothing

Until-

The front door knob turns
Locked

MELANTE
OH MY GOD

COLE
Come on

Cole grabs her hand-

IT’S A MOMENT

And leads her back to the kitchen where they-
Hide behind the island

MELANTE
Do you think she can get in here

COLE
Not if it’s locked-

The door creaks open behind them
They look at each other
MELANTE
(silent subtitled)
We shoulda prayed
Cole nods
They wait
They hear very soft footsteps
One after the other
Coming deeper into Melanie’s home

They wait

Pressed against the island

Melanie looks to Cole for guidance

AND HE STEPS UP TO THE TASK

As the steps come closer on their left-

Cole leads Melanie silently around the island-

Timed so when the intruder rounds the island they are on the
side

Cole slowly slowly slowly peaks and-
He can’t tell who it is-
Because they’re walking towards them OH SHIT-

Cole scrambles as quietly as he can pushing Melanie the
other direction

She crawls and he waits there ready to spring and fight or
do something really stupid when-

The legs beside him stop-

Cole holds his breath-

For what seems like forever
Until the figure turns-

And goes back the way it came
Cole quickly grabs Melanie and-

They round the island until they are back where they started
as-

The figure walks down a hallway to investigate the rooms down
there

COLE
Well We’re back

Melanie nods

MELANIE
Now what

Cole looks out the back door
COLE

I shouldn’t have gotten you into
this

MELANIE
You were being shot at

COLE
Especially because I was being shot
at You’re my best friend and I’m
sorry I’m gonna take care of this
He moves to go out the back door but Melanie holds him back

MELANIE
Are you crazy

Cole looks at her simply

COLE
I’ve had a really bad night

Suddenly Melanie grabs his neck and KISSES HIM on the lips
REALLY GODDAMN HARD
Cole keeps his eyes open the whole time
When the kiss ends Cole tells her the truth
COLE (CONT’D)
The last boy I saw get kissed got
stabbed in the head By two knives
MELANTE

Just because she’s a psychopath
doesn’t mean women are evil

COLE
I know that

He turns to the door
COLE (CONT’D)
It just means high school is gonna
suck ass
He quietly opens it when-
He notices THE SUV KEYS sitting on the counter
He looks back at Melanie and POCKETS THEM
She nods approving
COLE (CONTD)

Make sure she can’t see you when
she comes back
Melanie nods
And then Cole kinda blushes

COLE (CONTD)
I’m really excited we kissed

Melanie beams

MELANIE
Let’s make out next time

This might be the scariest part of Cole’s night

He awkwardly nods and runs out the door

EXT MELANIE’S HOUSE COLE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As he runs as fast as he can he bangs on the side of
Melanie’s house

COLE
AHHHHHHH COME GET ME DICKHEADS
AHHHHHHHH

He gets back to the garage and-

EXT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Enters the side door Notices that Samuel is GONE
Cole is disgusted

COLE
Sick sons of bitches

And heads slowly into the house-

INT COLE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

The lights are all off as Cole enters the kitchen where-
On the table-

A very bizarre STONE SCULPTURE sits

The size of a desktop computer

It has TUNNELS looping every which way inside

It doesn’t look Mayan or Egyptian or Satanic

It just looks WEIRD

Cole gets a closer look and sees that-
There are entry points in it

Covered by strange SYMBOLS

He touches them softly with his finger to confirm his
suspicions

BLOOD

COLE
Ewwww

He wipes it off on his jeans and notices-
THAT LEATHER JOURNAL

Up close Old as hell

He turns the pages and-

Those same damn symbols again

No English

Illustrations of the SCULPTURE

A manual

But what it does is anyone’s guess

Not giving a shit that it’s crazy old he rolls it up and
shoves it in the back of his pants-

A HAND GRABS COLE’S LEG FROM UNDER THE TABLE
It pulls Cole down and he goes crashing to the floor where-
ALLISON AWAITS

She looks as terrible as you think a girl that got shot in
the boob would look

ALLISON
C’mere you little shit-

COLE
AHHHH

She crawls on top of him hitting him with both hands-

He covers his face from the blows-

ALLISON
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU’VE
DONE

Cole looks up at her through his guard-
Sees her blood stained top and-
Begins PUNCHING HER BOOB OVER AND OVER

She shrieks in agony and falls backwards as Cole scrambles
away

ALLISON (CONT’D)
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU You’re so
gross you pervert

COLE
What Screw you You can’t make me
feel bad that I defended myself

Allison holds her boob and starts to cry

ALLISON
I feel so abused You molested me

COLE
--WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL
ME

ALLISON
I WASN’T TRYING TO KILL YOU BY
TOUCHING YOUR DICK

COLE
THIS IS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE

ALLISON
BUT I AM GOING TO KILL YOU

She starts pushing away the chairs she was hiding under-

Giving Cole just enough time to dive into the kitchen
cabinets

He throws porcelain wedding gift plates at her-
Crystal wedding gift wine glasses-
Everything

But she really doesn’t give a shit anymore
He dives into the kitchen drawers and pulls out-
Not a knife but-
A long candle lighter
He flicks it on and the flame is disappointingly small
Allison rises to her feet-
Clutching the shard of a plate and-
Begins walking towards him
ALLISON (CONTD)
You think fire scares me My breast
is ruined My life is basically
over
COLE
That’s a really shallow way of
looking at the world
She stops

ALLISON
What

COLE
I mean you’re still super hot And
like what are you majoring in when
you get to college

ALLISON
Journalism

COLE
And smart So it’s like you’re
hot you’re smart obviously youre
driven I don’t know I could be
wrong but I think you won’t have a
hard time having a cool life

ALLISON

Wow you really think so
COLE

Totally I-
ALLISON

I DON’T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU’RE
SAYING YOU IDIOT

She rushes towards him with the shard and-
Cole closes his eyes and-

BAM

Allison SLAMS into
SHE’S BEEN SHOT IN
Her body slumps to
Staring at BEE

Bee tosses the gun

the kitchen cabinets violently as-
THE HEAD

the floor as Cole slowly looks up-

on the table and sighs

BEE

She was so annoying She never ever
did anything to help She probably
has a secret tumblr all about it
You know what it is She was the
kinda girl that still listens to
Smashing Pumpkins

She smirks at Cole

BEE (CONTD)

So tonight huh

Cole leans his head back against the cabinets

COLE

I want to throw up

BEE

You and me both Now I have to move
and shit Do the whole “new girl at
high school” for the hundredth
time You’ve really done a number

on us

COLE

Well You shot her

BEE

Her boob was ruined She wanted to
die Sonya

COLE
Crawlspace

BEE
Max

COLE

Woods Samuel’s body

BEE
Ditched it with the cop car

COLE
When

BEE
It’s like 5am bro We’ve been
doing this dance of ours for about
six hours

Cole can’t believe this He looks at the clock and what she
says is somehow true

COLE
Holy crap I thought it was all
continuous and in real time

BEE
That’s just the adrenaline

An awkward pause

COLE
So

BEE
Yeah So This is the part I’m not
really excited about

COLE
Are you gonna shoot me

BEE
No I was only shooting around you
because I was hoping you’d just put
your hands up and shit
She sighs

BEE (CONT’D)
Plus I’m out of bullets

COLE
Hooray

BEE
But I mean two cops are dead

She nods to Allison

BEE (CONT’D)
Couple high schoolers I gotta skip
town And that leaves you and what
to do with you Any suggestions
Cole is silent

Then-

COLE
What is that thing anyway

Bee looks at the weird stone sculpture-
And instantly notices-

BEE
Where is the-

She turns back to Cole-

To find him holding the book

So old

So weathered

So dry

And in his other hand he still holds the CANDLE LIGHTER
Its flame ready and hungry

Bee loses her breath

BEE (CONTD)
Cole listen to me

COLE
No

BEE
Cole listen to me-

COLE
NO BEE YOU LISTEN TO ME

She looks at him hands raised surprised at his outburst

COLE (CONT’D)
I have been hunted for I guess six
hours now You’ve stolen my blood
killed people shot at me and just
been general assholes all night
(MORE )
COLE (CONT’D)
So I wanna know what the hell is
going on

BEE
Cole Seriously You’re too young
to understand Trust me

Cole stares at her blankly for a moment

Before saying

COLE
FUCK YOU

BEE
Cole

COLE

No You deserved that What just
because I’m twelve means I get to
be treated like shit by you and
Jeremy and everyone else You know
what you are You’re you’re Don
Draper How he’s all cool and
handsome and everyone loves him and
then he goes home and you find out
he has a wife the whole time He’s
such a piece of shit How do people
even like that show

BEE
Dude I am so confused-

COLE
It’s from MAD MEN

BEE
--Did you just spoil MAD MEN for
me

COLE
It’s the first episode Youll
live

BEE

That’s so douchey

COLE
Really

Bee exhales

She
And

She

Bee

And

BEE
I guess fine in the grand scheme
of things tonight it’s not the
douchiest

COLE
What happens when you leave here

BEE
What do you mean

takes a step forward-
he swings the fire closer to the journal

backs up obediently

BEE (CONT’D)
Okay Okay

COLE

BEE

COLE
And youll leave here and just
find another faucet

BEE

COLE

She stretches her hands out to him

BEE (CONT’D)
You’re the best man and I’ve
been I’ve been bad to you But
what I do and what I believe it’s
powerful shit It’s holy I used to
feel so scared and so small until

She points to the sculpture

BEE (CONT’D)
And now I’m strong and I’m
confident And when I leave town

COLE

BEE

He thinks about it

BEE (CONT’D)
What do you say dude

COLE

He looks at her

COLE (CONT’D)
I guess I have a mission too

And he SETS THE BOOK ON FIRE
It goes up like a match

BEE
NOOoOO

Cole tosses it into the living room-
Bee runs for it and-

Cole runs out the back door

EXT COLE’S HOME - NIGHT

SLOW MOTION AGAIN BITCHES

Strong powerful and brave as fuck-

Cole Johnson runs around his house-

Towards the front yard-

And when he gets there-

He doesn’t go back into his house

He pulls out the keys to Melanie’s Dumb Dad’s Dumb SUV
AND UNLOCKS THAT SHIT

Gets inside

And slams that fucker closed

INT MELANIE’S DUMB DAD’S DUMB SUV - NIGHT

With the head lights off Cole slowly reverses out of the
drive way-

Straight back up the street

He does his best to angle the front of the car so it’s
directly facing his house

He sees Bee inside

Putting out the blazing book desperately

Cole closes his eyes-

Takes a deep breath-

And does his best to not let on how fucking terrified he is
HIS BEST IS MORE THAN GOOD ENOUGH

He opens his eyes CLEAR EYES

He exhales FULL HEARTS

He grips the wheel CAN’T LOSE

He SLAMS his foot on the gas

SCREAMS as the car surges towards the house as-
Bee looks up

Sees the car flying towards her

Sighs

The car SMASHES through the front of the house in a storm of
glass and rubble

The airbag HITS Cole full on as-

Bee goes flying as the SUV tears through the room-
Before coming to a stop

Debris falls from the ceiling as-

Cole coughs His whole body hurts

He pushes the airbag away and tries to look out the window-

It’s hard to see anything

Gingerly he opens the door and falls out of the SUV

INT THE RUINED ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cole stumbles with unsure footing through the rubble looking
for Bee until-

BEE (0S)
What up Cee

Cole looks down and sees Bee covered in rubble

He hesitantly walks over to her as she weakly pushes shit off
of her

She looks like well like she got hit by a car

COLE
What up Bee

BEE
You drove a car into your house I
really didn’t see that coming

She coughs disgustingly Lays back flat

BEE (CONT’D)
I think you broke my ribs

COLE
I’m sorry

BEE
It’s okay It happens
She looks at him

BEE (CONT’D)
You never told me your
intergalactic dream team

COLE
You didn’t ask

BEE
I should have I’m usually pretty
good about that stuff

Cole leans exhausted against the wall

COLE
Admiral Adama to lead it Data for
his intelligence and cool head
Predator to fight
(quieter)
Then me and you

Bee smiles

BEE
You didn’t say we could add
ourselves

COLE
It’s science fiction You can do
anything

BEE

I guess that’s true But don’t you
get it yet

He looks down at her

BEE (CONT’D)

You bring me on your trip because
I’m beautiful and I listen to you
and I make you think youre a
unique snowflake and an adult and
we get to the big bad’s lair and
suddenly you’re confused because no
one’s there “Where is he” you ask
me turning around to see me
smiling at you Here I am Cole The
big bad that you brought along for
the ride and that your parents paid
to be your friend

Cole processes this

COLE
I loved you

For a split second it seems to affect Bee But then it
vanishes

BEE
I don’t care

COLE
Yeah I think you do

Sirens can be heard coming in the distance

COLE (CONT’D)
I don’t care about your dumb book
or your creepy statue or your dead
languages I am an adult Because
when I realized you were the big
bad and betrayed me and were just
going to hurt other nice kids like
Samuel and Melanie I drove a
stolen SUV through you

Bee laughs Coughs again hard
BEE
That that I’1l give you
(then)
See ya Cee

Cole looks at her sadly

COLE
Goodbye

And does not reply as he has millions of times before

The cops pull up to the house and Cole slowly walks outside

EXT COLE’S HOME - NIGHT

It’s a strange sight an SUV smashed through the front of a
suburban home cops and ambulances rushing to the scene-

And a twelve year old boy who’s survived a war walking calmly
outside to greet them
LATER

Cole is sitting on the front yard facing the destroyed
house an insulation blanket wrapped around his shoulders

Melanie’s Dad is losing his unholy shit in the background
the cops

Melanie stares at Cole’s house like it’s the most amazing
painting she’s ever seen

One by one stretchers carry out the high-schoolers Max
Allison And Sonya And John the Baptist

A fireman approaches him
FIREMAN
You said there was another young
woman in the house too

Cole nods

FIREMAN (CONTD)
We didn’t find anyone kid-

COLE
My name is Cole

FIREMAN
Cole Sorry Are you sure there was
someone else in there

Cole stares straight ahead at the place

COLE
There was when I drove into it

The fireman doesn’t really know how to react to that as-
A car comes flying down the street-—

COLE’S PARENTS

to

And

They park and rush out of the car astonished at their house

desperate to find Cole

MOM
COLE COLE

Dad goes straight to the cops who point to his son sitting

alone in the front yard

Mom and Dad approach Cole quickly Mom grabs Dad’s hand
united in this moment

MOM (CONT’D)
Coley

DAD
Son

Cole turns around like it’s no big deal

COLE
I don’t need a sitter anymore

And with that said he turns back and faces the house he
destroyed and the night he defeated

And he fucking smiles

THE END
And now the opening scene from THE BABYSITTER 2

INT THE CLOSET - NIGHT
It is totally dark
And totally quiet

Totally that is except for the soft breathing

As your eyes get used to the darkness you realize you are

not alone here

A little girl TAMMY is hiding here
She does her best not to make a peep

She peeks through the closet doors and-

Sees THE SHAPE OF SOMEONE searching the room
Wielding a flashlight

Tammy holds her breath

As the person with the flashlight leaves the room
She exhales just a little-

AND THE PERSON CHARGES BACK INTO THE ROOM-
FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES-

THE CLOSET IS PULLED OPEN AS-

TAMMY SCREAMS AND-

INT THE KITCHEN - MORNING
A teapot whistles as-
MR AND MRS MORGAN return home from their night away

MR MORGAN
Tammy-baby We’re-

MRS MORGAN
(screaming)
OH MY GOD
She runs into the kitchen where-

Tammy is unconscious on a kitchen chair-

Tied up with a LOT of rope

VOICE (0S)
Uh-uh-uh
Mrs Morgan and her husband freeze and-
Slowly turn to see someone pouring themselves some tea
VOICE (CONT’D)
Id get you some tea but I’m
actually pretty pissed off with you
both So

She turns around and faces them revealing of course

BEE
No tea for you

FIVE MINUTES LATER

Bee sits beside the still sleeping Tammy while Mr and Ms
Morgan watch in terror

Bee slowly drinks her tea
Puts it back on her plate
BEE
Naw I’m just fucking with you I
dont drink tea
They continue staring at her in terror
BEE (CONT’D)
I just liked the idea of you guys
walking home a kettle going off
your little Regan MacNeil tied to a

chair and me drinking tea calmly

MR MORGAN
-Like Ronald Regan

Bee nonchalantly THROWS THE TEA CUP ACROSS THE ROOM
Where it shatters
Mr and Mrs Morgan jump in their seats
BEE
But I am not calm David and

Mallory am I

They shake their heads as if they were five years old
BEE (CONT’D)
I’m pretty far from calm I am
light years away from calm Because
I am so sick of this shit

She points at them

BEE (CONTD)
You had one job We agreed to this
In fact what did I say when I
sought you out

MR MORGAN
(whisper)
Nothing
BEE

Excuse me David

MR MORGAN
You said nothing

BEE
Why did I say nothing

MR MORGAN
Bebecause we sought you out and
asked you to help

Bee sits back in her chair satisfied

She slams

BEE
Ding ding ding So you can imagine
how super annoying it is when the
kid and I are hanging out the kid
goes to bed I go to do my thing
and-

forward-

BEE (CONTD)
You didn’t tell her to take the
pills I gave you

MRS MORGAN
We did tell her

BEE
Well then you’re a terrible parent
because now here you are here I
am angry and here is your
daughter

(MORE )

BEE (CONTD)
Should I wake her up and be like
mommy and daddy signed you up for
this so they could have happier

lives

MR MORGAN
No

MRS MORGAN
Please

Bee turns Tammy’s head so she’s facing her parents

BEE
Mommy why dont you love me enough
to not be completely happy just in
mothering me Why did you need to
call this attractive smart
dangerous girl and beg her to help
you in ways I never could because
I am a real Regan MacNeil

Mrs Morgan answers by staring at her lap and crying
Bee sighs

BEE (CONT’D)

You’11 tell her it was a nightmare
You’1ll tell her that she woke up
screaming and me being the
concerned lady I am called you and
you rushed home You’1ll have her
write me a cute apology card and
I’ll write her a cute one back
I‘1l put twenty bucks in it for a
movie and popcorn and youll take
her to something PG-13 so it’s
extra special When she asks why I
don’t babysit her anymore you’1l
say I have a boyfriend and am too
busy getting laid to babysit That
last part can be open to your own
creative license The rest cannot

Bee stands up
The Morgans stand up

Except for Tammy because she is tied up and asleep and a
real Regan MacNeil

BEE (CONT’D)
I think youll agree that our deal
is off No harm no foul and be
thankful for that
They nod like rebuked five year olds
BEE (CONT’D)
Groovy You can paypal me the money
you owe me for babysitting your
asswipe of a kid
Bee walks up to them They flinch
BEE (CONT’D)
She actually threw Beverly Cleary
books at me What the shit guys
Bee stares Mr and Mrs Morgan down hard
It’s terrifying

And then she smiles like everything is super

BEE (CONTD)
Ciao

And she walks chipper out of the house

When she closes the door Mrs Morgan breaks out into a sob
Mr Morgan looks to the heavens in thanks

And Tammy Morgan stirs awake realizing she’s tied up

TAMMY
Dad

MR MORGAN
YOURE HAVING A NIGHTMARE CLOSE
YOUR EYES

TAMMY
AHHH

Tammy scrunches her eyes closed praying for the nightmare to
end

IT NEVER WILL
