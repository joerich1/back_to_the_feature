INT AIRPLANE DAY

Isabel reaches up to put her suitcase inside the luggage
compartment and notices that SALGADO the 60-year-old man
witha grey beard sitting next to her is checking out her
cleavage

Salgado realizes that Isabel has noticed and he pretends to
want to help instead

SALGADO
Can you manage

ISABEL
Yes I’ve got it Thanks

Salgado turns his attention back to the book he is reading

ISABEL
Runway runway

After a moment of silence Isabel to be polite asks

ISABEL
What about you sir

SALGADO
Sir Oh my God

ISABEL
(laughing)
What’s wrong

SALGADO
With that “sir” you’ve sunk me
to a whole new low
(touching his bald spot)
I urgently need an implant

Isabel laughs again

SALGADO
I’m a music critic It sounds
terrible I know
ISABEL
Rock

SALGADO
Now you want to make me feel
younger No classical

ISABEL
My first boyfriend was a
classical musician I mean he
studied classical music

SALGADO
What was his name

ISABEL
You wouldn’t know him He sent
out a few pieces but I don’t
think his work was ever
published Is that how you say
it Or is it “edited”

SALGADO
You choose whatever term you
like and I’1l make sure everyone
in the music world starts using
it

ISABEL
(laughing again)
His name was Pasternak Gabriel
Pasternak

Salgado furrows his brow trying to remember Suddenly it
comes to him

SALGADO
Gabriel Pasternak If I had
known you knew him I would have
introduced myself as a
gravedigger He presented his
thesis at the conservatory when
I was heading the panel of
judges I ripped him apart

ISABEL
I was with him That was awful
After he read the review he
spent a week in bed

SALGADO
That’s the way it goes
sometimes I have to destroy
some poor guy’s self-esteem to
protect the ears of the
audience I may make a mistake
from time to time but what he
presented was really abominable
An aberration Are you still in
touch with him

ISABEL
No not at all Our relationship
didn’t end very well I still
think of him fondly though
he’s not a bad person

SALGADO
He may not be a bad person but
there must be a few bats in that
belfry for him to present a
piece like that ina
competition That’s right
Pasternak We were laughing
about it for months afterwards

ESTELA a woman sitting in the row in front of them

around

IGNACIO
Estela

ESTELA

Excuse me for interrupting but I
couldn’t help overhearing what
you were saying I simply can’t
believe the coincidence I agree
with your theory Sir I taught
Gabriel Pasternak in high school
and was given the daunting task
of telling Mam thatehe was going
to be held backspIn thirty years
of teaching I never saw
anything lake his reaction he
screamedyand cried like a baby

turns

a young man»sitting across the aisle gestures to

IGNACIO
Professor Simonetti
ESTELA
Yes
IGNACIO
It’s me Ignacio Avalos do you
remember
ESTELA

Oh my goodness This is
incredible Some sort of cosmic
connection Wasn’t Pasternak a
classmate of yours

IGNACIO
(respectfully)
That’s right Are you friends of
his
SALGADO
No no not at all

IGNACIO
(laughing)
Poor guy We really let him have

it

Another man SILVATICI sitting behind Ignacio joins the
conversation

SILVATICI
his is unbelievable I’ma
anager at the supermarket where
hat psycho worked for a while

Isabel is simply stunned Salgado however starts to look
around at the other passengers concerned¢

SILVATICI
He was always arguing with
the clients so I had to fire
him And then--

SALGADO
(interrupting)
Excuse me doesanyone else here
know Gabriel Pasternak

All the PASSENGERS on the plane turn around

MANy 1
(surprased)
Yes why

MAN 2
He was my neighbor

SALGADO
What are you doing on this
plane Did you buy your own
tickets

SILVATICI
No I work for a real estate
firm and the client sent me a
ticket to go see a property that
is going on the auction block

IGNACIO
I was called to a meeting at the
Ministry of Tourism They got
the ticket for me

ESTELA
I won the ticket at a raffle
(starting to realize
what’s happening)
I couldn’t change the ticket
Today was the only day I could
fly

Salgado notices that the FLIGHT ATTENDANT is trembling
with horror in her eyes

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Gabriel Pasternak is a steward
on this flight We were friends
then he asked me out and when I
said no he started to get--
Well that doesnt matter now
As soon as we took off he went
into the cockpit to take the
pilots some coffee and he hasnt
come back The door is locked
and the pilots arent
responding I dont know what to
do

The passengers begin to panic

Music begins playing over the loudspeakers and both Salgado
and Isabel recognize it it is the piece Pasternak
presented at the competition

ISABEL
(crying to Salgado)
I left him for his only friend

Isabel turns and looks arownd the plane In one of the last
rows she recognizes the ONLY FRIEND she left Gabriel for

He is about 35 andsoverweight—time has not been kind to
him He takes off his earphones and waves to Isabel
smiling He clearly has no idea whats going on

CARLOS “athusky man runs up to the cockpit door

CARLOS
(banging on the door)
Gabriel are you in there
Gabriel Its me Carlos Carlos
Olivé talk to me please

SILVATICI
(coming over)
Where do you know him from

CARLOS

I was his psychiatrist At some
point I raised my rates and he
got mad and never came back

(banging on the door

again)
Open up Gabriel Listen to me
none of this is your fault
Youre the victim here Let me
spell it out for you your
parents are the ones to blame
Since you were born they asked
too much of you putting all
their frustrations on you
They’re the ones responsible for
your suffering not us

Isabel looks out the window and sees that the plane is
coming down quickly towards a place she recognizes

ISABEL
(to Salgado terrified)
San Justo That’s Gabriels

hometown

CUT TO

EXT SUBURBAN HOUSE - PATIO DAY

PASTERNAK’S PARENTS a couple in their ‘sixties looking none
too good for their age are drinking mateon’a patio that
has also seen better days

The sound of the birds is suddenhy obliterated by the sound
of the airplane engines

When they look up to the sky they see the Boeing 747
coming down towards them

The image freezes and turnSpinto a sketch

As if this wereva storybook the page turns and we continue
with our next tales
THE RATS

EXT ROADSIDE RESTAURANT NIGHT
It is pouring rain

An expensive-looking 4x4 parks outside a roadside
restaurant in the middle of nowhere

INT ROADSIDE RESTAURANT NIGHT

The WAITRESS—age 25 medium height a little on the plump
side with a sweet face-sees MINICHELO (age -50)enter

WAITRESS
(standing up)
Hi Just one tonight

MINICHELO

(friendly)

Well you seem to bey good at
math

The waitress forces a smile

MINICHELO
Yes just one

When she looks Minichelo in the eyes the waitress
recognizes him from somewhere but she doesn’t let on

WAITRESS
(handing him the menu)
Whenever you’re ready Today’s
Special is pork ribs

Minichelo sits down He places an envelope with papers on
thetable and puts on his glasses to read through the menu

The waitress heads into the kitchen visibly upset

We hear the sound of a toilet flushing from the employee
bathroom

A few seconds later the COOK appears a thin 45-year-old
woman with circles under her eyes and teeth stained from a
lifetime of smoking She notices that someone has come in
to the restaurant

COOK
Did he order

The waitress doesn’t answer It’s as if she were in a
trance

COOK
(snapping her fingers)
Hey

WAITRESS

That guy is from my hometown A
loan shark a small-time crook
He put our house on the auction
block and my father committed
suicide over it Two weeks after
the funeral he made a move on
my mother He wouldnt take no
for an answer so we ended up
moving out here

(shedding a tear)
You know how many times I
dreamed of having him right in
front of me I’m going to give
him a piece of my mind

COOK
Your dad committed suicide
because of that man and all you
can think of is insulting him
Why don’t we put some rat poison
in his food

The waitress shakes her head thinking that she would love
to do something like that

But when she looks at the cook she realizes that she is
dead serious

COOK
There is some back in the
storage room A few spoonfuls in
the food and his heart’11l stop
ticking in five minutes

Fromthe dining room Minichelo gestures to the waitress

The waitress heads over with a placemat silverware and a
basket with bread

MINICHELO
Lots of work

WAITRESS
Not with this rain--

MINICHELO
That’s funny because I’ve been
trying to catch your eye for the
last five minutes You’ve got to
look out at your tables a little
more often baby

WAITRESS
Sorry

MINICHELO
(glancing at her legs)
You’re forgiven

WAITRESS
Are you ready to order

MINICHELO
(closing the menu)
For right now bring me some
French fries with a fried egg on
top

WAITRESS
Something to drink

MINICHELO
Diet Coke

The waitress nods and heads back into the kitchen

WAITRESS
(to the cook as she
takes the soda out of
the fridge)
I hate that bastard Make him
some French fries with a fried
egg on top

The cook doesn’t answen

The waitress glances atvyher and sees that she is holding an
old tin can with rat»poison

WAITRESS
Arey you nuts Do you want to go
to prison

COOK
Prison Do you think they’11l
send the FBI to do an autopsy on
this sleazebag He must be a big
eater with that belly and
ordering French fries with a
fried egg Theyll blame it on
cholesterol

WAITRESS
Just make him the French fries
OK

The waitress pulls the tin can out of the cook’s hands

puts it in a cupboard and carries the drink out into the
dining room

MINICHELO
(going through his
papers)
Let me ask you for your opinion
You seem like a smart girl
Which do you like better

Minichelo points to two poster mock-ups for his campaign
One has a red backdrop and the other a white

for mayor
one

The waitress smiles and heads back nto the kitchen

Both

of them read “MINICHELO IS PROTECTION”

WAITRESS
Both look good but I like the
red one better

MINICHELO
(nodding)
What about the picture Do I
look too serious

WAITRESS
No it’s fine

MINICHELO
Thanks for your help

The cook is chopping the potatoes and puffing on a

cigarette

COOK
Plus «jailjain’t so bad It gets
a bad rap but they feed you
they don’t charge you no rent
you’ve got nothing to worry
about And if you find
yourself a nice group of girls
youscan even enjoy yourself You
phay cards--

WAITRESS
(surprised)
Have you been to prison

COOK
(blowing the cigarette
smoke up the extractor)
Once And let me tell you I
felt a lot freer in there than I
do out here The outside sucks

WAITRESS
What did you do

COOK
Nothing I wouldn’t do again

The cook drops the potatoes into the hot oil putting an
end to the conversation

WAITRESS
And on top of that he’s running
for mayor That son of a bitch
Can you believe it

COOK
Sons of bitches rule the whole
world Wake up

From the dining room we can hear Minichelo’s voice as he
talks on his cell phone

MINICHELO
Let’s go with the red one but
tell them to Photoshop that
wart

The cook serves up the French fries onya plate drops the
egg in the frying pan and opens up the cupboard where the
WAITRESS has left the poison

COOK
What do you say Should we do
this community a favor

The waitress closes the cupboard again

The cook smiles tipping the frying pan with the egg over
the French fries so thevegg slides on top

The waitress takessthe dish to Minichelo who is thrilled

MINICHELO
Great-

Then she goes»back into the kitchen and starts washing the
dishes stibl a little on edge

Suddenly «she notices that there is something sticky at the
bottom of the frying pan that was used for the French
fries

When she meets the cook’s eyes she sees her smiling a
diabolical smile

WAITRESS
Did you add--

In the dining room Minichelo eats the French fries and
egg

COOK
Oh sure play Goodie Two Shoes
now but you knew exactly what
was going to happen

WAITRESS
What

COOK

(imitating her)
“What” The whole country wants
these assholes to get what they
deserve but no one is willing to
lift a finger Feel proud of
yourself sweetie for once in
your miserable life you’re
doing something to make a
difference

WAITRESS
I’m not doing anything

COOK
Oh sure you’re not doing
anything Instead of running out
there and pulling away the
plate you’re in here arguing
with me

In response the waitress heads for the dining room but
the cook grabs her by the wrist and holds her back

COOK
Calm down You’ve got nothing to
worry aboutwif they
investigate I’ lb say that I
used the poison in the kitchen
this mornimg because I saw a few
rats—which is the God’s honest
tuouth— and that a little bit of
powder must have fallen into the
frying pan What are they going
to say

The «waitress not knowing what to do glances out into the
diming room

Minichelo stabs the fries with his fork dips them in the
egg yolk and eats them up he shows no sign of distress for
the time being

WAITRESS
This is insane

COOK

(looking at the tin can)
Hey you don’t think this has
expired do you

(turning it over)
There’s no expiration date
How does that work anyway When
poison expires does it get more
dangerous or less dangerous

Suddenly a bus stops by the road

ALEXIS a 14-year-old BOY gets off the bus with a large
backpack and enters the restaurant

Minichelo embraces the young man—who is clearly his son—
and waves to get the waitress’s attention

The waitress anxious walks out into the dining room

WAITRESS
Yes

MINICHELO
What would you like to drink
Alexis

The boy who has a birthmark on his forehead seems like a
nice kid

ALEXIS
I don’t know Fanta

The waitress sees Alexis eat one of the French fries
She takes hold of the dish to takeyit back to the kitchen

WAITRESS
Let me warm thatup for you

MINICHPELO
(grabbingvonto the dish)
If I need at heated up I’11 let
you knows Now bring us the soda
please

Alexis takes another few French fries and eats them

The waitress “comes back into the kitchen She is desperate

WAITRESS
We have to do something—both of
them are eating now

COOK
Add some more poison

WAITRESS
He’s just a boy

COOK

(taking her wrist again)
But he’11 grow up and you know
the saying “like father like
son” Let’s wipe out the whole
family tree

(glancing at Minichelo

with anger)
That’s one strong son of a
bitch--

The waitress pulls away goes back out into the dining room
and tries to take the dish of French fries away again

WAITRESS
Excuse me but that must be
freezing cold by now

MINICHELO
(annoyed)
Who the hell taught you to wait
tables Can you go away and let
us finish

Minichelo pulls the dish of French fries away from her and
puts it back on the table so Alexis can keep eating

The waitress sees that Alexis who is about to eat another
French fry looks pale and weak Feigningsannoyance with
Minichelo’s reaction she takes the plate and dumps the
rest of the food onto his lap

MINICHELO
You fucking bitch nowyou’ve
really ticked me off

Minichelo grabs the waitress by the hair

WAITRESS
(shouting to the cook)
Call an ambwhance

MINICHELO
(forcing the waitress
downto her knees)
You’re going to pick those up
one by one»and beg me for
forgiveness

Seeing what ts happening in the dining room the cook seems
to be reminded of a traumatic event in her own life She
enters a dream-like state and takes a sharp knife runs out
and starts stabbing Minichelo in the back

COOK
Take that scumbag I’m going
to yank out your liver you
chicken shit

Terrified Alexis looks on as blood pours out in all
directions

The scene is so disgusting that Alexis begins to vomit
throwing up all of the poison he has swallowed

The waitress crushed beneath Minichelo’s lifeless body
calms down when she sees Alexis’s color return He is now
breathing normally

CUT TO

EXT ROADSIDE RESTAURANT —- PARKING LOT DAWN

Two police cars an ambulance and a truck from the local TV
station are all parked outside

PARAMEDICS are examining Alexis and the waitress

Alexis trembling and upset watches a POLICEMAN taking
pictures of Minichelo’s body

The waitress looks on while two POLICEMEN cuff the cook and
put her into a police car

Before the door shuts the cook looks over at the waitress
and cracks a weird smile

A TEXT OVERLAY READS “15 YEARS LATER”

INT WOMEN’S PRISON - CELL DAY

The scene opens on a picture taped to the wall It shows
the waitress with her husband and a kid at the Iguazu
Falls There is somethingsad in her eyes but at least she
went on with her life

In the jail cell four PRISONERS are playing cards

The cook-who looks older—plays a card and the prisoner
sitting to her leftytakes the pot

COOK
Fuck me
(to her girlfried)
Give mé a smoke

PRISON GUARD
(her voice rings out
from across the
pavilion)
Time to eat ladies

COOK
Let’s go before the food gets
cold We’ll replay that hand
later

The cook throws her cards on the table to end the game her
girlfriend starts laughing and the women they are playing
against curse but all in an atmosphere of warmth and
camaraderie

The camera exits the cell through a window and we move away
from the prison

The outer wall of the pavilion is covered with posters from
a political campaign Below an image of a young man with a
birthmark on his forehead the sign reads

“MINICHELO IS PROTECTION ALEXIS MINICHELO GOVERNOR”

ROAD TO HELL

INT AUDI DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD DAY

We are driving at high speed in the fast lane of an empty
country road as the third track from the Flashdance album
plays on the stereo

We see a sign that reads “BUENOS AIRES 270 MILES”

DIEGO—a tall blond man of about forty—is calmly driving his
Audi A5

An old Peugeot 504 sputtering smoke from itsgmuffler is
going about 50 mph in the fast lane

Diego flashes his lights but the driver of thePeugeot
doesn’t budge

DIEGO
(murmuring)
Come on asshole get moving»

Diego in a cocky move driwes up close to the other car
and flashes his lights again the driver of the Peugeot
stubbornly refuses to budge

Diego swears under his breath and tries to pass him on the
right but the Peugeot veers’ to the right and blocks him

When Diego veerS back to pass him on the left the Peugeot
veers to the left as well

Diego slows down putting about a hundred feet between
himself and the Peugeot and then steps on the gas
speeding upto 120 mph and passing the other driver on the
right

This timethe Peugeot doesn’t have enough time to get in
his way

When we pass alongside the Peugeot we see the driver
MARIO an overweight dark-skinned man with a sinister
smile
DIEGO
(yelling)
You dumb wetback

He leaves the Peugeot in the dust driving off at high
speed

CUT TO

INT AUDI DRIVING DOWN THE COUNTRY ROAD DAY

The Flashdance CD has reached track six and we pass another
sign the reads “BUENOS AIRES 205 MILES”

Suddenly Diego notices that the steering wheel is
twitching He lets go of it for a moment and the car
swerves to the right

DIEGO
I dont believe this

CUT TO

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

The Audi comes to a stop on the shoulder©f the road which
is elevated above the surrounding land«Theshoulder ends
with a drop-off that leads down to a small stream

Diego gets out and sees that he’s got a flat tire
Annoyed he opens the trunk

The jack is in the nylon poweh it came in It’s clear that
it has never been touchedbefore

Diego opens the pouch and studies the jack

He crouches down alongside the car and tries to put the
jack in the right’ position but finds that it doesn’t fit
He turns it over and it seems to be in place though he is
not entirely sure

Before continuing he takes out his insurance card and
dials the number of the road assistance on his Blackberry

After Diego has typed a series of numbers on the keyboard
an agent picks up

DIEGO
Hi I’m at mile 205 on Route 3
and-oh yeah my license plate is
U-I-A 719 Diego Iturralde So I
was saying Im at mile 205 on
Route 3 on the side towards
Buenos Aires and I’ve got a
flat How long will it take you
to get here It’s a new car and
I can’t figure out how to use
the jack OK so please send
someone out and if I can work
this out on my own I’11 call
back Thanks

Diego hangs up and checks out his surroundings

The road is deserted and it doesn’t seem likely that anyone
will show up to help He crouches down again puts the jack
in place and manages to crank up the car Suddenly things
aren’t looking quite so bad

He loosens the screw with the cross wrench removes the
flat tire takes the spare out of the trunk puts it on and
starts screwing in the first screw

Hard at work he notices that the Peugeot 504 is
approaching

Diego finishes with the first screw and hurries to screw on
the other three

Closer now the Peugeot’s flashers come on and the vehicle
slows down

Diego is on the third screw but since the Peugeot has
almost reached him now-and the flat tire jand all of his
tools are still on the ground-he leavéSpeverything and
jumps into the Audi

Mario comes to a stop right next to him and rolls down the
window

MARIO
What’s a matter Did scare
you

DIEGO
(cocky)
Just drive»on by man--

Mario sees the tools lying on the ground He smiles and
parks in front of the Audi

Then he“backs uppuntil his car is almost touching the Audi
Diego locks the doors

Mario gets out of the Peugeot rests his hands on the hood
of the Audi and looks Diego straight in the eye

DIEGO
Seriously man let it go I’m
not looking for trouble Sorry
if I offended you

Mario gives him a provocative look and spits on his window
DIEGO
(feigning a smile)

OK then You done

Mario smiles back and then takes hold of one of his
windshield wipers and rips it off the car

DIEGO
What are you doing Calm down
I didn’t do anything to you--

MARIO
Why don’t you yell at me the way
you yelled before What was it
that you said back there

Diego sees a truck driving by and honks his horn several
times But Mario waves to the TRUCK DRIVER and gestures for
him to continue on his way

The truck driver flashes his lights and continues down the
country road

Once the truck is out of sight Mario walks around the
Audi picks the cross wrench up off the ground and»pholds it
pensively

DIEGO
I already told you I wassorry
I don’t know what elsesyou want
me to do If I have to getout
of the car I’1ll get out but I
think we can justlet the whole
thing go

Mario bursts out laughing

Seconds later he brings the wrench crashing down against
the front window¢which cracks

Diego who is now truly frightened dials 911 on his
Blackberry but a recording picks up letting him know that
all of the operators are busy

He pretends to be talking to the police anyway

DIEGO
Listen I’m at mile 205 on Route
3 and this guy is attacking me--

Mario hits the window again

DIEGO
(to Mario)
It’s reinforced glass you’re
not going to break it

MARIO
Chicken

DIEGO
(on the phone)
The license plate number is--

Mario smiles Mario’s car is parked so close that Diego
can’t see the license plate

DIEGO
I can’t make it out can you
send a car as quickly as
possible please That’s fine
Please hurry he’s out of
control

Mario looks at his watch sarcastically

MARIO
I’m sure they’1ll be right over

Diego nods and pretends to hang up but leaves the phone
open in the hope that someone will actually answer

Mario still not satisfied thinks about what else he can
do to him

DIEGO
Look you’ve ruined my car
That’s enough Just get out of
here

Looking pleased with himself Mario climbs up on the hood
of the Audi and undoes his belt

Diego has no idea what Mario has in mind until he turns
around lowers his pants crouches down and defecates on
his front window

Diego can’t believe it

When he’s done Mario climbs off the car takes the tool
pouch and uses it to wipe his ass

Finally he glances at Diego through the window and smiles
sadistically

MARIO
See ya chicken shit

He turnsaround and gets into the Peugeot ready to drive
off

But Diego can’t take the humiliation anymore and in a fit
ofrage he turns on the Audi hits the gas and rams into
the Peugeot pushing it to the edge of the shoulder

Mario desperate steps on the brakes as hard as he can
pulls up the hand brake and tries to turn but the Audi is
so heavy that it pushes the Peugeot over the edge and down
into the gully Mario’s car goes head first into the
stream

Diego then backs up gets out of the Audi adjusts the last

screw on the spare and tosses the tools and the flat into
the back seat

Mario furious climbs out of the window of the Peugeot He
makes his way up the gully but when he gets back to the
road he sees Diego inside his Audi driving off

MARIO
(running after him)

I’ve got your license plate
number you son of a bitch
You’re dead Did you hear me U-
I-A I’m going to kill you No
one can protect you When I find
you I’1l crack your head open

Diego continues to drive hitting the windshield-wiper
button But then he thinks about Mario’s threats after
what he just did this psycho might actually come try to
kill him

So he makes a U-turn and drives the wrong way along the
shoulder to run Mario over

Mario can’t believe it He jumps off to the side and just
barely avoids getting hit by theAudi

Like a bull in a rodeo Diegogmakes another U-turn and
speeds up again to hit Mario with the car

But the Audi is heavy and when Diego drives over a less
firm section of the shoulder the ground caves out from
under the car which Ships down the gully and comes
crashing against the Peugeot

The Audi airbagyopens in the crash and Diego is trapped in
the car he can barely see

The chaotic scene contrasts with the music from Flashdance
which continuesplaying on the stereo

After a second)of quiet a noise is heard crack crack
crack

Diego looks in the rearview mirror and sees that Mario is
atop the trunk of the Audi wedging a metal bar under it

Diego’s phone which has fallen onto the floor of the car
begins to ring

Diego can see that it’s 911 calling but he is trapped by
the airbag and can’t reach the phone

Mario works the metal bar in and manages to open the trunk
He climbs in and starts kicking the backseat of the car to
get inside the vehicle

Diego reclines his seat and pushes back with his legs to
keep Mario from getting in but Mario is kicking hard and
Diego can’t stop him

Desperate Diego starts honking the horn and doesnt let
up A car or two drive down the road but since the ditch is
so far below the road and both cars are down there no one
can see them

Mario is almost in the car and a brawl now appears
inevitable

Diego grabs the fire extinguisher and readies himself to
hit Mario with it With his free hand he hits the lever to
lower the backseat

Mario comes crashing into the vehicle and Diego begins
striking him on the head with the fire extinguisher over
and over again

But Mario won’t give up Using the metal bar he bursts the
airbag and both men fall forward

Diego’s face hits the dashboard and Mario starts hitting
him on the back and neck with the metalpban

Diego manages to pull the pin from the fire extinguisher
and empties the gas into Mario’s face The shouts of both
men merge in a sort of macabre ritual

Diego takes advantage of Mario’s temporary blindness to
open the door He tries to climb out but Mario manages to
get the seatbelt around his neck and Diego hangs from the
belt

Diego tries to kick himself free but he can’t Little by
little he runsvout ©f air and begins to lose
consciousness

Mario takes ayfew deép breaths lowers the back window and
looks outside where all that can be heard is the sound of
the birds ‘singing

To do away with any incriminating evidence Mario rips a
sleeve off his shirt opens the gas tank and dips the
sleeve inside

He then takes his lighter gets ready to get out of the car
and before he jumps he lights the sleeve

But the smell of gas revives Diego When he sees the flames
and understands what is happening he locks Mario ina
tight embrace

Mario struggles to jump from the car into the stream with
or without Diego but he can’t get the seatbelt to move

Desperate Mario tries to blow out the flame which
advances fatefully towards the gas tank

listening to folk music on the radio

When he reaches mile 205 he doesn’t see any car on the
shoulder so he picks up the handheld

TOW TRUCK DRIVER
Attention station this is unit

Right then a tremendous explosion from the gully below
blows a cloud of smoke up onto the road

The tow truck driver slams on the brakes and gets out to

Mario and Diego’s skeletons are there locked in an
embrace

Since there is almost no skin or muscle left on the skulls
they even appear to be smiling

The detective takes another picture and the image freezes
This time when the page turns to lead us into the next
tale volume is added to the skeletons and they become

almost three-dimensional as if they were part of a pop-up

‘TIL DEATH DO US PART

INT HOTEL —- WEDDING RECEPTION DAY

We are in a reception room on the 20th floor of a fancy
hotel Music plays in the background guests are sitting at
tables and a screen shows photos of Romina and Ariel the
bride and groom who have yet to arrive at the party

The GUESTS smile and talk about the different phases of the
bride and groom’s relationship The photos show scenes
like

The couple as teenagers at the country club where they met

Their first vacation together at the beach in Punta del
Este Uruguay They are posing with the famousstatue of a
hand

With their arms around each other next to Bocha and Marga
(Romina’s parents) at a barbeque ata campsite

With their arms around each other next to Isidoro and Cuca
(Ariel’s parents) at Disneyland

Lastly we see an image of Romina and Ariel from just a few
moments ago showing their rings off to the camera

A smoke machine fils the party with smoke and we hear the
DISC JOCKEY announce

Everyone stand up and give a
round of applause for our
beloved Romina and Ariel

LUIS MIGUEL’S SONG “SUAVE” BLASTS

Holdinghands the radiant ROMINA and ARIEL descend on the
party triumphant

Romina is strikingly thinner than in the early photos
Ariel has a tan clearly from a tanning salon

The bride and groom’s PARENTS and RELATIVES all of whom
are dressed to the nines are the first to greet them with
an embrace

A KLEZMER BAND starts playing traditional Jewish songs

The FRIENDS OF THE BRIDE AND GROOM quickly whisk them to
the middle of the dance floor

CUT TO

INT WEDDING RECEPTION DAY

The bride and groom and the guests are still dancing
euphorically but now to another kind of music the end of
the song “Call me” by Blondie marks the close of the set
and the lights go on

The guests applaud and return to their tables

ARIEL’S AUNT AND UNCLE who have come from Israel to attend
the wedding walk up to Romina and hand her an envelope
with money in it

ROMINA
Thank you You shouldn’t have
Your being here is such a
wonderful gift Are you having a
good time

ARIEL’ S AUNT

(she speaks a little

Spanish but her

husband who just

smiles does not)
Lovely You very pretty and
family kind Too bad country so
unsafe Last night Roni’s
wallet stolen in restaurant He
didn’t realize

Her husband nods

ROMINA
That’s too bad It’s true the
situation is awful but little
by Little--

ARIEL’S AUNT
(pointing to the tables
of young people)
Nice people all friends

Romina looks around and to be polite keeps talking to
them

ROMINA
Yes That’s the table of
friends from the country club
We hadn’t seen each other since
we were like 13 but what with
Facebook and all we have gotten
back in touch Those are my
friends from college and their
boyfriendsthe ones that have
boyfriends that is And those
are Ariel’s coworkers--

Romina is referring to one of the tables farthest away
where Ariel is seen talking happily with his COWORKERS

Suddenly Romina sees Ariel patting LOURDES’s hand as if to
say “that’s just the way it is” Lourdes (age 27) has short
hair and considerable cleavage

Romina keeps talking to Ariel’s aunt and uncle who do not
seem to notice that she is clearly distracted by what she
has just seen at the table of Ariel’s coworkers

A WAITER walks by with a tray with champagne glasses

Romina picks one up and drinks from it

ARIEL’S AUNT
You know place to learn the
tango

ROMINA
I don’t but I’m sure my cousin
does I’1l introduce you

Romina walks away from Ariel’s aunt and uncle and goes to
the head table She opens her tiny purse andtakes out her
cell phone

She scrolls down her contact dist looking for a number that
she had once saved under the name “” (that is a
series of question marks) “ Tense and unsure of what she is
doing yet determined to test hér suspicion she calls the
number

Just seconds later Lourdés’s phone rings

Romina crumbles vinside

Lourdes glances at the screen on her cell phone but since
it is an unknown number she doesn’t answer

Upset Romana hangs up
Ariel is nowat another table
Romina reads Lourdes’s lips as she says to one of her

coworkers “Who is this jerk that keeps calling but never
leaves a message” She then puts her phone away

Romina gulps down the champagne and grabs another glass
She calls again
This time Lourdes picks up

LOURDES
Hello Hello

Romina doesn’t say anything but due to the background
noise Lourdes can tell that the call is from someone at the
party When she looks around she sees Romina at the far
side of the dance floor phone to her ear

Lourdes hangs up and focuses her attention on her coworkers
once again She laughs nervously as if everyone at the
table knew that something had happened

STAUSS’S THE BLUE DANUBE IS SUDDENLY HEARD

The wedding PHOTOGRAPHER and CAMERAMAN circle around Ariel
as he gallantly walks towards Romina to dance the classic
wedding waltz with her

The guests applaud as they look on

Romina hiding how upset she is dances in silence for a
few measures but finally gives in to her emotions and
asks

ROMINA
What’s the name of that girl
with the short hair

ARIEL
Which one

ROMINA
hat one from work

ARIEL
Oh Lourdes Why

ROMINA
No reason

Though they dance and smile for the camera Romina and
Ariel are both tense

ROMINA
And how does Lourdes know your
guitar »teacher

ARIEL
My guitar teacher

ROMINA
Yes your guitar teacher A few
months ago I asked you who was
calling that time that I
answered your phone and they
hung up You told me it was your
guitar teacher Since that
seemed strange I saved the
number And I called it just now
and that girl Lourdes picked up
Weird right

ARIEL
Honey I don’t know what you are
talking about I really don’t

ROMINA
Just seems strange With all the
cell phone companies and special
deals out there it seems pretty
weird that that girl would have
bought your guitar teacher’s
phone line especially if you
never introduced them What a
coincidence huh

Ariel doesn’t say a thing He thinks and thinks but he
can’t come up with a response

ROMINA
So

ARIEL
What

ROMINA

Say something If you don’t)
am going to ask her

Ariel’s coworkers look strikingly senious as if they were
hiding something they all knew about

ARIEL
Romi please--

ROMINA
Don’t you “Romi” me Answer my
question Does everyone at table
27 know that you screwed that
girl You invited all those
assholes to our wedding

At this moment Cuca Ariel’s mother appears She has no
idea that “there Ps an argument underway

CUCA
(overjoyed to Romina)
Can I dance with my prince for a
moment

ROMINA
(ironically)
But of course queen He’s all
yours--

Ariel dances with Cuca and Romina with her father Bocha
a tall broad man

Ariel who is upset looks on as Romina’s eyes fill with
tears She rests her head on Bocha’s hefty chest

Afraid that Romina will tell her father something Ariel
apologizes to Marga Romina’s mother and his next dance
partner and returns to Romina who is about to burst into
tears

The other guests think that she is overwhelmed with joy

Ariel furrows his brow and shakes his head but he doesn’t

ARIEL

(turning to the rhythm

of the waltz)
Honey let it go Let’s enjoy
our wedding Let’s not ruin it
for some stupid reason not
after all we put into organizing
it--

ROMINA
Did you or did you not sleep
with that girl Ariel

say anything

ROMINA
(sad as she looks him in
the eye)
Please tell me the truth I need

to know

Despite enormous reservationsy Ariel decides to tell the

truth

ARIEL
Yes I did

Romina looks extremely upset

Romina

about to pass out

ARIEL
But it didn’t mean anything I
swear

out of the reception

Confused the

on wondering if everything is all right

With a series of awkward gestures Ariel motions that
everything is fine and he walks out behind Romina

ARIEL
(whispering)
Romi let’s not make a scene in
front of everyone OK It was
nothing I swear that--

ROMINA
Don’t touch me

ARIEL
All right sorry I made a
mistake I admit it

stalks away from Ariel and walks

guests who were hoping to dance with her look
ROMINA
(seriously)
Get your hands off of me I want
to be alone

Romina shakes Ariel off and walks out of the party

CUT TO

INT HOTEL - 20™ FLOOR HALLWAY DUSK
We can see the city through the large bay windows

Romina rushes over to the elevators but since Ariel’s aunt
and uncle are getting their coats from the checker near the
elevator and the last thing she wants to dois talk to
them she goes the other way

On the other side of the hallway is the door that opens to
the backstairs

Romina walks up to the building’s rooftop terrace No one
sees her go

Ariel walks out into the had looks around and assuming
that Romina has gone downstairs pushes the button for the
elevator

CUT TO

EXT HOTEL — ROOFTOP TERRACE DUSK

Romina comes»through the door to the terrace and walks
towards the edge

She rests her hands on the railing and looks down at the
cars driving along the avenue far below

Ashamed and extremely humiliated Romina cries She moves
closer and closer to the edge Suddenly she hears a voice

VASALLO
Everything all right over there

Romina turns around and sees VASALLO (a tall and gawky man
of 45) He is an assistant in the kitchen who has come up
to have a smoke

VASALLO
Do you want me to call someone

Romina shakes her head

VASALLO
But are you all right I mean
obviously you aren’t but--

Romina starts sobbing even harder

VASALLO
(walks over and puts his
hand on her shoulder)
Calm down what happened

ROMINA
My boyfriend I mean my
husband I just found out that
he cheated on me with another
guest

VASALLO
Oh that’s awful

ROMINA
(in a sea of tears)
And now I don’t know what to do
there are so many guests down
there--

Romina cries inconsolably

VASALLO
Hey you’ll be OK These things
happen time heals all wounds

Romina shakes her head
Vasallo offers her a handkerchief

VASALLO
If you love him you will
eventually forgive him If he is
really theman for you you
will-

ROMINA
(blowing her nose)
I don’t know if I love him I
don’t know if he is the man for
me He’s an asshole

VASALLO

Well then to hell with him you
get on with your life End the
party and send the guests
packing I’m sure you’re not the
first person down there who has
been cheated on Besides you
can’t spend so much time
worrying about what other people
think

Romina nods

VASALLO
Feeling a little better
Romina nods again as she calms down

VASALLO
Listen if I were you I would
go down there and try to put on
a poker face for a few more
hours and then when you get
home tell him it’s over It’s a
shame I’m not going to deny it
but you have to get on with your
life

Romina nods again

Vasallo pats her on the back to cheer her up but soon the
friendly gesture of support turns into an embrace which
Romina finds comforting

When they move away from one another Romina looks at
Vasallo and finds him handsome like a sort of prince
charming whose figure stands out agadnst the sky as dusk
settles over the city and the first stars come out

Vasallo smiles and winks at hers

Because what Vasallo has just doneyfor her is so simple yet
so valuable Romina gives Mim a kiss on the lips

Vasallo for whom Romina is a stunningly beautiful woman
beyond reach doesn’t) move anpinch

Romina takes Vasallo ins he is shy and modest in his apron
the large city looming in the background She finds his
noble face movingsyShe kisses him a second time

Vasallo blushing yet full of passion kisses her

Startled Vasallo jumps backsand pulls up his pants

awkward gesture

ROMINA

mame to get around taxes will be
mine too

(showing him her ring)
So now we’re married legally

days sleeping with every
goddamned person who lays an eye
on me anyone who shows me the
slightest sign of affection And

face and say “Your honor I’m
doing everything I can to make
this work” That way our
marriage will last forever I’m
going to post all your secrets

torture you until you beg me to
stop you are going to be so
humiliated that your only way

bridge And then when death does
us part when YOUR death does us
part I’l1l have it all

Ariel turns around and vomits

Vasallo stares at Romina He is stunned He never imagined
how crazy she was

Romina strides past Ariel and his best friend and goes back
down to the reception

Vasallo who still has a visible hard on leaves as well
When he walks by Ariel he lifts his fists to protect
himself as if he thought Ariel might hit him but Ariel is
too much of a wreck to do anything like»that

because of the alcohol and loud music they totally ignore
him

Romina and Ariel up on their chairs are brought close

around the center of the dance floor

Lourdes starts to feel ill

the bouquet and tosses it in the air but it hits the disco
ball on the ceiling which sways from side to side and
falls to the floor

Romina’s friends look horrified they love her but at this

The doctor takes the band off Romina and looks at Ariel’s
relatives as if to say “There is nothing I can do”

ROMINA
(to the waiters)
Can you bring out the pastrami

The waiters who all know what happened between Romina and
Vasallo and are very amused by the situation start moving

WAITER

doesn’t seem to understand what is going on) seem to be on
Romina’s side

THE SONG “LUNA DE MIEL EN TU MANO” BY VIRUS STARTS TO PLAY

Many guests leave but many stay and dance

Vasallo glances out at Romina through the swinging door
thatleads into the kitchen

Romina gestures at him to come out and dance

Vasallo smiles shaking his head but his fellow waiters
push him out towards the dance floor

Other waiters bring out the hot pastrami

Ariel on the verge of a nervous breakdown runs towards
the bay windows and tries to throw himself out but he
slams up against the glass and falls back onto the floor
instead

The only ones who seem to notice are his best friend anda
distant relative who come over to help him

A few of the guests who are leaving come back to grab a
pastrami sandwich for the road

About one hour ago my client

finds Mauricio and the groundskeeper

Upset Mauricio gives him his hand

LAWYER
And that gentleman is Jose who
has worked for the Pereyras
for fifteen years

Mauricio nods

Sitting on the ground and leaning against the garage door
the groundskeeper gestures a greeting without looking up

From the television set in the kitchen we see what is
happening at the entrance to the police station

REPORTER (VO)
The latest information indicates
that the police have found the
driver’s whereabouts We are
going to ask the husband of the

victim for his reaction to this
development

The groundskeeper catches a glimpse of the screen through
the door which is opened a crack

The HUSBAND OF THE VICTIM-a bald man-is totally out of
control

HUSBAND OF THE VICTIM
What’s my reaction What do you
expect my reaction to be All I
can say is that whoever did this
is going to pay Can you hear
me No matter where you hide
I’m going to find you

The detective closes the door between thesgarage and the
kitchen and stares at the groundskeeper«

DETECTIVE
What happened Jose

LAWYER

Pardon me Jose I want to
remind you that you have the
right to remain Silent

(to the detective)
At the request of my client I
will be representing Mr Torres
He has no recordpand he is the
father of two children

DETECTIVE
(to the groundskeeper)
Canyyou tell me about the
aceident

The lawyergestures for the groundskeeper to respond

GROUNDSKEE PER
Well I always park Mr
Mauricio’s car and yesterday
I had had a little to drink and
I wanted to go for a drive I
have wanted to see how fast the
new car could go and I didn’t
think there would be a problem

DETECTIVE
Hmm

GROUNDSKEE PER
When I was going down Libertador
something crossed my path that I
couldn’t make out I felt a
thud but I thought it was a
dog

Mauricio and the lawyer look at one another the story is
different from what they had agreed on but it’s not bad

GROUNDSKEE PER
Since I was afraid that I had
dented the car I hurried back
to try to fix it before Mr
Mauricio woke up

Satisfied the lawyer gestures at him to stop there

The detective thinks for a few seconds He looks at
Mauricio who is shaking his head saddened he looks at
the lawyer who holds his gaze and then at the car

DETECTIVE
(to the groundskeeper)
Jose would you be kind enough
to sit in the driver’s seat

The groundskeeper looks over at the dawyer who gestures at
him to go ahead and do it and then sits down as
instructed

The detective takes note of where the groundskeeper’s head
hits the seat and he puts his own head at the same level

The lawyer aware that he has made a mistake grows
uncomfortable

Mauricio notices though Re doesn’t know what exactly has
gone wrong

DETECTIVE
Jose do vyou use the rearview
mirrors when you drive

GROUNDSKEE PER
What do you mean

DETECTIVE
In the positions they are in
now you would only be able to
see the roof of the car It’s a
miracle that you only ran over
one person

GROUNDSKEE PER
Well maybe they shifted during
the collision

DETECTIVE
All of them at the same time I
don’t think so I would say that
someone a good bit taller than
you was driving

The detective stands in front of Mauricio who is as tall
as Santiago

DETECTIVE
Does anyone else live here

MAURICO
My wife my son
(smiling nervously)
And my dog

DETECTIVE
(flatly)
Leave the dog out of this I
would like to meet your wife and
your son though

LAWYER
Yes of course Come into the
living room and I will ask them
to come down

The detective opens the door to the kitchen and ’walks back
into the living room

calm)

start negotiating

Through the window at the front of the house he sees a few
mone police cars arrive as well as some television crews

Through the large window that opens onto the backyard he
sees the lawyer and the detective talking near the pool

The detective has a serious look on his face He thinks
shakes his head says something and then shakes his head
again

Every so often he looks towards the upper levels of the
house where Helena and Santiago’s bedrooms are

After exchanging some final words with the detective the
lawyer asks him to wait He walks back inside the house to
talk to Mauricio Judging from his expression it doesn’t
look like good news

MAURICIO
Trouble

LAWYER
No Everything’s fine He is
willing to reach an agreement
but it’s going to be expensive

MAURICIO
(relieved yet worried)
Expensive How much

LAWYER
A million He has seen the
house your lifestyle he won’t
go for less The good thing is
he can take care of everything
He knows the police captain
most of the judges and he would
help us find an alibi

MAURICIO
For the groundskeeper Can’t we
leave him out of this

LAWYER
Well someone’s got to take the
heat Two people have been
killed Mauricio It’s been all
over the news

MAURICIO
(shakingwhis head)

detective who is waiting
in the yard)

The lawyer nods and heads over to the detective to talk

Mauricio outraged notices that the ygroundskeeper is
looking at him from the threshold to the kitchen it seems
that he has heard the conversations

MAURICIO
Everything OK Jose

GROUNDSKEE PER

Mauricio looks at)him inquisitively

GROUNDSKEE PER
For spending two years in jail

Santiago After a struggle Helena manages to force the
door to the study open

HELENA
Mauricio Santiago says that he
wants to confess that he is
going to go out there and say
what he did Please talk to him

expenses”

DETECTIVE
Well there are over twenty
policemen outside And there is
the captain If anyone has
seen or heard anything they
have to get a cut There are
also internal issues to attend

to We have to be careful of
any loose ends

The lawyer looks at Mauricio and nods indicating that this
is how these things are handled

DETECTIVE
So if you agree let’s--

MAURICIO
(clearly tense
interrupting)
Look I can get that money to
you but it’s coming out of the
amount we agreed on I’m not
putting out another cent

LAWYER
Mauricio come on

MAURICIO

DETECTIVE

(laughing)
Listen there is no time for
arguments like this If you want
to see this through we must act

dollars and you want thirty
thousand for contingencies

DETECTIVE

Mauricio gives his lawyer a penetrating looking

Oh it’s all so easy for you
right Telling someone else what
they did wrong Do you have
any idea how much a taxi ablthe
way out here would have cost
Im sick of getting ripped off
The curb had noypaint left on
it Do you have any idea how
angry this makes me

VICTORDA
And what about this Do you know
how annoying it is that you
always have an excuse for
everything and that you blame
society for your inability to
connect Today it’s the tow
truck yesterday it was the
traffic and tomorrow itll be
protestors blocking the road
but the truth is that you could
have left work early been here
to help get things organized and
to open the door and welcome
your son’s friends But no
everything is a priority for you
except your family The only
time we get from you is what
youve got left over from the
rest of your commitments And
I’ve been stupid enough to think
that some day you’d change But
you know what Society isn’t
going to change and you’re not
going to change either And
frankly I don’t want to wait
around for it anymore

Simon realizes that Victoria is serious

CUT TO

INT SERVICE DESKS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES DAY
Simon waits in a long line to contest his ticket

A CLASSY MAN in the line next to him tedls Simon his story
which makes him even angrier

CLASSY MAN

The worst part is thatethis is a
private firm Because if you
tell me that all the money they
take from us is being used for
drivers ed or to improve the
streets that would be something
at least But nok They keep it
for themselvés The city
government hires private firm
to rake it in-in exchange for a
nice “commission” for the
officials we vote for Thats
the way it is and youve got two
choices pay up and relax or
give yourself a heart attack
over it And you know what I’ve
got plenty of reasons to want to
live

The light-up number sign changes to Simon’s number

Reinforced glass separates the PUBLIC from the TRAFFIC
AGENTS in the booths

SIMON
(going over to the
booth)
How are you I got this ticket
and I already paid the tow fee
but there was a mistake The
curb wasnt painted

TRAFFIC AGENT
(pointing to the ticket)
Can I see that
Simon slips the ticket through a slot in the window

TRAFFIC AGENT
(taking just a moment to
read it)
You owe 360 pesos

Simon is silent for a moment He looks left and right and
sees dozens of people paying at the booths

SIMON
Listen I’m a little upset here
so please hear me out The
curb’s paint was all chipped
off This is the address where
the car was parked so you’1ll
have to send someone over to
verify what I’m saying then
send me an official apology from
the city government when you see
Im right Then I expect to get
back the money I paid for the
towing along with compensation
for the time I’m wastingon
this

TRAFFIC AGENT

The ticket says that your car
was parked in ayno-parking zone
and that is considered evidence
The fine is 360 pesos) and you
have no choice butto pay it If
you refuse interest starts to
accumulate and after six months
you lose points on your license

SIMON
Areyyou listening to me you
idiot Evidence my ass I’m
telling you that the curb was
notpainted yellow

TRAFFIC AGENT
First of all don’t insult me
because I’m just doing my job
And second you should find out
more about how the law works
The fact that you arent
familiar with the laws doesn’t
mean that you are exempt from
paying a fine when you break
them If you kill someone and
then you say “Oh I didn’t know
murder was a crime” you still
go to jail Maybe it’s true
maybe no one had explained it to
you before but you still go to
jail You get me

SIMON
Sort of What you’re saying is
that I need to memorize which
streets I can park on and which
ones I cant regardless of
whether there are no parking
indications

TRAFFIC AGENT
That’s right The information is
available on the Department of
Motor Vehicles website

SIMON
I’m sorry but can you call your
superior

TRAFFIC AGENT
There are no superiors to call

SIMON
Oh there aren’t Who areyou
the president of Argentina

TRAFFIC AGENT
Sir there are a lot of people
waiting If youdon’t want to
pay let me wait on sOmeone
else

Fisher

SIMON
Yes so Is that a crime

SIMON’s lawyer gestures for him to calm down

VICTORIA’S LAWYER
I didn’t say it was a crime

SIMON
Oh OK because that’s what it
sounded like you were implying

VICTORIA’S LAWYER
It’s not a crime but it is an
obstacle when it comes to paying
child support and alimony

SIMON
I have been supporting my wife
since the time I met her and my
son will never want for
anything Rest assured that if I
have a problem I willawork it
out

WorkingDoing what

(agitated)
Pardon me’ but I was the one
keeping things afloat for all
those years and just because she
haswhad a job for a month and I
haven’t you are threatening to
take my son away I hope that
the judge understands how unfair
that is

VICTORIA’S LAWYER
I can assure you that the judge
is not going to look favorably
on this sort of verbal violence

SIMON
(hitting the table)
Violence I’m just saying it is
like it is Where’s the
violence

VICTORIA’S LAWYER
The violence is everywhere Mr
Fisher on the street when I

turn on the TV or read a
newspaper like this one
(picking up a newspaper

with an article about
the fight at the
Department of Motor
Vehicles)

And I believe that the less

contact a child has with things

like this the better off he

will be psychologically

SIMON
(to Victoria)
You want to take my son away
from me Victoria

VICTORIA
I don’t want to take him away
it’s just that--
