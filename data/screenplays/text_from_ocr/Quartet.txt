sitting at this table for as

waving to others as he goes toward his table

was thank you He inherited a
fortune His grandfather made
laxatives -so I’m sure naming
this nursing home after him is
frighteningly apt

DR COGAN
(patiently)
It is not a nursing home It is
an exclusive private retirement
home

DR COGAN opens the second door to the MAIN HALL and
JEAN limps through it They pause at the flowers

DR COGAN (CONT’D)

have you You have a lovely room

The service lift is being
repaired -

JEAN
(looks at the chair lift
at the bottom of the
stairs)

never came my way Too many

REGGIE

secret You didn’t want me to know

been warned
DR COGAN
Jean Horton was such a big star She
didn’t want media attention Nor did

REGGIE
She didn’t want Always always

She did know that I live here

DR COGAN
Yes

REGGIE

She knew

(Beat)
Its been so calm here So
agreeable

(DR COGAN listens

sympathetically as

REGGIE rails on)
Do you know what I wanted I
wanted a dignified senility I
scrimped and saved - repaired my
own clothes had only one glass of
red wine a day One My only
indulgence was to buy from time to
time my favourite cologne And why
So that I could afford without
charity a decent room of my own in
this house And now she’s here

(moving toward the door)
I shall have to find somewhere
else to live

DR COGAN
Reginald I’m sure she -

REGGIE
You don’t know her

REGGIE opens the door to leave

DR COGAN
Aren’t you giving a talk to the
school children tomorrow

REGGIE
(resigned as he’s
leaving)
Dear God -

Tough as a monkey’s tit is Reggie

DR COGAN
(turns toward the terrace)
Who’s smoking

WILF
I suspect it’s George and Harry

The French doors are open through which the backs of GEORGE
and HARRY can be seen

DR COGAN
I don’t know how many times I’ve
told them smoking kills

WILF
For god’s sake doc leave ‘em be

REGGIE
That’s opera Originally people just
like yourselves went to see Opera But
then the rich came along and made it
something that it’s not So what is it
then Someone said ‘Opera is when a
guy is stabbed in the back and while
he’s bleeding he sings
(some school children
laugh )
Rap is when a guy gets stabbed
in the back and while he’s
bleeding he talks -
rhythmically and emotionally
but because rap is spoken the
emotion is held in check It’s
on one note
(MORE)

REGGIE (CONTD)

‘Why should we listen to some
old fart giving us shit about

sing our feelings to the rise

CARRY INSIDE Andit’s

sing it and hold it for as long as
you can and as loudly as you can
Octavia will do the same Ready

peter out at around ten seconds OCTAVIA keeps going on and on
When she finally stops -

OCTAVIA
(smiles)
I’m seventy-nine What’s your excuse
When I was your age I had the highest
recorded C note

THE SCHOOL CHILDREN laugh and applaud

REGGIE

What you’ve witnessed is the strength
and athleticism of an Opera singer
The people who live here have the
superhuman effort it takes to deliver
the goods to breathe yes to hold a
note -

(gestures to OCTAVIA)
- like the one Octavia just sang -

(distracted by the door

opening a crack

WILF
You say some very harsh things

tipsy)
You’re right Reg I hate

WILF steps off the Summer House and stumbles to a nearby
tree He unzips and begins to pee when he catches a
glimpse of CISSY and JEAN walking nearby and sees that
they have spotted him

WILF (CONTD)
(shouts as he is
peeing)
You may want to avert your gaze

He looks up to see REGGIE still in the Summer House
standing at the edge wanting to flee

WILF (CONT’D)
Easy Reg easy-

By this time CISSY and JEAN are near enough for JEAN to
see REGGIE as he indelicately climbs down from the
Summer House takes a few steps his back to them
CISSY
(as they approach)
Look Heres Jean in all her
glory

JEAN
Yes yes I know How are the
mighty fallen

WILF
(glances at REGGIE as he
goes to kiss JEAN on
both cheeks)
Tactless as ever You havent
changed a jot

CISSY
(admiring JEAN)
Didnt I say so Didnt I say
she still looks like a young
girl

JEAN takes a step towards REGGIE

JEAN
Reggie don’t I get a kiss
(he keeps his back to
her)
Reg
(takes a step closer)
I apologise for hurting you
Please be kind to me We were
different people then There
Ive rehearsed saying that for
the past week

Brief silence He registers what she’s saying

away

He starts

WILF
Hes upset because he wasnt
warned that you were coming

REGGIE
I’m not upset -

JEAN
Reg It’s the first time we’ve
seen each other in God knows how
Many years

REGGIE

CISSY
Has it been as long as that How
time flies
(thinks a second)
Oh you’re joking

WILF
Whats wrong with Bobby

He nods towards the garden

EXT GARDEN - POV FROM TERRACE - LATE AFTERNOON

BOBBY a little distance off stands gesticulating He
taps his watch makes imploring gestures taps his watch
again beckons

Now exasperated he takes a few steps as if walking
away then returns a little closer now and starts
gesticulating all over again

WILF’S VOICE
I think he’s trying to tell us
something
(calling)
Bobby give us a clue for
Gods sake Film book or play

BOBBY
Cissy

All their eyes on BOBBY

WILF
Its for you Cissy

BOBBY
(a shouted whisper)
The note

CISSY
(calling)
I couldnt read your
handwriting

BOBBY
Meeting Now

CISSY
(remembering)
Oh yes the emergency -

She hurries off towards BOBBY

WILF
I wonder what that’s all about

JEAN looks round and doesn’t see REGGIE

JEAN
Where’s Reg

WILF
(looks down the path)
There he is

JEAN
(starts down the
path calls out)
Reg Why does he treat me like
this Its not fair As if I
havent suffered enough

WILF
(calling out to her)
NSP Jean NSP

JEAN
(turns her head)
And what for God’s sake does
that mean

WILF
It’s one of our rules In fact
it’s our motto NSP No Self
Pity

She turns and walks towards REGGIE

REGGIE walking

EXT PATH WITH A VIEW - LATE AFTERNOON

Walking towards the Church carrying their instruments a
procession of the string quartet BILL lst violin REGINA
2nd violin FRED viola and LEO cello We can’t make out
the words but there seems to be a disagreement between
them SIMON and ANGELIQUE carry music stands

JEAN making her way down the path looking this way and
that The sound of the first movement Allegro con spirito
of Haydn’s Sunrise Quartet begins as she passes

EXT WOODLAND NEAR CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
The music faintly behind her JEAN pauses peers about At

the end of the path is a church JEAN takes a few steps
towards it looks more closely and sees the door is ajar

INT CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

She looks inside goes in looking about At the other end
she sees REGGIE silhouetted behind a lattice screen

JEAN
Reggie May I join you

REGGIE
(vehement )
No you may not

JEAN
Ive walked miles to find you
Reggie

REGGIE

Just leave me in peace Jean -

JEAN
I just want to -

She starts to advance
REGGIE

For Christs sake just leave me
in peace Leave Leave

JEAN
(shocked)
Reggie
REGGIE

I said leave

Emotional about to leave doesn’t She sits at the edge of
a pew From afar the strains of the Haydn quartet

REGGIE finally walks over to her stands a short distance
away After a long pause he relents and hands her a
spotless white handkerchief She dabs at her eyes and nose

JEAN
(smelling the
handkerchief )
Pino Silvestre I didnt know
you could still buy it
(dabs her nose then
aware of him gazing at
her)
What

REGGIE
I cant ever remember you crying

JEAN
I didn’t know you’d become
religious

REGGIE
I haven’t I was simply trying to
avoid you

JEAN
(handkerchief to her nose)
My mother taught me never to let
others see I was hurt

REGGIE
Your mother knew all about hiding her
feelings It was easy for her She
didnt have any

JEAN
Dont be unkind about her

REGGIE
I liked your father When he heard
that youd left me he telephoned and
said ‘Sorry old chap but count your
blessings Im still married to her
mother

REGGIE moves towards the door Brief pause

JEAN
I apologise for hurting you
Please be kind to me We were
different people then There
Ive been rehearsing saying that
for the past week

REGGIE
(close to the door)
Youve said it before Youre
repeating yourself

JEAN
(thinks)
Oh God
(brief silence)
Why do we have to grow old

REGGIE
Because that’s what people do

A brief silence

JEAN
What I did was unforgiveable -
but I was young and foolish
(he nods moves closer
to the door)
Reggie we have to come to some

arrangement
(MORE)

JEAN (CONTD)
We cant keep avoiding each other
or worse bickering like
children every time we meet -

REGGIE
(at door interrupting)
Jean I dont want to talk about
it I don’t want to re-live
ancient history Youre here Im
here Trapped Thats all there
is to it

Silence but for the distant music

JEAN
What are we going to do

He broods for a moment Then
REGGIE

There’s always the cliché button
The one that says ‘Grin and bear

it
JEAN
How about trying the one that
says ‘forgive and forget -
(REGGIE shakes his head
she again smells the
handkerchief )
The same cologne The smell takes
me back

(looks away)
It takes me back to you Reg -

Though trying not to REGGIE looks at her

forgetting has paid dividends I

EXT MUSIC ROTUNDA - EARLY AFTERNOON

On the backs of REGGIE and JEAN sitting on a bench They
appear to be watching the string quartet rehearsing the
Menuetto in patterns of sun and shadow A summer idyll

Angle from the front JEAN is actually contemplating the
answer to a question REGGIE has asked

JEAN
- No I was only married twice after
you and I annulled First was Charles
Tripper Charles and I lasted four
years although we were rarely

together
(MORE )

JEAN (CONTD)

He was a business man who mixed
business with pleasure one too many
times And then five years after that
I married Edward Fitzroy He wanted me
to retire and have children - so that
was that

(beat)
You never married again

REGGIE
No I didn’t want to anymore

JEAN
When I signed on to do Romeo and
Juliet in 1972 I heard you backed
out Was that because of me

REGGIE
Yes

JEAN
And when I played Aida did you
renege on the role of Radames once
I joined

REGGIE
Yes

JEAN
And then were you to play the
Prince in Rusalka until you
heard

REGGIE
Yes

JEAN
Why did you come here

REGGIE
My darling George died

JEAN
George

REGGIE
My dog - all of a sudden I felt
lonely

The STRING QUARTET stops playing and a spat develops between
them JEAN and REGGIE watch amused

JEAN
Would you say it’s time we resume our
walk

They both rise

EXT AVENUE OF TREES - DAY
REGGIE and JEAN walking

JEAN

-but I had no choice but to
come here I have very little -
the truth is -

(hesitates )
I have - financial problems All
I have now are my clothes and
jewelry

(nothing from REGGIE)
- and I didn’t confide in anyone
because I just didn’t want any
fuss Quite frankly I was
embarrassed You know what the
media are like They were always
beastly to me and if they learned
Id ended up here theyd gloat

REGGIE
(a little acid)
Really I’m surprised the media
still has any interest in you

JEAN
Oh do piss off Reggie there’s
a dear As a matter of fact and
this will obviously surprise you
more I continue to cut a figure
The other night I was Sir
Georges guest at Covent Garden
When I entered the box I received
an ovation

REGGIE
(zings her)
And now you’re here - scary

JEAN gives REGGIE an elbow

REGGIE (CONTD)
Ow

JEAN
(they walk zings back)
What do you do when you’re not
giving your little “talks”

REGGIE
If I need to tire myself I think
about art And if I need to
exhaust myself I think about
life But art -

He suddenly breaks off catching sight of someone through
the trees He turns vicious hissing

REGGIE (CONTD)
Bitch
(JEAN is alarmed)
See her See her there she goes
Angelique see her See her
(not shouting but loud)
Bitch cow sodding frog

ANGELIQUE oblivious some distance off wanders on through
the trees in and out of dappled light towards the glade

REGGIE (CONTD)
She wont give me marmalade at
breakfast She gives me apricot
jam

JEAN
You hate apricot jam

REGGIE

But Wilf loves it she does it
deliberately

(a little louder)
Bitch Cow Skinny-arse French
twat

(without pause turns

back to JEAN as if

nothing has interrupted

him)
Art is my chief preoccupation
Jean its meaning its
significance its ability to
educate and enthrall to inspire
and civilise

REGGIE takes a book from his jacket pocket

JEAN
(ironic)
So you do a lot of reading

REGGIE
(smiles)
Yes I do a lot of reading You
might want to look at this

He turns to a page She takes the book and begins to read

JEAN
“Works of art are of an infinite
loneliness and nothing can reach them
so little as criticism Only love can
grasp them and keep hold of them and
be just to them”

She looks up at him Pauses and shares with him something
quite private -

JEAN (CONTD)
It was after I had passed my peak -
that the pressure became huge And I
was so aware of criticism and the
importance of getting a good
reviewthe next thing has to be as
good or better and of course it can’t
be so in the end you get very
nervous

They are closer than they have been since they met Very
close

Suddenly they hear a noise JEAN and REGGIE look
around Behind a hedge they see a startled ANGELIQUE and
SIMON quickly gathering up a blanket They both stand
SIMON holding the blanket under his arm After a moment

SIMON
We weren’t doing anything

JEAN

(smiles)
You weren’t asked

INT MUSIC ROOMSMALL MUSIC ROOM - EVENING

From the outside FELICITY accompanying NIGEL doing “Tit-
Willow” After a few phrases camera pans over to the SMALL
MUSIC ROOM Seated are CEDRIC CISSY and REGGIE Though we can’t
hear CEDRIC is talking to them while WILF closes the door

WILF
Where is this going Cedric

CEDRIC

Ill cut to the chase I have a
brilliant suggestion Since the
four of you are here together
again I put it to you that you
should perform - at - the - gala -

(dramatic pauses)
- the quartet from Rigoletto

CISSY
(gasps)
That’s amazing I’ve been listening
to us Rig -

CEDRIC
(cuts her off)
Think of the publicity The Times
The Telegraph Opera Today We have
four of the finest singers in
English operatic history We’d more
than sell out
Then

WILF
(quietly to REGGIE)
We all know the bloody thing we
wont have to rehearse that much

CISSY
But Jean won’t sing in the gala

CEDRIC
Oh but you must change her mind
She’s a huge draw It would be as
if Maria Callas were making a come-
back

REGGIE
I’m not sure I want to sing with
Jean again

CEDRIC
(looks at others)
Why not
CISSY

They were married but it didn’t -

REGGIE
No- Cissy leave it out No I
don’t want to

CEDRIC

(studies REGGIE)
Well it’s a shame I can’t count
the number of galas you have graced
over the years with your
incomparable voice and I mean that
sincerely I don’t think you
realize it Reggie but people still
talk about your ‘Celeste Aida’ four
years ago Your ‘Ave Maria’ two
years ago

(REGGIE beginning to

weaken)
I know you don’t think much of me
Reggie that’s fine but for what
it’s worth when I heard you sing
your ‘Nessun Dorma’ at the gala
last year all I thought was ‘Eat
your heart out Pavarotti’

(REGGIE weakening more)
With this one concert we could
raise enough money to get us
through and attract much needed new
benefactors You would help save
Beecham House Reginald

(meaningfully)

(MORE)

CEDRIC (CONTD)
Unfortunately art is a luxury to
be paid for by those to whom it
matters

Silence CEDRIC senses the hook is set

CEDRIC (CONTD)
Well I must leave At any rate I
appreciate your consideration

CEDRIC leaves

WILF
(trying to be off-hand)
It’s one gala Reg You could do
it You could persuade Jean I know
it

REGGIE
(looks at WILF says
wryly)
Well money has always driven art

He takes out his notebook and pen

WILF
One gala It’s our life

REGGIE
(as he’s writing)
Count Kaiserling commissioned the
Goldberg Variations Culture wasnt
spread by artists but by merchants -
(hands the note to CISSY)
It’s to save Beecham House

WILF
Well done Reg

CISSY
Thank you dear dear Reggie

suspicious

Im flattered but I have
professional ethics to uphold

WILF
Throw caution to the winds

WILF at the door takes the hint

WILF

of fact they wanted Reggie to sing
La donna 6 mobile for the Gala But

WILF puts a restraining hand on CISSYS arm

JEAN
What

REGGIE
(jumping in)
“La donna mobile qual plumo
al vento” Women are as fickle
as a feather in the wind

JEAN
(she eats and drinks
ignoring the
inference)
I fell in love with you when I
first heard you sing that

REGGIE
(he sips wine)
That’s why I never sang it
again I took twelve curtain
calls

JEAN
You took nine I took twelve

REGGIE
Who’s counting

JEAN eyes him eating and drinking WILF refills her
glass but JEAN remains stone cold sober The others do
not

CISSY
She said a great honour She

This is why you asked me to dinner

Pause

WILF
No we asked you because -

He breaks off

CISSY
- because we love you

They avert her gaze

JEAN
Let me ask you something When did you
last sing This morning in the bath
In the shower Has anyone heard you
recently Have you any idea of the
noise you now make Do you really want
to be a laughing stock Why didn’t
you have the guts to just tell me what
you wanted How shameful of you to try
to trick me You’re pathetic

ninety-eight singing the quarter from

honour It’s not an honour it’s
insanity What you did was
disgusting All of you

I’m going to say something very
rude to you - Fuck you fuck you

JEAN turns and walks out

As CISSY REGGIE and WILF try to adjust aware of people

She was Italian Remember The
tenor had to dial 999

REGGIE

her)
Youre still very lovely Jean

JEAN
I had no idea you were here I
would have visited you

not seeing you for days on end

FRANK

JEAN
Never guessed what

FRANK
You remember Enrico Cardinale

JEAN
The baritone Of course I

with him too

FRANK

was having you

JEAN
No Did you Frank

FRANK

(they laugh then look
lovingly at each
other )
And youve been up to your
usual tricks
(nods to CISSY in the
other room)

JEAN
I dont know what came over me
Im very ashamed but Im so
unhappy here and -

Her voice trails off

FRANK
Poor Cissy She does so want to
perform the quartet

JEAN
Not possible

FRANK
(studies her)
A word of advice Take part If
you cant sing at the gala do
conjuring tricks The only
alternative is to be the guest
of honour at the crematorium

His words touch and trouble her

BOBBY
It’s your decision Now let’s

Panic

REGGIE and WILF

WILF
We don’t have the time -

They look up to see NOBBY come into the room He hands the
note to REGGIE as he whispers something

INT JEAN’S ROOM —- MORNING - RAIN

JEAN is seated rather regally WILF REGGIE and CISSY are
standing just inside the door before her They exchange
silent looks

JEAN
Please sit

CISSY looks for a chair vainly and then sits on the edge
of the bed WILF seeing no chair up-ends a low wastepaper-
bin and sits on it as REGGIE goes around the bed and sits

in the chair by the dresser

They sit

JEAN (CONTD)
(gestures )
Wilf you can sit on the bed

WILF
I’m fine I eat all my meals
sitting on wastepaper-bins

JEAN
(ignores his comment)
First of all - again I want to
apologise to you Cissy What I
did was appalling And to you
Wilf

WILF
I don’t remember you throwing
anything at me

JEAN
Please don’t make fun of me And
to you Reggie

REGGIE
I think it is I who should
apologise to you Jean

Their eyes meet Finally she rises goes to a side table
on top of which there are some poorly wrapped gifts

JEAN
I have gifts for you

She picks them up hands one to CISSY one to WILF and walks
around the bed and gives the third to REGGIE She returns
to her regal chair and sits

JEAN (CONTD)
Well Open them

CISSY tears open her package WILF hold his badly wrapped
gift out by one or two fingers

CISSY
A CD of our Rigoletto How
lovely

WILF smiles ironically

JEAN
I know you already have copies
but Ive signed those So that
makes them rather valuable

WILF resists a comment

JEAN (CONTD)
I also wrapped them myself

WILF
I was thinking you did

JEAN ignores WILF looks at REGGIE who has just opened his
gift a jar of lime marmalade and looks up at JEAN He is
moved Their eyes meet

From somewhere the sound of a violin playing Massenet’s
Meditation from Thais to the accompaniment of a harp

There is an awkward silence

WILF (CONT’D)
(looks at others)
Is that it

JEAN
(confused)
Yes

WILF rises awkwardly from his perch and moves to the door

WILF
(at door)
Thanks for the signed CD Do you
mind if we put them on eBay

Another awkward pause WILF and REGGIE exchange shared looks
CISSY still seated on the bed looks in her purse

JEAN
(rises)
Thank you for coming

CISSY rises confused takes out earphones attempts to
untangle them

WILF
C’mon Cissy

CISSY goes toward WILF REGGIE stands by his chair

CISSY
(still untangling
earphones )
Have you changed your mind about

the gala
JEAN
(emphatic)
No
WILF

(a slow burn)
Of course you haven’t Why should
you It’s only to celebrate and
honour the birthday of one of the
greatest composers for the human
voice who has ever lived

JEAN
You must understand that I was
somebody once -

CISSY
(still untangling)
I thought I was somebody now -

JEAN
But to be honest I shone the
brightest in the firmament

WILF murmurs a Gaelic curse JEAN realizes she’s gone too
far

JEAN (CONTD)
I cannot insult the memory of who
I once was

WILF
(explodes )
“The memory” What do you mean “the
memory” Whose “memory” Your fans
They’re dead They’re all dead
Either that or they’re living here
and soon will be

REGGIE holds a hand out to stop WILF

WILF (CONT’D)
For Christ sake Jean all youve
ever done is to rely on external
affirmation And look what it cost
you Just fucking do it

JEAN
What you refuse to understand is
that I’m a different person today

WILF
No you’re not Nor are we We’ve
aged that’s all And it happened
so fast we didn’t have time to
change In spirit I’m the same
lovely lad I always was I just
happen to be trapped in a cage made
of rusty iron bars with thank the
lord an undiminished level of
testosterone

JEAN
I simply can’t
(all eyes on her barely
audible)
My gift deserted me

REGGIE
It deserted us too Jean It’s
called life

JEAN
(looks at REGGIE)
Yes Shit happens

CISSY
Oh my darling ageing is not for
sissies

JEAN
No

Her eyes fall on REGGIE’s

All smile

REGGIE
Let go Jean let go There’s no
harm Who knows - we might even
enjoy it We’re artists aren’t we
And we’re meant to celebrate life
What else were we doing for all
those years

JEAN
Oh Christ Reggie Are you telling
me to go out and smell the roses

CISSY
Oh - the roses are long gone But
the chrysanthemums are
extraordinary

It breaks the tension

CISSY (CONTD)
Please Jean If you say yes
Cedric will give us the star spot
instead of Anne Langley

JEAN
(suddenly alert)
Anne Langley Here at Beecham
house I thought they’d committed
her

CISSY
She wanted to sing Violetta She
was a very fine Violetta

JEAN
Oh please Cissy Violetta is
supposed to be dying of
tuberculosis Anne Langley looked
as if she was singing Falstaff
and she sounded like a cat hang
gliding

CISSY
Well she’s singing Tosca now
We would have the Finale Jean
JEAN
Tosca

CISSY
You were the most brilliant Tosca
ever Jean The last time I heard her

Tosca her vibrato sounded like it was

waving at us

JEAN
Not waving but drowning

REGGIE
Is that a yes

(amused and surprised)
Not you too Cissy What a busy
boy he must have been

CISSY
Yes and very potent

They smile at each other CISSY is doing up the hooks on the
back of JEANS dress After a moment -

CISSY (CONT’D)
How long were you married to
Reggie

JEAN
Not for very long

CISSY
How long

JEAN
Exactly nine hours

CISSY finishes JEAN’S hooks and starts to put on her own
dress

CISSY
Nine hours How long did you know
each other

JEAN
Before we were married we had
been how shall I put it
passionate if you know what I
mean
CISSY
(wistfully)
Oh I do I do

JEAN
After about a year he got down on
his knees and asked me to marry
him He was very old-fashioned you
know

CISSY
He still is

JEAN
Yes he is So I agreed and a
date was fixed But then we had to
change it because I got a job at La
Scala And there I met- I met -

She hesitates

Gilbert and Sullivan enter the Common Room exhilarated

CISSY
Go on go on I’m breathless who
was it

JEAN

No names no arias It was
nothing serious- just- just one
night - with an Italian tenor

CISSY
Just one night

JEAN
Two They never take no for an
answer Anyway Reggie and I were
eventually married at three o’clock
on a Sunday afternoon in May My
father gave us a suite at the Savoy
Hotel We were to spend the night
there and then go to Paris the next
morning for our honeymoon We had a
champagne supper Scrambled eggs
toast and lime marmalade And then
I blurted it out I told him Id
been unfaithful when I sang at La
Scala

CISSY
(shocked)
You didn’t

JEAN
I did

CISSY
Why Why did you tell him
JEAN
I don’t know I just did I felt
the need to be honest

CISSY
That’s always a mistake

JEAN
Reggie demanded to know why I
didn’t cancel the wedding He was
very angry

She breaks off

CISSY
And he walked out

JEAN
No he ran

CISSY
But he was heartbroken Jean by
your confession because youd been
unfaithful -

After a moment JEAN nods wearily resigned

JEAN
Yes yes I know that now I was
young and impetuous and driven
(beat - lost in thought)
I was afraid of us I had my
career

CISSY
That’s why you cheated

JEAN
No That’s why I told him
(beat)
And that was the mistake of my
life And now it’s too late

CISSY
You still have your future

there just isn’t It’s all been

INT COMMON ROOMSTAIRCASE HALL - DAY

WILF and JEAN walking toward the backstage area with
their canes

WILF
Jean our sticks I think we
should try to get through
without them

JEAN
I’m not sure I can My hip’s
very bad tonight

WILF
I’m not sure I can either But
I think we should try It
would be more dignified More
operatic

JEAN
I may have to lean on you

WILF
Lean on Reg it’d be safer
And he’d be very pleased He
adores you
(she looks doubtful)
Trust me

They enter backstage

JEAN
(whispering)
Does he

WILF
(whispering)
Of course he does I don’t
think Reg has ever stopped
loving you

JEAN
How do you know Has he said
so

JEAN catches REGGIE’S eye
The String Quartet is coming to the end of the movement

JEAN holds and then comes to him They look at each other
for a moment then he looks away
REGGIE
(meaningfully)
At least you won’t be singing at La
Scala again

JEAN
No Never again Never again
Reggie

REGGIE

Is that an apology

JEAN
It is
(she looks at him)
You look very handsome tonight
Reg

REGGIE
(turning back to her)
And you look very beautiful
Jean

JEAN
And now we are old

A long look at JEAN from REGGIE
REGGIE
(is it tongue in cheek)
Then let’s get married
The string quartet has just finished their last movement

and the audience is applauding After a moment REGGIE
marches on the stage to an even bigger applause

INT MAIN HALL —- DAY

A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT bursts onto REGGIE

The audience continues applauding cheering and
whistling Some of the residents now stand or sit at the
back and join in enthusiastically

REGGIE bows puts on his reading glasses and produces
pieces of paper

REGGIE
Ladies and gentlemen this afternoon
my three colleagues and I are hoping
to transport you to times past We
have come to the conclusion after
much argument and discussion that we
are unchanged At least in spirit And
that spirit is most intensely
expressed when we sing

REGGIE (CONTD)
And so on this 10th of October the
anniversary of Guiseppe Verdi I hope
you will be moved by the glorious
music Rigoletto is one of Verdis
masterpieces And the quartet is one
of the great milestones in the history
of opera So now it is time for me to
make the introductions I myself am
of course the Duke of Mantua and as
Rigoletto we are fortunate to have
the popular celebrated baritone Mr
Wilfred Bond

WILFRED walks on without cane to great applause and
bows When he straightens up

REGGIE (CONT’D)
And as Maddalena our own our
very own the delicious Miss
Cecily Robson

CISSY enters and curtsies to great applause and cheers

REGGIE (CONT’D)
And last but not least one of
the great stars in the operatic
firmament for whom I know you
have all been waiting please
welcome as Gilda the great
the incomparable Miss Jean
Horton

JEAN enters without cane walking with difficulty can
barely curtsey to the great applause and cheers

REGGIE (CONTD)
Ladies and gentlemen the
quartet from Act Three Scene
One of Rigoletto by the great
maestro Guiseppe Verdi

By now the instrumentalists have assembled themselves
next to the Piano They begin to play the Quartet from
Rigoletto

The singers will commence singing During it we will
see JEAN faltering She will lose her balance and start
to sink as REGGIE puts his arm around her waist to
steady her

JEAN will pick up again and the orchestra will continue

Various moments like this will occur until the quartet
finishes At the conclusion the audience will applaud
and the quartet take their curtain calls During the
applause JEAN will whisper to REGGIE -

JEAN
If you ever ask me to do this again
I’1l1 kill you

They smile at each other as the audience continues to applaud
