the Zirst cf many honors we will see
As your mayor I have heard your cries
for help

The reporters roll their eyes They have heard this ail
before CLAYTON FRITCHEY 20s a bespectacled reporter
watches impatiently

CLAYTON
You think he’d hear my cry if i begged
him to move it along

Laughter from a few fellow reporters

MAYOR
As you know Cleveland has had its
fair share of no-goodniks
bootleggers and bums Previous
administrations may have supported
such behavior by taking a blind eye
But as I said when I ran for this
office I will stand for none of it

INT CITY HALL - SAME

EDNA NESS (20’s) a stylish and striking woman peeks
through a doorway and watches the mayor

Behind her FOOTSTEPS CLICK on the marble floor of the
rotunda ELIOT NESS visible only in silhouette paces
across the room

EDNA
That man is very fond of the sound of
his own voice

o- NESS

They ail are
EXT CITY HALL - SAME

The mayor continues drone on Impatience is visible on
the reporters’ faces

MAYOR
So today I am proud to present the
latest edition to our beautiful city
The man who cleaned up Chicago stared
down “Scarface” Capone and will help
return the city of Cleveland to her
rightful place of glory Citizens of
Cleveland I give you our newest
Safety Director Mr Eliot Ness

ELIOT NESS enters on cue He is barely 30 but his boyish
good iooks suggest he is younger and his piercing eyes
give him the air of confidence

The scene erupts in noise end flashes of light

Ness squints against the bright flashes as he makes his
way to the podium Edna ever the good wife steps to the
side and allows her husband his moment

In spite of themselves some of the starstruck press
actually applaud The mayor grins and vigorously shakes
the lawman’s hand leaning into as many photos as
possibie

Ness anxious but cool takes to the podium

NESS
Thank you for the glowing
introduction Mr Mayor And thank you
to the press for showing such interest
in a humble civil servant like myself
If I had known Cleveland was such a
friendly city I might have left
Chicago to Capone

Boisterous laughter from the press Ness already has them
wrapped around his finger

CLAYTON
What are your immediate plans

Laughter

NESS
I might unpack

NESS (CONT’D
Seriously we are still assessing the
course of action that best

REPORTER
Any comment on the rumor that most of
the police force was against you
coming to Cleveland

NESS
Can’t say that I’ve seen any evidence
but that doesn’t mean it’s not so

REPORTER 2
Come on Ness Everyone knows youre
here to clean house

NESS
I am here to turn the police
department of this city into a
respectable law enforcement operation
Am I going to stand for any of the
corruption that permeates this city
No I took this job because the people
of this city are being victimized on a
daiiy basis Decent people trying to
lead decent lives They deserve
better

REPORTER 3
Mr Ness how do you feel about how
things went with the Capone
investigation

NESS

Fine He’s behind bars and his mob is
in shambles

REPORTER 5
But to have spent so much time chasing
him hunting him down wasn’t it hard
to have to settle for the treasury
department putting him away on tax
evasion

NESS

Settie First of all it wasn’t my
investigation It was the
government’s I was working for the
city and the peopie of Chicago

(beat)
As far as Capone is concerned all
that matters is that he is in jail

Nicely handled The mayor beams

NESS (contd)
Thank you for your time gentlemen

Ness waiks away from the podium and heads straight
towards Edna

MAYOR
Thats enough for today boys You’1ll
get your pound of flesh from Ness
later

REPORTER 1

Ness

NESS

have you arrested

REPORTER 1

POLICE CARS and the CORONER’S WAGON are parked at the top

Couples dressed to the nines file into a well-lit
popular dinner club in downtown Cleveland Pockets of
HOMELESS PEOPLE hold out their hands to the rich but are
summarily ignored

SWING MUSIC from inside can be heard on the street as the
DOORMAN opens the door for the swanky patrons

INT THE CLUB - SAME

A BIG BAND plays and the dance floor is packed with
swinging couples Waiters carrying trays deftly weave
through the dancers to the tables that encircle the dance
floor

ELIOT AND EDNA NESS eat their meal AT A FAR TABLE but
they are still the CENTER OF ATTENTION Ness eats and
smiles at his wife but Edna is self-conscious with
everyone Staring at them and whispering

not all that interesting

EDNA
I should have had my hair done today

NESS
It looks nice You look nice Eat

EDNA
I can barely get the unpacking done
with all the invitations and telegrams
that keep coming to the house

NESS
I wouldn’t fill our dance card just

whose wives sent us the invites Can’t
imagine any of them will want to spend
time with us after that

A WELL-DRESSED MAN approaches the table

silence

NESS

MAN

Ness iooks around for something to sign Edna hands him
a piece of paper Ness shrugs and signs the autograph

NESS
There you go

The thrilled man takes the autograph and clutches it like
it was a Da Vinci painting

EDNA
(teasing)
“Are you really him”

NESS
Ridiculous is what it is

EDNA
You love it

NESS
I love you

Edna beams but almost instantly turns serious

EDNA
Have you thought about what we

NESS
Of course I’ve thought about it
(looking Edna in the eye)
You don’t have to worry about us
anymore This is a new chapter for us
So I’m not exactly a nine-to-five guy
You know that

EDNA
I certainly do

NESS
Listen there’s no Capone here No

important than that

CUT TO
INT THE CORONER’S OFFICE - SAME

DOCTOR PEARCE (70’s) looks up from his microscope and
wipes his lip MYRLO and SIMON stand in the doorway

SIMON
Doc Hello We were talking to you

The morgue is a large room filled with MEDIEVAL LOOKING
METAL EQUIPMENT Beakers bunsen burners and test tubes
line every open space on the shelves and walls An entire
wall is lined with wooden body-sized freezer drawers

PEARCE
I was lost in thought You should try
it once and a while

MYRLO
You got anything for us

Pearce hobbles over to TWO COVERED BODIES laying on
autopsy tables

PEARCE
Pretty gruesome these two Pretty
gruesome

SIMON
Any IDs yet

PEARCE
No head equals no teeth equals no
dental records No hands equals no
fingers equals no fingerprints It’s
going to be tough unless someone’s
looking for these men

Pearce removes the sheet covering the SECOND BODY found

PEARCE (CONTD)
What we do know is that this one is
approximately 45 years old 5 foot 6
let’s say 165 pounds

SIMON
Doc why is he orange

PEARCE
That is interesting The discoloration
is some sort of chemical baseWe’ re
analyzing it as best we can First
glance telis me it’s a rudimentary
preservative

MYRLO
Meanin’ what That the killer kept the
body for awhile

PEARCE
As far as I can determine the victim
was dead for at least two weeks before
he was found

Pearce walks over to the first victim

PEARCE cont’d)
Were going to compare the body type
to any recent missing persons reports
in the area See if we can’t find a
match

(MORE)

PEARCE (contd)
But everything is still up in the air
Quite a few tests to run Quite a few

MYRLO
So you have nothing

PEARCE
I always have something

Pearce matter-of-factly manhandles the STUMP OF THE NECK

PEARCE (CONT’D)
They were both murdered by the same
man

MYRLO
How do you know that

PEARCE
Both were beheaded between the second
and third vertebrae Identical
location Identical cuts Incredible
precision and incredible strength

SIMON
What does strength have to do with it

PEARCE
Decapitating someone is difficult work
with a number of blows Whoever did
this did it in one

MYRLO
What about their you know their

PEARCE
Their genitals

MYRLO
Yeah

PEARCE
We found them stuffed in the chest
cavities
(beat)
And both bodies were totally drained
of blood

MYRLO
What che heil does that mean

PEARCE
(sarcastic)
It means there’s no blood in them

Pearce reaches into the pody with his gloved hand and
pokes around in the clean organs

PEARCE (cont’d)
They may have been beheaded while they
were alive Sled out through the neck
while the heart pumped its final
beats

MYRLO
Lovely

PEARCE
Which means that if this is one of
those gangland revenge things you’re
so fond of dropping in my lap it’s
the oddest one I have ever seen

MYRLO
So

PEARCE
(irritated)
So I need the heads

MYRLO
Maybe our guy tossed the leftovers
into the lake

SIMON
Or

MYRLO
Or what

SIMON

Or maybe he kept them

The thick wooden door splinters inward from the blow of
the axe A FOOT kicks in the split door and Ness and the
other cops rush in to find

Hundreds of barrels fill the warehouse Distillery
equipment steams as if it has just been turned off Tons
of evidence Tons of hootch But no people The warehouse
is recently abandoned

STRATI

DALITZ
(crossing to the table)
Put a sock in it counselor
Prohibition may be over but my stuff
This is a special vintage You boys

Dalitz leads the two men through the dining area back
through the kitchen into a stock room and opens a door
that is nearly invisible in the wall

INT THE CASINO - CONTINUOUS

The door in the stockroom opens into a smoky well
furnished casino set up in the back of the restaurant
building

The TWO MEN following DALITZ trot down the stairway and
head for a roulette wheel

PATRON 1
This is quite a joint you got here

DALITZ

DALITZ
(laughing)

Then keep playin’
Dalitz sits the TWO MEN in from of a blackjack dealer

DALITZ (contd)
Set ‘em up Charlie

Dalitz pats his friend on the back and continues mingling
with the gamblers

On the opposite side of the room a STEEL DOOR is guarded
by a monkey-suited BRUISER This humorless lug watches
for a flashing light above the door and peers through an
eye slot when it goes off He lets in another GROUP OF
PEOPLE and locks the door

After the bruiser locks the door the light almost
immediately flashes The bruiser opens the eye slot and
looks out His face drops and

BRUISER
Holy shit

» he dives away from the doorway just seconds before
it and much of the brick wall around it COLLAPSES INTO
THE CASINO

DALITZ
What the fuck

Bricks fall from the wall A dust cloud erupts The crowd
screams tripping over themselves running for cover

Through the dust cloud headlights are visible as is the
POINTED METAL “ICEBREAKER” GRATE on the front of the
Cleveland Police Truck that bashed in the wall

Immediately POLICE OFFICERS swarm into the casino as
scared FATRONS fall over each other trying to get out
through the hidden doorway DEALERS gather their chips
and cash Daiitz quakes with fury as the cops round up
suspects

DALITZ (contd)
(grabbing Officer Strati)
What the fuck do you think you’ re
doin’ I pay you bastards every
month

STRATI
Not me you piece of garbage

DALITZ
What is this

bo

Strati grabs Dalitz who struggles like an animal Strati
drops him to the ground slaps cuffs around Dalitz’s
wrists and roughly pulls his arms behind his back

DALITZ (contd)
You stupid kid I got friends who can
bust you back to beat cop

ELIOT NESS emerges through the settling dust

NESS
Maybe you did Dalitz but they no
longer work for the city of Cleveland

DALITZ
Ness you cocksucker I ain’t afraid
of some snot-nosed kid Enjoy this
while you can ‘cuz I ain’t gonna roll
over like Capone

NESS
Get this idiot out of here

The cop shoves the fuming gangster out of the casino and
Ness is suddenly bathed in the flashing light of a
camera Ness turns to see CLAYTON FRITCHEY (the
bespectacled reporter from the press conference) and a
PHOTOGRAPHER

As Ness turns POP The photographer takes his picture
Ness crosses forcefully to the reporter

-and hugs him like a friend

NESS (cont’d)
Clayton Great you got the call

FRITCHEY
“Eliot Ness’ first bust in his new
town” This is why I followed you from

station house

INT THE POLICE STATION

Row after row of cluttered desks against cluttered walls
uniformed cops Secretaries and detectives fill the

Myrlo and Simon get to their desks before they realize
how guiet the room is They both look around at the many
cops and detectives who are HOLDING THE SAME FORM LETTER

MYRLO
(to and nearby cop)
Hey Danny what’s the scoop

Danny holds his head up His eyes are teary He takes his
letter balls it in his fist and tosses it onto Myrlo’s

with them

On the other side cf the room one detective throws a

punch at another

DETECTIVE 1
Look what you got me into What am I
gonna do How am I gonna eat

Surrounding cops break up the brawl The tension in the

squad room is thick

MYRLO (contd)
Ness must be out of his mind

INT AN OFFICE DAY

A YOUNG SECRETARY (20s) sits at her desk and looks
harried as she answers a steadily ringing set of

telephones

A PAINTER is putting the finishing touches on “Eliot

behind her

SECRETARY

phones continue ringing and the secretary continues her
standard answer

CUT TO
INT THE TOWN TAVERN - NIGHT

Cigarette smoke hangs heavily in the air and the regulars
chat in the dark corners of the bar Smoke and grease
Stained wood panelling only adds to the oppressive feel
of the room

A BARTENDER washes giasses in grey water behind the bar
as an OBVIOUSLY DRUNK WOMAN(40‘S) weaves precariously on
her barstool She is squat double-chinned with a mop of
greasy greyblack hair and liver-spotted hands

WOMAN
‘Nother whiskey Frank

Flo stumbles off her stool and out of the bar
EXT THE TOWN TAVERN - SAME

Flo wraps her tattered coat around her and wobbles down
the dark and empty street

A CAR rounds the corner and Flo turns As the car slowly
passes Flo tries her best to be seductive and leers
grotesquely at the driver

FLO
Heya mister lookin’ for some female
companionship

The car continues on and Flo flips it the finger

FLO (cont’d)

The car STOPS and slowly BACKS UP towards her

Flo tucks her greasy hair behind her ears and tries to
smooth out her moth-eaten dress as the car pulls toa

stop Flo stumbles up to the driver’s window but the

DRIVER’S face is hidden in shadow

The only parts clearly seen of the driver are his hands
And they are wearing the EXACT LEATHER GLOVES FROM THE
OPENING CREDITS

FLO (cont’d)
Evenin’ You like whatcha see

The unseen driver chuckles throatily and Flo hops in his
car

EXT KINGSBURY RUN - NIGHT

A filthy flea-bitten DOG sniffs around a dark alley for
its next meal The dog is drawn to a BURLAP POTATO SACK
overflowing with crumpled newspapers

The dog sniffs at the sack and begins licking a WET SPOT
at the base It gnaws at the twine that holds the messy
package together

As it pulis hard the twine snaps and the sack falls
over The dog recoils es something heavy rolls out of the
sack

The HEAD OF FLO POLILLO rolls into the view of the
streetlight Flos milky dead eyes stare at the dog
reflecting rays of moonlight

The dog looks at the head and BARKS AND BARKS AND
BARKS

EXT KINGSBURY RUN RESERVOIR - DAY

As the morning sun shines clear and bright MYRLO and
SIMON are overseeing a DIVING CREW preparing to explore
the molasses colored water of the large reservoir

UNIFORMED OFFICERS keep back the GATHERING CROWD that
stares down at the filthy concrete reservoir

OFFICERS drag long wooden net-poles through the murky
water as a DIVER suits up (The diver’s equipment is
straight out of Jules Verne - heavy copper helmet
weighted suit air turbine attached to a thick canvas
hose Think the toy divers at the bottom of an aquarium)

DIVER
I’m ready when you are detectives

MYRLO
Knock yourself out big guy

The diver slowly lowers himself into the muck

SIMON
Do you think we’ll find anything

MYRLO

Those kids found John Does 1 and 2
right over there

(pointing left)
»-and Jane Doe’s head was found down
there

(pointing right)
I bet the check somethings floating
around down there

Simon stares into the dark waters

MYRLO (CONT’D)
Doris was curious what you thought
of

SIMON
Yeah about last night I really
appreciate what you and Doris are
trying to do but

MYRLO
Whoa I had nothin’ to do with it
SIMON
I know
MYRLO
But she did seem like a nice girl
SIMON
Probably is
MYRLO
So what’s the problem
SIMON
I don’t need fixing up It just it
isn’t me
MYRLO

Good luck figuring out a way to stop
her Woman does what ever she wants
Gets an idea in her head and KAPOW

Behind Myrlo and Simon the small crowd is rapidly
growing They both notice the on-lookers but say nothing
As they stare into the reservoir

TIME DISSOLVE TO

EXT KINGSBURY RUN RESERVOIR - DUSK

Myrlo and Simon their jackets and hats off lean against
a squad car and drink coffee while the dive team
continues their work

The CROWD is now mammoth HUNDREDS of on-lookers fill the
street surrounding the reservoir and dot the rooftops and
fire escapes trying to get a good look at the police
activity

There is an eerie silence from the gathered humanity In

fact the only noise comes from the pumping of the air
turbine

SIMON
Looks like we’re the best show in
town
MYRLO
Lots of nothing leading nowhere so
far
SIMON

I wish knew some soft shoe

Myrio laughs weakly as they continue to watch and wait
The diver’s air tube makes gentle waves as the diver
Slowly searches beneath the surface

INT THE RESERVOIR UNDERWATER - SAME

THE DIVER scans the dirty waters with his huge
flashlight but the filth is so thick he can only see
about nine inches in front of him

As the diver searches he is bumped by one of the NET
POLES gliding through the water The diver is JOLTED
then annoyed He turns away from the net to continue his
search

And he is bumped again
The diver now thoroughly agitated turns to yank the

net Eis eyes widen in horror as he sees what has bumped
him It isn’t a net

BR DECAYING BLOATED ARM and AN EQUALLY DECAYED HEAD float
not five inches from his helmet The diver backs away in

terror and is bumped again He turns and sees a LIMBLESS

TORSO behind him

The diver’s muffled scream echoes through his helmet
and

EXT KINGSBURY RUN RESERVOIR - THE SURFACE - SAME

Myrio and Simon see the violent jerking of the diver’s
air tube

MYRLO
(to officers)
Pull him up Pull him up

The attending officers drop their nets and pull the diver
out of the mire The diver cannot get his helmet off fast
enough and he VOMITS into the grass

SIMON
What What did you see pal

DIVER
(gasping)
Sweet Jesus

The crowd senses the excitement and perks up Simon grabs
the net-pole and aims for the spot where the diver
points

Simon feels the pole hit something He looks to Myrlo

MYRLO
Sam you got something

SIMON
I think so but what about
(nodding at the crowd)
»them

MYRLO
We don’t have a choice Pull it up

Simon pulls his pole out of the water THE DECAYED HUMAN
HEAD fills the net An audible gasp washes over the
crowd

There is a beat of horrified silence until a NEWSPAPER
PHOTOGRAPHER leaps a fence and

NESS (CONT’D
I am sure you’ve all read about some
of our midnight raids In the course
of six raids we have confiscated
thousands of dollars of illegal
distilling equipment and put the
screws to many casinos and brothels
all over the city

No reaction from the crowd

NESS (CONT’ D)
We are also very proud of the
beginning of a Cleveland chapter cf
Boy’s Club This will give our youth
an organized and healthy environment

in which to play keeping them off the

streets and out of trouble
The crowd grows restless Ness presses on

NESS (CONTD)

One area for improvement is in traffic roan
fatalities Last year over 400 people

died in the downtown area due to
traffic related accidents and

A FRUSTRATED MAN in the crowd stands up

MAN
What are you going to do about this
terso maniac

NESS
Come again

MAN
You’re rattling on about stop signs
and kiddie clubs while theres a
maniac on the loose

The crowd rumbles in agreement

NESS
Sir the police force is leading a
thorough investigation of these
murders

NESS (cont’d)
And I’m sure the men on the case are
very competent and resourceful
detectives

ANOTHER MAN stands up and joins in the protest

MAN Zz
How do you know You canned all the
cops

NESS

Any police officers I relieved of
their badges were not serving the best
interests of the city

MAN Z
And you didnt answer my goddamn
question What are you going to do
about the torso killer

Ness looks to the Mayor for assistance The mayor turns
away from him

NESS
We have many excellent detectives
working on the case I have no doubt
that we will apprehend this man soon
The citizens should remain calm

MAN
What are you talking about There is a
maniac stalking us

The protests and hysteria become a wall of noise Ness
tries to regain control to no avail

In another city Not too different
from Cleveland now that I think of
it The killer there preyed on the
poor Targeted prostitutes All of
them butchered This guy he gutted

Each victim there were five of them
I think Each of them was more
brutalized than the last Sometimes
their organs were missing

pay it too much mind I mean after
all it was only whores right

it Then the story consumed the city
the whole country People were afraid
to gO out at night Panic was so
thick you could almost and then it
got even worse The killer started
sending the cops notes And presents

Pieces of his victims Ears skin

Gerber points to a dateline charts of the murders that
hangs behind a ROW OF TAGGED SKULLS
GERBER (CONT’D)
Cases 3 6 and 7 show the rodies were
cleanly dismembered at the shoulder
and hip joints each by one precise
cut around said joints followed by a
strong twist wrenching the head out of
the cavity
NESS
We already know the “how” doctor —

What about the “why”

GERBER

Thats where it gets tricky
MYRLO

Tricky
GERBER

Difficult to evaluate

SIMON a bit flustered enters the morgue Gerber glares
at the interruption of his wisdom

SIMON
Sorry I’m late Those new traffic
lights are slowing everything down

GERBER
May I continue

NESS
Please

GERBER

I believe we can eliminate sexual
deviation as a motivation Most sex
crimes are committed on one gender or
the other not both

before Myrlo can pretest)
Yes in some of these earlier cases
chere was some genital mutilation But
is this mutilation any more perverse
that the mutilation done to the ankle
or neck Is it a perversion or just
another cut

Gerber pulls open one of the freezer doors He pulls back
a sheet revealing the REMAINS OF THE TATTOOED HUSTLER
Simon’s face drops upon seeing the remains

GERBER
Take the latest victim for example
This work is deliberate and detailed
disarticulation While gruesome it is
controlled Sexual attacks are usually
more frenzied

NESS
What does that leave us

GERBER
Based upon the social histories of the
two victims we could identify we can
agree that our killer seems to be
feeding upon the lowest strata cf
society

MYRLO
Strata

GERBER

Social class The poor
disenfranchised So the murderer must
be someone who can move freely in this
strata At the same time our killer
seems to have an education His
knowledge of anatomy alone is quite
impressive
Perhaps he was iiving in a higher
strata and because of unfortunate
events sank into a lower strata

(beat)
Or for whatever reason he now
chooses to live in this lower strata

MYRLO
Stop saying “strata”

Ness smirks in spite of himself Gerber on the other
hand does a slow burn No patience

NESS
What possible motivation could make
someone do this

GERBER
The type of person most likely to
commit murders like this fall into
three groups The truly insane

MYRLO
No shit

o GERBER
The paranoiac He will commit the
murders as a result of his delusions
of persecution There is the
schizophrene who kills entirely
without motive or passion Then there
is the constitutional psychopath an
individual who cannot comprehend
between right or wrong But see I
doubt this is the case with the “Torso
Killer”

Gerber returns to the tattooed hustler to use as a prop

GERBER (CONT‘D)
Considering the cold blooded method of
the killing the dissection of the
body and the simple disposition of the
remains I would say we are dealing
with good cld fashioned arrogance

Simons glassy eyes are still locked on the hustler’s
“a remains

NESS
This latest victim seems to be His
head end face are in good shape All
those tattoos make him distinctive
Someone somewhere has to remember this
man

SIMON
No I knew him

MYRLO
You knew him What You were pals

SIMON
(beat)
What do you think of Gerber’s theory
That the killer isn’t some sex maniac

MYRLO
I think there’s such a thing as too
much education A queer killer makes
More sense to me than a cranky doctor

SIMON
So a nancy-boy a homosexual well
that’s insane right

MYRLO
Well according to the planet yeah

SIMON
(long beat)
What if I told you that I was é
homosexual What then

Myrlo laughs hard

SIMON (CONT’D)

to me Ever met a queer cop You
havent ‘Cause there aren’t any
There aren’t any queer cops in the

right

Walt cannot meet Simon’s gaze He just looks at the

SIMON (cont’d)

I’m sorry Walt This isn’t fair to
you I should have said something
earlier I- I never meant to put you
