MONTAGE - POV SHOTS OF PARIS SET TO MUSIC

We hear voices over - GIL and INEZ a young couple of
Americans engaged to be married as we shall learn (Standard
locations are listed here but they will be determined later
when we location scout Music

EXT MONETS GARDENS - DAY

GIL (VO)
This is unbelievable - look at
this Theres no city like this in
the world There never was
INEZ (VO)
Its become so touristy
GIL (VO)
Well thats just the awful era we
live in but can you just imagine
what this was like before - but
even with all the fast food joints
and the traffic - god you just
cant imagine what it was like
years ago
INEZ (VO)
Well you like cities
GIL (VO)
I really do - I love cities - I
love big cities with all the crowds
and all the action
(Having seen a panoramic view of let us say the Champs Elysee
we embark on a montage of the city The comments offered
above and following are an approximation of what the actors
feel)
CUT TO

EXT TBD - DAY
CONTD

GIL (VO)
Look at these places - the streets -
the boulevards
INEZ (VO)
You act like youve never been here
before

GIL (V0O)
I dont get here often enough is
the problem Every once in a while
for a few days is nothing - my
biggest regret is that I didnt
settle here the first time I came
I should have gone with my
instincts

INEZ (VO)
I admit its pretty but so are so
many other places Ive visited

GIL
If Id have stayed the first time I
came by now Id be a Parisian

INEZ (VO)

Starving

EXT TBD - DAY

(Pause here for third dialogue exchange)

GIL (VO)
Im thinking of a painting by
Pisarro Ive seen of Paris in the
rain Can you picture how drop
dead gorgeous this city is in the
rain Imagine this town in the

twenties - Paris in the twenties -
in the rain - the artists and
writers - I was born too late Why

did God deliver me into the world
in the 1970s and in Pasadena yet

INEZ (VO)
Why does every city have to be in
the rain Whats wonderful about
getting wet

GIL (V0O)
Its romantic

INEZ (VO)

Its annoying

Cut TO
CONTD

GIL (VO)
Or Paris when its just getting
dark - the lights go on - or at
night - its great at night - or
no sunset on the Champs Elysees -
GIL (VO)
Could you ever think of us moving
here after were married

EXT TBD - DAY

CONTD

INEZ (VO)
Oh god no I could never live out
of the United States And if I
could it would be someplace totally
different

GIL (VO)
Like

INEZ (VO)
I dont know Hawaii

GIL (VO)
Hawaii is America

INEZ (VO)
Yes but its - Hawaiian

GIL (VO)
If I had stayed here and written
novels and not gotten into grinding
out movie scripts

INEZ (VO)
Right and becoming rich and
successful Tell me the sad story

GIL (VO)
But this is where all the artists
came to live to work - the
writers the painters

INEZ (VO)
That was ninety years ago

GIL (VO)
Boy Id drop the house in Beverly
Hills the pool everything - ina
heartbeat Look - this is where
Monet lived and painted - were
thirty minutes from town Imagine

Cut TO
the two of us settling here If my
book turns out we could do it - you
could just as easily make jewelry

EXT MONETS GARDENS - DAY

INEZ (VO)
Youre in love with a fantasy

INTEXT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Gil and Inez enter lobby of hotel they are all at In the
lobby they are awaited by her parents JOHN and HELEN BLAIR
JOHN
There are our sight-seers
INEZ
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro -

GIL
What a town
HELEN
To visit
GIL

I could easily see myself as a
Parisien - strolling the Left Bank -
a baguette under my arm - finishing
my novel - at a table at the Cafe
Flore A Moveable Feast -

Hemingway called it

CONTD
HELEN
In this traffic nothing moves
GIL
Well yes it was different then
JOHN

Can we continue this talk of
moveable feasts at Grand Vefour
because Im starved

GIL
Americans eat dinner so early
JOHN
And Im proud of it

INT GRAND VEFOUR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

CONTD

HELEN
(lifting wine glass)

A toast to Johns new business
venture here

JOHN
Well Ill be perfectly frank - Im
excited over this corporate merger
between our people and the French
company but otherwise Im not a big
Francophile

HELEN
John hates their politics

JOHN
Theyve certainly been no friend to
the united States

GIL

(amiably)

You cant say they werent right in
not backing Bushs moronic war in
Iraq

INEZ
Please lets not get into that
discussion yet again

GIL
Theres nothing wrong with your
father and I disagreeing Thats
what democracy is Your father
defends the right wing of the
Republican party and I happen to
think they represent sub-mental
Neanderthals But we respect each
others views - am I right
(this last directed at
John gets no enthusiasm
but a cold look from him)
HELEN
Can we discuss the wedding plans
Your fathers used his good offices
with the opera to get some of the
singers to attend and sing I
thought Puccini would be nice
INEZ

Cut TO
Isnt that great Gil
GIL
Just no Wagner When she walks
down the aisle not The Ride of the
Valkyries Hey look I just want
to say that I am politically
bipartisan in that in my view to
be a politician of any party one
must of necessity be a whore
INEZ
Gil
Just then another young couple pass the table and recognize
Inez PAUL and CAROL BATES
PAUL
nez
INEZ
Paul Carol-
(ad-lib introductions)
Paul and Carol Bates - Mom Dad
you know Gil - you didnt mention
youd be here
CAROL
t was sudden Paul got invited to
lecture at the Sorbonne

CONTD INEZ
Oh - how terrific Dads here on
business and we free-loaded along

PAUL
Its great We can spend some time
together
GIL
Dont we have a lot of commitments
INEZ
What
CAROL
What are you doing tomorrow Were
driving to Versailles
INEZ
Im dying to see Versailles
GIL

Dont we have something tomorrow
We were going to have lunch at the
Brasserie Lipp My old professor
once actually saw James Joyce
there He said Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters

(silent pause)

INEZ
Is that the end of the story
GIL
It is actually -
INEZ
Wed love to go with you guys
Versailles is beautiful - I have to

see it Gil - its perfect for you
with your obsession with les temps
perdus

GIL
Yes - but -

PAUL

Its such a lovely treat running
into you here A demain
CUT TO

INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

INEZ
(as they do their
nocturnal ablutions)
I hope youre not going to be as
anti-social tomorrow when we go to

Versailles
GIL
How was I anti-social
INEZ
It was so clear you didnt want to
go
GIL

Well theyre your friends and I
cant say Im as taken with him as
you are

INEZ
Hes brilliant I used to have
such a crush on him at college And
Carols very bright

GIL

I find him a pseudo-intellectual

INEZ
I hardly think the Sorbo nne would
have him lecturing if hes a pseudo-
intellectual You should give him
your novel to read Im sure hed
be able to critique your writing
and show you why youre having so
much trouble

GIL
Im having trouble because Ima
Hollywood hack who never gave
actual literature a real shot
INEZ
(said with her usual
seductiveness)
Gil promise me if this book
doesnt come off youll give up
beating your brains out and get
back to what you do best
(MORE)

CONTD

INEZ (contd)
The studios adore you - youre in
demand - I dont think you want to
trade everything just to struggle

EXT VERSAILLES - DAY

Next day The two couples are there and Paul waxes
pedantically as they tour the grounds or inside
PAUL
I believe Louis moved his court
here in about 1682 - originally
this was all swamp land - in fact
if Im not mistaken in old French
the word Versailles means something
like terrain where the weeds have
been pulled The main structure
is French classical style at its
height - the work I believe of
Louis Le Vau I think Mansart and
Charles LeBrun I believe

EXT VERSAILLESPICTURESQUE SPOTGARDEN - DAY

INEZ
I think I could get used to a
summer home like this

PAUL
Me too except remember in those
days they only had baths and Im
definitely a shower man

CAROL
Where are you two planning to live
after the wedding

INEZ

Cut TO

Cut TO

CONTD

Were looking in Malibu We love
where you live

GIL
I keep trying to talk her into a
little attic with a skylight in

Paris -

CAROL
La Boheme
PAUL
All thats missing is tuberculosis
INEZ

He doesnt even know if he can
write a novel So far your track
records - you know - whereas
everyone likes your movies -
GIL
Yes movie scripts are easier
INEZ
Tell them about the lead character
in the book youre working on
GIL
I dont like to discuss my work
INEZ
Not the plot just the lead
character He works in a nostalgia

shop
CAROL

Whats a nostalgia shop
PAUL

Not one of those stores that sells
Shirley Temple dolls and old
radios I never know who buys that
stuff - whod want it
INEZ
(pointedly)

People who live in the past Who
think their lives would have been
happier if they lived in an earlier
time
PAUL
And just what era would you have
preferred to live in Miniver
Cheevy

INEZ
(teasing Gil)
Paris in the twenties - in the rain
- when the rain wasnt acid rain

CONTD

PAUL
I see And no global warming no
TV or suicide bombing nuclear
weapons drug cartels

CAROL
The usual menu of cliched horror
stories

PAUL
Nostalgia is denial Denial of the
painful present

INEZ
Hes a romantic Gil would be just
fine living in a perpetual state of
denial

PAUL
The name for this fallacy is
called Golden Age thinking

INEZ
Touche

PAUL

The erroneous notion that a
different time period was better
than the one ones living in
Its a flaw in the romantic
imagination of those who find
coping with the present too
difficult

EXT CHOPARDPLACE VENDOME - DAY

CONTD

HELEN
Its definitely the nicest ring
weve seen

INEZ
I love a diamond wedding band The
way it sparkled theyll see it in
the last row when he puts it on my
finger

HELEN
This is going to be such an event
Inez I only wish -

INEZ
(cutting her off)

I dont want to keep going over it
Mom

CUT TO

HELEN

Look hes your choice What can I
say

INEZ
Gils smart and successful

HELEN

And yet he talks of glvlng it up
and moving here That frightens
me

INEZ
The world is full of people who
dream of writing the great American
novel Let me handle him

HELEN

Youre father thinks youre
comfortable with Gil because you
can control him

INEZ
He likes to please me - is that so
terrible Oh gosh - I have to go -
Paul arranged a private tour of the
Rodin Museum

OMITTED

EXT RODIN MUSEUM GARDEN - DAY

Paul

Carol Gil and Inez getting guided tour

French and mostly English - as she feels

CONTD

GUIDE
This is of course Rodins most
famous statue A cast of this work
was placed next to his tomb Rodin
wished for it to serve as his
headstone and epitaph

PAUL
That would be in Meudon He died
of the flu if Im not mistaken -
1917 I believe

GUIDE

Exactly correct You know your art
history monsieur The design -

PAUL

(cutting her off)

cut To

Guide speaks

CONTD

The Thinker is so powerful because
he thinks not just with his brain -
he thinks with every limb and
muscle - you feel the
concentration

INEZ

(to Gil)

Hes so knowledgeable isnt he

PAUL
So much of Rodins work was
influenced by his wife Camille
GUIDE
Yes she was an influence - though
Camille was not the wife but his
mistress

PAUL
Camille No
GUIDE
Yes Rose was the wife
PAUL
He never married Rose
GUIDE

Yes in the last year of their
lives
PAUL
I think youre mistaken
CAROL
Are you arguing with the guide
PAUL
am
I

GUIDE
Ah non non je suis certaine

GIL
Im afraid shes right I just
read the recent two volume
biography of Rodin - Rose was
definitely the wife Camille the

mistress
PAUL
You read that Where did you read
that
GIL
I did - no question Camille-

Rose

is

INEZ
Dont forget Dad invited you to
join us at a wine tasting tonight
CAROL

Rodin

Me Why would I read a biography
of Rodin

CONTD

INEZ
(tasting)
I cant tell the difference
Theyre both delicious
JOHN

Take it easy Inez Those little

sips add up

HELEN
You should talk John - especially
for someone who once advocated the
boycott of french wines

JOHN
Ill always take a California wine
but the Napa Valley is six thousand
miles away

They laugh and drink

INEZ
(to Gil)
Which do you prefer
GIL
To me theyre all great What the
hell do I know
INEZ

I dont think Ive ever seen your
cheeks so red
GIL

Cut TO

Her parents having fun Gil

Pheromones its your pheromones
Paul and Carol have ambled over having heard Gils last
amorous remark
PAUL
Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels
the desire but kills the
performance - according to the
Bard
CAROL
Have you tasted the 61 Its
divine - though Paul found it -
what
PAUL
Slightly more tannic than the 59
I prefer a smoky feeling to a
fruity feeling dont you agree
GIL
You will admit shes a sexy woman
PAUL
This I have known for many years
Youre a very lucky man
(toast)

May you make the transition from
movies to literature and may your

PAUL

Hemingway Hey is this some kind
ofa -

HEMINGWAY
You liked my book

GIL
Liked - I loved - everything you
wrote —

HEMINGWAY
Yes it was a good book because it
was an honest book and thats what
war does to men and theres nothing
fine and noble about dying in the
mud unless you die gracefully and
then its not only noble but brave
GIL
Ernest Hemingway - this is - I -
HEMINGWAY
(introduces his drinking

brave bulls

SCOTT
Shes exciting - and she has
talent

HEMINGWAY

This month its writing last month

writer - you need time to write -

wasting you - because shes really
a competitor - dont you agree

GIL
Me I just met -

HEMINGWAY
Speak up for Christs sake Im
asking you if you think my friend

GIL
Actually I dont know the
Fitzgeralds that well -

HEMINGWAY
Youre a writer - you make
observations - you were with them
all night

GIL
A man who works in a nostalgia
shop
HEMINGWAY
What the hells a nostalgia shop

GIL
Where they sell old things -

CONTD

memorabilia Does that sound
terrible to you

HEMINGWAY
No subject is terrible if the story
is true If the prose is clean and
honest and if it affirms courage
and grace under pressure

GIL
Would you do me the biggest favor
in the world - I cant even ask

HEMINGWAY
What

GIL
Would you read it

HEMINGWAY
Your novel

GIL

Its only about four hundred pages -
if you could just give me your
opinion

HEMINGWAY

My opinion is I hate it
GIL

You do
HEMINGWAY

If its bad Ill hate it because I
hate bad writing and if its good
Ill be envious and hate it all the
more You dont want the opinion
of another writer

GIL
But theres no one I really trust
to evaluate it -

HEMINGWAY
Writers are competitive

GIL
I could never compete with you -

HEMINGWAY
Youre too self-effacing - its not
manly If youre a writer declare
yourself the best writer - but
youre not the best as long as Im
around Unless you want to put the
gloves on and settle it

GIL
No - no - thats okay -

HEMINGWAY
I wont read your novel but Ill

tell you what Ill do
GIL
Yes
HEMINGWAY
Ill bring it over to Gertrude
Stein Shes the only one I trust
to read my work No one discovers
new talent like Gert - whether its
poetry painting music - Shell
tell you if you have a book or not
GIL
You could have Gertrude Stein read
my novel

HEMINGWAY
Give it to me
GIL
I have to get it Its at the
hotel
HEMINGWAY
She gets back from Spain tomorrow
GIL
(rises)

Im so thrilled - my heart is
beating Ill go home and get it -
Ill give it to you - I cant tell
you what this means to me

INEZ
Lucky you didnt go last night
Youd have hated the music and the
crowd - but I had fun

GIL

Uh-huh

INEZ
What are you thinking You seem in
a daze

GIL
If I told you I was with Ernest
Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald last
night what would you say

INEZ
Is that what you were dreaming
about Your literary idols

GIL
But if I wasnt dreaming -

INEZ
What does that mean

GIL
If I told you I spent time with
Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cole
Porter -

INEZ
Id be thinking brain tumor

GIL
Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is
exactly as weve come to know her
from articles and books - shes
mercurial and moody and she does
not get along with Hemingway - and
Scott knows Hemingways right about
it but you can see how conflicted
he is because he loves her -

INEZ
Right right - er wheres my cold
cream - we should knock off the
idle chatter because were going to
be late

GIL
Actually I wanted to stay and work
on my novel - it needs a little
polishing

INEZ

had lost his hand when a grenade
went off and he couldnt fight as
he could when I first met him and
he was young and brave and the hill
was soggy from days of rain and
sloped down toward a road and there
were many German soldiers on the
road and the idea was to aim at the
first group and if our aim was true
we could delay them

GIL
Werent you scared
HEMINGWAY
Of what
GIL
Getting killed
HEMINGWAY

Youll never write well if you fear
dying Do you

GIL
Its my biggest fear

HEMINGWAY
But its something all men before
you have done and all men will do

GIL

Yes but -

HEMINGWAY
Have you ever made love to a truly
great woman

GIL
My fiance is very sexy

HEMINGWAY
And when you make love to her you
feel true and beautiful passion and
you at least for that moment lose
your fear of death

GIL
I dont know about that -

HEMINGWAY

I believe that love thats true and
real creates a respite from death
All cowardice comes from not loving

or not loving well which is the

same thing and when the man who is
brave and true looks death squarely
in the face like some rhino hunters

I know or Belmonte who is truly

brave it is because they love with

A31

sufficient passion to push death
out of their minds till it returns
as it does to all men and then you
must make really good love again
Think about it

They ad-lib greetings Picasso speaks French and is with a
beautiful girl - Adriana

I was just telling Pablo that this
portrait doesnt capture Adriana
It has universality but no
objectivity

PABLO
Vous ne le comprenez pas
correctment Vous ne connaissez
pas Adriana mais cest tout ce qui
la represente

STEIN
No tu na pas raison Look how
hes done her - dripping with
sexual innuendo Carnal to the
point of smoldering and yes shes

beautiful but its a subtle beauty -
an implied sensuality
(to Gil)
What is your first impression of
Adriana
GIL
(very taken)
te Exceptionally lovely
STEIN
Belle mais plus subtil plus
implicite Pablo
HEMINGWAY
Youre right Gertrude - of course
you can see why hes lost his
objectivity
(flirting with her)
STEIN
Youve made a creation of Place
Pigalle a whore with volcanic
appetites
PABLO
Mais cest comme elle est si vous
la connaissez
STEIN
Yes - avec vous en prive - because
shes your lover - but we dont
now her that way - so you make a
petit bourgeoise judgment and turn
her into an object of pleasure

And what about this book of yours
Ive been hearing about

haunted Jewish-Italian painter -
and I knew Amedeo had another woman
but still I couldnt resist moving
into his apartment when he asked
and it was a beautiful six months

GIL

Not Modigliani Was it Modigliani
You lived with Modigliani

ADRIANA
You asked me so Im telling you my
sad story With Braque also there
was another woman - many - and now
with Pablo - I mean Pablo is
married but every day its on

any woman can stay with him - hes
so difficult

GIL
My god you are a whole different
level of art groupie

believability but John and I
laughed in spite of ourselves

marvelous portrait of his French
mistress Madeline Brissou in the

twenties

GIL
Er - I have to differ with you on
this one

PAUL

Really

INEZ
Gil pay attention and youll learn
something

GIL

If Im not mistaken this was a
failed attempt to capture a young
French girl named Adriana - from
Bordeaux - if my art history serves
me - came to Paris to study costume
design for the theatre Believe
she had a brief affair with
Modigliani - then Braque - thats
where Pablo met her - er Picasso
Youd never know it from this
portrait but shes quite subtly
beautiful

INEZ
What have you been smoking

GIL
And Id hardly call the picture
superb Its more of a petit
bourgeoise statement of how Pablo
er Picasso sees her saw her - hes
distracted by the fact she was a
volcano in the sack

I dont know I see what he earns
but sometimes I think hes got a
part missing And I didnt like
his remark about tea party
Republicans Theyre decent people
who want to take back the country -
theyre not crypto-fascist airhead
zombies Did you hear him say
that

Nevertheless I hardly think your
idea of having him followed is
practical

sets supersonic flight - and yet
its not typical science fiction -
its unique

all that technology - whats good
about your book are the characters -
the human questions - love -
mortality - nobody cares about the

question our place in the universe
Unfortunately your book lapses into

easy pessimism I was having this
conversation with Giacometti the

(continuing)
Paris in the summer - what it must
have been like to sit opposite
ones lover at Maxims in its
heyday
Pages are torn and text cuts off
GUIDE
(continuing)
I am in love with an American
writer I just met named Gil Pender
His eyes widen
GUIDE
(continuing)
That immediate magic one hears
about happened to me I know that
both Picasso and Hemingway are in
love with me but for whatever
inexplicable reasons the heart has
I am drawn to Gil Perhaps because

he seems naive and unassuming
GUIDE
(continuing)
As always in this sad life he is
about to marry a woman named Inez
I had a dream where he came to me
and brought me a little gift -
earrings they were - and we made
love perhaps it is just as well I
accept Hemingways offer to go to
Africa Life with Pablo is too
full of conflict and I am
suffocating under his genius Why
I need to go from one brilliant man
to another is my weakness Gil is
different perhaps not a genius but
not moody and selfish like Pablo or
Amedeo was I think a trip to
Africa with Hemingway would help
get these feelings for Gil off my
mind
GUIDE
(finished reading)
I dont understand What is this

GIL
Its a little complicated to
explain Thanks for translating -
GUIDE
The writer clearly has feelings for
this man Gil Thats your name
no
GIL
She finds him no genius - naive and
unassuming - thats not exactly
dazzling

GUIDE
To some women naivete is endearing
And shes romantic She dreams of

Belle Epoque Paris anda gift of
earrings and making love with this
man

I think we should stay here - its
the start of the Belle Epoque -
this is the greatest most
beautiful era Paris has ever known
GIL
But I love the Jazz Age

uncertainty But think of it Gil -

nouveau home - Ill work in the

you can write - its the age of

Debussy and Guimard Maybe you can
meet Balzac

But what happened to the twenties
and the Charleston and Cole Porter
ADRIANA
Thats the present its dull

GIL
Its not the present for me - I
from 2010

ADRIANA
What do you mean

GIL
I dropped in on you just the way we
dropped in on the 1890s

ADRIANA

m

You did

GIL
I wanted to escape my present just
like you wanted to escape yours
To a golden age

ADRIANA
Surely you dont think the twenties
are a golden age

GIL
To me they are

ADRIANA
But Im from the twenties and Im
tellin you the golden age is the
Belle Epoque

GIL
Yes but dont you see - to these
guys the golden age was the
Renaissance Theyd all trade the
Belle Epoque to paint alongside
Michelangelo or Titian And those
guys probably imagine life was
better when Kubla Khan was around
Im having an insight A minor one
but that accounts for the anxiety
of my dream

ADRIANA
What dream

GIL
Last night I dreamed I ran out of
zithromax - and then I went to the
dentist and there was no novacaine -
these people have no antibiotics -

CONTD

ADRIANA
What are you talking about

GIL
And even in the twenties - no
dishwashers - no 911 if your
appendix bursts - no movies on
demand

ADRIANA
But if we love each other what does
it matter when we live

GIL
Because if you stay here and this
becomes your present sooner or
later youll imagine another time
was really the golden time And so
will I - Im beginning to see why
it cant work Adriana The
present has a hold on you because
its your present and while theres
never any progress in the most
important things you get to
appreciate - what little progress
is made - the internet - Pepto-
Bismol The present is always
going to seem unsatisfying because
life itself is unsatisfying -
thats why Gauguin goes back and
forth between Paris and Tahiti
searching - its my job as a writer
to try and come up with reasons why
despite life being tragic and
unsatisfying its still worth it

ADRIANA
Thats the problem with writers -
youre all so full of words - but
Im more emotional Im going to
stay and live in Paris most
glorious time You made a choice
to leave Paris once and you
regretted it

GIL
Yes that one I regretted but it
was a real choice and I made the
wrong one This is a choice
between accepting reality or
surreal insanity
CONTD ADRIANA
So finally you do love Inez more
than me
GIL
No - I love you - but this way lie
madness - and if Im ever going to
write anything worthwhile Ive got
to get rid of my illusions and tha
Id be happier in the past is one
of them
