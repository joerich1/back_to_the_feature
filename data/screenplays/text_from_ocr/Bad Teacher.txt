slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers

PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONTD)

year but know that youll always be a

part of the JAMS family

Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile
The Teachers lightly applaud

pulls out a gift card BOSTON MARKET 37

ELIZABETH
Almost forty dollars Thank you
PRINCIPAL SNUR

theres so much Im going to miss

INT ELIZABETHS CLASSROOM - DAY

Elizabeth sits at her desk cleaning it out Shes tossing
the few personal effects she has into a bankers box

ELIZABETH (V0)

My students probably most of allIm not

saying they were little angels butthey

were all there to learn and thatsthe

greatest gift a student can give a teacher
Elizabeths class is horsing around enjoying the last
days of seventh grade

A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
his yearbook in hand He hands it to Elizabeth who
considers what to write for a beat then smiles as she
signs it

INT JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box
SIXTH SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her
running toward their summer vacation

ELIZABETH (V0)

And I wish that I had gotten to know all of

you better but between four classes and

planning a wedding I had my hands full

From the little I do know about you I know

that our students are in good hands

Elizabeth passes Amys classroom where she is carefully
removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
them into cardboard tubes
EXT JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
thicket on the outskirts of the school property

ELIZABETH (V0)

And I cant believe its all over This
year flew by And even though Ill never
teach again professionally Ive realized
that I dont need a blackboard and
classroom to set an example

Elizabeth comes up behind them

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Hand it over
The Burnouts eyes all go wide and they freeze One of
the burnouts hands her the joint

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Everything
The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
a couple of joints They hand it over to Elizabeth

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
This was a warning Next time I dont
call the principal I call the cops

EXT JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES She gets in
pulls out a joint and lights it She takes a huge TOKE
and then PEELS out of the lot She tosses her bankers
box out the window and extends her hand giving the
school THE FINGER

ELIZABETH (0S)
Woo-hoo
A couple students look at her strangely

ANGLE ON
The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook
He flips to the faculty section and by the picture of
Elizabeth is her message YOU ARE ILLITERATE
DIM-LOOKING KID
(struggling to read)
You are Illit Illit

Elizabeth takes a big sip

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Something drops in the bedroom Mark alarmed turns
towards the door Elizabeth brushes past him into --

INT TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING Mark follows her in

Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed in the closet
behind the door

MARK

Just then the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES
Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA 23 dressed only
in a thong scrunched in the fetal position She stands
revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS and steps out of the chest

ELIZABETH

(TO MARK)

money
Sheila squeezes his shoulder

ELIZABETH
Im sorry if I care that my future husband
can support me We didnt all grow up
with a silver spoon in our mouths You
cant even imagine what its like going to
bed hungry night after night

MARK
What are you talking about Both your

ELIZABETH
My parents worked their asses off to send
me to private school Do you know what
its like driving a Pontiac when everyone
else gets a Beemer the second they
menstruate That shit stays with you

MARK
Its over Elizabeth

ELIZABETH
For the record theres a shitload of
things that I hate about you but I still
wouldve gotten married
(beat sweet)

She grabs her bag and heads for the exit Mark follows

ELIZABETH
You sad little troll I hope you and
your hooker enjoy chlamydia together
MARK
Elizabeth The ring

ELIZABETH
(not turning around)

She starts to open the door He closes it
The ring

ELIZABETH
Like I even want your gay-ass ring
She tries pulling it off

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease
Elizabeth steps out into the night The door SLAMS
behind her

AMY

and me juggling all my extra-currics --
but I just want to say that Im super
excited to be across-the-hall-mates

ELIZABETH
Okay

AMY

doing the bare minimum thing -- you were
kind of a lone wolf -- but now youre
back and I just know that you are going

ELIZABETH

Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash
and exits It hits the rim and lands on the floor
Okey-dokey

INT ELIZABETHS CLASSROOM - DAY

You know when I first got into teaching
I thought I was doing it for all the
right reasons short hours summers off
no accountability

LYNN
I love my summers Fresh corn Mmm

ELIZABETH
From now on my full-time job will be
finding a guy who will take care of me --

LYNN
Oh god I pray for that --

ELIZABETH
And that makes a shit ton of money and
doesnt ask too many questions
(licking her fingers)
I spent most of my summer hanging out at
the bars near where the Bulls practice
Had some fun got some cool souvenirs that
I Ebayed but those guys arent looking to
settle down And they all wear condoms
And then they take the condoms with them
Thats how paranoid they are that a girl
will try and get pregnant Like its so
easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
into a condom

LYNN
Youre gonna find someone great

ELIZABETH
Ive been thinking about it a lot I mean

orientation for teachers in the auditorium

LYNN

Tupperware tray

SASHA

Lunch is in full swing Each clique has staked its own
territory Several TEACHERS Elizabeth and Amy among

You werent at the orientation the other
day but were doing something new this
year Its very exciting Were
splitting the cafeteria into quadrants
Elizabeth yawns

AMY (CONTD)
So anyways in order for the quadrant
system to work its vital that each
teacher maintain order within their
quadrant Because its really tough for
me as head lunch monitor -- or another
teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
discipline a kid in another quadrant I
know its a lot to take in Id be happy
to sit with-you after school and explain
all of the new guidelines

ELIZABETH
Tell you what Why dont you send me a
memo and if I have any questions Ill
come to you

AMY
Okay Elizabeth Sounds like a plan
Stan

AMY (CONTD)
(TO ELIZABETH)

ELIZABETH

tell you how to run your class but maybe
it might be fun to do some ice-breakers
Like Telephone Charades or The String
Game Or start doing practice questions
for the state test Its never too soon
to start

ELIZABETH
Are we gonna have a problem me and you

AMY
Oh shishkebobs no If I gave you that
impression I am so sorry Actually I
was really hoping that we could be more

entire syllabus but thats not how I do
things Im not one of these stuffy
