A TELEVISION SET

-tuned to a DOCUMENTARY As an old fashioned World GLOBE
rotates in a sea of clouds the EIFFEL TOWER slowly comes
into view over the horizon dwarfing FRANCE underneath it

TV NARRATOR
Although each of the world’s
countries would like to dispute
this fact we French know the
truth the best food in the World
is made in France The best food in
France is made in Paris and the
best food in Paris some say is
made by Chef Auguste Gusteau

We see images of GUSTEAU cooking signing his cookbook in
front of his famous restaurant Gusteau is in his early
forties but his massive girth makes him look older

TV NARRATOR (CONTD)
Gusteau’s restaurant is the toast
of Paris booked five months in
advance and his dazzling ascent to
the top of Fine French Cuisine has
made his competitors envious He is
the youngest Chef ever to achieve a
five star rating Chef Gusteau’s
cookbook “Anyone Can Cook” has
climbed to the top of the best-
seller list But not everyone
celebrates its success

A tall gaunt severe-looking MAN with fish-belly white skin
appears on the TV screen SUPER ANTON EGO-FOOD CRITIC”
Beneath that in italics is his moniker The Grim Eater

EGO
Amusing title “Anyone Can Cook”
What’s even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe
it I on the other hand take
cooking seriously and no-- I don’t
think “anyone” can do it

FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

A light rain falls on a SMALL FARMHOUSE The last remaining
dead leaves tremble in the gusts The quiet is shattered by a
LOUD GUNSHOT that lights up the inside of the cottage CAMERA
pushes down and in toward a single window

RATATOUILLE

As we move closer we begin to hear muffled SOUNDS OF
STRUGGLE furniture being bumped dishes breaking an
indescribable CRASH followed by an OLD LADY’S SHRIEK

Were close to the WINDOW now when it is suddenly SHATTERED
by a COOKBOOK Instantly the action FREEZES

Underneath its splayed pages shielding himself from the
shards of splintering glass is inexplicably a RAT-

-REMY He’s scrawny frightened almost comic It’s hard not
to feel sympathetic towards the little guy

REMY (VO)

This is me I think it’s apparent I
need to rethink my life a little
bit What’s my problem First of
all--

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DUSK - WEEKS EARLIER

A SILHOUETTE darts out from behind a wooden barrel pausing
upright against a blood red sky Mangy sinister the
opposite of Remy This is how most humans see RATS

REMY (VO CONTD)
--I’m a rat Which means life is
hard

Assured the coast is clear the SINISTER RAT scampers out
into the yard followed by DOZENS MORE RATS The RATS move
across the expanse of grass toward a COMPOST HEAP which sits
in the middle of a field under the darkening sky

Resourceful and well coordinated the rats grab bits of
decomposing food and carry it off REMY is among them
drearily going through garbage
REMY (VO)
And secondly-- I have a highly
developed sense of taste and smell

Suddenly he catches a SCENT which leads him to uncover a
nearly untouched piece of PASTRY a discarded NAPOLEON

REMY
(sniffing Napoleon)
Flour eggs sugar vanilla bean
small twist of lemon

The Napoleon suddenly erupts and out pops Remy’s pudgy
brother EMILE covered in cream and completely oblivious to

the destruction he’s wrought

EMILE
You can smell all that Wow You
have a gift

Again the ACTION FREEZES

REMY (VO)
This is Emile My brother He’s
easily impressed

RESUME ACTION An older rat DJANGO comes into view He
snorts dismissively plucks an APPLE CORE from the compost

DJANGO
So you can smell ingredients So
what

REMY (VO)
This is my Dad He’s never
impressed He also happens to be
the leader of our clan

Remy catches another scent and FROWNS this new scent is
different somehow wrong He follows the scent to Django--

REMY (VO)
So what’s wrong with having highly
developed senses

Django is about to eat the APPLE CORE when Remy lunges at
him snatching the core from his hands

REMY
Whoa whoa whoa DON’T EAT THAT
SHED - MINUTES LATER

Still holding the APPLE CORE Remy sniffs the air following
a scent to a tarp in the corner He lifts it REVEALING a
can of RAT POISON The other rats REACT Django’s impressed

REMY (VO)
Turns out that funny smell was rat
poison Suddenly Dad didn’t think
my talent was useless I was
feeling pretty good about my gift
Until Dad gave me a job--

FARMHOUSE - COMPOST PILE - DAY

A line of rats file past REMY holding up rotted scraps of
food so that each one passes under his nose

REMY (VOCONT’ )
--that’s right-- “poison checker”

As Remy sniffs with all the gusto of a lifelong DMV employee
the line shuffles forward with each “clean”

REMY
(sniffs before each one)
Clean clean clean-erino
cleaneriffic close to Godliness--

The rat under inspection stands there unsure as to whether
or not he’s been approved

REMY (CONTD)
--which means “clean” You know--
“Cleanliness is close to--
(no response)
Remy waits expecting the rat to get his joke Beat

REMY (CONTD)
never mind Move on

The rat moves on Remy rolls resumes his bored inspection

INSIDE ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON

Django and Remy stand on a beat-up chair overlooking the rat
clan as they go about their day
REMY (VO)
Well it made my Dad proud

DJANGO
Now don’t you feel better Remy
You’ve helped a noble cause

REMY
Noble We’re thieves Dad And what
were stealing is-- let’s face it

garbage

DJANGO
It isn’t stealing if no one wants
it

REMY

If no one wants it why are we
stealing it

They continue to quarrel It’s clear this is an old argument

REMY (VO)
Let’s just say we have different
points of view

ATTIC - NIGHT

Django and Emile are gobbling up an assortment of RUBBISH
which is in fact dinner REMY watches them appalled He
looks down at his own plate in disgust

REMY (VO CONTD)
This much I knew if you are what
you eat then I only want to eat
the good stuff

He pushes the rotted food away Django reacts

REMY (VO)
But to my Dad--

DJANGO
Food is fuel You get picky about
what you put in the tank your
engine is gonna die Now shut up
and eat your garbage

REMY
If we’re going to be thieves why
not steal the good stuff in the
kitchen Where nothing is poisoned
DJANGO
First of all we are NOT thieves
Secondly Stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans It’s
dangerous

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DUSK

Remy watches the farmhouse drawn to the warm light and the
sounds emanating from inside

REMY (VO)
I know I’m supposed to hate humans
But there’s something about them

FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN
Remy carefully sneaks into the kitchen

REMY (VO CONT’)
-they don’t just survive they
discover they create Just look at
what they do with food

The TV is tuned to the same show we saw in the opening CHEF
GUSTEAU is cooking speaking to the camera Remy watches

GUSTEAU (ON TV)
Good food is like music you can
taste color you can smell There
is excellence all around you You
need only be aware to stop and
savor it

Remy notices a leftover plate of FRUITS and CHEESES He picks
up a small slice of cheese and takes a bite

REMY (VO)
Gusteau was right Each flavor was
totally unique

As Remy closes his eyes his surroundings FADE TO BLACK A
amorphus COLORED SHAPE appears above his head accompanied by
a cello bass line

REMY (VO CONT’)
Oh yeah Amazing But combine
one flavor with another--

Cheese still in his mouth Remy takes a bite of the
STRAWBERRY
REMY (CONT’D)
-and something new was created

New COLORED SHAPES and musical signatures appear swirling
and dancing in harmony with the others

A light SNAPS ON breaking the spell The OLD LADY has
awakened Remy drops the food and scampers away

FIELD — DAY

Remy follows a pleasant scent in the air It leads him to a
beautiful MUSHROOM

REMY (VO)
So now I had a secret life The
only one who knew about it was
Emile

BEHIND THE FARM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Emile is atop a full garbage can rooting around under the
lid Remy calls up from the tall grass below

REMY
Emile Psst- hey Emile--

Emile looks up holding the remains of a brown-bag lunch

REMY
(giddy )
Look I found a mushroom Come on
youre good at hiding food help me
find a good place to put this

GRASSY FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

Remy and Emile walk together Emile on all fours dragging
the enormous bag he grips between his teeth while Remy walks
upright carefully cradling his mushroom

REMY (VO)
He doesn’t under-stand me but I
can be myself around him

EMILE
Why are you walking like that
REMY
I don’t want to constantly have to
wash my paws Do you ever think
about how we walk on the same paws
that we handle food with Do you
ever think about what we put into
our mouths

EMILE
All the time

REMY
(he shudders )
When I eat I don’t want to taste
everywhere my paws have been

EMILE
Well okay But if Dad sees you
walking like that he’s not gonna
like it

Remy SNIFFS Emile’s BAG His eyes LIGHT UP

REMY
What have you got there

He disappears into the bag RIFLES through it emerging with--

REMY
Cheese You found CHEESE And not
just any cheese- Tomme De Chevre de
Pays That would go beautifully
with my mushroom And And and and-

He sniffs the air quickly finds a plant nearby He PLUCKS it
from the ground his excitement growing by the second

REMY (CONTD)
--this rosemary With maybe with--

He grabs a paw full of grass from the ground tasting the
milky base Smiling he squeezes a few drops on the mushroom

REMY (CONT’D)
-a few drops from this sweet grass

EMILE
Well throw it on the pile I
guess and we’1ll--

REMY
We don’t want to throw this in with
the garbage This is special
EMILE
But we gotta return to the colony
before sundown or Dad’s gonna--

REMY
Emile There are possibilities
unexplored here We’ve gotta cook
this Now exactly how we cook this
is the real questi--

Remy STOPS his gaze locking on the SMOKING CHIMNEY atop the
farmhouse roof He GRINS

REMY (CONT’D)
--ooooohh yeah Come on

ROOFTOP - LATER

Remy has skewered the mushroom and cheese onto part of the TV
antennae which he has bent over the smoking chimney top
hand turning it like a rotisserie

REMY
The key is to keep turning it get
the smoky flavor nice and even

Lightning flickers in the far distance followed a moment
later by a RUMBLE of thunder Emile watches concerned

EMILE
That storm’s getting closer Hey
you think that maybe we shouldn’t--

KRAAAK A BOLT OF LIGHTNING hits the TV antennae-- knocking
both rats off the rooftop They make a LONG FALL landing
with a THUD into a the soft dirt

Miraculously Remy and Emile are alive their smoking fur
sticks out in an electrified frazzle Remy holds the rod up
keeping the cheesy mushroom-- now transformed by lightning
into an amazing puffed out shape-- completely clean

REMY

(moaning)
Whoaaa ohhh

(idly bites mushroom)
--ohmmmmmnnn you gotta taste
this It’s got this kind of--

(smacks lips)

--burny melty-- it’s not really a
smoky flavor it’s a certain-- it’s
kind of like a--

(MORE)

REMY (contd)
(makes a sound effect)
--it’s got a--
(sound effect)
--kind of taste don’t you think
What would you call that flavor

EMILE
Lightning-y

REMY
Yeah It’s LIGHTNING-Y We’ve gotta
do that AGAIN Okay When the next
storm comes we’ll go up on the roof-

Remy’s eyes suddenly go BLANK with a pre-emptive thought
REMY

I KNOW WHAT THIS NEEDS Saffron a
little saffron would MAKE THIS

EMILE REMY and EMILE
Saffron Why do I get the (together )
feeling-- --it’s in the kitchen

FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Emile frets looking nervously at the old lady still fast
asleep in front of the TV Remy RUMMAGES through her spices

REMY
Saffron saffron hmn

EMILE
Not good Don’t like it She’s
gonna wake up

REMY
I’ve been down here a million
times She turns on the cooking
channel-- boom Never wakes up

EMILE
You’ve been here a million times

REMY
(resumes rooting)
I’m telling ya saffron’ll be just
the thing Gusteau swears by it

EMILE
Okay who’s Gusteau

Remy pushes aside some COOKBOOKS revealing a well-worn copy
of “AUGUST GUSTEAU’S ANYONE CAN COOK” on the shelf

EMILE
Wait-- you read

REMY
(guilty)
Well not excessively

EMILE
Oh man Does dad know

REMY
You could fill a book-- a LOT of
books-- with things dad doesn’t
know And they have Which is why I
read
(pointed)
Which is also our secret

He resumes rummaging through the spices Emile FRETS

EMILE
I don’t like secrets All this
cooking and reading and TV watching
while we read and cook It’s like
youre involving me in crime And I
let you Why do I let you

FARMHOUSE ATTIC - SAME MOMENT

RATS stream in from a crack in the wall throwing food from
the compost pile on to a heap DJANGO is at the center
overseeing things He turns away distracted--

DJANGO
What’s taking those kids so long

RESUME KITCHEN - REMY AND EMILE
Remy locates a tiny vial of saffron holds it up

REMY
Ah Aquila saffron Italian
Gusteau says it’s excellent Good
thing the old lady is a food lov--

Something on the TV attracts Remy’s attention the great Chef
Gusteau is being interviewed

REMY
--hey That’s Gusteau Emile look--

GUSTEAU (TV)
Great cooking is not for the faint
of heart You must be imaginative
strong-hearted you must try things
that may not work And you must not
let anyone define your limits
because of where you come from
Your only limit is your soul What
I say is true anyone can cook
but only the fearless can be great

Remy grins nodding in agreement

REMY
Pure poetry

TV NARRATOR
But it was not to last Gusteau’s
restaurant lost one of its five
stars after a scathing review by
France’s top food critic Arnot Ego

Remy drifts closer to the TV drawn to the shocking news

TV NARRATOR (CONTD)
It was a severe blow to Gusteau
and the great Chef died shortly
afterward which according to
tradition meant the loss of
another star

REMY
(stunned)
Gusteau is dead

Suddenly the TV SNAPS OFF Remy and Emile spin around to see--
the OLD LADY is awake and WIELDING A SHOT GUN

REMY
RUN

Remy and Emile SCATTER Emile panics races toward the attic

REMY
NO Youll lead her to the colony

The Lady BLASTS huge holes in the ceiling just behind the
scrambling Emile He LEAPS CLEAR-- and lands on the end of a
HANGING LIGHT FIXTURE The old lady has him She levels the
gun barrel at the helplessly dangling Emile--

REMY hides his eyes EMILE braces for the end-- CLICK

The shotgun is EMPTY The OLD LADY REACTS WHAT EMILE
REACTS Huh I’m not dead REMY LOOKS UP Emile is still
alive The OLD LADY curses ejecting the shells

EMILE SEES his opportunity starts SCRAMBLING to pull himself
up onto the light THE OLD LADY SEES THIS and rushes for more
shells REMY sees an opening and takes off to help Emile

Rifling through her desk drawers the OLD LADY SPIES REMY
coming out of hiding to help EMILE She REDOUBLES HER EFFORTS
to find a box of shells--

EMILE struggles his fat body up to the precarious LIGHT
FIXTURE

EMILE
Help Remy Help

REMY
Emile start swinging the light
Ill try to grab you

OLD LADY hears Remy calling for Emile but from her POV all
we hear is a SQUEAKING SOUND OLD LADY finds a SHELL BOX
EMPTY She YANKS OPEN another desk drawer

REMY arrives at the light fixture reaches out for EMILE--

REMY
Emile Swing to me

OLD LADY-- nothing in the drawer she decides to look in the
book shelf LOOKING BACK to see if the TWO RATS are still
together and struggling still sitting ducks--

Finding no shells in the desk the LADY goes for the cabinet
LOOKING BACK to the TWO sitting duck RATS The lady FINDS a
fresh box of SHELLS spilling them in her excitement--

REMY STRAINS to lift EMILE The LADY drops to her knees
picks up a shell loading it as EMILE’s feet get purchase
The LADY chambers her SHELL and SWINGS the SHOTGUN AROUND--

The RATS scramble up into a new blast hole at the base of a
hanging fixture It EXPLODES in buckshot

SILENCE then a loud CRACK--

The lady LOOKS UP a large FISSURE snakes across the ceiling
connecting the wide circle of SHOTGUN HOLES-

--a massive CHUNK OF CEILING breaks free and comes crashing
down-- bringing with it the FLOOR of the ATTIC above its
furniture and HUNDREDS OF SURPRISED RATS

The Old Lady FREAKS She runs from the room

DJANGO
EVACUATE EVERYONE TO THE BOATS

RATS grab assorted belongings as they make their escape Remy
and Emile run with the terrified mob Suddenly Remy stops
looks back to Gusteau’s COOKBOOK--

REMY
The book

--and TURNS BACK rushing into the flood of fleeing rats

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE
RATS are diving out the windows streaming through cracks
racing across the grass to the banks of a nearby stream
BY THE STREAM
The rats run into the tall grass pulling aside camouflage
REVEALING several WATERCRAFT built from junk The RATS push
them into the water and climb aboard DJANGO urges them on
DJANGO

GO GO GO MOVE MOVE MOVE
INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
Remy the last remaining rat struggles with GUSTEAU’S
COOKBOOK A strange BREATHING SOUND causes him to look up
the LADY is back now sporting a World War 2 GASMASK and GAS
CANNISTER She starts after Remy SPRAYING GAS everywhere
With a burst of adrenaline Remy hoists the COOKBOOK onto his
back and makes a running LEAP through the window--

OUTSIDE THE FARMOUSE

--and lands on the lawn in a shower of glass It appears the
COOKBOOK itself is struggling to catch up to the fleeing rats-

REMY
Wait Wait for me

ON THE RIVER

RAIN starts to fall The last RAT BOAT has shoved off from
shore but DJANGO’s boat lingers under the FOOTBRIDGE

DJANGO
Everybody here We have everybody
Wait a minute- where’s Remy

At the shore Remy throws the book into the water and starts
paddling toward the tunnel after the colony

REMY
Right here I’m coming I’m coming

DJANGO
Hold on son
(to other rats)
Give him something to grab on to

GIT a huge muscular lab rat grabs a SPATULA and hoists it
out over the water toward Remy

DJANGO (CONTD)
Come on boy

Remy reaches out desperately paddling with his other paw
DJANGO (CONTD)
Paddle son Come on reach for it
You can do it
Remy has almost reached the end of the spatula-- BLAM
A BLAST hits the water sends Remy flying backward The OLD

LADY has taken position at the footbridge above She FIRES at
Django’s boat-- missing as his boat enters the tunnel

DJANGO
Remy
REMY
Dad
DJANGO
Come on you can make it You can
make it

Remy climbs back aboard the cookbook and PADDLES into the
drainpipe before the LADY can get off a shot She CURSES

TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Remy paddles Ahead Django’s BOAT vanishes into the dark

REMY
Guys wait Stop Hold up Wait for
me Hold UP

Frightened SHOUTS echo into SILENCE

REMY
DAD
(no response)
Dad

Silence Remy strains to see into the darkness He begins to
make out SHAPES the channel forking into TWO TUNNELS

REMY
Which way

He paddles towards the right tunnel changes his mind veers
toward the left He paddles picking up speed Then he hears--

--a LOW RUMBLE He stops suddenly alert The rumble becomes
a ROAR Remy whirls PADDLES furiously the opposite
direction He’s headed toward the edge of a waterfall

But it’s too late Over the edge go Remy and the COOKBOOK
tumbling into the rapids below

Remy is tossed about like a rag doll buffeted in every
direction by the churning water He struggles for air--

--finally breaking the surface he GULPS a breath--

--and is PLUNGED back under The stone walls blur past him as
he claws back to the surface Through the tumult he spies his
one chance up ahead-- the COOKBOOK He swims toward it
finally catching it he pulls himself aboard

The rapids pass the waters become calm He looks back
amazed he’s still alive He collapses exhausted

DISSOLVE TO

SOMEWHERE IN THE SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

A soaked and exhausted Remy has pulled his battered cookbook
to the sewer bank It’s dark and cold it smells bad but
he’s safe Maybe the clan will find him He waits

LATER

The COOKBOOK has dried out a bit and there is just enough
light seeping through a grate above for Remy to read it

REMY (VO)
I waited For a sound a voice
a sign Something

Remy flips a crinkled page to a appetizing photo of pastry
His stomach GROWLS He looks away turning to a drawing of
GUSTEAU on the opposite page

The ILLUSTRATION comes to life speaking to Remy--

GUSTEAU
If you are hungry go up and look
around Remy Why do you wait and
mope

REMY
I’ve just lost my family All my
friends Probably forever

GUSTEAU
How do you know

REMY
Well I--
(what is he doing)
You are an illustration Why am
I talking to you

GUSTEAU
(shrugs)
You just lost your family All your
friends You are lonely

REMY
Yeah well you’re dead

GUSTEAU
Ah but that is no match for
wishful thinking If you focus on
what you’ve left behind you will
never be able to see what lies
ahead Now go up and look around

Remy looks up considering the streets above He looks back
to the illustration Gusteau has resumed his frozen pose
Remy decides to go

WE FOLLOW REMY

as he scurries up into a BUILDING-- between walls through
pipes under floorsallowing GLIMPSES into the HUMAN world
around him Remy moves through a crack emerges into--

APARTMENT KITCHEN

In the next room A PARTY is in progress Remy spies a loaf of
BREAD Famished he grabs it prepares to take a bite when-

--a SPRITE in the form of GUSTEAU appears smaller than Remy
glowing and semi-transparent

GUSTEAU
What are you doing

REMY
(startled defensive)
I’m hungry I don’t know where I am
and I don’t know when I’1l find
food again

GUSTEAU
Remy You are better than that You
are a cook Cooks make Thieves
take You are not a thief

REMY
(reconsidering)
But I am hungry
GUSTEAU
Food will come Remy Food always
comes to those who love to cook
The GUSTEAU SPRITE VANISHES Remy shakes it off He puts the
bread down denying his growing hunger and moves on

BETWEEN THE WALLS

Remy MOVES following his exceptional nose We see glimpses
of many French lives

A PAINTER carefully paints a nude model we can’t see--
An DOG barks aggressively warning Remy away from his flat--

A LOVERS QUARREL Remy watches from above through a crack in
the ceiling SHE shakily waves a pistol at a defiant HE

QUARRELING WOMAN
You think I am playing Francois
You think I am PLAYING

QUARRELING MAN
You don’t have the guts

Losing interest Remy moves on A BULLET splinters the floor
in front of him Remy rushes back to the crack and SEES--

--the couple struggling with the smoking gun The MAN
wrenches it free it clatters to the floor They glare at
each other blood in their eyes--

--and KISS Remy rolls his eyes and moves on through dark
tight spaces into a pipe and emerges onto--

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - ROOFTOPS - DUSK

CAMERA follows as Remy scampers along railings and ledges
past windows up vines BOOMING UP as the ROOFTOP FALLS AWAY
TO REVEAL--—

A STUNNING PANORAMA PARIS AT NIGHT
It is GORGEOUS-- a vast luminous jewel Remy is GOBSMACKED

REMY
Paris All this time I’ve been
underneath PARIS It’s beautiful

Remy’s takes in the sea of shimmering lights then sees a
HUGE SIGN atop a building several blocks away It’s GUSTEAU--
a frying pan in each hand The SIGN marvels at the panorama

GUSTEAU SIGN
The MOST beautiful

REMY
Gusteau’s Your restaurant You’ve
led me to your restaurant

GUSTEAU SIGN
(not entirely sure)
It seems as though I have Yes
There it is I have led you to it

REMY
I gotta see this

Remy heads off toward the restaurant

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT

WAITERS and COOKS bustle back and forth preparing elaborate
meals with energetic precision the complex dance of Haute
Cuisine Professional cooking at its finest

While the COOKS range wildly in age and nationality only one
is female a French cook in her late twenties named COLETTE

A small nasty-looking MAN sporting a thin mustache and a
toque almost as large as the rest of him ENTERS This is the
head Chef SKINNER Several COOKS call out greetings to him
He looks annoyed as LA ROUSSE nudges him

LA ROUSSE
Hey boss Look who’s here This is
Linguini Renata’s little boy

La Rousse gestures to LINGUINI a gawky young man with a
unruly mop of red hair sitting on a stool in the corner He
jumps up and awkwardly approaches Skinner

LA ROUSSE (CONT’D)
All grown up eh You remember
Renata Gusteau’s old flame

SKINNER
(distracted)
Ahh yes How are you uh

LA ROUSSE
Linguini

SKINNER
Yes Linguini So nice of you to
visit How is--

LINGUINI
My mother

SKINNER
Yes

LA ROUSSE

SKINNER
(impatient)
Yes Renata How is she
LINGUINI
Good Well not g-- she’s been

HORST
She died

SKINNER

Oh I’m sorry

LINGUINI
Don’t be She believed in heaven so
she’s covered
(awkward)

Skinner stares at Linguini for a long perplexed moment
Linguini suddenly hands a sealed envelope to him

SKINNER
What’s this

LINGUINI
She left it for you I think she
hoped it would help Me Get a job
Here--—

LA ROUSSE
Of course Gusteau wouldn’t
hesitate Any son of Renata’s--

SKINNER
(cutting him off)
Yes Well we could file this and
if something suitable opens up--

LA ROUSSE
Weve already hired him

SKINNER
(outraged)
What How dare you hire someone
without my-

HORST
We needed a garbage boy

Skinner processes this calming as he does

SKINNER
Oh Garbage Well
(to Linguini thin smile)
I’m glad it worked out

Skinner disappears into his office which once belonged to
the great Gusteau himself Linguini turns back to the other
cooks who are already handing him his work clothes

ROOFTOP - ABOVE GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Remy and the Gusteau sprite look down through the SKYLIGHT
into GUSTEAU’S kitchen Remy watches rapt as the CHEFS
scurry about preparing the gourmet meals

REMY
I can’t believe it A real gourmet
kitchen and I get to watch

GUSTEAU
Youve read my book Let us see how
much you know Which is the Chef

Remy points out SKINNER who is berating another cook

REMY
That guy

GUSTEAU
Very good Who is next in command

REMY
The Sous Chef there
(points out HORST)
The Sous is responsible for the
kitchen when the Chef’s not there

REMY’S POV ISOLATING THE COOKS as Remy points them out

REMY (0C)
Saucier in charge of sauces very
important Chef de Partie Demi-
Chef de Partie-- both important
(pointing)
Commis Commis Commis they’re
cooks Very important

GUSTEAU
You are a clever rat Now-- who is
that

Gusteau is pointing at the garbage boy LINGUINI who is
clumsily steering a mop and bucket through the kitchen

REMY
Oh him He’s nobody

GUSTEAU
Not nobody He is part of the
kitchen

REMY

(dismissive)
He’s a Plongeur or something
Washes dishes or takes out the
garbage He doesn’t cook

GUSTEAU
But he could

Below LINGUINI accidentally knocks over the pot of soup
spilling it Remy gives Gusteau a patronizing chuckle

REMY
No

What WE SEE but Remy doesn’t desperate that no one notices
his mistake Linguini quickly replaces the pot on the burner
and MOPS up the floor

GUSTEAU
How do you know What do I always
say “Anyone can cook”

REMY
Well yeah Anyone can That
doesn’t mean that anyone should

GUSTEAU
Well that is not stopping him See

Remy watches aghast as Linguini quickly chums some water from
another pot into the soup to refill it to it’s former level
haphazardly throws in a few spices and vegetables

REMY
No This is terrible He’s ruining
the soup And nobody’s noticing
It’s your restaurant Do something

GUSTEAU
What can I do I am a figment of
your imagination-

REMY
But HE’S RUINING THE SOUP We’ve
got to tell someone that he’s R-

The skylight suddenly gives way and Remy PLUNGES down--

GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN

With a SPLASH Remy lands in a sink filled with soapy
dishwater He paddles to the surface climbs onto the counter
and tumbles over the edge hitting the floor with a SPLAT

KITCHEN FLOOR - UNDER THE COUNTER - CONTINUOUS

Remy HIDES GIANT FEET (belonging to busy COOKS) boom by on
either side Surrounded by the enemies of rat kind Remy is
PETRIFIED From REMY’S POV the kitchen is a terrifying place
full of FIRE and NOISE He runs out from under the counter

The door to the walk-in OPENS knocking Remy across the floor
and under the stove Above him rows of burners IGNITE

He races across a walkway under another counter and out the
other side nearly run over by a DINING CART REMY dives
underneath it using it to cross the kitchen camouflaged

Sticking his head out Remy spots an OPEN WINDOW on the far
wall a way out He runs for it climbing up a dish rack to
the counter He is nearly to the OPEN WINDOW

He scrambles up onto a copper pot toward it but the lid
slips and he falls inside He LOOKS UP
REMY’S POV OUT FROM UNDER THE POT LID

--the window is MOVING AWAY What’s happening

WIDEN TO REVEAL--

--the POT is being carried away by one of the COOKS The chef
sets the pot down near a stove and exits As Remy heads back
toward the window a wonderful SCENT hits his nose He
SNIFFS following it to a PAN filled with vegetables

Enticed he crawls inside and it is only then that he
notices the LARGE TURKEY-- moments before a COOK picks up the
pan and slides it into the oven

Remy barely escapes before the oven door CLOSES SPRINGING
from the oven to another passing trolley which bursts into--

THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Remy is wheeled into the plush hush of the restaurant and
pulls up to a table of well-dressed DINERS A WAITERS HAND
reaches down for a peppermill grabbing REMY instead--
--which startles both of them The HAND instantly RELEASES

Remy who quickly leaps on to another passing trolley the
one heading back to the kitchen

GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Remy jumps off the trolley and hides He looks up at the
window --

REMY’S POV

--the WINDOW has been CLOSED Linguini crosses into his view
and tastes the soup It’s horrible so horrible that--

--he runs to the window opens it SPITS the soup out into
the alley and exits-- LEAVING THE WINDOW OPEN

RESUME REMY

He sees his opening and runs for it climbing a broom handle
to a shelf above the stove that leads to the OPEN WINDOW

Dodging jars of spices he runs through the steam from the
soup bubbling directly below It’s so disgusting that--

--without thinking he grabs a spice from the counter throws
a dash in He starts for the window-- thinks better of it
adds some leeks adds some pepper starts back to the window--

--and STOPS

His gaze returns to the boiling pot He looks back at the
kitchen the cooks haven’t noticed him He looks at the
window it is still open and the path to it is clear

The GUSTEAU SPRITE APPEARS--

GUSTEAU
Remy What are you waiting for

REMY
Is this going to become a regular
thing with you

GUSTEAU
You know how to fix it This is
your chance

Remy considers this Then filled with purpose he jumps to
the stove top turns the burner down hops up to the spigot
to add water to the soup

Quickly losing himself Remy proceeds to remake the soup
alternately smelling tasting and adding ingredients to it
He grabs a pawful of spices to toss in and SUDDENLY SEES--

--LINGUINI wide-eyed and brandishing a ladle They STARE at
each other for a long moment deer caught in each others
headlights Remy drops the spices into the soup

Skinner (OS)
THE SOUP WHERE IS THE SOUP

The two STARTLE Remy tries to run for the window Linguini
slams a collander over him both hiding and trapping him

Skinner
Out of my way Garbage boy

Skinner spots the ladle in Linguini’s hand He seizes
Linguini by his collar

Skinner
You are COOKING How dare you cook
in my kitchen

Remy starts to push the collander toward the open window

SKINNER
Where do you get the gall to even
attempt something so monumentally
idiotic I should have you drawn
and quartered I’1l do it I think
the law is on my side

(calling out)
LaRousse Draw and quarter this
man AFTER you put his head in the
duck press to squeeze the fat out

As Skinner berates Linguini LALO ladles the soup into a
tureen which he takes to the pass Linguini watches
helplessly as the waiter MUSTAFA carries his soup out to the
dining room

LINGUINI SKINNER
Oh no no no ohhhh nooo-- What are you blathering
about

LINGUINI SKINNER
(points dumbstruck) Soup
-but don’t let- th-- sou (suddenly understands)
soup-- STOP THAT SOUP Noooo

But Mustafa is gone and it is TOO LATE Skinner anxiously
looks through the door windows into the dining room--
SKINNER’S POV THE DINING ROOM
--the soup is served to a WOMAN DINER She tastes it REACTS
visibly and motions for the waiter
RESUME KITCHEN - GUSTEAU and SKINNER
Wilting Skinner turns his building rage toward Linguini
Skinner
Linguini You’re FIRED F-I-R-E-D
FIRED

MUSTAFA the waiter sticks his head through the double-
doors speaking low to Skinner

MUSTAFA
She wants to speak to the Chef

Color drains from Skinner’s face He sighs heads out into
the dining room to take his medicine Linguini creeps toward
the exit but is collared by the Sous Chef HORST

On the counter Remy inches the collander towards the window
Colette sticks a spoon into the soup and tastes It’s GOOD

Mustafa and Skinner re-enter from the dining room Skinners
face a riot of bewilderment

COLETTE
What did the customer say
MUSTAFA
It wasn’t a customer It was a
critic
COLETTE
(fearful)
Ego
SKINNER
(dazed)

Solene LeClaire

COLETTE
LeClaire What did she say

MUSTAFA
She liked the soup

UNDER THE COLLANDER
The GUSTEAU SPRITE stops Remy

GUSTEAU
Wait--

REMY
What do mean “wait’ You’re the
reason I’m in this mess

GUSTEAU
Someone is asking about your soup

RESUME SCENE

The bustle of the kitchen has STOPPED DEAD as Skinner tastes
the soup His eyes betray a truth the soup is delicious And
he HATES that He turns to Linguini his face DARK

SKINNER
What are you playing at

LINGUINI
(totally confused)
I uhm didn’t-- am I still fired

COLETTE
You can’t fire him
SKINNER
(wheels on her)
What--
COLETTE

LeClaire likes it She made a point
of telling you so If she writes a
review to that effect and finds

out you fired the cook responsible--

SKINNER
He’s a garbage boy

COLETTE
--who made something she liked How
can we claim to represent the name
of Gusteau if we don’t uphold his
most cherished belief

SKINNER
What belief is that Madamoiselle
Tatou

COLETTE

Anyone can cook

UNDER THE COLLANDER

The Gusteau sprite NUDGES Remy

RESUME SCENE

The other COOKS murmur their assent The turn of the tide
isn’t lost on Skinner His face softens into an icy smile

SKINNER
Perhaps I’ve been a bit harsh on
our new garbage boy He has taken a
bold risk and we should reward
that as Chef Gusteau would have
If he wishes to swim in dangerous
waters who are we to deny him

UNDER THE COLLANDER

Remy’s totally absorbed in this conflict A COUGH causes Remy
to looks up the GUSTEAU SPRITE gestures at the window

GUSTEAU
You were escaping

REMY
Oh Yeah--

Remy resumes pushing toward the window

BACK TO SCENE

Skinner turns to Colette gives her a withering smile

SKINNER
Since you have expressed such an
interest in his cooking career you
should be responsible for it

Colette’s face falls Skinner turns to the other cooks

SKINNER
Anyone else
(they look away)
Then back to work--

The cooks resume their work Skinner wheels on Linguini

SKINNER
You are either very lucky or very
UNlucky You will make the soup
again and this time I’1l be paying
attention Very close attention

Off to the side REMY has almost made it to the window

SKINNER (CONT’D)
They think you might be a cook But
you know what I think Linguini I
think you’re a sneaky overreaching

little-
(he SPIES REMY)
--RAAAAT

REMY RUNS The OTHER COOKS come after him Skinner SWINGS a
MOP at Remy breaking dishes and blocking his escape

SKINNER
Linguini Get a something to trap
it in

Linguini CLAPS a jar over Remy Seals it

LINGUINI
What should I do now
SKINNER
Kill it
LINGUINI
Now
SKINNER

No Not in the kitchen are you
mad Do you know what would happen
to us if anyone knew we had a rat
in our kitchen

(MORE)

SKINNER (contd)
They’d close us down Our
reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is Take it away from here
far away Kill it dispose of it
Go

Linguini nods and quickly EXITS the kitchen’s back door

ALLEY BEHIND GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Linguini hops aboard a bicycle and peddles into the gloom
carrying Remy in the jar with him

ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT

The waterfront normally so beautiful seems dark and
forboding this night Linguini slows his bicycle and pulls up
under a street lamp near a bridge underpass He climbs off
the bicycle and prepares to drop the jar into the water

Remy is PETRIFIED His heart racing he presses his paws
against the glass staring at Linguini with terrified eyes

Linguini HESITATES then PULLS BACK shouting at Remy

LINGUINI
Don’t look at me like that You
aren’t the only one who’s trapped
They expect me to cook it again
(Remy looks up HUH)
I’m not ambitious I wasn’t trying
to cook I was just trying to stay
out of trouble You’re the one who
was getting fancy with the spices
What’d you throw in there Oregano
(Remy SHAKES HEAD “NO”)
No What rosemary
(Again Remy shakes head)
That’s a spice isn’t it Rosemary
(At this Remy NODS)
You didn’t put rosemary in there

Remy shakes his head Linguini SLUMPS down on the bank sets
the Remy jar next to him

LINGUINI
I need this job I’ve lost so many
I don’t know how to cook and now
I’m talking to a rat as if you
actually understand what I’m say--
(sudden realization)
--did you NOD You UNDERSTAND ME
(MORE)

LINGUINI (contd)
Remy NODS)
So I’m not crazy Wait a second
wait a second I can’t cook Can I
Remy shakes his head)
But you can Right
Remy thinks uncertainly)
Don’t be so modest you’re a rat
for Pete’s sake Whatever you did
they liked it
lost in thought)
Yeah This could work Hey they
liked the soup--

With an expansive gesture Linguini accidentally KNOCKS REMY’S
JAR INTO THE SEINE Horrified Linguini DIVES IN after it

JUMP CUT TO

ALONG BANKS OF SEINE - MINUTES LATER

Linguini sits on a bench soaking wet the jar with Remy
successfully retrieved and sitting next to him

LINGUINI

They liked the soup You think you
could do it again

(Remy NODS)
I’m gonna let you go But we’re
together on this Right

(Remy NODS again)
Okay

Linguini sets the jar down on its side and carefully OPENS
the lid Remy looks up at him and TAKES OFF escaping
into the darkness CACKLING as he runs Remy LOOKS BACK at-
REMY’S POV PULLING AWAY FROM LINGUINI

--who stands forlorn and alone under the bridge

WITH REMY

He slows to a stop moved by this pitiful sight

WITH LINGUINI

He SIGHS defeated Turns sadly to his bicycle Then a SOUND
the CLICKING of tiny claws on cement Linguini looks up--

REMY very cautiously is coming toward him back into the
light Remy looks at Linguini who SMILES

LINGUINI’S FLAT - NIGHT

Darkness we hear KEYS fumbling in a lock Linguini KICKS the
warped door a few times opening it enough to enter and
wrestle his bicycle through He turns on a light REVEALING--

-a tiny odd-shaped room two doors in the wall one a
bathroom the other a closet both tiny One window a table
with two chairs Hotplate A miniscule ancient refrigerator

A ratty couch doubles as a bed a portable black and white tv
rests precariously on one arm

LINGUINI

This is it It’s not much but it’s-

(he looks around)
--not much

(to Remy shrugs)
Could be worse there’s heat and
light and a couch with a TV So
y’know-- what’s mine is yours

Remy looks over the new digs He likes them just fine

LATER

Fast asleep on the couch Linguini is bathed in the
flickering light from an old and very romantic FRENCH MOVIE
on TV TWO LOVERS stand handsomely in the swirling steam of a
soon to depart locomotive staring into each other’s eyes--

HER (TV) HIM (TV)
Are you-- is this a dream The best kind of dream One
we can share

Tucked in to an OVEN MITT near the window sill REMY gazes
dreamily at the lights of Paris The romantic MOVIE MUSIC
swells underscoring his emotions

HER (OS TV) HIM (OS TV)
But why here Why now Why not here Why not now
What better place to dream
than in Paris

Remy grins slowly closes his eyes Dreaming

ee

LINGUINI’S FLAT - MORNING

Linguini AWAKENS with a start He looks up at the oven mitt--

LINGUINI
Morning little Chef Rise and sh--

--and suddenly realizes REMY IS GONE

LINGUINI
Idiot I knew this would happen I
let a rat into my place and tell
him what’s mine is his

Linguini yanks open the refrigerator door and looks inside

LINGUINI
Eggs GONE STUPID He’s stolen food
and hit the road What’d I expect
That’s what I get for trusting a ra-

As Linguini moves around the tiny alcove HE SEES--

--REMY quite pleased with himself as he cooks omelettes on
the hotplate Two places have been set at the tiny table

LINGUINI
Wh-- Hey What-- is that for me

Remy nods and deftly (but with considerable effort) sets the
large omelette onto Linguini’s plate Linguini sits and puts
a forkful into his mouth

LINGUINI
It’s good What’d you put in this
(Remy holds up basil leaf)
Where’d you get that

Remy moves to the window and points to the roof garden of a
nearby flat Linguini looks down at the enterprising rat

LINGUINI
Look It’s delicious But don’t
steal I’1l buy some spices okay

Remy shrugs and turns to eat Linguini glances at his clock

LINGUINI
Oh no We’re gonna be late and on
the first day

Linguini SHOVES the rest of the eggs into his mouth and grabs
his coat Famished Remy opens wide ready for his first bite
of food when Linguini snatches him up---

LINGUINI
Ca’mon little Chef

--and runs out of the apartment

GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN - MORNING

The cooks are circled around Colette listening with interest
as she reads a review aloud from the morning paper

COLETTE
“Though I like many other critics
had written off Gusteau’s as
irrelevant since the great Chef’s
death the soup was a revelation a
spicy yet subtle taste experience”

Skinner has ENTERED and is now stopped in his tracks

SKINNER
(stunned)
LeClaire

COLETTE
Yes
(resumes reading)
Against all odds Gusteau’s has
recaptured our attention Only time
will tell if they deserve it”

IN ALLEY OUTSIDE GUSTEAU’S

Linguini waits outside Remy in palm staring uncomfortably
at the kitchen entrance working up the nerve to go inside

LINGUINI
Well uhm

Aware he can’t enter the kitchen carrying a rat Linguini
looks half heartedly for places to conceal Remy under his
shirt up his sleeves in his sock-- rejecting each in turn

Out of ideas Linguini slowly opens the top of his pants
Remy looks up at him APPALLED

LINGUINI
(desperate)
Look I know it’s weird and stupid
but neither of us can do this
alone So we gotta do it together
right You with me

Remy gives a reluctant NOD Linguini glares at the kitchen
entrance psyching himself up--

LINGUINI
So LETS DO THIS THING

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S

The back door SLAMS OPEN All heads swing to a slightly
crazed LINGUINI standing in the doorway He wilts a bit with
the attention and attempts to cross inconspicuously to his
station the hidden rat causing a strangely spastic lurch

The other COOKS watch with bewildered amusement

Linguini arrives at his station and looks uneasily at the new
TOQUE resting there his new toque He swallows placing it
on his head and suddenly notices Skinner standing there

SKINNER
Welcome to hell Now recreate
the soup Take as long as you need
all week if you must

Skinner EXITS Linguini looks at his station with dread a
blocked writer facing a blank page

LINGUINI
Soup

LINGUINI’S STATION - MINUTES LATER

Raw soup stock bubbles at a low boil on the stove Linguini
stares at the variety carefully prepared of ingredients--
herbs spices diced vegetables etc that have been and laid
out at his station He’s completely unsure of where to start

REMY peeks out from Linguini’s collar and examines the scene
He scrambles underneath Linguini’s shirt and across his
chest tickling him Linguini LAUGHS

Remy’s head pops out from Linguini’s SHIRT CUFF sees
Linguini reaching for a SPICE TIN the WRONG spice Remy
signals Linguini to stop but Linguini pays no attention so--

--Remy gives Linguini’s HAND a NIP Linguini YELPS-- dropping
the entire spice tin INTO THE SOUP Appalled Remy gives
Linguini an admonishing bite--

Linguini YELPS and CURSES SWATS Remy in retaliation Remy
scurries to the other arm (GIGGLE) and gives Linguini another
nip (more YELPS and CURSINGS)

The OTHER COOKS marvel at the strangeness of the spastic
giggling yelping Linguini Visibly panicked the
gigglingyelping Linguini TURNS lurching from his station to
the food safe and closing himself inside

INSIDE FOOD VAULT - CONTINUOUS

Linguini RIPS his shirt open exposing his chest and arms
which are covered in angry red BITE MARKS

LINGUINI
AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH
(looks at Remy accusingly)
AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH
(gestures at bite marks)
AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH

Remy stares at the nearly hysterical Linguini

LINGUINI

This is NOT gonna work little
chef I am gonna LOSE IT if we do
this any more We gotta figure out
something else Something that
doesn’t involve any biting or
nipping or running up and down my
body with your little rat feet The
biting NO Scampering NO No
scampering or scurrying
Understand little chef

(beat)
Little chef

Remy’s gaze has drifted away from Linguini to the shelves
LOADED with premium food Remy looks weak with longing

LINGUINI
Oh you’re hungry

Guilty Linguini breaks a chunk from a round of cheese and
offers it to Remy who scarfs it down Linguini calmer now
straightens his clothes as he thinks out loud

LINGUINI
Okay the way I see it you know
how to cook And I know how to

appear human We just need to
work out a system so that I do what
you want in a way that doesn’t look
like I’m being controlled by a tiny
rat chef oh WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME
I’M INSANE I’M INSANE I’M INSIDE A
REFRIGERATOR TALKING TO A RAT ABOUT
GOURMET COOKING I WILL NEVER PULL
THIS OFF--

KITCHEN - OUTSIDE FOOD VAULT
Passing the food vault Skinner hears a VOICE from within
SKINNER
Linguini
INSIDE FOOD VAULT
Remy still eating listens as Linguini pours his heart out
LINGUINI
-we gotta communicate I can’t be
checking for a yes or no head shake

from a rat th-

Suddenly the vault door JERKS OPEN THREE THINGS HAPPEN FAST

1) Skinner sees a fleeting glimpse of LINGUINI WITH REMY
2) Linguini HITS THE LIGHT SWITCH-- the room GOES DARK
3) Skinner instantly FLICKS THE LIGHTS BACK ON to see--

--Linguini standing exactly as before But Remy is GONE

SKINNER
The rat I saw it

LINGUINI
No a rat

SKINNER
(searching about Linguini)
Yes yes-- a rat Right next to you-
(stops suspicious)
--what ARE YOU DOING IN HERE

LINGUINI
I’m just familiarizing myself with--
yknow the vegetables and such

SKINNER
Get out

Linguini makes a hasty exit Skinner calls out after him
SKINNER
ONE CAN GET TOO FAMILIAR WITH
VEGETABLES YOU KNOW
KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Linguini speaks to Remy who he’s hidden under his TOQUE--
LINGUINI
That was close You okay up there
INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy’s surroundings are visible through the thin fabric He
looks up AND SEES they are about to COLLIDE with--

--a WAITER CARRYING A TRAY PILED WITH DISHES Remy YANKS BACK
LINGUINI’S HAIR like horses REINS CAUSING-

LINGUINI

--to jerk backwards in an impossible limbo-arch pivoting
under the tray of dishes--

--and BACK UP AGAIN miraculously averting disaster Linguini
blinks in amazement what just happened He ducks into the--
BATHROOM

LINGUINI removes his toque looks at Remy in the mirror

LINGUINI
How did you do that

Still grasping hanks of Linguini’s hair in his paws Remy
SHRUGS Linguini’s shoulders SHOOT UP to his ears Startled
Remy drops his arms Linguini’s shoulders drop

LINGUINI
Whooaah--

A gleam comes into the rats’ eyes He JERKS the left hank
causing Linguini’s LEFT ARM to SHOOT UP IN THE AIR

LINGUINI
(marveling)
Wow That’s strangely involuntaREEE-

Remy is yanking tufts of Linguini’s hair like a kid with a
new toy Linguini jerks around like a helpless puppet

Remy stops looks at the panting Linguini in the mirror

REMY (VO)
One look and I knew each of us had
the same crazy idea

LINGUINI’S FLAT - NIGHT (MONTAGE LEARNING TO COOK)

Using hanks of Linguini’s hair to control Linguini’s actions
Remy pilots Linguini(who is blindfolded to keep him from
cheating) through an increasingly complex series of cooking
tasks everything from cutting vegetables to flipping crepes

During this comic montage we see Remy learning precisely how
to pilot Linguini and at the same time Linguini is learning
how to surrender himself to being “piloted”

By dawn Linguini and Remy have meshed into one finely honed
cooking machine

DISSOLVE TO

KITCHEN - NEXT DAY

Linguini stands off to the side fretting as Skinner pulls a
ladle of soup from a Linguini’s pot and tastes it

SKINNER
Congratulations You were able to
repeat your accidental success But
you will need to know more than
soup if you are to survive in my
kitchen boy Colette--

Skinner gestures to COLETTE who watches with a scowl
SKINNER (CONTD)
--will be responsible for teaching

you how we do things here

Skinner grins and EXITS Linguini crosses to Colette

LINGUINI
(a little too smooth)
Listen I just want you to know how
honored I am to be studying under a-

Colette STABS a knife through Linguini’s shirtsleeve pinning
it to the table Her voice is low intense

COLETTE
No you listen I just want you to
know exactly who you are dealing
with How many women do you see in
this kitchen

LINGUINI
Well I hah--- um--

She brings a second knife down through Linguini’s sleeve--

COLETTE
Only me Why do you think that is
LINGUINI
(spooked sputtering)
Well huh-- I hoo
COLETTE

Because Haute Cuisine is an
antiquated hierarchy built upon
rules written by stupid old men
rules designed to make it
impossible for women to enter this
world But still I am here How did
this happen

Linguini burbles in a desperate attempt at nonchalance

LINGUINI
Because you ah-- hah

Colette SLAMS a third knife through Linguini’s sleeve
thoroughly pinning it Linguini is truly frightened

COLETTE
Because I’m the toughest cook in
this kitchen I’ve worked too hard
for too long to get here and I’m
not going to jeopardize it for some
garbage boy who got lucky Got it

Linguini NODS pathetically Colette pulls the knife handles
out with a single JERK and Linguini topples to the floor
Colette EXITS Linguini peeks over the counter dazzled

LINGUINI
Wow

SKINNER’S OFFICE

Skinner watches as ad man FRANCOIS DUPUIS finishes pitching
his campaign for the latest GUSTEAU’S FROZEN FOOD product

The trademark Chef Gusteau art has been re-painted Gusteau
now sports a kimono coolie hat and chopsticks Behind this
are similar campaigns for GUSTEAU’S FRENCH PIZZA and
GUSTEAU’S MICROWAVE BURRITOS Skinner is captivated

DUPUIS
“Easy to cook easy to eat Gusteau
makes Chinese food ‘Chine-Easy’”
SKINNER

Excellent work Francois as usual

DUPUIS
It’s good isn’t it

Skinner stands offering a handshake to signal the end of the
meeting As Francois packs up his portfolio preparing to
leave Skinner straightens the photo of himself with Gusteau
that hangs on the wall

SKINNER
I want you to work up something for
my latest frozen food concept
“Gusteau’s Corn Puppies” Like corn
dogs only smaller bite size

DUPUIS
(starts sketching in pad)
What are corn dogs

SKINNER
Cheap sausages dipped in batter and
deep fried You know American
Whip something up maybe Gusteau in
overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat-

DUPUIS
(displaying his sketch)
Or as a giant ear of corn in doggie
makeup

SKINNER
Yes but with dignity

Dupuis EXITS Skinner moves to his desk and the stack of
UNOPENED MAIL there and begins to shuffle through it bill
bill bill-- and the PINK ENVELOPE given to him by Linguini

He opens the envelope and reads his bored eyes growing wider
and wider with each line He GASPS seizing the phone

SKINNER
Get my lawyer--

SKINNER’S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER
Skinner’s lawyer TALON LABARTHE is reading GUSTEAU’S WILL

TALON
The will stipulates that if after
a period of two years from the date
of death no heir appears Gusteau’s
business interests-- including the
restaurant and the rights to his
name and image-- will pass to his
Sous Chef You

SKINNER
I know what the will stipulates
(brandishing letter)
What I want to know is if this
letter if this boy changes
anything

Skinner raises the window blinds revealing a view of the
kitchen and Linguini who looks unusually awkward among the
practiced cooking staff Talon looks from Linguini to a
framed photo of GUSTEAU

TALON
There’s not much resemblance--

SKINNER
(drops blinds)
There’s NO resemblance at all He’s
not Gusteau’s son Gusteau had no
children And what of the timing of
all this The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month

Talon drifts around the office searching for something

SKINNER (CONT’D)
Suddenly some boy arrives with a
letter from his “recently deceased”
mother claiming Gusteau as his
father Highly suspect

Talon spies a TOQUE inside a DISPLAY CASE He turns to
Skinner

TALON
This is Gusteau’s
(Skinner NODS)
May I

SKINNER
Of course of course

Talon carefully opens the display case removes GUSTEAU’S
TOQUE and begins to inspect it

TALON
But the boy does not know

SKINNER
(brandishing the letter)
She claims she never told him-- OR
Gusteau And asks that I not tell

TALON
Why you What does she want

Talon spies something on the toque a HAIR He pulls a pair
of TWEEZERS from his coat removes the hair folding it
carefully inside a handkerchief and pocketing it

SKINNER
A job For the boy

TALON
Only a job

SKINNER
Well yes

TALON
Then what are you worried about If
he works here you’1ll be able to
keep an eye on him while I doa
little digging find out how much
of this is real

(getting his coat)

I’1l need you to collect some DNA
samples from the boy hair maybe

SKINNER
The whole thing is HIGHLY SUSPECT
He KNOWS something

TALON
Relax He’s a garbage boy I think
you can handle him

Talon exits Skinner stands inert spooked

KITCHEN

Linguini finishes dicing a red pepper He sets down his
knife carefully scoops up the small pile of dicings walks
over to a giant pot and drops it in returning to repeat the
procedure Colette who has watched this interrupts--

COLETTE
What are you doing

LINGUINI
I’m cutting Vegetables I’m
cutting the vegetables

COLETTE
NO You waste energy and time

Colette slides a chair up to the end of Linguini’s prep table
and slams the pot down on its seat so that the top is level
with the table’s surface

COLETTE
You think cooking is a cute job
huh Like mommy in the kitchen

She snatches Linguini’s KNIFE from him with one hand several
vegetables with the other With frightening speed she dices
them flicking each diced pile into the pot with the knife
dice flick dice flick--

COLETTE
Well mommy never had to face the
dinner rush when the orders come
flooding in and every dish is
different and none are simple and
all have different cooking times
but must arrive on the customers
table at exactly the same time hot
and perfect Every second counts--

In MOMENTS Colette has completed a ten-minute Linguini job

COLETTE (CONTD)
--and you CAN NOT BE MOMMY

TIME CUT ANOTHER DAY

Linguini is cooking He takes a pan off the burner and sets
it to one side which is already cluttered with utensils
Colette sees the mess and is outraged

COLETTE
What is this

Linguini stammers Colette quickly clears his station
pitching it all into a sink full of dishwater

COLETTE

Keep your station clear When the
meal rush comes what will happen
Messy stations slow things down
food doesn’t go orders pile up--
disaster I’1l make this easy to
remember keep your station
clear or I WILL KILL YOU

TIME CUT Colette grabs Linguini by the arm and holds up his
sleeves which are smeared with multi-colored STAINS

COLETTE

Your sleeves look like you threw up
on them Keep your hands and arms
in close to the body like this--

(she demonstrates)
--see Always return to this
position Cooks move fast sharp
utensils hot metal keep your arms
in you will minimize cuts and
burns and keep your sleeves clean
Mark of a chef messy apron clean
sleeves

TIME CUT ANOTHER DAY

Linguini and Colette shell peas Colette’s manner is easier
more collegial

COLETTE
I know the Gusteau style cold In
every dish Chef Gusteau always has
something unexpected I will show
you I memorized all his recipes--

LINGUINI
(writing it down)
“Always do something unexpected”

COLETTE
No “Follow the recipe”

LINGUINI
But you just said--

COLETTE
It was his job to be unexpected It
is our job to--

COLETTE and LINGUINI
--follow the recipe
TIME CUT ANOTHER DAY

Colette pulls a loaf from a basket of freshly baked bread and
shows it to Linguini

COLETTE
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it Not the smell
not the look but the sound of
the crust Listen--

She holds the loaf to her ears Linguini leans in to listen

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE
Remy also LEANS IN to listen Colette gives the bread a
SQUEEZE The CRACKLE is seductive
RESUME SCENE
She and Linguini SMILE at the pleasing CRUNCH
COLETTE (CONTD)
-a symphony of crackles Only

TIME CUT ANOTHER DAY - EARLY MORNING

Colette and Linguini have begun their prep There is a new
relaxation between them

COLETTE
The only way to get the best
produce is to have first pick of
the day and there are only two
ways to get first pick grow it
yourself or bribe a grower

She gestures to the back door Outside a PRODUCE SELLER
conversing amicably with La Rousse sets down a crate of
gorgeous fruit and vegetables La Rousse slips him money

COLETTE
Voila The best restaurants get
first pick

TIME CUT

Linguini and Colette cook side by side their manner now as
easy and familiar as old friends

INSIDE SKINNER’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Skinner listens to the radio Suddenly he SITS UP--

HIS POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Remy scampers across the alley to the kitchen entrance behind
GUSTEAU’S and into the hands of a kneeling Linguini

SKINNER
The rat

RESUME SKINNER
He JAMS the brakes throws the car into reverse As Linguini
is brought back into view we see that REMY IS GONE Still
kneeling Linguini holds up a set of KEYS
LINGUINI
(to Skinner chuckles)
I just dropped my keys

Skinner is BAFFLED

GUSTEAU’S - DINING AREA - NIGHT

There is noticeably more energy and fewer empty tables in the
dining room Mustafa arrives at a table of FOOD SNOBS

MUSTAFA

FOOD SNOB 1
Well the new soup is excellent but-

FOOD SNOB 2
--but we order it every time

MUSTAFA

FOOD SNOB 1
(impatient)
Yes the old standby you used to
be famous for it What does the
Chef have that’s new

stands there slack-jawed and blinking

crashes through the swinging doors in a panic

SKINNER MUSTAFA

SKINNER
This is simple Just pull out an
old Gusteau recipe something we
haven’t made in a while and--

MUSTAFA
They know about the old stuff They
like Linguini’s soup--

SKINNER
Linguini They are asking for food
from-- LINGUINI

LALO
A lot of customers like the soup
That’s all we were saying

POMPIDOU
Were we saying that

What should I tell them

I TOLD THEM I WOULD ASK

An IDEA comes to Skinner Dark pleasure blooms on his face

SKINNER
Very well If it’s Linguini they
want

He pulls Horst close and speaks to him quietly

SKINNER
tell them “Chef” Linguini has
prepared something special for
them something definitely “off-
menu” Oh and don’t forget to
stress its “Linguini-ness”

HORST
Oui Chef

Skinner turns to Linguini a big shark-smile on his face

SKINNER
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent Linguini A
forgotten favorite of the Chef’s
“Sweetbread a la Gusteau” Colette
will help you

COLETTE
Oui Chef
SKINNER
Now hurry up Our diners are

hungry

Skinner turns to go to his office a worried La Rousse rushes
up to him speaking in a low concerned voice

LA ROUSSE
Are you sure That recipe was a
disaster Gusteau himself said so

SKINNER
Just the sort of challenge a
budding chef needs

Skinner disappears inside his office humming to himself

WITH COLETTE and LINGUINI

Linguini looking over Colette’s shoulder as she stares at an
old yellowing recipe card sizing up it’s ingredients

COLETTE
Sweetbread a la Gusteau Sweetbread
cooked in a salt crust with
cuttlefish tenticles Drizzled
withsnail porridge

(with increasing distaste)
Douglas fir puree beetroot
mousse and pollendried white
fungus and dipped in anchovy
liquorice sauce Huh

Sounds awful Colette shrugs it off and turns to Linguini

COLETTE
I don’t know this recipe But it is
Gusteau So--
(calling out)
Lalo We have some veal stomach
soaking yes

LALO (0S)
Yes the veal stomach I get that

LINGUINI
Uh-- veal stomach

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE - MINUTES LATER

Remy pilots Linguini’s hand to lift the small pot of snail
porridge off the burner and up to Linguini’s toque for an
obligatory sniff Remy looks at the porridge then at the
rack of fresh spices Suddenly Remy pilots Linguini to go for
the SPICES lifting them rapidly one by one up the toque to
SNIFF Remy selects one that smells right and dumps it in the
pot

LINGUINI

suddenly LEANS FORWARD tilting his toque over the fragrant
STEAM from the simmering pot

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy takes a WHIFF likes what he smells Inspired he pilots
Linguini out into the kitchen

LINGUINI

--is alarmed by his sudden ramble completely unsure of where
he’s going what he’s looking for

UNDER THE TOQUE

Remy maneuvers Linguini spasmodically past the other cooks
stations wildly sniffing around for the next ingredient a
composer hunting for the next note in a new symphony He
catches a pleasing scent in Lalo’s station--

LINGUINI

SNATCHES some SHALLOTS from Lalo who looks up in SHOCK but
Linguini is already gone racing back to his station to add
the new ingredients to a heating pan

Linguini JERKS forward tilting his toque over the pan then
PEELS OUT of his station once again on the move

KITCHEN -SAME TIME

Linguini ZIPS about snatching ingredients from the other
cooks stations a Porche apologizing for its driver

LINGUINI
(ad-lib to cooks)
Pardon me just need to borrow this
real quick-- sorry-- apparently I
need this-- Ill be right back--

To the others Linguini looks deranged a man who’s clearly
lost control of both his body and his faculties

Linguini careens back into his station and DUMPS the
ingredients into his pan startling Colette--

COLETTE
What are you doing We are supposed
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe

LINGUINI
(stirring flipping pan)
I’m uh this is the recipe--

COLETTE
The recipe doesn’t call for white
truffle oil What else have you--
(MORE)

COLETTE (contd)
(she looks in his pan)
You are improvising This is no
time to experiment the customers
are waiting

LINGUINI
You’re right--
(to REMY nudging toque)
--I should listen to you

Linguini suddenly SLAPS his own face then LEANS his toque
over the Sweetbread

COLETTE LINGUINI
Stop that-- Stop what
COLETTE HORST
Freaking me out Whatever Where is the special order

youre doing-- stop it

Both Colette and Linguini are working quickly now but on
separate dishes giving the appearance of a competition

COLETTE LINGUINI
Coming We are together
(Low to Linguini)
I thought we were together on
this

COLETTE LINGUINI
Then what are you doing It’s--- VERY hard to explain

HORST
The special

COLETTE
Come get it

UNDER THE TOQUE
Remy watches anxiously as Colette sets the plate at the pass
to be picked up a hank of hair in each paw waiting for an

opening Colette glances at the recipe

COLETTE
Oh-- I forgot to add the liquorice

She rushes back to get it Remy sees his chance Linguini
finds himself grabbing his pan and hurtling toward Colette

AT THE PASS

Colette is about to add the liquorice sauce when Linguini
swoops in and BLOCKS HER HAND Colette is STUNNED Her eyes
FLASH at Linguini who looks petrified his left hand holds
his pan of saute which trembles over the Sweetbread

COLETTE
Don’t you dare

LINGUINI
I’m not I’m not I’m--

Linguini dumps his saute over Colette’s dish the moment
before it is swept away by the waiter Mustafa

LINGUINI (CONTD)
--sorry

Skinner enters smiling as he walks up to Horst

SKINNER
Is Linguini’s dish done yet

HORST
Ya It’s as bad as we remember
Just went out

SKINNER
(serene)
Did you taste it

HORST
Of course before he changed it

SKINNER
Good- WHAT How could he change it

HORST
He changed it as it was going out
the door

Skinner starts toward the door to the dining room just as
MUSTAFA busts through it excited

MUSTAFA
They love it Other diners are
already asking about it about
Linguini I have seven more orders

Colette is nonplussed Skinner FLINCHES then forces a smile

SKINNER
That’s wonderful

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy slaps his paws together relishing the night ahead

MONTAGE

Crosscut between the dining room and the kitchen orders pile
up as word of the “special” spreads between diners Remy
pilots Linguini preparing plate after plate of their hit

THE KITCHEN - LATER

The dinner rush is over The cooks congratulate their new
comrade Linguini toasting him glasses of table wine

Skinner watches from across the kitchen STARING at the boy
with a mixture of confusion envy and resentment As Linguini
pass in front of a light Skinner SEES IT a strange shadow
within Linguini’s toque--

--the SILHOUETTE OF A RAT Skinner’s EYES going WIDE

BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S

After a quick look around to make sure no one’s watching
Linguini removes his toque and lets Remy out

LINGUINI
Take a break little Chef get some
air We really did it tonight

Linguini unfolds a napkin revealing a miniature picnic
fruit bread cheeses Remy-- pooped but exhilarated-- beams
at Linguini who raises his glass in a salute to the rat

Linguini smiles and turns back inside

KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

We follow Linguini as he crosses the kitchen humming happily
to himself PANNING INTO FRAME is SKINNER perched high atop
a tray rack waiting like a cat ready to pounce He SNATCHES
the toque from Linguini’s head--

--and gapes in confusion when he sees nothing on top of the
boy’s head He looks at Linguini and SMILES

SKINNER
(dangling the toque)
Got your toque

Skinner hops to the ground fluffing the toque with his hand
before handing it back to the mystified Linguini

SKINNER
Seriously now I’d love to have a
little talk with you Linguini
in my office

LINGUINI
Am I in trouble

SKINNER
Trouble Nooo a little wine a
friendly chat Just us cooks

Colette watches Skinner steer Linguini into his office

HORST
(to Colette re Linguini)
The Plongeur won’t be coming to you
for advice anymore eh Colette
(nods to Skinners office)
He’s gotten all he needs

He exits chuckling Colette slowly turns away stung

INSIDE SKINNER’S OFFICE

Skinner settles in behind the massive desk that was formerly
Gusteau’s Linguini sits uneasily at a chair facing him
still holding his little glass of wine

SKINNER
Toasting your success eh Linguini
Good for you

LINGUINI
I just took it to be polite they
were being so nice to me I don’t
really drink you know--

SKINNER
Of course you don’t I wouldn’t
either if I was drinking that--

Skinner plucks the glass from Linguini’s hand pours it into
a wastebasket and offers up a newly opened bottle of wine

SKINNER (CONTD)

-but you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions not to
appreciate this ‘61 Chateau Latour
And you M’sieur Linguini are no
idiot

(raising his glass)
Let us toast your non-idiocy A
votre sante

They clink and DRINK

OUTSIDE KITCHEN - BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S

Remy munches contentedly and stares at the starry sky loving
his bread his cheese his life He breaks the top off a
grape and-- holding the stem like a wine glass-- slowly sips
it into a raisin

Something STIRS behind the trash cans Remy FREEZES suddenly
alert Some kind of CREATURE is eating in the shadows Remy
grabs the cheese knife and timidly goes to investigate

The creature LOOKS UP its glowing eyes fix on Remy Remy
GULPS raises the knife The creature LEAPS into the light--

EMILE
REMY

REMY
Emile--

They rush to each other hugging and laughing

REMY EMILE
What are you doing here I I can’t believe it You’re
thought I’d never see you alive You made it We
guys again figured you didn’t survive
the rapids
REMY

And what are you eating

Emile stares at Remy chewing He looks down pondering the
unrecognizable wad in his hands for a long beat He FROWNS

EMILE
I don’t really know I think it was
some sort of wrapper once

REMY
What-- No

Remy grabs the wad and throws it away with a flourish
REMY
Youre in Paris now baby My town
No brother of mine eats rejecta-

menta in my town

Remy turns on his heel and marches back into the kitchen

KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Remy climbs to the pull handle on the FOOD SAFE DOOR and
hesitates there LAUGHTER emanates from inside of Skinner’s
office Remy leaps to the handle and with considerable effort
pushes it open UNLOCKING the massive door GUSTEAU appears

GUSTEAU SPRITE
Remy you are stealing You told
Linguini he could trust you

REMY
And he can It’s for my brother

GUSTEAU SPRITE
The boy could lose his job

REMY
Which means I would too It’s
under control okay
Remy shoves past the Gusteau spite and into the safe The
sprite VANISHES
INSIDE SKINNER’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
Linguini sits back in his chair looking a bit tipsy

SKINNER
More wine

LINGUINI
I shouldnt But okay

He offers his glass to Skinner who refills it generously

SKINNER
So where did you train Linguini

LINGUINI
(chuckles drinking)
Train Alright

SKINNER
Surely you don’t expect me to
believe this is your first time
cooking

LINGUINI
It’s not

SKINNER
I KNEW IT

LINGUINI

It’s my

(stops counts on fingers)
second third four-- fifth
time Monday was my first time

(Skinner wilts)
But I’ve taken out the garbage lots
of times before this that’s why I--

SKINNER
(cutting him off pouring)
Yes yes yes Have some more wine
Tell me about your interests Do
you like animals

LINGUINI
What-- Animals What kind

SKINNER
Oh the usual Dogs cats horses
guinea pigs
(pointed)
---rats

BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S - MINUTES LATER

Remy carries a small bundle of gourmet foodstuffs from the
kitchen only to find Emile again munching on garbage

REMY
I brought you something to-- AGH
No no NO Spit that out right now
(Emile does shamed)
I have GOT to teach you about food
Close your eyes

As Emile closes his eyes his SURROUNDINGS FADE TO BLACK
Remy delicately holds a hunk of cheese under Emile’s nose--

REMY
Now take a bite of thi--

Emile INHALES it Horrified Remy scolds him like a bad pet

REMY (CONTD)
-NO NO NO Don’t just hork it down

EMILE
Too late

Annoyed Remy hands him another piece of cheese Emile eats
it this time more carefully

REMY
Chew it slowly think only about
the taste See

A vague grayish BLOB half-forms above his head It MOVES to
undefined MUSIC as Emile struggles to experience the food

EMILE
Not really

REMY
Creamy salty sweet An oaky
nuttiness You detect that

Emile opens his eyes (surroundings reappear) looks at Remy

EMILE
Oh I’m detecting nuttiness

REMY
Close your eyes Now taste this
(gives him a strawberry)
Whole different thing right
Sweet crisp slight tang on the
finish

The BLOB reappears but this time with a hint of color

EMILE
Okay

REMY
Now try them together Uh-huh See

Emile eats both together and chews concentrating Slowly the
weak COLORS become bolder and more complimentary They begin
to dance and intermingle as a little MELODY takes shape

EMILE
Okay I think I’m getting a
little something there It might be
the nuttiness Could be the tang

REMY
That’s it Now imagine every great
taste in the world being combined
into infinite combinations tastes
that no one has tried yet
Discoveries to be made

EMILE
I think--- you lost me again

Emile opens his eyes The SHAPES and SOUND FADE AWAY Sensing
Remy’s disappointment Emile reassures him

EMILE
But that was interesting Most
interesting garbage I ever-- HEY
What are we doing Dad doesn’t know
youre alive We’ve gotta go to the
colony Everyone will be thrilled

REMY
Yeah but uh thing is I
kinda have to uh

Remy gestures vaguely at the kitchen Emile frowns
EMILE
What What do you “hafta” more than
family What’s more important

He glares furiously at Remy whose resolve starts to crumble

REMY
Well it wouldn’t hurt to visit

INSIDE SKINNER’S OFFICE - STILL LATER
A few EMPTY BOTTLES of wine litter Skinner’s desk Linguini
is BOMBED but Skinner’s increasingly desperate inquisition

is getting nowhere

SKINNER LINGUINI
Have you ever had a pet rat Nope

SKINNER LINGUINI
Did you work in a lab with Nope
rats

SKINNER LINGUINI
Perhaps you lived in squalor Nopety nopety new

at some point

SKINNER
I KNOW you know something about
RATS You know you do

LINGUINI
You know who know do whacka do
Ratta tatta- hey Why do they call
it that

SKINNER
What

LINGUINI

Ratatouille There’s a dish called
that it’s like a stew right Why
do they call it that If you’re
gonna name a food you should give
it a name that sounds delicious
Ratatouille doesn’t sound
delicious It sounds like rat And
patooty Rat patooty Which does
NOT sound delicious

Linguini drinks finds his glass empty He smiles offering
his glass for Skinner to refill

SKINNER
(scowling)
Regrettably--

He drops the empty bottle into the trash with a loud THUNK
SKINNER (CONTD)
--we are all out of wine
INSIDE SEWER - RAT COMMONS - A LITTLE LATER
Several channels converge into a wide open area as dreary
and uninviting as any sewer save for a flotilla of tiny
BOATS illuminated by a scattering of multi-colored lanterns

that answer the gloom with magic

Holding their clasped paws up victoriously Django turns from
Remy to face the assembled crowd of rats

DJANGO
MY SON HAS RETURNED

An enormous CHEER erupts Emile joins Django and Remy as the
clan crowds around them Remy’s joy is clouded with doubt
what about his new life

RAT ENCAMPMENT - LATER

A PARTY is in full swing The entire rat clan has come out to
bop to boisterous MUSIC played by a jazzy RAT BAND kicking
down the jams in a unique gypsyjitterbug dance style that
takes full advantage of their tails and all four legs

Joined by his sons Django sits at a prime table A WAITER
RAT quickly serves a round of drinks in well-worn thimbles
between them Emile and Django suck theirs down Remy takes a
discreet whiff and sets it aside

DJANGO
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a
disaster Nothing’s been poisoned
thank God but it hasn’t been easy
You didn’t make it easy

REMY
I know I am sorry Dad

DJANGO
Well the important thing is that
youre home

REMY
Yeah well uh about that

DJANGO
You look thin Why is that A
shortage of food or a surplus of
snobbery

Emile joins in as Django cracks up at his own joke

DJANGO
It’s tough out there in the big
world all alone isn’t it

REMY
Sure but it’s not like Ima
kid anymore

A well-wisher drops by to say hello to Django Remy takes
advantage of the distraction to quickly deliver the bad news

REMY
I can take care of myself I’ve
found a nice spot not far away so
Ill be able to visit often

DJANGO
(resuming conversation)
Nothing like a cold splash of
reality to make you--
(sudden realization)
--“visit

REMY
I will I promise Often

DJANGO
Youre not staying

REMY
It’s not a big deal Dad
(gently)
You didn’t think I was going to
stay forever did you Eventually a
bird’s gotta leave the nest

DJANGO
We’re not birds we’re rats We
don’t leave nests we make them
bigger

REMY
Maybe I’m different kind of rat

DJANGO
Maybe you’re not a rat at all

REMY
Maybe that’s a good thing

EMILE
(trying to break tension)
Hey the band’s really on tonight

REMY
Rats All we do is take Dad I’m
tired of taking I want to make
things I want to add something to
this world

DJANGO

You’re talking like a human
REMY

Who are not as bad as you say
DJANGO

Oh yeah
EMILE

Oh man
DJANGO

What makes you so sure
Remy hesitates for a beat suddenly careful

REMY
Ive uh been able to uh observe
them at a close-ish sort of range

DJANGO
Yeah How close

REMY
Close enough And they’re y’know
not so bad As you say They are

Django GLARES at Remy scrutinizing him

DJANGO
Come with me I got something I
want you to see

He moves from the table dropping to all fours and heading
off Reluctantly Remy does likewise leaving Emile alone

EMILE
You know I think I’1l stay here

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT - SAME TIME

The sound of raindrops patter against the skylight Skinner
bundled up in a well-tailored overcoat throws a scarf around
his neck Linguini tipsily hands him his beret

SKINNER
Make sure the floors and counter-
tops are clean before you lock up

LINGUINI
You want me to stay and clean

SKINNER
Is that a problem

Linguini slumps and drunkenly shakes his head “no”

SKINNER
Good boy See you tomorrow

Skinner exits humming Linguini watches him go with weary
eyes He turns to face the messy kitchen and wilts

PARIS STREET - NIGHT

It’s raining harder now Django and Remy arrive at a drain
opening through which can be glimpsed the rough cobblestones
of a city street

DJANGO
We’re here

Django scrambles out the curb-side drain and turns to face
the storefront behind them Remy sits next to him and looks
up following his father’s gaze His jaw drops in horror

Displayed in the window of the small shop are a variety of
nasty looking metal traps RAT TRAPS to be precise and along
side of those hang row after row of DEAD RATS

DJANGO
Take a good long look Remy This
is what happens when a rat gets a
little too comfortable around
humans

Remy looks away Django’s tone is tender but firm

DJANGO
The world we live in belongs to the
enemy We must live carefully We
look out for our own kind Remy
When all is said and done we’re
all weve got

His point made Django turns to go Remy stares up at the
horrible window then softly says--

REMY
No

DJANGO
(stops in his tracks)
What

REMY
No Dad I don’t believe it You’re
telling me that the future is-- can
ONLY be--
(points at window)
--more of this

DJANGO
This is the way things are You
can’t change nature

REMY
Change IS nature Dad The part
that we can influence And it
starts when we decide

With that Remy turns and-- walking upright on two legs--
starts back to Gusteau’s Django calls after him

DJANGO
Where you goin’

REMY

With luck forward
OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S - MORNING
The storm has passed and the sky is cloudless and clear As a
weary Remy exits the sewer the fresh air hits his nostrils
and he draws it in like a sweet memory
He exhales renewed and happy to be back in his brave new
world Forgetting himself he trots for the kitchen entrance
on two legs throwing a reckless wave at a passing CYCLIST
The cyclist DOUBLE-TAKES craning his neck to look at the
bizarre sight-- and collides with a parked car
KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT
Remy enters and looks around No one has arrived yet Remy
steps on to the counter top and surveys the kitchen savoring
the day ahead And then he hears the sound SNORING
He TAKES COVER and peers out No one is there but the
SNORING persists He peers cautiously over the edge--
REMY’S POV

--as Remy walks forward REVEALING

LINGUINI-- curled up on the floor and slumbering like a
vagrant Remy looks at the clock realizing with horror that
the others are about to arrive

Remy jumps onto Linguini’s head like a rough rider on a
fallen horse and-- expertly TUGGING hanks of Linguini’s hair
Manages to get the boy up on his feet

But Linguini remains FAST ASLEEP Remy lifts one of
Linguini’s heavy EYELIDS and waves frantically at a staring
eye-- but Linguini is OUT COLD

The SOUND of a motorcycle arriving at the rear entrance
causes Remy to looks around in desperation He spies a pair
of SUNGLASSES near the cook’s lockers

Colette ENTERS unpleasantly surprised to find LINGUINI
already at work She crosses to their station and starts
prep Remy has hidden Linguini’s shut eyes behind sunglasses
unintentionally giving him the air of a smug ROCK STAR

Though Linguini remains fast ASLEEP Remy pulls his hair to
keep the boy’s limbs working somewhat convincingly

COLETTE
(cool formal)
Good morning

INTERCUT UNDER LINGUINI’S TOQUE COLETTE and LINGUINI

Remy pulls hair nervously puppeting the sleeping Linguini
How can he make Linguini answer He PULLS a side hair hank--

--causing Linguini’s head to loll to Colette give her a lazy
nod then turn back to his work

COLETTE
So The Chef He invited you in for
a drink That’s big that’s big
What did he say
UNDER LINGUINI’S TOQUE
Remy hesitates There’s no hair he can pull for speech
Desperate he pulls the head-turn hair again

RESUME SCENE

Linguini’s head lolls lazily back to Colette the effect
being a smug “What do you think he said babe”

COLETTE
What-- you can’t tell me

Linguini is silent He resumes cutting Colette goes cold

COLETTE
Oh Forgive me for intruding on
your deep personal relationship
with the Chef I see how it is You
get me to teach you a few kitchen
tricks to dazzle the boss and then
you blow past me

UNDER LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Things are going bad fast Remy keeps Linguini chopping
hoping desperately for an idea to salvage the situation

REMY
Ca’mon Wake up wake up--

RESUME SCENE

Linguini keeps chopping vegetables like a hip zombie His
smirking face rolls in Colette’s direction

COLETTE
(small hurt)
I thought you were different I
thought you thought I was
different I thought--

Now seemingly looking straight at her Linguini SNORES

Colette GASPS and delivers a roundhouse SLAP to Linguini’s
face Linguini CORKSCREWS and CRASHES to the floor

Linguini-- now completely awake and utterly confused at the
crucial chunk of his life he’s somehow missed-- looks up at
the furious Colette with wide eyes

COLETTE
I didn’t have to help you If I
looked out only for myself I could
have let you drown But--
(this is hard for her)
--I wanted you to succeed I liked
you My mistake

Colette turns storming out the kitchen’s back door Both
Linguini and Remy- who peers out of Linguini’s fallen toque
watch he go Linguini turns to Remy

LINGUINI
It’s over Little Chef I can’t do
it any more

He grabs the toque with Remy inside and runs after Colette

OUTSIDE GUSTEAU’S - ALLEY BEHIND KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Colette is already on her motorcycle Linguini runs to her

LINGUINI
Stop-- Don’t motorcycle away--
(She atops looks at him)
Look I’m no good with words I’m
no good with food either At least
not without your help

COLETTE
I hate false modesty It’s just
another way to lie You have talent-

LINGUINI
But I don’t Really It’s not me

UNDER LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy eyes widen this can’t be happening

RESUME LINGUINI and COLETTE

LINGUINI (CONTD)
And when I added those extra
ingredients instead of following
the recipe like you said-- that
wasn’t me either

COLETTE
What do you mean

LINGUINI
I mean I wouldn’t have done that I
would’ve followed the recipe I
would’ve followed your advice I
wouldve followed your advice to
the ends of the earth because I
love-- your advice
COLETTE
But

LINGUINI
But I have a secret
UNDER LINGUINI’S TOQUE
Remy’s really getting worried now
REMY
(softly)
Don’t do it
RESUME SCENE
Colette’s eyes narrow She’s not liking the sound of

LINGUINI
It’s sort of disturbing

Linguini chuckles sheepishly then straightens as if
an announcement taking a deep breath

LINGUINI
I have a rr aah--uht
COLETTE
What
LINGUINI
I have a rahh tsh-
COLETTE
You have a rash
LINGUINI
NO No I have this tiny a

(quickly blurts it out)
-tiny chef who tells me what to do

COLETTE
A tiny chef

LINGUINI
Yes yes he’s uh uhhhmmn
(points to toque)
--he’s up here--

this

to make

COLETTE
In your brain

LINGUINI
Why is it so hard to talk to you
(gathering courage)
Okay Here we go You-- inspire me
I’m going to risk it all I’m going
to risk looking like the biggest
idiot psycho you’ve ever seen

Colette is starting to get scared We follow her HAND as it
drops discreetly into her BAG and emerges clutching a tiny
cannister of PEPPER SPRAY Linguini continues impassioned

LINGUINI (CONTD)
You wanna know why I’m such a fast
learner Why I’m such a great cook
Don’t laugh I’m going to show you--

Colette looks WORRIED With great resolve and trembling
hands Linguini slowly reaches up to remove his toque--

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Through the cloth Remy watches LINGUINI’S HANDS CLOSING IN--
about to expose him and ruin it all He YANKS on Linguini’s
hair thrusting Linguini forward toward Colette’s face--

ON LINGUINI

--as he plants a big KISS on Colette’s lips Colette is
frozen pepper spray in hand her shock and surprise
surpassed only by Linguini’s own

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

With furrowed brows and gritted teeth Remy maintains
Linguini’s forward thrust kiss This could go either way
INTERCUT LINGUINI and COLETTE

--as they continue their startled kiss their eyes flash
through a myriad of emotions surprise fear anger

vulnerability happiness and finally-- surrender Their arms
wrap around each other

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy COLLAPSES with relief For the moment anyway the
fragile charade survives

INSIDE EGO’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

A very tall very narrow room simultaneously grand and
claustrophobic Its soaring windows are framed by heavy
velvet drapes pulled nearly shut allowing in only a thin
sliver of pale light

The few pieces of antique furniture in the room are equally
tall narrow straight-backed and uncomfortable looking

The faded burgundy walls are decorated with framed
photographs and magazine covers precisely arranged around a
massive PORTRAIT PAINTING Their single subject a tall
cadaverous man dressed in an expensive suit ANTON EGO--

--the same Anton Ego who now sits at a desk that is the rooms
focal point looming over an ancient typewriter like a
vulture with better posture

The rooms lone door opens and a short pudgy man in his mid-
thirties enters This is Ego’s assistant AMBRISTER MINION

EGO
What is it Ambrister
MINION
Gusteau’s
EGO
Finally closing is it
MINION
No
EGO
More financial trouble
MINION
No it’s--
EGO

(losing patience)
--announced a new line of microwave
eggroles what Spit it out

MINION
--it’s come back It’s
(bewildered)
popular

Ego looks up eyes flashing

EGO
I haven’t reviewed Gusteau’s in
years

MINION
No Sir

Ego pulls open his files deftly riffling through folders

EGO
My last review condemned it to the
tourist trade

MINION
Yes Sir

Ego locates the review and plucks it from the files reading
it aloud as if it were divinely inspired

EGO
I said--
(reading)
“Gusteau has finally found his
rightful place in history right
alongside another equally famous
Chef-- Monsieur ‘Boyardee’”

MINION
Touche’

Rising from his desk Ego moves menacingly toward Minion
EGO
That is where I left it That was
my last word THE last word

MINION
Yes

EGO
Then tell me Ambrister

Ego now LOOMS over the cowering Minion

EGO (CONTD)
how could it be “popular”

SKINNER’S OFFICE - DAY

Skinner is seated at his desk his head in his hands Talon
sits in a chair across from him sipping an espresso

SKINNER
No no no NO NO NOOO

TALON
(matter of fact)
The DNA matches the timing works
everything checks out He is
Gusteau’s son

SKINNER
This can’t just-- happen The whole
thing is a set-up The boy knows

Skinner goes to his window parts the blinds to the kitchen

SKINNER
Look at him out there pretending
to be an idiot He’s toying with my
mind like a cat with a ball Of
something

TALON
String

SKINNER
Yes Playing dumb Taunting me with
that rat

TALON
Rat

SKINNER
Yes He’s consorting with it
Deliberately trying to make me
think it’s important

TALON
The rat

SKINNER
Exactly

The lawyer is watching Skinner now eyes wide with worry
TALON

(delicately)
Is the rat “important”

SKINNER
Of course not He just wants me to
think that it is Oh I see the
theatricality of it a rat appears
on the boy’s first night I order
him to kill it and now he wants me
to see it everywhere-- wooo00000--
(snaps fingers wildly)

-it’s here no it isn’t it’s HERE
Am I seeing things am I crazy is
there a phantom rat or is there
not But ohhh no I refuse to be
sucked into his little game of--

Skinner is suddenly aware that Talon is staring at him
TALON
Should I be concerned about this
(pointedly)
About you
KITCHEN
LinguiniRemy are cooking As Colette walks by Linguini’s
eyes then head start to follow her--
INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE
Remy wonders why Linguini’s head has drifted away from the
task at hand He looks up sees Colette Rolling his eyes at
Linguini’s limited concentration he pulls Linguini’s hair--
RESUME SCENE
Linguini’s head jerks face forward He frowns annoyed at
Remy’s correction Colette is cooking at the oven behind him
now And Linguini’s eyes have drifted back to her
-following the curves of her legs slowly up to her FACE
She turns catching him-- and SMILES He smiles back

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

With waning patience Remy again JERKS Remy back on task

SKINNER’S OFFICE —- SAME TIME

Skinner PACES back and forth in front of Talon

SKINNER
I can’t fire him He’s getting
attention If I fire him now
everyone will wonder why and the
last thing I want is people looking
into this

TALON
What are you so worried about
Isn’t it good to have the press
Isn’t it good to have Gusteau’s
name getting headlines

SKINNER
(points at Linguini photo)
Not if they’re over HIS face
Gusteau’s already has a face and
it’s fat and lovable and familiar
And it sells burritos Millions and
millions of burritos

TALON
The deadline passes in three days
then you can fire him whenever he
ceases to be a valuable You’re
still in charge and no one will
ever know

Talon prepares to leave hesitates at the door--
TALON
You know I was worried about the
hair sample you gave me I had to
send it back to the lab

SKINNER
Why

TALON
Because the first time it came back
identified as “rodent hair”

Talon shrugs chuckles and EXITS Skinner stares HAUNTED

KITCHEN

Under Remy’s direction Linguini reaches for a spice Colette
interrupts handing him another one

COLETTE
No no Try this It’s better

UNDER THE TOQUE

Remy looks at the offered spice and scowls he begs to
differ As Linguini reaches to take the spice Remy pulls
back on his hair--

INTERCUT LINGUINI and COLETTE WITH REMY

Linguini FLINCHES his hand HESITATING withdrawing then
reaching-- forward-back-forward-back

Colette watches this odd display still holding the spice
out Linguini grabs the wrist of his reaching hand forcing
it toward the spices as--

--REMY TUGS at Linguini’s hair directing him just as hard in
the opposite direction It’s a battle for control--

--that Linguini WINS his hand finally grabs he spice tin He
smiles at Colette

Underneath the toque Remy GRIMACES

ALLEYWAY BEHIND KITCHEN - LATER

The dinner rush finished Linguini and Colette exit the
kitchen laughing and holding hands She pulls him aboard her
motorcycle and they peel out into the young Paris night

PARIS STREETS - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Linguini and Colette laugh and scream as the wind rips by
Linguini barely able to hang on to his toque and we realize--

--REMY IS STILL INSIDE HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE As Colette
takes a sharp turn Linguini drops his arms to steady himself-

--and his TOQUE (WITH REMY INSIDE) FLIES OFF HIS HEAD and
tumbles to the street Dazed Remy emerges from the battered
toque to see Colette’s cycle disappear over the horizon

Car horns BLARE Remy turns to see a massive WALL OF TRAFFIC
barreling toward him He dives clear as CARS roar past
wheels screech and lights flash in all directions as he madly
scrambles out of their way finally making it to the curb

Remy looks up as a young woman recoils jumping back into her
sweethearts arms

WOMAN
A RAT

Her escort swats at Remy with his coat Remy runs jumping
into a nearby STORM DRAIN

INSIDE THE STORM DRAIN

Remy tumbles to the cement floor his heart pounding Through
the grate he sees the legs of the WOMAN and her ESCORT

WOMAN (0S)
Disgusting little creatures

Remy listens pained He spies his reflection in a pool of
water at this feet He turns slowly disappearing into the
sewer’s darkness

REMY (VO)
I was reminded how fragile it all
was How the world really saw me
And it just kept getting better

OUTSIDE BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S - DAWN

Remy emerges from the curb drain turns into the alley behind
GUSTEAU’S and heads up the back steps

EMILE (0S)
Psst Remy

Remy turns EMILE peeks out from behind the trash cans where
he waits with a GROUP OF RATS including GIT the lab rat

EMILE
Hey little brother We were afraid
you weren’t gonna show up

GIT OTHER RATS
Hey Remy Howya doin’ (assorted greetings)

Remy takes Emile aside speaking in an angry whisper
REMY

You told them Emile that’s
exactly what I said not to do

EMILE
But they’re my friends I didn’t
think you meant-- I was telling ‘em
about tasting about the nutty tang
and look I’m sorry I’m sorry-

REMY
Don’t tell me you’re sorry tell
them you’re sorry-

GIT has approached

GIT
There a problem over here

REMY
No
(SCOWLS at Emile)
No there is not Wait here

KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Assured the kitchen is empty Remy hops to door handle of the
food safe and grabs it with both arms plants his feet on the
door and pulls The handle doesn’t budge the door is LOCKED
Remy is puzzled He looks toward SKINNER’S OFFICE

SKINNER’S OFFICE

Remy enters a little nervous and scampers up to Skinner’s
desk A framed black and white PHOTO of Gusteau speaks

GUSTEAU PHOTO

REMY
Emile shows up-- I said not to but
he goes and blabs- it’s a disaster
Anyway they’re hungry the food

GUSTEAU PHOTO

Remy climbs over the edge of Skinner’s desk pushes open the
drawer and begins to rummage through its contents

REMY (CONTD)
Word’s getting out and if I can’t
keep them quietthe entire clan’s
going to be after me with their
mouths open and-
(he finds the key)
--ah Here it is Hey

Remy notices a FILE labeled “Gusteau Last Will and Testament”
He turns to the Gusteau portrait

REMY
-your will--

GUSTEAU PHOTO
This used to be my office

Remy pulls the file from the drawer and lays it on the desk

REMY
This is interesting Mind if I--

GUSTEAU PHOTO
Not at all

Remy flips open the file There alongside Gusteau’s will
are recent press clippings featuring LINGUINI and the letter
to Skinner from Linguini’s mother

REMY
“Linguini” Why would Linguini be
filed with your will

MUSIC BUILDS as Remy reads his eyes jumping between the
LETTER and the WILL his eyes getting BIGGER until--

REMY

HE’S YOUR SON
GUSTEAU

I have a SON
REMY

YES How could you not know this
GUSTEAU

(defensive)

I am a figment of your imagination
You did not know How could I

REMY
Well YOUR SON is the rightful
owner of this restaurant

SKINNER OPENS the office door and FREEZES-- stunned by the
bizarre sight of a RAT on his desk top Remy SNATCHES the
DOCUMANTS in his mouth and RUNS

OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Remy races out into the street Hot on his heels Skinner
runs smack into LALO on a moped Before the mortified Lalo
can apologize Skinner is back on his feet

SKINNER
No NO-- The rat It’s stolen my
documents It’s getting away

With an crazed shriek Skinner pushes Lalo off the scooter
jumps on and roars off down the street

PARIS STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Skinner screeches to a stop at the INTERSECTION looks around

wildly for Remy He sights the DOCUMENTS scampering through
traffic and guns the motor recklessly giving chase

NEAR THE SEINE - MOVING WITH SKINNER

Closing in on Remy Skinner reaches down to snatch the
documents when the rat suddenly VEERS Skinner’s Moped
plunges down a flight of steps to the river where it lays in
a heap at the bottom Skinner looks up sees--

REMY-- looking down at him from the balustrade documents
still clutched in his mouth Remy LAUGHS A gust froma
passing BUS sweeps the WILL from Remy’s open jaws and high
into the air where it flutters out over the river’s edge

MOVING ALONG THE BANKS - CONTINUOUS

SKINNER sees his chance He clambers aboard the Moped and
takes off after the will dodging obstacles and passers-by to
pursue from the banks below Remy chases it from the
balustrade above the letter still in his mouth

THE WILL begins to descend flitting toward Skinner below
who reaches for it his fingers spreading wide--

Remy makes two desperate LEAPS from the balustrade to a
tree from the tree into the air just above Skinner where he--

INTERCEPTS the will-- sailing toward the water and landing
with a FWOP on the canvas roof of a Bateux Mouche Remy can’t
believe he’s got both documents again

Neither can Skinner He ditches the Moped and LEAPS to the
deck of the Seine boat

ON THE SEINE - MOVING BETWEEN THE BOATS

Remy documents in mouth leaps to another passing boat
Skinner still hot on his tail

A jam of water traffic keeps this game alive the two leaping
from boat to boat but the last leap to a DINING BOAT- is
too far Remy tries anyway launching into the air the
documents in his mouth sweep back like WINGS and he--

--catches an updraft He SAILS across the gulf landing
miraculously on the deck

Skinner crazily follows making the leap of his life as he
stretches out for the dining boats’ railing and--

--falls short grasping instead the tablecloth of a couple
dining near the railing which he yanks out from under their
breakfast like an inept magician as he--

--plunges into the river Skinner sputters in the middle of
the Seine as Remy hops up to a bridge passing overhead
scampering safely away with Skinner’s papers

GUSTEAU’S - SKINNER’S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER

Skinner returns to his office soaked and furious only to
find LINGUINI sitting at his desk

SKINNER
You Get out of my office

looks at Linguini who can only shrug with embarrassment

Gusteau’s (looking for the rat in the kitchen) and stewing
(over the loss of his little empire and the glowing press
coverage of Linguini)

(C) Linguini and Colette raise the blinds in Skinner’s old
office opening it to light and a clear view of the Kitchen

In the alley behind the kitchen the COOKS symbolically burn
the GUSTEAU STANDEES created to promote Skinner’s hated
FROZEN FOOD line All cheer as the FLAMES rise higher

DINING AREA —- GUSTEAU’S - EARLY EVENING - DAYS LATER

FLASHES POP Linguini sits at a table posing for photos
Several JOURNALISTS hover nearby shouting questions

REPORTER 1
Chef Linguini Chef Linguini
Your rise has been meteoric and
yet you have no formal training
What is the secret to your genius

INSIDE LINGUINI’S TOQUE

Remy reacts to the question looking down at the head beneath
him as if to say Yeah smart guy what is your secret”

RESUME SCENE

LINGUINI
I’m Auguste Gusteau’s son It’s in
my blood I guess

REPORTER 3
But you weren’t aware of that fact
until very recently--

LINGUINI
No

REPORTER 3
--and it resulted in your taking
ownership of this restaurant How
did you find out

ON REMY His face says “Because I risked my neck”

WITH LINGUINI

LINGUINI
Some part of me just knew
(lamely trying it out)
-the Gusteau part

UNDER THE TOQUE

Remy tugs a hair tuft causing Linguini to bop himself in the
head with his frying pan

REPORTER 1
Where do you get your inspiration

LINGUINI
Inspiration

Again Remy pricks up his ears
LINGUINI
Inspiration has many names Mine is

named Colette

REMY

WITH LINGUINI

An outraged SQUEAK erupts from inside Linguini’s toque
Linguini quickly muffles Remy’s squeaks with both hands as he
sets his toque down on the table Linguini sucks on his
teeth making a squeaking sound

LINGUINI (CONTD)
Something stuck in my teeth

NADAR LESSARD a bored bureaucrat He turns from a pile of

paperwork and answers

LESSARD

PHONE BOOTH - ACROSS FROM GUSTEAU’S - SAME TIME

Anxious unshaven and wrapped in a trench coat that makes
him look vaguely like a pervert Skinner speaks into a pay

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT
Horst looks at the clock scowls and turns to Colette

HORST
It’s past opening time

COLETTE
He should’ve finished an hour ago

She heaves an annoyed sigh and heads out to the dining area

DINING AREA

Colette enters the swirl of activity to confront Linguini He
shoots her a cocky smile offering her a glass of champagne

LINGUINI
Bon jour Mon Cherie Join us We
were talking about my inspiration-

COLETTE
(to journalists)
Yes he calls it his “tiny Chef”

Linguini muffles another SQUEAK of protest from under his
toque He shoots Colette a reprimanding look leans in and
says in a low tight voice-

LINGUINI
Not that dearest I meant you

Just then the front door swings open spilling cold light and
air into the warmth of the restaurant The press swings its
attention to the tall backlit spectre at the entrance
whispering his legendary name “Ego” He glides through them
without acknowledging their presence and stops in front of
Linguini who is still seated

EGO
You are Monsieur Linguini

LINGUINI
Uh hello

EGO
Pardon me for interrupting your
premature celebration But I
thought it only fair to give you a
sporting chance as you are new to
this game

UNDER THE TOQUE
Remy watches with fear and awe

LINGUINI
Uh game

EGO
Yes And you’ve been playing with-
out an opponent Which is as you
may have guessed against the
rules

RESUME SCENE

LINGUINI
Youre Anton Ego

Ego chuckles turning to the gallery a lion almost
sympathetic toward the sacrificial lamb

EGO
You’re slow for someone in the fast
lane

LINGUINI
And youre thin for someone who
likes food

The lamb bites back A murmur of surprised delight ripples
through the assembled Ego’s eyes FLASH

EGO
I don’t “like” food I love it If
I don’t love it I don’t-- swallow

Linguini SWALLOWS Upper hand regained Ego sniffs--

EGO (CONTD)
I will return tomorrow night with
high expectations Pray you don’t
disappoint me

Ego turns and sweeps out of the restaurant There is a heavy
PAUSE Colette turns to the assembled press

COLETTE
Listen we hate to be rude but
were French And it’s dinner time

She pulls Linguini from the table and heads to the kitchen
He calls back to the press in apology--

LINGUINI
She meant to say “it’s dinner time
and were French”--

HEAD CHEF’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Remy stands on the desk top glowering at Linguini

LINGUINI
Don’t give me that look You were
distracting me in front of the
press How am I supposed to
concentrate with you yanking my
hair all the time

Linguini sticks out his hand offering Remy a now familiar
ramp to his post atop Linguini’s head Remy shoots Linguini
an “about time” look climbs up his arm and under his toque

LINGUINI
And that’s another thing Your
opinion isn’t the only one that
matters here Colette knows how to
cook too you know--

UNDER THE TOQUE
The last straw Remy grabs a hair hank and pulls-- too hard
LINGUINI (CONTD)
--- OW Alright that’s it
OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - DUSK
The door bangs open Linguini storms out mashing his toque
against his head angrily shuts the door behind him He yanks
his toque off and gets in Remy’s tiny face--
LINGUINI
You take a break little chef I’m
not your puppet and you’re not my--
uh puppet controlling guy
FROM THE ROOF ABOVE

SKINNER watches this strange scene his jaw hanging open

SKINNER
The rat is the cook

LINGUINI
You cool off and get your mind
right little chef Ego is coming
and I’ve gotta focus

Skinner watches as Linguini storms back into the kitchen He
EXITS ducking down the fire escape

RESUME REMY

He’s FURIOUS In a pint-sized fit of rage he kicks a can
then tottering under its weight picks up a bottle to throw
against the wall and suddenly finds himself face to face with-

--EMILE and his RAT PALS

EMILE
Wow I’ve never seen that before

GIT
Yeah it’s like you’re his fluffy
bunny or something

The other rats laugh Remy’s face goes hard
EMILE

I’m sorry about all the guys Remy
I tried to limit them but--

REMY
You know what It’s okay
(To group)

I’ve been selfish You guys hungry
(RATS respond eagerly)
Dinner’s on me We’1l go after
closing time In fact--
(to Emile evil grin)
--tell Dad to bring the whole clan

LINGUINI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Linguini returns calling out in the darkened apartment

LINGUINI
Little chef

He looks in Remy’s little sleeping area finding it EMPTY

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S - NIGHT

Horst puts the kitchen to bed He pulls on his coat and turns
the LIGHTS OUT Beat A metal GRATE in the floor lifts up
Remy and Django peek out

DJANGO
This is great son An inside job
(too loudly)
I see the appeal--

REMY
Shhh

Remy climbs out looks around signals the coast is clear An
army of RATS- a crack FOOD THEFT UNIT- pour in after him
mobilizing effectively to raid the vault as he opens the
door when all of a sudden--

--LINGUINI RETURNS to the kitchen

LINGUINI
Little Chef Little Chef

The CLAN RATS instantly freeze camouflaging themselves It
is both amazing and precarious any close look will betray
the deception Remy steps out revealing himself to Linguini

LINGUINI
Hey Little Chef I thought you
went back to the apartment Then
when you weren’t there I don’t
know it didn’t seem right--

As Linguini opens up to Remy we cut to QUICK SHOTS visual
gags of the rat clan hiding in plain sight desperate to
avoid discovery Remy listens distracted

LINGUINI (CONTD)
--to leave things the way we did so
I came back hoping you’d be here
And here you are

Linguini is so absorbed in his own feelings that he’s utterly
blind to the fact that the food safe door is ajar and that
hes caught the rats MID-HEIST

LINGUINI (CONTD)
Look I don’t want to fight I’ve
been under a lot of- you know
pressure A lot has changed in not
very much time you know I’m
suddenly a Gusteau and I gotta be a
Gusteau or you know people will be
disappointed It’s weird

INSIDE THE FOOD SAFE MORE QUICK SHOTS
RATS HIDE up on the shelves in EGG CARTONS inside the

holes in a wedge of SWISS CHEESE submerged in an open sack
of COFFEE BEANS leaving only their tiny NOSES visible

EMILE hides in the center of an ASPARAGUS BUNCH held together
by a rubber band His eyes latch on to a juicy BUNCH OF
GRAPES which hang literally in front of his face

Enticed he leans forward just enough to get his lips around
the end of a single grape and s-l-o-w-l-y SUCKS IT OFF THE
STEM into his mouth swallowing it whole Mmmnn

He glances up another grape beckons Emile leans for it--

LINGUINI (CONTD)
-I’ve never disappointed anyone
before because nobody’s ever
expected anything of me And the
only reason anyone expects anything
from me now is because of you

REMY listens to Linguini shamed by his kind words

LINGUINI
I haven’t been fair to you You’ve
never failed me and I should never
forget that

INSIDE THE FOOD SAFE

Emile now stuffed and lumpy with grapes eyes the last
REMAINING GRAPE on the stem Balancing on a CHEESE WHEEL he
lashes the asparagus rubber band to the shelf and leans out
over the edge straining to reach the lone grape

LINGUINI (CONTD)
The most honorable friend a guy
could ever ask--

The cheese wheel SHIFTS Emile loses his balance and falls
hits the floor spread-eagled The CHEESE lands on top of him
causing his bellyful of GRAPES to machine gun from his mouth--

--and hit the back of Linguini’s neck He TURNS-- sees that
the food safe door is OPEN

Linguini (CONTD)
What is this What’s going on--

He pulls open the door and flips the light on The RATS FLEE--
spilling from the shelves in a squeaking fur covered WAVE
that rushes past Linguini’s feet and out the open door

LINGUINI
(to Remy betrayed)
Youre stealing from me
(MORE)

LINGUINI (contd)
How could you I thought you were
my friend I trusted you

OUTSIDE KITCHEN - REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

The door bursts open and a flood of rats pour out the rear
door into the alley Linguini behind them brandishing a mop

LINGUINI (CONTD)
Get out You and all your rat
buddies And don’t come back Or
I’1ll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests

Linguini ducks back inside SLAMMING the door behind him
Remy stares in silence devastated by what he’s done DJANGO
and the rest of the RAT CLAN emerges from the shadows
gathering around the group including Remy and Emile

REMY
You’re right Dad Who am I
kidding We are what we are And
we’re rats

Remy turns unconsciously drops to four legs and walks slowly
away his voice distant and sad

REMY
Well he’ll leave soon and now
you know how to get in Steal all
you want

DJANGO
You’re not coming

REMY
I’ve lost my appetite

DINING ROOM - GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Strangely Linguini is dressed as a WAITER He waits on a
lone DINER whose face is hidden behind a menu

LINGUINI
Do you know what you’d like sir

The MENU lowers revealing EGO He GRINS ravenous
EGO

Yes I’d like your heart roasted
on a spit--

Linguini is frozen in fear his heart pounding as Ego’s cold
chuckle turns into a ROAR--

INSIDE HEAD CHEF’S OFFICE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
Linguini AWAKENS Someone is POUNDING is at his office door

LINGUINI
C--come COME IN

The door opens and Colette leans in speaking tenderly--

COLETTE
Today is a big day You should say
something to them

LINGUINI
Like what

COLETTE
You are the boss Inspire them

KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Linguini places a step ladder at the front of the kitchen and
stands on the top step He clears his throat

LINGUINI
Attention Attention everyone

The staff pauses and turns their attentions to Linguini

LINGUINI

Tonight is a big night Appetite is
coming and he’s going to have a big
Ego

(stops corrects himself)
I mean Ego He’s coming The
critic And he’s going to order
Something Something from our menu
And well have to cook it Unless
he orders something cold Like a
salad

The COOKS exchange confused glances Colette wilts This is
not the inspiration she had in mind
OUTSIDE REAR KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S - SAME MOMENT

Remy is watching this through the kitchen window He sighs

EMILE
Just can’t leave it alone can ya’

Emile is by the trash Remy HOPS DOWN and walks over to him

REMY
You really shouldn’t be here during
restaurant hours it’s not safe

EMILE
I’m hungry And I don’t need the
inside food to be happy The key
my friend is to not be picky
Observe

Emile lifts the corner of a toppled-over BOX exposing a
chunk of CHEESE Emile chuckles reaching for the cheese--

REMY
No-- WAIT--

Remy grabs Emile’s tail and pulls him clear A HINGE DROPS
trapping Remy inside a CAGE Emile rushes to Remy panicked

EMILE
Oh no What’1ll we do I’1l go get
Dad

A SHADOW looms over them Emile quickly hides SKINNER picks
up the trapcage grinning ear to ear

SKINNER
You may think you are a chef but
you are still only a rat

KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The cooks are sitting now bored out of their minds Linguini
is still talking

LINGUINI (CONTD)
-sure he took away a star last time
he reviewed this place Sure it
probably killed Gust-- Dad

LALO
(softly to himself)
Oh this is very bad juju here-o

LINGUINI (CONTD)
But I’1l tell you one thing--

Mustafa bursts through the dining room door interrupting--

MUSTAFA
Ego is here

The air is suddenly sucked from the room The cooks stand
alert frightened Sensing what is needed Colette steps up

COLETTE
Arnot Ego is just another customer
Let’s cook

An intent look sweeps the faces of the staff With a burst of
grunts cries and hand claps they return to work

LINGUINI
(a beat too late)
Yeah-- Let’s-- okay

STREET NEAR GUSTEAU’S - MOMENTS LATER

Remy’s cage is set down inside the trunk of SKINNER’S CAR
Remy looks up at Skinner

SKINNER
So I have in mind a simple arrange-
ment you will create for me a new
line of Chef Skinner frozen foods
and I in return will not kill
you

Remy STARTLES looks aghast Laughing Skinner SLAMS SHUT the
trunk and EXITS toward the restaurant Nearby EMILE watches
cautiously

SKINNER
Au revoir rat
GUSTEAU’S RESTAURANT - DINING AREA - NIGHT

Mustafa draws a deep breath gathering courage He turns and
approaches Ego’s table

MUSTAFA
Do you know what you’d like this
evening sir

Ego lifts his gaze to Mustafa

EGO
Yes I think I do After reading a
lot of overheated puffery about
your new cook you know what I’m
craving A little perspective

Ego SNAPS his menu shut and hands it to Mustafa

EGO
That’s it I’d like some fresh
clear well-seasoned perspective
Can you suggest a good wine to go
with that

MUSTAFA
(baffled)
With what sir

EGO
Perspective Fresh out I take it

MUSTAFA
Uh I’m sorry

MUSTAFA
Very well Since you’re all out of
perspective and no one else seems
to have it in this bloody town
I’1l make you a deal you provide
the food I’1l provide the
perspective Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947

MUSTAFA
Uhm I’m afraid I-- I didn’t
your dinner selection

Ego jumps to his feet suddenly eye to eye with Mustafa

EGO
Tell your “Chef Linguini” that I
want whatever he dares to serve to
me Tell him to “hit me with his
best shot”

Mustafa scurries off Seated at a nearby table (and disguised
in a trenchcoat sunglasses and beret) SKINNER jerks his
head toward Ego and speaks to his waiter--

SKINNER
(deep voice)
I will have whatever he is having

INSIDE SKINNER’S CAR TRUNK

Remy sits in the corner of his cage alone and defeated The
GUSTEAU SPRITE appears He studies Remy speaking quietly

GUSTEAU
So we’ve given up

REMY
Why do you say that

GUSTEAU
(looks around shrugs)
We are in a cage Inside a car
trunk Awaiting a future in frozen
food products

REMY
No I’m the one in a cage I’ve
given up You are free

GUSTEAU
I am only as free as you imagine me
to be As you are

REMY
Oh please I’m sick of pretending
I pretend to be a rat for my
father I pretend to be a human
through Linguini I pretend you
exist so I have someone to talk to
You only tell me stuff I already
know I know who I am Why do I
need you to tell me Why do I need
to pretend

Gusteau smiles with affection and relief

GUSTEAU
Ah but you don’t Remy

He floats to Remy puts his hands squarely on the rat’s
shoulders
GUSTEAU (CONTD)

you never did

And with that Gusteau FADES AWAY A loud THUNK as
something hits the street pavement outside

CATHEDRAL ACROSS FROM GUSTEAU’S - DUSK

A STONE GARGOYLE has just missed the trunk of Skinner’s car
and SHATTERED on the pavement DJANGO clearly annoyed calls
to GIT the musclebound lab rat who’s perched on the one
gargoyle-less balustrade above

DJANGO
No My OTHER left

Git grunts moves to the next gargoyle and PUSHES--

INSIDE SKINNER’S CAR TRUNK
Remy alert and excited now calls out

REMY
Dad

WHAM --the top of the trunk suddenly CAVES IN from the
second GARGOYLE’s impact Light streams in as EMILE appears

REMY
Emile

Django joins Emile as he grabs the cage latch from the
outside Straining with all their might the three rats pop
it open Remy jumps out gives Django and Emile quick hugs--

REMY
I love you guys

-then scrambles out the trunk and takes off toward GUSTEAU’S

DJANGO
Where you going

REMY
(calling back)
Back to the restaurant They’1l
fail without me

DJANGO
WHY DO YOU CARE

REMY
BECAUSE I’M A COOK

INSIDE KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S - SAME TIME

CHAOS Tempers are flaring orders are piling up and the
kitchen is dissolving under Linguini’s leadership Holding a
pan filled with grey glop Horst confronts Linguini

HORST

It’s your recipe How can you not

know your own recipe

LINGUINI

I didn’t write it down it just--

came to me

HORST

Well make it come to you again
because we can’t serve this

MUSTAFA
Where’s my order

LA ROUSSE
This is what they’re
ordering

POMPIDOU
We can’t be all out we just
opened-

COLETTE
We will make it Just tell us
what you did

HORST
We need to tell the customers
something

LINGUINI
Can’t we serve them something
else Something I didn’t
invent

LINGUINI
Make them order something
else Tell them we’re all
out

LA ROUSSE
I have another idea what if
we served them what they
order

LINGUINI
I don’t know what I did

LINGUINI
(hysteria building)
Then tell them-- tell them--
AUGH

Linguini runs into his office and slams the door closed

LA ROUSSE
(to Lalo beat)

“Rugh”

OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAU’S - SAME TIME

Django and Emile rush to stop Remy as he heads toward the
kitchen door--

DJANGO EMILE
Remy They’1ll see you STOP

--but Remy pushes them away long enough to get inside the
doorway exposing himself to two COOKS The other rats HIDE

COLETTE
He’s come far too fast Could you
do more with as little experience

HORST
We are not talking about me We’re
talking about what to do right n--

Horst suddenly FREEZES-- his gaze fixed on the back entrance
There smack dab in the middle of the doorway sits REMY as
brash as a tiny gunslinger entering a saloon

COLETTE
RAAAAT

Instantly the other COOKS seize dangerous utencils and CHARGE
at Remy But REMY DOESN’T MOVE Suddenly a voice SHOUTS--

LINGUINI
DON’T TOUCH HIM

Miraculously everyone STOPS their weapons raised their
gaze shifting to LINGUINI who rushes in front of the group

LINGUINI
I know this sounds insane But-
well the truth sounds insane
sometimes but that doesn’t mean
it’s not The truth

The COOKS exchange confused glances

LINGUINI
And the truth is I have no talent
at all But this Rat he’s the
one behind these recipes He’s the
cook The real cook Little Chef

The COOKS watch in amazement as Remy hops onto his lowered
palm Linguini lifts Remy up to his head to demonstrate

LINGUINI (CONTD)
He’s been hiding under my toque He
chooses the ingredients the spices-

Linguini picks up some spices lifting them to Remy’s nose
The other cooks react this strange and familiar action of
Linguini’s is suddenly stranger than ever

LINGUINI (CONTD)
--he’s been controlling my actions

Remy gives Linguini’s hair a few tugs to demonstrate
Linguini’s limbs move correspondingly

LINGUINI (CONTD)
He’s the reason I can cook the food
that’s exciting everyone the
reason Ego is outside that door
You’ve been giving me credit for
his gift I know it’s a hard thing
to believe but hey-- you believed
I could cook right

Linguini laughs The cooks stare He looks at them earnest

LINGUINI
Look This works It’s crazy but
it works We can be the greatest
restaurant in Paris And this rat
this brilliant little Chef can lead
us there Whaddya say You with me

For a moment no one moves Then HORST tears welling up in
his eyes crosses to a grateful moved Linguini and--

--hands him his apron and toque EXITING silently out the
back door Linguini watches-- stunned-- as one by one the
rest of the STAFF exits with him leaving only COLETTE

Colette locks eyes with Linguini both anger and tears
welling up Her hand comes up to slap him--

--but doesn’t Her hand just trembles and finally drops to
her side She pushes past Linguini and out the door

Linguini looks out at Dining room Ego WAITS drumming his
fingers Soon the customers will get restless Linguini
exchanges a sad look with Remy shrinks into his office
closes the door behind him

PARIS STREETS - MOVING WITH COLETTE - NIGHT

COLETTE speeds her motorcycle recklessly through the streets
crying A car horn BLASTS She STARTLES hits the brakes and
skids TO A STOP nearly running the red light

She exhales her heart racing at the close call She looks
up A familiar COOKBOOK beckons from the display window of a
used book store Gusteau’s “ANYONE CAN COOK”

Colette stares at it feeling a pang of emotion
CLOSE ON THE COOKBOOK
CLOSE ON COLETTE Behind her the traffic light TURNS green

WIDE SHOT The traffic on either side of her begins to go
Colette sits atop her motorcycle-- motionless

RESUME GUSTEAU’S KITCHEN

Alone in the empty kitchen Remy faces the dining room door
feeling Ego on the other side waiting Remy slowly turns
away then realizes that DJANGO is also there

REMY
Dad--
(he goes to Django)
Dad I-- I don’t know what to say

DJANGO
I was wrong about your friend And
about you

REMY
Dad I don’t want you to think I’m
choosing this over family I can’t
choose between two halves of myself-

DJANGO
I’m not talking about cooking I’m
talking about guts This really
means that much to you

Almost apologetically Remy NODS Django sighs then lets out
a loud whistle The RAT CLAN emerges from the shadows
quickly surrounding them

DJANGO
We’re not cooks but we are family
You tell us what to do and we’1l
get it done

A DOOR CREAK turns the rats attention to the back door where--

--THE HEALTH INSPECTOR has just entered His eyes bug at the
surreal sight the KITCHEN IS FILLED WITH RATS Slowly he
backs toward the EXIT and BOLTS

REMY
STOP THAT HEALTH INSPECTOR

Immediately DJANGO leads half the RAT CLAN after the
inspector yelling as he exits out the door

DJANGO
DELTA TEAM FOLLOW ME THE REST OF
YOU STAY AND HELP REMY

ALLEY BEHIND GUSTEAU’S - INSIDE INSPECTOR’S CAR

The inspector JAMS his keys into the ignition and turns The
ENGINE won’t turn over He glances at the rear view mirror
and sees a ground-level STAMPEDE OF RATS moving out from the
kitchen TOWARD HIM

The RATS engulf the car covering it like a blanket The
ENGINE comes to life Tires SQUEAL smoking as the car roars
from the alley in reverse and pulls a 180 into the street
the rats covering it like a grey moss--

KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The dishwasher opens with a WHOOSH of steam DOZENS OF RATS
EMERGE their fur clean and fluffy They disperse with Swat
Team precision as Remy barks orders

REMY
TEAM THREE WILL BE HANDLING FISH
TEAM FOUR ROASTED ITEMS TEAM
FIVE GRILL TEAM SIX SAUCES GET
TO YOUR STATIONS LET’S GO GO GO

LINGUINI

Emerges from his office and is astonished by the sight Remy
and the rats see this is suddenly PAUSE Linguini walks up to
Remy suddenly filled with purpose

LINGUINI
We need someone to wait tables

Remy NODS CUT TO

CHEFS OFFICE

Linguini turns his backpack upside down A pair of ROLLER
BLADES hit his desk with a CLUNK

DINING AREA

Linguini wearing the blades and a WAITERS OUTFIT explodes
through the double doors and sweeps into the dining room
distributing MENUS to the diners with economical precision
followed miraculously by DRINKS BREAD WATER

He arrives at Skinner’s table to refill his water

LINGUINI
No I’m sorry for any delay but
were a little short tonight

Skinner glances at EGO who is scowling as he scribbles in a
note pad A big smile stretches across Skinners face

SKINNER
Please Take all the time you need

KITCHEN

The kitchen is going like blazes RATS are sauteing spicing
grilling cooking up a storm Remy nearly overwhelmed with
the scale of production is miraculously handling it

Stationed at the pass EMILE wipes the sauce of the edges of
the plates with a cloth the last crucial bit of quality
control Tempted by the sauce he tries to sneak a lick

REMY (0S) EMILE
EMILE (stopping himself)
Sorry

DINING AREA - SAME TIME
Ego looks impatiently at his watch scribbles in his notepad

Then his eyes fall to the soup He pulls the bowl to him
dips a spoon in TASTING IT Not bad

KITCHEN

The RATS are functioning like a well-oiled machine the
perfectly prepared meals hit the pass as quickly as Linguini
can grab them The back door pushes open to REVEAL

COLETTE-- staggered by the bizarre spectacle Looking like
she may vomit she wheels back to the exit when Linguini
rushes in throwing his arms around her

LINGUINI
Colette You came back Colette I--

COLETTE
DON’T say a word If I think about
it I might change my mind Just
tell me what the rat wants to cook

MOMENTS LATER

Remy flips through Gusteau’s recipe box finds a certain card
and pulls it showing it to Colette She frowns

COLETTE
Ratatouille It’s a peasant dish
Are you sure you want to serve this
to Ego

Remy NODS Colette shrugs and starts to prepare the dish

A TIRE SCREECH is followed by a LOUD CRASH outside COLETTE
looks up as the back door bangs open the HEALTH INSPECTOR
bound and gagged floats across the floor on a cushion of
RATS who quickly dump him in the food safe

Colette shrugs going with the strange night and goes to add
the first spice to the ratatouille but is blocked by a
WOODEN SPOON She looks up sees it’s held by Remy

COLETTE
What I’m making the ratatouille

He looks at the her ingredients and makes a face

COLETTE
Well how would you prepare it

Remy PAUSES considering this

KITCHEN DINING AREA

INTERCUT Remy REIMAGINING the ratatouille re-inventing
it step by step and demonstrating what he wants to Colette
who expertly follows through-- WITH LINGUINI skating
around the dining room a ONE-MAN WAIT STAFF

MUSIC CRESCENDOS as LINGUINI delivers the meal to EGO’S
TABLE Linguini then serves the identical meal to Skinner
who’s appalled and amused to find that Ego has been served--

SKINNER
Ratatouille They must be joking

He looks over at Ego who seems equally unimpressed

ON EGO

He pokes a fork into the vegetables examines them for a
moment then brings the food to his lips--

Linguini watches withering

As Ego’s lips close around the ratatouille the sound the
restaurant around him is WHISKED AWAY--

FLASHBACK FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - A LIFETIME AGO

We are inside a cozy cottage on a golden summer day The
front door is open a newly crashed BICYCLE lays on the
ground outside Next to it stands a five year old ANTON EGO
with a skinned knee valiantly holding back tears

His young mother turns from her cooking and gives hima
sympathetic smile Like all mothers she knows what to do
MOMENTS LATER

Young EGO already feeling better is at a table His mother
touches his cheek and sets a freshly made bowl of ratatouille
before him warm and inviting The boy takes a spoonful into
his mouth--

--AND THE PRESENT RUSHES BACK--

Ego is frozen Astounded His PEN slips from his hand It
CLATTERS to the floor breaking the spell

Ego blinks His eyes fall to his empty fork which he holds
suspended near his mouth Slowly a long-lost feeling blooms
inside him He smiles And has another forkful

Skinner has seen this He looks at his ratatouille and tastes
it He’s stunned loving and hating it all at once--

SKINNER
(as he eats)
No no it can’t be

KITCHEN
Skinner BURSTS through the double doors

SKINNER
Who cooked the ratatouille I
demand to know

A kitchen full of RATS all stop and LOOK UP AT HIM CUT TO--

INSIDE FOOD SAFE

Skinner bound and gagged is tossed roughly into the corner
where he lands next to the equally bound and gagged HEALTH
INSPECTOR They yell muffled protests as the door slams shut

DINING AREA

A long FINGER dabs the last smear of remaining sauce from the
plate of ratatouille We follow it to Ego’s smiling lips He
kisses the sauce off his finger tip and turns to Linguini

EGO
I can’t remember the last time I
asked a waiter to give my
compliments to the Chef And now I
find myself in the extraordinary
position of having my waiter be the
Chef

LINGUINI
I’m just your waiter tonight

EGO
Then who do I thank for the meal

Linguini stares for a moment wondering how to respond

LINGUINI
Excuse me a minute

Linguini skates to the kitchen doors where Colette has been
watching from a distance Ego squints Linguini and Colette
are visible through the window panels in a heated discussion
Linguini returns to Ego’s table this time with Colette

EGO
Ah you must be the Ch--

COLETTE
(interrupts)
If you wish to meet the Chef you
will have to wait until all the
other customers have gone

Taken aback by the unprecedented demand Ego acquiesces

EGO
So be it

Colette and Linguini exchange a look DISSOLVE TO

LATER The restaurant has cleared save for Ego who waits
with grim patience Linguini and Colette emerge from the
kitchen and silently cross to Ego’s table Linguini holding a
toque upright on the flat of and outstretched hand

Ego stares his curiosity piqued by this strange sight
Linguini takes a breath and lifts up the toque revealing
REMY sitting up on the palm of his hand

REMY (VO)
At first Ego thinks it’s a joke
but as Linguini explains Ego’s
smile disappears

A SERIES OF SHOTS Inside the rat-filled kitchen Linguini
and Remy demonstrate their unique working style to Ego first
together then with Remy alone Colette withers as Ego STARES
at this in grim deadpan

REMY (VO)
He doesn’t react beyond asking an
occasional question

DINING AREA
Linguini and Colette are now seated at a table opposite Ego

Remy sits on the table facing Ego who occasionally glances
down at him Finally Ego gets up and bows slightly

REMY (VO)
And when the story is done Ego
stands thanks us for the meal--

EGO
Thank you for the meal

REMY (VO CONT’)
--and leaves without another word

EGO’S OFFICE - NIGHT

In a SERIES OF SHOTS Ego is seen pacing brooding staring
out one of the enormous picture windows flanking his portrait
into the night visibly unsettled

REMY (VO)
The following day his review
appears

EGO (VO)

In many ways the work of a critic
is easy We risk very little yet
enjoy a position over those who
offer up their work and their
selves to our judgement We thrive
on negative criticism which is fun
to write and to read

-until finally he sits down at his desk and begins to write

EGO (VO)

But the bitter truth we critics
must face is that in the grand
scheme of things the average
piece of junk is probably more
meaningful than our criticism
designating it so But there are
times when a critic truly risks
something and that is in the
discovery and defense of the new

MONTAGE AFTER CLOSING - NIGHT (TO DAWN)
Linguini and Colette emerge from Gusteau’s kitchen into the

brisk night air Remy with them walking upright No one
knows what to think Colette and Linguini HUG anyway

EGO (VO)
The world is often unkind to new
talent new creations The new
needs friends

In the alley behind the kitchen the strange humanrat
alliance amicably part ways and head to their respective
homes above and below the streets of Paris Only Remy stays
behind electing to take in the night and think

EGO (VO)
Last night I experienced something
new an extraordinary meal from an
singularly unexpected source
To say that both the meal and its
maker have challenged my
preconceptions about fine cooking
is a gross understatement-- they
have rocked me to my core

EGO’S VO CONTINUES as we DISSOLVE between LINGUINI
COLETTE EMILE and DJANGO and see that no one rat or human-
is able to sleep this night

EGO (VO CONT’D)
In the past I have made no secret
of my disdain for Chef Gusteau’s
famous motto “Anyone Can Cook”
But I realize only now do I truly
understand what he meant Not
everyone can become a great artist
but a great artist can come from

anywhere

MONTAGE CONCLUDES with REMY staring at the Eiffel Tower as
the sky creeps into dawn

EGO (VOCONT’D)
It is difficult to imagine more
humble origins than those of the
genius now cooking at Gusteau’s
who is in this critic’s opinion
nothing less than the finest Chef
in France

KITCHEN - GUSTEAU’S - MORNING
VO CONTINUES as a Colette and Linguini read EGO’S REVIEW--
EGO (VOCONT’D)

I will be returning to Gusteau’s
soon hungry for more

Colette and Linguini HUG Gathered with them in Gusteau’s
kitchen Remy and the rat clan CHEER

REMY (VO)
It was a great night The happiest
of my life But the only thing
predictable about life is its--

SHOT A bored worker for the MINISTRY OF HEALTH pastes
“CLOSED” notices over the front door of GUSTEAU’S

REMY (VO CONT)
--unpredictability We had to let
Skinner and the health inspector
loose and of course they squealed
The food didn’t matter Once it got
out there were rats in the kitchen
the restaurant was closed and Ego
lost his job and his credibility
But don’t feel too bad for him

A BISTRO - DAY - THE PRESENT

In a tiny warmly lit room a GROUP OF RATS (including DJANGO
and EMILE) are seated around a basket which has been
overturned and covered with a napkin to function as a table
listening as REMY finishes his story

REMY (CONT’D)
-he’s doing very well as a small
business investor He seems very

happy

Seated next to Remy a teenage rat frowns skeptical

TEEN RAT
How do you know

Remy smiles and points through the small window into the main
dining room There ANTON EGO whose face now has color and a
few new pounds dines happily at a prime table

A small BELL rings Remy glances down into the kitchen
Colette is looking up at him tapping her wristwatch

REMY
(to other rats)
Gotta go Dinner rush

He takes off jumping into a counter-weighted BASKET made
especially for him He’s quickly dropped into the kitchen

BISTRO KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The BASKET with Remy drops to the counter and Remy hops off
Colette sets down a plate of Remy’s now-famous Ratatouille
leaving the finish to Remy

COLETTE
You know how he likes it

Remy nods and quickly expertly finishes the presentation WE
FOLLOW LINGUINI now the Maitre ‘d as he takes the plate
into the dining room and delivers it to Ego

LINGUINI
Can I interest you in a dessert
this evening

EGO
Don’t you always

LINGUINI
Which one would you like

Ego grins turns toward the window in the kitchen door where
Remy is watching and calls out--

EGO
Surprise me

Remy signals Ego in the affirmative and goes off to create
something delicious

CAMERA pulls away from this happy scene to reveal--
--a BISTRO jammed with open-minded foodies a hip cultured
mixture of bohemians of all ages all there to enjoy good

food and life

CAMERA CONTINUES out the window and we are--

OUTSIDE THE BISTRO - PARIS - DUSK

A long line of customers has formed outside waiting to get
in An elegant METAL SIGN comes into view featuring a rat
wearing a CHEF’S TOQUE along with the bistro’s name--

LA KATATOWILLE

FINE’ (THE END)
