EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

A BUM hobbles through a dark alley the RAIN pouring down
He approaches a garbage can and rummages through it as a
church bell marks the hour

BANG - a gunshot rings out

There’s no one in any direction - until a SHADOW overtakes
him The bum looks up to see a MAN falling toward him

CUT TO

Water pours from a sink faucet We are in

INT JIM GORDON’S HOUSE - NIGHT
JIM GORDON stands at his kitchen sink and cleans up
after dinner His hair is white his glasses thick - a shell

of the man he once was To his surprise

The RED GLOW OF A ROTARY PHONE illuminates from the study

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Gordon arrives in a modest sedan a red light clamped to the
roof of his car

COP 1
Commissioner right this way

Gordon pulls the collar up on his raincoat and makes his way
into the alley Cops swarm the area when--

POOF - blue smoke sends a group of officers to their knees

O’ HARA
Get back

Hollering over the scene is CLANCY O’HARA the Chief of
Police He’s an imposing man wearing dress blues and thin
glasses a thick Irish accent curling every word
Gordon steps closer covering his mouth from the fumes The
smoke clears to reveal

BATMAN lying in a pool of blood Gordon stares slack-jawed
CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHERS do their job snapping dozens of
photos We only catch glimpses of Batman’s body his costume
- navy against gray with a metallic mustard-colored belt

GORDON
Is he

O’ HARA
Dead Who knows

A CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR tries to collect a GREEN HAIR from
Batman’s fist when - ZAP He receives an electrical shock

O’ HARA
We can’t get close enough to find
out

Gordon removes his badge Tucked into the leather backing is
a COIN embossed with the BAT SYMBOL In kneeling closer a
magnetic force pulls the coin from Gordon’s fingers and into
a slot on Batman’s belt The buckle unlatches his defenses
disarmed

CUT TO

EXT DESERT - DAY

A COMMUNICATOR glows red It’s sewn into the belt of an
iconic hero who needs no introduction Despite the silver
that graces his hair SUPERMAN aka CLARK KENT is still
an awesome sight to behold With childlike ease he wrestles
a tank to its side his costume awash in sand and oil

Amid the chaos of exploding missiles and burning corpses he
switches off the comm and launches skyward

BACK TO
EXT ALLEY - SAME
A cop taps Batman with his billy club

COP 1
He’s good All clear

One of the cops reaches for his cowl

COP 2
Let’s get a look

GORDON
Get back

Gordon draws his gun He doesn’t point it at anyone in
particular but the message is clear

O’ HARA
Jim-

GORDON
I SAID GET BACK

The surrounding cops do as he says A wave of emotion washes
over Gordon as he searches Batman for a pulse

GORDON
(to a Paramedic)
Bring the cart

MEDIC
(to OHara)
He’s been lying there for twenty
minutes

GORDON
BRING THE GOD DAMN CART

The medics bring over a defibrillator They try to
resuscitate Batman with no results Eventually the medics
stop however Gordon keeps trying performing manual CPR
GORDON
Get up get up

There’s no fighting it - the Batman is dead A mix of anger
and sadness overcome Gordon and he collapses to the pavement
He weeps like a child as SUPERMAN descends into the alley

CUT TO

An elaborate building constructed of white marble and blue
glass sits at the heart of a bustling city This is

EXT HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT

A soothing fountain trickles out front All is peaceful
until a COMPUTER CONSOLE comes flying out the window

MAN (0S)
Nice try hot pants

INSIDE THE BUILDING

A MAN dressed in a crimson unitard snickers while admiring
the damage Seen here without his mask on the slick blond
hair and shit-eating grin belong to BARRY ALLEN or as
he’s more commonly known - THE FLASH

FLASH
---ebut you still throw like a girl

Fashioned in knee-high boots and a patriotic bustier DIANA
PRINCE aka WONDER WOMAN isn’t one to piss off She
grabs a decorative statue from the corner of the room and
tears it from its base

FLASH
Oh now that’s impressive

Wonder Woman brings the statue down for a crushing blow
however the Flash dodges his movements immeasurably fast
The statue hammers into the floor shattering to pieces
FLASH
Especially for someone your age

She prowls after him knocking over everything in her way

WONDER WOMAN
You’re gonna learn some respect

FLASH
This coming from a grown woman in a
bikini three sizes too small

Seething Wonder Woman rips a gigantic iron globe from the
wall and hurls it toward him To her surprise it’s
intercepted by a spectral GREEN GORILLA

This is the work of HAL JORDAN aka the GREEN LANTERN
He’s decked in a green body suit and armed with an emerald
RING the source of his power

GREEN LANTERN
That’s enough

FLASH
Nice monkey

The Flash zips across the room stopping inches away from
Green Lantern’s face

FLASH
Youre pretty tough with that ring
on your finger aren’t ya

The gorilla leans closer snarling when the communicators on
everyone’s belts glow in unison

FLASH
Wonderful

The Flash switches off his comm and makes for the building’s
main computer - an enormous wall of new-wave technology
Rising from a dark pool at the back of the room is ARTHUR
CURRY aka AQUAMAN the king of the seas Long matted
hair drapes down in front of his eyes his beard unkempt A
jacket of sleek bronze armor clings to his torso He shuts
off his comm adding

AQUAMAN
This better be good

The Flash switches on the computer powering the building’s
external cameras Silence fills the room as the monitor
gives view to Superman in mid-flight He descends from the
night sky holding Batman in his arms

EXT SUBURBS - MORNING

Gordon parks his car in front of a quaint brick house He
takes a drink from a small flask before exiting his vehicle

INSIDE THE HOUSE

BARBARA GRAYSON an attractive redhead readies herself
for a meeting She’s all smiles and warmth

BARBARA
Should I wear pearls or silver

In the background DICK GRAYSON makes breakfast for
their daughter BETHANY Dick’s more average than he is
handsome with a thick beard a receding hairline and a
heavy pair of glasses

DICK
What do you think Should Mommy
wear pearls or silver

BETHANY
Banana

DICK
Of course banana
Barbara pokes her head out from the bathroom

BARBARA
Pearls Or silver

DICK
Silver

She plucks a breakfast sausage from the table and kisses him

DICK
You got your cell phone

She grabs her cell off the counter

BARBARA
I forget this thing everywhere

DING-DONG Barbara and Dick share a look

BARBARA
Ha See what happens when you ask
nicely

She strides toward the door

DICK
So now every morning he’s gonna
hand-deliver it

BARBARA
Maybe he wants to apologize for
leaving it in the bushes and in
the street and everywhere but the
front door

She opens the door to see GORDON

BARBARA
Dad What a nice surprise

She greets him with a hug - and then sees
BARBARA
I swear
(marches outside)
That kid’s gonna turn me into the
old lady on the block who complains
about everything

She marches into the neighbor’s yard and bends down to get
the newspaper her back clearly causing her discomfort

BARBARA
You want some breakfast Dick’s
making his famous pancakes
Gordon doesn’t respond
BARBARA
What’s wrong
BACK IN THE KITCHEN

Dick slides a pancake onto a plate

DICK
How ‘bout a little syrup

Dick dots the pancake with a syrup happy face and looks
toward the entryway to see Barbara with tear-filled eyes
EXT HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

Dick drives up to the building and squeals to a stop He
hops to the pavement and storms past a dozen police cars
already parked out front

Gordon arrives shortly after him

GORDON
Dick wait

Dick enters the building behind one of the policemen
INSIDE

O’Hara and a group of cops mill about Dick brushes past
them

COP 1
Hey this building’s off limits-

Dick folds back the cop’s wrist and sends him to the floor
The other cops react however Dick’s not in the mood for
games He starts dishing out blows and sends five officers
to their backs before--

A blur of RED catches him in the jaw knocking him off his
feet

FLASH
That had to hurt

The cops cuff Dick as Gordon enters the room

GORDON
Stop All of you Take those
cuffs off him

O’ HARA
Now wait a minute that man just-

GORDON
That man is Dick Grayson

O’ HARA
Dick
(to the cops)
Help him up

The cops lift Dick to his feet his lip now bleeding O’Hara
hands him a handkerchief
O’ HARA
Didn’t recognize you Not that it
Matters You just assaulted six

officers

GORDON
And he got what he deserved Now
let’s remember why were here

OHara steps closer invading Gordon’s personal space

OHARA
Yes and why is he here It’s
rather an inopportune time to allow
your son-in-law to tag along
wouldn’t you say

WONDER WOMAN and a PATHOLOGIST enter the room

WONDER WOMAN
Gunshot wound to the chest

The cops mumble in disbelief

GORDON
He’s been shot before

PATHOLOGIST
This was point blank Forty-four
caliber No signs of struggle no
scratches bruises or broken bones
that can’t be attributed to the
fall

The Pathologist gets a signature from O’Hara

PATHOLOGIST
If it makes you feel any better
Jim he probably never saw it
comin’

DICK
I want to see him

O’Hara eyes Dick curiously - why would he want to see him

SUPERMAN (0S)
No

Superman enters the room Without his trademark smile he’s
an intimidating force a living god dressed in primary
colors
SUPERMAN
No one sees him That was his

request and we all will honor it

CUT TO

ROLL CREDITS OVER

A mason chisels stone The onyx sculpture stands thirty feet
tall - its features undefined

INT CITY HALL - DAY

Chief O’Hara storms down the hall with a throng of reporters
in his wake pictures flashing

REPORTER
Is it true the Joker was at the
crime scene

O’ HARA
We will find Batmans killer and
bring him to justice That is all
CLARK KENT is among the reporters He turns to see Dick
watching from afar

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

Rain comes down as a crippled old man ALFRED PENNYWORTH exits a vehicle with the use of a WHEELCHAIR LIFT

He joins a procession of mourners all following a casket
bearing the Bat Symbol

The pallbearers include on one side Commissioner Gordon
Aquaman and the Flash on the other side are Wonder Woman
Green Lantern and Superman

As the funeral plays out Dick and Barbara stand among a
privileged group of five hundred policemen and politicians
Thousands of others line the fence their umbrellas entwined
into an endless canopy that encircles the cemetery

Among the crowd Barbara spots SELINA KYLE a stunning
brunette with wicked curves She leans closer to Dick
whispering

BARBARA
Selina she’s got no business
here

Their attention shifts at the SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING It’s
Gordon his emotions send him to his knees Barbara goes to
his side leaving Dick in the crowd His expression doesn’t
blend with the sullen faces around him There’s an anger
brewing

And O’Hara notices He watches in curiosity as Dick looks up
at the GRAVESTONE towering over them It’s an astounding
monument both beautiful and frightening Lifting from its
center are two massive wings forming an ominous black shape
resembling neither man nor bat but something in between
Along its base reads “Whatever evils come this way we will
be here to stop them - The Batman Justice League of
America” Dick gazes at the monument a fire in his eyes

INT GORDON’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Friends gather to reminisce O’Hara among them At the

opposite end of the room Dick sits by himself and polishes
off a bottle of Scotch

GORDON
Whoa slow down on that stuff while
you still have the sense to

DICK
You see the headlines

Gordon exhales a sigh and sits next to him

GORDON
I read them this morning

DICK
And

GORDON
And I suppose we should have
suspected

Dick beams him with a look Gordon leans closer attempting
to keep the conversation private

GORDON
Let’s think it through He escapes
Arkham the same night - they find
traces of his hair on Bruce’s body
and forensics confirmed that the
weapon used was his gun of choice
a Smith and Wesson large-frame
revolver with a forty-four caliber
round Hell an inch from his
chest even the strongest Kevlar
can’t compete with that

DICK
You don’t get it

GORDON
Dick I know how close you were
and maybe I don’t know you’re

feeling guilty for having left
things the way you did

DICK

The Joker was the exception to the
rule With him we had a strike-
first policy That means no
warning no chance to surrender
just--

(smacks his fist)
--bring him down Hell Bruce
would never let that lunatic get
right up on him - and put a god
damn gun up against his chest

GORDON
Shhh

DICK
I don’t care who hears

The room quiets to a hush

GORDON
Dick why don’t we go for a walk-

Dick stands and stumbles into Gordon

DICK
I know there’s more to this

He exits slamming the door behind him

BARBARA
Dick honey

Barbara hurries after him but he’s already started the car
and pulled away from the house

BARBARA
Dick Wait You’ve had too much
to drink

O’ HARA

Not to worry We’ll get him before
he hurts himself

OHara motions for a few other cops to leave with him They
get in separate cars and follow after Dick

EXT WAYNE MANOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Dick stands outside the gates of Wayne Manor and stares at
the mansion the rain hammering down Car headlights pass
only to turn back around It’s O’Hara He eyes Dick
curiously before grabbing his umbrella and joining him

OHARA
What is it they say “You can’t go
home again” Hmff you were

what eight years old when Bruce
took you in

Dick doesn’t respond O’Hara prods further

OHARA
Where is Mr Wayne anyway I
would’ve figured he’d show up at
the funeral what with the media
attention and all Of course
Bruce never really approved of the
Batman’s methods did he In fact
when you think about it he was
rather outspoken against him You
on the other hand

Dick turns and heads back to his vehicle
O’ HARA
Where you goin’ Dick Or should I
call you Robin

Dick stops and tries to play it off

DICK
What

OHARA
Oh please you waded through
half a dozen of my finest like they
were little girls And why To
get to the Batman as if he was
your own father

DICK
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

OHARA

Bullshit You’re the circus boy in
the yellow cape It’s hard to see
with that beard of yours but I’m
as sure of it as I am my own name
What I’m wondering is who else
knows

(look to the Manor)
Did you keep it from Bruce

Dick doesn’t answer

O’ HARA
No you couldn’t lie to him could
ya He treated you like a son

O’Hara’s face turns white as he makes the realization

OHARA
Sure and Begorrah the father and
the son Bruce Wayne and Dick
Grayson the Dynamic Duo

Dick grabs him by the collar and throws him against the gate

DICK
You start spreading nonsense like
that and you’re gonna wish the
Batman was around to save you
17

O’ HARA
(grins)
Laddy I’m the Chief of Police
And while I have no interest in
announcing your little secret

Like a pit bull he turns on Dick with surprising strength
freeing himself from his grip

O’ HARA
I’1l not be threatened

O’Hara picks up his umbrella
O’ HARA
Oh and a bit of advice You’ve
been out of that silly costume for
what now twelve years I suggest

you keep it that way

He returns his car and drives off leaving Dick in the rain

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Dick enters the lobby and heads for the stairs however he
catches the eye of Desk Sergeant LAWRENCE JOHNSON an elderly

black officer with a pencil-thin mustache

LAWRENCE
Can I help you

Dick walks over to the desk and shakes his hand

DICK
Dick Grayson how do you do

LAWRENCE
Grayson Bruce Wayne’s nephew
DICK
No but I get that a lot
Technically he was my legal
guardian

LAWRENCE
Well on behalf of the precinct I
want you to thank him for us Mr
Wayne swooped in and bankrolled our
pension fund when the Mayor said
otherwise

DICK
That sounds like Bruce

LAWRENCE
A great man

DICK
I’1l make sure to pass that along

LAWRENCE
Now what can I do for you Mr
Grayson

DICK
Oh I was just gonna get some files
out of the Chief’s office

LAWRENCE
Files

DICK
The Chief’s back at the house we
were planning to roll up our
sleeves burn a little midnight oil
on this whole Batman thing but
Linda had a little too much to
drink though you didn’t hear that
from me

LAWRENCE
Hear what

The two men laugh

LAWRENCE
Okay then

Dick heads for the stairs
LAWRENCE
Let me just get the Chief on the
line to verify

Lawrence picks up the phone and starts dialing

DICK
Right sure

Dick pulls out his keys
DICK
Sorry he gave me the keys to his

office I wasn’t even thinking

LAWRENCE
Gave ya the keys eh

Lawrence hesitates then continues dialing

LAWRENCE
Just to be sure

Six policemen enter the station with a MOB OF PEOPLE to book
all shouting and shoving Lawrence hangs up waves Dick
through and turns his attention to the crisis at hand

IN THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Dick nears an office door that reads CHIEF OF POLICE across

the glass He pockets his keys and with the aid of a credit
card picks the lock

INSIDE O’HARA’S OFFICE
Dick enters only to discover--

A HOODED THIEF rummaging through the files With cat-like
agility the thief escapes out the window Dick hurries to
the ledge - it’s a long way down but he pursues

ROOFTOPS

Dick’s out of shape but manages to stay in the chase This
is the ultimate in rooftop rundowns - pure adrenaline with
more than a few near-fatal mishaps It weaves its way
through a few apartments and builds to an astounding LEAP
between buildings The thief displays a level of acrobatics
not found in most crooks

Dick follows--
And comes up short barely clearing the distance He catches
the fire escape which BREAKS leaving him dangling over the

street five stories up

DICK
Selina

Dick gets the reaction he was expecting causing the thief to
stop in her tracks when - CLINK A portion of the fire

escape breaks and sends Dick falling

WHAAAAAAAM —- he lands on a parked car the windows exploding
outward

For a moment Barbara just feels his face overjoyed that
he’s alright

DICK
(just a whisper)

reach

BARBARA
It’s done Dick

Dick pulls the IV out of his arm and tries to get up

BARBARA
God damn it Nurse

Dick struggles to sit up but doesn’t have the strength

BARBARA
Think about your daughter Think
about what you almost gave up

DICK
No

BARBARA
Don’t fight it Dick

NURSE 1

Dick stops He looks around the room at the numerous crayon
drawings taped to the wall and spots a photograph of his
daughter now much older
A tear slips from Barbara’s eye
BARBARA
Youve been in this bed two years
six months and three days

Dick collapses his mind whirling

Aquaman scowls at a crowd of photographers snapping his

AQUAMAN
Relax Barry We‘ve all got more

himself among all his fans

The crowd ROARS with applause at the sight of Superman flying
overhead He descends to the track

SUPERMAN
Let’s get this over with

‘Bout time

Superman and Flash step up to the starting line A Race
Official raises a STARTING PISTOL in the air The Flash

dozen high-speed cameras come to life as the Official pulls

Time seems to stop
A BLUR OF RED AND BLUE tear around the track The smoke

hasn’t even cleared the barrel of the gun before they cross
the finish line - way too fast to see with the human eye

At a second glance the high-speed cameras reveal both men
shoulder to shoulder trading the lead with every step
Frame by frame they get closer to the string and we

INT HOSPITAL —- DAY

Dick stares out the window while Barbara tapes yet another
drawing to the wall - a picture of a little girl on a swing
The hospital TV flickers in the corner

BARBARA
Last month she got her hands on a
toy stethoscope This of course
meant that if you needed a band-
aid you’d have to steal one from
Brown Bear But once the swing set
went in well so much for having
a doctor in the family I swear
the way she jumps around she’s
your daughter alright

Barbara sits beside him curling her fingers around his

BARBARA
She wants to know why she can’t
come visit you It’s been weeks
Dick You’re not listening to your
doctors you’re hardly eating I

Dick pulls his hand away from hers and grabs the TV remote
He turns up the volume Barbara gets up and heads for the
door

BARBARA
Most women would’ve moved on
Don’t give me a reason to now

She exits

NEWSCASTER

In response the US Secretary of
Defense issued a statement
reaffirming the President’s
position citing that any
subterranean exercises without US

DICK

DICK
I did NOT steal those files

O’ HARA
Oh right Selina did

DICK
Probably three crooks in the world

OHARA

DICK
Didn’t need to

O’Hara spots a stubby MEXICAN WOMAN mopping in the corner

O’ HARA

While it’s clearly not her name she turns startled O’Hara
exchanges a look with Dick Too angry for words Dick gets
his crutches in order and heads for the door

OHARA

Don’t move--

WHACK She knees him in the stomach

Selina pulls off her earring straddles his arm and
instantly picks the lock She steps toward the door when
Dick grabs her by the ankle The exchange continues each
dishing out blows at an alarming speed until finally Dick
slams her against the wall It’s then she realizes

SELINA
Dick

DICK
Nice wig

SELINA
Oh my god Dick that night on
the roof - I never meant for you to
get hurt

DICK
Explain that to the cops

He pulls down on a FIRE ALARM A siren bellows

SELINA
God damn it

She pulls him into a bathroom stall as a PAIR OF COPS enter
the room

COP 1
Let’s go everybody out
IN THE STALL
They lower their voices to a whisper

SELINA
What do you want

DICK
I wanna know what you were doing
that night

SELINA
Same as you - looking for answers

DICK
Then show me what you found

A COP kicks in the stall door to find--

Selina and Dick in an impassioned embrace her top pulled
down her chest pressed against his

COP
I said let’s go Outside

She fixes her blouse

SELINA
He’s relentless

EXT MUSEUM - NIGHT

Selina and Dick walk arm in arm down the museum steps past a
gathering of police cars and fire trucks

SELINA
I’ve been casing this exhibit for
months If they find my gear
they’1l up and ship those diamonds
to Metropolis

DICK
Gee I‘1ll feel real lousy about
that

EXT TENEMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT

Selina pulls the wig from her head letting her long black
hair unfurl They walk toward a rundown apartment complex in
a bad part of town A few locals eye them as they pass

SELINA
Relax

DICK
Do I look worried

SELINA
Most of the time

DICK
Just curious You don’t exactly
blend in

SELINA
I keep to myself
TWO THUGS lean out from an alley and block their way

THUG
Pretty necklace-

WHACK - WHACK - she lays them both out
SELINA
--for the most part
INT TENEMENT BUILDING

Deep shadows run the length of the hall obscuring most of
the graffiti

SELINA
How’s Barbara

DICK
Fine

SELINA
I hear she made a full recovery

DICK
Not full
SELINA
I can’t imagine Tell her I said
hello
DICK
Sure “Honey how was your day

Catwoman says hello”

They round a corner and approach an apartment door She
slides a board aside and reaches in pushing a release The
door opens opposite its hinges

INSIDE HER HIDEAWAY

The room is filled with drills grappling hooks glass-
cutters everything a professional thief could ever want

DICK
Looks like you’re keeping busy

Selina struts across the room and retrieves a file

SELINA
Here First forty-eight hours of
the investigation

DICK
Anything stand out

Selina pulls off her coat and sinks into a comfy chair

SELINA

I’m the thief You’re the
detective

(reflecting)
I loved him you know He pulled
me off the streets right out of
the gutter I owe Bruce
everything

DICK
(sarcastic)
Yeah well I’m sure you made him
real proud

Dick makes for the door

SELINA
There’s something else

Her tone has changed her eyes saddled with guilt

SELINA
I don’t usually do breakouts but
at that price

DICK
Who did you break out

SELINA
I was in over my head with other

debts that had to get paid

DICK
WHO

CUT TO

INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Nothing moves down here Until

A DRILL whirls through a sewage pipe It cuts a wide circle
spilling excrement Lifting from the filth is CATWOMAN

Steam rises from her wet suit her face completely covered by
a protective mask with re-breather We are in

INT ARKHAM ASYLUM - MAIN PRISON

Polished black loafers walk down the hall Selina now wears
a prison security outfit

She enters the SECURITY BOOTH and incapacitates the guards
Her attention turns to the main control panel She runs her

finger down a line of numbered switches stopping at 42
With the push of a button

ELSEWHERE IN THE PRISON
Cell door 42 unlocks and creaks open

BACK TO

INT SELINA’S APARTMENT

SELINA
I tried to look at it like any
other job but-

Dick pushes over a table full of gear angry beyond words
Selina hangs her head in shame

DICK
How much were you paid

SELINA
Twelve up front

DICK

Twelve million
(she nods “yes”)
Who was your contact

SELINA
I don’t know

DICK
What do you mean you don’t know

SELINA
The whole thing was odd Even the
breakout When I got to his cell
it was like he had no idea I was
coming

DICK
How was it arranged

SELINA
It was all done in code Want ads

Gotham Times

Dick takes off his coat and grabs a newspaper off the floor

DICK
Show me

INT GRAYSON HOUSE - 310 AM
Dick enters his house with the file tucked under his arm

BARBARA (0S)
Are those O’Hara’s files

He turns to see Barbara sitting at the dining room table
Judging by her expression she’s been waiting here all night

DICK
Yes

BARBARA
How did you find her

DICK
That’s what I do

BARBARA
Not anymore

DICK
Listen I need to do this

BARBARA
I loved him too Dick But nothing
you do is gonna bring him back

DICK
Then what’s the harm If what they
say is true then-

BARBARA
Every minute you work on this case
you put our daughter’s life further
at risk

DICK
And if we don’t know the truth how
much less is she at risk

BARBARA
Oh don’t give me that bullshit
about fighting for what’s right
Who do you think you’re talking to

DICK
What do you expect me to do just
walk away

BARBARA
Yes and you better Learning the
truth about Bruce’s death won’t
make the world a better place for
our daughter if it gets her father

killed in the process

She marches past him and up the stairs

IN THE STUDY

Dick turns the light on at his desk and opens the file He
stares at it for only a second before closing it

IN THEIR BEDROOM

Dick crawls in bed and puts his arms around his wife

DISSOLVE TO

INT GRAYSON HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

Sun peeks through the curtains Barbara awakens to discover
that her bed is empty

DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

Dick does pull-ups

MONTAGE

-Dick visits the crime scene taking pictures
-Dick works out with rusted weights

-Barbara watches as Dick goes over the case files

-Dick jogs in the rain He’s clearly getting fit

EXT GRAYSON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Dick returns home from his jog to find OHara’s car parked
out front

INSIDE

Barbara shares coffee with O’Hara in the living room

O’ HARA
Dick

DICK
Don’t let me interrupt

Dick heads for the kitchen Barbara doesn’t hold back

BARBARA
Have you been to the crime scene

DICK
It’s not a crime scene anymore

it’s just an alley More coffee

Dick exits the living room and storms into
44

THE KITCHEN
Barbara follows in after him Her voice hushed

BARBARA
That was rude

DICK
That was me being nice

BARBARA
What’s gotten into you He’s here
because he cares

DICK
That’s endearing

BARBARA
Don’t think I don’t know what
youre doing The running every
morning that rusted old weight
bench it’s like you’re training
for a war

OHARA (0S)

I appreciate the hospitality but I

really should get going
Dick empties the coffee pot into the sink

DICK

Just as well we were out of coffee

anyway
Barbara storms out of the kitchen Dick listens as she
apologizes to O’Hara and he opts for a different approach

IN THE FOYER

O’Hara has one foot out the door when

DICK
What’s the rush

Dick closes the door and steers O’Hara into the living room

DICK
Sit down have a second cup

OHARA
I really don’t have the time--

DICK
Make the time

They lock eyes O’Hara reluctantly takes a seat Dick hands
Barbara a coffee cup and she heads back into the kitchen

O’ HARA
You’ve got two minutes

DICK
You need to tell me what you know

O’ HARA
About

DICK
That night in the alley Tell me
what you saw

OHARA
I thought I made myself perfectly
clear

DICK

I need to hear it from you

O’ HARA
I am the Commissioner of Gotham and
you are a stay-at-home dad
DICK
You have access to every source of
information--

OHARA
Information not privy to people
outside of the department

Dick pounds his fist against the table

DICK
God damn it tell me

Barbara reenters the living room - is everything alright

O’Hara calms her with a wave and she goes back into the
He swallows his pride and sits up in his seat

kitchen

O’ HARA
I arrived in the alley at 1137 PM
We found strands of green hair on
the roof as well as on the victim’s
body Three days later we caught
the Joker whose DNA matched the
hair found at the crime scene and
who later confessed to the crime

DICK
He claims to have shot Batman in
the chest and watched him fall off
the roof landing and I quote
“Flat on his back like a wingless
bat”

O’ HARA
And

DICK
And the autopsy report says he
shattered both ankles

O’ HARA
So
47

DICK
So he didn’t land on his back he
landed feet first and fell forward
accounting for the contusion to his
skull

CUT TO

INT ALLEY - NIGHT

WHAM - Batman meets with the pavement shattering his ankles
and cracking his skull

BACK TO

INT GRAYSON HOUSE

OHARA
I don’t give a shit what he says

DICK
Good because his confession is
nothing but a ploy to gain him
status at the asylum

O’ HARA
Forensics can put the Joker on the
roof at the time of the murder
And if that’s not enough the gun
used to commit the crime was the
same make and model he used to
shoot your wife

CUT TO

INT BARBARA’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR

The Joker levels his gun at Barbara’s abdomen and pulls back
on the trigger - BANG

BACK TO
INT GRAYSON HOUSE
DICK
How do you account for the powder
burns on his chest
OHARA
The gun was fired point-blank
DICK
Right except Bruce would never
allow the Joker within arm’s length
of him Never
CUT TO

EXT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT
The barrel of the gun goes off an inch from Batmans chest

BACK TO

INT GRAYSON HOUSE

O’ HARA
We all get old Dick and we all
slip up

DICK

There’s a witness who hears--

O’ HARA
(dismissive)
A drunk in the alley

DICK
He hears a single gunshot followed
by Bruce nearly landing on top of
him But there’s no mention of
hearing any laughter after the
impact

O’ HARA
What does that even mean

DICK
You’ve seen the Joker in his cell
That maniac laughs at everything
He laughs at the god damn walls

O’ HARA
Christ Dick is that all you got

DICK
I’m telling you he didnt pull the
trigger

OHARA

Well a jury disagreed with you
And your two minutes are up

O’Hara stands and heads for the door

DICK
At the very least reopen the case

OHARA
Please thank your wife for the
coffee

DICK

If you reopen the case we can--

O’ HARA

Let it go Dick Your crime-

fighting days are over
OHara exits Barbara comes out of the kitchen with two
fresh cups of coffee She and Dick exchange a look neither
pleased
INT GRAYSON HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
Dick sits at his desk trying to unravel the mystery behind
the want ads and who hired Selina A picture of a PUDDLE OF

BLOOD sends his mind reeling--

FLASHBACK TO

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT
NIGHTWING sends a Batarang whirling - it connects forcing
the gunmans hand up Above a woman overlooking the alley

is hit and killed

BACK TO

Dick shakes the memory from his thoughts and HEARS Bethany
giggling down the hall

UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM

Dick watches from the hall as his wife scrubs Bethany in the
tub

BARBARA
Did you get your elbows

BETHANY
When can we go back to the market

BARBARA
That’s on Thursdays

BETHANY
I wanna buy Daddy some flowers

BARBARA
What color

BETHANY
Red and yellow And orange And
purple

Dick takes it all in considering

BACK AT HIS DESK

The crime scene reports are boxed up and thrown in the
closet

EXT GRAYSON HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Bethany plays on a swing set

BETHANY
Dad watch this

Dick breaks from raking the leaves to watch his daughter hang
from her legs Barbara gazes from

THE KITCHEN WINDOW

She smiles at the sight of her husband and daughter playing
Before she finishes making lunch the doorbell rings

AT THE FRONT DOOR

Barbara is greeted by

BARBARA
Alfred

She bends down to his wheelchair and gives him a hug

ALFRED
How good to see you Miss Barbara

BARBARA
What brings you out this way

INT GRAYSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Alfred sets a KEY on the table in front of Dick Barbara
sits next to him

ALFRED
Master Bruce wanted you to have
this He expressed a hope that you
would continue to donate a portion
of his earnings to the charities he
supported However it is entirely
up to your discretion Wayne
Enterprises the estate
everything now belongs to you

Dick exchanges a look with Barbara before reaching for the
key As he picks it up her hand comes down on top of his

BARBARA
We don’t want it

DICK ALFRED
What

BARBARA
We don’t need this A garage full
of cars a stable full of horses -
you can’t even ride a horse

DICK
Barb
BARBARA
Besides I have a good job and
were paying down your medical
bills-

DICK
Bethany’s college fund what about
that We dipped into that account
to keep up the mortgage

BARBARA
I know

DICK
Where’s that money gonna come from

BARBARA
She’1ll have to work towards a
scholarship

DICK
Barb by this time tomorrow we
could afford to have your back
looked at by the best doctors in
the country

BARBARA
Give the money to Clark

DICK
Clark

BARBARA
He’1l do something good with it

DICK
Clark turned his back on us a long
time ago

BARBARA
I don’t care I don’t want it

ALFRED
Please please

Alfred takes hold of Barbara’s hand

ALFRED

Miss Barbara with all due respect
this inheritance is not meant for
Clark Kent

(to Dick)
And you you should know that
despite their falling out Master
Bruce held Mr Kent in high regard
And rightfully so when you
consider the complexity of his
obligations It’s not every man
who can handle the weight of the
world on his shoulders

DICK
No offense Alfred but we all have
burdens to carry

ALFRED
Yes and you should be thankful you
are not required to carry his

CUT TO
Polished RED BOOTS walk across a field of HUMAN BONES We
are in
EXT AFRICA - THE CONGO - DAY
The boots belong to SUPERMAN who wanders through a valley
LITTERED WITH CORPSES An emptiness consumes his eyes as if
he’s walked through a thousand of these fields When
A blood-curdling SCREAM spins Superman on his heels There

springing from the tree line is a WOMAN COVERED IN BLOOD
her dark skin lacquered red

GUNSHOTS ring out and a bullet tears into her shoulder
sending her headlong into Superman’s arms He pivots to
protect her as more gunfire erupts from the brush the
bullets ricocheting off his back - not that it will matter
The woman’s last breath trickles from her lungs

Superman gently sets her down and turns to face the culprits
A dozen machine guns blaze from the safety of the trees

The Man of Steel lifts back his arms and CLAPS HIS HANDS A
SONIC BOOM fills the air and a SHOCK WAVE shakes the jungle

An eight-year-old BOY stumbles from the tree line He drops
his rifle and falls to the ground his ears bleeding
Superman watches in horror as a dozen other gunmen topple out
from hiding all of them children

INT WAYNE MANOR - DAY

The front door opens and Dick steps inside Sheets cover
everything He makes his way to the library and reaches for
a book on the shelf When pulled a portion of the floor
slides back - revealing a HIDDEN STAIRWELL

Descending through darkened hallways he enters

THE BATCAVE

With his first step Dick sinks into a foot of water A
portion of the cave is flooded He continues farther into
the cavern His fingers follow the contours of one ina
series of ten Batmobiles all gathering dust Relics of the
past consume every corner a giant Joker card an oversized
penny a rack of umbrellas

And thats when he sees it - the ROBIN COSTUME hanging ina
glass display case

ALFRED (0S)
A bit colorful I admit

Dick turns to see Alfred sitting in a motorized wheelchair at
the far end of the cave

ALFRED
Still a fine suit of armor

Alfred wheels himself over to a tool bench and continues his
work re-wiring some sort of handheld electronic GIZMO

DICK
Haven’t you ever heard of pinochle

ALFRED
Ha that’s a game best played with
friends These days I’m very much
alone However I do enjoy
tinkering with these things Helps
keep the mind sharp

DICK
What’s this one do

ALFRED

Oh just another toy Similar in
function to an EMP only
instead of emitting a frequency
that overloads circuitry it
radiates a subsonic modulation that
can rupture steel

(off Dick’s look)
Ha ha I forget You never had a
love for science No your area of
expertise was in leaping off
heights with never a care as to
where you might land Always the
acrobat eh Master Dick

DICK
In my youth Alfred In my youth

Dick spots a table overrun with UTILITY BELTS
57

DICK
Did you ever get around to putting
those audio devices into the belts
like Bruce always talked about

ALFRED
Oh yes Several versions in fact

DICK
Would he have had one on him that
night

ALFRED

I would assume so

Alfred wheels closer to the table grabs a belt and
disconnects a MICRO PROCESSOR from the back

He tosses

ALFRED
Should look something like this

it to Dick It’s no bigger than a dime
ALFRED

Of course you’ll need to retrieve
the right belt

DICK
It can’t really be that easy can
it

ALFRED

Hmff£f nothing ever is

Alfred wheels himself to the cave elevator

ALFRED
It’s good to have you home sir
Now if you’ll excuse me I’1ll leave
the two of you alone

DICK
Wait what

The elevator door closes Dick looks around There’s no one
else in the cave That’s when he notices

A blinking RED LIGHT

Dick steps closer He brushes away the cobwebs and lays his
hand on a scanner There’s a CLUNK as power floods into a
hulking machine - this is the BAT COMPUTER

Dick removes the KEY given to him by Alfred its distinct
shape matches a tumbler on the Bat computer He slides the
key into the console and gives it a twist not expecting to
hear

BRUCE WAYNE (VO)
Hello Dick If youre listening
to this it means Im dead

The sound of Bruce’s voice echoes through the cave

BRUCE WAYNE (VO)
Let me start by saying that the day
you left I was filled with such
relief Just to know that you
would get the chance to live a
normal life I know you feel
guilty for having gone but it
takes courage to begin again and
for that I’ve never been more
proud of you

A VAULT automatically unlocks across the room

BRUCE WAYNE (VO)

This vault the one you always
wanted to see the inside of asa
boy well I’m afraid it’s not
filled with any of those exciting
things you once imagined Inside
it is paperwork - the documentation
you’ll need to bring all of this
the house the stocks my entire

worth into your name
(MORE )

BRUCE WAYNE (VO) (contd)
As for Bruce Wayne well for now
he’s very much alive You’ll even
hear accounts of him popping up
from time to time In fact he’ll
live for several more years until
he tragically dies in a plane crash
North of the Himalayas A fitting
death for a billionaire I suppose
All that I do ask is that you
continue with my contributions to
the companies in this city that are
still out to do good They’re
listed on the second shelf red
folder

A RED FOLDER sits in the vault

BRUCE WAYNE (VO)
And while I know I don’t need to
say this it was an honor to have
fought beside you You’re a smart
detective an honest man and a
great son

of thirty monitors Two SECURITY GUARDS take notice

SECURITY GUARD 1
What’s Darrel doing

DARREL (0S)
You say somethin’

The guards turn to see DARREL THE JANITOR wheel his cart into
the room
AT THE RIDDLER’S CELL
Dick holds the personals against the glass
RIDDLER
Hmm not a very clever code
that’s for sure

AN ALARM bellows Dick panics

DICK
Who placed these ads

RIDDLER
And why would a janitor care to
know

DICK

Can you read the code or can’t you

RIDDLER
The coveralls fit you a bit tight
and bear a softer yellow embroidery
in the patch - a subtle distinction
from the new uniforms though an
adequate disguise nonetheless

DICK
You can’t read the code

RIDDLER
Youre left-handed far-sighted
and your accent makes it apparent
that you are not originally from
this city Yet here you are
determined to uncover the truth
about Gotham’s greatest champion
with a fire in your eye as though
you knew him personally
DICK
You’re wasting my time

RIDDLER
Oh come now DICK GRAYSON what’s
the rush

A pack of SECURITY GUARDS can be heard racing down the
adjacent hallway Dick turns to leave when

RIDDLER
What was the payout

DICK
Twelve million

RIDDLER
Ah therein lies your answer

DICK
I don’t understand

RIDDLER
Look about and sniff around it’s
someone rich within this town

DICK
No riddles

RIDDLER
For he who spends and pays out
millions has himself some extra
billions

The door to the hallway opens and EIGHT SECURITY GUARDS
enter guns out and pointed

SECURITY GUARD
STEP AWAY FROM THE GLASS AND GET
DOWN ON THE GROUND DO IT NOW

74

Dick steps away from the glass and raises his hands above his
head his back facing the guards to keep them from getting a
look at his face

SECURITY GUARD
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES

Dick does as ordered Two security officers try to push him
to his chest but Dick counters disabling both men

Another guard aims a STUN GUN--
Dick swipes his legs out from underneath him The stun gun
fires its electrodes and clamps onto ONE OF THE CELL DOORS
setting off an array of sparks

Another officer aims a shotgun but Dick pushes it up--

BANG - it fractures an overhead pipe adding a DOWNPOUR to
the frenzy Dick works his way through the guards one by
one laying them all out He rounds the hall only to see--

MORE GUARDS arriving in riot gear

Dick heads back the way he came grabs the shotgun off the
floor empties three rounds into a wire-mesh window and DIVES
THROUGH IT Landing

OUT ON THE ROOF

He tumbles across the tiles and rolls over the ledge
Luckily he grabs the gutter and keeps from taking the fatal

plunge He pulls himself up on the roof only to see--

Security guards at the window They don’t waste time with a
warning and open fire - BANG - BANG - BANG

Dick drops back down only the gutter breaks and sends him
swinging into the wall He falls to the lower roof and rolls

to the ground

Out come the dogs - TWO DOBERMANS running full steam

Dick gets up and heads for the police bus the dogs snapping
at his heels He pushes through the passenger door and makes
a quick exit out the driver’s door trapping the dogs in the
vehicle

He scales the perimeter fence and throws himself over the
barbed wire But he’s not out of it yet There’s a second
fence He starts climbing as--

A security guard steps out on a guard tower He loads a
SNIPER RIFLE and takes aim

Dick clears the second fence when--

BANG - a bullet tears through his shoulder and he collapses
to the ground Three POLICE CARS skid to a stop in front of
him Dick hangs his head in defeat The cops rush in and
twist his arms behind his back Before he can muster a
scream the butt of a rifle knocks him cold and his MEMORIES
flash before us

8) The Robin costume is sealed in a glass case and hung in
the Batcave

fireplace Barbara wraps her arms around him She’s
confined to a WHEELCHAIR

11) BANG Batman is shot in the chest

over him

A Xerox machine copies Bethany’s picture adding to a stack
of leaflets already printed Dick sits with his shirt
unbuttoned and two DOCTORS checking his vitals He’s
sweating uncontrollably

DICK
I need to get out of here

DOCTOR 1
Sit still Mr Grayson the police
are doing everything they can

DICK
I’m telling you I can find him

DOCTOR 2
Whatever was in that needle is
sending your heart rate through the
roof

A third doctor joins them

DOCTOR 3
The Toxicology report says it’s
something called Bolinium

DOCTOR 2
Never heard of it Is that like a-

DICK
It’s a neurotoxin

Dick stands and buttons his shirt

DOCTOR 2
Mr Grayson please sit down

the beginning We need to get you

blood and administer a vaccine

DICK
You won’t find one Not around
here

DOCTOR 1

speed the toxin through your body
faster

DICK
Then I guess I better get going

A heavyset cop RUSS DAWSON gets in Dick’s way
RUSS

Get some coffee and have a seat
‘cause you’re not going anywhere

Russ puts his hand on his nightstick Dick wipes the sweat
from his eyes and contemplates what it’1l take to put Russ
down when Gordon enters the room and pulls him aside

GORDON
I’ve made calls to everybody from
the East River to Cathedral Square
nobody’s seen or heard nothin’ If
the Joker’s still in Gotham he’s

battery It beeps to life and pinpoints the Joker’s
location

BACK TO

INT POLICE STATION - SAME

GORDON
(astonished)
There’s a tracer on the Joker

DICK
It’s implanted just below his rib
cage

GORDON
When

DICK

Years ago after Barbara was shot
Bruce was determined to make sure
the Joker would never hurt anyone
again With the tracer inside him
the minute he goes loose Bruce is
there

Gordon is floored A tracer implanted in the Joker

Barbara exits from a room full of investigators her face
swollen from crying She locks eyes with Dick and
approaches

SLAP - her hand comes across his face She tries to hit him
again but the cops intervene

BARBARA
You bastard

She goes hysterical crying and screaming It takes three
men to restrain her They usher her into another room and
close the door

The commotion draws O’Hara into the room Dick lunges at
him He only gets a hand on O’Hara’s shoulder before a swarm
of cops tackle him against the nearest desk

DICK
You did this First Batman--

O’ HARA
Get him out of here

DICK
AND NOW MY DAUGHTER

O’ HARA
Put him somewhere to cool off

Russ and three other officers drag Dick down the hall

DOWN THE HALL - JAIL CELL

Dick is thrown into a cell the door locked shut He stares
back at the men who put him there his chest heaving

RUSS
Let me get you that coffee

The cops head back the way they came chatting among
themselves

COP 1
You alright

RUSS
Yeah he clipped me good though

COP 2
You see that motorcycle of his we
impounded

COP 3
Yeah it’s hard to believe that
guy’s Robin

RUSS
I’ll say he didn’t put up much of
a fight

Russ feels his pockets - something’s missing He races back
down the hall and rounds the corner to see Dick’s jail cell
open his KEYS in the door

INT POLICE STATION - ROOF - NIGHT

A POLICE HELICOPTER touches down on a landing pad Dick
kicks the pilot from his seat and takes the controls

Gordon O’Hara and an army of cops race out onto the roof and
watch as the helicopter takes flight

Russ pulls his sidearm and opens fire--

GORDON
Stop

Gordon barrels into Russ however not before he gets off a
clean shot and punctures the fuselage - the chopper now
leaking gas

GORDON
What the hell is wrong with you
guys

OHara turns to the nearest officer

OHARA
Put out a warrant for Dick
Grayson’s arrest and get a SWAT
team over to Wayne Manor

GORDON
What are you doing

OHARA
(ignoring Gordon)
Contact every precinct south of the
river and get their pilots
airborne They should have ample
time to secure the area and
prohibit him from landing

The officer hurries off to carry out the order
GORDON
For god’s sake you’re gonna get

Dick killed

OHARA
GET HIM OUT OF HERE

GORDON
Oh I’1ll leave

Gordon unclasps his revolver hands it to another officer
and WHACK - punches O’Hara

INT HALL OF JUSTICE - UNDERGROUND WAREHOUSE

Aquaman and Dick enter the warehouse filled with old Batman
equipment and approach THE SLED - a thin rocket-shaped pod
resting on a track

Let’s hope there’s power

Dick brushes away the cobwebs and pushes a button but it
doesn’t power up

AQUAMAN
Nothin’

DICK
I can run a patch
(to the Batmobile)
Atomic batteries to power

The classic ‘66 BATMOBILE registers his VOICE COMMAND and the
engine revs to life Dick pops the hood and runs a cable
from the motor to the sled console

DICK

Aquaman flicks a switch and the sled hums with power Dick
opens the cockpit and shakes Aquaman’s hand

DICK

him cold

His body starts to twitch the poison taking effect

DICK
Don’t make me hurt you

KRACK - the Flash wallops him again

FLASH
There it is that attitude

Dick crawls toward the pod his nose bleeding

FLASH
Bruce had the same thing always
made me want to set the record
straight - show you what it means
to have real power

Dick tries to fight back but he’s no match The Flash
pummels him to the ground

FLASH
So much for that attitude eh

What the Flash doesnt realize is--

Dick has lead him around to the tail of the BATMOBILE
Through swollen lips he utters

DICK
Turbines to speed

The Batmobile’s engine ignites engulfing the Flash in
FLAMES

step the floor gives way dropping him into--

Wicked traps line the hall Robin makes his way through a
sinister maze dodging darts and ducking axes The traps
keep coming including blow torches bullets and a twelve-ton

EIGHT BALL that comes rolling toward him

Robin survives it all and ends up falling into a--

The lid to the tank seals shut imprisoning Robin in an
underwater tomb The enclosure’s made of solid steel with
no other points of entry Robin’s only hope

The electronic GIZMO He pulls it off his belt and activates
the trigger

The metal tank TEARS DOWN THE MIDDLE spilling thousands of
gallons of water into the basement and Robin along with it
He’s a mess but at least he’s still breathing However

The TRACE implanted in the Joker now sitting on the floor A
message painted in blood is scrawled across the wall it

reads “FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY THE AMAZING GRAYSONS TAKE
FLIGHT LET’S HOPE THIS BABY BIRD CAN FLY HA HA HA”

from the vehicle and throws him to the asphalt

Robin tries to get away but is ensnared by a GLOWING LASSO
Its pulsating hum overwhelms his nervous system paralyzing
his muscles

WONDER WOMAN
Don’t fight it it’1ll only hurt
more

She yanks him by the collar and marches down the street his
feet dangling in the air

to get her back right after I turn
you over to the authorities

knocking the tiara off her head

Freed of her lasso Robin looks to the Beast surprised to
see CATWOMAN at the helm She bulldozes Wonder Woman into a
building knocking the amazon cold

Catwoman hops to the street and helps Robin to his feet

CATWOMAN
You can thank me later

A HAND comes from out of nowhere and grabs Catwoman by the
neck IT’S SUPERMAN He bangs her head against a block of
cement and drops her to the sidewalk

His eyes shift to Robin

Robin musters all his strength and lays into Superman with a
right hook We hear BONES SNAP

another Superman catches the first three and lets the
fourth one continue past

The fourth Batarang cuts through an ELECTRICAL CABLE and
sends the wire swinging down It strikes Superman - erupting
sparks and forcing him to his knees When the fireworks
subside the power’s gone out across five city blocks and
Superman lies in the street smoldering

Robin heads for the Beast Only

Superman recovers He slams his FIST into the cement
cracking it like porcelain The crevice zigzags up the
pavement caving in the street and dropping the Beast into a
gaping fissure Robin rolls to safety and tries to get away
however--

Superman grabs hold of him His fingers curl around the
emblem on Robin’s vest a grip no earthly power could pry
free of when--

WHAAAAAAAAAACK A ghostly GREEN WRECKING BALL wallops into
Superman tearing the “R” clean off Robin’s vest and sending
the Man of Steel into the nearest building

GREEN LANTERN has arrived He eyes Robin as he walks past
him Like a lone sheriff in an old western he marches
across the street ready for a showdown

Gordon squeezes through the crowd and hurries over to Robin

ROBIN
The circus he’s taken her to the

circus
Superman lifts from the rubble

ROBIN
Go

Gordon heads off down the street as the two titans come face
to face

GREEN LANTERN
I see I got your attention

SUPERMAN
And

GREEN LANTERN
And the Joker’s got Dick’s
daughter

SUPERMAN
Do you know how many daughters are
dying around the world right now
You don’t seem too concerned about
them Or is that just my job

GREEN LANTERN
I understand your frustration and
I’m sorry if you ever felt like you
had to go it alone

Superman pushes Green Lantern aside when - ZUMMP - a GREEN
CAGE envelopes him

GREEN LANTERN
but either you get your
priorities in line or I line them
up for you

Superman grabs hold of the bars and bends them with ease

SUPERMAN
Cute

GREEN LANTERN
You don’t want to do this

Green Lantern’s ring shimmers spawning a GREEN CANNON the
barrel aimed straight down at Superman

SUPERMAN
Most days I don’t want to do any
of it

ZIP - Superman is instantly behind him locking Green Lantern
in a CHOKE HOLD

SUPERMAN
--but I still do it

In a panic Green Lantern triggers the cannon - BOOM It
misses Superman but tears through the street The force of
the blast knocks them both through a cement pillar
shattering the foundation of a twenty-story building

Despite the damage Superman maintains his grip around Green
Lantern’s throat When--

WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAM A gargantuan GREEN SLEDGEHAMMER slams into
Superman driving him beneath the pavement

GREEN LANTERN
Go

Robin pushes up to his feet and commandeers a HORSE from a
city policeman

ROBIN
Can’t ride a horse eh

He jumps into the saddle With a swift kick the steed
springs into an all-out sprint Robin rides the horse
through the bustling city-scape leaving behind

SUPERMAN who punches up through the street There’s an
unsettling look in his eye as he wipes the asphalt from his
lips However before he can give chase--

A massive GREEN SNAKE wraps around his wrist As more of it
comes into view we discover

This is no snake It’s a colossal GREEN ELEPHANT - a
fearsome creation of Green Lantern’s ring Pedestrians
scurry for cover as the elephant’s trunk tightens around
Superman’s arm and wields him like a mace flattening cars as
if they were made of tin
INT CIRCUS - SAME

The Joker steps into the center of the ring He drags
Bethany behind him disrupting the show

JOKER
(to Bethany)
Oh how your father just LOVES this
place

The Joker heads for the trapeze as

Gordon enters the tent He scans the crowd and spots the
Joker dragging Bethany to the top of trapeze

GORDON
Oh my god

AT THE TOP OF THE TRAPEZE

The Joker SHOOTS an acrobat at the top of the platform and
sends him falling The audience panics

Gordon climbs the spiraling stairwell Before he can reach
the platform the Joker gives the high bar a push and grabs
Bethany by the back of her shirt

JOKER
On three One - two - six - eight -
HA HA HA THREE

Gordon doesnt make it to the platform in time

GORDON
NOOOOOO

The Joker hurls Bethany toward the high bar Her fingers
outstretch--
But dont grab hold Luckily a BAT CABLE winds around her
leg The other end of the cable ensnares the high bar and
sends her rocking back and forth high above the circus floor

The Joker looks down to see--

ROBIN mid-way up the spiraling staircase He rips off his
mask and calls to his daughter

ROBIN
Hang on

JOKER
THAT’S NOT FUNNY

The Joker leans over the platform and opens fire BANG -
Robin takes a bullet in the thigh BANG - he takes another
in the arm

GORDON
NO

Gordon tackles the Joker They wrestle for the gun--
BANG The gun goes off shattering the high bar The two
halves of the bar swing out wildly causing the Bat cable to
unravel Bethany mere seconds away from falling to her death
Crazed Gordon tightens his grip around the Joker’s throat
GORDON
That bullet was meant for you

THAT BULLET WAS MEANT FOR YOU

Robins face goes white as he makes the realization

INT BATCAVE

Alfred makes an adjustment to the MICRO-PROCESSOR and the Bat
computer commences playback FLASHBACKS follow
EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT
It’s not Chief O’Hara but rather--

GORDON who steps out of the shadows and aims his gun at an
unsuspecting Joker To his disappointment--

BATMAN swings onto the scene Before his cape can even
settle his heel meets with the Joker’s chin The force of
the blow knocks the Joker into a SKYLIGHT He shatters the
glass and falls twenty feet to the floor below

Gordon hurries to the skylight and sees the Joker lying face
down in a pile of debris his leg broken at the knee
Oblivious to the threat looming over him the Joker cackles
like a wounded hyena

JOKER
HA HA HA

Again Gordon raises his gun

BATMAN
Put down the gun

GORDON
This has to end

BATMAN
And it will Just give me the gun

GORDON
NO He’ll just escape again And
when he does more families will be
made to suffer

Images of BARBARA LYING IN A MESS OF BLOOD flash through
Gordon’s mind
GORDON
He needs to pay for all the blood
he’s spilled For all the pain
he’s caused

A church bell strikes the hour

BATMAN
He’1l pay but not like that

GORDON
He needs to die HE NEEDS TO DIE

BATMAN
Jim

Tears cascade down Gordons face and he lowers the gun

GORDON

Batman reaches for the gun when--

A vision of BARBARA LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD flashes through
Gordon’s mind He tenses

BANG

Both Gordon and Batman are equally horrified Batman slips
backwards and falls off the roof Gordon watches from the
ledge as Batman hits the pavement nearly crushing a homeless
man beneath him

Gordon pulls back from the ledge so not to be seen A surge
of fear and anger sweep over him and he hurries to the
skylight only to discover--

The Joker is gone Sirens can be heard in the distance

CUT TO
INT GORDON’S HOUSE

The sink faucet turns on Upon closer look Gordon wasnt
doing the dishes when he got the call about Batmans death -
he was washing the BLOOD from his hands

CUT TO

INT BANK

Dick spots Gordon managing his check book - at a closer look
the top of the check reads GOTHAM SECURITIES

BACK TO

INT CIRCUS

Robin and Gordon lock eyes

GORDON
It was an accident You have to
believe me AN ACCIDENT

The Joker muscles the gun against Gordons chest--

BANG Gordon pulls away from the Joker a circle of red
widening across his shirt His eyes beg for forgiveness as
he steps off the platform and reaches for Bethany

SNAP Her cable gives way--

Gordon dives after her the ground quickly making its way
toward them He catches her and pivots to his back
absorbing the impact

JOKER
HA HA TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE

Gordon and Bethany lie without moving
ROBIN
NO

JOKER
OH YES AND IT’S TIME YOU JOINED
THEM

The Joker aims his gun at Robins face when--

A BAT-SHAPED FIGURE swoops down and knocks the Joker off his
feet No it’s not Batman

It’s BATGIRL Barbara’s dressed in the uniform her hair
spilling out the back She proceeds to beat the Joker
senseless Before she’s through she grabs him by the collar
and leans him over the platform

Lucky for him Bethany lifts her head - she survived the
fall Batgirl opts for cuffing the Joker to the railing and
rappels to the floor She rips off her mask and engulfs
Bethany in a hug

BARBARA
Bethany

Despite his wounds Robin breathes a sigh of relief when
SUPERMAN DRIVES GREEN LANTERN THROUGH THE TENT AND INTO THE
GROUND The trapeze supports rupture sending Robin and the
platform to the floor

The chaos of it all sends the Joker into a laughing craze

JOKER
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

He roars in delirium that is until a trapeze WIRE snaps
loose and--

SHLUNK - severs his head from his neck

When the dust settles Green Lantern lies unconscious
Superman proves the victor though he doesnt look it

Bruises pock his face and nothing is left of his cape In
his hand he holds Green Lantern’s RING which he throws to
the dirt and steps toward Robin

Beaten beyond all measure Robin lies on the ground
incapable of moving Barbara comes to his defense however
Superman SLAPS her to the floor

BETHANY
No

Bethany gets between her father and Superman

BETHANY
Please Stop Pleeeeease

Superman pushes past her and grabs Robin by the throat He
lifts him off his feet his eyes gleaming red when--

Bethany wraps her arms around Superman’s leg and lets out a
bloodcurdling scream

BETHANY
SOMEBODY HEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP

Her voice echoes throughout the tent and awakens Superman
from his frenzied state His eyes return to their blue
luster before welling up with tears What’s left of the
crowd watches in silence as Superman sets Robin on the floor
and slumps down beside him

The two men sit without speaking

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

In the shadow of Batman’s monument sits a conservative
headstone It bears the name JAMES GORDON Dick replaces
the wilted flowers with a fresh bundle and stands alone at
the grave his wounds nearly healed He nods respectfully
and heads for his car
INT GRAYSON HOUSE - DAY

Dick pulls into the driveway and parks He walks up the
stoop however before he has the chance to open the front
door a car pulls up to the curb Smiling in the backseat
is

BETHANY
Daddy

Bethany races out of the car and tackles him with a hug

BETHANY
I missed you

DICK
I missed you too

BETHANY
And mommy

Dick looks to the car and sees Barbara standing beside it
Their stare speaks volumes

DICK
And mommy

BETHANY
Does that mean we can come back
home

DICK
I don’t know I moved someone
else into your room

BETHANY
You what

DICK
Maybe the two of you can share
it
BETHANY
Share it With who

Dick opens the front door giving way to a PUPPY It races
over to Bethany and licks her face wildly

INT GRAYSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Barbara and Dick clean up after supper while Bethany plays
with the dog on the living room floor the TV glowing in the
background

BARBARA
I almost forgot how well you cook

Barbara goes in for a slow kiss

BARBARA
Mmmmm spicy

BETHANY (0S)
Daddy look I made him roll over

Dick exits the kitchen and gives Bethany an audience

DICK
Let me see

Bethany tries to command the puppy while her father watches
when something on the TV catches his eye

It’s an emergency news bulletin The reporter runs for cover
as a gray BEAST OF A MAN tears apart the city His
abnormally large fists pummel cars and buckle the pavement
Beneath an open-faced helmet his red eyes emit a pulsating
laser that lays waste to everything caught in its fury This
is DARKSEID an alien invader hellbent on destruction

SUPERMAN attempts to restrain him but fails

Dick watches from the comfort of his living room as Darkseid
bares down on Superman and--
CLICK Barbara shuts off the TV with the remote
Dick looks at her his eyes wide his blood pumping through
his veins She stares back at him her head titled as if to
say “I thought we settled this”
Oblivious Bethany chimes in
BETHANY
(regarding the dog)

He did it Did you see it Dad

DICK
Umm

BETHANY
Did you see him roll over

Dick exhales a cleansing breath and sits down on the couch

DICK
Show me again honey

Bethany attempts to train the dog while her father watches
He offers a few suggestions his attention focussed as best

he can when Barbara leans closer and whispers in his ear

BARBARA
What are you waiting for

Dick looks at her in shock

BARBARA
He’s gonna need your help

CUT TO

EXT CITY - NIGHT

Superman and Darkseid tangle like a pair of feuding gods
reducing the city to ash
Things go from bad to worse when GREEN LANTERN and WONDER
WOMAN join the fight and are quickly subdued

Darkseid appears unstoppable He envelopes Superman in a
laser blast that sears off his trademark curl and brings him
to his knees Superman screams in pain the laser
overpowering his senses when--

KA-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM The BATMOBILE barrels into Darkseid

The awe-inspiring car screeches to a stop and a hatch swings
open Dick steps out of the driver seat only he’s not
dressed as Robin

He is now the new BATMAN

SUPERMAN
He’s too strong Dick Get clear
or you’re gonna get yourself
killed

BATMAN
I don’t know what you’re talking
about I’m just out for a drive

SUPERMAN
This is no time for jokes Get out
of here

BATMAN

Fine I guess you don’t need to
know his weakness

Batman turns to leave

SUPERMAN
What weakness

Darkseid gets to his feet knocking over a pair of fire
trucks in the process
BATMAN
No no you’ve got this You’re
right he’s strong Keen detective
work there

SUPERMAN
All right

Batman stops and glares over his shoulder

SUPERMAN
We work together

Batman lets the words hang in the air before turning back
around and stepping up to Superman

BATMAN
Together

Darkseid ROARS with the force of a thousand lions as our two
heroes ready for a fight

THE END
