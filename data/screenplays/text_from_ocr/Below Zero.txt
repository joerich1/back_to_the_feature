EXT OCEAN - DAY
SUPER Ross Sea off the coast of Antarctica

We fly in from high above to a faint speck on the ocean
surface dwarfed by the vast whiteness of the coast of
Antarctica in the background

As we draw nearer the speck becomes visible as a ship a
research vessel with instrumentation and radar equipment on
the top and sides

INT USS ENDEAVOURBRIDGE - DAY

On the dimly lit bridge two men are hunched over a computer
screen The screen illuminates their faces in an eerie green
glow

CAPTAIN DUNLEAVY is a middle aged officer with a potbelly
and suntanned weathered face He looks tired His first
officer CHIEF PHILLIPS is a young lean tall sailor He is
pale compared to his Captain

CAPTAIN DUNLEAVY
Well that should be just about it
I dont think we can cram any more
data into these damn computers
That should keep the boys at
Langley busy for awhile

Phillips is grinning

CHIEF PHILLIPS
Its going to be nice to be
somewhere where your teeth dont
shatter when you smile outside

Philips takes a more serious tone as he bends over the
instrument panel

PHILLIPS (CONTD)
There is one thing skipper This
anomaly was picked up this morning

Philips points at the monitor

PHILLIPS (CONTD)
Theres a heat signature of unknown
origin that we detectedright
here under Lake Vostok

The Captain looks inquisitively at the radar screen and then
to his First Officer
DUNLEAVY
Under the lake

PHILLIPS
Yes Skipper Thats the real
strange thing The reading is from
nearly two miles down and its
still registering on the telemetry
It must be a very strong source or
our instruments are way way off

Captain Philips sighs takes off his cap and scratches his
head

DUNLEAVY
Great so we may not be going home
after all OK lets call this in
It might--

The Captain is cut off mid-sentence as a violent shudder and
thunderous sound reverberate through the bridge shaking the
ENDEAVOUR violently Everyone on the bridge is surprised many
thrown completely off balance

A mid-shipman falls to his knees and a cup of coffee falls off
a table and smashes to pieces on the bridge deck

The sudden violent movement stops Philips straightens
himself and looks out the Bridge window to see if he can see
if there is anything visible like something ramming the
vessel that might have caused the violent shudder

DUNLEAVY (CONTD)
What the hell was that

PHILLIPS
Sounds like we have a problem with
the engines Skipper

The Captain visibly agitated at Phillips comment and the
situation turns suddenly towards his Executive Officer

DUNLEAVY
Just what we need right now Im
going down to the engine room Ill
have Lopezs ass for this

Phillips leaves to exit the bridge and barks orders to
Dunleavy without turning

DUNLEAVY (CONTD)
You have the Con

INT USS ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - DAY

The engine room is dimly light the emergency lights
flickering on and off Captain Dunleavy enters the engine room
quickly and then stops abruptly He seems puzzled He scans
the room for the engineers on duty He yells into the huge
engine room

DUNLEAVY
Lopez Jones Where the hell are
you

There is no answer and his shouts echo through the metallic
room The Captain walks slowly into the main engine area and
looks down at the floor

The floor is wet The Captain walks slowly through a half
inch of water that covers the floor He bends down and
touches a slimy substance is mixed in with the water He
rubs it between his fingers

DUNLEAVY (CONTD)
What the hell

The Captain looks around the room again

DUNLEAVY (CONTD)
Is there anybody down here This is
the Captain Sound off if anyone is
hurt

The Captain looks over to the main engine block His face
shows deep shock Dunleavy sees the engine is mangled and
destroyed as if a giant hammer was taken to it

Right next to the main engine on the floor is the body of
Lopez the Chief Engineer We do not see the entire corpse
just blood and an outstretched hand

DUNLEAVY (CONTD)
Jesus

The horrified look on Dunleavys face lets us know how bad
Lopez is mutilated Dunleavy begins to look scared as he he
surveys the entire scene of devastation

The Captain turns and runs to the intercom system back near
the entrance to the engine room Dunleavy picks up the hand
set clicks the talk release button and starts to yell into
the vessels comm system

DUNLEAVY
Bridge Bridge Captain Dunleavy
here Emergency main engine room
Send armed--

A loud guttural sound is heard 0S interrupting the
Captains orders Dunleavy has his back to us He stops as
he hears the sound but does not turn to face whatever is
making the noise

NEW ANGLE - FRONT

Dunleavy is holding the com link in his hand not moving We
hear the slow rasping sound that is now coming from behind
the Captain We can not see the source

The Captain sees an emergency axe right next to the
intercom With a sudden movement and no hesitation Dunleavy
quickly breaks the glass with his bare fist Blood streams
down his cut knuckles

He reaches for the ax and grabs it with both hands He pulls
it free Yelling defiantly he turns around to confront
whatever is behind him We rush into his face as he screams

SUPER CIA HEADQUARTERS LANGLEY VIRGINIA
INT CIA HEADQUARTERS LONG HALLWAY

Two men are walking briskly down a long hallway one holding
an open folder in his hand and scanning it as he walks with
the other

The man holding the folder is RYAN MCCALLISTER He is a well
dressed tall distinguished looking man who has the look of
someone used to being in charge

The man trying desperately to keep up with him is BYRON
DANVERS Danvers is McCallisters opposite He is skinny
almost spindly and short He is wearing rumpled clothes and
keeps pushing up the small wire-framed glasses that keep
slipping down his nose

Danvers is speaking animatedly as McCallister is keeping his
eyes on his folder as he walks

DANVERS
You have to understand this is an
emergency
MCCALLISTER
With all due respect Doctor
Danvers I dont see how this is
National Security emergency

Danvers and McCallister burst through two glass doors into
an office The office walls are entirely glass

Through the walls you see computer screens and operators a
Command Center that encircles the office In the office are
two more people a man and a woman

The man is ARCHIBOLD KINCAID and he is a member of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff He is dressed in full Navy uniform
standing ramrod straight next to the the desk of SUSAN
ANDERSON Anderson is the Director of the CIA She is seated
at a large desk reading her head down with reports on her
desk

Anderson does not look up from the file she is reading at
her desk as she addresses McCallister

ANDERSON
This better be good McCallister

MCCALLISTER
I hope so too Director

Anderson finally looks up from her files and we see she is a
mature woman attractive but with a powerful nearly menacing
air She takes off her reading glasses and appraises
McCallister coolly She then looks over Danvers almost
dismissively

McCallister extends his arm towards Danvers

MCCALLISTER (CONTD)
Director this is Doctor Danvers of
our BioGeo Intelligence unit

Anderson is still appraising Danvers

ANDERSON
So this is the cyber geek who
wants us to send a special ops team
to the ass end of nowhere

DANVERS
Director Im sorry to intrude but
as I was explaining to Chief
McCallister this could be very
important for the Agency
Anderson ignoring Danvers looks back intently at McCallister
with a no-nonsense stare

ANDERSON
Explain - briefly

McCallister places a red file in front of Danvers on her
desk Anderson picks it up puts her reading glasses back on
and starts to read McCallister continues the briefing

MCCALLISTER
We lost contact with one of our
research vessels- the ENDEAVOUR-
off the coast of Antarctica Its
mission was to gather research for
our biogeo unit in regards to the
environment possible global
warming etc Nothing politically
sensitive-strictly for Agency use
We were going to use the data to
run threat assessments

Anderson looks up at McCallister over her reading glasses
more interested now

ANDERSON
What kind of threat assessments

MCCALLISTER
Far-fetched stuff even for us
Terrorists purposely melting the
polar ice caps to flood the world
things like that Not feasible but
necessary simulations to run

McCallister looks pointedly at Anderson
MCCALLISTER (CONTD)
We need to cover our asses with the

current Administration

Anderson ignores McCallisters political comment

ANDERSON
How long has ENDEAVOUR been out of
contact

MCCALLISTER

Three days It missed its last two
scheduled check-in times

A map pops up on the screen on the far side of the office
wall What was once see-through glass is now a map of
Antarctica The image is a Mercator projection of the
Southern Hemisphere

McCallister walks over to the the now illuminated screen
points at a small red dot on the map which then zooms in
a point right off the coast of Antarctica

MCCALLISTER (CONTD)
From what we can tell the vessel
is still at its last reported
position But from what we can see
from satellite imaging its dead
in the water It appears they have
no power We currently have no
vessels in the area to attempt a
rescue Too far south Point in
fact we dont even know if they
need rescuing at this point

He
to

Danvers positions himself closer to Andersons desk cutting

off McCallister

DANVERS
But their DATA needs rescuing
Director the information flow all
their telemetry - has also stopped
transmitting as well

Anderson turns in her chair towards Danvers and holds her
head looking impatient

ANDERSON
So

DANVERS
Right before we lost contact the
ENDEAVOUR had radioed that they
found a startling anomaly A heat
source that was not there even
three days ago This source is from
an area more than two miles BELOW
the lake

ANDERSON
And why is that important

Danvers begins to lose his patience fidgeting with his

glasses He tries to explain slowly but condescendingly to

Anderson Anderson does not move as she waits for answer

DANVERS
Director the suddenness of its
appearance means this heat
signature is a major event
possibly a seismic or volcanic
action of enormous magnitude This
could effect the entire hemisphere
possibly the whole of earths
biosphere

’

Anderson looks over at McCallister unimpressed

ANDERSON
What do you think

McCallister hesitates for a minute

MCCALLISTER

I think we should take a look Its
probably nothing ENDEAVOURs power

is probably out thats all Maybe
other technical trouble which is
stopping them from contacting us
But the loss of communication and
this event - its too much of a
coincidence

McCallister looks over to Danvers

MCCALLISTER (CONTD)
And if this is as major a
geological event that Danvers says
it is it might have enormous
ramifications for the entire
region We should probably get
ahead of this one

Anderson picks up another file on her desk

contents

ANDERSON
And I assume Doctor Danvers will
want to get out of his cubicle and
go as a special adviser on this
mission Finally get out into the
field right Doctor It says here
you speak six languages
Impressive But of no use on this
operation

MCCALLISTER
Anderson is our subject matter
expert on this type of thing His
language skills are secondary to

scanning

the
his knowledge of the region He
knows everything about Antarctica

McCallister stalls slightly as if wondering whether to
continue

MCCALLISTER (CONTD)
Its not relevant to this mission
but there was an historical find
made by ENDEAVOUR as well a small
tablet of ancient runes or glyphs -
Danvers tells me - found while
doing their primary research

Anderson nods her head

ANDERSON
I saw the pictures in the file A
new Rosetta Stoneperhaps Is that
what youre thinking Very
interesting stuff but for another
time Right now this is a rescue
mission not an archaeological dig
understood

MCCALLISTER
Danvers knows that Director But he
still is the best intelligence
officer for this job

Anderson looks at Danvers

ANDERSON
Doctor it looks like youve got
your field assignment

She gets up from her desk and walks straight up to Danvers
staring him directly in the face

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Well bookworm I guess youre
going on a little adventure

Anderson addresses Admiral Kincaid without taking her eyes off
Danvers

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Admiral what vessels do you have
in the area

Kincaid moves slightly but remains stoic almost at full
attention
KINCAID
Right now we have war games
underway in the South Atlantic I
might be able to pull one boat
away But we have to act quickly

He walks over to the map and points to Antarctica

KINCAID (CONTD)
A few more weeks and the weather
down there becomes impossible for
any activities rescue or
otherwise Director Id also like
one of my people to accompany your
team ENDEAVOUR is a Navy boat
after all

Kincaid leans over and speaks into an intercom on Andersons
desk

KINCAID (CONTD)
Send in Lieutenant Hartley

The doors to the office open and a tall woman in Navy blues
walks into the center of the room Lieutenant PATRICIA
HARTLEY is a tall athletic type

She is pretty woman with short brown hair and green eyes but
is stern looking as begets her experience as a woman who has
risen to the top in a male-dominated world Hartley stands
at attention

HARTLEY
Sir

KINCAID
At ease Lieutenant This is
Lieutenant Hartley She is a rescue
and salvage expert and has years of
experience in the arctic and cold
weather operations

Anderson nods in approval to Kincaid She turns and walks
back to her desk

DANVERS
One Navy vessel is all youre
getting McCallister Antarctica is
technically not the property or
possession of any country
according to international treaty
I dont want any more US presence
down there than is absolutely
necessary Danvers and his team
will have to get another ride down

Anderson turns her chair around and addresses Admiral Kincaid

DANVERS
Do you know who is the best
civilian Captain available down in
those waters Admiral

Kincaid looks down at the floor dejectedly

KINCAID
Yes maam Yes I do

SUPER TIERRA DEL FUEGO ARGENTINA
EXT LAST STAND BAR - NIGHT

The bar is a grimy sea town dive where sailors prostitutes
and drunks from all over the world get together after they
have been kicked out of every other bar in the southern

hemisphere Its a combination watering hole and hell hole

INT LAST STAND BAR - NIGHT

Danvers and Hartley walk through the old-fashioned swinging
doors one panel barely hanging on and hits Danvers as he
enters They walk into a throng of barflies alcohol and
noise The bar is packed and rowdy

Hartley is dressed in civilian cloths but still conservative
given her military bearing

Danvers is over-dressed with a huge down coat and a hat with
two flaps over the ears giving him the appearance of a
bespectacled Elmer Fudd Danvers screams over the loud music
while looking around the bar

DANVERS
Youve seen his photo from the
file right Do you see him

Hartley scans the bar intently

HARTLEY
No But this is an old photo

Hartley walks up to the bartender pushing several leering

drunks out of the way The bartender checks Hartley out from
head to toe

BARTENDER
Hi honey whats a dump like you
doing in a nice place like this

The bartender grabs his private parts Hartley ignores the
action and screams over the din of the bar

HARTLEY
Im looking for Captain Jenkins
Captain of the AUSTRALIS

BARTENDER
Jenky Hes in the back playing
poker at his usual table You sure
I cant fix you something sweetie

Hartley ignores the bartender and nods to Danvers to follow
her They weave their way around staggering drunks and
staggeringly ugly prostitutes until they arrive at a back
table

The table is occupied by four men They are playing
poker-five card draw- and there is a huge jackpot piled high
in the middle of the table

FIRST SAILOR
I fold - you keep giving me the
shittiest cards Jenky

SECOND SAILOR
Me tooI need to save my money
for these lovely ladies

He kisses one of the women sitting on his lap

THIRD SAILOR
(smiling)
Just you and me now Jenkins

We come full circle around the table to Captain STEVEN
JENKINS

Jenkins is a 40ish well-built man whose black hair is
graying at the temples His blue eyes are cold and sharp
His face would be considered handsome but has seen too many
days on the open sea and too many nights in places like
this

Jenkins addresses the third sailor while looking down at his
hand

JENKINS
Just us

Jenkins checks his hand Hes holding a pair of twos and a
pair of Aces the Dead Mans hand

JENKINS (CONTD)
Youre too good for me BennettI
fold

Jenkins lays his hand down and theres a big roar erupts
from the table and crowd gathered around it The sailor
grins and grabs his pot Jenkins gets up and starts to walk
over to the bar

JENKINS (CONTD)
Ill be back for my money you
pirates Let me just take a piss
and grab another round Youre
paying Bennett

Danvers and Hartley who have been standing behind Jenkins
during the game step in front him

HARTLEY
Captain Jenkins Captain Steven
Jenkins

Jenkins stops staggering a little and stares at Hartley and
Danvers suspiciously

JENKINS
Who wants to know

HARTLEY
Can we talk somewhere

JENKINS
Again who wants to know Who are
you with The IRS has no
jurisdiction down here and I can
prove -

DANVERS
No No Captain nothing like that
We want to talk about giving you
some money

Jenkins face lights up

JENKINS
Well than you are not from the
government which is all I need to
know

Jenkins drunk and with an air of feigned authority walks
over to a corner table He beckons for Hartley and Danvers to
follow

JENKINS (CONTD)
Step into my office

Jenkins grabs two drunks sleeping it off on a table in the
back and tosses them into the corner where they fall ina
heap still passed out

Jenkins waves to the bartender for another whiskey as he
Danvers and Hartley all sit down at the now unoccupied
table Jenkins looks resignedly a Hartley and Danvers

JENKINS (CONTD)
OK so what Id do this time

DANVERS
Do Nothing at all Captain We
actually need your help Admiral
Kincaid sent us

JENKINS
Kincaid Oh ChristI thought you
said you didnt work for the
government

DANVERS
I didnt say that -look it doesnt
matter I work for the CIA and Lt
Hartley is with the Navy

Jenkins winces slightly at Danvers explanation Hartley
becomes noticeable upset about the way Jenkins reaction to the
news

HARTLEY
Is that a problem

Jenkins mutters under his breath

JENKINS
Only for you two

As the bartender delivers the double whiskey Jenkins grabs
him

JENKINS (CONTD)
You two want anything Its on me

Hartley looks at Jenkins with barely concealed contempt

HARTLEY
Were on duty

Danvers looks like he wants to order a drink but the bartender
walks off before he can order Hartley pulls out a file and
starts to read aloud

HARTLEY
You have quite an impressive
early career Captain Jenkins
Special forces Delta Force SAS
training even a stint with Russian
Spetznatz Ex-Navy ex Seal ex-

JENKINS
Yeah yeah I know Ex-everything

Jenkins downs his drink

JENKINS (CONTD)
Im also an ex-ex alcoholic

Jenkins smiles at Hartley who grimaces back sarcastically

HARTLEY
Thats a good one Whod you steal
that line from

Jenkins waves to the bartender for another refill still
smiling at Hartley

JENKINS
My ex-wife

Hartley stops smiling and stares intently at Jenkins

HARTLEY
Why did you fold

Jenkins looks confused by the question

JENKINS
What

HARTLEY
Why did you fold You could have
pulled a flush Was it because you
were holding Aces and Eights the
Dead Mans Hand Are you really
that much of a cliche the
superstitious sailor

Jenkins sits back in his chair no longer smiling
Hartley more intently

JENKINS
If youre really Navy you know all
sailors are superstitious And for
damn good reason

Jenkins gestures broadly around the bar

JENKINS (CONTD)

Id rather pay in here than out on
the water thank you very much And
how do you know I didnt fold
because on the next pot when
theyre all more drunk Ill clean
up Take that stick out of you ass
Lieutenant Sometimes you dont do
things by the book to come out
ahead

Jenkins and Hartley stare each other down Danvers
break the tension by getting back on the subject

DANVERS
Well as I said Captain we need
your help We want to rent your

ship

JENKINS
Boat

DANVERS
Pardon me

JENKINS

You call it a boat not a ship
Its bad luck to call it a ship

DANVERS
Right Well we want to rent your
boat then

JENKINS

Well when next season comes
around Ill see what I can do The
government -and Kincaid -is cheaper
than the whores in this place
Youll probably be last in line

He looks at

tries to

when we head back I go to highest
bidder

Hartley smirks

HARTLEY
No surprise there

Hartley leans over and addresses Jenkins emphatically

HARTLEY
We need your vessel now - not next
season

JENKINS

Nobodys going down to Antarctica
now Its too late in the season
too much can go wrong

HARTLEY
Your rig is an ice-breaker right
Well thats what we need

Jenkins shakes his head as the bartender brings him another
whiskey

JENKINS
You just dont get it do you The
seas are too rough the ice is too
thick -

Danvers quickly cuts off Jenkins

DANVERS
We can pay you 100000 plus expenses plus-

Jenkins slams his glass down on the table and rises out of
his chair yelling across the noise of the bar

JENKINS
Willie Where the hell is Willie

Danvers and Hartley are surprised by Jenkins outburst
WILLIE pops his head out of the throng in front of the bar

He has a gray beard and long gray hair His forearms are
filled with tattoos He has a pipe dangling from his mouth
and large full stein of beer in the other Willie shouts
back over the crowd

WILLIE
Yeah skipper
JENKINS
Round up the boys and meet me back
at the AUSTRALIS Were going out
again Make it quick

Willie looks upset about going back out but does as hes
ordered

WILLIE
OK Skip Anything you say

Willie starts screaming different names as he moves around
the bar collecting the rest of the crew

Hartley looks at Jenkins with amusement and now unconcealed
contempt

HARTLEY
I thought it was too late in the
season

JENKINS

Lady 100K buys you me my boat and
a whole shitload of time

The bartender delivers Jenkins another whiskey He drinks it
in one gulp and then slams the glass on the table

EXT OCEAN -DAY

We follow a huge vessel an Icebreaker as it cuts through
the rough waters of an open sea We catch up with vessel
from behind and we read the name AUSTRALIS on her bow

There is a frenzy of seaman working on the boats decks in
the frigid cold The AUSTRALIS heads south towards
Antarctica

INT AUSTRALIS BRIDGE - EVENING

Captain Jenkins is looking through binoculars as Willie his
Second in command is at the helm Several junior shipmen
are also at various bridge controls Danvers is standing to
the side in his bright orange down parka shivering from the
cold even inside the bridge

Hartley walks onto the Bridge through an open bulkhead door
She is wearing just a long black pullover and does not seem
as susceptible to the cold as Danvers She hands a file to
Danvers

HARTLEY
Here is the latest Intel on the

ENDEAVOUR Still no communication
no telemetry Nothing at all But
we have all our equipment ready
-the two SEALs they provided us
are good Ive worked with them
before

Hartley nods dismissively towards Jenkins

HARTLEY (CONTD)
It looks like we are still a go
with Captain Jenkins for this
operation

DANVERS
OK thanks

Danvers stares at Hartleys toned body through her tight
sweater

DANVERS (CONTD)
Arent you chilly

HARTLEY
(smiling)
Welcome to the cold war

Hartley exits the bridge through the same bulkhead door
Jenkins continues to peer through his binoculars

JENKINS
She doesnt like me very much does
she

Danvers shrugs sheepishly not knowing what to say

JENKINS
For the record I never drink when
Im on the water

Danvers changes the subject

DANVERS
I love the name of your sh
boat The AUSTRALIS From the
Latin Terra Australis -Southern
Land What they used to call
Antarctica thousands of years
before they actually discovered it
Perfect Do you know that theres a
number of scientists who believe
Antarctica was the real location of
Atlantis That it used to be the
capital of an enormous kingdom that
spanned the entire world Well not
mainstream scientists of course

Jenkins turns back towards Jenkins and snickers

JENKINS
Some kingdom Cold and ice for your
loyal subjects You can have it

DANVERS
Oh I dont know Captain All these
myths have some basis in truth
Even from Platos time there have
been stories and folktales in all
of mans writings art about long
lost civilizations From the Bible
to Blake even Lovecraft and
Stephen King They all believed
there was something out there
something ancient and hidden
Something we cant quite put our
finger on Just past the thin veil
of our human senses

Danvers eyes intently at Jenkins who is still peering out

through his binoculars

DANVERS (CONTD)
Wouldnt you like to pierce that
veil Captain To see whats on the
other side so to speak

Jenkins stares at Danvers appraising him truly for
time

JENKINS
I guess you dont get out much do
you Danvers Ive seen plenty
amazing things but all
explainable Nothing mysterious
down here except cold isolation
and death What are you out here
for anyway Danvers Youre not a
field agent

Danvers bristles at the comment He looks agitated

DANVERS
Because its my time Captain Ive
been sitting at a desk in a cubicle
for too long while others live
their lives Live MY life

first

Jenkins turns back and looks into his binoculars scanning the

horizon

JENKINS
(quoting)
They also serve Who only stand
and wait

Danvers seems surprised He looks at the Captain with what

appears to be new found admiration

DANVERS
Milton Well done Captain

Danvers walks over to the Bridge window and points out towards

the horizon

DANVERS (CONTD)
But waiting is all Ive ever done
I want to be out there Captain To
see what youve seen To see things
maybe you have not yet seen And
for myself not reading about them
second hand

Jenkins shakes his head

JENKINS
I guess it takes all kinds
Danvers I hope you get what ever
youre after without getting
yourself -or me -killed in the
process

Jenkins looks at the intelligence folder in Danvers

JENKINS (CONTD)
So ENDEAVOUR is still at the same
coordinates off the Ross Ice Shelf

Danvers looks down at the new Intelligence

DANVERS
Yes same coordinates nothings
changed The plan is the same as we
outlined back in Argentina Meet up
with ENDEAVOUR than rendezvous with
USS COPLEY which is being diverted
from the South Atlantic Then we
proceed to Lake Vostok where the
ENDEAVOUR base camp is set up

hand

Jenkins suddenly looks grim

JENKINS
Vostok No one said anything about
going to Vostok

Danvers appears uninterested

DANVERS
Im sure I mentioned it Is ita
problem Captain

Jenkins ignores Danvers and looks back out to sea

JENKINS
Well hit the bulk of ice pack in
two hours Well be at ENDEAVOUR in
four hours It will be night by the
time we get there so dress warmly

Jenkins glances back at Danvers and smiles
JENKINS (CONTD)
You wanted to be out there Its
your time Danvers Youre coming
aboard

Danvers looks scared

EXT ROSS SEA ANTARCTICA - NIGHT

The AUSTRALIS slowly but powerfully crashes through the ice

The lights of the Australis powerful Kleig lights brightly
illuminate the boat and ice being crushed as the vessel
pummels through the ice pack Everything else is pitch black

INT AUSTRALIS BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Bridge is darkened to help the night vision of the crew
Jenkins is standing above a radar screen Danvers and Hartley
behind him Next to them are two SEAL commandos KINGSLEY and
WARSKI

The SEALs are fierce looking strong men who look capable of
anything They are dressed in the same Navy issue black
cold-weather pullover as Hartley Willie looks up from the
Bridges main radar screen

WILLIE
Skipper we have a solid contact
holding steady at forty degrees
Contact is approximately two
hundred yards out

JENKINS
OK Willie Full stop and bring us
right up asides

WILLIE
No problem Skipper

Willie shouts orders to the crew as his pipe dangles out of
his mouth Jenkins pulls his coat on and opens the bridge
door Danvers Hartley and the two SEALs follow him out

Jenkins peers into the sea as the lights pierce the night The
engines roar gets noticeably lower and the ship begins to
slow The sound of crushing ice slows and then stops as well
Jenkins screams into the bridge through the open door

JENKINS
Hit the Torches

The Bridge and top bow lights blaze on illuminating a vessel
trapped in a sheet of ice The ENDEAVOUR is titled slightly on
her side There are no lights of any kind The vessel appears
to be deserted

ENDEAVOUR looks like a ghost ship Jenkins looks back grimly
at Hartley and Danvers

JENKINS (CONTD)
It guess it wasnt a communications
failure

Hartley turns towards Kingsley and Warski

HARTLEY
Lets suit up

Kingsley grabs Danvers and they all re-enter the bridge
Jenkins catches up to the group

JENKINS
Im coming too

HARTLEY
I dont think thats a good idea
Captain

JENKINS

I have a crew to protect I want to
know what happened on that boat
Its my responsibility

Hartley turns to Danvers for help but he just shrugs as if to

say why not
INT BRIDGE AUSTRALIS
Willie sits on the bridge watching a computer screen

JENKINS (VO)
Willie were on board the
ENDEAVOUR and entering the main
hatch to commence deck by deck
search

WILLIE
(into intercom)
Roger Skipper

INT ENDEAVOR MAIN PASSAGEWAY -NIGHT

We hear a loud creaking sound as the main hatch is opened and
then crashes into the metal bulkhead wall Beams of light from
powerful flashlights cut through the darkness of boats
interior The emergency lights are still on but give only a
faint glow

The interior is in a deep freeze Everything in the vessels
interior has a coat of ice Water drips from the metal ceiling
as some of the ice forms long icicles The group walks one by
one through the main hatch door

They are all wearing full weather gear Hartley Kingsley and
Warski all hold assault rifles to bear flashlights taped to
the barrels piecing the gloom of the ENDEAVOURs vacant
interior Jenkins speaks into the intercom located on his
jacket vest

JENKINS
OK Willie were in All clear
Lieutenant Hartley is now in
command

Hartley looks around the frozen darkness of the ENDEAVOUR She
turns to the group

HARTLEY
Kingsley take Danvers aft to the
Communications room See what
happened and what data if any can
be retrieved Warski check the
Engine room and see if you can get
the power back on

Hartley looks squarely at Jenkins
HARTLEY (CONTD)
Jenkins you come with me to the
Bridge Anyone sees any signs of
the crew alive or anyone in need of
help- squawk OK lets move

The group splits up and goes their separate directions
Hartley and Jenkins head down the hallway and up a ladder
heading towards the Bridge Jenkins is following close behind
Hartley

JENKINS
I didnt know you felt that way
Lieutenant

Hartley does not turn around as she addresses Jenkins with an
even but biting tone

HARTLEY
I want to keep my eye on you

INT ENDEAVOUR AFT PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Danvers and Kingsley walk slowly through the main aft
passageway Kingsley is at point rifle and light swinging
back and forth He is taking his time methodically checking
each frozen room and compartment they pass before advancing

Danvers seems very nervous and keeps looking around and behind
him He hears a loud groan that reverberates though out the
boat He whispers to Kingsley

DANVERS
What was that

Kingsley does not look back as he continues his systematic
move down the passageway

KINGSLEY
Its the boat shifting in the ice
It makes weird sounds Dont worry-
Its normal Youll get used to it

DANVERS
Right right I knew that

Danvers then hears a low guttural sound similar to what we
first heard on the ENDEAVOUR Danvers sees something move out
of the corner of his eye but when he looks in that direction
nothing is there Kingsley touches his chest and activates his
communication link

KINGSLEY
Kingsley here I dont see any
signs of crew Lieutenant

HARTLEY (VO)
Roger Nobody on this end either
Over

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

Warski walks cautiously into the engine room assault rifle at
the ready The guns flashlight pierces the gloom of the belly
of vessels belly

Warski swings his gun back and forth over the interior of the
room as he walks checking each area The flashlight affixed
to the guns barrel follows the rifles movements piercing
the blackness in brief bursts Warski comes to the main engine
block and sees the destruction

INT ENDEAVOUR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Hartley and Jenkins walk cautiously on to the Bridge Hartley
is in the lead using her weapon and light the same way as
Warski slowly surveying the Bridge interior All the
instruments are dead and there is no sign of any crew members

WARSKI (VO)
Warski here Loo Im in the engine
room The entire engine -the entire
engine block- has been ripped
apart Its totally destroyed No
chance of restart or repair
Whatever happened here was no
accident No sign of any crew
Over

At Warskis description of the scene in the engine room
Hartley and Jenkins look at each other with apprehension
Hartley clicks comm button on her jacket

HARTLEY
Roger Warski Check if theres any
back up generators that are still
operable We need light Over

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
WARSKI
(into intercom)

Check

Warski walks over to the wall with switches and switches on

the engine rooms emergency lights The lights sputter and
flicker for a few seconds but then go on dimly lighting the
room

A loud metallic crash is heard off screen Warski spins
quickly towards the sound and clicks off the safety on his
rifle

Warski walks cautiously towards the sound There is another
smaller metallic noise The sound seems to be coming from a
large locker in the engine room corner Warski walks very
slowly towards the locker

He reaches his hand out to open the locker door Warski puts
his hand on the handle Suddenly the locker door bursts open
surprising Warski Warski jumps back a few feet

From out of the locker falling onto his knees is the bloody
battered Chief Phillips Exec and Second in Command of the
ENDEAVOUR His cloths are ripped and he has wounds on his face
and body Dried blood covers his face and what remains of his
uniform

Phillips is shivering from the bitter cold but also from
something else He is obviously terrified Phillips gets up on
his knees and looks up at Warski the SEALs flashlight
pointed directly into the Chiefs face Phillips is shaking
uncontrollably

PHILLIPS
Please ppplease get out of
here Itll come back Youll bring

it back
Warskis gun is raised pointing straight at Phillips

WARSKI
Who are you Identify yourself

PHILLIPS
Please Im safe here Itll come
back You have to go

Warski looks over Phillips and finally recognizes his Navy
uniform Warski realizes this is a member of ENDEAVOURs crew

WARSKI
Listen calm down Dont worry
Were here to rescue you

A low guttural sound is heard off screen and we see a looming
shape fill the dimly lit background behind Warski

Phillips looks past Warski with a look of recognition and
dread on his face

PHILLIPS
No No I told you-I was safe here
Why didnt you just leave me alone

Warski turns to where Phillips is looking A loud deep growl
is heard as a huge powerful arm swipes through the air
hurling Warski off his feet before he can react

Warskis screams as his rifle sprays bullets and the muzzle
flash from his gun fills the screen as he flies through the
air

INT ENDEAVOUR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley hear the gun fire from the engine room

HARTLEY
Shit

Jenkins and Hartley sprint towards the bulkhead door heading
for the engine room

INT ENDEAVOUR COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

Kingsley and Danvers hear the gunfire as it reverberates
through ENDEAVOUR Kingsly turns towards Danvers

KINGSLEY
Stay here Dont move

Kingsley runs out of the room and races to the engine room
leaving Danvers alone

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

Warski has been thrown half-way across the room landing back
in front of the destroyed engine Warskis shots have damaged
the emergency lighting system The already dim lights now
flicker on and off

The powerful mass that hit Warski can not be made out clearly
in the faint light The mass begins to make its way towards
Warski as he lays in pain on the deck floor

Warski switches his communication link on so the others will
hear what is happening He is in incredible pain but is still
holding his rifle Without aiming Warski fires on full
automatic at the oncoming shadow He screams in terror and
defiance The mass continues to move forward
INT ENDEAVOUR PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley are running as fast as they can through
the boats low ceilings and door frames They hear jumbled
yelling and screams over Warskis open comm link

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
A monstrous roar is heard as we see a massive hand with sharp
claws cleave through the air We hear ripping of flesh bones

cracking off screen The screaming suddenly stops

The mass turns in the dim light towards Phillips We see the
him in close-up

INTERCUT Hartley yells into her comm link as she runs

HARTLEY
Warski Report Warski

She lets go of the comm button and runs faster Jenkins tries
to keep up with her

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

The mass turns slowly towards Phillips Phillips is still on
his knees He has not moved We see another close-up on him
He is sobbing

PHILLIPS
No I told him I was safe

INT ENDEAVOUR PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

INTERCUT We see Jenkins and Hartley and Kingsley running down
stairs and hallways racing to the engine room

Over their comms we hear a terrible grinding ripping sound
and a then a high-pitched scream The scream is quickly
silenced and nothing is heard but static

INT ENDEAVOUR ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

Hartley and Jenkins burst into the engine room Hartleys
weapon searching for a target

HARTLEY
Warski

Jenkins walks slowly over to the remains of the main engine
There is blood on the engine and the floor but no sign of
Warski Kingsley bursts through the engine room door his
weapon at ready Hartley gestures to Kingsley

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Secure the other end of this room
Now

Kingsley heads to the rear of engine room Jenkins bends down
in front of the wrecked engine He sees a strange mix of
blood water and a dark green mucous-like fluid on the floor

KINGSLEY (0S)
Over here Lieutenant

Hartley and Jenkins run over to Kingsley in front of an empty
metal locker The locker is covered with blood and the door is
swinging slowly back and forth There is no sign of Phillips
or Warski Kingsley looks up at Hartley

KINGSLEY
What the fuck happened here

Jenkins and Hartley stare at each other in grim silence
INT ENDEAVOUR COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

The room is small and cramped Dead and frozen computer and
radar screens line the walls The emergency lights have been
turned on casting a faint eerie glow around the room

Everyones breath can be seen in the frozen temperatures of
the interior of the room Kingsley walks over to an empty
table in the center of the room and drops Warskis gun and
comm link onto the center of the table

KINGSLEY
This is it This is all we found

Danvers picks up the comm link and studies it He turns
towards Hartley with disbelief on his face

DANVERS
There was no sign of anything else
No gun no body

HARTLEY
Nothing just blood and spent
shells I have to radio this in

DANVERS
Wait Hartley Why dont we wait
We dont actually know what exactly
happened down there

Hartley rushes at Danvers furious
He pauses

HARTLEY
One of my men is dead

DANVERS
We dont know that for sure I
understand your feelings right now
but its not our call to make We
are going to rendezvous with the
COPLEY tomorrow We can brief the
Admiral and then send in our
report

and slowly gingerly continues

Technically Lieutenant the
Commander of the COPLEY is in
charge of this operation

Jenkins is sitting at a table in the corner of the room He
looks over at Danvers

JENKINS
Are you going to tell them about
Vostok or should I

Everyone in the room turns towards Jenkins Hartley and
Kingsley then turn to Danvers waiting for a follow-up
Danvers looks uncomfortable but starts talking slowly and
deliberately

DANVERS
There is an ancient lake that is
hidden beneath the ice on
Antarctica not to far from our
current position Lake Vostok The
water underneath that lake is a
time capsule an isolated ecosystem
that has existed in total
darkness for thousands maybe
millions of years There may be
some kind of micro-organisms
-life-underneath that Lake Life
that we have never encountered
before

Danvers begins to get more animated as he explains

DANVERS (CONTD)
It may contain thousands of
different types of other marine
life as well All on a cellular
level but life just the same
ENDEAVOURs mission was to study
this time capsule by drilling down
through that two miles of ice and
bring back proof Actual samples

Jenkins stands and approaches the group He does not take his
eyes off Danvers

JENKINS
I understand your experience is
mostly in the Arctic Hartley so
let me break this down for you
Lake Vostok is a haunted house The
one house on the street you grew up
on that you never went near Every
sailor scientist -everyone- knows
to steer clear And just like that
house there are stories about it
that are probably just myths Ghost
stories But bad things happen when
people go near Vostok That much I
do know

Hartley stares cold and hard at Danvers

HARTLEY
This wasnt in my report

Danvers lets out an exhausted tone

DANVERS
Its classified ENDEAVOUR is a
joint USRussian project Its not
exactly a State Secret -its a
boring science expedition - but its
still classified Im sorry but I
was not authorized to tell you

JENKINS
Or didnt want to

Danvers rushes up angrily to Jenkins pointing his finger in
Jenkins face

DANVERS
I had colleagues friends on this
ship So dont give me any of your
shit

Hartley eyes Danvers
HARTLEY
Is there anything else you didnt
tell us Tell me

Danvers walks back over to the table and places his hands
the top He bends his head down in fatigue

DANVERS
Nothing else Except one small
thing Langley wanted to keep quiet
But only because it had no bearing
on this mission

Hartley waits impatiently

HARTLEY
Which is

DANVERS
The ENDEAVOUR while they were
digging for samples found a rock
with some ancient glyphs

JENKINS
Hieroglyphs

Danvers shakes his head

DANVERS
No that always reminds people of
Egypt Theyre pictures or
pictograms more precisely They
may or may be a some ancient
rudimentary language We dont know
yet There are some other markings
as well we havent deciphered Its
probably a fragment of a larger
piece that probably drifted down
here through the ocean currents
over the centuries Maybe longer

Hartley processes this new information

HARTLEY
And it your sure it not have any
relevance to this operation

DANVERS
None As far as I can tell Its a
huge deal to the archaeological
community but to no one else
ENDEAVOUR sent back photos various
scans of the glyph runes Its

on

probably at their base camp because
I dont see it anywhere here No
one at Langley can make heads or
tails of it And its still
classified right now

JENKINS
And thats it Nothing else

Danvers drops his head in fatigue

DANVERS
Im only here to find out about
what is under that lake Nothing
else And thats all Langley wants
as well Find ENDEAVOURs crew any
data we can and get the hell out

Hartley turns and rubs her chin She is quiet for several
seconds She firmly speaks to the entire room

HARTLEY
Danvers is right about the chain of
command For now anyway Well do
another sweep for Warski and any
remaining crew Well rendezvous
as scheduled with the COPLEY and
then take our orders from the
COPLEYs Commander Lets move

EXT ANTARCTICA - ICE SHELF - DAY

We see a number of small black dots on an endless expanse of
white We cut to Danvers Hartley Jenkins and Kingsley all
standing on a barren stretch of ice Jenkins looks over the
barren frozen terrain Jenkins yells over the icy wind to
Hartley

JENKINS
Maybe Im getting old Hartley Or
maybe Ive forgotten how to read
coordinates But how the hell are
we going to rendezvous with the
COPLEY in the middle of this
Shouldnt we be waiting back at the
AUSTRALIS

Hartley smiles faintly and looks up from her hand held
monitor She yells back

HARTLEY

Youre just getting old Jenkins

A slow rumble starts and everyone on the ice looks down The
rumble continues and builds in intensity The ice starts to
move and shake throwing some off balance

A huge crash is heard as about one hundred yards away
something smashes from below up through the ice

An enormous black column slowly ascends through the hole in
the ice Everyone stares at amazement as it rises higher and
higher Slowly they realize it is a submarine rising from
underneath the ice Its Conning Tower juts out of the ice and
stops The Tower is the only part of the submarine visible
the rest of it still underneath the ice

The rumbling shaking and crashing of ice stop The group
continues to stare in amazement Hartley gets close to Jenkins
and talks into his ear

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Bedtime stories for naughty boys
and drunken sailors arent the only
things under the ice Captain

A hatch opens on the Tower of the submarine A small figure
emerges from up top and shouts down at the group

SUBMARINER
Lieutenant Hartley

Hartley waves back in acknowledgment We hear the submariner
from far away There is warning in his voice

SUBMARINER (CONTD)
The Admiral wants to see you Right
way

INT USS COPLEY BRIDGE - DAY

The interior of the nuclear submarine USS COPLEY is small and
very busy Sailors and crew are busy operating their equipment
and attending to their duties The group from the AUSTRALIS
all walk onto the Bridge Hartley salutes a tall man looking
at reports and surrounded by subordinates

ADMIRAL NANTZ glances up at Hartley Nantz is a well-heeled
Navy officer He is an older even elegant man who has the
look and bearing of a privileged upbringing He is tall with a
patrician angular face that seems as if it has never smiled

NANTZ
At ease Hartley right

HARTLEY
Yes Sir

She gestures to Jenkins and Danvers

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Allow me to introduce Captain
Jenkins of the ice breaker
AUSTRALIS and Doctor Danvers of
the CIA

NANTZ
Nice to meet both of you Now
Lieutenant would you kindly tell
me what the fuck Im doing all the
way down here

INT COPLEY CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

The conference room on the COPLEY is really a very large
cubicle Danvers Hartley and Nantz are sitting at the small
table

The Admiral is drinking tea from china set placed in front of
him by a mid-shipman Nantz dismisses the sailor sailor but
does not offer anything to the rest of the group Jenkins and
Kingsley are standing against the far wall Kingsley at
attention

Jenkins is relaxed and looks slightly bored by the ceremony
Nantz sums up the briefing he just received from Hartley

NANTZ
So we were pulled away from a war
games exercise with the Russian
fleet to come babysit a bunch of
wayward scientists Is that it
Lieutenant

Hartley tries to explain

HARTLEY
Sir we think its much more than
that One of my men is missing and
we believe -

NANTZ
(exasperated)
I understand your missing a man He
and the crew of the ENDEAVOUR are
my primary concern right now

Nantz turns and addresses Danvers directly

NANTZ (CONTD)
Any information gathering is on
hold until we clear this thing up
I dont give a shit about your
data Danvers

Danvers holds Nantzs gaze defiantly

DANVERS
You should Admiral This data
this information you dismiss so
cavalierly might help save your
life one day

Nantz stares in disbelief at Danvers
NANTZ
Come again

DANVERS
The origin of life as we know it
may be under that ice New
lifeforms new chemical
interactions What we find down
there could lead us into a new era
of discovery for our planet - new
medicines drugs saving our
environment- the list is endless

Jenkins moves slowly from his position outside of the meeting
and approaches the group

JENKINS
Admiral the scientific aspect of
this mission cannot be ignored Id
like to believe me But Danvers is
right Getting a sample from
underneath Lake Vostok would be
like finding life on Mars Its
important we follow up on it

Danvers looks appreciatively at Jenkins Nantz waves his hands
in front of his face dismissing the argument and moving on

NANTZ
OK OK So whats the next step

DANVERS

Theres a small scientific outpost
on top of the Lake itself- Vostok
Outpost 1- that ENDEAVOUR set up
to do the deep core drilling To
get the samples Its only about
about one kilometer from where we
are right now

Nantz stands up quickly and Hartley and Kingsley stand at
attention Jenkins barely moves

NANTZ
Alright lets break up this
cluster fuck Ill send two of my
crew -armed- along with you because
I do not know what exactly is going
on here We have two Arctic Cats on
board You can use as well Theyll
get you to the base Your orders
are to check it out and radio back
what you find Dismissed

The group disperses and everyone walks out of the briefing
room Hartley is the last to leave Nantz discretely but
intentionally steps in front of Hartley blocking her way

NANTZ
Hartley

Hartley looks up at Nantz

HARTLEY
Sir

Nantz looks directly into Hartleys eyes

NANTZ
Go there do what you have to do and come back I dont want
to spend any more time in this shit hole than I have to

EXT ROSS ICE SHELF - EVENING

We see a large hill of ice The wind is blowing fiercely
making the snow dance around the tip of the hill It looks
like a desert of white

Just then we see several vehicles pop over the hill jump
slightly at the top and head down the hill with surprising
speed They are Arctic Snow Cats large snow and ice ATVs
with tracks like a small tank

There are two Cats and they are making their best speed
through the maelstrom of snow and ice all around them

INT SNOW CAT - EVENING

Danvers and Jenkins are in the back of the one of the Snow
Cats Hartley is driving She peers back over her shoulder as
she navigates the dangerous terrain

HARTLEY
Were almost there A few hundred
meters Weve been trying to reach
them by radio Still nothing

JENKINS
You know as well as I do theyre
probably all dead Whatever was on
that ship probably was here first

Jenkins looks out the window of the Cat barely seeing a
anything through the storm

JENKINS (CONTD)
Well I signed on to get you down
here but not for this If I go any
further I want a) more money or b)
a gun

While still driving the Snow Cat through the near white out
conditions and not looking back Hartley grabs an assault
rifle from the unoccupied seat next to her She tosses it back
at Jenkins

HARTLEY
b) it is Im assuming you still
know how to use it New model same
idea

Jenkins smiles softly at Hartley and begins to check the
weapon Danvers stares at the weapon Jenkins and then
peevishly up to Hartley in the drivers seat

DANVERS
You know I did pass the required
agency training Why dont I get
one

Hartley ignores Danvers and continues to drive through the
blizzard She reacts as if she sees something out the Cats
windshield She looks back at Jenkins and Hartley Danvers
looks petulant talking almost to himself

DANVERS (CONTD)
Im the one in the CIA

Hartley interrupts Danvers annoyance with a firm voice

HARTLEY
Were here

EXT LAKE VOSTOK - DEEP CORE DRILLING STATION 1 - NIGHT

The Snow Cats move slowly down a hill as we see a long shot of
a group of buildings one main unit in the center and several
smaller to the side

They are makeshift buildings corrugated steel and aluminium
constructs It is a temporary camp not supposed to last more
than a few weeks

The outside camp lights are on casting an eerie glow in
swirling snow and ice buffeting the camp The wind is so
strong that some pieces of the aluminium buildings bend and
clank back and forth The clanging metal sounds echo
throughout the camp

There is no sign of activity The camp looks deserted

A helicopter can be seen off to the side of the camp Its
propellers are not tied down in the wind as they should be
the blades shaking in the fierce wind

INT SNOW CAT - NIGHT

Hartley Jenkins and Danvers all peer through the glass of the
Arctic Cat none of them liking what they see

JENKINS
Doesnt look like anybodys home

Jenkins cocks his gun
EXT VOSTOK CAMP - NIGHT

The Cats pull in front of the main building The doors of both
vehicles open and three figures emerge from each Jenkins
Danvers and Hartley from one Kingsley and two other armed
sailors SANCHEZ and PRICE from the USS COPLEY

All are armed with assault rifles They are all heavily
clothed parkas pulled up goggles covering their eyes from
the freezing wind

Hartley gestures to Kingsley with hand signals Kingsley
follows the orders and takes point as the the two armed
sailors from the COPLEY fall back to guard the groups rear
The group then advances in that formation to what appears to
be the main building
INT LAKE VOSTOK BASE- DEEP CORE DRILLING STATION MAIN
BUILDING - NIGHT

The door is pushed open by Kingsley and he enters cautiously
swinging his weapon in wide arcs to make sure the interior is
clear Hartley and the others then enter slowly behind him

The regular lights in this building all appear to be
functioning normally The heat seems to be working The room
they enter is an large open space with desks and computers on
the side walls

In the center of the room is a mechanical device that looks
like a large drill The apparatus is shut down and not
operating

The drill hovers over a small hole about the size of small
manhole cover The hole extends down into the earth Danvers
walks over to the machine Danvers becomes excited

DANVERS
Theres the drill

Hartley surveys the room and the drill and then looks down
into the hole

HARTLEY
Thats it I thought it would be
bigger

DANVERS

No no theyre not drilling for
oil after all They just need a
decent size hole to break through
the ice drill all the way through
the ice until they hit the water
hidden underneath Then they
retrieve their samples But its a
long way down

He looks up at the drill and down the hole The hole fades
into a black nothingness

DANVERS (CONTD)
It certainly looks like they may
have gotten down the two miles
Well know for sure once we find
samples

Danvers looks around the desks near the walls rummaging
through desks knocking over beakers and vials

DANVERS (CONTD)
But I dont see anything here
Theyre probably in one of the
smaller buildings They must have
used those as a storage area

Jenkins who has been scanning the room walks over to
Hartley He gets close enough to Hartley for her to hear but
no one else

JENKINS
It looks abandoned I dont see
signs of a struggle No blood

HARTLEY
But where is everybody There were
twelve crew supposed to be
stationed here another eight back
on the ENDEAVOUR Twenty people
dont just vanish into thin air

Danvers sighs as he looks through the vials not finding the
samples He starts to head back to the main door

DANVERS
Lets go check the other buildings
Its probably the one next door

HARTLEY
Wait Danvers Kingsley I want you
to go with him and take Price here
with you No body goes anywhere
alone Anything moves and doesnt
identify itself kill it

KINGSLEY
Yes sir

Danvers Kingsly and Price walk to the main entrance their
face-masks and hoods back on and exit outside Jenkins walks
over to a table filled with maps computers diagrams etc He
picks up a crumpled paper map of Antarctica with red
concentric circles and numbers written across the top Jenkins
appears lost in thought and quietly speaks to himself

JENKINS
Piercing the veil

Hartley looks at Jenkins not hearing him

HARTLEY
What

Jenkins shrugs as Hartley jolts him out of his reverie

JENKINS
Nothing Something Danvers said
ENDEAVOUR -this entire mission- was
to look for new life right New
life on this planet I was serious
about what I said to Nantz -it
would be an incredible discovery
An epic find

HARTLEY
And You said that would be great
right

Jenkins walks slowly around the room and then over to the
drill and the hole underneath it

A large thud hits the outside wall Sanchez turns quickly -
weapon at ready - and scans the camp from the window He sees
a small piece of metal flapping in the wind Sanchez looks
back to Hartley

SANCHEZ
Nothing Sir Just the wind

Jenkins continues to Hartley

JENKINS
Danvers was telling me how
Antarctica is linked to all these
ancient stories-a lot of which I
know already But he said that it
was once thought to be the original
location of Atlantis or some other
great civilization stuff like
that He said these cultures may
have flourished down here
thousands of years ago

Hartley looks confused

HARTLEY
Im not following you Jenkins

Jenkins walks over and peers down the hole It stretches deep
into pitch darkness Jenkins looks back up and back to
Hartley

JENKINS
What if there arent any NEW life
forms down there What if there are
OLD life forms And what if
ENDEAVOUR wasnt discovering
anything down there but

A look of recognition and terror spreads over Jenkins face
as he quickly turns back to face Hartley

JENKINS (CONTD)
But was actually letting whatevers
down there out

Jenkins grabs Hartley and starts to push her towards the main
door Hartley pushes him away

JENKINS (CONTD)
We have to get out of here Now

Hartley starts to protest but looks into Jenkins eyes She is
beginning to trust his instincts She lowers her rifle and
raises her hand in order to press her intercom button

Suddenly something we can not make out jumps up through the
drill hole with an incredibly loud otherworldly roar

Jenkins Hartley and Sanchez are shocked and taken completely
by surprise The creature lands right in front of Sanchez and
we see it in full and close up for the first time

It is humanoid in appearance It is nearly seven feet tall and
it is a massive yet also lean and sinewy Its entire body is
covered with a green blueish mucous-like slime that
highlights the powerful muscles that covers its body

The creatures’ arms are longer than the rest of its body It
has huge hands with fingers that resemble claws

The head is reptilian in appearance with a long snout and
massive jagged teeth But there are definite human
characteristics to the face the entire appearance

Sanchez is stunned by the sudden appearance and hideousness of
the supernatural being The creature snarls at Sanchez and
begins to advance towards him

Sanchez trains his weapon on the being He pulls the trigger
The gun clicks but nothing happens

The safety of Sanchezs weapon is still on Sanchez quickly
clicks the safety off aims the rifle at the advancing
creature Before he can pull the trigger it closes the
distance between them with remarkable speed and smashes
Sanchez with a powerful blow from its arm

Sanchez cries out and is hit with such force he flies through

44
one of the buildings thick insulated windows The collision
is so powerful Sanchez dies instantly

Hartley and Jenkins stunned from what they have just
witnessed regain their composure and fire at nearly the same
time at the creature while its back is turned to them

The creature screams in pain and grabs its back It turns back
towards them Hartley and Jenkins continue to fire until they
are out of ammo The being is hurt but starts to advance
towards Jenkins and Hartley

Hartley changes her clip and points her weapon at the creature
but its too late The being gets to her in time to knock the
gun out of her hand

Hartley falls down from the blow crashing into desks and
knocking equipment across the floor

The creature approaches Hartley who is still dazed from the
blow It raises its hand fierce claws clearly showing ready
to finish her off

Jenkins cannot find another clip so he quickly looks around
for another weapon He finds one of the long drill shafts
lying next to him The long shaft has sharp diamond-shaped
point Before the creature can strike Hartley Jenkins picks
up the shaft and jams it into the back of the creature

The being howls jagged teeth seen clearly as it screams in
pain Jenkins tries to shove the shaft deeper but the creature
turns suddenly the sheer force of the movement knocking the
shaft loose and throwing Jenkins to the floor

Enraged the creature rushes towards Jenkins his screams
echoing through the room

Jenkins is still holding the shaft He wedges the bottom of
the shaft against the heavy base of the drill The creature
jumps into the air arms and claws extended as it pounces on
Jenkins

As the creature falls the diamond-tipped shaft rips through
its neck killing the creature instantly The creatures face
is inches from Jenkins face as it takes its last breath
Jenkins is breathing hard as the mouth of the dead creature is
only inches from his face

Jenkins looks down at the trunk of creatures body and sees
something written on his chest It appears to be the remnants
of a shirt a navy uniform Very faintly through the dirt and
slime Jenkins can make out the word ENDEAVOUR He looks
stunned

Recovering he is able to crawl out from under the creature
and rushes over to help Hartley Jenkins lifts her up

JENKINS (CONTD)
Come on We have to get out of
here

Jenkins grabs another clip of Hartleys belt and jams it into
his weapon Hartley grabs another and rams it into her gun

JENKINS
Come on run

The two bolt for the door Another creature suddenly jumps up
from out of the hole with a loud roar just as Hartley and
Jenkins break through the main door out into the freezing
night air outside

EXT LAKE VOSTOK BASE - NIGHT

Jenkins looks quickly around but does not see any other
creatures He only sees the other deserted buildings The wind
is still blowing hard

Hartley is bent over still in pain Jenkins grabs her by the
shoulder

JENKINS
Hartley you OK

HARTLEY
Ill be alright

JENKINS
Listen we cant escape using the
Cats -theyre too slow Theyll run
us down before we get one hundred
yards

He looks over to the helicopter He points over at the pad

JENKINS
Can you fly that thing

HARTLEY
I think so Ive passed all the
required training simulations but
never the real thing

JENKINS
Thatll have to do You head for
the chopper get her prepped as

fast as you can Ill be back with
the others Go

Hartley starts to run towards the helipad as Jenkins turns the
opposite direction and runs as fast as he can towards a
smaller building about fifty yards away

CUT TO
INT LAKE VOSTOK CAMP SAMPLE STORAGE BUILDING - NIGHT

Danvers is going through vials and sample containers as
Kingsley stands next to him Price is in far corner away from
the front door of the building standing lookout Kingsley
watches Danvers with interest and some amusement

KINGSLEY
What exactly are you looking for
Danvers

Danvers looks impatient and annoyed

DANVERS
Im looking for those samples But
I dont see anything

Danvers stops mid-sentence as he notices a small box in the
center of the main work station

DANVERS (CONTD)
Here it is The refrigeration unit
I bet the samples are in here

Kingsley laughs softly to himself

KINGSLEY
Like my old dorm room fridge If
you find a beer in there I got
dibs

The heavy front door to the building swings open suddenly and
Jenkins rushes in the cold air and snow following him in

The sample room group has not heard the fighting or gunshots
because the room is well-insulated and because of the storm
raging outside Danvers and Kingsley stop and look at Jenkins
panting and terrified Jenkins gestures towards Danvers with
his rifle

JENKINS
Leave that shit and lets go We
have to go Now
DANVERS
Whats going on I cant leave
these here You even said they
might be priceless-

JENKINS
Danvers leave it and run This
whole thing-its a trap

Just then two huge arms of a creature extend down from
somewhere in the ceiling grabbing Price who is still in the
back corner Everyone turns in shock

Before anyone can react Price is ripped in two by the
powerful arms and blood and innards splatter everywhere
Danvers screams as Kingsley pushes him towards the door

The creature hiding in the ceiling jumps to the ground It is
similar in appearance to the creature Jenkins just killed
Kingsley turns and fires at the being It howls in pain

Danvers starts to pick up more vials Kingsley turns and
smacks the vials out of Danvers hand

KINGSLEY
Schools out Doctor Start running

Danvers hesitates a second Kingsley slaps him across the face
with the butt of his gun not hard enough to hurt but enough
to get Danvers attention

KINGSLEY (CONTD)
Now

Danvers turns and runs for the front entrance As he runs for
freedom the large arm of another creature extends outward
from where it was hiding behind a row of large metal
canisters and knocks Danvers down

Jenkins and Kingsley turn and fire at the new creature The
ceiling creature gathers itself from the gunshots and starts
to close in on Kingsley Jenkins sees the larger creature
almost upon Kingsley and screams in warning

JENKINS
Kingsley

Kingsley turns just in time to avoid a killing blow from the
creature but is slashed viciously along his back He yells in
agony but manages to shoot off off a few more rounds before
falling to the floor The bullets hit the creature hard and at
close range knocking it back and off its feet

The creature who attacked Danvers is hurt from the gun fire
but starts to recover It picks itself up off the floor and
starts to advance on Kingsley and Danvers

Jenkins aims and shoots but his rifle just clicks as he pulls
the trigger He is out of ammunition Kingsley looks down at
his weapon and realizes hes also out

From the ground Kingsley pushes Danvers towards Jenkins who
is still near the front entrance of the sample building
Kingsley yells to Jenkins

KINGSLEY
Ill hold them off Take Danvers
Get out Run Thats an order
Captain

Danvers falls into Jenkins arms Jenkins watches the two
creatures still dazed and hurt but slowly descending on
Kingsley as he lays on the floor mortally wounded from the
attack of the ceiling creature

Jenkins can see the blood oozing from the gashes on Kingsleys
back Jenkins looks at Kingsley and their eyes lock for a
moment Jenkins then grabs Danvers and pushes Danvers out the
front door

The two creatures are yelping and howling as they come in for
the kill Their mouths snap open and their jagged teeth
glimmer in the soft harsh emergency lighting of the sample
room

Kingsley reaches down to his belt and unhooks a phosphorous
grenade He pulls the pin He turns and screams at the
creature nearest him

KINGSLEY (CONTD)
Come on motherfucker

The ceiling creature plunges his head -with mouth wide open-
straight down towards Kingsleys face with incredible force
Kingsley slams his fist holding the grenade deep into the open
maw of the creature just as its head plunges down

EXT LAKE VOSTOK STATION - NIGHT

Jenkins and Danvers are running flat out as fast as they can
They are about thirty yards from the sample building

Suddenly the sample building explodes into a huge fireball
and we hear the dying wails of the creatures inside

The force of the explosion knocks Danvers and Jenkins off
their feet Jenkins stands up and picks Danvers up Danvers
looks like hes going to pass out

Jenkins looks towards the helicopter The blades are spinning
but he knows too slowly He can see Hartley in the cockpit
They are about one hundred yards away Jenkins shakes Danvers

JENKINS
Come on Get up We need to get to
the chopper Hurry

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Hartley is switching buttons on and off trying to get the
blades to spin faster The lights on the landing pad are on as
well as the helicopters own lights The propeller is
spinning

HARTLEY
Come one Come on

Hartley looks up at the propeller as it starts to spin
faster

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Spin you son of a bitch

She looks left out the helicopter window and sees Danvers and
Jenkins racing toward her Suddenly a huge roar to her right
can be heard and we see the gaping mouth of one the creatures
as it fills the pilots side window Hartley gasps in shock

EXT LAKE VOSTOK BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Jenkins and Danvers are running full out towards the copter
their breath steaming in front of them at their effort

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The creature begins to slam the pilots side window as Hartley
fumbles for her side-arm Hartley grabs her pistol and jams it
into the window gun hole She fires repeatedly until her clip
empties

We hear the creature scream in pain from being shot at such
close range Hartley stares out the window again The creature
is gone We see through cracks in the supposedly shatterproof
glass there is no sign of the creature

EXT LAKE VOSTOK BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Jenkins and Danvers make it to the helicopter open the back
door and jump in

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jenkins and Danvers jump into the back seat of the helicopter
and Jenkins slams the door shut

JENKINS
Lets go Hartley

HARTLEY
Im trying I dont have enough
lift

The propeller is spinning very rapidly now It makes slight
movements off the ground but then settles back on the helipad

Jenkins looks out the helicopter window and sees six or seven
creatures descending rapidly on the helicopter from different
directions throughout the camp

Their hot breath fills the air in front of them as they scream
and howl They are closing fast Still looking at the
creatures Jenkins pleads with Hartley

JENKINS
Hartley

HARTLEY
I see them Just a few more
seconds

Danvers looks out the helicopters window at the creatures He
looks at them with excitement even admiration

DANVERS
My God Theyre incredible

Jenkins looks at Danvers as if hes insane The helicopter
starts to rise

HARTLEY
Hang on

Jenkins looks out the side window The creatures are nearly on
top of them The helicopter takes off and begins to ascend

The creature that Harley shot at close range jumps on the
landing railings just as the the helicopter begins to rise
The creature climbs up on the rails and roars as it begins to
smash the side passenger glass with powerful blows

The helicopter tilts awkwardly with the added weight It stops
rising

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Shit Jenkins get it off

Jenkins jumps over Danvers and sticks his gun through the
firing hole in the door He fires but again just hears a
click forgetting he has no more ammo He looks around the
interior of the helicopter

He sees a fire extinguisher on the helicopter cabin wall He
slams open the chopper door dislodging the creature slightly

The creature swipes his claws at Jenkins narrowly missing
him Danvers looks out the window on the other side and sees
that the rest of the creatures are almost on top of them

Jenkins steps outside onto the railing barely missing another
lunge by the creature

Jenkins sprays the fire extinguisher in the face of the
creature who howls and raises his head more in surprise than
pain

Jenkins quickly grabs the extinguisher and sticks it under the
protruding chin of the creature Jenkins pushes up with all
his might The top of the creatures barely moves but
finally it lifts just a little

Just enough that the helicopter blades cut off the top piece
of its head The creature falls off the helicopters landing
gear dead before it hits the ice

The helicopter rises fast as the other creatures arrive at the
helipad The closest one jumps for the chopper as it ascends
and narrowly misses grabbing the railing as the helicopter
safely takes off into the frigid night air

Jenkins climbs back into the helicopter and slams the door
INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Everyone catches their breath as Hartley flies into the night

back towards the ENDEAVOUR and COPLEY Hartley screams over
the roar of the engines and propeller

HARTLEY
What happened to Kingsley and
Price

JENKINS

They didnt make it All dead

HARTLEY
And so is the entire crew of the
ENDEAVOUR

Jenkins looks out the window back towards the camp and the
creatures on the helipad

JENKINS
I dont think so Not exactly

DANVERS
What do you mean

Jenkins yells at Hartley over the noise of the propellers

JENKINS
Head back to AUSTRALIS quick as
you can Theres a helipad aft Can
you radio COPLEY or AUSTRALIS

HARTLEY
I tried both their comm systems
are out Or jammed Whats going
on Jenkins

JENKINS
I dont know anything right now
except we have to get the fuck out
of here Lets just get back We
can talk all we want after we set
sail and call for help

EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

The helicopter comes in to sight as we see the AUSTRALIS in
foreground of the frame It is lit up as before We can see
the submarine COPLEY illuminated in the distance by its own
outside lights the conning tower jutting out from underneath
the ice

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Danvers and Jenkins are looking out the window below Danvers
turns to Jenkins for reassurance

DANVERS
Everything looks OK here doesnt
it

Jenkins ignores Danvers and taps Hartley on the shoulder
Jenkins points downward towards the aft of the AUSTRALIS

JENKINS
Put her down there Hartley Theres

a lot of junk on the pad - we never
use it - so be careful

EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

The helicopter makes a bumpy landing on the helipad of the
AUSTRALIS The doors open and Jenkins Danvers and Hartley all
exit as the propeller starts to slow down Jenkins screams
over the wash of the helicopter

JENKINS
Nice landing Lieutenant Follow me
to the bridge - we need to send out
SOS and distress calls over all
channels not just military

Jenkins begins to run and jumps through the outer hatch into
the interior of the AUSTRALIS He is heading for the Bridge
Danvers and Hartley follow him closely

INT AUSTRALIS BRIDGE - NIGHT

Jenkins opens the Bride door and stops cold at what he sees
Hartley and Danvers catch up to him We see three creatures
standing in the middle of the Bridge

The creatures are standing somewhat silent making only odd
gurgling nosies They are not making there usual growls They
are swaying slowly back and forth

At their feet kneeling are Willie and the rest of the Bridge
crew some bloody and cut one sobbing Willie looks up at
Jenkins with a pleading look in his eyes as if to say sorry

Hartley and Jenkins raise their guns and point them at the
creatures ready to fire Danvers grabs their rifle butts
stopping them

DANVERS
No Dont shoot

The creatures do not move but continue to sway back and forth
The low guttural noises of the creatures like purring
engines and the normal bridge sounds radar etc are the
only noise filling the Bridge Danvers turns to Jenkins

DANVERS (CONTD)
Wait Please

Jenkins looks at Danvers with astonishment Hartley keeps her
gun trained on the creatures

DANVERS (CONTD)

Before you do anything just wait
This is going to seem like an odd
request especially after what we
just went through But before we do
anythinglet me try to communicate
with them

Jenkins and Hartley look at Danvers as if hes lost his mind

HARTLEY
Are you crazy Theyre monsters
Danvers You saw what they did back
at the Camp You cant communicate
with them

DANVERS
If thats true why dont they
attack us Why is your crew still
alive Captain

Jenkins looks back and forth between Danvers Hartley and the
Creatures not sure what to do

DANVERS (CONTD)
Let me try Captain They may be
more intelligent than you think
Not like us obviously And deadly
true But maybe we are the ones who
made a mistake Maybe we invaded
their territory their home Maybe
theres a reason they attacked us
Let me try We have nothing to
lose

Danvers turns and looks imploringly at Hartley Hartley does
not take her eyes of the creatures She shakes her head
slowly

HARTLEY
I dont know But since were
almost out of ammo I guess its
worth a try But when I say drop
you hit the floor and cover your
head

Danvers nods in agreement and turns around to face the
creatures He begins to walk slowly and cautiously towards the
creatures with his hands in the air showing he has nothing to
hide and is not carrying any weapons

Danvers walks in front of the largest creature located in the
center The creatures do not react at all

Danvers begins to make low guttural noises similar to the
creatures but lacking the deepness and other ambient noises

DANVERS
(translation)
SUPER Welcome my Lord You have
been away far too long

The creatures continue to display no reaction Jenkins looks
over at Hartley

DANVERS
SUPER Your subjects have been
awaiting your return All is ready
I have devised a way to free you
all from your icy prison I ask
only to worship at your feet when
you take back what is rightfully
yours

The creature Danvers is addressing begins to make noises The
same low guttural sounds Danvers made but with more depth and
intonation

BEING LEADER
(translation)
SUPER You have done well slave
You will be rewarded when we
reclaim this world You will
worship at our feet and rejoice in
the pain

Jenkins moves closer to Hartley and whispers

JENKINS
I dont like this

Danvers turns back towards Jenkins and Hartley and gestures
with his arms toward them

DANVERS

(translation)
SUPER These two have been
instrumental in helping free you
Not willingly of course but
helpful nonetheless They will be
useful to us If you see fit
Master please do not kill them
Not yet

Danvers then points directly at Jenkins

DANVERS (CONTD)

SUPER This one in particular is
very strong in body and mind He
will make an excellent host for
you

Just then two creatures we have not seen grab Jenkins and
Hartley from behind Jenkins and Hartley drop their guns as
they struggle The two creatures do not hurt them but hold
them tightly Jenkins and Hartley struggle to break free

Jenkins looks up and sees the face of the creature holding
him It looks very much like Captain Nantz of the COPLEY He
glances at the creatures chest and sees the remains of a
uniform and the name NANTZ

Danvers walks slowly towards Jenkins and speaks to him in
English

DANVERS (CONTD)
Theres no use struggling Captain
This is all going to happen no
matter how hard you resist

JENKINS
Danvers what the fuck is going on
here

DANVERS
I tried to tell you before
Captain

Danvers turns back to the creatures pointing at the three
creatures holding the crew

DANVERS (CONTD)
Ten thousand years ago these
Beings ruled over this entire
planet They held dominion over
evey thing and everyone We were
barely what you would call
cavemen at the time But we served
Like all the rest

HARTLEY
Thats impossible

Danvers approaches Hartley the creature still holding her

DANVERS
Impossible To someone like you
Hartley everything by the book and
by regulations everything is
impossible You see now with your
own eyes and still you dont
believe Some people are just not

aware But many in the military are

like that Hartley No reason to be
ashamed

Hartley bristles at Danvers words and struggles harder to
break free from the Being but to no avail She is held more

tightly

Danvers turns and looks knowingly at Jenkins without moving

Danvers walks gets very close to Hartleys face

DANVERS (CONTD)
But the Captain knows what Im
talking about Dont you
Jenky He understands there are
unseen things in between the cracks
of what we call reality Thats why
he is quite understandably afraid
of Lake Vostok Those ancient
stories were not sailors yarns but
rather warnings The existence the
signs of these Beings and other
paranormal events have always
been there In the arts painting
literature high brow and low Even
the Bible Do you know Ezekiels
Wheel from the Bible

in the eyes

The large

DANVERS (CONTD)
No of course not Youre just a
tool Lieutenant As subtle as a
hammer You were warned Even given
the keys - ways to help you
understand And everything you have
dismissed your entire life as
fantasy is now staring you right in
the face and holding you in its
cold grasp

staring her

creature starts making more guttural noises

BEING LEADER
(in English)
Enough Do not try to explain the
unexplainable to these lowly
things

Hartley looks stunned

HARTLEY
You speak - English

BEING LEADER
Your tongue is a most crude
uttering As simple and repulsive
as your very race

The Being Leader looks around the Bridge

BEING LEADER (CONTD)
However you have made great
strides in your tools in our long
absence That will help us But
your role in life will always be to
serve slave You are still ours
now and forever And you will
continue to make do as hosts

HARTLEY
Hosts

Danvers walks back to the center of the bridge

DANVERS
Yes I think Jenkins has figured
this part out already

Danvers smiles at Jenkins

DANVERS (CONTD)
These beings need hosts to survive
They merge with whatever life forms
they find and make new life forms
Thats how they stayed alive down
there so long Thats how I knew
they would still be alive
underneath that frozen mass even
after thousands of years But they
need your bodies now ENDEAVOUR and
COPLEYs crew have all been

Danvers pauses for effect

DANVERS (CONTD)
Absorbed Taken over while we gave
them the time and opportunity The
base camp was indeed a trap
Captain One of my own making to
give these magnificent beings time
towell make new friends

JENKINS
You piece of shit

Ignoring Jenkins Danvers turns back to the Being Leader

DANVERS
Master we do not deserve to see
your power just as we do not
deserve to be in your very
presence But perhaps you can give
us a glimpse so these future hosts
will know your might And so they
can revel in the glory that is
yours to come

BEING LEADER
You have done well Danvers
creature - you will have a taste of
our power And you will ne spared
this fate because of your help and
respect for our greatness These
early hosts are reaching the end of
their usefulness Some of us need
to exchange

The Being Leader gestures towards one of the other Beings
standing next to him The tattered uniform shows it is one of
ENDEAVOUR crew

The Being approaches Willie picks him up and grabs him
holding him close Willie screams and kicks trying
desperately to break free Jenkins tries to break the grip of
the Being holding him

JENKINS
Willie

Willie and the Being start to merge It is a horrible sight
and sound Willies entire body is broken backward in two and
starts to be sucked into a small hole that appears from
nowhere in the center of the Being

Willie screams as he is slowly absorbed sucked into a hole no
bigger than a half dollar in the Beings chest The Being
begins to change shape before our eyes The Beings form
shifts his skin ripples and bones break and stretch to fit
the new form

Once the transformation is complete the Being still is a
grotesque creature but know it looks like an amalgam of Willie
and the Creature Jenkins grunts in anguish

JENKINS
Christ Willie
The Being Leader turns and addresses Danvers

BEING LEADER
Enough for now Take these hosts
away until it is their privilege to
offer themselves up to our Glory
Then return so we can being the
process of freeing our Brothers

DANVERS
As you wish Master

The Beings gather up the crew Jenkins and Danvers and drag
them off the Bridge

INT ENDEAVOR CAPTAINS QUARTERS - NIGHT

Hartley and Jenkins are sitting on two wooden chairs in the
middle of the room Their hands and feet are tied to the chair
with strong nylon rope The room is the usual ships berth
small even for a Captains room

There is a porthole on the outer wall Through it can be seen
the large black Tower of the USS COPLEY still brightly
illuminated as it sticks up through the ice

HARTLEY
Where do you think theyre holding
the crew Why are we separated

Jenkins looks tired and resigned He is not even struggling
against his ropes

JENKINS
I think Danvers has something
special planned for us

The door to the Captains quarters opens and in walks Danvers
DANVERS
Just wanted to remind you theres
cocktails and shuffle board on the
Lido deck in five minutes

Hartley strains at her ropes a look of fury on her face

HARTLEY
You fucking traitor

Davers grabs an empty chair and turns it around placing his
arms akimbo on the chair back

DANVERS
Come now Hartley You have to be
loyal to something first to be able
to betray it And Im only loyal to
myself

HARTLEY
Youre going to let those things
out Let them loose on the world
How many thousands of them are
there Danvers

Danvers wags a finger at Hartley correcting her

DANVERS
Millions Lieutenant from what I
can gather

HARTLEY
What are they doing down there
under that lake Where the hell do
they come from

DANVERS
Who knows Outer space inner space
another dimension I dont have all
the answers my soon to be pet But
they were here before us - that
much I have figured out From that
ancient tablet that I said was of
no consequence Its also how I
figured out their language

Jenkins looks up

JENKINS
So you did decipher it And just
didnt tell anyone at Langley You
did know they were down here all
along

DANVERS
Yes I deciphered it But who was I
to tell Captain No one would have
believed me You have to sell the
Intelligence Community on
terrorists or global warming or
something more current Ten
thousand year old bogeymen are just
not sexy enough for them

Danvers seems to be enjoying himself as he tells the story
DANVERS (CONTD)
But getting back to your question
Hartley How did they get trapped
Im assuming some cataclysmic
event a massive earthquake
probably devastated this region
the entire planet most likely And
just like that

Danvers snaps his fingers

DANVERS (CONTD)
What was once their throne became
their prison They became trapped
in an underwater tomb of ice with
no way out But theyve been there
in the dark waiting Waiting for
some one like me to come along

Jenkins looks at Danvers with contempt

JENKINS
And you of all people knew they
were here And how did you know
that for sure Danvers There could
have been nothing down here

Danvers turns viciously towards Jenkins

DANVERS
Because while we were lying
shitfaced in some bar re-living
your glory days I was reading
studying preparing for mine Not
just that piece of tablet Is
studied everything Plato to Blake
Even geniusesCrowley Cayce The
signs all pointed to something
being down here

Jenkins begins to laugh slightly Danvers looks quizzically at
him

DANVERS
Something funny Captain

JENKINS
You Danvers Ill admit you had us
fooled We did play right into it

Even helped you didnt we But
youve forgotten one important
thing

DANVERS
Which would be

JENKINS
How to get them all out Are
millions of them all going to
crawl up through that little hole
at base camp one at a time By the
time a few hundred make it up the
Navy will be here and blow them all
back to whatever hell they crawled
up from

Danvers shakes his head slowly as if admonishing an errant
school boy

DANVERS
O Captain my Captaindid you
really think I would plan all this
go to all this trouble and not
have that part figured out

Danvers stands up and starts to walk around the room
seemingly talking to himself

DANVERS (CONTD)
I will admit though that was the
hard part Believing these
creatures existed that was one
thing Getting down to Antarctica
and proving they existed that was
another But freeing them from
their prison-well that was the real
trick

JENKINS
Let me guess- global warming
Youre going to wait until the ice
melts

Danvers laughs heartily

DANVERS
Global warming very good Very
good indeed Global warming -if it
exists - would just take too much
time Captain Time as you have
pointed out my Masters and I just
do not have There is only one
thing on this planet that can melt
two miles of ice in an instant

Jenkins looks confused The Conning tower of the COPLEY
catches Jenkins eye out the porthole window Jenkins stops
grinning His face tightens in horror at the realization of
Danvers plan Danvers notices the look of recognition and
dread on Jenkins face

DANVERS (CONTD)
Thats right Captain A nuclear
device That was last piece of the
puzzle the key to opening the
prison doors I needed a nuke here
at the same time I was here and

Danvers walks over and puts his arm around Hartley

DANVERS (CONTD)
Thanks to the CIA and the NAVY -
well here we are

Hartley again struggles at her ropes in vain

DANVERS (CONTD)
A nuclear warhead - a relatively
small device -from one of the
COPLEYs torpedoes will be
re-calibrated with a timer dropped
into the drill hole at base camp
Then we will all sail away on the
AUSTRALIS and watch the fireworks
from a safe distance

HARTLEY
You maniac That will melt the
polar cap Youll flood the world
killing thousands

Danvers corrects Hartley again

DANVERS
Millions Lieutenant But that will
be the least of your troubles
After the ice melts millions
maybe billions of these Beings will
pour forth all in need of hosts
They will spread all over the
world Anyway you look at it
humanitys role as the dominant
life form on this world is at an
end

JENKINS
And what about you Danvers Why
are you doing this What do you get
out of it

Danvers bends down and stares Jenkins squarely in the face

Danvers walks over and strokes Hartleys hair She winces and

DANVERS
It might seem petty Captain But I
get revenge For years Ive been
belittled scorned - shit on
really - because I didnt have the
right connections the right
pedigree Not enough of political
savvy to make it through the ranks
Not being a host is certainly one
benefit But even being a slave
might have some perks

tries to move her head away

DANVERS (CONTD)
So once the new world order is
established Ill be closer to the
top of the food chain than the
bottom Which is more than I can
say for the rest of you

Danvers rises and begins to walk towards the cabin door

JENKINS
It makes no sense Danvers Youre
just exchanging one master for
another

Danvers grabs the cabin door and opens it

DANVERS
You once quoted Milton to me
Remember Captain

Jenkins glares at Danvers Danvers opens the door and steps

through

Jenkins

Danvers

He hesitates in the middle and turns back looking
squarely in the eye

DANVERS
(quoting)
Better to rule in hell than serve
in heaven

slams the hatch door shut

INT AUSTRALIS PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Danvers holds the hatch door He lets go turns and comes face
to face the Being Leader

BEING LEADER
It is time Danvers creature Come
- we must free the others

Danvers lowers his head as in reverence

DANVERS
Yes Master We must go to the
other ship-

Danvers stops and explains

DANVERS (CONTD)
-the large black craft across the
ice - so we can retrieve the weapon
we discussed

BEING LEADER
Excellent

Danvers begins to walk away The Being Leader raises a large

sinewy gelatinous arm blocking Danvers way Danvers looks up
at the Leader

BEING LEADER
But remember Danvers Creature No
tricks Or your suffering will last
as long as our captivity in our
frozen tomb

Danvers nods somberly and begins to walk away
INT ENDEAVOUR CAPTAINS QUARTERS - NIGHT

HARTLEY
We dont have much time Turn the
chairs around and Ill try to see
if I can free one of your hands

Jenkins ignores her He concentrates and with all his might
forces his body as high in the air off the ground as he can

The chair lifts off the ground just a few inches but crashes
hard into the floor The chair falls to the floor with his
entire body weight

The wooden chair breaks into pieces Jenkins extricates
himself from the rope and the debris of the chair Hartley

looks at Jenkins with genuine admiration

HARTLEY
Or that will work

Jenkins begins to untie Hartley

JENKINS
We have to get to the COPLEY before
they arm that nuke

EXT ICE SHELF - NIGHT

We see several creatures the Being Leader and Danvers making
their way to the COPLEY along a string of guiding lights and
ropes stretched between the COPLEY and the ENDEAVOUR The wind
is blowing fiercely They are halfway to the COPLEY We see
the Conning Tower looming in the distance

INT ENDEAVOUR PASSAGEWAY- NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley are quietly making their way through the
main passageway looking for a way off the AUSTRALIS They have
to stop and hide often from Beings walking through out the
vessel

HARTLEY
Can we free the rest of the crew

JENKINS
No time We need to get to our
gear You have extra weapons and
suits in the equipment you brought
on board right We need to get to
it-down in the cargo bay

Jenkins points to a doorway down the end of a long passageway
At the end of the hall is a massive Being guarding the door
to the cargo bay

Jenkins looks around for something to use as a weapon He
looks up at the ceiling and sees the sprinkler system lining
the ceiling of the hallway

He follows the pipes across the ceiling and notices they
extend all the way down the hallway Jenkins whispers to
Hartley

JENKINS
When the being grabbed you and held
you he was cold right

HARTLEY

Freezingand disgusting

JENKINS
Come on I have an idea

Jenkins and Danvers back to another hallway and down a ladder
They land on the next deck floor looking both ways to make
sure no Beings are around

Jenkins hurries down the hall searching for a specific cabin
He finds it and tries the door Its locked so he pushes it
open

INT ENDEAVOUR WILLIES CABIN - NIGHT

Jenkins starts rummaging through drawers in Willies Cabin
Pictures and calendars of half-naked girls line the walls
Also on the wall hanging next to other pictures of whales and
whaling vessels is an old Harpoon It has a massive metal tip

HARTLEY
What the hell are you doing

JENKINS
This is Willies cabin

Jenkins finally stops looking and grabs onto something in the
drawer

JENKINS (CONTD)
Got it

Jenkins holds up a large butane lighter holder and shows
Hartley He places the butane lighter in his pocket then pulls
the Harpoon off the wall He runs out of Willies room holding
the harpoon Hartley confused follows him

Jenkins than stops at another room down the hall FIRE CONTROL
ROOM is painted on the door He enters the room searching
Valves knobs and pipes line the walls

He searches until he finds a control panel labeled SPRINKLER
CONTROL He starts turning a valve on the board

Jenkins opens another valve labelled EMERGENCY WATER RESERVE
and starts turning

HARTLEY
What are doing

JENKINS
When the fire systems water is cut
off in an emergency the sprinklers
can use the hot water from the
engines as a back up

Jenkins looks at Hartley with a faint smile

JENKINS (CONTD)
Danvers and those things want to
heat things up around here Lets
give him what they want

INT COPLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Danvers drops down the main ladder from the top of the Conning
and the outside hatch The Being Leader and his two guards who
have already descended into the vessel and are waiting on
COPLEYs Bridge Danvers points aft and addressees the Being
Leader

DANVERS
This way-

Danvers adds mockingly

DANVERS (CONTD)
My Liege

INT ENDEAVOUR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley make their way back to the end of the
hallway where the creature is guarding the weapons cache and
the entrance to the cargo hold

JENKINS
OK get up my shoulders

Jenkins bends down and begins to grab Hartley around her waist
and lifts her on her shoulders

HARTLEY
Wait a minute

JENKINS
No time to play womans lib Get

up
Hartley gets on his shoulders Jenkins passes her the lighter

JENKINS (CONTD)
Do it

Jenkins clicks the lighter once and it sputters but makes a
very audible click The Being guard appears to notice the
noise and starts to walk towards Jenkins and Hartleys

location

JENKINS (CONTD)
Come on Hartley

Hartley sees the Being approaching She holds the lighter and
it catches fire See holds the flame right under the
sprinkler The sprinkler turns on water pouring out onto
Hartley

INTERCUT

The sprinklers turn on all over the ENDEAVOUR every deck
every compartment

We see creatures throughout the vessel start screaming in
agony as their nearly frigid flesh turns hard then brittle
Body parts start to crack and fall off as the hot water from
the sprinklers washes over them Their wails of agony can be
heard everywhere

INT ENDEAVOUR PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The sprinkler on top of the creature guarding the cargo bay
turns on He is doused in hot water

The Being howls in pain his skin sizzles steams and then
begins to crack like an ice cube dropped into a warm drink

Jenkins grabs Hartley and pulls her off his shoulders He
picks up the Harpoon from Willies room and runs full speed
down the hallway towards the guard

Jenkins jabs full force with the harpoon Jenkins plunges the
harpoon into the chest of the creature and a chunk of the
Beings torso snaps off and falls to the ground

The creature howls again and takes a swipe with back of his
hand claws barely missing Jenkins The Being swipes again
with the his other hand Jenkins falls against the bulkhead
but a piece of the creatures hand breaks away as it smashes
into the bulkhead

The Gards body is still cracking and it is still screaming in
pain Jenkins takes the harpoon and swings it like a bat at
the Beings head

As the heavy harpoon makes contact the Beings head is
smashed into a hundred little pieces The body falls on the
deck in front of Jenkins

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM - NIGHT
Dancers The Being Leader and his two guards enter the Torpedo
room The room is cramped and filled with wiring pieces of
hardware and other tools Most of the room consists of four
large torpedo tubes up front

Dangling from the ceiling are huge metal chains attached to
various rods and pulleys

These chains are used to move the enormously heavy torpedoes
from where they are stored into their tubes for firing

In the center of the room is a large torpedo partially
dismantled The nose of the torpedo is unhinged and there are
wires and electronics showing The Being Leader gestures to
Danvers

BEING LEADER
We have followed your instructions
The weapon has been made ready for
you

Danvers looks at the torpedo in anticipation and approaches
the nuclear bomb

INT AUSTRALIS CARGO BAY - NIGHT

Hartley runs to the assault rifles and small arms lining the
cargo bay wall Jenkins runs to a rack of all-weather suits in
the center of the room and starts to get undressed

They are both soaking wet from the sprinkler Hartley is busy
loading the guns but looks over briefly at Jenkins naked
body Jenkins smiles slightly

JENKINS
Impressed

Hartley ignores him slaps a round of ammo into the weapon and
tosses him the assault rifle She then throws him two more
clips for the rifle

HARTLEY
We have two clips each left Make
them last

Jenkins throws her an all-weather suit Hartley grabs the suit
in mid air and notices Jenkins grinning

JENKINS
My turn

Hartley matches his gaze and starts to take her clothes off
with no hesitation

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM - NIGHT

Danvers is working on the improvised bomb He looks back at
the Leader Being who is standing over him as he works

DANVERS
Almost finished

The Being Leader corrects Danvers

BEING LEADER
Master

DANVERS
Of course Almost done Master

EXT COPLEY CONNING TOWER - NIGHT

A Being stands guard on the tower A small metallic noise is
heard coming from the side of the ship directly beneath the
tower deck

The creature lumbers over to the source of the noise The
Being bends over the deck railing

Jenkins holding on to the railing underneath stabs upward
with the tip of the harpoon The Harpoon pierces the lower jaw
of the creature jutting through its mouth and squeezing its
upper and lower mouth closed

Jenkins strains at the exertion The creatures scream of pain
and warning is muted because his mouth can not open fully

Hartley jumps onto the Tower from her hiding place next to
Jenkins with uncanny speed and agility

She places her hand gun deep into the side of the creature and
pulls the trigger several times The body of the Being itself
muzzles the sound of gunshots The Being dies trying to scream
a warning in vain

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM

Danvers gets up from his work and points at the device

DANVERS
This is very jury rigged

Danvers turns and explains to the Beings

DANVERS (CONTD)
This device is put together hastily

and not perfectly But it will
work my Lord

He gestures at the bomb There are two small steel tubes each
with a pointed end One hangs about the other with about an
inch between them These are the contact points that will
trigger the bomb Danvers mimics with his hands the action of
the bomb

DANVERS (CONTD)
At the appropriate time these two
points will come together and the
weapon will activate I have a
timer - something that will count
down and activate the device by
itself - on the weapon This will
allow us time to reach a safe
distance

BEING LEADER
And then my brothers will be freed

DANVER
Oh yes Master Then we will all be
free

INT COPLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Two Beings stand at attention on the bridge A metallic clang
is heard on the outer deck hatch The two beings look at each
other We hear another metallic clang One Being climbs up to
the ladder to investigate

NEW ANGLE

The creature opens the outside hatch Hartley is standing
directly above him assault rifle pointed at the Being

We see the Being from above It howls We see Hartley from
below She pulls the trigger and all we see is the muzzle
flash of her rifle filling the screen

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM

The gunshots from Hartleys rifle are heard faintly in the
torpedo room Danvers speaks under his breath

DANVERS
Jenkins

The Being Leader turns to the two Beings who act as bodyguards
for the leader

BEING LEADER
Find them Destroy them Make sure
they do not interrupt us until we
have completed our task Go

The two Beings move out of the torpedo room to intercept
Jenkins and Hartley

INT COPLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Jenkins slides down the ladder from the outside hatch Tower to
the Bridge below Hartley is already on the Bridge checking
the submarines schematics on a computer terminal

JENKINS
Whats the quickest way to the
torpedo room

Hartley points at the computer screen

HARLTEY
This way

Jenkins and Hartley run through a Bridge hatch heading for
the torpedo room

INT COPLEY PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley are moving fast but cautiously They stop
at every turn or bulkhead door to peer around before
advancing They are moving quickly but methodically They do
not see any Beings Hartley speaks softly to Jenkins

HARTLEY
This seems too quiet Where all the
creatures back on the AUSTRALIS

JENKINS
Theyre here all right but maybe
theyre all in the torpedo room
Lets check our ammo one more time
and see what we have before we get
down there

Jenkins and Hartley begin to double check their remaining
ammunition Off screen we hear a low growl Jenkins and
Hartley look down the passageway from where they just came
Jenkins taps Hartley on the shoulder

JENKINS
Lets keep moving We can get
trapped here

Jenkins and Hartley move slowly down the passageway towards
the ladder that will bring them to the next deck of the COPLEY
and the torpedo room in the submarines bow

They hear the low growl again from in back of them Hartley
turns suddenly to Jenkins

HARTLEY
Hurry Theyre behind us

Hartley shoulders her rifle and grabs the ladder Jenkins
Screams at her

JENKINS
Hartley wait

Hartley looks up just as she is about to descend the ladder
She does not see the huge arm of a Being Guard behind her
ready to strike

Jenkins drops his weapon and lunges towards Hartley grabbing
her just as the blow strikes The strike misses Hartley but
hits with such force that it buckles the ladder

Jenkins and Hartley fall onto deck Hartleys gun falling out
of her hands from the impact The gun lands right in front of
the Being who is beginning to climb the ladder

The growl from behind turns out to be the other Being Guard
who starts to approach Jenkins and Hartley from the opposite
direction Jenkins and Hartley stand up but can not move They
are trapped in between the two Beings

JENKINS (CONTD)
They must have swung around the
other passageway Were cornered

The Being ascending the ladder from the deck below kicks the
guns away from Jenkins and Hartley

BEING GUARD 1
You have no more weapons to hurt
us No more places to hide It is
time to die like the cur you are

Jenkins looks around and can not see anyway to pass either
guard He turns to Hartley

JENKINS
Do you have any other guns
grenades Anything

HARTLEY
Just my side arm
She un holsters it and pulls it out
HARTLEY (CONTD)
But you know it wont stop them

Jenkins looks around and notices the pipes and cables running
down the length of the passageway

Without hesitating Jenkins grabs the wooden end of the
Harpoon and starts jamming into the various cables and wires
above him in the ceiling

Sparks fly from electrical cables as the harpoon breaks open
the COPLEYs wiring He uses the end of the harpoon to pull

the electrical wiring from the ceiling Sparks fly everywhere

The creatures hesitate a moment wondering what Jenkins is
doing Jenkins turns to Hartley

JENKINS
Hartley you have to take care of
this one

He points to the electrical cables sparking above him The
cables are now hanging down from the ceiling almost at
touching the top of their heads

JENKINS (CONTD)
Draw him in close

Hartley looks up understanding She nods her head

HARTLEY
What about the other one

JENKINS
Leave him to me

Jenkins starts down the passageway towards the Being Guard 2

The creature howls in anticipation of his approaching prey
Jenkins has his harpoon out in front of him

Hartley stands up and fires one shot at the Guard 1 in front
of her The bullet hits it square in the chest It winces and
growls but is otherwise unhurt Hartley shouts at the Being

HARTLEY
Come on you ugly bastard Im just
a dog so teach me to behave

Guard 1 seems to smile slightly at Hartley

GUARD 1
Your death will be painful she
thing

Guard 2 starts towards Hartley Jenkins rushes to meet it
head on and starts jabbing with the harpoon The Guard moves
to avoid Jenkins blows The Guard blocks one jab with its
arms

The Being swings wildly at Jenkins Jenkins pierces its torso
with a quick jab The harpoons strike forces the Guard back
slightly pain and surprise on its face It looks back at
Jenkins with fury in its eyes

Guard 2 approaches Hartley and swings with his powerful
forearm It misses her and slams into the bulkhead rupturing
a steam pipe

Steam billows out and starts to fill the passageway Hartley
fires another shot but it seems to merely annoy Guard 1 She
steps back making the creature follow her The sparks fall
from the severed electrical cables dangling from above

Jenkins continues to back up Guard 2 The Being is getting
frustrated and howls in anger Jenkins continues to move
quickly jabbing with the harpoon and inflicting large wounds
on the creature

One thrust goes deep into the Being It screams but smashes
down with all its might breaking the harpoon in half and
knocking Jenkins to the deck The harpoon end is still
sticking out of the Being The Guard painfully but with
incredible strength and will pulls it out of its side

Jenkins sees the steam filling the passageway and appears to
get an idea He runs over to a large pipe and stands directly
in front of it He then looks back at GUARD 2 holding the
harpoon piece with its blood on it in its hands Jenkins
screams at the Guard

JENKINS
Come on you pussy Cant you kill
a puny thing like me

The Being roars at Jenkins and runs straight towards him
Jenkins stands still waiting for exactly the right moment The
Beings arms extend out towards Jenkins Jenkins ducks at the
last minute

The Beings powerful fist smashes into the steam valve
rupturing it and causing a huge burst of hot steam to blow

right into the guards face and body

The Guard cries in agony as the hot steam and its cold body
collide The Being is immobilized instantly then begins to
turn solid crackle and then explode as the heat of the steam
breaks apart its frigid body

Jenkins lies on the deck in amazement as pieces of the
creature fall all over the deck

Meanwhile Hartley is still walking cautiously backwards as
Guard 1 follows her She pauses as the creature is right
below the sparking cables hanging from the ceiling

GUARD 1
Come now my small one Why not
make this easy Just come to me and
I will end all your suffering For
you at least there will be no more
pain

Hartley looks up and realizes the wires are too high for her
to reach She looks at the guard 1 and holsters her side arm
She talks calmly to the creature

HARTLEY
You know youre right I do want
to die quickly

Guard 1 stops staring suspiciously at Hartley

Hartley runs at full speed and jumps right into the chest of
the Guard Taken by surprise The Being grabs her
instinctively and pulls her close to him Their faces are
inches apart

HARTLEY (CONTD)
Just not today fucker

Hartley quickly extends her arms up towards the two cables
still sparking She grabs them in both hands by the protective
plastic sheath covering the wires and before the Being can
react she jams both ends into the Guards ears

The Being starts to scream and sparks fly out of its eyes and
mouth Hartley holds on and pushes the wires deeper into the
creatures ears Hartleys insulated uniform is protecting her
from the worst of the shock but she is still getting shocked
She grimaces from the pain

Hartley holds on and pushes deeper Finally the creature
stops making noise and Hartley lets go She falls out of the
creatures arms The dead Being its head smoldering smoke

still pouring from its eyes and mouth slams onto the deck
with a loud crash

Hartley falls on the floor gasping for air Jenkins rushes up
to her

JENKINS
You OK

Hartley still looks hurt

HARTLEY
Feel like shit Numb all over

JENKINS
One way or the other its almost
over Hartley We have to get to the
torpedo room

Jenkins grabs her and holds her up almost as if giving her an
order

JENKINS (CONTD)
Come on Sir we have a job to do

Hartley smiles weakly She walks past the corpse of the Being
Guard and picks up the assault rifles that were dropped She
tosses one to Hartley
HARTLEY

Im supposed to be in command

remember Come on lets move
They head down the ladder towards the torpedo room
INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM - NIGHT

Danvers is making the final adjustments to the device as the
Being Leader stands over him

BEING LEADER
The time is almost upon us

A large crash is heard outside the torpedo room We here shots
being fired The bulkhead door to the torpedo room opens with
a crash and in walk Jenkins and Hartley

The Being Leader turns quickly to Danvers

LEADER
Activate the device Now

Danvers looks horrified by the suggestion

DANVERS
No Well all die

The Being Leader makes his way towards Danvers and the nuclear
bomb

LEADER
I must release the others

JENKINS
Back away Move Or Ill kill you
both

Danvers takes a step back from the Being Leader putting some
distance between himself and the creature He yells back to
Jenkins pointing at the Leader

DANVERS
Kill it Jenkins Kill it Before it
kills us all

The Leader turns and slaps Danvers Danvers smashes against
one of the torpedo tubes and drops to his knees His glasses
are smashed and he is dazed

The Being Leader rushes to the bomb to start the countdown

Jenkins opens up his entire clip into the Leader spinning the
creature around The Leader screams in pain and stops for a
moment But it keeps moving towards the bomb

Jenkins tries to reload as the Leader riddled with bullets
struggles towards the device The Leader falls to its knees in
front of the device It pushes the red button A red LED
display shows 500 and beings to countdown 499 498

Hartley rushes up past Jenkins then fires on full automatic
with her assault rifle until shes out of bullets The Leader
screams again and collapses in a lump near the prostate
Danvers The Leader raises his head slowly up to Danvers
face

LEADER
This body has served its purpose I
require a new host

Danvers looks terrified

DANVERS
What are you talking about

The Being Leader almost looks as if it is smiling
LEADER
Rejoice slave You are about to
become one with your God

With its last bit of strength The Leader grabs Danvers and
pulls him close to its chest Danvers screams and struggles to
break free A small bright hole appears in the chest of the
Leader

Danvers body cracks backward in two like a pencil being
snapped in half Danvers body his very soul are sucked into
middle of the the Being Leader Danverss screams of agony and
terror echo throughout the room and then recede into
nothingness

The Leaders physical shape morphs and it transforms into a
creature that looks like a Being but now also unmistakeably
like Danvers

The Danvers Being stands It looks down appraising its new
form Jenkins and Hartley stare in disbelief at the new
creature There is no evidence of the gunshots that had almost
killed it

DANVERS LEADER
This body is weak But it will
suffice

Jenkins raises his rifle and pulls the trigger The gun clicks
but nothing happens

JENKINS
Shit Im out

Hartley checks her gun and belt

HARTLEY
I only have a few shots from my
-45 Were all out

JENKINS
Not enough Im going to go for the
bomb Try to cover me

Hartley takes out her sidearm and shoots the Danvers Leader as
Jenkins tries to run past it The Leader winces but other wise
shows no pain

The creature understanding what Jenkins is trying to do
swings wildly and knocks Jenkins down Jenkins falls to the
deck with a grunt

Jenkins looks for something to defend himself with and grabs a
metal pipe off the floor that came loose during the fighting

Jenkins swings hard at the Leader The creature blocks the
blow with his upturned arm The Leader swipes back with his
other hand

Jenkins ducks stands and hits the creature with as much
force as he can muster across the face with the pipe The
creature grabs his face in annoyance but is otherwise
unharmed He then then slaps Jenkins several feet across the
room away from the bomb The bomb continues its countdown
148 147

DANVERS LEADER
Danvers was correct You are
strong indeed It is a pity we
will not be able to become one

The Leader gestures with his head towards Hartley

LEADER (CONTD)
Your mate can no longer hurt me
Captain Jenkins But I can hurt
you

The Being grabs Jenkins by the leg and hurls him against the
wall Jenkins falls down to the deck in a slump dazed

LEADER (CONTD)

I can not let you disable the
device According to my former
slave once it is activated - even
from the confines of this vessel -
it will be powerful enough to melt
our icy prison And then my
brethren will be unleashed

The creature looks at the torpedo loading chains that dangle
from the torpedo room ceiling They are swinging wildly from
the battle

The Danvers Leader grabs one of the hanging chains and pulls
it free He wraps one end around his hand the rest of the ten
foot chain lying at his feet

Hartley advances closer to the Leader to get a better shot-
point blank

The Leader flicks his wrist and the chain flies out It
strikes the gun from her hand with incredible precision The
gun falls from Hartleys hand She falls to the deck grasping
her hand in pain The Leader grunts with pleasure

LEADER
I forgot how much pleasure I
derived from whipping my slaves

The Danvers Leader turns back towards Jenkins

LEADER (CONTD)
It is your turn to feel sting of my
lash You will bow to me Captain
You and your world

The creature holds his arm up and brings the chain down hard
Jenkins holds the metal rod up to protect himself The chain
wraps around the metal pole and Leader pulls the rod away from
Jenkins The rod crashes into the wall The force of the
struggle knocks Jenkins into the main torpedo tube

Jenkins looks at the open torpedo bay door next to him The
Being closes in on Danvers

LEADER (CONTD)
Your time on this world is at an
end Captain Just little sooner
than the rest

The creature closes in on Jenkins Jenkins sees Hartley rising
from the floor next to the bomb Hartley shows Jenkins her
empty clip showing him she is out of ammunition

JENKINS
Hartley The bomb Shoot the bomb

The Leader stops and turns back towards Hartley She looks at
Jenkins not understanding Jenkins looks her in the eye and

screams

JENKINS (CONTD)
The Dead Mans hand Remember

Hartley nods in understanding and points her gun at the
device The timer is at 59 58

The creature screams at Hartley

LEADER
No Do not damage the device

The Being Leader runs at Hartley with full speed Jenkins
screams at Hartley

JENKINS
Now Hartley

Hartley drops her gun and pushes the nuclear device still
attached to the torpedo chains above as hard a she can The
device travels fast across the pulleys towards the torpedo
tubes and directly towards Jenkins

The Leader howls as the device passes him the other way The
Leader turns and runs towards Jenkins and the torpedo tubes

LEADER
Give me that weapon slave Obey
your Master

Jenkins grabs the device and quickly unhinges it from the
chains and pulleys He tosses the device in to the open
torpedo tube The Leader jumps in to the open tube chasing
after the device

As the Leader dives into the tube to retrieve the nuke
Jenkins and Hartley slam the tube door behind him spinning
the wheel and locking him in Jenkins turns to Hartley

JENKINS
Fill the tubes - quickly We dont
have much time

Hartley rushes to the torpedo firing console pushing buttons
We see through a small window on the torpedo tube door as the
tube fills with water We hear the roar of the Leader from
within the torpedo tube

Jenkins stands above the red firing button and looks back at
the tube Hartley raises her hand to Jenkins signaling the
the tube is full The Leaders eyes open wide with horror and
recognition as he realizes that he has been tricked Jenkins
stands at the launch button and looks back towards the tube

JENKINS (CONTD)
Master this bitch

The Being Leader screams as Jenkins hits the button There is
a huge thrusting sound as the Leader and the nuclear bomb are
shot out the torpedo tube into the ocean

EXT COPLEY UNDERWATER - NIGHT
We see the COPLEY from a some distance away We notice a small
figure being shot out from the main torpedo tube of the

submarine

The figure flies though the icy waters underneath the ice that
covers the ocean above them
The force of the torpedo tube send the Leader and the bomb
hurtling for hundreds of yards perhaps a mile into the dark
of the ocean until we lose sight of them Seconds later a
bright light is seen as the bomb detonates

EXT ROSS ICE SHELF - NIGHT

We see a massive sheet of white ice as far as the eye an see
Suddenly we see and hear an enormous explosion as a huge
plume of water shoots up from underneath and fills the screen

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM - NIGHT

Jenkins and Hartley are thrown off their feet as the entire
ship moves and vibrates Seals break and water flows and leak
all over the compartment The COPLEY shudders under the
pressure of the water the bomb has created

EXT COPLEY UNDERWATER - NIGHT

A huge pulsating wave of water slams into the COPLEY The
vessels hull groans at the enormous pressure

EXT COPLEY OUTSIDE - NIGHT

The Conning Tower raises out of the ice with a load groan and
crackle of ice as the wave hits the Copley and forces it up
and out of the water The submarine lifts slowly but
forcefully out of the water and ice until it is at nearly a
forty-five degree angle the front part of the vessel out of
the water entirely

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM - NIGHT

Jenkins holds onto Hartley as the torpedo room vibrates and
shudders violently

EXT COPLEY - NIGHT

The submarine slowly begins to lower back into the ocean as
the ice all around breaks The COPLEYs front end finally
crashes back into the water with a huge crash

INT COPLEY TORPEDO ROOM -NIGHT

The extreme movement begins to subside Slowly it stops The
water from the pipes begins to dry up and become just a
trickle Jenkins and Hartley fall down on their knees
breathing hard

Jenkins looks up at Hartley He smiles

JENKINS

Remind me never to play poker with
you You bluff too damn well

Hartley looks at Jenkins and smiles
EXT OCEAN AUSTRALIS - OUTSIDE DECK BRIDGE - DUSK

Jenkins is standing outside in the frigid air as the AUSTRALIS
heads for home His arm is in a sling and he is bandaged and
cut across his face

He stares serenely at the sunset Hartley walks out onto the
deck from the Bridge She is bruised and cut as well

HARTLEY
Well I made my report to the Navy
brass Theyll be sending another
sub down there with a replacement
crew to bring COPLEY and ENDEAVOUR
home The explosion melted the ice
around ENDEAVOUR and freed her
Thankfully the explosion was too
far away - because of the torpedo
shot- to thaw out Vostok or its two
miles of ice

JENKINS
And our friends under the ice

HARTLEY
I recommended shoving another bomb
down the drill hole just as
Danvers planned But this one would
just be a shitload bigger to kill
all those bastards underneath But
thats a decision above my pay
grade So for right know theyre
still trapped

She looks down at Jenkins broken arm and touches it
tenderly

HARTLEY (CONTD)
And how about you

Hartley looks into Jenkins eyes

HARTLEY (CONTD)
What are you going to do

Jenkins moves closer to Hartley the steam from their breaths
mingling in the frigid Antarctic air

JENKINS
Me Im going to sell this rig
take all my money from this mission
and move to some shack in the
Bahamas or Tahiti

Jenkins pulls Hartley closer his face next to hers

JENKINS (CONTD)
I hate the fucking cold

They kiss

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
