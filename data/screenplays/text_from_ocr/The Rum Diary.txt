based
a on the novel
by

Hunter -S Thompson

Screenplay by
Bruce Robinson
First Draft

March 2006
1 EXT HORIZON DAY 1

It is the year of our lord nineteen hundred and sixty
and the airways are soiled with a hit called Volare
Music to heave along with Mr DEAN MARTIN at the mike

In vigorous contrast weve got the view Nothing phony
about this Pink coral in reefs of clear water under a
seriously blue sky It could be a postcard from heaven

Volare oh oh

Right out there in the cloudless void a red speck comes
into picture Its a small biplane towing some kind of
banner But its way too far off the beach to identify

Cantare oh oh oh obh-

Suddenly the candycoloured plane skipping paradise is
all the picture there is It punches into frame close
enough to smell the exhaust I dont know how it happ-
ened but somehow the plane and song get into an audio
visual sinc our hearts borne aloft in aeronautical joy

2 INT POV PILOT AIRPLANE DAY 2

Sunlight flares into the cockpit as the pilot turns it
around Hes flying at about two hundred feet and DEAN
is on the breeze Sparkling ocean becomes stonewhite
sand and beyond is the big island You can see people
on the beaches and now their hotels Tower after tower
compete for space on the shore like one side of a zip

3 EXT POV FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BAY DAY 3

Its already clear what the plane is up to Hauling 30
yards of advertising it works the hotels tiresome as a
fly See it once and you get the message but the happy
sunbathers are required to see it again and again You
can read it from the beaches but not from here and no-
ones looking anyway not even the CAMERA Isolating a
concrete monstrosity it moves in towards an upper floor

4 INT BEDROOMBALCONY HIGHRISE HOTEL DAY 4

A room behind one of the balconies Night clings on and
curtains are still drawn Outside something passes with
the discretion of a freighttrain- A man on a bed moans
one EYE exploring the rudiments of vision It looks ‘like
a bullet hole The misuse of alcohol cant be ruled out

Theres chaos on the floor Clothes and books spill from
a suitcase plus compromised foodremains bent coathang-
ers and a portable typewriter Weaving a passage through
feet negotiate more paperbacks scattered newspapers ash-
trays and empty bottles The drone of an’approaching air-—
piane intensifies as the feet arrive at limegreen drapes

A curtain is drawn aside and beyond are the realities of
daylight A face looks out reacting unfavourably About
35 years old with an animal of a hangover It seems his
equilibrium took the brunt and as he steps onto the bal-
cony he must seek stability in the rail Tropical vistas
at either side and vertigo 15 floors down A SHOCKINGLY
RED PLANE becomes parallel with his vision It tows its
message up the beach PUERTO RICO WELCOMES UNION CARBIDE

5 INT BATHROOMBEDROOM HOTEL DAY 5

A mouth guzzles direct from a tap and now a face stares
back from the mirror Handsome despite the carnage and
nothing aspirin cant handle But never mind that His
face is plastered in some kind of evil grease that he de-
termines is lipstick But from whence did it come Was
there a woman in here Is she-still in the fucking bed
Relief she isnt is simultaneous with a ringing doorbell

KEMP
Who is it

Its roomservice and it says so KEMP gets it focused

leave it out there
Ill get to it

But the voice wants a signature The door gets opened on
a securitychain and KEMP looks suspiciously at a WAITER

What is it Is it eggs
WAITER

I dont know sir I
didnt order it

Whatever it is comes in on a trolley The WAITER sets up
places for two orders and KEMP swallows multiple aspirins

WAITER
You want some water with that

KEMP
Not right now

WAITER
Looks like you had a night

Is that what it looks like KEMP fights off an asprin gag
WAITER

Is someone joining you I
got two breakfasts here
-3-

5 Cond 5

KEMP
Thats OK she left
I1l eat them both

He Zippos a cigarette Menthol Kool and whips the lid
off eggs They look perfect But the WAITER is look-
ing at something else A small refrigerator minibar
is part of the debris Someone hauled it out and tried
to rifle it open No luck with coathangers and kicked
shit out of it KEMP is aware of the WAITERS interest

KEMP
(re fridge)
I intended to bring that
to the attention of a member
of staff I had some diff-
iculty getting it to open

WAITER
its the little key
on the door key

KEMP
Oh right -
(finds it)
I was looking for some nuts

The minibar is on its back On knees KEMP successfully
Opens it revealing a trove of miniature liquor bottles

I tend to avoid alcohol
(looking up)
When I can

Maybe time for a smile but theres a slamcut into titles
HOUND DOG TAYLOR and THE HOUSE ROCKERS hit it loud with in-
imitable blues This song is called The Sun is Shining

THE RUM DIARY

G INTEXT TAXIBOULEVARD SAN JUAN DAY 6

Slam right into the mouth of fat chrome Its the radiat-
or grill of a 53 De Soto And indeed the sun is shining
Flamboyant trees make it a pretty street But the houses
that once looked out onto beach now look out onto hotels

I dont like describing camera moves But this is track-
ing back in front of the cab until a cut takes us inside
Theres a DRIVER who looks like he needs sleep and a man
in the back behind a newspaper entitled The Daily News

DRIVER
Primero tiempo e San Juan

6 Cond 6

KEMP
I dont speak Spanish

So thats the end of that relationship Theres a sharp
change in KEMPS appearance Everything that needed it
got attention Hes showered and shaved and behind Ray-
Bans Shakes out a Kool and a Zippo momentarily flares

By now theyre speeding along a causeway A radiant sea
with occasional fishermen doing their thing All in all
the days shaping nicely and with a pocketful of miniat-
ures it might get even better He swallows one and con-
siders another Outside the landscape is changing into
suburbs of San Juan The taxi is moving but wouldnt be
anywhere else This is dog eat dog and screw the lights

7 INTEXT TAXISTREETS OLD SAN JUAN DAY 7
This part of town is picturesquely colonial what guide-
books describe as a Spanish Flavour You can barely see
for car exhaust but the DRIVER finally thinks hes there

KEMP
El News The Daily News

ShitEnglish and indifferent the DRIVER nods at a street

whats the matter with
going down it

DRIVER
Quatro cinco no change

KEMP has already slammed the door Abandoned and miffed
at the ripoff he pays the bastard and heads down a hill

8 EXT CALLE PLACE COLON SAN JUAN DAY 8

So many motorhorns in the city it takes a while to under-
stand why theyre concentrated here Traffic is blocked

in a honkingcacophony and Cops try to clear it Various
drivers have lost their rag and shout about it in Spanish

For reasons yet unknown a contingent of angry workmen are
protesting in the street If theyve got a placard they

wave it If theyve got a bugle they blow it Some have
rotten fruit and look for targets Clearly something has
made them very cross with the offices of THE DAILY NEWS

KEMP heads toward it but isnt associated with the build-
ing until he reaches its steps Suddenly hes converted
into some kind of Black Leg whatever that might be in
Spanish Doors are locked and he hits a bell Nothing
happens until a Cop arrives with a key Grapefruits and
mouldy lemons splatter glass doors as KEMP is allowed in
9 INT NEWS ROOM SECOND FLOOR DAILY NEWS DAY 9

Its a big room with all the usual paraphernalia of putt-
ing a newspaper together Virtually every cliche is evid-
ent typewriters telex machines and ceiling fans that

cant cope The air is almost blue with cancerous smoke

About a dozen desks in business and most are on the tele-
phone At one a Journalist hammers it into a typewriter
Got a phone clamped to his neck typing it as he hears it

KEMP
Im looking for Mr Lotterman

DONAVON
End of the room

He slams the carriage back and KEMP weaves through desks
The big room terminates in offices One with a very shut
door is evidently thé one KEMP was looking for Focusing
his act he taps on frosted glass and gets a frosty reply

VOICE Not now

The rebuff was unexpected but explained by a passing voice

SALA
Hes having the Friday Crisis

The voice belongs to a man behind glasses Cigar between
teeth he carries Kodacrome boxes with a cup of coffee bal-
anced on top Of indifferent age he needs shampoo and is
possibly in need of a rehab But despite the unlaundered
aura theres something attractive about him Dumping his
boxes onto a nearby desk he smiles across at the stranger

SALA
You Kemp
(affirmative)
He was expecting you yesterday

KEMP
We had some weather

SALA
Yeah I heard

A red light glows on a phone he heads for a coffeemaker

-- big snow in New York
Hes still on the call

KEMP

They already like each other The phonelight goes out
SALA

try another subservient knock

KEMP heads for the hot door Gets a last bit of advice

Dont notice the wig

10 INT LOTTERMANS OFFICENEWS ROOM DAY

The first thing you notice about LOTTERMAN is the wig or
rather toupee Its like a limp hat with an unfortunate
colour scheme Lifting a glance toward KEMP he gets back
to some heavyweight reading A red pencil is frequently
used Without interest in anything else he finds a voice

LOTTERMAN
If youre who I think you
are you better sit down

The instruction is followed and KEMP‘looks about LOTTER-
MAN is something out of the old school mid 60s striped
shirt and suspenders One or two things about his office
are worth pointing out Theres a big map of Puerto Rico
on a wall and crossed flags of the same country and USA
on his desk Behind him are windows looking out into the
street The protesters are raising volume and there is a
wail of distant sirens More editing with the red pencil
and eyes twist back with a reference to KEMPS sunglasses

LOTTERMAN
«» you find it a little
bright in here

KEMP
Id take them off but I
have a medical condition

LOTTERMAN
What dyou mean youre blind

KEMP
Conjunctivitis Sir

LOTTERMAN
The old ‘red eye

A slow fan swivels on his desk He tosses the edit aside

You arrive at a very trying
time Mr Kemp one of those
days stacking up So if you
dont mind well skip the
niceties and get right to it

KEMP
Its how I like to proceed

LOTTERMAN
(finds a file)

I was impressed by your CV
youve worked your way up
some interesting titles and
I like the fluent Spanish
The only thing that bothers
me about it is the bits that
are missing What happened
between St Louis and New York

KEMP
A time Im trying to forget

LOTTERMAN
How well are you doing

KEMP
Not so good

LOTTERMAN
Then Lets hear it

get back to journalism

LOTTERMAN
Why Puerto Rico

- KEMP
You know how it is when
youre starting over You
weigh up the jobs some
more possible than others

LOTTERMAN
I didnt think you were down
here to spite the Washington
Post this CV is a bunch
of bullshit youre either
overqualified or youre lying

The door flies open and in comes a man who doesnt need
to knock Hes SpanishAmerican and thatll do for now

SEGURRA
This is two days off the wire
(proffering a telex)
A day dead We dont have it

LOTTERMANs shallow sigh is a study in minimalistic fury

LOTTERMAN
whats the matter with
Moburg Hes about as

much use as a dug-up-—body

A resigned and bitter smile takes over There may be an
issue of bloodpressure SEGURRA and his telex are gone

The problem with this newspaper
Mr Kemp is that I am among many
who dont enjoy reading it We
have an ailing circulation and
I only have to look around this
building to understand why a

LOTTERMAN (cond)

lack of commitment and too much
self indulgence I got people
on salary here who come in like
guests on days like this I
feel like Im running the thing
on my own so Im looking for
some enthusiasm some energy
some fresh blood and the quest-
ion Im asking myself is how
much alcohol is usual in yours

KEMP
My fresh blood

LOTTERMAN
How much do you drink

KEMP
(weighing a shrug)
I suppose at the upper end of

social Im poised to give up

LOTTERMAN
Puerto Rico might not be the
best place on earth to do that

Is KEMP jittery with nerves Or jittery with withdrawal

Police sirens

Dont look so anxious Kemp I
wouldnt be paying for a hotel
if I hadnt already hired you
but this isnt the last chance
saloon and I got no place for
another heavy drinker which I-
perceive from the condition of
eyeballs behind the sunglasses
you might very well qualify as

are close now The vibe isnt comfortable

KEMP
this is a medicalcondition
Mr Lotterman I know it might

look like something else

LOTTERMAN
It looks like a fucking hangover

By now the SIRENS have arrived and LOTTERMAN is on feet
at the windows staring down into the street Satisfact-
ion at the view is obvious he beckons KEMP to share it

with appropriate humanity

He turns to KEMP with manic eyes their faces very close
Which side dyou dress Kemp

KEMP
I beg your pardon

LOTTERMAN
Politics

KEMP
I kind of hang in the middle

While the fracas continues LOTTERMAN discovers a cigar in
the ashtray Accepts a light from KEMP who Zippos a Kool

LOTTERMAN
This is a schitzoid society
(exuding smoke)

they got two languages two

flags two anthems and two loy-

alties we bring them stuff

they never had and they either
- hate it or want more of it

filled it with garbage Obviously a revenge attack Rot-
ten vegetables and fishparts erupt out over the sidewalk

seems the booze has finally registered and slumping back
he peddles an erratic course towards an horizon of stars

Fifty yards from the shore and nothing but lapping water
although if you bother you can just about hear the music

Too wasted to swim he snaps a Cointreau and for a moment
thinks hes hallucinating A VISION has arisen from the

blue as bluebells At a glance she looks entirely naked

20 INT BOWLING ALLEY SAN JUAN DAY 20

KEMP is hunched in the bowling alley like hes been watch-
ing the same ball travel a thousand miles P0OV of the
ball as it careers down the alley Pins disintegrate and
the machine resets them and a CHAMPION with a mountainous
gut punches the air in joy From time to time flashbulbs
pop But here comes another ball and the same thing happ-
ens over again This is the dictionary definition of the
word repetition Hell probably looks something like this
KEMP ‘
(taking notes)
what would you say you
like most about Puerto Rico

CHAMP
The alleys and the casinos
(his wife)
She likes the Duty Free

Both are dressed like 4 year olds shorts and ankle socks

WIFE
the more you spend
the more you save

Dialogue continues over a baleful montage Fat hands work
slotmachines faces in glee as they win Nothing is more
significant in their day than appearance of 3 RED CHERRIES

KEMP (0S)
have you seen a lot
of the island

CHAMP (0OS)
We never leave the hotel

WIFE It isnt safe

KEMP (0S)
But youre having fun

CHAMP (0S)
Oh yeah a lotta lotta fun

And back into the nightmare as another ball thunders down
the endless alley and fresh skittles shatter KEMP wears
a new white Panama that he tilts over eyés Seeks consol-
ation in a miniature overwhelmed by the crashing 10 pins

Is this another hallucination or a facet of fantasy real-

clutch of pristine bottles Rum flagons stand in waiting
and here comes the ball A galaxy of booze and glass exp-
lode in slowmotion as the ball delivers a perfect strike

designated as kitchen exercises the greatest pull Much

indulges a limited quality of life in the only example of
clean water Apart from an incongruous brand new spin
dryer for clothes everything else is comprehensively vile

Degradation expands to engulf the apartment made claust-
rophobic with photographs Most walls are plastered and
many are crimescene horrors Disturbing events are ubiq-
uitous a head in-a street catches Kemps eye The rest
is threadbare and thriftstore A pair of armchairs face
the only window though why this should be so isnt clear

Two rooms remain to be explored He heads for one when a
cockerel crows in another Was it a cockerel How can a
cockerel be up here KEMP pushes at a bedroom door The
bed was expected but not a bunch of cages on top of each
other wherein various live foul are resident One-or two
are swaddled head to foot in bandage like balls of string

radiogram and its stack of records Discovers something
of interest as SALA reappears wasted and dripping sweat

melee of excitement and shifting smoke its suddenly over
and SALAs cock has won Jubilation is shared with KEMP

- SALA
On a trade wind my boy

Money changes hands and like the Jiberos SALA administers
firstaid to the victor with his mouth sucking and spitt-

contenders The dirt is raked and a sign of the cross is
scratched into the floor A pinch of holydust is rubbed
into beaks of the combatants and tethers released Beady
eyes engage a paralysed stare provoking the first strike

you gave these guys the best
food on earth but kept ‘em
tied theyd ignore the food

precious birds more men and boys are on their way to the
fights Strictly a male affair the women and girls take
what meagre advantage they can with sad little stalls at

The trucks dump their load and gulls celebrate their arr-
ival KEMP peers across a wasteland of putrescence des-
poiling what was once a beautiful landscape City filth
stretches for as far as he cares to look But his inter-
est orientates around the immediate foreground The sub
poor live here in hulks of American cars Kids and dogs
and cooking fires in the ratlands To describe it as a
shanty would invest it with a status KEMP is genuinely
moved to discover such deprivation He takes the photo-
graph of an exquisite child living in a rusted Chevrolet

- the editorial policy of this
newspaper is owned by the Dream

And swooning violins like canned Mantovani dissolve into
a dazzling sea like it might be a dream Amongst the light
are a pair of silhouettes Naked in waistdeep water they
cling together her legs wound round his hips and her arms

around his neck Her head is thrown backwards and her hair
drenches the water like someone actually caught a Mermaid

37 EXT SEASCAPETERRACE BEACH HOUSE DAY 37

SANDERSON and CHENAULT are making love in the sea Nobody
should be looking and maybe KEMP wishes he wasnt But he
is and cant stop himself Clutching a bunch of flowers
hes obviously just arrived on the terrace A rush of em-
otions are instant embarrassment jealousy and fascinat-—
ion The latter momentarily insists and he watches trans-—
fixed although finally its jedlousy that turns him away

Retreating to the living room he looks about for anything
as good to look at Sees the encrusted tortoise and tells
it to scram His interest turns yet again to a tall brass
telescope on a tripod Maybe hell take just another peek

POV as the telescope comes into focus It briefly pass-
es the anchored yacht before discovering the lovers This
close its almost unbarable CHENAULT is reclining on the
ocean as SANDERSON givesit to her With arms outstretched
like wings she arches her back and KEMP is almost disabled
with lust Oh God dont do that How could you do that

Lascivious commentary continues as KEMP imposes his own em-
otional take on the proceedings Suddenly he jerks his eye
away and clutches his face Ah Ah Ah Its too much to
bear but too much to miss and he goes in for another view

SANDERSON stands naked on the yacht pulling CHENAULT out of

Sucked along in the wake of anger KEMP finds himself part
of the confrontation Two of the faces have already gone
but one remains to defy SANDERSON Hes a brutal looking
bastard in his 20s good looks spoiled by a deep scar on
his cheek Clearly this isnt simply about spying on the
Yanquis its about resentment at the whitemans presence

to meet the yacht in St Lucia Theres a lot of tan and
perfume about unlikable music on the stereo and conversat-—

delivering topups from a pitcher of white rum She wears
white heels and the kind of scant dress revered by wankers

Despite his entrapment in conversation shes a magnet for
KEMP He takes every opportunity to look at her And is
it a delusion that she seems just as often looking at him

The ZIMBURGERS are a pair of reactionary twats One uses
a grin and the other doesnt MRS ZIMBURGER has a budget
lift and lipstick on excessively white teeth She squats
next to an affluent looking suit with a dogcollar so we
can assume hes got something todo with a god ZIMBURGER
is wasted on rum and until CHENAULT arrives with more it
doesnt matter whether we hear the yelling bastard or not

meeting and incidentally you
dont worry about Lotterman

do with the New York Times

SANDERSON

MrKemp subs for a variety of
newspapers occasionally writes
for the News what he does in
his spare time is his affair

KEMP
Thats how I like it

SEGURRA
-- wed like you to do
some writing for us

KEMP
So I gather About what

SANDERSON

- in a sentence we wanna set
something up and have the pub-
lic as our friends And there
are various ways we can do that

(charm on auto)
- one of the easiest is to
throw a rock through their win-
dow then knock on the door and
sell them all a burglar alarm

KEMP
Im not certain I follow you

40 Cond 40

SANDERSON

Let me tell you how this kind
of thing works Paul Suppose
by way of example you wanted
to put up taxes by five percent
The smart way of doing it is
to float the idea of a ten per-
cent hike Let them all shout
about it get themselves in a
fuss Then you offer concess
ions how about seven percent
No way they will say Alright
lets stay friends and make a
compromise at five Bingo
they think they won something
and youve got the five percent
you wanted in the first place

SEGURRA
the same thing applies to
realestate You wanna build
five houses put in a plann-
ing application for fifty

KEMP
How many do you wanna build

SEGURRA
None
(gets to it)
We want to build one hotel

So whats the deal with that KEMP hardly bothers a shrug

KEMP
Looking around this place I
dont think anyonell notice

SEGURRA
It isnt in this place

SANDERSON
its an island sensitive

for a variety of reasons we
dont want to get into now

but we do need to start throw-
ing some rocks at it Nobody
wants a paradise choked with
hotels but everybody will be
pleased to compromise at one

SEGURRA
this is going to require
some clever writing in various

KEMP looks at faces looking at him it begins to look iffy

Isnt that kind of thing illegal

- my church will have a tele-
vision transmission facility on
the island so the question of
illegality is hardly appropriate

KEMP
Wheres the island

Discretion is paramount
if you join us youll
need to sign some papers

The door is already on the slide CHENAULT puts a smile in

bumping interspersed with threatening headlights Then the
big Ford overtakes and someone throws a jackhandle through
the Fiats windshield - Glass everywhere and SALA looses it

over of great significance Stiff from the beating and suff-
ering almost total dehydration he goes for the taps Gets a
gurgling in the pipes but no water Such a circumstance off-
ers scant debate and he all but drinks the goldfish bowl dry

Simultaneously an agonised plaint rents the air Mother of
Balls followed by SALA Like KEMP hes half dressed and
monumentally hungover but focused on a different priority

KEMP and SALA are back of the Buick on a rough country road
Every bump adds new dimension to KEMPs headache Plus the
DRIVER favours a station they hate but are too wasted to get
switched off Hats and shades and SALA has a stash of beer

KEMP

52 EXT JUNGLE ROAD MIDDLE OF NOWHERE DAY 52

The cab pulls away shifting interest to KEMP before passing
to SALA He moves towards the Fiat with escalating anxiety

SALA
What Fresh Hell is this

Things are bad but not as bad as they seem The valveradio
has gone as have both the doors Why anyone would steal the
doors off a Fiat 500 isa question without an answer Worse
is theft of the seats Both have vanished leaving fresh air
between the steering wheel and back seat This one has been
left but no doors and no seats make the car look undrivable

KEMP
Thats a riteoff isnt it

SALA takes affront at the suggestion The engine and wheels
are there All they need is something to sit on to drive it
back Before such details are confronted they need to make
sure it starts SALA gets in and tries kneeling to operate

the clutch This isnt going to work He reverses himself

like a surfboard With head and shoulders on the rear seat
he can just about get a foot on the clutch Notwithstanding
the hangover KEMP pushes and the engine splutters into life

KEMP
I sense disaster

SALA
you know what I
got a brilliant idea

53 EXT COUNTRY INTERSECTIONMAIN ROAD DAY 53

A truck passes heading for the city The Fiat pulls on to
the main road In any other automobile this wouldnt work
put the 500 is a very tiny car SALA sits on the back seat
with KEMP sitting on his lap By this means they are able
to progress like a normal vehicle As antidote to the mis-
sing windshield KEMP wears shades and SALAa snorkel mask

55 INT FIAT CONVERTIBLEBOULEVARD DAY 55

All in all this is going rather well Except it isnt stay-
ing that way A suspicious grating sound develops somewhere

KEMP
Whats that

SALA
- too much weight on the
axle try and sit forward

KEMP hunches closer to the steering wheeland SALA hangs on
like a pillion on a motorcycle A shift of weight has the
desired effect Less groan as they approach traffic lights

KEMP
Im gonna be late Im
gonna be a week late

Lights change and off they go again KEMP notices a subtle
change in the dynamic of his seating Slowly at first but
definitely happening SALA undulates like hes making love

KEMP
What are you doing Sala

SALA
I suddenly realise how
much I like you what
dyou mean what am I
doing theres some-
thing wrong with the axle

And with every yard its getting worse cranking SALA up and
down like the proverbial fiddlers elbow The Fiat is dying
and they would almost certainly abandon it were it not for a
black and white Police Cruiser that just appeared along side

From the police point of view theyve got a wrecked car with

no doors and men engaged in sexual deviance Via his snork-
elmask SALA recognises the face with the missing moustache

SALA
- oh my god its the
cop we set on fire

Any left takes them into a narrow deadend with an Everest

of steps the only way out Its a nochoice and they cant
stop anyway so down they go Pedestrians and washing lines
and expressions of sheer horror as they descend like tandem
pilots in a wingless plane Wipe out a cartload of melons
and more horror at more stairs SALA is still buggering as
six flights down they vanish through somebodys’ front door

56 EXT SHANTY TOWN CONSTRUCTION SITE DAY 56

A roadway full of garbage and stinking puddles At either
side is a shanty town of tinroofed shacks half naked kids
and starved dogs A taxi navigates potholes and pulls up

KEMP gets out looking considerably refurbished Buttondown
shirt and tie and a borrowed jacket Too late to hurry but
clearly late He pays the taxi and looks beyond the barbed
wire Towering above the slum (with more on the way) are a
clump of new buildings KEMP raises eyes to the top of one

lipstick CHENAULT radiates sex from the passenger seat -It
is an unequivocal reality like the big V8 throbbing under
KEMPs foot Power plus her pouting equals an intoxication

KEMP
Love this car
CHENAULT
Did he give it to you
KEMP
I wish its fast

Everything she does is like something to do with sex What
she just did was press in the cigarlighter and use it on a
pair of cigarettes Puts one in his mouth and he tastes the
lipstick He looks across and gets heat from the same lips

Which for all the world sounds like something involving his
dick A freeway sign happens to offer itself and KEMP goes
for it Im not into describing what the rush does to CHEN-
AULT but shes loving it and so is he 90100110 on the
clock and the Chevy hasnt finished yet Clouds of ominous
dust begin to mass in its wake and heres why This end of
the road is still under construction intermittent placards
urging caution 130 miles an hour and still some more to go
CHENAULTs breasts are pressed against her shirt in a fabul-
ous description Faster Faster as Mr Thompson once put
it Until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death

Flirting with CHENAULT is different to flirting with death
Out of road and the tyres are burning Parallel streaks of
rubber put down by the brakes The Chevy ploughs through a
bunch of woodchevrons and totals a sign advertising a skull
and crossbones It stops at deaths door Paralysed with
terror and exhilaration they stare without questioning who
will yell first spontaneously both scream at the same time

An echo sounds over a tropical valley and theyre literally
yards from a precipice When construction continues it will
feature a bridge across a gorge Meanwhile its a 300 foot
drop They have reached a DEAD END and a sign actually says
so It isnt clear whether the symbolism of this statement
registers for KEMP Quitting the Chevy both stare across an
unspoiled landscape a beautiful vista of sunlight and mist

Thomas wont you

Skilful manoeuvres from a wizened old bastard on the bridge
LAZARD makes him a proposition More starbursts as the en-
gine dies and LAZARD joins KEMPSALA in the well of the boat

LAZARD
he says you can have the
cabin but its ten dollars

KEMP
Ten dollars

LAZARD
Youll never get a hotel

“SALA
Where are you staying

LAZARD is running for a plane a cab already waits dockside
Pleased to meet you handshakes gives KEMP his business card

LAZARD
If ever youre in Miami

KEMP has torn and tossed the card overboard before the taxi
has vanished Dazzling fireworks and echoes of a steelband

Think we should check it out

Not tonight Tonight hes dead And so in reality is KEMP

80 INT CABIN OLD MOTOR LAUNCH NIGHT 80

Its cramped and stinking with a bunk either side KEMP is

already stretched on one under a dismal lightbulb Smokes a
cigar and yawns as he browses his paperback SALA excavates
stolen beer bottles from his camera bag Lines them up like
hes planning something and turns attention to his feet He
tugs shoes off and then socks judging them pessimistically

SALA
-» guess Ill get another
day out of the bastards
He offers a beer (declined) and stretches out with a bottle

Whats the book

KEMP
Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner
Rockets continue to explode Intermittent flashes of light

81 EXT PLAZA OLD TOWN SAINT THOMAS DAY 81

Carnival comes down like an explosion Trumpets on the cut
and the rest is colour and sunshine So many people in the
plaza you can barely move just go with the rhythm of pound-
ing steel drums Most of the faces are black but white Am-
ericans here and there in carnival hats Everyones in hats
and feathers and crazy paint and everyones swilling booze

Rum and music are everywhere conspiring to push the energy
Every sidewalk has its makeshift booze stall where violent
slugs are doled out in paper cups I dont know where KEMP
and SALA turned up but suddenly theyre inthe thick of it

A shot of rum costs 25 cents and BARMEN work feverishly to
supply demand KEMP’ pushes through and finally gets served
KEMP
Two rums two cups of ice

SALA
I thought youd given up

KEMP
I finally beat my will power

Happy grins as they hit them in one Shift themselves as a
truck hoots through Another steelband on the back of it’
with some juicy looking dancing girls dressed as pineapples

Maybe an hour later Maybe only minutes KEMP and SALA are
other side of the plaza dancing in a throng of people You
might call it dancing But in fact its a human snake shunt-
ing through the crowd in synchronised jive to the Salsa Band

Being drunk is the only requirement to join in and KEMP and
SALA are fully qualified By the time they find a way out
both are dripping with sweat and’ more booze is the antidote

SALA fixes it at the nearest stall KEMP points to a colon-
ial looking building across the square Its a sizable hot-
el and he wants a detour to change his shirt get a washup

SALA
Why

KEMP
-- coz I dont wanna stink
like you
82 INT GROUND FLOOR COLONIAL HOTEL DAY 82

A slightly more upmarket throng although almost as packed
as the street Lazy ceiling fans and Calypso Music upstairs
- 90 -
82 Cond 82

Considerably freshened clean shirt clean teeth and shaved
KEMP emerges from subterranean stairs dirty laundry confined
to his rucksack He looks about for Sala and gets the eye
from various quarters A lot of talent in respect’ of ladies
and if you cared to you could fuck yourself billious Foll-
owing the music he pushes up a staircase towards another bar

83 INT UPSTAIRS BARBALCONY HOTEL DAY 83

Just as loud in here but less people It doesnt take long
to find SALA Hes propping the bar with a couple of Girls
one with a guitar slung across her back Introductions are
made but KEMP doesnt really hear Rosy is a singer No
beauty but better than a kick in the balls KEMP gets rum
instead of a handshake and makes his way towards the balcony

From here you can see right across the square Its an an-
archy of madness and’ colour and youd have to be real lucky
to single anyone out KEMP just got lucky Can it really

be her She vanishes momentarily behind a phalanx of faces
arms waving above her head as she sways with the music He
waits and stares and she turns Its definitely CHENAULT

84 EXT PLAZA DAY 84

KEMP shoves his way through the insanity SALA behind hold-
ing ROSYs hand They cant find Chenault and SALA doesnt
care Yakking in Spanish hes persuaded to escort his date
to a dance hall A rendezvous is agreed and KEMP pushes on

One of the coolest spots to dance is under the fountain A
breeze puts haze in the air And there she is shirt stuck
to her breasts and focus of much attention as she flaunts it
for the local boys All want to dance real close and many
do But then she sees KEMP embracing him like a lost love

KEMP
Wheres Hal

CHENAULT
Boat I was here with
my girlfriend lost her

Half drunk and totally happy shes pleased to get led away

85 INT DANCE HALL DAY 85

Those that can do it Tango those that cant try SALA pas-
ses like an audition for Groucho Marx But the room is too
animated to notice much less to criticise CHENAULT cant
resist and screw the protests KEMP is coerced to the floor

Tight red skirt highheeled sandals a tango of sorts gets
danced They orbit each other high as kites She snuggles

86 EXT STONE STAIRWAY OLD TOWNHARBOUR DAY 86

Ancient steps find a way through crooked houses CHENAULT

leads descent towards the port Apart from the white South
African Girl all are more or less drunk KEMP may already
have misgivings but SALA and ROSY plus guitar are too in-
volved to notice The stairs finally arrive at a quayside

Anybody whos been to St Tropez will get the picture This
is where the money docks Sloops and upmarket yachts from
Miami and Bermuda sport French British and American flags

The rich are showing off their wealth and CHENAULT seems fam-
iliar with not a few Wavesto various faces taking sun and
champagne on their decks Meanwhile an alfresco restaurant
is being set up on the quay to feed the maritime bourgeoisie

KEMP
Is this a good idea

CHENAULT
Hes in happy mode

87 EXT SANDERSONS YACHT HARBOUR DAY 87

Like walking the plank in reverse they invade a small drinks
party If SANDERSON was in happymode it may just have chan-
ged But ever the diplomat he keeps it to himself Several
recognisable faces among the introductions SEGURRA and his
pretty lady and REVEREND HOLE in swimming shorts who has a
ring of ‘tan deprived pure white skin around his neck where
the dogcollar is usually worn CHENAULT doesnt understand
the atmospheric and pours her new pals champagne SANDERSON
however escorts KEMP to the bows for a discreet word or two

SANDERSON
Gid you take Sala to
the island
(no answer)
you shouldnt have done

a confidentiality agreement

SANDERSON (cond)

Or in other words whats KEMP doing here Before they can
get into it there is an interruption Brash tooting announ-
ces the arrival of a Bentley Convertible Its driven by a
50 year old pissartist with a racy young thing at his side
More money than brains he stands in his seat to wave roses
and champagne Clearly they are friends SANDERSON expected

SANDERSON

KEMP
If you want us to leave

DIGBY and his sexy little lady are already on the gangplank

‘SANDERSON

88 EXT SANDERSONS YACHT DUSK 88

ROSY plays her guitar a sad song of the people and shes
actually very good Dead champagne bottles upended in the
icebuckets a lot of booze gone down Sun going down too
at end of the day and beginning of the evening SANDERSON
and some of his guests are apparently below taking a siesta

REVEREND HOLE SEGURRAs WIFE DIGBY and his LADY are still
on deck plus CHENAULT and KEMP Hes in love with her and
shes unobtainable With ROSY still singing he gets up and
drifts to the bow of the boat SALA is crashed on the deck
in inebriated sleep KEMP stares across reflections of the
harbour watching the onslaught of another enormous sunset

He doesnt need to look back to know CHENAULT is looking at

him But you need better cards for that kind of game ROSY
finishes her ballad andnow you can hear music from the bars
The waterfront is waking mysterious hotels with red and yel-
low lights and people heading for parties aboard the yachts

CHENAULT
not going glum on us
are you
A sensual touch of finger tips he had no idea she was there

KEMP
Just thoughts

CHENAULT
Tell me one

He nearly kisses her again Or is it she that nearly kisses
him The moment becomes academic as SANDERSON appears from
below Gucci shoes with no socks all silk suit and cologne

SANDERSON
- Chenault would you

CHENAULT

Regge Band pound it out with no exits The ambiance is so
loud and so dynamic youre either a part of it or youre in
the street At some point it may be noticed that KEMP and
his gang are the only white faces But that isnt necessar-
ily important At least not yet The Band are at the end
of their set Much rum and black faces in blue light Not
entirely to SANDERSONs taste But everybody happy to meet
Rosys Brother and he gets preferential service at the bar

SALA
You want rum or beer

CHENAULT
Both

Everything in closeup because theres no other way of see-
ing You can smell the dope even if you dont know what it
is Even DIGBY is a part of the energy although SANDERSON
probably fakes it Whistles and claps as the lineup chang-
es Star turn is a rather different outfit Thunder stabs
from an electric guitar Two hundred mouths yell encourage-—
ment as they snap in the jacks put out shocks of feedback

Once again I refer to HOUND DOG TAYLOR His is the kind of
music I want A real friendly face with a Strat and a grin
hits a slug from his onstage bottle You alright You
alright Sure theyre alright Two hundred faces alright

Adrenaline out of a raw guitar Caribbean turned into black
rock and roll Walls of black muscle put eyes on the little
white girls CHENAULT and her GIRLFRIEND are riding cloud 9

Kitchen Sink Boogie or something similar Rock like its
coming out of the floor The whole room is busted but SAND—
ERSON becomes an observer Look at this guy dancing behind
his girl with hands inside her blouse Black Angel with red
lipstick Almost fucking her Its all over for DIGBY and

he drags his sweltering LADY out Has to shout to get heard
OK theyre leaving SANDERSON is leaving CHENAULT isnt

SANDERSON

He grabs her wrist but she isnt having it Just the begin-
ning of something tense If he wants to go thats OK but
she wants to dance A whole bunch of blueblack faces dance
around her Her fuses are blown and SANDERSON moves on KEMP

skirt Pretty legs and bitch guitar You alright You
alright You dont know where else to look because nothing
is happening but HOUND DOG and CHENAULT strutting her stuff

The rhythm is repetitive Insistent Hear it once and you
understand whats developing CHENAULT is becoming more pro-
vocative and outrageous and people are making space for her

A variety of partners evolve into one Hes a powerful look-
ing BLACK STUD sleek with muscle Dancing close to CHENAULT
she mirrors his sexuality like its some kind of competition

Do it like that Clapping hands encourage the excitement
CHENAULT hardly needs it Promiscuity like a narcotic She
seems as mesmerised by the music as by the man Its a dif-
ficult arena to invade and when KEMP attempts it the respon-
se is predictable He shouts to get heard but its just an-
other voice He tries to grab her but gets grabbed himself
shes dancin man

incidentally this is

my finger in your face

It points him backwards Like how about the exit “By now
a sweltering wall has formed around the dancers CHENAULT
and her PARTNER are the only show in town Shes advertis-
ing and he wants it Unbuttons his shirt and hauls it off
and now its her turn Wild applause as she opens’ her top

Beautiful breasts in a chicsilk brassiere Its a hardon

for everyone but SANDERSON This is every mans bad dream’
The greater her sensuality the greater his rage and great-
er the promise of violence He shouts but she doesnt hear
CHENAULT has completely lost the plot Arms above her head
she puts out while her paramour raises the hem of her dress

Do it like that Do it like that

Shes doing it like they want it and they clamber tables for
a better view Her exquisite dress becomes a lascivious ex-
periment She teases him to raise it higher and soon there
is nothing between her highheels and panties but legs He

lifts the dress right over her head and the music wants more
Everyone wants more wants her naked maybe she wants it too

There may be worse places to get into a fight but its hard
to imagine one The dynamic is so overwound its going to

snap and when it does SANDERSON tastes the blood Blood all
over his whitesilk suit You dont want to get hit by this
guy twice and count yourself lucky to be leaving here alive

Venomous eyes and supremelybad vibes The dilemma belongs
to KEMP Hes got to get SANDERSON out before he kills some-
one (or more likely) someone kills him But more than that
hes got to extract CHENAULT without getting killed himself

Midway through the crowd SANDERSON refreaks He lashes out
and hands that try to restrain him rip shit out of his suit
Hes going crazy One welcome face emerges from the fracas
SALA is among many who struggle to get SANDERSON out KEMP
pushes back into a nightmare And if anything it got worse

You might just see the blade just a flash in flashing light
It comes out of the frenzy deftly severing the back of CHEN-
AULTS bra Straps slip off her shoulders for a moment she
clasps it to her breasts Brute carnality that no one could
stop Not her Not anybody And that means you white man

The vibes couldnt be more dangerous Last thing KEMP sees
is the brassiere held in the air then kissed by her partner

brothers ended bad One of the sleeves hangs off his suit
and the rest is dirt and blood SALA says They called a
cab Any attempt to get him on feet is aggressively rejec-
ted SANDERSON wants no help from KEMP Here comes the cab
and somehow he gets bundled in and somebody slams the door

Music from the club is drowned in a roar Maybe theyre al-
ready fucking her Tail lights vanish down the hill Pand-
emonium inside and KEMP climbs steps to confront it But I
dont think so and neither do faces top of the stairs He
gets jive from the man in the hat and this place is closed

Enormous closeup of an eye Drip Drip Drip The liquid

I can help them with that Its called Lysergic Acid Dieth-
ylamide Tartrate In a year or two it will be known as LSD

Candlelight separates KEMP and SALA They share a constant
reciprocity of anticipation Anyone familiar with LSD will
know that fuckall happens until something actually happens
They are not familiar with LSD and dont know what itll be

Bullshit or not theres something quite extraordinary about
that rain running down the window It seems extraordinarily
liquid and KEMP abandons binoculars to look at it A weird
illusion Its just rivulets of rain But its glistening

served Everything requires a closeup SALA opens a beer

KEMP lights a cigarette and thats important too The Zippo
needs a closeup to fully cover the event Fire escapes the
flint like an F16 taking off Inhalation makes the end of
his cigarette very red He tosses the pack on the table and
watches it land For some occult reason it seems to have a
significance He stares at SALA still nothing is happening

KEMP
You feel anything-

KEMP blows smokerings Looks at rain on the windows Sil-
ver rain trickles down and in its way is curiously beautiful
He might wonder why hed never noticed that before But it
rarely rains so why should he and anyway his attention has
switched to the GOLDFISH Like everything else it requires

a closeup and then somewhat weirdly its own point of view

POV GOLDFISH It stares out via its fisheye lens from
one world to another Watches KEMP and SALA peering at each
other in the yellow light Maybe only the Fish can hear the
Music Without music this alchemy cant be happening Its
called Col Legno by an American named RALPH TOWNER His
composition features nothing but a double bass and drum It
results in a sublime mix of expectation and menace Similar
sentiments attend KEMP and SALA Theyve taken the most pow-
erful substance on planet earth and the bastard just cut in

No way do I try and describe the mechanics of this sequence
with a typewriter Only a camera can tell the tale Dont
ask how but both MUSIC and FISHEYELENS have quit the bowl
and are out in the room The fisheye doesnt survive long
but the MUSIC intensifies and begins to own the environment

This isnt going to be an entirely pleasant introduction to
LSD What you might call variable They stare from oppos-
ite chairs Everything looks normal but it isnt A Cock
Crows thrice and the MUSIC comes into its own It cant
be stressed enough that without this sinister rhapsody noth-
ing can be envisaged The Double Bass is resonant with mal-
ign promise KEMP knows something AWFUL is going to happen

SALA smiles and thats precisely it Its HORRIBLE like a
wound A surge of putrescent adrenaline creases KEMP - He
needs to tell SALA he doesnt like the smile but something
about it has wiped out his ability to criticise What can
be done if everything is SLOWMOTION muscles cant work at
this depth The swine SMILES again flopping out a TONGUE

It protrudes but an inch waggling from side to side in im-
itation of THE VIPER Is this an hallucination It cannot
be its HAPPENING Suddenly the most godawful rasp emits
from the Bass like a fucked hinge on the back gate of hell

approaches he pushes back in his chair like a man on a crash-

Here it comes towards him probing forth ever extending as

browned at the root from three and a half million cigarettes

At twelve feet it seems to have reached some fearful zenith
