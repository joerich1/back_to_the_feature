TEASER
Moving through the 0” of the “LOST” TITLE POP IN on -

A SINGLE CLOSED EYE AND IT FLIES OPEN But this time it’s
not Jacks It’s

THE MARSHAL
Shes dangerous

PULL BACK to find --
EXT BEACH - MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - AFTERNOON (DAY 2) 1

JACK and THE MARSHAL Feels like a couple hours have passed -
Sky’s a little darker and UNCONSCIOUS HURLEY noticeably gone

Jack looks up from the makeshift SUTURES he’s performing on
his patient’s abdomen The Marshals eyes flicker --
mumbling -- incoherent - OUT OF IT --

THE MARSHAL
-» have to find her

Jack continues to stitch Focused --

JACK
Try not to move man

THE MARSHAL
have to bring her back

Jack keeps stitching talks to himself --

JACK

Yeah you keep saying that but
every time I ask you who you have
to bring back you pass out again
And since your fever’s running
pretty high and I’m guessing you
have no idea what the hell you’re
talking about

THE MARSHAL
The cuffs where are the cuffs

And THAT gets Jack’s attention Stops what he’s doing --

JACK
What

THE MARSHAL
Jacket pocket

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 2

JACK THE MARSHAL
I don’t
-- Jacket Pocket

Jack turns -- Sees the MARSHAL’S SUIT JACKET folded on the
sand a few feet away Oh That

Jack unfolds the jacket Checks the outer pocket Just a
BOARDING PASS Reaches into the inside pocket

Pulls out a FOLDED PAPER And were TIGHTENING NOW as -
Jack unfolds the paper Looks at it Blinks

And SO FUCKING MUCH is going through his head right now --
thousands of emotions -- but it LOOKS something like this --

CONFUSION Then REVELATION And finally BETRAYAL And we
CIRCLE AROUND BEHIND HIM to look at what the hell is ON that
piece of paper And of course it’s --

KATE

Just her face Sad but defiant Maybe a little younger
than she is now but not by much At the bottom of this
photo a NUMBERED PLACARD Her name is not listed Nor is
her crime But make no mistake about it --

This is her MUG SHOT

And a final whisper as his eyes flicker closed --

THE MARSHAL (CONT’D)
- dangerous

SMASH CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON 2
A PAIR OF WORN BOOT HEELS being DRAGGED through the dirt --

We‘re moving really fucking fast hand-held
disorienting sound of HEAVY BREATHING EXERTION

And OH SHIT those boots are on the feet of a BODY

And KATE’s the one dragging it

She’s sweaty -- banged up -- clutching the wrists of this
bloody-faced MAN as she PULLS him up A GRASSY INCLINE

And Kate GRITS her teeth her toned arms BURN with the effort
but he’s DEAD WEIGHT and it’s hard and --

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 3

The bodys ARM comes off What

But Kate ain’t bothered by this She pulls the arm free of
the SHIRT SLEEVE tosses the ARM aside (a prosthetic) --
Bends over gets a grip on the bodys OVERALLS and --

TUGS IT UP THE INCLINE

And the ground finally levels out each step backwards a
Herculean effort as she turns to look over her shoulder as --

HOCOOCOOCOOOOOCOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNDNK

A HUGE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER -- a SEMI TRUCK -- passes within
INCHES of Kate’s FACE and we PULL BACK to find her --

RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF A HIGHWAY Smack dab in the middle of
CIVILIZATION -- across the street a BILLBOARD And just as
were wondering exactly WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON --

VOICE (0S)
Watch out

KATE turns abruptly as --
EXT HILLSIDE - THE ISLAND - DUSK 3

CHARLIE reaches out grabs her shoulder as she almost SLIPS
down the same STEEP INCLINE they came up

Ah That was obviously a FLASHBACK

CHARLIE
You all right

KATE
Yeah Thanks

And now we see the rest of the group SAYID BOONE
SHANNON SAWYER

BOONE
Getting dark

SAWYER
Then pick up the pace

BOONE SAWYER
Hick
-- Little louder

They’ve reached an OPEN SPACE A few more steps and they’re
in the JUNGLE Sayid stops looks to the DARKENING SKY --
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 4

SAYID
We should make camp

SHANNON
What Here

Kate and Charlie exchange a knowing look at the thought of
entering the JUNGLE

SAWYER
I‘m not stopping Y’all have a
nice cookout

SAYID SAWYER
Excellent Walk through the
jungle in the dark -- Ooooh You think the

trees are gonna get us

SAYID
No What is knocking down the
trees will get you

Sawyer reaches to the back of his jeans pulls out the GUN --

SAWYER
You’re so worried about me how
about you give me the clip back

Sayid looks down to the MAGAZINE CLIP tucked into his pocket
Already shaking his head as the debate is silenced by --

KATE

Put your gun back in your pants
Sawyer

(he grins but does it)
Sayid is right We need to stop
put the mountain at our back so
were protected on one side If
you keep walking you won’t make it
to the beach

SAWYER
Yeah Why’s that

And she doesn’t look away Has ALL their attention now

KATE
Trust me

And as the IRONY of that statement rings in ovr ears

END OF TEASER

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 5

ACT ONE
EXT MEADOW - EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - NIGHT 4

THWUMP A large ROCK lands in the grass lit only by the
soft orange light of a CAMPFIRE

SAYID (0S)
This is Australia

A LONG STICK pokes into frame - OPEN FLAME dances on the end

SAYID (0S) (CONTD)
This is us

SAWYER (0S)
Great stick

PULL BACK to see NIGHT is upon us Our GROUP OF SIX is
gathered around a CAMPFIRE Based on what Sayid just said
we intuit that Kate and Charlie have filled the rest in on
their journey to the jungle and thusly

From here on out when referring to these six as a group
well just call them THE KNOWERS

Sayid holds the STICK as he literally MAPS IT OUT for those
unfortunate enough to have missed the last two episodes --

SAYID

Two days ago we take off from
Sydney We fly along the same
northeast route every commercial
airliner bound for Los Angeles
does The Pilot -- before he died
from his injuries he said he lost
communication with the ground yes

KATE
Yeah About six hours in He
turned around headed for Fiji

Charlie pulls off one of his SNEAKERS -- tosses it to Sayid
CHARLIE
Fiji
Sayid drops the sneaker off to the right of the ROCK Alters
the course of the stick towards it

SAYID
So we changed course Regrettably
no one knew we changed course
(MORE )
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 6

SAYID (CONTD)
It was perhaps another twenty
minutes when the turbulence hit

BOONE
Turbulence doesn’t bring down
planes

SHANNON

You would know

Boone smiles shakes his head Used to it And now Sayid is
holding the stick less steadily his hand SHAKING --

SAYID
The plane came apart We know the
rest

The stick angles downwards Descending lower lower and
-- TSSSSSS -- the FLAME SNUFFS out in the ground Somewhere
between the ROCK and CHARLIE’s SHOE --

SAYID (CONT’D)
So we are here

Lifts the stick passes it all the way over (and man it
seems A LOOOONG way) to the original FLIGHT PATH

SAYID (CONTD)
But they think we’re here

KATE
The pilot said we were a thousand
miles off course

SAYID
Maybe more

CHARLIE
But they’1l find us -- I mean
they’ve got satellites in space
that can take a picture of your
license plate

SAYID CHARLIE
If only we were all wearing
license plates -- Well aren’t you the

pessimist

SAYID
Basic Photography -- point and
shoot Satellites can shoot but
they must be told where to point

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 7

CHARLIE
Oh Right
(then)
Bollocks

Sawyer SNORTS His turn --

SAWYER
Uh hey -- hello Hi there
Okay really enjoyed the puppet
show Fantastic So we’re in the
middle of damned nowhere How
about we talk about the other

thing The transmission Abdul
picked up on his 1’il radio
Yknow where the French chick who

said what was it again Oh yeah --

EVERYONE IS DEAD And the

transmission’s been on a loop for --
(to Kate)

How long was it freckles

KATE
(fuck you)
Sixteen years

SAWYER
Right Let’s talk about that

Some unsettled glances Everyone waiting for someone ELSE to
come up with the answer Then --

BOONE
Well - we need to tell the others
when we get back

SHANNON CHARLIE
Tell them what You’re right Maybe
someone
BOONE (CONTD) SHANNON
What we heard -- You didn’t hear anything
I’m not a stupid translator --
SAYID
We‘re not going to tell them
anything
BOONE

What

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 8

SAYID

To relay what we heard without
fully understanding it will cause a
panic People don’t like questions
they do not have the answers to
We tell them what we know we take
away their hope And hope -

(trust me on this)
Is a very dangerous thing to lose

Kate speaks softly --

KATE
So we lie

Sayid nods And his logic can’t really be disputed ‘They

all exchange looks Shit -- Just like that theyve become

CONSPIRATORS

EXT BEACH - MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - NIGHT 5
HURLEY

Was it a dinosaur

BACK AT THE BEACH we find Jack and HURLEY putting up a
MAKESHIFT TENT around the now unconscious Marshal Obviously
in the midst of a similar conversation —-

JACK
It wasn’t a dinosaur

HURLEY
You said you didn’t see it

JACK
I didn’t

HURLEY
Then how do you know it wasn’t a
dinosaur

JACK
Because dinosaurs are extinct

HURLEY
Oh
(beat)
Yeah

Jack works on the tent (the deflated YELLOW EMERGENCY SLIDE
from the plane) as Hurley clocks the shallowly-breathing
Marshal --

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 9

HURLEY (CONT’D)
So what’s his story He looks
kinda dying

JACK
Hes not going to die

HURLEY JACK
But he’s yellow man
His wound is infected The
antibiotics will fight it
off

HURLEY JACK
What if they don’t
- Then his body shuts down
one piece at a time If his
abdomen goes rigid

HURLEY
He looks like he’s in pain

And were ON JACK This is something he’s already acutely
aware of And it weighs on him maybe for reasons were
not entirely aware of Lost in his own headspace --

JACK
Yeah

HURLEY
What’s this

Jack suddenly turns to see Hurley unfolding the PIECE OF
PAPER Shit -- where did he

HURLEY (CONT’D)
Wait - this is

And realization washes over Hurley’s face as he turns the MUG
SHOT around to show Jack --

HURLEY (CONTD)
Uh Dude

Jack takes the paper out of Hurley’s hand Folds it back up
stuffing it into his pocket as --

HURLEY (CONT’D)
What do you think she did

Beat

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 10

JACK
It’s none of my business

HURLEY JACK
She looks pretty hardcore
-- Hurley

HURLEY
She didn‘t say anything to you I
thought you guys were like tight

Maybe that lands for a second but Jack doesn’t let it show
Instead --

JACK
No She didn’t say anything

And as Jack returns his attention to The Marshal
EXT BEACH - NIGHT 6

Again small FIRES dot the area around the fuselage small
groups of our CASTAWAYS gathered around them We PICK UP --

WALT as he crosses the beach He’s wearing a BASEBALL CAP
carries something else in his hand but we don’t see it until
he reaches --

THE TREE LINE

The darkness of the JUNGLE overwhelming in the moonlight A
few more steps and Walt would DISAPPEAR Throws a quick
glance over his shoulder to make sure he’s alone Then he
removes the hat turns it over puts it on the ground

And now we see he’s carrying an AIRLINE MEAL Some Lasagna-
like substance As he starts SPOONING the food into the
overturned hat --

NOISE FROM THE JUNGLE Something coming Walt stiffens --

WALT
Vincent

Nothing Silence THEN --
JIN emerges STOPS Startled --
And a flash of EMBARRASSMENT as we see Jin is holding a ROLL

OF TOILET PAPER But he quickly covers as he sees what Walt
is doing IN KOREAN --

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 ll

JIN
Why are you wasting that food

Walt has no idea what he just said but--
WALT
(softly)
Its for my dog
And off this odd tableau --
EXT MEADOW - KNOWERS’ CAMPSITE - NIGHT 7

We find ourselves a couple miles inland on THE DYING EMBERS
of the Knowers’ campfire

And right now we’re focused on SAYID Sitting up his back
supported by his pack SLEEPING SOUNDLY

And a HAND is reaching towards his waistband Towards the

CLIP OF THE GUN

Slowly Carefully Delicately pinches the top of the clip
and begins to slide it out

SAYID
What the HEY

And the hand JERKS the clip out as Sayid wakes up --
SCRAMBLES to his feet as we reveal THE THIEF --

BOONE Huh

He SLAMS the clip into the GUN -- must’ve already lifted it
off Sawyer

And THE OTHERS wake up now freaked about the commotion

SAYID (CONT’D)
What are you doing

BOONE SAWYER
Standing guard
(nods to Kate)

You heard what they said is -- You took my gun off me
out there boy
SHANNON
Please -- You’ve never held a gun

You don’t even believe in guns
(to the others)
He goes on marches

LOST “Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 12

BOONE
I do not go on

SAYID SAWYER
Give it back to me
- Oh yeah Give Al Jazeera
the gun He‘’ll protect us

BOONE (CONT’D) CHARLIE
I‘ll keep the damn gun I think Al Jazeera is a
network

SHANNON
We should give it to her

And all the fighting stops as we realize that Shannon of
course is referring to KATE

CHARLIE
Yeah Kate should hold the gun

Kate just stands there Says nothing

SAYID
Fine with me
(looks to Boone)
Well

Boone doesn’t wanna give it up He’s amped But he’s also
OUTNUMBERED And Kate makes sense He turns the gun around
holds it out After a beat

Kate reaches out and takes it Looks at it And then her

eyes go STEELY as she stuffs it into the back of her jeans

And we MOVE IN REAL CLOSE ON HER as --

INTEXT BARN - AUSTRALIA MORNING - FLASHBACK 8
The business end of a SHOTGUN prods into --

KATE She’s curled up sleeping in the corner of what just
might be a SHEEP PEN SHOTGUN pokes her again and --

Kate’s eyes flicker open Instantly she’s awake Aware of
the gun as she sits up and sees --

A FARMER On the early side of fifty KIND FACE doesn’t
match the rifle This is RAY Australian accent --

RAY
Mornin’

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004

KATE
(guarded)

Morning

RAY
Youre sleeping in my sheep pen

KATE
Sorry

RAY
How’d you get here

KATE
Walked

RAY
Walked from where

KATE
Town

RAY

Nearest town’s fifteen kilometers

KATE
Guess that’s why I’m exhausted

Ray looks her over --

RAY
What’s your name

KATE
Annie

RAY

You hungry Annie

Kate seems surprised by this question But then she NODS

INT RAY’S FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - FLASHBACK

Kate sits in a modest KITCHEN eating from a huge mound of

SCRAMBLED EGGS Liberally rips off a huge PIECE OF BREAD

from the loaf in front of her

Ray seems to enjoy watching her stuff her face for a few

moments

Hard but with a smile --

RAY
So you wanna tell me why you’re
trespassing on my property

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004

KATE
I ran out of money

RAY
You’re American

KATE
Canadian

Kate continues eating And she’s so pat in her story we need

to note -- we have no idea what’s true and what ain’t

KATE (CONTD)
Graduated college figured I’d see
the world Australia was on the
top of my list so I hopped a
flight to Melbourne Don’t really
know anyone here so I decided to
walk for awhile See the country

RAY
Melbourne’s a hundred kilometers
from here

KATE
I like walking

RAY
And somehow you wandered onto my
farm

KATE
Like farms too

RAY
Know how to work one

Kate actually stops eating

KATE
Yeah

Ray nods Matter of fact --

RAY
Wife died eight months ago
Wednesday Left me too many chores
and a helluva mortgage

(beat)

You help me with the first one
Ill give you a decent wage and a
place to stay
Lost Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 15

We can actually see Kate mulling the offer Weighing all the
pros and cons Sizing this guy up Deciding right here and
now -- can she trust him Then --

KATE
Deal

She extends her hand across the table But Ray doesn’t
extend his That’s because

RAY
Im a lefty

He pushes up the sleeve of his right arm Knocks on it
Hollow PROSTHETIC

And as Ray extends his LEFT hand and Kate shakes it

We make the connection This sweet farmer -- this man who
has just taken Kate into his life --

Is going to end up getting dragged through the woods by her
EXT BEACH - MORNING (DAY 3) 10
AND ANOTHER DAY BEGINS ON THE ISLAND

We TRACK with Hurley as he RUNS (and he ain’t exactly a
gazelle folks) towards --

THE MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY TENT 11
Hurley bursts in instantly waking --

JACK Snapped out of his five minute cat nap as he keeps a
vigil at The Marshal’s side Jack looks up at Hurley --

HURLEY
They’re back

EXT BEACH - FUSELAGE - MORNING 12

ALL FORTY OF THE CASTAWAYS are gathered around THE KNOWERS
specifically SAYID Weve missed the introduction and drop
in right where it counts --

SAYID
The transceiver failed to pick up a
signal We weren’t able to send
out a call for help

And we see this news land in TWO ways --
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 16

FIRST on the KNOWERS as they officially commit to the lie
SECOND on EVERYONE ELSE We can FEEL it - they’re SCARED

SAYID (CONTD)
We are not giving up If we gather
electronic equipment -- your cell
phones laptops -- I can boost the
signal and we can try again

We catch a glimpse of LOCKE here listening to Sayid
Listening CLOSE as he studies the faces of the KNOWERS

SAYID (CONTD)
But this may take some time so for
now we should begin rationing our
remaining food If it rains again
we should set up tarps to collect
the water

And the other CASTAWAYS begin to nod given a sense of
purpose now - Sayid might call it HOPE -- he continues to
organize things but his voice becomes a dull hum in the
background as --

JACK approaches the group

And he could really care less what Sayid is saying No what
he cares about is --

KATE And as soon as she sees him she SMILES
And even though Jack denies himself this
Hes happy to see her too

Kate immediately peels away from the others moves to Jack
He waits for her to come to him

KATE
Hi

JACK
Hey

An awkward beat Both of them WAITING Then --

KATE
I need to tell you something

JACK
Okay
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 17

KATE
But we should
(neds to the others)
Wanna walk

JACK
Sure

SO THEY WALK She’s NERVOUS Shit -- he is too

KATE
I know you don’t know me -- we
don’t know each other But
(simple real)
I just need you to try to hear what
I’m telling you Okay

Jack nods He knows what’s coming And we can FEEL the
relief spreading through him He told himself he didn’t want
to know but he DOES because in some crazy kinda way he
really feels for this woman

JACK
Okay

They stop alone now Face to face Intimate A beat
Another beat And here it comes

KATE
We weren’t able to send out a
signal because there was another
signal blocking it

Well That wasn’t quite what he was expecting to hear

And as Kate continues we SIT on Jack as her words play OFF
SCREEN So much going on for him right now His deep
feelings of confusion and DISAPPOINTMENT compounded by the
implications of the French broadcast

KATE (0S8) (CONTD)
The other signal -- we heard it A
distress call from a French woman --
she said the others were dead
that something had killed all of
them that she was alone on the
island It’s been playing for
sixteen years We don’t know what
it means or what to do about it
so we decided not to tell anyone

(beat sincere)

But I wanted to tell you
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 18

Jack nods His brain fucking SCRAMBLED right now All he
can really manage is --

JACK
Anything else

KATE
(thinks then)
There was a polar bear

Jack just looks at her Kinda speechless
And this is when Kate notices the YELLOW TENT The same
place where she last left Jack tending to The Marshal She
somberly nods towards it --
KATE (CONT ’D)
How is he The man with the
shrapnel

She said it like she doesn’t even know the guy Damn

And we can feel something else in Jack now -- ANGER

JACK
Touch and go

KATE
Did he wake up

JACK
Just for a couple seconds during
the surgery

KATE
He say anything

Beat Then --

JACK
No

And Kate looks at him And Jack looks at her And we --

GO TO BLACK

END OF ACT ONE

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 19

ACT Two
EXT BEACH DAY 13

And it becomes instantly and obviously clear that we have
officially SHIFTED GEARS because -

People are DOING something The WAITING GAME is over They

haven‘t given up on rescue but they’re dealing with the
reality that it hasn’t come

So we pick up these QUICK POPS as we float along the beach
obviously most interested to check in first with --

JACK and HURLEY

Jack strides down the beach with purpose Hurley doing his
best to keep up --

HURLEY
Seo what’d she say

JACK
She didn’t say anything

HURLEY
But you told her you knew

Jack doesn’t say anything

HURLEY (CONTD)
Dude

JACK
I don’t know anything

HURLEY
Well you kinda know she’s in
that mug shot And that we found
some handcuffs And that guy keeps
mumbling “she’s dangerous” over and
over

JACK
Not my business Not my problem

Hurley can see that Jack is trying to convince himself of
this Ever the cheerleader Hurley jumps on the bandwagon --

HURLEY
Yeah You’re right Let Johnny
Fever take care of her when he gets
better
LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 20

JACK
He‘s not getting better unless I
get stronger antibiotics

HURLEY
The stuff I got from the luggage

JACK
Was for ear infections and foot
fungus

HURLEY
We looked through everything man

JACK
What about the luggage in the
overhead compartments

HURLEY

That’s inside the plane
JACK

Uh huh
HURLEY

But the bodies are in there And
they’re all dead

Jack just looks at him Hurley takes a moment realizes
where he’s going with this -- but Jack lets him off the hook

JACK
I can handle it Why don’t you
keep an eye on our guy

HURLEY
(so fucking relieved)
Great Yeah Love to On it
(beat)
You sure you’re cool
Jack STOPS walking Looks at whatever’s before him —-

JACK
Yeah I‘m cool

And as a far off PEAL OF THUNDER actually BRINGS THE CAMERA
AROUND to see over them and onto --

THE FUSELAGE And it is SPOOKY

We leave Jack and Hurley and PICK UP --

on the periphery of the beach Close enough to see the
others milling about Close enough to WATCH THEM

WALT
I thought you said it was called a
“bluff”

LOCKE
Bluffing Lying It’s all the
same in poker

WALT
Could you teach me

LOCKE
Sure

Walt thinks they’re talking about a GAME but Locke is
talking about THE KNOWERS So here’s the concept--

Right now he and WALT move through the BAMBOO FIELD

As Locke continues we now pick up INDIVIDUAL LONG LENS SHOTS
of THE KNOWERS in the distance Small MOS VIGNETTES as
Locke gives us the accompanying VOICE OVER --

LOCKE (V0) (CONT’D)
If you want to be a good poker
player you need to be able to spot
a liar And the only way to spot
a liar is to find their tell

We start on CHARLIE talking to Claire Panning down his arm
to his hand which clutches into a FIST Opens Closes

LOCKE (V0) (CONT’D)
Easiest tell is one someone makes
with their body They tense up
Curl their toes Make a fist

SHANNON and BOONE in the middle of one of their TIFFS Angrily
jawing at each other as they move down the beach --

LOCKE (V0) (CONT’D
Another amateur mistake -- Some
people get very defensive when
theyre lying even hostile

SAYID directs castaways to build RAIN TARPS

LOCKE (V0) (CONTD)
More experienced players use
distraction to keep your attention
off their cards

SAWYER sits off by himself completely isolated An unlit
cigarette dangles from his mouth

LOCKE (V0) (CONT’D)
Others avoid contact all together
When they catch a hand they
isolate themselves for fear of
being unable to hide the truth
(beat )
And some people

Finally settle on KATE Walking down the beach by herself
carrying TWO SUITCASES towards the growing pile

LOCKE (V0) (CONTD)
You just can’t read at all

AND WE COME BACK TO THE BAMBOO as Locke studies Kate
INTRIGUED by this woman for reasons he is not yet aware of

EXT BEACH - MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA DAY 15

Hurley emerges from the YELLOW TENT with a container of
water Almost runs headlong into KATE He SHOUTS STARTLED--

KATE
Hey -- Sorry

Hurley is instantly on edge -- He knows but she doesn’t know
he knows “Slick” is not part of his arsenal so even though
she didn’t ask --

HURLEY
I was just going to get some more
water
KATE
We haven’t met I’m Kate
HURLEY
Hi Kate Hurley
KATE
(okay)

I was looking for Jack -- thought
he might be inside there

HURLEY
Yeah No uh he’s getting some
medicine Over there --

Kate turns towards where Hurley is pointing -

And that’s when he sees the BUTT OF THE GUN sticking out of

her waistband
So when she turns back to him he is REALLY SHITTING Now

KATE
Where In the fuselage

HURLEY
(can’t meet her eyes)
What Oh Yeah in the uh
so I better get that water

And Hurley moves off -- can’t get out of there fast enough
Kate turns watching him --

And her eyes narrow Because she’s familiar with this vibe
Felt it many many MANY times before --

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 16

DARK And we’re MOVING QUIETLY someone stealthily enters
the same kitchen where we last saw --

KATE And here she is again Lightly puts a DUFFEL BAG on
the floor moving like a thief in the night as she --

Opens up one of the CABINETS Reaches into the WAY BACK --
And pulls out a CAMPBELL’S SOUP CAN Dips her fingers in --
REMOVES A WAD OF CASH That‘s when --

RAY Bank’d give you one heckuva toaster
you put that in a savings account

THE LIGHTS FLICK ON Kate looks up Money in her hand And
there’s Ray In his robe but wide awake

KATE
What do I need a toaster for

RAY
You’re hiding your wages in a tin
can I woulda held it for you
Annie

KATE
I have trust issues

And she’s NOT a thief this was her money And Kate actually
SMILES despite the incriminating position she’s in Ray
shakes his head but smiles back Nods towards the duffle —-

RAY
Weren’t gonna say goodbye

KATE
I wrote you a note

Ray nods A few beats Then --

RAY
You’ve been here almost three
months now Annie Every time I
asked you about yourself you got
that look in your eye
(she reacts)
Yeah That one

RAY (CONTD)
So I minded my own business
respected your secrets Figured
maybe you got on the wrong side of
a bad relationship maybe you
ran I always knew youd be
leaving here sooner or later
Guess I hoped you wouldn’t be doing
it in the middle of the night

And as stoic as Kate wants to be the strength in her eyes is
betrayed by the fact that they’re watering

KATE
I need to go Ray

RAY
Okay

KATE
I’m sorry

RAY
Yeah Me too
(beat)
How about you stay one more night
I‘ll drive you to the train station
in the morning Promise

Kate considers this Looks at him It’s hard for her for
reasons it‘ll take SEASONS to explain But finally

KATE
Okay

As she moves to pick up her duffle --

RAY
Annie

KATE
Yeah

RAY
I get it y’know

Everyone deserves a fresh start
And OFF KATE as the SOUND OF THUNDER BRINGS US BACK TO

THE SKIES CONTINUE TO DARKEN over the Fuselage And were
MOVING IN towards it Slowly Ominously

We’ve been avoiding it for three episodes now but it’s
finally time to GO --

INT FUSELAGE - DAY STORMY WEATHER 18
Inside

Eerily QUIET Grim Creepy We are AWARE of the death
around us without seeing it

Jack is on his hands and knees BANDANA tied over his face
Uses a tiny PEN-LIGHT as he POPS OPEN another OVERHEAD
COMPARTMENT (as the fuselage is upside-down it’s at GROUND
LEVEL) and removes a carry-on bag UNZIPS it as -

BANG

Jack’s head turns -- Shit Did he just hear BANG

Oh yeah Something is in here

Jack turns his puny LIGHT in the direction of the sound —-
just enough to get a fleeting glimpse of MOVEMENT

BANGBANG More movement And it’s gotta be one of the
bodies moving around and that is BIGTIME FUCKING SCARY as
Jack sits there motionless until

A MEGAWATT FLASHLIGHT BLASTS INTO HIS FACE

Jack covers his eyes from the brightness as the flashlight
slowly rotates up UNDERLIGHTS the grinning mug of --

SAWYER
Boo

Yup SAWYER is on the other side of the fuselage Jack
pulls down his bandana PISSED but COOL --

JACK
What are you doing in here

Sawyer holds up a practically OVERFLOWING BACKPACK Shakes
it The sound of BOTTLES OF BOOZE amongst the contents

SAWYER

JACK
You’re looting

SAWYER

ear)
Nope They’re cool

JACK

SAWYER

(laughs)
Brother you gotta wake up and
smell the gull crap here Rescue

time trying to save a guy who --
last time I checked -- had a piece
of metal the size of my head
stickin’ out of his bread basket
Lemme ask you -- How many a’ those
pills you gonna use to fix him up

JACK
As many as it takes

SAWYER
Yeah How many you got

Jacks eyes burn as he realizes there is a certain twisted
logic to what Sawyer is saying

And now the latter is pushing past daring him to physically
stop him from leaving the fuselage But before he goes --

INT INFIRMARY TENT - DAY - STORMY WEATHER 19

And as the first DROPS OF RAIN pitter-pat on the waterproof
slide that now forms this TENT we’re —-

CLOSE ON THE MARSHAL’S FACE A PROFILE

And he don’t look good at all Pale Sickly SWEATING
Struggling to breathe And we sit here with him for a few
moments Jacks in the fuselage so The Marshal is ALONE

And Kate leans INTO FRAME

Extremely close to The Marshals face Her eyes betray
nothing but the proximity is well INTIMATE as she
studies this man whose past is so intertwined with her own
CLOSER NOW If we didn’t know better wed almost think
she’s gonna kiss him And we watch this odd tableau Watch
Kate watch him Finally she whispers --

KATE
Can you hear me

A beat Another beat Then

The Marshals eyes FLY OPEN -- his hands already moving as he
GRABS KATE’S THROAT

Kate’s hands flail to pull him off but he’s already sitting
up And their eyes LOCK His burning with FEVER as hers
burn with LOSS OF OXYGEN

And as his GRIP tightens even further

END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE
And we SLAM out of the commercial break and find
INT INFIRMARY TENT - DAY - RAINSTORM 20

KATE EXACTLY WHERE WE LEFT HER - IN THE TIGHTLY CLOSING GRIP
OF THE MARSHAL

The Marshal is out of it PEVERISH but that doesn’t matter
because

He’s going to kill her

And that’s when JACK APPEARS

Happens FAST - Jack grabs The Marshal in a HEADLOCK -- drags
him off Kate and she -- PULLS AWAY GASPING for air - and
the fight leaves The Marshal as - HE COLLAPSES into Jack --

CRUMPLES TO THE SAND -- Jack ignores Kate as The Marshal
begins to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- A SEIZURE --

JACK
Dammit
Kate tries to catch her breath -- watches as Jack holds The
Marshal’s shoulders down -- all he can do right now and --

Finally The Marshal stops SHAKING A moment of CALM

And Jack looks up at Kate And Kate looks back at him AN
ALMOST EXCRUCIATINGLY LONG BEAT Sitting here Wondering
who’s gonna talk first because there’s so MUCH to say -

KATE
I was just checking to see how
(beat)
He just grabbed me

Another fucking lie Jack can’t deal with her Turns back
to The Marshal Checking the area around the wound —-

KATE (CONT’D)
How is --

And part of this is ANGER Part of it is SADNESS And part
of it a sense of his own FAILURE --

JACK
He’s not responding to the
antibiotics Hes septic --

(realizing it as he says
it)

And his abdomen is rigid which
means he’s gonna die

And Jack finally looks up at her and it almost looks like
he’s just OVERWHELMED -- for some reason saving this guy
Means that much to him

JACK (CONTD)
He needs water

He gets up grabs an empty PLASTIC JUG Pushes by Kate as he
moves out of the tent --

EXT BEACH - RAINSTORM - CONTINUOUS 21

The RAIN REALLY COMING DOWN NOW Jack oblivious to it as he
moves across the beach Kate tries to keep up with him both

She looks at him And there’s no mistaking what she’s trying
to say here And Jack knows what she means Where she’s
going with this

JACK
I‘m not a murderer

Well There it is

All the cards are on the table Jack knows Kate knows he
knows And it‘s sad and painful and REAL

A long moment of SILENCE between them -- SOAKING WET but
oblivious to the rain

And then Kate walks away And as Jack watches her go
WE RACK FOCUS to find --

stay dry And yeah

He heard the whole thing

branches like an OLYMPIC HURDLER

BLASTING through the brush of the dark jungle looking over
his shoulder as he finally --

EXPLODES out of the jungle to find himself --
IN A SECLUDED GROVE OF TREES 24

And he’s not alone SUN is here

And she’s naked from the waist up

In the act of washing herself And she’s so surprised to see
Michael that she doesn’t even move

And despite the fact that he was just running for his life
Michael is FROZEN dead in his tracks All he says is --

MICHAEL
Oh

An oddly beautiful MOMENT Awkward Intense And maybe a
little SEXY Michael looks back the way he came --

NOTHING THERE Feels silly for having overreacted as Sun
finally brings her arms up to cover her chest

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
(pointing to the jungle)
Uh something was uh chasing me
so you should --
(embarrassed)
I don’t hear it now but you should
probably head back

Michael reaches down Picks up Sun’s BLOUSE Averts his
eyes as he hands it to her Well aware of the language
barrier but still needing to say --

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
I didn’t see anything

And as Michael moves past her Sun turns to watch him go

by a single penetrating concept --

outside of the INFIRMARY TENT Echoing across —-

the intensity of the sounds of SUFFERING

Settles down next to Locke Jitters compounded by the fact
that we might suspect he’s HIGH right now

Locke looks up at Charlie Somewhat SYMPATHETIC And as
The Marshals MOANS seem to get louder we find --

MICHAEL and WALT

Walking across the beach And as they pass by SUN and JIN
she and Michael make eye contact for a quick moment

And just as we’re wondering whether or not Jin caught it
(cause he sure seemed to)

The eerie quiet continues to be shattered by THE DYING

And here far far away from the wreckage of the plane - and
more importantly the CRIES OF THE MARSHAL -- we find KATE

Building her own small campfire A quiet meditative
process Alone with her thoughts whatever they might be

She reaches into her pocket (and past the GUN reminding us
its there) pulls out a MATCHBOOK Flips it open Empty

Kate looks up to see SAWYER grinning that grin and flicking
the flint of his DISPOSABLE LIGHTER

be dealing with right now but she NODS

Sawyer tosses her the lighter She catches it As Kate goes
about sparking the KINDLING Sawyer settles down in the sand

ARM comes off -- She pulls the arm free tosses it aside —--
Bends over gets a grip on his OVERALLS and TUGS HIM UP THE
INCLINE -- Turns to look over her shoulder as —-

HOOOOCOOOOOOOOOOCOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNK

A HUGE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER - passes within INCHES of Kate’s FACE
and we PULL BACK to find her ON THE EDGE OF A HIGHWAY

A COUGH Kate looks down sees Ray STIR He’s OKAY

Andthats when Kate hears a CLICK

Lets go of Ray as she slowly turns around to see --
THE MARSHAL His gun pointed right between her eyes

THE MARSHAL

And as Kate stares defiantly at her CAPTOR

INT INFIRMARY TENT - NIGHT 34
Kate stares defiantly at her captor

Of course the context is a little different now Just the
two of them Here inside the tent She keeps her distance
arms crossed -- feeling oddly exposed

He lies on his death cot Still lucid but the PAIN of every
breath every word every motion it’s fucking PALPABLE

THE MARSHAL
So what was it

KATE
What

THE MARSHAL
The favor

KATE
I don’t know what you’re

THE MARSHAL
Last thing I heard you say --
Before the crash You wanted a

favor

KATE
Oh That

THE MARSHAL
Well

And before she answers we might notice the way these two
talk to each other A genuine shorthand A real HISTORY

KATE
I wanted you to make sure Ray
Mullen got his twenty-three grand

THE MARSHAL
What
(laughs through his pain)
The farmer who ratted you out

KATE
He had a helluva mortgage
THE MARSHAL
Gosh Katey -- you really are one

of a kind

His laughter turns into a COUGHING FIT Then --

MARSHAL
You know you would’ve gotten away
if you hadn’t gone back for him

KATE
Case you havent noticed I did get
away

THE MARSHAL
Yeah

(gives her the once over)
Dont look free to me

Kate nods Almost smiles And this moment is broken as The
Marshal WINCES grits his teeth in pain A beat Then —-

THE MARSHAL (CONT‘D)
It hurts Kate

Suddenly somber as he looks at her Oddly pathetic

THE MARSHAL (CONTD)
I’m gonna die right

And however she feels about this guy (and that’s a ball of
twine we ain’t gonna unravel tonight) she won’t lie to him --

KATE
Yeah

He nods Resigned to this Then --

THE MARSHAL
So are you gonna do it or what

Whoa OFF KATE

the distance

HURLEY
Yeah but she’s got that gun

Beat Okay Were SERIOUS now

JACK

HURLEY
She’s strapped man I saw it in --

But Jack is already RUNNING Leaves Hurley in his dust
FULL SPEED arms pumping - He can still STOP her --

And Jack is almost there but then he SEES something His
head WHIPS AROUND because it’s —-

Kate Several yards away from the tent She looks up at him
- eyes betray NOTHING -- and he looks back at her confused

BANG
And that would be the sound of a single GUNSHOT
And Kate just walks by Jack Her head down

JACK
Wait --

LOST Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 50

But she doesn’t wait She keeps walking And Jack turns
back towards the tent trying to make sense of this

Thats when someone emerges from the tent HOLY SHIT --
ITS SAWYER

Intense Not his normal wiseass self Got the GUN in his
hand He sees Jack surprised but OWNING IT

JACK (CONTD)
What did you do

SAWYER
What you couldn’t

And Jack is fucking FURIOUS --

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Look - I get where youre coming
from being a doctor and all but
people shouldnt have to listen to
aman cry like a dog for three
days And him He wanted it too
Asked for it So I don’t like it
anymore than you do but somethin’
had to be

And that’s when they hear a MOAN from the tent

SAWYER (CONTD)
What the hells that

And then another MOAN Louder More pained

Holy fucking shit -- The Marshal isn’t dead

Sawyer is FROZEN but Jack is already moving past him INTO --
INT INFIRMARY TENT - CONTINUOUS 36
FAST -- INTENSE - HAND-HELD

FRENZIED The Marshal is THRASHING AROUND --

Jack immediately gets to his knees to help the guy as Sawyer
enters the tent behind him --

JACK
You shot him in the chest

SAWYER
I was aiming for his heart
Lost Tabula Rasa (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 07122004 51

JACK
You missed

The Marshal CRIES OUT IN AGONY Jack GRABS whatever he can
to try to plug up the wound --

JACK (CONTD)
You perforated his lung it’ll
take hours to bleed out
Sawyer is FREAKING Looks down at the gun He’s fucked

SAWYER
There was I only had one bullet

But Jack turns around Levels him with a LOOK Rage

JACK
Get out

Sawyer stands there for a moment

And then he gets out

EXT MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY AREA - BEACH -— NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 37
The Marshal’s CRIES even LOUDER now as Sawyer emerges from
the tent -- Gets a safe distance away CURSING under his
breath as he fumbles for his cigarettes

Finally fishes one out but his hand is SHAKING SO FUCKING
HARD he can’t even light it -- finally throws it away

And we stay out here With Sawyer As he looks towards the
tent hoping that Jack will do something to clean up the mess
he just made

And we don’t want to go in there We don’t HAVE to

Because whatevers happening in that tent is going to STAY in
that tent And all we need to know is this --

After a few moments The Marshal stops screaming And all is
SILENT A seemingly endless beat passes Then --

Jack emerges from the tent Walks past Sawyer without so
much as looking at him

And disappears into the night

ACT FIVE
EXT BEACH - JUNGLE’S EDGE - DAWN (DAY 4) 38
The sky is the HAZY PURPLE OF DAWN as we come in on --

LOCKE He sits INDIAN-STYLE And he’s just blowing into that
whittled piece of BAMBOO No SOUND comes from it

And that’s when we hear a JINGLE Metal on metal Again
Closer now SOMETHING is coming

And it’s VINCENT The Labrador He comes to the edge of the
jungle Pauses Sizes up Locke Locke SMILES Blows into
the bamboo again and Vincent’s EARS perk up

Oh man This guy made a DOG WHISTLE
EXT BEACH — DAWN 39

CLOSE ON MICHAEL as he sleeps curled into his Lean-to as a
FINGER reaches in gently taps his shoulder

Michael‘’s eyes open to see Locke Crouched down beside him
Locke raises his finger to his lips then points to Walt
sleeping a few yards away Whispers --

LOCKE
I found your son’s dog
MICHAEL
What
LOCKE

Vincent Tethered him to a tree
just over there

(sincere)
I know Walt lost his mom Thought

dog back to him

Michael doesn’t know what to say So he settles for —-

all night And he has

Kate walks up Settles down next to him

And the two of them just sit there for a moment Watching
the sun come up Finally --

KATE
I want to tell you about what I
did Why he was after me

Jack considers this for a moment

JACK
I don’t want to know

KATE
(surprised)
Sorry

JACK
It doesn’t matter Kate

And as Jack speaks we may get the sense that he’s not really
talking about Kate at all --

JACK (CONTD)
Who we were what we did before

this -- before the crash -- it
doesn’t really
(beat)

Three days ago we all died
We should be able to start over

Kate likes the sound of this Looks at Jack with a newfound
respect Something deeper than before More real

KATE
Okay

JACK
Okay

Kate stands up Puts her hand on his shoulder tLooks like
she’s gonna say something --

But she doesn’t As she moves to go --

JACK (CONT’D)
Howd Sawyer get the gun

Kate considers this But says nothing Just a sad SMILE
Well Maybe it’s not gonna be so easy after all

After a moment Kate turns And walks away

EXT BEACH - EARLY MORNING - MONTAGE 41

And a PIECE OF MUSIC begins Something about moving on
Something UPLIFTING And that music is playing for an
audience of one -- HURLEY He sits on the beach wearing a
pair of MASSIVE HEADPHONES as he empties the SAND from his
socks And as weve spent the last hour feeling crappy it’s
time to get some moments of genuine human KINDNESS --

JIN

Watches Sun sleep under the shaded area of their LEAN-TO
Without waking her he gently brushes the hair from her face
and tucks it behind her ear

BOONE

Hands Shannon her Prada Sunglasses He FIXED THEM with a
small paperclip She puts them on actually smiles for the
first time since we’ve met her

SAYID

Walks past Sawyer and TOSSES him an apple Sayid smiles
keeps walking as Sawyer is shocked by the gesture --

CHARLIE

Rewraps the bandage around his pointer finger Changes the
F’ in “FATE” to an L”

CLAIRE

Runs her hand over her stomach smiling -- talking to her
unborn baby Telling him everything is going to be okay

WALT
Looks across the beach to see his father walking towards him

And at first Walt can’t believe his eyes -- but then it’s
clear VINCENT is with him And as Walt runs for the dog

THE MUSIC ENDS AND WE MOVE OFF THE BEACH FURTHER AWAY
TO A DISTANT POINT OF VIEW

As Walt is reunited with his dog And we PULL BACK to see

the person watching this reunion is LOCKE And whatevers
going on behind those intense eyes of his

It ain’t good

END OF SHOW
