INT — RING SLOW MOTION (LAS VEGAS) BLACK AND WHITE

The scene arises on a STARK GRACEFUL VISUAL of TWO BOXERS
engaged in combatthe dominant fighter known as MASON
‘THE LINE’ DIXON moves in for the kill His body language
is fluid and boxing skills are pure precision savagery

In EXTREME SLOW motion Dixon feints and throws A
THUNDEROUS BLOW that crashes with devastating results
against his opponent’s chin A surrendering towel is
tossed into the air as the challenger begins an
UNCONSCIOUS DESCENT TO THE CANVAS Dixon strides to his
corner ONE VICTORIOUS FIST held high The haunting scene
begins to melt away as an ascending chorus of boos filis
the arena

COMMENTATOR 1 (V0)
-This crowd is not holding back its
anger over this latest debacle

The SCREEN now transforms from BLACK AND WHITE INTO
SUBTLE COLOR

COMMENTATOR 2
»-In what has become an all too regular
occurrence Another inferior opponent
rendered unconscious

A LARGE CUP OF ICE is heaved from several rows back
SPRAYING Mason and his entourage Another CUP OP ICE
descends into the ring nearly hitting a member of Dixon’s
corner who stands behind the champion brazenly holding
the CHAMPIONSHIP BELT high over his head The camera work
grows increasingly aggressive matching the flustered
crowds attitude

COMMENTATOR 2 (CONTD)
Objects are being thrown into the ring

Cubes of ice hit DIXON

COMMENTATOR 1
---Another disappointing title defense
Something hit Dixon

An EMPTY BEER BOTTLE descends from high up in the
bleachers and crashes with lethal impact on the canvas
The twenty or so people in the ring panic shielding
their heads while frantically scanning the crowd The
booing increases

Dixon climbs through the ropes Then he pauses He glares
defiantly at the crowd
COMMENTATOR 1 (CONT’D)
The champ Mason Dixon is leaving - This
is a horrible scene Dixon wants no more
The crowd is growing more aggressive at
this lackluster event It was just a
matter of time before all Hell broke
loose

As the CREDITS ROLL we follow DIXON and his entourage out
of the arena followed by RABID JEERING

Over the chorus of insults the simple scene DISSOLVES TO
PHILADELPHIA‘S WATERFRONT

Wide view ACROSS THE DELAWARE RIVER settling on the
working side of the Philadelphia waterfront

We see LARGE FREIGHTERS laden with cargo while other

Traveling inland the camera comes to rest on an elevated
shot of a LARGE HISTORICAL GRAVEYARD that overlooks the
river

TOMBSTONES rise and fall in ever-undulating GRAVE sites
Seated on an old folding chair is ROCKY BALBOA Several
yards away staring in the opposite direction is PAULIE
His eyes are heavy with grief as he glances back at
ROCKY who appears to be speaking but not loud enough to
be audible

ROCKY

The ex-fighter stares at the headstone that reads

Obviously uncomfortable being there faces his brother-in-
law

PAULIE

ROCKY gestures he is not done a moment later he rises
kisses the headstone and with a sense of emotional
weariness folds his chair and crosses to PAULIE

ROCKY
-Time goes by too fast

PAULIE
--Not fast enough

They begin to move off among the growing evening shadows

PAULIE (CONT’D)
Where’s the kid He shoulda been here

ROCKY

- It’s all right

PAULIE
It ain’t all right

ROCKY
--He gets busy

PAULIE
He don’t get that ‘busy’

ROCKY
-»-Let’s not talk about it here Paulie

They walk a short distance - A distant ship horn is
heard

ROCKY (CONTD)

PAULIE
(defensively)
I’m workin’ - I took ‘the tour’ the last
three years

ROCKY
C’mon

PAULIE
I got responsibilities

ROCKY
Just a few hours

PAULIE
-Lemme think about it

The two men move away in strained silence as ROCKY takes
a fleeting glance at Adrian’s burial site

CLOSE UP - PLASMA SCREEN
The AUDIENCE REACTS WITH DISDAIN

COMMENTATOR 1 (V0)
There’s just no decent competition - Fans
are not going to pay good money to see
these one-sided affairs anymore — It’s a
virtual wasteland with Dixon who I
believe is a solid fighter surrounded by
an ocean of nobodies

Multiple shots of the audience heaving cups of ice into
the ring DIXON appears incensed yet troubled

COMMENTATOR 2
- There’s an old saying in boxing The
fortunes of the sport ride on the
shoulders of the heavyweight champion -
The way things are going this sport’s
facing slow and agonizing demise

MASON DIXON cannot mask his dejection

the complete contrast to his father Slightly smaller
than his father his body language does not convey a
sense of confidence

His clothing is business attire but simple like someone
who accepts just blending in His face is attractive not
stunning He is somewhat low in spirits but tries to
constantly mask it

ROBERT JR is confronted by a senior executive (30’s) who
appears to be verbally berating him ROBERT JRs gestures
Make it evident he is attempting to protest but is
bested by the executive who points an angry finger in
the young man’s face and exits ROCKY has taken all this
in

EXT -— STATE BOXING COMMISSIONS OFFICE BUILDING - SUNSET

The classical building is located in the center of the
city

INT STATE BOXING COMMISSIONER’S OFFICE DAY

FIVE MEN sit along the length of an elevated row table
like you would see at a senate hearing ROCKY sits below
them On the front of the dais is the Pennsylvania State
Boxing Commissions seal

COMMISSIONER 1 (V0)
The tests administered were much more
sophisticated than when you were
recommended to retire and so youve
passed the mandatory state exam But
frankly your age is still a big concern -
And weighing in all the different factors
and unpredictable elements that go along
with this sport we cannot in good
conscience recommend re-licensing at
this time

ROCKY
Didn’t I do what ya asked

COMMISSIONER 1
Yes but you understand it’s your best
interest we’re thinking of

ROCKY
But I did what ya asked right

COMMISSIONER 2
No one wants to be held accountable for a
serious injury or even a fatality

é ROCKY
I appreciate that but I passed them
tests

COMMISSIONER 3
If we’re wavering on this he should at
least redo all the testing

COMMISSIONER 4
How will that indemnify us

COMMISSIONER 1
I think we have to stand by our decision
It’s about moral accountability

ROCKY
Aint’ followin’ this

COMMISSIONER 2
Your request for a license at this time
is denied

ROCKY
(at a loss) aaa
Yodon’t I got some kind of rights

COMMISSIONER 2
Some “rights” may be open to
interpretation Which rights

ROCKY
‘Rights’ like in the thing they wrote
down the street

COMMISSIONER 2
The Bill of Rights

ROCKY
Yeah them rights

COMMISSIONER 2
What about them

ROCKY
They say somethin’ ‘bout pursuin’
happiness right

COMMISSIONER 1
Your point is

ROCKY
I’m pursuin’ somethin’ an’ nobody looks
too happy about it

COMMISSIONER 1
We’re only looking out for your
interests

ROCKY

(hotter)
Yeah I appreciate it but I did what ya
wanted me to do an’ more an’ that should
do it right I know ya doin’ ya job very
well an’ that’s good but why va gotta
kight’cause if somebody goes through all
the junk ya gotta go threugh to get where
they wanna get let ‘em Ain’t nobody
got the right to stop ‘em ‘cause maybe
someday some of you guys are gonna wake
up ‘an wanna finish somethin’ ya never
finished ‘an ya paid ya dues But ya
told ‘no forget it’ so ya never finished
it So whos got the right to tell ya
that after ya done what ya was asked to
do’ Nokody None of you guys know
what’s in the next guys heart only
that guy knowsYa gotta do what ya guts
tell ya to do if ya don’t ya just
takin’ up a seat until the next bums come
along Whos supposed to live like that
So if I ain’t gettin’ my license then
gimme more of them tests ‘Cause I ain’t
leavin’ here without somethin’ that
resembles what’s right

The commissioners pause to consider

will relate to this match up And as a
public relations kicker you’ll offer a
piece of the gate to some charity

ASSISTANT
- Children’s Charity -

PROMOTER

‘Children’s Charity’ You’ll tap your way
to a ten round decision and the hook is
people will see your compassion while
you put on a good show and don’t destroy

A fight - A title fight c’mon

Lc
No a Special Event - like an exhibition
fight

ROCKY
Thanks but I was thinkin less large -
Smaller

PROMOTER
Yknow nothin’ you do is going to be

around Technically you neyer lost the
belt in the ring You retired so ina
sense youre both Champions and youre
both at a point in your lives where you

want to do interesting things and this

would be very interesting

ROCKY
Gettin’ killed ain’t that interestin’

PROMOTER
Its an exhibition A glorified sparring
session With a portion of the gate
going to charity

ROCKY
So is this thing ain’t a joke

PROMOTER

no chance

A puncher always has a chance — when

you think you’ll hold up against Dixon

Well ya really don’t know a person’s
personality ‘til ya punch ‘em

REPORTER 2
Rocky the press has labeled you a
“Balboasaurus” who should be in a museum —
Your thoughts

ROCKY
I always liked museums

REPORTER 1
Mason let’s say the following happens -—
You win we’ll say you beat an old guy
you lose say a thumb in the eye you’ll
be the joke of the decade

MASON
That’s science fiction No chance of
that
(to Rocky)

You were someone once a good example for
the sport —- But I’ve never been cut
never been shook up never waivered -
Nobody really touched me on the face
hard so it ‘s going to be kinda hard to
convince anyone in America or the world
that a man like you could present any
problems -

ROCKY
Anything is possible -

The patrons cheer Robert Jr cringes

Again that’s science fiction type
thinking
