something he feels he simply must
say before you and I speak

LONGDALE
Yes I do have something to say I
insisted on being here as soon as I
heard Mrs Christian contacted you

WELLES
Im listening

LONGDALE
As Mr Christians attorney and one
of the executors of his estate it
concerns me that a meeting of this
sort should take place without my
being asked to attend

WELLES
Of what sort
LONGDALE
You are a private investigator

WELLES
Thats right

LONGDALE
Well whatever reasons Mrs
Christian has for engaging the
services of a private investigator
I should certainly be a party to
But since she feels differently I
can only go on the record as having
expressed my adamant disapproval

MRS CHRISTIAN
Yes how theatrical So youve gone
on the record and now perhaps you
should just be gone

Longdales irritated but has no choice He walks away

MRS CHRISTIAN
Have a pleasant evening
(to Welles)
Will you have tea Mister Welles

Thank you

MRS CHRISTIAN

Mostly Thats where he started his

(looks up at portrait)
He was a good man Notorious as an
eccentric but that was something he
cultivated He wanted to be
legendary

WELLES
He succeeded

MRS CHRISTIAN
We were married forty-five years
Hard even for me to imagine We had
our troubles There were plenty of
places for him to be other than
here but he was always loyal to me

Welles waits

Mrs
WALL

MRS CHRISTIAN
Do you carry a gun Mr Welles

WELLES
I wear a gun when I can tell a
client expects me to Other than
that theres never any reason

MRS CHRISTIAN
Just curious

Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE revealing a

SAFE The safe is ajar burnt and scarred

MRS CHRISTIAN
My husband was the only one with the
combination to this safe I knew
about it but as far as I was
concerned it was none of my
business Not till now that is

WELLES
You hired someone to open it Ill
bet the lawyer loved that

MRS CHRISTIAN
There was nothing he could do My
husband left everything to me
(looks at safe)
I prevented anyone from seeing the

broken into
contents I felt these were my
husbands private things I

didnt I didnt realize
WELLES

Do you want to tell me what you

found

MRS CHRISTIAN
Cash stock certificates and this

She takes something from her pocket puts it on the desk a
plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel

MRS CHRISTIAN
Its a film of a girl being
murdered

WELLES
Im afraid I dont

MRS CHRISTIAN
This is a movie showing a girl being
murdered Shes sitting on a bed

and a man rapes her and he begins
to cut her with a knife
(pause)

I only watched what I could
Welles picks up the film looks at it

MRS CHRISTIAN
I didnt know what to think I
cant tell you how horrible its
been to know this belonged to my
husband To know that he watched
this this atrocity But I cant
go to the police

WELLES

Mrs Christian please will you
sit down a moment

(leads her to a chair)
I want you to listen carefully
What youre talking about is a
snuff film But from what I
know snuff films are a kind of
urban myth Like red light
district folklore Theres no such
thing I can assure you

Mrs Christian shakes her head
WELLES
Please believe me This is
probably a stag film Simulated
rape Hard to stomach and it might
seem real but there are ways of
making it look realistic fake
blood and special effects

MRS CHRISTIAN

No

WELLES
If you were to study it youd see
the camera cutting away youd see

the tricks they can play

MRS CHRISTIAN
Im telling you its not that

WELLES
Im sure it is
(smiles)
Its probably something your husband
was given as a bad joke More than
likely he never even watched it

MRS CHRISTIAN
Will you watch it and see for
yourself

WELLES
Of course But Im certain its
nothing to worry about

INT CHRISTIAN HOUSE DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

The PROJECTOR CLATTERS shooting bright images

ON THE WALL FLASH FRAMES over exposure then the grainy
FILM is HAND HELD constantly in motion showing a skinny
GIRL 16 or 17 in a negligee sitting on a bed in a
nondescript room with little furniture Looks like a hotel
room We only ever see three walls The once beautiful
girl looks worn drugged dark circles under her eyes
staring blankly The CAMERAS tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
long shifting shadows as the camera moves but the girl
still stares oblivious The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
DUCT TAPE The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING
Welles watches crossing his arms already uncomfortable

ON THE WALL a door opens behind the girl looks like a
bathroom and a MASKED MAN enters

The Masked Man wears a garish Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
eye holes and a mouth The mask covers his entire head
Hes naked except for red shorts his body scrawny oiled
pale The man goes to stand in front of the girl He seems
to be saying something to her but the film is silent and
the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTORS LOUD sprocket hole
CLATTER Its all one long take The CAMERA MOVES to favor
the girl

Welles sits straight in his chair wary

ON THE WALL Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
girl knocking her back on the bed

Welles grimaces

ON THE WALL Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
position The girls like a rag doll face reddened eyes
closed but she remains upright Masked Man uses his thumbs
to open her unseeing eyes He touches her mouth with his
fingers presses his lips to hers Then Masked Man backs
away leaving frame till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
out Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades

Welles rises slowly still watching

ON THE WALL Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
back towards the girl

Welles crosses his arms tight disbelieving fearful

WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM but Welles
does In the flickering reflected light Welles backs
involuntarily away from the horrible images holding his
fist to his mouth breathing hard

Welles keeps backing away till hes backed against a wall
The PROJECTORS CLATTERING Welles is sickened sweating
still watching till he finally shuts his eyes

sorrow now shared

Welles sits

WELLES
You you need to go to the police

MRS CHRISTIAN

WELLES
You dont have any other choice

MRS CHRISTIAN

(stands shakes her head)
No For me to live with the ruin of
my husbands name I need know that
whoever did this will be punished
If you can find them I will take
their names to the police Ill say
my husband confessed on his death
bed Ill say I didnt have courage
to come forward at first

WELLES
It wont work like that

MRS CHRISTIAN
Any evidence you collect can be
given to the police later
anonymously Ive thought about it
and theres no other way If you
cant find them if the only thing
that comes from this film is that
this is all my husband will be
remembered for well I cant let
that happen Im telling you I
wont If theres no chance that
poor girls memory can be served
then Ill just have to spend my last
days trying to forget her

rests his head in his hands

WELLES

compensation will be appropriate to
the risk Youll need cash to buy

What can I do for you Mr Welles

WELLES
Call me Tom

DIRECTOR
Alright Tom

WELLES
What Id like very simply is
access to your archive And now I
understand this isnt something you
normally do for private citizens

DIRECTOR
There are reasons for the way we do
things here

WELLES
Absolutely Of course Ill abide by
whatever decision you make but Id
appreciate if youll hear me out

The director sits back in his chair

WELLES
Few days ago I was contacted by a
couple living in Philadelphia a
doctor and his wife What happened
was they picked up a young girl
hitchhiking off 81 which heads into
Philadelphia started up a
conversation with this girl she
looked homeless seemed about
eighteen maybe They convinced her
to let them buy her a meal in the
city Nice kid mature didnt have
much to say but they got a sense
shes a runaway so all through
dinner the doctors working on her
trying to convince her that at the
very least she should pick up a
telephone Not surprisingly she
ate her food excused herself
(snaps fingers)
Thats the last they saw her The
reason they came to me for help the
reason Im coming to you is we had
a friend of mine in the department
work up a sketch
(shows the POLICE ARTIST
SKETCH he photocopied)
They want to see if I can ID this
girl somehow pass along a message
to let the parents know the kids
alive doing alright

DIRECTOR
Why not go to the NC1IC or
NCMEC

WELLES
I figured you share information

DIRECTOR
We do

WELLES
For whatever reasons I thought you
might be more receptive

DIRECTOR
Why dont they come to me

WELLES
This doctor and wife theyre nice
people but they dont want to get
too involved Theyre not trying to
have the parents come looking for
the girl either
You and I both know sometimes not
often but sometimes theres real
reasons why a kidll run
Molestation whatever Besides
that the girls probably eighteen
so shes legal

DIRECTOR
Im not so sure about this

WELLES
Theyre putting themselves in place
of this kids parents and thinking
theyd want to hear their girls
okay even if thats all they hear

DIRECTOR

I can give you my card if your
clients want to call me

Welles accepts a CARD disappointed

WELLES

want this coming back on them

movie you can just drop off at the
one-hour photo

floating around

cheating and you dont blame her

coffee The homes decor is cheap and flowery

MRS MATHEWS
We werent religious We never
forced religion down her throat
like Ive seen some parents do to
their kids We never made her go to
church But after Mary was gone
thats when I got religious

Mrs Mathews brings two cups of coffee sits

MRS MATHEWS
Doesnt make much sense does it
When everythings happy when lifes
fine and you have every reason to
believe theres a God you dont
bother Then something horrible
happens thats when you start
praying all the time Thats when
you start going to church

WELLES
Were all like that

MRS MATHEWS
Are you religious
WELLES
No

MRS MATHEWS
You should be

Mrs Mathews drinks coffee stares into the cup

WELLES
Ive got what I need for my report
There is there is one thing that

bothers me though

MRS MATHEWS
What

WELLES
Its not really my place but its
not easy for me to set aside the
private detective part of me either
See I know a little about missing
persons When kids run they almost
always leave a note Its guilt
They want to say goodbye

MRS MATHEWS
There wasnt one The police looked

fq

WELLES
Do you think the police did a good
job

MRS MATHEWS
dont know I think so

WELLES
t is possible and I know this
isnt something you want to hear
Your daughter may have tried to hide
a note where she thought you would
eventually find it but where she
knew your husband would never find
it She might have wanted to tell
you something

MRS MATHEWS
No You dont have any reason to
think that

WELLES
If the police focused their search
in her room her belongings well
thatd be only natural but they may
have been looking in the wrong place

Mrs Mathews is getting upset

MRS MATHEWS
How how can you say that to me

WELLES
Will you let me look

MRS MATHEWS
My husband never laid a hand on her
She would have told me she would
have told me

WELLES
Youre probably right and I
probably wont find anything
I dont have a right to ask this
and you can kick me out of your
house if you want but this is my
profession and theres a part of me
that cant let it go Police are
just as human as you or I They
could have missed something They
probably didnt

(pause)
Wouldnt you rather know

Mrs Mathews thinks about it tortured shakes her head sadly

MRS MATHEWS
Go ahead and look if you want I
dont care what you do

Mrs Mathews gets up and walks out of the room

INT ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

Not many people in the place Welles drinks coffee Max

MAX
Youve got Penthouse Playboy
Hustler etc Nobody even considers
them pornography anymore Then
theres mainstream hardcore Triple
X The difference is penetration
Thats hardcore That whole
industrys up in the valley
Writers directors porn stars
Theyre celebrities or they think
they are They pump out 150 videos
a week A week Theyve even got
a porno Academy Awards America
loves pornography Anybody tells
you they never use pornography
theyre lying Somebodys buying
those videos Somebodys out there
spending 900 million dollars a year
on phone sex Know what else Its
only gonna get worse More and more
youll see perverse hardcore coming
into the mainstream because thats

evolution Desensitization Oh my
God Elvis Presleys wiggling his
hips how offensive Nowadays
Mtvs showing girls dancing around
in thong bikinis with their asses
hanging out Know what I mean For
the porn-addict big tits arent big
enough after a while They have to
be the biggest tits ever Some porn
chicks are putting in breast
implants bigger than your head
literally Soon Playboy is gonna be
Penthouse Penthouse1ll be Hustler
Hustlerll be hardcore and hardcore
films1ll be medical films

Peoplell be jerking off to women
laying around with open wounds
Theres nowhere else for it to go

WELLES
nteresting theory

MAX
What you saw tonight were not
talking about a video some dentist
takes home over the weekend Were
talking about stuff where people get
hurt Specialty product

WELLES
Child pornography

MAX
Theres two kinds of specialty
product legal and illegal Foot
fetish shit films watersports
bondage spanking fisting she-
males hemaphrodites its beyond
hardcore but legal This is the
kind of hardcore where one guys
going to look at it and throw up
another guy looks at it and falls in
love Now with some of the SM and
bondage films they straddle the
line How are you supposed to tell
if the person tied up with the ball
gag in their mouth is a consenting
or not Step over that line youre
into kiddie porn Rape films but
there arent many Ive never seen
one

WELLES
Snuff films

MAX
I heard you asking That guy wasnt
yanking you around Theres no such
thing

WELLES
What other ways are there to get
illegal films Who do you see

MAX
First of all basement sales like
tonight arent gonna last much
longer Its too risky one and
two everythings going on the
internet Anyone with a computer
and enough patience can find
anything he wants Its heaven for
those degenerate chicken-hawks
Theyre swapping pictures back and
forth as fast as their modems can
zap ‘em But theres still some
weird shit under the counter where
I work sometimes No one knows where
it comes from Thats local
underground where information
spreads by word of mouth Those are
zombies hardcore junkies Their
hands are permanently pruned They
go out in the sun they dont burn
they blister Other than that all
I know about is the mail
Classified ads in the paper with

hidden codes Secret couriers
Credit card orders to dummy
corporations Interstate wire

transfers Revolving PO boxes
But if youre asking me who do you
go to to get illegal shit who
knows Thats the whole point --
the seller stays as far away from
the buyer as possible and vice
versa and cops cant trace the
deal Theres ways to do it so
nobody knows who anybody is

Welles watches Max eat

WELLES
How old are you
MAX
Twenty-five

WELLES
Where are your parents

MAX
I dont know where are yours

WELLES
I dont mean any offense but what

hayseed What are you talking about

WELLES
You just strike me as smart enough
to be doing something else

MAX
Yeah Im a real genius What
choices have I got Fuck just
because I know about stuff like
tonight doesnt mean I deal it I
work a job It beats pumping gas
beats making hamburgers

WELLES
Youre telling me it doesnt get to
you

MAX
You cant sit there all day watching
the parade of losers that comes into
that place without going numb So
what
Am I gonna go off and be a race car
driver Go to Harvard Run for
President What about you pops

WELLES

seated on the mattress a huge man wearing a leather SM
harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film

Dino pulls back on the bow aiming away across the

warehouse He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
propped up He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET
Strikes the target dead center BULLS-EYE As Welles gets
closer he notices several things

a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD facing the bed along
with several movie LIGHTS

props Nice arent they
WELLES

Dino walks across towards the target

DINO VELVET
Machine and I were just talking
about knifes The beauty of
knifes

Dino pulls arrows from the target

DINO VELVET
He was saying how fascinated he is
by their simple ability to be sharp
The ability of a piece of metal to
be so thin that it is almost
nothing

Dino walks back to the table replaces the arrows in the
quiver cueing another arrow in is bow

DINO VELVET
So close to nothingness that it cuts
with minimum effort because its so
non-intrusive Flesh is fooled It
blooms open as the blade widens but
by then its too late because the
knifes already doing its pure
simple damage

Dino shoots another arrow to the target

A CLATTER attracts Welles attention Far across the
warehouse a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards A CAR with tinted
windows drives in

The MAN who opened the door silhouetted in sunlight stays
behind to close the door as the car pulls forward

DINO VELVET
Ah ours guests have arrived

Machine stands He is a giant
Welles takes a few steps back wary sweating hard now

The car parks across the warehouse not far from the target

Dino puts another arrow in his bow pulls it taunt aims at
the target turns aims the arrow at Welles
