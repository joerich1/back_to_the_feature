TO THE WHITE SEA

Screenplay by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

Based on the novel by James Dickey

August 13 1998
FADE IN
Cobalt blue

A dark speck is just visible in the center of the screen It resolves itself into a sea bird flying
toward us

As it passes we hear the propeller engines of a B-29 and a title burns in

TINIAN ISLAND
March 8 1945

From just below us the aircraft looms into frame and roars off into the distance leaving only the
sound of the wind

Voice
Fire We are going to bring it to him
CLOSE

On the weathered face of the Colonel Extremely close He is the speaker We are pulling back
slowly at the cut

Fire This is what you’ve got to look forward to This is what Hes got to

look forward to We’re going to bring it to him To the enemy you know Up

yonder friends Up yonder to the north
He points his finger up -

North and fire
FLOATING
High high up in an empty airplane hangar Down below us laid out like a grid on a bombing
plan are rows of folding chairs In the chairs are khaki-clad airmen Standing at the front is the
Colonel just lowering his hand

We are going to put him in it That’s saying friends that we’re going to put it

all around him A around him Were going to put it over him and underneath
him We’re going to put it down on him and on fo him

DISSOLVE TO 7
OVERHEAD TRACK

Closer looking straight down on the seated rows of airmen passing beneath

We’re going to put it in his eyes and up his asshole in his wife’s twat and in
his baby’s diaper We’re going to put it in his pockets where he can’t get rid of it
White phosphorous that will hold on

DISSOLVE TO
FORWARD TRACK

From the back of the hangar tracking forward just skimming the heads of the airmen as we
approach the distant Colonel

We’re going to put it in his dreams Whatever heaven he’s hoping for we’re
fixing to make a hell out of it Soon good buddies We just got the good word
this morning White phosphorous and napalm That’s our good stuff for the little
yellow man and his folks We’re going to make him a present of it in his main
city Bestow it Give it away With three hundred airplanes With both hands
They’re going to remember us Within a week I clue you That’s all I can tell
you now But were going all the way with incendianes

We have arrived at the Colonel and come to rest on the extreme close up with which we began

No ammo no gunners All bombs All payload All fire

WIDE REVERSE
On the rows and rows of assembled airmen staring mutely at the Colonel He continues

Colonel
The firebomb strike is going to be gravy But that’s not tonight Tonight it’s the
same as always gunners and all One moretime with frags and two-thousand
pound GP’s We rendezvous at angels nine at sixteen three seven Your course
is three-five-six degrees true The target is Tokyo

The airmen rise and we go to slow motion slowly tracking forward through the milling pilots
navigators and gunners to find one young man still seated perfectly still staring off towards the
front of the hangar The cacophany of voices fades away to leave once again the sound of the
wind And we hear a different younger voice
Voice

When I tell you this just say it came from a voice in the wind a voice without a

voice which doesn’t make-a sound You can pick it up anytime it snows or

even just when the wind is from the north

The boy looks slowly down at his watch and we cut to

WHITE

A swath of the white is wiped away We are looking through the soaped-up plexi bubble on the
tail section of a B-29

INT TAIL SECTION

The boy Muldrow soaps down the gunner’s bubble at the back of the empty bomber

On an ammo belt being slowly lowered into a feed box gently curling over on top of itself
CLOSE

On toggle switches being clicked on

CLOSE Fe

On an ordinary bread knife its double edge honed to razor sharpness Muldrow reaches up and
bends it almost double

With the harsh sound of nipping tape we cut to

CLOSE

On the boys skin as he tapes the bread knife carefully to his side underneath his flight suit
CLOSE

On a parachute being taped down to the side of the airplane near the bulkhead

CLOSE

The blue sky reflected in the curved plexi of the tail-gunners bubble A dark distorted speck
moves across the blue

On Muldrow’s eyes squinting up through the bubble at the sky
CLOSE

On a bird moving across the sky

BOOMING DOWN

On Muldrow lying on his bunk fully clothed in his flight gear
As we boom down into an extreme close up he closes his eyes
FADE OUT

OVER BLACK

Voice
You the big Nip knocker around here

Muldrow opens his eyes to see two new recruits standing over his bed One is a pale redhead
The other one the speaker is taller and rougher looking with a snake tattooed on his left
shoulder

Muldrow
I’m Muldrow

Man
Four kills right

Muldrow
Seven

Man
The board says four

Muldrow
Go read the board then

Man
Pll do it or not do it little man

Muldrow looking bored sits up on the edge of his bunk

Muldrow
Take off buddie I’ve still got to count up and check off
Man
You say youre gonna jack off
Redhead
Don’t fool with him Arlen
Arien
This little prick He don’t have his twin fifties now I could bust his back with
one chop
Muldrow
Tell me something snake You like money
Arlen
What
Muldrow

Do you like money
The taller man looks at his pal then back to Muldrow

Arlen
Yeah I like money

Muldrow
You got any

Arlen
Some

Muldrow
Twenty

Arlen

Yeah I got twenty

Muldrow
Yl bet you fifty against twenty that I’m stronger than you are

Arlen
How’re you gonna tell

Muldrow
It’s just something we take on you and me We both try to do it but you can’t do
itand I can That’s all

Arlen
T could bust your ass in half you little shit
Muldrow
Yeah but let’s try this first oe
Arlen
Name it
Muldrow

See that brace over your head that long two-by-four Grab it and chin on it

Arlen
That all

The big man jumps up chins gracefully on the two-by-four and drops back down
How’s that asshole

Muldrow
Average Now jump up and catch it from underneath like this

Muldrow holds up four fingers together with the thumb opposite-a pinch grip-to show him
The big man knits his brow unsure where this isgoing
Goon Try it

Arlen jumps up catches the brace but can’t hold and falls back down to the floor
No grip No grip no guts That’s what they say

Muldrow hops off the bunk
Stand clear

He jumps

He catches the brace with one hand in the pinch grip and swings from it He adjusts getting
both hands on the board

Muldrow
Now watch

He has stopped swinging He chins quickly up lowers himself slowly and then chins slowly
and gracefully two more times

Muldrow drops to the floor and turns to face the big man extending his hand

Muldrow
Shake
The bigman hesitates
C’mon Shake
Arlen

I don’t think so With that grip you got there might not be too much left

Muldrow
A few bone splinters maybe I could use those You can sew with them

Arlen furrows his brow and shifts uneasily

Arlen
L uh Tl ain’t got your twenty

Muldrow
Uh-huh

Muldrow turns back to the bunk and the big man shuffles away leaving the redhead Staring at
Muldrow’s back

Red
1 D’ve been assigned to your crew Muldrow I never have to ask anybody
but once ¢ who the best gunner in the squadron is They all say you don’t fly with
them—they fly with you It’s a damned honor I’m fucked if it’s not
On the bunk Muldrow is sorting through things from an emergency kit He ignores the redhead

Can I ask you one thing sergeant Just one

Muldrow
I guess What is it
Red
This is my first time out Have you got anything special you can clue me in

on
Muldrow turns finally to face the kid holding two small stones in his hand

Muldrow
Nothing special Don’t waste your ammo Never fire at anything out of panic
Make it count That’s all

so Red
That’s all

Muldrow
Youll be all right Just get up there and do what you know Get them Nip
fighters on the pursuit curve and let them slide on down the string just like they-
showed you in gunnery school Even if you can see them don’t shoot first ‘cause
then they can see you Keep the Nips off you with that fifty caliber and the Major
will get you on back here That’s a fact

Red
What’re those in your hand Some kind of lucky stones

Muldrow
They might be lucky down the road They’re flints To make fire

Red a
Don’t you got matches in your emergency kit

Muldrow
Sure but when they’re gone they’re gone With the flints you got all the fire you
want ae
Red
Can I try ‘em
Muldrow smiles
Muldrow

Sure Try all you want
Muldrow hands him the stones and Red knocks them together Nothing happens

Red
How do you do it Is there a trick to it

Muldrow takes the stones and walks back to the bunk the kid following
Muldrow
The trick is to practice for a few years Everybody in this barracks could knock
these rocks together all night and they wouldn’t get a single spark If you needed
fire youd all freeze to death

Red
Show me how you do it

We are close on the rocks being held over the bunk Muldrow strikes one against the other A
spark flares

Close on Muldrows lips they pucker with an exhalation onto the stone
Close on the blanket as the spark lands

Muldrow (off)
See There’s plenty of fire in the rocks All you want

Another breath coaxes the spark to bloom into a tiny flame in the nap of the blanket

Red (off)

Colonel says we’re gonna burn the Japsnp Gonna burn ‘em up in a couple of
days “

We move even closer on the flame until it fills the screen

Muldrow (off)
Yeah but not tonight Tonight we’ve got a chance to knock on ‘em

NIGHT 20000 FEET

A squadron of B-29s in tight formation drones among the broken clouds in the moonlight

WAIST SECTION B29

The engine noise is relentless as the new starboard gunner the redhead sweaty and scared
wearing an O02 mask peers out into the night nervously clutching his guns

TAIL BUBBLE

Muldrow crouches calmly behind his guns in the plexiglass bubble surrounded by night sky
His gaze out at the sky is focused and alert

His point-of-view shows spooky mountains of cumulus clouds backlit by bright moonlight No
sign of enemy aircraft

THE COCKPIT

The pilot and navigator are dimly lit by the lights from the instrument panel

WAIST SECTION

Across from Red the port gunner is dozing his mask pushed up on his forehead The
bombardier dozes next to him

Red glances nervously over at his sleeping companions clearly uncomfortable being the only
one awake in the waist

li
BACK TO MULDROW

Still staring impassively out at the clouds
There is a momentary glint moonlight against metal in the distance
Muldrow does not visibly react except

His hands tighten on the guns

THE PILOT
Looking down at his radar He reaches over his head and throws a switch

PILOT
We got something closing above and behind us

MULDROW
Softly
Muldrow
I see it
WAIST SECTION

The port gunner stirs and pushes his mask down while across from him on the starboard gun
Red is sweating and breathing hard

RED -
If he sees him why don’t he shoot Christ I can’t see him
TAIL BUBBLE
Muldrow stares out through the bubble at the night sky

It is dark and empty

Then suddenly flashes as the enemy pilot fires

Bullets rip into the tail section of the plane

The plain rocks Muldrow coolly pans the twin fifties as he hunches forward to peer through the
gun sights ne

WAIST SECTION

We hear the AKAKAKAKAKAK of the enemy guns

RED
JESUS WHAT’S THE MATTER WHY DON’T HE SHOOT

The bombardier looks impassively over at Red
Bombardier
Take it easy pal We’re just getting started
BACK TO MULDROW

Peering through the gunsights as more bullets rip into the tail section a couple puncturing the
plexi bubble He still slowly pans the guns

His point-of-view through the gunsights shows muzzle flashes—ending the sky going black

The enemy plane is now invisible

Muldrow continues to sightseemingly on nothing—as he pans the guns moving in the same
direction and at the same pace as when he was tracking the flashes

His finger tenses on the trigger

Through the sights we see blackness No target
Muldrow pans staring down the sights

His headset crackles

Pilot
Muldrow

a

Nothing in the sights but black no sound but the thrumming of the aircraft

Muldrow’s finger squeezes

The twin fifties chatter spewing fire

Through the sights we see tracers being swallowed to no effect by impenetrable blackness
The guns continue to roar

Muldrow’s arms shake with the guns bucking and smoking in his hands

The tracers still probe only blackness and then-

BOOM--an extravaganza of dazzling light a huge explosion very close

WAIST SECTION
Light illuminates the compartment as the shock wave hits throwing crew members to the floor

The redhead terrified holds on for dear life

BACK TO MULDROW
Hunched over his guns He speaks softly into his headset

so Muldrow
Did you see that Major You think I mighta hit that fucker

His headset crackles
Pilot
I saw it Muldrow we all saw it Now get off the hom
THE COCKPIT
As the pilot regains control of the aircraft

Pilot
Bombardier the plane is yours

WAIST SECTION
The bombardier acknowledges

‘Bombardier
Aye aye sir

Just then the plane is rocked with a barrage of small explosions and the redhead wide-eyed
yells

RED
THE FUCK IS THAT

The bombardier looks calmly down into the Nordrom bomb sight

It shows anti-aircraft fire coming from the ground speeding toward them

AERIAL VIEW APPROACHING TOKYO

We enter a bank of clouds and emerge to see a surrealistic scene of a city sky dotted with huge
tethered balloons Giant searchlights pan the skies and anti-aircraft fire streaks through the air to
explode at various altitudes

TAIL SECTION

Muldrow holds on tight Through the bubble we can see the sweep of the searchlights and
exploding anti-aircraft shells

The plane bucks and rocks from the aftershocks

EXTERIOR

Twelve droning B-29s revealed by the anti-aircaft fire and the ground searchlights open their
bomb-bay doors

WAIST SECTION

The bombardier peers intently into his sights waiting for the exact moment

The docks of Tokyo become visible immediately ahead
The bombardier’s right hand tenses on a lever

Bombardier
Five four7 °° 7”

The docks scattered with huge cranes and gantries start to pivot beneath us
three two one
The bombardier squeezes the lever

Through the sights bombs drop dead away

EXT LOOKING UP AT THE BOMBERS

Two-thousand pound bombs fall towards us through the searchlight-swept clouds

TAIL SECTION
Muldrow leans forward staring down through the bubble

There is a series of fiery explosions below like a row of flowers blooming

WAISTSECTION
The bombardier also watches through his sights

Bombardier
Eight birds eight bull’s eyes Let’s get the hell outta—

The inside of the cabin goes blinding white and a split second later an enormous BOOM

THE BUBBLE
Muldrow is hurled over his gun butts

A tremendous wind coming from midships howls through the cabin

Muldrow pushes himself off the gun butts against the wind

The plane starts to list nose-down and he is thrown back against his seat He looks down at his
feet

His view through the bubble shows the plane barrel-rolling the background sweeps from earth
to cloud bank to starry sky

Muldrow whispers

Muldrow
Man Iam here

The starry sky twinkles
The wind howls around Muldrow He reaches up to his belt
Close on its buckle as he releases it

Muldrow is sucked from his seat and bangs up against the wall Everything not nailed down is
flying around the cabin

Muldrow grabs ahold of the cargo webbing and swings himself around

Half crawling half tumbling weightlessly he claws his way down to the waist fetching up
against the walls like a clapper in a bell

THE WAIST
Muldrow tumbles in and reaches for a bracket by the hatch
His hands close over the bracket hanging on

An airborne parachute pack bangs him in the head and swings him around One hand flails
loose he manages to hang on with the other

The redhead tumbles by in mid-air screaming
Muldrow looks to his right toward the hatch

His parachute is right there where he left it straining in the gale force wind against the tape that
holds it to the wall He reaches with his free hand and rips it from the wall

Muldrow twists around wrestling the parachute -ento his back

In front and below him he can see into the cockpit Half of it is blown away The fires of Tokyo
burn far below

The wind blowing through the airplane is starting to sound like a scream

He swings with one hand to grab a jump bar over the hatch then calmly pulls the pin from the
latch

He heaves his shoulder into the hatch but it doesn’t budge

Just as he manages to get his other hand on the bar the plane lists again swinging him violently
away from the hatch then just as violently the plane swings him back

He hits the hatch squarely with both feet and it-and he-are gone

Everything in the cabin is sucked toward the door

EXTERIOR
Muldrow hits the night air in a vortex of debris
Above him against the stars the flailing body of another airman without a chute rumbles
We look straight down as Muldrow tumbles away end over end receding to a speck
The scream of the airplane fades away and we hear his voice
Muldrow (voice-over)
Cold weather is right for me Wherever its cold enough I can get along Dark

weather is right

We are close on Muldrow as he spreads his arms and legs arresting his tumble He floats like a
hawk on a thermal

Nearly everything about the cold is good The cold weather birds are the
fiercest and the prettiest by far There’s not a bird in the jungle that can compare
with them

The fires of Tokyo are rushing up toward him

The wind whips his face He reaches up and pulls the rip cord

The lines from the chute shoot up toward the stars and the canopy blossoms filling the screen
with an unnatural white

The white dissapates and we move through it as through a bank of clouds to reveal that we are
airborne high above a snow-covered mountain range

We top the farthest ridge and an endless expanse of snow opens up beyond us stretching to the
horizon as far as we can see

Distantly something breaks the uniform blankness of the snow a winding line of trees defines a
river course the river itself now invisible frozen over and covered with snow

A small trainlike shape is moving slowly along the contour of the line of trees Its motion
irregular in its parts but smooth as a whole resolves itself as we draw closer into that of a dog
sled

It slows and stops

CLOSER

The young man driving the team--a boy really—is Muldrow He steps off the sled and goes to a-
dark patch in the snow nearby

The dark patch is the frozen carcass of a beaver It stares sightlessly up light snow dusting its
whiskers frozen spittle trailing from its mouth body stiff

A recent snowfall has covered its hind feet and softened the small mounds of snow there formed
by some earlier agitation

Muldrow whisks the snow away with his mittens revealing the trap which holds the animal by
one shredded foot

He squeezes the trap open and carefully resets the crosspiece that keeps its steel teeth separated
He carries the carcass back to the sled

He steps onto the back of the sled and with a click of the tongue mushes the dogs Their breath
puffs in the late afternoon air as the sled creaks back into motion

There is a snapping sound The double line of dogs abruptly slues leftward and the sled
crunches to a hait

The dogs on the right have come loose from the sled itself and are now connected by harness
only to their partners on the left The severed trace mearis the team no longer pulls

Muldrow steps from behind the sled to examine the hamess

The rawhide strap that connected the right rearmost dog to the sled has a frayed end hanging
free

The dogs unsure of why they are halted and restive look back at Muldrow

He steps back to the sled He takes off his mittens to undo the lacing that holds a canvas cover
on the sled He rests the mittens on the front of the sled

The lacing is tight Muldrow pauses in undoing the knot to clap his hands together The dogs
start at the sharp noise then resettle

Muldrow blows on his hands hurriedly finishes undoing the knot
He pulls back a comer of the canvas and pulls out a length of line

He goes to the snapped rawhide blowing on his hands He hurriedly and expertly ties one end of
the line to one end of the snapped trace

He takes a knife from a sheath at his waist and cuts off about a foot of line

After resheathing the knife he pauses to slap his hands down against his thighs He waves his
hands vigorously rubs them briskly together He looks at the horizon

Fhe sun hangs just above the horizon

He picks up the length of line and is about to start tying it a little more fumbling now to the
other loose end of the severed trace Before the knot is finished the line is whipped out of his
hands
There is snarling and yapping Two dogs in the middle of the team have started fighting Their
motion has jerked the line from Muldrows hands and given the sled an unbalanced lurch
forward

A third dog constrained by the harness starts snarling and awkwardly twists to join in the fight
Muldrow grabs a whip from its mount on the back of the sled

He wades into the yapping dogs and uses the knout to slap them apart and restore order

A couple of lingering snarls a couple more blows from the knout

The team is now quiet

Muldrow blows on his hands rubs them together He glances across the snow
The bottommost sliver of the sun is just disappearing below the horizon

He replaces the whip and goes to the front of the sled blowing on his fists to pick up his
mittens

The mittens are gone

He looks at the chumed snow in front of the sled but the mittens are not there In lurching
forward the sled probably covered them

Muldrow shakes his head angry He-slaps his hands against his thighs He goes to the back of
the sled

With clicks and shouts he mushes the team With the unbalanced team pulling and Muldrow
awkwardly wrestling the sled from behind he finally manages to clear the sled from the area it
had formerly covered

There is chumed snow no foreign objects break the field of white

He blows on his hands then stabs them into the snow here and there feeling

He comes up empty A loud Oh as he slaps his stinging hands together He glances at the
horizon

The horizon now bisects the setting sun It will soon have disappeared entirely

Muldrow looks at the team of dogs

Dogs here and there still restive and curious at this lengthening halt look back ears pricked
Muldrow trots to where he was working on the line He stoops and with difficulty picks up the
two separate ends His fingers are barely working sufficiently to pick up each end of line he
clamps them awkwardly between middle of thumb and ball of opposing finger

His fingertips will not cooperate in forming a knot

He vigorously thumps his hands tries again

He cannot form a knot
The dogs look back

Muldrow straightens With the approaching dark the wind has picked up blowing the top layer
of powder in eddys around his feet

He surveys the line of trees

Moving with a sense of urgency now he trots to a nearby declivity between a couple of trees
Dead drift washed up by the river now frozen pokes through the snow in a couple of places

He hurriedly stamps down some nearby snow to make a packed bed

He pulls up a few of the larger pieces of drift awkwardly having to use both hands and hustles
them over to deposit them on the packed snow

He pulls up some of the smaller branches which bear leaves now dead He clumsily closes a fist
around one of the branches and drags the branch through stripping the crackling leaves onto his
little wooden hearthpad

He likewise strips another branch

He pulls his flints from his pocket with a trembling hand and with the branches standing by as
kindling he squats over the dead leaves

With the flints held not lightly in his fingertips but clamped heavily in his pawlike fists he tries
to strike them He sometimes misses altogether and strikes only knuckles when the flints do hit
they yield no spark

The dogs back at the riverbed look curiously over ears pricked Here one shakes itself there
another goes down on its forepaws to bite snow from between the pads on its feet

Muldrow trots to the rearmost dog on the right He bends to unharness it
His fingers are useless on the traces The dog sniffs curiously back at him

Muldrow takes out his knife and cuts the harness freeing the dog As the dog starts to edge
warily away Muldrow jams a hand awkwardly into the strap at its shoulder

The other dogs are watching

The free dog resists at first With clicks and a couple of slaps however it falls in as Muldrow

stooped hand through its shoulder strap trots it away from the team

The dog obstinately halts digging in Muldrow strikes it again and the dog again trots with him
They round a treed hillock The dog team is now hidden

Muldrow halts swings one leg over the dogs back he is straddling it

The dog squirms between his legs Muldrow is lowering his weight onto the dog immoblizing it
from above as he once again takes out his knife

He hooks one elbow under the dogs snout hugging its head with his face pulling its snout up
His other hand has disappeared

With a sudden downward motion the dog wrenches its head down and away twisting to break
free Muldrow’s frozen hand closes over the harness on the dogs back as the momentum throws
him to the ground

The dog is twisting violently around trying to close its jaws on Muldrow’s arm

He pulls the snarling dog toward him and plunges the knife into the dogs throat

There is a gurgling sound as blood steams into the snow The dog continues to writhe

From behind the hillock the team starts baying

The writhing subsides and the dog lies still Muldrow rolls it onto its side

Its eyesare still open Once or twice it blinks

Muldrow pushes the knife in at its belly He drags the knife headwards opening a slit in the
belly

The dogs eyes lower to half-open and are still The hidden team continues to bay

Warm vapor rises from the ragged gashes at the dogs throat and belly Muldrow drops his knife
and plunges his frozen hands into the dog’s belly

NIGHT

Muidrow sits at the fire now crackling by the river

DAWN
CLOSE ON HARNESS

Mended

MULDROW

He stands in the churned-up snow behind the sled Beyond him his fire still crackles He is
sinking a rod here and there into the snow

MINUTES LATER

Muldrow stands at the top of the hillock that is between the sled and where he killed the dog
He is pulling on his mittens looking

A wolf from a pack of three looks up from the carcass of the dog The other two continue to
root in the carcass

The sled dogs head waggles with the activity of the feeding beasts

LATER

Still day Muldrow pulls the sled up before an isolated cabin It is in a clearing the far end of
which ends in a vertical drop Beyond it is sea

Smoke rises from the cabins chimney

TNTERIOR CA

As Muldrow enters a man in his forties who sits before the fireplace does not react He is
mending something with needle and thread

Muldrow pulls off his gloves His hands are still red and swollen

He wordlessly pulls a chair around to face the fire
He sits to warm his hands

His father glances over sees the boys hands
He goes back to his sewing

Muldrow gazes into the fire

Its flames lap at the wood

Muldrow stares

DISTANT FIRES

Fires in the night rush up toward us from the buming docks Our perspective wrenches and
twists

Muldrow grunts as his descent is brought up short

He twists in the harness of his parachute

He looks down

Twisting below—far below—is the black sparkle of water

It is bordered by gray pavement dock The line between solid dock and tossing water rotates
slowly with our twisting perspective

Muldrow looks up

The view up is equally dizzying The lines from his chute are surrounding radial lines that twist
They reach up to meet the dull white of the underside of his chute

The parachute has snagged on a projecting piece of trusswork far above
Muldrow looks around

He is suspended from the gantry of a crane at the docks of Tokyo harbor
Very present is the creak of his twisting gear

Less present is the lap of water below

Distant is the intermitting booming of bombardment and anti-aircraft fire
Muldrow reaches up
He grabs his line and starts climbing hand over hand

The line is too thin to climb comfortably It is too fine for him to be able to use his feet he
cannot pinch it between sole and ankle to help support his weight All of his weight is bome by
his arms and the cord digs into the meat of his hands

He pauses looks up

A very long way to go It will not happen

He looks over

The strutwork of the crane many feet away

He lowers himself hand over hand and lets himself drop the last foot or so to hang once again
suspended from the harness

He withdraws his knife He reaches up and cuts the lines from one shoulder His shoulder jerks
down a bit as each line is severed Cutting the last line on the one side causes him to swing the
opposite way

He reaches out with an ankle trying to hook a crossbar on the crane

He just misses swings his legs to try to increase the arc of his pendulum swing

The next swing into the crane allows him to hook an ankle He swings the arm of his untethered
shoulder grabs the crane pulls himself in

He cuts his other shoulder free

He starts climbing the crane

TOP OF THE CRANE
Muldrow reaches the projecting gantry and starts across it to gather his chute

Midway there he stops reacting to human noise from below He looks down

The view down along the abstract receding geometry of the crane is disorienting Far below we
see the tops of two helmeted headsJapanese soldiers They are shouting as they look down
over the dock into the water

Two more soldiers—helmet tops from our perspective-are running to join them

The soldiers back away from the lip of the dock to make way for somebody climbing up

An American airman ditched into the bay is exhaustedly hauling himself up and collapsing onto
the dock

The soldiers jabber at him Kicks rouse him to his feet

One soldier hooks an arm under the airmans shoulder and starts to lead him away One of the
other soldiers however accompanying raises his own arm high holding something indistinct
He strikes downward onto the airmans head

A second after we see the blow we hear the dull impact

The airman is still being held up by the shoulder though his body sags

Another blow

A second later we hear it

The soldier who had been supporting the airman now releases him and he flops onto his back
He is looking straight up at us

Muldrow looks
The man looks back perhaps seeing him perhaps not
The soldiers are kicking at him The man with the truncheon continues to strike him

Closer on the kicked man shows his eyes looking directly up fluttering closed and then open
again He stares up looking blinks a couple of times

His eyes seem to glaze-still staring he seems no longer to see
Muldrow watches

The sounds of the blows are delayed rather faint The men continue to shout as they kick and
hit

At length long after the airman has ceased to move the blows stop
The men stand back

One of them steps up gestures for another to join him He grabs a heel the other man grabs a
heel ne

The party leaves dragging the dead man with them leaving a smear of blood
Their voices fade to silence

Muldrow advances toward his chute

CRANE CAB
Minutes later

Muldrow is climbing down towards the cab his bundled chute hugged under one arm

INTERIOR CAB

Its bottom trap door is thrown open and Muldrow enters He closes the trap door behind him
He looks around

The front window of the crane looks out at the projecting gantry Though the interior of the cab
is still dark the gantry pointing out to sea seems to be aiming at a faint red glow to the east--the

beginning of dawn

Muldrow jams his parachute behind the crane operators chair He sits down on the floor and
empties his pockets spreading the objects on the floor in front of him to take an inventory

He has ee
His knife

A 45 pistol

Two clips for the pistol

A small packet of fish hooks

A length of twine
A tin of C-rations with a top-opening key
Two flints
A compass The north on the compass is labeled with an ornately seriffed N
Something that looks like a silk handkerchief which he spreads to examine
On one side is a map of Japan Tokyo labeled on the main island

His gaze shifts to one side

A small diamond inside a circle has comers that point the four directions only the top however
N has been labeled

His gaze drifts up the map northward
along the length of the main island to the north island where it lingers
Moving again it travels up the northern archipelago of Japanese islands

A dotted line across the map indicates a break in scale above it is another archipelago which the
continuing upward pan reveals to be the Aleutians

Muldrow gazes
At length he flips the handkerchief over
There is print on the other side

The top line is in English Each line underneath is in a different transliterated foreign language
specified to the left

Muldrow looks at the English original at the top

Muldrow looks expressionlessly up

The window of the gantry glows red

BLACK

We linger in black Quiet

We begin to hear a very faint clung-clung-clung-a rhythmic very distant hollow metallic
sound

MULDROW

His eyes open

Still in the cab he has been asleep From the light we know that it is now full day
He holds very still listening

The clung-clung-clung while still faint seems to be growing

Muldrow cautiously rises to a half-crouch freezes again listening

The metallic sound continues and continues to grow

Muldrow hurriedly gathers his things He presses himself into a back comer of the cab behind
the operators seat Crouched largely hidden by the seat he holds his knife at the ready

The climbing footsteps continue

Muldrow is still

Closer and closer yet still not very loud

The interior of the cab makes the footfalls resonate like the inside of a drum

Muldrow is motionless and ready but not tensed

There is no movement only sound
The footsteps continue slow regular approaching
They are quite close
Their rhythm breaks

There is a pause some scuffing some metallic scraping

With a startlingly loud screech the trap door swings up The man entering is largely hidden from
Muldrow by the operators seat

He climbs in straightens--we fleetingly see the straw hat he wears--and starts to ease the trap
door closed but then drops it the last bit to let it slam

We see only his legs as he pauses shuffles a bit turns and seats himself

He puts a lacqueur bento box on the floor next to his chair shifts in the chair clears his throat
We have yet to see his face

We hear paper rustling Another throat clear

He is reading the newspaper

He turns a page

There is a long silence
With an absent shift of weight the sole of his right foot twists on the floor

The foot has been resting on the silk of a tufted-out piece of the stowed parachute Its slick twist
underfoot is apparently sensable

The foot twists again experimentally and there is another creak and shift of weight as the man
leans to look down at the floor

After a moment fingers reach down to feel A murmur
Another still beat

But now a drop of blood hits the white silk And another drop Blood patters down onto the
silk

We are close on the man’s eyes they do not move
We pan down to his slashed throat

Muldrow holds the mans head by his hair holding the head forward forcing the flow of blood
outward onto the floor

It patters now onto the cab floor like rain on a tin roof

Muldrow reaches down snatches up part of the chute and quickly winds the silk around the
man’s throat He seems to be taking some care with the blood

MINUTES LATER

Muidrow is now wearing the mans clothes He is sitting on the floor of the cab grunting both
hands forward trying to pull on one of the mans shoes

It is too small
Muldrow gives up looks at the man

The man is laid out on the floor naked except for a length of white silk stained red wrapped
round his throat

Muldrow puts on his own boots pulls the pant cuffs down trying to hide as much as possible
He looks evaluating and is not really satisfied

He pulls over the mans bento box After a quick examination he sees how to slide it open He
frowns

Inside neatly laid out in different compartments are various unidentifiable foods

Muldrow examines each Some of it is clearly raw fish Some is fried food of mysterious
provenance -

Muldrow picks up a piece of fish sniffs it eats it He picks up another piece It is covered with
orange roe

He examines it He licks off a few bubbles of the roe feels them with his tongue He pops some
of it between his front teeth

The silence is interrupted by a loud rattling ring

It is a long wheezing ring like a telephone excent that it has a more gradual attack and trail-off
as if rung by hand-crank ee

There is a primitive telephone handset cradled by a black box next to the seat Apparently it is
the means by which the ground communicates with the crane operator

A long silence Muldrow sets down the bento box

Another wheezing ring

Another silence Muldrow is stuffing his gear into the pockets of the pyjama coat he now wears
As he is finishing there is a very faint shout He looks out the window

Far below small and foreshortened a man shouts up

Muldrow hesitates opens the window sticks an arm out the window gives an acknowledging
wave He waits a moment then peeks again

The small foreshortened man is walking away shaking his head

Along the dock the other cranes are roaring to life grinding into motion The work day is
starting

Muldrow moves the dead mans legs so that he can haul open the trap door

EXTERIOR CRANE

Muldrow is climbing down His straw hat is pulled down as low over his eyes as it will go
He reaches the dock and starts walking

A motorized cart is approaching Two men ride in front

Muldrow keeps to his steady pace and keeps his chin low

The cart passes with a shout from one of the men The other man laughs

The activity on the dock behind him is quickening as Muldrow reaches the end of the dock

The area here is a maze of warehouses Facing Muldrow is a large sign

On the right side of the sign is some information ia Japanese and an arrow pointing to the right
On the left side of the sign is some information in Japanese and an arrow pointing to the left

Across the bottom of the sign is information of greater importance apparently because the
characters are bigger and in red

Muldrow gazes at the sign

Behind him from the dock ring the voices of men at work From nearby however is a subtle
intermittent clink-clink-clink

Muldrow looks to the nght

There is a narrow concrete staircase leading down with a chain strung across its entrance The
staircase is just where dock meets shore presumably it leads down to the beach The heavy
machinery operating on the dock communicates vibrations to which the chain responds swaying
and clinking ever so slightly

Muldrow goes to the chain gives a quick look around swings one leg over swings the other
over starts to descend

STAIRWAY

On one side the stairway is open to the harbor on the other side is stone seawall

Midway down some of the steps are wet We hear the trickle of water Muldrow looks up the
stone wall

A couple of feet above eye level is the mouth of a drainage pipe

Muldrow tenses jumps catches the lip of the drainage pipe with his hands and easily chins
himself up and in

DRAINAGE PIPE

It is perhaps four feet in diameter It slopes slightly upward Water trickles only down its
middle

In a crouch Muldrow proceeds up the pipe his footsteps becoming progressively more resonant
About twenty feet up there is a bend Muldrow looks back toward the mouth

The mouth of the pipe is a small bright circle fitied by the blue of the harbor Light streaks in to
highlight the corrugated ripples of the pipe

Muldrow turns the bend In front of him now is only black

He sits crossways in the pipe feet planted against the far side helping to push his weight back
and keep him out of the water trickling down the middle He leans his head back

The elbow in the pipe is only faintly illuminated by daylight from the distant mouth now hidden
around the bend

Far away very muted the sound of the docks carries on

FADE OUT

IN BLACK

A dull distant concussion All low end its ring-out does not go away The vibration goes on
and on

Muldrow opens his eyes
Another dull boom

The pipe elbow in front of him shows the faintest dullest flickering red—a reflection of a
reflection

Another dull boom the explosions are now joined by the whine of sirens
Muldrow rounds the tum in the pipe and looks

The mouth of the pipe presents a small circle of harbor which now consists of red caps dancing
atop the agitated water A more vivid red-a reflection of fire o

BOOM-a nearer explosion still all low end but quite loud knocks Muldrow off his feet Water
slurps in the pipe the length of which has been set trembling

Muldrow climbs to his feet smiling and whoops 1 His voice echoes along the pipe He scoots in
his crouch down towards its mouth

EXTERIOR

As Muldrow lets himself drop down onto the stairs

A bend in the harbor gives him a view of the city of Tokyo burning Lights rake the sky
occasionally catching an overflying plane

White phosphorous and red napalm bloom here and there each explosion followed seconds later
by a dull concussive boom The red light now direct is intense Now audible over the sirens
and explosions is the drone of the bombers

Five bombs hit in a line and a sheet of flame a mile wide shoots up into the sky Now the whole
city appears to be on fire

A bomb hits the docklands collapsing one of the cranes A river of flame spills the sea wall and
shoots over the water as the petroleum napalm ignites

Muldrow’s face flickers red in the light of the burning city He starts to run toward the source of
the light

Close on his feet shows his GI boots running over the sand Smoke like low ground fog creeps
in and eddys around his running feet

A low moaning sound like a wind but lower and darker than the wind fades up as he
approaches the light

Oncoming people are starting to pass him now fleeing the city They moan and whimper—small
pieces of the larger tone emanating from the center of the fire No one looks at Muldrow

He is leaving the beach and jogging along a street still heading against the tide of people
towardthe heart of the fire The oncoming people are more numerous now--a stream

A napalm explosion blows fire out a building just in front of him and into the street Its
concussion punches an oncoming woman forward and off her feet to slam directly into
Muldrow chest to chest as if shot by a cannon

Both Muldrow and the woman grunt at the impact Muldrow is knocked onto his back the
woman is on top of him

The woman scrambles to her feet whimpering and continues on her way

Muldrow too gets to his feet The way in front of him is now blocked by flaming wreckage
among which bodies also burn Muldrow takes a side street

He is still running against the tide He passes a woman who is crouched over a prostrate man

shrieking The man is on fire but not dead Muldrow looks as he passes The man is about his
size a

Muldrow slows to look at the mans feet They bicycle against nothing His pants and shoes are
burning Muldrow resumes his run

The smoke now whips alternately in and away obscuring everything and then abruptly parting to
reveal the stream of oncoming faces Muldrow is jostled he now has to fight his way forward
He seems to be in the very middle of the low moaning sound

Muldrow pushes on looking side to side at the people who pass none of whom look at him

Smoke whips in whips away to reveal an oncoming man a little larger than most about
Muldrow’s size Muldrow works himself into the mans path and when they meet stiff-arms
him backwards

The man grunts surprised and looks at Muldrow His eyes widen Muldrow’s left hand rises to
push upwards on the mans chin and his right hand rises with the 45 There is a flat CRACK as
Muldrow shoots upward from under the mans jaw The noise is audible but not remarkable in
the chaos

The mans backward sag is arrested as Muldrow grabs a fistful of shirt and pulls He stoops to
let the man flop forward onto him and then straightens holding the man in a firemans carry

He works his way through the crowd to an alley mouth

In the empty alleyway he dumps the man carelessly to the ground The streets at either end are
teeming with people flowing in the same direction None has a sideward look

Muldrow takes off the mans shoes takes off his boots puts the shoes on a good fit

He feels the mans pockets digs into the one that seems to hold something He sorts through the
contents in his open hand--some odd looking coins and bills a metal ring that appears to be a
token of some kind with an hexagonal hole punched in it a clipping from a newspaper another
piece of paper with handwriting on it and an odd rather archaic looking key like a jailers key
He drops each object drop to the ground in turn after looking at it

He squats and rubs his hand thoughtfully against the wall just in front of him He looks at the
hand blackened with soot feels it between his fingers He smears some on his face gathers
some more smears some more

He straightens and wades back out into the street

It is now almost impossible to move against the tide The crowd surges back and forth
Muldrow notices that now many people hold handkerchiefs pressed against their faces He grabs
one from an older man whom his own shove and the swirling tide quickly moves away he
presses it over his own face

The concussive boomnis throughout the city are now punctuated by one immediately nearby It
combines with the shattering of glass Muldrow looks up

The windows of the building to the right are blowing Through a third-floor window a flailing
man is ejected it is difficult to tell in the confusion of his movement but it seems that he is
missing an arm He crosses the street somersalting three stories high to crash in shower of
sparks through a window of the facing building

There is no freedom of movement in the crowd Muldrow now submits to it It is moving
steadily one way but then whipsaws and eddies there are screams from up ahead

People are trying to make way shoving desperately towards the side of the street to clear the
middle A screaming horse is galloping through Napalm bums in patches along one of its
flanks The horse eyes rolling knocks down and chums up someone unable to get out of its
way After it passes the crowd folds back in its wake

The crowd is bearing Muldrow into an open area away from the burning buildings Itisa park

The crowd in front of him is dropping downward Muldrow stumbles forward and down with
them he looks down

His feet are in water The crowd has been surging toward a pond in the center of the park
The pressure from behind him moves him deeper into the pond In front of him the moans are
turning into screams here and there as people are forced into water over their heads Those who

cannot swim thrash and flail trying to force their way back

Muldrow is caught between those in front trying to push back and the much stronger pressure
from behind to keep going He along with his neighbors is losing his footing on the lakebed

He stumbles and recovers his head soaked
An old woman nearby looks at him He is very white Their eyes make contact
As she starts to scream Muldrow takes out his knife

The woman is losing her footing As she continues to scream she thrashes

Flailing bodies are all around them The womans being bome away from Muldrow going
deeper into the pond “

People she tries to grab fight her away
Muldrow watches as partially hidden in the confusion of bodies she struggles to stay afloat
She is churned under resurfaces only briefly there is a rolling flash of her eyes perhaps looking

at him and she is again swallowed by the water

The lake is a vision out of the Inferno as the city burns around it Crowds continue to stream
into the water where they thrash and flail like condemned souls

Muldrow churns in the water working his way toward the center where it is a little calmer
Dead bodies float around him He lies back in the water and looks up at the sky

The sky is a glowing flickering red We hear a distant hum growing louder and the moaning

of the crowd fades away The B-29’s in wing formation are droning placidly home silhouetted
against the glowing sky

DAY ROAD
The day is gray and hazy with smoke

Muildrow face darkened once again trudges along a road on the outskirts of the city in an area
that is almost rural There are many other pedestrians

Unlike the night before it is quietno conversation even no industrial noise no bird twitters
The only sound is the sluggish scuffle of feet

Muldrow notices something

The house to one side—one among the many small square houses separated by yards that line the
street--has a fighter plane parked in front of it like a car parked ina suburban driveway

There is a shout up ahead Muldrow looks

A man in the road thirty yards up is squatting to pick up a stone He rises and pegs the stone at
something at the side of the road in front of him shouting again

A cumbersome bird with a large wingspan flaps awkwardly away a length of intestine swaying
from its beak

Muldrow keeps walking

A putt-putt noise from behind him Muldrow turns moves to make way

A fighter plane is chugging up the road As it passes Muldrow has a glimpse of the pilot a
bleary-eyed young man -whose-jaw hangs open as he bounces along

The plane makes an awkward right turn at a street ahead its wide turn radius making it clomp up
off the road and then back down again Muldrow watches it chug away

His gaze shifts slightly

To the right in the general direction of the bearing of the plane a Zero drifts down through the
sky with a faint drone its outline softened by haze Its angle of descent implies an airstrip in the
middle distance hidden from us by an intervening hill

Muldrow looks wearily about He leaves the road to his left

He is going behind one of the houses to hide himself from the road He sinks to the ground
sitting with his back against the wall He takes out a chocolate bar eats half of it then carefully
rewraps it in its foil He licks his fingers examines them to make sure he has gotten everything
He puts the chocolate away

He takes out his compass He aligns the needle with the N and looks where it points

A range of hills The haze gives no great visibility beyond

He puts the compass away He glances about notices something

The tail of an airplane parked beside the house

He rounds the side of the house shoots a glance at the road no passersby at the moment

He climbs uncertainly onto the airplane’s wing looking for unfamiliar handholds

Another glance at the road and he climbs into the cockpit

He sits heavily into the pilot’s seat He sits still for a moment gazing out through the
windshield

He looks down at the controls

Switches gauges dials a stick Japanese characters half obscured by grime

He grips the guns on either side
He stares out gripping the guns

At length he hoists himself out of the cockpit

HILLS
Muldrow is walking The hills are covered with low scrub

A distant bird noise Muldrow looks
Up ahead slightly to the left something floats in the air its shape softened by haze It abruptly
confirms the bird sound by starting to flap its wings It is descending Its trajectory will take it
out of sight beyond a group of hills to the left

Muldrow adjusts his course

MINUTES LATER
Muldrow tops a rise and looks down

Cottonwoods line the bank of a small swiftly flowing river

edge of the chocolate with his front teeth He chews for a long time savoring the one piece he
has allowed himself as he proceeds with the fishhook

He tears off a roughly rectangular piece of foil and pushes the hook through the middle of it He
twirls the hook again the foil glinting

He rewraps the bar sticks it in his pocket

He lets the twine play out of his fingers and into the stream

LATER

Muildrow is just rising from a half crouch ankle-deep in the stream His right hand is raising
high the twine his left grabs after the flapping fish being hoisted from the water

After a couple of vain grabs at its wriggling tail Muldrow uses the line to swing the fish onto the
bank He gets out his knife while he waits for it to suffocate

He squats over it and waits patiently as it flops on the ground less and less energetically Its
gills flare relax Its one visible eye goggles

It stops moving

Muldrow picks it up and after it gives one or two weak flops unhooks it He draws the knife
up its belly and carefully cleans it scraping its glistening organs out onto the ground He scales
it He puts a stick through its mouth

He squats by the makings of a fire he has prepared dried pieces of scrub and smaller and larger

sticks He pulls out his flints expertly strikes them gets a spark which starts a dried leaf
crinkling He quickly but gently blows on the leaf nursing it along

Muldrow is finishing eating the fish He has gotten just about all of the flesh
He examines the head He stares at the eyeball which seems to return the stare

Muldrow uses the tip of the knife to coax the eyeball out of its socket He sticks it in his mouth
back between his molars

He bites down on it experimentally feeling it pep between its teeth He chews slowly carefully
feeling the texture

He is suddenly alert at a noise
It is a rustling from the brush a clinking sound accompanies it

After a moment a dog emerges It is very gaunt its ribs visible It advances hesitantly towards
Muldrow head ducked below its shoulder in a submissive attitude

Muldrow tosses the fish head over to where the entrails lie near the dog The dog sniffs at the
head sniffs at the entrails After a couple of tentative feinting bites it picks up the stomach in
its teeth brings it deeper with a jerk of the head chews swallows It laps up the heart chews
swallows tail wagging

Muildrow
Here dog

The dog advances again its movement still accompanied by the metallic clinking sound As it
reaches him Muldrow gives it a pat too reassure it then reaches under its neck to feel

it has a collar The source of the clinking is a couple of tags which Muldrow examines
The little metal discs are engraved with Japanese characters

Muldrow lets them drop

The dog goes back to the entrails

It picks up the head and trots away with it downriver tail wagging

DUSK -
Muldrow is near the crest of another hill the area now lightly wooded
He halts near a boulder that will give shelter on one side He walks around it

He picks a side kicks at the ground clearing away some loose stones He looks around

Bird calls Breeze through the treetops

Muldrow sits leaning against the rock He takes out-the chocolate bar unwraps it takes a bite
licks his fingers rewraps the chocolate puts it away

He looks at his legs sticking out in front of him

NIGHT

We are looking up The dark shapes of trees recede upward The sky is now clear we can see
stars where they are not blotted by leaves

Muldrow is lying on his back hands clasped behind his head staring The background of bird
calls is different now—night birds

Muldrow closes his eyes After a moment he opens them and sits up He reaches in his pocket
and takes out his forty-five caliber army-issue gun

He turns it over in his hand looking at it

He gets up walks over to the edge of the clearing of trees then hunches over and brushes away
the leaves and ground cover He uses the barrel of the gun to dig a shallow hole in the dirt

He carefully places the gun in the hole and covers it back up

He goes back to his spot and lies down and looks back up at the trees He closes his eyes

After a long hold

WHITE

The sound background drops out completely at the cut We are in perfect quiet looking at a ©
field of unbroken white oe oe

We begin to hear a swishing sound very faint but growing Footfalls but not sharp ones
At their loudest point a figure enters in the foreground It is Muldrow wearing snowshoes and
carrying a long Inuit spear He recedes into the background defining the snow-covered ground

by the tracks his snowshoes leave Nothing else distinguishes ground from sky on this overcast
day

The sound of swishing footfalls recedes with Muldrow We hold as he grows small
BLACK

Ambient sound comes back with this cut birds wind There is a new sound chanting With it
a faint ratcheting sound

MULDROW
He opens his eyes

His point of view is of the same upward stretching trees The sky beyond them is now starless
however and starting to take on color

MINUTES LATER
Muldrow reaches the topof the hill and looks down The chanting is slightly louder here

There is a wooden temple in the glen below Only one monk in saffron robes is visible the
chanting—many male voicescomes from inside the temple

The monk outside is spinning a prayer wheel the source of the ratcheting sound

LATER

Now full daylight Muldrow is finishing climbing a series of agricultural terraces scrambling up
steeply banked earth to arrive at the top level

He pauses panting to look around
Below him tiny bobbing hats are signs of people working the terraces None are nearby
A faint and brief flapping sound Muldrow has to look about to locate its source

Just at eye level just at the horizon an irregular round shape jigs slightly as if on air currents It
is not otherwise perceptibly moving

Suddenly wings extend to flap briefly with the same sound and then tuck back in

It is a bird its distance difficult to gauge because its course is directly at us It alternately flaps

and glides flaps and glides As it grows closer we seéthat it is a swan

And as it approaches its great size becomes more apparent It keeps to its bearing straight at
Muldrow

At the last moment in a glide with the subtlest movement of its body it swerves to avoid
collision with Muldrow and then having passed it swerves back to resume its path

Muldrow watches it recede flapping and gliding

WIDE

On a pond at the foot of a grassy lawn Dozens of swans glide gracefully across the water Most
of them are concentrated at one end of the pond where an old man crouches at the waters edge
feeding them

We appear to be in some kind of park or preserve A small hut with a pagoda style roof
probably the caretakers house stands at the edge of the pond

Muldrow stands at the far edge of the lawn observing
We watch the old man from behind as he hunches forward throwing grain out onto the water

A shadow falls over the water in front of him We have not heard any sound Several of the
swans crane their necks to look toward the shore

The old mans back tenses and he freezes but does not look around Muldrow’s arm enters the
frame grabs the man by the back of the neck and forces his head down under the water

The old man feebly beats the water but is to weak to offer much resistance The swans glide
away from the churning water but continue to paddle serenely around the old man pecking at
the grain that floats on the surface of the pond

MOMENTS LATER

At the cut a cacophany of honking and splashing water

Muldrow is waist deep in the pond wielding a short heavy stick clubbing the swans

The swans at the periphery move only to the extent that they are crowded out by the retreating
swans near the middle They bunch up in confusion

Muldrow has clubbed several swans dead but by now the others have edged back out of reach
As the nearest one heavily flaps its wings and starts to rise from the water Muldrow lunges and
grabs snagging a retreating leg in one hand and a handful of flapping wing in the other

With a honk the bird-twists around and bites Muldrow’s face It has locked onto his cheek It
will not let go

Muldrow lets go of the wing and still holding onto its leg grabs the bird by the neck and tries to
pull it off

The bird is batting its powerful wings buffeting Muldrow’s head while maintaining its grip on
his flesh

Muldrow tries to snap its neck The swan twists again releasing Muldrow’s cheek and trying
vainly to bite down at the hand

Muldrow plunges the bird into the water As he holds it there its flapping wings churn the water
Muldrow’s tensed arms waggle with the activity of the bird

Finally it subsides Muldrow his cheek heavily bleeding pulls up the dead swan It drips and
sags its head a lolling weight at the end of its long neck

CARETAKERS CABIN

Muldrow sits at a low table ripping fistfuls of feathers from the carcass of a swan He stuffs
them into a sack

A fire has been built in the fireplace A hich grate apnarentlv a brasier sits ahove the fire

Having finished plucking the bird Muldrow brings the carcass to the fire The bird is huge an and
without its feathers rather grotesque It barely fits onto the grate

Its head lolls off the edge Muldrow takes out his knife and with a few sawing motions takes off
the head

He looks around for a place to toss it

CABIN EXTERIOR

The door opens and Muldrow tosses the head out into the yard

In the pond nearby the swans have resettled and placidlly glide back and forth

TRACKING THROUGH TREES

It is not a natural wood but a grove of trees planted in evenly spaced rows The trees are
straight tall and limbless Their shadows in the afternoon sun create a geometric pattern on the
ground that complements the trees own pattern As we pass by our forward motion makes the
lines of trees hypnotically stretch and contract stretch and contract

Muldrow is walking with the bag of feathers slung over his shoulder

A house--a large house-is surrounded by lawn at the end of the grove

Muldrow pauses at the edge of the grove

In the clearing in front of the house an elderly couple are strolling together in the sunshine The
man is perhaps sixty He wears a long black robe some kind of house coat and his fine graying
hair is pulled up in a top knot

Instead of walking behind him in the Japanese fashion his wife or nurse walks beside him
their arms locked together as they walk Neither speaks Muldrow waits

LATER

It is late afternoon There is no more direct sun

Muldrow edges up to a window of the house and looks in

Inside the old man sits crosslegged on a tatami mat before a low table eating A panel is slid
open and the woman we saw earlier appears to clear an empty plate from before the man ‘She

leaves through the same panel reappears with another plate a °

She sets it on the table and leaves again The man reaches out with one hand and has to locate
the plate by touch before reaching with the chopsticks in his other hand to eat from it

Muldrow watches intently

The mans eyes stare fixedly as he eats not tracking the chopsticks as they travel from the plate
to his mouth He is blind

Muldrow turns from the window and sits with his back against the side wall of the house resting
in the shadows He looks back across the clearing

Black birds circle silently above the trees

Muldrow smiles faintly and closes his eyes

BLACK
A noise a door opening and closing
Muldrow opens his eyes The birds are gone He peers around the comer of the house

The woman is leaving Muldrow watches as she walks away across the clearing and into the
grove and dissappears

INTERIOR HOUSE
Muldrow enters
He is in a hallway he slides a panel to his right to enter a room

It is the room he was watching from outside The old man sits at the low table his back to us

We icmatianlorr hic cHlinerr np ranntan narhonn ta tha wainn of Athenee 2

pieces of bambooperhaps for calligraphy small jars tf dark fluid—perhaps ink

As Muldrow pokes through the contents of the drawer he shoots the occasional glance back at
the old man The man sits frozen exactly as before still holding his chopsticks still listening

Muldrow pushes the top drawer shut and opens the larger one underneath This drawer contains
fine and neatly folded clothes of indeterminate gender Muldrow feels through the fabric less
interested in the clothes themselves than in whatever else might be underneath them

The songbird twitters

Muldrow glances back at the table and freezes

The old man is not there

He has disappeared without a sound Muldrow’s search has itself been too quiet to cover any but
the slightest noise

Muldrow straightens from the drawer still looking at the space now vacant where the old man
had been He notices something

On the table the mans chopsticks have been neatly placed on their little enameled rest

Muldrow looks across the room Not only has the old man left he has closed the screen behind
him

Muldrow crosses the room and pauses for a moment in front of the screen listening Nothing
He reaches under his tunic and takes out his knife

Slowly noiselessly his arm at full length to put some distance between himself and the screen
he slides it open

For a long beat he stares at the open screen waiting He sees nothing he hears nothing

He edges forward and peers around the screen

The long hallway through which he entered is rather dim now and is empty The flooring is
natrow bands of polished wood and the hallway is lined by the same sliding panels of laquered

paper all of which are closed

Quietly quietly Muldrow starts down the hallway his knife at the ready Moonlight glints off
the polished floor and the wooden frames of the the sliding panels

As he makes his way down the hall each footfallis carefully planted and noiseless

One band of wood gives ever so slightly under Muldrow’s right foot and faintly squeaks Aside
from the wind it is the only sound that has broken the quiet Muldrow stops his right foot still
planted and supporting his weight

He looks down at the floor Still looking down he slowly starts to shift his weight to move
forward

As his weight shifts the board groans again We hear a faint whoosh

Muldrow looks up

A panel has slid open and the old man is emerging preceded by a quickly flashing blade The
sword snick-snick-snicks through the air as the man snaps his wrists and advances towards
Muldrow

Muldrow stumbles back unprepared as the flurry of sword swipes abruptly ends and the old
man is frozen in a defensive posture crouched perfectly balanced sword held over his head at

the ready listening

Neither man moves Muldrow staring at the Japanese man the Japanese man expressionlessly
listening Muldrow looks at his own shoulder

He has been cut the fabric at his shoulder has a small rent around which blood seeps
Muldrow looks back at the old man A silent beat

With no audible cue the man explodes into motion again sword slicing the air in front of him as
he advances

Muldrow retreats and swipes a screen open to enter another room The scrape of the panel has
cued the old man and the whisk of his slicing sword abruptly stops

Muldrow is inside a new room staring at the open panel giving out onto an empty patch of
hallway

Perfect quiet

With a snap of paper the sword blade appears through the pane next to the open panel barely
missing Muldrow like a magicians sword probing a trunk It immediately disappears

Perfect quiet again Left behind in the paper pane is a slit the breadth only of the blade now

gone

Muldrow edges further back towards the center of the room

YT 22-0 LLL - aoe

He cups his hand under the cuff

Plip-plip-plip--fainter but still audible we hear the blood dripping into his palm
The old man explodes into motion again

Muldrow can only dodge the reach advantage of the old mans sword relative to Muldrow’s
knife makes it impossible to attack

The old man advances in pace with the retreating footsteps Muldrow half-falls half-rolis he is
under a table and bumps its leg

On the table a clay pot tips over with a clunk Spilled earth patters onto the tabletop and onto
the hollow floor

The old man reacting to the noise turns and swipes at the source of the noise Muldrow is
rising to his feet next to him

A distant clunk The man is turning again but Muldrow has his opening he stabs the man in the
neck He has hit the jugular there is projectile blood around the knife which remains planted in
the mans neck

The distant clunk was the front door which now closes There is an inquiring female voice

The old man continues to cut and slice Muldrow backs away and waits

The old mans bload is pattering onto the floor His action is becoming graceless unsteady

He sinks to-one knee still holding the sword two-handed

One hand drops from the sword As the old man sways he reaches up and pulls the knife from
his neck

With a clank he drops the sword to the floor He reaches up with his second hand now free to
feel the knife examining its unfamiliar shape

There are approaching footsteps and the female voice repeats its inquiry closer now
The old man opens his mouth to respond All that emerges is a windy rattle
He tips over and is still

Muldrow stoops over him and takes the knife from his hand

The door opens and the woman looks in

LATER

It is now day Muldrow is back in the front room carefully working on something with needle
and thread The songbird twitters

As he flips the fabric around turning a comer it becomes clear that what he holds is some sort
of thin jacket He is sewing a lining onto it

Before sewing it completely closed he picks up the bag of feathers holds the opening down
between lining and jacket and pats the underside of the raised bag to pour feathers into the
lining He pats at the coat distributing the feathers evenly through the lining Escaped feathers
float through the air

He picks up the needle again to sew the lining shut

VARIOUS CUTS

Muldrow is looking through the house for whatever might be of use Each room is neatly
arranged and now disarranged by Muldrow’s search He looks through drawers closets shelves

One room houses books and scrolls Muldrow pauses before a picture on a desk

It is a young soldier in an old picture--probably the old man He is wearing round rimless
glasses He is in some kind of dress uniform with a sword in scabbard at his side

Muldrow moves on and for some reason gathers up an armful of books He is about to leave
the room with the books when something else draws his attention

One shelf in a bookcase is bare it is used as a space to display a map The map has a great
degree of topographical detail apparently it is the immediate locality

Muldrow sets the books down studies the map
He pulls out his own silk map
He studies coastline tracing it with a finger He matches the large contours of the detail map

with the scaled-down contours of his own map He places himself midway up the main island
from Tokyo or perhaps a bit less

His eyes continue to wander over the detail map °

His attention is drawn by an irregular north-south line It has diagonal cross-hatches like sutures
along its length It is railroad

Muldrow gazes

PUSHING MULDROW

He is walking up the hallway towards the front room books once again in hand stepping over
the legs of the woman that trail out of the potting room into the hallway

FRONT ROOM

Muldrow dumps the books onto the floor He rips out several pages from one and crumples
them

He gets out his flints He strikes them over the crumpled paper

A few attempts bring a spark Muldrow quickly hunches to blow on the paper crinkling where
the spark landed

He is nursing it along when a sound stops him the twitter of the bird He looks over
The bird hops up onto its perch cheeping

Muldrow straightens and goes to its bamboo cage He taps aside the little bar that keeps its door

Muldrow is at the foot of the yard walking toward us Behind him flame is beginning to climb
the front wall of the house

Muldrow stares back not moving The train chugs
The old man gapes not moving
The doorway empty-now Muldrow has vanished

The old man still staring

LATER

Muldrow sits next to the empty tracks We hear a distant whistle

In the distance another train is approaching this one pulling long flatcars stacked with freshly
cut timber

HIGH LOOKING DOWN

Timber runs longways through frame jiggling and clunking with the motion of the train
Muldrow enters with his bag sits then stretches out lying on his back body oriented with the
timber snug between a long hump of wood on either side He tucks the bag of feathers behind

his head as a pillow He gazes up

His point-of-view shows sky Pointing towards it from either side are pine trees that stretch up
and steadily march through frame with the progress of the train

Muldrow relaxes folds his arms behind his head His body rocks with the car and its cargo

MULDROW

In a dim interior still rocking with a gentle motion still enveloped by machine hum A different
machine though--and Muldrow is now wearing a flight suit with a parachute strapped to his
back

A droning voice is barely audible over the airplanes shuddering engines
Voice

It’s fucking cold you hit the air it’s cold out so your first impulse is to tense
up That don’t help though Gotta relax

a nee

Muldrow is on a bench next to other boys in flight suiis all looking towards the front of the
plane

There standing by an almost painfully bright open hatch the jump instructor continues

Instructor
All right you fucking ladies How many of you still walk around holding
your fucking dicks None of you Well you don’t hold onto the ripcord either
Leggo the fucking thing

Several of the boys drop their hands from where they have been nervously clutching the metal
ring

Like your dick Grab it when you wanna use it Til then don’t worry it’s
there Okay we hop off by platoon Platoon leader first two-second intervals
This is your first practice jump This is your last practice jump The brass figures
we shouldn’t kill too many a you in practice That ladies would be pointless
Okay Hit the air spread your arms or youll keep tumbling Arms spread
stabilize once you’re steady don’t flap you’re not a fucking bird Okay you’re
ready to deploy You grab your primary You pull That don’t open you grab
your secondary you pull That don’t open we got a procedure you write a letter
to the Air Force to complain Any questions

The boy closest to the hatch leans over and vomits
Okay no questions Upsy-daisy ladies it’s been a pleasure
The boys stand
We track Muldrow as he advances slowly toward the door
In front of him each boy jumps at a tap from the instructor
The line stops ee

One boy stands frozen in the hatchway arms stretched up fingers hooked around the upper
frame of the hatch A second tap he will not move

The instructor pushes the boy screams and his body bows out but he still doesn’t jump The
instructor has to shout to be heard over the rush of air

Instructor
GET THE FUCK OFF THIS AIRCRAFT SON

He curses reaches up and pries the boys fingers loose gives him the shoulder The line
procedes

Muldrow is in the open hatchway now Bright windy Muldrow looks down A tap on the
back ne

He jumps
As he tumbles he is immersed in a deafening but pitchless rush of air
He throws his arms out and stabilizes but is still whipped by buffeting winds

His shaking point-of-view shows abstract earth far below mostly green One or two little
plumes of white--parachutes—are opening

The intensity of the buffeting--the flap of his flight suit—the roar of the wind—are increasing
The all-powerful rushing sound almost but not quite covers an insistent ching-ching-ching
Muldrow’s altimeter

Arm shaken by wind Muldrow reaches unsteadily for his own chest He finds the ring pulls it
A snap of silk like a thunderclap brings a cut to
Silence
White
Our view is still aerial but now steady floating rather than shaking
Only the faint chinging of the altimeter has echoed over the cut and it gradually dies away
We are in Alaska high up looking down
Mountains glide beneath us snow outcropping rock
Quiet
A great crash accompanies a short cut
Boots into earth body landing flapping silk—

Muldrow opens his eyes His body is rocking The great crash has reintroduced the clack of the
train

He looks curiously down at his own body
Snow thinly layers his shirt though it is not now snowing
Muldrow props himself on his elbows

Each long log is now also patterned with snow thickest at the top of its curve tapering down the
sides

Muldrow gets to his knees looks out at the countryside

Evening’s last light is retained by the fresh snow thinly layering the ground

LATER

It is night Muldrow rides atop the shuddering logs with his knees hugged to his chest gazing
out at the passing scenery

His point-of-view shows lights intermittently flashing through the intervening trees we are
passing a town or small city Here the tree limbs are more heavily laden with snow

With a screech of steel the train starts to brake Muldrow throws a hand out to brace himself
From the locomotive far ahead there is a brief whistle blast The train with sounds of metal
stress gradually slows to a stop

Muldrow rises and looks forward All thats visible in the dark of night is the ghostly line of
trees retreating on either side

There is a rumble of several beats duration The rumble is from some distance away its
vibration however generates rocks and squeaks the length of the train

A moment of silence ss

The train abruptly lurches into motion again Muldrow almost loses his balance grabs a stake to
one side to steady himself Metal screeches again but the train is not really accelerating after a
slow huffing advance of a few yards it stops again

Silence and then a repeat of the distant rumble Now very faintly we hear voices

Another brief advance of the train which Muldrow is this time prepared for As the train once
again stops he can now make out some activity around a stakebed car many cars ahead Under a

harsh unshielded worklight men are moving at the side of the train

As the fence siding on the stakebed car is sprung and swings down its cargo of timber with a
great vibrating rumble rolls out and down an incline at the side of the tracks

The train lurches into motion again When it stops this time Muldrow vaults off the back side
of the car

He pads across the deserted tracks on the far side of the lurching cars across the newly fallen
snow

OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN

It is deserted and only dimly lit by by street lights Muldrow walks in the shadows hugging the
low buidings

Up ahead headlights sweep a tum and a Japanese Army six-by-six rounds the corner and cruises
silently towards him

Muldrow puts his head down and keeps walking The truck approaches and Muldrow sneaks a
look to the side as it glides quietly past tires squeaking on the snow Under the truck beds
canvas canopy soldiers sit dozing

The truck has left tire tracks in the fresh snow up the center of the street Muldrow listens for
the sound of the truck receeding behind him but the snow has muffled everything After a
moment he risks a look back

The truck taillights are receding silently up the street

Still walking Muldrow watches back over his shoulder for a beat and then as he looks forward
finds that he is facing

An old woman in black a sack over her shoulder She has been bearing silently down the center
of the street having appeared out of nowhere though the street is straight and her footprints
stretch straight behind her she is closer than seems consistent with Muldrow’s brief look back—
perhaps ten feet away

Both he and the woman stop too surprised to do anything but stand and stare at each other each
holding a sack--a distorted mirror image

She opens her mouth still staring at him

He holds up a calming hand

She screams-a dry rasping scream that stands out in the snow-muted quiet
Muldrow looks back around

Up the street the truck has stopped With a faint grinding of gears it starts to turn
Muldrow looks quickly about and runs

Before plunging into an alley his brief look up the street shows

A few soldiers hopping out of the back of the truck as it finishes its U-tum the truck then
starting to accelerate towards him

He heads up a narrow alley bordered on either side by high wooden fencing
Truck sounds and then agitated voices stand out in the quiet behind him

He gives a door in the alleyway his shoulder it does not give

A brief glance shows that the truck is entering the alley

He resumes his sprint toward its far end

He corners onto the intersecting street and starts backtracking along it

Two soldiers rifles held loosely across their chests appear around the comer ahead and trot
towards Muldrow having made the run across an alley parallel to his

One of them shouts what is clearly a command at Muldrow Both men ready their guns

Behind Muldrow the truck is emerging from the alley

Muldrow slows to a walk looks in front looks behind

The pair of soldiers in front lower their rifles as they see that Muldrow no longer means to flee
Muldrow and the men walk towards each other at the repeat of the Japanese command Muldrow
shrugs incomprehension puts up his hands

As he meets the two soldiers one abruptly swings his rifle stock up into Muldrow’s face

BLACK

In the black there is engine noise

MULDROW
Rocking with the motion of the truck He lies on the floor of the back of the truck

His face is battered blood mixed with saliva leaks from his mouth He struggles to look around
realizes his movement is inhibited

His arms are tied behind his back The soldiers on the U-shaped bench are visible only as pairs
of uniform boots we dont see their faces One of them alerted by Muldrow’s head movement
that he is awake stands unsteadied by the movement of the truck kicks him a couple of times
yells and then reseats himself

The engine noise is a deep rumble we also hear the clink of chain Muldrow now sees that one
pair of boots just next to him is worn by a soldier in leg manacles Muldrow’s eyes shift to look
steeply up

Like Muldrow this soldier has been beaten From his posture and the set of his shoulders it is
clear that he too has his hands bound behind him

The truck is downshifting Some kind of toplight plays down on the beds canvas top The truck
comes to a halt

The trucks gate is lowered An officer less disheveled than the soldiers in the truck is looking
in He speaks a few words to them receives an answer speaks harshly to the prisoner seated by
Muldrow and turns to walk into the background

The prisoner apparently responding to instructions rises and walks awkwardly clinking to the
tailgate Hands bound it is impossible for him to climb down He hesitates either trying to
figure out how to do so or waiting for help

A soldier behind him shoves him forward and he pitches down and disappears to land out of our
view presumably face-first on the ground

Soldiers dismount and one of them grabs a shoulder of the prisoner and half-hauls half-kicks
him toward the officer waiting in the background

A soldier is screaming at Muldrow who does not respond A couple of kicks bring him to his
feet

He goes to the tailgate jumps

EXTERIOR

He lands on pavement and almost keeps his feet but not quite He rolis onto his side More
kicks get him to his feet

He is escorted to where the officer is now screaming at the Japanese prisoner

The prisoner does not respond his head hanging in mute shame The officer hits him in the face
with some kind of truncheon The man staggers but stays on his feet

The officer turns to Muldrow screams at him in Japanese Then two words of English

Officer
What you What you

Muldrow doesnt answer receives a bash in the face

The officer reaches to his neck pulls off his dog tags looks at them He shakes them in
Muldrow’s face shouting something again in Japanese

He paces in front of the two men decides yells an instruction

The Japanese prisoner hunkers awkwardly down to his knees He crouches leaning forward
hands behind his back

The officer repeats the command to Muldrow emphasizing it with another blow to the face
Muldrow kneels drooling blood from his wounded mouth

The officer is drawing a sword

Muldrow looks over at the man kneeling next to him

The man turns his head to look at Muldrow He is quite close Sweat drips off his face His
face is battered his look is neutral

The man looks back down at the ground His breath vaporizes in the air but his sweat continues
to drip onto the cold ground

We hear the WHOOSH of the sword blade cutting the air and the head of the Japanese soldier
seperates from his body and hits the ground with a dull thunk

His neck gouts blood as the body twists slowly and then almost gently relaxes from its kneeling
position to flop into the dirt

Muldrow looks down at the ground The boots of the Japanese officer and the tip of his sword
enter frame He is screaming at Muldrow

The officer’s toes dig in as he plants himself The sword rises out of frame He repeats his
question

After a long silent beat his planted feet relax He issues instructions to the other soldiers

Muldrow is abruptly hauled to his feet and shoved back toward the truck

LATER

Muldrow is once again on the floor of the moving truck

One soldier sits in back now staring at him gun held casually in his lap

Muldrow grimaces and moves his shoulders to relieve the stress on his bound wrists

With this the soldier jumps to his feet and screams at Muldrow as he takes the two steps over to
him The soldier kicks at him Muldrow stops moving

The soldier straightens steadies himself with an arm against the side of the truck reseats
himself

He is staring sourly at Muldrow Muldrow returns his stare
The truck bumps onto an uneven surface continues rumbling along

Muldrow stares at the soldier Now very deliberately it seems he again twists his shoulders as
if to find a more comfortable position It again brings the soldier screaming off the bench He
kicks at Muldrow his gun pointed down at him

Muldrow’s legs are drawn into his chest as if to protect himself from the blows placing himself
in an almost in a fetal position At length the soldier backs away and once again reaches with a
hand to steady himself as he begins to sit down

Just as he starts to sit Muldrow kicks outward as hard as he can There is the crunch of bone and
ligament giving way in the soldiers knee The soldier drops to his good knee in front of the
bench

As he is bringing his rifle around Muldrow kicks out again heel into chest The man is dropping
away out of sight

Muldrow drags himself hurriedly and awkwardly along the floor the mans twisting feet are now
in front of his eyes his body stretching away towards Muldrow’s feet Muldrow kicks
experimentally but with force

He is kicking shoulder he adjusts he kicks the prone mans head as hard as he can many times
The mans neck now gives limply under the blows his feet have stopped writhing

A cautious pause Both Muldrow’s body and the soldiers seem to jog only with the movement of
the truck Muldrow moves to get some distance

With same efforthe sity un Rreathine heavilvhe looks at the nrastrate soldigy

The man is a limp body no sign of life

Muldrow draws his knees up to his chest curling as tightly as he can He angles his heels over
the rope binding his hands uses his feet to push down on and wriggle over the rope

His hands are now in front of him He tilts them this way and that in order to examine the knot
His breath starts to slow

He chooses a spot brings the knot to his mouth and starts working at it with his teeth

MINUTES LATER
Hands free now Muldrow picks up the soldiers rifle and looks at it

It is a bolt action He opens the breech sees it holds a round closes it He looks at the soldiers
body

He stands unsteadily on the bed of the moving truck his back to the tailgate He brings the rifle
to his shoulder and points it at the canvas front of the truckbed towards the cab

He fires He hear the simultaneous phht of canvas and twank of bullet through metal
After the shortest beat the truck brakes hard Muldrow braces himself as it brakes and once the

vehicle is halted draws back into the dark comer of the truckbed his rifle at the ready facing
the rear

ee wg ae eg lg ggg nk tae with the

engine

At length we hear a door of the cab open The truck lists ever so slightly as a man steps out
onto the running board then onto the ground A short beat and then another man steps down

Muldrow sits staring at the patch of road visible over the tailgate
Silence then an enquiring voice from outside

Muldrow sits waiting

The enquiring word perhaps a name is repeated louder

Quiet

A soldier appears at the left comer of the tailgate rifle swinging in firing into the truck Almost
simultaneously the second soldier appears at the right corner also hooking his rifle around

Muldrow’s first unhurried shot is at the soldier on the left and it hits him in the face and flips
him back

He must throw the bolt and his second shot is hurried The man on the right screams and is
swinging his rifle toward him and fires just as Muldrow does

Muldrow’s shot hits the soldier in the chest and makes him drop back out of view Muldrow
apparently unhit goes to the gate throwing the bolt and looks down

The soldier is on his hands and knees beginning to crawl out towards the center of the road
Muldrow fires down on him

The impact slaps the man down onto the road but he still weakly moves Muldrow throws the
bolt again and pulls the trigger

Click Muldrow throws open the breech to look when-- oe

The dull engine rumble and the vibration beneath his feet stops Now there is quiet through
which we hear only forest insects and the liquid breath of the man in the road

Muldrow thinks He looks at the dead man below him to his left His rifle lies on the ground at
the end of his outflung hand

The man to the right is making extremely slow progress into the street his rifle left behind

-—

We cannot feel or hear movement from the cab of the iruck

Muldrow decides He bends down to the soldier inside the truck and pulls his bayonet out of the
scabbard at his belt

He reaches up and slices a vent in the canvas top between two ribs

Still holding the bayonet in one hand he makes the short standing jump up and catches a roof rib
with the other hand He chins himself easily with the one hand reaches to set the bayonet on the
roof outside with the other and then uses both hands to pull himself up onto the canvas
TRUCK EXTERIOR

Muldrow slides to the front of the roof and looks down at the roof of the cab below of him He
sits waits thinks as does no doubt the invisible man below him

At great length a hand reaches out of the left window It cautiously tilts the side view mirror
scanning the road to the side of the truck After a moment the hand withdraws

A head appears the man is looking back at the weakly crawling soldier near the rear of the
truck

Muldrow waits
The top of the mans head is motionless as he stares At length it draws back into the cab

There is a beat and then the faintest squeak of upholstery His hand appears out of the left
window adjusts its mirror The hand withdraws

The door on this side is carefully opened with as little noise-as the soldier can manage A rifle
protrudes and then the soldier himself easing himself down onto the running board

One hand holds the rifle one arm’ extends for balance to the open door as the soldier starts his
step down towards the ground craning to look around towards the back

Muldrow jumps

As he falls on him he tries to plant the bayonet at the junction of the mans shoulder and neck
The two land in confusion in the dirt °

Muldrow’s hand is still wrapped around the bayonet mount the blade of which is in the man’s
body Muldrow twists and grinds The mount snaps off in his hand
— ee

He rises to his feet as does the screaming soldier “Both-of the soldiers hands go up to claw
futilely at the piece of blade projecting from his collarbone

Muldrow stoops for the mans rifle The soldier still screaming steps on it kicks Muldrow
away wee

Muldrow reaches for the mans waist for his own bayonet As the soldier slaps at him
ineffectually with one hand the other still scrabbling at his shoulder Muldrow pulls out the
bayonet He stabs the man with it

With this bayonet planted in his midsection the screaming soldier turns and stumbles down the
roadbed off towards the woods

Muldrow goes to the dead soldier behind the truck and picks up his rifle He goes back to the
roadside at the front of the truck

The receding screams have stopped now there is only the intermittent crackle of brush from the
disappeared soldier Muldrow takes one step off the road in his direction stops decides not to
bother

He goes back to the dead soldier and hauls him to the roadside and sends him tumbling down the
declivity He goes to the second soldier still weakly moving fires down at the back of his head
and disposes of him the same way

INTERIOR CAB

Muldrow climbs in behind the wheel He looks around

The keys are in the ignition His bag of feathers is down in the passenger legwell

He pulls it up rummages inside
He pulls out his map compass knife satisfied that they are still there he stuffs them all back in
He briefly looks over the gear shift and dash He tums the keys in the ignition

The trucks deep rumbling idle resumes With it comes a high tinkling sound

Muldrow looks at the dash

His dogtags hang from a knob vibrating with the truck

69
He slips them off the knob then onto his own neck

He experimentally puts the truck in gear

LATER

It is early morning Muldrow is driving

We are moving through an area of low-lying hills The snow on the ground is deeper here
Muldrow glances at the dash

Some kind of gauge—presumbaly fuelhas a needle pointing about midway

There is an oxcart ahead Muldrow passes it Its drivers broad black hat tums as he passes
looking at the truck It is the only other vehicle on the road

LATER

Later in the day There are intermittent vehicles here it is an industrial area perhaps the
outskirts of a town

The windshield is beginning to fog Muldrow leans forward and wipes it

Smokestacks belch black smoke from the factory-like buildings The road is beginning to fill
with pedestrians bicycle tri-shaws and the occasional battered car or truck that feeds onto the
macadam from loading docks and rough dirt lanes

Muldrow can see that he is about to cross a small suspension bridge into a much busier area He
slows down but there is nowhere to tum off

Behind him a horn sounds and a muddy truck pulls out and passes him

Muldrow looks in the side mirror

What appears to be a bus loaded with workers rumbles up behind him The bus is so full that
workers hang on the running boards or sit on the roof breathing the sooty air through little white

surgical masks

Muldrow accelerates the truck over the suspension bridge

Muldrow is now in the center of a small city Traffic teems all around him but the height of the
cab affords him some protection from being seen

In traffic the truck has slowed to a crawl Muldrow takes the silk map out of his pocket and
with one hand spreads-it-out on the seat next to him

The map shows a city near the top of the island bisected by a river Morioka
There is a sharp rap at the truck door

Muldrow looks up No one is there

He hears a similar rap now some distance away and looks in the side view

A child is walking away down the line of creeping vehicles banging on each with a stick as he
passes

There are more bangs from up ahead
Another child is running toward us also with a stick maybe trying to catch up with his friend

He bangs on the hood of Muldrow’s truck then hops up onto the running board He looks at
Muldrow registers surprise and hops back down

Muldrow twists around trying to find the boy keeping one eye on the traffic in front of him

Suddenly the boy reappears at the window smiling Another boy even younger hops up next to
him

They point at Muldrow jabbering merrily The older boy points his stick like a gun at Muldrow
and makes a firing sound BOP-BOP-BOP-BOP-BOP

They hop down and run away laughing

LATER

Still in town Muldrow glances at his compass on the seat next to him He turns left at an
intersection to make his bearing more northerly

He wipes the windshield fogging over again Up ahead of him is another military vehicle-a
transport somewhat like his own

He looks in the side view More vehicles are joining him behind pulling in from the right He
is in the middle of a military convoy

Lacking an alternative he drives on

LATER
Close on the compass shows that we are still moving north

It is still day but shadows are lengthening We are no longer in the city Muldrow grinds on in
the middle of the convoy

He reaches forward wipes the windshield clean All thats visible is the one truck directly in
front

He rolls down the fogged side window to look at the side mirror Trucks follow behind

The truck ahead is slowing Muldrow downshifts The truck ahead is pulling over slowing
further

Muldrow hand on the gearshift hesitates
He decides he upshifts steers to the center of the road to clear the stopping vehicle
He passes it as it slows to a stop Ahead of it is another vehicle also pulled over

Muldrow glances in the side view The truck behind is slowing pulling over behind the one that
Muldrow has just passed

He is still passing parked vehicles the whole line ahead of him has stopped
He keeps to a steady but not high speed He glances to the side as he passes trucks Soldiers
disembark from some of the cabs casually circling their trucks One or two of them look at his

vehicle as it passes but none it seems with particular concern

He looks in his side view mirror One truck from midway back has not pulled over but follows
in the middle distance

Muldrow keeps to his pace tops a hill descends

After a beat the following truck appears over the same hill starts to descend

Muldrow’s hand vibrates on the gearshift He keeps to‘ius pace keeps one eye on the truck
following at the same speed

At length it tums right onto an intersecting lane and disappears

Muldrow relaxes continues driving

LATER

There is no more direct sun it is near dusk and overcast

The road now is barely a track in the snow It follows the contours of the rolling hills which are
themselves barely defined in the snow Landscape and sky are the same gray tone the dull green
of the canvas-covered truck is the only thing moving and the only object of color in the
environment

A headwind has picked up buffeting the truck and flapping the canvas

At the crest of a hill Muldrow stops the truck climbs out stands in the snow at the side of the
road

He is facing the direction the truck was heading into the wind It beats back his hair makes him
squint makes the canvas snap loudly and continuously

There is nothing to see in front of him but a mist-diffused and undifferentiated gray
The mist damps his face He sticks his tongue out to run it over his upper lip tasting it

He breathes in deeply

INTERIOR TRUCK BED
Muldrow climbs in stretches out on the floor uses the bag of feathers as a pillow

FADE OUT

LATER

Muldrow opens his eyes

The back area of the truck is now an almost glowing green lit by direct sunlight hitting the
canvas

Muldrow sits up listening
A deep steady rhythmic sound Breakers

Muldrow climbs out

EXTERIOR TRUCK

It is morning

As we look at Muldrow in close-up the landscape behind him now looks completely different
Blue clowdless sky meets the land in a hard seam and the white hills are perfectly defined by the
sunlight

The sound of the breakers is sharper here outside the truck Muldrow is looking fixedly off

The reverse shows his point of view Below him is glittering blue sea meeting flat blue sky

Muldrow looks intently

A longer lens point of view shows that the shimmering sea horizon is broken directly in front of
us by a dull grey patch—land softened by great distance

NIGHT

We are close on Muldrow gazing intently at something off He is flat on his belly peering over a
low rise We can faintly hear a clunking bell echoing over water There are voices nearby and
a scraping sound ze v

His point-of-view shows that he is now down at the beach a small gravel beach apparently
protected since there are no heavy breakers here

The voices are from two men one of whom is dragging a small boat off the gravel out into the
water The other man is dumping in fishing nets When the boat is pulled out far enough to be
waterborne the men clamber in A bell mounted on its stern dully clunks a lighted lantern is
mounted on its prow

Beyond them at varying distances out to sea we canste-a few other fishine hoats yisihie an the a

moonless water only by virtue of their yellow lanterns The surface of the water is defined only
by glints of starlight

Muldrow waits for the two men to get some distance out the clunk of their bell receding before
he shows himself and walks onto the beach

Perhaps a half-dozen more small fishing boats are grounded there unguarded Muldrow walks
along the line looking into them He pulls a length of rope out of one boat and drops it into
another along with his bag and drags it into the water its bell thunking

LATER

Muldrow is at sea paddling kayak-style by means of two oars that he has lashed together His
bell clunks with the swell of the sea A few other lantern lights are visible none of them very

close

A Japanese voice stands out carrying with an eery clarity over the surface of the water
Muldrow looks its source must be the nearest lantern light

After a moment the voice repeats its phrase a few extra words thrown in at the end
Muidrow hesitates He sets down the kayak blade and hands on gunwales shuffles toward the “
front of his boat He takes out his flints He opens the lantern door and after a couple of tries

gets it lit He goes back to the stem and resumes paddling He shoots the occasional glance at
the other lantern light All we hear is the placid clung of its bell the voice does not return

LATER

We are close on the familiar omate N of Muldrow’s compass lit by feeble yellow light its
needle wavers and aligns

Wider on Muldrow shows that he is rocking with the motion of the boat not paddling but gazing
down at the compass in his hand which he has tilted forward to catch the lantern light He looks
up from the compass into the sky

His point of view shows stars many stars very bright No moon

Muldrow continues to look

A closer field shows fewer stars one of them is particularly bright-something to navigate by

We hear the sham slap of a wave hitting the side of thé boat and the lantern pitches slightly The

Muldrow still paddling stares at it

The bird abruptly takes flight its wings beating awkwardly at first and then smoothly as it
becomes airborne

It is headed directly away Its dull white shape becomes less and less distinct as it recedes and
then is swallowed by the blackness

The sound of its beating wings has also receded But now Muldrow stops paddling to listen
barely audible over the lap of water against the boat is a familiar low rhythmic sound breakers

SHORE

Muldrow is walking away from the boat which he has left beached

DAY

We are looking at hoofprints in the snow The camera tilts up to reveal the path that the animal
has taken across a snow-covered field and into the woods

Muldrow who has been hunched over examining the prints stands and walks over to a small
sapling He stows his bag under the tree then takes out his knife and strips a long straight
branch from near the base of the tree

LATER

Muldrow walks quietly through the woods stalking the animal In his right handhe holdsa
makeshift spear--his knife lashed to the end of the tree branch

There is a high chirping sound and Muldrow pauses at the edge of a clearing looking up into the
trees

White shorthaired monkeys with puffy muttonchops and startled expressions are hopping from
limb to limb raising a ruckus

Muldrow smiles at the unfamiliar and amusing sight

His attention is drawn by snorting and the sound of many feet galloping through snow

About fifteen shaggy grayish animals that look liké some kind of mountain goat are charging
directly towards him Their horns are lowered as they run Muldrow readies his spear

He picks one out as they draw near—the biggest one--and prepares to stab He reacts to
something odd -

The goat has an arrow buried in its shoulder bobbing with his motion as he runs like a picador’s
lance in a bull Blood flows from the fresh wound

Muldrow stabs at the animal withdraws and stabs again

The beasts around him are milling they start to turn and run the other way in the direction they
came from

The goat injured by Muldrow and the arrow straggles behind plunging with effort through the
snow looking about ready to drop

Muldrow stabs at the animal again from behind There is a loud scream--
Not from the animal It is a human scream It repeats Muldrow looks
Up ahead the other goats are milling and butting at something on the ground

Muldrow runs up and wades in A downed hunter dressed in skins is trying to beat the animals
off Muldrow stabs at the goats they start to disperse

One butts him ineffectually but immediately he is hit from the other side This second goat has
buried one horn in the meaty part of Muldrow’s thigh It waggles its head tearing up the wound
Muldrow screams drops his spear

The goat is pushing up forcing the leg up and almost tipping Muldrow off his feet

Muldrow balls a fist and swings down banging the animal on its snout He places two hands on
top of its head and pushes away a

The goat waggles its head away the horn disengages The goat bounds off
The goats have left the two men are alone
The hunter on the ground unballs himself and stands He does not seem to be badly hurt

He and Muldrow stare at each other

The man is clad in furs and although clearly Japanese is also somewhat aboriginal looking He
is an older man and has a whisp of a white beard and very weathered skin

After a long staring beat he simply turns and walks off through the snow
Muldrow hands clamped to his wound watches him go

He stoops to scoop snow and packs it against his bloodied leg He hobbles over to the goat
which is now dying in the snow blowing loud and bloodied breaths through its nose

Muldrow sinks to his knees behind the animal He draws its head back and slits its throat

MINUTES LATER

Muldrow sits in the same spot eating meat from the dead animal It is partly skinned hide slit
and partly peeled away to expose flesh

He wolfs down the meat barely chewing blood dripping down his face

LATER

The last rays of sunlight are slanting through the trees Limping badly now Muldrow is just
finishing a makeshift lean-to made from branches he has stripped from the surrounding trees

He looks down at his injured leg
A deep puncture wound is still oozing blood out of a purple bruise

Muldrow scoops up another handful of snow and packs it into the wound

MORNING

Sunlight dapples Muldrow as he sleeps in the lean-to He is covered by the blood-crusted hide of
the slain mountain goat

He opens his eyes
Sunlight streams in through the branches and leaves

Muldrow squints against the light

Through the branches eyes—oriental eyes--look back athim Whoever it is is standing very still
Muidrow shifts his eyes to another part of the lean-to
Another pair of eyes --

Muldrow struggles up to his elbows

VILLAGE

Muldrow is being led in on a litter dragged by a horse People come out to look at him as he
passes Their looks are curious not hostile

There are shouts from behind Muldrow the direction in which his horse is traveling He cranes
to look

A dead bear is being dragged on its back in the opposite direction by means of a rope attached to
its bound hind legs As it is pulled along its body leaves a great furrow in the snow

Muldrow’s horse is stopped in front of a hut One of the men escorting him stoops by the litter
and indicates by gesture that he will help him up Muldrow throws an arm over his shoulder

INTERIOR HUT

Muldrow hobbies in with the help of the man and is eased down onto the bed
Muldrow’s head lolis back He looks up

Over his head a huge shaggy bear head is mounted to the wail

We hear the sonorous note of a drum

CLOSE ON A YOUNG MAN
Stripped to the waist wearing only a white loin cloth he is beating on a huge drum

Muldrow is sitting on the ground inside a long low-ceilinged lodge filled with the people from
the village

In the middle of the lodge a man is dancing ina small Giicle clad in bear hides and wearing a
huge shaggy headdress made from the head of a bear

The other villagers clap their hands or shake long poles topped with the skulls of various
animals me

The old man whom Muldrow helped earlier now sitting next to him claps and grins at
Muldrow wanting it seems to encourage him to enjoy the spectacle

While the dancer is still performing two bear cubs are brought in in a cage They pace uneasily
inside

The dancer dances in front of the cubs He chants something at them seeming to ask a question

The celebrants are langhing The old man next to Muldrow laughs as well again checking on
Muldrow to see whether he is enjoying himself

The bear cubs-pace with even more agitation under the attention of the dancer who continues to
chant at them Another man shakes a bow and arrow at the two bears another still reaches into
the cage rattles a beartooth necklace in front of one of the cubs then loops it around its neck

The disturbed cub starts bawling racing from one end of the cage to the other nsing onto two
feet to rest its forepaws against the bars then dropping again to race to the other side

Drink is being passed around Muldrow takes the jug offered by the old man swallows some
and to the old mans amusement reacts to its strength and then passes it on

Someone opens the cage and the cub wearing the necklace is brought out The dancer shakes a
skull at it and chants The cub bawls

The cub is lassoed The celebrants especially the children laugh and clap They follow as the
cub is yanked off its feet and dragged to an upright pole Some of the children are shooting
arrows at it apparently dulled for they merely bounce off

The cub is shoved against the pole which is hung with colored ribbons The dancer has
followed still talking to the bear As he talks other men bring in thick poles which they use to
force the bear up to its feet and chock its head as it is tied in place

They now make way as another man with bow and arrow takes his place a few paces in front of
the bear The dancer backs away from the bear still chanting at it as the archer draws back his
bow and aims

It is a shot to the center of the bears chest It howls and twitches but only briefly and as the

i

audience cheers and the children and some of the mei fish in with clubs and swat at the cub it
is unclear whether they are killing it or it is already dead
MORNING

It is very early morning The village street has the quiet of a morning after

INTERIOR MULDROWS HUT

Muldrow is up and dressed--probably the only person in the village who is He is stropping his
knife

He hunches down and eats a handful of rice from a small earthernware bow that has been
placed by his bed

STREET

Muldrow sticks his head cautiously out of the door to his hut He emerges carrying his bag
walking stiffly

He walks towards the lodge—the villages only large building

INTERIOR LODGE
Muldrow enters
The one bear cub is still in its cage It stirs at Muldrow’s entrance

The only person in the lodge is the old manMuldrow’s friend—who tums to look Seeing
Muldrow on his feet he smiles and claps a welcoming

As Muldrow walks towards the man and the cage the bear cub rises and begins its agitated
pacing

The old man says something to Muldrow and then pantomimes bringing food to his mouth
inquiring if Muldrow is hungry

Muldrow walks up to him and without breaking stride plunges the knife into his neck He
holds it in still for a moment then twists and shakes it He pulls it out and the old man drops

With the gushing of blood the bear cub starts baying Muldrow opens its cage It backs away
Muldrow reaches in and grabs a fistful of fur and hauls it out Once out he kicks it towards the
open door

EXTERIOR

The village street as before except that now the bear cub scampers away toward the woods
kicking up snow as it runs

After a moment Muidrow emerges from the lodge He starts down the street in the same
direction as the bear but hesitates He looks up and down the street

A line of huts one much like the next

Muldrow goes to the nearest one and cautiously opens the door

INTERIOR HUT

It is dim--windows shuttered—and smokey There are shapes of bodies on pallets on the floor
very close to each other Four men asleep

Muldrow squats at the head of one man He looks at the man

The man is lying on his back his mouth open one arm outflung Muldrow covers his mouth
with one hand The mans eyes open and widen Muldrow stabs him in the throat

He moves to the next man

EXTERIOR

After a beat Muldrow emerges from the hut
Again he looks up and down the street

The line of huts

A long considering beat

Muldrow finally tums and walks towards the woods

LATER

It is now full day

We are looking down at snow tracking forward The snowfield is marked by two tracks one set
of tracks is a pair of fresh very defined animal tracks next to it are footprints pointed the same
direction that we are We hear the crunch of feet in the snow and finally overtake the boots that
are leaving the human tracks

A low pulling reverse shows that it is Muldrow gazing down at the animal tracks which he
follows Suddenly he slows puzzled

Our forward track on the ground leaves Muldrow behind as it follows the animal track—which
abruptly ends without disturbance in the snow as if the animal had simply vaporized

Muldrow is stopped looking At length he resumes walking
His footsteps crunch in the snow It is otherwise quiet

The snowfield he is walking in is on a high plain flat and clear of trees Muldrow pulls out his
compass to get a bearing

Close on the compass shows the needle finding the familiar ornate N
Muldrow looks in the direction of the needle

High white mountains

He looks back down at the compass We hear a faint tinkling sound
Muldrow looks up The bell sound though delicate is growing louder

He places the sound looks behind him then back around again as its source shoots over‘his
head

It is a hawk a bell around its neck bearing a dead rodent in its beak It is heading north

LATER

Looking down at the ground tracking again Muldrow is emerging from trees into a clearing

Ahead of him a flap of wings and the bell sound again A disturbed hawk—another one or the
sameis rising from the carcass of a rabbit which it leaves behind

Muldrow watches as it rises and then circles apparently watching him

Muldrow crosses to the rabbit picks up its limp body examines it He resumes walking with
the rabbit

The tinkling hawk seeing that its prey has been appropriated heads north on the same bearing
as Muldrow

A HOUSE

A crude wooden house in a clearing that ends on its far side in a vertical drop Beyond it is sea
Smoke plumes from a hole in its roof

A reverse shows Muldrow halted looking at the house

He starts toward it

INTERIOR HOUSE
As Muldrow pushes open a rough wooden door and steps into the dark interior

The only light comes from a couple of small windows at the front of the house A black cast
iron pot bubbles over a fire on an old wood stove against the far wall

Muldrow crosses the room still holding the rabbit looking at a low wooden table in the center
of the room On it a bowl of rice and a smoking candle

Motion in a dim comer of the room draws Muldrow’s attention

A man sits on the floor swaddled in hides and rags He gets to his feet and moves haltingly to
Muldrow it is clear from his gait that he is old

As he draws near we see that he is clean-shaven unlike the bear people with a brown and
deeply creased face He looks with frank curiosity at Muldrow then down at the rabbit

He asks something Muldrow shrugs The old man points at the rabbit then at the pot

Muldrow
Pll clean ‘er

He flops the rabbit onto the table and sits He takes out his knife and starts skinning it

The old man sits slowly across from him He looks patiently matter-of-factly from Muldrow to
the rabbit he cleans

Muldrow finishes pulling the skin off He guts the animal He cuts the animals head off He
starts slicing the meat off the bone

The old man takes the pieces of meat as they are cut free and drops them in the pot by the table

LATER
The two men are finishing eating

Muldrow rises looks around a little self-consciously then nods at the old man The old man
nods back saying something Muldrow turns and heads for the door

Another word from the old man stops him the old man is getting laboriously to his feet He
shuffles over to Muldrow and plucks his sleeve Hanging onto the sleeve he shuffles to the door
and out into the snow

EXTERIOR CABIN

The old man brings Muldrow around a comer of the cabin

Two enormous hawks are tethered to a wooden perch Leather hoods cover their eyes

Their heads bob at the sound of approaching footsteps and as they do so they sound the small
bells at their necks i

The old man is saying something to Muldrow as he leads the way to the animals He stops and
drapes something like a small leather apron over one forearm

He raises the forearm to the perch He bumps it against one bird’s talons
The hawk responds It steps blindly from the perch onto the old man’s arm

The old man removes the bird’s hood The bird looks around bell tinkling

Muldrow stares

The bird’s head swivels to fix him with its grey-flecked orange eye A lid blinks over it once
twice The head swivels away

The old man is still talking He gently dips his arm

The bird hops off and drops momentarily as it spreads its wings then beats them into flight It
rises circles only briefly and heads south

The old man is still talking as he shuffles back to the front of the cabin He lowers himself
cautiously into a broken down old chair in front of the house in its dilapidated state it tilts his
body back at a comfortable angle like an adirondack chair He closes his eyes and relaxes in the
sun

Muldrow looks back at the bird still on the perch still hooded easing its weight from foot to
foot

LATER

It is late afternoon the sunlight is warmer shadows longer

The old man still sits in the sun in the same beachside posture his flesh almost glowing in the
dying sunlight He opens his eyes

There is the faint bell sound growing louder

The old man stands He flops the leather apron onto his forearm

The returning hawk alights on his arm The old man calls Muldrow over
He is talking again as he talks he points at the bird Muldrow looks

The talons wrapped around the leather guard are slick and red

Muldrow looks up

The bird’s orange eye returns his look blinks its head swivels

Its beak is flecked red a drop of blood collects at its tip and drops

INTERIOR CABIN

It is night Muldrow lies on the ground covered with an animal skin lit only by a flicker from
the stove We hear muttering

The old man is shuffling around the cabin puttering in what is probably a nightly ritual He
mutters to himself as he fusses with this and that Finally he goes to a corner where his pallet is
grunts as he lowers himself onto it pulls a skin over himself and sighs

The cabin is quiet

FADE OUT

EXTERIOR

VW nen elrnciese oc meee 2 ob ’ hee

We are in another high snowfield The falling snéw softens the perimeter of trees making them
ghostlike The mountains beyond are the merest hints of shapes

We hear the faint but now familiar tinkle of the hawk’s bell before we actually see the bird As
the sound grows more distinct the bird materializes in the falling snow

Just over Muldrow’s head it backbeats its wings heavily Muldrow raises his arm to give ita
perch

Its feet descend its talons are about to curl over the leather The instant before they do

There is a dull flat crack Muldrow stumbles backward and falls into the snow dog tags
clinking

The hawk beats quickly upwards
A fast crane up gives its point-of-view of Muldrow spiraling away in the snow below

Close on Muldrow shows him reacting to the shot he has been hit in the chest He looks to the
side

His low angle dutch point-of-view shows men just starting to materialize in the snow walking
towards him

Muldrow looks up
His point-of-view up shows snow falling straight down and the hawk circling above watching
Muldrow (voice-over)

For most of you flight is not in you and never will be in you Even when youre
in an aircraft its not in you But the great thing about birds especially if theyre
predators is that anyone who loves them who understands them his mind his
imagination can fly with them I dont think God himself could ever want
anything more Bs

He looks back down across the field

The same low dutch angle shows the men drawing nearer They carry guns they are soldiers in
white winter gear

Muldrow looks up again at the hawk

An extreme high angle looking down gives the hawk’s point-of-view Snow drops dead away

far below Muldrow lies in the middle of the field as thé’soldiers approach

When I tell you this just say that it came from a voice in the wind a voice
within a voice which doesnt make a sound

We go back to Muldrow His point-of-view shows the soldiers arriving our low angle is
extremely steep on the nearest man who is drawing a sword

T was in the place I tried to get to I was in it and I had it And will be
everywhere in it from now on

The man cocks the sword high over his head There is the tinkle of the circling hawk
You will be able to hear me just like youre hearing me now
He brings the sword down with a great whoosh and on impact we cut to white

You can pick it up any time it snows or even just when the wind is from the
north Everywhere in it for the first time and the last as soon as I close my eyes

The tinkling bell nears

With a whoosh the hawk enters frame It shoots into the background and we slowly pan down
with it as it recedes its shape seftened more and more by intervening snowfall

Our easy adjustment down has brought horizon drifting up into frame distant mountains very
indistinct

The bird too becomes less distinct as it grows smaller smaller and finally merges into the
landscape
