SMELL THE COFFER
FADE IN

EXT SECOND STREET OFFICE BLDG - DAY
An old-fashioned 12-story building in downtown LA
INT BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

BARRY MURPHY 24 emerges from the long line at a chain
store called AHAB’S COFFEE He’s not exactly your Alpha Male
but he inhales the aroma of his coffee with a confident
“today’s my big day” look He punches the elevator button

INT AHAB OFFICE LOBBY DAY (MINUTES LATER)

The top floor is the richly paneled corporate headquarters
of Ahab’s Coffee Barry makes his way to his office

INT BARRY’S OFFICE - DAY

Barry pulls charts marked “e-Coff-e” out of his center desk
drawer (ESTABLISH the metal drawer rolls very easily)
CLARK McCONE 38 his hulking type-A (for Asshole) boss
strides in Barry hides the cards behind him

McCONE
Oh Mr Murphy I hope we didn’t
get you in too early It’s just
that the owner of the whole goddamn
company is waiting

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Barry and everyone else settle At the head of a long table
sits ARMIN AHAB 48 the well-fed founder in a thousand-
dollar suit gold jewelry reeking of fresh-brewed money

AHAB
First off I want everyone to see
the design for our new headquarters

Ahab unveils the model a building shaped like a coffee cup
complete with wavy towers meant to suggest rising steam

McCONEOTHER COWORKERS
BrilliantInspiredHis best yet

Barry who was looking at his charts looks over and bursts
out LAUGHING Then he sees he’s the only one McCone
shoots him a murderous look Ahab looks peeved

AHAB
That’s a Frank Gehry design
BARRY
Oh I wasn’t laughing at that
(grins indicates McCone)
He just told me the filthiest joke

McCone’s jaw drops

AHAB
McCone who the hell is this guy

BARRY

(pumps Ahab’s hand)
Barry Murphy Mr Ahab The guy
who’s about to put you in the
Billionaire’s Club

(whips his chart-cards

onto an easel)
Each day the average Ahab’s
customer waits four minutes for a
coffee six minutes for an
espresso and eight for a latte

McCONE
I’m calling security

BARRY
They’1l take longer than a latte
Now what if Ahab’s could cut each
customer’s wait to under a minute

AHAB
That’s impossible

BARRY

(reveals the next card)
Not with e-Coff-e Every regular
customer is enrolled by e-mail
Coffee preference arrival time
credit card number Their coffee’s
ready and paid for the minute they
walk in The result

Barry whips that card awayto reveal the enraged McCone
who has knocked the easel aside Barry does a take

McCONE
Murphy did I or did I not tell you
this idea had to go through channels

BARRY
If you can’t remember how do you
expect me to

McCone rips Barry’s charts in two Barry is startled
McCONE
For 4 years you’ve tried to showboat
your way to the top And today you
get your big promotion Report to
the shop in the lobby You’re now
VP in charge of coffee stirrers

A ripple of SNICKERS run through the others in the meeting
Deflated Barry turns to slink out Then he pauses

BARRY

Wait a minute I don’t have to
take this

(turns back to McCone)
McCone you’re a waste of skin You
don’t have good ideas or any ideas
You only exist to put down people
who do Youre the kind of guy who
boos at the Special Olympics

McCONE
Oh like I’m the only one

BARRY
Give me my graphics Clark

McCone rips the charts in half again into quarters

McCONE
That’s Mr McCone asshole

Barry karate-kicks McCone in the stomach As McCone doubles
over Barry walks behind him

BARRY
That’s Mr Foot asshole

Barry drop-kicks McCone’s ass right into the Planter He
lies there covered in dirt Ahab leaps to his feet

AHAB
Kid not only do you got brass
balls but e-Coff-e is the best
idea I ever heard in my life Im
giving you ten million for it

Ahab opens a briefcase full of cash A sexy BRUNETTE (we
don’t see her face) runs to Barry He bends her back in a
long kiss as his Coworkers leap to their feet CHEERING He
straightens modestly acknowledges their applause

BARRY
Thanks a lot Now there’s only
one other thing I’d like to do
Barry opens a window and steps out onto the building ledge
Suddenly he’s trembling anxioushe shuts his eyes

AHAB
What are you doing out there

BARRY
(chanting to himself)
Io can’t get hurt I can’t get hurt

EXT BUILDING - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Barry makes a perfect swan-dive off the 12th floor Everyone
rushes to the window to watch him fall -- but Barry pulls
out of the dive (CUE DREAMING MUSIC) flies across the city
EXT PERSHING SQUARE - DAY

Swooping low Barry scatters a flock of pigeons A CRACKHEAD

smoking his pipe sees Barry fly overhead The Crackhead
blinks in disbelief then stares at his crack pipe

CRACKHEAD
Goddamn Never again

He hurls his crack pipe away He waits exactly two seconds
while his forehead starts pouring sweat

CRACKHEAD (CONT)
Ah who the fuck am I kidding

He scrambles to retrieve the pipe As he does two more
CRACKHEADS dive for it Fisticuffs ensue

AERIAL VIEWS - BARRY OVER DOWNTOWN

Barry zooms over Union Station waving to arriving train
passengers waving at the schoolkids lined up at Olvera
Street Everyone waves back merrily as he wheels westward

EXT THE WILTERN THEATER - DAY

Barry zooms over the blue terracotta tower Below him are
some CONCERTGOERS (gorgeous women dressed to the nines)

BARRY
It’s too nice a day to wear black
ladies

Barry waves his hand A RAY OF EFX transforms their clothes
into a rainbow of thong bikinis They react with delight

CONCERTGOERS
Hi Barry We love you
wn

EXT LA BREA TARPITS - DAY

Barry flies over the Page Museum as tourists cheer But
after he passes a large BUBBLE rises up from the Tar Pits
Then another And suddenly a huge PTERODACTYL the size of
a Lear Jet bursts out of the muck with a terrifying SCREECH
It flaps its scaly wings and takes to the air

ANGLE ON BARRY
He looks behind him and does a massive take

BARRY
Oh God no Not again

Barry now starts frantically breaststroking through the sky
trying to pick up speed The Pterodactyl is closing fast

BARRY (CONT)
Go away Leave me alone Shoo

EXT HOLLYWOOD BLVD - DAY

Barry zooms in and out of the buildings along Hollywood Blvd
trying to shake the Pterodactyl He waves his hand at it

BARRY (CONT)
Change Be something else
(Barry points os)
Hey look out it’s Mothra

But the Pterodactyl keeps coming closer and closer snapping
at his heels Barry swoops down into the crowd

EXT GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - DAY

Barry is nowhere to be seen A TOURIST (Minnesota accent)
in a long souvenir T-shirt and straw hat is snapping
pictures of the stars’ footprints with a disposable camera

TOURIST

Geez wouldja lookit dat Dere’s
Marilyn Monroe and Chariton
Heston you betcha

(then bewildered at a

huge slab of wet cement)
And dat must be for Shaquille
ONeal

SPLOSH The Pterodactyl’s giant clawed foot THUDS down in
soupy fresh cement A wave of concrete sloshes away the
“tourist’s” hat revealing Barry He tries to run but the
Pterodactyl sprays him with its white-hot breath drying the
cement instantly immobilizing Barry in a running pose
BARRY (CONT)
No NO This isn’t happening

The Pterodactyl’s jaws grab Barry and snap him free of the
hardened concrete

BARRY (CONT)
(screaming)
This is just a dreeeeeeam

As its jaws close on Barry with a sickening CRUNCH
SMASH CUT TO
INT BEDROOM - MALIBU - DAY

Barry sits bolt upright in bed sweating He looks out the
French doors The beach is empty the sky a perfect blue

BARRY (CONT)
Jesus I was almost eaten alive

VOICE
(a sexy purr)
I’m just getting started

A shape rises up from under the sheets -- it’s KARIN
PRESTON 24 blonde willowy supermodel type

BARRY
Oh Karin thank God

KARIN
Poor Barry Another nightmare
Karin make it all better

She kisses away his cares Then she straddles him and they
start to make love She starts to moan in ecstasy her
moans become screams then her screams become a LOUD
ANNOYING BUZZ Barry covers his ears

BARRY
What are you doing Stop it Shut
up
(he grabs her head in
both hands)
Shut up

SMASH CUT TO
INT BARRY’S OFFICE - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE ENDS)
Barry is leaning back in his chair at his desk He’s

holding a BUZZING radio-clock in his hands -- and suddenly
awake He looks around at his cramped closet of an office
BARRY (CONT)
Oh God The one nightmare I can’t
wake up from

He shuts off the radio ending the BUZZ There’s a KNOCK
NEW ANGLE INCLUDE KARIN

as she pushes open his door her arms full of files She’s
a vision in white silk but her manner is polite distant

KARIN
Excuse me uh
(she glances at the door
nameplate)
-Barry I hate to arouse you
from your little nap

BARRY
No no you didn’t arouse me

Barry rolls his chair back But clearly he is aroused
since he drags open his center desk drawer without using his
hands Karin blinks not quite sure what just happened
Barry quickly rolls back to his desk closing the drawer

KARIN
O-kay Just be aware an alarm
clock at your desk is a dead
giveaway McCone fired the last guy
he caught sleeping at lunchtime

Barry drops the clock radio into his open briefcase

BARRY
Say no more Thanks Karin

Karin turns to go but a few files slip She’s barely got
them by her fingertips

KARIN
Oh Barry be a love and give me a
hand

Barry eagerly rolls back his chairdragging open the
center drawer again Embarrassed he grabs the drawer as
if he’d opened it with his hands Karin stares at him

BARRY
Uh I’d love to but I haveuh
Slow Back Syndrome

KARIN
Slow Back Syndrome
BARRY
Yeah It’1ll be about five minutes
before I can stand up

KARIN
Whatever (turns exasperated)
Lloyd be a darling and

LLOYD 24 Asian rushes to grab the files They move os
Once Karin is gone Barry turns a lever that lowers his
chair with a QUIET HISS Now he’s low enough to clear the
drawer bottom He stands grabs a paperback book to cover
the bulge in his pants and sits back in his chair

MAIA SUAREZ 23 a zaftig funny Latina who dresses in jeans
and oversized sweaters enters and goes right to Barry’s file
cabinet From their informality you know they’ re just buds

MAIA
‘Scuse me just need a file

Maia bends to open the bottom drawer For the first time
he notices she has a butt like Jennifer Lopez

BARRY
under his breath)
Whoa

-- as the paperback leaps off his crotch He catches it in
midair just as Maia turns around He presses it down on his
lap trying to look casual Maia lifts an eyebrow

MATA
You working late again tonight

BARRY
Yeah More taste-testing for the
meeting with Ahab tomorrow

PAN TO coffee urns marked 30 to 53 on his desk He picks
up 39 but his hand shakes so much he has to put it down

MAIA
Youre drinking way too much coffee
I think you’re sleep-deprived

BARRY
What makes that say you
(he sips from a mug)
Ow

MAIA
That was your pencil mug Barry
let me stay and help you
BARRY
No no It could be my chance to
spend time alone with Karin

MAIA
For Karin you have to spend a lot
more than time

BARRY
OK I get it she likes rich guys
But I won’t always be broke

MAIA
(changing the subject)
Good Sowhatcha reading

She sits on his desk and plucks the book off his lap He
rolls under the desk quick We see the cover as Maia reads

MAIA (CONT)
“I Love Lucid Dreaming 100 Steps
To Taking Control of Your Life While
You Sleep” What step are you on

BARRY
Step one I bought the book
(off her look)
Actually I was working on some
of the exercises over lunch

MAIA
Like the screaming exercise I heard
that one all the way from the elevator
(dryly)
Where does the lucid part come in

BARRY
Ever had a dream where you suddenly
realized “Hey this is a dream”

MAIA
Sure Around the time Brad Pitt
crawled to my door on his knees
begging forgiveness it dawned on me

BARRY
That was a lucid dream This book
tells you how to use the awareness
that you’re dreaming to make
anything you want happen next

Barry reaches for the book but Maia keeps hold of it
MAIA
So like I forgive Brad and make him
take me to Hawaii The problem is
when I wake up he’s still married

BARRY
Maia with lucid dreaming you
could have Brad Pitt every night

MAIA
You are seriously creeping me out

BARRY
Or have a different star each time
Or do anything you want

MAIA
You really need a hobby Didn’t you
tell me you used to rollerblade

BARRY
(rolls his eyes)
When I was like 15

MAIA
OK But you’re in the company
karate class

BARRY
Where my only hope is to get a
black belt in bowing

MATA
So what are you saying that your
dreams are better than your life

BARRY
Duh McCone can’t shoot down my
ideas I’m successful rich Karin
loves meand I can fly
(as she turns away
biting her lip)
What’s so funny

MAIA
You flying You’re terrified of
heights You asked for an office
with no windows

As Maia points PAN TO the chart that blocks his window

BARRY
I’m not that bad

Maia whips out a postcard from her sweater pocket

MAIA
Did I show you the card Mom sent me
from the Grand Canyon

BARRY’S POV OF THE POSTCARD - a steep downward view
EERIE ORGAN STING Just like in Vertigo the canyon floor
zooms deeper as he stares at it

BARRY - shuts his eyes grabs the desk for support

BARRY
I’m OK Just a little dizzy spell

MATA
(trying not to laugh)
I’m sorry that was a dirty trick

BARRY
Damn right

MAIA
Barry wake up and smell the
coffee You don’t need to fly You
just need to stand up to McCone

BARRY
You’re confusing fantasy with real
life where I can get fired

MAIA
You know for a smart guy you miss
a lot Your e-Coff-e idea is great
Pitch it to some other company

BARRY
Get real Maia It took me a long
time to get in the door here

MAIA
Barry if you want something to
happen then believe it will and be
ready ’cause I think everybody
gets one lucky day where all the
pieces fall into place

BARRY
OK You believe in fate or
coincidence or whatever Me I
believe in enjoying my dreams

MAIA
If they’re so enjoyable why were
you screaming

BARRY
(sighs)
Well every time I try flying this
damn pterodactyl shows up and eats
me alive Then I wake up

MAIA
See You can’t control your dreams

BARRY
But I do Before I flew I dreamed
about the meeting tomorrow I took
charge I kicked McCone’s ass It
was perfectand it felt just like
real life And the book says once
you dream it you can do it

MAIA
Unless you get so into dreaming you
start to think that’s reality

BARRY
No I always know it’s a dream I
only messed up by trying to fly
The book says you should choose a
level of reality and stick with it
The great thing is when the
pterodactyl caught me I didn’t
wake up -- I took control and
shifted to an even better dream

MAIA
About what

BARRY
Welltake your dream about Brad
Pitt and substitute Karin

A dreamy smile comes over Barry as he recalls it He rolls
back in his chair dragging the center drawer open again

MAIA
Karin You are so typical

BARRY
Why are so down on Karin

MAIA
‘Cause it all came so easy to her

BARRY
You think it was easy for her
growing up with a body like that

MAIA
You mean like she blossomed early
with boobs so big she wore nothing
but baggy clothes to get through 7th
grade without being harassed

BARRY
That’s what I mean Poor Karin

MAIA
I’m talking about my older sister
Karin got her boobs for her 18th

birthday

BARRY
Oh (beat) Is your sister seeing
anyone

She tosses his book back -- it hits him in the diaphragm

MAIA
I have work to do Don’t get up

Maia marches out Barry is wondering what the hell that was
about when McCone leans in

McCONE
My office Now

BARRY
(glances at his lap)
OK be there in a sec

McCONE
Not a sec now Move your ass

McCone exits Barry rises and follows bent over and
holding his book over his crotch

ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
While McCone walks on Barry crosses into another office
INT AUDIO-VIDEO ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

A dimly-lit warren of shelves and equipment with cables
running everywhere Barry peers into the gloom

BARRY
Sam You in here

Suddenly SAM RIVERS 45 steps out of the shadows right in
front of Barry He’s overweight shaves his head and wears
mirrored shades indoors Barry clutches his pounding heart

BARRY (CONT)
Jesus Don’t sneak up like that

SAM
I was standing right here But I
train my eyes to see in the dark
while you choose to be a victim

BARRY
Ri-ight Look can I see that Dr
Laura tape of yours

SAM
The brave little lady takes on the
barbarians eating away at our
culture Damn Barry maybe
there’s hope for you yet

Sam pulls a cassette from a rack and slaps it in a VCR
It’s Dr Laura Schlesinger “helping” a caller

DR LAURA (ON TV)
Listen jerk You made a choice to
have sex with a stranger So you got
a disease and your genitals fell off
Boo-hoo Take it like a man Next
caller

SAM
(admiringly)
She’s like a breath of fresh air

Barry straightens up and smoothes out his pants

BARRY
Or a cold shower
(off Sam’s look)
A refreshing cold shower

SAM

But people put her down Too bad
the liberal press and the bleeding
heart courts and the jack-booted
feds and the traitorous Congress
and the Ivy League commies and the
Hollywood homos and the Jew
bankers

(he pauses lost)
Damn I was leading up to something

BARRY
That you think Dr Laura’s pretty

SAM
God yeah I wrote her a hundred
letters But she’s awful busy
(opens a drawer)
Speaking of pretty take a look at
this beauty

Sam hands something to Barry Barry almost drops it when he
realizes it’s a pistol

BARRY
Holy God Sam you can’t have a
gun in here

SAM
The Second Amendment says I can

BARRY
McCone doesn’t believe in the First
Amendment And you know how paranoid
he is about workplace violence

SAM
(an odd tone)
Oh he’s not paranoid I really do
hate his guts

Barry casts an eye around Sam’s office Sam has framed
pictures of guns and taped-up newsphotos of politicians
starsand McConewith targets drawn on their foreheads

BARRY
I’m starting to understand why he
put in a metal detector downstairs

SAM
Don’t worry I’m not crazy
(then manic)
See this baby’s all ceramic I can
take it on a plane if I want

Behind Barry the door opens -- it’s McCone

BARRY
Sam if McCone knew about this

BARRYS POV - in Sam’s mirrored shades he suddenly sees
McCone’s reflection behind him Barry thinks fast

BARRY (CONT)
--it’d ruin his surprise party
INSERT - BARRY’S POCKET
Barry shoves the pistol into his pants pocket
BACK TO SHOT as Barry now turns and feigns surprise

BARRY (CONT)
Gee Clark you didn’t hear what we
were saying just then did you

McCONE
A you know goddamn well I don’t
allow office parties B my birthday
is six months away and C the only
surprise would be if either of you
turd-polishers still has a job then

SAM
What’s that supposed to mean boss

McCONE
It means that tape you dubbed for
Maia had a little featurette at the
end starring you in your militia
fatigues on a hunting trip

SAM
(to himself vexed)
Damn I breached security

McCONE
Don’t ever take company tapes for
your own use What in hell were you
hunting anyway What’s “long pig”

SAM
Someday I’11 take you hunting and
you can find out

BARRY
I’1ll just be going

McCONE
I’m not done with you yet

Barry leans against the door to hide the bulge of the gun

SAM
My last boss came to regret firing me

McCONE
(scornful)
Maybe we should call him and ask if
he’d like you back wherever that was

SAM
(darkly)
The post office But he’s not
there anymore No one is

A vein in Sam’s temple starts to throb Barry gulps and
Slips out McCone still doesn’t get the message He plucks
Sam’s mirrored shades away

McCONE
Take those off when you talk to me
Why do you keep it so dark in here

McCone flicks the fluorescent lights ON

SAM
(covers his eyes)
Arrgghh

Now McCone sees the newsphotos and framed pictures of guns
It finally dawns on him Sam might be a bit unbalanced He
flicks the lights OFF

McCONE
Uh naturally I don’t make these
decisions I’1l try to square things
for you with Personnel Here

McCone hands Sam back his shades Sam just glowers at him
as McCone backs out of the room

INT BARRY’S OFFICE - DAY

Barry enters the gun barrel bulging lewdly in his pants
He starts to remove it but McCone enters Barry hurries to
sit behind his desk as McCone shuts the door

BARRY
W-what can I do for you Clark

McCONE
I’ve decided it’s time I delegated
more authority to you

BARRY
Great What do I do first

McCONE
Fire Sam Rivers

BARRY
(leaps up)
What

McCONE
(off Barry’s bulging pants)
Whoa easy tiger I misjudged you
(leans close confiding)
You’ re not the only one who gets a
woody from firing people

BARRY
B-but that’s not my job

McCONE
It is now I’m making you VP of
Personnel

BARRY
Do I get a raise Or at least a
big insurance policy

McCONE
No but I tell you whatif Sam’s
ass isn’t out of here in half an
hour yours will be

INT CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)
Maia pauses by Barry’s door eavesdropping

BARRY (OS MUFFLED)
Wait a minute If I do this then
you have to let me pitch e-Coff-e
to Mr Ahab tomorrow

Maia silently mouths “Yesss” to herself

McCONE (OS MUFFLED)
Godammit we’re discussing a celebrity
endorsement period You even show your
face in that meeting and you’ll be so
close behind Sam in the unemployment
line they’1ll think you’re a couple Log
Cabin Republicans Got me

Maia waits tensely hoping Barry will stand firm

BARRY (OS MUFFLED)
(at last resigned)
Yeah yeah I got you

Maia slumps disappointed and moves off Now KATY McCONE
10 cute but spoiled comes up to Barry’s door

McCONE (0S MUFFLED)
Good If I ever hear the word “e-
Coff-e” again you will be so fu--

Katy enters McCone instantly cleans up his language

McCONE (CONT)
--funny that the everyone will be
laughing at you
(to Katy)
Hi sugarbear You found Daddy

KATY
You promised I could watch someone
get fired This blows I wish I
was back at camp

McCONE
Daddy’1l fire someone for you
tomorrow
(to Barry pointedly)
Or maybe in a few minutes

McCone walks Katy out
INT AUDIO-VIDEO ROOM - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Barry TAPS timidly on the door and enters Sam stands there
swigging Ripple wine staring glumly at his photos

BARRY
Sam How’s it going

Barry sneaks a look into Sam’s open desk drawer Nothing

SAM
What do you want

BARRY
You know what I think this place
is getting you down

SAM
Tell me about it

BARRY
(frisking Sam’s coat on
the door hook)
What you need is a change Take
some time off Read Travel
Maybe start stalking Dr Laura

SAM
I can’t take time off I’m one
paycheck from living on the street

BARRY
Yeah Me too

Barry throws a sympathetic arm around Sam’s shoulder uses
it to pat down his shirt then runs it down to Sam’s waist

BARRY (CONT)
But the government has a neat
program thatll help you buy
groceries while you’re on
sabbatical

Sam stiffens and pushes Barry’s arm away

SAM
I don’t want any damn food stamps
Sabbatical my ass -- you came here

to fire me

BARRY
Fire you Oh no no no no
(as Sam backs him into a
corner)
well maybe H-how would you
feel about that

SAM
It’s not your decision I don’t
hold it against you

BARRY
(jubilant)
Really That’s great I’m so --
(catches himself)
-- so bummed about this Want help
cleaning out your desk

SAM

I’d like to be alone
BARRY

You got it

Barry is almost out the door when Sam speaks

SAM
Barrymy gun

BARRY
(turns hands it to him)
Right Forgot I had it
Barry turns to gountil he hears Sam eject the magazine

SAM
Barrywhere are my bullets

BARRY
Oh I meant to tell you I was in
the restroom and I accidentally
dropped them in the toilet And
then I accidentally flushed them
About six times

SAM
(mildly)
Thanks for being honest

INT CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)

Barry exits Sam’s room glancing nervously behind him He
passes a WORKMAN on a stepladder replacing a fluorescent
tube Barry brushes the tube which falls on the bottom
step and explodes with a POP Barry jumps a foot

BARRY
Jesus

Barry feels himself realizes he wasn’t shot Then he looks
down at his pants dismayed and runs into the men’s room

INT MEN’S ROOM - DAY (TEN MINUTES LATER)

Barry is rinsing out his shorts in the sink He wrings them
out then pulls his suit pants off the WHIRRING hand dryer
hooks his shorts on its nozzle and presses the button

INT ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Barry emerges from the men’s room pants dry again McCone
Maia and Karin are watching SECURITY escort Sam and his box
of personal effects to the elevator Sam hands Barry his
open wine bottle

SAM
Finish this for me Barry

BARRY
Th-thanks

SAM
McCone I’1l see you in hell

BARRY
(sotto to Maia)
I thought he wasn’t coming in
tomorrow

As the elevator closes Sam glowers the vein in his temple
throbbing The Workman drops another fluorescent tube --
BANG Barry jumps again --

BARRY
Gaaaaaaah

KARIN (OS)
Auuuugghh

WIDEN TO SHOW Barry splashed red wine on Karin’s white silk
outfit If looks could kill she’d have him in Forest Lawn

INT EMPTY OFFICE - DAY (AFTER 5 PM)

An unused carpeted office (with the Ahab’s logo on the
wall) is where Barry Lloyd and a few other COWORKERS with
black or brown belts are lined up in karate robes Barry is
the only one in class with white belt They bow to their
sensei HAROLD 51 a gray-haired black man of much gravitas

HAROLD
All right Everyone pair up with
someone at your level We’1ll work
on self-defense moves

Everyone pairs up immediately leaving Barry odd man out
Harold takes Barry aside puts an arm around his shoulder

BARRY
I’d do better in this class if I had
another novice to practice with

HAROLD
Everyone in this class was once a
beginner just like you

BARRY
Yeah but how many have been a
beginner for four years

HAROLD
Karate is not about the time you
put in Barry It’s about your
mind You got to have confidence

There’s a KNOCK Harold goes to the door McCone puts his
head in and they exchange a few inaudible words

HAROLD (CONT)
Barry I found you a partner who
should be on your level

Barry brightensuntil the door opens and Katy walks in
BARRY

Thanks Harold This does wonders
for my confidence

HAROLD
Pretend you’re mugging her

Barry and Katy bow to each other Barry grabs her shoulders

KATY
Don’t be too rough OK

BARRY

you stay at camp riding ponies and
stitching wallets

KATY

Karin’s desk guards the entrance to McCone’s office Karin
(in a stunning burgundy outfit) stops Maia as she passes by

KARIN
Maia you think Mr Ahab will like
this dress on me

MAIA
Probably like it better off you

KARIN
It wouldn’t kill you to wear
something a little more flattering
You always look like you’re peeking
out of a pup tent

MAIA
(ignores that)
Karin Ahab’s been married four
times Would you even give hima
second thought if he wasn’t rich

KARIN
(alarmed)
Why What have you heard

MAIA
Nothing

KARIN
Don’t scare me like that Hey
o™ listen for my phone a sec

MAIA
Sure

Karin goes into the adjacent coffee room With a DING the
elevator opens Barry skates out and starts circling Maia

BARRY
Hi Maia

MAIA
Uh we havent had casual Fridays
here since like ever

BARRY
(still circling)
I know I got so sick of that suit
and tie that I threw ’em away

MAIA
And paid good money for that getup

BARRY
(chuckles realizing)
Actually I forgot to pay No
wonder the owner was yelling

MAIA
Barry did you get any sleep at all
last night Are you having some
kind of breakdown
(she grabs hold of him)
Stop it I’m gonna hurl

She glances around then pulls him in her office

INT MAIA’S OFFICE - DAY

Maia closes the door as Barry skates over to her desk and
looks in her coffee cup

BARRY
Water Ah-ah-ah You’re not
drinking Ahab’s coffee

MAIA
Of course not That stuff is
battery acid Have you forgotten
today is the big meeting with Ahab
BARRY
I know And when I wake up in the
morning I’1l know just what to do
in the real one

MAIA
The real one When you wake up
Oh my GodBarry do you think
this is a dream

BARRY
Of course it is

MAIA
(gasps)
You’re not going to fly are you

BARRY
Would you like me to

MAIA
No Barry listen carefully to me
You are not dreaming You are
awake This is real

BARRY
Don’t be ridiculous Don’t you
think I can tell the difference
between a dream and reality

MAIA
Not anymore
(sinks into her chair
head in hands)
Ohhh I knew it That stupid lucid
dreaming made you flip out

BARRY
You know how I knew
(he pulls out three 100

bills)
The first thing I did was stick my
hand in my pocket - and out came

600 I sure as hell haven’t had
600 in one hand since I started
working here

MAIA
Somebody must have given them to
you and you forgot

BARRY

(sarcastic)
Right And when I went outside and
my whole block was changed why was
that Hey maybe they were
shooting a movie And no one told
me But why would they give me a
latte and a Ferrari to drive Oh I
got it They thought I was a famous
star But how did I turn Penny’s cat
poop into a candy bar

MAIA
There must be some explanation
And by the way you only have 300

BARRY

I threw the other 300 away
MAIA

What
BARRY

I had to do something to get the
cops off my tail

MAIA
The cops

BARRY
It was either that or fly away I
mean I was doing 90 down Sunset

MAIA
Oh my God oh my God

BARRY
I came off the freeway on two
wheels and flipped the Ferrari --
Penny and I walked away without a
scratch How likely is that in
real life How could I walk through
a shower room full of beautiful
women without anyone seeing me

MAIA
You did what

BARRY
Oh wait I knowthey were all
blind Does that sound remotely
possible Maia That many
coincidences in a row

MAIA
(stunned)
Why did you walk through the shower
room

BARRY
I’m a guy That’s the kind of
stuff we dream about

Fuming Maia reaches for her cup of water

MAIA
It might turn out to be a wet
dream

BARRY

I know that’s why I stopped
Because I want to do this meeting
right Confident like I feel right
now Once I dream itI can do it

She was about to dash water in his face but something in
his manner impresses her

BARRY (CONT)
(chucks her chin fondly)
Maia you’re the only person in the
world I would spend time explaining
things to when you’re a character in
my dream But I gotta do that
meeting before my alarm goes off

MAIA
(checks her watch her
mind racing)
YeahI figure you have fifteen
minutes to make the pitch of your
life Because you’re gonna need a
lot of money for lawyers

BARRY
What do you mean

MAIA

(jumps up resolved)
Barry there’s only one explanation
for all these coincidencesthis
is your day So you’re gonna go
into that meeting and take charge
Youre going sell Mr Ahab on
e-Coff-e But I want your solemn
word -- no flying no magic and no
violence of any kind Promise

BARRY
OK This is so strange though
Youre a character in my dream who
knows Im dreamingand gives me
advice about it Only you Maia

MAIA
WellI’m just flattered that
you’re dreaming about me Now go
get your e-Coff-e materials

BARRY
Right --

Barry starts to turn around but his rollerblade catches on
her computer cord and he stumbles back falling into her
chair and banging his elbow on the corner of her desk

BARRY (CONT)
Ow Dang I hit my funnybone
(then a chilling thought)
Wait a secondI’ve never heard of
anyone getting hurt in a dream

MAIA
(quickly)
Sure they do Happens to me all
the time
BARRY

It’s never happened to me

Barry just sits at the desk confused Maia climbs on her
desk kneels in front of him and grabs him by his shoulders

MAIA

Barry is there something that
could happen right now that would
prove this is a dream

(before he can say it)
Not flying But something that
would never happen in a million
years in reality

Maia looks at him searching his eyes She leans closer

BARRY
Maybe It’s funnyI don’t remember
you in my dreams about the office
There is a dynamite brunette whose
face I can never see but --

Maia grabs him and gives him the longest steamiest kiss we
can have in a PG-13 movie Finally she lets him up for air

MAIA
Now would I have done that in real
life
BARRY
(a squawk)
No

Maia hops off the desk and rolls him back in his chair
this time opening her center drawer

BARRY (CONT)
Wait let’s do some more of that

MAIA
Picture Dr Laura in black leather

He looks at his lap dismayed She can now close her drawer

BARRY
Awwwwhy’d you do that
MAIA
This isn’t gonna be that kind of dream
BARRY
Why not
MAIA

(pulls him to his feet)
Cause you just washed your sheets

minutes waiting for coffee six for
espresso and eight for a latte

Skating backwards one of Barry’s skates goes off the edge
but Barry smoothly transitions to land on his other foot
Ahab and the rest GASP in horror

BARRY (CONT)
I know it’s startling Think of
the wasted productivity Now would
you believe me if I said Ahab’s
could cut that wait to under a
minute per customer

Barry’s first card blows out of his hand He reaches
trying to get it and nearly overbalances

AHAB
Nooooo

Unconcerned Barry grabs a cornice stone to steady himself

BARRY
Of course you don’t But that’s
because you haven’t heard my e-
Coff-e plan

Barry holds up a card with “e-Coff-e” and bullet points
underneath The WIND GROWS LOUDER and the card catches it
like a sail He’s so busy putting a finger on each bullet
point that he doesn’t notice that he’s rolling backward
towards the corner of the building Everyones freaking
but Barry ignores their screams

FIRES showering Sam with shredded bagels

HESTON

youre using a Ruger MkII I hate
to think how much that subsonic
ammo is costing you

Heston pops out his magazine and slaps in a new one

SAM
Naah I use regular ammo The RSB
silencer has a ported barrel that
reduces it to subsonic
(shoots out a light near
Heston)
See Quieter than a pellet gun

Instead Penny sits on Sam’s shoulder and plays with the
leather tether of Sam’s sunglasses

BARRY (CONT)
Oh you stupid cat

But it gives him an idea With his last strength Barry
reaches up and yanks Sam’s sunglasses off Sam throws an
arm over his eyes like Dracula greeting the dawn

SAM
Arrrrrrrrggggggghhhh

Penny leaps off Sam and onto the ledge She looks bored
Then COPTER MOTORS grow louder overhead Barry looks up

BARRY’S POV - SWAT HELICOPTER

Barry can see the copter battling the winds trying to land
on the building and what looks like a rope ladder hanging

from under it It’s dangling over the building edge beside
the disabled window washer platform

ANGLE ON BARRY
As he leaps up waving his arms to the copter

BARRY
Maia we’re saved

HIGH ANGLE FROM ROOF

The rope ladder alas is not tied to anything it’s just
being blown over the edge by the backwash of the helicopter

ANGLE ON BARRY

Barry reaches outhe’s just inches from the ladderhe
grabs it At that moment Sam groping blindly grabs him
Barry is torn between death on the platform and death on the
rope ladder At last he breaks free of Sam and leaps onto
the ladder He promptly falls another 20 feet until the
end of the falling rope ladder snags on the platform

Sam squinting against the daylight reaches down and feels
the tension on the rope ladder -- he realizes where Barry
is He pulls a huge knife from a scabbard in his boot and
starts sawing on the rope

BARRY
Aaaaa

Barry starts climbing back up as fast as he can

ANGLE ON HESTON AT WINDOW

He’s pressing his 44 Magnum on the window ledge of the
building trying to loosen it

HESTON
Cmon c’mon

Maia frantically edges back to the window

MAIA
Mr Heston the coffee urn

Heston grabs the urn and tosses it to Maia She turns to
Barry below her

MAIA
Barry catch

BARRY ON ROPE LADDER

Barry catches the urn He’s four feet below Sam but he
can’t get any closer because of the knife Sam has almost
cut the rope clean through Barry tears off the lid of the
urn and hurls the coffee into Sam’s face Sam reacts
startled then starts to laugh

SAM
Hahahaha You loser That
coffee’s cold
(he laughs morethen
squints one eye in pain)
But oh my God it’s like battery
acid My eye Aaaaauuugggh

Sam drops the knife and puts his hand to his eye Then
furious he leans way forward and reaches for a laser-
sighted pistol in his bag Barry pushes the bag strap off
the bolt Sam tries to grab it overbalances and falls
BARRY’S POV ON SAM

Sam and his weapons fall toward the just-deployed airbag on
the plaza below Sam grips the laser-sighted pistol With
his one good eye as he falls he takes aim at Barry

ANGLE ON BARRY

as the RED LASER DOT moves up Barry’s body toward his head
ANGLE ON HESTON

Frustrated Heston bangs his 44 on the stone side of the
building

HESTON
Damn you damn you

ANGLE ON SAM - SLOW MOTION

as he nears the airbag steadying his gun ready to fire
ANGLE ON BARRY - SLOW MOTION

as the RED LASER SIGHT reaches the bridge of his nose

ON HESTON

One last blow on the stone and his 44 DISCHARGES downward
SLOW MOTION SHOT

of the bullet hitting the airbag just before Sam does

EXT SECOND STREET BLDG - GROUND FLOOR (CONTINUOUS)

The bag deflates dramatically The crowd gapes

CROWD
(a sympathetic moan)

WIPE TO
INT AHAB OFFICE LOBBY - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
The Captain is there with Barry and Maia

CAPTAIN

You are going to need a good
lawyer Mr Murphy But given what
you did out there and everything
Ms Suarez told us I expect the
DA will drop all charges
Especially since no one was killed

(then into com-line)
Or was he

EXT SECOND STREET BLDG - GROUND FLOOR (CONTINUOUS)
Paramedics work on Sam lying on the deflated air bag
PARAMEDIC

This man has literally broken every
bone in his body except one

EXT BUILDING - 10TH FLOOR - DAY

Penny jumps in Dr Parkins’ broken window brushing the
abandoned coffee urn as she goes It falls off

EXT SECOND STREET BLDG - GROUND FLOOR (CONTINUOUS)

INT AHAB’S OFFICE LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)
Barry notices Maia slipping away into the crowd

BARRY
Excuse me

Barry hurries after Maia

BARRY
Maia wait

Maia turns Barry can’t help but stare at her chest again

MATA
(impatient)
Yes they’re real I’m real It’s
not a dream

BARRY
So the story about your sister

MAIA
I don’t have a sister That was
me I never told you becauseI
wanted you in love with me Not
with these Now it’s too late
BARRY
I didn’t know you had those But I
did realize you’re the girl I see
in my dreams And I knew I couldn’t
live without you You said yourself
heights scare the crap out of me
Only one thing could’ve gotten me
out there after youI love you

MAIA
(she wants to believe)
And you did that knowing it wasn’t
a dream

BARRY
If you don’t believe me check my
underwear

Heston winces at that line but with tears of joy Maia
throws her arms around Barry and they kiss

KARIN
(wistful)
That’s what I call romance

HESTON
(dismayed)
Do you I was thinking of
directing Romeo and Juliet next
year Maybe it’s a lost cause

The Captain throws an arm around Heston takes him aside

CAPTAIN
Mr Heston I’d see anything you
did Planet of the Apes was
brilliant I don’t just mean it
had great lines or made a lot of
money It was about something

HESTON
(relieved)
Thank you You’re the third person
today who’s praised the film but
the first who really understood its
importance

CAPTAIN
That last scene was such a stunner
(Heston nods flattered)
I mean this planet full of monkeys
builds a statue of liberty that looks
just like ours What are the odds

Heston sighs and starts looking for an escape route
ANGLE ON McCONE AND AHAB

Barry and Maia walk arm and arm over to where an EMT is
splinting McCone’s fingers and another is bandaging his
butt Two Cops lead a struggling Katy off in handcuffs

KATY
Lemme go you lousy pigs I didn’t
do anything

McCONE

EXT TROPICAL RESORT - DAY (ONE YEAR LATER) (DREAM)

up from the shore as Barry lies sunbathing on a beach towel
beside the incredible bronzed body of Karin She sits up
yawns and stretches

KARIN
Barry darling I know you gave me
a thousand this morning But I
need another thousand

Barry bolt upright in a panic

able to wake up immediately

Maia leans over the counter from above She’s sweating too

MAIA
