Winter’s Discontent
By

Paul Fruchbom
FADE IN

EXT SHADY PINES CEMETERY - DAY

Light rain falls on a small group of mourners gathered around
a simple metal casket A MINISTER reads from the Book of
Common Prayer Something about dust

HERB WINTER 75 stands at the front of the crowd His suit
is black His hair is white And his eyes colored with
melancholy But not because he’s at a funeral

HERB (VO)

My name is Herb Winter Today is
my seventy-fifth birthday And
just so we’re clear this is not
what I wished for

Next to the casket is a picture of the deceased a woman in
her mid-70s In the photo the woman is smiling but it
looks awkward forced as if she doesn’t really know how

HERB (VO)
This is my wife Ellen

(looks back at the casket)
Well at least she used to be my
wife

The tombstone reads “Ellen Lassiter 1933 - 2008”

HERB (VO)
Ellen never took my last name It
was quite uncommon back then but I
didn’t really mind She had always
been a liberated woman
(beat)
Except in the bedroom

The minister continues his prayer

HERB (VO)
I can’t remember the last time we
had sex And that’s not because my
memory’s gone to hell Even when
we were younger Ellen was never
that adventurous Id be pumping
away and she would just lie there
motionless like she was de--

(he catches himself)

Well you know what I mean Let’s
just say that seeing Ellen lying on
her back without a pulse is not
an entirely new experience for me
The minister finishes speaking He motions to two grave-
diggers who slowly lower the casket into the ground

One mourner CHERYL SOLOMON a slender woman in her late 40s
begins to weep Herb’s eyes wander to her breasts

HERB (VO)
You probably think I’m not a very
nice person But you know what I
don’t give a shit what you think

As Herb continues his inner monologue the other mourners
disperse But Herb stays behind watching his wife’s grave
fill with dirt
HERB (VO)

I’ve been a faithful husband for

more than fifty years I’ve earned

the right to be selfish And now

I’m ready to nail some fresh ass
until slowly almost imperceptibly he starts to smile
And just as “Eleanor Rigby” by The Beatles kicks in we

--BEGIN MAIN TITLES

EXT SHADY PINES CEMETERY - LATER

The rain continues to fall A small procession of cheap
American compact cars winds its way through the cemetery
INT HERB’S CAR - DAY

Herb drives an old Ford Escort He squints to see the road
ahead a combination of poor eyesight and poor visibility
EXT STREET - DAY

The procession winds its way through a leafy suburban
street It looks like Connecticut Well-appointed two-
story homes Manicured lawns Driveways filled with foreign
cars and basketball hoops Actually it is Connecticut
EXT HERB’S HOUSE - DAY

Then the cars arrive at Herb’s house peeling paint an

overgrown lawn shuttered windows The one house children
avoid on Halloween Or any other day for that matter
Cheryl’s smiling face peers out from a “For Sale” sign posted
in the front yard A red “Sold” sticker is attached

INT HERB’S HOUSE - DAY

The wake is in full swing Mourners talk quietly amongst
themselves eating potato salad

A family picture of Herb and Ellen dominates the living room
Herb is stone-faced Ellen forces a painful smile It’s the
exact same image of her seen at the funeral

Other photos show Herb as a young man in an army uniform
Herb and Ellen getting married Herb and Ellen in front of
their new home They wear the same awkward expressions in
every shot

The rest of the living room is as drab as the photos floral
print wallpaper doilies a dusty piano in the corner

And then there’s Herb sitting by himself in a La-Z-Boy
drinking a martini on the rocks

SUPER “WINTERS DISCONTENT”
Herb takes a long sip from his drink

HERB (VO)
God I hate this fucking house
Look at that wallpaper Ellen
loved that wallpaper She must
have been retarded

A MOURNER approaches He takes Herb’s hand

MOURNER 1
I’m so sorry for your loss

Herb follows the routine He smiles meekly He nods his
head He looks solemn The mourner leaves

HERB (VO)
Loss If you want to talk about
loss let’s talk about that piano
It hasn’t been touched in thirty
years It has a lot in common with
my balls

Another mourner approaches

MOURNER 2
I’m so sorry for your loss
Herb feigns gratitude yet again The mourner leaves

HERB (VO)
Who the fuck are these people

JULES ROSENBAUM mid-70s sits next to Herb He is basically
the nicest guy you could ever meet A Jewish Mister Rogers

JULES
She was a special woman wasn’t
she Just extraordinary

HERB (VO)
Jules is my best friend But he’s
also an idiot

JULES
We’ve had some good times here
haven’t we

Herb looks at Jules His eyes say it all ‘No we havent’

JULES
You and Ellen Me and Florence
Remember that time--

HERB
Enough about Ellen okay

Herb takes a sip of his drink It helps to lighten his mood

HERB
Let’s talk about something else
Spruce Gardens Is it as good as I
hear

JULES

You want to discuss this now

HERB
Four to one That’s the ratio I’ve
heard Four-to-one women to men

JULES
I guess that’s right If you count
the Alzheimer’s patients

HERB
I’m counting everyone with two X
chromosomes and a functioning
spinal column

Cheryl approaches from Herb’s blind side
HERB
(to Jules)
So have you gotten your cock
sucked yet

-and pretends she didn’t hear that When Herb finally
notices her he goes back to fake-mourning mode

HERB
Oh Cheryl Thank you so much for
coming It means a lot

Cheryl leans over to take Herb’s hand It’s very difficult
for Herb not to stare at her cleavage Very difficult

CHERYL
Of course If there’s anything I
can do just let me know

HERB (VO)
I can think of so many things

HERB
That’s so kind of you

CHERYL
(re the house)
It’s hard to believe that in a few
weeks this will all be gone

HERB
Jules and I were just talking about
all the great times we’ve had here

CHERYL
Well you timed the market
perfectly

HERB
I guess I’ve just been lucky
lately

Cheryl looks confused Herb realizes he said that aloud

HERB
I’m sorry That’s something Ellen
used to say She had these little
catchphrases

HERB (VO)
Like ‘Get that dirty thing out of
my face’
HERB
and I’ve been using them lately
trying to keep her spirit alive

Cheryl nods smiling Herb can be a convincing liar

CHERYL
Well good luck at Spruce Gardens

As Cheryl walks away Herb’s eyes linger on her
Bouncy Hypnotic Then he turns to Jules

HERB
So back to your cock

JULES
I don’t want to talk about it
Herb

HERB

Just tell me A little lick

JULES
I don’t want to talk about it
Especially not here Not now
(beat calmer)
Besides I don’t really play the
field

HERB
But you know what the field looks
like right You can provide say
a road map

JULES
I don’t know maybe What exactly
do you want

HERB
What do you think
(beat)
But for now all I really want is a
list The women who give the best
blow jobs at Spruce Gardens In
descending order

Herb downs the rest of his drink in one gulp

HERB
And another martini
(sensing reluctance)
Come on Julie It’s my birthday

ass

Tight
JULES
I know I’m the only one who ever
remembers

Jules gets up and Herb turns his attention back to the wake
His eyes wander once again to Cheryl’s breasts

A great view

A fresh martini

A dead wife

As “Paradise City” by Guns ‘N Roses kicks in Herb leans back
in his chair and tries very hard not to look so happy

EXT SPRUCE GARDENS - DAY

A wooden sign reads “Spruce Gardens For Active Seniors”
It sits on the front lawn of an upscale retirement village

As the MUSIC continues we catch glimpses of

--The tennis courts Four women dressed in visors and short
skirts play a game of doubles

--The swimming pool A group of residents take part in
“water aerobics” The class is all female

--The lawn-bowling field A game is in progress White
hair White clothes And men are few and far between

INT SPRUCE GARDENS - DAY
A woman’s shapely ass fills the screen

KATE (0S)

To the left is our music room
There are acappella concerts every
Friday and music appreciation
seminars twice a month

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Herb staring at that ass Its owner is KATE BENTLEY late
50s a natural beauty with a nice smile and an even nicer

ass

KATE
Do you play any instruments
HERB
I used to play the piano But that
was a long time ago

KATE
Well the one we have is very nice
(moving on)
Over here on the right is our gym
Cardio machines free weights et
cetera Do you work out

HERB
No Not since I served in Korea

KATE
You were in the war

Herb nods

KATE
So was my dad

Herb stops nodding That stings

KATE
If you’re anything like him
there’s probably a lot of things
you don’t do anymore

That stings even more And Kate can tell

KATE
I’m sorry That came out wrong

HERB
No no it’s okay Youre very
perceptive I’m actually hoping
Spruce Gardens will get me back in
the swing of a lot of things

Just then WANDA NEWTON walks by Skinny mid-70s
mischievous She eye-fucks Herb for a good two seconds

KATE
That’s Wanda

HERB
Wanda huh

KATE
She’s very friendly If that’s
your type
HERB
I don’t really have a type I’m
more of an equal opportunity
employer

Kate smiles politely They continue walking

KATE
So Mr Winter--

HERB
Please

Herb looks at Kate’s name tag which rests just on top of her
breasts He loses his train of thought for a moment

HERB
Kate It’s Kate right
(off her nod)
Call me Herb

KATE
Okay Herb What did you do
before you came here

HERB
I was a salesman

KATE
Oh So you’re a people person

HERB
I wasn’t a very good salesman

KATE
(brushing that off)
And what did you sell

HERB
Typewriters

KATE
Typewriters

HERB
Typewriters

KATE
I guess that makes sense

HERB
I know We’re both obsolete

KATE
No that’s not what I meant
Playing the piano Typing You
must be very good with your hands

Herb has a brief coughing fit Kate continues the tour

KATE
We’re coming up on our cafeteria
and dining hall Each night in
addition to our regular menu we
have a vegetarian option a low-
salt option and a no-fat option

HERB
Sounds like--

KATE
Your wife’s cooking

Herb smiles That’s exactly what he was going to say

KATE
I get that a lot

HERB
Actually my wife didn’t cook much
We ate a lot of canned soup

KATE
I’m very sorry to hear about your
loss

HERB

Well you win some you lose some

Kate looks confused Herb realizes he said that aloud
Again He fumbles for a lie

HERB
I’m sorry That’s uh my
wife she had these sayings

KATE
It’s okay I understand

And Herb can tell that she really does He looks at her for
a moment touched But it’s only a moment He turns away
almost embarrassed to be the object of her compassion

KATE
Here let me show you our bocce
courts

INT SPRUCE GARDENS CAFETERIA - NIGHT

An upscale cafeteria with a salad bar a grill station and a
small team of chefs Herb and Jules are eyeing their dinner
options The women are all eyeing Herb Fresh meat

JULES
(to the counter-person)
I’‘1l get the fish of the day
please A half-order of brown
rice And some steamed vegetables

HERB
Your wife’s been dead for three
years Jules Your balls should
have grown back by now

JULES
I’m watching my salt intake

HERB

Salt’s a preservative Your
testicles need all the help they
can get

(to the counter-person)
I’1l have a steak rare Some
corn A double order of mashed
potatoes And could you just ladle
some melted butter over everything

The counter-person nods

JULES
You’re going to kill yourself

HERB
The more fat in your diet the
better your semen tastes

JULES
You’re barbaric

HERB
What I read it in Esquire

JULES
Have you done a taste test

HERB
Fuck you Just tell me where I can
get a drink around here
(looking around the room)
(MORE )

HERB (contd)
Supposedly alcohol makes your
erections last longer

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - NIGHT

Herb sipping on his second martini is in the middle of a
story He’s sitting with Jules ELMER WILLIAMS and CHARLIE
HASSELBACK two long-time residents both in their early 80s

HERB
So on my way back from Korea I
have a few days in Paris And I’m
at a bistro on the Left Bank when
in walks this little Brigitte
Bardot look-alike

ELMER
Were you wearing your uniform

HERB
Of course

CHARLIE
Fuckin’ frogs get so wet for a guy
in uniform

ELMER
I’ve never been with a French girl

CHARLIE
They don’t shave their armpits

ELMER
I thought that was the Italians

Herb interrupts so he can resume his story

HERB
I don’t care if this girl had hair
on her ass She was stunning
Anyway I buy her some drinks and
we start talking She’s speaking
French I’m speaking English and
neither one of us knows what the
other is saying But by the end of
the night I know this girl wants
to take me home

Jules looks concerned

JULES
Did you go

CHARLIE
Of course he did He’s not a
queer

HERB

No I didn’t That’s the crazy
part Ellen and I were supposed to
get married when I got back And
I guess I wanted to be faithful
But I got to tell you it’s one of
the great regrets of my life
(takes a sip of his drink)
Ill never forget the last thing
she said to me either Just as
I’m leaving she pulls me close
presses her breasts up against my
chest and whispers in my ear ‘Je
sucerai ta bite pour deux francs’

ELMER
(wistfully)
Je sucerai ta bite pour deux
francs

JULES
What does that mean

HERB
I didn’t know Like I said I
don’t speak French But I looked
it up a few days later

Herb pauses and looks around the table

HERB
I’11l suck your cock for two francs

Charlie and Elmer erupt with laughter Jules isn’t amused

HERB
It sounds a lot better in French

CHARLIE
It sounds good in any language

HERB

(shifting the topic)
So Charlie Elmer there’s
something else I wanted to talk
about Jules here has given me a
preliminary briefing on the female
talent in this establishment But
it’s a little thin on details

Herb hands over a list of names The list Jules gave him

HERB
I was hoping you might be able to
fill in some of the blanks

Elmer and Charlie scan the list occasionally nodding their
heads approvingly But they also look a little wary

CHARLIE
Herb you seem like a good guy

ELMER
A great guy

CHARLIE
Exactly But it’s just

HERB

I know what you’re getting at But
look around you For the first
time in our lives we’re in a place
where a penis -- any penis -- is a
prized commodity There’s no need
to compete with each other And if
we work together we’1ll all be able
to save a lot of time and energy
for more stimulating endeavors

Elmer and Charlie look at each other tacitly acknowledging
Herb’s point They look back at Herb

ELMER
All right What do you want to
know

In the background Frank Sinatra’s “The Lady is a Tramp”
begins to play on the dining hall’s speakers

INT HERB’S ROOM - NIGHT

Herb is watching TV in his spare undecorated living room
His only furniture is his La-Z-Boy and a bookshelf lined with
classical records and 1940s burlesque films

A KNOCK at the door It’s Eva holding a pastry box
EVA
Hi I just wanted to introduce
myself and say welcome to Spruce
Gardens I’m Eva

HERB
That’s very kind of you I’m Herb

EVA

She’s shy nervous like a teenager She hands him the box

EVA
It’s carrot cake

HERB
I love carrot cake

EVA
I whipped the cream myself

HERB
Oh That’s great I can’t wait
to taste it

EVA
Anytime I’m in room thirty-seven
INT HERB’S ROOM - LATER

Herb continues to watch TV Another KNOCK at the door This
time it’s Iris Shalov carrying homemade toasted almonds

CUT TO

Herb opening the door once again This time it’s Wanda But
she’s not carrying anything

WANDA
Hello Herb

HERB
Let me guess Homemade jam

WANDA

No Those other girls still think
the way to a man’s heart is through
his stomach But I’m not really
interested in a man’s heart if you
know what I mean

(beat)
Mind if I come inside

Herb ushers her in Wanda starts to look around

WANDA
I like what you’ve done with the
place Minimalist

She scans Herb’s movies and pulls out one of the tapes It’s
called “Peeping Tom’s Paradise”

WANDA
This is one of my favorites

HERB
So Wanda--

WANDA
You know my name
(off Herb’s nod)
I’m impressed So far

HERB
Would you like a drink I have
gin And well gin

WANDA

Herbie Can I call you Herbie

Herbie nods Wanda comes closer

WANDA
Do you want to drink Or do you
want to fuck

Herb is speechless A bead of sweat trickles down his cheek
HERB
(nervous )

Is that a rhetorical question

Wanda smiles She’s now an inch away from his face A slow
sexually-charged beat

and then they start kissing like horny teenagers Hands
groping Tongues probing It’s kind of disgusting
WANDA
(breaking the kiss)
Do you have a condom

Herb is breathing heavily His hair is disheveled

HERB
A what
WANDA
(smiling)

Don’t worry
She pulls a condom out of her pocket and hands it to Herb

HERB
Thanks

Herb walks to the bathroom but then stops and turns around

HERB
I’m sorry but do you have any
extras

WANDA

Damn right I do

INT HERB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Several unrolled condoms are littered on the counter-top
Herb is naked in front of the mirror visible only from the
chest up He grabs another condom and tries to put it on

HERB
Motherfucker

WANDA (0S)
Herbie are you okay

HERB
I’m fine

The condom flies off into the mirror and sticks to the glass

HERB
I’ll be right out

Herb only has one condom left He opens the package closes
his eyes and takes a deep breath

After a moment he opens his eyes And he smiles

INT HERB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wanda is under the bedcovers Herb enters somewhat nervous
He turns off the lights and crawls into bed

WANDA
You like it dark huh

HERB
I guess so

WANDA
Do you like it dirty

Wanda immediately rolls on top of him All we see is their
silhouettes but things start to get a little sweaty

WANDA
Do you want to get inside me

Herb nods He wants nothing else And it’s all so
tantalizingly close Except for one small problem

HERB (VO)
Oh shit

Both Wanda and Herb stop moving An awful pause

HERB (VO)
This can’t be happening

Wanda rolls off Herb clearly disappointed

HERB
I’m so sorry
WANDA
It happens My hit ratio’s about
sixty-five percent

Wanda puts on her clothes and turns on the light

HERB
Please don’t go

WANDA
Don’t get possessive on me Herbie
I have to be somewhere else in
forty-five minutes But let’s try
again tomorrow night

HERB
Really

WANDA
Stop by room one-fourteen after
dinner Say five-thirty
(off Herb’s nod)
There’s just one thing I need to
tell you In my room the lights

She blows Herb a kiss and leaves

INT SPRUCE GARDENS CARD ROOM - DAY
Charlie Elmer Jules and Herb are playing bridge

CHARLIE
You didn’t take Viagra Who do you
think you are Wilt Chamberlain

ELMER
And you don’t have any condoms

CHARLIE
What did we tell you

HERB
(hissing)
I don’t know what I’m doing

ELMER
If you have a death wish fine
But Herb you bare-back these
chicks you’re just fucking the
rest of us
JULES
(deadpan)

just sticking it in and hoping for
the best

CHARLIE

JULES
Women’s liberation

ELMER
Internet porn

CHARLIE
Herb we need all the help we can
get And that little blue pill
It’s like the Apollo Program and
the Manhattan Project rolled into
one And your penis is the
beneficiary

HERB
Okay fine I get it So what do I
need to do

CHARLIE
Well everybodys got their
personal preferences but I like to
mix my own Viagra cocktail -- like
those drug combinations they give
to fairies with AIDS

ELMER
Hey my son’s gay

CHARLIE
I knew it was genetic

HERB
Come on please

CHARLIE
All right So an hour beforehand
I usually pop one forty milligram
Viagra That’s the standard
bearer your flagship

(MORE)

CHARLIE (contd)
I also take one-third of a Cialis
and one Levitra That’s your
backup Some of these girls want
to go two three times a night and
then again in the morning You
need reinforcements And finally
I recommend a few Advil just to
prevent any aches and pains

Charlie tosses a few pill bottles onto the table

CHARLIE
This should get you started

HERB
And what about rubbers

Elmer pulls a stash of condoms from his pocket and puts that
on the table too

ELMER
If you run out let us know Weve
got a connection at the pharmacy

HERB
(picks up a condom)
Do I need to use one of these if
she goes downtown

JULES CHARLIE
Yes No

ELMER
It’s complicated

HERB
How is Wanda in that department

CHARLIE
That’s complicated too Don’t get
me wrong She’s a very talented
girl But she expects you to
return the favor

Herb grimaces

CHARLIE
These days it’s kind of standard

HERB
Fuck

ELMER
I take it you don’t have much
experience down there

HERB
I don’t have much experience with
anything
(sotto embarrassed)
I’ve never even gotten a blow job

CHARLIE
Fuck off

HERB
I’m serious Jules will tell you
My wife wasn’t the most giving
person in the world

JULES
Don’t badmouth her Herb

ELMER
Her mouth certainly wasn’t doing
him any favors

Charlie and Elmer bump fists Snap

CHARLIE
Just tell Wanda what you told us
you’re an oral virgin She’1ll be
so happy to pop your cherry
reciprocity won’t be an issue

ELMER

(whispers to Charlie)
Maybe we should use that line too

INT HERB’S BATHROOM - THE NEXT NIGHT

Herb holds about six pills in his hand He swallows them one
by one It takes an uncomfortably long period of time

Next he grabs a roll of condoms from a drawer along with a
hand-drawn diagram depicting their proper usage

Finally he looks at himself in the mirror He brushes his
hair with his hand He checks his breath He’s ready

HERB (VO)
Let’s go fuck this broad

INT SPRUCE GARDENS HALLWAY - NIGHT

There’s a spring in Herb’s step as he heads towards Wanda’s

room He can already feel the pills kicking in

EXT WANDA’S ROOM - NIGHT

The number on the door says 114 Herb notices that the door
is slightly ajar He pushes it open excitement building
INT WANDA’S ROOM - NIGHT

--only to find Kate and two paramedics inside On the floor
is a white sheet with the shape of a human body underneath

All eyes turn to Herb Frozen in the doorway

KATE
(approaching)
Herb what are you doing here

HERB
(in shock)
I uh Wanda asked me to come
(beat)
Is she

Kate nods Her eyes start to water So do Herb’s Kate
hugs him touched by her perception of his sensitivity

KATE
It’s okay Herb She lived a full
life More than most

HERB
Tonight of all nights

As Kate hugs him tighter Herb’s eyes go wide The Viagra is
really working Herb quickly breaks off the hug and turns
his back to Kate trying to hide his erection

HERB
I’m sorry I I just can’t look

KATE
I understand I didn’t know you
two were friends

HERB
We werent

KATE
Oh

Herb realizes his misstep He quickly backtracks

HERB
It’s just seeing this and with
my wife It brings back some bad
memories

Kate gently puts her hand on Herb’s shoulder and turns him
around pulling him in for another hug To avoid detection
Herb is forced to do one of those awkward ass-out hugs

Meanwhile one of the paramedics notices Herb’s erection He
quietly points it out to his colleague

HERB
I’m sorry I think I need to sit
down

Herb moves to a chair and crosses his legs

KATE
It gets better

HERB
Excuse me

KATE
I have some experience with this
sort of thing When my husband--

HERB
You’re married

KATE
No

Herb tries to hide his relief

KATE
He died about ten years ago

Herb tries to hide how much he feels like an asshole

HERB
I’m sorry

KATE
Thank you But that’s what I’m
trying to say I know it’s hard
right now

The paramedics try to suppress a laugh

KATE
but give it time It gets a
little bit easier every day

Kate puts her hand on Herb’s shoulder It’s a tender moment
Herb re-crosses his legs

KATE
I have to contact her family Will
you be okay if I leave you here

Herb nods somewhat distraught But as Kate walks away he
still manages to get a look at her ass

Herb turns to the paramedics who give a silent nod towards
his crotch Herb embarrassed adjusts himself

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - DAY
Elmer Charlie Jules and Herb are at breakfast

JULES
Poor Wanda

HERB
Poor Wanda I couldn’t sleep last
night because of those pills My
dick was like a goddamn tire iron

ELMER
At least you know you’re still
packing

CHARLIE

It could have been worse She
could have kicked it while you were
inside of her

ELMER
A trauma like that will fuck with
your head

CHARLIE
And you’d never get laid at Spruce
Gardens again The girls here just
won’t take that kind of chance

ELMER
Your cock gets blackballed

CHARLIE
Might as well be ejaculating
arsenic

ELMER

A few years ago this guy James
Sutcliffe was banging this broad
Claire Cummings--

CHARLIE
No it was Sarah Livingstone

ELMER
Are you sure

CHARLIE
Claire Cummings was the one who
died from autoerotic asphyxiation
Sarah Livingstone checked out while
Sutcliffe was going down on her

JULES
Do we have to talk about this now
Wanda just died

Jules looks around the table The other guys just shrug

JULES
There are more important things
than sex

ELMER

Not to Wanda there weren’t

CHARLIE
Look Jules it’s an unfortunate
situation But a woman her age
with her proclivities it was bound
to happen

ELMER
Better a heart attack than
syphilis

HERB
So what happened to Sutcliffe

Elmer and Charlie look at each other

ELMER
Women shunned him Guys didn’t
want to be seen with him
(MORE)

ELMER (contd)
Eventually he had to move into one
of those homes for invalids He
died a few weeks later

CHARLIE
The paramedics found him naked
soft porn in the VCR and his hand
stuck in a jar of petroleum jelly

The conversation dies for a moment For these men death is
one thing It’s always present But to die like that

CHARLIE
It was sad

ELMER
From everything I’ve heard he was
really good at oral

JULES
(exasperated)
You guys are unbelievable I’m
going to take my fiber supplements

Jules leaves

HERB
So who’s next in line behind Wanda

ELMER
That’s the spirit Who says you’re
not part of the greatest
generation

CHARLIE
I think Eva is your best bet

HERB
She did make a nice carrot cake

ELMER
That’s not the only thing she does
with carrots

Herb looks confused Elmer just winks at him

CHARLIE
You’1l have to wait a couple of
days though This kind of thing
with Wanda dying and all the girls
take it hard But don’t worry
Soon enough everything will be
back to normal

And just like that conversation in the dining hall stops

The guys turn around to investigate And that’s when they
see MIKE MILLER enter the room Mid-60s tan chiseled
Elvis has entered the building Women look on in awe

HERB
Who’s that guy

CHARLIE
Maybe he’s the new tennis pro

Kate is walking next to Mike She brings him over

KATE
Hi guys I’d like to introduce
you to our new resident Charlie
Hasselback Elmer Williams Herb
Winter This is Mike Miller A
transfer from our Hartford branch

MIKE
It’s a pleasure to meet you

Stunned silence The table is too shell-shocked to respond

KATE
(to Mike)
Can I leave you here for a second
I just have to check on something

MIKE

(joking)
1965 I had a girlfriend say the
exact same thing to me Next thing
I knew she had changed her name to
Pollen moved to some commune
outside Berkeley and started giving
free hand jobs to local draft
dodgers

Kate laughs and places her hand on Mike’s shoulder

KATE
Ahh the sixties

Herb Elmer and Charlie look on blankly

KATE
Well I promise I’1ll be right back

MIKE
I think I can trust you

Kate smiles and turns to leave Mike stares at her ass

MIKE
God what I wouldn’t give to stick
my face in that for a couple hours
(pulls up a chair)
So boys what’s the word From
what I hear this place has more
free pussy than an animal shelter

Another stunned silence Nobody says anything Until

CHARLIE
No not at all

ELMER
You must have been misinformed

CHARLIE
The women here are frigid

ELMER
Like the polar ice caps

CHARLIE
Before global warming

MIKE
Really

HERB
Really The last thing to get laid
in this place was the foundation

MIKE
Hmm
(points to someone)
What about her
ANGLE ON PATTY DELANO
ELMER (0S)
Bitch
ANGLE ON IRIS SHALOV

MIKE (0S)
And her

CHARLIE (0S)
You need pliers to get her legs
open

ANGLE ON RENEE HARRELSON

MIKE (0S)
What about that one She looks
feisty

CHARLIEELMER (0S)
(in unison)
Total dyke

BACK AT THE TABLE
Mike looks frustrated But not altogether convinced
MIKE
That’s strange I mean I’ve only
been here for an hour but I
haven’t seen this many horny chicks

since abortion was legalized

Mike sees Kate across the room waving him over

MIKE
Speaking of which
(gets up)

Gentlemen

Mike is suddenly distracted by Eva walking past the table
They lock eyes A look of pure sex

MIKE
--I’1ll see you around

He leaves Charlie Elmer and Herb look on in disbelief

INT HERB’S ROOM - NIGHT
MUSIC fills the air The record player spins Mozart

Herb is in his La-Z-Boy wearing headphones When he gets
to refresh his martini he takes his headphones off

-and the MUSIC stops

In its place Herb detects a faint sound Like a WOMAN’S
VOICE And it’s coming from next door

up

Herb presses his ear against the wall And yes it’s
definitely there A WOMAN’S VOICE muffled

And then HEAVY BREATHING
--and GRUNTS
--and a bed CREAKING
And as it all gets louder and louder
-Herb finally realizes what’s happening next door
EVA (0S)
(Polish with subtitles)
Yes Yes Come inside me Come

inside me

Judging by the MOANS off-screen he does

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - WEEKS LATER

Herb Jules Elmer and Charlie are sitting at their usual
table Each one of them is looking across the room

What they’re looking at Mike entertaining a harem of seven
starry-eyed women He’s in the middle of a story And when
the punch line comes the table erupts in laughter

HERB
What an asshole

The four men turn to face each other With the exception of
Jules they look haggard unshaven Especially Herb

HERB
I’m thinking of soundproofing my
walls The guy goes all night
Every night

CHARLIE
He’s a machine

ELMER
Like Sting

More peals of off-screen LAUGHTER from Mike’s entourage

HERB
Jules what did you find out

JULES
He used to work in pharmaceutical
sales Apparently he has access
to this experimental drug that’s
not even FDA approved It’s
only been tested on gorillas so
far but supposedly it makes Viagra
look like chewable aspirin

HERB
He uses gorilla Viagra

ELMER
No wonder I haven’t gotten laid in
weeks

CHARLIE

Bobo the chimp is balling the whole
fuckin’ village

Another peal of LAUGHTER from across the room

CHARLIE
Will those two-bit whores shut the
fuck up

HERB

Let’s just calm down for a second
Jules how many clean names are
left

Jules looks at the list Most of the names are crossed off

JULES
Patty Iris and Renee
ELMER
No Not Renee Not anymore
CHARLIE
Bullshit
JULES

You guys have been trying to sleep
with her for years

HERB
Shut the fuck up Jules That’s
not helping So what So he slept
with Renee

ELMER
And another woman At the same
time

CHARLIE

He had a threesome

ELMER
Not only that I heard he did both
of them doggy-style

CHARLIE
He took them from behind

JULES
That’s got to be hell on his knees

HERB
Jules for the love of Christ shut
the fuck up

ELMER
No Not from behind The original
doggy style

HERB
What the hell does that mean

ELMER
You know going in a different
door

Blank stares It takes a moment for that to register

JULES
Oh my God

HERB
That’s disgusting

CHARLIE
Is he a fag

ELMER
I think that’s what the young kids
are doing these days

Herb turns around to look at Mike and his entourage He sees
Patty sit down at Mike’s table

HERB
And you wonder why this country’s
going to hell

INT HERB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Herb is in bed eyes open It’s peaceful Quiet Yet for
some reason Herb can’t sleep Then he removes an ear plug
and the peace is violently interrupted by

PATTY (0S)
Spank me Spank me

A beat And then from next door SPANKING

PATTY (0S)
Harder Harder

More SPANKING Harder SPANKING

Herb gets out of bed and puts on his robe

INT SPRUCE GARDENS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Herb in his robe and slippers walks through the deserted
hallways As he passes the music room he notices a piano in
the corner bathed in moonlight

INT SPRUCE GARDENS MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

A tumbler of gin is on top of the piano Herb sitting on
the bench takes a sip

He begins tapping on a few keys tentatively at first The
CHORDS sound vaguely familiar but it’s so slow and soft that
it’s difficult to make out the piece

Then Herb picks up the pace slowly finding his way And it
soon becomes clear that he’s playing the opening CHORDS to
Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony

Herb’s face once weary now looks focused Pissed even
His fingers pound the keys

Faster

Harder

With venom

It’s clear Herb has talent but this is not a traditional

Beethoven interpretation This is much more violent This
is a man unleashing his sexual frustration on a piano

And then all of a sudden Herb stops playing He is
drenched in sweat He looks exhausted Vaguely post-coital

The lights go on Kate is at the doorway

KATE
Jesus Herb What are you doing
(walks into the room)
You’re not supposed to be in here
this late

HERB
I’m sorry It’s just I uh I
couldnt sleep

KATE
(softening)
Oh

HERB
Was I bothering you

KATE
No no Don’t worry I was
working late and didn’t even
notice But then Dorothy Fischer
in room 210 woke up screaming
saying she was being raped by the
Phantom of the Opera

Herb hangs his head But Kate smiles

KATE
I thought you didn’t play the piano
anymore

HERB
I don’t It’s just I really

needed a drink and you know the
two things kind of go together

Kate picks up the tumbler and smells it

KATE
Gin

HERB
Beefeater martini on the rocks

KATE
Hmm I prefer Tanqueray Straight

up
HERB
Twist or olives

KATE
Twist If I wanted a salad in my
drink Id ask for one

Herb smiles They have something in common

Kate sits

HERB

Actually if I’m at a bar I ask
for a martini straight up too
But I get a glass of ice on the
side

(off Kate’s confusion)
A martini straight up contains more
liquid than one on the rocks but
they both cost the same This way
I pour the martini into the glass
of ice and basically get two drinks
for the price of one

KATE
Impressive

HERB
It was my wife’s idea She was
kind of a penny-pincher

KATE
Sounds like a smart lady

HERB (VO)
She was a miserly bitch

down next to Herb on the bench

KATE
Did you guys have a good
relationship

HERB
Umm well that’s an interesting
question

KATE
I’m sorry I don’t mean to pry

HERB
No no it’s fine I was just
thinking of how to answer that

HERB (VO)

You know how the female praying

mantis eats the male

HERB

You know those old couples you see
at restaurants The ones who eat
soup and don’t say a word to each
other the entire time That was
us Except we didn’t go out to

restaurants

KATE

Well I’m sure you still miss her

HOLD on Herb He nods And he’s so sincere that not only

does Kate believe him but so do we

It’s almost

heartbreaking the sight of this man thinking about his dead

wife A whole life captured in a sing

HERB (VO)
Like cancer

le moment

INT SPRUCE GARDENS MOVIE ROOM - NIGHT

A black-and-white movie plays to a half-empty room

his friends are in the back talking

CHARLIE

Are you fuckin’ high You’ve got

no chance

ELMER

Herb that’s her job To be nice

to you

CHARLIE
She’s like a stripper

HERB

Well I need to fuck somebody I

almost raped that piano
A feeble old man (EMERSON) tries to sh

CHARLIE
Shut the fuck up Emerson

already
(turning back around)

ush them

Youve
times

How about Iris She’s still clean

right

Herb and

The three of them look towards Jules the only one really
paying attention to the movie And the only one who actually
seems to have his finger on the pulse He shakes his head

ELMER
Really
JULES
(whispering)

They went into her room Saturday
morning and didn’t come out until
dinner time And she was limping

CHARLIE
He fucked her on the Sabbath

ELMER
Is there no such thing as common
decency anymore
Emerson tries to shush them again
CHARLIE
(to Emerson)
One more word and I’1l1 shove those
dentures so far up your ass youll
be shitting Fixodent for a month

Charlie turns back to the group A grim silence hangs in the
air Defeated they turn their attention to the movie

On the screen a buxom female gets up on a stage

and starts dancing

and shaking her hips

and wriggling her eyebrows

It’s the type of scene likely considered scandalous in 1932
But Herb and his friends now sit in rapt silence Engrossed
INT HERB’S ROOM - TEN MINUTES LATER

Herb enters and moves through the room quickly sure of
purpose single-minded in his pursuit He doesn’t even

bother to turn on the lights

He enters the bathroom and closes the door

EXT SPRUCE GARDENS - THE NEXT DAY

Herb Charlie and Elmer sit on a bench next to a pond Jules
is nearby tossing bread to the ducks The men on the bench
all sit in silence glumly staring at the water Finally

HERB
I’ve started masturbating again

Elmer and Charlie nod in silent assent

HERB
I really thought I was done with
that part of my life

ELMER
You know last night was the first
time I’ve masturbated since I’ve
been at Spruce Gardens

HERB
Really

CHARLIE
There was never a need

ELMER
There was never a time

CHARLIE
Besides Medicare doesn’t cover
Viagra It just seemed kind of
wasteful

Herb pulls out a pack of Marlboro Reds

HERB
I was saving this for a special
occasion

ELMER

You smoke

HERB
Not since I was a teenager but if
we’re masturbating again

He offers cigarettes to the others Charlie and Elmer each
take one They start smoking Occasionally they cough
HERB
This can’t be how it ends The
four of us sitting here feeding
the birds waiting to die

The men stare at the pond Two ducks nuzzle each other

CHARLIE
Those ducks wouldn’t even fuck us

More silence More smoking Until
HERB

You know what Fuck this And
fuck masturbation And fuck this

new guy
ELMER
What are you thinking
CHARLIE
Hookers
ELMER
Myspace
HERB

I’m thinking we can’t just resign
ourselves to defeat

CHARLIE
What are you gonna do Mike
Miller’s a human dildo

ELMER
The guy probably sweats sperm

Jules approaches

JULES
Two days ago I tried talking to
Helen Williamson Just talking
And she wouldn’t even look at me
None of them will

ELMER
They don’t want Mike to think
they’re sleeping around

CHARLIE
Fuck most of them aren’t even
conscious during the day
(MORE)
Everyone falls silent for a moment

CHARLIE (contd)
They’ve either been up all night
with Supercock or they’re resting
for their next go-round

ELMER
You know what Helen Williamson told
me the other day That she was
going to take a siesta Like a
goddamn European

CHARLIE
Vampire is more like it A
nocturnal bloodsucking whore

HERB
Look it’s not going to be easy
but hell I spent eighteen

months in Korea sleeping in rice
paddies and shooting at Communists
And I didn’t do it so I could grow
old getting blue-balled by some
sexual deviant in tight jeans We
can compete with this asshole We
just have to work at it

CHARLIE
I’m sorry Herb I’m too old for
this I’m out

ELMER
Me too It’s like my dry cleaning
business When the Orientals came
into town I knew it was time to
move on

HERB

Fine quit But you two already
had your run This is all I have
left

(turns to Jules)
Jules

(no response)
Come on Julie I need you

Jules sits in silence A long pause Finally

JULES
What do I have to do

Contemplating

INT HERB’S BEDROOM —- DAY

Herb is digging through his closet looking for something

HERB (VO)
Okay What I’m proposing is a
complete reconditioning of our mind
and body Mike Miller may be
younger than us He may be
stronger But that shit-bag
doesn’t have heart He doesn’t
have grit We can beat him

Herb pulls out a pair of old Converse sneakers

HERB (VO)
But first we need to get our asses
in shape

EXT SPRUCE GARDENS - DAY

Herb and Jules are dressed like tennis players from the

1930s

white shoes white pants white polo shirts Jules

also wears a headband

They are slowly walking along a running trail

JULES
Do you really think this is going
to help

HERB

Have a little faith Jules Today
we walk Tomorrow we run Soon
enough we’ll be tap-dancing around
that ass-raper

JULES
We’re not going very fast

HERB
We’re exercising goddamnit

The two continue their walk Herb starts to smile

HERB
That cocksucker is never going to
know what hit him

MIKE (0S)
On your left

Herb and Jules turn around

--just in time to see Mike blow past them A human blur in
nylon running shorts

Herb and Jules watch incredulous as Mike speeds down the
trail muscles rippling against his form-fitting tank top

EXT JACKSON’S HOUSE - DAY
Herb’s car stops in front of a dilapidated house

HERB (VO)
All right maybe we can’t compete
on stamina but I’1l be damned if
that son of a bitch is going to
beat us on technique Now I’ve
been out of the game a long time
So have you And apparently the
missionary position just doesn’t
cut it anymore It’s time for us
to find something new

Herb and Jules get out of the car Both of them look dubious
as they make their way up the weed-strewn path

HERB

How did you find this guy
JULES

The internet
HERB

What’s his name
JULES

Jackson Johnson
HERB

He has two last names
JULES

That’s what he called himself on

Craigslist
Jules KNOCKS on the door Nothing He KNOCKS again
JACKSON (0S)
I told you bitch I’11 pay you

tomorrow

Herb and Jules exchange a worried look

JULES
Uh Mr Johnson it’s Jules
Rosenbaum I e-mailed you about
your sexuality class for seniors

A beat Another And then JACKSON JOHNSON opens the door
He wears a dirty terrycloth robe A cigarette dangles in his
mouth He’s in his early 30s but looks ten years older

JACKSON
You got the money

Jules pulls out two hundred-dollar bills Jackson brightens

JACKSON

Well come on in boys Don’t
dawdle We got a lot of things to
cover

(sensing reluctance)
Don’t worry this’1l be fun
Jackson here’s going to teach you
old dogs some new tricks

INT JACKSONS HOUSE - DAY

Herb and Jules are sitting on a worn couch Jackson is
pacing back and forth smoking on a cigarette

JACKSON
Normally I like to take things
slow ease into it if you know
what I mean But I can tell you
boys are motivated

HERB
We are Very motivated

JACKSON
That’s exactly what I’m talking
about You’ve got that fire in
your eye Like Jon Voight in
Midnight Cowboy

Herb looks at Jules quizzically Jules shrugs

JACKSON
So we’re gonna skip the basics
You old-timers know how to tickle a
nipple You know where to find the
clitoris

JULES
Actually--

HERB
(kicking Jules in the leg)
Of course we do

JACKSON
You need something more advanced
right The freaky Hugh Hefner
shit that’1l make her eyes roll
back in her head and put her into a

coma
JULES
My God
JACKSON
That’s exactly what she’1ll be
saying

INT JACKSONS HOUSE - LATER

Jackson is sitting on the couch by himself smoking another
cigarette and drinking a beer

JACKSON
Okay now this is what I like to
call Mounting the Jackelope

In the middle of the living room Herb and Jules are each
“mounting” an inflatable sex doll from behind

The doll is in a complicated yoga position and Jules and Herb
are holding their doll’s arms straight out as if they were
antlers Jules does not appear to be enjoying himself
CUT TO
Jackson on the couch drinking his second beer
JACKSON
This one’s called the Mary Lou
Retton
Herb and Jules are holding their arms out in a V and arching
their backs just like the gymnast Except they’re holding
their sex dolls upside down by the ankles
CUT TO

Jackson on the couch drinking his third beer
JACKSON
And this one is my favorite It’s
called the Hula Hoop Only to be
used on special occasions

Herb and Jules are holding their sex dolls horizontally
curling them around their waists like a hula hoop

JACKSON
Jules bend your knees And Herb
start swaying your hips

The two of them do what they’re told

INT HERB’S CAR - NIGHT

Herb is driving Jules is shotgun It’s quiet Until

JULES
I think I slipped a disk

HERB
Don’t be negative Jules We just
have to stretch next time
(beat smiling)
You know if I had tried one of
those moves on Ellen she probably
would have screamed rape

JULES
Herb come on
HERB
What
JULES
She was your wife Have a little
respect
HERB

Respect this
Herb flicks Jules off
As the car approaches an intersection Herb slows down
squinting to see the traffic light The car behind him
HONKS Herb finally sees that the light is green

HERB
I can’t see anything

JULES
Are you even allowed to drive at
night

HERB

No But our lesson went a lot
longer than expected

JULES
Just be careful I don’t want to
get pulled over now

Herb nods in agreement as he looks in the rearview mirror
Staring back at him are two inflatable sex dolls

INT SPRUCE GARDENS ARTS AND CRAFTS ROOM - DAY

The room is packed with gray-haired women painting on
individual easels Kate wanders through the class

HERB (VO)
Next item on the agenda cultural
appreciation We paint We
mingle We outclass the son of a
bitch Plus women love a man
who’s good with his hands

Herb and Jules sit in the back the only men in the class

HERB
(whispering to Jules)
What did I tell you This place
has more beaver than Hoover Dam

Jules ignores Herb’s comment He’s focused on his painting
Kate walks by and gives Jules an encouraging nod She looks
over at Herb’s easel A very rough sketch of a nude woman

HERB
(embarrassed)
I’m not much of a painter

KATE
No It’s very Rubenesque And
a great way to prepare for today’s
assignment

Kate walks to the front of the room
A side door opens revealing Mike Miller in a

Mike walks to the front of the room and winks
gets up on a small pedestal pauses and then

his robe

Several women gasp

KATE
Okay everyone Get a fresh page
out and make sure you’ve got enough
paint Today we’ll be drawing a
live model And as most of you
already know one of our very own
residents has volunteered

HERB (VO)
Oh fuck

to something halfway down Mike’s body

HERB (VO)
I think we’re gonna need some more
paint

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - NIGHT

Herb Jules Charlie and Elmer are eating soup

HERB
Now I know why the guy pops gorilla
Viagra You could harpoon a whale
with that thing

CHARLIE
He’s a genetic mutation

ELMER
A one-man freak show

JULES
I’m surprised he doesn’t have back
problems

HERB
Jules Please
(beat)
You know he didn’t even have any
hair on his package

JULES
Maybe he has some sort of disease

at Kate
suddenly sheds

Herb’s mouth drops And his eyes

velvet robe

He

wander
CHARLIE
Yeah Elephantitis

HERB
No I think he did this
intentionally

ELMER

And you still think you can compete
with him

HERB
I have to try

CHARLIE
He scrapes razor blades across his
nut sac

JULES
Herb he’s right

HERB
You’re giving up too

JULES
I don’t know I came along to get
some exercise meet some new
people But all I got was a
sciatica in my back and a sex doll
in my closet

CHARLIE
You got sex dolls

Herb ignores the comment He rubs his face thinking
unwilling to give in

ELMER
Herb the guy controls this place
like Colonel Kurtz It’s
impossible

HERB
Nothing’s impossible

CHARLIE
He has abs

HERB
He’s just one man Nothing more

JULES
He drives at night
The conversation stops They all turn to Jules

HERB
What did you say

JULES
He can drive at night Legally

CHARLIE
You’re full of shit

ELMER
His eyesight can’t be that good

JULES
He took Helen Williamson to dinner
last night And from what I
gathered their reservation was at
eight o’clock

Everyone absorbs the news It’s significant

HERB
(soft)
What kind of car does he drive

JULES
A Mercedes

CHARLIE
Great He’s a fuckin’ Nazi too

JULES
He boned Helen in the backseat

INT HERB’S ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark except for a single wax candle

candlelight casts a pale glow on a plate of carrots nearby

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Herb staring intently at the candle
The other hand holds a half-eaten carrot

left eye

A KNOCK on the door breaks his concentration

HERB
(under his breath)
Who the fuck could this be

One hand covers his

Herb opens the door It’s Kate

KATE
I’m sorry Herb I didn’t mean to
bother you

Herb doesn’t respond The carrot dangles from his mouth
Kate looks over Herb’s shoulder and sees a burning candle a
plate of carrots and what may or may not be an inflatable sex
doll in the corner partially covered with a blanket

KATE
Did I bother you

Herb steps into the hall and closes the door behind him

EXT HERB’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Herb removes the carrot from his mouth

HERB
No no Of course not I was just
doing some vision exercises An
old Shoeless Joe Jackson trick

KATE
Who
HERB
Never mind
KATE
This is kind of a strange request
but I was thinking about you

recently
Herb drops the carrot onto the floor Kate looks at it

KATE
Are you going to pick that up

Herb bends down and grabs the carrot

HERB
I’m sorry what were you saying

KATE
It’s funny I was sitting in my
apartment and I thought of you

Herb drops the carrot yet again
HERB
(re the carrot)
Just ignore it

KATE
Anyway I was sitting there
looking at my husband’s old piano
and I thought I could really use
some lessons And maybe you could
give them to me

HERB
(deflated)
Oh

KATE
But if you’re busy

HERB
No no It’s fine I’ve gota
bunch of Mozart and Beethoven
records It’s pretty advanced--

KATE
Actually I was hoping to learn
some more modern stuff Like The
Beatles

HERB
Who

KATE
You know John Lennon Paul
McCartney

HERB
(no idea)
Oh of course The Beatles

KATE
Can you play on Saturday

HERB
I can play every day of the week

Herb realizes he said that aloud Yet again

KATE
Umm

HERB
(trying to recover)
Saturday is perfect

INT HERB’S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

The Beatles’ White Album spins on the record player Herb is
sitting in his La-Z-Boy headphones on as Jules flips
through Herb’s records

HERB
(removing his headphones)
These guys are pretty good

JULES
You’ve never listened to the
Beatles

HERB

There’s a lot of things I haven’t
done in my life Jules But this
is it This is my chance

(beat)
All my life I’ve set my
expectations low Settled for
mediocrity Hell for less than
mediocrity And even here -- in
this place in the twilight of my
life -- I let Charlie and Elmer
tell me that I wasn’t good enough
That I should content myself with
any old hag with two tits anda
functioning libido It’s pathetic

JULES
What are you talking about
HERB
(solemn)
I’m going to do it I’m going to
fuck Kate
JULES
(beat)
Whatever
HERB
What’s wrong with you
JULES
Nothing Do what you have to do
HERB
I will I let Ellen shoot down all
my ideas I’m not going to let you

do the same

JULES
(turning defensive)
Don’t blame anything on her

HERB
Look Ellen never appreciated my
musical ability And you know why
Because musicians get all the
chicks

Jules dismisses him with a wave of the hand

JULES
You don’t know what you’re talking
about
HERB
I know enough Jules I know
enough
(beat)

I know I don’t want to spend the
rest of my life sipping clam
chowder and popping wood because
the pharmacy has a two-for-one
special on lube

(beat)
And I know that you think this is
just about sex But it’s not
This is about my life What I’ve
spent my entire life waiting for
Fuck women’s lib This is my
sexual liberation My moment And
it’s the only thing I have left

Herb gets up out of his chair Determined A man ona
mission And so the MUSIC begins “Laid” by James

INT RECORD STORE - DAY

Herb is browsing through sheet music He picks up several
songs by The Beatles (including Let it Be”)

INT HERB’S ROOM - NIGHT

INT SPRUCE GARDENS MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Herb is practicing on the piano Some of the sheet music he

INT HERB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

and swallows another one

INT SPRUCE GARDENS HALLWAY - DAY

Herb walks down the hall and passes Kate He waves to her
She waves back As he passes by he glances at her ass

But as Herb faces forward he sees Mike Miller walking past
him in the opposite direction Directly towards Kate

HERB’S POV In SLO-MO Mike waves at Kate She waves back
He stops to chat touches her on the shoulder and makes some
remark She laughs And just like that

-the MUSIC abruptly scratches to a halt

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - DAY

The usual group in the usual spot Everybody is eating soup
Except Herb He has a plate of bacon in front of him

CHARLIE
So do those pills really work

Herb doesn’t answer He’s looking across the room

ELMER
I hear you get better results with
a penis pump

Herb ignores that comment too And now we see what he’s
looking at Mike and Kate chatting amiably Their
conversation breaks and Kate goes to her office

Herb’s eyes narrow as he scans the dining hall It’s fairly
empty right now but the ones who are here are all women

And not the ones we’ve become familiar with These women are
old They are infirm They are on the brink of death

And they are perfect

Herb’s eyes light up He pulls Jules aside for a private
chat In the background Elmer and Charlie discuss penile
enlargement techniques

HERB
(whispering)
I’ve got it

JULES
What

HERB
(whispering)
How to take Miller out of the
equation We engineer a Sutcliffe

JULES
Who

HERB
The guy whose cock got blackballed

JULES
What are you talking about

HERB
Who’s one of the most feeble women
here You know one foot in the
grave but still capable of basic
motor functions

JULES
Maybe Rose Chandler

HERB
Perfect I don’t know why I didn’t
think of this before

JULES
Think of what

Herb leans over and whispers his plan in Jules’s ear

JULES
No

HERB
Why not

JULES

You’re sick you know that Youre
a sick man

HERB
Sick of celibacy maybe

JULES
I’m not going to help you Herb
Youre on your own

HERB
Stop being so melodramatic Jules
We’re not on one of those soap
operas you watch

JULES
Melodramatic What you’re talking
about is murder

HERB
No What I’m talking about is more
like assisted suicide And for
these women think about it What
better way to go

INT SPRUCE GARDENS CAFETERIA - THAT NIGHT
Herb sidles up to Mike Miller Their initial conversation is
inaudible but we see Herb point out Rose Chandler across the

room Mid-80s she uses a walker and wears sweat pants

MIKE
Really

HERB
Really Rumor has it she was a
Playboy bunny back in the fifties
Knows all this freaky Hugh Hefner
shit that’1ll make your eyes roll
back in your head and put you into
a coma

MIKE
That’s a good thing

Herb shrugs

MIKE
Why are you telling me this

HERB
She’s been feeling a little down
lately and I’d do it myself but
Rose was married to a good friend
and I’d feel strange balling his
wife

MIKE
I see

HERB
By the way she likes it

Herb motions with his hands to suggest anal sex

MIKE
Don’t they all

Mike claps Herb on the shoulder and goes over to Rose Herb
watches them chat Mike lays on the charm After a couple
moments they leave their trays behind and exit

HERB
God bless him

Herb smiles and starts to follow but he runs into Jules
JULES
Tell me you didn’t
INT HERB’S ROOM - NIGHT

Herb has his ear pressed to the wall He’s drinking a
martini Jules is pacing back and forth

Faint NOISES can be heard from the other room

JULES

I should stop this

Be quiet

HERB

JULES

This is immoral

HERB

Shut the fuck up Jules I can’t
hear anything

Herb stops talking
It’s clearly a man

In the other room
--and Herb starts

In the other room

as the NOISES from next door increase
and a woman And they’re getting frisky

Rose starts to MOAN
to grin

the MOANS grow louder freakishly loud

and Herb looks freakishly orgasmic Jules looks nauseous

And then the MOANS

rise to an impossible crescendo Like the

cries of a stuck pig as the blood drains from its body

-and then SILENCE The air is deathly still

Herb can hardly contain himself He raises his glass to
Jules and takes a sip Jules looks inconsolable

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - DAY

Herb Charlie Elmer and Jules are at their usual table

Herb is grinning

Jules looks distraught

CHARLIE

He fucked her to death

HERB

His cock was a knife to her heart

ELMER

You saw the paramedics

HERB

No But you should have heard it
No living thing makes a noise like
that and survives

JULES
It was terrible Just terrible

Charlie and Elmer break into grins
HERB
Maybe we’ll get to use those

cigarettes after all

All three of them laugh The first real laugh they’ve shared
since Mike Miller entered their lives

--but it only lasts for a brief moment

Because just then Rose Chandler enters the room And she
looks hot Like she lost 20 years overnight

HERB
Holy shit

ELMER
He fucked her to life

JULES
Thank God

Jules incredibly relieved looks at Herb Herb looks away
He’s angry yes but also slightly ashamed of himself

Charlie and Elmer however continue to stare at Rose in awe
CHARLIE
Even I want to fuck him now
INT SPRUCE GARDENS MUSIC ROOM - DAY
Herb and Kate are sitting at the piano
HERB
It’s actually a simple arrangement
Here watch my fingers
Herb plays the opening CHORDS of “Let it Be” by The Beatles
HERB
And those same chords repeat

throughout the whole song

KATE
It still looks complicated

HERB
Slide over

Herb moves over and Kate slides to the middle Herb takes
her hands and places them on the keys

HERB
Okay well just take it slow

Herb gently guides her pushing her fingers against the right
keys Together they play the opening CHORDS of “Let It Be”

KATE
I’m playing the piano

HERB
See It’s not that hard

KATE
Let’s do it again

HERB (VO)
I’ve been waiting seventy-five
years for a woman to say that to
me

Herb guides Kate’s fingers back onto the piano They start
playing And then suddenly Kate closes her eyes and sings

KATE
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

She has a lovely voice And as Herb sits there his hands
touching hers skin on skin he becomes transfixed

The chorus rings throughout the room
-those three little words Calling to Herb Beckoning
-Let it be Herb Let it be
-he moves his face closer to Kate’s
-and closer

--until he catches himself at the last moment and pulls
back The music stops Kate opens her eyes radiant
KATE
That was better than sex

HERB
(in a blissful daze)
You were wonderful

KATE
So were you
(looks at the clock)
Damn I actually have to run

HERB
That’s okay

KATE
So what do I owe you

Herb’s face drops The fantasy is broken

HERB
Umm nothing It’s my pleasure
Really

KATE
I insist

HERB

No I can’t let you I’ve never
given anyone lessons and well
it’s

HERB (VO)
Making me hard

HERB
invigorating

KATE
Are you sure

He nods

HERB
But next time if you’re up for it
I think we should have the lesson
at your place

KATE
My place

HERB
This piano isn’t tuned all that
well And you should really learn
on the instrument you’ll be using
everyday That way you can get to
know it intimately

KATE
Okay Does tomorrow night work

HERB
Tomorrow night Umm okay

KATE
We can do it another time

HERB
No no it’s fine It’s just

Herb chuckles to himself trying to play it cool

HERB
- would you be able to give me a
ride

HERB
Sure

Herb wipes his palms on his pants He’s getting nervous

INT KATE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kate opens the refrigerator and bends to look inside Herb
stares at her ass His eyes glaze over

KATE
All I’ve got is beer Is that

HERB
That’s great

Kate closes the refrigerator and turns around Her hands are
empty She smiles at Herb seductively

HERB
Did you run out

KATE
No

She walks up to Herb and strokes her finger across his cheek
KATE

Did you really come here to play

the piano Because ever since I

saw you I’ve wondered what it

would be like to have your cock in

my mouth
She puts her lips close to Herb’s Achingly close

CUT TO

Reality

Kate is still bending over looking in the refrigerator

KATE
All I’ve got is beer Is that
okay

HERB

(waking up)
Uh yeah That should be fine

Kate turns around holding two cans of beer
KATE
Let’s check out that piano
INT KATE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Herb and Kate are sitting on the piano bench Herb points to
a picture of Kate and an unidentified man on the wall

HERB
Is that your husband
(off Kate’s nod)

He looks nice

KATE
Yeah Every time I look at him I
think of Mike Miller

Herb chokes on his beer

HERB
You don’t say
KATE
He fucked everything that moved

too

Kate forces a smile and takes a sip of her beer Herb tries
to lighten the mood

HERB
My wife was the exact opposite
She wouldn’t even fuck me

and it works Kate laughs Which makes Herb smile It’s
been a long time since he made a woman laugh

HERB
I learned a new song this morning
Would you like to hear it

She nods expectantly and Herb starts playing The song is
“Faithfully” by Journey

KATE
Oh my God I love this song

Herb smiles the kid at the record store was right And
then he starts to sing his rugged voice adding an
unexpected poignancy to the lyrics

-and Kate swept up in the moment joins in
HERBKATE
(singing in unison)
And love and a music man
Aint always what its supposed to be

Oh girl you stand by me
Im forever yours faithfully

Herb and Kate look at each other
Kate enraptured by the music

-Herb enraptured by her

And he just can’t help himself

He moves in and kisses Kate full on the lips just as the
actual “Faithfully” kicks in drums and all

-until Kate pushes him away And the MUSIC abruptly stops

KATE
What are you doing

HERB
(shell-shocked)
Uh I’m sorry I just

KATE
(gets off the bench)
Is this why you wanted to come
over

HERB
No no It was just the beer and
the music
KATE
(beat measured)
I think you should leave

HERB
Kate I’m sorry

KATE
Just please Go

Herb walks to the door berating himself for misreading the
situation But then he remembers something He stops and
turns around This is going to be awkward
HERB
Could you give me a ride home
EXT SPRUCE GARDENS - NIGHT
Herb gets out of Kate’s Honda Accord The car pulls away and

EXT JULESS ROOM - NIGHT

And with that Jules explodes

JULES

Herb looks a little scared He’s never seen Jules like this

JULES
I’m so sick of your bullshit Herb
Have you ever heard of mourning

HERB
What

JULES
(mocking him)
What What
(serious again)
The moment Ellen died all you
could think about was your cock
It’s all you’ve ever thought about

HERB
What’s gotten into you

JULES
(imitating Herb)
I’m going to do it I’m going to
fuck Kate
(beat)
Well congratulations jackass But
I don’t give a shit

HERB
I don’t think you understand
JULES
You didn’t love her
HERB
(confused)

What are you talking about

JULES
She was a beautiful caring woman

HERB
(a light of recognition)
Who are you talking about

JULES
You think she was cold

HERB
Are you talking about Ellen

JULES
You think she was frigid
The light bulb goes off for Herb And he stops being scared

and confused And he starts getting angry

HERB

She was
JULES

No You made her that way
HERB

I made her not blow me
JULES

Would you have returned the favor
HERB

That’s disgusting Jules
JULES

You treated her like shit
HERB

JULES

You went on the road to sell
fuckin’ typewriters

HERB
Did you

JULES
--and you never really came back

HERB
Did you sleep with her Jules

JULES
I loved her Herb

HERB
Did you sleep with Ellen

JULES
And she loved me

HERB
Did you FUCK MY WIFE

A long tense pause

JULES
No But at least I wanted to

Herb lunges at Jules just as “She Loves You” by The Beatles
kicks in It’s a fight yes but it’s kind of a pathetic
old man fight Like two drunk hobos pushing each other
--Herb takes a swing and misses

--Jules pushes Herb in the chest

--Herb takes another swing and hits Jules in the shoulder

--Jules grabs Herb and the two of them crash clumsily into
the hall closet The inflatable sex doll comes tumbling out

--Herb and Jules grapple with each other like wrestlers
Until finally Herb gets the upper hand and hits Jules
squarely in the jaw

Jules goes sprawling his fall broken by the sex doll

After a moment Herb falls to the floor too Physically and
mentally drained He catches his breath then looks over

HERB
Jules

and sees Jules grabbing his chest his face turning white

HERB
Jules

EXT JULESS ROOM - NIGHT

Herb watches as paramedics roll Jules out on a stretcher An
oxygen mask covers his face He’s alive but just barely

HOLD ON Herb his face blank Numb As THE CAMERA pulls
back we see Herb getting smaller and smaller standing all
by himself in the middle of the empty hallway

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL - DAY
Herb wearing the same expression from the night before sits
by himself in the dining hall eating soup Everyone keeps
their distance The rumor mill has just begun
ANGLE ON Iris

IRIS

I heard he attacked Jules with a
tire iron

ANGLE ON Patty

PATTY
--gave him thirty stitches

ANGLE ON Renee

RENEE

ANGLE ON Charlie and Elmer Even they keep their distance
Fear of guilt by association

ELMER
Poor bastard

CHARLIE
He’s the new Sutcliffe

ELMER
Yeah But it’s not just his cock
that’s been blackballed

As Herb continues to eat his soup in silence the other
residents slowly disappear from the screen

Herb is now alone The only other living thing in the room
is a Christmas tree twinkling in the corner

Kate enters and walks over to Herb

KATE
Hey

HERB
Hey

KATE

You gonna be okay
Herb nods He’s not very convincing

KATE
Any plans tonight

HERB
(lying)
Uh yeah I’m going over to a
friend’s house

KATE
Okay Well Merry Christmas

HERB
Merry Christmas

As Kate walks away Herb turns to look at her But he
doesn’t look at her ass For the first time he looks at
her Really looks And it’s clear he really cares

But she doesn’t turn around Once again Herb is all alone
Just him and his bowl of clam chowder

HERB (VO)
This soup tastes like cum

He pushes the bowl away

MIKE (0S)
Mind if I join you

Herb turns to see Mike Miller holding a tray of food In
normal circumstances Herb would mind but right now he’s too
numb to put up a fight He can barely manage a nod

MIKE
(sitting down)
So Merry Christmas
HERB
(soft)
Merry Christmas

An awkward silence descends Mike eats his food

MIKE
This soup tastes like cum
(pushes the bowl away)
You want to get out of here

HERB
Not really

MIKE
Come on well grab a drink Swap
some stories Maybe pick up a few
Jewish chicks

HERB
Thanks but

MIKE
Besides I owe you for that tip on
Rose Chandler I couldn’t feel my
balls for two days and I think my
eardrum’s been permanently damaged
but Jesus it was worth it

Herb doesn’t know what to say He laughs in spite of
himself

MIKE
What do you say

HERB
I don’t think so Mike

Mike points around the empty dining hall

MIKE
What you got other plans

HERB
No it’s not that It’s just
let’s just say I’m not really in
the mood to celebrate anything
INT BAR - DAY

Four empty martini glasses are on a bar

Mike and Herb sit in front of them glasses in hand
completely drunk They’re singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS

The bar is deserted for obvious reasons The bartender

looks on

LATER

disinterested This happens every Christmas

Six empty martini glasses Herb is in the midst of a story

LATER

HERB
And she whispers in my ear ‘Je
sucerai ta bite pour deux francs’

MIKE
(laughing)
Only two francs I would have done
that in a heartbeat

HERB
You speak French

MIKE

Enough to know the words for suck
and dick It’s come in handy a
couple times

(sips his drink)
In my opinion nothing compares to
French women They eat rabbit and
they fuck like ‘em too And the
best part is they don’t give a shit
if you screw around on the side

HERB
Let’s move to Paris

MIKE
Youre on

HERB
Hump some French chicks

Eight empty martini glasses The bartender is asleep Herb
and Mike have entered the philosophical stage of drunkenness

MIKE
Here’s my theory

He starts drawing an imaginary circle in the air

MIKE
Life death It’s a circle

HERB
A vicious circle

MIKE
Exactly And it’s round

HERB
I hope I die in my sleep

MIKE
That would be nice

HERB
I want a hot meal a cold martini
then Ill jack off go to bed and
never wake up

MIKE
I want to die during sex Hot
sweaty nasty sex

HERB
Really

MIKE
Definitely A womans pussy
delivered me into this world And
thats where I want to be when I
leave it

HERB
Life’s a circle

Mike makes a “circle” with his left thumb and forefinger and
sticks his right index finger through it

MIKE
Exactly

They both take a sip of their drinks

MIKE
So did you ever bang Kate Bentley

Herb almost chokes on his martini

HERB
What
MIKE
You were giving her piano lessons
right
(wiggles his fingers)
You didn’t try to slip your fingers
anywhere else

HERB
Umm no no
(softly to himself)
It wasn’t like that

Mike isn’t really paying attention

MIKE
I tried myself but she’s a classy
girl Which is probably why I
still want to fuck the shit out of
her

Herb is taken aback But he doesn’t say anything
MIKE
Bend her over a piano and give her

some real lessons

HERB
Mike maybe we shouldn’t

MIKE
Maybe that’1ll be my New Year’s
resolution

Herb increasingly uncomfortable changes the subject

HERB
Mike can I ask you a question

MIKE
Shoot

HERB
What are you doing at Spruce
Gardens

MIKE

What do you mean

HERB
You’re a young guy You don’t need
to be in a retirement home
MIKE
(conspiratorially)
You know Spruce Gardens is my
sixth retirement home in three
years

HERB
What

MIKE
I usually spend three to nine
months at each place depending on
the talent Then I move on

HERB
But why

MIKE
I’ve never found chicks this easy
Herb I’ve chased tail my whole
life and I just don’t feel like
putting in the effort anymore

HERB
No Why do you keep moving

MIKE

Eventually the girls get too
clingy or too catty I was at this
home in New Haven last year and I
had these identical twins who used
to go down on me at the same time

(off Herb’s reaction)
Yeah that was a nice place

(resuming his story)
Anyway these two broads start to
get territorial One’s only
allowed to tickle my balls The
other one just gets to lick the
tip Et cetera So one day
they’re down below and one of them
accidentally trespasses into the
other’s area I don’t really know
what happened But all of a
sudden these two broads are
clawing at each other Hitting
each other Pulling each other’s
hair out

HERB
That sounds amazing

MIKE
Maybe But one of the girls

fractured her

jaw and the other

broke her pelvis So it was time

to go

HERB
You know I’ve never even gotten a

blow job

MIKE

Bullshit

HERB

I’m serious
believe in it

My wife didn’t

MIKE
She didn’t believe in it It’s not
a goddamn religion

Herb shrugs

MIKE
That should be unconstitutional

HERB
That’s actually why I moved to
Spruce Gardens To experience

something new

something that would

make me feel young again one last

time before I
showed up

died Then you

Herb takes a sip of his drink Mike just stares at his

MIKE

Let’s get out

of here

HERB
Where do you want to go

MIKE

Just get up

Itll be my Christmas

present to you

HERB
What are you talking about

MIKE
What do you think We’re going to

get you blown

HERB
How

MIKE
You let me worry about the details

You just stay focused on the big
picture

deserted area of downtown

INT MIKE’S CAR - NIGHT

HERB

MIKE

MIKE
Herb--

HERB
I’m not going to pay some girl to
blow me

MIKE

Herb I’m going to pay her

HERB
That’s not the point

MIKE
Herb there’s only one point that
matters here

(MORE )
MIKE (contd)
And that’s the point at the end of
your dick You’re seventy-five
years old man Seventy Five
Years And you’ve never felt a
woman’s mouth wrapped around your
balls And you’re telling me
that’s living No that’s dying
Youre seventy-five years old and
youre fuckin’ dying This is your
chance Herb For the first time
in your life this is your chance
to really live it

Herb stares out the window

HERB
(small quiet)
Okay

MIKE
All right Now there’s a broad
here Sophie She once blew me for
two hours without coming up for
air

HERB
Two hours

MIKE
It’s like oxygen for this girl

HERB
Will she be working tonight

MIKE

Christmas than Wal-Mart

Mike reaches into his pocket

MIKE
Have you taken any pills today

HERB
No

MIKE
No Viagra No heart medication
No nasal spray

HERB
No Nothing

MIKE
Youre sure

HERB
Positive
MIKE
Okay Take one of these Just

He hands Herb a small black pill inscribed with a white xX

MIKE
This has only been tested on
gorillas so far But it’s safe
well pretty safe Do you have a
history of mental illness in your
family

Herb shakes his head

MIKE
Ever had rickets

Herb shakes his head again He looks a little scared

MIKE
Good Given how much we’ve had to
drink tonight we’ll need this
little baby

HERB
It works

MIKE
It’ll get a corpse hard You
ready

Herb nods They each swallow a pill The effect is
instantaneous

HERB
Jesus

MIKE
Powerful stuff huh Now let’s go

INT WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT

Herb and Mike enter a dimly lit foyer The MADAM mid-40s
dyed red hair stands behind a podium

MADAM
Hey Mikey Merry Christmas

MIKE
Merry Christmas Cherry This is

CHERRY (MADAM)
Herb it’s a pleasure

Herb smiles meekly It’s clear he’s uncomfortable

CHERRY

She’s pretty booked but for you

MIKE

MIKE
Are you okay

HERB
I’m just a little nervous Is

MIKE
What do you mean

HERB
Should I like guide it in Or
does she initiate contact

MIKE
Personal preference really but
since this is your first time Id
let her take charge

HERB
And during the actual session
do I offer encouragement Maybe
pat her on the head

MIKE
She’s not a dog Herb

HERB
I don’t know how this works
(beat)
How about when I’m you know

MIKE
About to finish

HERB
Right Should I tell her to get
out of the way

MIKE
Normally if you’re with a nice
girl I’d say give her a heads up
But these women are professionals
They know the risks

Cherry returns She ushers Mike and Herb through a curtain

CHERRY
This way gentlemen

INT WHOREHOUSE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Pretty much what you would expect dark carpets red
curtains girls in lingerie talking to lonely men A
Christmas tree is in the corner

The three of them make their way through the crowd

HERB
(still uncomfortable)
I never thought I’d end up ina
place like this

MIKE
What you worried someone’s going
to see you

HERB
No It’s not that

JACKSON (0S)
Herb

Herb and Mike turn to see Jackson wearing a Santa’s hat An
Asian hooker is sitting on his knee

HERB
(sotto)
Oh fuck
JACKSON

Herb Winter Holy shit

HERB
Hey Jackson

Jackson gets up from his chair

MIKE
(to Herb)
See you fit right in

JACKSON
What are you doing here

HERB
Oh you know

JACKSON
Who are you here to see

HERB
Uh Sophie I guess

JACKSON
Nice That girl can suck a fire
hydrant dry

CHERRY
(interrupting)
Gentlemen we’re on the clock here

MIKE
Herb

Herb nods He starts to wave goodbye to Jackson but Jackson
grabs him and gives him a hug

JACKSON
I’m so proud of you My protégé
(whispers in Herb’s ear)
Give her the hula hoop

INT WHOREHOUSE SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Cherry leads Mike and Herb down a dimly lit hallway MOANS
can be heard coming from various rooms

HERB
There goes my reputation

MIKE
Your reputation Who is that guy
going to tell Besides the mere
fact that you know him your
reputation just doubled in my book

(beat)

That’s your problem Guys your
age all you worry about is your
reputation your legacy how people
will remember you I got news for
you Herb nobody’s going to
remember you That’s what happens
to guys like us We fade from
consciousness

Those words register with Herb He turns to look at Mike
who is ogling a hooker walking past And his eyes harden
Is this really him Is this really what he wants

Cherry stops She points at two doors next to each other

CHERRY
Here we are boys Mike you’re on
the left Herb you’re on the
right Condoms are on the
nightstand K-Y jelly is in the
bathroom You want anything fancy
there’s a price sheet posted on the
wall Merry Christmas Enjoy

She leaves Mike turns to Herb

MIKE
Fuck your legacy Herb Fuck how
people will remember you

(MORE )

MIKE (contd)
The other side of this door that’s
what you should remember That’s
your legacy Now go grab it with
both fuckin’ hands and don’t let

go
(beat)
Just don’t cum too soon I’m
paying for a full hour
Mike enters his room
But Herb hesitates Unable to move Mike’s words ringing in
his ears He stares at the door almost as if it’s a mirror
And he sees
An old man
Alone
On Christmas
In a whorehouse

The anguish of it all writ large on his face

But he’s here And so is the door And so

INT SOPHIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-he walks into the room Small Sterile Designed for
one purpose SOPHIE late 20s surprisingly attractive sits
on the edge of the bed She’s wearing a robe

SOPHIE
Hi

HERB
Hi

SOPHIE

Do you want to sit down

Herb goes to the bed and sits down In the next room two
women are MOANING Mike is a fast operator

SOPHIE
So what would you like

Herb shrugs unsure what to say Sophie smiles seductively

SOPHIE
I’m sure we can think of something

She goes to the nightstand and turns on the radio “Santa
Claus is Coming to Town” begins to play She takes off her
robe revealing red lace underwear

SOPHIE
Merry Christmas

HERB
(nervous laugh)
Happy Hanukkah

SOPHIE
Oh youre Jewish

Herb shakes his head

SOPHIE
Well let’s find out for sure

Sophie kneels in front of Herb and starts to unbutton his
belt Herb nervously tries to initiate conversation

HERB
(re the belt)
That’s Italian leather
SOPHIE
It’s really nice Do you want me
to spank you with it
HERB
Uh no No That won’t be
necessary
As Sophie undoes Herb’s zipper
-Herb’s heart begins to pound
--and the MOANS next door grow louder
As Sophie pulls down Herb’s pants
-Herb’s heart beats faster
--and the MOANS next door grow stranger
Until finally Sophie pulls down Herb’s boxers

SOPHIE
You shave

Sophie looks at Herb and smiles But Herb doesn’t respond
He may be physically aroused but mentally he’s anything but

Sophie is just about to lower her head

when Herb puts his hand on her forehead

HERB
Stop

SOPHIE
Is everything okay

HERB
No

SOPHIE

I can do something else

HERB
(soft to himself)
I want something more

SOPHIE
Anything you want

Herb looks at Sophie for a moment She really is attractive

HERB (VO)
God the possibilities

HERB
No no It’s not you It’s
just I want to save myself for
somebody else

SOPHIE
(confused)
You’re a virgin
HERB
(beat)
In a manner of speaking

Suddenly from next door comes a woman’s SCREAM

INT WHOREHOUSE SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Herb enters the hallway hastily pulling up his pants just
as another SCREAM comes from next door Cherry races past
him and flings open the door

CHERRY
Oh my God
(shouting downstairs)
Call nine-one-one

Herb still holding up his pants looks in the open door

--and sees two leggy women crying sheets draped over their
naked bodies And Mike half-naked on the bed motionless

EXT SHADY PINES CEMETERY - DAY

Light rain falls on a small group of mourners gathered around
a simple metal casket The same rent-a-minister recites the
same prayer Herb dressed in the same suit looks on

HERB (VO)
I guess Mike was right Life’s a
circle And it’s round

Nearby Eva is crying on Elmer’s shoulder and Patty and Iris
are crying on Charlie’s The two guys secretly bump fists

The minister finishes speaking He’s about to give the
signal to the grave-diggers when Herb steps forward

HERB

I’m sorry I just wanted to say
something

(beat)
I didnt know Mike very well In
fact I hardly knew him at all
But I was there when he died
Actually I was nearby But Ill
always remember the last thing he
said to me It affected me in ways
I cant really explain Mike
touched people A lot of people

One of the mourners nods She looks like a prostitute

HERB
He lived how he wanted to live
And he died how he wanted to die
Say what you will but you cant
say that about many people

As Herb speaks Eva Patty and Iris slowly turn their heads
to him strangely touched by his eulogy

The funeral breaks And they swoop in

PATTY
That was lovely Herb

IRIS
So eloquent

PATTY
If you need a shoulder to cry on
you know where to find me

EVA
(whispering in his ear)
I‘1ll give you more than just my
shoulder

Herb nods but shows little interest in their offers He
excuses himself and goes to stand off by himself

As the crowd disperses Herb takes one final look at Mike’s
grave and then he starts walking

-but not towards his car And not towards the others But
deeper and deeper into the cemetery

EXT SHADY PINES CEMETERY - DAY FIVE MINUTES LATER

Herb is lying on the grass staring up at the gray sky He
is still wearing his black suit his tie undone

HERB
You remember the last time I was in
this position Acapulco 1954
The honeymoon suite at the Los
Flamingos

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Herb lying next to Ellen’s grave

HERB
It was the first time you drank
tequila And you were like a
cheetah A Mexican cheetah And
we got back to the hotel you
remember I was lying on the bed
just like this And you got on
top You were never on top And
you kept moaning ‘Si Julio si’
I just thought you were practicing
your Spanish

(beat)
(MORE)

HERB (contd)

I’m sorry Ellen God I’m sorry
about so many things I guess
well have a lot of time to talk
about it huh You probably don’t
want to spend the rest of eternity
buried next to me but we already
paid for the plot And I know how
much you hate to waste money

(tears forming)
So I’m sorry about that too But
what I’m really sorry about what
I’ve been thinking a lot about
lately I wish I had been the one
to die Then maybe you and Jules
could have been happy It’s the
least I could have done for both of
you

Herb wipes the tears from his face He stares up at the sky
HERB

You know this is the longest
conversation we’ve had in decades

KATE (0S)
Herb

Herb looks over to see Kate standing there dressed in black

KATE
What are you doing

HERB
(getting up embarrassed)
Uh I was just talking with my
wife What are you doing here

KATE
I was just talking with my husband

Herb nods It’s an awkward moment

KATE
What were you doing down there

HERB
Well this is where I’m going to
be buried

Kate smiles just barely but it’s enough to notice

HERB
Are you laughing at me
KATE
No Of course not

But she kind of is Herb smiles too

HERB
It’s the Eternity Package You get
buried next to your spouse and if
you buy it in advance you get a
ten percent discount Plus I think
there are some tax benefits

KATE
You were testing your burial plot

HERB
That doesn’t sound good does it

They both start to chuckle

KATE
No It sounds kind of strange

HERB
I’ve been doing a lot of strange
things lately

KATE
Oh yeah Like what

Herb immediately stops chuckling

HERB
Nothing special

Kate stops laughing too But she’s still smiling

HERB
Kate I’m sorry about what
happened You know before
KATE

Don’t be It was my fault too I
do that sometimes I send out
signals without realizing it

HERB
That’s funny I do the same thing
Except it’s usually the opposite
signal

They both smile again And they both mean it

KATE
So did you really spend Christmas
with a friend

HERB
In a really strange kind of way I
guess I did And you

KATE
Actually I spent it playing the
piano And I thought of you
(beat recovering)
I’ve been trying to learn Tiny
Dancer It’s not exactly a
Christmas carol but--

HERB
It’s my favorite Elton John song

KATE
(impressed)
Yeah

HERB

(explaining)
I’ve been listening to a lot of new
music lately trying to expand my
repertoire Have you heard of this
band Coldplay

Kate smiles and nods her head

HERB
They’re pretty good

And with that “The Scientist” by Coldplay kicks in

KATE
You should come over sometime Id
love to hear you play again And
maybe you know we could have
another lesson

HERB
I’11 do that

KATE
That would be nice

It’s a special moment a strange moment

and it’s about to get even stranger

Kate and Herb start to kiss All their feelings of
loneliness and longing channelled into this one moment

--and then they fall to the ground out of FRAME All we
see is Ellens tombstone watching silently

A few moments later Herb pops back up His hair disheveled
the top two buttons of his shirt undone

He looks at his wife’s tombstone He looks down at Kate
HERB
Do you mind if we go somewhere
else

INT KATE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kate and Herb are kissing with abandon as they move through
the living room

Kate starts undoing Herb’s belt

HERB
That’s Italian leather

KATE
What

HERB
Never mind

They keep awkwardly making their way to the bedroom It’s
all hurried And strange Yet somehow touching
INT KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Herb and Kate are in the midst of sex Herb is on top But
all we can see is their silhouettes

KATE
Yes More

HERB
More

KATE
Yes

That’s all the encouragement Herb needs He stops thrusting
for a moment steeling himself for something

KATE
What are you doing

and then he makes his move In one seamless motion Herb
tries to flip Kate onto her stomach fall onto his
back and pull her into a reverse mounted position All
without pulling out

Except about halfway through

HERB
Ahhhh

Herb grabs his back and bucks his hips Kate falls off the
bed to the left Herb falls off the bed to the right

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Herb wakes up in a hospital bed A doctor is reviewing his
chart Kate is in a chair a small bandage on her forehead

HERB
What the fuck happened

KATE
Herb are you okay

HERB
Where the fuck am I

KATE
You’re in the hospital

HERB
(re bandage)
What happened to you

KATE
(smiling whispering)
You don’t remember

DOCTOR
Mr Winter Good to see that
you’re conscious and still in

command of a full vocabulary

The doctor checks his chart

DOCTOR
Nothing to worry about really
You had some mild back spasms and
what looks like an adverse reaction
to actually I’m not really sure
Just out of curiosity have you
taken any new medication recently

HERB
(evasive)
No

DOCTOR
(looks up from his chart)
Nothing out of the ordinary

Herb shakes his head trying not to look too guilty

DOCTOR
Because I’m looking at your blood
test here And well there’s
traces of a drug I’m not entirely
familiar with

He looks inquisitively at Herb So does Kate Herb shrugs

DOCTOR
Fortunately there’s no long-term
damage to your heart or any
other organ But do me a favor
Mr Winter From now on stick to
prescription drugs okay

Herb nods nonchalantly The doctor leaves
KATE
Do I even want to know
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Herb is in bed eating lunch and watching TV
An ad for a retirement village comes on the screen Old
people play golf and tennis dance the conga et cetera It

looks like paradise

HERB (VO)
What bullshit

But as the ad continues it shows two old men sitting at a
table sharing a meal together Laughing
Herb looks at the TV screen At the food on his tray

his empty hospital room

-and slowly his eyes fill with tears

INT JULESS HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Jules is in bed connected to a heart monitor
in hospital garb pops his head in the door

HERB
Hey They said I could come up

Jules doesn’t say anything Herb approaches cautiously

HERB
I won’t stay long I just wanted
to bring you something

JULES
Is it a jar of Vaseline

Herb smiles The tension apparently broken

HERB
I can get you one

JULES
(re heart monitor)
That’s okay If I even think about
masturbating this machine starts
beeping

HERB
Actually I don’t have anything to
give you I just wanted to see you
and

Tears form in Herb’s eyes

HERB
God Jules I’m so sorry

JULES
This isn’t your fault Herb

HERB
Yes It is

JULES
You didn’t put me here My heart
did

HERB
I don’t mean this I mean
everything You were my best
friend Jules My only friend
And I never treated you like one

Herb wipes away his tears

HERB
I’m such an asshole

Jules hands him a Kleenex

HERB
I don’t know why but I’ve been
crying a lot lately

JULES
Maybe it’s those penile enlargement
pills

HERB
(smiling)
Maybe They haven’t really been
working

JULES
What are you doing in the hospital

HERB
I’d tell you but I’m afraid you
might have another heart attack
Jules arches his eyebrows He clearly wants to know
HERB
All right What do you want to
know
JULES
Everything
SAME LOCATION - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Juless heart monitor BEEPS rapidly Jules rips the sensors
from his chest The BEEPING stops

HERB
I told you

JULES
You had sex with Kate

HERB

Technically I’m not really sure
JULES

Technically
HERB

Well there was insertion but
JULES

No troop deployment
HERB

Right
JULES

I think that still counts

HERB
It certainly doesn’t feel like it

JULES
What did it feel like

Herb pauses for a moment He has to think about this

HERB
I don’t really remember

Jules cracks up And it’s infectious Herb laughs too

HERB
You know the only thing that’s
really clear to me Just before I
blacked out maybe it was the
pills but I had one of those near-
death experiences And this one
image kept popping up in my head

JULES
Like a white light

HERB
No It was your face

Jules blanches

HERB
I think what happened is my entire
life flashed before my eyes And
the only constant the only thing
worth remembering has been the
times I spent with you

Herb takes Jules’s hand

HERB
I love you Jules

JULES
I love you too Herb

Herb leans in and tries to give Jules a hug but it’s kind of
awkward with Jules lying down Herb almost has to crawl into
bed next to him Jules pats him on the back

JULES
Just don’t think of me the next
time you’re having sex

EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

Kate is pushing Herb’s wheelchair out the front of the
hospital The sun is shining A beautiful winter’s day

KATE
Gorillas

Herb hangs his head He gives her a sheepish nod

KATE
That explains a lot

HERB
To be fair I think I’m still
capable of performing at an
adequate level

KATE
Just adequate

HERB
Maybe above adequate

KATE
Maybe next time just give me a
warning if you want to do something
like that

HERB
Next time

Kate stops the wheelchair She smiles and whispers something
in Herb’s ear

and slowly almost imperceptibly he starts to smile

INT SPRUCE GARDENS DINING HALL

All the familiar residents of Spruce Gardens are standing
around Herb’s table Jules is sitting to his left The seat
to his right is empty

Kate appears carrying a birthday cake with seventy-six
candles on it And as everyone breaks into “Happy Birthday”
the sound cuts out

and all we hear is Herb’s voice

HERB (VO)
My name is Herb Winter

Kate puts the cake in front of Herb

HERB (VO)
Today is my seventy-sixth birthday

Kate sits down next to Herb and secretly squeezes his leg

HERB (VO)
And just so we’re clear I’ve been
promised a pretty damn good
present

Herb blows out the candles and grins There’s nothing
imperceptible about it Herb Winter has never been happier
in his entire life

FADE OUT
