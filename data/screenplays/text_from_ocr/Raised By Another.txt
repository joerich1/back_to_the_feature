TEASER
NOTE THE EVENTS OF THIS SCRIPT FOLLOW THE EVENTS OF WHAT
WILL BE PUBLISHED AS EPISODE 108 NONE OF THE INFORMATION
FROM 108 IS RELEVANT IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE

PURE SILENCE Then THE DISTINCT SOUND of a BABY’S CRY rises
as we PUSH THROUGH the “O” of the LOST logo onto --

A CLOSED EYE SNAPS OPEN as we hear the CRY again and --
INT THE VALLEY - CLAIRE’S CUBBY - NIGHT 1

CLAIRE BOLTS UPRIGHT INTO FRAME And we’re EXTREMELY CLOSE
on her She’s confused Disoriented Couldn’t have heard --

The BABY CRIES again Distant but not too distant

And instinctively Claire’s hand falls to her belly and her
face REGISTERS this before we MOVE DOWN to find --

Her belly is perfectly FLAT She’s not pregnant And she’s
trying to make sense of how this is possible as we REALIZE --

Claire is in one of the small cavescubbies inside the
valley The CRY again Coming from outside the caves

And whatever the fuck is going on Claire is DRAWN TOWARDS
that sound so --

We FOLLOW HER as she leaves the caves and enters --
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 2
Moonshadows mix with mist A WHISPERING wind STARS

brighter in the sky than we’ve EVER SEEN THEM And a baby
Somewhere out there -- STILL CRYING

And this is really fucking SCARY Anything could be out
here Claire very aware of this but moving through the
DENSE FOLIAGE anyway And suddenly --

A BRANCH CRACKS

Claire spins -- SOMETHING flashes through the thick brush --
SOMETHING FAST --

Claire stumbles back -- steadies herself with one hand on the
TRUNK of a LARGE TREE And oddly enough embedded in its
trunk are two PINK LINES like RINGS around the tree They
seem to GLOW in the moonlight And Claire is as perplexed by
them as we are but

The baby cries again And it’s closer now More URGENT
Distressed A WAIL

Claire lets go of the tree -- still scared but DRIVEN now --
PUSHING THROUGH the thick LEAVES until she emerges into --

A CLEARING

And Claire comes to a full STOP as she sees --

LOCKE Sitting at a LARGE WOODEN DESK eyes down flipping
over what look like LARGE PLAYING CARDS by the light of a
PURPLE SHADED DESK LAMP

This makes as much sense to Claire as it does to us --

CLAIRE
Wh -- what’s happening

LOCKE
You know what’s happening

Locke turns over another card Claire FREAKED takes a step
closer to the desk --

CLAIRE
I don’t understand -- Why are
you

The CRY again Anguished In trouble Locke nods his head
towards the sound --

LOCKE
He was your responsibility
(turns a card)
But you gave him away Claire

FINALLY Locke looks up -- And both his eyes are OPAQUE ONE

is SOLID BLACK One is solid WHITE

LOCKE (CONTD)
Everyone pays the price now

Oh SHIT Claire backs off TERRIFIED as LOCKE SHOUTS AT
THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS

LOCKE (CONTD)
EVERYONE PAYS THE PRICE NOW

And Claire TAKES OFF running --

LOST Raised by Another (BLUE ) 92204 3
(CONTD) 2

Running towards the sound of the CRYING BABY Even MORE
DIRE The jungle even THICKER The noises around her even
SCARIER And we’re so close on her -- SO IN HER HEAD as
she’s literally being SUFFOCATED by the jungle until --
Claire BURSTS into --

ANOTHER CLEARING

And here is A BASSINET White Crisp linens A MOBILE
hangs from a TREE BRANCH above it

And the CRIES are gone Eerily SILENT
Part of Claire doesn’t want to look inside but she has to
Slowly moves towards the crib as we get a better look at the

MOBILE --

Half winged busted TOY AIRPLANES hang from its strings --
THE OCEANIC LOGO clear on them all

And as Claire looks down into the crib all we can make out
is THICK BLANKETS And as Claire reaches for what’s SWADDLED
INSIDE --

The mobile TURNS ON And eerie tinkery tune -- “Catch a
Falling Star” The fractured PLANES begin to SPIN --

And Claire ignores this as her hands DIG into the blankets

but something is wrong something is seriously wrong --
And the JUNGLE around us is ALIVE -- SHADOWS WHISPERS and
THINGS MOVING FAST -- The SONG in high gear CHIPMUNKS SPEED -

- and those once white blankets are NOW COVERED IN THIS
VISCOUS DARK LIQUID until FINALLY --

The MOBILE STOPS The jungle is STILL

And Claire pulls a PRISTINE BABY from the blankets

Wait No It’s not a baby It’s a DOLL Plastic
Diapers Eyes closed And Claire just holds it Scared
Confused A beat Another beat

And the Doll’s eyes FLIP OPEN as it CRIES An INHUMAN HOWL

Claire DROPS it -- PETRIFIED -- STEPPING BACK -- TRYING TO
GET AWAY -- And that’s when she realizes -- There is
something DARK all over her HANDS LIQUID

CLAIRE SCREAMS And we --

SMASH CUT TO
LOST Raised by Another (PINK) 92304

INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 3

SUPER TIGHT ON CLAIRE AS -- SHE SCREAMS

And we PULL BACK to find her STANDING in the middle of the
valley Alone Waning FIRELIGHT

And now STIRRING People waking up to the sound of the
SCREAMS And it’s --

CHARLIE who reaches her first -- Claire STILL screaming --

CHARLIE
Claire Claire

No idea what the fuck is going on Charlie grabs her by the

shoulders -- And she WAKES up -- EYES WIDE -- AS SCARED AS
SHE’S EVER BEEN -- instinctively LASHING OUT at Charlie --
CHARLIE (CONTD)
Claire -- Stop It’s me -- It’s
Charlie -- It’s okay

In the far background SUN JIN HURLEY and MICHAEL arrive
from other areas of the caves They’ve heard the screams
As they meet up fast overlapping --

SUN MICHAEL
(in Korean) I think it’s Claire
Whats going on

HURLEY JIN
Is she okay (in Korean)
Is it the baby

Meanwhile Charlie is still trying to rouse Claire --

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Claire Listen to me --

And finally Claire zeroes in on Charlie Blinks Confused

CHARLIE (CONTD)
It’s okay
(consoling)
You were dreaming --

sleepwalking

And that’s when Charlie’s eyes drop Sees something

What happened

And we can feel it before we see it Claire looks down at
her hands -- in fact all the way up to her wrists --

They’re covered in blood

ACT ONE
INT THE VALLEY - INFIRMARY CAVE - MORNING

We find Claire with JACK over in his INFIRMARY AREA He’s
putting on his bedside manner as he examines her HANDS
She’s still shaken up but putting on her best game face

JACK
Must’ve been a hell of a nightmare

CLAIRE
(forced smile)
Who says it was a nightmare

Jack rips off a PIECE OF BANDAGE delicately wraps Claires
hand in it as we see FOUR DEEP CUTS embedded in her palm

JACK

I’d say when someone makes fist so
tight they dig their fingernails a
quarter inch into their palms
they’re not dreaming about pony
rides

(her eyes drop)
Y’ever sleepwalk before

CLAIRE
No I mean I don’t think so-- I
mean how would I know

JACK
Itd get back to you I hada
girlfriend once told me I talked
in my sleep

CLAIRE
What’d you say

JACK
Don’t know Whatever it was she
didn’t like it
Claire cracks a GRIN as Jack BANDAGES her other hand --

JACK (CONTD)
How was your OBgyn -- in Sydney

CLAIRE
Good She’s good

LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104
(CONTD) 4

JACK
She was okay with letting you fly
in your third trimester

There’s something here Something Claire doesn’t wanna TELL

CLAIRE
I had a checkup the week before
she said it would be okay

JACK
Ultrasound cool

CLAIRE
Yeah Very healthy

JACK
How’ve you been feeling

CLAIRE
My back hurts Probably from
sleeping on the ground I get
dizzy when I stand up too fast
And I have to pee all the time

JACK
(smiles)
Eating enough

CLAIRE
Boar N’ Bananas yeah

JACK
(finishes bandaging)
How many weeks in are you
(off her uncertainty)
- what was the date you found out
you were pregnant

We’re ON CLAIRE as she can’t help but recall

INT LOFT - DAY - FLASHBACK 5

A small typically messy Sydney loft of a 21 year-old guy
Canvases and paints CDs and clothes and posters and food
and it’s comfy but definitely a young person’s first place
There have been lots of parties here -- but this moment is
not one of them the guy who lives here THOMAS is freaking
out -- as is CLAIRE -- both of them walking across the small
place from the open bathroom door towards the window for
light -- she’s holding a PREGNANCY TEST WAND

LOST Raised by Another ( YELLOW) 92304

(CONTD) 5
THOMAS CLAIRE

-- is it pink -- I don’t know yet
-- Did you pee on it -- Yes Gimme a second--
-- maybe you didn’t use it
right -- -- I can pee on a wand
-- what color is it Thomas--

(checking his watch) -- how long has it been

-- sixty-six seconds

They’re at the drapeless window now both closely studying
the wand waiting for the result CLOSE ON THEM (maybe
HANDHELD CAMERA) in this tense-as-hell moment We love her -
- and we like him too -- for caring so much He’s such a
guy but he’s got a heart HOLD ON THEM for a long beat

THOMAS CLAIRE
-- oh God-- -- shh

Suddenly Claire holds up the INSTRUCTIONS re-reads them as
Thomas holds the wand checking it again

THOMAS CLAIRE
-- okay it’s definitely two--
two lines-- -- two pink lines

THOMAS
Pink No-- these are like red

CLAIRE
(eyes on the wand)
- they’re pink

THOMAS
-- these That’s
A beat shit She stares off tears coming to her eyes
But Thomas doesn’t want to give up -- his mind racing
THOMAS (CONTD) CLAIRE
Okay first of all these
tests are not always -- Thomas
accurate

THOMAS (CONT’D)
No come on my uncle thought he
had testicular cancer -- remember
that

CLAIRE
He did He’s dead
LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104
(CONTD) 5

THOMAS
No it was a-- a-- wrong a bad
diagnosis This thing doesn’t mean
for sure that you’re pregnant -- we
should go get another one--

CLAIRE
I’m six weeks late Six weeks
That never happens
(beat then simply)
I’m pregnant
(tears)
so um

-- but she’s so afraid -- there’s really nothing to say --
and she’s staring off her mind racing tears streaming down
her face What the hell is she gonna do Thomas is freaking
too -- but he’s too good a guy So he takes her holds her

THOMAS
Okay Okay so this is gonna be
okay

CLAIRE

(not at all believing it)
I know

Then we’re ON THOMAS as a thought comes to him He looks
into Claire’s eyes Considers this before he says it Then

THOMAS
Claire
(then)
if we wanted we could do
this

And staring into his eyes she starts to understand what he
means And this moment goes from being horrifying to
being only a little less horrifying

CLAIRE
Stop it

THOMAS
No I’m not kidding

CLAIRE
Can you imagine that
(then)
My mom would disown me--

LOST Raised by Another (BLUE ) 92204

(CONTD) THOMAS
She basically has already
A beat Then she can’t even consider it
CLAIRE

With what my five dollar an hour
job at the Fish N’ Fry

THOMAS
You’re not the only one with a job
I mean I’ve got my art

CLAIRE

(doesn’t wanna go there)
You’re sweet But this isn’t what

we want

THOMAS
Maybe it is I mean this could
be I dunno the best thing ever

She’s still obviously shocked at the whole situation

But
this idea -- of keeping the baby -- bends her mind She’s

never considered something like this before But she likes

him Christ maybe this could work

CLAIRE
youd really wanna
THOMAS
Claire I love you
And she cries a little more now as he kisses her -- a
convincing kiss -- and we CUT TO

EXT BEACH - DAY

And here’s KATE just standing at the edge of the ocean

Watching as the foam of tired waves washes over her feet

stops a few feet from her --

JACK
This is a first

Kate turns and sees Jack
JACK (CONTD)

You Standing still Middle of
the day Doing nothing Amazing

As Jack takes off his shoes and Kate looks at the ocean --

He

KATE
I’m doing something

JACK
Yeah What’s that

KATE

I’m sinking

(beat)
When the water goes out it takes
the sand with it and you sink

(a smile then)
I used to do this with my Mom
When I was a kid

Jack is surprised by this quiet and gentler Kate -- he steps
up to the water line Next to her

JACK
Ah A new plan -- sink your way
off the island Sayid would be

proud

Kate reacts to the sound of Sayid’s name Looks up at Jack --

KATE
He’s been gone almost a week

JACK
Something tells me he’1l be okay

Kate nods Turns back to the ocean --

KATE
So what’re you doing Jack

JACK
Bringing down some water Bringing
back some fish

KATE
Whatever would we do without you

Jack shakes his head smiles A few beats pass Jack just
looking out at the ocean And then --

JACK
Claire’s going to have the baby
soon

Kate turns to him And as we see the real WORRY on Jack’s
face the full implications of what that actually MEANS

EXT THE VALLEY - ENTRANCE - ROCK WALL - DUSK 7
Claire writes in her JOURNAL The occupants of the valley
BEDDING DOWN for the night -- starting to light their fires

CHARLIE (0S)

“Dear Diary -- Still on the bloody
island Ate a bug today Love

Claire”

Claire looks up to see CHARLIE Smiles as he hands her a cup

of STEAMING liquid --

CHARLIE (CONT’

D)

What separates us from these savage
Yanks if we do not have tea

(sits then)
Feeling better

CLAIRE
It was just a dream
CHARLIE
I have this dream -- craziest

thing I’m driving a bus and all
my teeth start falling out And my
mum’s in the back Eating

biscuits
(beat)

‘Course I don’t wake up screaming

CLAIRE
I’m fine Charlie

And it’s clear from her tone that Claire clearly doesn’t want

to talk about this

CHARLIE

Right Well Of course you are

And now a somewhat awkward moment

Charlie obviously wanting

to SAY something here -- and he’s a little bit NERVOUS so it
comes out in sorta one sustained THOUGHT --
LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104
(CONTD) 7

CHARLIE (CONTD)

Anyway I was just thinking how
hard it must be for you y’know
being here in this place --
without your family and your
friends and I just wanted to tell
you that we could be friend -- I
mean I could be your friend

(off her look)
Not like we should do each others
hair or anything -- I just mean

(beat sincere)
If you ever needed anyone to talk
to About anything I’m here

And while Claire might be touched by all this there is also
a part of her that PULLS BACK as a result of it Simply put
she is uncomfortable with Charlie’s affection

CLAIRE
Charlie trust me You don’t
(trying to find the words)
You’1l change your mind I’m

Charlie’s hurt but does his best to cover with humor --

CHARLIE
Lemme guess Damaged goods

CLAIRE
Something like that

Charlie feels like he put himself out there and got shot down
for it He’s embarrassed Forces a smile as he gets up --

CHARLIE
All right then

CLAIRE
I didn’t mean you--

CHARLIE
Sweet dreams Claire

HOLD ON Claire as Charlie walks off Disappointed Maybe
with HERSELF As she takes a SIP of the tea we CUT TO

EXT MALKIN’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK 8
Claire walks with her friend RACHEL towards the entrance

of a MODEST HOUSE in suburban Sydney Rachel playfully rubs
her hand over Claire’s still FLAT belly --

LOST Raised by Another (BLUE ) 92204 13
(CONTD) 8

RACHEL
-- oh yeah it’s a girl

CLAIRE
(smiling nervous)
-- God it just feels impossible
(then brightly)
Thomas cleaned out his whole
apartment -- I’m officially moving
in on Tuesday--

RACHEL
-- wow --

CLAIRE
-- I know he’s the best

Rachel goes to knock on the door but Claire stops her is
having second thoughts

CLAIRE (CONTD) RACHEL
Maybe we shouldn’t --
-- Uh uh You’re not backing
out now --

CLAIRE (CONTD)
It feels silly --

RACHEL
He’s just a psychic Claire I
thought you were into this all
your astrology stuff

CLAIRE
is for fun I don’t need
someone telling me what’s gonna
happen or how to live my --

RACHEL
It’s not about what you need
Claire It’s about what’s fun

(then)
Youll go in find out if it’s a
boy or a girl -- I mean the

doctors can’t tell until you’re at

least two months preggers
(then)

So unless you have another

excuse

Claire doesn’t have one she can articulate so Rachel knocks
on the door and we go to

LOST Raised by Another ( YELLOW) 92304

INT MALKIN’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY - FLASHBACK 9

Quite a crowded place save for the BARKING DOG coming from
a nearby apartment Piles of books Dark and musty You
can see the dust in the air A cat may occasionally jump up
on the stacks of newspapers and mail then back down again

In the middle of it all Claire sits across a table from
RICHARD MALKIN Australian (60’‘s) Doesn’t look sharp at
all wears a dark blazer and tie There’s something oddly
legit about how he does his thing No evident humor from
Malkin Not a bad guy but a touch odd Takes this
seriously Rachel is in the bg

MALKIN
I need your hands For this

And Claire offers them palms up He looks at her palms
Closes his eyes for a long beat lLeans his head back a
touch Claire finally subtly turns to Rachel who
indicates for her to turn back to Malkin She does

MALKIN (CONTD)
oh
(then)
- when did you uh Find out

TIGHT ON CLAIRE as she stares Already this is weird

CLAIRE
- what

There’s a beat -- we’re TIGHT ON MALKIN as he listens eyes
closed to whatever voices talk to him Despite the
surroundings this is an increasingly eerie moment

MALKIN
you know about the baby

And holy fuck does Claire just go still Claire is freaked
Christ she almost wants to cry She turns to Rachel --
shoots her a look -- did you tell him Rachel shakes her
head no -- she didn’t She’s just a freaked as Claire is
Claire turns back to Malkin

CLAIRE
uh two days ago

Malkin listens searches on some kind of journey sitting
there he seems to encounter something that disturbs him --
creates a huge question -- something that makes him open his
eyes and check Claire’s palms

a
LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104 15

(CONTD) 9

Claire watches him closely -- what the hell is he doing
RACHEL CLAIRE

She hasn’t told her mom yet --

were afraid she-- Shhhh

TIGHT ON MALKIN as he studies her hands -- and apparently

sees something -- something that concerns him deeply --

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
What What should I not tell her

Suddenly Claire wants to know what he thinks But Malkin
holding her wrists staring at her hands does the best he
can to hide the utter terror that begins to creep up on him --

he only wants to run the hell away -- but he doesn’t want to
show his fear He lets go of her -- saying
MALKIN

I’m not uh
(then agitated)
I’m overdue for a break --

Claire and Rachel are confounded as Malkin goes to his pocket
-- counts out and hands back the money --

RACHEL CLAIRE
What A break We have an -- hold on-- were you
appointment -- thinking something

MALKIN (CONTD)
(standing)
I’m not doing this reading

CLAIRE
But you were gonna say something--

But Malkin ushers them to the door As he opens it and
motions for them to leave --

MALKIN
Go Now

After a beat Rachel snorts her displeasure laughs

RACHEL
What a freak

And Rachel heads out -- but we HOLD ON CLAIRE who looks off
surprisingly troubled by what she saw in Malkin’s face

LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104 16

INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 10

NIGHT has fallen again The pure STILLNESS of the valley
suggests we are in the WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING

THE CAMERA DRIFTING THROUGH IT ALL Something OMINOUS about
this Quiet Still And CREEPY And finally we REST ON --

INT THE VALLEY - CLAIRE’S CUBBY - CONTINUOUS 11
CLAIRE Sleeps on her side hand on her belly ON HER BABY

And the CAMERA gets EXTREMELY CLOSE until Claire’s face FILLS
THE FRAME And we just SIT here as --

We begin to hear SOUNDS Unsettling noises METAL AGAINST

METAL -- not unlike a SWORD BEING UNSHEATHED Huh
Claire’s EYES suddenly POP open -- Instantly aware that
someone or SOMETHING is HERE with her -- looks down to see --

SOMEONE IS STANDING OVER HER

The SHADOW moves quickly -- COVERS HER MOUTH with his (its)
free hand

Maybe a man And Claire is fucking petrified with fear
because it’s not just that he’s here it’s what he’s doing

And this is highly STYLIZED -- TWENTY QUICK CUTS -- ONE

SECOND EACH -- CONFUSING -- DISTURBING -- BIZARRE --

HERE is what we catch quick GLIMPSES OF Claire’s SHIRT is
pulled up -- BARE STOMACH EXPOSED -- SHE STRUGGLES -- A WEIRD

METALLIC DEVICE pressed up against her belly -- AN OVERSIZED
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE DESIGNED BY HR GIGER -- CLAIRE’S FEET
KICK AT THE AIR BUT SHE’S HELD DOWN -- A PLUNGER EXTENDS
FROM THE SIDE OF THE DEVICE -- SOMETHING PUNCTURES INTO HER
SKIN -- All of this underscored by RAPID BREATHING --

AND THE CUTS ABRUPTLY END because in the midst of this pure
unadulterated TERROR the scariest thing about it is the
CRACKLY WHISPER which comes from this unseen SHADOW --

SHADOW
Shhhhhhhhhhhbhh

And off THE HORROR in Claire’s WIDE EYES --

CHARLIE

(to some others)
Hurley -- You two -- come on

Charlie and the others RUSH OFF through one of the cave

FINGERS as Jack puts his arm around Claire -- She’s totally
PANICKED -- HYPERVENTILATING -- Jack in nurture mode --
JACK
C’mon let’s sit down Okay

ETHAN
Sure Yes -- of course

Ethan heads off Claire left just with Jack and Michael --
CAMERA settling down but not completely --

JACK
Okay -- you’re safe Claire Try
to calm down -- We’re here
MICHAEL

CLAIRE JACK
It was dark -- I didn’t see --

-- Where did this happen

CLAIRE
Here -- I was sleeping and woke up
and he was

he was trying to hurt my baby

Unseen to Claire Jack and Michael exchange a LOOK

CLAIRE (CONTD)

He had a -- a thing -- it was -- I

Claire pulls up her shirt -- but her belly is completely
UNMARKED When she talks again it’s softer

CLAIRE (CONTD)
He was trying to hurt my baby
And for the first time we see DOUBT on Jack’s face
EXT THE VALLEY - ENTRANCE - ROCK WALL - MINUTES LATER 14

DOLLY OFF A FIRE revealing in the distance CHARLIE
MICHAEL and some of the others tending to Claire But we
find Jack and Hurley over by one of the TORCHES -- a
conspiratorial conversation between FRIENDS

HURLEY
We hoofed it around the entire
perimeter man

JACK
Nobody saw or heard anything

HURLEY
Uh-uh Everyone was asleep Nada

Jack shakes his head Fuck What the hell is going on here

HURLEY (CONTD)
So I had an idea I’m out there
looking for a psycho with Scott and
Steve right and I’m realizing
who the hell are Scott and Steve

JACK
I’m not following you

HURLEY
If I were a cop and some woman got
attacked we’d canvas right Find
a witness Knock on doors
(beat)
But we don’t have any doors

JACK
None of this is helping me
understand--

HURLEY
We don’t know who’s living here and
who’s still at the beach We don’t
know each other

HURLEY (CONTD)
I’m not telling you -- but what I’m
saying is we need to start finding
out who everyone is here

JACK
You want to start a census

HURLEY

Yeah like a registry Names
What people look like Who’s
related to who We lay down the
law maybe everyone won’t go around
attacking each other I mean --
c’mon -- It feels like someone’s
getting punched or stabbed or
something every other day man

(beat serious)
We gotta find who did this to her

And Jack NODS but there’s more to it -- because that DOUBT
is still etched on his face

15 INT THE VALLEY - CLAIRE’S CUBBY - LATER 15

A little later Charlie drapes a BLANKET over Claires
shoulder She’s still WIRED SCARED

CHARLIE
You all right

She doesn’t say anything -- just offers a small nod

CHARLIE (CONTD)

seems a little distracted --

ARLENE
Catch a falling star put it in
your pocket--

CLAIRE
My father used to sing that to me
Could you sing it for the baby
Every once in a while

ARLENE
Of course

And now things are getting emotional Claire opens the
documents Finds the signature line Puts pen to paper
Signs BUT THERE’S NO INK So Slavitt offers another pen --
she takes it -- tries to sign BUT AGAIN NO INK This is
fuckin’ weird Arlene hands her a pen of her own Claire
takes it -- scribbles on a POST-IT The pen works And she
brings the pen to the page Is about to sign Everyones

watching her -- waiting -- sensing that she’s unable to do
this finally she stands
CLAIRE
I’ve I’m sorry-- I’m-- leaving--
ARLENE

-- you’re what You can’t --
-- but Claire is up and heading out and --

hoping he hasn’t lost his way -- and finally he sees her

Claire up ahead lying there in distress

CHARLIE

He arrives at her side -- drops to his knees out of breath

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Okay okay-- hell be here just

to help lead her --

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Like this Inhale exhale all
that-- do it with me --

And he breathes -- so does she -- and it actually seems to be
helping Still she’s scared in some pain and frustrated
as hell Under her breath and mostly to herself she says

CLAIRE
I’m not supposed to be here

CHARLIE
I think we’ve all been feeling a
bit of that--

CLAIRE
I know there was just someone
who promised me I wouldn’t be here

CHARLIE
He was wrong Keep breathing

CLAIRE
(breathing with regret)
yeah he was wrong

-- and on CLAIRE TIGHT breathing we CUT TO
INT MALKIN’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK 35

Claire stands in the middle of the over-crowded apartment
with Malkin He’s handed her a small manila envelope She
pulls out six-thousand Australian dollars Can’t believe
this Is suspicious and uneasy about it

CLAIRE
Youve spent the last three months
telling me I need to raise the baby
myself Now you’re giving me money
and saying I don’t have to

LOST Raised by Another (BLUE ) 92204 46

(CONTD) 35
MALKIN
I’ve found a couple in Los Angeles
who are very eager to adopt The

baby will be safe in their care
I’ve foreseen

CLAIRE
Foreseen
(starting to lose it)
What am I even doing here I can’t
believe I’m listening to --

And Malkin shakes his head Empathizing REAL

MALKIN
I know it sounds ridiculous
Claire All of this “psychic”

business And I appreciate that

you must think I’m a madman --
(totally genuine)

But this is what must happen

Her reaction she doesn’t believe a word

CLAIRE
So you’re giving me six-thousand
dollars to give my baby to a pair
of strangers in Los Angeles

MALKIN
Twelve-thousand The other six
when you get to Los Angeles And
they’re not strangers -- They’re
good people

CLAIRE
(considers then)
How do you know I won’t just take
the six and run

MALKIN
Because I know your soul I know
your honesty That if you promise
me you’ll go you will

He hands her a PLANE TICKET in a ubiquitous sleeve Off the
CLOSEUP of the ticket and OCEANIC AIRLINES LOGO CUT TO

CHARLIE
A psychic

CLAIRE
I know I’m so embarrassed
(then)
And after everything he was just
full of it

A breathing beat A long one Then

CHARLIE
Or not
(off her look)
All he wanted was that no one else
raise your baby right
(with dread)
so maybe he knew

TIGHT AS HELL on Claire as she turns to Charlie just now
starting to figure out what he means She stares at Charlie

stares horrified by the thought

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I mean if he wanted it bad
enough if that guy really
does have the gift and I think
some people do
(could this be)
he could’ve known Claire

SO TIGHT on Claire -- the very idea ghastly -- and Christ if
she doesn’t suddenly remember details of the moment

INT MALKIN’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK 37
-- in the same moment that he gives her the ticket

CLAIRE
(smiling)
I can’t leave tomorrow I need a
few days to--

MALKIN
No It has to be this flight It
can’t be any other They’re

happen

And Claire heads off walking away from him -- forever --
CLAIRE (VO) (CONTD)

END OF ACT FOUR

LOST Raised by Another (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 92104

ACT FIVE
AND THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING POUNDS US INTO --
EXT JUNGLE - DAY 40

RUNNING LEGS as they JACKHAMMER through masses of PLANTS --
scrabble over ROOTS --

SOMEONE is trying to get through the dense jungle as fast as
they can but a LIMP from an injured leg prevents them from
reaching top speed -- and now we see -- it’s SAYID -- His
clothes weathered from an ordeal (you’1ll read all about it in
EPISODE 108) His face and arms TORN UP from his TWO DAY
TREK He runs smashes his way through the jungle

And if this wasn’t ENOUGH action to get us excited about
staying tuned for the denouement --

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - DAY 4l

ANOTHER PAIR OF LEGS pounds through the foliage running in
the opposite direction -- NO LIMP -- A different RHYTHM to
the BREATHING that accompanies them -- very different
because we pull up and see IT’S HURLEY

By the way this is CUT we get the sense that Sayid and
Hurley -- are RUNNING TO THE SAME PLACE

And off this pure KINETIC INTENSITY we find --

EXT JUNGLE PATH - DAY 42
STILLNESS

Claire sits against a tree CHARLIE huddles at her side with
friendly concern The TRADE WINDS ease around them

prompting the grass to sway with reassuring grace

CHARLIE
You feel another one coming

CLAIRE
I don’t know

CHARLIE
(looking around)
Where in the bloody hell is Jack

Claire shifts starts to get to her feet --

CLAIRE
I think I think I’m all right

CHARLIE
Wait You shouldn’t -- the
contractions --
CLAIRE

Maybe that was the last one

(a half-prayer)
Please let it have been the last
one

CHARLIE
(hopeful)
Jack said the stress might cause
some kind of false labor
(beat)
Are you sure you’re all right

She assesses for a beat then --

CLAIRE
No pain

CHARLIE
Well there you are then
Birthing emergency averted
Told you I’d take care of you

CLAIRE
(a heartbreaking smile)
Thank you Charlie

CHARLIE
you’re quite welcome

And a moment of GENUINE WARMTH Claire finally giving in to
it too After all they’ve been through we want these two
to be together

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Any chance of you making it back to
the caves
(beat and he means this)
I won’t let anything happen to you

And after a moment she NODS But lest we get too
comfortable we CRASH BACK INTO --

KATE

SAYID limps toward them -- And now that he’s made it home

willpower gives way to reality and he COLLAPSES --

-- Jack immediately moves for him eases him to the ground
Kate is close behind Sayid is really fucking WEAK out of
breath -- DISORIENTED -- Trying to get it all out at once --

SAYID
-- Listen -- on the island -- I
found her -- the woman -- she --

rather brutal LEG INJURY

JACK

What happened Where were --

SAYID
I had to come back I had to

clear)

Find LOCKE as he approaches more INTRIGUED than concerned --

Just then HURLEY (the other pair of legs) bursts out of the
brush -- Gasping for breath --

HURLEY
We -- got -- a problem

And HOLY SHIT this is just big-league INSANITY Sayid on the
ground WIPED Jack tending to him Hurley desperately
trying to communicate something himself --

QUICK CUTS covering all of this as (sorry Marita) --

Hurley holds up a METALLIC CLIPBOARD --

everyone who survived All forty-
six of us I interviewed

Got everyone’s -- name

breath)
But one of them -- Jack one of
them isn’t in the manifest

Jack Kate Locke (oh yes we LINGER on Locke) all exchange
a look Even with Sayid’s arrival Hurley’s information has
take on major SIGNIFICANCE

And we PUSH IN on Hurley just so we GET IT when he says --

HURLEY (CONT’D)

And now it’s time to PUSH IN on Kate --

Claire suddenly STOPS -- puts her hand on her belly Charlie
instantly WORRIED --

CHARLIE

Claire SMILES and reaches out taking Charlie’s hand in hers
Charlie smiles abashed as --

ETHAN

a little UNSETTLING

CHARLIE

Ethan Where’s Jack

ETHAN
Oh Jack
(simply)
I didn’t go and get him

Ethan exudes a creepy calm -- he’s still the same guy weve
come to know but there is something slightly askew in his
delivery something just OFF

CHARLIE
What do you mean you didn’t go

Ethan ignores him Turns his attention to Claire takes a
step forward --

ETHAN
I know you’re scared It’s okay

CHARLIE
What the hell are you talking
about you git One more step --

AND SUDDENLY a NOISE in the DENSE JUNGLE behind them --

instant they turn back --

Ethan is standing right in front of them --
