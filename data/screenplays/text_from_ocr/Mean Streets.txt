A darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground A
tree is above him The image is more diffused on the edges
It is black and white and appears to be coming from a
television The body of the man is practically totally in
shadow

ANNOUNCERS VOICE

pictures of death

A small orange fire appears in the breast of the man

INT PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY

Opening TITLES appear over 8mm HOME MOVIES in which
CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family ina
celebrationa sense of one big unending party

During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters
that will later appear in the story JOHNNY BOY MICHAEL
TONY TERESA CHARLIES UNCLE GIOVANNI and others They
are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-
American neighborhood in New York City (WE SENSE from
these HOME MOVIES that the neighborhood forces its people
to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family
Church Friendship) These HOME MOVIES were taken during
some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE
participated

neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as
CHARLIE and the others He runs an illegitimate bar and
dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
in from Maryland He also deals in contraband cigarettes

TITLE APPEARS on bottom of screen MICHAEL
EXT STREET - DAY

A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan Prominent in
the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox
contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood

JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera JOHN

CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old He is an only child
and lives with his mother a divorcee He is clean cut
looking yet slightly radical in dress He was expelled

from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
several months in reform school He is reckless
unambitious nihilistic and was classified a psychiatric 4-
F He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next

door to CHARLIE He has adopted TERESAS family as his own
and spends more time with them than he does with his mother

JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
under his arm and he is smiling He drops the package into
the mailbox and keeps walking But he is moving a little
faster now and smiling a little more

Suddenly the mailbox explodes Dozens of red white and
blue fragments shower down on the street The impact of the
blast knocks JOHNNY down TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame
JOHNNY BOY

He is up in a moment The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he
starts running WE SEE that he is grinning - quite
literally - like crazy

INT CHURCH

WE SEE CHARLIE full face Behind him is a Confessional
Booth The church is very old quiet and dark The CAMERA
ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the
foreground CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and
confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN

CHARLIE
(CONFESSION)
AAs you know Ive just come out

group

of Confession And as a penance
they gave me ten Hail Marys and
ten Our Fathers

THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TRUCK OUT IT MOVES AROUND CHARLIE AND
AWAY FROM THE HOLY CANDLES REVEALING CHARLIES PROFILE

CHARLIE

( )
Now between you and me You
know how I feel about such things
Hail MarysOur FathersNo

imagination

THE CAMERA HAS NOW TRUCKED BEHIND CHARLIE AND WE SEE over
his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the
crucified body of Christ eyes closed reclining in his
sepluchure

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)
If Im going to do penance at
all Ill do it the way I think it
would be doneby me that
isaccording to my own trespasses
You know what I mean

This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time
in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try
very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his
God The images accompanying these monologues are to be of
free association almost documentary in nature

INT TONYS PLACE - NIGHT

The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters
He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool TONY directs
CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group
is now getting boisterously drunk

CHARLIE joins in immediately taking on the mood of the

The rest of the club is filled with many different types of
customers teenagers adults pretending to be teenagers
sailors male and female gays and the boys from the
neighborhood The music is loud and the lights are flashing
but the strippers have not yet appeared
DISSOLVE TO

TONY is at the bar He is approached by GEORGE one of the
bouncers He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and
his friends are creating TONY doesnt take GEORGE very
seriously

GEORGE
Its ten oclock and theyre like
this And theyre just starting

TONY smiles

GEORGE

(CONTINUING)
SmileWhat are you smiling at

TONY

(INTERRUPTING)
Georgedid I ever tell you the
story about the three chickens

GEORGE
(GENUINELY )
No
TONY
Too bad

DISSOLVE TO

CHARLIEs zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs There
is no particular logical sequence except that events are
suited to the rythmic pattern of the music

1 CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the
music

2 CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick He attempts to hit a
filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the
bar He fails

3 CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a strangers
table without moving the glasses or bottles This also
fails

4 A punch is thrown at someone A lit cigarette in the
punchers fist creates a swift arc of light in the
darkness

5 The Strippers finally appear on stage CHARLIE becomes
obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE He shouts to
her tosses things and calls her names She tries half
amusedly to ignore him but she cant

6 TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort and as a
chaser swigs down Aqua Velva

DISSOLVE TO

CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE the
stripper perform again He stares glassy-eyed and then
begins to speak softly continuing his Confession

CHARLIE
Yknowshes really good-looking
really good-looking Ive gotta
say that again Shes really good-
lookingbut shes black You
can see that real plain
(as an afterthought)
When you get down to it though
theres not much of a difference
is there
(He waits for an answer)
Wellis there
(He smiles and begins
chewing on an ice
cube from his half

EMPTY GLASS)

Suddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIEs table
He hands CHARLIE two cartons of cigarettes

CHARLIE
Oh greathey - Winstons

MICHAEL

DISSOLVE TO

JOHNNY BOY enters the night club with two friends He has
been drinking JOHNNY BOYS face shows fresh cuts and
bruises His friends approach the hat check girl and give
her their coats JOHNNY BOY approaches her giving her his
pants instead His friends laugh hysterically

CHARLIE is now alone at the end of the bar JOHNNY BOY now
completely dressed enters the bar area CHARLIE watches
JOHNNY BOY approaching and continues his Confession JOHNNY

BOY greets people as he passes them

and as CHARLIE speaks

he appears to be moving in slow motion

CHARLIE
What do you think If a man have
a hundred sheep and one of them
stray will he not leave the
ninety-nine in the mountains and
go in search of the one that has
strayed And if he happen to find
it amen I say to you he rejoices
over it more than over the ninety-
nine that did not go astray Even
so it is not the will of your
Father in Heaven that a single one
of these little ones should
perish Ok thats very nce but

TONY is now behind the bar near CHARLIE JOHNNY BOY has
reached them

JOHNNY BOY

car and quickly opens the door

EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
JOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp-
post He has seriously banged his head and blood is running
down his face But because of the near proximity of the
police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of
dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES TERESA is going through the various
stages of getting dressed
TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years well built attractive and
intelligent She is well read and quiet The salary she
makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
supports her family She has epilepsy which has prevented
her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
relationships with men She has however been having an
affair with CHARLIE for the past year It is a well kept
secret from both families because the families regard each
other as blood relations

CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has
begun to dial the telephone

was a common occurance CHARLIE turns back to look at

TERESA but she is no longer in her room

CHARLIE

checks his complexion The mirror image begins to speak

The image of CHARLIE in the bathroom intercuts with stills
from Catholic School text books - vulgar color illustrations
of parables - emphasis on Christ expelling the devils from
the posessed women

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)
But Im not like the Pharisee who
said Oh God I thank thee that I am

INT RESTAURANT - MID-DAY

CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant
This restaurant was considered an above average business
with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
three years ago The quality has diminished but the prices
remain the same As a result the place is dying CHARLIE

is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner He picks up
a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on

He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass She
apologizes cleans it with her apron and places it back on
the table He takes a menu

A chubby middle-aged man OSCAR approaches the table He
is half owner of the decaying restaurant He is in his
shirt sleeves which along with the side of his face are
smeared with grease and dirt He is tired and disgusted

OSCAR
(with a slight Jewish accent)
Heyyoure here They told me

CHARLIE
Ok hows everything going

OSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE

EXT STREET - DAY
CHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side

A noisy religious street festival is being held on the
block
INT SMALL ITALIAN CAFE - DAY

CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to
some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
room This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house candy
store luncheonette and meeting place for CHARLIES uncle
GIOVANNI and his associates

GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty He is well respected and
powerful both in and out of the neighborhood He became a
head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
custom but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
organization GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype
of an old Mafioso rather a kindly and intelligent old man

GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian

A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in
the corner of the room in the luncheonette area

CHARLIE
(to repair man)
Is my uncle back there

CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway

REPAIR MAN
Yeah but I think hes busy now
Hey Charlie play 463 today - for
sure

CHARLIE
Thanks

CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area past the dining
room where his uncle is in conference to the bathroom at
the very back of the cafe MARIO is seated with his uncle

MARIO is forty five years old He is GIOVANNIS closest
associate brought into the organization in the traditional
manner making his early reputation through hits (murders)
He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
GIOVANNI and is very fond of CHARLIE

MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man They are
deep in their private conversation CHARLIE passes by

unnoticed and walks into the bathroom

CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind He
shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
conversation

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

GIOVANNI and MARIO are calmly sipping their coffee as they
listen to the old mans nervous talk

OLD MAN
(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)
What Im telling you is that he did
it for Marios honor

MARIO
But you dont understand I knew
the kid He was drunk He made of
fool of himselfnot me

OLD MAN
(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)
Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an
insult to you

MARIO
There was no insult

OLD MAN
(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)
The boy only did what was right

GIOVANNI
Your son only did what was stupid
We have enough down here without
something like that And what for
-Nothingno reason Protect
him Why I didnt tell him to do
anything for me Hes going to
Miami Goodkeep him in Miami
for six monthsa yeara good
long time After everythings
forgotten then I see what I can do
for him Right nowkeep him away

INT LUNCHEONETTE AREA - DAY

CHARLIE is seated at a table The waitress MARIE
approaches and gives him his cup of coffee The following
scene is reminiscent of a TELEVISION COMMERCIAL

CHARLIE
Marie are there Columbian coffee
beans in this coffee

MARIE
I dunno

CHARLIE
Just a second Let me taste it

He pauses to sip the coffee then shakes his head

CHARLIE
Yes Id say there are some
Columbian coffee beans in this
coffee but only about 39

MARIE is disinterested CHARLIE continues

CHARLIE
You see You probably dont notice
this Marie but Colombian coffee
beans are rich coffee beans
Bursting with that good deep
coffee flavor Picked when they
are ripe to the point of perfection
The beans of course are protected
by the tall South American Guama
trees

MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table
CHARLIES monologue continues and gradually he falls back
into his CONFESSION As he talks the CAMERA PICKS UP
DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it

CHARLIE
Then the bean pickers come down and
pick each bean by hand Bean by
bean all heavy with flavor And
they load them into boxes one box
at a time box by box

From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who
is busy with her work

BLACK and WHITE and COLOR
The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS

aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS

stores people streets buildings in short a concise

vision of the neighborhood All this is intercut with

CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIEs clothes off with his
eyes

CHARLIE

( )
Like looking at my uncle back
there One way is the obvious
Man outside the law On the
other hand instead of a breakdown
of order there is a creation of
order and instead of the breakdown
of law there is the creation of
lawIn this society which needs
new law because Whats a crowbar
compared to a share of stock
Whats the robbing of a bank
compared to the founding of one and
whats the murder of a man to the
gainful employment of that man
Do not think that I have come to
destroy the Law or the Prophets I
have not come to destroy but to
fulfill Amen

The image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York
City (STOCK FOOTAGE)

CHARLIE now sees MARIE totally naked as she serves the
customers

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring
at it It looks deserted

comes out of the bathroom and passes by He takes the photo
from MICHAEL Group attention focuses on TONY now He
stares at the picture holds it away from him then closer
to his face then sideways and finally upside-down

TERESA
Oh sure I know her MichaelIn
fact I saw her a few days ago
under a bridge in Jersey making
out with a nigger

MICHAEL grimaces in shock He spits

MICHAEL
You surea niggerUhand I
kissed her

He wipes his lips with his cape

The guest of honor the young soldier is very drunk He is
attempting to open his going away presents one of which
turns out to be a carefully folded American flag He
attempts to open it with one great flourish He fails
however knocking over the glasses on the table The group
applauds

water

Suddenly the doorbell rings and everyone looks up The

door opens and CHARLIE appears arms outstretched dressed
as the ressurected Christ - with white robes fake beard and
hair and artificial wounds His arms stretch out wider

The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him

TONY
(SMILING)
Hallelujah

CHARLIE enters in mock holiness

CHARLIE
I have come to create order
Scotch and water please

They all laugh The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to
and fro blessing all in the room TONY is delighted with

the scene CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table TONY opposite
him and the others gather around The party is getting
noisier TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes CHARLIE
plays the part of a priest during the Mass when the chalice
is filled with wine and water TONY pours the scotch over
his fingers first

CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
would He signifies that there is enough in the glass
TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-

CHARLIE
May God be with you

TONY
And with your spirit

CHARLIE
(gesturing with his drink)
Salute

Everyone drinks after repeating the toast The crowd around
them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have
fun with each other TONY pulls down his mask revealing a
skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his
mouth It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well

TONY
(taking on the guise
of an interviewer)
Art thou the King of the Jews
CHARLIE
Dost thou say this of thyself or
have others told thee of me

TONY
Am I a Jew Thy own people and
the chief priests have delivered
thee to me What hast thou done

MICHAEL and a few of the others gather around again as they
continue

CHARLIE
My kingdom is not of this world
If my kingdom were of this world my
followers would have fought that I
might not be delivered to the Jews
But as it is my kingdom is not
from here

TONY
Thou art then a king

CHARLIE
Thou sayest it I ama king This
is why I was born and why I have
come into this world to bear
witness to the truth Everyone who
is of the truth hears my voice

TONY leans over towards CHARLIE

TONY
‘What is the truth

The others around them give mock applause TONY smiles and
nods his head to them CHARLIE laughs They drink Someone
hits CHARLIE on the back of the head CHARLIE startled

looks up

TONY
Prophesy to us oh Christ Who is
it that struck thee

CHARLIE
I dont know but God help him if
he does it again
They all laugh
INT SAME APARTMENT - NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

CHARLIE is talking to MICHAEL The conversation is serious
CHARLIE has not lost his sense of humor

CHARLIE
He said hed be here

MICHAEL
Well he isnt Nicereal nice

CHARLIE
Hell be here Look take this for

He hands MICHAEL a twenty dollar bill from under his robe

MICHAEL
You kiddin The way it is now this
isnt even interest for two hours

CHARLIE
(putting the bill
back into his pocket)
How much was the original loan again

MICHAEL
500 He borrowed that because he
wanted to pay off his other loans
now counting the interestits
almost 3000

CHARLIE
3000 Shit Can we hold it at
3000

MICHAEL

Charlie this is business

CHARLIE
(avoiding the issue)
But I say to you love your
enemies do good to those who hate
you and pray for those who
persecute

MICHAEL
Ill tell you who you can pray
for Next payday Ill be at
Tonys PlaceJohnny better show
or I find him and break his
legsand I mean it

CHARLIE
(in the same manner)
But I say to you not to resist the
evildoer on the contrary if
someone takes thy tunic let him
take thy cloak as wellto him who
asks of thee give and from him
who would borrow of thee do not
turn away

MICHAEL

(EXASPERATED)
He could at least show some respect
and show his face even if he
doesnt have the money

CHARLIE
(more serious now)
Amen I say to thee thou wilt not
come out from it until thou hast
paid the last penny

MICHAEL
You said it

A loud scream is heard from the bathroom
CUT TO
APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now
filled with congealed red jello The boys are laughing and
shoving each other about roughly CHARLIE comes out of the
next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through
the madness his arms outstretched One boy kneels and
kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him There
is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the
bathroom and near the doorway CHARLIE promises to save the
sinner as he pushes his way through He helps the girl
remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the
bathtub It is obvious that she is quite stoned She
caresses him and they find themselves kissing The others
storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE

EVERYONE
BlasphemyThe anti-Christ
Crucify him

They drag CHARLIE into the next room where amidst all the
shouting and laughing the other members of the party are
placing firecrackers on model airplanes simulating their
own dog fight They are flying the planes out the open
window

CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few
lines over their laughter

CHARLIE
Fatherforgive themfor they
know notwhat they do

The doorbell rings and TONY answers it It is TERESA and
she looks very worried

TERESA

the effect of being a bulky overcoat

hour now

CHARLIE
Now dont get excited Dont get

It is very late and the streets are deserted At the corner
of the building in question a few of JOHNNY BOYS friends
cling to the wall for safety When they see CHARLIE and
TERESA they call out
FRIENDS

TERESA gets up against a wall CHARLIE sends her down the
block and she leaves reluctantly

CHARLIE
Johnny its me Charlie

JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight
on the tenement roof He has a gun in his hand

JOHNNY BOY
Dont come any closer

CHARLIE
Cut it out stupid Its me

JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air CHARLIE clings to the
wall with the others A moment later he makes a quick run
for the doorway of the building across the street He
enters the building that leads to the roof

JOHNNY BOY

He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass
cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick
through the top layer of cork He lights it

CHARLIE
What the fuck

JOHNNY BOY tosses it over the building and it blows up in
mid-air The boys below rush madly away Lights go on in
the tenements around them The explosion was quite loud

CHARLIE

EXT CEMETARY - NIGHT

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are sneaking over a fence in an old
cemetary which is part of their neighborhood It surrounds
their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th

JOHNNY BOY
I understand

JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and
then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight It seems
totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
the distance

CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes preparing to take
them off He projects the image of Christ delivering a
sermon Music and laughter in the distance catches his
attention The lights and the music are coming from the top
floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
having a party The sound echoes through the streets
Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
windows As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
the girls Screams are heard People run up and down the
fire escape

CHARLIE has pulled off the robe He now removes the beard
and wig and has become himself again He leans over to find
JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb
CHARLIE
Could you not then watch one
hour with me
He wakes JOHNNY BOY up
CHARLIE
The spirit is willing but the

flesh is weak

fascinated with the flames on the grill They remind him of
an old device from his Catholic School days CHARLIE brings
his hand forward and closer to the fire testing the pain of
the Fires of Hell

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)
If thy hand is an occasion of sin
to thee cut it off It is better
for thee to enter into life maimed
than having two hands to go into
hell into the unquenchable fire
‘Where their worm dies not and the
fire is not quenched

planes to and from every part of the world On the flight
board the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
and change every moment He passes the insurance machines
and almost stops - more upset than before A businessman
calmly pays for insurance (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE

and St Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
dogs and flight bags He looks at the cross

and stands staring at the board He sees the names of

dozens of cities flashing before him As he watches a

pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk

He apparently does not hear her
