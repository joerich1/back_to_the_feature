Some of them want to use you

Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused

- Eurythmics

Some years from this exact moment

INT TRAIN - DAY

DARKNESS - NOW

The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
COSMOS DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face

They could be stars at lightspeed or SUBWAY LIGHTS
FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE SULLEN FACES riding
into a bleak future and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER Its
dark claustrophobic obscure the rhythmic beat of track
and wheel-clicks engulf us The lights flicker back on and
hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO steel-
eyed prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL

ZERO IN on TWO
KABLE 30-something roughneck focused determined eyes
burning with internalized emotion

and SANDRA late 20s undeniably hot but tough as hell -
both are in shackles and cuffs being roughly transported
through underground tunnels knocked and shoved around
Uniformed GUARDS roam the train looking pissed off - their
swagger seems to mask FEAR

KABLE is meditating or exhausted - hard to tell The GIRL
makes eye contact w him

SANDRA
Sandra

KABLE says nothing just stares at her stoic

SANDRA (contd)
My name is Sandra

GUARD
Shut the fuck up

Because he can the GUARD takes a swing at KABLES head with
a BILLY CLUB CRACK

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

KABLES skull snaps back into the window The GUARD swings
again this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach

SANDRA
(to the GUARD a snarl)
Putcher dick away

GUARD
Get some

CRACKK CRACK CRACKK CRACK SANDRA is buckled
over awkwardly hands behind her back tethered to the seat
head dripping blood KABLE jerks against his restraints
every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART
He uses his elbow to help her back up but SANDRA fights
through it sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
herself

The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA KABLE lets a
glob of blood dangle from his mouth biting his lip bearing
it we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
others and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
growing louder POUNDING slamming into our brains blotting
out all thought until
2 INT TUNNEL 1 - DAY

POV we are RUNNING ragged full sprint down a TUNNEL
towards dirty white DAYLIGHT
NO MUSIC - just heavy breath KABLES HEARTBEAT and the sound
of his boots bouncing off the concrete
Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons at the
tunnels end vaguely defined shapes of buildings smoke
sky
Our POV WHITES OUT as we

3 EXT SPAWN POINT 1 - CONTINUOUS

smash into the DAYLIGHT

Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish KABLE climbs over
burning debris gun raised as SANDRA and the other soldiers
disappear into the grey mist

4 EXT SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1

KABLE emerges from the smoke into

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007
4
a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY DETROIT NY Seemingly out

of character he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
OVERDRAMATIC ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails Coachella
2005)
In sequence multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
somewhere below human hearing The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin
then snap into place GO TIME

5 OTHER SPAWN POINTS
oO) OV

Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
INTO THE LIGHT They crouch and spread out

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1

What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - ata
closer look they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
hummingbirds magnetically controlled The swarm splits

apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIERS head

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1 - COVER

KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
COVER The sound of trains weapons soldiers all fade
away until

NOTHING DEAD QUIET

SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLEs face - a pause - THEN
we hear a GUNSHOT

Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
after the bullets pass we hear the GUNSHOTS See the
lightning wait for the thunder

In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
behind an old car to a brick staircase Then another BLUE
runs the opposite way closer in the foreground BROWNS VS
BLUES The SILENCE is crawling deafening and then

BOOM

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN
KABLES eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
into the mist

THOOM THOOM The shells puncture air and connect
distantly

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

The air ripples all around him his world closing in he
breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
fire

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1 - OPEN STREET

A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street totally
IGNORING THE VIOLENCE KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley A BUM
holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it

From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN and BLUE
combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS In the top right corner
of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE somewhat
transparent watching the battle tungsten red (similar to
your own reflection on a TV)

We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE
KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the

third floor window - and then coming from the REAR SURROUND
SPEAKERS behind us

A VOICE - almost a whisper too clean and distinct to be
outdoors in this environment and TOO YOUNG to possibly
belong to KABLE

VOICE (0S)
(clean disconnected)
Eat shit please

THWIPPP The BLUE drops like a sack KABLE perfectly cuts
back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front
Inside a CLERK air bags groceries for an empty store

A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
bunker a hundred yards north The distant BLUE targets seem
almost robotically unaware The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
left hand on the ground for stability right hand twisting
the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger TAT TAT TAT TAT
TAT TAT TATATATATATATATATA TAT The BLUES fall some
clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
ground dead

Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
him Uh oh

BOOOOOSH The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
knees up the FOREARM that supported him is standing
straight up cleanly severed at the elbow It slowly wobbles
over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees
© ©

oO

The THREE LIMBS fall into each other forming a flesh and
bone TRIPOD

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

VROOOOOOSH CHUKUNK CHUKUNK A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH
THE DESTRUCTION pushing the bodies and debris out of the way
and clearing a path one streaked with crimson red and burnt
flesh It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1 - STREET

Down the road KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
truck As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE the EAST-INDIAN
WOMAN gets right back up walking into and getting
obliterated by another TRUCK Its creepy - robotic but
violent and too real - like a programmed suicide

VOICE (0S)
Cant say I didnt try

We sense emotion in KABLES cold eyes - then they flicker to
the peripheral

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING

Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
aim we SNAP ZOOM in

SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE

The transparent GHOST OF A FACE as though projected on
glass The LIPS MOVE in sync with

VOICE (0S)
Shit Shit

KABLE spins TOO LATE -
BUT from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an

open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
THROUGH THE CEILING The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS
11 SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND 1 - STREET

The BROWN runs out and hits the curb CONCRETE AND MEAT
collapse on the spot where she stood its SANDRA
KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way They
bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first He stops
to let SANDRA catch up and in that instant -
HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O Blood and particles
splatter
over KABLEs gear
VOICE (0S)
Suckage

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES

Up ahead HE SEES IT an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small
GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS He makes for it

The little FLY following him is picked out of the air bya
stray shot - PLINK

VOICE (OS) (contd)
what the

Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE but hes
QUICK

A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD almost knocking him off his
feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE
BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH

He scrambles to the octagons entrance and BAILS IN

12 INT SAVE POINT 1

KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room The
second he breaks the GREEN LASER FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all
around the BATTLEFIELD A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from
loudspeakers everywhere echoing through the streets CYCLING
DOWN

The battle is over - session complete

13 EXT SAVE POINT 1

KABLE steps out The LEDS on his weapon blink off in
sequence

ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE rounding up the I-Cons

I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row
inmateslifers of which there are never a shortage

GENERI-CONs (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that
lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield they
are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters) petty
thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by
participating to commute their sentences

A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE His
eyes are pure MURDER SANDRAS brain matter still drips from
him

HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON POINTS IT AT A GUARDS HEAD AND PULLS
THE TRIGGER -

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

NOTHING The GUARD doesnt even flinch The WEAPON is DEAD
dormant they all knew it
The GUARDS have a good LAUGH KABLE is CLUBBED from behind -
we
FADE TO
BLACK

14 INT TRAIN - LATER

Back on the rattling TRAIN where we started The SURVIVING
SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail -
wounded exhausted hollow eyed

BLUE SOLDIER 1
Good run Kable

KABLE only looks to the floor

KABLE
(quietly)
My names Tillman

BROWN SOLDIER 1
Whatever your name is You got to
the save point fast

BROWN SOLDIER 2
So the fuck what No ones getting
out of here alive

BLUE SOLDIER 1
I am Im going to make it

The cynical BROWN just shakes his head

BROWN SOLDIER 2
Sure you will

BLUE SOLDIER 1
(tuning the BROWN out
turning his attention to
KABLE)

They say you only got three battles
left til you get out

KABLE says nothing

The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm a simple
outline of a black box with the words inside I AM RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU

(MUSIC Aldo Nova LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY kicks in

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007
15 INT LAB - TIME INDETERMINATE

A spartan underground LAB

A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE
on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH In front of
him floating in the air is one of the little metallic
FLIES

He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left again - it jukes
right almost faster than the eye can follow No way he
could ever touch it

Semi-satisfied he holds out the metal dish and clicks the
remote The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK

CLOSE-UP the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one
side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air
There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end

The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the
lens up to his eyes Switch to

HOW DOES IT WORK

INT TELNET - INTERVIEW STUDIO LIVE

THROW TO the LIVE STUDIO BROADCAST -

GINA PARKER SMITH
(leaning in)
Mr Castle - how the hell does it
work

KEN CASTLE
Simple

A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the
VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIERS head - and
then INSIDE passing thru transparent layers

KEN CASTLE (contd)
It begins with a single nano-cell
planted in the motor cortex of the
brain -- this cell can replicate
replacing the cells ‘round it with
perfect copies

We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a
bold block letter N The nano-cell approaches a normal cel
next to it there is a flash now the cell next to it has
turned into an exact copy of the nano This continues
multiplying exponentially until we zoom back to reveal tha
the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells

KEN CASTLE (contd)
these copied cells contain
remote access functionality
Therefore nano plus cortex equals
the nanex

The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands
working a retro ATARI-style joystick animated waves
indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the
Slayer who unfreezes and flies into action

EXT PRISON YARD - DAY

A PRISONER - shirtless his upper body smeared with WHITE
POWDER screaming SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE Blood
sprays on white

We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD The GUARD
wears a black gas mask shattered and pouring blood Other
prisoners shackled together stand by watching forming a
half circle around the fight They are shirtless covered in
the same white powder - they look like tribesmen

One of the prisoners very distinctive nods grimly clearly
enjoying the show
DISTINCTIVE PRISONER
Fuck him up
The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could bea
chalk mine or the surface of a strange planet Distant
towers mark the perimeter

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the
distance trotting along in lines Trails of thick magenta
smoke snake across the yard sucked by the wind

The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARDS face one last
time - his shoes are made of cloth CRUNCH The GUARD stops
moving

The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain
A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners

They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
to the fleeing ROGUE they merely watch him go impassive

In a moment we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses
between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by
an invisible field Sound Light Magnetism His body

goes into spasms blood foams from his ears mouth eyes

out of the white terrain He sits by himself wearing a white
cloth hoodie eyes dark head down silent Across the yard
a group of prisoners are playing basketball EVERY SINGLE

strings - Twisting your mind and
smashing your dreams

KABLE is alone in his cell

At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to
push food through - it opens But instead of a tray someone
pushes through a wrinkled photograph

KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN just a blur of golden
hair laughing and a LITTLE GIRL the same one in KABLES
vision

WOMAN (0S)
You want to get back to them

KABLE is stunned silent He sits on the ground shoulder
leaning against the heavy door staring at the girl in the
picture

WOMAN (OS) (contd)
Its all you think about Its the
only thing that keeps you alive

Her words are like hammer blows to his guts he wants to weep
but hes too strong too internalized He steels himself

KABLE
Whos talking
She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN

WOMAN (0S)

This takes KABLE by surprise he reluctantly takes the pen
and card He writes something on it and sticks it back
through the slider

PFFHHT The WOMAN stabs KABLES hand with a LANCET - she
draws out a little blood

KABLE yanks his hand back out

WOMAN (0OS) (contd)
Need to prove its authentic
Makes it worth more

KABLE
Why would anyone want my name

WOMAN (0S)
You dont even know whats going on

At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then
the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel

WOMAN (0S) (contd)
Gotta go

KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a
lifeline is slipping away

KABLE
Wait
(he holds the wrinkled
photo to the window)
How did you get this picture Have
you seen them

He peers through the little window at the top of the door
but shes GONE

Instead a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor
to their NEW CELLS We recognize grim battered faces from
the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was
being beaten down

through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a

vast cold mansion

SIMONS ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING each one a

prominence in the 3-D space muted VID CHATS STOCK

Everything dynamic everything moving

One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND with updated statistics POINTS
LEADER FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these
categories a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name
illustrates the point

In the FOREFRONT of SIMONS attention
KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS

A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series
of revolving images - WEAPONS EQUIPMENT BODY ARMOR

SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES -
he can SLIDE SQUEEZE PULL AND SCROLL the images just by

moving his fingers in the air

He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS

HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN knocking the WEAPON out of KABLES
hand it skitters across the concrete
SIMON is completely freaked - its happening too fast no
time to react he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every
move pings a step late

KABLE swings a fist HACKMAN dodges easily HACKMAN is
moving too naturally - as if hes under his own control

HACKMAN slams the pipe off the side of KABLES head DROPPING

HIM - then tosses the pipe away and pulls out a nasty
high tech-looking SHOTGUN He stands over KABLE and points
the barrel at his FACE

144 INT MILITARY FACILITY DEBRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SCOTCH chuckles conspiratorial

SCOTCH

KABLES sorry seems to refer to something only KABLE knows

SCOTCH
(hesitant making light)
Well its not like you ever looked

A BEAT SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE

KABLES eyes flicker away from SCOTCHS He calmly removes
his military issue 45 from its holster and lets it rest on

the table between them He stares at it intensely

starting to seep through the icy lines of his face

SCOTCH (contd)
(quietly)
Tillman what did they do to you

and spasm in the chair

INT MILITARY FACILITY DEBRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
KABLE starts to shake the gun rattles on the table top A
bead of sweat creeps down his forehead Its apparent that
he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007
146

A low hum in the room starts to swell and throb numbing
disorienting
SCOTCH
(freaked)
Tillman
It seems to take all of KABLES strength to answer
His
voice is halting human - not robotic like before
KABLE

KABLES eyes meet SCOTCHS they are red rimmed with tears
SCOTCH
Who are you
CUT TO

HUMANZ BROTHER
A test
Everyones eyes had been glued to it - now they look up
through the OBSERVATION WINDOW
The room is empty The CHAIR is knocked over on the floor

KABLE is gone
150 INT HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

KABLE is slumped against concrete on his knees RELIVING

THE MURDER has knocked the hell out of him but hes DEALING
WITH IT

A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him ANGIE

He touches her face looks deep into her EYES - they are wet
with emotion

KABLE
Its you

She just NODS They embrace finally for real

ANGIE
I missed you so much

KABLE
(softly)
Delia
ANGIE says nothing just holds him tighter KABLE pushes her
hair back - he searches her eyes desperate with emotion
KABLE (contd)

TRACE (0C)
Nobody could

KABLE turns to FACE HER

TRACE (contd)
Your daughter was taken into foster
care by the state two years ago

KABLE tries to understand

TRACE (contd)

The foster parent paid good money
to remain anonymous to make sure
the girl would be untraceable But
theres always a data trail if you
know where to look

KABLE is gathering himself focusing a FURY building

KABLE

KABLE slams through CROWDS - hes on a mission The ALLEY
leading to the UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS is right around the
corner

GINA PARKER SMITH
Tillman

GINA fights to catch up to him She gets a hand on his
shoulder he SPINS

GINA PARKER SMITH (contd)
(out of breath)
Wait I want to come with you
KABLES eyes leave no room for doubt not a chance

KABLE
Thats all the story youre going
to get

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

He BAILS leaving her there

JUST THEN matching BLACK SUVs pull up to the curb just TEN
FEET from where she stands

CASTLES GEEK SQUAD piles out GINA sees them recognizes
them from the interview with CASTLE she TURNS AWAY just in
time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the
crowd

But theyre not after her they head straight for the
ALLEY

CUT TO

INT CELL - TIME INDETERMINATE

BLACK A door opens a switch is thrown and SIMON is
blinded by harsh fluorescent light He sits up on a cot
wearing a white T-shirt and pajama pants fucked up hair
groggy He BELCHES

AGENT KEITH (0C)
Alright Silverton Get up and get
out

SIMON

AGENT KEITH
(sarcastic)

CUT TO

INT SIMONS ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE

SIMON slides open the door to his room peaks inside
hesitantly
Its TRASHED The FLOOR is littered with busted up
electronics and garbage The wall-sized screens are all
running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD repeated in columns
by the thousands - scrolling fast a digital waterfall of
words white on black
CHEATER
Its over
SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus in a state of
mild SHOCK - hes LOST EVERYTHING

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007
153

He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING
LOOP then once again attempting to activate SLAYERS
control the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we
last saw on GORGES screen
FEMALE VOICE
No link no link
SIMON slumps against the wall DEFEATED
FADE TO
BLACK
154 EXT CASTLE ESTATE - NIGHT

CASTLES ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY
Balconies underlit DOMES lush landscaping abstract
statues waterfalls tiny cameras everywhere and not a
soul in sight
KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass Wind in

the leaves
cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE

He keeps to the trees making his way toward the central
MANSION

THEN the sound of DOGS they come in a PACK loping across
the lawn - grey more like WOLVES

KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run
RIGHT PAST HIM They round a corner and DISAPPEAR Weird

KABLE looks up spots a CAMERA and another and another
stands to reason hes been MARKED already

He walks out INTO THE OPEN

155 INT CASTLES MANSION - NIGHT

The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN
KABLE walks
right in
The interior is HUGE and EMPTY NO FURNITURE no art no
people of course Could anyone possibly live here
He explores
156 INT CASTLES MANSION - EMPTY HALL - NIGHT

AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large empty HALL
A LITTLE GIRL 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself
playing with DOLLS making them walk and talk

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007
156

KABLES eyes go wide He starts to walk toward her
slowly
at first

KABLE
Delia

and finally breaking into a run - until

He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL crumpling
to the ground The GIRL doesnt react KABLE pounds on the
glass

KABLE (contd)
DELIA

then looks closer running his fingers across the SMOOTH
SURFACE

KEN CASTLE (0S)
Not bad for video eh

The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS it seems to be
everywhere at once intimate

KEN CASTLE (0S) (contd)
The latest and greatest defy you
to tell it from real life You
imagine porn on this thing

KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself Hes
playing CASTLES GAME and the RULES are still UNDEFINED

Then - MUSIC The SOUND of a SWINGIN HI-HAT from down a long
corridor -

t - t - tssss t - t - tssss t - t - tsss

KABLE walks toward the source a bass and piano pick up the
groove

INT CASTLES MANSION BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

He comes to a BALLROOM - empty like everything else shiny
hardwood floor for DANCING

A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above illuminating KEN CASTLE
Hes wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS Every instinct tells KABLE
to go after him - but he holds back Who knows if its even
real And then CASTLE starts to SING

or more precisely LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA Ive
Got You Under My Skin CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE

Ive got you under my skin

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

Ive got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that youre really a part of me
Ive got you under my skin

Hes snapping his fingers putting on the moves THEN -
from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear We
RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison
the game the pursuit only instead of BLUE they are
wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES

KABLE grips his weapon but the men are UNARMED instead
they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE
behind CASTLE

Id sacrifice anything come what might

For the sake of having you near

In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear

KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the
room glasses beards pony tails - silently the GEEK
SQUAD has moved in and taken position They move their hands
in rhythm synchronized each one seems to control a
DANCER they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS kick
with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a
ROCKETTE

Suddenly ON A MUSICAL HIT everyone - CASTLE the GEEKS the
SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall where a VIDEO
SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD
busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING
EVERYONE ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away

Dont you know little fool you never can win

Use your mentality wake up to reality

But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
before I give in

Cause Ive got you under my skin

KABLE hits his breaking point He brings up his WEAPON to
open up on the SLAYERS CLICK Its DEAD The GEEKS have
taken care of that

KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE but the SLAYERS

break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM turns out
theyre flesh and blood after all

CASTLE backs away whistling the melody and continues his
SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand
combat breaking necks snapping arms smashing faces
its a full-on BALLET OF DEATH finally THE MUSIC ENDS
right on cue KABLE is finishing off the last of the men
blood on his hands

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

CASTLE applauds the GEEKS follow suit
KEN CASTLE
(genuinely stoked)
Youre awesome
KABLE
Castle
KEN CASTLE
Kable
They speak simultaneously
KABLE KEN CASTLE
I dont care about you You dont care about me

KEN CASTLE (contd)
you just want your little sugar
pie I know So dont do anything
stupido My house my rules

CASTLE walks away leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly
without concern toward a side door

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Come on I want to show you

something

INT CASTLES MANSION HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Tracking along the hallway MEDIUM CLOSE profile
CASTLE walks along confidently KABLE following The
background is a black glittering STARSCAPE

KEN CASTLE
ve got to thank you for leading
me to them by the by - the human-
zuzz that is

Snap out WIDE the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF
THE MOON - another 3-D projection no doubt CRATERS and
LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon The GEEK SQUAD walks
along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance they are all
tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama the PLANET EARTH
rising majestically in the dark heavens

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Of course soon enough theyd be
whistling my tune like everybody
else but meantime it was that
little cracker program they dreamed
up that got my attention

(MORE)

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

KEN CASTLE (contd)
that was a genuine nuisance no
doubt about it One thing even
they didnt know though Im wired
too
SNAP back to CASTLE MEDIUM CLOSE His eyes are
FUCKING
CRAZY
KEN CASTLE (contd)
I replaced 98 of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago
159 INT CASTLES COURT - CONTINUOUS

They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor NBA
regulation BASKETBALL COURT electronic scoreboard
bleachers the whole nine Its dark moody - only one bank
of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on
At the FAR END of the COURT HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS shooting
baskets ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in
a FLEX BRACE

The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS

KEN CASTLE

But mines different

(taps his FOREHEAD)
Built to send - to transmit
Whereas every other K-soft cell out
there - including the ones in

(taps KABLES forehead )
your head Kable - is designed to
receive I think it you do it

CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN nods toward him
HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Were talking every Slayer
everyone in Society City I
believe your better half would fall
under that category provided
theyre within range of my
transmitters

CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN HACKMAN stops dancing jogs over
picks up the ball and resumes shooting

KABLE
(sarcastic)
Very nice Castle So youve got an
army of psychotics and deviants to
dance around for you

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

CASTLE narrows his eyes amusement edging out irritation he
walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER

KEN CASTLE
Youre thinking small Kable But
not as small as me
He sinks his hands into the POWDER brings them out and
CLAPS making WHITE DUST CLOUDS KABLE waves the dust AWAY
FROM HIS FACE

KEN CASTLE (contd)
See nano cells are real small a
thousand times smaller than even
these dust particulates
(KABLE coughs)
Inhale it and they go to work

replicating spreading like a
virus multiplying in
exponentials six months time I

could have 100 million people
converted - ditch diggers porn
stars presidents - and not one
would be the wiser

Behind KABLE HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently
TURNS TOWARD US

KEN CASTLE (contd)
A hundred million folks that will
buy what I want them to buy vote
how I want them to vote do pretty
much damn well anything I figure
they ought to do

HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind eyes burning at
a full charge running into FOCUS holding the BOWIE
KNIFE

KEN CASTLE (contd)
For instance

KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second spins and ABSORBS THE
TACKLE The men GO TO THE GROUND grappling UFC-style

KABLE has HACKMANS KNIFE HAND by the wrist stopping it -
but leaving his face UNPROTECTED

HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLES face
connecting and opening a CUT under his eye then AGAIN - this
time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and
WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS dislocating HACKMANS shoulder with
a sickening POP

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

KABLE works around HACKMAN gets him in a HEADLOCK and
SQUEEZES still gripping the knife hand immobilizing it
HACKMAN is choking BEAT RED for long brutal seconds the
life drains out of him finally HACKMANS eyes roll back
he GOES LIMP KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMANS
dead fingers

He struggles to his feet dripping sweat and blood

KABLE
You shouldve let him fight for
himself Castle - he mightve had a
shot

KEN CASTLE
(pleasant)
I think youre missing the point
my man

KABLE
No I get it - youre pulling the
strings on all of this
(starts to move toward
CASTLE with BAD INTENT)
which makes my next move pretty
easy to figure

KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST bringing the KNIFE around to open
his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER

His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR the BLADE inches from contact

KEN CASTLE
Neglected to mention my smart boys
reversed that hack those fellas
worked for you - easy breezy once
we had access to their drives

This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom he
feels his will ripped away from him HES BEING PUPPETED BY
THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Youre mine boy

With a twitch of CASTLES eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down
and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG
CUT TO

160 INT SIMONS ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

SIMON
Ummm
CUT BACK
TO

161 INT CASTLES COURT - CONTINUOUS

CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the
jaw then a haymaker to the GUT doubling KABLE over

He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he
backs away

KEN CASTLE
Biggest baddest Slayer in the
game dont seem like much does

he

CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself He uppercuts
KABLE snapping his head back then shakes out his
knuckles

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Oww
KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it
perfectly KABLES nails rake across CASTLES STOMACH
MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon CASTLE
strikes a pose to match

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Lucky shot
(grins)
OK not really

He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE
to the floor

KEN CASTLE (contd)
I need an audience boys

A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court KABLE looks up
slowly afraid of what he knows hell see

ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room ANGIE presses herself

close to DELIA holding her shoulders protectively

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries
to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her
eyes the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing but
ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal DELIA seems

oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation

CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor toward them

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Thats right you crawl on your
belly like a toad
(he looks to the GEEK
SQUAD sheepish)
Is this bad Im really bad
He gives KABLE a last kick KABLE collapses in front of his
DAUGHTER she looks down at him curiously

He looks up at DELIA eyes soaked with emotion then to
ANGIE They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel
that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of
what is the best action to take strategically she is looking

to KABLE for a clue

KABLES eyes go back to DELIA he tries to reach up and
gently touch her face

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Thats sweet

CASTLE steps on KABLES hand pinning it to the floor
KEN CASTLE (contd)
Alright boys you ready A true
test
He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates
KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIAS THROAT
ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at
her and she FREEZES paralyzed We can see her body strain
against invisible control raw panic in her eyes
KABLE
(desperate)

No

KEN CASTLE
Just like last time Remember

KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will his whole body
shaking

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

KEN CASTLE (contd)

Youre stronger now a little

more fight in you but I think
the end result will be about the
same

KEN CASTLE (contd)
Shh

The GEEKS look on impassive The BLADE is inches away He
looks into ANGIES eyes - she and KABLE are like one he
seems to draw strength from her finally KABLE WILLS

EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS

Suddenly

KABLEs head SNAPS around his eyes confused and in one
quick smooth movement KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the
floor RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE He claps a
hand around CASTLES neck and tries to jam the knife up into
his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short

KEN CASTLE (contd)
(freaked)
What the hell was that

The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning
Not even KABLE understands this

PONYTAIL GEEK
There are 2 networks accessing the
same IP address

Someone on the outside is sending
him commands

163 INT CASTLES COURT - CONTINUOUS

KABLES KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward Now CASTLE is
the one struggling for control he claws weakly at KABLES
hand trying to loosen it off his neck

KEN CASTLE
(panicking)
JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN

GEEK
(irritated)
Working on it

KABLES eyes are locked in on CASTLES straining with
everything he has his strength and will overpowering
CASTLE but-

KEN CASTLE
(like hes explaining the
obvious to a child)
I think it

KABLE succumbing to CASTLES control begins to move the
knife away from CASTLES belly

KEN CASTLE (contd)
You fucking do it

CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE KABLE loses
his footing sweat pouring down his face bloody drained
CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE He fights back -
every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin and

Yang veins rising in his neck
Then KABLE senses an opportunity
KABLE
Look at this knife imagine me
sticking it into your gut think

about it make it real

CASTLE laughs BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of
course he cant help but picture it

and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE
GEEK LEADER

(blank)
Oops

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

CASTLE focuses trying to pull it back out but KABLE
shoves it in deeper - CASTLES EYES BULGE Finally KABLE
TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND

The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw

her arms around her daughter

INT SIMONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SIMON
(triumphant)
YES
He drops down into the badass ROCKSTAR pose

INT CASTLES COURT - SIMULTANEOUS

and KABLE does the same
KABLE
Damn it kid

CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE glass-eyed
draining life they are FACE to FACE

KABLE (contd)
is the fuckin pose really
necessary

CASTLE face-plants on the COURT

SIMON
Sorry

KABLES body relaxes he tosses the knife across the floor
then turns to face his family

When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLES
Georgia peach accent

DELIA
Are you my Daddy Tillman

He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet
squeezing her close she SQUEEZES BACK KABLE grabs ANGIE
with his other arm and pulls her in

The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment
contract with CASTLE has just been terminated shrug
pocket their shit zip up their backpacks and fanny packs
get up and start to file out

KABLE
Wait

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9192007

GEEK LEADER stops

KABLE (contd)
Shut it off

GEEK

The GEEKS look at one another
KABLE (contd)
Its nothing to you A mouse-

GEEK LEADER shrugs

GEEK LEADER

He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK do it
The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile

GEEK LEADER (contd)
