BRAD
That’s a great idea

SARA
For a week

BRAD
Even better

SARA
Brad are you hearing me I said
Dusty My ex-husband The
children’s father The reason
reality TV has replaced quality
programming

BRAD
Yes I know But I also know that
studies show children who have a
healthy relationship with their
biological father have a thirty
percent better chance of living
healthy productive lives

SARA
Wow you are officially the first
person to use the words healthy
productive and Dusty in the same
sentence

BRAD
Look I know I’ve never met the man
but I’m sure he’s not that bad
Maybe he’s matured grown For all
we know he’s blossomed in to a man
of quality reputation and
position

EXT HOUSE - DAY
Brad stands with Sara and the kids at the front door
Off in the distance we hear LOUD MUSIC Ton Loc’s ‘Funky Cold

Medina’ blasting Then a SCREECH of tires and we see a
tricked out hot rod GTO take a corner at 60mph

The car races toward Brad’s house and then the driver does
one of those incredible stunts pulling a 180 that lands him
in a perfect parallel park on the street sandwiched between
two cars

Before Brad can react the kids run to the car

KIDS
Daddy Daddy

Then the driver gets out Meet DUSTY KAY the real dad He
climbs out of the car in an insane outfit - a mesh football
shirt football shorts with the laces tied tight around his
balls forming a ferocious camel toe

Dusty scoops up Megan and grabs hold of Dylan

DUSTY
Guys I missed you so much I know
it was only a month but to me it
felt like a year

DYLAN
It was a year Daddy

DUSTY
Oh In that case here’s a fifty

He hands them cash

MEGAN DYLAN

Dusty approaches Sara

DUSTY
Damn Sara You still look good I
just had the sweetest idea “Milfs
Gone Wild” I got the video cam in
the trunk

She gives him a polite peck hello

SARA
Nice to see you too Dusty

He doesn’t let her out of her slight hug
DUSTY

My lord how did I ever let this
one go

SARA
You didn’t Dusty Other way
around remember

DUSTY
Sorry babe I don’t I’ve got
cognitive amnesia Can’t remember a
thing before Anna Nicole’s untimely
passing Far as I know you and I

Brad and Sara share a look

DUSTY (CONTD)
Just kidding

BRAD
(false)
Good one
DUSTY

You must be the lucky guy that
stole her heart I have heard great
things about you I mean great

BRAD
Likewise It’s a pleasure to meet
you

Brad extends his hand

DUSTY
Put that thing away and bring it in
for the good stuff

Dusty wraps Brad up in a bear hug Brad’s arms at his side
trapped Dusty practically frisks him and gives a critique

DUSTY (CONTD)
Hmmm stong lats pretty decent
pecs little soft in the abs and
(then like he found a
woody )
---oh well this isn’t soft now is

It’s awkward Then they both speak at the same time

BRAD DUSTY
So Well

Awkward beat then Dusty finally speaks

DUSTY
OK look Lemme be the first to get
the awkwardness off the table I am

martial arts Let me demonstrate

He puts Brad in an arm-lock

DUSTY (CONTD)
You see Brad I come in peace I’m

town to steal back his family like
some crazed astronaut lady

BRAD
(wincing)
That’s good to know

Dusty lets go then bends back Brad’s fingers He howls

DUSTY
(ignores )
Point is I’m no bully I don’t pick
on guys just ‘cause they couldn’t
get laid in a five dollar
whorehouse on pay day with five
dollars in their pocket

He releases and then puts Brad in a choke hold

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Dusty stand beside a box with a white sheet covering it

DUSTY
-- It was so clear that I

a cocktail napkin
(real dramatic)
And this is what the Gods showed

me

Dusty pulls off the sheet revealing his INVENTION It’s a
severed MANNEQUIN ARM crudely fastened to a CHUNK OF WOOD
Brad stares at it for a long time No idea

SARA
What is it

DUSTY
A million dollar idea

Brad stares at it

BRAD
You’re here to chop the arms off
mannequins and crudely tape them to
wooden blocks

(still not getting it)
To invest In my invention

Dusty pushes it toward them

BRAD
Oh I get it
(beat)

something every red blooded
American man would have serious use

for

BRAD
Oh God Please don’t tell me it’s
some kind of masturbatory device

SARA

Brad
BRAD

What I’m sorry but after the bra
DUSTY

Allow me to introduce to you the Hi-

Fiver

With that Dusty smacks the hand and a little recording says
“Go Colts”

DUSTY (CONTD)

(sales pitch)
How many times have you been
watching the big game when somebody
makes a sick play and you reach to
hi-five and then wham - it hits you
- you’re alone You’re just
standing there like a retard with
your hand in the air What are you
gonna do What can you do Nothing
You gotta put that hi-five back in
its holster and pray for another hi-
five day With my invention the
world will never again see another
wasted hi-five And won’t that be a
better place for us all “Cause a
hi-five is a terrible thing to
waste”

(low to Brad)
That’s my copyrighted catch phrase

BRAD
Actually it’s the United Negro
College Fund’s catchphrase

DUSTY
(ignoring)
Now keep in mind this is just a
prototype but can’t you just
picture one of these in every
living room in America

BRAD
Not really No

DUSTY

CUT TO

EXT BACKYARD —- DAY

Brad takes in the scene Every kid from the neighborhood is
in his backyard engaged in a massive water balloon fight with
Dusty Dylan and Megan centered around a massive freshly
constructed tree house that has completely destroyed Brad’s
precious 200 year old oak tree The tree is mangled and
distorted with sawed off branches littering the yard

Dusty catches Brad’s eye

DUSTY
Isn’t it great bro Look at all
these kids It’s true what that
weird baseball voice guy said - if
you build it - they will come

Before Brad can answer a cop steps up to him

COP
OK Mr Whitaker we’re all done
Here’s your citation for the
destruction of a protected tree

He hands it to Brad

COP (CONTD)
One for building without a permit
One for not building to code One
noise violation One endangering
the well-being of a minor One for
each minor present

Hands him a stack of citations

COP (CONTD)
And finally one for the broken tail
light on the GTO you got out front

BRAD
But that’s not even my car

COP
I almost forgot One for housing an
unauthorized tenant

The cop walks off Sara turns to Brad

SARA
At least the kids are having a
blast right

Brad rifling through his citations

INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dusty’s got his hands over Brad’s eyes as he leads him in to
the living room

Brad sniffing hating Dusty’s fingers around his nose
BRAD

Brad tries to scream with his mouth closed

BRAD
(muffled)
Aggghhhh

But the monkey gets vicious Takes Brad down with a kick to
the shins Rips at his hair bites his ear starts tearing at
his belt

The family tries to help but the monkey is too wild Brad
tries to swat it away fight it off but the monkey puts a
sleeper hold on Brad Brad spins around trying to get it
off Spinning right through the window

Crash And then the monkey jumps out and climbs back on Brad
As the monkey goes back to work pulling off Brad’s pants a

neighbor MR LAMBERT walks by and gives a very disapproving
look

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

SARA
Still upset about the sponge bath

Brad gives a look - don’t mention that

SARA (CONTD)
Honey the nurse was in training
Besides they’re supposed to wash
you down there

BRAD
Not when their name is George
they’re not And I’m pretty sure
offering a happy ending isn’t part
of the training regimen

SARA
Honey

BRAD
I’m sorry I guess it was just hard
seeing you and the kids leave that
way yesterday

SARA
What way

BRAD
Like one big happy family

SARA
I know it must be difficult Brad
but he is their Dad they’re
supposed to be happy around him
right

BRAD
(false)
Yes
(then)
What about you

SARA
Well you’re right about me I am
happy that we’re one big happy
family But you left out the most
important ingredient to my happy
family You

BRAD
You’re not just saying that because
I have a full bottle of Vicodin

SARA
No and believe me the kids may be
having a good time with their real
dad but it doesn’t mean they’ve
forgotten about their step dad

BRAD
Youre right I’m overreacting
Hey maybe we should do something
fun with them today How ‘bout the
museum - you know they’re still
running that Picasso exhibit

SARA
(hedging)
Yeah we could do that

BRAD
What

SARA
It’s nothing Just that Dusty
promised to take the kids to the
mall today and I sort of said yes

BRAD
The mall

INT STORE - DAY

Dylan is holding up two Peyton Manning football jerseys The
blue home jersey and the white away one Brad’s with him

DYLAN
I want both

BRAD
I know you do But you’re at that
age now where you’re going to start
being faced with some serious
choices in life And each choice
that you make is not only going to
turn you into the man you will one
day be but it will also tell the
story of your life

(MORE )

BRAD (CONTD)
Now why don’t we start telling
Dylan’s story right here right
now

Beat

DYLAN
OK Chapter one - I want both

Dusty breezes in the scene

DUSTY
Then get both buddy That’s why God
created Visa

Dusty flashes his credit card

CUT TO

INT STORE - DAY

Megan proudly holds up a BB gun to Brad Brad takes it from
her and puts it back on the shelf

BRAD
I’m sorry Megan but that’s a
completely inappropriate toy for a
nine year old

Dusty steps in to frame

DUSTY
Sorry bro but I’m gonna have to
disagree with you on that one And
I know of some pretty smart old
dudes with weird wigs who would
too

BRAD
Dusty when the Constitution was
written we were primarily an
agrarian society I hardly think
the Founding Fathers intended the
Second Amendment for children in
the suburbs

DUSTY
Founding Fathers I was talkin’
‘bout Moses himself Mister
Charlton Heston

Dusty takes the gun off the shelf and hands it to Megan

DUSTY (CONTD)
Don’t forget your bb’s little
lady Nothing’s more dangerous than
an unloaded gun

Dusty walks off Off Brad’s horrified look

INT STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Dusty and the kids are at the cashier as their mountain of
stuff is being rung up The kids are thrilled Dusty’s loving
the love they give him Brad comes over

BRAD
Don’t you think this is a bit
excessive

DUSTY
Not really bro no This is just
how I roll

Brad gives up heads to Sara

BRAD
(re the excessiveness)
Can you believe this

SARA
He hasn’t seen them in over a year
so he’s spoiling them a little
‘cause he feels guilty That’s what
we divorced parents do

BRAD
Does he have to do it with blow up
dolls and heavy artillery

SARA
At least he’s spending his money on
the kids and not late night call
girls right

Megan runs over with all her bags of stuff

MEGAN
Mommy Mommy look at everything I
got It’s like Christmas only
without all the preachy stuff

Brad heads back over to Dusty as he’s signing the credit card
bill
BRAD
Do you need a hand with --
(notices Dusty signing)
Did you just sign my name

DUSTY

Brad looks at the card in Dusty’s hand

BRAD
Is that my card

DUSTY
Where

BRAD
There

DUSTY
When

BRAD
What

DUSTY
Who

BRAD

Now is that my card or not

DUSTY
(plays dumb)
I really don’t think so I believe
it is mine

Brad takes the card Shows it

BRAD
Then why does it have my name on
it
DUSTY
You have a very common name
BRAD
No I don’t
DUSTY

Yes you do How do you know my name
isn’t Brad Whitaker too

BRAD
Because it’s not

DUSTY
You don’t know that Dusty could
just be an alias Maybe my
Christian name is Brad Whitaker
Huh ever think of that No I bet
you didn’t

BRAD
Just do me a favor keep your hands
off my stuff OK

Brad walks off

DUSTY
(calls out)
You’re the one that said make
yourself at home

INT STORE - LATER

each one to the kids They laugh

SARA
I’m really sorry Brad I thought I
told you that he has cleptomania
issues

BRAD
You said he went to rehab

SARA
He did I guess he just relapsed
You know how hard recovery is

BRAD
Unbelievable

SARA
Honey it’s fine we’ll just return
everything

BRAD
Oh yeah that’s a great idea Then
he’1ll really have the kids thinking
I’m a dork

SARA
Brad the kids do not think you’re
a dork

Dusty and the kids come out of the fitting room all wearing
Brad’s exact dorky blazer and khakis outfit They all point
at each other and laugh hysterically

INT MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - SALES COUNTER - DAY

I don’t know what the problem is

BRAD
Yeah Hard to believe your
Blockbuster card didn’t work
Cashier hands back the card to Dusty
CASHIER

Brad looks at the kids who are watching nearby He can’t help
but be a good guy

BRAD
OK fine It’s the least I can do
to repay you for stealing my credit
card

DUSTY
(oblivious )
You my bro just earned yourself
another ten percent of the Hi-
fiver

BRAD
That’s really not necessary
Anything to help with your investor
meetings Because the sooner you
close your deal the sooner you’1ll
be able to well leave Right

DUSTY
Right
(small beat)
But this isn’t for my meetings bro

BRAD
It’s not

DUSTY
You really think I’d wear this
crazy suit to a business meeting

big day

DUSTY
Yeah the Daddy-Daughter dance with

He freaks out Hits the radio to turn it off but accidentally

BRAD
Yeah I noticed that when Megan
totally blew me off for the Daddy-
Daughter dance

SARA
Is that what this is about

BRAD
(like a kid)
No I didn’t even want to go to
that stupid dance

SARA
That’s too bad Megan’s going to be
sorry to hear that

BRAD
(sorry for himself)
Why would she care she already has
a date

SARA
Yeah but she was hoping to have
two dates She was looking forward
to being the most popular girl in
school that night

BRAD
Really

SARA
Really Look she even made you a
present It’s a picture of you

BRAD
(flattered)
Of me

She hands over the drawing Brad looks at it

DUSTY
Exactly That’s why I’m gonna scrap

Don’t worry I’m not bailing on you
yet bro I’ve gone back to the
drawing board Check it out

Dusty holds up a clear BOTTLE filled with YELLOW LIQUID

BRAD
Dusty if that’s a bottle of urine
I’m going to have to scream

DUSTY
Urine Now that wouldn’t make a
very nice fragrance would it

BRAD
(creeped out)
Youve designed a fragrance

DUSTY
Bingo Here give it a spritz

BRAD
No really that’s---

Too late Dusty sprays Brad’s neck

BRAD (CONTD)
(winces )
This is awful It smells like beer

DUSTY
Bingo again It is beer And not
that overpriced imported stuff
either Real American beer

BRAD
You want to sell beer as cologne

DUSTY
Think about it As you might’ve
guessed by now I’ve gotten more ass
than a park bench But what you
don’t know is I’ve gotten most of
it while I’ve been totally shit-
faced So what does that tell you

BRAD
Well like most people you probably
feel less inhibited when you’re
intoxicated and therefore more
comfortable approaching strange

women
DUSTY
No It means chicks love the stank
of booze
BRAD

Right Of course

SARA (0S)
OK gentlemen are you ready to see
your date

Megan descend the stairs Brad beaming turns to Dusty

BRAD

floor He’s fidgeting and looks out of place and frankly a
little creepy watching all the little girls dance

An old lady school marm PRINCIPAL walks nearby She spots
Brad and she gives him a quizzical look Brad makes eye
contact then quickly turns away

Montage of quick cuts

Brad drinking punch tells a nearby kid to recycle his
plastic cup

Brad bored - gets caught dunking his Oreo’s in the punch

Brad hovering by the bleachers - he’s the grown-up version of
an awkward kid at his first dance

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Brad makes his way uncomfortably through the crowd He
arrives at Dusty and Megan still dancing Brad TAPS Dusty on
the shoulder to cut in Dusty totally ignores Turns his
back Brad taps harder Still ignores Brad TAPS really HARD

girl is there filling up her cup She’s all alone

BRAD

Brad sees her Dad in a wheelchair across the gym Brad waves
The Dad doesn’t wave back

BRAD
Well if it’s OK with your daddy

happy to escort you out---

Brad reaches out puts a consoling arm on the little girl

Brad jumps up

INT CAR -— MORNING
Sara and Brad drive home from jail

SARA
At least it was just the drunk

worse
Brad gives a look

SARA (CONTD)
Well it’s true Child molestation

BRAD
Sara I did not molest anybody

SARA
I know you didn’t but come on Brad
how did you think it was going to
look when you asked a ten year old
to dance with you

BRAD
So now it’s my fault Oh that’s
just beautiful This is exactly
what he wants

SARA
What who wants

BRAD
Dusty Don’t you see whats
happening here He’s trying to
sabotage me

SARA
Don’t be ridiculous Sure he’s not
the sharpest tack but he doesn’t
have a malicious bone in his body
and frankly for the first time in
his life he’s got his priorities
straight Do you even know what he
did today

BRAD
Burned our house down

SARA
No a completely selfless act He
cancelled his plans so that he
could stay another week and be
there for Dylan’s birthday party

BRAD
Another week

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Dusty and Dylan are playing stick ball in the front yard The
front door is the backstop Brad and Sara get out of the car

DUSTY
Yo bro little stick ball

BRAD
No thanks Dusty Little tired
today Spent the night in jail
after you falsely accused me
remember

DUSTY
Prison’s nothing to be ashamed of
hombre The important thing is you
learned your lesson and you keep
your nose clean from here on in K

Brad stops dead in his tracks when he notices a freshly spray-
painted box with an ‘x’ through it on his beautiful front
door

BRAD
Did you seriously turn my front
door into a backstop

DUSTY
(all proud)
And I put up a hoop

Dusty points to a basketball rim now crudely fastened to the
house Brad is horrified

DUSTY (CONTD)
(low)
Don’t worry bro that’s on my dime

BRAD
You think I don’t know what you’re
doing You think I’m an idiot I
went to Stanford goddamnit You’re
looking at a hundred and eighty two
IQ points standing here I’ve got
the papers to prove it

DUSTY
Cool I got papers that say I can
smoke weed Legally
BRAD
OK Dusty Have your fun Laugh it
up But let me tell you this I did
a little research on your alleged
friend Peyton Manning Turns out
he’s quite the star player for the

His pounding gets slower and less powerful with each thrust
He starts to slow down His anger and frustration start to
turn to whines and almost tears

Brad gives up punching Dusty and hits the ground in
frustration Dusty bounces up Unfazed

DUSTY (CONTD)

shrugs

Brad pulls in to the driveway and his eyes go wide

REVEAL a huge birthday party already underway in Brad’s
backyard

EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Brad races out of his car and looks at his backyard The
party is well underway - fifty people in the yard

His yard has been completely destroyed A massive home-made
football field has been constructed in his backyard The
neighbors fences have been torn down to make the field It
spans four neighbors yards and is dotted with trees and
swimming pools

Stolen street lights are crudely fastened to Brad’s roof A
massive section of his roof has been removed to make room for
a press box where two announcers are currently calling the
game being played

His garden has been completely destroyed by a massive STAGE
that’s been constructed Long-haired heavy metal musicians
are playing really loudly

Brad is devastated

was all packed up ready to roll
and blow all that dough on booze
and broads like usual and then it
hit me - I should spend some of
that scratch on my kids So first I
considered setting up a college
fund and then I thought nah I
don’t wanna step on Brad’s toes
He’s probably gonna wanna cover
that whole school thing So that’s
when I decided to do the
responsible thing and put it all in
to this party

BRAD
Tell me you’re not serious

DUSTY
I know it’s hard to believe
right It’s like a real personal
growth moment for me And I owe it

dangerous He just lulls you to
sleep with his ignorance and then
kills you with his stupidity

SARA

But then Brad’s eyes move up and he sees a huge collection of
children’s drawings lovingly hung on the wall It’s the only
thing in this room that is treated with care They are
beautifully framed and lovingly displayed

Brad moves closer and inspects them Each drawing is a
depiction of all the fun stuff Dusty and the kids have done
throughout our story Drawings of them having fun at the
mall them playing in the treehouse the Daddy-daughter
dance kite boarding etc

With this incredible new invention
the world will never again see
another wasted hi-five And won’t
that make the world a better place
for all of us

(winks )

Cause a hi-five is a terrible thing
to waste
